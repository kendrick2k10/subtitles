3
00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.379
What are you doing? Pass it!

4
00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.389
What's that?

5
00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:28.047
What the fuck? Hey! Hey!
Fucking cheesedick. Pederast!

6
00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:32.343
Fucking gimp-suit-wearing piece of shit!
Not in my fucking neighborhood!

7
00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:35.679
Hey. hey! Just relax. I've come to...

8
00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:43.521
Oh. hi. I need something to write with.

9
00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:48.317
Like a tablet. or a flat thing. something.

10
00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:52.863
I mean... you can use this if you want.

11
00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.657
Oh. yes.

12
00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.701
That's great.

13
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:04.124
Ahoy. there! If you're reading this.
please don't be angry with me.

14
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.585
But I have traveled back in time.

15
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.131
Don't worry. everything is under control
despite one or two complications.

16
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:16.095
For example. you may notice I've written
this on several scraps of garbage.

17
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.180
Ooh!

18
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:29.149
Hello again. I would like
to place a bet on the sports situation.

19
00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:31.235
Hockey for money.

20
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.781
- There's my money.
- Okay. man.

21
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.741
It's a problem of context.

22
00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:41.787
I've discovered that in some situations.
you don't just need the answers.

23
00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.039
you need to show your work.

24
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.500
I don't know any of this.

25
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:50.754
You know. you could also use
that money for. like. the bus.

26
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.842
- What?
- Like. to leave.

27
00:02:57.553 --> 00:03:00.848
That's maybe the biggest difference
here. Nothing is simple.

28
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:03.851
Everything seems designed
to be slightly frustrating.

29
00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:09.189
This is a bus stop. isn't it? Oh. good.

30
00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:16.488
Big day. It's the berries.

31
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.913
Mmm.

32
00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.623
Everything is just fine.

33
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.420
No? Okay. Oh.

34
00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:36.675
Ooh. Do you still have libraries?

35
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:41.347
Did you know they kept printing physical
books throughout the 20th century?

36
00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.182
I mean. there are so many of them.

37
00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:47.186
Apparently. they just started making
them so badly. they all dissolved.

38
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.065
Incredible. Honestly. not a bad metaphor
for the century as a whole.

39
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:52.858
Hi. Ooh!

40
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.446
It does seem like I missed
a lot of pretty big events.

41
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:01.533
Much of my prepared research is.
well. stuff that's happened already.

42
00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.162
and thus is not very impressive
to people.

43
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.456
In fact. I arrived
somewhat shockingly low

44
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.668
in what you might call
immediately useful information.

45
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:12.753
But I know I can make this work.

46
00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.882
Hey. We're closing in a few minutes.

47
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.343
So if you just wanna
bring that book to the front...

48
00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:20.928
Yeah. okay.

49
00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:25.766
I'm running out of space.
so I'll keep this brief.

50
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:30.104
But if you do find this. there'll be
other notes as well buried around here.

51
00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.399
Plus a few other surprises.
Everything will become clear.

52
00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:36.443
Trust in the plan. okay?
There is a plan.

53
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.862
Your humble servant. Casper.

54
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.789
Ahem.

55
00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:51.583
Um... Um...

56
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:56.547
Sir? Sir? Hi. yeah. Um...

57
00:04:56.672 --> 00:04:59.800
I'm going to ask you to leave.

58
00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:03.679
Oh. no. Actually. I need more time.
Could you pop back later?

59
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.474
Yeah. I'm gonna
have to take you outside.

60
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.519
It's the outfit. isn't it?
Or the smell. Is it the smell?

61
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:14.940
It's actually because you slept here.
You can't do that.

62
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.735
- But also it is the smell.
- I understand.

63
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.445
We're pretty chill here usually.

64
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.156
But you have actually done
a lot of things wrong.

65
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:25.743
- Are those our...
- Yeah. No.

66
00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:27.536
- Okay.
- Don't worry about that.

67
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.079
Uh... Uh...

68
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.832
There is a plan.
You're part of something now.

69
00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.793
- Oh! Okay. thanks.
- Yeah. cool.

70
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:40.466
Okay. Cool! But I... Oh. Okay. Yeah.

71
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.389
- Hello! I'd like one. please.
- Five dollars.

72
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:51.185
Oh. Well. then. I would like the food
that is for no dollars. please.

73
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.729
Nothing for nothing. boss. Move.

74
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:06.200
Holly! Open up!

75
00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:10.287
The cops maced me.
In the face! In my face. Holly!

76
00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:13.707
- You wanna get that?
- Open the door. you flaky bitch!

77
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.670
- Fuck!
- Jesus. Hi. I guess.

78
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:21.757
- Hey. Alana.
- Fool-looking little piglets!

79
00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:25.260
Fascist Nazi fucks!

80
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.888
- Yeah. sounds like a great time.
- Yeah.

81
00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.682
Would have been nice to have
some fucking backup. though!

82
00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:33.268
Oh. I'm gonna get them
all fucking fired.

83
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.480
- Your fucking salad days are over.
- It's really fucking sparkly.

84
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.607
Those fucking fucks!

85
00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:44.113
This is getting a little intense for me.
But this was fun.

86
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.657
Oh. Actually. I'm good.

87
00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:48.283
Call me. okay?

88
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.536
Yeah.

89
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.289
Just get a fucking kiss on the cheek?

90
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.750
Bye. dreadlocks.

91
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.752
- Don't be mean.
- I'm just saying.

92
00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.047
I find it interesting that you drag along
that kind of people now.

93
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.174
The Holly from two years ago
would never.

94
00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:07.427
Well. maybe the Holly from two years ago
was a judgmental bitch.

95
00:07:08.437 --> 00:07:10.656
- You really should have come today.
- Should I. though?

96
00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:12.432
- It matters to show up.
- Does it. though?

97
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:15.477
Yeah. it does. Being shitty about it
doesn't make you right.

98
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:21.525
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm just hungry. Yeah.

99
00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:24.862
- Who the fuck is that?
- Huh?

100
00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:30.492
Oh. It's just a guy.
Come on. buddy! Get the fuck up!

101
00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.457
See? He's going.
Is that my fuckin' beer?

102
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.751
What the fuck are you doing?

103
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.758
These nachos are soul-crushing.

104
00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:49.511
It should literally be illegal
to sell shitty nachos

105
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.221
under a late-stage capitalism.

106
00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.974
That's supposed to be the deal
in exchange for our fucking souls.

107
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:58.437
It's fine. I'll just give 'em
to somebody who...

108
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:03.775
Yo. bud. Uh. do you want
some depressing corn chips?

109
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:07.905
Yes. please! Oh. wow.

110
00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.700
Mmm. These are really good.

111
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:17.039
Yeah. they're really not that good. bro.
But. um. have at 'em.

112
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.709
That outfit kind of rules.
Where'd you get it?

113
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:24.421
The future.

114
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:29.259
- I'm serious. Where'd you get the suit?
- I know that! That's a band.

115
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.887
Is that current? Are they now?

116
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:36.642
Um. I'm working door for them tonight.
so. yeah. it's very now.

117
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.977
That's fantastic.

118
00:08:40.896 --> 00:08:41.939
Don't.

119
00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.692
Hey. do you wanna go?

120
00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:50.197
Why disguise my bad intentions?

121
00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:51.990
I got nothing to hide

122
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.994
Except the tendency
to separate the part of me

123
00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.372
That's feeling too desperate to die

124
00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:03.168
I wanna thank the academy
Well. isn't it great?

125
00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.755
I'm doing something productive
with my self-destruction

126
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.258
It's the one thing keeping me sane

127
00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:13.762
How's that for your glass half full?
It's not even my best trait

128
00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:20.519
Crawling out of the hole inside of me
Try to kill 'em before I come undone

129
00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:25.649
I can tell they're on to me
I can feel it in my blood

130
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:31.446
Spilling out of the hole inside of me
Try to fill it before I come undone

131
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:36.410
But it's just a part of me
that I can't get away from

132
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:39.371
Crawling out of the hole
Crawling out of the hole

133
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.832
Crawling out of the hole inside of me

134
00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:46.628
Whoo!

135
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:52.259
Thanks a lot. We're gonna take
a quick break. We'll see you in a sec.

136
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.648
- Oh.
- Hey. Casper.

137
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.236
- Is that a cigarette?
- Sure is. pal.

138
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:16.283
Wow. Okay. Don't mind if I do.

139
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.578
Yeah. Thank you.

140
00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:28.754
Oh. shit. Oh. fuck.

141
00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.839
- You good there?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.150
There's always an off one in a pack.
Did you know that?

143
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.677
- No. I didn't.
- Yeah. it must have... Oh.

144
00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.554
- You okay?
- Yeah. So cool.

145
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.431
Very cool. Yeah.

146
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.099
Oh.

147
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.602
Actually. it's a really good time
to see this band.

148
00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.729
Mmm. yeah. I love these guys.

149
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:49.232
No. I mean. they're only good right now.

150
00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:52.069
- What?
- They get pretty bad.

151
00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:56.782
Their next recording. it's not awful.
but it's definitely a step down.

152
00:10:56.907 --> 00:10:58.909
And then they don't tour for a while.

153
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.620
And so next time they come out
and perform like this.

154
00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.789
it's actually a bit embarrassing.

155
00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:06.833
They're more famous.
but the music's bad.

156
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:11.004
It's a pretty creative way
to be a dick about music.

157
00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.632
Preemptive snobbery. Well done.

158
00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.343
- Oh. please. I'm not a dick. I promise.
- Yeah?

159
00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.596
All I'm saying is.
you should take this in.

160
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:23.266
This is a special. unique night.
Enjoy the show.

161
00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:27.354
'Cause in the future. most people
will just get a worse version of this.

162
00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:34.736
- Do you wanna do a line?
- You mean like drugs?

163
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.321
Yeah.

164
00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:41.368
- Whoo!
- Whoa. whoa. whoa! Slow down there. man.

165
00:11:41.393 --> 00:11:43.845
Alana will literally never forgive me
if I kill a homeless guy tonight.

166
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.082
- Okay. got it. Chips ahoy!
- Shh!

167
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.875
Okay. I'm quiet. I'm being quiet.

168
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.853
But. look. just to let you know.
in the future. about 30 years from now.

169
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.964
this is legal. and everyone's doing it.

170
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:57.259
Most places say. "Yeah. you can do it."
Not just this but all sorts of drugs.

171
00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:59.444
It was before my time. so I didn't
really get a chance to do it.

172
00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.796
So it's good I get to do it now.
It's feeling really good!

173
00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.157
Okay. that's great.
But you're not from the future.

174
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:07.644
Whoo! No. I am.

175
00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.772
Okay. for the sake of arguing.
I will admit

176
00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.816
that the music possibilities
are intriguing.

177
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.610
But you're saying
you can't jump back and forth. right?

178
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.529
- Mmm. Only backwards.
- Okay.

179
00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:21.074
So. like. CBGBs in the mid-'70s
would be dope.

180
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.828
but then having to live through the '80s
as a queer. Black vagina-haver...

181
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.997
- Oh.
- No fucking thank you.

182
00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.498
- Really? Not good there?
- No.

183
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.584
- Okay.
- Then you've got Alana in the mid-'90s.

184
00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.920
But. like. would Missy
even be friends with me?

185
00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.422
- Missy?
- Missy Elliott.

186
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.257
- She'd be your friend.
- She'd be my friend.

187
00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.092
- Yeah. I think so.
- Ugh.

188
00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.345
But then there's all the bullshit
afterwards. so I don't think I'd do it.

189
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:45.807
History's a fucking trash pile. bro.

190
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.018
Okay. interesting take.

191
00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:52.314
If I'm being honest. I don't even think
I'd. like. kill baby Hitler.

192
00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.442
or skullfuck David Duke. or whatever
the. you know. the moral equivalent is.

193
00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:59.613
- Wait. Did you say "skullfuck"?
- Skullfuck. like...

194
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.866
- Jesus!
- Neo-Nazi prick.

195
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.243
Just fuckin' skullfuck him
in the fuckin' face...

196
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.496
- No. don't do that.
- It just...

197
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.540
It feels like way too much work. right?

198
00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.210
To do something
that would actually matter. you know?

199
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.712
Yeah.

200
00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:17.923
- Does that make me a bad person?
- No.

201
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.549
- You're not a bad person.
- No.

202
00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:23.053
Remember. you got me nachos and drugs.

203
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:26.348
Yeah. But that's not enough. Right?

204
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.768
I mean. I almost feel
like it should be enough.

205
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.853
but I'm not actually good at anything.

206
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.648
- So that's bad. I don't know.
- Come on.

207
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.442
- Yeah.
- You are good at stuff.

208
00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:40.654
I used to care more. Like. a lot.

209
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:44.783
But it's like. every time
I found something to care about.

210
00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.993
I'd eventually find out some detail
about that thing.

211
00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:50.288
or movement. or person.
and it turns out. they're also shitty.

212
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.791
Punks turn out to be Nazis.
Hippies turn out to be rapists.

213
00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.418
White people in sweaters
turn out to be Nazi rapists.

214
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.964
- Everything's a trap.
- Everything's a Nazi rapist.

215
00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.299
Everything's a fucking Nazi rapist trap.

216
00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.553
- That's shocking.
- Yeah.

217
00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:06.763
Nothing's just good.

218
00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:13.061
What if I was to tell you
that everything does work out?

219
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.690
And that you don't need to feel so bad?

220
00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:22.529
- Hmm. It sounds fake.
- Okay. Hold this.

221
00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.949
- Yeah.
- I've got a point to make.

222
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.243
I'm getting up into my serious position.

223
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.452
Yep.

224
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.247
- Here I am.
- Okay.

225
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.957
- You see me?
- Mmm-hmm.

226
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:37.544
Okay. Things do get a lot better.
They really do. I promise.

227
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.004
- They do?
- Yeah.

228
00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:41.172
- There's a plan.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:44.759
Okay? So you don't have to worry
about it. Pressure's off.

230
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.850
- Prove it.
- Okay. but if I prove it...

231
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.188
can I crash on your couch?

232
00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.985
Please!

233
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.529
I need somewhere to sleep.

234
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:08.867
- Yeah. man.
- Okay. I will prove it. What's the time?

235
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.829
- Like. 2:00 maybe.
- Really?

236
00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.540
- I don't fucking know.
- Okay. Come on. we've gotta go.

237
00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.267
- I'm gonna prove this to you now.
- Okay.

238
00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.960
- No. you take it. I don't want it.
- What?

239
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.670
- I'm gonna prove it to you!
- Okay.

240
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.213
- Come on!
- Fuck!

241
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.966
- Oh. are you okay? Here.
- Yeah.

242
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.134
Jesus!

243
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.471
- So. this place. huh?
- Yeah. this is it!

244
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.390
Okay.

245
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.102
Here. We'll sit here in this fatal booth.

246
00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:45.528
- Oh. my God. I can't believe we're here.
- Okay. So. what's the plan here. champ?

247
00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:47.989
Oh. my God. There he is.
This is the guy.

248
00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.700
I know everything about this man.
Watch this.

249
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.328
Hey.

250
00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.750
- Okay. he's coming over.
- All right. um...

251
00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.378
What would you like?

252
00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:06.424
- Hello. Percy.
- Sorry. Have we met?

253
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.886
Uh. no. Uh. well. we have now.

254
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:13.181
Um. how's your sketches coming along?

255
00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.601
Have you sold any yet or still no luck?

256
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.897
Yeah. I'm... I'm not...
I don't know who you are.

257
00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:25.276
I'm sorry. Um. at this stage. we'll just
get two coffees. please. Thank you.

258
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.781
- Wow.
- What the hell was that? Who is he?

259
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.866
Okay. so he's nobody at the moment.

260
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.954
But after he dies. people discover
his work. He's an amazing artist.

261
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:39.499
He does these little cartoons.
This guy is a genuine cult hero.

262
00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:43.670
- Well. he becomes one. Posthumously.
- Oh. okay. sure.

263
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.548
So. like. if the Garfield guy was also
the Confederacy of Dunces guy?

264
00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.342
- What'd you say? Garfield guy?
- Yeah. Like the cat.

265
00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.303
- The orange cat.
- A cat? That does not sound good.

266
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.431
- Big eyes.
- This guy is good.

267
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.058
- Okay.
- Yeah. Very popular with nihilists.

268
00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.601
Interesting.

269
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.104
Thank you. Percy.

270
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.190
Love your work!

271
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.658
Are you changing. like. the fabric
of reality or whatever just by existing?

272
00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.076
No! Of course not.

273
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.162
You kill some butterfly
and the world ends. yeah?

274
00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.814
There's a thing like that.
Jurassic Park and shit.

275
00:17:19.898 --> 00:17:21.307
I don't know. I haven't been there.

276
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:23.059
Or is it like.
with every small decision.

277
00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.419
you create a whole new reality.

278
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.338
like a multiverse
with an infinite number of timelines?

279
00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:29.215
No. That's ridiculous.

280
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.511
There's only one timeline
and one reality. This is it.

281
00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.138
And it's not really a "fabric."

282
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:40.059
It's more of a mushy blob.
Mushy blob of reality. Imagine that.

283
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.353
So some little differences can happen.

284
00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:47.275
but the mushy blob of reality
just kind of congeals over the changes.

285
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.320
And then...
time keeps on rockin'.

286
00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.865
- "Congeals?"
- Yeah. I like to say congeals.

287
00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:58.036
So only really the big things matter.
like. um. life and death.

288
00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:02.707
Major cultural shifts or political stuff.

289
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.296
- Wait. What time is it?
- It is 2:13 in the morning...

290
00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:10.965
Oh. that's perfect. Right. Look outside.

291
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.718
Now. remember the word "balls." Okay?

292
00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.094
- You looking? Here we go.
- Yeah.

293
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.556
Three. two. one.

294
00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.647
Come on. Okay. I might have been a bit
ambitious with the old countdown there.

295
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:30.068
Forget the countdown. It's definitely
gonna happen any moment now.

296
00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:33.279
I'll try the countdown again.

297
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.157
Three... No. I'm not gonna bother
with it. actually.

298
00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.618
But it's definitely gonna...
Any... any moment now.

299
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:42.789
Mmm. You know what? This has been fun.
But. um. I think we just...

300
00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:45.750
Yes!

301
00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.675
The explanation turns out
to be quite boring.

302
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.970
It's just a shipment that comes loose
from a cargo plane.

303
00:18:57.095 --> 00:19:00.014
But weird. eh?
I mean. people remember this.

304
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.310
Oh!

305
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.691
- What the...
- Yes!

306
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.904
What did I tell ya?

307
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.712
What are you trying to say to me?

308
00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.550
Am I a joke to you?

309
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.218
Oh. wow. That's the moment.

310
00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:42.140
Here we go. And there's the crate.

311
00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:45.435
Yeah. This actually really messes him up.

312
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.687
This is great! Thank you!

313
00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:51.357
Listen. um. I'm breaking
several key personal rules here.

314
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:54.736
So just be aware
that if you try to kill me or something.

315
00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.614
I'll. you know. kill you.

316
00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:01.784
Okay. yep.
That's. uh... That's fair enough.

317
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.787
I own several knives!

318
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.334
- So. you know...
- Got it!

319
00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:14.172
How do I look?

320
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:17.884
Do you. like... know everything
I'm about to say?

321
00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:23.598
No. I mean. do you know
every conversation from. say. 1847?

322
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:27.727
Or would you just know some scattered
facts about that general time period?

323
00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.228
Shit. not even.

324
00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:32.732
- So. what do you know exactly?
- It's complicated.

325
00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.985
I mean. a lot of information and media
gets lost over time.

326
00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:41.407
Long-term accessible data storage
isn't really what you guys are good at.

327
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:46.120
So I'm left with patchwork.
digital residue. and metadata.

328
00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.873
Basically a lot
of very specific statistics.

329
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:52.794
figures. and numbery things
with very little context.

330
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.921
Imagine looking at a map
with a microscope.

331
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:56.673
- That's what I did.
- Like. as a job?

332
00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:59.425
Yeah. I just found what I could
and patched it together

333
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.803
into some kind of picture of the past.

334
00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:04.973
Uh-huh. And you bring stuff back
with you in your time machine?

335
00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.475
No.

336
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.270
There are no time machines.

337
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.982
So. what do you travel in. then?

338
00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.486
It's kind of like a singularity.

339
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.615
A miniature black hole.
But not really a black hole.

340
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.036
- Like a portal?
- No.

341
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.206
You know what? Yes.
They're highly regulated.

342
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:33.334
The first one pops up
in about 50 years' time from now.

343
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.879
Way up north. They all seem to come
to this time period.

344
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.424
Wait. They all go to this time?

345
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:42.093
Yeah. pretty much.
All within a couple of decades.

346
00:21:42.118 --> 00:21:44.654
Well. isn't that significant somehow?
That they all lead here?

347
00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.597
- I don't know.
- Okay.

348
00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.725
Oh. by the way.
when you go through a portal.

349
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.643
you can't take anything organic. okay?

350
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:55.148
So nothing that can rot or corrode.
No air holes.

351
00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:58.735
And no technology.
Nothing that gives yourself away.

352
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.362
So I wrote a lot of things down
on my hands.

353
00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:04.782
Notes on both hands.
and my memory. which I lost a bit of.

354
00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.951
But. yeah. a lot of writing down for me.

355
00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:09.078
Mmm. Like. um. sports stats?

356
00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:12.248
- Hey!
- Oh! Shit. sorry.

357
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:15.293
I've gotta be careful.
But. yeah. sports.

358
00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:19.380
I know the winning teams from baseball.
hockey. and the other one.

359
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:22.467
- For the next 20 years.
- Next 20 years?

360
00:22:22.492 --> 00:22:25.069
Mmm-hmm. I thought it would be useful.
but I don't think it will be now.

361
00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:28.514
- Um. definitely useful.
- Really?

362
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:31.726
Sure. Private bookies. online gambling.

363
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:34.896
The playoffs aren't for another few
months. but if we know where it's going.

364
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.857
we can totally clean up
playing the long game.

365
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:40.359
- Really? You know how to do that?
- Sure.

366
00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:43.196
It's easy because.
um. I'm an actual. real person.

367
00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:45.740
so I own a valid ID and a credit card.

368
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.493
- Oh. that sounds great!
- Okay. What else?

369
00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:50.787
Uh. well. I do have
some lottery information.

370
00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:54.582
Yes! Dope.
Oh. my God. We have to drink to that.

371
00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:57.001
Okay. but don't get too excited
because we've gotta be careful.

372
00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:59.045
Okay? Nothing too big
on those winning fronts.

373
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.797
- Yeah.
- Nothing life-changing.

374
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:03.257
Should you. like. officially
not be telling me any of this?

375
00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:05.635
Officially. yeah. I should not be
telling you any of this.

376
00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.679
Yeah. man. I'm not gonna lie. feels like
you should have had a better plan.

377
00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:12.058
No. this is the plan.
This is phase one. making money.

378
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.593
Which really
I didn't put enough thought into.

379
00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:17.663
- So. what's phase two?
- Saving the world.

380
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:23.194
- Cool. Glad somebody's on that.
- Cheers.

381
00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:31.452
You do know the consequences
of all of this?

382
00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:34.997
- Um. we get paid.
- I mean. you could make some real money.

383
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.207
- Yeah.
- Get really rich.

384
00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:38.084
- Yeah.
- Famous.

385
00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:40.545
Be the kind of person
who makes so much money.

386
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.588
they could make
some real changes in the world.

387
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:43.881
Mmm.

388
00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:49.178
But you can't do that. Ever.
Here's the deal.

389
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:52.890
You'll never have to worry about money.
but you've gotta cruise.

390
00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:55.351
You can't use that money
to make a name for yourself.

391
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:56.769
Stay anonymous.

392
00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.774
And just live comfortably
for the rest of your days.

393
00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:03.609
Do you think you could do that?

394
00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:08.406
Honestly. that sounds great.

395
00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:10.491
- Well. all right!
- Yeah.

396
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.372
Are there more of you?
Is anyone gonna. like. follow you?

397
00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:19.333
No. I doubt it.

398
00:24:29.844 --> 00:24:31.304
Hello!

399
00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:52.241
Welcome!

400
00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:57.038
- Stasis or Static?
- Yes! Thank you!

401
00:24:57.163 --> 00:25:00.833
- Uh. could you repeat. please?
- Stasis or Static?

402
00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:03.753
I'm ready. Just point me
in the right direction and I...

403
00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:05.338
- Thought so.
- Hello!

404
00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:21.395
Hello!

405
00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.945
- Don't wait up.
- Yes. Doris.

406
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:45.836
I made it.

407
00:25:45.962 --> 00:25:47.088
Hello!

408
00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:49.257
Stasis or Static?

409
00:25:49.382 --> 00:25:52.176
Wait. Wait.

410
00:25:58.266 --> 00:26:01.686
Right. Now where am I?

411
00:26:01.811 --> 00:26:05.189
Happy birthday to you

412
00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:09.860
Happy birthday to you

413
00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:14.073
Happy birthday. dear Doris

414
00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:17.451
Happy birthday to you

415
00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:20.621
Happy birthday. dear...

416
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:21.956
Okay.

417
00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:26.919
Companion module off.

418
00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:30.548
Delete that fucking file.

419
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:40.516
- Hello!
- Fuck!

420
00:26:45.187 --> 00:26:47.440
- Shit!
- Ahh!

421
00:26:47.565 --> 00:26:49.775
Yeah. you run. you twisted pervert!

422
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.362
Get the hell out of my neighborhood!
God damn it!

423
00:26:54.739 --> 00:26:56.490
Hey! Hey! Can I help you?

424
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.368
- Hey! No. no. no!
- Out of my way!

425
00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:02.163
- I need to find that man.
- You listen to me. lady.

426
00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:07.543
I don't care about whatever goddamn
Illuminati hide-and-seek sex games

427
00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:10.087
you sickos are playin'.
but this is my neighborhood.

428
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:12.715
And I'm not gonna have my kids
dealing with this shit.

429
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.926
So you get the hell out.
and don't come back. either of you!

430
00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:21.140
You understand me. lady?
Hey! Do you understand me. lady?

431
00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:23.601
Yes. I understand you. sir.

432
00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:25.227
- Good.
- I apologize.

433
00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:26.854
Oh.

434
00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:28.856
Will you hold this for me. please?

435
00:27:29.607 --> 00:27:32.818
- Hello!
- What the fuck was that?

436
00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:38.199
That's what I thought. It's blue.
That means your life has no weight.

437
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:40.951
Hey. fuck you!

438
00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:51.587
Now. after
an incredible third-period turnaround.

439
00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:55.216
Edmonton has less than 30 seconds
to grab victory from the jaws of defeat.

440
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:57.267
- There's a pass. another pass.
- Watch this shit.

441
00:27:58.094 --> 00:28:00.763
- And there it is! Score!
- What?

442
00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:04.725
- Oh. yes! Did you see that shit?
- I don't fucking believe it.

443
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:09.438
Holy shit! I love sports now.
Oh. my God. Oh. yeah.

444
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:14.360
Yo. Mitch! It's Holly.

445
00:28:14.485 --> 00:28:17.363
- Ah. God. uh...
- You know what this means?

446
00:28:18.072 --> 00:28:23.327
Payday. motherfucker!
Do you know why I always win?

447
00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:29.375
'Cause I've got arcane knowledge
from the goddamn future! Shit!

448
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.837
The crazy thing is.
it all pretty much works out all right.

449
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:35.923
That's what everyone
essentially wants to hear.

450
00:28:35.948 --> 00:28:38.692
I've never been great at connecting
with people at the best of times.

451
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.053
but there's something special
about talking to someone

452
00:28:41.178 --> 00:28:43.806
with a defined expiration date.

453
00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:49.019
It makes things easier somehow
if you both know. well. it's gonna end.

454
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:50.813
Safer too.

455
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.819
Plus. it means you can usually
get their stuff afterwards.

456
00:28:56.944 --> 00:28:59.071
And there's so much great stuff.

457
00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:06.662
I wanted to pass these on to my son.

458
00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:10.249
- But he don't appreciate them.
- Let's have a look.

459
00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:14.545
Wow.

460
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:21.093
- Oh.
- I just want them to be cherished.

461
00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:23.804
I'll tell you what.
if you leave these with me.

462
00:29:24.722 --> 00:29:26.307
I promise you they'll be remembered.

463
00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:27.558
Oh.

464
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:30.478
Very much so.

465
00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:39.028
Tell me more about the future.
Tell me something else nice.

466
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:43.532
Okay. sure. Take food. for example.
Micro-agriculture.

467
00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:45.301
It gets to the point
where anyone can grow

468
00:29:45.326 --> 00:29:47.495
almost anything they want
in a single room.

469
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.705
so no one actually runs out of food.

470
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:52.500
- Oh. that's wonderful!
- It is good.

471
00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:56.045
- Oh. what's this?
- Those are Cathy's.

472
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.673
Scientific surveys
from her research days.

473
00:30:00.382 --> 00:30:02.051
She studied bugs.

474
00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.261
Well. this is tangible. first-person.

475
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:07.389
boots-on-the-ground observations
with context.

476
00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:09.517
It's exactly
what we're missing back home.

477
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.894
I've gotta say.
I've been to three places.

478
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.146
and you. Betty. are my best partner.

479
00:30:14.271 --> 00:30:19.443
- This is dynamite.
- You should meet a nice girl.

480
00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:22.446
It's not that easy.
I'm a bit complicated.

481
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:24.907
Oh. young men always say that.

482
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:27.201
Well. what I mean is. the kind of person

483
00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:30.162
that would accept
that I'm a man from the future

484
00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:33.541
might not be the person
I want to spend my whole life with.

485
00:30:33.874 --> 00:30:36.502
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh. I didn't mean you. though.

486
00:30:37.086 --> 00:30:40.339
No. I love your company.
You're different.

487
00:30:40.464 --> 00:30:43.717
Well. of course. Because I'm dying.

488
00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.678
No.

489
00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:49.306
Didn't have to say it like that.

490
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:55.479
Well... thanks for everything. Betty.

491
00:30:57.648 --> 00:31:00.276
You're a very nice boy.

492
00:31:03.362 --> 00:31:06.031
I'll see you again. okay?

493
00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:08.867
Of course. dear.

494
00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.245
Bye.

495
00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:31.056
How do you even find payphones anymore?

496
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:33.225
There's 803 of them
left in the city.

497
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.227
I know where
each and every one of them are.

498
00:31:35.352 --> 00:31:36.729
Good for you. champ.

499
00:31:36.854 --> 00:31:39.481
Meet me in the diner in one hour.
And bring the thing.

500
00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:44.987
Would it be considered ironic
that you have terrible timing?

501
00:31:45.112 --> 00:31:47.489
I don't think so. I'll see you soon.

502
00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:58.459
- Here's your usual.
- Thank you. Hey. how's Percy doing?

503
00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:01.003
- He's looking a bit rough.
- You're obsessed.

504
00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:03.964
- He's fine.
- Not for long.

505
00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:07.718
- What?
- Hmm? Nothing. I said. "Yum."

506
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:09.386
Hmm.

507
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.432
- You got it!
- I did!

508
00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:16.268
Oh. wow.

509
00:32:16.894 --> 00:32:20.314
Yes. you are now the proud owner
of a portable X-ray machine.

510
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.358
- For some reason.
- This is awesome!

511
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:24.526
You planning on telling me
what it's for?

512
00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:28.906
- Phase two. saving the world.
- Right. Phase two.

513
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:30.658
I told you I had a plan.

514
00:32:30.783 --> 00:32:32.342
- I can't tell you everything.
- I know.

515
00:32:32.476 --> 00:32:34.470
"It's better if you don't know
too much about me.

516
00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:39.041
"Anything further I tell you
will have grave consequences."

517
00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:41.794
- I didn't do... I did not do this.
- Yeah. it was very intense.

518
00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:44.338
- You went like this.
- Did I say "grave"?

519
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:47.341
- Okay. All right. Fair enough.
- Okay. I got something else for you.

520
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:50.135
- It's a prepaid phone.
- Oh.

521
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.763
They're mostly used by children.
but you don't need an ID.

522
00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:55.808
and you won't have to rely on payphones
like a '90s drug dealer.

523
00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:58.727
- Oh. it opens.
- And... Bah!

524
00:32:58.852 --> 00:33:01.271
- Oh. that's awesome.
- Not bad. right?

525
00:33:01.397 --> 00:33:04.108
- Look at that!
- And I've got a lotto run tomorrow.

526
00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:06.360
- This is actually working.
- It is!

527
00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:10.239
Yes. man. I've decided
that a life of leisure agrees with me.

528
00:33:10.364 --> 00:33:12.866
Good. Leisure's awesome.

529
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:14.868
Now. I actually have something
for you to do.

530
00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:16.595
Yeah. yeah. whatever...
whatever you need.

531
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.166
Okay. Can you please deliver this
to Betty Chambers?

532
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:24.211
She lives in a nursing home
called Better Horizons.

533
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:27.047
And it has to be tomorrow
before noon. Okay?

534
00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:30.134
Earlier the better.
Definitely before noon.

535
00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:31.860
Normally. I wouldn't ask you to do this.

536
00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:34.722
but tomorrow I do have
a. uh. appointment of sorts

537
00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:37.015
which I've been waiting a long time for.

538
00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:40.894
- Wow. Very cryptic.
- Very cryptic.

539
00:33:44.148 --> 00:33:45.190
Fuck.

540
00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:54.408
Thank you.

541
00:33:55.743 --> 00:33:57.745
Wait. Like. right here.
right here or...

542
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.079
- Yeah!
- All right.

543
00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:01.665
Well. this is like
the middle of nowhere. man.

544
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.209
- So. I drop you. I'm...
- Yep.

545
00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:07.087
- ...I'm not coming back. so...
- Yeah. this is perfect.

546
00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:09.256
Oh. okay. I'm leavin'.

547
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.509
Drivin' away.

548
00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:50.422
- Hey. Chuck.
- Heyo!

549
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.134
- I like your red box.
- Thanks. Chuck.

550
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:58.347
This should cover the next month.

551
00:34:58.472 --> 00:35:01.016
- Plus a bit extra.
- Appreciate it. brother.

552
00:35:05.462 --> 00:35:07.389
You've been searching
for me again. haven't you?

553
00:35:07.414 --> 00:35:09.883
Yeah! I admit it. I tried again.

554
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:14.279
I dug deep. too.
Let me tell ya. I always find something.

555
00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:19.409
And I got nothing.
No government numbers. no photos.

556
00:35:19.535 --> 00:35:23.914
Bubkes. 100% legit. off the grid.

557
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:28.210
Holy shit. brother. I am impressed.
You gotta tell me how you did it.

558
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:31.129
Wish I could. Chuck.
But I need you on the grid.

559
00:35:31.338 --> 00:35:33.257
I need your name on those land rights.

560
00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:36.134
Yeah. okay. Okay.
But you gotta tell me eventually.

561
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.721
Deal? Before they give us all
the fuckin' microchips.

562
00:35:39.847 --> 00:35:42.015
That doesn't happen. Chuck.

563
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.435
So you say. brother. So you say.

564
00:35:45.561 --> 00:35:47.938
- Hey. I was wondering...
- Uh-uh. No peeking.

565
00:35:48.814 --> 00:35:52.860
Fuck. Fine!
I'm taking my money and fucking off.

566
00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:19.112
Brother. I'm not one to pry.

567
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.951
A man's privacy is sacred.
I believe that.

568
00:37:24.076 --> 00:37:27.746
- And I respect our arrangement.
- And I appreciate that. Chuck.

569
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:29.039
But. I mean...

570
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:33.669
what the fuck are you doin'?

571
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.463
It's a fair question.

572
00:37:36.588 --> 00:37:39.299
Have you ever heard
of nuclear semiotics?

573
00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:43.428
- No. I have not.
- Okay.

574
00:37:45.973 --> 00:37:49.226
Nuclear semiotics.

575
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:52.604
The idea behind it is basically
sending a message into the future

576
00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:54.564
without the use of language.

577
00:37:55.983 --> 00:37:57.901
- Like in Chinese.
- No.

578
00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:02.781
Without any words at all.
So. instead. something like...

579
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:05.367
radiation.

580
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:11.707
Even mild radiation emanating
from a spot where it should not be.

581
00:38:11.832 --> 00:38:13.041
Mmm-hmm.

582
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:15.502
You see.
this is your family land. Chuck.

583
00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:18.588
Always will be.
But I don't have a family.

584
00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:22.092
And as you saw.
I don't even have an identity.

585
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:26.221
And so. buried here
in these radiation holes.

586
00:38:26.346 --> 00:38:30.017
this is my way
of leaving something for the future.

587
00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:34.479
- Far out.
- Yeah.

588
00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.648
That's... that's deep. brother.

589
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:41.153
Hey. what kind of something. though?

590
00:38:41.278 --> 00:38:43.321
Ah.

591
00:38:43.447 --> 00:38:46.408
Well. that falls under a man's privacy.

592
00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:49.286
Okay. Well. fuck me. then.

593
00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:51.997
You just keep that cash coming.

594
00:38:52.122 --> 00:38:54.916
you can bury
all the goddamn secrets you want.

595
00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.418
I appreciate that.

596
00:38:58.879 --> 00:39:01.465
Hmm.

597
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.300
Here's a weird one for you.

598
00:39:03.425 --> 00:39:06.094
Tomorrow. I've got an appointment.

599
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:08.555
Could be a bit risky.
but I'm excited about it

600
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.891
because I've been planning it
for a long time.

601
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.146
On the other hand.
things are going pretty well.

602
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:20.609
I've got money now.
I can buy a hot dog whenever I like.

603
00:39:20.734 --> 00:39:23.779
So I'm thinking
maybe I should just stick the course

604
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:27.032
and forget about this appointment.

605
00:39:27.157 --> 00:39:28.742
What do you think?

606
00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:36.166
I had a theory for a while
that you was. uh... ex-special ops.

607
00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:38.752
- Oh. yeah?
- Blackwater or something.

608
00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:40.295
Sounds about right.

609
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:44.633
No. you're much too doughy
to be an operator. So that's out.

610
00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:48.386
Now I'm thinkin'
you're some kind of gentleman thief.

611
00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:50.430
Some George Clooney type.

612
00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:55.185
And you're talkin'
some sort of one-last-job scenario.

613
00:39:56.353 --> 00:39:57.938
It's a bank heist. isn't it?

614
00:39:58.063 --> 00:40:01.900
Just because if it is.
I think you should do it.

615
00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:07.531
I say you gotta grab life by the balls.
and I say fuck the bank.

616
00:40:07.656 --> 00:40:10.534
Yeah. sure. Fuck the bank.

617
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:12.786
Fuck the bank.

618
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:14.454
Anyway. it's not a bank heist.

619
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:19.501
So you say. brother.

620
00:40:20.043 --> 00:40:22.921
So you say.

621
00:41:48.757 --> 00:41:49.799
Okay.

622
00:41:51.384 --> 00:41:54.179
All right. Percy. Let's do this.

623
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.503
Shit!

624
00:42:47.816 --> 00:42:50.360
I first drew this guy when I was nine.

625
00:42:51.236 --> 00:42:54.572
My teacher. Mr. Whitaker.
told me it was pretty good.

626
00:42:54.698 --> 00:42:57.867
It's the first compliment
I remember getting.

627
00:42:57.993 --> 00:43:01.162
I kept drawing him
over and over and over again.

628
00:43:01.288 --> 00:43:03.331
That's all I ever did for years.

629
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:09.004
I even failed Mr. Whitaker's stupid class
because of him.

630
00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:16.511
Drawing him made me feel better.

631
00:43:18.722 --> 00:43:21.599
I felt it mattered.

632
00:43:24.894 --> 00:43:28.857
Drawing him would make me matter.

633
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.903
But everybody thinks they matter.
or they will one day. but we don't.

634
00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:38.992
Nobody matters. Nobody cares.
No one is a hero.

635
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:45.165
This is us. This is me.

636
00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:49.336
We're not important.

637
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:50.837
We are...

638
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:57.552
rubber clowns bouncing
on the surface of reality.

639
00:43:59.387 --> 00:44:02.766
No. that's... that's terrible.

640
00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:05.310
What a shit metaphor.

641
00:44:08.313 --> 00:44:10.023
I should have practiced.

642
00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:14.611
Wow.

643
00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:21.576
Percy! No!

644
00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:46.226
Hi. Betty. You did ask me
to let you know when it was time.

645
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:47.936
It's today. I'm afraid.

646
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:51.064
I should have told you yesterday.
but I just couldn't do it.

647
00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:55.360
It was great meeting you. Betty.
Time to say your final goodbyes.

648
00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:57.904
Please destroy every trace
of this card immediately.

649
00:44:58.029 --> 00:44:59.489
The future depends on it.

650
00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:02.617
Fuck!

651
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.182
Fuck.

652
00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:37.277
Right. that was a bit messy.
But I still think we can make this work.

653
00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:39.112
- I was just trying...
- I know.

654
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:42.282
I know what you were trying to do.
But. look. Percy. I'm here to help you.

655
00:45:42.407 --> 00:45:46.035
- Okay? I'm from the future.
- I know you. You're that guy from...

656
00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:48.663
From the diner. yes. I'm a regular.

657
00:45:48.788 --> 00:45:50.707
Okay?
So we're practically friends already.

658
00:45:50.832 --> 00:45:54.002
Look. if you wanna shoot me.
just do it.

659
00:45:54.127 --> 00:45:56.754
No. I'm not gonna shoot you!
You don't even shoot you.

660
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.299
Which is why I'm surprised
to see this ancient gun.

661
00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:02.051
- No. you end up jumping over the edge.
- What? No!

662
00:46:02.077 --> 00:46:03.878
You do. But don't worry
about that right now.

663
00:46:03.903 --> 00:46:06.739
I wanna show you something.
Take a look at this.

664
00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:10.059
- What?
- That's yours. right?

665
00:46:10.185 --> 00:46:14.272
Scared little cape guy?
Percy. I'm a fan.

666
00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:16.691
I was one of the guys
who figured out who you were.

667
00:46:16.816 --> 00:46:19.861
Pretty rad. right?
So here's what happens.

668
00:46:19.986 --> 00:46:24.324
After you leap over the edge.
people do find your little doodles.

669
00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:29.454
And. Percy. they catch on.
Hard to believe. I know. but it's true!

670
00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:35.502
We found podcasts. imprints. images.
Quotes all over the place.

671
00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:39.839
Even graffiti. Your work becomes
part of a larger nostalgia thing.

672
00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:44.552
It helps people process the weird world
and all the changes that are happening.

673
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:50.892
Percy. you inspire people.
That's a pretty good thing. right?

674
00:46:53.728 --> 00:46:56.397
Wow! I'm gonna grab a seat.

675
00:46:56.523 --> 00:47:00.735
Look. Just... I'm sorry. okay?

676
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.030
I know I'm being more blunt
than I normally would with people.

677
00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:08.076
And you're handling this really well.
So. well done.

678
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:10.136
It's probably the gun. right?
This is a bit of a bummer.

679
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:14.415
I'm gonna put it on the ground. okay?
There we go.

680
00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:20.838
Gun's gone. Eyes on me. okay?
Here I am. That's it.

681
00:47:20.964 --> 00:47:23.466
Percy. I considered not coming.
I couldn't resist.

682
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:27.762
Imagine if you got to meet. I don't know.
what is it. the Garfield guy?

683
00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:31.641
- I hate Garfield.
- You don't like the Garfield guy? Oh.

684
00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:36.604
Okay. well. how many people get to end
things on their own terms as a nobody

685
00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:38.690
and then become immortalized?

686
00:47:38.815 --> 00:47:40.066
Not many.

687
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.402
Most people of. you know.
historical significance

688
00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:44.696
are not accessible before they pass.

689
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:47.824
So you are a unique case.

690
00:47:47.949 --> 00:47:51.494
So here's what we'll do.
We'll chat. A bit of back and forth.

691
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:54.038
At the moment. it's mainly forth.

692
00:47:54.063 --> 00:47:56.140
But I'll get a bit of back from you.
and that'll be great.

693
00:47:56.165 --> 00:47:59.419
And we could fill out your backstory
for future generations.

694
00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:02.463
And then you can do your thing
over the edge.

695
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:05.008
content with the idea
that you've made an impact.

696
00:48:05.133 --> 00:48:07.552
in more ways than one
if you know what I mean.

697
00:48:07.677 --> 00:48:10.680
Sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
But you've made an impact on the world.

698
00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:14.225
And gained some new truths
about our very existence.

699
00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:18.021
I mean. people who I've spoken to so far
seem to quite like the idea of that.

700
00:48:18.146 --> 00:48:19.772
How does that sound?

701
00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:26.362
- What if I don't?
- Don't what?

702
00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:28.114
All right! No. no. no. no! No. no.

703
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:31.159
Calm down. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

704
00:48:31.284 --> 00:48:34.370
What if I just leave? What would happen
to your little prediction then?

705
00:48:35.747 --> 00:48:37.832
- You... you can't leave.
- Why?

706
00:48:37.957 --> 00:48:42.962
Because you've gotta do your thing.
Percy! We all have to do our thing!

707
00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:46.591
Yours is over the edge there.

708
00:48:48.134 --> 00:48:50.887
Look. I'm beginning to realize
I shouldn't have come here.

709
00:48:51.012 --> 00:48:54.098
Okay? This was a whole mistake.
I'm just gonna go.

710
00:48:54.223 --> 00:48:58.811
Okay? I'm gonna leave you to it.
All right?

711
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:02.774
So you're on your own. But you're
definitely gonna do your thing. yeah?

712
00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:05.068
- Once I'm out of your hair?
- No!

713
00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:07.528
Well. then. we're back to square one!

714
00:49:07.654 --> 00:49:08.988
Wait.

715
00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.207
What the hell's that about?

716
00:49:19.332 --> 00:49:22.251
Oh! No! Percy!

717
00:49:25.088 --> 00:49:28.424
- Stop it!
- Ah. please. Plea... Sorr... Sorry.

718
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:30.551
- That was foolish. wasn't it?
- Sorry. Please.

719
00:49:30.677 --> 00:49:33.096
Look. I've made sacrifices. okay?

720
00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:35.181
I've been careful.

721
00:49:37.642 --> 00:49:38.685
Kind of.

722
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:42.939
But you're not gonna
screw this up for me.

723
00:49:44.357 --> 00:49:48.194
- This is supposed to happen.
- No.

724
00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:57.787
- Well. then. I'm sorry.
- Do it! Shoot him!

725
00:50:04.127 --> 00:50:06.504
Oh. God! I can't do it.

726
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.217
Shit.

727
00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:21.102
Do you know
about the Spanish aristocracy

728
00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:24.439
who were sent down
to South America in the 1800s?

729
00:50:24.564 --> 00:50:26.065
I think so.

730
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.735
Spanish royalty sent them down
to be the face of the empire.

731
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.322
to uphold the laws.
and bring order. you know.

732
00:50:34.574 --> 00:50:39.245
Back then... going back and forth
wasn't in the cards.

733
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.164
They went. and they stayed.

734
00:50:42.623 --> 00:50:44.709
They had everything
they could want. of course.

735
00:50:44.834 --> 00:50:47.837
They had all the money in the world.

736
00:50:47.962 --> 00:50:51.674
Land. and servants. and...

737
00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:59.807
But they could never go home.

738
00:51:00.641 --> 00:51:02.477
Would only ever occasionally
even interact

739
00:51:02.602 --> 00:51:06.981
with somebody who spoke
their own language or had the same...

740
00:51:09.192 --> 00:51:12.737
cultural background.
let's say. that they did.

741
00:51:14.489 --> 00:51:18.117
The position was a great honor.
but it was also a real burden.

742
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.453
Sounds lonely.

743
00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:23.956
Yes. it is.

744
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.711
Oh...

745
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:40.890
What the fuck is that?

746
00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:47.021
If your boss knows the winning ticket.

747
00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:48.898
why don't you just buy the winning ticket?

748
00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:52.276
Technically. one of these tickets
bought at that location on this day

749
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:55.905
is a winner. so gotta buy 'em all.

750
00:52:00.243 --> 00:52:02.537
- And he's not my boss.
- Whatever you say.

751
00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:06.624
What is that supposed to mean?

752
00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:10.002
I just think it's sketchy. man.

753
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:12.380
Like. you're all in
with some fuckin' white dude

754
00:52:12.505 --> 00:52:15.675
who has you at his beck and call.
taking risks for him and shit?

755
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.969
Do you even know what his real game is?

756
00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:21.055
Have you actually thought
about what you're participating in?

757
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.020
Sorry. Just sayin'.

758
00:52:30.565 --> 00:52:32.725
Do you know what I've been doing
these past few months?

759
00:52:34.694 --> 00:52:37.154
I built a system. Alana.

760
00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:40.241
I've got bookies working off each other.

761
00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:44.078
I've got two credit cards
making automated offshore bets for me.

762
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.998
I've built a network of lesbians

763
00:52:47.123 --> 00:52:49.876
and made a schedule
tailored to specific times and places

764
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:52.503
to buy scratch tickets. okay?

765
00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:57.884
I've never built something before.
I'm good at it. and I'm getting paid.

766
00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:02.346
I'm happy for you.

767
00:53:04.473 --> 00:53:06.559
Totally worth giving up
everything you believe in.

768
00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:10.104
Jesus. Sorry we can't all sell
rich women their placentas back to them.

769
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:12.773
That is not all a doula does. Holly.

770
00:53:12.899 --> 00:53:16.068
Whatever! It's all bullshit.
It's performance.

771
00:53:16.903 --> 00:53:18.988
It's like all the fucking marches.
the protests.

772
00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:22.033
all the interminable "community meetings."

773
00:53:22.158 --> 00:53:26.829
All it did was give us something
to say we did. It's just ego shit.

774
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:31.334
And I'm tired of it. okay?
I don't... I don't need it anymore.

775
00:53:34.337 --> 00:53:35.880
Well. congratulations.

776
00:53:43.763 --> 00:53:45.932
- Fucking what?
- Holly! I need you!

777
00:53:46.057 --> 00:53:47.975
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?

778
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.052
- Let me tell you where I've been.
- Oh. doesn't matter.

779
00:53:50.077 --> 00:53:51.912
Look. I need you here.
This is important.

780
00:53:51.938 --> 00:53:56.609
Mushy blob of reality. remember?
23 Woods Ave. now if you could. please.

781
00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:59.695
Okay. I'll be there soon.

782
00:54:02.031 --> 00:54:04.742
Hey. look. You won.

783
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:36.482
There you are. you little fucker.

784
00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:58.295
- Yep. Up here. Thanks for coming.
- What's going on? What happened?

785
00:54:58.421 --> 00:55:01.799
Okay. So essentially what's happened
is something hasn't happened to someone.

786
00:55:01.924 --> 00:55:05.261
So I need your help
to help it happen. essentially.

787
00:55:06.595 --> 00:55:08.597
You're a very disappointing time traveler.

788
00:55:08.723 --> 00:55:10.808
- Hmm.
- Can I have some specifics?

789
00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:13.561
- Whose place is this?
- Okay. just keep an open mind.

790
00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:16.856
Percy. I'm back!

791
00:55:16.981 --> 00:55:20.401
- Yo. what the fuck?
- Yeah. all right.

792
00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:23.529
Oh. there you are. Brought a friend.

793
00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:27.116
- Remember this guy?
- Oh. um... Hey. man.

794
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:30.077
Do you know this man?
He tried to kill me.

795
00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:32.413
- What?
- No. Come on now. Percy.

796
00:55:32.538 --> 00:55:35.166
You know that's not true.
You tried to kill you.

797
00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:39.420
- I saved the guy. I'm a hero.
- Holy shit. Is that a fucking gun?

798
00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:41.464
Yes. But don't panic. okay?

799
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:45.342
I'm just gonna slowly take it out.
all right? Everybody be cool.

800
00:55:45.468 --> 00:55:48.721
I'm gonna put it on the table.
There we go. Okay?

801
00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:52.933
There it is. On the table.
We just need to figure this all out.

802
00:55:53.059 --> 00:55:54.894
Figure what out?
Did you kidnap this guy?

803
00:55:55.019 --> 00:55:57.772
No. No. Don't nod. Percy. You know I...

804
00:55:57.897 --> 00:55:59.982
Look. you can't kidnap someone
in their own place.

805
00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:02.860
- Yes. you can!
- No. you can't! I don't think.

806
00:56:02.985 --> 00:56:05.112
I'd have to check on that.
That's a rule somewhere.

807
00:56:05.237 --> 00:56:08.032
But regardless of that.
we do have to get rid of him.

808
00:56:08.157 --> 00:56:09.742
- No!
- Shit!

809
00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:12.870
- No!
- Percy. you... I told you!

810
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:15.456
He knows.

811
00:56:16.332 --> 00:56:19.335
Fuck you. man! Not cool.

812
00:56:19.502 --> 00:56:21.921
You just made me an accessory.
or whatever.

813
00:56:21.946 --> 00:56:24.123
Do you know what happens
when they find someone who looks like me

814
00:56:24.148 --> 00:56:26.233
breaking into some meek-ass
white dude's home?

815
00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:28.844
I've probably left fucking CSI prints
and shit everywhere.

816
00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:32.890
They're gonna fuckin' track me down
with one of those purple-light cum-guns!

817
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.767
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know!

818
00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:36.644
- Thinking's not my forte.
- Yeah.

819
00:56:36.769 --> 00:56:41.148
Okay? Which is why I need your help.
He is not supposed to be here. okay?

820
00:56:41.273 --> 00:56:43.918
Look. if I don't fix this.
it's the end of the road for both of us.

821
00:56:43.943 --> 00:56:46.695
- Maybe for everyone.
- So. what. you wanna kill him?

822
00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:50.116
No. I just need you to convince him
that he has to die.

823
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.663
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Nope.

824
00:56:59.083 --> 00:57:01.919
Look. I know it's weird. okay?
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

825
00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:03.462
No. no. you're not.

826
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:06.298
You're getting me to stick my neck out
to fix your mistake.

827
00:57:07.967 --> 00:57:10.136
I went to see that Betty woman today.

828
00:57:10.261 --> 00:57:13.139
- She was dead. man.
- Wait. What time did you get there?

829
00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:16.142
Before noon like I stipulated?

830
00:57:17.852 --> 00:57:19.979
- I mean. maybe I was a bit late.
- Oh.

831
00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:22.940
See. that's why
when someone from the future

832
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:25.568
tells you something important.
it's important.

833
00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:28.362
Okay! Maybe this is a sign.

834
00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:30.156
- A what?
- A sign.

835
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:33.117
An opportunity. you know? I mean. like.
the world's fucked up. right?

836
00:57:33.242 --> 00:57:36.495
Look at this place. Look at this guy.
Maybe we can help him.

837
00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:42.209
This is a chance to start making. um.
a positive impact... or something.

838
00:57:42.334 --> 00:57:46.172
So the exact opposite thing to what
I told you was vitally important.

839
00:57:46.255 --> 00:57:48.132
No! You already know things work out.

840
00:57:48.257 --> 00:57:51.719
Okay. but maybe it works out
because you told me about this stuff.

841
00:57:51.844 --> 00:57:55.598
Maybe I'm the solution.
It's like. um. a... a loop or some shit.

842
00:57:55.723 --> 00:57:58.934
No. it's not. And. no. you're not.
I'm 100% certain.

843
00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:00.769
There could be a loop.

844
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:08.861
It's not a loop. okay? It's not a thing.

845
00:58:10.196 --> 00:58:14.116
Do you remember why I work with you?
Why I trust you with stuff?

846
00:58:14.241 --> 00:58:16.660
It's because
you're not significant. okay?

847
00:58:16.785 --> 00:58:19.830
Nothing you do
will ever have a consequence.

848
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:21.624
But that's a good thing for me.

849
00:58:23.167 --> 00:58:24.960
This is really important.

850
00:58:31.592 --> 00:58:33.219
- I'll help you. okay?
- Yes.

851
00:58:33.344 --> 00:58:37.056
So this is really fucked up.
And we're not killing anyone. okay?

852
00:58:37.139 --> 00:58:38.307
Okay. no.

853
00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:41.685
As long as he dies.

854
00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:45.814
Well. I'm open to other ideas.

855
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.708
Can we just. like.
buy him a bus ticket up north.

856
00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:49.401
and tell him to stay quiet or something?

857
00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:51.528
No chance.
That is way too risky.

858
00:58:52.596 --> 00:58:55.524
Well. I'm gonna need some suggestions
from you outside of straight-up murder.

859
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:57.801
I know. I know! Just wait.

860
00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:05.167
Okay. we gotta go. Yeah. Might be
an idea to get out of here anyway.

861
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:07.711
So we'll grab Percy.
We'll go back to my bunker.

862
00:59:07.836 --> 00:59:11.006
- We'll figure it out there.
- Oh. fuck.

863
00:59:14.218 --> 00:59:17.513
Percy! I think
you blocked the door by accident.

864
00:59:19.265 --> 00:59:20.432
- Hello.
- Wait.

865
00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:22.559
Does he have a fucking landline
in there?

866
00:59:22.685 --> 00:59:26.188
What's a landline? A phone? Percy!

867
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:29.316
We know you've got a landline in there.
Get off it. We've gotta go!

868
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:31.819
- Percy Sullivan?
- Yeah.

869
00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:35.406
Oh. there you are. Mr. Sullivan.
I'm so glad you're not dead.

870
00:59:37.324 --> 00:59:39.159
- You are?
- I truly am.

871
00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:42.955
Oh. Jesus. He's obviously calling
the cops. We need to go.

872
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.349
Who are you talking to in there?
It's not the cops. is it?

873
00:59:45.374 --> 00:59:48.627
- Do you want to be a hero. Mr. Sullivan?
- Percy. please!

874
00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:50.254
Come on. We can figure this out!

875
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.048
Sorry about that. mate.

876
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:59.888
- So. are we going somewhere?
- Yes.

877
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.563
Just here. thanks. Perfect.

878
01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.568
Okay. All right. let's go.

879
01:00:17.573 --> 01:00:20.993
- Is that your car?
- No. Come on.

880
01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.454
Is that not a bit weird?

881
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.998
It'll just be someone
who stopped for a pee in the woods.

882
01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.833
Don't worry about it. Come on!

883
01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:38.886
This is not assuaging my fear
that you're gonna murder me.

884
01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:43.015
- It's cool. Percy. I promise.
- We're almost there. You'll see.

885
01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.350
We'll figure this out.

886
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.063
Chuck!

887
01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.483
Well. well. well. look who's here.

888
01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:54.485
- What have you done?
- Me?

889
01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:58.739
You've been harboring this sex-slave
gimp suit on my daddy's land.

890
01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:02.326
You brought the CIA
onto my fucking door!

891
01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:04.778
What are you talking about. you idiot?
I thought we were friends.

892
01:01:04.803 --> 01:01:06.772
Percy. now!

893
01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.625
- Oh. fuck!
- No! I'll fucking kill you. Percy!

894
01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:14.838
- Stasis or Static?
- What? You're from home?

895
01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:16.757
Hello!

896
01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:22.930
- Stasis or Static?
- I don't know the code.

897
01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:27.976
I know that it is a code.
I don't know what it is!

898
01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:30.646
Please. Look. everything's okay. okay?
I promise!

899
01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:41.782
- Why are you here?
- Stop it!

900
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.952
- You've had months. What have you done?
- Nothing.

901
01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:49.415
Please stop hitting me.

902
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.711
- How are you planning to stop it?
- Stop what? I don't know what you mean!

903
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.844
I don't know what you mean.

904
01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:03.011
No!

905
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.765
What the fuck is that?

906
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:07.933
Hello!

907
01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:11.520
- What the...
- No. don't.

908
01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:15.023
I know you have a plan.
You've spoken of a plan.

909
01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:19.027
- So. what is the plan?
- I was just bored!

910
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:23.532
- Wha... what?
- Yeah. bored.

911
01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:27.077
I didn't have anything going on
back home. I was lonely.

912
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:30.539
I just thought it would be cool.
come to the 21st century. you know?

913
01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:34.460
I mean. it's not as cool as the 20th.
yeah. but it's still. you know. it's...

914
01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:38.755
Look. I found a portal accidentally.

915
01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:43.510
And instead of reporting it. I did
some prep. and I went through. okay?

916
01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:46.054
I had no one back home
to say goodbye to. so I just went.

917
01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.849
And I'm here. and I've done nothing.
I've changed nothing!

918
01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:53.353
No. no. no. no. But you live here
in a bomb shelter like a terrorist.

919
01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:57.900
Yeah. because it's off the grid. okay?
I'm out of harm's way here.

920
01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:01.695
I mean. no one's gonna step foot
on this guy's property for years.

921
01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.241
until some clerk discovers a buildup
of unpaid taxes and his corpse

922
01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:07.659
in a couple of decades.

923
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:08.952
Wait. What?

924
01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:12.956
Look. I've not spoken
to anyone meaningfully

925
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.834
that wasn't already on their way out.
apart from Holly. okay?

926
01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.587
But she knows nothing
and doesn't matter.

927
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:24.051
The holes and the radiation.
you told everybody about a plan.

928
01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:27.304
Yeah. because when you say
you've got a plan. people listen to you.

929
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:32.226
So I guess my plan was... have fun.

930
01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:37.189
And along the way.
preserve some forgotten art and history.

931
01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:42.945
- You know. collectibles.
- Really? Honestly?

932
01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:45.697
That was your plan?

933
01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:49.910
To leave your whole life behind
and come here

934
01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:54.373
and just. like. dick around
and collect shit?

935
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.501
What kind of psychopath does that?

936
01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.547
Me.

937
01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.592
Ooh. I... I can't believe this.

938
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:09.888
Look. back home. my life had no purpose.
I was so bored.

939
01:04:11.807 --> 01:04:16.311
Look. everything was fine
until Percy screwed it up. okay?

940
01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:20.065
It wasn't supposed to go that way.
and I tried to fix it. I really did.

941
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.235
But I couldn't.
I couldn't bring myself to...

942
01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:28.824
Look. I know it's a mess now.
but Holly hasn't done anything.

943
01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:35.872
Um... What are...

944
01:04:35.998 --> 01:04:39.334
It's some meditation stuff
from the future.

945
01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:42.546
It's New Age. It's weird.

946
01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.965
You basically...
You put yourself into a trance.

947
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.383
Be quiet!

948
01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:51.054
Be quiet.

949
01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.576
Well. can I just say this?
The fact that you're here

950
01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:59.271
means you pretty much made
the same decision as I did.

951
01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:03.692
- So are we that different?
- I have a job. you little shit!

952
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:06.194
I'm supposed to be here.

953
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.740
I'm the Sentinel
for this entire district.

954
01:05:09.865 --> 01:05:11.950
I'm supposed to stop people like you.

955
01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.661
Well. no. that's not right
because you're not a terrorist.

956
01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.706
You're... worse.

957
01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:22.085
I'm not supposed to stop people like you
because we honestly didn't think

958
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.880
that people like you
were stupid enough to exist.

959
01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:33.180
Look. I know it's a mess.
But we can fix this.

960
01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:34.848
- Huh!
- Yeah. we can.

961
01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.559
I mean. Chuck's heard a few things.
but look at the guy.

962
01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.269
He's... he's got no friends.

963
01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:43.273
- Hey. fuck you. brother!
- I'm just saying. you know?

964
01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.942
- What. this man? This man here?
- Hello!

965
01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:51.365
Oh. Jesus.

966
01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:58.914
- So. you're not a terrorist.
- No! Why are you killing people?

967
01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:01.625
I mean. that's gotta be way worse
than anything I've done.

968
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.711
Why? All these people
are gonna die anyway.

969
01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.004
What's that?

970
01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:07.881
The Convergence
resets so much of the world

971
01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:09.925
that literally anything
that happens before it

972
01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:14.888
which doesn't directly impact those
events is... is completely irrelevant.

973
01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:18.642
Yeah. but that's not. like.
for a long time. right?

974
01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:20.769
Pathetic.

975
01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:26.942
- Uh. what is the Convergence?
- Why live your life in squalor?

976
01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:28.568
Why?

977
01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:34.116
And adhere to all these little rules
and behaviors

978
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:37.369
that change absolutely nothing
except make you less comfortable?

979
01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:43.291
- I like this place.
- Oh. that's almost adorable.

980
01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:47.504
Do you know. our leaders
use the portals all the time?

981
01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:51.967
Proper ones. Not that pathetic
little anomaly that you stumbled in on.

982
01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:55.721
A good chunk of our leadership
retires to Pre-Convergence days

983
01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:58.056
and lives out their lives in luxury.

984
01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:00.267
In fact. the hegemon who hired me

985
01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:03.353
is living in a Spanish castle right now
and hunts people for sport.

986
01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.522
Bitch! What is the Convergence?

987
01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:06.898
Oh!

988
01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:10.277
Hmm. Okay.

989
01:07:10.402 --> 01:07:13.530
In 53 years.
within an eight-month period.

990
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:17.075
the planet experiences
simultaneous megathrust earthquakes

991
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.245
and a solar storm
that wipes out huge swaths

992
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.205
of digital information and satellites.

993
01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:26.752
The population loss. along with a lack
of proper communication networks

994
01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:30.881
and an already tenuous public trust
in institutional authority.

995
01:07:31.006 --> 01:07:35.135
leads to a period of global upheaval
and the fall of most major governments.

996
01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:37.763
Billions die.

997
01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:45.103
But in the end.
once the failures. parasites.

998
01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:47.522
and whiners are washed away.

999
01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:54.446
the people who matter come back
from up there and down there

1000
01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:58.784
and find a way for the rest of us
to live in paradise as nature intended.

1001
01:08:03.455 --> 01:08:06.875
- You fucking knew about this?
- I mean...

1002
01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:09.711
Yeah.

1003
01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:15.717
I mean. I don't know. It just...
It happened so long ago. okay?

1004
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.219
You'll probably never see it.

1005
01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:20.347
I just had to keep things
the way they're supposed to...

1006
01:08:20.472 --> 01:08:26.770
- Oh. my God. Fuck the both of you.
- Holly. please. We're working it out.

1007
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:30.165
So. what now?
Are you gonna kill us?

1008
01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:32.567
- Well...
- I mean. there's better options.

1009
01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:34.903
If you really have no intention
of stopping it.

1010
01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:39.491
then all of this has been for nothing.
which is very irritating.

1011
01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:45.455
But there's no reason you have to die.
I've been. uh...

1012
01:08:46.873 --> 01:08:48.917
a little lonely lately.

1013
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.420
My therapist is real shit.

1014
01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:55.882
and I could use somebody to talk to
who actually remembers home.

1015
01:08:57.008 --> 01:09:01.721
You know. if you had been a terrorist.
I'd have killed you already.

1016
01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:05.225
But an idiot. a loser?

1017
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.773
- I can work with that.
- Well. I mean...

1018
01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.776
I know we're in a bit
of a rough patch right now.

1019
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:18.321
But I'm sure we can be friends.

1020
01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:21.950
- Yeah. Yeah. I'd like that.
- Hmm.

1021
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.070
I mean. there's definitely... There's
definitely a connection. isn't there?

1022
01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:27.606
Well... we've got...

1023
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.916
- Ooh.
- Hmm.

1024
01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:34.838
But I tell you who's ruining the vibe.
Holly.

1025
01:09:34.963 --> 01:09:39.009
- Maybe we should let her go.
- What? Oh. no. Not now.

1026
01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:40.302
- Oh. shit.
- No.

1027
01:09:40.427 --> 01:09:41.803
- You see?
- Hello!

1028
01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.681
If she disappears right here and now.
it doesn't matter.

1029
01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:48.768
But now that she knows.
we can't let her live.

1030
01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:51.730
- Either of them really. just to be safe.
- Oh. God.

1031
01:09:51.855 --> 01:09:54.399
Realistically speaking.
there are only about 120 people

1032
01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:58.028
who could really make any difference
to things. but I like to be thorough.

1033
01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.655
Excuse me.

1034
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.203
- I forgot you still had that!
- Fucking shoot her. Percy!

1035
01:10:07.329 --> 01:10:08.747
- Go!
- Just let me go.

1036
01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.249
- I don't care about them.
- What?

1037
01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:13.919
Oh. fuck!

1038
01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:17.422
Isn't it so unhygienic how everything's
still made of metal here?

1039
01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:19.132
It's so primitive.

1040
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.593
I can almost feel it
corroding in my hands.

1041
01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.094
Yeah. it's an old gun.

1042
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:27.349
All the same. it is still
strangely satisfying to hold.

1043
01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:36.149
Quiet.

1044
01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:39.903
Hello? I can hear you in there.

1045
01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:45.408
- There's no use in pretending.
- Are you alone?

1046
01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:50.914
I am completely alone. Stasis or Static?

1047
01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:56.211
- The moment is mine.
- Oh. good.

1048
01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.380
I'm coming down now.

1049
01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.387
What the hell?

1050
01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:09.724
- What?
- What the fuck?

1051
01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:15.188
- Oh. hey. guys! Long time. no see.
- Is that me?

1052
01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.400
Oh. shit. shit. shit!

1053
01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:20.986
I felt that.

1054
01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.655
Oh. shit! Stop it!

1055
01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:31.287
- Holly?
- I've got the thing. I've got the thing.

1056
01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:33.123
- What do I do?
- Go! Just get out of here.

1057
01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:34.416
No!

1058
01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.629
Oh!

1059
01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:42.507
That is adorable.

1060
01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:44.467
Oh.

1061
01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:47.929
You gotta mean it. dear.

1062
01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.850
Shit.

1063
01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:56.980
Hello!

1064
01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:03.361
- No.
- Fuck you. cop.

1065
01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:08.908
Shit.

1066
01:12:09.034 --> 01:12:11.369
- You did it!
- Oh. shit. That's nasty.

1067
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.122
- Oh. my God. That was amazing!
- Oh. fuck.

1068
01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:21.796
You okay. Holly?

1069
01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:25.717
Holly? You okay. buddy?

1070
01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:29.137
Oh. there he goes.

1071
01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:35.685
See you. Percy!
Doesn't really matter now. right?

1072
01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.313
It's probably for the best.

1073
01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.525
So are you gonna untie me or...

1074
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:45.144
Were you seriously not gonna tell anyone
about this apocalypse shit?

1075
01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:47.046
Look. Holly. it's not my place. okay?

1076
01:12:47.072 --> 01:12:48.740
- I can't...
- Oh. Jesus!

1077
01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:52.702
- We good?
- Yeah! We're good.

1078
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:56.414
- Um. thanks for the save.
- Yeah. no probs.

1079
01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.834
I was a bit worried that you and I
might explode when we saw each other.

1080
01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.836
I'm glad that didn't happen.
Where's Percy?

1081
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:06.591
- Oh. he took off.
- Oh. damn it! Shit. shit. shit!

1082
01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.468
Holly. you gotta go get him.

1083
01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.096
Fuck that guy. Let him get lost
in the fucking woods.

1084
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:15.141
Holly. no. it's the Convergence.
It's because of him! It's because of us!

1085
01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:19.395
- It's the time loop thing!
- See? I told you it was a fucking loop!

1086
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:22.190
Yeah. you were right!
That's why I'm here. I need your help!

1087
01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:26.286
- I need you to kill him.
- Wait. What? No. I can't.

1088
01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:28.104
He causes the death
of billions of people!

1089
01:13:28.129 --> 01:13:29.631
Come on! He held a gun to your head.

1090
01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:31.866
- Wake up! This is it!
- Holly. I don't know about that.

1091
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:37.539
Shh! Come on. It has to be you.
I've tried and failed twice.

1092
01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:39.916
This is the most important thing
you could ever do.

1093
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:54.848
We're not done here.
I'm still pissed at at least one of you.

1094
01:13:54.973 --> 01:13:56.641
Holly. don't! You don't have to do this.

1095
01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.351
Go. Holly.

1096
01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:04.941
- You're not gonna hurt him. right?
- No. It's in my best interest.

1097
01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:06.359
Without him. there's no me.

1098
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.446
Good luck!

1099
01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:11.698
Oh. wait!

1100
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.496
Whoo!

1101
01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:23.334
Wow! I can't believe I pulled that off.

1102
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.588
Look at this old place.

1103
01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:30.383
Takes me back to when I was here.
What a trip!

1104
01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:32.844
Um. look. obviously
you've been planning this for a while.

1105
01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.846
but you're freaking me out right now.

1106
01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.806
What's going on?

1107
01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.975
You're right. It has been a long time.

1108
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.561
But not me. We.

1109
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.900
The first go around
didn't end too well.

1110
01:14:47.025 --> 01:14:48.943
- No!
- Hello!

1111
01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.779
Oh!

1112
01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:57.452
After Doris killed Holly.
Percy-boy actually grew some backbone.

1113
01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:02.081
He took her down.
She underestimated the guy.

1114
01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:04.250
So did we. to be fair.

1115
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.544
But then he didn't let me go.

1116
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:09.964
He heard enough about the Convergence
that he decided to stop it.

1117
01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:13.092
He kept me. or us. here for years. man.

1118
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:16.262
Fashioned himself
as some kind of revolutionary hero.

1119
01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:20.600
He had our notes. And he had access
to all of Doris's stuff.

1120
01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:22.285
He made me tell him
whatever I remembered

1121
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.938
about what was coming
until it stopped coming true.

1122
01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:27.106
That's exactly the kind of question

1123
01:15:27.232 --> 01:15:31.152
that brings our society to a halt.
the kind of question...

1124
01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.695
He changes it.

1125
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.199
I mean. he talks to enough people.
stirs enough shit.

1126
01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:39.786
He changes everything.
Now who knows what's gonna happen?

1127
01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:45.458
It took me way too long
to get myself together enough to escape.

1128
01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:53.007
It was too late to stop him.
but I could still go back.

1129
01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:59.013
I still remembered the coordinates
of the first portal that ever showed.

1130
01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:04.143
Not easy to get to. Then I spent
about a month waiting for it.

1131
01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:06.729
It was a bad time.

1132
01:16:07.939 --> 01:16:09.399
But then...

1133
01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:14.654
Landed a full two years
before we got here the first time.

1134
01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:17.115
Not the most convenient.
but pretty good.

1135
01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.159
Plenty of time to make sure
we don't interrupt Percy-boy

1136
01:16:20.285 --> 01:16:22.996
and that he does
what he has to do the first time.

1137
01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:24.330
Incredible.

1138
01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:26.207
But here's the thing.

1139
01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.460
Even with a plan.
it's a long time to just wait around.

1140
01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:33.006
With everything I knew.
it was easy to get set up.

1141
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:37.051
So to kill time. I really leaned
into the whole hedonism thing.

1142
01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.554
I have to say.
it was a great couple of years.

1143
01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:40.638
Whoo!

1144
01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:42.849
Might have overdone it a bit.
to be honest.

1145
01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:52.191
What day is it? Sunday?

1146
01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:57.196
Nah. bruh. This shit is Monday.

1147
01:16:57.322 --> 01:17:00.825
Oh. fuck! Okay. no! Just go!

1148
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:04.287
I admit it. I messed up. okay?
My brain was fried.

1149
01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:06.372
I even got the wrong roof.
can you believe it?

1150
01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.166
Oh. shit!

1151
01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.001
Oh!

1152
01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.337
Oh. there he is.

1153
01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:16.382
Do it! Shoot him!

1154
01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:22.722
Oh. God! I can't do it.

1155
01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:28.353
God! What is wrong with me?

1156
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:31.939
Are you kidding me?
We mess up our second chance?

1157
01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:35.610
How did we fuck up so badly?

1158
01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:39.405
I know. I know. okay?
Believe me. I know.

1159
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.282
And then I figured
our next inflection point

1160
01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.576
isn't till we're all down here together.

1161
01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:46.454
Problem is. originally.
that's not for another three years.

1162
01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:48.498
Wait. What?

1163
01:17:48.623 --> 01:17:52.919
You see. the first time I come through.
after Percy refuses to die.

1164
01:17:53.044 --> 01:17:54.796
Holly manages to convince me

1165
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:56.672
that he should live down here
in the bunker.

1166
01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:58.674
which I reluctantly accept.

1167
01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:03.513
But then eventually. Doris still finds us.

1168
01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:07.475
You see. she tracks us
because of those radiation holes.

1169
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.353
There she is. yeah.
That little gift for the future?

1170
01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:12.647
Well. that really backfires.

1171
01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:14.982
Wait. But then...

1172
01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:17.485
Look. I couldn't wait
another three years. I just couldn't.

1173
01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:20.071
I mean. what if I screwed up again?
I couldn't handle it.

1174
01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:24.409
I learned an awful lot about Doris
while Percy held me hostage.

1175
01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:25.910
Her phone number. for one.

1176
01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:33.459
- What the fuck is that?
- And it worked!

1177
01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:37.422
Once I got you all here. everything
played out exactly like it did before.

1178
01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:39.674
Stasis or Static?

1179
01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:46.889
So the timeline just kind of congeals
over the changes and keeps on rockin'.

1180
01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:49.642
- Mushy blob of reality.
- Fascinating.

1181
01:18:49.767 --> 01:18:52.186
But why couldn't you
have saved me earlier. hmm?

1182
01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:55.690
Look at my face.
She spent half an hour bashing my face.

1183
01:18:55.815 --> 01:18:57.942
Calm down. mate.
I'm no oil painting. all right?

1184
01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:01.696
I was psyching myself up. okay?
This was a big moment for me.

1185
01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.032
And why did you let Holly...

1186
01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.578
Where are you going?
Can you at least untie me?

1187
01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:10.304
I'd love to.
but I've gotta give Holly more time.

1188
01:19:10.388 --> 01:19:13.975
I'm hoping she kills the guy. Killing
two birds with one stone if you like.

1189
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.044
- What do you mean?
- Well. I've tipped off the cops. Yeah.

1190
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:19.922
So Doris was right.
Holly is a loose end.

1191
01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:21.799
And basically she doesn't really matter.

1192
01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.193
- Doesn't matter?
- I mean. in the grand scheme of things.

1193
01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.304
Don't get me wrong.
I mean. I do like her.

1194
01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:29.932
But the most important thing
is that we are not arrested.

1195
01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:33.227
And. of course. that Percy dies.
I'm sure you appreciate that by now.

1196
01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:35.354
So. basically. Holly takes him out.

1197
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.415
and then the cops arrive.
and they arrest Holly.

1198
01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.193
- That's the plan.
- Sounds horrible.

1199
01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:42.920
You should try being me
and living through the fact that she died.

1200
01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.698
I had to witness it. okay?
That's horrible.

1201
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:48.075
One of several memories
I don't want in my head anymore.

1202
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:50.369
At least this way.
she goes to jail and doesn't die.

1203
01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:52.914
That's a step up.
So. Percy's out of the picture.

1204
01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:55.708
He can't ruin the future anymore.
Holly's in the slammer.

1205
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.211
Bit of a bummer. but no loss to history.
And then there's us.

1206
01:19:59.337 --> 01:20:02.006
Now. as you know.
we can't seem to pull the trigger.

1207
01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:05.801
Too weak. But I think Holly can do it.
I believe in her.

1208
01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:08.554
But if she does screw up.
we're gonna have to have another go.

1209
01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:12.058
Oh. and one more thing.

1210
01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:14.810
There can't be two of us.
It's too weird.

1211
01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:17.730
And we've spoken to each other
for too long now.

1212
01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:20.942
I mean. it doesn't make any sense.
So one of us has to go.

1213
01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:23.194
I had a quick vote in my head.
and I voted myself.

1214
01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.071
- What?
- I hope this is not gonna hurt you.

1215
01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:26.447
I know mentally. it might.

1216
01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.783
But it's for the best.
Try not to think about it.

1217
01:20:28.808 --> 01:20:30.651
I probably shouldn't have done it
in front of you.

1218
01:20:30.676 --> 01:20:32.153
- But it's too late now.
- Oh. no. no.

1219
01:20:32.178 --> 01:20:34.472
I'm sorry. Good luck.
Be a better person. Good night!

1220
01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:38.501
No!

1221
01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:41.587
Jesus! Fuck!

1222
01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:45.341
Right in front of me!
You... Fuck! I'm an idiot.

1223
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:49.262
Oh. that's me fucked for life.
That's counseling.

1224
01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.397
Oh. Jesus.

1225
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:04.610
Holly! Holly. wait up!

1226
01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:07.154
It's all good.
We're gonna stop this thing. okay?

1227
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.657
Holly? Holly!

1228
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:13.035
- No. stop! Please go away!
- No. no. no! No. no.

1229
01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.414
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna work this all out. okay?

1230
01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:20.209
Hey. man. Sorry for the delay.
But. um. we've actually been talking.

1231
01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.420
- Holly. he's gotta go.
- Oh. God!

1232
01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:25.089
No. no. it's cool. man. really.
We've talked about it.

1233
01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.466
And he's not gonna do
that Convergence thing.

1234
01:21:27.592 --> 01:21:29.193
We're gonna make sure it doesn't happen.

1235
01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:32.555
Holly. that's the whole thing!
Okay? He stops it!

1236
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.683
He screws the whole future up.
It has to happen.

1237
01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.561
No. I won't stop anything. I swear.

1238
01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:41.606
God damn it. Percy!
Yes. you will! You have to!

1239
01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:45.109
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1240
01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:47.586
Why are you trying to change things
when you know it works out?

1241
01:21:47.612 --> 01:21:51.532
Who does it work out okay for exactly.
huh? Maybe we can do something.

1242
01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:54.160
Maybe there's a way
without killing billions of people.

1243
01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.996
I don't make them die.
It's not my fault.

1244
01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.873
It's not my responsibility.

1245
01:21:59.232 --> 01:22:00.766
Jesus. You're like a parody
of a white guy.

1246
01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:06.380
Look. I've just been through something
really. really existentially dark.

1247
01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.566
And quite frankly.
I could do with some leeway here.

1248
01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:10.468
Fucking own your shit for once!

1249
01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.846
Okay. it's owned. I'm sorry.

1250
01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.973
Nothing works out
unless you do something. okay?

1251
01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:18.434
That's the basic principle
of fucking life.

1252
01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.727
- Stop!
- Hello!

1253
01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.270
Don't.

1254
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:26.901
Please don't.

1255
01:22:34.075 --> 01:22:36.952
- It's for the best.
- Stop!

1256
01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:44.627
- Oh. my God. Oh. my God. Oh.
- Oh. my God. Casper!

1257
01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:48.381
I'm not gonna do anything. okay?
I won't do anything!

1258
01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:52.176
No. wait! Oh. fuck.

1259
01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.336
Okay. well. that's not really ideal
for either of us.

1260
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:56.030
- Just shut up! Okay?
- What are you doing?

1261
01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:58.173
I don't know what I'm fucking doing.
Applying pressure.

1262
01:22:58.199 --> 01:23:01.327
- That's too much pressure!
- Okay! Shit.

1263
01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:04.230
- Don't worry. It doesn't matter.
- Yes. it fucking matters!

1264
01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:07.191
This isn't too bad.
Maybe this is the now.

1265
01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:10.861
- It feels like the now.
- Stop talking. okay?

1266
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:14.281
We've gotta go. Let's go.

1267
01:23:14.407 --> 01:23:16.951
No. no. No. um...

1268
01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:18.494
Come on. get up. Get up. get up.

1269
01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:22.164
- I can't move my leg.
- Fucking heavy.

1270
01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:26.460
- I know.
- Okay.

1271
01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:29.380
- Let's go. Oh. sh... Fuck!
- I can't walk!

1272
01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:33.175
Fuck. Oh. shut up for a second. okay?

1273
01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:40.474
- I'm from the future.
- I know. I know. Okay. Just...

1274
01:23:49.108 --> 01:23:54.447
But despite that skepticism
from the publishing industry.

1275
01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:59.368
Mr. Sullivan's book
has already gained much notoriety

1276
01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:04.081
for the surprising accuracy
of his predictions.

1277
01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.625
Some online are even calling him

1278
01:24:06.751 --> 01:24:12.131
potentially the most important
political cartoonist in history.

1279
01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:18.387
So I am very proud to present
Mr. Percy Sullivan!

1280
01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:30.566
Hey. Percy.

1281
01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:36.947
I like the scarf.

1282
01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:41.410
Here. This is everything I found
in her condo. Take it.

1283
01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:47.708
All I ask is that I never see you or him
ever again.

1284
01:24:56.342 --> 01:24:59.845
- Thanks. Percy.
- I'm doing my part. you know.

1285
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:04.600
Telling them the truth.
Helping them... with my art.

1286
01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:06.393
Uh-huh.

1287
01:25:06.519 --> 01:25:10.189
You wanna save the world?
Knock yourself out.

1288
01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:21.826
- Ten. nine. eight...
- Here it comes!

1289
01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:24.286
- ...seven. six...
- Five! No?

1290
01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:30.084
- Five. four. three. two. one!
- ...five. four. three. two. one!

1291
01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:32.127
Happy New Year!

1292
01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:35.172
Whoo-hoo!

1293
01:25:35.297 --> 01:25:39.760
Everything's still fine.
I knew it would be.

1294
01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:43.973
- Hey.
- There you are!

1295
01:25:44.098 --> 01:25:47.935
- Hey! Did I miss it?
- You missed it. So close!

1296
01:25:49.562 --> 01:25:51.480
Spoiler alert.
Very similar to last year.

1297
01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:53.524
Just basically counting down from 10.

1298
01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:57.194
- And then they say. "Happy New Year."
- Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1299
01:25:57.653 --> 01:25:59.822
- How's Percy?
- He's okay.

1300
01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:04.201
- He even threw us a copy of his book.
- Oh. wow.

1301
01:26:04.285 --> 01:26:05.411
- Yeah.
- Any good?

1302
01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:07.496
Honestly. it fuckin' sucks. bro.

1303
01:26:07.621 --> 01:26:09.540
- Does it?
- Yeah.

1304
01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:12.626
But it does literally predict the future.

1305
01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:16.380
- So it's got that going for it.
- Well. you can do that yourself now.

1306
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:19.341
Think you got everything you need?
To stop it?

1307
01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:21.135
I don't know.

1308
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.429
She said there's...
there's maybe 120 people

1309
01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:25.214
who could actually change things. right?

1310
01:26:25.239 --> 01:26:27.074
Mmm-hmm.

1311
01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:30.811
- I know where they live.
- Well. look at you!

1312
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:33.647
I feel like I've turned your life around.

1313
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:36.609
Bro. we literally met
while you were eating my garbage.

1314
01:26:36.734 --> 01:26:40.571
That's true. I forgot that. Oh. God.

1315
01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:46.785
Mmm... So. how will we know
if we stopped it? What will happen?

1316
01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:48.996
It will most likely be
some sort of paradox

1317
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.581
that'll swallow reality whole.

1318
01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.542
- Or maybe nothing?
- Yes.

1319
01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:58.547
Maybe nothing will happen.
Yeah. I like the idea of nothing.

1320
01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:05.304
- So... are you sure about this?
- Yeah. I was born to be. mate.

1321
01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:08.974
Oh. God. Yeah. it has to be this way.

1322
01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:12.937
I'll be back from time to time.

1323
01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:22.029
I'll be fine. There's a plan.
I'm from the future. you know.

1324
01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:31.538
I don't know if you'll have
heard of Holly or what she's done.

1325
01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:32.998
but I hope so.

1326
01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.918
It's probably pointless. but she's right.

1327
01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:38.212
it's worth trying for something better.

1328
01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:42.132
I know the future is already written.
but maybe it shouldn't be.

1329
01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:46.929
After all. we rewrite history
all the time. Why not the future?

1330
01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:55.396
Holly! Everyone's here.
The checkpoints are locked.

1331
01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:58.148
The trucks are loaded up.
Everything is in position.

1332
01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:02.778
- What's our next move?
- Let's save the fucking world.

1333
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.399
But if you've got any questions
or concerns. I'm happy to oblige.

1334
01:28:09.535 --> 01:28:11.662
If you're reading this.
you'll know where to find me.

1335
01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:18.502
I'll be right here.

1336
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.966
- Hello?
- Hi! Yeah. hi. Hi.

1337
01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:25.843
Uh. Stasis or Static?

1338
01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:29.471
Stasis or Static?

1339
01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:33.767
- The moment is mine.
- Okay. Perfect. Great. Oh. my God.

1340
01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:37.521
We followed your signal. and we
desperately. desperately need to talk.

1341
01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:39.064
Okay. hang on a sec. buddy.

1342
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.358
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh. my God. Thank you so much.

1343
01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:42.526
Thank you.

1344
01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:47.823
Hello!
