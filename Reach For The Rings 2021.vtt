12

She's actually somebody
I compete with quite often.

14

She moved to my hometown and
she has the same coach as me.

15
00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:40.171

against each other.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.787
We're kind of frenemies.
We're friends but

21
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.317
kind of enemies in a way because
we're both so competitive

22
00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:56.220
and we always kind of
bounce back and forth

23
00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.782
between who's winning events.

24
00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:01.093

- Run! Run! Run!

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.327
The final. final set.

27
00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:07.297
Final five reps

28
00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:10.366
We don't like high-five
before the events.

Finish line is just up here.
let's go.

358
00:17:32.415 --> 00:17:33.579
Come on!

359
00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:38.749
♪

360
00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:44.293
Come on! Come on!

361
00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:47.263
Norway was the first team
to cross the finish line.

362
00:17:47.298 --> 00:17:50.200
Followed closely
by the USA and Canada

363
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:53.269
with Sweden taking
fifth place behind Germany.

364
00:17:57.473 --> 00:17:59.605
- How you doing?
- Good.

365
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.442
I swear. if we could have
got even on that...

366
00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:04.610
That big hill we would have won.

367
00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:06.150
Good start.

368
00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.514
Each of our Test One winners

369
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:10.385
receives an award
for their victory

370
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.290
as well as their first
100 points on the leader board.

371
00:18:14.325 --> 00:18:15.852
Every athlete earned points

372
00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.459
but the highest placing athletes
earn the most

373
00:18:18.494 --> 00:18:21.891
with the lowest placing athletes
earning the least.

374
00:18:21.926 --> 00:18:24.135
I'm not 100 percent sure
how the scoring is done.

375
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.500
I just know that the first
person gets first place

376
00:18:26.535 --> 00:18:29.272
and then as the...

377
00:18:29.307 --> 00:18:31.340
Not first person get 100 points.
first person...

378
00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:33.672
Oh. is that what I said?

379
00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:35.410
First place gets...

380
00:18:35.445 --> 00:18:39.315
- First person gets first place.
- Okay. let's back this up.

381
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.185
As it goes down
they get less and less points

382
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.626
and the person
with the most points

383
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.815
at the end of the weekend
is the winner.

384
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.257
If you finish first you get
100 points and so on and so on.

385
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.688
Each event works on
a 100 point system.

386
00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:51.492
With her win in Test One.

387
00:18:51.527 --> 00:18:54.462
Alex Parker declared herself
a top competitor

388
00:18:54.497 --> 00:18:56.497
and would have
to defend that position

389
00:18:56.532 --> 00:18:58.202
throughout the weekend to come.

390
00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:02.470
I competed in fitness
for about seven years now.

391
00:19:02.505 --> 00:19:03.735
At a pretty high level.

392
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.440
I got into it
right after university

393
00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:07.706
and fell in love
with it instantly

394
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:12.216
and have been doing it...
I've been doing it ever since.

395
00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.251
Her rival. Jordan Adcock.

396
00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.287
was also a capable athlete
who had earned her place

397
00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.816
at the World Championships.

398
00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:21.786
I started towards
the end of 2012

399
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:23.733
and kind of as soon as
I started I knew I wanted

400
00:19:23.757 --> 00:19:26.395
to take the competitive track.
I saw what people

401
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.232
were doing competing
and it was something

402
00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:30.696
that I wanted to strive towards
so since the beginning

403
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:33.963
that's kind of been the track
that I've tried to stay on.

404
00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:36.603
Next up. is the Strength Test.

405
00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:38.374
This test
is the complete opposite

406
00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:40.277
of the Endurance Test.

407
00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.642
Rather than a long.
grueling effort

408
00:19:42.677 --> 00:19:45.216
this is short
and fast and heavy.

409
00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:47.581
Inside of our tests there are
some

410
00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:50.584
deeper characteristics
of each test.

411
00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:53.719
How strength
is expressed inside of our test

412
00:19:53.754 --> 00:19:55.325
is slightly different.

413
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.656
On a continuum of strength

414
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:59.296
there's multiple different kinds
of strength

415
00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:03.234
and we mainly test
what's called strength speed.

416
00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:05.896
And that is.
not the highest loads absolutely

417
00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:07.535
or the highest intensity.

418
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.240
It's close to that.

419
00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:11.869
But we love strength speed
as a physical test

420
00:20:11.904 --> 00:20:13.838
because you need a big base
of absolute strength

421
00:20:13.873 --> 00:20:17.347
to express it and it results
in you being really good

422
00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.679
at coordination and timing.

423
00:20:19.714 --> 00:20:22.715
Load moved
through a range of motion.

424
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.783
For the Individual
Men and Women.

425
00:20:24.818 --> 00:20:27.819
Test Two was
an overhead squat ladder.

426
00:20:27.854 --> 00:20:30.789
The test was performed
in three rounds

427
00:20:30.824 --> 00:20:32.494

428
00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:34.595

In order for their reps to count

432
00:20:39.866 --> 00:20:42.735
the athletes would have to squat
all the way below parallel

433

standing position at the top.

test was entirely different.

675
00:33:32.209 --> 00:33:36.178
Fitness is a sport
for a couple different reasons.

676
00:33:36.213 --> 00:33:38.147
It's measureable.

677
00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:41.051
So if you can have
a number of humans

678
00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:44.054
perform certain tasks
and you have some of them

679
00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:46.584
that are better than others
and you have a measurement

680
00:33:46.619 --> 00:33:49.389
of that task you have a sport.

681
00:33:49.424 --> 00:33:52.557
I used to be a former gymnast
most of my life.

682
00:33:52.592 --> 00:33:55.065
I started out playing soccer and
running track

683
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.233
and then later on I started
doing competitive cheerleading.

684
00:33:58.268 --> 00:34:00.796
I grew up playing rugby union
and surf life saving

685
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:04.173
in Australia so I competed
at a national level.

686
00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:06.835
I was a competitive
Alpine ski racer.

687
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.113
I was on the Canadian
National Ski Team.

688
00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.675
I also play golf and soccer.

689
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.645
So these six different tests
are all things

690
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.121
that people will do
in "fitness" at a gym

691
00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:21.124
but to my point.
our of a thousand people

692
00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.686
that do that one test.

693
00:34:22.721 --> 00:34:25.524
they'll be some that
can do it better than others.

694
00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:27.592
Hence. you now make it a sport.

695
00:34:27.627 --> 00:34:30.298
From the spotting perspective
itself.

696
00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:31.533
what we have done to the sport

697
00:34:31.565 --> 00:34:33.136
is add a little bit
of structure.

698
00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:35.666
So that started
with the rulebook

699
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:37.437
and the movement standards

700
00:34:37.472 --> 00:34:41.705
up until we did it there
was never a book of movements.

701
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.751
A written book of every single
movement in the sport

702
00:34:43.775 --> 00:34:47.546
and how it would be judged.
so we put that together

703
00:34:47.581 --> 00:34:49.581
and that's just on our website

704
00:34:49.616 --> 00:34:53.486
24/7 basically
and if you don't know

705
00:34:53.521 --> 00:34:54.597
how a movement
is gonna be judged

706
00:34:54.621 --> 00:34:56.324
you can go and look at it.

707
00:34:56.359 --> 00:34:59.492
If something is not
in there then you can know

708
00:34:59.527 --> 00:35:01.527
it won't show up
in competition that season.

709
00:35:01.562 --> 00:35:03.496
Why we created the tests.

710
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:05.333
we organized it philosophically

711
00:35:05.368 --> 00:35:07.368
believing that the six tests...

712
00:35:07.403 --> 00:35:09.370
This is important.

713
00:35:09.405 --> 00:35:11.306
would allow the coach
and the athlete

714
00:35:11.341 --> 00:35:14.177
to not only know
what they need to prepare for

715
00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:17.510
but to build a lifetime
of sport opportunity

716
00:35:17.545 --> 00:35:20.777
because the six test are what
we're considering balance.

717
00:35:20.812 --> 00:35:23.747
Every competition
is different workouts

718
00:35:23.782 --> 00:35:27.454
but the workouts
have like a structure.

719
00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:30.754
The structure of the sport
is what separates it

720
00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:33.658
from some of the other
Functional Fitness sports

721
00:35:33.693 --> 00:35:35.374
- that are out there.
- You know going into

722
00:35:35.398 --> 00:35:37.530
a competition that every single
facet of fitness

723
00:35:37.565 --> 00:35:41.204
is gonna be tested because they
have standardized

724
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.239
like formats
for each different workout.

725
00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:46.671
We're essentially focusing
on making the philosophy

726
00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:50.378
of training be balanced.

727
00:35:50.413 --> 00:35:52.809
It allows coaches
and athletes to like grasp

728

onto knowing
what they're training for.

729
00:35:55.385 --> 00:35:57.187
The idea is that
you're well rounded.

730
00:35:57.222 --> 00:35:59.486
You can pick up a heavy weight
when call upon

731

You're fit across all plains.
I mean.

735
00:36:08.563 --> 00:36:10.530
you can run. you can lift.

736
00:36:10.565 --> 00:36:12.466
you can do it under duress.

737
00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:14.831
It really encompasses
everything.

738
00:36:14.866 --> 00:36:18.274
So by having those
it creates some structure.

739
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.672
it becomes a known thing

740
00:36:20.707 --> 00:36:23.279

and a 22 year old

741
00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:25.644

and go.

742
00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:26.975

on the leader board
in this event.

919
00:45:08.938 --> 00:45:10.399
This was to be expected.

920
00:45:10.434 --> 00:45:12.434
Imagine putting
all that weight upside down

921
00:45:12.469 --> 00:45:14.337
onto your arms and shoulders

922
00:45:14.372 --> 00:45:18.209
than using those arms
to pull that weight up a rope.

923
00:45:18.244 --> 00:45:20.915
The boys did solid.

924
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:25.117
Definitely. tall Matt
was in first place overnight.

925
00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:28.054
It was more of
a managed workout for him.

926
00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:30.518
A lot of handstand push ups.
he's six foot four.

927

Zach crushed it but we still got

928
00:45:33.424 --> 00:45:35.457

I think still in the top ten

929

for the Teams.

933
00:45:44.303 --> 00:45:47.073
I think for us.
if we do well on this workout

934
00:45:47.108 --> 00:45:51.011
it gives us a great chance
to podium

935

but we're gonna have to be
really smart.

936
00:45:53.015 --> 00:45:57.413
It's definitely not
Matt's favorite movement.

937
00:45:57.448 --> 00:45:59.789
I'm being nice here...
Handstand pushups have been

938
00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:01.483
his nemesis in the past.

939
00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:03.485
So we've got to manage it well.

The second half of the workout
with Brian and Sam.

941
00:46:05.555 --> 00:46:07.489
we should be pretty strong.

942
00:46:07.524 --> 00:46:10.030
But that first half of the
workout with Matt and Maicey.

943
00:46:10.065 --> 00:46:11.526
Matt's just gotta be
able to hang.

944
00:46:11.561 --> 00:46:14.463
We've gotta split
the reps up smartly.

945
00:46:14.498 --> 00:46:17.169
And hopefully be able
to get it to the second half

946
00:46:17.204 --> 00:46:18.500
of the workout with some time

947
00:46:18.535 --> 00:46:20.403
to be able to make up
some time on it.

948
00:46:20.438 --> 00:46:22.471
But I think it's going to be
a pivotal workout.

949
00:46:22.506 --> 00:46:24.880
A male female pair of athletes

950
00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.949

of the work.

951
00:46:27.984 --> 00:46:29.918

would be alternating

deficit handstand push ups.

953
00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:34.417
Each time their partner
performed a push up

954
00:46:34.452 --> 00:46:36.419
the other athlete
had to hold themselves

955
00:46:36.454 --> 00:46:38.355
in a handstand position.

956
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.061
The deficit
was 20 centimeters for males

957
00:46:41.096 --> 00:46:43.327
and ten centimeters for females.

958
00:46:43.362 --> 00:46:45.263

963

an even greater challenge.

964
00:46:54.208 --> 00:46:56.879
The handstand push up
deficit was now increased

965
00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:58.309

966
00:46:58.344 --> 00:47:00.278
and 20 centimeters for women.

967
00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:03.149
And these rope climbs would
have to be performed legless.

968
00:47:03.184 --> 00:47:06.185
Meaning. the athletes could not
use their feet or legs

969
00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.253
to assist in the climb.

970

The next test
was the Skill test.

This test was similar
to test three

1070
00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:12.326
in that it primarily consisted
of bodyweight movements

1071

a similar timeframe.

1072

this test was about

to perform difficult skills.

1078
00:52:31.446 --> 00:52:33.182

a gymnastics complex
of a bar up and over

to do in the playground

the athletes would all start

1098
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:18.557
with one rep on each each arm
of a kettlebell getup.

1099
00:53:18.592 --> 00:53:21.725
The getup requires an athlete to
hold a weight above their head

1100
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.562
as they lower
all the way to the ground.

to a complex on the pull up bar.

1106
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.004
This complex involved
a series of movements

1107
00:53:37.039 --> 00:53:39.512

their strength and coordination

1108
00:53:39.547 --> 00:53:41.943
as well as balance
and equilibrium.

1109
00:53:41.978 --> 00:53:44.550
Each movement would
have to be performed perfectly

The third part of the test
was a handstand walk.

1113

But what made this handstand
walk different

1114
00:53:53.957 --> 00:53:56.793
was the requirement that
athletes hold a foam block

1115

as well as the requirement

1116

the second event

1271
01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.321
is like a lot
of gymnastics stuff.

1272
01:02:12.356 --> 01:02:15.830

do a bunch of bar muscle-ups.

Between each round
on the pull-up bar.

1283
01:02:43.255 --> 01:02:47.125
athletes took turns performing
15-meter handstand walks.

1284
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.426
This is approximately 50 feet
per athlete each round.

being able to step up
to the challenge

1362
01:07:03.647 --> 01:07:05.614
of literally being called up
at the last minute

1363
01:07:05.649 --> 01:07:08.584
to travel halfway
across the world to exercise

1364
01:07:08.619 --> 01:07:10.586

1365
01:07:10.621 --> 01:07:13.622
While they did not finish
in the top 5 of test 4.

1366
01:07:13.657 --> 01:07:16.394
the USA team's
respectable finish gave them

1367
01:07:16.429 --> 01:07:17.659
enough points to remain

1368
01:07:17.694 --> 01:07:19.232

1369
01:07:19.267 --> 01:07:22.631
going into day 3.

1370
01:07:22.666 --> 01:07:25.172
This is our third
world championships.

1371
01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.174
and it's a great event
every year.

1372
01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:30.111
and it's really starting
to take on. you know.

1373
01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:32.212
some more meaning
within the community

1374
01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:34.445
where it's an honor
to represent your country

1375
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.613
and win a world championship
title for your country.

1376
01:07:37.648 --> 01:07:40.616
I founded the iF3 in 2016.

1377
01:07:40.651 --> 01:07:43.289
I was at a point in my life
professionally

1378
01:07:43.324 --> 01:07:46.094
where I didn't have a job
at the time

1379
01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:48.789
and was having difficulty
finding a new job.

1380
01:07:48.824 --> 01:07:51.627
and I always thought this sport
had so much potential

1381
01:07:51.662 --> 01:07:55.136
to be an Olympic sport
and really be

1382
01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:58.106
a legitimately recognized sport.
and I kind of figured.

1383
01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:00.702
well. I understand generally
what the process is like.

1384
01:08:00.737 --> 01:08:02.374
There are things
from my background

1385
01:08:02.409 --> 01:08:05.245
that just kind of put me
in a good position to do this.

1386
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.444
No one else is doing it.

1387
01:08:06.479 --> 01:08:08.116
I don't see anyone else

1388
01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:10.217
willing to take the risk
at the time.

1389
01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.384
I figured. well.
I might as well go for it

1390
01:08:12.419 --> 01:08:13.781
because I believe in it.

1391
01:08:13.816 --> 01:08:15.387
Incorporated the nonprofit.

1392
01:08:15.422 --> 01:08:17.785
had a very small team to start.

1393
01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.327
and it took about a year
of background work.

1394
01:08:21.362 --> 01:08:25.166
and then we publicly announced
in June of 2017.

1395
01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:29.896
and within four months. we held
our first world championship.

1396
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:32.239
What we've seen historically
in the sport

1397
01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.703
is private brands
running competitions. right?

1398
01:08:34.738 --> 01:08:36.474
Branded events.

1399
01:08:36.509 --> 01:08:39.312
And what we have here
is a nonprofit organization

1400
01:08:39.347 --> 01:08:40.775
governing a sport. right?

1401
01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.414
And the term.
"functional fitness."

1402
01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:45.549
that's a generic name
for the sport.

1403
01:08:45.584 --> 01:08:48.519
A brand. a trademark brand name.
cannot be a sport.

1404
01:08:48.554 --> 01:08:50.158
For purposes
of the Olympic movement.

1405
01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:53.161
that's really important
to kind of know and distinguish.

1406
01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:55.889
and sometimes that gets confused
in our community.

1407
01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:58.826
so we've had to do a lot of
sort of education on that point.

1408
01:08:58.861 --> 01:09:02.269
but we have a board of directors
who governs things

1409
01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.370
and kind of helps run
the organization.

1410
01:09:04.405 --> 01:09:05.701
and then we have committees

1411
01:09:05.736 --> 01:09:08.506
who make a lot
of our specific decisions.

1412
01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:10.574
and really it's people
amongst the community

1413
01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:11.916
who are serving
on these committees

1414
01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.709
and doing this work
to grow the sport.

1415
01:09:13.744 --> 01:09:15.315
So it's a group of people

1416
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.262
helping to manage and develop
and run the sport.

1417
01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.616
It's not like one person
is owning this.

1418
01:09:19.651 --> 01:09:22.454
Yeah. the iF3 is structured
based upon

1419
01:09:22.489 --> 01:09:24.720
just previous experiences
in sport.

1420
01:09:24.755 --> 01:09:27.591
That's what we...
Like if you were to open a book

1421
01:09:27.626 --> 01:09:30.396
and say. "How do you do
sport governance?"

1422
01:09:30.431 --> 01:09:33.630
That has been written
a thousand times over.

1423
01:09:33.665 --> 01:09:36.204
so we're standing
on the shoulders of giants.

1424
01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:39.504
of the pluses and minuses
from all those experiences.

1425
01:09:39.539 --> 01:09:43.706
and what we laid it out at
is like any other sport growth.

1426
01:09:43.741 --> 01:09:47.248
You have to have some structure
from the local level

1427
01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:51.549
all the way up to Olympic level
and have qualification standards

1428
01:09:51.584 --> 01:09:54.354
and like a knowledge
around what the sport looks like

1429
01:09:54.389 --> 01:09:55.883
at each of those levels.

1430
01:09:55.918 --> 01:09:57.984
And if you go global
with a sport.

1431
01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.656
you have to have
the conversation

1432
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:00.833
around how sport is expressed

1433
01:10:00.857 --> 01:10:02.494
at the highest level
for that globe.

1434
01:10:02.529 --> 01:10:03.462
That's the Olympics.

1435
01:10:03.497 --> 01:10:06.267
Our campaign is called
Reach for the Rings.

1436
01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:08.863
which sort of has
a dual meaning.

1437
01:10:08.898 --> 01:10:10.799
I guess
the more literal meaning being

1438
01:10:10.834 --> 01:10:12.504
reaching for the Olympic rings.

1439
01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:15.771
that we're trying to live
that Olympic dream.

1440
01:10:15.806 --> 01:10:18.939
and then
a more fitness-esque meaning

1441
01:10:18.974 --> 01:10:21.711
with the idea
of reaching for the rings.

1442
01:10:21.746 --> 01:10:25.748
visualizing the gymnastics rings
hanging down from the ceiling

1443
01:10:25.783 --> 01:10:27.981
and people jumping up
to do. say. muscle-ups.

1444
01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:30.258
Right. you have to reach up
for those rings.

1445
01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.600
People tend
to stand there. right?

1446
01:10:31.624 --> 01:10:32.887
They stand there and they wait

1447
01:10:32.922 --> 01:10:34.592
and they say.
"I'm not ready yet."

1448
01:10:34.627 --> 01:10:36.506
and then they wait.
they get a couple more breaths.

1449
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:38.365
and then they jump up
to the rings.

1450
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.806
And our philosophy
has kind of been.

1451
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:40.841
"Well. don't wait. just go."

1452
01:10:40.865 --> 01:10:43.304
Right. go before you're ready.
in a sense.

1453
01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.712
or go before you think
you're ready.

1454
01:10:44.736 --> 01:10:46.802
'cause you're never gonna be
totally ready.

1455
01:10:46.837 --> 01:10:48.738
And if you wait.
you probably waited too long.

1456
01:10:48.773 --> 01:10:51.708
This is new territory
for our sport.

1457
01:10:51.743 --> 01:10:54.282
for our federations.
you know. for everybody.

1458
01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:57.417
and we can't be afraid to just
reach for the rings and go.

1459
01:10:57.452 --> 01:10:59.716
Between launching
in June of 2017

1460
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:02.719
and then worlds
in October of that year.

1461
01:11:02.754 --> 01:11:05.788
we had eight federations form
and then show up at worlds.

1462
01:11:05.823 --> 01:11:07.427
which was super awesome.

1463
01:11:07.462 --> 01:11:10.496
And then next year.
we took worlds to London.

1464
01:11:10.531 --> 01:11:11.794
and at that point.

1465
01:11:11.829 --> 01:11:14.962
we had 24 federations
in our organization

1466
01:11:14.997 --> 01:11:18.702
and I think 14 of them
came to worlds.

1467
01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:20.539
Then this year.
now we are in Sweden

1468
01:11:20.574 --> 01:11:21.881
and we've taken another step up.

1469
01:11:21.905 --> 01:11:24.444
We're at 35
national federations.

1470
01:11:24.479 --> 01:11:27.040
and I don't have the total count
of how many are here yet.

1471
01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:28.580
but I think it's over 20.

1472
01:11:28.615 --> 01:11:30.978
- The Swe3F.
- Canada Functional Fitness.

1473
01:11:31.013 --> 01:11:32.881
The Australian
Functional Fitness Federation.

1474
01:11:32.916 --> 01:11:34.751
German Functional Fitness
Federation.

1475
01:11:34.786 --> 01:11:37.017
The F3 Federation for Aruba.

1476
01:11:37.052 --> 01:11:39.558
Russia National Federation.

1477
01:11:39.593 --> 01:11:42.429
Hellenic Functional Fitness
Federation.

1478
01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:45.597
The Norwegian Federation
for Functional Fitness.

1479
01:11:45.632 --> 01:11:48.897
VENEFFIT is the organization

1480
01:11:48.932 --> 01:11:52.373
for the functional fitness
sport in Venezuela.

1481
01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.804
We don't have to go beg people
to start federations.

1482
01:11:54.839 --> 01:11:56.344
They kinda come to us.

1483
01:11:56.379 --> 01:11:57.851
So people will reach out
and they'll say.

1484
01:11:57.875 --> 01:11:58.841
"Hey. I've heard about this.

1485
01:11:58.876 --> 01:12:00.722
I think this is
a great direction for the sport.

1486
01:12:00.746 --> 01:12:02.449
How do I get involved
in my country?

1487
01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:03.956
How do I start a federation?
What do I have to do?"

1488
01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:08.488
And that organic growth
is really important.

1489
01:12:08.523 --> 01:12:11.084
and also I think it makes for
stronger national federations

1490
01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:13.053
because you have people
who are saying.

1491
01:12:13.088 --> 01:12:15.121
"I want to do this
because I care about the sport."

1492
01:12:15.156 --> 01:12:18.564
So. national federations
kind of do what we do

1493
01:12:18.599 --> 01:12:21.534
as an international federation
but on a national level.

1494
01:12:21.569 --> 01:12:22.931
They work to get recognized

1495
01:12:22.966 --> 01:12:25.373
by their various
ministries of sport

1496
01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:27.045
and then their national
Olympic committees.

1497
01:12:27.069 --> 01:12:29.707
They're also all
nonprofit organizations.

1498
01:12:29.742 --> 01:12:31.478
and there can only be one
per country.

1499
01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.843
So we recognize one
in every country.

1500
01:12:33.878 --> 01:12:36.780
and their job is to promote and
grow the sport in their country.

1501
01:12:36.815 --> 01:12:39.453
So it's been 15 years now.
I guess you can say.

1502
01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:42.588
that I've been inside the sport
as a coach and athlete.

1503
01:12:42.623 --> 01:12:46.724
I've coached thousands
of athletes inside this sport.

1504
01:12:46.759 --> 01:12:48.627
I've coached hundreds. now.

1505
01:12:48.662 --> 01:12:51.091
of coaches who are coaching
inside the sport.

1506
01:12:51.126 --> 01:12:53.863
I participated at the highest
level in fitness and won.

1507
01:12:53.898 --> 01:12:56.162
and then I went on
to keep trying to help others

1508
01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:58.703
and different athletes
express that.

1509
01:12:58.738 --> 01:13:00.639
I would say that
I've probably been

1510
01:13:00.674 --> 01:13:03.477
some of those individuals...
One of those individuals

1511
01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:06.942
that took our sport
to a really serious.

1512
01:13:06.977 --> 01:13:09.043
maximal potential personally.

1513
01:13:09.078 --> 01:13:11.452
So it allows me to have
a lot of experience

1514
01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.620
to see what's best
for the growth of this sport

1515
01:13:14.655 --> 01:13:16.556
when we want to structure it
and govern it.

1516
01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:20.758
We can't lose sight
of my past in the sport.

1517
01:13:20.793 --> 01:13:22.793
and it makes me emotional
to think

1518
01:13:22.828 --> 01:13:26.698
that I'll have a part to play
in fixing it.

1519
01:13:26.733 --> 01:13:30.471
It feels like I'm rewriting
something that I was a part of

1520
01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.440
that sent it
in the wrong direction.

1521
01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:35.641
and now I really feel like I
need to bring it back to center

1522
01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:37.643

and nothing else after that.

1566
01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.850
This is the day we crown
our world champions.

1567
01:15:58.885 --> 01:16:00.621
We got our final two tests
today.

1568
01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.029
The first one
is a little different.

1569
01:16:02.053 --> 01:16:04.218
Like the bodyweight test
and the skill test.

1570
01:16:04.253 --> 01:16:06.319
the mixed test this year
also falls

1571
01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:08.695
into the 12-to 15-minute range.

1572
01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.895
Not as long as
the endurance test

1573
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:13.161
but still measuring
an element of work capacity

1574
01:16:13.196 --> 01:16:15.130
and muscular endurance.

1575
01:16:15.165 --> 01:16:17.671
Test 5 was probably
the most popular

1576
01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.036
and beloved test
in the competition.

1577
01:16:20.071 --> 01:16:22.335
combining the elements
of all the other tests

1578
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:26.207
in a very exciting way.
and today. there was a twist.

1579
01:16:26.242 --> 01:16:28.286
I've been calling it
a choose-your-own-adventure test

1580
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:30.882
but they all have the same
buy-in that they have to do.

1581
01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:32.757
They're all biking
and then doing toes-to-bar.

1582
01:16:32.787 --> 01:16:34.259
and then there are
four other movements.

1583
01:16:34.283 --> 01:16:36.723
they have to do 50 reps
of each one.

1584
01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.901
but they got to pick what order
they wanted to do that.

1585
01:16:38.925 --> 01:16:42.289
so it was cool to see
everybody's order of operations.

1586
01:16:42.324 --> 01:16:45.358
so to speak. and see which ones
turned out to be the best.

1587
01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:46.359
After buying in

1588
01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:47.394

1590

1591
01:16:50.299 --> 01:16:51.672
the athletes were allowed

1592
01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:52.904
to choose the order

1593
01:16:52.939 --> 01:16:54.334
of their final four movements.

1594
01:16:54.369 --> 01:16:56.677
Pistols are one-legged squats.

1595
01:16:56.712 --> 01:17:00.648
in this case. alternating legs
on each repetition.

1596
01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:03.178
Single-arm dumbbell
shoulder-to-overhead

1597
01:17:03.213 --> 01:17:04.817

1598
01:17:04.852 --> 01:17:07.380
for throwing a weight
up in the air in one hand.

1599
01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:10.152
The Russian kettlebell swing
is an exercise

1600
01:17:10.187 --> 01:17:12.055

uses their hips

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:14.090

to above their shoulder height.

01:23:34.637 --> 01:23:37.671
Well. this is my seventh year of
competing in functional fitness.

1733
01:23:37.706 --> 01:23:40.377
first time though competing
at the iF3.

1734
01:23:40.412 --> 01:23:42.709
I like the idea of branching out

1735
01:23:42.744 --> 01:23:45.646
in all the different functional
fitness sporting opportunities

1736
01:23:45.681 --> 01:23:47.582
that are popping up now.
and I really wanted

1737
01:23:47.617 --> 01:23:49.749
to kind of come.
check it out for myself.

1738
01:23:49.784 --> 01:23:53.291
and hopefully help build it
in Australia

1739
01:23:53.326 --> 01:23:55.788
as a different avenue of
competing in functional fitness.

1740
01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:57.724
Teams test 5 was also known

1741
01:23:57.759 --> 01:23:59.429
as the strategy test.

1742
01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:01.200
Teams would have to strategize

1743
01:24:01.235 --> 01:24:03.235
how they wanted
to attack this test

1744
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:07.536
by selecting one athlete to
perform each of the four tasks.

1745
01:24:07.571 --> 01:24:09.340
Men would do the first two tasks

1746
01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:11.771
with women completing
the final two.

1747
01:24:11.806 --> 01:24:14.708
In the team test.
you are able to cater

1748
01:24:14.743 --> 01:24:16.380
to your strengths a little bit.

1749
01:24:16.415 --> 01:24:18.712
So for me. unfortunately for me.

1750
01:24:18.747 --> 01:24:20.384
my strengths are my engine.

1751
01:24:20.419 --> 01:24:22.650
so all the uncomfortable.
nasty...

1752
01:24:22.685 --> 01:24:25.422
Distance running at top speed.

1753
01:24:25.457 --> 01:24:27.853
cycling. you know.
squat snatches.

1754
01:24:27.888 --> 01:24:29.657
And then I think our last test

1755
01:24:29.692 --> 01:24:31.197
of the competition will be

1756
01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:32.792
an 80-calorie Assault Bike.

1757
01:24:32.827 --> 01:24:34.761
which is a mean test.

1758
01:24:34.796 --> 01:24:36.862
Go!

1759
01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:41.735

all 100 wall-balls.

One hundred wall-balls.

They are holding on.

1766

on these 100 wall-balls.

1767
01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:08.399
Look out for the judge's hand.

1768
01:25:08.434 --> 01:25:11.468
When that hand comes up.
it's only five reps to go.

athletes' nerves were tense

as they strategized
how to approach the shortest

1863

of the six tests.

1864

The first time I did it. I...

1865
01:29:44.138 --> 01:29:46.578

thrusters before that

1866

1867

The last time I did. like...

1873

before. but I just had like

1874
01:30:05.962 --> 01:30:08.435
multiple sets
of like 20-cals. 20 burpees.

1875

between 1500 and 1600

for the last like 5 calories

exactly what it says it is:

01:30:28.688 --> 01:30:32.789
really nasty. painful.
short-duration power.

1884
01:30:32.824 --> 01:30:35.121
This test represents
the latest development

1885

1891
01:30:50.171 --> 01:30:51.544

1892
01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:53.073
three elements performed

01:30:59.752 --> 01:31:01.983

1897

It's one of those events
that. the shorter it is.

1902

so. you know.

1903
01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:17.636

close those eyes.

1904

2077
01:39:18.481 --> 01:39:20.052
in heat 2.

2078
01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:22.087
Go!

2079
01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:26.190
It is an open spot
for the bronze medal today.

2080
01:39:26.225 --> 01:39:29.556
Those teams who has the chance
to take the bronze medal.

2081
01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:33.494
In this heat.
it is Sweden and Brazil.

2082
01:39:33.529 --> 01:39:39.533
And in the upcoming heat.
it is United States and Russia.

2083
01:39:39.568 --> 01:39:43.636
The team getting the best score
of those four

2084
01:39:43.671 --> 01:39:46.210
will take
the bronze medal today.

2085
01:39:46.245 --> 01:39:50.379
Final reps for Sweden on lane 3.

2086
01:39:50.414 --> 01:39:54.119
And it is Sweden taking
the lead in this heat!

2087
01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:56.616
Back on the rower
for the second time.

2088
01:39:56.651 --> 01:40:00.389
And it is Sweden
back on the floor in the lead.

2089
01:40:00.424 --> 01:40:04.657
Final 15 worm thrusters
for Sweden.

2090
01:40:04.692 --> 01:40:08.298
Sweden. who has the chance
to take the bronze medal today.

2091
01:40:08.333 --> 01:40:11.334
but they also need to be quicker
than the United States

2092
01:40:11.369 --> 01:40:13.435
and Russia in the next heat.

2093
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:15.371
So they need to pick up
the pace.

2094
01:40:15.406 --> 01:40:17.670
Final reps for Sweden.

2095
01:40:17.705 --> 01:40:20.673
And they are done.
and finished for Sweden.

2096
01:40:20.708 --> 01:40:24.578
taking this heat win.

2097
01:40:24.613 --> 01:40:27.416
If Russia or the USA
could beat this time

2098
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:28.483
in the next heat.

2099
01:40:28.518 --> 01:40:29.550
they'd knock Sweden

2100
01:40:29.585 --> 01:40:31.123
off that podium position

2101
01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:32.322
and claim the bronze

2102
01:40:32.357 --> 01:40:33.323
for themselves.

2103
01:40:33.358 --> 01:40:34.555
Go!

2104
01:40:36.658 --> 01:40:40.528
It is the final heat
of the final test

2105
01:40:40.563 --> 01:40:42.332
of this whole weekend.

2106
01:40:42.367 --> 01:40:45.203
And going in today.
we had Russia on third place.

2107
01:40:45.238 --> 01:40:49.339
but it's an open spot
for the third place right now.

2108
01:40:49.374 --> 01:40:53.475
Is it gonna be Sweden.
Russia. or United States

2109
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:55.543

And there we have
a finish for Canada.

2143
01:42:52.992 --> 01:42:56.532
taking third place in this heat.

2144
01:42:56.567 --> 01:43:01.768
And we have two more to go
for Russia on lane 2.

2145
01:43:01.803 --> 01:43:03.506
♪

2146
01:43:03.541 --> 01:43:05.706
And they are done.

2147
01:43:05.741 --> 01:43:08.709
and finished for Russia.

2148
01:43:10.911 --> 01:43:14.979
The USA came across
a mere 19 seconds behind Norway.

2149
01:43:15.014 --> 01:43:18.884
but in this short test.
19 seconds was a lot.

2150
01:43:18.919 --> 01:43:21.326
While they were pleased
with their performance.

2151
01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:25.330
they didn't realize it was
13 seconds slower than Sweden.

2152
01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:27.794
enough to put them
in third place in this test

2153
01:43:27.829 --> 01:43:29.796
and dash their hopes
of the podium.

2154
01:43:29.831 --> 01:43:31.732
Canada finished next.

2155
01:43:31.767 --> 01:43:33.338
coming in 18 seconds

2156
01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:34.768
behind the USA.

2157
01:43:34.803 --> 01:43:36.374
This put them in fifth place

2158
01:43:36.409 --> 01:43:37.771
for the test. but because

2159
01:43:37.806 --> 01:43:39.278
of their superior performance

2160
01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:40.313
in the previous tests

2161
01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:41.347
of the weekend.

2162
01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:43.315
their silver medal podium spot

2163
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:44.382
was secure.

2164
01:43:44.417 --> 01:43:46.318
It is time

2165
01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:49.981
to see who are
the world champions. 2019.

2166
01:43:50.016 --> 01:43:52.588
In the final standings.
it was Canada's Alex Parker

2167
01:43:52.623 --> 01:43:57.659
who took the win with 570
out of 600 possible points.

2168
01:44:03.964 --> 01:44:06.437
Taking first place
in three events

2169
01:44:06.472 --> 01:44:08.604
and second place in two others.

2170
01:44:08.639 --> 01:44:12.608
she was essentially untouchable
over the entire weekend.

2171
01:44:12.643 --> 01:44:14.313
It was a good weekend.
I kinda came in

2172
01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:15.809
with no expectations

2173
01:44:15.844 --> 01:44:17.448
because I had no idea who I was

2174
01:44:17.483 --> 01:44:18.682
gonna be competing against.

2175
01:44:18.718 --> 01:44:22.387
I knew some of the U.S. team
and some of the Canadian team.

2176
01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:23.630
I've competed
against them before.

2177
01:44:23.654 --> 01:44:25.291
but I didn't know
who was gonna be here

2178
01:44:25.326 --> 01:44:29.526
from other countries
like Sweden or Norway.

2179
01:44:29.561 --> 01:44:32.595
so I just kinda went in
just trying to do

2180
01:44:32.630 --> 01:44:34.432
as best as I could
in each event.

2181
01:44:34.467 --> 01:44:38.029
and I did that. so I ended up
getting first place.

2182
01:44:38.064 --> 01:44:41.373
which was... which I'm happy with.

2183
01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.001
Joining Parker on the podium

2184
01:44:43.036 --> 01:44:46.070
were her rival. Jordan Adcock.
in second place.

2185
01:44:46.105 --> 01:44:49.348
as well as Norway's
Matilde Garnes in third.

2186
01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:50.580
She edged me out

2187
01:44:50.615 --> 01:44:51.812
for the majority

2188
01:44:51.847 --> 01:44:53.011
of the events. I would say.

2189
01:44:53.046 --> 01:44:54.386
but it was kinda back and forth.

2190
01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:55.387
back and forth.

2191
01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:56.288
throughout each event.

2192
01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:58.621
So overall I ended up finishing
in second.

2193
01:44:58.656 --> 01:45:00.051
Pleased with that.
but of course.

2194
01:45:00.086 --> 01:45:02.053
always wanting to get
to that top spot.

2195
01:45:02.088 --> 01:45:04.561
While all three
of the U.S. men's competitors

2196
01:45:04.596 --> 01:45:06.398
made a strong showing
over the weekend.

2197
01:45:06.433 --> 01:45:10.061
it was Zach Sowder
who pulled off the victory.

2198
01:45:16.102 --> 01:45:17.068
It feels good to win.

2199
01:45:17.103 --> 01:45:18.971
It was just really stressful.

2200
01:45:19.006 --> 01:45:20.643
It was very fun and exciting.

2201
01:45:20.678 --> 01:45:22.480
but like. it's almost like.

2202
01:45:22.515 --> 01:45:24.779
glad that's over. it's a relief.

2203
01:45:24.814 --> 01:45:25.958
You kinda sit there and like.

2204
01:45:25.982 --> 01:45:28.816
you're in a little bit
of like pain from the workout.

2205
01:45:28.851 --> 01:45:31.423
but you're just like
just sweating. breathing hard.

2206
01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:34.657
and like. man. I'm glad
it happened how it happened.

2207
01:45:34.692 --> 01:45:37.693
There was two points
separating me and Khan Porter

2208
01:45:37.728 --> 01:45:40.058
for first place.
and so it was like

2209
01:45:40.093 --> 01:45:42.797
literally whoever won out of us
would win the competition.

2210
01:45:42.832 --> 01:45:46.438
and the workout literally was
a minute and like 50 seconds.

2211
01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:49.100
So just all-out. empty the tank.

2212
01:45:49.135 --> 01:45:50.970
hold nothing back.
see what happens.

2213
01:45:51.005 --> 01:45:53.940
So we both did that and finished
like maybe five seconds apart.

2214
01:45:53.975 --> 01:45:57.482
but I was able to edge him out
and take the victory.

2215
01:45:57.517 --> 01:46:00.078
Last year I came into this thing
and I was like hoping.

2216
01:46:00.113 --> 01:46:01.816
if everything went right.
I would win.

2217
01:46:01.851 --> 01:46:03.719
but I came off
with like a fifth-place finish.

2218
01:46:03.754 --> 01:46:06.656
So. kind of all year.
I've been ready for this event

2219
01:46:06.691 --> 01:46:08.625
to kinda get
a little bit of redemption.

2220
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.891
so it was nice
to come back and do it.

2221
01:46:10.926 --> 01:46:14.125
While Matt Dlugos and Zach Watts
didn't make the podium.

2222
01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.633
they made a strong showing
at this year's Worlds

2223
01:46:16.668 --> 01:46:18.602
and they'd be back again
in the future

2224
01:46:18.637 --> 01:46:20.131
to give it another shot.

2225
01:46:20.166 --> 01:46:22.001
♪

2226
01:46:22.036 --> 01:46:24.003
Sowder was joined on the podium

2227
01:46:24.038 --> 01:46:27.842
by Latvia's Uldis Upenieks
and Khan Porter from Australia.

2228
01:46:27.877 --> 01:46:29.580
I took second place overall.

2229
01:46:29.615 --> 01:46:30.581
which was.

2230
01:46:30.616 --> 01:46:31.912
yeah. really. really...

2231
01:46:31.947 --> 01:46:33.595
Something I was really.
really pumped about.

2232
01:46:33.619 --> 01:46:35.685
bit surprised about.
if I'm being completely honest.

2233
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:38.688
I think that the leaderboard
changed a hell of a lot

2234
01:46:38.723 --> 01:46:39.887
all throughout the weekend.

2235
01:46:39.922 --> 01:46:41.922
I think I sorta sat...

2236
01:46:41.957 --> 01:46:44.562
I think the lowest I sat
was around fourth.

2237
01:46:44.597 --> 01:46:47.092
I think I was in third
most of the weekend.

2238
01:46:47.127 --> 01:46:48.929
sorta sitting around
that third-place mark.

2239
01:46:48.964 --> 01:46:50.469
and then it was
only this morning

2240
01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:51.800
that I moved up into second.

2241
01:46:51.835 --> 01:46:53.835
There were a bunch of guys
that were in the mix

2242
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:55.100
for quite some time.

2243
01:46:55.135 --> 01:46:57.575
With their first-place finish
in test 6.

2244
01:46:57.610 --> 01:46:59.643
the Norwegians sealed the deal.

2245
01:46:59.678 --> 01:47:01.546
Four first-place finishes.

2246
01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:03.614
one second. and one fifth

2247
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:06.650
had them at 537 total points.

2248
01:47:06.685 --> 01:47:08.916
more than 150 points ahead

2249
01:47:08.951 --> 01:47:11.083
of the second-place team.

2250
01:47:11.118 --> 01:47:13.492
And in Norway's team.

2251
01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:17.562
we have Ingrid Hodnemyr.
Lena Amalia Richter.

2252
01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:22.699
Morten Rasch Arnesen.
and Sigleif Myklebust Ravnestad.

2253
01:47:24.901 --> 01:47:26.934
The Canadians joined them
on the podium

2254
01:47:26.969 --> 01:47:28.705
with 380 points.

2255
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.608
And from Canada. we have

2256
01:47:30.643 --> 01:47:32.973
Jake Hansen. Lynsey Martin.

2257
01:47:33.008 --> 01:47:37.681
Ryan Tomiyama.
and Shaundra Bruvall.

2258
01:47:37.716 --> 01:47:39.881
Sweden took
the third-place position.

2259
01:47:39.916 --> 01:47:41.113
edging out the USA

2260
01:47:41.148 --> 01:47:42.950
by a mere five points.

2261
01:47:42.985 --> 01:47:44.622
And Sweden's team is

2262
01:47:44.657 --> 01:47:46.085
Angelica Bengtsson.

2263
01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.218
Charlie Karlsson.

2264
01:47:47.253 --> 01:47:49.055
.

2265
01:47:49.090 --> 01:47:51.629
Zanna Björnson.

2266
01:47:51.664 --> 01:47:55.127
Despite the historic dominance
of Americans in this sport.

2267
01:47:55.162 --> 01:47:57.096
the Scandinavian teams
had exerted

2268
01:47:57.131 --> 01:48:00.869
their home-team advantage
this year and ruled the weekend.

2269
01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.515
It was obviously
a successful weekend.

2270
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:11.242
I think we left
a few medals out there.

2271
01:48:11.277 --> 01:48:14.278
but it's something
to work forward... work towards

2272
01:48:14.313 --> 01:48:17.050
in the future. and I'm excited
to be a part of it.

2273
01:48:17.085 --> 01:48:21.219
On the women's side.
we had Jordan Adcock.

2274
01:48:21.254 --> 01:48:23.925
who is... she's a heck
of an athlete.

2275
01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:27.060
I think she's only gonna get
better. she's very young.

2276
01:48:27.095 --> 01:48:29.700
She finishes with a silver medal

2277
01:48:29.735 --> 01:48:30.965
and very proud of her.

2278
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.066
She was fantastic all weekend.

2279
01:48:33.101 --> 01:48:35.233
Really pushed for that gold

2280
01:48:35.268 --> 01:48:37.301
and just came up
a little bit short.

2281
01:48:37.336 --> 01:48:40.645
It was a great competition
on the men's side.

2282
01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:43.813
All three of our male
individuals were fantastic.

2283
01:48:43.848 --> 01:48:47.047
Matt Dlugos finished fourth.

2284
01:48:47.082 --> 01:48:49.247
but honestly. he was fantastic.

2285
01:48:49.282 --> 01:48:52.756
He was our national champion.

2286
01:48:52.791 --> 01:48:54.087
He's also 6'4".

2287
01:48:54.122 --> 01:48:57.860
and a few of the tests here

2288
01:48:57.895 --> 01:49:01.930
were very challenging
for a guy his size.

2289
01:49:01.965 --> 01:49:04.229
and he really performed
phenomenally

2290
01:49:04.264 --> 01:49:06.165
against world-class competition.

2291
01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.739
And Zach Watts. who's. you know.

2292
01:49:08.774 --> 01:49:10.048
just a young buck. man. he's got

2293
01:49:10.072 --> 01:49:11.203
all the talent in the world.

2294
01:49:11.238 --> 01:49:12.644
he's just gonna get better.

2295
01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:14.239
and he also had a top-10 finish.

2296
01:49:14.274 --> 01:49:15.878
so really. really happy

2297
01:49:15.913 --> 01:49:16.879
about how

2298
01:49:16.914 --> 01:49:18.617
the individual males competed.

2299
01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:22.082
The team this year
was a little bit of a mixed bag.

2300
01:49:22.117 --> 01:49:24.590
I think we were sitting
in second after day 1.

2301
01:49:24.625 --> 01:49:27.659
just a few points off
out of the gold medal spot.

2302
01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:28.759
and then yesterday.

2303
01:49:28.794 --> 01:49:29.760
unfortunately.

2304
01:49:29.795 --> 01:49:31.894
the bodyweight tests

2305
01:49:31.929 --> 01:49:33.357
were a big challenge.

2306
01:49:33.392 --> 01:49:34.963
and today we had to fight

2307
01:49:34.998 --> 01:49:37.669
our way back. and we almost did.

2308
01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:38.934
We finished in fourth.

2309
01:49:38.969 --> 01:49:40.672
We finished. I believe.

2310
01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:42.135
five points off the podium.

2311
01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:44.907
You know. I'm a sucker
for team competitions.

2312
01:49:44.942 --> 01:49:46.744
so that one hurts
a little bit. honestly.

2313
01:49:46.779 --> 01:49:48.108
I don't think the United States

2314
01:49:48.143 --> 01:49:50.341
should ever finish fourth
in a competition.

2315
01:49:50.376 --> 01:49:51.749
It's unacceptable.

2316
01:49:51.784 --> 01:49:53.652
So I blame myself for that.

2317
01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:55.852
and I think we've just got
to get better.

2318
01:49:55.887 --> 01:49:59.218
We've gotta work harder
and next year come back.

2319
01:49:59.253 --> 01:50:02.287
but it's unacceptable
to finish off the podium

2320
01:50:02.322 --> 01:50:03.322
for the United States.

2321
01:50:03.356 --> 01:50:04.861
We've got too good athletes.

2322
01:50:04.896 --> 01:50:07.897
and so. for next year.

2323
01:50:07.932 --> 01:50:09.965
it's just something to push for.

2324
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.804
We have one more award tonight.

2325
01:50:13.839 --> 01:50:18.237
and that award goes
to our best nation:

2326
01:50:18.272 --> 01:50:20.371
United States!

2327
01:50:23.244 --> 01:50:24.980
In the final standings.

2328
01:50:25.015 --> 01:50:28.214
we had one male individual
on the podium

2329
01:50:28.249 --> 01:50:30.051
who finished with a gold medal.

2330
01:50:30.086 --> 01:50:34.418
we had one female who finished
with a silver medal.

2331
01:50:34.453 --> 01:50:37.190
and the team finished
in fourth place.

2332
01:50:37.225 --> 01:50:40.061
So overall. we had
two overall medals.

2333
01:50:40.096 --> 01:50:43.427
but I believe because we had
two fourth-place finishers

2334
01:50:43.462 --> 01:50:46.331
on the male individual side
and the team side.

2335
01:50:46.366 --> 01:50:49.367
that that pushed us
to the forefront

2336
01:50:49.402 --> 01:50:51.908
as far as the lead nation
with medals.

2337
01:50:51.943 --> 01:50:53.041
I believe we tied Canada.

2338
01:50:53.076 --> 01:50:56.407
but because we had
better finishes.

2339
01:50:56.442 --> 01:50:59.344
that we ended up
as the top nation overall.

2340
01:50:59.379 --> 01:51:01.687
which is obviously great.
I'm very proud of that.

2341
01:51:01.722 --> 01:51:05.053
and hopefully we can continue
that for years to come.

2342
01:51:05.088 --> 01:51:07.924
It's really cool. like.
we were talking earlier.

2343
01:51:07.959 --> 01:51:10.762
like. it's cool to compete
and win for yourself.

2344
01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:13.930
but like. all weekend.
I've been wearing that USA shirt

2345
01:51:13.965 --> 01:51:16.097
and we traveled together.
rooting on each other.

2346
01:51:16.132 --> 01:51:18.462
so you really...
It's bigger than yourself.

2347
01:51:18.497 --> 01:51:22.004
We got that gold medal.
so it means a lot more

2348
01:51:22.039 --> 01:51:23.973
than just going
to a random competition

2349
01:51:24.008 --> 01:51:25.777
and then winning it
for yourself.

2350
01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:28.373
So. yeah. hopefully just
every year I'm competing

2351
01:51:28.408 --> 01:51:31.376
in fitness. this will be one
that's on the calendar for sure.

2352
01:51:31.411 --> 01:51:37.987
It's cool that I won the Worlds
in a growing sport.

2353
01:51:38.022 --> 01:51:42.222
I like to support sport
in all ways.

2354
01:51:42.257 --> 01:51:46.127
and. like. coming in first

2355
01:51:46.162 --> 01:51:50.494
makes the weekend better than
it could've been. so it's good.

2356
01:51:50.529 --> 01:51:54.201
I care a lot about the growth
of an athlete

2357
01:51:54.236 --> 01:51:56.401
and a coach in this sport.

2358
01:51:56.436 --> 01:52:00.746
and that's one of the biggest
emotional pushers for me

2359
01:52:00.781 --> 01:52:05.047
is to have a place and a home
for these coaches to grow

2360
01:52:05.082 --> 01:52:08.050
and for these athletes
to attach to

2361
01:52:08.085 --> 01:52:11.922
and be really excited
about. you know.

2362
01:52:11.957 --> 01:52:17.059
things like wearing
the Olympic country jacket.

2363
01:52:17.094 --> 01:52:19.193
You know.
that gives me goosebumps.

2364
01:52:19.228 --> 01:52:24.033
We've seen tons of growth
very quickly.

2365
01:52:24.068 --> 01:52:27.234
I think probably beyond
anything I would've expected

2366
01:52:27.269 --> 01:52:29.775
back in 2016 when I started.

2367
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:32.173
Everybody's in it
for the right reasons.

2368
01:52:32.208 --> 01:52:33.779
They want to grow the sport.

2369
01:52:33.814 --> 01:52:35.385
they want to make it better
for the athletes.

2370
01:52:35.409 --> 01:52:37.948
they want to make it better
for the coaches and. you know.

2371
01:52:37.983 --> 01:52:40.379
the officials on the floor.

2372
01:52:40.414 --> 01:52:42.150
Nobody's here because they think

2373
01:52:42.185 --> 01:52:44.383
they're gonna become rich
doing this.

2374
01:52:44.418 --> 01:52:46.484
Everybody is here
because they genuinely care

2375
01:52:46.519 --> 01:52:49.454
about the sport
and they want to do...

2376
01:52:49.489 --> 01:52:51.456
They want to see it succeed
and grow

2377
01:52:51.491 --> 01:52:54.030
and be around
for a really long time.
