00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.291
Captain Riva. Welcome back.

4
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.458
So. how are you?

5
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.875
You have to increase my
dosage.

6
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.958
- Captain Riva...
- Leonida.

7
00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:49.500
Leonida.

8
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:54.041
I can go on dosing you up
with drugs

9
00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.125
until you forget your own name.

10
00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.000
Or we can try to come up
with something else.

11
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:03.041
Otherwise. it will be impossible
for me to help you.

12
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:07.500
If you want to help me.
increase the dosage.

13
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:22.166
They invited me to Saturday’s
match.

14
00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:28.000
- Is your son playing?
- No...

15
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.083
Teresa. the little one.

16
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:36.833
The kids will come over
for dinner afterwards. so...

17
00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:39.791
I don't want to...

18
00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:46.000
I want to stay calm while I am
with them.

19
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.250
There's a support group
tomorrow at 11:00.

20
00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:13.291
Talking to someone can help
you.

21
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.708
You could try at least...

22
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.458
Maybe on Saturday. with your
wife...

23
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:23.875
Do I tell her about 30 years
of military missions. at the
match?

24
00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.375
<i>Not more than one every eight</i>
<i>hours.</i>

25
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:37.125
<i>And come back next week.</i>

26
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:40.583
<i>so we will understand</i>
<i>if we need to make adjustments.</i>

27
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:30.333
THE BEAST

28
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.916
Easy!

29
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.291
Go!

30
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:53.458
Watch out!

31
00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:57.458
Ref! That's a high tackle!

32
00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.041
Teresa is getting good.

33
00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.875
I didn't know you train her.

34
00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:12.375
When do you play?

35
00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.375
Look. I'm not six years old.

36
00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.125
Can you please let me through?

37
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:24.250
Thank you.

38
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:40.416
- Do you need a fork?
- Yes. please.

39
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.083
How are you?

40
00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:57.958
How about you?

41
00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:00.916
I'm fine.

42
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.458
About tonight. do we stick to
our plan?

43
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.125
- If you don't feel like it...
- No. it's ok.

44
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.875
Fine.

45
00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:30.208
The only thing
is that Terry doesn't eat cheese.

46
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:33.083
It's been a month. I don't know
why.

47
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.708
It was her choice. All of a
sudden.

48
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.583
Have you seen Mattia?

49
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.125
Yes. I...

50
00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:46.333
I met him before.

51
00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:50.458
Ok.

52
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.166
Ok. see you later.

53
00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.083
- Mom.
- Honey.

54
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.458
Where's my pink sweater?

55
00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:31.625
- Did you check the clothes
rack?
- Right.

56
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:41.958
Thank you. dear.

57
00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.583
What's the matter?

58
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.000
Are you sure it's just
a business dinner?

59
00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:56.333
Wait.

60
00:09:58.041 --> 00:09:59.791
Get him something.

61
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.916
A dessert.

62
00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:07.000
- It means a lot to your sister.
- I know.

63
00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:10.333
- Come on!
- I'm going.

64
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.041
- Why are we stopping here?
- Get off.

65
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:13.166
- Aren't we going to dad's?
- Get off. Terry.

66
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:24.916
Come on!
How about a nice burger?

67
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.791
Come on!

68
00:11:58.041 --> 00:11:59.791
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

69
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.375
It's eleven twenty.

70
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.625
There you go.

71
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:06.125
- I'll get your change.
- Thank you.

72
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:07.666
Cool.

73
00:12:11.541 --> 00:12:13.750
Come on. dig in.

74
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.500
You are always eating!

75
00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:19.916
We are a little late.

76
00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.666
- Hi. little girl.
- Hello. kitty!

77
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:23.041
Hi!

78
00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:27.125
Bye. sweetie.

79
00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:31.000
- Terry. I'll be back in five
minutes.
- Where are you guys going?

80
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.125
Just back there. wait here.

81
00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:40.750
The coach says he won't cap
me anymore.

82
00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:43.000
if I don't go back to
two training sessions a week.

83
00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:44.583
He's right. Serves you right.

84
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.375
- My father doesn't let me out...
- Right. your father...

85
00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:50.125
- You mean Miss Marini...
- Ouch!

86
00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:53.333
She keeps you on a leash. like
a puppy.

87
00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:54.833
At least I get laid.

88
00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.041
At what cost?

89
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.791
- Teddy bear!
- Shut up.

90
00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:03.875
Stop screaming.
Shut up.

91
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:08.041
You have to come back.
Scrums with Montedoro suck.

92
00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.541
- Yes sir. my captain.
- Good boy.

93
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.000
You could always leave Miss
Marini
to Teddy Bear 2 and me!

94
00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:17.416
Shut your mouth.

95
00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:20.125
How bad do you wanna bang
her?

96
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.833
She is big-boned.

97
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.916
We'll take turns fucking her.

98
00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:41.166

00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:46.875
- What happened ?
- I saw a Jeep rushing away.

100
00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:48.208
Excuse me?

101
00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:52.666
Have you seen a little girl. red
hair?

102
00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:55.666
I came out as I heard her
screaming.

103
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.166
Terry?

104
00:13:58.125 --> 00:13:59.500
Terry?

105
00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:01.291
Teresa?

106
00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:04.208
Teresa?

107
00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:09.000
Terry?

108
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.208
Terry!

109
00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:15.250
I don't know. I just saw a Jeep...

110
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.000
Mattia. go talk to the waitress.

111
00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:48.500
<i>Mattia. where are you?</i>

112
00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:50.666
<i>Dad. I don't know what</i>
<i>happened...</i>

113
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.000
Calm down. please...

114
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.541
Mattia. I don't understand.

115
00:14:55.625 --> 00:14:59.458
<i>I swear. she just disappeared.</i>

116
00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.333
Are you sure?

117
00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:06.166
<i>Yes. I think so.</i>

118
00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:07.583
Where are you?

119
00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.708
<i>At the fast food</i>
<i>right behind mom's house.</i>

120
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:11.375
How long it has been?

121
00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:14.708
<i>I don't know. dad. ten minutes I</i>
<i>think.</i>

122
00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:16.291
Are you alone?

123
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.958
<i>Call the police. And don't move.</i>

124
00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:22.041
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

125
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.083
<i>We don't have the plate</i>
<i>of the suspect vehicle.</i>

126
00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:03.333

<i>green.</i>

128
00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:08.666
<i>We are placing roadblocks</i>
<i>around the area.</i>

129
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:18.625
Get a couple of officers.

130
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:22.708
Try to figure out if anybody
has seen or heard something.

131
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:31.583

135
00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:49.208

mother?

Not yet.

137
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:56.125

180
00:22:40.375 --> 00:22:43.833
and then a mission that started
badly
and ended up worse.

181
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.333
"Three years after discharge.
the patient is still highly
unstable.

182
00:22:51.458 --> 00:22:52.416
"tends towards isolation.

183
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.125
"shows high levels of social.
psychological and physical
disability."

184
00:22:58.083 --> 00:23:01.750
He refused treatment.
so they started dosing him up
with drugs.

185
00:23:02.083 --> 00:23:05.125
What if he has something to do
with the kidnapping?

186
00:23:07.416 --> 00:23:10.333
He must have made a few
enemies in the past.

187
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.125
His wife just came in.

188
00:23:15.375 --> 00:23:17.583
Maybe we can convince her
to get in touch with him...

189
00:23:17.916 --> 00:23:19.750
Riva is not coming back.

190
00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:25.208
He knows he has lost any
chance
of a friendly dialogue with us.

191
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:30.875
The investigation is too delicate.
he will screw everything up.

192
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:41.333
We have to stop this man.

193
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.166
Come here.

194
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.500
This is a self-service.
handsome.

195
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.958
- Look. do you sell...
- What do you need?

196
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:19.458
I need a lot of this stuff.

197
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:21.166
You want to go wild!

198
00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:24.083
Ok.

199
00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:26.166
Wait here.

200
00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:51.916
- You're right. he does look like
a cop.
- I told you!

201
00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:59.583
Guys. I just need information.

202
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:05.666
Go away.

203
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:08.458
You'd better not.

204
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.791
Tell me who deals it.

205
00:25:29.583 --> 00:25:30.833
I don't know.

206
00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:38.750
Please. I don't want to die.

207
00:25:38.916 --> 00:25:40.833
You're gonna beg me to kill you.

208
00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:44.041
The Mastiffs! It's their stuff.

209
00:25:47.791 --> 00:25:49.625
Tell where I can find them.

210
00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:02.625
What the fuck are you doing?

211
00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:51.458
What?

212
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:56.166
What do you mean. someone
followed you?
What did you do?

213
00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:05.916
Yes.

214
00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:13.041
I'll meet you there. yes.

215
00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:15.208
Yes.

216
00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:18.791
I'm going to help you with the
Jeep.

217
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.916
Mom...

218
00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:57.333
May I speak with you for a
second?

219
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.625
Any news from Mr. Riva?

220
00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:24.666
Can you think of someone
who might have been targeting
you?

221
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.875
Maybe a former colleague of
your husband.

222
00:29:29.708 --> 00:29:30.916
a superior...

223
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.041
No...

224
00:29:37.416 --> 00:29:38.708
Alright.

225
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.791
We'll call you as soon as we
have news.

226
00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:45.416
For anything. this is my
personal number.

227
00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:47.625
Open it up...

228
00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:53.166
Holy shit!

229
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.041
Come here.

230
00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:12.166
I thought you were gonna run
away
with one of his sluts...

231
00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:14.708
What the fuck are you saying?

232
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.375
- Do you have some stuff?
- Yes.

233
00:31:18.833 --> 00:31:20.375
Here.

234
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.041
Come on.

235
00:31:34.791 --> 00:31:37.041
How much is this? Did you
count it?

236
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:42.541
No. we gotta get rid of the car.

237
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.166
Where is my daughter?

238
00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:20.958
- Who do you work for?
- Nobody. we work for nobody.

239
00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:44.083
Where is she?

240
00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:52.625
Who did you sell her to?

241
00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:57.166
Who did you sell her to?

242
00:33:07.916 --> 00:33:09.541
Shit.

243
00:33:11.875 --> 00:33:13.458
Stop.

244
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:48.958
Shit.

245
00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:37.958
Go.

246
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.541
<i>The disappearance of little</i>
<i>Teresa Riva</i>
<i>is officially a kidnapping.</i>

247
00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:54.583
<i>Public Prosecutor's office</i>
<i>has promptly opened a case</i>

248
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:56.875
<i>and locked the city down.</i>

249
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.791
<i>These are hours of fear.</i>

250
00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:01.916
<i>crucial for the life</i>
<i>of the disappeared child.</i>

251
00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:07.541
<i>According to the investigators.</i>
<i>a kidnapping without a ransom</i>
<i>note</i>

252
00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:13.000
<i>would mean that the police</i>
<i>has very little time to find the</i>
<i>girl...</i>

253
00:36:23.666 --> 00:36:25.500
Sir...

254
00:36:28.666 --> 00:36:30.666
Is there anything I can do?

255
00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:33.750
I don't know.

256
00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:39.791
Take a seat.

257
00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:56.291
I know it's not easy.

258
00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.041
And it's no use
to tell you to be calm.

259
00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:03.916
But we're doing everything we
can
to find your sister.

260
00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:09.208
But you can stay close to your
mother.

261
00:37:10.375 --> 00:37:12.500
Stick together.

262
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:44.000
Mattia? I have to ask you
to leave the office.

263
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.083
- So?
- We managed to catch the
Jeep.

264
00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:02.083
It changed several license
plates
in the past four months.

265
00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:03.666
but there is a pattern.

266
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.416
It went through this road
regularly this week.

267
00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:09.208
What do we have in the area?

268
00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:11.000
There is a shipyard.

269
00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:13.625
There is more.

270
00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:17.083
Just before
the Jeep came through here
tonight.

271
00:38:17.291 --> 00:38:18.875
Take a look.

272
00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:22.083
It's Riva's car.

273
00:38:24.416 --> 00:38:26.250
I knew it.

274
00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:28.666
- Do you think that he...
- I think that he...

275
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:32.208
I think that
he is a former soldier on
medication.

276
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.125
who ran from a crime scene

277
00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:38.083
and made us lose the track
of who was likely to be our
kidnapper.

278
00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:41.333
And now he appears again
around the only suspect area

279
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.416
we were able to identify.

280
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.458
And what do we do?

281
00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:48.791
Do we believe in coincidence.
now?
What the fuck!

282
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:24.250
My house is under surveillance.

283
00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:29.125
I'm sorry.

284
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:34.291
There are more bandages in
there.

285
00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:38.333
I'll get them.

286
00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:15.333
<i>The number you dialed...</i>

287
00:41:30.916 --> 00:41:33.708
If you know something.
you must tell the police.

288
00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:44.916
Let's go to the police station.

289
00:41:50.916 --> 00:41:52.458
Let's go together.

290
00:41:58.458 --> 00:41:59.750
Mattia is there.

291
00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.458
He needs you.

292
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:17.708
- If you go it alone. you'll die.
- At least our daughter will be
safe.

293
00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:48.333
Lights are on.

294
00:42:50.791 --> 00:42:52.000
That's strange.

295
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:57.833
What's wrong?

296
00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:02.250
Maybe Riva has nothing to do
with it.

297
00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:06.333
Maybe we're just following the
same lead.

298
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:10.041
and he is ahead of us.

299
00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:16.333
Are we doing the "pissed-off
boss" routine?

300
00:43:20.875 --> 00:43:22.458
Come on. let's go.

301
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.750
Is anybody there?

302
00:43:58.208 --> 00:43:59.750
Is there anyone?

303
00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.583
What do you need?

304
00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:08.083
Hello.

305
00:44:08.458 --> 00:44:10.125
I know it's late. but...

306
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:12.375
our car broke down over there.

307
00:44:14.708 --> 00:44:17.250
Please!
Can you lend us some cables?

308
00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:20.250
We have been traveling
since this morning...

309
00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:24.041
My boss is a little nervous.

310
00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:26.000
Nervous?

311
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.833
He looks like an asshole to me.

312
00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:33.625
Wait here.

313
00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:19.791
- So. where's the car?
- At the gate.

314
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:23.666
Your colleague
kindly offered himself to...

315
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.875
Ok. but you can't be here.
Come on.

316
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.125
Let's go to that gate
and fix your car.

317
00:45:34.916 --> 00:45:36.291
May I ask you a question?

318
00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:39.708
Here...

319
00:45:42.625 --> 00:45:44.583
do you work with open flames?

320
00:46:06.666 --> 00:46:09.250
- Who the fuck are you?
- Police. drop your weapons.

321
00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:12.500
- Drop that gun.
- Yes.

322
00:46:12.916 --> 00:46:16.875
Tell your friend not to fuck
around
or I'll blow his head off.

323
00:46:20.708 --> 00:46:23.166
Ok. easy. easy...

324
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.750
You'd better not.

325
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:36.500
I'm going to put my gun down
now.

326
00:46:45.958 --> 00:46:47.375
Listen...

327
00:46:49.208 --> 00:46:54.041
There is a sniper squad ready
to fire.
if anything goes wrong.

328
00:47:19.583 --> 00:47:22.125
Easy.

329
00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:24.333
Keep calm.

330
00:47:26.625 --> 00:47:27.958
It's gonna be alright.

331
00:47:33.833 --> 00:47:34.875
What do you want?

332
00:47:34.958 --> 00:47:37.375
We are looking
for the owner of an old Jeep.

333
00:47:50.666 --> 00:47:51.875
No.

334
00:47:52.041 --> 00:47:53.458
Fuck.

335
00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:23.916
Hey!

336
00:48:27.166 --> 00:48:29.333
We found a burned body.

337
00:48:29.583 --> 00:48:30.791
30-year-old male.

338
00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:34.375
They must have gotten rid of
him
an hour ago. tops.

339
00:48:40.166 --> 00:48:41.583
What about the Jeep?

340
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.291
They found it.

341
00:48:44.083 --> 00:48:45.583
At the scrap yard.

342
00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:52.541
Look. there is something more.

343
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.416
We found this. near the body.

344
00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:03.583
We have to examine it. but...

345
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:06.500
it's a baby tooth.

346
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.666
After the kidnapping.

347
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.625
he called the girl
and a different number three
times.

348
00:49:52.958 --> 00:49:54.625
Can we trace it?

349
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:03.833
What do you know
about these people?

350
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.750
They were talking about a man
and his prostitutes.

351
00:50:09.666 --> 00:50:12.000
Keep him on the line
for at least 20-30 seconds.

352
00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:21.041
<i>Hello?</i>

353
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.083
- Hi. they gave me your number.
<i>- Who's there?</i>

354
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:28.333
I need... some girls.

355
00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:31.083
- About ten. for a party.
<i>- Do you know what time it is?</i>

356
00:50:31.291 --> 00:50:33.625
My boss is very demanding.

357
00:50:34.083 --> 00:50:35.125
<i>For when?</i>

358
00:50:35.625 --> 00:50:36.791
Tomorrow.

359
00:50:37.833 --> 00:50:40.000
<i>Quiet!</i>
<i>Fucking dog.</i>

360
00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:42.666
<i>- Now I'm busy.</i>
- Wait.

361
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:50.375
Northbound road.
past viale Maria Valerio. Look.

362
00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:53.625
You have an overall radius
of two hundred meters.

363
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.208
It will be hard to find him.

364
00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.916
It will have to do.

365
00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:02.875
Leonida Riva.

366
00:51:03.833 --> 00:51:05.375
nobody's son.

367
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.166
"The beast".

368
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.500
No way you changed. fuck.

369
00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:13.541
Neither did you.

370
00:51:14.125 --> 00:51:15.208
Hey.

371
00:51:17.083 --> 00:51:18.583
I've lost four pounds.

372
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.250
I know how you feel.

373
00:51:24.166 --> 00:51:26.708
You can't wait to jump into the
void.

374
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:29.083
to go back on a mission...

375
00:51:30.416 --> 00:51:33.458
It's the only thing
we know how to do. right?

376
00:51:38.125 --> 00:51:39.708
Where did it happen?

377
00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:45.208
There was this moment.

378
00:51:46.125 --> 00:51:47.541
after the blast...

379
00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:51.958
They were taking me away in a
helicopter.

380
00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:55.916
I was messed up.
so high on morphine.

381
00:51:56.916 --> 00:51:58.833
But I definitely remember one
thing.

382
00:52:00.958 --> 00:52:02.375
I was bleeding to death and
thinking:

383
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:05.708
"Fuck. if I can't walk anymore.
I can't fight anymore".

384
00:52:06.208 --> 00:52:10.041
Going back to a normal life
looked like a nightmare to me.

385
00:52:11.916 --> 00:52:13.416
But then...

386
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:19.541
I realized I was neither the first
nor the last one feeling that way.

387
00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:21.041
That I could survive.

388
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.083
because someone.
before me. did make it.

389
00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:30.375
Knowing this was enough for
me.

390
00:52:37.375 --> 00:52:39.250
Take care. Leo.

391
00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:31.958
Captain.

392
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:35.958
We're bringing you back home
now.

393
00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:52.541
There are more!

394
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.583
Easy. easy!

395
00:55:06.583 --> 00:55:08.708
Go. go. go.

396
00:55:21.875 --> 00:55:24.583
- Go. go!
- For Christ's sake.

397
00:55:30.166 --> 00:55:32.541
Downstairs!

398
00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:45.250
Move. move!

399
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:50.416
Go!

400
00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:50.416
My wife would have complained.

401
00:57:50.583 --> 00:57:52.416
But I never complain. you
know...

402
00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:20.666
Mozart. please...

403
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:25.791
I have nothing to do with it. I
swear.
Please...

404
00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:28.375
Your boss told me something
different.

405
00:58:32.583 --> 00:58:35.125
- I didn't want to...
- Neither do I.

406
00:58:36.916 --> 00:58:39.750
If it were not for you
and your Prince Charming.

407
00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.166
The cops are breathing down
our necks.

408
00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:50.500
I've made an ass of myself
with a client. a big one.

409
00:58:51.333 --> 00:58:54.250
To make matters worse. we are
stuck
with that girl who's worth shit
now.

410
00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:57.916
How is that possible?
We took her that age on
purpose.

411
00:58:58.041 --> 00:59:00.916
So you do have
something to do with it?

412
00:59:01.333 --> 00:59:05.083
I mean. we took her that age
because you told us that...

413
00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:08.041
you can place girls that age in a
second.

414
00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:10.625
- Exactly.
- That's why we did it.

415
00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:12.166
It's all my fault.

416
00:59:51.083 --> 00:59:55.916
Get rid of her first thing in the
morning.
We've made enough of a mess
tonight.

417
00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:57.666
What about the girl?

418
01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:02.791
The deal is off.

419
01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:06.333
Everybody is looking for her.
we couldn't leave her there.

420
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.250
Make her disappear too.

421
01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:14.208
What's up?

422
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:19.791
Oh you poor things.
you're breaking my heart...

423
01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:25.416
I'll deal with that. Go get her.

424
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.416
Hurry up!

425
01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:41.125
Hello?

426
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:49.583
Ivan. hi!

427
01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:55.041
Did you see the picture?
Only the best for my friends.

428
01:00:56.416 --> 01:00:58.291
That's the price. I'm sorry.

429
01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:01.625
Tomorrow is fine.

430
01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:03.791
<i>Dasvidania.</i>

431
01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:10.625
What's happening?

432
01:01:13.083 --> 01:01:16.083
It happens that the world
is a wonderful place.

433
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:19.250
Full of fucking perverts.

434
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.375
That is?

435
01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:25.416
That is. take the girl
and bring her back there.

436
01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:27.541
Come on.

437
01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.000
What is happening?

438
01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:51.041
We are bringing you back.

439
01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:16.333
What now?

440
01:02:17.416 --> 01:02:19.541
I need to go to the toilet.

441
01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:23.375
Hurry. or the boss's gonna be
mad.

442
01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:44.750
Open up!

443
01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.500
Open the fuck up!

444
01:02:48.375 --> 01:02:49.458
Dad!

445
01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:04.916
Who the fuck are you?

446
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.041
<i>Dad!</i>

447
01:03:41.958 --> 01:03:43.250
Upstairs!

448
01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:42.500
They kept me in a dark room.
isolated.

449
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.625
They wanted intelligence.

450
01:05:47.416 --> 01:05:51.291
Then the rescue team came to
save me.

451
01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:54.875
They killed them pretty fast.

452
01:05:56.125 --> 01:05:58.750
I tried to take one out.

453
01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:01.625
They cut his throat.

454
01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:05.041
Captain Riva.

455
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.208
your conduct during the
imprisonment
was exemplary.

456
01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:14.125
The Secret Services
followed the ops closely

457
01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:16.666
and were impressed by your
skills.

458
01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:19.250
They could use someone like
you.

459
01:06:21.666 --> 01:06:25.000
They want to bury me under
State secrets. don't they.
General?

460
01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:26.875
It's a promotion. Riva.

461
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.625
Speak your mind. Captain.

462
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:45.000
I feel you want
to make your point. please.

463
01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:47.625
Yes.

464
01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:54.166
The rescue mission was too
dangerous.

465
01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:59.333
You know better than me
you should have left me there.
General.

466
01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:04.500
Or. if you didn't trust me

467
01:07:04.666 --> 01:07:07.250
you should have bombed
the whole area.

468
01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:11.666
instead of sending an entire
squad
to their death.

469
01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:17.250
In front of my eyes.

470
01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:25.333
<i>Think of what the Services are</i>
<i>offering.</i>
<i>It's an opportunity. think it over.</i>

471
01:07:26.583 --> 01:07:29.625
<i>I don't need to think it over.</i>
<i>General.</i>

472
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:34.333
<i>I request discharge and</i>
<i>immediate return.</i>

473
01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.875
Keep your eyes open. sir.

474
01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:06.500
Go!

475
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.041
Would you like some?

476
01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:00.625
Thank you.

477
01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:07.541
They said they won't let us in
until the deputy chief arrives.

478
01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:23.083
You know...

479
01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:26.208
When I met your father...

480
01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:29.791
he was finishing the training
course.

481
01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:33.333
He pretended to speak Arabic.

482
01:11:37.166 --> 01:11:38.541
He made me laugh.

483
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.791
Then he stopped.

484
01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:50.083
When he came back home
after his discharge...

485
01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.041
he had become bitter.

486
01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:55.500
Distracted.

487
01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.875
A stranger.

488
01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:04.583
And you kicked him out.

489
01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:09.833
He is the one who left.

490
01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.333
I wanted him to stay.

491
01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:20.666
I wanted to deal with it together.

492
01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:22.958
as a family.

493
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:30.208
But it was like your father
was afraid to get some help.

494
01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:42.041
He wanted to protect us.
by keeping us away.

495
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.791
I hated him.

496
01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.500
Even if...

497
01:13:10.541 --> 01:13:12.583
I've never stopped loving him.

498
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.666
Sorry...

499
01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.666
Mrs. Riva...

500
01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:10.833
- May I?
- No.

501
01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:15.291
I need to see if he's ok.

502
01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:17.458
Please.

503
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.250
Thank you.

504
01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:03.791
Where is your mother?

505
01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.166
She is smoking downstairs.

506
01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:20.083
Police have found some
remains of a body.

507
01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:22.791
They are trying to understand
if...

508
01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:24.541
It's not Teresa.

509
01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:27.791
I saw her.

510
01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:30.166
She's fine.

511
01:15:35.208 --> 01:15:36.583
Come here.

512
01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:41.916
I need your help.

513
01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:43.958
Ok...

514
01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.625
Check my medical records.

515
01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:52.000
See if there is a paper clip.

516
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:57.125
Stay out of sight.

517
01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.583
- It's there.
- Good.

518
01:16:02.541 --> 01:16:03.958
Good.

519
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:06.583
Now open it.

520
01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:16.666
Hand it to me.

521
01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:19.083
Stay there.

522
01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:20.666
Stay there.

523
01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:24.625
Come on.

524
01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:26.333
Good.

525
01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:37.291
Now...

526
01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:41.250
Now it may happen

527
01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:47.208
that the guard gets suspicious
and comes in.

528
01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:49.083
Ok.

529
01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.750
If that happens.

530
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:54.541
I need you to run and close the
door.

531
01:16:55.541 --> 01:17:00.208
Then you stay there and don't
move.
no matter what happens next.

532
01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:02.541
Ok.

533
01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:05.833
- Understood?
- Yes.

534
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:09.416
Now.

535
01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:14.625
Open this fucking door!
Open!

536
01:17:19.125 --> 01:17:20.791
Easy. easy.

537
01:17:22.291 --> 01:17:24.291
Easy...

538
01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.666
Shit.

539
01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.750
Wait.

540
01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:35.333
Stay there.

541
01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:38.000
Move back.

542
01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:41.083
Now take the radio and call the
station.

543
01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:44.583
You have to run a check
on a previous offender.

544
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:46.375
His nickname is Mozart.

545
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.750
I want to know where I can find
him.

546
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.541
Station.
this is officer Petrassi speaking.

547
01:17:52.708 --> 01:17:54.583
I need to run a check.

548
01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:56.958
<i>Name and surname. please.</i>

549
01:17:58.125 --> 01:17:59.625
I only have a nickname. Mozart.

550
01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:01.333
<i>Just a second.</i>

551
01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:09.125
<i>I only have one match.</i>
<i>Gianrico Sala. 50 years old...</i>

552
01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:10.375
<i>He did his time twice.</i>

553
01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:13.333
<i>The system reports</i>
<i>a building downtown in his</i>
<i>name.</i>

554
01:18:13.416 --> 01:18:14.958
<i>several apartments out of town.</i>

555
01:18:15.041 --> 01:18:17.791
<i>and a restaurant.</i>
<i>"The Black Pearl". all legit.</i>

556
01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:21.500
<i>There is also a wellness centre</i>
<i>that went bankrupt a couple of</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

557
01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:25.458
<i>on the last floor of Skytower.</i>
<i>its name is "Two of hearts".</i>

558
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:29.916
<i>Dad!</i>

559
01:18:30.458 --> 01:18:34.125
<i>Petrassi. the deputy chief is</i>
<i>here.</i>
<i>do I let him come upstairs?</i>

560
01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:36.333
Give me the radio.

561
01:18:37.708 --> 01:18:38.875
Fast.

562
01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:41.125
<i>Petrassi. do you copy?</i>

563
01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:43.625
Get down.

564
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.791
<i>- Petrassi. what's happening?</i>
- Handcuff yourself.

565
01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:06.500
Riva!

566
01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:30.458
Dad.

567
01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.833
Please. don't shoot.

568
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.708
Don't shoot.

569
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.208
Freeze!

570
01:19:49.625 --> 01:19:51.208
Drop the guns.

571
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.916
Drop the guns!

572
01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.875
The first results have arrived.

573
01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:01.416
it's not her.

574
01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:05.791
The remains belong to
somebody
who died six months ago.

575
01:20:07.166 --> 01:20:08.708
<i>Riva is on the run.</i>

576
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:10.541
Stay here.

577
01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:22.125
Oh my goodness. help!

578
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.375
Get out!

579
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.541
Riva!

580
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:43.958
Riva!

581
01:20:45.083 --> 01:20:46.375
Fuck.

582
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.500
Call the police.

583
01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:01.208
Tell them where they can catch
up with me.

584
01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:14.250
On Sunday we have the
qualifying match
for the first division.

585
01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:20.250
Try to get back.

586
01:21:58.208 --> 01:21:59.250
Ivan!

587
01:22:04.125 --> 01:22:05.541
<i>Privet!</i>

588
01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:07.750
Would you like something to
drink?

589
01:22:11.583 --> 01:22:13.791
You'll see. you're going to like
her.

590
01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:15.708
Considering how much it costs...

591
01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:17.625
Money is hell.

592
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.375
What's wrong?

593
01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:57.916
You bastard!

594
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.250
I kill you!

595
01:23:04.958 --> 01:23:06.416
I kill you!

596
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:21.666
Now. you die.

597
01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.291
Dad.

598
01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:37.250
You found me.

599
01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.250
It's ok. now.

600
01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:57.125
Where is mom?

601
01:24:58.416 --> 01:25:00.416
We’re going back home. now.

602
01:25:01.208 --> 01:25:02.708
We'll find her.

603
01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:19.625
No.

604
01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:22.666
Please...

605
01:25:27.958 --> 01:25:29.583
I'm sorry.

606
01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:32.666
Let us go.

607
01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:36.125
I'm begging you...

608
01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:08.041
Be careful. it's hot.

609
01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:25.708
- Wait a moment.
- Where are you going?

610
01:26:27.125 --> 01:26:28.541
I'll be right back.

611
01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:49.708
Thank you.

612
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:00.458
We found a body. at the
shipyard...

613
01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:05.750
DNA tests confirmed...

614
01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:09.166
it’s a little girl who disappeared
in the North. a few months ago.

615
01:27:10.375 --> 01:27:14.000
We found... at least two related
cases.

616
01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:16.833
And we're gonna find more.

617
01:27:18.708 --> 01:27:21.958
Now that we have a lead
between Mozart and the
Mastiffs.

618
01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:25.416
Riva...

619
01:27:26.333 --> 01:27:27.875
You did a good job.

620
01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:40.958
I’d like to bring her
back to her mother first.

621
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.416
- How’s your tea?
- It's hot.

622
01:31:36.833 --> 01:31:39.875
A MONTH LATER

623
01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:42.250
I'd like to thank you all.

624
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.541
Seeing your long faces.

625
01:31:46.333 --> 01:31:49.500
I realize that it could have been
worse.

626
01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:52.916
Much worse.

627
01:31:54.583 --> 01:31:56.875
Does anybody want to say
something?

628
01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:00.625
He never speaks.

629
01:32:01.166 --> 01:32:04.250
That's true!
You are half off your nut. aren't
you?

630
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.625
Everybody says you are happy.
you think you are in a hotel.

631
01:32:07.791 --> 01:32:10.541
Fuck. I'd like to be in a hotel too.

632
01:32:12.875 --> 01:32:14.416
What was your job?

633
01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:17.208
I was...

634
01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:22.250
I worked in the army.

635
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.333
Did you fight in a war?

636
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.000
More than one.

637
01:32:46.208 --> 01:32:49.208
THE BEAST
