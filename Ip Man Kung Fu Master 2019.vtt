{\an8}Taking advantage of my Axes Gang...

4
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.628
{\an8}Who's behind you?

5
00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:07.719
{\an8}Explain.
Before this cigarette burns out.

6
00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:25.904
Sir.

7
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.907
{\an8}Can I live?

8
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.744
{\an8}For a man.
it's not important when to die.

9
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.788
{\an8}but how to live.

10
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.708
{\an8}You did it poorly.

11
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.798
{\an8}Sir! Sir!

12
00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:54.391
<i>Kungfu...</i>

13
00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.976
<i>Why do we practice it?</i>

14
00:01:56.935 --> 00:01:58.228
<i>My master said.</i>

15
00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:01.815
<i>it's a Kungfu master's duty to save
those in danger and help those in need.</i>

16
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.527
<i>I. Ip Man.
bear my masters' words in mind.</i>

17
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.280
<i>Taking the post
as Captain of the Foshan Police.</i>

18
00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:11.574
<i>I hope to uphold the rule of law</i>

19
00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:13.868
<i>and guard the safety of local people.</i>

20
00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:48.445
POLICE AND DOGS NOT ALLOWED

21
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.121
Ip Man. can't you read?

22
00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:02.500
Don't you know the law?

23
00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:07.964
In Foshan. we Axes are the law.

24
00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:12.093
Well. I know only one set of rules.
It's the law of the country.

25
00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:13.637
San Ye killed Mr. Mai.

26
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.431
I must follow the legal procedures.

27
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:20.894
San Ye has said

28
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:23.480
if you defeat us and get upstairs.
he will go with you.

29
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.932
Sir. it's your turn.

30
00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:03.019
Your Vehicle is watching in the central.

31
00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:04.771
I'll use two linked Horses to attack.

32
00:05:40.158 --> 00:05:44.621
Sir. perhaps you're not able
to block my Vehicle.

33
00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:51.711
Perhaps you'll lose your Vehicle.

34
00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:09.271
I'm vigorous as a tiger.

35
00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:10.605
Very good.

36
00:06:19.114 --> 00:06:20.073
Cannon!

37
00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:21.658
Vehicle!

38
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.504
A Soldier is as capable as the Vehicle
after crossing the River.

39
00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:42.178
I'll take this.

40
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:49.060
This.

41
00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:57.485
Sir...

42
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:00.697
I don't think you can win this game.

43
00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:03.992
No rush. It's not decided yet.

44
00:07:15.503 --> 00:07:17.672
Checkmate. sir.

45
00:07:33.647 --> 00:07:34.773
Checkmate!

46
00:07:38.318 --> 00:07:39.319
Sir.

47
00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.655
You're using my Vehicle
to take my General.

48
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.573
That's not in the rule.

49
00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:51.373
Sir! You...

50
00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:56.378
You talk about the rules?

51
00:07:57.087 --> 00:07:59.589
It's... your assistant.

52
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:04.761
In Foshan.
anyone who trades opium must die.

53
00:08:05.512 --> 00:08:08.390
You and Mr. Mai used my ports
to smuggle opium

54
00:08:08.598 --> 00:08:09.683
and help the Japanese.

55
00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:12.018
You're blatantly challenging
the rule of the Axes.

56
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.480
Captain Ip. am I right?

57
00:08:16.022 --> 00:08:16.982
Sir!

58
00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:19.317
Every family has its rules.
And so does a country.

59
00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:21.361
Violators should be punished by law.

60
00:08:22.487 --> 00:08:23.863
That's very true.

61
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.243
Sir! Forgive me. sir!

62
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.871
This is my law.

63
00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:36.710
Captain Ip.

64
00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:39.211
I'll go with you...

65
00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:42.799
to see your law.

66
00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:44.883
Dad!

67
00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:48.054
Take care of the family and business
till I come back.

68
00:08:52.642 --> 00:08:53.602
Hello. Sir.

69
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.769
Sir.

70
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:57.689
Hello. Sir.

71
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.578
Sir.

72
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.290
Hello. Sir.

73
00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:24.758
Chief. how's our welcoming ceremony
for San Ye?

74
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.510
Good...

75
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.110
But I still feel something's missing.

76
00:09:52.494 --> 00:09:54.287
PROTECT THE PEOPLE
VANQUISH CRIME

77
00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:04.130
Sir. the Axes are extraordinary.

78
00:10:13.682 --> 00:10:14.683
Captain Ip.

79
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.395
you trust in law. I trust in the Axes.

80
00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:21.356
Could you ask your chief for me:
What does he trust?

81
00:10:24.609 --> 00:10:25.819
Yes. sir.

82
00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:28.029
My surname is Yuan.

83
00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:31.783
But I can change that.

84
00:10:33.618 --> 00:10:35.787
This way. sir.

85
00:10:37.581 --> 00:10:39.040
You can change your surname.

86
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:43.211
but don't forget your origin
and ancestors.

87
00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:46.006
Thanks for your instruction. sir.

88
00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:49.426
This way. to my office. sir.

89
00:10:50.093 --> 00:10:51.052
Chief.

90
00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.513
according to law.
San Ye should go to jail.

91
00:10:53.722 --> 00:10:55.599
- He should go this way.
- You...

92
00:10:58.018 --> 00:10:59.060
Captain Ip.

93
00:10:59.686 --> 00:11:02.522
Do you know
why I go with you this time?

94
00:11:03.231 --> 00:11:04.858
Because you killed Mr. Mai.

95
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.611
Mr. Mai worked for the Japanese.

96
00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:09.529
They won't let you get away with it.

97
00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:13.366
You think I'm safer staying here
than at my place?

98
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.493
Don't you think so?

99
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.081
You come to my place. alone.
and defeat dozens of my people.

100
00:11:20.957 --> 00:11:22.250
Your Kungfu is excellent.

101
00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:24.336
I admire you.

102
00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:30.050
I want to help you
to gain fame in Foshan.

103
00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:35.597
Besides. the Japanese used Mr. Mai
to smuggle opium via my ports.

104
00:11:36.097 --> 00:11:37.933
I want to see how your law

105
00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:40.560
can handle the Japanese.

106
00:11:41.394 --> 00:11:45.440
I can assure you. sir.
as long as I'm a policeman in Foshan.

107
00:11:45.732 --> 00:11:48.443
I'll deal with every case
according to the law.

108
00:11:54.366 --> 00:11:56.368
Get together!
Search the Japanese commerce chamber!

109
00:12:05.085 --> 00:12:07.003
Turn left or turn right!

110
00:12:19.933 --> 00:12:20.934
Get straight.

111
00:12:22.477 --> 00:12:23.436
Turn right!

112
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:25.230
Go!

113
00:12:34.197 --> 00:12:35.198
Be careful.

114
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:47.002
Work harder.

115
00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:50.297
Work harder.

116
00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:54.759
Hurry up. you guys.

117
00:12:57.304 --> 00:12:58.346
Come and help me.

118
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:06.938
Vice-captain. look!

119
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:16.156
Open that. too!

120
00:13:16.615 --> 00:13:17.574
Come on.

121
00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:29.169
Vice-captain.

122
00:13:31.212 --> 00:13:33.256
it's all... money.

123
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.139
You won't find opium here.

124
00:13:41.348 --> 00:13:43.558
I'm the new chairman
of the commerce chamber.

125
00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:46.061
I haven't had the time to visit you all.

126
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:49.230
Foshan's safety and peace
rests on your shoulders

127
00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:52.609
These banknotes.
take as many as you can carry.

128
00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:36.945
Sir. what is this for?

129
00:14:45.912 --> 00:14:49.666
If you're in time. you might be able
to see San Ye one last time.

130
00:14:51.126 --> 00:14:52.294
Bye. Take care.

131
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.584
- San Ye! Sir!
- Release that. San Ye!

132
00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:16.127
- Let go of it. sir!
- Release that!

133
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.921
- San Ye. release that!
- Stop!

134
00:16:18.129 --> 00:16:19.089
Captain!

135
00:16:19.464 --> 00:16:22.050
Captain. The chief said San Ye
killed himself to escape punishment.

136
00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:00.922
Be quick! Take it down!

137
00:17:01.047 --> 00:17:02.007
Stop!

138
00:17:03.842 --> 00:17:06.094
Next time we shall hang a Japanese flag.

139
00:17:07.137 --> 00:17:08.096
Chief Yuan.

140
00:17:08.555 --> 00:17:11.641
if we police abuse the law.
how can we uphold justice?

141
00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:14.477
Don't look! Take it down!

142
00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:18.648
Chief. you do forget your ancestors.

143
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.075
If San Ye lived.

144
00:17:32.162 --> 00:17:34.581
I shall die.

145
00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:40.670
This is the fate
for a police officer in Foshan.

146
00:17:42.631 --> 00:17:46.426
You're still too young.

147
00:17:49.721 --> 00:17:50.680
Come on!

148
00:17:51.222 --> 00:17:52.390
Take it down!

149
00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.558
Be quick!

150
00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:56.603
But I don't believe in fate.

151
00:17:57.437 --> 00:17:59.773
Not everyone fears to die like you do.

152
00:18:00.565 --> 00:18:01.900
San Ye's death...

153
00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:04.194
I shall get him justice.

154
00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:09.032
- Hang it well! It's tilted.
- Captain.

155
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:13.245
Your family has called.
Your wife has difficulty in labor.

156
00:18:14.913 --> 00:18:18.416
If I can't serve justice in this costume.

157
00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:20.585
why should I wear it?

158
00:18:49.739 --> 00:18:50.907
- Uncle!
- Here!

159
00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:54.035
Gather the people! Count our money!

160
00:18:54.953 --> 00:18:57.122
We shall capture Ip Man alive!

161
00:18:57.831 --> 00:18:59.791
I'll make him a living sacrifice
to my father!

162
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.585
Capture Ip Man!

163
00:19:01.793 --> 00:19:03.128
Sacrifice him to San Ye!

164
00:19:05.672 --> 00:19:06.631
Hurry!

165
00:19:08.508 --> 00:19:10.844
Come on! Harder! Harder!

166
00:19:12.095 --> 00:19:13.221
Hold your breath and push!

167
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.640
- Wing-sing. I'm back!
- Harder! Push!

168
00:19:15.849 --> 00:19:17.267
One. two. push!

169
00:19:18.226 --> 00:19:19.185
Hurry!

170
00:19:19.311 --> 00:19:20.812
Almost there! Come on!

171
00:19:21.396 --> 00:19:22.897
Again! Push!

172
00:19:24.774 --> 00:19:25.650
Wing-sing!

173
00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:27.402
Harder! Come on!

174
00:19:27.611 --> 00:19:31.489
A police captain's home...
I can't even find any decent wine.

175
00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.036
It's you!

176
00:19:36.161 --> 00:19:37.704
What're you doing at my house?

177
00:19:39.581 --> 00:19:40.498
Push!

178
00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:41.499
Hot water!

179
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.335
Brother Man.

180
00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:46.922
Are you deaf?

181
00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:48.548
They're asking for hot water!

182
00:19:49.132 --> 00:19:50.050
Hurry up!

183
00:19:51.134 --> 00:19:52.093
Go.

184
00:19:54.888 --> 00:19:57.766
May I know
why you keep coming to me?

185
00:19:58.391 --> 00:20:00.435
Simple. I want you to pay
for my daily spends.

186
00:20:00.644 --> 00:20:02.437
I want to live at your place
and spend your money.

187
00:20:04.189 --> 00:20:05.774
Could I have your name. please?

188
00:20:06.608 --> 00:20:09.694
You silly boy! It's too difficult for you
to know who I am.

189
00:20:10.737 --> 00:20:12.989
You old cad!
Do you know whose place this is?

190
00:20:13.198 --> 00:20:15.408
It's Captain Ip's!
Do you know that?

191
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.839
Hot water! Hot water!

192
00:20:39.557 --> 00:20:42.727
To whoever captures Ip Man.
I'll offer three gold chips.

193
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.229
Go!

194
00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:45.897
Go! Go!

195
00:20:47.148 --> 00:20:48.108
Hurry!

196
00:21:01.204 --> 00:21:02.497
Why hasn't the hot water come?

197
00:21:02.622 --> 00:21:03.623
Hot water!

198
00:21:04.124 --> 00:21:05.208
Go!

199
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.511
Anyone alive? Where's the water?

200
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.890
Fights again. They never end!

201
00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:27.314
What's going on?

202
00:21:27.522 --> 00:21:29.399
No big deal.
Someone's come to celebrate for you.

203
00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:31.026
Go!

204
00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:58.178
Superb!

205
00:22:02.057 --> 00:22:03.516
I don't want to be
an enemy of the Axes.

206
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.352
Tell that to my father!

207
00:22:12.025 --> 00:22:12.984
Kill him!

208
00:22:14.527 --> 00:22:16.112
Push! Harder!

209
00:22:17.197 --> 00:22:19.491
Don't be bothered by those outside.
The baby is the most important.

210
00:22:26.248 --> 00:22:27.707
One. two. three!

211
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:29.376
Push!

212
00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:39.427
Old guy. help!

213
00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:41.012
A woman is delivering.

214
00:22:41.221 --> 00:22:43.181
How can an old man like me help her?

215
00:22:44.557 --> 00:22:46.351
Help us fight!

216
00:22:46.726 --> 00:22:48.436
He's pulling his punches.
He deserves to be hit hard.

217
00:22:48.687 --> 00:22:50.897
- Why would I bother to help him?
- Your wine for two years!

218
00:22:51.106 --> 00:22:53.024
I'll pay for your wine for two years!

219
00:22:54.943 --> 00:22:56.736
Young man. remember your words.

220
00:23:02.534 --> 00:23:05.120
One. two. three. push!

221
00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:15.630
Almost!

222
00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:16.798
Harder!

223
00:23:24.014 --> 00:23:25.765
Young girl. don't be so aggressive.

224
00:23:27.684 --> 00:23:29.978
I'll give you an explanation
in three days.

225
00:23:30.395 --> 00:23:32.606
I will kill you! I swear!

226
00:23:32.814 --> 00:23:33.857
Miss. let's go.

227
00:23:34.065 --> 00:23:35.317
- Hands off!
- Let's go!

228
00:23:37.986 --> 00:23:39.154
Go! Go!

229
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.658
Thank you for helping me.

230
00:23:53.627 --> 00:23:55.045
Hush. hush. Don't cry.

231
00:23:56.796 --> 00:23:57.756
He's unhappy.

232
00:23:57.923 --> 00:23:58.882
Hush...

233
00:23:59.507 --> 00:24:00.926
Be careful with the wraps.

234
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:05.931
Take him.

235
00:24:11.937 --> 00:24:14.064
- Ribby.
- Brother Man. the soup.

236
00:24:14.272 --> 00:24:15.231
OK.

237
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.734
What're you looking at?

238
00:24:18.151 --> 00:24:21.529
We searched the commerce chamber today.
It's all clear.

239
00:24:22.864 --> 00:24:26.826
Keep a close watch on them.
And the ports of the Axes. too.

240
00:24:27.744 --> 00:24:30.413
- Report to me if you find anything.
- OK.

241
00:24:31.498 --> 00:24:32.916
What're you looking at?

242
00:24:37.295 --> 00:24:38.255
Wing-sing.

243
00:24:38.588 --> 00:24:40.840
I cooked some chicken soup for you.

244
00:24:41.216 --> 00:24:42.467
It's a little bit hot.

245
00:24:43.468 --> 00:24:47.055
The midwife said
you need nutrition after labor.

246
00:24:51.393 --> 00:24:52.352
Here.

247
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.231
Is it good?

248
00:24:56.856 --> 00:24:57.774
Delicious.

249
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.280
Wing-sing.

250
00:25:03.405 --> 00:25:06.449
it's a little bit busy
at the police station these days.

251
00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:07.951
I'm thinking...

252
00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:11.204
I won't persuade you to leave.

253
00:25:11.413 --> 00:25:13.248
And please don't ask me
to leave you. too.

254
00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:16.084
OK. All right. then.

255
00:25:18.086 --> 00:25:20.171
I only feel safe when you're around.

256
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:29.055
Boy.

257
00:25:29.764 --> 00:25:32.058
don't be so stubborn
like your mother when you grow up.

258
00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:35.103
Be like your father. then.
In that case you'll be stubborner.

259
00:25:37.355 --> 00:25:38.690
Hush... Don't cry.

260
00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:45.864
He stopped.

261
00:25:51.161 --> 00:25:53.997
You should listen to your parents
when you grow up.

262
00:25:54.873 --> 00:25:56.750
To be a good boy. OK?

263
00:25:59.169 --> 00:26:01.087
When'll you grow up?

264
00:26:48.093 --> 00:26:50.345
Are you Uncle Leung?

265
00:26:52.722 --> 00:26:53.974
My master told me

266
00:26:54.307 --> 00:26:57.185
his fellow brother. Leung Bik.
lives a free life and likes to tour.

267
00:26:58.853 --> 00:27:01.106
It's a pity
that my master never saw

268
00:27:01.314 --> 00:27:03.692
his fellow brother again
before passing away.

269
00:27:05.235 --> 00:27:07.612
I'm just an old drunkard...

270
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:09.281
that likes to tour around.

271
00:27:09.489 --> 00:27:11.616
Now. I'm Qiao Wu. living a free life.

272
00:27:11.825 --> 00:27:14.369
I don't deserve to be remembered
by your master.

273
00:27:15.161 --> 00:27:17.622
Why do you help me again and again.

274
00:27:17.831 --> 00:27:19.165
but are reluctant
to reveal your identity?

275
00:27:19.332 --> 00:27:20.709
I just wonder why the Wing Chun school

276
00:27:20.917 --> 00:27:23.795
has an apprentice like you
who's so obsessed with being a cop.

277
00:27:24.462 --> 00:27:26.298
A man with Kungfu
should serve his country and his people.

278
00:27:26.464 --> 00:27:29.050
In a chaotic time like nowadays.
Ip Man. an apprentice of Wing Chun.

279
00:27:29.217 --> 00:27:30.885
should definitely seek
that responsibility.

280
00:27:31.219 --> 00:27:32.887
You think
you're a qualified Wing Chun apprentice?

281
00:27:33.054 --> 00:27:35.348
Well. then. Let's battle.

282
00:27:35.765 --> 00:27:37.726
If you can make me leave the chair
in five moves.

283
00:27:37.934 --> 00:27:38.893
I'll admit that you win.

284
00:27:39.019 --> 00:27:40.854
Then. forgive my rudeness.

285
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.606
Garrulous...

286
00:28:03.543 --> 00:28:04.753
Nice move. young man!

287
00:28:06.129 --> 00:28:08.006
Uncle. let me be your apprentice.

288
00:28:08.214 --> 00:28:11.968
You've had Chan Wah-shun as your master.
you can't call me "master".

289
00:28:12.177 --> 00:28:14.804
But I can still teach you some moves.

290
00:28:15.931 --> 00:28:16.932
Thank you. uncle.

291
00:28:17.515 --> 00:28:18.600
Brother Man.

292
00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:23.897
We've found opium at ports.

293
00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:27.776
Uncle. please help me
take care of Wing-sing.

294
00:28:27.984 --> 00:28:29.027
I'll be back soon.

295
00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:30.445
Just go.

296
00:28:31.404 --> 00:28:32.364
Let's go.

297
00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:41.873
Brother Chan. you have a good apprentice.

298
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.380
It's opium.

299
00:28:49.756 --> 00:28:51.508
It belongs to the commerce chamber.

300
00:28:57.138 --> 00:28:59.391
You go to my home.
I'll go to the Axes Gang.

301
00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:00.558
OK.

302
00:29:03.561 --> 00:29:04.521
Slowly.

303
00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:06.231
Here we go.

304
00:29:19.327 --> 00:29:20.787
It's you. Why come back?

305
00:29:21.538 --> 00:29:24.374
Brother Man went to the Axes Gang.
He asked me to take care of the family.

306
00:29:25.208 --> 00:29:27.294
Why? He doesn't trust me?

307
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:28.753
He trusts you.

308
00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:36.428
Listen. everybody!

309
00:29:38.763 --> 00:29:39.723
Today.

310
00:29:40.557 --> 00:29:43.977
at the mourning hall of my father.
I'll make a new rule for the Axes.

311
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.691
Whoever kills Ip Man...
will be the next leader of the Axes!

312
00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:52.360
Is it that easy?

313
00:29:55.614 --> 00:29:57.032
I'm Sasaki.

314
00:29:58.158 --> 00:29:59.993
With the support of people
and businessmen in Foshan.

315
00:30:00.201 --> 00:30:02.245
I'm now the chairman
of Foshan Chamber of Commerce.

316
00:30:03.079 --> 00:30:04.039
Japanese?

317
00:30:04.873 --> 00:30:06.875
Japanese are not welcome here.

318
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.294
As the Chinese saying goes:

319
00:30:09.502 --> 00:30:11.338
"The dead should be respected.

320
00:30:11.546 --> 00:30:13.173
and those who mourn the dead
are all guests."

321
00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:15.467
Everyone here to mourn your father
is your guest.

322
00:30:16.134 --> 00:30:17.260
Miss Qingchuan.

323
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:20.722
why do you close the door to me?

324
00:30:28.146 --> 00:30:33.276
I never thought our first meeting
would be at your funeral.

325
00:30:34.736 --> 00:30:35.779
San Ye.

326
00:30:35.987 --> 00:30:39.366
I've something to discuss with you today.

327
00:30:40.033 --> 00:30:41.451
My father has said

328
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.746
that in Foshan
the Axes can do any business

329
00:30:45.538 --> 00:30:47.040
except opium.

330
00:30:49.084 --> 00:30:51.002
If you don't leave. Mr. Sasaki.

331
00:30:51.211 --> 00:30:53.129
we will have to force you to.

332
00:30:54.047 --> 00:30:56.383
Like father. like daughter.

333
00:30:57.968 --> 00:30:58.927
What a pity!

334
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:02.847
Your father refused our kindness.
so did you.

335
00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:08.520
Lao Si.

336
00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.564
time to clean the Axes!

337
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.427
You killed my father!

338
00:32:49.871 --> 00:32:50.830
Go!

339
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.626
Ask them to stop!

340
00:33:51.308 --> 00:33:53.518
Leave here!
Save your life and we can plan in future!

341
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.020
Go!

342
00:34:54.955 --> 00:34:57.874
The law I trusted didn't save San Ye.

343
00:34:58.667 --> 00:35:01.127
Today. I'll use San Ye's methods

344
00:35:01.336 --> 00:35:02.712
to seek justice for him!

345
00:35:05.423 --> 00:35:07.467
Can you sacrifice the lives
of your wife and son?

346
00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:15.725
My little baby. close your eyes.

347
00:35:16.935 --> 00:35:21.314
Mom is just by your side.

348
00:35:28.363 --> 00:35:31.283
The crescent moon is bright.

349
00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:34.160
the breeze is cool.

350
00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:40.083
the leaves dangle on the window lattice.

351
00:35:41.001 --> 00:35:46.840
The crickets sound.

352
00:35:47.591 --> 00:35:51.678
like the strings being played

353
00:35:53.555 --> 00:35:59.060
gently. with a beautiful tune.

354
00:36:00.228 --> 00:36:05.191
The cradle gently swings.

355
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:11.906
My little baby. close your eyes.

356
00:36:12.949 --> 00:36:16.202
Mom is just by your side.

357
00:36:25.712 --> 00:36:31.009
My little baby. close your eyes.

358
00:36:31.885 --> 00:36:36.681
Mom is just by your side.

359
00:36:44.898 --> 00:36:46.441
What about your life?

360
00:36:47.317 --> 00:36:48.568
What do you think?

361
00:36:57.744 --> 00:36:59.287
<i>Freeze! Don't move!</i>

362
00:37:00.664 --> 00:37:01.706
<i>Mr. Sasaki!</i>

363
00:37:03.124 --> 00:37:04.125
<i>Mr. Sasaki!</i>

364
00:37:08.964 --> 00:37:10.548
Sorry. Mr. Sasaki!

365
00:37:10.757 --> 00:37:13.134
Sorry. I'm late.

366
00:37:18.765 --> 00:37:19.724
Chief Yuan.

367
00:37:21.017 --> 00:37:23.603
you point the gun at your own man.

368
00:37:23.812 --> 00:37:25.230
This isn't acceptable.

369
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:29.192
If all Chinese were like you.
we'd only be trampled upon by others.

370
00:37:29.567 --> 00:37:32.612
Then how should a police chief act?

371
00:37:33.154 --> 00:37:34.239
You teach me.

372
00:37:35.782 --> 00:37:38.743
Or. you shoot me instead?

373
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.582
You don't dare?

374
00:37:45.417 --> 00:37:46.459
Officers!

375
00:37:46.751 --> 00:37:48.128
Take him away!

376
00:37:48.336 --> 00:37:49.379
You can't leave.

377
00:37:52.048 --> 00:37:52.882
Mr. Sasaki.

378
00:37:53.216 --> 00:37:55.844
I'm... I'm trying to save your life.

379
00:37:56.052 --> 00:37:58.305
Please be cooperative.

380
00:37:59.055 --> 00:38:00.640
Take him. Let's go.

381
00:38:00.849 --> 00:38:01.808
Yes. sir!

382
00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:19.409
You two! What're you doing here?

383
00:38:34.049 --> 00:38:34.883
Interesting.

384
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:46.728
<i>Ip Man. leave.</i>

385
00:38:47.854 --> 00:38:49.940
<i>I can only help you to this extent.</i>

386
00:39:17.259 --> 00:39:18.593
Ribby?
Where's Wing-sing?

387
00:39:21.388 --> 00:39:23.765
Madam is OK.
I'm back to pick up some stuff.

388
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:25.308
OK.

389
00:39:44.286 --> 00:39:46.329
My house is a little bit shabby.

390
00:39:46.538 --> 00:39:48.290
But at least it's a shelter
from winds and rains.

391
00:39:48.498 --> 00:39:49.916
We have to compromise.

392
00:39:52.168 --> 00:39:53.503
We troubled you. uncle.

393
00:39:59.092 --> 00:40:02.095
Wing-sing. the baby is crying.

394
00:40:18.194 --> 00:40:19.154
Brother Man.

395
00:40:19.988 --> 00:40:21.781
Brother Man.
Chief Yuan told you to leave.

396
00:40:22.198 --> 00:40:23.116
You're not leaving?

397
00:40:23.283 --> 00:40:24.701
Keep on watching the commerce chamber.

398
00:40:26.244 --> 00:40:27.579
Are you worrying for Qingchuan?

399
00:40:29.497 --> 00:40:30.457
The bottle's empty.

400
00:40:30.582 --> 00:40:31.750
- Are you worrying...
- Ribby...

401
00:40:32.292 --> 00:40:34.419
let's go get some wine.
Come on.

402
00:40:34.586 --> 00:40:35.545
Let's go.

403
00:41:01.404 --> 00:41:02.697
Wing-sing.

404
00:41:03.657 --> 00:41:04.658
I'm sorry...

405
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.035
to make you live here.

406
00:41:07.244 --> 00:41:08.703
All you care about is your work!

407
00:41:08.912 --> 00:41:10.372
It's been days since our son was born.

408
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.332
Have you ever thought about his name?

409
00:41:16.086 --> 00:41:17.796
I know a fortune-teller.

410
00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:21.216
What about we ask him
to choose a name for our baby tomorrow?

411
00:41:21.925 --> 00:41:23.635
I've found someone to offer names.

412
00:41:24.844 --> 00:41:27.180
The fortune-teller
suggested the character Chun.

413
00:41:28.431 --> 00:41:31.726
I hope. when he grows up.
he could be a man of principle

414
00:41:32.227 --> 00:41:34.020
and follow the rules.

415
00:41:35.981 --> 00:41:38.024
Nice. A Chun.

416
00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:39.693
It's a very good name.

417
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.698
I've prepared a gift for him.

418
00:41:44.906 --> 00:41:46.741
I don't know
whether he'll like it or not.

419
00:41:51.913 --> 00:41:52.872
Look.

420
00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.584
I'm not sure whether he likes
to practice with the wooden dummy.

421
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.377
Haven't you had enough
of all this fighting?

422
00:41:59.546 --> 00:42:01.840
I don't want our boy to be like you
when he grows up.

423
00:42:02.048 --> 00:42:03.341
to fight every day.

424
00:42:06.761 --> 00:42:08.430
It's my fault.

425
00:42:11.891 --> 00:42:13.018
I made you worry.

426
00:42:14.644 --> 00:42:16.396
I understand your duties.

427
00:42:17.272 --> 00:42:19.608
I used to support you...

428
00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:21.443
whenever and whatever.

429
00:42:22.152 --> 00:42:24.237
But now. I'm a mother.

430
00:42:25.822 --> 00:42:27.616
I hope you remember that...

431
00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:29.701
you are a father now.

432
00:42:44.215 --> 00:42:45.634
I'm sorry. Wing-sing.

433
00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:47.302
I'm sorry.

434
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:54.601
Let's leave here.

435
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:06.029
Being cool?

436
00:43:06.237 --> 00:43:07.197
Behave!

437
00:43:10.241 --> 00:43:11.660
You dare to fight back?

438
00:43:11.868 --> 00:43:12.827
Stop!

439
00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:14.996
Let him go!

440
00:43:17.749 --> 00:43:18.875
Who are you?

441
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.212
You dare to meddle in my affairs?

442
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.342
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

443
00:43:27.842 --> 00:43:28.802
You're cool.

444
00:43:38.812 --> 00:43:40.939
Extra! Extra!

445
00:43:41.147 --> 00:43:43.233
Commerce chamber's storehouses
caught on fire!

446
00:43:43.441 --> 00:43:44.401
Extra! Extra!

447
00:43:44.526 --> 00:43:47.904
<i>The commerce chamber smuggled opium
and harms our countrymen.</i>

448
00:43:48.113 --> 00:43:52.242
<i>An anonymous Black Knight appears
in Foshan!</i>

449
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.536
Commerce chamber's storehouses
were on fire!

450
00:43:54.744 --> 00:43:55.829
Extra! Extra!

451
00:43:57.914 --> 00:43:59.249
<i>"Black Knight" appears in Foshan!</i>

452
00:43:59.457 --> 00:44:01.626
<i>Commerce chamber's storehouses
were on fire!</i>

453
00:44:20.103 --> 00:44:21.313
They're coming!

454
00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:22.522
Here comes the car!

455
00:44:24.482 --> 00:44:25.442
Mr. Tokugawa!

456
00:44:25.692 --> 00:44:26.943
Mr. Tokugawa!

457
00:44:27.152 --> 00:44:28.278
Quick! Follow him!

458
00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:29.446
Hurry up!

459
00:44:30.697 --> 00:44:32.991
Mr. Tokugawa! Sir!

460
00:44:39.039 --> 00:44:40.457
Mr. Tokugawa!

461
00:44:50.884 --> 00:44:53.178
Hello. my Chinese friends.

462
00:44:53.595 --> 00:44:57.432
I'm Tokugawa.
a Major in the Japanese army.

463
00:44:57.807 --> 00:45:01.186
I've heard that Foshan
is a town of martial arts

464
00:45:01.394 --> 00:45:05.398
I'm here to organize an exchange event
for Chinese and Japanese martial arts

465
00:45:05.607 --> 00:45:09.110
to make friends with local Kungfu masters
through contests.

466
00:45:09.319 --> 00:45:14.366
I hope Kungfu masters in Foshan
can participate in it.

467
00:45:14.574 --> 00:45:15.450
Thank you.

468
00:45:15.659 --> 00:45:18.245
I know there are
Hong. Liu. Cai. Li. Mo...

469
00:45:18.453 --> 00:45:20.580
and dozens of other schools of Kungfu.

470
00:45:21.623 --> 00:45:23.583
Foshan has many local schools of Kungfu.

471
00:45:23.792 --> 00:45:27.128
but only a few masters can battle.

472
00:45:27.337 --> 00:45:30.340
They're no equal to our Karate.

473
00:45:30.924 --> 00:45:35.428
Mr. Tokugawa. you don't need to spend
much effort preparing for the contest.

474
00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:38.473
Our Empire shall rule the Chinese.

475
00:45:38.682 --> 00:45:39.933
We'll have them learn

476
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:43.561
from our extraordinary culture
and martial arts.

477
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:47.399
This is the purpose
of the exchange event.

478
00:45:47.607 --> 00:45:49.234
You're right. Mr. Tokugawa.

479
00:45:50.402 --> 00:45:54.406
But how can we rule
if we fail to control them?

480
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:58.952
The empire should send the military soon
to occupy Foshan.

481
00:45:59.494 --> 00:46:03.707
Mr. Sasaki. you've long been in China.

482
00:46:04.374 --> 00:46:05.542
Don't you understand why

483
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.544
we're still holding out
on the military option?

484
00:46:08.461 --> 00:46:10.380
You make sense. Mr. Tokugawa.

485
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.470
I believe you will ascend to fame
after the victory in Foshan.

486
00:46:17.679 --> 00:46:21.641
And you'll also raise the prestige
of our empire.

487
00:46:24.436 --> 00:46:25.437
Damn!

488
00:46:56.509 --> 00:46:57.469
Guards!

489
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:05.310
Your Kungfu is excellent.

490
00:47:06.102 --> 00:47:09.314
I'm Japanese army Major Tokugawa.

491
00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.817
We'll have a Kungfu exchange
in a few days.

492
00:47:13.026 --> 00:47:14.653
Hope to see you there.

493
00:47:15.987 --> 00:47:16.947
Let's go.

494
00:47:30.377 --> 00:47:32.212
Boy. get the medicine on this list.

495
00:47:40.345 --> 00:47:41.680
Don't worry. You're safe here.

496
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.181
You never know...

497
00:47:43.932 --> 00:47:44.808
Take a rest.

498
00:47:54.484 --> 00:47:55.819
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

499
00:48:00.824 --> 00:48:02.576
- I need these medicines.
- Here.

500
00:48:40.905 --> 00:48:42.407
You've taken the money.

501
00:48:42.616 --> 00:48:44.868
You can't do anything in return.

502
00:48:46.036 --> 00:48:46.995
My bad. Mr. Sasaki!

503
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:50.749
I know the whereabouts
of Qingchuan and Ip Man.

504
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.960
And I also know who the Black Knight is.

505
00:48:54.169 --> 00:48:56.755
You're much smarter than Ip Man.

506
00:48:59.549 --> 00:49:02.594
Come here. I'll give you a present.

507
00:49:21.196 --> 00:49:23.198
This is my present for you.

508
00:49:25.283 --> 00:49:27.911
You or him. only one can survive.

509
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:29.871
Now. choose.

510
00:50:05.782 --> 00:50:08.201
You'll be the next police chief.

511
00:50:20.755 --> 00:50:22.882
Miss Qingchuan doesn't need this.

512
00:50:23.341 --> 00:50:28.013
You know I'm not coming for her.

513
00:50:30.557 --> 00:50:33.810
Captain Ip. you really aren't
afraid of death. are you?

514
00:50:37.314 --> 00:50:39.316
Not every Chinese fears to die.

515
00:50:41.735 --> 00:50:44.070
Well. then. if you're right.

516
00:50:44.988 --> 00:50:48.950
tomorrow.
the day when San Ye would be buried.

517
00:50:49.576 --> 00:50:53.788
I'll kill him all over again.

518
00:51:00.211 --> 00:51:01.755
Will the Black Knight...

519
00:51:02.797 --> 00:51:05.050
save a dead man?

520
00:51:11.014 --> 00:51:12.182
Perhaps he will.

521
00:51:18.563 --> 00:51:19.564
I forgot to tell you.

522
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.984
Chief Yuan died mysteriously.

523
00:51:23.693 --> 00:51:25.904
The case is being investigated.

524
00:51:32.077 --> 00:51:33.203
Take your medicine.

525
00:52:09.364 --> 00:52:12.325
Tomorrow.
if the Black Knight does come.

526
00:52:12.534 --> 00:52:14.619
he'll definitely be beaten to death.

527
00:52:15.245 --> 00:52:17.706
There will be no more Black Knight
in Foshan or ever again.

528
00:52:18.248 --> 00:52:19.624
<i>I promise.</i>

529
00:53:10.842 --> 00:53:11.885
In one month.

530
00:53:12.844 --> 00:53:14.679
you come to pick us up in person.

531
00:53:15.305 --> 00:53:16.348
I promise.

532
00:53:53.718 --> 00:53:54.803
Cheers. uncle.

533
00:53:59.516 --> 00:54:01.226
I'm a lonely and old man...

534
00:54:01.685 --> 00:54:03.436
It's rare to have someone
drink together with me.

535
00:54:03.645 --> 00:54:05.814
Let's enjoy it tonight.
Come on.

536
00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:06.940
OK.

537
00:54:07.065 --> 00:54:08.358
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

538
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:23.039
Uncle. have another bowl.

539
00:54:34.259 --> 00:54:35.302
Nice wine.

540
00:54:40.515 --> 00:54:42.809
Single-hand-lock.
like catching the fog in the clouds.

541
00:54:43.268 --> 00:54:45.478
Double-hand-lock.
use it to catch your rival's neck.

542
00:54:46.396 --> 00:54:48.398
The first move of Wing Chun:
swift inchpunch.

543
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:49.649
Nice!

544
00:55:10.128 --> 00:55:11.421
Good. Next:

545
00:55:12.422 --> 00:55:14.549
Multiple powerful punches
take the form of a dragon.

546
00:55:28.271 --> 00:55:30.357
Lingering like water. covering
a wide range like the wind blows.

547
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.759
My wine...

548
00:56:02.597 --> 00:56:04.349
Stick to your rival to attack.

549
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:34.439
I failed to stop my father
when he decided to leave with you.

550
00:57:35.774 --> 00:57:37.067
And now he's dead.

551
00:57:39.819 --> 00:57:41.571
He used to say

552
00:57:42.781 --> 00:57:44.950
that it's not important when we die.

553
00:57:46.117 --> 00:57:47.994
but how we live.

554
00:57:55.001 --> 00:57:56.544
I didn't understand it before.

555
00:57:59.798 --> 00:58:00.882
Now I do.

556
00:58:08.556 --> 00:58:11.643
The Black Knight has to die to get
people united and arouse their morale.

557
00:58:11.851 --> 00:58:14.479
Uncle Leung's death
would be very meaningful.

558
00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:19.359
He asked me to pass his words to you:

559
00:58:21.194 --> 00:58:24.614
"To live is harder than to die."

560
00:58:28.159 --> 00:58:31.580
I just want to say goodbye to him
for the last time.

561
00:58:55.312 --> 00:58:57.063
My kid!

562
00:59:45.904 --> 00:59:49.491
I am the new police chief in Foshan.

563
00:59:50.742 --> 00:59:52.244
San Ye. the leader of the Axes Gang.

564
00:59:52.369 --> 00:59:54.204
tried to sabotage the friendship
between China and Japan.

565
00:59:54.329 --> 00:59:56.122
and stand in the way
of building a harmonious East Asia.

566
00:59:56.957 --> 00:59:59.751
To avoid being punished by law.

567
01:00:00.043 --> 01:00:02.254
San Ye killed himself in jail.

568
01:00:03.046 --> 01:00:05.090
But law is law.

569
01:00:05.507 --> 01:00:08.176
He can't shake off his liability
with his death.

570
01:00:08.635 --> 01:00:12.764
Today. he will be executed.

571
01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:14.391
Soldiers!

572
01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:15.475
Here!

573
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:17.852
Start execution!

574
01:00:28.446 --> 01:00:30.156
- Mom!
- My Boy!

575
01:00:33.243 --> 01:00:34.703
San Ye died standing.

576
01:00:35.328 --> 01:00:37.038
Such humiliation is unacceptable!

577
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.249
Hold on.

578
01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:43.086
Mr. Sasaki. I will handle this.

579
01:00:49.426 --> 01:00:50.760
You Chinese

580
01:00:51.052 --> 01:00:53.305
only dare to hide behind a mask?

581
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.850
Better than those who dig up
and desecrate others' ancestral graves.

582
01:01:15.327 --> 01:01:17.120
San Ye. I'll help you to stand!

583
01:01:58.411 --> 01:02:01.915
San Ye. don't worry. I'm here.

584
01:02:55.802 --> 01:03:00.432
<i>We Chinese would rather die
than surrender.</i>

585
01:04:09.084 --> 01:04:10.377
Uncle. thank you for teaching me.

586
01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:12.212
Please accept me as your apprentice.

587
01:04:14.965 --> 01:04:16.424
I don't have the honor.

588
01:04:16.925 --> 01:04:18.635
I'd rather continue to be your uncle.

589
01:04:20.679 --> 01:04:22.430
Living in such a chaotic time.

590
01:04:23.515 --> 01:04:26.601
one has few options.

591
01:04:32.107 --> 01:04:33.233
Master...

592
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.598
REST IN PEACE

593
01:05:55.857 --> 01:05:59.819
Mr. Tokugawa came to Foshan to have
this martial arts exchange meeting.

594
01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:03.698
After all these days.
no one even dares to enter the contest.

595
01:06:04.324 --> 01:06:07.786
The Foshan Kungfu world
might be overrated.

596
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:12.332
I think we can cancel the event.

597
01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:14.417
Wait!

598
01:06:17.921 --> 01:06:18.880
It's Mr. Ip.

599
01:06:19.005 --> 01:06:20.090
Mr. Ip! Mr. Ip!

600
01:06:29.516 --> 01:06:30.809
I'm entering the contest.

601
01:06:31.017 --> 01:06:32.310
Mr. Ip wants to challenge the Japanese?

602
01:06:32.477 --> 01:06:33.436
Please.

603
01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:56.543
Extra! Extra!

604
01:06:56.668 --> 01:06:58.044
China and Japan
hold martial arts contest!

605
01:06:58.211 --> 01:06:59.796
Ip Man will participate in it
as the Black Knight.

606
01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:02.132
He'll rival
the Japanese Karate master. Tokugawa!

607
01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.466
Extra! Extra!

608
01:07:04.593 --> 01:07:06.136
<i>China and Japan
hold martial arts contest!</i>

609
01:07:06.344 --> 01:07:07.804
<i>Ip Man will join in
as the Black Knight...</i>

610
01:07:13.852 --> 01:07:15.645
Brother Man. Tea.

611
01:07:34.289 --> 01:07:35.749
Mr. Ip. look here. please.

612
01:07:35.957 --> 01:07:37.626
One. two. three.

613
01:09:16.516 --> 01:09:17.392
Be careful. It's hot.

614
01:09:32.574 --> 01:09:34.826
You Chinese are so interesting.

615
01:09:35.827 --> 01:09:37.412
A Black Knight fell down.

616
01:09:37.621 --> 01:09:38.996
and here comes another one.

617
01:09:39.371 --> 01:09:41.041
I thought you Chinese...

618
01:09:41.708 --> 01:09:43.251
were all spineless.

619
01:09:43.793 --> 01:09:45.336
It's not only me.

620
01:09:46.254 --> 01:09:48.005
Many others also have strength.

621
01:09:57.682 --> 01:10:01.269
This contest is for boosting exchanges

622
01:10:01.603 --> 01:10:04.314
and the friendship
between China and Japan.

623
01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:08.068
It's for both to learn from each other
and make friends.

624
01:10:08.401 --> 01:10:09.361
Start!

625
01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.621
How strange!

626
01:11:01.997 --> 01:11:03.582
The poison on Ip
should have taken effect.

627
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:05.417
Why is he still that active?

628
01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:06.960
You're more cunning than Yuan.

629
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.173
Mr. Sasaki. the poison...

630
01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:14.843
I now give you some more.

631
01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:20.015
Since you're reluctant to poison Ip.

632
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.351
this will be for you.

633
01:11:34.404 --> 01:11:35.488
Mr. Sasaki...

634
01:12:13.109 --> 01:12:17.238
Mr. Sasaki. do you believe
that Ip Man will definitely win?

635
01:12:25.747 --> 01:12:26.790
Ribby!

636
01:12:44.516 --> 01:12:45.475
Ip Man.

637
01:12:46.559 --> 01:12:48.103
A true martial artist

638
01:12:48.895 --> 01:12:52.315
should not be disturbed during a fight.

639
01:12:53.024 --> 01:12:54.109
A martial artist?

640
01:12:55.235 --> 01:12:56.569
Do Japanese fighters

641
01:12:57.028 --> 01:12:58.738
only know these nasty tricks?

642
01:13:01.283 --> 01:13:03.326
Fine. I'll play with you.

643
01:13:26.099 --> 01:13:27.309
Get the others ready.

644
01:13:27.434 --> 01:13:28.351
Yes. sir.

645
01:14:00.842 --> 01:14:02.886
Bravo! Well done!

646
01:14:07.599 --> 01:14:10.018
Well done. Mr. Ip!

647
01:14:10.226 --> 01:14:11.311
Bravo!

648
01:14:13.355 --> 01:14:15.065
Mr. Ip lifts up our spirit.

649
01:14:17.275 --> 01:14:18.443
Protect Mr. Ip!

650
01:14:18.652 --> 01:14:20.111
Mr. Ip!

651
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.363
Don't harm Mr. Ip!

652
01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:25.283
Mr. Ip. we shall protect you.

653
01:14:35.543 --> 01:14:36.586
Good!

654
01:14:51.893 --> 01:14:54.229
<i>You or him. only one can survive.</i>

655
01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:56.147
<i>Now. choose.</i>

656
01:15:00.735 --> 01:15:01.695
You're still alive?

657
01:15:06.324 --> 01:15:08.034
Brother Man. your tea.

658
01:15:11.705 --> 01:15:13.665
Chief Yuan. let's do it.

659
01:15:39.274 --> 01:15:44.237
Sasaki. I've been putting up with you
for a long time.

660
01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:47.157
Be clear.

661
01:15:48.074 --> 01:15:49.159
You're in China!

662
01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:51.077
China! China!

663
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.682
"In honor of His Majesty.

664
01:16:13.308 --> 01:16:15.977
we hold this competition."

665
01:16:19.689 --> 01:16:21.107
Mr. Tokugawa said

666
01:16:21.524 --> 01:16:25.445
that he'd make the Chinese learn
from our culture and martial arts.

667
01:16:27.864 --> 01:16:29.366
But you lost.

668
01:16:31.243 --> 01:16:32.369
Yes. I lost.

669
01:16:46.007 --> 01:16:49.678
I'll kill myself as penance.

670
01:16:50.553 --> 01:16:57.477
Sasaki. you don't hold the spirit
of Japanese Bushido.

671
01:16:58.687 --> 01:17:01.231
You don't deserve to be Japanese.

672
01:17:06.361 --> 01:17:07.487
Tokugawa.

673
01:17:08.697 --> 01:17:09.656
wait.

674
01:17:27.716 --> 01:17:28.675
You...

675
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:47.736
Tokugawa.

676
01:17:48.403 --> 01:17:51.406
There's an old saying in China that goes:

677
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:54.993
"Though death befalls all men alike.

678
01:17:56.077 --> 01:17:58.955
it may be weightier than a mountain.

679
01:17:59.164 --> 01:18:01.416
or lighter than a feather."

680
01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:07.505
It's all because of those Chinese.

681
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.886
I promise.

682
01:18:14.346 --> 01:18:16.598
I'll make your death heavier...

683
01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:20.727
than a mountain.

684
01:19:15.115 --> 01:19:16.324
Miss Qingchuan.

685
01:19:17.617 --> 01:19:19.244
Even if I died.

686
01:19:20.036 --> 01:19:21.204
Foshan

687
01:19:22.914 --> 01:19:26.751
will be part of Japan one day.

688
01:20:50.043 --> 01:20:51.002
Charge!

689
01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:52.629
Go!

690
01:21:22.784 --> 01:21:23.743
<i>Kungfu.</i>

691
01:21:24.869 --> 01:21:26.788
<i>Why do we practice it?</i>
