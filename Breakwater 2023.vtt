18
00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.525
and men who had given up?

19
00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:03.008
Just make your damn wish.

20
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:04.793
I'll save it

30
00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:55.757
I know. I said I never met
the right person...

As far as she knows.
I...I might be dead.

35
00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:08.335
I didn't know whether uh...
If she was still

36
00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:10.511
in Virginia or even the country.

37
00:04:10.598 --> 00:04:12.077

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.133
It's the mast of an old
shipwreck off the Outer Banks.

Oh. thanks. Pops.

182
00:12:10.294 --> 00:12:12.427
Hey. careful there.

183
00:12:15.952 --> 00:12:20.435
- Go ahead. let it out.

184
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:21.566
That's a fat haul.

185
00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:23.003
We can boil some tonight.

186
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.395
That's good money in there.

187
00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:27.094
Ah. no. we gonna
celebrate tonight.

188
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:28.748
Not every day you get out.

189
00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:39.802
I'd of come for you but...

190
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:43.197
My truck motor
went out a month ago.

191
00:12:43.284 --> 00:12:44.372
That's okay.

192
00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.074
I missed you. boy.

193
00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:54.121
And they took you
for no good reason.

194
00:12:56.688 --> 00:12:58.125
I guess they
found reason enough.

195
00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:04.827
Anyway...

196
00:13:04.914 --> 00:13:06.046
Welcome home.

197
00:13:12.313 --> 00:13:13.270
Come here. bitch.

198
00:13:16.273 --> 00:13:18.232
Eyes down. Fish.

199
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.581
You don't wanna be a witness.

200
00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:30.026
About time you got up.

201
00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:32.594
You gotta be there in an hour.

202
00:13:34.465 --> 00:13:35.510
Here. I got you something.

203
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:38.600
Try it on.

204
00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:48.175
Yeah. that's sharp.

205
00:13:49.654 --> 00:13:50.655
First impressions. right?

206
00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:52.483
Yeah.

207
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.876
Who's your parole officer?

208
00:13:53.963 --> 00:13:56.270
- Bonnie Bell.
- Bonnie Bell.

209
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:57.706
Sounds like a sweet
little ol' granny.

210
00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:14.288
Dovey. huh?

211
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.985
Since I was 12.

212
00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:17.769
You know how a name
that's meant to hurt

213
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.075
and you claim it for your own.

214
00:14:19.162 --> 00:14:20.729
Hm.

215
00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:22.557
- You staying with your dad?
- Yes. ma'am.

216
00:14:22.644 --> 00:14:24.211
Well. it's a small place.
I'm on the couch.

217
00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.126
You're working for him too. huh?

218
00:14:26.213 --> 00:14:29.694
I did back in high school too
before. um. you know.

219
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:31.305
up until what happened.

220
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:33.133
What happened?

221
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.569
What you did.

222
00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.310
Active.

223
00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:37.746
Best to start using the language
of accountability.

224
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:41.881
Yes. ma'am.

225
00:14:41.968 --> 00:14:43.012
You know you're
not allowed to live

226
00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.057
with a convicted felon. right?

227
00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:45.841
I know.

228
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.278
But exceptions have been made
if it's a family member

229
00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:50.585
with a clean record
of ten years or more.

230
00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:53.240
I looked it up.

231
00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:55.068
Looked it up?

232
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:01.161
Suppose it's better
than a Cell Block Six.

233
00:15:01.248 --> 00:15:02.858
Cell Block Six?

234
00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:05.426
A pay-by-the-week motel
filled with guys like you

235
00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:06.688
killing time
until their next bid.

236
00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:09.082
That's not me.

237
00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:12.302
Listen. hon. I give you a list
of rules. you follow them

238
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:13.738
to the letter Z.

239
00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:16.045
You do that and you'll
stay a free man.

240
00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:21.398
Ma'am. all respect.
but I plan to. active.

241
00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:25.533
save every penny and get
myself into Tidewater College

242
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.187
next spring.

243
00:15:29.754 --> 00:15:30.799
You got a cell phone?

244
00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:33.280
Yeah. Uh. yes. ma'am.

245
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:36.326
Put the number down here.

246
00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:38.415
Keep it paid up.
Always take my call.

247
00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:41.723
Oh. one thing. um...

248
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.855
I'd like to go see
a buddy some weekend soon.

249
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.075
He's down the coast
near Currituck.

250
00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:48.382
He used to come up and lifeguard
with me in the summers.

251
00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:50.079
- He got a record?
- No.

252
00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:52.212
No. he doesn't even drink.

253
00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:53.691
Well. tell him make like
old times and come up here

254
00:15:53.778 --> 00:15:55.389
and see you.

255
00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:57.130
You can't leave the state
of Virginia for a year.

256
00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:00.916
Not even for a weekend?

257
00:16:01.003 --> 00:16:06.052
Hon. not even for a hurricane.

258
00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.792
That's bullshit.

259
00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:10.360
That's just your PO
trying to control you.

260
00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:12.884
She'll make you think if you
fart at the wrong time of day

261
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.843
you'll be back in here
before you smell it.

262
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.279
I don't know. man.

263
00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:18.629
She was pretty damn clear.

264
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.109
<i>She didn't put a collar
on you. did she?</i>

265
00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:21.893
- No.
- So...

266
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.983
Say you're going up to Roanoke
to look at that school.

267
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.941
<i>I hear you.</i>

268
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:29.118
What about everything you taught
me about risk and reward?

269
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:31.991
<i>- Look. after a year--</i>
- I ain't got a year.

270
00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:33.427
<i>What?</i>

271
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:36.473
Uh...

272
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.086
Well. you know that back pain
that's been bothering me

273
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:41.696
<i>the last couple months?</i>

274
00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:43.437
What is it. Ray?

275
00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:47.832
It's in the bone. son.

276
00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:51.662
They say the cancer is all up in
my spine like rot in a tree.

277
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:53.403
Jesus. Ray. when did you--

278
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.970
<i>Virginia Department
of Corrections.</i>

279
00:16:55.057 --> 00:16:56.711
<i>This call may be
recorded or monitored.</i>

280
00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:58.234
Now you listen to me.
I've only got about ten seconds.

281
00:16:58.321 --> 00:16:59.670
So would you listen?
I need this.

282
00:16:59.757 --> 00:17:01.498
<i>I never did right by her</i>

283
00:17:01.585 --> 00:17:04.284
<i>and it's the most
I ever tried at anything.</i>

284
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:05.763
<i>If she's happy. well.
it'll help me</i>

285
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:06.721
<i>accept this other thing.</i>

286
00:17:06.808 --> 00:17:08.592
You understand?

287
00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:12.118
Childress. time's up.

288
00:17:13.423 --> 00:17:14.642
- I gotta go.
<i>- Ray...</i>

289
00:17:16.992 --> 00:17:18.080
You can sleep easy.

290
00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.693
Thank you. son.

291
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.608
<i>Do what the doctors tell you.</i>

292
00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:26.132
<i>Hell. they've got all kinds
of ways of fighting-</i>

293
00:17:30.614 --> 00:17:35.271
Miss your little
beeyotch shadow. Ray?

294
00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:37.099
Hell yeah.

295
00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:39.406
Uh. but maybe not as much
as you long for the smell

296
00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:40.407
of your sister's panocha.

297
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:45.499
But they say smell's the
strongest of the sense memories.

298
00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:50.808
Did I get that word wrong?

299
00:17:50.895 --> 00:17:52.593
Panocha?

300
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.030
- It's like a Mexican soufflé.
- Shut the fuck up. Ray.

301
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.423
'Cause they only got those
European Spanish books

302
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.381
in the library

303
00:17:58.468 --> 00:18:00.383
so I've had to pick up your
Mexican-Spanish idiosyncrasies

304
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.819
just along the way.

305
00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:03.473
Po-tay-to. po-tah-to.

306
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.866
Papa. Patata.

307
00:18:04.953 --> 00:18:06.041
Right. Cheech-o?

308
00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:09.262
You're so smart you're stupid.

309
00:18:14.354 --> 00:18:15.877
You're not out a week
and you're already

310
00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:17.139
running off
in the middle of the night.

311
00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:18.401
There's nothing to this.

312
00:18:18.488 --> 00:18:19.881
- A guy I know--
- A guy inside.

313
00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:21.187
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

314
00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:23.058
- He's inside for good.
- Yeah.

315
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:25.104
He's sick and he's trying to
reach out to some family--

316
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:26.583
He can't afford a stamp?

317
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:33.634
Son. I had to start over too.

318
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:35.157
Know what I did when I got out?

319
00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:37.942
I kept my head
down and I worked.

320
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:40.423
I took care of you
and sometimes.

321
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.121
sometimes. I slept.

322
00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.732
I couldn't afford to fuck up.

323
00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:46.647
Look. I made a promise.

324
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:49.519
How many have
you made and not kept?

325
00:18:49.606 --> 00:18:51.173
Only one.

326
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.435
But she broke hers too.

327
00:18:52.522 --> 00:18:54.220
Well. she broke more than one.

328
00:18:54.307 --> 00:18:56.135
Hey...

329
00:18:56.222 --> 00:18:58.963
How easy do you think it was for
your mom when I went away...

330
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.704
With her big dreams
and aspirations and...

331
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:03.229
Me locked up up in prison.

332
00:19:03.316 --> 00:19:05.187
We all did our time.

333
00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:06.449
Even her.

334
00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:10.497
Eat those scallops if you want.

335
00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:12.629
I'll be back before low tide.

336
00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:14.065
Day after tomorrow.

337
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.111
I promise.

338
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:17.678
Hey.

339
00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:28.515
Here.

340
00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:31.344
Don't run outta gas.

341
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:33.955
Thanks. Pops.

342
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.836
You got two minutes.

343
00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:33.841
Six thirty-three...
Six thirty-four...

344
00:20:33.928 --> 00:20:35.973
Six thirty-five...

345
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:39.238
Six thirty-six...

346
00:20:45.592 --> 00:20:47.158
Why are you always counting?

347
00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:50.684
This is meditative.

348
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:54.296
Like sheep over the fence.

349
00:20:54.383 --> 00:20:55.428
You didn't say nothing
about bringing

350
00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:56.951
his family into this.

351
00:20:57.038 --> 00:20:59.388
Ha! With that panocha jab?

352
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:00.998
Hell. I was just fishing on him

353
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:02.478
and I didn't even know
Cheech had a sister.

354
00:21:02.565 --> 00:21:03.479
Listen. ese...

355
00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:05.133
I ain't your ese.

356
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.963
No. yeah. well. okay.

357
00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:21.758
In fact. maybe I'm rethinking
this whole crazy-ass idea.

358
00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:30.724
Who am I in this place?

359
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:32.203
What?

360
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.640
How do people see me?

361
00:21:35.468 --> 00:21:37.034
Just a broken down
old professor.

362
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.953
Yeah. well. I didn't finish high
school so thank you. Luis.

363
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.825
Who's Cheech Dorado?

364
00:21:44.912 --> 00:21:47.436
Cheech is king.

365
00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:49.220
And who are you?

366
00:21:55.444 --> 00:21:56.576
Huh?

367
00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:03.931
What's the one part of a king
you can't armor. Lou-eece?

368
00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:08.152
His pride.

369
00:22:10.154 --> 00:22:11.852
Now. I'm not gonna
be here that much longer.

370
00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:13.810
But. what. you got
12 more years?

371
00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:17.161
Fifteen.

372
00:22:17.248 --> 00:22:19.250
You wanna make
a name for yourself?

373
00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.818
You wanna have a name...

374
00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:24.343
Maybe even get a rank
in this concrete kingdom?

375
00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.216
This is how.

376
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.311
Okay.

377
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:39.009
No more of the family shit.

378
00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.620
That dude's gonna
kill you for real.

379
00:22:42.273 --> 00:22:43.666
Claro.

380
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:33.237
That's an
interesting theory.

381
00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:35.675
So they're airlifted in.
whole damn thing.

382
00:23:35.762 --> 00:23:37.241
Dead of night.

383
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:39.809
Sink it like
a goddamn dock piling.

384
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:42.638
We wake up the next day.
think it's another old bucket

385
00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:45.511
- churned up by a storm.

386
00:23:45.598 --> 00:23:47.121
We're gawking
at a shipwreck the government

387
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.036
put there for us to gawk at.

388
00:23:49.123 --> 00:23:51.342
Meanwhile across the sound
they are surveying

389
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.475
egret nesting lands to mow over

390
00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:56.043
and build a weather base
so they can--and Jim Baird

391
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.394
at the post office. he confirmed
this--to seed clouds

392
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:01.396
with silver iodide
to make our hurricanes worse.

393
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:02.919
- Huh?

394
00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:05.269
To get us on board
with the climate agenda.

395
00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:07.663
I mean. it is a classic misdirection.

396
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.186
Yeah.

397
00:24:09.273 --> 00:24:10.187
That's just more
of that gibberish.

398
00:24:10.274 --> 00:24:11.537
You can't keep talking--

399
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:12.929
You think
I'm full of crap?

400
00:24:13.016 --> 00:24:14.496
I'm telling you.
when the shit goes down.

401
00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:16.280
you're gonna come
knocking at my door.

402
00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:20.241
Coffee?

403
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:21.677
I just brewed a pot.

404
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:29.076
Best to pick one
and just lock on.

405
00:24:29.163 --> 00:24:31.557
Sorry. I'm...
I'm just waking up.

406
00:24:31.644 --> 00:24:32.993
Maybe I do need a coffee.

407
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.131
Sugar? Cream?

408
00:24:41.218 --> 00:24:42.481
Um. black's okay.

409
00:24:49.836 --> 00:24:50.837
Straight now?

410
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:53.709
Perfectly. thanks.

411
00:25:01.848 --> 00:25:03.240
You've seen this. I guess.

412
00:25:05.242 --> 00:25:06.853
You a true believer?

413
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.898
In what?

414
00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:11.335
One of them folks thinks it's
a sign from God or something.

415
00:25:11.422 --> 00:25:12.859
They're all camped out
behind the church

416
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:15.165
Waiting for... Whatever.

417
00:25:15.252 --> 00:25:18.212
No. I just... I lost touch
with a friend of mine.

418
00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:20.562
I think this--
I think it might be her.

419
00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:21.781
- What's her name?
- Marina.

420
00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:23.173
Hold on.

421
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.914
Hey. y'all know
a girl named Marina?

422
00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:26.568
He says she's in the picture.

423
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:27.700
Oh. the picture.

424
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.268
- That's Eve.
- Who?

425
00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:34.315
Eve. she... She owns
The White Whale. the bookstore

426
00:25:34.402 --> 00:25:35.577
down at the end of Pinecroft.

427
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.277
These fools.
they don't read anymore...

428
00:25:40.364 --> 00:25:41.844
Unless it's on the internet.

429
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:43.498
- That's Eve all right.

430
00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:45.021
Sweet girl.

431
00:25:45.108 --> 00:25:47.676
Sorry. fella. I...
I don't know no Marina.

432
00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:48.677
Thank you.

433
00:25:48.764 --> 00:25:49.852
See ya. Kurt.

434
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:51.114
So long.

435
00:25:53.203 --> 00:25:54.640
Which way is Pinecroft?

00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:59.775

00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:41.034
Not this time. skippa.

443
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:43.906
My turtle's got you surrounded.

444
00:26:45.473 --> 00:26:46.909
- Hi.

445
00:26:46.996 --> 00:26:47.954
Oh...

446
00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:49.216
Who's this?

447
00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:51.784
My turtle.

448
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:54.003
I didn't know turtles could fly.

449
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.265
They can't.

450
00:26:55.352 --> 00:26:56.310
He would've been dead.

451
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:03.143
She's very literal...
Even in her imagination.

452
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.928
Sorry. they just delivered the
new Jacqueline Cinder novel.

453
00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:08.104
It's like gold around here.

454
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:10.150
I always expect
an armored car to pull up.

455
00:27:10.237 --> 00:27:12.108
Oh. a page-turner.

456
00:27:12.195 --> 00:27:14.502
Eh. I don't really have the
sweet tooth for beach novels.

457
00:27:14.589 --> 00:27:17.679
but the owner loves
a Jackie Cinder year.

458
00:27:17.766 --> 00:27:19.115
Doubles the customers.

459
00:27:19.202 --> 00:27:21.770
And he's not here
for the big day?

460
00:27:21.857 --> 00:27:24.077
Oh. uh. <i>she.</i>

461
00:27:24.164 --> 00:27:25.905
She's out marketing.

462
00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:27.471
How's that?

463
00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:30.170
She gives these
tours at the lighthouse.

464
00:27:30.257 --> 00:27:32.781
She works in the novel.
drops a couple cards.

465
00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:35.001
and I wait for the onslaught.

466
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:37.917
Are you looking
for something special?

467
00:27:38.004 --> 00:27:38.918
Browsing.

468
00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:41.007
A friend sent me by.

469
00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:45.359
Oh. well. look around
and thank your friend.

470
00:27:45.446 --> 00:27:47.274
We can always use
some more customers

471
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:49.624
at the edge of nowhere.

472
00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:27.270
Does anyone know when
this lighthouse was built?

473
00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:31.840
So the tower
stands at 162 feet.

474
00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:35.061
The walls are
five-feet wide down here.

475
00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:37.193
three-feet wide at the top.

476
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.414
One million bricks make up the
cylinder you're in right now.

477
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:41.981
Did you hear this?

478
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.678
We get a lot
of storms on the island.

479
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:47.334
but none in a 147 years
has huffed and puffed enough

480
00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:49.249
to blow this bad boy down.

481
00:28:55.472 --> 00:28:57.344
What is that?

482
00:28:57.431 --> 00:28:59.650
It looks like a ship.

483
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:03.611
That out there may
not be a sign from God...

484
00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:05.395
But she is pretty special.

485
00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:07.441
She showed herself
after a recent storm

486
00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:10.487
and what you see
is about all we know so far.

487
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:13.969
Just a ship that
could've used a lighthouse.

488
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:21.455
A friend of mine
read an advance copy

489
00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:23.849
and said it's her best.

490
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:25.328
- White Whale bookstore.
- Thank you.

491
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:26.852
I'll see you there.
- You bet.

492
00:29:27.722 --> 00:29:29.724
Eve.

493
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:31.813
Thanks for the history lesson.

494
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.294
Oh. I...I hope
it was a little interesting.

495
00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:39.952
Well. that shipwreck.
I love that kind of stuff.

496
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:41.954
And it's still a mystery?

497
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.391
They haven't ID'd her yet.

498
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:45.740
A nautical Jane Doe.

499
00:29:47.698 --> 00:29:50.789
Yeah. some divers came up
from the college in Greenville.

500
00:29:50.876 --> 00:29:54.227
but the currents around
the rocks beat 'em to shit.

501
00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:54.967
I mean...

502
00:29:55.054 --> 00:29:56.751
Yeah.

503
00:29:56.838 --> 00:29:59.058
Then. uh. a couple local kids
thought they'd play

504
00:29:59.145 --> 00:30:02.844
Treasure hunter and... Almost
Drowned so they buoyed it off.

505
00:30:02.931 --> 00:30:04.759
Oh that's a shame.

506
00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:08.110
Oh yeah?

507
00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:11.766
I mean. I'll be long gone
before the mystery is solved.

508
00:30:11.853 --> 00:30:13.289
Hmm.

509
00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:18.164
This is really your thing?

510
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:19.426
I grew up on the water.

511
00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:24.257
Would you like to see her?

512
00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:25.649
Oh. the boat?

513
00:30:25.736 --> 00:30:27.173
Ship.

514
00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.217
Ship.

515
00:30:28.304 --> 00:30:29.740
Yeah...

516
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.742
Yeah I would.

517
00:30:35.529 --> 00:30:36.965
Ow. dammit.

518
00:30:37.052 --> 00:30:38.184
The beach grass'll
cut you to pieces.

519
00:30:38.271 --> 00:30:39.707
but it holds the sea back.

520
00:30:39.794 --> 00:30:41.361
Otherwise the lighthouse
would be the only

521
00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:42.753
dry land around here.

522
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:50.849
Surreal.

523
00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:54.374
Come on. you've
got to see it closer.

524
00:31:19.442 --> 00:31:22.184
She was probably on her side.
buried in the sand

525
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:25.187
for a couple hundred years
before the storm.

526
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:31.498
Amazing how something can stay
hidden for so long.

527
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:34.370
Then in one night...

528
00:31:34.457 --> 00:31:37.069
Want to know what I think...

529
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:39.201
That's not a part of my tour?

530
00:31:39.288 --> 00:31:40.289
That's why I'm here.

531
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:44.685
I think that once they
finally do get down there.

532
00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:46.600
they're going to find
what's left of the captain

533
00:31:46.687 --> 00:31:50.125
and crew. shackled to chains by
the slaves they were carrying.

534
00:31:52.388 --> 00:31:53.824
Shit. let's go.

535
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.696
The tide swallows
these rocks in no time.

536
00:31:57.176 --> 00:31:58.438
Be careful.

537

Well. if she's happy.
me being far from her mind

577
00:34:45.213 --> 00:34:46.258

- How fast?
- What?

716
00:42:23.802 --> 00:42:26.108
Your speed.
What about your speed?

717
00:42:26.195 --> 00:42:27.893
- I. um...
- Come on.

718
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.242
Open roads. no traffic.

719
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:30.460
Fifty. Fifty-something.

720
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:32.027
Fifty? Fifty what? Do better.

721
00:42:32.114 --> 00:42:33.551
Uh. fif--fifty-eight
thereabouts.

722
00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:35.204
Fifty-eight miles an hour.
Fuck you. lady.

723
00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:36.728
This ain't a Sunday drive.

724
00:42:36.815 --> 00:42:38.556
I'm back here dying.

725
00:42:38.643 --> 00:42:41.602
No. I imagine 75
with lights and sirens.

726
00:42:41.689 --> 00:42:43.473
That leaves us three miles
from the service road.

727
00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:45.475
I wish I could shoot your ass.

728
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.699
But I need to shoot him.

729
00:42:51.786 --> 00:42:53.005
- Ray. wait.
- Wait. wait. wait--

730
00:42:59.011 --> 00:43:00.708
Aw. Justin. you'll
be all right. son.

731
00:43:00.795 --> 00:43:02.449
They'll patch you up.

732
00:43:02.536 --> 00:43:04.407
No better place to get
shot in than an ambulance.

733
00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:09.195
Especially if she drives
faster than 58 miles an hour.

734
00:43:30.956 --> 00:43:32.392
Guess it's too late
to drive back.

735
00:43:37.658 --> 00:43:38.877
Hey. slow down now.

736
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.492
Come on.

737
00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:47.625
What are you doing?

738
00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:52.455
Permission to come aboard.

739
00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:06.948
This is really your boat?

740
00:44:07.035 --> 00:44:08.515
No.

741
00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:10.517
I commandeered it.

742
00:45:09.968 --> 00:45:12.144
He said he had a friend in
Currituck he wanted to see.

743
00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:13.928
Do you think
he headed down there?

744
00:45:14.015 --> 00:45:16.975
Currituck's down on the Banks.

745
00:45:17.062 --> 00:45:20.065
Well. that's across state lines.

746
00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:21.936
He ain't allowed
across state lines. is he?

747
00:45:22.023 --> 00:45:24.547
No. he ain't.

748
00:45:24.634 --> 00:45:27.159
Well. there you are.

749
00:45:27.246 --> 00:45:29.814
Maybe he went to see his mother
up outside of D.C.

750
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:31.729
That's one trip
he wouldn't tell me about.

751
00:45:43.305 --> 00:45:44.393
See him?

752
00:45:45.917 --> 00:45:47.440
He ain't my chauffeur.

753
00:45:47.527 --> 00:45:50.095
Now. there's a manhunt
statewide for an escapee

754
00:45:50.182 --> 00:45:51.705
who was on the phone
with your son

755
00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:53.620
just hours before being
put into an ambulance

756
00:45:53.707 --> 00:45:56.318
a lot less dying than he looked.

757
00:45:56.405 --> 00:45:58.581
So tell Dovey to call.

758
00:45:58.668 --> 00:46:01.802
Officer Bell. my son
didn't even know me

759
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:04.805
until he was 12. but we
made up for lost time

760
00:46:04.892 --> 00:46:08.853
and now we gotta do it again.

761
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.247
Do you really think he'd go
and risk all that?

762
00:46:12.334 --> 00:46:14.162
Then have him call me.

763
00:46:14.249 --> 00:46:17.296
Even a failure to report can
land him back in St. Brides.

764
00:46:17.383 --> 00:46:19.298
He shouldn't have been there
in the first place.

765
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.267
Happy birthday.

766
00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:37.185
That's her. That's Marina.

767
00:46:39.622 --> 00:46:41.668
Go on. Go on. Make a wish.

768
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:55.377
He rises from the dead.

769
00:46:55.464 --> 00:46:58.554
- Oh... Hey.

770
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:00.469
I. uh. I had to get
home last night.

771
00:47:00.556 --> 00:47:02.645
but you were
sleeping so soundly.

772
00:47:02.732 --> 00:47:03.995
I didn't want to wake you.

773
00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:05.083
Thanks.

774
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.088
Okay.

775
00:47:10.175 --> 00:47:12.090
Well. get your sea legs under
you. we're taking her out.

776
00:47:26.495 --> 00:47:28.367
How you feeling?

777
00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:29.498
Awake.

778
00:47:36.157 --> 00:47:37.985
Your dad. he
gave you the bracelet?

779
00:47:39.987 --> 00:47:41.206
Sweet 16.

780
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:44.644
What's he like?

781
00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:47.647
Ah. when it gave me this.
he was the strongest man

782
00:47:47.734 --> 00:47:50.432
I'd ever known.

783
00:47:50.519 --> 00:47:52.521
A year later.
he was in a wheelchair.

784
00:47:54.262 --> 00:47:55.785
Next fall he was gone.

785
00:47:58.963 --> 00:47:59.964
Gone like...

786
00:48:01.487 --> 00:48:04.490
I haven't visited
his stone in...

787
00:48:04.577 --> 00:48:05.752
Seven years.

788
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.538
I mean. he wasn't perfect but...

789
00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:12.324
When I think of him now...

790
00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:13.629
He stands tall.

791
00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:21.811
Hey...

792
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:25.163
Sailor. it's a beautiful
fucking day. you know?

793
00:49:20.653 --> 00:49:21.828
Hey!

794
00:49:23.047 --> 00:49:24.091
Hello?

795
00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:29.662
Fella. what the hell
are you doing?

796
00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:32.491
Do I smell coffee?

797
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.756
Sugar and milk?

798
00:49:36.843 --> 00:49:38.105
Black please.

799
00:49:43.545 --> 00:49:44.982
So you're a doctor?

800
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:46.679
Well. a paramedic.

801
00:49:46.766 --> 00:49:48.724
We've been searching
in those woods back there

802
00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:51.249
all night for a little...
A lost girl.

803
00:49:51.336 --> 00:49:54.469
And then I...I got mixed up
in those briars something awful.

804
00:49:54.556 --> 00:49:55.688
Oh.

805
00:49:59.953 --> 00:50:01.911
- What are doing?
- Mm...

806
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:03.174
Good and strong.

807
00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:04.436
Strong chin. Strong chin.

808
00:50:04.523 --> 00:50:05.654
Shut up. birdbrain.

809
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:07.439
We've got company.

810
00:50:07.526 --> 00:50:08.831
The neighbor
who witnessed the ruckus

811
00:50:08.918 --> 00:50:10.746
told us what it was like--

812
00:50:10.833 --> 00:50:13.445
So you have not seen any kids
coming through your yard?

813
00:50:13.532 --> 00:50:16.535
You and the mailman are the only
folks I've seen in a month.

814
00:50:16.622 --> 00:50:18.754
Hope she's okay.

815
00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:21.714
It's dangerous
out there for kids nowadays.

816
00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:23.846
You almost gotta
keep them locked up.

817
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.024
Ow. you little shit.

818
00:50:27.111 --> 00:50:29.809
Little shit.
Doppler radar.

819
00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:31.724
- That's Quaker.
- Mm.

820
00:50:31.811 --> 00:50:35.380
My son bought him...
And then run off to California.

821
00:50:37.904 --> 00:50:40.950
His final... To his mama.

822
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.430
Little shit.

823
00:50:44.084 --> 00:50:46.652
I got to ride
in an ambulance once.

824
00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:48.262
Did you now?

825
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:52.440
Ended up just being gas.

826
00:50:53.963 --> 00:50:55.965
Better safe
than sorry. I reckon.

827
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.706
Hm.

828
00:50:57.793 --> 00:50:59.534
I was gonna wanna
patch myself up a little bit.

829
00:50:59.621 --> 00:51:02.102
Oh... Round the corner.
Second door.

830
00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:04.670
Thank you.

831
00:51:04.757 --> 00:51:06.498
You know. we're gonna have to
make you Samaritan of the Week

832
00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:08.717
down at the station.

833
00:51:15.115 --> 00:51:17.161
You ever let that bird out?

834
00:51:17.248 --> 00:51:19.163
Where's it got to go?

835
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.103
I have to get back to my store.

836
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.495
Thanks for finishing up.

837
00:51:47.582 --> 00:51:49.454
Sure thing.

838
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:51.586
Hey. Eve. out there
when I asked about your dad--

839
00:51:51.673 --> 00:51:52.718
It's okay.

840
00:51:59.464 --> 00:52:02.249
- Hey.
- Eh?

841
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:04.817
Yesterday was the best kind
of unexpected.

842
00:52:15.393 --> 00:52:16.394
<i>We're gonna start seeing...</i>

843
00:52:16.481 --> 00:52:18.309
Strong chin.

844
00:52:18.396 --> 00:52:19.179
[TV weatherman <i>as this front
finally closes in.</i>

845
00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:22.617
<i>Some
of these dark green areas--</i>

846
00:52:22.704 --> 00:52:24.315
Looks like another storm.

847
00:52:24.402 --> 00:52:26.230
Doppler radar.

848
00:52:26.317 --> 00:52:27.709
So if you've got big plans

849
00:52:27.796 --> 00:52:29.276
<i>for the day or just...</i>

850
00:52:29.363 --> 00:52:32.323
You look nice.

851
00:52:45.988 --> 00:52:47.729
Vaya con Dios.

852
00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:20.458
Hello?

853
00:53:20.545 --> 00:53:21.894
<i>Three-piece chicken
dinner. pinto beans.</i>

854
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:23.112
<i>and gravy...</i>

855
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.420
If I had to pick a last meal.

856
00:53:26.507 --> 00:53:28.205
and I might...

857
00:53:28.292 --> 00:53:29.554
That'd be the one.

858
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:31.077
Ray. what?
Where the hell are you?

859
00:53:31.164 --> 00:53:32.034
<i>What? You didn't
hear the news?</i>

860
00:53:32.121 --> 00:53:33.993
What news?

861
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.171
Oh man. I had Luis really stick
me about a half a dozen times.

862
00:53:38.258 --> 00:53:39.564
Felt like I stepped
in a yellow jacket nest.

863
00:53:39.651 --> 00:53:41.000
Looked like a horror show.

864
00:53:41.087 --> 00:53:42.828
And by the time
I'm in the ambulance.

865
00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:45.831
I just rise up like Night
of the Living Fucking Dead.

866
00:53:47.485 --> 00:53:49.487
Yeah. but I did
have to put one in Justin.

867
00:53:49.574 --> 00:53:51.140
but that's just so those
fuckers didn't stand there

868
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:52.403
<i>and flag somebody down.</i>

869
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:53.621
<i>Pretty slick. huh?</i>

870
00:53:53.708 --> 00:53:55.144
Jesus. Ray. you...

871
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:56.755
Are you saying you're out?

872
00:53:56.842 --> 00:54:00.498
Buddy. I'm telling you I flew.

873
00:54:00.585 --> 00:54:02.978

Now don't tell me
you told her I sent you

877
00:54:09.507 --> 00:54:11.030

No. no. man. of course not.

No. but you mighta
said what you're up to.

I'm part of this now.

881
00:54:16.165 --> 00:54:18.951
Well. I told you I'd give
anything to see her again.

882
00:54:19.038 --> 00:54:20.648

I gotta check in
with my PO tomorrow.

890
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.274
Straight and narrow. yeah.

891
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:39.667
Yeah. that's it.

892
00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:42.670
Good because it's a long way
down on either side.

00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:16.748
Marina?

897
00:55:26.758 --> 00:55:28.412
How do you know Ray?

898
00:55:28.499 --> 00:55:29.848
St. Brides.

899
00:55:31.153 --> 00:55:33.504
Had to be an ex-con.

900
00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:35.419
The man has no friends left
in the real world.

901
00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:39.771
I think you know
this fucking liar.

902
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:40.946
Marina.

903
00:55:42.469 --> 00:55:44.341
Marina. Marina!

904
00:55:44.428 --> 00:55:46.995
Say that name one more fucking
time and I call the sheriff.

905
00:55:47.082 --> 00:55:49.955
Any outstanding warrants
or parole violations

906
00:55:50.042 --> 00:55:51.260
he'd like to know about?

907
00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:55.047
The photo.

908
00:55:55.134 --> 00:55:57.441
He saw the fucking newspaper.

909
00:55:57.528 --> 00:55:58.442
Yes.

910
00:55:58.529 --> 00:56:00.705
What does he want?

911
00:56:00.792 --> 00:56:01.706
To know your happy.

912
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.797
Look. Ray told me
he was your father.

913
00:56:05.884 --> 00:56:08.495
After this morning.
I don't know what to think.

914
00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:11.150
No. but. Eve...
He escaped somehow.

915
00:56:11.237 --> 00:56:13.631
He's out and driving this way.

916
00:56:17.765 --> 00:56:19.767
You're a fool.

917
00:56:19.854 --> 00:56:22.988
Ray doesn't have a daughter.

918
00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:24.946
He has a vendetta.

919
00:56:25.033 --> 00:56:26.426
Mama.

920
00:56:26.513 --> 00:56:27.819
I finished it.

921
00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:29.603
Great. sweetie.
What did you think?

922
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.475
It is creepier than "Coraline."

923
00:56:31.562 --> 00:56:33.346
Hey. go pour some iced tea
and I'll be in

924
00:56:33.433 --> 00:56:34.782
to hear all about it.

925
00:56:34.869 --> 00:56:35.827
Okay.

926
00:56:38.699 --> 00:56:39.744
Where is he now?

927
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.182
Near the Virginia state
Line... He said.

928
00:56:45.184 --> 00:56:47.055
It'll take him a couple hours
to drive around the inlet.

929
00:56:47.142 --> 00:56:51.190
If Ray's not your father. why is
he so hell-bent on getting here?

930
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:54.715
Your buddy...

931
00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.674
Is coming to kill me.

932
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:02.549
- All right. this way.
- Thank you.

933
00:57:02.636 --> 00:57:04.638
Highway 168
was a parking lot.

934
00:57:04.725 --> 00:57:06.335
Must've been a pile-up
or something.

935
00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:08.294
Well. no traffic
jams out here.

936
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:09.904
You're my last charter.

937
00:57:09.991 --> 00:57:11.253
Yeah.

938
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.081
Yeah. I was headed
home to get some

939
00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:14.996
of the old lady's clam chowder.

940
00:57:15.083 --> 00:57:17.346
Well. I don't want to keep you
from your supper.

941
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:19.000
That's okay.

942
00:57:19.087 --> 00:57:20.567
She's making it
from the can now anywho.

943
00:57:21.655 --> 00:57:22.874
Thinks I can't tell.

944
00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:25.572
Which side of the sound?

945
00:57:25.659 --> 00:57:27.400
You want. uh.
Poplar Branch or Corolla?

946
00:57:29.707 --> 00:57:31.883
The one with the lighthouse.

947
00:57:43.764 --> 00:57:44.983
Does he know about my daughter?

948
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.419
No. I wasn't sure she was yours.

949
00:57:46.506 --> 00:57:49.074
How did he convince
you to do this?

950
00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:50.989
He said he hadn't
done right by you.

951
00:57:51.076 --> 00:57:53.557
But knowing you were happy would
bring some comfort.

952
00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:55.472
He... He's sick.

953
00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:56.647
Sick?

954
00:57:56.734 --> 00:57:58.736
- Like...
- Cancer.

955
00:57:58.823 --> 00:58:00.825
Oh. cancer?

956
00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:02.174
Ray once told a cop
that his mother

957
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:04.132
had hung herself
and he was headed

958
00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:06.918
to go identify the body just to
get out of a speeding ticket.

959
00:58:07.005 --> 00:58:08.310
Tears and all.

960
00:58:08.397 --> 00:58:10.008
I meant what did you owe him?

961
00:58:10.095 --> 00:58:12.140
It wasn't like that.

962
00:58:12.227 --> 00:58:13.838
It's always like that with Ray.

963
00:58:13.925 --> 00:58:15.622
He trades in emotional debt.

964
00:58:15.709 --> 00:58:17.972
Look. I was helping out
a guy who helped me.

965
00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:21.149
Maybe he even saved
my life once or twice.

966
00:58:21.236 --> 00:58:23.064
What debt is he coming
to collect from you?

967
00:58:24.326 --> 00:58:25.937
Time.

968
00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:27.808

Yes.

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:17.499
Very much like "Peter Pan."

993
01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:19.632
On the boat?

994
01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:20.764
That's right.

995
01:01:23.505 --> 01:01:25.464
If I'm not back in a week.
The Whale is yours.

996
01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:28.162
Here.

997
01:01:28.249 --> 01:01:30.469
Eve. what the hell is going on?

998
01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:32.471
Mommy. where's my turtles?

999
01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:35.300
I don't know.
honey. look around.

1000
01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:37.302
- Jess. I gotta go.
- Go? Go where?

1001
01:01:37.389 --> 01:01:38.912
Something happened.
I have to leave.

1002
01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:40.218
I'll call you once we're
settled. okay?

1003
01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:42.133
Oh yeah.

1004
01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.701
I don't understand.
Are you in some kind of trouble?

1005
01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:46.398
Remember that time

1006
01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:49.314
we got drunk on mezcal.
what I told you that night?

1007
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:51.577
Not really.

1008
01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.884
Good.

1009
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.471
Harper. let's go.

1010
01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:22.521
Harper!

1011
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.161
He took her!

1012
01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:05.390
- Took who?
- Harper.

1013
01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:06.565
Okay. we have
to call the police.

1014
01:03:06.652 --> 01:03:08.132
We can't.

1015
01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:09.394
Look. I'm past getting
out of this clean.

1016
01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:11.439
I can't.

1017
01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:14.355
They'll find out who I am.
and then I'll lose her for good.

1018
01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.619
Who you are?

1019
01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:19.273
He won't hurt her.

1020
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.927
I still have something
he wants badly.

1021
01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:26.541
Eve. why can't
we go to the cops?

1022
01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:29.066
Because they want it too.

1023
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:41.818
You hungry?

1024
01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:50.696
You want some?

1025
01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:55.309
Well that's a real nice find.

1026
01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:57.485
It's my turtle.

1027
01:03:57.572 --> 01:03:58.835
I see.

1028
01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:03.013
What's your name. sweetheart?

1029
01:04:04.318 --> 01:04:06.277
Harper.

1030
01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:08.888
Strong name for a strong girl.

1031
01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:10.847
Now you're gonna be brave
for me right now. right?

1032
01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:13.588
Aren't you... Harper?

1033
01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:15.329
Yeah.

1034
01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:17.679
I know you will.
You know how I know?

1035
01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:19.290
It's 'cause I know
your mama. and she's

1036
01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:22.597
about as brave as they come.

1037
01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:24.817
We're good friends. you know...

1038
01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:25.905
Your mama and me.

1039
01:04:29.169 --> 01:04:31.345
What? You don't believe me?

1040
01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:37.699
There. you see her?

1041
01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:39.092
That's my mom?

1042
01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:41.399
Yeah. well she was younger then.

1043
01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:42.966
Real pretty. like you.

1044
01:04:47.448 --> 01:04:49.581
Oh. so how's your
little turtle doing now?

1045
01:04:52.627 --> 01:04:54.629
Better.

1046
01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:56.327
Good.

1047
01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:58.503
Harper...

1048
01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:00.113
How old are you?

1049
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:03.116
Ray didn't come for my daughter.

1050
01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:04.857
He improvised.

1051
01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:06.990
Right now he's figuring out
what he wants us to do.

1052
01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:08.339
He knew you were lying.

1053
01:05:08.426 --> 01:05:10.341
How long were you in with him?

1054
01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:12.343
Three years.

1055
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.998
All that time you thought Ray
was teaching you.

1056
01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.564
he was studying you.

1057
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:19.263
He knows you better
than you know yourself.

1058
01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:23.920
I built a home here.
and the two of you burn it down

1059
01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.747
in a fucking night.

1060
01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:26.748
The two of us?

1061
01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:28.489
I came back to tell you.

1062
01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:30.056
That you showed the Devil
right to my doorstep.

1063
01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:34.931
You said I brought the Devil...

1064
01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:38.543
Well the Devil doesn't come
for the innocent.

1065
01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:01.958
She's okay.

1066
01:06:05.352 --> 01:06:06.701
He wants to meet at a church?

1067
01:06:08.877 --> 01:06:10.967
It's funny to him I guess.

1068
01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.665
All those Sundays
my mom dragged him there.

1069
01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:16.407
If Ray was here
to kill you. he could have.

1070
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.324
What's he really want?

1071
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.110
What he wanted before.

1072
01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:26.156
A different life.

1073
01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:29.159
He was managing a bowling alley
when he met my mom.

1074
01:06:29.246 --> 01:06:32.989
She wasn't doing
so well after my dad died

1075
01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:35.643
and some friends had
gotten her out for the night.

1076
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.995
So a few months after
he starts seeing my mom

1077
01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.127
he comes into my work.

1078
01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:43.564
the gift shop at this state park
where this big Civil War battle

1079
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:45.479
had been fought.

1080
01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:48.917
And he acts all interested.
but he keeps circling back

1081
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.529
to these coins
and weapons on display

1082
01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.661
above the battle diorama.

1083
01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:56.708
- Ray saw an opportunity--
- He lifted the loot.

1084
01:06:58.623 --> 01:06:59.798
We did.

1085
01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:07.893
But then you
gave him up and ran.

1086
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.895
The things you'll do
for your kids.

1087
01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.770
How much is left?

1088
01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:19.035
His half...

1089
01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.862
At least.

1090
01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.563
Give him what he wants.

1091
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.218
I'll make the trade in church.

1092
01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:31.917
Ray and I. we've got
a come-to-Jesus coming anyway.

1093
01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:43.581
I'm sorry. I didn't know
he was gonna turn jackrabbit.

1094
01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:44.582
Pops. I swear.

1095
01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:47.541
No. you just gave him reason to.

1096
01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:56.594
Just get your
skinny ass back here and...

1097
01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.770
We won't talk about it again.

1098
01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:00.554
<i>I'm going to.</i>

1099
01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:03.731
I just wanted
to say you were right.

1100
01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:06.386
Well...

1101
01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:09.694
"right" changes over time.

1102
01:08:14.699 --> 01:08:15.700
I'll see you soon.

1103
01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:23.316
- Good to see you.

1104
01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:44.946
♪ God in Three Persons
Blessed Trinity ♪

1105
01:08:45.033 --> 01:08:45.947
Amen.

1106
01:08:46.034 --> 01:08:47.427
Be seated with the Lord.

1107
01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:56.784
We welcome all believers
into His house

1108
01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:58.786
this morning
as we also welcome Him

1109
01:08:58.873 --> 01:09:00.136
into our hearts and our lives.

1110
01:09:03.704 --> 01:09:06.403
You know I love the
sermon of the prodigal son.

1111
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:07.839
Spoke with someone
earlier today.

1112
01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:09.493
that's their testimony
and I love that.

1113
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.016
Thank you for sharing that.

1114
01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:13.279
God talked to me about
something. uh.

1115
01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:15.368
on the drive here and...

1116
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:16.804
It's about the story
of Jonah and I--

1117
01:09:16.891 --> 01:09:18.719
Well... Praise be.

1118
01:09:18.806 --> 01:09:19.981
--kinda wanna call an
audible and talk about Jonah

1119
01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:21.896
- for a second.
- Where is she?

1120
01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:23.115
Yeah.
Jonah and the whale.

1121
01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:24.856
Safe and sound.

1122
01:09:24.943 --> 01:09:26.684
And it wasn't
a whale. It was a big fish.

1123
01:09:26.771 --> 01:09:29.339
You on the other hand
look a little rough.

1124
01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:32.124
There's some things that
have been keeping me up.

1125
01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:35.736
Free will's a bitch. ain't it?

1126
01:09:35.823 --> 01:09:40.306
We're just as liable to make
the bad calls as the good.

1127
01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:42.134
I think you should be
up there preaching.

1128
01:09:42.221 --> 01:09:43.875
What God placed
on my heart was not just--

1129
01:09:43.962 --> 01:09:46.399
What. to these people?
True believers?

1130
01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.314
They don't want to hear that...

1131
01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:50.925
Everything's
they're own damn fault.

1132
01:09:51.012 --> 01:09:53.667
You know. that's what
you made of me. Ray...

1133
01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:56.540
A true believer and a fool.

1134
01:09:56.627 --> 01:09:58.542
What you're doing here
waiting around for her.

1135
01:09:58.629 --> 01:09:59.978
that was pretty damn foolish.

1136
01:10:00.065 --> 01:10:01.501
I'm here because you lied to me.

1137
01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:02.720
Lies of omission.

1138
01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:04.374
Cancer?

1139
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:08.334
You needed a little nudge.

1140
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:09.901
Marina...

1141
01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:11.816
Your daughter. Ray?

1142
01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.470
I was more a father to that girl
than her own daddy ever was.

1143
01:10:13.557 --> 01:10:14.862
you hear me?

1144
01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.734
And that cheap shit
pearl bracelet's

1145
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:17.996
the only thing
she ever got from that man.

1146
01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:19.476
Yeah. and you gave her what?

1147
01:10:19.563 --> 01:10:21.042
A warrant around her neck?

1148
01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:24.568
She earned that one herself.

1149
01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:27.353
Didn't go where he
was supposed to go.

1150
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.442
I was thinking about
some events in my own life--

1151
01:10:29.529 --> 01:10:32.097
There's a boat down
in the harbor. The Driftwood.

1152
01:10:32.184 --> 01:10:34.273
Bring Harper. I'll bring what
you're here for and you can

1153
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.971
take it and your chances south.

1154
01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:38.712
We think
that if you sin.

1155
01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:40.410
it only affects you but
there's a ripple effect of sin.

1156
01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.936
It affects
so many other people.

1157
01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:47.678
Think about the people
in your tribe.

1158
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.072
Hee hee hee. yeah.

1159
01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:52.465
Oh. all right.

1160
01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:54.032
I...I'm sorry. pastor.

1161
01:10:54.119 --> 01:10:56.252
Just a little
extra joyful this morning.

1162
01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:59.429
Well. uh. um...

1163
01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:02.083
That is all right because.
uh. we are called

1164
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:05.478
to make a joyful
noise for the Lord.

1165
01:11:05.565 --> 01:11:09.047
We should pick up our hymn books
and let's turn to the next hymn

1166
01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:10.440
in the bulletin.

1167
01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:12.268
"I am Coming to the Cross."

1168
01:11:12.355 --> 01:11:15.096
Now let's all stand and...
And sing that now.

1169
01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:30.198
♪ I am coming to the cross
I am poor and weak and blind ♪

1170
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.288
Who's the bigger liar now. son?

1171
01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:35.203
♪ I am counting all but dross ♪

1172
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.597
You tell her to bring the spoils
and she'll get her daughter.

1173
01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:42.385
♪ I shall full salvation find ♪

1174
01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:48.173
♪ Long my heart
Has sighed for Thee ♪

1175
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:53.352
♪ Long has evil reigned within ♪

1176
01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:59.271
♪ Jesus sweetly speaks to me ♪

1177
01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:03.710
♪ I will cleanse
you all from sin ♪

1178
01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:04.929
Dovey?

1179
01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:06.496
Hold on there. boy.

1180
01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.502
Stay still. Stay still.

1181
01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:15.505
Get up here.

1182
01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:18.725
You wanna atone?

1183
01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:20.379
We got churches
in Virginia too. hon.

1184
01:12:23.904 --> 01:12:26.429
Let's go.

1185
01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:33.958
She was supposed to meet
me there and she didn't show.

1186
01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:35.351
At the church?

1187
01:12:37.483 --> 01:12:39.659
- You in love with this girl?
- No. ma'am.

1188
01:12:39.746 --> 01:12:41.182
I just made a promise.

1189
01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:46.318
A promise... To which fugitive?

1190
01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:59.070
I went to see
your mom up in D.C.

1191
01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:01.768
She didn't know
you'd gotten out.

1192
01:13:01.855 --> 01:13:04.380
Well. her career ambitions
and my felony conviction

1193
01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:06.338
never really mixed.

1194
01:13:06.425 --> 01:13:08.122
Hm.

1195
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:10.821
She told me about your summer
fling whose father owns

1196
01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:12.823
half the Virginia coastline.

1197
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:16.653
About you two coming home
from a party. pretty fucked up.

1198
01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.832
How she pulls a U and bottoms
her Camaro out on a divider.

1199
01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:26.489
And it just sticks there.
not one tire touching.

1200
01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:28.882
I can just see those
sweet tears coming down.

1201
01:13:32.233 --> 01:13:35.846
So before the cops pull up...

1202
01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:37.891
You switch seats.

1203
01:13:37.978 --> 01:13:40.198
You decide to get behind
the wheel. not thinking

1204
01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:43.941
about her influential daddy
or the pills in the glove box.

1205
01:13:44.028 --> 01:13:48.859
Three years for something you
Thought was right... Then.

1206
01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:51.862
Yeah. but "right"
changes over time.

1207
01:13:51.949 --> 01:13:53.646
Hm.

1208
01:13:53.733 --> 01:13:57.258
They have recordings of all your
conversations with Ray.

1209
01:13:57.345 --> 01:13:59.826
Right now they don't suspect
you of anything more

1210
01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:02.438
than putting your faith
in a known con man.

1211
01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:04.744
They're gonna work
it all out soon enough.

1212
01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:06.267
Help them get there quicker.

1213
01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:23.328
All right.
watch your step now.

1214
01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:27.332
- Harper.
- Mommy.

1215
01:14:27.419 --> 01:14:30.204
Oh... Oh baby. I'm here.

1216
01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:32.424
Are you okay?

1217
01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:34.295
Yeah. of course she's okay.

1218
01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:35.819
She was with me.

1219
01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:37.734
Honey... [Ray] Hi. Ray.

1220
01:14:37.821 --> 01:14:39.605
Seven years looks good on you.

1221
01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:41.215
You held up
pretty well considering.

1222
01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:46.438
Honey. this man
and I have to talk.

1223
01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:48.919
His name is Ray.

1224
01:14:49.006 --> 01:14:50.747
I know.

1225
01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:53.097
Ray and I. we need to talk
about some grown-up stuff.

1226
01:14:53.184 --> 01:14:54.490
Uh-oh.

1227
01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:55.534
I'm in trouble.

1228
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.539
Can you stay here for just five
minutes while we step outside?

1229
01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:01.932
I'll be right on deck.

1230
01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:10.506
Okay. It's okay.

1231
01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:22.518
You renamed our boat.

1232
01:15:24.868 --> 01:15:25.869
That's bad luck. you know.

1233
01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:29.742
Driftwood?

1234
01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:33.441
Well. you didn't
drift very far. did you?

1235
01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:34.399
I reckon that's
'cause of your mom.

1236
01:15:34.486 --> 01:15:35.966
Yeah. hey. how is she?

1237
01:15:36.053 --> 01:15:38.403
I ain't got time
to reminisce with you. Ray.

1238
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:40.492
They find you. they find me.

1239
01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:43.190
And what I bought with my half
of the money wasn't for me.

1240
01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:44.975
It was for her.

1241
01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:47.760
Now none of that
matters without her.

1242
01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:52.025
So thank you for bringing
Her back... But where

1243
01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:56.726
- you've put us now--
- Where I put <i>you?</i>

1244
01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.208
Last night. you not knowing
about your daughter.

1245
01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:03.733
what you'd find
when you woke up...

1246
01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:07.214
Yeah. I'm guessing
you didn't catch a wink.

1247
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:10.827
Well how much sleep you think
I got where you put me?

1248
01:16:10.914 --> 01:16:13.481
Mom? Mommy? Where are you?

1249
01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:17.311
Go... Ho--honey. go back inside.
We're almost done. Go.

1250
01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:24.405
You always were much tougher
than your own mama.

1251
01:16:24.492 --> 01:16:26.669
Your girl's got that too.

1252
01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:27.757
Your grit.

1253
01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:38.637
You know they say
insomnia cuts more years

1254
01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:41.379
off your life than smoking.

1255
01:16:41.466 --> 01:16:43.511
They've studied it.

1256
01:16:47.777 --> 01:16:52.782
So prison. it seems.
takes it from both ends.

1257
01:16:52.869 --> 01:16:54.784
Yeah...

1258
01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:57.787
The now... And the later.

1259
01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:05.359
Oh. but...

1260
01:17:05.446 --> 01:17:08.014
Being awake 20 hours
a day does give you time

1261
01:17:08.101 --> 01:17:12.323
to think of what you'd do
with the in-between...

1262
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:14.151
If you had the means.

1263
01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:20.897
There's plenty left...

1264
01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:21.985
But we have to go get it.

1265
01:17:33.344 --> 01:17:34.954
Get your story straight.

1266
01:18:00.023 --> 01:18:02.242
Hmm.

1267
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.263
Give me that now.

1268
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:24.787
Go on. Topside.

1269
01:18:24.874 --> 01:18:26.571
Follow Mommy.

1270
01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:36.494
Poor woman up in Carova.
she's been worried sick

1271
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.278
about her husband all morning.

1272
01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:40.019
Never brought his boat
back in last night.

1273
01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:41.717
Know why?

1274
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:51.291
Time to fill in the blanks...

1275
01:18:51.378 --> 01:18:53.554
For the sake
of the next someone.

1276
01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:01.737
"God is real and he's
not laughing with you."

1277
01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:04.827
That was written in the first
cell I ever slept in.

1278
01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:06.306
You did good. Dovey.

1279
01:19:06.393 --> 01:19:07.655
They'll get him.

1280
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.962
He's on an island now.

1281
01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:12.530
He was on an island
in prison too.

1282
01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:18.971
Hey. who told you
I'd be at the church?

1283
01:19:19.058 --> 01:19:21.887
Didn't leave a name.

1284
01:19:21.974 --> 01:19:26.674
You're here by Ray's
invitation. just like me.

1285
01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:27.763
They won't catch him.

1286
01:19:30.461 --> 01:19:31.679
I gotta pee.

1287
01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:37.860
To the last drop
'cause we ain't stopping again.

1288
01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:28.040
Goddammit. it's
stuck on something.

1289
01:20:28.127 --> 01:20:29.172
Ah.

1290
01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:44.752
Hey. hey. hey. hold it.

1291
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.277
I said plant your ass. boy.

1292
01:20:47.364 --> 01:20:51.237
Thank you. PO. for caring
enough to come all this way.

1293
01:20:51.324 --> 01:20:53.196
Now listen to me. I don't know
what you're thinking

1294
01:20:53.283 --> 01:20:55.154
but you could be adding
months. maybe even years.

1295
01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:56.721
Hell. if I'm gonna
pay a price again.

1296
01:20:56.808 --> 01:20:58.854
it'll be for something
of my own making.

1297
01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:00.768
For the sake of the next
someone. right?

1298
01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.335
Dovey. don't.

1299
01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:05.469
They made their bed.
let 'em goddamn lie.

1300
01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:08.689
Dovey. let 'em lie!
Let 'em goddamn lie!

1301
01:21:08.776 --> 01:21:11.388
You couldn't have just shoved
it under the floorboards?

1302
01:21:11.475 --> 01:21:15.566
All right. let's use
the motor to haul this thing up.

1303
01:21:15.653 --> 01:21:16.784
Okay?

1304
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:17.916
Real gradual.

1305
01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:23.095
Right there. yeah.

1306
01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:34.367
All right. a little more.

1307
01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:46.162
Oh. shit. cut it off.
Cut the engine.

1308
01:21:46.249 --> 01:21:47.641
Now. Do it now.

1309
01:21:57.825 --> 01:21:59.044
Harper. baby. stay right there.

1310
01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:01.090
Hold on to that rail.

1311
01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:07.226
Ah!

1312
01:22:07.313 --> 01:22:08.793
Harper!

1313
01:22:10.447 --> 01:22:11.665
Harper. be still.

1314
01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:13.406
Don't struggle. baby. It's okay.

1315
01:22:13.493 --> 01:22:14.581
- You stay right where you are.

1316
01:22:14.668 --> 01:22:17.149
She's ours.

1317
01:22:17.236 --> 01:22:19.673
I swear to god. Ray. she is.

1318
01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.546
Ah.

1319
01:22:22.633 --> 01:22:23.851
I know.

1320
01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:27.333
That math ain't hard.

1321
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.465
The rope.

1322
01:22:28.552 --> 01:22:29.857
Some divers put it there.

1323
01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.207
I...I don't know
what's at the other end

1324
01:22:31.294 --> 01:22:32.512
but it's not
a dry-bag full of money.

1325
01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:33.774
That's the truth.

1326
01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:35.341
- Where then?
- In the cabin.

1327
01:22:35.428 --> 01:22:36.473
There--there's a space
under one of the drains.

1328
01:22:39.606 --> 01:22:41.608
All right. I believe you.

1329
01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:43.697
- Come on.
- Ray. wait. Wait!

1330
01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:46.004
Wait? Seven fucking
years I waited. Come on.

1331
01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.527
Go. baby. Come on. go.

1332
01:22:47.614 --> 01:22:50.008
Come on.

1333
01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:51.270
Oh. not you.

1334
01:22:51.357 --> 01:22:52.706
Hell no. Front of the boat.

1335
01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.775
You took more from me
than I even knew.

1336
01:23:17.862 --> 01:23:19.995
- Now get in the water.
- Ray. it's--

1337
01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:22.519
Go on. you're a good swimmer.
you'll make it to shore.

1338
01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:25.261
And you'll spend tomorrow...
And the next day

1339
01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:27.828
and the next day
wondering where she is.

1340
01:23:27.915 --> 01:23:31.615
It's your turn
to wake up afraid.

1341
01:23:31.702 --> 01:23:33.312
Ray. we can still do this.

1342
01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:35.749
- No.
- Together.

1343
01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:38.970
I--I--I was a scared kid.
Ray. and you were

1344
01:23:39.057 --> 01:23:41.103
the last person
I should've been afraid of.

1345
01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.714
I didn't know
they would catch you.

1346
01:23:43.801 --> 01:23:45.803
Didn't think they could.

1347
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:50.373
You taught me to see
into the future.

1348
01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.157
Everything we need
is right here on this boat.

1349
01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:54.029
Everything to start over.

1350
01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:56.292
Seven years is nothing compared
to the time we still have.

1351
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.556
Look at me.

1352
01:24:02.863 --> 01:24:05.127
It's Marina.

1353
01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:06.389
Yeah...

1354
01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:42.381
I love the way you lie.

1355
01:24:55.046 --> 01:24:58.571
Get outta here! Go! Run!

1356
01:25:14.761 --> 01:25:15.545
Harper. come on.
Come on. come on.

1357
01:25:16.807 --> 01:25:18.025
Go down there.

1358
01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.853
Harper. stay down.

1359
01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:21.072
Don't come out no matter
what you hear.

1360
01:25:34.346 --> 01:25:36.000
Goddammit.

1361
01:25:36.087 --> 01:25:38.742
You haven't learned
a damn thing. did you?

1362
01:25:38.829 --> 01:25:41.353
You couldn't just let things be
what they were going to be?

1363
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.181
None of this had to be. Ray.

1364
01:25:43.268 --> 01:25:44.878
You're damn right.

1365
01:25:44.965 --> 01:25:47.794
You could've just played
your part and taken a bow.

1366
01:25:47.881 --> 01:25:50.754
Now my daughter
has to watch a man die.

1367
01:25:53.626 --> 01:25:57.717
You know what that
does to a kid?

1368
01:25:57.804 --> 01:26:00.285
I do.

1369
01:26:00.372 --> 01:26:05.290
You oughtta maybe
make that wish now.

1370
01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:08.772
We both know who wishes are for.

1371
01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:10.904
I sure hope she was worth it.

1372
01:26:10.991 --> 01:26:12.079
Ah!

1373
01:26:21.654 --> 01:26:22.786
Ray...
- Huh?

1374
01:26:22.873 --> 01:26:23.961
I...

1375
01:27:30.506 --> 01:27:31.550
Dovey?

1376
01:27:35.337 --> 01:27:38.209
Where is he?

1377
01:27:38.296 --> 01:27:40.690
He couldn't be saved.

1378
01:27:44.171 --> 01:27:45.347
Take the line.

1379
01:27:52.876 --> 01:27:54.834
You've got cover.

1380
01:27:54.921 --> 01:27:56.183
You've got the fog.

1381
01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.968
Dovey. just grab
the fucking line.

1382
01:27:58.055 --> 01:27:59.709
You said it.

1383
01:27:59.796 --> 01:28:02.320
Everything you need
to start over is with you.

1384
01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:10.110
The story I tell them
will buy you time.

1385
01:28:10.197 --> 01:28:12.461
Eve. raise your sail.

1386
01:28:25.343 --> 01:28:26.997
Find me again.

1387
01:29:02.685 --> 01:29:04.730
Straight ahead.

1388
01:29:19.615 --> 01:29:21.704
You know they found
her boat on the rocks

1389
01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:24.489
off Cumberland Island. Georgia.

1390
01:29:24.576 --> 01:29:26.665
I might've read
something about that.

1391
01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.411
Didn't find her
or the girl though.

1392
01:29:33.498 --> 01:29:35.413
Tragic.

1393
01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.849
They went ahead
and closed the case.

1394
01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:43.247
Of course...

1395
01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:45.815
The water is real warm
down there.

1396
01:29:45.902 --> 01:29:48.818
Yes. ma'am.

1397
01:30:06.313 --> 01:30:08.533
