4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.359
and was undoubtedly

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.733
one of the most horrific
periods of history.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.339
To begin to understand Hitler.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.259
you've really gotta understand

8
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.593
that he was the most amazing demagogue.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.679
The Nazi Party

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.469
and its immoral leader instilled one

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.029
of the most corrupt regimes

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.332
on the people of Germany
and its invisible enemies.

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.893
However. Adolf Hitler
was not working alone.

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.279
It's the SS men doing the.

15
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.139
not only the exterminations.

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.429
and are notorious for being

17
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.339
some of the most evil and deadly troops.

18
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.599
He had a circle of

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.120
some of the most barbaric
and evil men alongside him

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.763
who helped make the atrocities possible.

21
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.529
If there were
unpleasant things going on.

22
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.239
or policies that they didn't like.

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.399
then somehow that Hitler
couldn't know about it.

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.929
that he wasn't associated with it.

25
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.979
it can't have been him.

26
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.279
If only the Fuhrer knew.
this wouldn't be happening.

27
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.700
These are the Nazi fugitives.

28
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.409
Adolf Hitler was a German politician

29
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.749
and leader of the Nazi party.

30
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.039
He rose to power as the
Chancellor of Germany in 1933.

31
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.743
and then as Fuhrer in 1934.

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.259
During his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945.

33
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.259
he initiated World War II in Europe

34
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.119
by invading Poland on the
1st of September. 1939.

35
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.120
- Extremist politics thrives
on chaos. on poverty.

36
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.679
destitution. and want.

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.619
And what you see as a result
of the Wall Street crash

38
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.803
and the slump. the late '20s. early '30s.

39
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.419
are all those things in
this hideous cocktail

40
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.059
that an extremist like Hitler.

41
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.321
he's saying. I can solve this.

42
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.269
- Some of the important ways

43
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.719
in which he helped the party to develop

44
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.059
was through the initiation of a newspaper.

45
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.706
so a party newspaper called
the "Volkischer Beobatcher."

46
00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.469
"The People's Observer."

47
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.969
- And also what Hitler
is absolutely amazing at

48
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.529
is speech making.

49
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.809
And to begin to understand Hitler.

50
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.729
you've really gotta understand

51
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.003
that he was the most amazing demagogue.

52
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.079
He got on that stage this little man.

53
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.599
and he would sort of grow in stature.

54
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.419
He would sort of absolutely
sort of. you know.

55
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.231
take over the entire beer
hall with his presence.

56
00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:17.879
- And he would shout and he'd get quiet.

57
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.603
and he would almost enter
into a kind of trance.

58
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.349
And the audiences would
be mesmerized by this.

59
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.779
And indeed they'd be
mesmerized by it for decades.

60
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.029
And this is key to how
Hitler gets into power.

61
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.919
because when he's on the stage.

62
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.095
he becomes another figure.

63
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.379
- On the 30th of January. 1933.

64
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.739
Hitler was appointed
Chancellor of Germany.

65
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.209
but of a coalition government.

66
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.269
So there were just three Nazi posts

67
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.979
in that coalition government.

68
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.707
- It's very tempting to
think that when Hitler.

69
00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:54.629
you know. comes to power in early 1933.

70
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.899
that his grip on power
is absolutely total.

71
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.169
In fact. you know. he has
a very uneven. shaky start.

72
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.509
He's still quite worried
about public opinion.

73
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.619
So what he does is a mixture
of passing various laws

74
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.879
that give him more and more power.

75
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.849
like the Enabling Act
that actually makes him.

76
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.376
you know. immensely powerful.

77
00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:16.529
But also he takes advantage
of various events.

78
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.899
like the Reichstag fire.

79
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.719
in which the German parliament
building burns down.

80
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.389
Now. it's highly likely but never proven

81
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.089
whether the Nazis actually
burnt it down themselves.

82
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.369
but certainly in a
sense. it doesn't matter.

83
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.219
What happens is. is that
Hitler and the Nazis

84
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.639
took advantage of the
Reichstag burning down

85
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.466
to show that there was
a Communist plot against

86
00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:40.649
what the Nazis described

87
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.419
as still being a democratic government.

88
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.376
And it enabled them to seize more power.

89
00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:46.829
you know. by emergency decree.

90
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.889
- Very quickly. he turned
Germany into a one-party state.

91
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.829
So first of all. he made sure to eliminate

92
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.279
the influence and power of
the German political left.

93
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.979
So the Socialist Party
and the Communist Party.

94
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.019
for a start. were banned.

95
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.539
But over a short amount of time as well.

96
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.449
the Nazi Party was the
only legal party too.

97
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.659
- Eventually. in January
'33. he becomes chancellor.

98
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.849
Now. don't forget. chancellor in Germany.

99
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.409
and this still remains today.

100
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.929
is not. at the time. the head of state.

101
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.399
The head of state is the president.

102
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.809
So. it's the chancellor. though.

103
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.763
who has the real executive power.

104
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.859
In order to take as much power as he can.

105
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.189
he's also gonna have to
make himself head of state.

106
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.009
And that really becomes
an opportunity for him

107
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.659
when Hindenburg dies

108
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.489
and he's able to take on the role

109
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.499
of both president and chancellor

110
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.859
and kind of create this
new role for himself.

111
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.019
And that is the role of Fuhrer.

112
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.119
the German word for leader.

113
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.939
That is a fascist term. be there no doubt.

114
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.639
This is a kind of new form of governance

115
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.259
that Germany now has.

116
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.149
Other parties are banned.

117
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.269
the only party allowed is the Nazi Party.

118
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.719
This has become a totalitarian state.

119
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.599
and Hitler can say to the German people.

120
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.159
you voted for it.

121
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.871
It's a con. and it's a con that worked.

122
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.849
With pagan pageantry.

123
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.249
the district leaders from all over Germany

124
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.589
swore personal allegiance to him.

125
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.942
hypnotized with the belief

126
00:06:32.943 --> 00:06:35.673
that they were members of a master race.

127
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.839
This film will deal with
act one of the Nazi bid

128
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.009
for world power.

129
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.253
the most fantastic play
in all recorded history.

130
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.519
- Hitler starts to build
up his power by. you know.

131
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.129
trying to employ and find the right people

132
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.489
who are gonna listen to the
beat of his drum and follow it.

133
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.989
And so there's a lot of
very patient politicking

134
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.169
and a lot of persuasion.
a lot of speech making.

135
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.749
you know. it's a very. very
difficult rise to power.

136
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.049
But Hitler knows that it can't
take place through force.

137
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.024
it has to take place from the
ballot box and not the bullet.

138
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.739
Paul Joseph Goebbels

139
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.049
was a German Nazi politician

140
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.119
and Reich Minister of Propaganda

141
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.783
of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.

142
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.749
He was one of Adolf Hitler's closest

143
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.733
and most devoted associates.

144
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.569
He was known for his
skills in public speaking

145
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.959
and his deeply virulent antisemitism.

146
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.963
which was evident in his
publicly-voiced views.

147
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.159
In May. 1933. Goebbels arranged

148
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.309
the burning of all un-German books

149
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.469
at the Opera House in Berlin.

150
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.973
indicating that the Nazis were
taking control of everything.

151
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.699
He gained control of the media entirely.

152
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.189
controlling all aspects of the press.

153
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.729
radio. theaters. films. and television.

154
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.583
literature. music. and the fine arts.

155
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.209
Joseph Goebbels and his wife. Magda.

156
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.299
are seen as the perfect German family

157
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.679
to set an example for the German people.

158
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.379
- Joseph Goebbels joined the
Nazi Party quite early on.

159
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.669
as did Hitler.

160
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:46.349
And he became very much
involved in those early years

161
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.939
with helping the party to develop.

162
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.089
and in particular. with these
techniques of propaganda.

163
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.009
and really getting these messages across

164
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.659
to the German nation.

165
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.509
Part of the way that
he and Hitler did this

166
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.369
was to use very short slogans.

167
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.019
but to keep repeating them

168
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.923
so that everybody knew what
the Nazi Party was about.

169
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.950
- He is married

170
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:11.579
to a very sort of striking
woman called Magda.

171
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.109
Now. Magda has been married before

172
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.329
to a very wealthy German industrialist.

173
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.649
but she eventually gets divorced

174
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.239
and marries Joseph Goebbels.

175
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.549
who was a real Casanova actually.

176
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.529
even though he was short. club footed.

177
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.655
and not an attractive man.

178
00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:26.812
you know. he had a lot
of sexual conquests.

179
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.629
What you see in the marriage

180
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.630
of Joseph Goebbels and Magda
is a three way. not in bed.

181
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.380
but emotionally between
those two and Adolf Hitler.

182
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.829
because Adolf Hitler absolutely
adored Magda Goebbels

183
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.429
and thought that she was the
kind of perfect Nazi woman.

184
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.779
You know. and she was blonde

185
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.419
and she was. you know. sort of vivacious

186
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.269
and she was absolutely devoted to Hitler.

187
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.645
She absolutely adored him.

188
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.219
- Magda was very good for the Nazi Party.

189
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.669
And when Goebbels
introduced her to Hitler.

190
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.769
Hitler got on very well with her

191
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.209
and sort of could see the advantages

192
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.819
and encouraged them to get married.

193
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.319
Part of the reason for that was

194
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.789
that she was very well bred
and very refined and elegant.

195
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.109
She was the mother of the Reich.

196
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.179
because she had six children.

197
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.859
- Hitler liked the Goebbels's marriage

198
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.299
as a kind of domestic situation

199
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.726
he could drop in and out of.

200
00:10:25.727 --> 00:10:29.339
He liked the security that
involved children running around.

201
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.009
boats on lakes. you know. it felt normal.

202
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.979
And also. Hitler did not
want to have any rumors

203
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.469
about his relationship
with Magda Goebbels.

204
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.179
because there were rumors

205
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.789
that he had fathered some
of the Goebbels' children.

206
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.009
and that had seen even
a very senior Nazi sent

207
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.865
to a concentration camp for
actually mentioning that.

208
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.879
- Hitler and Joseph Goebbels

209
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.549
had sort of grown through
the ranks of the Nazi Party.

210
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.689
and sort of succeeded.

211
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.419
sort of made their rise
to success together.

212
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.609
When Hitler came to power.

213
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.979
Goebbels was somehow overlooked
for a cabinet position.

214
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.970
We said there were just three.

215
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:04.829
he didn't get any of them.

216
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.899
Nevertheless. after the Nazis took power.

217
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.669
that seizure of power.

218
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.759
he orchestrated a very
big torchlight parade.

219
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.585
a kind of victory parade
for the new movement.

220
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.119
He knew how to get the
message across to the Germans.

221
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.879
So once he was the Minister of Propaganda.

222
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.429
first of all. there was
censorship of the press.

223
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.709
but also not just controlling the press.

224
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.319
but he controlled all
aspects of cultural life.

225
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.909
So that was art. architecture.
literature. music.

226
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.209
Propaganda machine was
very. very important

227
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.149
to the whole story that the
Third Reich was telling.

228
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.859
and indeed. right up until the end.

229
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.999
And indeed even important.

230
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.249
once the tide of the war
turned against Germany.

231
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.699
There was still this need
to maintain the storyline.

232
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.903
to maintain what the
Third Reich represented.

233
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.419
- So. you know. you have
essentially Goebbels

234
00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.969
heart of the Third Reich.
propaganda minister.

235
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.409
getting word out there.

236
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.479
Magda Goebbels. his wife.

237
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.112
who is more devoted to Hitler than to him.

238
00:12:07.113 --> 00:12:08.699
And then you've got Goebbels

239
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.049
who's probably more devoted to Hitler

240
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.399
than he is to his own wife.

241
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.369
And if you want to see
the ultimate expression

242
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.370
of this twisted. bizarre. dark.
horrific love. if you like.

243
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.919
it's the fact that they
both kill themselves

244
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.899
to follow Hitler into the afterlife.

245
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.859
And they kill their own
children in the bunker.

246
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.539
poison all six children.

247
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.889
because a world without Hitler

248
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.549
and a world without Nazism
is no place for their kids.

249
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.691
That's how much they adored Hitler.

250
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.849
Heinrich
Himmler was Reichsfuhrer

251
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.349
of the Schutzstaffel

252
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.053
and a leading member of
the Nazi Party of Germany.

253
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.949
Himmler was considered one
of the most powerful men

254
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.149
in Nazi Germany.

255
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.583
and a leading architect of the Holocaust.

256
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.969
Heinrich Himmler established his force

257
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.183
of elite bodyguards for Hitler. the SS.

258
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.070
Himmler established

259
00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:13.919
the first Nazi concentration
camp in Dachau.

260
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.729
indicating he had no issue
bringing harm to Jews

261
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.073
as he considered them
vermin within Germany.

262
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.089
- Himmler. like Hitler.
looked like the very inverse

263
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.949
of the kind of Aryan.
blonde. 6'5" tall superhuman.

264
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.689
You know. he was a very short man.

265
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.179
He has weak jawline. very ugly.

266
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.099
You know. he has pebble glasses.

267
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.689
former chicken farmer.

268
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.439
You know. he looked
very. very unimpressive.

269
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.649
- Himmler had joined the Nazi
Party in quite early years.

270
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.469
And I think that the important
thing about what Himmler did

271
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.106
was that he established the SS.

272
00:13:49.107 --> 00:13:52.259
And the SS started out
as a very small group.

273
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.919
and. in fact. started out as
Hitler's personal bodyguard.

274
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.579
Himmler extended his power very
quickly and his power base.

275
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.579
So with the SS. a very small organization

276
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.069
that had started out as Hitler's bodyguard

277
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.169
suddenly became thousands strong.

278
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.529
By about 1936. he was in charge

279
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.269
of a very vast complex
of the SS. the Gestapo.

280
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.807
which was the secret police.
and the security police.

281
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.859
And what Himmler does from.

282
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.809
you know. almost from the beginning.

283
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.810
is to build the SS up into
a state within a state.

284
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.179
Because by the height of Nazi power.

285
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.969
Himmler is in charge of an organization

286
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.659
that has a kind of civil side to it.

287
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.069
an administrative side to it.

288
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.339
which is huge and has
fingers in so many pies.

289
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.609
And also the Waffen SS. the armed SS.

290
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.309
which is there. you know.
to help fight the war.

291
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.166
And its troops are notorious

292
00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:53.459
for being some of the most sort of.

293
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.369
kind of evil and deadly troops. you know.

294
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.229
as part of the war.

295
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.059
He became in charge

296
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.839
of the whole concentration camp system.

297
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.239
- He was responsible for the Holocaust

298
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.019
because. you know. it was the
SS largely who carried it out.

299
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.949
And when he went to go and
kind of witness a slaughter.

300
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.639
you know. some brains were
splattered upon his coat

301
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.885
and it caused him to vomit.

302
00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:22.799
You know. this is the
man responsible for it.

303
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.209
and he can't cope with it.

304
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.619
I'm not saying it's desirable

305
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.819
that he should have coped with it.

306
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.750
but it just shows you

307
00:15:27.751 --> 00:15:30.869
that he didn't actually
have the personal appetite

308
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.639
for butchering people himself

309
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.199
and got other people to do it.

310
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.186
In many ways. he was a coward.

311
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.259
Hermann Wilhelm
Goring was a German politician.

312
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.510
a military leader. and later
a convicted war criminal

313
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.689
Goring was one of the
most influential figures

314
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.073
in the Nazi party.

315
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.749
He was also framed in a scandal.

316
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.159
claiming he was attempting

317
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.553
to take over the Fuhrer's
powers in the war's final days.

318
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.169
Goring wrote a letter to Hitler.

319
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.569
offering to relieve Hitler of his duties

320
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.719
and act in his place as
he had believed the Fuhrer

321
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.333
was encircled and helpless in Berlin.

322
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.009
This was a reasonable act

323
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.153
as Hitler had named
him the political heir.

324
00:16:32.423 --> 00:16:34.799
Hitler issued a telegram to Goring

325
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.259
and told him he had committed high treason

326
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.169
and gave him the option
to resign his office

327
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.333
in exchange for his life.

328
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.439
- Hermann Goring is a
really key Nazi figure.

329
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.819
He's a big figure in every way.

330
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.489
because he also became enormously fat.

331
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.879
But you've gotta think of
Goring and his kind of arc.

332
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.713
if you like.

333
00:16:57.714 --> 00:17:01.019
So he goes from being a First
World War fighter pilot hero

334
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.299
who's got the Pour le Merite medal.

335
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.939
which is the highest medal that can be won

336
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.849
by the German fighting man
in the First World War.

337
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.683
You know. for the British.

338
00:17:09.684 --> 00:17:11.279
it's like winning the Victoria Cross.

339
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.539
or for the Americans.

340
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.369
it's like winning the
kind of Medal of Honor.

341
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.829
It's a hugely important award.

342
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.289
And so he's a venerated pilot.

343
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.892
very successful fighter pilot
during the First World War.

344
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.629
And then when he falls in with the Nazis

345
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.039
in Munich in the 20s.

346
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.899
he's feeling that that's giving him

347
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.321
a kind of sense of purpose.

348
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.609
- Goring was quite an
interesting character

349
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.059
because he had several different
roles in the Third Reich.

350
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.259
And even before then.

351
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.299
if we think about his
First World War record

352
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.919
as this sort of flying ace.

353
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.499
it meant that later on
Hitler made him head

354
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.810
of the Luftwaffe. the German Air Force.

355
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.733
- The problem is.

356
00:18:04.734 --> 00:18:08.699
is that he's on the famous
Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

357
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.679
and he gets shot and wounded.

358
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.069
And when he's recuperating
from his wounds.

359
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.159
he's given morphine. heroin effectively.

360
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.493
And it's that that he becomes addicted to.

361
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.399
Goring is addicted to
morphine all the way through

362
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.949
from the Beer Hall
Putsch in '23. you know.

363
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.575
for another 23 years
until he dies in 1946.

364
00:18:33.576 --> 00:18:35.883
You know. it holds him back in many ways.

365
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.169
But he is a man who likes
the finest things in life.

366
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.179
And so when the Nazis do come to power.

367
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.189
and that's partly thanks to the fact

368
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.529
that Goring is such a capable politician.

369
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.869
and because he comes from a
pretty well-off background

370
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.839
and married to. you know. an aristocrat.

371
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.859
You know. he.

372
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.349
to some of the kind of
old school German bigwigs.

373
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.629
looks like the decent face of Nazism

374
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.309
because he's kind of a war hero

375
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.993
and quite an old school figure.

376
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.139
So he's absolutely instrumental

377
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.029
in helping the Nazis get into power.

378
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.111
and he consolidates a lot of power

379
00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:11.879
into his own pockets
and hands. if you like.

380
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.559
So he's in charge of the Prussian police.

381
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.809
He's initially in charge of the Gestapo.

382
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.129
the secret state police.

383
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.199
He's in charge of the Four Year Plan.

384
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.816
which is an important economic imperative.

385
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.109
This is a man with a lot of power.

386
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.593
and he uses it to
personally enrich himself.

387
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.869
When you look at pictures of
Goring throughout the war.

388
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.999
you just see this body getting
bigger. bigger and bigger.

389
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.393
and his uniforms getting
more and more ostentatious.

390
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.289
And he had like millions
of medals everywhere.

391
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.539
and the uniforms'd be like bright white

392
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.129
with gold all over them.

393
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.909
And he would have properties.
amazing hunting lodges.

394
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.649
He loved hunting.

395
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.109
And whenever the Nazis
conquered countries.

396
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.429
he'd be right at the front of it.

397
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.430
looting all the works of art.
statues. paintings. jewelry.

398
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.163
you name it. that would all
go into Goring's pocket.

399
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.819
He made himself almost impossibly rich.

400
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.469
And he also had vast appetites.

401
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.089
Not only for morphine.

402
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.416
but also for alcohol. for food. you know.

403
00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:23.841
for all the finest things in life.

404
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.099
And. in fact. he became a victim
of his own self-indulgence.

405
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.379
And when the Battle of Britain failed.

406
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.259
and when the German Air
Force was shown to be.

407
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.949
you know. inferior to a
smaller British Air Force.

408
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.626
he started. you know. to be
laughed at behind his back.

409
00:20:49.627 --> 00:20:51.329
You know. he became

410
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.749
this kind of drug-addled
alcoholic whale of a man

411
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.969
who other Nazis would laugh
at and not take seriously.

412
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.420
and saw him as an impediment.

413
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.429
By the end of the war.
he's this joke figure.

414
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.219
And it's at Nuremberg
when he's off the drugs.

415
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.569
when he loses weight.

416
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.669
his brain suddenly gets sharper again.

417
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.709
And of all the Nazis in
the dock at Nuremberg.

418
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.269
he's the most impressive.

419
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.329
And that old flash of
intelligence and brilliance

420
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.729
that's got him to the top of the Nazi tree

421
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.899
is shown once more.

422
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.509
And it's Goring who cheats the hangman

423
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.847
by committing suicide in his cell in 1946.

424
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.632
Does he get the last laugh?
In some ways. he does.

425
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.419
Rudolf Franz Ferdinand Hoss

426
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.209
was a German Schutzstaffel functionary

427
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.619
during the Nazi era.

428
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.113
who was later convicted as a war criminal.

429
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.246
He was the longest serving commandant

430
00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:58.623
of the Auschwitz concentration
and extermination camp.

431
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.919
He tested and implemented means

432
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.929
to accelerate Hitler's plan

433
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.109
to exterminate the Jewish
population systematically

434
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.269
and introduced Zyklon B.

435
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.843
containing hydrogen cyanide
used in the gas chambers.

436
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:16.409
Now. he was the
commandant of Auschwitz.

437
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.059
And as a result. as. you know.

438
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.369
probably got about a
million people. you know.

439
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.323
against his name. who he had murdered.

440
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.249
He typified the quiet

441
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.099
and bureaucratic mass murderer.

442
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.269
Very conscientious.

443
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.419
very determined to do his
job and to do it well.

444
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.699
And. of course. without much
thought for the victims.

445
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.739
So in terms of what he
was doing at Auschwitz.

446
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.259
trying to make a very efficient machine

447
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.659
and trying to do his
job well and properly.

448
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.429
His concern was not with the victims.

449
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.789
but just to make sure that the
apparatus was working well.

450
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.623
So in this case.

451
00:22:48.624 --> 00:22:52.081
to ensure that the gas chambers
could operate efficiently.

452
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.619
He treated the mass
murder that went on there

453
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.029
just as a kind of routine

454
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.099
and ordinary business as usual. really.

455
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.863
very much as a kind of
ordinary procedure and process.

456
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.589
He took pride in being
the first to use Zyklon B

457
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.549
as the gas used for the
gassing of his victims.

458
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.669
And he was so efficient
that. at Auschwitz.

459
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.429
2.5 million prisoners met their deaths.

460
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.019
So it's a massive death toll.

461
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.287
2.5 million deaths at Auschwitz.

462
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.889
He went into hiding
at the end of the war

463
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.359
on the advice of Heinrich Himmler.

464
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.699
his ultimate boss in the SS.

465
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.529
And Hoss disguises himself

466
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.503
and hides amongst various
German navy personnel.

467
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.359
He's eventually picked up by the British

468
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.729
who've actually interrogated his wife.

469
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.839
who's actually terrified

470
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.419
that she's gonna be tortured by the Brits

471
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.879
and she's basically spilled the beans.

472
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.309
So Hoss is brought to justice.

473
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.679
And there is this extraordinary image

474
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.879
of a British war crimes officer
actually confronting Hoss.

475
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.609
who looks like this
completely pathetic figure.

476
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.619
You know. looking absolutely terrified

477
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.539
while this sort of tall
British Army officer

478
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.369
is just basically shouting at him.

479
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.210
And it shows. you know.

480
00:24:09.211 --> 00:24:10.589
basically. this man who had power

481
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.689
of life and death over millions of people

482
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.179
is reduced to this pathetic figure.

483
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.089
Now. the British hand
him over to the Poles.

484
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.269
And it's the Poles who
actually bring him to justice.

485
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.343
and it's the Poles who hang him.

486
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.299
We had two SS
doctors on duty at Auschwitz

487
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.239
to examine the incoming
transports of prisoners.

488
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.459
Prisoners would be marched
past one of the doctors

489
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.309
who would make spot
decisions as they walked by.

490
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.249
Those who were fit for work
were sent into the camp.

491
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.249
Others were sent immediately
to the extermination plant.

492
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.009
Children of tender years
were invariably exterminated

493
00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.519
since by reasons of their
youth. they were unable to work.

494
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.499
We endeavored to fool them into thinking

495
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.053
they were to go through
a delousing process.

496
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.416
It took from 3 to 15
minutes to kill the people

497
00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:00.749
in the death chamber.

498
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.359
depending upon climatic conditions.

499
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.339
We knew when the people were dead

500
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.940
because their screaming stopped.

501
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.259
We usually waited about one half hour

502
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.259
before we opened the doors
and removed the bodies.

503
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.819
After the bodies were removed.

504
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.009
our special commanders took off the rings

505
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.863
and extracted the gold from
the teeth of the corpses.

506
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.939
He was brought before
a Polish military tribunal.

507
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.940
And he was found guilty. and
he was executed in April. 1947.

508
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.049
Was taken back to Auschwitz

509
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.859
to outside the house where
he and his family had lived.

510
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.129
and he was executed there.

511
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.289
He was executed there at the
place where he had lived.

512
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.339
and at the place where he had
sent millions of people to die

513
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.073
during his time as
commandant at Auschwitz.

514
00:26:04.471 --> 00:26:06.119
Otto Adolf Eichmann

515
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.809
was a German-Austrian
SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer

516
00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.049
and one of the major
organizers of the Holocaust.

517
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.439
the "Final Solution to
the Jewish question."

518
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.033
in Nazi terminology.

519
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.389
Eichmann quickly became known

520
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.729
as the world's most wanted Nazi.

521
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.939
Branded the architect
of the Final Solution

522
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.653
to exterminate Jews.

523
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.189
He was seen as the mastermind

524
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.139
behind the network of death camps

525
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.849
that resulted in the murder

526
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.843
of approximately 6 million people.

527
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.539
He orchestrated the identification.

528
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.779
assembly. and transportation
of European Jews

529
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.613
to Auschwitz. Treblinka. and
other death camps in Poland.

530
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.319
Adolf Eichmann was in charge

531
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.579
of the Office for Jewish
Emigration in Vienna. first of all.

532
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.419
So he kind of. sort of rose
to a prominent position

533
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.639
after the Anschluss in 1938.

534
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.529
And essentially he was responsible

535
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:12.530
for the forced removal or
relocation of first Vienna's

536
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.659
and then the rest of Austria's Jews.

537
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.609
And then. of course.
for the forced removal

538
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.719
of all of the European Jews
who were under Nazi rule

539
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.849
as the years went on.

540
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.479
Eichmann today is an
incredibly notorious name.

541
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.019
and we all today know
him to be the man he was.

542
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.969
You know. he's famously
and notoriously called

543
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.369
the architect of the Final Solution.

544
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.203
What he was.

545
00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:38.189
was in charge of a department

546
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.259
of the Reich Security Main Office.

547
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.509
and it was called Department IV-B4.

548
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.689
It was part of the Gestapo.
the secret state police.

549
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.889
And his job was to basically
wage war against the Jews.

550
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.689
And it was Eichmann's job

551
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.690
was to help facilitate the
destruction of the Jewish people.

552
00:27:57.725 --> 00:28:00.089
He was responsible
for registering. assembling.

553
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.429
and then transporting the Jews

554
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.843
from different assembly points
to the death camps in Poland.

555
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.019
In December. 1939.

556
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.349
he sort of took on a more
important or kind of bigger role

557
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.929
within the Gestapo as head

558
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.709
of the Jewish Office of the
Reich Main Security Office.

559
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.919
And so. again. the main
point of that role really

560
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.609
was to orchestrate and
carry out the removal

561
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.603
of all of the European Jews
to the death camps in Poland.

562
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.419
He was effectively the guy.

563
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.799
didn't come up with the policy.

564
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.529
but he was the guy who
zealously implemented it.

565
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.229
And he knew that if he was captured.

566
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.510
he would face the noose.

567
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.649
Eichmann was arrested
at the end of the war.

568
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.859
but his name wasn't very
well known at that stage.

569
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.790
He managed to escape

570
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:55.169
from an American internment camp in 1946.

571
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.589
He decided to
call himself Eckmann.

572
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.479
and then he managed to. you know.

573
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.099
go into hiding for quite a
few years in Germany on farms.

574
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.189
And he tried to sort of recreate his life

575
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.699
as a kind of. you know. humble
son of the soil. if you like.

576
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.129
But actually by the late 1940s.

577
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.069
he realizes that things
are getting a bit hot.

578
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.859
He suspects that war crimes
units may be after him.

579
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.489
And what he does is that he
eventually flees to Argentina.

580
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.383
where he tries to create a new life.

581
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:33.029
Eventually. in 1960.
the Israeli Secret Services.

582
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.649
after quite a lot of detective work.

583
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.419
managed to find him.

584
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.179
And then came into place an operation

585
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.179
really to smuggle him out of Argentina

586
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.563
and to bring him to Israel
in order to stand trial.

587
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.189
- Behind this fence.

588
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.429
the pages of history are being turned back

589
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.849
to one of the most terrible
chapters of our time.

590
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.089
Adolf Eichmann faces probably
the most appalling list

591
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.393
of charges ever to be leveled
against a single human being.

592
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.439
But if Eichmann's is the
name on the charge sheet.

593
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.749
the Israelis have made very clear

594
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.913
who they think is really in the dock.

595
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.723
In the building where
Eichmann is being tried.

596
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.599
the Israelis are trying

597
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.509
to place before the
conscience of the world

598
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:26.510
the full facts of how the Nazis
in Germany tried. literally.

599
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.843
to exterminate millions of
the Jewish people in Europe.

600
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:36.629
Now. to us. the Nazi persecution
is 15 years or more away.

601
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.519
but to the people living here.

602
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.713
it's still a sharp memory.

603
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:45.389
The children playing in
the warm spring sunshine.

604
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.039
the older people going
about their everyday lives.

605
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:55.040
many of them had relatives who
died in Hitler's gas ovens.

606
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.943
And even here in Israel.
they found no peaceful haven.

607
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.539
Just over a mile up the road from here.

608
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.540
there's a barbed wire fence
and sentries stand guard.

609
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.639
This is the border
across which Israel looks

610
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.273
to an implacably hostile Arab neighbor.

611
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.673
To the people of Israel.

612
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.289
persecution. personified by Eichmann.

613
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.093
is still a living danger.

614
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.569
For now in this city of Jerusalem.

615
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.809
which itself is no stranger to history.

616
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.489
let us look back at the moment

617
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.652
when this historic trial began.

618
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.209
In Jerusalem.

619
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.459
the trial of Adolf Eichmann begins.

620
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.559
reviving memories of the Nazi horrors

621
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.179
of the Second World War.

622
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.239
Entering the bulletproof
prisoners box is the man charged

623
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.669
with the annihilation of millions of Jews

624
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.085
in Nazi death camps.

625
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.849
Searching problems of conscience

626
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.969
and of international law
will be raised by this trial.

627
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.493
one of the most stirring of modern times.

628
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.359
Eichmann himself is impassive

629
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.539
as the three judges who
will decide his fate enter.

630
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.729
Now. after 15 years in hiding

631
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.119
and one year after his sensational
abduction from Argentina.

632
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.969
Adolf Eichmann is indicted on 15 counts

633
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.949
of crimes against the Jewish people

634
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.569
and crimes against humanity.

635
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.458
The accused.
together with the others.

636
00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:26.879
during a period of 1939 to 1945.

637
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.389
caused the killing of millions
of Jews in his capacity

638
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.879
as the person responsible
for the execution

639
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.349
of the Nazi plan for the physical
extermination of the Jews.

640
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.083
known as the Final Solution
of the Jewish problem.

641
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.729
Eichmann's
attorney. Dr. Robert Servatius.

642
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.489
opens by denying the legality of the trial

643
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.439
and questions the jurisdiction obtained

644
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.449
by Eichmann's forcible capture.

645
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.629
Dr. Servatius further suggests
that Eichmann be tried

646
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.108
by a neutral or international tribunal.

647
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.389
Israeli attorney general. Gideon Hausner.

648
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.046
the chief prosecutor replies.

649
00:33:05.047 --> 00:33:07.139
"That no one except the state of Israel

650
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.299
has sought to bring Eichmann to justice."

651
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.609
And cites the Nuremberg war crimes trials

652
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.439
as precedent for this trial.

653
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.169
Throughout. Eichmann remains icy calm.

654
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.233
his fate. at last. in
the scales of justice.

655
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.489
The trial. which
opened in April. 1961.

656
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:27.659
was very controversial.

657
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.169
But it also. of course.
attracted a great deal

658
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.188
of international attention as well.

659
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.150
When he was questioned.

660
00:33:36.151 --> 00:33:38.279
he claimed that he was
only following orders.

661
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.639
He claimed not to be responsible
for any of the executions.

662
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.373
and said he was just
involved in transportation.

663
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.129
So. again. that's the kind of line used

664
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.299
about following orders

665
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.189
and not really admitting responsibility

666
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.758
for the Final Solution.

667
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560
Yes.

668
00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.149
With regard to the Jews.

669
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.586
my only obligations were those
concerned with emigration.

670
00:34:04.587 --> 00:34:08.159
And this transpires from
the official designation

671
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:08.993
of the department.

672
00:34:08.994 --> 00:34:11.819
which was called
Emigration and Evacuation.

673
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.669
Emigration. that applied to the Jews.

674
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.670
while evacuation. that concerned
the sphere of jurisdiction

675
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.049
of the Reichskommissar

676
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.813
for strengthening the
basis of the German nation.

677
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.743
a post to which Himmler
was then appointed.

678
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.499
And this concerned the evacuation

679
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.499
of the newly annexed areas in the East.

680
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.493
which were annexed to the Reich.

681
00:34:42.687 --> 00:34:45.569
And as Hitler and Himmler
had ordered at that time.

682
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:50.009
these areas had to be evacuated of Jews

683
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.869
and other foreign nationalities.

684
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.909
And my connection with this

685
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.759
was strictly from the
point of view of timetables

686
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.103
and technical transport problems.

687
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.039
I do not remember
it in detail. Your Honor.

688
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.759
I do not remember the
circumstances of this conversation.

689
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.819
but I do know that these
gentlemen were standing together

690
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.259
or sitting together

691
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.609
and were discussing this
subject quite bluntly.

692
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.079
quite differently from the language

693
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.599
which I had to use later in the record.

694
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.649
During the conversation.

695
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.423
they minced no words about it at all.

696
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.309
I might say.
furthermore. Your Honor.

697
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.600
that I would not have remembered this

698
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.129
unless I had later remember

699
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.369
that I told myself. look here.

700
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.330
I told myself.

701
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:47.489
even this guy. Stuckart.

702
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.439
who was known as one of these uncles

703
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.249
who was a great stickler for legalities.

704
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.789
he too uses language

705
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.609
which is not at all in accordance

706
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.879
with the spirit of paragraphs of the law.

707
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.809
This incident remained
engraved in my memory

708
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.273
and recalls the entire subject to my mind.

709
00:37:17.556 --> 00:37:21.389
Eichmann was sentenced
to death in December. 1961.

710
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.662
and he was executed in May. 1962.

711
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.439
Rudolf Walter Richard Hess

712
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.119
was a German politician

713
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.513
and a leading member of the
Nazi Party in Nazi Germany.

714
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.639
Appointed Deputy Fuhrer
to Adolf Hitler in 1933.

715
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.029
Hess served in that position until 1941

716
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.189
when he flew solo to Scotland

717
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.279
in an attempt to negotiate
peace with the United Kingdom

718
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.487
during World War II.

719
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.119
Rudolph Hess noticed that
the Fuhrer was preoccupied

720
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.869
and decided to take
matters into his own hands.

721
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.749
He decided to end the
continuing military struggle

722
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.903
between Germany and the
Allies using a peace pact.

723
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.249
He secretly flies solo over Britain

724
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.709
and lands in Scotland by parachute.

725
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.543
hoping to speak

726
00:38:35.544 --> 00:38:37.773
with one of the highly-placed
British figures.

727
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.099
He intended to offer respect

728
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.436
for the integrity of the British Empire.

729
00:38:43.437 --> 00:38:46.109
for Germany to have a free hand in Europe

730
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.393
and the return of German colonies.

731
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.419
Of course. as soon as he
was found out to be a Nazi.

732
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.329
he was arrested and treated
as a prisoner of war.

733
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.093
held in a British prison
until the war's end.

734
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.909
Once Hitler hears of his
plan and capture in Britain.

735
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.339
he declares Hess has committed treason

736
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.952
and the Nazis reject him.

737
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.419
- Rudolph Hess was a very
troubled man in many ways.

738
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.259
and you only have to look at
his somewhat uneven expressions

739
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.519
whenever he's captured on film.

740
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.619
He's got these very sort of thick brows.

741
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.589
and he looks like he's puzzling
about the world in general.

742
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.829
He was a very sort of troubled man.

743
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.530
and he was devoted to Hitler
from the very early days.

744
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.789
And it was Hess who
was in Landsberg Prison

745
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.609
after the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

746
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.189
And it was Hess who was
by kind of Hitler's side.

747
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.629
you know. all the way
through those sort of.

748
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.020
kind of very dark years.

749
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.389
You know. as Hitler gained more power.

750
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.119
Hitler is loyal to Hess because
Hess has been loyal to him.

751
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.100
and he makes him Deputy Fuhrer.

752
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.859
But it's clear that as the
Nazi Party has come to power

753
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.169
and its popularity and its ability

754
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.179
to draw on talent has increased.

755
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.399
it's basically shown up Hess

756
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.099
to be the kind of real
second or third rater

757
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.119
that he actually is.

758
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.949
He's not really a very impressive figure.

759
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.599
You know. what does he offer. you know.

760
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.249
the Nazi regime who are out control?

761
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:17.339
He doesn't have any
great personal charisma

762
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.659
that's gonna draw people in.

763
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.999
He doesn't really have any particular kind

764
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.249
of administrative skills.

765
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.203
You know. what he is. is just loyal.

766
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.649
He's kind of totally out of his depth

767
00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.419
by the time Hitler comes into power.

768
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.339
His usefulness is no longer there.

769
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.674
and he's really. basically
very much sidelined

770
00:40:35.675 --> 00:40:37.319
by the outbreak of war.

771
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.899
And it makes him very sort
of desperate to. you know.

772
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.249
curry favor with Hitler.

773
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.399
And so he carries out this
absolutely extraordinary mission.

774
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.299
Takes off from a
Messerschmitt 110 in Augsburg.

775
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.299
and flies to Scotland. obviously.

776
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.309
where he parachutes out to land

777
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.199
on the land of the Duke of Hamilton.

778
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.509
who he thinks is a friend of his.

779
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.879
And he says. you know.
I'm here to basically.

780
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.692
you know. forge a peace deal.
That. you know. if. you know.

781
00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:06.449
you allow Nazi Germany to
have a free hand in Europe.

782
00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.849
we'll allow the British Empire

783
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.619
and British colonies a free hand.

784
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.029
and for Britain to maintain her influence

785
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.319
all over the world.

786
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.539
And of course. this is
just complete nonsense.

787
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.539
You know. Churchill. by this
stage. is in no. you know.

788
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.129
mood to start listening

789
00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:24.089
to what is clearly a
semi-deranged individual.

790
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.179
And. indeed. he just remains in prison.

791
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.699
you know. locked up
until the end of the war.

792
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.249
And then he's put on trial at Nuremberg.

793
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.019
And by then. he's gone mad.

794
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.159
He seems very kind of withdrawn. troubled.

795
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.199
And he is sentenced at Nuremberg.

796
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.037
but he's not sentenced to death.

797
00:41:41.038 --> 00:41:43.559
And he actually lives in Spandau Prison

798
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.659
until his death many decades later

799
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.393
as this very kind of
cryptic. enigmatic figure.

800
00:42:01.405 --> 00:42:02.759
Josef Mengele.

801
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.189
also known as the Angel of Death.

802
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:08.009
was a German Schutzstaffel. SS. officer

803
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.083
and physician during World War II.

804
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.409
He is mainly remembered

805
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.159
for his actions at the
Auschwitz concentration camp.

806
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.339
where he performed deadly
experiments on prisoners.

807
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.409
He was a member of the team of doctors

808
00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.799
who selected victims to be
killed in the gas chambers

809
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.743
and was one of the doctors
who administered the gas.

810
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.809
A doctor. nicknamed the Angel of Death.

811
00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.569
conducted macabre
experiments on the prisoners

812
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:41.223
at the Auschwitz death camp.

813
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.419
He started as an SS officer.

814
00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.629
was sent at the start of World
War II to the Eastern Front.

815
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.449
to repel the Soviets and
received an Iron Cross

816
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.533
for his bravery.

817
00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.479
After being wounded and
cleared unfit for active duty.

818
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.399
he was assigned to Auschwitz

819
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.829
and used prisoners as guinea pigs.

820
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.429
particularly women.
twins. and the disabled.

821
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.379
and tortured and killed children

822
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.200
with his medical experiments.

823
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.899
After being wounded and
cleared unfit for active duty.

824
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.759
he was assigned to Auschwitz

825
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.039
and used prisoners as guinea pigs.

826
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.040
particularly women. twins.
and people with disabilities

827
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.299
and tortured and killed children

828
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.690
with his medical experiments.

829
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.159
It was Mengele's
job to be one of those

830
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.949
who selected which prisoners

831
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.989
were to go straight to the gas chambers

832
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.029
when they arrived by train at Auschwitz.

833
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.759
and which prisoners should
be allowed to go and work

834
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.529
for a few months until
they worked themselves.

835
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:47.579
or for a few weeks.

836
00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.279
until they worked themselves to death.

837
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.699
But what he also did
with his medical hat on

838
00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.309
was to experiment on twins.

839
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:59.909
He was absolutely fascinated by twins

840
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:03.539
from a kind of anthropological
level. from a medical level.

841
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.659
And what medics like with twins is

842
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.629
that you have two people
who are identical.

843
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.349
and you can compare and contrast

844
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.029
what happens to them medically.

845
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.189
Now. ethically. you can't. you know.

846
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:21.059
in most normal societies.
introduce one twin

847
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.179
to some disease and the
other one not to receive it.

848
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.619
and then to see how they do.

849
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.269
You could do that in Auschwitz

850
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.213
because Mengele had all
these live human guinea pigs.

851
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.169
But medical
experiments took place

852
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:40.319
at a number of the concentration
camps across Germany.

853
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.799
including Dachau.
Buchenwald. Sachsenhausen.

854
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.377
Natzweiler. and Ravensbruck.

855
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.889
- We arrived to Auschwitz

856
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:57.890
and there was some Jewish
people came up the train.

857
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:02.930
He said to us. whatever we do.
don't say that we are sick.

858
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.839
And we stand in the line.

859
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.829
And Mengele was sitting there.

860
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.573
Dr. Mengele they called him.

861
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.980
And left. right. you know?

862
00:45:19.448 --> 00:45:24.448
They announced every young woman

863
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.679
should take the baby.

864
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.309
give the children to the
elderly. to the mothers.

865
00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:29.823
to the elderly people.

866
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.323
Then when we came in the
line. you know. Mengele.

867
00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:42.839
he said. in German he talked
to us. if we are healthy.

868
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.939
we are sick. or something is hurting us.

869
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.234
He talk so nice. so
soft. you know. things.

870
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:06.659
- In my case. never ever talked to me.

871
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.819
He talked about me.

872
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.709
He talked at me.

873
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.389
You have to realize.

874
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:17.069
Mengele did not treat us as human beings.

875
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:21.967
We were just his treasured
experiment subjects.

876
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.089
We would stand by our bunk beds

877
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.099
with our hands behind our back

878
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.643
like little soldiers for
Mengele's inspection.

879
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.029
There was two.

880
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.513
we had three supervisors in
our barrack. Blockalteste.

881
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.806
And one of them would
stand at the front and say.

882
00:46:43.807 --> 00:46:46.526
"Mengele is coming."

883
00:46:46.527 --> 00:46:48.269
And everybody would just.

884
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.709
it's like some kind of
a horror was entering.

885
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:57.710
He would come very elegantly
with his hands behind his back.

886
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.249
He had a stick in his hand.

887
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.189
He would hit it sometime
against his riding boots

888
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.363
and start counting.

889
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.289
He always had at least
six people with him.

890
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.136
Many times. as many as 8 or 10.

891
00:47:09.137 --> 00:47:10.994
It was a big entourage.

892
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.309
He had power
of life and death over.

893
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.049
you know. hundreds of thousands of people.

894
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.869
And he committed the
most vile experiments.

895
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.329
on twins and all sorts of other people.

896
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.739
And so he knew at the end of the war

897
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.599
that he would have to go into hiding.

898
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.986
because there would be people
who had survived Auschwitz

899
00:47:28.987 --> 00:47:32.519
who would be giving
testimony about his savagery

900
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.019
and his barbarism.

901
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.079
And what he does. like so
many other Nazi figures.

902
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.199
he disappears to a farm.

903
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.078
And where he ends up working.

904
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:45.239
you know. along with sort
of normal farm laborers.

905
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.219
but it's clear he's a much
more intellectual figure

906
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.269
than those around him.

907
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.389
They all know that he's. you
know. got something to hide.

908
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:55.199
And also what Mengele has
is a very wealthy background

909
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.159
because the Mengele family
produced farm machinery

910
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.319
in Southern Germany for decades.

911
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.299
And so. effectively. the
family were millionaires.

912
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.239
And so when Mengele decides to hotfoot it

913
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.279
to Argentina in 1949.

914
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.679
he's got the backing of a family fortune

915
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.023
to really help smooth his way over there.

916
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.339
What's really chilling
about Mengele is that.

917
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.139
throughout the rest of his life.

918
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.159
he always would justify what
he had done in Auschwitz.

919
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.039
He had always thought he had
done the morally correct thing.

920
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.579
He would see his work on the
selection ramps for starters.

921
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.379
saying to people. you know.

922
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.299
well. you're gonna live
and you're gonna die.

923
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.309
You know. we see that as
sending people to their deaths.

924
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:39.149
Mengele saw that as sending
people to their continued life

925
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:40.379
because he had this attitude

926
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.209
that everybody there was gonna die anyway.

927
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.369
So in fact. he was. you know.
kind of delaying their deaths.

928
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:45.959
He was being the nice guy.

929
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.950
You know. that's absurd.

930
00:48:46.951 --> 00:48:49.349
And he also would say that
the experiments he did

931
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.059
were for the good of humanity.

932
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.109
that this was.

933
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:56.763
an essential role of medicine
was to experiment on people.

934
00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.609
It was ultimately beneficial.

935
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.319
You know. he would come
up with all sorts of

936
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.829
kind of pseudo-academic kind of verbiage

937
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:06.722
to kind of justify what he had done.

938
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.409
It took a long time for the German people

939
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:11.879
to really come to terms

940
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.439
with what had been done in their name.

941
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.262
I think a lot of German
people throughout the war

942
00:49:15.263 --> 00:49:17.519
had had more than an inkling.

943
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.559
but I don't think they knew the extent

944
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.929
of the savagery of what went on.

945
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:25.679
you know. behind those miles
upon miles of barbed wire.

946
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.939
and inside those huts.

947
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.299
and inside those chambers
of death. effectively.

948
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.269
And I think that when it was
finally revealed to them.

949
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:36.839
and when. you know.
justice started being done.

950
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.359
I think any reasonable
German started realizing

951
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.200
that actually. yes.

952
00:49:40.201 --> 00:49:42.329
there should be some form of retribution.

953
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.889
But I think also there was also a feeling.

954
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.709
not just in Germany. but
also amongst the Allies.

955
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.829
that you couldn't spend decade upon decade

956
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.589
carrying out tens of
thousands of man hunts

957
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.100
for all these people.

958
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.029
What Nuremberg represents

959
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:05.609
to so many of these
Nazis is a real reckoning

960
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.729
that they never thought
they were gonna receive.

961
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.249
Maybe some of the smarter ones
in the dying days of the war

962
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.569
thought maybe. uh-oh.

963
00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.869
But actually the whole idea
of the Reich was not meant

964
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:16.830
to be a 12-year Reich.

965
00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:19.379
It was supposed to be
a Thousand-Year Reich.

966
00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.999
And in fact. that what was gonna happen

967
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.419
is that people were gonna be
treating them as demigods.

968
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.459
and statues would be erected

969
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.439
and buildings enshrined to them.

970
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.479
you know. for hundreds of years.

971
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.359
not actually hanging from some grubby rope

972
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.159
in the prison courtyard in Nuremberg.

973
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.120
which is what happened to them.

974
00:50:36.121 --> 00:50:38.939
So they went from kind of being demigods

975
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.403
to criminal lowlife very quickly.

976
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.739
The Nuremberg trials
represented a very important.

977
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:51.419
unprecedented moment and a way
for the Allied powers really

978
00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:55.019
to bring to justice some
of those key Nazi leaders

979
00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.259
as representatives of
key Nazi organizations

980
00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.579
who had carried out

981
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.089
such unspeakably cruel acts of war crimes.

982
00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:06.809
crimes against humanity. and
crimes against the peace.

983
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:08.466
It was very radical at the time.

984
00:51:08.467 --> 00:51:10.019
There had never been

985
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.569
an international criminal court like it.

986
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.819
And so this was a kind of coming together

987
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.489
of a lot of different legal systems.

988
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.679
a lot of different political systems.

989
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.839
But what it was saying
to the world was. listen.

990
00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.669
these people who commit war crimes.

991
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.619
these people who commit genocide.

992
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:28.049
these people who commit
crimes against humanity.

993
00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:31.743
they are never ever going to
get away with it ever again.
