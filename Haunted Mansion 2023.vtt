00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:56.515
<i>Welcome. Foolish Mortals. to New Orleans.</i>

4
00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:59.560
<i>A most paranormal place.</i>

5
00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.857
<i>Where somber funerals end in celebration.</i>

6
00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.027
<i>Where death is not an ending...</i>

7
00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.488
<i>but a new beginning.</i>

8
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.702
<i>And even grief can be a doorway to joy...</i>

9
00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.873
<i>if one is willing to walk through it.</i>

10
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.381
It's 11:58! Let's get ready.

11
00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.848
- Wow.
- Hey. excuse me. bartender.

12
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.604
Sorry. sorry. Excuse me. bartender.
Can I get a drink? Okay.

13
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.022
Here.

14
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:47.649
You can have mine.

15
00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:50.444
Then you won't have any.

16
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.237
That's fine. I'm not drinking much.

17
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:54.907
Maybe we could share it.

18
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.241
Yeah.

19
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.452
Are you here with somebody?

20
00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.536
Yes.

21
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.913
I am here with my co-workers...

22
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.498
who are right behind me.
I'm sure. being very awkward.

23
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.085
What is it that you do?

24
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.213
I'm an astrophysicist.

25
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.673
That's like...

26
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.592
a rocket scientist.

27
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.553
- More "optics." I create lenses.
- Optics.

28
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.431
For instance. I'm currently working
on a formula to map dark matter...

29
00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:21.517
by combining instructions
we already have in place...

30
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.227
with what we're learning
from quantum mechanics...

31
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.394
and it's really quite complicated. but...

32
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.105
Yeah. sounds like
you're trying to see the unseen.

33
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.316
That's exactly what I'm doing.

34
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.984
But you said it in a much better way.

35
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.362
Okay. I kind of...

36
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.489
I kind of do the same thing.

37
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.032
I give ghost tours.

38
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.869
So. you don't do the same thing at all.

39
00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.330
Not at all. but it's kinda like it.

40
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.750
I help people see things
they can't always see.

41
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.502
Like ghosts flying through the air.

42
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:49.711
- Apparitions...
- Ten!

43
00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.547
- ...spirits flying through walls...
- Nine! Eight!

44
00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.882
- ...and possessing people.
- You're making fun of me...

45
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.175
Seven!

46
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.469
- ...but come on one of my tours.
- Six! Five!

47
00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:58.720
- Yeah.
- Four!

48
00:02:58.887 --> 00:02:59.721
Yes.

49
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.975
Three! Two! One!

50
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.394
Happy New Year!

51
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.439
I'm Ben.

52
00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:11.984
Alyssa.

53
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.403
<i>Ben?</i>

54
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.364
<i>Ben!</i>

55
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.037
Ben?

56
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.918
Listen. I hate to pile on top of
what I assume is a bad day...

57
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.503
but this thing isn't working.

58
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.548
What makes you think I'm having a bad day?

59
00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.175
Why am I assuming
that you're having a bad day?

60
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.177
'Cause you smell like yesterday.

61
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.680
Here.

62
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:44.975
How many are out there?

63
00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.269
- Seven.
- Okay. seven.

64
00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:49.104
Why are you still leading her tour?

65
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.647
Look. I can sneak you out the back.

66
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.566
No. they'll follow me.

67
00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:55.360
They always do.

68
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:56.778
Yeah.

69
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:01.074
Are you Ben. our tour guide?

70
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.327
- Yes. I am.
- I'm from Syracuse.

71
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.787
Great. we're gonna read some names.
That's what we're gonna do.

72
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.165
And I wanna hear H-E-R-E. the word "here"...

73
00:04:08.332 --> 00:04:10.083
and that's the only word I need to hear.
got it?

74
00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:13.670
- So it looks like we have a "John Peluso"?
- Present.

75
00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.422
Been an accountant for almost 50 years.

76
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.673
I don't care.

77
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.926
It looks like we also have a Carol...

78
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.177
Here!

79
00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.095
I'm a Carol. Are you a Carol?

80
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.265
Yeah. I mean. that's so funny!

81
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.227
Carol's a very common name.

82
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.069
Isn't this building supposed to be haunted?

83
00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:39.947
This is an historical walking tour.
Hey. hey. hey.

84
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.157
I will show you things.
and I will talk about them.

85
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:43.367
No ghost stories.

86
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:49.957
So...

87
00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.710
I hear that this cathedral here...
That has ghosts.

88
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.337
No such thing as ghosts.

89
00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:56.755
I believe in ghosts.

90
00:04:56.922 --> 00:05:01.885
My aunt Barbara. she was an avid birder
and she adored hummingbirds.

91
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.555
Day of her funeral. what do we see?

92
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.722
A hummingbird!

93
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.391
Okay. Carols...

94
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:10.644
let me impart a little bit of truth
on to you.

95
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:14.022
I've been in every "haunted house"...

96
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.983
in the most haunted city in the world.

97
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.151
I've even been in that building.
Seventy-two hours.

98
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:19.820
You wanna know what I found?

99
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.448
Nothing. Not a thing.

100
00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.702
Ghosts don't exist. Life is dirt.
We're all dirt!

101
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.500
Sorry...

102
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.169
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.421
All right. come on.

104
00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.495
Welcome home.

105
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.168
{\an8}Hey.

106
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.505
{\an8}It's the movers.

107
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:04.216
{\an8}Yeah. we're here. How close are you?

108
00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:07.219
{\an8}How are you four hours behind?
We left at the same time.

109
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.640
{\an8}Yeah.
No. I understand a lunch break...

110
00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.892
{\an8}but this sounds a little bit more
like dinner and a movie.

111
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.688
{\an8}We'll see you when we see you.

112
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.148
{\an8}These movers.

113
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.068
{\an8}Travis?

114
00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.237
{\an8}I'm over here. Mom.

115
00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:27.698
{\an8}Just checking out the house.

116
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.337
{\an8}It's time. It's time. Someone's here.

117
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.714
{\an8}Places everyone. Places.

118
00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.344
He can see us.

119
00:08:05.277 --> 00:08:08.447
This place is going to be great
when we fix it up.

120
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.161
{\an8}Wow.

121
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.704
{\an8}You want to pick out your room?

122
00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:18.749
{\an8}It's probably upstairs.

123
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.084
{\an8}- Love it?
- No.

124
00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.162
Not today.

125
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.535
Welcome home!

126
00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:43.876
No. no. no!

127
00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:54.303
Pumpkin. What's wrong?

128
00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.555
This place is haunted!

129
00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:57.848
All right. now. hang on.

130
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:01.518
Now. I know this place
isn't as warm as I had hoped.

131
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.938
But I think we get some daylight in here.
it's gonna feel better.

132
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.860
Hey. I'm gonna light a vanilla candle
and it's gonna be a game changer.

133
00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:11.820
Will it though?

134
00:10:12.863 --> 00:10:16.074
Sweetie. I need you
to give this place a chance.

135
00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:17.784
This is our home now.

136
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.542
Nah. We're out.

137
00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:32.549
No. no.

138
00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.427
Come on. get in the car.
Get in the car.

139
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.764
- Seat belts. Safety first.
- Why won't it...

140
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:40.599
- Slow. slow. you got this. you got this.
- Okay.

141
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:41.892
- Mommy's got you.
- Okay.

142
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:44.269
Don't you worry about it.
I love antiques. but not that much!

143
00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.907
You'll be back.

144
00:10:57.074 --> 00:10:59.576
You'll be back.

145
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:13.799
Okay. okay. I got it. Alyssa.

146
00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.061
Excuse me. hey. do you know
the guy who lives here?

147
00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:28.522
Yeah. But he's not very friendly.

148
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:35.404
Hello?

149
00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.411
- So. this is how a genius lives.
- What are you doing?

150
00:11:42.578 --> 00:11:44.079
Take it easy. take it easy.
I'm not a thief!

151
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:46.665
Look. No. the treasures I seek
are in heaven.

152
00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:49.042
What kind of psychopath
just enters someone's house?

153
00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:53.547
I'm sorry. I know opportunity usually knocks.
but sometimes it just can't wait.

154
00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:55.299
- Like right now.
- What?

155
00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.634
Why are you...
Why do you have a cat?

156
00:11:57.843 --> 00:11:59.386
- This isn't yours?
- No.

157
00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:02.306
I thought it was yours.
He was beggin' to get in.

158
00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:05.893
Onwards. my furry friend. Onwards.

159
00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:09.229
I guess the little guy just could feel
all the positive energy...

160
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.397
flowin' out of this...

161
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:13.317
charming apartment.

162
00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.444
Should we crack a window?

163
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.906
I'm Father Kent. by the way.

164
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.574
Hi. Kent.

165
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:23.493
- You mind if I take a seat?
- Absolutely. I mind.

166
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.661
Okay. okay.

167
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.122
Listen. one question and then I leave.

168
00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:29.958
You wanna be a hero?

169
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.252
Pass.

170
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.922
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Goodbye.

171
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.048
Two words.

172
00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:38.008
Spectral Photography.

173
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:39.843
Yeah.

174
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.345
That catch your attention?

175
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:43.430
Because it sure caught mine.

176
00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:47.643
Did you really create
a camera strong enough...

177
00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.145
to capture something
called the "ghost particle"?

178
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.315
No. I never called it that.
That was the press.

179
00:12:53.482 --> 00:12:56.485
Anyway. I was professionally ridiculed.

180
00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:58.111
Hey. Dr. Frankenstein.

181
00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.365
There's a man of science.
and they came at him with pitchforks.

182
00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:02.533
And why?

183
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.076
For trying to create something.

184
00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:05.953
He created a monster. all right?

185
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.206
That. if I'm not mistaken.
killed a few people. I think. right?

186
00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:12.459
Hey. one man's monster
is another man's great Halloween costume.

187
00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:15.963
- Wow. mind blown. Okay. let's go.
- Okay. hear me out.

188
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.215
I got a call from a really sweet woman.

189
00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:20.092
She has a lovely little kid...

190
00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:21.802
and they think their house is haunted.

191
00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:24.221
She wanted me to perform an exorcism...

192
00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:26.849
but what I think we need is...

193
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.267
a paranormal expert.

194
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.019
- I'm a tour guide.
- You're Ben Matthias.

195
00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.355
You worked at the Space Center.
building telescopes.

196
00:13:33.522 --> 00:13:36.608
Before that. you were an astrophysicist
at CERN.

197
00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.861
Now. you're giving walking tours?

198
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:42.197
That's like having Michael Jordan
play baseball.

199
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.616
Let's put you in the game where you belong.

200
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.034
Playing the right position.

201
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.245
That woman is probably out of her wits.

202
00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:50.414
There's no such thing as ghosts.

203
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:51.707
Then what's the harm in just...

204
00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:55.711
You drive an hour north.
you snap a few pics with the ghost camera...

205
00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.421
and you put their mind at ease.

206
00:13:57.588 --> 00:13:59.715
I am not driving an hour anywhere to...

207
00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:00.883
She'll pay.

208
00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:03.343
$2.000.

209
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.678
What's the address?

210
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.388
Money talks.

211
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:08.182
Hey. it talks to me. too. But. shh!

212
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.349
Don't say anything.

213
00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:12.019
The big man upstairs is always watching...

214
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.521
and he keeps me on a really short leash.

215
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.065
- Yeah. not short enough.
- Hey. listen.

216
00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.026
My job is having faith...

217
00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.819
and I got faith in you.

218
00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:49.640
<i>You know how you and I are so different.
but when we come together it's really good?</i>

219
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.141
<i>Agreed.</i>

220
00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.978
Well. this is like a bridge
from what you do to what I do.

221
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.313
Right? So. look. I got this.

222
00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:00.567
What are you...

223
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:04.238
It's a lens.

224
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:08.075
- It's a lens!
- Careful.

225
00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:09.701
A quantum lens...

226
00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.496
which. if everything works
how it's supposed to...

227
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.873
it'll change our lives.

228
00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:55.914
All right. let's see this here.

229
00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.334
What?

230
00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.839
Of course. dead battery.

231
00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:11.096
- Ben?
- Gabbie?

232
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.141
- You made it!
- Nice to meet you. Sorry I'm late.

233
00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:17.269
Some fog had come up near the house
and it was weird. but...

234
00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:19.855
- Yeah. about that...
- It's fine.

235
00:16:20.564 --> 00:16:21.607
Wait!

236
00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:24.526
I should warn you
before you step inside the house.

237
00:16:26.195 --> 00:16:28.071
This is bad. this is bad.

238
00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.448
As much as I need you...

239
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:31.825
you can leave.

240
00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.243
- No. no. no.
- Yeah. you should leave.

241
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.120
- If you wanna leave. you can leave.
- It's fine. Gabbie.

242
00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:36.830
I'm not afraid of a couple ghosts.

243
00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:38.624
You say that now.

244
00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:40.334
But really...

245
00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:42.586
this could change
the course of your entire life.

246
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.130
Once you come inside. that's it.

247
00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:47.508
There is no going back.

248
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.885
I guess it's just a risk I'm willing to take.

249
00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.011
Now. about the money...

250
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:53.555
Perfect.

251
00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:54.973
All right.

252
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.016
Damn!

253
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.144
- Yes.
- You did not have to give me this much money.

254
00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:02.022
- I don't even know if I can take this.
- No. take it. I insist.

255
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.398
Okay. I'm taking it.

256
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.276
So. why don't you tell me
some more about this house?

257
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.444
It's probably best I show you.

258
00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:10.196
- Yeah. yeah. let's do it.
- Yeah.

259
00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:11.365
Okay.

260
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:18.789
Who are they?

261
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.750
Unclear. I've asked around.

262
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:25.462
There are a lot of colorful theories
about this place.

263
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.507
Okay. well. that's my son.

264
00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:32.636
We sleep in here.
For some reason. it's just safer here.

265
00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.097
And it's just the two of you?

266
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:38.016
Yeah. well. his father...

267
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:39.893
Hey. pumpkin!

268
00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:41.937
Hey. buddy.

269
00:17:42.104 --> 00:17:44.565
Do you wanna come out and meet Mr. Matthias?

270
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:47.484
What's this you got?

271
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.152
Line of defense.

272
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.697
In your line of defense. do you have...

273
00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.490
Action Guy?

274
00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.910
Who's Action Guy?

275
00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.662
You know Action Guy. right?

276
00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:00.038
The one with the shoe?

277
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.039
You remember him?

278
00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.332
- As a weapon?
- Yes.

279
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.168
He uses the shoe as a weapon.

280
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.588
And he would say. he had a punch line.
he said something. it was...

281
00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:10.340
"Say it again! Say it again. boy!"

282
00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:11.466
You don't remember that?

283
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.051
It's like <i>Abuelita</i> with the chancla!

284
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:17.389
Maybe it was just at my discount store.

285
00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:18.515
But what about you?

286
00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.392
I was a doctor in New York...

287
00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.810
and my mother's from here.

288
00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:23.937
And we just wanted to make a fresh start.

289
00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.606
I always wanted to come back...

290
00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.691
and open a bed and breakfast.

291
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.945
Wow. that's an unfortunate
involuntary reaction.

292
00:18:32.196 --> 00:18:33.572
Do you not like bed and breakfasts?

293
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:34.948
They're fine. It's just...

294
00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:38.452
honestly I look at it like
a bunch of strangers getting together...

295
00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.412
talking to each other. pleasantries.

296
00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:42.539
"How you doin'."
blah. blah. blah. you know...

297
00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:46.335
and really. if I'm being honest.
it totally is my worst nightmare.

298
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.671
Well. that's helpful.
Thank you.

299
00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:54.259
We just. you know.
don't have a lot of family.

300
00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.969
Well. I found this place on Zillow.

301
00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.222
I thought that this would be
a great way...

302
00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:01.266
for my son to meet
new and interesting people.

303
00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:02.518
He has trouble making friends.

304
00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.102
Me. too.

305
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.272
And then things got really...

306
00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.316
- bad.
- Terrible.

307
00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:10.609
Yeah.

308
00:19:10.776 --> 00:19:14.154
Anyway. Father Kent mentioned
that you have this special camera lens.

309
00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:15.656
Correct.

310
00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.783
Okay. I think we'll start in this room.

311
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.535
Wait. don't use the flash!

312
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.412
And...

313
00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:23.664
why?

314
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.166
They do not like that.

315
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.212
Maybe we start in the dining room
with the photos.

316
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.217
I just...

317
00:19:37.386 --> 00:19:38.512
moved these back.

318
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.100
It's in here now.

319
00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.061
Y'all playin' tricks on me. huh?

320
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.938
No. you guys think this is funny. huh?

321
00:19:49.273 --> 00:19:50.732
Playing jokes on me.

322
00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.443
I'll check in here for some ghosts.

323
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.945
- No. don't...
- Don't touch him.

324
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:56.321
Don't touch him.

325
00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:57.489
Nothin'.

326
00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.408
- Maybe take a photo?
- Photo?

327
00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:00.576
Right.

328
00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:02.870
That's what I'm here for.

329
00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.420
It's not doing it now...

330
00:20:11.587 --> 00:20:14.298
but normally it will turn its head
and follow you.

331
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.092
- It's absolutely terrifying.
- It is.

332
00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:19.386
I mean. I'm frazzled.

333
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:24.600
And... the basement.

334
00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:30.689
Sometimes. I'll get a sharp pain...

335
00:20:30.856 --> 00:20:34.443
on both of my sides
when I walk this way.

336
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:37.988
So. gonna do it.

337
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:41.450
Okay.

338
00:20:43.202 --> 00:20:44.203
Okay.

339
00:20:45.454 --> 00:20:46.747
All right.

340
00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:50.209
Hey. if you wanna just go back downstairs
and wait for us in your tent. that's okay.

341
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.293
- Okay. honey?
- No.

342
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.128
I wanna do this.

343
00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:54.796
Okay. I got you. Mommy's got you.

344
00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.257
You can do this.

345
00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:58.967
My brave boy.

346
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:07.100
Okay! Okay. I'm here. I'm here.

347
00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.727
You're okay. you're okay.

348
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:10.771
Oh. Baby.

349
00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:15.025
Why don't you just mosey
on over if it's so easy?

350
00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:17.694
- All you have to do...
- You're okay. look at me.

351
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.530
...is one foot in front of the other.

352
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:24.993
It's really only after midnight.

353
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:26.662
Right.

354
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:28.664
Is this guy serious?

355
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.123
Clearly not.

356
00:21:42.678 --> 00:21:44.680
Okay? My big boy.

357
00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:50.227
Okay. I'm just doing some
final calculations here.

358
00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:51.228
Good news.

359
00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:53.063
No ghost.

360
00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:55.732
I know it can be scary.

361
00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:56.900
A big house like this...

362
00:21:57.067 --> 00:22:00.028
creaks in the night. cold drafts.
It happens.

363
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.698
But there's this thing called...

364
00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:04.283
the power of suggestion.

365
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:07.411
Yeah. I probably just need
to calm down. don't I?

366
00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:08.912
Couldn't hurt.

367
00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:41.486
<i>If ghosts exist. what exactly are they?</i>

368
00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:43.780
<i>Back on</i> Deadliest Catch...

369
00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:48.911
<i>The storm finally got done blowing here.
So we're gonna get started.</i>

370
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.081
<i>On the Bairdi grounds.</i>

371
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.212
<i>Get the rest of these pots on
and call it a Bairdi season for 2018.</i>

372
00:22:58.378 --> 00:22:59.505
<i>And be done. don't you agree?</i>

373
00:22:59.671 --> 00:23:00.672
<i>I do agree.</i>

374
00:23:02.341 --> 00:23:03.800
<i>Two days after setting on the...</i>

375
00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:07.763
<i>For the believers. ghosts are
as real as the living. And ghosts that--</i>

376
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.517
<i>Return to what they hope is their
final Bairdi haul.</i>

377
00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:13.268
<i>Let's go. superstar.</i>

378
00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:21.151
<i>As we'll find out. these orbs.
supposedly the energy signatures of ghosts...</i>

379
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.111
<i>may simply mean it's...</i>

380
00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:25.113
<i>...the average. That'll get us home.</i>

381
00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:10.033
What?

382
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.243
But how...

383
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.704
Hey there! It's Ben. right?

384
00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:19.459
Oh. no. no. no.
Nope. Nope. No. Nope. Nope.

385
00:24:23.172 --> 00:24:25.632
Okay. Let's try it now without the flash.

386
00:24:43.984 --> 00:24:45.527
Power of suggestion.

387
00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:35.827
Bad dream. Ben.

388
00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:37.829
That's all it was.
Just a bad dream.

389
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:42.626
What is happening?

390
00:25:44.962 --> 00:25:45.963
What?

391
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.674
What. are you following me?

392
00:25:54.721 --> 00:25:57.432
Okay. Everything's gonna be fine.

393
00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:11.405
No. no. no!

394
00:26:19.288 --> 00:26:20.998
Return!

395
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:44.938
Right on time.

396
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.447
Something followed me home!

397
00:26:53.614 --> 00:26:54.990
Come on. sweetie.
let's get this man some sheets.

398
00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:56.241
Hey!

399
00:26:56.742 --> 00:26:57.910
Hold up. wait!

400
00:26:58.911 --> 00:26:59.745
Don't.

401
00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:02.164
Hey. I said...

402
00:27:02.331 --> 00:27:03.290
something...

403
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:06.168
followed me home!

404
00:27:06.335 --> 00:27:08.837
When I first caught wind...

405
00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:10.714
of what was going down here...

406
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.341
we were out.

407
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:16.428
I mean. do you think I'm going
to keep my son in a haunted house?

408
00:27:16.595 --> 00:27:18.138
- No. you're not gonna...
- No. exactly.

409
00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:20.265
But it didn't matter where we went.

410
00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:22.893
These ghosts. and I...

411
00:27:24.186 --> 00:27:26.396
suspect there might be quite a few...

412
00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:28.190
They're like...

413
00:27:30.526 --> 00:27:31.527
bed bugs.

414
00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:33.654
If you step one foot in here.
they just latch on.

415
00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:37.157
We tried leaving the city.
moving from hotel to hotel...

416
00:27:37.324 --> 00:27:39.535
but the hauntings just kept getting
worse and worse.

417
00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:41.954
They forced us to come back here.
much like you.

418
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.164
So. what you could've done
is spoken to me like an adult...

419
00:27:44.331 --> 00:27:45.791
and told me that I could never go home again.

420
00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:46.792
No. no. no.

421
00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:48.627
You walked through that door.
I warned you.

422
00:27:48.794 --> 00:27:50.629
You could have told me
what was happening before...

423
00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:53.173
Hi. Yeah.

424
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.260
You could have told me
before you let me just walk out of here...

425
00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:57.761
I would feel worse...

426
00:27:57.928 --> 00:28:00.806
if you hadn't taken so much money...

427
00:28:00.973 --> 00:28:03.892
just to use a dead camera
and scribble nonsense.

428
00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:05.769
I did do that.

429
00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:07.396
Scone?

430
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:09.606
Yeah. it's a little late. right?

431
00:28:09.773 --> 00:28:11.275
- They're good.
- They are.

432
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.237
I have a child.

433
00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:18.198
He can't walk anywhere at night...

434
00:28:18.365 --> 00:28:20.284
without a ghost
following him around.

435
00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:25.122
So. I'm sorry. but I will do anything
to protect my son.

436
00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:27.082
I get that...

437
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:29.168
but you don't need me.

438
00:28:30.878 --> 00:28:32.296
You need an exorcist.

439
00:28:33.547 --> 00:28:34.673
We tried that.

440
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:37.384
Same thing happened to me.

441
00:28:38.427 --> 00:28:39.970
Oh. my God.

442
00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:42.222
Ben. welcome.

443
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:43.473
Surprise!

444
00:28:44.183 --> 00:28:46.727
You're in on this as well?
You knew about this the whole time?

445
00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:48.312
You're supposed to be a priest!

446
00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:50.939
What do you want me to say?
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

447
00:28:51.106 --> 00:28:52.482
No. you are a monster!

448
00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:54.735
- Hey. you got paid.
- Not enough.

449
00:28:54.902 --> 00:28:56.987
I asked you. are you ready to be a hero?

450
00:28:57.154 --> 00:28:59.281
And what did I say?
I said. "No."

451
00:28:59.448 --> 00:29:00.949
But your eyes were screaming yes!

452
00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:02.367
Okay. Okay.

453
00:29:02.534 --> 00:29:04.995
You said that he was an expert.

454
00:29:05.162 --> 00:29:06.788
- An expert. I'm not an...
- He is an expert.

455
00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:09.333
He just needs a little encouragement
from Coach Kent.

456
00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:11.126
Now does this thing work or not?

457
00:29:11.293 --> 00:29:13.837
Actually. I took a photo.

458
00:29:19.009 --> 00:29:20.636
'Twas blind but now we see.

459
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:22.513
I wasn't sure at first...

460
00:29:23.096 --> 00:29:26.099
but I think it's that Mariner
from that painting upstairs.

461
00:29:26.683 --> 00:29:27.684
Amazing Grace.

462
00:29:28.644 --> 00:29:29.686
You know what?

463
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:33.065
Guys. now we can use Ben's camera...

464
00:29:33.232 --> 00:29:35.984
and identify every ghost
in this crooked mansion...

465
00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:38.695
see what we're up against.
make it a fair fight.

466
00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:40.364
Why are we talking about fighting ghosts?

467
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:41.698
I mean. we should be figuring out...

468
00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:44.326
how we got trapped here
and how we get our lives back.

469
00:29:44.493 --> 00:29:46.495
Look. we're in a fight
whether we like it or not.

470
00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:49.039
I feel like sometimes you're focusing
a little on the negative.

471
00:29:49.206 --> 00:29:51.458
Yeah. 'cause we're never gonna go home again.

472
00:29:51.625 --> 00:29:52.709
See. that's a downer.

473
00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:55.587
Wait. our ghost kept wanting us to return.

474
00:29:56.463 --> 00:29:57.798
Yeah. Mine. too.

475
00:29:57.965 --> 00:29:58.841
Mine did. too.

476
00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:01.343
She was missing half her face.
so it was hard to understand...

477
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.929
but she just kept saying.
"re-worm. re-worm."

478
00:30:04.096 --> 00:30:05.681
Wait. wait. they didn't wanna haunt us.

479
00:30:07.474 --> 00:30:09.601
They want us back here for some reason.

480
00:30:12.855 --> 00:30:14.356
- It's midnight. Hurry!
- Yeah.

481
00:30:14.606 --> 00:30:15.607
What happened?

482
00:30:15.774 --> 00:30:18.026
After midnight.
we all stay together in this room.

483
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:19.278
It's safer that way.

484
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.655
Father Kent's claimed the blue couch.

485
00:30:21.822 --> 00:30:22.823
Yeah. I mean...

486
00:30:23.615 --> 00:30:24.700
unless you want to sleep there.

487
00:30:24.867 --> 00:30:28.203
It's just I have a bad back
from all the feet that I cleaned in Calcutta.

488
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.288
Take the couch.

489
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.415
Sleep all you want.

490
00:30:31.582 --> 00:30:34.334
If they want us here. I'm gonna find out why.

491
00:30:35.002 --> 00:30:36.378
Hey. where are you going?

492
00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:41.383
You're not supposed to leave after midnight!
You're breaking the rules. stop!

493
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.551
Mom!

494
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.720
These people are...

495
00:30:52.936 --> 00:30:55.480
Hello? Anyone?

496
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.777
Gabbie?

497
00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:01.862
Travis?

498
00:31:06.658 --> 00:31:07.826
Nope.

499
00:31:09.995 --> 00:31:11.079
Nope.

500
00:31:26.553 --> 00:31:28.305
Did I frighten you?

501
00:31:28.764 --> 00:31:30.891
Good. you should be frightened.

502
00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:35.145
He's going to be so excited you're here.
He loves guests.

503
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.191
Ben. are you...

504
00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:43.362
- What?
- Ben. are you okay?

505
00:31:46.073 --> 00:31:47.908
We're gonna need more help.

506
00:31:49.076 --> 00:31:50.827
It's time to assemble the Dream Team.

507
00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:52.621
That's the nickname I'm giving us.

508
00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:54.122
I'm pretty sure that's taken.

509
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:58.919
First thing we need to do is figure out
what happened in this house.

510
00:31:59.086 --> 00:32:01.797
That's why I've contacted
the foremost historian...

511
00:32:01.964 --> 00:32:04.174
on Greek revival manors in this area.

512
00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:05.509
Now. he's dead...

513
00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:08.846
but I quickly pivoted.
'cause that's what the Dream Team does...

514
00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:11.181
<i>and I discovered there's a professor
at Tulane...</i>

515
00:32:11.348 --> 00:32:14.518
<i>who wrote a book on haunted mansions
in Louisiana.</i>

516
00:32:14.685 --> 00:32:16.228
<i>Only sold about nine copies...</i>

517
00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:18.438
<i>but. hey. he's not dead.</i>

518
00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:19.481
Professor?

519
00:32:19.648 --> 00:32:22.317
Look. if you're coming down here
to talk about your grades...

520
00:32:22.484 --> 00:32:24.152
- turn right around and walk on out...
- No.

521
00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:25.362
...because I'm gonna dock ya!

522
00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:29.491
We're actually not students.
I got a question for you. though. sir.

523
00:32:30.075 --> 00:32:32.953
Do you know anything about this place?

524
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.666
Well. science begins with observation.

525
00:32:37.833 --> 00:32:39.918
<i>So. I'll take pictures
of all of these ghosts...</i>

526
00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:42.212
<i>to make sure we know
exactly what we're dealing with.</i>

527
00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:44.506
<i>Great. And once we know
what we're dealing with...</i>

528
00:32:44.673 --> 00:32:46.592
we're gonna need someone
who can talk to these ghosts.

529
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:48.260
A psychic.

530
00:32:48.427 --> 00:32:50.929
<i>I did find one within our price range.</i>

531
00:32:51.305 --> 00:32:53.640
<i>She's been doing readings at Bar Mitzvahs...</i>

532
00:32:53.807 --> 00:32:55.809
but gets a very solid Yelp score.

533
00:32:58.103 --> 00:33:00.063
Make yourselves comfortable.

534
00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.067
Who is Mitchell?

535
00:33:05.194 --> 00:33:06.486
- I don't know.
- Think a little harder.

536
00:33:06.653 --> 00:33:09.823
I meet a lot of people in my parish.
so I guess it's possible that...

537
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.325
He doesn't know anyone named Mitchell.

538
00:33:11.491 --> 00:33:13.243
What about Giovanni?

539
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.537
- No. I don't think so...
- Gary?

540
00:33:15.704 --> 00:33:17.748
Have you recently met someone named Gary?

541
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:20.209
Okay. so now we're just thinking of names
that start with "G"?

542
00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:21.710
Okay. so that's a "no" on Gary?

543
00:33:21.877 --> 00:33:24.588
Actually. she's good.
You're very good.

544
00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:27.716
No. I did know a Cousin Gary
in my neighborhood.

545
00:33:27.883 --> 00:33:30.552
- Thank you so much for today...
- You're lying.

546
00:33:31.178 --> 00:33:32.387
You haven't met a Gary.

547
00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:35.390
Have you met someone named Gabbie?

548
00:33:42.856 --> 00:33:46.026
Baby's got to be home before dark!

549
00:33:46.193 --> 00:33:48.612
Why do you have to get home so soon?

550
00:33:49.321 --> 00:33:51.281
Saw those boys chasing you.

551
00:33:52.366 --> 00:33:53.867
They were just running me home.

552
00:33:55.118 --> 00:33:56.453
I think they just need...

553
00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:59.248
a little bit more time to get to know me.

554
00:33:59.957 --> 00:34:01.750
- Yeah.
- I see that you're busy.

555
00:34:11.217 --> 00:34:14.679
That house has a string of traumatic events.

556
00:34:14.847 --> 00:34:15.889
Explosions.

557
00:34:16.056 --> 00:34:16.974
Quicksand.

558
00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.391
In Louisiana!

559
00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:20.978
That family might want to move.

560
00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:23.647
Now eat up. Happy Hour ends at 6:00!

561
00:34:23.813 --> 00:34:24.982
Okay?

562
00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:26.149
One more time.

563
00:34:27.234 --> 00:34:28.402
One more time. Open.

564
00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:31.362
Are you kidding me?

565
00:34:36.034 --> 00:34:38.245
So much activity during midnight.

566
00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:39.871
See. I tried to get a read on the ghosts...

567
00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:42.791
but it's hard
because they just won't stop moving.

568
00:34:43.542 --> 00:34:45.168
They're not just moving.

569
00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:48.672
I know this feeling.
They're running from something.

570
00:34:50.299 --> 00:34:52.509
Thank you for inviting me. Father Kent.

571
00:34:55.053 --> 00:34:56.513
Who's reimbursing my mileage?

572
00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:02.853
People...

573
00:35:03.729 --> 00:35:04.938
used to...

574
00:35:06.523 --> 00:35:07.357
eat here.

575
00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:10.360
I told you she's good.

576
00:35:10.527 --> 00:35:12.070
No. it's a dining room.

577
00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:14.948
Sometime after 1788...

578
00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:18.785
the mansion was discovered fully built.

579
00:35:18.952 --> 00:35:20.621
No land had ever been worked.

580
00:35:20.913 --> 00:35:22.873
The earliest record I could dig up...

581
00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:24.416
is this deed...

582
00:35:24.917 --> 00:35:27.628
acquired by William Gracey.

583
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.717
<i>He purchased it
from a previously undisclosed owner.</i>

584
00:35:33.884 --> 00:35:37.179
<i>His wife. Eleanor. died of yellow fever.</i>

585
00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:40.807
That's when things started to get weird.

586
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.976
Isn't this great?

587
00:35:43.143 --> 00:35:46.063
I mean. I've been dying to go to this place
for 60 years.

588
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.690
That's why we came to you.
because you've got a vision.

589
00:35:48.857 --> 00:35:49.942
Guys. I gotta see this.

590
00:35:50.108 --> 00:35:51.860
I'm having heart surgery next week.

591
00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:53.195
You...

592
00:35:53.362 --> 00:35:55.239
- You cannot come.
- I need to come.

593
00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:56.448
- No.
- No. I need to come!

594
00:35:56.615 --> 00:35:59.868
- It's not a good idea. It's a long ways away.
- Sixty years I've tried to get in there!

595
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:02.120
I can follow you. I've got a car.

596
00:36:02.287 --> 00:36:03.705
Do not come!

597
00:36:03.872 --> 00:36:05.707
Then I guess you don't need these.

598
00:36:05.874 --> 00:36:07.918
All right. all right.
you do what you're doing...

599
00:36:08.085 --> 00:36:10.003
- I'll go use the restroom and...
- Good. Okay.

600
00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.297
Run. run! Run! Go. run!

601
00:36:12.464 --> 00:36:14.132
- What? Okay. I'll start the car!
- Go!

602
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:16.844
Hey. help. help!

603
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.887
So strong!

604
00:36:22.266 --> 00:36:24.351
Fire. fire. fire.
Fire. fire. fire.

605
00:36:24.518 --> 00:36:27.729
If there's an evil spirit here.
only a banishment will do.

606
00:36:27.896 --> 00:36:30.649
And let me tell you. it will fight back.

607
00:36:30.816 --> 00:36:31.859
Ghosts like to fight.

608
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:34.278
For example. 1813...

609
00:36:34.736 --> 00:36:37.906
a group of mediums went into the house
just a little north of here.

610
00:36:38.073 --> 00:36:39.950
It took 21 days.

611
00:36:40.158 --> 00:36:44.621
They worked their butts off and they got
that deceased owner out of there.

612
00:36:45.038 --> 00:36:46.957
But. they were all found...

613
00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:48.959
How old are you?

614
00:36:49.626 --> 00:36:50.419
Nine.

615
00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:53.839
Okay. I'm talkin' organs on the outside.

616
00:36:54.006 --> 00:36:55.507
- Oh. Come on.
- Nine is young!

617
00:36:55.674 --> 00:36:57.634
It's not that young. girl.
I was drivin' by nine.

618
00:36:57.801 --> 00:37:00.179
Look. I know that might have been
an extreme example.

619
00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:03.056
- Yes!
- But they were a group of amateurs.

620
00:37:03.223 --> 00:37:05.893
I am a professional. Okay?

621
00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:10.814
I'm bona fide and qualified. certified.
and I can get rid of what died.

622
00:37:11.106 --> 00:37:12.149
Well. I don't doubt it.

623
00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:14.860
I've sensed a lot of grief in this house.

624
00:37:15.027 --> 00:37:18.238
And grief. unprocessed.
will make a spirit stuck.

625
00:37:18.405 --> 00:37:20.407
Okay. can you help us unstick them then?

626
00:37:20.574 --> 00:37:21.575
I can do it.

627
00:37:21.742 --> 00:37:23.243
But I would need a week. paid...

628
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.538
where I can recharge my crystals
and begin doing my research.

629
00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:28.248
And then. we can get to it.

630
00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:31.043
I'll send you a invoice from PayPal
in the meantime.

631
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.461
Bye-bye.

632
00:37:34.588 --> 00:37:36.423
Nice meeting you!

633
00:37:38.926 --> 00:37:42.012
<i>You didn't tell me
that these ghosts be following people!</i>

634
00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:44.806
I know your mama
gots to be disappointed in you.

635
00:37:44.973 --> 00:37:46.642
I know she disappointed in you...

636
00:37:46.808 --> 00:37:49.019
'cause I'm pretty sure
she taught you better than this!

637
00:37:49.186 --> 00:37:50.312
I knew this was weird.

638
00:37:50.479 --> 00:37:53.732
All these freaky. different-looking people
living in the same place.

639
00:37:54.316 --> 00:37:55.317
How's she doing?

640
00:37:55.484 --> 00:37:56.568
She's pissed.

641
00:37:57.194 --> 00:37:59.404
What you have done...

642
00:37:59.571 --> 00:38:02.658
is deeply wrong and absolutely unforgivable.

643
00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:06.036
The ghost that followed me home
was on a horse.

644
00:38:06.203 --> 00:38:08.413
Do you have any idea what it's like...

645
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.917
to have a ghost horse...

646
00:38:12.084 --> 00:38:13.669
charging through your bedroom?

647
00:38:13.836 --> 00:38:16.797
Now I've decided to be the bigger person
and help you.

648
00:38:16.964 --> 00:38:19.716
Mostly because you have left me
no other options.

649
00:38:20.634 --> 00:38:21.635
So. tell me...

650
00:38:22.261 --> 00:38:23.971
what happened in this house?

651
00:38:26.974 --> 00:38:29.101
Wow. these are beautiful.

652
00:38:29.268 --> 00:38:30.477
These blueprints that you...

653
00:38:31.728 --> 00:38:32.980
borrowed...

654
00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:34.273
- are incredible.
- Come on.

655
00:38:34.439 --> 00:38:37.609
Am I proud of the fact that Ben attacked
an elderly educator?

656
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.987
Of course not.
That being said...

657
00:38:40.404 --> 00:38:41.780
totally worth it.

658
00:38:41.947 --> 00:38:44.408
These papers say what happened in this house.

659
00:38:44.575 --> 00:38:47.661
Widower Gracey lost his mind
and took his own life.

660
00:38:47.828 --> 00:38:49.997
Suffering from grief.
Didn't I say I sensed grief?

661
00:38:50.163 --> 00:38:52.958
And apparently. he spent all his money
on some psychic or something.

662
00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:55.377
"Medium." We're called mediums.

663
00:38:55.544 --> 00:38:56.587
A medium.

664
00:38:56.753 --> 00:38:57.588
Thank you.

665
00:38:57.754 --> 00:39:00.632
I guess. subsequently after that.
66 people moved into this house...

666
00:39:00.799 --> 00:39:03.719
and each one of them
died a spectacularly terrible...

667
00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:05.304
oddly specific death.

668
00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:08.765
<i>Two brothers shot each other in a duel.</i>

669
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:12.603
<i>And this wife chopped up
five of her husbands.</i>

670
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.023
So. Gracey must be the key to stopping this.

671
00:39:16.607 --> 00:39:17.900
What was the medium's name?

672
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.235
Madame Leoto. I think.

673
00:39:20.402 --> 00:39:21.987
Madame Leota?

674
00:39:22.154 --> 00:39:25.199
Madame Leota was the greatest medium ever.

675
00:39:25.365 --> 00:39:26.950
Sought after by the royals...

676
00:39:27.242 --> 00:39:28.410
and rich people.

677
00:39:28.577 --> 00:39:29.578
Wait. wait. wait. what's this?

678
00:39:29.745 --> 00:39:33.415
This is a letter from William Gracey
to Madame Leota...

679
00:39:33.582 --> 00:39:36.168
asking her to come to his seance room.

680
00:39:36.335 --> 00:39:37.628
But we don't have a seance room.

681
00:39:37.794 --> 00:39:38.670
You sure?

682
00:39:38.837 --> 00:39:39.838
Wait.

683
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:44.218
There isn't a room
at the end of that hallway.

684
00:39:48.722 --> 00:39:49.723
See?

685
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:51.350
Nothing here.

686
00:39:51.517 --> 00:39:53.268
- It's just...
- Wait! Hold it.

687
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:55.354
I got it.

688
00:40:08.158 --> 00:40:09.117
Wow. you just...

689
00:40:09.284 --> 00:40:10.827
- Okay. that...
- Yeah.

690
00:40:11.245 --> 00:40:12.871
Wait. wait. wait. Hold on.

691
00:40:13.664 --> 00:40:15.165
Wait. what? Okay.

692
00:40:44.653 --> 00:40:45.863
Be careful. there's a step.

693
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.866
Smells mildewy.

694
00:40:57.833 --> 00:40:58.834
What's that?

695
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:03.130
Oil.

696
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:07.467
Wait. I think I know what this is.
One second here.

697
00:41:15.642 --> 00:41:16.560
Okay.

698
00:41:25.777 --> 00:41:28.113
Oh. my God.

699
00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:31.867
This hasn't been touched in centuries.

700
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:35.787
Maybe I'll just do a little blessing.

701
00:41:35.954 --> 00:41:38.540
A prayer to get us started on the right foot.

702
00:41:39.416 --> 00:41:41.126
God. give us a break.

703
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.004
We don't want to be haunted...

704
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:47.090
and it just seems like
there's so many bad people in the world.

705
00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:48.091
Haunt them.

706
00:41:48.258 --> 00:41:51.845
How about an "Amen" at the count of three?
One. two. three. amen!

707
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:53.055
Amen.

708
00:41:53.222 --> 00:41:54.389
Are you sure he's a priest?

709
00:41:55.182 --> 00:41:58.227
Now. if I can communicate
with William Gracey...

710
00:41:58.393 --> 00:42:02.189
I suspect he will have the answers
that we need.

711
00:42:02.356 --> 00:42:03.524
And just to confirm...

712
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:08.529
the only thing available to us
is this French Vanilla Yankee Candle?

713
00:42:08.695 --> 00:42:10.280
Yeah. I keep forgetting...

714
00:42:11.281 --> 00:42:13.116
to cancel my subscription to Amazon
so it just...

715
00:42:13.283 --> 00:42:15.118
Please. hold hands.

716
00:42:19.957 --> 00:42:21.667
Now. I will quiet my mind...

717
00:42:21.834 --> 00:42:24.503
so that I can communicate
with the other side.

718
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.547
Please do not interrupt me.

719
00:42:26.713 --> 00:42:28.298
Otherwise I have to start all over again.

720
00:42:28.465 --> 00:42:29.675
Of course.

721
00:42:54.658 --> 00:42:57.452
- She asleep. Look. She asleep.
- No. She's in a...

722
00:42:57.619 --> 00:42:59.288
Hey. she's in a trance.

723
00:42:59.454 --> 00:43:00.622
It's a...

724
00:43:01.707 --> 00:43:03.500
- Wait. is she asleep?
- She's asleep.

725
00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:05.669
- Is she sleeping? Or is it just a trance?
- I'm looking right at her. She's asleep.

726
00:43:05.836 --> 00:43:07.129
Can I do this?

727
00:43:07.754 --> 00:43:09.464
- Okay.
- Now you got me all mad!

728
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:10.465
We're sorry.

729
00:43:11.216 --> 00:43:12.718
Please do get peaceful again.

730
00:43:24.605 --> 00:43:25.772
Okay. it...

731
00:43:27.065 --> 00:43:28.108
- Why...
- Maybe she's narcoleptic?

732
00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:29.109
I don't...

733
00:43:30.402 --> 00:43:31.737
Who goes there?

734
00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:33.030
Spirits...

735
00:43:34.114 --> 00:43:36.325
I come here with good intent.

736
00:43:36.491 --> 00:43:40.162
I summon the spirit of William Gracey.

737
00:43:40.329 --> 00:43:42.080
If you are here with us...

738
00:43:42.247 --> 00:43:45.167
give us a sign!

739
00:43:56.261 --> 00:43:57.513
He's with us.

740
00:43:58.555 --> 00:43:59.848
Why are you here?

741
00:44:00.641 --> 00:44:02.100
Why are you hanging on?

742
00:44:02.851 --> 00:44:06.021
If you have a message
that you'd like to leave us...

743
00:44:06.188 --> 00:44:07.689
or a greeting of sorts...

744
00:44:07.856 --> 00:44:09.650
here's a pen and pad...

745
00:44:09.816 --> 00:44:12.236
that I purchased from CVS.

746
00:44:30.754 --> 00:44:32.881
Ben. camera!

747
00:44:33.048 --> 00:44:34.800
Go. go. go!
Come on. come on. come on!

748
00:44:43.183 --> 00:44:45.018
Wow! It's Gracey!

749
00:44:53.026 --> 00:44:54.027
He's gone.

750
00:44:54.528 --> 00:44:55.654
What does it say?

751
00:44:55.821 --> 00:44:57.781
{\an8}"Talk to Leota."

752
00:45:02.703 --> 00:45:05.080
You really can speak to the dead.

753
00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:08.667
Of course.

754
00:45:10.377 --> 00:45:12.379
Can you contact someone for me?

755
00:45:12.963 --> 00:45:13.881
Who?

756
00:45:22.055 --> 00:45:23.098
My wife.

757
00:45:25.893 --> 00:45:28.187
You were the grieving spirit.

758
00:45:34.193 --> 00:45:35.569
Her name's Alyssa.

759
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:38.238
Yes.

760
00:45:41.074 --> 00:45:42.326
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

761
00:45:42.492 --> 00:45:44.161
I can't.

762
00:45:44.328 --> 00:45:46.121
I don't think she's here.

763
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.167
Could you see if Leota's here?

764
00:46:00.844 --> 00:46:02.262
This feels different.

765
00:46:03.388 --> 00:46:04.973
What does this feel like?

766
00:46:05.807 --> 00:46:06.934
Madness.

767
00:46:14.274 --> 00:46:16.026
Harriet. summon Leota!

768
00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:18.529
I summon Madame Leota!

769
00:46:18.695 --> 00:46:19.821
No!

770
00:46:26.495 --> 00:46:27.579
Come on! Oh. my goodness!

771
00:46:28.705 --> 00:46:30.165
- Help me!
- Harriet!

772
00:46:30.332 --> 00:46:31.959
Okay. okay. wait.

773
00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:34.253
No. Wait. wait. wait!

774
00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:39.967
I wanted to get out of here.
but not like this!

775
00:46:40.133 --> 00:46:41.426
- Harriet!
- Harriet. Come on!

776
00:46:44.805 --> 00:46:45.722
Harriet!

777
00:46:46.598 --> 00:46:47.683
Harriet. come on.

778
00:46:49.059 --> 00:46:50.602
We made it mad!

779
00:46:50.894 --> 00:46:52.980
I did not know it was gonna be a spa day.

780
00:46:53.146 --> 00:46:54.731
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

781
00:46:58.318 --> 00:46:59.194
Is that Bruce?

782
00:46:59.361 --> 00:47:01.280
- Hey! Wait!
- Stop! No!

783
00:47:01.446 --> 00:47:03.115
- Who is this?
- Bruce!

784
00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:06.159
Do not go in. Bruce! Don't go in!

785
00:47:08.412 --> 00:47:10.747
You steal my stuff. leave me flat!

786
00:47:10.914 --> 00:47:12.207
I'll show you!

787
00:47:12.374 --> 00:47:15.502
I will see this house.
and nothing's gonna stop me.

788
00:47:22.676 --> 00:47:23.677
Bruce!

789
00:47:24.636 --> 00:47:25.929
- Help!
- Bruce!

790
00:47:28.098 --> 00:47:29.516
Grandma. you know. Grandma.

791
00:47:32.686 --> 00:47:35.981
I'm too old to die!
It's not...

792
00:47:43.655 --> 00:47:45.449
I'm curious why a man his age...

793
00:47:45.616 --> 00:47:48.160
- was riding a chair down a main road?
- A chair...

794
00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:52.623
- He loves to do that.
- He likes to ride chairs.

795
00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:54.249
- Yeah. it's kind of his thing.
- It's his thing.

796
00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:55.667
I don't like the chair!

797
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:57.878
Okay. well. let's put a pin in that.

798
00:47:58.045 --> 00:47:59.963
- Make sure he gets lots of rest.
- Rest. Okay.

799
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.632
- Okay?
- Yeah.

800
00:48:01.798 --> 00:48:05.219
And no more excitement.
or next time it might not be a false alarm.

801
00:48:05.385 --> 00:48:08.388
Now. he said that he does live alone.
so I'd like to keep him overnight.

802
00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:11.099
Yeah. maybe get some fluids.

803
00:48:12.935 --> 00:48:14.269
- No. look. look.
- No?

804
00:48:14.436 --> 00:48:15.312
- No. No!
- No.

805
00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:17.022
Oh. my goodness!

806
00:48:17.189 --> 00:48:18.607
- We should go. We should really go.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

807
00:48:18.774 --> 00:48:20.984
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
- We're not going to leave you.

808
00:48:21.151 --> 00:48:22.444
Relax. relax.

809
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:24.446
We should all go home now.

810
00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:28.325
First he's trapping us here.
now he's dragging us out.

811
00:48:28.492 --> 00:48:30.202
Enough! Make up your mind.

812
00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:31.787
Well. this isn't Gracey.

813
00:48:31.954 --> 00:48:34.957
Whatever evil this is.
doesn't want us to talk to Leota.

814
00:48:35.457 --> 00:48:37.251
It sees us as a threat now.

815
00:48:37.584 --> 00:48:40.254
Let's just go find Leota
and see what she has to say.

816
00:48:40.462 --> 00:48:42.756
Is there anyone that we need to contact
to let them know that you're here...

817
00:48:42.923 --> 00:48:44.049
so they don't worry?

818
00:48:44.216 --> 00:48:45.634
Well. there is a woman.

819
00:48:45.926 --> 00:48:48.053
I make her take my trash down for me.

820
00:48:48.637 --> 00:48:50.806
- She's...
- Yeah. I bet she'll be okay.

821
00:48:50.973 --> 00:48:51.765
- Yes.
- Yeah.

822
00:48:51.932 --> 00:48:52.850
Go on. I don't wanna play now.

823
00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:54.852
- I need to check your pulse. Let me...
- Hey. my love. boundaries.

824
00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:56.186
Go on. go on. Get out of here.

825
00:48:56.353 --> 00:48:57.813
Boundaries.

826
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.858
I'm sorry to hear about your wife passing.

827
00:49:02.276 --> 00:49:03.485
It's good that she's not here.

828
00:49:04.152 --> 00:49:07.072
The living and the dead belong
in different places.

829
00:49:08.282 --> 00:49:09.116
See...

830
00:49:10.742 --> 00:49:12.953
this is our world...

831
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.497
and this is the Region Beyond.

832
00:49:16.582 --> 00:49:18.458
And the place where they overlap most...

833
00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:22.045
is where the living can encounter the dead
through hauntings.

834
00:49:22.379 --> 00:49:23.839
Like this house.

835
00:49:24.339 --> 00:49:28.260
But. when a soul passes
and goes over into the Region Beyond...

836
00:49:28.427 --> 00:49:31.513
if it's at peace. that's where it stays.

837
00:49:32.222 --> 00:49:33.932
It's good that she's not here.

838
00:49:34.808 --> 00:49:36.226
She's at peace.

839
00:49:36.727 --> 00:49:38.896
And I bet she wants you to be too.

840
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:40.898
I know this might sound silly...

841
00:49:41.899 --> 00:49:46.486
but I believe that souls can send signs
from the Region Beyond.

842
00:49:46.653 --> 00:49:51.116
My father passed away.
and he loved model trains.

843
00:49:52.367 --> 00:49:54.119
He would take them apart...

844
00:49:54.286 --> 00:49:56.538
and put them back together again every day.

845
00:49:57.748 --> 00:50:00.584
But on those days when I get really low...

846
00:50:02.419 --> 00:50:03.921
I mean really low...

847
00:50:05.756 --> 00:50:07.758
I will randomly hear...

848
00:50:07.925 --> 00:50:11.136
a train off in the distance.

849
00:50:13.096 --> 00:50:15.599
And I know that's my dad saying "Hi."

850
00:50:19.228 --> 00:50:20.437
Those moments...

851
00:50:21.313 --> 00:50:22.981
are called ghost winks.

852
00:51:14.658 --> 00:51:16.159
Ben.

853
00:51:17.202 --> 00:51:19.496
Sorry to be so familiar.

854
00:51:20.122 --> 00:51:22.916
I just feel I know you already.

855
00:51:23.709 --> 00:51:26.837
You see. we have a friend in common.

856
00:51:28.088 --> 00:51:29.173
Alyssa?

857
00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:33.969
Alyssa!

858
00:51:37.055 --> 00:51:38.056
Alyssa?

859
00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:41.643
I wouldn't go in there...

860
00:51:44.396 --> 00:51:48.233
unless you want a ticket
to the Region Beyond!

861
00:51:50.944 --> 00:51:52.321
Take us with you?

862
00:51:52.487 --> 00:51:54.907
We know you're heading that way soon!

863
00:51:56.033 --> 00:51:57.075
Alyssa!

864
00:52:11.423 --> 00:52:12.466
Alyssa.

865
00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:18.347
- Ben!
- What. what. what?

866
00:52:18.514 --> 00:52:21.225
Bruce disappeared
and something's happening.

867
00:52:29.066 --> 00:52:30.859
All right. I'm going after him.

868
00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:32.319
All right. here. give me these.

869
00:52:32.486 --> 00:52:33.904
- No. it's after midnight!
- No!

870
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:35.822
- I got you covered.
- Harriet!

871
00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:37.616
I'm gonna cover us with some morning prayers.

872
00:52:37.783 --> 00:52:39.076
It's the middle of the night!

873
00:52:39.243 --> 00:52:40.494
Not in Rome.

874
00:52:51.421 --> 00:52:52.422
Do you see anything?

875
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:54.049
No. but I feel something.

876
00:52:55.676 --> 00:52:57.886
Bruce. don't...
What are you doing out here?

877
00:52:58.053 --> 00:52:59.763
We got to find Leota.

878
00:53:00.305 --> 00:53:01.515
What about the attic?

879
00:53:03.016 --> 00:53:06.436
I don't know about this.
Attics are historically terrifying.

880
00:53:06.603 --> 00:53:08.814
Is it cold? It's starting to feel colder.

881
00:53:08.981 --> 00:53:10.732
Well. you don't have any pants on. Bruce.

882
00:53:10.899 --> 00:53:12.234
Can't you guys both just...

883
00:53:15.445 --> 00:53:16.572
Dang.

884
00:53:18.532 --> 00:53:19.408
All right.

885
00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:28.584
- Go on up!
- Bruce. wait!

886
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.879
- Bruce. I need you to protect me!
- Let go! What?

887
00:53:32.045 --> 00:53:33.338
- Bruce. stay here and protect me!
- You have a heart condition. Come on.

888
00:53:33.505 --> 00:53:35.132
All right. all right. all right.

889
00:53:35.716 --> 00:53:36.592
Protect me.

890
00:53:38.844 --> 00:53:39.845
All right.

891
00:53:43.515 --> 00:53:45.058
Be safe up there.

892
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:50.981
Hello?

893
00:53:57.946 --> 00:53:59.406
Madame Leota?

894
00:54:06.163 --> 00:54:07.581
We need your help.

895
00:54:08.415 --> 00:54:10.959
Whoa! Hey. hey. hey!

896
00:54:13.295 --> 00:54:14.796
Did you do that?

897
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:16.507
No. I did not!

898
00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:35.150
Leota? Is that you?

899
00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:02.427
Closer.

900
00:55:04.179 --> 00:55:05.514
Closer.

901
00:55:17.234 --> 00:55:18.235
Oh. okay.

902
00:55:18.652 --> 00:55:19.778
I want out of here!

903
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.366
Holy!

904
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:32.040
Hey. hey. hey.

905
00:55:32.207 --> 00:55:35.252
Hey. listen. I'm sure those guys deserved
what they got...

906
00:55:35.419 --> 00:55:36.879
but. baby. baby. listen...

907
00:55:37.045 --> 00:55:38.422
I know you can hear me. okay. babe?

908
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:40.048
Ghost Bae.
Can I call you Ghost Bae?

909
00:55:40.215 --> 00:55:41.800
But me. I'm different. I'm a supporter.

910
00:55:41.967 --> 00:55:44.553
I'm an ally. to you. and to all women...

911
00:56:03.071 --> 00:56:04.907
- It's a little musty.
- Acrid.

912
00:56:05.073 --> 00:56:06.283
- Wow.
- It stinks.

913
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.826
Contaminated.

914
00:56:12.581 --> 00:56:14.374
All right. So. it says...

915
00:56:14.833 --> 00:56:17.836
Here.
"Property of Madame Leota.

916
00:56:18.795 --> 00:56:20.214
"If this does not belong to you...

917
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.633
"Do not turn...

918
00:56:23.258 --> 00:56:24.676
"another page."

919
00:56:25.093 --> 00:56:27.971
- Oh. my God! Oh. my God!
- Hey. Harriet!

920
00:56:28.138 --> 00:56:31.808
This is Madame Leota's
personal book of incantations!

921
00:56:31.975 --> 00:56:32.976
Oh. my God!

922
00:56:33.143 --> 00:56:34.311
I mean. one of us had to do it.

923
00:56:34.686 --> 00:56:37.022
Dreams do come true. Oh. my goodness!

924
00:56:37.689 --> 00:56:39.024
Damn. what is that?

925
00:56:39.483 --> 00:56:40.692
That's nice.

926
00:56:40.984 --> 00:56:42.236
A crystal ball.

927
00:56:42.694 --> 00:56:44.530
Is this worth anything?

928
00:56:46.573 --> 00:56:47.574
Hey!

929
00:56:48.325 --> 00:56:50.452
Ma'am. we can see you. Hi.

930
00:56:56.959 --> 00:56:57.918
Madame Leota?

931
00:56:58.085 --> 00:57:00.170
Well. it's about time.

932
00:57:00.754 --> 00:57:03.507
Very powerful book you're holding.

933
00:57:03.674 --> 00:57:06.093
Best know how to use it.

934
00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.344
How did you get in there?

935
00:57:07.761 --> 00:57:11.348
I can show you what happened.
but it will cost you...

936
00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:15.060
Three dollars.

937
00:57:15.978 --> 00:57:16.979
- What?
- Wow.

938
00:57:17.145 --> 00:57:19.940
- That's highway robbery!
- That's fine. that's fine. Go ahead.

939
00:57:25.779 --> 00:57:28.907
<i>William Gracey. lost in grief...</i>

940
00:57:29.074 --> 00:57:33.036
<i>sought me out to contact his deceased wife.</i>

941
00:57:35.163 --> 00:57:36.957
Eleanor Gracey!

942
00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:42.171
Rap on a table. it's time to respond.

943
00:57:42.337 --> 00:57:47.217
- Open a bridge to the Region Beyond!
<i>- When she didn't come back to him...</i>

944
00:57:47.384 --> 00:57:50.095
<i>we called for her again and again.</i>

945
00:57:50.262 --> 00:57:53.056
<i>A seance every midnight. for a year.</i>

946
00:57:53.223 --> 00:57:54.933
For a year? That's so reckless.

947
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.059
Who said that?

948
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:06.195
<i>The repeated seances opened the floodgates
of the ghost realm.</i>

949
00:58:06.361 --> 00:58:09.823
<i>Hundreds of spirits freely came and went...</i>

950
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:12.034
<i>but never his beloved Eleanor.</i>

951
00:58:12.367 --> 00:58:17.372
<i>I begged him to stop. for fear
of what we might accidentally call forth.</i>

952
00:58:17.539 --> 00:58:19.541
<i>But he insisted we keep going.</i>

953
00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:24.546
<i>Soon. Gracey was receiving messages
from Eleanor...</i>

954
00:58:24.713 --> 00:58:27.883
<i>imploring him to join her on the other side.</i>

955
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.553
<i>But I knew this wasn't Eleanor.</i>

956
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:35.557
<i>We had summoned a terrible evil...</i>

957
00:58:35.724 --> 00:58:38.477
<i>who fed on Gracey's grief.</i>

958
00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:44.358
<i>This was no ordinary ghost.</i>

959
00:58:44.525 --> 00:58:46.276
<i>He had the power to...</i>

960
00:58:46.443 --> 00:58:51.698
<i>...trap these once happy souls in this house.</i>

961
00:59:00.082 --> 00:59:01.083
Mine!

962
00:59:02.042 --> 00:59:04.086
<i>Before I could get a look at him...</i>

963
00:59:04.253 --> 00:59:07.923
his dark spirit trapped me
in my own crystal ball.

964
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:10.467
Who knows how long.

965
00:59:11.385 --> 00:59:13.053
Probably months now.

966
00:59:15.222 --> 00:59:19.351
He has trapped 933 souls.

967
00:59:19.726 --> 00:59:23.063
But he needs 1.000 to complete the ritual...

968
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:25.607
that will let him escape this house.

969
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.487
Beware the full moon.
when he is most powerful.

970
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:32.906
You won't survive it.

971
00:59:34.366 --> 00:59:36.326
Oh. there's much grief in you.

972
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.124
You will be most vulnerable
to his manipulations.

973
00:59:43.792 --> 00:59:46.086
Not on our watch. We got you.

974
00:59:46.253 --> 00:59:47.462
But what are you gonna do?

975
00:59:49.464 --> 00:59:51.466
- Yeah.
- They're already dead!

976
00:59:51.633 --> 00:59:52.801
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be deader.

977
00:59:52.968 --> 00:59:53.802
Okay.

978
00:59:53.969 --> 00:59:55.929
You know what we need?
We need a banishment.

979
00:59:56.096 --> 00:59:56.972
- Yeah.
- A banishment!

980
00:59:57.139 --> 00:59:58.807
Yes. a banishment...

981
00:59:58.974 --> 01:00:03.979
but it requires an object
the spirit once possessed.

982
01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:05.355
Once you have that...

983
01:00:05.522 --> 01:00:06.690
Enough!

984
01:00:14.198 --> 01:00:16.450
We're okay. Let's find a banishing.
Okay. so...

985
01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:18.535
I hate to be the bearer of bad news...

986
01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:22.372
but there's been 66 deaths in this house...

987
01:00:22.539 --> 01:00:24.917
since that ball lady was trapped there!

988
01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.961
So. he doesn't have 933.

989
01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:30.172
He's got 999.

990
01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:32.925
And unless one of you
wants to start funeral arrangements...

991
01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:34.426
we better get out of here.

992
01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:40.641
Shoo! Shoo!

993
01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:43.810
Am I the only one
who didn't know that was real?

994
01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:49.107
We better hurry this up because
all these seances got the house acting up.

995
01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.945
Never mind that. every one of the deaths
that happened in this house...

996
01:00:53.111 --> 01:00:54.279
happened on a full moon.

997
01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:57.616
Which means. we have less than four days.

998
01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:01.036
Didn't Madame Leota say something
about needing an object they possessed?

999
01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:04.665
How are you gonna find an object
someone possessed...

1000
01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:06.416
when you don't know
who the "someone" is?

1001
01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.753
Now. there is something very special
that I can do.

1002
01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.338
It's quite extraordinary.

1003
01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:15.759
My spirit will leave my body
and go into the ghost realm...

1004
01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:17.886
where I can get a look at that spirit.

1005
01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:19.513
A reverse seance. if you will.

1006
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.973
A reverse seance?

1007
01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:22.140
Count me in!

1008
01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:26.103
Bruce. it's very dangerous.
Not just anyone can do a reverse seance.

1009
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.312
Astral projection.

1010
01:01:27.479 --> 01:01:29.106
Just say "astral projection."

1011
01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:31.984
You don't need to use all these words
as if you just invented them.

1012
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.652
- It's ridiculous.
- Astral projection?

1013
01:01:33.819 --> 01:01:36.071
Have you ever heard of astral projection?
Is that in your Bible?

1014
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:40.033
- Let's talk about what really is ridiculous.
- Harriet. Harriet. okay. listen.

1015
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.160
Come on. we're all on the same team here.

1016
01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:45.831
Although we're not actin' like one.
and that plays into their hands.

1017
01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:48.250
Hey. I like the idea of a reverse seance.

1018
01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:51.003
Yeah. they've been coming into our realm.
let's go visit them.

1019
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.505
You're gonna scare us?
No. we're gonna scare you!

1020
01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:54.506
- Yeah!
- Boo!

1021
01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:58.719
Yes!
We will find this evil spirit tonight!

1022
01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:04.057
Just pick the shells out. It's fine.

1023
01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:08.478
You make crunchy scrambled eggs?

1024
01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:11.648
My grandma used to do that back in the day.

1025
01:02:12.024 --> 01:02:15.235
That's when her glasses started.
Her prescription...

1026
01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.571
How's he doing?

1027
01:02:18.113 --> 01:02:21.950
I fear he may be a little young
to be processing...

1028
01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:23.911
existential dread.

1029
01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:28.207
You know. I thought that coming down here...

1030
01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:31.210
we could put everything that we went through
with his father behind us.

1031
01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:34.087
You know. he could run around.
be a kid. enjoy...

1032
01:02:34.254 --> 01:02:36.507
but this house just won't let that happen.

1033
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.134
- It's scary.
- No more eggs.

1034
01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:41.428
Speaking of egg-sistential.

1035
01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:43.222
"Egg-sistential"?

1036
01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:47.184
Oh. my God.

1037
01:02:47.351 --> 01:02:49.186
He's gonna fall off that stoop
and break his leg.

1038
01:02:49.353 --> 01:02:51.480
- Travis! Travis!
- Hey.

1039
01:02:51.647 --> 01:02:54.274
Hey. how 'bout I go talk to him?

1040
01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:55.442
Okay. just...

1041
01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:59.321
- don't egg him on.
- Eggs-actly.

1042
01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:02.157
We have to stop this. I'll be back.

1043
01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:03.367
Thank you.

1044
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.701
Go team.

1045
01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:18.882
That's him landing.

1046
01:03:21.093 --> 01:03:23.512
That is not how a flying guy sounds.

1047
01:03:23.929 --> 01:03:25.556
You're right. True.

1048
01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:29.685
What's wrong?

1049
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:34.898
Kids at school
are having a birthday party tonight.

1050
01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:37.484
Can't go. of course.

1051
01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:40.529
Not that I was invited.

1052
01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:41.822
- It's crunchy.
- It's crunchy.

1053
01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:45.367
- There's a lot of crunch in there.
- Yeah. it's like the Cap'n Crunch of eggs.

1054
01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.666
I don't know why they don't like me.

1055
01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:53.834
I mean...

1056
01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.087
I dress my best every day...

1057
01:03:57.254 --> 01:03:59.464
I always raise my hand in class...

1058
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:02.926
and I make sure everybody
follows the rules on the playground.

1059
01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:07.222
Yep. well. I think you just answered
your own question right there.

1060
01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.434
I talked to my dad today.

1061
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:14.021
Yeah. that's good.

1062
01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.482
He wants me to come visit.

1063
01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:23.530
But I think it would make my mom feel bad.

1064
01:04:27.326 --> 01:04:28.327
Don't tell her.

1065
01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.246
It'll make her so sad.

1066
01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:36.084
Well. if there's one thing I'm good at.
it's keeping secrets.

1067
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.296
And you know what?

1068
01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.759
That was a good one. yeah.

1069
01:04:43.926 --> 01:04:45.969
Just in there kicking me for some reason.

1070
01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:48.430
Action Guy.

1071
01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:51.850
Here.

1072
01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:54.686
Go ahead. take it. Yeah.

1073
01:04:55.395 --> 01:04:57.481
Be careful. He's cheap.

1074
01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:01.193
I was gonna ask you if you wanted to...
Actually. you...

1075
01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:07.282
"Say it again!"

1076
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:15.374
You got that. All right. you won.

1077
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.836
- Hey. give me Soulsucker! Hey. come back!
-"Say it again!"

1078
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.172
Dark spirit. whoever you are...

1079
01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:23.924
Harriet's comin' for ya.

1080
01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:25.259
Yeah.

1081
01:05:25.425 --> 01:05:27.594
That's got some mojo to it.

1082
01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:30.931
A little Dragon's Blood? Yerba Santa?
What are we talking about?

1083
01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:32.850
Sage from Costco.

1084
01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.561
When I leave my body
to look at this dark spirit...

1085
01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.896
I don't want anyone else jumping in it.

1086
01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:40.148
Not that I think it will get to that.

1087
01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:42.526
I've done it a thousand times.

1088
01:05:42.693 --> 01:05:45.320
You see. if you say it like that.
it makes me feel like you've never done it.

1089
01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:46.488
Yes. I have.

1090
01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:48.198
I've probably done it. like. 10.000 times.

1091
01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:51.410
Why elevate it to that level?
Then I don't believe it at all.

1092
01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:54.371
- How am I gonna get into this?
- Believe it. boo. Believe it.

1093
01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:57.708
Now. if I'm gone for more than 10 minutes...

1094
01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:59.293
ring this bell.

1095
01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:01.837
If I get lost.
it'll help me find my way back.

1096
01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:06.425
See. I have to be very raw
in order to go into the other side.

1097
01:06:06.592 --> 01:06:09.386
This is a picture of my dog...

1098
01:06:09.553 --> 01:06:13.557
that tragically moved to live on a farm.

1099
01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:16.101
Actually he got hit by a car.

1100
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.438
Bursted like a water balloon.

1101
01:06:19.605 --> 01:06:21.106
- Sis!
- Wait. what?

1102
01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:22.191
What?

1103
01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.525
We're gonna start.

1104
01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:28.739
"Spirits. I come with curious intentions.

1105
01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:32.409
"Creak open the door to your dimension.

1106
01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:35.662
"Protect my body as I leave this helm.

1107
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.292
"For now. my spirit
will enter the ghost realm."

1108
01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:45.923
Think sad thoughts. think sad thoughts.
Think sad thoughts. think sad thoughts.

1109
01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:29.633
Eleanor?

1110
01:07:30.092 --> 01:07:32.386
Gracey! Hey. we need your help!

1111
01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:34.680
You shouldn't be here.

1112
01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:37.891
Hey!

1113
01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:51.363
Gracey. wait! I want to talk to you.

1114
01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:12.259
One. two...

1115
01:08:12.843 --> 01:08:17.848
three. four. five. six. seven.

1116
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.702
Now. baby. you know I love the blues...

1117
01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:41.121
but can you play something a little more...

1118
01:08:42.038 --> 01:08:43.040
light?

1119
01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:44.875
This is all he wants to hear.

1120
01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:48.127
Keep drinking. It'll get lighter.

1121
01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.055
Don't let him catch you here.

1122
01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.106
Eleanor?

1123
01:09:09.733 --> 01:09:10.651
Gracey?

1124
01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:12.819
Gracey. you have to help me.

1125
01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:15.781
Ben...

1126
01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.533
this is all my fault.

1127
01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:19.952
This dark spirit. who is he?

1128
01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.578
No one knows his mortal name...

1129
01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:23.247
but he's not one of us.

1130
01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:26.959
His power in this realm is beyond control...

1131
01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:29.502
with many of us forced us to do his bidding.

1132
01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.881
Please. you must not let him
take the last soul.

1133
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.259
Or we'll all be trapped here forever.

1134
01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:37.511
Wait.

1135
01:09:37.678 --> 01:09:38.679
He's coming now.

1136
01:09:38.929 --> 01:09:40.555
- Leave now!
- Gracey!

1137
01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:45.269
Oh. no. he's here!

1138
01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:47.645
Follow me.

1139
01:09:47.813 --> 01:09:49.231
- This way!
- He's here.

1140
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:51.191
Take my hand!

1141
01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:52.317
Hurry! Hurry!

1142
01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:54.069
Quickly. in here.

1143
01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:56.071
Do hide. Do hide.

1144
01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.673
No. no. no.

1145
01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:17.759
No! Come on.

1146
01:10:20.053 --> 01:10:21.054
Ben.

1147
01:10:22.306 --> 01:10:23.682
Were you looking for me?

1148
01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:24.683
No. no.

1149
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:26.059
Wait.

1150
01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:31.398
What?

1151
01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:39.114
No reason to be afraid.

1152
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.619
Now. I know this place
is absolutely dripping...

1153
01:10:43.785 --> 01:10:45.787
with the most sorrowful souls...

1154
01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:49.041
all searching for what eluded them in life.

1155
01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:51.126
Searching for purpose...

1156
01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:53.545
too cowardly to do anything about it.

1157
01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:57.674
But you. you have promise.

1158
01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:00.260
You know that life has no meaning.

1159
01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:02.554
That we all end up in the dirt.

1160
01:11:03.972 --> 01:11:04.806
Boo!

1161
01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:10.854
If you're willing to help me.
I can give you what you want.

1162
01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:12.439
No! No!

1163
01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:25.619
The spirit realm is not welcoming me tonight.

1164
01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:28.789
There's no use in running!

1165
01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:33.377
Suffering is for the weak
and I know the way out.

1166
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:36.505
We have a deal to make.

1167
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.677
It's quite disappointing but...

1168
01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:45.305
But the real chill starts later.

1169
01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:46.932
That's not Ben.

1170
01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:01.363
You can get what you want...

1171
01:12:02.823 --> 01:12:05.325
if you're willing.

1172
01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:09.413
Ben!

1173
01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:13.041
It's me. it's me. it's me.

1174
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.418
I'm all right.

1175
01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:17.629
I saw him.

1176
01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.799
This was not a regular ghost.

1177
01:12:20.966 --> 01:12:22.885
Gracey was terrified.

1178
01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:24.469
I mean. they all were.

1179
01:12:24.636 --> 01:12:26.805
Come on. a ghost who haunts other ghosts?

1180
01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:29.224
That's not fair.

1181
01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:30.976
Aren't there any rules?

1182
01:12:31.143 --> 01:12:32.436
Did he look human?

1183
01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:33.437
Sorta.

1184
01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:35.147
He walked with a cane and a limp...

1185
01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:38.942
and he carried his head inside of a hatbox.

1186
01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:40.611
What part of that is "sorta"?

1187
01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:46.033
Is there anything else that we can go on
to identify this "Hatbox Ghost"?

1188
01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:51.914
I can give you what you want.

1189
01:12:52.497 --> 01:12:54.082
The face in the box. it...

1190
01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:56.919
He had this grin.

1191
01:12:57.794 --> 01:13:00.547
This grin that's just burned into my memory.

1192
01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:02.299
What was it like in there?

1193
01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:04.968
I mean. for a ghost realm.
there was just so much...

1194
01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.512
life.

1195
01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:09.473
I mean. it wasn't even really hard
to reverse seance.

1196
01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.100
No. I feel like I felt it
for a couple minutes...

1197
01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:13.685
like I was tripping.

1198
01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:17.689
- Like a out-of-body experience. Electricity.
- It was a little bit of a shake. a tingle.

1199
01:13:17.856 --> 01:13:20.442
I know. Harriet. that you can
do that thing...

1200
01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:22.903
but I think I was just feelin' so raw.

1201
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.738
No. no. it's fine.

1202
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:26.823
- I'm limited.
- No. you're not.

1203
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:28.242
It is what it is.

1204
01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:31.411
My family never believed
I had the gift either.

1205
01:13:31.578 --> 01:13:33.121
Do you have any living family?

1206
01:13:33.288 --> 01:13:36.542
Three sisters.
Bullied me every day of my life.

1207
01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:39.044
My older sister? She's just terrible.

1208
01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:42.923
My middle sister. she's just an awful person.

1209
01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:45.634
But my younger sister...

1210
01:13:47.135 --> 01:13:49.096
I actually believe she is the Devil.

1211
01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:51.181
Anyways...

1212
01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:54.268
I know I can be challenging to be around.

1213
01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:56.144
No. it's not that. Harriet.

1214
01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:57.813
He wants me.

1215
01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:04.945
I think he wants me to be his last soul.

1216
01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:07.447
No. Ben. look at me.

1217
01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:08.824
You're not alone.

1218
01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:16.999
My wife died in a car accident.

1219
01:14:18.959 --> 01:14:20.169
What was she like?

1220
01:14:21.336 --> 01:14:22.838
She was the best.

1221
01:14:23.922 --> 01:14:26.008
Yeah. she was just herself.

1222
01:14:31.013 --> 01:14:31.930
And she liked to dance.

1223
01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:34.474
<i>She couldn't dance. but she liked to.</i>

1224
01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:37.853
<i>She also was the world's slowest runner.</i>

1225
01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:40.522
<i>She'd say. "Let's go running"...</i>

1226
01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.524
and she was eating a cheesesteak
while she said this.

1227
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:45.027
Talking about.
"I'm getting my carbo load."

1228
01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:50.324
She was the type of person
that just included everyone.

1229
01:14:50.991 --> 01:14:52.409
And I was...

1230
01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:56.205
I was kinda the opposite.
People made me nervous.

1231
01:14:56.371 --> 01:14:58.373
You have no social skills at all.

1232
01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:01.585
It's true.

1233
01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:04.046
And there's...

1234
01:15:05.881 --> 01:15:09.343
no way I could have gotten
to where I've gotten without her.

1235
01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:15.849
Then one day. she...

1236
01:15:17.184 --> 01:15:19.937
She decided she was gonna go
get some tater tots.

1237
01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:21.605
She liked tater tots.

1238
01:15:22.356 --> 01:15:23.732
She asked me to go with her.

1239
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.739
And I just couldn't do it
because I was frustrated.

1240
01:15:30.906 --> 01:15:34.034
I had so much work.
and so many things I still had to do.

1241
01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:35.244
So. I...

1242
01:15:36.578 --> 01:15:37.788
So. I went off.

1243
01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:41.542
And I said.
"Not right now. I'm doing something."

1244
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.754
And then. she left.

1245
01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:49.132
Apparently. she stopped off
to get some ice cream...

1246
01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:50.676
at a little Baskin Robbins.

1247
01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:52.678
She got into an accident...

1248
01:15:52.845 --> 01:15:54.638
and about 20 minutes later...

1249
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.849
she was gone. and...

1250
01:15:57.933 --> 01:16:01.395
So. that's why I put
all my time and energy...

1251
01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:04.106
dedicated to finishing the camera.

1252
01:16:05.482 --> 01:16:07.901
Because I just wanted
to see her one more time.

1253
01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:13.448
She died alone.

1254
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:19.037
And I feel like she didn't know
that I loved her.

1255
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.375
No. I'm sure that she knew.

1256
01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:25.586
She definitely knew.

1257
01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:26.587
My God.

1258
01:16:26.753 --> 01:16:29.047
- What was the cholesterol on that woman?
- Bruce!

1259
01:16:29.214 --> 01:16:30.299
Can you imagine?

1260
01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.634
Cheesesteak. tater tots.

1261
01:16:33.886 --> 01:16:35.095
She stopped off for ice cream.

1262
01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:36.388
- Salt and fat.
- Oh. my God.

1263
01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:37.890
- That's it.
- Bruce.

1264
01:16:38.056 --> 01:16:39.683
She was going to the bone orchard!

1265
01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:42.603
- Oh. my God!
- Thank you. Bruce.

1266
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:44.813
I needed that.

1267
01:16:45.647 --> 01:16:48.609
Look. I don't know if any of us
are gonna make it out of this alive.

1268
01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:51.653
It certainly seems like Ben's a goner.
but I'll tell you...

1269
01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:54.907
I wouldn't wanna be going through this
with anyone else.

1270
01:16:59.036 --> 01:16:59.995
Wait. wait. kid...

1271
01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.373
you said the image of his face...

1272
01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.417
was burned into your brain.

1273
01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:06.710
Yeah.

1274
01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:08.295
I have an idea.

1275
01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:12.424
My friend was mugged...

1276
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.468
and he's going through the trauma
right now...

1277
01:17:14.635 --> 01:17:16.637
but what we would like is a sketch artist...

1278
01:17:16.803 --> 01:17:18.597
while it's still fresh in his mind.

1279
01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:21.808
He was tall.

1280
01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:24.520
And kinda hunched over.

1281
01:17:24.686 --> 01:17:26.021
Very thin.

1282
01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:30.484
He had hair
that was sticking out of a top hat.

1283
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:33.153
- Top hat?
- Yes. Yeah.

1284
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.571
- So. like. top hat?
- Top hat.

1285
01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:37.241
Not a bowler or a cowboy hat.

1286
01:17:37.407 --> 01:17:38.659
- Like a opera hat.
- Like a magician. yeah.

1287
01:17:38.825 --> 01:17:41.578
- A magician hat!
- You would pull a rabbit out of it. probably.

1288
01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:42.955
Eyes?

1289
01:17:43.121 --> 01:17:44.998
Far apart. close. average?

1290
01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:47.042
I think normal. Average.

1291
01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:48.669
Okay. average eyes.

1292
01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:52.256
But they were a bit sunken
into the recesses of his ocular cavity.

1293
01:17:52.422 --> 01:17:53.382
Deep eyes!

1294
01:17:53.549 --> 01:17:55.300
- Deep sunken eyes.
- Like a raccoon.

1295
01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.427
- Beady eyes!
- They were set back.

1296
01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.222
His eyes were doing that.
And no eyelids.

1297
01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:02.391
So. they're into his skull. no eyelids.

1298
01:18:02.558 --> 01:18:04.017
- What about his nose?
- No nose.

1299
01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.477
- He didn't have a...
- No nose!

1300
01:18:05.644 --> 01:18:07.312
Why would he have a nose?

1301
01:18:07.479 --> 01:18:10.858
- He was smiling.
- The man who mugged you was smiling?

1302
01:18:11.024 --> 01:18:12.150
But he didn't have lips.

1303
01:18:12.317 --> 01:18:15.863
- It was like a perpetual smile of sorts...
- Sure.

1304
01:18:16.029 --> 01:18:17.447
It was kinda...
Yeah. like that.

1305
01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:19.616
- This kind of thing.
- Exactly. yeah.

1306
01:18:19.783 --> 01:18:21.869
No lips. why not?
Why would he have lips?

1307
01:18:22.578 --> 01:18:23.996
Is this the man who mugged you?

1308
01:18:24.705 --> 01:18:25.831
- Wow!
- Whoa!

1309
01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:29.209
You just did that just now? This is amazing!

1310
01:18:29.376 --> 01:18:30.377
You know what'd be fun?

1311
01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.379
See him with skin.

1312
01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:36.508
The police station paid off!

1313
01:18:36.675 --> 01:18:38.051
Alistair Crump.

1314
01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:40.262
Very bad man. Very bad.

1315
01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:45.017
Son of cutthroat real estate tycoon.
Addison Crump.

1316
01:18:45.184 --> 01:18:49.479
<i>A cruel father who kicked Alistair out of
the house when he was just a boy...</i>

1317
01:18:49.646 --> 01:18:53.901
<i>after claiming Alistair cried too much
at his mother's funeral.</i>

1318
01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:56.486
{\an8}<i>Said he needed to make him a tougher man.</i>

1319
01:18:58.030 --> 01:19:01.825
{\an8}<i>His father's high society
turned its back on the boy.</i>

1320
01:19:01.992 --> 01:19:07.456
<i>And with no friends and no other family.
Alistair disappeared.</i>

1321
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.169
<i>Years later. following his
father's mysterious death...</i>

1322
01:19:12.544 --> 01:19:15.589
<i>Alistair returned a wealthy tycoon...</i>

1323
01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:18.717
<i>who became famous for
throwing lavish parties...</i>

1324
01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:21.136
<i>with the very people who'd betrayed him.</i>

1325
01:19:21.803 --> 01:19:25.182
<i>Only many of those guests
never made their way out!</i>

1326
01:19:26.433 --> 01:19:31.522
<i>Whispers grew that Alistair was embroiled
in a form of dark magic...</i>

1327
01:19:31.688 --> 01:19:36.527
<i>that required blood sacrifice
to maintain his wealth and power.</i>

1328
01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:38.904
{\an8}<i>No one ever found the bodies...</i>

1329
01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:43.700
{\an8}<i>but after years of abuse.
his staff finally rose up against him...</i>

1330
01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:45.244
<i>and beheaded Crump!</i>

1331
01:19:46.495 --> 01:19:48.205
<i>Just before the axe fell...</i>

1332
01:19:48.372 --> 01:19:53.085
<i>Alistair vowed revenge on all
from beyond the grave.</i>

1333
01:19:53.252 --> 01:19:56.421
Crump. a murderer in life...

1334
01:19:57.589 --> 01:20:01.134
Now. a murderer in death.

1335
01:20:02.094 --> 01:20:06.265
Fortunately. for us. his old house
was deemed a historical property...

1336
01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:07.933
up a few hours north.

1337
01:20:08.225 --> 01:20:09.977
And turned into a bed and breakfast.

1338
01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:14.356
So. we go there. get something of Crump's.
and we don't have to die.

1339
01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:15.607
We got his address.

1340
01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:16.608
Let me get my things.

1341
01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:18.026
I can go 'cause I know how
to handle the item.

1342
01:20:18.193 --> 01:20:19.069
Now I'll be back...

1343
01:20:19.236 --> 01:20:20.070
Say it again! Say it again!

1344
01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:21.572
- We're gonna get this guy.
- Yes!

1345
01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:23.448
We're closing in. that's what we're doing.
We're closing in.

1346
01:20:23.615 --> 01:20:24.950
Come on! What's up with the printer?

1347
01:20:25.117 --> 01:20:27.119
Come on. it's gotta go.

1348
01:20:27.828 --> 01:20:28.912
- It's going.
- It's on.

1349
01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:30.247
Is anybody else seeing this?

1350
01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:31.456
Yeah. I'm seeing it.

1351
01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:36.962
Leaving us already?

1352
01:20:38.172 --> 01:20:39.548
Ben. here's the address!

1353
01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:42.634
- If you make it out. get to Crump Manor!
- Oh. no!

1354
01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.554
I do love surprises.

1355
01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:48.682
And I've got a great one coming up for you.

1356
01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:50.434
Now. Travis...

1357
01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:53.979
Quicksand!

1358
01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:55.480
Travis!

1359
01:20:57.858 --> 01:20:59.193
Oh. my God. Dynamite!

1360
01:20:59.568 --> 01:21:01.653
We're trapped. look for a way out!

1361
01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:07.743
We gotta go. we gotta go now.

1362
01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:11.747
Get to the gargoyles. fast.

1363
01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.957
Travis. you gotta grab one of the gargoyles!

1364
01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:15.501
That's how we get out of here.

1365
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.671
That's great. now hold on.

1366
01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:21.298
Okay. okay. okay!

1367
01:21:23.342 --> 01:21:25.135
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Oh!

1368
01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:26.261
Don't look down.

1369
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:28.764
Ben!

1370
01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:30.474
Not today. Satan.

1371
01:21:31.225 --> 01:21:33.143
You better get back. I rebuke you!

1372
01:21:33.644 --> 01:21:35.145
Not today!

1373
01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:39.274
Bruce!

1374
01:21:42.486 --> 01:21:44.238
Those teeth look really sharp. Ben.

1375
01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:48.742
Hey. painting lady. what do we do now?

1376
01:21:48.909 --> 01:21:50.953
Whatever you're gonna do.
do it fast.

1377
01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:52.788
Come on. hurry!

1378
01:21:52.955 --> 01:21:55.457
You might want to give that ceiling
a second look.

1379
01:21:55.832 --> 01:21:58.418
Or you could end up like my husband.

1380
01:21:58.585 --> 01:21:59.670
Get us out of here!

1381
01:21:59.837 --> 01:22:00.963
One second. Travis!

1382
01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:03.173
Okay. it's getting closer!

1383
01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:04.842
You see that?

1384
01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:06.760
Climb up and you can get out!

1385
01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:08.136
Okay. okay.

1386
01:22:08.846 --> 01:22:09.680
Hurry!

1387
01:22:09.847 --> 01:22:11.390
I can't get a grip.

1388
01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:13.058
Come on. Ben.

1389
01:22:13.225 --> 01:22:14.893
Okay. Okay. I'm trying.

1390
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.316
Yes! Oh. finally.

1391
01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:28.156
Look. look. it's Kent!

1392
01:22:28.323 --> 01:22:29.241
Kent! Hey!

1393
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.036
I go to my car for five minutes
and then can't get back in the house.

1394
01:22:33.203 --> 01:22:34.079
What happened?

1395
01:22:34.246 --> 01:22:36.331
That's 'cause Crump is trying
to keep us here.

1396
01:22:36.707 --> 01:22:37.708
Bruce!

1397
01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:39.585
Bruce. get up!

1398
01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:41.920
Whoa. Whoa. Okay. okay.

1399
01:22:42.588 --> 01:22:43.589
This is all right.

1400
01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:44.756
Let's see. No.

1401
01:22:49.178 --> 01:22:50.179
Calm down.

1402
01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:55.517
- No. Crump.
- Keep your head back.

1403
01:22:55.684 --> 01:22:57.644
I'll drive. Don't worry.
We don't have time.

1404
01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:59.146
I'd love to explain to you.
but we don't have time!

1405
01:22:59.313 --> 01:23:00.314
Come on. come on.

1406
01:23:02.566 --> 01:23:03.483
Come on. get inside.

1407
01:23:08.071 --> 01:23:08.697
- Watch out!
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

1408
01:23:08.864 --> 01:23:11.241
I'm too young to die! Just keep driving!

1409
01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:12.451
It's much harder than it looks!

1410
01:23:13.076 --> 01:23:14.077
Drive! Okay.

1411
01:23:14.244 --> 01:23:15.204
- Watch... Oh. my God!
- I got it. I got it.

1412
01:23:16.622 --> 01:23:17.414
I don't want to die!

1413
01:23:17.581 --> 01:23:19.458
- Just keep driving!
- Okay. okay.

1414
01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:21.168
Put the pedal to the metal!

1415
01:23:21.335 --> 01:23:24.213
- I'm going as fast as I can go.
- The trees are attacking us!

1416
01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.382
- Oh. my God!
- Much harder than it looks. Okay.

1417
01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:31.512
There we go. there we go.

1418
01:23:35.516 --> 01:23:36.517
- Oh. my God!
- Okay.

1419
01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:38.143
- Watch where you're going.
- Okay!

1420
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.270
- Wow.
- What's going on? What's happening?

1421
01:23:41.813 --> 01:23:43.649
We found him. He is not happy.

1422
01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:45.234
And what about those guys?

1423
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.070
Well. maybe they'll help us
like the ones in the painting.

1424
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:53.992
Bruce. stay with me.

1425
01:24:03.544 --> 01:24:06.421
Not only is this a lovely bed and breakfast.
but the owners...

1426
01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:08.549
Pat and Vic. do dinner theater as well.

1427
01:24:08.715 --> 01:24:09.716
Oh. God.

1428
01:24:17.933 --> 01:24:20.102
Okay. Mr. Ghost?

1429
01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:21.144
Hi.

1430
01:24:22.062 --> 01:24:24.982
Do you mind waiting in the car
while we go get your mansion back...

1431
01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:27.943
so that you may not haunt us for eternity?

1432
01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:32.406
Thank you.

1433
01:24:33.365 --> 01:24:34.366
Thank you.

1434
01:24:36.243 --> 01:24:38.036
There's a tour starting in five minutes.

1435
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.663
Perfect timing.

1436
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:42.082
Okay. we're getting one item.
then we leave. Got it?

1437
01:24:42.249 --> 01:24:43.458
In and out. real quick.

1438
01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.461
This tour will take approximately
three hours.

1439
01:24:46.628 --> 01:24:48.672
Bathroom breaks are strictly prohibited.

1440
01:24:49.173 --> 01:24:53.177
Sir Alistair Crump wanted the grandest house
in all of the Valley.

1441
01:24:53.385 --> 01:24:56.847
You'll note there's no seating
in the foyer...

1442
01:24:57.014 --> 01:25:00.475
as he would have no man or woman seated...

1443
01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:01.768
when he entered a room.

1444
01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:03.020
That cane...

1445
01:25:03.187 --> 01:25:05.439
Did that belong to Alistair Crump. by chance?

1446
01:25:05.772 --> 01:25:07.816
No. that is my cane.

1447
01:25:07.983 --> 01:25:11.737
I use it for deeply personal reasons.

1448
01:25:12.487 --> 01:25:14.781
Does anything in this room
belong to Alistair Crump?

1449
01:25:15.449 --> 01:25:16.825
Uh. no.

1450
01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:19.286
Well. I don't know why we're here.

1451
01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:25.209
And here. if you'll notice.
this chair at the end of the table...

1452
01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:28.003
is noticeably higher than the other chairs.

1453
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.880
He had the legs shortened...

1454
01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:32.090
and he added pillows to his seat...

1455
01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.510
as to remain above everyone else.

1456
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.387
I mean. this guy was so petty.
you almost got to respect it.

1457
01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:39.515
So. are those his actual pillows?

1458
01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:40.682
No.

1459
01:25:42.434 --> 01:25:46.104
Here is a portrait
of Mr. Crump's third wife. Margaret.

1460
01:25:46.772 --> 01:25:50.609
Margaret was still just his mistress
at the time of this painting.

1461
01:25:50.776 --> 01:25:55.072
And it was through the painting
that his second wife learned of the affair...

1462
01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:58.242
when he hung it here for her to see.

1463
01:25:58.408 --> 01:25:59.326
That's one way to do it.

1464
01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:00.953
Well...

1465
01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:02.996
"I do not trust any man who reads...

1466
01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:06.875
"nor any woman who. dot. dot. dot. reads."

1467
01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.836
Was it just hard to find quotes or...

1468
01:26:09.002 --> 01:26:12.756
This comb here. did that belong to Crump?

1469
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:15.217
No. that is a replica.

1470
01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:17.177
Then why is it in a glass box?

1471
01:26:17.344 --> 01:26:19.513
Would you like to be the tour guide?

1472
01:26:20.973 --> 01:26:21.974
No.

1473
01:26:23.517 --> 01:26:24.351
No.

1474
01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:25.686
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1475
01:26:25.853 --> 01:26:28.188
I'm going to have to shut everything down.

1476
01:26:28.355 --> 01:26:29.481
There's been...

1477
01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.483
a murder.

1478
01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:34.778
Alistair Crump has been decapitated.

1479
01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:36.363
Was it the butler?

1480
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:37.531
No.

1481
01:26:37.698 --> 01:26:40.409
The ingenue from out of town?

1482
01:26:40.576 --> 01:26:41.451
She was with me.

1483
01:26:42.244 --> 01:26:44.538
I'm Vic. your other tour guide.

1484
01:26:44.705 --> 01:26:46.665
And stage and screen veteran.

1485
01:26:47.124 --> 01:26:51.295
There are many more stories like this one.
if you'll follow me into the salon.

1486
01:26:51.753 --> 01:26:53.088
Pat and Vic. they're the best!

1487
01:26:53.964 --> 01:26:55.007
A murder.

1488
01:26:55.674 --> 01:26:58.594
- I bet that head is in our room.
- It wasn't the last time.

1489
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.012
Wait. What did you say?

1490
01:27:00.554 --> 01:27:03.640
Apparently. they found Crump's body.
but not the head.

1491
01:27:03.807 --> 01:27:05.726
And the suspect walked out empty-handed.

1492
01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:07.269
So. people think...

1493
01:27:08.812 --> 01:27:10.898
the head is still here.

1494
01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:15.110
Thanks. friend.

1495
01:27:18.614 --> 01:27:19.907
- Looks like...
- We gotta find that head.

1496
01:27:20.073 --> 01:27:20.908
Yeah.

1497
01:27:21.074 --> 01:27:22.993
How are we gonna find it
if they haven't found it in 150 years?

1498
01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.411
There's another way.

1499
01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:28.248
We're not alone.

1500
01:27:30.876 --> 01:27:33.045
All right. Okay.

1501
01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:35.756
<i>We'll strike out hard.</i>

1502
01:27:36.965 --> 01:27:39.510
<i>A rocky patch of... grounds.
known to provide shelter...</i>

1503
01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:41.136
Hello.

1504
01:27:41.303 --> 01:27:43.388
I'm realizing I don't know what your name is.

1505
01:27:43.555 --> 01:27:45.516
Ben. conversational.

1506
01:27:46.099 --> 01:27:47.059
Captain?

1507
01:27:50.646 --> 01:27:51.647
How about this?

1508
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.982
What do you need?

1509
01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.319
Maybe you help us. and we'll help you.

1510
01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:02.407
Okay. that's good.

1511
01:28:02.574 --> 01:28:04.409
He's open. he's open.

1512
01:28:08.205 --> 01:28:09.206
Okay.

1513
01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:12.251
All right.

1514
01:28:12.793 --> 01:28:16.338
Write your message in the mirror.
whatever you want us to do.

1515
01:28:24.763 --> 01:28:26.640
{\an8}- The sea! The sea! Yes!
- Done.

1516
01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:29.101
- The sea. We can do that. That's very doable.
- Yeah. that's. we can.

1517
01:28:29.268 --> 01:28:31.395
You help us. we'll take you to the sea.

1518
01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:32.729
{\an8}Here.

1519
01:28:32.896 --> 01:28:35.399
Okay. what can you tell us about Crump?

1520
01:28:37.526 --> 01:28:38.527
Okay.

1521
01:29:01.967 --> 01:29:05.429
Can you believe I've barely had lessons?

1522
01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:08.599
No. no.
No singing along. please.

1523
01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.659
Oh. great. A dead end.

1524
01:29:28.702 --> 01:29:29.786
Wait a minute.

1525
01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.126
I can't fit in there.

1526
01:29:36.293 --> 01:29:37.753
Yeah. me neither.

1527
01:29:42.966 --> 01:29:43.842
No.

1528
01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:45.469
You want me to go down there?

1529
01:29:45.636 --> 01:29:47.179
Are you kidding me? I'm a child!

1530
01:29:47.346 --> 01:29:48.847
Yes. this is true...

1531
01:29:49.014 --> 01:29:51.266
and you don't have to go down there.

1532
01:29:51.767 --> 01:29:52.684
However...

1533
01:29:53.268 --> 01:29:55.270
- you gotta go down there.
- You gotta go.

1534
01:30:05.489 --> 01:30:08.450
- You all right? You good?
- No! This is a tunnel of terrors!

1535
01:30:08.617 --> 01:30:09.451
Oh. no!

1536
01:30:26.468 --> 01:30:27.761
{\an8}Oh. my gosh.

1537
01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:30.764
This is where he hid all the bodies.

1538
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:54.454
- Travis?
- Travis. are you okay?

1539
01:30:54.955 --> 01:30:56.874
Travis. are you all right? You good?

1540
01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.584
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

1541
01:31:06.008 --> 01:31:08.010
Well. I hope everyone's okay
back at the house.

1542
01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:10.262
Look.

1543
01:31:12.431 --> 01:31:13.432
What is it?

1544
01:31:13.599 --> 01:31:14.892
Tater tots.

1545
01:31:15.058 --> 01:31:16.727
- It's a ghost wink.
- Let me see.

1546
01:31:17.311 --> 01:31:18.312
No.

1547
01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:20.939
Those are my jalapeño poppers.

1548
01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:23.108
Look a lot like tots to me.

1549
01:31:23.483 --> 01:31:24.526
Oh. my God.

1550
01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:37.372
Did we make it in time?

1551
01:31:37.539 --> 01:31:38.665
Everything looks normal.

1552
01:31:38.832 --> 01:31:41.960
Of course. normal for this place
is terrifying.

1553
01:31:43.003 --> 01:31:46.298
Yeah. listen.
if we're not back in two hours...

1554
01:31:46.465 --> 01:31:48.258
and I never thought I'd say this...

1555
01:31:48.425 --> 01:31:49.426
call the police.

1556
01:31:50.511 --> 01:31:51.345
Wait.

1557
01:31:51.762 --> 01:31:52.888
Wait a minute. Wait. wait.

1558
01:31:53.055 --> 01:31:55.766
Travis. you gotta stay
in the car for me. okay?

1559
01:31:55.933 --> 01:31:58.727
But I did so good! I got us the top hat.

1560
01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:00.312
Just let me be a part of this.

1561
01:32:01.063 --> 01:32:03.732
Listen. Travis. it's just too dangerous.

1562
01:32:07.027 --> 01:32:10.113
- Fine. I'll try my dad.
- Okay.

1563
01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:14.493
Stay here. okay?
Give me.

1564
01:32:24.878 --> 01:32:26.129
Let's do this. baby.

1565
01:32:27.923 --> 01:32:29.591
Kent. come on. man. What are you...

1566
01:32:30.008 --> 01:32:33.595
If this comes down to an exorcism.
we're in big trouble.

1567
01:32:34.388 --> 01:32:36.515
- Why...
- Because I don't know what I'm doing.

1568
01:32:36.682 --> 01:32:38.308
I'm not even a priest!

1569
01:32:38.475 --> 01:32:39.977
I work in Halloween supplies.

1570
01:32:40.143 --> 01:32:42.563
I just put this on
just to make some extra scratch.

1571
01:32:42.729 --> 01:32:44.648
Yeah. everyone wants to think
their house is haunted...

1572
01:32:44.815 --> 01:32:47.776
so I go sprinkle some holy water
and get paid.

1573
01:32:47.943 --> 01:32:49.069
I'm a fraud.

1574
01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:51.196
I'm sorry.

1575
01:32:52.948 --> 01:32:53.866
You...

1576
01:32:57.703 --> 01:33:00.414
Listen. I don't know what you are.
and I don't even really care.

1577
01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:01.915
All I know is that you helped...

1578
01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:03.250
You helped me!

1579
01:33:03.417 --> 01:33:08.005
Yeah. you helped me see in myself
that I had something that was useful.

1580
01:33:08.172 --> 01:33:09.131
You taught me that.

1581
01:33:09.298 --> 01:33:11.466
And whatever is in that house.
whatever it is that we gotta face...

1582
01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:13.552
we can't face it without you. all right?

1583
01:33:13.719 --> 01:33:15.804
- No.
- Father Kent.

1584
01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:17.472
Now. let me ask you something.

1585
01:33:18.932 --> 01:33:20.100
You wanna be a hero?

1586
01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:24.104
- No.
- See?

1587
01:33:24.855 --> 01:33:27.357
You can't use my lines back against me.

1588
01:33:28.066 --> 01:33:29.985
So. let's go! Let's do this!

1589
01:33:30.652 --> 01:33:32.362
- Come on. baby.
- I'm gonna need a drink.

1590
01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:37.701
It's almost midnight.

1591
01:33:37.868 --> 01:33:40.329
Yeah. we need Harriet
to do this banishment spell now.

1592
01:33:43.624 --> 01:33:44.833
Harriet?

1593
01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:53.467
I'm afraid of...

1594
01:33:55.135 --> 01:33:57.179
Bruce. you gotta stop doing that.

1595
01:33:57.346 --> 01:33:58.263
Where is everybody?

1596
01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:00.974
The house is clear. It's over.

1597
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:05.979
Harriet found some mumbo jumbo in that book.

1598
01:34:07.064 --> 01:34:09.066
Things got quite hairy...

1599
01:34:09.233 --> 01:34:12.194
but the shared struggle was necessary...

1600
01:34:12.361 --> 01:34:14.029
for character growth.

1601
01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:16.073
Okay. so where's Harriet and Gabbie?

1602
01:34:19.618 --> 01:34:21.328
General store.

1603
01:34:22.037 --> 01:34:23.038
Taffy.

1604
01:34:23.622 --> 01:34:24.998
- They went to get taffy?
- Yes!

1605
01:34:25.165 --> 01:34:27.417
They went shopping!
Drink up!

1606
01:34:27.584 --> 01:34:30.045
Actually. I'm good. Thank you.

1607
01:34:30.212 --> 01:34:31.755
I'm gonna go find them.

1608
01:34:35.884 --> 01:34:37.052
And then there were two.

1609
01:34:37.553 --> 01:34:39.346
It's happy hour somewhere. right?

1610
01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:40.681
"Happy hour."

1611
01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:43.392
What a turn of phrase.

1612
01:34:45.269 --> 01:34:46.353
Happy hour!

1613
01:34:57.489 --> 01:34:58.490
Dad...

1614
01:34:59.658 --> 01:35:00.868
I'm scared.

1615
01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:07.291
<i>Is that the hat?</i>

1616
01:35:07.457 --> 01:35:09.668
No. actually. it's just the replica.

1617
01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:11.378
Can I see it?

1618
01:35:15.299 --> 01:35:16.967
Bruce. are you okay?

1619
01:35:17.134 --> 01:35:18.135
Here's what's gonna happen.

1620
01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:20.554
You're gonna give me the hat.

1621
01:35:21.096 --> 01:35:23.599
You're gonna walk out of this house...

1622
01:35:23.932 --> 01:35:25.642
and never come back.

1623
01:35:28.312 --> 01:35:30.063
- I got you. I got you.
- Where's Travis?

1624
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.732
- Give me the hat!
- Bruce. no!

1625
01:35:31.899 --> 01:35:33.358
Give me that. Give it!

1626
01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:35.027
- Give it!
- No! No!

1627
01:35:39.406 --> 01:35:40.365
The Good Book!

1628
01:35:46.163 --> 01:35:48.207
I'm gonna get you. Harriet.
And Gabbie. I'll untie you in a second.

1629
01:35:48.373 --> 01:35:49.208
Travis!

1630
01:35:49.791 --> 01:35:51.126
Dang. girl. you fast.

1631
01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:24.326
- It's a full moon. Crump has all his powers!
- Harriet. start the banishment.

1632
01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:25.953
- Okay. okay. okay.
- You got this.

1633
01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:29.414
When hinges creak in doorless chambers...

1634
01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.083
and strange and...

1635
01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:35.671
Thank you for your assistance. Professor.

1636
01:36:38.465 --> 01:36:39.466
Bruce!

1637
01:36:45.556 --> 01:36:48.183
This wretched place is stifling me.

1638
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:50.519
I think it's time for me to go.

1639
01:36:50.686 --> 01:36:51.770
I'm going to get the hat.

1640
01:36:53.188 --> 01:36:54.147
Scratch the hat.

1641
01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:58.819
There are 999 souls that reside here!

1642
01:36:58.986 --> 01:37:00.779
But there's always room...

1643
01:37:01.655 --> 01:37:02.823
for one more.

1644
01:37:03.615 --> 01:37:04.658
And to think...

1645
01:37:05.158 --> 01:37:08.036
it could have been you. Ben.

1646
01:37:10.497 --> 01:37:12.583
Travis? Where's Travis?

1647
01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:16.461
Travis is okay. all right?
He's at the car. he's talking to his dad.

1648
01:37:16.628 --> 01:37:18.046
What? That's not possible!

1649
01:37:18.213 --> 01:37:20.465
Gabbie. he still talks to his father.

1650
01:37:20.632 --> 01:37:22.009
His father is dead. Ben.

1651
01:37:22.843 --> 01:37:24.219
Just over a year ago.

1652
01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:28.974
Surprise!

1653
01:37:30.809 --> 01:37:31.935
I wanna see you. too.

1654
01:37:32.102 --> 01:37:33.687
But. how?

1655
01:37:36.523 --> 01:37:39.359
I have my willing soul.

1656
01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:40.569
Oh. my God!

1657
01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.489
I hate to be a terrible host and run...

1658
01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:47.618
but I have a reunion to get to.

1659
01:37:47.784 --> 01:37:49.870
Don't worry. you won't be alone.

1660
01:37:50.037 --> 01:37:52.206
Oh. good.
And now he's conjuring up a ghost army.

1661
01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:56.251
Let my friends show you around.

1662
01:37:57.503 --> 01:37:58.462
Toodle-oo.

1663
01:38:01.882 --> 01:38:02.925
Travis...

1664
01:38:04.301 --> 01:38:06.803
Okay. all we have to do is get to that hat.

1665
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:08.722
Okay. Harriet. you're gonna
go see Madame Leota.

1666
01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.015
Maybe she'll know what to do.

1667
01:38:10.182 --> 01:38:12.518
- Gabbie. you and me will go find Travis.
- Yes.

1668
01:38:12.809 --> 01:38:14.770
Bruce. you're gonna stay right here. okay?

1669
01:38:14.937 --> 01:38:18.106
You're gonna go grab the hat
as soon as these ghosts leave. okay?

1670
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:19.566
Why would the ghosts leave?

1671
01:38:19.733 --> 01:38:22.361
Because you have the most important job
of them all. Kent.

1672
01:38:22.528 --> 01:38:23.570
You're the diversion.

1673
01:38:23.737 --> 01:38:24.947
We're running out of time!

1674
01:38:25.405 --> 01:38:26.823
- Come on. Go.
- Come on.

1675
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.908
Kent...

1676
01:38:28.075 --> 01:38:29.409
I have faith in you.

1677
01:38:32.621 --> 01:38:33.997
Leota!

1678
01:38:40.045 --> 01:38:41.004
Travis!

1679
01:38:41.171 --> 01:38:43.173
He's trying to keep Travis away from us!

1680
01:38:51.723 --> 01:38:52.683
Travis.

1681
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:54.476
Dad?

1682
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:04.736
- Gabbie! Gabbie!
- Ben!

1683
01:39:08.115 --> 01:39:09.116
Time to divert.

1684
01:39:09.533 --> 01:39:10.826
You wanna step to me?

1685
01:39:10.993 --> 01:39:12.536
'Cause I got an exorcism for you.

1686
01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:14.079
Starting now.

1687
01:39:14.538 --> 01:39:16.456
The wicked shall be driven from this house.

1688
01:39:16.832 --> 01:39:19.334
Madame Leota? Madame Leota.

1689
01:39:20.043 --> 01:39:21.336
We need your help.

1690
01:39:21.503 --> 01:39:24.673
I tried to banish him.
but he's just way too strong.

1691
01:39:25.048 --> 01:39:28.260
The only chance we have
to defeat him...

1692
01:39:28.677 --> 01:39:30.929
is combining our might.

1693
01:39:31.555 --> 01:39:33.765
You must release me.

1694
01:39:33.932 --> 01:39:35.726
The power of Kent compels you!

1695
01:39:35.726 --> 01:39:37.686
<i>Ipso facto. Carpe Diem.</i>

1696
01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:39.104
Go. now!

1697
01:39:40.939 --> 01:39:42.191
Just like I thought.

1698
01:39:42.608 --> 01:39:44.902
Exorcism went right over your head.
You know why?

1699
01:39:45.068 --> 01:39:47.946
'Cause you're too stupid to understand Latin!

1700
01:39:50.532 --> 01:39:51.658
Keep going. it's working.

1701
01:39:51.825 --> 01:39:53.202
Bunch of ignorant ghosts.

1702
01:39:54.369 --> 01:39:56.205
That's right. I said it. Morons.

1703
01:39:58.624 --> 01:39:59.917
I'm gonna die.

1704
01:40:02.878 --> 01:40:04.463
Gracey. I need your help!

1705
01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:06.215
You need to help me find Travis.

1706
01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:08.842
Hey. Gracey.

1707
01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:11.178
Hey. you gotta help me!

1708
01:40:11.345 --> 01:40:12.346
This way.

1709
01:40:12.513 --> 01:40:15.140
With the realms blending.
we can find a faster route.

1710
01:40:17.434 --> 01:40:20.395
There is a spell in my book.

1711
01:40:20.562 --> 01:40:25.984
But it can only be recited by someone
with a profound gift.

1712
01:40:27.611 --> 01:40:31.949
You may not believe in yourself
but I believe in you.

1713
01:40:32.407 --> 01:40:36.870
Set me free
and I will help you banish him.

1714
01:40:41.124 --> 01:40:43.502
Travis? Is that you?

1715
01:40:44.545 --> 01:40:45.921
Dad. I'm here.

1716
01:40:52.302 --> 01:40:53.804
No. No. No.

1717
01:40:54.555 --> 01:40:55.806
Bruce. hurry!

1718
01:40:56.765 --> 01:40:58.517
I can't buy you much more time!

1719
01:41:00.185 --> 01:41:01.603
Oh. no! No!

1720
01:41:04.731 --> 01:41:06.066
I'll go find the others.

1721
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:08.819
Ben. good luck.

1722
01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:10.612
Thank you. Gracey.

1723
01:41:14.199 --> 01:41:15.117
Travis!

1724
01:41:20.205 --> 01:41:22.249
Travis. Travis. I need you
to give me your hand!

1725
01:41:22.708 --> 01:41:24.251
I'm going to see my dad.

1726
01:41:24.543 --> 01:41:26.086
Look. I made a mistake. okay?

1727
01:41:26.253 --> 01:41:27.796
I was wrong. Your dad's not here.

1728
01:41:27.963 --> 01:41:30.132
I'm so sorry about that.
but we don't have time. okay?

1729
01:41:30.299 --> 01:41:31.258
Come on. give me your hand.

1730
01:41:31.425 --> 01:41:33.552
No. but I can hear him.

1731
01:41:33.719 --> 01:41:36.180
Travis. who is that man?

1732
01:41:36.346 --> 01:41:38.974
Hey. listen. think about it.
Think about it.

1733
01:41:39.141 --> 01:41:42.186
Your dad would want you to be safe and sound
with your mom.

1734
01:41:42.352 --> 01:41:45.480
- Now. I need you to trust me.
- No. I hate it here!

1735
01:41:45.647 --> 01:41:46.732
I know. but you and your mom...

1736
01:41:46.899 --> 01:41:48.400
are gonna be somewhere
completely different than this.

1737
01:41:48.567 --> 01:41:50.027
I hate it everywhere!

1738
01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.530
Nowhere feels right without him.

1739
01:41:56.575 --> 01:41:57.784
Listen. Travis...

1740
01:41:57.951 --> 01:42:00.287
I know the pain you feel. I feel it. too.

1741
01:42:01.079 --> 01:42:03.207
But I need you to trust me right now.
all right?

1742
01:42:03.373 --> 01:42:05.709
You come here.
you tell me all about your misery.

1743
01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.128
We'll be miserable together
until there's nothing left.

1744
01:42:08.295 --> 01:42:09.922
Travis. don't you miss me?

1745
01:42:10.088 --> 01:42:11.548
Your dad. he loves you. okay?

1746
01:42:11.715 --> 01:42:14.384
Now. he wants to see
and feel you thrive and live!

1747
01:42:14.551 --> 01:42:15.552
Come on. Travis.

1748
01:42:15.719 --> 01:42:16.762
So. come on.

1749
01:42:16.929 --> 01:42:17.763
Come on!

1750
01:42:18.138 --> 01:42:20.349
Travis. don't believe him.
He's not your father.

1751
01:42:20.516 --> 01:42:22.935
Don't let him get in your head.
Come on. you can do it.

1752
01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:25.229
We can be together again! Don't do this!

1753
01:42:25.395 --> 01:42:28.357
He feeds on your grief.
You gotta let it go. Travis.

1754
01:42:28.524 --> 01:42:30.317
You gotta let it go. okay?

1755
01:42:30.901 --> 01:42:32.736
Okay. all right. you got it. you got it.

1756
01:42:32.903 --> 01:42:33.946
You got it.

1757
01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:35.948
Don't. Don't leave me. please.

1758
01:42:36.365 --> 01:42:37.991
Come on. All right. Okay.

1759
01:42:38.158 --> 01:42:39.743
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1760
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:41.119
I got you. I got you.

1761
01:42:41.703 --> 01:42:43.288
You're good. You did good. Okay?

1762
01:42:43.455 --> 01:42:44.289
Okay.

1763
01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:47.960
That's not good.

1764
01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:52.798
Come on. Travis.
We got this.

1765
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.384
Good luck! Down there is a way out.

1766
01:42:55.551 --> 01:42:56.552
Travis!

1767
01:42:57.010 --> 01:42:58.011
Oh. thank God!

1768
01:42:58.178 --> 01:42:59.179
- Come on!
- We gotta go!

1769
01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:01.890
- Mom!
- Go. go. go!

1770
01:43:02.057 --> 01:43:03.517
Go! Run!

1771
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:26.164
I told you...

1772
01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:28.792
all roads lead to me.

1773
01:43:29.459 --> 01:43:32.880
And let me make myself clear.

1774
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:38.343
Either I haunt this boy and his mummy
for all eternity...

1775
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.763
or you and I make a deal.

1776
01:43:42.598 --> 01:43:44.600
All you have to be...

1777
01:43:45.726 --> 01:43:46.768
is willing.

1778
01:43:47.811 --> 01:43:49.062
- No. no. No.
- Ben.

1779
01:43:49.646 --> 01:43:52.816
- Don't listen to him.
- I won't let him hurt Travis or you.

1780
01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.068
Don't do this. Ben. please.

1781
01:43:57.946 --> 01:43:59.448
- Don't do it!
- Ben. no!

1782
01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:13.670
Enough. That's it.

1783
01:44:15.464 --> 01:44:16.590
And look at yourselves.

1784
01:44:17.174 --> 01:44:19.384
Is this really how you want
to spend eternity?

1785
01:44:19.927 --> 01:44:20.969
Chasing people?

1786
01:44:21.637 --> 01:44:24.389
Well. you know what?
You're not that scary. you're really not.

1787
01:44:24.556 --> 01:44:26.725
And... Well. you're pretty terrifying.

1788
01:44:27.309 --> 01:44:29.520
Can you turn around.
just while I finish this rant?

1789
01:44:30.312 --> 01:44:31.313
Thank you.

1790
01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:38.362
Excellent choice. Ben.

1791
01:44:38.779 --> 01:44:42.282
They could never help
what's broken inside of you.

1792
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.576
<i>Crump is using you.</i>

1793
01:44:44.743 --> 01:44:47.287
He's using you to do his own dirty work.
and for what?

1794
01:44:47.621 --> 01:44:50.165
To remain trapped in this house forever?

1795
01:44:50.791 --> 01:44:52.835
And believe me.
I know a con when I see one.

1796
01:44:53.377 --> 01:44:55.629
In fact. this was all a con.

1797
01:44:55.796 --> 01:44:58.173
Yeah. this whole chase was just a diversion.

1798
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.009
<i>While you were distracted.
we've been getting the hat.</i>

1799
01:45:01.176 --> 01:45:03.846
<i>So maybe today is the day you risk it all...</i>

1800
01:45:04.012 --> 01:45:05.264
<i>and join the winning team.</i>

1801
01:45:06.139 --> 01:45:09.560
The day you finally rise up as one...

1802
01:45:09.726 --> 01:45:13.063
and ask yourself. are you ready to be a hero?

1803
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:18.360
Oh. my God.

1804
01:45:20.487 --> 01:45:21.530
I have your word...

1805
01:45:21.697 --> 01:45:24.032
you're gonna leave them alone
and you're never gonna haunt them again?

1806
01:45:24.199 --> 01:45:27.286
Your soul is the last I'll ever need.

1807
01:45:29.079 --> 01:45:30.289
You know what to do.

1808
01:45:30.455 --> 01:45:32.416
You can save them.

1809
01:45:34.209 --> 01:45:36.587
Ben! You have friends here!

1810
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:40.841
From the moment you stepped foot
into this house...

1811
01:45:41.175 --> 01:45:43.886
<i>I could almost taste your grief.</i>

1812
01:45:44.094 --> 01:45:46.305
I know what you've been longing for.

1813
01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:47.472
Don't listen to him.

1814
01:45:47.973 --> 01:45:48.974
Say it!

1815
01:45:50.434 --> 01:45:51.602
I'm willing!

1816
01:45:51.768 --> 01:45:53.312
Take my hand...

1817
01:45:53.478 --> 01:45:56.773
and you will be with your beloved Alyssa.

1818
01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.567
Because in this realm...

1819
01:45:58.734 --> 01:46:00.777
you have no one.

1820
01:46:04.823 --> 01:46:05.908
Harriet?

1821
01:46:06.074 --> 01:46:07.451
It's too late.

1822
01:46:08.869 --> 01:46:11.163
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Crump.

1823
01:46:14.499 --> 01:46:16.543
You imprisoned me.

1824
01:46:16.710 --> 01:46:19.004
Now it's time to return the favor.

1825
01:46:19.630 --> 01:46:20.631
I set her free.

1826
01:46:20.797 --> 01:46:22.007
I did that.

1827
01:46:22.382 --> 01:46:23.509
Pathetic.

1828
01:46:23.675 --> 01:46:24.968
See to them.

1829
01:46:30.474 --> 01:46:32.100
They'll have to come through me first.

1830
01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:34.853
And by "me." she means "we"!

1831
01:46:37.773 --> 01:46:40.567
You've all betrayed me for the last time.

1832
01:46:41.026 --> 01:46:42.361
You'll regret that.

1833
01:46:44.863 --> 01:46:46.031
I got the hat!

1834
01:46:46.198 --> 01:46:46.990
Bruce!

1835
01:46:48.158 --> 01:46:49.326
Stop him!

1836
01:46:49.493 --> 01:46:53.038
- Bring it to us. We must banish him now!
- Yeah.

1837
01:46:53.205 --> 01:46:55.040
I'm done with you. old man.

1838
01:46:55.207 --> 01:46:56.208
Destroy them!

1839
01:46:56.375 --> 01:46:57.626
- Bruce!
- Bruce!

1840
01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:04.633
We still need a piece of the item.

1841
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.801
I got it. I can help.

1842
01:47:05.968 --> 01:47:07.678
No. no. no. Travis!

1843
01:47:08.428 --> 01:47:09.429
Get...

1844
01:47:10.889 --> 01:47:11.890
I'm coming. Bruce!

1845
01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:12.933
Help Travis!

1846
01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.059
- Over here!
- This way!

1847
01:47:14.977 --> 01:47:16.103
- I'm coming!
- Enough.

1848
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:17.896
I'll have to do this myself.

1849
01:47:19.398 --> 01:47:21.316
Wait. wait! You're right.

1850
01:47:21.567 --> 01:47:24.862
You're absolutely right.
About me. about my grief.

1851
01:47:27.573 --> 01:47:28.448
Take the hat.

1852
01:47:29.324 --> 01:47:30.325
These people...

1853
01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:32.286
You cannot escape.

1854
01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:34.913
They can't save me from my grief.

1855
01:47:37.124 --> 01:47:38.000
I'm coming!

1856
01:47:40.961 --> 01:47:43.213
- Got it!
- Harriet. you have the power.

1857
01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.882
Finish him!

1858
01:47:49.219 --> 01:47:50.679
But they can save me from you.

1859
01:47:50.846 --> 01:47:53.640
When hinges creak in doorless chambers...

1860
01:47:55.809 --> 01:47:58.770
where the air is deathly still...

1861
01:47:59.688 --> 01:48:01.899
these souls will not be displaced.

1862
01:48:03.942 --> 01:48:06.820
Return them to their final resting place!

1863
01:48:07.362 --> 01:48:08.780
Ben. No.

1864
01:48:09.323 --> 01:48:10.782
Yes! Say it again!

1865
01:48:10.949 --> 01:48:12.284
Return!

1866
01:48:13.785 --> 01:48:17.831
I will torment your friends for all eternity.

1867
01:48:17.998 --> 01:48:19.082
Say it again!

1868
01:48:19.249 --> 01:48:20.918
Return!

1869
01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:24.296
Return!

1870
01:48:28.258 --> 01:48:29.218
Ben!

1871
01:48:29.384 --> 01:48:31.553
Come with me to see your wife.

1872
01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.224
This is your last chance to tell Alyssa
that you love her.

1873
01:48:51.490 --> 01:48:52.699
She knows.

1874
01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.410
Ben.

1875
01:48:55.577 --> 01:48:56.828
No.

1876
01:48:56.995 --> 01:48:58.080
No!

1877
01:49:08.257 --> 01:49:09.258
Yes!

1878
01:49:09.424 --> 01:49:12.970
We did it! Come on.
Come here. you scary son of a gun.

1879
01:49:23.355 --> 01:49:25.107
I think you got your house back now.

1880
01:49:35.576 --> 01:49:36.577
Ben!

1881
01:49:38.704 --> 01:49:40.497
- You're okay!
- Wow. you did so good.

1882
01:49:41.665 --> 01:49:42.749
Wow.

1883
01:49:42.916 --> 01:49:44.042
Thank you.

1884
01:49:48.297 --> 01:49:50.007
- Get in here.
- You were so brave. So proud of you.

1885
01:49:50.174 --> 01:49:53.051
- Ben. just like in the history books.
- We couldn't do it without you.

1886
01:49:55.721 --> 01:49:57.055
And now you're free!

1887
01:49:57.222 --> 01:49:59.224
Free to return to the ghost realm.

1888
01:49:59.516 --> 01:50:00.517
Go on!

1889
01:50:01.393 --> 01:50:02.728
Disperse!

1890
01:50:04.771 --> 01:50:06.857
Okay. look.
we gotta talk about boundaries.

1891
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:12.738
I sense that many of these ghosts
don't want to move on.

1892
01:50:13.822 --> 01:50:14.823
What about you?

1893
01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.159
The spell will fade soon.

1894
01:50:17.326 --> 01:50:19.286
I will return to my crystal ball.

1895
01:50:20.162 --> 01:50:22.789
No. it's actually quite spacious inside.

1896
01:50:25.042 --> 01:50:26.919
This house is where I belong.

1897
01:50:46.772 --> 01:50:49.942
Yeah. these ghosts definitely
don't wanna leave this house.

1898
01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:54.279
- They can have it.
- Well. you know...

1899
01:50:54.446 --> 01:50:57.074
somebody's gonna have to
watch after them. right?

1900
01:50:58.909 --> 01:50:59.910
Boom.

1901
01:51:13.298 --> 01:51:14.675
It's all right.

1902
01:51:14.842 --> 01:51:16.009
Go on. go on. don't be scared.

1903
01:51:16.176 --> 01:51:17.010
Go ahead.

1904
01:51:42.327 --> 01:51:43.954
- Hey.
- Hey.

1905
01:51:44.872 --> 01:51:47.249
Make sure you take care of her things. okay?

1906
01:51:47.416 --> 01:51:52.379
Well. it's gonna make some lucky lady
at my parish very happy.

1907
01:51:52.546 --> 01:51:54.047
You don't have a parish.

1908
01:51:54.214 --> 01:51:55.674
I still like to give.

1909
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:57.551
You okay?

1910
01:51:59.261 --> 01:52:00.345
I'm okay.

1911
01:52:01.305 --> 01:52:03.098
Well. bop 'til you drop.

1912
01:52:04.683 --> 01:52:06.101
See you tonight.

1913
01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:08.562
Hey.

1914
01:52:10.063 --> 01:52:11.231
Hey. there.

1915
01:52:13.108 --> 01:52:14.109
How you doing?

1916
01:52:17.946 --> 01:52:18.947
So pretty.

1917
01:52:21.366 --> 01:52:22.576
What's this you got here?

1918
01:52:23.827 --> 01:52:24.870
What's your name?

1919
01:52:58.612 --> 01:53:00.364
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi!

1920
01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:02.491
The lecture went on a little long...

1921
01:53:03.075 --> 01:53:04.201
