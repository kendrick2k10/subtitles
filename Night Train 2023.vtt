Yeah. I get that a lot.

110
00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:16.654
- Well. let's hope
looks are deceiving.

111
00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.019
I'm Case Officer Connolly.
this is my office.

114
00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:26.158
Jackson. I have a problem.

115
00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.797
which means now
you have a problem.

116
00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:30.701
There's a cartel kingpin
south of the border.

117
00:05:30.736 --> 00:05:33.671
He's a friend because
nothing really

118
00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:35.068
makes any sense anymore.

119
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:38.445
So. the truckloads
of pure uncut cocaine

120
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.712
he is trafficking in our
country. not a problem.

121
00:05:41.747 --> 00:05:43.109
This entrepreneur however.

122
00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:45.848
has branched out into
black-market medical supplies.

123
00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:48.851
and that is not bueno.
(fist knocking)

124
00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:49.819
- No esta bien.

125
00:05:51.658 --> 00:05:54.186
- See. our friend is pissing off

126
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:56.562
some really scary people now.

127
00:05:56.597 --> 00:05:59.565
- Who's scarier than
the Mexican cartel?

128
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.764
- American big Pharma.

129
00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:02.601
- Oh.

130
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.737
Who do we work for again?

131
00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:08.739
- Contraband's already
in the country.

132
00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:09.872
They don't want it in Vegas.

133
00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:10.741
Vegas is a hub.

134
00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:12.204
Spreads out from Vegas.

135
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:14.679
Remember the not bueno thing?

136
00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:15.780
That's where you come in.

137
00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:18.650
'cause I am told that you
like to do a lotta leg work.

138
00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:20.916
- You know this
is all BS. right?

139
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.117
- I do.
- Hm.

140
00:06:24.152 --> 00:06:25.822
- And I don't care anymore.

141
00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:30.629
What about you. Jackson?

142
00:06:31.863 --> 00:06:32.862
Do you care anymore?

143
00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:35.700
- (inhales) I just
spent the last year

144
00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:36.866

145
00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:38.505
It's nearly six a.m.

146
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.068
I'm just a tough ol' dog
looking for a bone to chew on.

147
00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.137
I couldn't give a damn.

148
00:06:45.514 --> 00:06:46.843
- Well. looks like
you're my girl.

149
00:06:46.878 --> 00:06:49.747

152
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:04.058

153
00:07:04.093 --> 00:07:04.894
- Hey. Mom.

154
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:09.767
I made cereal already.

155
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:11.868

158
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:20.712
- That's debatable.

159
00:07:21.614 --> 00:07:24.177
- Grandma said a
curse word yesterday.

160
00:07:24.212 --> 00:07:25.046
- Oh. yeah?

161
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:27.246
What'd she say?

162
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.084
- I'm not falling
for that (laughs).

163
00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:31.723
- (laughs) Get your PT's?

164
00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:32.559
- [Shelby] Mm hm.

165
00:07:32.594 --> 00:07:33.725

166
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.559
- Mm hm.

167
00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:36.959
- All right. you
get one free pass.

168
00:07:38.633 --> 00:07:39.962
- She said dumb ass.

169
00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:42.833
- Did she call you a
dumb ass or grandpa?

170
00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:43.702
- Grandpa.

171
00:07:44.903 --> 00:07:46.837
- Well. can't argue
with the facts.

172
00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:59.245
Ugh. I think this milk
went bad a long time ago.

179
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:18.836

00:08:25.108 --> 00:08:27.911
(upbeat music)

183
00:08:35.624 --> 00:08:36.590
- Whoa. hey.

184
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.251
Hey. doofus. put that down.

185
00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:39.989
You're gonna throw
your back out.

186
00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:41.089
Let me. okay?

187
00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:43.256
Oh my God.

188
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.259
(Holly laughs)

189
00:08:46.294 --> 00:08:47.296
I got it (grunting).

190
00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:52.705
- Yo. what's up?

191
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.838
- Hey.
- Zack Harper.

192
00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:55.235
I'm gonna be workin'
with you guys.

193
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.702
Gonna be a great campaign.
- Good to see you.

194
00:08:55.737 --> 00:08:57.006
Welcome aboard.

195
00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:58.304
- Thanks. man.
- Good to have you here.

196
00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:59.679
- Appreciate it.
- You got everything you need?

197
00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:00.647
- [Zack] Yeah. I
think we're all good.

198
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:01.373
- All set?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:02.308
- You got it all. everything?

200
00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:03.111
- Yeah.
- All right.

201
00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:04.244
Excited to have you.

202
00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.685
Ready to go?
- Yeah. let's do it.

203
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.279
- [Director] Okay.
man. good deal.

204
00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:06.879
- [Zack] Good. good.

205
00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:07.984
- God. I hate that guy.

206
00:09:09.922 --> 00:09:10.754
- Great.
- Thank you.

207
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.823
- Hey. can't wait.
- All right. man.

208
00:09:11.858 --> 00:09:12.626
- Can't wait.

209
00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:14.826
- [Director] Yep.

210
00:09:14.861 --> 00:09:17.257
(upbeat music)

211
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.766
- Bro. I'm tellin' you.

212
00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:22.295
I'm so done with these
stupid commercials.

213
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.670
It's killin' my image.

214
00:09:23.705 --> 00:09:24.604
Should be starring
in the movies.

215
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.805
not high ho and west
in the desert here.

216
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.675
It's dry. man.

217
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.874
Just get it done. all right?

218
00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:31.337
I'm tired of talking about this.

219
00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:33.977
(mellow music)

220
00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:43.756
- Heads up.

221
00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:49.058
You gotta take a bow.

222
00:09:57.464 --> 00:09:58.298
- Come on.

223
00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:00.399
- Okay.

224
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:01.367
Hear me out.

225
00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.841
- [Tommy] Uh huh?

226
00:10:02.876 --> 00:10:05.173
- I'm thinking. I stay
with the compound set up.

227
00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:09.012
but get this. with
a '72 and a '91.

228
00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:10.442
I mean. how cool would that be?

229
00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:12.983
- Yeah. really cool.

230
00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:14.281
if you like lag.

231
00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:16.019
- Mm. not as much
as I like boost.

232
00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:18.725
What do ya think?

233
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.793
You up for installing it?

234
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.058
I'll make it worth your while.

235
00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.731
- I told you already. I
don't want your money.

236
00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:27.701
Working on a truck like this
is all the reward that I need.

237
00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:31.001
Besides. I'm startin' to
feel like you're an addict

238
00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:32.904
and I'm some sort of enabler.

239
00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:34.037
- 50/50.

240
00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:35.467
Split all racing wins.

241
00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.238
And that is my final offer

242
00:10:37.273 --> 00:10:38.404
and only because
you're my best friend.

243
00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:39.812
- Because I'm your best friend?

244
00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:41.715
- Mm hm.
- Okay. look. I'm on to you.

245
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.947
You're only offering me half

246
00:10:42.982 --> 00:10:45.015
because you want to race
twice as often. right?

247
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.885
Come on. tell me I'm right.

248
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.150
Come on.

249
00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:50.449
Huh?
- All right. fine. maybe.

250
00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:51.285
But is that a yes?

251
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.420
(Tommy laughs)

252
00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:59.425
(engine rumbling)
(mellow music)

253
00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:07.103
(mellow music continues)

254
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.215
What are you doing?

255
00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:26.287
- Thought I heard an owl.

256
00:11:26.322 --> 00:11:28.124
It's a bad omen
south of the border.

257
00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:34.229
Lechuza. they say she's a
shape-shifting witch looking

258
00:11:34.264 --> 00:11:36.462
for revenge on the
people who wronged her.

259
00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:39.938
- (laughs nervously) Funny.

260
00:11:39.973 --> 00:11:41.203
Okay. can we do this already?

261
00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:43.304
- Such a hurry.

262
00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:46.538
You want to have a
look around the place?

263
00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.177
- Somebody's got to
keep the world spinning.

264
00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:49.046
- Yeah.

265
00:11:50.082 --> 00:11:52.544
You know. some people would say

266
00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:56.218
you're wary of being
associated with me.

267
00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.320
- Hm. a black-market
medical supply dealer

268
00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:01.190
hiding out in the desert?

269
00:12:01.225 --> 00:12:03.896
What could I possibly
be afraid of?

270
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:06.063
Besides. you know I roll alone.

271
00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:08.098
- I do.

272
00:12:08.133 --> 00:12:09.968
A fiercely independent woman.

273
00:12:10.003 --> 00:12:10.902
- Fierce.

274
00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:12.564
Well. you try dealing
with a deadbeat ex

275
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.401
who splits as soon as
you get knocked up.

276
00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:16.469
and not getting a little fierce.

277
00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:18.878
- I guess some men just
aren't made for manhood.

278
00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:25.445
Here. look. a free
gift for the kid.

279
00:12:27.053 --> 00:12:29.889
Think of this as a reward
for all your business.

280
00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:37.358
- Uh. Shelby is a boy.

281
00:12:37.393 --> 00:12:38.491
He doesn't play with dolls.

282
00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:40.163
- Oh. boys can't
play with dolls?

283
00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.066
(Holly laughs)

284
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:43.562
- Look. this is a marionette.

285
00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:46.301
- No. that's a puppet. and a
particularly ugly one at that.

286
00:12:46.336 --> 00:12:48.204
- You know what? Just take it.

287
00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:52.076
- You really are the weirdest
outlaw in the world. Renzo.

288
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:54.309
- Yeah?
- You know that. right?

289
00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:55.948
- Okay. well. exactly
how many other outlaws

290
00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:57.081
are you acquainted with?

291
00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:59.017
- Hm. wouldn't you like to know?

292
00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:00.513
Thank you.

293
00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.994
(door creaking)

294
00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:12.030
(siren wailing faintly)

295
00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:15.264
(Agent Jackson sighs)

296
00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:18.102
(pensive music)

297
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.305
(glasses thudding)

298
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:32.314
(music continues)
(car alarm blaring)

299
00:13:41.358 --> 00:13:45.327
- Do I look okay (laughs)?
- Breathe.

300
00:13:45.362 --> 00:13:47.494
- [Woman Character] Oh.
he shot me (laughs).

301
00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:51.234
- Big cough.
- [Man Character] I think we

302
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:52.235
could work together here.
(Shelby coughing)

303
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.940
Okay?
(woman character chuckles)

304
00:13:53.975 --> 00:13:55.667
You know. my enemy's the
enemy kinda thing. right?

305
00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.240
What do you say?

306
00:13:57.275 --> 00:13:57.974
- [Woman Character]
Am I the only one

307
00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:00.507
that stays in my freakin' lane?

308
00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:02.509
- [Man Character] Yeah. see.
I know where they're goin'.

309
00:14:02.544 --> 00:14:05.281
(toilet flushes)

310
00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:14.158
(pensive music)

311
00:14:18.164 --> 00:14:20.230
(Agent Jackson sighs)

312
00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:23.266
(liquid splashing)

313
00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:27.600
- Lady. I gotta go.

314
00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:28.601
- Mm. uh uh.

315
00:14:30.242 --> 00:14:31.472
No. I want you to stay.

316
00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:35.113
Come on. yeah.

317
00:14:35.148 --> 00:14:36.312
Come on. stay.

318
00:14:37.183 --> 00:14:38.215
Come back.

319
00:14:39.284 --> 00:14:40.283
Come back and then...

320
00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:42.285
That's a good boy.

321
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.386
You stay right there.

322
00:14:46.225 --> 00:14:50.128
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

323
00:14:50.163 --> 00:14:50.997
Don't move.

324
00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:55.265
I just want you to stay and
talk to me for a little. 'kay?

325
00:14:59.172 --> 00:15:03.570
I just need you to
talk to me until

326
00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:06.111
the sun comes up and then...

327
00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.478
(Agent Jackson groans)

328
00:15:10.513 --> 00:15:13.283
I need you to. I need
you to distract me. okay?

329
00:15:13.318 --> 00:15:15.351
I just. uh. can you just be

330
00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:17.287
a little bit louder
than they are?

331
00:15:18.257 --> 00:15:20.356
Can you help me. be
just. uh. louder?

332
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:30.432
(upbeat rock music)

333
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.339
(music continues)
(engine revving)

334
00:15:46.351 --> 00:15:51.354
(music continues)
(revving continues)

335
00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.626
- I sent you to school. right?

336
00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:03.102
And when I sent you to school.

337
00:16:03.137 --> 00:16:05.236
they taught you how
numbers work. I assume?

338
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.303
- Oh. boy. here we go again.

339
00:16:06.338 --> 00:16:08.173
- So. what is higher?

340
00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:10.274
150. or 190?

341
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:12.441
Because right now. I'm kinda
hazy on the whole thing

342
00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:14.773
because I thought
this was a shakedown.

343
00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.478
I thought we were gonna
work our way up slowly

344
00:16:16.513 --> 00:16:18.612
on the speed and I thought
we had an agreement

345
00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:21.219
to keep our sponsor who's
been very good to us.

346
00:16:21.254 --> 00:16:23.155
happy by not blowin' up the bike

347
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.125
they pay us to build or turn
it into some shiny lawn dart

348
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.720
out there in the desert.

349
00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.557
- In order for it to
be a proper shakedown.

350
00:16:29.592 --> 00:16:32.098
you have to be willing
to shake things up.

351
00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:33.033
- She has a point.

352
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.102
- [Holly's Dad] Slow down. girl.

353
00:16:36.137 --> 00:16:36.762
- [Holly] Can't hear ya.

354
00:16:36.797 --> 00:16:38.335
- I said slow down.

355
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.369
- [Holly] I'm sorry. what?

356
00:16:39.404 --> 00:16:41.074
Can't. can't hear you.

357
00:16:41.109 --> 00:16:42.108
- Slow down.

358
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:46.079
(engine revving)

359
00:16:52.582 --> 00:16:53.482
That girl's got
the wind up her ass

360
00:16:53.517 --> 00:16:55.253
since the day she was born.

361
00:16:56.322 --> 00:16:57.354
- Yep.

362
00:16:58.588 --> 00:16:59.389
Yep.

363
00:16:59.424 --> 00:17:02.425
(anticipatory music)

364
00:17:08.697 --> 00:17:11.632
(music continues)

365
00:17:13.273 --> 00:17:14.635
- Hello. Miss?

366
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.274
Hey. excuse me.

367
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.573
Excuse me.

368
00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:20.113
Hello.

369
00:17:20.148 --> 00:17:21.312
Hey. excuse me.

370
00:17:22.645 --> 00:17:24.315
Excuse me.

371
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.118
Ma'am?

372
00:17:25.153 --> 00:17:26.284
Hello?

373
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.451
Hey. you just
can't walk in here.

374
00:17:28.486 --> 00:17:31.322
These planes are worth
billions of dollars.

375
00:17:31.357 --> 00:17:34.193
- Right. I wouldn't wanna
ruin a billionaire's day.

376
00:17:34.228 --> 00:17:36.360
especially the
local TV evangelist.

377
00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:38.758
- Can we discuss
this in my office?

378
00:17:38.793 --> 00:17:43.400
- Well. as far as I'm
concerned. this is your office.

379
00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:45.270
- Look. I don't know
who you think you are

380
00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:47.272
but you have no
jurisdiction in here.

381
00:17:47.307 --> 00:17:49.307
- Actually. I do.

382
00:17:49.342 --> 00:17:51.639
You see. you're regional.

383
00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:55.643
That means TSA and CPP.
they can't get in the way.

384
00:17:55.678 --> 00:17:58.283
(chuckles) It's funny.
I actually competed

385
00:17:58.318 --> 00:18:00.285
in farmyard teenage
beauty pageants

386
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.749
that had a tighter
managerial hierarchy

387
00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:05.554
than this glorified
desert lunchbox.

388
00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:06.357
- Screw you.

389
00:18:06.392 --> 00:18:07.457
I'm calling head office.

390
00:18:08.427 --> 00:18:09.723
- How 'bout this?

391
00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:12.198
I'm grounding everything
that's pointy.

392
00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:13.331
expensive and has two wings

393
00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:15.531
until I inspect
it front to back.

394
00:18:18.371 --> 00:18:19.403
- You're just mean.

395
00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.671
- If I were you. I'd get lost.

396
00:18:23.706 --> 00:18:24.837
That is. of course.
unless you would like

397
00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:26.410
to make things personal.

398
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:29.809
- Bitch.

399
00:18:29.844 --> 00:18:31.778
- (smirks) Atta boy.

400
00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:34.913
(anticipatory music)

401
00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.687
(music fades)

402
00:18:39.722 --> 00:18:42.723
(keypad beeps)

403
00:18:42.758 --> 00:18:44.923
- Shelby. we're ready for you.

404
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.629
(solemn music)

405
00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:51.864
- Hey. Carol. how you doin'?

406
00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:53.437
- I'm good. thanks.

407
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.439
Listen. we've got a-

408
00:18:55.474 --> 00:18:56.341
- I know.

409
00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:57.738
I'm behind on bills.

410
00:18:57.773 --> 00:18:59.509
- Way behind.

411
00:18:59.544 --> 00:19:02.380
Look. all you have to do is
pay something each month.

412
00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:03.579
Any amount. all right?

413
00:19:03.614 --> 00:19:05.482
Just to show us you're
making an effort.

414
00:19:05.517 --> 00:19:06.549
That's all.

415
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.881

- What's wrong?

446
00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:09.843
- [Renzo] It's that obvious?

447
00:20:11.484 --> 00:20:14.617
- Well. no gear and you look
like you've just seen a ghost.

448
00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:18.984
No. no. no. don't. don't
tell me there's no meds.

449
00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:21.327
- I saved what I could for ya.

450
00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:23.362
I know it's not that
much. just take it.

451
00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:27.465
Keep the money. keep the money.

452
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.499
Just take it.

453
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.504
- You're gonna get a new
supply in. though. right?

454
00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:34.802
- I don't know.

455
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.870
I don't know.

456
00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:38.674
All the local pilots are
freaking out right now.

457
00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:40.511
If I can't get
supplies to Vegas.

458
00:20:40.546 --> 00:20:43.679
I break this chain.
everything stops. all right?

459
00:20:43.714 --> 00:20:45.714
I'm telling you now so
you can make other plans.

460
00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:47.914
- (scoffs) other plans.

461
00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:49.388
What other plans?

462
00:20:50.688 --> 00:20:52.490
I can't afford legal meds.

463
00:20:52.525 --> 00:20:53.590
And you're my only hookup.

464
00:20:54.824 --> 00:20:58.991
- All right. just
give me one week.

465
00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:02.401
Stay in contact and I'll do my
best to figure something out.

466
00:21:06.374 --> 00:21:09.375
It's the timing that's
the problem here. okay?

467
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.607
There is a three-hour window

468
00:21:10.642 --> 00:21:11.674
to move everything
and that's it.

469
00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:12.675
The deal implodes.

470
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.878
Don't give up on me
just yet. all right?

471
00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:19.385
We'll figure it out.

472
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.882
(pensive music)

473
00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:30.660
(upbeat music)

474
00:21:30.695 --> 00:21:34.631
- That is a fuel pump rod
stuck in the block all right.

475
00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:37.667
(sighs) All right. great.

476
00:21:37.702 --> 00:21:39.537
- Oh. it wouldn't be
a proper job. Tommy.

477
00:21:39.572 --> 00:21:42.067
unless a two-minute job
turned into a two-hour job.

478
00:21:42.102 --> 00:21:43.442
- Mm hm.
(glasses clinking)

479
00:21:43.477 --> 00:21:44.674
- You can work it out?

480
00:21:44.709 --> 00:21:45.741
- Let's see.

481
00:21:46.944 --> 00:21:49.580
- At least we get to spend some
time together for once. huh?

482
00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:51.945
Because Shelby's been spendin'

483
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.079
a lotta time with
his grandma lately.

484
00:21:54.114 --> 00:21:57.016
- Yeah. I've been pullin'
a lot of overtime. Dad.

485
00:21:57.051 --> 00:21:58.589
I have to get these hours in.

486
00:21:58.624 --> 00:21:59.425
- And you will.

487
00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:02.725
I'm gonna get you into
the union if it kills me.

488
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.729
- Teamsters union has the
best medical packages.

489
00:22:06.764 --> 00:22:08.027
You got to compete. though.

490
00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:10.502
I mean. with the whole
gig economy and all that.

491
00:22:10.537 --> 00:22:12.405
- That's what
they're calling it.

492
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.506
Well. as long as it's
all legit. right?

493
00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:15.507
Nothing illegal?

494
00:22:16.873 --> 00:22:18.708
Because I wouldn't want you
two out on the street racin'

495
00:22:18.743 --> 00:22:21.073
for pinks or anything
stupid like that.

496
00:22:22.483 --> 00:22:26.782
- Yeah. um. because that
would be very stupid.

497
00:22:26.817 --> 00:22:28.619
- Super stupid.

498
00:22:28.654 --> 00:22:31.556
- But hey. you know. at
least we're not doing

499
00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:32.854
the old Silver
Trails 300 anymore

500
00:22:32.889 --> 00:22:34.757
'cause that was really sketchy.

501
00:22:36.728 --> 00:22:38.662
- What's the Silver Trails 300?

502
00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:39.762
- Don't ask. Dad.

503
00:22:43.603 --> 00:22:44.734
- Okay. then. I won't.

504
00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:47.537
I think we can probably pry

505
00:22:47.573 --> 00:22:49.442
this out with a
ring spanner. Tommy.

506
00:22:49.477 --> 00:22:52.203
It's an old trick I used to
use in big-box Chevelle's.

507
00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:53.512
- All right.

508
00:22:53.547 --> 00:22:54.513
- You know what a
ring spanner is?

509
00:22:54.548 --> 00:22:55.910
- (laughs) Yeah. I know
what a ring spanner is.

510
00:22:55.945 --> 00:22:56.845
- You have a ring spanner Tommy?

511
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.912
- Yes. I have a ring spanner.

512
00:22:57.947 --> 00:22:59.419
- Why don't ya go get it?

513
00:23:00.048 --> 00:23:00.882
Now.

514
00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:03.049
Thank you.

515
00:23:03.084 --> 00:23:06.492
(upbeat music playing)

516
00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:11.024
Hey. are you okay?

517
00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:12.498
- I'm good.

518
00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:15.226
No. I just figured
out what we needed.

519
00:23:15.261 --> 00:23:16.062
- [Holly's Dad] What?

520
00:23:16.097 --> 00:23:16.898
- More beer.

521
00:23:18.737 --> 00:23:19.835
- Now you're cookin'.

522
00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:22.673
- Pop.

523
00:23:22.708 --> 00:23:24.136
- That is why she's the
brains of the operation

524
00:23:24.171 --> 00:23:26.677
and you and I are not.

525
00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:28.943
(Holly laughs)

526
00:23:28.978 --> 00:23:31.209
(lid pops)
(air whooshing)

527
00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:33.585
(phone ringing)

528
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.653
(pensive music)

529
00:23:35.688 --> 00:23:36.819
- Go for Jackson.

530
00:23:36.854 --> 00:23:37.919
- Jackson. Connolly.

531
00:23:39.087 --> 00:23:40.526
Listen. I was just
calling to tell you.

532
00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:42.759
you're doing a great
job with the planes.

533
00:23:42.794 --> 00:23:44.057
Surveillance says
that the runners

534
00:23:44.092 --> 00:23:45.828
are refusing to move product.

535
00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:48.666
I'm impressed.

536
00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:50.129
- Listen. the smugglers
will be back up

537
00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:52.769
and running before you
know so don't you worry.

538
00:23:52.804 --> 00:23:54.771
- Yeah. about that. I just
got a call from up top

539
00:23:54.806 --> 00:23:58.544
and apparently we're being
a little too effective.

540
00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:01.679
We're interfering with our
friends' other operations.

541
00:24:01.714 --> 00:24:03.175
I'm gonna need you to slow down.

542
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.518
- Listen. I haven't even
gathered any evidence yet

543
00:24:05.553 --> 00:24:07.047
so I'll slow down once I
know this thing is shut down.

544
00:24:07.082 --> 00:24:09.720
- You'll slow down right
now like I just told you to.

545
00:24:09.755 --> 00:24:12.756
That is in order.
(boxes thudding)

546
00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:14.659
What the hell was that?

547
00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:15.286
- A box.

548
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:17.255
Um. a box just fell.

549
00:24:18.764 --> 00:24:20.192
Okay.

550
00:24:20.227 --> 00:24:22.568
I'll get the paperwork
gathered up for you then.

551
00:24:22.603 --> 00:24:23.228
- Good.

552
00:24:24.737 --> 00:24:25.934
You do good work.

553
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:27.903
You're an asset.

554
00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:33.139
(engine rumbling)

555
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.717
(anticipatory music)

556
00:24:47.595 --> 00:24:49.859
(window thuds)

557
00:24:49.894 --> 00:24:51.124
- Jeez. Renzo.

558
00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:52.631
You scared the hell out of me.

559
00:24:52.666 --> 00:24:54.666
- You're the one
showin' up unannounced.

560
00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:57.834
- Got any bourbon in there?

561
00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:00.034
After that I could
use a stiff drink.

562
00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:03.037
- You should probably
call before you visit.

563
00:25:03.072 --> 00:25:07.272
- Well. I'm sorry to intrude
but I have a proposal for you.

564
00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:12.849
About a year ago. we
were working on this set

565
00:25:12.884 --> 00:25:15.313
with some really shady
investors from Vegas.

566
00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:16.787
They would have us run
things back and forth

567
00:25:16.822 --> 00:25:18.118
from there overnight.

568
00:25:18.153 --> 00:25:20.120
People. packages.

569
00:25:20.155 --> 00:25:21.957
We never knew who or
what we were moving.

570
00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:23.794
We just knew not
to ask questions

571
00:25:23.829 --> 00:25:25.763
and not to get
stopped by the cops.

572
00:25:25.798 --> 00:25:27.028
We had this system going.

573
00:25:27.063 --> 00:25:28.931
It was called the
Silver Trails 300.

574
00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:31.835
You have Route 62.

575
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.706
we head east. swing up. 95.

576
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:36.939
all the way to Vegas.

577
00:25:37.975 --> 00:25:38.809
300 miles.

578
00:25:38.844 --> 00:25:40.239
- Okay.

579
00:25:40.274 --> 00:25:41.911
Five hour drive. give or take.

580
00:25:41.946 --> 00:25:43.913
- If you're playing
by the rules.

581
00:25:43.948 --> 00:25:45.948
yeah. it's about five hours.

582
00:25:45.983 --> 00:25:47.851
But what most people don't
know is there's a gap

583
00:25:47.886 --> 00:25:50.348
in the state police shift
change at the border.

584
00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:52.955
You time it right. run it like
you mean it the whole way.

585
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.254
average three
digits. no pit stops.

586
00:25:55.289 --> 00:25:56.695
you can make it in three hours

587
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.323
and the cops'll never
know you were there.

588
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.362
- You're suggesting you run
my contraband up the highway?

589
00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:05.803
- If it frees up this chain

590
00:26:05.838 --> 00:26:07.068
and keep things
moving. then yes.

591
00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:09.906
Unless you have a better idea?

592
00:26:09.941 --> 00:26:12.711
Because right now. it's my
little boy's life on the line.

593
00:26:12.746 --> 00:26:13.976
- I respect that. okay?

594
00:26:14.011 --> 00:26:16.847
But there is a massive
flaw in your plan.

595
00:26:16.882 --> 00:26:19.883
You wanna move a package.
a person in a sports car.

596
00:26:19.918 --> 00:26:21.313
that's easy. okay?

597
00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:23.414
But we're talking about a
weighty amount of product here.

598
00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:24.382
- Hm.

599
00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:25.757
Let me give you a tour.

600
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.258
650 horsepower to the wheels.

601
00:26:32.293 --> 00:26:33.996
Over 1.000 foot
pounds of torque.

602
00:26:36.363 --> 00:26:39.166
Fuel tanks take the
best of 50 gallons easy.

603
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:42.169
She'll run low elevens all day
long even in the midday heat.

604
00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:43.269
Oh. check this out.

605
00:26:46.373 --> 00:26:47.845
Load her up with five tons.

606
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.375
she'll just lay back.
cackle and pull even harder.

607
00:26:52.918 --> 00:26:55.182
- Well. she's anything
but inconspicuous.

608
00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:57.085
- Oh. I'm not done yet.

609
00:27:00.057 --> 00:27:02.255
I don't like getting any
attention I don't want.

610
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.962
On the streets. they
call her the Night Train.

611
00:27:07.163 --> 00:27:09.834
Personally. I like to
call her Black Bess.

612
00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:11.836
- Dick Turpin's horse?

613
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:13.970
- (chuckles) What can I say?

614
00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:14.905
I like my highwaymen.

615
00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:19.910
Look. I want my fuel covered

616
00:27:19.945 --> 00:27:22.242
and I want the meds I
normally receive for free.

617
00:27:22.277 --> 00:27:23.914
I'll get your
medication to Vegas

618
00:27:23.949 --> 00:27:25.949
and I will make planes
look slow in the process.

619
00:27:27.348 --> 00:27:29.447
- You're making it
really hard to say no.

620
00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:30.822
- Then give me a yes.

621
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.326
- Meet me on the access
road by the wind farm.

622
00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:41.833
(anticipatory music)

623
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:44.000
Keeps the sky clear
of any helicopters.

624
00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:44.935
Speak to no one.

625
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.937
My men'll know the drill.

626
00:27:46.972 --> 00:27:48.202
- [Holly] Will they be armed?

627
00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:49.973
- [Renzo] Assume
everyone you meet over

628
00:27:50.008 --> 00:27:51.777
the next 24 hours is armed.

629
00:27:52.978 --> 00:27:54.142
I wish I could go with you

630
00:27:54.177 --> 00:27:57.442
but Vegas has far
too many cameras.

631
00:27:57.477 --> 00:27:58.949
- [Holly] I think I'll be okay.

632
00:27:58.984 --> 00:28:01.050
I've done this a million times.

633
00:28:01.085 --> 00:28:03.019
- [Renzo] Not for
people like this.

634
00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:05.055
When you get to Vegas.

635
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.321
you head to the loading
dock at the Westgate Hotel.

636
00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:10.356
Our contact loves to
live the high life.

637
00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:13.491
Again. talk to nobody.

638
00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:14.998
You'll be given
the money in a bag.

639
00:28:15.033 --> 00:28:17.033
you take it and you
head straight home.

640
00:28:17.068 --> 00:28:19.464
(dramatic music)

641
00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:20.905
Be careful.

642
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.338
(music continues)
(train rattling)

643
00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.886
(music continues)

644
00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:44.764
(music continues)

645
00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:54.037
(mellow music)

646
00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:04.784
(music continues)

647
00:29:11.925 --> 00:29:14.552
(music continues)

648
00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:24.804
(music continues)

649
00:29:33.078 --> 00:29:36.112
(music continues)

650
00:29:37.247 --> 00:29:38.048
- Whoa!

651
00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:41.117
(music continues)

652
00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:54.064
(fist knocking)

653
00:29:56.167 --> 00:29:58.299
- Mr. Maxwell wants
to speak to you.

654
00:29:58.334 --> 00:29:59.432
- I have to get
back on the road.

655
00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:02.006
- It's nonnegotiable. honey.

656
00:30:03.141 --> 00:30:05.504
(mellow music)

657
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.856
(music continues)

658
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:22.224
(crowd chattering)

659
00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:23.621
(dice clattering)

660
00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:26.294
(all cheering)

661
00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:29.099
(Mr. Maxwell laughs)

662
00:30:29.134 --> 00:30:30.067
- Yes!

663
00:30:30.102 --> 00:30:32.201
- Somebody wanted to see me?

664
00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:34.907
(pensive music)

665
00:30:38.946 --> 00:30:41.210
(air whooshing)

666
00:30:41.245 --> 00:30:44.444
(gentle classical music)

667
00:30:48.681 --> 00:30:52.221
(Mr. Maxwell sighs)

668
00:30:52.256 --> 00:30:54.322
- I'm not a man who
likes to mince words.

669
00:30:55.523 --> 00:30:57.127
I like to tell it like it is.

670
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.429
I like country girls.

671
00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:06.136
Y'all are a different breed.

672
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:10.569
Women here. they're like
blowup dolls with a pulse.

673
00:31:12.276 --> 00:31:17.246
So. I was wondering if
you might wanna hang out.

674
00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:21.250
make a little extra.
have some fun?

675
00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:22.317
Hm?

676
00:31:24.255 --> 00:31:27.190
- (exhales) I'm
just here to drive.

677
00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:31.689
And I have a really long
night ahead of me. so I...

678
00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:34.494
- Can't blame a man
for asking. right?

679
00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:39.070
(Holly smirks softly)

680
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:43.206
By the way. I wanted to
give you this. a bonus.

681
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.144
We were in a tight
spot and I understand

682
00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:48.343
that you did the impossible.

683
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:51.511
Consider it a personal
thank you from me.

684
00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:57.550
I also wanna give
you my cell number

685
00:31:58.718 --> 00:32:00.289
in case you run
into any trouble.

686
00:32:02.326 --> 00:32:03.622
or if you change your mind.

687
00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:10.167
- Thank you.

688
00:32:10.202 --> 00:32:11.135
- Hm.

689
00:32:12.435 --> 00:32:15.535
- Wait. I'm sorry. I'm gonna
need you to repeat that.

690
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.009
- I said we just received word.

691
00:32:17.044 --> 00:32:18.505
another shipment
has reached Vegas.

692
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.738
- Well. I hate to
say I told you so.

693
00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:23.081
- Not as much as I hate
to hear you say it.

694
00:32:23.116 --> 00:32:25.083
You're back on. Jackson.

695
00:32:25.118 --> 00:32:26.579
- Yeesh. I'm pullin' on
so many U-turns here.

696
00:32:26.614 --> 00:32:29.186
I'm beginning to think that
I'm competing in NASCAR.

697
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:31.122
- We got a leak on
the receiving side.

698
00:32:31.157 --> 00:32:34.323
Apparently. the shipment
came in at night via train.

699
00:32:34.358 --> 00:32:35.753
- Via train?

700
00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:36.854
I'm not sure that adds up.

701
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:40.428
Well. looks like I'm goin'
on another wild goose chase.

702
00:32:40.463 --> 00:32:41.627
- Okay. then. you do that.

703
00:32:41.662 --> 00:32:43.200
and Jackson. lose the attitude.

704
00:32:43.235 --> 00:32:44.795
Things change when
the information does.

705
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.269
You should know that by now.

706
00:32:46.304 --> 00:32:47.567
- And you should try
to find someone else

707
00:32:47.602 --> 00:32:48.733
who's willing to run
around the desert

708
00:32:48.768 --> 00:32:50.174
doing your dirty work.

709
00:32:50.209 --> 00:32:51.274
Better yet. maybe
you should go after

710
00:32:51.309 --> 00:32:52.638
a big dog on your own turf

711
00:32:52.673 --> 00:32:54.607
rather than barking
at little ole me.

712
00:32:54.642 --> 00:32:55.608

00:41:38.671 --> 00:41:39.604
- I got it.

892
00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:40.869
- Okay. give it to me.
- This one's gonna kill.

893
00:41:40.904 --> 00:41:42.134
- (laughs) Okay.

894
00:41:42.169 --> 00:41:43.839
- Uh (chuckles). what
do you call a soldier

895
00:41:43.874 --> 00:41:45.973
who's been sprayed
by both mustard gas-

896
00:41:46.008 --> 00:41:47.612
- Wait.
- And pepper spray?

897
00:41:47.647 --> 00:41:48.910
- Stop. stop. stop. stop. I'm-

898
00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:50.879
- No. it's fine.
- No. I'm. I'm. I'm military.

899
00:41:50.914 --> 00:41:53.684
I'm. I'm ex-military.

900
00:41:54.885 --> 00:41:55.917
- You're a vet?

901
00:41:57.855 --> 00:41:59.624
- Sergeant First Class.

902
00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:00.724
- Oh.

903
00:42:00.759 --> 00:42:01.923
(Agent Jackson chuckles)

904
00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:04.057
Did. uh. did you see combat?

905
00:42:05.896 --> 00:42:08.358
(Agent Jackson groans)

906
00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.294
- Did I see combat?

907
00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:13.770
(Agent Jackson laughs)

908
00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:18.907
About 15 miles
outside of Baghdad.

909
00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:23.912
RPG flipped a Humvee in
front of us like a tin can.

910
00:42:23.947 --> 00:42:27.278
and then we lost half our squad.

911
00:42:27.313 --> 00:42:28.785
- [Man] Whew.

912
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.885
- Just like that.

913
00:42:32.153 --> 00:42:34.791
And we went toe to
toe with insurgents

914
00:42:34.826 --> 00:42:39.829
for an hour as we watched
our friends die in the dirt.

915
00:42:48.202 --> 00:42:50.367
That was a real bloodbath.

916
00:42:50.402 --> 00:42:53.942
(chuckles softly) You know?

917
00:42:53.977 --> 00:42:58.980
Like. the kind. um. people
win medals for surviving.

918
00:43:02.348 --> 00:43:07.351
But we didn't do any. we
didn't want any metals.

919
00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:11.025
We just wanted revenge.

920
00:43:14.734 --> 00:43:15.326
- Did you get it?

921
00:43:19.002 --> 00:43:21.002
(Agent Jackson's tongue clicks)

922
00:43:21.037 --> 00:43:22.234
- (sighs) I like your beard.

923
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.171
I really wanna touch your beard.

924
00:43:25.206 --> 00:43:28.746
- Here touch.
- I wanna touch your beard.

925
00:43:28.781 --> 00:43:31.210
(Agent Jackson moans)
(pensive music)

926
00:43:31.245 --> 00:43:33.784
Oh. God. that feels so good.

927
00:43:35.084 --> 00:43:37.986
(music continues)

928
00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:48.667
- Why you in the shop truck?

929
00:43:49.934 --> 00:43:52.935
- Oh. I needed something
my mom could climb into.

930
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.804
- Oh. wow.

931
00:43:54.774 --> 00:43:55.740
You look like hell.

932
00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:57.973
- Thanks. Tommy.

933
00:43:58.008 --> 00:43:59.107
(Tommy chuckles)

934
00:43:59.143 --> 00:44:01.812
I had like three energy drinks
and nothing's kickin' in.

935
00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:02.439
Is the coffee ready?

936
00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:03.341
- No. no.

937
00:44:05.147 --> 00:44:07.785
What you need is
some rest. though.

938
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.017
- [Holly] I'll be okay.

939
00:44:09.052 --> 00:44:09.886
- Uh huh.

940
00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:13.219
(Tommy grunts)

941
00:44:22.065 --> 00:44:24.901
(energetic music)

942
00:44:32.009 --> 00:44:35.043
(music continues)

943
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.856
(music continues)

944
00:44:52.392 --> 00:44:55.228
(music continues)

945
00:45:02.303 --> 00:45:05.205
(music continues)

946
00:45:12.984 --> 00:45:14.016
- Sorry.

947
00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:20.055
- Hey. hey!

948
00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.353
Hey. you were just
in my trailer.

949
00:45:23.357 --> 00:45:25.060
Wait a minute. I remember
why I saw you before.

950
00:45:25.095 --> 00:45:27.359
You're that redneck who was
driving that stupid truck.

951
00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:29.064
Hey. can somebody tell me

952
00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:31.198
why it is we have a
thief and a cheat on set?

953
00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:32.837
- Okay. your plastic surgeon
better be on speed dial

954
00:45:32.872 --> 00:45:34.069
because you don't get to
talk to my friends like that.

955
00:45:34.104 --> 00:45:35.906
- Hey. hey. hey.
hey. hey. calm down.

956
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:36.840
What the hell's going on?

957
00:45:36.876 --> 00:45:39.140
- Your girl over here
took over a grand

958
00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:41.406
from my trailer plus some
of my personal stuff.

959
00:45:41.441 --> 00:45:43.947
and this jackass was
just about to assault me.

960
00:45:45.049 --> 00:45:46.378
- Did you take anything of his?

961
00:45:48.855 --> 00:45:49.920
Wait here.

962
00:45:49.955 --> 00:45:53.022
(anticipatory music)

963
00:45:59.998 --> 00:46:02.933
(music continues)

964
00:46:08.072 --> 00:46:10.941
Your stuff wasn't
stolen. doofus.

965
00:46:10.976 --> 00:46:11.810
It was hidden.

966
00:46:13.374 --> 00:46:14.406
She was trying to protect you.

967
00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:18.344
- (scoffs) My personal items?

968
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.181
(Zack sniffs)

969
00:46:20.216 --> 00:46:22.018
- I don't know
anything about that.

970
00:46:22.053 --> 00:46:23.118
You know what?

971
00:46:23.153 --> 00:46:24.052
We're done here.

972
00:46:24.088 --> 00:46:25.516
We're finishing this
commercial without you.

973
00:46:25.551 --> 00:46:26.550
(Zack laughs)

974
00:46:26.585 --> 00:46:27.386
- You can't do that.

975
00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:28.618
- Watch me.

976
00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:29.553
I've been waiting for an excuse

977
00:46:29.588 --> 00:46:31.357
to fire your ass from day one.

978
00:46:32.525 --> 00:46:35.229
And hey. I bought
that jacket myself.

979
00:46:35.264 --> 00:46:36.329
- [Zack] That's mine.

980
00:46:38.036 --> 00:46:39.035
- [Tommy] Escort this jackass

981
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.103
and get him off the set please.

982
00:46:40.138 --> 00:46:42.500
- Hey. congrats on your
Pinto commercial. Spielberg.

983
00:46:42.535 --> 00:46:44.634
I hope it's a hit.

984
00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:47.505
(director sniffs)

985
00:46:50.081 --> 00:46:52.950
(mellow music)

986
00:46:57.616 --> 00:47:00.551
(music continues)

987
00:47:13.236 --> 00:47:16.072
(engine rumbling)

988
00:47:17.504 --> 00:47:20.274
(energetic music)

989
00:47:28.086 --> 00:47:30.922
(music continues)

990
00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:40.195
(music continues)

991
00:47:47.567 --> 00:47:49.204
- [Radio Operator]
Try to sneak one more

992
00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:51.470
and then let's see a little
more (speaking faintly).

993
00:47:51.505 --> 00:47:52.306
(radio beeps)

994
00:47:52.341 --> 00:47:55.177
(energetic music)

995
00:48:03.121 --> 00:48:05.957
(music continues)

996
00:48:12.295 --> 00:48:14.526
(alarm beeping)

997
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:19.498
(siren wailing)
(upbeat music)

998
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.476
(music continues)

999
00:48:33.745 --> 00:48:36.482
(engine revving)

1000
00:48:37.452 --> 00:48:40.288
(music continues)

1001
00:48:41.588 --> 00:48:44.424
(tires squealing)

1002
00:48:47.297 --> 00:48:49.330
(music continues)

1003
00:48:49.365 --> 00:48:52.036
(siren wailing continues)

1004
00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:54.137
(tires squealing)

1005
00:48:54.172 --> 00:48:57.008
(music continues)

1006
00:49:01.245 --> 00:49:03.707
(Holly exhales)

1007
00:49:05.282 --> 00:49:08.316
(music continues)

1008
00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:13.222
(indistinct radio chattering)

1009
00:49:13.257 --> 00:49:14.652
(radio beeps)

1010
00:49:14.687 --> 00:49:17.523
(music continues)

1011
00:49:28.668 --> 00:49:30.272
- [Man] Boss wants to see you.

1012
00:49:30.307 --> 00:49:33.374
(anticipatory music)

1013
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:44.517
(music continues)

1014
00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:53.658
(line trilling)

1015
00:49:57.565 --> 00:49:58.366
- [Shelby] Mom?

1016
00:49:58.401 --> 00:49:59.532
- Hey.

1017
00:49:59.567 --> 00:50:01.072
How you doin'?

1018
00:50:01.107 --> 00:50:02.403
- [Shelby] I was sleeping.

1019
00:50:03.439 --> 00:50:07.342
- I know. I just needed
to hear your voice.

1020
00:50:08.642 --> 00:50:10.279
- [Shelby] Where are you?

1021
00:50:10.314 --> 00:50:11.544
- I'll be home soon. bud.

1022
00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:14.580
I'll be home soon.

1023
00:50:14.615 --> 00:50:17.385
(mellow music)

1024
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:23.358
(dispatcher chattering faintly)

1025
00:50:27.562 --> 00:50:30.398
(music continues)

1026
00:50:36.406 --> 00:50:38.142
- [Agent Jackson] It's you.

1027
00:50:38.177 --> 00:50:38.769
- Thanks. buddy.

1028
00:50:38.804 --> 00:50:39.638
I owe you one.

1029
00:50:40.608 --> 00:50:41.673
(Agent Connolly sniffs)

1030
00:50:41.708 --> 00:50:43.345
(Agent Connolly exhales)

1031
00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.479
(Agent Jackson sniffs)

1032
00:50:45.514 --> 00:50:46.414
You on a stakeout?

1033
00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:49.153
You undercover?

1034
00:50:50.453 --> 00:50:52.321
Under the influence.

1035
00:50:53.324 --> 00:50:58.261
- You know. you're a
real piece of work.

1036
00:50:58.296 --> 00:50:59.462
(chuckles) Yeah.

1037
00:50:59.497 --> 00:51:04.630
You see. you got one person
working alone with no resources.

1038
00:51:05.732 --> 00:51:07.435
no leads that
actually go anywhere.

1039
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:12.110
And now (chuckles) I have to
search every pickup truck.

1040
00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:15.410
(Agent Jackson chuckles)

1041
00:51:15.445 --> 00:51:18.347
(sniffles) And boy. do we
love our pickup trucks.

1042
00:51:19.548 --> 00:51:24.551
(sighs) You are asking
me to do the impossible.

1043
00:51:25.752 --> 00:51:27.455
And to top it off (chuckles).

1044
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.425
you can't even decide
what that impossible

1045
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.690
thing is that you want.

1046
00:51:35.234 --> 00:51:37.531
- Well. that's a sob story.

1047
00:51:39.337 --> 00:51:44.340
- I just work and work and work.

1048
00:51:47.411 --> 00:51:49.477
I just can't lay down roots.

1049
00:51:49.512 --> 00:51:52.183
I can't make friends.
and for what?

1050
00:51:52.218 --> 00:51:54.746
(laughs) To help people?

1051
00:51:54.781 --> 00:51:58.519
The people that I want
to help can't be helped.

1052
00:51:58.554 --> 00:52:01.423
They're just a lost cause.

1053
00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:04.261
chronically
self-destructive (laughs).

1054
00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:07.462
- Hey. there's somethin'
you know about.

1055
00:52:09.532 --> 00:52:11.532
Self-destructive behavior.

1056
00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:13.534
I mean. look. I'm not
makin' fun of PTSD.

1057
00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:15.536
That's something serious.

1058
00:52:15.571 --> 00:52:18.473
Yeah. I know about
your little incident.

1059
00:52:18.508 --> 00:52:20.277
I read it in your
psych evaluation.

1060
00:52:21.478 --> 00:52:22.110
Ooph.

1061
00:52:23.348 --> 00:52:25.612
- You don't know what went down.

1062
00:52:26.747 --> 00:52:29.451
(sighs) We knew
that the insurgents

1063
00:52:29.486 --> 00:52:32.454
liked to pose as
civilians. okay?

1064
00:52:32.489 --> 00:52:33.488
We knew that.

1065
00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:35.754
You know?

1066
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:39.692
(sighs) We thought we
had good intelligence.

1067
00:52:39.727 --> 00:52:43.630
They told us not to
leave any witnesses.

1068
00:52:43.665 --> 00:52:45.731
They said. they said
that was an order.

1069
00:52:46.602 --> 00:52:47.766
- That's right.

1070
00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:50.373
It was in order. and
you follow your orders.

1071
00:52:50.408 --> 00:52:51.374
That's what you do.

1072
00:52:57.514 --> 00:52:59.448
You think you're the
only one who's figured

1073
00:52:59.483 --> 00:53:01.417
out their working
for the machine.

1074
00:53:04.752 --> 00:53:06.356
Yeah. I sleep fine at night.

1075
00:53:10.593 --> 00:53:11.625
- You don't have to look them

1076
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.627
in the eyes every
night like I do.

1077
00:53:13.662 --> 00:53:15.497
- Yeah. there it is.

1078
00:53:16.665 --> 00:53:17.697
That's my girl.

1079
00:53:18.964 --> 00:53:19.864
What is that. huh?

1080
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:24.440
Hm?

1081
00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:25.309
Guilt?

1082
00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:28.609
I don't see it that way.

1083
00:53:29.843 --> 00:53:31.876
I think you love it.
I think you need it.

1084
00:53:31.911 --> 00:53:33.548
I think you want
it because that's

1085
00:53:33.583 --> 00:53:35.979
the only feeling that you
even can feel anymore.

1086
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:39.983
Dead inside.

1087
00:53:40.018 --> 00:53:41.523
Oh. I can trust the guilt.

1088
00:53:44.561 --> 00:53:45.989
That's why you work for me.

1089
00:53:47.597 --> 00:53:49.333
And it ain't the paycheck.

1090
00:53:51.865 --> 00:53:55.867
(Agent Jackson laughs)

1091
00:53:55.902 --> 00:53:57.572
Or are you just scared?

1092
00:53:58.872 --> 00:54:01.642
'Cause I mean. who's gonna
want a washed up old vet?

1093
00:54:04.614 --> 00:54:05.910
I do.

1094
00:54:05.945 --> 00:54:06.779
I do.

1095
00:54:11.049 --> 00:54:13.522
(Agent Jackson exhales)

1096
00:54:13.557 --> 00:54:17.823
We're gonna have a nice long
relationship. me and you.

1097
00:54:25.404 --> 00:54:28.405
You know. town's.
uh. it's that way.

1098
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.806
(Agent Jackson's tongue clicks)

1099
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:36.611
(pensive music)

1100
00:54:44.115 --> 00:54:46.654
(tires squealing)

1101
00:54:46.689 --> 00:54:49.525
(music continues)

1102
00:54:53.663 --> 00:54:56.334
(phone ringing)

1103
00:54:59.966 --> 00:55:02.670
(Holly sighs)

1104
00:55:03.706 --> 00:55:05.739
- Look. I got your
letters. okay?

1105
00:55:05.774 --> 00:55:06.905
I'm working on it.

1106
00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.577
I will get you the
money as soon as I can.

1107
00:55:09.745 --> 00:55:10.909
I have to get back to work.

1108
00:55:15.718 --> 00:55:18.587
(phone ringing)

1109
00:55:19.887 --> 00:55:21.557
You'll get your money. okay?

1110
00:55:22.659 --> 00:55:25.627
- [Mr. Maxwell] Oh. I
don't want your money.

1111
00:55:26.696 --> 00:55:29.367
You know what I want from you.

1112
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:32.766
So. when are you gonna
pay me another visit?

1113
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:35.637
- How did you get my number?

1114
00:55:35.672 --> 00:55:39.135
- Oh. I have my fingers and
a lot of pies. Miss McCord.

1115
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:42.413
I hope I see you
again in Vegas soon.

1116
00:55:42.448 --> 00:55:45.713
I do so miss the
smell of the country.

1117
00:55:48.718 --> 00:55:53.050
(glass clinks)
(upbeat music)

1118
00:55:53.085 --> 00:55:55.756
(pensive music)

1119
00:56:04.536 --> 00:56:05.832
(Holly sighs)

1120
00:56:05.867 --> 00:56:08.703
(music continues)

1121
00:56:13.743 --> 00:56:14.577
- Mom?

1122
00:56:17.681 --> 00:56:18.944
Shelby?

1123
00:56:18.979 --> 00:56:20.715
- [Renzo] Taking care
of that nasty bear.

1124
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.013
- [Shelby] Yeah. you nasty bear.

1125
00:56:22.048 --> 00:56:24.719
- [Renzo] Wait. no.
he's not quite dead yet.

1126
00:56:24.754 --> 00:56:25.951
- [Shelby] Okay.

1127
00:56:25.986 --> 00:56:29.119
- Shelby. go check
on grandma. please.

1128
00:56:29.154 --> 00:56:32.463
(anticipatory music)

1129
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.194
- Hey.

1130
00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:39.734
- What are you doing here?

1131
00:56:40.704 --> 00:56:42.165
- I did the math and you're due

1132
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.705
to run out of
antibiotics today so-

1133
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.740
- So. call.

1134
00:56:45.775 --> 00:56:46.741
- (sighs) Come on.

1135
00:56:47.843 --> 00:56:49.106
I called.

1136
00:56:49.141 --> 00:56:50.481
You weren't picking up.

1137
00:56:51.176 --> 00:56:53.847
Look. he needs his medication.

1138
00:56:53.882 --> 00:56:55.046
So-

1139
00:56:55.081 --> 00:56:56.520
- So you just come
into my house?

1140
00:56:56.555 --> 00:56:57.653
- What do ya want me
to do. wait outside?

1141
00:56:58.590 --> 00:56:59.820
I'm a wanted man.

1142
00:56:59.855 --> 00:57:00.689
You know that.

1143
00:57:01.857 --> 00:57:02.988
- How did you even
know where I lived?

1144
00:57:04.563 --> 00:57:07.058
Oh. you had your boys
follow me home. didn't you?

1145
00:57:07.093 --> 00:57:09.962
- Have you taken any more
money from our mutual friend?

1146
00:57:09.997 --> 00:57:11.865
- Okay. listen. I
appreciate you stopping by

1147
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.231
and playing happy little
family with my son.

1148
00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:17.233
I've hitched my wagon
to wild horses before

1149
00:57:17.268 --> 00:57:19.939
and I've learned that
they always break free.

1150
00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:22.678
Please leave.

1151
00:57:22.713 --> 00:57:25.483
When there's business to
be done. I'll contact you.

1152
00:57:28.213 --> 00:57:29.817
- You know what?

1153
00:57:29.852 --> 00:57:31.984
Bad debts never take
care of good debts.

1154
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.792
Maybe it's you who's
the wild horse.

1155
00:57:43.294 --> 00:57:45.965
(pensive music)

1156
00:57:52.809 --> 00:57:54.072
- (grunts) There we go.

1157
00:57:54.107 --> 00:57:54.908
(Tommy's head thuds)

1158
00:57:54.943 --> 00:57:55.777
Ow. God!

1159
00:57:56.912 --> 00:57:57.746
Ah!

1160
00:57:58.947 --> 00:57:59.781
- Tough day?

1161
00:58:02.049 --> 00:58:03.213
- Is there any other kind?

1162
00:58:03.248 --> 00:58:04.082
- [Agent Jackson] Hm.

1163
00:58:05.052 --> 00:58:07.151
- What can I help you with?

1164
00:58:07.186 --> 00:58:10.726
- [Agent Jackson] You guys tune
diesel engines here. right?

1165
00:58:10.761 --> 00:58:11.793
- That we do.

1166
00:58:12.896 --> 00:58:16.325
We tune pretty much everything
except for pianos here.

1167
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.799
- Word on the street is you're

1168
00:58:17.834 --> 00:58:19.768
the hottest tuning
shop in the state.

1169
00:58:19.803 --> 00:58:22.606
- I don't know about
that but. yeah. we try.

1170
00:58:22.641 --> 00:58:23.266
- Huh.

1171
00:58:24.676 --> 00:58:25.939
Let me ask you a hypothetical.

1172
00:58:27.074 --> 00:58:29.745
Could you take a
truck that can carry.

1173
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:31.813
say. four. maybe
five tons and soup

1174
00:58:31.848 --> 00:58:34.178
that thing up so it
goes a 100 miles an hour

1175
00:58:34.213 --> 00:58:36.818
for three hours
without stopping?

1176
00:58:36.853 --> 00:58:37.951
Not even to refuel?

1177
00:58:39.185 --> 00:58:42.923
- That is a very
specific request.

1178
00:58:42.958 --> 00:58:47.961
Uh. but. yeah.
anything's possible.

1179
00:58:48.931 --> 00:58:50.898
Can I ask why?

1180
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:57.333
- Well. I'm just
asking questions.

1181
00:59:00.305 --> 00:59:01.777
Theorizing.

1182
00:59:01.812 --> 00:59:02.877
- [Tommy] Theorizing.

1183
00:59:02.912 --> 00:59:03.878
- Postulating.

1184
00:59:05.211 --> 00:59:06.914
You know how it is.

1185
00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:10.720
- Yeah.

1186
00:59:10.755 --> 00:59:12.150
I know exactly how it is.

1187
00:59:13.824 --> 00:59:18.959
(clicks tongue) Anyway. uh.
you are on private property.

1188
00:59:20.226 --> 00:59:24.261
Unless you want to arrest
me. you gonna arrest me?

1189
00:59:26.166 --> 00:59:27.396
No?

1190
00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:28.837
Okay. then I guess I
don't have to answer

1191
00:59:28.872 --> 00:59:30.806
anymore of your
dumb ass questions.

1192
00:59:31.974 --> 00:59:34.975
So. why don't you get
lost and come back

1193
00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:36.911
when you have some sort
of warrant or somethin'?

1194
00:59:36.946 --> 00:59:39.947
(music intensifies)

1195
00:59:42.347 --> 00:59:43.984
- [Agent Jackson] I'll
see myself out then.

1196
00:59:44.019 --> 00:59:46.954
(music continues)

1197
00:59:50.927 --> 00:59:53.862
- Look at my castle. Princess.

1198
00:59:53.897 --> 00:59:54.830
Case closed.

1199
00:59:54.865 --> 00:59:58.130
(dramatic music)

1200
00:59:58.165 --> 00:59:59.769
- Now remember what I said.

1201
00:59:59.804 --> 01:00:04.037
we're gonna start
off at 150. 1-5-0.

1202
01:00:04.072 --> 01:00:05.874
And we're gonna
bring the speed up

1203
01:00:05.909 --> 01:00:08.404
from there provided
she's steering on
your fingertips. okay?

1204
01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:09.911
Understand?

1205
01:00:09.946 --> 01:00:11.341
You can give me the stink
eye all you want. girl.

1206
01:00:11.376 --> 01:00:12.914
You know I'm right.

1207
01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:14.245
We start out slowly.

1208
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.786
We're going to finish
up much faster.

1209
01:00:17.723 --> 01:00:18.953
Well. look who showed up.

1210
01:00:20.759 --> 01:00:21.417
- I got a flat.

1211
01:00:22.992 --> 01:00:23.958
- You ride safe.

1212
01:00:23.993 --> 01:00:26.026
(engine revving)

1213
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:28.325
- When you have a
sec. we need to talk.

1214
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.700
It's about work.

1215
01:00:29.735 --> 01:00:34.705
(revving continues)
(upbeat music)

1216
01:00:41.813 --> 01:00:46.816
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1217
01:00:57.026 --> 01:00:58.795
- [Holly's Dad] Come
on girl. slow down.

1218
01:00:58.830 --> 01:00:59.422
Slow down.

1219
01:01:01.932 --> 01:01:02.798
Wait.

1220
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:07.771
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1221
01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:17.242
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

1222
01:01:17.277 --> 01:01:18.276
Go. go. go. go!

1223

That was easy.

Cuts and bruises.

1275
01:03:17.903 --> 01:03:19.166
You crash your bike
at 200 miles an hour

1276
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:21.036
and you walk away
with cuts and bruises.

1277
01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:23.170
I don't know how
you do it. kiddo.

1278
01:03:23.205 --> 01:03:25.106
- Does that mean I'm discharged?

1279
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:26.371

run a few checks.

have one in there

after your little tumble.

1284
01:03:37.384 --> 01:03:41.958
So. you and me. we need
to have a conversation.

1285
01:03:45.062 --> 01:03:48.932
The bike's a mess. but you can
bang metal back into shape.

1286
01:03:48.967 --> 01:03:52.067
People (sighs). not so much.

1287
01:03:53.235 --> 01:03:56.137
I was thinking. remember
your first go-cart?

1288
01:03:57.107 --> 01:03:58.337
- Dad. not this story again.

1289
01:03:58.372 --> 01:04:01.945
- (laughs) You were
eight years old.

1290
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.342
We spent months
building that thing

1291
01:04:03.377 --> 01:04:05.146
and on the day that we finished.

1292
01:04:05.181 --> 01:04:07.214
you take it to the
steepest hill in town.

1293
01:04:07.249 --> 01:04:09.183
- The steepest
hill in the suburb.

1294
01:04:09.218 --> 01:04:10.283
You always exaggerate.

1295
01:04:10.318 --> 01:04:11.515
- It was the
steepest hill in town

1296
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.089
and you proceed to crash
it into a tree trying

1297
01:04:14.124 --> 01:04:17.521
to prove to some kid that
you were the fastest.

1298
01:04:17.556 --> 01:04:19.358
- He was a bully.

1299
01:04:19.393 --> 01:04:21.624
His fat ass needed to
be taught a lesson.

1300
01:04:21.659 --> 01:04:24.165
And remember. I crossed
the finish line first.

1301
01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:29.368
And maybe if someone
had put a shoot on.

1302
01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:30.941
I would've slowed down.

1303
01:04:30.976 --> 01:04:33.240
- Oh. so that was my fault.

1304
01:04:33.275 --> 01:04:34.109
I'm sorry.

1305
01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.179
- I'm not a kid anymore. Pop.

1306
01:04:40.183 --> 01:04:41.677
- No. I know you're not.

1307
01:04:44.055 --> 01:04:45.516
But you're still
the same person.

1308
01:04:47.058 --> 01:04:47.958
Nothing's changing that.

1309
01:04:47.993 --> 01:04:49.190
Nothing should change that

1310
01:04:49.225 --> 01:04:52.996
because age takes
the edge off of ya.

1311
01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:56.967
Makes you less curious.
less. I don't know.

1312
01:04:58.267 --> 01:05:00.168
I guess it keeps ya from
doing stupid stuff. I guess.

1313
01:05:00.203 --> 01:05:04.172
but I kinda forgot who you are.

1314
01:05:05.373 --> 01:05:08.737
Tryin' to be a protective
parent and all that.

1315
01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:11.311
I forgot that you
are my daughter.

1316
01:05:12.677 --> 01:05:13.478
You're born to run.

1317
01:05:13.513 --> 01:05:14.380
It's in your blood.

1318
01:05:15.515 --> 01:05:18.186
And I just want
you to know. Holly.

1319
01:05:19.189 --> 01:05:21.090
I'm not standing in
your way any longer.

1320
01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:23.686
You didn't crash and burn today

1321
01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:24.787
because you pushed it too hard.

1322
01:05:24.822 --> 01:05:28.526
You crashed because the
world can't keep up with you.

1323
01:05:29.727 --> 01:05:31.331
And that's the way it should be.

1324
01:05:33.104 --> 01:05:34.499
That's how we make a difference.

1325
01:05:36.074 --> 01:05:39.042
That's what makes
some of us pioneers.

1326
01:05:39.077 --> 01:05:41.407
and some of us just
sticks in the mud.

1327
01:05:46.711 --> 01:05:48.447
- You have no idea how
much it means to me

1328
01:05:48.482 --> 01:05:49.348
to hear you say that.

1329
01:05:51.749 --> 01:05:54.420
- Believe me. I do
because I have fallen

1330
01:05:54.455 --> 01:05:57.192
into that trap of slowing
down way too much myself.

1418
01:11:20.649 --> 01:11:23.518
- [Renzo] They say she's a
shape-shifting witch looking

1419
01:11:23.553 --> 01:11:25.982
for revenge on the
people who wronged her.

1420
01:11:26.017 --> 01:11:28.853
- [Agent Jackson] The only
reason I'm not arresting you

1421
01:11:28.888 --> 01:11:30.657
is because in the
grand scheme of things.

1422
01:11:30.692 --> 01:11:33.528
you're worth diddly squat
in the case like this.

1423
01:11:33.563 --> 01:11:36.498
- [Mr. Maxwell] So. when are
you gonna pay me another visit?

1424
01:11:36.533 --> 01:11:38.698
- [Renzo] Nothing in
life comes for free.

1425
01:11:38.733 --> 01:11:41.063
Every favor comes with a debt.

1426
01:11:41.098 --> 01:11:43.835
Every criminal act.
subject to karma.

1427
01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:47.003
- [Holly's Dad] You're born
to run. it's in your blood.

1428
01:11:48.413 --> 01:11:50.743
I'm not standing in
your way any longer.

1429
01:11:50.778 --> 01:11:52.778
- Shelby. get your meds!

1430
01:11:52.813 --> 01:11:55.011
(energetic music)

1431
01:11:55.046 --> 01:11:55.880
Shelby. come on.

1432
01:11:58.621 --> 01:11:59.389
Get in.

1433
01:11:59.424 --> 01:12:00.654
Go.

1434
01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:05.428
Put your seatbelt on.

1435
01:12:05.463 --> 01:12:06.891
Seatbelt on?
- Uh. almost.

1436
01:12:06.926 --> 01:12:07.892
- Put it on.

1437
01:12:07.927 --> 01:12:10.730
(music continues)

1438
01:12:17.574 --> 01:12:20.102
(music continues)

1439
01:12:31.489 --> 01:12:34.556
(Holly's Dad grunts)

1440
01:12:35.493 --> 01:12:37.691
(door slams)

1441
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:40.463
- You look like
you're in a hurry

1442
01:12:40.498 --> 01:12:42.762
to get somewhere
you don't wanna go.

1443
01:12:42.797 --> 01:12:45.798
- Yeah. we need to
wait for awhile.

1444
01:12:47.571 --> 01:12:48.801
- What did you do?

1445
01:12:48.836 --> 01:12:49.736
- The right thing.

1446
01:12:51.069 --> 01:12:54.070
- (sighs) Now you're
paying for it.

1447
01:12:57.779 --> 01:12:59.911
- Dad. I need to know
Mom's gonna be okay.

1448
01:12:59.946 --> 01:13:01.814
- (scoffs) You just
run and leave me

1449
01:13:01.849 --> 01:13:04.113
with a pretty tough job.
don't ya think. Hol?

1450
01:13:05.556 --> 01:13:06.786
Does this mean you and the boy

1451
01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:09.184
are gonna be spending
more time together?

1452
01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.692
- Yeah.

1453
01:13:11.727 --> 01:13:13.760
- But you'll be
just fine. Holly.

1454
01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:17.764
- I don't know if I need
to go right or left.

1455
01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:18.963
forwards or backwards.

1456
01:13:18.998 --> 01:13:22.901
but this isn't workin'
for me here. Dad.

1457
01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:25.442
- It's not working for
a lot of people. Holly.

1458
01:13:26.775 --> 01:13:31.778
(sighs) Listen. kiddo.
you gave it your best shot

1459
01:13:33.144 --> 01:13:34.847
and I'm sorry it's all
uphill for your generation.

1460
01:13:34.882 --> 01:13:37.113
But you do whatever
you need to do

1461
01:13:37.148 --> 01:13:39.115
to even out the
playing field. hear me?

1462
01:13:42.857 --> 01:13:46.859
- I guess we'll
(sniffs) keep in touch.

1463
01:13:46.894 --> 01:13:47.728
- Okay.

1464
01:13:49.765 --> 01:13:53.030
You know. I told
myself I came here

1465
01:13:54.869 --> 01:13:57.837
for some spare parts
but I really think
I came here looking.

1466
01:13:57.872 --> 01:13:58.772
I really think I
came you're looking

1467
01:13:58.807 --> 01:14:00.037
for the man I used to be. Hol.

1468
01:14:02.877 --> 01:14:04.547
And I'd rather lose
you for six months

1469
01:14:04.582 --> 01:14:05.779
then have you lose
your edge forever

1470
01:14:05.814 --> 01:14:07.011
because the last thing I want

1471
01:14:07.046 --> 01:14:08.815
is my little girl slowing down.

1472
01:14:12.216 --> 01:14:14.722
- I'm gonna go faster
than you've ever seen.

1473
01:14:16.792 --> 01:14:19.694
- And I'm gonna be
cheering for you.

1474
01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:23.225
(sniffs) For both of you.

1475
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.799
(Holly's Dad sighs)

1476
01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:28.967
(sniffs) You know. Hol.

1477
01:14:30.267 --> 01:14:33.202
ditch the 'burb soon as you can.

1478
01:14:33.237 --> 01:14:34.610
It just don't suit you.

1479
01:14:36.746 --> 01:14:37.547
- Deal.

1480
01:14:37.582 --> 01:14:40.044
(solemn music)

1481
01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:47.821
(engine rumbling)

1482
01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:50.527
(pensive music)

1483
01:14:57.767 --> 01:15:00.801
(music continues)

1484
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:15.750
- Hey.

1485
01:15:15.785 --> 01:15:16.617
I'm gonna ask you something

1486
01:15:16.653 --> 01:15:17.686
and you have to be
straight with me.

1487
01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:18.280
- Always.

1488
01:15:18.315 --> 01:15:19.919
What?

1489
01:15:19.954 --> 01:15:21.349
- If I can't keep running
meds. what happens?

1490
01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.824
- As long as there's
demand. the vacuum fills.

1491
01:15:23.859 --> 01:15:25.694
If not by me than somebody else.

1492
01:15:26.928 --> 01:15:28.763
Do you wanna quit? Is this
because of what I did?

1493
01:15:28.798 --> 01:15:29.995
Because I'm sorry.

1494
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.227
Listen. I know I
crossed the line-

1495
01:15:31.262 --> 01:15:33.064
- No. Renzo. this has
nothing to do with you.

1496
01:15:33.099 --> 01:15:35.803
I kept taking the money and
now the feds are on to me.

1497
01:15:38.203 --> 01:15:40.038
- So. you're leavin'?

1498
01:15:40.073 --> 01:15:42.304
- Yeah. we're headed
straight for the border.

1499
01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.614
Do you know if you can-

1500
01:15:44.649 --> 01:15:45.945
- Get you meds in Mexico?

1501
01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:46.946
Yeah.

1502
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:48.014
Look. I can make
sure Shelby gets

1503
01:15:48.049 --> 01:15:50.851
the best healthcare he's
ever had in his life. okay?

1504
01:15:50.886 --> 01:15:52.149
But there's no way you
get through a checkpoint

1505
01:15:52.184 --> 01:15:53.755
if you're on a wanted list.

1506
01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:55.889
Wait right there.

1507
01:15:58.927 --> 01:15:59.761
- Good. bud?

1508
01:16:03.899 --> 01:16:05.932
No. no. no. Renzo. I can't.
I don't know how to use it.

1509
01:16:05.967 --> 01:16:08.671
- I know. I know. you don't
have to. I'm going with you.

1510
01:16:08.706 --> 01:16:10.970
I can show you a way through
and I can protect you.

1511
01:16:11.005 --> 01:16:13.170
- You don't have to do this
after what I said to you.

1512
01:16:13.205 --> 01:16:15.876
- Truth be told I'd have
done this the day I met you.

1513
01:16:16.945 --> 01:16:17.911
All right? Let's go.

1514
01:16:21.851 --> 01:16:23.719
- Hey. you were right.

1515
01:16:24.722 --> 01:16:26.282
I am the wild horse.

1516
01:16:26.317 --> 01:16:27.855
- I know.

1517
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.351
(door slams)

1518
01:16:29.386 --> 01:16:31.353
(engine rumbling)

1519
01:16:31.388 --> 01:16:32.860
- Seatbelt on?
- Yeah.

1520
01:16:32.895 --> 01:16:35.995
(anticipatory music)

1521
01:16:44.038 --> 01:16:46.874
(music continues)

1522
01:16:53.377 --> 01:16:57.918
(phone ringing)
(music continues)

1523
01:16:57.953 --> 01:16:59.052
- Connolly.

1524
01:16:59.088 --> 01:17:02.659
- You are not going to believe
who I'm tailing right now.

1525
01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:05.354
Renzo Romeo.

1526
01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.427
- You're on Renzo
Romeo right now?

1527
01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:14.231
- (sighs) He's on a
nice little road trip

1528
01:17:14.266 --> 01:17:15.463
with almost no protection.

1529
01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:16.937
I mean. do you have
any idea how long

1530
01:17:16.972 --> 01:17:18.070
I've been searching for
this guy and then boom.

1531
01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:19.368
like that. he's in my lap?
- Yeah. okay.

1532
01:17:19.403 --> 01:17:20.842
Hey. keep tabs on him.

1533
01:17:20.877 --> 01:17:21.469
I'm gonna make a phone-

1534
01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:22.712
- Tabs on him?

1535
01:17:22.747 --> 01:17:23.944
No. I've got a team ready to go

1536
01:17:23.979 --> 01:17:26.012
if these guys even think
of heading to Vegas.

1537
01:17:26.047 --> 01:17:27.277
- Jackson. listen to me.

1538
01:17:27.312 --> 01:17:29.048
you are not to lay a
hand on Renzo Romeo

1539
01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.313
until I give you the all clear.

1540
01:17:30.348 --> 01:17:32.150
Is that understood? I
have to make a phone call.

1541
01:17:32.185 --> 01:17:33.888
There are politics involved.

1542
01:17:33.923 --> 01:17:36.022
- Oh my God. I am so sick of
hearing about the politics.

1543
01:17:36.057 --> 01:17:37.023
Just let me do my job.

1544
01:17:37.058 --> 01:17:38.959
- And you let me do mine!

1545
01:17:38.994 --> 01:17:41.192
You listen to what
I tell you to do.

1546
01:17:41.227 --> 01:17:43.062
You follow my orders. you grunt!

1547
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:51.103
- Tommy?

1548
01:17:52.106 --> 01:17:53.204
- [Tommy] Over here.

1549
01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:56.405
(solemn music)

1550
01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.274
- Tommy?

1551
01:18:00.213 --> 01:18:01.751
What happened?

1552
01:18:01.786 --> 01:18:04.083
Shelby. please. go
look at the bikes.

1553
01:18:04.118 --> 01:18:05.513
Are you okay?

1554
01:18:05.548 --> 01:18:06.921
Wow.

1555
01:18:06.956 --> 01:18:07.988
- We haven't met yet.

1556
01:18:09.387 --> 01:18:10.188
- Renzo.

1557
01:18:10.223 --> 01:18:11.453
- [Tommy] Renzo.

1558
01:18:11.488 --> 01:18:13.895
- Tommy. we have to get
you to the hospital.

1559
01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:15.897
Who did this?

1560
01:18:15.932 --> 01:18:17.261
- Some heavies.

1561
01:18:17.296 --> 01:18:18.768
Showed up asking about you.

1562
01:18:20.233 --> 01:18:22.035
They said they wanna
send a message.

1563
01:18:23.467 --> 01:18:26.138
Needless to say I might've had
something to say about that.

1564
01:18:28.505 --> 01:18:30.780
- You're the best guard dog
a girl could ever ask for.

1565
01:18:30.815 --> 01:18:32.540
You know that?

1566
01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:34.278
- Those were Maxwell's men.

1567
01:18:34.313 --> 01:18:36.951
Looks like you got two
bounties on your head now.

1568
01:18:38.284 --> 01:18:39.921
- I'm under the impression

1569
01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:41.516
that you might be in a
spot of trouble (coughs).

1570
01:18:43.289 --> 01:18:45.058
- You could say that.

1571
01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:49.964
I think we're gonna lay
low in Mexico for awhile.

1572
01:18:49.999 --> 01:18:51.130
- Oh. yeah?

1573
01:18:51.165 --> 01:18:54.100
I'll have to come visit
once I feel better

1574
01:18:54.135 --> 01:18:56.498
'cause I think you owe me a
truck load of tacos and beans.

1575
01:18:56.533 --> 01:18:58.038
(Holly laughs)

1576
01:18:58.073 --> 01:18:59.072
Ow.

1577
01:18:59.107 --> 01:19:00.139
Yes. please.

1578
01:19:01.076 --> 01:19:03.010
- If they were here
looking for you.

1579
01:19:03.045 --> 01:19:05.848
why did they feel the
need to leave so fast?

1580
01:19:05.883 --> 01:19:09.115
(tires squealing)

1581
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:10.215
- I have to go.

1582
01:19:11.086 --> 01:19:12.118
- Then go.

1583
01:19:13.319 --> 01:19:16.254
- I love you.

1584
01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:17.992
- I love you.

1585
01:19:18.027 --> 01:19:19.191
- [Holly] Come on.

1586
01:19:19.226 --> 01:19:20.291
- I love you.

1587
01:19:21.492 --> 01:19:23.195
- I'm waiting.

1588
01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:25.362
We literally have
them surrounded.

1589
01:19:25.397 --> 01:19:26.429
- You're good to go.

1590
01:19:27.432 --> 01:19:29.036
Light 'em up if you have to.

1591
01:19:30.138 --> 01:19:31.203
- There's a kid in there.

1592
01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.172
- Mm hm.

1593
01:19:35.176 --> 01:19:37.044
How terrible.

1594
01:19:37.079 --> 01:19:39.915
(dramatic music)

1595
01:19:42.051 --> 01:19:44.480
(door bangs)

1596
01:19:56.593 --> 01:20:01.596
(horn honking)
(tires squealing)

1597
01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:05.138
- Night Train. bitch (laughs).

1598
01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.107
- Secure the area.

1599
01:20:07.142 --> 01:20:08.141
I'm on them.

1600
01:20:08.176 --> 01:20:11.210
(dramatic music)

1601
01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:20.252
(music continues)

1602
01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:30.526
- [Holly] Hang on. Shelby. okay?

1603
01:20:30.561 --> 01:20:31.560
Hang onto something.

1604
01:20:31.595 --> 01:20:34.431
(music continues)

1605
01:20:41.979 --> 01:20:42.912
- Okay.

1606
01:20:42.947 --> 01:20:45.607
Please. tell me that
was intentional. yeah?

1607
01:20:45.642 --> 01:20:48.478
(music continues)

1608
01:20:57.522 --> 01:21:00.325
(music continues)

1609
01:21:04.232 --> 01:21:06.199
(Agent Jackson grunts)

1610
01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:07.662
- Sorry. Officer.

1611
01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:09.136
Foot came off the brake.

1612
01:21:13.142 --> 01:21:13.943
- Thanks. Dad.

1613
01:21:16.343 --> 01:21:21.247
(engine revving)
(energetic music)

1614
01:21:28.421 --> 01:21:31.257
(music continues)

1615
01:21:33.393 --> 01:21:34.491
What the hell is that?

1616
01:21:37.001 --> 01:21:37.560
- It's Maxwell's men.

1617
01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:38.462
Go. go.

1618
01:21:39.696 --> 01:21:41.531
- Shelby. get down on
the floorboard. okay?

1619
01:21:41.566 --> 01:21:43.170
I need you to stay down.

1620
01:21:43.205 --> 01:21:44.468
You gotta stay on the
floorboard. all right?

1621
01:21:44.503 --> 01:21:48.307
(engines revving)
(music continues)

1622
01:21:48.342 --> 01:21:50.210
- He'll kill us out here.

1623
01:21:50.245 --> 01:21:51.079
Come on.

1624
01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:55.182
You okay. kid?

1625
01:21:55.217 --> 01:21:56.414
Stay down.

1626
01:21:56.449 --> 01:22:01.254
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1627
01:22:08.329 --> 01:22:09.195
- Hold on. Shelby.

1628
01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:14.201
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1629
01:22:19.505 --> 01:22:24.508
(revving continues)
(revving continues)

1630
01:22:28.679 --> 01:22:33.682
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1631
01:22:39.756 --> 01:22:44.759
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1632
01:22:48.732 --> 01:22:50.039
I can't outrun that.

1633
01:22:50.074 --> 01:22:51.535
I can't out run it.

1634
01:22:52.439 --> 01:22:53.735
(gun cocks)

1635
01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:55.011
- Keep it steady.

1636
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.345
- Shelby. stay down. okay?

1637
01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:03.745
(revving continues)
(music continues)

1638
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.352
(shots firing)

1639
01:23:09.126 --> 01:23:11.621
(engine revving)

1640
01:23:14.362 --> 01:23:15.295
You okay?

1641
01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:16.263
Are you okay?

1642
01:23:16.298 --> 01:23:18.364
(pensive music)

1643
01:23:18.399 --> 01:23:23.402
(Holly panting)
(Renzo panting)

1644
01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:32.510
Well. you did say you'd
get us to the border.

1645
01:23:33.711 --> 01:23:35.447
- I'm not stopping
there. all right?

1646
01:23:35.482 --> 01:23:36.481
I'm comin' with you.

1647
01:23:37.649 --> 01:23:40.254
- You wanna hitch
your wagon to this?

1648
01:23:40.289 --> 01:23:41.816
- If you'll let me. yeah.

1649
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:47.393
- Well. prepare for your life
to get a whole lot wilder.

1650
01:23:48.297 --> 01:23:50.528
- (sniffs) I can handle that.

1651
01:23:52.433 --> 01:23:54.796
(pensive music)

1652
01:23:54.831 --> 01:23:56.237
- Oh. that's bad.

1653
01:23:56.272 --> 01:23:59.108
(music continues)

1654
01:24:07.349 --> 01:24:10.383
(music continues)

1655
01:24:17.392 --> 01:24:20.360
(music continues)

1656
01:24:27.336 --> 01:24:30.436
(music continues)

1657
01:24:45.486 --> 01:24:50.489
- Seems. uh. seems you
underestimated me. huh?

1658
01:24:52.493 --> 01:24:55.890
You see. I've been
staking out this rat hole

1659
01:24:55.925 --> 01:24:59.531
for over a year in
the hopes that maybe.

1660
01:25:00.732 --> 01:25:03.601
maybe one day this
guy would pop up.

1661
01:25:03.636 --> 01:25:06.736
(smirks) Look at you two.

1662
01:25:06.771 --> 01:25:10.212
It's wild how things
come together. ain't it?

1663
01:25:10.247 --> 01:25:11.345
- It is.

1664
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.907
Why don't you keep
that gun on me. huh?

1665
01:25:12.942 --> 01:25:14.612
- Not a problem. Renzo.

1666
01:25:14.647 --> 01:25:19.584
Oh. let's be honest. you're
not much of a threat. are you?

1667
01:25:20.653 --> 01:25:22.224
- Try me.

1668
01:25:22.259 --> 01:25:23.588
- I read every
report we have on you

1669
01:25:23.623 --> 01:25:26.426
and you've never actually
had the guts to kill anyone.

1670
01:25:28.397 --> 01:25:32.366
- And yet here I am. top
of your most wanted list.

1671
01:25:33.864 --> 01:25:35.534
- Yep. here you are.

1672
01:25:35.569 --> 01:25:38.933
You're a smuggler. okay?

1673
01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:41.606
You wanna kill gang
bangers. have at it.

1674
01:25:41.641 --> 01:25:43.641
You'd be doing me a favor.

1675
01:25:43.676 --> 01:25:45.511
You start messing with
the economy. though.

1676
01:25:45.546 --> 01:25:46.479
we got a problem.

1677
01:25:47.348 --> 01:25:48.778
- Listen. I'll come
with you right now

1678
01:25:48.813 --> 01:25:50.846
and they walk. all right?

1679
01:25:50.881 --> 01:25:52.617
- You care about
their safety now?

1680
01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.554
Is that right?

1681
01:25:58.592 --> 01:25:59.492
How about this?

1682
01:26:01.463 --> 01:26:02.891
You don't do
contracts. I get it.

1683
01:26:04.862 --> 01:26:07.401
But you and I. we can
still make a deal.

1684
01:26:07.436 --> 01:26:08.864
You testify that this guy forced

1685
01:26:08.899 --> 01:26:10.569
you into this and
I give you my word

1686
01:26:10.604 --> 01:26:13.506
you will be looked after.
new identity. house.

1687
01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:16.245
everything the kid
needs. all taken care of.

1688
01:26:18.579 --> 01:26:19.611
What do ya say?

1689
01:26:24.816 --> 01:26:26.420
- I can do better than that.

1690
01:26:27.753 --> 01:26:28.818
- [Agent Jackson] Oh. yeah?

1691
01:26:30.327 --> 01:26:32.426
- You know. I've been thinking.

1692
01:26:32.461 --> 01:26:35.495
you and I. we're kinda the same.

1693
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.598
You're tired. too. right?

1694
01:26:39.633 --> 01:26:41.468
Because I'm exhausted.

1695
01:26:43.439 --> 01:26:45.373
We're both running
as hard as we can.

1696
01:26:47.344 --> 01:26:49.938
The only difference
is that I'm running

1697
01:26:49.973 --> 01:26:50.872
towards something good.

1698
01:26:52.481 --> 01:26:53.447
and I get the feeling
that you're running

1699
01:26:53.482 --> 01:26:54.481
away from something bad.

1700
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.620
- (sniffles) Wow.

1701
01:27:02.557 --> 01:27:04.623
All right. you got me there.

1702
01:27:06.594 --> 01:27:08.363
- I can give you a bigger fish.

1703
01:27:09.465 --> 01:27:11.696
somebody that's
actually worth chasing.

1704
01:27:12.798 --> 01:27:15.502
And you said it
yourself. I'm a nobody.

1705
01:27:16.703 --> 01:27:19.638
I'm diddly squat in
this case. remember?

1706
01:27:20.839 --> 01:27:22.509
And you mean to tell
me that you signed up

1707
01:27:22.544 --> 01:27:24.005
for this job so
that you could chase

1708
01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.007
somebody smuggling
medical supplies?

1709
01:27:27.043 --> 01:27:27.877
- Wow.

1710
01:27:29.485 --> 01:27:32.046
(exhales) That is a hell
of a lot of psychoanalyzing

1711
01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.487
you got goin' on there.

1712
01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:38.921
Who are you offering?

1713
01:27:41.794 --> 01:27:42.628
- Stay here.

1714
01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:49.437
Maxwell.

1715
01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:50.306
- Mm.

1716
01:27:51.639 --> 01:27:52.671
Interesting.

1717
01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.103
What ya got for me?

1718
01:27:56.138 --> 01:27:57.271
- Are you gonna let us pass?

1719
01:27:57.306 --> 01:28:00.646
- Maybe. it's hard to say
without seeing the goods first.

1720
01:28:01.979 --> 01:28:03.946
- I want something from you.

1721
01:28:03.981 --> 01:28:05.684
- [Agent Jackson] Hm.

1722
01:28:05.719 --> 01:28:07.884
- I wanna know what it is
that you're running from.

1723
01:28:07.919 --> 01:28:12.922
- (laughs) Did this just
become a therapy session?

1724
01:28:13.793 --> 01:28:14.392
Is that what's happening?

1725
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:17.531
- Do you want Maxwell or not?

1726
01:28:17.566 --> 01:28:19.962
(pensive music)

1727
01:28:31.877 --> 01:28:34.746
- (sighs) I executed
a family in cold blood

1728
01:28:34.781 --> 01:28:36.316
and I'm not proud of it.

1729
01:28:40.182 --> 01:28:42.919
(sniffs) They told
me I had to do it

1730
01:28:42.954 --> 01:28:44.690
because they messed up.

1731
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:49.057
They had bad intelligence.

1732
01:28:50.764 --> 01:28:53.028
So. an innocent family
had to die at my hands

1733
01:28:53.063 --> 01:28:58.066
and I get to look at them
every time I close my eyes.

1734
01:29:07.649 --> 01:29:10.177
(Agent Jackson sniffs)

1735
01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:11.915
Oh. damn it!

1736
01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:16.392
There ya go.

1737
01:29:17.021 --> 01:29:18.020
You happy now?

1738
01:29:23.632 --> 01:29:26.666
- This is my son. Shelby.

1739
01:29:29.165 --> 01:29:30.406
He's my everything.

1740
01:29:32.168 --> 01:29:34.641
And by laws of science.
he shouldn't exist.

1741
01:29:35.842 --> 01:29:36.643
But here he is.

1742
01:29:38.746 --> 01:29:39.712
Nobody can explain it to me

1743
01:29:39.747 --> 01:29:42.880
but I have my own little theory.

1744
01:29:44.686 --> 01:29:48.655
I think that when something
innocent is killed.

1745
01:29:49.856 --> 01:29:51.757
something pure takes its place.

1746
01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:56.223
And it might help you
to see it that way. too.

1747
01:29:56.258 --> 01:29:58.665
(soft music)

1748
01:30:04.838 --> 01:30:08.004
(Agent Jackson gasps)

1749
01:30:12.681 --> 01:30:14.549
Oh. damn.

1750
01:30:14.584 --> 01:30:16.144
(Agent Jackson exhales)

1751
01:30:16.179 --> 01:30:18.916
This is (sniffs). this is
pretty embarrassing (sniffs).

1752
01:30:21.954 --> 01:30:24.625
(Agent Jackson groans)

1753
01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:25.791
I sure hope whatever you have

1754
01:30:25.826 --> 01:30:27.826
on Mr. Maxwell is worthwhile.

1755
01:30:31.095 --> 01:30:34.569
- I've been going through
people's trash my whole life.

1756
01:30:34.604 --> 01:30:37.770
So. trust me when I say I
know where to find dirt.

1757
01:30:38.806 --> 01:30:41.642
(music continues)

1758
01:30:44.141 --> 01:30:47.780
(Agent Jackson panting)

1759
01:30:49.553 --> 01:30:52.180
(music continues)

1760
01:30:56.593 --> 01:30:57.526
You did good. girl.

1761
01:30:59.827 --> 01:31:00.760
You did damn good.

1762
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.225
Come on. bud.

1763
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:10.869
Hey.

1764
01:31:13.808 --> 01:31:14.840
Give him hell.

1765
01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:17.513

I kinda planned to cross
the border with ya.

slow things down a little.

1788
01:33:04.721 --> 01:33:06.886
