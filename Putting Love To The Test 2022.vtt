00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:13.290
Over 600 teams competed
in this year's entrepreneurship

4
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.813
challenge last weekend.

5
00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:17.729
I want to congratulate
everyone who participated.

6
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.601
You represented Faraday so well.

7
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:22.560
And for that. I'm
giving you all a medal.

8
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:32.048
I do. however. want
to congratulate

9
00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.268
two students who
came in second place

10
00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:36.618
with their new business idea.

11
00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:39.403
Dylan and Ariella. your
matchmaking website

12
00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:41.405
really impressed the judges.

13
00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.060
And you made this economics
teacher and the entire student

14
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.235
body really proud.

15
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.715
Congratulations. guys.

16
00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:49.892
Whoo!

17
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:59.249
Oh. don't forget you have a quiz
tomorrow on trade agreements.

18
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.250
Bye.

19
00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:05.995
Ms. Harris.

20
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.084
Thank you.

21
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.391
We were wondering if we
could ask you something.

22
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:11.479
Sure.

23
00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.567
It's kind of personal.

24
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.962
Are you dating anyone?

25
00:02:17.093 --> 00:02:18.312
The reason we ask
is because we've

26
00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:19.791
decided to take our
winning business plan

27
00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.706
and turn it into a real
matchmaking business.

28
00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:23.055
- Really?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:24.666
We found an angel
investor. my dad.

30
00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.015
and we're doing it for real.

31
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.799
But we need some actual people.

32
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.713
Single people.

33
00:02:28.844 --> 00:02:30.193
Right.

34
00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:32.630
Single people like you
to beta test it for us.

35
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.110
Why do you assume
that I'm single?

36
00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:38.680
Wait. wait.

37
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.638
You're really starting
a business with the plan

38
00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.465
you created from my class?

39
00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:42.858
Yeah.

40
00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:44.251
And with our entire
budget going to R&D.

41
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:45.556
we didn't have anything
left for marketing.

42
00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:47.167
Exactly.
So it's kind of word of mouth.

43
00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:49.952
At least. right now.

44
00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.432
- So you want to match me?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.260
Well. I mean. technically
the algorithm we created

46
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.565
will be doing the matching.

47
00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.001
All you have to do
is create a profile.

48
00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:57.307
Please.

49
00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.266
We have 43 men and
only 7 women so far.

50
00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:02.486
And almost no one
over 18 or under 60.

51
00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:06.751
I'll think about it. OK?

52
00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:07.665
Thank you.

53
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:08.579
Thank you so much.

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.798
And don't worry.

55
00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:11.278
With our matchmaking
platform. you're

56
00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:13.280
sure to find the man of
your dreams in no time.

57
00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:21.679
Good to know.

58
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.160
I think you should
let them match you.

59
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.814
What's the worst
that could happen?

60
00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:27.946
Tammy. I am done
with dating sites.

61
00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:29.470
I've been doing that
for the last two years

62
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.559
and all I have to show
is a string of bad dates.

63
00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.735
But you don't know
anyone in Santa Barbara.

64
00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:36.346
It would be a really
great way to meet people.

65
00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:37.782
I know you.

66
00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:38.740
Um. I'm flattered.

67
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.263
But I'm taken.

68
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:41.569
Can't your husband
just introduced me

69
00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.092
to some of his single friends?

70
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.921
Oh. and by the way.
you're not my type.

71
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:46.835
What?

72
00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:47.879
Wait. why?

73
00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:54.451
Jamie.

74
00:03:54.582 --> 00:03:57.062
Jamie. focus on
your follow-through.

75
00:03:57.193 --> 00:03:59.543
Come on.

76
00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.545
Here.

77
00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:02.894
Elbow high.

78
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:03.895
All right?

79
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.640
All right. let's
work on some laps.

80
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:10.685
Bring it in.

81
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:18.475
I suppose I could create
a profile. just to show

82
00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:20.912
Dylan and Ariella my support.

83
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:22.740
Well. they did come
up with the entire thing

84
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.439
based on your assignment.

85
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.397
I'm proud of them for
starting their own business.

86
00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:28.268
They're good kids.

87
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:30.922
Mhm.

88
00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:32.446
What's the worst that
could happen. right?

89
00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:34.491
Exactly.

90
00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.101
Your yearbook
office is in there.

91
00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:37.407
Thanks.

92
00:04:37.538 --> 00:04:38.669
Principal Stall says
he wants me to get

93
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.496
it done today because
we're printing

94
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:40.715
out yearbooks tomorrow.

95
00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:42.717
So how do I look?

96
00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:43.848
Picture perfect.

97
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:44.936
Have fun.

98
00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:49.332
You got to slow
down your swing

99
00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:50.725
if you want to lob the ball.

100
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:52.335
Here's what happens
if you swing too fast.

101
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.125
Ow!

102
00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:01.039
Oh.

103
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.738
Yikes.

104
00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:05.479
I'm so sorry.

105
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:07.742
Why didn't you yell incoming
or heads up or something?

106
00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:09.309
I didn't see you.

107
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.222
You OK?

108
00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:11.267
Yeah.

109
00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:13.008
I'm fine. but my shirt isn't.

110
00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:13.922
Here.

111
00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:14.966
No. don't rub it.

112
00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:15.967
You're gonna make it worse.

113
00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:17.491
What is this. dirt?

114
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:18.666
Yeah.

115
00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:20.145
From the court.

116
00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:21.364
Don't worry though.

117
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:22.583
It'll come out with
a little bleach.

118
00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:23.975
Bleach?

119
00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:25.325
I can't bleach this blouse.

120
00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:26.848
It's silk.

121
00:05:26.978 --> 00:05:28.328
Great.

122
00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:29.720
I'm supposed to take a
picture in five minutes.

123
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.027
I have a t-shirt in my
locker you could put on.

124
00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:33.289
A t-shirt?

125
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.160
It's clean.

126
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.467
Pretty clean.

127
00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:38.990
I think I washed it.

128
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:40.688
It might be a little big
on you. but at least--

129
00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:42.037
It's fine.

130
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:44.953
I'll just wear my
own clothes that fit.

131
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.433
Is that better?

132
00:05:50.262 --> 00:05:53.135
There's one little
spot where-- to the--

133
00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:55.093
more to the left.

134
00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:56.747
Your left.

135
00:05:56.878 --> 00:05:57.618
Do you mind?

136
00:05:57.748 --> 00:05:58.619
Please.

137
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.145
There.

138
00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:04.712
Never even happened.

139
00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:06.453
Ms. Harris. did you
get hit with our ball?

140
00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:07.715
Yes. but I'm fine.

141
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.412
Oh. good.

142
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:11.109
Hey. did you make a
decision yet about filling out

143
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.329
that profile page?

144
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.810
Against my better
judgment. I'll do it.

145
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.724
Send me the link.

146
00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:17.899
You rock. Ms. Harris.

147
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.900
I'll see you in class.

148
00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.034
Cool.

149
00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:24.558
In class?

150
00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:25.907
She a sub or something?

151
00:06:26.037 --> 00:06:26.864
Yeah. Ms. Harris
is a new econ teacher

152
00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:28.126
that replaced Ms. Salinger.

153
00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:29.737
And she's way better.

154
00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:30.781
Hm.

155
00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:43.881
Bottom cabinet?

156
00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:46.144
Oh. mom. I can do that after
I finish these lesson plans.

157
00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:48.756
Why don't you come
sit down and relax?

158
00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.192
Liz. I'm the one who
convinced you to move

159
00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:51.541
back here and buy this place.

160
00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:53.325
The least I could
do is help you out.

161
00:06:53.456 --> 00:06:56.938
And besides. it's been
like this for five weeks.

162
00:06:57.068 --> 00:06:59.941
I haven't had the time with
everything going on at school.

163
00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:02.552
I'm sure it is hard picking up
where another teacher left off.

164
00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:04.902
Yeah. especially when that
teacher only had five lesson

165
00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.252
plans for the whole semester.

166
00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:09.472
Liz. you've always
gone over and above.

167
00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:11.518
sometimes to your detriment.

168
00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:14.259
You know. not everything
you do has to be perfect.

169
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.742
Well. if it can
be. why not. right?

170
00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:19.917
Wait.

171
00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:21.702
Is this mine?

172
00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:23.617
Yes. you left it at Christmas.

173
00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:24.661
OK.

174
00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:26.054
Well. that's one mystery solved.

175
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:28.622
Oh. that reminds me.

176
00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:30.667
Do you want to check
that box over there?

177
00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:36.238
Awe.

178
00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:37.239
Are these for me?

179
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:38.980
Yes.

180
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.156
Think of it as my contribution
to your successful business.

181
00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:42.462
Thank you.

182
00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.202
You didn't have to
do that. sweetie.

183
00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:46.291
Well. I'm proud of you. mom.
for launching this new venture.

184
00:07:46.422 --> 00:07:47.771
You've been wanting
to do it for so long.

185
00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:49.730
I remember you talking
about it when I was a kid.

186
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.600
Did I?

187
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:51.906
Yes.

188
00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:53.690
It was around the
time when dad left.

189
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:56.606
And you baked cookies for
the bake sale at church.

190
00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:59.522
That lady wanted to buy six
dozen for her grandson's party.

191
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:00.480
You sold them to her.

192
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.656
That's right.

193
00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:07.095
You know. I am so glad that
you decided to come back.

194
00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:08.531
I know you love Philly.

195
00:08:08.662 --> 00:08:11.969
But I am excited to see
you every single day

196
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.755
now that you're back
in Santa Barbara.

197
00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:16.234
OK. just kidding.

198
00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:17.845
Every other weekend?

199
00:08:17.975 --> 00:08:18.976
I can handle that.

200
00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:20.021
OK.

201
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:32.468
The profile had
100 questions on it?

202
00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:33.382
How long did that take?

203
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.775
Two hours.

204
00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.560
Now I know how they feel
on their final exam.

205
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:38.996
Liz. did you see
the maple fritter?

206
00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:40.607
I did.

207
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:41.738
Thanks for the email asking
what my favorite was.

208
00:08:41.869 --> 00:08:43.131
That's so thoughtful of you.

209
00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:44.959
Anything to make
you feel welcome here.

210
00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:47.570
And congrats on the
entrepreneurship win.

211
00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:50.007
I haven't seen the students
this excited about economics

212
00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.487
class in a long time.

213
00:08:57.362 --> 00:08:58.799
Maple fritter.

214
00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:00.714
Have you had one?

215
00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:01.758
No.

216
00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:02.629
You should.

217
00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:03.760
They're phenomenal.

218
00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:12.726
That's Ted.

219
00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:14.989
Ted. I saved you a seat.

220
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.773
Thanks. Gina.

221
00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:17.774
But I've already got one.

222
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:33.094
So that takes care
of yearbook committee.

223
00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:35.662
So next up is our
end-of-the-year event.

224
00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:37.751
Carnival Day. where
we invite the whole

225
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:39.840
community to
celebrate our students

226
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.276
and their accomplishments.

227
00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:43.626
Now. this is gonna to
take place next month.

228
00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:45.454
the weekend before
school lets out.

229
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.805
So I will need two of
you to organize it.

230
00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:52.548
Any volunteers?

231
00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:55.246
I know this one
is a lot of work.

232
00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:58.989
but it is a great way
to send off the seniors.

233
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.819
Hey. do you wanna do it?

234
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.733
No.

235
00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:06.083
It'll be fun.

236
00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:07.694
Gina.

237
00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:11.262
Uh. I've already organized
three events this year.

238
00:10:11.393 --> 00:10:13.438
Well. you've definitely
done your fair share.

239
00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:14.744
Anyone else?

240
00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:23.057
I could do it.

241
00:10:23.187 --> 00:10:24.362
Thank you. Liz.

242
00:10:24.493 --> 00:10:26.060
Does anyone else
want to help Liz?

243
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.930
Ted.

244
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:28.584
Hm?

245
00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:32.632
You haven't organized
anything this year or last year.

246
00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:34.329
Yeah.

247
00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:37.114
I mean. I'd love to. but I'm
super busy with this tennis

248
00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:37.941
tournament coming up.

249
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:38.899
OK.

250
00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:41.510
Anyone else?

251
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.381
I think you really dodged
a bullet on that one.

252
00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.999
You know what. I will do it.

253
00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:54.784
This is gonna be the best
circus day we've ever had.

254
00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:56.830
Carnival day.

255
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.179
Same thing.

256
00:10:58.309 --> 00:11:00.050
Oh. I think Tammy
was about to volunteer.

257
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.748
Weren't you. Tammy?

258
00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:03.445
You're always saying how you
want to organize something.

259
00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:04.620
I-- I can't.

260
00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:05.752
I'm already doing graduation.

261
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:06.666
Sorry.

262
00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:07.710
OK.

263
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:11.540
Then I guess it's Liz and Ted.

264
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.629
Thanks. guys.

265
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.240
All right. let's talk about
the final exam schedule.

266
00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:23.117
There you are.

267
00:11:23.247 --> 00:11:24.945
You rushed out of the meeting
like the building was on fire.

268
00:11:25.075 --> 00:11:26.860
Yeah. I had a lot to do.

269
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.078
Have you ever
planned one of these

270
00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:29.950
before at your old school?

271
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.864
Where was that?

272
00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:32.343
Philadelphia.

273
00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:33.823
And no. I've never planned
one of these before.

274
00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:34.868
Have you?

275
00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:36.130
No.

276
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.348
It's a carnival.

277
00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:39.524
Fun rides. dunk
tanks. food carts.

278
00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:41.918
What could possibly go wrong?

279
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:45.226
I can think of
many. many things.

280
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:47.924
So when do you
want to get together?

281
00:11:48.055 --> 00:11:49.752
I'm free seventh period Monday.

282
00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:51.406
Sure.
Yeah.

283
00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:53.147
That gives me enough time
to look through this binder

284
00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:55.192
and see what vendors
we've used in the past.

285
00:11:55.323 --> 00:11:56.280
Where did that come from?

286
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.413
The resource room.

287
00:11:58.543 --> 00:12:02.243
There's a binder for every
event that the school has had.

288
00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:04.071
We're gonna need to
create one for our event

289
00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:05.637
when we're done with it.

290
00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:06.943
You knew that. right?

291
00:12:07.074 --> 00:12:08.292
Yeah. of course.

292
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.039
Have a good weekend.

293
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.997
She hates me.

294
00:12:34.884 --> 00:12:38.322
Oh. a new message from Greg.

295
00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:39.584
OK.

296
00:12:39.715 --> 00:12:40.760
"Hi.

297
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.457
I read your profile.
and I'd love

298
00:12:42.587 --> 00:12:44.415
to get the conversation going."

299
00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:46.766
OK.

300
00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:47.679
5'11".

301
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.811
Never married.

302
00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:49.812
Once a company.

303
00:12:49.943 --> 00:12:50.813
Not bad.

304
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:54.556
Another one?

305
00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:57.211
Uh. Oren.

306
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:58.081
Pete now?

307
00:12:58.212 --> 00:12:59.082
OK. OK.

308
00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:00.475
Slow down.

309
00:13:00.605 --> 00:13:01.563
Where did Greg go?

310
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:17.405
Hey. mom.

311
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:18.536
Hi. honey.

312
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.060
Listen. real quick.

313
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.062
Your father said he's
headed to your place.

314
00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:25.674
Make sure he doesn't
see the surprise.

315
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:26.893
Thanks. mom.

316
00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:27.545
Thanks. honey.

317
00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:28.416
I'm on it.

318
00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:49.132
Hey. Pops.

319
00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.873
What brings you over?

320
00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:52.483
I told your mom I was
stopping by to say hi.

321
00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:54.355
but I really came
to bring you this.

322
00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:56.270
What's this?

323
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.662
Nice.

324
00:13:57.793 --> 00:13:58.750
Where did you find
all these old photos?

325
00:13:58.881 --> 00:13:59.926
In the basement.

326
00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:01.710
As a surprise for
our anniversary

327
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:02.842
next month. I thought maybe you
could put them on the computer.

328
00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:04.408
Sure.
I can scan these for you.

329
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:05.279
She'll like that.

330
00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:06.758
Thanks.

331
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:07.803
By the way. how's the
tennis team this year?

332
00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:08.935
Best I've had.

333
00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:09.979
Both boys and girls.

334
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.676
Glad to hear it.

335
00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:13.548
With you as their coach. I
wouldn't expect anything else.

336
00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:14.766
I appreciate that. dad.

337
00:14:14.897 --> 00:14:15.724
All right. don't
tell your mom.

338
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.292
I won't tell her.

339
00:14:18.422 --> 00:14:19.249
Have a good night.

340
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.250
See ya.

341
00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:30.565
So what brought
you to Santa Barbara?

342
00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:32.872
Well. I taught at a public
school in Philadelphia

343
00:14:33.002 --> 00:14:34.917
for six years.

344
00:14:35.048 --> 00:14:36.919
And I literally just
moved back this month.

345
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.833
That's great.

346
00:14:37.964 --> 00:14:38.703
Welcome back.

347
00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:40.009
Thanks.

348
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.315
How about you?

349
00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:43.099
Your profile said
you owned a company.

350
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.492
but it didn't say for what.

351
00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:48.235
I'm sorry.

352
00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:50.106
I'm just noticing how
healthy your hair looks.

353
00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:51.586
Oh. thanks.

354
00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:52.587
I grew it myself.

355
00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:55.677
- Hm.
- What?

356
00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:56.591
That's what I thought.

357
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.766
It's a little dry.

358
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.289
Excuse me?

359
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.771
Have you tried a sea-sea
cream with jojoba oil?

360
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.992
I don't know what that is.

361
00:15:06.122 --> 00:15:08.733
You are in luck because
I know everything about it.

when you get a subscription.

369
00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:26.795
Will that be cash or card?

370
00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:33.584
Oh.

371
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:36.152
Oh. he's definitely
good looking.

372
00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:37.849
Wait. is this the
one that was trying

373
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.070
to sell you hair care products?

374
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:42.680
I mean. it must be really
hard to try to find

375
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:44.726
people to listen to his pitch.

376
00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:46.902
At least he bought you cake.

377
00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:51.907
And I deserved every bite
of that chocolate cake.

378
00:15:52.038 --> 00:15:54.388
What am I gonna tell the kids?

379
00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:56.259
Just tell them you
weren't feeling it.

380
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.000
Besides. you have two other
matches on there. right?

381
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.698
One of those guys will pan out.

382
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:03.353
I'm just not sure if I
want to mix my personal life

383
00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:05.138
with my professional life.

384
00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:07.836
Liz. what personal life?

385
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.881
Look. if it doesn't work
out. Dylan and Ariella

386
00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:10.926
graduate soon anyway.

387
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:11.796
Forget about Greg.

388
00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:12.841
Show me the next guy.

389
00:16:16.758 --> 00:16:17.541
Oh.

390
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:18.629
Oh. he's cute.

391
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.500
Yeah.

392
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.110
Hi. guys.

393
00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:21.981
Hi.

394
00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:22.894
Hi.

395
00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:24.635
Sorry to interrupt.

396
00:16:24.766 --> 00:16:26.811
I just wanted to see if you
need any help with Carnival day.

397
00:16:26.942 --> 00:16:29.466
Uh. not yet.

398
00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:30.990
I haven't had the
chance to meet up

399
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.079
with Ted to talk
about a plan. but we

400
00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:34.645
are meeting up this afternoon.

401
00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:35.995
Where?

402
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.431
I don't know.

403
00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:39.737
Well. Ted has my number
saved in his cell phone.

404
00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:44.612
So if you guys need anything
at all. just shoot me a text.

405
00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:47.136
Bye.

406
00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:48.833
Did she just make
it a point to tell

407
00:16:48.964 --> 00:16:51.749
me that he has her number?

408
00:16:53.099 --> 00:16:54.317
Gina's had a thing
for Ted since he

409
00:16:54.448 --> 00:16:56.102
started here two years ago.

410
00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:59.409
She probably thinks
you're competition.

411
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.498
That is the one thing Gina
does not need to worry about.

412
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:02.543
Mhm.

413
00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:12.596
Hey. Dylan.

414
00:17:12.727 --> 00:17:13.989
What's up?

415
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.817
I was wondering if
you'd do me a favor.

416
00:17:15.947 --> 00:17:17.993
As long as it doesn't
involve buying a candy bar.

417
00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:19.603
No.

418
00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:21.388
See. Ariella and I started
this matchmaking website.

419
00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:24.173
and we were kind of hoping
that we could get you--

420
00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:25.435
Oh no.

421
00:17:25.566 --> 00:17:26.741
I've heard about
this little business

422
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.438
endeavor you all got going on.

423
00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.832
And my romantic life is private.

424
00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:32.573
And it's gonna stay that way.

425
00:17:32.703 --> 00:17:34.836
You know. a lot of the other
teachers have already joined.

426
00:17:34.966 --> 00:17:36.490
They want to help
Ariella and I realize

427
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.971
our lifelong dreams of becoming
successful entrepreneurs.

428
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:41.016
Please?

429
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.282
OK.

430
00:17:46.413 --> 00:17:47.936
I'll do it.

431
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.243
But only because I'm your
favorite teacher. and I know

432
00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:51.679
you'll work that into
your next conversation

433
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:52.897
with principal Stall.

434
00:17:53.028 --> 00:17:53.768
Deal?

435
00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:55.291
Deal.

436
00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:56.423
Help me get some
of these balls.

437
00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:57.337
Yeah.

438
00:17:57.467 --> 00:18:00.340
So $250 for everything.

439
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.211
Does that include the
balloon and the darts?

440
00:18:02.342 --> 00:18:03.560
Great.

441
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:06.389
And do the booths
already come assembled?

442
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.956
Terrific.

443
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.132
Thank you.

444
00:18:10.263 --> 00:18:13.092
Hey. I was just getting
prices for the game rentals.

445
00:18:13.222 --> 00:18:15.224
Are you sure we should
let the kids throw darts?

446
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:17.096
I've seen most of
them throw a baseball.

447
00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:18.662
there's nothing good
that can come from that.

448
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:22.405
OK.

449
00:18:25.278 --> 00:18:27.454
So do you want the good
news or the bad news?

450
00:18:27.584 --> 00:18:28.759
Positive vibes only.

451
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.021
The good news is
that all the booths

452
00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:31.110
are available for our date.

453
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:31.980
Perfect.

454
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.721
Our job is done.

455
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:35.201
Where are you going?

456
00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:37.420
To get a taco.

457
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:40.510
Ted. I'm new here.

458
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:43.470
And I'm really trying
to prove myself.

459
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.299
So it's important to
me that the carnival

460
00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:49.563
day isn't a complete disaster.

461
00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:54.002
And in order to prevent that
I'm gonna need you to take this

462
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.352
a little bit more seriously.

463
00:18:56.483 --> 00:18:57.919
There's something you
should know about me.

464
00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:01.183
Everything I do pretty
much turns out great.

465
00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:02.271
Really?

466
00:19:02.402 --> 00:19:05.144
Yes. really.

467
00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:06.362
I find that hard to believe.

468
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:07.624
Then you'll be
pleasantly surprised

469
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:09.235
when I prove it to you.

470
00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:10.671
Now what's the bad news?

471
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.586
The bad news is that
the prices have gone up.

472
00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:14.762
So to cover the cost increase
we're gonna need to bring

473
00:19:14.892 --> 00:19:17.852
in 30% more than last year.

474
00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:19.070
Is there a poster
in this room that

475
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.507
could tell us how to do that?

476
00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:22.291
We need to cut our costs.

477
00:19:22.422 --> 00:19:24.467
Or-- hear me out.

478
00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:27.035
We could just bring
in 30% more people.

479
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.516
But then we would have to
rent more games to accommodate

480
00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:32.475
the extra people. which
would bring our costs up.

481
00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:35.130
and we need our
costs to go down.

482
00:19:35.261 --> 00:19:37.698
Not if we add things
that aren't rented.

483
00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:39.047
Like what?

484
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.181
Like a raffle with prizes.

485
00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:48.709
Employ the economic principle
of opportunity cost.

486
00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:51.146
It costs money for the
opportunity to win a prize.

487
00:19:56.107 --> 00:19:58.284
That's not what that means.

488
00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:00.764
So you like the raffle idea?

489
00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:03.811
Yeah. if we can get
the prizes donated.

490
00:20:03.941 --> 00:20:05.421
Gratis prizes on the way.

491
00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:07.075
Consider it done.

492
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:11.993
Oh. this booth is the most
expensive of all to rent.

493
00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:13.777
I'm thinking we
should just nix it.

494
00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:14.996
Will people missed it?

495
00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:15.910
The dunk tank?

496
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.564
Uh. yeah.

497
00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:19.914
Last year there was a line
for that 30 students long.

498
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.662
I have an idea.

499
00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:30.272
What if we build it
instead of renting it?

500
00:20:30.403 --> 00:20:31.578
Build it?

501
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.015
Like with hammers and nails?

502
00:20:34.145 --> 00:20:35.364
It makes more
sense to build one

503
00:20:35.495 --> 00:20:36.974
the school can use
every year than waste

504
00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:38.715
money renting it over and over.

505
00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:41.457
I'm sure that's an economic
principle of some sort.

506
00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:43.111
No.

507
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.287
But it's a great idea
if you could do it.

508
00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:46.897
Let me guess.

509
00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:51.162
You are really great at
building dunk tanks. too.

510
00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:53.034
I'm actually pretty handy.

511
00:20:53.164 --> 00:20:55.254
And the specs are
all right here. so--

512
00:20:55.384 --> 00:20:57.473
But will we have enough time?

513
00:20:57.604 --> 00:20:59.780
The carnival is only
in four weekends.

514
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.477
With the both of
us working on it.

515
00:21:01.608 --> 00:21:02.957
I'm confident we
can get it done.

516
00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:06.526
OK.

517
00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:10.269
Deal.

518
00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:29.897
How many questions are there?

519
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.347
No brothers and sisters.
just me and my mom.

520
00:21:45.478 --> 00:21:46.740
Same.

521
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.219
I've always been really
close to my mother.

522
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.961
We try to stay involved
in each other's lives.

523
00:21:51.092 --> 00:21:52.311
Awe.

524
00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:54.356
Yeah. now that I'm
back I'm really

525
00:21:54.487 --> 00:21:56.402
looking forward to having
that sort of relationship

526
00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:57.316
with my mom again.

527
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.450
Hey.

528
00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.017
Hi.

529
00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:05.585
She's an only child.

530
00:22:05.715 --> 00:22:07.543
I'll keep you updated.

531
00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:08.805
OK. bye.

532
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:11.765
Sorry.

533
00:22:11.895 --> 00:22:13.157
That was her.

534
00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:14.507
When I showed her
your pic on the site.

535
00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:15.986
she wanted to know a
little more about you.

536
00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:17.553
Oh.

537
00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:18.902
OK.

538
00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:20.295
Your profile said
you like to travel.

539
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:21.775
Anywhere exotic?

540
00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:23.472
Many places.

541
00:22:23.603 --> 00:22:25.256
My favorite has
got to be Cambodia.

542
00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:27.650
I got to see Angkor Wat.
which was absolutely amazing.

543
00:22:27.781 --> 00:22:28.651
No way.

544
00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:30.087
That's on my bucket list.

545
00:22:30.218 --> 00:22:31.524
You'd love it.
We spent the entire day just--

546
00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:33.526
Hang on just a sec.

547
00:22:33.656 --> 00:22:34.396
Hey.

548
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.267
Hi. mom.

549
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.531
She said she's
been to Angkor Wat.

550
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:41.664
Yeah. she loved it.

551
00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:45.015
Mom wants to know how long
the flight is to Cambodia.

552
00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:47.017
20 hours.

553
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.062
20 hours.

554
00:22:50.847 --> 00:22:52.066
I know.

555
00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:53.415
Remember when we went
to Cabo and missed

556
00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:54.416
our connecting flight.

557
00:22:57.506 --> 00:22:58.333
Give me a minute.

558
00:22:58.464 --> 00:23:00.291
We're talking about Cabo.

559
00:23:03.164 --> 00:23:04.731
Yeah.

560
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:06.907
I had to ask. can you drink
the water in the airport?

561
00:23:07.037 --> 00:23:07.908
Is that safe?

562
00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:25.491
Morning.

563
00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:26.927
Good morning.

564
00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:28.363
Nice house.

565
00:23:28.494 --> 00:23:29.973
Thanks.

566
00:23:30.104 --> 00:23:31.540
I guess playing on
tour had a few perks.

567
00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:37.285
What?

568
00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:38.808
Nothing.

569
00:23:38.939 --> 00:23:43.334
I just-- I'm used to
seeing you in silk blouses.

570
00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:44.727
Yeah. well these
are the clothes

571
00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:48.209
I don't mind getting dirty.

572
00:23:48.339 --> 00:23:49.950
OK. so I brought my cordless
drill. paint brushes.

573
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.342
and the miter saw.

574
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:52.387
I wasn't sure if you
were gonna have one.

575
00:23:52.518 --> 00:23:53.954
OK.

576
00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:56.043
Having two will definitely help.

577
00:23:56.173 --> 00:23:57.000
OK. I'll go grab it.

578
00:23:57.131 --> 00:23:58.045
All right.

579
00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:11.972
We're gonna run
out of blue paint.

580
00:24:12.102 --> 00:24:14.061
I have some in the garage.

581
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:15.541
Bottom shelf to the right.

582
00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:19.719
Oh. still
I'm searching for you.

583
00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:23.810
Insane for searching for you.

584
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.420
Yeah. I'm searching for you.

585
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:30.077
Searching for you.

586
00:24:30.207 --> 00:24:32.209
Searching for you.

587
00:24:40.696 --> 00:24:42.393
Wow.

588
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:44.526
'66 Mustang.

589
00:24:47.268 --> 00:24:48.791
It's gorgeous.

590
00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:50.271
Did you restore it yourself?

591
00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:51.664
For my dad.

592
00:24:51.794 --> 00:24:54.275
It's an anniversary
gift from me and my mom.

593
00:24:54.405 --> 00:24:56.233
They went on their very
first date in the car

594
00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:59.715
just like this 42 years ago.

595
00:24:59.846 --> 00:25:02.239
Well. it's such a great gift.

596
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.808
It will be if i can finish
it before their party.

597
00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:06.853
When is that?

598
00:25:06.983 --> 00:25:08.376
Next month.

599
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:12.423
But there's a part I
cannot seem to find.

600
00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:13.990
I've literally looked
everywhere for it.

601
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:15.905
Which part?

602
00:25:16.036 --> 00:25:17.385
The gearshift handle.

603
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.604
Well. what's wrong
with the one right there?

604
00:25:18.734 --> 00:25:20.040
Looks perfect to me.

605
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.476
My dad's was silver.

606
00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:24.000
This one is wood grain.

607
00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:25.219
Do you think he'll care?

608
00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:26.655
Probably not.

609
00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:28.657
But I do.

610
00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:33.444
I want every single piece
to look exactly the same.

611
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:35.882
If I'm gonna go through
this much for work.

612
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:38.928
why take shortcuts?

613
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.148
Didn't picture you as
such a perfectionist.

614
00:25:41.278 --> 00:25:43.672
Why not?

615
00:25:43.803 --> 00:25:47.850
Well. your socks
don't match. for one.

616
00:25:57.251 --> 00:25:59.166
I think we made some
real good headway.

617
00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:01.821
If teaching doesn't work
out we could start a dunk

618
00:26:01.951 --> 00:26:03.823
tank manufacturing business.

619
00:26:03.953 --> 00:26:05.128
Ship these things world wide.

620
00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:14.442
Where did you
teach before Faraday?

621
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.400
A tennis club.

622
00:26:16.531 --> 00:26:17.793
I gave private lessons.

623
00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:19.621
Oh.

624
00:26:19.752 --> 00:26:21.623
Why did you leave a ritzy club
to teach high school students?

625
00:26:25.366 --> 00:26:27.890
I started to
get bored with it.

626
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:31.633
The students were all willing
to pay for expensive lessons

627
00:26:31.764 --> 00:26:32.852
to get good at a sport.

628
00:26:32.982 --> 00:26:35.594
Oh. sounds absolutely awful.

629
00:26:39.032 --> 00:26:42.078
Any tennis pro can
help them do that.

630
00:26:42.209 --> 00:26:44.733
I thought it'd be
more fun to get

631
00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:47.170
kids who had never
played before excited

632
00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:48.171
about the game of tennis.

633
00:26:52.132 --> 00:26:56.179
The straight A
students. they're easy.

634
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.750
It's the kids that struggle that
need a really skilled teacher.

635
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:06.233
Without one. they may
miss an opportunity

636
00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:08.975
they never knew they had.

637
00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:11.020
That's a really good point.

638
00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:13.719
Yeah.

639
00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.895
What about you?

640
00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:17.548
You always want to teach?

641
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.246
Yes.

642
00:27:19.376 --> 00:27:21.552
Originally. I wanted to be
an elementary school teacher.

643
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:24.817
But then I went to
college. and I just--

644
00:27:24.947 --> 00:27:26.340
I fell in love with economics.

645
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.082
And I wanted to teach
that subject specifically.

646
00:27:29.212 --> 00:27:33.129
Six-year-olds don't care
about the consumer price index?

647
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.219
Not as much as you'd hope.

648
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.613
Well. should we clean this up?

649
00:27:38.744 --> 00:27:40.006
I'll do it.

650
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:41.268
You sure?

651
00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:42.573
Yeah.

652
00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:44.314
I'll store everything
in the garage.

653
00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:48.318
We could pick up where
we left off next weekend.

654
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:49.363
All right.

655
00:27:55.412 --> 00:27:57.153
Thanks for the pizza.

656
00:27:57.284 --> 00:27:58.198
My pleasure.

657
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:08.991
Good night.

658
00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:09.992
Good night. Liz.

659
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.742
Just tell Courtney to
call me back please.

660
00:28:20.873 --> 00:28:22.831
It's regarding a raffle.

661
00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:24.093
Thanks.

662
00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:26.182
Bye.

663
00:28:26.313 --> 00:28:27.053
Hey. buddy.

664
00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:28.445
What's up?

665
00:28:28.576 --> 00:28:30.796
Hey. coach.

666
00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:33.799
I just want to let you know
that I'm quitting the team.

667
00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:35.365
Why?

668
00:28:35.496 --> 00:28:38.325
I'm just not very good
at tennis or any sport

669
00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:39.543
pretty much.

670
00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:41.110
That's not true.

671
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.851
You've improved a ton since
the start of the year.

672
00:28:42.982 --> 00:28:46.072
I know. but I don't
think it's enough.

673
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:49.379
I'm just not
athletically inclined.

674
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:53.775
Listen. if what you're saying
is true. I'd be honest with you

675
00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:56.038
and tell you you're
wasting your time.

676
00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:58.954
But what you're
saying isn't true.

677
00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:00.782
And if you stick with
it a little longer.

678
00:29:00.913 --> 00:29:02.741
I'm sure you'll
surprise yourself.

679
00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:06.832
As a favor to me. give
it another three weeks.

680
00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:07.833
You won't regret it.

681
00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:10.966
We'll see.

682
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:25.676
Please. just be a
normal person. Pete.

683
00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:33.206
Well. what do you think?

684
00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:34.555
Looks pretty good to me.

685
00:29:34.685 --> 00:29:37.036
But is it functional?

686
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:39.386
Won't know till we try it out.

687
00:29:39.516 --> 00:29:40.343
Shall we?

688
00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.302
Let's do it.

689
00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:43.346
OK.

690
00:29:48.482 --> 00:29:50.049
Oh.

691
00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:51.050
Ouch.

692
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.792
I was just warming up.

693
00:29:53.922 --> 00:29:58.622
OK. this is the one.

694
00:29:58.753 --> 00:30:00.320
Oof.

695
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.626
Somebody obviously didn't
play softball in high school.

696
00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:03.540
One more.

697
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:04.585
Here we go.

698
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:08.807
Yes!

699
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:11.984
OK. I guess third
time's the charm.

700
00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:13.550
Let's see what
you got. hotshot.

701
00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:14.595
OK.

702
00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:19.034
You ready for this?

703
00:30:19.165 --> 00:30:20.035
Mhm.

704
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:24.997
Oh.

705
00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:26.737
Looks like nobody's
getting dunked.

706
00:30:35.877 --> 00:30:37.487
Bullseye!

707
00:30:37.618 --> 00:30:39.272
You didn't really think I'd
missed that two times in a row.

708
00:30:39.402 --> 00:30:40.926
did you?

709
00:30:41.056 --> 00:30:42.318
Do you ever stop telling
people how great you are?

710
00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:44.668
Only when I'm telling
them how great they are.

711
00:30:46.453 --> 00:30:48.890
Hold on.

712
00:30:49.021 --> 00:30:49.935
Oh. I got to take this.

713
00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:50.892
OK.

714
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:55.114
Hello?

715
00:30:55.244 --> 00:30:56.028
Ted. Hi.

716
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:57.159
It's Courtney.

717
00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.031
Courtney. hey.

718
00:30:59.161 --> 00:30:59.945
I've missed you.

719
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:02.251
I've missed you. too.

720
00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.906
Have you been back to the
club at all since everything

721
00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:05.776
that happened with--

722
00:31:05.907 --> 00:31:08.083
No. I--

723
00:31:08.214 --> 00:31:09.998
I haven't been back.

724
00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:12.392
Well. your message said
you're in need of raffle prizes.

725
00:31:12.522 --> 00:31:13.480
and I can help you out.

726
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.960
I knew I could count on you.

727
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.745
How about three
cases of last year's

728
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:20.356
vintage including our
limited release cab?

729
00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:21.792
You're incredible.

730
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:24.273
Please. it's the least
I can do after you spent

731
00:31:24.404 --> 00:31:25.927
all that time fixing my car.

732
00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:27.189
I was happy to.

733
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.538
One condition on
the wine. though.

734
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:30.323
You need to come
get it yourself.

735
00:31:30.453 --> 00:31:32.281
It's been a long time
since you've been up.

736
00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:33.413
Even better.

737
00:31:33.543 --> 00:31:34.936
Thank you so much.

738
00:31:35.067 --> 00:31:36.720
Wednesday is a school holiday.

739
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.591
How's that work?

740
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:39.332
Wednesday is perfect.

741
00:31:39.462 --> 00:31:40.899
OK. I'll see you then.

742
00:31:44.032 --> 00:31:45.991
Hey.

743
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:47.209
Was that your girlfriend?

744
00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.125
No. I used to teach
Courtney tennis.

745
00:31:50.256 --> 00:31:51.779
You like wine?

746
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.954
Wine?

747
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:55.000
She owns a winery
in Santa Ynez.

748
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.480
and she's donating a few cases.

749
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:59.439
You want to go with
me on our off day.

750
00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:02.703
pick them up. maybe do
a little wine tasting?

751
00:32:02.833 --> 00:32:04.966
I haven't been to
a winery in ages.

752
00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:06.141
Is that a yes?

753
00:32:06.272 --> 00:32:07.055
Yeah.

754
00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:08.013
That's a yes.

755
00:32:20.721 --> 00:32:23.332
So these vines are
our syrah grapes.

756
00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:24.507
That's what we're
drinking. right?

757
00:32:24.638 --> 00:32:25.944
Yes. it is.

758
00:32:26.074 --> 00:32:27.597
Syrah is a young
wine. so we don't

759
00:32:27.728 --> 00:32:29.208
age them beyond three years.

760
00:32:29.338 --> 00:32:32.646
What fruit flavors do you taste?

761
00:32:32.776 --> 00:32:33.908
Mm.

762
00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:37.956
Um. plum and cherry?

763
00:32:38.086 --> 00:32:41.742
Yeah. and blackberry?

764
00:32:41.872 --> 00:32:44.745
It's kind of spicy. too.

765
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:46.355
I like it.

766
00:32:46.486 --> 00:32:48.488
Syrah grapes contain
the same flavor

767
00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:50.403
compound found in peppercorns.

768
00:32:50.533 --> 00:32:53.667
So it pairs well with
lamb. steak. braised beef.

769
00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:55.843
And if you reduce it. it
makes a great demi-glace.

770
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:56.800
I had no idea.

771
00:32:56.931 --> 00:32:57.845
That's fascinating.

772
00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:05.113
Right up here is where we
have our smaller weddings.

773
00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:08.943
I love it.

774
00:33:09.074 --> 00:33:10.640
If you'll excuse
me. I have an issue

775
00:33:10.771 --> 00:33:12.381
that I have to take care of.

776
00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:14.731
How about I meet you back in
the tasting room in 15 minutes?

777
00:33:14.862 --> 00:33:15.645
We'll be there.

778
00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:16.690
Thanks for the tour.

779
00:33:21.695 --> 00:33:26.134
I can totally see why people
pick this spot to get married.

780
00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:29.746
It's so serene.

781
00:33:29.877 --> 00:33:31.748
It'd be nice to live
out here. wouldn't it?

782
00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:33.446
A dream come true.

783
00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:36.884
Can you imagine waking
up to this every morning?

784
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:41.062
Drinking coffee. watching
the sunrise over the vineyard.

785
00:33:41.193 --> 00:33:42.890
Sitting on a lawn
chair at night sipping

786
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.024
wine. maybe counting the stars.

787
00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:47.025
Listening to the crickets.

788
00:33:54.597 --> 00:33:56.338
So where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

789
00:33:56.469 --> 00:33:58.732
Good question.

790
00:33:58.862 --> 00:34:00.299
Still teaching at Faraday.

791
00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:04.259
Spending my weekends and
summers traveling. hopefully

792
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:06.131
with someone who
likes to do the same.

793
00:34:09.134 --> 00:34:11.353
Where would you like to go?

794
00:34:11.484 --> 00:34:13.051
Wimbledon.

795
00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:14.835
Indian Wells.

796
00:34:14.965 --> 00:34:16.837
French Open.

797
00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:19.796
I think those are
tennis tournaments.

798
00:34:19.927 --> 00:34:21.581
Yes.

799
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:24.018
But I do hear Paris has a few
other things to offer as well.

800
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.807
What about you?

801
00:34:33.723 --> 00:34:35.551
What's your life look like
10 years down the road?

802
00:34:35.682 --> 00:34:39.599
Um. similar to yours.
except not watching tennis.

803
00:34:39.729 --> 00:34:42.471
Maybe doing something a
little bit more exotic.

804
00:34:42.602 --> 00:34:43.733
Exotic?

805
00:34:43.864 --> 00:34:45.431
OK.

806
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:48.738
Exotic like diving with sharks
on the Great Barrier Reef

807
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:53.352
or exotic like I wonder if
there's guava in this cocktail?

808
00:34:53.482 --> 00:34:56.877
Um. I'm down for both.

809
00:34:57.007 --> 00:34:58.531
I'll watch from the boat.

810
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:01.055
OK.

811
00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:02.404
This place is
pretty amazing. right?

812
00:35:02.535 --> 00:35:03.449
Mhm.

813
00:35:07.366 --> 00:35:08.758
You ever think
about getting married?

814
00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:10.064
Yeah. definitely.

815
00:35:10.195 --> 00:35:11.065
To the right person.

816
00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:15.852
- Is that funny?
- Oh.

817
00:35:15.983 --> 00:35:17.593
No. no.

818
00:35:17.724 --> 00:35:18.725
I recently just answered that
question on a questionnaire

819
00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:20.161
I did not too long ago.

820
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:22.598
Wait. Dylan and
Ariella's matchmaking site?

821
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:23.817
They got you. too?

822
00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:24.731
Yes.

823
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:25.732
But it's impossible.

824
00:35:25.862 --> 00:35:26.733
I gave up halfway.

825
00:35:26.863 --> 00:35:27.777
Did you go on any dates?

826
00:35:27.908 --> 00:35:29.953
Two really awful coffee dates.

827
00:35:30.084 --> 00:35:30.867
How awful?

828
00:35:30.998 --> 00:35:31.912
It's too traumatic.

829
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:32.782
Really?

830
00:35:32.913 --> 00:35:33.696
Yeah.

831
00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:35.829
That bad?

832
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:38.919
I can't imagine anyone
having a bad date with you.

833
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:39.920
Thanks.

834
00:35:47.057 --> 00:35:49.059
We should probably head back.

835
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.191
Courtney might be waiting.

836
00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:51.192
OK.

837
00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:01.898
This is our 2016 red blend.

838
00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:03.944
It's a mix of our
grapes and grapes

839
00:36:04.074 --> 00:36:05.902
from a winery in Napa Valley.

840
00:36:06.033 --> 00:36:07.687
But we processed
and aged it here.

841
00:36:07.817 --> 00:36:08.601
Yeah?

842
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.471
Thank you.

843
00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:10.907
Enjoy.

844
00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:11.908
All right.

845
00:36:17.523 --> 00:36:19.264
All right. where
should we start?

846
00:36:19.394 --> 00:36:21.918
OK. let's start
with this first.

847
00:36:22.049 --> 00:36:23.659
And then after we finish.
we can enjoy the wine.

848
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.530
OK.

849
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.922
OK.

850
00:36:26.053 --> 00:36:28.229
So for the ring toss
I'm thinking we get

851
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.013
stuffed bears for the winners.

852
00:36:30.144 --> 00:36:32.059
But I'm wondering what we should
do for the consolation prize

853
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.800
and how many should we order?

854
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.062
Consolation prizes?

855
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.194
Yeah. for the
people that miss.

856
00:36:36.324 --> 00:36:38.935
which I feel it will be 90%.

857
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:42.069
If they don't throw a ring on
the bottle. they get nothing.

858
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.853
They didn't complete the task.

859
00:36:43.984 --> 00:36:47.944
So you don't want to give out
anything to people that miss?

860
00:36:48.075 --> 00:36:51.426
Consolation prizes go against
the very spirit of competition.

861
00:36:51.557 --> 00:36:54.255
The point of playing
is to win a prize.

862
00:36:54.386 --> 00:36:56.214
"Win" is the
operative word there.

863
00:36:56.344 --> 00:36:59.304
Yeah. the people that
win get the better prize.

864
00:36:59.434 --> 00:37:00.609
They get the bear.

865
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.263
Then what motivates
them to try again?

866
00:37:02.394 --> 00:37:04.831
They already won a prize.

867
00:37:04.961 --> 00:37:06.049
The bear.

868
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.442
So you admit.
they'd rather have

869
00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:09.139
the bear than one of these--

870
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.054
I don't even know what that is.

871
00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:12.404
Is that a charm bracelet?

872
00:37:12.534 --> 00:37:16.364
No it's-- it's a
key-chain. I think.

873
00:37:16.495 --> 00:37:20.455
And obviously people would
want to win the bear.

874
00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:22.065
I mean. maybe it's
a luggage tag.

875
00:37:22.196 --> 00:37:24.154
Then why give
it to them at all?

876
00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.678
So they don't feel bad.

877
00:37:25.808 --> 00:37:27.767
But they're going to
feel bad anyway because A.

878
00:37:27.897 --> 00:37:29.072
they didn't win the bear.

879
00:37:29.203 --> 00:37:31.336
And B. they failed.

880
00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:33.120
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

881
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:34.861
It's what makes them try
harder the next time.

882
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:36.863
No. that's not true.

883
00:37:36.993 --> 00:37:41.650
We should be rewarding them for
putting themselves out there.

884
00:37:41.781 --> 00:37:42.869
Please tell me you're kidding.

885
00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:44.436
No. not at all.

886
00:37:44.566 --> 00:37:46.438
I mean. I gave a medal to
every one of my students

887
00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:48.570
that participated in the
entrepreneurship challenge

888
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:50.485
even though not all of them won.

889
00:37:54.228 --> 00:37:56.448
You really want the
kids to buy a ticket

890
00:37:56.578 --> 00:37:57.623
and go home with nothing?

891
00:37:57.753 --> 00:37:59.146
I want them to
leave with a bear.

892
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.017
But that's not gonna
happen for everyone.

893
00:38:01.148 --> 00:38:05.587
Look. I get the whole second
places. first loser mentality.

894
00:38:05.718 --> 00:38:07.067
but this is carnival day.

895
00:38:07.197 --> 00:38:08.895
It's supposed to be fun.

896
00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:11.289
It's not the Australian Open.

897
00:38:30.612 --> 00:38:32.527
Thanks for taking
me up there today.

898
00:38:32.658 --> 00:38:34.834
You're welcome.

899
00:38:34.964 --> 00:38:36.749
I feel like you're still
mad about the key-chain thing.

900
00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:39.882
They're luggage tags.

901
00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:41.841
And I'm not upset.

902
00:38:41.971 --> 00:38:46.585
If you really feel that
strongly about it. it's fine.

903
00:38:46.715 --> 00:38:48.848
OK.

904
00:38:48.978 --> 00:38:52.547
You sure you don't want me
to keep the wine at my place?

905
00:38:52.678 --> 00:38:53.722
I'm sure.

906
00:38:53.853 --> 00:38:54.854
I promise I
won't drink it all.

907
00:38:57.596 --> 00:38:59.424
I'll take care of it.

908
00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:00.686
All right.

909
00:39:00.816 --> 00:39:01.687
Good night.

910
00:39:21.054 --> 00:39:22.490
Uh-huh.

911
00:39:22.621 --> 00:39:24.144
Thanks. Giovanni.

912
00:39:24.274 --> 00:39:26.059
I owe you one.

913
00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:27.582
I guess I don't
really have a choice.

914
00:39:27.713 --> 00:39:28.583
Ted.

915
00:39:28.714 --> 00:39:29.584
Hey. Gina.

916
00:39:29.715 --> 00:39:30.803
Hi.

917
00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:32.239
Tennis team looks good.

918
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.675
Yeah.

919
00:39:33.806 --> 00:39:34.894
I should probably
go check on them.

920
00:39:35.024 --> 00:39:36.374
Wait.

921
00:39:36.504 --> 00:39:38.767
I heard you're doing a
raffle for Carnival day.

922
00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:41.117
My sister works at a spa.
and I'm sure she'd donated

923
00:39:41.248 --> 00:39:42.989
a gift basket or something.

924
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.251
That'd be terrific.

925
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:45.165
Thank you.

926
00:39:45.295 --> 00:39:46.688
No problem.

927
00:39:46.819 --> 00:39:49.169
I'll bring it by your
house on Saturday evening.

928
00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:50.910
Drop me a pin with your address.

929
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.999
You really don't
have to do that.

930
00:39:53.129 --> 00:39:54.957
I'll come by your
classroom on Monday.

931
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:56.394
And risk something
happening to it?

932
00:39:56.524 --> 00:39:58.918
No way.

933
00:39:59.048 --> 00:39:59.962
I think I may
have accidentally

934
00:40:00.093 --> 00:40:01.007
deleted your number.

935
00:40:01.137 --> 00:40:02.225
I have yours.

936
00:40:02.356 --> 00:40:04.227
I'll shoot you a text.

937
00:40:04.358 --> 00:40:07.100
That works. I guess.

938
00:40:21.723 --> 00:40:24.247
Mm. smells good in here.

939
00:40:24.378 --> 00:40:26.467
Honey. you look beautiful.

940
00:40:26.598 --> 00:40:27.512
Really?

941
00:40:27.642 --> 00:40:29.296
You don't think it's too much?

942
00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:31.951
This guy is gonna be drooling
the moment he sets eyes on you.

943
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:34.432
Thanks for that visual. mom.

944
00:40:34.562 --> 00:40:35.650
I don't know.

945
00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:37.086
After those last
two coffee dates.

946
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.132
I'm wondering if it's
worth all this effort.

947
00:40:39.262 --> 00:40:40.829
Well. didn't this guy
ask you out for dinner

948
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.135
instead of just coffee?

949
00:40:42.265 --> 00:40:45.051
I mean. that bodes
well in my opinion.

950
00:40:45.181 --> 00:40:47.227
Yeah. I guess you're right.

951
00:40:49.838 --> 00:40:53.102
Well. these look amazing.

952
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:55.409
Well. I still can't
believe that the coffee

953
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.672
shop doubled their order.

954
00:40:57.803 --> 00:40:59.413
I'm not surprised
in the slightest.

955
00:40:59.544 --> 00:41:03.548
Look at you go. you
little entrepreneur.

956
00:41:03.678 --> 00:41:04.462
Oh.

957
00:41:04.592 --> 00:41:05.724
What about your dinner?

958
00:41:05.854 --> 00:41:09.249
For one of your
cookies I could cheat.

959
00:41:09.379 --> 00:41:11.947
Mm.

960
00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:13.775
Remember you used to bake
these for me when I was a kid

961
00:41:13.906 --> 00:41:14.994
and I had a bad day?

962
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:16.778
Put a smile on
your face every time.

963
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.654
OK. you better get going.

964
00:41:22.784 --> 00:41:23.611
Bye.

965
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:30.618
Mm.

966
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:39.148
So what's your favorite
thing about being an educator?

967
00:41:39.279 --> 00:41:42.195
Good question.

968
00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:46.286
This is gonna sound so
cliche. but I just love having

969
00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:48.810
a positive impact on kids.

970
00:41:48.941 --> 00:41:50.682
And I know I only spend
an hour a day with them.

971
00:41:50.812 --> 00:41:56.862
but I just feel like I'm really
helping mold their future.

972
00:41:56.992 --> 00:42:00.039
I had a teacher in high school
who made a real difference.

973
00:42:00.169 --> 00:42:02.607
She's actually the reason
I became an architect.

974
00:42:02.737 --> 00:42:03.521
Really?

975
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:05.044
How so?

976
00:42:05.174 --> 00:42:06.785
Well. for this class
project she had us read--

977
00:42:06.915 --> 00:42:08.264
Hi.

978
00:42:08.395 --> 00:42:09.657
Can you tell Giovanni
that Ted's here please?

979
00:42:09.788 --> 00:42:10.658
Sure.

980
00:42:17.273 --> 00:42:18.536
Oh my god. she
really said that?

981
00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:21.930
In front of
the entire class.

982
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:22.844
Ted.

983
00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:23.758
Liz.

984
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.499
Hey. what a coincidence.

985
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.415
I saw you so I
thought I'd say hi.

986
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.938
Hey.
Ted.

987
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.809
Nice to meet you.

988
00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:31.723
Pete.

989
00:42:31.853 --> 00:42:32.854
Is that the pescatore?

990
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:34.073
It is.

991
00:42:34.203 --> 00:42:35.596
That's the best
thing on the menu.

992
00:42:35.727 --> 00:42:37.250
The red pepper flakes
give it a nice kick. huh?

993
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.078
Is that what I'm tasting?

994
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:40.427
Yeah. it's delicious.

995
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:41.863
This place is the best.

996
00:42:41.994 --> 00:42:43.343
My parents are having
their anniversary party

997
00:42:43.473 --> 00:42:45.563
here in a couple of weeks.

998
00:42:45.693 --> 00:42:47.782
Are you here to eat?

999
00:42:47.913 --> 00:42:48.696
Me?

1000
00:42:48.827 --> 00:42:49.915
No.

1001
00:42:50.045 --> 00:42:51.786
I'm just picking
up some gift cards.

1002
00:42:51.917 --> 00:42:53.309
I thought they'd make
a good raffle prize.

1003
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.484
Are they donating them?

1004
00:42:54.615 --> 00:42:55.921
Yeah.

1005
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:57.183
I used to play tennis
with the owner Giovanni.

1006
00:42:57.313 --> 00:42:58.140
He's a great guy.

1007
00:42:58.271 --> 00:43:00.621
Oh. that is awesome.

1008
00:43:00.752 --> 00:43:03.406
Oh. Ted is also a
teacher at Faraday.

1009
00:43:03.537 --> 00:43:06.714
We are organizing the end of
the year carnival day together.

1010
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:09.325
That sounds like something
my nephew would enjoy.

1011
00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:12.154
It's gonna be amazing.

1012
00:43:12.285 --> 00:43:13.068
What do you teach?

1013
00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:14.026
Phys ed.

1014
00:43:14.156 --> 00:43:15.636
And I also coach tennis.

1015
00:43:15.767 --> 00:43:17.986
Are you certified by the
National Bureau of Tennis?

1016
00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:19.379
Yup.

1017
00:43:19.509 --> 00:43:21.033
I actually played on
tour for five years.

1018
00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:24.340
and then I hurt my shoulder
so I taught for a few years

1019
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:25.211
at Park Club.

1020
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:26.691
Really?

1021
00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:27.822
I live right down the
street from that Club.

1022
00:43:27.953 --> 00:43:29.084
I'm actually
thinking of joining.

1023
00:43:29.215 --> 00:43:30.608
Park's not the only good Club.

1024
00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:32.174
There's a lot in Santa Barbara.

1025
00:43:32.305 --> 00:43:33.523
What level are you?

1026
00:43:33.654 --> 00:43:35.221
Level?

1027
00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:38.790
I can get to the ball no
problem and keep a rally going.

1028
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.531
I guess I have
trouble placing shots.

1029
00:43:41.662 --> 00:43:42.750
Hm.

1030
00:43:42.881 --> 00:43:44.578
Mind if I sit?

1031
00:43:44.709 --> 00:43:47.146
If you follow NTR
program standards.

1032
00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:50.323
you're probably a 3.5.

1033
00:43:50.453 --> 00:43:51.890
What you need is
someone to help you

1034
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.806
focus on control
and depth of ball

1035
00:43:54.936 --> 00:43:56.677
and also increase your
repertoire of shots.

1036
00:43:56.808 --> 00:43:57.591
Exactly.

1037
00:43:57.722 --> 00:43:59.027
How's your net play?

1038
00:43:59.158 --> 00:44:00.115
Non-existent.

1039
00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:01.247
- What about your serve?
- Good.

1040
00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:02.509
I can put a spin on it.

1041
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.076
But on the return.
I'm just reacting.

1042
00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:05.164
Excuse me.

1043
00:44:05.294 --> 00:44:06.208
Oh. here you go.

1044
00:44:08.994 --> 00:44:12.084
I would focus on
precision and variety.

1045
00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:14.521
Then you could actually
employ strategies.

1046
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:17.611
and instead of your opponent
setting the pace. you will.

1047
00:44:17.742 --> 00:44:19.569
I think you're
absolutely right.

1048
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.528
Excuse me. I need
to go to the restroom.

1049
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:22.485
Yeah.

1050
00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:23.443
Sure.

1051
00:44:23.573 --> 00:44:24.792
Sorry.

1052
00:44:24.923 --> 00:44:25.750
Sorry.

1053
00:44:31.973 --> 00:44:33.671
OK. so what stroke
should I work on first?

1054
00:44:45.073 --> 00:44:46.771
Hey. partner.

1055
00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:48.468
I have some good news.

1056
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:50.383
I spoke with the owner at
Victory Times Sporting Goods.

1057
00:44:50.513 --> 00:44:52.602
she's donating five soccer
balls to our raffle.

1058
00:44:52.733 --> 00:44:54.343
Great.

1059
00:44:54.474 --> 00:44:56.302
I used to teach her
son at tennis club.

1060
00:44:56.432 --> 00:44:57.825
Super nice lady.

1061
00:44:57.956 --> 00:45:01.176
Thank goodness for your
vast knowledge of tennis.

1062
00:45:01.307 --> 00:45:02.700
Is everything OK?

1063
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.746
Peachy. just like that
gelato the three of us

1064
00:45:05.877 --> 00:45:07.574
shared yesterday.

1065
00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:11.317
That. I said we could
share the tiramisu instead.

1066
00:45:11.447 --> 00:45:12.840
It's not about
the dessert. Ted.

1067
00:45:12.971 --> 00:45:14.712
It's about the whole dinner.

1068
00:45:14.842 --> 00:45:16.496
What do you mean?

1069
00:45:16.626 --> 00:45:18.019
Never mind.
Don't worry about it.

1070
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.933
No.

1071
00:45:19.064 --> 00:45:20.282
What?

1072
00:45:20.413 --> 00:45:23.764
Please tell me what I did.

1073
00:45:23.895 --> 00:45:27.725
This was the first good date
I've had since I moved here.

1074
00:45:27.855 --> 00:45:29.509
and you hijacked it.

1075
00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:33.252
You sat down and you turned it
into the Ted Talks Tennis Show.

1076
00:45:33.382 --> 00:45:35.123
That was a date?

1077
00:45:35.254 --> 00:45:37.865
I didn't realize.

1078
00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:41.477
Two people. nice
restaurant. all dressed up.

1079
00:45:41.608 --> 00:45:43.610
At the winery you
made it seem like you'd

1080
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.178
gotten fed up with bad dates
and weren't seeing anyone.

1081
00:45:46.308 --> 00:45:48.441
I thought he was just a friend.

1082
00:45:48.571 --> 00:45:54.621
Besides. he didn't seem
like. you know. your type.

1083
00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:56.362
My type.

1084
00:45:56.492 --> 00:45:59.104
OK. Ted. you tell
me what my type is.

1085
00:45:59.234 --> 00:46:06.851
Nice looking. athletic. tall.
charismatic. athletic. smart.

1086
00:46:06.981 --> 00:46:08.678
You said athletic twice.

1087
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:10.593
And Pete is all of those things.

1088
00:46:10.724 --> 00:46:13.858
He didn't even know about the
pepper flakes on the pescatore.

1089
00:46:13.988 --> 00:46:15.207
I have to go.

1090
00:46:15.337 --> 00:46:18.253
Look. I'm sorry. OK?

1091
00:46:18.384 --> 00:46:20.690
I saw you sitting there
in the blue dress. which

1092
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:22.780
is a great color
on you by the way.

1093
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.871
and I just wanted to say hi and
tell you about the gift cards.

1094
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:28.481
But you're right.

1095
00:46:28.611 --> 00:46:31.571
I shouldn't have sat down.

1096
00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:34.922
I appreciate the apology.

1097
00:46:35.053 --> 00:46:37.229
Are you gonna see him again?

1098
00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:38.926
I don't know.

1099
00:46:39.057 --> 00:46:40.885
We didn't discuss it because
you walked us to the valet

1100
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:43.452
so the two of you
could exchange numbers.

1101
00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:45.063
Do you want me to
call him for you?

1102
00:46:45.193 --> 00:46:45.933
I could.

1103
00:46:46.064 --> 00:46:46.934
No.

1104
00:46:50.372 --> 00:46:51.721
The prizes were delivered.

1105
00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:53.941
They're in the storage room.

1106
00:46:54.072 --> 00:46:56.204
We should get together
and sort them.

1107
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.727
Yeah. of course.

1108
00:46:57.858 --> 00:46:59.207
I'll look at my schedule.

1109
00:46:59.338 --> 00:47:00.208
OK.

1110
00:47:17.138 --> 00:47:18.009
Oh.

1111
00:47:22.491 --> 00:47:23.536
Hello?

1112
00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:24.406
Liz. hi.

1113
00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:25.364
It's Pete.

1114
00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:27.018
Hey. how are you?

1115
00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:28.410
I'm good.

1116
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:30.108
I was down in LA this
past week for work.

1117
00:47:30.238 --> 00:47:31.805
But I'm back now.

1118
00:47:31.936 --> 00:47:34.242
And I wanted to let you know
I really enjoyed our dinner.

1119
00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:35.156
Thanks.

1120
00:47:35.287 --> 00:47:36.723
So did I.

1121
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:37.985
If you're free
tonight. I thought

1122
00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:39.378
maybe we could catch a movie?

1123
00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:40.770
Yeah. that sounds fun.

1124
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:41.684
Great.

1125
00:47:41.815 --> 00:47:42.642
Text me your address.

1126
00:47:42.772 --> 00:47:43.861
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

1127
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:44.774
OK. will do.

1128
00:47:44.905 --> 00:47:45.688
Bye.

1129
00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:46.689
Bye.

1130
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.394
Please tell your
mom thank you for me.

1131
00:47:55.524 --> 00:47:56.830
Oh. she was happy to do it.

1132
00:47:56.961 --> 00:47:58.832
I hope your grandmother
likes snickerdoodles.

1133
00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:01.748
That woman has a sweet
tooth like no one else.

1134
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:05.708
But she is turning 90 tomorrow.
so who am I to judge her diet?

1135
00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:08.581
So date number two
tonight. right?

1136
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:12.193
More like 1.2. the redo.

1137
00:48:12.324 --> 00:48:15.457
You didn't invite Ted
to tag along. did you?

1138
00:48:15.588 --> 00:48:18.721
Um. no.

1139
00:48:18.852 --> 00:48:21.637
How is circus
day coming along?

1140
00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:23.074
Is he pulling his weight?

1141
00:48:23.204 --> 00:48:24.814
He actually is.

1142
00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:27.078
He's got a lot of good ideas.
and he follows through.

1143
00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:28.340
Wow.

1144
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.211
Well. maybe underneath
that incredibly

1145
00:48:30.342 --> 00:48:31.560
annoying air of
confidence there is

1146
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:34.085
a real human being after all.

1147
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:35.129
Thank you.

1148
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.043
I'll see you tomorrow?

1149
00:48:36.174 --> 00:48:37.088
Yeah.

1150
00:48:37.218 --> 00:48:38.002
Have fun.

1151
00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:39.003
Thanks.

1152
00:48:39.133 --> 00:48:40.004
Bye.

1153
00:48:42.876 --> 00:48:43.790
Oof.

1154
00:48:52.103 --> 00:48:53.582
So your meeting in LA went well?

1155
00:48:53.713 --> 00:48:55.149
It did.

1156
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.759
And I got to see my uncle
when I was down there.

1157
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.631
He's pretty busy with his
show starting this weekend.

1158
00:48:58.761 --> 00:48:59.806
but we got lunch.

1159
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.199
Oh. is he an actor?

1160
00:49:01.329 --> 00:49:02.069
Niall?

1161
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.636
No.

1162
00:49:03.766 --> 00:49:06.247
No. he organizes a huge
auto show at the convention

1163
00:49:06.378 --> 00:49:07.161
center every year.

1164
00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:08.771
Oh. really?

1165
00:49:08.902 --> 00:49:09.903
Yeah. it's like 1.000 cars.

1166
00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:10.904
It's so much work.

1167
00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:13.211
I don't know how he does it.

1168
00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:15.953
This is kind of random. but
do you think he might know where

1169
00:49:16.083 --> 00:49:18.564
I can find an original
silver gearshift

1170
00:49:18.694 --> 00:49:20.479
handle for a '66 Mustang?

1171
00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:21.480
That's really specific.

1172
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:22.698
I know.

1173
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:24.222
Um. probably.

1174
00:49:24.352 --> 00:49:26.789
I mean. he knows a lot of
people who restore cars.

1175
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.052
I could just give
you his phone number.

1176
00:49:28.182 --> 00:49:30.358
Oh. that'd be great.

1177
00:49:33.187 --> 00:49:34.145
Thank you.

1178
00:49:34.275 --> 00:49:35.146
Yeah.

1179
00:49:39.063 --> 00:49:41.021
So did you get up to
anything else in LA?

1180
00:49:41.152 --> 00:49:42.196
Any sightseeing?

1181
00:49:42.327 --> 00:49:43.850
I'm not really
a sightseeing guy.

1182
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:46.113
I kind of hate places where
there are so many people.

1183
00:49:46.244 --> 00:49:48.333
Oh. well what about
the Griffith Observatory?

1184
00:49:48.463 --> 00:49:49.464
That place is so cool.

1185
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:50.509
I love constellations.

1186
00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:51.858
Me too.

1187
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:53.425
But if you've been
to an observatory.

1188
00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:55.340
you've kind of seen them all.

1189
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.776
The Big Dipper
looks the same now

1190
00:49:56.906 --> 00:49:59.518
as it did 500 years ago. right?

1191
00:49:59.648 --> 00:50:01.607
I guess.

1192
00:50:01.737 --> 00:50:04.392
I was gonna go wine
tasting in Temecula.

1193
00:50:04.523 --> 00:50:06.612
but the drive. it's
like an hour and a half.

1194
00:50:06.742 --> 00:50:08.440
And who wants to be
in traffic that long?

1195
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:10.311
No. thank you.

1196
00:50:10.442 --> 00:50:13.314
I just hung around in the
hotel and watched movies.

1197
00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:17.971
Hey. it's starting.

1198
00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:40.733
What's in this?

1199
00:50:40.863 --> 00:50:43.083
Your guess is as good as mine.

1200
00:50:43.214 --> 00:50:44.693
I found it in the
storage closet.

1201
00:50:44.824 --> 00:50:48.784
Well. is it in the forecast
that it's going to rain?

1202
00:50:48.915 --> 00:50:51.309
Because if so. I am ready.

1203
00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:58.142
Actually. I hate
to burst your bubble.

1204
00:50:58.272 --> 00:51:01.841
but there is zero
chance of rain today.

1205
00:51:04.844 --> 00:51:05.932
OK.

1206
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:12.547
Well. good because
this hair does

1207
00:51:12.678 --> 00:51:14.071
not do well in the humidity.

1208
00:51:17.944 --> 00:51:25.560
You're in luck
because don't you worry

1209
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:27.345
about a thing. little lady.

1210
00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:30.304
We can fix that at
the hair saloon.

1211
00:51:30.435 --> 00:51:31.392
That is too cheesy.

1212
00:51:31.523 --> 00:51:32.350
What?

1213
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.961
That was pretty funny.

1214
00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:36.223
Wait.

1215
00:51:36.354 --> 00:51:38.399
I have a good one for you.

1216
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:39.444
Oh.

1217
00:51:46.755 --> 00:51:49.410
A magician's hat?

1218
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:50.716
You're full of surprises.

1219
00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:57.070
Ms. Harris.

1220
00:51:57.201 --> 00:51:58.506
Coach Packerson.

1221
00:51:58.637 --> 00:52:00.639
Ariella. what are
you doing in here?

1222
00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:03.120
I accidentally
left my backpack.

1223
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.818
We were just sorting
prizes for carnival day.

1224
00:52:05.948 --> 00:52:07.341
Are you planning on going?

1225
00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:08.864
It's gonna be a lot
of fun this year.

1226
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:10.127
Yeah.

1227
00:52:10.257 --> 00:52:11.128
Yeah.

1228
00:52:25.925 --> 00:52:26.882
Did you ever
get that gearshift

1229
00:52:27.013 --> 00:52:28.406
handle for your dad's car?

1230
00:52:28.536 --> 00:52:29.885
Party is next weekend. right?

1231
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.539
Nope.

1232
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:32.845
I've been so busy with this.
I haven't had time to call

1233
00:52:32.975 --> 00:52:35.413
around or scan the photos.

1234
00:52:35.543 --> 00:52:36.849
Photos?

1235
00:52:36.979 --> 00:52:38.590
My dad has photos
of him and my mom

1236
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.810
he wants me to scan so they
can play an party.

1237
00:52:41.941 --> 00:52:43.203
I can get that for you.

1238
00:52:43.334 --> 00:52:44.813
I have a color scanner at home.

1239
00:52:44.944 --> 00:52:45.727
Really?

1240
00:52:45.858 --> 00:52:47.076
They're in my truck.

1241
00:52:47.207 --> 00:52:48.121
OK.

1242
00:52:53.387 --> 00:52:54.214
Thank you.

1243
00:52:54.345 --> 00:52:55.476
This helps a lot.

1244
00:52:55.607 --> 00:52:57.086
It is no problem.

1245
00:52:57.217 --> 00:52:58.131
I'm starving.

1246
00:52:58.262 --> 00:53:01.003
Would you want to grab a bite?

1247
00:53:01.134 --> 00:53:01.874
Yeah.

1248
00:53:02.004 --> 00:53:03.441
Sure. why not.

1249
00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:05.486
There's a great souvlaki
spot five minutes away.

1250
00:53:05.617 --> 00:53:06.792
Do you like Greek?

1251
00:53:06.922 --> 00:53:08.359
I love it.

1252
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:15.670
Everything OK?

1253
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:19.021
Yeah. it's just Gina got
a gift basket for the raffle

1254
00:53:19.152 --> 00:53:20.762
and wants to bring it to me.

1255
00:53:20.893 --> 00:53:22.547
Oh.

1256
00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:25.158
I'll just ask her to bring
it to us at the restaurant.

1257
00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:28.248
You know what. let's just
grab dinner another night.

1258
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:32.296
I'm sure Gina wants
to stay and chat.

1259
00:53:32.426 --> 00:53:34.733
That's what I'm afraid of.

1260
00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:37.214
I'll see ya on Monday.

1261
00:53:37.344 --> 00:53:38.215
Yeah.

1262
00:54:18.646 --> 00:54:19.517
Awe.

1263
00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:42.061
Hi.

1264
00:54:42.191 --> 00:54:44.629
You've reached Niall
with the LA Auto Expo.

1265
00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:46.413
Please leave me a message.

1266
00:54:46.544 --> 00:54:47.414
Niall. hi.

1267
00:54:47.545 --> 00:54:48.763
This is Liz Harris calling.

1268
00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:50.809
I got your number
from your nephew Pete.

1269
00:54:50.939 --> 00:54:53.725
I'm looking for a car part
for a '66 Mustang. and I

1270
00:54:53.855 --> 00:54:54.726
was hoping you could help me.

1271
00:54:54.856 --> 00:54:55.770
Thanks.

1272
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.449
Hey. Gina.

1273
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.624
Voila.

1274
00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:24.582
Isn't it terrific?

1275
00:55:24.712 --> 00:55:25.713
Wow.

1276
00:55:25.844 --> 00:55:27.280
Yeah.

1277
00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:28.760
There's even a robe in there.

1278
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:30.805
And spa slippers.

1279
00:55:30.936 --> 00:55:33.286
Again. thanks so
much for getting this.

1280
00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:36.333
And please. tell your
sister thank you as well.

1281
00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:37.508
I will.

1282
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:40.337
She'd love to meet you.

1283
00:55:40.467 --> 00:55:42.643
Actually. I'm
having a few friends

1284
00:55:42.774 --> 00:55:44.689
over tomorrow night for drinks.

1285
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:46.430
You're welcome to come.

1286
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:51.565
That's a great invitation.
but unfortunately I

1287
00:55:51.696 --> 00:55:54.394
have a project I need to finish
for my parents' anniversary.

1288
00:55:54.525 --> 00:55:55.743
That's fine.

1289
00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.441
Some other time maybe.

1290
00:55:57.571 --> 00:55:59.007
Maybe.

1291
00:55:59.138 --> 00:56:00.705
How about tonight?

1292
00:56:00.835 --> 00:56:02.010
For what?

1293
00:56:02.141 --> 00:56:06.232
Drinks and appetizers.

1294
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:10.149
You know what. tonight's
not a good night either.

1295
00:56:10.279 --> 00:56:15.023
Anniversary is coming up
quick. and I really just

1296
00:56:15.154 --> 00:56:16.634
need to finish this project.

1297
00:56:16.764 --> 00:56:18.070
Oh.

1298
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.550
All right.

1299
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.555
Well. maybe once that's
over we can find time.

1300
00:56:34.303 --> 00:56:39.439
Gina. I'm not sure
it's a good idea for us

1301
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:43.051
to meet up outside of school.

1302
00:56:43.182 --> 00:56:50.842
I like to keep my business and
personal life kind of separate.

1303
00:56:50.972 --> 00:56:52.409
Oh.

1304
00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:54.019
OK.

1305
00:56:54.149 --> 00:56:57.588
I hope that doesn't hurt
your feelings in any way.

1306
00:56:57.718 --> 00:56:59.677
No.

1307
00:56:59.807 --> 00:57:05.596
I completely understand
and respect that.

1308
00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:08.381
Thanks for dropping this off.

1309
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:09.991
I appreciate it.

1310
00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:11.036
Not a problem.

1311
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:19.131
Good night.

1312
00:57:38.324 --> 00:57:39.368
Yeah. man.

1313
00:57:39.499 --> 00:57:40.544
The tennis team's
great this year.

1314
00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:42.154
We're definitely
going all the way.

1315
00:57:42.284 --> 00:57:43.590
Ariella. hey.

1316
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:44.591
We have an issue.

1317
00:57:44.722 --> 00:57:45.505
The algorithm doesn't work.

1318
00:57:45.636 --> 00:57:46.941
What do you mean?

1319
00:57:47.072 --> 00:57:48.552
I saw Coach Packerson
and Ms. Harris sorting

1320
00:57:48.682 --> 00:57:49.988
prizes in the gym for tonight.

1321
00:57:50.118 --> 00:57:51.729
They clearly like each other.

1322
00:57:51.859 --> 00:57:55.472
They were super flirty. trying
on weird hats. and laughing.

1323
00:57:55.602 --> 00:57:56.734
I could see them together.

1324
00:57:56.864 --> 00:57:57.648
Me too.

1325
00:57:57.778 --> 00:57:59.127
And that's the problem.

1326
00:57:59.258 --> 00:58:00.520
They're both on the
website. but the algorithm

1327
00:58:00.651 --> 00:58:01.434
didn't match them.

1328
00:58:01.565 --> 00:58:02.348
Are you sure?

1329
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:04.306
Completely.

1330
00:58:04.437 --> 00:58:05.351
I'll look into it.

1331
00:58:14.012 --> 00:58:14.752
I got your text.

1332
00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:16.580
Hey. come in.

1333
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:19.452
There are some great
photos in here.

1334
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:21.976
I especially like the
ones of you and your dad.

1335
00:58:22.107 --> 00:58:24.675
He was a pretty decent
tennis player in his time.

1336
00:58:24.805 --> 00:58:25.980
Thanks so much for doing this.

1337
00:58:29.636 --> 00:58:30.855
What?

1338
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:32.683
Was there an embarrassing
photo in there?

1339
00:58:32.813 --> 00:58:35.120
I thought I pulled those out.

1340
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.295
I have a gift for you.

1341
00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:40.473
Thank you.

1342
00:58:44.085 --> 00:58:46.174
Are you serious?

1343
00:58:46.305 --> 00:58:49.395
A silver gearshift handle?

1344
00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:51.005
That's the right
one. isn't it?

1345
00:58:51.136 --> 00:58:53.617
Yes.

1346
00:58:53.747 --> 00:58:54.922
I can't believe it.

1347
00:58:55.053 --> 00:58:56.402
Where did you find this?

1348
00:58:56.533 --> 00:58:59.884
A guy in Utah had it.

1349
00:59:00.014 --> 00:59:03.714
I'm blown away that
you would do this.

1350
00:59:03.844 --> 00:59:07.413
I took the full of
surprises thing to heart.

1351
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.675
How much was it?
I'll reimburse--

1352
00:59:08.806 --> 00:59:09.633
My gift.

1353
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.117
Would you want to come
to the party with me?

1354
00:59:16.248 --> 00:59:19.381
Oh. are you sure?

1355
00:59:19.512 --> 00:59:20.774
Positive.

1356
00:59:20.905 --> 00:59:23.821
I want you to come.

1357
00:59:23.951 --> 00:59:25.866
OK.

1358
00:59:25.997 --> 00:59:27.346
Yeah. that'd be fun.

1359
00:59:27.476 --> 00:59:28.347
Great.

1360
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:53.720
You did a fantastic
job with the party.

1361
00:59:53.851 --> 00:59:55.374
And a slide show is perfect.

1362
00:59:55.504 --> 00:59:58.986
That is all Liz.

1363
00:59:59.117 --> 01:00:00.684
Happy anniversary.
Mr. Packerson.

1364
01:00:00.814 --> 01:00:01.641
Thank you. Liz.

1365
01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:03.077
We really appreciate you.

1366
01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.340
Honey. the Joneses
have just arrived.

1367
01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:06.341
Excuse us.

1368
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:14.959
Your parents are so nice.

1369
01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:18.397
They seemed to
really like you.

1370
01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:19.398
You want to sit?

1371
01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:20.442
Sure.

1372
01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:26.710
Let me get that for ya.

1373
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.886
There you go.

1374
01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:29.974
This is great. right?

1375
01:00:30.104 --> 01:00:31.018
Yeah.

1376
01:00:36.807 --> 01:00:37.895
40 years.

1377
01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:38.852
So happy you could
make it tonight.

1378
01:00:38.983 --> 01:00:39.810
Wow.
- Thank you.

1379
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.334
I know.

1380
01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.465
Kind of feel bad
my mom will never

1381
01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:45.946
experienced anything like this.

1382
01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:47.513
Your parents are divorced?

1383
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.688
Yeah.

1384
01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:50.734
My dad left when I was six.

1385
01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:52.083
I'm sorry to hear that.

1386
01:00:52.213 --> 01:00:53.258
It's fine.

1387
01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:55.216
She's better off.

1388
01:00:55.347 --> 01:01:00.265
It's hard to be with someone
that's not always honest.

1389
01:01:00.395 --> 01:01:02.180
That is true.

1390
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.575
Honesty is the most important
thing in a relationship.

1391
01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:08.360
Your mom never remarried?

1392
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:09.709
No.

1393
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.407
She raised me
completely on her own.

1394
01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:13.713
Sometimes we didn't
even have a sitter.

1395
01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:15.541
so she would take
me to work with her.

1396
01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:16.890
Where was that?

1397
01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:18.544
A bookstore.

1398
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.590
She used to get me
this beanbag chair.

1399
01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:23.070
and I would curl up
behind the counter

1400
01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:25.290
where no one could see me.

1401
01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:30.338
I swear. I read like every
book in the children's section.

1402
01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:31.905
I could see you doing that.

1403
01:01:33.298 --> 01:01:36.301
Well. she sounds
like a great mother.

1404
01:01:36.431 --> 01:01:37.345
She still is.

1405
01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:44.222
You are the
shield that kept me strong.

1406
01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:48.443
Sometimes I wish I
can take your place.

1407
01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:49.357
I like this song.

1408
01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:52.230
Me too.

1409
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.756
Would you-- you want to--

1410
01:01:56.887 --> 01:01:59.237
OK.

1411
01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:01.543
Liz. can you excuse
me for a minute?

1412
01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:03.545
I guess the chef has a
question about the cake.

1413
01:02:03.676 --> 01:02:04.416
No problem.

1414
01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:05.417
I'll be right back.

1415
01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:07.071
Take your time.

1416
01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:08.594
Oh. who said.

1417
01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:12.990
Hi.

1418
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.426
Welcome.

1419
01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:15.470
You're very handsome
in your tie. Bailey.

1420
01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:16.384
Hi.

1421
01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:17.821
Reservation for Gina.

1422
01:02:17.951 --> 01:02:19.039
Two people.

1423
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.432
My mom's treating
me to a fancy

1424
01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:21.825
dinner since I got all A's.

1425
01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:22.695
Nice.

1426
01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:23.957
OK.

1427
01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:24.958
Right this way.

1428
01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.575
You coming. mom?

1429
01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:34.925
Go ahead and
sit down. sweetie.

1430
01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:36.753
I'll be there in a minute.

1431
01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:40.757
One second
with you by my side.

1432
01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:45.196
Who said.

1433
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:50.984
Who said.

1434
01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:53.900
Who said its gotta be this way?

1435
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:55.902
Who says.

1436
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:58.600
Who said it's gonna be OK?

1437
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:04.041
Who said that time will
one day heal this pain?

1438
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:05.956
Who said?

1439
01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:06.870
Gina.

1440
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.219
Hey.

1441
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.220
I was just on my way
to the ladies room.

1442
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.876
Liz. you look really nice.

1443
01:03:13.006 --> 01:03:15.226
Are you here with Ted?

1444
01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:17.576
Yeah.

1445
01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:20.318
No. I'm not with him. with him.

1446
01:03:20.448 --> 01:03:21.710
He just invited me.

1447
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:22.668
It's not like we're
together or anything.

1448
01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:26.063
Liz. honey. come with me.

1449
01:03:26.193 --> 01:03:27.412
I'd like you to
meet our neighbors.

1450
01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:28.413
I'll see you later. Gina.

1451
01:03:46.039 --> 01:03:47.519
Oh. I had a good time.

1452
01:03:47.649 --> 01:03:48.825
Did you have a good time?

1453
01:03:48.955 --> 01:03:50.000
- I had so much.
- How about that cake?

1454
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:50.914
It was delicious.

1455
01:03:51.044 --> 01:03:52.219
Ma. you look beautiful.

1456
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.830
Thank you. sweetheart.

1457
01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:54.743
Thanks for coming. folks.

1458
01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:56.310
Happy anniversary.

1459
01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:57.355
What a wonderful party. huh?

1460
01:03:57.485 --> 01:03:59.400
All right. it was great.

1461
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.793
You know what to do.

1462
01:04:05.058 --> 01:04:08.061
Can you believe we've
been married 40 years?

1463
01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:09.019
I can't believe it.

1464
01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:10.237
Best 40 years of my life.

1465
01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:18.898
Olivia. look.

1466
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:21.074
That's a '66.

1467
01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:23.337
Someone's done a beautiful
job restoring it.

1468
01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:24.382
I was hoping you'd say that.

1469
01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:25.426
Huh?

1470
01:04:28.473 --> 01:04:30.649
Happy anniversary. sweetie.

1471
01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:32.085
Are you serious?

1472
01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:35.219
Ted spent the last year
restoring it for you.

1473
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:36.524
Oh man.

1474
01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:37.438
Thanks. champ.

1475
01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:39.179
You deserve it. Pops.

1476
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:40.180
Awe. congrats.

1477
01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:41.181
Thank you.

1478
01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:44.924
Love you. babe.

1479
01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:46.926
Oh my gosh.

1480
01:04:47.057 --> 01:04:48.101
Is it really mine?

1481
01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:49.407
It's all yours.

1482
01:04:49.537 --> 01:04:51.409
Why don't you guys
take it for a spin?

1483
01:04:51.539 --> 01:04:53.454
Liz and I can take your car.

1484
01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:54.499
Let's go. Olivia.

1485
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.377
She's a beauty.

1486
01:05:03.508 --> 01:05:05.379
Enjoy.

1487
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:06.424
He's so happy.

1488
01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:15.999
It's exactly the same.

1489
01:05:16.129 --> 01:05:16.956
I know.

1490
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:40.762
Thanks for coming.

1491
01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:42.416
My pleasure.

1492
01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:43.635
I don't think it could have
made your dad any happier

1493
01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:44.679
than he was tonight.

1494
01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:47.682
Yeah.

1495
01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.731
What?

1496
01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:53.601
Oh. good.

1497
01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:55.081
You're home.

1498
01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:56.822
I couldn't log into my
Netflix. and you said

1499
01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.215
you're gonna be on your date.

1500
01:05:58.345 --> 01:05:59.912
This isn't a date. mom.

1501
01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.696
Well. I fell asleep on the
couch and missed half of it

1502
01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:03.481
anyway.
- Ted. is it?

1503
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:04.612
Nice to meet you.

1504
01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:05.570
Betty.

1505
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.137
Nice to meet you. too.

1506
01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:09.095
Well. it looks like
you had a nice time.

1507
01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:11.706
And I don't want to interrupt.
so I'm just gonna slip right

1508
01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:13.839
past you and say goodnight.

1509
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:14.796
Love you. honey.

1510
01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:15.928
Good night.

1511
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:16.929
Night.

1512
01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:21.978
She calls everything a date.

1513
01:06:22.108 --> 01:06:23.805
Tammy and I go shopping
and it's a date.

1514
01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:24.806
Yeah.

1515
01:06:26.852 --> 01:06:31.465
I'll um-- I'll
see you on Monday.

1516
01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:32.597
Yeah.

1517
01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:33.641
Good night.

1518
01:06:50.571 --> 01:06:53.226
Liz. hi.

1519
01:06:53.357 --> 01:06:54.184
Do you have a minute?

1520
01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:55.054
Sure.

1521
01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:56.360
What's up?

1522
01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.797
It's none of my
business if you and Ted

1523
01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:00.581
are romantically involved.

1524
01:07:00.712 --> 01:07:01.974
Oh. we're not.

1525
01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:02.975
Good.

1526
01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:05.238
Again. none of my business.

1527
01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:06.892
You seem really nice.

1528
01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:10.896
And I just wanted to tell
you to be careful with him.

1529
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.203
He's not always honest.

1530
01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:14.552
About what?

1531
01:07:14.682 --> 01:07:16.554
Did he tell you he
quit the tennis club

1532
01:07:16.684 --> 01:07:18.469
to come work here with kids?

1533
01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:20.775
What do you mean?

1534
01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:23.909
Was he fired?

1535
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.954
It's amazing what
you can find online.

1536
01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:46.845
Oh. Gina was right.

1537
01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:48.151
Ted didn't quit the tennis club.

1538
01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:52.503
He was fired.
according to this blog

1539
01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:55.158
post by a previous student.

1540
01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:56.072
Well. what for?

1541
01:07:56.202 --> 01:07:57.464
It doesn't say.

1542
01:07:57.595 --> 01:07:59.336
Just he's complaining
that Ted was let go.

1543
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:06.169
So much for honesty is
the most important thing.

1544
01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:11.957
Why didn't he just tell me
that instead of making up

1545
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.611
that stuff about
inspiring students

1546
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:16.657
who wouldn't have the
opportunity otherwise?

1547
01:08:16.788 --> 01:08:19.138
Well. he obviously didn't
want you or anyone else

1548
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:20.313
to find out about it.

1549
01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:23.925
I wonder what he did.

1550
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:47.688
Why did you leave a ritzy club
to teach high school students?

1551
01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:49.081
I started to
get bored with it.

1552
01:08:57.872 --> 01:08:59.091
Remember the follow-through.

1553
01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:00.136
Good job.

1554
01:09:04.531 --> 01:09:06.272
Everybody keep doing
what you're doing.

1555
01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:08.927
You know. just do it better.

1556
01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:10.842
Liz. hey.

1557
01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.889
Hey.

1558
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.239
One more item for
the raffle came

1559
01:09:16.369 --> 01:09:18.545
through. a gift card
from that new sushi

1560
01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:20.460
place on State Street.

1561
01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.549
Want to come with me and
check it out tonight?

1562
01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.637
I got a lot of work to do.

1563
01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:25.030
Tomorrow night?

1564
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.380
Everybody says the
trashy bowls are huge.

1565
01:09:27.511 --> 01:09:29.469
Ted. I think it's
best if we focus

1566
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.908
on the rest of the
carnival stuff on our own.

1567
01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:34.953
Oh.

1568
01:09:39.914 --> 01:09:41.873
Yeah. sure.

1569
01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:16.212
I got matched with Liz?

1570
01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:26.178
There's nothing wrong
with the algorithm.

1571
01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:29.703
Ms. Harris and Coach
Packerson are a perfect match.

1572
01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:31.227
Are you sure?

1573
01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:33.185
They're both acting so weird.

1574
01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.665
I saw them in the
library. and they

1575
01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.232
completely ignored each other.

1576
01:10:36.362 --> 01:10:37.668
I kept looking at the
code. and I couldn't

1577
01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:39.365
figure out what was wrong.

1578
01:10:39.496 --> 01:10:41.237
Then this morning I decided
to look back at the history.

1579
01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:42.673
Before last night.
coach had only completed

1580
01:10:42.803 --> 01:10:44.240
half of his questions.

1581
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.111
And we set it up that
incomplete profiles

1582
01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.025
don't get matched.

1583
01:10:47.155 --> 01:10:49.027
Exactly.

1584
01:10:49.157 --> 01:10:50.724
What could have happened?

1585
01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:52.335
They were getting along so good.

1586
01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:54.250
Even the website says
they're right for each other.

1587
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:07.437
Oh.

1588
01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:08.351
Hey.

1589
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:10.222
Sorry.

1590
01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:13.094
Liz. did I do
something to upset you?

1591
01:11:13.225 --> 01:11:15.096
I'm sensing a chill.

1592
01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:17.621
I'm not upset.

1593
01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:19.536
Look. obviously we work
really well together.

1594
01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:21.494
I just think we should
keep things professional.

1595
01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:25.237
I need to get to my next class.

1596
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:26.499
I'll see you Saturday. OK?

1597
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:38.119
If Ted could lie about that.
what else is he not telling me?

1598
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.599
Well. maybe he
had a good reason.

1599
01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:40.557
For not telling the truth?

1600
01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:43.299
Is there such a thing?

1601
01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:45.953
It's a sign from the universe
that I was getting too close.

1602
01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:48.826
Maybe it's a sign that
you really like him.

1603
01:11:48.956 --> 01:11:51.002
You rarely get this upset.

1604
01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:53.221
I can't believe
you're defending him.

1605
01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:55.354
After all the lies dad told
you when you were married.

1606
01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:56.964
I saw how badly that hurt you.

1607
01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:59.837
You don't forget about that.

1608
01:11:59.967 --> 01:12:02.622
Yes. honesty in a
relationship is very important.

1609
01:12:02.753 --> 01:12:05.712
But you too aren't there yet.

1610
01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:07.497
For some people it
can be really hard

1611
01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:10.369
opening up about past
mistakes. especially to someone

1612
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.329
they're still getting to know.

1613
01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:16.549
Look. if you're honest with him
about what you've discovered.

1614
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.290
then maybe he'll be
honest with you. too.

1615
01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:24.601
Are you expecting someone?

1616
01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:25.645
No.

1617
01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:40.704
Surprise.

1618
01:12:40.834 --> 01:12:42.140
Pete. hi.

1619
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.359
- Is this your mom?
- Yes.

1620
01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:44.272
Betty.

1621
01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:45.317
Hi.

1622
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:46.536
Nice to meet you. Mrs. Harris.

1623
01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:48.320
You too.

1624
01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:51.192
I'm gonna go take care of the
food upstairs before it burns.

1625
01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.369
I hope you like alstroemerias.

1626
01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:55.283
I thought you might because
they're the same kind of flower

1627
01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:57.938
you have on your purse.

1628
01:12:58.069 --> 01:12:59.549
I love alstroemerias.

1629
01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:00.419
Thank you.

1630
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:01.942
This is so sweet.

1631
01:13:02.073 --> 01:13:03.770
I enjoyed our last date.
especially because it

1632
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:05.685
was just the two of us.

1633
01:13:05.816 --> 01:13:07.034
And I was wondering
if you wanted to see

1634
01:13:07.165 --> 01:13:10.037
a movie again this weekend?

1635
01:13:10.168 --> 01:13:16.870
Pete. this is
really sweet. but I

1636
01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:18.394
got to be honest with you.

1637
01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:20.178
Uh-oh.

1638
01:13:20.308 --> 01:13:22.528
I have a feeling you're about
to tell me I'm a great guy but--

1639
01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:26.097
You are a great
guy. but I just

1640
01:13:26.227 --> 01:13:29.100
feel like things aren't
really lining up between us.

1641
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.318
at least not for me.

1642
01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:34.410
I understand.

1643
01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:39.893
Keep them.

1644
01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:41.329
Are you sure?

1645
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.201
I'm allergic to
pretty much all flowers.

1646
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.467
I wish you the best.

1647
01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:49.468
You too.

1648
01:14:12.622 --> 01:14:14.058
I don't know what
her deal is dad.

1649
01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:15.712
So that's it.

1650
01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:17.975
She starts acting distant
and you should ignore it?

1651
01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:19.933
What do you want
me to do about it?

1652
01:14:20.064 --> 01:14:23.502
She wants it to be professional.
we'll keep it professional.

1653
01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:24.677
You seemed a
little more friendly

1654
01:14:24.808 --> 01:14:26.549
than co-workers at the party.

1655
01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:28.942
Yeah. well I'm not
some desperate puppy

1656
01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:31.902
dog that's gonna beg her to
tell me what I did wrong.

1657
01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:32.859
What?

1658
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.818
I'm not.

1659
01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:36.472
That's your pride talking.

1660
01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:40.563
Pride. self-worth. you can
call it whatever you want.

1661
01:14:40.693 --> 01:14:42.521
I did my part.

1662
01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:44.784
I asked what was wrong.

1663
01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:49.223
If she doesn't want to
tell me. that's on her.

1664
01:14:49.354 --> 01:14:50.660
So that's just it?

1665
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:52.662
Maybe she'd be a little
more open with you

1666
01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:54.794
if you were a little
more open with her.

1667
01:14:54.925 --> 01:14:57.101
I have been open.

1668
01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:59.277
So you told her straight up
that you have feelings for her?

1669
01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:03.803
No.

1670
01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:05.283
Why not?

1671
01:15:05.413 --> 01:15:07.198
Because I don't.

1672
01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:11.028
Even if I did like her.
I'm not gonna chase her.

1673
01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:12.595
That's what you said
about the tennis club.

1674
01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:16.947
That was different.

1675
01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:18.731
Was it?

1676
01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:22.039
Some things are worth
chasing and fighting for.

1677
01:15:22.169 --> 01:15:24.432
So if your pride is stopping
you from seeing those things.

1678
01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:26.304
maybe it's time to tell
your ego to step aside.

1679
01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:44.931
Do you remember
that night in California?

1680
01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:51.459
Light skies. heavy
eyes. and the truth.

1681
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.636
Do I miss you?

1682
01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:56.769
Just tell me what I know.

1683
01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.336
I can't breathe.

1684
01:15:58.466 --> 01:16:01.078
Her and me without the two.

1685
01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:56.655
Put it right down the middle.

1686
01:16:56.786 --> 01:16:57.613
There you go.

1687
01:17:05.185 --> 01:17:06.752
That's OK.

1688
01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:09.146
Rotate your shoulder.

1689
01:17:09.276 --> 01:17:10.147
OK.

1690
01:17:19.243 --> 01:17:21.375
One more.

1691
01:17:21.506 --> 01:17:23.813
Picture it going right
through the hole.

1692
01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:24.770
OK.

1693
01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:33.387
I'm just as bad at
- Skee-
- Ball as I am at tennis.

1694
01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:34.432
You know what this is?

1695
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:40.090
A charm bracelet?

1696
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.004
A luggage tag.

1697
01:17:41.134 --> 01:17:41.961
I'm pretty sure.

1698
01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:47.880
Will it help me travel through
time and not play this game?

1699
01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:49.099
You mean like all
the other people

1700
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:52.232
out there who
don't take chances?

1701
01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:56.323
It's a prize you get not
from losing but for trying.

1702
01:17:56.454 --> 01:17:58.586
It's easy to try something
you know you're good at.

1703
01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:00.850
There's no risk in that.

1704
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.330
It's a lot harder to put
yourself out there and try

1705
01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:04.810
something you're not good at.

1706
01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:05.811
It takes courage.

1707
01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:11.121
Thanks. coach.

1708
01:18:11.251 --> 01:18:13.210
Whoa.

1709
01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.864
You don't get to keep it
if you're gonna give up.

1710
01:18:14.994 --> 01:18:15.821
Huh?

1711
01:18:19.259 --> 01:18:20.130
I'm here all night.

1712
01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.177
OK.

1713
01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:25.570
Just like we talked
about on the tennis court.

1714
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:26.919
Focus on your follow-through.

1715
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.920
You got this.

1716
01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:36.581
Woo!

1717
01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.236
I did it!

1718
01:18:39.366 --> 01:18:40.672
Best throw I've
seen all night.

1719
01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:46.678
There you go.

1720
01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:54.164
Oh. could I have
the luggage tag. too?

1721
01:18:54.294 --> 01:18:55.556
Really?

1722
01:18:55.687 --> 01:18:56.601
Sure.

1723
01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:02.607
Without this one. I
wouldn't have gotten this one.

1724
01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:06.437
Good work.

1725
01:19:06.567 --> 01:19:07.438
Thanks.

1726
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.668
There's coach Packerson.

1727
01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:25.238
And there's Ms. Harris.

1728
01:19:25.369 --> 01:19:26.239
Here you go. honey.

1729
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:27.719
Are you gonna do one?

1730
01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.155
Are you ready?

1731
01:19:29.286 --> 01:19:31.244
Let's do it.

1732
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:32.680
Here you go. girls.

1733
01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:35.074
Have fun.

1734
01:19:35.205 --> 01:19:37.076
Ms. Harris. someone needs
your help at the photo booth.

1735
01:19:37.207 --> 01:19:39.339
They said it took their money
but didn't take their picture.

1736
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:40.601
Really?

1737
01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:41.515
You can go.
I'll watch your booth.

1738
01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:42.429
Thank you.

1739
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.430
Yeah.

1740
01:19:48.566 --> 01:19:49.915
- Coach.
- Hey. Dylan.

1741
01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:50.829
Having fun?

1742
01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.613
Definitely.

1743
01:19:52.744 --> 01:19:54.093
Listen. I think they need your
help over at the photo booth.

1744
01:19:54.224 --> 01:19:56.182
Someone put their money
in and it's not working.

1745
01:19:56.313 --> 01:19:57.575
I'll go check it out.

1746
01:19:57.705 --> 01:19:59.403
Mr. Perrone. can you
watch the booth for me?

1747
01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:00.752
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

1748
01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:01.753
OK.

1749
01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:12.503
Is there something
stuck in it?

1750
01:20:12.633 --> 01:20:16.289
Uh. I can't really tell.

1751
01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.726
No. nothing is stuck in there.

1752
01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.685
Maybe it's the photo paper?

1753
01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.861
Could just be the camera.

1754
01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:23.775
Do you want to try it?

1755
01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:24.689
Do you have a dollar?

1756
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:25.690
Yeah.

1757
01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:43.403
Do you know what you're doing?

1758
01:20:43.534 --> 01:20:46.058
Not really. but the guy
that delivered it said you

1759
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:49.279
could reset it like this so--

1760
01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.847
Have you tried turning
it off and turning it on?

1761
01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:52.848
No.

1762
01:21:00.943 --> 01:21:03.380
Whatever I did to
upset you. I'm sorry.

1763
01:21:06.209 --> 01:21:07.471
I've really enjoyed
spending time

1764
01:21:07.601 --> 01:21:09.168
with you these past few weeks.

1765
01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:13.042
And I started to
care about you a lot.

1766
01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:18.569
Then why did you lie to me?

1767
01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:21.137
You told me you quit
the tennis club.

1768
01:21:21.267 --> 01:21:23.530
But you were fired.

1769
01:21:23.661 --> 01:21:25.706
How did you find that out?

1770
01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:27.839
I know it's not the point.
but I'm just curious.

1771
01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.928
Gina tipped me off.

1772
01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:32.888
And I found this
blog post online.

1773
01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:36.239
When I first got here Gina
found that same blog post

1774
01:21:36.369 --> 01:21:38.328
and confronted me about it.

1775
01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:39.982
I explained everything
to her as well.

1776
01:21:40.112 --> 01:21:41.984
Well. what is
there to explain?

1777
01:21:42.114 --> 01:21:44.377
What did you do to get fired?

1778
01:21:44.508 --> 01:21:46.510
Nothing.

1779
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.427
I'd been at the club for five
years. and my students love me.

1780
01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:52.255
and I love them.

1781
01:21:52.385 --> 01:21:55.736
As a matter of fact. I built the
program up so much they decided

1782
01:21:55.867 --> 01:21:58.391
to bring on another teacher.

1783
01:21:58.522 --> 01:22:00.611
They found this guy Rick.

1784
01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:03.483
He was young.
hungry. hot off tour.

1785
01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:06.051
And they hired him.

1786
01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:07.139
OK.

1787
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:09.750
He was a great teacher.

1788
01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:11.927
He was also great
at marketing himself

1789
01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:16.801
and offering my students
classes on my off days.

1790
01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:20.065
Within a few months. my
client list had shrunk

1791
01:22:20.196 --> 01:22:21.675
and his had grown.

1792
01:22:21.806 --> 01:22:24.678
So they fired you for that?

1793
01:22:24.809 --> 01:22:27.246
Not exactly.

1794
01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:29.814
I thought they should
of had my back.

1795
01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.121
After five years
of giving my best

1796
01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:34.471
and them seeing proof
of what he was doing.

1797
01:22:34.601 --> 01:22:37.517
I thought they'd let him go.

1798
01:22:37.648 --> 01:22:41.304
They were very clear that he
was bringing in so much money.

1799
01:22:41.434 --> 01:22:44.133
they had no intention
of doing that.

1800
01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:48.485
So I quit in a
semi dramatic way.

1801
01:22:54.795 --> 01:22:56.319
So you weren't fired?

1802
01:22:56.449 --> 01:22:58.234
No.

1803
01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:00.584
But Rick made sure
everyone thought I was.

1804
01:23:00.714 --> 01:23:03.152
Why did you tell me you wanted
to teach high school kids?

1805
01:23:03.282 --> 01:23:04.892
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

1806
01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:06.372
I didn't want you to
think I was a subpar

1807
01:23:06.503 --> 01:23:08.722
teacher. that all
the students would

1808
01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:10.159
rather learn from Rick than me.

1809
01:23:10.289 --> 01:23:11.638
Please.

1810
01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:13.423
I've seen you with these kids.

1811
01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:16.078
You're an incredible teacher.

1812
01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:18.602
True.

1813
01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:22.258
But you wouldn't have
known that four weeks ago.

1814
01:23:22.388 --> 01:23:23.824
I could tell in
the staff meeting

1815
01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:27.872
that you were hoping someone
else would volunteer.

1816
01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:31.006
I'm really sorry about that.

1817
01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:33.878
You turned out to be a way
better partner than I expected.

1818
01:23:37.795 --> 01:23:39.623
And I'm also sorry
about that guy Rick

1819
01:23:39.753 --> 01:23:41.146
and what he did to you.

1820
01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:43.148
You know what?

1821
01:23:43.279 --> 01:23:45.498
I'm not.

1822
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:47.413
I love the students
here so much.

1823
01:23:47.544 --> 01:23:54.203
And looking back. it wasn't
completely Rick's fault.

1824
01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.727
I'd become complacent.

1825
01:23:56.857 --> 01:23:59.512
Part of me felt I
was so good that I

1826
01:23:59.643 --> 01:24:01.514
didn't need to try anymore.

1827
01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:02.863
I don't buy that.

1828
01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:07.042
You are the most
competitive person I know.

1829
01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:11.611
Being competitive and trying
to win. that's one thing.

1830
01:24:11.742 --> 01:24:14.745
Fighting for what you want and
being willing to put your ego

1831
01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:17.400
aside. that's something else.

1832
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.406
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you what really happened.

1833
01:24:23.536 --> 01:24:26.583
I should have been honest and
let you form your own opinion.

1834
01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:31.718
Well. my opinion of you
wouldn't have changed because I

1835
01:24:31.849 --> 01:24:38.073
would still think you
were annoying and cocky

1836
01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:44.992
but someone who I've really
enjoyed spending time with.

1837
01:24:45.123 --> 01:24:46.037
Yeah.

1838
01:25:02.271 --> 01:25:03.141
Oh my gosh.

1839
01:25:06.536 --> 01:25:08.015
That's hilarious.

1840
01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:09.147
You think they're hearing us?

1841
01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:12.933
I guess it's working now.

1842
01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:18.417
There was never a problem
with it. wasn't there?

1843
01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:19.549
Sorry. I got to take this.

1844
01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:20.593
That's my mom.

1845
01:25:30.081 --> 01:25:34.041
Since we're being
honest. I have not been

1846
01:25:34.172 --> 01:25:36.957
able to get you out of my mind.

1847
01:25:37.088 --> 01:25:38.220
What about Pete?

1848
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:40.222
I ended that.

1849
01:25:40.352 --> 01:25:41.484
Pete's a really nice guy.

1850
01:25:41.614 --> 01:25:44.313
He's just not what
I was looking for.

1851
01:25:44.443 --> 01:25:47.316
What are you looking for?

1852
01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:53.017
Someone who's smart and
athletic and funny. sweet.

1853
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.367
athletic.

1854
01:25:55.498 --> 01:25:56.586
You said athletic twice.

1855
01:25:56.716 --> 01:25:58.065
Did I?

1856
01:25:58.196 --> 01:25:59.197
Yeah.

1857
01:25:59.328 --> 01:26:00.155
Gina.

1858
01:26:02.983 --> 01:26:06.378
I just came over here to
apologize for any problems

1859
01:26:06.509 --> 01:26:08.250
I might have caused.

1860
01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:09.599
I was watching from over there.

1861
01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:14.081
And I always thought
we had chemistry.

1862
01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:16.997
but it's pretty clear
you have it with Liz.

1863
01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:24.135
Apology accepted.

1864
01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:26.442
Great job on all of this.

1865
01:26:26.572 --> 01:26:27.486
Thanks.

1866
01:26:27.617 --> 01:26:28.531
Thanks. Gina.

1867
01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:29.575
Yeah.

1868
01:26:38.236 --> 01:26:39.716
Should we take a
little walk around. make

1869
01:26:39.846 --> 01:26:41.239
sure everything's going OK?

1870
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:42.632
It's a carnival.

1871
01:26:42.762 --> 01:26:44.024
What could possibly go wrong?

1872
01:26:53.947 --> 01:26:56.472
I'm so sorry.

1873
01:26:56.602 --> 01:26:58.474
It's OK.

1874
01:26:58.604 --> 01:27:00.693
Oh.

1875
01:27:00.824 --> 01:27:02.173
What's your name?

1876
01:27:02.304 --> 01:27:04.567
I'm Gina. one of
the teachers here.

1877
01:27:04.697 --> 01:27:07.309
I'm here with my son Bailey.

1878
01:27:07.439 --> 01:27:08.875
Pete.

1879
01:27:09.006 --> 01:27:10.660
I'm here with my nephew.

1880
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:13.489
He's spent the last half hour
throwing darts at balloons.

1881
01:27:13.619 --> 01:27:16.013
Well. I was just headed
to that booth myself.

1882
01:27:16.143 --> 01:27:18.755
Can I walk you?

1883
01:27:18.885 --> 01:27:19.756
Definitely.

1884
01:27:19.886 --> 01:27:21.540
OK.

1885
01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:22.889
So you're a teacher here?

1886
01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.195
Yeah.

1887
01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:25.152
Might have to buy
you more popcorn.

1888
01:27:29.722 --> 01:27:31.028
Want me to win you a bear?

1889
01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:32.203
Really?

1890
01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:34.161
What if I wanted
to win you a bear?

1891
01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:36.686
I have no doubt
that you could.

1892
01:27:36.816 --> 01:27:39.079
Let's just split
an ice cream instead.

1893
01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:39.993
What flavor?

1894
01:27:40.124 --> 01:27:41.168
Strawberry.

1895
01:27:41.299 --> 01:27:42.257
Strawberry?

1896
01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:43.693
That's my favorite.

1897
01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:45.651
Another thing
we have in common.

1898
01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:47.131
Like traveling.

1899
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.872
And maple fritters.

1900
01:27:49.002 --> 01:27:49.960
You like those. too?

1901
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:51.004
Yes.

1902
01:27:53.703 --> 01:27:56.009
Drinking a good syrah
and teaching kids.

1903
01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.273
Not at the same
time. of course.

1904
01:27:58.403 --> 01:27:59.274
No.

1905
01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.281
I think we make a good match.

1906
01:28:06.411 --> 01:28:11.024
So do I. I've got a little
surprise for you outside.

1907
01:28:11.155 --> 01:28:12.069
Let's check it out.

1908
01:28:17.553 --> 01:28:19.250
Pretty good turnout.

1909
01:28:19.381 --> 01:28:22.862
Not bad for our
first carnival.

1910
01:28:22.993 --> 01:28:24.211
So what did you want to show me?

1911
01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:25.256
Look up.

1912
01:28:32.045 --> 01:28:33.395
Surprise.

1913
01:28:33.525 --> 01:28:34.396
Oh!

1914
01:28:56.809 --> 01:28:59.421
This is the perfect ending.

1915
01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:02.206
Or maybe it's
just the beginning.
