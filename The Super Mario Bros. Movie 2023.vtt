Luigi. this is our chance.

183
00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:31.617
Destiny is calling.

184
00:13:31.617 --> 00:13:33.850
Destiny Del Vecchio
from high school?

185
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.159
What? No.

186
00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:37.161
- Just come on.

187
00:13:38.494 --> 00:13:41.528
It's more than
the storm drains can handle!

188
00:13:42.564 --> 00:13:45.235
Come on! We got to pump it!

189
00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:50.636
I got this.

190
00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.376
They're not even looking
in the right place.

191
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.114
Come on. Lu.

192
00:14:04.487 --> 00:14:06.718
You are not seriously considering...

193
00:14:06.718 --> 00:14:07.994
Mario!

194
00:14:16.972 --> 00:14:19.940
We got to get
to that pressure valve.

195
00:14:21.942 --> 00:14:24.274
Mamma mia.

196
00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:52.863
Uh...

197
00:15:02.743 --> 00:15:06.580
I knew saving Brooklyn
was a bad idea.

198
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.186
Come on.

199
00:15:14.854 --> 00:15:16.293
Whoa.

200
00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:21.067
What is this place?

201
00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:53.990
Looks like nobody's
been down here for years.

202
00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:57.466
Luigi?

203
00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:01.602
Luigi. are you in there?

204
00:16:07.478 --> 00:16:09.610
Luigi!

205
00:16:11.713 --> 00:16:13.779
What?

206
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:35.273
Whoa.

207
00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:45.085
Luigi!

208
00:16:45.085 --> 00:16:47.483
Mario!

209
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.487
Give me your hand!

210
00:16:51.487 --> 00:16:53.159
It's all gonna be okay!

211
00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:54.523
How is this gonna be okay?

212
00:16:54.523 --> 00:16:56.558
I'm telling you.
nothing can hurt us

213
00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.263
as long as we're together.

214
00:17:00.694 --> 00:17:03.235
Mario!

215
00:17:04.062 --> 00:17:06.865
Luigi!

216
00:17:42.903 --> 00:17:44.540
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

217
00:17:46.344 --> 00:17:49.105
Oh. I'm sorry.
That one's perfectly fine.

218
00:17:49.105 --> 00:17:50.645
That's a little mushroom man.

219
00:17:50.645 --> 00:17:52.482
A little mushroom man
talking to me.

220
00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:53.945
Pleased to meet you.

221
00:17:53.945 --> 00:17:55.848
I'm Toad.

222
00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:58.257
Uh. Mario.

223
00:18:00.492 --> 00:18:03.262
So this is. uh... this is...
this is not a dream?

224
00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:04.989
- That hurt. right?

225
00:18:04.989 --> 00:18:07.299
- Yes!
- Definitely not a dream.

226
00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:09.862
Then it's... this place is...

227
00:18:09.862 --> 00:18:12.832
The Mushroom Kingdom!

228
00:18:12.832 --> 00:18:14.438
Mushrooms? Really?

229
00:18:14.438 --> 00:18:17.309
Now. that is
a cruel twist of fate.

230
00:18:22.173 --> 00:18:23.975
Hello.

231
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.483
Yeah. I'm actually looking
for somebody.

232
00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:27.979
Uh. my brother. in fact.

233
00:18:27.979 --> 00:18:31.015
He looks exactly like me
but tall and skinny and green.

234
00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:33.655
See. last time I saw him. he...
he was falling through a pipe.

235
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.086
It was foggy. and...
and I believe there was lava.

236
00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:39.463
Uh. that is not good.

237
00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:41.597
Um. your brother

238
00:18:41.597 --> 00:18:44.127
has landed in the Dark Lands.

239
00:18:44.127 --> 00:18:45.304
They're under...

240
00:18:45.304 --> 00:18:47.240
Bowser's control.

241
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.670
Bowser?

242
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.641
He's the most evil.
wretched creature alive.

243
00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:57.415
I'm taking you
to see the princess.

244
00:18:57.415 --> 00:18:59.549
She can help you.

245
00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:01.144
She can do anything.

246
00:19:01.144 --> 00:19:03.146
Princess?

247
00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.328
Come on. Mario!

248
00:19:09.328 --> 00:19:11.429
Our big adventure begins now!

249
00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:13.057
Hang on. Luigi.

250
00:19:40.218 --> 00:19:43.494
Mario? Mario?

251
00:19:43.494 --> 00:19:45.331
Where are you?

252
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:46.464
Huh?

253
00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:26.438
Oh.

254
00:20:26.438 --> 00:20:29.166
Yes!

255
00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.707
You just got a-Luigi'd.

256
00:21:48.555 --> 00:21:49.884
This way. Mario.

257
00:21:49.884 --> 00:21:52.887
The princess lives
right on that hill.

258
00:22:01.027 --> 00:22:02.864
Excuse me. everybody.
Coming through.

259
00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:04.800
Got a big adventure
happening right now.

260
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.065
Just clear a path for us.

261
00:22:06.065 --> 00:22:07.671
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

262
00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:08.969
Excuse me.

263
00:22:08.969 --> 00:22:11.136
Excuse me. everybody!
Coming through!

264
00:22:11.136 --> 00:22:14.678
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

265
00:22:14.678 --> 00:22:16.240
Out of the way. please!

266
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.780
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

267
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.144
He's gonna be fine.

268
00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:20.376
- Chanterelle.
- Morning.

269
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:22.081
- Nice to see you. bud.

270
00:22:24.116 --> 00:22:25.491
Does this thing work?

271
00:22:25.491 --> 00:22:26.723
Yes. works great.

272
00:22:26.723 --> 00:22:28.890
You just have to blow into it.

273
00:22:29.728 --> 00:22:31.497
And up we go.

274
00:22:31.497 --> 00:22:33.323
Wait. up?

275
00:22:51.814 --> 00:22:55.785
Whoa. Okay. so these bricks
are just floating here? Uh...

276
00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:57.787
Just pop in this pipe.
and we're on our way.

277
00:22:57.787 --> 00:22:58.986
Oh.

278
00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.691
- It's the only way to fly. man.

279
00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:05.388
Oh. wow.
Love these pi...

280
00:23:11.638 --> 00:23:12.802
Whoo!

281
00:23:19.074 --> 00:23:20.073
Huh?

282
00:23:26.345 --> 00:23:28.246
Oh. come on.

283
00:23:32.382 --> 00:23:34.252
Here we are. Palace doors.

284
00:23:34.252 --> 00:23:36.089
Bing. bang. boom.

285
00:23:37.829 --> 00:23:39.631
Come on!

286
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:41.061
Whoo!

287
00:23:41.061 --> 00:23:43.063
Whoa.

288
00:23:47.804 --> 00:23:51.577
Pretty impressive. am I right?

289
00:23:54.472 --> 00:23:56.582
Hold it right there. you two.

290
00:23:56.582 --> 00:23:59.343
Oh. hey.
I need to see the princess.

291
00:23:59.343 --> 00:24:00.916
It's an emergency.

292
00:24:02.821 --> 00:24:04.018
What princess?

293
00:24:04.018 --> 00:24:06.053
I never heard of any princess.

294
00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:07.219
Oh. wait. I did.

295
00:24:07.219 --> 00:24:09.452
Our princess. though.
is in another castle.

296
00:24:09.452 --> 00:24:10.794
Oh. yeah. That's right.

297
00:24:10.794 --> 00:24:12.796
You should try
another castle. maybe.

298
00:24:12.796 --> 00:24:14.963
She ain't in this one.

299
00:24:14.963 --> 00:24:15.997
Huh?

300
00:24:15.997 --> 00:24:17.537
Okay. so they're
messing with you.

301
00:24:17.537 --> 00:24:19.539
and I don't like it.

302
00:24:23.204 --> 00:24:25.270
What do you guys. um...
What do you want to eat?

303
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.239
Anything...
anything your hearts desire.

304
00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:28.075
Go.

305
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:30.715
I am ready to scramble it up.

306
00:24:38.217 --> 00:24:40.351
Hey! Intruder!

307
00:24:40.351 --> 00:24:41.660
- Stop him!

308
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.255
- Intruder!

309
00:24:43.255 --> 00:24:45.092
- Stop him!
- Stop him!

310
00:24:45.092 --> 00:24:47.292
Now! Stop him!

311
00:25:01.715 --> 00:25:03.715
Council. your attention.

312
00:25:03.715 --> 00:25:05.750
Bowser has found the Super Star

313
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.280
and is headed
toward our kingdom.

314
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.591
Its power will make him invincible.

315
00:25:11.591 --> 00:25:13.593
We will be destroyed.

316
00:25:15.518 --> 00:25:17.960
Princess. what are we gonna do?

317
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.062
I will not let him hurt you.

318
00:25:26.036 --> 00:25:29.169
We are going to stop Bowser.

319
00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:30.676
How? Look at us.

320
00:25:30.676 --> 00:25:32.238
We're adorable.

321
00:25:32.238 --> 00:25:36.440
I'm going to convince
the great Kong army to help us.

322
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.146
Together. we'll annihilate
that monster.

323
00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:41.819
Their mad king
doesn't make alliances.

324
00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:44.349
The Kongs will never agree.

325
00:25:44.349 --> 00:25:46.054
I can convince him.

326
00:25:46.054 --> 00:25:48.925
I'll leave for the
Jungle Kingdom in the morning.

327
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.666
Good luck. Princess.
for all our sakes.

328
00:26:02.105 --> 00:26:06.437
Princess!

329
00:26:10.718 --> 00:26:12.377
Princess. Hi...

330
00:26:14.852 --> 00:26:17.316
Wait. Release him.

331
00:26:19.155 --> 00:26:21.584
Whoa.

332
00:26:21.584 --> 00:26:23.729
Are you...

333
00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:26.622
He's a human!

334
00:26:26.622 --> 00:26:28.096
I mean. you are a human. right?

335
00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:29.966
It's just.
you're so small and...

336
00:26:29.966 --> 00:26:31.330
- Hey.
- Wait. wait. wait.

337
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.233
Let-let's go back.
Where did you come from?

338
00:26:33.233 --> 00:26:35.708
Uh. me and my little brother Luigi.

339
00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:37.270
we-we fell down this pipe.

340
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.240
And now he's lost s-somewhere
in the Dark Lands.

341
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.815
Then it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

342
00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:45.751
But you're in luck.

343
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:47.511
I'm on my way to stop him.

344
00:26:47.511 --> 00:26:48.787
Well. take me with you.

345
00:26:48.787 --> 00:26:51.856
This guy's a lunatic. a psycho.

346
00:26:51.856 --> 00:26:54.760
He will eat you for breakfast.

347
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.223
He won't even notice it. probably.

348
00:26:56.223 --> 00:26:59.061
'cause you're very. very small.

349
00:26:59.061 --> 00:27:00.964
You know what?
Make fun of me all you want.

350
00:27:00.964 --> 00:27:03.131
but you are gonna help me
find my brother.

351
00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:06.002
Please?

352
00:27:07.302 --> 00:27:08.367
Well. okay.

353
00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:10.468
Let's see what you're made of.

354
00:27:11.537 --> 00:27:13.108
Is that a yes?

355
00:27:13.108 --> 00:27:16.177
No. that's a "let's see
what you're made of."

356
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.899
If you can finish this.
you're coming with me.

357
00:28:07.899 --> 00:28:09.428
Watch and learn.

358
00:28:34.717 --> 00:28:36.290
Hi-yah!

359
00:28:52.638 --> 00:28:54.308
That was amazing.

360
00:28:54.308 --> 00:28:56.915
Wait. How-how am I
supposed to do that?

361
00:28:56.915 --> 00:28:58.345
With the Power-Ups.

362
00:28:58.345 --> 00:29:01.084
They give us special abilities.

363
00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:05.055
Ugh. Really?

364
00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:06.925
Go on. Eat it.

365
00:29:11.723 --> 00:29:13.162
Now. this has to be a mushroom?

366
00:29:13.162 --> 00:29:15.659
'Cause I just hate
mushrooms and...

367
00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:17.100
Okay. okay.

368
00:29:18.398 --> 00:29:20.664
Are you sure
there's not. like. a...

369
00:29:20.664 --> 00:29:21.874
- Down the hatch.
-  Ow.

370
00:29:21.874 --> 00:29:23.634
Yep. there it is. and all gone.

371
00:29:25.042 --> 00:29:27.374
Oh. not cool.

372
00:29:27.374 --> 00:29:28.804
Uh...

373
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.379
Huh?

374
00:29:41.588 --> 00:29:42.961
Whoa-oh-oh!

375
00:29:42.961 --> 00:29:45.260
- I'm tall.
- And strong.

376
00:29:47.825 --> 00:29:49.297
And you can jump.

377
00:29:49.297 --> 00:29:51.332
Oh. I got this.

378
00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:53.070
No problem.

379
00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:56.205
Woo-hoo!

380
00:30:04.081 --> 00:30:06.314
- Oh. yeah.

381
00:30:06.314 --> 00:30:09.614
When you get hit.
you lose the power.

382
00:30:11.123 --> 00:30:13.519
Great.

383
00:30:15.655 --> 00:30:17.424

No one gets it right away.

405
00:31:39.143 --> 00:31:40.903

00:31:40.903 --> 00:31:43.345
Oh. so many.

407
00:31:43.345 --> 00:31:45.215
I was not good at it.

408
00:31:45.215 --> 00:31:46.942
Worse than you.

409
00:31:46.942 --> 00:31:48.449
You got it right away.
didn't you?

410
00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:50.715
I got it right away.
but I grew up here.

411
00:31:50.715 --> 00:31:53.520
Okay. now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

412
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.127
No. No.

413
00:31:57.064 --> 00:32:00.032
- Is it working?
- A little bit. Yeah.

414
00:32:29.954 --> 00:32:31.360
My army!

415
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.296
- Koopas.
- Yeah!

416
00:32:33.296 --> 00:32:34.726
- Goombas.

417
00:32:34.726 --> 00:32:36.860
- Whatever those things are.

418
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.698
After years of searching
for the Super Star.

419
00:32:39.698 --> 00:32:42.206
- it is finally ours!
Yeah!

420
00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:45.704
I am now the most powerful
turtle in the world!

421
00:32:45.704 --> 00:32:47.145
Yeah!

422
00:32:47.145 --> 00:32:49.939
Soon. we will arrive
at the Mushroom Kingdom.

423
00:32:49.939 --> 00:32:51.248
Yeah!

424
00:32:51.248 --> 00:32:53.679
Where. after years
of being sworn enemies.

425
00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:56.187
I will ask their princess
to marry me

426
00:32:56.187 --> 00:32:58.222
in a fairy-tale wedding!

427
00:32:58.222 --> 00:32:59.817
Yeah!

428
00:32:59.817 --> 00:33:01.291
- Eh?

429
00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:03.194
Yeah.

430
00:33:03.194 --> 00:33:05.229
Did he say marry their princess?

431
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:06.923
Doesn't she hate you?

432
00:33:06.923 --> 00:33:09.134
Of course she hates me.

433
00:33:09.134 --> 00:33:11.796
But that makes me love her
all the more.

434
00:33:11.796 --> 00:33:13.963
Her heart-shaped bangs.

435
00:33:13.963 --> 00:33:16.339
the way she floats
in the breeze.

436
00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:18.572
her immovable tiara.

437
00:33:18.572 --> 00:33:20.574
And when she sees this star...

438
00:33:20.574 --> 00:33:23.808
oh. wedding bells.

439
00:33:23.808 --> 00:33:26.349
Well. what if she says no?

440
00:33:28.353 --> 00:33:30.122
Then I will power up
with this star

441
00:33:30.122 --> 00:33:31.948
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

442
00:33:31.948 --> 00:33:33.389
Yeah!

443
00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:36.095
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

444
00:33:36.095 --> 00:33:38.757
It's gonna rock!

445
00:34:48.334 --> 00:34:50.664
They're all counting on us.

446
00:34:50.664 --> 00:34:52.270
No pressure.

447
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.209
Huh?

448
00:35:03.844 --> 00:35:08.418
My Toads. our days of terror
are almost over.

449
00:35:08.418 --> 00:35:11.520
With the help of the Kong army.
we will stop...

450
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.358
Uh. who's he?

451
00:35:16.956 --> 00:35:19.264
He's not important!

452
00:35:35.711 --> 00:35:36.809
Nervous?

453
00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:38.316
Who? Me?

454
00:35:38.316 --> 00:35:40.109

What?

484
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.771
A report from our intelligence.

485
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:47.808
A mustachioed human has arrived
in the Mushroom Kingdom.

486
00:37:49.348 --> 00:37:51.482
The princess has been
training him.

487
00:37:51.482 --> 00:37:53.913
They are up to something. sire.

488
00:37:56.313 --> 00:37:57.785
Sit.

489
00:37:58.887 --> 00:38:00.359
Jam with me.

490
00:38:03.694 --> 00:38:07.564
This. uh. human.
where did he come from?

491
00:38:07.564 --> 00:38:10.369
We... aren't sure.

492
00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:12.470
Does the princess like him?

493
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.605
Oh. sire. Look in the mirror.

494
00:38:15.605 --> 00:38:17.970
You have nothing to worry about.

495
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.006
I know that. I'm not threatened.

496
00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:27.111
Find out who he is
and what they're planning!

497
00:38:27.111 --> 00:38:29.619
I'm on it. sire.

498
00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:31.786
May I lift the cover?

499
00:38:31.786 --> 00:38:32.886
Not yet.

500
00:38:32.886 --> 00:38:35.427
- Pain is the best teacher.

501
00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:47.131
Thinking about your brother?

502
00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:49.738
We've never been apart
this long.

503
00:38:49.738 --> 00:38:52.675
Don't worry.
We're going to save him.

504
00:39:08.726 --> 00:39:11.430
You don't seem like
you're from here.

505
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.191
I don't know where I'm from.

506
00:39:14.191 --> 00:39:15.225
Really?

507
00:39:15.225 --> 00:39:16.567
Yep.

508
00:39:16.567 --> 00:39:19.669
My earliest memory is arriving.

509
00:39:26.546 --> 00:39:28.645
<i>I was so lucky they found me.</i>

510
00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:30.581
<i>They took me in.</i>

511
00:39:32.308 --> 00:39:34.486
<i>Raised me like
one of their own.</i>

512
00:39:34.486 --> 00:39:36.521
<i>And when I was ready...</i>

513
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.086
<i>...they made me their princess.</i>

514
00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:47.257
Hey. maybe you're from my world.

515
00:39:48.898 --> 00:39:51.734
There's a huge universe
out there

516
00:39:51.734 --> 00:39:54.605
with a lot of galaxies.

517
00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:40.552
We found him in the Dark Lands.

518
00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:47.284
Leave him to me.

519
00:40:56.766 --> 00:40:58.262
What is your name?

520
00:40:58.262 --> 00:41:00.495
Uh. Luigi.

521
00:41:01.804 --> 00:41:03.498
Not sure if you know who I am.

522
00:41:03.498 --> 00:41:07.139
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

523
00:41:07.977 --> 00:41:09.504
Wow. uh...

524
00:41:09.504 --> 00:41:10.813
Yay.

525
00:41:10.813 --> 00:41:14.685
But there's one problem. Luigi.

526
00:41:14.685 --> 00:41:17.820
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

527
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.823
Has a mustache. just like you.

528
00:41:20.823 --> 00:41:22.726
Do you know him?

529
00:41:22.726 --> 00:41:24.761
No. No.

530
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:27.027
Ah. a tough one. I see.

531
00:41:27.027 --> 00:41:28.633
Maybe this will get you
to talk.

532
00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:30.833
Do you think I know

533
00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:31.933
every human being
with a mustache

534
00:41:31.933 --> 00:41:33.363
wearing an identical outfit

535
00:41:33.363 --> 00:41:35.772
with a hat with the letter
of his first name on it?

536
00:41:35.772 --> 00:41:37.367
- Because I don't.

537
00:41:38.907 --> 00:41:40.810
- Do you know him?!
- Stop!

538
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.746
Stop. stop. stop. stop.
I know him.

539
00:41:42.746 --> 00:41:44.946
Yes. I know him.
Yeah. he's my brother Mario.

540
00:41:44.946 --> 00:41:47.586
and he's the best guy
in the world.

541
00:41:47.586 --> 00:41:50.050
Do princesses
find him attractive?

542
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.789
They do if they have good taste!

543
00:41:54.692 --> 00:41:56.122
Get him out of my sight!

544
00:41:56.122 --> 00:41:58.256
We'll see how tough
this Mario is

545
00:41:58.256 --> 00:42:00.830
when he watches me
kill his brother!

546
00:42:13.304 --> 00:42:15.339
Where am I?

547
00:42:19.312 --> 00:42:20.575
Home.

548
00:42:20.575 --> 00:42:23.017
Pay him no heed.

549
00:42:23.789 --> 00:42:26.581
He is cute. but he is...

550
00:42:26.581 --> 00:42:30.794
In an insane world. it is
the sane who is called crazy.

551
00:42:35.526 --> 00:42:37.130
How long you guys been in here?

552
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:41.035
Time. like hope. is an illusion.

553
00:42:41.035 --> 00:42:42.938
Please!
We are depressed enough!

554
00:42:42.938 --> 00:42:45.743
There's got to be
a way out of here.

555
00:42:45.743 --> 00:42:47.107
There is no escape.

556
00:42:47.107 --> 00:42:50.407
The only hope is
the sweet relief of death.

557
00:42:52.112 --> 00:42:54.477
Oh. you've got to be kidding me.

558
00:43:18.338 --> 00:43:19.568
You ready?

559
00:43:19.568 --> 00:43:21.372

Without your help.

588

will be annihilated.

The answer is no. Goodbye.

688
00:53:01.919 --> 00:53:06.429
He's gonna arrive at the
Mushroom Kingdom by sundown.

689
00:53:06.429 --> 00:53:10.191
Lucky for you guys.
I got a shortcut.

690

00:56:54.657 --> 00:56:56.450
Is there anything like this

730
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:58.419
- in your world?

731
00:56:58.419 --> 00:56:59.827
No.

732
00:56:59.827 --> 00:57:01.763
We don't drive on rainbows.

733
00:57:01.763 --> 00:57:03.457
What are you gonna tell me next?

734
00:57:03.457 --> 00:57:05.668
That the turtles aren't evil?

735
00:57:05.668 --> 00:57:07.934
No. no. They're usually pets.

736
00:57:07.934 --> 00:57:09.133
No way.

737
00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:11.168
Ah. come to Brooklyn.
I'll buy you a turtle.

738
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:13.940
Maybe I will.

739
00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.239
- Dude. is this you flirting?

740
00:57:16.239 --> 00:57:17.713
This is painful.

741
00:57:17.713 --> 00:57:19.407
Just-- I was trying to be nice.

742
00:57:19.407 --> 00:57:20.683
You are so embarrassing.

743
00:57:20.683 --> 00:57:22.520
A princess would never
go out with you.

744
00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.050
Yes. she would.
I guarantee she would.

745
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.151
Guys. enough.

746
00:57:27.151 --> 00:57:29.120
All right. all right.

747
00:57:37.636 --> 00:57:39.702
Attack!

748
00:57:48.469 --> 00:57:50.075
It's an ambush!

749
00:57:52.913 --> 00:57:55.179
Defensive positions!

750
00:58:10.735 --> 00:58:12.702
Mario. you're a dead man.

751
00:58:16.202 --> 00:58:18.235
Split up!

752
00:58:20.437 --> 00:58:22.107
Mario!

753
00:58:43.702 --> 00:58:45.702
- Whoa!

754
00:58:47.264 --> 00:58:49.002
Whoa.

755
00:59:38.381 --> 00:59:40.922
I'm too cute to die!

756
00:59:49.898 --> 00:59:52.868
That is how you princess!

757
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.508
Time to die. Mario.

758
01:00:23.659 --> 01:00:24.834
Ow!

759
01:00:27.432 --> 01:00:29.564
- See ya!

760
01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:31.005
No!

761
01:00:34.472 --> 01:00:36.571
Woo-hoo!

762
01:00:36.571 --> 01:00:38.342
Yeah!

763
01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:47.791
You can't escape me.

764
01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:48.891
What?

765
01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:51.861
Blue shell!

766
01:01:06.172 --> 01:01:08.174
No!

767
01:01:08.174 --> 01:01:09.978
No. Mario.

768
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.608
Aah! No.

769
01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:14.752
No!

770
01:01:14.752 --> 01:01:16.886
Whoa!

771
01:01:19.682 --> 01:01:22.859
Get your clown claws off of me!

772
01:01:25.653 --> 01:01:27.765
Goodbye. Mario.

773
01:01:27.765 --> 01:01:30.196
We have to get home.

774
01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.568
Hey. this is your fault!

775
01:01:39.568 --> 01:01:41.570
- My fault? You're the one who...
- Stop talking!

776
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.782
I don't want the last thing
I hear before I die

777
01:01:44.782 --> 01:01:46.378
to be your...

778
01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:19.080
Mario. you saved my life.

779
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.247
Yeah. well. I won't tell anyone.

780
01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:22.820
Good. Please don't.

781
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.052
Okay.

782
01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:29.255
Uh. did you just feel something?

783
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.061
Swim!

784
01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:51.079
Bowser's on his way.

785
01:02:51.079 --> 01:02:52.883
You have to evacuate.

786
01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:58.449
Hurry. Get out of the city!

787
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.463
Princess?

788
01:03:12.463 --> 01:03:14.168
We lost the army.

789
01:03:14.168 --> 01:03:16.665
- And Mario's gone.

790
01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:20.372
Bowser is coming.

791
01:03:20.372 --> 01:03:23.177
Head into the forest.
I'll buy you some time.

792
01:03:23.177 --> 01:03:25.575
You heard her.
Evacuate the city.

793
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:29.084
Go with the others.

794
01:03:29.084 --> 01:03:31.988
I said I wouldn't let
anyone hurt you.

795
01:03:36.456 --> 01:03:37.356
Run!

796
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:43.934
Just leave it. There's no time.

797
01:04:38.914 --> 01:04:40.848
Princess Peach.

798
01:04:40.848 --> 01:04:43.059
Brave as ever.

799
01:04:44.997 --> 01:04:49.032
As you can see.
I have the Super Star.

800
01:04:49.032 --> 01:04:53.399
If you're going to use it.
use it now.

801
01:04:55.896 --> 01:04:57.370
No. Princess.

802
01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:59.768
I stole this star for us.

803
01:04:59.768 --> 01:05:03.442
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

804
01:05:06.744 --> 01:05:08.810
I told you that line
wouldn't work.

805
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.581
You're doing great.

806
01:05:10.581 --> 01:05:15.256
Peaches. with this star.
we will be invincible.

807
01:05:15.256 --> 01:05:19.788
We can rule the world
together forever.

808
01:05:19.788 --> 01:05:21.691
Will you marry me?

809
01:05:21.691 --> 01:05:23.198
Marry you?

810
01:05:23.198 --> 01:05:24.859
Are you insane?

811
01:05:24.859 --> 01:05:26.960
I would never marry you.

812
01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.799
Maybe you should reconsider.

813
01:05:32.603 --> 01:05:33.802
No!

814
01:05:33.802 --> 01:05:35.177
Stop!

815
01:05:37.014 --> 01:05:38.246
Please stop.

816
01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:39.412
I'll... I'll-I'll marry you.

817
01:05:39.412 --> 01:05:41.315
Just don't hurt my Toads.

818
01:05:46.122 --> 01:05:48.157
You have my word.

819
01:05:55.232 --> 01:05:57.958
Time for a wedding!

820
01:06:10.379 --> 01:06:12.313
♪ Life is sad ♪

821
01:06:12.313 --> 01:06:14.117
♪ Prison is sad ♪

822
01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:19.012
♪ Life in prison
is very. very sad. ♪

823
01:06:25.326 --> 01:06:28.428
Ooh. fresh meat for the grinder.

824
01:06:28.428 --> 01:06:31.068
Who's this ray of sunshine?

825
01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:34.137
There's no sunshine.
only darkness.

826
01:06:34.137 --> 01:06:36.172
Shut up. shut up. shut up!

827
01:06:36.172 --> 01:06:38.438
Hello. prisoners.

828
01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:40.275
You don't deserve this.

829
01:06:40.275 --> 01:06:43.476
but you're invited
to the royal wedding!

830
01:06:43.476 --> 01:06:45.280
Yay!

831
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.350
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed!

832
01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:53.651
Oh. no. no. no.

833
01:06:53.651 --> 01:06:56.049
Finally. mercy.

834
01:06:57.457 --> 01:06:59.558
Mario.

835
01:07:11.869 --> 01:07:13.209
So this is the end.

836
01:07:13.209 --> 01:07:14.903
Being slowly digested
by an eel.

837
01:07:14.903 --> 01:07:17.114
next to an idiot in overalls.

838
01:07:17.114 --> 01:07:20.117
Well. at least your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

839
01:07:20.117 --> 01:07:21.382
At least you're not gonna die

840
01:07:21.382 --> 01:07:22.746
with your dad thinking
you're a joke.

841
01:07:22.746 --> 01:07:25.848
Yeah. well. my dad thinks
I'm a joke. too.

842
01:07:25.848 --> 01:07:27.850
Yeah? Well...

843
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.983
your dad's right!

844
01:07:28.983 --> 01:07:30.391
You know what?
I feel bad enough.

845
01:07:30.391 --> 01:07:31.854
Just-just leave me alone.

846
01:07:31.854 --> 01:07:34.428
I've never met your dad.
but he sounds brilliant.

847
01:07:34.428 --> 01:07:37.827
Just go in a corner and smash
some stuff. smash monkey!

848
01:07:38.993 --> 01:07:43.096
I am more than a guy

849
01:07:43.096 --> 01:07:45.142
who smashes things!

850
01:08:12.763 --> 01:08:16.239
- That was amazing!
- Now we're even!

851
01:08:45.202 --> 01:08:47.061
Princess. I got it.

852
01:08:47.061 --> 01:08:48.667
Great job.

853
01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:51.131
Couldn't have you going
out there without your bouquet.

854
01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:52.572
It's perfect.

855
01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:22.338
I'll be sacrificing them
in your honor.

856
01:09:23.308 --> 01:09:25.132
Lower the prisoners!

857
01:09:32.449 --> 01:09:34.449
Dearly belov...

858
01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:36.319
- Huh?

859
01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.519
- Drama.

860
01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:41.115
You really thought
I'd marry you?

861
01:09:41.115 --> 01:09:43.018
Kinda.

862
01:09:43.018 --> 01:09:45.658
I'd never marry a monster.

863
01:09:46.694 --> 01:09:49.695
Then we are breaking up
right now!

864
01:10:15.052 --> 01:10:16.656
They got to be up there.

865
01:10:19.254 --> 01:10:21.056
Fire!

866
01:10:28.703 --> 01:10:31.770
- You want to do this?
- Yes. I do.

867
01:10:41.045 --> 01:10:42.649
Yes! Fire!

868
01:10:57.259 --> 01:10:59.435
Woo-hoo!

869
01:10:59.435 --> 01:11:01.635
This is fun!

870
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:03.868
Ha! Loser!

871
01:11:07.808 --> 01:11:10.072
Hey. what does this do?

872
01:11:10.072 --> 01:11:12.206
Whoa!

873
01:11:12.206 --> 01:11:14.417
- Whoa. Yeah.

874
01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:17.651
Whoa.

875
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:20.489
Cool raccoon suit.

876
01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:22.788
- Really?
- Not at all.

877
01:11:55.152 --> 01:11:57.086
Whee!

878
01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:04.159
- Huh?

879
01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:11.067
Whew.

880
01:12:11.067 --> 01:12:12.475
Boo.

881
01:12:22.245 --> 01:12:24.487
Huh?

882
01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:27.347
- Lu!
- Mario?

883
01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:31.890
I told you. See?

884
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:35.927
As long as we're together.
everything is gonna be okay.

885
01:12:38.798 --> 01:12:41.262
Mario. why do you look
like a bear? What is this?

886
01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:46.839
You did good. kid.

887
01:12:46.839 --> 01:12:49.677
Make your pecs dance.
You deserve it.

888
01:12:49.677 --> 01:12:52.515
No time now. Definitely later.

889
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:06.496
Launch the Bomber Bill

890
01:13:06.496 --> 01:13:09.928
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

891
01:13:20.908 --> 01:13:22.875
No.

892
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.115
Hey. hey. Hey. over here.

893
01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:45.095
You asked for it.

894
01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:54.808
Hello.

895
01:14:14.597 --> 01:14:16.896
Ow!

896
01:14:18.636 --> 01:14:20.163
Really?

897
01:14:25.005 --> 01:14:27.038
Follow me.

898
01:14:31.374 --> 01:14:33.583
Come on.

899
01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:37.048
Little closer.

900
01:14:38.313 --> 01:14:42.218
Mamma mia!

901
01:14:52.637 --> 01:14:54.868
- Huh?

902
01:15:20.828 --> 01:15:22.632
- That's beautiful.
- You made these. right?

903
01:15:25.131 --> 01:15:27.703
- Huh? Whoa.

904
01:15:46.757 --> 01:15:48.790
Huh?

905
01:15:49.518 --> 01:15:50.825
Brooklyn?

906
01:15:52.387 --> 01:15:53.520
Mario?

907
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:57.293
- You almost dented my...

908
01:16:27.391 --> 01:16:30.062
Mario!

909
01:16:34.671 --> 01:16:36.398
You want this?

910
01:16:48.685 --> 01:16:50.445
You ruined my wedding!

911
01:16:50.445 --> 01:16:53.382
I was finally gonna be happy!

912
01:16:55.056 --> 01:16:58.761
- Now you will suffer!

913
01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:01.357
Like me!

914
01:17:15.439 --> 01:17:18.671
You really thought
you could stop me?

915
01:17:18.671 --> 01:17:21.883
You worthless.
weak little nothing.

916
01:17:21.883 --> 01:17:23.885
Come out and fight!

917
01:17:23.885 --> 01:17:26.250
Or are you too scared?

918
01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:32.058
Just what I thought.

919
01:17:50.747 --> 01:17:52.672
MARIO and LUIGI
Mamma mia!

920
01:17:52.672 --> 01:17:55.114
That's why the Sup-Super
Mario Brothers are here.

921
01:17:55.114 --> 01:17:57.611
A-to save Brooklyn...
save Brooklyn...

922
01:17:57.611 --> 01:18:00.218
Brooklyn... save Brooklyn.

923
01:18:17.974 --> 01:18:20.139
Let's-a go.

924
01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:26.574
Hey.

925
01:18:27.643 --> 01:18:29.181
Leave him alone.

926
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:31.447
Mario?

927
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.417
You just don't know
when to quit.

928
01:18:34.417 --> 01:18:35.649
Yeah.

929
01:18:35.649 --> 01:18:37.354
I've been told that before.

930
01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:41.688
Mario!

931
01:18:44.902 --> 01:18:46.968
The star!

932
01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:49.069
No! That's mine!

933
01:19:09.388 --> 01:19:10.486
Lu.

934
01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:15.458
Nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.

935
01:19:26.405 --> 01:19:27.536
No!

936
01:19:41.519 --> 01:19:42.518
Huh?

937
01:19:48.425 --> 01:19:51.164
- Rip them to pieces!

938
01:20:02.947 --> 01:20:04.375
Oh. hey. Spike.

939
01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:05.673
Luigi?

940
01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:22.162
- No!

941
01:20:22.758 --> 01:20:25.000
Mamma mia.

942
01:21:16.051 --> 01:21:17.646
Peaches.

943
01:21:17.646 --> 01:21:20.187
Uh. listen. this is not
the way I pictured it.

944
01:21:20.187 --> 01:21:22.354
but give me one more chance.

945
01:21:22.354 --> 01:21:24.422
Ew. no.

946
01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:26.886
No. no. no. no. n...

947
01:21:26.886 --> 01:21:28.756
Hey! Hey!

948
01:21:28.756 --> 01:21:30.296
That is not cool!

949
01:21:30.296 --> 01:21:32.331
Ha! He got the blue mushroom!

950
01:21:32.331 --> 01:21:34.795
Eh? I told you I'd get you
a pet turtle.

951
01:21:34.795 --> 01:21:38.007
Not bad. Mustache.

952
01:21:38.007 --> 01:21:41.043
And. Luigi. you're so brave.

953
01:21:41.043 --> 01:21:42.440
Oh. Thanks. uh...

954
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.112
Yeah. it's kind of my thing.

955
01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:46.840
Oh. my boys. my heroes!

956
01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.545
Woo-hoo!

957
01:21:48.545 --> 01:21:52.582
Mario. you were amazing.

958
01:21:52.582 --> 01:21:55.090
Thanks. Dad.

959
01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:57.125
- Ah. bring it in!

960
01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:06.860
