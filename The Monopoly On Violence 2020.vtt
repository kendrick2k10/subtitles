These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign.

4
00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:12.000
Here comes your guardian policeman.

5
00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.875
(Daniel Shaver) Please do not shoot me!

6
00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.500
(Officer Philip Brailsford)“THEN LISTEN TO MY INSTRUCTIONS! DON’T TALK. LISTEN!”

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
How can you be certain that all the people killed pose an imminent threat to the United States?

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.500
(Barack Obama) There's no doubt that civilians were killed.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
that shouldn’t have been”

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
(Narrator) In your life you will interact with many different social institutions.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500
There is one institution that is unlike any
other.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
One where you're subservient to others.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
From the cradle to the grave. you will be regulated. taxed. controlled. indoctrinated.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
coerced. judged. and possibly killed at the whims of members of this organization.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This institution is called the state.

16
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(James C Scott) Well. if we're talking about human history in the largest sense of the word.

17
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that is to say. Homosapiens has been around for 200.000 years.

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The state was invented only even at the most charitable estimate.

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
8.000 years ago. and

20
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
then it only touched a small portion of mankind.

21
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So the fact is that most of human history

22
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.500
has been a sort of statelessness.

23
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you ask yourself how long people have been ruled by states

24
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
a sort of massive level. I ask myself

25
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
“at what point in history do you imagine that more than half of mankind

26
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.000
would have experienced regular tax collections?” Like once a year or something like that.

27
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There might be plunder from time to time. right. but irregular. episodic.

28
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and the existence of a state in most people's life did not come into being for more than a half of mankind

29
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
until around 1600. If we take the history of mankind as a day.

30
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the state comes into being at about 11:30 at night. right.

31
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and it becomes Hegemonic at sort of 11:40 right 11:45 or 11:50.

32
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and the the thing that qualifies this. of course.

33
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
is that there's a whole lot fewer Homosapiens around in these early days.

34
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Even Western cities until maybe 1800. 1850.

35
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
never reproduced themselves by their internal population.

36
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that is to say they were so deadly because of typhoid and disease and epidemics and so on.

37
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that they killed more people than they…

38
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Their population could not grow internally. that all of these cities grew by

39
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
bringing in more people from the countryside because they had high rates of mortality.

40
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The reason the state forum has proven so durable and virtually universal.

41
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is that it takes a state to be a state.

42
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And so if you think of the early states. that is. the early states

43
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.500
were all founded in flood plains where you had concentrated agriculture

44
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.000
and could concentrate a large population. and that's why they tended to be

45
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
units that were more powerful militarily than a scattered and fragmented countryside around them.

46
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And in fact. they grew by plundering that population. by enclosing that population.

47
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.500
bringing it in. having them plant grain and capturing people.

48
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.500
So I try to show in “AGAINST THE GRAIN”. that most of the wars of these early states.

49
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
were wars of capture. in order to grab populations. This is true for the Athenians as well.

50
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Grab population. bring them in. have them produce for the center or work in the quarries.

51
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.500
(Narrator) Kingdoms expanded into empires. dominant kingdoms expanded by conquest.

52
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
suppressing people in new territories.A hierarchy of Governors managed the

53
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
increasing complexity of empires. A new system appeared in which power was given
to the people in the form of votes.

54
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Democracy diluted the absolute power of authorities. but introduced demagogues
and the tyranny of the majority.

55
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Civilization expanded. More decision-making power was delegated.

56
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Some political power became subordinated to laws. but delegating power especially military power risked a return to Empire.

57
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.500
Combining features of a democracy with a Republic. nations set up basic rights

58
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.000
subordinating more political power to the rule of law. Over time. however.

59
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
special interests found a way to use politics to their advantage.

60
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
JAMES C SCOTT:  Within a state. I think it's fair to say that you have got the standard aspects of what we all associate with the state.

61
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:11.000
which is tax collection. a system of centralized punishment. and centralized monopoly over violence.

62
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.500
so that executions that are legal executions can only be conducted by the state.

63
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.500
What's important to sort of recognize. is that until starting perhaps with the French Revolution.

64
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.500
In which which was an emancipatory movement. and the idea that

65
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
people in all of France were governed by the same law no matter who they were. everywhere in France.

66
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:52.000
That there were no serfs anymore. you were not under the personal lordship of an aristocrat or of the priestly control.

67
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The French Revolution marks that point in which the state comes to see as its…

68
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
One of its goals the collective welfare of the people.

69
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.500
Notice that the French Revolution did two things - it also made all Frenchmen equal in theory.

70
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.500
took a long time for that to come into practice. especially for women.

71
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.500
But it also made everyone directly ruled by the state.

72
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.500
NARRATOR: As populations increased States grew more sophisticated. controlling not just law.
taxation. and the military.

73
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.500
Eventually education. social services. central banking. and much of the economy.

74
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.500
Laws informed citizens what rules the state has decided they will obey. What began as a codification of norms became a way for special interests to control others.

75
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.500
The Protestant Reformation made people. the idea is that everyone can interpret the Bible on their own.

76
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.500
so they start thinking of moral decrees from God. and now legal decrees from the state

77
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.500
as what's written down on paper and issued by a sovereign.

78
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.500
This is the statist way of thinking and it's not what law used to be.

79
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.500
until the modern revolution of the modern concept of the state. which is only about two or three

80
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.500
hundred years old like the Westphalian concept of the state.

81
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.500
So Madison is probably the pivotal person in American history as the Scrivener of the Constitution.

82
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.500
as the chair of the House of Representatives committee that drafted the Bill of Rights.

83
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.500
He believed. we know this from what he said in his retirement. that he gave us a government

84
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.500
which was liberty of individuals granting power. It wasn't like
in Europe where power. Kings. reluctantly granted Liberty.

85
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.500
So in Madison's view the American system was the inversion of the European view.

86
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.500
Unlike all the strictures imposed on us by states. states themselves are chaotic -

87
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.500
states aren't required to follow any rules. There's no rule of law. that's a mythology that we cling to.

88
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.500
States can do what they want and they are the judge of their own actions. They’re the judge of their own criminality. they're the judge of their own civil penalties.

89
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.500
I mean. this is a bizarre state of affairs where maybe 1% of the population.

90
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.500
3 million or so federal employees get to dictate to the other 329 million of us how things are going to be.

91
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.500
and they're the sole arbiter of their own actions. This to me is chaotic.

92
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.500
NARRATOR: State education produces people who believe in and perpetuate the state's preferred way of thinking.

93
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.500
The the origins of the American education system start in the 19th century with reformers. so-called “moral reformers”.

94
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.500
people like Horace Mann and others who went to Prussia and found a system of education there that they wanted to emulate in the United States.

95
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.500
which they did. and they brought it back here and they established the modern public schooling system.

96
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:13.500
and the idea of a modern industrial capitalist curriculum. and they explicitly stated at the time. these reformers who established the schools in the 1830s and 1840s and 1850s.

97
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.500
they said at the time that what we need is to create citizens with these schools. which meant people who knew how to work under under industrial capitalism in a factory.

98
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.500
and soldiers - people who are willing to fight and die for the country.

99
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.500
So they needed to instill in people a regimentation - the idea that people can be made... can and should be made into machines.

100
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.500
functionaries for a new civilization. A new modern civilization where there were large factories and large armies.

101
00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:00.500
So the school system was designed purposely that way. and that's why we have the bell system. where the students move from class to class through the day. just like on an assembly line. and they are filled with one piece of information here and then filled with another piece of information there.

102
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:11.500
So they become both products of the assembly line and they become the managers of the assembly line. ideally. It's compulsory and universal. the education system.

103
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.500
So you’re obligated by law to send your child to a school that is approved of by the state. Now it can be your own school. but it has to be approved by the state.

104
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.500
Most of us don't have that luxury for various reasons. and especially poor people and working-class people. so they have to send their kids

105
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.500
most of them to government-run schools where they are obligated to stay by law from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. no matter what.

106
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.500
and if they leave they are truants. They become criminals and their parents are liable to arrest and prosecution and imprisonment.

107
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:54.500
and the job of the teachers. sure is to “educate” them with whatever the state deems to be a proper education. but it's also to keep them in those seats and in those rooms and in those buildings.

108
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.500
If the kid decides to get up and be a free human being and leave that building. the teacher is the first person tell him to stop. the first person to call security to force him to stay.

109
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.500
That's prison. It's a day prison. it's a minimum security prison. but it's a prison. If I don't send my son to that school. I go to prison or I can go to prison.

110
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.500
He. if he leaves the school. plays hooky he will probably get picked up by the police. detained. labeled a truant. and then brought back to the prison.

111
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.500
NARRATOR:  Services offered by government are not based on voluntary contract. The state expropriates its subjects wealth by compulsory taxation.

112
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.500
So why are they taxing us at all? That's a good question. I think it goes back to the idea of taxes as a tool of compliance and terror.

113
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.500
A budget is you planning ahead. and taxes is a method of procuring funds.

114
00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:01.500
So a budget means I sat down. I thought out my enterprise. it accounts for about this much. this is what I need over this period of time to account for my operations.

115
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:11.500
When you have a method of procuring your budget by just yanking more. you get to use ignorant excuses like “well we're not succeeding so we need more money.”

116
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.500
That's not a correlation. Maybe these people are incompetent. and they're squandering your money further. you know. It kind of it doesn't make sense when you start breaking all the things down.

117
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:35.500
The corporations don't pay taxes. business entities don't pay taxes. only people pay taxes. because a tax is a burden. It's something that we bear almost in a physical. visceral sense.

118
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:46.500
It's a way to ensure that Americans are docile and that Americans are frightened of their government. because that's the number one interaction most people have with the federal government.

119
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.500
is their annual tax form. The amount of tax revenue that government takes in doesn't cover everything it spends. and so to make up the difference. obviously they sell Treasury debt.

120
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.500
So you know as bizarre as it sounds. if a portion of the federal government's budget can be funded by debt. arguably the whole thing could be.

121
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.500
We could have no income taxes and the four trillion dollars that the US Fed gov spends every year could could be financed via Treasury debt. and then ultimately monetized by the Fed.

122
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.500
NARRATOR:  Central banks have significant control over the economies they govern. The Federal Reserve. the central bank of the United States.

123
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.500
determines interest rates. controls the money supply. picks winners and losers. and enables nearly limitless government spending.

124
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.500
Increasing money supply keeping interest rates low. it turns out that is very beneficial for the federal government.

125
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.500
The federal government whenever they spend more than they take in in tax revenues. they have to borrow. and just like anybody else has to borrow. we have to go to the credit markets.

126
00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:02.500
and we have to borrow at the prevailing interest rate. Well when the federal government. who has the ability to tax. they already get a lower interest rate than the rest of us.

127
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.500
They're able to borrow more. when already the servicing on the debt. the interest payments on the debt. are already one of our biggest expenses.

128
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:25.500
with the debt. what is it now 23 trillion dollars? With that kind of debt anybody else's credit would have run out a long time ago.

129
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.500
They are able to keep on doing this because the interest rates are low. So the fed’s role in allowing the government to overspend on all kinds of things.

130
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.500
but the biggest one would be military. on these wars. endless wars. They're able to keep doing that because they're just able to borrow at lower rates.

131
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.500
Absolute monarchs. when they got into wars. sometimes they'd run out of money. The Treasury would run dry.

132
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:06.500
so armies could not be paid. and they would stop battling in the field and go back. War is extremely expensive. Had Americans been forced to pay

133
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:16.500
by taxation for the Vietnam War. it would have stopped a lot sooner than it did. America could simply print money and buy the things that needed

134
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:29.500
to fight the war without having to raise taxes. So it's because it spares people from having to pay a visible price for the war that the war can go on.

135
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.500
NARRATOR:  State military conflicts destroy human lives. pollute the environment. impoverish millions of people. and waste scarce resources in pursuit of state political goals.

136
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.500
Regardless of whether they admit it or not. through all sources. about a trillion dollars goes to the so called defense budget.

137
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.500
Now that not only includes a six or seven hundred billion to DoD. but also State Department. a lot of US aid. A lot of other things in the federal budget are really

138
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.500
defense spending masquerading as something else. “Well government is too big and we need to cut spending.” If they're not talking about defense.

139
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.500
if they're not talking about entitlements. they're not being serious. There's no amount of cutting we can do in any other part of the government there would make a meaningful difference.

140
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:24.500
As Randolph Bourne famously put it. “war is the health of the state”. right. the state benefits in lots of ways. directly and indirectly from war.

141
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.500
I mean. everybody remembers Orwell's 1984 and the idea that war was so endemic that you didn't even know who the current enemy was.

142
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.500
and they kept switching it around right so people didn't care. They just knew that they were constantly in a state of warfare.

143
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.500
which of course. you know. allows the state to justify a lot of infringement on personal and community liberty that we would normally not tolerate. right.

144
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:59.500
“Oh well. we're in a time of war so we have to read your emails. and we have to spy on what you're doing and make sure that the enemy hasn’t infiltrated. you know. our midst.

145
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.500
The reason that most people go along with that. albeit. you know. with some some grumbling. is because they have been told we're at war.

146
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.500
“We're at war with terrorists who would want to blow up airplanes and want to hurt you etc. so you've got to sacrifice some of your liberty for the security that we the government offers.”

147
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.500
Well. this this is an example of the US government creating problems that it has the appearance then of solving.

148
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.500
We created a problem in Libya with our foreign policy of regime change of the Gaddafi regime. When we did unleash hell on the people of Libya.

149
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.500
the chaos broke out. as could be expected. as could be predicted. as we predicted. and that also then in turn requires more intervention

150
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.500
because you had jihadists moving into Chad and Niger and elsewhere. so you had to create more intervention to solve the problems that your intervention creates.

151
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:07.500
But the US uses jihadists. they use extremists as cat paws. They use it in Syria. They use the most violent Islamist extremists in Syria.

152
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.500
places like Syria to overthrow a completely secular regime. government. and so how many hundreds of thousands have died.

153
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.500
The global war on terror is ramped up and ramped down as Washington needs new enemies or doesn't need new enemies.

154
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.500
In the most it's fabricated. in the very least it’s something that's created by our foreign policy.

155
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.500
It's the same thing from the Reagan. years the Clinton. years and really some during the HW Bush. but especially during the Bill Clinton years.

156
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:55.500
and then again during Bush and Obama. America uses these jihadi. saudi-backed. Sunni suicide bomber terrorists for American imperial ends.

157
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.500
Our government hates their adversaries more than they hate our blood enemies who have slaughtered Americans by the thousands.

158
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:15.500
and American soldiers by the thousands in Iraq war two as well. This is how crazy their priorities are compared to what the American people

159
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.500
believed they were giving them the writ to do - to protect us from these terrorist groups. And of course Obama’s support for al Qaeda in Syria

160
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:35.500
led to the rise of the Islamic State. In 2013 they conquered all of eastern Syria. in 2014 they rolled into all of western Iraq.

161
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.500
All of Iraqi Sunni Stan and the Islamofascist Caliphate that had been bin Laden's wildest dream from the Attic he was hiding in.

162
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:56.500
and had been George Bush's most phony propaganda from the era of his terror war in Iraq had become true.

163
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.500
Bush opened up Western Iraq and then Obama backed them to the hilt in Syria. to such a degree they were able to erase

164
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:16.500
the sykes-picot border between Syria and Iraq and declare a brand new Islamist caliphate. And they had seized a territory the size of Great Britain

165
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.500
which they held for three years before America had then. guess what. of course had to ally with the Shia in Iraq.

166
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.500
The bata Brigade. the Iraqi Shiite army. and all of those iranian-backed militias. America flew as their Air Force.

167
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.500
The same guys our government wish they hadn't fought for in Iraq war two. they ended up fighting for him again in Iraq war three.

168
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:51.500
And even now our special operations forces are embedded with these. well certainly the Iraqi army. but essentially one degree away from these very same Shiite militias.

169
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.500
The ones that Donald Rumsfeld had used back in 2005 when he called it the el salvador option. His desk was to hunt down the Sunnis.

170
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.500
We’re playing that same game right now. And so America is on both sides of this terror war all over the region. Same kind of thing is going on in Yemen.

171
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:19.500
The war in Yemen is against Iranian backed group called the Houthis. who have taken over the capitol city and it has put the USA.

172
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:29.500
with our Saudi and UAE analyzed. again directly on the side of al Qaeda. flying as their air force. against their primary enemies the Houthis.

173
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:39.500
and even the AP and CNN have reported about Al Qaeda embedded with UAE forces driving American MRAP IED resistant vehicles

174
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:52.500
and participating in the slaughter of civilians in that war. Again with America flying as al-qaeda's air force against an enemy that has a friendly relationship with Iran.

175
00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:02.500
Not that Iran attacked us. At this point it seems like through the Clinton Bush Obama and now into the Trump governments.

176
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.500
to see that this bait-and-switch continues on should mean to the American people. to any of us libertarians or anyone else.

177
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.500
that this government is not fit to be our security force. Our security is not its priority.

178
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.500
NARRATOR:  Democide is when a government kills its own people. In the twentieth century. it's been estimated to two hundred and fifty six million people

179
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.500
killed by their own government. That's six times greater than the amount who died in wars.

180
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.500
Government and the military. the US military and other militaries around the world. but primarily we want to look at

181
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.500
communist countries and or socialist countries who killed vast numbers of their own populations. I think that's the greatest indictment

182
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.500
against socialism and communism. is that the Soviet Union killed millions of its own people. starve them to death with famine.

183
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:15.500
They did the same thing in Red China where tens and tens of millions of their own citizens were killed off. and so government.

184
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.500
particularly when you see where the level of government is highest. and that's in socialism and communism in particular.

185
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.500
Cambodia is another example where a high percentage of the Khmer Rouge regime killed off millions of Cambodians.

186
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.500
so the biggest problem in the world in terms of modern history has been communist dictators killing off their own citizens.

187
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.500
NARRATOR:  Numerous arguments have been used in attempts to justify the state's authority. For a time it was the Divine Right of Kings.

188
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.500
More modern justifications argue the state's authority comes from the consent of its people. often referred to as the social contract.

189
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.500
There are basically three three versions of social contract. There's like the explicit contract theory the complicit contract theory

190
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.500
and the hypothetical contract theory. The explicit contract theory might sound like a strawman but it's not. So it's a theory that

191
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.500
some people actually literally got together and said to each other “Hey. let's establish a government” like they literally explicitly agreed with each other.

192
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.500
either writing it down or saying it in words. That might sound like a strawman. nobody thinks that that really happened.

193
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.500
but actually John Locke thought that that happened. He thought that with all of the cities there was a time. like when a city was first founded.

194
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.500
there was a time when the founders got together and explicitly agreed that they were going to set up a government for their city.

195
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.500
Okay. um. and then. so it was explicit for first generation then according to Locke it's only implicit for the later generations okay.

196
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.500
because he's not totally stupid. The explicit contract theory. um you know that's basically not true. So though like the governments that control

197
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:10.500
the land existing today. almost all of them got it by conquest or usurpation. This is discussed in David Hume’s famous essay of the original contract.

198
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:22.500
So conquest meaning like a bunch of people sailed from Europe over to this place we're in now and they just kick the shit out of the people who are living there

199
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.500
and take the land. and that's how we have control of the land. Okay. Usurpation is where. you know. there's a government

200
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.500
and then somebody just like takes over the government by force. like there's a military coup they set up a new government.

201
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.500
The hypothetical contract theory is a theory that “well. people *would* agree to set up a government.” this didn't actually happen

202
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:52.500
because like you weren't actually given a choice. and there was already government when born. but if somebody asked you. and if you were rational.

203
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.500
you would have agreed to have a government. right. and then so that makes it okay to impose a government on you.

204
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:08.500
Okay now there are some cases where a hypothetical agreement is valid. Mainly it's valid if it's impossible to actually ask the person.

205
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.500
and you have good reason to believe that they would in fact consent based upon their actual beliefs and values.

206
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.500
So there's an accident victim who's been brought in to the hospital and they're unconscious. and you need consent to operate on them
205
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.500
but the person’s unconscious. the doctors go ahead anyway. and the argument is “Well look. almost certainly this person would consent to be operated on.

207
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:41.500
because almost everyone values their life. and etcetera. But it doesn't work if first of all. you can ask the person and you just don't want to

208
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.500
because you're afraid they're gonna say no. Okay so then you cannot appeal hypothetical consent. Secondly. it doesn't work if you say

209
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.500
“well they would consent if they had different philosophical beliefs from their actual beliefs.” So no. you can't do that. right.

210
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.500
So. and that will be required for the hypothetical consent to the government. because there are actual people. they're called anarchists.

211
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:14.500
who we know would not consent. Okay. but that's not really legitimate. So like if you have a patient who you know they wouldn't consent to be operated on.

212
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.500
because like they've said that many times when they were conscious. you can't say “oh they would consent.”

213
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.500
Also. if you have the patient and they're perfectly conscious and you just don't want to ask them. like that's not legitimate.

214
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.500
You can't say “I don't want to ask the patient because I'm afraid he might say no. so I'm just gonna argue that you probably would say yes”

215
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.500
“we're just gonna like yes. I'm gonna do the operation.” You can't do that. right. Okay. that's like the situation with the government.

216
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.500
Why is the government not. like. they could ask us. They could. like. the IRS when they send out your tax turn they could have a question on it that says

217
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.500
“do you agree to the federal government of the United States?” And then if you say no then you get a full refund of your taxes.

218
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.500
I wonder why they're not doing that... and it's not because they already know everyone would agree. It's because they know too many people would not agree.

219
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.500
and then they would have to give back the money. and they don't want to give it back.

220
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.500
So when a young person reaches an age of consciousness where they might be able to reasonably think about and read about

221
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.500
the nature of government for themselves. their friendly local city councilman. or congressman. or governor. or whomever.

222
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.500
doesn't come over and say “well hello young citizen X. Pleased to meet you. I'd like to offer you my governmental services

223
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:39.500
which will include road and police and fire and courts and colleges. all kinds of wonderful things. and in exchange. here's some contract terms.

224
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.500
If you sign this. you know. you agree at let's say at the state level to pay an 8% annual income tax. and there'll be some sales and property taxes

225
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.500
along with it. but you know. it's all gonna work out swimmingly for you. and you're really gonna like this.”

226
00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.500
And so this this young person takes a look at it and says “well. you know. that's interesting. you know. I appreciate this.

227
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.500
and you haven't stuck a gun in my face. at least yet. but I'd like to shop around a bit.” Well. well hold on a minute.

228
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.500
It turns out there is no shopping around. It turns out that this contract being offered to you is kind of one-sided.

229
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.500
We have a monopoly provider for these services and it turns out that the price you're going to pay for these services

230
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.500
can be changed almost at will by the service provider himself. and his cronies in the legislature. So all this would be

231
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.500
a very odd form of contract for most people. And then if it turns out that you know. even when you couldn't shop around.

232
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.500
you couldn't even say no. In other words if this young person said “I'm gonna go live out in the woods by myself

233
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.500
and I'm not going to use your roads and I'm not going to use your schools. I'm not going to use your fire and police and I'm not going to pay.”

234
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.500
That sounds fair. right? I'm not using your services. what you're trying to impose upon me. Well it turns out that even then. no.

235
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.500
You still have to pay your 8% tribute as a citizen of state X. So this is a very odd form of contract if we look at it that way.

236
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.500
NARRATOR:  Some argue that democracy is what makes a state authority justified.

237
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.500
People who appeal to democracy. usually they appear to have a simplistic view. like all the laws that are passed are authorized by people.

238
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.500
so that to begin with is really questionable. It's very possible to have laws that are not not accepted by the majority of people.

239
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:39.500
So obvious cases would be like in two thousand eight to nine. the bailout of the big banks was very unpopular among people - among both Democrats and Republicans.

240
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.500
but just the voters. not the politicians. It was popular among the politicians. and they passed it anyway.

241
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.500
And that's just an illustration of the fact that. you know. however you want to account for why this happens. laws do get passed that most people don't support.

242
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:05.500
Okay. Second thing to say is “who cares if most people support it?” Right? So. you know. the question is if a larger number of people want to do something

243
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:15.500
that would otherwise be morally wrong. does it become morally permissible because there's a larger number of people who support it than are against it. so generally not.

244
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.500
Right? Like. there's no other case in which you would say that. So you know. there's five people in the room. four of them want to beat up the fifth person.

245
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.500
they decide to take a vote on whether beating up the fifth person is okay. Only one person opposes it. “No. I'm against beating me up.”

246
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.500
And then “oh”. so now the four people can beat up the five. because there are there were more of them. it's a majority rule.

247
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.500
Okay so nobody thinks that that makes it okay to beat up the person. Nobody thinks that that suspends the person’s rights. You can just go through any.

248
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.500
like any other circumstance that doesn't involve the government. you wouldn't say an action that was initially wrong. becomes okay if a majority of people support it.

249
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:05.500
So as the great Tom woods always says. it's my favorite analogy ever. he said “well. imagine Walmart ran all the schools and you had to send your kids to an institution run by Walmart.

250
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:14.500
and every morning they had to pledge allegiance to Walmart. and you had pictures of all the Walmart CEOs all around the room.

251
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.500
and they would tell you all these fantastic. you know. tales… well the first WalMart CEO never told a lie... and you know like all this.

252
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.500
just the outright lies and propaganda. and then you had a society that was. um. you know. really favored Walmart.

253
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.500
You're like “why do you think they liked Walmart so much?” Cause. well. it's because they're being propagandized from the time they were children. and you know. propaganda works.

254
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.500
What the states keep out of history textbooks are the things that call into question the existence of the states themselves.

255
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:57.500
that call into question the existence of our form of governance. that call into question the existence of a nation state to begin with. they call into existence.

256
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:11.500
call into question the existence of borders. governments. police. prisons. anything that calls into question the existence of the system those schools belong to.

257
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:22.500
NARRATOR:  State overreach is a perpetual threat to individual liberty. The state insists on scrutinizing lives of its subjects but resists reform. transparency. and accountability.

258
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:33.500
The individual actors in government are not bearing the costs. the net costs of their actions. So if you want individual rationality to lead to group rationality.

259
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:44.500
you need some mechanism such that when I take an action. I bear most of the net costs. I get the benefits. and pay the costs.

260
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.500
And on the market. that's mostly true. they're not perfectly true. ordinary private market. But in the political market it's almost never true.

261
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:02.500
that if I vote for the bad candidate and he gets elected. the costs of that are distributed around at least my country. and maybe the world.

262
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.500
If I'm a judge and I make a decision that sets A bad precedent. I'll never know that it was a bad precedent.

263
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.500
I’m imagining a precedent which changes the legal system just a little bit. and a very small change in the legal system might produce costs of say.

264
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.500
100 million dollars a year. Huge amount of damage for one person to. to make.

265
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.500
Commerce Clause. for example. which gives Congress only the power to regulate interstate commerce. and which to Madison. regulate meant to keep regular.

266
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:43.500
Marshall and his colleagues and subsequent courts have interpreted it to allow Congress to do nearly anything it wants. The color of your shirt. the thickness of

267
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:54.500
the soles in your shoes. the pigment on the paint. the brightness of the lights. the curvature of the lens. all these things are absurdly regulated by the feds.

268
00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.500
So. I think there's really two reasons why businesses feel the need to lobby and interact with the state. So one. they want to get privileges.

269
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
over their competitors. and they want to try and get some sort of subsidies. tariffs. restrictions. monopolistic grants of privileges

270
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.500
over their competitors. and they want to try and get some sort of subsidies. tariffs. restrictions. monopolistic grants of privileges
that can give them an edge over their competitors. so they act as political entrepreneurs.

271
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:16.500
that can give them an edge over their competitors. so they act as political entrepreneurs.

272
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.500
The other tendency is that their competitors are also doing the exact same thing as well as other interest groups. so various ideologues.

273
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.500
reformers. socialists. unions etc. and they feel the need to basically block hostile regulation that's coming in threatening.

274
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:43.500
So then other words have to play both the offense and the defense. So they're in the political arena to secure benefits and shape regulation to their advantage.

275
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:55.500
I remember one time that a cop said to a friend of mine... he caught a friend of mine. we were 14. and he said he smelled weed.

276
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.500
And we actually weren't smoking weed. And. you know he could have easily caught us like an hour later and we probably would have been.

277
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.500
but we weren't smoking weed. And my friend was really scared. and he got in his face and put a flashlight right in his face and he said “are you scared?

278
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.500
I want to watch you piss your pants in front of me” to a 14 year old child.

279
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.500
If a police officer stops you. you don't have. even if you know that you're innocent. you don't have the freedom to tell them

280
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.500
“no. I don't want to deal with you.” No. they have a monopoly on force - they can initiate force. initiate violence.

281
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.500
up to and including killing you if you do not abide by what they have to say.

282
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:45.500
A pretty close state to absolute power in the dynamic of a cop. particularly a cop with a teenager. but in general a cop. I mean what. you know.

283
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.500
like even then. you’ll be lIke “well I didn't consent to that search.” Well. what happens if a cop says in court you did? It's your word against the cop’s.

284
00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:00.500
Who are they gonna side with? They side with the cop every time. So there's two dynamics. there's one that power corrupts. and so you give people this power. none of us do well.

285
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.500
NARRATOR:  International law is a legal system that is created without an overarching sovereign. In a sense. it mimics anarchist law.

286
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.500
It's a bunch of different states and they interact with each other in an environment where there isn't a higher power that hands down

287
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.500
what the rules are of the game. and how everyone shall behave.

288
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.500
The international system is self governed in the sense that all the states work together at least ostensibly as equals.

289
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.500
So international law. I believe can serve as a model for how we could imagine the possibility of a stateless order.

290
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.500
because we do have 200 “citizens” of the world. which don't have an overarching super sovereign. So it's possible to have peace among actors

291
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.500
that are decentralized and that are sovereign with respect to themselves. and don't have an overlord that forces them

292
00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:04.500
to comply with some kind of set of rules. So the Hobbesian idea that you can’t have order among the individuals without a government

293
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.500
to tell them what to do. is sort of disproved by the existence of the international order and the international law.

294
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.500
Question is how would we apply that then. down to a lower and lower level. and the key issue would be just to keep adding more and more

295
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.500
choice among people actually living in these places in terms of different legal systems that they can choose from. different societies.

296
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:35.500
Anarchism can be difficult to define. In spite of often being incorrectly used to mean chaos. the word actually comes from the Greek word “anarchia”

297
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.500
meaning “without a ruler”. The earliest traces of anarchist thought date back to ancient Greece and China. where many philosophers

298
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:52.500
questioned the legitimacy of the state. Taoist sages like Lao Tzu and Shangzhou developed a non-rule type of philosophy

299
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.500
that would eschew any type of political involvement. Ancient Greece also gave rise to some early anarchist thought. In 300 BC.

300
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.500
Zeno of Citium founded stoicism. Heavily influenced by the cynics. his Republic advocates for removing all state structures.

301
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.500
Gerrard Winstanley. who was part of the Diggers movement during the English Civil War. would become the foremost prominent proponent of Christian anarchism.

302
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.500
He published a pamphlet in which he drew upon the Bible claiming that the blessings on earth should be common to all. and that none lord over others.

303
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:36.500
He argued for communal ownership. In 1703. Louis Armand. Baron de Lahontan used the word “anarchy” in his new voyages in North America

304
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:46.500
to describe the peaceful indigenous people as having no state and no prisons. Jean-Jacques Rousseau. especially in his discourse on inequality.

305
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:55.500
had a strong impact on anarchism - he argued that due to man's good nature. state was oppressive. In 1793. William Godwin

306
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.500
would write one of the first anarchist texts inquiring and concerning political justice. Around the end of the 18th century. Godwin was the first

307
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.500
to use anarchism as the name of a philosophy which would ultimately be popularized by the end of the 19th century. Max Stirner who wrote

308
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:24.500
“The Ego and its Own”. Stirner advocated for a more radical type of individualism. Stirner argued “we are all egoists doing everything for our own advantage.”

309
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.500
Stirner did not believe there were rights that transcended morality. labeling such things as “spooks”. created by the powerful to oppress.

310
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:44.500
Left anarchism has a rich spectrum of ideas bridging ecology. labor relations. social and sexual inequality. Authors like Murray Bookchin and Noam Chomsky

311
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:54.500
were strongly associated with left anarchism. particularly anarcho-syndicalism. Emma Goldman was a prominent anarchist activist. once known

312
00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:05.500
as the most dangerous woman in America. She was born in what is now Lithuania. and moved to the U.S. in 1885. She heavily influenced and lectured

313
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:15.500
on anarchist philosophy. women's rights. and social issues of the day. She founded the anarchist journal “Mother Earth” in 1906.

314
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:29.500
Voltairine de Cleyre was an American anarchist and contemporary of Emma Goldman. who ultimately advocated for anarchism without adjectives.

315
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
foregoing descriptions such as individualist. communist. mutualist. or collectivist. she was staunchly against the state and the existence of standing army.

316
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:40.500
foregoing descriptions such as individualist. communist. mutualist. or collectivist. she was staunchly against the state and the existence of standing army.
Her contributions to anarchism and her lecture named “sex slavery” helped create the foundations of anarcho feminism. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

317
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:47.500
Her contributions to anarchism and her lecture named “sex slavery” helped create the foundations of anarcho feminism. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

318
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.500
published his “What is Property?” in 1840. which would prove to become a highly influential book on anarchist thought.

319
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.500
Proudhon argued property. as most people understand it. is theft. That being said. he also argued the property that was a result of labor was legitimate

320
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:13.500
but property of unused land. or that profits from rent or interest was illegitimate. Proudhon argued “to be governed is to be watched. inspected. spied on.

321
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.500
directed. law driven. numbered. regulated. enrolled. indoctrinated. preached at. controlled. checked. estimated. valued. censured. commanded.

322
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.500
by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. His philosophy. which has influenced anarchist thought across the spectrum.

323
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.500
was called mutualism. There was also Mikhail Bakunin. Bakunin argued that freedom and equality were inseparable. Bakunin said in

324
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.500
“The Political Philosophy of Bakunin”. scientific anarchism. “we are convinced that freedom without socialism is privilege and injustice.

325
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.500
and that socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.” Bakunin’s philosophy is called collectivist anarchism. At the end of the 19th century

326
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.500
came Peter Kropotkin. Kropotkin wanted to synthesize communism and anarchism. creating anarcho-communism. Kropotkin argued

327
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.500
with those who sought to use Darwin's new theory of evolution to justify racial and class inequality. Kropotkin argued that mutual aid.

328
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.500
rather than the dominant gene and a species. that the defining feature of evolution was actually mutual aid. Kropotkin also wrote

329
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.500
“The Conquest of Bread.” This book was hugely influential on anarchists in Catalonia as well as in the modern-day Rojava.

330
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.500
This created a divide in the 19th century between anarchists who were communists and those who were not. Mutualists believed in individual property rights

331
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:45.500
but with equal access to lands sans taxation - sans taxation and sans profit. Anarcho-communists on the other hand. believed the community

332
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.500
rather than the individual should be in control of property. removing all market transactions. and would adopt the Marxist principle of

333
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.500
“from each according to his ability to each according to his need.” There were also anarchists in America who were influenced by both

334
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.500
Proudhon’s mutualism as well as by classical liberalism. Josiah Ward who put his theories to the test with a “labor for labor store”. Cincinnati Time Store.

335
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.500
in which trade notes were issued. backed by the promise of labor. This was the first store to function this way and actually proved quite successful

336
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.500
before Ward decided to close shop in order to pursue colonies based on his understanding of mutualism. Warren Settlement. modern times.

337
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.500
whose name would later be changed to “Brentwood”. had no government. no clearly defined laws. and no money. yet absolutely no crime. and very little commotion.

338
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:40.500
Another American anarchist. Benjamin Tucker. said of Warren. that he was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism.

339
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:49.500
Speaking of Benjamin Tucker. he was another anarchist who described himself as an unterrified Jeffersonian. Tucker's focus was on his fear of central planning.

340
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.500
fearing that it may have destroyed any hope for either anarchy or central planning. A more controversial claim of Tucker's

341
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.500
echoed only by anarchists hostile to communism. was “anarchism is a word without meaning unless it includes the liberty of the individual

342
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.500
to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through the exchange in a free market. that is. private property.

343
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.500
Whoever denies private property is of necessity an ‘archist’.” Gustave de Molinari wrote “The Production Of Security” in 1849.

344
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.500
Murray Rothbard would consider him to be the great innovator in the market provision of security. Then. we have Lysander Spooner.

345
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.500
who is influential to both left-leaning anarchists as well as anarcho-capitalists. Lysander Spooner was an abolitionist and a constitutional lawyer.

346
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:42.500
In 1845. he wrote the “Unconstitutionality of Slavery”. Spooner used both legal and natural law arguments to prove the Constitution

347
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.500
in fact did not support slavery. He acknowledged the founding fathers of America probably did not intend to end slavery

348
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.500
but only the meaning of the text and not the individual intentions of its authors were enforceable. He later wrote pamphlets

349
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:03.500
on jury nullification as well as legal advice for escaped slaves. and gave legal services to fugitives. The debate between communist anarchists

350
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.500
and non communists would become so hotly contested that some it makes the case it may be why some anarchists. anarcho capitalists.

351
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.500
reject socialism altogether. often to incorporate classic liberal ideals such as homesteading. moving away from socialism.

352
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.500
and towards an anarchist form of classical liberalism. Anarcho-capitalism is a school of anarchism that advocates

353
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.500
individual autonomy and private property.

354
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:37.500
What happened was over the last several centuries starting with the 17th to the 19th century. we had a march. an upward march.

355
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.500
not upward every day but basically upward march of freedom. and the death of the old order. which was statism. and serfdom. slavery.

356
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:55.500
and the theocracy. and rising up from this muck. the idea of individual freedom and the institution of individual freedom.

357
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.500
personal freedom. religious. freedom. political freedom. economic freedom. free-market.

358
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:14.500
He had a really comprehensive knowledge. not just of economics. but political theory. philosophy. and many other subjects.

359
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:23.500
and he had a tremendous intellectual curiosity about all things. He was constantly coming up with new ideas.

360
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.500
He was very enthusiastic about the new ideas he founded.

361
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:38.500
First is the non-aggression principle. NAP. Keep your mitts to yourself and don't grab other people with their property. without their permission.

362
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:49.500
Now in boxing. if you and I are in a boxing match and you punch me in the nose. I can't say “assault and battery” because I've agreed to be hit above the belt.

363
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.500
The second one would be private property rights. and we need private property rights. because.
suppose

364
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.500
you grab this shirt that I'm now wearing. Did you violate the non-aggression principle? Well it all depends on who owns this shirt.

365
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:11.500
If I stole it from you yesterday. you're just repossessing your property. and I'm the bad guy. On the other hand. it's my shirt keep your mitts off.

366
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.500
and if you grab it you're the bad guy. So we have to know. who is the owner of my shirt? And the third one is free association.

367
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.500
No one should be forced or compelled to associate with anyone against his will. One of the direct effects of the non-aggression principle.

368
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:36.500
the “nap” NAP. is no government. That would be the purest libertarian view. Why? Because government taxes people against their will.

369
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.500
and we just got finished saying that the non-aggression principle says that you shouldn't be forced to do anything.

370
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.500
You should be able to do anything you damn well please. except keep your mitts off of other people. Well when they're taxing us.

371
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.500
that violates the non-aggression principle and it violates free association. They're making us associate with them.

372
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.500
and where do we get that from? I didn't sign the Constitution.

373
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.500
The idea that rights are simple and clear. and therefore you can eliminate everything by.

374
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.500
you can solve all problems by showing “you can't do that because it violates rights.” And some of those. I guess my favorite

375
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.500
counter to that. which comes from Bill Bradford. who was the editor of Liberty magazine. he's no longer alive unfortunately.

376
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:34.500
But he was an interesting guy and he says. alright. this is my memory of his example. “you fall off your balcony on the

377
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:42.500
15th floor of an apartment building. unfortunately. But fortunately. there's a flagpole coming off the balcony on the 14th

378
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.500
floor just below you. and you managed to grab hold of that. doesn't break. and you're going hand over hand back

379
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.500
to the 14th floor balcony to get on it. and get down. when the owner of that apartment comes out of his. comes onto his balcony. He says

380
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:07.500
“that flagpole is my property. not yours. Let go.” Do you?  Well if the answer is that you don't. we have to either say that's because you're a bad person.

381
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.500
you've just violated his rights. or you have to say it is morally legitimate to violate rights when enough is at stake.

382
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.500
which is basically what this comes to.

383
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.500
Once you've conceded that it's morally right to violate rights when enough is at stake. now you've abandoned the moral argument against almost everything.

384
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:38.500
I know lots of people have different visions of what this looks like. but let's say we're talking about an extremely decentralized covenant community.

385
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:48.500
where people just come together and form communities where they sign a contract. and “I agree to live in this place and follow these rules.”

386
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.500
and as I argue in some of my essays. is probably the likely way that most people would live.

387
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:03.500
A lot of people imagine that “oh well. I'll just go out and do my own thing out in the countryside and no one will bother me.”

388
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.500
This. of course. is an extremely naive way of looking at things. your neighbors would probably just come and try and take your stuff away.

389
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.500
So most people would congregate into a group of some kind and then agree to give up

390
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.500
certain amounts. certain prerogatives. in order to amass their resources and put together private security force and so on.

391
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:32.500
I think when it comes to the most widely understood cases of unjustified aggression. there is a pretty broad

392
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.500
range of agreement. I mean. yeah not everybody thinks taxation is theft. but virtually everybody thinks murder can't be justified.

393
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.500
Virtually everybody thinks you can't break into somebody's house and take his things.

394
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.500
and that's the baseline we operate from. and if there are a handful of people who don't accept that

395
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.500
well that's what we have self-defense for.

396
00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:03.500
I think it's just a numbers game. like it's just how many people believe in the moral legitimacy of the ruling class.

397
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.500
because people say “well. how do we end this and how do we end that?”

398
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.500
And you know there are people using cryptos to undermine the extortion racket. which is awesome.

399
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.500
There are people who are big on second Amendment rights. and like. we need guns so. we have the ability to forcibly defend.

400
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.500
if they do this. which I'm fine with that too. But to me it's a numbers game like if there's only a few of us you know we're doomed.

401
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.500
You can run off and hide the cabin in the woods or something and you might get away with that.

402
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.500
but I want to see the whole world become free and rational and moral.

403
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.500
NARRATOR:  Agorism is the school of anarchist thought developed by Samuel Edward Conkin the third.

404
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.500
Conkin advocated for peaceful counter economics with the intent to starve the state of funding.

405
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.500
Sam and Neil were driving cross country actually. they were at college in New York and they were driving across country.

406
00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:01.500
and they worked out the details of agorism and Neil put it into his book “Alongside Night”.

407
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.500
If I recall correctly Sam was supposed to have a book come out. but he couldn't find the publisher.

408
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.500
so Neil. who you know. he's friends with Heinlein and a lot of different authors. he's a little more established

409
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.500
in the writing scene he put out “Alongside Night”.and that was really the foundational text of agorism.

410
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:30.500
The main thing is just pretty much bleeding the state dry. staying out of the state in any way possible. like not paying taxes.

411
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:37.500
cash transactions and all that. but with the idea of doing it to stay away from government.

412
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:45.500
The white market. which is obviously the acceptable market. you know. everybody trades in that. You know. taxes. regulations.

413
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:56.500
Then there's the gray markets which is. you know. it's a legal business. but you're maybe. you're not paying taxes you know.

414
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:04.500
you’re a tax evader or whatever. and you know. you're not claiming everything. or it's not regulated.

415
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:13.500
Karl Hess was one of the early agorists. he used to be Republican. He worked for Barry Goldwater

416
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.500
and he coined the term or the phrase “extremism in defense of Liberty is no vice”.

417
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.500
and eventually he became more and more of an anarchist and he got in with Sam Conkin and all those guys.

418
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:33.500
and he wrote “Community Technology”. which is a little. I hesitate to call it a book because it's so small. it's really just a booklet

419
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.500
where he describes his whole experience in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington DC.

420
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:47.500
where he creates this whole farm in an urban environment. and what's really striking to me is that if you can do that

421
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.500
in Washington DC you can do that anywhere.

422
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:59.500
Nobody is capable by revolutionary action of overturning great social systems. It has never been done.

423
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.500
There hasn't been a revolution by armed force ever in the history of the world.

424
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.500
What we have had is changes of management very often. but no revolution.

425
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:21.500
Crypto anarchy. So the idea is essentially that the use of cryptography will help us subvert or undermine the state.

426
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:29.500
and I think that's absolutely huge to where we are in the future. not just in terms of blockchains. but also like set in terms of Tor as well.

427
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:39.500
So when we combine the two. again we have things like the Silk Road where you can buy and sell at will. whatever you want.

428
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.500
to whomever you want without any form of regulation or censorship by Congress. or your governor. your state legislature.

429
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.500
Crypto Anarchy. is. that is to me what's going to save us.

430
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.500
and I think the crypto anarchists have become essentially a wing of the agorist movement.

431
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:08.500
Anarchy is just normal life that happens all around us every day. When we walk down the street we all have a vested interest

432
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.500
and just having society where we deal with one another peaceably. and we deal with one another in ways that we feel

433
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.500
are justified and win-win. I mean anarchy is just it's just in the air around us. it's not something abstract.

434
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.500
it's just human beings doing what they want to do voluntarily. well. without force without coercion.

435
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:37.500
We can distinguish between individualist anarchism. which is based on private property ownership.

436
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.500
and other types of anarchism that are more communitarian. kind of. don't recognize private property.

437
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:59.500
I think that by anarchist societies. and by anarchism in general. compared to its popular use as

438
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:08.500
“chaos. disorder. violence:. and so on. the anarchism ought to be understood

439
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.500
as forms of cooperation and mutuality without hierarchy.

440
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.500
I think that developers would develop towns and cities. and people that lived in towns already and so on.

441
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:31.500
those would be the public areas. let's say. would then be owned. almost as stockholders.

442
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.500
People in the town would be stockholders in those public areas.

443
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.500
But I think you could have any number of organizations where people come together and form a variety of communal organizations.

444
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.500
own communal property. have communally owned towns and cities and so on. Those could all certainly meet the definition.

445
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.500
that I think. the key component there is that you would have a lot of choice about where you would live.

446
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.500
NARRATOR:  In 1860. Paul Émile de Puydt coined the term Panarchy. which is a system that recognizes the

447
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.500
individuals right to choose any form of government without being forced to move from their current locale.

448
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.500
Panarchy. to me. is one of the next stages of human social evolution. Instead of pure anarchy. okay.

449
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.500
which sometimes you might think of anarchy. or some people might think of anarchy. as just being utopian. being fanciful.

450
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:35.500
Panarchy is a way of describing arrangements where we don't make any sort of judgments about the kinds

451
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:44.500
of civil association that people want to enter into. but they do that rather freely. And what's interesting about panarchy

452
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.500
is it's different from polycentrism which is another fancy p word that just means we're breaking up power into smaller

453
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:57.500
jurisdictions and allowing for people to vote with their feet. If they don't like this jurisdiction. they can go to the other one.

454
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.500
Polycentrism is this idea and it's really important. You can join your Republican or Democrat or socialist

455
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.500
or what-have-you association.and in your home. So instead of joining a party that fights over who gets to

456
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.500
control 350 million people. say a panarchic state of affairs would just be if you believe in joining a kibbutz

457
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.500
or you believe in the Singaporean healthcare system or if you believe in some other set of governance.

458
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.500
arrangements. be they hierarchical or decentralized. you can join those. and you can exit them if they're not working out for you.

459
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.500
You get a market in governance that is divorced from territory. We have to ask ourselves now. in this day and age.

460
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.500
why is it that rules have to be attached to territory? Always and in every case they don't need to be.

461
01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.500
and in fact. for most things. the rules we live under are an artifact of conquest. are an artifact of. you know.

462
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.500
“I was born on on this patch of soil that long time ago was conquered by somebody who makes the rules on my behalf.”

463
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.500
It doesn't have to be this way. but a panarchist says “let's try different experiments and let's see who joins what civil associations.

464
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.500
and then we can just have mechanisms for settling disagreements between those civil associations”

465
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.500
NARRATOR:  Whether or not anarchists should utilize politics to try to shrink the state is a hotly debated topic.

466
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.500
Recently. on the federal level we got a right to try bill. which says that if you are suffering from a terminal disease

467
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.500
and there's some experimental drug you might be able to take. we're going to give you the option to take it.

468
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.500
But that began on the state level. as a series of states began introducing right to try laws. Now there's no

469
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.500
authorization for a right to try law on the national law. They were just doing it. and as it turns out. they paved the way

470
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.500
for a liberation that occurred on the national level. and you can go down the Tenth Amendment Center.

471
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.500
you can go down the list of the various initiatives they have and you'll see how many of them there are on such a wide array

472
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.500
of issues that might appeal to both left and right. If I look through the history of so-called states rights in the first

473
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.500
let's say 150 years of American history. what do I find it being used for well? I find it being used to defend the freedom of speech.

474
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.500
to defend against unconstitutional searches and seizures. to defend against a military draft during the War of 1812.

475
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.500
that was proposed that some people like congressman and then senator Daniel Webster thought was unconstitutional.

476
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:44.500
but in fact they were even used to fight against slavery. And we see that not only in the personal liberty laws

477
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:55.500
which were used to fight against the Fugitive Slave laws that existed in the 19th century. We have states

478
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.500
for example. refusing to allow the federal government to use its facilities. to use its its jails to hold suspects

479
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.500
or to let any state official take part in running after a fugitive slave or anything like that.

480
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:18.500
The whole thing is. the principle of secession. I think is very very good. I sort of lean toward the nonviolent approach.

481
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.500
but I always support secession. and I think the founding founders made a mistake by not having that in the Constitution.

482
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.500
because that would have restrained the government. If we could have as individual states leave the United States

483
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.500
anytime we want. they would have been much more reserved in the abuse

484
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.500
of the rights that the states should have and the rights of the individuals within the states.

485
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.500
Secession is an approach you take when you have irreconcilable differences. that's in fact what happens.

486
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.500
Right now in the United States we have well over 300 million people. and we are divided right down the middle

487
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.500
in how we look at the world. We have radically different world views. and instead of saying why don't we work on an arrangement

488
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.500
where people who think one way can just live according to those ideas and people who think another way can live that way?”

489
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.500
Instead we feel like we have to win and triumph over our enemies. “Well. there has to be one way to think

490
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.500
that dominates the entire country.” And at some point you should ask yourself “is that really the most civilized

491
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.500
way for us to organize society? Is that the most civilized way for human beings to live with each other?”

492
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:37.500
And I'm inclined to think that it would be better if we said “look we we just don't have the same vision for what society ought to be.

493
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.500
and instead of every four years having a low-intensity civil war with each other to see who's going to ram ideas down the throats of the others?”

494
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.500
What if we say “why don't you live your way we'll live our way we'll see. you know. let the best man win” kind of thing?

495
01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:49.502
.

496
01:04:49.503 --> 01:04:49.504
.

497
01:04:49.505 --> 01:04:49.506
.

498
01:04:49.507 --> 01:04:49.508
.

499
01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:49.510
.

500
01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:49.512
.

501
01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:49.516
.

502
01:04:49.517 --> 01:04:49.518
.

503
01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:49.520
.

504
01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:49.522
.

505
01:04:49.523 --> 01:04:49.524
.

506
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.500
I think the idea that all people just “keep voting for someone who's better than the last clown that was in there”

507
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.500
or the. you know. “we just got to wait for the Republican or Democrat systems to reform themselves and offer us some new candidates”

508
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.500
that clearly isn't working. People have been trying that for a really long time now. and so I think if you're disgusted

509
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.500
by the current system. and you agree the current system is crazy. the very least you can do is stop legitimizing it by

510
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.500
voting every two or four years. because that's really the fig-leaf that they hide behind is to say

511
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.500
“oh well this system is voluntary in a sense. because look these leaders were democratically elected.”

512
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.500
So. I would just say I do believe most of the victories you're likely to have are going to come at your local level.

513
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.500
You have no chance of influencing the US Senate to do anything. but on your local level. well you could. you know.

514
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.500
you might even know your local state legislator. I mean he might actually live on your street.

515
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.500
There is a possibility that you could get some tax repealed or some onerous regulation repealed.

516
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.500
The next level of libertarianism below that would be minarchism Ayn Rand. Robert Nozick. and there they

517
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.500
support the non-aggression principle. but they allow government. very minimal government. to have

518
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.500
armies. courts. and police. Armies. not to export democracy. but to just make sure bad guys don't come from abroad and

519
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.500
attack us. Police. not to make people virtuous. but to just make sure that murderers and rapists don't do their

520
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.500
thing. and leave victimless criminals alone. like prostitution and drugs.

521
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.500
Everybody's a minarchist. you know. who's not an anarchist. Joseph Stalin was a minarchist. Bernie Sanders

522
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.500
is a minarchist. if you're just gonna say “well I think the state should do XYZ” well why not XYZ and ABC.

523
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.500
and while we're at it EFG. It's a whole bunch of other things. I mean. either you're you're guided by first principles.

524
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.500
or you're not. and you're just in the realm of preferences. And you know anarchists get accused of being utopian

525
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.500
but there is nothing more utopian than a minarchist. The idea that a state will stay restrained

526
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.500
because it just decides it “doesn't want more power.” “We're gonna create a monopoly on the initiation of violence”

527
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.500
and they'll probably decide “we'll only stay. you know. a certain reasonable size.” Well. I mean. how much empirical evidence

528
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.500
do you need to disprove the idea that that's even possible? And in fact there is a pretty strong correlation

529
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.500
between relatively small states becoming the biggest states. It's not a coincidence that the United States of America

530
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.500
which started as this experiment in restrained government with all these brilliant thinkers who wrote all about checks

531
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.500
and balances. and divisions of power.. Well. now it's the biggest state that's ever existed in the history of humanity.

532
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.500
The most effective strategy for bringing about a stateless society is not politics at all. I don't think we're gonna send

533
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.500
our prayers up in the voting booth and hope that the authorities grant us this kind of supreme freedom.

534
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.500
NARRATOR:  Markets are the most common way for people to meet their needs. Many anarchist theories

535
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.500
have offered market solutions for services that are often defined as public goods. such as law. defense. security. and education.

536
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:15.500
The entrepreneur is sort of the fundamental agent who drives forward the market economy. right. You know. look at

537
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.500
all the goods and services that we have around us. The chairs we're sitting in. this building in which we're

538
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.500
doing this recording. the equipment. the camera. and computers and so forth that we're using. Where did all those

539
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.500
things come from? They have to be produced by human beings. right. who exercise forethought and planning

540
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.500
and have a deliberate purpose. and use their ingenuity and so forth to come up with ways. you know. to convert

541
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.500
the inputs that are given by nature. natural resources and land and energy. and then human labour and so forth.

542
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.500
Those have to be converted or transformed into iPhones and buildings and automobiles and food that we can eat

543
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:06.500
and so forth. So the entrepreneurial function is this taking command of resources. and making them into stuff that you can try to

544
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.500
offer to consumers in the future. not knowing for sure whether you'll be successful or not. If you are successful.

545
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.500
if you're good at anticipating future conditions. you can produce a thing that consumers will want and will pay

546
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.500
more than what it costs you to make the thing. and you're in a profit. If you're unsuccessful. you earn a loss.

547
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.500
It’s this constant pursuit of profit and desire to avoid loss that animates the process of production and makes

548
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.500
all this stuff around us available. As Ludwig von Mises said “it is impossible to picture a market economy

549
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.500
or to have a picture of a market economy without the entrepreneur.”

550
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.500
This agent. this agency. constantly pushing and promoting and moving the economy forward.

551
01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.500
Technology is a good example of that. where companies are having to hire all sorts of specialized labor

552
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.500
to interact with one another. to try to come up with improvements in the product or improvements in production.

553
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:18.500
and so that's that's the order that anarchy brings. because it is all based on voluntary activities that

554
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.500
are meant to be efficient and meant to be productive and meant to be mutually beneficial.

555
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.500
That's what's really ironic about that perennial question of “who will build the roads”. is in the current system

556
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.500
it's not usually that it's literal employees of the state who are building roads.

557
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.500
it's just the state has contracts and they farm it out to various bidders.

558
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.500
As it is now poor people pay for the roads even though they never use them or never go anywhere. but people who

559
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.500
maybe higher income and travel a lot around the metro area. or travel to tourist spots and so on they're using those roads more.

560
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.500
If you turned those into toll roads. they'd have to pay more and then they would be annoyed by that.

561
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.500
whereas right now. you're charging grandma to pay for that road that she never ever uses cuz she's like a shut-in.

562
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.500
And so that evens out the cost. then for people.

563
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.500
On the I-10. which is a big highway that goes past New Orleans all the way from Florida to California. the minimum speed is 40

564
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:26.500
and the maximum speed is 70. Well maybe it would be better if the speed in this lane was 50. and 65. and 80.

565
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.500
Would that reduce deaths? I don't know! All I know is if different people try different things… Now on your road

566
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:47.500
you're gonna make it 60. 70. and 80. and on someone else's road. it's gonna be 65. 70. and 75 maximum speed. Which one is better?I don't know!

567
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:59.500
I think that just as Ben Franklin set up a private firefighting service. there's no reason at all that all the fire departments.

568
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.500
which also engage in a form of protection. need to be government.

569
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.500
NARRATOR:  Private education solutions include private schools. tutoring. homeschooling. and unschooling.

570
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.500
We have the idea that “Well. you know. every child deserves an education. it's impossible to imagine the market

571
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.500
providing that level of education. therefore it needs to be provided by local. state. national government. etc…”

572
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.500
“Education is a special kind of a good.” People will say “well. maybe the market can produce toothpaste

573
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.500
in appropriate quantities and qualities but not education. Education is a different kind of a thing. It's a so-called public good.

574
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.500
can't be provided by the market. must be provided by the state. and we have to require that every student get this education

575
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.500
and that's why we have compulsory attendance laws.” Ok look. I'm a professional educator. Do I think education in the abstract is important?

576
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:04.500
You bet I do. but education is not a thing. right. there's not just one homogeneous blob of “Education” where everybody

577
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:14.500
gets one unit of education or no education. right. education is just like any other good or service on the market. right.

578
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:22.500
We don't actually consume “education”. something in the abstract. but we read books. we attend classes.

579
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.500
we. and as adults. right. you can hire a consultant to educate you on something. you can watch a documentary film like this one

580
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.500
and educate yourself. you can read a book. you can talk to somebody. you can participate in a discussion group.

581
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.500
you can go online. right. There are all kinds of ways that we get educated. but the things we consume are specific.

582
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.500
discrete. marginal units of a thing that I read. or a lecture that I heard. or whatever. and you know. are those things

583
01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:00.500
bought and sold in markets? Yeah. ask amazon.com or any you know. or Hollywood. or a college or university.

584
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.500
a for-profit college university or school. Of course people buy educational goods and services all the time.

585
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:16.500
The current government educational system emphasizes a general curriculum where everybody learns the same thing.

586
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.500
So you have survey courses in college on Western civilization. right. Everybody learns the same thing. and you're told

587
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:31.500
what to think about it. and also conveniently. studying the course of Western civilization which is important.

588
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:41.500
But you're told what to think and you are not told about the key factors of the rise of Western civilization.

589
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.500
which is private property. free markets. and sound money. Those you know. if you taken those classes. I took a couple

590
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:59.500
when I was in college Western Civ one in Western Civ two. and inflation was mentioned once. even though it's the thing

591
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.500
that brings down civilizations time after time. and so getting back to that I think you know

592
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.500
people would be exposed to great ideas they would appreciate great ideas and even think for themselves.

593
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:23.500
NARRATOR:  Private alternatives for criminal justice are gaining popularity due to the inefficiency and unreliability of state courts and police.

594
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.500
Private dispute resolution is a multi-billion dollar industry and much of the security in society is already produced privately.

595
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.500
in the form of security firms. neighborhood watch groups. and private gun ownership.

596
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:43.500
Courts can be private. We see that every day in private adjudication systems. in arbitration systems.

597
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.500
police. we see that every day in the form of security. private security. at places like Disneyland. and as far as national defense goes.

598
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.500
I think it's largely a myth. I don't think that the rest of the world is particularly looking to come invade America.

599
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:04.500
and even if it was. I think that the notion that security could be provided on the marketplace is something that's

600
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.500
absolutely tenable in that that we need to look at. Well. I think there would be lawyers even in a free society.

601
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.500
I think there would still be conflicts. I think there would still be contracts that would occasionally be breached.

602
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.500
I think there would still be disputes between neighbors. disputes amongst. in business. I think there's a lot of ways

603
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.500
in which lawyers would still be a thing in a private society. Might still have a market function in drafting contracts

604
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.500
and representing people in what we would hope would be some form of common law courts. or private courts. or private arbitration.

605
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:47.500
Well. for normals or police services. I think the way people would think of it nowadays. just with private agencies

606
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.500
fulfilling those services. and notice the big difference here is there would be competition. So right now. if just imagine a grocery store.

607
01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.500
they hired an agency to crack down on shoplifting. Some kid puts a steak under his. you know. under his coat pocket.

608
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.500
he starts around the door. and the agency goes and tackles him and breaks his legs or shoots him cold dead.

609
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.500
that would be bad for business. That particular agency would go out of business. and so over time you would see police.

610
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.500
what we think of as the job of the police. would be handled by competing private firms in a very efficient but also humane manner.

611
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:35.500
You didn't have prisons for example. in earlier societies. which were much less state oriented than the ones today.

612
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:44.500
Prisons are a relatively recent development. Britain. I think was the first to have them in the 18th century.

613
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.500
NARRATOR:  The idea of private defense services was first suggested by Gustav de Molinari in his 1849 essay “The Production Of Security”

614
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.500
When we think about the private provision of military defense. it's important to always use an apples-to-apples comparison.

615
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.500
So it's true that a relatively small city. no matter what they did. wouldn't be able to repel Nazi Germany for example.

616
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.500
but by the same token. neither did France. and France used a conventional state military to defend itself and it lost.

617
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.500
So the claim from the anarchist camp is always that for a given group of people. other things equal. they will be able to

618
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:27.500
better defend themselves if their defense is left to voluntary market provision. than if the government monopolizes

619
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.500
and tries to take over that enterprise. So as far as a city of twenty five thousand people defending themselves.

620
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:42.500
we don't know exactly what they would do. but the point is any money they spent on missile defense or other types of defense

621
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.500
would be better spent because we can see governments notoriously spend way too much on. you know. military procurement.

622
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.500
the amount they spend for a given missile or bullets or whatnot is more than the private sector analog would be.

623
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.500
So for a given amount of expenditure. a smaller society of truly free people would get more bang for their buck as it were.

624
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:14.500
Also the issue is they wouldn't be an offensive threat to anybody. so there would be no reason for a state to want to invade them.

625
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.500
except perhaps for the ideological one that it's awkward that there's this free society that's prospering. But in terms of

626
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.500
why is it the government's largely go to war with each other? Just like Switzerland. for example. was able to go

627
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.500
through both world wars relatively unscathed. and it's partly because everybody knows they're not a threat to us.

628
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:43.500
The problem with the state provision of military defense among other issues. is that it limits the brainstorming to

629
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.500
just a few people who are in the military hierarchy and maybe some of the political figures involved as well.

630
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:57.500
and whereas a genuine open market relies on the contributions and the insights of the whole community.

631
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.500
And so when you have the state running your defense. you're putting all your eggs in one basket.

632
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.500
and that was shown for example. most famously with France and the Maginot Line. you know during World War two.

633
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:17.500
where that sort of system wouldn't have occurred like that under private provision. where as yet. one company thought

634
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.500
“oh let's just really have these strong fortifications but some other company might say that's not a good idea let's try

635
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.500
you know having these other systems to repel invaders. And so that's really the benefit of having competition

636
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.500
when it comes to military defense. is that's the last place in the world you want to have one agency with one plan

637
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.500
and if the plan doesn't work. then your country gets taken over.

638
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.500
NARRATOR:  Entrepreneurial innovation has done more to diminish state power than most political action.

639
01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:01.500
Number one. 3d printers. right? CNC millers. ghost gunners. These are great. great options for people who want to

640
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.500
be able to defend themselves but not have to register with the state or go onto a government list. That's one of my favorites.

641
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.500
Also cryptocurrency miners. right? Just if you were mining for Bitcoin. you're engaging in counter economics.

642
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:24.500
because you're helping people avoid the banking cartel. Also Tor. Look at what Tor has done for people. Providing

643
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:34.500
encryption to protect them from the CIA in the NSA. So if you look at the market. the underground market in “Alongside Night”.

644
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.500
that is the Silk Road. That is what gave Ross the inspiration to create the first truly free and uncensored market.

645
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.500
That's also why the state gave him double life +40.

646
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.500
Narrator:  Anarchism is being spread into mainstream culture in music. comic books. animations. stand-up comedy. film. and video games.

647
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.500
So there's this really interesting thing that happened in Hollywood. you know. John Hughes. very famous director.

648
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:11.500
did a bunch of famous movies in the 1980s when I was coming of age. It was sixteen Candles. Breakfast Club.

649
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:21.500
movies like that. they're really popular with Gen Xers like me. and those movies. I think invariably poked fun at principals and teachers

650
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.500
in schools as sort of these lame authoritarian figures. right who the heroes the movie would sort of. the whole movie

651
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.500
about them sort of escaping. like Ferris Bueller's Day Off. right. That’s a classic example of that. right.

652
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.500
NARRATOR:  Comic book creator Jack Lloyd had discovered that crowdfunding and on demand

653
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.500
publishing was a recipe for successfully delivering entertainment and a principled message to audiences.

654
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:52.500
When I was finishing up law school. I was kind of just killing some time thinking about what I'd like to do as relates to my passions.

655
01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.500
which involved the comic book world. and also you know promoting Liberty. I started to write it and put it together and format it

656
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.500
and then think about what I could do for a pitch. and then I worked with an artist to create the initial sketches

657
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:15.500
and I put that together for presentation IndieGoGo. and from there you know “Voluntaryist” kind of took off.

658
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.500
I'm also working with a lot of multimedia organizations to produce a lot of good libertarian content. and I'm quite

659
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.500
interested in producing a video game. This has been a fascinating thing for me lately. Somebody made a meme

660
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.500
where they said like you know “Fortnite gets 400.000 people to play it every day. or something and the Libertarian Party

661
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.500
gets so few votes.” and I was like it's a great point. Why do we not communicate our philosophy through more modern enjoyable means?

662
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.500
Why can't we sell it through entertainment? Some people would want to do. you know not everybody's down for a dry philosophical

663
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.500
discussion. not everybody's down to argue economics like we are. but everybody likes video games. dude.

664
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:58.500
NARRATOR:  Libertarian ideas are being brought to a wide audience by artists like Tomasz Kaye. Kaye earned acclaim for his animation “George Ought To Help”.

665
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.500
ANIMATION NARRATOR:  You want to help Oliver out so you give him some money.

666
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:18.500
To your surprise. George doesn't offer Oliver any help. You try to persuade him. but it's no use. Imagining yourself in this situation.

667
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.500
do you think it's okay to threaten to use physical force against George to get him to do the right thing?

668
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:34.500
Now imagine a slightly different situation. This time. a group of your friends take a vote

669
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:45.500
six out of ten are in favor of threatening George to get him to help Oliver. Does this democratic process make it okay to threaten George?”

670
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.500
NARRATOR:  In 2017. BackWordz. a new metal band. released “Veracity”. filled with anarchist themed lyrics.

671
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.500
The album spent many weeks on Billboard's metal album chart peaking at number 20.

672
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:18.500
♪ ♪ ♪[Music] ♪ ♪ ♪

673
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.500
That was our first album. Veracity. and it was a hit. I would have never imagined that it would've got big as it did.

674
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.500
but now we're gonna be a lot more. alright. you know we had. we all come from different backgrounds. and we want to make sure

675
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.500
we express that. So we've already pretty much announced that it will be sort of this like double-sided type of deal.

676
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.500
We had 18 tracks the first album. so our upcoming album we’re gonna have roughly like 20 and stuff like that.

677
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.500
So we're gonna. between our first two albums we’ll put out. we're gonna put out more music than you know people

678
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.500
that have three albums out. you know three four albums. but this time we're trying to just get a little more. you know.

679
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.500
just. just mix it up a little bit and I love it. I love the process and also obviously with us being able to talk about whatever we talked about.

680
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.500
because we don't have any strings attached to us. right. It's a lovely thing. A lot of closet. definitely in metal core.

681
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.500
even though it seems to be a lot. a really leftist dominated sort of sub-genre. there's a lot of closet libertarians in it

682
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.500
because they're like “well if I come out and say some of that”. man that's basically the end of their career.

683
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:36.500
And this is why I think they're so attracted to us and why and I talk about all the time about the void that we just simply fill. and just being for us.

684
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.500
The people who come up to us like “man you make music that I enjoy. but man you adopt the philosophy that I adopt”.

685
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.500
and that's what takes it to another level. And again. there's people in these bands that are kind of closeted.

686
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.500
but again. it's like they don't think that it's worth putting themselves out there like that just simply because.

687
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.500
yeah. you get a target on your back. you get a target on your back because it's against the norm in the industry.

688
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:08.500
NARRATOR:  Stand-up comic Dave Smith brought his comedy to podcasting in 2012. eventually hosting his popular podcast “Part Of The Problem”.

689
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.500
He then made the jump from stage to screen as A regular on cable news shows. and in his own comedy special

690
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.500
“Libertas”. which spent three weeks at the number-one spot on iTunes.

691
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:28.500
They went “oh why do they hate us?” That’s how clueless we were. We didn’t even know there was a beef. Like if you had

692
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.500
asked us on September 10th. you were “oh. what do Muslims think about America?” “That we’re awesome. I don’t know.

693
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.500
what else would they think?” And then September 11th happened. and people were like “WOAH. why do they hate us?”

694
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.500
And then people are like “well you know. you've been bombing the shit out of them for decades.” And we were like “what?”

695
01:27:49.000 --> 01:28:00.500
I'm obsessed with libertarianism. and so when I'm doing comedy it just kind of comes out. and having the perspective of

696
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:09.500
being an anarcho-capitalist it gives me a different angle than just about any other comedian has on the topic of politics

697
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.500
or government or even culture. and there's just a lot of golden material there. There's nothing that that's more absurd and hilarious

698
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.500
than the idea of the state. and it's something that everybody accepts and that's like comedy gold.

699
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.500
NARRATOR:  Anarchists utilize podcasting and memes to spread messages. further bypassing corporate media.

700
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.500
I was trying to figure out a way that I could contribute to the Liberty movement. so I just decided to podcast.

701
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.500
I had been in music at one point and I understood recording. so I bought some very basic equipment

702
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.500
and I laid out about 15 episodes of my basics of voluntarism and libertarianism. and just started.

703
01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.500
I never learned about guns. so I cover guns a lot in my channel and the content that I do. Now I love firearms and

704
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:09.500
I love learning about it more. but growing up it was something that I never had experience in terms of culture.

705
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:17.500
or anyone in my family. or anyone around me. One of the biggest things that  we're doing next and this partnership together.

706
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:27.500
is we're focusing on dispelling a lot of the myths that are being perpetuated in the media against gun owners specifically.

707
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:36.500
I was making memes for all different types of groups and pages on my own accord. because I just had some technical skill in Photoshop.

708
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:47.500
and you know just you know like entertaining people. but it really started to take off when I was invited to join the Anarchy ball team back in 2013.

709
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.500
Memes reach anybody and everybody. You see. memes are obviously popular with younger people. but even older people.

710
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.500
boomer memes. you know. They're getting into it too. and it's just to see it. They’re little seeds that float all over the place.

711
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.500
and they just spike right into people's minds. and even if it's something that they disagree with in the meme. because

712
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.500
you know usually memes are pretty extreme with the idea that they're trying to get across. and it bothers people

713
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.500
or people really resonate with it. but it sticks in their head and that's what I like a lot. That and it's funny.

714
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:28.500
Throughout history. there have always been populations that live outside the reach of states. In Southeast Asia.

715
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:35.500
millions thrive without a state to manage their lives. James C Scott discussed these anarchist communities extensively

716
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.500
in his book “The Art Of Not Being Governed” I'm a South East Asianist. and I was interested in the history and the relationships

717
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:52.500
between hill people in Southeast Asia and lowland people. and the states exist in the lowlands. and historically

718
01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:01.500
one thought that the people in the hills were in a sense the ancestors of the people who founded States. That they were the backward.

719
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:13.500
less-advanced. had not discovered rice. agriculture. and Buddhism. and so on. and it turns out that it's much more complicated

720
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.500
and much more interesting story than that. That the. and here we're talking about an area of maybe a hundred million people

721
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:32.500
spread all the way from the northern boundaries of Vietnam and the hills. through Thailand. Laos. Burma. all into northeast India.

722
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:41.500
and I contend. and I think the evidence is indisputable at this point. that historically most of the hills were populated

723
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:52.500
by people who were not always there. but ran away from states in the valleys. because of taxes. because of epidemics. because of wars.

724
01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:08.500
conscription. and so on. And there they were. if you like. fleeing States. and therefore and they did. one of the things that they did

725
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:16.500
was to create social structures that prevented States from arising among them. It's not that they didn't have order.

726
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.500
it’s not that they didn't have Chiefs. but they had a whole system of preventing state formations.

727
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.500
NARRATOR: In Cheran Mexico. citizens abolished all political parties and disbanded the police.

728
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.500
It's so very great. very chill environment right now. and if you compare it to something to an event in United States or Western Europe

729
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.500
any place in the “first world”. well there's little to no security at all. and even that could make you wonder

730
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.500
“what if there's a smart lost soul out there that would think of harming everyone in any way?”

731
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.500
And that is easy. that's not gonna happen because of one simple reason. You don't know who has a gun here.

732
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:16.500
(IN SPANISH)

733
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.500
NARRATOR:  In 2014. the Mexican Supreme Court ruled their system of government as constitutional. effectively ending

734
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.500
a four year long fight against political parties getting back into the community. It was a significant victory that validated their efforts to rebuild.

735
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.500
To do so it must build a thriving economy buoyed by lucrative exports and stable local businesses.

736
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.500
(IN SPANISH)

737
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:14.500
NARRATOR:  Mutual aid is a practice that combines individualism with collectivism to meet the needs of working people.

738
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.500
People in a locale pool resources to help each other when temporary help is needed.

739
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:28.500
These are very old structures. Mutual aid societies have been with us since the time of the Masons. the Elks.

740
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:36.500
and all manner of other aid organizations where people came together looked after each other throughout human history.

741
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.500
and in fact there were at one point one third of the U.S. population at the peak of these arrangements was a member

742
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:53.500
of a mutual aid society. So the fact that these disappeared. came about for a couple of reasons. The first was that

743
01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.500
the welfare state really was ascendant in the 20th century and these associations were crowded out.

744
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.500
People could no longer afford to both pay taxes and be members of these organizations and hope to get benefits out of it.

745
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.500
Instead. they became dependent on the centralized welfare state.

746
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.500
ANIMATION NARRATOR:  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries. one of the primary sources of health care and

747
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.500
health insurance for the working poor in Britain. Australia. and the United States. was the fraternal society.

748
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.500
Fraternal societies. or friendly societies. in Britain and Australia. were voluntary mutual aid associations. Over one-quarter

749
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:43.500
of all American adults were members of fraternal societies in 1920. Fraternal societies were particularly popular among blacks and immigrants.

750
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:51.500
A fraternal Society was a group of working-class people who formed an association and paid monthly fees into the associations fund.

751
01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:00.500
Individual members would then be able to draw on the pooled resources in times of need. There were a great many societies to choose from.

752
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.500
Their most commonly offered services were life insurance. disability insurance. and lodge practice. Lodge practice meant

753
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.500
that the lodge would retain a doctor to provide medical care to its members. Members would pay a yearly fee

754
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.500
and then call on the doctor services as needed. If members were unhappy with the doctor. the contract might not be renewed.

755
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.500
Most remarkable. was the low cost at which these medical services were provided. At the turn of the century.

756
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.500
an average worker’s daily wage would pay for a year's worth of medical care. Much cheaper than on the regular market.

757
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.500
yet licensed physicians competed vigorously for large contracts perhaps because of the security they offered.

758
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.500
This competition kept members costs low. The response of the medical establishment both in America and in Britain

759
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.500
was one of outrage. Many saw it as a blow to the dignity of the profession that trained physicians should be eagerly bidding

760
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.500
for the chance to serve lower-class tradesmen. Such low fees. many doctors complained.

761
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.500
were bankrupting the medical profession. Socially inferior people were setting physicians fees.

762
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:19.500
(NARRATOR) Voluntaryism In Action. a philanthropic organization. raised over 250.000 dollars in 2019 for hundreds of people in need.

763
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:28.500
Food Not Bombs is a decentralized nonprofit organization that feeds the homeless. Food Not Bombs continues to expand

764
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.500
to their local outreach and service. Don't Comply is an open carry organization based in Texas. For nine years. they've

765
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.500
hosted the annual Feed The Need Drive. where they issue food and blankets to the homeless. Based in Philadelphia.

766
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.500
Black Guns Matter. is a grassroots gun organization that teaches nonviolent conflict resolution and firearms safety.

767
01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:00.500
I started Black GunsMatter because we saw a need. a serious deficiency in Second Amendment information.

768
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.500
firearms safety training and education. and just the general. you know understanding. that *we* run this. That we the people.

769
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.500
especially in urban demographics. so I wanted Black Guns Matter to reflect that. To give people an understanding of that.

770
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.500
And then it kept snowballing and we've gotten larger and larger. and more people are down with us.

771
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:28.500
The leaders. whether they’re law enforcement. and when I say leader. I mean a woman or man that is doing positive things

772
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:37.500
for and with and in the community. whether they’re politicians or whether they’re clergymen. and women or whether they.

773
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.500
you know just OG guys that did some time. got some credibility.

774
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.500
They love what we’re doing. they think. they know what time it is. they know the racist routes of gun control.

775
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:59.500
NARRATOR:  As the state expands. it's easy to forget that everything the state does coercively was once done voluntarily for ourselves and each other.

776
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.500
(THADDEUS RUSSELL) If you're interested in individual liberty and personal freedom. I would say the most important thing

777
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.500
is learning yourself. learning what you want. I think some people don't want freedom. some people don't want personal liberty.

778
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.500
Some people want to be told what to do. some people want to be regimented. some people want to be cogs in the machine.

779
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.500
or work in a cubicle for a boss. or be a member of an army. and there's nothing we can do about that. That's just their values.

780
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.500
right. So. you have to decide what your values are. What do you value in life? Do you value the freedom to move your body

781
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.500
wherever you want to move it however you want to move it?

782
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.500
Do you value the freedom to say whatever you want to say whenever you want to say it?

783
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.500
You don't have to worry about having a huge number. you don't have to get 50 or 60 percent of the people to agree.

784
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.500
you just need about 10 percent of the people who are energetic and are thought leaders. and put the information out.

785
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:06.500
I think once you convinced enough people that a free society would work. it would be preferable to the current one.

786
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:14.500
Whatever particular mechanism is used to get there. it's just gonna be a whole lot easier. whether it's seasteading or secession.

787
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:23.500
If you were to tell somebody in 1840 that we were going to abolish slavery across the West in the next 25 years.

788
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.500
it would have seemed crazy. People worried “who would pick the cotton?” Just like they worry today “Who will build the roads?”

789
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.500
But we can go to a much better place. we can actually be morally consistent. You don't have to live in this world where
