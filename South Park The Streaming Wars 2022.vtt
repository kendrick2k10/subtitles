-(car horn honks)
-(indistinct chatter)

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:16.484
MULLHULLAND:
Citizens of Denver.

5
00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:19.787
we are in the middle
of an environmental crisis.

6
00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.723
The winters are bringing
less and less snow.

7
00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.293
And now. we are facing a drought

8
00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:28.529
due to the effects
of Global ManBearPig.

9
00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.030
-A drought?
-(overlapping chatter)

10
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:32.166
-What? No.
-ManBearPig?
-What? ManBearPig?

11
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.003
ALL of Denver's water comes from
streams up in the mountains.

12
00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:39.740
but now. ManBearPig
has decimated these areas

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.343
and wreaked havoc
on the upper mountain streams.

14
00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:45.413
And so. effective immediately.

15
00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:46.914
we are declaring a drought

16
00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.183
and cutting back
on all the city's water.

17
00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.985
-No!
-You can't do that!
-(overlapping shouting)

18
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.555
What about our
homeowners' association rules?

19
00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.958
Some of us are required
to have nice. green lawns.

20
00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.393
You expect us to have

21
00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.828
-nice. brown lawns?
-(overlapping shouting)

22
00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:04.565
I own 12 golf courses
in the Denver Metro area.

23
00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.268
You're not cutting down
on my damn water.

24
00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:10.338
Have you all forgotten
about the Pi Pi?

25
00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.574
I have Denver's
largest water park.

26
00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:16.777
All water parks are 50% pee

27
00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.247
and 50% water.

28
00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:21.915
You-you can't forget
about a Pi Pi.

29
00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.785
Nobody wants to lose the water.
but we're in a drought.

30
00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.787
-(shouting stops)
-MULHULLAND: There simply isn't

31
00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.757
enough water coming to Denver
from up in the mountains.

32
00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:31.692
And the water up there
is being used

33
00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.361
for farms and agriculture.

34
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.730
What kind of agriculture?

35
00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:39.733
* *

36
00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:44.272
* Da. da. da. da.
da. da. da. da *

37
00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:45.573
* Da. da. da. da. *

38
00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.208
How's it looking?

39
00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:49.510
They still look dry.

40
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.646
Okay. then I'm gonna
open the reserves.

41
00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.583
* If you ain't taking care
of business *

42
00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:59.287
* This you must expect... *

43
00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:01.121
Yeah!

44
00:02:01.222 --> 00:02:03.857
* When it's wet *

45
00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.127
* Oh. come on... *

46
00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:09.463
(laughing)

47
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.268
* Oh! *

48
00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.270
* Come on *

49
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.739
* Oh! Yeah *

50
00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.675
* Slippery when it's wet *

51
00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.445
* Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo *

52
00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:26.647
* Slippery when it's wet *

53
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.417
* Slippery. slippery *

54
00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:31.285
* Slippery when it's wet. *

55
00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.621
* *

56
00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:41.061
(overlapping chatter. laughter)

57
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.464
CARTMAN:
Yeah. and so.
and so then. so then

58
00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:44.998
Clyde said that if a chick
uses hairspray.

59
00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.934
you can actually
light her head on fire.

60
00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:48.469
Nuh-uh.

61
00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.738
Yeah-huh. Tolkien.
You guys want to see?

62
00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:52.306
Kenny. do you have matches?

63
00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.675
Yeah. of course I have matches.

64
00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.577
Check this out. you guys.

65
00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.516
-BUS DRIVER: Eric Cartman.
-(bus brakes)

66
00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.352
Eric Cartman.

67
00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:06.554
What? You're ruining it.

68
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:09.223
This is your stop.

69
00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:12.960
Oh. Right.

70
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.962
Scuse-scuse me.

71
00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:22.102
Hey. Hey. guys.

72
00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.473
You want to come hang out
at my house for a bit?

73
00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.476
Uh. no. that's cool.

74
00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.878
It's not my fault
that my mom lost her job

75
00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:33.414
and we had to move. you guys.
It's really not so bad.

76
00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.049
Uh. yeah. maybe some other time.

77
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.685
CARTMAN:
My house is cool. you guys.

78
00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.388
-Kenny. you want to come chill?
-I'm cool. dude.

79
00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:43.591
It's still way better
than your house. Kenny!

80
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.893
'Cause your family's poor!

81
00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:49.830
Your family's poor. Kenny.

82
00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:56.304
Hi. honey. How was school?

83
00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:59.072
Fuck you. Mom.

84
00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.485
You doing anything. Tolkien?

85
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.454
You want to come over
to my house. play a board game?

86
00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:16.023
Oh. um.
I should probably go home.

87
00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.792
Well. okay. you want to play
a game over at your house?

88
00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.894
Yeah. uh. I-I don't know.

89
00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.631
Sorry. I'm just...
not in the best mood. I guess.

90
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:27.301
Hey. are you still worried
about Karen?

91
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.569
Yeah.

92
00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.103
Yeah. me. too.

93
00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.739
But we all have to try
to just be happy. you know?

94
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.541
No matter what happens
with Karen.

95
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.809
You're right. Okay. come on.

96
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.346
RANDY:
Hey.

97
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.315
Stan. where do you think
you're going?

98
00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:43.484
I'm gonna go hang out
at Tolkien's house

99
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:44.585
for a bit. Karen.

100
00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.219
No. you're not.

101
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.221
Yes. I am. Karen.

102
00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:49.557
You better knock that off.

103
00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:51.525
I don't want you
playing with Tolkien.

104
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.160
Karen. just come back inside.

105
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.396
I've told you
I don't want our son

106
00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:56.864
hanging out with those people.

107
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.633
And exactly what do you mean
by "those people"?

108
00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.201
I mean traitors

109
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.572
who I hired to give my weed
more street cred.

110
00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:07.307
and then go out and open
their own weed business.

111
00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:09.309
You're not the only weed grower
in this valley.

112
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.845
But I was supposed to be
the only Black one.

113
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.648
WATER COMMISSIONER:
Excuse me.

114
00:05:16.384 --> 00:05:18.318
You the owners of these farms?

115
00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.320
I own Tegridy Weed.

116
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:22.790
the original marijuana farm
on this street.

117
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.858
Okay. and your name is...

118
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.127
His name is Karen Marsh.

119
00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:30.931
You better get that fucking name
out your fucking mouth.

120
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.668
Well. gentlemen.
I'm the Water Commissioner.

121
00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:37.905
Colorado Division
of Water Resources.

122
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.441
I'm here to find out
exactly what's going on

123
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:43.343
with the city's water. Weed?

124
00:05:43.444 --> 00:05:45.012
The city's water?

125
00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:47.648
Well. you see. the water here
is supposed to make its way

126
00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.684
to all the thirsty people
down in Denver.

127
00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.053
And. uh...

128
00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.356
Well. there's a lot
of thirsty people down there.

129
00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:58.426
I just want to see
how much you farmers

130
00:05:58.526 --> 00:05:59.793
are actually using.

131
00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.228
Okay. well. we can show you...

132
00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:03.230
Well. you should check
out his fucking farm.

133
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.499
If you're. if you're gonna
check out anyone's water.

134
00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.700
it should be his.

135
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.837
All right. maybe I'll do that.

136
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.272
(car door opens. closes)

137
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.408
(engine starts)

138
00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:24.518
CARTMAN:
* I live in a hot dog *

139
00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:27.721
* On a lonely old hill *

140
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.558
* People make fun of me *

141
00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:33.761
* And that's not cool *

142
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.997
* I'm isolated from my friends *

143
00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.467
* Against my will *

144
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.736
* My possessions
are now condiments *

145
00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:45.172
* And that is not cool *

146
00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:48.241
* And I don't want
to live like this *

147
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.745
* You don't know how I feel *

148
00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.981
* I've got no room to grow *

149
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.651
* And it is just so not cool *

150
00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.154
* Just once in my life.
I'd like cool stuff to happen *

151
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.792
* Everything keeps changing.
and I'm not adapting *

152
00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:08.195
* I'm crying like a girl.
and it's super not cool *

153
00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:12.199
* And I just want
something cool to happen *

154
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.735
* To me *

155
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.870
* I've lived through such pain *

156
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.639
* The word's been so cruel *

157
00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:21.675
* Something's got to happen.
something that's cool *

158
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:26.580
* I just want something cool
to happen... *

159
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.381
This is it. right here.

160
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.023
* To me. *

161
00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:38.391
REALTOR:
Okay. right this way.
Mr. Cussler.

162
00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:40.628
You are going to love
this property.

163
00:07:40.728 --> 00:07:44.932
It's over 30 acres. and it's
in a real up-and-coming area.

164
00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:47.868
I think you could build
an amazing home here.

165
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:51.371
Yes. Yes. I believe I could.

166
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.907
REALTOR:
Now. it's about an hour commute
from where you are in Denver.

167
00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:56.343
but I think the potential here
is fabulous.

168
00:07:57.578 --> 00:08:00.113
TALNUA CUSSLER:
Oh. yes.

169
00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:03.083
It looks absolutely ideal.

170
00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:04.618
Do you like to entertain?

171
00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.286
Because you could easily build
a ten-bedroom house

172
00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:08.522
on this property.
You could have a dedicated gym.

173
00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:10.057
even a full-size movie theater.

174
00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.192
Full-size movie theater?

175
00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:13.927
If you want. we can walk
around the property.

176
00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.896
-It's a bit muddy. but we can...
-That won't be necessary.

177
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:19.299
I'll take it.
Full asking price. Cash.

178
00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.801
Oh-oh-oh.

179
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.203
Da Da.

180
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.875
-(knock on door)
-Yes. Come in.

181
00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.911
Mom said you wanted to see me.

182
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.913
Yes. Shelley. have a seat.

183
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.816
Close the door. please.

184
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.217
(Randy clears throat)

185
00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:40.588
I've been. uh. wanting
to talk to you. Shelley.

186
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:42.122
Um...

187
00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:45.926
Can you tell me why everyone
is calling me "Karen"?

188
00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:48.929
Don't worry about it.

189
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.464
Well. everybody
keeps calling me Karen.

190
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:53.066
and I don't get it.

191
00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.235
Is it. is it. like.
a joke or something?

192
00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:58.939
"Karen" is a pejorative term
for a white person

193
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.575
who acts overly entitled
and demanding.

194
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.945
Okay. well. that's fucked up.

195
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.514
Don't you think that's
a little. like. sexist?

196
00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:08.949
I didn't start it.

197
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:09.983
Well. who did?

198
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.184
The Internet.

199
00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.654
So-so now somebody is a Karen

200
00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:16.456
just 'cause they want
to be treated with some respect?

201
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.693
I deserve to not have people
walk all over me. okay?

202
00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:23.030
I have the right to call
the cops when things happen.

203
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.932
That's fine. Karen.

204
00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.334
Shelley. I deserve to not have--

205
00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:29.502
What the fuck is he doing here?

206
00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:31.939
Hey. Hey. hey. hey.

207
00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:36.576
Excuse me. this is my property.

208
00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:39.312
Your soil seems very hydrated.

209
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.014
Must be getting lots of water.

210
00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.316
What are you saying.
that I use too much?

211
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:47.154
I use the water that my crops
need and nothing more.

212
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.857
Is that a Slip 'N Slide
over there?

213
00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:55.262
That is an agricultural
Slip 'N Slide. yes.

214
00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:57.798
Apparently. you know nothing
about farming.

215
00:09:57.898 --> 00:10:00.167
Look. if you have
any excess of water.

216
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:03.136
you might actually make some
money. that's all I'm saying.

217
00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:05.172
Make money? Wait. what?

218
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:07.507
You heard of water transfers?

219
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.010
See. you have a lease
to use some of the water

220
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.279
from your stream here.
but what you don't use.

221
00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.481
you could actually sell
the rights to.

222
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.717
I already talked
to your neighbor about it.

223
00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.185
Yeah. well. see. the thing is.

224
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.120
this farm is about Tegridy.

225
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.855
not stupid water rights.

226
00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.257
And if you want to keep
coming here and bugging me.

227
00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.226
then I would like to speak
to your manager

228
00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:27.961
because you are harassing me.

229
00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:30.297
and I am important.

230
00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:34.301
Well. have a nice day. Karen.

231
00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:36.269
It's Randy!

232
00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:39.673
I know what Karen means.
I'm not stupid.

233
00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:43.944
(video game guns blasting)

234
00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:46.146
What the water commissioner
said is true.

235
00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:48.215
We have water rights
to use 10.000 gallons

236
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:49.750
a month off our stream.

237
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.652
If we could cut back our
agricultural water use by 50%

238
00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:54.955
and show that our excess water
is making it down

239
00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.523
to the Denver Reservoir.

240
00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.125
then we'd have
the right to sell it.

241
00:10:58.225 --> 00:10:59.626
You really think so?

242
00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:01.194
I was a financial consultant

243
00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.330
before I was a weed farmer--
there's potential here.

244
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.265
But how do we
even prove the water

245
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.200
from our farms makes it
all the way to Denver?

246
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.902
-Raingutter regatta.
-What?

247
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.304
We made those little boats
in online COVID camp. remember?

248
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:14.007
Oh. yeah. I bet we could
float that down our stream.

249
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.411
We demonstrate
where the water goes.

250
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.813
and meanwhile.

251
00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:22.082
we start selling off
pieces of our water rights

252
00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:25.185
to subscribers that want it.

253
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.788
Boys. can you
build me a test boat?

254
00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:30.057
Sure.

255
00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:32.726
We're about to start
our very own...

256
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:33.894
streaming service.

257
00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:35.428
* Whores in this house *

258
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.564
* There's some whores
in this house *

259
00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:39.900
* There's some whores in this

260
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.502

261
00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:45.272

263
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.609
-* Woo. yeah *
-* Ah *

264
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.711
* Yeah. yeah *

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:54.147
* Yeah. yeah.

266
00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:56.016
* Wet-ass pussy.

267
00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.618
* And a mop
for this wet-ass pussy... *

268
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.754
TOLKIEN'S DAD:
The Credigree Weed
streaming service.

269
00:12:00.854 --> 00:12:02.122
We are currently in beta testing

270
00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.057
to see if our stream
makes it to Denver.

271
00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:05.358
but if it does. we are seeing

272
00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.061
if there are any
interested subscribers.

273
00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:11.899
-(overlapping shouting)
-* Give me everything you got
for this *

274
00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:14.902
* Wet-ass pussy. beat it up.
baby. catch a charge *

275
00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:17.871
* Extra large and extra hard.

276
00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:19.406
Come on.

277
00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.108
* Swipe your nose
like a credit card *

278
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.143
* Hop on top. I want to ride.
I do a kegel *

279
00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.345
* While it's inside. spit
in my mouth. look in my eyes *

280
00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.614
* This pussy is wet.

281
00:12:27.714 --> 00:12:29.416
* Tie me up like I'm surprised *

282
00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:31.084
* Let's roleplay.
I'll wear a disguise *

283
00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:33.453
* I want you to park
that big Mack truck *

284
00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:35.022
* Right in this little garage *

285
00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.990
* Make it cream.

286
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.592
* Out in public. make a scene.
I don't cook. I don't clean *

287
00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:41.895
-* But let me tell you

290
00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.268

00:12:57.577 --> 00:12:58.879
* Now get your boots

297
00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.513
* For this wet-ass pussy *

298
00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.849
* He bought a phone

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.216

00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:05.085
* Paid my tuition just to *

* I'm talkin' WAP. WAP. WAP.

307
00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.102
* Wet-ass pussy *

308
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:23.603
* Macaroni in a pot *

309
00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:25.105
* That's some wet-ass pussy *

310
00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:26.206
* Huh *

311
00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.141
* Whores in this house *

312
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.177
* There's some whores in this
house. there's some whores *

313
00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:32.846
* In this house. there's some
whores in this house *

314
00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:35.282
* There's some whores
in this house. there's some... *

315
00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.384
-Yeah! We did it! Yeah!
-We totally did it. dude.

316
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:40.387
As you can see. the water
from Credigree Farms flows

317
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.255
directly into
Denver's water supply.

318
00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.192
Well. in that case.
I suppose all your subscribers

319
00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.994
get to have more water
from the reservoir.

320
00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:48.495
Ah. Oh.

321
00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:50.830
You all make-a Pi Pi so happy.

322
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.300
Now. my water park
can have a-plenty a-water

323
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.068
to mix with all-a the pee.

324
00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.236
Of course.

325
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.504
you will have to prove

326
00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:59.239
that the flow of water
is constant.

327
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.074
We'll need a little boat
to come through

328
00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.775
to the reservoir every day.

329
00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.477
Every day?

330
00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:08.115
Boys. I'm gonna need you to make
a lot more boats for my stream.

331
00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:10.984
How do you feel about...
20 bucks a boat?

332
00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.186
20 bucks a boat? Hell yeah.

333
00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:15.488
We're gonna be rich. dude.

334
00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.126
Mom. Mom. I need to talk to you.

335
00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.527
Come on. sit down.

336
00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:22.629
Eric. if you're going
to yell at me again

337
00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:24.697
about our home. I really
don't have the strength.

338
00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.099
No. Mom.

339
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.701
I'm never gonna need
to yell at you ever again.

340
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.303
We're gonna
get out of here. Mom.

341
00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:32.339
What are you talking about?

342
00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.574
I've figured our way
out of this hot dog.

343
00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:36.309
I don't know if you've seen.
but there's a rich guy

344
00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:38.011
building a big house
across the street.

345
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:39.913
We can live in that house. Mom.

346
00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:41.314
We can have him take care of us.

347
00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.283
Eric. how would we do that?

348
00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.653
Because we are gonna get you...

349
00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:48.655
fake tits.

350
00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:49.522
What?

351
00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:50.890
Breast implants. Mom.

352
00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.325
That's what rich guys like.

353
00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:53.593
You remember
what Matt Damon said?

354
00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.495
Fortune favors the brave. Mom.

355
00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:57.464
When rich guys come up here
and get one look at you with

356
00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.166
your big. sweet tits. they're
gonna give us everything...

357
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:00.867
Eric. that's enough. okay?

358
00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:03.303
What do you mean it's enough?
I've-I've figured it all out.

359
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.172
Rich guys want a woman
with nice titties. Mom.

360
00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:06.573
-It's very...
-Okay.

361
00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:08.841
Eric. I'm not comfortable
talking about this.

362
00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:11.611
Well. I'm not comfortable
living in a fucking hot dog.

363
00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:15.182
We live here because I gave in
to you and quit my job.

364
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:17.050
What do you want from me. Eric?

365
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.152
I want you

366
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:22.355
to get breast implants. Mom.
(sniffles)

367
00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.724
So-so that rich guys like you.

368
00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:28.195
and we can go live
in a sweet house.

369
00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:29.729
Please. Mom.

370
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:33.133
I just want you
to get fake tits.

371
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:36.069
Eric. even if I wanted to.

372
00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:38.305
the fact is. we can't afford it.

373
00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:40.873
A surgery like that
is very expensive.

374
00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.109
Like. how expensive?

375
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.211
At least $10.000.

376
00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:47.247
$10.000?

377
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:48.881
Yes. Eric.

378
00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:51.618
We can't afford it?

379
00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:55.922
We can't afford it.

380
00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:03.463
Chief.

381
00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:05.698
-Chief. there's a big problem.
-What is it?

382
00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:09.002
We've got a code red
emergency call on 911.

383
00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:10.370
It's Karen.

384
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.173
Oh. not Karen again.
Jesus Christ.

385
00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.574
(phone beeps)

386
00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:16.576
Yes. Karen.
how can we help you this time?

387
00:16:16.676 --> 00:16:18.845
Okay. first of all.
I know what it means

388
00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:21.314
when you call me Karen.
so you can just knock it off.

389
00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:23.850
Secondly. secondly.
my neighbor's kid

390
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.285
is over here at my house.

391
00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:27.520
There's a kid trespassing
at your house?

392
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.589
No. my son invited him over

393
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.359
for lunch. and my wife is making
him hot dogs and tater tots.

394
00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.327
even though I said
I don't want him here.

395
00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.429
Well. then what harm
is he doing. Karen?

396
00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.465
His family farm is shady.

397
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.667
Did you know that they're
doing a streaming service?

398
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.335
I demand that you investigate.

399
00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:45.138
How did they manage
to even show that their water

400
00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:46.339
goes through to Denver?

401
00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:48.441
Hello? Are you listening to me?

402
00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:50.510
I want to talk to your manager.

403
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.546
I've already told you. Karen.
I don't have a manager.

404
00:16:56.383 --> 00:16:57.884
Thanks. Mrs. Marsh.

405
00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:59.152
Can you believe that?

406
00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.454
The cops aren't even
gonna do anything.

407
00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:03.090
Oh. well. at least
you tried. Karen.

408
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.058
-(chair scrapes floor)
-It just doesn't make sense.

409
00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:08.061
How is that traitor
able to prove his water

410
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:09.762
makes it down to Denver?

411
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:10.897
Well. um...

412
00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.632
maybe he got some
creative people

413
00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.667
to put something on his stream.

414
00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.770
Yeah. I'll bet you he did.

415
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.140
He's got to be paying
some expert or something.

416
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.975
Oh. if I could find that guy.
I'd pay him double.

417
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.347
Well. you know. at camp.
they had us build these...

418
00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:28.715
little boats. that. uh...

419
00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:30.550
They're kind of tough
to make. but...

420
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.454
I think that we could
make you something.

421
00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:37.757
And then we could float
the boats downstream

422
00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:39.826
from the farm
with little Tegridy sails

423
00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:42.929
on them to show people
where the water's coming from.

424
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:44.964
Could you guys build me
a test boat right away?

425
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:48.101
Oh. uh. yeah. we could probably
build you something. yeah.

426
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.037
I can't wait to see the look
on that traitor's face

427
00:17:51.138 --> 00:17:54.874
when he sees that we're
in the streaming business. too.

428
00:17:57.544 --> 00:17:59.579
Last night. I had a dream
that Ariana Grande

429
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:01.080
was trying to fuck
her own ass with a gun.

430
00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:03.683
but then she farted.
and blood shot out her dick.

431
00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:06.886
(laughs) Ariana Grande?
That's hilarious.

432
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:13.126
STAN:
Kyle.

433
00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:14.761
Kenny. You guys. get over here.

434
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:16.429
Sit down. you guys.
We need to talk.

435
00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:19.299
What's going on. dude?

436
00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.468
Check this out.

437
00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:22.769
Where'd you get that?

438
00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:24.604
Making stuff
for streaming services.

439
00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:26.072
Holy shit. Really?

440
00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:27.674
We made these
for my family's farm.

441
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.676
Then we took another deal
to make them for Stan's.

442
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.578
So then we went out
and offered boats to. like.

443
00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:32.979
three other farms.
and now they want stuff

444
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.314
for their streams. too.

445
00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:36.249
-So. you guys want to help us?
-I don't get it.

446
00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:37.817
You don't have to.
We don't. either.

447
00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:39.319
You just have to make boats.

448
00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:40.753
But we want to keep it
on the low

449
00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.455
because we don't want
other kids copying us.

450
00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:43.856
Are you guys
gonna have Cartman help?

451
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.525
No. He'll fuck it
all up somehow.

452
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.993
Okay. I'm in.

453
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:57.470
(sighs) Fuck.

454
00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:07.480
Faster. Work faster.

455
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.316
We need to be up and running.

456
00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:11.184
WATER COMMISSIONER:
Excuse me.

457
00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:13.486
Mr. Cussler. is it?

458
00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.322
Who are you?

459
00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:18.691
I'm the water commissioner.

460
00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:21.728
I just. uh. wanted to see
what you're up to up here.

461
00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.796
I'm not up to anything. Why?

462
00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.333
Well. you know. there's a lot
of streaming services

463
00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:29.068
starting up
in this town. and. uh...

464
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:32.272
word on the street is you might
be trying to outdo them all.

465
00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:35.375
They're all just
small time creeks.

466
00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:37.777
When it comes
to the Streaming Wars.

467
00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:41.013
I intend to be
the Amazon... River.

468
00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:44.384
Yeah. well. you see.
there's regulations.

469
00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:45.885
Mr. Cussler.

470
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.455
There's state rules
when it comes to streaming.

471
00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:50.523
And. uh. well.

472
00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:54.294
if you don't follow them.
bad things can happen.

473
00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:57.630
Is that right? Boys?

474
00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:03.169
I'm not some pissant
little farmer. Commissioner.

475
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.540
You want to threaten me.
I'll threaten you right back.

476
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.842
I didn't mean
to threaten you. sir.

477
00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:11.344
In fact.

478
00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:13.746
I think I can help you.

479
00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:16.783
(school bell rings)

480
00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:30.330
We've only got
20 minutes left. you guys.

481
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.564
We've got to work faster.

482
00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:33.132
I'm waiting on more
popsicle sticks.

483
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.034
Come on. Butters. you have to
speed up your station.

484
00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:38.738
I'm sucking down popsicles
as fast as I can. fellas.

485
00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:43.743
There you guys are.

486
00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:48.748
How come you're in
the home ec room during recess?

487
00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:50.683
Are those popsicle stick boats?

488
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:55.087
Oh. yeah. We're just making
some popsicle boats.

489
00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:57.557
We're gonna. you know. like.
race them. you know.

490
00:20:57.657 --> 00:21:00.360
You're gonna race
all those popsicle boats?

491
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.762
Yeah. just. you know.

492
00:21:02.862 --> 00:21:04.564
race them. see which one wins.

493
00:21:04.664 --> 00:21:06.333
Right-right. fellas?

494
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:09.969
Oh. That sounds
like a fun activity. Um...

495
00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:11.838
I was just gonna ask you guys.

496
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:14.541
do you know any way
to. like. raise money?

497
00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:17.777
What do you mean?

498
00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:19.178
We have no idea
what you're talking about.

499
00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:21.013
Okay. I just...

500
00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.683
I need to try and raise
some money because...

501
00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.452
my mom needs to have a surgery.

502
00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:28.588
and we can't afford it.

503
00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:32.825
Oh. Dude...

504
00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:34.961
How much does your mom
need for her surgery?

505
00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:38.264
About $10.000.
I'm sorry. you guys.

506
00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:41.468
Just go back to your boat races.
I'll talk to you later.

507
00:21:41.568 --> 00:21:43.603
Cartman. wait.

508
00:21:45.438 --> 00:21:47.374
You actually can help us.

509
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.375
Yeah.

510
00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:49.676
What do you mean?

511
00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.678
Look. dude. we're
actually making money

512
00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:52.779
for a streaming service.

513
00:21:52.879 --> 00:21:54.347
-Really?
-TOLKIEN: Yeah. come on.

514
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:56.315
You can help us. and we'll
cut you in on the profits.

515
00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:58.385
Oh. my God. what-what
streaming service is it?

516
00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.819
It's a bunch of different ones.

517
00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.021
Here. help me
cut out these masts.

518
00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:04.123
Okay. yeah. sure.

519
00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:06.626
And. Cartman. I'm sorry.

520
00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:08.695
Thanks. Kyle.

521
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:12.231
* *

522
00:22:23.643 --> 00:22:25.111
It's a green boat.

523
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:26.679
(crowd cheering)

524
00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:27.947
Anyone on the green boat

525
00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:29.649
streaming service
can have their allotment

526
00:22:29.749 --> 00:22:31.418
of water for the day.

527
00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:33.252
Oh. here comes the white boat.

528
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.654
(crowd cheering)

529
00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:35.922
Subscribers to

530
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:37.557
Kush Country Farms
Streaming service

531
00:22:37.657 --> 00:22:38.558
have their allotments.

532
00:22:38.658 --> 00:22:40.126
Escusi. Escusi.

533
00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:43.463
Pi Pi's been a-waiting
all day for his water ticket.

534
00:22:43.563 --> 00:22:45.498
My water park need water.

535
00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:47.033
You'll just have to be patient.

536
00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:48.968
There's a lot of different
streaming services now.

537
00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:52.004
Yes. there's a-too many
streaming services.

538
00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:54.273
There's a streaming service
for this-a.

539
00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:56.476
and streaming service
for that-a.

540
00:22:56.576 --> 00:22:59.412
Pi Pi can't find his stuff-a.

541
00:22:59.512 --> 00:23:00.913
Why can't-a Pi Pi just have

542
00:23:01.013 --> 00:23:03.850
a one streaming service
have-a everything?

543
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.052
Pi Pi got a streaming service
he like-a.

544
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:08.220
and then-a
Pi Pi's stuff not on it.

545
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.523
Pi Pi so confuse-a.

546
00:23:10.623 --> 00:23:13.359
(scanner beeping)

547
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.929
Yeah. yeah. we're getting
more supplies now.

548
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:18.364
You guys just
keep building boats.

549
00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:19.866
We'll be there fast as we can.

550
00:23:19.966 --> 00:23:21.934
Dude. I'm starting to think
we took on too much.

551
00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:24.003
-It's okay.
-It's not okay.

552
00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:26.005
We haven't even finished
Karen's boats yet.

553
00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:27.740
I do not want to piss Karen off.

554
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.842
Tolkien. I've told you.
don't worry about Karen.

555
00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:31.878
Everything's gonna be fine.

556
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.921
Hello. boys. That's quite
a haul you have there.

557
00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:45.492
My name is Mr. Cussler.

558
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.560
I bought some property up here.

559
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.361
I've been asking around.
and. uh...

560
00:23:49.462 --> 00:23:52.298
I believe you're the ones
responsible...

561
00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:53.733
for these?

562
00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.703
-Maybe.
-Fantastic little boats.

563
00:23:56.803 --> 00:23:58.270
I'm a big fan of your work.

564
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.807
I have a nice stream
going through my property.

565
00:24:00.907 --> 00:24:03.175
and I'd like you
to make something for me.

566
00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:06.913
-Oh. we're-we're pretty. uh...
-We're pretty loaded up. man.

567
00:24:07.013 --> 00:24:08.447
Oh. I'm sure you are.

568
00:24:08.548 --> 00:24:11.851
That's why I'd like to make you
an exclusive deal.

569
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.386
I want 10.000
of your little boats.

570
00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:17.524
and I'll pay you $15.000.

571
00:24:17.624 --> 00:24:19.659
BOTH:
$15.000?

572
00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:23.429
But I'm gonna need them
right away. Say three days?

573
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.832
I have... big plans.

574
00:24:25.932 --> 00:24:28.200
Dude. we can't make 10.000 boats
in three days.

575
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.902
We'll do it.

576
00:24:37.777 --> 00:24:40.613
Cartman. come on.
that looks like shit.

577
00:24:40.713 --> 00:24:42.048
Come on what. Kyle?

578
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:43.415
Look. I-I know we're making
a lot of these.

579
00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:46.118
but we still have to
make them look nice.

580
00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:48.220
-Does it really matter?
-Yes. it matters.

581
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.222
The streaming services
are paying for nice boats.

582
00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:51.991
BUTTERS:
(laughs) They don't
give a fuck. Kyle.

583
00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:54.260
They're gonna take
everything they can get.

584
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.995
Everyone knows.
at the end of the day.

585
00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:58.565
there's only gonna be. like.
three streaming services.

586
00:24:58.665 --> 00:25:00.567
so they. like. everyone
just wants to have their shit

587
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:03.035
on their stream
and get bought out. you know?

588
00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:05.471
And they don't give a fuck
how good anything is.

589
00:25:05.572 --> 00:25:08.207
And the people who made all the
deals. they don't give a fuck

590
00:25:08.307 --> 00:25:10.810
'cause they're all gonna get
fired anyway. you know?

591
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.344
And everyone working
at this streaming service

592
00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:14.346
is now working over
at that streaming service.

593
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:17.249
No one gives a shit about
what fucking goes on in it.

594
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.351
Butters. I-I think you've had
too many popsicles.

595
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.821
Yeah. I think maybe I've had
one too many popsicles.

596
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:22.889
(door opens)

597
00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:25.491
You guys. you guys. we did it.

598
00:25:25.592 --> 00:25:26.793
KENNY:
What'd we do?

599
00:25:26.893 --> 00:25:29.996
We just got an offer
for 10.000 boats.

600
00:25:30.096 --> 00:25:31.931
It's $15.000. you guys.

601
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:33.833
That's almost $3.000 each.

602
00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:36.335
-We're millionaires!
-Whoo-hoo!

603
00:25:36.435 --> 00:25:39.906
Hey. hey. aren't you guys
forgetting something?

604
00:25:40.006 --> 00:25:42.274
Cartman's mom's surgery?

605
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.910
Oh. right.

606
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.012
Well. what do you say. guys?

607
00:25:46.112 --> 00:25:47.780
With this money.
before we do anything.

608
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.215
we pay for Cartman's
mom's surgery.

609
00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:51.183
You definitely have
my share. Eric.

610
00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:51.984
Mine. too.

611
00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:54.453
I really...

612
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:57.189
really... don't fucking
deserve you guys.

613
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:59.025
Come on. let's get to work.

614
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:11.604
(water pipes creaking)

615
00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:17.443
NEWS REPORTER (over TV):
Just how bad could
the water situation get

616
00:26:17.543 --> 00:26:19.912
for Park County farmers
this summer?

617
00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:21.714
A new study says
this year's snowpack

618
00:26:21.814 --> 00:26:24.617
has almost completely
melted. and. once again.

619
00:26:24.717 --> 00:26:26.285
ManBearPig is to blame.

620
00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:28.721
That's right. Tom.
It appears ManBearPig

621
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:32.759
has done a lot more damage this
year than originally predicted.

622
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:34.560
As the spring thaws continue.

623
00:26:34.661 --> 00:26:36.328
we simply aren't seeing
that much water

624
00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.065
from way up
on the mountain peaks.

625
00:26:39.165 --> 00:26:41.233
If ManBearPig
is truly out there.

626
00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.435
then farmers might want
to start looking

627
00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:46.405
at the state
of that snowpack. Tom.

628
00:27:02.088 --> 00:27:04.323
* *

629
00:27:26.846 --> 00:27:29.081
* *

630
00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:54.774
Over here.

631
00:27:54.874 --> 00:27:57.109
Here!

632
00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:00.112
What is all this? What happened?

633
00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:02.749
The housing market up here...

634
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:04.150
it went crazy.

635
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.118
We've just been
selling properties

636
00:28:06.218 --> 00:28:08.120
without sleeping or eating.

637
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.589
This property here
was the last to get an offer.

638
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.524
The seller countered.
but we haven't heard back.

639
00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.126
and it's really
a buyer's market.

640
00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:15.361
Who's buying it all?

641
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:17.930
Some rich guy from the city.

642
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.531
(coughs)

643
00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.533
But we are currently
taking backup offers.

644
00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:23.535
if you'd like.
Do you have a broker?

645
00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:26.172
We are really the best in town.
My coworker Janice

646
00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:29.241
sold over 100 listings
in 72 hours.

647
00:28:31.077 --> 00:28:32.178
Look at this.

648
00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:34.646
They were right
about ManBearPig.

649
00:28:34.747 --> 00:28:36.916
There's not nearly
as much snow as last year.

650
00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:40.086
Yeah. There's a lot
you can do with this property.

651
00:28:40.186 --> 00:28:41.988
It has explosive views

652
00:28:42.088 --> 00:28:44.290
and a southern exposure
for those chilly winter nights.

653
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.258
You can't sell
all the land up here.

654
00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:47.994
Can't you see
they just want the water?

655
00:28:48.094 --> 00:28:51.663
That's probably why they asked
for the inspection contingency.

656
00:28:51.764 --> 00:28:53.532
We countered
with an extra 20 days

657
00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:56.268
until close of escrow.
(chuckles) We got them.

658
00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.104
There's no snow up here.

659
00:28:58.204 --> 00:28:59.906
There won't be enough water
for South Park.

660
00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:02.341
You...

661
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.343
You could have
a walkout basement here

662
00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:06.445
with room
for an outdoor kitchen.

663
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:11.183
Think of
the entertaining potential.

664
00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:13.452
Do you like to entertain?

665
00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:26.498
(yawns)

666
00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:31.470
(chickens clucking)

667
00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:45.551
(water rushing)

668
00:30:02.768 --> 00:30:05.304
"Cussler Industries"?

669
00:30:07.573 --> 00:30:09.775
Huh? Huh?

670
00:30:09.876 --> 00:30:12.111
Oh!

671
00:30:36.235 --> 00:30:38.470
* *

672
00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:46.512
My streaming service!

673
00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:53.785
* Happy surprise time *

674
00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:55.487
* To you *

675
00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:58.824
* Something's happened
that's cool... *

676
00:30:58.925 --> 00:31:00.426
What is this. Eric?

677
00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:03.529
* Just sit down right here *

678
00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:06.999
* Your son has done
something cool. *

679
00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:08.267
Are you ready. Mom?

680
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.903
(giggles) Yes.
What is it. sweetie?

681
00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.408
-Wait a minute. Eric.
what is this?
-(door opens)

682
00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:19.845
Okay. hello. Mrs. Cartman.
I'm Dr. Stevens.

683
00:31:19.946 --> 00:31:22.814
I understand you're interested
in breast augmentation?

684
00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:24.250
That's right. she is.

685
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.452
Well. there are a few options.

686
00:31:26.552 --> 00:31:28.620
We prefer
the saline implants now.

687
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.389
They-they can be put
either under

688
00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:32.124
the chest muscle or on top.

689
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.994
Did you have any idea what size
breasts you wanted to achieve?

690
00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:36.628
The largest size.

691
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:39.431
Eric. I've told you
a hundred times.

692
00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:41.567
I'm not getting a boob job.

693
00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:45.404
Uh. I'm a bit confused here.
Mrs. Cartman.

694
00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:48.474
Your procedure has already been
completely paid for.

695
00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:51.210
-What?
-Surprise!

696
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.479
I raised all the money. Mom.
It's done.

697
00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:57.349
No. Eric. I said
I don't want breast implants.

698
00:31:57.449 --> 00:31:58.850
You said we couldn't afford it.

699
00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:00.452
I went out.
and I worked every day.

700
00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:02.388
and I got you the money
for new tits. Mom.

701
00:32:02.488 --> 00:32:04.957
I'm fine with my body
the way it is.

702
00:32:05.057 --> 00:32:07.826
You are. but rich guys aren't.
Am I right. Doctor?

703
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.895
Okay. uh. Mrs. Cartman.

704
00:32:09.996 --> 00:32:12.531
if you'd like to just go back
up to the front office.

705
00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:14.266
they can refund all the money.

706
00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:18.037
No! No. Doctor. please.
I live in a hot dog!

707
00:32:18.137 --> 00:32:20.306
Because he made me quit my job.

708
00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:21.773
and I promised myself

709
00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.343
I wouldn't give in
to him ever again.

710
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:27.513
Get fake tits or else
I'll call the police. Mom.

711
00:32:27.613 --> 00:32:30.082
Do what you want. Eric.
I am done with this.

712
00:32:30.182 --> 00:32:31.483
Fine. then I'll run away.

713
00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:33.419
You'll just have
to run away. then.

714
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.720
I'll go live with Grandma.

715
00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.156
I'm sure Grandma
would love that.

716
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.792
I've given in to you
too many times. Eric.

717
00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:42.594
It stops now.

718
00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:45.564
You're not gonna give in. huh?
We'll just see about that.

719
00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:49.301
Doctor. keep those tits on ice.

720
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.971
(door opens)

721
00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:54.606
(door closes)

722
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.914
What is that?

723
00:33:03.015 --> 00:33:06.585
It's... it's a little boat.

724
00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:09.155
Stan. are you making stuff

725
00:33:09.255 --> 00:33:11.423
for other streaming services?

726
00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:15.127
Stanley? We had a deal.

727
00:33:15.227 --> 00:33:18.330
Are you making stuff for other
streaming services. yes or no?

728
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:21.300
Yes. This guy paid us
a shitload of money.

729
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.968
I paid you a shitload of money.

730
00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:24.803
Yeah. we make them
for whoever pays us.

731
00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:26.738
We make stuff
for Credigree. too.

732
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.307
For Credigree?

733
00:33:28.407 --> 00:33:30.242
They're the enemy. Stan.

734
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:31.710
You live here.

735
00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.046
You're exclusive
to Tegridy Weed.

736
00:33:34.146 --> 00:33:36.482
(scoffs) Everyone is fighting
and trying to get rich.

737
00:33:36.582 --> 00:33:38.184
and we're just in the middle
doing our thing.

738
00:33:38.284 --> 00:33:40.419
Doing your thing. Wow.

739
00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:42.121
You're a fucking dick.

740
00:33:42.221 --> 00:33:43.989
How much money's enough. Stan?

741
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.291
Cock-sucking cunt.

742
00:33:45.391 --> 00:33:47.426
-What is going on?
-Oh. nothing.

743
00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:49.695
Your son and his friends
just made exclusive deals

744
00:33:49.795 --> 00:33:51.797
for multiple streaming services.

745
00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:52.931
Ugh.

746
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.500
Oh. but I guess
that's just Karen

747
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.268
being Karen again. huh?

748
00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.470
Yeah. screw whatever
Karen thinks.

749
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.973
Maybe it's bad for business.
but fuck Karen.

750
00:34:02.074 --> 00:34:03.742
Okay. I'm sorry.

751
00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:06.478
We're going to march right over
to where this guy lives.

752
00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:08.480
and tell him that
you can't possibly take on

753
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.582
another streaming service
without sacrificing

754
00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:13.819
-the quality of your product.
-Rats.

755
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:21.093
(clears throat)

756
00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:33.472
Well. Mom. I guess
I'll be leaving now.

757
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:35.574
Oh. really? Where are you going?

758
00:34:35.674 --> 00:34:37.309
I can't do this anymore. Mom.

759
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.845
If you won't listen to me. then
I really don't have a choice.

760
00:34:39.945 --> 00:34:42.381
Well. I'm very sorry
to hear that. Eric.

761
00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:44.816
I hope you take
good care of yourself.

762
00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.986
Okay. well. I guess I'll just
ask you one more time

763
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:49.821
if you would please
get fake tits. I know...

764
00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.558
I'm not getting
breast implants. Eric.

765
00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:54.160
Okay. that's fine.

766
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.561
So. you're running away?

767
00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:57.329
Oh. I'm not running away. Mom.

768
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:58.997
No. that would be
the easy way out.

769
00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.799
You remember when
I told you how easy

770
00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:02.601
breast enhancement would be.

771
00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:04.370
and you said. "If it's so easy.
why don't you do it?"

772
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.172
Well. I'm taking
your advice. Mom.

773
00:35:06.272 --> 00:35:09.074
If you won't get fake breasts.
then I will.

774
00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:11.577
-What?
-I've already paid the clinic.

775
00:35:11.677 --> 00:35:13.379
and I'll just tell them that
the implants were for me.

776
00:35:13.479 --> 00:35:14.880
You know it's 2022. right?

777
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.782
You know they do surgeries
like this to kids now?

778
00:35:16.882 --> 00:35:19.951
Guess I'll just go
and get fake tits. Mom.

779
00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:23.555
Well. Eric. I guess
that's just your choice.

780
00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:26.158
Mom. I'm serious. It's 2022.

781
00:35:26.258 --> 00:35:28.194
They do these kinds
of surgeries to kids now.

782
00:35:28.294 --> 00:35:29.628
Yes. I know.

783
00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:31.530
Okay. well. then
I'm gonna go to the doctor.

784
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:32.998
and I'm gonna go get
breast implants.

785
00:35:33.098 --> 00:35:34.633
Okay.

786
00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.269
Okay. Mom.
I'm going out the door.

787
00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:39.471
Okay. sweetie. be safe.

788
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:40.872
Gonna go get fake tits now.

789
00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.674
If that's what you want. Eric.

790
00:35:42.774 --> 00:35:44.610
It's not what I want. it's what
you're making me do. Mom.

791
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.546
Okay. honey. well. I love you.

792
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:52.718
-Okay. well. I'll see you.
-Bye. honey.

793
00:35:56.522 --> 00:35:57.923
Gonna go get breast implants.

794
00:35:58.023 --> 00:36:01.227
I'll come pick you up
when you're done.

795
00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:03.729
Cool.

796
00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:19.978
Come on.

797
00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:26.852
Yes?

798
00:36:26.952 --> 00:36:29.421
Hello. we'd like to speak
with Mr. Cussler. please.

799
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:30.789
For what?

800
00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:33.124
Well. I want to let him know
that my son here

801
00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:36.395
made a streaming deal
that he had no business making.

802
00:36:36.495 --> 00:36:37.563
Didn't you. Stan?

803
00:36:37.663 --> 00:36:39.097
No. technically. no.

804
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.399
Technically what?

805
00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:43.101
I'm afraid
Mr. Cussler can't see you.

806
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.836
Oh. really? Okay. well.

807
00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:47.906
you go and tell him
that it's Karen Marsh. okay?

808
00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:50.041
And that I will talk
to him right now.

809
00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.078
He can't talk to you
because he's dead.

810
00:36:53.178 --> 00:36:54.680
What?

811
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.416
Mr. Cussler's body was found
several hours ago.

812
00:36:57.516 --> 00:36:59.585
He was... attacked

813
00:36:59.685 --> 00:37:01.587
by ManBearPig.

814
00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:06.492
(indistinct radio chatter)

815
00:37:06.592 --> 00:37:07.893
Everyone keep this area clear.

816
00:37:07.993 --> 00:37:09.561
I need casts of the footprints.

817
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:12.598
Keep your radios down. We don't
want the press showing up.

818
00:37:12.698 --> 00:37:14.165
What's going on here?

819
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:15.667
Aw. shit. it's Karen.

820
00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:17.102
(officers grumbling)

821
00:37:17.202 --> 00:37:19.638
Hey. look. my son
was in business with this guy.

822
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:21.707
You really think
he was killed by ManBearPig?

823
00:37:21.807 --> 00:37:23.141
Take a look for yourself.

824
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:26.011
Something tore him apart
and shit in his face.

825
00:37:26.111 --> 00:37:27.879
Workers found him
late this morning.

826
00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:29.781
The footprints
are those of a pig.

827
00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:31.182
but the claw marks
are those of a bear.

828
00:37:31.283 --> 00:37:33.652
and the excrement.
clearly that of a man.

829
00:37:35.053 --> 00:37:37.589
Why would ManBearPig
single him out?

830
00:37:37.689 --> 00:37:38.957
Apparently. this Cussler guy

831
00:37:39.057 --> 00:37:40.959
was taking advantage
of the water supply.

832
00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:43.362
ManBearPig must've gotten
some kind of vengeance

833
00:37:43.462 --> 00:37:45.196
for the rich guy's greed.

834
00:37:46.732 --> 00:37:48.367
Oh. no.

835
00:37:48.467 --> 00:37:50.802
Karen? What is it?

836
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.271
Karen?

837
00:37:53.372 --> 00:37:54.706
It's just that...

838
00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:57.709
if ManBearPig was getting
vengeance on Cussler.

839
00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.946
would he also want
to come after my son?

840
00:38:12.458 --> 00:38:13.492
(knock on door)

841
00:38:13.592 --> 00:38:15.961
Ah. yes. Come on-a in.

842
00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:18.129
It's a-open.

843
00:38:19.365 --> 00:38:21.667
Hello. Pi Pi.
Do you have a minute?

844
00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:24.870
Oh. my good friend
from-a Credigree Farm-a.

845
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.173
So nice a-you to visit.
Mwah. Mwah.

846
00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:31.777
Look. Everything going good
for-a Pi Pi water park.

847
00:38:31.877 --> 00:38:34.413
Everyone having fun.

848
00:38:34.513 --> 00:38:37.616
Yes. that's what I came
to talk to you about.

849
00:38:37.716 --> 00:38:39.385
Pi Pi. I'm sorry. but...

850
00:38:39.485 --> 00:38:41.887
I'm going to have to cancel
my streaming service.

851
00:38:41.987 --> 00:38:44.322
What? Cancel-a Pi Pi?

852
00:38:44.423 --> 00:38:46.825
The drought is worse
than everyone thought.

853
00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:49.094
ManBearPig did a lot
of damage this year and...

854
00:38:49.194 --> 00:38:51.430
I don't have enough water
for my crops.

855
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.199
Oh. that's too bad.

856
00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:57.736
It's too bad 'cause
now you fucked. a-huh?

857
00:38:57.836 --> 00:39:00.606
I need my water rights back.

858
00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:02.441
or else my farm won't survive.

859
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:04.910
Oh. you make-a Pi Pi cry.

860
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.845
What-a you expect-a. huh?

861
00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:09.080
It's a drought everywhere.

862
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.717
Why you think I buy your water?

863
00:39:11.817 --> 00:39:14.853
You can-a suck Pi Pi dick. huh?

864
00:39:14.953 --> 00:39:16.321
Hey. you son of a bitch.

865
00:39:16.422 --> 00:39:18.156
You knew what you were doing
the whole time.

866
00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:19.958
You think I'm just gonna
sit here and take it?

867
00:39:20.058 --> 00:39:21.292
I'll call
the water commissioner.

868
00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:24.129
Oh. no. No. you-you don't
have to call him.

869
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:25.831
He's right here.

870
00:39:28.567 --> 00:39:30.502
Afternoon. pal.

871
00:39:30.602 --> 00:39:33.304
How's the drought treating you?

872
00:39:33.405 --> 00:39:35.607
So. the water commissioner
was working

873
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:37.242
for you the whole time.

874
00:39:37.342 --> 00:39:39.511
Well. I don't have a problem
kicking both of your asses.

875
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:44.416
Oh. I'd be a little more worried
about the other guy.

876
00:39:47.686 --> 00:39:49.588
(roaring)

877
00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:50.922
(screeching)

878
00:39:51.022 --> 00:39:53.825
ManBearPig.
He's working for you. too?

879
00:39:53.925 --> 00:39:56.928
Everybody wants to get
in the streaming business.

880
00:39:57.028 --> 00:39:58.430
You're the one who bought
all the properties

881
00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.865
on the mountaintop.

882
00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:01.399
You just have it all
figured out. don't you?

883
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.103
Yeah. looks like-a Pi Pi
has it all pretty figured out.

884
00:40:05.203 --> 00:40:08.106
Goddamn it. I'm not gonna
let you... (screams)

885
00:40:12.778 --> 00:40:15.046
(screams)

886
00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:21.520
(choking)

887
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.722
I'm sorry. Pi Pi can't hear you.

888
00:40:26.558 --> 00:40:27.793
(screaming)

889
00:40:35.834 --> 00:40:38.003
(screaming)

890
00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:54.152
How is he?

891
00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:58.123
I believe he's
coming to. Doctor.

892
00:40:58.223 --> 00:41:00.258
(groaning)

893
00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:04.429
Hello. Eric. Just want to let
you know everything went fine.

894
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.131
We're gonna let
the anesthesia wear off

895
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:08.166
a little more. and then
we can let you go home.

896
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:09.668
(stammers)

897
00:41:09.768 --> 00:41:11.970
Okay. Um. cool.

898
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.605
CARTMAN'S MOM:
Well. you did it. Eric.

899
00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:15.874
I hope you're happier now.

900
00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:18.043
They all said
you were very insistent.

901
00:41:18.143 --> 00:41:20.078
That you said you'd
cancel them if they didn't

902
00:41:20.178 --> 00:41:21.780
put breast implants
in one of us.

903
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.882
I-I...

904
00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:25.984
I-I have fake tits?

905
00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:29.955
CARTMAN'S MOM:
They said that tube

906
00:41:30.055 --> 00:41:32.290
is for draining blood
while the swelling goes down.

907
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.261
Your breasts are swollen now
as a reaction to the implants.

908
00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:39.531
Okay. well. now that you see
how serious I was.

909
00:41:39.631 --> 00:41:41.132
what're you gonna do now?

910
00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:44.202
I'm gonna go down and
get some grocery shopping done.

911
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.237
Mom?

912
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.907
I will go to school like this.

913
00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:52.077
You're gonna have to give in
at some point.

914
00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:54.445
Mom?

915
00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:57.415
(school bell rings)

916
00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:59.350
Well. have you guys seen
Butters or Cartman?

917
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.319
-What the hell is going on?
-I don't know. but we have

918
00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:03.054
a lot of boats to make.
and recess is almost over.

919
00:42:03.154 --> 00:42:04.355
You guys. You guys.

920
00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:06.257
There you are.
What's wrong dude?

921
00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:10.095
Um. we need to stop making stuff
for streaming services.

922
00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:11.262
What're you talking about?

923
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.064
It's all getting really weird.

924
00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:15.934
The guy we made the deal with?
He was killed.

925
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:17.235
He was killed?

926
00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:19.671
I think we got greedy.
I got greedy.

927
00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:21.840
We should've never gotten
involved in the streaming wars.

928
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.709
They've upset
the balance of nature.

929
00:42:23.809 --> 00:42:24.743
Hey. whoa. whoa. Stan.

930
00:42:24.843 --> 00:42:26.444
We weren't greedy. okay?

931
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.046
We made the money
for a good reason.

932
00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:29.347
Yeah. dude. Don't forget.

933
00:42:29.447 --> 00:42:31.049
everything we did
was for a good cause.

934
00:42:31.149 --> 00:42:32.050
CARTMAN:
You guys.

935
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.752
You guys. something

936
00:42:33.852 --> 00:42:36.354
is seriously wrong with my mom.

937
00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:38.624
She's acting crazy.

938
00:42:38.724 --> 00:42:41.559
Are any of your parents
acting weird at all?

939
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.963
Hey. fellas. are we making more
boats for the-- Whoa. hello!

940
00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:47.065
Jesus. what happened
to you. Eric?

941
00:42:47.165 --> 00:42:49.167
Okay. okay. fine. I was hoping

942
00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.802
everyone would just be cool.

943
00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:53.605
but I guess we need to talk
about the elephants in the room.

944
00:42:53.705 --> 00:42:55.373
This was not a choice.

945
00:42:55.473 --> 00:42:57.142
You guys. I...

946
00:42:57.242 --> 00:43:00.145
I live in a hot dog. okay?

947
00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:02.247
And all I want
is to have a real home.

948
00:43:02.347 --> 00:43:04.616
and a room that is mine
to sleep in at night.

949
00:43:04.716 --> 00:43:06.051
To-- Is something funny. Clyde?

950
00:43:06.151 --> 00:43:08.119
(stifled laughter)

951
00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:09.855
Yeah. it's real funny.

952
00:43:09.955 --> 00:43:11.389
If I were you guys.
I'd be super pissed

953
00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:13.158
at my mom because you
worked hard for this money.

954
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:14.960
All right. Cartman.
stop fucking around.

955
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.327
Obviously. those aren't real.

956
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:19.030
I didn't say they're real.
They're not real.

957
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.932
They're silicone implants
surgically inserted

958
00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:22.367
under the chest muscle.

959
00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:23.935
Nobody believes
you actually got fake tits.

960
00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:25.436
These are real fake tits.

961
00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:28.206
Kenny. feel them.
Go on. feel them.

962
00:43:33.712 --> 00:43:35.113
Those are fucking real. dude.

963
00:43:35.213 --> 00:43:36.614
-What?
-Thank you. Kenny.

964
00:43:36.715 --> 00:43:38.483
Now. if we can all get our minds
off fucking boobs

965
00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:40.819
for a second.
something's happened to my mom.

966
00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:42.988
TOLKIEN:
Mom? Mom. what's wrong?

967
00:43:43.088 --> 00:43:46.157
Mom. slow down.
I can't understand you.

968
00:43:47.726 --> 00:43:49.527
What do you mean Dad is missing?

969
00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:51.663
See?

970
00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:58.670
I want to congratulate you.
Pi Pi.

971
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.172
It appears you've won
the streaming wars.

972
00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:04.976
And I want to thank-a you
for your service.

973
00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:07.178
It's been-a nice
working with you.

974
00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:10.048
(chuckles) You think it's over?

975
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:11.717
You're gonna need me
more than ever.

976
00:44:11.817 --> 00:44:15.253
Oh. but. uh. but I have-a
everything I need now.

977
00:44:15.353 --> 00:44:17.488
Water?

978
00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.624
You silly little guy.

979
00:44:19.725 --> 00:44:22.427
You really think you own
all the water now?

980
00:44:22.527 --> 00:44:25.163
You know who actually
owns the water?

981
00:44:25.263 --> 00:44:27.065
The State of Colorado.

982
00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:28.800
Every drop that rains
from the sky.

983
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.636
Your little water rights
won't mean anything when Arizona

984
00:44:31.737 --> 00:44:34.773
comes knocking. when Kansas
wants all their water.

985
00:44:34.873 --> 00:44:37.342
Oh. no. You make-a Pi Pi worry.

986
00:44:37.442 --> 00:44:40.912
You're gonna need me
for a long time. buddy.

987
00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:43.548
You know who
really own the water?

988
00:44:43.648 --> 00:44:44.883
Nobody.

989
00:44:44.983 --> 00:44:46.151
Now. the people a Denver.

990
00:44:46.251 --> 00:44:48.153
they think they have-a
plenty of water.

991
00:44:48.253 --> 00:44:50.555
so they gonna go and use it all.

992
00:44:50.655 --> 00:44:53.391
And when all
the water is-a gone.

993
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:57.462
there's only one thing left
for people to use.

994
00:44:57.562 --> 00:45:01.632
The one thing that-a Pi Pi have
more than everybody. huh?

995
00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:07.705
No. no. no. It's good.
It's completely safe.

996
00:45:07.806 --> 00:45:09.140
Just a little salty. eh?

997
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.177
You're planning on selling piss?

998
00:45:12.277 --> 00:45:14.245
It's-a. it's-a destiny.

999
00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:16.381
All the fresh water go bye-bye.

1000
00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:19.417
Everybody gonna have to wash
their clothes in pee.

1001
00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:22.120
Brush their teeth in pee. no?

1002
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.589
And who has the most pee

1003
00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:26.657
in all the land-a?

1004
00:45:26.758 --> 00:45:29.227
Only a psychopath
would speed up climate change

1005
00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:30.862
for his own profit.

1006
00:45:30.962 --> 00:45:34.199
Yeah. well. you see. ManBearPig.

1007
00:45:34.299 --> 00:45:38.136
eventually.
he gonna kill everybody.

1008
00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:41.339
He just gonna kill you first.

1009
00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.542

continues screaming)

getting used *

using me... *

1020

1021
00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:40.231

1022
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:46.771
* Until you use me up *

1025
00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:00.251
* And he talked to me *

1026
00:47:01.853 --> 00:47:03.488
* Uh-huh *

1027
00:47:03.588 --> 00:47:06.157
