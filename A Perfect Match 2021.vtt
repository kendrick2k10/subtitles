00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.367
On a percentage scale.

185
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.433
Ms. Lee:
Right.

186
00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:30.633
I had my assistant
download the beta version.

187
00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:33.533
Your questionnaire
is much more lengthy

188
00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.200
than the average
dating app.

189
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.033
And that's just step one.

190
00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:38.867
After our users complete
the questionnaire.

191
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.700
our behaviour analyst
team contacts them

192
00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:42.033
for a video interview.

193
00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:43.900
Most other dating apps
on the market

194
00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:46.400
have ten or so
key questions.

195
00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:47.900
How do you know people
will stick around

196
00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:51.400
to complete their profile in
an age when everyone's so busy?

197
00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:54.567
People who really want
to find love make the time.

198
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.567
At least that's what
our research has shown.

199
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.133
Our test users. which makes
up just over 4.000 profiles.

200
00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:01.633
have shown us great
results so far.

201
00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:02.900
Mhm.

202
00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:05.300
We have a pitch sheet with
all the nitty gritty details.

203
00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:06.467
I'll email that to you.

204
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.800
Great.

205
00:08:07.934 --> 00:08:08.967
So what else do
I need to know

206
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.066
about the profile
building process?

207
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.233
Um. our research team
also collects any other data

208
00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:16.934
they can find online
about each user.

209
00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:19.433
Zoe:
We want to be as
comprehensive as possible

210
00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:21.934
to make sure that we get
the most accurate match.

211
00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:23.100
What kind of info?

212
00:08:23.233 --> 00:08:24.934
Mostly social media.

213
00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:27.767
We want to see how the
user presents themselves.

214
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.100
and how they act candidly.

215
00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:32.600
So you're building profiles
and you're matching people

216
00:08:32.734 --> 00:08:34.600
based on compatible
personalities.

217
00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:35.600
Correct.
-Yeah.

218
00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:36.934
Okay.

219
00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:39.934
So hypothetically speaking.
user completes their profile.

220
00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:42.934
you analyze their info.
then what?

221
00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:45.767
Then we can break down
their personality type.

222
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.266
How many personality
types are there?

223
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.934
Twenty-six.

224
00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:50.800
We've modelled our
system loosely

225
00:08:50.934 --> 00:08:52.633
around other
personality tests.

226
00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:54.467
but we ask our
own questions.

227
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.734
It's pretty standard.

228
00:08:56.934 --> 00:08:58.467
But what about chemistry?

229
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.367
How can you predict that
certain je-ne-sais-quoi?

230
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.367
Chemistry prediction is
actually our specialty.

231
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.367
It's what separates us
from other dating apps.

232
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.367
We would never match people
who are exactly alike.

233
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.567
there'd be no spark.

234
00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:12.800
I'll be honest.

235
00:09:12.934 --> 00:09:15.133
your app sounds intriguing.

236
00:09:15.266 --> 00:09:20.467
(suspenseful music)

237
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.066
What kind of pizza
do you like?

238
00:09:23.633 --> 00:09:25.166
What's that got to
do with anything?

239
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.000
Jillian:
The questions
may seem random

240
00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.433
but they're very telling.

241
00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:31.533
Anchovies and feta.

242
00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:33.166
Zoe:
And how would you
describe yourself?

243
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.500
Logical or emotional?

244
00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:35.500
Logical.

245
00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:36.834
You're on vacation.

246
00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:39.166
Do you have a rough
list of ideas

247
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.266
or do you have every
detail planned?

248
00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:44.400
Depends on the trip.

249
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:46.667
Zoe:
You look forward to
coming into work most days.

250
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.000
true or false?

251
00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:49.166
True.

252
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.333
Zoe:
You believe in fate
or coincidence?

253
00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:52.834
Coincidence. no question.

254
00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.100
Me too.

255
00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:55.867
Jillian:
Okay. so she's most
likely a Class D.

256
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.867
but we'd have to do a litte
bit more digging to make s.

257
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.867
Ms. Lee:
What does that mean.
class D?

258
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.033
Zoe:
You spend the bulk of
your time at work.

259
00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.200
but you're not afraid
to let your hair down.

260
00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.200
You're all business
from nine to seven.

261
00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:07.200
but when you leave.

262
00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:09.867
you're actually
pretty easy going.

263
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.033
Yes. but I-

264
00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:12.367
Zoe:
You like to spend
your free time

265
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.200
watching classical
romance movies.

266
00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:18.300
going bowling or fly fishing.
depending on the weather.

267
00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:22.300
Like I said earlier.

268
00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:26.033
part of our profiles are
built by asking questions.

269
00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.133
and the other part is
through online research.

270
00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:34.567
(playful music)

271
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.233
Zoe:
We have several
suitable candidates.

272
00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:38.667
should you be interested
in setting up a profile.

273
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.000
It's impressive. indeed.

274
00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:44.333
I'll tell you what.

275
00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.567
If you can prove to me that
at least one of your couples

276
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.500
is as successful
offscreen as it is on.

277
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.500
I'll invest.

278
00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:56.567
Let's say 90%
compatibility or higher.

279
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.834
Sound fair?

280
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.133
I'll give you thirty days.

281
00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:01.900
I leave for Shanghai
next month.

282
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.433
Um. how do we prove that a
relationship is successful?

283
00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.934
Bring the happy couple
in for a quick meeting.

284
00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:12.934
That's all you need to
prove the app works?

285
00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:16.934
Ms. Jones. love is
like a good movie:

286
00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:18.367
I know it when I see it.

287
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.100
See you in thirty days.

288
00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:25.266
(playful music)

289
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.867
Leo:
What if we hired a
couple actors. huh?

290
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.767
What. you got a better idea?

291
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.433
Jillian:
(scoffs) To pretend
they're in love?

292
00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.433
Ms. Lee's a smart woman.

293
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:34.767
she'll see right
through that.

294
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.467
Leo:
Yeah. you're right.
you're right.

295
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.400
What if we hired a couple
that's already in love?

296
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.967
I mean. if we try to
track an external user.

297
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.633
they'll just tell us
what we want to hear.

298
00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:47.800
Zoe:
Exactly.

299
00:11:47.934 --> 00:11:50.633
If we want to accurately
track relationship progress.

300
00:11:50.767 --> 00:11:52.066
we need an honest report.

301
00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:55.800
What did you have
in mind. exactly?

302
00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:57.633
I think we should all
sign up for an account.

303
00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:59.800
See who gets the
highest match.

304
00:11:59.934 --> 00:12:02.867
Um. aren't there only
like a few thousand profiles

305
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.200
to match with from
our test users?

306
00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:07.867
I mean. how is one of us
supposed to match with someone

307
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.467
at 90% or more?

308
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.500
Zoe:
Four thousand. two hundredd
twenty-two profiles. actua.

309
00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:16.333
And I know it's not a lot.
but I'm up for the challenge.

310
00:12:16.467 --> 00:12:18.667
Look. we all know
this app works.

311
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.433
Now it's time for
us to prove it.

312
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.667
Ah. this is so exciting.

314
00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:26.500
Okay. if anyone is
in a relationship

315
00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:29.667
or you don't want to partake.
I completely understand.

If you'll excuse me.

320
00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:42.000

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:49.867
I matched with someone
last night at 98%.

363
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.533
Leo:
Yeah. we saw the numbers
first thing this morning.

364
00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:54.533
and wow.

365
00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:56.367
Zoe:
I'm surprised as anyone.

366
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.867
I mean. did you
see his profile?

367
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.800
Why. is he
not your type?

368
00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:04.967
(playful music)

369
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.467
So I am so happy.

370
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.800
I mean. this is great
for the company.

371
00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.400
but it's great
for you too.

372
00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:13.734
Did anyone else match?

373
00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:18.333
The only other high match
we got was Leo at 86%.

374
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.900
Leo:
All bets are
on you. boss.

375
00:16:22.033 --> 00:16:23.233
No pressure.
am I right?

376
00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:24.500
(laughs)

377
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.333
(Zoe sighs)

378
00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:38.533
Hey. do you have a sec?

379
00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:40.867
Always.

380
00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:46.533
You were right. haven't
been on a date in a while.

381
00:16:47.734 --> 00:16:48.600
(scoffs) Come. come.

382
00:16:48.734 --> 00:16:49.867
Let's discuss.

383
00:16:52.567 --> 00:16:54.100
Okay. what do I wear?

384
00:16:54.233 --> 00:16:55.934
Oh. okay.

385
00:16:56.066 --> 00:17:00.166
Has he messaged you saying
what he's going to wear?

386
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.667
Green shirt and khakis.

387
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.834
Ooh. semi-casual. okay.

388
00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:04.000
And where are you meeting?

389
00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:05.333
Some cafe he recommended.

390
00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:06.600
Okay. okay.

391
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:10.700
So you want something fabulous.
but not too over the top.

392
00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:14.734
(gasps) Oh. you should wear
that blue dress that you have.

393
00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:18.734
No. it's-it's got like
polka dots and it's like.

394
00:17:19.433 --> 00:17:20.300
(gasps) Yes!

395
00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:21.800
I love that dress.

396
00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:23.066
(sighs) Thank you!

397
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.233
Okay.

398
00:17:33.266 --> 00:17:34.567
Are you nervous?

399
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.467
I know it sounds silly.
but yeah. a little.

400
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.967
Why?

401
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.400
Because of what Leo said?

402
00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:45.500
Ugh. Leo has no filter.

403
00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.667
What is our number one
rule at DigiLove?

404
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.667
One step at a time.

405
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.834
One step at a time.

406
00:17:49.967 --> 00:17:53.166
Just go for coffee
and see how it goes.

407
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.834
You're right.

408
00:17:54.967 --> 00:17:56.166
You're so right.

409
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.100
This is why you're
my best friend.

410
00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:02.734
Leo:
Hey boss. can I take
off early today?

411
00:18:02.867 --> 00:18:04.500
I've been having
stomach troubles.

412
00:18:06.033 --> 00:18:07.734
if you know what I mean.

413
00:18:07.867 --> 00:18:09.734
Zoe:
Sure. of course. Leo.

414
00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:11.166
Thank you so much.

415
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.500
All right.

416
00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:13.767
Honestly. I'm due.

417
00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:19.867
(playful music)

418
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.633
(sighs) No filter.

419
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.200
(playful music)

420
00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.033
You got this.

421
00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.467
No pressure.

422
00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:40.967
No pressure at all.

423
00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:44.633
One step at a time.

424
00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:53.233
(playful music)

425
00:18:53.367 --> 00:19:01.133
♪

426
00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.967
(both laugh)

427
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.667
Uh. so you're Zoe.

428
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.100
And you're you.

429
00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:17.233
Uh. I thought your
name was Beckett.

430
00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:18.834
That's my last name.

431
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.066
Oliver Beckett.

432
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.667
And Zoe?

433
00:19:24.066 --> 00:19:25.100
Williams.

434
00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:26.367
Zoe Williams.

435
00:19:29.734 --> 00:19:31.600
Well. just when I thought the
world couldn't get any smaller.

436
00:19:31.734 --> 00:19:33.100
Oh. this is good.

437
00:19:33.233 --> 00:19:36.100
It means I can finally
apologize and make it up to you.

438
00:19:36.233 --> 00:19:39.266
since you wouldn't accept my
plant offering the other day.

439
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.433
Because you called
me a workaholic.

440
00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:42.433
Oh. I did?

441
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:43.867
Doesn't sound like me.

442
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.266
All right. well now I
can. uh. get you a coffee

443
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.600
and then my
karma is reset.

444
00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:52.700
Well. I can't say no to that.
now can I?

445
00:19:57.767 --> 00:19:59.133
Can I get a latte please?

446
00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:00.734
Oh. and an almond croissant.

447
00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:06.633
Oh. and I will get. uh.

448
00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:10.734
I'll get. uh. you know what.
surprise me.

449
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.633
Surprise you?

450
00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:18.800
Yeah. I like
trying new things.

451
00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:22.133
And what happens when you
don't like what he brings you?

452
00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:24.066
I-I guess I'll know
for next time.

453
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.233
But I'm not picky.

454
00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:28.467
You're very brave.

455
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.667
(Oliver laughs)

456
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.333
So how was your meeting in
Ms. Lee's office the other day?

457
00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:36.500
It went really
well. actually.

458
00:20:36.633 --> 00:20:38.834
despite the unusable
pitch sheets.

459
00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.500
(inhales sharply) Right.

460
00:20:40.633 --> 00:20:42.500
Again. sorry.

461
00:20:42.633 --> 00:20:44.834
It's okay. Honestly I.

462
00:20:44.967 --> 00:20:47.834
I think I pitched better
because I didn't have them.

463
00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:49.667
You know. I had to
rely on myself.

464
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.667
So what were
you pitching?

465
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.333
I think I saw
on your profile

466
00:20:52.467 --> 00:20:54.000
you're an app developer
or something?

467
00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:55.000
Yeah.

468
00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:57.934
Actually. I co-own DigiLove.

469
00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:02.567
The-the-the one we're
here right now on?

470
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.934
The one and only.

471
00:21:04.066 --> 00:21:05.200
Wow!

472
00:21:05.734 --> 00:21:08.433
So you mean to tell me I
am on a date with the woman

473
00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.033
behind the latest and
greatest matchmaking service.

474
00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:13.033
(laughs) That's a
really nice rhyme.

475
00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:17.533
(laughs) You know.
full disclosure.

476
00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:21.033
I'm not usually a
dating app kind of guy.

477
00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.400
You're not?

478
00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:26.200
Okay. so what made you want
to get an account with us?

479
00:21:26.333 --> 00:21:28.200
I was forced into it.

480
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:29.533
A friend of mine
was signing up.

481
00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:31.200
and he didn't want
to do it alone.

482
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:35.300
And so. lo and behold.
here I am.

483
00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:37.066
And has he matched
with anyone yet?

484
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.500
No. not yet.

485
00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:40.734
But. you know. I think
he's looking forward
to more users. and-

486
00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:42.066
Yeah. he and I both.

487
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.500
(laughs) I bet.

488
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.233
So can I ask.
creative gardener?

489
00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:50.066
What does that mean. exactly?

490
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.567
Uh. it means I arrange
plants and flowers

491
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.567
in creative ways.

492
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.233
Okay. sounds mysterious.

493
00:21:58.367 --> 00:21:59.667
Oh. very much so.

494
00:22:00.967 --> 00:22:04.467
No. to be honest. there's no
real definition for what I do.

495
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.133
It kind of depends on
the plant or flower

496
00:22:08.266 --> 00:22:10.000
that I'm working with.

497
00:22:10.133 --> 00:22:12.100
Okay. what does that mean?

498
00:22:12.233 --> 00:22:15.100
Oliver:
(laughs) Okay.
so for instance.

499
00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:18.100
let's say I'm working
with red roses.

500
00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:21.767
Then the piece is maybe gonna
be a bit more like romantic.

501
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.266
But if I'm working
with dahlias.

502
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.600
then the installation's
more dramatic.

503
00:22:25.734 --> 00:22:27.100
Installation.

504
00:22:27.233 --> 00:22:28.433
So you're an artist.

505
00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:29.600
Yeah.
-
Okay.

506
00:22:29.734 --> 00:22:32.100
It's just rather than
working with white canvas.

507
00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:34.033
I'm working with dirt.

508
00:22:34.734 --> 00:22:36.266
Are you the one that
designed that plant wall

509
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.433
in Ms. Lee's building?

510
00:22:37.567 --> 00:22:38.433
Yeah.

511
00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:39.734
Wow!

512
00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:42.700
(stammers) It's not totally
finished. but yeah. that's me.

513
00:22:44.433 --> 00:22:47.233
So how do you like
running your own company?

514
00:22:47.934 --> 00:22:50.734
(sighs) I do.

515
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.300
Yeah. I-I do. yeah.

516
00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:55.300
Why the hesitation?

517
00:22:55.433 --> 00:22:57.133
It's. I love the
creative part of it.

518
00:22:57.266 --> 00:22:59.800
but the business side.
not so much.

519
00:22:59.934 --> 00:23:01.367
But. you know.
I'm not very good

520
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.867
when it comes to dates and
times and appointments and...

521
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.700
There's this app
on your phone.

522
00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:08.533
It-it's called. uh.
the calendar app.

523
00:23:08.667 --> 00:23:10.367
Ah. the calendar app
on my phone.

524
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.800
I always forget about that.

525
00:23:11.934 --> 00:23:13.266
(Zoe laughs)

526
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.800
Oliver:
I'm more of a stop and
smell the roses kind of guy.

527
00:23:15.934 --> 00:23:20.000
literally. and less of a.
like alphabetize my Rolodex.

528
00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:21.333
Zoe:
Well. lucky for you.

529
00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:23.333
organization is a
teachable skill.

530
00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:25.500
You can learn it with a
little bit of practice.

531
00:23:25.633 --> 00:23:27.834
You just train your brain.
you know?

532
00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:30.934
Well. my company could
use a brain like yours.

533
00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:33.000
Well. I can help you
with that if you want.

534
00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:34.000
Really?

535
00:23:34.133 --> 00:23:35.834
Yeah. of course.
why not?

536
00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:38.166
And I can teach you how
to hold a door open too

537
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.166
while I'm at it.

538
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.166
Oh. wow.

539
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.834
Not gonna let me
live that down. huh?

540
00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:43.433
(Zoe and Oliver laugh)

541
00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:46.433
Oh. hey.

542
00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.100
Thank you.

543
00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:50.033
Oliver:
And what did I get?

544
00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:51.533
Hey. green juice.

545
00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:53.200
Nice. good so far.

546
00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:54.700
And a Hawaiian pizza.

547
00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:56.700
Let the universe decide.
and you win.

548
00:23:56.834 --> 00:23:57.867
Do you see what happens

549
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.867
when you open yourself
up to surprises?

550
00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:06.266
(playful music)

551
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.700
Huh.

552
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.200
Huh? What?

553
00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:12.200
It's just funny.
'cause you and I.

554
00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:14.700
we aren't really
alike at all.

555
00:24:14.834 --> 00:24:17.533
It's funny that we
matched at 98%.

556
00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:19.200
Is that uncommon?

557
00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:20.533
Very.

558
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.200
We put a lot of research
into making sure

559
00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:24.066
we get our compatibility
numbers right

560
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.400
and-and please don't
take this the wrong way.

561
00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:28.834
but I think maybe something's
up with our algorithm.

562
00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:32.400
Why. are people
usually more similar?

563
00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:33.834
Ah. not in all ways. no.

564
00:24:34.533 --> 00:24:36.233
But in key areas. yeah.

565
00:24:36.367 --> 00:24:37.667
What are key areas?

566
00:24:38.867 --> 00:24:41.233
You don't keep a calendar

567
00:24:41.367 --> 00:24:42.900
and you're spontaneous.

568
00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:44.066
Those are key areas.

569
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.734
What's wrong with
being spontaneous?

570
00:24:45.867 --> 00:24:47.066
And you like
Hawaiian pizza.

571
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.734
What. it is delicious!

572
00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:49.734
Mm.

573
00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:51.066
Oliver:
Just-just. come on.

574
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.400
it is sweet and
salty and tangy.

575
00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:54.400
Just give it a shot.

576
00:24:54.533 --> 00:24:55.567
I'm good.
-Come on. just try it.

577
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.600
Why would I want to
put fruit on my pizza?

578
00:24:57.734 --> 00:25:00.333
I'm not chopping up mangoes
and putting it in my spaghetti.

579
00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:01.433
(Zoe and Oliver laugh)

580
00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.500
All right. well what
kind of pizza do you like?

581
00:25:03.633 --> 00:25:04.934
Cheese.

582
00:25:05.633 --> 00:25:06.500
And?

583
00:25:06.633 --> 00:25:07.500
Cheese.

584
00:25:07.633 --> 00:25:08.500
Cheese. just.

585
00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:09.834
just cheese pizza?

586
00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:11.033
Cheese pizza.

587
00:25:11.734 --> 00:25:14.600
You find just cheese
so delicious.

588
00:25:14.734 --> 00:25:15.600
Yeah.

589
00:25:15.734 --> 00:25:18.934
Wow. that is so boring.

590
00:25:19.066 --> 00:25:20.100
Come on. you gotta
live a little!

591
00:25:20.233 --> 00:25:23.433
You need to try a
really good cheese pizza.

592
00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:25.533
because it is like
heaven on earth.

593
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.600
All right. you might be right.

594
00:25:28.734 --> 00:25:29.967
We're pretty different.

595
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.300
(Zoe and Oliver laugh)

596
00:25:31.433 --> 00:25:32.467
Is that a deal breaker. or?

597
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.300
Oliver:
No. you know what.

598
00:25:34.433 --> 00:25:36.300
if I can be
completely honest.

599
00:25:36.433 --> 00:25:37.633
this is good.
it's easy.

600
00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:41.133
It's like. it's like
we're old friends.

601
00:25:41.266 --> 00:25:43.066
Yeah. ditto.

602
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.967
So maybe

603
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.567
you could teach me
how to organize?

604
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.300
For sure. as friends.

605
00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:55.133
Oliver:
Right. of course.
as-as friends.

606
00:25:55.266 --> 00:25:58.133
And as your friend. I
feel like it is my duty

607
00:25:58.266 --> 00:26:02.033
to convince you about
what you're missing

608
00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:04.066
with delicious
Hawaiian pizza.

609
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.333
(sighs) You got your
work cut out for you.

610
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.100
So I-I could swing by your
office tomorrow if you're free?

611
00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:13.333
That sounds great.

612
00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:15.100
Let me just check
my schedule.

613
00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:20.834
I can make 2:15
to 3:15 work.

614
00:26:20.967 --> 00:26:21.900
That good for you?

615
00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:23.834
Oh. uh. I don't know.
let me check my schedule.

616
00:26:23.967 --> 00:26:25.266
Oh. yeah. no.
I'm good.

617
00:26:27.633 --> 00:26:29.166
(Zoe laughs)

618
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.166
(gentle music)

619
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.433
Jillian:
Okay.

620
00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:36.333
Morning!

621
00:26:36.467 --> 00:26:37.533
You're here early.

622
00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:38.867
Oh. yeah.
I couldn't sleep.

623
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.367
Ugh. been there.

624
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.033
So. how was your big date?

625
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:45.367
Should I start planning
wedding invitations now or?

626
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.700
(laughs) I think maybe we
need to look into the algorithm.

627
00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:49.867
see if we missed something.

628
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.033
It went that badly. huh?

629
00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:55.533
Mm. it's not that it
didn't go well. it's just...

630
00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:56.700
What is it?

631
00:26:56.834 --> 00:26:58.700
He likes Hawaiian pizza.

632
00:26:58.834 --> 00:26:59.700
Say no more.

633
00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:00.934
That's a deal breaker.

634
00:27:01.066 --> 00:27:03.100
(laughs) No. it's
not about the pizza

635
00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:04.767
it's about what the
pizza represents.

636
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.934
We're just so different.

637
00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:09.433
Jillian:
Well. you know our app
accounts for that though. right?

638
00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:12.066
We're not trying to match
couples with twin personalities.

639
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.400
I know. but I looked
into our classes

640
00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:17.900
and he's a Class Y
and I'm a Class B.

641
00:27:18.033 --> 00:27:20.734
We both know those are the
most incompatible classes.

642
00:27:20.867 --> 00:27:22.567
Huh. that is weird.

643
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.667
Zoe:
Yeah.

644
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.734
And then I tried to do a
social media deep dive.

645
00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:28.667
but he's virtually
non-existent online.

646
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.133
So what's your plan?

647
00:27:30.266 --> 00:27:31.066
Zoe:
Gonna have to
do some digging

648
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.066
the old fashioned way.

649
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.233
Actually. he's
gonna come in later

650
00:27:34.367 --> 00:27:35.734
so I can help him out
with his website.

651
00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:38.667
So maybe I can figure
out why we matched.

652
00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:41.900
So you're gonna spend
more time with him

653
00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:45.433
because you don't think that
there's relationship potential.

654
00:27:45.567 --> 00:27:46.934
Uh huh.

655
00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:49.600
Well. I will ask Leo to
look into the algorithm

656
00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.600
and I'll let you know
if we find anything.

657
00:27:51.734 --> 00:27:54.934
But what is our Plan B
if your theory is right

658
00:27:55.066 --> 00:27:57.033
and you and Oliver
aren't compatible?

659
00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.934
Still working on it.

660
00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:01.433
Okay.

661
00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:10.166
(playful music)

662
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.533
(Zoe sighs)

663
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:23.967
Hey.
-Hey.

664
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.967
Sorry I'm late.
but hey.

665
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.967
I got you this to say
thanks for your help.

666
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.066
That was nice of you.
thank you.

667
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.900
What is it?

668
00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:36.066
That's a chai latte.

669
00:28:36.767 --> 00:28:37.967
Huh.

670
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.300
Never had one of
these before.

671
00:28:40.433 --> 00:28:42.400
And how do you like it?

672
00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:44.900
It's actually quite good.

673
00:28:45.033 --> 00:28:51.834
(gentle music)

674
00:28:51.967 --> 00:28:55.166
♪

675
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.333
Okay. the first and most
important tip I can give you.

676
00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:00.567
be honest.

677
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.900
Be honest. okay.

678
00:29:02.033 --> 00:29:03.734
Honesty is important
all the time.

679
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:06.233
but especially with
your online presence.

680
00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:08.400
Your brand represents you.

681
00:29:08.533 --> 00:29:11.166
So however you put
yourself out there.

682
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.100
make sure it's an accurate
reflection of who you are.

683
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.667
Okay.

684
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.667
Okay?

685
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.667
Your website is
out of date.

686
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.333
unintuitive and
frankly unappealing.

687
00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:24.700
Ugh. don't hold back.

688
00:29:24.834 --> 00:29:28.533
(laughs) But your
floral pieces are modern.

689
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.300
natural and beautiful.

690
00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.033
You see the disconnect?

691
00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:34.300
Point taken.

692
00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:37.033
We'll need some
newer photos.

693
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:39.200
and I can help you
with that later.

694
00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:42.133
but for now. let's just
focus on your "about" page.

695
00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.467
"Established in 2014."

696
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.867
What's wrong with that?

697
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.300
I think we can make it
a little more personal.

698
00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:56.533
For starters. why did
you start the company?

699
00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:58.066
What inspired you?

700
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.066
My grandmother.

701
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.000
We used to garden
together all the time.

702
00:30:02.533 --> 00:30:05.066
(gentle music)

703
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.233
And what do you
want people to feel

704
00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:09.834
when they see your work?

705
00:30:11.867 --> 00:30:13.834
Happiness. beauty.

706
00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:20.233
What else?
-Uh. let's see. I dunno.

707
00:30:20.367 --> 00:30:22.567
I guess inspired.

708
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.900
(peaceful music)

709
00:30:29.033 --> 00:30:30.100
Oliver:
This is so great.

710
00:30:30.233 --> 00:30:31.533
You were right.

711
00:30:32.066 --> 00:30:33.934
But. uh. now I'm
gonna have to find

712
00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:35.433
some other way
to thank you.

713
00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:37.767
'cause a latte is feeling
a bit lacklustre.

714
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.433
Well. funny.
you should ask.

715
00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:43.266
There is something I
would love your help with.

716
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.433
All right. shoot.

717
00:30:44.567 --> 00:30:45.600
You know how we
both thought

718
00:30:45.734 --> 00:30:48.934
that our 98% match
was a bit strange?

719
00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:50.600
The team thinks that we
may have missed something

720
00:30:50.734 --> 00:30:52.767
on your profile build.

721
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.934
All right. so
what do you need?

722
00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:58.100
I was-I was wondering if
you and I hung out more.

723
00:30:58.233 --> 00:31:02.333
then maybe I would be
able to put my finger

724
00:31:02.467 --> 00:31:07.767
on what I wasn't able to
calculate or consider.

725
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.900
So are you asking me
to hang out more?

726
00:31:13.934 --> 00:31:16.133
For science. yes.

727
00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:20.233
Oh. well. if it's for science.
then I can do that.

728
00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:24.233
And I think we should do
something that you love to do.

729
00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:27.133
Okay. yeah.

730
00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:29.233
Uh. I think I have an idea.

731
00:31:30.266 --> 00:31:31.300
So we have a deal?

732
00:31:31.433 --> 00:31:32.734
We have a deal.

733
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.233
(phone chimes)

734
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.100
music)

735
00:31:45.233 --> 00:31:47.433
Jillian:
Wow. this is weird.

736
00:31:47.567 --> 00:31:49.433
Yeah. really weird.

737
00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:50.767
It doesn't make any sense.

738
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.934
The code all looks
perfect to me.

739
00:31:52.066 --> 00:31:54.033
Told ya.
our code is crisp.

740
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.767
And you checked all
the sub-designs?

741
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.367
And all the variables.

742
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.600
Huh.

743
00:31:59.734 --> 00:32:01.333
Well. thanks for
looking into it. Leo.

744
00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:02.333
I appreciate it.

745
00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:04.433
Yeah. no probs.
boss lady.

746
00:32:08.467 --> 00:32:11.033
Class B's and Class Y's
are never compatible.

747
00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:12.967
I'm still not convinced
we checked everything.

748
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.300
No. you're right.
it's weird.

749
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:16.633
And statistically unlikely.

750
00:32:16.767 --> 00:32:18.300
Well. I'll look into
it again tonight

751
00:32:18.433 --> 00:32:20.633
after I'm wrapped
up with Oliver.

752
00:32:20.767 --> 00:32:22.133
Oh. yes.

753
00:32:22.266 --> 00:32:25.133
How goes the research in the
romance department by the way?

754
00:32:25.266 --> 00:32:26.133
It's going all right.

755
00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:27.633
No discoveries yet though.

756
00:32:27.767 --> 00:32:29.133
I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

757
00:32:29.266 --> 00:32:31.233
I just hope I
can in time.

758
00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:33.967
I'm just gonna
take this. okay.

759
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.633
(upbeat music)

760
00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:36.800
Zoe:
All of that
sounds great.

761
00:32:36.934 --> 00:32:39.734
But how can you ensure we
get organic engagement?

762
00:32:40.767 --> 00:32:42.133
Right. okay.

763
00:32:42.266 --> 00:32:44.166
Well. listen. I think
we're on the right track.

764
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.000
How about a follow-up
call next week?

765
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:49.767
Is Wednesday good for you?

766
00:32:52.133 --> 00:32:53.033
Okay. perfect.

767
00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:55.100
I've got to run.
but we'll chat then.

768
00:32:56.133 --> 00:32:57.000
Hi.

769
00:32:57.133 --> 00:32:59.000
Hey. so you all set?

770
00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:00.500
Depends.
Where are we going?

771
00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:02.567
Grab your coat.

772
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:08.667
(playful music)

773
00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:18.200
(gentle music)

774
00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:19.467
Zoe: Wow.

775
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.967
Oliver. it is so
beautiful in here.

776
00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:26.367
My studio space
is close by.

777
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.033
so I spend a lot
of time here.

778
00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:30.700
Just come to
admire the plants?

779
00:33:30.834 --> 00:33:33.700
Yeah. you know.
get some inspiration.

780
00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:34.700
It's so peaceful.

781
00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:37.633
It's like a great place
to just meditate.

782
00:33:38.033 --> 00:33:39.300
Meditate. huh?

783
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.367
And think of nothing?

784
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.533
That's the one.

785
00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:44.367
(laughs) Never tried it.

786
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.533
Really?
-Yeah.

787
00:33:46.667 --> 00:33:48.467
Here. here.
take a seat.

788
00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:55.233
So the trick to meditation

789
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.567
is you want to try to
really be in the moment.

790
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.467
And how exactly
does one do that?

791
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.467
Well. much like organization.

792
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.567
it is a skill that
can be taught.

793
00:34:05.433 --> 00:34:07.233
Why does that
sound so familiar?

794
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:09.800
Okay. what do we do?

795
00:34:09.934 --> 00:34:11.667
All right.
close your eyes.

796
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.066
(Zoe sighs)

797
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.667
And focus on your breath.

798
00:34:15.867 --> 00:34:19.066
It-it helps if you have. um.
a phrase to come back to.

799
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.400
Like a mantra?

800
00:34:20.533 --> 00:34:21.734
Yeah. exactly.

801
00:34:21.867 --> 00:34:22.734
Okay.

802
00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:24.600
There's no rules
when picking one.

803
00:34:24.734 --> 00:34:26.367
just whatever
works for you.

804
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:33.266
What about "I have to pick
up shampoo on the way home"?

805
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.600
Hmm. not bad

806
00:34:35.734 --> 00:34:37.767
but maybe. uh. let's
keep brainstorming.

807
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.367
(laughs) Okay.

808
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.100
Oh. we have a motto at work.

809
00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:44.600
"One step at a time."

810
00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.934
Yeah. now that is perfect.

811
00:34:47.066 --> 00:34:48.266
Yeah. when we were
building the company.

812
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.934
Jillian and me.

813
00:34:50.066 --> 00:34:51.600
we were getting
so overwhelmed

814
00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:52.934
with all the little
things that we had to do.

815
00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:56.100
so we'd say to each other.
"One step at a time."

816
00:34:56.233 --> 00:34:58.800
And then all those tasks
just seemed more manageable.

817
00:34:58.934 --> 00:34:59.967
Did it help?

818
00:35:00.166 --> 00:35:01.100
Definitely.

819
00:35:01.233 --> 00:35:03.533
We still say it to each
other all the time.

820
00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:05.633
Well. then I think
that'll work great.

821
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.800
Okay.

822
00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:10.300
(Zoe sighs)

823
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.734
One step at a time.

824
00:35:15.934 --> 00:35:17.467
One step at a time.

825
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.133
(Oliver laughs)

826
00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:22.133
(whispering) You're supposed
to say it in your head.

827
00:35:22.266 --> 00:35:23.300
Mmhmm. mmhmm. right.

828
00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:24.900
(Oliver laughs)

829
00:35:26.767 --> 00:35:27.900
(Zoe sighs)

830
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.834
Am I supposed to be
like making lists

831
00:35:33.967 --> 00:35:35.000
of all the things
that I have to do?

832
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.500
Yeah. that is totally normal.

833
00:35:36.633 --> 00:35:37.834
Okay. okay.

834
00:35:37.967 --> 00:35:40.500
But. you know. you just
come back to your mantra.

835
00:35:40.633 --> 00:35:42.333
Whenever you find yourself
making a list of errands.

836
00:35:42.467 --> 00:35:45.000
you just tell yourself.
"one step at a time."

837
00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:46.266
Okay.

838
00:35:48.133 --> 00:35:51.500
I promise. you do this
fifteen minutes every day.

839
00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:54.000
you would not believe
how calm it makes you.

840
00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:55.834
Well. it sounds
very relaxing.

841
00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:59.600
but I don't really have
fifteen minutes to spare.

842
00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:01.834
You will thank me later.

843
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.433
Okay. I'll think about it.

844
00:36:05.567 --> 00:36:07.100
(peaceful music)

845
00:36:07.233 --> 00:36:10.033
(gasps) Wow. this is so pretty!

846
00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.033
What is this one?

847
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:15.700
That's called a cordyline.

848
00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:17.300
It's beautiful.

849
00:36:19.667 --> 00:36:22.033
So. how do you relax?

850
00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:24.367
(peaceful music)

851
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.467
Well. I really enjoy
filing my taxes.

852
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.967
(laughs) You just don't
know how to turn it off. huh?

853
00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.867
I wouldn't say that.

854
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.967
I just like to
get things done

855
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.000
so then I don't have to
worry about it later.

856
00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.400
You don't like tax season?

857
00:36:43.533 --> 00:36:44.400
Uh. no.

858
00:36:44.533 --> 00:36:46.567
See. I am what they
call a normal person.

859
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.233
Ah. right. right.

860
00:36:48.367 --> 00:36:49.900
(gasps) Wow. what
are these ones?

861
00:36:50.033 --> 00:36:50.900
They're gorgeous!

862
00:36:51.033 --> 00:36:52.166
Flamingo flower.

863
00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:54.166
Huh.

864
00:36:56.533 --> 00:36:58.066
So enlighten me.

865
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.967
what does a
"normal person" like?

866
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.066
I dunno. good food.

867
00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:06.300
I love horror movies.
uh. sports.

868
00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:07.433
Oh.

869
00:37:07.567 --> 00:37:10.133
I used to play basketball
and soccer in high school.

870
00:37:10.266 --> 00:37:11.433
Really?
-Yeah.

871
00:37:11.567 --> 00:37:12.700
Hmm.

872
00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:15.367
What?

873
00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:17.767
You strike me as
more of an indoor kid.

874
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.367
Wow.

875
00:37:21.567 --> 00:37:22.934
Well I guess I'm gonna have
to prove you wrong then.

876
00:37:23.066 --> 00:37:24.200
I guess so.

877
00:37:24.567 --> 00:37:29.767
(playful music)

878
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.266
Oliver:
So soccer and basketball?

879
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.100
Zoe:
Yeah. don't look
so surprised.

880
00:37:33.233 --> 00:37:40.200
(muffled chatting)
(playful music)

881
00:37:43.567 --> 00:37:44.967
What's that plant?

882
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.967
Oh. yeah.

883
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.633
Well that beautiful
one is a weed

884
00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:49.967
that should have
been pulled out.

885
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.400
I'll let somebody know.

886
00:37:56.266 --> 00:37:57.967
So I noticed you got a
hundred new followers

887
00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.967
on social yesterday.

888
00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.967
Oh. really?

889
00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:01.033
Yeah.

890
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:03.133
I always forget to
check up on that stuff.

891
00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:06.200
Did you get any
new clients yet?

892
00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:07.867
No. not yet.

893
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.300
I wish. I could use some.

894
00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:16.233
What are you doing
next weekend?

895
00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:19.100
Let me check my schedule.

896
00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:22.000
Look at you with
your schedule.

897
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.934
Yeah. and nothing yet.

898
00:38:24.633 --> 00:38:25.834
Okay.

899
00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:28.000
What would you think
about doing an exhibit

900
00:38:28.133 --> 00:38:29.667
to showcase your art?

901
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.500
Yeah. I've done farmer's
markets and stuff.

902
00:38:32.633 --> 00:38:34.000
but I always end
up losing money

903
00:38:34.133 --> 00:38:36.000
'cause of the hosting costs.

904
00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:37.266
(sighs) True.

905
00:38:38.133 --> 00:38:39.333
It's hard to get
around that.

906
00:38:39.467 --> 00:38:40.667
Yeah.

907
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.000
Unless...

908
00:38:42.133 --> 00:38:43.166
Unless?

909
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.500
Unless you have a
really great friend

910
00:38:44.633 --> 00:38:47.834
who's got a really great
space in her building.

911
00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:50.100
It's gonna need some
surface touch-ups. but.

912
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.967
(sighs) I dunno. that
sounds like a lot of work.

913
00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:55.533
Yeah.

914
00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.633
Everything worth doing
is a lot of work.

915
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.100
No. I mean for you.

916
00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:02.700
I don't want to put
that on your shoulders.

917
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.433
I would be so happy
to help. seriously.

918
00:39:07.567 --> 00:39:08.600
Really?

919
00:39:08.734 --> 00:39:10.033
Yeah.

920
00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:13.000
I'll tell you what.

921
00:39:13.133 --> 00:39:15.367
if you don't get at least ten
new clients at the exhibit.

922
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.867
I'll commission you myself.

923
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.800
(laughs) I can't
say no to that.

924
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.233
All right. but we're
gonna have to find a way

925
00:39:24.367 --> 00:39:27.066
to promote DigiLove too.
you know.

926
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.900
like make sure DigiLove
posters are everywhere.

927
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.066
you know. cross-pollinate.

928
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.400
Well. well. well.

929
00:39:32.533 --> 00:39:34.734
it looks like you do have some
business savvy after all.

930
00:39:34.867 --> 00:39:36.166
Uh huh.

931
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.066
DigiLove presents:
Beckett's Botanical Designs.

932
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.333
Sign me up!

933
00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:44.900
Hey. since you're the one
with all the good ideas.

934
00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:47.333
why don't you pick the
activity for next time?

935
00:39:49.867 --> 00:39:51.166
So you want to
hang out again?

936
00:39:52.367 --> 00:39:56.233
Yeah. I'm as invested in
this experiment as you are.

937
00:39:56.367 --> 00:39:58.834
Plus. I'm dying to see what
your version of fun is.

938
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.433
(laughs) All right.

939
00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:06.033
Just promise me we won't
spend the night doing our taxes.

940
00:40:07.233 --> 00:40:08.266
You like baseball?

941
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.266
Oh yeah. I love it.

942
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.867
You want to go to a game?

943
00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:14.033
Actually. I had
something else in mind.

944
00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:18.767
(peaceful music)

945
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.200
(gasps) Look at the fish!

946
00:40:25.567 --> 00:40:27.600
er?

947
00:40:27.734 --> 00:40:28.600
Zoe:
Correct.

948
00:40:28.734 --> 00:40:30.266
Jillian:
For free?

949
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.133
Not for free.

950
00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:34.967
More like for no money.

951
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:35.967
Hmm.

952
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.300
Wait. what did I say?

953
00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:38.633
We're gonna be
promoting DigiLove

954
00:40:38.767 --> 00:40:41.467
at an event where there
will be a lot of people.

955
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.467
Right.

956
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.133
Okay. well. it's
all cool by me.

957
00:40:44.266 --> 00:40:48.133
But I must say that
Oliver is one lucky fella

958
00:40:48.266 --> 00:40:49.633
to have you as a friend.

959
00:40:49.767 --> 00:40:50.633
What do you mean?

960
00:40:50.767 --> 00:40:53.734
Just very generous
with your time is all.

961
00:40:54.433 --> 00:40:56.800
It's all good research
for the company.

962
00:40:56.934 --> 00:40:58.066
Okay.

963
00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:02.133
(phone chimes)

964
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.734
What is it?

965
00:41:06.867 --> 00:41:08.667
I just matched
with someone else.

966
00:41:11.967 --> 00:41:13.834
At 90%.

967
00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:14.834
What?!

968
00:41:14.967 --> 00:41:15.834
Oh wow.

969
00:41:15.967 --> 00:41:18.000
(both laugh)

970
00:41:18.133 --> 00:41:19.333
I can't believe it.

971
00:41:19.467 --> 00:41:21.433
I think what you
mean is: yay!

972
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.767
(phone buzzes)

973
00:41:24.133 --> 00:41:26.667
If this is a third match.
I swear.

974
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.100
It's Ms. Lee's office.

975
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.500
Zoe Williams speaking.

976
00:41:32.633 --> 00:41:34.500
Ms. Lee:
Ms. Williams.
it's Ms. Lee.

977
00:41:34.633 --> 00:41:35.667
How are things?

978
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.700
I wanted to check in
on your progress.

979
00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:39.200
It's going really well.

980
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:40.867
We actually have a
couple of options

981
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.200
of who we might
bring in now.

982
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.533
Ms. Lee:
I'm looking forward to it.

983
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.700
Listen. I'm glad things
are going so well

984
00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:47.700
because my trip to
Shanghai has moved up

985
00:41:47.834 --> 00:41:50.133
and we might need to
reschedule our meeting.

986
00:41:51.333 --> 00:41:52.867
Is everything okay?

987
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.200
Yes. I just have to travel
sooner than originally planned.

988
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:58.200
Are you available a
few days earlier?

989
00:41:58.333 --> 00:41:59.867
Of course. we can
move the meeting up.

990
00:42:00.066 --> 00:42:00.934
no problem.

991
00:42:01.066 --> 00:42:02.266
Ms. Lee:
Great.

992
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.266
Truthfully. I'm sorry to
take time away from our deal.

993
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.433
but you seem confident in the
couples you have lined up.

994
00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:09.433
We are very confident.

995
00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:11.633
Ms. Lee:
Well I appreciate
your flexibility.

996
00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:13.567
My assistant will
set something up.

997
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.834
Goodbye for now.

998
00:42:17.367 --> 00:42:18.500
(Zoe laughs)

999
00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:20.900
Well. I guess
it's a good thing

1000
00:42:21.033 --> 00:42:22.734
you just made
another match.

1001
00:42:22.867 --> 00:42:23.734
Mmhmm.

1002
00:42:23.867 --> 00:42:26.066
(upbeat music)

1003
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.567
Dear Bachelor #2.

1004
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.567
I'm 90% sure we're
going for coffee.

1005
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.900
When's good for you?

1006
00:42:32.033 --> 00:42:33.400
I would never say that.

1007
00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:34.667
(Jillian laughs)

1008
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.066
(sighs) But I guess I am
setting up another date?

1009
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.000
What about Oliver?

1010
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.767
Right. right.
you're just friends.

1011
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.100
Zoe:
And it's my
duty as CEO

1012
00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:50.767
to give us our best
possible chance of success.

1013
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.934
I have to explore
every option.

1014
00:42:53.066 --> 00:42:56.100
Okay. so what are you
gonna do for this date?

1015
00:42:56.233 --> 00:42:57.266
Candlelit dinner?

1016
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.367
Horseback riding
in the park?

1017
00:43:00.467 --> 00:43:02.000
Well I guess if I
want comparable results.

1018
00:43:02.133 --> 00:43:04.166
I'm gonna have to go to
the same cafe. right?

1019
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.166
Oh you're setting up a date.
not a scientific experiment.

1020
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.000
Yeah but they have
really good pastries.

1021
00:43:10.133 --> 00:43:12.200
Oh. well.
now you're talking.

1022
00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:20.633
(upbeat music)

1023
00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:23.233
(phone chimes)

1024
00:43:24.934 --> 00:43:27.233
(Zoe laughs)

1025
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.967
David:
Zoe? Hey.

1026
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.300
Hi. it's great to meet you.

1027
00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:34.467
Likewise.

1028
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.800
Hey. where'd you find
out about this cafe?

1029
00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:38.800
I walk by here every
day on my way to work

1030
00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:40.467
and I had no
idea it existed.

1031
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.467
A friend brought
me here once.

1032
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600
Where do you work?

1033
00:43:43.734 --> 00:43:45.633
Oh. just south a couple
blocks on Commerce Way.

1034
00:43:45.767 --> 00:43:47.467
I'm a financial advisor.

1035
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.300
I work in the big
green building.

1036
00:43:49.433 --> 00:43:51.233
So you're good
with numbers.

1037
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.767
Hey. I'll take a latte and
an almond croissant. please.

1038
00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.433
I'll have the same.

1039
00:44:00.867 --> 00:44:02.000
Hmm.

1040
00:44:02.567 --> 00:44:03.900
That's kind of freaky.

1041
00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:05.066
It's my exact order.

1042
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.734
Really?
-Yeah.

1043
00:44:06.867 --> 00:44:09.667
I guess that's what
makes us so compatible.

1044
00:44:10.533 --> 00:44:12.166
I guess so.

1045
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.500
So what made you want to
get into financial advising?

1046
00:44:15.633 --> 00:44:17.000
It's just something
I've always been good at.

1047
00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:20.333
I figured it'd be the best
logical career choice for me.

1048
00:44:20.467 --> 00:44:22.667
That's sort of what I did
with my business partner.

1049
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.867
We went to college together
and. uh. we had the same goals.

1050
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.033
Mm. and where did
you go to college?

1051
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:29.033
M.I.T.

1052
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.033
(laughs) I went to Harvard.

1053
00:44:31.166 --> 00:44:32.200
Wow.

1054
00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:33.533
What a small world.

1055
00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:34.800
So small.

1056
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.200
I'm sure we crossed
paths at some point.

1057
00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:39.300
Yeah. probably.

1058
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.033
Hmm.
-
Huh.

1059
00:44:41.166 --> 00:44:43.467
So what do you like to
do in your free time?

1060
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.467
Oh.

1061
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.533
Honestly. I don't
have much free time.

1062
00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:50.033
I. I work long hours.

1063
00:44:50.166 --> 00:44:51.033
Same here.

1064
00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:52.700
David:
But as far as hobbies go.

1065
00:44:52.834 --> 00:44:55.633
I guess you could
say I love games.

1066
00:44:56.834 --> 00:44:57.900
What kind of games?

1067
00:44:58.033 --> 00:44:59.400
(laughs) Well. everything.

1068
00:44:59.533 --> 00:45:02.300
Um. board games.
video games. sports.

1069
00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.300
Doesn't matter.

1070
00:45:03.433 --> 00:45:05.800
I just. I love a
little competition.

1071
00:45:05.934 --> 00:45:07.300
And what about you?

1072
00:45:07.433 --> 00:45:09.800
Well. I guess that's
something we can add

1073
00:45:09.934 --> 00:45:11.900
to the list of things
we have in common.

1074
00:45:14.867 --> 00:45:17.233
Mm. this is incredible.

1075
00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:18.400
Mmm.

1076
00:45:18.533 --> 00:45:20.567
So. what about pizza?

1077
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.900
You a fan?

1078
00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:22.900
Isn't everyone?

1079
00:45:23.033 --> 00:45:24.066
I know this great
little pizzeria.

1080
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.734
They have the best cheese
slices you'll ever have.

1081
00:45:26.867 --> 00:45:28.000
Oh. yeah?

1082
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.734
Look. this is a lot of fun.

1083
00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:31.100
and you seem really cool.

1084
00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:34.100
Plus. 90% compatibility.

1085
00:45:34.233 --> 00:45:35.934
Those are some good odds.

1086
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:39.266
(playful music)

1087
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.533
Mmhmm.

1088
00:45:41.233 --> 00:45:48.100
(upbeat music)

1089
00:45:48.233 --> 00:45:58.200
♪

1090
00:45:59.233 --> 00:46:02.266
Wow! You are really
good at this. huh?

1091
00:46:03.967 --> 00:46:08.033
(playful music)

1092
00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:09.633
Wow. look at you!

1093
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:13.133
(laughs) Care to make
things interesting?

1094
00:46:13.266 --> 00:46:14.467
Depends.

1095
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.900
What's at stake?

1096
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.967
Mm. loser buys ice cream?

1097
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.800
Ah. you are on.

1098
00:46:21.934 --> 00:46:27.800
(playful music)

1099
00:46:27.934 --> 00:46:29.066
Oh!

1100
00:46:30.266 --> 00:46:31.734
Oliver:
Just a little rusty.

1101
00:46:32.767 --> 00:46:33.900
(Zoe laughs)

1102
00:46:34.767 --> 00:46:35.900
(Oliver grunts)

1103
00:46:36.266 --> 00:46:38.166
That was really good form.

1104
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.433
Thanks. coach.

1105
00:46:43.633 --> 00:46:44.500
Ah!

1106
00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:45.500
Oof!

1107
00:46:45.633 --> 00:46:47.667
All right. maybe
I'm a lot rusty.

1108
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.500
Zoe:
Okay. it's not
really that fair.

1109
00:46:49.633 --> 00:46:52.600
I have a bit of
an advantage.

1110
00:46:53.166 --> 00:46:54.834
Oh yeah. what's that?

1111
00:46:54.967 --> 00:46:56.433
I come here once a week.

1112
00:46:57.133 --> 00:46:58.333
(bat cracks)

1113
00:46:58.467 --> 00:47:01.333
So basically. this is your
version of meditation then?

1114
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.333
Yeah.

1115
00:47:03.867 --> 00:47:06.233
Isn't it so much better
than thinking about nothing?

1116
00:47:06.367 --> 00:47:07.900
(bat cracks)

1117
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:10.400
Oh it's definitely better
than doing your taxes.

1118
00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:11.667
I'll say that.

1119
00:47:12.233 --> 00:47:14.467
Except for now I'm out
ten bucks for ice cream.

1120
00:47:17.166 --> 00:47:18.300
All right. all right.

1121
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.700
Oh. no. no. no. no.

1122
00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:22.533
You already put me
to enough shame.

1123
00:47:22.667 --> 00:47:23.867
(Zoe laughs)

1124
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.200
Well just be lucky that
I didn't go full throttle.

1125
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:28.200
Really?

1126
00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:30.033
What does full throttle
Zoe look like?

1127
00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:31.700
You get all angry
like the Hulk?

1128
00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:34.867
(laughs) No. but there
is a victory dance.

1129
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.033
Well that I gotta see.

1130
00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:37.033
I mean. come on.
you won.

1131
00:47:37.166 --> 00:47:38.100
Get dancing.

1132
00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:40.367
No. I do not know you
well enough for that yet.

1133
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.867
You'll know I trust
you when you see it.

1134
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.800
Well. I look forward
to that day.

1135
00:47:47.033 --> 00:47:48.400
All right. champ.

1136
00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:49.834
Let's get that ice cream.

1137
00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:52.734
So there's a lot
to choose from.

1138
00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:54.066
what are you gonna get?

1139
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.734
Oh. I always get.
you know what?

1140
00:47:56.867 --> 00:47:58.000
Surprise me.

1141
00:47:58.533 --> 00:48:00.467
Wow. Zoe. you are
a changed woman.

1142
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.800
(Zoe laughs)

1143
00:48:01.934 --> 00:48:03.300
I think it's okay to
take a risk on this.

1144
00:48:03.433 --> 00:48:04.967
Ice cream is
always delicious.

1145
00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.133
Fair enough.

1146
00:48:06.266 --> 00:48:08.800
Can I get. uh. one
honey pistachio

1147
00:48:08.934 --> 00:48:10.900
and one cayenne
chocolate please?

1148
00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:16.333
So are you excited
for the exhibit?

1149
00:48:16.867 --> 00:48:18.667
Yeah. very excited.

1150
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.266
You should stop by my
office in a couple of days.

1151
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.433
I'll show you the space

1152
00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:24.533
and we can make an
official game plan.

1153
00:48:25.066 --> 00:48:25.934
All right. yeah.

1154
00:48:26.066 --> 00:48:27.767
That sounds perfect.

1155
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.266
And I'll help you
set everything up.

1156
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.100
We both know that's
my specialty.

1157
00:48:31.233 --> 00:48:33.433
No. Zoe. you've already
done so much for me as it is.

1158
00:48:33.567 --> 00:48:37.100
I-I-I can't ask you to put
yourself out any further.

1159
00:48:37.233 --> 00:48:38.767
It's nothing. really.

1160
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:43.600
(peaceful music)

1161
00:48:43.734 --> 00:48:46.700
Mm. Oliver. you
have to try this.

1162
00:48:47.734 --> 00:48:49.867
Honey and pistachio.
who knew?

1163
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.300
Mm!

1164
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:56.800
(laughs) I am never going
back to vanilla again.

1165
00:48:56.934 --> 00:49:01.967
(peaceful music)

1166
00:49:06.967 --> 00:49:08.834
So. what do you think?

1167
00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:11.166
Wow. I mean.
this space is perfect.

1168
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.867
Yeah. we're so lucky.

1169
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.600
I was thinking we can put
some of your work up here.

1170
00:49:16.734 --> 00:49:19.100
and then maybe hang
some from here.

1171
00:49:19.233 --> 00:49:20.934
Obviously we'll have
to do some tidying.

1172
00:49:21.066 --> 00:49:23.100
get some proper
overhead lighting.

1173
00:49:23.233 --> 00:49:26.633
and maybe even put a fresh
coat of paint on this wall.

1174
00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:28.800
Wow. you really are
the organization queen.

1175
00:49:28.934 --> 00:49:32.300
And we can set up some
refreshments here if you want.

1176
00:49:32.433 --> 00:49:34.633
Yeah. that is a
really good idea.

1177
00:49:34.767 --> 00:49:35.633
Hey. listen.

1178
00:49:35.767 --> 00:49:36.867
I know you're not much
of a plant person.

1179
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.133
but I was thinking since you're
hosting an event like this.

1180
00:49:40.266 --> 00:49:42.300
it's time you learn
just some of the basics.

1181
00:49:42.433 --> 00:49:44.467
Hmm. okay.

1182
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.734
So. you see anything
that. uh. you like?

1183
00:49:48.934 --> 00:49:50.800
Uh. that one's pretty.

1184
00:49:50.934 --> 00:49:52.133
This?
-Yeah.

1185
00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:53.300
This is a bromeliad.

1186
00:49:53.433 --> 00:49:54.467
He's pretty high maintenance.

1187
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.133
You gotta make sure
the water is just right.

1188
00:49:57.266 --> 00:49:58.834
not too wet.
not too dry.

1189
00:49:58.967 --> 00:50:00.500
Sometimes you
got to mist it.

1190
00:50:00.633 --> 00:50:01.500
Right.

1191
00:50:01.633 --> 00:50:03.333
Do you have anything
that doesn't require

1192
00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.333
a daily check-in?

1193
00:50:04.467 --> 00:50:05.667
(both laugh)

1194
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.834
Uh. yeah. I got
this one here.

1195
00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:07.834
This is an aloe.

1196
00:50:07.967 --> 00:50:10.000
You've probably seen
this one before.

1197
00:50:10.133 --> 00:50:12.000
So you gotta water
him once a week.

1198
00:50:12.133 --> 00:50:13.333
Sometimes every other week.

1199
00:50:13.467 --> 00:50:14.333
Sounds manageable.

1200
00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:15.600
Yeah.

1201
00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:17.000
He's kind of quirky.

1202
00:50:17.133 --> 00:50:18.667
Not your usual beauty.

1203
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.700
I like him.

1204
00:50:19.834 --> 00:50:21.767
He'll fit nicely
with my fake plants.

1205
00:50:24.133 --> 00:50:25.200
So when you're
transplanting.

1206
00:50:25.333 --> 00:50:26.333
you want to make sure
you have enough soil.

1207
00:50:26.467 --> 00:50:29.333
but not so much that
it can't breathe.

1208
00:50:29.467 --> 00:50:31.433
Just enough that
it stands upright.

1209
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.200
Pack it tight
but not too tight.

1210
00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:35.467
Got it.
-Yeah.

1211
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.533
Want to give it a shot?

1212
00:50:38.667 --> 00:50:39.800
Okay.

1213
00:50:42.667 --> 00:50:43.867
Ooh. oops.

1214
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.367
Oliver:
That's okay.

1215
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.467
You know. sometimes part of
the fun is about getting messy.

1216
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.700
So do you ever sketch
out your designs

1217
00:50:52.834 --> 00:50:54.200
ahead of time
before diving in?

1218
00:50:54.333 --> 00:50:55.867
Sometimes. but when
you're being creative

1219
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.200
you don't always
want to plan.

1220
00:50:57.333 --> 00:51:00.367
You know. you just
do what feels right.

1221
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.700
Well. everything is
coming together nicely.

1222
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.800
What's left to
do on your end?

1223
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:09.467
You know. a few
details like this

1224
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.300
but other than that
the big thing is.

1225
00:51:11.433 --> 00:51:13.066
I gotta get my
keys for my studio

1226
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.066
so I can bring all
the pieces over here.

1227
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.233
You don't have your keys?

1228
00:51:16.367 --> 00:51:18.233
(laughs) No. no.

1229
00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:19.834
my ex has them.

1230
00:51:22.033 --> 00:51:23.066
Oh.

1231
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.233
We started Beckett's
Botanicals together.

1232
00:51:25.367 --> 00:51:26.734
you know. she was
the administrator

1233
00:51:26.867 --> 00:51:27.734
and I was the artist.

1234
00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:28.734
Surprise. surprise.

1235
00:51:28.867 --> 00:51:30.166
(Zoe laughs)

1236
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.166
What. uh. what happened?

1237
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.500
(sighs) It's a long story.

1238
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.934
But. uh. anyway.

1239
00:51:39.066 --> 00:51:40.600
I lost my keys and she
has the master set

1240
00:51:40.734 --> 00:51:43.533
so I'm gonna have to meet
up with her and get them.

1241
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.266
Cool.

1242
00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.433
Well. I got to get going.

1243
00:51:46.567 --> 00:51:48.433
Lots of prep work to do.
-Oh.

1244
00:51:48.567 --> 00:51:51.266
But speaking of keys.
here. take those.

1245
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.433
You can just. uh. lock
up when you're done.

1246
00:51:53.567 --> 00:51:54.433
Okay.

1247
00:51:54.567 --> 00:51:56.533
Oh. hey. hey. hey.
don't forget your aloe.

1248
00:51:57.233 --> 00:51:59.767
Right. thanks again.
-Here you go.

1249
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.100

Hello.

1255
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.467
Hi.

1256
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.467
Uh oh. what happened?

1257
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.133
So I've been thinking.

1258

You know the past
relationship portion

1259

on our profile building?

1260
00:52:37.767 --> 00:52:38.967
What about it?

1261
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.467

I think we need more
questions on the questionnaire.

1262
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.633

for the interviews too.

This whole time I've
been looking at it

1271

wrong with our algorithm

to make sure.

1293
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.967

01:08:12.967 --> 01:08:14.233
I know. we're
really different.

1605
01:08:14.367 --> 01:08:17.400
but I think that's what
makes this so interesting.

1606
01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:19.800
And I know that we said we
were just gonna remain friends.

1607
01:08:19.934 --> 01:08:22.300
but the more time
we spend together.

1608
01:08:22.433 --> 01:08:25.600
the more I'm starting to
think your app is right.

1609
01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:28.133
(gentle music)

1610
01:08:28.266 --> 01:08:29.467
Well. in the
interest of honesty.

1611
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.567
there's something that
I should tell you.

1612
01:08:35.266 --> 01:08:36.800
We confirmed that the
numbers are wrong

1613
01:08:36.934 --> 01:08:38.734
for compatibility prediction.

1614
01:08:41.433 --> 01:08:42.867
Wrong how?

1615
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.633
We're not sure yet.

1616
01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:46.200
Leo's looking into it.

1617
01:08:47.767 --> 01:08:50.633
I don't know if maybe we
needed to be more comprehensive

1618
01:08:50.767 --> 01:08:52.834
with our relationship
history questions.

1619
01:08:52.967 --> 01:08:55.767
or if it was
something else but...

1620
01:08:56.967 --> 01:09:00.500
This isn't about my
ex Shannon. is it?

1621
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.400
Because believe me when I
say that is completely over.

1622
01:09:04.533 --> 01:09:06.967
She just came to be
supportive today.

1623
01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:10.066
Honestly. it's not
about that. no.

1624
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.066
At first I thought
maybe it was but.

1625
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.834
(sighs) does it
really matter?

1626
01:09:16.967 --> 01:09:18.333
Numbers are off.

1627
01:09:18.467 --> 01:09:19.900
I can live with that.

1628
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.266
Oliver. you're a great
guy and a great friend.

1629
01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:28.300
But I trust the numbers.

1630
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.433
Always have.

1631
01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.467
More than you trust
your own heart?

1632
01:09:34.834 --> 01:09:37.834
My head and my heart
trust the numbers.

1633
01:09:37.967 --> 01:09:40.934
So what are you saying.
you just don't like me?

1634
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.133
I do like you.

1635
01:09:45.133 --> 01:09:46.767
As more than a friend?

1636
01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:54.867
(melancholy music)

1637
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.133
I just don't even think
you believe that.

1638
01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:01.300
I'm really sorry if
I hurt your feelings.

1639
01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:06.233
Zoe. I know it's really
hard to be vulnerable.

1640
01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:09.567
but I like you and no
algorithm or-or number

1641
01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.467
is gonna change that.

1642
01:10:15.533 --> 01:10:17.333
I don't know what
to tell you.

1643
01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:21.500
I'm really sorry.

1644
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.967

1645

1646
01:10:45.433 --> 01:10:46.734
(knocking on door)

1647
01:10:53.266 --> 01:10:54.967
How you doing?

1648
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.133
Not great. to be honest.

1649
01:10:56.266 --> 01:10:57.734
Jillian:
I got a croissant for you.

1650
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.000
Jillian:
Is this thing
actually real?

1651
01:11:07.367 --> 01:11:09.066
Yeah. you want it?

1652
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.900
(laughs) Have you
seen my thumbs?

1653
01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.066
No trace of
green anywhere.

1654
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.100
Me neither. and now it just
makes me sad looking at it.

1655
01:11:19.467 --> 01:11:20.500
Thanks. I'm not hungry.

1656
01:11:20.633 --> 01:11:22.100
I'll eat it later.

1657
01:11:23.967 --> 01:11:25.433
You want to talk about it?

1658
01:11:28.133 --> 01:11:30.934
I can't believe
DigiLove failed.

1659
01:11:34.633 --> 01:11:36.600
I can't believe I failed.

1660
01:11:38.467 --> 01:11:41.867
And now things with
Oliver and I are

1661
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.633
(sighs) definitely done.

1662
01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:47.467
Hey. look at me.

1663
01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:51.467
You didn't fail.

1664
01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:54.467
You took a risk.

1665
01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:58.200
And in the last few weeks
I have seen you grow more

1666
01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:00.367
than I have ever seen
you grow before.

1667
01:12:02.233 --> 01:12:03.700
I'm so proud of you.

1668
01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.367
Now. what are we gonna do
about this meeting tomorrow?

1669
01:12:12.934 --> 01:12:14.133
Well we're just going
to have to go in

1670
01:12:14.266 --> 01:12:16.567
and tell Ms. Lee the truth.

1671
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.667
Our compatibility
numbers are off.

1672
01:12:19.533 --> 01:12:21.734
We may never have a
chance like this again. Zo-

1673
01:12:21.867 --> 01:12:24.066
I know. but we can't lie.

1674
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.066
And we don't have
another couple lined up.

1675
01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.066
Well. I had an idea.

1676
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.066
Now keep in mind.

1677
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.734
these are desperate
circumstances.

1678
01:12:30.867 --> 01:12:31.900
If this is about Oliver-

1679
01:12:32.033 --> 01:12:33.166
Jillian:
It's not.

1680
01:12:33.867 --> 01:12:35.567
I was thinking.

1681
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.233
what if we brought
Leo and his match in?

1682
01:12:38.367 --> 01:12:41.233
I know it's not quite 90%.
but 86 is pretty close.

1683
01:12:41.367 --> 01:12:43.066
And maybe Ms. Lee
would understand.

1684
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.367
I thought about that.

1685
01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.100
but if our numbers are off.
then his numbers are off too.

1686
01:12:47.233 --> 01:12:49.433
I also thought about
that David guy. but-

1687
01:12:49.567 --> 01:12:50.767
Jillian:
Right.

1688
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.600
Didn't you say that you
two were strangely alike?

1689
01:12:52.734 --> 01:12:54.767
Like he was like your
male equivalent?

1690
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.033
Yeah. we're like
basically the same person.

1691
01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.533
Huh.

1692
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.166
What?

1693
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.767
Well. hear me out.

1694
01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:06.000
Do you think
there's a chance

1695
01:13:06.133 --> 01:13:09.100
that your compatibility with
David could actually be higher?

1696
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:14.000
What if you reached out to him
and just took the temperature.

1697
01:13:14.133 --> 01:13:16.033
now that Oliver's
out of the picture?

1698
01:13:18.233 --> 01:13:19.233
(Zoe sighs)

1699
01:13:19.367 --> 01:13:21.300
Look. obviously there's
no pressure either way.

1700
01:13:21.433 --> 01:13:22.900
I'm just brainstorming here.

1701
01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.633
(melancholy music)

1702
01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:28.900
I don't know.

1703
01:13:33.433 --> 01:13:35.233
(sighs) Might be
worth a shot.

1704
01:13:36.433 --> 01:13:38.633
I'll think about it.

1705
01:13:38.767 --> 01:13:39.900
(sighs)

1706
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.800
For DigiLove.

1707
01:13:42.934 --> 01:13:44.233
Come here.

1708
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:52.133
(gentle instrumental)

1709
01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:56.333
(upbeat music)

1710
01:13:56.467 --> 01:13:57.834
What even is the big
deal about a croissant?

1711
01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.433
It's just flour and water.

1712
01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:01.834
Ooh. almond in there.

1713
01:14:03.867 --> 01:14:05.000
Chocolate.

1714
01:14:05.867 --> 01:14:08.400
Maybe I should call Zoe.

1715
01:14:08.533 --> 01:14:09.567
tell her she was right.

1716
01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.500
you know.
about croissants.

1717
01:14:12.033 --> 01:14:13.333
One step at a time.

1718
01:14:15.633 --> 01:14:17.100
One step at a time.

1719
01:14:17.967 --> 01:14:19.767
Man. I'd really
love a croissant!

1720
01:14:21.133 --> 01:14:22.333
Okay.

1721
01:14:22.467 --> 01:14:23.767
One step at a time.

1722
01:14:25.633 --> 01:14:27.266
One step at a time.

1723
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.633
(phone chimes)

1724
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:36.867

1725
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.800
(upbeat music)

1726
01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.700
Zoe:
Sorry I didn't
message you earlier.

1727
01:14:49.834 --> 01:14:52.200
Work's been really busy.

1728
01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:53.867
No. it's all good.

1729
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.200
My mom used to say "if you
want something in life.

1730
01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:57.967
"be ready to
fight for it."

1731
01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.567
She sounds like
a smart woman.

1732
01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.066
Where do you think
I got it from?

1733
01:15:02.266 --> 01:15:03.467
So the cheese
is good here?

1734
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.300
Oh. the best.

1735
01:15:05.433 --> 01:15:06.734
Two cheese slices please.

1736
01:15:08.266 --> 01:15:10.066
Actually. can I
try the Hawaiian?

1737
01:15:11.767 --> 01:15:12.800
Pineapple on pizza?

1738
01:15:12.934 --> 01:15:14.467
Mmhmm.
-Oh.

1739
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.066
Never was a fan of that.

1740
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.500
Me neither. really.

1741
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.400
(upbeat music)

1742
01:15:21.533 --> 01:15:22.533
David:
And I said to him

1743
01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:24.066
he would never get a
deal like this again

1744
01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.500
and he signed the contract
right on the spot.

1745
01:15:29.533 --> 01:15:32.400
Speaking of contracts.
how's work going for you?

1746
01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:33.600
It's going okay.

1747
01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:35.100
We recently found out
that there's a problem

1748
01:15:35.233 --> 01:15:37.100
with our
compatibility numbers.

1749
01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:38.700
but we're working on it.

1750
01:15:39.734 --> 01:15:42.100
And that's why the app
hasn't gone fully public yet.

1751
01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:43.867
Just some bugs
to work out.

1752
01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.033
Thank you.
-
Awesome.

1753
01:15:48.066 --> 01:15:49.100
That's so funny.

1754
01:15:49.233 --> 01:15:51.600
I actually matched with
someone else at 83%.

1755
01:15:51.734 --> 01:15:54.700
but I thought to myself:
"go with the odds."

1756
01:15:56.066 --> 01:15:57.266
I would do the same.

1757
01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:04.333

David:
I told you.

1762
01:16:15.433 --> 01:16:17.300
shoulda gone
with cheese.

Cheese is safe.

1764

Cheese is good.

Better than all right.
I just had an epiphany.

Huh?

1776
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.333
You should link up
with your 83% match.

1777

Who knows what
could happen?

1780
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:08.900
Jill!

1781
01:17:09.033 --> 01:17:10.433
Hey. how'd it go with David?
Are you almost here?

1782
01:17:10.567 --> 01:17:11.934
Change of plans.

1783
01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:14.133
Can you stall the
meeting with Ms. Lee?

1784
01:17:14.266 --> 01:17:16.400
Uh. I-I can try.

1785
01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:17.900
Um. how long are
you gonna be?

1786
01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.066
A couple of minutes past.
no more than five.

1787
01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.400
(sighs) I will
do what I can.

1788
01:17:22.533 --> 01:17:23.734
Ah. you're a lifesaver!

1789
01:17:23.867 --> 01:17:26.066
Seriously. I'm taking you
out for ice cream later.

1790
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.500
Yes. you are.

1791
01:17:28.367 --> 01:17:29.667
(loud exhale)

1792
01:17:31.867 --> 01:17:37.400
(dramatic music)

1793
01:17:37.533 --> 01:17:43.066
(muted indistinct chatter)

1794
01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:50.100
(dramatic music swells)

1795
01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:52.934
♪

1796
01:17:53.066 --> 01:17:53.934
Zoe?

1797
01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:55.100
(Zoe pants)

1798
01:17:55.233 --> 01:17:56.100
What are you doing here?

1799
01:17:56.233 --> 01:17:57.600
I had to come see you.

1800
01:17:57.734 --> 01:17:59.767
How did you even
know I was here?

1801
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.333
Well. that's the funny
thing about social media.

1802
01:18:02.467 --> 01:18:03.667
When you tag your location.

1803
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.767
your followers can
tell where you are.

1804
01:18:06.967 --> 01:18:08.667
Probably shouldn't have
skipped the safety chapter

1805
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.166
when I taught you
how to use it.

1806
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.433
Oh. right.

1807
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.700
I have to tell you
something important.

1808
01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.033
Okay.

1809
01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.033
I ordered Hawaiian pizza.

1810
01:18:21.767 --> 01:18:23.133
You came all the way
here to tell me that?

1811
01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:26.800
Jillian:
And those are the Latin
roots of the word algorithm.

1812
01:18:26.934 --> 01:18:28.467
(laughs) It's fascinating.

1813
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.800
Thank you for the context.
Ms. Jones.

1814
01:18:30.934 --> 01:18:32.300
Oh. please.
call me Jillian.

1815
01:18:32.433 --> 01:18:33.967
Right. Jillian.

1816
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.967
But is your CEO planning
to join us today?

1817
01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.800
Yes. she is on her way.

1818
01:18:37.934 --> 01:18:39.800
She will be here
any minute.

1819
01:18:39.934 --> 01:18:41.800
Ms. Lee:
I don't tolerate tardiness.

1820
01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:43.066
Where is she?

1821
01:18:43.767 --> 01:18:47.300
(sighs) Well. um. the truth
is she's running late

1822
01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:48.967
because she had
something very important

1823
01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.467
to do on her way here.

1824
01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.633
More important
than this meeting?

1825
01:18:51.767 --> 01:18:52.800
No. it's not that exactly-

1826
01:18:52.934 --> 01:18:54.400
Ms. Lee:
Then we'll have
to reschedule.

1827
01:18:54.967 --> 01:18:56.333
I may have moved
our meeting up

1828
01:18:56.467 --> 01:18:58.333
but you should have told
me you weren't ready.

1829
01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:00.400
We could have met after
my return from Shanghai

1830
01:19:00.533 --> 01:19:02.500
instead of wasting
each other's time.

1831
01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.233
Okay. I'm gonna just.
I'm gonna.

1832
01:19:05.367 --> 01:19:06.734
I'm gonna just try
her one more time.

1833
01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:08.900
I'm sure that her
approach is imminent.

1834
01:19:09.033 --> 01:19:10.500
(keyboard clicks)

1835
01:19:11.033 --> 01:19:13.400
I came here to tell you
that I'm the kind of person

1836
01:19:13.533 --> 01:19:16.667
that orders vanilla ice cream
and cheese pizza.

1837
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.767
so meeting you has really
shaken things up for me.

1838
01:19:21.633 --> 01:19:26.700
And the real reason I wanted
to spend so much time with you

1839
01:19:26.834 --> 01:19:29.300
wasn't to research why
the numbers were wrong.

1840
01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.633
It's because I was having
so much fun with you.

1841
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.300
And I don't care about
the numbers anymore.

1842
01:19:41.166 --> 01:19:42.967
I want to be with you.

1843
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.967
I want to be with you.

1844
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.533
(romantic music)

1845
01:19:57.667 --> 01:19:59.133
So you're the
happy couple.

1846
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.900
Ms. Lee. I'm so
sorry I'm late.

1847
01:20:03.033 --> 01:20:05.734
I told your colleague I
don't tolerate tardiness.

1848
01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.900
unless there's a
really good reason.

1849
01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:09.166
Care to explain?

1850
01:20:10.033 --> 01:20:11.166
Jillian: Ms. Lee!

1851
01:20:13.533 --> 01:20:16.900
(pants) Ms. Lee. Ms. Lee.
I geo-tracked Zoe

1852
01:20:17.033 --> 01:20:21.166
and she should be.
oh. hi Zoe. everyone.

1853
01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:23.900
I can give you the
full picture if you want.

1854
01:20:24.033 --> 01:20:26.233
I think you should at
this point. don't you?

1855
01:20:26.367 --> 01:20:27.900
The truth is.

1856
01:20:28.033 --> 01:20:31.066
Oliver and I
matched at 98%.

1857
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.600
but we're very different.

1858
01:20:33.734 --> 01:20:37.767
We're polar opposites.
really. but hi. Ms. Lee.

1859
01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.767
Zoe:
And a couple
of weeks ago.

1860
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:40.934
while we were getting
to know each other-

1861
01:20:41.066 --> 01:20:42.400
(phone chimes)

1862
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.867
Zoe:
We realized that there was a
very small error in our coding.

1863
01:20:46.233 --> 01:20:48.100
Our compatibility
numbers are off.

1864
01:20:48.233 --> 01:20:49.100
Your numbers are off?

1865
01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:50.100
By how much?

1866
01:20:50.233 --> 01:20:51.367
Zoe:
Well that's the thing-

1867
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.934
Jillian:
We. uh. only very
recently discovered

1868
01:20:54.066 --> 01:20:57.266
that our code has been
rounding down instead of up.

1869
01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.767
So the percentages are
decimally off. if at all.

1870
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.000
Jill. what are you?

1871
01:21:01.133 --> 01:21:02.166
What does that mean?

1872
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.266
You two aren't
98% compatible.

1873
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.033
You're 99% compatible.

1874
01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:15.633
(exciting music)

1875
01:21:15.767 --> 01:21:17.300
Ms. Lee. I apologize.

1876
01:21:17.433 --> 01:21:19.800
but the real
reason I was late

1877
01:21:19.934 --> 01:21:21.967
was because we had
a falling out.

1878
01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:25.133
and I had to fix things
with Oliver first.

1879
01:21:25.266 --> 01:21:26.467
Ms. Lee:
Ms. Williams.
you mean to tell me

1880
01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.300
you prioritized a
romantic relationship

1881
01:21:29.433 --> 01:21:30.734
above my investment?

1882
01:21:33.433 --> 01:21:34.800
Congratulations. DigiLove.

1883
01:21:34.934 --> 01:21:36.300
You've got an investor.

1884
01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.967
(in unison) What?

1885
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.300
I know.

1886
01:21:39.433 --> 01:21:41.667
You were late.
your pitch was messy

1887
01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.834
and I'm fairly certain
you didn't know

1888
01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:45.934
about the coding error
until moments ago.

1889
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.834
But I also have eyes.

1890
01:21:48.967 --> 01:21:50.500
And I asked that you
bring me a couple

1891
01:21:50.633 --> 01:21:52.166
to prove your app works.

1892
01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.934
And clearly it does.

1893
01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.166
Like I said.

1894
01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.000
I know love
when I see it.

1895
01:21:58.133 --> 01:22:00.400
(laughs) Thank you. Ms. Lee.
you won't regret this.

1896
01:22:00.533 --> 01:22:02.233
My assistant will
send over the papers

1897
01:22:02.367 --> 01:22:05.000
for signing while
I'm in Shanghai.

1898
01:22:06.033 --> 01:22:07.400
By the time I get back.

1899
01:22:07.533 --> 01:22:09.400
I want your app ready
for public launch.

1900
01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:10.767
Of course.

1901
01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.900
Ms. Lee:
Now if you'll excuse me.
I have a plane to catch.

1902
01:22:13.033 --> 01:22:14.333
See you in a
couple months.

1903
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.200
All right. is it finally
time for the victory dance?

1904
01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:22.200
It is finally time for
the victory dance.

I have just a small toast
I want to make. um.

1925
01:23:06.433 --> 01:23:07.300
if that's okay.

1926
01:23:07.433 --> 01:23:08.800
Firstly. I know I
don't work here.

1927
01:23:08.934 --> 01:23:11.467
but I've seen how hard
you've all been working

1928
01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.633
for the past
year and I'd say

1929
01:23:13.767 --> 01:23:15.734
congratulations are
definitely in order.

1930
01:23:15.867 --> 01:23:17.233

Yeah.

And. uh. secondly. Zoe.

1933
01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:25.266
this app is what brought us
together in the first place.

1934

1935

that I had
feelings for you.

1936
01:23:30.233 --> 01:23:33.433

that you're the one.
