Your future mountain abode.

10
00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:49.196
Fit for a king or a pair of
queens. as I should say.

00:01:49.196 --> 00:01:50.110
In your case.

12
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:51.154
We could be kings.

That's how I took on my career
as a huckster of homes.

31
00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.229
That's how I took on my
marriage. and that's how I

32

took on rectifying a life that
had gone to the dogs.

they're going to be

kind of money that can afford

It's a big house. baby.

It's so big.

159

I got an appointment and
everything.

161
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:50.552
You'd be so proud.

162
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:55.731
It's so sweet.

163
00:12:58.342 --> 00:13:00.867
Babe mere inches from selling
that big house I've been

164
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:01.868

165
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.826
Oh. yeah. And now you got
this.

166
00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:06.568
Yeah. We're gonna be all

You and me.

168
00:13:08.657 --> 00:13:09.876
Okay. Okay.

169
00:13:27.545 --> 00:13:29.199
I'd say it deserves a drink.

00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:46.146
How are things with you and
Travis? Things going better?

181
00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:48.017
You're so sweet.

182
00:14:48.148 --> 00:14:49.671
We're doing great.

183
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.631
Well. you know. I'm always
there for both of you.

184
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:57.244
There's a couple blocks down.
and either you need a couch.

185
00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:02.945
Talk to you later.

186
00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:05.513
The.

187
00:15:13.216 --> 00:15:15.610
Sam's great. isn't she?

188
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.828
Love her to death.

189
00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:22.704
I just worry sometimes. that's
all.

190
00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.535
I mean. she's the best.
really.

191
00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:30.973
But the drinking. I worry.

192
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.411
I'm not saying this.

193
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:36.544
I hear it around.

194
00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:42.593
Not just for her. but how it
reflects on this office will

195
00:15:42.593 --> 00:15:43.333
be.

196
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.769
I know you're an agent.

197
00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:46.380
I'm just a lowly assistant.

198
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.122
Would you kindly knock it the
fuck off?

199
00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:53.735
I just finished a showing.

200
00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:55.432
I was talking to Brenda.

201
00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:57.739
Coming home now.

202
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.832
I know last night was rough.

203
00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:06.661
But I love you.

204
00:16:09.794 --> 00:16:12.101
I just want to meet your mama
on a Sunday.

205
00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:17.106
I make love to you all day on
a Monday.

206
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.979
I'm hanging up now.

207
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:35.995
They were clandestine
airstrikes somewhere.

208
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.606
Environmental manipulation
somewhere else.

209
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.914
A world gone mad with
ignorance.

210
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.135
Possible harbingers of a
coming apocalypse.

211
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.095
But that was all background
haze.

212
00:16:49.095 --> 00:16:52.402
Like the blue smoke I often
wheezed over

213
00:16:52.402 --> 00:16:54.013
Long summer evenings.

214
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.888
As I scratched out the
troubles of the passing.

215
00:17:03.326 --> 00:17:07.330
Lingering swirls hanging in
the air. as inconsequential

216
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.421
and disparate as the struggles
that permeated this garish

217
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:16.122
life dream. If I was grieving.
it was because I hadn't let go

218
00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:17.732
of the past.

219
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.040
The ill winds of fortune that
led me to this desolate town.

220
00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:24.260
If I was anxious. it was
because somewhere in the

221
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:29.439
depths I sensed a forlorn end
to punctuate this existence

222
00:17:29.439 --> 00:17:32.355
after the coming violence that
will have led me to it.

223
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.447
With little regard for idle
pleasures. I was doomed to

224
00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:39.406
play the villain's part.

225
00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:45.151
Here I am. a rail town amongst
the vulgar and profane.

226
00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:47.675
In the depths of hell.

227
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.809
Can I help you?

228
00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:37.377
Oh. ma'am. I'm afraid there's
no hope for that.

229
00:18:37.377 --> 00:18:38.900
I'm a fallen soul.

230
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.944
Oh.

231
00:18:39.944 --> 00:18:43.122
Well. Well. what may I do for
you?

232
00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:47.996
Well. what can you tell me
about Sam lives over there.

233
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:52.696
Ah. well. she works a lot. but
she's always down for a good

234
00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:54.742
time. Good time. Sammy.

235
00:18:54.742 --> 00:18:59.138
That's her. Also. she has a
deadbeat husband.

236
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.271
Well. they're both drunks and
they fight a lot.

237
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.058
Do you mean physical?

238
00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:11.280
Oh. sometimes I don't know.

239
00:19:11.846 --> 00:19:15.589
I hear a lot of banging going
on in there. and I ain't just

240
00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:18.026
talking about the usual kind
of banging.

241
00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:24.250
You know what that is. don't
you. mister?

242
00:19:24.337 --> 00:19:26.121
Well. I think I remember that.

243
00:19:31.126 --> 00:19:35.609
I meant. More like physical
violence.

244
00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:40.179
No. I never seen no bruises.

245
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.572
I mean. no. sorry. not a one.

246
00:19:45.314 --> 00:19:48.404
What did you say a deadbeat
does?

247
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:52.713
I didn't. and he doesn't.

248
00:19:53.148 --> 00:19:56.499
Doesn't do anything.

249
00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:58.109
Oh.

250
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:02.505
You know. he's probably drunk
in there right now.

251
00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:03.767
If you want to go see him.

252
00:20:03.854 --> 00:20:04.681
Oh. no. I don't

253
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:06.205
Want to go see him.

254
00:20:07.554 --> 00:20:10.905
But I'm actually in the market
for a house of my own in the

255
00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:15.214
region here. What you've done
with your place. I mean. these

256
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.259
flower beds are lovely.

257
00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:23.787
Um. you know what? I have to
go back inside and fix dinner

258
00:20:23.787 --> 00:20:27.487
for herb. I'm really sorry
about that. sir.

259
00:20:27.922 --> 00:20:29.793
It was nice to meet you.

260
00:20:30.403 --> 00:20:32.666
I hope I was of some help.

261
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:35.843
Well. as I told you. there's
no hope for me.

262
00:20:36.757 --> 00:20:37.192
I.

263
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.151
By Mr.

264
00:20:41.457 --> 00:20:44.286
Tata. For now.

265
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.832
Yeah.

266
00:21:44.477 --> 00:21:47.697
Cool. Can we be friends after
the sale. like the three of

267
00:21:47.697 --> 00:21:48.394
us?

268
00:21:48.394 --> 00:21:49.438
Oh. that would be sweet.

269
00:21:49.438 --> 00:21:50.874
I would love that.

270
00:21:50.874 --> 00:21:53.094
Well. you both have my
personal cell and email. so by

271
00:21:53.094 --> 00:21:56.706
all means. Oh. no.

272
00:21:57.533 --> 00:21:58.926
Uh. Uh. Marlene.

273
00:21:58.926 --> 00:22:02.408
Was it? Marlene. I'm
incredibly busy with clients

274
00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:04.584
at the moment. but I'd be more
than happy to talk with you

275
00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:05.280
after.

276
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.716
Are you the neighbor?

277
00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:10.807
There's a special energy here
that needs preserving.

278
00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:12.287
Marlene.

279
00:22:12.287 --> 00:22:14.811
Some say we have a special
energy. don't they? They do.

280
00:22:14.942 --> 00:22:17.945
This area is changing. and not
for the better.

281
00:22:17.945 --> 00:22:20.469
I know what type you two are.

282
00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:23.298
I'm going inside.

283
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.213
Molly.

284
00:22:25.213 --> 00:22:26.606
Can we discuss this after?

285
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:28.390
It's a slippery slope.

286
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.611
You know. the way a place
changes. the energy gets

287
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:35.310
destroyed. One materialist
couple from the city at a

288
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.311
time.

289
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.489
Jerry. can I see you for a
moment?

290
00:22:41.272 --> 00:22:42.883
Yeah. Sure thing.

291
00:22:42.883 --> 00:22:46.016
For the record. I have nothing
against the fact that you were

292
00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:48.018
both women. It's just that.
Marlon.

293
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.978
I've been incredibly patient
with you up until this point.

294
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.588
Let's not escalate here.

295
00:22:52.588 --> 00:22:53.546
Patient?

296
00:22:53.937 --> 00:22:55.939
This is not your home.

297
00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:58.681
It is I who is patient with
you.

298
00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:00.335
Oh.

299
00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:02.206
Well. there you have it.

300
00:23:02.206 --> 00:23:04.383
It's a lovely home. but she
comes with it.

301
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.689
You and Darla will just have
to factor that into your

302
00:23:06.689 --> 00:23:08.343
decision making process.

303
00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:10.780
I appreciate your honesty.
Sam.

304
00:23:11.215 --> 00:23:12.478
Oh.

305
00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:13.870
No one's ever said that to me
in all my life.

306
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:17.570
I smell gas inside the house.

307
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.311
The house smells like gas.

308
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:22.662
Ah.

309
00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:24.751
This cabin is leaking gas
heavily.

310
00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:26.753
I'm sure it's not.

311
00:23:26.753 --> 00:23:27.536
No. It is.

312
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:30.974
I smell it.

313
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.933
This room is filled with gas.

314
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.807
Your husband is looking for
you.

315
00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:41.463
That means perfectly fine at
home.

316
00:23:43.552 --> 00:23:44.858
Are you sure about that?

317
00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:49.732
Who are you?

318
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.299
I'm interested in the house.

319
00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:52.213
How much?

320
00:23:52.692 --> 00:23:54.084
Jenny wants our house?

321
00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:55.608
Yeah. How much?

322
00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.090
I'm afraid these women have
already entered negotiations

323
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.178
on a deal.

324
00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:03.180
Which means the deal isn't
done yet.

325
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.791
Right. And I got cash.

326
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:06.880
Anyone mind if I smoke?

327
00:24:11.885 --> 00:24:13.800
No. You know what? I've been
trying to quit.

328
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.847
Cigarettes are killers that
travel in packs.

329
00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:24.898
Remember. your husband is
looking for you.

330
00:24:25.594 --> 00:24:27.291
Have a nice day. y'all.

331
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.819
I'll be damned.

332
00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:34.516
The audacity.

333
00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:38.999
Now. I really. really want you
both to have the house putting

334
00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:41.262
that out there in the
universe.

335
00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:46.136
That man was evil.

336
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.930
Does Travis know about your
husband?

337
00:25:04.415 --> 00:25:05.591
Ma'am.

338
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:10.944
Travis is my husband.

339
00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:19.909
Ma'am. this line needs to
move.

340
00:25:20.257 --> 00:25:24.218
Hey. lady. Whew.

341
00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:27.003
I'm so sorry.

342
00:25:29.963 --> 00:25:31.747
Does Travis know about
Madeleine?

343
00:25:41.017 --> 00:25:41.888
Keep the change.

344
00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:44.499
Do not follow me.

345
00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:39.380
Yeah.

346
00:26:44.124 --> 00:26:45.778
Hear my words when I'm
speaking.

347
00:26:45.778 --> 00:26:47.780
Move the crypto down.

348
00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:50.260
Let our surrogates in the
press frame it.

349
00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.348
Move it down.

350
00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:54.787
Know that that is another
topic.

351
00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:58.051
Again. I repeat. that is
another topic.

352
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:01.358
As you know. I do not discuss
biotech on this line.

353
00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:07.974
I think I'm not aware of that.

354
00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:11.499
There are degrees of security.
the replication tech in

355
00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:13.762
particular. I do not discuss.
you know. this.

356
00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:17.070
I got to go.

357
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.255
I found her.

358
00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:29.386
She's here.

359
00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:40.049
The past won't let me go.

360
00:27:40.397 --> 00:27:43.139
All those hateful things haunt
me.

361
00:27:44.184 --> 00:27:46.839
Evil. Rotten to the core.

362
00:27:48.057 --> 00:27:49.406
A fallen woman.

363
00:27:50.407 --> 00:27:52.322
And living inside of a lie.

364
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:56.283
If I died. the world would
just go on.

365
00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:00.853
All my greatest fears.

366
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.203
Already come true.

367
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.335
So be it.

368
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:11.690
Oh. there she is.

369
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:13.779
You okay. sunshine?

370
00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:17.783
Just some bad dreams

371
00:28:18.435 --> 00:28:22.135
Again. huh? Oh. God.

372
00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:25.094
Careful there.

373
00:28:25.573 --> 00:28:27.096
As always.

374
00:28:28.271 --> 00:28:31.927
Hey. uh. I'm gonna go hop in
the shower right and left your

375
00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:33.276
breakfast on the table.

376
00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:05.961
You're standing in my
neighbor's house.

377
00:29:06.222 --> 00:29:07.484
I bought it.

378
00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:09.008
The house.

379
00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:10.661
The whole thing.

380
00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:13.795
Without my knowing about it.

381
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:15.797
Right across the street from
where I live.

382
00:29:16.232 --> 00:29:18.321
Details I want details.

383
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:19.061
Come on now.

384
00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:20.236
Give them up.

385
00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:22.978
Details. details. Why fish for
the devil.

386
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:27.200
Now. what about it?

387
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.331
What of what?

388
00:29:28.331 --> 00:29:29.898
Your husband.

389
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:34.947
My husband. Travis. is having
a nice. relaxing. hot shower.

390
00:29:34.947 --> 00:29:38.777
And that house that you just
watched me walk out of there.

391
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:39.778
Satisfied?

392
00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:43.216
Um. no.

393
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.177
I'll call the police.

394
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:51.790
Oh. I think we both know that
involving the police isn't in

395
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.748
your best interest. is it?

396
00:29:56.707 --> 00:29:57.708
Who are you?

397
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:02.583
Shall we discuss? Madeline?
Sam.

398
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:05.760
I don't know what you mean.

399
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.896
It's all coming back. isn't
it?

400
00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:15.639
What's your relation to what
you're.

401
00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:17.903
Alluding to.

402
00:30:19.556 --> 00:30:22.559
Well. let's just say that you
have a very powerful adversary

403
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.996
out there somewhere.

404
00:30:25.911 --> 00:30:29.436
Very powerful adversary
indeed.

405
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:55.941
You know the question I must
have answered Peter.

406
00:30:56.855 --> 00:31:00.423
Before I give the command
before the Blitz.

407
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.860
That's right. Peter.

408
00:31:02.121 --> 00:31:04.514
I do know the question that
haunts you. Mr. Locke.

409
00:31:04.514 --> 00:31:06.255
I have a lead on that.

410
00:31:06.342 --> 00:31:08.867
Her friend. local woman named
Brenda.

411
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.218
The closest thing she has to a
confidant in this whistle

412
00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:14.785
stop. It's wonderful.

413
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:17.397
I await your next dispatch.

414
00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:22.576
The start of spring.

415
00:31:29.235 --> 00:31:32.064
Oh. baby. that's not a thing.

416
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:34.893
Are you with that?

417
00:32:10.189 --> 00:32:15.107
I used to think that life
could be so.

418
00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:19.633
Oh. predictable. I kept

419
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:24.899
My heart in a cage and was so

420
00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:26.422
Unreachable.

421
00:32:26.553 --> 00:32:33.255
But then you came along and
turned dark into light.

422
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:36.128
I was cruel to those whose
secrets are exposed.

423
00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:42.786
Right. You set my heart on
fire and often fly.

424
00:32:43.613 --> 00:32:51.665
I used to think that love
could be so damned ridiculous.

425
00:32:51.665 --> 00:33:00.021
I kept my stiff upper lip and
was so meticulous.

426
00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:06.810
But then you came along and
you showed me the way.

427
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.337
You turned the long. cold
night into a brand new.

428
00:33:11.337 --> 00:33:13.121
bright. shiny day.

429
00:33:14.905 --> 00:33:16.907
Well be no great.

430
00:33:17.386 --> 00:33:22.217
Skies. Only blue sky.

431
00:33:22.478 --> 00:33:25.829
Highs and deep in your.

432
00:33:28.484 --> 00:33:33.054
I'll see the sun shine
brightly on a brand new day.

433
00:33:33.489 --> 00:33:35.274
Now life is

434
00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:38.973
So adventurous I know.

435
00:33:38.973 --> 00:33:41.932
True love is meant for us.

436
00:33:41.932 --> 00:33:43.151
I'm so

437
00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:45.197
Darn glad. Hey. what'd I miss?

438
00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:49.723
Nothing. Some idiot just
jumped on the pool table.

439
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:52.160
Dark. cold night.

440
00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:56.208
You turned the dark. cold
night.

441
00:33:57.644 --> 00:34:01.387
You turned the dark. cold
night into a brand new.

442
00:34:01.387 --> 00:34:02.475
bright. shiny day.

443
00:34:02.823 --> 00:34:07.219
Every bright. shiny day.

444
00:34:08.133 --> 00:34:10.918
He bright. shiny day.

445
00:34:15.227 --> 00:34:18.099
How do.

446
00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:30.155
Uh. my my friends and I are
heading to a table in the

447
00:34:30.155 --> 00:34:31.243
back. If you.

448
00:34:31.243 --> 00:34:32.287
If you want to come.

449
00:34:32.635 --> 00:34:33.723
Oh. maybe some other time.

450
00:34:33.723 --> 00:34:34.333
Perhaps.

451
00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:35.334
Okay.

452
00:34:39.686 --> 00:34:41.557
Uh. that was quite a
performance.

453
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.604
What can I do you for?

454
00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.693
Scotch mist on the rocks.

455
00:34:47.302 --> 00:34:48.086
Coming right up.

456
00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:56.398
Chelsea. There you go.

457
00:34:56.703 --> 00:34:58.008
Thank you. Welcome.

458
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:07.409
Well. you are just the lamb.

459
00:35:07.714 --> 00:35:10.108
This lion was hoping to meet.

460
00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:13.676
I never saw someone command a
room like that.

461
00:35:13.763 --> 00:35:15.809
I was just blowing off a
little steam.

462
00:35:18.507 --> 00:35:19.334
You want something?

463
00:35:20.553 --> 00:35:21.467
Just you.

464
00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:25.427
Oh. you don't mince your
words.

465
00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:28.735
I don't mince actions either.

466
00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:34.001
If you prefer to retire.

467
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:39.615
To more private quarters.

468
00:35:41.313 --> 00:35:50.583
The lovely. Well. since we are
talking so directly. how about

469
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:57.198
this? Sir. you and I have a
couple of drinks. and if you

470
00:35:57.198 --> 00:35:59.679
give me a nudge.

471
00:36:02.725 --> 00:36:04.510
I'll be happy to retire with
you.

472
00:36:04.597 --> 00:36:06.555
Hell. I'd retire to Florida
with you.

473
00:36:06.555 --> 00:36:12.474
Oh. How's that sound? I'm all
for it.

474
00:36:12.474 --> 00:36:13.649
Mr..

475
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:17.697
Peter.

476
00:36:22.702 --> 00:36:27.315
Oh. baby. I still can't
believe you bought this house.

477
00:36:27.315 --> 00:36:29.056
Furnished no less.

478
00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:30.927
Oh. and how it's furnished.

479
00:36:30.927 --> 00:36:35.410
Have you met my nephew? You
see. I happen to believe in

480
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.847
taking things to their logical
extreme.

481
00:36:40.372 --> 00:36:43.897
Oh. I saw a vacation rental.
which does not suffice.

482
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.513
Oh. believe me. this

483
00:36:51.513 --> 00:36:54.081
Will be the talk of the real
estate world up here.

484
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:56.388
You fascinating man.

485
00:36:56.388 --> 00:37:00.870
You my girlfriend? Sam lives
right across the street.

486
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.785
Oh. Does she? My new neighbor.

487
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:04.700
You want a shot? Hmm.

488
00:37:04.787 --> 00:37:05.875
Do tell me about her.

489
00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:08.313
Oh. we work together.

490
00:37:08.313 --> 00:37:09.923
Oh. in. uh. real estate.

491
00:37:09.923 --> 00:37:11.403
Right?

492
00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:15.015
That's right. Now. can we
dispense with the small talk?

493
00:37:15.015 --> 00:37:16.712
I work in real estate.

494
00:37:16.973 --> 00:37:19.889
Enjoy pina coladas and long
walks on the beach there.

495
00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:20.847
We're all caught up.

496
00:37:21.064 --> 00:37:26.156
Whoa! Ah! What makes you tick?

497
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:32.119
Well. I run on controlled
substances and inappropriate

498
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:33.251
thoughts.

499
00:37:36.515 --> 00:37:38.473
So tell me how you want it.

500
00:37:41.868 --> 00:37:45.306
You treat me like a queen.

501
00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:47.787
And I'll treat you like a
king.

502
00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:51.834
You treat me like some game.

503
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:54.881
And I will show you how it's
played.

504
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:55.969
Oh.

505
00:37:56.143 --> 00:37:58.667
Would you stop talking like an
idiot?

506
00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:00.103
Of course I talk like an
idiot.

507
00:38:00.103 --> 00:38:01.844
How else could you understand
me?

508
00:38:01.844 --> 00:38:04.194
Oh. go to hell. woman.

509
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:06.762
Oh. honey. where do you think
I came from?

510
00:38:06.762 --> 00:38:09.156
Oh. I see you only leave me
with two options.

511
00:38:09.156 --> 00:38:10.636
Is that it? Yeah.

512
00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:13.421
Well. I had to stop and. you
know. wait for the storm to

513
00:38:13.421 --> 00:38:17.295
pass. Or I grab an umbrella
and I dance in the rain.

514
00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:18.513
Well. I

515
00:38:18.513 --> 00:38:20.080
Think you better grab yourself
an umbrella.

516
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.475
Yeah. There's always a wild
side behind an innocent face.

517
00:38:23.562 --> 00:38:28.218
You know how I explained that
in the beginning. God created

518
00:38:28.218 --> 00:38:31.483
man. But then God had a better
idea.

519
00:38:31.483 --> 00:38:35.269
Oh. so you want a God's good
girls. or do you have naughty

520
00:38:35.269 --> 00:38:36.792
thoughts?

521
00:38:36.792 --> 00:38:39.317
Oh. please. A good girl with
naughty thoughts is still just

522
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:40.753
a good girl.

523
00:38:40.927 --> 00:38:44.713
A woman was naughty thoughts
knows just what to do with

524
00:38:44.713 --> 00:38:46.280
them.

525
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.717
Oh. and tell me some of your
naughty thoughts I scratch and

526
00:38:48.717 --> 00:38:51.720
I fight I'll make you crawl
and beg.

527
00:38:52.634 --> 00:38:53.461
We need

528
00:38:53.461 --> 00:38:56.638
You. The bite of your teeth.

529
00:38:59.424 --> 00:39:02.252
My mind. The things you say to
this man.

530
00:39:02.601 --> 00:39:04.342
Well. my mother's always been.

531
00:39:04.994 --> 00:39:08.781
Be just as picky with your man
as you are with your selfies.

532
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.913
God. do you ever stop?

533
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.526
I should have been born with a
warning label.

534
00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:18.181
I guess you don't know.

535
00:39:18.181 --> 00:39:21.707
See. I should be getting
fucked to sleep right now.

536
00:39:21.707 --> 00:39:25.667
But instead I'm lying here
with you on top of me talking.

537
00:39:25.754 --> 00:39:27.060
How old are you. by the way?

538
00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:29.105
58. Going on 16.

539
00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:31.020
Um. That's what I thought.

540
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:39.333
This is the moment when.

541
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:44.251
You hold my hands over my
head.

542
00:39:45.948 --> 00:39:47.210
Pin them down.

543
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:50.388
Look me in the eye.

544
00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:55.610
And then slowly. slowly slide
inside.

545
00:40:01.137 --> 00:40:03.183
What you doing there. Sam?

546
00:40:08.841 --> 00:40:11.321
Just sorting out some HOA
docs.

547
00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:13.367
Why do you ask?

548
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:16.979
I'm just making sure you're
doing okay.

549
00:40:20.113 --> 00:40:21.767
I'm doing great. Willoughby.

550
00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:23.333
How are you doing?

551
00:40:24.378 --> 00:40:25.727
I'm good.

552
00:40:27.468 --> 00:40:30.340
Good. Glad we had this
discussion.

553
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.647
Now back to work.

554
00:40:33.126 --> 00:40:34.257
Good call.

555
00:40:36.651 --> 00:40:39.698
You know. I can always smell
it on you.

556
00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:44.485
Always. No matter the time of
day.

557
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.229
Excuse me.

558
00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:53.189
I'm talking about your
drinking. Sam.

559
00:40:53.799 --> 00:40:56.236
Everybody knows you really
ought to get that under

560
00:40:56.236 --> 00:41:01.894
control. You're an alcoholic.

561
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.985
I'm saying this as a friend
and coworker.

562
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.685
I'm an.

563
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.913
Well. that's a strong
accusation. Willoughby.

564
00:41:21.174 --> 00:41:23.611
Not too professional a thing
to say to a co-worker.

565
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:25.874
This isn't a personal attack.

566
00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:28.224
I'm just saying I can smell it
on you. is all.

567
00:41:28.224 --> 00:41:29.791
And there's concern.

568
00:41:29.878 --> 00:41:31.401
More than just me.

569
00:41:31.706 --> 00:41:35.884
Well. Willoughby. fat boy. I'm
a bit concerned about your

570
00:41:35.884 --> 00:41:37.407
relationship with Twinkies.

571
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.453
Diabetes is no laughing
matter.

572
00:41:39.714 --> 00:41:42.500
I say this from a place of
concern.

573
00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:45.024
My relationship with Twinkies.

574
00:41:45.241 --> 00:41:46.895
Nice diversion. Sam.

575
00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:48.375
You're drunk.

576
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.031
And by the way. large man.
stop talking to Brenda about

577
00:41:52.031 --> 00:41:55.121
me. Yes. I know all about
that.

578
00:41:58.646 --> 00:42:00.518
I'm the fucking alcoholic.

579
00:42:00.648 --> 00:42:02.084
What the fuck

580
00:42:02.084 --> 00:42:03.695
Are you talking about.
Willoughby? You have a goddamn

581
00:42:03.695 --> 00:42:06.045
clue. Just out of nowhere. you
start prying into my personal

582
00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:09.048
doings. You fucking hear what
I'm saying to you. you low

583
00:42:09.048 --> 00:42:10.571
level Twinkie breathing
dipstick?

584
00:42:10.571 --> 00:42:11.398
Okay. you're

585
00:42:11.398 --> 00:42:12.617
Getting unhinged here.

586
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:14.923
I wasn't accusing you of
anything.

587
00:42:14.923 --> 00:42:16.272
Well. what the

588
00:42:16.272 --> 00:42:17.404
Fuck were you doing then.
Willoughby? Giving me

589
00:42:17.404 --> 00:42:19.014
compliments. you limp dick
butterball?

590
00:42:21.234 --> 00:42:25.673
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

591
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.242
Next time you come at me with
a fucking attitude. you best

592
00:42:29.242 --> 00:42:31.810
get yourself in shape first.
you understand? Because I'm

593
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.464
liable to kick your flabby ass
over some shit like this.

594
00:42:34.464 --> 00:42:35.248
Got it?

595
00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:25.227
Who?

596
00:44:54.256 --> 00:44:57.869
Dear sir. your former wife can
be found at the following

597
00:44:57.869 --> 00:45:01.089
coordinates. Surely you've
been curious where she went.

598
00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:03.962
Your presence is expected at
said coordinates. and

599
00:45:03.962 --> 00:45:06.791
precisely two days. arriving
no later than 2 p.m..

600
00:45:09.228 --> 00:45:12.405
Failure to arrive in time will
result in her termination.

601
00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:17.845
For you to acknowledge this
letter. or an attempt to

602
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:20.195
involve authorities will
result in termination of your

603
00:45:20.195 --> 00:45:21.631
current wife and child.

604
00:45:25.287 --> 00:45:27.115
We look forward to seeing you
soon.

605
00:45:27.115 --> 00:45:28.900
Sincerely. friends.

606
00:45:32.686 --> 00:45:33.643
Everything okay?

607
00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:34.906
Uh. yes.

608
00:45:34.906 --> 00:45:35.863
Absolutely.

609
00:45:41.782 --> 00:45:43.262
You look concerned.

610
00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:46.918
Just some from the tax guys.

611
00:45:57.363 --> 00:45:59.278
Is it bad that the taxing.

612
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:01.671
Nothing to worry about. babe.

613
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:03.151
I'll handle it.

614
00:46:03.456 --> 00:46:05.371
I'm gonna go take care of some
emails while you finish.

615
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:06.894
Okay.

616
00:47:10.566 --> 00:47:13.743
What the hell happened? Where
did you go.

617
00:47:14.048 --> 00:47:15.006
Sam?

618
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:17.138
I used to live across from
you.

619
00:47:17.138 --> 00:47:19.488
I mean. you used to live
across from me.

620
00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:21.534
Another strange. fucked up man
lives there.

621
00:47:21.795 --> 00:47:23.014
Drives a black sedan.

622
00:47:23.188 --> 00:47:25.146
Yeah. I did sell it.

623
00:47:25.277 --> 00:47:26.495
Man. Gotta live.

624
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.541
And it was a generous offer.

625
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.412
Twice what it's worth.

626
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.633
The catch was I had to move
immediately.

627
00:47:33.633 --> 00:47:38.594
And so I'm stuck at this hotel
until I can find a place.

628
00:47:40.509 --> 00:47:41.554
Where's this fucking guy?

629
00:47:42.555 --> 00:47:43.512
I can't shake him.

630
00:47:48.822 --> 00:47:51.346
Oh. Sherrie. Hi.

631
00:47:51.346 --> 00:47:52.608
Nothing of concern.

632
00:47:53.435 --> 00:47:54.610
Give my best to Chuck.

633
00:47:54.915 --> 00:47:56.569
Chuck died last year.

634
00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:59.572
Oh. darling. you were too good
for him anyway.

635
00:48:12.193 --> 00:48:13.238
Move along now.

636
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.283
Move along.

637
00:48:25.163 --> 00:48:26.251
Goddamn.

638
00:48:26.729 --> 00:48:28.296
You're going fucking crazy or
what?

639
00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:40.526
Your husband just received
these.

640
00:48:44.965 --> 00:48:47.315
I have a husband. and he's
here.

641
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:52.842
AU contraire. You left your
husband just after it

642
00:48:52.842 --> 00:48:57.499
happened. didn't you. Sam?
Although Sam is just a name

643
00:48:57.499 --> 00:49:01.112
you made up when you got to
this little town. isn't it

644
00:49:01.112 --> 00:49:05.681
back then? You were called
something else.

645
00:49:12.166 --> 00:49:12.819
Lydia.

646
00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:20.827
We'll meet again.

647
00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:24.396
Don't know where? Don't know.

648
00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:27.921
But I know we.

649
00:49:28.617 --> 00:49:31.751
Meet again some sunny day.

650
00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:44.024
Keep smiling through. just
like you always do.

651
00:49:44.024 --> 00:49:51.075
Tell the. Drive the dark
clouds far away.

652
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:55.253
Keep smiling through.

653
00:49:56.428 --> 00:50:00.519
Just like you always do.

654
00:50:01.302 --> 00:50:06.046
Do. Till the blue skies drive.

655
00:50:06.046 --> 00:50:08.570
The dark clouds far away.

656
00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:22.541
Thank you. Thank you.

657
00:50:29.765 --> 00:50:30.505
For.

658
00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.163
You told me it was over.

659
00:50:36.163 --> 00:50:36.990
Grant. this isn't

660
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.556
What you think.

661
00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:38.426
Not what I think.

662
00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:40.037
I saw you making out with her.

663
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:41.038
We're old friends.

664
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.604
I missed her old friends.

665
00:50:42.604 --> 00:50:44.171
How you treat old friends.

666
00:50:44.171 --> 00:50:46.304
The fuck makes you think that
this is any of your business

667
00:50:46.304 --> 00:50:48.045
anyway? You dumb fucking

668
00:50:48.132 --> 00:50:53.137
Bitch! Ah! Ah ah

669
00:50:54.094 --> 00:50:54.964
Ah ah!

670
00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:57.315
Enough!

671
00:50:57.576 --> 00:50:58.838
You're despicable. Grant.

672
00:50:58.925 --> 00:50:59.730
It's over.

673
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:02.102
Of course it's over. bitch!

674
00:52:54.606 --> 00:52:58.218
Dear Grant. what we shared was
often sweet.

675
00:52:58.479 --> 00:52:59.828
I'm leaving you.

676
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.482
I'll never be back.

677
00:53:01.482 --> 00:53:02.875
Don't look for me.

678
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:06.183
Signing off your former wife.

679
00:53:07.053 --> 00:53:08.228
Lydia.

680
00:53:19.065 --> 00:53:24.113
Anything you want to say or
convey to me.

681
00:53:28.292 --> 00:53:29.684
Got anything?

682
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.600
Because I'm all ears.

683
00:53:33.862 --> 00:53:37.431
And this is your last chance.

684
00:53:38.519 --> 00:53:39.259
Ha ha.

685
00:53:43.002 --> 00:53:44.482
Got anything?

686
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:50.314
Her name was Madeleine.

687
00:53:52.054 --> 00:53:56.276
Yes. That was her name.

688
00:54:00.759 --> 00:54:02.151
Why are you here?

689
00:54:04.719 --> 00:54:07.722
You can think of me as the
spirit of justice.

690
00:54:08.636 --> 00:54:11.248
You're going to pay for what
you've done. and I'm here to

691
00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:12.858
provide that service.

692
00:54:15.556 --> 00:54:17.384
Service to this adversary.

693
00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:18.951
You mentioned.

694
00:54:18.951 --> 00:54:21.736
Well. you just think of him as
a concerned party and we'll

695
00:54:21.736 --> 00:54:22.998
leave it at that.

696
00:54:26.088 --> 00:54:29.701
Maybe. Maybe I can make amends
in another way.

697
00:54:31.224 --> 00:54:34.009
More. Positive way.

698
00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:41.234
A conversation. anything at
all that might change the

699
00:54:41.234 --> 00:54:43.018
dynamics of the situation.

700
00:54:43.976 --> 00:54:48.372
The intended payback is
anything.

701
00:54:50.678 --> 00:54:53.072
Anything. Anything.

702
00:54:57.903 --> 00:54:59.644
I bet you would do anything.

703
00:55:08.957 --> 00:55:18.315
But no. Tell me about that
night.

704
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:33.330
It was.

705
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:37.029
An accident.

706
00:55:40.728 --> 00:55:41.512
It was raining.

707
00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:45.211
I was confused.

708
00:55:47.387 --> 00:55:48.823
It's all so confusing.

709
00:55:55.961 --> 00:56:01.532
I see. Were you high? Sam? No.

710
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.229
Were you drunk?

711
00:56:05.536 --> 00:56:06.363
No.

712
00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:09.148
You were drunk.

713
00:56:12.281 --> 00:56:14.196
Let me ask that question
again.

714
00:56:15.633 --> 00:56:18.984
Were you drunk? Lydia?

715
00:56:20.681 --> 00:56:21.639
No. I

716
00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:23.380
I I

717
00:56:23.423 --> 00:56:24.598
I I.

718
00:56:25.077 --> 00:56:25.860
I don't know.

719
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.383
You don't know.

720
00:56:27.122 --> 00:56:27.906
You're not sure.

721
00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:29.124
You can't remember.

722
00:56:29.255 --> 00:56:30.778
It was so confusing.

723
00:56:30.909 --> 00:56:33.172
You know what? You know what.
Sam? I don't know why you're

724
00:56:33.172 --> 00:56:35.522
putting such significance on
this.

725
00:56:35.827 --> 00:56:39.613
We all exist in this sort of.
you know. absurd chaos.

726
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.615
You know. the most important
thing to do.

727
00:56:41.615 --> 00:56:43.922
It's just really important
that you just try to keep a

728
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:48.056
positive attitude as you
continue to walk on this

729
00:56:48.056 --> 00:56:49.536
planet.

730
00:56:53.714 --> 00:56:57.631
And have accountability for
the things that we've done.

731
00:57:57.474 --> 00:58:05.743
Uh. Uh. Hell.

732
00:58:09.877 --> 00:58:14.447
Damn. I was hoping day would
never come.

733
00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:17.232
In the throes

734
00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:18.451
Of a passion.

735
00:58:24.675 --> 00:58:30.811
I taste him and realize I've
been starving.

736
00:58:34.772 --> 00:58:35.642
Woo!

737
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:53.268
I. Want to know more about my.

738
00:58:56.315 --> 00:58:57.403
Neighbor.

739
00:59:01.102 --> 00:59:05.019
Your neighbor. Sam.

740
00:59:05.019 --> 00:59:05.542
Oh. is

741
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:06.543
That her name?

742
00:59:09.937 --> 00:59:13.724
Sam is married in about 20
years.

743
00:59:13.724 --> 00:59:19.860
Too young. Not to mention
you're mine.

744
00:59:22.471 --> 00:59:25.344
I'm going to ask that you give
me a little more credit than

745
00:59:25.344 --> 00:59:26.127
that.

746
00:59:26.127 --> 00:59:27.651
Yeah. So what is it. then?

747
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:34.396
Well. I want to know about
your life.

748
00:59:35.223 --> 00:59:37.443
But your friendships. your
relationships.

749
00:59:37.443 --> 00:59:41.621
I mean. who do you confide in?
Does she confide in you?

750
00:59:42.317 --> 00:59:45.582
Oh. you're so inquisitive.

751
00:59:47.627 --> 00:59:49.586
Well. Sam's a dynamo.

752
00:59:49.673 --> 00:59:50.978
I love her.

753
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:55.243
And sure. we talk.

754
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.383
This is just

755
01:00:04.383 --> 01:00:07.952
One of those things. because
if I stayed and tried to

756
01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:10.432
explain. I knew I never would
have left.

757
01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:12.521
Everything is just fine to us.

758
01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:15.568
I need you to understand me on
this one.

759
01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:20.529
Here. darling. This is just
one of those things that.

760
01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:21.487
It's more than that.

761
01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:24.621
In theory.

762
01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:27.885
Coffee.

763
01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:30.583
I just have a sip of yours.

764
01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:35.719
So then do you and

765
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:38.635
Sam.

766
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:43.552
Like. have a. I don't know.
like. deep rooted

767
01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.119
Conversations.

768
01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.512
You know. about.

769
01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:50.821
I don't know. past regrets

770
01:00:50.821 --> 01:00:54.346
Or heartbreaks or that kind of
thing.

771
01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:58.742
You are so persistent on this
topic. and I really don't know

772
01:00:58.742 --> 01:00:59.525
why.

773
01:01:10.536 --> 01:01:12.277
I think it's because.

774
01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:15.933
You've started to touch my
heart.

775
01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:27.509
I'm honored.

776
01:01:39.478 --> 01:01:41.654
No. no. Sit with me for a bit
longer.

777
01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.091
Good girl. Sit.

778
01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:46.093
Bad bitches. Right.

779
01:01:47.007 --> 01:01:48.226
I should really go.

780
01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:56.364
Well. well. you're on your
way.

781
01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:58.715
Just give some thought to us
getting married the next time

782
01:01:58.715 --> 01:01:59.716
we see each other.

783
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:08.637
Oh. Speechless for once.

784
01:02:12.163 --> 01:02:14.643
Are you serious?

785
01:02:26.394 --> 01:02:29.006
Well. since you're so curious.

786
01:02:30.964 --> 01:02:36.404
SIM talks to me about her
husband. Travis.

787
01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:42.280
They fight and they fight a
lot.

788
01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:46.327
That's terrible. Hmm'hmm.

789
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:49.766
I wonder if the.

790
01:02:51.202 --> 01:02:57.904
Drinking and the fighting is
concealing some.

791
01:02:57.904 --> 01:03:01.778
What's the phrase? Yeah. like
some deep seated

792
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.953
Guilt for

793
01:03:02.953 --> 01:03:05.694
Some past action.

794
01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:08.785
Sure.

795
01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.395
I really don't know.

796
01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:13.093
She doesn't ever talk to you
about things like this.

797
01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:18.098
Well. what? Her past before
moving here?

798
01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:21.798
Correct. I'm afraid not.

799
01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:25.279
Are you sure?

800
01:03:26.585 --> 01:03:27.629
Positive.

801
01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:38.292
Now. what is this really all
about?

802
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.738
To be continued lover man.

803
01:04:45.664 --> 01:04:49.886
You have something juicy for
me. Peter? The first husband

804
01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:50.887
got the Geo chords.

805
01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.453
As per your request.

806
01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:56.414
I suspect he'll arrive in the
fun zone sometime in the next

807
01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:57.981
24 or 48 hours.

808
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:00.809
Well. that ought to work out
nicely.

809
01:05:01.636 --> 01:05:06.424
As you know. she's remarried
some small town Gomer named

810
01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:09.383
Travis. She apparently loves
him.

811
01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:13.387
I was surprised of all but the
last.

812
01:05:15.172 --> 01:05:16.869
I'm happy so far. Peter.

813
01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:18.697
Thank you

814
01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:21.526
Sir. And the questions.

815
01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:25.008
You've had the burning
question.

816
01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:27.967
The question of guilt.

817
01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:29.751
The Morse.

818
01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:35.061
Is it tearing her up?

819
01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:44.810
Or is she living a life of
wild hedonism? With no care

820
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.072
for what she did.

821
01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.469
Makes all the difference to
me. Peter.

822
01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:54.646
The friend is a dead end.

823
01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:58.084
I'm afraid I've exhausted that
lead.

824
01:05:58.084 --> 01:05:59.651
And that lead exhausted me.

825
01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:01.522
Sam revealed nothing to her.

826
01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:05.787
Can you get it from her? From
Sam?

827
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:10.314
Name a strange credulity.

828
01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:16.624
Lydia. Here's the name of
Madeleine's killer.

829
01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:20.498
Can you get it? From that.

830
01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:21.238
Lydia.

831
01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.501
I can certainly try.

832
01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:26.025
That's neither here nor there.

833
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.549
The husbands are your target.

834
01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:32.989
Yes. sir. She will.

835
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.860
We made vulnerable.

836
01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:39.169
People will know what she did.

837
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.869
She will experience loss.

838
01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:51.181
As I did when she took my
dear. sweet Madeleine.

839
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.705
I got you. sir.

840
01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.666
I feel you right here.

841
01:06:59.754 --> 01:07:01.582
Just remember one thing.

842
01:07:02.148 --> 01:07:03.062
What's that? Sir?

843
01:07:05.717 --> 01:07:06.848
Make it messy.

844
01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:07.849
Peter.

845
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:14.726
You turn that fucking shit
heap.

846
01:07:15.553 --> 01:07:20.036
They call a town upside down.

847
01:07:21.472 --> 01:07:23.082
You got me. Peter.

848
01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:25.171
I got you. sir.

849
01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:29.871
Thanks. Peter. Great work as
always.

850
01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:31.177
There's just.

851
01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:34.354
One more thing for you. sir.

852
01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:36.182
What's that? Peter?

853
01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:38.576
You're doing the right thing.

854
01:07:40.186 --> 01:07:41.796
Know that.

855
01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:46.888
You're doing the right thing.
sir. and I'm happy to be part

856
01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:47.802
of it.

857
01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.676
I'm adding a bonus of 8
million.

858
01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.070
There. Your standard rate of
50.

859
01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.900
That drop will happen in the
usual manner.

860
01:08:02.687 --> 01:08:04.080
That's very kind.

861
01:08:06.038 --> 01:08:08.606
Curious. what are your plans
after?

862
01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:10.869
One of my homes.

863
01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.654
Costa Rica. perhaps the
island.

864
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.700
I'll take some months.

865
01:08:16.918 --> 01:08:20.879
Mission. I'm signing off now.
Peter.

866
01:08:21.445 --> 01:08:22.533
Thank you sir.

867
01:08:23.838 --> 01:08:24.448
Over.

868
01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:25.927
Over and out.

869
01:08:25.927 --> 01:08:27.364
Peter.

870
01:08:31.498 --> 01:08:37.025
Is it tearing her up? Or is
she living a life of wild

871
01:08:37.025 --> 01:08:40.638
hedonism with no care for what
she did?

872
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.119
Time will tell.

873
01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:46.818
Is this an unbreakable spell?

874
01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:54.086
This isn't a dream or trance.

875
01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:57.481
It's the realest thing that.

876
01:08:57.655 --> 01:08:58.873
I can say.

877
01:09:00.614 --> 01:09:02.921
One true love.

878
01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:05.880
That's our romance.

879
01:09:07.578 --> 01:09:08.187
For you. baby.

880
01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:11.059
No time will tell.

881
01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:14.715
Is this an unbreakable spell?

882
01:09:17.849 --> 01:09:21.331
This isn't a dream or trance.

883
01:09:21.418 --> 01:09:22.114
No.

884
01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.377
It's the realest thing

885
01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:28.468
That I can say I've ever
known.

886
01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:29.382
True.

887
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.175
That's our.

888
01:10:05.592 --> 01:10:06.985
Hi.

889
01:10:08.595 --> 01:10:10.380
I see you found the side door.

890
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.250
How are you?

891
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.209
I've never been better.

892
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:17.169
I am amazed. just stunned at
my luck.

893
01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:22.305
It's like my whole life was
spent just waiting for these

894
01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:29.312
perfect moments. All my
mistakes led me here and I

895
01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:33.141
realize they weren't even
mistakes at all.

896
01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:36.710
That's sweet. Tell me about
it.

897
01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:39.583
It's just. I don't know.

898
01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.846
There's. There are no words.

899
01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:46.938
There's a kind of perfection
in the air.

900
01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:52.726
It's like the whole world just
snaps into this dream state

901
01:10:52.726 --> 01:11:00.604
and you just know it was
perfect all along.

902
01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:14.487
Brenda.

903
01:11:14.618 --> 01:11:15.793
Yeah.

904
01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:24.976
Your services are no longer
required.

905
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.763
What? I'm serious.

906
01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:32.897
It's been nice knowing you.
local lady.

907
01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:38.119
Is this supposed to be funny.
Peter?

908
01:11:38.119 --> 01:11:40.296
No. it's supposed to be
direct.

909
01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:44.778
You mean

910
01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:49.653
I do? May you live out your
remaining days in peace.

911
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:52.873
I don't believe

912
01:11:52.873 --> 01:11:54.135
It. Believe it.

913
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.403
Am I Paradise?

914
01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:04.929
Has just turned into a hell.

915
01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:09.499
Is this true? Peter? Yes.

916
01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:12.197
I don't believe it.

917
01:12:12.197 --> 01:12:13.067
Believe it.

918
01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:17.463
Oh. God. no it isn't.

919
01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:19.944
You're just joshing with me
again.

920
01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:21.598
I get it

921
01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:25.602
Now. Get the fuck out of here.
Brenda! Scram. you whore!

922
01:12:25.602 --> 01:12:29.040
Before this bark turns into a
bite.

923
01:12:29.649 --> 01:12:31.042
Youth.

924
01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:35.438
You talked about getting
married the next time we saw

925
01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:36.395
each other.

926
01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:39.572
Words have no meaning. Brenda.

927
01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:42.706
Let this be a lesson to you in
false hope.

928
01:12:42.706 --> 01:12:47.188
How dare you call me a whore?
And what about how you're

929
01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:49.147
obviously attracted to me?

930
01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:53.804
Attracted to you? You are a
trite and inconsequential

931
01:12:53.804 --> 01:12:56.763
person. vile and profane.

932
01:12:56.763 --> 01:13:01.812
Now get lost. will you? I have
things to do.

933
01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.248
I'm not kidding.

934
01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:06.904
I never want to see you again.

935
01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:09.733
How could you do this. Peter?

936
01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:10.995
Seriously? At the.

937
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.085
How can you do this?

938
01:13:26.227 --> 01:13:30.101
Are. My God.

939
01:13:36.934 --> 01:13:38.457
Goddamn. So you're.

940
01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:42.505
Going out in the.

941
01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:43.810
God.

942
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.461
Travis.

943
01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:32.903
Travis. Tomorrow's a big

944
01:14:32.903 --> 01:14:36.559
Day. Going out in the lake to
repair the dock.

945
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.995
Peter. Peter.

946
01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:26.347
There you are.

947
01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:27.261
I've been

948
01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:29.263
So upset. What the fuck

949
01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:30.221
Are you doing here?

950
01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.918
Peter. you owe me an
explanation.

951
01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:32.658
Stop it right there.

952
01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.181
I don't owe you anything.

953
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:37.402
I want you to turn around and
walk away from here before

954
01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:39.230
it's too fucking late.

955
01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:40.927
Are.

956
01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:18.443
Hey.

957
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.680
In 3.6 miles.

958
01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.421
Take exit 730 onto Dunsmuir
Avenue.

959
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.948
In 1.4 miles. turn left onto
Pine Street.

960
01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:51.998
He.

961
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.153
Turn left

962
01:17:16.153 --> 01:17:17.241
Onto Pine Street.

963
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:19.286
Then arrive at your
destination.

964
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.596
Arrived.

965
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.842
God damn it.

966
01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:40.280
Had my say six times and I've
missed.

967
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:42.021
You still up to this old man?

968
01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:44.475
Are.

969
01:20:27.561 --> 01:20:29.563
What can I do to make this all
go away?

970
01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:32.784
Tell me what you want.

971
01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.568
I want you to hurt.

972
01:20:36.396 --> 01:20:38.703
Option. Anything.

973
01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:47.494
We're to carry out the will of
the injured party.

974
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.504
Sorry. Madeline's loved one.

975
01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:02.379
Who's behind this? If you only
knew.

976
01:21:52.342 --> 01:21:53.691
Who's my adversary?

977
01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.800
Hi there. Can I help you with
something?

978
01:22:19.586 --> 01:22:22.067
Hi. My husband Travis.

979
01:22:22.154 --> 01:22:24.156
Oh. you're Travis girl.

980
01:22:24.156 --> 01:22:25.853
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

981
01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:27.116
You just missed him.

982
01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.118
He was here.

983
01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:31.947
Yeah. He's eager to get
started on the dock.

984
01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.905
I'm sure he'll do great.

985
01:24:07.955 --> 01:24:09.305
Sam.

986
01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:14.658
I'm not here to kill you.

987
01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:18.488
If I was. you'd be dead
already.

988
01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:26.887
But that Travis boy. he's a
whole different story.

989
01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:33.111
That boy is going to be dead
as a doornail by the close of

990
01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:34.721
business today.

991
01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:54.306
And there's another one I have
on my radar to take care of by

992
01:24:54.306 --> 01:24:59.659
sunset. Grant.

993
01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.298
Tell me about the past. Sam.

994
01:25:33.476 --> 01:25:35.260
Tell me everything.

995
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:39.525
First of all. let me go.

996
01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:43.442
Other set for things.

997
01:25:44.748 --> 01:25:45.575
They aren't me.

998
01:25:48.665 --> 01:25:49.318
Evil.

999
01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:51.189
Rotten to the core.

1000
01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:54.192
Woman.

1001
01:25:58.022 --> 01:25:58.849
I love this.

1002
01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:01.808
I lost. So.

1003
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:07.205
Codependent and I think inside
of a lie.

1004
01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:13.864
If I died. the world would
just go on without me.

1005
01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:15.866
Oh my God.

1006
01:26:18.216 --> 01:26:19.435
True.

1007
01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:29.009
And do you feel remorse for
what you did?

1008
01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:37.496
Your adversary wants to know
this more than anything.

1009
01:26:41.065 --> 01:26:43.676
Ah ah ah.

1010
01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:45.591
Let me explain something to
you.

1011
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:47.419
All right. Let me make it
clear.

1012
01:26:47.506 --> 01:26:48.986
I'm not supposed to kill you.

1013
01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:52.772
But if it happens. I can
easily explain it to my boss.

1014
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.571
Ha ha ha

1015
01:27:08.745 --> 01:27:11.400
Ha ha ha ha ha

1016
01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:17.101
Ha ha! How's that for a trite
and inconsequential person.

1017
01:27:17.101 --> 01:27:17.928
bitch?

1018
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.088
Huh?

1019
01:27:48.654 --> 01:27:51.048
Huh? How did you know him?

1020
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:53.442
He's been following me.

1021
01:27:55.052 --> 01:27:56.009
He wouldn't stop.

1022
01:27:57.359 --> 01:28:01.711
He was using me to get you.

1023
01:28:05.584 --> 01:28:07.194
He charmed me.

1024
01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.677
Tossing me a marriage.

1025
01:28:12.243 --> 01:28:14.637
And he turned on me like a
fucking cobra.

1026
01:28:22.906 --> 01:28:23.820
Who's this guy?

1027
01:28:24.211 --> 01:28:26.866
He's an old flame of mine.

1028
01:28:30.043 --> 01:28:33.873
All right. Well we're going to
talk about this more later.

1029
01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.573
I'll tell you everything.

1030
01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:40.924
All right.

1031
01:28:42.273 --> 01:28:45.320
Well. I got to get out of here
because I am going to throw

1032
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.585
up. I'm gonna roll them out of
here.

1033
01:28:51.238 --> 01:28:52.109
You got this.

1034
01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:56.766
Ha!

1035
01:29:03.294 --> 01:29:03.599
Ha!

1036
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.431
Ha!

1037
01:29:55.259 --> 01:29:56.695
I'm sorry about our marriage.

1038
01:29:59.829 --> 01:30:01.308
All things I did wrong.

1039
01:30:04.311 --> 01:30:05.748
Never had a chance to tell you
that.

1040
01:30:11.449 --> 01:30:12.581
I'm sorry to.

1041
01:30:18.761 --> 01:30:20.197
I did something terrible.

1042
01:30:21.633 --> 01:30:23.983
Something much worse than you
ever did against us.

1043
01:30:25.811 --> 01:30:27.422
Something I haven't
confronted.

1044
01:30:28.074 --> 01:30:29.032
All those years.

1045
01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:31.469
Until now.

1046
01:30:32.905 --> 01:30:34.646
That's what this was all about
today.

1047
01:30:37.475 --> 01:30:39.129
You don't need to apologize.

1048
01:30:40.347 --> 01:30:42.349
I never meant to drag you into
any of this.

1049
01:30:44.874 --> 01:30:46.310
All this running around and
lying.

1050
01:30:48.138 --> 01:30:49.182
We got it with me.

1051
01:30:51.141 --> 01:30:51.620
God.

1052
01:30:51.707 --> 01:30:52.534
Both of us.

1053
01:30:59.628 --> 01:31:01.412
I need to make some changes.

1054
01:31:02.892 --> 01:31:04.241
I'm not doing it right.

1055
01:31:05.024 --> 01:31:05.851
This life thing.

1056
01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:09.202
You're alive. Lydia.

1057
01:31:10.421 --> 01:31:11.683
That's all that matters.

1058
01:31:16.862 --> 01:31:17.689
I just wanted you to

1059
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:18.603
Know the truth.

1060
01:32:21.405 --> 01:32:23.668
Miles from the ground.

1061
01:32:24.626 --> 01:32:28.107
I am so happy to see the two
of you

1062
01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:30.153
Alive and well.

1063
01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:35.767
Let me get you both a drink.

1064
01:32:35.767 --> 01:32:37.377
Oh. no no no no no. thanks.

1065
01:32:37.769 --> 01:32:39.815
Good. Gave up the sauce.

1066
01:32:41.773 --> 01:32:43.122
Is that right?

1067
01:32:45.124 --> 01:32:45.821
Yeah. We did.

1068
01:32:46.865 --> 01:32:49.172
Wow. I'll drink to that.

1069
01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:57.310
Brenda? Yeah. Thank you for
setting this up.

1070
01:32:57.659 --> 01:32:59.356
Hey. Anytime. kid.

1071
01:33:00.009 --> 01:33:01.532
Jesus. I'm so nervous.

1072
01:33:02.141 --> 01:33:04.056
I don't even know if I can go
through with it.

1073
01:33:04.056 --> 01:33:05.841
It's been so long. I.

1074
01:33:05.971 --> 01:33:06.929
Sam.

1075
01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.585
You're going to be great.

1076
01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:13.413
Thank you. Brenda.

1077
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:14.501
Thanks. hon.

1078
01:33:15.546 --> 01:33:16.895
I'll go knock them dead.

1079
01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:32.824
Feel the need again.

1080
01:33:33.651 --> 01:33:36.045
Don't know where.

1081
01:33:36.349 --> 01:33:37.742
Don't know where.

1082
01:33:38.743 --> 01:33:43.052
Um. but I know we'll meet
again.

1083
01:33:43.705 --> 01:33:45.620
Some sunny day.

1084
01:33:51.495 --> 01:33:54.846
As the days turned to weeks
and the weeks turned to

1085
01:33:54.846 --> 01:34:00.591
months. Since that fateful day
he arrived in town. I find

1086
01:34:00.591 --> 01:34:05.248
myself asking. Have I atoned
at all?

1087
01:34:06.423 --> 01:34:07.990
For what I've done.

1088
01:34:09.774 --> 01:34:15.737
Humble yourselves. therefore.
under the mighty hand of God.

1089
01:34:15.737 --> 01:34:18.609
so that at the proper time.

1090
01:34:20.263 --> 01:34:22.004
He may exalt you.

1091
01:34:23.527 --> 01:34:25.877
Casting all your anxieties on
him.

1092
01:34:26.617 --> 01:34:30.752
Because. He cares for you.

1093
01:34:32.144 --> 01:34:39.412
Be sober. Be vigilant because
your adversary. the devil.

1094
01:34:39.412 --> 01:34:42.459
walks about like a roaring
lion.

1095
01:34:43.634 --> 01:34:46.506
Seeking whom he may devour.

1096
01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:51.598
And after you have suffered
for a little while.

1097
01:34:53.992 --> 01:34:56.081
The God of all grace.

1098
01:34:56.952 --> 01:35:00.607
Who has called you in his
eternal glory in Christ.

1099
01:35:02.479 --> 01:35:06.788
He himself. Will restore.

1100
01:35:07.353 --> 01:35:12.707
Confirm. Strengthen. And
establish you.

1101
01:35:14.578 --> 01:35:18.321
Greet one another with a kiss
of love.

1102
01:35:23.543 --> 01:35:24.980
Amen.

1103
01:35:26.416 --> 01:35:30.028
Authorities still have no
leads on the triple homicide

1104
01:35:30.028 --> 01:35:32.248
and mysterious explosion.

1105
01:35:32.248 --> 01:35:35.338
The Rock the truck stop hamlet
in in May.

1106
01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:39.516
That the victim seemed to be
random targets of a sniper

1107
01:35:39.516 --> 01:35:41.910
whose motivation remains
unaccounted for.

1108
01:35:43.433 --> 01:35:48.743
Bill. Bill. Bill Graves and
Cindy Cindy Cabin Cavendish

1109
01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:51.441
were both shot dead in the
parking lot of Ketch's General

1110
01:35:51.441 --> 01:35:58.143
store. Rick Hoskins Watkins. a
wealthy landowner. was later

1111
01:35:58.143 --> 01:36:00.885
found dead shot in front of
his lakeside manor.

1112
01:36:03.366 --> 01:36:05.672
An autopsy showed he was shot
the same day.

1113
01:36:07.196 --> 01:36:09.111
Authorities still have not
ruled out terrorism.

1114
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:09.807
Jesus. honey.

1115
01:36:10.677 --> 01:36:11.766
I can't believe

1116
01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:12.462
Rick was shot the

1117
01:36:12.462 --> 01:36:13.811
Same day I was there.

1118
01:36:18.207 --> 01:36:20.296
Honey. I was really looking
forward to that job.

1119
01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:25.518
Oh. hon. there'll be plenty of
other jobs.

1120
01:36:28.478 --> 01:36:31.481
Mm. Darla. Hi.

1121
01:36:31.481 --> 01:36:35.180
Hi. Sam. I wanted you to hear
it from me first.

1122
01:36:35.267 --> 01:36:39.663
We were a bit spooked by the
gas leak. but as time goes on.

1123
01:36:39.663 --> 01:36:42.361
we can't stop thinking about
the home.

1124
01:36:42.535 --> 01:36:44.450
We'd like to buy it.

1125
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:46.844
Well. Hallelujah. That's
fantastic.

1126
01:36:46.844 --> 01:36:50.195
It took some deliberation. but
we're terribly excited and

1127
01:36:50.195 --> 01:36:52.981
can't wait to be your new
neighbors in the county.

1128
01:36:52.981 --> 01:36:54.809
Darla. I'm gonna have to call
you right back.

1129
01:36:54.983 --> 01:36:56.375
Sam. is everything all.

1130
01:37:20.922 --> 01:37:26.841
I used to think that life
could be so.

1131
01:37:27.363 --> 01:37:35.675
Predictable. I kept my heart
in a cage and was so

1132
01:37:35.675 --> 01:37:42.291
unreachable. But. Then turned
on.

1133
01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:46.251
Into life turned each wrong.

1134
01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.430
You Set my heart on fire.

1135
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:53.563
And the film fly.

1136
01:37:54.303 --> 01:37:55.608
I used

1137
01:37:55.608 --> 01:38:02.441
To. That love could be so damn
ridiculous.

1138
01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:06.706
I kept my stiff upper lip and
was.

1139
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:10.972
Home and take your loss.

1140
01:38:11.102 --> 01:38:15.759
But then you came along and
you sold.

1141
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.543
Only the way.

1142
01:38:18.066 --> 01:38:22.505
You turn the long. cold night
into a brand new. bright.

1143
01:38:22.505 --> 01:38:28.859
shiny day. There'll be no grey
skies.

1144
01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:32.950
Only blue sky.

1145
01:38:33.995 --> 01:38:37.389
And deep in your eyes.

1146
01:38:39.217 --> 01:38:43.613
I'll see the sun shine
brightly on a brand new day.

1147
01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.487
Now. Life is so adventurous.

1148
01:38:48.487 --> 01:38:52.622
I know true love is meant for
us.

1149
01:38:52.622 --> 01:38:57.148
I'm so darn glad you show me
the way.

1150
01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:03.850
Here. You turn the dark. cold
night into a brand new.

1151
01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:05.896
bright. shiny day.

1152
01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:20.911
You keep me young at heart.

1153
01:39:20.911 --> 01:39:24.610
And you had me right from the
start.

1154
01:39:25.002 --> 01:39:28.223
Oh. you got me singing.

1155
01:39:29.311 --> 01:39:32.749
Skipping and jumping and
dancing.

1156
01:39:33.576 --> 01:39:38.189
I feel like I can fly with
you.

1157
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:41.540
We're shooting across the sky
from.

1158
01:39:42.411 --> 01:39:43.281
To cloud.

1159
01:39:43.716 --> 01:39:46.415
Where? Miles from the ground.

1160
01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:55.380
The roses and the daffodils
smell sweeter than ever

1161
01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:59.080
before. Late nights.

1162
01:39:59.254 --> 01:40:02.909
Lips and passion lips lead me
to.

1163
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:13.659
You keep me young at heart and
you knock me off the charts.

1164
01:40:13.659 --> 01:40:15.139
Yes. you

1165
01:40:15.139 --> 01:40:16.967
Are the only

1166
01:40:16.967 --> 01:40:17.794
One for.

1167
01:40:23.104 --> 01:40:25.323
You keep me young.

1168
01:40:35.116 --> 01:40:37.988
You keep me young at heart.

1169
01:40:39.642 --> 01:40:41.948
At me right from the start.

1170
01:40:42.253 --> 01:40:45.474
Though. You got me singing.

1171
01:40:46.649 --> 01:40:50.305
Skipping and jumping and
dancing.

1172
01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:54.961
I feel like I can fly with.

1173
01:40:56.093 --> 01:40:59.140
Shooting across that sky from
cloud.

1174
01:41:00.793 --> 01:41:03.274
Where? Miles from the ground.

1175
01:41:09.150 --> 01:41:12.849
The daffodils smell sweeter
than ever be.

1176
01:41:15.286 --> 01:41:17.332
Late night shifts.

1177
01:41:17.332 --> 01:41:19.856
Passionate lips laid me.

1178
01:41:20.422 --> 01:41:26.732
Wanting more. You keep me
young at heart.

1179
01:41:28.473 --> 01:41:30.954
Knocked me right off the
charts.

1180
01:41:30.954 --> 01:41:36.264
Yes. you. The only one for me.

1181
01:41:38.918 --> 01:41:40.137
Cause you.

1182
01:41:41.007 --> 01:41:43.662
Min-yung at.

1183
01:41:46.404 --> 01:41:48.450
Young at heart.

1184
01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.280
You keep me young at heart.
