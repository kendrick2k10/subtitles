What's wrong?

This was
her own mother's wedding.

13

Married 60 years.

14
00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.300
Think of that. 60 years.

See the lace there?

16
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.567
I'd like to incorporate that
in our dress. Don't you think?

17
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.133
Mm-hmm. She is going to love it.

18
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.900
You're always adding

Yeah. Someday.

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:16.400
In here.
Where I always am.

Great news.

25
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.200
The Bremmers
are adding a cocktail party

All new dresses.

Oh. Um. but isn't that
supposed to be when--

29
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.133
Rebecca:
Next week.

30
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.800
We're just going to have to
roll up our sleeves

31
00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.333
and work a little overtime.

32
00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:39.700
Um. Rebecca. I promised that
I would give them some time off.

33
00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.600
Oh. I'm sorry. But the Bremmers
are one of my biggest clients.

34
00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:44.567
The paparazzi will be there.

35
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.233
This could be another cover.

36
00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:49.467
Uh. I know. It's just we. um--

37
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.133

I promise.

Tinkering again?

Oh. yes. Um.

41
00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.967
Rebecca. I thought on this dress
if we rounded

42
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:02.600
the bottom up more towards
the knees in this dress.

43
00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:03.834
it would actually--

44
00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:06.433
- Help?
- Help.

45
00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:07.667
Smooth out the curves.

46
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.967
Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.700
Good idea. Yes. I like it.
Nice.

That's Mrs. Bremmer.

50
00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:18.533
Keep at it.

51
00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.166
Heidi. darling.

52
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.633
Mrs. Bremmer: Rebecca. darling.
Thank you so much.

53
00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.100
I know it's late notice.

54
00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:24.500
but we can't be caught
in the same dresses.

55
00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:27.367
Rebecca:
Not a problem at all.

56
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500
In fact. I made a slight change
to your dress.

57
00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:35.200
Very subtle. but it'll
curb the curves just a little.

58
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:36.867
if you know what I mean.

59
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.133
Mrs. Bremmer:
You're a genius. Rebecca.

60
00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:39.367
(laughing)

61
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.300
Yeah. Genius.

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:43.867
(chuckling)

63
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.533
How long are you going to
keep covering for her?

64
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:58.934
I am not covering for her. Reg.
I'm just doing my job.

65
00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:02.533
No. you're doing her job.
They're your designs. Cindy.

66
00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.500
You should start
getting credit for them.

67
00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:06.066
I know. You know.
it's always been my dream

68
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.433
to have my own design line.

69
00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:09.800
Yeah? Well. you are the wizard
behind the curtain.

70
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.000
Rebecca promised that she'd
help me start my own brand.

71
00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:17.000
It just has to be
the right timing.

72
00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:18.867
It's never going to be
the right timing.

73
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.567
'cause without you she's done.

74
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.700
You know. she's going to dangle
that carrot forever.

75
00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.066
No. I'm not going to let
that happen.

76
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200
And besides. Rebecca.
she toiled herself for years.

77
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.867
and she is a genius
when it comes to business.

78
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.934
And you are a genius
at designing dresses.

79
00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.734
They should be your own.

80
00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:35.000
They will be. someday.

81
00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.700
Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.400
Reporter: And some fun news
in this morning.

83
00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:42.367
This year's
Hamilton Charity Ball

84
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.567
is going to be held right here
in Philadelphia.

85
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.734
at the Hamiltons' historic
Chestnut Hill Estate.

86
00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:51.533
America's largest and most
opulent private residence

87
00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:53.834
is home sweet home
for Gerald. Gloria.

88
00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.433
Virginia and Brooke Hamilton.

89
00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.300
As everyone knows. the Hamiltons
are American royalty.

90
00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.633
Gerald and Gloria Hamilton

91
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.233
are close friends
with the royals.

92
00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:06.133
and Gloria Hamilton herself
hinted that

93
00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:07.834
Prince Ronan Higgins.
considered to be

94
00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:10.066
the world's
most eligible bachelor.

95
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.667
may in fact be
the guest of honor.

96
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.400
Of course.
the burning question is

97
00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:18.500
who will be Prince Ronan's date?

98
00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.967
The Hamilton ball is going to be
a who's who.

99
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.967
and the most sought-after
invite of the year.

100
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.033
In other news--

101
00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:30.300
Rebecca: Gloria Hamilton had a
falling out with Rachel Mann.

102
00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:32.500
the biggest designer in Europe.

103
00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.600
Rebecca. the party
is only two weeks away.

104
00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:38.333
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

105
00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:41.834
I'm going to need more staff.

106
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.800
This is my in to
the highest-level client.

107
00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.100
I mean.
think of the rarefied air.

108
00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:50.133
- And a raise.
- You want a raise?

109
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.834
No. For my current staff.

110
00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:53.600
They haven't had
a day off in a month.

111
00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:54.900
Agreed.

112
00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:56.500
How many dresses do you need?

113
00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:57.934
Gloria Hamilton.

114
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.233
Her mother-in-law. Virginia.

115
00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:01.734
Daughter Brooke.

116
00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:03.300
Whoever Prince Ronan brings
as his date.

117
00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:04.867
Somebody new. I'm sure.

118
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.233
I think the expiration date
on his lady friends

119
00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:07.967
is a month or less.

120
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.066
So. that's at least four.

121
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.500
Who knows how many others
she'll invite?

122
00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:13.367
Okay.
but it's only two weeks away.

123
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.867
and we have the Bremmers
and all our other clients

124
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.133
that we have to take care of.

125
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.166
I know.

126
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.900
And when we're done with this.

127
00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:21.233
we'll talk about more than
just a raise for the others.

128
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:24.667
You mean helping me
start my own brand?

129
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.333
Before too long.

130
00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:29.734
Prince Ronan
will be forced to get married.

131
00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:32.333
If I do this right.

132
00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:34.467
I'll be designing
a royal wedding.

133
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.033
I wouldn't ask. you know--

134
00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:39.467
Of course.

135
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.900
Fantastic!

136
00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:44.967
(chuckling. sighing)

137
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.367
Oh. I have to leave.

138
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.467
I'm having lunch
with Gloria Hamilton.

139
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.066
and I have to get my nails done.

140
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.166
I'll let her know everything's
going to be perfect.

141
00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:06.066
Seriously?

142
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.300
I know. I know.
It's going to be a lot of work.

143
00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:10.367
But if we get this done.
you're all going to get

144
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.533
a week's vacation. paid.

145
00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:15.633
And you're all going to get
a raise.

146
00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:19.300

And you are?

Oh. Oh. Hmm.

Full makeup.

175
00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:40.200
Hello.

176
00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:41.934
I'm sorry.

No. No. it's fine.

179

180
00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:50.266
Um. we were just working on
all the dresses for the party.

181
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.266
Well. Mrs. Hamilton's party.

182
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.100
Nice. Rebecca Raslyn.

183
00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:57.800
Gloria says
she's the best available.

184
00:08:57.934 --> 00:08:59.533
Is she here?

185
00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:03.400
Uh. no. She's actually out
having lunch with Mrs. Hamilton.

186
00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:06.333
Right.
Now that you mention it.

187
00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:09.367
I think I'm supposed to be
there. My mother--

188
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.066
The queen?

189
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.166
Yes.

190
00:09:14.633 --> 00:09:16.667
I'm sorry.
This is just very weird.

191
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.333
Right.

192
00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:22.900
Well. the queen has charged
Gloria with my care.

193
00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:25.333
She's like an aunt to me.

194
00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:27.233
I love her to death.
but she's driving me crazy.

195
00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.200
You'd think I was a schoolboy
the way she's watching over me.

196
00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.200
I don't think
she's even realized

197
00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:32.934
I've snuck out on my own.

198
00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:35.166
Why do some of these
have Rebecca Raslyn's name

199
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.934
at the bottom
and these ones don't?

200
00:09:39.066 --> 00:09:43.233
Oh. Well. I always have to
make minor alterations.

201
00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:45.166
Your job is what. then?

202
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.433
Head seamstress.

203
00:09:47.567 --> 00:09:49.533
Seamstress.

204
00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:54.567
Minor alterations?

205
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.834
Um. yes. I get impulsive ideas.

206
00:09:57.967 --> 00:10:01.400
You see. I like to dare myself
to be spontaneous.

207
00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.066
Spontaneous?

208
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.533
Yes. As in. well.
I get ideas in my head.

209
00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.934
and before they leave my head
I have to get them on paper.

210
00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:12.867
which. I know.
seems very out of character.

211
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.533
since I'm just Ms. Raslyn's
head seamstress.

212
00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:16.100
But you wouldn't know that
about me.

213
00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.500
because you don't know anything
about my character.

214
00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:21.333
I'm sorry. Phew.
I am talking too much.

215
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:25.000
Well. since you're
the seamstress.

216
00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:27.233
maybe you can help me.

217
00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:29.700
Uh-huh. Of course.
What can I do with you?

218
00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.600
For-- For you?

219
00:10:32.734 --> 00:10:35.567
You do more than just dresses?

220
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.667
Specifically.
suits and the like?

221
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.100
Yes. We do a lot of suits.

222
00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:43.233
I do mean something more in line

223
00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:46.600
with royalty. I hate to say.

224
00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:48.433
Yes. I can do that.

225
00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:51.000
Ms. Raslyn can do that.
definitely. She can do anything.

226
00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:53.600
Perfect.
As you can imagine.

227
00:10:53.734 --> 00:10:55.500
what I normally wear
to this sort of thing

228
00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:56.934
can be quite stuffy.

229
00:10:57.066 --> 00:10:59.000
I thought I might change it up
a little.

230
00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:02.734
What did you have in mind?

231
00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:04.667
Well. this is considered
a private event.

232
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.133
So. I don't need to wear
any official attire.

233
00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:10.600
I just don't want to look too...

234
00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:11.834
(snapping fingers)
...stuffy.

235
00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:13.967
- Yes.
- Yes. Okay.

236
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.667
Have you ever considered
growing a Van Dyke

237
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.467
or a Verdi or a Garibaldi?

238
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.100
- (laughing)
- (laughing)

239
00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:25.233
No. See. you know.
my grandfather. he was

240
00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:29.900
rather famous for his Garibaldi.
so I like to avoid that.

241
00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:32.400
Okay.
What about a Fu Manchu?

242
00:11:32.533 --> 00:11:36.066
(giggling)

243
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.333
Less stuffy.
if that makes any sense at all.

244
00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.233
Mm-hmm.

245
00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:44.333
Yes. That makes a lot of sense.

246
00:11:44.467 --> 00:11:47.100
Well. I'll pass on
all that information

247
00:11:47.233 --> 00:11:48.600
to Ms. Raslyn for you.

248
00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:50.433
I would appreciate that.

249
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.934
Well. okay.

250
00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:55.400
I should let you
get back to work.

251
00:11:55.533 --> 00:11:56.734
Yes.

252
00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:58.500
It was nice to meet you.
Cindy Cordella.

253
00:11:58.633 --> 00:12:02.367
You too. Prince Ronan.

254
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.700
Just Ronan. please.

255
00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:08.667
But don't tell Mrs. Hamilton.
She'll tell the queen.

256
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.200
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

257
00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:12.467
Nice meeting you all.

258
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.700
Workers:
Nice to meet you.

259
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.300
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

260
00:12:19.533 --> 00:12:23.166
"I just get these spontaneous
ideas in my head.

261
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.967
and I just have to
get them down on paper."

262
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.000
Okay. Go to lunch. or
you're all going to get fired.

263
00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:28.767
All right. All right.

264
00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:45.967
Hi there.

265
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.667
Hi.

266
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.900
Uh--

267
00:12:50.033 --> 00:12:53.166
No family crest?

268
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.233
Pardon me?

269
00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:58.467
Well. you said you want to look
less official.

270
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.767
so no royal crest on the jacket?

271
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.467
Yes.

272
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.033
I meant to say that before.
Thank you. Good.

273
00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:10.100
After the "Fu Manchu" comment.

274
00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:12.567
I thought you might try to
dress me up in a clown suit.

275
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.100
You jest.

276
00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:17.266
Right. Well. thanks.

277
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.800
Yeah.

278
00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:20.834
Actually. no.
That's not why I'm back.

279
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.533
Would you like to have lunch?

280
00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:25.967
Lunch?

281
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.900
Yes.

282
00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:30.600
- Moi?
- Qui d'autre?

283
00:13:30.734 --> 00:13:33.266
Oh. no. I'm sorry.

284
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.567
I couldn't possibly.

285
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.867
Well. why not?

286
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.567
Well. you're Prince Ronan.

287
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.800
We established that earlier.

288
00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:41.967
And I'm me.

289
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.033
We established that. too.

290
00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:44.367
I know. but that's the point.

291
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.734
What's the point?

292
00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:46.967
Well. why would someone like you

293
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.467
want to go out with
someone like me?

294
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.400
Why would someone like you
want to

295
00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:51.633
go out with someone like me?

296
00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:53.700
- Who wouldn't?
- Exactly.

297
00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.900
But aren't you supposed to be
having lunch with

298
00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:58.734
Mrs. Hamilton and Ms. Raslyn?

299
00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:02.133
I guess I was just feeling

300
00:14:02.266 --> 00:14:03.767
spontaneous.

301
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.033
In the moment. impulsive.
Out of character. even.

302
00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:08.834
But you wouldn't know
it's out of character.

303
00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:10.100
because we only just met.

304
00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:12.500
That's a good answer.

305
00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:14.133
So?

306
00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:17.467
So. you can just do that?

307
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.767
You can go to lunch
with a perfect stranger?

308
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.033
So. you're saying
you're perfect?

309
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.667
Oh. no.
I'm definitely not perfect.

310
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.800
I jest.
And I can assure you.

311
00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:30.266
even members of the royal family
need to eat.

312
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.600
But don't you usually get mobbed
by people and paparazzi?

313
00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:36.600
Guess we'll find out.

314
00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:40.834
Okay.

315
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:42.500
Rebecca:
Cindy?

316
00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:44.200
- Oh. crud.
- What?

317
00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:45.467
Rebecca:
Cindy?

318
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.100
Oh. double crud.

319
00:14:47.233 --> 00:14:48.500
I thought it'd be a good idea

320
00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:52.433
to take a rendering or two
to show Gloria.

321
00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:54.633
Have you come up with any--

322
00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:58.734
Ms. Raslyn. meet Prince Ronan.

323
00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:03.533
Oh. my.

324
00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:05.533
You are Prince Ronan.

325
00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:07.533
(gasping)

326
00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:11.433
Rebecca Raslyn.
It's such an honor to meet you.

327
00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:13.033
The pleasure is all mine.

328
00:15:14.667 --> 00:15:16.900
Are you joining us today
for lunch?

329
00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.667
No.
Something has actually come up.

330
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.900
I'm so sorry.

331
00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:22.734
Oh. That's unfortunate.

332
00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:24.600
- Cindy. actually.
- Cindy what?

333
00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:26.934
I was just asking Cindy
to lunch.

334
00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:28.900
Oh. I'm so sorry. your highness.

335
00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:31.333
I don't think that's
going to be possible.

336
00:15:31.467 --> 00:15:33.567
You see. we're under
tremendous pressure

337
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.700
to get all the dresses finished.

338
00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.834
So she said.

339
00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:39.066
Another time?

340
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.233
Yes. Of course.

341
00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:45.200
And I'll see you at the estate.
for the fittings?

342
00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:47.900
- I'll be there.
- Perfect.

343
00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:49.867
Uh. allow me to escort you out.

344
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.367
Thank you.

345
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.467
And you know. remember.
Less royal.

346
00:15:57.467 --> 00:16:00.166
Ronan:
Thank you very much.

347
00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:16.967
What on earth was that about?

348
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.600
Oh. we were just discussing
what he was going to wear

349
00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:20.834
to the ball.

350
00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:22.667
- And?
- And nothing.

351
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.767
He actually asked you to lunch?

352
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.834
Actually. yes.

353
00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:30.433
Cindy. sweetie--

354
00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:32.333
Not to mention we don't
fraternize with the clients.

355
00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:34.133
He's a member
of the royal family.

356
00:16:34.266 --> 00:16:36.633
The press would have
a field day.

357
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.567
Besides. his reputation
precedes him.

358
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.567
Don't get involved in
some romantic folly.

359
00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:46.834
I wouldn't dream of it.

360
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.734
Cindy:
Rebecca is right.

361
00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:02.266
There's no way he was asking me
out on an actual date.

362
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.266
You're talented and smart.
Why wouldn't he?

363
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.367
But he's a prince.
I'm not royal.

364
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.200
- Oh.
- I can't go out with him.

365
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:12.800
Well. maybe the fact that you're
a commoner is appealing to him.

366
00:17:12.934 --> 00:17:13.900
He has a reputation. you know.

367
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.233
Expects me to fall for him
at his feet.

368
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.767
Stop.

369
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.133
What makes him a royal. anyway?
Just 'cause he was born into it?

370
00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:22.133
They get built up
like some mythical beings.

371
00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:25.767
But some of them
are actually humans.

372
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.633
You always hear about
supermodels

373
00:17:27.767 --> 00:17:30.567
who never get asked out 'cause
guys are intimidated by them.

374
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.600
Well. maybe it's the same thing
with him.

375
00:17:33.734 --> 00:17:36.867
He was really nice.

376
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.433
That's a start.

377
00:17:38.567 --> 00:17:40.233
No. I mean. he was real.

378
00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:42.700
He wasn't trying to put on
a show.

379
00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:44.967
There was definitely
a connection between us.

380
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.734
Didn't you see the connection?

381
00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.100
Huh. I saw some drool coming out
of the side of your mouth.

382
00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:50.367
Okay.

383
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.600
No. That did not happen.

384
00:17:51.734 --> 00:17:53.967
But when he came back.

385
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.800
he was just real.

386
00:17:56.934 --> 00:18:00.133
Then Rebecca.
she had to put an end to it.

387
00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:02.166
- Oh. Shocking.
- I know.

388
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.633
She told me
not to get caught up in

389
00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:05.133
the romantic follies of it all.

390
00:18:05.266 --> 00:18:07.200
which is her way of warning me
to stay away.

391
00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:08.700
Hmm.

392
00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:12.600
So. when are you seeing him
again?

393
00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:17.467
I don't know. sir.

394
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.800
- Now. get with your sewing.
- Okay.

395
00:18:18.934 --> 00:18:20.033
That butterfly
does not look good.

396
00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:22.200
Sure.

397
00:18:57.567 --> 00:18:58.867
(doorbell buzzing)

398
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.033
Concierge: Hamilton estate.
May I help you?

399
00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:03.066
Yeah. Hi.
My name is Cindy Cordella.

400
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.667
I'm here to do a fitting.

401
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.266
Concierge:
I can't hear you.

402
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.200
Oh. My name is Cindy Cordella.
and I'm here to do a fitting.

403
00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:12.433
(chuckling)

404
00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:14.500
Concierge:
Your name. please?

405
00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:19.166
It's Cindy Cordella.
I work for Rebecca Raslyn.

406
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.233
Concierge:
Do you have an appointment?

407
00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:24.600
Hello? Are you still there?

408
00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:26.333
Yes. I'm here.

409
00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:27.667
My name is Cindy Cordella.

410
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.834
I'm here to do a fitting
for the ball.

411
00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:31.633
Concierge:
May I have your name?

412
00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:48.600
Thank you.

413
00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:49.967
Wow.

414
00:19:58.066 --> 00:20:00.433
You must be Cindy.

415
00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.066
Gloria Hamilton.

416
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.934
Oh. I know who you are.
It's very nice to meet you.

417
00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:09.066
Well. we're very excited to wear
Rebecca Raslyn to the ball.

418
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.166
And so pleased that
she was willing to take on

419
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.200
such a massive undertaking
on such short notice.

420
00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:16.834
Only the highest standards
will do.

421
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:21.033
Yes. Especially when hobnobbing
with such honest politicians.

422
00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:25.500
humble public servants
and. lest we forget.

423
00:20:25.633 --> 00:20:27.433
unassuming royalty.

424
00:20:27.567 --> 00:20:28.867
Ordinary would never do
around here.

425
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.433
My mother-in-law.
Virginia Hamilton.

426
00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:33.767
Oh. It's very nice
to meet you as well.

427
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900
Aren't you adorable.

428
00:20:36.033 --> 00:20:37.166
Are you married yet. dear?

429
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.500
Mother--

430
00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:41.867
Oh. Uh. married? Um. no.
Not at all.

431
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.200
Oh? Why not?

432
00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:44.900
Oh. Virginia. please.

433
00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:47.600
Well. there must be a reason.

434
00:20:47.734 --> 00:20:51.266
Well. I guess I haven't met
the right guy yet.

435
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.033
Maybe the right guy
hasn't met you.

436
00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:55.200
Virginia.
leave the poor girl alone.

437
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:56.900
Can we get started?

438
00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:59.400
Oh. yes. Of course.

439
00:20:59.533 --> 00:21:01.333
If we put all the money
that we're spending on the ball

440
00:21:01.467 --> 00:21:02.467
toward the charity.

441
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.467
we wouldn't have to have
a ball at all.

442
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.600
The point is to raise awareness
for the charity. Mother.

443
00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:09.433
The world will be watching.

444
00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:11.900
especially with Prince Ronan
as our guest.

445
00:21:12.033 --> 00:21:14.400
It has to be perfect.

446
00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:16.166
It always does.

447
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.000
Where would you like to set up?

448
00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:21.333
Well. wherever there's
enough space.

449
00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:26.433
In that case. any room will do.
Follow me.

450
00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:42.166
This is all for the ball?

451
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.667
Well. most of it. yes.

452
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.233
But we're also hosting
a private dinner party

453
00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.300
for some of our
more prominent guests.

454
00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.467
Oh. There's also a dinner party?

455
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.900
Oh. relax.

456
00:21:52.033 --> 00:21:54.133
We already have our dresses
for that.

457
00:21:54.266 --> 00:21:56.400
Not as formal.

458
00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:58.834
We wouldn't want to upstage
the ball. would we?

459
00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:00.166
No. Of course not.

460
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.533
You can set up here.

461
00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:03.633
I'll get the others.

462
00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.734
Thank you.

463
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.400
So. your boss allows you
out of the cellar after all.

464
00:22:11.533 --> 00:22:14.233
When I'm good. yes.

465
00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:16.133
My offer still stands. you know.

466
00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:17.500
And what offer is that?

467
00:22:17.633 --> 00:22:18.800
Lunch.

468
00:22:18.934 --> 00:22:21.166
Oh. Well. it turns out

469
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700
I'm not allowed to
fraternize with the clientele.

470
00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:25.500
Well. they've told me
not to fraternize

471
00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:27.400
with their seamstress.
so we're even.

472
00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:31.300
But the difference is
I'll get fired.

473
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.900
You won't.

474
00:22:33.033 --> 00:22:37.834
After seeing your alterations.
I don't think your boss

475
00:22:37.967 --> 00:22:40.033
is going to be firing you
anytime soon.

476
00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:44.400
I don't think you know
Rebecca Raslyn.

477
00:22:44.533 --> 00:22:47.967
You don't know the Hamiltons.
Very tight with my mother.

478
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.300
She's given them carte blanche

479
00:22:49.433 --> 00:22:50.667
to treat me
like one of their own.

480
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.800
I have to toe the line.

481
00:22:52.934 --> 00:22:56.467
But I'm willing to risk it
if you are.

482
00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.734
How are your designs coming?

483
00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:02.367
I'm sorry. Your alterations.

484
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.233
Look. I didn't articulate
my job description very well.

485
00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:09.600
These are all Rebecca Raslyn's
designs and hers alone.

486
00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:11.100
Uh-huh.

487
00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:13.300
Julia:
There you are. Ronan.

488
00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:15.600
I thought you were waiting
for me in the parlor.

489
00:23:15.734 --> 00:23:18.900
I got distracted. Sorry.

490
00:23:19.033 --> 00:23:21.266
Ah. This must be our designer.

491
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.533
Uh. no.
She's the head seamstress.

492
00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:25.567
Oh. Julia Gilmore.

493
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.800
Oh. Cindy Cordella.
I work for Rebecca Raslyn.

494
00:23:28.934 --> 00:23:31.867
Ah. Well. we're all excited.

495
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.533
I'm not as hip
to American fashion

496
00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:35.133
as some of the others.

497
00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:37.633
but I hear nothing but the best
about Rebecca Raslyn.

498
00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:38.900
She's wonderful and amazing.

499
00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:40.600
Hmm.

500
00:23:40.734 --> 00:23:42.533
Well. I'll be with ladies.
my darling.

501
00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:45.233
Nice to meet you. Cindy.

502
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.367
You asked me to lunch.
but you have a girlfriend.

503
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.633
I don't have
a girlfriend.

504
00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:59.700
Then who was that darling?

505
00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:03.367
She is not exactly
my girlfriend.

506
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.767
"Not exactly" means "sort of."

507
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.867
which means
the question still stands.

508
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.700
It has been put upon us to be
each other's date to the ball.

509
00:24:11.834 --> 00:24:13.300
By whom?

510
00:24:13.433 --> 00:24:15.100
My mother. of course. The queen.

511
00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:18.333
She and my father are quite
eager to get me married off.

512
00:24:18.467 --> 00:24:19.934
To the right sort. of course.

513
00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:22.700
And I take it that she is
the right sort?

514
00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:25.200
They seem to think so.

515
00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:28.367
Which means. Ronan.

516
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.600
you have a girlfriend.

517
00:24:30.734 --> 00:24:32.166
Not exactly.

518
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.600
Ronan. I think it'd be best

519
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:36.433
if you leave the young lady
to her work

520
00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:38.133
so that we can get started.

521
00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:40.600
Yes. Of course.

522
00:24:40.734 --> 00:24:42.767
Sorry I distracted you.

523
00:24:44.834 --> 00:24:47.133
I think you'll make her
uncomfortable

524
00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:49.033
if you sit and watch.

525
00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:51.166
Well. Gloria.
I'm getting fitted as well.

526
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.467
Isn't that right?
What we discussed yesterday?

527
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.667
You've already met?

528
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.367
Yes. At their workshop.

529
00:24:59.233 --> 00:25:03.066
Cindy. the ladies would prefer
another room.

530
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.900
Less of a chill.

531
00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:09.266
Uh. in what room in this house
isn't there a chill. Gloria?

532
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.367
If you'll follow me once again--

533
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.600
Oh. yes. Of course.

534
00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:16.033
(papers rustling)

535
00:25:16.166 --> 00:25:17.967
I will await you here.
for my sizing.

536
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.133
Brooke. this is our seamstress.

537
00:25:37.266 --> 00:25:38.433
Cindy:
Hi.

538
00:25:38.567 --> 00:25:40.033
Hi. I'm Brooke Hamilton.

539
00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.533
Oh. yes. You are Mrs. Hamilton's
daughter. correct?

540
00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:44.200
Yes. That is right.

541
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.600
Are these the designs?

542
00:25:45.734 --> 00:25:48.266
Yes. I have several options
for you.

543
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.200
All I need to do is
take your measurements.

544
00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:52.033
and voila.

545
00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.266
You'll be wearing the latest
Rebecca Raslyn for the ball.

546
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.400
Well. I'm sure
it's not that simple.

547
00:25:56.533 --> 00:25:59.200
Her staff will be working day
and night to get these done.

548
00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:00.533
Oh. yes. they will.

549
00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:02.533
My number is on the back
of this card

550
00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:04.467
if you have any questions
between now and then.

551
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.934
I think we'll be fighting over
a few of these.

552
00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:11.166
Oh. I'm wearing that one. Sorry.

553
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.500
What do you think
will compliment me best. Cindy?

554
00:26:13.633 --> 00:26:14.934
Oh. I really think that

555
00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:16.934
you'll look fantastic
in anything.

556
00:26:17.066 --> 00:26:18.834
You're very sweet.

557
00:26:18.967 --> 00:26:21.600
We really should be asking
Rebecca. Don't you think?

558
00:26:21.734 --> 00:26:22.967
Well. isn't she coming?

559
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.033
I mean. surely
it'd make a difference

560
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.100
if she actually met us.

561
00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:26.700
Yes. Well. today is just about

562
00:26:26.834 --> 00:26:29.467
discussions and measurements.

563
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.500
and then I'm going to relay
all that information to Rebecca.

564
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:33.700
Yeah. But she can't know
exactly what we should wear

565
00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:34.834
until she meets us.

566
00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:36.767
Brookie. you're in good hands.

567
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.000
Brooke:
What would you know about it?

568
00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:39.533
You've known her five minutes.

569
00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:42.100
I'm sorry. Is there no respect
for the royal opinion

570
00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:43.667
on this side of the pond?

571
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.967
Apologies. I had no idea
that you were interested

572
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.500
in being a fashion connoisseur
until now.

573
00:26:48.633 --> 00:26:50.667
Brooke. Ronan is our guest.

574
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.300
Maintain decorum. darling.

575
00:26:52.433 --> 00:26:53.934
Don't mind us.

576
00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:55.166
Oh. no.

577
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.633
Ronan is like a brother to me.

578
00:26:56.767 --> 00:26:59.934
Yes. The cherished and respected
brother you always wanted.

579
00:27:00.133 --> 00:27:02.200
- You're so charming.
- Enough.

580
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:05.934
On that note. I am going to
leave you ladies to it.

581
00:27:06.066 --> 00:27:07.433
- Cindy?
- Mm-hmm?

582
00:27:07.567 --> 00:27:10.033
Yes. I will take
your measurements.

583
00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:12.200
- I will start with you. Julia.
- Yes.

584
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.567
Where's grandmother?

585
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.200
She will have a meltdown
if her dress isn't right.

586
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.000
I'll go find her.

587
00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:23.100
Be kind.

588
00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:25.700
Oh. I think your figure
is going to be perfect.

589
00:27:25.834 --> 00:27:27.166
Julia:
Nonsense.

590
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.633
I've put on a pound
since last month.

591
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.834
Do you want to go back to
looking stuffy?

592
00:27:45.967 --> 00:27:49.200
Uh. pardon?

593
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:50.333
Well. I still need
to measure you.

594
00:27:50.467 --> 00:27:51.834
Unless you want to go back to

595
00:27:51.967 --> 00:27:53.700
your old standard royal threads.
which you say

596
00:27:53.834 --> 00:27:56.533
you always have to wear
at these sort of events.

597
00:27:56.667 --> 00:27:59.066
Hmm.

598
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.600
No. I'd like the Cindy Cordella
special. please.

599
00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:04.166
You mean Rebecca Raslyn.

600
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.734
If you say so.

601
00:28:05.867 --> 00:28:08.266
She has something in mind
for you

602
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.934
that I think you'll like.

603
00:28:11.066 --> 00:28:13.400
Be sure to tell her
I appreciate that.

604
00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:15.934
Take off your jacket. please.

605
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.367
I. uh--

606
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.100
Sorry about the confusion.

607
00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:26.767
My situation with Julia.

608
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.600
Is it really that confusing?

609
00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:33.133
Yes. in fact.

610
00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:35.734
Then why did you
ask me to lunch. then?

611
00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:39.834
Must I really need a reason
to ask you for lunch?

612
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.300
Great works are performed
not by strength.

613
00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:49.233
but patience and perseverance.

614
00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:52.400
Can I quote you on that?

615
00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:56.934
I think I read it
in a book somewhere.

616
00:28:57.066 --> 00:28:58.834
(Cindy sighing)

617
00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:01.834
You still didn't answer
my question.

618
00:29:01.967 --> 00:29:06.133
Like I told you.
it was a spontaneous moment.

619
00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:10.233
Impulsive.
and maybe out of character.

620
00:29:12.433 --> 00:29:14.900
Must a prince
always be in character?

621
00:29:15.033 --> 00:29:18.633
Well. you do tend to
gallivant the globe.

622
00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:21.834
accumulating
a certain reputation.

623
00:29:21.967 --> 00:29:23.500
Well. I suppose.

624
00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:26.400
It may not seem like it
from my public persona.

625
00:29:26.533 --> 00:29:28.967
but my life is so mapped out.

626
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.200
I hardly get to make
many choices of my own.

627
00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:33.533
See. my parents are grooming me

628
00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:37.133
to be something
that I might not be.

629
00:29:40.834 --> 00:29:42.834
Is that the future king?

630
00:29:42.967 --> 00:29:45.800
That's part of it.

631
00:29:45.934 --> 00:29:50.367
And does that life include
the future queen?

632
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.700
But of course.

633
00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:56.166
It's all part of
the royal public image.

634
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.000
And Julia comes from
a powerful political family.

635
00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:02.100
It's all part of the chess game
that politics are.

636
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.734
I probably shouldn't be
boring you with all of this.

637
00:30:08.867 --> 00:30:10.433
No.

638
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:15.567
I thought you were being
nicely spontaneous.

639
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.367
which is okay by me.

640
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.467
Okay. then.

641
00:30:21.767 --> 00:30:24.400
When I came to town by myself.

642
00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:26.000
no press. no handlers.

643
00:30:26.133 --> 00:30:29.200
no posing for the paparazzi.

644
00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:32.567
you know. it was the first time
I'd done that in a long time.

645
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.166
It was refreshing.

646
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.834
You were refreshing.

647
00:30:36.967 --> 00:30:40.567
Which is what brought out
that moment of spontaneity.

648
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.066
I guess.

649
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.066
Because of
your momentary freedom.

650
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.567
or me?

651
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.266
Both.

652
00:30:58.667 --> 00:31:01.133
That's an honest answer.

653
00:31:06.033 --> 00:31:10.800
But the fact remains.
you have a girlfriend.

654
00:31:10.934 --> 00:31:12.567
She's not my girlfriend.

655
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.200
Does she know that?

656
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.300
Ah. Julia. Hi.

657
00:31:19.433 --> 00:31:20.633
You have trunks full of tuxes.

658
00:31:20.767 --> 00:31:22.300
Do you really need
to be tailored?

659
00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:24.467
It would be inappropriate
to wear something outdated

660
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.367
to such a big event.

661
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.233
The press can be rather harsh
on things like that. right?

662
00:31:28.367 --> 00:31:31.367
Yeah. Yes. Right.

663
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.200
Right.

664
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:34.433
Virginia is ready for you.

665
00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:35.967
Oh. yes. Of course.

666
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.967
Excuse me.

667
00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:52.934
Any wondrous plans
for Saturday evening. dear?

668
00:31:53.066 --> 00:31:55.100
Um. no. I'm just working.

669
00:31:55.233 --> 00:31:57.934
We are having a dinner party
here Saturday evening.

670
00:31:58.066 --> 00:31:59.600
You should be our guest.

671
00:31:59.734 --> 00:32:04.266
Oh. no. I couldn't possibly.
But thank you so much.

672
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.467
Why not?

673
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.934
Mother. the dinner
is in honor of

674
00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:09.433
our guest. Prince Ronan.

675
00:32:09.567 --> 00:32:11.266
And?

676
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.033
And I wouldn't dream of inviting
someone without his consent.

677
00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.900
Well. in that case.
I think it's a marvelous idea.

678
00:32:19.266 --> 00:32:20.800
Unless you have other plans.

679
00:32:20.934 --> 00:32:22.166
Brooke:
Honestly. Ronan.

680
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.433
She'll be working
on our dresses.

681
00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:24.667
and I mean. it'll be a miracle

682
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.967
if they're done in time
as it is.

683
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.200
Then it's settled.

684
00:32:27.333 --> 00:32:29.000
Ronan:
I say it isn't.

685
00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:31.633
Wouldn't it be
a good opportunity for Cindy

686
00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:33.266
to spend a bit more time
with everyone.

687
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.300
get to know them
a little better?

688
00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:37.200
Get to know us?

689
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:40.467
Yes. Uh. to inspire
more personalized dresses.

690
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.033
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

691
00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:44.633
So. it's settled.

692
00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:47.033
I am so confused.
Aren't you the seamstress?

693
00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:48.834
Quite right.

694
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.266
It does seem more prudent
to invite Rebecca.

695
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.700
so that she can more personalize
our dresses.

696
00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:57.133
Well. you know. Cindy is
her eyes and ears. and--

697
00:32:57.266 --> 00:32:59.533
It's a very exclusive list.

698
00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:02.767
For crying out loud.
Gloria.

699
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.000
invite them both if you must.

700
00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:07.166
There'll be enough food
to feed Philadelphia

701
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.700
and half the poor in the state.

702
00:33:10.834 --> 00:33:12.500
The poor girl
is working her tail off

703
00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:14.400
making you look better
than you are.

704
00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:17.200
Grandmother!

705
00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.734
Gloria:
Very well.

706
00:33:18.867 --> 00:33:21.066
Please attend as our guest.

707
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.033
I think it's a great idea.

708
00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:26.600
In fact. bring a date.

709
00:33:28.734 --> 00:33:30.500
Do come to the dinner
party. dear.

710
00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:34.500
I have a feeling that you won't
be the only one who's inspired.

711
00:33:34.633 --> 00:33:36.934
- Ronan. darling--
- Yes. Of course.

712
00:33:48.734 --> 00:33:50.333
Reggie:
So. you're going?

713
00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:51.533
Yeah. I'm going.

714
00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:52.834
It's a work thing.

715
00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:54.533
Unreal.

716
00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:56.333
You're actually going to
Prince Ronan's welcome party.

717
00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.834
So is Julia. just to be clear.

718
00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:00.600
Uh. his not-girlfriend?

719
00:34:00.734 --> 00:34:02.433
No. It's his girlfriend.
Trust me.

720
00:34:02.567 --> 00:34:04.333
There's big a difference
between a girlfriend

721
00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:06.567
and a date. and he told you
she's just his date.

722
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.500
Yeah. but she doesn't think
that he's just her date.

723
00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:09.834
and that matters.

724
00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:11.834
All that matters
is what he thinks.

725
00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:13.400
I think he's confused.

726
00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:14.934
Un-confuse him.

727
00:34:15.066 --> 00:34:16.433
No. I'm not doing that.
I'm not playing that game.

728
00:34:16.567 --> 00:34:17.734
He should know what he wants.

729
00:34:17.867 --> 00:34:19.400
Yeah. He does.

730
00:34:19.533 --> 00:34:22.500
You should have seen
all their faces

731
00:34:22.633 --> 00:34:24.667
when the grandmother
invited me to go.

732
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.600
They were all looking at me
like evil stepsisters.

733
00:34:26.734 --> 00:34:29.700
Oh. Which could lead to
a fairy-tale ending.

734
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.834
What you doing?

735
00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:09.233
Oh. I was just checking

736
00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:10.500
the flow and the movement
of the dress.

737
00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:11.734
- It works perfectly.
- Okay.

738
00:35:11.867 --> 00:35:14.266
- Rebecca: Cindy?
- Oh. in here.

739
00:35:18.767 --> 00:35:20.667
I need something to wear to
the dinner party. Any thoughts?

740
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.667
Yes. You have a few dresses
you haven't worn.

741
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.233
I will pull them from storage.

742
00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:27.533
(chuckling) Okay.
Nothing too formal. so I'm told.

743
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:30.066
Rebecca?

744
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.734
Yes?

745
00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:35.800
I was asked to the party
as well.

746
00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:37.033
The Hamilton party?

747
00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:38.533
(laughing)
Don't be silly.

748
00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:40.233
Oh. yeah. She was invited.

749
00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:44.033
We already discussed
fraternizing with the clients.

750
00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:47.233
No. no.
It's nothing like that.

751
00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:50.500
Actually. um. Virginia Hamilton

752
00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:52.834
asked me to attend.

753
00:35:52.967 --> 00:35:54.233
You see. they're all
a bit concerned about

754
00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:56.133
what they're going to wear
to the ball.

755
00:35:56.266 --> 00:35:57.567
So. the thought is I would go.

756
00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.233
I would get to know
their personalities.

757
00:35:59.367 --> 00:36:00.967
See how they walk.
how they interact.

758
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.367
That way. you can design
their perfect dress for them.

759
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.867
Hmm. I guess I see
the wisdom in that.

760
00:36:10.767 --> 00:36:13.467
I'm going to help you branch out
on your own.

761
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.033
but right now it's important
that the Hamiltons

762
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:18.433
and Prince Ronan and his date
show the world

763
00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:21.400
they are wearing Rebecca Raslyn.

764
00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:22.734
And they need to know

765
00:36:22.867 --> 00:36:24.934
they are wearing Rebecca Raslyn.

766
00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:27.033
if you know what I mean.

767
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.033
So. is that a yes?

768
00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:31.767
You have my blessing.

769
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.233
Just do your best to blend in.

770
00:36:34.367 --> 00:36:36.867
The last thing we want to do
is draw attention to ourselves.

771
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.800
Her blessing?

772
00:36:39.934 --> 00:36:41.133
All a means to an end.

773
00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:43.834
Yeah. Whose end?

774
00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:02.300
(heels clicking on floor)

775
00:37:05.467 --> 00:37:08.433
(ringtone sounding)

776
00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:13.266
Hello?

777
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.300
Is this Cindy?

778
00:37:14.433 --> 00:37:16.367
Uh. yes. Who is this?

779
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.500
It's Julia.

780
00:37:18.633 --> 00:37:20.433
Gilmore.
Prince Ronan's date.

781
00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:23.166
Oh. yeah. Hi.

782
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.867
Sorry to bother you. but
I wanted to let you know that

783
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.467
the other girls and I.

784
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.700
we've decided to have
a little fun

785
00:37:28.834 --> 00:37:30.500
for the dinner party.

786
00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:32.767
We're going to dress casual.

787
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.300
Super casual. to be comfortable.
if you know what I mean.

788
00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:40.600
Oh. Really?

789
00:37:40.734 --> 00:37:44.266
It'll be absolutely brilliant
to see the look on their faces.

790
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.767
Oh. yeah. Okay.

791
00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.200
Are you sure?

792
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.300
Yes. of course.

793
00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:53.967
Let's all have
a sense of humor about this.

794
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.133
It'll be good for Ronan.

795
00:37:57.266 --> 00:37:58.600
I hope I can count on you?

796
00:37:58.734 --> 00:38:00.900
Yeah. yeah. Of course.
Of course. Yeah.

797
00:38:01.033 --> 00:38:03.000
I. um-- I definitely have
something casual lying around.

798
00:38:03.133 --> 00:38:04.700
so. yes.

799
00:38:04.834 --> 00:38:07.867
Wonderful. See you here.

800
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.767
Talk to you later. Bye.

801
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.133
(beeping phone off. sighing)

802
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.934
Casual.

803
00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:41.166
Hi there. Thanks so much.

804
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.867
(glasses clinking)

805
00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:02.100
My.

806
00:39:02.233 --> 00:39:05.100
What a unique choice.

807
00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:08.433
Yeah. I think I misunderstood.

808
00:39:08.567 --> 00:39:11.266
You see. I got a phone call
and someone told me that--

809
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.900
Help yourself to champagne.
hors d'oeuvres.

810
00:39:15.033 --> 00:39:16.900
Thank you.

811
00:39:17.033 --> 00:39:18.934
Did you not get my text?

812
00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:21.834
Oh. no. I clearly didn't. No.

813
00:39:21.967 --> 00:39:24.333
Oh. I'm so sorry. dear.

814
00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:25.900
We decided--

815
00:39:26.033 --> 00:39:28.400
Well. Mrs. Hamilton caught word
and forbade us.

816
00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:29.667
She was certain

817
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.300
it would get back to
their majesties.

818
00:39:31.433 --> 00:39:32.967
Brooke: Prince Ronan
is under her guardianship

819
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.633
as well as her hospitality.
after all.

820
00:39:35.767 --> 00:39:38.934
and didn't want him
to be embarrassed.

821
00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:40.166
They have no sense of humor.

822
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.467
(both laughing)

823
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.066
(laughing)

824
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.400
Yeah. I think I'm going to
go home and change.

825
00:39:45.533 --> 00:39:47.800
- So--
- Oh. nonsense.

826
00:39:47.934 --> 00:39:49.633
You look better than
most of the people here.

827
00:39:49.767 --> 00:39:51.433
Come. Let's get you a drink.

828
00:39:51.567 --> 00:39:52.667
Oh. no. That's okay.

829
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.367
I think I'm going to get myself
a drink.

830
00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:01.100
Oh. I'll have a little.
Thank you.

831
00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.667
(sighing)

832
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.300
Well. you look good.

833
00:40:06.433 --> 00:40:07.567
Mmm.

834
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.300
Ooh. That's a bad T-shirt.
though.

835
00:40:09.433 --> 00:40:11.633
I think
I could have done better.

836
00:40:11.767 --> 00:40:15.333
It's really inappropriate.

837
00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:19.000
Which one of them
put you up to this?

838
00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:20.734
Does it matter?

839
00:40:20.867 --> 00:40:24.800
You possess trust.
That's a good thing in my eyes.

840
00:40:24.934 --> 00:40:27.800
Besides.

841
00:40:27.934 --> 00:40:29.800
my instinct was correct.

842
00:40:29.934 --> 00:40:32.000
And what instinct is that?

843
00:40:32.133 --> 00:40:33.600
You're a threat.

844
00:40:33.734 --> 00:40:38.433
(laughing)
Me. a threat? Mm-mmm.

845
00:40:38.567 --> 00:40:39.967
You're the type of person

846
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.567
who makes these kind of people
uncomfortable.

847
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.667
'Cause you're real.

848
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.567
and it reminds them
that they're not.

849
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.967
You stand out.
Makes them jealous.

850
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.100
Just make sure you get
the last laugh.

851
00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:55.433
Right. Well. good job
fitting in. Cindy.

852
00:40:55.567 --> 00:40:57.567
You only live once. Heh.

853
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.367
Well. great works
are performed not by strength.

854
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.233
but by patience
and perseverance.

855
00:41:02.367 --> 00:41:06.066
Ah. Have you eaten?

856
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.300
No. I haven't.
and I am so hungry.

857
00:41:07.433 --> 00:41:08.633
Ah. Well. come.

858
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.033
Gloria. darling.

859
00:41:24.166 --> 00:41:27.033
Rebecca. you look marvelous.

860
00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:29.600
Ah. You always know
just what to wear.

861
00:41:29.734 --> 00:41:31.033
Oh.

862
00:41:31.166 --> 00:41:33.734
So many people are waiting
to see you.

863
00:41:35.934 --> 00:41:38.433
Oh. Ms. Raslyn.
the designs you came up with

864
00:41:38.567 --> 00:41:41.533
for our dresses
are positively perfection.

865
00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:43.033
Oh.

866
00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:45.066
We are so excited.

867
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.767
Well. you ladies
certainly make it easier

868
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.233
to define beauty.

869
00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:51.300
- Oh. thank you.
- (laughing)

870
00:41:51.433 --> 00:41:53.500
You're too kind.

871
00:41:57.834 --> 00:41:58.767
(laughing)

872
00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.233
Excuse me.

873
00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:09.467
Why are you wearing that?

874
00:42:11.567 --> 00:42:12.633
(laughing)

875
00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:14.533
I'm teasing.

876
00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:17.467
I'm envious.

877
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.133
Have you noticed how
everyone in this family

878
00:42:20.266 --> 00:42:22.467
always seems to be
posing for a photograph.

879
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.567
even though one
isn't being taken?

880
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.700
You look really beautiful
tonight. Mrs. Hamilton.

881
00:42:29.834 --> 00:42:31.800
Oh. please call me Virginia.

882
00:42:31.934 --> 00:42:34.033
Although it takes
a lot more work at my age.

883
00:42:34.166 --> 00:42:37.600
But just once. I'd love to
be able to be seen in public

884
00:42:37.734 --> 00:42:40.767
wearing normal clothes.

885
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.767
Don't take that for granted.

886
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.033
I won't.

887
00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:46.367
- You're a dear.
- Oh. thank you.

888
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.266
(both laughing)

889
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.333
All right. everyone.
Here we go.

890
00:42:51.467 --> 00:42:53.934
- Man: Oh. my. Look at him.
- (woman laughing)

891
00:42:54.066 --> 00:42:55.367
(people applauding)

892
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.166
What are you doing?

893
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.300
Trying not to fit in.

894
00:42:59.433 --> 00:43:01.834
Honestly. Ronan. the
photographers will be here soon.

895
00:43:01.967 --> 00:43:05.367
Perfect. Everyone. gather round.
Form a circle.

896
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.900
So. since this party
is being held in my honor.

897
00:43:08.033 --> 00:43:09.900
I thought that we would

898
00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:12.000
continue a Hamilton
tradition before we dine.

899
00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:15.200
Now. those who want to play.
pick a card.

900
00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:16.734
Ronan. dear--

901
00:43:16.867 --> 00:43:18.533
Prince Ronan.

902
00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:19.900
- (chuckling)
- Joking.

903
00:43:20.033 --> 00:43:21.834
(everyone laughing)

904
00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:26.100
So. uh. I don't get to
play these games much back home.

905
00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:28.367
so I appreciate if
you just would indulge me.

906
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.467
Pick a card?

907
00:43:31.667 --> 00:43:33.633
Thank you.

908
00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:38.033
Okay. Not you. dear.

909
00:43:38.166 --> 00:43:40.133
Ah.

910
00:43:43.367 --> 00:43:45.166
Ronan:
Pick a good one.

911
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.266
Perfect. Cindy?

912
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.900
I'm not really a part of
the traditions here.

913
00:43:49.033 --> 00:43:50.266
You are now.

914
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.934
Come on. Pick a card.
It'll be fun.

915
00:43:53.066 --> 00:43:54.867
Nice jeans.

916
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.600
You're not
the only outcast here.

917
00:43:56.734 --> 00:44:00.400
Okay. So. first game up.

918
00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:02.800
- Minute to Win It.
- (people gasping. murmuring)

919
00:44:02.934 --> 00:44:04.066
Now. you will have one minute

920
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.834
to pass this ball

921
00:44:06.967 --> 00:44:09.433
from your elbow
to your partner's.

922
00:44:09.567 --> 00:44:10.967
but you can't touch it
with your hands.

923
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.600
If you're playing.

924
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:14.700
put your card in the box.

925
00:44:15.967 --> 00:44:17.166
Thank you.

926
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.834
- No peeking.
- I won't.

927
00:44:19.967 --> 00:44:21.433
Thank you.

928
00:44:21.567 --> 00:44:22.867
Get it in there.

929
00:44:24.266 --> 00:44:26.467
Yes. Get it in there.

930
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.000
(laughing)

931
00:44:28.133 --> 00:44:30.233
(rattling)

932
00:44:32.133 --> 00:44:35.767
Okay. So. first up. we have...

933
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.967
...eight of diamonds.

934
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.166
(gasping. laughing)
That's me.

935
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.767
Perfect. And then next. we have
the queen of spades.

936
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.734
That's me. (laughing)

937
00:44:45.867 --> 00:44:47.000
Great. So. Brookie.

938
00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:49.000
you have called first.
You get the ball.

939
00:44:49.133 --> 00:44:50.934
Thank you.

940
00:44:51.066 --> 00:44:52.000
Ronan:
Go.

941
00:44:52.133 --> 00:44:53.467
Okay. Um--

942
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.633
Man:
Here we go.

943
00:44:55.767 --> 00:44:56.734
- Onlookers: Oh!
- Oh. Oh!

944
00:44:56.867 --> 00:44:58.000
- (laughing)
- Close.

945
00:44:58.133 --> 00:44:59.133
Okay. Do it again.

946
00:44:59.266 --> 00:45:02.300
Ooh. Ooh! Ooh!

947
00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.000
(onlookers laughing. shrieking)

948
00:45:05.133 --> 00:45:07.000
Wow.

949
00:45:07.133 --> 00:45:09.066
- Been practicing?
- Hardly.

950
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.000
Next up. we have

951
00:45:11.133 --> 00:45:14.233
the ace of diamonds.

952
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.967
Hmm. Well.

953
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.667
And then playing with you.
we have the--

954
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.033
Ah. Jack of hearts. My card.

955
00:45:23.166 --> 00:45:25.533
Onlookers:
Oh.

956
00:45:25.667 --> 00:45:27.633
Would you be so kind?

957
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.233
Thank you. Cindy. come on.

958
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.500
- (laughing)
- Can you start with the ball?

959
00:45:33.633 --> 00:45:37.233
Count down for us.
starting now.

960
00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:38.633
This is so silly.

961
00:45:38.767 --> 00:45:39.867
- Come on.
- All right.

962
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.467
Just a minute. All right?

963
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.867
Oh. Oh. Careful. Spin.

964
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.967
- Okay. It's fine.
- (laughing)

965
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.400
It's okay. Okay. Okay.

966
00:45:47.533 --> 00:45:48.500
- All right.
- Okay.

967
00:45:48.633 --> 00:45:50.867
Now. you all right? You okay?

968
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
- Yeah.
- It's okay. Come on.

969
00:45:52.133 --> 00:45:53.500
- Ah!
- Oh. no.

970
00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:55.166
- (shrieking)
- Onlookers: Oh!

971
00:45:57.333 --> 00:45:58.700
Ugh.

972
00:45:58.834 --> 00:46:00.967
I am so sorry.

973
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.367
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

974
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.600
- It's an accident.
- I am so sorry. I--

975
00:46:04.734 --> 00:46:07.100
Ronan:
An accident. It's okay.

976
00:46:07.233 --> 00:46:08.300
(footsteps pattering)

977
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.734
I need another dress.

978
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.533
Ronan:
What are we doing out here?

979
00:46:24.667 --> 00:46:25.767
(chuckling)
Ah. well.

980
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.266
the valet said it
was going to be a while.

981
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.934
so I figured that this spot
was the safest place to hide.

982
00:46:30.066 --> 00:46:33.367
No one's that upset in there.
Come on. It got a good laugh.

983
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.734
I ruined Brooke Hamilton's dress
in front of everyone.

984
00:46:36.867 --> 00:46:38.700
Brookie?
Well. she's already changed

985
00:46:38.834 --> 00:46:41.367
into one of her hundreds
of others.

986
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.800
Okay. It didn't start with
just the dress.

987
00:46:42.934 --> 00:46:44.133
They've all been
looking at me like that

988
00:46:44.266 --> 00:46:45.433
ever since I walked
through the door.

989
00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:46.900
That's probably
because you're wearing

990
00:46:47.033 --> 00:46:48.300
that very bad T-shirt. Whew.

991
00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:51.033
Okay. Hey. Mr. Rock 'n' Roll.

992
00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:52.734
Rock 'n' roll.

993
00:46:52.867 --> 00:46:55.533
I did not know that you rocked
and rolled.

994
00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:57.700
- Got to rock out.
- (chuckling)

995
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.567
Look.
The Hamiltons can be difficult.

996
00:47:05.266 --> 00:47:06.900
They have their moments.

997
00:47:07.934 --> 00:47:09.166
But they're not always nice.

998
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.967
Yeah.

999
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.900
Nice would have been nice.

1000
00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:18.800
(sighing)
I should have known better.

1001
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.166
Then why did you come?

1002
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.266
Why do you think?

1003
00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:29.300
Yeah. Me. too.

1004
00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:32.300
Except you're not the world's
most eligible bachelor. Ronan.

1005
00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:36.033
You don't even realize it.
do you?

1006
00:47:37.066 --> 00:47:38.367
Or if you do.

1007
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.266
then you're just as bad
as your reputation.

1008
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.700
My reputation?

1009
00:47:42.834 --> 00:47:46.767
You have a reputation
with the ladies.

1010
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.133
Well. that's just the press.

1011
00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:51.800
and yes. I have dated a lot.

1012
00:47:51.934 --> 00:47:54.066
but that's because I haven't
found the right woman yet.

1013
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.166
Doesn't mean I'm not looking.

1014
00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:05.500
- (both shrieking)
- Oh. my gosh.

1015
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:07.266
(both laughing)

1016
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.166
- Woo!
- (laughing)

1017
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.066
Here. (laughing)

1018
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.767
- Okay. Okay. Let's go in.
- Woo!

1019
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.867
(laughing) Let's go.

1020
00:48:31.633 --> 00:48:34.066
Ronan:
Warming up?

1021
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.367
Yeah. finally.

1022
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.500
Is everyone else still here?

1023
00:48:40.633 --> 00:48:44.100
Uh. pretty much just everyone.

1024
00:48:44.233 --> 00:48:47.066
Is there a back door
that I could go through?

1025
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.433
Yes. but you'd have to
walk past several windows.

1026
00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:53.200
and your clothes aren't dry yet.

1027
00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:56.367
Not a party you'll soon forget.

1028
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.867
(groaning) Please.
Oh. do not remind me.

1029
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.934
You made it better.

1030
00:49:01.066 --> 00:49:02.300
Well. I'm glad that

1031
00:49:02.433 --> 00:49:06.133
I was everyone's entertainment
for the evening.

1032
00:49:06.266 --> 00:49:09.767
I am definitely going to
lose my job now.

1033
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.967
No. We both know
your boss can't fire you.

1034
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.600
You're the real reason
she's a success.

1035
00:49:14.734 --> 00:49:17.000
And people should know
who the actual genius is.

1036
00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:21.433
Well. I admit to
being the designer.

1037
00:49:21.567 --> 00:49:24.934
And I would love
to own my own shop one day.

1038
00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:28.166
But my job with Rebecca is
a part of the path.

1039
00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.333
She's not a terrible person.

1040
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:31.734
and I really couldn't do
what she does.

1041
00:49:31.867 --> 00:49:32.967
Which is what?

1042
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.767
Fit into this...

1043
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.767
...high-society world.

1044
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.800
Well. maybe it should be
the other way around.

1045
00:49:40.934 --> 00:49:44.300
People like them
trying to fit into your world.

1046
00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:46.734
No. My world is not
the kind of world

1047
00:49:46.867 --> 00:49:49.567
that should be on the cover of
magazines. Trust me. (chuckling)

1048
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.800
Lucky you.

1049
00:49:52.934 --> 00:49:55.300
Why are you so unhappy?

1050
00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:57.834
You're the royal prince.

1051
00:49:57.967 --> 00:49:59.834
Exactly.

1052
00:50:01.867 --> 00:50:05.333
When I was about eight.
I. uh--

1053
00:50:05.467 --> 00:50:08.233
I used to help my grandfather
restore antique furniture.

1054
00:50:08.367 --> 00:50:10.300
He used to say
that he needed something

1055
00:50:10.433 --> 00:50:13.066
that he could see
and touch and feel.

1056
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.400
You know. when
we restore something.

1057
00:50:15.533 --> 00:50:19.133
we're really restoring
part of ourselves.

1058
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.667
It was the thing that I loved

1059
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.934
most in the world.
before I was sat down

1060
00:50:23.066 --> 00:50:27.400
and told of
my noble obligations.

1061
00:50:27.533 --> 00:50:30.166
That's one of the reasons
why I like coming here.

1062
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.166
I can be myself.

1063
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.467
So you'd rather restore antiques

1064
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.166
than be the prince?

1065
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.967
(laughing) No.

1066
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.400
But I want to make sure
I'm doing something tangible.

1067
00:50:47.533 --> 00:50:49.433
Philanthropy. You know.
I've spent my adult life

1068
00:50:49.567 --> 00:50:52.400
dedicated to
humanitarian efforts.

1069
00:50:52.533 --> 00:50:56.500
things that I know will make
the world a better place.

1070
00:50:56.633 --> 00:50:59.633
I mean. it's the least service
that my life should attend to.

1071
00:50:59.767 --> 00:51:02.300
Well. to me.

1072
00:51:02.433 --> 00:51:05.400
that's the very definition
of being noble.

1073
00:51:08.433 --> 00:51:11.000
But aren't you're in a position
to do all those things?

1074
00:51:11.133 --> 00:51:13.166
I'm heir to the throne.

1075
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.834
I'll have other. more pressing
responsibilities.

1076
00:51:16.967 --> 00:51:21.367
What is the real reason
that you asked me to lunch?

1077
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.900
I was being spontaneous...

1078
00:51:24.033 --> 00:51:25.533
...in the moment...

1079
00:51:25.667 --> 00:51:26.800
...out of character.

1080
00:51:26.934 --> 00:51:29.200
Cindy:
Exactly.

1081
00:51:29.333 --> 00:51:33.967
So. be spontaneous.

1082
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.166
Be out of character.

1083
00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.900
Live in the moment.

1084
00:51:39.033 --> 00:51:42.633
No one can stop you from
living your life.

1085
00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:45.266
Not even the king or queen.

1086
00:51:53.967 --> 00:51:56.533
Excuse me. Ronan.

1087
00:51:56.667 --> 00:51:58.200
but Gerald has some people
he would like you to meet

1088
00:51:58.333 --> 00:52:00.233
for cigars in the parlor.

1089
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:03.333
Right. Um. well--

1090
00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:08.233
Don't go anywhere.

1091
00:52:08.367 --> 00:52:10.233
Plus. Virginia wants
you to spend the night.

1092
00:52:10.367 --> 00:52:11.767
- She insists.
- (chuckling)

1093
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.066
She can't wait to see
what happens in the morning.

1094
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.700
Julia:
I know he's asked you to stay.

1095
00:52:21.834 --> 00:52:24.900
but your van is ready
and waiting.

1096
00:52:25.033 --> 00:52:27.100
I think it's best if you leave.

1097
00:52:27.233 --> 00:52:30.367
Oh. Okay.

1098
00:52:38.433 --> 00:52:41.967
Thanks.

1099
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.633
Cindy. you know you make it
obvious to everyone.

1100
00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:48.133
I make what obvious?

1101
00:52:48.266 --> 00:52:50.767
Clearly. to everyone but you.

1102
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.867
I came here tonight
on business. That's all.

1103
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.467
Except you didn't need to be
here on business. did you?

1104
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.233
No. I guess I didn't.

1105
00:52:58.367 --> 00:52:59.567
I don't blame you.

1106
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.300
I'm not even mad. actually.

1107
00:53:01.433 --> 00:53:05.800
which is kind of weird.
because I should be. I think.

1108
00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:10.600
Thing is. certain feathers
just don't flock together.

1109
00:53:10.734 --> 00:53:12.967
You have a crush
on Prince Ronan.

1110
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.433
Who doesn't?

1111
00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:19.033
But don't fall for it.
You're going to get hurt.

1112
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:21.934
What do you really like
about Ronan?

1113
00:53:22.066 --> 00:53:24.767
That really isn't any
of your business. is it?

1114
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.166
You made it my business

1115
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.867
the second you pulled
that prank on me.

1116
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.367
You want to know
who went out of his way

1117
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.500
not to make me feel stupid
tonight?

1118
00:53:31.633 --> 00:53:32.867
Ronan.
because he's a nice person

1119
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.967
who feels crushed
under his family's obligation.

1120
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.266
He's been down
this road before. dear.

1121
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.767
Then he comes to his senses

1122
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.166
and realizes there's one
universal truth in his life...

1123
00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.600
...one day being king.

1124
00:53:47.967 --> 00:53:49.500
And not even the sweetest
little dove in the world

1125
00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:51.967
can change those feathers.

1126
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.633
I know you're not
going to believe me.

1127
00:53:53.767 --> 00:53:55.433
but I'm actually looking out
for you.

1128
00:54:10.066 --> 00:54:12.066
- Virginia: Cindy?
- Cindy: Oh.

1129
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.333
You're not leaving.

1130
00:54:14.467 --> 00:54:17.100
It's getting late.
Mrs. Hamilton.

1131
00:54:17.233 --> 00:54:19.667
It's Virginia. please. and yes.
it is very late.

1132
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.367
You should stay.

1133
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.667
I appreciate that.
but I do need to get home.

1134
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.934
Cindy.

1135
00:54:27.066 --> 00:54:30.934
some people in this family
like you very much.

1136
00:54:31.066 --> 00:54:33.400
Most people don't like you
at all.

1137
00:54:33.533 --> 00:54:36.033
but that has nothing to do
with you.

1138
00:54:36.166 --> 00:54:38.734
Now. in light of my
sanctimonious self-indulgence.

1139
00:54:38.867 --> 00:54:41.400
I am very particular about
the dresses I wear.

1140
00:54:41.533 --> 00:54:43.667
especially to a ball.

1141
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.100
So. I would like to see you
back here

1142
00:54:47.233 --> 00:54:49.333
to discuss said particulars.

1143
00:54:49.467 --> 00:54:52.000
Okay. Yes.

1144
00:54:52.133 --> 00:54:53.667
You know. it's very difficult

1145
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.934
to have patience
with other people's vanity.

1146
00:54:58.066 --> 00:55:00.133
It's so offensive to our own.

1147
00:55:00.266 --> 00:55:02.233
Good night.

1148
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.633
(ignition turning)

1149
00:55:27.767 --> 00:55:30.767
Cindy!

1150
00:55:32.934 --> 00:55:34.834
Cindy?

1151
00:55:34.967 --> 00:55:36.233
(door opening)

1152
00:55:38.867 --> 00:55:42.633
Come inside. Ronan.

1153
00:55:42.767 --> 00:55:45.800
What did you say to her?

1154
00:55:45.934 --> 00:55:47.900
Only what I had to.

1155
00:55:51.367 --> 00:55:52.567
(groaning)

1156
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.233
(something scraping)

1157
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:12.333
(scraping continues)

1158
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.200
You really do like getting
your nails dirty. don't you?

1159
00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:23.767
Not very fitting
for a future king. is it?

1160
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.433
Maybe it'll make you
the people's king.

1161
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.400
Peace offering?

1162
00:56:30.533 --> 00:56:32.467
Thank you. Yes.

1163
00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:37.700
Did you hear the news?

1164
00:56:37.834 --> 00:56:40.266
No.

1165
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.767
Your father is going to
step down from the throne

1166
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.400
at the end of the year.

1167
00:56:44.533 --> 00:56:46.734
Why didn't he call me?

1168
00:56:46.867 --> 00:56:49.333
The queen spoke to
Mrs. Hamilton.

1169
00:56:49.467 --> 00:56:51.500
Apparently. they feel it's
the only way to rein you in.

1170
00:56:51.633 --> 00:56:52.834
so to speak.

1171
00:56:52.967 --> 00:56:55.834
I'm not ready to become king.

1172
00:56:55.967 --> 00:56:57.400
Is it really so bad?

1173
00:56:57.533 --> 00:56:59.333
Uh. don't answer that.

1174
00:56:59.467 --> 00:57:03.934
I'm sorry you feel so obligated.

1175
00:57:04.066 --> 00:57:05.467
including with me.

1176
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.433
You've never felt
like an obligation. Julia.

1177
00:57:09.567 --> 00:57:13.400
But it was a lot of pressure.
and that was two weeks ago.

1178
00:57:13.533 --> 00:57:14.834
Things have changed.

1179
00:57:14.967 --> 00:57:17.333
They certainly have.

1180
00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:20.266
You were happy
at the dinner party.

1181
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.433
It was the first time I've seen
you laugh in a long time

1182
00:57:22.567 --> 00:57:23.767
that wasn't being
faked for the cameras.

1183
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.333
I like that side of you.

1184
00:57:26.467 --> 00:57:30.266
I just wish I was the one
that made you feel that way.

1185
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.266
Julia. I--

1186
00:57:42.767 --> 00:57:43.734
(beeping phone on)

1187
00:57:43.867 --> 00:57:47.600
(phone ringing)

1188
00:57:55.367 --> 00:57:57.500
I'm doing the right thing.

1189
00:57:57.633 --> 00:57:58.834
For who?

1190
00:57:58.967 --> 00:58:01.834
(Cindy sighing)

1191
00:58:01.967 --> 00:58:06.567
Hey. Cindy. It's Ronan again.

1192
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.867
I'd love to speak.

1193
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.300
if you can call me back.

1194
00:58:12.433 --> 00:58:14.033
Bye.

1195
00:58:14.166 --> 00:58:15.633
(beeping phone off)

1196
00:58:15.767 --> 00:58:19.467
Rebecca: Please. please tell me
you'll have them done on time.

1197
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.467
Well. it's going to be close.
but yes.

1198
00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.000
we're going to get it done.

1199
00:58:23.133 --> 00:58:25.800
Okay. Two days until the ball.

1200
00:58:25.934 --> 00:58:28.367
Final fittings are tomorrow.
After that dinner party fiasco.

1201
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.166
we need to exceed
their expectations.

1202
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.800
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

1203
00:58:35.934 --> 00:58:38.900
Let's put it behind us.
Water under the bridge.

1204
00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:40.567
All will be forgiven
when they see my work.

1205
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.000
(Rebecca laughing)

1206
00:58:42.133 --> 00:58:45.333
You know how I appreciate you.
all of you.

1207
00:58:45.467 --> 00:58:46.867
all your hard work.

1208
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.200
Your time will come. I promise.

1209
00:58:50.333 --> 00:58:52.033
Oh!
(snapping fingers)

1210
00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:53.834
I should have mentioned this
before.

1211
00:58:53.967 --> 00:58:55.400
I've been invited
to attend the ball.

1212
00:58:55.533 --> 00:58:57.500
No shock there. but
I wasn't sure for a moment.

1213
00:58:57.633 --> 00:58:59.867
You must come up with
something fabulous for me.

1214
00:59:00.066 --> 00:59:01.133
Another dress?

1215
00:59:01.266 --> 00:59:03.033
Rebecca:
Yes. of course.

1216
00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:04.633
It's for me.

1217
00:59:04.767 --> 00:59:07.567
I'll leave it up to you.
and I'll inform the Hamiltons

1218
00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.667
that everything
will be on schedule.

1219
00:59:11.533 --> 00:59:14.600
"Oh. and I should
have mentioned this before.

1220
00:59:14.734 --> 00:59:16.000
(chuckling)
Another dress."

1221
00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.567
We'll work around the clock
and we'll get it done.

1222
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.734
You'll make them look great.
There'll be no stopping you.

1223
00:59:22.867 --> 00:59:24.967
No. There never is.

1224
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.433
And tomorrow. officially.

1225
00:59:27.567 --> 00:59:30.934
you are all going to be on
a week's vacation. paid.

1226
00:59:31.066 --> 00:59:33.934
I don't want to see
any of you in this room.

1227
00:59:34.066 --> 00:59:35.100
especially you.

1228
00:59:35.233 --> 00:59:36.767
(laughing)

1229
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.734
And there'll be no stopping us.
either.

1230
00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:40.700
No. there won't be.

1231
00:59:40.834 --> 00:59:42.834
Love that blue.

1232
01:00:22.233 --> 01:00:25.433
Mmm. Oh. the chocolate
eclair is divine.

1233
01:00:25.567 --> 01:00:26.767
You must try that one. Mother.

1234
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.934
Mmm.

1235
01:00:28.066 --> 01:00:29.233
Hello. everyone.

1236
01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:31.133
(gasping)
The dresses.

1237
01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:32.734
Cindy:
Yes. There's still time

1238
01:00:32.867 --> 01:00:36.567
to do any more last-minute
alterations before tomorrow.

1239
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.033
We can try them on one at a time

1240
01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:40.400
and present them to each
other like a fashion show.

1241
01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:42.233
Can we finish with
the caterer first?

1242
01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:44.767
We'll only be a minute.

1243
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.567
Oh. yes. of course.
I'll go set up.

1244
01:00:51.734 --> 01:00:52.967
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

1245
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.533
(zipper rasping)

1246
01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:58.033
Hi there.

1247
01:00:58.166 --> 01:01:02.200
Hello.

1248
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.633
Any particular reason why you
haven't been answering my calls?

1249
01:01:04.767 --> 01:01:07.467
Oh. I've just been really busy.

1250
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.200
For a phone call?

1251
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:14.467
Look. I don't understand
why you keep on calling me.

1252
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.133
Your situation is very clear
and to the entire world.

1253
01:01:18.266 --> 01:01:21.633
You're going to be king. and...

1254
01:01:21.767 --> 01:01:24.467
...I really don't fit into
that equation.

1255
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.433
I thought we had
this conversation.

1256
01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:30.967
I just need to
concentrate on my work.

1257
01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.633
Yeah. Sure.

1258
01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:38.800
Might I see mine. at least?

1259
01:01:38.934 --> 01:01:41.500
Yes. of course.

1260
01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:43.166
Um. you said you
didn't want to look

1261
01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.367
too royal or too majestic. so--

1262
01:01:52.133 --> 01:01:54.166
It's exactly perfect.

1263
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.767
I'm glad.

1264
01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.533
You're a genius. Cindy.

1265
01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.800
Thank you.

1266
01:01:59.934 --> 01:02:02.333
I knew you were
a designer from the start.

1267
01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:04.834
- May I?
- Yes.

1268
01:02:04.967 --> 01:02:09.200
Well. I'll let the ladies know
you're ready when they are.

1269
01:02:20.467 --> 01:02:22.433
(sighing)

1270
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.600
(screaming)

1271
01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:40.900
No! Oh. no. Oh. no!

1272
01:02:41.033 --> 01:02:44.033
(panting)

1273
01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:46.600
(gasping)

1274
01:02:46.734 --> 01:02:48.867
What are we supposed to wear?

1275
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.033
I'm going to fix it.

1276
01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.600
- The ball is tomorrow.
- I'm aware of that.

1277
01:02:52.734 --> 01:02:53.900
This can't be happening!

1278
01:02:54.033 --> 01:02:55.767
I'm handling it.

1279
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.834
Mother. I am not wearing
anything from a store.

1280
01:02:59.967 --> 01:03:01.967
I'm going to handle this.

1281
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.500
Please. just don't tell
Mrs. Raslyn.

1282
01:03:04.633 --> 01:03:06.433
There is no time.

1283
01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:08.066
I'm going to fix this. Trust me.

1284
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.633
Cindy. it's not the end
of the world.

1285
01:03:16.767 --> 01:03:18.567
It's the end of my job.
It's the end of everything I--

1286
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.667
For what it's worth.

1287
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.500
the look on their faces
was priceless.

1288
01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.500
Julia?

1289
01:03:25.633 --> 01:03:26.567
Can I speak to you. please?

1290
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.900
One moment. please.

1291
01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:34.433
This whole thing with Ronan...

1292
01:03:34.567 --> 01:03:37.500
I want him to be happy.
I wasn't ever really after him.

1293
01:03:37.633 --> 01:03:42.066
I was after
what it would mean to have him.

1294
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.834
Suddenly. that doesn't
feel good enough anymore.

1295
01:03:44.967 --> 01:03:46.333
It's just hard for either of us

1296
01:03:46.467 --> 01:03:48.567
to get out from our own shadows.

1297
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.734
What do you think that
I should do?

1298
01:03:50.867 --> 01:03:54.600
For starters. fix the dresses.

1299
01:03:54.734 --> 01:03:55.767
if you can.

1300
01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.834
(chuckling)

1301
01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:00.467
I think the rest
will take care of itself.

1302
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.834
Good luck.

1303
01:04:15.667 --> 01:04:18.900
(phone ringing)

1304
01:04:19.033 --> 01:04:20.433
Rebecca! Hi.

1305
01:04:20.567 --> 01:04:23.233
Oh. no. no. no. I have
everything under control.

1306
01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:25.367
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. No. no. Uh. hello?

1307
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.066
Oh. I think we have
a bad connection.

1308
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.600
Hello? I can't hear you. Hello?

1309
01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:31.066
(beeping phone off)

1310
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.567
Okay. Cindy.

1311
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.533
You've got this. Woo!

1312
01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:36.233
We got this.

1313
01:04:36.367 --> 01:04:38.767
Ronan.

1314
01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.834
What are you doing here?

1315
01:04:40.967 --> 01:04:43.166
First. just to see
if you were all right.

1316
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.066
Yeah. I'm fine.

1317
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.333
No. no. I'm not fine.

1318
01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.734
We ran out of fabric
for the original dresses.

1319
01:04:48.867 --> 01:04:50.400
so I have to use
what I have in stock here.

1320
01:04:50.533 --> 01:04:53.567
which meant all-new designs.

1321
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.166
You just designed
four new dresses?

1322
01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.834
Cindy:
Yes.

1323
01:04:56.967 --> 01:04:58.567
That's amazing.

1324
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.600
Where's Rebecca?

1325
01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:02.166
Well. she's in New England.

1326
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.900
She won't be back
until tomorrow.

1327
01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.967
Right. The rest of your staff?

1328
01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.633
They're on vacation.

1329
01:05:07.767 --> 01:05:09.500
- Then it's just me and you.
- Uh--

1330
01:05:09.633 --> 01:05:11.633
I don't know anything

1331
01:05:11.767 --> 01:05:14.000
about fashion
or sewing or any of this.

1332
01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:16.900
but if I can restore things
with my hands.

1333
01:05:17.033 --> 01:05:18.233
I'm sure I can be of some help.

1334
01:05:18.367 --> 01:05:22.600
Okay.
Let's put you to work. then.

1335
01:05:22.734 --> 01:05:25.667
Right. So. uh. the ball is
at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow?

1336
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.567
Yes. Right.

1337
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.000
The ladies will need.
what. 30 minutes to get ready?

1338
01:05:30.133 --> 01:05:31.300
Two hours.

1339
01:05:31.433 --> 01:05:32.934
Two hours? Okay.

1340
01:05:33.066 --> 01:05:36.000
It's just after 6:00.
which gives us almost--

1341
01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.667
Reggie:
24 hours.

1342
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.500
Cindy:
Reggie! (laughing)

1343
01:05:39.633 --> 01:05:41.734
Wait. What are you doing here?

1344
01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:43.266
Rebecca texted me in a panic.

1345
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.767
I thought that
you were on vacation.

1346
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.000
I haven't started
my vacation yet.

1347
01:05:48.133 --> 01:05:50.333
Or am I interrupting something?

1348
01:05:51.734 --> 01:05:54.133
- No. no. Just--
- No. not at all. I mean.

1349
01:05:54.266 --> 01:05:55.166
you know. and besides.

1350
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.600
all hands on deck.
as they say.

1351
01:05:56.734 --> 01:05:58.300
Oh. Tell us what to do.

1352
01:05:58.433 --> 01:06:00.633
Well. let's lay out the fabric.

1353
01:06:00.767 --> 01:06:04.166
- Okay. See this drawing here?
- Mm-hmm.

1354
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.734
Okay. So. I have it
sketched out. So. take this.

1355
01:06:13.033 --> 01:06:15.166
You fully understand. right?

1356
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.633
- Of course.
- Okay.

1357
01:06:17.767 --> 01:06:19.033
(speaking indistinctly)

1358
01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:22.300
Do this. Go around. and then
you're going to pin each--

1359
01:06:22.433 --> 01:06:24.400
Okay. Perfect.

1360
01:06:27.633 --> 01:06:29.200
Okay.

1361
01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:31.066
Oh. Okay. There you go.

1362
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.333
Sure. Use me as a model.

1363
01:06:32.467 --> 01:06:34.333
(Cindy laughing)

1364
01:06:34.467 --> 01:06:36.567
Go on.

1365
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.667
That's my--
That's my other tie.

1366
01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.500
I'm going to wear this as a tie.

1367
01:06:40.633 --> 01:06:43.133
The green.

1368
01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:52.967
(whispering)
Ronan.

1369
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.533
Ronan?
Oh. I know these are very--

1370
01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:57.367
- No. it's all right. I'm good.
- Long hours.

1371
01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.400
- I've got this. It's all right.
- Yes. The time change. too.

1372
01:06:59.533 --> 01:07:02.734
Okay.
Now. this dress--

1373
01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:04.266
That looks good.

1374
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.967
Okay.

1375
01:07:10.266 --> 01:07:14.233
(phone ringing)

1376
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.100
Hello?

1377
01:07:21.233 --> 01:07:24.033
- Gloria: Ronan.
- Gloria.

1378
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:26.133
Where are you?

1379
01:07:26.266 --> 01:07:28.600
What time is it?

1380
01:07:28.734 --> 01:07:30.867
6:05.

1381
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.800
Nobody can get a hold of anyone.

1382
01:07:32.934 --> 01:07:35.867
Cindy. Rebecca--

1383
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.400
No one is answering their phone.

1384
01:07:38.533 --> 01:07:40.467
We are in a panic here. Ronan.

1385
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.767
I'm going to call you back.

1386
01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.066
Oh. jeez.

1387
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.266
Wake up. Cindy.

1388
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.033
Who eats pineapple pizza?
(chuckling)

1389
01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.133
Cindy. it's after 6:00.

1390
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.066
Reggie. it's after 6:00.

1391
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.000
- After 6:00?
- (Cindy moaning)

1392
01:08:01.133 --> 01:08:03.867
I have a dozen missed calls
from Rebecca.

1393
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.800
Oh. no. Oh. no. no.

1394
01:08:05.934 --> 01:08:06.967
(panting)

1395
01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.433
Rebecca. hi.

1396
01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:11.467
Cindy. don't hang up. It's me.

1397
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.266
Cindy. please.

1398
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.433
Please tell me you got it done.

1399
01:08:15.567 --> 01:08:17.533
Yes. Yes. we got it done.

1400
01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:20.767
Oh. I don't want to call
until I know what to tell them.

1401
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.600
Are you at the estate?

1402
01:08:22.734 --> 01:08:26.200
- Can you speak up?
- We are on our way.

1403
01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:28.834
You're on your way? "Our way"?
Who's with you?

1404
01:08:28.967 --> 01:08:31.100
I'll see you there. Bye.

1405
01:08:31.233 --> 01:08:34.000
Uh. hello? Hello?

1406
01:08:34.133 --> 01:08:35.033
Oh. no.

1407
01:08:35.166 --> 01:08:36.433
We actually got it done?

1408
01:08:36.567 --> 01:08:37.867
I wasn't just dreaming that.
right?

1409
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.133
- We finished.
- Ah.

1410
01:08:39.266 --> 01:08:41.633
Nothing can go wrong now. right?

1411
01:08:41.767 --> 01:08:45.266
What could possibly go wrong?
Do you want me to come with?

1412
01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.600
Oh.
Um. if you could just help me

1413
01:08:46.734 --> 01:08:47.867
get the dresses
in the garment bag.

1414
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.133
- then you can be on your way.
- Okay.

1415
01:08:50.266 --> 01:08:51.834
I love you so much. Reggie.
You're getting another raise.

1416
01:08:51.967 --> 01:08:53.467
You know it.

1417
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.266
Okay. You did it.

1418
01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.200
I did it. Thank you.

1419
01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:00.400
- (Cindy chuckling)
- Um...

1420
01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:03.066
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1421
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.000
- Let's go.
- Yes. Oh.

1422
01:09:10.367 --> 01:09:12.333
Ronan:
I'll take two and you take two.

1423
01:09:14.533 --> 01:09:16.533
- Oh. perfect.
- Okay.

1424
01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:32.900
Well. all things considered.

1425
01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:35.033
I'm happy you're here.

1426
01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:37.000
Ronan:
Hmm.

1427
01:09:37.133 --> 01:09:38.100
Where were you all night?

1428
01:09:38.233 --> 01:09:39.900
Out.

1429
01:09:40.033 --> 01:09:42.333
- Out where?
- Does it matter?

1430
01:09:42.467 --> 01:09:43.667
No.

1431
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.734
Uh. why don't we get you
all dressed? Um--

1432
01:09:46.867 --> 01:09:48.066
- Yes.
- They should all fit.

1433
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.100
Nothing has changed.

1434
01:09:49.233 --> 01:09:51.000
You really did
all of this last night?

1435
01:09:51.133 --> 01:09:54.967
Yes. Up until the last minute.
literally. (laughing)

1436
01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.400
I guess I'd better go
get cleaned up as well.

1437
01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.200
Stay. At the very least.

1438
01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:07.333
you should see
these dresses on them.

1439
01:10:07.467 --> 01:10:09.767
Yes. at the very least.

1440
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.767
I'll be back.

1441
01:10:29.133 --> 01:10:31.100
(sighing)

1442
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.100
- Cindy?
- Cindy: Mmm?

1443
01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:52.200
Gerald:
Rise and shine. young lady.

1444
01:10:58.133 --> 01:10:59.433
(chuckling)

1445
01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:01.600
Cindy. wake up.

1446
01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.500
The ladies
are on their way down.

1447
01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:06.800
Oh.

1448
01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:08.066
Gerald:
You won't want to miss this.

1449
01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.100
(Ronan and Cindy chuckling)

1450
01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:13.066
Thank you. Ah.

1451
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.100
- Wow.
- (gasping)

1452
01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.266
- (applauding)
- Spectacular.

1453
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.233
- (laughing)
- Thank you. Cindy.

1454
01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.333
Brooke:
Oh. I look beautiful.

1455
01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:33.667
It's perfect.

1456
01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.967
Thank you.

1457
01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.500
Uh. where is Rebecca?

1458
01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:40.834
She deserves
all our praise and more.

1459
01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:43.100
I certainly hope
you stitched one together

1460
01:11:43.233 --> 01:11:44.333
for yourself. Cindy.

1461
01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.233
Oh. Oh. Oh. no.

1462
01:11:46.367 --> 01:11:49.066
This is your party.
and you look beautiful.

1463
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.166
You look stunning.

1464
01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.266
Oh. thank you. dear.

1465
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.400
I was somewhat partial
to the chocolate fondue motif.

1466
01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:56.567
but it'll do.

1467
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.934
All right. everyone. Photos.

1468
01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:01.133
Over here. Come on.

1469
01:12:01.266 --> 01:12:03.233
Gerald. come.

1470
01:12:03.367 --> 01:12:04.700
Right between us. please.
Hurry up.

1471
01:12:04.834 --> 01:12:05.967
- Yes.
- Hello.

1472
01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:09.500
- Come.
- (Gloria laughing)

1473
01:12:09.633 --> 01:12:11.467
(shutter clicking)

1474
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.900
(shutter clicking)

1475
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.834
(shutter clicking)

1476
01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:19.734
- I'll be right back. okay?
- Okay.

1477
01:12:19.867 --> 01:12:20.967
Rebecca:
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1478
01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.400
Traffic was a nightmare.

1479
01:12:24.533 --> 01:12:28.667
Rebecca. darling.
we are at a loss for words.

1480
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.667
Oh.

1481
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.633
It's the most perfect dress
I've ever worn.

1482
01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:37.133
Virginia: Yes. and mine makes
me look 20 years younger.

1483
01:12:37.266 --> 01:12:38.734
Or maybe that was the brandy.

1484
01:12:38.867 --> 01:12:42.567
Your choices are incredible.

1485
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.900
Ronan: Perhaps you should heap
your praise

1486
01:12:44.033 --> 01:12:47.633
on the person who actually
deserves the credit.

1487
01:12:47.767 --> 01:12:49.900
What on earth
are you talking about?

1488
01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:53.133
Ronan: It may say "Rebecca
Raslyn" in all the headlines.

1489
01:12:53.266 --> 01:12:55.567
but she is not the one
who designed these dresses.

1490
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.633
Ronan. don't. please.

1491
01:12:57.767 --> 01:12:59.400
I'm sorry. but that's simply--

1492
01:12:59.533 --> 01:13:02.033
Cindy is more than
just the head seamstress.

1493
01:13:02.166 --> 01:13:05.133
She is the genius
behind all of this.

1494
01:13:05.266 --> 01:13:06.767
How could you say such a thing?

1495
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.867
Because it's true.

1496
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.633
I watched her do it.

1497
01:13:14.533 --> 01:13:16.033
You watched her do what?

1498
01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:18.734
Sketch. cut. construct.

1499
01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:20.400
all of it. last night.

1500
01:13:20.533 --> 01:13:23.400
so that you all
could look so incredible.

1501
01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.266
You were with her last night?

1502
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.266
Yes. I was.

1503
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.800
I helped. Sort of.

1504
01:13:31.934 --> 01:13:34.266
It was a privilege
to watch you work.

1505
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.967
She deserves recognition.
Ms. Raslyn.

1506
01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.700
At the very least.
a little gratitude.

1507
01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:44.734
Rebecca. this can't be true.

1508
01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:48.600
I built a world-renowned brand
from the ground up.

1509
01:13:48.734 --> 01:13:50.900
and I take great pride in that.

1510
01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:52.533
But for the last five years.

1511
01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:55.567
the credit for this
goes to Cindy.

1512
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:59.533
This is long overdue.
young lady.

1513
01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:01.667
I am so confused.

1514
01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.133
You mean she is actually
Rebecca Raslyn?

1515
01:14:05.266 --> 01:14:06.867
No. not literally.

1516
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.433
But for all practical purposes.

1517
01:14:09.567 --> 01:14:12.000
she certainly is.

1518
01:14:12.133 --> 01:14:16.600
You saved the day once again.
young lady. Bravo.

1519
01:14:16.734 --> 01:14:19.100
- Bravo. (laughing)
- (Julia applauding)

1520
01:14:20.433 --> 01:14:23.367
Well. this is a shock.

1521
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.333
All right. everyone.

1522
01:14:25.467 --> 01:14:27.700
The guests will be arriving
any minute. Ronan?

1523
01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:30.133
We have much to discuss
before they get here.

1524
01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:33.033
The press will want
to know your reaction

1525
01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:37.667
- to the king's decision.
- Thank you.

1526
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.100
You've bided your time
long enough.

1527
01:14:40.233 --> 01:14:43.967
And I don't want to lose you.

1528
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.500
What would you say to
becoming my partner?

1529
01:14:47.633 --> 01:14:49.200
(both laughing)

1530
01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:51.166
Uh. really? Your partner?

1531
01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.767
Well. after tonight.

1532
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.367
my house is going to be
more prestigious than ever.

1533
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.300
- Deal.
- (shrieking)

1534
01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:58.367
(both laughing)

1535
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.433
Thank you so much. Rebecca.

1536
01:15:01.567 --> 01:15:03.500
- Go.
- Okay.

1537
01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:06.400
Coming. Yoo-hoo! Wait for me.

1538
01:15:06.533 --> 01:15:08.500
Yes.

1539
01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:14.367
Gloria:
Let it go.

1540
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.033
Is that by order of the queen?

1541
01:15:16.166 --> 01:15:19.000
Yes. and I agree.

1542
01:15:19.133 --> 01:15:21.533
You've been like a son to me
all these years. Ronan.

1543
01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:25.200
I'm looking out for you.

1544
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:27.200
Is it because she doesn't meet
the royal standard?

1545
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:31.066
You can't just fall in love

1546
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.166
with a common American girl.

1547
01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.667
She's not common at all.

1548
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.767
I've heard you say that before.

1549
01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.166
This time. it's different.

1550
01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.367
I'm responsible for you here.

1551
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.333
I gave your mother my word.

1552
01:15:46.467 --> 01:15:48.767
And yes. she's a lovely girl.

1553
01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.000
but not quite the mold.

1554
01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.667
And like it or not.
that's the world we live in.

1555
01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.500
but the same world
that you will soon have

1556
01:15:58.633 --> 01:16:01.767
other. more pressing
responsibilities.

1557
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:06.734
Well. I guess I was just feeling
impulsive.

1558
01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:11.567
out of character. spontaneous.

1559
01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.667
Try being a good member
of the royal family instead.

1560
01:16:21.133 --> 01:16:23.100
Who else could I possibly be?

1561
01:16:33.533 --> 01:16:43.500
♪

1562
01:17:01.166 --> 01:17:04.133
You can't be a wallflower
as king.

1563
01:17:04.266 --> 01:17:05.367
They'll never allow it.

1564
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.500
When I am king.
I'm going to sign it into law

1565
01:17:08.633 --> 01:17:11.066
that if the king
doesn't want to dance.

1566
01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.333
he doesn't have to dance.

1567
01:17:12.467 --> 01:17:14.633
Then it's going to get awkward.

1568
01:17:14.767 --> 01:17:16.734
I think we're expected
to cut a rug.

1569
01:17:16.867 --> 01:17:20.000
Yeah. We'll have to
cut something. anyway.

1570
01:17:20.133 --> 01:17:23.700
How come you didn't tell me
how you felt about everything?

1571
01:17:23.834 --> 01:17:26.133
Because you didn't want to
hear it.

1572
01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:27.567
I suppose you're right.

1573
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:31.533
Um. nothing happened
between me and Cindy.

1574
01:17:31.667 --> 01:17:33.066
Yes. it did.

1575
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.567
It's been happening for
a while now.

1576
01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.133
I think you just might be
in love with her.

1577
01:17:37.266 --> 01:17:40.400
- Julia. please. I--
- It's all right.

1578
01:17:40.533 --> 01:17:42.533
It's not like I've been
completely counting on

1579
01:17:42.667 --> 01:17:44.500
this arrangement. either.

1580
01:17:44.633 --> 01:17:49.233
I mean. I wanted it. true.
but for different reasons.

1581
01:17:49.367 --> 01:17:51.533
I see now
how different we are.

1582
01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:55.967
If I'm being honest.
I had felt a bit obliged to it.

1583
01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.567
Stop worrying about tradition
and what everyone thinks.

1584
01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.533
You sound like Cindy.

1585
01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:03.400
Then she must be
in love with you. too.

1586
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:08.033
Ronan. you're a great man.

1587
01:18:08.166 --> 01:18:11.233
I'm just
a different kind of person.

1588
01:18:11.367 --> 01:18:14.867
Less romantic. more practical.

1589
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.200
(chuckling)

1590
01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:20.467
Now. there's a Hamilton
I could wrap my arms around.

1591
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.867
Who. Bill?

1592
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.967
Julia:
If he plays his cards right.

1593
01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.033
he's going to be president
one day.

1594
01:18:26.166 --> 01:18:27.734
and I always thought
it would be rather fun

1595
01:18:27.867 --> 01:18:29.400
to be the first lady.

1596
01:18:29.533 --> 01:18:31.100
And where does that leave me?

1597
01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:35.967
Happily ever after.
if you play your cards right.

1598
01:18:48.033 --> 01:18:49.200
Where on earth are you going?

1599
01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:52.400
Suddenly feeling
a bit impulsive.

1600
01:18:52.533 --> 01:18:56.300
Go for it. I won't tell
anyone where you've gone.

1601
01:18:56.433 --> 01:18:59.800
Thank you. Virginia.
Have fun.

1602
01:19:11.633 --> 01:19:13.633
(sighing)

1603
01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:18.767
- Man: Cindy?

1604
01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.867
Cindy?

1605
01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.066
Cindy!

1606

Ronan!

1607
01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.533
What are you doing here?

1608
01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.600
Aren't you supposed to be
at the ball?

1609
01:19:34.734 --> 01:19:37.567
Not without you.

Ah!

1612
01:19:53.967 --> 01:19:55.934
Good evening.

1613
01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.667
- Hello. darling.
- Mrs. Hamilton.

1614
01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.100
you're out-dancing
everyone half your age.

1615
01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.867
Age is a number they put on
your death certificate.

1616
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.400
- Youth is a state of mind.

No.

This is just the beginning.
