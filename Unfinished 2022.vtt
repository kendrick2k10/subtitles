3
00:00:14.758 --> 00:00:16.793
- It was
the hottest day of the year

4
00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:20.275
as I drove through the winding
roads of Topanga Canyon.

5
00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:24.034
The sun rose and
disappeared over the crest

6
00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:26.034
of the towering mountain ridge.

7
00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:32.655
- Again?

8
00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.275
Just take a hot shower.
baby. It'll relax you.

9
00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:04.551
You okay?

10
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:08.379
- I'm fine.

11
00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:10.827
- Same dream?

12
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:18.689
I'm sorry. baby. Hey.
I'm here. I'm here.

13
00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:25.275
- You didn't know what you
were getting yourself into

14
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.724
when you asked me to marry you.

15
00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:33.482
- I knew exactly what
I was getting into.

16
00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:35.448
and I love every bit of it.

17
00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.793
Are you sure you're okay?

18
00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:48.482
- I am now.

19
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.517
- Good. because
that's all I want.

20
00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.655
- Are you sure
that's all you want?

21
00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:29.206
- Hey.

22
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:29.896
- Hey.

23
00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.275
So I been thinking?

24
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.724
- What?

25
00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:42.689
- This idea of you finishing
your father's novel.

26
00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:43.862
Think it's a good idea?

27
00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.103
- Dr. Gooden thinks
it'll bring me closure.

28
00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:51.931
- He was your father's
psychiatrist. and
now he's yours.

29
00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:53.758
That's not weird?

30
00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:55.413
- So now you have
a problem with him?

31
00:02:57.827 --> 00:02:59.413
- Not really. he
digs my photography.

32
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.827
- That's the only
reason you like him.

33
00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:08.344
- You didn't even know
him until your dad died.

34
00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.758
And if he wasn't the executor
of your father's will.

35
00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:11.965
you still wouldn't know him.

36
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.965
That's a conflict of interest.

37
00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.620
- And I've been seeing
him for over a year. Drew.

38
00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:20.827
So now you bring this up?

39
00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:25.896
- I'm just worried all
this is stressing you out.

40
00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:29.758
Okay. your father just died.

41
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.551
Trying to finish this novel.

42
00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:32.724
That's a lot. Zora.

43
00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:33.862
- Life is a lot.

44
00:03:34.862 --> 00:03:36.793
I barely even knew my father.

45
00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:39.482
You never even met him.

46
00:03:41.793 --> 00:03:44.448
- We were together a few
months before he passed.

47
00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:46.344
Okay. you just met my
parents a few months ago.

48
00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.896
- That's because they lived
in North Carolina. Drew.

49
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:50.965
My father lived
in the same city.

50
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.000
Hopefully. he didn't
blow all his money.

51
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:07.241
- He handled his business.

52
00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:16.000
- My father was a
brilliant writer.

53
00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:18.931
That's all I'm giving him.

54
00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:29.310
I'm. uh. I'm meeting
Dr. Gooden later.

55
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:33.517
He said he has some
intel on the will.

56
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:35.862
We'll find out if he
handled his business or not.

57
00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.000
- Well. he left me
all I need already.

58
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:42.965
- What's that?

59
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:46.344
- You.

60
00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:49.896
- You are so smooth.

61
00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:53.586
Mm.

62
00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:57.586
Let's have a late dinner.

63
00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:03.931
- I'll be here. I have
a photo shoot. so.

64
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.758
- Behave yourself.

65
00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:12.862
- What's that supposed to mean?

66
00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:13.896
- Mm-hm.

67
00:05:26.758 --> 00:05:28.793
- So. same dream?

68
00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:33.620
Nothing has changed? You don't
notice anything different?

69
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:39.896
- Well. like. uh. last night.

70
00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:43.517
I think the corpse
mighta been my father's.

71
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.965
- Really?

72
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.827
- Yeah.

73
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.551
- Zora. this may
be a breakthrough.

74
00:05:50.586 --> 00:05:51.413
- Closure?

75
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.482
- Perhaps. yes.

76
00:05:55.586 --> 00:05:56.448
- Closure to what?

77
00:05:57.931 --> 00:06:00.689
There's nothing open to close.

78
00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.620
- The conscious mind
is far less impactful

79
00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:06.793
than the subconscious mind.

80
00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:09.793
We aren't as free
as we think we are.

81
00:06:11.758 --> 00:06:15.034
And we're certainly not in
control of what we inherit.

82
00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:20.137
- Like schizophrenia?

83
00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:23.379
- Yes. like schizophrenia.

84
00:06:27.172 --> 00:06:29.620
Now this is information
on your father's estate.

85
00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:35.620
Your father was very well
taken care of by his handlers.

86
00:06:38.103 --> 00:06:40.137
There are two things here.

87
00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:43.724
First. the house in this photo.

88
00:06:45.827 --> 00:06:50.000
That is the first asset to clear
probate. so it's all yours.

89
00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:50.827
Free and clear.

90
00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:56.827
Free and clear.

91
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.517
So. maybe this will inspire
you to finish his book.

92
00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:08.206
- Is there a conflict
of interest here?

93
00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:12.137
Didn't the publisher pay
you to see my father.

94
00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:15.206
and now they're
paying you to see me?

95
00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:16.931
They also want me
to finish his book.

96
00:07:18.793 --> 00:07:23.172
- Your father requested that
I be the executor of his will.

97
00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:24.206
He trusted me.

98
00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:28.000
The publisher introduced
me to your father

99
00:07:28.034 --> 00:07:29.931
to help him with his illness.

100
00:07:29.965 --> 00:07:33.172
Your father paid me. and
it is in his will to pay

101
00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:36.448
for your sessions as need be.
so no conflict of interest.

102
00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:44.586
Now this is your father's file.

103
00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:49.241
In his will. he left
instructions to give you

104
00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:52.034
this envelope on the one-year
anniversary of his death.

105
00:07:57.793 --> 00:07:58.793
- This is where he died?

106
00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:01.586
- It is.

107
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.793
How are you feeling?

108
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.689
- Nothing.

109
00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:13.137
Nada.

110
00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:18.310
I don't want to own
my father's house.

111
00:08:18.344 --> 00:08:22.137
Everything he gives to me
turns to cash. post haste.

112
00:08:23.724 --> 00:08:24.517
- I understand.

113
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.275
I think if you read his
file it will help you.

114
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.137
- Why?

115
00:08:31.068 --> 00:08:32.655
Hm?

116
00:08:32.689 --> 00:08:36.172
The sooner I'm done with
this. the better off I'll be.

117
00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:38.206
Seems like he wanted
more to do with me

118
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:40.000
posthumously than he did alive.

119
00:08:42.034 --> 00:08:43.965
- Zora. you're drinking?

120
00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:47.275
- I'm fine.

121
00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:49.793
I have it under control.

122
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.000
- It's very important

123
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.793
that you are cognizant
of your disease.

124
00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.344
Alcohol does not help.

125
00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.310
It may trigger

126
00:09:05.034 --> 00:09:07.379
psychotic episodes.

127
00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:10.034
- I read all the warnings on
the sides of my medications.

128
00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.724
We all have our
stressors. Doctor.

129
00:09:15.758 --> 00:09:17.000
We all have our own comforts.

130
00:09:34.068 --> 00:09:35.275
Ah.

131
00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:56.137
Call Drew.

132
00:09:56.172 --> 00:09:57.965
- Calling Drew.

133
00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:11.310
- Hey.
you've reached Drew Long.

134
00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:13.275
If this is about a photo shoot.
please leave me a message.

135
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.137
Others. you know what to do.

136
00:10:17.862 --> 00:10:20.758
- I wish you would stop
leaving your phone on silent!

137
00:10:20.793 --> 00:10:24.344
Oh my God that annoys me!
What if I was stranded?

138
00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:29.689
I just. uh.

139
00:10:31.344 --> 00:10:32.310
I just don't know.

140
00:10:34.206 --> 00:10:36.068
I guess I'll see
you when I get home.

141
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.137
- That's amazing.

142
00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:44.034
Nice work. nice work.

143
00:10:44.068 --> 00:10:46.137
Yes. That's great. Briana.

144
00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:47.827
That's great. I love it.

145
00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:51.241
Yes. that's sexy.

146
00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:53.758
Great. great job. great
job. That's amazing.

147
00:10:53.793 --> 00:10:54.758
You look great.

148
00:10:58.206 --> 00:11:01.413
Wow. those are
amazing. You did great.

149
00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.206
Okay. change outfits for me.

150
00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:07.172
Bathroom's right
over there. okay?

151
00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:09.965
- I'll just change right here.

152
00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:26.379
- What the fuck?

153
00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:31.206
What the entire fuck. Drew?

154
00:11:31.241 --> 00:11:33.137
- Zora. relax.

155
00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:35.758
It's okay. Briana. it's
okay. It's just my fiancee.

156
00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:37.724
- Just your fiancee?

157
00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:40.206
I come home to my
house that I pay for.

158
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.103
and there's a half-naked
bitch in front

159
00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:44.793
of my fiance drinking wine.

160
00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.103
- I should probably go.

161
00:11:48.137 --> 00:11:49.206
- It's. no. it's okay.

162
00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:50.896
- Probably?

163
00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:52.379
- Zora. Zora.

164
00:11:56.344 --> 00:11:59.103
What the fuck?
Zora. she's a model!

165
00:11:59.137 --> 00:12:01.034
They change in front
of me all the time.

166
00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:02.000
- I bet they do. Drew.

167
00:12:03.896 --> 00:12:05.310
The problem is I caught
your sorry ass this time.

168
00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:08.000
- Zora.

169
00:12:08.034 --> 00:12:09.482
- Don't

170
00:12:09.517 --> 00:12:11.517
fucking touch me.

171
00:12:21.034 --> 00:12:22.413
- Zora. Zora. Zora!

172
00:12:23.931 --> 00:12:24.344
What the fuck?

173
00:12:46.172 --> 00:12:49.965

174
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.482

186
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.103
- You must be Zora Matthews.

187
00:14:37.103 --> 00:14:37.965
- Hello.

188
00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:40.586
- People call me Lorena.

189
00:14:41.655 --> 00:14:43.000
- Nice to meet you. Lorena.

190
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.000
- And I'm Beatrice. her mother.

191
00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:49.448
- Hello. Beatrice.

192
00:14:51.448 --> 00:14:53.586
- You are just like your father.

193
00:14:56.275 --> 00:14:57.103
- Thank you.

194
00:14:58.517 --> 00:14:59.482
I guess.

195
00:15:02.517 --> 00:15:03.344
- We should go.

196
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.172
I have things for
my husband's bar.

197
00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:19.655
You are just like your father.

198
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.034
- Dr. Gooden.

199
00:15:40.068 --> 00:15:42.344
- I got your message
about Drew. I'm so sorry.

200
00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:45.068
- I had to leave.

201
00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:47.517
I'm at my father's house.
so please don't tell him.

202
00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:51.655
- Listen. stress like this
can cause more psychosis.

203
00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:56.206
- No. I can't believe how
inconsiderate and selfish he is.

204
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:57.517
- Do you have your meds?

205
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:01.517
- Yes. I have my meds.
I always have my meds.

206
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:02.586
- You're taking them?

207
00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:04.655
- No.

208
00:16:07.448 --> 00:16:09.448
- Zora. listen to me.

209
00:16:09.482 --> 00:16:12.034
I'm sorry you're going
through this. I really am.

210
00:16:12.068 --> 00:16:13.413
- Yeah.

211
00:16:13.448 --> 00:16:14.413
- But you have to
take your meds.

212
00:16:17.724 --> 00:16:21.448
- You're right.
Yep. you're right.

213
00:16:21.482 --> 00:16:22.379
I'll talk to you later.

214
00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:23.620
- Please take your meds.

215
00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:25.310
- Mm-hm.

216
00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:43.068
Hello?

217
00:17:48.586 --> 00:17:50.758
- Miss Matthews. I'm
sorry. I'm the handyman.

218
00:17:52.448 --> 00:17:53.310
- You scared me.

219
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.482
- I'm very sorry.

220
00:17:56.344 --> 00:17:57.206
- It's okay.

221
00:17:58.862 --> 00:18:03.586
I'm Zora. but I guess you
already know me. And you are?

222
00:18:05.172 --> 00:18:06.551
- Amadi. My mother.
Alia. was here too.

223
00:18:08.241 --> 00:18:10.379
- She is here or was here?

224
00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:13.103
- No no. no no. she's
not feeling well.

225
00:18:16.758 --> 00:18:18.379
- How'd you know I was coming?

226
00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:20.827
- My mother told me.

227
00:18:22.793 --> 00:18:24.551
- How'd your mom
know I was coming?

228
00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:25.862
It was a
spur-of-the-moment thing.

229
00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:33.827
I'm sorry if I'm staring.
You just feel so familiar.

230
00:18:35.724 --> 00:18:37.724
- Your father often
told my mother

231
00:18:37.758 --> 00:18:41.724
that it seemed he lived here
before. like in a dream.

232
00:18:44.793 --> 00:18:45.620
- Yes.

233
00:18:47.413 --> 00:18:49.241
It all feels so familiar.

234
00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:53.413
- I was on my way to the master
bathroom. plumbing problems.

235
00:18:56.241 --> 00:18:59.413
- I can go with you. I
haven't seen the house yet.

236
00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:01.931
You can give me a tour.

237
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.344
Sorry. I'm just jumpy.

238
00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:58.655
New place. new start in life.

239
00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.827
- The house is ready
for you. Miss Matthews.

240
00:20:01.862 --> 00:20:02.689
I'll let you be.

241
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.965
- I'll. I'll go with you.

242
00:20:36.793 --> 00:20:37.793
Amadi?

243
00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.931
Amadi?

244
00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:04.517
Ama. Amadi?

245
00:21:51.413 --> 00:21:54.310
Excuse me. did you see
a guy come in here?

246
00:21:57.344 --> 00:21:57.931
- Vodka lime?

247
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.000
- Yeah. that's actually
my drink of choice.

248
00:22:08.137 --> 00:22:09.000
Thank you.

249
00:22:17.758 --> 00:22:20.068
How'd you know I was coming?

250
00:22:20.103 --> 00:22:23.655
Everyone seems to know
I was coming here.

251
00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:24.931
It was a spontaneous thing.

252
00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:28.586
- I met your father when
he arrived here too.

253
00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:31.931
I'm Eddie.

254
00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:38.586
So. what do you think
of our paradise?

255
00:22:45.103 --> 00:22:47.310
- Feels like I've died
and gone to heaven.

256
00:22:51.068 --> 00:22:52.310
This vodka .

257
00:22:55.068 --> 00:22:58.655
- So you really think it's
heaven? You sure about that?

258
00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:05.068
- Feels like I've been
here many. many times.

259
00:23:14.482 --> 00:23:16.655
That's quite a portrait
you have of my father.

260
00:23:17.827 --> 00:23:19.000
Did you know him well?

261
00:23:20.862 --> 00:23:22.482
- When he wasn't
writing or running.

262
00:23:23.758 --> 00:23:24.724
he'd come into the bar.

263
00:23:26.827 --> 00:23:28.758
- My father was a runner?

264
00:23:28.793 --> 00:23:29.862
- He ran all the time.

265
00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:35.000
He was a very impressive man.

266
00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:40.103
- Mm.

267
00:23:42.758 --> 00:23:45.103
I hate that I didn't
spend more time with him.

268
00:23:46.862 --> 00:23:48.620
He and my mother were estranged.

269
00:23:48.655 --> 00:23:50.655
so I didn't see him that often.

270
00:23:53.068 --> 00:23:55.689
- He talked about
it all the time.

271
00:23:57.689 --> 00:23:58.103
He felt very

272
00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:00.862
helpless.

273
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:10.172
- My father talked about me?

274
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:14.103
- Yeah.

275
00:24:15.931 --> 00:24:17.000
He was very proud of you.

276
00:24:18.758 --> 00:24:20.172
He said you were a
very good writer.

277
00:24:22.827 --> 00:24:25.551
Played the piano. ballerina.

278
00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:33.172
- He said that?

279
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.448
About me?

280
00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:40.517
- He said you were
following his footsteps.

281
00:24:42.068 --> 00:24:43.551
Like father. like daughter.

282
00:24:45.827 --> 00:24:47.896
He wanted you to fall
in love. like he did.

283
00:24:54.758 --> 00:24:56.517
- When was he in love?

284
00:25:13.655 --> 00:25:15.206
What do you want?

285
00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:17.689
- Why are you acting like this?

286
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:20.206
- Because I've finally woken up.

287
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:22.724
- Woken up? Zor. what?

288
00:25:22.758 --> 00:25:23.620
Where are you?

289
00:25:30.965 --> 00:25:31.793
Zor ...

290
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.827
- My fiancee. He upsets me.

291
00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:49.965
- All things come to a pass.

292
00:25:51.103 --> 00:25:51.965
Good.

293
00:25:52.793 --> 00:25:53.620
bad.

294
00:25:56.793 --> 00:25:58.586
Nothing lasts forever.

295
00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:15.724
- I come into my house. and I
find him and this slut model.

296
00:26:15.758 --> 00:26:18.206
She's half-naked. and
he's sipping on wine.

297
00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:21.137
So smug. so arrogant.

298
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.137
Anyway. fuck him.

299
00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:30.241
He's dead to me.

300
00:26:33.034 --> 00:26:35.344
Him and his slut
models who never pay.

301
00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:42.068
I'm building my portfolio.
It's all for my portfolio.

302
00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:47.862
You know. he's been building
his portfolio since I met him.

303
00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:55.068
Hey. whatever.

304
00:26:57.137 --> 00:26:58.000
To new beginnings.

305
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.034
- To new beginnings.

306
00:27:11.931 --> 00:27:13.103
- Ah.

307
00:27:41.448 --> 00:27:44.137
- I'm sorry. Miss Matthews.
I thought you'd be awake.

308
00:27:44.172 --> 00:27:45.724
I've still got some work
to do on the plumbing.

309
00:27:45.758 --> 00:27:47.379
- Stop calling me Miss Matthews.

310
00:27:50.034 --> 00:27:53.758
It's okay. Amadi. I
stayed up late. it's fine.

311
00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:58.275
- Your father was
always up early.

312
00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.275
I thought you'd be out on a
morning run like he always was.

313
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.344
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.448
- Stop apologizing.

315
00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.034
- It's just nerves. I apolo ...

316
00:28:06.068 --> 00:28:07.448
I mean.

317
00:28:07.482 --> 00:28:11.103
- Amadi. my head's a
mess. I drank too much.

318
00:28:11.137 --> 00:28:13.000
I need to get up
anyway and write.

319
00:28:14.137 --> 00:28:15.827
- Your father was a writer.

320
00:28:15.862 --> 00:28:20.000
- Yes. I know. He was
more famous than I am.

321
00:28:20.034 --> 00:28:24.137
And a better writer too.
But I have time. I suppose.

322
00:28:24.172 --> 00:28:25.482
- I never read his books.

323
00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:28.482
- Hey. if you see
me out walking all

324
00:28:28.517 --> 00:28:31.482
around the property.
I am not crazy.

325
00:28:31.517 --> 00:28:33.896
When I have writer's block
or need to think. I walk.

326
00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:41.448
You remind me of someone.

327
00:28:43.206 --> 00:28:45.172
Do you ever come
to Venice Beach?

328
00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:46.793
- No. I never left this place.

329
00:28:48.896 --> 00:28:49.965
You hungry?

330
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.310
- I'll be out in a few minutes.

331
00:30:44.379 --> 00:30:46.344
- Sorry. I didn't mean to ...

332
00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:50.965
- Stop saying
sorry all the time.

333
00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:53.517
- I disturbed you.

334
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:56.206
- No. you just walk so lightly
I never hear you coming.

335
00:30:56.241 --> 00:30:59.068
And I thought I heard
something coming from in here.

336
00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:03.931
- You know your father.
he often heard things.

337
00:31:03.965 --> 00:31:05.275
- What?

338
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.448
- He called them demons.

339
00:31:08.344 --> 00:31:10.517
- Like haunted house demons?

340
00:31:12.068 --> 00:31:13.586
- No. your father
understood them very well.

341
00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:15.965
I'm guessing you will too.

342
00:31:17.448 --> 00:31:19.655
- You know a lot
about my father.

343
00:31:19.689 --> 00:31:21.000
- My mother knew him well.

344
00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:26.586
It's a beautiful day for a walk.

345
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.000
Your father walked every day.

346
00:31:30.344 --> 00:31:31.172
- Amadi.

347
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.413
You dropped this the other day.

348
00:31:40.103 --> 00:31:40.862
- It's my mother's.

349
00:31:42.448 --> 00:31:44.620
- It's beautiful. You
should give it back to her.

350
00:31:46.206 --> 00:31:48.241
- It's not mine to give.

351
00:33:28.068 --> 00:33:29.724
- Everything okay?

352
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:30.586
- No.

353
00:33:31.758 --> 00:33:34.724
I was walking. and
something tripped me.

354
00:33:34.758 --> 00:33:36.103
grabbed me by my foot.

355
00:33:38.275 --> 00:33:39.551
- Did you see what it was?

356
00:33:40.827 --> 00:33:43.413
- No. It was the weirdest thing.

357
00:33:45.448 --> 00:33:47.448
I swear to God. I almost
had a heart attack.

358
00:33:49.482 --> 00:33:50.758
Maybe zombies.

359
00:33:52.379 --> 00:33:53.655
- No zombies in this bar.

360
00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.620
Your father had visions too.

361
00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:01.379
- Visions?

362
00:34:02.793 --> 00:34:03.827
- He took his medication.

363
00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:11.379
- I know.

364
00:34:12.758 --> 00:34:14.344
I'm supposed to take
my medication too.

365
00:34:28.517 --> 00:34:32.137
- Zora? You didn't
come home last night.

366
00:34:32.172 --> 00:34:33.758
And I'm worried
sick. Where are you?

367
00:34:35.344 --> 00:34:36.827
- None of your business.

368
00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:39.137
- Zora. you're being so
unreasonable right now.

369
00:34:40.586 --> 00:34:42.482
- You wanna talk about
unreasonable. Drew?

370
00:34:46.482 --> 00:34:47.310
- Zora!

371
00:34:51.827 --> 00:34:54.689
- To an automatic
voice messaging system.

372
00:34:54.724 --> 00:34:55.551
- Fuck!

373
00:35:00.793 --> 00:35:02.206
- Asshole.

374
00:35:04.241 --> 00:35:07.896
- Yeah. like father
like daughter.

375
00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:11.862
Your father had
relationship problems.

376
00:35:17.965 --> 00:35:20.379
- My mother said he
was a crazed maniac

377
00:35:20.413 --> 00:35:22.275
who didn't want
anything to do with us.

378
00:35:24.379 --> 00:35:26.413
I don't remember him
actually leaving.

379
00:35:26.448 --> 00:35:28.344
I just remember him
not being there.

380
00:35:30.724 --> 00:35:31.862
- Perhaps he had demons.

381
00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:37.275
- Hm?

382
00:35:47.413 --> 00:35:50.620
My mother said bad
things about my father.

383
00:35:50.655 --> 00:35:53.172
For all I know. she was lying.

384
00:35:53.206 --> 00:35:55.103
There's three sides
to every story. right?

385
00:35:57.758 --> 00:35:58.586
Never heard his.

386
00:36:00.344 --> 00:36:03.172
♪ Redemption glows

387
00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:08.413
Now that. that is beautiful.

388
00:36:09.965 --> 00:36:10.827
In a sad way.

389
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.172
- The singer is sad because
she knows her life must end.

390
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.517
- It's about suicide?

391
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.482
- Your father loved this song.

392
00:36:25.448 --> 00:36:27.724
He'd probably think
it's ironic now. though.

393
00:36:27.758 --> 00:36:29.275
- Why?

394
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.275
- His own suicide.

395
00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:36.482
- Suicide? He had
a heart attack.

396
00:36:36.517 --> 00:36:37.310
- No he didn't.

397
00:36:38.275 --> 00:36:38.931
- What?

398
00:36:42.482 --> 00:36:44.344
How did he die?

399
00:36:44.379 --> 00:36:46.896
- In the tub. In your house.

400
00:36:50.344 --> 00:36:54.275
- Why would they say
he had a heart attack?

401
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.793
- I've said too much already.

402
00:36:55.827 --> 00:36:57.827
- No. you need to tell me more.

403
00:37:12.517 --> 00:37:13.517
- It's late. Zora.

404
00:37:16.344 --> 00:37:17.413
Why are you still here?

405
00:37:20.034 --> 00:37:23.379
You're coming to
destroy our lives.

406
00:37:23.413 --> 00:37:24.896
just the way your father did.

407
00:37:27.344 --> 00:37:30.862
- When Lorena says we're
closed. we're closed.

408
00:37:33.034 --> 00:37:34.689
Good night. Zora.

409
00:38:15.586 --> 00:38:17.310
- Where are my pills?

410
00:38:20.482 --> 00:38:21.482
Amadi!

411
00:39:18.068 --> 00:39:20.655
- Zora. are you looking for me?

412
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:25.896
- I. uh. couldn't
find my medication.

413
00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:27.448
I thought you might
have moved it.

414
00:39:28.758 --> 00:39:31.724
Then I heard a woman
singing. voice.

415
00:39:32.827 --> 00:39:34.137
Was that you playing the piano?

416
00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:36.827
- There are no women here.

417
00:39:36.862 --> 00:39:37.689
No piano.

418
00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:43.000
- I heard it. I
swear. clear as day.

419
00:39:44.655 --> 00:39:45.620
- The demons.

420
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.482
- The demons? But
it was so beautiful.

421
00:39:55.172 --> 00:39:57.689
- Can I help you
find your medication?

422
00:39:57.724 --> 00:39:59.379
- No. I already found it.

423
00:40:02.206 --> 00:40:06.551
Amadi. I have really
bad psychotic dreams.

424
00:40:06.586 --> 00:40:08.620
and stress brings them on.

425
00:40:08.655 --> 00:40:11.034
- I'm always here to
talk if you need me.

426
00:40:11.068 --> 00:40:13.000
Just think of me as
your big brother.

427
00:40:16.172 --> 00:40:17.620
Good night. Zora.

428
00:40:19.206 --> 00:40:20.034
- Good night.

429
00:40:33.137 --> 00:40:34.655
- You have reached
the office of Dr. Gooden.

430
00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:36.965
If this is an emergency.
please call 911.

431
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.758
If not. leave me a message.

432
00:40:40.724 --> 00:40:43.793
- Hey. it's Zora. I need to
talk to you about my father.

433
00:40:43.827 --> 00:40:46.034
Now I heard he did not
have a heart attack.

434
00:40:46.068 --> 00:40:48.000
and I know that's
the company line.

435
00:40:48.034 --> 00:40:49.655
but I need to know the truth.

436
00:41:03.965 --> 00:41:06.241
- Didn't see you this morning.

437
00:41:06.275 --> 00:41:07.931
- Yeah. I came to
work on some plumbing.

438
00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:10.793
but you were asleep with
a book on your chest.

439
00:41:10.827 --> 00:41:12.724
Figured I'd come
back and work later.

440
00:41:12.758 --> 00:41:16.620
- Yeah. I was reading
my father's novel
he never finished.

441
00:41:16.655 --> 00:41:17.896
- Was it good?

442
00:41:17.931 --> 00:41:20.931
- It's interesting.
It's about this place.

443
00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:23.793
So a visitor. the protagonist.
he comes from out of town

444
00:41:23.827 --> 00:41:26.034
and he meets two sisters.

445
00:41:26.068 --> 00:41:28.517
And there's a love
triangle with another man.

446
00:41:29.827 --> 00:41:31.586
- A man in love with two women?

447
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.724
- Does that make you
feel uncomfortable?

448
00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:35.172
- Brings back bad memories.

449
00:41:35.206 --> 00:41:36.724
- Hm.

450
00:41:39.068 --> 00:41:40.586
Do you hear that?

451
00:42:00.137 --> 00:42:04.103
- Zora? Hey. the
information is in the file.

452
00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:06.275
Your father's file. the
one I told you to read.

453
00:42:08.793 --> 00:42:09.620
Zora?

454
00:42:11.103 --> 00:42:11.965
Zora?

455
00:42:12.793 --> 00:42:14.620
- I'm here.

456
00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:17.241
- As you know. before
your father's death.

457
00:42:17.275 --> 00:42:18.931
his last book. "Running
With the Bulls."

458
00:42:18.965 --> 00:42:20.620
was being published.

459
00:42:20.655 --> 00:42:22.137
Now they spent a lotta
money marketing it.

460
00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:24.206
It's gonna be
another bestseller.

461
00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:27.137
Now they felt that
if it became public.

462
00:42:27.172 --> 00:42:29.620
the book would lose millions.

463
00:42:29.655 --> 00:42:31.793
- So he did kill himself?

464
00:42:31.827 --> 00:42:32.689
- Unfortunately. yes.

465
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.206
They paid off the right people
to keep it out of the press.

466
00:42:37.931 --> 00:42:39.241
- So it was all a lie?

467
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.827
- Zora. I'm sorry.

468
00:42:41.862 --> 00:42:43.206
I know that this is a
lot to take in. but--

469
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:10.689
- So my father did kill himself.

470
00:43:12.241 --> 00:43:14.206
- I shouldn't have
said anything.

471
00:43:16.379 --> 00:43:18.379
- I don't understand.

472
00:43:18.413 --> 00:43:19.241
What happened?

473
00:43:21.103 --> 00:43:24.000
- Some things
just can't be explained.

474
00:43:31.758 --> 00:43:33.655
- Here again. Miss Matthews?

475
00:43:35.068 --> 00:43:36.586
- She's upset about her father.

476
00:43:37.413 --> 00:43:40.655
- Yes. I'm sure she is.

477
00:43:44.724 --> 00:43:46.206
It's time for you
to come with me.

478
00:43:49.206 --> 00:43:50.034
- Drink up.

479
00:43:51.655 --> 00:43:53.586
Lorena doesn't like when
things don't go her way.

480
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:55.137
- Amadi? Amadi?

481
00:44:56.965 --> 00:44:57.965
Amadi!

482
00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:13.965
- No.

483
00:46:15.413 --> 00:46:16.241
No!

484
00:46:52.965 --> 00:46:55.172
- Miss Matthews.
you're up early.

485
00:46:55.206 --> 00:46:58.000
- Hm. didn't sleep well.

486
00:46:59.413 --> 00:47:00.965
Guess I don't have
to tell you that.

487
00:47:02.655 --> 00:47:05.275
I am so embarrassed about
coming to you yesterday.

488
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.103
I'm trying to get it together.

489
00:47:09.137 --> 00:47:11.862
- Today is a day of salvation.
Tomorrow might be too late.

490
00:47:13.655 --> 00:47:16.586
- You're right. Amadi.
Today is a new day.

491
00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:13.310
Hey. hey!

492
00:49:06.482 --> 00:49:08.034
Why didn't you help me?

493
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:11.275
- Help you?

494
00:49:12.827 --> 00:49:13.655
Where?

495
00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:18.068
- Out on the path.

496
00:49:18.103 --> 00:49:19.275
I saw you.

497
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:20.724
You were with a man who
looked like my father.

498
00:49:20.758 --> 00:49:24.103
and my leg got snagged. again.

499
00:49:24.137 --> 00:49:25.620
and I was calling for help.

500
00:49:28.448 --> 00:49:30.000
- I haven't left the bar today.

501
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:33.413
You're seeing things. Zora.

502
00:49:33.448 --> 00:49:35.758
- No. I'm not. It was you.

503
00:49:35.793 --> 00:49:38.620
- Then I
must have a twin.

504
00:49:43.793 --> 00:49:45.551
- You weren't out on the path?

505
00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:52.241
- I haven't been on that
path in many. many years.

506
00:49:56.586 --> 00:50:00.724
- Eddie. I can't explain
the things that I'm seeing.

507
00:50:02.103 --> 00:50:03.620
- Some things just
can't be explained.

508
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.758
- Miss Matthews!

509
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:37.689
Sorry. Miss Matthews. I come
to work on the plumbing.

510
00:50:37.724 --> 00:50:39.482
- What happened in this house?

511
00:50:41.655 --> 00:50:42.758
- What do you mean?

512
00:50:45.482 --> 00:50:46.724
- When my father killed himself.

513
00:50:48.344 --> 00:50:50.275
- I don't know. Miss Matthews.

514
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:51.586
I only hear the stories
my mother tells me.

515
00:50:52.827 --> 00:50:55.482
- But you talk as
if you were here.

516
00:50:55.517 --> 00:50:57.275
It just happened
over a year ago.

517
00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:59.724
How would you know everything
about his everyday routines

518
00:50:59.758 --> 00:51:01.137
and nothing about his death?

519
00:51:02.551 --> 00:51:04.655
- Because she didn't tell me.

520
00:51:04.689 --> 00:51:06.620
- Weren't you the handyman here?

521
00:51:06.655 --> 00:51:08.275
- Yes. I'm always the handyman.

522
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.448
- Okay.

523
00:51:12.241 --> 00:51:13.827
Okay. well. what have you
heard from your mother?

524
00:51:13.862 --> 00:51:16.448
- I heard that he was wonderful.

525
00:51:16.482 --> 00:51:18.793
She loved him very
much. as he loved her.

526
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:20.758
- Loved him?

527
00:51:22.517 --> 00:51:23.689
And he loved her?

528
00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.517
- She was to be his wife.

529
00:51:29.827 --> 00:51:31.551
- Your mother was
engaged to my father?

530
00:51:33.103 --> 00:51:33.758
- Yes.

531
00:51:35.689 --> 00:51:37.103
- Did they ever get married?

532
00:51:38.482 --> 00:51:39.310
- No.

533
00:51:41.758 --> 00:51:43.275
- I wish I could
talk to your mom.

534
00:51:45.517 --> 00:51:46.827
- I need to finish my job.

535
00:52:19.586 --> 00:52:22.344
- Dr. Gooden. it's Zora.

536
00:52:23.448 --> 00:52:25.551
- Zora. how are you?

537
00:52:25.586 --> 00:52:27.862
- I don't know if this
is all in my imagination

538
00:52:27.896 --> 00:52:30.206
or if I'm having some
type of breakdown

539
00:52:30.241 --> 00:52:31.586
or in the middle of psychosis.

540
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.620
- I know that that
information that I gave you

541
00:52:33.655 --> 00:52:36.517
about your father would be
hard to digest. I understand.

542
00:52:36.551 --> 00:52:38.724
- I'm having bad dreams.

543
00:52:38.758 --> 00:52:42.896
The other night. I saw
a body in the bathtub.

544
00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:46.448
And when I was out walking
on the path. I saw my father.

545
00:52:46.482 --> 00:52:48.206
- I know he's dead. but I ...

546
00:52:48.241 --> 00:52:51.862
- Having a dream about
your father is not unusual.

547
00:52:51.896 --> 00:52:54.206
- But he seemed so real.

548
00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:55.827
- Is your father alive?

549
00:52:55.862 --> 00:52:57.206
- Of course not.

550
00:52:57.241 --> 00:52:59.896
- Then it was not real.
It was just a dream.

551
00:53:01.379 --> 00:53:02.724
Are there dead
bodies in the house?

552
00:53:02.758 --> 00:53:04.413
- Of course not.

553
00:53:04.448 --> 00:53:07.000
- Then why are you acting as
if you saw actual dead bodies?

554
00:53:07.034 --> 00:53:08.965
- Because they seemed real.

555
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.827
My father seemed real.
It all seems real.

556
00:53:13.517 --> 00:53:14.655
- Are you taking your meds?

557
00:53:17.448 --> 00:53:18.965
- I started again.

558
00:53:20.827 --> 00:53:24.482
- Understand your disease.
Zora. Tell me about it.

559
00:53:24.517 --> 00:53:27.758
- Schizophrenia is a mental
disorder in which people

560
00:53:27.793 --> 00:53:31.344
interpret reality abnormally.

561
00:53:31.379 --> 00:53:34.931
- And may result in a
combination of hallucinations

562
00:53:34.965 --> 00:53:36.793
and disorientation.

563
00:53:36.827 --> 00:53:41.000
- And behavior that can
impair daily functioning.

564
00:53:41.034 --> 00:53:44.793
- That's why taking your
meds is extremely vital.

565
00:53:44.827 --> 00:53:47.482
especially under
stressful situations.

566
00:53:47.517 --> 00:53:48.620
- You treated my father.

567
00:53:50.965 --> 00:53:54.275
Just because someone
has schizophrenia

568
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:56.827
doesn't mean they're
suicidal. right?

569
00:53:58.482 --> 00:53:59.931
- That is exactly right. Zora.

570
00:54:00.862 --> 00:54:03.758
In fact. your father
was terrified of death.

571
00:54:03.793 --> 00:54:05.689
- I need to know what
pushed him over the edge.

572
00:54:05.724 --> 00:54:06.758
- You need closure.

573
00:54:08.068 --> 00:54:10.689
This news about your
father is bringing on

574
00:54:11.655 --> 00:54:13.344
unnecessary stress.

575
00:54:14.724 --> 00:54:16.517
- How do I find closure?

576
00:54:18.862 --> 00:54:21.931
- Go to the path where you
saw him in your dreams.

577
00:54:23.068 --> 00:54:25.000
Visualize him.
Feel his presence.

578
00:54:26.413 --> 00:54:27.517
And let him know you feel.

579
00:54:29.068 --> 00:54:31.000
Let him know how the
estrangement made you feel.

580
00:54:32.034 --> 00:54:34.758
And then. find forgiveness.

581
00:54:35.896 --> 00:54:38.655
That is the key. forgiveness.

582
00:54:40.482 --> 00:54:42.034
- Forgive him?

583
00:54:42.068 --> 00:54:42.931
- Yes.

584
00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.517
- I gotta go.

585
00:56:08.724 --> 00:56:10.517
- Hey.

586
00:56:10.551 --> 00:56:12.517
- Morning. How was your sleep?

587
00:56:13.827 --> 00:56:15.793
- I slept. somewhat.

588
00:56:16.655 --> 00:56:17.482
Who knows?

589
00:56:21.034 --> 00:56:23.758
Amadi. do you have
a special someone?

590
00:56:23.793 --> 00:56:25.965
- Yes. my mother.

591
00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:31.517
- I'm going to make peace
with my father today.

592
00:56:35.517 --> 00:56:36.137
- Why?

593
00:56:37.689 --> 00:56:39.551
- I need to get
him out of my head.

594
00:56:39.586 --> 00:56:44.379
Been having bad dreams.
thinking about him too much.

595
00:56:45.137 --> 00:56:46.000
I need to start work.

596
00:56:47.172 --> 00:56:49.000
- I understand.

597
00:56:49.034 --> 00:56:51.827
- I'm taking a walk
on the walking path.

598
00:56:51.862 --> 00:56:53.827
Do you wanna come with me?

599
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:57.827
- To make peace
with your father?

600
00:56:57.862 --> 00:56:59.827
- No. to keep me company.

601
00:57:01.137 --> 00:57:02.172
- I'm here to help.
Miss Matthews.

602
00:57:02.206 --> 00:57:04.068
- Then please. come with me.

603
00:57:05.758 --> 00:57:06.620
- Where are you going?

604
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.724
Why are you taking Amadi
away from the house?

605
00:57:14.068 --> 00:57:15.896
- She's going to make
peace with her father.

606
00:57:15.931 --> 00:57:18.172
- It's your job to
work on the house.

607
00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.206
Is the plumbing fixed?

608
00:57:21.689 --> 00:57:22.517
- No.

609
00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:25.448
- Lorena?

610
00:57:26.931 --> 00:57:31.068
I'm sorry. I just wanted
Amadi to keep me company.

611
00:57:31.103 --> 00:57:34.000
- You shouldn't talk to
us about your father.

612
00:57:34.034 --> 00:57:35.551
- Why?

613
00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:37.103
- You ask too many questions.

614
00:57:38.586 --> 00:57:39.206
Too many.

615
00:57:41.241 --> 00:57:43.862
- I just need to find
out what happened to him.

616
00:57:43.896 --> 00:57:45.068
I need closure.

617
00:57:45.103 --> 00:57:47.034
- Your father is dead.

618
00:57:48.758 --> 00:57:50.034
What else do you need to know?

619
00:57:51.655 --> 00:57:54.620
- I know that. I need to
know why he killed himself.

620
00:57:56.965 --> 00:57:59.034
- Why do men do what they do?

621
00:58:13.275 --> 00:58:14.965
- What is she so angry about?

622
00:58:17.137 --> 00:58:18.275
- She lost everything.

623
00:58:21.103 --> 00:58:22.241
We know it's not
his fault. though.

624
00:58:23.862 --> 00:58:26.931
- What's everything? And
what's not whose fault?

625
00:58:26.965 --> 00:58:27.965
My father's?

626
00:58:29.827 --> 00:58:33.206
- The demons.

627
00:58:33.241 --> 00:58:34.275
- The demons?

628
00:58:35.965 --> 00:58:37.620
That's not an answer. Amadi.

629
00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:43.034
You need to stop
fixating on the demons.

630
00:58:43.068 --> 00:58:44.517
That'll just drive you crazy.

631
00:58:54.793 --> 00:58:55.793
This is so peaceful.

632
00:58:56.827 --> 00:58:58.793
- Yes. I've never noticed.

633
00:58:59.827 --> 00:59:01.000
- You know. that's so true.

634
00:59:02.379 --> 00:59:03.241
I need to focus
more on what I love

635
00:59:03.275 --> 00:59:05.310
about Drew instead
of what annoys me.

636
00:59:07.206 --> 00:59:09.172
- It's hard to see the
forest for the trees.

637
00:59:11.034 --> 00:59:15.724
- Up ahead. that's where
I first saw my father.

638
00:59:15.758 --> 00:59:17.000
Or at least dreamt about him.

639
00:59:22.413 --> 00:59:24.034
- I'll wait here for you.

640
00:59:42.172 --> 00:59:43.000
- Daddy.

641
00:59:46.034 --> 00:59:47.137
I'm hurting.

642
00:59:50.379 --> 00:59:53.931
It's the pain we share.
It's in our blood.

643
00:59:57.896 --> 00:59:59.068
I was so angry with you.

644
01:00:01.689 --> 01:00:02.862
I felt so alone.

645
01:00:05.896 --> 01:00:06.310
I still do.

646
01:00:12.206 --> 01:00:15.344
My mother would say these
hurtful things about you.

647
01:00:16.965 --> 01:00:19.172
and when she found out I
had the same illness as you.

648
01:00:19.206 --> 01:00:21.344
she would say the same
hurtful things to me.

649
01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:28.206
And it upset me. because
you were the only one

650
01:00:28.241 --> 01:00:33.034
who would understand
what I was going through.

651
01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:34.310
But you weren't there.

652
01:00:39.172 --> 01:00:43.310
Dr. Gooden says I need to
find forgiveness for you

653
01:00:43.344 --> 01:00:46.000
in order to find
closure. and I'm trying.

654
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I'm trying.

655
01:00:56.068 --> 01:00:57.310
And I believe it'll get better.

656
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.724
I only wish you had
believed the same.

657
01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:11.655
And I am sorry

658
01:01:13.827 --> 01:01:16.310
that I wasn't there to
help you through your pain.

659
01:01:38.793 --> 01:01:39.655
- You okay?

660
01:01:42.068 --> 01:01:42.931
You find closure?

661
01:02:35.206 --> 01:02:36.965
- What happened?

662
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.275
- Zora. you were sleepwalking.

663
01:02:39.862 --> 01:02:43.137
- There was a dead woman.
and she was after me.

664
01:02:43.172 --> 01:02:44.724
- There's no one
here except for me.

665
01:02:47.137 --> 01:02:49.275
- She was right there.

666
01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:51.827
She killed herself
in that bathtub.

667
01:02:51.862 --> 01:02:55.965
- Zora. it was a bad
dream. and I have them too.

668
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.827
You just need to rest.

669
01:03:05.551 --> 01:03:08.034
- You dream about
the dead woman?

670
01:03:08.068 --> 01:03:08.896
- Yes.

671
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.482
Just rest.

672
01:03:15.068 --> 01:03:16.172
- But the woman.

673
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:19.275
- You're safe now.
Zora. I'm here.

674
01:03:53.965 --> 01:03:54.793
- Bloody Mary.

675
01:03:55.655 --> 01:03:57.379
- Now you're
speaking my language.

676
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.517
- So. you're a writer
like your father?

677
01:04:04.517 --> 01:04:05.344
- I am.

678
01:04:07.517 --> 01:04:11.310
I'm actually working on an
unfinished novel he started.

679
01:04:11.344 --> 01:04:13.517
- Oh. What's it about?

680
01:04:15.965 --> 01:04:16.965
- Two sisters.

681
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:21.482
But the older sister is
married and the husband

682
01:04:21.517 --> 01:04:23.310
is in love with
the younger sister.

683
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.448
- I see.

684
01:04:30.103 --> 01:04:32.000
- Have you seen Alia?

685
01:04:34.482 --> 01:04:36.965
- What do you want with Alia?

686
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.103
- Well she was my father's
fiancee. I thought.

687
01:04:40.931 --> 01:04:43.931
- Lorena says you have made
peace with your father.

688
01:04:43.965 --> 01:04:45.517
- Yeah. I did.

689
01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:48.103
- Lorena says you ask
too many questions.

690
01:04:48.137 --> 01:04:49.241
- So what?

691
01:04:55.551 --> 01:04:58.586
- Curiosity killed
the cat. Zora.

692
01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:04.655
- I need to go write.

693
01:05:36.034 --> 01:05:37.413
- Hey.

694
01:05:37.448 --> 01:05:39.206
- Hey. I was thinking about
taking a walk. Wanna come along?

695
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:41.068
- Uh.

696
01:05:44.034 --> 01:05:45.241
I need to show you something.

697
01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:52.034
- Where'd you find this?

698
01:05:52.068 --> 01:05:55.206
- It fell out of my father's
book. Is that your mother?

699
01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:57.172
- Yes. why?

700
01:05:57.206 --> 01:06:00.000
- I need to know about your
mother. I need to talk to her.

701
01:06:00.034 --> 01:06:01.275
- No. that's impossible.

702
01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:02.655
- But your mother was
engaged to my father.

703
01:06:02.689 --> 01:06:04.206
She might know why
he killed himself.

704
01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:07.137
- There's some things
that cannot be explained.

705
01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:09.724
- His book is about two
sisters in a love triangle.

706
01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:10.689
- What's that story have
to do with my mother?

707
01:06:10.724 --> 01:06:12.103
- Did your mother have a sister?

708
01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:13.482
- Yes.

709
01:06:13.517 --> 01:06:16.137
- In the book. the
older sister's husband

710
01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:19.241
loves the younger sister.
but a visitor comes to town

711
01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:21.103
and falls in love with
the younger sister.

712
01:06:21.137 --> 01:06:22.068
and she's with him.

713
01:06:23.448 --> 01:06:25.724
- What's this story have
to do with my mother?

714
01:06:25.758 --> 01:06:27.448
- The husband becomes so enraged

715
01:06:27.482 --> 01:06:29.793
that he kills the
younger sister.

716
01:06:29.827 --> 01:06:32.310
- It's a story.
It's make-believe.

717
01:06:32.344 --> 01:06:36.241
- But the older sister kills
herself. and the book stops.

718
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.068
Listen. I need to
know if this book

719
01:06:39.103 --> 01:06:40.551
is based on a true story.

720
01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:48.241
We have to help.

721
01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:50.379
- No. he shouldn't be here.

722
01:06:50.413 --> 01:06:51.620
- He's being attacked.

723
01:06:51.655 --> 01:06:54.241
- It's not your place.
You shouldn't be here!

724
01:07:22.655 --> 01:07:24.482
- What happened?

725
01:07:24.517 --> 01:07:25.724

726
01:07:53.517 --> 01:07:54.344

The woman who died
in this house.

730
01:08:04.758 --> 01:08:06.724
- Zora. please
just sit and relax.

731
01:08:07.896 --> 01:08:09.551
- I can't relax.

732
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:12.551
That woman wants me dead.
and she is going to kill me.

733
01:08:12.586 --> 01:08:14.241
- Zora. it was only a dream.

734
01:08:16.724 --> 01:08:17.827
- What happened outside?

735
01:08:19.241 --> 01:08:19.896
- When?

736
01:08:19.931 --> 01:08:20.793
- Last night.

737
01:08:21.862 --> 01:08:22.896
- Outside this house?

738
01:08:24.103 --> 01:08:27.827
- We were talking about your
mother's photograph at the bar.

739
01:08:27.862 --> 01:08:29.724
- No. Zora.

740
01:08:29.758 --> 01:08:32.620
- Yes. yes. there was a man
on the path. and he was being

741
01:08:32.655 --> 01:08:35.241
attacked and I tried to save
him. and I turned him over.

742
01:08:35.275 --> 01:08:38.827
and it was my father and
it looked like he was dead.

743
01:08:38.862 --> 01:08:40.344
- Zora. it was a dream.

744
01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:45.241
- We didn't talk outside?

745
01:08:46.172 --> 01:08:46.827
- No.

746
01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:51.448
- We didn't see a
man being attacked?

747
01:08:52.896 --> 01:08:53.724
- No.

748
01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:57.724
- I am going fucking crazy.

749
01:08:59.965 --> 01:09:04.793
Dr. Gooden. this is Zora.
I'm in real trouble here.

750
01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:08.379
- Were you able to find closure?

751
01:09:08.413 --> 01:09:11.172
- Yes. I went to the place
where I saw him in my dreams.

752
01:09:12.034 --> 01:09:13.275
- Did you tell him how you felt?

753
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.620
- I told him everything.
but the dreams

754
01:09:15.655 --> 01:09:16.827
are still happening.

755
01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:18.448
As a matter of fact.
they're getting worse.

756
01:09:18.482 --> 01:09:21.344
I keep seeing this
woman coming after me.

757
01:09:22.724 --> 01:09:24.620
I think she's trying to kill me.

758
01:09:24.655 --> 01:09:26.517
- Do you know who this woman is?

759
01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:28.413
- It's my father's fiancee.

760
01:09:28.448 --> 01:09:31.344
Did you know he was
engaged to a woman here?

761
01:09:31.379 --> 01:09:34.413
- Yes. that's all in the
file that I gave you.

762
01:09:34.448 --> 01:09:36.620
Did you not read the file yet?

763
01:09:36.655 --> 01:09:41.000
Zora. I don't wanna
add more episodes

764
01:09:41.034 --> 01:09:43.448

I just need to talk to Alia.

768
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:55.448
and she'll help me put
together the pieces.

769

- Zora. you have to
listen to me. Alia--

770
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.482

- I can't leave my job.

780
01:10:44.862 --> 01:10:47.344

Look. I just wanna talk to Alia.

812
01:14:19.827 --> 01:14:21.137
Amadi said she was here.

813
01:14:22.586 --> 01:14:23.206
- Why?

- My father caused your sorrow?

817
01:14:39.103 --> 01:14:40.931
- He never should
have come here.

818
01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:45.896
- What did he do?
I don't get it.

819
01:14:47.758 --> 01:14:49.896
- He changed our world.

820
01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.862

821
01:15:00.137 --> 01:15:01.000

01:15:48.034 --> 01:15:49.241
Beatrice died of a broken heart.

827
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.241
- Broken heart?

828
01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:57.103
- You were on the path. you
fell down. I helped you.

829
01:15:59.275 --> 01:16:00.275
- That was last night.

830
01:16:02.206 --> 01:16:04.172

01:16:04.206 --> 01:16:05.724
Or maybe you need another one.

832
01:16:07.413 --> 01:16:12.206
- No. she was just

- Do I look dead to you. Zora?

843
01:17:23.896 --> 01:17:24.724
- Drew?

844
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:29.827
You're real.

845
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.137
- Of course I'm real. baby.

846
01:17:34.241 --> 01:17:37.241
- I've been having the
most horrible dreams.

847
01:17:37.275 --> 01:17:40.000
- I know you've been having
bad dreams. That's why I came.

848
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:42.310
- You came here?

849
01:17:43.206 --> 01:17:45.379
- Yes. to take care of you.

850
01:17:45.413 --> 01:17:47.965
I even brought you fresh
flowers this morning.

851
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.448
- What are you doing
here? How did you know?

852
01:17:51.482 --> 01:17:53.896
- Amadi said you fell
and knocked yourself out.

853
01:17:55.241 --> 01:17:56.275
He nursed you back to health.

854
01:17:57.793 --> 01:17:59.103
- She's having horrible dreams.

855
01:18:03.172 --> 01:18:04.482
- Dr. Gooden said I
should come and make sure

856
01:18:04.517 --> 01:18:06.517
you were taking your meds.

857
01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:08.275
He said you've
been hallucinating.

858
01:18:09.344 --> 01:18:10.965
- You met Amadi?

859
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:11.827
- Yeah.

860
01:18:14.344 --> 01:18:17.482

864
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:26.448
It was your psychosis.

Your father's home is. is
beautiful. It's amazing.

866

You know what we should
do? We should go on a walk.

01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:56.758
It'll make you
feel better. okay?

868
01:18:56.793 --> 01:18:58.172
Why don't you come meet
me out on the path?

- You never left here.

871
01:19:31.413 --> 01:19:34.206
- Beatrice told me
that Lorena was dead.

872
01:19:34.241 --> 01:19:36.551
and then Eddie told me
that Beatrice was dead.

873
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:39.482
- It's okay now. Miss Matthews.

874
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:43.000
- No. no. Beatrice is dead.

Come. Come see.

877
01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:55.448
There's Lorena. She's
not dead. no one's dead.

878
01:19:56.379 --> 01:19:57.206
You're sick.

879
01:19:59.068 --> 01:20:00.000
You should go join your fiance.

880
01:20:09.896 --> 01:20:10.517
- Amadi.

881
01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.448
- Your fiance is
worried about you.

882
01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:24.551
I wish my husband loved me
the way your fiance loves you.

883
01:20:28.862 --> 01:20:31.965
- I'm glad he came.
I'm a very lucky woman.

884
01:20:34.068 --> 01:20:37.206
- Yes. no more falling down.

885
01:20:39.206 --> 01:20:40.413
No more bad dreams.

886
01:20:43.586 --> 01:20:48.379
Amadi tells me that Zora
has nightmares. every night.

887
01:20:49.551 --> 01:20:51.379
- Yeah. Now I'll
take care of her.

888
01:20:53.068 --> 01:20:54.413
- We were all worried about her.

889
01:20:56.103 --> 01:20:59.172
We don't want her to ruin our
lives the way her father did.

890
01:21:01.344 --> 01:21:02.586
- The way my father did?

891
01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.620
- I have to go to
my husband now.

892
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:10.931
- Thank you for helping her.

893
01:21:10.965 --> 01:21:12.034
- Mm-hm.

894
01:21:24.068 --> 01:21:25.620
- I really fell?

895
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:28.137
- Yeah.

896
01:21:29.965 --> 01:21:32.620
- And I never went
to see Beatrice?

897
01:21:34.344 --> 01:21:35.379
- No.

898
01:21:40.103 --> 01:21:42.000
- I'm really going crazy here.

899
01:21:44.517 --> 01:21:45.517
- That's why I came.

900
01:21:47.241 --> 01:21:48.448
I'm sorry. baby.

901
01:22:11.586 --> 01:22:13.724
Dr. Gooden was
worried about you.

902
01:22:13.758 --> 01:22:14.655
- Just Dr. Gooden?

903
01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:17.931
- I was too.

904
01:22:19.551 --> 01:22:22.689
- Did he tell you my
father killed himself.

905
01:22:22.724 --> 01:22:26.000
and that he was engaged to
another woman. Amadi's mother?

906
01:22:27.689 --> 01:22:30.137
- Yeah. he told me everything.

907
01:22:30.172 --> 01:22:31.655
It musta been difficult for you.

908
01:22:31.689 --> 01:22:34.689
- Yeah. horrible dreams.

909
01:22:34.724 --> 01:22:37.689
In one dream. I'm
walking on this path.

910
01:22:37.724 --> 01:22:39.620
and then something
suddenly pulls me down.

911
01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:43.034
And then. in another
dream. I see a dead body

912
01:22:43.068 --> 01:22:44.379
in the bathtub. a woman.

913
01:22:45.724 --> 01:22:48.034
And then she starts
chasing me like

914
01:22:48.068 --> 01:22:49.551
some type of zombie fighter.

915
01:22:51.689 --> 01:22:53.137
- Those dreams are gonna end.

916
01:22:55.068 --> 01:22:55.931
- Promise?

917
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:01.000
- I promise.

918
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:20.758
- Oh. don't tell
me. This is Drew?

919
01:23:23.068 --> 01:23:25.413
Zora talks about
you all the time.

920
01:23:25.448 --> 01:23:28.310
She is very much
in love with you.

921
01:23:28.344 --> 01:23:30.103
You're one lucky man.

922
01:23:30.137 --> 01:23:34.034
One woman. one man. that's
what it's supposed to be.

923
01:23:34.068 --> 01:23:34.724
Right?

924
01:23:37.068 --> 01:23:38.551
- You still in love with me?

925
01:23:38.586 --> 01:23:39.413
- Yes.

926
01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:47.413
- Vodka martini?
How did you know?

927
01:23:47.448 --> 01:23:49.137
- Zora tells me everything.

928
01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:50.793
- Yeah. but I
didn't tell you ...

929
01:23:50.827 --> 01:23:51.758
- To us.

930
01:23:55.793 --> 01:24:00.655
- Beautiful necklace. But
it's not yours to wear.

931
01:24:01.482 --> 01:24:02.275
Is it?

932
01:24:04.482 --> 01:24:08.206
- I found it on Zora's
desk. I liked it.

933
01:24:08.241 --> 01:24:10.310
Thought it might add some
flair. Don't you think?

934
01:24:12.379 --> 01:24:14.517
Should I not have?

935
01:24:14.551 --> 01:24:16.827
- He gave that necklace to Alia.

936
01:24:18.689 --> 01:24:20.827
- Who gave that
necklace to Alia?

937
01:24:20.862 --> 01:24:23.793
- When he found out
she was pregnant.

938
01:24:29.206 --> 01:24:31.724
- Such a beautiful present.

939
01:24:33.517 --> 01:24:35.034
Don't you think so. Eddie?

940
01:24:38.172 --> 01:24:39.862
- I think we should go.

941
01:24:39.896 --> 01:24:41.172
- You just got here.

942
01:24:42.517 --> 01:24:44.758
- Drew's tired. It's
been a long day.

943
01:25:00.206 --> 01:25:01.379
- What am I missing?

944
01:25:01.413 --> 01:25:02.931
- I don't know.

945
01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:05.241
Everybody gets all fucking
weird about that necklace.

946
01:25:05.275 --> 01:25:06.724
Did you see his
face when he saw it?

947
01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:09.379
- Yeah. it was definitely
freaking me out.

948
01:25:09.413 --> 01:25:11.931
- I think my father's novel
has information about all

949
01:25:11.965 --> 01:25:13.862
of this. and it's
what drove him mad.

950
01:25:13.896 --> 01:25:15.758
And I think that's
why he killed himself.

951
01:25:17.275 --> 01:25:19.206
- I don't think you
should finish his book.

952
01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:20.724
- Why?

953
01:25:20.758 --> 01:25:22.689
- Because it's making you
mad. I'm worried about you.

954
01:25:24.827 --> 01:25:27.724
- I was having a drink
with Beatrice earlier.

955
01:25:27.758 --> 01:25:31.275
and she told me that
Lorena and Alia are dead.

956
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:33.379
And then five minutes
later. Eddie calls Lorena

957
01:25:33.413 --> 01:25:35.862
from the back and she's
standing right there.

958
01:25:35.896 --> 01:25:36.862
You saw her?

959
01:25:36.896 --> 01:25:39.413
- I did. but who's Beatrice?

960
01:25:39.448 --> 01:25:41.517
- Beatrice is Lorena's mother.

961
01:25:41.551 --> 01:25:43.793
I have a feeling she's
Alia's mother too.

962
01:25:45.793 --> 01:25:49.862
I don't know. I just. I
don't know anything anymore.

963
01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:51.827
- That doesn't make
any sense. Zora.

964
01:25:51.862 --> 01:25:53.275
None of it makes any sense.

965
01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:57.551
- Do you wanna
come home with me?

966
01:25:57.586 --> 01:25:59.551
Just forget all
this ever happened.

967
01:25:59.586 --> 01:26:02.586
forget this place and
just start all over.

968
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.758
- Yes. baby. of course.

969
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:06.517
- Good.

970
01:26:11.827 --> 01:26:13.517
Do you mind if I talk to Amadi?

971
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:15.517
- Yeah. sure.

972
01:26:21.793 --> 01:26:24.793
- Amadi. we're going home.

973
01:26:24.827 --> 01:26:26.620
and I just wanted
to say thank you.

974
01:26:29.034 --> 01:26:30.620
- Why's he wearing the necklace?

975
01:26:32.793 --> 01:26:35.482
- He's just quirky like
that. He found it on my desk.

976
01:26:37.551 --> 01:26:38.931
- You should give it
back to my mother.

977
01:26:39.793 --> 01:26:41.448
- How?

978
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.551
- Zora. do you have a minute?

979
01:26:47.586 --> 01:26:49.793
- Dr. Gooden. hi.

980
01:26:49.827 --> 01:26:52.482
Drew's here. I feel amazing.

981
01:26:52.517 --> 01:26:54.344
We're on our way back.

982
01:26:54.379 --> 01:26:56.758
- Thank God. You need
to get outta that house.

983
01:26:56.793 --> 01:26:58.517
It's not good for you.

984
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:01.413
- We are. What's going on?

985
01:27:01.448 --> 01:27:02.965
- I've been reading
over your father's files

986
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.758
and thinking about
what you told me.

987
01:27:04.793 --> 01:27:05.793
I'm gonna send you some photos.

988
01:27:05.827 --> 01:27:07.310
Let me know when you got 'em.

989
01:27:07.344 --> 01:27:08.620
- Okay.

990
01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.689
- Did you get the photos?

991
01:27:12.862 --> 01:27:14.241
- Let me put you on speaker.

992
01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:18.655
- Now that photo is
your father and his fiancee.

993
01:27:18.689 --> 01:27:20.413
- I know.

994
01:27:20.448 --> 01:27:21.344
- Is that
the woman that you've

995
01:27:21.379 --> 01:27:22.896
been seeing in your dreams?

996
01:27:22.931 --> 01:27:24.586
- Yes.

997
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.000
Yes. she's dead in my dreams.

998
01:27:28.724 --> 01:27:30.000
- Okay.

999
01:27:30.034 --> 01:27:32.448
Sending you another. Let
me know when you got it.

1000
01:27:35.862 --> 01:27:37.310
Did you get the photos?

1001
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:42.448
- Yeah.

1002
01:27:42.482 --> 01:27:45.000
- Now that is Alia.
Lorena and her husband. Eddie.

1003
01:27:45.034 --> 01:27:46.379
- I've met Lorena and Eddie.

1004
01:27:48.724 --> 01:27:50.896
- Zora. that's not possible.

1005
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:52.344
- I see them every day.

1006
01:27:54.034 --> 01:27:55.931
- And you are positive that
you've not read the file?

1007
01:27:59.379 --> 01:28:00.827
Zora. Zora. listen to me.

1008
01:28:02.655 --> 01:28:06.724
Many years ago. Alia was found
dead in your father's house.

1009
01:28:06.758 --> 01:28:07.931
And on that same day--

1010
01:28:22.655 --> 01:28:24.620
- This is
Zora. Leave a message.

1011
01:28:34.758 --> 01:28:35.931
- Drew. thank God.

1012
01:28:38.551 --> 01:28:39.379
What?

1013
01:28:41.655 --> 01:28:45.586
- Zora. You don't need to
remember that .

1014
01:28:47.586 --> 01:28:48.620
- No!

1015
01:28:52.413 --> 01:28:54.793
- Why did he have to come here?

1016
01:28:58.517 --> 01:28:58.965
- Amadi!

1017
01:29:05.896 --> 01:29:08.965
- What's happening with my baby?

1018
01:29:11.827 --> 01:29:15.034
- Amadi. Amadi. where
is Drew? Where'd he go?

1019
01:29:15.068 --> 01:29:16.620
- I told you not
to ask questions.

1020
01:29:18.827 --> 01:29:19.724
- I didn't know.

1021
01:29:21.068 --> 01:29:23.137
It wasn't his fault.
He couldn't have known.

1022
01:29:24.517 --> 01:29:26.448
- We coulda been
happy. all of us.

1023
01:29:27.724 --> 01:29:29.655
It didn't
have to change.

1024
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:32.103
- It was your father's fault.

1025
01:29:32.137 --> 01:29:35.931
- Then you made him
mad. He took my baby.

1026
01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:57.000
- The usual.

1027
01:29:57.034 --> 01:29:59.103
- Eddie. please.
you have to help me.

1028
01:29:59.137 --> 01:30:00.793
Have you seen Drew?

1029
01:30:00.827 --> 01:30:01.620
- Drew?

1030
01:30:01.655 --> 01:30:03.724
- My fiance. Drew.

1031
01:30:03.758 --> 01:30:06.137
- You want me to help you?

1032
01:30:06.172 --> 01:30:08.655
- Lorena and Alia are
trying to kill me.

1033
01:30:10.206 --> 01:30:11.620
Help me.

1034
01:30:12.827 --> 01:30:14.655
Help me please.

1035
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:16.068
- I really liked
your father. Zora.

1036
01:30:19.034 --> 01:30:22.793
Until
he betrayed me!

1037
01:30:53.724 --> 01:30:54.517
- Drew?

1038
01:30:56.586 --> 01:30:57.482
Drew?

1039
01:31:02.034 --> 01:31:02.862
Drew!

1040
01:31:03.896 --> 01:31:04.724
Drew!

1041
01:31:07.241 --> 01:31:08.068
Drew!

1042
01:31:10.206 --> 01:31:11.034
Drew?

1043
01:31:12.068 --> 01:31:13.689
- Your turn.

1044
01:31:19.931 --> 01:31:21.896
- Hello. Zora.

1045
01:31:21.931 --> 01:31:24.172
You know you've been
here before. don't you?

1046
01:31:27.206 --> 01:31:29.206
- I don't fucking care. Drew.

1047
01:31:29.241 --> 01:31:31.931
You're a lowdown. dirty.
sneaky piece of shit.

1048
01:31:31.965 --> 01:31:35.551
and I will never ever
ever forgive you.

1049
01:31:42.655 --> 01:31:45.793
- You know what your
father's book is about.

1050
01:31:45.827 --> 01:31:50.517
and you know why he
didn't finish it.

1051
01:31:50.551 --> 01:31:53.551
You knew Lorena and
Alia were my daughters

1052
01:31:53.586 --> 01:31:55.724
and they were both
in love with Eddie.

1053
01:32:00.241 --> 01:32:01.241
- But that all changed

1054
01:32:02.827 --> 01:32:05.241
when Thomas Morgan
Matthews showed up.

1055
01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:10.068
- I met your father.
when he arrived here too.

1056
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:13.310
- A visitor. he comes from
outta town and he meets

1057
01:32:13.344 --> 01:32:17.137
two sisters. and there's a
love triangle with another man.

1058
01:32:21.172 --> 01:32:23.758
- It was love at first sight.

1059
01:32:23.793 --> 01:32:27.620
- And everything was fine. until

1060
01:32:28.827 --> 01:32:30.620
Eddie became jealous.

1061
01:32:32.206 --> 01:32:35.793
And when he found out
that Alia was pregnant ...

1062
01:32:35.827 --> 01:32:37.137
- The husband becomes so enraged

1063
01:32:37.172 --> 01:32:39.241
that he kills the
younger sister.

1064
01:32:41.034 --> 01:32:44.586
- After Lorena found
out that Eddie killed Alia.

1065
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.000
she couldn't take the pain.

1066
01:32:47.275 --> 01:32:49.689
- Yes. yes. there
was a man on the path

1067
01:32:49.724 --> 01:32:51.620
and he was being attacked.
and I tried to save him.

1068
01:32:51.655 --> 01:32:55.241
and I turned him over
and it was my father

1069
01:32:55.275 --> 01:32:56.827
and it looked like he was dead.

1070
01:32:58.896 --> 01:33:01.655
- After
Eddie attacked your
father on the path.

1071
01:33:01.689 --> 01:33:04.689
he came back to the crime
scene to find that Lorena

1072
01:33:04.724 --> 01:33:08.310
had discovered what he had
done and took her own life.

1073
01:33:09.724 --> 01:33:12.275
That's when Eddie shot himself.

1074
01:33:16.241 --> 01:33:19.310
- I think my father's novel
has information about all

1075
01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.758
of this. and it's
what drove him mad.

1076
01:33:21.793 --> 01:33:23.655
And I think that's
why he killed himself.

1077
01:33:25.344 --> 01:33:28.275
- He caused my sorrow.

1078
01:33:30.068 --> 01:33:31.862
- It was your father's fault.

1079
01:33:33.068 --> 01:33:36.068
- Why did he have to come here?

1080
01:33:36.103 --> 01:33:39.103
- He blamed himself.
and that's why he ...

1081
01:33:39.137 --> 01:33:42.034
- Open your eyes. Zora.

1082
01:33:42.068 --> 01:33:43.862
- It didn't happen like that.

1083
01:33:43.896 --> 01:33:48.344
- When you went inside the
house. you already knew.

1084
01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:51.000
- No.

1085
01:33:51.034 --> 01:33:55.034
No. I met Amadi. and then
I met Eddie at his bar.

1086
01:33:55.068 --> 01:33:58.344
and I tried to save everyone.

1087
01:33:58.379 --> 01:34:03.034
- There is no Amadi.
There never was!

1088
01:34:03.068 --> 01:34:05.000
He was never born.

1089
01:34:05.034 --> 01:34:08.000
Eddie killed his
mother because she was

1090
01:34:08.034 --> 01:34:10.931
pregnant by your father.

1091
01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:12.724
- No.

1092
01:34:14.068 --> 01:34:15.000
- This

1093
01:34:16.137 --> 01:34:18.000
never happened. Zora.

1094
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:23.000
This right here.
isn't happening now.

1095
01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:25.655
You're dying. Zora.

1096
01:34:26.758 --> 01:34:28.000
- No.

1097
01:34:31.965 --> 01:34:33.379
- You're
dying right now.

1098
01:34:57.103 --> 01:34:59.379
- My dearest. sweet Zora.

1099
01:35:08.241 --> 01:35:10.448
God has gifted me
with but one child.

1100
01:35:12.034 --> 01:35:12.965
and that child is you.

1101
01:35:14.862 --> 01:35:17.448
Over the many years
that I have been running

1102
01:35:17.482 --> 01:35:21.310
from the demons. I have learned
one incontrovertible truth.

1103
01:35:22.862 --> 01:35:25.172
And that is to never
question the will of God.

1104
01:35:26.965 --> 01:35:29.965
but to wake up every morning
and give thanks. Zora.

1105
01:35:31.827 --> 01:35:33.448
I wish I had understood that.

1106
01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:43.344
I am so terribly sorry for the
pain that I have caused you.

1107
01:35:44.517 --> 01:35:46.448
But know that I have loved you

1108
01:35:46.482 --> 01:35:49.103
with every fiber of my being.

1109
01:35:57.172 --> 01:36:01.965
I want you to take
this cross. okay.

1110
01:36:03.103 --> 01:36:04.206
And I want you to wear it.

1111
01:36:06.965 --> 01:36:07.517
As a reminder

1112
01:36:09.103 --> 01:36:11.000
that you are not alone.

1113
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:18.551
That you're being protected
from the other side.

1114
01:36:22.586 --> 01:36:25.068
And don't follow in
my footsteps. baby.

1115
01:36:27.068 --> 01:36:28.413
Because you can do better.

1116
01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:31.172
Because you are better.

1117
01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:36.482
And just remember. the
demons are in your head.

1118
01:36:38.413 --> 01:36:40.551
but God lives in your heart.

1119
01:36:42.241 --> 01:36:44.206
So open your heart
and live. Zora.

1120
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:50.034
knowing that I will always
be here to protect you.

1121
01:36:51.448 --> 01:36:53.103
With eternal love. Daddy.

1122
01:36:58.275 --> 01:36:59.379
- Zora! Zora!

1123
01:37:01.965 --> 01:37:02.586
Zora!

1124
01:37:06.448 --> 01:37:09.965
Zora. baby. I'm right
here. I'm right here.

1125
01:37:18.137 --> 01:37:19.000
Hey. hey.

1126
01:37:23.655 --> 01:37:26.137
- It's okay.

1127
01:37:26.172 --> 01:37:28.310
Daddy told me it'll be okay.

1128
01:37:30.068 --> 01:37:34.620
- It's gonna be okay.
baby. I'm right here. okay?

1129
01:37:36.034 --> 01:37:37.034
I'm right here. I'm
not going anywhere.

1130
01:37:37.068 --> 01:37:38.379
