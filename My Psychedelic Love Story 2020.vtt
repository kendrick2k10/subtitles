3
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.254
The sound I'm going to play now

4
00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:50.258
is Timothy Leary's voice...

5
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.510
in 1974

6
00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:57.474
when he was incarcerated
at Vacaville Prison.

7
00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:01.728
He did a series of interviews

8
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.315
with one of the
psychologists at the prison.

9
00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.780
I'm just going
to play the very first words

10
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.616
he gave this psychologist.

11
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.474
Dr. Timothy Leary.

12
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:43.436
once a clinical psychologist
and Harvard professor.

13
00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.646
now. by his own description.

14
00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.397
a visionary prophet.

15
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.234
Others have called him
the man most responsible

16
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.903
for the North American crisis
over LSD.

17
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.239
We're teaching people
how to use their head.

18
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.491
The. uh. point is...

19
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.493
that in order to use your head.

20
00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.954
you have to go out of your mind.

21
00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.832
He... was

22
00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.875
put in prison

23
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.837
as an ideological trafficker

24
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.797
that had to be stopped.

25
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.966
After he escaped from prison

26
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.552
and spent three years in Europe.

27
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:20.223
we were both trapped
and captured in Afghanistan.

28
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.854
My biggest question:

29
00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.524
Was I being manipulated?

30
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.527
And if I was manipulated.

31
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.029
how far back did it go?

32
00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:43.163
Whatever forces

33
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.124
had been following Timothy

34
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.876
since way back.

35
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.880
All of the counterculture said

36
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:57.010
that I was
a CIA sex provocateur.

37
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:59.387
a Mata Hari.

38
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.806
that I had been sent

39
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.059
to lead Timothy to Afghanistan

40
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.896
and get him arrested.

41
00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.064
Twenty.

42
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.609
Is Joanna Harcourt-Smith.

43
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.112
his one contact/spokesagent.

44
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.906
a sex spy?

45
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:21.201
An agent provocateuse.

46
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:22.744
a double agent.

47
00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.871
a CIA hysteric.

48
00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.373
a jealous tigress. or what?

49
00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.292
All of the above.

50
00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.586
So you're a CIA plant?

51
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.088
I still wonder to this day.

52
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.887
It's in watching Wormwood...

53
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.265
where I said to myself.

54
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.393
"Maybe I was a CIA plant."

55
00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.605
And maybe I'd been manipulated

56
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.108
to... lead Timothy Leary

57
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.527
back into being captured.

58
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.617
Uh. this is
Joanna Harcourt.

59
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.619
First I'd like to show you
these two papers

60
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.871
that. uh.
Timothy Leary gave me

61
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.873
two minutes before
we got off the plane

62
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.875
in Los Angeles
yesterday evening.

63
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.798
I'll read them to you.

64
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.176
"January 18th. 1973.

65
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.678
To Joanna Harcourt-Smith.

66
00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.763
I lovingly give all the rights

67
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:27.600
to transmit the story
of our perfect love in Spain.

68
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.270
Switzerland. Austria. USA.

69
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:33.982
Lebanon. Afghanistan. Germany.
et cetera. Timothy Leary."

70
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.858
If you'd like to see them.

71
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.824
I loved him.

72
00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:46.286
I had known him for six weeks.

73
00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.621
We had traveled like

74
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.916
shooting stars across Europe.

75
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.210
taking acid every day...

76
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.507
plunging into the maddest.

77
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.885
romantic relationship
you could ever imagine.

78
00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.683
I knew nothing about him.

79
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.021
I had not read
any of his books.

80
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.359
I had heard
the Moody Blues song.

81
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.362
I remember exactly

82
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.864
where I heard that song.

83
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.491
Seven months pregnant

84
00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.536
in a bathtub
in Trenton. New Jersey.

85
00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:32.498
which for me was
like stranger than Peru.

86
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.251
with my tummy protruding
out of the water

87
00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.836
and hearing...

88
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.130
Timothy Leary's dead

89
00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.174
No. no. no. no

90
00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.968
He's outside. looking in

91
00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.517
Timothy Leary's dead

92
00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.689
And I got this
strange destiny feeling.

93
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.359
It's happened to me
many times in my life.

94
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.818
This is a turning point.

95
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.322
He'll fly his astral plane

96
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:08.242
Takes you trips
around the bay

97
00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.828
Timothy Leary

98
00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.415
Timothy Leary

99
00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.251
LSD was calling me.

100
00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.920
Definitely.

101
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.592
The Supreme Court
today overturned

102
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.594
the narcotics conviction
of Dr. Timothy Leary.

103
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.055
and in the process dealt
a crippling blow

104
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.973
to federal marijuana laws.

105
00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:33.226
I don't think
that I'm ever going to spend

106
00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:35.561
more than one day in jail--
that's my limit.

107
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.438
You see. it would be suicidal

108
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.482
for the United States
government to put me in jail.

109
00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:42.026
Every time they arrest me.
they bring more interest

110
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.153
and sympathy
for what we're doing.

111
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.490
'Cause we're not criminals.
we're not dope addicts.

112
00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.410
We're sincere people trying
to do our best for our society

113
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.911
and for our own souls.

114
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.838
I had a very painful childhood.

115
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.883
Much of it was about

116
00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.345
being Jews in Europe.

117
00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.475
My mother went through
two world wars.

118
00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:20.231
She went through
two world wars as a Jew.

119
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.944
She carried the trauma

120
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:28.656
of having escaped Poland.

121
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:34.120
She carried the trauma
of 77 of her relatives

122
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.455
being killed.

123
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:40.001
Except for sometimes
being funny...

124
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.713
my mother was...

125
00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:47.842
well.

126
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.928
she treated me like

127
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.555
she was Hitler

128
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.307
and I was the Jew.

129
00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:59.187
That didn't make
for a very happy childhood.

130
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:06.986
I think I was about 11 when
I found out we were Jewish.

131
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.822
And so. I immediately ran
to my mother

132
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.324
and I said to her.

133
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:13.618
"This is wonderful.
we're Jewish!

134
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.205
We're the most intelligent
people in the world!"

135
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.874
And she slapped me
across the face.

136
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.630
She said. "Never.
never. never say that."

137
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:29.550
Being a Catholic
was the salvation.

138
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.553
It would save her child.
her children.

139
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.139
and. uh. it would save her.

140
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.562
So back to LSD calling me.

141
00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.732
There was something
that could provoke

142
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.276
an enormous change in me.

143
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:52.114
And perhaps I could find out

144
00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:55.076
what it was to feel planted.

145
00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.830
Something is being born.

146
00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.583
and I wanted to be part of it.

147
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.045
For those of you who. uh.

148
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.047
missed the last
thrilling installment

149
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.882
in this Keystone Kops drama.

150
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.552
yesterday afternoon
Rosemary and I came here

151
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:16.097
to talk to the press
about. uh. our views

152
00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:18.266
and to. uh.
answer any questions.

153
00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:20.101
And. as you probably know. uh.

154
00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:21.602
I was arrested

155
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.105
and then immediately
released at the. um.

156
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:25.314
at the jail.

157
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.611
Dr. Timothy Leary.
the former Harvard instructor

158
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.947
who became an exponent of LSD.

159
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.491
has been convicted of illegally
transporting marijuana

160
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.744
and faces a possible
20-year prison sentence.

161
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.962
At that time.
this character I had been

162
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.590
lovers with...

163
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:53.175
when I was 18 years old...

164
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:57.138
a man called Michel Hauchard...

165
00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:01.142
came to visit me.

166
00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:03.436
He was an arms dealer...

167
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.523
a James Bond villain.

168
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:11.193
Timothy called him Goldfinger.

169
00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.488
Do you expect me
to talk?

170
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.993
No. Mr. Bond.
I expect you to die.

171
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.663
He was always trying
to get back with me.

172
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.498
He would say to me.
"I have a Rolls-Royce."

173
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.250
and I'd say. "I don't care."

174
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.085
He'd say. "I have a villa
in the south of France."

175
00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.462
I'd say. "I don't care."

176
00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.005
We had dinner.

177
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.007
and at dinner he said to me.

178
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.093
"I own Timothy Leary."

179
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.429
So I said.
"What is Timothy Leary?"

180
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.932
"It's this man who's
very famous in America.

181
00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:44.602
and he's escaped from prison."

182
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.688
That was so exciting for me!

183
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.358
I almost wanted to be
with an outlaw.

184
00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.860
Dr. Timothy Leary.
formerly of Harvard.

185
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.196
now known as the High Priest
of the drug cult.

186
00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.740
escaped during the night from
the California Men's Colony

187
00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.533
at San Luis Obispo.

188
00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:02.036
Dr. Leary was serving
a term of up to ten years

189
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.996
for possession of marijuana.

190
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.875
We want to tell the people
of the United States

191
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.336
the third world war has begun.

192
00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:12.588
Join us in the fight for freedom

193
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.674
because we are everywhere.

194
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.884
and we're happy
and we're free.

195
00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.053
And we want to make
the world free.

196
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.890
And how did he
come to "own" Timothy Leary?

197
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.433
Well. this is it.

198
00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.894
His friend recommended

199
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.979
that he be Timothy

200
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.940
and Rosemary's protector

201
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:32.942
in Switzerland.

202
00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:36.404
Michel gave them
a beautiful house...

203
00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:40.741
paid for a nice life.

204
00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.577
But after a short while he said.

205
00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:45.579
"If you write a book
about your escape.

206
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.665
I will sell it."

207
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.419
Michel said to Timothy.

208
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.920
"I would like you to

209
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.256
sign a contract where
you assign to me

210
00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:58.759
all your literary rights

211
00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.595
now and forever."

212
00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.389
Timothy had nothing to lose.

213
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.933
He was an outlaw on the run.

214
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.476
He signed it.

215
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.895
And so that's
what Michel meant

216
00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:11.480
when he sat next to me

217
00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:13.441
in that restaurant

218
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.609
in Marbella and said.

219
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:18.112
"I own Timothy Leary."

220
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.447
How rich is he?

221
00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.240
Who? Michel Hauchard?

222
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.616
Yes.

223
00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.076
How can I tell?

224
00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:28.122
You can never tell how rich.
rich people are.

225
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:31.292
Switzerland today
refused a United States request

226
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.837
for the extradition of
LSD advocate Timothy Leary.

227
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.215
Leary called it
a victory of love.

228
00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.592
Dr. Leary.

229
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:41.469
you are in exile
from your own country.

230
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.305
-You're a fugitive
from justice.
-Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:45.473
How do you feel about that.

232
00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:46.724
not being able to go home?

233
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.142
Well. it's ironic. um.

234
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.477
my joy today...

235
00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:51.270
comes because. uh.

236
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.314
I'm not going to go back
to the United States.

237
00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:55.566
I'm going to decline
the invitation of. uh.

238
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.402
Governor Reagan
and President Nixon to. uh.

239
00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.945
come back to their prison.

240
00:12:59.987 --> 00:13:04.658
I started thinking
about this Timothy Leary.

241
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.662
I just had this destiny thing.

242
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:17.171
I always feel when
there's going to be
a turn in my destiny.

243
00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:20.216
It's happened to me
again and again and again.

244
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:26.180
I was living in
the south of Spain

245
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.682
in this place called Marbella.

246
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.978
It was very groovy.

247
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:41.028
I took off with a man

248
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.280
in a VW bus.

249
00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:47.701
He spent a lot of time
with the Rolling Stones.

250
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.788
One of their songs is called

251
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.624
"Tommy the Tumbling Dice."

252
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.878
It's about my friend Tommy.

253
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.465
We went to see
Keith Richards

254
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.218
in Villars. in Switzerland.

255
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.348
Keith Richards had this lover.

256
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.976
Anita Pallenberg.

257
00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:15.896
who was quite a sizzling number.

258
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.357
I would say.

259
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.359
She almost singlehandedly

260
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:23.946
invented the Rolling Stones.

261
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:27.241
She said. "There's
this man. Timothy Leary.

262
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.077
and his wife is gone.

263
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.330
and you have to meet him."

264
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.627
At that time I was very busy.

265
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.005
What Tommy and I were doing is

266
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:45.843
we were trying
to convince Keith.

267
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.595
"Go to America

268
00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:50.514
and do a series

269
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.600
of concerts

270
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.853
to promote McGovern.

271
00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:00.441
We didn't want Nixon
to win the election.

272
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:03.235
And Keith said...

273
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.779
Sure.

274
00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:09.116
Tommy and I flew
to Washington. D.C.

275
00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:12.745
We went to the McGovern

276
00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.788
headquarters and we told them.

277
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.458
"Hey. the Rolling Stones
are willing to do

278
00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.961
three weeks or a month
of concerts for you."

279
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:26.008
And there was such
a sense of defeatism.

280
00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.261
They were so down.

281
00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.931
they felt so bad
that they couldn't accept.

282
00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:34.850
So.

283
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.937
next adventure?

284
00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.652
We went to New York.

285
00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:46.946
We were staying
with this friend of mine.

286
00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:49.156
Diane von Furstenberg.

287
00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:53.160
Those are the kind of people
I grew up with.

288
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.664
-The phone rang.

289
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:58.332
She handed me the phone.

290
00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.334
and I was just lying there

291
00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:02.002
on her mink blanket.

292
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.505
It was Michel.
Michel knew Diane.

293
00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:07.508
I made an appointment to go
and have drinks with him

294
00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:10.177
at the St. Regis.

295
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.013
He pulled out a check

296
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:16.308
for $250.000.

297
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.185
That's a lot of money.

298
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:21.689
He says. "That's what
Bantam Books gave me

299
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.110
for the manuscript
that Timothy has just written

300
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.861
about his escape

301
00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:31.198
and his life on the run."

302
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.827
the book that became
Confessions of a Hope Fiend.

303
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.498
He was emulating
Aleister Crowley.

304
00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.046
Well. I thought.
"Oh. my goodness.

305
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.424
this guy's
really interesting."

306
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.105
Tommy and I flew to Geneva.

307
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.566
went into Lausanne.

308
00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:50.110
-went up to Michel's house.

309
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:53.238
The Moroccan butler
opened the door.

310
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.994
We gave him a good English
hashish spliff.

311
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.163
I went into Michel's office

312
00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:04.374
and I opened his address book.

313
00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.794
and I found
about five phone numbers

314
00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.254
for Timothy.

315
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:13.258
Isn't Tommy jealous
of your interest in Leary?

316
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.095
Well. he thought
he'd be included.

317
00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:18.138
I mean. he didn't think that

318
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.476
Timothy and I were going
to be each other's destiny.

319
00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:26.730
Then I went to

320
00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.566
the Palace Hotel in Lausanne.

321
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:30.984
I didn't have any money.

322
00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:34.988
I never have any money.
but things happen.

323
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.574
And they knew me because
I learned to walk there.

324
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:40.702
We got this beautiful suite.

325
00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:42.913
I started calling Timothy.

326
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.083
Hello?

327
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.920
I told him I saw
Michel Hauchard in New York

328
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:53.132
and he has a big check of yours.

329
00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:56.844
He invited us to come to Lucerne

330
00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:58.303
and meet him.

331
00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:00.264
We got a bunch of balloons

332
00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.808
which we put in
the back of the car

333
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.185
and we drove to Lucerne.

334
00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.230
Multicolored balloons?

335
00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.524
Multicolored balloons.
of course.

336
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:16.864
I think I must have looked
at him from the feet to the top.

337
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.866
And I swear it looked like

338
00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:21.326
he was dancing.

339
00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:22.786
not walking.

340
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.331
I immediately thought.
"Oh. my goodness.

341
00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:29.209
this man is
incredibly attractive.

342
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:34.798
He invited us to go
to his chalet.

343
00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:39.386
He said.
"Will you come with me?"

344
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:43.682
He had this
canary yellow Porsche.

345
00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:47.936
I thought. "Well. this is
getting better and better.

346
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:50.314
This man is hip!"

347
00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:54.401
Maybe hip enough for me.

348
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.363
And we went to his chalet.

349
00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:01.366
And he had three
or four people there.

350
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.369
He said.

351
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.039
"Does anybody want to take LSD?"

352
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:14.463
I had two Clear Light acid...

353
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.299
and I said. "Well. yes.

354
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.093
but I just have enough
for you and me."

355
00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.429
He said to me.

356
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.640
"You've come to free me."

357
00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.771
I thought.

358
00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:33.440
"Okay."

359
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:36.443
I was a little intimidated.
but not too much.

360
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.862
And we went to this restaurant.

361
00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.949
I was still tripping.

362
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.118
Everything was
going whoosh. whoosh.

363
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.287
For the people who know. uh.

364
00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:50.791
there can be great liquidity

365
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:52.626
when you've taken acid.

366
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.962
He ordered eggs and bacon.

367
00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:58.131
To me. the eggs were like eyes.

368
00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.926
but he was very comfortable

369
00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:02.678
with having a good breakfast.

370
00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:06.431
He brought his
tarot cards with him.

371
00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:08.976
He explained to me that he was

372
00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:11.478
a reincarnation

373
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.188
of Aleister Crowley...

374
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.609
and that this was
Crowley's deck.

375
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:24.157
And the first card was
the Wheel of Fortune.

376
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:27.995
and he said to me.
"That's what you are to me.

377
00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:29.830
Watch the wheel turn

378
00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.874
and destiny turn.

379
00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:37.004
It's going to have an enormous
influence on my life."

380
00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:40.340
And then he pulled
the second card

381
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.050
and it was Prudence.

382
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.512
And I thought.

383
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:48.015
"No. no.
I'll pass on that."

384
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.683
And then.

385
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.644
he pulled out...

386
00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.188
the Tower.

387
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.525
which is an absolute explosion.

388
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.362
It is a card designed

389
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.531
to tell you

390
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:07.743
that many times in life

391
00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:10.162
when something major passes.

392
00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:13.999
it feels like
everything you knew

393
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.667
is being destroyed

394
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.919
to be renewed.

395
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:22.549
That's what
the Tower represents.

396
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:25.844
Absolute chaos...

397
00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:29.264
and transformation.

398
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:36.646
And at that moment
he said to me.

399
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:39.399
"You've come to free me.

400
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:42.527
and I'm returning to America."

401
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:45.947
I didn't really understand
what he meant...

402
00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:50.660
but I knew we were bonded.

403
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.289
Truly bonded.

404
00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:02.005
Is there where
Dennis Martino enters?

405
00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:06.093
Dennis Martino
was at the chalet.

406
00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:10.263
The sorcerer's apprentice.

407
00:23:11.973 --> 00:23:15.769
A dope dealer with
the Brotherhood of Eternal Love.

408
00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.979
A group of

409
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:21.733
Laguna Beach surfers...

410
00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:26.071
who dealt hashish

411
00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:28.073
between Afghanistan

412
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:30.784
and the United States.

413
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:32.744
Dennis knew Timothy

414
00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:35.330
because Dennis's twin brother

415
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:37.165
made a baby

416
00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.626
with Timothy's daughter.

417
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:43.463
Is there any suggestion--

418
00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.298
I know that this became
an issue later--

419
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.716
maybe I'm jumping ahead--

420
00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:49.719
that Dennis might be
working against Timothy?

421
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.096
If you want. Errol.

422
00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:54.099
we can. uh.
at some point get into

423
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.101
"strange stuff."

424
00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:58.645
One of the reasons I...

425
00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.981
came to get you

426
00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:04.651
was because of
these strangenesses.

427
00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:07.070
People are here.
then they show up here.

428
00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:12.492
You asked earlier.
Why would you be manipulated?

429
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:16.872
Well. because I
think this is a huge part

430
00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:19.332
of the manipulation

431
00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:22.043
by government that has led us

432
00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:24.254
to where we are today...

433
00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:28.884
the Timothy Leary story.

434
00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:31.344
President Nixon
asked Congress today

435
00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:34.347
for new laws to deal
with drugs and narcotics.

436
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:36.141
The new laws
the President wants

437
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:38.143
would replace parts of
the Marijuana Act

438
00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:40.854
struck down by
the Supreme Court last year.

439
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.273
Other legislation
would give a task force

440
00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.984
of federal agents
broad new powers to break in

441
00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:48.528
and make arrests
without warning.

442
00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:27.526
After breakfast.

443
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:29.903
we go back to his house.

444
00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:33.406
Tommy explains to him

445
00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:38.286
that the way we're going
to get him out of Switzerland.

446
00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.997
we're going to buy a sailboat

447
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.667
in Amsterdam.

448
00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.836
We're going to make
that sailboat

449
00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:49.214
a radio station.

450
00:25:51.424 --> 00:25:53.426
We're going to
start broadcasting

451
00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:56.930
revolutionary messages.

452
00:25:56.972 --> 00:26:00.225
peace and love messages.

453
00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:03.395
We're going to sail
over to Jamaica

454
00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:08.108
where the Rolling Stones are
recording their latest album.

455
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:11.945
We left Timothy and went
back to the Palace Hotel.

456
00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:13.780
They said that
if I didn't pay the bill.

457
00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:16.199
I was going to be arrested
in the morning.

458
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:19.786
I thought.
"That's amazing!

459
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:23.623
I'm going to experience
what Timothy experienced."

460
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:29.004
The Swiss prisons
were very civilized.

461
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:33.258
I asked them to bring me
some magazines.

462
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.678
I asked them to bring me
some café au lait.

463
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.597
They were very obliging.

464
00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:41.099
It was sort of easy
for me to say.

465
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:45.186
"Come on. release me.
somebody's going
to pay this bill.

466
00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:47.272
Goldfinger paid the bill.

467
00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:49.983
In gold bullion.

468
00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:53.320
Went back
to where Timothy lived...

469
00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:57.365
ran into his arms saying.

470
00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:59.576
"I just went to prison!"

471
00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:04.497
I was so naive.
it was incredible.

472
00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:07.751
We decided that we would give

473
00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:09.919
Tommy a thousand dollars

474
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.838
to go look for a boat.

475
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.090
A thousand dollars
to get rid of him?

476
00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:16.009
Yeah. right.

477
00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.764
When did you first realize

478
00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.016
that you could control men?

479
00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.686
Oof.

480
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.189
The first time a man

481
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.859
kissed my neck
when I was maybe...

482
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:35.278
eleven. 12 years old.

483
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.907
I had this surge of power.

484
00:27:38.948 --> 00:27:41.660
There's definitely something

485
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:44.496
I can control in this life.

486
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.960
Leary was emanating.

487
00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:53.713
Sexy. Power. Charm.

488
00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:58.843
We went off on the road
in the yellow Porsche.

489
00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:00.929
in the sparkling night

490
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.516
with beautiful
Swiss snow falling

491
00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:06.309
and LSD.

492
00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:09.145
I was with him
in this bubble.

493
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:12.732
in this amazing
yellow spaceship.

494
00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:16.861
I was beginning to feel

495
00:28:16.903 --> 00:28:19.906
some sense that I had arrived.

496
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:26.079
I was a bit surprised because
we'd been together for a week...

497
00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.748
and we didn't have sex.

498
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.667
In those days. I felt that

499
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:34.337
if I was with a man
and I didn't have sex with him

500
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.423
pretty quickly.

501
00:28:36.464 --> 00:28:38.425
we weren't really bonded.

502
00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:42.095
But we got to
the Palace Hotel...

503
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:47.559
and we went to our room.

504
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.602
and then he said to me.

505
00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:51.855
"Sit on the bed."

506
00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:55.275
He had... necklaces

507
00:28:55.316 --> 00:28:58.611
and bracelets

508
00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:01.698
and sort of Indian jewelry.

509
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.950
I instinctively got naked.

510
00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:06.786
He started putting the jewelry

511
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:08.246
all over me.

512
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:11.624
He told me that I was
the Goddess Lakshmi.

513
00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:18.298
Then he took out
a Life magazine.

514
00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:21.134
In that issue
of Life magazine

515
00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:24.387
were the first images

516
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.639
of inside the brain.

517
00:29:29.976 --> 00:29:31.311
And he said to me.

518
00:29:31.352 --> 00:29:34.939
"That's where I'm going to be

519
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:37.275
making love to you."

520
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.362
And indeed.

521
00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:43.490
it was quite a loving...

522
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:46.409
session.

523
00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:36.835
So. anyway.

524
00:30:36.876 --> 00:30:39.879
we left Gstaad.
and we were going to go to

525
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.383
St. Moritz where I was born.

526
00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:45.218
My mother was there

527
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.054
in January 1946.

528
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:51.558
mainly to play bridge.

529
00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:54.519
Suddenly she started
having pains.

530
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:56.896
Apparently
the village doctor told her

531
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:58.857
she had appendicitis

532
00:30:58.898 --> 00:31:02.402
and gave her
lots of painkillers

533
00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:03.903
and. as she said.

534
00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:08.074
"After about 40 hours
of bothering me.

535
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:09.951
you came out."

536
00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:12.370
And I weighed a kilo 50.

537
00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:15.790
Not much bigger
than a Nathan's hotdog.

538
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:20.003
So he took me
to the very beginning.

539
00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:24.549
During all this time.

540
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.092
Timothy--

541
00:31:26.134 --> 00:31:29.429
you have to remember
he's a psychologist.

542
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.891
He made me tell
my whole story.

543
00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:37.270
I don't have much of a memory

544
00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:39.272
till I'm about

545
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:42.191
four years old.

546
00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:46.613
We lived in the most
beautiful part of Paris

547
00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:48.615
called the Avenue Foch.

548
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:52.285
Apparently I lied all the time.

549
00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:56.581
My nanny was very Catholic.

550
00:31:56.623 --> 00:31:58.708
Nanny decided with Mommy that

551
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.960
I should swear
before the Cross

552
00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:03.129
that I was never going
to lie again.

553
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:05.423
Well. wow!

554
00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:07.926
I was wrong.

555
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:09.844
I betrayed Jesus.

556
00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:16.184
Every summer.

557
00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:18.478
I would be taken to stay

558
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.813
at this villa

559
00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:23.024
in the south of France.

560
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:25.610
the Villa Leonina.

561
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:27.487
My step-grandfather.

562
00:32:27.528 --> 00:32:30.365
Arpád Plesch.

563
00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:34.535
was what they called
an international financier.

564
00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:37.413
He had this huge.

565
00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:39.457
white villa

566
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:41.918
overlooking the Mediterranean.

567
00:32:44.712 --> 00:32:48.925
He had 70 servants.

568
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.344
twelve of which were gardeners.

569
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:54.639
He had a head gardener.

570
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:58.685
And it was a garden with plants
from all over the world.

571
00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:00.770
And my grandfather flew in

572
00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.690
the most extraordinary birds.

573
00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:06.359
It was called the Exotic Garden.

574
00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:11.698
I used to take
my little friend. Rhoda.

575
00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:15.201
to go and play
with the head gardener.

576
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:17.245
One day my grandfather

577
00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:20.707
took me aside and he said.

578
00:33:20.748 --> 00:33:23.543
"Rhoda told her nanny

579
00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:25.712
that the head gardener
touched her."

580
00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:27.547
He said to me.

581
00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:31.259
"But all little girls
are Messalinas.

582
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.428
and they try to seduce."

583
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.888
That afternoon.

584
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.474
I was taken to the gendarmes.

585
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:40.685
Two gendarmes there

586
00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:42.562
kept asking me

587
00:33:42.603 --> 00:33:45.690
if the head gardener
had touched my pee-pee.

588
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:50.570
I said. "No. No."

589
00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:52.655
It lasted for what was

590
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.907
a very long time for me.

591
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.245
In the end.

592
00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:03.249
I told them that he did.

593
00:34:05.084 --> 00:34:07.670
But I know that I didn't know.

594
00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.756
I just wanted to please them.

595
00:34:09.797 --> 00:34:13.092
So they brought him in.
in handcuffs.

596
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:16.929
for what the French call
"The Confrontation."

597
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:19.766
They said repeat that
in front of him.

598
00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:22.143
I said. "He touched me."

599
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.230
And they took him to prison.

600
00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:32.111
My mother had

601
00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:34.405
this very handsome chauffeur.

602
00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:36.491
I don't think the chauffeur

603
00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:38.951
was automatically the lover.

604
00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:41.037
I think my mother preferred

605
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.623
ambassadors and commodores

606
00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:45.708
and commanders.

607
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.631
She bragged she made
love with Mussolini.

608
00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.800
She had hired
this Spanish chauffeur.

609
00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:56.135
His name was Jesus.

610
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.137
She would have none of that.

611
00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.723
She named him Ivan.

612
00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:03.810
She wasn't going
to go around calling Jesus.

613
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.107
In those days. in Paris.

614
00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:12.401
it was very fashionable
to have cocktail parties.

615
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:15.613
Six o'clock.
my mother was gone.

616
00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:20.827
She had decorated my bedroom
like it was a farm.

617
00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:23.579
My bed was a wheelbarrow.

618
00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:27.458
My cupboard was a barn.

619
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.544
One night.

620
00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:32.839
when Mummy had gone
out to a cocktail party.

621
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.299
the servants were up
in their rooms.

622
00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:37.385
Ivan came to my room.

623
00:35:37.426 --> 00:35:40.596
He started putting his hands

624
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.557
under my pajama.

625
00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:44.976
under the top.

626
00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:46.602
under the bottom.

627
00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:50.189
I tried to concentrate
on the pigeons...

628
00:35:51.774 --> 00:35:53.693
on the window.

629
00:35:53.734 --> 00:35:57.780
They were a lot of pigeons
that would come

630
00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.657
to the window.

631
00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:01.617
I had the feeling

632
00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.286
there was something that was...

633
00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.789
extremely.

634
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.041
extremely wrong.

635
00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:17.800
And at the same time.

636
00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:25.224
I-I felt a sensation

637
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:31.981
that was not altogether...

638
00:36:36.777 --> 00:36:38.738
disagreeable.

639
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.494
And I want to say this.

640
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:49.957
The fact that there was
a slight sensation of...

641
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.131
of being seen.

642
00:36:57.173 --> 00:36:59.050
of being wanted...

643
00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.595
um...

644
00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:06.390
it created

645
00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:11.771
enormous confusion... for me.

646
00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:13.272
The guilt.

647
00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:16.275
Did you tell your mother?

648
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:18.444
Oh. yeah.

649
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:20.780
She said. um...

650
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.951
"Good chauffeurs
are hard to find."

651
00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.873
Well. first she said
I was lying.

652
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.335
And then she said...

653
00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:38.881
"Good chauffeurs
are hard to find."

654
00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:43.636
You have to know something
because we're talking about

655
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:48.683
what motivated me
to look for Timothy Leary.

656
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:51.602
I feel all of this
is part of it.

657
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:55.439
He was one of
the foremost psychologists

658
00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:56.983
of our time.

659
00:37:58.401 --> 00:38:00.403
He sensed that

660
00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:03.322
psychedelics
could be medicines...

661
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:08.286
that they could cure trauma

662
00:38:08.327 --> 00:38:10.329
and PTSD.

663
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:12.623
This trajectory
of my childhood.

664
00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:16.168
it led me to find him.

665
00:38:42.903 --> 00:38:46.282
So then we went off
to visit a friend of mine

666
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.659
who had a beautiful chalet.

667
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:51.537
You know the Opel cars?

668
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:56.000
She was the von Opel heir.

669
00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:57.710
She gave a party.

670
00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:02.214
Andy Warhol and his
whole crew showed up.

671
00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:06.969
And Timothy said.

672
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:11.390
"You and I are
the two most intelligent
men in America."

673
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.017
He turned to me and he said.

674
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:15.227
"And she is the most intelligent

675
00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:17.605
woman in the world."

676
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:22.234
Andy brought with him
a whole pile

677
00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:25.738
of 45 rpm records

678
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.365
from the '50s.

679
00:39:28.741 --> 00:39:30.910
And he insisted
that we dance.

680
00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:34.246
I love you.
I love you. I love you

681
00:39:34.288 --> 00:39:36.916
And where you go
I'll follow. I'll follow.
I'll follow

682
00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:41.420
You'll always be
my true love. my true love.
my true love

683
00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:46.258
From now until forever.
forever. forever

684
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.718
I will follow you

685
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.428
The next day he told me.

686
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.807
"We're going
to drive off to Vienna.

687
00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:55.643
and I'm going to do a film

688
00:39:55.684 --> 00:40:02.191
that will say that
I'm completely against drugs."

689
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:05.986
He felt that the man
who was the prime minister

690
00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:09.448
of Austria was going
to give him asylum.

691
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:15.788
His asylum in Switzerland
was not safe anymore.

692
00:40:18.332 --> 00:40:20.584
At what point did he become

693
00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:23.587
the most dangerous man
in America?

694
00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:26.799
I think that was
one of Nixon's slogans.

695
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:32.638
America's public enemy
number one in the United States

696
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.808
is drug abuse.

697
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.977
In order to fight
and defeat this enemy.

698
00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:41.063
it is necessary to wage a new.

699
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:43.732
all-out offensive.

700
00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.861
It gets tense
when you're a major outlaw.

701
00:40:49.029 --> 00:40:51.490
We got to Vienna.
and what they wanted was

702
00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:55.661
for him to say
that drugs were great.

703
00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:59.206
He wasn't very pleased
to be doing that.

704
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:06.213
Also. I have to tell you.

705
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:08.841
that at that time

706
00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:12.470
I became completely orange.

707
00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:14.847
like a sunflower.

708
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:20.019
He suggested we go
to the university hospital.

709
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.521
and there were
maybe 200 students there.

710
00:41:22.563 --> 00:41:26.317
I threw off my coat and I
lifted my sleeves and I said.

711
00:41:26.358 --> 00:41:29.820
"Doctor. you have something
more important to do.

712
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:34.700
You have a patient here
who has a terrible illness."

713
00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:37.786
In the book.
you said you were naked!

714
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.831
Well... maybe I was.

715
00:41:44.084 --> 00:41:46.545
And how did
the students react?

716
00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:50.174
Oh. there was a roar.
Everybody adored it.

717
00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:53.886
I don't know.
if Timothy wasn't in love
with me until that moment.

718
00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:57.389
it totally busted
his heart open.

719
00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:03.896
Timothy's daughter

720
00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:06.732
had come back from India.

721
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:10.402
She had brought water
from the Ganges.

722
00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:13.739
I thought it would be
very gracious on my part

723
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.741
to drink that bottle of water.

724
00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:19.370
"This is going to be
your stepdaughter.

725
00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:22.248
and she's the same age you are.

726
00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:26.001
and she hands you a bottle
of water from the Ganges.

727
00:42:27.127 --> 00:42:28.796
So I drank it up.

728
00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:31.257
I always thought that
it was probably that water

729
00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:34.260
that gave me the...

730
00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:37.304
hepatitis.

731
00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:41.183
In the middle of all that.
Dennis showed up

732
00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:43.102
and started saying...

733
00:42:44.478 --> 00:42:47.147
that we should go
to Afghanistan.

734
00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:51.277
Timothy started explaining.

735
00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:53.946
"I know some people there

736
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:56.448
who would give us
a lot of money.

737
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.035
and then you and I
will go on to Ceylon.

738
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:03.872
and we'll be poets on the beach

739
00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:06.709
and have babies."

740
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:11.880
I thought that was the most
marvelous. magical plan

741
00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.507
you could imagine.

742
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:15.134
Then we found out that Dennis

743
00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:16.969
had driven the Porsche

744
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:18.721
and totaled it.

745
00:43:22.182 --> 00:43:24.351
There was no way out

746
00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:27.563
but forward and up and in.

747
00:43:31.358 --> 00:43:33.360
We've left Vienna.

748
00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:37.156
We've left what I know.

749
00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:40.451
But we're going
to make a stopover

750
00:43:40.492 --> 00:43:42.661
in Beirut.

751
00:43:46.874 --> 00:43:49.126
I'm really glad
we're going to Beirut

752
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:51.503
because I know the president

753
00:43:51.545 --> 00:43:54.840
'cause the president
was in love with my mother.

754
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:57.676
I knew we would be
received very well.

755
00:43:57.718 --> 00:44:00.471
Also. I was a star

756
00:44:00.512 --> 00:44:03.682
on Lebanese TV

757
00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:08.062
when I was between
the age of 14 and 15.

758
00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.858
I was watching
television in Beirut.

759
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.361
and I saw
they had a quiz show.

760
00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:18.864
I applied for the quiz show
and I was taken.

761
00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:21.533
- To be a contestant.
-To be a contestant.

762
00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:22.993
And I loved it.

763
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:29.375
You had to figure out
who was lying.

764
00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:31.919
The man who was
in charge of programs

765
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.379
came up to me and he said.

766
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.422
"You're really good
on television."

767
00:44:35.464 --> 00:44:37.216
Then I said to him.

768
00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:39.677
"Okay. well. why don't
you produce a show with me?

769
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:44.682
Let's have a show called
Teenagers Club."

770
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:47.017
From the book.
you tell a story

771
00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:50.270
that almost all of
the producers were
in love with you.

772
00:44:50.312 --> 00:44:52.147
Well. they were.

773
00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:54.024
When I was 15.

774
00:44:54.066 --> 00:44:57.736
that's when I started
having a lot of sex.

775
00:44:57.778 --> 00:44:59.405
Can't say I regret it.

776
00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:07.830
We stopped in Beirut.

777
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:11.792
Something very extraordinary
happened there.

778
00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:14.420
You have to remember.

779
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:16.588
I didn't know Timothy
for a long time.

780
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.882
And I really didn't understand

781
00:45:18.924 --> 00:45:23.595
the significance of
his life work until then.

782
00:45:23.637 --> 00:45:28.392
And we're at the son
of the president's house.

783
00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:30.936
He saw all these books
by Jung.

784
00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:34.148
and he turned to me
and he said.

785
00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:36.650
"They're not going
to understand my work

786
00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:39.945
until after I'm dead."

787
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.420
He was telling me
he was a fugitive.
so I said to him.

788
00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:40.339
"Well. I have
a really good idea.

789
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.174
I think you should dye
your hair."

790
00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:49.348
I mean. I didn't know
I was up against the whole
United States government.

791
00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:54.144
I chose a rock 'n' roll look.

792
00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:58.023
purple trousers
and a silver shirt.

793
00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:00.108
I got some black dye.

794
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.445
So I started putting
the black dye on his hair.

795
00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:07.157
but then we made love

796
00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:09.785
and we forgot about
the black dye.

797
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:13.372
And his hair turned out to be

798
00:47:13.413 --> 00:47:15.874
absolute purple.

799
00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:19.378
Here was my rock 'n' roll
star professor.

800
00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:22.339
Here's a question:

801
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:26.343
why does he have to travel
in some kind of disguise?

802
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:29.221
He knows that

803
00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:31.223
any place he stops.

804
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:34.393
he might be arrested.

805
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.064
The indictment

806
00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.400
had just come out.

807
00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:46.113
They charged him with everything

808
00:47:46.154 --> 00:47:48.615
that the Brotherhood
of Eternal Love did.

809
00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:56.248
I am glad
that in this administration

810
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:59.042
we have increased
the amount of money

811
00:47:59.084 --> 00:48:02.754
for handling the problem
of dangerous drugs sevenfold.

812
00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:05.173
It will be $600 million
this year.

813
00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:09.511
This is one area where
we cannot have budget cuts.

814
00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.972
We must wage
what I have called total war

815
00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:15.684
against public enemy number one
in the United States.

816
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.603
the problem of dangerous drugs.

817
00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:25.277
Here we are.

818
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:27.613
Timothy. Dennis and me.

819
00:48:27.654 --> 00:48:31.450
finally on the plane from Beirut

820
00:48:31.491 --> 00:48:33.118
to Kabul.

821
00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:37.414
We walk into the terminal.

822
00:48:37.456 --> 00:48:42.419
This man snaps both passports

823
00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:44.463
out of Timothy's hands.

824
00:48:44.504 --> 00:48:47.799
He throws a card at us.

825
00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:51.345
and he starts
running out of the airport.

826
00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:53.263
"James Senner.

827
00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:58.101
second attaché at the Embassy
of the United States."

828
00:49:01.563 --> 00:49:04.983
It was utter shock.

829
00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:12.491
We go up to
the immigration people--

830
00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:16.995
"You can't come into
this country because you
don't have any passports."

831
00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:20.415
I'm having a fear

832
00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:23.168
like I've never had before.

833
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.212
Never had after.

834
00:49:27.547 --> 00:49:29.675
I put on the persona

835
00:49:29.716 --> 00:49:33.095
who threw her coat off

836
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:36.014
in front of
the professor in Vienna--

837
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:43.063
"If you separate me
from Timothy Leary. I will die."

838
00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:45.190
I fainted on the floor

839
00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:48.443
to show him
that I meant business.

840
00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:51.446
He said. "We're not going
to separate you."

841
00:49:53.365 --> 00:49:57.119
Then we were taken
to the Plaza Hotel...

842
00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:00.706
where they put foreigners

843
00:50:00.747 --> 00:50:03.041
in the rooms

844
00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:05.502
as prisoners.

845
00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:08.880
First time I asked
to go to the toilet.

846
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:12.217
they let Timothy come
to the toilet with me.

847
00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.052
He got down on his knees.

848
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:17.097
I don't know why it still
just makes me cry today.

849
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:20.767
It was such an act of
tenderness in that moment

850
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:25.272
that was
frenetically terrifying.

851
00:50:25.313 --> 00:50:29.359
with Timothy getting
down on his knees.

852
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:31.486
carefully. minutiously

853
00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.155
cleaning the toilet.

854
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:35.490
I felt protected

855
00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.951
in this moment of horror.

856
00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:43.081
These two Afghani
secret service

857
00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:44.541
came into the room

858
00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:48.086
and they started
interrogating Timothy.

859
00:50:48.128 --> 00:50:51.548
asking him who he was.

860
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.717
Timothy said.

861
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:57.929
"I am not going back to the
United States without Joanna."

862
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:02.267
And after about four days.

863
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:05.854
they told us that we were
being taken to the airport.

864
00:51:11.651 --> 00:51:13.445
We got into this Jeep

865
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:16.948
with the soldiers all around
with their machine guns.

866
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.326
and we got to the airport.

867
00:51:20.368 --> 00:51:22.954
An Indian doctor came up to me.

868
00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:26.792
presented me
with a paper that said.

869
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:28.627
"If something happens to you.

870
00:51:28.668 --> 00:51:33.507
you will not hold the
Afghani government responsible."

871
00:51:33.548 --> 00:51:35.884
I signed that paper. yeah.

872
00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:45.310
There was a plane
of Ariana Airlines.

873
00:51:45.352 --> 00:51:47.312
We started going up the steps.

874
00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:50.774
And this man with a beard said.

875
00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:54.152
"Agent Terrence Burke.

876
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:56.113
dope's the game.

877
00:51:56.154 --> 00:52:00.784
I've come to bring you
back to the United States."

878
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:04.913
And he handed Timothy
an ID card.

879
00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:08.041
Profession: Philosopher.

880
00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:12.420
They put us in first class.

881
00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:16.466
Two agents in
the seats behind us.

882
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:19.344
two agents in
the seat opposite us.

883
00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:22.514
I was so scared.

884
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:24.015
The plane was going
to do two stops--

885
00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:25.350
Tehran. Paris.

886
00:52:25.392 --> 00:52:28.395
I obviously had
paper to write with

887
00:52:28.436 --> 00:52:29.813
and I had a pen.

888
00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:32.858
And I wrote.
"This is Dr. Timothy Leary.

889
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:35.152
We are being kidnapped.

890
00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:37.863
Please give this
to the first authority

891
00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:40.949
that you see in
the airport in Paris."

892
00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:46.037
And I start dropping these
little papers on people's laps.

893
00:52:47.747 --> 00:52:50.333
About 15 minutes later.

894
00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:52.043
a voice came on and they said.

895
00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:56.047
"This plane is no longer
going to Paris.

896
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:59.467
It's been diverted
to Germany."

897
00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:04.890
I'm in the hands of people
who can just deviate a plane.

898
00:53:06.558 --> 00:53:10.395
They took us
into an empty waiting room.

899
00:53:11.396 --> 00:53:13.231
And the next day.

900
00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:17.110
they pushed us
onto a plane to L.A.

901
00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:19.237
In first class.

902
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:22.908
Well. on that flight to L.A.

903
00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:25.577
was this friend of my family.

904
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:27.787
friend of my sister.

905
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:31.374
this fabulous playboy
who had actually been married

906
00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:33.752
to Brigitte Bardot.

907
00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:38.089
And we drank champagne.

908
00:53:41.426 --> 00:53:44.054
And we talked. And we played.

909
00:53:47.807 --> 00:53:49.935
Timothy made a pact with them.

910
00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:51.895
that they would take care of me.

911
00:53:51.937 --> 00:53:55.190
I didn't really know
what was going to happen.

912
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:57.067
And shortly before we landed.

913
00:53:57.108 --> 00:54:00.528
he handed me his address book.

914
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.280
He wrote a paper saying:

915
00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:03.907
"The right to speak for me

916
00:54:03.949 --> 00:54:06.910
I hereby lovingly give
to Joanna Harcourt-Smith.

917
00:54:06.952 --> 00:54:08.954
who is my love. my voice.

918
00:54:08.995 --> 00:54:10.956
my wisdom. my words.

919
00:54:10.997 --> 00:54:12.415
my output to the world

920
00:54:12.457 --> 00:54:14.751
for our love.
et cetera. et cetera.

921
00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:18.463
Timothy Leary.
over Montana. USA.

922
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:21.216
January 18th. 1973."

923
00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:30.183
The day
we were brought back was

924
00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:32.602
the week the Plumbers

925
00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:34.604
got sentenced.

926
00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:38.483
It was the week of Nixon's
second inauguration.

927
00:54:40.402 --> 00:54:42.988
That was absolutely...

928
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:46.491
calculated.

929
00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:48.868
The law and order President.

930
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.870
They had been
tracking us all along.

931
00:54:50.912 --> 00:54:54.165
I mean. there's absolutely
no doubt about it.

932
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:58.003
You see. this is why I think

933
00:54:58.044 --> 00:55:01.339
the CIA had a lot
to do with this story.

934
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:04.801
I saw the order

935
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:07.345
from Ehrlichman that said.

936
00:55:07.387 --> 00:55:09.681
"Capture Dr. Timothy Leary

937
00:55:09.723 --> 00:55:13.643
and return him by any means."

938
00:55:13.685 --> 00:55:15.186
He's the best man
in the world.

939
00:55:15.228 --> 00:55:17.147
He's beautiful.
He's a philosopher.

940
00:55:17.188 --> 00:55:19.024
He's got all the answers.
He's happy.

941
00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:21.318
He's happy. you understand?
He's come back--

942
00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:23.987
He's come back because
he has got things to say

943
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:26.197
because he's a beautiful man

944
00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:28.116
and because he's going
to save the world

945
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.869
and because he's full of love.
and our love is perfect.

946
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.663
Our love is
the most beautiful love
that's ever existed.

947
00:55:33.705 --> 00:55:35.540
I met him two months ago
in Switzerland.

948
00:55:35.582 --> 00:55:38.084
and I haven't left him
a second ever since.

949
00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:40.337
And I know nothing of his past--

950
00:55:40.378 --> 00:55:43.673
I only know that I've lived
with him day and night.

951
00:55:43.715 --> 00:55:45.508
and that he's a perfect man.

952
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.635
Were you with him
when he was arrested?

953
00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.846
-A perfect love.
- Were you
with him when he was arrested?

954
00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:51.890
Yes. sir. I was with him.

955
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:54.142
It was totally illegal.

956
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:57.979
One of the reasons
I contacted you

957
00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:00.690
is I think there's
still a mystery here.

958
00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:07.572
Same as in Wormwood.

959
00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:09.824
How we were manipulated.

960
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.203
How I was used

961
00:56:13.244 --> 00:56:15.872
to lead Timothy Leary

962
00:56:15.914 --> 00:56:18.291
back into custody.

963
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.337
And the fact that

964
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:25.173
I don't know these things.

965
00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:28.760
I was told by Dennis
that Timothy met

966
00:56:28.802 --> 00:56:31.429
with this particular CIA agent

967
00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:34.474
from time to time
in Switzerland.

968
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:38.144
I don't know what that means.

969
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.523
I'm intrigued by it.

970
00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.775
still. 40 years later.

971
00:56:47.529 --> 00:56:49.781
I'm not a conspiracy person.

972
00:56:49.823 --> 00:56:53.076
but it does involve my own life.

973
00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:57.330
There's another veil
that has not been uncovered

974
00:56:57.372 --> 00:57:00.125
about what was going on there.

975
00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:03.336
If you could
lift that veil. what
do you think you'd see?

976
00:57:03.378 --> 00:57:06.089
The Timothy Leary story

977
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:09.717
is a very big political story.

978
00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:12.971
A lot of people
have been manipulated

979
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:15.181
to manipulate history.

980
00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:20.395
And the more
I understand this story.

981
00:57:20.437 --> 00:57:22.480
the more I understand

982
00:57:22.522 --> 00:57:25.650
that it's part of a puzzle

983
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:29.112
that's being played out.

984
00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:31.739
The grandiosity of the people

985
00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:33.491
I grew up around

986
00:57:33.533 --> 00:57:35.326
was limitless.

987
00:57:35.368 --> 00:57:38.872
Using people as pawns

988
00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:41.458
was definitely their game.

989
00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:49.966
My step-grandfather
Arpád Plesch

990
00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:53.011
was a very.
very nasty character.

991
00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:58.475
He took money
from the Jewish people

992
00:57:58.516 --> 00:57:59.976
that he knew in Germany.

993
00:58:00.018 --> 00:58:04.105
and he hid the money in
Swiss numbered accounts.

994
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.316
and then he denounced

995
00:58:06.357 --> 00:58:07.984
those people

996
00:58:08.026 --> 00:58:10.361
to the Hitler people.

997
00:58:10.403 --> 00:58:11.946
He was not a Jew. however?

998
00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:15.408
Oh. he was a Jew.
Oh. yes. he was a Jew.

999
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.870
I've seen the absolute depravity

1000
00:58:18.912 --> 00:58:23.708
of the people who have
the most money in this world.

1001
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:25.502
And I've seen

1002
00:58:25.543 --> 00:58:28.463
how there are
no morals whatsoever.

1003
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:29.631
None.

1004
00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:32.383
Money and power.

1005
00:58:32.425 --> 00:58:34.093
and that's it.

1006
00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:39.849
Arpád Plesch was married
to both my mother

1007
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:41.351
and my grandmother.

1008
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:44.687
When my grandmother died.

1009
00:58:44.729 --> 00:58:47.815
I was taken into the garden

1010
00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:51.486
to see Grandpa marrying Mummy.

1011
00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:54.572
And that was all about money...

1012
00:58:56.491 --> 00:58:58.618
and incest.

1013
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.747
Forgive me.
but how was it that
your grandmother died?

1014
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:06.042
When my grandmother
was dying.

1015
00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:09.128
he went to get a knife

1016
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.632
and he plunged into her heart.

1017
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:16.219
I guess my step-grandfather.
stepfather.

1018
00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:19.889
considered that
it was an act of love.

1019
00:59:19.931 --> 00:59:21.933
that he would make sure

1020
00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:24.852
that his wife was dead.

1021
00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:28.690
Your story
seems like a tragedy
out of ancient Greece.

1022
00:59:29.774 --> 00:59:31.568
Well. it's true. my story.

1023
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:34.946
It's true.
It's very strange.

1024
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:37.282
It's absolutely true.

1025
01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:16.070
When we got brought
back to the United States.

1026
01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:20.825
I had no idea
who Timothy Leary was.

1027
01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.702
Guru. folk hero.

1028
01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:26.497
and political resistor.

1029
01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:30.460
Ten days after we got back.

1030
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:35.798
I heard that
Dennis had been captured.

1031
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.260
I went to see him
at the county jail

1032
01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.637
because he was a link

1033
01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:43.723
with that incredible
time in Europe.

1034
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:50.980
Dennis said. "I'll be
getting out in a few days.

1035
01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.607
I'll meet up with you.

1036
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.942
I'll instruct you
about the whole story--

1037
01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.945
who are the villains.
who are the good people."

1038
01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:01.949
All that was a setup.

1039
01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:06.579
Timothy had given me
his address book

1040
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:10.500
with every name
you could imagine

1041
01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:13.544
and said. "Talk to
these people and free me."

1042
01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:18.466
It was an amazing puzzle.

1043
01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:22.261
This is Folsom prison.

1044
01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:25.431
It holds at
the present time 1.800 men.

1045
01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.558
One of them is Timothy Leary.

1046
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.603
He was brought here
after four months
in solitary confinement

1047
01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:33.940
at California Men's Colony
in San Luis Obispo.

1048
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:36.651
I am Joanna Leary.
and I'd like to see him

1049
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.486
out of here
as quick as possible.

1050
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.989
I wrote him every day.

1051
01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.825
and he wrote me every day.

1052
01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:49.330
I coated stamps in acid.

1053
01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.374
He knew

1054
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.084
what was on the stamp.

1055
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:58.256
And then I put these tiny.
little acid

1056
01:01:58.297 --> 01:02:00.007
in my belly button.

1057
01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.927
You see. I have an innie.

1058
01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:06.180
and I never knew how
useful it would become.

1059
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.934
We were allowed to embrace

1060
01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:13.521
in the beginning
and at the end of the visit.

1061
01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:18.943
And I had taken mine

1062
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.446
about ten minutes before.

1063
01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:22.822
When we were kissing.

1064
01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:26.284
I put my hand
up towards his mouth

1065
01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.286
and then I put it in.

1066
01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:31.414
We were both... tripping

1067
01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.499
at Folsom prison.

1068
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.918
It was orgasmic.

1069
01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:46.220
My mother
came to Folsom prison

1070
01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.432
in her Chanel coat.

1071
01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:53.060
She's got her Nancy Reagan
super-coiffed hair.

1072
01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:54.979
She's got her high heels.

1073
01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.734
And her very red nails.

1074
01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.319
She was fine.

1075
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.571
I mean. they frisked her.

1076
01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:04.947
They took her ID.

1077
01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:09.076
And we went down
to the visiting room.

1078
01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:12.288
They greeted each other
like they were

1079
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.832
the oldest of friends.

1080
01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:18.044
Timothy got down on his knees

1081
01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:20.004
in Folsom Prison.

1082
01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:24.175
and he asked my mother
for my hand.

1083
01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:27.720
She told him how crazy
she thought I was.

1084
01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.472
I thought that
there's my mother.

1085
01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.891
jealous of my lovers again.

1086
01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:37.688
Timothy looked
quite like my father.

1087
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:41.818
Lieutenant Commander
Cecil Harcourt-Smith.

1088
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.363
My mother was just

1089
01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:48.157
gaga about him.

1090
01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:50.368
Were you
jealous of your mother?

1091
01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:53.371
At that moment.
was I jealous of my mother?

1092
01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:55.873
Wow.

1093
01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:59.210
I probably was. terribly!

1094
01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.212
I was going to ask you
the generic question.

1095
01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:04.048
What did you learn about sex
from your mother?

1096
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.884
She said that
I had to be very careful

1097
01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:09.178
because when you have sex.

1098
01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.848
you could get syphilis.

1099
01:04:11.889 --> 01:04:16.227
Oh. she didn't tell me
I could get pregnant!

1100
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.229
I take it
you didn't get syphilis.

1101
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.564
but you did get pregnant.

1102
01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:20.898
Yeah.

1103
01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.526
A lot.

1104
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.905
I had to go to her and say.

1105
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.907
"I don't understand.

1106
01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.076
My tummy's getting bigger.

1107
01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:34.245
I'm feeling sick.

1108
01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:36.205
I don't know what's happening."

1109
01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.791
She took me to a doctor
and they took blood.

1110
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.919
and it turned out
I was pregnant.

1111
01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:45.047
I was 15. There was
absolutely no question

1112
01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:47.008
that I was going
to have that child.

1113
01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:50.177
I mean. none whatsoever.

1114
01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:53.097
And then they took me in.
and they took my baby.

1115
01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:00.104
I think I was never
the same again.

1116
01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.525
So after that...

1117
01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:10.948
I was in full seduction mode.

1118
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:15.786
I had to have eight men
at a time to be content.

1119
01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.456
Now. I wasn't having sex
with eight men.

1120
01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:23.127
but I had to have eight
major admirers.

1121
01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:25.963
At night in my bed.
I would count them.

1122
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:29.425
Made me feel warm.
made me feel safe.

1123
01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.135
Made me feel wanted.

1124
01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:34.472
This is Helen Koblin.

1125
01:05:34.513 --> 01:05:37.016
and with me is
Joanna Harcourt-Smith.

1126
01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:40.311
Timothy Leary's woman.
She's trying to help Timothy.

1127
01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.856
He's sitting in the
solitary confinement cell

1128
01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:46.192
just sending out
energy and love

1129
01:05:46.233 --> 01:05:49.362
to whoever wants
to receive it.

1130
01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:42.331
I had a studio

1131
01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.583
under Coit Tower

1132
01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:47.003
in San Francisco.

1133
01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:49.213
Francis Ford Coppola

1134
01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.257
gave me an office

1135
01:06:51.298 --> 01:06:54.135
above the Little Fox Theater.

1136
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.930
the Starseed Information Center.

1137
01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.768
We'd hatch these crazy projects

1138
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.521
to get Timothy out of prison.

1139
01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:10.401
We'll get a helicopter.

1140
01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:14.238
I will be naked

1141
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.365
with black gloves.

1142
01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:18.325
We'll have this huge

1143
01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:21.579
speakers blasting out

1144
01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.664
The Dark Side of the Moon.

1145
01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.417
It would make the guards

1146
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.918
completely numb.

1147
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.838
And so we'd pick Timothy
out of the yard.

1148
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.549
take him into the helicopter.

1149
01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:36.510
We'd go to the mountains nearby.

1150
01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.929
There would be a whole militia

1151
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.265
that would surround us.

1152
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:46.103
Also. the Starseed
Information Center

1153
01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.439
is from where I published

1154
01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.649
five of Timothy's books.

1155
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:59.575
We felt that as long
as he could write books.

1156
01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:02.161
his mind would
not be imprisoned.

1157
01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.166
He would send them to me
in letter form.

1158
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.709
"My darling wife.

1159
01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.586
I miss you more
than life itself.

1160
01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:14.965
The seven circuits
of the human brain are.

1161
01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:17.301
one. blah. blah. blah. Two."

1162
01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:23.891
When I was broke.

1163
01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.770
I would stand on
Telegraph Avenue

1164
01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.605
and I'd sell my books.

1165
01:08:31.315 --> 01:08:33.818
Morning has broken

1166
01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:38.656
Like the first morning...

1167
01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:43.536
One day somebody
introduced me to this man

1168
01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:45.704
we called Franklin.

1169
01:08:45.746 --> 01:08:49.834
because he always had a lot
of hundred-dollar bills.

1170
01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:54.004
He made this acid that
in those days was called

1171
01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:56.006
Clear Light.

1172
01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.592
He would give me these vials.

1173
01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.094
and I'd go around town.

1174
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.680
and I'd give acid to everybody.

1175
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.557
Like. I'd go to the bank.

1176
01:09:04.598 --> 01:09:06.433
and I would give them some acid.

1177
01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.144
And I kid you not.

1178
01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.479
they were not at the bank
the following week.

1179
01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:17.194
One day. Franklin asked me if
I'd take an acid trip with him.

1180
01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:21.115
And then he took me out to this

1181
01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.534
house on the beach.

1182
01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.536
All that was
in the living room

1183
01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.205
was a king-sized bed...

1184
01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:33.961
with a huge American flag on it.

1185
01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:37.214
When the time came
to take the acid...

1186
01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:42.011
I put it on my tongue.

1187
01:09:42.052 --> 01:09:45.181
He did the same thing.
put it on my tongue.

1188
01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:46.932
He licked my tongue.

1189
01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:48.392
I licked his tongue.

1190
01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:53.772
I lay down on
that American flag.

1191
01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:56.233
I was very. very.
very freaked out.

1192
01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.029
Franklin was meditating.

1193
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:04.325
He wasn't really
into having sex.

1194
01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.577
which surprised me a lot.

1195
01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:09.788
But then I went out
on the beach.

1196
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.916
There was this bell...

1197
01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:16.128
...going back and forth.

1198
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:19.131
and a voice came on.

1199
01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:22.009
It was the voice of my mother.

1200
01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:25.429
She was telling me something
that was really important.

1201
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.473
She was saying.

1202
01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:31.518
"You're playing. you're acting.
you're exaggerating."

1203
01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.938
In that moment
I realized she was right.

1204
01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:36.357
that I was playing a role

1205
01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.525
'cause I was afraid.

1206
01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.780
After the trip.

1207
01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:44.615
I said to Franklin.

1208
01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:47.368
"Is there anything
that you need?"

1209
01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:50.704
"Well. I really need
seven pounds

1210
01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.289
of ergotamine

1211
01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:55.793
for my next LSD batch."

1212
01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:59.964
My diabolical mind went
into action immediately--

1213
01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:02.132
"Dr. Schwitzhund

1214
01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:05.261
definitely has ergotamine."

1215
01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:06.762
How did you know this?

1216
01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:10.266
Well. I didn't know this.
I was lying.

1217
01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:12.476
I was lying!

1218
01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.187
He said. "Well.
how much would it cost?"

1219
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:17.523
"$10.000 a pound."

1220
01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:20.526
He said.
"Fine. get it for me."

1221
01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:24.655
Dennis.
the sorcerer's apprentice.

1222
01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:28.617
told me that
the dope dealer trick is

1223
01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:31.036
to get two adjoining rooms.

1224
01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:34.832
and then you get a room
three floors up.

1225
01:11:34.873 --> 01:11:38.544
You give them the key.

1226
01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:40.921
and then you tell them
to go upstairs

1227
01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.840
and get the merchandise.

1228
01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:44.633
They'll come back to the room.

1229
01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:47.177
but you're already
in the adjoining room.

1230
01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.016
I loved Franklin.

1231
01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:57.688
but I desperately needed
the money to free Timothy.

1232
01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:01.275
I got a beautiful
little Halliburton suitcase.

1233
01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:04.445
Timothy had given me
this exquisite

1234
01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:08.198
gold tantric ring.

1235
01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.868
I put all those things
in the suitcase.

1236
01:12:12.953 --> 01:12:15.873
One fine day.

1237
01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:19.293
I made an appointment with him
at this hotel on the wharf.

1238
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:24.548
In the elevator I said to him.

1239
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.760
"Shall we just go
to that room and make love?"

1240
01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:30.721
Was this
just to trick him or--

1241
01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:35.225
No! It was the opposite
of tricking him.

1242
01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:38.395
If we'd made love. I probably
wouldn't have tricked him.

1243
01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:41.398
And who was waiting
in the room next door?

1244
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.360
Dennis.

1245
01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:47.821
Machiavellian Dennis.

1246
01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:55.037
And you would
have made love to Franklin
with Dennis listening?

1247
01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:57.915
Franklin was more important
to me than Dennis.

1248
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.087
So we went to the room.

1249
01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:06.090
and he gave me
this little accordion folder

1250
01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:08.217
with $10.000

1251
01:13:08.258 --> 01:13:10.594
in each space.

1252
01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.012
And then after a while.

1253
01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.555
my lookout told me

1254
01:13:13.597 --> 01:13:16.600
that he had left the building.

1255
01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:20.062
It was late at night by then.

1256
01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.439
And I had somebody drive me

1257
01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.441
to Mill Valley

1258
01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.110
to this lawyer.

1259
01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:28.278
and I knocked like crazy.

1260
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.031
When he opened up.
he was in his robe and...

1261
01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.786
I sat at the kitchen table
with him.

1262
01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:41.917
And I threw the money
on the table.

1263
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.337
"Can you get him out now?"

1264
01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.550
And he said to me. "No.

1265
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.636
it's not a question of money.

1266
01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.972
He's a political prisoner."

1267
01:13:57.182 --> 01:13:59.476
Most of the men
that I model myself after

1268
01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:02.312
have been lucky
if they got away with. uh.

1269
01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.481
just being in prison

1270
01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.984
for their ideas.

1271
01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:03.665
Dennis is
insinuating himself more

1272
01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:05.417
and more
into all of this. no?

1273
01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:09.546
I have pain about it. but...

1274
01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:12.382
may that be present
with us as well.

1275
01:15:12.424 --> 01:15:14.718
I was taking a lot of cocaine.

1276
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.553
Dennis was providing it.

1277
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.223
I was smoking
a lot of cannabis.

1278
01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:21.892
I was drinking
a lot of alcohol.

1279
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.560
On some days I would just

1280
01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:26.230
lie in my--
in my studio.

1281
01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:29.024
watch the Watergate hearings.

1282
01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:32.945
and hope that
something might change.

1283
01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:35.030
But as the case progressed.
it became obvious

1284
01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:36.532
that there were higher-ups.

1285
01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:38.742
men who ordered
the bugging operations

1286
01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.327
and who paid for it.

1287
01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:41.828
And now it takes a scorecard

1288
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:44.206
to keep track
of those connected with it

1289
01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:47.042
in one way or another.

1290
01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.211
Timothy always said that

1291
01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.129
his imprisonment

1292
01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:54.049
would be harder for me
than for him.

1293
01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:58.011
Needless for me to say
to you that. um.

1294
01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.888
I was very sensual.

1295
01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.140
I was 27 years old.

1296
01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:06.061
I had shared with Timothy

1297
01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:09.106
that I was going to have sex.

1298
01:16:09.147 --> 01:16:12.859
It was the time of free love.

1299
01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:15.821
and he was the bishop
of free love.

1300
01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.826
I imagined myself
as Scheherazade.

1301
01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:25.080
I wouldn't tell him
who it was.

1302
01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:26.790
but I'd describe

1303
01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:30.711
how I'd made love
with another person.

1304
01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.921
One time it might be a woman.

1305
01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.173
one time it was a hermaphrodite.

1306
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.886
Dennis was one of the people
I had sex with.

1307
01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.933
After a while.
he said to me that

1308
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:48.770
he was working as an informant
for the government.

1309
01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:51.648
Timothy should get out that way

1310
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:55.902
because he won't get out
any other way.

1311
01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:59.823
I passed on that information
to him a couple of times.

1312
01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.242
I had no idea
of the implications.

1313
01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.744
Really?

1314
01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.288
None!

1315
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:10.167
You have to understand
how incredibly naive I was.

1316
01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.463
I always wondered why

1317
01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:18.925
one Thursday I went
to see him at Vacaville

1318
01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.844
and he said.

1319
01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.681
"Send a telegram to the FBI

1320
01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:27.643
and tell them
I'm ready to cooperate."

1321
01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.645
People have accused me

1322
01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:32.356
of being the one
who made him do it.

1323
01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:36.276
That's impossible.

1324
01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:39.321
That's the story
of The Blue Angel.

1325
01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.823
the sexy singer

1326
01:17:41.865 --> 01:17:45.452
who perverts the professor.

1327
01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.079
No!

1328
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.040
That's ridiculous!

1329
01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.503
I was like
Alice in Wonderland.

1330
01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:57.839
I didn't have
any point of reference.

1331
01:17:58.965 --> 01:18:01.301
I didn't realize

1332
01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.929
how alien I was.

1333
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.225
To Allen Ginsberg.

1334
01:18:08.266 --> 01:18:10.769
I was not fit

1335
01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:13.230
to be the next acid queen.

1336
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.528
By then I was living
in Mill Valley.

1337
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.158
I sent this telegram

1338
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.494
to the FBI:

1339
01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:31.081
"Timothy ready
to cooperate with government."

1340
01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.917
Couple of days after that.

1341
01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:37.337
FBI agents came from Chicago

1342
01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:41.508
because that's where they were
searching for the Weathermen.

1343
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:46.722
And they knew
that Timothy was connected
to the Weathermen.

1344
01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:50.267
They had helped him
escape from prison.

1345
01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.437
They brought me in.

1346
01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:55.647
He asked me if I'd be willing

1347
01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:59.901
to work for his release.

1348
01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:04.573
There was no limits
to my stand-by-your-man.

1349
01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:07.868
No limits.

1350
01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:10.912
By then we had been
talking of having a baby.

1351
01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:13.540
We had named the baby.

1352
01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.958
What was the name?

1353
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.251
It was going to be a girl.

1354
01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.795
and her name was going
to be Chrysalis.

1355
01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.258
No abbreviation to Chrys.

1356
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.885
Chrysalis.

1357
01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.762
You have to know that after

1358
01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:29.055
visiting your man in prison

1359
01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:32.434
and seeing how
all appeals were refused.

1360
01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:35.395
Lawyers didn't know
how to get him out.

1361
01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:41.318
I would do anything.
anything at all.

1362
01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:44.738
The DEA had me

1363
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.116
completely at their mercy.

1364
01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:51.495
They used me as Mata Hari.

1365
01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:53.455
They used me to go after

1366
01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.749
the counterculture lawyers.

1367
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:59.503
Call being made by SR14X037
to George Chula's office.

1368
01:20:17.854 --> 01:20:19.397
So. I had dinner with him.

1369
01:20:19.439 --> 01:20:22.651
I asked him if the next time
we got together

1370
01:20:22.692 --> 01:20:25.028
he could bring me
a gram of cocaine.

1371
01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.324
And when we had dinner.
I was wired.

1372
01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:32.118
They put a box on my leg.

1373
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.539
chose very sexy clothes for me.

1374
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:39.084
and they recorded
the conversation.

1375
01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:43.547
I behaved very femme fatale.

1376
01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:47.133
extremely flirtatious.

1377
01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:48.552
seductive.

1378
01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:51.680
and dangerous.

1379
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:54.766
You can have me.
but you can't keep me.

1380
01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:40.103
And it was kind of the same
thing as with Franklin.

1381
01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:44.441
They got two rooms
at the Disneyland Hotel.

1382
01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:46.610
In one room. they had
all their machines

1383
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:48.528
and setups and all of that.

1384
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:52.866
I was supposed to receive
Chula in the other room.

1385
01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.868
He said to me on the phone

1386
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.913
he stopped somewhere.

1387
01:21:57.954 --> 01:22:00.290
and a lifeguard on the beach

1388
01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:03.460
said to him that
he had a walkie-talkie...

1389
01:22:04.502 --> 01:22:06.463
and there were federal agents.

1390
01:22:06.504 --> 01:22:09.090
and they were having
an incredible conversation

1391
01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:11.343
about how they
were going to bust him.

1392
01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:16.681
And this
lifeguard on the beach

1393
01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:19.809
had picked up the signal.

1394
01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:21.811
and they were overjubilant

1395
01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:25.941
that they were going to arrest
Timothy Leary's lawyer.

1396
01:22:25.982 --> 01:22:28.443
So in the end. he never came.

1397
01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:33.865
But on the night that
we were at the restaurant.

1398
01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:37.202
he had given me
a little cocaine.

1399
01:22:37.243 --> 01:22:40.538
and I turned that over
to the agents.

1400
01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.999
The main agent's name was

1401
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:46.294
Donald E. Strange.

1402
01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:48.672
This is Dr. Timothy Leary.

1403
01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:49.923
How are you?

1404
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.466
Hello. Don.

1405
01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:53.843
We're going to talk
a little bit about. uh.

1406
01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:57.430
Dr. Leary and the things
he's been doing. uh.

1407
01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.641
since 1960.

1408
01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:02.268
And just how he--

1409
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.938
he came to the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

1410
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.691
Well. I had been away
from the United States

1411
01:23:07.732 --> 01:23:09.943
for about
two-and-a-half years.

1412
01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.028
And when the plane landed

1413
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.863
on the Los Angeles runway.

1414
01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:15.865
the first person
I met was Don Strange.

1415
01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:18.702
who welcomed me
with handcuffs.

1416
01:23:18.743 --> 01:23:20.161
I felt basically relieved

1417
01:23:20.203 --> 01:23:21.538
uh. to be back.

1418
01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:23.748
I felt that the work
I had to do

1419
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:27.168
and the process
of reconciliation

1420
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.213
and of dialogue of
constructive activity

1421
01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:31.715
that had to be done

1422
01:23:31.756 --> 01:23:33.383
was going
to take place here.

1423
01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:40.098
They moved Timothy

1424
01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:44.894
to the rural prison

1425
01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:47.439
near Sacramento.

1426
01:23:49.065 --> 01:23:53.319
I wasn't allowed to go
out of my apartment.

1427
01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.740
except with a federal agent.

1428
01:23:56.781 --> 01:24:00.160
They said that
it was dangerous for me.

1429
01:24:01.619 --> 01:24:04.581
They decided they
should change my name.

1430
01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:07.542
So one day.

1431
01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:10.420
this big.
tall U.S. Marshal said.

1432
01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:13.048
"Now your name
from now on will be

1433
01:24:13.089 --> 01:24:16.176
Virginia Church."

1434
01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.178
What was Leary's name?

1435
01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.679
Charlie Thrush.

1436
01:24:20.972 --> 01:24:23.266
And they published in Newsweek

1437
01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:27.103
that Timothy
had became a snitch.

1438
01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:29.481
a government informant.

1439
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.234
I thought--

1440
01:24:33.276 --> 01:24:37.781
I was trying to get
Timothy out of prison.

1441
01:24:37.822 --> 01:24:41.743
but they used me
to discredit him.

1442
01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:44.954
This is a press
conference that I wish

1443
01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:46.581
was not taking place.

1444
01:24:46.623 --> 01:24:49.417
It is a symptom
of the credibility crisis

1445
01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:52.253
in America
symbolized by Watergate

1446
01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:55.882
and President Ford's
pardoning of Richard Nixon.

1447
01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:58.343
There's a straight line
between Watergate

1448
01:24:58.384 --> 01:24:59.886
and Timothy Leary.

1449
01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.305
The very same
Justice Department

1450
01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:05.642
has both forced and persuaded

1451
01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:08.728
Timothy Leary
to lie and fabricate

1452
01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.898
elaborate stories
to get out of jail.

1453
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.651
Leary's new girlfriend.
Joanna Harcourt-Smith.

1454
01:25:14.692 --> 01:25:18.321
declared that Leary
would not remain in prison.

1455
01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:20.323
Harcourt-Smith said
that Leary was willing

1456
01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.575
to make a deal
with the government.

1457
01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:26.454
When Timothy
was in this rural prison.

1458
01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:28.623
they moved me from the apartment

1459
01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.750
into the home

1460
01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.128
of the U.S. Marshal--

1461
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:36.840
Art Van Court
and his wife Marcia.

1462
01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:41.719
Although they're keeping me
in protective custody.

1463
01:25:41.761 --> 01:25:45.098
it felt kind of good
to have home-cooked meals

1464
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.350
and be with a regular family.

1465
01:25:49.018 --> 01:25:53.773
One day. I went to see
Timothy at the small jail.

1466
01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:57.777
and as we were embracing.
he whispered.

1467
01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.154
"G-U-N."

1468
01:25:59.195 --> 01:26:02.073
Because what if
they read his lips?

1469
01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:06.327
I said to Dennis.

1470
01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:09.205
"Where can I find a gun?"

1471
01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:11.708
He took me to this garage...

1472
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.961
just like in the movies.

1473
01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:19.007
Greasy man with his jumpsuit.

1474
01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:21.801
I thought I had
to play the game.

1475
01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.554
and I sat on his lap.

1476
01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:27.307
I gave him $100.

1477
01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:29.601
and he gave me a little gun.

1478
01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:32.395
I couldn't take it anymore--

1479
01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:34.063
the snitching

1480
01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:35.899
and the setting people up.

1481
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.068
I was ready to kill everybody.

1482
01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:44.991
In the beginning.
when Timothy escaped.

1483
01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:49.120
the Weathermen took him
to a safe house

1484
01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:51.080
in Oregon.

1485
01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:54.959
The FBI wanted
Timothy to show them

1486
01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:58.254
where the safe house was.

1487
01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:01.174
And we had to drive
through San Francisco.

1488
01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.884
I don't know why.

1489
01:27:03.843 --> 01:27:06.262
And all of a sudden.

1490
01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:09.724
this huge .357 Magnum

1491
01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:12.936
comes floating under the seat.

1492
01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:15.730
right to Timothy's foot.

1493
01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:18.608
And I thought.
"This is meant to be."

1494
01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.401
Now we have two guns.

1495
01:27:20.443 --> 01:27:22.028
and we're going to be free.

1496
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.993
And he was reading
the San Francisco Chronicle.

1497
01:27:32.997 --> 01:27:34.540
And he wrapped the gun up.

1498
01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:37.710
and he handed it
back over to the agent.

1499
01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:39.587
Somehow I realized that

1500
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:41.881
this was just a dream.

1501
01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:44.133
a crazy. maniac.

1502
01:27:44.175 --> 01:27:46.135
insane dream.

1503
01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:52.976
So we proceeded
through the forests of Oregon.

1504
01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:54.769
We got out of the car

1505
01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:56.187
and Timothy said to me.

1506
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:59.399
"Do you realize
that if we kill them.

1507
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.111
we'll have to kill
everybody we meet

1508
01:28:03.152 --> 01:28:04.988
until they kill us."

1509
01:28:05.029 --> 01:28:07.699
And at that moment.
I lifted my head

1510
01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:11.286
and the FBI agent
was right in front of us.

1511
01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:13.997
And he said.

1512
01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:16.666
"Do you mind if I shoot you?"

1513
01:28:22.505 --> 01:28:25.341
Did you ever find
the Weathermen house?

1514
01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:29.554
I don't remember.

1515
01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:34.017
At some point.

1516
01:28:34.058 --> 01:28:35.685
Dennis became so annoying

1517
01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:40.481
about the fact that
I should be only with him.

1518
01:28:40.523 --> 01:28:42.942
he wrote a letter

1519
01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:45.236
to the U.S. Marshal saying

1520
01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:48.906
that I'd been
having sex with him.

1521
01:28:48.948 --> 01:28:51.951
My love for Timothy
was untrue.

1522
01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.537
It was like
my world collapsed.

1523
01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:58.416
I went back to Marbella.

1524
01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:01.461
to my mother's house.

1525
01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:04.255
and one day Dennis
showed up at the door.

1526
01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.887
He asked my mother
if he could marry me.

1527
01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:16.934
My mother said.
"Who do you think you are?

1528
01:29:16.976 --> 01:29:19.354
The son of a hairdresser?

1529
01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:22.231
Never in the world!"

1530
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.906
A couple of days later.

1531
01:29:29.947 --> 01:29:33.576
I was going to a fabulous party.

1532
01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:37.288
Adnan Khashoggi
gave me a couple of Quaaludes.

1533
01:29:38.289 --> 01:29:39.999
From then on.

1534
01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.878
I'm not quite sure
what I did.

1535
01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:49.592
But the next morning.
I called my mother.

1536
01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:52.095
She said. "Dennis is dead."

1537
01:29:55.264 --> 01:29:56.682
I felt he was killed.

1538
01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:59.519
You know. don't ask me
for any proof.

1539
01:30:00.686 --> 01:30:03.147
I went to his room.

1540
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:05.233
There were pills.

1541
01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:08.069
but they were half full.

1542
01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:11.614
And that really set off
a bug in my ear.

1543
01:30:13.282 --> 01:30:15.159
Then there was his diary.

1544
01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:19.122
The last words were.

1545
01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:29.549
Please don't let on

1546
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.801
That you knew me when

1547
01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:33.761
I was hungry

1548
01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:36.848
And it was your world

1549
01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:40.393
Ah. you fake

1550
01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.979
Just like a woman

1551
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.064
Yes. you do

1552
01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:46.482
You make love

1553
01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:49.402
Just like a woman

1554
01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.112
Yes. you do

1555
01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:56.159
Then you ache
just like a woman

1556
01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:01.998
But you break just
like a little girl

1557
01:31:02.039 --> 01:31:03.499
One day.

1558
01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:07.336
after a little over
three and a half years.

1559
01:31:07.378 --> 01:31:09.338
he got out of prison.

1560
01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:12.008
Neurology lives!

1561
01:31:12.049 --> 01:31:13.885
How you feel. Tim?

1562
01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:15.344
-I feel beautiful.
-Great.

1563
01:31:15.386 --> 01:31:18.139
I want to thank Joanna
and Mr. Milano

1564
01:31:18.181 --> 01:31:21.684
and all my friends
who helped me get out.

1565
01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:23.853
And to those who didn't help.

1566
01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.521
I want to be reassuring.

1567
01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:27.356
it's all going
to work out all right.

1568
01:31:27.398 --> 01:31:28.691
And in particular.

1569
01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.818
I want to send
a message of support

1570
01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:34.113
to Andrei Sakharov. who's doing
the same thing in Russia.

1571
01:31:38.409 --> 01:31:40.203
Have a good time!

1572
01:31:41.537 --> 01:31:43.706
- Bless you. Tim.

1573
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:49.504
I had reserved a room
at the Valencia Hotel

1574
01:31:49.545 --> 01:31:52.548
in La Jolla.

1575
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:55.843
We went to the restaurant
in the hotel.

1576
01:31:55.885 --> 01:31:59.472
and I think he must
have ordered everything
that was on the menu.

1577
01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:02.975
He was a very elegant man.

1578
01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:06.479
but I'll tell you. that night.
he was eating like a pig.

1579
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:10.900
It was a joy to see him
taste real life again.

1580
01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:12.568
We went to bed.

1581
01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:15.071
and in the morning.
there was a big...

1582
01:32:15.112 --> 01:32:17.865
-...loud knock on the door.

1583
01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:21.410
It was the U.S. Marshals again.

1584
01:32:21.452 --> 01:32:24.914
"We need to put you in
the Witness Protection Program

1585
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.624
because otherwise

1586
01:32:26.666 --> 01:32:29.335
you're going to end up
on a slab."

1587
01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:36.759
They said to Timothy.
"We're going to relocate you
in Salt Lake City."

1588
01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:38.427
And he didn't miss a beat:

1589
01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:41.138
"Do you think you could change
that for Santa Fe?"

1590
01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.432
And they started making calls.

1591
01:32:43.474 --> 01:32:45.810
Santa Fe it was.

1592
01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:52.525
We were in an "A"-frame cabin
out in the wilderness.

1593
01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:57.780
No electricity. no gas.

1594
01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:59.782
That was very unfamiliar to me.

1595
01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:03.286
I mean. to this day
I've never camped.

1596
01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:05.246
I'm a Parisian.

1597
01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:10.293
All I knew was.
lie in the forest naked

1598
01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:12.962
and get brown under the sun.

1599
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.636
I'm fond of saying that
I became a better Timothy Leary

1600
01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:23.431
than Timothy Leary himself.

1601
01:33:23.472 --> 01:33:26.767
I had traveled to colleges...

1602
01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:29.979
given lectures.

1603
01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:32.648
shown the Folsom film.

1604
01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:35.818
pleaded for his release.

1605
01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:40.031
I wonder if there was
room for two Timothy Learys.

1606
01:33:40.072 --> 01:33:42.533
One night.

1607
01:33:42.575 --> 01:33:44.493
we had a terrible fight.

1608
01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:54.128
And in the morning
he was gone.

1609
01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.676
To this day.
I don't understand it.

1610
01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:05.264
We never got back together.

1611
01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.270
I thought

1612
01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:14.106
he would protect me

1613
01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:16.192
for the rest of my life.

1614
01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:21.238
I thought I was safe.

1615
01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:27.036
And I don't know
why he went away.

1616
01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:49.225
Every year that goes by.

1617
01:34:49.266 --> 01:34:51.519
I love my mother more.

1618
01:34:52.978 --> 01:34:57.566
My mother smoked these
Winstons endlessly.

1619
01:34:59.276 --> 01:35:01.654
She had a big tumor

1620
01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:04.156
between her lungs.

1621
01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.242
It was inoperable.

1622
01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:10.287
I made her go
to Mercy Hospital.

1623
01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:17.169
And she said. "This is
a very. very bad hotel.

1624
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:19.255
I want you to pack
the suitcases.

1625
01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:21.298
and we're leaving.

1626
01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:28.055
This is the worst hotel
I've been in.

1627
01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:30.266
And open everything."

1628
01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.436
I opened the windows.

1629
01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:35.771
I opened the door.

1630
01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:38.524
I was holding her hand.

1631
01:35:39.608 --> 01:35:42.278
And it was clear
to me the moment

1632
01:35:42.319 --> 01:35:44.947
she stopped breathing.

1633
01:35:46.323 --> 01:35:49.452
She took a breath.
but there was no exhale.

1634
01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:54.415
And then this one tear

1635
01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:56.792
came rolling down her cheek.

1636
01:35:58.210 --> 01:36:00.463
One question
I have to ask you

1637
01:36:00.504 --> 01:36:03.966
which I'm sure everyone
is asking you themselves.

1638
01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:06.051
and that is. Why?

1639
01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.386
Why are you doing this?

1640
01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.972
Why are you
working with DEA.

1641
01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:13.476
the government.
at this point?

1642
01:36:13.517 --> 01:36:15.311
I can understand
that there might be

1643
01:36:15.352 --> 01:36:17.730
some skepticism
that I'm simply here

1644
01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.648
talking to you because

1645
01:36:19.690 --> 01:36:21.650
I'm under prison sentence.

1646
01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:24.737
I want to reassure everyone
that I'm not brainwashed.

1647
01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:28.157
No promises
have been made to me

1648
01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:30.075
by any law enforcement agency.

1649
01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:33.162
The future is much
too important

1650
01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:35.581
to be ruled by the past.

1651
01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:38.834
The war is over.
and I'm glad.

1652
01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:41.796
and I'm ready for
a long period of. uh.

1653
01:36:41.837 --> 01:36:43.672
harmonious peace.

1654
01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:50.346
I have nothing else.

1655
01:36:50.387 --> 01:36:53.724
That was a--
that was a good ending.

1656
01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:56.185
Two years ago.

1657
01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:59.313
I received an email

1658
01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:01.315
from somebody who said.

1659
01:37:01.357 --> 01:37:03.025
"My mother died.

1660
01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:05.820
and I have a bunch of boxes

1661
01:37:05.861 --> 01:37:07.488
that belonged to you.

1662
01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:09.698
Would you like me
to send them to you?"

1663
01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:17.373
He wrote me these
divine letters in prison.

1664
01:37:17.414 --> 01:37:19.542
and I had lost them.

1665
01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:24.129
And I felt really.
really ashamed.

1666
01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.714
I was rather broke.

1667
01:37:25.756 --> 01:37:27.967
but not broken at the time.

1668
01:37:30.386 --> 01:37:33.138
And sure enough.
the 130 letters

1669
01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.307
that he had written
to me were there

1670
01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:38.060
in that yellow folder
I put them in.

1671
01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:42.523
And there were
four reel-to-reel tapes

1672
01:37:42.565 --> 01:37:46.652
that a psychologist in Vacaville

1673
01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.696
had brought these tapes to me

1674
01:37:48.737 --> 01:37:52.741
and said. "Timothy wants you
to have these and keep them."

1675
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:59.498
And at the time I was so busy
with the real Timothy.

1676
01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:02.585
I didn't listen to the tapes.

1677
01:38:02.626 --> 01:38:05.004
So I spent all last winter

1678
01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:07.923
listening to ten hours.

1679
01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.553
He was very brilliant.
you see.

1680
01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:16.181
He actually got himself

1681
01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:18.142
moved to Vacaville.

1682
01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.439
He seduced

1683
01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.276
two psychologists there.
a man and a woman.

1684
01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:29.194
At a certain point...

1685
01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:32.448
he says.

1686
01:38:32.489 --> 01:38:35.326
"Well. what are they going
to do with me?"

1687
01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:40.956
Wesley Hiler says.

1688
01:38:40.998 --> 01:38:43.542
"We're going to drug
you more and more.

1689
01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:46.795
put you in a special section
in San Quentin...

1690
01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:51.175
where we keep people

1691
01:38:51.216 --> 01:38:52.676
who've lost their mind."

1692
01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:57.056
And I firmly believe
that the next Thursday.

1693
01:38:57.097 --> 01:39:01.268
he said. "Call the FBI.
tell them I'm ready."

1694
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:05.272
What a life would it be for him
to live without his mind?

1695
01:39:07.399 --> 01:39:09.401
So after 40 years.

1696
01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:12.154
for me the mystery is solved.

1697
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:35.844
My ego was pulverized

1698
01:39:35.886 --> 01:39:38.722
by this adventure.

1699
01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:44.645
I was insane. I knew it.

1700
01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:50.150
But I wasn't going to let
anybody lock me up.

1701
01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.490
And I was smart enough

1702
01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:58.659
to go down to the Caribbean.

1703
01:39:58.701 --> 01:40:00.703
buy a sailboat.

1704
01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:03.288
and sail for a long time.

1705
01:40:05.749 --> 01:40:08.419
The ocean rebuilt me.

1706
01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:14.717
There was something
bigger than me.
