This is day 20.000.

I'm the last surviving

This is day 20.802.

13
00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:02.545
Oh. wait.

14
00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:04.305
20.803.

15
00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.482
The Exiles have
taken everything.

16
00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:11.278
Earth is in ruins.

17
00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:16.524
If there are any Colonials
out there. please respond.

18
00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:03.528
Sunshine!

19
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:04.908
Sunshine!

20
00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:08.153
Still
not waking up. huh?

21
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.018
Well. I've got
something for you.

22
00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:13.469
Hey!

23
00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:14.987
Hey. stop!

24
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.473
I asked nicely.
but you didn't wake up.

25
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:18.543
Spark!

26
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:19.613
I will end you!

27
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.995
You've programmed
me to wake you up

28
00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:26.344
at approximately 6:00
AM every morning.

29
00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:29.312
yet you still sleep
in like a teenager.

30
00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:34.248
If I was born your parent. I'd
show you the meaning of an-

31
00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:35.974
Alarm clocks!

32
00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.287
I'll show
you something alarming.

33
00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:43.706
Your move.

34
00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:48.780
I will end you!

35
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.196
Dad?

36
00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:52.439
Hey. son.

37
00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:55.235
Uh. wow. You look.
uh. interesting.

38
00:03:55.373 --> 00:03:58.099
Hey. sweetie. Oh. I
think your hair looks cute.

39
00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:58.928
Ah.

40
00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:00.240
Yeah.

41
00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:03.657
Uh. Dad. like. why
did we allow our robots

42
00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.486
to have so much personality?

43
00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:07.212
That robot. Spark.

44
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.352
is there to keep you
disciplined. son.

45
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.424
Eugh. More like a babysitter.

46
00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:15.255
Listen. your role
in this mission.

47
00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:17.429
it will determine
the fate of humanity.

48
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.813
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I got this. Pops.

49
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.782
Sweetie. how are you getting
on with Allie and Jesse?

50
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.922
Uh.

51
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.234
- What?
- Look.

52
00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:30.131
we're kind of in the middle
of something.

53
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.754
Just...
All right.

54
00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:34.584
As I was saying.
this mission also determines

55
00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:38.139
whether or not you will become
a full-fledged Colonial.

56
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.071
All Right!

57
00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:41.936
I heard you. Don't worry. guys.

58
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.182
Okay. I promise. when I
land. I'll send you a full.

59
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.047
detailed report of
my discoveries. okay?

60
00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:50.635
So. uh...

61
00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:52.395
- Son?
- Tell Mom I love her.

62
00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.536
and I'm on the way to
the hangar for inspection.

63
00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:57.020
Honey. do
you know where...

64
00:04:57.158 --> 00:04:58.815
- Dad?
- I don't know.

65
00:04:58.953 --> 00:05:00.058
Do you you swipe right.

66
00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:01.577
- Dad?
- I win!

67
00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:02.612
Whoa!

68
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.062
Spark!

69
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.235
No! No!

70
00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:13.623
What's going on in here?

71
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:15.901
- Are we done?
- Um. Allie and Jesse.

72
00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.317
Are you good?

73
00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:19.560
Well. more
like babysitter.

74
00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:20.768
All right. Spark?

75
00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:22.701
I make us look good.

76
00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:23.944
So before landing.

77
00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:26.533
a full inspection of
the XJ2 must be completed

78
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:29.329
according to Section
267. Subsection 45.

79
00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:30.330
Question.

80
00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.194
No.

81
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.576
Um. also. I've done
the liberty of preparing
your MLWs.

82
00:05:35.714 --> 00:05:37.406
What's an MLW?

83
00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:39.787
Oh my God. okay.
Mission log watch.

84
00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:41.237
Does it come with a
built-in alarm clock

85
00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.066
that doesn't float around?

86
00:05:43.204 --> 00:05:46.932
Does it come with a
human that enjoys robot urine?

87
00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:50.591
Can we stay
focused children. okay?

88
00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.041
We're about to
enter Earth's orbit.

89
00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.250
and that means we graduate.
complete the mission.

90
00:05:54.388 --> 00:05:55.389
become full-fledged Colonials.

91
00:05:55.527 --> 00:05:57.667
and you are not screwing
it up up for me.

92
00:05:57.805 --> 00:06:01.361
I've taken the liberty
of developing a weapon

93
00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.709
for the XJ2 that's made
of Martian element.

94
00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:05.848
- All right.
- Right?

95
00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:06.642
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.919
- Okay.
- Okay.

97
00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:09.852
So that means she's
ready to go. right?

98
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.993
- Ready to go.
- Inspection over!

99
00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:24.245
Does it have a cup holder?

100
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.903
Yeah. The only thing
she's missing is a pilot.

101
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.596
So our weapons.
um.

102
00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:33.634
they can. like. totally
eliminate Exile forces. right?

103
00:06:33.772 --> 00:06:36.603
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that. but obviously.

104
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:38.087
Great.

105
00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:39.606
So besides the mission.
be careful where you-

106
00:06:40.848 --> 00:06:41.953
Whoa!

107
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:49.512
What's going on?

108
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.550
That. my friends. was
the shockwave of a solar flare.

109
00:06:52.688 --> 00:06:54.172
Before the ship
went offline.

110
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.624
I tapped into the ship's
sensory system. and it turns out

111
00:06:57.762 --> 00:07:01.697
we just flew right into a
hidden EMP barrier of sorts.

112
00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:06.356
Let's get to the command room

113
00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:08.082
and figure out what's
actually going on.

114
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.014
Silas?

115
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:11.914
- Uh-
- Let's go.

116
00:07:12.052 --> 00:07:14.054
Everybody. just.
you know. stay calm.

117
00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:15.055
Let's not jump-

118
00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:20.750
That was not an EMP! That
was a ship attacking us!

119
00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:32.382
Is this thing ready to fly?

120
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:33.832
Ready as it'll ever be.

121
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.869
All right. I'm taking her out.

122
00:07:36.007 --> 00:07:38.630
Everyone. to your
stations! Pronto!

123
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:45.844
Spark?

124
00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:47.156
Silas?

125
00:07:47.294 --> 00:07:48.744
We've got a love/hate
relationship. but I-

126
00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:51.091
Well. that
makes one of us.

127
00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:06.175
Bet you wish you
had a suit like this.

128
00:08:06.313 --> 00:08:09.454
Bet you wish you
hadn't shrunk your jacket.

129
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.663
It looks like the EMP disabled

130
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:12.906
most of our ship's controls.

131
00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:15.391
Ah! Our shields
are completely down!

132
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:16.357
Yeah?

133
00:08:17.255 --> 00:08:18.774
Not only that. but.

134
00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:20.810
we have no control
to ship's trajectory.

135
00:08:20.948 --> 00:08:22.709
What are we gonna do
about the rogue ship?

136
00:08:22.847 --> 00:08:24.193
The only thing we can do.

137
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:27.714
We have to send Silas
out to intercept.

138
00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.910
Help! Help!

139
00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:53.153
We just got hit again!

140
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:54.844
Yeah. they just hit
the starboard side.

141
00:08:54.982 --> 00:08:56.156
That's where Silas is.

142
00:08:56.294 --> 00:08:57.606
Silas!

143
00:08:57.744 --> 00:08:58.710
Silas!

144
00:08:58.848 --> 00:09:00.229
You good? You good?

145
00:09:00.367 --> 00:09:01.610
I can't stop spinning!

146
00:09:01.748 --> 00:09:04.613
This suit's about to
become a vomit comet!

147
00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:06.166
Can you make it to the XJ2?

148
00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:08.686
Uh. uh. I think so.

149
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.071
Help!

150
00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:18.868
Whoa!

151
00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:26.945
Come on!

152
00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.120
What's wrong with this
junker? Nothing's working.

153
00:09:30.293 --> 00:09:32.054
Do you even
have your license?

154
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.713
Come on!

155
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.507
Did you type in
the authorization code?

156
00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:43.893
I think that EMP
might've done her in.

157
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:46.171
Ah. there has to be some way

158
00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:47.828
to spark this junker into life.

159
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.488
Don't you even...

160
00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.490
Whoa! Whoa!

161
00:09:57.873 --> 00:09:59.253
Yes!

162
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.600
If I knew you
were gonna make that move...

163
00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:03.154
We are in

164
00:10:05.052 --> 00:10:06.226
business. baby!

165
00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:24.900
I told you she was
state of the art.

166
00:10:25.038 --> 00:10:27.627
Uh. I hate to crash
your party. but. uh.

167
00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:29.939
we're about to enter
Earth's gravitational pull.

168
00:10:31.182 --> 00:10:32.804
Once we enter there.
there's no escaping.

169
00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:55.378
Uh. should we jump
in with Silas?

170
00:10:55.516 --> 00:10:56.310
Jess?

171
00:10:58.209 --> 00:11:00.970
Jess? Should we
jump in with Silas?

172
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:05.078
I think we're out of time.

173
00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:40.509
You're alive. Darn.

174
00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:44.962
You!

175
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.068
Did you hit me with
that. that ship?

176
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.277
What?

177
00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:51.278
Huh?

178
00:13:52.728 --> 00:13:54.868
What's going on
down there. Zoe?

179
00:13:55.006 --> 00:13:57.595
Well. he's not
dead. unfortunately.

180
00:13:59.942 --> 00:14:00.667
Who's not dead?

181
00:14:01.668 --> 00:14:03.221
Who are you talking to? Huh?

182
00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:05.845
Who is he?

183
00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:08.399
Is he an Exile?

184
00:14:09.296 --> 00:14:10.159
Doubtful?

185
00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.060
Are you sniffing dirt?

186
00:14:14.198 --> 00:14:16.338
You don't
think he's a...

187
00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:18.098
Don't say it.

188
00:14:18.236 --> 00:14:19.720
Colonial?

189
00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:23.517
No. there's no
way this little twerp

190
00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:24.691
could be one of them.

191
00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:27.625
One of who?

192
00:14:27.763 --> 00:14:29.109
What's your name. soldier?

193
00:14:29.247 --> 00:14:30.041
Uh...

194
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:32.906
I. uh...

195
00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:35.805
I don't know.

196
00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:39.913
Well. usually soldiers' names
are written on the dog tag.

197
00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:49.509
Silas?

198
00:14:49.647 --> 00:14:51.925
Good. Glad you
figured out your name.

199
00:14:52.063 --> 00:14:53.789
Now. do you even know
where you're at?

200
00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.239
I'm sure you can tell me.

201
00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:04.938
I want you to listen
closely. all right?

202
00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:09.701
You see that smoke coming
off your ship there? Hmm?

203
00:15:11.289 --> 00:15:12.635
That can be seen for miles.

204
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.709
Zoey. we might
have company coming.

205
00:15:17.847 --> 00:15:19.228
Can you wrap it up down there?

206
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:20.989
What do you see?

207
00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:31.585
It's an Exile drone.
Get out of there now!

208
00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.415
Copy that. We'll leave now.

209
00:15:33.553 --> 00:15:35.624
You better
make it back. Zoey.

210
00:15:36.487 --> 00:15:37.315
Hey!

211
00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:39.628
Where are you going?

212
00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:50.397
Hey. where are you going?

213
00:15:52.261 --> 00:15:54.436
They're coming. We need
to get outta here quickly.

214
00:15:54.574 --> 00:15:55.437
Who is they?

215
00:15:55.575 --> 00:15:57.163
The Exiles. You wanna live?

216
00:15:57.301 --> 00:15:59.199
I suggest you come with me.
What. come with you?

217
00:15:59.337 --> 00:16:01.684
The one who threw
water over my face?

218
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:16.803
Get in!

219
00:16:29.609 --> 00:16:31.611
I'm going as fast as I can.

220
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:33.647
Man. I hate this thing.

221
00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:43.899
Do you even know how
to fly this POSJ?

222
00:16:44.037 --> 00:16:44.831
POSJ?

223
00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:46.936
Yeah. piece of space junk.

224
00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:19.072
I'm fine.
you're. fine. we're fine.

225
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.419
Will you be quiet?

226
00:17:45.478 --> 00:17:47.721
Hold on. spaceman!

227
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:10.537
Hold on! We're getting
of the main road!

228
00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:24.275
No. no. no! This
isn't working!

229
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.279
That's a wall.

230
00:18:32.801 --> 00:18:33.629
Wall!!!

231
00:18:39.428 --> 00:18:42.673
Know how to use one
of these. soldier?

232
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.468
You're a soldier. right?

233
00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:45.434
Yeah.

234
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.367
Yeah. sure.

235
00:18:48.748 --> 00:18:49.921
Die!

236
00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:51.130
Die!

237
00:18:51.268 --> 00:18:52.096
Die!

238
00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:57.722
Die!

239
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.379
Hey!

240
00:18:59.517 --> 00:19:00.691
Give me that.

241
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:08.768
It wasn't that hard.

242
00:20:29.262 --> 00:20:30.884
Cyrus. this is absurd.

243
00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:33.266
We're the most advanced
civilization in the galaxy.

244
00:20:33.404 --> 00:20:36.407
and we can't even get a
signal through to our son.

245
00:20:36.545 --> 00:20:37.995
He may be in danger.

246
00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:40.480
Let's not jump to
conclusions. honey.

247
00:20:40.618 --> 00:20:41.895
I'm sure Silas is fine.

248
00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:42.931
You don't know that.

249
00:20:43.069 --> 00:20:43.863
I do know that.

250
00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:46.245
He is piloting the most

251
00:20:46.383 --> 00:20:48.350
technologically-advanced
ship in our fleet.

252
00:20:48.488 --> 00:20:51.698
Defense systems are.
they're impenetrable.

253
00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:54.045
There's no possible way
anything could happen to him.

254
00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:55.737
Besides. he's with
Allie and Jesse.

255
00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:57.773
Those two are the top
of their class.

256
00:20:57.911 --> 00:21:00.120
Who only graduated last week.

257
00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.570
Cyrus. are you even
listening to me?

258
00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:03.538
What would you
have me do. Kelli?

259
00:21:03.676 --> 00:21:05.194
Send someone after them.

260
00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:09.095
You're the commander-in-chief.
Do something.

261
00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:10.683
I can't do anything!

262
00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:13.237
Not without the committee's
approval.

263
00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:14.583
So?

264
00:21:14.721 --> 00:21:17.724
What. we just do nothing?

265
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.869
What if the Exiles captured him?

266
00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:31.842
Honey.

267
00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:37.468
like humanity. we have no idea

268
00:21:37.606 --> 00:21:39.677
as to the whereabouts
of the Exiles.

269
00:21:39.815 --> 00:21:41.714
Now. that also means
that we have no reason

270
00:21:41.852 --> 00:21:43.647
to think that there's
an active threat.

271
00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:45.442
Cyrus. please.

272
00:21:48.168 --> 00:21:48.962
Please.

273
00:21:54.968 --> 00:21:56.315
I'll talk to the committee.

274
00:21:57.488 --> 00:21:58.282
Okay?

275
00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:02.976
Do you
really think he's okay?

276
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.186
I wouldn't
have sent our son halfway

277
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.741
across the galaxy if I
didn't think he was ready.

278
00:22:19.614 --> 00:22:21.926
Now you belong to my tribe.

279
00:22:31.073 --> 00:22:33.766
Yeah. all the bad spirits.

280
00:22:33.904 --> 00:22:35.319
gone. gone. gone.

281
00:22:36.285 --> 00:22:41.256
Chase them away!

282
00:22:43.948 --> 00:22:44.880
Wait!

283
00:22:45.018 --> 00:22:48.815
Stay!

284
00:22:49.713 --> 00:22:51.749
Lets play dirt.

285
00:22:52.267 --> 00:22:53.095
Yeah!

286
00:22:54.442 --> 00:22:57.548
Grow. grow. grow.

287
00:22:57.686 --> 00:22:58.894
And over there.

288
00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:03.002
And a little bit on yourself.

289
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.348
And share.

290
00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:05.349
Share. share.

291
00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.052
Grow. grow. grow.

292
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.226
Hey! Come back!

293
00:23:22.262 --> 00:23:23.816
Hey. guys! Wait up!

294
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.405
Wait for me.

295
00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:29.822
Oh! Oh!

296
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.788
I'm sorry.

297
00:23:37.174 --> 00:23:38.347
Zoey!

298
00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:39.970
Zoey. wait for me!

299
00:23:41.627 --> 00:23:44.077
Bam. For something
so primitive. it sure hauls
asteroid.

300
00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:45.493
I need you to behave.

301
00:23:45.631 --> 00:23:47.736
You're about to meet the leader
of the Resistance.

302
00:24:13.797 --> 00:24:17.145
General. Nice to
finally meet you.

303
00:24:17.283 --> 00:24:18.111
Hey!

304
00:24:19.665 --> 00:24:21.494
Who have you dragged
in this time. Zoey?

305
00:24:21.632 --> 00:24:23.185
General! General!

306
00:24:23.323 --> 00:24:27.776
You won't believe the fireball
this guy came riding in on.

307
00:24:27.914 --> 00:24:31.608
He must've been going mach 30
when he crashed into the city.

308
00:24:31.746 --> 00:24:35.301
We found him chilling half
dead against his ship.

309
00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:37.199
and Zoey's all like. "Oh.
we gotta go check him out."

310
00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:40.720
But I was like. "Nah. you
should proceed with caution."

311
00:24:40.858 --> 00:24:42.273
You know?
Thomas.

312
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:46.243
But then this drone came and
started shooting nukes at us.

313
00:24:46.381 --> 00:24:47.520
- Thomas!
- But did I say

314
00:24:47.658 --> 00:24:49.039
you came from the sky?

315
00:24:49.177 --> 00:24:51.697
I knew they'd come
back. I knew it.

316
00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:53.802
I'm sure your story holds
truth. on the truth. Thomas.

317
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.734
Who?

318
00:24:54.872 --> 00:24:56.356
Who exactly is

319
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:57.599
"they?"

320
00:24:57.737 --> 00:24:58.566
Don't say
it. Don't say it.

321
00:24:59.567 --> 00:25:01.085
Colonials. Hello.

322
00:25:02.052 --> 00:25:03.502
Colonials?

323
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.815
Seems as though that crash
has jogged his memory. General.

324
00:25:06.953 --> 00:25:10.336
You don't need that mask
in here. Zoey. Take it off.

325
00:25:10.474 --> 00:25:13.063
Now. I'm glad you all
made it back here safely.

326
00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:16.031
but now we need to get to
the bottom of this situation.

327
00:25:17.688 --> 00:25:20.242
That Exile drone
came in very quickly.

328
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.349
They must've wanted to recover
whatever crashed there.

329
00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:26.317
You. Hey. I'm talking to you.

330
00:25:26.455 --> 00:25:27.560
General.

331
00:25:27.698 --> 00:25:29.251
What happened
before the crash?

332
00:25:30.356 --> 00:25:31.668
Honestly. I. uh.

333
00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:36.396
I couldn't tell you.

334
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:37.881
He couldn't even
tell me his own name.

335
00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:39.676
if it hadn't been
for that dog tag.

336
00:25:39.814 --> 00:25:42.023
He's a Colonial. It's obvious.

337
00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:43.749
So what is your name?

338
00:25:44.612 --> 00:25:45.474
Uh...

339
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.408
Silas.

340
00:25:49.824 --> 00:25:52.792
Did we recover any
intel from his ship. Zoey?

341
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.140
No. unfortunately not.
We didn't have enough time.

342
00:25:56.278 --> 00:25:59.316
The only thing we
recovered was Silas.

343
00:25:59.454 --> 00:26:02.284
Ma'am. I received news
on the crashed vessel.

344
00:26:05.805 --> 00:26:07.289
All right. listen up.

345
00:26:08.497 --> 00:26:09.809
Resistance scouts are reporting

346
00:26:09.947 --> 00:26:12.087
that your ship was
taken to this quadrant.

347
00:26:13.744 --> 00:26:15.435
Now. we don't know
what they want.

348
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.924
Zoey. Thomas. I want you to
infiltrate the Exile base

349
00:26:21.062 --> 00:26:22.408
and recover that ship.

350
00:26:22.546 --> 00:26:24.237
And this must be
done under the radar.

351
00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:27.309
That means leaving that
noisy vehicle if yours behind

352
00:26:27.447 --> 00:26:29.070
and going in on foot.

353
00:26:29.208 --> 00:26:30.554
But we can't.

354
00:26:30.692 --> 00:26:34.869
But even if we get past
the guards and reach the ship.

355
00:26:35.007 --> 00:26:36.871
how do we fly back?

356
00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:39.598
That's precisely why
I'm having you take Silas.

357
00:26:39.736 --> 00:26:42.670
Hopefully. being near that
ship will jog his memory.

358
00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:45.949
Hopefully? Good.
good.

359
00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:47.329
You want us to risk our lives

360
00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:49.366
for this random guy we just met?

361
00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:50.678
Zoey.

362
00:26:50.816 --> 00:26:53.370
every day we don't act.

363
00:26:53.508 --> 00:26:57.167
more humans are forced
into slavery. or worse.

364
00:26:57.305 --> 00:26:59.963
The ship could be the key
to everything.

365
00:27:01.965 --> 00:27:02.759
I understand.

366
00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:05.969
Let's go. Thomas.

367
00:27:07.729 --> 00:27:10.870
Yeah. just breeze
past the Exile guards

368
00:27:11.008 --> 00:27:13.148
and reach the ship that
nobody knows how to fly

369
00:27:13.286 --> 00:27:16.082
but the mindless alien that
doesn't even know his own name.

370
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.049
Yeah. sure.

371
00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:23.193
Go. go. go. go. Go. go.

372
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:24.781
Go. go. go. go.
go. go. go. go. go.

373
00:27:34.722 --> 00:27:36.585
There's someone I know
who may be able

374
00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:38.760
to help figure out
where you came from.

375
00:27:38.898 --> 00:27:42.212
However. we haven't had contact
with him for some time now.

376
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.041
I'll try anything
at this point.

377
00:27:45.767 --> 00:27:46.975
His name is Zeke.

378
00:27:47.113 --> 00:27:48.770
He used to play a major
role in the Resistance.

379
00:27:48.908 --> 00:27:50.910
but he dropped out of society.

380
00:27:51.048 --> 00:27:53.913
and he's taken steps
to keep it that way.

381
00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:55.639
Where can I find this Zeke?

382
00:27:56.985 --> 00:27:58.884
The last known location
of his residence.

383
00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:02.059
The man is very
dangerous. Silas.

384
00:28:02.197 --> 00:28:03.854
Who's to save if he
even still thinks

385
00:28:03.992 --> 00:28:05.442
of the Resistance as an ally?

386
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:08.687
Thank you. General.

387
00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:11.310
What about Thomas and Zoey?

388
00:28:12.829 --> 00:28:15.348
Think of this as a reward
for completing your task.

389
00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:19.801
Once you've covered your ship.
feel free to seek him out.

390
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:38.889
You. come here.

391
00:28:39.027 --> 00:28:40.649
Yes. you.

392
00:28:40.788 --> 00:28:42.721
Come here. quick!

393
00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:43.687
Come here!

394
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.540
Raven. what
have you uncovered?

395
00:30:18.678 --> 00:30:21.854
The technology is of
Colonial design. as I presumed.

396
00:30:21.992 --> 00:30:23.511
Yes.

397
00:30:23.649 --> 00:30:24.892
Excellent.

398
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.445
What else?

399
00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:27.895
According to the bot's
data log.

400
00:30:28.033 --> 00:30:31.968
the ship belongs to a
Colonial named Silas.

401
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.181
That's not
just any Colonial.

402
00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:40.942
That's Silas. son of Cyrus.

403
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.048
commander of the Colonial
forces.

404
00:30:43.186 --> 00:30:45.050
Yes. What would
you have me do?

405
00:30:45.188 --> 00:30:48.536
Go to Section
45 and await my commands.

406
00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:52.643
I'm sending Lockjaw and
Flatline to help assist.

407
00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:54.645
- And the droid?
- Leave it.

408
00:30:54.783 --> 00:30:57.062
You have what you
need already. Now go.

409
00:30:58.339 --> 00:30:59.788
As you command.

410
00:30:59.927 --> 00:31:03.585
And bring me
that Colonial.

411
00:31:52.186 --> 00:31:53.773
So what's up with Zoey?

412
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:54.809
What do you mean?

413
00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:57.122
Like. from the start.

414
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.365
she's treated me
like a pile of dirt.

415
00:31:59.503 --> 00:32:02.713
I mean. it's not
you necessarily.

416
00:32:02.851 --> 00:32:06.545
It's kind of just how we were
raised with the Resistance.

417
00:32:06.683 --> 00:32:08.064
So what about you?

418
00:32:08.202 --> 00:32:10.721
I mean. like.
why did she tolerate you?

419
00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:12.413
Are you two like...

420
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:14.622
No. No!

421
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.141
It's not like that.

422
00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:18.937
We're basically brother
and sister at this point.

423
00:32:19.075 --> 00:32:20.145
Could've fooled me. I mean.

424
00:32:20.283 --> 00:32:22.147
your personalities
are vastly different.

425
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.564
I'd ask you a
question. but. uh...

426
00:32:29.154 --> 00:32:31.121
I hope it comes
back to me eventually.

427
00:32:33.365 --> 00:32:35.539
Aren't you a little young to
be venturing off on your own?

428
00:32:35.677 --> 00:32:38.266
I mean. where are your parents?

429
00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:43.064
Well. we both kind of think
of Rhea as our parent figure.

430
00:32:44.686 --> 00:32:47.931
Zoey and I. our parents
both were sold into slavery

431
00:32:48.069 --> 00:32:50.830
by the Exiles when
we were really young.

432
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.696
I don't know where they are or
if they're even still alive.

433
00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:59.908
Like. I don't even know
who my parents are.

434
00:33:00.047 --> 00:33:02.014
if that makes you
feel any better.

435
00:33:02.152 --> 00:33:04.051
It is what it is.

436
00:33:04.189 --> 00:33:05.569
Even then. I-

437
00:33:05.707 --> 00:33:08.158
Hey. what are you two
wingnuts blabbering about?

438
00:33:08.296 --> 00:33:09.780
Uh. nothing.

439
00:33:11.127 --> 00:33:12.818
Actually. Thomas
was just telling me

440
00:33:12.956 --> 00:33:14.820
about your embarrassing
ex-boyfriends.

441
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:17.754
Oh. is that so?

442
00:33:18.893 --> 00:33:20.205
I'll tell you
what's embarrassing.

443
00:33:20.343 --> 00:33:22.862
Watching you trying to
shoot down that Exile drone.

444
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.658
Well. uh. you know.
Silas was telling me

445
00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:28.282
how he much preferred
you without your mask on.

446
00:33:29.283 --> 00:33:30.422
Oh.

447
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.940
No.

448
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:34.115
No. I mean. you
removed your mask.

449
00:33:34.253 --> 00:33:36.255
and you had. like.
she had dirt. okay?

450
00:33:36.393 --> 00:33:38.154
You had a lot of dirt
all over your face.

451
00:33:38.292 --> 00:33:40.328
and I was like. you know?
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

452
00:33:40.466 --> 00:33:43.331
Are you sure you weren't worried
about the dirt on my face?

453
00:33:43.469 --> 00:33:44.953
Speaking of dirt. um.

454
00:33:45.092 --> 00:33:48.233
did you guys see the crazy.
guy. like playing in the dirt?

455
00:33:48.371 --> 00:33:50.442
Yeah. that guy got me
with his voodoo games. too.

456
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.686
Yeah. I couldn't move. Like.
he kept me there for hours.

457
00:33:53.824 --> 00:33:55.171
Jokes aside now. guys.

458
00:33:56.724 --> 00:34:00.900
This mission is extremely
crucial to the Resistance.

459
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.419
Now. if it were up to me.

460
00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:03.662
I'd be in and out of that
base before you could blink.

461
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.595
but I don't know how
to fly that ship.

462
00:34:05.733 --> 00:34:07.976
Yeah? Well. what makes
you think I know how?

463
00:34:09.668 --> 00:34:12.222
Hey. don't ask
me. That's on Rhea.

464
00:34:13.361 --> 00:34:15.467
I mean. you're
obviously inexperienced.

465
00:34:15.605 --> 00:34:17.641
You don't even know
how to fire a weapon.

466
00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:22.336
You're just a nobody that's
gonna end up getting us killed.

467
00:34:22.474 --> 00:34:23.302
Come on. Zoe.

468
00:34:24.303 --> 00:34:26.685
No. No. this isn't a joke.

469
00:34:26.823 --> 00:34:28.411
The Exiles will kill us
the first chance they get.

470
00:34:28.549 --> 00:34:31.448
and we don't need this
anchor holding us down.

471
00:34:37.454 --> 00:34:38.283
I'm going to bed.

472
00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:43.771
Um. I'm sorry about that. man.

473
00:34:45.428 --> 00:34:47.602
But hey. you know.
maybe she's right.

474
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:51.330
We've got a busy day tomorrow.
Let's get some rest. yeah?

475
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.534
Silas!

476
00:35:24.018 --> 00:35:24.881
No!

477
00:36:24.906 --> 00:36:25.700
He's gone.

478
00:36:26.598 --> 00:36:28.324
We can't find Silas anywhere.

479
00:36:28.462 --> 00:36:30.533
He must have left last night.
What are we gonna do now?

480
00:36:30.671 --> 00:36:31.292
Let him go.

481
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.431
Let him go?

482
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:33.812
He's a freaking pilot.

483
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.054
Colonials wouldn't
have changed

484
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.815
their ship controls
too drastically.

485
00:36:36.953 --> 00:36:41.164
And if anyone can figure out
to fly their ship. it's you.

486
00:36:41.302 --> 00:36:42.717
She's right.

487
00:36:42.855 --> 00:36:44.685
Weren't you just complaining
about how he was a risk anyway?

488
00:36:44.823 --> 00:36:47.515
Hey. we're out of
options and time.

489
00:36:47.653 --> 00:36:50.104
I need you both to
get moving. now. Go.

490
00:37:24.276 --> 00:37:25.933
No communication
has been received

491
00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:28.211
from the Delta One in days.

492
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:31.145
We need to send another
ship immediately

493
00:37:31.283 --> 00:37:32.767
and investigate what happened.

494
00:37:32.905 --> 00:37:34.044
Oh. that's outrageous!

495
00:37:34.182 --> 00:37:35.183
You
already convinced us

496
00:37:35.322 --> 00:37:37.151
to send one ship on
this goose chase.

497
00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:38.635
but why would we send another?

498
00:37:38.773 --> 00:37:40.119
Not to
mention. we don't even know

499
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:43.433
if there's anything wrong with
Delta Squad to begin with.

500
00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:45.401
They're
no more than greedy viruses

501
00:37:45.539 --> 00:37:47.403
consuming everything
in their path.

502
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:49.577
Turning our back
on those less fortunate?

503
00:37:49.715 --> 00:37:51.924
Have you forgotten
from where you came?

504
00:37:52.062 --> 00:37:54.686
The Earthlings are
committed to the Exiles now.

505
00:37:54.824 --> 00:37:55.963
Breaking communication with us

506
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:57.965
just confirms where
their loyalty lies.

507
00:37:59.207 --> 00:38:01.624
And let them revert
back to the dark ages?

508
00:38:01.762 --> 00:38:04.972
There are humans
that need our help.

509
00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.976
We cannot afford to put any
more Colonial lives in danger.

510
00:38:09.114 --> 00:38:10.391
I will not put
up with this any longer!

511
00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:11.944
Order!

512
00:38:12.082 --> 00:38:14.257
Order. I say! Order!

513
00:38:15.085 --> 00:38:16.432
Yes.

514
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.123
it is true

515
00:38:18.261 --> 00:38:20.781
that we funded this mission

516
00:38:20.919 --> 00:38:23.680
and gave it our
precious resources.

517
00:38:23.818 --> 00:38:26.062
But I want all of this
committee to remember

518
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.030
that the mission was voluntary.

519
00:38:30.342 --> 00:38:32.137
and one of the brave soldiers

520
00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:35.554
who volunteered so valiantly

521
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:38.316
was Cyrus's own son.

522
00:38:39.834 --> 00:38:43.459
Now. I do not assume that
any member of this senate

523
00:38:43.597 --> 00:38:46.324
is going to jump
at the opportunity

524
00:38:46.462 --> 00:38:50.155
to send one of your own family
members into this situation.

525
00:38:50.293 --> 00:38:53.503
So I say we listen to Cyrus.

526
00:38:53.641 --> 00:38:56.989
because Cyrus has given
more to this mission

527
00:38:57.127 --> 00:38:58.922
than any of you.

528
00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.096
and he must be heard.

529
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:08.691
All right. we understand
what needs to be discussed.

530
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:12.626
Cyrus. we'll congregate.
We'll discuss the matter.

531
00:39:12.764 --> 00:39:15.974
Tomorrow we'll have
an answer. Until then.

532
00:41:11.503 --> 00:41:12.331
Hey!

533
00:41:18.752 --> 00:41:19.511
Hey!

534
00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:30.833
Hey. you there!

535
00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:36.424
Hey!

536
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:12.909
Hey!

537
00:42:17.086 --> 00:42:17.914
Hey!

538
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.484
Sorry!

539
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.418
I'm sorry!

540
00:42:40.868 --> 00:42:41.628
No! No!

541
00:42:41.766 --> 00:42:42.560
No! No!

542
00:42:48.117 --> 00:42:49.567
Where do you come from. boy?

543
00:42:49.705 --> 00:42:50.498
Uh.

544
00:42:52.673 --> 00:42:53.467
the sky.

545
00:42:54.606 --> 00:42:55.400
I think.

546
00:42:59.404 --> 00:43:00.854
You know how to play charades?

547
00:43:10.449 --> 00:43:12.244
I lost my hearing
in the old war.

548
00:43:13.314 --> 00:43:15.040
Well. most of it. anyway.

549
00:43:15.178 --> 00:43:18.975
It wasn't so bad when I had my
late wife Elizabeth with me.

550
00:43:19.113 --> 00:43:20.459
I'll tell
you. I'll tell you.

551
00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:22.772
that woman. she could talk
an elephant's ear off.

552
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:23.980
Like a record player.

553
00:43:24.118 --> 00:43:27.708
just going around and
around and around.

554
00:43:28.882 --> 00:43:30.469
I miss her.

555
00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:32.748
I pictured you
being more of a-

556
00:43:32.886 --> 00:43:34.197
You know. now it's
just me and Morgan.

557
00:43:34.335 --> 00:43:35.785
and he don't say much.

558
00:43:37.304 --> 00:43:38.132
Wait.

559
00:43:39.168 --> 00:43:40.203
Morgan?
I can't hear you.

560
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:41.066
Morgan?

561
00:43:41.204 --> 00:43:42.585
I can't hear you.

562
00:43:42.723 --> 00:43:44.138
and I don't go in for that
sign language crap. either.

563
00:43:44.276 --> 00:43:47.659
Not with these sausages. Come
on. look at 'em.

564
00:43:47.797 --> 00:43:48.764
- Wow!
- Hey!

565
00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:50.869
You see something
that looks like

566
00:43:51.007 --> 00:43:52.733
it doesn't come from this world.

567
00:43:52.871 --> 00:43:55.494
do yourself a favor and
don't touch it. got it?

568
00:43:58.359 --> 00:44:00.396
I lost my arm during the war

569
00:44:00.534 --> 00:44:03.295
protecting the humans
against those Exiles.

570
00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:04.987
- Exiles?
- I'll never forget the witch

571
00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.954
who took my arm. cut it off.

572
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.509
Well. get your pen and
paper. Let's get to it.

573
00:44:11.994 --> 00:44:13.133
Uh...

574
00:44:13.271 --> 00:44:14.375
Oh.

575
00:44:14.513 --> 00:44:15.342
Okay.

576
00:44:20.727 --> 00:44:21.589
So your

577
00:44:22.729 --> 00:44:23.591
hand?

578
00:44:25.145 --> 00:44:26.318
It got taken.

579
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.149
Yeah.

580
00:44:30.184 --> 00:44:31.013
Uh...

581
00:44:32.428 --> 00:44:33.222
Who

582
00:44:34.188 --> 00:44:35.500
took it?

583
00:44:35.638 --> 00:44:36.984
I know you can't
remember anything.

584
00:44:37.122 --> 00:44:39.124
but are you sure
you're not a professor?

585
00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:40.470
Professor?

586
00:44:40.608 --> 00:44:42.990
Yeah. 'cause you got a
PhD in busted my balls.

587
00:44:45.096 --> 00:44:48.340
She was an assassin. Did
all Grom's dirty work.

588
00:44:50.584 --> 00:44:52.275
- Grom?
- Don't you know anything?

589
00:44:52.413 --> 00:44:54.381
The Exiles. Silas.

590
00:44:54.519 --> 00:44:56.383
The Exiles. they
are led by Grom.

591
00:44:56.521 --> 00:44:58.730
He is a very
dangerous individual.

592
00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:02.216
He used to also be a
very powerful Colonial.

593
00:45:03.321 --> 00:45:04.702
and he used to be my friend.

594
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.533
Look. Silas. there was
a time when humans.

595
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:12.330
they thrived during
the Space Age.

596
00:45:12.468 --> 00:45:14.781
and the best of the best.
the elite.

597
00:45:14.919 --> 00:45:16.644
they became known
as the Colonials.

598
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.786
But they couldn't.

599
00:45:19.924 --> 00:45:21.097
they couldn't handle
the technology. some of them.

600
00:45:21.235 --> 00:45:23.790
and. well. they got
engulfed in greed.

601
00:45:24.963 --> 00:45:27.379
eventually they were
cast out of the colony.

602
00:45:27.517 --> 00:45:30.279
They were banished like
Lucifer from Heaven.

603
00:45:30.417 --> 00:45:32.177
And they became
known as the Exiles.

604
00:45:36.009 --> 00:45:39.357
What happened to the. um.

605
00:45:39.495 --> 00:45:40.289
Exiles?

606
00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.429
With nowhere else to go.

607
00:45:42.567 --> 00:45:44.120
they made the long
voyage back to Earth.

608
00:45:46.157 --> 00:45:48.642
And when they got there.
they took their new power

609
00:45:49.608 --> 00:45:51.403
and they waged war on mankind.

610
00:45:52.922 --> 00:45:54.130
It was decided by the Colonials

611
00:45:54.268 --> 00:45:55.960
that we would send
a small force.

612
00:45:57.133 --> 00:45:58.894
myself included. were
sent to intervene.

613
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.588
When we got there. we were
pushed back almost immediately.

614
00:46:03.726 --> 00:46:07.281
No choices. no options.
I was left behind.

615
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:11.320
So now you know why I'm
here. But why are you here?

616
00:46:13.598 --> 00:46:14.841
Well. I. um.

617
00:46:17.188 --> 00:46:18.361
I was. uh.

618
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.019
here by Rhea.

619
00:46:23.021 --> 00:46:24.851
Rhea.

620
00:46:24.989 --> 00:46:27.025
Yeah. there's a name
I haven't thought about

621
00:46:27.163 --> 00:46:28.371
in a very long time.

622
00:46:28.509 --> 00:46:29.683
- Yeah?
- She's a special one.

623
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:31.202
ain't she?

624
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.790
But why did she send you here?

625
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.240
Well. I. um.

626
00:46:35.378 --> 00:46:37.518
I crash...

627
00:46:40.073 --> 00:46:41.799
I crash landed on Earth.

628
00:46:44.594 --> 00:46:47.390
What happened or who...

629
00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:54.052
Well. I'll tell you one thing.

630
00:46:55.502 --> 00:46:59.368
that dog tag you wearing.
that doesn't come from Earth.

631
00:46:59.506 --> 00:47:01.542
I'll tell you what.

632
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.960
you showed me yours
so I'll show you mine.

633
00:47:05.098 --> 00:47:08.308
Lookie-lookie. I got
one just like you.

634
00:47:08.446 --> 00:47:09.619
You serious?

635
00:47:09.757 --> 00:47:11.345
Yeah.

636
00:47:11.483 --> 00:47:15.315
So I'm a spaceman sitting
with another spaceman.

637
00:47:15.453 --> 00:47:18.214
just sipping tea in
the middle of. um...

638
00:47:19.733 --> 00:47:20.665
Uh...

639
00:47:21.562 --> 00:47:22.425
How long

640
00:47:23.323 --> 00:47:24.151
have you

641
00:47:25.014 --> 00:47:26.498
been here?

642
00:47:26.636 --> 00:47:28.086
Well. about 60 years.

643
00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:31.193
60 years?

644
00:47:32.677 --> 00:47:33.851
How did that happen?

645
00:47:35.611 --> 00:47:36.646
How old are you?

646
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.373
Ah.

647
00:47:39.511 --> 00:47:42.031
Well. come the next.

648
00:47:42.169 --> 00:47:45.241
come the next winter solstice.
I'll be 127 years old.

649
00:47:45.379 --> 00:47:48.313
I've still got some lead
left in my pencil. too.

650
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:53.284
You. me. Morgan.
we're all Colonials.

651
00:47:55.113 --> 00:47:55.907
Wait.

652
00:47:57.598 --> 00:47:58.945
We're Colonials?

653
00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:00.774
Mm-hmm.

654
00:48:05.572 --> 00:48:06.849
Where's. where's Morgan?

655
00:48:06.987 --> 00:48:07.712
Morgan. Morgan!

656
00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.024
- Morgan!
- You know what?

657
00:48:09.162 --> 00:48:10.232
I think you waited
long enough. too.

658
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.647
I think it's about
to have you meet him.

659
00:48:11.785 --> 00:48:14.719
Hey. Morgan! I got someone
I want you to meet!

660
00:48:14.857 --> 00:48:16.963
Ah. stay right there.
Stay right there.

661
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:19.620
Morgan. I'm coming!

662
00:48:19.758 --> 00:48:20.587
Morgan!

663
00:48:21.968 --> 00:48:22.830
Where are you?

664
00:48:24.625 --> 00:48:25.833
Silas?
Yeah?

665
00:48:25.972 --> 00:48:27.352
I want you to meet Morgan.

666
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.768
Yeah.

667
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:32.116
Morgan. this here is Silas.

668
00:48:33.565 --> 00:48:36.430
Yeah. Like I said.
he don't say much.

669
00:48:36.568 --> 00:48:38.639
What's the matter. Morgan?
Cat got your tongue?

670
00:48:38.777 --> 00:48:42.160
Yeah. He's a good boy.

671
00:48:42.298 --> 00:48:43.368
That's Silas.

672
00:48:54.621 --> 00:48:56.692
Oh. get down. Get down.

673
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.804
Yup. we're gonna die.

674
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.875
We've been in this
situation before.

675
00:49:08.014 --> 00:49:12.018
Okay. This place
is oozing with Exiles. Zoe.

676
00:49:12.156 --> 00:49:14.261
How do you even propose
we get to the ship?

677
00:49:40.494 --> 00:49:41.323
Rock.

678
00:49:41.461 --> 00:49:42.945
The rock. Rock.

679
00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:44.671
The rock. Come on.

680
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:46.293
Come on. Hurry up.

681
00:49:55.578 --> 00:49:57.270
Huh?

682
00:50:00.514 --> 00:50:01.308
Come on.

683
00:50:15.184 --> 00:50:15.978
Whoa!

684
00:50:17.152 --> 00:50:20.051
How did you
get here? Stop them.

685
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.438
All right. you draw
the ax above your head.

686
00:50:27.576 --> 00:50:30.786
you focus on your target.
nothing but the target.

687
00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:32.788
and then you strike
without thought.

688
00:50:38.518 --> 00:50:39.657
There you go!

689
00:50:39.795 --> 00:50:40.692
Ha-ha!

690
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.935
Yeah. just might have a chance

691
00:50:42.073 --> 00:50:43.488
of getting up this
planet after all.

692
00:50:46.008 --> 00:50:48.355
What's going on?

693
00:50:48.493 --> 00:50:50.771
- Uh...
- Well. go. It's a desert.

694
00:50:57.123 --> 00:50:58.710
I mean. go anywhere.

695
00:50:59.573 --> 00:51:00.298
I do.

696
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:15.210
Zeke!

697
00:51:37.991 --> 00:51:39.096
Raven!

698
00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:34.220
Morgan. how about a
little bit of help?

699
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:40.018
All right. fine.
I'll do it myself.

700
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:44.575
Kill him!

701
00:53:10.773 --> 00:53:12.430
What? Come on now.

702
00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:17.401
Zeke!

703
00:53:28.343 --> 00:53:29.792
Did you see that. Morgan?

704
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.932
Yeah. just like we practiced.

705
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:37.377
Huh? Hm

706
00:54:54.981 --> 00:54:56.983
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

707
00:54:57.121 --> 00:54:58.709
Did you see what's going on
out there? They have an army.

708
00:54:58.847 --> 00:55:00.780
They have fighter
ships. They have robots.

709
00:55:00.918 --> 00:55:02.437
Shh! Be quiet!

710
00:55:02.575 --> 00:55:05.612
Shh!

711
00:55:10.237 --> 00:55:11.894
- Just-
- Behind you! Behind you!

712
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.285
Let's go.

713
00:55:34.296 --> 00:55:38.127
Zoey. we need to
get out of Mordor now.

714
00:55:38.265 --> 00:55:43.270
I'm working on it. man. My
adrenaline is off the charts.

715
00:55:45.169 --> 00:55:47.378
Hey. hey. isn't it
the robot from earlier?

716
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:52.797
Let's follow him. Come on.

717
00:56:02.048 --> 00:56:03.877
Are you serious?

718
00:56:04.015 --> 00:56:05.914
What is going on with
that wonder ball?

719
00:56:15.095 --> 00:56:17.546
Look. He's stealing that ship.

720
00:56:36.841 --> 00:56:41.812
Hey. look. That
door is still open.

721
00:56:42.571 --> 00:56:42.951
Come on. let's go.

722
00:57:09.736 --> 00:57:13.119
Sure
would like to see R2-D2

723
00:57:13.257 --> 00:57:15.017
pull something off like that.

724
00:57:16.502 --> 00:57:20.575
Uh. something doesn't
seem right with my circuits.

725
00:57:20.713 --> 00:57:24.406
Feels like someone
or something's tampered
with my body.

726
00:57:26.581 --> 00:57:30.757
Did you see that? He just
murdered half an army. murdered!

727
00:57:30.895 --> 00:57:33.622
Why would we get on this
ship with this maniac robot?

728
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.245
Thomas. look at me. okay?
I need you to calm down.

729
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.353
He doesn't even have arms.
How is he flying the ship?

730
00:57:40.491 --> 00:57:42.148
He's obviously
not with the Exiles.

731
00:57:42.286 --> 00:57:44.495
since he just massacred them.

732
00:57:44.633 --> 00:57:47.912
Yeah. but what's stopping
him from massacring us?

733
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:50.225
We can't stay here forever.

734
00:57:50.363 --> 00:57:51.882
We need to go talk to him.

735
00:57:52.952 --> 00:57:54.229
Huh-uh-nu-nu-nu-no

736
00:57:54.367 --> 00:57:55.057
Shh!

737
00:57:55.195 --> 00:57:57.094
We need to do something.

738
00:57:58.267 --> 00:58:00.269
No. I do not
wanna go over there.

739
00:58:02.513 --> 00:58:04.342
The option is
to go talk to him.

740
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:06.275
unless you wanna
jump off the ship.

741
00:58:08.761 --> 00:58:10.141
Okay. Fine.

742
00:58:10.279 --> 00:58:13.662
Huh. I wonder what
happened to that doofus Silas?

743
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.423
I swear. if he's
gotten himself killed.

744
00:58:16.562 --> 00:58:20.013
Cyrus will have me formatted.

745
00:58:21.394 --> 00:58:22.429
Who's there?

746
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:27.124
Eh. probably another space rat.

747
00:58:29.436 --> 00:58:31.715
Did you see that?

748
00:58:31.853 --> 00:58:35.063
I can't do this. Zoe.
That is a devil bot.

749
00:58:36.167 --> 00:58:36.996
Let's go.

750
00:58:39.377 --> 00:58:40.171
Hey. robot.

751
00:58:43.761 --> 00:58:45.211
How did
you kids get in here?

752
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:46.764
Zoey. It was her fault.

753
00:58:46.902 --> 00:58:50.630
We saw you take out that
Exile army. and your ship.

754
00:58:50.768 --> 00:58:53.806
it was our only chance of
escape. so we hopped on.

755
00:58:53.944 --> 00:58:55.601
We're sorry. We're sorry.

756
00:58:55.739 --> 00:58:58.776
I don't even know how
or why I was at that base.

757
00:58:58.914 --> 00:59:01.261
but I'd never forget
what an Exile looks like.

758
00:59:01.399 --> 00:59:04.264
We saw you in a
room. taken apart.

759
00:59:05.783 --> 00:59:08.268
Could explain why I have no
recollection after the crash.

760
00:59:08.406 --> 00:59:09.442
You

761
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.685
were on

762
00:59:10.823 --> 00:59:12.756
this ship when it crashed?

763
00:59:12.894 --> 00:59:15.759
I was designed by
Colonial engineers on Mars

764
00:59:15.897 --> 00:59:18.313
to serve with
the Delta One Regiment.

765
00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:20.073
I knew it!

766
00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:21.592
I told you

767
00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.042
that Silas

768
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:23.974
is a

769
00:59:24.112 --> 00:59:25.769
Colonial.

770
00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:27.840
Yes. Silas.

771
00:59:27.978 --> 00:59:29.945
Do you know where he is?

772
00:59:32.534 --> 00:59:34.916
I think there's someone
you need to meet.

773
00:59:45.892 --> 00:59:48.101
Cyrus. can I talk to you?

774
00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.622
Now look. I know this must be
a very difficult time for you.

775
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.934
but I just want you to know.

776
00:59:53.072 --> 00:59:55.522
I'm gonna do everything
in my power in there

777
00:59:55.661 --> 00:59:57.317
to find out what
happened to that mission.

778
00:59:57.455 --> 00:59:59.941
Thank you. Tobias.
I appreciate that.

779
01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.599
Now look. I know
you were a soldier.

780
01:00:02.737 --> 01:00:05.705
and I know. whatever
the outcome. you're
gonna be all right.

781
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.709
How's Kelli doing? I'm
sure this is hard on her.

782
01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:14.058
She's. um. she's strong.

783
01:00:15.542 --> 01:00:17.096
I think she blames me for this.

784
01:00:18.373 --> 01:00:21.307
Well. frankly. I don't
fault her for doing so.

785
01:00:21.445 --> 01:00:25.725
Cyrus. we all saw
the validity in the mission.

786
01:00:25.863 --> 01:00:27.209
You cannot blame yourself.

787
01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:30.212
I'll stop blaming myself
when we get them home safely.

788
01:00:33.837 --> 01:00:35.735
What do you think is
gonna happen in there?

789
01:00:41.258 --> 01:00:42.431
I don't know.

790
01:00:42.569 --> 01:00:43.778
I'll tell you. in the time

791
01:00:43.916 --> 01:00:45.400
that I've spent with
these pontificators.

792
01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:49.335
sometimes. just by accident.
they do the right thing.

793
01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:53.891
Now. I understand that
they all see the validity

794
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:56.238
in the coexistence
with the humans.

795
01:00:56.376 --> 01:00:59.000
and I don't think any one of
them would stand in the way

796
01:00:59.138 --> 01:01:01.347
of you finding out what
happened to your son.

797
01:01:01.485 --> 01:01:02.866
but I just don't know.

798
01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:06.145
Well. one way to find out.

799
01:01:07.284 --> 01:01:09.044
Okay.

800
01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:25.647
On behalf of all
the representatives
of this committee.

801
01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:28.685
we've decided not to
aid the Delta One crew.

802
01:01:28.823 --> 01:01:30.617
nor the humans still
living on Earth.

803
01:01:32.274 --> 01:01:33.828
The risk is too great to send

804
01:01:33.966 --> 01:01:35.968
any more Colonials
into the unknown.

805
01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:44.839
They said no.

806
01:01:44.977 --> 01:01:47.048
- What?
- They said no.

807
01:01:47.186 --> 01:01:48.774
They denied the request.

808
01:01:48.912 --> 01:01:50.085
What would the Exiles
do to him

809
01:01:50.223 --> 01:01:52.605
when they get
their hands on him.

810
01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.642
What will they do to him?

811
01:01:58.059 --> 01:01:59.232
Cyrus. Kelli. I'm
sorry to interrupt.

812
01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.476
Cyrus. you need to
come with me right now.

813
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.880
Tell Rhea exactly what you
told us on the ship. bot.

814
01:02:26.018 --> 01:02:28.848
Shall we do this
the proper way? My name's Spark.

815
01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:30.332
I was built by the Colonials

816
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:32.196
for the purpose of serving Silas

817
01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:35.303
and assisting the Delta One
Regiment on this mission.

818
01:02:35.441 --> 01:02:38.616
What exactly is.
or was. your mission?

819
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.343
The Colonials haven't
received any communications

820
01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:43.656
from the humans on
Earth for 50 years.

821
01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:45.416
Well. we could say
the same about you.

822
01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:46.624
Yeah. you're the ones
who cut off

823
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.488
all communications with us.

824
01:02:48.626 --> 01:02:50.249
Our mission
was to investigate

825
01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:53.424
what was causing
the interference and
report back to Cyrus.

826
01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:54.909
Who is Cyrus.

827
01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:56.911
Well. you already
met Silas. apparently.

828
01:02:57.981 --> 01:02:59.948
Cyrus is his father.

829
01:03:00.086 --> 01:03:02.537
and also the leader of
the Colonial colony.

830
01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.850
Have you sent back
any distress signals?

831
01:03:04.988 --> 01:03:06.230
I've
made many attempts.

832
01:03:06.368 --> 01:03:08.232
but haven't received a response.

833
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:24.870
I think I know what may
have happened to Silas.

834
01:03:26.526 --> 01:03:30.392
This weapon belonged to an
assassin known as Raven.

835
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:33.879
I believe she has something
to do with his disappearance.

836
01:03:34.017 --> 01:03:37.365
So we can assume
that Silas is dead?

837
01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:39.298
My fear is that the Exiles

838
01:03:39.436 --> 01:03:41.196
had figured out
exactly who Silas is.

839
01:03:42.439 --> 01:03:43.405
They've taken him
to a space station

840
01:03:43.543 --> 01:03:45.511
between Earth and the Moon.

841
01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:46.823
Why would they take him there?

842
01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:48.514
Because the space
station has always been

843
01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:51.206
out of our reach. until now.

844
01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:06.877
I told you. I don't know
anything about Colonials.

845
01:04:07.015 --> 01:04:08.534
Where are you taking me?

846
01:04:13.401 --> 01:04:15.196
Remove your clothes.

847
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.508
No.

848
01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:24.343
No!

849
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:05.142
I figured a
Colonial would be much

850
01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:07.558
larger.

851
01:05:11.424 --> 01:05:14.911
But here you are. no bigger
than the average human.

852
01:05:24.368 --> 01:05:27.026
I know everything about you
thanks to your little droid.

853
01:05:29.615 --> 01:05:32.169
You're gonna wish you never
came to Earth. Colonial.

854
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:51.257
Did you really
think you could come to Earth

855
01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:52.500
without us knowing?

856
01:05:53.811 --> 01:05:56.331
The stars shine upon
the Exiles today.

857
01:05:56.469 --> 01:05:58.540
The son of the great
Colonial leader

858
01:05:58.678 --> 01:06:00.404
is now in our possession.

859
01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:02.889
A Colonial present
in this very station

860
01:06:03.028 --> 01:06:04.753
that powers our barrier.

861
01:06:04.891 --> 01:06:07.170
Nothing gets through our
electromagnetic barrier.

862
01:06:07.308 --> 01:06:12.209
and nothing gets out. as you
shall soon learn.

863
01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.387
You will suffer every
second of every day

864
01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:20.355
until your people give us
back what they've stolen.

865
01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:22.806
Silas.

866
01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:26.983
you hold the very thing I've
desired since the beginning.

867
01:06:27.121 --> 01:06:31.988
knowledge. knowledge that only
the Red Planet can produce.

868
01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:36.406
Colonials are bigger. stronger.

869
01:06:36.544 --> 01:06:37.924
ageless.

870
01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:40.720
That planet fuels
your evolution.

871
01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:46.761
Your mind is the gateway
to the revolution.

872
01:06:46.899 --> 01:06:50.868
However. we need to get back
those precious memories.

873
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:55.218
and this tank will do
exactly that.

874
01:06:58.704 --> 01:07:02.397
Once I finish off what
remains of the Resistance

875
01:07:02.535 --> 01:07:05.090
and take complete
control of Earth.

876
01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:08.231
I'll begin preparations
for the Mars campaign.

877
01:07:08.369 --> 01:07:11.751
The Colonials will be
at my mercy.

878
01:07:40.159 --> 01:07:42.679
Another mission with little
hope of coming out alive.

879
01:07:42.817 --> 01:07:46.269
I swear. Rhea doesn't
care what happens to us.

880
01:07:46.407 --> 01:07:47.753
Don't worry.

881
01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:50.238
I picked up a handful of rocks
just in case we need 'em.

882
01:07:50.376 --> 01:07:51.929
Wait. rocks? What?

883
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.690
You don't wanna know.
Trust me.

884
01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:07.669
I wonder if Silas
would but be happy to see me?

885
01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:09.015
No way to know.

886
01:08:09.154 --> 01:08:10.258
The last time we saw him.

887
01:08:10.396 --> 01:08:12.467
he couldn't even
remember his own name.

888
01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:15.608
Apparently that crash
removed his memories.

889
01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:19.060
Great. Maybe now
he'll start listening to me.

890
01:08:19.198 --> 01:08:20.510
Zoey! Thomas!

891
01:08:20.648 --> 01:08:23.996
There's a large Exile
force approaching rapidly.

892
01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:26.032
We don't have the numbers
to counter their attack.

893
01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:29.415
Finish this as fast as
possible. We're outta time.

894
01:08:57.547 --> 01:08:59.065
You are
to return to Earth

895
01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:02.345
and rendezvous with
the rest of our forces.

896
01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:07.212
March for the Resistance base
at dawn. Eliminate them all.

897
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.799
And Silas?

898
01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:12.148
Let the chamber do
its work. He cannot escape.

899
01:09:13.079 --> 01:09:13.942
As you command.

900
01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:46.561
What are
you doing. Zoey?

901
01:09:46.699 --> 01:09:49.115
Silas is on that space station.

902
01:09:49.254 --> 01:09:50.116
Oops!

903
01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:56.192
There's more fighters
coming out of that station!

904
01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:01.714
We're all gonna die!

905
01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.654
Watch out!

906
01:11:30.907 --> 01:11:31.804
Shoot them!

907
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:46.060
Go! Go!

908
01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:46.888
Go. go. go. go. go!

909
01:11:47.026 --> 01:11:48.856
Shut up! I'm trying!

910
01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:52.998
If we keep this
up. we won't make it.

911
01:12:29.793 --> 01:12:32.900
This is
it! We're done for!

912
01:12:33.797 --> 01:12:34.626
Shut up!

913
01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:37.870
Guys? Hello?

914
01:12:40.459 --> 01:12:41.598
- Silas!
- Silas?

915
01:12:41.736 --> 01:12:43.531
You're alive!
I can't believe it!

916
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:45.291
I'm not getting formatted!

917
01:12:48.053 --> 01:12:49.606
Uh. guys?

918
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.783
We may not have much
time. We need to hurry.

919
01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.768
I don't we know where I'm going.

920
01:13:13.906 --> 01:13:15.218
I need an exit plan!

921
01:13:16.115 --> 01:13:18.221
Out of the way. human.

922
01:13:18.359 --> 01:13:20.361
I'll handle this nonsense.

923
01:13:22.846 --> 01:13:24.400
Think you can do better?

924
01:13:26.022 --> 01:13:27.299
I'll take
out these Exiles

925
01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.370
and swing around
and pick you up.

926
01:13:29.508 --> 01:13:30.406
Find an exit.

927
01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:32.200
Easy for you to say.

928
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.343
Ah!

929
01:14:20.283 --> 01:14:21.111
Whoa!

930
01:14:32.226 --> 01:14:32.916
Ah!

931
01:14:45.204 --> 01:14:46.274
Thomas. hit the button.

932
01:14:46.412 --> 01:14:47.586
What button?

933
01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:49.899
The one over there.

934
01:15:11.092 --> 01:15:12.093
Grab him! Hurry!

935
01:15:12.231 --> 01:15:13.232
I'm on it!

936
01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:27.833
You're alive!

937
01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:30.180
You son of a gun!

938
01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:32.320
No!

939
01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.529
I can't believe it!

940
01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:34.495
Yeah.

941
01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.912
Wow!

942
01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.604
Yeah. Get off me.

943
01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:41.675
Sorry. Sorry.

944
01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.403
Remember me?

945
01:15:47.612 --> 01:15:50.028
How could I forget a
floating alarm clock?

946
01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.133
I'll show
you something alarming.

947
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.618
Hey!

948
01:15:53.756 --> 01:15:57.000
Spark!

949
01:15:57.138 --> 01:15:59.175
How is that
for an alarm clock?

950
01:16:06.216 --> 01:16:10.151
Colonials. if
you're receiving this message.

951
01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:12.637
please take in
with great caution.

952
01:16:12.775 --> 01:16:15.536
The Exiles destroyed my
ship. and I'm sad to report

953
01:16:15.674 --> 01:16:18.574
that they took the lives of
both poor Allie and Jesse.

954
01:16:19.989 --> 01:16:24.165
Grom is alive. and now
more dangerous than ever.

955
01:16:24.303 --> 01:16:26.582
The Exiles planted
an electric barrier

956
01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.963
that blocked all
communication in and out.

957
01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:31.621
The Resistance are
extremely outmatched.

958
01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:32.691
Their lives.

959
01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:34.935
no. our lives.

960
01:16:35.073 --> 01:16:37.765
depend on the help
of the Colonials.

961
01:16:37.903 --> 01:16:42.045
So please. I urge you. send
help before it's too late.
