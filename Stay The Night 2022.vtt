3
00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:40.999
-Is now a good time?
-Um...

4
00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.309
I wanted to follow up
about the associate position.

5
00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:45.909
Right.

6
00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:47.104
Take a seat. Grace.

7
00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:54.611
I promise
I will not let you down.

8
00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.751
You didn't get it. Grace.

9
00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:00.393
Oh.

10
00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.389
Why?

11
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:03.992
It's a client-facing position.

12
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:05.760
Mentoring. recruiting.

13
00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.869
dealing with third-party
vendors who. let's face it.

14
00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:10.297
can sometimes be
a pain in the ass.

15
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.937
And that's why I applied.

16
00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:13.335
I'm ready for those challenges.

17
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:15.669
But you are more reserved.
Grace.

18
00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:18.143
and sometimes that reserve
comes across as.

19
00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:19.807
I don't know.
a little standoffish?

20
00:02:22.047 --> 00:02:24.013
I'm... standoffish?

21
00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:27.678
An HR associate
requires a particular skillset.

22
00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:30.214
someone outgoing. approachable.

23
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.790
For the client to open up. you
have to also open yourself up.

24
00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.456
I-I can do that.

25
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:36.658
I just need
the opportunity for it.

26
00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:40.968
Grace. you are a valuable
member of the HR team.

27
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.295
I've been here
for three years. Claire.

28
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.697
I work hard.

29
00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.303
Market analysis.
comps and benefits.

30
00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:47.802
I know it like
the back of my hand.

31
00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:51.078
I know you do. and there
is room for you to grow there.

32
00:02:51.113 --> 00:02:53.308
I...
I don't want to grow there.

33
00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:54.905
I want to do those other things.

34
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.716
You're not ready
for those other things.

35
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:58.015
I can be outgoing.

36
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.284
I can be approachable.

37
00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.685
Just give me the chance
and I'll show you!

38
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.587
Grace. we're not going
to hire you to make that change.

39
00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:09.626
You need to make
that change first.

40
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.762
Shit. I'm late for an off-site.

41
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.864
Let's keep talking. okay?

42
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:22.235
A new back-office position
opens up in six months.

43
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.371
Management.

44
00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.677
I think you'd be perfect for it.

45
00:03:25.712 --> 00:03:26.874
Okay?

46
00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:29.976
Okay.

47
00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:41.551
Oh. Grace!

48
00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:42.825
Oh. hey. Roshan.

49
00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:44.592
Hey.

50
00:03:44.628 --> 00:03:46.927
Um. I just wanted
to say thanks again.

51
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:49.201
You don't have to.

52
00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:51.831
I gave you some
standard HR advice.

53
00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:54.966
You landed that promotion
all on your own.

54
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.007
I told my dad
about it and he...

55
00:03:57.042 --> 00:03:59.003
almost hugged me.

56
00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.912
I think he was proud
or something.

57
00:04:01.948 --> 00:04:04.508
I'm sure he was.

58
00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:06.918
Yeah. Oh. listen.
we're going out for drinks
tonight to celebrate

59
00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.082
if you want to come.

60
00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:09.887
What?

61
00:04:09.923 --> 00:04:12.317
Drinks. With me.

62
00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.987
You in?

63
00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:16.627
Oh. Um...

64
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.299
And Samir is coming
and some of the IT girls.

65
00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:25.900
and I invited Jennifer.

66
00:04:26.972 --> 00:04:28.707
Jennifer...

67
00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:29.909
Nice.

68
00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:33.974
So you'll come?

69
00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:39.850
Thanks. Roshan.
but I have plans.

70
00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:41.949
Have fun.

71
00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:46.855
Bye!

72
00:05:02.036 --> 00:05:05.671
<i> Next stop.</i>
<i>University Avenue.</i>

73
00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.712
<i>St. Andrew Subway Station.</i>

74
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.000
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>you could take that guy down.</i>

75
00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:33.698
-He's fucking huge!
-I know.
what are you talking about?

76
00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.637
Honestly. the only
thing to do is you chip it and
you fuckin' go for it

77
00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:37.036
'cause that guy's a
monster. man.

78
00:05:37.072 --> 00:05:39.009
You're gonna get wrecked.
You should be scared.

79
00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:40.579
Carter!

80
00:05:45.715 --> 00:05:48.020
-What's up. coach?

81
00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:52.121
We're sendin' you down.

82
00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:55.420
Yeah. right.

83
00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.461
Really?

84
00:05:57.496 --> 00:06:01.091
Yeah.
there's a car waiting for you.

85
00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:04.267
Go back to the hotel.
Call your agent.

86
00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:06.969
Here's your per diem.

87
00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:08.367
No!

88
00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:10.134
Carter.

89
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.003
Okay. I've been
a little off. but I'm good now.

90
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.544
No.
you're not playing tonight.

91
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.606
coach. you know me.
This is what I do!

92
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:18.580
-I bounce back every time!
Tonight I've been focused--
-Carter.

93
00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:21.114
Carter. Carter!
Will you shut up?

94
00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:26.424
We needed you to work harder.

95
00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:28.395
You're a good player.
You really are.

96
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.594
Maybe you're back with us
next season. but...

97
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.296
we think this is
the best thing for ya.

98
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.170
The minors?

99
00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:39.866
I gotta go to fucking Syracuse?

100
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:43.210
No. you gotta
clear waivers first.

101
00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:45.575
Now. maybe it doesn't
take the full 24 hours.

102
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:49.074
Maybe another team
picks you up. but...

103
00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:53.379
yeah. you gotta stay
in town for the night.

104
00:06:53.414 --> 00:06:56.051
Cool.

105
00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:58.621
So I just sit and wait around
until someone else decides

106
00:06:58.656 --> 00:07:01.621
-the rest of my life?
-Look. Carter...

107
00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:04.459
I was you once. okay?

108
00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:07.094
I know how this feels.

109
00:07:13.337 --> 00:07:15.476
Take care. son.

110
00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:32.386
<i>Let's talk about Tampa Bay.</i>

111
00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:34.728
<i>the team that proved</i>
<i>last year it doesn't matter</i>
<i>what you do</i>

112
00:07:34.763 --> 00:07:37.990
<i>in the regular season as it's</i>
<i>a new year in the playoffs.</i>

113
00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:40.029
Hey. can you
change the station. bud?

114
00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:42.135
<i>...against the Leafs--</i>

115
00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:08.228
-Joni. hey.
-Grace!

116
00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:10.560
I told you I would
clean up the living room.

117
00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:12.993
and I will.
Just relax already. okay?

118
00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:15.627
Doing a pretty good
job cleaning up here.

119
00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:18.496
I got some leads on
a few apartments.

120
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.234
One of them is in the East End.
which sucks. but I'm trying.

121
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.001
I promise I wanna get off
your couch more than you do.

122
00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.205
I talked to Roshan.

123
00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.213
Oh. Oh!

124
00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:29.778
And?
Tell me what happened.

125
00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:31.952
I think he likes Jennifer now.
so...

126
00:08:31.987 --> 00:08:33.544
It doesn't matter.

127
00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:36.682
They all went out after work
to celebrate his promotion.

128
00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:37.815
Why didn't you go?

129
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.417
I'm not gonna tag along.
I'm not...

130
00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:43.429
Grace. I love you.
but you do this all the time.

131
00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:45.461
Just say yes
to something for once.

132
00:08:45.496 --> 00:08:47.393
I say yes all the time!

133
00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:50.769
-Do you?
-Yes.

134
00:08:50.804 --> 00:08:53.201
What about that cute guy
that worked at your food court?

135
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.404
He worked at Subway.

136
00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:58.235
Okay. um...
Charlie's friend.

137
00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.906
The guy who spent
New Year's with us.

138
00:08:59.942 --> 00:09:02.348
That guy?
He was a total player.

139
00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:04.151
Your neighbour.
the comedian dude?

140
00:09:04.553 --> 00:09:06.349
He has a girlfriend.
But not at first.

141
00:09:06.551 --> 00:09:07.784
And you totally liked him.

142
00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:09.879
No. I just felt like
I always had to laugh

143
00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:11.422
at his jokes.

144
00:09:11.457 --> 00:09:13.056
This is what you do. Grace.

145
00:09:13.091 --> 00:09:15.926
You like a guy. and then you
get to know him just long enough

146
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.499
to not like him anymore
so you don't have to date him.

147
00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:22.866
Why would I date
a guy I don't like?

148
00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:25.267
Because no guy is
ever good enough for Grace.

149
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.840
That's not true.

150
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:29.506
Really?

151
00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:34.212
Go talk to that guy over there.

152
00:09:34.247 --> 00:09:36.073
-No.
-Why not?

153
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.242
-Because he's a stranger.
-Exactly.

154
00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.752
You don't know
anything about him.

155
00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:42.080
For all you know. he could
be the love of your life.

156
00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:45.618
I doubt it.
He has a ponytail.

157
00:09:47.657 --> 00:09:49.055
When are
you coming home?

158
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.788
Uh. in a bit.
but I'm going out after.

159
00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:53.361
Where?

160
00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:54.967
Tunnel.

161
00:09:55.002 --> 00:09:56.095
Pass!

162
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.833
Of course you pass.
You always pass.

163
00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:00.333
Look where it's gotten you.
in bed by- 30 every night.

164
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.976
Grace!

165
00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.669
-Mr. Stone. you're back!
-Hey. Lisa.

166
00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:35.333
Uh. your gear just arrived.

167
00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.401
Oh. perfect.
Just leave it there for now.

168
00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.004
I think they made
a reservation for me.

169
00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.874
Of course.
Let me check.

170
00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:46.451
Here we go.
Deluxe suite. 10th floor.

171
00:10:46.486 --> 00:10:48.013
Oh. that won't be necessary.

172
00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:52.050
The team's covered the night.

173
00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:53.953
Lisa.
what's the nicest suite?

174
00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:56.659
Not the biggest. but the nicest.

175
00:10:56.694 --> 00:10:59.356
Like. if you were to stay here.

176
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:01.928
which room would
you sleep in tonight?

177
00:11:01.963 --> 00:11:03.995
The Wellington Suite
on 32.

178
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.764
The view is stunning.

179
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.436
Is it available?

180
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:09.303
Uh...

181
00:11:10.374 --> 00:11:11.509
It is!

182
00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:13.806
Perfect.
Upgrade me to that.

183
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:16.174
Oh. Mr. Stone. I--

184
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.342
First of all.
call me "Carter."

185
00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:21.687
And second.
it's on the team's dime.

186
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:25.154
A drop in the ocean for them.
you know?

187
00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:33.796
<i> Hi. you've reached</i>
<i>Dani Drake at Talent A.</i>

188
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:35.465
<i>Leave me a message.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

189
00:11:36.733 --> 00:11:38.961
Dani. I checked in.

190
00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:41.472
Now what?

191
00:11:41.507 --> 00:11:43.469
Call me back.

192
00:12:04.133 --> 00:12:05.297
Grace?

193
00:12:05.332 --> 00:12:09.434
I'm gonna go now.

194
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.965
I cleaned the living room.

195
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.670
You should come to Tunnel.

196
00:12:14.706 --> 00:12:19.045
Thursdays are so much fun.

197

How's it going?

Um. it's okay.

255
00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:41.032
I got a drink.

256
00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.502
Awesome.

257
00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:45.170

I'm really liking Marcus.

260
00:16:48.443 --> 00:16:50.013
You met him
like seven seconds ago.

261
00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:52.510
I know.
I just feel a connection.

262
00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:54.785
I... want to
go home with him.

263
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.952
-Joni...
-It's just...

264
00:16:56.987 --> 00:17:00.091
after Charlie. I. I...

265
00:17:00.126 --> 00:17:05.057
just really need this
tonight... you know?

266
00:17:05.093 --> 00:17:06.126
-Go.
-Really?

267
00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:07.326
-Yeah.

268
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.591
-Give us two hours.
-Okay.

269
00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:09.759
And then
you can come back.

270
00:17:09.794 --> 00:17:12.136
-What?!
-He lives with his parents.

271
00:17:12.172 --> 00:17:13.606
Joni. you need
to find your own place.

272
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:17.167
I know. I know. I know!

273
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.575
Go...

274
00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:20.174
Have sex.

275
00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:21.239
-Be happy.

276
00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:23.511
I love you.

277
00:17:23.546 --> 00:17:25.783
That lip gloss looks
great on you. by the way.

278
00:17:25.818 --> 00:17:27.677
-Thank you.
-Bye!

279
00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.379
-What--

280
00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:31.251
Oh my God.

281
00:17:31.287 --> 00:17:33.657
Hi. can we get.
um. some shots?

282
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.962
Oh my God.
I want that drink!

283
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.534
Sorry. I just
don't know what to do here.

284
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.297
Dani. I can't just sit around.

285
00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:48.737

286
00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:51.410

287
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.737
What?

288
00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:56.108
Sorry.
I'm just having a bad night.

289
00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:58.342
Oh.

290
00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.044
You going back in?

291
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.555
No.

292
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.281
Yeah. me neither.

293
00:18:05.316 --> 00:18:06.886
Um...

294
00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:09.291
Do you know if there's another
bar around here somewhere?

295
00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:11.787
It's downtown.
There's bars everywhere.

296
00:18:11.823 --> 00:18:13.790
Oh. yeah.
I'm not from here. so...

297
00:18:13.825 --> 00:18:15.965
I'm not really
a bar person. sorry.

298
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.204
That's okay.

299
00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:23.508
So. where are you heading now?

300
00:18:23.543 --> 00:18:25.302
Home.

301
00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:26.743
Well... sort of.

302
00:18:33.984 --> 00:18:35.951
Thanks.

303
00:18:35.987 --> 00:18:37.788

304
00:18:37.823 --> 00:18:39.086
Have a nice night.

305
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:41.588
Hey. Carter!

306
00:18:41.624 --> 00:18:43.996
We need to finish that
conversation. my friend.

307
00:18:44.032 --> 00:18:45.632
-Where you goin'?
-Hey. what the hell?

308
00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.032
-Drive.
-Excuse me!

309
00:18:47.067 --> 00:18:49.030
Sorry. I have to
get away from that guy.

310
00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:50.703
Uh. Dalton Hotel.

311
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:52.301
Sure. Just take my cab.

312
00:18:52.337 --> 00:18:55.870
It's fine.
It's just around the corner.

313
00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:58.807
Whatever.

314
00:18:58.842 --> 00:19:00.678
Thanks.

315
00:19:00.714 --> 00:19:02.709
<i> It costs £7</i>

316

-<i> Is this a...</i>

317
00:19:05.848 --> 00:19:08.254

318

320
00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:13.985

324

Dalton Hotel.

325
00:19:34.175 --> 00:19:36.414
Goodnight.

326
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.322
Crawford Street.
right?

327
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.486
Um...

328
00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:52.232
I'll get out here.

329
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:13.376
Are you okay?

330
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:16.214
I. um...

331
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.148
I-I dunno.

332
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:33.604
I just can't go home right now.

333
00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:36.307
My best friend's having her
weekly sexathon on my couch

334
00:20:36.342 --> 00:20:40.145
and now I'm homeless
for the next two hours.

335
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.843
The old sock
on the doorknob. huh?

336
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:07.098
I guess I can't
stay out here all night.

337
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.408
I guess
we could grab a drink and--

338
00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.318
Sure. let's go in!

339
00:21:37.332 --> 00:21:39.102
This is your room?

340
00:21:39.137 --> 00:21:41.198
Yeah. they upgraded me.

341
00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:46.869
What do you do?

342
00:21:46.904 --> 00:21:49.045
-Well. I. uh--
-Never mind.

343
00:21:49.081 --> 00:21:50.610
I don't wanna know.

344
00:21:50.646 --> 00:21:52.784
What do
you want to drink?

345
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.580
Um...

346
00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.781
What's over here?

347
00:21:58.816 --> 00:22:00.855
Uh. a bedroom?

348
00:22:25.215 --> 00:22:28.347
That view is...

349
00:22:28.383 --> 00:22:30.280
Yeah. I know.

350
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.325
This okay?

351
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.328
Mm-hm.

352
00:23:48.364 --> 00:23:50.592
Sure?

353
00:23:50.628 --> 00:23:52.571
Yes.

354
00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:08.516
A-OK.

355
00:24:08.552 --> 00:24:09.779
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

356
00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:13.385
Oh. no. keep going.

357
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.286
Okay.

358
00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:27.100
Oh. hold on.

359
00:24:54.232 --> 00:24:56.030
You can continue.

360
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.293
Um...

361
00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:26.790
What should I. um...

362
00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.867
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

363
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:31.365
Uh-huh...

364
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:33.765
It feels good.

365
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.534
-Okay.

366
00:25:45.283 --> 00:25:48.753
Um. it's just I...

367
00:25:48.788 --> 00:25:51.957
I've never done this.
but it feels-- what should I...

368
00:25:51.993 --> 00:25:52.990
What?

369
00:25:53.026 --> 00:25:54.785
Hmm? What?

370
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.753
What did you say?

371
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:59.096
It feels good?

372
00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:00.594
Before that.

373
00:26:00.629 --> 00:26:04.970
I've never done this.

374
00:26:05.006 --> 00:26:07.673
Define "this."

375
00:26:13.012 --> 00:26:17.743
This.

376
00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:20.312
I've never done this.

377
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.919
You've never had sex?

378
00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:33.295
Um... I-I have to go!

379
00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:36.297
Wait...

380
00:26:36.332 --> 00:26:38.434
Um...

381
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.334
Sorry. uh--
No. wait.

382
00:26:40.369 --> 00:26:43.470
Did...?

383
00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.074
Hey!
Wait!

384
00:26:57.223 --> 00:26:59.285
Are you okay?

385
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.318
This night has been
one humiliation after another.

386
00:27:03.354 --> 00:27:06.330
I don't even know
where I'm going.

387
00:27:06.366 --> 00:27:07.792
Want to go home?

388
00:27:07.828 --> 00:27:10.599
I'll take you home.

389
00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:13.499
Home!
I can't even go home.

390
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.776
I just want this night to end.

391
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:26.776
Let's go grab a drink.

392
00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:28.848
Alright?

393
00:27:28.883 --> 00:27:31.083
I mean. I'm sure there's...

394
00:27:31.118 --> 00:27:33.559
somewhere around here
we could go.

395
00:27:33.594 --> 00:27:36.357
I'm not from here
so I don't know. but...

396
00:27:36.593 --> 00:27:38.293
I could use a drink too.

397
00:27:41.133 --> 00:27:42.361
Okay.

398
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.166
Yeah?
Okay?

399
00:27:48.437 --> 00:27:51.306
Um...

400
00:27:51.342 --> 00:27:53.779
That way?

401
00:28:05.656 --> 00:28:08.885
I'm Carter. by the way.

402
00:28:08.921 --> 00:28:11.126
Grace.

403
00:28:23.534 --> 00:28:25.643
You think
they still have food?

404
00:28:25.678 --> 00:28:27.874
It says
the kitchen's closed.

405
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:29.380
What can I get you?

406
00:28:29.415 --> 00:28:30.948
Uh. a house red?

407
00:28:30.983 --> 00:28:33.442
I'll have a pilsner.
You still have food?

408
00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.687
Sorry.
kitchen just closed.

409
00:28:35.722 --> 00:28:37.520
Ah. no one
needs to cook anything.

410
00:28:37.555 --> 00:28:40.318
Just chips. crackers?

411
00:28:40.353 --> 00:28:42.451
We're both kind of
having a rough night.

412
00:28:42.486 --> 00:28:44.089
Let me
see what I can do.

413
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.864
Beautiful.
Thanks. man.

414
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.280
So. Grace...

415
00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:05.943
What do you do?

416
00:29:05.978 --> 00:29:07.909
I'm an HR adviser.

417
00:29:07.945 --> 00:29:09.354
Hm.

418
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:11.386
What do you do?

419
00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:13.991
Sales.

420
00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:20.626
Where are you from?

421
00:29:20.661 --> 00:29:24.200
Here.

422
00:29:24.236 --> 00:29:26.470
You?

423
00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:29.105
Montreal. originally.

424
00:29:49.463 --> 00:29:51.058
How have you
never had sex?

425
00:29:51.093 --> 00:29:53.028
Shh. tell the whole bar.
why don't you?

426
00:29:53.063 --> 00:29:57.865
Sorry.
this is all I have left.

427
00:29:57.901 --> 00:30:00.565
-Good for you. Grace?
-Sure!

428
00:30:03.337 --> 00:30:06.109
-Thanks. man.
-Yeah.

429
00:30:14.918 --> 00:30:16.352
I don't want
to talk about it.

430
00:30:16.387 --> 00:30:17.423
Okay.

431
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:19.815
We're not talking about it.

432
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.999
You wouldn't understand.

433
00:30:33.035 --> 00:30:35.798
Try me.
I honestly want to know.

434
00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:42.644
Would you say
most people have...

435
00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:45.909
eaten a hamburger?

436
00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:47.242
Yeah...?

437
00:30:47.477 --> 00:30:50.686
Some people
eat one a week.

438
00:30:50.721 --> 00:30:52.625
Some have two a week.

439
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.954
Exactly.
and some have never had one.

440
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.030
and that's me.

441
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.834
So is it. like...
a religious thing?

442
00:31:06.869 --> 00:31:09.967
Like you don't eat beef?

443
00:31:10.003 --> 00:31:14.680
No. I eat beef.

444
00:31:14.715 --> 00:31:17.845
Maybe you're
more of a salad person.

445
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.351
You prefer. you know...

446
00:31:21.386 --> 00:31:23.616
salads?

447
00:31:23.652 --> 00:31:24.784
No.

448
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.656
I want a burger.

449
00:31:26.691 --> 00:31:30.053
I've just never had...

450
00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:31.997
the full burger.

451
00:31:32.032 --> 00:31:34.426
I just think you need
to do it and get it over with.

452
00:31:34.628 --> 00:31:37.662
What do you think I was
trying to do ten minutes ago?

453
00:31:41.908 --> 00:31:45.303
Obviously.
I can't have just any burger.

454
00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:46.502
Maybe the first
one needs to be--

455
00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.471
It doesn't
need to be anything.

456
00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:49.844
Huh!
I don't want my first burger

457
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.443
to be some... mini slider

458
00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:56.948
like the last thing
from the kitchen.

459
00:31:56.983 --> 00:31:59.221
Yeah. okay.

460
00:31:59.257 --> 00:32:01.551
And I'm not having
some greasy drive-through one

461
00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.158
after a drunken night
at the club.

462
00:32:04.193 --> 00:32:07.124
Those can sometimes
be pretty great.

463
00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:09.663
Not for my first.

464
00:32:11.872 --> 00:32:13.939
I don't know.
maybe I've waited too long

465
00:32:13.975 --> 00:32:18.343
and now it's too late
to find the right burger.

466
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:37.889
How old are you?

467
00:32:37.924 --> 00:32:39.999
I'm 27.

468
00:32:44.499 --> 00:32:47.270
-Grace.
you need to have sex.
-Why?

469
00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:50.171
Who made the rule that
you have to do it before 27?

470
00:32:50.206 --> 00:32:51.676
Just because
everyone else does it

471
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:53.070
doesn't mean we all have to.

472
00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:57.781
You're right.

473
00:32:57.816 --> 00:33:00.778
It's cool you're okay with it.

474
00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:07.719
Well.
I'm not okay with it.

475
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.764
High school?

476
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.167
I went
to an all-girls school.

477
00:33:15.402 --> 00:33:16.726
University?

478
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.763
It was more trouble
than it was worth back then.

479
00:33:19.031 --> 00:33:20.100
How?

480
00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:21.301
In first year.
my roommate.

481
00:33:21.336 --> 00:33:23.001
she would get
into all these flings.

482
00:33:23.037 --> 00:33:24.338
So much drama.

483
00:33:24.374 --> 00:33:26.076
I swear. I spent half
the year in the library

484
00:33:26.111 --> 00:33:27.912
when she was having sex.
and the other half

485
00:33:27.948 --> 00:33:29.211
being her therapist
the next morning.

486
00:33:29.413 --> 00:33:32.080
Well. she's probably
married with seven kids by now.

487
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:35.750
No. she's having sex
on my couch.

488
00:33:35.786 --> 00:33:40.282
Oh.

489
00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:42.287
Really. though?

490
00:33:42.322 --> 00:33:44.258
Nothing all through university?

491
00:33:44.293 --> 00:33:45.828
Between classes
and taking care of Joni.

492
00:33:45.863 --> 00:33:47.430
it was a full-time job.

493
00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:50.799
Okay. but that was
what. six. seven years ago?

494
00:33:50.835 --> 00:33:53.438
Nothing since then?

495
00:33:53.473 --> 00:33:55.400
Not one guy?

496
00:33:55.436 --> 00:33:56.739
I've dated. Carter.
it's just--

497
00:33:56.775 --> 00:33:58.810
Just what?

498
00:33:58.846 --> 00:34:00.841
I'm an only child.
I'm reserved.

499
00:34:00.877 --> 00:34:02.138
It takes longer.

500
00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:04.109
Come on.

501
00:34:04.145 --> 00:34:05.242
Guys don't like me.

502
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.511
Of course they do.

503
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.546
No. I'm not the girl
who gets picked up at the bar.

504
00:34:09.582 --> 00:34:10.754
Meet someone
somewhere else then.

505
00:34:11.023 --> 00:34:13.686
But I don't.
It never happens for me.

506
00:34:16.696 --> 00:34:18.293
Maybe you're too picky.

507
00:34:18.328 --> 00:34:21.964
-So I lower my
standards?
-No.

508
00:34:21.999 --> 00:34:24.593
But what are your standards?

509
00:34:24.628 --> 00:34:27.873
Can any guy even reach them?

510
00:34:27.908 --> 00:34:32.343
I'm not gonna
settle for just any guy.

511
00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:36.777
Hmm.

512
00:34:36.812 --> 00:34:40.443
What?

513
00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:45.452
I don't know. maybe...

514
00:34:45.488 --> 00:34:48.927
Maybe you think you're
better than everyone?

515
00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:52.164
Maybe that's why
you've never had sex.

516
00:35:13.115 --> 00:35:16.212
What do you do again?

517
00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:18.322
Sales.

518
00:35:29.835 --> 00:35:34.538
So. tonight has been...

519
00:35:34.573 --> 00:35:36.798
Weird.

520
00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:41.144
I was going
to say "unexpected."

521
00:35:41.179 --> 00:35:46.343
Yeah.
I mean. that's what I meant.

522
00:35:46.379 --> 00:35:50.785
Well. I'm that way.

523
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.049
Oh...

524
00:35:57.157 --> 00:36:00.631
Bye. Carter.

525
00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:03.669
Bye. Grace.

526
00:36:03.704 --> 00:36:05.503
Thanks for the drinks.

527
00:36:05.538 --> 00:36:07.338
Sure.

528
00:36:25.492 --> 00:36:27.649
Hey!

529
00:36:27.684 --> 00:36:30.793
Are you still hungry?

530
00:36:31.028 --> 00:36:33.488
How much
older do I look?

531
00:36:33.523 --> 00:36:35.359
-30?
-30?

532
00:36:35.395 --> 00:36:36.866
You think I look 30?

533
00:36:36.901 --> 00:36:38.199
It's a compliment.

534
00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:39.933
Not when
you're 25. it isn't.

535
00:36:39.968 --> 00:36:41.238
Pssh!

536
00:36:41.274 --> 00:36:43.402
At least people don't
think you're a teenager.

537
00:36:43.437 --> 00:36:45.142
When I wear a hoodie and jeans.

538
00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:47.145
I look like
a high school student.

539
00:36:47.181 --> 00:36:49.907
Oh. so that's why
you dress like you're 40?

540
00:36:49.943 --> 00:36:52.578
I work in an office.
I need to look professional.

541
00:36:52.613 --> 00:36:55.112
Yeah.
I bet you fold up your clothes

542
00:36:55.147 --> 00:36:57.914
in neat little piles at night
before you go to bed too.

543
00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.057
Well. clearly.
you fling yours across the room

544
00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:02.325
and step on them
the next morning.

545
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.094
My stuff's crammed
into a carry-on all day.

546
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.224
-What's the point?

547
00:37:05.259 --> 00:37:07.459
Hotels have irons.

548
00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:10.133
No.
Who irons a hoodie?

549
00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:11.869
What exactly
do you sell?

550
00:37:11.905 --> 00:37:13.434
Sports equipment.

551
00:37:13.469 --> 00:37:15.631
Helmets. shoulder pads.
wrist guards.

552
00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:18.036
mouthpieces. jockstraps.

553
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:20.136
-Sweat-absorbent pants are
great.
-Okay. okay!

554
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.580
-They're revolutionary.
-Sorry I asked.

555
00:37:23.615 --> 00:37:26.742
♪

556
00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:28.447
And look. we're here.

557
00:37:28.482 --> 00:37:30.050
Great. I hate walking.

558
00:37:33.687 --> 00:37:37.292
I told you.
guys don't like me.

559
00:37:37.327 --> 00:37:38.392
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

560
00:37:40.362 --> 00:37:41.789
No.
I think we determined

561
00:37:41.825 --> 00:37:42.925
that you don't like guys.

562
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.270
I like guys.
It just rarely happens.

563
00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:48.367
Okay. how about
the first guy you liked. ever?

564
00:37:48.402 --> 00:37:50.674
Can you remember that?

565
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.144
It's dumb.

566
00:37:52.179 --> 00:37:53.669
-I don't think he counts.
-Yes. he does.

567
00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:57.840
Tell me.
What happened?

568
00:37:57.876 --> 00:38:02.615
I was. um.
I dunno. 14. on the bus.

569
00:38:02.651 --> 00:38:04.417
Not a school bus.
just a regular bus.

570
00:38:04.452 --> 00:38:05.954
Wearing
your school uniform?

571
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.391
Yes.

572
00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:09.386
And I was sitting
at the back reading a book.

573
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:10.995
Jane Austen?

574
00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:12.587
Can I tell
my own story here?

575
00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:15.299
Sorry. go ahead.

576
00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:19.496
So. the bus stops
and all these boys get on.

577
00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:21.733
teenagers my age.

578
00:38:21.768 --> 00:38:23.567
and of course
they head to the back.

579
00:38:23.603 --> 00:38:26.174
I keep my eyes on my book.

580
00:38:26.209 --> 00:38:27.505
but I can hear them all.

581
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.574
Um. then this one boy.

582
00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.551
he sits next to me.

583
00:38:34.586 --> 00:38:36.946
And you know when you sit
next to someone on the bus

584
00:38:36.982 --> 00:38:40.559
and your arms touch.
like here to here?

585
00:38:40.594 --> 00:38:41.652
Yeah.

586
00:38:41.687 --> 00:38:43.795
That's what
happened to us.

587
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.422
Our arms touched.

588
00:38:47.563 --> 00:38:49.492
And usually
you move away. you know?

589
00:38:49.528 --> 00:38:51.125
But we didn't.

590
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:54.538
We just sat there.
side by side. close.

591
00:38:56.842 --> 00:38:58.910
Then what?

592
00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:02.576
Then the
bus stops and...

593
00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:07.349
they all get off.
including the boy.

594
00:39:07.385 --> 00:39:09.086
What do you mean?
What'd you do?

595
00:39:09.122 --> 00:39:11.549
Nothing.
I didn't talk to him.

596
00:39:11.585 --> 00:39:13.218
I didn't even look at him.

597
00:39:13.254 --> 00:39:14.322
Not once?

598
00:39:14.358 --> 00:39:16.453
Not even when he
got off the bus?

599
00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:19.224
No. I just...

600
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.491
I didn't.

601
00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:23.132
I don't know why.

602
00:39:23.167 --> 00:39:24.464
Grace. what the fuck?

603
00:39:24.499 --> 00:39:26.633
I know!
Why did I do that?

604
00:39:26.668 --> 00:39:28.730
Yeah.
the first thing you should do

605
00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.306
is make eye contact.

606
00:39:30.342 --> 00:39:32.010
I mean.
if he said something to me

607
00:39:32.045 --> 00:39:33.178
I would have looked at him.

608
00:39:33.213 --> 00:39:34.671
No. you could
have said something.

609
00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:35.971
What was I going to say?

610
00:39:36.007 --> 00:39:38.448
Anything!
"Hi. hello. I like you."

611
00:39:38.484 --> 00:39:41.281
He would have
looked at me like I was crazy.

612
00:39:41.316 --> 00:39:42.777
But you liked him?

613
00:39:42.812 --> 00:39:44.823
I mean. I... I...

614
00:39:44.858 --> 00:39:46.482
No. I don't know.

615
00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.457
Okay...

616
00:39:48.492 --> 00:39:52.323
Some guy sat next
to you on the bus.

617
00:39:52.358 --> 00:39:54.163
Yeah.

618
00:39:54.198 --> 00:39:58.332
And you felt something?

619
00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:00.301
Did you or didn't you?

620
00:40:00.336 --> 00:40:02.804
I was 14.
I don't...

621
00:40:07.342 --> 00:40:08.737
-I did.
-Mm-hm.

622
00:40:08.772 --> 00:40:12.412
I felt something.

623
00:40:12.447 --> 00:40:15.954
I bet he liked you too.

624
00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:18.347
-I think he did.
-Mm-hm.

625
00:40:21.286 --> 00:40:25.293
It's funny. I always
thought that was a nice story.

626
00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:27.493
Pfft. but it really isn't!

627
00:40:27.528 --> 00:40:30.202
It's actually kinda sad.

628
00:40:30.237 --> 00:40:32.002
If you would
have just looked at him

629
00:40:32.038 --> 00:40:33.337
and said something.

630
00:40:33.372 --> 00:40:35.232
who knows
what could have happened.

631
00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:45.446
Where is this place?

632
00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:46.912
You're so impatient.

633
00:40:46.948 --> 00:40:49.749
Well. you've tricked me
into doing more walking.

634
00:40:49.784 --> 00:40:51.321
-Oh. we're close!
-I see your ways.

635
00:40:51.357 --> 00:40:53.621
It's a yellow door
with bars on it.

636
00:40:53.656 --> 00:40:55.453
With bars on it?
Where are you taking me?

637
00:40:55.489 --> 00:40:56.824
You'll like it.

638
00:40:56.859 --> 00:40:59.591
I haven't been in a while.
but you'll like it.

639
00:40:59.626 --> 00:41:01.129
Okay. well. it's cold.

640
00:41:01.165 --> 00:41:02.462
This isn't cold.

641
00:41:02.497 --> 00:41:04.467
You're from Montreal.

642
00:41:04.502 --> 00:41:06.466
Well. I haven't
lived there in years.

643
00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:08.136
Where do you live now?

644
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:09.669
Down south.

645
00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:12.503
Down south.
like South Carolina?

646
00:41:12.539 --> 00:41:14.505
Eh. more south.

647
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:16.011
South... Dakota?

648
00:41:16.046 --> 00:41:17.279
Mm-mm.

649
00:41:17.314 --> 00:41:19.447

-Uh-uh.

00:41:19.483 --> 00:41:20.942

Um. Somewhere
in between all that.

654
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:29.552
South Sudan?

655
00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.124
Florida.

656
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.230
Oh!

657
00:41:32.266 --> 00:41:34.462

-Mm. it's humid.

658

-Hmm!

659
00:41:36.235 --> 00:41:37.429

Uh. alligators.

661
00:41:39.234 --> 00:41:40.303
Oranges.

662

All that stuff.

Original.

682
00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:40.124
I'm at a bar.
Where else would I sit?

683
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:43.627
At a table.
The chairs are more comfortable.
My feet touch the ground.

684
00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:45.790
You can talk and have
an actual conversation

687

It's too loud at the bar.

688
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.370
I don't want to have to compete
with the music and the people.

689

Well. that's
when you get closer.

690
00:43:54.169 --> 00:43:56.665
You can lean in. whisper
in her ear. smell her perfume.

691
00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.211
I could read her body language
better when I'm at the bar.

692
00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:03.177

693

No.

694
00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:06.713

I don't understand.

721
00:45:12.646 --> 00:45:15.914
Hey. Carter!

722
00:45:15.949 --> 00:45:18.484
I was sent down
today. okay?

723
00:45:18.519 --> 00:45:21.159
Okay!

724
00:45:21.194 --> 00:45:22.750
Tampa dropped me.

725
00:45:22.785 --> 00:45:25.659
I'm on waivers. and if another
team doesn't pick me up

726
00:45:25.694 --> 00:45:26.861
in the next 12 hours.

727
00:45:26.897 --> 00:45:28.660
tomorrow I get on
a plane to Syracuse.

728
00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:30.335
Fuck Syracuse!

729
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:34.129
I can't play in the minors.

730
00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:36.306
Why not?
Is that bad?

731
00:45:36.342 --> 00:45:38.909
Grace. I was fired.

732
00:45:52.957 --> 00:45:55.354
Technically. it sounds
like you were demoted.

733
00:46:01.059 --> 00:46:05.700
But I... I understand.

734
00:46:05.735 --> 00:46:09.467
There's
nothing I can do.

735
00:46:12.838 --> 00:46:15.640
Let's go.

736
00:46:15.675 --> 00:46:17.940
Where?

737
00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:20.819
Just come on.

738
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:28.486
Come on!

739
00:46:39.466 --> 00:46:41.300
<i> The rink's</i>
<i>closing in 15 minutes.</i>

740
00:46:41.336 --> 00:46:43.298
<i>Please return your rentals</i>
<i>to the front desk.</i>

741
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.033
<i>Rentals to the front desk.</i>

742
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:46.369
Come on. Carter.

743
00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:49.139
-Hurry up!
-This is stupid.

744
00:46:49.174 --> 00:46:52.276
So what you
do is stupid?

745
00:46:52.312 --> 00:46:54.045
What I do
isn't figure skating

746
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.444
in the middle of the night.

747
00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.114
Yeah.
figure skating is ten times

748
00:46:57.149 --> 00:46:58.882
more entertaining than hockey.

749
00:46:58.918 --> 00:47:00.219
Really?

750
00:47:00.255 --> 00:47:02.417
A bunch of dudes
trying to get a piece of rubber

751
00:47:02.453 --> 00:47:05.991
into a net?
What's the big deal?

752
00:47:06.026 --> 00:47:08.465
You're
gonna hurt yourself.

753
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.825
Are you coming or not?

754
00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:13.294
Not.

755
00:47:13.329 --> 00:47:15.837
Whoa. whoa...
Ah!

756
00:47:15.872 --> 00:47:17.473
Do you even
know how to skate?

757
00:47:17.575 --> 00:47:20.071
Whoa. oh my God.
Whoa...

758
00:47:20.106 --> 00:47:23.037
-Grace?
-Whoa. oh my God.

759
00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:26.876
Whoa!

760
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.679
Gotcha.

761
00:47:28.715 --> 00:47:29.685
Bye.

Everywhere else. men won't
shut up about it. but you...

Come on. tell me.

767
00:47:41.059 --> 00:47:44.299

00:49:27.471 --> 00:49:29.472

794
00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:32.875
I just love it.

795
00:49:32.911 --> 00:49:37.012
I'm an HR adviser.
I can help you.

796
00:49:37.047 --> 00:49:39.580

a DISC assessment.

Myers-Briggs is ideal
but too long.

No.
you can't be in there!

Oh--

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:26.921
You can't sit there!

827
00:51:26.957 --> 00:51:28.223
Well. I just did.

828
00:51:28.258 --> 00:51:29.594
Do you want me
to help you or not?

829
00:51:29.629 --> 00:51:31.055
Yeah. help me.

831
00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.631
Uh. hello.

832
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:36.962
Ugh!

833
00:51:36.998 --> 00:51:39.236
Okay. get off!

834
00:51:50.482 --> 00:51:52.174
What?

835
00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:53.849
Try it.

836
00:51:53.884 --> 00:51:55.945
You know you want to.

837
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.904
-Interesting.
-What?

838
00:52:19.939 --> 00:52:22.841
Your position sounds like
it has very dominant qualities.

839
00:52:22.876 --> 00:52:26.006
but according to this assessment
your behavioural tendencies

840
00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:28.719
lean more towards
private analytical traits.

841
00:52:28.755 --> 00:52:31.621
Accuracy is your strength.

842
00:52:31.656 --> 00:52:32.889
Meaning...?

843
00:52:33.191 --> 00:52:34.892
Are you sure you're
supposed to play centre?

844
00:52:34.928 --> 00:52:36.958
Yes.
I'm supposed to play centre.

845
00:52:36.994 --> 00:52:38.227
I've always played centre.

846
00:52:38.262 --> 00:52:39.624
Okay. I'm just
interpreting the results.

847
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.098
Okay. well. let's
interpret something else.

848
00:52:42.133 --> 00:52:43.691
Let's go back
to your options.

849
00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.698
-What are they?

850
00:52:45.733 --> 00:52:49.139
One. you get picked by another
team and stay in the NHL

851
00:52:49.174 --> 00:52:52.171
or. two. you get sent
down for the minors

852
00:52:52.206 --> 00:52:53.968
and play for Syracuse.

853
00:52:54.003 --> 00:52:55.746
Now. both options
have their advantages--

854
00:52:55.781 --> 00:52:57.548
There's a third option.

855
00:52:57.584 --> 00:52:59.011
Oh. okay. great.

856
00:52:59.046 --> 00:53:02.046
What is it?

857
00:53:02.081 --> 00:53:04.082
I quit.

858
00:53:04.117 --> 00:53:06.451
You'd quit?

859
00:53:06.486 --> 00:53:07.658
You asked
for all the options.

860
00:53:07.693 --> 00:53:10.089
That's an option.

861
00:53:10.124 --> 00:53:12.156
No. you're right.

862
00:53:12.191 --> 00:53:15.296
Three. quit.

863
00:53:15.332 --> 00:53:17.200
So what's your least
desirable option.

864
00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:20.299
the one you absolutely
do not want to do?

865
00:53:20.334 --> 00:53:22.631
I think
it's pretty obvious.

866
00:53:22.667 --> 00:53:24.401
Right.
number two. Syracuse.

867
00:53:25.672 --> 00:53:26.975
Let's talk about it
in general terms.

868
00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.177
I really don't want to.

869
00:53:28.212 --> 00:53:29.946
What does
going to Syracuse entail?

870
00:53:29.981 --> 00:53:32.277
Less money?
Less prestige?

871
00:53:32.312 --> 00:53:33.584
Less high-level play?

872
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.281
Less everything.

873
00:53:36.316 --> 00:53:37.949
Oh. I forgot something.

874
00:53:37.985 --> 00:53:40.825
Why do you think you're being
sent down in the first place?

875
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.626
Because
they think I suck.

876
00:53:43.661 --> 00:53:45.395
Do you?

877
00:53:51.066 --> 00:53:53.194
-Carter.
-Grace.

878
00:54:13.357 --> 00:54:17.153
I guess maybe
I'm not working hard enough.

879
00:54:17.189 --> 00:54:19.963
Why?

880
00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:23.526
We travel a lot.
It's stressful.

881
00:54:23.562 --> 00:54:27.300
Can't always stay focused.

882
00:54:27.335 --> 00:54:28.829
But everyone's
travelling.

883
00:54:28.864 --> 00:54:31.039
Not all players get sent down.

884
00:54:31.075 --> 00:54:32.707
And you're taken care of.

885
00:54:32.742 --> 00:54:34.911
I mean. how stressful is it
to stay in five-star hotels

886
00:54:34.946 --> 00:54:36.579
and fly private jets?

887
00:54:36.615 --> 00:54:40.284
You don't even have a family.
You have none of those stresses.

888
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.877
I thought this was
supposed to make me feel better.

889
00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:47.217
Why...
Why has your game deteriorated?

890
00:54:47.253 --> 00:54:48.289
Pressure.

891
00:54:48.325 --> 00:54:49.960
Where is
the pressure coming from?

892
00:54:49.995 --> 00:54:53.191
-Everyone.
-Name them. who?

893
00:54:55.198 --> 00:54:59.164
My coach. my team. the fans.

894
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.969
I don't know.

895
00:55:03.005 --> 00:55:05.910
Your dad?

896
00:55:05.945 --> 00:55:07.674
I don't
even know my dad.

897
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.445
But he's the reason
you started playing. right?

898
00:55:10.648 --> 00:55:13.541
You feel like you have to
live up to his expectations?

899
00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:15.276
That's pressure.

900
00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:17.919
You play and he doesn't show up.
so you play harder.

901
00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:19.079
You keep going.

902
00:55:19.114 --> 00:55:23.792
You make it to the NHL.

903

905

you'll never meet him.

906
00:55:32.302 --> 00:55:34.836

I stopped trying.

907
00:55:34.871 --> 00:55:39.041
Yeah.

908
00:55:39.076 --> 00:55:42.072
I don't know.

909
00:55:56.492 --> 00:55:59.854

so few people do.

910
00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.198

911
00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:04.700

to the highest level.

912

You went all the way.

915
00:56:16.281 --> 00:56:20.710

is do it again.

916
00:56:20.745 --> 00:56:23.949

01:06:14.744 --> 01:06:16.079
<i> I don't get it.</i>

1083
01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:20.441
I thought she liked me.

1084
01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:25.114
She said. "I like you."
I think.

1085
01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.713
I'm sure she did.

1086
01:06:28.791 --> 01:06:32.220
Then what happened?

1087
01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:35.992
I don't know. man.

1088
01:06:36.028 --> 01:06:38.365
What do I do?

1089
01:06:41.339 --> 01:06:42.567
Dunno.

1090
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.475
You like her?

1091
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:48.636
Yeah.

1092
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:52.214
No. I mean.
like. really like her.

1093
01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:55.745
'Cause women like Grace.
they see right through you.

1094
01:06:57.655 --> 01:07:00.918
If you really want her.

1095
01:07:00.953 --> 01:07:05.389
go get her.

1096
01:07:05.424 --> 01:07:08.098
You think
she's playing hard to get?

1097
01:07:11.365 --> 01:07:14.236
No. I think
she actually is hard to get.

1098
01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:35.609
Fuck! It's three
in the morning!

1099
01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.447
-It's me.
-Who?

1100
01:08:37.483 --> 01:08:40.389
It's Carter.
Let me in!

1101
01:08:40.425 --> 01:08:41.549
No.

1102
01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:42.825
Grace. it's freezing!

1103
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:46.622
-What!

1104
01:08:46.657 --> 01:08:48.630
I think I woke
your neighbours up.

1105
01:08:48.665 --> 01:08:50.631
Shh!

1106
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:54.301
Sorry.

1107
01:08:54.336 --> 01:08:57.069
How'd you know where I live?

1108
01:08:57.104 --> 01:08:59.371
The first cab we took.

1109
01:08:59.406 --> 01:09:03.879
You told the driver
your address.

1110
01:09:03.915 --> 01:09:06.677
-You remembered that?
-Yeah.

1111
01:09:06.713 --> 01:09:09.918
Well. 27 is. like.
Niedermayer's number and. uh.

1112
01:09:09.953 --> 01:09:11.714
Crawford. like Corey Crawford.

1113
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:14.455
-He was goalie for Chicago.
-Never mind.

1114
01:09:18.155 --> 01:09:19.761
Messy.

1115
01:09:19.797 --> 01:09:22.859
Didn't expect that.

1116
01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:28.931
What do you want?

1117
01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:40.250
Just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

1118
01:09:45.150 --> 01:09:47.147
I'm okay.

1119
01:09:52.158 --> 01:09:54.596
What's over here?

1120
01:09:54.631 --> 01:09:56.992
Bedroom.

1121
01:10:03.039 --> 01:10:06.137
Huh.
this is what I expected.

1122
01:10:36.102 --> 01:10:38.640
Jane Austen.

1123
01:10:38.676 --> 01:10:40.442
I knew it.

1124
01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:51.920
You have a view.

1125
01:10:51.955 --> 01:10:54.786

1166
01:18:01.582 --> 01:18:02.875

Coffee?

1167
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:07.216

01:18:11.829 --> 01:18:14.259
Look. Grace. I'm sorry
that I left you last night.

1171
01:18:14.294 --> 01:18:16.824
but we don't have to do this
whole passive-aggressive thing

1172
01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:19.969
this morn--

1173
01:18:20.004 --> 01:18:23.633

1175
01:18:26.406 --> 01:18:27.638
Coffee?

1176
01:18:27.673 --> 01:18:31.407
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

1177
01:18:31.442 --> 01:18:34.516
Grace. aren't you gonna
introduce us to your friend?

1178
01:18:34.551 --> 01:18:36.580
Holy shit.
you're Carter Stone!

1179
01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:38.217
You know him?

1180
01:18:38.252 --> 01:18:40.488
-He plays for Tampa.
-Actually. L.A. now.

1181
01:18:40.523 --> 01:18:41.621
-Yeah.
-Really?

1182
01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:43.082
-Mm-hm!
-When'd that happen?

1183
01:18:43.117 --> 01:18:44.285
Uh. I'm confused.

1184
01:18:44.321 --> 01:18:46.492
Grace. I have to go.
My car is waiting.

1185
01:18:46.561 --> 01:18:49.832
Oh. okay.
Yeah!

1186
01:18:52.202 --> 01:18:54.870
Bye. Carter.

1187
01:18:57.103 --> 01:19:00.634
-Bye. Grace.

1188
01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:10.252
Huh!

1189
01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:11.912
I can't believe it.

1190
01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.122
You did it!

1191
01:19:13.158 --> 01:19:14.613
It's nothing.

1192
01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:17.521
Grace. did you see
the way he looked at you?

1193
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:19.692
-What?
-He's into you.

1194
01:19:19.727 --> 01:19:23.091
<i>-Really </i> into you!
-Ah!

1195
01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.268
He looks at everyone like that.

1196
01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:27.199
I don't think he does.

1197
01:19:27.568 --> 01:19:28.828
He's going to L.A.

1198
01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:30.000
So?

1199
01:19:30.036 --> 01:19:32.905
So. it was
just a one-time thing.

1200
01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.510
Grace. you're just gonna let
him go?

1201
01:19:35.546 --> 01:19:37.179
I'm gonna
be late for work.

1202
01:19:37.215 --> 01:19:38.613
Ugh. that's it?

1203
01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:39.943
I'll tell you
everything later.

1204
01:19:39.978 --> 01:19:42.247
Right now. I really have to go.

1205

Good morning.
Welcome to the Dalton--

1240
01:22:01.685 --> 01:22:03.722
I need your help!
I'm looking for Carter Stone.

1241
01:22:03.757 --> 01:22:04.958
Is he still here?

1242
01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:07.323
I... I'm sorry. I can't
reveal guest information.

1243
01:22:07.358 --> 01:22:09.657
No. I know him.
He was in the. um...

1244
01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:11.660
Wellington Suite.
We spent the night together.

1245
01:22:12.965 --> 01:22:14.526
It's not what you think.

1246
01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.969
Actually. it is what you
think...

1247
01:22:16.004 --> 01:22:17.138
I just need to
tell him something.

1248
01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:18.904
Is he still here?

1249
01:22:18.939 --> 01:22:23.406
He checked out.
I'm sorry.

1250
01:22:23.442 --> 01:22:28.350
But if it helps.
we sent his gear to the airport.

1251
01:22:28.386 --> 01:22:29.914
Right. Pearson.

1252
01:22:29.949 --> 01:22:32.646
No. the Island Airport.

1253
01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:36.190
But you can't fly to
L.A. from the Island.

1254
01:22:38.928 --> 01:22:43.659
Island Airport.
as fast as you can.

1255
01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:53.006
Yup. I got it.

1256
01:22:53.042 --> 01:22:56.377
I'll be in Syracuse
in a couple hours.

1257
01:22:56.412 --> 01:22:58.547
Mm-hm.

1258
01:22:58.583 --> 01:23:03.881
Yeah. I'll call you then.

1259
01:23:03.916 --> 01:23:05.879
Dani. I gotta go.

1260
01:23:11.452 --> 01:23:12.957
