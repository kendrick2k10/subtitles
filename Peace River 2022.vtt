Your grandmother's grandfather

4
00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:23.130
came out here in 1873
after the Civil War.

5
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.598
Family lore has it
when he topped Johnson Mesa

6
00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:33.506
and he looked down
at this valley

7
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:38.475
and saw buffalo and antelope
belly deep in a sea of grass.

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.878
with the Sangre de Christos
behind him.

9
00:00:41.014 --> 00:00:42.579
he knew this was it.

10
00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.713
Your people have
been here ever since.

11
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.766
Now me. I was born
in Louisiana.

12
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.732
came out here after the war.

13
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.172
I was a wandering soul.
looking for a North Star.

14
00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:10.672
And I found it right here in
this valley along this river.

15
00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.184
To me. this is
the Peace River.

16
00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:21.650
I feel peace
every time I look at it.

17
00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.455
Casey. what you want to
be when you grow up?

18
00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:28.261
A cowboy.
just like you. Pop.

19
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.169
Well. you come from
a long line of cowboys.

20
00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:38.834
The cowboy loves big
sky and open range.

21
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.310
Works hard.
is a man of his word.

22
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.173
Loyal to his friends
and family.

23
00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:50.250
Treats everyone with respect.
especially women.

24
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.619
Is courageous.
fearing God and no man.

25
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.589
Don't ever forget
what's important.

26
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:05.727
Friendship with God.
Family. Friends.

27
00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:11.337
Meaningful work
and one good horse.

28
00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:19.140
Never make the mistake
of measuring wealth by money.

29
00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:20.543
You do that.

30
00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.778
and you'll be a rich man
and a good cowboy.

31
00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:26.946

33
00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:38.663
I met your grandmother
on the spring round-up.

34
00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.467
I loved her from
the first time I saw her.

35
00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:45.734
The love of a good woman
can save your life.

36
00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:48.936
When I came back
from the war.

37
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.576
I had shrapnel in places
the doctors couldn't get to.

38
00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:55.281
The doctor said
I better live well

39
00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:57.845
because I probably
wouldn't live long.

40
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.283
Son. that was 40 years ago.

41
00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:03.257

Well. what do you think?

48
00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:32.717
He's beautiful.

49
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.856
Well. you know.
at the end of the day.

50
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:37.323
cowboyin' is teamwork.

51
00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:40.294
Cowboy is only as good
as his horse.

52
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.458
So I've been looking for
your one for a while.

53
00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:44.630
I think this may
be the one.

54
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.863
Now. listen. he got
a lot of cow in him.

55
00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.064
so don't you be trying
to teach him anything.

56
00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.102
If you pay attention.
he'll teach you something.

57
00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:55.406
Okay?

58
00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:57.509
All right.
Go see what you think.

59
00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.820
His name is Pecos.

60
00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:21.995
Hey. Pecos.
I'm Casey.

61
00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.966
And I'm gonna take
good care of you.

62
00:04:31.212 --> 00:04:33.076
Casey. slow it down. buddy.

63
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:34.645
Okay. that's it.

64
00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.861
Hey. you kids
stick together.

65
00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:50.793
No running!

66
00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:54.434
Those kids were born running.

67
00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.310
That'll be two bits.

68
00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:07.114
Drop it in
Bo's jar on the way out.

69
00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:09.345
Little Casey
had a head start.

70
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.978
Two bits all the same.

71
00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:17.318
- Hey. Casey.
- Oh. no.

72
00:05:18.354 --> 00:05:21.323
I guess you Shanes will take
in any strays. even beaners.

73
00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:22.759
You are so stupid.

74
00:05:22.894 --> 00:05:25.597
That's funny.
coming from a fence jumper.

75
00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:34.508
Mr. Shane. I appreciate
you coming in today.

76
00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:36.976
Yesterday on the playground.
there was an altercation

77
00:05:37.112 --> 00:05:38.379
with your grandson.

78
00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:41.743
We have a zero tolerance
policy for fighting.

79
00:05:41.878 --> 00:05:44.044
He needs to be suspended
for a day.

80
00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:46.920
I don't understand.

81
00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:48.554
What did I do wrong?

82
00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.919
Well. Case.
you had good intentions

83
00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:54.795
of defending Maria's
dignity and honor.

84
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:58.465
But the problem is.
you delivered the first blow.

85
00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:01.232
There's only two blows
a cowboy

86
00:06:01.368 --> 00:06:02.930
ought to deliver for sure.

87
00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:05.769
That's the second one
and the last one.

88
00:06:07.574 --> 00:06:08.871
You know.
if everybody responded

89
00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:11.842
to every verbal provocation
in this world.

90
00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:14.910
civilization
would come unglued.

91
00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:28.726
You okay?

92
00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:32.694
Grandma. you reckon
he's still mad at me?

93
00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:35.799
Heck. no.
he ain't mad at you.

94
00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:39.935
Casey. that man loves you
more than you can know.

95

100

Man. your daddy
was something else.

101

Full of life and laughter.

102
00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:51.375
As the cowboys would say.
he was a man

to ride the river with.

104
00:07:54.347 --> 00:07:55.780
What a cowboy.

105
00:07:56.982 --> 00:07:59.916
That boy could ride
the hair off a bull.

And you know.
when I look at you.

107

I often think
I'm looking at him.

Why did God let my daddy die?

109

Case. there are some things

it's hard
to understand or explain.

111

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:21.330
I love you forever.

180
00:14:47.924 --> 00:14:49.193
You know. Pop...

181
00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.559
been thinking a little
more about it lately.

182
00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:57.597
I think I might just join
the Army after graduation.

183
00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:02.207
Casey. this family's

184
00:15:02.343 --> 00:15:04.973
done enough military service
for several families.

185
00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:06.475
You don't have to do that.

186
00:15:07.312 --> 00:15:08.877
Pop. I know the family's
done enough.

187
00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:10.445
but I ain't done enough.

188
00:15:12.447 --> 00:15:13.916
What about college and rodeo?

189
00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:15.921
See. I figure this way.

190
00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:18.250
get the service
out of the way.

191
00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:20.221
before I got me a wife.

192
00:15:20.356 --> 00:15:22.093
Couple grandkids
for you. huh?

193
00:15:22.228 --> 00:15:23.524
You know.
there's a little prerequisite

194
00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:26.393
to that kid's deal.
You got anybody in mind?

195
00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:30.131
Ah. I figured Maria
would do. Huh?

196
00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:32.601
Boy. I sure do like that
little lady.

197
00:15:33.504 --> 00:15:36.205
Case. it's a profound
and powerful thing

198
00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:38.473
to stand on the wall
for your country.

199
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.510
Not something to be entered
into lightly.

200
00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:48.386
The young men
we send into battle

201
00:15:49.222 --> 00:15:51.624
are riding point
into the gates of hell.

202
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.388
You gotta be ready for it.

203
00:15:53.523 --> 00:15:55.996
You gotta take
Almighty God with you.

204
00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:58.865
It's a serious decision.

205
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.367
something you need
to be ready for.

206
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:02.261
Yes. sir.

207
00:16:02.397 --> 00:16:04.103
You think you're ready?

208
00:16:05.638 --> 00:16:06.699
Yes. sir.

209
00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:09.706
I'm gonna tell you what:

210
00:16:09.842 --> 00:16:11.077
I believe in you.

211
00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:13.543
You know. you're a good man.

212
00:16:14.512 --> 00:16:17.017
Whatever you decide.
I'm gonna support it.

213
00:16:19.752 --> 00:16:21.186
Thanks. Pop.

214
00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:41.467
I know.

215
00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:44.308
- You know.
- I'm late.

216
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.310
Maria. I've been thinking.

217
00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:50.347
Well. now.
that's a scary thing.

218
00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:56.716
No. it's about us
and the future.

219
00:16:57.718 --> 00:17:00.126
Are you trying
to propose to me?

220
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.130
More like wanting to know if
you're willing to wait for me.

221
00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:07.463
Willing to wait for you
to do what?

222
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.104
I'm joining the Army
after graduation.

223
00:17:15.376 --> 00:17:17.238
Maria. four generations
of Shane men have served

224
00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:19.145
and I can't break that chain.

225
00:17:20.613 --> 00:17:24.781
Casey. God doesn't want you
to do something for me.

226
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.254
He wants you to be the man
that he created you to be.

227
00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:36.855
Would I wait?

228
00:17:42.001 --> 00:17:43.466
I wouldn't like it.

229
00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:45.435
But yes.

230
00:17:46.303 --> 00:17:47.939
- Yes?
- I'd wait.

231
00:17:48.075 --> 00:17:49.604
- You'll wait?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:57.712
<i> Welcome.</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

233
00:17:57.847 --> 00:18:00.252
<i>to the National</i>
<i>High School Finals Rodeo.</i>

234
00:18:16.364 --> 00:18:17.700
All right. Casey.

235
00:18:18.503 --> 00:18:21.503
All the big
rodeo colleges are here

236
00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:24.236
and they're talking
about you. son.

237
00:18:25.139 --> 00:18:28.643
PBR's here too sniffing around.
looking for talent.

238
00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:31.415
And you've drawn

239
00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:35.321
a really good bull tonight
for this go round.

240
00:18:35.457 --> 00:18:38.050
I want you to stick
your toes out. hang your spurs

241
00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:42.261
in his hide and ride like
Old Freckles Brown on Tornado.

242
00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:45.396
How are you feeling. Maria?

243
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.235
Good.
Little nervous.

244
00:18:50.565 --> 00:18:51.864
There'd be something wrong

245
00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:53.734
if you weren't just
a little bit nervous.

246
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.683
<i>And as we go to</i>

<i>Oh. All over him.</i>

293
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:13.810
<i>Let's see what happens.</i>

294
00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:15.513
<i>We got to see what happened</i>
<i>on him right here.</i>

295
00:21:15.648 --> 00:21:17.877
<i>He's holding</i>
<i>that arm a little bit.</i>

296
00:21:18.013 --> 00:21:19.952
<i>I am getting confirmation.</i>
<i>though.</i>

297
00:21:20.088 --> 00:21:22.021
<i>it was an 8-second ride.</i>

298
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.622
<i>I think we're in business.</i>

299
00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:26.391
<i>So he's two up. two down.</i>
<i>two in the books.</i>

300
00:21:26.527 --> 00:21:28.086
<i>But they got</i>
<i>to check him out.</i>

301
00:21:29.825 --> 00:21:31.292
It's gonna be
all right. Casey.

302
00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:32.594
Hey. everybody.

303
00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:34.934
Hey. Casey.
got some bad news.

304
00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:36.334
We got your results back.

305
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.169
You have a fracture
of the radius.

306
00:21:38.305 --> 00:21:39.931
It's not all the way through.

307
00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:41.572
but it's structurally
compromised.

308
00:21:41.707 --> 00:21:44.204
You're not gonna be able
to ride in the finals.

309
00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:45.741
Sorry.

310
00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:54.217
Hey. Doc. what's the lightest
and strongest cast you got?

311
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.782
I know what you're thinking.
son. it's not a good idea.

312
00:21:57.918 --> 00:21:59.821
Man. if you rebreak this arm.

313
00:21:59.956 --> 00:22:02.323
you could have some
serious permanent damage.

314
00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:03.691
No. but. look. hey.

315
00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:05.794
I got another one
that looks just like it.

316
00:22:06.663 --> 00:22:08.430
You're not ambidextrous.
are you?

317
00:22:08.565 --> 00:22:09.863
Well. I wasn't until today.

318
00:22:09.998 --> 00:22:12.702
So. come on. Doc.
give me the best you got.

319
00:22:16.939 --> 00:22:19.038
Okay. Maria.
you've got your strategy

320
00:22:19.173 --> 00:22:21.679
all worked out and settled
in your mind?

321
00:22:21.814 --> 00:22:24.015
Well. yeah. but I don't
think I can take the lead

322
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:25.682
with a standard run.

323
00:22:27.385 --> 00:22:29.119
I want to go for the win.

324
00:22:29.254 --> 00:22:30.482
That's my girl.

325
00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:33.286
<i> All right.</i>
<i>let's go to the young lady</i>

326
00:22:33.422 --> 00:22:35.990
<i>that is still in the hunt</i>
<i>for that aggregate title.</i>

327
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:38.497
<i>She came in close</i>
<i>in the second round.</i>

328
00:22:38.632 --> 00:22:41.500
<i>Here she comes</i>
<i>for number three.</i>

329
00:22:44.704 --> 00:22:46.736
<i>Maria Martinez</i>
<i>through the first.</i>

330
00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:49.438
<i>Around it. good.</i>

331
00:22:49.574 --> 00:22:50.972
<i>Oh. this is looking good.</i>

332
00:22:51.107 --> 00:22:53.208
<i>Headed to number two.</i>
<i>tight. best barrel</i>

333
00:22:53.343 --> 00:22:57.742
<i>of the performance so far.</i>
<i>now the elusive number three.</i>

334
00:22:57.878 --> 00:22:59.617
<i>it's the money barrel.</i>

335
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:02.247
<i>Oh. oh. oh no!</i>
<i>She didn't need that.</i>

336
00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:05.656
<i>No. no. no. It's a penalty</i>
<i>of five seconds.</i>

337
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:07.724
<i>That's going to hurt her</i>
<i>in that average</i>

338
00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:10.192
<i>and take her completely</i>
<i>out of this run.</i>

339
00:23:10.327 --> 00:23:11.794
Hey. girl.

340
00:23:13.129 --> 00:23:18.504
Look. it's a sport
of inches and microseconds.

341
00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:21.699
You did the right thing.

342
00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:23.476
Hold your head up.

343
00:23:24.244 --> 00:23:26.204
I'm so proud of you.

344
00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:31.448
<i> Now. ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen. we just got</i>

345
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:33.785
<i>confirmation that Casey Shane</i>

346
00:23:33.921 --> 00:23:35.580
<i>is the national High School</i>
<i>champion bull rider.</i>

347

00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:35.698
Seven?
Seven people?

523
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:39.302
Dude. that's almost like
the size of Detroit.

524
00:36:39.438 --> 00:36:41.371
and we got 700.000
people there.

525
00:36:41.506 --> 00:36:43.403
Y'all got seven
people on the ranch?

526
00:36:43.538 --> 00:36:45.310
Dude. I know you get lonely.

527
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.939
No. man. it's...

528
00:36:48.981 --> 00:36:50.610
it's paradise.

529
00:36:50.746 --> 00:36:52.009
Just come out
and see it some time

530
00:36:52.144 --> 00:36:53.815
and you'll know
what I'm talking about.

531
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.816
I just might have to take you
up on that offer. man.

532
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:58.323
But first. is there
any Black people out there?

533
00:36:58.458 --> 00:37:00.622
- We ain't got no Black people.
- What?

534
00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:03.854
Man. you're telling me
you want me to come

535
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.465
to a place where
there's no Black folk.

536
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.402
a few white folk and a whole
lot of empty space?

537
00:37:12.268 --> 00:37:13.330
Yeah. a'ight.

538
00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:16.505
Why are there no Black people
out there. man?

539
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.243
You know. honestly.
I have no idea.

540
00:37:18.379 --> 00:37:20.973
It's kind of funny
'cause Black cowboys

541
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:23.744
were some of the first people
to settle the West.

542
00:37:26.585 --> 00:37:28.816
Well. look. man.
I'm definitely interested.

543
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:31.920
And I just may have to
take you up on that offer.

544
00:37:32.055 --> 00:37:33.287
Maybe.

545
00:37:33.423 --> 00:37:34.855
Gonna have to count us in.

546
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:37.595
What. they let the riffraff
in here this morning?

547
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.330
In? You guys are supposed
to be in 20 minutes ago. man.

548
00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:42.330
Hey. government time.
Government time.

549
00:37:42.465 --> 00:37:44.430
Tu. what you say. next game?

550
00:37:44.565 --> 00:37:46.469
So. since we're all here.

551
00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:48.640
what made you join
the military. Casey?

552
00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:50.441
Oh. uh...

553
00:37:51.643 --> 00:37:53.873
I don't know.
Family tradition. I guess.

554
00:37:55.248 --> 00:37:56.975
Four generations have served.

555
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.451
My dad died
in the Beirut bombings.

556
00:38:01.817 --> 00:38:03.954
Felt like something
I needed to do.

557
00:38:04.089 --> 00:38:05.522
What about you?

558
00:38:06.525 --> 00:38:08.619
Mine is. um.
it's pretty simple.

559
00:38:08.754 --> 00:38:10.228
Actually. very simple.

560
00:38:10.364 --> 00:38:12.331
But to make a
long story short...

561
00:38:13.731 --> 00:38:17.264
my daddy left my mom.
me and my little brother

562
00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:18.800
like 12 years ago.

563
00:38:18.935 --> 00:38:21.606
And my mom. she was working
two jobs back then.

564
00:38:22.476 --> 00:38:23.870
And it was horrible
to see my mom. you know.

565
00:38:24.005 --> 00:38:26.906
hustling like that.
trying to make ends meet.

566
00:38:28.241 --> 00:38:30.709
My little brother was doing
horrible in school.

567
00:38:30.845 --> 00:38:32.744
It was just all around
bad. bro.

568
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.683
But thank God
for the military.

569
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.389
You know. it really
changed our lives.

570
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:39.985
Now. my mom. she only works
40 hours a week.

571
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.256
You know. they don't
hear gunshots anymore.

572
00:38:42.392 --> 00:38:43.725
Unfortunately. I do.

573
00:38:43.861 --> 00:38:45.590
But. you know. it's a blessing
to have my family

574
00:38:45.725 --> 00:38:47.258
out of that situation.

575
00:38:47.394 --> 00:38:49.760
My little brother's following
right behind my footsteps.

576
00:38:49.896 --> 00:38:51.401
And I just got married. guys.

577
00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:54.439
So. my life is good.
I'm blessed.

578
00:38:55.273 --> 00:38:56.940
Tu. what about you?

579
00:38:57.075 --> 00:38:59.007
Well. um...

580
00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.644
My parents made it
out of Vietnam on a boat

581
00:39:02.779 --> 00:39:04.844
and they were out
on the South China Sea

582
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.977
when they were rescued
by the US Navy.

583
00:39:07.113 --> 00:39:09.620
They became
commercial fishermen.

584
00:39:09.755 --> 00:39:12.052
And they're the hardest
working people I know.

585
00:39:12.187 --> 00:39:15.388
Luckily. I had the good
fortune of going to Harvard.

586
00:39:15.524 --> 00:39:16.791
Some folks might say

587
00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:18.959
you're wasting a high
powered education.

588
00:39:19.094 --> 00:39:22.093
Yeah. But the military is
part of my master plan.

589
00:39:23.063 --> 00:39:24.668
- Master plan. huh?
- Now. listen.

590
00:39:24.803 --> 00:39:26.965
seven out of 43 presidents
have Harvard degrees.

591
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.208
31 out of 43
served in the military.

592
00:39:30.343 --> 00:39:31.941
There's a method
to my madness.

593
00:39:32.076 --> 00:39:33.203
Okay.

594
00:39:33.339 --> 00:39:35.706
My money's on the fisherman
from the bayou.

595
00:39:35.842 --> 00:39:37.908
Well. John. how about you?

596
00:39:38.043 --> 00:39:39.977
I'm from
Highland Park. Texas.

597
00:39:40.113 --> 00:39:42.180
My dad's in the oil business
up there.

598
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.423
You know.
to tell you the truth.

599
00:39:44.558 --> 00:39:46.985
he really wasn't excited
about me signing up.

600
00:39:47.121 --> 00:39:49.689
But my grandfather
was a World War II hero.

601
00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:52.190
and I admired him
my whole life.

602
00:39:52.325 --> 00:39:54.962
You can call it whatever
you want-- rich white guilt.

603
00:39:55.097 --> 00:39:57.366
But I just wasn't gonna sit
in the lap of luxury

604
00:39:57.501 --> 00:39:58.932
- my whole life.
- What?

605
00:39:59.067 --> 00:40:01.737
That sounds like
a comfortable lap to sit in.

606
00:40:02.607 --> 00:40:05.136
So. Joe.
What's your story. bro?

607
00:40:06.145 --> 00:40:07.710
I'm Lakota Sioux.

608
00:40:07.845 --> 00:40:10.812
Lakotas were great warriors
for generations.

609
00:40:10.948 --> 00:40:12.414
And at one time we were
one of the greatest

610
00:40:12.549 --> 00:40:14.178
light cavalry in the world.

611
00:40:15.953 --> 00:40:17.819
Native Americans have
the highest per capita

612
00:40:17.955 --> 00:40:21.625
military service of any
ethnic group in America.

613
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:25.096
There have been
29 Medal of Honor recipients

614
00:40:25.232 --> 00:40:26.492
from the Native Americans.

615
00:40:27.261 --> 00:40:31.800
These warrior ways.
they run deep and die hard.

616
00:40:33.368 --> 00:40:34.498
My man...

617
00:40:35.568 --> 00:40:38.235
that's like you're working
for the same institution...

618
00:40:39.378 --> 00:40:40.876
that oppressed your people.

619
00:40:41.879 --> 00:40:43.907
Yeah. some would say
the same institution

620
00:40:44.043 --> 00:40:46.012
that tried to enforce slavery.

621
00:40:47.013 --> 00:40:49.082
But history is a river. guys.

622
00:40:50.118 --> 00:40:52.755
You can't dam it up.
You can't back it up.

623
00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:55.958
We can't change the past.

624
00:40:56.093 --> 00:41:00.257
You can only alter its
downstream course. the future.

625
00:41:01.465 --> 00:41:02.994
Because an eye for an eye

626
00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:05.196
would leave this
whole world blind.

627
00:41:07.537 --> 00:41:09.640
No cross. no crown.

628
00:41:10.837 --> 00:41:13.776
No pains. no gains.

629
00:41:16.478 --> 00:41:17.978
You know. Joe...

630
00:41:19.747 --> 00:41:20.980
Always wanted a brother.

631
00:41:21.116 --> 00:41:24.787
Now I got four
from all walks of life.

632
00:41:25.823 --> 00:41:27.691
Leave it to
the US military. huh?

633
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.690
<i>De oppresso liber.</i>

634
00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:32.124
To free the oppressed.

635
00:41:33.098 --> 00:41:34.098
Whoa!

636
00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:35.399
What's up. man?

637
00:41:35.534 --> 00:41:37.201
How we doing?
Okay. boys.

638
00:41:37.336 --> 00:41:38.366
We officially made it.

639
00:41:38.502 --> 00:41:39.969
Graduation present.

640
00:41:40.104 --> 00:41:41.637
We're going off to cowboy
paradise. but here's the deal.

641
00:41:41.772 --> 00:41:43.202
I can only
adopt one of y'all.

642
00:41:43.338 --> 00:41:45.340
so there might be a fight
to death to earn that spot.

643
00:41:45.476 --> 00:41:46.743
My bets are on John.

644
00:41:48.377 --> 00:41:50.010
So Casey.

645
00:41:50.145 --> 00:41:53.183
you're telling me in the age
of the Internet.

646
00:41:53.319 --> 00:41:55.212
fast cars and airplanes.

647
00:41:55.347 --> 00:41:57.820
you are still
talking about horses?

648
00:41:59.288 --> 00:42:01.756
John. there's been five major
advances in man's ability

649
00:42:01.892 --> 00:42:03.321
to transcend
space and time. okay.

650
00:42:03.457 --> 00:42:04.959
and that has been the
domestication of the horse.

651
00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:06.595
the sailing vessel.
the steam locomotive.

652
00:42:06.731 --> 00:42:08.127
the car and the airplane.
okay?

653
00:42:08.262 --> 00:42:09.930
They all have a romantic
culture surrounding them.

654
00:42:10.065 --> 00:42:12.496
but only one has
a dynamic relationship.

655
00:42:12.632 --> 00:42:13.801
Oh. man.

656
00:42:13.937 --> 00:42:15.938
You know. relationships.
I don't know.

657
00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:17.872
You're talking about
an ignorant beast of burden.

658
00:42:18.007 --> 00:42:20.909
What exactly do you mean.
relationship?

659
00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:23.312
Okay. you can ask
millions of people.

660
00:42:23.448 --> 00:42:24.948
millions of testimonies.

661
00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:27.043
But there's a magical bond
between a man and his horse.

662
00:42:27.179 --> 00:42:28.417
Going to have to sell me. man.

663
00:42:28.552 --> 00:42:30.121
It sounds a little crazy.

664
00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:31.322
Hey. laugh all you want.

665
00:42:31.457 --> 00:42:33.018
Just telling you what it is.

666
00:42:33.154 --> 00:42:36.727
White dude speak
with unified tongue.

667
00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:39.261
Woo!

668
00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:46.698
- Cowboy land. baby.
- Woohoo!

669
00:42:46.833 --> 00:42:48.934
Hey.
Oh. wow.

670
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:50.467
All right. guys.
This is mom.

671
00:42:50.602 --> 00:42:52.604
This is grandma and grandpa.
These are the guys.

672
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.977
Nice to meet you.

673
00:42:54.113 --> 00:42:54.806
Oh. wow.

674
00:42:54.942 --> 00:42:56.846
- Cowboy.
- Oh. wow.

675
00:43:05.857 --> 00:43:08.154
Don't believe anything
she says. y'all.

676
00:43:08.289 --> 00:43:10.025
Hey. boys. Jackpot.
Bull riding tomorrow.

677
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:11.993
You ain't gotta ride
unless you're feeling froggy.

678
00:43:12.128 --> 00:43:14.964
But you're welcome to join.
Come watch. cool?

679
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.196
All right. turn in early.
You got a long day tomorrow.

680
00:43:25.107 --> 00:43:27.272
Mr. Shane. this must be
Casey's dad.

681
00:43:28.346 --> 00:43:31.047
Yep. That's him.

682
00:43:31.183 --> 00:43:35.446
He was a... he was a great.
great man. served in Vietnam

683
00:43:35.581 --> 00:43:39.723
and survived Vietnam
and died in an age of peace.

684
00:43:39.858 --> 00:43:43.588
Beirut '83.
Casey told us about it.

685
00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:44.859
Yeah.

686
00:43:44.995 --> 00:43:46.494
Very sorry for your loss.
Mr. Shane.

687
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.667
Well. I appreciate that.

688
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.697
Pain fades.
but never goes away completely.

689
00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.969
But Casey was a real blessing.
He was a clone of his dad.

690
00:43:58.105 --> 00:44:00.107
Every time I look at him. I...

691
00:44:09.316 --> 00:44:11.151
thought I was looking
at his dad.

692
00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:19.958
But... he gave me
a second shot at fatherhood.

693
00:44:20.093 --> 00:44:23.328
and it's been a great ride.

694
00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:29.708
This country
never ceases to amaze me.

695
00:44:30.902 --> 00:44:32.038
Right.

696
00:44:32.174 --> 00:44:34.672
Greatness emerges
from every corner.

697
00:44:34.807 --> 00:44:36.143
Amen.

698
00:44:42.588 --> 00:44:45.420
Good Lord. what a surprise.

699
00:44:45.556 --> 00:44:46.990
Look at you. man.

700
00:44:47.126 --> 00:44:48.626
- Still one piece. one piece.
- All grown up. man.

701
00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:50.388
- How's everything. man?
- Still alive.

702
00:44:50.523 --> 00:44:51.793
- Still breathing. kicking.
- All right.

703
00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:53.193
- Everything's good?
- Yeah.

704
00:44:53.328 --> 00:44:55.426
All right. come on in. man.
Come on in.

705
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.202
Hey. Carla. you ain't gonna
believe who's here.

706
00:44:59.337 --> 00:45:00.398
Carla.

707
00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:04.205
- Thank you.
- Thanks. hon.

708
00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:07.271
Sure is good to see you guys.
Yeah.

709
00:45:07.407 --> 00:45:10.474
How's everybody doing?
Family. parents?

710
00:45:11.543 --> 00:45:13.917
I heard Maria is still
riding in school?

711
00:45:18.918 --> 00:45:20.253
How is she?

712
00:45:25.198 --> 00:45:26.325
Fair.

713
00:45:30.735 --> 00:45:32.771
Casey. whatever happened...

714
00:45:33.935 --> 00:45:35.466
you broke her heart.

715
00:45:38.509 --> 00:45:39.976
I messed up.

716
00:45:41.743 --> 00:45:43.309
And I know that.

717
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:47.016
I'd do anything
to take it back. but I can't.

718
00:45:48.418 --> 00:45:52.956
I just hope that you two
are able to forgive me someday.

719
00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:57.026
Please. I just need
to talk to her.

720
00:46:00.026 --> 00:46:01.261
Well. Casey...

721
00:46:03.067 --> 00:46:05.936
she made me swear
I would not do that.

722
00:46:11.807 --> 00:46:13.108
Please. Juan.

723
00:46:19.484 --> 00:46:22.854
Sorry. We can't.

724
00:46:27.557 --> 00:46:28.893
Yes. sir.

725
00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:35.967
Well. I got
our guests waiting.

726
00:46:37.137 --> 00:46:39.132
It's been a long day.
I should probably head off.

727
00:46:39.268 --> 00:46:41.065
Just wanted to stop by.
say hello.

728
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.204
see how everyone's doing.

729
00:46:45.278 --> 00:46:46.306
Yeah.

730
00:46:47.912 --> 00:46:49.408
Thinking about you over there.

731
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:51.916
Praying for you.

732
00:46:53.283 --> 00:46:57.152
Come by again to have
some of those tortillas.

733
00:46:58.357 --> 00:46:59.385
Yeah.

734
00:47:14.874 --> 00:47:16.303
Could you give her
this for me?

735
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:19.306
Just tell her I love her.
please.

736
00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:22.706
I will.

737
00:47:23.943 --> 00:47:27.347
But I think she's ready
to move on without you. Casey.

738
00:47:28.483 --> 00:47:31.417
She sent all your letters
back to me unread.

739
00:47:35.526 --> 00:47:36.587
Casey...

740
00:47:38.697 --> 00:47:39.693
Take care of yourself.

741
00:47:39.828 --> 00:47:41.559
I will. Promise.

742
00:48:01.112 --> 00:48:02.679
Oh-ho-ho.

743
00:48:04.919 --> 00:48:06.617
All right. let's go. boys. come
on. wake up. wake up. wake up!

744
00:48:06.753 --> 00:48:08.957
Everybody. let's go. let's go.
come on. come on.

745
00:48:09.092 --> 00:48:10.423
Burning daylight.
here we go.

746
00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:12.222
Yeah. let's go.
Good morning. how you doing?

747
00:48:12.358 --> 00:48:13.523
Man. I'm from the hood.

748
00:48:13.659 --> 00:48:14.897
you can't be barging in
like that.

749
00:48:15.032 --> 00:48:16.096
Five minutes. Tu.
if you don't get

750
00:48:16.232 --> 00:48:17.862
that scrawny butt
of yours up. boy.

751
00:48:17.997 --> 00:48:18.998
Let's go.

752
00:48:19.134 --> 00:48:20.664
I'll meet y'all out there.

753
00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:27.638
Hustle up. boys.

754
00:48:28.547 --> 00:48:30.114
Ready. boys?

755
00:48:30.249 --> 00:48:32.545
All right. Poppy is gonna
show you how it's done.

756
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.181
You might want to listen up.
'cause I've seen you all

757
00:48:34.317 --> 00:48:36.251
try and aim
a rifle before. so...

758
00:48:37.051 --> 00:48:38.886
Good morning.

759
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:40.886
Welcome to New Mexico.

760
00:48:41.688 --> 00:48:44.561
Hold your hands up.
How many fingers you got?

761
00:48:44.697 --> 00:48:46.391
- Ten.
- Ten?

762
00:48:46.527 --> 00:48:48.191
The objective is
to come away with ten

763
00:48:48.327 --> 00:48:50.100
after you finish roping.

764
00:48:51.801 --> 00:48:53.301
Roll that wrist.

765
00:48:57.877 --> 00:48:58.975
All right.
nothing to it.

766
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.139
All you gotta do
is think it there.

767
00:49:00.275 --> 00:49:04.048
So. who wants to try it first?

768
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:18.755
All right.

769
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.560
All right.

770
00:49:22.534 --> 00:49:23.562
Oh!

771
00:49:24.569 --> 00:49:26.162
Hey!

772
00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.270
Woo-hoo-hoo.

773
00:49:40.078 --> 00:49:42.618
I just wanna shortstop
any cowboy and Indian jokes

774
00:49:42.753 --> 00:49:43.784
from you chumps.

775
00:49:57.532 --> 00:50:00.566
Maria.
We got to have a girl talk.

776
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:06.209
That sounds kind of serious.

777
00:50:08.148 --> 00:50:09.914
Maria. I've bit my tongue
for months now.

778
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:12.248
and that's not fair
or right to you.

779
00:50:13.483 --> 00:50:16.249
I'm going to read
the tea leaves for you.

780
00:50:16.384 --> 00:50:22.026
Okay.
4.0 GPA. pre-vet. check.

781
00:50:22.161 --> 00:50:25.459
Co-captain of the rodeo team.
Check.

782
00:50:25.594 --> 00:50:27.758
Unofficial New Mexico State
record holder

783
00:50:27.893 --> 00:50:30.730
for being asked out
by good-looking guys.

784
00:50:30.866 --> 00:50:34.768
but never having more than
two dates with the same guy.

785
00:50:34.903 --> 00:50:35.935
Now...

786
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:41.378
either Maria is highly
motivated and ambitious...

787
00:50:42.214 --> 00:50:46.910
and has super high
standards or...

788
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.516
Maria is running
from something.

789
00:50:53.086 --> 00:50:54.117
Maria...

790
00:50:54.787 --> 00:50:56.587
You might as well
be wearing a shirt

791
00:50:56.722 --> 00:51:00.962
that says
"Trust issues. Beware."

792
00:51:01.097 --> 00:51:02.727
Don't waste your time.

793
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.400
That obvious. huh?

794
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:07.798
Yes.

795
00:51:10.004 --> 00:51:11.241
Yes.

796
00:51:12.871 --> 00:51:15.078
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

797
00:51:15.214 --> 00:51:17.913
I feel like I can't
move forward

798
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:21.779
and... I can't go back.

799
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.584
Back to what?

800
00:51:28.691 --> 00:51:30.887
You're still in love
with Casey. aren't you?

801
00:51:33.126 --> 00:51:34.363
Maybe.

802
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:39.665
Yeah. like maybe the sun
will rise tomorrow.

803
00:51:41.836 --> 00:51:44.868
Did he ever reach out
to you after the breakup?

804
00:51:47.006 --> 00:51:50.273
Yeah. he sent
several letters to my parents.

805
00:51:50.408 --> 00:51:51.875
Did you respond?

806
00:51:54.081 --> 00:51:55.318
No.

807
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:01.687
Well. that's a creative way
to catch a guy.

808
00:52:02.723 --> 00:52:05.229
That's playing
hard to get on steroids.

809
00:52:07.326 --> 00:52:08.827
Well. I...

810
00:52:08.963 --> 00:52:11.763
I didn't think I could ever
get over the betrayal.

811
00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:17.604
And then I got to the point
where I thought

812
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.245
I'd take him back
if he crawled on broken glass.

813
00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:25.548
And then I got to
the point where I'd...

814
00:52:26.384 --> 00:52:28.419
take him back
if he just walked in.

815
00:52:29.322 --> 00:52:33.785
But... by then he was over
2.000 miles away.

816
00:52:46.504 --> 00:52:48.965
You got to send him
a smoke signal. girl.

817
00:52:51.571 --> 00:52:53.804
- Like. how?
- Like...

818
00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.346
Like. how about
the old-fashioned way?

819
00:52:57.615 --> 00:53:01.048
Write him a letter.
Express your true feelings.

820
00:53:01.184 --> 00:53:02.853
Send it snail mail.

821
00:53:02.988 --> 00:53:04.486
Spill some perfume on it.

822
00:53:06.259 --> 00:53:08.150
I don't know
if I could do that.

823
00:53:08.987 --> 00:53:10.987
I haven't talked
to him in two years.

824
00:53:12.258 --> 00:53:13.495
Hmm.

825
00:53:15.501 --> 00:53:20.997
Well. you better
figure it out. and fairly soon.

826
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.537
Or you're gonna
end up married

827
00:53:24.672 --> 00:53:26.673
to that barrel
horse of yours.

828
00:53:28.574 --> 00:53:29.873
Well. at least we know

829
00:53:30.008 --> 00:53:32.316
we wouldn't have
any trust issues there.

830
00:53:36.956 --> 00:53:38.318
Hey. you all right. Pop?

831
00:53:38.454 --> 00:53:40.589
Oh. yeah.
Yeah. I'm fine.

832
00:53:41.725 --> 00:53:43.686
You know. I think Doc
may have picked up a rock.

833
00:53:43.821 --> 00:53:45.792
Come on.
I'll check him.

834
00:53:45.927 --> 00:53:48.361
You take him on down
to the spring and loop back.

835
00:53:48.496 --> 00:53:50.066
Pick me up on the way back.

836
00:53:50.201 --> 00:53:51.769
- You sure?
- Yeah.

837
00:53:51.904 --> 00:53:52.930
I'll be all right.

838
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:08.946
♪♪

839
00:54:39.044 --> 00:54:43.079
Oh. boy. lookie here.
Lookie here.

840
00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.491
That's a "Bonanza" shot
if ever there was one.

841
00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.700
Warrior spirit still lives.

842
00:55:16.115 --> 00:55:17.682
All right. so tell me what
you guys think?

843
00:55:17.818 --> 00:55:20.319
- Beautiful.
- Unbelievable.

844
00:55:20.454 --> 00:55:21.986
Man. it's amazing.

845
00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:25.924
Tell you what.
you come out here...

846
00:55:27.297 --> 00:55:28.894
imagination runs wild.

847
00:55:29.694 --> 00:55:31.369
Dreams come true.

848
00:55:32.632 --> 00:55:34.130
Worries don't even exist.

849
00:55:35.133 --> 00:55:39.641
I'll tell you what.
I'm a believer.

850
00:55:41.543 --> 00:55:43.313
I'm definitely a believer.

851
00:55:43.448 --> 00:55:45.446
I wouldn't have
never dreamed it.

852
00:55:45.581 --> 00:55:47.880
But I'm here
and I can see it.

853
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.751
When I get out
of the Army. bro.

854
00:55:50.886 --> 00:55:52.952
I'm gonna come kick it
with you. for sure.

855
00:55:53.088 --> 00:55:54.484
And you know I'm gonna take you
up on that. right.

856
00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:56.121
put you to work?

857
00:55:56.257 --> 00:55:58.722
Hey. man. just keep me out
of that truck. and we good.

858
00:55:58.857 --> 00:56:00.630
Hey. you come back any time.

859
00:56:01.533 --> 00:56:03.526
Reclaim the ancestor's
legacy. huh?

860
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:04.963
Thank you.

861
00:56:26.885 --> 00:56:28.822
We saw Casey last week.

862
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:34.058
He came to the ranch with
some of his soldier fellows.

863
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:39.166
How was he?

864
00:56:39.935 --> 00:56:43.406
I'd say he was good
and that he looked great.

865
00:56:43.542 --> 00:56:46.242
He must have gained
ten or 15 pounds.

866
00:56:46.377 --> 00:56:47.674
- and all muscle.
- Muscle.

867
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.538
I'd hate to tangle
with the guy.

868
00:56:49.674 --> 00:56:54.118
And he's got some great men
in his special operations unit.

869
00:56:54.253 --> 00:56:55.849
- Mm-hmm.
- And I tell you.

870
00:56:55.984 --> 00:56:59.215
those guys make me feel good
about America.

871
00:57:00.719 --> 00:57:02.091
What was the bad?

872
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:07.127
Well. Casey came to see
your mother and me in private.

873
00:57:07.896 --> 00:57:09.796
Never seen lover's remorse
like that.

874
00:57:09.932 --> 00:57:12.531
- Mm.
- And I got to tell you. Maria.

875
00:57:12.666 --> 00:57:14.371
I think this guy Casey

876
00:57:14.507 --> 00:57:16.474
loves you more than
he ever has.

877
00:57:19.737 --> 00:57:21.774
He fessed up

878
00:57:21.909 --> 00:57:24.581
that the breakup
was all his fault.

879
00:57:25.782 --> 00:57:28.411
He expressed
his undying love for you.

880
00:57:29.314 --> 00:57:31.951
And he said he was gonna
come back for you.

881
00:57:33.426 --> 00:57:34.688
So. you better be
thinking about

882
00:57:34.824 --> 00:57:36.758
what you're going to say
when he shows up.

883
00:57:37.761 --> 00:57:39.827
I don't know
if I can go back there.

884
00:57:42.132 --> 00:57:43.160
Maria...

885
00:57:44.262 --> 00:57:47.701
most young men
have to Fool's Hills

886
00:57:47.837 --> 00:57:49.939
once or twice
before they grow up.

887
00:57:50.942 --> 00:57:55.040
And the Lord knows I was
captain of the Fool's Brigade.

888
00:57:59.384 --> 00:58:01.046
If there's no forgiveness...

889
00:58:02.414 --> 00:58:04.885
there wouldn't be many men
standing in the end.

890

Mama. what did you think?

891
00:58:11.297 --> 00:58:13.694
I saw a heartbroken man

892
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.127
deeply in love
with our daughter.

893
00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:22.368
Would you trust him?

894
00:58:22.504 --> 00:58:24.168
With my life.

895
00:58:26.708 --> 00:58:28.304
So. what are you thinking?

896
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:31.847
Daddy. don't push me.

897
00:58:31.982 --> 00:58:35.278
The heart has reasons
the mind knows nothing of.

898
00:58:36.784 --> 00:58:38.248
- Fair enough.
- Mm-hmm.

899
00:58:39.322 --> 00:58:40.558
Fair enough.

900
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:46.597

to give you this.

901

Dear Maria.

902
00:58:55.633 --> 00:58:58.500
shame and grief have haunted
me since my stupidity.

903
00:58:58.636 --> 00:59:02.240

the chasm in our relationship.

904
00:59:03.143 --> 00:59:05.343
I think about you
a hundred times a day.

905

I would understand
if you choose to move on.

906

a glimmer of chance

that I'm a changed man.

the pieces of our mutual life

914

915

to get together

that he should be born blind?"

1213

call the mystery of evil.

1218
01:30:17.447 --> 01:30:21.083
Pop... did you fight
in the war like my daddy?

1219
01:30:22.152 --> 01:30:24.460
Yeah. it was
called World War II.

1220
01:30:25.327 --> 01:30:27.023
We fought a great evil...

1221
01:30:28.262 --> 01:30:29.729
and we won.

1222
01:30:30.928 --> 01:30:33.194
Many good men did not return.

1223
01:30:35.099 --> 01:30:37.337
Casey. you need to always
be thankful.

1224
01:30:37.473 --> 01:30:39.074
Thankful
for the sacrifices

1225
01:30:39.209 --> 01:30:40.773
others have made for you.

1226
01:30:59.259 --> 01:31:00.496
Morning.

1227
01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.264
Where are you headed?

1228
01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:12.871
Gonna go see Maria.

1229
01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.138
Does she know you're coming?

1230
01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:18.778
No.

1231
01:31:21.013 --> 01:31:22.376
Don't you think
you should give her

1232
01:31:22.511 --> 01:31:24.850
a little prior notice
before just showing up?

1233
01:31:25.684 --> 01:31:27.050
See you when I'm back.

1234
01:31:51.444 --> 01:31:52.845
Hey. Maria.

1235
01:31:54.547 --> 01:31:55.947
Hello. Casey.

1236
01:32:02.791 --> 01:32:04.890
Was hoping we could
talk for a bit.

1237
01:32:18.605 --> 01:32:20.202
I'm sorry for what I did.

1238
01:32:23.906 --> 01:32:25.240
I forgive you.

1239
01:32:26.881 --> 01:32:28.077
Leaving in the middle
of the night

1240
01:32:28.212 --> 01:32:29.550
without telling me
where you're going

1241
01:32:29.686 --> 01:32:30.848
and not responding
to my letters

1242
01:32:30.984 --> 01:32:32.683
sure didn't
feel like forgiveness.

1243
01:32:32.818 --> 01:32:34.388
You ignored my letter. too.

1244
01:32:34.523 --> 01:32:36.116
Never got a letter from you.

1245
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:37.725
Well. I sent one
eight months ago.

1246
01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:39.859
and I never heard anything
back from you.

1247
01:32:44.866 --> 01:32:46.967
You know. forgiveness
is one thing.

1248
01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:49.199
But growing up
with another person

1249
01:32:49.335 --> 01:32:51.937
in a committed love
relationship for a lifetime...

1250
01:32:52.903 --> 01:32:54.368
that's even bigger.

1251
01:32:56.644 --> 01:32:58.614
Ideals are prickly things.

1252
01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.144
Without them. life
isn't worth much. and...

1253
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:07.755
with them can come
disappointment.

1254
01:33:09.024 --> 01:33:11.226
I grew up believing
that cowboys were tried

1255
01:33:11.361 --> 01:33:14.293
and true to their word

1256
01:33:14.429 --> 01:33:15.862
and their people.

1257
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:19.767
And especially their women.

1258
01:33:22.201 --> 01:33:25.674
I can fix it.
We can put it back together.

1259
01:33:28.544 --> 01:33:32.945
What we had was so special.

1260
01:33:36.582 --> 01:33:37.917
So unique.

1261
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:42.691
I thought it was a one
in a million kind of thing.

1262
01:33:45.857 --> 01:33:47.691
I thought it was sacred.

1263
01:33:47.826 --> 01:33:51.029
But... you trashed it.

1264
01:33:53.937 --> 01:33:57.371
And if you would trash it
in the best of times.

1265
01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:59.001
how could I ever trust you

1266
01:33:59.136 --> 01:34:01.138
to be there when
the days go dark?

1267
01:34:02.344 --> 01:34:05.044
I... cannot.

1268
01:34:05.179 --> 01:34:08.783
And I will not live
with a man I cannot trust.

1269
01:34:12.455 --> 01:34:14.217
Some awfully hard words.

1270
01:34:16.823 --> 01:34:18.489
Sometimes life is hard.

1271
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:22.357
Sometimes we make them hard
by our own actions.

1272
01:34:22.492 --> 01:34:24.964
Doesn't that tried and true
go both ways?

1273
01:34:27.702 --> 01:34:29.201
I'm in a bad place. Maria.

1274
01:34:29.337 --> 01:34:32.970
I thought my oldest and
best friend could help me out.

1275
01:34:33.106 --> 01:34:35.403
I know you're in
a bad place. Casey.

1276
01:34:37.312 --> 01:34:40.107
And that something bad must
have happened in Afghanistan.

1277
01:34:40.243 --> 01:34:42.077
But we have too much history.

1278
01:34:42.213 --> 01:34:45.413
We're too
emotionally entangled.

1279
01:34:45.548 --> 01:34:47.982
And I'm trying to rebuild
my shattered dreams

1280
01:34:48.118 --> 01:34:50.055
and find a way forward.

1281
01:34:51.158 --> 01:34:53.124
And with God's help.
I'm gonna make it.

1282
01:34:58.765 --> 01:35:00.164
I know you're suffering.

1283
01:35:02.204 --> 01:35:05.972
And I want the Lord to heal you
and to restore you.

1284
01:35:10.178 --> 01:35:12.506
You have no idea what
happened to me over there.

1285
01:35:16.145 --> 01:35:18.052
You just throw me out?

1286
01:35:18.188 --> 01:35:21.922
And then you have the nerve
to preach to me about God.

1287
01:35:22.057 --> 01:35:25.992
- you selfish. sanctimonious--
- That's it.

1288
01:35:26.825 --> 01:35:29.292
Get out. Leave!

1289
01:35:31.362 --> 01:35:35.100
You have crushed
every dream I ever had.

1290
01:35:37.933 --> 01:35:43.438
Don't ever come see me again
unless God has changed you.

1291
01:35:47.312 --> 01:35:49.411
I can't go through
another crushing.

1292
01:35:51.848 --> 01:35:53.217
Sorry.

And when it does.

1328
01:39:22.627 --> 01:39:24.863
there's only one architect

1330
01:39:27.331 --> 01:39:29.532

I don't believe that. Case.

1335

We were ambushed
by about 50 Taliban.

Went down the mountain.
Alamoed in an abandoned house.

Two wounded.
but we were fighting.

Called in CAS and evac.

1339
01:40:17.652 --> 01:40:20.649

the middle of the firefight.

1340
01:40:24.321 --> 01:40:26.127
So I went and got her.

1341
01:40:27.862 --> 01:40:29.262
Brought her back.

1342
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:37.468
She was wired with explosives
and blew us all up.

If it wasn't for me.
my men would still be alive.

That was heroism
in its purest form.

1348
01:41:07.003 --> 01:41:10.501
That was
self-sacrificing love.

No. Pop.

I can't even tell them
what happened.

01:41:26.888 --> 01:41:28.189
Can't face 'em.

1361
01:41:51.275 --> 01:41:52.840
The cowboy way.

but I... betrayed her.

1365
01:42:07.323 --> 01:42:08.691
Broke her trust.

1366
01:42:10.664 --> 01:42:12.827
She told me she never
wanted to see me again.

1367
01:42:15.364 --> 01:42:16.765
Case...

1368
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:19.405

1369
01:42:25.015 --> 01:42:28.843

planned for you.

1372

the eyes of his heart.

pieces of his soul.

give him the courage
