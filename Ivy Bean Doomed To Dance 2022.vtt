3
00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:40.517
Bean!

4
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.020
Where are you?

5
00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.106
You have to see this!

6
00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.441
I'm in the tree house. Ivy!

7
00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.151
Ghosts and swords. Bean!

8
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.694
And an evil duke!

9
00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:57.742
Hmm?

10
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.417
Giselle falls in love with a duke.

11
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.255
who likes her. but really.
he's gonna marry a princess.

12
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.632
So Giselle dies of a broken heart.

13
00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.219
Ow. my heart. I'm dead now.

14
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.721
Her ghost goes into the forest

15
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.142
and meets these other ghosts
with broken hearts called the Wilis.

16
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.144
You're mean. evil duke.

17
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:29.816
And they all surround the duke
and dance him… to death.

18
00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.152
-Taste my arabesque!

19
00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.195
I wanna be Giselle!

20
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.282
Oh. Okay. You be Giselle first.

21
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.201
Uh… You can be one of the Wilis.

22
00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.580
With extremely long fingernails.

23
00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.500
No. we need an evil duke.
so you can kick his head off.

24
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.836
But watch out. I…

25
00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.255
…have a sword.

26
00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.553
Get away from me. Giselle ghost!

27
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.182
What that girl comes up with.

28
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.976
Typical Saturday Bean.

29
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.395
What is she supposed to be?

30
00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:09.397
-A superhero or something?
-I…

31
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.566
-A-ha. evil duke!

32
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.193
My Wilis will get you!

33
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.736
More like a super-zero.

34
00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.447
Your dancing is too strong for me.

35
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.365
Nancy…

36
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.411
Get him. Wilis.

37
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.830
Dance him to death.

38
00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.466
Keep back. or I'll sword you.

39
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.718
I'll chop off your spinning little legs!

40
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:42.847
Dance you to death!
Dance you to death! Dance you to death!

41
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.142
-Dance you to death! Dance you to death!

42
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.354
-Dance you to death! Dance you to death!

43
00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.572
Now comes the part
where I kick off your head!

44
00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:06.663
Hey. Are you guys playing Wiffle ball?

45
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.039
Can I be pitcher?

46
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.667
Leo! Great.

47
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.921
You can be the duke.
and Ivy and I can both be Giselles.

48
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:17.507
Giselles? What's that?

49
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.591
It's a ballet.

50
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:19.968
Is there a uniform?

51
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.969
There are tights.

52
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.431
-See ya.
-Don't be silly. Leo.

53
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.434
It's jumping and kicking
as high as your head!

54
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:35.483
Poor Leo. He doesn't know that ballet
is about dancing your enemies to death.

55
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.819
-Yeah!
-Yah!

56
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.240
Bean. what if we learned
how to actually do ballet?

57
00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.158
For real.

58
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.247
Grandma sent you this?

59
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.541
Aw. she was always trying
to get me to dance.

60
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.877
-You didn't want to?
-I have two left feet and zero rhythm.

61
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.297
But this is a great time for you
to explore things

62
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.466
that catch your interest.
so ballet lessons it is.

63
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.553
-Yes!
-That was so easy.

64
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:05.596
You just have to ask your mom.

65
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.350
And now that your mom has said yes.
my mom has to. too.

66
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.186
Absolutely not.

67
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.355
But ballet's my destiny.

68
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.445
Enough. Nancy. Pick up the bread. please.

69
00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.613
Since when is ballet your destiny?

70
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.614
Since today.

71
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.408
The best part is kicking off heads.

72
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.659
Watch this.

73
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.287
-Whoa. whoa. whoa! Careful. twinkle toes.
-Ugh!

74
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.457
Bean. we're not spending money
on something you'll quit in two weeks.

75
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.709
But I have to take lessons. Mom.

76
00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:37.754
This is a great time
to explore things that catch my interest.

77
00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.800
Didn't you tell me
you had to take gymnastics?

78
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.597
And had to learn trumpet?

79
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.142
And had to play softball.

80
00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.102
Catch it. Bean!

81
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:56.898
You quit them all.

82
00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.901
I won't quit ballet.

83
00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.737
I <i>love</i> ballet.

84
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.656
Of course. you'll quit.
I bet you $5 you'll quit.

85
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.241
Deal. Double deal.

86
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.410
Ten dollars. I won't quit. ever.

87
00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.870
Yes. you will.

88
00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.915
You won't even last
learning all five positions.

89
00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:15.249
I barely did.

90
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.588
Hang on. You let Nancy take ballet.

91
00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:21.506
That's not fair.

92
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.674
-That means you love her more than me.
-Yeah.

93
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.511
-Love has nothing to do with it.
-Please…

94
00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.892
Let her do it.

95
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.811
I need the money.

96
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.275
-Okay. Bean. you can take ballet.

97
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.694
-Yay. yay. yay. yay. yay. yay!
-Wait!

98
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:45.905
On one condition.

99
00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.740
Anything. You name it. Mom.

100
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.617
You may not quit.

101
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.661
You have to stick it out
for the full term.

102
00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.914
All the lessons.
No quitting and no complaining.

103
00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:58.292
I promise. Mom. on an oath of spit.

104
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.172
Your promise is good enough.
Go wash your hands.

105
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.258
-Uh… Twice.

106
00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:06.217
Yes!

107
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.678
-Really?

108
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.597
Ballet? Well. it's better than tap.

109
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:15.435
Bonjour. bonjour. bonjour.
bonjour. bonjour! <i>Bienvenue.</i>

110
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.646
Welcome to The Joyful School of Ballet.

111
00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.524
Seeing all your shining faces
makes me smile.

112
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.861
I am not only your instructor.

113
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.989
but I am also a fellow dancer myself.

114
00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:35.371
And why. you might ask. do I dance?

115
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:39.292
-When I dance. my body and soul soars!

116
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:48.509
I am your teacher.
your <i>maître de ballet</i>. Mr. Joy.

117
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:52.638
But here. you will call me Monsieur Joie.

118
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.600
That is how my name
is pronounced in <i>la belle française.</i>

119
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.435
The birthplace of ballet.

120
00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:01.856
So here. I am Monsieur Joie. <i>c'est moi.</i>

121
00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:04.984
-Monsieur Ju-ah?
-Joy. Joy means "Joie."

122
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.986
-Joie?
-Joie. Just watch my mouth.

123
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.280
Ju-Ju-Ju-Joie.

124
00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:10.656
-Joie.
-Ja?

125
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.533
-Joie!
-Like "wah-wah."

126
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:13.493
-Jo…
-Ju-wah?

127
00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.203
Joie. Joie.

128
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:17.788
Just do your best.

129
00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.624
Yes. Monsieur Joie!

130
00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:21.834
Now. when I call your name.

131
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.045
please raise your hand.

132
00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:26.714
Eric?

133
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.177
Eric?

134
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.512
What?

135
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:34.680
Eric?

136
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:38.267
Emma?

137
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.435
-Hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

138
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.686
Zuzu?

139
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.397
<i>Je m'appelle Zuzu. </i>Monsieur Joie.

140
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.192
<i>Je suis très </i>impressed.

141
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:49.737
<i>Bonne.</i>

142
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.143
-Who are you?
-We're in your class. Ivy and Bean.

143
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.480
Wha-wha-wha-wha…
What are… What are you wearing?

144
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.316
It's an evil duke costume.

145
00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:29.819
-For <i>Giselle.</i>

146
00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.529
It hurts my eyeballs.

147
00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:34.365
Uh. please change now. mademoiselles.

148
00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.701
This is a ballet class. not a circus camp.

149
00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:40.871
<i>Maman.</i> please.

150
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:49.005
-Melanie.

151
00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.673
Excellent. Monsieur Eric.

152
00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:54.468
You are almost like a young me. Hmm.

153
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.847
Almost.

154
00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:00.850
How are you so good?

155
00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.060
-You're so clumsy.
-I don't know.

156
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.940
-Grand battement. plié.

157
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.110
Good.

158
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:13.613
Beaucoup. beaucoup. beaucoup. Wonderful.

159
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:16.782
Monsieur Joie. can I ask you a question?

160
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.911
-Yes.
-When do we start kicking heads off?

161
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.955
When do we do the fun ballet?

162
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.667
What is the… "fun ballet"?

163
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.795
Like in <i>Giselle.</i> Sword fights.
broken-hearted killer ghosts.

164
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.964
Oh. that fun ballet.

165
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:35.301
Hmm.<i> Peut-être </i>after you learn the basics.

166
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.054
-I'd say four or five minute--

167
00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.472
Years!

168
00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.808
-Years?

169
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.482
All together now.

170
00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:54.278
Tendu. grand battement.
grand battement. plié.

171
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.196
Again!

172
00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.908
Tendu. grand battement.
grand battement. plié--

173
00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.494
Ah! Ah! Oh. wow. What… What is this?

174
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:04.538
My mom says that I should dance
like no one's watching.

175
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:09.293
Yes. well. I can understand
why she'd tell you that.

176
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:13.422
On… the… beat. mademoiselle!

177
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.092
On the beat!

178
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.139
Here. I'll show her. Monsieur Joie.
Like this. Ivy.

179
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.611
No. No.
No. no. no. no. no. no. No!

180
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.113
-Without the music.

181
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.785
Okay. imagine… you are a gazelle.

182
00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.371
Giselle? With the duke and ghostly Wilis?

183
00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:46.372
No! No!

184
00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:48.374
Gazelle. the animal.

185
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:54.088
Racing across the African plains.
gracefully extending your limbs.

186
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:56.257
-Whoa!

187
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.509
-Okay.

188
00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:00.761
-Okay!

189
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:04.515
All right. all right! We're gonna forget
the gazelle. and we're going to march.

190
00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:06.851
-March. Knees up and march.

191
00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:10.521
Not you. You are ballet students.

192
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:14.275
Just Ivy's marching. and apparently Bean.

193
00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:24.827
I was the worst.

194
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.413
Everyone laughed. I never want to go back.

195
00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.165
Me neither.

196
00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:31.667
Ballet is not our destiny. Ivy.

197
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.127
It is our despair.

198
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.881
Mom. 13 is so far away.

199
00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.466
It's not that far away.

200
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.551
Nancy. could you
just slow down a little bit?

201
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:41.802
I'm in seventh grade.

202
00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:43.512
Seventh. Mom.

203
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.931
We're converting fractions to decimals.

204
00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:48.684
We're studying puberty.
Sixth graders aren't doing that.

205
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.146
Fourth graders aren't. but there
are plenty of them who have earrings.

206
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:53.814
Nancy. please.

207
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.858
Hi. girls. How was ballet?

208
00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:57.777
You gonna quit?

209
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.986
It was great.

210
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.697
-Yes. so much fun.

211
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.745
-Hi. Charlotte!
-Impossible. No way. You hated it.

212
00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:10.581
I bet Monsieur Joie ate you alive.

213
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:12.666
Nope. We loved it.

214
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.210
He loved us.

215
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:17.004
The word "gazelle" was used.

216
00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:19.298
We are the stars of the class.

217
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.550
Let's change the bet.

218
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.177
Double or nothing.

219
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.265
Twenty dollars that says no way are you
two dorks ever gonna be the stars.

220
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.894
-Girls!
-Prepare to be totally broke.

221
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.438
Actually. I'm preparing to be rich.

222
00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.440
Twenty dollars is mine.

223
00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:40.194
-Nancy. please. This car is not a casino.

224
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.448
What are you boys up to?

225
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.908
We just ran a marathon.

226
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.409
Our third this year.

227
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.418
This is our only hope.

228
00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:00.089
A spell won't help.
I had to promise I wouldn't quit.

229
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:03.926
Listen to this. Forgetfulness spell.

230
00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:08.347
-Turn back time and erase the past.

231
00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.516
If we do this right.

232
00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:13.310
they won't even remember
we talked about ballet

233
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:14.895
or that they paid for it.

234
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:19.233
Bean. do you want
to take capoeira lessons?

235
00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:23.904
It's been so long since you've taken
any kind of lessons. anywhere.

236
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:25.865
Perfect!

237
00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:29.159
Mom will forget my promise.
and Nancy will forget the bet.

238
00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.369
What do we need?

239
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:34.415
First up… ten dead flies.

240
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.959
Thank you so much.

241
00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:40.045
My pleasure. My pleasure.
You know. I remember…

242
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:49.263
…raisins and sweet potato pie.
That's like a family tradition…

243
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.180
Ready?

244
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.267
Oh. no!

245
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.770
I'm like. "How you gonna make it fluffy?"
How is it even gonna be thick?

246
00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.355
If you're gonna put almond--

247
00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.356
Ow!

248
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.234
I think ballet broke my knee bone. Mom.

249
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.320
-Oh.
-It's all purple.

250
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.364
-Did you paint your knee?
-No.

251
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:13.871
Rose and nettle. flies and leaf.
erase the past. relieve our grief!

252
00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:15.372
-Ooh!

253
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:17.833
Ivy!

254
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.877
Are you throwing flies at me?

255
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.338
Do you remember what day it is?

256
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:28.177
Yes. It is the day that you threw dead
insects and leaf bits into our dinner.

257
00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:33.432
Can you tell me the name
of your favorite anthropologist?

258
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:36.226
Can you tell me the name
of what we're gonna eat now?

259
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.395
-Um…

260
00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.857
Do you remember a promise

261
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.277
I made a <i>long</i> time ago?

262
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.612
<i>Last </i>week?

263
00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:49.531
When you agreed to stick with ballet?

264
00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.117
Dang. Some spell.

265
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:54.745
Shh.

266
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:58.415
Did you put a spell on us?

267
00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.042
Uh…

268
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.001
Why?

269
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.503
Hmm…

270
00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.130
Because we want to quit ballet.

271
00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:06.757
It was awful.

272
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.883
Mmm-hmm.

273
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:08.884
I was awful.

274
00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:12.388
I thought it'd be fun.
but everyone laughed.

275
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.098
Honey.

276
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.309
You don't have to take ballet.

277
00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:21.313
If it's not for you. just… just stop.

278
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:23.732
You're not mad?

279
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.651
No. of course not.

280
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:28.445
I want you to explore things.

281
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:31.824
so you can find out what you are
and aren't passionate about.

282
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.492
Hmm. You did discover something.

283
00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:36.120
You discovered that ballet wasn't for you.

284
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.122
Come here.

285
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.458
Hmm?

286
00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:43.752
Don't even think about it.

287
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.715
Mom. you're so unfair.
Ivy's mom let her quit.

288
00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:49.550
Well. I'm not Ivy's mom.

289
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.593
Moms are different
just the way kids are different.

290
00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.345
But I'm not different from Ivy.

291
00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:56.890
I also discovered ballet isn't for me.
so how come I can't quit?

292
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.309
Aside from the fact
that you made a promise?

293
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.979
Because I want you to learn
how to stick with something. Bean.

294
00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:03.772
Ballet is hard.

295
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:07.317
But if you work at it and persevere.
you might discover you're good at it.

296
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:10.571
Or die of boredom. It happens. you know.

297
00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:12.239
Or learn to like it.

298
00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:14.241
Either way. I think you'll survive.

299
00:17:14.324 --> 00:17:16.368
-You may even thank me.

300
00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:21.165
Come on. Now. go take a bath.

301
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.500
No. you made me take a bath yesterday.

302
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:31.133
Bean. straight to bed.
Lights out in ten minutes.

303
00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.490
-<i> Wanda Rich reporting for duty.</i>

304
00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.075
<i>What's your 20. Grizzly Girl?</i>

305
00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.827
-<i> Grizzly Girl? Are you there?</i>

306
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.245
Bean!

307
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:02.790
-Bean?
-<i>I'm here.</i>

308
00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:04.666
In a not good mood.

309
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:06.627
My life is ruined.

310
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.545
She really won't let you quit?

311
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.090
Nope. I even tried to cry.

312
00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:13.675
She just told me to stop drooling.

313
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.052
This is bad.

314
00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:21.642
If you have to do ballet.
I think I have to do it too.

315
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:23.352
No. you don't.

316
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.604
I was the one who got you into this.

317
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.439
It was all my idea.

318
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.899
Are you sure?

319
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:32.236
What if you fall. like. a hundred times?

320
00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:33.737
I won't quit.

321
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:37.449
What if you twirl so much
your toes bleed in your ballet shoes

322
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:41.078
and get scabs that fall off
and bleed even more?

323
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:42.996
I still won't quit.

324
00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:46.333
What if kids laugh at you?

325
00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:50.838
I'll have to endure.

326
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.552
I guess we're doomed. Ivy.

327
00:18:57.344 --> 00:18:58.512
You and me.

328
00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.514
Doomed to dance.

329
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.524
Group <i>un.</i>

330
00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:13.527
Very good.

331
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.820
Group <i>deux.</i>

332
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.030
Ah. <i>bonne.</i>

333
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.324
Group <i>trois.</i>

334
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:23.704
Group Ivy and Bean.

335
00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.456
-Ah!

336
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.001
-Oh. no. No. no. no.

337
00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:30.502
-Oh.

338
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.881
-Oh. mademoiselles.

339
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.929
Oh.

340
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:43.473
-Ah!

341
00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.018
Lovely. Zuzu.

342
00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.478
-Remember. we are what?

343
00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.189
Gazelles!

344
00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:55.194
-Yeah!

345
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.112
-Oh.

346
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.655
-Whoa!

347
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:11.001
All right. <i>mes enfants.</i>
Settle down. Settle down.

348
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:13.128
-Marvelous news.

349
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.922
This year. for the first time.

350
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.883
we are not doing a little recital
here in the studio.

351
00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:22.054
Instead. we are taking part
in A Festival of Movement.

352
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:25.682
A Dance Delirium in 26 Acts.

353
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:30.979
Which is why I have chosen something
<i>très </i>unique for this performance.

354
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:35.025
Something with magic and suspense.

355
00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:40.239
For this is a story
of two magical creatures who fall in love.

356
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.157
A mermaid…

357
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.535
-Zuzu.
-Yes!

358
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:49.039
-Yes!
-And a seahorse. Eric.

359
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:53.210
It is called <i>Wedding Beneath the Sea.</i>

360
00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:57.256
-Eric?
-There's not any kissy stuff. is there?

361
00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:58.924
No. No. no. no. no.

362
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:00.759
Well. <i>oui. oui.</i>

363
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:02.052
No. No. no. no. no.

364
00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:06.056
Your… Your… Your emotions are expressed
through the artistry of dance.

365
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:10.519
-Say it with me. When I dance…
-My body and soul soars?

366
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.855
My body and soul soars. Yes. Zuzu. <i>Merci.</i>

367
00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.775
Emma. you are a tropical fish
who marries them.

368
00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:17.693
-Oh. yes.
-Oh my!

369
00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.362
The rest of you are wedding guests.
You bring presents.

370
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.363
You dance.

371
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.282
-You tra-la-la.

372
00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:25.951
Monsieur Joie?

373
00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:28.537
What do Bean and I do?

374
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.831
Yes. you two.

375
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.252
You'll be delighted to know I have
taken on the choreographic challenge.

376
00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:37.379
I have taken your erratic…

377
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:40.299
What would you even call… Movements.

378
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.426
And transmuted them into art.

379
00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:45.304
-You will be friendly squid.

380
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:46.430
Standing guard

381
00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:52.728
at the very. very. very. very. very. very.
very. very. very. very edge of the stage.

382
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.565
Like so. your tentacles waving
on the passing tide.

383
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.359
ensuring the success of the wedding.

384
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.612
-Friendly squid?
-They're just happy to be there.

385
00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.282
The invitation
strictly said no babies and no squid.

386
00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:09.661
Oh! Best of all.
this year's performance takes place at…

387
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:13.123
-The Burroughs Theater.

388
00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:17.210
Which seats 300 people.

389
00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:27.429
It's not that I want
to be like everyone else.

390
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.681
It's just… Earrings are fun. Mom.

391
00:22:30.807 --> 00:22:32.768
-They feel like me.

392
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.521
I said the same thing
to your grandma when I was your age.

393
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.148
I wanted to dye my hair green.

394
00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:40.859
Green?

395
00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:42.319
Yeah.

396
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.030
Did she let you?

397
00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:47.699
No.

398
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.868
No. she did not.

399
00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:59.169
-Ivy? Bean?

400
00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.379
What's the matter?

401
00:23:01.254 --> 00:23:02.589
Nothing.

402
00:23:02.672 --> 00:23:04.549
Oh. honey. You sure?

403
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:07.010
You look like you actually hurt
your knee bone this time.

404
00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:09.012
-Bonjour. Madame.

405
00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:11.473
-Can we just go. please?
-Bonjour. Madame.

406
00:23:11.973 --> 00:23:12.808
Nancy.

407
00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.518
Hi. Harold.

408
00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:16.103
It's "Monsieur Joie."

409
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.397
-Monsieur Joie.
-Ah.

410
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.275
-How are these two doing?
-We… Oh. yes… They're…. They're. um…

411
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:26.780
I've never had budding little dancers
who are… who are quite so…

412
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.532
Uh. um…

413
00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:32.327
You know. I don't think
that there's a word for it in French.

414
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.122
-And they forgot their announcements.

415
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.706
-The big recital.

416
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.041
-Au revoir!

417
00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:41.461
Bye. Harold.

418
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.507
A recital will be great.

419
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.300
I bet you have fun parts.

420
00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:52.013
Yeah. Fun parts
as the stars of the show. right?

421
00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:53.557
That's right. Nancy.

422
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.517
-We're in every scene.
-Really?

423
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.727
You got
some new dancers this year.

424
00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:03.608
You're the two friendly squid?

425
00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:07.070
That is so embarrassing.

426
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:11.116
Nancy. could you be nice
to your sister. just once?

427
00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:12.409
I am nice.

428
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:18.123
I cannot wait to see Bean
as the friendly squid.

429
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:25.213
No one's gonna laugh. Bean.
Everybody is going to be very proud.

430
00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.007
-Buckle up.

431
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.526
Eric. honey. you were supposed
to paint the fish. not yourself.

432
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.444
Sorry.

433
00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:48.737
Okay. Ten more minutes. class.

434
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.572
then we'll hang
your fish prints on the wall.

435
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:54.075
Please get these permission slips signed
by your parents as soon as possible.

436
00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.244
otherwise you won't be able to go
on the field trip.

437
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:57.746
-What's so funny?

438
00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:00.957
Nothing. just your fish printing.

439
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:05.378
Zuzu said you guys are gonna be
like this fish at your recital.

440
00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:07.839
A flop.

441
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:12.052
Why do you care? You're not even coming.

442
00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:14.304
I'm coming with my sister.

443
00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:16.181
We both love ballet.

444
00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:18.808
Who else is going to the dance festival?

445
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.851
I am. Paisley.

446
00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:21.811
Dance festival?

447
00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:23.980
I didn't know you can dance. Ivy.

448
00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:26.107
No way.

449
00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.025
Don't worry.

450
00:25:27.108 --> 00:25:29.027
They're coming to watch dancing.

451
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.986
Not wiggling.

452
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.448
And definitely not wiggling.
friendly squid.

453
00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:37.536
I might be there
for the wiggling. friendly squid.

454
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.997
What exactly is a squid?
It has ink. right?

455
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:43.208
-And weird tentacle arms.

456
00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:44.209
Leo.

457
00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:47.796
Okay. class. who wants the horseshoe crab?
-I do! I do!

458
00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.340
It's an arthropod. a living fossil.

459
00:25:50.423 --> 00:25:52.425
-Yeah?
-Thanks. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

460
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:55.303
And then there's this little invertebrate.
A squid!

461
00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:57.847
All yours. Dusit.

462
00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:01.101
I'm doing ballet. I'm so silly.

463
00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:03.019
I'm Ivy and Bean.

464
00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:12.571
That was just the beginning. Bean.

465
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:15.198
The whole school will be laughing at us.

466
00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:18.994
Nancy. too. She'll see
we're not the stars of the show.

467
00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.912
and she'll get $20.

468
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.748
I'll have to do chores forever
to pay that.

469
00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:26.042
There has to be some way out of this.

470
00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:27.794
Nothing's impossible.

471
00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:30.714
Being good at ballet is impossible.

472
00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:32.132
Yeah.

473
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.888
But it wouldn't be impossible
to break our legs.

474
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:40.765
Huh?

475
00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.644
Ivy. we shouldn't do this.

476
00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:46.062
Mm-mm.

477
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.606
Mm-mm.

478
00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:51.109
You know. when Eric broke his arm.

479
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.694
the first time.

480
00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:56.072
you could almost see
his bone sticking out.

481
00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:59.409
-Maybe breaking is a very bad idea.
-Mmm-hmm.

482
00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:01.703
How about

483
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:03.705
spraining?

484
00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:09.628
Au revoir. recital!

485
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:11.755
Toodle-oo tentacles!

486
00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.466
-Whoa!

487
00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.555
This is a bad idea!

488
00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:25.143
Probably just a bruise would work.

489
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.980
Mmm-hmm.

490
00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:31.274
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:34.736
-Huh?
-We look like idiots.

492
00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:36.363
Squidiots.

493
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:38.239
-Oh.
-There's not enough tentacles.

494
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.200
There's supposed to be ten.

495
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.494
-Are you sure it's not eight?
-Ten.

496
00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.622
They're <i>ten</i>-tacles.

497
00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:47.999
Oh. No complaining.

498
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:49.793
Because you girls…

499
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:53.588
look great.

500
00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.719
-Right. but did you…
-Huh?

501
00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.018
Huh?

502
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:09.896
It's. um…

503
00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:11.815
-What do you think?
-Very squid-like.

504
00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:13.108
-Mmm-hmm.
-Right?

505
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.984
-Uh-huh.
-So cute.

506
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.778
Don't lie. Mom. You're laughing.

507
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:17.821
-No.
-No.

508
00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:19.906
-I choked on a cracker.
-Mmm-hmm.

509
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.242
You know what would make this?

510
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:24.786
If we did something around
the neck with like a scarf?

511
00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:27.872
-Or. um. what about a bow tie?
-Bow tie. yes.

512
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.041
-Oh!

513
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.544
The problem is
there's not enough tentacles.

514
00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:35.380
-And more tentacles. definitely.
-Mmm-hmm.

515
00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.674
-And some suction cups.
-Yes.

516
00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.805
You can't be serious.

517
00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.682
There's not enough tentacles.

518
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:48.935
The number of tentacles
is definitely the problem.

519
00:28:49.018 --> 00:28:50.019
Nancy.

520
00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:53.523
I can't wait to see this.

521
00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:56.735
Stars of the show.

522
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.027
She's just jealous.

523
00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:00.822
-You girls are gonna be great.
-Hmm.

524
00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:06.953
There's got to be some way not to do this
besides breaking bones.

525
00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:10.290
Are you sure you haven't figured out
that invisibility spell?

526
00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:13.042
I don't think any spell can help us now.

527
00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:16.921
Maybe we can just hide ourselves
up in the tree house

528
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.632
with ten years of supplies?

529
00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:22.302
They'd probably just cut it down
and make us go.

530
00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:28.183
Mmm. maybe we should just run away?

531
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.269
I love running away. Where should we go?

532
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.230
What about the park?

533
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:36.316
-There's a policeman with a dog.

534
00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:37.859
-He smells you.
-Bye. Katrine.

535
00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:40.320
-Thanks for the costumes.
-You're welcome.

536
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.490
-See you tomorrow.
-Dinner in a half-hour. Ivy.

537
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.577
I signed your permission slip
for the aquarium.

538
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.454
Don't forget to put it in your bag.

539
00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:55.543
I can't believe we didn't see this.

540
00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:56.461
Read!

541
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.672
"Permission to go to the aquarium."

542
00:29:59.756 --> 00:30:01.549
It's the same day as the recital.

543
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.802
We can run away and hide at the aquarium.

544
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:07.680
By the time they find us.
the dance festival will be over.

545
00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:09.432
Yes!

546
00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:15.980
Come on. Ivy!

547
00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:19.400
Watch for cars.

548
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:24.447
Be careful. Cross the street. Come on.

549
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:25.949
I'm gonna catch you. Leo!

550
00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:29.285
Whoa.

551
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.206
Our new home.

552
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:36.125
The minute no one's watching.
we'll find a place to hide.

553
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:38.670
Ivy. Bean. come on. keep up.

554
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:39.671
Coming!

555
00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:41.214
I don't want to lose you.

556
00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:49.764
<i>Welcome to the aquarium.</i>

557
00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:54.143
<i>Today. the Marine Mammal Rescue Team</i>
<i>will be feeding the dolphins at 2 p.m…</i>

558
00:30:54.227 --> 00:30:56.145
What's in your backpacks?

559
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.106
None of your beeswax.

560
00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:01.609
I brought fish chum for the sharks.

561
00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.319
I wanna see a feeding frenzy.

562
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:05.196
-It's gonna be carnage.

563
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.406
Could I throw some?

564
00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:08.616
-I'd love to see a feeding frenzy.
-Ugh!

565
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.827
-And I love sharks.
-How about down there?

566
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.372
Okay. listen up everyone.
Come here. please. Come on.

567
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:17.750
-Come here.
-Whoa! This place is great.

568
00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:22.338
Ivy. Bean.
come up with the rest of us. please.

569
00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:25.216
We're gonna stay
on the first floor today. all right?

570
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.634
Find your field trip buddy.

571
00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:30.555
Eric. Paisley couldn't make it.
So. you and Vanessa should buddy up today.

572
00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:31.890
-Yes. miss.
-Let's go!

573
00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:33.766
Yes. Ms. Aruba-Tate!

574
00:31:38.646 --> 00:31:39.981
Wow!

575
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:42.609
Whoa!

576
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.244
Are there any sharks here?

577
00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:56.831
Even just one great white?
Or any other color will do.

578
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.500
Dusit. we're gonna hand this over
to our expert guide.

579
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:02.795
-And we'll get questions after. okay?
-Whoa!

580
00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:07.300
The sea lions. who call this tank home.
are faster than any other type of seal.

581
00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:09.719
-Wow. look at that!
-Whoa!

582
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:14.432
They can move at 25 miles per hour.
which helps them feed on sardines.

583
00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:17.977
-Oh. they're beautiful!
-But they also love to play not with….

584
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:22.357
sharks so much.
but they are very good surfers.

585
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:26.861
Whoa.

586
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.948
Eric. don't touch the glass. please.

587
00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:33.743
-We don't want any accidents.
-Bean. We gotta go.

588
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.079
-Dusit…
-Whoa!

589
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:38.247
Dusit.
put away the fish chum. please.

590
00:32:54.847 --> 00:32:57.517
Whoa. That could be where we hide out.

591
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.198
Whoa!

592
00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:13.533
This is perfect.

593
00:33:13.616 --> 00:33:15.743
It's so private. I call this one!

594
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.953
This one's mine.

595
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.420
What just happened?

596
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.214
I don't know.

597
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:31.342
Try and find a light.

598
00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:34.095
Okay. There's gotta be one somewhere.

599
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.179
Hmm. Nothing.

600
00:33:37.932 --> 00:33:39.934
I found something!

601
00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:46.065
Whoa. Nelly!

602
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:49.986
<i>The ocean is full of many mysteries…</i>

603
00:33:50.069 --> 00:33:52.655
-Whoa.
<i>-…but none quite as mysterious</i>

604
00:33:52.739 --> 00:33:54.866
<i>as the creatures of the deep.</i>

605
00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:55.950
Ivy?

606
00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:58.453
I get it.

607
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:01.205
This shows what life is like
at the bottom of the sea.

608
00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:03.833
Oh. look.

609
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:06.044
<i>Prepare to be amazed.</i>

610
00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:11.674
What the heck is that?

611
00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:15.762
<i>The extraordinary</i>
<i>anglerfish has a luminous spine</i>

612
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.639
<i>that lures victims into its sharp teeth.</i>

613
00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:24.020
I think I'd rather do the recital.

614
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:25.438
-Me too!

615
00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:33.237
<i> In these black waters</i>
<i>lurks the dragon of the deep.</i>

616
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:35.490
<i>the giant squid.</i>

617
00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:38.618
<i> It watches and waits…</i>

618
00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:40.495
<i>ready to strike.</i>

619
00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:44.999
<i>Are you brave enough</i>
<i>to face its tentacles?</i>

620
00:35:06.813 --> 00:35:08.272
There they are. Thank you.

621
00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:13.152
Ivy. Bean. where were you?
I was so worried.

622
00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:15.905
-We got scared.
-We got really scared.

623
00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:17.949
Oh. no. Because you were lost?

624
00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:20.326
Ye-yes. Lo-lost.

625
00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:22.745
You poor things. I'm so sorry.

626
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:24.372
-It's okay. You're safe now.
-Hmm.

627
00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:26.040
I told you they weren't dead.

628
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:30.461
I didn't say dead.
I said. "Probably eaten by a sea lion."

629
00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:32.922
It's okay.
You're here and safe.

630
00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:35.133
-Thanks. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

631
00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:37.176
We got to see the eels. and you didn't.

632
00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.512
They're freaky scary.

633
00:35:39.595 --> 00:35:42.390
Not as intimidating as a giant squid.

634
00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:45.101
It had this freaky big eye
that hypnotized us.

635
00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:47.353
Bean. a squid can't hypnotize people.

636
00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:49.939
There is not a giant squid in here.

637
00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:52.275
Nobody has a giant squid.

638
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:53.734
Giant squid?

639
00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.070
How did you guys get
to the Creatures of the Deep room?

640
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.030
That's on a totally different floor.

641
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:01.325
-Ivy?
-Uh…

642
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.161
Did you get lost on purpose?

643
00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:06.998
Um… Well… So. I thought--

644
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:11.043
It was kind of my fault. Ms. Aruba-Tate.
Don't blame Ivy.

645
00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:17.133
We started off a little lost.
and then I said. "Let's go this way."

646
00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:19.260
But it was the wrong way.

647
00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:27.018
So. I said. "Here are some stairs
that we can go down together."

648
00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:34.442
Thank you again for everything.

649
00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:35.860
You're welcome. Bye.

650
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.529
We're gonna be leaving
in a minute.

651
00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.447
Yes!

652
00:36:40.823 --> 00:36:42.617
Ivy. Bean.

653
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.120
if I can't trust you two
to behave safely and responsibly.

654
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.165
you realize I won't be able
to take you on any future field trips.

655
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:51.626
I'm sorry. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

656
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.629
I am too. Really sorry. Really.

657
00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:58.132
I know you can help each other do better
when it comes to things like this.

658
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:01.427
I also know
you can help each other do great things.

659
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.847
Eric told me that you're all performing
in a dance recital tonight.

660
00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:07.016
I'm really looking forward to it.

661
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.019
All right. kids.
Please take your seats.

662
00:37:13.689 --> 00:37:17.693
<i>Welcome. one and all.</i>
<i>to tonight's Dance Delirium.</i>

663
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:20.488
<i>-A Festival of Movement in 26 Acts.</i>

664
00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:23.658
<i>-You will be delighted. amazed. and…</i>
-Twenty-six acts?

665
00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:26.869
I hate how they design these recitals
to go on forever.

666
00:37:27.703 --> 00:37:30.831
Oh. I… I mean. not yours. honey.
You were great.

667
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.292
No. no. it's fine. This is gonna be great.

668
00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:36.087
Great for me.

669
00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:38.172
Twenty dollars is mine.

670
00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:42.677
There's no way these squidiots
are gonna be stars of the show.

671
00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:49.350
Oh.

672
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.425
Huh?

673
00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:25.553
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

674
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.888
<i>Act 14 will start in one minute.</i>

675
00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:34.812
Five.

676
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.106
Ten.

677
00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:39.734
Fifteen.

678
00:38:41.694 --> 00:38:42.695
Twenty.

679
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.284
Securing rope. Almost ready.

680
00:38:48.367 --> 00:38:49.410
Standing by.

681
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.538
Standing by. Raise.

682
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:54.415
Put some muscle into it. <i>Maman.</i>

683
00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.125
We don't have all day.

684
00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:58.753
Whale ascending! Whale ascending.

685
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.507
You guys like my fins?

686
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:05.217
Like a real fish.

687
00:39:05.301 --> 00:39:07.094
Put your back into it. <i>Maman.</i>

688
00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.263
-Oh! <i>Maman!</i>

689
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:12.725
You guys do look.

690
00:39:12.808 --> 00:39:14.643
uh. friendly.

691
00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:17.355
which is good because in the program

692
00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:19.732
it does say that you are friendly squids.

693
00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:22.651
I don't think Monsieur Joie
has seen a real squid.

694
00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:25.905
A real giant squid is not friendly at all.

695
00:39:25.988 --> 00:39:29.033
Who has the glitter?
The glitter is <i>très </i>important!

696
00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:29.950
Mm-mm.

697
00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:31.744
Where are my stars?

698
00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:33.913
Where are my stars?

699
00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:35.498
Where are you?

700
00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:37.291
<i>-Je suis ici. monsieur.</i>
-Oh!

701
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.504
-Then. now I can focus.
-Oh. no.

702
00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:43.672
You really can't dance
with those tentacles.

703
00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:49.136
Which. when you think about it
is. well. probably a good thing.

704
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.013
-You are the fish.
-Hmm.

705
00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:53.474
Feel the water. See the coral.

706
00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:58.187
Oh. Mademoiselles Bean and Ivy.

707
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.233
Well. you certainly are.
um… well-tentacled.

708
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.569
Uh. just please don't knock down the set.

709
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.655
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

710
00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:10.199
Places! Places! 14th act! That's us!

711
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:12.660
-Tout de suite! That means get on stage!
-Go. go.

712
00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.203
Get on stage!

713
00:40:14.703 --> 00:40:17.415
<i> Please take your seats.</i>
<i>Act 14 is about to commence.</i>

714
00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:19.500
Amanda. look!

715
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:24.088
So talented.

716
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:26.090
Wow!

717
00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:34.598
-Oh.
-Oh.

718
00:40:39.728 --> 00:40:41.355
Uh… uh…

719
00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:45.943
-Is that really Bean and Ivy?
-So goofy.

720
00:40:46.026 --> 00:40:47.153
What do I do?

721
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:48.696
Put your arms up.

722
00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.707
-Look. Ivy. over here! Quickly!
-Ah!

723
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.083
Spin. spin. spin!

724
00:41:03.752 --> 00:41:05.379
-Watch out. Bean.
-Sorry. Ivy.

725
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.968
Twenty dollars.

726
00:41:12.094 --> 00:41:14.180
Whoa. whoa.

727
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:18.434
-Wait. Are we supposed to be in the back?
-Oh.

728
00:41:35.034 --> 00:41:36.577
You're right. Ivy.

729
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.038
A real squid is the opposite of friendly.

730
00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:41.790
A real squid would never
just stand around wiggling.

731
00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:44.418
A real squid just lurks in the shadows

732
00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:48.380
until it's time to attack.
like the Wilis in <i>Giselle.</i>

733
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:50.799
A real squid doesn't care
about a stupid bet

734
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:52.134
with a stupid big sister.

735
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:54.887
A real squid doesn't care
if people laugh at them.

736
00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.264
A real squid doesn't care about anything.

737
00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:58.933
It rules the seas.

738
00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:04.063
-We're standing by with the glitter.
-Mmm-hmm.

739
00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:06.440
-And go.

740
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:09.777
Go. Go. go. go. Faster. Come on. faster.

741
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.332
-Zuzu!

742
00:42:23.415 --> 00:42:25.042
-Huh?

743
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:29.004
Come on. friendly squid. Help a whale out!

744
00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.555
No. no. no. no. no.

745
00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:40.349
-Squids coming through.

746
00:42:40.432 --> 00:42:42.518
Oh. oh!

747
00:42:42.601 --> 00:42:44.562
Ah!

748
00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:46.480
Whoa!

749
00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:48.274
-Oh!

750
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.199
When I dance.
my body and soul soars!

751
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:08.419
Good job!

752
00:43:26.312 --> 00:43:28.022
The show must go on.

753
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.070
We're out! We're done!

754
00:43:35.154 --> 00:43:37.448
And we never have to go back on stage!

755
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:41.577
Or stand around in first position.
We can do what squid do.

756
00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:49.043
Giant squid versus whale!

757
00:43:58.093 --> 00:44:00.304
Squid! Squid! Squid!

758
00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:01.972
-Huh?
-Squid! Squid!

759
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.599
Squid! Squid!

760
00:44:03.682 --> 00:44:04.975
Do they mean us?

761
00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.479
Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid!

762
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.941
-Squid! Squid! Squid!
-Go. Squid!

763
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:15.319
Squid! Squid!
Squid! Squid! Squid!

764
00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:20.741
Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid!
Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid!

765
00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:21.659
Squid! Squid!

766
00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:26.163
Squid! Squid! Squid!
Squid! Squid! Squid! Squid!

767
00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:28.415
-Squid! Squid! Squid!

768
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.417
-Squid forever!

769
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:34.004
-Brava!
-Brava!

770
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:35.089
-Yes!

771
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.924
Encore! Encore!

772
00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.176
You were right not to let them quit.

773
00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:41.637
Yes. but let's agree
that they're quitting after this.

774
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.638
Oh. thank God.

775
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:05.911
-Yeah.
-Three hundred people cheering for us?

776
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:07.871
I still can't believe it.

777
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:09.665
We were the stars. Ivy.

778
00:45:09.748 --> 00:45:10.833
Bean.

779
00:45:10.916 --> 00:45:13.877
all I can say to you two is…

780
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:24.221
You earned this.

781
00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.480
And you earned this.

782
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.405
-Mom. I can get my ears pierced?
-Mmm-hmm.

783
00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:42.906
Why'd you change your mind?

784
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.869
You convinced me a while ago. honey.
I was just waiting for the perfect moment.

785
00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:53.500
Twenty dollars. Ivy. Twenty! We're rich!

786
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:55.961
It's your money. Bean.

787
00:45:56.044 --> 00:45:59.256
It's our money.
You heard my sister. we earned it.

788
00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:01.884
So. what should we spend it on?

789
00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:04.511
There's so many things we can do together.

790
00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.764
I've got some pretty good ideas.

791
00:46:06.847 --> 00:46:07.681
Don't you?

792
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:08.849
Mmm-hmm.

793
00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.851
Ivy. Bean. come.

794
00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.187
-You saved the day. Come on!

795
00:46:13.687 --> 00:46:16.982
-Squid versus squid!
-Go squid!

796
00:46:17.649 --> 00:46:19.401
Squids are the best!

797
00:46:29.077 --> 00:46:30.871
What are you doing. Bean?

798
00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.623
I'm making the Pit of Doom.

799
00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:34.500
Wanna help? It'll be fun.

800
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:38.128
The only thing
that's gonna fall in this pit is you.

801
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:41.215
-Why don't you ask the new girl?
-<i>Ivy? All she does is read.</i>

802
00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.383
-She reads at recess.
-What's wrong with Bean?

803
00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:46.386
She just runs around and makes noise.

804
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.015
Just wanna wash your uniform
for you!

805
00:46:50.098 --> 00:46:51.433
Oh.

806
00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:54.394
You know the rules.
Three strikes. you're out.

807
00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:55.813
I'm running away.

808
00:46:55.896 --> 00:46:57.856
Psst. Follow me.

809
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.610
<i> I just learned the spell</i>
<i>that makes you dance forever.</i>

810
00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:03.904
Mom wants you home now!

811
00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:08.575
<i>Let's sneak through the backyards</i>
<i>to creep up on Nancy and do the spell.</i>

812
00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:21.338
I hope you're ready to dance forever!

813
00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:02.880
-Hmm?

814
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.099
No!

815
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:24.359
Large squid.

816
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:35.829
<i>Maman.</i>

817
00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:02.940
Au revoir!

818
00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:14.201
Battement! Battement! Marching.

819
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:16.578
-Cut!
