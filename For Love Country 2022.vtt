Everything about it is
to protect our being

7
00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:26.843
and push us further.

8
00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:35.670

A farmer can sow bad seeds.

the soil will return to you good and bad.

17
00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:11.626

black artists have been pushed
to the margins of the genre.

23
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.396
A new crop of artists are
seeking to change that

24

and reclaim their place on
the country music charts.

I'm still like in that moment where

36
00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.825
I haven't really grasped it all.

37

reality and I'm not dreaming.

73
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.163
(gentle music)

74
00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:22.188
My mom. she was just on board
with it from the very start.

75
00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:24.201
She always told me that God told her

76
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.490
that I wasn't gonna be with her

77
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.333
in Baltimore for a long time.

78
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:31.166
and she knew it long before I did.

79
00:04:34.356 --> 00:04:38.035
So. I just wanted to do country music.

80
00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:39.209
I fell in love with it

81
00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:41.189
when my friend Keisha down in Baltimore.

82
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.338
my hometown. found me a CD to listen to.

83
00:04:44.338 --> 00:04:46.535
She was like. you need
to check out The Chicks.

84
00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:48.216
Back then they were the Dixie Chicks.

85
00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:49.950
And I just fell in love.

86
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.649
went on this whole rabbit hole.

87
00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:53.365
watchin' all the music videos

88
00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.948
and listenin' to country radio.

89
00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:58.530
I remember watching documentaries

90
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.839
on Taylor Swift and Reba.

91
00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.571
and they always said the same thing.

92
00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:04.967
You just have to move to Nashville.

93
00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:07.706
When you realize that you have
a passion for country music.

94
00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.082
you just gotta get to
where the country music is.

95
00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:12.749
(gentle music)

96
00:05:14.322 --> 00:05:18.218
I finally got the nerve and moved here.

97
00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.013
and it's been eight years.

98
00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:22.680
(gentle music)

99
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:31.303
I remember feeling discouraged

100
00:05:31.303 --> 00:05:33.886
because my sound was different.

101
00:05:35.694 --> 00:05:36.816
I sound like I'm from Baltimore.

102
00:05:36.816 --> 00:05:38.316
I don't hide that.

103
00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:43.099
I don't got a twang. but
I got a Baltimore accent.

104
00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.766
And I bring all of that with me.

105
00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.432
because the thing that
I've always wanted to do

106
00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:51.666
is just make the music
I wish I heard as a kid.

107
00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:53.327
When I started listening to country music

108
00:05:53.327 --> 00:05:55.967
when I was 14 or 15 years old.

109
00:05:55.967 --> 00:06:00.652
I quickly realized it wasn't
anybody that looked like me.

110
00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.556
And I realized there wasn't anyone

111
00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:03.823
bringing in a lot of the sounds

112
00:06:03.823 --> 00:06:07.346
that I heard throughout
my life. my childhood.

113
00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:10.534
R&B. gospel. I mean even classical.

114
00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.034
I love that. rock.

115
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.776
I wasn't hearing that all the time.

116
00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:18.736
and so it may made me feel like an other.

117
00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:21.753
listening to someone else's music.

118
00:06:21.753 --> 00:06:24.420
(gentle music)

119
00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.669
- Honestly. the thing that
brought me to Nashville

120
00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:37.919
was the people.

121
00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.690
When I started meeting
people from Nashville.

122
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.552
I could tell that.

123
00:06:43.552 --> 00:06:44.677
kinda the thing that
people always talk about.

124
00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:47.594
that country music was a community.

125
00:06:49.064 --> 00:06:53.147
Nashville is just this
little scene unto its own.

126
00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:57.210
There's this thing where
country music singers.

127
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.378
they go to the grocery store.

128
00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:01.094
they go to the same bars as you.

129
00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:02.373
they go to the same whatever.

130
00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:03.946
So there's this closeness.

131
00:07:03.946 --> 00:07:07.343
this community that really exists.

132
00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:11.293
I think that it speaks to
the culture of country music

133
00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:14.084
in a good way and a bad way.

134
00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:16.973
because there is a level of

135
00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:19.422
nobody wants to shake any feathers

136
00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:23.570
because everything is calm and
everything is kinda the same

137
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.624
and everything has existed in
this way for such a long time.

138
00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:29.624
(scenery whooshing)

139
00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:35.662
(television popping)

140
00:07:39.178 --> 00:07:43.537
- If we understand the
history of this genre.

141
00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:46.913
of this sound. and understand that

142
00:07:46.913 --> 00:07:49.764
it is as much a part of black tradition

143
00:07:49.764 --> 00:07:52.111
as it is white tradition.

144
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:55.681
and if we understand black
people have always been here

145
00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:57.501
and have always been a fan of this music.

146
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:00.084
have always created this music.

147
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.290
But. I think when you're an
artist and you're comin' in.

148
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.600
like it takes a certain kinda mindset.

149
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.191
a special kinda mindset to be like.

150
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.853
I'm gonna start from scratch.

151
00:08:10.853 --> 00:08:12.831
and I'm gonna do that on my own.

152
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:17.831
(curtain creaking)
(haunting music)

153
00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:32.571
- I think that sometimes you
feel led to do something.

154
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:36.821
but you might be scared.
'cause nobody has done it.

155
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:40.558
Or very few people have done it.

156
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:45.284
I just had to make a pathway for myself.

157
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.363
I started makin' music

158
00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:58.070
when I was probably like 11 years old.

159
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.570
My uncle bought me a keyboard.

160
00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:04.477
By the time I was about 16.

161
00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:07.583
I was workin' at Sears
in the mall in Memphis.

162
00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:11.499
and I met this guy named
Chris who had tracks.

163
00:09:11.499 --> 00:09:12.451
He said. "Come over here."

164
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.985
And I made my first song.

165
00:09:14.985 --> 00:09:16.085
and that's when I knew for real.

166
00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:19.835
like I knew I had to
pursue this as a career.

167
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:27.668
I would always go to LA or
Houston or Atlanta. New York.

168
00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:31.293
I met a guy named Courtney Benson.

169
00:09:31.293 --> 00:09:32.467
and I knew the Nelly song.

Courtney was the one
that really helped me.

178
00:09:50.797 --> 00:09:53.109
That's how I got in the
game was just doin' tracks

179
00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:56.034
and singin' hooks for Nelly and Ashanti

180
00:09:56.034 --> 00:09:58.201
and Chingy or Youngbloods.

181
00:09:59.623 --> 00:10:02.082
I grew up in Memphis where Three 6 Mafia

182
00:10:02.082 --> 00:10:04.481
was always in everybody's car.

183
00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:07.171
And that was startin' to be the sound

184
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:09.411
of all rap music to me.

185
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:12.078
(muffled music)

186
00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:20.499
And I was completely tired of
it (laughing) at that point.

187
00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:23.845
I listened to it my whole upbringing.

188
00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:25.223
I was livin' in Atlanta.

189
00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:27.092
and I was comin' up to Nashville a lot.

190
00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:28.895
and I was hearin' country music.

191
00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.663
and I was really startin' to like it.

192
00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:33.314
I was hearin' things like Zac Brown Band.

193
00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:35.085
records that sounded different

194
00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:38.085
than the country music I grew up on.

195
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:42.391
So now I'm listenin' to this music

196
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:47.141
that has this whole band.
guitars. and strings and steel.

197
00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:50.726
Whenever something's bendin'
like the steel guitar.

198
00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:52.214
bendin'. it's soul to me.

199
00:10:52.214 --> 00:10:55.797
So I'm like. this has
got soul music to it.

200
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.760
And then I started
diggin' into older songs.

201
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.680
like realizing Dolly Parton
songs were so beautiful

202
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.266
and Patsy Cline songs
that had jazz influence

203
00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.958
and all these different influences.

204
00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.708
I was like.

205
00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:14.041

Yow.

228
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.841
(Scenery whooshing)

229
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.848
- Country music.

230
00:12:49.848 --> 00:12:53.686
Well. country music was
somethin' always been here.

231
00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:56.423
So when I think. when I stepped out.

232
00:12:56.423 --> 00:13:00.972
outside the household.
country music's what we heard.

233
00:13:00.972 --> 00:13:03.389
It's country music city here.

234
00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:08.809
- When you listen to the songs
and just some of the things.

235
00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:11.702
the struggles. 'cause a
lot of that country music.

236
00:13:11.702 --> 00:13:14.106
if you listen to the
word and they struggle.

237
00:13:14.106 --> 00:13:15.695
and they're just tryin'
to put that perspective

238
00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:17.455
on what they went through.

239
00:13:17.455 --> 00:13:18.972
relationship. with marriages.

240
00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:20.913
all that's tied up with country music.

241
00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:22.953
'cause mostly what they're singin' about.

242
00:13:22.953 --> 00:13:24.616
the past and the present

243
00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:27.400
and how they was able to get out of it.

244
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.104
So my perspective on country music.

245
00:13:29.104 --> 00:13:31.892
I enjoy listenin' to country music.

246
00:13:31.892 --> 00:13:34.186
but I listen to a lot of the words

247
00:13:34.186 --> 00:13:36.686
when I do listen to the songs.

248
00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:42.764
- Music is the thing for me that

249
00:13:42.764 --> 00:13:44.847
levels the playing field.

250
00:13:47.237 --> 00:13:49.667
Initially I wanted to be an artist.

251
00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:54.597
♪ My savior all the day long ♪

252
00:13:54.597 --> 00:13:58.244
♪ This is my story ♪

253
00:13:58.244 --> 00:14:01.186
I started doing YouTube
throughout high school.

254
00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:03.970
It didn't really do much.

255
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.962
♪ All the day long ♪

256
00:14:06.962 --> 00:14:09.620
I eventually had a couple
videos that had done well.

257
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.224
but just not anything enough on YouTube

258
00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:15.641
to really push the needle professionally.

259
00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:18.769
And some people were like.

260
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:20.198
"You could write songs

261
00:14:20.198 --> 00:14:22.184
"and potentially you could
write songs for people."

262
00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:23.394
I was like. okay. cool.

263
00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:24.227
Like I'm into that.

264
00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:25.244
Let me see what I can do.

265
00:14:25.244 --> 00:14:27.760
And so I ended up going out to Atlanta.

266
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.086
just kinda shadowed some producers.

267
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:33.386
And that was kind of how
I started to level up

268
00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:36.124
even more as a songwriter.

269
00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:37.988
It was primarily R&B and hip hop.

270
00:14:37.988 --> 00:14:39.316
just 'cause I was in Atlanta.

271
00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:41.276
and those were kinda the
opportunities that I had

272
00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:44.118
based on producers and writers
that I was working with.

273
00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:46.838
But there were some people
within country music

274
00:14:46.838 --> 00:14:49.472
that I felt like were
making progressive stuff

275
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.816
than the country music that I was

276
00:14:50.816 --> 00:14:53.468
being put onto in high school and college.

277
00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:55.408
I liked a lotta Sam Hunt stuff.

278
00:14:55.408 --> 00:14:58.246
I was listenin' to some Kane Brown stuff.

279
00:14:58.246 --> 00:15:01.556
The genre has come a long way quickly.

280
00:15:01.556 --> 00:15:04.194
So I was like. this is a good time for me

281
00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:07.468
to bring some of the influences
and experience that I have

282
00:15:07.468 --> 00:15:10.024
from living in Atlanta
for the past few years

283
00:15:10.024 --> 00:15:13.941
and try to incorporate
it into what's going on.

284
00:15:16.836 --> 00:15:20.184
So I was like. I need to go to Nashville

285
00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:24.012
and see what is really
going on within the genre.

286
00:15:24.012 --> 00:15:27.179
'Cause I'm an outsider in this moment.

287
00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:33.364
So I came out to Nashville
and then I realized.

288
00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:34.874
they're basically writing the same way

289
00:15:34.874 --> 00:15:36.746
that I typically write.

290
00:15:36.746 --> 00:15:38.922
They're just doing it with
some different phrases

291
00:15:38.922 --> 00:15:40.912
and they're doing it with
some different instruments.

292
00:15:40.912 --> 00:15:44.208
but the same stuff that
I would do. my process.

293
00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:46.875
in Atlanta was pretty similar to

294
00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:49.802
what they were doing in Nashville.

295
00:15:49.802 --> 00:15:51.348
So I was like. okay.

296
00:15:51.348 --> 00:15:52.402
This is dope.

297
00:15:52.402 --> 00:15:55.474
I don't have to relearn anything. really.

298
00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:57.807
I was like. I just.
they're just writing songs

299
00:15:57.807 --> 00:15:59.640
based around concepts.

300
00:16:01.906 --> 00:16:03.063
Like there's no nothing that

301
00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:06.967
would allow you to write an R&B
song that would preclude you

302
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:09.368
from being able to write
a good country song.

303
00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.390
because the best versions
of both of those things

304
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.681
are pretty similar.

305
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.348
(gentle music)

306
00:16:17.222 --> 00:16:21.106
- I think it probably
speaks to the storytelling.

307
00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:22.523
the instrumentation.

308
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:25.039
Country music is a genre that.

309
00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:27.401
even as it's gotten more popular.

310
00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:31.327
has still maintained this sense of purity.

311
00:16:31.327 --> 00:16:33.571
There's still live guitar.

312
00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:34.810
There's still live drums.

313
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.748
Even now. again. as we get to this hip hop

314
00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:38.843
where there are these country artists

315
00:16:38.843 --> 00:16:42.819
that really incorporate a
lot of these R&B influences

316
00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:45.349
or a lot of these hip hop influences.

317
00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:47.953
you're still probably gonna
put some pedal still over it.

318
00:16:47.953 --> 00:16:50.775
And music is such a wonderful art form

319
00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:54.942
in that it's always pulling
from different spaces.

320
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.590
(birds chirping)

321
00:17:05.004 --> 00:17:09.948
- My earliest memory of music
is hearing my mom's voice

322
00:17:09.948 --> 00:17:11.781
and hearing her piano.

323
00:17:14.932 --> 00:17:18.550
She couldn't express
her love with her words

324
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.800
or with physical affection.

325
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.790
but I could hear it in the way she played.

326
00:17:29.226 --> 00:17:30.096
One of my earliest memories

327
00:17:30.096 --> 00:17:33.360
is crawling under the
piano while she played.

328
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.142
When she was very upset
about things. she would play.

329
00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:39.014
And I loved to hear her. so I would.

330
00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:40.714
I remember seeing her feet on the pedals

331
00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:42.636
and I could see the edge of her wrists

332
00:17:42.636 --> 00:17:44.719
and the edge of her hand.

333
00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:47.921
And that's where I would feel moments

334
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.184
of connection and safety with her

335
00:17:50.184 --> 00:17:51.698
was when I could hear her play.

336
00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:54.781
(gentle banjo music)

337
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.554
My mom says I was humming
before I could speak.

338
00:18:00.554 --> 00:18:02.152
And if she was playing the piano.

339
00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:05.319
I would hum with her in the right key.

340
00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:11.024
And I remember humming and singing

341
00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:13.746
to make myself feel less scared.

342
00:18:13.746 --> 00:18:17.312
And that is something that I feel like

343
00:18:17.312 --> 00:18:21.645
connects me really directly
with the black diaspora.

345
00:18:27.852 --> 00:18:32.852
I got myself a secondhand banjo

That kind of opened a whole world to me.

347
00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.768
I loved the sound of it.

348
00:18:38.768 --> 00:18:40.636
and I didn't know anything about it.

349
00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:45.303

for me in this special way.

00:19:20.674 --> 00:19:22.542
They were one year in.

357
00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:25.176
And I remember just
being like thunderstruck

358
00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:27.388
when I saw these three
beautiful black people

359
00:19:27.388 --> 00:19:32.302
playing fiddle and banjos
and singing these old time.

360
00:19:32.302 --> 00:19:35.090
♪ And I can't tell my daughters ♪

361
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.454
♪ All the things that I've said ♪

362
00:19:39.454 --> 00:19:42.125
- [Allyson] It was revelatory
for me to hear black women

363
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.706
singing their own experiences.

364
00:19:43.706 --> 00:19:48.706
♪ Afraid of that bright glory up above ♪

365
00:19:49.068 --> 00:19:50.010
- [Allyson] I understood that music

366
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.134
has always been the thing

367
00:19:51.134 --> 00:19:53.967
that helped people survive trauma.

368
00:19:56.475 --> 00:19:57.754
That's how I know how to do it.

369
00:19:57.754 --> 00:20:01.870
is through writing songs
and singing them for people

370
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.120
and trying to connect as much as I can.

371
00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:17.338
(birds chirping)

372
00:20:20.346 --> 00:20:25.013
- Growin' up I was a big
Charley Pride fan. Matchbox 20.

373
00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:29.459
Tupac. Sevendust. Prince. Brooks & Dunn.

374
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.480
kinda just everything.

375
00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:38.734
My music. kind of the stories
I tell through the songs

376
00:20:38.734 --> 00:20:41.304
and kinda how I grew up. where I grew up.

377
00:20:41.304 --> 00:20:45.471
what I liked to wear.
country music fit me better.

378
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.117
I moved to Nashville in 2007.

379
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.003
And 2007

380
00:20:57.284 --> 00:21:00.451
country was still pretty traditional.

381
00:21:01.686 --> 00:21:04.266
Of course I had a few people
at different labels saying.

382
00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:06.066
"Well it wouldn't work."

383
00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:09.113
'Cause I was black or I had
this one dude at a label.

384
00:21:09.113 --> 00:21:11.493
I won't say his name. but he was like.

385
00:21:11.493 --> 00:21:13.274
"Yeah man. I like you. you're a good guy.

386
00:21:13.274 --> 00:21:16.253
"but I'm not sure about
how country music fans

387
00:21:16.253 --> 00:21:18.543
"would feel about your people."

388
00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:20.460
And I was like. "What?"

389
00:21:22.404 --> 00:21:23.237
I ain't.

390
00:21:26.181 --> 00:21:28.066
I remember after I signed with Broken Bow

391
00:21:28.066 --> 00:21:29.558
my first single went
number one. he emails me.

392
00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:31.046
He said. "Dude. congrats. man.

393
00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:33.815
"I always knew you'd make it."

394
00:21:33.815 --> 00:21:35.262
I'm a straight shooter.

395
00:21:35.262 --> 00:21:37.054
so I emailed him back.
said. "Don't lie to me. bro.

396
00:21:37.054 --> 00:21:37.913
"You told me it wouldn't do.

397
00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:38.837
"You ain't gotta lie.

398
00:21:38.837 --> 00:21:43.837
"You coulda just said
congratulations and kept it at that."

399
00:21:44.123 --> 00:21:45.923
But I feel like it's our job to realize

400
00:21:45.923 --> 00:21:48.588
that there are certain
barriers that are there.

401
00:21:48.588 --> 00:21:51.757
certain obstacles that are there.

402
00:21:51.757 --> 00:21:53.303
And we have to get past that.

403
00:21:53.303 --> 00:21:57.973
And the one way to always
get past it is great music.

404
00:21:57.973 --> 00:21:59.248
If your music's trash. it's trash.

405
00:21:59.248 --> 00:22:00.810
That's just facts.

406
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.643
No matter what your skin color is.

407
00:22:06.337 --> 00:22:08.340
We can only control who we are.

408
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.351
what we do. and the quality
of music we put out.

409
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:14.018
(gentle music)

410
00:22:33.283 --> 00:22:35.033
- I grew up in Texas.

411
00:22:38.209 --> 00:22:42.876
My church drove us to see a
Texas Rangers baseball game.

412
00:22:44.584 --> 00:22:46.679
I was in the nosebleed section.

413
00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:49.104
and the announcer says.

414
00:22:49.104 --> 00:22:51.181
"Please rise as 10-year-old LeAnn Rimes

415
00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:52.790
"sings the National Anthem."

416
00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.540
(crowd cheering)

417
00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:59.622
When I heard her sing.
that's when I was like.

418
00:22:59.622 --> 00:23:00.955
I wanna do that.

419
00:23:04.615 --> 00:23:08.354
My grandmother lived
in a really tiny shack

420
00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:09.592
in Riesel. Texas.

421
00:23:09.592 --> 00:23:11.532
and when I would go over to her house.

422
00:23:11.532 --> 00:23:14.098
she would have hanging
on the back of her door

423
00:23:14.098 --> 00:23:17.720
all these VHS tapes of Dolly
Parton and Kenny Rogers

424
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.470
and "Steel Magnolias"
and any Southern movie.

425
00:23:22.748 --> 00:23:24.961
So I wanted to do country music.

426
00:23:24.961 --> 00:23:27.878
(curtain clicking)

427
00:23:31.564 --> 00:23:33.350
Hey. y'all. it's Mickey Guyton here.

428
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.612
I hope you guys are having
an amazing CMA Fest.

429
00:23:35.612 --> 00:23:39.544
This is my first CMA Fest.
and I'm so excited to be here.

430
00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:42.454
- Hey guys. I'm Erica Grace
Powell hangin' out at CMA Fest.

431
00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.784
One of my favorite girls in country music.

432
00:23:44.784 --> 00:23:47.330
Miss Mickey Guyton. is here with us today.

433
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.162
How are you?
- I am so good.

434
00:23:49.162 --> 00:23:50.690
I'm just obsessed with you.

435
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.857
Hey. y'all I'm Mickey Guyton.

436
00:23:51.857 --> 00:23:55.584
and I am so excited to
be hosting the red carpet

437
00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:58.173
with the ACM Awards with
Sounds Like Nashville.

438
00:23:58.173 --> 00:24:00.840
(gentle music)

439
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.630
I jumped in blindly. but when
I signed to Capitol Records.

440
00:24:07.662 --> 00:24:10.228
Mike Duncan did call me.

441
00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:14.978
He said that it's going to be
really difficult for women.

442
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.122
He didn't even mention people of color.

443
00:24:20.122 --> 00:24:23.539
And I was thinking. it can't be that bad.

444
00:24:24.399 --> 00:24:25.283
We'll be fine.

445
00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:26.136
I'll be fine.

446
00:24:26.136 --> 00:24:27.609
I've got a great label.

447
00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:28.784
I've got great management.

448
00:24:28.784 --> 00:24:31.201
Like this is going to happen.

449
00:24:32.373 --> 00:24:34.540
And then. reality sets in.

450
00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:38.016
(somber music)

451
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:41.484
I got questioned at every turn.

452
00:24:43.303 --> 00:24:45.173
It was like you've gotta make sure

453
00:24:45.173 --> 00:24:46.585
that you're really country.

454
00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.931
'cause people are gonna think
that you're disingenuous.

455
00:24:48.931 --> 00:24:52.432
And I'm thinking to myself.
I grew up in Crawford. Texas.

456
00:24:52.432 --> 00:24:54.523
It doesn't get much countrier than that.

457
00:24:54.523 --> 00:24:57.106
(somber music)

458
00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:02.708
I was signed because
people loved my artistry.

459
00:25:04.197 --> 00:25:06.645
And it was like they
tried to change everything

460
00:25:06.645 --> 00:25:10.676
and wash everything that made me me away

461
00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:13.926
and put this other person on top of me.

462
00:25:17.834 --> 00:25:22.167
There's this formula on how
to make it in Nashville.

463
00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:28.355
I've followed the Nashville
way for almost 10 years.

464
00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:32.488
It does not work for anybody

465
00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:37.172
unless you are a white. tall male.

466
00:25:39.403 --> 00:25:41.170
Like it is golden for you.

467
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.277
You just follow that formula.

468
00:25:42.277 --> 00:25:44.843
you're gonna have like 10 number ones

469
00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:48.787
and a ranch and your own
label and a bar on Broadway.

470
00:25:48.787 --> 00:25:50.704
like all of the things.

471
00:25:55.352 --> 00:25:56.199
Which is crazy.

472
00:25:56.199 --> 00:25:59.500
'cause there's so many
different people in the world.

473
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.452
and you could be shutting off

474
00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:03.119
so many opportunities like that.

475
00:26:06.454 --> 00:26:09.371
It doesn't just have to be one way.

476
00:26:12.465 --> 00:26:15.132
(gentle music)

477
00:26:21.082 --> 00:26:24.669
- I had went as far as I
could go in my hometown.

478
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:26.366
which is High Point. North Carolina.

479
00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:29.217
(gentle music)

480
00:26:29.217 --> 00:26:31.143
- [Announcer] Please
welcome Frankie Staton.

481
00:26:31.143 --> 00:26:33.893
(crowd cheering)

482
00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:40.255
- I would just like to say
that I wrote this song because

483
00:26:40.255 --> 00:26:42.771
at the heart of everybody.

484
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:44.683
they wanna be loved for who they are.

485
00:26:44.683 --> 00:26:47.183
(piano music)

486
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:58.101
My wish for you all is that
you find that in your life.

487
00:26:58.115 --> 00:27:00.412
I was playin' for the
International Furniture Markets.

488
00:27:00.412 --> 00:27:03.329
which was the industry of our city.

489
00:27:05.093 --> 00:27:09.498
And I would play for people
from all over the world.

490
00:27:09.498 --> 00:27:12.304
Every now and then I'd slip
one of my own original songs in

491
00:27:12.304 --> 00:27:14.140
and they would say. "Did
you really write that?

492
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.973
"Is that your music?"

493
00:27:14.973 --> 00:27:17.306
♪ Oooh yeah ♪

494
00:27:20.713 --> 00:27:21.565
And they would say.

495
00:27:21.565 --> 00:27:26.148
"You need to go somewhere
where somebody can hear you."

496
00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:29.383
Being a Southern girl

497
00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:31.729
and having a love of all kinds of music

498
00:27:31.729 --> 00:27:34.807
and especially country music.

499
00:27:34.807 --> 00:27:37.474
I thought. I'll go to Nashville.

500
00:27:40.842 --> 00:27:42.663
I was always about the talent

501
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:45.128
and the music and the creativity.

502
00:27:45.128 --> 00:27:49.380
So at that point I had already been around

503
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.916
all kinds of people from everywhere.

504
00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:55.006
and they seemed to enjoy what I did.

505
00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:58.220
So I didn't look at it
like. oh. I'm a black woman.

506
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.887
(gentle music)

507
00:28:02.146 --> 00:28:05.650
Nashville taught me that
I was a black woman.

508
00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.078
They made me know that.

509
00:28:07.078 --> 00:28:09.524
(gentle music)

510
00:28:09.524 --> 00:28:12.802
They made me know that my
blackness made me different.

511
00:28:12.802 --> 00:28:15.469
(gentle music)

512
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.841
- [Participant] I do
pose a question a lot.

513
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:32.066
just to get people to think.

514
00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:34.483
and it's who built Nashville?

515
00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:44.126
Like. who built this place?

516
00:29:06.064 --> 00:29:07.216
- I mean. Nashville's a lot different

517
00:29:07.216 --> 00:29:09.728
than what it used to be
when I was growin' up.

518
00:29:09.728 --> 00:29:11.728
But to me. this is home.

519
00:29:15.864 --> 00:29:19.720
There's very few of us
left. original Nashvillians.

520
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.302
kids that went to Metro. MMPS
schools. and stuff like that.

521
00:29:23.302 --> 00:29:26.552
So to me. this is always gonna be home.

522
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.158
If I close my eyes and think about it.

523
00:29:31.158 --> 00:29:34.250
the first thing I'm gonna
see is Jefferson Street.

524
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.083
You know what I'm sayin'?

525
00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:36.472
The first thing I'm gonna taste is

526
00:29:36.472 --> 00:29:39.139
the biscuits at Knock-Out Wings.

527
00:29:40.584 --> 00:29:42.501
My sister went to Fisk.

528
00:29:43.712 --> 00:29:45.430
I went to TSU right up the street.

529
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.097
(intense music)

530
00:29:55.798 --> 00:29:59.234
(gentle gospel music)

531
00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:00.680
A big part of music growing up

532
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.702
in Nashville was going to church.

533
00:30:02.702 --> 00:30:04.878
and the choir was so incredible.

534
00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:07.598
You would have these different musicians

535
00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:11.560
that were just world class
musicians playin' gospel music.

536
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.834
And at the time I didn't really have

537
00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:14.208
the same appreciation
'cause there wasn't nobody

538
00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:16.860
tryin' to listen to no gospel
music for real like that.

539
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.307
I'd rather be listening to Ludacris

540
00:30:18.307 --> 00:30:20.786
or somethin' like that. but.

541
00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:21.974
when I look going it.

542
00:30:21.974 --> 00:30:24.440
I realized how much of
an impact it had on me

543
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.762
and how much I value

544
00:30:26.762 --> 00:30:29.257
black music and black
musicians in Nashville.

545
00:30:29.257 --> 00:30:31.924
(gentle music)

546
00:30:43.046 --> 00:30:44.764
- Me and my father.

547
00:30:44.764 --> 00:30:48.503
we moved from Chattanooga
to Johnson City. Tennessee

548
00:30:48.503 --> 00:30:49.586
back in 2006.

549
00:30:52.905 --> 00:30:55.589
My mother passed away when I was 17.

550
00:30:55.589 --> 00:30:57.672
and we pretty much. just.

551
00:30:58.682 --> 00:31:00.128
we needed to like start over.

552
00:31:00.128 --> 00:31:03.461
have a fresh start in a different place.

553
00:31:04.718 --> 00:31:06.932
I kinda felt this sense of in betweeness

554
00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:09.826
because I was a black girl

555
00:31:09.826 --> 00:31:13.593
growin' up in very
conservative white suburbia.

556
00:31:13.593 --> 00:31:17.760
also dealing with like my
gender and my sexuality.

557
00:31:20.004 --> 00:31:22.637
I was going to East
Tennessee State University.

558
00:31:22.637 --> 00:31:23.825
I was looking through the catalog book

559
00:31:23.825 --> 00:31:28.242
and I came across this class
called Bluegrass Guitar.

560
00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:33.789
And that's when I really
started to understand

561
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:38.789
my place musically and how
I can contribute to music.

562
00:31:38.975 --> 00:31:40.818
And the fact that my ancestors

563
00:31:40.818 --> 00:31:44.697
were such a pivotal and important part

564
00:31:44.697 --> 00:31:46.780
of country and bluegrass.

565
00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:52.477
Like these are all things
I had no idea of because.

566
00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:54.685
for me. I didn't know if I wanted

567
00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:59.259
to be part of a music
community that. on the surface.

568
00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:03.017
didn't seem to recognize
me as a valid participant

569
00:32:03.017 --> 00:32:05.378
because I was black.

570
00:32:05.378 --> 00:32:08.461
(gentle banjo music)

571
00:32:18.743 --> 00:32:21.102
- Country music is the music of the South.

572
00:32:21.102 --> 00:32:23.852
It is Southern musical tradition.

573
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:30.281
And when you think about
the American South.

574
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:33.781
you gotta think about black people period.

575
00:32:38.221 --> 00:32:40.212
And all of these things that we hear

576
00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:43.459
that we associate with whiteness

577
00:32:43.459 --> 00:32:45.821
were absolutely being done

578
00:32:45.821 --> 00:32:49.725
and really being revolutionized really.

579
00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:53.296
like black people were really
innovating in this space.

580
00:32:53.296 --> 00:32:56.379
(gentle banjo music)

581
00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:05.092
- [Amythyst] There were
times where whites and blacks

582
00:33:05.092 --> 00:33:08.342
would both learn music from each other.

583
00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:10.839
There was like a trade

584
00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:14.509
between the banjo and
the fiddle. for instance.

585
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:16.195
The banjo coming from West Africa.

586
00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:19.362
(gentle banjo music)

587
00:33:21.837 --> 00:33:26.171
Adding that rhythmic playing.
which we call claw hammer.

588
00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:30.014
you're playing melody and
rhythm at the same time.

589
00:33:30.014 --> 00:33:32.823
So that going underneath
these fiddle tunes

590
00:33:32.823 --> 00:33:34.740
created this new sound.

591
00:33:37.924 --> 00:33:41.091
("Eighth of January")

592
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.294
- We've got black string bands

593
00:33:51.294 --> 00:33:52.636
along with white string bands.

594
00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:55.320
but white people were put in this bucket

595
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.920
where they create hillbilly music

596
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.098
and black people are over
here creating race records.

597
00:34:00.098 --> 00:34:03.098
("Warm Wipe Stomp")

598
00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:14.434
The music itself is the same.

599
00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:20.410
The genres are really
just marketing categories.

600
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:24.280
How do we get music in
the hands of these people?

601
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.950
♪ Warm wipe stomp ♪

602
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:30.708
- And it really is the
commercial music industry.

603
00:34:30.708 --> 00:34:33.818
this idea that now we're
gonna make money off of this

604
00:34:33.818 --> 00:34:36.985
that starts to create that separation.

605
00:34:40.314 --> 00:34:44.308
- Once more white people started
learning how to play banjo.

606
00:34:44.308 --> 00:34:46.506
there was this thing
that started happening

607
00:34:46.506 --> 00:34:48.818
in the early 20th century.

608
00:34:48.818 --> 00:34:49.937
The blackface minstrel shows.

609
00:34:49.937 --> 00:34:52.687
(intense music)

610
00:34:56.157 --> 00:34:58.720
And people from all over the country

611
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.479
would go and see these shows.

612
00:35:01.479 --> 00:35:02.767
That's how popular it was.

613
00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.517
(intense music)

614
00:35:06.385 --> 00:35:09.968
When you're faced with
being a black person

615
00:35:10.939 --> 00:35:14.785
during Segregation and
trying to find opportunities

616
00:35:14.785 --> 00:35:19.785
to just have some sense of
dignity in greater society.

617
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:23.797
You are not gonna gravitate
toward banjo or a fiddle

618
00:35:23.797 --> 00:35:26.958
because you're seeing yourself
portrayed so negatively.

619
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.931
Why would you wanna grab a banjo?

620
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:33.708
If anything. it's let's create
jazz. let's create blue.

621
00:35:33.708 --> 00:35:36.360
Let's create some other music now

622
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.110
that we can have that's our own.

623
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.110
because we can't touch this anymore.

624
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.509
- A lotta times. even as
the music starts to shift.

625
00:35:46.509 --> 00:35:48.904
as we see more blues coming to the fore.

626
00:35:48.904 --> 00:35:50.078
they don't even want black people

627
00:35:50.078 --> 00:35:52.590
doing this other stuff anymore.

628
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.186
They don't want the black string bands

629
00:35:54.186 --> 00:35:58.603
because that has been clearly
defined as white music.

630
00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:03.112
So over time we lose the
roots. which is that.

631
00:36:03.112 --> 00:36:04.400
yeah. white people were doin' it.

632
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.920
but black people were doin' it. too.

633
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.406
(gentle banjo music)

634
00:36:10.406 --> 00:36:13.323
- Every single bit of modern music.

635
00:36:15.284 --> 00:36:19.450
black roots music is foundational
to every single bit of it.

636
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.783
And just as black innovation. creativity

637
00:36:23.694 --> 00:36:26.317
is foundational to blues.

638
00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:27.648
it's just as much so to country.

639
00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:29.262
It's just as much so to folk.

640
00:36:29.262 --> 00:36:32.287
it's just as much so to
any kind of pop music.

641
00:36:32.287 --> 00:36:36.466
any kind of. obviously jazz.
obviously rock and roll.

642
00:36:36.466 --> 00:36:38.788
Like. there's no Elvis
without Sister Rosetta Tharpe.

643
00:36:38.788 --> 00:36:40.609
There's no Hank Williams
without Lead Belly.

644
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:44.088
There's no. it's like. it's foundational.

645
00:36:44.088 --> 00:36:46.626
And that's the part that
I started to realize.

646
00:36:46.626 --> 00:36:51.382
I don't need to apologize
for being in any space.

647
00:36:51.382 --> 00:36:54.549

(city noises)

672
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:24.830
- [Amanda] Country music
is unique in that it is

673
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.663
associated with a city. Nashville.

674
00:38:28.944 --> 00:38:31.120
And that's something you
don't see in other genres.

675
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.703
(somber music)

676
00:38:36.257 --> 00:38:37.122
People come here.

677
00:38:37.122 --> 00:38:40.955
they have a certain idea
of what Nashville is.

678
00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.438
They come with their cowboy
hats and their fringe

679
00:38:43.438 --> 00:38:44.771
and their boots.

680
00:38:46.328 --> 00:38:47.892
And they think that that's
how people live here

681
00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:51.059
and that it's a completely white city.

682
00:38:53.587 --> 00:38:57.170
when that has not been
the case in reality.

683
00:38:58.463 --> 00:39:01.046
(somber music)

684
00:39:06.391 --> 00:39:09.224
(people giggling)

685
00:39:12.034 --> 00:39:13.784
- [Kid] Bubble power.

686
00:39:15.163 --> 00:39:16.655
- No.
- That was a huge one.

687
00:39:16.655 --> 00:39:19.488
(voices muffling)

688
00:39:21.637 --> 00:39:24.883
- Try not to shake it. though.

689
00:39:24.883 --> 00:39:28.550
I remember when I was
probably like 12 or 13

690
00:39:29.387 --> 00:39:30.476
the "Achy Breaky Heart."

691
00:39:30.476 --> 00:39:31.733
(Niema laughing)

692
00:39:31.733 --> 00:39:32.685
It was the music.

693
00:39:32.685 --> 00:39:33.861
It was the tune that caught me.

694
00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:36.497
and I've always cherished the song.

695
00:39:36.497 --> 00:39:38.080
So Billy Ray Cyrus.

696
00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:41.597
I was a fan of his. when I was younger.

697
00:39:41.597 --> 00:39:44.162
I'm not afraid to say that now.

698
00:39:44.162 --> 00:39:47.395
but I've always loved country music.

699
00:39:47.395 --> 00:39:48.873
I've barely scratched the surface.

700
00:39:48.873 --> 00:39:52.427
but I'm always in the
mood to hear a good song.

701
00:39:52.427 --> 00:39:53.750
- Pop.
- Oh.

702
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.160
- Oh. baba.

703
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.272
- How you feel about it?

704
00:39:56.272 --> 00:39:57.940
(Niema laughing)

705
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.852
- You took my song. but yeah. I was in.

706
00:40:00.852 --> 00:40:02.720
I think second or third grade

707
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.470
when I heard "Achy Breaky Heart."

708
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:09.420
I mean. I didn't know at the
time that it was country.

709
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.983
because of being so young.

710
00:40:10.983 --> 00:40:13.414
you really don't separate
genres and everything.

711
00:40:13.414 --> 00:40:15.200
But. to this day.

712
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.650
I do know that that twang and that guitar

713
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.894
and the way that he was sayin' his words

714
00:40:20.894 --> 00:40:22.446
were definitely unforgettable.

715
00:40:22.446 --> 00:40:24.348
and that's country in a nutshell.

716
00:40:24.348 --> 00:40:26.931
(gentle music)

717
00:40:28.108 --> 00:40:32.941
I think country. for me
personally. me being a black male.

718
00:40:33.813 --> 00:40:37.646
it doesn't really call
out to me. I would say.

719
00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:39.492
It doesn't call out to me.

720
00:40:39.492 --> 00:40:41.407
It doesn't ask me to listen to it. per se.

721
00:40:41.407 --> 00:40:45.759
because I think that a
lot of the years over time

722
00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:48.806
have been catered to
another type of people.

723
00:40:48.806 --> 00:40:51.473
(gentle music)

724
00:41:01.775 --> 00:41:04.223
- It's tough because country music.

725
00:41:04.223 --> 00:41:08.439
when it strikes the ear it
don't sound like black music.

726
00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:09.272
You know what I'm saying?

727
00:41:09.272 --> 00:41:11.953
A lot of the iconography
surrounding country music.

728
00:41:11.953 --> 00:41:13.990
it's not how we dress.
it's not what we look like.

729
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.240
it's not what we talk like.

730
00:41:18.073 --> 00:41:20.162
We didn't listen to country
music growing up in my house.

731
00:41:20.162 --> 00:41:23.451
We was a jazz and gospel house.

732
00:41:23.451 --> 00:41:24.762
So it was just so strange.

733
00:41:24.762 --> 00:41:27.904
and it's like. everywhere
you go you're inundated with

734
00:41:27.904 --> 00:41:30.288
a ton of country music. and there's no.

735
00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:32.155
there was nothing else playing.

736
00:41:32.155 --> 00:41:34.380
If you're goin' to the gas
station. country music;

737
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.537
you go to the mall. country music;

738
00:41:35.537 --> 00:41:38.090
you go to a store. country music.

739
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.257
Everywhere you go it was
country music everywhere.

740
00:41:44.803 --> 00:41:47.319
- If you look at the
scholarship on country music.

741
00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:51.652
it's very well established
how country became white.

742
00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.904
But my question was really. okay.

743
00:41:54.904 --> 00:41:56.905
we know how it became white.

744
00:41:56.905 --> 00:41:59.797
but how has that
whiteness been maintained?

745
00:41:59.797 --> 00:42:02.258
Because here we are 100 years later.

746
00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:05.454
and we still think of
country music as white.

747
00:42:05.454 --> 00:42:09.704
probably even more white
than we did 100 years ago.

748
00:42:13.718 --> 00:42:16.420
Historically the country music industry

749
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.121
has really capitalized

750
00:42:18.121 --> 00:42:22.288
on finding a base audience
of white conservatives.

751
00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:26.757
And that is a pocket of consumers

752
00:42:26.757 --> 00:42:29.513
that doesn't exist across
the board elsewhere.

753
00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:32.180
(gentle music)

754
00:42:36.177 --> 00:42:38.978
By the late 1970s. as a nation.

755
00:42:38.978 --> 00:42:41.395
the U.S. really took a conservative turn.

756
00:42:41.395 --> 00:42:44.690
(gentle music)

757
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.357
The cowboy came back in fashion.

758
00:42:48.562 --> 00:42:51.079
And this was coupled with Ronald Reagan

759
00:42:51.079 --> 00:42:53.141
assuming the presidency in 1980.

760
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:56.559
and he sold himself as a cowboy.

761
00:42:56.559 --> 00:42:58.921
And in turn. the country music industry.

762
00:42:58.921 --> 00:43:00.435
and the CMA in particular.

763
00:43:00.435 --> 00:43:03.602
really leaned into those associations.

764
00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:08.958
(crowd cheering)

765
00:43:16.408 --> 00:43:17.512
- And I don't know about our opponents.

766
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:20.030
but there's an old
Country and Western song

767
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.769
called "Home on the Range."

768
00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:25.978
where seldom is heard a discouragin' word.

769
00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:27.729
I guess they haven't campaigned there yet.

770
00:43:27.729 --> 00:43:29.955
(audience laughing)

771
00:43:29.955 --> 00:43:32.205
You could invite them here.

772
00:43:33.047 --> 00:43:34.443
If you don't. that's just as well.

773
00:43:34.443 --> 00:43:38.526
(audience laughing and cheering)

774
00:43:46.136 --> 00:43:47.263
But they probably couldn't.

775
00:43:47.263 --> 00:43:49.332
they couldn't perform here anyway.

776
00:43:49.332 --> 00:43:51.139
because all they do is sing the blues.

777
00:43:51.139 --> 00:43:53.773
(audience laughing)

778
00:43:53.773 --> 00:43:56.440
(intense music)

779
00:44:00.029 --> 00:44:02.377
- [Amanda] By the 1990s. country music

780
00:44:02.377 --> 00:44:05.460
was the most popular format on radio.

781
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:11.878
And of course it all
funnels back to radio.

782
00:44:11.878 --> 00:44:14.916
because radio is the
most influential force

783
00:44:14.916 --> 00:44:17.749
within the country music business.

784
00:44:19.785 --> 00:44:21.467
It's across the board.

785
00:44:21.467 --> 00:44:23.349
within the country music industry

786
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:24.695
for the past several decades

787
00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:27.061
where every pocket of the industry

788
00:44:27.061 --> 00:44:30.561
is invested in a certain type of listener.

789
00:44:33.657 --> 00:44:35.910
It's building on
generations and generations

790
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.498
of only selling country music as a product

791
00:44:38.498 --> 00:44:40.435
by and for white people.

792
00:44:40.435 --> 00:44:43.768
(gentle intense music)

793
00:44:48.989 --> 00:44:51.433
- Part of the big reason why
country music is the way it is.

794
00:44:51.433 --> 00:44:55.510
is because of the fan.
the culture around it.

795
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:57.722
- [Reporter] Controversy
over the Confederate flag

796
00:44:57.722 --> 00:44:59.676
hits home here in Connecticut.

797
00:44:59.676 --> 00:45:01.956
- [Andrea] You cultivate
whiteness for a very long time.

798
00:45:01.956 --> 00:45:05.234
you're gonna get a certain
demographic of people.

799
00:45:05.234 --> 00:45:06.894
- I think individual freedoms.

800
00:45:06.894 --> 00:45:07.789
you don't wanna tramp on that.

801
00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:08.791
Don't tread on me.

802
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:11.791
(television static)

803
00:45:17.227 --> 00:45:22.037
- There's no denying the
tying in of Southern heritage

804
00:45:22.037 --> 00:45:25.620
to what traditional
country music has been.

805
00:45:27.817 --> 00:45:30.841
I was a day-to-day manager
for a couple country artists

806
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.591
for about nine years.

807
00:45:33.955 --> 00:45:36.199
I mean. I remember goin' to concerts.

808
00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:37.233
You pull in the parking lot

809
00:45:37.233 --> 00:45:39.463
and you see all the Confederate flags.

810
00:45:39.463 --> 00:45:43.757
and those people might
not be actively racist.

811
00:45:43.757 --> 00:45:45.570
but they're at a country music show.

812
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.681
and they feel like that means

813
00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:49.383
that they should fly the Confederate flag.

814
00:45:49.383 --> 00:45:52.460
(gentle music)

815
00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.161
If you're not workin'
in the music industry

816
00:45:54.161 --> 00:45:56.337
or you don't have a
real reason to be there.

817
00:45:56.337 --> 00:46:01.337
you're only gonna put yourself
through that experience once.

818
00:46:02.797 --> 00:46:06.158
I think all of it
together has just sort of

819
00:46:06.158 --> 00:46:10.325
made this not so welcoming
space for black people.

820
00:46:12.843 --> 00:46:14.883
And so I think that's
why it hurts even more.

821
00:46:14.883 --> 00:46:17.431
'cause it's hard to see
this thing that you love

822
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:19.407
and work so hard for.

823
00:46:19.407 --> 00:46:21.766
it's hard to feel like
it doesn't love you back.

824
00:46:21.766 --> 00:46:24.349
(gentle music)

825
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:30.253
- [Andrea] Even as it sits in the heart

826
00:46:30.253 --> 00:46:35.086
of this very diverse city. the
city that is a third black.

827
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:40.494
this city with this rich
civil rights history.

828
00:46:41.499 --> 00:46:44.166
Where the freedom riots started.

829
00:46:45.313 --> 00:46:48.549
Where you've got Alexander
Looby's house is bombed

830
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:51.312
because of the work he's
doing to desegregate schools

831
00:46:51.312 --> 00:46:54.895
to fight for civil
rights for black people.

832
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.027
Where there are four HBCUs in town.

833
00:46:59.027 --> 00:47:01.694
(gentle music)

834
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:07.799
There has been this
constant shift away from

835
00:47:07.799 --> 00:47:11.092
or avoidance of or just really clear lines

836
00:47:11.092 --> 00:47:15.837
between this industry and the
black community that's here.

837
00:47:15.837 --> 00:47:18.504
(gentle music)

838
00:47:29.828 --> 00:47:34.411
- I am a lifelong resident.
69 years here in Nashville.

839
00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:40.439
I grew up listening to country music.

840
00:47:40.439 --> 00:47:43.209
My mother was a choreographer.

841
00:47:43.209 --> 00:47:45.468
so she always listened to music.

842
00:47:45.468 --> 00:47:49.208
and having grown up
basically on a big farm

843
00:47:49.208 --> 00:47:51.979
and going to hoedowns and square dancing.

844
00:47:51.979 --> 00:47:54.740
I still have the silver dollars that I won

845
00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:57.789
in the square dancing contest
when I was a little boy.

846
00:47:57.789 --> 00:48:01.625
So. country music. two
step. square dancing.

847
00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:04.292
it's what I've done all my life.

848
00:48:07.496 --> 00:48:09.079
I was born in 1952.

849
00:48:11.467 --> 00:48:14.800
Of course. it was a different Nashville.

850
00:48:16.345 --> 00:48:19.229
My first time going to the Grand Ole Opry.

851
00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:23.749
I had to sit up in the top
because it was segregated.

852
00:48:23.749 --> 00:48:26.332
(somber music)

853
00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:37.412
So I never felt that country
music was welcoming me.

854
00:48:40.201 --> 00:48:42.237
And so if I didn't feel
it was welcoming me.

855
00:48:42.237 --> 00:48:46.049
and I've been loving it all my life.

856
00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:47.824
then I can only imagine how people

857
00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.514
who don't have any connection

858
00:48:49.514 --> 00:48:51.467
or people who even were trying to get

859
00:48:51.467 --> 00:48:53.879
in the business would feel.
because they weren't there.

860
00:48:53.879 --> 00:48:56.462
(somber music)

861
00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:03.535
So it caused me to dig a little deeper.

862
00:49:03.535 --> 00:49:06.618
to try to get a better understanding.

863
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:09.846
And the fact is that.

864
00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:13.763
as Nashville was not
welcoming back in the day.

865
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:16.759
country music wasn't either.

866
00:49:16.759 --> 00:49:19.426
(gentle music)

867
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.770
(dog barking)

868
00:49:28.287 --> 00:49:30.821
- When I moved here. it was 1981.

869
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:33.821
and it was quite different than now.

870
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.590
There were tour buses everywhere.

871
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.779
Busloads of people would come

872
00:49:39.779 --> 00:49:43.333
into these different clubs or restaurants.

873
00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:45.559
and they would have these jam sessions.

874
00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:48.247
and everybody wanted to get up

875
00:49:48.247 --> 00:49:52.019
and have a picture made singing
on a stage in Nashville.

876
00:49:52.019 --> 00:49:55.214
There was one particular jam
session I was interested in.

877
00:49:55.214 --> 00:49:57.464
was in the Captain's Table.

878
00:49:58.508 --> 00:50:00.266
I studied the marquee and it said

879
00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:03.190
Sammy Davis Jr. had performed there.

880
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.440
and I love Sammy Davis. Jr.

881
00:50:06.367 --> 00:50:09.903
And so I said. I'm gonna be
clean when I walk up in there.

882
00:50:09.903 --> 00:50:12.570
(gentle music)

883
00:50:17.382 --> 00:50:20.425
So I come down Church Street one night

884
00:50:20.425 --> 00:50:25.083
in my evening gown with my
little fake rhinestones on.

885
00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:28.631
and the cops stopped me and
said. "Where you goin'?"

886
00:50:28.631 --> 00:50:31.623
I said. "I'm going to the jam session

887
00:50:31.623 --> 00:50:34.229
"at the Captain's Table."

888
00:50:34.229 --> 00:50:35.791
And he said. "To do what?"

889
00:50:35.791 --> 00:50:37.493
I said. "I'm singin' Loretta Lynn."

890
00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.891
He said. "Oh. really?

891
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:40.739
"I'm going with you."

892
00:50:40.739 --> 00:50:42.271
I said. "You wanna hear it?

893
00:50:42.271 --> 00:50:43.104
"Come on."

894
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:48.861
So my entree into the jam
session was with the police.

895
00:50:50.752 --> 00:50:52.331
And I was the first one there.

896
00:50:52.331 --> 00:50:54.115
I signed up at 11:30 at night.

897
00:50:54.115 --> 00:50:56.032
It started at midnight.

898
00:50:56.872 --> 00:50:59.131
And he just kinda hung
around a few minutes

899
00:50:59.131 --> 00:51:00.918
and gave his card to the manager. said.

900
00:51:00.918 --> 00:51:03.842
"If you have any problems
with her. let me know."

901
00:51:03.842 --> 00:51:06.598
I thought. why would they
have any problems with me?

902
00:51:06.598 --> 00:51:09.045
I'm just here for the music.

903
00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:10.573
I was drinkin' black coffee.

904
00:51:10.573 --> 00:51:13.648
I was the first one to sign up.

905
00:51:13.648 --> 00:51:16.866
And busloads of people came and went.

906
00:51:16.866 --> 00:51:18.684
and they got all them up to sing.

907
00:51:18.684 --> 00:51:21.364
They wouldn't get me up. and
I thought. I'm not leavin'.

908
00:51:21.364 --> 00:51:22.828
I'm staying.

909
00:51:22.828 --> 00:51:25.466
If we have to have a sunrise service here.

910
00:51:25.466 --> 00:51:27.728
I'm stayin' till the sun comes up.

911
00:51:27.728 --> 00:51:30.395
(gentle music)

912
00:51:32.961 --> 00:51:34.120
And so I just sat there.

913
00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.037
and 2:30 in the morning. they said.

914
00:51:38.948 --> 00:51:41.948
"You know. we don't know this woman.

915
00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:46.900
"but this is a jam session
that's open to the public.

916
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.626
"So we're gonna get
her up to sing a song."

917
00:51:50.626 --> 00:51:52.645
"And her name is Frankie Stratton."

918
00:51:52.645 --> 00:51:55.966
I said. "My name is Frankie Staton."

919
00:51:55.966 --> 00:51:57.203
And I go up there and I say.

920
00:51:57.203 --> 00:52:01.837
"I'm doin' the 'Coal Miner's
Daughter' in the key of D."

921
00:52:01.837 --> 00:52:03.672
And I turn around and tell the audience.

922
00:52:03.672 --> 00:52:06.905
and the place is still packed
at 2:30 in the mornin'.

923
00:52:06.905 --> 00:52:09.217
that I came to Nashville
because of this movie.

924
00:52:09.217 --> 00:52:10.269

925
00:52:10.269 --> 00:52:12.173

They said. "Well. sing another song."

929
00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:20.588
And I sang another song.

930
00:52:20.588 --> 00:52:23.017
And they said. "Well. sing another song."

931
00:52:23.017 --> 00:52:27.413

I always wanted to get
a chance to talk to you.

958
00:53:59.032 --> 00:54:01.411
When I was small my mom and
dad were in the music business.

959
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:02.858
and I just kinda grew up in it.

960
00:54:02.858 --> 00:54:05.170
But did you always wanna be a singer

961
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:06.240
from the time you were a little boy?

962
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.116
Or did you just kind of-

963
00:54:07.116 --> 00:54:08.220
- I've sang all my life.

964
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.027

great baseball player.

- And you know. it's a
strange thing on the radio.

and I had 10 minutes on the show.

998
00:55:21.454 --> 00:55:23.298
I drove all the way from Montana.

They're sittin' there goin'

00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:43.960
when they were still hangin'

1056
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.647
and hosin' black peoples in the streets.

1057
00:57:45.647 --> 00:57:47.230
in the 60s and 70s.

1058
00:57:48.284 --> 00:57:49.117
And he was there.

1059
00:57:49.117 --> 00:57:52.091
He was there for a long
time at a high level.

1060
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:55.260
He showed that it could be done.

1061
00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:59.406
♪ And prayer it works yeah ♪

1062
00:57:59.406 --> 00:58:02.739
♪ So God bless this day ♪

1063
00:58:13.777 --> 00:58:16.277
(city noises)

1064
00:58:18.722 --> 00:58:21.719
- We've seen throughout
history that representation

1065
00:58:21.719 --> 00:58:23.494
in and of itself is not enough.

1066
00:58:23.494 --> 00:58:27.065
or Charley Pride would
have fixed everything.

1067
00:58:27.065 --> 00:58:28.824
There have always been moments

1068
00:58:28.824 --> 00:58:32.027
where you see this kind
of push of black artists

1069
00:58:32.027 --> 00:58:36.776
trying to get in. but then
ultimately being shut out.

1070
00:58:36.776 --> 00:58:38.824
Charley Pride becomes
this massive success.

1071
00:58:38.824 --> 00:58:40.091
Of course other black people

1072
00:58:40.091 --> 00:58:42.761
think that this is my opportunity.

1073
00:58:42.761 --> 00:58:45.228
but the walls came down pretty quickly

1074
00:58:45.228 --> 00:58:47.095
because there could only be one.

1075
00:58:47.095 --> 00:58:50.395
(intense music)

1076
00:58:50.395 --> 00:58:53.895
- Everyone told us to go to Charley Pride.

1077
00:58:55.525 --> 00:58:56.666
Oh. you wanna get a
break in country music?

1078
00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:57.627
Go to Charley Pride.

1079
00:58:57.627 --> 00:59:01.467
And I never could understand
why they did that.

1080
00:59:01.467 --> 00:59:04.859
But basically it was to
get us out of their face.

1081
00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:08.460
You're black in the country.
oh go find Charley Pride.

1082
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.443
Well. why. did he have they label?

1083
00:59:09.443 --> 00:59:10.708
Was he lookin' for talent?

1084
00:59:10.708 --> 00:59:12.180
No.

1085
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.597
You're the label.

1086
00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:17.838
It solidified the powers that be

1087
00:59:21.076 --> 00:59:24.067
the ability to say. "We're not prejudice.

1088
00:59:24.067 --> 00:59:25.206
"We have a Charley Pride.

1089
00:59:25.206 --> 00:59:28.671
"We have a black man in country music."

1090
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:32.502
Now I'm gonna quote Dr.
Cleve Francis on this.

1091
00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:35.971
He said. "What 30 some
million black people

1092
00:59:35.971 --> 00:59:37.477
"shook the country music tree

1093
00:59:37.477 --> 00:59:40.560
"and one brother fell out in 75 years

1094
00:59:42.742 --> 00:59:46.915
"when I know there were many more trying."

1095
00:59:46.915 --> 00:59:49.998
(low rumbling music)

1096
01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:10.659
- I'm a member of a oratorical people.

1097
01:00:10.659 --> 01:00:14.659
We tell stories from the
beginning through song.

1098
01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:20.864
through poem. and I think
our story's gotta be honored.

1099
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:25.955
It's kinda hard to find country music

1100
01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:30.853
from black artists in Nashville
that are from Nashville.

1101
01:00:30.853 --> 01:00:32.186
that are really.

1102
01:00:33.042 --> 01:00:34.341
that are really reflecting who we are.

1103
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:37.285
And I feel like if there was more that

1104
01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:41.702
it would totally change my
perspective of the music.

1105
01:00:42.819 --> 01:00:44.113
Our story's gotta be honored.

1106
01:00:44.113 --> 01:00:46.030
and it's gotta be held.

1107
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.900
held with the degree of
authenticity and respect

1108
01:00:52.034 --> 01:00:55.909
in order for it to
resonate with the people.

1109
01:00:55.909 --> 01:00:58.909
(light banjo music)

1110
01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.381
- Places like these are important.

1111
01:01:07.381 --> 01:01:09.171
because this is really where we start

1112
01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:11.921
to see the music merged together.

1113
01:01:12.852 --> 01:01:14.867
black musicians. white musicians.

1114
01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:17.123
like you see a lotta old pictures

1115
01:01:17.123 --> 01:01:18.966
where you got guys that
are playin' the banjo.

1116
01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:21.590
black musicians. they're
doing it in these settings.

1117
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.475
They're entertaining white crowds.

1118
01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:26.070
(gentle banjo music)

1119
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:27.497
These settings are so indicative

1120
01:01:27.497 --> 01:01:29.389
of what is happening in country music.

1121
01:01:29.389 --> 01:01:31.023
what has been happening country music.

1122
01:01:31.023 --> 01:01:34.957
because we're standing on
a place of stolen labor.

1123
01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.766
We look at the industry
now that is birthed

1124
01:01:36.766 --> 01:01:39.356
out of these black genres.
these black musical traditions.

1125
01:01:39.356 --> 01:01:41.724
and it's really stolen from our people.

1126
01:01:41.724 --> 01:01:43.789
because they don't get to participate

1127
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:47.693
in the wealth that's being built here now.

1128
01:01:47.693 --> 01:01:50.223
And you can't separate the industry

1129
01:01:50.223 --> 01:01:51.853
that comes out of this place

1130
01:01:51.853 --> 01:01:54.925
without talking about the
ugliness of this place.

1131
01:01:54.925 --> 01:01:58.008
(gentle banjo music)

1132
01:01:59.244 --> 01:02:01.116
- I had always been apologizing. almost.

1133
01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:02.413
for being in these spaces.

1134
01:02:02.413 --> 01:02:04.074
where I was always the one black person

1135
01:02:04.074 --> 01:02:05.613
in these very white...

1136
01:02:05.613 --> 01:02:09.200
And people like. "Why
aren't you singin' jazz?"

1137
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.302
I was constantly being
asked to explain myself.

1138
01:02:11.302 --> 01:02:13.302
"Why are you doing this?

1139
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.003
"Why are you doing this music."

1140
01:02:18.093 --> 01:02:18.926
- First and foremost.

1141
01:02:18.926 --> 01:02:21.282
music is about how it makes you feel.

1142
01:02:21.282 --> 01:02:25.573
regardless of what you look
like or where you grew up.

1143
01:02:25.573 --> 01:02:30.573
For me as a kid. I really
struggled with feeling in between.

1144
01:02:31.301 --> 01:02:34.884
I'm either not white.
I'm not black enough.

1145
01:02:35.992 --> 01:02:37.430
I'm in the middle of all of this.

1146
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.582
tryin' to figure out who I am.

1147
01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:41.573
and when I discovered this
history and this music.

1148
01:02:41.573 --> 01:02:46.406
that's when I was like. this
is what makes me an American.

You can't just sit down

Black people and white people

A song and music has this
way of disarming people.

1159
01:03:26.323 --> 01:03:30.139
It takes a story or an
idea and makes it to where

01:07:11.918 --> 01:07:12.993
Arguably.

1208
01:07:12.993 --> 01:07:17.300
We have never seen a song in
the internet era this big.

1209
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.373
And it's not just that the song is big.

1210
01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:22.040
It's big and it's controversial.

1211
01:07:22.915 --> 01:07:24.037
- [Announcer] And let
me tell you right now.

1212
01:07:24.037 --> 01:07:26.550
it's a country song. so
make some noise right now.

1213
01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:28.042
- It wasn't controversial to me.

1214
01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:28.875
I was like. that's dope.

1215
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.742
But I'm saying it was
controversial to some people.

(voice muffling)

1217
01:07:34.982 --> 01:07:36.115

1218
01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:38.778

and it was like.

1223
01:07:46.311 --> 01:07:49.811
I used it on a song. and the song blew up.

1224
01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.429
- You know how it goes.

1225
01:07:52.429 --> 01:07:53.262

1227
01:07:56.165 --> 01:07:59.301
- [Reporter] 2019 Officially
belongs to Lil Nas X.

1228
01:07:59.301 --> 01:08:02.100
- That song became the longest
running number one single

1229
01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.933
in Billboards history.

1230
01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:09.071
- I like Nas X. though.
- That song. that song.

1231
01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:10.933
He came out with a good song.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1232
01:08:10.933 --> 01:08:12.674
- He caught it at the beginning.

1233
01:08:12.674 --> 01:08:15.417
He wasn't even around country music.

1234
01:08:15.417 --> 01:08:18.235
So he had to prove himself

1235
01:08:18.235 --> 01:08:20.535
who he really was so he

1236
01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:23.702
can be respected out here as a person.

1237
01:08:25.096 --> 01:08:28.953
- What he did was such
a shock to the world.

1238
01:08:28.953 --> 01:08:30.250
and to the country music world.

1239
01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.872
especially once he came out.

1240
01:08:32.872 --> 01:08:33.851
and then it was like. okay.

1241
01:08:33.851 --> 01:08:36.987
so we have this young gay black dude.

1242
01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:40.345
and he's got Billy Ray on the song.

1243
01:08:40.345 --> 01:08:42.555
- I mean. the impact was huge.

1244
01:08:42.555 --> 01:08:43.597
Song went freakin' diamond.

1245
01:08:43.597 --> 01:08:45.773
You know what I'm sayin'?

1246
01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:49.463
It opened people's eyes and ears up that

1247
01:08:49.463 --> 01:08:50.937
we can do it all.

1248
01:08:50.937 --> 01:08:54.441
We can do whatever. it's no limitations.

1249
01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:57.500
Especially when it comes to creativity.

1250
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.665
Like. it's none.

1251
01:08:58.665 --> 01:09:00.457
And with "Old Town Road."

1252
01:09:00.457 --> 01:09:02.202
it definitely opened up. like I said.

1253
01:09:02.202 --> 01:09:05.065
people's eyes and ears to be like. oh.

1254
01:09:05.065 --> 01:09:07.732
there's black people doin' this?

1255
01:09:09.559 --> 01:09:13.142
- As a kid growing up.
what that role model

1256
01:09:14.012 --> 01:09:15.281
that we talkin' about-
- A lotta kids

1257
01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:16.430
are listenin' to that song.

1258
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.319
- Yeah. yeah. so you know you need

1259
01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.902
some positive role model around

1260
01:09:22.031 --> 01:09:24.766
to hear something positive to say.

1261
01:09:24.766 --> 01:09:26.686
"Hey. I can do that."

1262
01:09:26.686 --> 01:09:29.353
(gentle music)

1263
01:09:44.328 --> 01:09:47.811
- Lil Nas X (voice
muffling) "Old Town Road."

1264
01:09:47.811 --> 01:09:48.888
(voice muffling)

1265
01:09:48.888 --> 01:09:51.688
And a couple days ago it
just reached number one.

1266
01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:53.411
The song made Billboard chart history.

1267
01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:57.422
It's the only song to simultaneously
appear on the Hot 100.

1268
01:09:57.422 --> 01:09:59.891
the Hot R&B Hip Hop Songs Chart.

1269
01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:02.460
and the Hot Country Songs Chart.

1270
01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.359
- But now Billboard has pulled it

1271
01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:07.938
from the country songs chart
because they no longer believe

1272
01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:09.529
that the song is country enough.

1273
01:10:09.529 --> 01:10:11.670
(television static)

1274
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.948
- People were mad.

1275
01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:16.302
People were mad. and I'm
like. I was just watching it.

1276
01:10:16.302 --> 01:10:18.922
and I'm like. I wonder
what they're gonna do.

1277
01:10:18.922 --> 01:10:21.172
Are they gonna boycott him?

1278
01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:24.597
So I was just really fascinated by it.

1279
01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:26.630
I followed the whole thing.

1280
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.371
And then when I saw kind of how
it started to resolve itself

1281
01:10:29.371 --> 01:10:32.593
and people were like.
"Well. why can't he do it?"

1282
01:10:32.593 --> 01:10:34.488
Obviously that song was massive.

1283
01:10:34.488 --> 01:10:37.679
And then he dropped some more music

1284
01:10:37.679 --> 01:10:40.179
that was not like that at all.

1285
01:10:41.448 --> 01:10:43.974
And I was like. wait.
but people like this.

1286
01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:46.391
I was like. people like that.

1287
01:10:47.855 --> 01:10:51.772
Then I was like. okay.
well. why can't I do it?

1288
01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:55.977
- There's no genre that sounds today

1289
01:10:55.977 --> 01:11:00.977
like it sounded 10 years ago.
20 years ago. 30 years ago.

1290
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:04.187
As we've seen in country
music throughout the years.

1291
01:11:04.187 --> 01:11:06.481
as the sonics have changed.

1292
01:11:06.481 --> 01:11:09.539
there is this constant
borrowing from other genres.

1293
01:11:09.539 --> 01:11:11.289
from other sounds.

1294
01:11:11.289 --> 01:11:13.876
There is borrowing from
gospel. from black gospel.

1295
01:11:13.876 --> 01:11:15.907
There's borrowing from black R&B.

1296
01:11:15.907 --> 01:11:17.331
Now we're in this era where there's

1297
01:11:17.331 --> 01:11:20.513
a lot of borrowing from hip hop.

1298
01:11:20.513 --> 01:11:24.262
It all evolves. and that
creates more of an opportunity

1299
01:11:24.262 --> 01:11:27.285
to bring in people from outside of this.

1300
01:11:27.285 --> 01:11:29.532
particularly when the artist

1301
01:11:29.532 --> 01:11:31.470
that is doing this genre blending

1302
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.720
looks like a Breland or a Blanco Brown.

1303
01:11:37.129 --> 01:11:39.406
- Lil Nas had to take some Ls

1304
01:11:39.406 --> 01:11:42.089
as a young black man in this space.

1305
01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:46.148
and I don't blame him for not
wanting to stay in this space.

1306
01:11:46.148 --> 01:11:48.599
However. by him doing that.

1307
01:11:48.599 --> 01:11:52.682
he made it easier for
me to do what I'm doing.

1308
01:11:52.682 --> 01:11:54.036
♪ Scuff these Jordans ♪

1309
01:11:54.036 --> 01:11:55.846
♪ You can say you hate me ♪

1310
01:11:55.846 --> 01:11:57.443
♪ You can call me crazy ♪

1311
01:11:57.443 --> 01:12:00.360

01:12:05.632 --> 01:12:08.882
♪ Don't touch my truck ♪

1315
01:12:10.521 --> 01:12:12.780
I put it out in September of '19.

1316
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.323
and randomly in December
someone hit me up and was like.

1317
01:12:15.323 --> 01:12:17.740
"Yo. your song is on TikTok."

1318
01:12:19.184 --> 01:12:20.485
And I went and checked. and I was like.

1319
01:12:20.485 --> 01:12:24.561
every minute there was
new videos being made.

1320
01:12:24.561 --> 01:12:27.273
It put up like 200 videos in like a day.

1321
01:12:27.273 --> 01:12:30.063
And I was like 200
people made videos to it?

1322
01:12:30.063 --> 01:12:31.353
And then I went and checked the numbers.

1323
01:12:31.353 --> 01:12:33.674
and we were at like 30.000 streams.

1324
01:12:33.674 --> 01:12:35.581
And I was like. oh. we just spiked crazy.

1325
01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:37.491
I was like. this is dope.

1326
01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:38.697
And then every day after that.

1327
01:12:38.697 --> 01:12:40.905
it was just like going
more and more and more.

1328
01:12:40.905 --> 01:12:43.042
And about a week after that.

1329
01:12:43.042 --> 01:12:45.448
I started getting calls from labels.

1330
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:47.122
and they were like.

1331
01:12:47.122 --> 01:12:49.318
they're like. "Hey. you're an artist?

1332
01:12:49.318 --> 01:12:51.400
"You're Breland the artist?"

1333
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.817
And I was like. "I guess so."

1334
01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.141
And they're like. "We
wanna meet with you."

1335
01:12:56.141 --> 01:12:58.664
And I'm like. the first
couple calls that I got.

1336
01:12:58.664 --> 01:13:00.419
I was like. all right. sure.

1337
01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:03.146
But then I got calls from
like 15 different major labels

1338
01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.689
in a 24-hour span (laughing).

1339
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:08.975
And I was like. oh. this
is for real. for real.

1340
01:13:08.975 --> 01:13:11.860
- Your song. "My Truck." was very popular.

1341
01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:14.865
So popular. in fact. that
I have a surprise for you.

1342
01:13:14.865 --> 01:13:17.519
So on behalf of Bad Realm Records-

1343
01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.833
- Oh y'all. oh no.

1344
01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:22.107
(Kelly laughing and clapping)
- No. oh no.

1345
01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:24.277
- So wait. on behalf of Bad Realm Records

1346
01:13:24.277 --> 01:13:25.703
and Atlantic Records.

1347
01:13:25.703 --> 01:13:28.121
we wanna present you with
a platinum certification-

1348
01:13:28.121 --> 01:13:28.954
- Don't do me

1349
01:13:28.954 --> 01:13:29.787
like that. Kelly.
- For selling

1350
01:13:29.787 --> 01:13:30.697
one million copies of "My Truck."

1351
01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:32.291
which is hard to do right now. y'all.

1352
01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:33.791
That's incredible.

1353
01:13:36.216 --> 01:13:40.291
- I just knew there was
a lane that was open.

1354
01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.957
and if the lane is open for
one. it's open for everybody.

1355
01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:47.957

1363
01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:33.464
I feel like music is my
life. it's everything.

1364
01:14:35.942 --> 01:14:37.225
It's never been a question.

1365
01:14:37.225 --> 01:14:38.371
like. what do I wanna do?

1366
01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:40.288
What will my career be?

1367
01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:46.152
I've always just been like.
I'm going to make history.

1368
01:14:46.152 --> 01:14:47.131
I'm going to be a singer.

1369
01:14:47.131 --> 01:14:49.798
and I'm going to do what I love.

1370
01:14:52.123 --> 01:14:54.603
When people ask me why did
I choose country music.

1371
01:14:54.603 --> 01:14:57.162
I just tell them country music chose me.

1372
01:14:57.162 --> 01:14:57.995
That's how I feel.

1373
01:14:57.995 --> 01:15:01.377
(gentle music)

1374
01:15:01.377 --> 01:15:04.333
I've only been in Nashville
for two or three years.

1375
01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.445
(gentle music)

1376
01:15:06.445 --> 01:15:08.974
They haven't seen a lot of
black women or black men

1377
01:15:08.974 --> 01:15:11.372
in the country space.

1378
01:15:11.372 --> 01:15:12.756
And so. because of that.

1379
01:15:12.756 --> 01:15:16.133
they don't know what to expect from me.

1380
01:15:16.133 --> 01:15:17.853
I feel like especially
being in country music

1381
01:15:17.853 --> 01:15:20.783
I kinda have to be aware
of everything that I do.

1382
01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:24.297
but I'm just like. I'm gonna be me.

1383
01:15:24.297 --> 01:15:27.773
And for me. I'm like. I wanna
be as extra as possible.

1384
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:28.779
Like that's just me.

1385
01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:31.446
(intense music)

1386
01:15:36.794 --> 01:15:39.181
(piano music)

1387
01:15:39.181 --> 01:15:40.330
- Oh yeah. I'll do freestylin'.

1388
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.830
(piano music)

1389
01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:48.468
Country music was so simple
to me. and it told stories.

1390
01:15:48.468 --> 01:15:50.163
You didn't have to create a facade.

1391
01:15:50.163 --> 01:15:53.964
You just could tell
whatever story you wanted.

1392
01:15:53.964 --> 01:15:56.964
And I just. I gravitated towards it.

1393
01:15:57.994 --> 01:16:02.053
You gotta create your own path
and go for your own glory.

1394
01:16:02.053 --> 01:16:04.781
So. couldn't nobody tell
me what I couldn't do.

1395
01:16:04.781 --> 01:16:06.562
I was gonna keep on doin'
it either way it go.

1396
01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.603
If it didn't work.

1397
01:16:07.603 --> 01:16:12.502
I'm great with listening to
myself goin' down the highway.

1398
01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:16.530
- In 2018. I realized I
would never fit the mold.

1399
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.384
I stopped asking myself if
something was good enough

1400
01:16:19.384 --> 01:16:22.298
or radio enough. commercial enough.

1401
01:16:22.298 --> 01:16:23.860
I started asking. is this me?

1402
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.867
Is this who I am?

1403
01:16:24.867 --> 01:16:26.171
Is this what I wanna do?

1404
01:16:26.171 --> 01:16:28.531
Am I communicating my heart?

1405
01:16:28.531 --> 01:16:30.561
And that for me was the most freeing thing

1406
01:16:30.561 --> 01:16:34.645
that could have ever
happened to me artistically.

1407
01:16:34.645 --> 01:16:37.312
- Whenever you are makin' music.

1408
01:16:38.563 --> 01:16:42.426
and in particular. if you
have dreads and you're black.

1409
01:16:42.426 --> 01:16:45.493
then (laughing) people
automatically assume things.

1410
01:16:45.493 --> 01:16:46.968
like I'll be walkin' through the airport

1411
01:16:46.968 --> 01:16:48.985
in some random city and people be like.

1412
01:16:48.985 --> 01:16:50.333
"Oh. I love your hair.

1413
01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:51.538
"Oh. you have a guitar.

1414
01:16:51.538 --> 01:16:53.119
"Are you gonna do reggae?"

1415
01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:58.112
And I'm like. "Oh. I love
reggae. but no I'm not."

1416
01:16:58.112 --> 01:17:00.902
Makin' life easier would be conforming

1417
01:17:00.902 --> 01:17:04.390
to what people would see me do physically.

1418
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:05.986
But I do what I do.

1419
01:17:05.986 --> 01:17:08.032
I do what my heart tells me.

1420
01:17:08.032 --> 01:17:10.065
And I sound like I sound.

1421
01:17:10.065 --> 01:17:11.651
And I don't feel like
I wanna spend my time

1422
01:17:11.651 --> 01:17:12.937

This music thing that everyone

openin' the doors up because
this music is amazin'.

1495
01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.894
I felt like I could shine
a light on this genre.

1496
01:21:01.894 --> 01:21:04.895
and say. listen. we don't
have to just do this.

1497
01:21:04.895 --> 01:21:06.374
We can move out to the country.

1498
01:21:06.374 --> 01:21:09.983
We can be out here with horses and cows.

1499
01:21:09.983 --> 01:21:13.037
You could be where the air is clean.

1500
01:21:13.037 --> 01:21:15.125
So it's deep in my heart. and say. listen.

1501

we can enjoy this dream.

1502
01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:20.011
We can enjoy this life.

1503
01:21:20.011 --> 01:21:24.231
And you can make music
in these environments.

1504
01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:26.241
about these environments.

1505
01:21:26.241 --> 01:21:28.059
And you can just sit and write a song

1506
01:21:28.059 --> 01:21:30.600
and sing a song with nothing.

1507
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.576

sit outside and be like.

1508

I don't need anything.

1509
01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:37.449
I could sit here and I
could write a hit song.

01:22:56.764 --> 01:22:59.678
My whole experience in the music industry.

1529
01:22:59.678 --> 01:23:01.893
I wished that there were
more people of color

1530
01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:04.560
to sing the songs I was writin'.

1531
01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:10.797
because there's a different
way that we sing sometimes.

1532
01:23:10.797 --> 01:23:14.464
There's a different way
that soul comes out.

1533
01:23:17.894 --> 01:23:21.737
The experiences of being black in America.

1534
01:23:21.737 --> 01:23:25.658
that puts something in your soul deep down

1535
01:23:25.658 --> 01:23:29.351
to where you sing the
song a little different.

1536
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:31.934
(gentle music)

1537
01:23:39.035 --> 01:23:41.952
- I do think that there is a shift.

1538
01:23:43.826 --> 01:23:48.076
There's a shift in
consciousness that has occurred.

1539
01:23:49.266 --> 01:23:51.516
Starting with the lockdown.

1540
01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:55.960
all of the abuses that have always gone on

1541
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.012
that continued to go on.

1542
01:23:57.012 --> 01:23:59.845
but which were filmed and absorbed

1543
01:24:01.743 --> 01:24:03.451
in people's psyches and their emotions

1544
01:24:03.451 --> 01:24:06.702
in a deeper way than ever
before in my lifetime.

1545
01:24:06.702 --> 01:24:09.452
(crowd chanting)

1546
01:24:12.309 --> 01:24:14.682
Nashville is a part of a whole macrocosm

1547
01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:17.523
that I think there is a
wave of change happening

1548
01:24:17.523 --> 01:24:22.523
in a sustained way that I
have not witnessed in my life.

1549
01:24:22.607 --> 01:24:23.847
- [Reporter] That truth
earned Mickey Guyton

1550
01:24:23.847 --> 01:24:25.998
her first ever Grammy nomination

1551
01:24:25.998 --> 01:24:29.225
for her deeply personal
song. "Black Like Me."

1552
01:24:29.225 --> 01:24:32.126
making Mickey the first
black female solo artist ever

1553
01:24:32.126 --> 01:24:34.098
to earn a nod in a country music category.

1554
01:24:34.098 --> 01:24:35.669
- Now you are headin' into the weekend

1555
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:37.294

1556
01:24:37.294 --> 01:24:39.856
of course. that is for New
Male Artist of the Year.

1557
01:24:39.856 --> 01:24:43.618
You are the first black
musician to do that.

1558
01:24:43.618 --> 01:24:45.155
- This weekend Mickey Guyton

1559
01:24:45.155 --> 01:24:47.821
will become the first
black woman to co-host

1560
01:24:47.821 --> 01:24:50.021
the Academy of Country Music Awards.

1561
01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:51.430
She was the only black woman

1562
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:53.760
to be nominated for an award this year.

1563
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.634
But as Amna Nawaz reports.

1564
01:24:55.634 --> 01:24:57.122
a number of black women

1565
01:24:57.122 --> 01:25:01.479
are starting to gain
traction in the genre.

1566
01:25:01.479 --> 01:25:05.261
- When I started meeting Reyna
Roberts and Kären McCormick

1567
01:25:05.261 --> 01:25:07.994
and Camille Parker and Mickey Guyton.

1568
01:25:07.994 --> 01:25:11.234
I just started feelin'
like. oh. this is a thing.

1569
01:25:11.234 --> 01:25:12.067
This is happening.

1570
01:25:12.067 --> 01:25:13.484
It's not just me.

1571
01:25:14.969 --> 01:25:17.523
There is a shift happening.

1572
01:25:17.523 --> 01:25:20.084
There is a whole new sound comin'.

1573
01:25:20.084 --> 01:25:23.031
and it's not to take
place of something else.

1574
01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:24.564
We just wanna join the story.

1575
01:25:24.564 --> 01:25:27.147
(gentle music)

1576
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:36.732
- No matter how many
different ways I sang.

1577
01:25:37.676 --> 01:25:40.824
mo matter what makeup you put on me.

1578
01:25:40.824 --> 01:25:42.824
I'm still a black woman.

1579
01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:48.005
And that's never going to change.

1580
01:25:48.005 --> 01:25:52.684
And I have to be who I am and
love that and accept that.

1581
01:25:52.684 --> 01:25:55.271
And when I got to that place. it was.

1582
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:58.805
it almost makes me teary
eyed to even talk about.

1583
01:25:58.805 --> 01:26:01.149
but it was truly one of
the most freeing things

1584
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:03.178
I could have ever done for myself.

1585
01:26:03.178 --> 01:26:05.761
(gentle music)

1586
01:26:11.763 --> 01:26:15.135
There's so many amazing
things happening for me.

1587
01:26:15.135 --> 01:26:19.830
but there is so much sadness
because I do know too much.

1588
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:22.401
(gentle music)

1589
01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:24.559
I know entirely too much.

1590
01:26:24.559 --> 01:26:27.559

(television clicking)

1605
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.871
I've been in town for years.

1606
01:27:28.871 --> 01:27:30.903
and it took a song like "Black Like Me"

1607
01:27:30.903 --> 01:27:34.236
and a man dying for people to notice me.

1608
01:27:35.446 --> 01:27:37.492
How do you celebrate that?

1609
01:27:37.492 --> 01:27:40.742
(gentle intense music)

1610
01:27:42.526 --> 01:27:44.696
There are times. even to this day.

1611
01:27:44.696 --> 01:27:47.608
where I still question if I have a home

1612
01:27:47.608 --> 01:27:50.191
within the country music genre.

1613
01:27:53.021 --> 01:27:54.649
And I just have to be honest.

1614
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:58.085
(gentle intense music)

1615
01:27:58.085 --> 01:28:01.335
I don't always feel like I have a home.

1616
01:28:02.275 --> 01:28:04.275
But I'm creating a home.

1617
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:08.208
And I hope I'm creating a space

1618
01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:10.600
for other people of color and black people

1619
01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.753
to feel like they have
a home in this genre.

1620
01:28:12.753 --> 01:28:17.753
(gentle music)
(curtain clicking)

1621
01:28:25.539 --> 01:28:27.724
- It's gonna be difficult
to have conversations

1622
01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:31.454
about what we need to do or whether

1623
01:28:31.454 --> 01:28:34.277
there's actual hope and movement right now

1624
01:28:34.277 --> 01:28:38.694
when it ain't been this lit
in Nashville in a minute.

1625
01:28:40.958 --> 01:28:43.748
All these articles and that
hasn't happened in a while.

1626
01:28:43.748 --> 01:28:48.415
So if you're a part of that.
if you're ridin' that wave.

1627
01:28:53.031 --> 01:28:54.457
everything's too good right now.

1628
01:28:54.457 --> 01:28:57.040
(gentle music)

1629
01:28:58.442 --> 01:29:01.212
- It's almost come
every generation. right?

1630
01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:03.290
Where been these moments in time

1631
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:06.700
when commercially speaking
there was potential there

1632
01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.744
to maybe be hopeful that something

1633
01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:11.827
was gonna change within the industry.

1634
01:29:13.103 --> 01:29:13.954
It's a business.

1635
01:29:13.954 --> 01:29:17.195
And it's a business that does
very. very well for itself.

1636
01:29:17.195 --> 01:29:19.348
which makes me cynical because.

1637
01:29:19.348 --> 01:29:21.609
from their perspective as a business

1638
01:29:21.609 --> 01:29:24.668
where the goal is to make money.
not to do the right thing.

1639
01:29:24.668 --> 01:29:26.590
there really isn't an incentive to change.

1640
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:29.173
(gentle music)

1641
01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:33.607
- We're doin' a lotta talking
and a lotta discussing.

1642
01:29:33.607 --> 01:29:37.035
which is great. and which
is a wonderful first step.

1643
01:29:37.035 --> 01:29:41.452
But I have yet to see a lot
of action against racism.

1644
01:29:46.988 --> 01:29:51.497
- [Andrea] We're seeing
kinda surface level things.

1645
01:29:51.497 --> 01:29:53.560
Some organizations in town that

1646
01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.690
as they cultivate the list of who's next.

1647
01:29:56.690 --> 01:30:01.558
they're making sure there's
black faces on there.

1648
01:30:01.558 --> 01:30:03.880
The CMAs and the ACMs they're. okay.

1649
01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.599
we don't wanna have another award show

1650
01:30:05.599 --> 01:30:07.121
where there are no black people.

1651
01:30:07.121 --> 01:30:08.621
That is happening.

1652
01:30:12.192 --> 01:30:15.011
- But there's no consequences.

1653
01:30:15.011 --> 01:30:16.918
There's not a lot of
action of people saying

1654
01:30:16.918 --> 01:30:19.918
we are not going to do this anymore.

1655
01:30:21.475 --> 01:30:26.140
There's a lot of dismantling
that needs to be done.

1656
01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.390
I think if one artist says.

1657
01:30:29.275 --> 01:30:32.900
"I don't want Confederate
flags at my show."

1658
01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.067
and that rule is followed.

1659
01:30:36.217 --> 01:30:37.302
it can't even be expressed

1660
01:30:37.302 --> 01:30:41.302
what a difference that
will make moving forward.

1661
01:30:46.262 --> 01:30:48.179
- Nashville is growing.

1662
01:30:49.702 --> 01:30:52.369
and Nashville is getting better.

1663
01:30:54.042 --> 01:30:57.777
but I have not seen that same growth

1664
01:30:57.777 --> 01:31:00.277
in the country music industry.

1665
01:31:01.296 --> 01:31:03.235
And I'm startin' to see it now.

1666
01:31:03.235 --> 01:31:06.909
but it makes me wonder is
it cause of what's going on

1667
01:31:06.909 --> 01:31:08.786
in our society right now?

1668
01:31:08.786 --> 01:31:12.393
Or is it because they finally get it

1669
01:31:12.393 --> 01:31:14.829
and understand that the
country music industry

1670
01:31:14.829 --> 01:31:18.329
will be better if it becomes more diverse?

1671
01:31:24.038 --> 01:31:28.038
- It's gonna take a lot
to change country music.

1672
01:31:29.630 --> 01:31:32.995
It's gotta be people behind the scenes.

1673
01:31:32.995 --> 01:31:36.412
people at record labels. people in radio.

1674
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:42.130
It's gonna take a lot to change
and it's gonna take time.

1675
01:31:44.681 --> 01:31:47.503
- We need to own the infrastructure.

1676
01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:49.670
and we need to have black executives

1677
01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.958
and black business owners

1678
01:31:51.958 --> 01:31:54.714
when it comes to the music business.

1679
01:31:54.714 --> 01:31:56.559
I think that's what changes it.

1680
01:31:56.559 --> 01:31:57.646
It's not just opportunity.

1681
01:31:57.646 --> 01:32:00.250
because opportunity just
gives you the chance

1682
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.520
to operate within the
parameters that's already set

1683
01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.644
before you walk in the door.

1684
01:32:05.644 --> 01:32:08.561
but power gives you the opportunity

1685
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:11.300
to do something pure.

1686
01:32:14.599 --> 01:32:17.281
If we could change that.
if we could hold power.

1687
01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:19.198
I think that's the key.

1688
01:32:22.802 --> 01:32:24.149
- It's cool to be able to be in a position

1689
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:27.573
to where I can help other artists.

1690
01:32:27.573 --> 01:32:31.619
because I wouldn't be here
without people helpin' me.

1691
01:32:31.619 --> 01:32:33.916
I feel like if I. as a black man.

1692
01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:35.574
had kind of pushed
through in this industry

1693
01:32:35.574 --> 01:32:40.162
because people believed in
me. only signed white artists.

1694
01:32:40.162 --> 01:32:44.155
I don't feel like that's
why I was placed here.

1695
01:32:44.155 --> 01:32:46.192
And I feel like if I see
other people of color

1696
01:32:46.192 --> 01:32:49.383
that are strugglin' but talented.

1697
01:32:49.383 --> 01:32:52.383
I feel like it's my job to help 'em.

1698
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:56.203
- We literally all have to

1699
01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:59.378
be having this conversation
with each other.

1700
01:32:59.378 --> 01:33:02.263
Like. hey. did you do
everything that you could today

1701
01:33:02.263 --> 01:33:04.838
or this week or this month or this year

1702
01:33:04.838 --> 01:33:07.733
to help make this space more equitable.

1703
01:33:07.733 --> 01:33:08.975
more fair for everybody?

1704
01:33:08.975 --> 01:33:10.725
Did you do your part?

1705
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:16.461
It means very little to
me to win a CMA. a Grammy.

1706
01:33:16.461 --> 01:33:19.391
a Billboard Award. have a
number one. or any of that.

1707
01:33:19.391 --> 01:33:22.195
if I'm not able to do
anything for the people

1708
01:33:22.195 --> 01:33:24.778
who are also trying to do that.

1709
01:33:25.794 --> 01:33:28.323
How can we help black
people win in this space?

1710
01:33:28.323 --> 01:33:30.990
And how can we help everyone else

1711
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:32.366
who's already been in this space

1712
01:33:32.366 --> 01:33:34.383
and has benefited from those systems.

1713
01:33:34.383 --> 01:33:38.103
how can we help them understand
what's happening here.

1714
01:33:38.103 --> 01:33:40.361
and so that they can also be a part of it?

1715
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:41.194
And I think if we're able

1716
01:33:41.194 --> 01:33:42.973
to accomplish both of those things.

1717
01:33:42.973 --> 01:33:47.390
then we can achieve real
inclusivity and real equity.

1718
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:54.189
- There has to be not just one
or two or three black people

1719
01:33:54.273 --> 01:33:57.543
that go on to have successful careers

1720
01:33:57.543 --> 01:34:01.374
every 25 years or something like that.

1721
01:34:01.374 --> 01:34:05.124
There has to be several
black country artists

1722
01:34:06.752 --> 01:34:08.835
that have viable careers.

1723
01:34:09.957 --> 01:34:14.097
And we have to walk through
that door together as a whole.

1724
01:34:14.097 --> 01:34:17.321
as a unit. arm-in-arm.
through these doors.

1725
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:20.995
and saying. "Hey. we're
here and we're talented.

1726
01:34:20.995 --> 01:34:23.245
"And we deserve to be here.

1727
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.587
"Our dreams are valid."

1728
01:34:28.653 --> 01:34:31.754
- There's no pushing the tide back.

1729
01:34:31.754 --> 01:34:35.330
There's no turning the
river the other way.

1730
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:37.707
It's that long arc of justice.

1731
01:34:37.707 --> 01:34:40.294
It's long and slow and
we're not there yet.

1732
01:34:40.294 --> 01:34:44.377
but I do hope and believe
that we will get there.

1733
01:34:45.888 --> 01:34:48.599
- It's a very exciting time for Nashville.

1734
01:34:48.599 --> 01:34:52.157
And I have great hopes for this city.

1735
01:34:52.157 --> 01:34:55.990
I've been here 40 years.
seen a lotta changes.

1736
01:34:57.494 --> 01:35:00.003
I have a lotta hope for this generation.

1737
01:35:00.003 --> 01:35:03.024
which has certainly went
further than anyone I've seen.

1738

1739
01:35:06.174 --> 01:35:09.150

how to work together.

Where can you go if you
don't have a platform?

That's what I would love
to see happen in Nashville.

1748
01:35:38.025 --> 01:35:40.596

1749
01:35:40.596 --> 01:35:42.117
