00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:31.379
Now squeeze
the icing from the bottom.

4
00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:36.166
Then ever so lightly
just glide along.

5
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.689
That's right.

6
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.214
- So who taught you
how to do this. Daddy?

7
00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:41.563
- My dad.

8
00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.391
And someday you'll
teach our children.

9
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.222
One day this'll be yours. Sadie.

10
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.095
- Only if that's what she wants.

11
00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:54.576
You can be anything
you want. Sadie.

12
00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.753
A doctor. a lawyer.
or a scientist.

13
00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:59.581
The sky's the limit.

14
00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:02.366
Maybe you'll
be an astronaut.

15
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.631
- I wanna be a great
chocolatier. just like Daddy.

16
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.534
Sadie.

17
00:01:39.577 --> 00:01:41.101
- Maggie. you wanted to see me?

18
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:42.276
- Come on in. Sit down.

19
00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:48.978
We heard back from the client.

20
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.414
You did?

21
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:52.721
- They were very positive.
They love your new ideas.

22
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.681
But they decided to
stick with last year's campaign.

23
00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:00.337
- They said they
wanted something fresh.

24
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:03.123
- Apparently. fresh meant
a new font or new colors.

25
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.909
Hmm. I know it's disappointing.

26
00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:08.998
You put a lot of time
into that project.

27
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.958
- I can come up with
something different.

28
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:15.918
- You did a great job. They're
just not ready for a change.

29
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:21.967
So are you going away
for the holidays?

30
00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:24.361
- No. I'm staying here.

31
00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:27.234
I mean. not here but in town.

32
00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:30.628
So if you need anything.
I'm 100% available.

33
00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.282
- That's what I like to hear.

34
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.070
Merry Christmas. Sadie.

35
00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:38.941
- You too.

36
00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:43.641
- Maybe once a year or so.

37
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:44.381
And...

38
00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:45.252
Oh. sorry.

39
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:50.648
Hello.

40
00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.520
Michael. are
you at the airport?

41
00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:55.871
- No. I'm stuck at this
Christmas work thing. You know?

42
00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:57.960
- Can't you just sneak out?

43
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.180
- Wish I could. but
it's a sit-down dinner.

44
00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:01.050
Can't just leave.

45
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.880
- You're gonna miss your flight.

46
00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:06.664
I can't help it.

47
00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:10.929
- Should I check
flights for tomorrow?

48
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:12.888
- No. no. don't do that.

49
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:14.933
I was thinking I
might just stay.

50
00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:17.371
It's actually kind of nice
here during the holidays.

51
00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:19.547
- But we made plans.

52
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.899
- Oh. I know. but
work's been so busy

53
00:03:23.942 --> 00:03:26.554
and you know. I could
really use some time off.

54
00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:27.381
You get it.

55
00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:29.557
- No. I know. I've
been busy too.

56
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.386
but I made my plans around you.

57
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.736
- Oh. I hate that.

58
00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:37.739
But I think this is best.

59
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.178
When I get back in the
States. I'll give you a call.

60
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.048
- Okay?

61
00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:45.616
- I gotta get back to the party.

62
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.575
- I thought you said
it wasn't a party.

63
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.535
- Can't hear you.
Merry Christmas. Sadie.

64
00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:57.106
- You too.

65
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.075
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.773
- You take off early?

67
00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:13.427
- There wasn't much
going on today.

68
00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:17.257
- Are you gonna eat the
rest of the Thai food?

69
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:19.128
- No. go ahead.

70
00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:21.739
I need to finish packing.

71
00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.265
- What? Why?

72
00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:27.745
- I'm going home.

73
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:29.704
For what?

74
00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:33.142
- 'Cause Michael's staying
in Europe for the holidays.

75
00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:35.144
So there's no reason
for me to stay.

76
00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:36.014
You're leaving.

77
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.626
- I can't believe he did that.

78
00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:43.631
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:45.807
- Don't be.

80
00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:48.113
He's not the one.

81
00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:49.724
He made that very clear.

82
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:52.161
Early new year's resolution.

83
00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:54.381
no waiting around for
boys to act like men.

84
00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.166
- Agreed. No more
waiting around.

85
00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:01.170
- Are you gonna wear this?

86
00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:05.870
- It's a gift from
my mom.

87
00:05:05.914 --> 00:05:07.829
My boss said they
really liked my ideas.

88
00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:10.310
but they're sticking with
what they already have.

89
00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:13.487
- At least I liked your ideas.

90
00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:15.967
- Doesn't matter
if you don't win.

91
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:18.187
It's like a participation award.

92
00:05:20.058 --> 00:05:21.799
- I'm never using
their products again.

93
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:24.802
- Thanks.

94
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.025
- Are you leaving
tomorrow morning?

95
00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:32.027
- Yep. Only one flight left.

96
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.769
- Good. That means we can
open presents tonight.

97
00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:37.424
- You're gonna love your
matching Christmas sweater.

98
00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.407
- Oh. do you remember this one?

99
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:07.410
I think it was third
or was it fourth grade?

100
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:09.238
- I remember making this.

101
00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.895
- I'm so glad you made it home.

102
00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:17.289
- Decorating the tree without
you just isn't the same.

103
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.248
- And I thought you'd
already have enough by now.

104
00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.859
- Yeah. well. every year
Christmas comes quicker

105
00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.861
or I'm getting slower.

106
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:26.908
- Has the shop been busy.

107
00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:30.651
- That time of year.

108
00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:33.044
- I could help out if
you want? I have time.

109
00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:34.829
- That would be great.

110
00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:39.921
- Your dad wants to
tell you something.

111
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:41.575
- What is it?

112
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.796
- Well. we didn't wanna
tell you over the phone.

113
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.104
- I don't like the way I look
on his face calls.

114
00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:51.759
- What's wrong? Are you okay?

115
00:06:57.808 --> 00:06:59.897
- We sold the place.
We're retiring.

116
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:01.943
- You're kidding?

117
00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:03.423
- It's exciting isn't it?

118
00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:06.948
- But you're not old.
Why would you retire?

119
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:08.558
You love it.

120
00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:11.909
- That's sweet. But we are
older than we used to be.

121
00:07:11.953 --> 00:07:15.739
- That's what I thought.
but Alex made us an offer.

122
00:07:15.783 --> 00:07:16.914
- Just because
someone wants to buy

123
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.003
doesn't mean you have to sell.

124
00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:21.092
- Oh. honey. we don't
wanna work forever.

125
00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:22.616
- Your mother wants to travel.

126
00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.966
Before we get
too old to enjoy it.

127
00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:26.881
- You remember my friend Harry?

128
00:07:26.924 --> 00:07:29.579
He retired and he
plays golf every day.

129
00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:31.929
- But you've never
once played golf.

130
00:07:31.973 --> 00:07:33.975
- Exactly. Now
I'll have the time.

131
00:07:34.018 --> 00:07:35.542
- And we'll be
able to visit you.

132
00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:38.370
- You never know
when an opportunity

133
00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:39.633
like this'll come again.

134
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:44.594
- I just can't imagine
us without Annedore's.

135
00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:46.161
Especially this time of year.

136
00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:49.512
- You should meet him.

137
00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:50.426
- You'll like him.

138
00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:53.342
Come
by in the morning.

139
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:55.475
- Yeah. maybe.

140
00:07:56.867 --> 00:07:58.782
You're happy I'm
home. aren't you?

141
00:08:09.314 --> 00:08:12.230
What are you gonna do
while Dad's playing golf?

142
00:08:12.274 --> 00:08:15.059
- Hmm. Maybe I'll
take up a new hobby.

143
00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:17.061
- Next time I come home.
you'll be doing yoga.

144
00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.020
and Dad's gonna be
wearing white shoes.

145
00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:25.766
- Sadie. you know we didn't
make this decision lightly.

146
00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:28.899
Annedore's is like
part of our family

147
00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:31.946
and I know it feels like that

148
00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:33.991
we're handing her
off to a stranger.

149
00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:37.429
- Who's the stranger?

150
00:08:37.473 --> 00:08:40.520
- Alex Mitchell. He's very nice.

151
00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:43.914
Think you will like him.

152
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.525
You just gotta
give him a chance.

153
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.484
- I'm meeting Taylor first
thing in the morning.

154
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.573
I can stop by after that.

155
00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:51.705
- That's a great idea.

156
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:54.534
You want some more sprinkles?

157
00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:55.839
You don't have any sprinkles.

158
00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:58.581
- Yes. please. I think
it's sprinkle time.

159
00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:16.904
We're decorating the Christmas
tree and all of a sudden.

160
00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:18.732
they basically said.
"Merry Christmas.

161
00:09:18.775 --> 00:09:20.777
"we've sold your
childhood memories."

162
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:23.084
- I don't think you
can sell memories.

163
00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:28.916
- How could they sell
Annedore's without telling me?

164
00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:31.440
- They probably knew
how you'd react.

165
00:09:32.963 --> 00:09:35.096
- Thought it was
going to be mine.

166
00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:37.925
- Maybe they thought you
weren't interested anymore.

167
00:09:37.968 --> 00:09:40.101
You did move away.

168
00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:41.755
- I'm still part of the family.

169
00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:46.107
- So you'd move back
and take over the store?

170
00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:51.895
- I don't know. but
I'd like to be asked.

171
00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:52.940
So tell them.

172
00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:56.247
- Why? It's already done.

173
00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.556
- You thought you were spending
Christmas in California.

174
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.646
but here you are with me.

175
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.215
When I was a kid.

176
00:10:08.695 --> 00:10:11.088
I thought I was going to
work at Annedore's forever.

177
00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:14.222
When did things
get so complicated?

178
00:10:15.223 --> 00:10:17.051
- I think it's called
being an adult.

179
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:23.100
- I have to go and
meet Mr. Scrooge.

180
00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:25.189
who's stealing Christmas.

181
00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:28.932
- Scrooge was stingy. He
didn't steal Christmas.

182
00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:30.064
- That's why I
didn't like playing

183
00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:33.154
Christmas trivia
with you.

184
00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:36.244
- Well. call me and we'll
go Christmas shopping.

185
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:36.984
- I will.

186
00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:44.252
- Oh!

187
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:10.191
- You don't think
he saw that. do you?

188
00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:12.541
Probably not.

189
00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:14.761
Maybe.

190
00:11:15.936 --> 00:11:17.764
Who cares? You'll
never see him again.

191
00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:21.419
- Oh my gosh.

192
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.313
- Sadie. you made it.

193
00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:48.969
- I think I miss the smell
of chocolate most of all.

194
00:11:49.012 --> 00:11:50.274
- Oh.

195
00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:52.799
Well. I'm gonna sneak
in just for the smell.

196
00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:54.191
I can't go cold turkey.

197
00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.238
- Where's Ebenezer?

198
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:58.108
- What?

199
00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:59.240
The buyer.

200
00:11:59.283 --> 00:12:02.199
- Oh. Alex? He's not in yet.

201
00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:04.462
- He obviously
doesn't have any idea

202
00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:06.421
what it takes to make chocolate.

203
00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:08.379
The early mornings.
the late nights.

204
00:12:08.423 --> 00:12:10.904
- Try to be nice. He's learning.

205
00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:13.602
- I will. but he needs to
know what he's getting into.

206
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:15.082
It's only fair.

207
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.866
Morning.

208
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.781
- Good morning. Alex.

209
00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:20.914
Alex. I'd like you to
meet my daughter. Sadie.

210
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:22.263
Sadie. Alex.

211
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:24.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.268
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

213
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:29.749
I've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

214
00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:31.925
Your dad goes on and on.

215
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:33.187
- He has?

216
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.536
- Yes.

217
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:37.060
And I think Sadie would
be the perfect person

218
00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:38.670
to finish your training. Alex.

219
00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.455
She was just reminding
me of a few things

220
00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:41.848
she thought you
might need to know.

221
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.631
Right. Sadie?

222
00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.111
- Me? No.

223
00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:45.808
It's been so long.

224
00:12:45.852 --> 00:12:48.289
I don't think I should be
teaching anyone anything.

225
00:12:48.332 --> 00:12:49.725
- Don't be silly.

226
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.596
You can make a perfect
truffle in your sleep.

227
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.122
- Well. I'm a willing student.

228
00:12:57.907 --> 00:12:59.039
- Fine.

229
00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:01.171
Where do we start?

230
00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:04.479
- Well. do you know what it
takes to be a chocolatier?

231
00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:06.307
- Chocolate.

232
00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:10.137
- Yes. And commitment.

233
00:13:10.964 --> 00:13:12.443
- Okay.

234
00:13:12.487 --> 00:13:14.837
- It's long hours. not just
when the store is open.

235
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:17.840
you have to be here early.
and you're here late.

236
00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:19.842
Do you think you're up to that?

237
00:13:19.886 --> 00:13:22.410
- Well. I had to travel
a lot for my last job.

238
00:13:22.453 --> 00:13:25.456
So as long as I could
just sleep in my own bed.

239
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.283
I'll be fine.

240
00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:31.375
- People don't realize.
chocolate's not
all fun and games.

241
00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:33.334
It's a lot of work.

242
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:34.335
- I'm ready.

243
00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:39.688
- A lot of these recipes

244
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.211
were handed down
from my grandfather.

245
00:13:42.386 --> 00:13:43.997
So I wouldn't want them
to be given to someone

246
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.348
that doesn't realize just
how special they are.

247
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:49.524
They took years to perfect.

248
00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:51.352
- I realize.

249
00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:52.788
- There are plenty
of competitors

250
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.921
that would like to get
their hands on our recipes.

251
00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:58.489
- I will guard them
with my life. Okay?

252
00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:03.538
I mean. not literally.
obviously. but I'll
keep them safe.

253
00:14:04.452 --> 00:14:05.018
- Do you know anything?

254
00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.804
- About chocolate?

255
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:11.198
- Yes. about chocolate.

256
00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:14.375
- You know. so far.
your dad's just shown me

257
00:14:14.418 --> 00:14:15.550
the business side of things.

258
00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:20.163
So. no. but I'm a fast learner.

259
00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:22.383
- It's not a race.

260
00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:23.950
You don't learn chocolate fast.

261
00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:25.821
- Right.

262
00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:31.522
- We'll start with truffles.

263
00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:33.394
- Like mushrooms?

264
00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:35.744
- Let's start at
the very beginning.

265
00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:37.006
- Works for me.

266
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.399
- Chocolate truffles
got their name

267
00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:40.270
because they resemble
a very expensive fungus

268
00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:42.055
found in Italy and France.

269
00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:45.580
- And truffle sounds a lot
more appetizing than fungus.

270
00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.540
- The chocolate truffle was
discovered by accident really.

271
00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:52.152
The assistant for a French
chef accidentally spilled

272
00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:56.460
hot cream into a bowl of
expensive chopped chocolate.

273
00:14:56.504 --> 00:14:58.810
He was very angry. but
when he stirred it.

274
00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:02.075
it became a sauce. and
when it cooled it hardened.

275
00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:05.208
He worked the chocolate
paste with his hands

276
00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:08.908
until it formed a bumpy
walnut-sized ball.

277
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.780
And he rolled it in cocoa powder

278
00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:13.956
and it looked a
lot like a truffle.

279
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.610
And that's where
they got their name.

280
00:15:23.444 --> 00:15:24.575
- Now. it's your turn.

281
00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:28.797
Here it goes nothing.

282
00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:35.456
- You know. your parents said
you were a natural at this.

283
00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:37.545
I don't think they
were exaggerating.

284
00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.243
- I grew up watching my father.

285
00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:41.636
I knew how to make chocolates

286
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.420
before I knew how
to tie my shoe.

287
00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:45.466
At least. that's
what they tell me.

288
00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:49.122
- I understand why you
wouldn't want me here.

289
00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:51.472
- What?

290
00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:52.603
- I don't blame you.

291
00:15:52.647 --> 00:15:54.475
I mean. you're
teaching me something

292
00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:56.999
that you've known how
to do your entire life.

293
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:59.610
only for me to take
it away from you.

294
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:02.483
- You're not taking
anything away from me.

295
00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:04.964
- Okay. Guess I was wrong.

296
00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:08.619
- I'm happy for them.
Why wouldn't I be?

297
00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:11.448
- Nailed it.

298
00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:13.276
What's next.

299
00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:15.583
- That. again.

300
00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:19.065
- You're tougher than you look.

301
00:16:19.108 --> 00:16:20.022
- Do you wanna
learn this online?

302
00:16:20.066 --> 00:16:22.677
- No. No. definitely not.

303
00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:25.680
I'm kidding. Show me
one more time. please.

304
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.991
- You can't skimp
on the chocolate.

305
00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:34.994
You have to chop the
pieces really fine.

306
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.345
Once you mix it with the cream.

307
00:16:38.388 --> 00:16:41.174
wait for it to cool.
and roll it into balls.

308
00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:42.523
Got it?

309
00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:43.480
- Got it.

310
00:16:43.524 --> 00:16:44.829
- Now we can move on.

311
00:16:46.483 --> 00:16:47.397
- Okay.

312
00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:54.796
So how did today go?

313
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.538
- A little bumpy
with Alex today.

314
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.020
She's concerned he's
not serious enough.

315
00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.718
No one's
serious enough for Sadie.

316
00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:08.679
- First. she gave him the
complete history of the truffle.

317
00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:12.466
I'm not sure
he needs that much detail.

318
00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:15.686
Did she get around to
showing him how to make them?

319
00:17:17.123 --> 00:17:19.212
- You should have seen her.

320
00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:20.474
It was like she never left.

321
00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:45.716
- Thanks.

322
00:17:47.936 --> 00:17:51.592
- I hear your dad coerced you
into working with Alex today.

323
00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:55.074
- You said to be supportive.
So I'm being supportive.

324
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.379
- What'd you think of him?

325
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.427
Change is never easy.

326
00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:03.430
- It's gonna be weird.

327
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:05.693
No Annedore's.

328
00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:08.565
Seriously. what
are you gonna do?

329
00:18:09.436 --> 00:18:10.741
- I don't know.

330
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:13.004
Maybe we'll get one of
those big motorhomes

331
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:14.484
and travel all over.

332
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:18.314
Just see where the
wind blows us.

333
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:20.055
- You really want
this. don't you?

334
00:18:22.188 --> 00:18:24.581
- Annedore's is just
one piece of our life.

335
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.453
It's not our entire identity.

336
00:18:27.584 --> 00:18:28.629
And now it's over.

337
00:18:30.718 --> 00:18:31.458
- I guess so.

338
00:18:33.024 --> 00:18:35.592
- I'm excited to see what
the next chapter looks like.

339
00:18:36.854 --> 00:18:39.074
- You're right. I've only
been thinking about me.

340
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:39.988
not you and Dad.

341
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:44.993
- And I'm sorry things with
Michael didn't turn out.

342
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.474
but I'm glad you're here.

343
00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:49.563
- Me too.

344
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:52.479
- It's gonna be a
great Christmas.

345
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.746
We should have a
party. A retirement party.

346
00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:01.052
- We don't need to add one
more thing to the list.

347
00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:02.663
- I know. but we
have to celebrate

348
00:19:02.706 --> 00:19:05.448
what you and Dad have
done. and what comes next.

349
00:19:05.492 --> 00:19:07.058
- That's very thoughtful. Sadie.

350
00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:09.191
- We can have it
on Christmas Eve.

351
00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:11.498
We used to have people over
on Christmas Eve all the time.

352
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:14.370
- But Christmas Eve
is only a week away.

353
00:19:14.414 --> 00:19:17.025
- I'll take care of
everything. I promise.

354
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:24.206
- Sounds like you have
your mind made up.

355
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.339
Just like when you
were a little girl.

356
00:19:27.644 --> 00:19:28.689
Night. honey.

357
00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:30.430
- Night.

358
00:19:54.758 --> 00:19:55.977
Morning.

359
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.761
You're here
early this morning.

360
00:19:57.805 --> 00:20:00.199
- Chocolate doesn't
make itself. sir.

361
00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:01.548
- Very funny.

362
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:04.551
- No. it's not. I take
chocolate very seriously.

363
00:20:04.594 --> 00:20:07.554
- I may have been a tad
bit harsh yesterday.

364
00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:10.252
- I'm just surprised you
showed up at all today.

365
00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:12.515
I figured you had
better things to do

366
00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:16.737
with your Christmas vacation.
then spend it here with me.

367
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.999
- That's where you're wrong.

368
00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:19.827
I have absolutely
nothing better to do.

369
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:22.699
You know what I mean.

370
00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:26.268
- There's nowhere
else you'd rather be?

371
00:20:26.312 --> 00:20:29.358
- Well. I could go Christmas
shopping if you prefer?

372
00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:30.272
It's up to you.

373
00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:32.100
- No. please. stay.

374
00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:34.537
- Okay.

375
00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:35.582
I thought we could start with
peanut brittle this morning

376
00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:37.584
and then move on to toffee.

377
00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:39.063
- Okay.

378
00:20:39.107 --> 00:20:40.804
- We only make peanut
brittle around the holidays.

379
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:42.458
but everyone loves.

380
00:20:42.502 --> 00:20:44.721
- So why not keep it
in stock all year?

381
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:45.635
- We like to keep what we make

382
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:47.158
to a limited number of items.

383
00:20:47.202 --> 00:20:49.944
that way we can make
everything in-store.

384
00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:51.902
- So why not outsource it then?

385
00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:55.341
- Because that's
not how we do it.

386
00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:58.561
- Did you ever hear the story
of the girl who asked her mom

387
00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:01.172
why she cut the ends off of
her ham before she cooked it?

388
00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:02.652
- No.

389
00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:04.393
- Well. her mom
said it's because

390
00:21:04.437 --> 00:21:05.742
that's how her mother did it.

391
00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:07.440
So she called her mom

392
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:09.442
and asked her why she cut
the ends off of her ham?

393
00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:10.791
And her mother said

394
00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:13.228
she didn't have a pot
big enough to cook it in.

395
00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:16.492
- Well. have you ever
heard the saying.

396
00:21:16.536 --> 00:21:18.277
if it ain't broke. don't fix it?

397
00:21:19.843 --> 00:21:22.324
- Touche. Carry on.

398
00:21:22.368 --> 00:21:23.325
- Okay.

399
00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:24.935
Are we done telling stories?

400
00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:27.111
- If I find a few ways
to help the bottom line.

401
00:21:27.155 --> 00:21:28.765
I don't think that's a crime.

402
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:34.118
- Okay. Forget peanut brittle.
someone else will make that.

403
00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:35.598
How do you feel about toffee?

404
00:21:35.642 --> 00:21:37.470
- Feel great about it.

405
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:38.297
- Okay.

406
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:43.650
- Both caramel and toffee

407
00:21:43.693 --> 00:21:46.000
are a process of
caramelizing the sugar.

408
00:21:46.043 --> 00:21:48.132
That's where you get
that smoky taste.

409
00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:50.613
- And caramel is chewier. right?

410
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:51.788
- You cook toffee at
a higher temperature.

411
00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:53.442
That's what makes it crunchy.

412
00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:58.839
Now we let that cool.

413
00:21:58.882 --> 00:22:00.014
and then we can cut
it into squares.

414
00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:01.624
and dip it in milk
or dark chocolate.

415
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:03.670
- Mm. dark chocolate.
Definitely.

416
00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:05.367
That's my favorite.

417
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:06.150
- Mine too.

418
00:22:08.588 --> 00:22:10.154
Throwing a party for my parents

419
00:22:10.198 --> 00:22:12.026
to celebrate their retirement.

420
00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:14.507
It's Christmas Eve.
You should come.

421
00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:16.987
- Really?

422
00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:18.989
- You are the reason
they're retiring.

423
00:22:19.947 --> 00:22:21.949
And you can bring
someone if you want?

424
00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:26.388
- Okay. well. do you need me
to bring any food or anything?

425
00:22:26.432 --> 00:22:29.391
- No. I'm hiring a caterer
and I'm making the dessert.

426
00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:32.612
- Well. if you change your
mind. I make a mean toffee.

427
00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:33.961
- I'll keep that in mind.

428
00:22:35.658 --> 00:22:37.181
- Oh.

429
00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:38.792
- You need to go?

430
00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:42.448
- Yeah. I have to be someplace.
but just for this week.

431
00:22:43.753 --> 00:22:47.235
I promise I'm 100%
committed to chocolate.

432
00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:57.637
- What about this one?

433
00:22:58.942 --> 00:22:59.900
- Oh. that's lovely.

434
00:22:59.943 --> 00:23:00.857
- Looks good to me.

435
00:23:02.293 --> 00:23:06.733
- Okay. "December
24th. 7:00 p.m."

436
00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:09.736
Can you send me your
guest list today?

437
00:23:10.954 --> 00:23:12.869
- Seems like an awful
lot of work for you?

438
00:23:12.913 --> 00:23:15.611
- It's fine. I have
everything under control.

439
00:23:15.655 --> 00:23:17.874
- You'll be too busy to
finish Alex's training.

440
00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:19.572
- No. it's okay. I can do it.

441
00:23:20.747 --> 00:23:22.096
- Are you sure?

442
00:23:22.139 --> 00:23:23.750
- Yeah. of course.

443
00:23:23.793 --> 00:23:24.577
- Thank goodness.

444
00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:29.625
Teaching new employees has
never been my strong suit.

445
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:31.453
- He's not gonna be
an employee. Dad.

446
00:23:31.497 --> 00:23:32.933
He's going to be
running the business.

447
00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:34.848
so he needs to know
everything he can.

448
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:53.214
Sticky drunken pears?

449
00:23:53.257 --> 00:23:54.433
Mm-mm

450
00:23:56.173 --> 00:23:57.479
- Blood orange souffles?

451
00:23:57.523 --> 00:23:58.306
- Blood?

452
00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:02.310
- Sticky toffee pudding?

453
00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:03.964
- What about figgy pudding?

454
00:24:07.315 --> 00:24:08.534
- This is it.
- Hmm.

455
00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:10.753
- I could make
everyone their own

456
00:24:10.797 --> 00:24:12.973
individual gingerbread house.

457
00:24:13.843 --> 00:24:15.802
- How many guests will there be?

458
00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:16.977
- Not sure yet.

459
00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:20.241
- I've always wanted to learn

460
00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:22.330
how to build a
gingerbread house.

461
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:23.940
- Well. let's do it.

462
00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:25.072
- Now?

463
00:24:26.377 --> 00:24:27.161
Okay.

464
00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:33.123
Well. I have. we just
used graham cracker.

465
00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:34.821
- Graham crackers?
- Yeah.

466
00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:36.170
Use them as the building blocks

467
00:24:36.213 --> 00:24:38.477
and then we just
cover it all candy.

468
00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:41.828
- A lot of people make
their houses for structure

469
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:43.525
and forget about the taste.

470
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:46.963
But my grandfather's recipe
is both strong and delicious.

471
00:24:47.007 --> 00:24:49.662
So you don't have to worry
about them falling apart.

472
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:53.361
- Why don't you just make
one of those big castles

473
00:24:53.404 --> 00:24:56.016
or like one big
skyscraper or something?

474
00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:58.061
Like they do in
those competitions?

475
00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:00.411
- Gingerbread houses
are about tradition.

476
00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:03.937
Like the ones we make
every year. not a contest.

477
00:25:04.807 --> 00:25:06.374
- Right.

478
00:25:06.417 --> 00:25:08.724
- Besides. there's no way to
improve on a little cottage

479
00:25:08.768 --> 00:25:10.378
that looks like it's
from a fairytale.

480
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:11.553
- Yeah.

481
00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:12.946
Yeah. if it ain't broke...

482
00:25:16.427 --> 00:25:17.516
The guest list.

483
00:25:18.734 --> 00:25:20.388
- Showing Alex how
to make gingerbread.

484
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:22.738
- The secret is just the
right amount of strength

485
00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:24.174
to hold it together.

486
00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:25.393
Good to know.

487
00:25:28.483 --> 00:25:29.963
- We're gonna need a few more

488
00:25:30.006 --> 00:25:32.226
gingerbread houses
than I thought.

489
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:33.053
- How many?

490
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.839
- Like. maybe. 50?

491
00:25:38.014 --> 00:25:39.320
- People?

492
00:25:39.363 --> 00:25:42.889
- I don't know. I'll just
have to make it work.

493
00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:46.196
- Okay.

494
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.024
- My mom just sent another list.

495
00:25:49.025 --> 00:25:50.418
How many on that?

496
00:25:50.461 --> 00:25:53.987
- There's just as
many or maybe more.

497
00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:56.729
That many people won't
even fit in our house.

498
00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:57.425
- Well. they won't all come.

499
00:25:58.469 --> 00:25:59.514
They never do.

500
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:00.820
- Are you sure?

501
00:26:00.863 --> 00:26:01.647
- Yeah.

502
00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:07.130
All right. why don't
you just explain to them

503
00:26:07.174 --> 00:26:09.002
that they need to
pare-down their lists?

504
00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:11.091
Tell them you weren't
expecting that many.

505
00:26:11.134 --> 00:26:12.527
- I can't.

506
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.573
How do you tell someone
to choose between friends?

507
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:18.098
- What are you gonna do?

508
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:23.016
- Find a bigger place. order
more food. buy decorations.

509
00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.104
Take out a loan.

510
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:50.434
The 24th.

511
00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:52.785
Yes. this year.

512
00:26:54.743 --> 00:26:56.266
Okay. Thanks.

513
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.442
Is there anywhere else
you could recommend?

514
00:27:00.923 --> 00:27:04.144
No. you're right. Next time
I'll plan further ahead.

515
00:27:04.187 --> 00:27:05.145
Thanks.
- Any luck?

516
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:09.105
If wanna
have it next year.

517
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:10.498
- Oh.

518
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:12.979
You know. I might know of
a place you can have it.

519
00:27:13.022 --> 00:27:13.980
- Really?

520
00:27:14.023 --> 00:27:14.981
- Yeah.

521
00:27:15.024 --> 00:27:16.722
Let me make a call.

522
00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:18.201
That would
be great. Thank you.

523
00:27:18.245 --> 00:27:19.812
- Of course.

524
00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:21.640
- It needs to be big enough
to accommodate 100 people.

525
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.380
but not too big either.

526
00:27:23.424 --> 00:27:26.732
I want it to feel warm and cozy.

527
00:27:26.775 --> 00:27:28.647
- Okay. Big but not too big.

528
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.952
Warm and cozy.

529
00:27:29.996 --> 00:27:31.693
Got it. Anything else?

530
00:27:31.737 --> 00:27:33.303
- Nope. That's it.

531
00:27:33.347 --> 00:27:34.870
- Okay. I'll be back.

532
00:27:34.914 --> 00:27:36.567
Thank you.

533
00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:50.320
Hasn't this place
been closed for years?

534
00:27:50.364 --> 00:27:53.149
- Yeah. Let me get the lights.

535
00:27:57.763 --> 00:27:59.068
Do you know Ernest Hemingway

536
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:01.288
sat right there
by the fireplace?

537
00:28:02.332 --> 00:28:06.075
Frank Sinatra. Bob
Hope. even The Beatles.

538
00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:07.294
They all stayed here.

539
00:28:08.382 --> 00:28:09.992
- Thanks for the
historical tour.

540
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:12.821
but I can't afford this place.

541
00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:15.824
- Just picture it filled
with Christmas decorations.

542
00:28:17.173 --> 00:28:21.003
- It's beautiful. but it's
way more than I can spend.

543
00:28:21.047 --> 00:28:22.483
- Every other place is booked.

544
00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:24.441
- I'll keep looking.

545
00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:25.704
There's gotta be some.

546
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:28.881
- Hey. if you like
it. it's yours.

547
00:28:31.187 --> 00:28:32.754
- How?

548
00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:35.191
- Let's just say I have a
friend that knows a guy.

549
00:28:36.627 --> 00:28:38.978
Just have to leave it
exactly how we found it.

550
00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:40.893
- You're kidding?

551
00:28:41.981 --> 00:28:42.721
- You like it?

552
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:46.159
- It's perfect.

553
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:48.422
We could put a big
Christmas tree over there

554
00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:50.206
with food stations.

555
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.904
Keeps people moving
and mingling.

556
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:54.080
- I love a good food station.

557
00:28:56.212 --> 00:28:57.039
- You hungry?

558
00:28:57.779 --> 00:28:58.606
- Always.

559
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:00.564
- I know a place.

560
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:28.636
my true love gave to me

561
00:29:32.031 --> 00:29:36.165
my true love gave to me

562
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:39.908
partridge in a pear tree

563
00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:41.605
- That one's good.

564
00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:43.477
That one's definitely
my favorite.

565
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.131
- That was my favorite too.

566
00:29:45.174 --> 00:29:46.480
- How did I not know that

567
00:29:46.523 --> 00:29:49.135
food tasting was the
thing before this?

568
00:29:49.178 --> 00:29:49.962
Well.

569
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:51.093
- Last bite's yours.

570
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:53.661
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:55.794
- Okay.

572
00:29:58.057 --> 00:30:00.102
That says a lot about a man.

573
00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:01.451
- What?

574
00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:08.023
- It means you're thoughtful.

575
00:30:08.067 --> 00:30:09.808
You didn't just pop
it in your mouth.

576
00:30:11.113 --> 00:30:13.333
- Guess you can blame
my mother for that.

577
00:30:13.376 --> 00:30:16.553
She always made me offer the
last piece to my sisters.

578
00:30:16.597 --> 00:30:17.946
- How many sisters?

579
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.469
- Two.

580
00:30:19.513 --> 00:30:22.603
I'm in the middle. and pretty
much everything you hear

581
00:30:22.646 --> 00:30:24.823
about middle child is true.

582
00:30:27.042 --> 00:30:30.219
- I'm none of the things you
hear about an only child.

583
00:30:30.263 --> 00:30:31.003
I'm not bossy.

584
00:30:32.091 --> 00:30:33.962
I'm not!
- I didn't say anything.

585
00:30:37.574 --> 00:30:39.098
- Are you still close
with your family?

586
00:30:39.141 --> 00:30:40.882
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

587
00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.536
Yeah. I am.

588
00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:44.103
I moved away for a bit.

589
00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:47.715
I went to Chicago after
college. then I came back here.

590
00:30:48.934 --> 00:30:51.023
I like it here
though. It's home.

591
00:30:52.415 --> 00:30:54.853
- I didn't even plan on coming
home for Christmas this year.

592
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:56.245
- Really?

593
00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:58.160
Whatever it was that
changed your mind.

594
00:30:58.204 --> 00:30:59.379
I'm glad it did.

595
00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:02.208
- It was whoever.

596
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.386
He changed his
mind. so here I am.

597
00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:08.997
- Enough said.

598
00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.522
- Now I can't even
imagine not being here.

599
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:19.747
- For their retirement party.

600
00:31:20.617 --> 00:31:21.401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

601
00:31:24.317 --> 00:31:26.580
- The place is better than
I could have imagined.

602
00:31:26.623 --> 00:31:28.582
And the food is
going to be amazing.

603
00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:29.713
- Yep. Will be.

604
00:31:30.497 --> 00:31:32.020
Everything will be.

605
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:36.982
- So.

606
00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:38.331
- So.

607
00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:39.723
- I'll send out the
invitations tonight.

608
00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:40.942
- Okay.

609
00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:42.335
- Give the final
selections to catering

610
00:31:42.378 --> 00:31:45.381
and that just leaves
decorations and dessert.

611
00:31:47.296 --> 00:31:50.256
- How long does it take to
build one gingerbread house?

612
00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:53.476
- There's no way I
can make and decorate

613
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.435
that many gingerbread
houses in time.

614
00:31:56.871 --> 00:31:58.917
- What if you make one big one?

615
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.919
- I'm not making a
silly skyscraper.

616
00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:06.968
- All right. how about you
order a bunch of pre-made ones

617
00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:08.665
and decorate those?

618
00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:10.276
They'll look just like yours.

619
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.104
- They won't taste the same.

620
00:32:12.147 --> 00:32:13.932
- Everyone just eats
the decorations anyway.

621
00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:18.240
- Okay.

622
00:32:18.284 --> 00:32:19.938
- Okay. I'll take care of it.

623
00:32:21.504 --> 00:32:23.115
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.

624
00:32:24.594 --> 00:32:26.945
- It can't be fine.
It has to be perfect.

625
00:32:42.264 --> 00:32:44.440
- And what do you
think about this one?

626
00:32:44.484 --> 00:32:45.920
- It's too small.

627
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:46.834
It's not big enough.

628
00:32:46.877 --> 00:32:48.967
I want a statement piece.

629
00:32:50.055 --> 00:32:51.491
- A statement piece?

630
00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:54.146
You're really going all out.

631
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.974
- They deserve it.

632
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:57.801
- Okay.

633
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:02.241
But why is the guy that's
buying your parents' place

634
00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:03.982
helping you with the party?

635
00:33:05.287 --> 00:33:08.160
- Because there wouldn't be a
party if it weren't for him.

636
00:33:10.205 --> 00:33:12.991
- Are you sure there's not
something in it for him?

637
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.689
- He's just being nice.

638
00:33:17.604 --> 00:33:20.694
- Maybe he likes
spending time with you?

639
00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:24.176
- I don't think that's it.

640
00:33:24.219 --> 00:33:25.742
We're just friends.

641
00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:26.874
Not really friends.

642
00:33:27.701 --> 00:33:29.181
We're friendly.

643
00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:32.184
Besides he already
has a girlfriend.

644
00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:36.188
- Is that what he
told you over dinner?

645
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:39.017
- It was a food tasting.

646
00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:41.889
- Did you talk?

647
00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:46.328
And laugh?

648
00:33:47.503 --> 00:33:49.027
- Maybe once.

649
00:33:50.158 --> 00:33:52.030
- Some would call that a date.

650
00:33:54.075 --> 00:33:56.556
Or if you have a
girlfriend. a food tasting.

651
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.124
- It's not my fault.

652
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:01.082
My dad asked me to train him.

653
00:34:01.126 --> 00:34:06.044
The lady doth
protest too much. methinks.

654
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.397
That's the one!

655
00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:15.053
- Oh. that's definitely
not going in my car.

656
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:23.409
He's pretty nice.

657
00:34:24.845 --> 00:34:29.023
But you should ask him who that
girl was in the coffee shop.

658
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.633
Okay.

659
00:34:30.677 --> 00:34:33.288
- We have hot chocolate and
cookies over by the fire pit.

660
00:34:33.332 --> 00:34:34.594
- Great. Thank you.

661
00:34:36.204 --> 00:34:38.206
- I gotta go.

662
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.079
But you guys have fun.

663
00:34:43.603 --> 00:34:44.386
Bye.
- Bye.

664
00:34:46.997 --> 00:34:49.957
- Well. I could go for
a cookie. How about you?

665
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.524
- You're always hungry.

666
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:52.612
That's true.

667
00:35:00.924 --> 00:35:01.925
- Here you go.

668
00:35:01.969 --> 00:35:03.231
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

669
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:08.018
Think that's a snowman.

670
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:13.633
Oh.

671
00:35:20.335 --> 00:35:22.468
- Sorry to bother you again.

672
00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:24.122
- Oh. no.

673
00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:25.862
Know how many times I get called

674
00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:28.561
for emergency
Christmas tree picking?

675
00:35:28.604 --> 00:35:30.650
- Not too often. I hope?

676
00:35:30.693 --> 00:35:31.999
- Never. actually.

677
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.961
- Can ask you a question?

678
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:39.485
- Shoot.

679
00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:43.489
- Why are you helping
me with the party?

680
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:47.057
- I don't know.

681
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:48.494
Same reason you're helping me.

682
00:35:49.973 --> 00:35:51.497
- Did my dad ask you to?

683
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.498
- No. No.

684
00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:53.325
I mean.

685
00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:59.766
it's nice. you being willing
to spend your time with me.

686
00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:01.463
It's the least I can do.

687
00:36:02.247 --> 00:36:03.770
- Exactly.

688
00:36:03.813 --> 00:36:06.033
And you're a nice guy.
That's what I told Taylor.

689
00:36:07.426 --> 00:36:09.210
- You talked about me?

690
00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:14.172
Not really.
That's all right.

691
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.044
- She's questioning
my intentions?

692
00:36:18.828 --> 00:36:21.004
- I told her you already
had a girlfriend.

693
00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:23.485
- Why would you say that?

694
00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:25.487
- I assumed.

695
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:29.317
- Ah. You know what they say?

696
00:36:30.275 --> 00:36:31.537
- I thought there
must be someone

697
00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.495
you always leave
at the same time.

698
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.368
- Impressive.

699
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.458
You moonlight as a detective?

700
00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:44.376
Okay.

701
00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:51.383
So I leave to go pick
up Francie. my daughter.

702
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.735
- He's a cutie. You never
mentioned her or your wife.

703
00:36:57.693 --> 00:37:02.394
- My wife. Laura. she died
a little over a year ago.

704
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:06.224
- Alex. I'm so sorry.

705
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:11.925
- That's why I don't mention
it to anybody right away.

706
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:16.059
People always feel sorry for me

707
00:37:16.103 --> 00:37:17.713
and start treating
me differently.

708
00:37:19.324 --> 00:37:20.629
- I would have been nicer.

709
00:37:20.673 --> 00:37:22.849
- Well. it's not
exactly an easy thing

710
00:37:22.892 --> 00:37:24.372
to just come out and say.

711
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:28.115
- I shouldn't have
brought it up.

712
00:37:29.072 --> 00:37:30.552
- No. I'm glad you did.

713
00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:37.994
You two have
your picture taken yet?

714
00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:39.605
- No. that's okay.
- Yeah.

715
00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:41.781
- Oh. you should. You
two are cute together.

716
00:37:43.522 --> 00:37:44.784
- I guess. it's picture time.

717
00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:45.741
- Yeah.
- Okay.

718
00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:47.613
You convinced.

719
00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:49.615
- Get in close.

720
00:37:56.535 --> 00:37:58.363
- Okay.
- There you go.

721
00:37:58.406 --> 00:37:59.277
- Let's see.

722
00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:01.453
- I like it.

723
00:38:02.323 --> 00:38:03.150
- That's not bad.

724
00:38:05.587 --> 00:38:10.636
So you tell Taylor that
the reason I'm helping you

725
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.466
is because I like
spending time with you.

726
00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:17.164
- Okay.

727
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.473
- And that I'm a nice guy.

728
00:38:21.516 --> 00:38:22.474
Got it.

729
00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:23.649
- Don't forget that though.

730
00:38:23.692 --> 00:38:25.259
Right.

731
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.801
Hey.

732
00:38:45.845 --> 00:38:46.672
- Hey.

733
00:38:52.155 --> 00:38:53.679
You look nice.

734
00:38:53.722 --> 00:38:54.506
- Thanks.

735
00:38:57.422 --> 00:38:58.858
Last night was fun.

736
00:38:58.901 --> 00:38:59.511
- Yeah. it was.

737
00:39:02.078 --> 00:39:05.168
We start making
hard mold chocolates in summer.

738
00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.606
- Why so early?

739
00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:10.391
- We get busy in the fall with
Halloween and Thanksgiving.

740
00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:11.566
Then we have a small break

741
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.264
and go into Valentine's
Day and Easter.

742
00:39:14.308 --> 00:39:16.919
- So you were
ahead? That's smart.

743
00:39:16.963 --> 00:39:18.399
- And we always decorate early

744
00:39:18.443 --> 00:39:20.488
because if we don't.
we won't have time.

745
00:39:20.532 --> 00:39:21.359
- Makes sense.

746
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:23.230
- You have your tree up?

747
00:39:23.273 --> 00:39:24.362
- Yeah. the tree.

748
00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:28.366
Does it count if it's
less than a foot?

749
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:31.543
- A foot? That's not
a tree. that's a twig.

750
00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:32.370
- Yeah.

751
00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:34.763
- You haven't
decorated it have you?

752
00:39:34.807 --> 00:39:36.896
- No. Heavens. no.

753
00:39:38.288 --> 00:39:40.378
I wouldn't know where
to begin. honestly.

754
00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:44.251
- I could help. if you want?

755
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.819
- Yeah.

756
00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:49.212
Yeah. I mean. I'll take
all the help I can get.

757
00:39:59.005 --> 00:40:00.398
- Think we have
everything we need.

758
00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:01.964
- Oh! I hope so.

759
00:40:02.008 --> 00:40:03.444
Francie's gonna love it.

760
00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:04.314
- She is.

761
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.405
- You know. I don't
think I've successfully

762
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:09.102
decorated a tree before.

763
00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:10.190
- Really?

764
00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:11.234
Yeah. Like successful.

765
00:40:11.278 --> 00:40:12.584
Surely you have?

766
00:40:18.633 --> 00:40:19.939
- Look. Daddy.

767
00:40:19.982 --> 00:40:22.811
Why is yours
so much better than mine?

768
00:40:22.855 --> 00:40:24.596
- Sadie showed me.

769
00:40:25.771 --> 00:40:28.687
- Are you sure you
haven't done this before?

770
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.471
- Nope.

771
00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:32.734
- Well. you come
in natural talent.

772
00:40:32.778 --> 00:40:35.171
- What about me? Do I
have natural talent?

773
00:40:35.215 --> 00:40:36.129
- It's questionable.

774
00:40:37.043 --> 00:40:38.044
You'll get there.

775
00:40:38.087 --> 00:40:38.871
- Thank you.

776
00:40:39.741 --> 00:40:41.439
- Oh. I love this one.

777
00:40:43.092 --> 00:40:47.009
Do you have a favorite?

778
00:40:47.053 --> 00:40:49.185
- This one.
- Oh. wow.

779
00:40:49.229 --> 00:40:50.448
Is that your hand?

780
00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:52.711
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:40:52.754 --> 00:40:53.799
- I like this one too.

782
00:40:56.236 --> 00:40:59.805
Can she
come to my pageant?

783
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:01.720
- So Francie wants to know

784
00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:04.462
if you'll come to her
Christmas pageant at church?

785
00:41:05.593 --> 00:41:07.334
- Yes. I would love to.

786
00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:09.510
You tell her
what you're gonna be.

787
00:41:09.554 --> 00:41:11.556
- An angel with the crown.

788
00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:12.600
- With a halo.

789
00:41:12.644 --> 00:41:13.862
I can't wait.

790
00:41:13.906 --> 00:41:14.863
- Uh-oh.

791
00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:16.952
- What?
- Seems to be a problem

792
00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:18.345
with these ornaments.

793
00:41:20.347 --> 00:41:23.002
They keep disappearing!

794
00:41:23.045 --> 00:41:24.220
How?

795
00:41:24.264 --> 00:41:26.484
- Don't eat them. Daddy.

796
00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:28.181
Don't eat them?

797
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.012
- That one.
- This one right here?

798
00:41:33.055 --> 00:41:35.144
Okay. Good choice.

799
00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:36.668
What else looks yummy to you?

800
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.322
That one.

801
00:41:39.366 --> 00:41:43.152
- Oh. this is one of
my favorites.

802
00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:46.286
There you go.

803
00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:48.506
And remember we have
candy-making demonstrations

804
00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:51.247
every Saturday at 10
o'clock right over there.

805
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:52.118
- Thank you.

806
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:53.075
- Absolutely.
- Bye.

807
00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:53.859
Bye-bye.

808
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.080
Don't forget to
keep your inventory turning.

809
00:41:58.124 --> 00:41:59.691
- Right. yeah. Got it.

810
00:42:01.475 --> 00:42:04.130
- You know what? It
will all come in time.

811
00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:05.697
I've been doing
this my whole life.

812
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.568
- Yeah. maybe that's
why I feel like

813
00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:08.874
such a klutz around you.

814
00:42:11.224 --> 00:42:13.226
- Why are you doing this?

815
00:42:13.269 --> 00:42:14.401
Why Annedore's?

816
00:42:15.707 --> 00:42:18.797
- Well. when I was
about Francie's age.

817
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.233
I would stand outside the window

818
00:42:20.276 --> 00:42:23.105
to the candy store
that was by our house

819
00:42:23.149 --> 00:42:26.456
and just watch them
make fudge for hours.

820
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.590
And I thought that's something
that I wanna do one day.

821
00:42:29.634 --> 00:42:32.724
You know? I wanna do something
that makes people happy.

822
00:42:34.116 --> 00:42:35.640
- I get that.

823
00:42:35.683 --> 00:42:38.425
Then when I got out of
college. I got a sales job.

824
00:42:38.468 --> 00:42:39.600
I traveled a lot.

825
00:42:40.427 --> 00:42:41.602
So when I became a single dad.

826
00:42:41.646 --> 00:42:43.909
I needed something
close to home.

827
00:42:44.953 --> 00:42:46.694
So I can be there for
Francie's activities.

828
00:42:46.738 --> 00:42:48.261
Pick her up from school.

829
00:42:48.304 --> 00:42:51.046
You know. if she's sick. or
bring her to work if I have to.

830
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.789
- That was my childhood
and I absolutely loved it.

831
00:42:54.833 --> 00:42:55.964
They could hardly
keep me in school

832
00:42:56.008 --> 00:42:57.444
because I wanted to be here.

833
00:42:58.663 --> 00:43:00.534
- So why aren't you
doing this instead of me?

834
00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:03.624
- You'll laugh.

835
00:43:03.668 --> 00:43:04.582
- Promise. I won't.

836
00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:08.150
- My freshman year of college.

837
00:43:08.194 --> 00:43:11.327
I entered a gingerbread
house competition.

838
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:12.764
- Thought you hated those?

839
00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:15.505
- I didn't win.

840
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:16.463
So?

841
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:20.728
- I thought it was perfect.
but the judges didn't.

842
00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:22.861
So I quit.

843
00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:24.776
Changed my major to marketing.

844
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:27.605
- You changed your major
over what some judges said?

845
00:43:29.432 --> 00:43:32.174
- It wasn't perfect.
I know that now.

846
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:33.436
- So what? No one's perfect.

847
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.916
They can't be.

848
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.483
You just have to do your best.

849
00:43:36.526 --> 00:43:38.746
- Customers don't
want to buy your best.

850
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.183
- Yeah. well. they
also won't buy anything

851
00:43:41.227 --> 00:43:42.968
if they don't come
through the door.

852
00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:45.579
- What?

853
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:46.319
- Follow me.

854
00:43:58.723 --> 00:44:00.463
They don't
even sell chocolate.

855
00:44:00.507 --> 00:44:01.769
- No.

856
00:44:01.813 --> 00:44:03.641
But they're giving
out hot spiced cider

857
00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:06.339
and they have all
sorts of gifts to sell.

858
00:44:06.382 --> 00:44:08.036
You're handing them
your customers.

859
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.472
- You mean your customers?

860
00:44:09.516 --> 00:44:10.909
- Not until January 1st.

861
00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:14.652
Christmas is a big part of
your revenue for the year.

862
00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:19.178
- How do we get them back?

863
00:44:20.483 --> 00:44:22.268
- Well. you're the
one in marketing.

864
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:25.358
but could hand out samples.

865
00:44:26.794 --> 00:44:28.013
What was it you said?

866
00:44:28.056 --> 00:44:31.799
There's chocolate. but
then there's Annedore's.

867
00:44:31.843 --> 00:44:33.801
Annedore's is a special.

868
00:44:33.845 --> 00:44:36.325
- You can taste
it in every bite.

869
00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:38.763
- And you need them to taste it.

870
00:44:38.806 --> 00:44:40.808
- But before we can
give them a sample.

871
00:44:40.852 --> 00:44:42.723
we have to get their attention.

872
00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:46.988
- Keep them moving from
their doorway to ours.

873
00:44:47.032 --> 00:44:47.859
Hm!

874
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:56.781
I'll check
my list twice.

875
00:44:56.824 --> 00:44:58.434
- She's gone rogue.

876
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.919
It's a gorgeous eve.

877
00:45:04.963 --> 00:45:07.748
Ho. ho. ho! Merry Christmas!

878
00:45:07.792 --> 00:45:10.751
Merry Christmas! Ho. ho. ho!

879
00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:11.752
- Hey. guys.
- Merry Christmas!

880
00:45:11.796 --> 00:45:13.145
- Hi!
- Thank you so much.

881
00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:15.277
- We've been here so long.

882
00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:17.323
I just assumed
everyone knew about us.

883
00:45:17.366 --> 00:45:19.804
I forgot about marketing.

884
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:21.501
- Sometimes it takes
a fresh set of eyes

885
00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:23.721
to really see what's
in front of you.

886
00:45:29.988 --> 00:45:31.511
- I'm not sure who
did all of this.

887
00:45:31.554 --> 00:45:33.731
- Oh. definitely...

888
00:45:33.774 --> 00:45:35.733
- Well. you make a good team.

889
00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:36.951
This is great.

890
00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:37.909
- Glad you like it.

891
00:45:39.345 --> 00:45:40.389
- Thanks.

892
00:45:40.433 --> 00:45:42.217
- Of course. Dad
- Ho. ho. ho!

893
00:45:42.261 --> 00:45:44.002
Merry Christmas!

894
00:45:44.045 --> 00:45:45.786
You been good this year?

895
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.919
What you want for
Christmas. Francie?

896
00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.279
- All right. we look
good. You ready?

897
00:46:02.063 --> 00:46:03.064
One take.
- That's cute.

898
00:46:03.108 --> 00:46:04.196
Only take one.
- That's cute.

899
00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:05.850
- That's all we need.

900
00:46:05.893 --> 00:46:06.720
Look at her.

901
00:46:07.852 --> 00:46:09.288
Go ahead. pet him. Francie.

902
00:46:11.116 --> 00:46:12.639
Oh. and she loves it.

903
00:46:16.121 --> 00:46:17.122
- It's cute.

904
00:46:34.313 --> 00:46:36.837
boughs of holly

905
00:46:45.106 --> 00:46:47.500
It's
gonna look amazing.

906
00:46:47.543 --> 00:46:48.588
- I don't know what
I would've done

907
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:50.895
if Alex hadn't found this place.

908
00:46:50.938 --> 00:46:52.287
- Sounds like the Scrooge

909
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:54.507
isn't so bad to have
around after all.

910
00:46:55.987 --> 00:46:58.685
- He's different than the
guys I've dated before.

911
00:47:00.078 --> 00:47:04.343
He's responsible and he doesn't
get so absorbed in his work

912
00:47:04.386 --> 00:47:06.345
that he doesn't think
about anyone else.

913
00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:09.174
And he makes me laugh.

914
00:47:10.479 --> 00:47:12.177
- That's what I
want for Christmas.

915
00:47:14.222 --> 00:47:17.051
- I haven't told
anyone else this.

916
00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:20.011
but I might not wanna go back.

917
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.275
Need some help?

918
00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:25.407
- Hey. when did you get here?

919
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.756
- Just now.

920
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.367
- Good. I'm glad you're here.

921
00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:31.022
- Well. I hope you
still feel that way

922
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:33.372
after what I'm
about to tell you.

923
00:47:33.415 --> 00:47:34.199
- Okay?

924
00:47:35.853 --> 00:47:37.376
- You know the gingerbread
houses I ordered

925
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:39.160
to save you time?

926
00:47:39.204 --> 00:47:40.335
- Are they here?

927
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:43.948
- No. We hit a small snag.

928
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:45.732
How small?

929
00:47:45.775 --> 00:47:47.865
- Well. there's
a large snowstorm

930
00:47:47.908 --> 00:47:49.954
covering the southern
part of the country.

931
00:47:50.911 --> 00:47:52.391
- Okay. So?

932
00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:55.829
- So the truck that
your houses are on.

933
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.136
they're stuck somewhere.

934
00:47:58.179 --> 00:47:59.964
- When will they be here?

935
00:48:00.007 --> 00:48:02.053
- Best case scenario.
Christmas Eve.

936
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:04.751
- And worse case?

937
00:48:04.794 --> 00:48:06.057
- Around the 26th.

938
00:48:07.493 --> 00:48:09.103
- Your best case
doesn't even work.

939
00:48:09.147 --> 00:48:12.541
I can't decorate 100 gingerbread
houses in less than a day.

940
00:48:12.585 --> 00:48:13.716
- I know. I know.

941
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.066
That's why I'm gonna help.

942
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:16.806
So will Taylor.

943
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.418
- No. I need an assembly
line of 20 people.

944
00:48:19.461 --> 00:48:21.072
- Okay.

945
00:48:21.115 --> 00:48:25.076
So we think of something
new. something even better.

946
00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.816
- That's not how it works.

947
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.080
I have to plan and shop.

948
00:48:29.123 --> 00:48:30.995
It's a process.

949
00:48:31.038 --> 00:48:34.172
- Well. you have a store
full of chocolate already.

950
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:37.827
- It can't be what we do every
day. It has to be special.

951
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:39.351
- Hey. look. I've got this.

952
00:48:39.394 --> 00:48:41.179
You go figure out what to do.

953
00:48:41.222 --> 00:48:42.571
- Thank you.

954
00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:43.964
- Yeah. and don't
worry about it.

955
00:48:44.008 --> 00:48:46.140
It'll be amazing
whatever happens.

956
00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:47.185
- How do you know?

957
00:48:47.228 --> 00:48:49.100
Because I know you.

958
00:48:50.188 --> 00:48:51.102
- Thanks. Taylor.

959
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:54.235
- Thank you.
- Okay.

960
00:48:54.279 --> 00:48:58.109
I have two days to think
of an idea and execute it.

961
00:48:58.152 --> 00:49:01.808
- Yeah. I'm sorry. I messed up.

962
00:49:01.851 --> 00:49:04.028
- It's not your fault.
It's a snowstorm.

963
00:49:04.071 --> 00:49:06.160
- Well. yeah. if I weren't
trying to cut corners

964
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:07.596
and make things easy on you.

965
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.252
- You know? I can't talk
about this right now.

966
00:49:11.296 --> 00:49:12.906
I have to get back to the shop.

967
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:13.994
- I'll go with you.

968
00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:15.561
- No. that's okay.

969
00:49:15.604 --> 00:49:16.562
I need to think.

970
00:49:16.605 --> 00:49:18.433
- Well. at least let me drive.

971
00:49:18.477 --> 00:49:19.304
- I have my car.

972
00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:24.396
- Okay. I'll walk
you out.

973
00:49:34.797 --> 00:49:35.973
What can I do?

974
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:37.539
- I think we've
covered all the basics

975
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:40.064
and I'm sure you'll outsource
a lot of products anyway.

976
00:49:41.108 --> 00:49:42.414
- I said I was sorry.

977
00:49:42.457 --> 00:49:45.156
- It's fine. I'm just
really behind now.

978
00:49:45.199 --> 00:49:46.461
- So let me help.

979
00:49:46.505 --> 00:49:47.767
- That's okay.

980
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:48.681
Why don't you take
the morning off

981
00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:49.638
and spend it with Francie?

982
00:49:49.682 --> 00:49:50.988
I'm sure she'd love that.

983
00:49:54.339 --> 00:49:55.079
- Okay.

984
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.004
- Why couldn't Sadie come?

985
00:50:07.047 --> 00:50:08.005
- She's working.

986
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:10.181
- Why?

987
00:50:11.573 --> 00:50:14.707
Because Daddy
made a mess of things.

988
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.840
- And Sadie has to clean it up?

989
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:19.799
- Yeah. looks like it.

990
00:50:19.842 --> 00:50:21.496
- We could go help her.

991
00:50:23.933 --> 00:50:26.023
- I think she a little
space right now.

992
00:50:28.242 --> 00:50:29.722
- Can we buy her a present?

993
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.900
- Yes. we can.
That's a great idea.

994
00:50:33.943 --> 00:50:35.075
Do you wanna pick it out?

995
00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.511
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

996
00:50:36.555 --> 00:50:38.383
What do you think about this?

997
00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:39.819
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

998
00:50:45.129 --> 00:50:47.392
Hey. wanna give her some money?

999
00:50:48.784 --> 00:50:49.916
Here.

1000
00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:51.657
Now put it right in the bucket.

1001
00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:53.876
Merry Christmas.

1002
00:50:54.747 --> 00:50:55.922
Nice work. bud.

1003
00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:57.010
Good work.

1004
00:50:57.967 --> 00:50:59.099
Come on. Let's go do it.

1005
00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:01.275
I think she's gonna
love these gifts.

1006
00:51:01.319 --> 00:51:05.366
true love gave to me

1007
00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:09.109
three french hens

1008
00:51:09.153 --> 00:51:14.158
partridge in a pear tree

1009
00:51:15.637 --> 00:51:20.599
my true love gave to me

1010
00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:30.609
three french hens

1011
00:51:32.654 --> 00:51:34.178
- We bought you lunch.

1012
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:35.135
- You did?
- Promise.

1013
00:51:35.179 --> 00:51:36.702
we're not here to interrupt.

1014
00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:39.096
just thought you might
be getting hungry.

1015
00:51:39.139 --> 00:51:40.836
- Did you clean up your mess?

1016
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.837
What mess?

1017
00:51:41.881 --> 00:51:43.752
- The one Daddy made.

1018
00:51:43.796 --> 00:51:44.971
- Oh. that mess?

1019
00:51:45.014 --> 00:51:47.060
No. I'm still working on it.

1020
00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:49.062
- Hey. Francie. why
don't you go find Sherry

1021
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:51.673
and she can help you pick out
a couple of treats. all right?

1022
00:51:51.717 --> 00:51:52.674
- Two?

1023
00:51:52.718 --> 00:51:54.633
- One for now. One for later.

1024
00:51:54.676 --> 00:51:55.808
Okay? But no more.

1025
00:51:56.896 --> 00:51:57.766
- Thanks for the food.

1026
00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.291
- It's the least I can do.

1027
00:52:00.334 --> 00:52:01.814
- I don't blame
you. I really don't.

1028
00:52:01.857 --> 00:52:04.164
But this is something
I need to do by myself.

1029
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:05.774
- Yeah. I get that.

1030
00:52:07.646 --> 00:52:09.691
You're making turtles
for the party?

1031
00:52:09.735 --> 00:52:10.779
- No. we're just low.

1032
00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:12.129
So I thought I'd get that done

1033
00:52:12.172 --> 00:52:13.608
before I start on the dessert.

1034
00:52:14.827 --> 00:52:17.177
- Why don't I do this.
stay out of your hair.

1035
00:52:17.221 --> 00:52:19.788
and you can focus
on the dessert?

1036
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:22.704
- You think you're ready
to do turtles by yourself?

1037
00:52:22.748 --> 00:52:23.488
- I'm ready.

1038
00:52:24.837 --> 00:52:25.664
- Fine.

1039
00:52:26.578 --> 00:52:29.189
- I got two cookies!

1040
00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:31.191
- Baby. those are actually-

1041
00:52:31.235 --> 00:52:33.150
- You want me to show
you how to make them?

1042
00:52:33.193 --> 00:52:34.325
Okay.

1043
00:52:37.241 --> 00:52:39.025
My daddy showed me
how to make macaroons

1044
00:52:39.068 --> 00:52:40.592
when I was just about your age.

1045
00:52:40.635 --> 00:52:41.506
- He did?

1046
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:43.725
- Uh-huh. Sitting right there.

1047
00:52:43.769 --> 00:52:44.596
- Like me!

1048
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:49.035
- My job was to put the cream
filling on just like this.

1049
00:52:49.078 --> 00:52:51.168
- I can do that.
- Okay.

1050
00:52:52.256 --> 00:52:54.171
All right. Slowly.

1051
00:52:55.563 --> 00:52:58.218
Do you know what my
favorite flavor was?

1052
00:52:58.262 --> 00:52:59.219
- Pink.

1053
00:52:59.263 --> 00:53:01.482
- How did you know that?

1054
00:53:01.526 --> 00:53:05.573
- That's my favorite color.

1055
00:53:05.617 --> 00:53:08.315
- Ah. voila!

1056
00:53:08.359 --> 00:53:11.231
- Very nice.
- I learned for the best.

1057
00:53:11.275 --> 00:53:13.233
- I don't know about that.

1058
00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:15.670
Okay. put them together
just like I showed you.

1059
00:53:15.714 --> 00:53:17.672
Slow and twist.

1060
00:53:17.716 --> 00:53:19.021
- Hey. thank you for doing this.

1061
00:53:19.065 --> 00:53:20.719
- This was a nice distraction.

1062
00:53:22.286 --> 00:53:24.288
- I think they call it
procrastination. actually.

1063
00:53:25.158 --> 00:53:27.247
- Is it that obvious?

1064
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:29.597
- Still don't know what
you're gonna do. huh?

1065
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:30.685
Not a clue.

1066
00:53:31.947 --> 00:53:34.863
- Well. I find that
inspiration strikes

1067
00:53:34.907 --> 00:53:36.561
when you least expect it.

1068
00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:37.344
- I hope so.

1069
00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:40.173
Do you wanna try one?

1070
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.000
Go on.

1071
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:44.569
- Ooh!

1072
00:53:46.005 --> 00:53:47.224
Is that good?

1073
00:53:47.267 --> 00:53:48.790
Yeah?

1074
00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.575
All right. baby. it's
time tell Sadie bye. okay?

1075
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:54.100
- Maybe you should take a
few to share with your dad.

1076
00:53:54.143 --> 00:53:57.103
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Like that idea.

1077
00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:58.626
- What do you think? Three.

1078
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:59.975
Here's a good one.

1079
00:54:00.019 --> 00:54:02.717
- That's very generous.

1080
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:04.502
- Okay. See you later.

1081
00:54:04.545 --> 00:54:05.416
- Bye.

1082
00:54:05.459 --> 00:54:07.200
I'll see you later.

1083
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.027
Bye.

1084
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.205
- Listen. I hate
to bring this up

1085
00:54:13.162 --> 00:54:14.990
and don't feel obligated at all.

1086
00:54:15.034 --> 00:54:17.254
but tonight is
Francie's pageant.

1087
00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:21.214
- No. I know. it's
on my calendar.

1088
00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:22.128
I'll be there.

1089
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:23.956
- You don't have to. honestly.

1090
00:54:23.999 --> 00:54:25.262
I'll explain to her
that you're busy.

1091
00:54:25.305 --> 00:54:27.264
It's okay. She'll understand.

1092
00:54:27.307 --> 00:54:28.439
- That's okay.

1093
00:54:28.482 --> 00:54:29.266
- You sure?

1094
00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:31.703
All right.

1095
00:54:31.746 --> 00:54:33.313
- Bye.

1096
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:34.140
- Good luck.

1097
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:40.233
- "And there were shepherds
living out in the fields nearby.

1098
00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:43.018
"keeping watch over
their flocks at night.

1099
00:54:43.062 --> 00:54:45.151
"an angel of the
Lord appeared to them

1100
00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:47.196
"and the glory of the
Lord shone around them

1101
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.807
"and they were terrified."

1102
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:53.333
- You made it.

1103
00:54:53.377 --> 00:54:54.987
- Wouldn't miss it.

1104
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:57.642
Besides. it's the
hottest seat in town.

1105
00:54:57.685 --> 00:54:59.600
- Do not be afraid.

1106
00:54:59.644 --> 00:55:01.036
I bring you great news

1107
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.169
that will cause great
joy for everyone.

1108
00:55:03.212 --> 00:55:04.605
Today in the town of David.

1109
00:55:04.649 --> 00:55:06.999
a Savior has been born to you.

1110
00:55:07.042 --> 00:55:09.131
He is the Messiah. The Lord.

1111
00:55:09.175 --> 00:55:11.003
This will be assigned to you.

1112
00:55:11.046 --> 00:55:12.526
You will find a baby
wrapped in cloths

1113
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.180
and lying in a manger.

1114
00:55:14.223 --> 00:55:16.965
Glory to
God in the highest.

1115
00:55:17.009 --> 00:55:20.273
Peace on earth. Goodwill to men.

1116
00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:21.492
- Let's go to Bethlehem

1117
00:55:21.535 --> 00:55:22.884
and see this thing
that has happened.

1118
00:55:22.928 --> 00:55:24.886
which the Lord
has told us about.

1119
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.235
- "So they hurried off

1120
00:55:26.279 --> 00:55:28.020
"and found Mary and
Joseph and the baby.

1121
00:55:28.063 --> 00:55:30.283
"who was lying in a manger."

1122
00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:35.332
no crib for a bed

1123
00:55:37.551 --> 00:55:42.513
lay down his sweet head

1124
00:55:44.558 --> 00:55:49.650
look down where he lay

1125
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:56.222
asleep on the hay

1126
00:56:10.236 --> 00:56:11.368
She was just
wonderful. wasn't she?

1127
00:56:12.543 --> 00:56:13.848
- Chip off the old block.

1128
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:15.937
Come here you!

1129
00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:18.897
Oh. I'm so proud of you!

1130
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.377
Good job. baby.

1131
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.378
You did so well.

1132
00:56:21.421 --> 00:56:23.336
- Do you like my crown?

1133
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.903
- Yes. I love your crown.

1134
00:56:24.946 --> 00:56:26.383
I'm thinking of getting one.

1135
00:56:27.471 --> 00:56:29.777
- Oh. look at that.

1136
00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:30.561
- How do I look?

1137
00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:32.389
- Like an angel.

1138
00:56:33.477 --> 00:56:35.392
- Are you coming to my house?

1139
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.264
- Well. baby.
Sadie has something

1140
00:56:38.307 --> 00:56:41.267
really. really important
to work on tonight.

1141
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.487
but it was sweet of
her to come. wasn't it?

1142
00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.097
- Yeah. it was.

1143
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.315
Thank you.

1144
00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:47.882
- Of course.

1145
00:56:47.926 --> 00:56:49.144
It was nice to meet you both.

1146
00:56:49.188 --> 00:56:50.581
Oh. you too. Merry Christmas.
- You too.

1147
00:56:50.624 --> 00:56:52.452
Hope we see you again soon.

1148
00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:53.279
- Bye.
- Bye.

1149
00:56:58.632 --> 00:57:01.418
- Aren't these cute.
Where'd you get these?

1150
00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:04.159
- I made them. Look at this one.

1151
00:57:04.203 --> 00:57:04.943
- Oh.

1152
00:57:06.466 --> 00:57:08.468
- You're supposed to wait
till after Christmas.

1153
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:10.688
but Daddy keeps eating them.

1154
00:57:10.731 --> 00:57:13.560
Could you
teach me to make some?

1155
00:57:13.604 --> 00:57:14.518
- Sadie could.

1156
00:57:15.823 --> 00:57:17.303
- Who wants peanut brittle?

1157
00:57:18.609 --> 00:57:22.134
- I'll give it a try.
Thank you.

1158
00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:24.310
Hmm! Did you make this?

1159
00:57:24.353 --> 00:57:25.964
- No. you're surprised?

1160
00:57:26.007 --> 00:57:26.921
- I know you're not official

1161
00:57:26.965 --> 00:57:28.488
till after the 1st of the year.

1162
00:57:28.532 --> 00:57:30.490
but I think we can get
some of this before then?

1163
00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:31.622
- Oh. boy.

1164
00:57:31.665 --> 00:57:33.667
My profit margin's
decreasing already.

1165
00:57:34.842 --> 00:57:35.930
- A toast.

1166
00:57:37.366 --> 00:57:40.500
To Francie. the most convincing
angel I've ever seen.

1167
00:57:40.544 --> 00:57:42.502
To Francie.

1168
00:57:42.546 --> 00:57:44.635
- Well done. baby.

1169
00:57:44.678 --> 00:57:48.290
- Hmm! You should invite
Sadie over for Christmas.

1170
00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:49.466
- Yay!

1171
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:51.468
- Sure.

1172
00:57:52.556 --> 00:57:54.340
- That's something
to think about.

1173
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:47.828
Hi. Sadie.

1174
00:58:47.872 --> 00:58:49.134
- Hey. Beth. how are you?

1175
00:58:49.177 --> 00:58:51.136
- Good. What can I get you?

1176
00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:53.486
- Oh. caffeine and sugar.

1177
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.835
- You got it.

1178
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:55.706
Anything else?

1179
00:58:57.925 --> 00:58:59.100
- Only if you have something

1180
00:58:59.144 --> 00:59:01.146
that can help me
come up with an idea.

1181
00:59:01.189 --> 00:59:02.756
- I wish I did.

1182
00:59:04.018 --> 00:59:06.412
- I think I'm trying so
hard. my mind is blank.

1183
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:11.243
- Same thing happens to me.
It's the pressure to create.

1184
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.597
I try to get my mind off of
what I'm trying to think about.

1185
00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:18.946
and that's when it hits me.

1186
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.339
It's like it's so obvious.

1187
00:59:20.382 --> 00:59:22.080
Like it's been there all along.

1188
00:59:23.255 --> 00:59:24.909
- Okay.

1189
00:59:24.952 --> 00:59:28.086
My mind is a clean slate.
I'm thinking about nothing.

1190
00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:31.263
- Merry Christmas.

1191
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:34.875
Merry Christmas.

1192
00:59:43.057 --> 00:59:43.928
There it is.

1193
00:59:44.842 --> 00:59:46.104
Right in front of me.

1194
00:59:47.496 --> 00:59:48.454
- What is?

1195
00:59:51.283 --> 00:59:52.458
- You're a genius.

1196
00:59:52.501 --> 00:59:53.154
I've gotta get to work.

1197
00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:54.112
Thank you!

1198
00:59:56.767 --> 00:59:58.072
- You're welcome.

1199
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.691
- I'm never gonna
get this all done.

1200
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:46.050
I could use some help after all.

1201
01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:49.183
Okay.

1202
01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:50.228
See you soon.

1203
01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:52.056
Thanks.

1204
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.060
I thought I could
get everything done.

1205
01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:57.670
but the houses got
stuck in the snow.

1206
01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.541
and there just
isn't enough time.

1207
01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:01.587
- We're glad you called.

1208
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.240
- You are?

1209
01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:04.068
- Yeah.

1210
01:02:04.111 --> 01:02:06.723
It's nice to think you still
need us once in a while.

1211
01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.291
- How many nights have
we spent right here?

1212
01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:12.293
Valentine's Day and Easter.

1213
01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.338
trying to make all the chocolate

1214
01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:14.905
so we could fill all the orders.

1215
01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:17.211
- We always got
them done didn't we?

1216
01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.779
- Well. it's going to
take a miracle this time.

1217
01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:22.216
- Even if you don't get
every last detail done.

1218
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.740
it's going to be great.

1219
01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.700
- But I wanted everything
to be perfect for you.

1220
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.398
- Oh. sweetie. It already is.

1221
01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:33.924
Why don't you take
a little break?

1222
01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:34.838
We'll keep working.

1223
01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.535
- I'm not leaving you guys here.

1224
01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:38.363
- We can handle it.

1225
01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:39.277
Go get something to eat.

1226
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.801
We'll be here when you get back.

1227
01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:42.628
Go!

1228
01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:44.586
- Okay. Okay.

1229
01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:01.125
It finally came to me.

1230
01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:01.952
You were right.

1231
01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:03.954
What'd you say?

1232
01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:06.304
I said
you were right.

1233
01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.779
You didn't have to come.

1234
01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.346
- Yeah. I did.

1235
01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:50.217
I had to hear it in person.

1236
01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:51.479
I'm not
saying it again.

1237
01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:53.220
That's all
right. I recorded it.

1238
01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:54.831
Play it back whenever I want.

1239
01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.358
- Do you ever get
that hint of sadness

1240
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:02.012
right before Christmas?

1241
01:04:02.055 --> 01:04:05.232
Because you know all the
anticipation is almost over?

1242
01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:06.364
- I guess so. Yeah.

1243
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:09.193
- That's how I feel tonight.

1244
01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:12.370
Excited with a hint of sad.

1245
01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:15.416
Tomorrow's the party.
then Christmas.

1246
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.201
and you'll be the chocolatier.

1247
01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:19.856
- Yeah.

1248
01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:26.079
Honestly. I don't know how
I'm gonna do this without you.

1249
01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.733
I'm not ready.

1250
01:04:27.776 --> 01:04:29.039
Yes. You are.

1251
01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:31.432
- Sweet of you to think so.

1252
01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:34.392
But you both know I'm not.

1253
01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:39.745
- You don't have to do
everything yourself. Alex.

1254
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:40.572
- Really?

1255
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:44.576
That's the case. why don't I
come back and help you tonight?

1256
01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:50.364
- I would say. okay. but I
want it to be a surprise.

1257
01:04:50.408 --> 01:04:51.235
Why?

1258
01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:55.761
- You may have played a very
small part in my inspiration.

1259
01:04:56.588 --> 01:04:57.371
I think you'll like it.

1260
01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:59.199
- I played a part. huh?

1261
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.289
- If you hadn't talked me

1262
01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:03.638
into ordering the
gingerbread houses.

1263
01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.205
and they hadn't been delayed.

1264
01:05:05.249 --> 01:05:07.991
I never would have been
forced to do something else.

1265
01:05:08.034 --> 01:05:11.429
- So I make problems
and you solve them?

1266
01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:15.172
Sounds like you're saying
we make a great team.

1267
01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:17.522
- Is that what you heard?
- Mm-hmm.

1268
01:05:19.393 --> 01:05:20.264
I wanted to thank you.

1269
01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.224
Really made this a special
Christmas for Francie.

1270
01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:27.619
- She's an easy kid to like.

1271
01:05:28.663 --> 01:05:30.100
- And she really likes you.

1272
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.453
She's gonna miss
you after you leave.

1273
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.934
- I'll miss her too.

1274
01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:42.460
She may wanna
come visit sometime.

1275
01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:44.636
- She should.

1276
01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:48.335
- I would have to
be there. of course.

1277
01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:50.642
she's too young
to fly by herself.

1278
01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:53.993
- Of course. and
I'll come home too.

1279
01:05:54.037 --> 01:05:55.821
To visit my parents.

1280
01:05:58.476 --> 01:05:59.781
- I bet they'd like that.

1281
01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.480
- I hope so.

1282
01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:10.140
- I'm sorry.

1283
01:06:11.402 --> 01:06:12.446
One second.

1284
01:06:15.275 --> 01:06:17.234
I have to pick up Francie.

1285
01:06:17.277 --> 01:06:18.496
- I need to get back too.

1286
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:25.764
Hi. you've reached
Sadie's phone.

1287
01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:27.679
I'm not here right now.
so please leave a message.

1288
01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.421
- Sadie. I was able to
get a flight after all.

1289
01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:31.596
So I'll be home for Christmas.

1290
01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:34.860
So I'll give you a
call when I get in.

1291
01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:37.036
Maybe we could get together?

1292
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:37.994
See ya.

1293
01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:56.534
- Do you think she'll like it?

1294
01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:57.665
- I think she'll love it.

1295
01:06:58.753 --> 01:07:03.193
Okay. "To Sadie from
Francie and Alex."

1296
01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:08.198
- You should write love.

1297
01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.506
- And you should go get dressed.

1298
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.856
Go on. I'll finish this.

1299
01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.380
Remember to brush your teeth.

1300
01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:18.208
Okay.
- Okay.

1301
01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:31.569
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey. Lisa. Come in.

1302
01:07:31.612 --> 01:07:33.136
- Hey
- How are you?

1303
01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:34.093
Good.
good. How are you?

1304
01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:35.529
- Pretty decent. Pretty decent.

1305
01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:39.403
- I can't stay. but
this is for Francie.

1306
01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:41.535
- Oh. great. She's upstairs.

1307
01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:44.538
We were just finishing
this gift for Sadie.

1308
01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.758
- This tree looks amazing.
- Yeah.

1309
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:50.414
- You do this.
- Not entirely. Sadie helped.

1310
01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:51.937
- Who's this Sadie?

1311
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.374
- Her parents own Annedore's.
the place I'm buying.

1312
01:07:54.418 --> 01:07:56.594
- That was very nice of you
to buy their daughter a gift.

1313
01:07:56.637 --> 01:07:59.988
- Well. that was
entirely Francie's idea.

1314
01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:01.077
She really likes her.

1315
01:08:02.556 --> 01:08:03.775
What?

1316
01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:04.993
- Nothing.

1317
01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.430
It's nice.

1318
01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:08.867
- It's a business relationship.

1319
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.434
And she's been helping
me out at the shop.

1320
01:08:10.477 --> 01:08:12.436
so I'm helping her

1321
01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:14.612
with her parents' retirement
party. that's all.

1322
01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.788
- You don't have to
explain anything to me.

1323
01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:18.137
- We're just friends. Lisa.

1324
01:08:18.181 --> 01:08:20.792
- Alex. It's okay.

1325
01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:23.447
I want you to find somebody.

1326
01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:26.537
And Laura would want
that for you too.

1327
01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:29.757
Not just you. Francie
needs someone.

1328
01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:30.802
She has you.

1329
01:08:32.673 --> 01:08:33.892
- It's not really the same.

1330
01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:38.114
- Well. it doesn't matter.

1331
01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.290
She's only here for Christmas.

1332
01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:42.640
- Well. have you told
her how you feel?

1333
01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:45.164
- Not in the exact words.

1334
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:47.601
- Okay. so used the exact words.

1335
01:08:49.734 --> 01:08:52.606
- What if she doesn't feel
the same? Then it's...

1336
01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:55.566
- Oh. women do not
just come to your house

1337
01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.134
and decorate your tree and
spend time with your child

1338
01:08:58.177 --> 01:09:00.658
because they have a business
relationship with you.

1339
01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:03.704
- They don't. huh?

1340
01:09:03.748 --> 01:09:04.749
Don't think so.

1341
01:09:38.826 --> 01:09:40.393
Hi. you've
reached Sadie's phone.

1342
01:09:40.437 --> 01:09:42.526
I'm not here right now.
So please leave a message.

1343
01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.093
- I'm not sure if
he got my message.

1344
01:09:45.137 --> 01:09:48.096
but I'm back and thought
we could get together.

1345
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.707
Call me.

1346
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.492
- Did you know he plans on
outsourcing his peanut brittle?

1347
01:09:52.536 --> 01:09:53.667
- No. I didn't know that.

1348
01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.104
But it's not a bad idea.

1349
01:09:56.148 --> 01:09:58.672
since we only make it
around the holidays.

1350
01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:00.196
- But it's not just the brittle.

1351
01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:02.067
He's going to change everything.

1352
01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.375
- Well. it's going
to be his store.

1353
01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:06.376
- Really?

1354
01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:07.725
You don't care anymore?

1355
01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:11.859
- I've cared for
over 40 years. Sadie.

1356
01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:14.732
I've had my say.
now it's his turn.

1357
01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:17.996
Alex can do whatever he wants.

1358
01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:31.705
- I'll go talk to her.

1359
01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:44.414
- Why am I the
only one who cares?

1360
01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:49.941
- Is it really the brittle
that's got you so upset?

1361
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.858
- He has a girlfriend.

1362
01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:56.643
I asked him if he did
and he said he didn't.

1363
01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:58.297
Why would he do that?
- Are you sure?

1364
01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:00.778
I mean. that doesn't
sound like him.

1365
01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:03.128
- That's what I thought
too. but I was wrong.

1366
01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:05.391
- Sorry.

1367
01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:08.089
- Oh. I'm just so embarrassed.

1368
01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:11.745
- Hey. ah. if anyone's
embarrassed. it should be Alex.

1369
01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:18.012
It's an early Christmas gift.

1370
01:11:18.056 --> 01:11:19.623
What is it?

1371
01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:20.711
- Let's find out.

1372
01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:27.761
I thought you might want
something new to wear tonight.

1373
01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:30.460
- It's beautiful. Thanks. Mom.

1374
01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:31.374
- Sure.

1375
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:32.636
It's more beautiful on you.

1376
01:11:35.073 --> 01:11:37.075
- You look pretty. Daddy.

1377
01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.468
- Pretty. huh?

1378
01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:39.817
That's what I was going for.

1379
01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:41.732
- And smell good too.

1380
01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:44.300
- Thank you.

1381
01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:45.649
Hey. remember Aunt Lisa's coming

1382
01:11:45.692 --> 01:11:47.781
to get you ready for the party.

1383
01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:49.305
Daddy has to do something first.

1384
01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:50.741
but I'll meet you there. okay?

1385
01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:51.481
- Okay.

1386
01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:58.314
bells. jingle all the way

1387
01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:02.405
in a one horse open sleigh

1388
01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:09.499
- Hey!

1389
01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:12.110
Hi. you've
reached Sadie's phone.

1390
01:12:12.153 --> 01:12:14.721
I'm not here right now.
So please leave a message.

1391
01:12:14.765 --> 01:12:18.203
- So I don't know if you
got my earlier message.

1392
01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:19.683
but I came back to see you.

1393
01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:22.816
What are you doing
for Christmas?

1394
01:12:39.485 --> 01:12:40.573
You're probably busy.

1395
01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:43.184
So just thought. I'd say

1396
01:12:45.883 --> 01:12:47.232
Merry Christmas. Sadie.

1397
01:13:12.213 --> 01:13:14.172
- What are you doing here?

1398
01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:16.392
- I've been wanting
to talk to you.

1399
01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:17.871
- Now's not a good time.

1400
01:13:17.915 --> 01:13:20.047
- Please. it's important.

1401
01:13:21.353 --> 01:13:22.920
I'm afraid if I don't
tell you this now.

1402
01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.878
then it's gonna be too late.

1403
01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:26.445
- I already know what
you're going to say.

1404
01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:27.272
- Really?

1405
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:29.927
I don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

1406
01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:32.451
- You don't have
to say anything.

1407
01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:35.933
I just wish you would
have been honest with me.

1408
01:13:35.976 --> 01:13:37.978
- I haven't been
dishonest with you.

1409
01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:41.982
- I asked you if you had a
girlfriend and you said no.

1410
01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:42.766
- I don't.

1411
01:13:44.376 --> 01:13:46.378
- I saw you with her
at the coffee shop.

1412
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.945
The morning we met.

1413
01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:50.730
- You mean the day you told
Taylor I was the Scrooge.

1414
01:13:50.774 --> 01:13:52.253
and I was stealing Christmas?

1415
01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:54.995
- You were listening
to my conversation?

1416
01:13:55.039 --> 01:13:57.258
- Couldn't help it. you were
sitting right next to me.

1417
01:13:57.302 --> 01:13:59.478
- Then you knew how I
felt about Annedore's.

1418
01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:02.438
- If I had known you then I
wouldn't have bought the place.

1419
01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:05.876
- That's just it.

1420
01:14:05.919 --> 01:14:07.791
You couldn't have known.

1421
01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:08.966
I didn't.

1422
01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:11.316
- I'm sorry.

1423
01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:15.146
- It's okay.

1424
01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:17.496
It's yours.

1425
01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.976
And I wish you all the luck.

1426
01:14:21.718 --> 01:14:22.936
- She's my sister-in-law.

1427
01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:27.724
- Your sister-in-law?

1428
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.508
- Hmm. Lisa.

1429
01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:30.466
Laura's sister.

1430
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.994
- I've gotta get this
to the hotel. so.

1431
01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.343
- Let me carry it.

1432
01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:42.173
Please. let me drive. The
roads are getting slick.

1433
01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:43.000
- Okay.

1434
01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:05.805
- Did I tell you
I like your dress?

1435
01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:08.504
- No. you didn't.

1436
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.201
- Well. I do.

1437
01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:12.029
You look nice.

1438
01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:14.901
- So do you.

1439
01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:18.339
Thanks. Francie
picked up my tie.

1440
01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:20.559
- Where is Francie?

1441
01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:21.517
- She'll be there.

1442
01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:27.044
- I hope people will still
come in this weather.

1443
01:15:28.349 --> 01:15:30.787
- If they don't. you're gonna
have a lot of leftover food.

1444
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.528
- You're always
thinking about food.

1445
01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:36.053
- Have a question.

1446
01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:39.012
The first time we met.

1447
01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:44.017
you acted like you
didn't recognize me.

1448
01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:47.064
Why didn't you say anything?

1449
01:15:49.196 --> 01:15:51.068
- I hoped you hadn't seen me.

1450
01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:55.551
- Trust me. I saw you.

1451
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:04.255
And the reason I showed
up at Annedore's earlier.

1452
01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:06.083
I wanted to...

1453
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:08.955
I wanted to...

1454
01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:10.740
- Maybe talk about this later?

1455
01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:13.438
I just wanna focus on the party.

1456
01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:17.573
- Yeah. Yeah. sure.

1457
01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:36.504
This is great.

1458
01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:38.115
Isn't it?

1459
01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:40.291
Oh. this place.

1460
01:16:42.946 --> 01:16:44.600
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1461
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:47.254
Here's your receipt.

1462
01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:53.217
- I think there's
been a mistake.

1463
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.653
I can't pay for this.

1464
01:16:54.697 --> 01:16:56.133
- It's already been paid.

1465
01:16:57.003 --> 01:16:58.222
- Thank you.

1466
01:16:58.265 --> 01:16:59.136
- Oh. I got that.

1467
01:16:59.179 --> 01:17:00.267
Thanks so much.

1468
01:17:05.185 --> 01:17:06.317
Oh. yeah. Thank you.

1469
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.320
- Thank you.

1470
01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:10.147
- Thanks.

1471
01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.151
- I don't think your
Ebenezer. not even close.

1472
01:17:15.587 --> 01:17:18.198
- That might be the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

1473
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:24.117
- You're not at all who I
thought you were going to be.

1474
01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:25.815
- So. why did I tell ya?

1475
01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:30.123
- Wow. It looks incredible.

1476
01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:32.473
- Yeah. it does.

1477
01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:34.824
- I can't believe it.

1478
01:17:35.738 --> 01:17:37.348
You did all of this for us?

1479
01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:39.829
It's
absolutely beautiful.

1480
01:17:39.872 --> 01:17:41.569
Well. it was all Sadie.

1481
01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:43.267
- No. it wasn't.

1482
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:46.009
I couldn't have done any of it
if it weren't for all of you.

1483
01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:47.706
Taylor helped me decorate.

1484
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:50.535
Alex found this amazing room.

1485
01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:53.146
and Mom and Dad were
here to help me finish.

1486
01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:55.540
I have a surprise.

1487
01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:04.288
- Oh.
- Wow.

1488
01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.855
Annedore's.

1489
01:18:05.898 --> 01:18:07.291
It's brilliant.

1490
01:18:07.334 --> 01:18:08.553
- It was your idea to do

1491
01:18:08.596 --> 01:18:11.164
one big gingerbread
house all along.

1492
01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:13.036
- I can't think
of anything better

1493
01:18:13.079 --> 01:18:15.342
than making a gingerbread
house out of the place

1494
01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:17.083
that brought us the most joy.

1495
01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:21.218
and with the people that have
brought me even more joy.

1496
01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:23.568
Shall we toast?

1497
01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:35.232
To sweet
endings and new beginnings.

1498
01:18:36.015 --> 01:18:36.886
For all of us.

1499
01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:40.628
- Wait.

1500
01:18:40.672 --> 01:18:41.542
Wait. sorry.

1501
01:18:42.587 --> 01:18:44.371
I don't think I can do this.

1502
01:18:45.633 --> 01:18:47.897
I mean. you guys have
such a wonderful business.

1503
01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.551
but I'm not the
right person for it.

1504
01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:53.206
Sadie is.

1505
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:57.080
Christopher.
Hey. congratulations.

1506
01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:00.648
We must be getting
old now. you know?

1507
01:19:00.692 --> 01:19:02.259
- You can't back out.

1508
01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:05.044
- Sadie. this has been your
dream from the beginning.

1509
01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:08.134
I'm not taking that from you.

1510
01:19:08.178 --> 01:19:09.266
- What's going on?

1511
01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:14.271
- Alex thinks that I want
Annedore's. so he's backing out.

1512
01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:15.533
- What's wrong?

1513
01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.143
- Alex thinks that
Sadie wants Annedore's.

1514
01:19:17.187 --> 01:19:18.754
and that's why he's backing out.

1515
01:19:20.103 --> 01:19:21.234
- Is this true?

1516
01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:23.106
- I'm sorry. Daddy.
I told him not to.

1517
01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:25.456
- It was always my dream

1518
01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.284
that you would take
over Annedore's.

1519
01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:29.982
I didn't think you wanted it.

1520
01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:31.027
- Daddy-
- We just want you

1521
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.941
to be happy.

1522
01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:34.291
- I am.

1523
01:19:37.642 --> 01:19:38.904
I can't do this to you.

1524
01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:41.733
- Yes. you can.

1525
01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.344
I can find another business.

1526
01:19:44.388 --> 01:19:47.652
One that needs to
change and grow.

1527
01:19:47.695 --> 01:19:49.262
Not one that's already perfect.

1528
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:51.830
- We're not perfect.

1529
01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:55.312
We need new equipment and
we could open a new location

1530
01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:57.314
and expand our
existing product line.

1531
01:19:58.358 --> 01:19:59.490
- Are we still retiring?

1532
01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:04.625
- I'll need a partner.

1533
01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.628
- I'm listening.

1534
01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:09.369
- 50/50.

1535
01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:12.329
I promise to listen to your
ideas if you listen to mine.

1536
01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:18.465
- I love you.

1537
01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:21.686
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1538
01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:23.819
- I love you too.

1539
01:20:31.609 --> 01:20:32.828
Is that a yes?

1540
01:20:34.699 --> 01:20:36.396
- Sadie! Sadie!

1541
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.182
We got you something
from me and Daddy.

1542
01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:40.139
- You did?

1543
01:20:41.227 --> 01:20:42.446
- Sadie. this is Lisa.

1544
01:20:42.489 --> 01:20:43.795
Lisa. Sadie.

1545
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.492
- Hi. It's very nice
to finally meet you.

1546
01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:48.756
- I've heard a lot about
you from both of them.

1547
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.019
- Open it!

1548
01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:50.846
- Okay.

1549
01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.370
It's you and Daddy.

1550
01:20:53.413 --> 01:20:55.894
She picked
it out herself.

1551
01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:56.721
- Thank you.

1552
01:20:58.288 --> 01:21:03.162
let nothing you dismay

1553
01:21:03.206 --> 01:21:07.471
was born on Christmas Day

1554
01:21:07.514 --> 01:21:10.082
from Satan's power

1555
01:21:12.258 --> 01:21:15.653
comfort and joy

1556
01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:21.920
comfort and joy

1557
01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:26.925
the blessed angels came

1558
01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:33.932
- Can I get
everybody's attention?

1559
01:21:33.976 --> 01:21:35.586
Tonight is special.

1560
01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:38.589
and not just because
it's Christmas Eve.

1561
01:21:39.982 --> 01:21:42.941
but because we're surrounded
by all our friends.

1562
01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:45.074
We got quite a surprise tonight.

1563
01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:48.033
Not only are we retiring.

1564
01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:53.125
but our dear Sadie is coming
home to run Annedore's

1565
01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:55.432
with her new business
partner. Alex Mitchell.

1566
01:21:56.737 --> 01:22:01.438
Alex. Francie. welcome
to the Annedore family.

1567
01:22:03.527 --> 01:22:07.400
And Sadie. welcome home.

1568
01:22:07.444 --> 01:22:08.924
We couldn't be happier.

1569
01:22:11.361 --> 01:22:14.016
Do you hear?

1570
01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:16.975
- Baby. let me
hold you.

1571
01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:18.107
- Ho. ho. ho!

1572
01:22:19.369 --> 01:22:20.544
Merry Christmas.

1573
01:22:20.587 --> 01:22:22.807
Have you been a good
girl this year. Francie?

1574
01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:25.462
What do you want for Christmas?

1575
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:28.769
- I already have it.

1576
01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:30.510
merry Christmas

1577
01:22:30.554 --> 01:22:32.469
merry Christmas

1578
01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:35.951
and a happy new year

1579
01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:39.824
wherever you are

1580
01:22:39.867 --> 01:22:43.436
and a happy new year

1581
01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.134
merry Christmas

1582
01:22:45.177 --> 01:22:47.049
merry Christmas

1583
01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:50.487
and a happy new year

1584
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:53.011
merry Christmas

1585
01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:55.013
- When I was a little girl.

1586
01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:57.798
I was sure that Annedore's
was a magical place.

1587
01:22:57.842 --> 01:23:00.410
And if you look in the window...

1588
01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:02.064
