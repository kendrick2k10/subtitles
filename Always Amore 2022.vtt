00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.580
The festival goes for two weeks.
so we can go another time.

186
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.581
Thanks. Mom.

187
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.517
Sure.

188
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.555
I am so sorry. sir.

189
00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.924
but your room won't be ready
for another hour.

190
00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.793
Oh. That's okay.

191
00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.194
While you're waiting.

192
00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.963
might I suggest walking over
to the Artisan Festival?

193
00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:14.567
It's a wonderful event
and today's the first day.

194
00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:17.637
Okay. Yeah.
I'll check it out. Why not?

195
00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:18.571
Thanks.

196
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.074
[♪♪]

197
00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.453
[♪♪]

198
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.306
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

199
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.675
I just wanted to see
how it was going so far.

200
00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:58.044
Great. Everyone really seems
to like the new fudge.

201
00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:00.213
Where's Sof?

202
00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.215
She's off with her friends.

203
00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.183
Didn't want to come with me.

204
00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:05.218
Oh...

205
00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.786
Don't worry.

206
00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:07.854
She'll magically reappear
once she gets hungry.

207
00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.255
I know it's hard. El.

208
00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.690
but she's getting
more independent--

209
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.092
it's a good thing.
means she's growing up.

210
00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:14.794
Tch.

211
00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.329
You are a good friend.

212
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.797
[chuckles]

213
00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.699
-Hi there.
-Hi.

214
00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.869
Would you like to try a sample?
This is our new hazelnut fudge.

215
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:25.204
Every ingredient
comes right from the island.

216
00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:28.007
This is literally the best
chocolate in the entire country.

217
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.709
Okay.

218
00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.711
Ginny's family's been
making this since the 1920s.

219
00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:32.945
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow.

220
00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.847
Hundred-year-old chocolate?
Looks great.

221
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:37.083
It's a life-altering
experience.

222
00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:39.785
Okay. might be overselling it
a little bit now.

223
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.622
You are being kind of pushy.

224
00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.090
I'm just trying to help.

225
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.725
No. no. It worked.

226
00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.194
Just fair warning.
I'm not a "hazelnut" guy.

227
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.130
Until now.

228
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.699
-Can I get a bag?
-Yes.

229
00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.034
-How much do I owe you?
-Ten.

230
00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.202
Did I tell you.
or did I tell you?

231
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.670
You told me.

232
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.237
I hope you're paying
your friend a commission.

233
00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.672
Of course.

234
00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:00.806
Mm. Winner.

235
00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:01.674
[chuckles]

236
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.244
You grow up here?

237
00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:06.812
Ginny did.

238
00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:09.982
Actually. we met as freshmen
at UConn.

239
00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.751
Loudest roommate ever.

240
00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:14.320
Well. I had to be loud
to drown out your ukulele.

241
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.055
No. you didn't.

242
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:19.125
Oh. it's okay.
No shame. No shame here.

243
00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.227
I. too. also went through
an ironic-ukulele phase.

244
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.261
How many songs you learn?

245
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.230
Uh. one.

246
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.932
"What a Wonderful World."

247
00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.233
How did you know that?

248
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.335
It's the only song
I learned.

249
00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.637
[laughs]

250
00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.238
[woman] Hey. Ginny.

251
00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.673
Hi!

252
00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.575
Wow. This is
a friendly place. huh?

253
00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:38.911
Yeah. that was one of
the first things I noticed

254
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.180
when I came here to visit Ginny
on a road trip 13 years ago.

255
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.082
It's a really special place.

256
00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.817
Pretty much
as soon as I got here.

257
00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.285
I knew this is where I belonged.

258
00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.787
The free chocolate
doesn't hurt. though. right?

259
00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:48.421
Well. obviously.

260
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.922
Here you go.

261
00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.057
Thank you.
Oh. keep that.

262
00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.391
Oh. thanks.

263
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:55.027
Just try not to eat all that
in one sitting.

264
00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:56.696
Oh. I absolutely will.

265
00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.099
-[reminder alert beeps]
-Oh. Ginny?

266
00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:01.734
I gotta go.
I got a meeting.

267
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.835
[Ben] I got a meeting.
too. actually.

268
00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.804
It was a pleasure meeting you.

269
00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:06.072
Yeah. you too.

270
00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.306
Thank you for the chocolate.

271
00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:08.841
Of course.

272
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.976
-You guys take care.
-Bye.

273
00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:13.679
Okay. Wish me luck.

274
00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.214
I have to go meet

275
00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.316
with this restaurant consultant
that Richard recommended.

276
00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.884
You can't leave yet.

277
00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.686
We haven't even talked
about ukulele guy.

278
00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:22.288
There's nothing to talk about.

279
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.990
I was trying to help
my best friend make a sale.

280
00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:28.060
If we have to close Cibo.
will you hire me?

281
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.429
Yes. But I know
I'm not gonna have to.

282
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.167
Good luck.

283
00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:52.785
[♪♪]

284
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:02.728
[Elizabeth] Hey.

285
00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:04.730
Me again.

286
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.432
You look lost.

287
00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:08.334
Yeah. Yeah. I got
a special talent

288
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.468
for starting out
in the wrong direction

289
00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.770
using this walking app.

290
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.104
Well. I can probably help you.

291
00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.239
Where are you going?

292
00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.074
Uh. Il Cibo è Vita.

293
00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.776
You know it?

294
00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:19.445
Of... course I do.

295
00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.447
Everyone does.

296
00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.349
I mean. it's probably

297
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:26.118
the best Italian restaurant
in the Pacific Northwest.

298
00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.154
I mean. maybe even
the entire country.

299
00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:29.822
Okay. Well...

300
00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.090
I was told it used to be.

301
00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:33.826
Straight down that way.
turn left.

302
00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:34.860
two doors down on the right.

303
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.063
[♪♪]

304
00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:52.311
[♪♪]

305
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.312
Can I help you?

306
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.186
You're Elizabeth Campisi.

307
00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:02.054
I am.

308
00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.790
And Marco Campisi
was my husband.

309
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.392
I'm so sorry for your loss.

310
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.560
There's nothing harder.

311
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.361
Thank you.

312
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.864
And I want to apologize
if I was harsh back there.

313
00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.566
I didn't mean to imply
that Cibo was not good.

314
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.935
Well. you didn't imply it.

315
00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:18.137
You flat-out said it.

316
00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.539
To be fair. you could've
told me who you were.

317
00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:22.241
I guess I wanted to see
what I was up against

318
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.009
and now I know.

319
00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:31.851
Ms. Campisi?

320
00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.385
I'm here to help.

321
00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.054
Believe it or not.
I'm on your side.

322
00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.990
Together. you and I can
help Cibo find its way again.

323
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.359
By changing everything about it
that made it great?

324
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.294
By identifying the things
that might be holding you back.

325
00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:45.965
And what if.
when you're done.

326
00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:47.533
there's nothing left?

327
00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:50.436
I promised Marco that I would
keep his vision alive.

328
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.404
and keep
our Cibo family together.

329
00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:54.940
Everyone here is counting on me.

330
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.010
Look. I've been doing this
a very long time.

331
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.112
Believe me when I say
that I understand

332
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.614
that the restaurant
is not just brick and mortar.

333
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.149
it's your heart
and your soul.

334
00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.851
Yes.
And so is everyone inside it.

335
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.119
I won't forget that.

336
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.988
Okay.

337
00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:13.259
So. do I just tell my staff
you're in charge now. or what?

338
00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.427
No. no. You just keep doing
what you normally do.

339
00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.396
I'll be observing the front
and the back of the house

340
00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:20.199
until I get an understanding
of what I'm dealing with here.

341
00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.468
What you're "dealing with"

342
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.603
is the vision of Marco Campisi.

343
00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:28.040
the greatest chef to ever
come out of Northern Italy.

344
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.277
[Elizabeth chuckles]
Ben. this is. uh. Chef Antonio.

345
00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.312
He came here to Bainbridge
with Marco all those years ago.

346
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.247
as his protege.

347
00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.283
It's a pleasure
to meet you. Antonio.

348
00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:40.219
I've heard wonderful things
about you from Richard.

349
00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:42.221
I gotta say.
I admire your willingness

350
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.557
to stay faithful
to Marco's original recipes--

351
00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.357
it's a stand-up thing to do.

352
00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:48.027
Everything I am.
I owe to that man.

353
00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.429
It's the least I can do.

354
00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.466
Well. I am very excited
to try everything for myself.

355
00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.901
What do you say we start

356
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:56.936
with three of
Cibo's best-selling dishes?

357
00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.204
-Yeah?
-Right now?

358
00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.506
Right now.
No time like the present.

359
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.474
I'm not sure we'll have time
before the dinner rush.

360
00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:03.676
I wouldn't call it
a "rush."

361
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.077
Carla.

362
00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.480
You know. I think
we can make that work--

363
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.548
-Good.
-if we start right away.

365
00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:15.321
Good afternoon. everybody.

366
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.189
My name is Ben Elliott.

367
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.924
and my job is simply

368
00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.093
to help restaurants
reach their full potential.

369
00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.661
Now. without sounding too proud.

370
00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.964
I have had some success
all over the world.

371
00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.066
and there's no reason why
we can't do the same thing here.

372
00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.400
with a beautiful place
like Cibo.

373
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.103
Is he waiting for us to cheer
or something?

374
00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:33.172
I can hear you.

375
00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:37.309
Uh... I think he might
actually be here to help.

376
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:40.179
so. let's give him a chance.
okay. guys?

377
00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.580
Thank you.

378
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.948
Antonio.
you want to get us going?

379
00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:43.983
Okay. everyone.

380
00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:45.417
we'll start with the antipasti--

381
00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:46.518
go prepare the bruschetta.

382
00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:48.587
I'll get started
on the carne cruda.

383
00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:50.422
I want everyone else either
on prep or out of the way.

384
00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.057
Adesso!
Let's go!

385
00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.293
[♪♪]

386
00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:56.395
Thanks. everybody.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

387
00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.596
[Antonio] Coagulated before
you put it in the pasta. okay?

388
00:14:57.596 --> 00:15:02.167

390
00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:20.319
[Elizabeth] Most of our guests
begin with the antipasti board--

391
00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:24.156
bruschetta. carne cruda.
piave cheese.

392
00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.558
Here is
a butternut squash risotto--

393
00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:27.760
all of the squash

394
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.728
is sourced locally
here on the island.

395
00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:32.131
Next up.
we have a customer favorite--

396
00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:36.068
fresh lobster ravioli
with crabmeat cream sauce.

397
00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:39.405
Finally.
Marco's signature dish--

398
00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:43.008
this is tagliolini with
a sun-dried tomato pesto.

399
00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:45.611
It's an homage to his roots
in Northwest Italy.

400
00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.519
Mm. Hmm.

401
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.522
It's incredible. isn't it?

402
00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.424
[Ben] Yeah. it's delicious.
Absolutely.

403
00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:01.126
The tomatoes are flown in.
direct from Piemonte.

404
00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.194
Italy?

405
00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.529
That seems incredibly expensive

406
00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.130
for something
you can source locally. no?

407
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.333
Well. the thing is.
this dish.

408
00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.235
including
these particular tomatoes.

409
00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.571
this is what
made Marco famous.

410
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.974
So we can't change it.

411
00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:19.578
Promise me
you won't ask me to change it.

412
00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:23.215
Well. I can't
make any promises.

413
00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:24.717
but I'll do my best
to make it work.

414
00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:28.454
The other thing here
is I see that the tomatoes

415
00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:29.621
are being used on...

416
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:31.657
five other dishes

417
00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.792
that aren't selling
nearly as well.

418
00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:36.395
The best thing we can do here
is to simplify this entire menu.

419
00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.163
Or maybe we can just get rid
of the whole thing

420
00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.498
and serve spaghetti
with sauce from a can?

421
00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:41.066
That would save lots of money.

422
00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.801
We will take a look

423
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.270
at our sun-dried tomato
expenditures.

424
00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:47.539
Thank you.

425
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:52.144
Is this the way the tables
have always been arranged?

426
00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.412
Yes.

427
00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:55.447
Huh.

428
00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.182
What are you writing?

429
00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:59.718
It's just shorthand.
so I remember my thoughts.

430
00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.787
So you're having thoughts
that you aren't sharing with me?

431
00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.288
Because I would like
to hear them...

432
00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:05.090
if we're "in this together."

433
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.825
We are. We are.

434
00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.394
I've just found it best

435
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.162
not to hit my clients
with all the ideas at once.

436
00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:11.597
Tends to make 'em
feel overwhelmed.

437
00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:14.166
I've already been overwhelmed
for the last three years.

439
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:20.539
Elizabeth. can you and I
go talk somewhere alone?

440
00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.507
-That's a good idea.
-Okay.

441
00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.442

that I was telling you about.

This is Marco's mother.
Signora Campisi.

It's an honor to meet you.

447
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.596
I'm so sorry
for the loss of your son.

448
00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.365
Not as sorry as you will be

449
00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:49.668
if you try to change
the tagliolini recipe.

450
00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:51.603
You heard us
talking about that?

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:52.738
Sì.

452
00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.341

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:57.676
You have my word.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.346
Grazie.

Well. enjoy your dinner. Nonna.

456
00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:07.352
So I thought you said
you couldn't make promises.

457
00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:09.621
I know.
But that was kind of scary.

458
00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:19.364
Can we just start over?

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.166

So. how did you end up
doing this for a living?

462
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:32.578
Uh. in college.
I worked at a restaurant

463

to keep its doors open.

it worked.

466

The success
got a lot of attention.

467
00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.820
and I guess
I found my calling.

468
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.823
Did you ever want to open
a restaurant of your own?

469
00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:48.760
Uh. yeah. Yeah. Almost did.
Yeah. San Diego.

470
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.262
Didn't work out.

Listen. um.

to the festival.

[Ben] We should also consider

540
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.023
starting an aperitivo hour
with wine pairings.

541
00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:06.925
But I thought you wanted
to streamline the menu.

542
00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.560
Yes. to make room

543
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.663
for new specials
that are easy to promote.

544
00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.532
And before you go blind
trying to read what I wrote.

545
00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:14.733
what I wrote was.

546
00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.702
"open-concept kitchen--"
question mark.

547
00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.537
Open-concept kitchen?

548
00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.439
-That's right.
-Marco used to say

549
00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:23.041
open kitchens make him feel like
an exhibit at the zoo--

550
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:25.143
like a monkey with knives
and a white hat.

551
00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:26.845
Okay. Well. look.

552
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.847
I've had the pleasure of
watching you cook. Antonio--

553
00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.816
and you've got
a rhythm and a flow.

554
00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:32.584
It's like watching a conductor
with a symphony.

555
00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:34.419
Why not let people be a part of
something beautiful like that?

556
00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:36.054
It's just not
what Marco wanted.

557
00:22:36.054 --> 00:22:37.789
Excuse me.
I need to get more olive oil.

558
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:39.424
Hey. what do you mean?
Where's the rest of it?

559
00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:41.026
Well. I was supposed
to get it yesterday.

560
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.561
but after making
the menu samples for Ben.

561
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.695
I didn't get the chance.

562
00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.163
Who's your supplier?

563
00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:46.765
Signore Petrunti.

564
00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:49.101
He's not an official supplier.
per se--

565
00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:52.003
he's a friend of Nonna Campisi's
from the old country

566
00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:54.639
and his olive oil
is the best of the best.

567
00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.508
-I'll run out.
-Actually. no.

568
00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:57.943
It's almost your break.

569
00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.044
Um. we'll just go.

570
00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:01.780
[Antonio] Are you sure?

571
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.983
You know what you have to do?

572
00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:07.719
I know.

573
00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:08.887
I'll be fine.

574
00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:12.691
Come on.

575
00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:14.593
[♪♪]

576
00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.930
So...

577
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.099
what exactly do you have to do
to get this special olive oil?

578
00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:23.502
Well. Signore Petrunti has

579
00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:25.137
his own unique way
of doing business.

580
00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.406
It's a very delicate
negotiation.

581
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.675
-Okay.
-[laughs] Just come with me.

582
00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:33.745
[indistinct exchange]

583
00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:34.780
-You got to do something.
-Signore.

584
00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:37.416
Elizabeth!

585
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.919
How are you?

586
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.888
Ah. fine. fine.

587
00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.222
Where's Antonio?

588
00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.557
He's at the restaurant.

589
00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:46.925
I'll be handling
the order today.

590
00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.260
Who's this guy?

591
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.028
I'm Ben. How're you doing?
Nice to meet you.

592
00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:51.797
He's just observing.

593
00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:54.266
You know how this works. huh?

594
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.568
The lower your score.
the more you pay.

595
00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:57.702
-Capisce?
-Of course.

596
00:23:57.702 --> 00:23:59.638
Bene.

597
00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:03.108
[♪♪]

598
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.614
Scopa!

599
00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.650
[laughs]

600
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.151
Is she winning?

601
00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.152
Yes.

602
00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:16.922
[♪♪]

603
00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:17.722
[slaps card down]

604
00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:18.890
Scopa!

605
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.292
[sighs grudgingly]

606
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.461
[Elizabeth laughs]

607
00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:26.598
[♪♪]

608
00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:32.270
Scopa!

609
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.139
-[laughs]
-[grumbles]

610
00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:37.008
I'm just getting lucky.

611
00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.844
Mm.

612
00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.746
Here's your price.

613
00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.851
No.

614
00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:47.853
That was the price last time.

615
00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:51.289
and I know Antonio didn't win
as many rounds as me.

616
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:54.025
[♪♪]

617
00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.096
[inhales tersely]

618
00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.664
[sighs]

619
00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.766
[♪♪]

620
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:13.178
[exhales slowly]

621
00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:14.679
You're good at this. huh?

622
00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.780
[Elizabeth chuckles]

623
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.883
Go get her a case of olive oil.

624
00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:22.787
Elizabeth. it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

625
00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.890
We'll see you next month.

626
00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:29.194
Is this gonna be enough?

627
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.929
-Grazie.
-Can we have the rest delivered?

628
00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:32.731
Of course.

629
00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:34.733
-Grazie.
-G
razie.

630
00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:35.867
[thumps Ben's back]

631
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:38.169
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

632
00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:40.071
Okay.

633
00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:41.940
That was
a little bit impressive.

634
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.309
[laughs] Scopa's not
that hard to learn.

635
00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:45.810
Not the game!

636
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.811
-The way you charmed those guys.
-Charmed them?

637
00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:50.048
And stood your ground
with Signore Petrunti.

638
00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.684
and worked him over for--
for his olive oil.

639
00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:54.185
Can you do the same thing
with tomatoes. though?

640
00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:57.322
See? That's your trouble. Ben.

641
00:25:57.322 --> 00:26:01.626
You still think this is
about overhead and profits.

642
00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:04.629
Unfortunately. when it's all
said and done. it is.

643
00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:06.998
The question is. is how do
we get to where we need to be?

644
00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:08.934
Well. whatever we do.

645
00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:11.369
it can't come at the expense
of what made Cibo great.

646
00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.371
It's the relationships.

647
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.840
Everything we do
comes from the heart.

648
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.142
and I don't want
to lose that.

649
00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:20.111
Otherwise.
what are we even doing here?

650
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:23.281
Aside from basking in the glory
of your sweet. sweet victories?

651
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:25.150
You know what I mean.

652
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.053
I do.

653
00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:30.121
All right. These bad boys
are nice and safe.

654
00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:31.990
Thank you.

655
00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.862
Do you want me
to drop you off at home?

656
00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:39.130
Or your place.
wherever you're staying?

657
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.299
Yeah. the Bainbridge Pines Inn.

658
00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.068
If you don't mind.

659
00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:46.137
I just realized. I don't even
know where home is for you.

660
00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:48.106
I don't have one of those.
I don't think.

661
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.175
I do have an apartment
in New York.

662
00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:51.977
where I leave all my stuff
when I'm gone.

663
00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.278
Does that count?

664
00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:55.046
Don't you ever want
to settle down somewhere?

665
00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:57.816
I came close once.

666
00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:58.850
When I was engaged.

667
00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.251
Didn't work out.

668
00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:02.420
Oh. I'm sorry.

669
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.422
Oh. it's fine. It's okay.

670
00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:05.890
It's in the past.

671
00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:11.029
Don't you get tired.
moving from place to place?

672
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:14.065
No. no. I love what I do.

673
00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:16.468
There are few things better
in this world

674
00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:19.037
than seeing your client realize
that everything's gonna be okay.

675
00:27:22.273 --> 00:27:24.109
Or maybe your job

676
00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:27.712
is just an elaborate ruse to get
free food all over the world.

677
00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:28.847
Uh-oh. She's on to me.

678
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.089
Sofia. you're gonna
be late for school!

679
00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:40.358
I don't feel good.

680
00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:41.326
I don't think I should
go to school today.

681
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:43.762
Oh. no.

682
00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:45.797
Do you have a cough?
A sore throat?

683
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.501
Let me see if you have a fever.

684
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:52.270
It's just a stomach ache.
I just don't want to go. okay?

685
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.272
Oh.

686
00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:57.409
Sofia. did something happen
at school with Anna and Mia?

687
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:59.778
No. I totally avoided them.

688
00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.680
I think maybe
something happened.

689
00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.884
Lunch was hard.

690
00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:08.153
Mm. yeah. I bet it was.

691
00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.188
Who did you end up
sitting with?

692
00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.390
I went to the art room
and painted.

693
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.092
Sweetheart. I'm sure
there was someone you know

694
00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:15.360
that you could have
had lunch with.

695
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.295
But what if nobody wants me
to sit with them?

696
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.766
Okay. I know this is scary.

697
00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:24.836
but. sometimes.
if we want things to change.

698
00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:27.338
we have to be the one
to make the first step.

699
00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:32.811
[♪♪]

700
00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.481

[line rings]

702
00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:45.390
Good morning.

703
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.425
Good morning!
I'm at the restaurant.

704
00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:49.794
It's locked.

705
00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:51.129
Well. that's because
we're closed on Mondays.

706
00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:53.465
Remember?
We give the staff a day off.

707
00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:54.466
because they all work weekends.

708
00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.267
Well. that's very kind of you

709
00:28:56.267 --> 00:28:58.570
to be giving up
15% of your potential profit.

710
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.872
This is the way
we've always done it.

711
00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.041
It's part of why
the staff is so loyal.

712
00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.110
We're like a family.

713
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.978
In fact.
a lot of them come to my house

714
00:29:06.978 --> 00:29:08.246
for Monday Dinner.

715
00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.583
Everyone is invited.
and you can...

716

718

No. no. no.
I wouldn't want to impose.

719

I was just
throwing it out there.

720
00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:20.458
Then again.
it might not be a bad idea

a little bit better.

might come from.

723

So...

724
00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:28.133
it's like a business dinner.

725
00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:30.401
Yeah. Exactly.

a forgiving waistband.

So I was going
through my drawers.

this old recipe of Nonna's.

734
00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.092

738
00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.601
And chocolate is the one thing
I don't have.

where I could find some?

740

baking twice in one week.

When was the last time
you did that?

744
00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:15.547
I can't even remember.

745
00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:18.016
It had to be
before Marco and I opened Cibo.

746
00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.551
It's good to see you
finally finding the time

747
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:20.952
to do something
you love again.

748
00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:22.520
That's just it--
I don't have the time.

749
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.058
I just forgot to assign someone
to bring dessert tonight.

750
00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.061
and I already happened to have
most of the ingredients.

751
00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:33.031
Except I was thinking about
adding just a hint of espresso--

752

-Mm!

And I'm gonna make sure

755
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:38.403
that Ben knows
that I used local figs.

756
00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:41.372
because I want him to see
how much we value farm-to-table.

757
00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:43.408
That's why you suddenly
found the time to bake

We all want you to be happy.

that's a good idea.

897
00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:37.995
Antonio.

898
00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.463
We should at least consider

899
00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:40.398
adding this
to one of the specials.

900
00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:42.366
Refreshing the menu's

901
00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.768
one of the most important things
we can do here.

902
00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:44.936
Here.

903
00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.571
Ben. You stir.

904
00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:47.572
-Stir?
-Sì.

905
00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:48.873
Sure.

906
00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.442
Thank you.

907
00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:53.010
Tch-tch-tch-tch.

908
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.279
Let me show you something.

909
00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:57.415
Okay. Sure.

910
00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.317
You should do... like this.

911
00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:00.351
Yeah?

912
00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:04.722
You want me to lift it up
like that?

913
00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.057
Sì.

914
00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.326
Okay. I got that.
I can do that. No problem.

915
00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.860
Just do that.

916
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.562
-Bring it up like this. right?
-Mm.

917
00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.698
[chuckling]

918
00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:14.999
[laughter grows]

919
00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:17.602
She's messing with me?
Okay. Good.

920
00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:18.669
Appreciate that.

921
00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:19.737
It's okay.

922
00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:20.671
You want me to stir this
or not?

923
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.706
-No.
-No?

924
00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:23.975
[loud laughter]

925
00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:26.510
[Ben] No. I know
what you're doing.

926
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.320
Careful.
those are very long pieces.

927
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.923
Oh... ha. ha.

928
00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.324
What am I missing here?

929
00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:42.560
Nothing. Nothing.

930
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.862
Elizabeth here committed
one of the biggest sins

931
00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:46.030
in Italian cooking.

932
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.632
[Ben] Is that right?
What'd you do?

933
00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.567
-I did not.
-Did you use sauce from a jar?

934
00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:50.968
Worse!

935
00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.603
What could be worse than that?
Nonna. come on.

936
00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:55.373
Do we have to talk about this?

937
00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:56.841
It was ten years ago.

938
00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.543
Oh. I think this is the perfect
time to talk about this.

939
00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:00.444
What do you guys think?

940
00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:01.479
-Uh. yes.
-Mm-hmm.

941
00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.381
I do!

942
00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:05.416
She's in. Here we go!

943
00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.617
Okay. Fine.

944
00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:11.489
So... it was Nonna's
first time visiting

945
00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.491
and I wanted to impress her--

946
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.393
Oh. you impressed her.
all right.

947
00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:18.496
I could help in the kitchen--

948
00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.898
So when it came time to put
the spaghetti into the pot.

949
00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:22.500
Elizabeth took the pasta...

950
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.834
She held it over the pot...

951
00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.736
And before any of us
could stop her...

952
00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:29.540
I... broke the spaghetti
in two.

953
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.808
-Mom!
-[horrified groans]

954
00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.910
[Ben] Oh. no!

955
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.779
Even Sofia knows
you don't do that.

956
00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.614
Sofia's half-Italian.

957
00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:38.649
Oh. the cracking sound--

958
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.651
it was terrible.

959
00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:43.087
I almost fainted.

960
00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:45.656
-[laughing]
-[Ben] I'll bet you did.

961
00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:48.759
Well. needless to say.
I learned my lesson.

962
00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:49.927
Now...

963
00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:52.163
I cut my spaghetti
with scissors.

964
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.698
[laughter and jeering]

965
00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:55.333
[Ben] Okay. okay.

966
00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.035
Here. Have a little more

967
00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:59.704
No. no. no.
Grazie. grazie.

968
00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.705
Yeah. yeah.
you like the potatoes.

969
00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:01.806
This is where I draw the line.

970
00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:02.606
There's no more room in there.

971
00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.709
The secret
is to say you're full

972
00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.077
one helping
before you actually are.

973
00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.445
Mm-hmm.

974
00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.046
I wish I'd known that
an hour ago.

975
00:39:09.046 --> 00:39:10.081
[laughter]

976
00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:19.123
I'm-- I'm gonna start getting
everything ready for dessert.

977
00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:21.926
[Ben] Okay.

978
00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:24.362
[♪♪]

979
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.566
It's okay to start. Ben.

980
00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:30.434
-Mangia.
-N
onna.

981
00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:32.570
Finally. All right.

982
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.038
Mm.

983
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.209
-[Ben] Nonna?
-Mm-hmm?

984
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:41.479
This might be one of
the best desserts I've had.

985
00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:42.847
Now I know
where your son gets it.

986
00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:44.648
I did not bake this.

987
00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:45.983
You?

988
00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:47.017
Mm-mm.

989
00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.487
[shocked] No...

990
00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.888
[laughs]

991
00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.990
You've been holding out on me.
You bake?

992
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.459
I used to.
when I was little.

993
00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.027
I'll try it.

994
00:39:57.027 --> 00:39:59.630
Now it's just sort of a hobby

995
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.732
that I never seem
to find time to do.

996
00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:03.601
Elizabeth! Ooh!

997
00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.870
Whose recipe is this?

998
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.105
You know. actually. it's
a twist on your recipe. Nonna.

999
00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.173
I hope you don't mind.

1000
00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:11.041
I changed it up
just a little bit.

1001
00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.877
Of course. I don't mind.

1002
00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.912
Sometimes...

1003
00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:18.616
change makes the things better.

1004
00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:22.153
You made it your own.

1005
00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.587
Ben fatto!

1006
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.122
Excuse me?

1007
00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.424
[laughter]

1008
00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.827
Ben--

1009
00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:31.896
"ben fatto."
it means "well done."

1010
00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.531
Ahh.

1011
00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:34.665
Well. in that case...

1012
00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:35.866
Ben is a fatso.
Come here.

1013
00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.935
[laughter]

1014
00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:40.271
No. I can't.
I can't have any more.

1015
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.039
You guys are gonna
have to roll me out of here.

1016
00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:44.008
However. I am very glad

1017
00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:46.644
that you made time
to bake this today.

1018
00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:48.078
We all are.

1019
00:40:48.078 --> 00:40:49.747
Yeah.

1020
00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:51.849
Not a bad way to spend
a Monday night.

1021
00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.585
No. it's not.
[slurps]

1022
00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.053
I can't remember the last time
I felt this way.

1023
00:40:57.888 --> 00:40:59.924
About a meal. I meant.
I can't even describe it.

1024
00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.058
We call it.

1025
00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:06.297
La gioia della tavola.

1026
00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:09.066
"The joys of the table."

1027
00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:10.835
That's lovely.
That's lovely.

1028
00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:12.069
You guys have
a wonderful family.

1029
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:13.237
I hope you know that.

1030
00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.973
I didn't have a big family
growing up.

1031
00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:17.908
Did not realize
what I was missing

1032
00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.143
until I came here.

1033
00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:22.213
[♪♪]

1034
00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:29.487
That means so much.
Thank you.

1035
00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:32.823
[exhales deeply]

1036
00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:33.924
Well...

1037
00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:35.626
that was. without a doubt.

1038
00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:37.261
the best business dinner
I've ever had.

1039
00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:39.797
I almost forgot
that's what it was.

1040
00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.131
Yeah.

1041
00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.500
[takes a deep breath]

1042
00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:49.507
Thank you.

1043
00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.011
Thank you for tonight.

1044
00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.883
-Uh. goodnight.
-See you tomorrow.

1045
00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.017
Okay.

1046
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:04.188
[♪♪]

1047
00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.266
Oh. Richard. Hi.

1048
00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:16.867
I'm so sorry.

1049
00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:18.135
I thought our status meeting
was this afternoon.

1050
00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:19.203
I needed to see you sooner.

1051
00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:21.972
Things have changed.

1052
00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:23.974
Well. they're about to--

1053
00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.876
isn't that the whole point
of all this?

1054
00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.978
Actually... [sighs]

1055
00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.179
the other restaurant group

1056
00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:31.215
moved up the deadline
on their offer.

1057
00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.217
They need an answer
in three weeks.

1058
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.019
Three weeks?

1059
00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:37.688
That's not enough time
to turn Cibo around.

1060
00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:40.691
Even if we followed
all of Ben's suggestions.

1061
00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:41.825
that's not enough time.

1062
00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.160
I know.

1063
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.929
Which is why
I'm going to take their offer

1064
00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.764
while it's still on the table.

1065
00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.933
[dejected sigh]

1066
00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.734
I have no choice.

1067
00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:52.570
I'm sorry.

1068
00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:59.944
You can't do this to us.

1069
00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.947
After everything
we've been through?

1070
00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:06.350
I mean. what am I--
what am I gonna tell everyone?

1071
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.752
What am I gonna I tell Sofia?

1072
00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.387
You're taking away

1073
00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:12.323
the only thing
we have left of Marco.

1074
00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:14.224
Believe me...

1075
00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.660
I have no choice here.

1076
00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.696
Times are tough for everyone.

1077
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.666
How much are they offering?

1078
00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:24.935
250.000.

1079
00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:27.171
Well. I don't want to sell.

1080
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:30.240
I will take out a loan
and buy out your share.

1081
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.809
If you could do that.

1082
00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.311
nothing would
make me happier.

1083
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.814
But...

1084
00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.282
it's not realistic.

1085
00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:40.851
Why not?

1086
00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:42.386
I've been in business
a long time

1087
00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:44.221
and no bank
is going to lend money

1088
00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.956
to a business
that's already on the brink.

1089
00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:49.960
I truly wish
things were different.

1090
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.730
It has been a tough year...

1091
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.399
and I really have no choice.
Elizabeth.

1092
00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:59.003
I understand.

1093
00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.938
I'm so sorry.

1094
00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:02.239
Thank you.

1098
00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:20.290
Thank you.

1099
00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:25.396
Good morning. Mr. Elliott.

1100
00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:26.830
Good morning. Charlotte.

1101
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.332
Early start today?

1102
00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.733
Yeah. I thought
I'd walk around town

1103
00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:31.001
before I head into Cibo.

1104
00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:33.003
Huh. The island's really
growing on you. eh?

1105
00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:35.105
Yeah. I suppose it is.

1106
00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:36.206
Have a good day. okay?

1107
00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.509
Don't work too hard!

1108
00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.977

1113

1115
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.719
Oh.

1116
00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:24.922
Hi.

1117
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.125
I heard about the offer
getting moved up.

1118
00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.159
that Richard's taking it.

1119
00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:30.461
Yeah.

1120
00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:33.097
So I guess that means
you're out of a job.

1121
00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:36.200
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried about you.

1122
00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:38.836
I'll be fine.

1123
00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:42.372
I just need $125.000
in the next three weeks.

1124
00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:44.575
You speak to the bank?

1125
00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:46.877
Apparently. it will take
some kind of miracle

1126
00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:49.012
for them to loan me
that type of money.

1127
00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:50.114
No. no. no.

1128
00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:52.082
They just need
a compelling reason.

1129
00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.450
We can still give them that.

1130
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.052
"We"?

1131
00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:58.088
Aren't you moving on?

1132
00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:00.491
Never left a job
until it was done.

1133
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.226
We're not done yet.

1134
00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.929
I can't pay you the type
of money that Richard did.

1135
00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:09.266
It's on the house.

1136
00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:11.101
Do you do this
for all your clients?

1137
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.036
Uh...

1138
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.140

You're here early.

1143
00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:29.553
I. uh. picked up
some fresh salmon

1144
00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:31.221
from a friend of mine
this morning

1145
00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:33.290
and thought I'd play around
with some recipes.

1146
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.526
Well. if it's anything
like you made the other night.

1147
00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:37.427
I would be honored
to be your test subject.

1148
00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:39.897
What do we got?

1149
00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:42.299
We have. uh. pan-roasted
salmon puttanesca...

1150
00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.502
Hmm.

1151
00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:47.971
Pan-roasted salmon
with herb gnocchetti

1152
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.239
in an olive vinaigrette...

1153
00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:50.407
Okay.

1154
00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:52.910
And salmon alla stimpirata.

1155
00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.212
Hmm.

1156
00:46:57.514 --> 00:47:01.151
Antonio. I've had some of
the finest cuisine in the world.

1157
00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.253
These three rank right up there.

1158
00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:04.922
Thank you.

1159
00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.123
So we'll put them
on the menu.

1160
00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:07.157
No.

1161
00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:11.161
Antonio.
you're killing me here.

1162
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:14.231
Look. I understand
why Elizabeth is reluctant

1163
00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:15.999
to make changes
to what Cibo did in the past.

1164
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.434
but you seem just as reluctant.
my friend.

1165
00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:19.036
Why is that?

1166
00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:21.405
Don't you want to make
a name for yourself?

1167
00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:22.439
Don't you want more?

1168
00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.942
What I have here

1169
00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.177
is already more than
I could have ever dreamed of.

1170
00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.912
Okay.

1171
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.582
Back in Italy.

1172
00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:34.218
I was always getting myself
into trouble.

1173
00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.587
I knew cooking was my way out.
but...

1174
00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:39.256
I made some mistakes.

1175
00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:43.260
I lost the money for tuition
at culinary school.

1176
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.995
When Marco found this out.

1177
00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.064
he paid my way.

1178
00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:48.198
[Ben chuckles softly]

1179
00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:49.533
When he asked me

1180
00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:52.002
if I'd come to the U.S.
to open Cibo.

1181
00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:54.972
it was the easiest decision
I ever made.

1182
00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.341
Everything I have

1183
00:47:57.341 --> 00:48:00.944
is all because Marco Campisi
believed in me.

1184
00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:05.515
My way of thanking him
is to keep his legacy alive.

1185
00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:08.085
I understand.

1186
00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:13.156
But isn't your talent...

1187
00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.558
part of that legacy. too?

1188
00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.693
This is my decision. Ben.

1189
00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:19.429
This is how
I've chosen to honor him.

1190
00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:24.101
You can't honor him
from a closed kitchen. Antonio.

1191
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.270
Listen to me.

1192
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:29.306
You are the key
to everything here.

1193
00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:31.708
Your food

1194
00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:33.543
is how we bring Cibo back.

1195
00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:37.547
Thank you for saying that. Ben.

1196
00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:39.549
but I don't think Mrs. Campisi

1197
00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:41.585
would ever be okay
with changing the menu.

1198
00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.387
I would never ask her to.

1199
00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:46.256
It's her link to Marco.
just like it is for me.

1200
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.991
Okay. Well. let me talk to her.

1201
00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:49.326
What if she says no?

1202
00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.227
Don't worry about that.

1203
00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.261
You...

1204
00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:53.397
just be ready.

1205
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:55.999
Okay.

1206
00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.234
[hopeful] Okay.

1207
00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.769
Okay!

1208
00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.270
Okay. pal.

1209
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.706
All right. Progress!

1210
00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:10.681
You couldn't have
just said. "Ben?"

1211
00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:14.184
Guy asked for a name
for the cup.

1212
00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:15.686
"Cuppy."

1213
00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.254
[laughs]

1214
00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.555
I think I would've gone
with "Steve".

1215
00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:19.957
Nah. Cuppy's cuter.

1216
00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:26.763
So. I'm guessing
you didn't want to meet today

1217
00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:29.499
just to talk about
paper products. did you?

1218
00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.301
No. There's something else.

1219
00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:33.470
Of course. there is.

1220
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.672
What is that? What's wrong?
Did something happen?

1221
00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.708
It's just. no. I'm...
[sighing]

1222
00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:40.577
I'm just starting to see
the writing on the wall.

1223
00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:43.513
and it's a sign.

1224
00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:45.482
and it says. "for lease".

1225
00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:47.584
Not if I can help it.

1226
00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:50.087
I talked to my friend. Gail.

1227
00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.588
She's the loan officer
at the bank.

1228
00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:53.123
and Richard was right.

1229
00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:55.359
They are not
going to lend us a dime

1230
00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.527
unless we have the same type
of buzz we did before.

1231
00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:58.628
Ah.

1232
00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.263
Let's be honest. Ben.

1233
00:50:00.263 --> 00:50:02.632
It's impossible to get that kind
of buzz in three months.

1234
00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:04.768
let alone three weeks.

1235
00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.269
Not impossible.

1236
00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:08.472
Hard. but not impossible.

1237
00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.777
Look. Elizabeth. you have
everything that you need

1238
00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:15.545
to get back on top.
right in front of you.

1239
00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.414
You got the best chef
on the island.

1240
00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:20.317
maybe even the entire region.
in your kitchen.

1241
00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:23.220
and all you have to do
is give him the freedom

1242
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.455
to show everybody else
what we already know.

1243
00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:28.658
And what we know
is that he's a culinary genius.

1244
00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:31.795
Mm-hmm. well.
he learned from the best...

1245
00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:34.798
and. honestly?

1246
00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:37.167
He might be even better.

1247
00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:39.736
But I asked him.
two years ago.

1248
00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:42.172
if he wanted to put his dishes
on the menu.

1249
00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:45.409
he said no--
he wouldn't even discuss it.

1250
00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:47.144
I think.
if you asked him again.

1251
00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.345
you might get
a different answer.

1252
00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:50.313

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:54.751
But first. you need to give him
your blessing.

1254
00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:56.787
He needs to know
that you are okay

1255
00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.455
making this change.

1256
00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:05.662
Everyone keeps telling me
to move on. let go. change.

1257
00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:07.631
It's not that easy.

1258
00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:12.069
It's not like
I can just flip a switch.

1259
00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:18.408
I know.

1260
00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:20.343
Believe me. I know.

1261
00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:27.617
[♪♪]

1262
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:07.257
[♪♪]

1263
00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:29.379
[♪♪]

1264
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.283
Buon pomeriggio.
Nonna.

1265
00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:34.918
Mm. Mwah.

1266
00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:38.522
Tch. Eh?

1267
00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.525
I thought
the double-cheek-kiss thing

1268
00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:43.393
was reserved just for family.

1269
00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:44.628
Campisi rule--

1270
00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:46.863
you have
a family dinner with us.

1271
00:52:46.863 --> 00:52:49.366
you are family. so.

1272
00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.700
[chuckling]

1273
00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.871
Ah. ecco. It's done.

1274
00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:56.473
-Grazie. Nonna.
-We'd love to join you.

1275
00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:58.308
We have to talk to Antonio.
so we'll see you in a bit.

1276
00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:03.680
She doesn't know what's
going on with the business.

1277
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.482
-does she?
-I'll have to tell her soon.

1278
00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:06.850
She's not gonna like it
when she finds out

1279
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.286
Antonio's making
his own recipes. though.

1280
00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:13.924
[Nonna] Antonio is going
to be making his own recipes?

1281
00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.926
Nonna...

1282
00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.928
let me explain.

1283
00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:20.330
No need to explain.

1284
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.600
I always hoped you would
give Antonio a chance.

1285
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.835
[sighs]

1286
00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:29.005
I thought you would be upset.

1287
00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:32.609
I'm just surprised
it took that long.

1288
00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:37.681
Marco never would have wanted
his protege. his
protetto.

1289
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:41.952
to be making the same recipes
for his whole career.

1290
00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:46.022
He would've wanted him
to leave the nest and fly.

1291
00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:48.491
Why didn't you
say something sooner?

1292
00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:50.460
I mind my own business.

1293
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:54.397
Pretty good
for a mother-in-law. no?

1294
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:56.633
[chuckles] I don't know
what I'd do without you.

1295
00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.401
Mm!

1296
00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:01.705
Okay. Let's go
tell Antonio it's a "yes."

1297
00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:02.772
shall we?

1298
00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:03.773
Yes!

1299
00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:06.910
Thank you. Nonna.

1300
00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.514
No.

1301
00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:14.818
I made a promise to Marco
to keep things as they were.

1302
00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.553
So did I. Antonio.

1303
00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:17.988
but I think we were wrong.

1304
00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.723
I don't think this is
what Marco would have wanted

1305
00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:20.991
in the long run.

1306
00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:23.026
I can't just forget
about him. Elizabeth.

1307
00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:25.862
I create a new menu.
there's nothing left.

1308
00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:28.832
The menu's gonna have
a "Campisi Classic" section--

1309
00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:31.768
all of Marco's best dishes.
just as they were.

1310
00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:32.902
The rest is up to you.

1311
00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:35.338
This is how we honor the past

1312
00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:36.406
and embrace the future.

1313
00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.810
[♪♪]

1314
00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.586
Mrs. Campisi...

1315
00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.388
if you and Nonna
don't want me to do this.

1316
00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:52.756
I won't.

1317
00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:55.558
Nonna and I both think

1318
00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:58.295
that you deserve the chance
to shine.

1319
00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:02.599
I know that's what
Marco would've wanted

1320
00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.100
and I'm just sorry

1321
00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.568
that it took me
so long to realize it.

1322
00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:09.606
I've got this guy
to thank for that.

1323
00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.107
Just doing my job.

1324
00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:11.975
Thank you.

1325
00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:16.846
Both of you.

1326
00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.081
Of course.

1327
00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:20.917
The only trouble
is we have just three weeks

1328
00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.385
to get the word out.

1329
00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:24.454
and it would usually take months
to generate

1330
00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:26.623
the type of buzz
that we need.

1331
00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:28.625
Not if this man enters
the Battle of Bainbridge.

1332
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.527
The team from Coastside
in San Francisco.

1333
00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:33.029
they've won seven years
in a row.

1334
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:35.432
and they just received
their third Michelin star!

1335
00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:37.067
I don't think I'm ready.

1336
00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.436
I know you're ready.

1337
00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:40.637
[deep breath]

1338
00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:43.406
And so am I.

1339
00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:45.175
It's time we turned the corner.

1340
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.876
Okay.

1341
00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:50.447
[♪♪]

1342
00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:59.422
Thank you.

1343
00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.690
I just heard
about the festival!

1344
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.891
Congratulations. Antonio.

1345
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.793
-Grazie.
-I'm so happy for you.

1346
00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:04.894
Thank you.

1347
00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.698
This smells amazing.
What is it?

1348
00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:11.835
And can I have it all
and not share it with anyone?

1349
00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:13.603
It's a seared scallops

1350
00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.438
with corn pudding
and wild truffles.

1351
00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:17.140
over a roasted chicken broth.

1352
00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.775
Please. enjoy.

1353
00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:24.447
Mm.

1354
00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:27.684
Antonio. this is incredible.

1355
00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:30.086
I've never tasted
scallops like this before.

1356
00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:31.554
This is definitely
the recipe you should use

1357
00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:32.822
in the competition.

1358
00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.225
Oh. I can't make this
for the competition.

1359
00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:36.493
Why not?

1360
00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:38.661
I'm out of the truffles.

1361
00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:39.696
Let's go buy some more.

1362
00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:40.697
On me.

1363
00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:42.599
I appreciate that.

1364
00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.601
but there is nowhere
to buy them.

1365
00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:46.536
These truffles are
only harvested on this island.

1366
00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:49.706
and once they're gone.
they're gone.

1367
00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:51.775
Unless we want to go hunt
for any stragglers ourselves.

1368
00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:53.243
Talking about a truffle hunt?

1369
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:55.111
I thought this only
happened in Italy.

1370
00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:57.714
Uh. actually. the latitude
of Washington State

1371
00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:59.015
is the same

1372
00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.917
as the best truffle-growing
regions in Italy.

1373
00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:02.419
And probably
a tenth of the price.

1374
00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:06.656
What? It's a win-win.

1375
00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:07.924
-You're hopeless.
-I know. What do you want?

1376
00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.025
So...

1377
00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.493
let's go find some.

1378
00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:11.728
Ben. why don't you join me?

1379
00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.630
Absolutely.
Elizabeth?

1380
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.498
Oh. Uh...

1381
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.768
Ginny. do you want to join us?

1382
00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:20.637
I have to get back
to the store.

1383
00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:23.440
Okay. Then it's just us three.

1384
00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:26.576
[Antonio] Great.

1385
00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.545
[♪♪]

1386
00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.684
So. now you know
what to look for.

1387
00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:37.854
let's hope
we have some luck. huh?

1388
00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:39.155
Okay. you two try
this section over there--

1389
00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:40.223
Okay.

1390
00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:42.592
--and I'll look up here.

1391
00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:43.660
Andiamo.

1392
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.528
-Good luck.
-You too.

1393
00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:46.863
All right. let's see
what we can do here.

1394
00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:51.568
Hey. look.
I want to say thank you.

1395
00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:53.703
Why? For what?

1396
00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.305
For being so open
to all these changes.

1397
00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.574
The hardest part of my job

1398
00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:58.842
is getting someone
to be open to change

1399
00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.710
so that they can
help themselves.

1400
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.712
that and knowing when to push.

1401
00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.547
and not to push too far.

1402
00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:05.815
You've been really courageous

1403
00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.917
and I want
to thank you for that.

1404
00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:09.118
Well. I don't know.

1405
00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:12.021
I wasn't really open
to any changes at first.

1406
00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:14.657
Yeah. you were guarded.

1407
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:17.760
Understandable. given everything
that you've been through.

1408
00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:21.898
Not everybody's
as strong as you are.

1409
00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:25.101
I didn't really have a choice.

1410
00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.769
I had a lot of people
counting on me. and...

1411
00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.007
...then I realized
I could count on you.

1412
00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.911
Yeah. Absolutely.

1413
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.151
[Antonio] Whoo-hoo!

1414
00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:44.354
Ben! Elizabeth!

1415
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:46.189
Come. I found them.

1416
00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.790
[chuckles]

1417
00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.760
Should we go?

1418
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.595
Sure.

1419
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.164
[Ben] We're coming!

1420
00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:02.906
[♪♪]

1421
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.708
Sofia!

1422
00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.744
This is beautiful.

1423
00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:10.079
Wow!

1424
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.281
I wonder if my dad
would've liked it.

1425
00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:15.118
I'm sure
your dad would've loved it.

1426
00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:17.153
From what I'm told.
your dad was a true artist.

1427
00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:18.922
and so are you.

1428
00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:22.025
You're keeping his legacy alive.
You should be very proud.

1429
00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.393
There's one more box
in the back.

1430
00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:24.627
Yeah. okay.

1431
00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.229
Keep going.

1432
00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:28.965
Antonio!

1433
00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:31.200
Hey.

1434
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.336
I am so glad you're finally
entering the competition.

1435
00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.871
What took you so long?

1436
00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:37.707
Uh. I just wanted to make sure
that I was ready.

1437
00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:38.875
That we all were.

1438
00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.910
Mm! Well. I'm sure

1439
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:43.179
people will be very excited
to see what you can do.

1440
00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.747
I know Cibo needs a comeback.

1441
00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:47.050
I truly hope this is the start
of something big.

1442
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.751
Thank you. So do we.

1443
00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:50.253
Oh.

1444
00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.854
and what will you be offering
for the dessert portion?

1445
00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:54.223
We haven't decided yet.

1446
00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:57.327
Okay. yeah. well. let us know
as soon as you can.

1447
00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.128
Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you.

1448
01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:03.399
Is Christina gonna make
her zuccotto cake?

1449
01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.934
No. she just texted me.

1450
01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.970
She's already baking something
for Joli Plat.

1451
01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.171
Can she do that?

1452
01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.673
Yes. we're not
her only clients.

1453
01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.042
I am surprised you guys never
had an in-house pastry chef.

1454
01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.811
Well. we talked about
bringing someone in.

1455
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.045
but then Marco passed.

1456
01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:18.014
and we were just trying
to stay afloat.

1457
01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.816
Can you think
of anyone else in Seattle

1458
01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.284
who might be able to do it?

1459
01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:25.221
[♪♪]

1460
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.024
Why are the two of you
looking at me like that?

1461
01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:29.692
Because you should be
the person to make this dessert.

1462
01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:30.893
Me?

1463
01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.295
-Yeah.
-Those two cakes you made

1464
01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.064
were better than anything
Christina ever did.

1465
01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.166
They're so good. Mom!

1466
01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.035
And professional quality.

1467
01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.937
No. I'm not
a professional pastry chef.

1468
01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:41.938
That's okay.

1469
01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.340
No. the future
of our restaurant

1470
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.210
cannot hinge on something
I do as a hobby!

1471
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.812
Isn't that how Marco
got started cooking?

1472
01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.281
For his friends.
in his free time. just for fun?

1473
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.384
You can do that. too.

1474
01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.052
No.

1475
01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.120
Elizabeth...

1476
01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.423
...can I talk to you for a sec?

1477
01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.659
-Sure. Yeah.
-Okay. Come on.

1478
01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.464
What if...

1479
01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.932
this is actually
what you're meant to do?

1480
01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:14.237
It's so clear to me

1481
01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.406
that everything's
been leading to this.

1482
01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.409
You can do this.

1483
01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:20.743
Come on.

1484
01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:22.278
[exhales anxiously]

1485
01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:25.081
It's gonna be fine.

1486
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.922
Sofia. what are you
still doing up?

1487
01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:34.257
It's so late.

1488
01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:35.992
I was working on the menu board
for tomorrow.

1489
01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.794
[gasps] Aw.

1490
01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.962
That is beautiful.

1491
01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.331
He's changing a lot at Cibo.
isn't he?

1492
01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:47.303
Well. I think in a good way.
but yes.

1493
01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.805
Does that make you upset?

1494
01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.907
Because you know
that none of this means

1495
01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:52.775
that we're forgetting
about your dad. right?

1496
01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:54.410
I'm not upset. Mom.

1497
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.412
I'm happy.

1498
01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.481
And Dad would've loved
how happy this makes you.

1499
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:04.187
Well. you know what
really makes me happy

1500
01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:09.125
is seeing what an amazing person
you are turning out to be.

1501
01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:14.397
And your dad
would be so proud of you.

1502
01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.237
[♪♪]

1503
01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.740
Now go to bed!

1504
01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.088
Glad to see you
coming into your own. Tony.

1505
01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.858
Well. someone has to beat you
one of these days.

1506
01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.292
So. what are you making?

1507
01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.094
Grilled Bay Shrimp
with some Cajun-glazed jam...

1508
01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.496
Are you sure about this?

1509
01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.498
Positive.

1510
01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.832
Hey.

1511
01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:52.101
Deep breath.

1512
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.436
You got everything you need.

1513
01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:57.006
Okay?

1514
01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:02.044
Well. folks.
it is going to be hard

1515
01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:04.480
to top yesterday's
four entries. but...

1516
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.350
these four teams
are going to try!

1517
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.318
You have two hours

1518
01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.554
to complete your entrees
and desserts.

1519
01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:13.222
and present it to our judges.

1520
01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:15.091
And please join me

1521
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.994
in welcoming this year's
very special guest judge.

1522
01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:20.229
Carmen Costa!

1523
01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:22.298
[applauding]

1524
01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.501
[Carmen] Thank you!

1525
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.903
Thank you!

1526
01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.504
Okay. I'm way more nervous now.

1527
01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.174
I'm not.

1528
01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.075
Okay. maybe a little.

1529
01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.145
Thank you for
making the dessert. Elizabeth.

1530
01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.880
It really means a lot to me.

1531
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.649
I'm honored.

1532
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.484
Let's go win this thing.

1533
01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:42.552
For Marco.

1534
01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:43.653
[deep breath]

1535
01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.488
And for ourselves.

1536
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.025
All right. it's time!

1537
01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:50.259
Let's begin!

1538
01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.962
[♪♪]

1539
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.055
Uh. problem!

1540
01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.323
What's wrong?

1541
01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.190
The burner's not working.

1542
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.191
What?

1543
01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.626
What's going on?

1544
01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:24.961
-The burner's not working!
-Okay. okay. All right.

1545
01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.462
Well. can we--
can we fix it?

1546
01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:28.164
These things
are kind of finicky.

1547
01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:30.199
-You gotta take 'em all apart.
-Well. we don't have time!

1548
01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.334
I still need
to finish the sauce.

1549
01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:33.436
[Ben] Yeah. I know.

1550
01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:35.938
Hang tight. Stay here.

1551
01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:37.340
Here. let me look at it.

1552
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.142
Hi. Chef.
My name is Ben.

1553
01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:43.045
Okay! Grab the sauce.
Let's go over.

1554
01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.947
-Switch places?
-Yeah. Go ahead.

1555
01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.148
It's all yours.

1556
01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.250
I can't thank you enough.

1557
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.985
-Yeah.
-Thank you so much.

1558
01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.152
We're already done
and your friend explained

1559
01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:51.387
what's at stake--
we're happy to help.

1560
01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.289
Thank you. Thank you.

1561
01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:54.624
Okay...

1562
01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.393
Okay. Almost there.
Good luck.

1563
01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:59.161
-Okay. I'm gonna go finish.
-Sure.

1564
01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.565
[♪♪]

1565
01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.635
Ready?

1566
01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.536
Andiamo.

1567
01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.307
[♪♪]

1568
01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.578
This looks wonderful.

1569
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.280
-Grazie.
-Thank you.

1570
01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:22.385
[♪♪]

1571
01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:23.653
This looks amazing.

1572
01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:24.687
Did you try...

1573
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:28.991
Would you like to try

1574
01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:29.759
Chef Antonio's
Seared Scallops...

1575
01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.193
Here you are. sir.

1576
01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.162
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

1577
01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:40.169
Who's that?

1578
01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.737
My friend from school.

1579
01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.006
We've been working on
a graphic novel during lunch.

1580
01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:46.242
I'm gonna bring her a piece
of your torta. Be right back.

1581
01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.276
Sure!

1582
01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.145
Oh...

1583
01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.447
all this time. I thought she was
just hiding from her problems

1584
01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.115
in the art room.

1585
01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:55.584
Turns out she was just finding
where she really belongs.

1586
01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:59.221
Yeah. I think
that's going around.

1587
01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.592
Cheers. Enjoy. my friend.

1588
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.364
This has been
the most competitive year

1589
01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.333
we have seen in a long time.

1590
01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.767
but we can only crown

1591
01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.469
one winning restaurant's
culinary team.

1592
01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.440
For the eighth year in a row.

1593
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.674
the grand prize

1594
01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:21.043
goes to Chef Hill

1595
01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.678

[crowd applauding]

1597
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.252
[♪♪]

1598
01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:35.791
It's my fault.
I'm so sorry.

1599
01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.693
-It wasn't good enough.
-No. No.

1600
01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:41.230
Antonio.
your dish was perfection.

1601
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:44.333
It's just my dessert.
it wasn't up to par.

1602
01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.402
Oh. yours was great.

1603
01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.304
We did the best we could.

1604
01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:51.073
Your dish

Coming from you.

a restaurant for her to come to.

Since Richard is also
not in the picture.

1733
01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.405
you'll need to reassure
the bank that. going forward.

1734
01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:26.075
you'll be able to maintain
all this on your own.
