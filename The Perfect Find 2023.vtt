that were rightfully mine

161
00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:27.458

-Right?

165
00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:39.625

your subscription model failed to launch

166

167
00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:46.375

advertising model is unsustainable.

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:52.458
But we work from home when we're sick.

351
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:54.833
-Okay?
-Yes. Yes. I feel great.

352
00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.208
Okay. Um…

353
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.458
[speaking Spanish]

354
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:00.375
Right.

355
00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:01.791
[Darcy] There you are!

356
00:16:02.666 --> 00:16:05.250
-[laughing]
-[Darcy speaking Spanish]

357
00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:06.166
Come.

358
00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:10.958
Hey. um. Jenna. I'd like to introduce you
to our new videographer.

359
00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:14.208
Although. he prefers to refer to it
as filmmaking.

360
00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:15.750
[chuckles]

361
00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:17.041
It's my son.

362
00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:20.625
-Eric.
-Your what?

363
00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:25.125
Yeah. Look. I don't want you to think
there's some company nepotism going on.

364
00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:29.041
He graduated
with his master's degree from USC.

365
00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:32.125
Who has a master's? Who?
Who has master's? Is it you?

366
00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:34.625
-It's me. yeah. Yeah.
-[indistinct baby talk]

367
00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:38.375
-So nice.
-And a very vigorous vetting process.

368
00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:40.958
I'm also exceptionally talented. so…
[chuckles]

369
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:42.583
I'm sure you are.

370
00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:44.958
Yeah. there's nothing wrong
with Black nepotism. so…

371
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:48.208
Right? Right? That's what I'm saying.

372
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:53.291
Well. Eric is going to help you create
content for our subscriptions relaunch.

373
00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:54.708
So I want you to think original.

374
00:16:54.791 --> 00:16:59.708
I want you to think fresh.
sassy. exclusive. all right?

375
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:03.125
Content is king. and as you like to say.

376
00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:05.166
"Community is queen."

377
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.416
Hmm.

378
00:17:06.916 --> 00:17:08.750
-We got it. Mom.
-[mumbles]

379
00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:10.083
No "Mom."

380
00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:13.416
Nada de "Mom." Aquí. Darcy. Okay?

381
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.500
Darcy. at work.

382
00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:16.791
We got it. Darcy.

383
00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:18.250
All right. Well. you two got it.

384
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.000
I'll welcome him. Take good care of him.
[chuckles]

385
00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:23.708
I love you so much.
You're such a good boy.

386
00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:26.000
-Thank you.
-Okay. go on. Don't fuck this up.

387
00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:27.083
[chuckles]

388
00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:28.541
[Darcy] All right. vámonos.

389
00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:30.708
[Darcy speaking Spanish]

390
00:17:32.791 --> 00:17:33.833
[sighs]

391
00:17:34.458 --> 00:17:35.333
Hmm.

392
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.750
You gotta admit.
You gotta admit it's funny.

393
00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:41.833
-This isn't funny!
-[laughs] I mean. it's kind of hilarious.

394
00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:44.166
-Mm-mm.
-I mean. it is funny. right?

395
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.333
-No. No. it's not.
-You still love me?

396
00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:50.541
I'll have you know
that I barely remember anything

397
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:52.083
that happened between us last night.

398
00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:54.333
Hmm. Cool. so why you trippin'?

399
00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:59.083
Because your mom.
your mommy. she's my boss.

400
00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:00.291
You think I'm gonna tell her?

401
00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:02.791
I don't know what the fuck
you're gonna do! I don't know you!

402
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:06.958
Okay. yo. take a breath. all right?
We were drunk. We made out at a party.

403
00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:10.458
The world will continue to turn.
Everything's good. It's cool.

404
00:18:10.541 --> 00:18:12.250
You're enjoying this. aren't you?

405
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:15.500
Mm. I can't lie.
I'm happy to see you again.

406
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.750
No. No. no.

407
00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:20.416
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

408
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.000
That… That… That thing you're doing.

409
00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:25.875
don't do that.
This is my career! You have to stop!

410
00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:29.041
I'm just here to keep my head down
so I can get the hell out of here.

411
00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:31.000
So you ain't gotta worry about me. okay?

412
00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:34.166
I read about this. about your generation.

413
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.833
You guys are spoiled
and ungrateful and entitled.

414
00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.291
Yeah. okay. I know what this is.

415
00:18:39.375 --> 00:18:42.375
And I read about 40-plus-year-old
professional. single. Black women

416
00:18:42.458 --> 00:18:45.541
being bitter and mean.
but I always thought it was a stereotype.

417
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.166
-No. those are Tyler Perry movies.
-You'd fit in perfectly.

418
00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:51.833
Have a good one. ma'am. [laughs]

419
00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:57.458
Eric got him some vintage pussy.

420
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:58.875
-Some throwback!
-[both laugh]

421
00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.583
Some AARP pussy. Yeah.

422
00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:02.458
You know she got some skills.

423
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:05.750
She probably got all kinds of new tricks.
She 'bout to school you. boy!

424
00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:09.833
Nah. I don't care though. She fine.
That's all I gotta say. She is fine.

425
00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:12.500
-Yo. don't shit where you eat.
-Uh-huh.

426
00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:16.166
Like me? I don't fuck niggas at the club.
You see me fucking niggas at the club?

427
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.916
What? You met Tim at the club.

428
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.375
-But we ain't fucked till we got home.
-Exactly.

429
00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:23.208
That's why I love you so much.
Come here. Classy.

430
00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:25.041
-[laughing]
-Yeah. all right.

431
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.166
[horns honking]

432
00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:33.125
Yo. yo!

433
00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:36.166
"Yo"?

434
00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:39.083
Is that what passes
for a greeting these days?

435
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.583
-Hello. How may I help you?
-Eric. I don't wanna fight with you.

436
00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:44.500
-Okay?
-And I don't wanna fight with you.

437
00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:47.125
Grab your things. We have to be
at Greta Blumen's in 20 minutes.

438
00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:49.000
and it's all the way across town.

439
00:19:56.708 --> 00:20:00.166
So you know Greta Blumen
doesn't have a YouTube. Instagram. nada.

440
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.875
Of course she doesn't.
It's part of the allure. She's private.

441
00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:08.416
Yeah. Well. this is gonna be a wreck.

442
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.583
Says the guy who probably rode
his skateboard to work.

443
00:20:12.666 --> 00:20:15.208
What's the make and model
of the broom you rode in on today?

444
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:26.791
Okay.

445
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:28.875
[orchestral music plays]

446
00:20:35.416 --> 00:20:38.958
Hey. Yes. just stand right here.
Let's get a drop before she comes out.

447
00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:39.958
Okay.

448
00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:42.625
-[Eric] All right.
-I look all right?

449
00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:45.125
-Yeah. yeah. yeah. you look good.
-[Jenna] Okay.

450
00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:46.041
Okay.

451
00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:47.958
-[camera beeps]
-And rolling.

452
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.583
Hi. I'm Jenna Jones.
the new creative director for Darzine.

453
00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.666
-Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Cut. Cut.
-[camera beeps]

454
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.916
-Whose voice is that?
-Mine.

455
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.416
You sound like Candace Owens.

456
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:01.000
I don't sound like Candace Owens.

457
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:04.916
Five. four. three. two. one.

458
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.416
Yo. yo. yo. what's up?
It's your girl. Jenna Jones. here.

459
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.541
Darzine magazine. That's what's up.
What? What?

460
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:13.083
-What?
-[woman] Jenna!

461
00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:14.041
[Jenna] Hi!

462
00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:16.250
Oh. Jenna. my love.

463
00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:18.916
-Darling.
-What happened?

464
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.041
I was chasing Taraji P. Henson.

465
00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:24.083
and I slipped on my meditation marbles.

466
00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:26.666
Yeah. I'm… I'm sorry.
You were chasing Taraji?

467
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.666
Yes. Taraji P. Henson.

468
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:31.500
My peacock.

469
00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.916
She's one bad bitch.

470
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.541
but sadly. she perished in the fall.

471
00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:41.208
-Right.
-Come on. Come. Come. This way.

472
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:43.458
I have the perfect spot. [groans]

473
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:44.708
[sobbing]

474
00:21:44.791 --> 00:21:45.625
Maybe…

475
00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:49.541
We'll do it here. Right here.

476
00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:54.833
Next to my poor. beautiful baby. Taraji.
[sobs]

477
00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:56.666
Oh. I miss you.

478
00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:00.583
Well. this is it.

479
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:04.250
Let's… Let's get started. shall we?

480
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.958
Can you tell us a little bit
about your design process?

481
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:10.333
[sobs]

482
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:12.125
I miss you.

483
00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:14.958
I'm so sorry!

484
00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:19.208
Okay. yeah. Um…

485
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:21.625
Your new collection.

486
00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:25.250
-We'd love to hear about it.
-[sobs]

487
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.333
Taraji!

488
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.666
How was I supposed to know
her damn pet peacock died?

489
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.500
I thought it would be epic.

490
00:22:37.583 --> 00:22:40.125
Oh. nah. it was epic. It was an epic fail.

491
00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:43.583
-Why didn't you stop me?
-Are you serious?

492
00:22:43.666 --> 00:22:44.500
Yeah.

493
00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:48.208
As if you consulted me at any point
during this entire process.

494
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:50.166
This was your struggle idea. Own it.

495
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.541
It's my fault. okay?

496
00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:53.208
It's all my fault.

497
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:57.041
My whole life is riding on this job.
and I keep fucking it up.

498
00:22:58.416 --> 00:22:59.250
[sighs]

499
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:03.625
Jenna. believe it or not.
I know what I'm doing. all right?

500
00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:07.708
Why won't you just let me
help you. collaborate? It'd be easier.

501
00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:11.000
Okay.

502
00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:12.875
[phone chimes]

503
00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:19.291
You can answer that.

504
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:21.208
I'm good.

505
00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:24.000
Is that your girlfriend?

506
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.208
Ex-girlfriend. Very recent ex.

507
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.708
No. Oh my God.

508
00:23:31.791 --> 00:23:34.375
Tell me you didn't break up
because of what happened between us.

509
00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:36.833
Oh God. please.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

510
00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:41.208
-Oh my God. Are you kidding?
-Yo. Hey. someone let me out this cab.

511
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:43.541
-What?
-No. I mean. if I caused harm…

512
00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:46.791
Like. I am not that girl.
I'm a girl's girl. Had I known…

513
00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:49.583
Yo. your ego is crazy.

514
00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:52.458
First of all. nothing happened between us.

515
00:23:52.541 --> 00:23:54.625
Well. nah. something happened.

516
00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:58.041
That was. like. level one.
That was mild. Come on. now.

517
00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:00.708
Mild! That was. at least. medium sauce.

518
00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:04.166
Second. she and I were already broken up.
so you're good.

519
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.291
"Girl's girl." Oh my goodness.

520
00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:09.000
Oh.

521
00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:10.500
It's cool.

522
00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:16.375
What's her name?
What does she do? How old is she?

523
00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:17.291
[sighs]

524
00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:20.791
Her name is Madison.
She's a ballerina. She's 22.

525
00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:22.083
Of course she is.

526
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.166
Yo. okay. what's up? What's the deal?
Like. you got a man? What's going on?

527
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.541
I'm in between relationships.

528
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.208
Mainly because men my age

529
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:32.375
want women Madison's age.

530
00:24:32.458 --> 00:24:33.916
Mm. Mm.

531
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.416
I don't know. Maybe they're not interested
in dating women who are complicated.

532
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.333
-Oh.
-[Eric] Yeah.

533
00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:40.458
So Madison's simple.

534
00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:41.708
Madison is sweet.

535
00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:46.083
So that's why you broke up.
You got bored of your sweet. simple girl.

536
00:24:46.166 --> 00:24:48.125
-That's not what I said.
-That's what you meant.

537
00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:50.916
You know. this whole bitter
and jaded thing you got going on.

538
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.375
it's a really bad look on you.

539
00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:55.708
It's like some bad energy happening
all right here. Yeah.

540
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:57.958
Okay. got it. Got it.

541
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:02.583
-You know. I can't… I can't stand you.
-[chuckles]

542
00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:05.666
-[Jenna] Oh my God!
-Yeah. The feeling is incredibly mutual.

543
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.458
-Oh. you're gonna go?
-Yeah. I'm out.

544
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:09.791
-Yeah.
-All right.

545
00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.875
[horns honking]

546
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:20.416
[Jenna] There's something about that guy.
He drives me crazy.

547
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.041
And he just knows how to irk me.

548
00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:25.958
Well. he's Darcy Hale's son.
He's probably half demon.

549
00:25:26.041 --> 00:25:29.958
I can't even… I can't even trip off at him
because I don't feel like myself now.

550
00:25:30.041 --> 00:25:31.916
I don't… I don't feel like I have it.

551
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
I feel rusty. I'm struggling.

552
00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:37.041
I've researched
and pitched out this whole concept.

553
00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:41.083
And now I'm like. "Can I even deliver?"
I don't feel like I can.

554
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:43.291
Of course you can.

555
00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:48.291
Everybody has imposter syndrome.
but you just gotta dig deep.

556
00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:50.500
Find what excites you. Jenna.
You got this.

557
00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:53.458
-Problem is he excites me.
-There's that.

558
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:56.125
-That's the problem.
-You gotta find what else excites ya.

559
00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:58.750
-Yeah. what else?
-Excites you more.

00:26:19.708 --> 00:26:21.583

Well. I'd have to get a date

00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:11.666
-Okay. sold.

"Until then. coffee on me."

593
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:41.125
Brian. Asshole.

594

Wanna talk about it?

595
00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:48.625
Absolutely not.
but I did wanna speak with you.

596
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:49.708
About?

597
00:27:51.041 --> 00:27:55.458
Yeah. I want to apologize
for upsetting you last Friday.

598
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:56.875
I'm not upset.

599
00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:58.791
-You were upset.
-Nah. I'm good.

600
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:01.916
I just think maybe we shouldn't
talk about our personal lives at work.

601
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.416
Agreed.

602
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.291
Uh. and I would appreciate it

603
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:11.291
if you would stop making references
to me… being old and bitter.

604
00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:13.041
Nah. Nah. I hear you.

605
00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:16.958
Um. I mean. you kind of started it with
the whole being spoiled. being a brat.

606
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.500
talking 'bout my generation.
that whole spiel.

607
00:28:19.583 --> 00:28:22.500
It's kind of corny. but…
Yeah. yep. No. I hear you.

608
00:28:23.208 --> 00:28:24.250
So…

609
00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:27.416
-Truce?
-Truce.

610
00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:31.083
Hey. the other day in the cab. um.

611
00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:35.208

612
00:28:35.291 --> 00:28:36.416
Yeah. 'cause it is.

613
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.916
This is super lame… Lame!

614
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.250
…but I Googled you.

615
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:43.625
and you're kind of a big deal.

616
00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:46.125
You know. I don't get any of this.

617
00:28:46.208 --> 00:28:50.791
Shit. You saw that I went through
a terrible breakup. got fired from my job.

618
00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:53.750
and have been enduring

619
00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:56.416
painful. vicious memes of myself

620
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.000
for over a year.

621
00:28:58.083 --> 00:29:01.000
-That was all on the first page.
-It was my rock bottom.

622
00:29:01.625 --> 00:29:05.750
-Is that from Rock Bottom?
-No more personal questions. Okay.

623
00:29:05.833 --> 00:29:09.500
Why you got a picture of your grandma?
She kind of fine. That's all I'm sayin'.

624
00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:13.166
-[Jenna] Stop.
-[Eric] Ah.

625
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:16.958

00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:18.625
That's Nina Mae McKinney.

-Black Garbo.

629
00:29:24.791 --> 00:29:27.500
Yeah. She does kind of favor you though.

630
00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:28.500

I don't know.
I just love old Hollywood movies.

635
00:29:40.875 --> 00:29:42.250
Likewise.

636
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:45.041
It's like time traveling
to a version of humanity.

637
00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:47.250
I could have never imagined this.

638
00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:48.583
Look at you.

639
00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:53.833

00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:54.333
You know that Greta Garbo movie
when she. um. plays the seductress?

858
00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:56.208
[Eric] Flesh and the Devil. 1926.

859
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:58.625
[Jenna] You know that scene
in the church. during communion?

860
00:39:58.708 --> 00:39:59.541
[Eric] Of course.

861
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:03.458
And she takes the chalice
that he just drank from.

862
00:40:04.875 --> 00:40:06.166
and she caresses it.

863
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.083
Mmm.

864
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:12.500
And then she sucks from the same spot.
[scoffs]

865
00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:15.791
-It's profane!
-[Eric] It's profane as fuck.

866
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:16.750
It is.

867
00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:19.458
-[Jenna] But it's pure. you know?
-[Eric] Yeah.

868

I wanna love so desperately

869
00:40:22.708 --> 00:40:25.291
it's obscene.

870
00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:27.291
-You know?
-Hmm.

871
00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:31.291
I wanna love so intense

872
00:40:31.375 --> 00:40:34.583
it makes people uncomfortable
to be around us.

873
00:40:35.541 --> 00:40:37.500
-Hmm.
-That's what I want.

874
00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:41.875

Good morning.
Hey. I. um. wanted to talk to you about--

911
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.166
Eric. I'm about to save Darzine.

912
00:42:35.958 --> 00:42:37.416
Oh. do tell.

913
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.958
Yeah. so I was staring at the poster.
thinking about last night.

914
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:43.583
you know.
and our mutual love of old movies.

915
00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:47.458
-Oh. that's what you were thinking about?
-Yes. Eric. Movies.

916
00:42:48.875 --> 00:42:51.750
-Okay. Jenna. what hit you?
-Nostalgia. Right?

917
00:42:51.833 --> 00:42:53.333
Every time I watch an old movie.

918
00:42:53.416 --> 00:42:56.625
there's always going to be one garment
that I'm like. "I would kill for that."

919
00:42:56.708 --> 00:43:00.541
Like a bathrobe
or a spectacularly tailored dress

920
00:43:00.625 --> 00:43:04.416
or a gold belt or a fur muff.
Then you're always left thinking--

921
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.333
"They don't make things
like they used to."

922
00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:08.458
But what if they did? What if they did?

923
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:11.916
Last weekend. I met a designer who makes
the most fabulously constructed items.

924
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.833
and they're all reclaimed vintage.

925
00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:16.875
Her craftsmanship is couture-level.

926
00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:19.500
-Okay. no. I like where this is going.
-Okay.

927
00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:20.625
[Eric] But we need a hook.

928
00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:24.375
You know. what's the cool factor.
the influencer. the it-girl viral goal?

929
00:43:24.458 --> 00:43:27.000
-Like. who is that?
-Right. Um…

930
00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:32.416
Remy!

931
00:43:33.791 --> 00:43:35.125
[Eric] Oh shit. That's Remy Ma.

932
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:38.458
Mama. thank you. Thank you.

933
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:40.625

You know. for obvious reasons.

998
00:46:48.958 --> 00:46:52.041
I think we should just leave it behind us.

Why?

1000
00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.041
Do I have to spell it out for you?
Five letters. Starts with a D.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.583
Come on. now. My mom doesn't run us.

1002
00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:06.125
Like. honestly.
we can start our own thing.

1003
00:47:06.208 --> 00:47:09.625
We could take over this whole film
and fashion scene. These are our ideas.

1004
00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:11.541
Yes. they may be our ideas.

1005
00:47:11.625 --> 00:47:15.833
but they will go nowhere without
a real. legit company to put them into.

1006
00:47:17.583 --> 00:47:21.833
Look. your mom may be a raving narcissist.
but it has put her at the top of the game.

1007
00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:25.333

I'd hear you defend her.

-No. I'm not defending her.
-Wow.

is now attached to hers.

And what future is that?

1011
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.500
A future of respect

1012
00:47:38.041 --> 00:47:41.208
and making a name for myself

1013
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:45.375
and having more than four walls
to come home to. That future.

And I think you do too.

1019
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:06.208

when positive action
leads to positive results.

I never heard you talk about your dad.

1064
00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:07.125
Yeah. um. he. uh… He died. so…

1065
00:50:08.833 --> 00:50:09.833
I'm sorry.

1066
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:14.458
Yeah. nah. Nah.
He was killed when I was two.

Well. I mean. of course.
I don't remember much.

1070
00:50:24.333 --> 00:50:26.208
but he was. uh…
He was mixed up in some mess.

1071
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:27.666
He was in the streets. so…

1072
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.791
That must've been hard
for you and your mom.

1073
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:36.541

She isn't exactly an open book about it.

1074
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:40.291
You know. I caught her crying once.

1075
00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:42.000
but then. like. never again.

1076
00:50:42.083 --> 00:50:43.791
And I don't wanna upset her.

1077
00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:46.958
so it's really just been about me
trying to piece things together.

1078

1079
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:49.916

you know. my dad.

But. you know. I don't know. I mean…

1084
00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:05.500
Maybe she's just missing
that parenting chip. you know?

1085
00:51:06.958 --> 00:51:08.208
I probably am too.

doing a film about my pops.

About his life. though. not his death.

and. you know. his life. Yeah.

1104

Well. we met in college.
We were both crazy overachievers.

1105
00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:09.333
And we were dating and…

1106
00:52:09.416 --> 00:52:12.291
It was so good and great.

Clearly. working so closely
with a powerful woman

1256

1707
01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:26.708
So. listen.
I can come out there and help you.

1708
01:24:26.791 --> 01:24:28.625
You're gonna need help. honey.

1709
01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:30.833
Oh. I'd like that. Mom. Thanks.

1710
01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.208
Have you heard from the father?

1711
01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:37.875
No. Not since I told him. no.

1712
01:24:38.416 --> 01:24:41.625
You know. I'm just gonna give him space.
I kind of caught him off guard.

1713
01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:44.333
Sweetheart. don't make excuses
for that man. okay?

1714
01:24:44.416 --> 01:24:47.250
-Yeah.
-It takes two to tango. right?

1715
01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.541
-You didn't do this by yourself.
-Mom. don't go there.

1716
01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:51.083
You didn't get yourself pregnant.

1717
01:24:51.166 --> 01:24:53.541
-[doorbell rings]
-That might be the pillow that I sent you.

1718
01:24:53.625 --> 01:24:54.750
Oh. okay. Hold on.

1719
01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:57.458
I had to sleep on a full-body pillow
when I was having you.

1720
01:24:57.541 --> 01:24:59.875
Only time I could get
any kind of shut-eye.

1721
01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:02.958
because you just rocked and rolled
in my damn stomach.

1722
01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:06.416
All night long. it was like. "Oh Lord!"

1725
01:25:18.333 --> 01:25:19.458
Good morning. Jenna.

1726
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.541
Sorry to drop in on you like this.

1727
01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:26.500
but drastic circumstances
call for drastic measures.

1728
01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:30.625
[Jenna's mom] I sat on a washing machine
to try to get you going into labor.

1729
01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:33.208
Uh. it's not the pillow. Mom.
Can I call you back?

1730
01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:35.125
Okay. Love you.

1731
01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:36.708
Okay. bye.

1732
01:25:40.916 --> 01:25:42.291
Darcy. what do you want?

1733
01:25:42.916 --> 01:25:46.750
You've really outdone yourself. Jenna.
Making me a grandmother.

1734
01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:49.708
Can't say that I was thinking
about you in that moment. but…

1735
01:25:49.791 --> 01:25:51.541
There's a profile…

1736
01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:55.750
for women who self-sabotage.

1737
01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:59.375
Yeah. I… I think there's also
a profile on maternal narcissists.

1738
01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.750
but who's counting?

1739
01:26:01.375 --> 01:26:02.208
Hmm. Nose job?

1740
01:26:03.708 --> 01:26:08.291
Do you plan to live here?
Raise my grandchild in this?

1741
01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:11.166
-Can we just stop? Can we just stop?
-Okay. Fine.

1742
01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.041
I'm not playing
this game with you anymore.

1743
01:26:13.125 --> 01:26:14.000
Fine.

1744
01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:18.916
This… This documentary
that Eric is filming. was that you?

1745
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.291
No. This is something
he wants to do for himself.

1746
01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:26.125
-It's his story. He has a right to know.
-Yeah. and I have a right not to tell him.

1747
01:26:29.458 --> 01:26:30.333
Maybe.

1748
01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:35.958
Maybe now that you're a mother.
you might understand.

1749
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:37.666
Maybe I will.

1750
01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:40.875
You know.
I was in a very different position

1751
01:26:42.125 --> 01:26:43.916
than you are when I had Eric.

1752
01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:47.166
Ooh. my parents hated his father.

1753
01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.875
Everything about him.

1754
01:26:50.666 --> 01:26:53.166
Hated the crowd he ran with.
Thought I was…

1755
01:26:55.333 --> 01:26:56.208
too young.

1756
01:26:57.208 --> 01:26:58.250
which I was.

1757
01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:01.458
Oh. but I loved that man.

1758
01:27:03.833 --> 01:27:05.291
And I wanted our son.

Oh. and Eric was the most beautiful baby.

1762
01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:26.583
And when his father was killed…

1763
01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:32.208
my parents didn't come to the funeral.

1764
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:40.791
So it's… it's just been
the two of us ever since.

1765
01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:46.916
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

1766

Made me stronger.

1767
01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:57.375
My fierceness as a mother
became my fierceness professionally.

1768
01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:00.666
because I had him to fight for.

1769
01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:03.208
I had a son to raise.

1770
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:05.291

but your trajectory is impressive.

1774
01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:20.083
But I won't do to you
what my parents did to me.

1775
01:28:23.583 --> 01:28:27.333
That cycle ends here… with me.

1776
01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:32.000

1783
01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:54.750
[Eric] Take a guess.

1784
01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:57.666
Oh. and it's a boy.
You're carrying in your ass.

[Eric] You know I'm not ready for this.

1789
01:29:06.333 --> 01:29:09.250
I'm young. yeah. but my mom
was way younger when she had me.
