00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280
<i>When we all started at school.</i>
<i>they would laugh at us.</i>

4
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.640
They would say. "Why do you sit at home
and talk while you play games?

5
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.720
That's so weird."

6
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.560
<i>And to now where you say.</i>
<i>"I'm a YouTuber. I'm making videos."</i>

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.040
people go. "Ah! That's so cool."

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.920
<i>If you told me ten years ago.</i>
<i>we're gonna be here.</i>

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<i>I would've laughed.</i>

10
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.040
Ten years ago. I was just this kid
in my bedroom with a dream thinking.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.760
"Oh. it'd be cool
to just make a few videos online

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.240
and see where it gets me."

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.920
Hey. guys. Ah. and…

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.320
… welcome to The Sidemen Channel.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.640
The Sidemen are a group of YouTubers
that are just smashing it right now.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
The Sidemen pioneered the idea
of a YouTube group.

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.000
I don't think there's anyone
doing it bigger or better than them.

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.200
<i>They get 300 million plus views</i>
<i>every single month.</i>

19
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.920
<i>They get over a billion impressions</i>
<i>every month.</i>

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.960
244 million followers. and that is huge.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.600
<i>It goes to show</i>
<i>how powerful a group can be.</i>

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.600
The feds are gonna lock us up.

23
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.480
-They're gonna lock us up.
-We're totally getting arrested.

24
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.720
<i>You can't plan relatability.</i>

25
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.480
It's a group of friends
organically having fun on camera.

26
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.080
Here we go!

27
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.680
<i>Something that you can't fake.</i>

28
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.000
You have this group of seven young men.
They all have such distinct personalities.

29
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.880
<i>When they all come together.</i>
<i>it's just this amazing magic.</i>

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.120
Say it again!

31
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.840
<i>We had experts come along</i>

32
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.760
<i>and the one resounding thing</i>
<i>that they always say is.</i>

33
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.640
<i>"Everything we do shouldn't work."</i>

34
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.280
It shouldn't work. but it does.

35
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.480
The highest earning video is $587.000.

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.360
It makes sense. It is on 92 million views.

37
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.160
-Shout for KSI.
-Making way for the Sidemen.

38
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.920
<i>The fact that KSI has blown up</i>
<i>is really helpful for the Sidemen.</i>

39
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.520
Thank you for having me.

40
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280
-Ultimately. it's a great marketing tool.
-KSI!

41
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.640
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>want mainstream acceptance.</i>

42
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.560
<i>and they want acceptance by Hollywood.</i>

43
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.120
<i>But who the hell cares?</i>

44
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.840
<i>If you're a YouTuber getting</i>
<i>20-30 million views a video.</i>

45
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.520
you're getting more views than. you know.
the last ten movies to come out to buy.

46
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.080
Who cares what Hollywood thinks?

47
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.200
Yo.

48
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.920
For fuck's sake.

49
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.600
Everyone recognises that people
are watching channels on YouTube.

50
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680
They're not watching
the TV screens any more.

51
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.320
<i>Behaviour changed</i>
<i>because technology changed</i>

52
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.000
and kids are the first ones who adapt.

53
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.560
Do you think that the Sidemen Sundays
would be as popular if they were on TV?

54
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.680
-No.
-No.

55
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.840
TV's dead.

56
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.280
An online creator is able to give you

57
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.040
as much or as little of themselves
as they want. and it's not filtered.

58
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.440
And that is a level of engagement
that hasn't ever existed before.

59
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.480
I've been running myself into the ground

60
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.360
till like 4:00 or 5:00.
and like I do not feel okay.

61
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.800
What the Sidemen have is so much lore.

62
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.800
<i>We've got ten years' worth of experiences.</i>
<i>emotional ups and downs.</i>

63
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.240
where they're falling out
or not getting on as well.

64
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.240
…but I'm going home.
I'd rather get in the cab and fuck off.

65
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.080
Or the dynamics in the group are shifting.

66
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.280
I am no longer with the Sidemen.

67
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.760
But again. it's still content.

68
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.160
Bro. what is this?

69
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.680
It's a bit mad with fans.

70
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.200
like there's places we can't go.

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.200
We've kind of been swarmed
and locked in a little bit.

72
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.080
They're gonna hate me for saying this.

73
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
but it's like the One Direction
of YouTube.

74
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.680
Yes. You might watch my videos.
but no. you're not invited to my house.

75
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.480
We had some kids run in
and kind of interrupt us mid-filming.

76
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.880
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how much more mental it can get</i>

77
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.760
<i>and I don't wanna find out.</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

78
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.480
We're dancing. bro. Jeez.

79
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.000
-How you doing. man?
-I'm good man. Good to be back.

80
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.560
-What you been up to since the…
-What have I been up to?

81
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.840
Bro. I've been. erm. well.
I went Seychelles for a little bit.

82
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.560
Er. about nine days. That was quite nice.

83
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.600
And now. I'm out here at Sidemen.

84
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.360
and. er. we've got a crazy shoot
<i>Takeshi's Castle</i> style shoot.

85
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.240
-Mmm-hmm.
-And. er.

86
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.880
I've seen a few of the sets.
It looks mental.

87
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.040
All right. Oh. my God. Oh. my God. bro.

88
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.160
Look at this set.
It looks so much better in person.

89
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.720
Bro. our production.
We keep going up. bro.

90
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.640
Come on.

91
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.800
-Brother. how you doing?
-Welcome on set.

92
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.520
You have lost a little bit of weight.

93
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.440
-Yeah. Can I play in the charity match?
-No.

94
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.440
No. no. but…

95
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.480
-Like…
-Being strong.

96
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.880
-I've been trying.
-Fair play.

97
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.200
-Thanks. man.
-Jeez. This looks incredible.

98
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.160
Yeah. I know.

99
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.400
It looks sick. This looks very sick.

100
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.440
Lovely stuff. mate.

101
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.440
This isn't green.
This is a bit bougie. innit.

102
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.360
Yeah.

103
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.920
We levelled up a little bit.

104
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.120
Me. Vik. and Tobe are together on
this one. They're collaborative efforts.

105
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.400
It's our most expensive
and largest video ever.

106
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.960
Not too bad. Looks pretty good.

107
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.960
I disagree with what he's saying.

108
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.160
Oh. Nice to meet you.

109
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.080
Nice to meet you. too.
What are we filming for?

110
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.440
-Er. this is our doc. right?
-Oh. really?

111
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.840
<i>We've always had our eye</i>
<i>on</i> Takeshi's Castle <i>for the longest time.</i>

112
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.760
<i>We grew up watching it as a game show.</i>

113
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.480
<i>and this was the most fun thing</i>
<i>that we could land on</i>

114
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.200
<i>that would kind of mesh</i>
<i>what MrBeast does and what Sidemen is.</i>

115
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.240
<i>So hopefully. it all works out. erm…</i>

116
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.800
Well. thanks for the life story. Vik.
I appreciate that.

117
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.000
We're making…
We're making a long-form video. Harry.

118
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.600
-My honest opinion.
-Go on.

119
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.120
I wouldn't have chosen this one.

120
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000
Fair.

121
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.360
Well. it was a balance between

122
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.360
what can we build without it
costing another hundred grand.

123
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.320
and what will be entertaining to watch.

124
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.400
To be fair. this actually cost a lot.
This floor cost like 50 grand.

125
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.160
What? What? This?

126
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.800
-It's all printed. like…
-It's a mat.

127
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.960
No. hang on a minute.
I could've print this for half the price.

128
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.920
Twenty grand.
He would've hand-drawn it.

129
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.280
You can do that next time.

130
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.600
Oh. I bloody well will.

131
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.760
-Okay. Something like that.
-For 50 grand?

132
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.400
-Forgive me if I'm wrong.
-Fifty grand?

133
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.680
-I can see the seams.
-TP.

134
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.240
It's not even lined up.

135
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.120
Okay. guys. all cameras rolling. please.

136
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.280
Three. two. one. go.

137
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.440
Awesome. Yes. now.

138
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.400
-Is this. er…
-Round two.

139
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.840
We're doing… We're doing… Sorry.

140
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.360
No. It's all right. It's all right.

141
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.240
-I just wanted to cut him off.
-What was your question?

142
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.320
I was gonna ask is this how it goes
or is the flow better for you guys?

143
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.960
Oh. no. No. this is… This is always…

144
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.360
-It's always fucking…
-Okay. good.

145
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.480
It's always a shit-show.
No. No. mate.

146
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.400
Go Sidemen.

147
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.400
<i>When we started Sidemen Sundays.</i>

148
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.600
<i>they were pretty much always in our house.</i>

149
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.760
<i>and there may have not even been</i>
<i>a cameraman.</i>

150
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.480
<i>Now we have productions</i>
<i>with tons of staff on.</i>

151
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.000
<i>have whole sets being built.</i>

152
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.520
<i>There's green rooms.</i>
<i>There's catering.</i>

153
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.160
<i>There's all sorts going on.</i>

154
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.920
-Ooh!
-Oh!

155
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.360
There's a big hole.

156
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.800
So now it feels like
it's a fully-fledged production

157
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.080
where before it was kids with cameras.

158
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.960
Tobi. eight. Take two.

159
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.520
See that's so surreal.

160
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.280
I used to fake that as a kid. like.
emulate what I see on TV

161
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.880
and now it's happening. Fuck.

162
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.280
Mum. I made it.

163
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.920
<i>The core Sidemen members</i>
<i>is me and Tobi who went to school together</i>

164
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.800
<i>and then you have JJ and Simon</i>
<i>who went to school together.</i>

165
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.480
<i>Me and JJ were friends through YouTube.</i>

166
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.560
Funnily enough.
I was beating KSI at one point.

167
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.000
I've got something different.

168
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.040
We're doing a set-up video
for the first time ever.

169
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.960
<i>Josh was one of the first</i>
<i>OG YouTubers.</i>

170
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.800
<i>He was getting crazy views.</i>
<i>and. yeah. he was seen as that guy.</i>

171
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.360
<i>He was the person I looked up to.</i>

172
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.440
I was like. "Whoa.
it's Josh. like Zerkaa HD."

173
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.400
<i>Hey. what?</i>
<i>Why's he taking that down? No.</i>

174
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.440
-Help.
-No. No.

175
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.000
<i>Me and Josh</i>
<i>used to play FIFA together.</i>

176
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.600
<i>He was. like. top 200 in the world.</i>

177
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.440
<i>The numbers were astronomical</i>
<i>for that time.</i>

178
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.440
100.000 people watching your stuff.
It was mind-blowing.

179
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.440
<i>I heard of YouTube so late.</i>
<i>and it was because of JJ.</i>

180
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.440
Word kind of got around
that he was posting videos.

181
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.480
but no one could really believe it.

182
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.440
'cause at school he was. you know.
this very quiet. shy. reserved guy.

183
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520
<i>Then you'd go on YouTube…</i>

184
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.480
<i>He's there going</i>

185
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.200
It was just surreal to see.

186
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.600
Grade Five. motherfucker.

187
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.600
<i>I met Simon through school.</i>

188
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.320
In Year 7. we hated each other.
We would always be fighting.

189
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.600
Then for some reason. in Year 8 onwards
we just were cool.

190
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.680
<i>We forgot about everything.</i>
<i>and we were bless.</i>

191
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.640
<i>Ethan comes into that story.</i>
<i>this was. like. 2012</i>

192
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.320
<i>and on my birthday</i>
<i>I was watching Twitch streams.</i>

193
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.480
<i>and he was streaming FIFA and enjoying it.</i>

194
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.920
<i>You could tell like.</i>
<i>"Oh. he's. like. a London lad."</i>

195
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.560
<i>It was good vibes. good fun. He's fun.</i>

196
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.080
<i>I got on with well very quickly.</i>

197
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.520
There's a lot of. like.
common interests we had.

198
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.520
People didn't care about
how many goals we scored in FIFA.

199
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.560
they cared about the commentary
and the fun and the jokes.

200
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.520
<i>♪ I'm playing FIFA ♪</i>

201
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.560
<i>One night.</i>
<i>something's wrong with YouTube.</i>

202
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.600
<i>and when things go wrong.</i>
<i>me and Vik would talk.</i>

203
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.480
But at the time. I was
in another Skype call with the other boys.

204
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.520
And we were chatting about it.
and Vik was chatting to me. personally.

205
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.520
So I was like.
"Oh. Vik. just come in the call."

206
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.560
It's bizarre when you think
you can pinpoint individual sentences

207
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.760
that changed the course
of the next ten years of all of our lives.

208
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.480
<i>Harry joined the Sidemen</i>
<i>because he was blowing up crazily.</i>

209
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.200
Ah.

210
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.000
<i>He was a superstar before the Sidemen.</i>

211
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.720
<i>He was the young FIFA guy</i>
<i>that made his own comment.</i>

212
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:31.760
Oh. my fucking… What the fuck! I am done!

213
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.880
Oh. shit! Oh. that's properly fucked.

214
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.600
My unique selling point
was that I was really bad at the game.

215
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.560
but I enjoyed
the whole video-making process.

216
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.560
He came and he stuck and. erm.

217
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.560
he's like. sort of.
forever been under the wing.

218
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.640
<i>At the end of the day.</i>
<i>we were just friends.</i>

219
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.360
People ended up connecting with us
'cause of our connection on screens.

220
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.160
It's quite cute. really.

221
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.120
<i>The first Sidemen house</i>
<i>is a fun one.</i>

222
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.560
<i>It's just of me. Simon. Vik and JJ.</i>

223
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.520
And from the get-go the attitude was.

224
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.520
"We're here. We're working.
We're going for it."

225
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.080
Kitchen! Fridge!

226
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.840
-Zebra in a box.
-Hello.

227
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.080
The first Sidemen house was known by many
as the factory.

228
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.200
And believe me. that was…

229
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.400
that was an assembly line of content
all hours of the day.

230
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.240
<i>We'd eat dinner. film. finish filming.</i>

231
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.480
<i>go downstairs.</i>
<i>film something else in the kitchen.</i>

232
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.640
<i>wake up. edit. edit. edit.</i>

233
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.080
<i>And then go back into that same routine</i>
<i>every day.</i>

234
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.760
These guys are sitting in every day
playing video games.

235
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.760
I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.

236
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.640
Like these guys continuously working.

237
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.640
And. yeah. I… Look. I don't think
it is healthy to work as much as they did.

238
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.280
<i>These guys are confined in their rooms.</i>
<i>sitting. playing video games non-stop.</i>

239
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.800
But you could argue
like that was the difference maker

240
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.840
between them being where they are now
and… and maybe a different outcome.

241
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.320
<i>You boys have no life!</i>
<i>You don't do anything!</i>

242
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.440
<i>You sit in your bedrooms</i>
<i>all day. getting old!</i>

243
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.960
<i>Your… your lives withering away!</i>

244
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.840
<i>What are you doing with your…</i>
<i>go do something!</i>

245
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.400
<i>Why? Why? You can't just stare at a screen</i>
<i>till you're 60?</i>

246
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.960
<i>Live! Experience the life!</i>
<i>Visit a country. Do something.</i>

247
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.520
<i>I can't.</i>

248
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.000
<i>Do anything. bro. Go on a hike.</i>

249
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.600
<i>At the start.</i>
<i>I didn't see it as a job.</i>

250
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.600
<i>I was. literally. posting every day</i>
<i>because I wanted to.</i>

251
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.640
<i>I'm literally living with my best mates.</i>
<i>and everything I'm doing is fun.</i>

252
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.600
<i>So why not just do that all the time?</i>

253
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.160
Best episode is definitely the one with.
er. the--

254
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.000
What the fuck? For fuck's sake.

255
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.840
Do what?

256
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.320
Oh. shit. Oh. Ah. Ah.

257
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.480
It was relentless. It didn't stop.
But everything was paying off so well

258
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.120
and the space was. compared to now.
it was so unsaturated.

259
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.280
<i>that the more content we could make.</i>
<i>the more views we were gonna get.</i>

260
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.240
<i>There was no level of quality</i>

261
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.000
<i>that had hit the platform</i>
<i>in the same way that it has now.</i>

262
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.040
So. for us. it was a win-win-win.

263
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.320
<i>It was fascinating</i>
<i>to be part of YouTube early on</i>

264
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.960
and seeing those talented young people
creating the future back then.

265
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.480
And many people didn't understand.
including myself.

266
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.800
It was unique.

267
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.920
<i>It's seldom you have that feeling.</i>

268
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.600
<i>When something is created</i>
<i>that is beyond those people creating it.</i>

269
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.440
they didn't even understand
what they were creating.

270
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.840
<i>The main difference</i>
<i>between YouTube</i>

271
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.280
<i>and the traditional media companies.</i>

272
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.000
it's an issue of control and gatekeeping.

273
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.760
So the broadcasters would always.
in the past.

274
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.600
<i>have been the people who would decide</i>
<i>who's on TV.</i>

275
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.640
<i>what they're doing on TV.</i>

276
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.240
<i>YouTube completely turned that</i>
<i>on its head.</i>

277
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.560
It effectively said. there's no barriers
for you to get your content out there.

278
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.480
You can do what you like.

279
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.160
<i>There's not gonna be a producer</i>
<i>or a commissioner</i>

280
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.360
<i>telling you exactly how to do that.</i>

281
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.120
That's where things have been interesting
over the last 15 years.

282
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.440
<i>It was like a perfect storm really</i>

283
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.040
<i>because every success you was having</i>
<i>was new.</i>

284
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.680
<i>It was exciting.</i>
<i>and you was on the treadmill.</i>

285
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.600
But when you're on it. it's so natural.

286
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.200
You could be on the fastest setting.

287
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.240
and you're going.
and nothing can stop you.

288
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000
You're just going. going. going.

289
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.880
<i>The Zerkaa name</i>
<i>holds a lot of weight.</i>

290
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.320
<i>If we're taking about Sidemen stuff.</i>

291
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.960
I wanna hear what Josh thinks about it

292
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.120
'cause I just feel like he's a very
tuned-in guy about that kind of stuff.

293
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.560
He's also just a nice guy.
He's a friendly guy.

294
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.800
<i>Josh has been the same</i>
<i>for as long as I've known him.</i>

295
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.480
<i>Very fun. but at the same time</i>
<i>very calculated and smart</i>

296
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.160
<i>and he thinks about everything</i>
<i>that he does.</i>

297
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.960
One thing that nobody knows about you.

298
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.360
-Oh. One thing.
-Nobody though?

299
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.680
Nobody. You're revealing a secret
to the world

300
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.760
-for the first time. exclusive…
-We know.

301
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.840
Premiere.

302
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.960
Things you don't know about me.
Erm. ah. I suffer from crippling anxiety.

303
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.560
I… sometimes have panic attacks
in the shower 'cause of fear of death.

304
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.720
<i>My anxiety.</i>
<i>it's a mixture of things.</i>

305
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.720
<i>It makes me very hyper-aware</i>
<i>of everything.</i>

306
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.760
<i>I'm very calculated in what I do.</i>

307
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.720
<i>But that doesn't come because I want to.</i>
<i>It comes 'cause of how I think.</i>

308
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.400
It works for me.

309
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.280
but. obviously. it's not an ideal thing
to be doing I guess.

310
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.240
It's weird though. right?

311
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.040
Like. it's a weird discussion
'cause obviously like.

312
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.400
"Should I feel bad about that?
Is it a good thing?"

313
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.120
I… I'm very anxious.
so it made me very good at work.

314
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.520
<i>The way that I've always dealt with things</i>
<i>is… was through gaming.</i>

315
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.200
<i>It's like a whole world</i>
<i>you can go and escape in.</i>

316
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.319
And the greatest example that I use
is the reason why I'm here today

317
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.400
is because. when I was younger.
my parents got divorced

318
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.520
<i>and when there was arguments going on</i>
<i>or stuff going on.</i>

319
00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.880
<i>sat in my room.</i>
<i>played</i> Call of Duty <i>all night</i>

320
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.720
<i>which led me to go down the path</i>
<i>of playing</i> Call of Duty <i>competitively.</i>

321
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.280
<i>which then led me to be a YouTuber</i>
<i>which is where I am today.</i>

322
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.160
So. in the weirdest way possible.

323
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.920
those arguments and my parents
breaking up.

324
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.920
was one of the best things that happened.

325
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.080
-<i>It's mental.</i>
-<i>It is insane. innit.</i>

326
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.480
-Actually insane.
-Got a little inside theatre.

327
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.040
Bro's got a cinema in his house.

328
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.400
-This the master bedroom?
-Yes.

329
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.960
So if you want tonight. er.
press the button. put the shades down.

330
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.920
<i>It's actually scary.</i>
<i>I know everywhere here way too well.</i>

331
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.280
You've picked the locations
'cause of GTA?

332
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.240
Yeah.

333
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.680
Do you know how sad it is
that I know GTA road names off by heart?

334
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.080
-That's pretty--
-Like the whole city. It's fucked up.

335
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.160
I tried to catch the spares.
so I don't catch nothing.

336
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.480
-Harry. anything?
-I'm ready to have a great day.

337
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.000
All right. guys. gather up.

338
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.320
Maybe. just saying.
we just get the shot and then

339
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.640
we'll just cheat it in the edit.
so it looks like at the same time.

340
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.600
-Ready?
-All right. Let's get it.

341
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.480
Welcome to LA. boys.

342
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.040
<i>This time. we're in America.</i>

343
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.320
<i>Basically. we're trying to get</i>
<i>that MrBeast American audience.</i>

344
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.040
<i>I feel like we've had everything but that.</i>

345
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.720
<i>We've definitely conquered the UK.</i>
<i>We've smashed it in Europe.</i>

346
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.440
<i>We. kind of. just need</i>
<i>that American audience</i>

347
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.680
<i>and this is a great way to do it.</i>
<i>us being out here.</i>

348
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.360
<i>showing. you know.</i>
<i>the love that we have for America</i>

349
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.720
<i>and also making good videos out here.</i>

350
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.040
I'm excited. man. I feel like
this is gonna take us to the next level.

351
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.280
It's finally here.

352
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.880
Okay can you… bro.

353
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.640
-You don't know what we're doing.
-What do you mean?

354
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.440
Like we don't know what we're…
what this is?

355
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.880
Oh. what you do?
Walk up. say your name. your age.

356
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.600
Ten shakes. ten guys.

357
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.720
-Do we have to make up the lines?
-Yeah.

358
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.240
-I've gotta get to work. bro.
-Why'd you have to work?

359
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.520
-I…
-What do you mean?

360
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.000
I don't have any lines. dude.

361
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.800
<i>The US trip was something.</i>
<i>We filmed like three videos out there.</i>

362
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.440
Er. I'm KSI. 29 and. er…

363
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.200
Okay.

364
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.360
Spent something around
half a million dollars on that trip.

365
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.720
So there's a lot of money
going into these projects

366
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.440
<i>which is. in return.</i>
<i>a lot of pressure to deliver.</i>

367
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.080
It'd be in Hollywood.
It'd be near our hotel.

368
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.240
Mate. and also.
the quicker you get stuff done.

369
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.200
the less traffic there'll be coming back
from Venice Beach to Hollywood.

370
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280
All right.

371
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.720
So just make sure
they just don't go mope about…

372
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.280
Yeah. that's good.
That's good content. anyway. All right.

373
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.840
Er. I'm just tired.

374
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.520
-No one's had any sleep.
-No one's had sleep.

375
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.640
It was all a bit like chaotic and…
and crazy.

376
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.880
It's a ropey one. It's. er.
a lot of pressure on this video.

377
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.480
And you think. "Oh. yeah.
LA's a great place to film."

378
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.080
Erm. turns out it's not.

379
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.160
America is a. sort of. awkward place
to film 'cause they all know.

380
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.600
They get it. They understand filming.
so like. "Right. You guys earn money.

381
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.040
We will charge you this much. use this."

382
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.440
And it's just ridiculous rates
all the time.

383
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.360
Whatever happens. you roll
with the punches and make it work.

384
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.360
That's what we do.

385
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.960
We make stuff work
regardless of the circumstances.

386
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.160
<i>A lot of people underestimate</i>

387
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.960
<i>how hard it is to be successful</i>
<i>as a creator.</i>

388
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.520
<i>And I get really frustrated with</i>
<i>how dismissive people are of creators</i>

389
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.760
thinking. "Oh. it's easy."

390
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.200
They're in their bedroom.
and they just talk nonsense.

391
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.000
That is rubbish.

392
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:08.000
It is so hard to get cut-through.
particularly on a platform like YouTube

393
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.040
<i>where there are 600 hours uploaded</i>
<i>every minute.</i>

394
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.360
I do think it's good. How are you?
Jump in the middle.

395
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.920
Okay.

396
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.520
-Thank you. man.
-Thank you. guys. Thank you.

397
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.320
Nice to meet you guys.

398
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.640
Oh. my God.
I don't wanna make you feel old.

399
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.440
but back when I was younger. dude.
I still watch y'all today.

400
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.840
-I'm kind of shaky. so…
-Thank you very much.

401
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.920
You know. thank you. Thank you.

402
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.720
<i>Fans feel like they know us better</i>
<i>than traditional celebrities</i>

403
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.960
<i>'cause they are seeing us as us.</i>

404
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.120
<i>When you see a footballer.</i>
<i>you see them kick a ball.</i>

405
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.440
<i>You don't see any personality.</i>

406
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.560
<i>When you see an actor.</i>
<i>they're being someone else.</i>

407
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640
<i>When it's us. you're literally seeing…</i>

408
00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.760
you know. you're seeing Tobi be Tobi.
That's it.

409
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.040
-How are you? Feeling good?
-Good.

410
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.480
Good man. Good chilling.

411
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.080
-Yeah. Can I get a picture?
-Of course you can. brother.

412
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.360
-Bet you didn't expect to see me.
-Yeah. Nope!

413
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.800
Honest… Honestly no.

414
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.640
-You filming YouTube?
-Yeah. bro. We're doing a road trip.

415
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.280
-I'm in the middle of the desert. bro…
-And someone's clicked you.

416
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.800
That's so crazy. man.

417
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.480
You lot are crazy.
I fucking love you lot so much. man.

418
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.360
They're running to me.
This is not safe.

419
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.600
Ah.

420
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.080
Hello. everyone.

421
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.000
Our first event as the Sidemen Insomnia
was a real eye-opener.

422
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.960
It legitimised what we did.

423
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:56.040
It turned those numbers and those comments
into real faces. real people.

424
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.720
<i>It really started to make us understand</i>
<i>the power of the Sidemen brand.</i>

425
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.320
more so than we did up until that point.

426
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.000
The one. the only the Sidemen.
Sidemen. everyone. Whoo!

427
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.200
That was the first time. I think.
we realised that it was like a big deal.

428
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.720
<i>Felt really weird</i>
<i>'cause we do everything online</i>

429
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.880
<i>and then you go to this place</i>
<i>and you're meeting these people.</i>

430
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.480
<i>It was really weird.</i>

431
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.120
<i>And back then. that was mental.</i>

432
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.040
<i>They ran a merch stall</i>
<i>at Insomnia. and they ran it as cash only.</i>

433
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.560
This is… this is how humble
their background was. right?

434
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.920
They literally had printed some t-shirts
and hoodies. took them to this event

435
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.080
<i>and Josh said he had a rucksack</i>
<i>with £100.000 in cash.</i>

436
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.880
<i>It was at that moment. for me.</i>
<i>I was… you know. brought to my attention</i>

437
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.080
<i>how powerful these guys are</i>
<i>in that community.</i>

438
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.240
All right. That's the end of Insomnia!

439
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.720
Yeah. Thank you. guys.

440
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.240
That's a wrap.

441
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.800
<i>In the early days.</i>

442
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.920
monetisation made it possible
to create this industry.

443
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.520
I was a broke-ass uni student. right?
I was living off of Subway points.

444
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.800
I promise you. like my Subway card
was the most valuable thing in my wallet.

445
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.880
When I'm seeing that the stuff
that I'm doing on YouTube

446
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.400
has the potential to get me some money

447
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.400
that I can use to pay off these expenses
that I have while I'm studying.

448
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.000
I'm like. "Okay. cool.
That is a motivating factor."

449
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.600
It was like. "Hang on a second.

450
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.000
The more I can crank
this number of views up.

451
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.960
the more money I get in my bank
at the end of the month.

452
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.280
The more validation this has.

453
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.800
the more cool things
that I can buy and do."

454
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.640
You uploaded these videos
on a weekly basis.

455
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.240
and you got more and more audience.

456
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.520
and suddenly. the algorithm recognise you

457
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.600
and you start making money on advertising
that YouTube was selling.

458
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.760
And the big ones were making millions.

459
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.320
<i>I got a bloody Lambo</i>
<i>when I was like 18</i>

460
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.280
<i>'cause I was making decent money</i>
<i>back then.</i>

461
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.680
<i>Obviously a horrendous</i>
<i>and fiscally irresponsible idea</i>

462
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.120
because the insurance itself
cost more than the car.

463
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.080
Look what I've done already.

464
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.080
<i>It was ridiculous.</i>

465
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.960
I bought a pair of shoes that was $30.000.

466
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.920
-Ah!
-Mate.

467
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.840
$35.000.

468
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.840
Ta-da.

469
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.040
<i>Bought a gold PS5.</i>

470
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.120
Looks like you're holding a baby.

471
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.040
No. I'd take way more care with this.

472
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.600
Baby ain't worth $8.000.

473
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.240
Oh. Whoa.

474
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.360
<i>Buying a Lamborghini</i>
<i>and then colouring it purple Tron</i>

475
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.240
<i>even having. like.</i>
<i>Need For Speed LED lights underneath.</i>

476
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.160
<i>I mean it looked cool as fuck</i>
<i>but the amount of attention that I got…</i>

477
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.080
was incredible.

478
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.040
When I was younger. I'd always be like.
"I need this amount of money."

479
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.760
And when I've got this amount of money.
I can just stop doing YouTube

480
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.040
and just live my life and travel and…

481
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.560
because that's really what I wanna do.
I wanna have fun and do stuff.

482
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.920
<i>But then I realised.</i>
<i>I should really be saving</i>

483
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.280
<i>in case I've got like a family</i>
<i>in the future.</i>

484
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.920
<i>And I wanna like put my money</i>
<i>to a good cause</i>

485
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.240
<i>and like do like actual</i>
<i>good stuff with it.</i>

486
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.360
<i>Harry is unapologetically himself.</i>
<i>And he's just so weird.</i>

487
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.720
No. no. no. no. no. no.

488
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.920
<i>-He's so weird.</i>

489
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.440
But normal at the same time.

490
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.000
<i>People know he's outrageous.</i>

491
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.600
<i>People know he says outrageous things.</i>
<i>He's free to be that.</i>

492
00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.520
Ah.

493
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.480
Ooh.

494
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.240
<i>So what this intro was meant to be</i>

495
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.160
<i>was me hitting the bucket of drinks</i>
<i>all over my mum.</i>

496
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.160
<i>But instead…</i>

497
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.320
<i>I was really lucky</i>
<i>to grow up in Guernsey</i>

498
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.440
<i>because it's just like the perfect little</i>
<i>adventure playground for a kid.</i>

499
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.800
<i>I used to build like treehouses and stuff.</i>
<i>I used to just. I don't know. muck about.</i>

500
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.960
<i>I was bit of a weird kid</i>

501
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.840
so I didn't have a load of friends
when I was growing up there

502
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.480
but I think being the weird kid
pushed me into doing YouTube.

503
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.400
<i>As soon as YouTube was like a half-thing</i>
<i>like people were posting. I was on there.</i>

504
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.520
<i>And I know a lot of the guys</i>
<i>are OGs on YouTube.</i>

505
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.080
<i>but I promise you I wasn't far behind</i>

506
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.920
<i>because I was posting. like…</i>
<i>not even like proper videos.</i>

507
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.960
<i>Just like me editing</i>
<i>like special effects of stuff.</i>

508
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.800
Hey. guys.
This is gonna be a quick…

509
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.280
unedited vlog…

510
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.400
For Adam on your PC
for his Christmas collab video. erm.

511
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.960
pretty much all I have to say is
Merry Christmas.

512
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.000
I hope you get all the presents you want.

513
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.000
And if you don't. then shoot Santa.

514
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.200
<i>Harry Stevens</i>
<i>on camera really. He's very lovable.</i>

515
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.640
Now we're talking.

516
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.200
<i>Like a Golden retriever. like a Labrador.</i>
<i>Like that type of energy.</i>

517
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.600
<i>He's just cuddly. you know?</i>
<i>So he's a great guy.</i>

518
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.840
Very hard worker as well.

519
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.800
People think maybe…
they would think that he's. like. lazy

520
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.600
'cause he doesn't post all the time
but he's not.

521
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.280
<i>When he sets out to do something.</i>

522
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.640
<i>he does it to the best of his ability.</i>
<i>and he creates the best content.</i>

523
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.520
A hard work ethic is really the glue
that binds the seven of them together.

524
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.600
The fact that they keep doing it

525
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.160
with such a smile on their face.
loving what they do.

526
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.440
is a testament to their friendship
but also that work ethic

527
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.760
<i>which really has enabled them</i>
<i>to get to this position.</i>

528
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.000
<i>'cause not many people are here</i>
<i>after ten years.</i>

529
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.400
more relevant than ever
and growing at a pace

530
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.720
that you would assume this was
their first year. not their tenth.

531
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.640
What do you think motivates us
to keep going?

532
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.280
Legacy.

533
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.680
-I mean for me it's always legacy. but--
-Ego.

534
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.920
I think deep down we've worked so hard
to get to the top that…

535
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.960
-We don't wanna let it go.
-We can't let go now.

536
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.280
Don't wanna be washed.

537
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.240
That's the same reason
why I assume you still post videos

538
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.880
'cause you could stop tomorrow.

539
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.480
-and you would slowly like--
-He has.

540
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.480
He stopped two years ago.

541
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.600
-Sidemen.
-No. But you could stop Sidemen.

542
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.280
-You could stop Sidemen. You could chill.
-I'm down for that. That's a great plan.

543
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.360
So why don't you leave?

544
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.640
He's like. "Can't wait
for this thing to end."

545
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.240
Yeah. I think… I think I'm close.

546
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.480
I think I'm… I think I'm close.

547
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.560
We all laugh when he says it. Yeah…

548
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.160
No. I always hear the…
you can hear the truth in his voice.

549
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.520
The truth in it every time.

550
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.920
-But like what is…
-It gets stronger every time as well.

551
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.640
What keeps you going
from stopping tomorrow?

552
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.240
Because I enjoy it still.

553
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.560
I enjoy. er. I enjoy it.

554
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.400
But also I enjoy the… It's… this stuff.

555
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.880
This is like… and like the shoots…
the shoots I enjoy. it's just…

556
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.680
It's everything
where you are technically in charge.

557
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.360
I guess so. Yeah.

558
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.640
If this was to come to a vote.
you would've said no.

559
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.960
-What do you mean?
-Like this.

560
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.240
-To do this whole piece.
-You'd give a no. innit?

561
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.880
You're all lovely people. but yeah.

562
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.720
-It's not… yeah. I don't know.
-It's fair.

563
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.960
What? So what are you guys gonna…

564
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.920
What's your plan?

565
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.800
-So I see YouTube as the core. the heart.
-The foundation.

566
00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.680
-Without YouTube…everything dies.
-That's so smart. man.

567
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.200
So I wouldn't be able to box.

568
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.840
I wouldn't be able to do music
without YouTube.

569
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.320
So I always feel like
I have to post content there

570
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.280
to make sure everything else thrives.

571
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.760
KSI. KSI.

572
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.720
<i>From London. England.</i>

<i>Gonna go for six rounds.</i>
<i>KSI and Temperrr.</i>

579
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.280
<i>This right here</i>
<i>is where the fight's gonna be decided.</i>

580
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.320
<i>KSI said this week.</i>

581
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.880
<i>"I'm willing to eat those</i>
<i>to get to where I wanna get to."</i>

<i>Tommy's gotta stay on his bike.</i>

583
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.120
<i>Don't get lulled</i>
<i>into playing a trade game.</i>

584
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.280
Ooh.

585
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.240
<i>Yeah. Those shots land and they hurt.</i>

586
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.280
<i>Gotta work angles if you're Tommy.</i>
<i>He can't attack in straight lines.</i>

587
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.360
<i>KSI could step back and land a bomb.</i>

588
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.600
<i>Can he get up?</i>

589
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.600
<i>Oh. can he get up?</i>
<i>It's done!</i>

590
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.440
-It's done!
-<i>That's it!</i>

591
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.760

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.200

595

<i>and still</i>
<i>the Misfits cruiserweight champion.</i>

596
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.680
<i>KSI!</i>

597
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.720
<i>As soon as he walks out.</i>
<i>I get incredibly nervous.</i>

598
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.240
When he gets punched a little bit.

599
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.480
everyone in the Sidemen and troops
and everyone like that just goes. "No."

600
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.720
And we fear. But in my heart.
I'm just like I know he wins.

601
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.680
Stop boxing. We have videos to make. JJ.

602
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.520
Fuck.

603
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.480
We've got videos to make.

604
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.480
and you're doing camp for six weeks
at a time. Fuck.

605
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.400
<i>Life was interesting</i>
<i>with me and my family.</i>

606
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.440
<i>You know we weren't super rich.</i>

607
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.080
Both my parents were. I guess. immigrants.

608
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.760
<i>They came over from Nigeria</i>

609
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.200
<i>and just put a lot of work</i>
<i>into me and my bro.</i>

610
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.400
Get out.

611
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.120
Hey. guys. Olajide BT.

612
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.080
and today I'm doing a Q&A Sunday
with my bro. Say "hi."

613
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.760
You're such an idiot.

614
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.600
My earliest memory of Deji
was when he…

615
00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.880
he couldn't…
couldn't hold his piss

616
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.320
<i>and my mum gave him a bottle.</i>

617
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.000
<i>So he tried peeing in a bottle</i>
<i>and his dick fell out.</i>

618
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.040
<i>and he just starting pissing all over me.</i>

619
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.520
Yeah. I was. that was an experience.

620
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.719
<i>JJ went from this super nerdy.</i>
<i>like. super shy guy</i>

621
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.639
to one of the most famous people
in the country maybe in the world.

622
00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:21.360
<i>You know boxer. rapper.</i>
<i>and also he carried the entire UK scene.</i>

623
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.480
The UK would not be like this
without JJ on YouTube for sure.

624
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.080
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

625
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.480
JJ is… he's a funny character.

626
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.719
<i>He's the most egotistical person</i>
<i>and the most humble person simultaneously.</i>

627
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.560
What's up. bro?

628
00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.400
And when that camera is on.
his character is in full flow.

629
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.520
So. everything that you know about JJ

630
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.760
is elevated probably
like five times minimum.

631
00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.840
-Oh. my God!
-Open the window.

632
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.440
No! There's a bug. bro!
Ah! Get it… get it out. bro.

633
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.960
I'm-a die. I'm-a die. I'm-a die. bro.

634
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.880
Oh. no. Get out! Ah. shit! Shit!

635
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.040
I think my parents' work ethic
is definitely a huge reason

636
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.680
why I'm so successful.

637
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.200
I'm just always grinding.

638
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.040
Like I always have said
that I'm not talented.

639
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.520
I'm just a person
that just works extremely hard.

640
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.880
There's a saying where

641
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.880
if you put 10.000 hours into something
you become a master at it.

642
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.880
And you know I've definitely
had 10.000 hours on YouTube

643
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.760
and that's why I'm in the position I'm in.

<i>as a YouTuber</i>

651
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.280
there was just no way
you could do music properly.

652
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.960
<i>People struggled to differentiate</i>

653
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.960
between a musician putting out.
you know. heartfelt music

654
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.960
and music that was important to you.

655
00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.600
and then also a YouTuber
who's able to make funny random videos.

656

658
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.880
So I was kind of battling with that aspect

659
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:21.440
and decided I wanted to become a musician
and really focus on music.

660
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.520
Er…

661
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:41.840
Obviously this is. er…
this is not an easy. er…

662
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.960
this is not an easy video to make.

663
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:50.200
I am no longer with the Sidemen.

664
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.760
I think I was just on my computer.
and it came up.

665
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.320
And then the group chat
started popping off like.

666
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.880
"What's going on. JJ?
Why. er. what is this video?

667
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.720
"Like are you serious? Are you not?"

668
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.280
<i>Obviously. I love the guys.</i>

669
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.120
Guys will always be in my heart.

670
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.160
But. er. you know.
all good things come to an end I guess.

671
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.920
JJ is a very trusting guy.

672
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.120
And I know that he had countless people
telling him to leave Sidemen.

673
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.320
"Come to LA. You can be way bigger."
Blah. blah. blah.

674
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.560
Selling him like a proper dream.

675
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.440
So it was a nervous time for all of us
in terms of would he… would he leave?

676
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.600
Why I'm leaving Sidemen? Er…

677
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.920
mainly because of Ethan.

678
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.480
I'd say he was the main reason
I'm leaving.

679
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.480
Can't stand him.

680
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.680
I could see it coming

681
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.280
because it makes sense
why he singled me out

682
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.160
because I'm an easy target
in the sense of like.

683
00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.360
I dish it out to everyone. anyway.

684
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.240
At that point that was the. the low point
in the Sidemen arc. I would say.

685
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.920
We were starting to make videos
less together.

686
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.080
JJ was taking his music more seriously.

687
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.560
And it could've been the point
everything fizzled out.

688
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.640
<i>♪ Yeah</i>
<i>Fuck the Sidemen ♪</i>

689
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.360

<i>♪ Bitch. don't fuck with me ♪</i>

694
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.520
I woke up in bed
with my girlfriend at the time. who said.

695
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.720
"Hey. have you seen
what JJ's just uploaded?"

696
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.120
So I wake up like this.

697
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.400
I'm watching it on my phone thinking.
"What on earth's happening?"

698
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.680
<i>I do have some sort of like pride</i>
<i>in myself a little bit like.</i>

699
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.360
<i>"I will do something."</i>

700
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.640
I will perform to what you want me to
if you think I'm not going to

701
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.480
'cause I bet he didn't expect me to have
a whole thing out 24 hours later.

702
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.080
And that's what I really liked about it.
him releasing that

703
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.280
because you can tell by the songs.

704
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.280
music's not my forte in the slightest.
right?

705
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.640
<i>But the fact that he might wake up</i>
<i>and go on his phone and go.</i>

706
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.360
<i>"Really? Like Ethan did that?"</i>

707
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.400
That's the… that was the W for me.

708
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.320
What the fuck is this shit?
Man. you know I've gotta react to this.

709
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.600
<i>♪ No. Ethan. stop that</i>
<i>Please stop that ♪</i>

710
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.600
<i>♪ I beg you stop that ♪</i>

Erm. no. sorry. Fuck off.

714
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.600
Never made a diss?
What the fuck is this then?

715
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.440
"Behzinga Drama.
KSI and Ricegum diss track."

716
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.440
It's like…

717
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.240
The diss track thing. My eyes lit up.
like it was a perfect opportunity.

718
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.880
Like I'd always liked doing like…

719
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.880
we used to in these Skype calls
we used to have.

720
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.920
We used to just sit there
and do rap battles.

721
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.080
So we'd sync up a beat.

722
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.680
We'd all be hearing.
and we'd just like rap at each other.

723
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.440
which I always really enjoyed.

724
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.760
As soon as I figured out
diss tracks were happening.

725
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.680
I was like.
"I could do a diss track here."

726
00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.080
It's the best diss track I've ever heard.

727
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.600
The first time I heard of the Sidemen

728
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.760
was actually Harry's diss track against JJ

729
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.640
<i>'cause we were beefing at the time.</i>

730
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.160
and Harry made the diss track.
I thought it was awesome.

731
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:50.440
When I first heard Harry's diss track.
I was pissed because he went in.

732
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.560
and I was like.
"Bro. what the fuck are you doing?"

733
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.560
<i>I was in America at the time.</i>
<i>and I was like so angry.</i>

734
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.920
So I was like. "All right. Calm. bless.
Like we're gonna go down this route."

735
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.360
And then that's when I decided
to make "Little Boy".

736
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.160
You know what. that's probably…

737
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.760
that's one of the first times JJ
actually started to shine as like raw.

738
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.200
His words and his music.
is actually hitting. you know?

739
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.160
It's hitting like…

740
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.640
Even though it was comical. it was fun.
it was just in jest.

741
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.800
it actually started to let them
shine through

742
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.960
as like. "We're making music. you know?"

743
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.680
Like. "We're dissing. saying things.

744
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.720
hitting with music.
thinking about what we do.

745
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.800
thinking about the beat.
the beat switch. the cut-outs. the video."

746
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.280
<i>If there was no diss tracks.</i>

747
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.800
<i>JJ might not have taken his music</i>
<i>as seriously as he's taking it now.</i>

748
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.320
That was a sick time. Can't be done again.

749
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.480
You know what? I was surprised
to hear Simon spit that quick.

750
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.520
He done a sick job.

751
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.440
And that video. we filmed it in. like.
an evening at some petrol station

752
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.760
and then I had the edit up
ready the next day.

753
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.480
And I remember the moment
of when he clicked the "upload" button.

754
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:39.640
And then as soon as you hit refresh to see
how many views you've got. It said 40.000.

755
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.200
I'm not kidding.
It was literally 30 seconds.

756
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.640
That's insane.

757
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.440
I think it was just a good way
that we could all have fun. get views.

758
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.160
and that's about it really. to be honest.
But then it ended up spiralling.

759
00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.840
Okay. "You're a korma. I'm a vindaloo.

760
00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.640
When you're a bad boy.
Yinka grabs the shoe."

761
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.800
"While you're out trying to fuck groupies.

762
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.560
I got your mum twerking
for my rupees."

763
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.960
<i>It's impossible to put a value</i>

764
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.520
<i>on how lucrative the diss tracks</i>
<i>ended up being</i>

765
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.240
<i>by the complete coincidence</i>
<i>that we fell into them.</i>

766
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.800
But I would say
on the diss track videos alone.

767
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.320
it was probably
half-a-million pounds' worth of revenue.

768
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.760
And then if you talk about

769
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.680
how much viewership and attention
it drove towards us.

770
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.560
several times that in the long run.

771
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.840
<i>It rallied all of these fans.</i>

772
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.040
<i>It created this huge content opportunity</i>

773
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.120
<i>that actually made the Sidemen bigger</i>
<i>than it had ever been.</i>

774
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.240
<i>Ultimately. I'm still in the Sidemen</i>
<i>because they're my boys.</i>

775
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.320
Yeah I know it's hard work making.
you know. my dreams come true

776
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.360
<i>as well as doing stuff with the Sidemen</i>
<i>and making our dreams together come true</i>

777
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.960
<i>but it's what I'm willing to do</i>
<i>to make sure me and them are good.</i>

778
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.280
Yeah. Just 'cause they're my boys. man.

779
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.720
<i>With the cheap</i>
<i>versus expensive videos.</i>

780
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.120
<i>it becomes very personal</i>

781
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.400
<i>'cause it's very hard to see past the fact</i>
<i>that one team are having a great time…</i>

782
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.960
Oh. this is my holiday.

783
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.560
<i>They've got lots of cool experiences.</i>

784
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.760
Oh. yes.

785
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.160
<i>And you're stuck on the bad team.</i>

786
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.680
Have we got some bug spray?

787
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.400
-That bag.
-I want it. Where is it?

788
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.560
Behind the scenes with the boys.
it turns into like. "What the hell?"

789
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.360
So literally we've been given
a camping spot

790
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.560
that is just riddled with…
with literally stinging nettle.

791
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.800
<i>The audience don't wanna see</i>
<i>the bad team have a great time.</i>

792
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.280
They wanna see the bad team suffer
'cause the suffering is the content.

793
00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.000
I've more than accepted fate.
We are in a fucking shithole.

794
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.320
We are camping on rock.

795
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.520
We have a rock formation
in our fucking tent.

796
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.720
Can we do a hostile takeover
of the other campsite?

797
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.440
Are you eating already?

798
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.400
Fuck off. I'm in my happy space.

799
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.000
I'm eating a sausage in a forest.

800
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.600
Okay. So we've returned to.
now. the bad team.

801
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.600
Now to get abused and attacked
for making them be on the bad team.

802
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.000
Er. piss off.

803
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.160
-Is he here?
-Yeah. he is here.

804
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.200
Piss off. you fucking big head.

805
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.360
God. what a spot.

806
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.120
Does he want us to reply to him?

807
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.920
Oh. no. You don't look very happy.
This is the worst one you've ever done.

808
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.080
-Why?
-It's awful.

809
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.000
Sit down.

810
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.920
-I got a present for you.
-No. no. Take a seat.

811
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.960
-Oh. it's like a council.
-Yeah. Take a seat.

812
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.040
-Welcome to. er--
-Hang on. two secs.

813
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.240
-Welcome to Team Tent.
-Team Tent? Nice.

814
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.720
Team Tent up in this bitch.

815
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.520
<i>I actually went and visited</i>
<i>the. er. bad team</i>

816
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.840
and their moods were not…
in the greatest of ways.

817
00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.640
-Sack these ones off.
-What the fuck is this game?

818
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.200
Ethan as well 'cause at that time.

819
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.640
Ethan hadn't really experienced
being on a good team

820
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.680
<i>so I feel like it's. er.</i>

821
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.920
<i>bottled up frustration had occurred</i>
<i>from being on the bad team.</i>

822
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.560
What does the new card say. er. this is…

823
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.440
"Congratulations you've come out on top
from bad to good. Get ready to swap."

824
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:24.920
Oh.

825
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.480
So you're happy now. yeah?

826
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.840
Go nuts. bro.

827
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.040
We've been eating dog food. bro.
We've been through the worst of it.

828
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.840
Listen. I'm trying to work
with you.

829
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.400
-But I'll…
-One of you come.

830
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.600
We've done the worst.
What's the point in swapping?

831
00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.960
-Tobi. go.
-Why are you…

832
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.360
How are you… how are you upset
about getting a good deal?

833
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.800
No. 'cause it's pointless.

834
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.240
They come here and do everything?

835
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.360
-One person.
-I don't care.

836
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.480
-Bro. just go. Ethan. just go.
-I ain't going.

837
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.440
No. Me and Behz aren't going.

838
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.200
-Vik… No.
-We're in this life. Tobi. go. Tobi. go.

839
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.000
No. This is good.

840
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.080
'Cause look. look. look. you. look get…

841
00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.600
They ain't eating the dog food.
They gonna come… listen. I'll get vexed.

842
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.320
They're gonna come here.
They ain't been eating the dog food. bro.

843
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.640
-Just work with him.
-You. go.

844
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.120
-Me and Behz can't go.
-Why is this so hard?

845
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.480
We've done it already!

846
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.240
-What's the point in swapping?
-'Cause you get… a great night.

847
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.520
We get a great night. but I'm going home!
I'd rather get in the cab and fuck off!

848
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.280
I'm so glad I've seen this footage.
This is amazing.

849
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.280
Yeah. it's funny.
That was my hot-headedness.

850
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.160
-It's fine it got 30 million views.
-You've done well. mate.

851
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.120
Oh. damn.

852
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.800
That's the only one. I think.
I've ever had with you ever.

853
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.480
-What like argument that--
-Yeah. yeah. Like proper argument.

854
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.080
No. no. Let's be honest.
We've fallen out a few times.

855
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.080
-I feel like you're always involved.
-Not always.

856
00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.360
Even if he's not involved.
he gets involved. He loves it.

857
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.760
-We didn't even know.
-I did. I…

858
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.400
It would involve you. me. or you.

859
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.600
Yeah. yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

860
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.080
It's us three. Little trifecta.

861
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.200
Harry. have you ever--

862
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.320
No. But I love
watching it from the outside.

863
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.120
I love a little bit of that.

864
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.560
He's… he's like a pot stirrer.

865
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.080
He's like a pot stirrer. I'm like…
I try and be like… I try and help guys.

866
00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.120
Just like a counsellor.

867
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.920
I try and explain and it doesn't work.
Vik does the same. Tobi does the same.

868
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.760
He just sits there and goes. "Ooh."

869
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.680
We're seven very different personalities
but somehow it all just works naturally.

870
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.720
"Your nose looks like
it's on a snapchat filter 24/7."

871
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.760
"Hey. Slender.
how comes you have cum in your hair?"

872
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.280
The interesting part
of being on social media

873
00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:42.040
is that you have an ability to be able
to see and respond very quickly.

874
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:48.040
But with that. trolling and mental health
has become a real topic of conversation.

875
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.960
"What is the difference
between Vikkstar and a tree?

876
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.480
"Nothing. They're both hollow
on the inside and brown on the outside."

877
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.600
<i>Instant feedback</i>
<i>can be really toxic.</i>

878
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.560
<i>It can be very. very detrimental.</i>

879
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.520
especially when you consider the age
of a lot of these creators.

880
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.880
Well. this one's just foul.
He's like the at and the…

881
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.040
the at might as well be a tweet itself.

882
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.240
Behzinga. a fat cunt. says…

883
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.480
See? I'm done already.

884
00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.560
Oh… @behzinga.

885
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.960
"You are so fat it's embarr-is-ing.

886
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.880
I laughed so much when I heard
that you cried every day after school

887
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.240
because you were bullied.

888
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.800
just because you are so ugly and fat.
Ha. ha. ha."

889
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:52.960
<i>It's 4:50 in the morning.</i>
<i>So. yeah. it's been a long day.</i>

890
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.840
From my lighting. I look okay.
but I don't know. now I look like shit.

891
00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.480
I look like utter shit.

892
00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.080
<i>Ethan got</i>
<i>a lot of negative comments.</i>

893
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.400
<i>People online find your weakness</i>
<i>and pounce on that.</i>

894
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.080
So I imagine it would've been really hard.

895
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.920
You could get 368 comments. right?

896
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.400
<i>Seven of those will be horrific.</i>
<i>hateful comments</i>

897
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.880
<i>but the other 300-odd are really nice.</i>

898
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.160
<i>but your brain completely blanks them</i>

899
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.080
<i>'cause you pay attention to the seven</i>
<i>that are ripping you down.</i>

900
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.400
<i>I wouldn't say I was aware</i>

901
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.160
<i>that Ethan was depressed about his weight</i>
<i>back in 2018.</i>

902
00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.840
<i>But I feel like there was some more signs</i>
<i>that he wasn't the happiest.</i>

903
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.080
Oh. no. Oh. no.

904
00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.200
When you're happy with yourself.
making three videos a day is a breeze

905
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.280
because you're doing something you love
and think.

906
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.320
"Yeah. cool.
I can't wait to click upload."

907
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.480
<i>When you're not happy within yourself.</i>

908
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.800
<i>it's almost like people expect</i>
<i>three videos a day.</i>

909
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.320
<i>I don't feel good enough</i>
<i>to post three videos a day.</i>

910
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.240
<i>and it's only so long</i>
<i>you can burn that end of it</i>

911
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.440
<i>before it bites you</i>
<i>and that's where I think I…</i>

912
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.000
<i>I got to a point where</i>
<i>I just wasn't happy at all.</i>

913
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.040
<i>When Ethan was at his lowest.</i>
<i>he kept everything to himself a lot.</i>

914
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.000
<i>So I wish he'd spoken to us</i>

915
00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.760
'cause we could've helped
in any way we could.

916
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.360
In my head. like I feel like

917
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.520
I should've picked up
on things a little bit earlier

918
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.360
but. at the same time.
I was out a lot. drinking loads.

919
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.200
<i>so that was pretty normal for me.</i>

920
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.880
<i>He was drinking a lot</i>
<i>but wasn't really going out as much.</i>

921
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.360
<i>so he would just stay at home</i>
<i>and drink while playing video games.</i>

922
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.720
It definitely got to a point
where like look we…

923
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.720
we've gone through a whole bottle of JD
in one night.

924
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.480
Like that was probably where
I started raising eyebrows.

925
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.960
<i>Bottles of Jack Daniels</i>
<i>were going quickly.</i>

926
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.640
<i>I think like 250 quids' worth of weed</i>
<i>a week. That's nuts.</i>

927
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.760
I said. "Listen it's fine.
Like. I'm okay. I'm in control of it."

928
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.720
Bollocks.
I wasn't in control of it at all.

929
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.920
I'm exhausted and… and the expectation
is getting the better of me. I think.

930
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.040
I think it's just getting
the better of me.

931
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.960
I've been running myself into the ground

932
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.120
till like 4:00 or 5:00.
half past 5:00 in the morning

933
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.640
and like. "I do not feel okay."

934
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.760
<i>I knew I was a burden.</i>
<i>like a shit person to be around.</i>

935
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.200
<i>So it was tough. mentally.</i>

936
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:46.280
<i>I've had like the thoughts of like.</i>
<i>"Oh. this is shit.</i>

937
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.960
<i>If I whack myself off.</i>
<i>then this all ends."</i>

938
00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.040
<i>It's really dark. right.</i>

939
00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.240
<i>'cause I know there's a big bridge</i>
<i>with like concrete pillars on it.</i>

940
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.200
<i>So that was like.</i>
<i>"Oh. I know where I could do it."</i>

941
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.280
<i>And that's a horrible thought process.</i>

942
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.280
<i>It was more like. "That's it. Cool. Done."</i>

943
00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:33.880
I had a knocking at my door
at. like… literally like 3:00. 4:00 a.m.

944
00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.600
And it was Ethan's girlfriend at the time.

945
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.960
and she's telling me that he's. erm.
been drinking and he's gone out.

946
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.240
and he's taken the car.
and she doesn't know where he is.

947
00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.800
He's not answering his phone.

948
00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.240
And I'm like…
I didn't know what to do really. er. like.

949
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.520
"What do I do? Do I call the police
and tell them my friend's drink driving?"

950
00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.680
Like I'm trying to find out where he is.

951
00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.960
I was kind of just in a state of…

952
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.200
I don't know. confusion. really.

953
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.000
I mean. at that point.
you know. we're all…

954
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.720
we're all fearing for our… one of our
best friend's lives kind of thing. Erm…

955
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.080
<i>I just broke down.</i>

956
00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:23.640
<i>I just broke down and just said like.</i>
<i>"I can't do it. man. I can't do it."</i>

957
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.160
<i>It's like a relief moment like.</i>

958
00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.240
<i>the crying on my friend.</i>
<i>it's like a relief moment.</i>

959
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.280
<i>Like you can finally start getting</i>
<i>across to someone that.</i>

960
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.360
<i>"I'm so done. man. I've reached my limit.</i>
<i>I need help."</i>

961
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.640
And that's. again.
it comes with the pride thing.

962
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.280
You've gotta be able to drop this pride.
this act. this ego of thinking.

963
00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.480
"Oh. it'll get better. I'll be all right.
Oh. you'll be fine. I can get through it."

964
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.640
So just speak to people.
You have to do it.

965
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.160
You have to open up.
You have to speak to people.

966
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.480
Ethan's story made the friendship group
a lot stronger.

967
00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.480
erm. because we were now more aware
of things going on.

968
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.120
<i>Because before that.</i>
<i>you hear about these things.</i>

969
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.440
but you're not really tuned in.

970
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.360
You don't think it's gonna be your friends

971
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.240
that are going through this.

972
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.000
So I think that was… a big wake-up call
for everyone. honestly.

973
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.240
-Mate.
-Yes. bro.

974
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.600
Right. turn side on.

975
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.080
-This way? Back.
-Yeah.

976
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:29.760
Here we go. How big is Behzinga? 103.1 kg.

977
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.600
<i>With Ethan.</i>
<i>I was personally inspired by his journey.</i>

978
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:37.920
He went through a lot of personal growth
during that time

979
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.640
<i>and I think what's been really fundamental</i>

980
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.760
is his ability to be able
to really be raw with it.

981
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.600
Nine. eight. come on. Come on. come on.

982
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.560
Keep pushing.

983
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.720
Push. push. Don't stop.

984
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.760
Six. five. four. three. two. one.

985
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.040
Time. Well done.

986
00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.800
Not a joke.

987
00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.760
<i>To see someone pull through that.</i>

988
00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.680
<i>and what we have seen</i>
<i>in the past couple of years as well.</i>

989
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.640
is that a lot of men
don't get the support they need.

990
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.480
<i>And I think to see that</i>

991
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:13.760
<i>shows that the new generation</i>
<i>have something relatable to look at</i>

992
00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.400
and see that
if they were ever in that situation.

993
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.760
there's always a way out.

994
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.400
Well. hello. Welcome to 2019
on the Behzinga channel.

995
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.240
How are you? I hope you're. er.
gonna have a great year.

996
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.440
I messed that up with my mouth
but we're here.

997
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.720
-Let's say Ethan got big again.
-Yeah.

998
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.680
Don't worry. he is.

999
00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.880
How do you… but now… knowing
things he's gone through as well. like--

1000
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.920
Yeah. No. I… no. no. no.
I know he's gone through…

1001
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.960
He's gone through a lot of pizzas.

1002
00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.240
I can hear his mind working.

1003
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.800
You lot.

1004
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.440
I think it's like… just British culture
at the same time as well.

1005
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.520
like we're all brought up on
bringing each other down.

1006
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.400
-You tease your mates.
-Yeah. like lad humour. Is that right?

1007
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.320
That's so sad.

1008
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.680
I tell you the difference. yeah?
Straight up as the person who it is. Okay.

1009
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.320
You lot. I know at the end of the day.

1010
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.960
if someone come up to me
and said the stuff that you say…

1011
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.320
-You'd say…
-Oh. no. Don't get…

1012
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.200
-They'll get slapped.
-You say. "Who do you think you are?"

1013
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.440
So it comes down to the YouTube audience
thinking they are one of your mates.

1014
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.320
So the major problem from it
came these random people…

1015
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.240
All the time.

1016
00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.160
Anywhere. bro.
on the field playing football.

1017
00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.880
-Fat
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1018
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.120
You're thinking. "You don't even know me."

1019
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.560
But our… our humour is now…
everyone sees it.

1020
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.280
-and they think they're in on it.
-They're a part as well.

1021
00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.240
-They feel part of the group.
-In real life.

1022
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.160
I'd be anywhere. bro.
Er. or like I'd be going somewhere.

1023
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.600
"Oh. you fat. whatever."

1024
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.480
And it's like. "What do you want me to do?

1025
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.520
"I don't know you."

1026
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.640
I don't know you. yeah.

1027
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.760
-You've just met me and abused me.
-It's true. Yeah. actually.

1028
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.320
Imagine I come up to you and just went.
"You fat loser."

1029
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.360
You'd be like.
"Ah. All right. bro. Chill out."

1030
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.400
Shit. yeah.

1031
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.800
-Now as we're actual adults now…
-Yeah.

1032
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:02.200
…I think when someone is clearly not
in the space. their minds are normally in.

1033
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.560
people do even in group chats
will just say like. "Everyone good?"

1034
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.840
And it can be a one question.
but that's all it needs.

1035
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.720
To be honest. it's like maturing. I think.

1036
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:13.680
But also we grew up in a generation
where mental health wasn't talked about.

1037
00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.600
At school. you wouldn't talk about it.
You'd never have like…

1038
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.640
No. Not a chance.

1039
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.840
We've never been taught any of this stuff

1040
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.640
and then we're dealing
with millions of people watching us.

1041
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.920
How do you teach someone…

1042
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.080
You don't. You can't be online
and have really thin skin.

1043
00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.480
We learnt that quick.

1044
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.000
You've gotta realise that this is
part and parcel of broadcasting yourself.

1045
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.640
Did anyone go like therapy or anything?

1046
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.840
I've been to therapy. Yeah. yeah.

1047
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.320
When I went to therapy.
I literally just spoke.

1048
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.600
It was someone to listen.
and as I'm talking and saying how I feel.

1049
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:46.040
I'm also processing it and understanding
and then dealing with it.

1050
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.920
You find yourself
answering your questions.

1051
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.360
Basically I figured it out for myself.
Yeah. yeah.

1052
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.560
So you find benefit
from therapy. right?

1053
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.160
Yeah. No. I thought therapy
was extremely helpful.

1054
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.760
She gave me the key to open these doors
and I was like. "Oh. wow."

1055
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.760
I realised. "Oh. okay.
I now know what I want to do.

1056
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:08.200
and how to get there.
and you know. what's… best for me.

1057
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.960
And you know. er. something as simple
as saying "no."

1058
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.400
Like I've said "no" to so many things now

1059
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.440
because I'm like.
I don't have to say "yes."

1060
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.760
-I don't have to always please people.
-Mmm-hmm.

1061
00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.440
The reason why I would always say "yes"

1062
00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.640
is because in my childhood.
I'd always say "yes" to my parents.

1063
00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:23.600
Like no matter what.

1064
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.000
If I didn't wanna do it.
I have to say "yes" because I'd get beat.

1065
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.200
or something like that.

1066
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.840
So now. I literally just say "no"

1067
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.560
and I understand I need time for myself
to do things.

1068
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.520
-Prioritising myself.
-Yeah. exactly.

1069
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.240
We've all got better
at the balancing act.

1070
00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.240
I think talking about your mental health
has become a big part of online especially

1071
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.360
because people are starting to understand
that these people that you idolise

1072
00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.760
are normal people.
and they have real feelings.

1073
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.760
<i>We're here for our second physical</i>
<i>Sides location launch.</i>

1074
01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.600
<i>-First one is at BOXPARK. Wembley.</i>
-<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1075
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.080
<i>This one is Gravity Wandsworth.</i>
<i>a place I am very fond of.</i>

1076
01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.480
<i>Come here a couple of times in my own time</i>
<i>to bowl. electric go-kart.</i>

1077
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.600
But yeah. got a couple supporters
coming down to get some free food.

1078
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.120
Free food always tastes better.
by the way. Always.

1079
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.440
-How are you?
-I'm good. You?

1080
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.400
Good. good. good.

1081
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.960
<i>If you're not learning.</i>
<i>you're not living.</i>

1082
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040
It's a good one.

1083
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.880
That's a good saying. innit?
I came up with that today.

1084
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.840
-Why are you shaking your head?
-How?

1085
01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.960
I'll dash this at your head.
What's your favourite?

1086
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.200
Live like others can't. so in time.
you can live like others won't.

1087
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.480
Live like others can't.

1088
01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.920
Wrong way round.
Wrong way round. by the way.

1089
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.200
You said that way. didn't it.
or did I say it? I can't.

1090
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.680
Honestly. well. you could…
well. you could do that also.

1091
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.600
Next time. just don't be poor.
That's what you just said. bro.

1092
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.320
You said live like others can't.

1093
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.400
-Won't say it again now.
-What's your…

1094
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.800
No. It's to live like others won't.
So in time you live like others can't.

1095
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.640
You know you put in the work.
do things that people won't do.

1096
01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.680
-Eventually. hopefully. fingers crossed…
<i>-Inshallah.</i>

1097
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.880
Then you can. you know.
live life like others can't.

1098
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.400
because they didn't put the work in.
didn't do the groundwork.

1099
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.440
These waffle fries are incredible.
by the way.

1100
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.960
I'm not even chatting. Can I swear?

1101
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.200
-Wow.
-I can swear. I'm not even chatting shit.

1102
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.120
Do you want a waffle fry?

1103
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.720
No. but seriously. does anyone want any
'cause it's fucking incredible.

1104
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.040
I guess you point it out.

1105
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.400
Literally everyone's looking at us.
I get so paranoid

1106
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.320
Not surprised.

1107
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.480
Hey. it's a lot of people.

1108
01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.720
Oh. shit. It's insane in here.

1109
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.440
It's this incredible moment where
you get the real-world manifestation

1110
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.160
of those likes. those comments.
those views

1111
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.080
<i>and you realise just how powerful</i>

1112
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.720
<i>this incredible content publishing machine</i>
<i>the boys have created really is.</i>

1113
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.680
The Sidemen. they've inspired me
since I was like eight years old.

1114
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.840
I've been watching them for a long time.

1115
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.280
They're just fun to watch.

1116
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.160
They make videos on. er. different types
of topics and they're just fun.

1117

<i>They're just good.</i>

<i>the whole YouTube scene.</i>

1119
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.360

that put a smile on my face.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.800
I literally look so forward
to watching their videos like every day.

1121
01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.200
<i>Watching Sidemen videos.</i>
<i>obviously it's all banter and jokes.</i>

1122
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.400
<i>but then there's also lessons</i>
<i>that you learn.</i>

1123
01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.120
You kinda see the friendship.
the teamwork. the whole communication.

1124
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.240
They have this fun side to them.
so I wanna follow that. too.

1125
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.280
Is this… is this safe?

1126
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.920
<i>To us. we're messing around.</i>
<i>We're having fun.</i>

1127
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.080
<i>We're creating content.</i>
<i>We're doing something cool. It's cool.</i>

1128
01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.160
<i>But you also sometimes forget</i>
<i>that for someone else.</i>

1129
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.000
<i>that's their escape from reality</i>

1130
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.000
<i>or that's the thing that's gonna get them</i>
<i>through the day.</i>

1131
01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.200
<i>And that really comes to light</i>
<i>when you speak to some supporters.</i>

1132
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.320
<i>I feel like the biggest thing</i>
<i>that separates us from a lot of creators</i>

1133
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.000
is people really connect to us
as a friendship group.

1134
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.600
A lot of them say they feel like
they're the eighth member.

1135
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.480
<i>Tobi. honestly. is one of</i>
<i>the nicest people that I know in life.</i>

1136
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.480
Not just in the Sidemen.
He's one of the nicest people that I know.

1137
01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.880
In his nature. he's kind.
In his day-to-day life. he's just kind.

1138
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.840
He always thinks
of the nicest thing possible.

1139
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.280
<i>It makes me feel like</i>
<i>my parents raised me right.</i>

1140
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.080
<i>but it's also just the way I am.</i>
<i>I've always been that way.</i>

1141
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.200
<i>I don't know any kind of other way to be.</i>

1142
01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.880
<i>I have nothing but the utmost respect</i>
<i>for both my parents.</i>

1143
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.160
<i>My dad was working three jobs at a point.</i>

1144
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.440
<i>He'd go out at night.</i>

1145
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.600
<i>I wouldn't see him 'cause he'd be sleeping</i>

1146
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.520
<i>and I'd be at school and whatnot.</i>

1147
01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.960
<i>Or he'd be working another job.</i>
<i>his second job. his third job.</i>

1148
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.880
<i>I've always got a joy</i>
<i>from helping other people.</i>

1149
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.200
I love this guy.

1150
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.080
I like to see the people around me happy.
It makes me feel happy.

1151
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.920
Okay. Open your eyes. Simon.

1152
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.520
-Oh! Unreal.
-Good man.

1153
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.800
-How do you feel?
-A million likes.

1154
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.560
Hey. cut the video. man.

1155
01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.280
In the position I'm in now.

1156
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.800
to be able to help my family
when they need it

1157
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.920
or my friends when they need it
or complete strangers sometimes.

1158
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.720
it feels like I'm contributing
something to the world.

1159
01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.800
-What do we want?
-Justice!

1160
01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.040
-When do we want it?
-Now!

1161
01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.320
<i>Since the George Floyd incident.</i>

1162
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.760
<i>my mind has been going non-stop.</i>
<i>I've been struggling.</i>

1163
01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.200
You're tired of hearing
about our racist experiences?

1164
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:42.840
Imagine. imagine how tired we are
of experiencing it. Imagine.

1165
01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.920
And I'm one of the lucky ones.

1166
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.240
I'm one of the fucking…
I'm so blessed. you lot.

1167
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.560
I can't tell you
how fucking blessed I am.

1168
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:07.440
It was heartbreaking to see Tobi like that
'cause Tobi is always bubbly.

1169
01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.960
So to see him in that kind of mood
and. talking about this kind of stuff.

1170
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.560
I remember trying not to shed a tear
watching Tobi on the stream.

1171
01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.720
That might have been the moment
when he realised.

1172
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.440
"This stuff happens to me. you know.
similar. and I've never spoken about it.

1173
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.360
now the whole world's talking about it
when it's ended fatally."

1174
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.400
So. maybe. it was a good time to share.

1175
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.400
It doesn't surprise me.

1176
01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.720
Tobi will speak his mind
when he wants to speak his mind.

1177
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.360
If I tell you the amount of shit
I've been through.

1178
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.480
you wouldn't believe it.
Imagine the unlucky ones.

1179
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.960
Imagine the ones that are dying
at the hands of these…

1180
01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.880
I ain't wanna call them humans
'cause they're not human. man.

1181
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.800
They don't act human. they don't.
They fucking don't.

1182
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.760
I'm so sorry for breaking down.
I really didn't wanna break down.

1183
01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.640
I really. really tried to compose myself.
I've… I've lost my shit. man.

1184
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.320
<i>The response that I got from that</i>
<i>was amazing.</i>

1185
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.200
Yeah that's just one example of me
talking about something serious

1186
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.640
and it having an impact.

1187
01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.040
But it's in my nature
to talk about that stuff

1188
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.360
because I guess I wear my heart
on my sleeve.

1189
01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.920
<i>I'm not afraid to show my emotions</i>
<i>or how I feel about certain things.</i>

1190
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.960
<i>I share my feelings with my audience</i>
<i>'cause that's how they connect.</i>

1191
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.960
That's how they view you as a human.

1192
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.560
Oh. God. First player off the bus.
Come on.

1193
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.240
Jeez. Let's go.

1194
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.000
<i>We've actually just flown in</i>
<i>from Singapore to catch this match</i>

1195
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.520
'cause we've been Sidemen fans
for a really long time.

1196
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.840
It's pretty exciting for us.

1197
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.400
USA. New Mexico. USA.

1198
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.520
Erm. Essex. So northern Essex.

1199
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.279
Sidemen Sunday. every Sunday.
telly goes straight on to YouTube.

1200
01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:24.200
After like a stressful week.
you've got Sidemen Sunday coming.

1201
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:29.160
You can eat your takeaway. put it on.
and you'll be… escape from the world

1202
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.160
and just have a laugh.
and we always watch it every week.

1203
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.840
I've watched them for so long and like…

1204
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.279
they're just so creative in what they do
and every video's just. like. amazing.

1205
01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:43.240
I love the one where the Sidemen
became parents for 24 hours.

1206
01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.840
That's one of my favourites.

1207
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.240
Personally. I'm here to see
Miniminter and KSI but for you…

1208
01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.920
Well. for him. he's more of a Simon fan.

1209
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.600
but I'm actually here for Speed
from the YouTube Allstars.

1210
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.880
I really love Speed.

1211
01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.920
So. I'm really hoping he'll score some…
quite a few goals.

1212
01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.840
Oh!

1213
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.800
Yeah.

1214
01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.040
Oi. Speed. What are you? Striker?

1215
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.600
-Left wing.
-Left wing. cheese.

1216
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.520
-Oh. my God. Look at it. man.
-Ooh. Oh. my God.

1217
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.800
-Chris joined our side.
-Come on.

1218
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.840
-You've been getting a bit of flak.
-Yeah. It wasn't even my decision.

1219
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.319
No it was actually our decision
to bring Chris over to.

1220
01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.720
what we believe
is balancing out the teams.

1221
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.800
-If we've done that or not. who knows.
-Yeah.

1222
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.359
It's always so difficult to tell

1223
01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:36.840
'cause there's loads of people
that you've never seen play before so…

1224
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.920
-Yes. Exactly.
-You definitely rigged it for them.

1225
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.200
I've never played soccer. football.
whatever so.

1226
01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:44.840
I have no idea what I'm doing.
So. if it was even. you've just taken…

1227
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.880
Stop saying this.

1228
01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.479
Fuck KSI.

1229
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.200
-Football.
-Let's go. boys.

1230
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.360
About to bust your ass. Bust your ass.

1231
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.720
-Come on then. huh?
-Bust your ass.

1232
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.200
I don't give a shit. bro.
I don't give a shit. bro.

1233
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.360
We're about to bust their ass. man.
It's over.

1234
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.440
<i>In the match in 2022.</i>
<i>the match sold out within one evening.</i>

1235
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.400
<i>It would've sold out immediately.</i>

1236
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.640
but we broke the servers
when tickets went on sale.

1237
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.440
There was 170.000 people
trying to buy tickets.

1238
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.440
<i>It's the first charity match</i>
<i>we've done in four years.</i>

1239
01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.440
<i>It's the first event that we've had</i>
<i>as a group since before the pandemic…</i>

1240
01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.400
Let's go. boys.

1241
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.200
…where we've got to be with
such a large amount of our audience.

1242
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.200
<i>The crowd's</i>
<i>welcoming these players.</i>

1243
01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.560
<i>It's getting lively here at The Valley.</i>
<i>1.3 million people watching this.</i>

1244
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.240
<i>It's exciting.</i>

1245
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.440
<i>We might have two. three.</i>
<i>four million people watching at once.</i>

1246
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.400
<i>Oh. it's unbelievable.</i>
<i>Those numbers are simply sensational.</i>

1247
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.840
<i>Captain takes it quickly.</i>

1248
01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.680
<i>Remember he scored his goal. I think.</i>
<i>in the first two minutes.</i>

1249
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.720
<i>-</i><i>Yeah.</i>

1250
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.000
<i>They're underway.</i>
<i>This is not gonna be a nice game.</i>

1251
01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.080
<i>Speed is celebrating.</i>
<i>First blood has gone to Speed.</i>

1252
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.720
<i>It's what we're gonna see.</i>
<i>It's little battles all around the pitch.</i>

1253
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.320
<i>Chunkz can hit one here.</i>
<i>He's hit one. Pieface.</i>

1254
01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.080
<i>Goal! Oh. my word!</i>

1255
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.720
<i>Take a bow. Chunkz!</i>

1256
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.680
<i>It's still going</i>
<i>for the YouTube all stars.</i>

1257
01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.680
<i>Could be a chance for Niko Omilana!</i>
<i>It's in! It's two-nil to the Allstars!</i>

1258
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760
We'd all said all we want is goals.

1259
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.480
Even if we lost eight-five.
we just want goals.

1260
01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.360
<i>Simon! Can he get it</i>
<i>to Vik? He's through.</i>

1261
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.320
<i>Go on. Vik.</i>

1262
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.720
<i>Chance for the Sidemen!</i>

1263
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.400
<i>Everything became</i>
<i>a little bit poetic.</i>

1264
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.680
<i>We were back on track. Morale was up.</i>

1265
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.680
The stadium was happy.
and we were set for a good game.

1266
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.200
<i>-Randolph to Simon. One-two.</i>
<i>-Oh. that's gorgeous.</i>

1267
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.040
<i>-It's gotta be a goal! Oh. it is!</i>
<i>-Two-two!</i>

1268
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.320
<i>What a game!</i>
<i>It's the shot.</i>

1269
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.680
<i>Oh. my gosh.</i>

1270
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.520
Instantly. we're like. "Okay.
Well. this game is already a classic.

1271
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.720
It's already amazing."

1272
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.040
<i>Oh. will it in?</i>

1273
01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.920
<i>What a game!</i>
<i>You can't take your eyes off it!</i>

1274
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.640
<i>Now Jizzle outside the box!</i>
<i>Oh. what a ball that is. Wow. Wow.</i>

1275
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.320
<i>We could be going to penalties here.</i>
<i>Seven apiece.</i>

1276
01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.760
<i>-Hang on! Hang on! Oh. my God!</i>
<i>-</i><i>Oh. my God!</i>

1277
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.800
<i>Miniminter gets his hat trick</i>
<i>and what a way to seal it.</i>

1278
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.160
<i>But the referee is gonna</i>
<i>bring the whistle to his lips…</i>

1279
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.760
<i>-And it's all over!</i>
<i>-</i><i>It is full time. 8-7.</i>

1280
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.960
<i>One of the best games we've seen</i>
<i>on YouTube.</i>

1281
01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.760
<i>I'd love to have gone to penalties</i>

1282
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.400
<i>just for how much of a spectacle</i>
<i>that would've been.</i>

1283
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.880
<i>But at the same time. I'm not gonna</i>
<i>complain about scoring a winner</i>

1284
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.920
in front of 2.5 million people. am I?

1285
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.880
<i>It has been absolutely</i>
<i>fascinating and heartwarming</i>

1286
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.520
<i>to see how much this match</i>
<i>has been discussed</i>

1287
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.240
<i>and how much the content</i>

1288
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.760
<i>of people discussing the match.</i>
<i>has trended.</i>

1289
01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.960
<i>And even if you look</i>
<i>at the number of concurrent viewers</i>

1290
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.280
<i>they had on that match</i>

1291
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.520
<i>that probably surpasses</i>
<i>the concurrent views</i>

1292
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.080
on huge events that we have

1293
01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.720
like the Champions League final.
like the funeral of the Queen. you know?

1294
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.720
Those numbers are absolutely staggering.

1295
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.120
So far it's one million.
seventy-four thousand. three hundred and--

1296
01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.120
<i>I don't think we really understood</i>
<i>how big this one was gonna be.</i>

1297
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.640
So to be able to say. er…

1298
01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.320
we raised over a million pounds
for charity is absolutely gigantic.

1299
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.680
And that goes to really good charities.

1300
01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.360
and good to have a charity partner onboard
that is one of the group.

1301
01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.960
We're trying to organise some events
for this coming year

1302
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.640
to raise money for M7 Education.

1303
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.080
If you guys do wanna know more about M7.
I'll stop talking about it now.

1304
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.920
but I'll leave a link to it
in the description down below.

1305
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.800
and you guys can go check it out
and donate if you want to.

1306
01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.440
You're a horrible person if you don't.

1307
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.480
<i>So my brother worked at a bunch of schools</i>

1308
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.760
<i>that couldn't afford to go</i>
<i>on school trips.</i>

1309
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.000
So I'd always said to him
that I wanna start a charity.

1310
01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.080
When you get into a position where you can
do good. use it.

1311
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.800
So M7. for those that don't know.
we find schools that are in areas

1312
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.360
<i>where the students might not be able</i>
<i>to afford to go on school trips</i>

1313
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.720
<i>-and have these educational experiences.</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

1314
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.120
And it's all funded through you.

1315
01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.160
Like the whole… and as of last week.

1316
01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.200
I'm pretty certain I can say.
got charity status.

1317
01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.480
-Let's go.
-Finally. a charity…

1318
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.800
For me it was… when I went to school.
I was lucky enough to go on school trips.

1319
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.320
So I always remember those way more
than the rest of the school year.

1320
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.000
So we signed up over a thousand students
to go on school trips.

1321
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.280
-Wow.
-Which is pretty awesome.

1322
01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.600
Thank you. M7 team!

1323
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.680
Being able to give. however many kids.
the chance to go on those school trips

1324
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.480
and make their own memories is…

1325
01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.640
seemed like a no-brainer
for me and my brother.

1326
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.600
<i>The misconception</i>
<i>about Simon is that…</i>

1327
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.680
<i>he always tells me he's self-conscious</i>

1328
01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.680
<i>or he's not sure that he has something.</i>

1329
01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.600
So Josh has got like his clothing brand.
JJ's got his music.

1330
01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.120
Simon's always asking what's his?

1331
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.400
Well. his is just hard work
and consistency.

1332
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.920
<i>He like posts about six videos a day</i>
<i>on about 15 different channels.</i>

1333
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.440
He's just like relentless with it.
So every day. non-stop hard work.

1334
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.600
He never misses a day.
He never misses the content.

1335
01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.640
So he just works super. super hard.
and does deserve credit.

1336
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.400
Yo! What's going on?
Welcome to another Reddit video.

1337
01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.080
That's right. I am posting videos.

1338
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.520
Remember my favourite post or comment
will win $1.000.

1339
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.840
He's stubborn with…
his work ethic has never changed.

1340
01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.440
It's like. "We need to get this done
and that's that."

1341
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.960
<i>Like he'd run the More Sidemen channel</i>
<i>for years.</i>

1342
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.000
<i>Without him being on that channel</i>
<i>and taking responsibility.</i>

1343
01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.160
<i>I don't think it is where it is today.</i>

1344
01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.040
<i>So his stubbornness pays off for him</i>

1345
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.480
<i>because he has the right mindset</i>
<i>about things</i>

1346
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.560
<i>and when he's made his decision.</i>
<i>he's made a decision.</i>

1347
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.360
So it's not a bad stubborn Simon
when you do see this.

1348
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.920
It's a good stubborn.
You're good.

1349
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.720
I don't know how Simon does it. man.

1350
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.600
Simon's got all the money in the world.

1351
01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.560
He's got the Sidemen stuff doing well.
and he still grinds.

1352
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.520
<i>Every day he's posting.</i>
<i>like. multiple videos.</i>

1353
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.840
<i>Consistency really does matter</i>
<i>on the platform.</i>

1354
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.160
<i>And when you have these super fans.</i>

1355
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.760
<i>they have expectations</i>

1356
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.960
of when you're going to deliver
the content that they want.

1357
01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.040
And so it's an anticipation.
It's an excitement.

1358
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.360
Tanya Pile. slate five. take one.

1359
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.120
So the boys are. obviously.
the creative brains.

1360
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.320
They will come up with what videos to do.

1361
01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:36.400
and they'll chat to me about
what they would like that video to be.

1362
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.920
and then I do my best to make it happen.

1363
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.680
How's it going. guys?

1364
01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.960
And welcome to Sidemen hide and seek

1365
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.240
on a jumbo 747 plane.

1366
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.520
Hey. yo! I can't do this.
I can't.

1367
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.520
Fuckin' hell.

1368
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.440
<i>As time's gone on.</i>
<i>got bigger studios.</i>

1369
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.360
<i>bigger locations. more travel.</i>

1370
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.680
They're always wanting to be
one step ahead.

1371
01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.240
and it's really exciting. and we're always
like. "What can we do next?"

1372
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.160
I'm like. "How much bigger can we go?"

1373
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.200
Before lockdown. we had…
I don't know how many million subscribers.

1374
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.000
We've got like 17 now.
So like lockdown was huge for the Sidemen.

1375
01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:15.920
Whoo!

1376
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.920
<i>Because we was</i>
<i>that one consistent thing</i>

1377
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.400
<i>in people's lives that they could watch</i>
<i>every Sunday</i>

1378
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.200
<i>and then more Sidemen throughout the week.</i>

1379
01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.760
<i>I think probably after Covid.</i>

1380
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.360
and everyone had like two weeks inside
just watching our videos.

1381
01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.640
that's when it got a bit mad.

1382
01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.520
I don't know if you can hear me. but
my balls are squished into my trousers.

1383
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.320
I'm really proud of the growth
over the last few years.

1384
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.480
It's been phenomenal.

1385
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.360
-One. two. three!
-Sidemen!

1386
01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.760
Contrary to belief.
we actually don't really pay attention

1387
01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.240
to trends or to dates that much.

1388
01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.200
I think the. the bliss and the blessing
of Sidemen is it's long-form content

1389
01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.120
that you get to really see
an insight into us

1390
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.440
and you get the true us.

1391
01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.880
<i>If you was to focus on analytics and data</i>
<i>too much.</i>

1392
01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.520
<i>you'll get a different product.</i>

1393
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.800
You'll get a 16-minute video
which is very much in your face.

1394
01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.520
You'll get a lot of great concepts.
video and views.

1395
01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.400
but you'll lose a lot of personality.

1396
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.800
<i>So. there's not many channels like ours</i>

1397
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.600
<i>where you can get away with</i>
<i>a two-and-a-half-hour long video</i>

1398
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.160
<i>and get 90 million views.</i>

1399
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:25.080
We've had experts come along and people
who work with the likes of MrBeast.

1400
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.200
<i>The one kind of resounding thing</i>
<i>that they always say is.</i>

1401
01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.320
"Everything we do shouldn't work."

1402
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.800
And that makes me laugh. right.

1403
01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.640
'cause it's like…
"It shouldn't work but. it does."

1404
01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.400
There's been a lot of group channels
that have tried and failed.

1405
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.440
We've got systems in place
that make things that always worked.

1406
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.120
They've got these mad systems in place

1407
01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.480
that I don't think many other. er.
YouTube boy bands. er. have in place.

1408
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.360
Run!

1409
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.440
<i>If someone's like 15 minutes late</i>
<i>for a shoot.</i>

1410
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.520
<i>then that means that they're gonna get</i>
<i>a yellow card.</i>

1411
01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.000
<i>I remember at one point</i>
<i>it being a frustration for me and Simon</i>

1412
01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.840
that certain people
who do less than others.

1413
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.600
And I knew that. I'm a control freak.
So I'm an enabler.

1414
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.280
So I allow people to do nothing
because I'll do the work.

1415
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.240
So… that's kind of like where
a lot of systems probably came from.

1416
01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.560
-The card system?
-Yeah.

1417
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.560
It holds people responsible.
That's what it does.

1418
01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.920
If you're half an hour late
to a real life shoot.

1419
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.120
you get a yellow card.

1420
01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.200
If you're 15 minutes late
to an online shoot.

1421
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.240
it's a yellow card.

1422
01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.440
If you're not wearing Sidemen clothing
at a Sidemen shoot. it is a yellow card.

1423
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.920
And we have a tally of how many videos
we've all taken charge of on the channel.

1424
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.280
So if you get two yellows…
video gone.

1425
01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.200
Oh. no. no. no. no. No. no. no.

1426
01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.160
No. no. no. no.

1427
01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.880
-No. no. no.
-No. no. no.

1428
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.800
-You can't take five minutes to reply…
-Fuck it. Yeah.

1429
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.160
-…location.
-Stop. No. We've literally just…

1430
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.640
Fam. we told him to turn.
He didn't fucking turn.

1431
01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.080
-We were here I swear.
-No. no. It's a yellow.

1432
01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.400
-No. It's not.
-It's a yellow.

1433
01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.880
It's not a yellow. I'm here!

1434
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.760
-The majority decides end of the day.
-I'm here. bro!

1435
01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.680
-You can't argue with the majority.
-What? No.

1436
01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.600
It's a majority decision. It's a yellow.

1437
01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.200
Yeah but then… Because you're…

1438
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.440
Oh… Oh. he changes even though it's not.

1439
01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.000
Majority decision.

1440
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.280
Yeah. we managed to be. what.
a couple seconds late.

1441
01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.120
Er. I got very angry.

1442
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.920
<i>'cause no one wants a yellow card</i>
<i>because it means you have to do more work.</i>

1443
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.880
Yeah. I know. But it's just like…

1444
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.520
All right. All right.
Calm. Calm. All right.

1445
01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.800
When it was introduced.
it was alien to people.

1446
01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.120
When you talk about it to people.

1447
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.000
it seems like someone's at the top
controlling us.

1448
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.400
But it's just a democratic choice
that works.

1449
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.760
It means that there's fairness
across the group

1450
01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:35.080
there's a spread. er.
across everything we do.

1451
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.040
The way I see it from you two right now.
you're doing the.

1452
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.720
"Oh. but it's not fine for me."

1453
01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:44.080
-Do you… remember the Easter egg video?
-Other people… Yeah.

1454
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.800
I was there at one minute past…

1455
01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.560
I will back you on…

1456
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.280
Boys. calm. It's a yellow.

1457
01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.080
A-okay behind the scenes this is.

1458
01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.480
We need to film. come on.

1459
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.240
Within the Sidemen. obviously.
we have seven people

1460
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.960
and we have a sentence that rules all.

1461
01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.880
The majority decides.

1462
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.160
I think it's nice to have a voting system

1463
01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.880
and then for it not to become
an emotional debate.

1464
01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.600
It's just like. "It got voted.
I was outvoted.

1465
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.840
Fine. Let's proceed
as you guys think best."

1466
01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.120
I think YouTubers of that period

1467
01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.480
that it went from YouTubers made merch.
then they made books.

1468
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.080
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And then music came into it a little bit.

1469
01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:25.480
And then more recent times.
YouTubers are trying expand horizons

1470
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.440
like. "What business can we make?
We could be next big things."

1471
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.640
So then. we've always had all these ideas.

1472
01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.040
It's like you said… how do you build
a team to launch these things.

1473
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.960
Ideas that are relative to us

1474
01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.880
like doing mukbang. food round.
drinking videos.

1475
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.840
it's stuff that's relative to us
that we have an actual interest in

1476
01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:45.800
that will outlive just us as creators.

1477
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.200
-I hate business.
-You hate business?

1478
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.160
-I hate business.
-Do ya?

1479
01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.600
Yeah. I really like videos.
I don't like business.

1480
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.760
-But you like money so…
-No. I like the result of business.

1481
01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.200
-What does it mean by hating business?
-I don't like sitting in a meeting.

1482
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.240
Yeah. I get it. I get it.
You know what? I agree with that.

1483
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.160
Yeah. I like creating the video.

1484
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.640
But I think you also…

1485
01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.040
like there is a huge side of just creative
to a business.

1486
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.040
Hmm.

1487
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.680
I think the next trend for us is…
what I mean--

1488
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.680
You never know the next trend.

1489
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.200
No. I was gonna say entrepreneurs…

1490
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.400
-Entrepreneu-la-la-la-la-eur.
-It's entreprenueralship.

1491
01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.520
-There we go.
-So that's not content.

1492
01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.040
We're not making our YouTube videos
about our companies. So…

1493
01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.160
In YouTube. you never know
what the next thing is.

1494
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.800
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.
-There's a quote.

1495
01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.320
You either ride the wave.
or you get washed up.

1496
01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.960
Ooh!

1497
01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.920
Hey. Josh.

1498
01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800
Do you like it?

1499
01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.360
-Oh. you look good.
-Thank you.

1500
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.400
That's so deadly.

1501
01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.480
-I actually need you as a reference.
-Okay.

1502
01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.320
What is that little extra thong?
The thing at the back? I love it.

1503
01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.880
Got a little G-string on.

1504
01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.160
Some will be easier.

1505
01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.280
<i>Vik is a very business-savvy guy.</i>
<i>He's got a lot of investments.</i>

1506
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.520
<i>Pretty sure he's got seats</i>
<i>on the board of multiple companies.</i>

1507
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.960
He's about his money.
He's a very. very business-minded man.

1508
01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.240
<i>I grew up in a fairly typical</i>
<i>Indian family setting.</i>

1509
01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.840
<i>By the sense of the traditions</i>
<i>that our family is very important.</i>

1510
01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.120
<i>You must work very hard.</i>
<i>and it is important to succeed.</i>

1511
01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.560
<i>I was part of a local swimming club.</i>

1512
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:45.960
<i>They had me take lessons for the drums.</i>
<i>for the piano. for the violin.</i>

1513
01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.080
<i>always pushed me</i>
<i>to work really hard at school.</i>

1514
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.320
<i>I am now really. really grateful for that.</i>

1515
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.520
<i>And I think a big part of that for them</i>

1516
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.200
<i>were these were all of the things</i>
<i>that they weren't able to do growing up.</i>

1517
01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.760
-Hey.
-Nice to see you.

1518
01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.960
-And you.
-Hey. man. How you doing?

1519
01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.800
<i>Being able to have</i>
<i>those conversations about.</i>

1520
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.720
<i>"Hey. we're actually looking</i>
<i>for equity now</i>

1521
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.000
because we understand
that what we're doing for your business

1522
01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.680
isn't just gonna help tomorrow.

1523
01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.400
but it'll help for the next ten years
of your business."

1524
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.920
<i>I always had a bit</i>
<i>of an entrepreneurial spirit behind me.</i>

1525
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.280
<i>When I was in primary school.</i>
<i>I used to sell rulers.</i>

1526
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.600
<i>When I went to secondary school.</i>
<i>I started selling sweets to students</i>

1527
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.560
<i>and that allowed me</i>
<i>to buy my first set-up.</i>

1528
01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.840
<i>I've always had that innate desire</i>
<i>to use my own brainpower</i>

1529
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:37.160
to generate a revenue
and some form of worth as it were.

1530
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.320
<i>One of my granddads.</i>
<i>his entire dream in life</i>

1531
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.680
<i>was to become a successful businessman.</i>

1532
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.960
He had all of the books about
how to live in prosperity.

1533
01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.440
how to be a millionaire

1534
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.200
<i>and shame he's not still around today.</i>

1535
01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.880
but. I think. he'd very happy
with what I've been able to achieve.

1536
01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.760
Right Let's get it.

1537
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.320
Ministry. are you ready?

1538
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:08.800
Vik is multi-faceted. Like. he's so smart.
but he's also a lot of fun.

1539
01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.640
One. two. three Let's go.

1540
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.080
<i>He's driven and he gets it done. man.</i>

1541
01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.000
That's one thing I'll say about Vik.

1542
01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.160
When he sets about a task.
he will get it done.

1543
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.720
To go from a creator to a giant business.
you've gotta be a creator first.

1544
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:36.600
And a lot of people try to skip that step
or do it too early.

1545
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.520
I think for them. it's pretty easy

1546
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.360
because they've got
seven influential people.

1547
01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.240
<i>Then when you combine them together.</i>
<i>it's just cool what they do.</i>

1548
01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.800
<i>And so. you naturally</i>
<i>add their products to the mix.</i>

1549
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.920
<i>I don't think there's that many people.</i>

1550
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.520
<i>that have the ability to move product</i>
<i>like that on social media currently.</i>

1551
01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.800
<i>It will go up in the future.</i>

1552
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.280
but you could count 'em on your hands.
the ones that can move product.

1553
01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.480
and. obviously. they're one of them.
So it's very cool to see.

1554
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.720
The interesting one was
the paid for premium subscription service

1555
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.840
that we also launched called Side+.

1556
01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.080
<i>Currently. we offer like a podcast</i>
<i>and behind the scenes.</i>

1557
01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.320
<i>One of my favourite things about it</i>

1558
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.920
<i>is it's also a very powerful statement</i>
<i>about what we're able to build</i>

1559
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.520
<i>and how the platform we have now built</i>
<i>can exist outside of YouTube.</i>

1560
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.000
<i>And I think it gives us</i>
<i>a very powerful position</i>

1561
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.280
to proving that we can drive
more revenue off YouTube

1562
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.520
than we can on YouTube.
which is fantastic.

1563
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.960
<i>Side+ won't ever exist</i>
<i>without the Sidemen YouTube channel.</i>

1564
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.720
<i>A lot of people were worried</i>
<i>they're moving to a platform</i>

1565
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.560
<i>where we have to pay to watch them.</i>

1566
01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.640
<i>But the reason we made Side+</i>
<i>was to now fund the Sidemen videos.</i>

1567
01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.960
<i>And also. it's a chance for us</i>
<i>to interact with fans through giveaways.</i>

1568
01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.720
<i>We can do meet and greets.</i>
<i>We can do the spending stuff.</i>

1569
01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.640
And because of Side+.
Sidemen can go further.

1570
01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.880
Class.

1571
01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.760
So one. two. three. One. two. three.

1572
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.360

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.120
<i>cheap versus expensive.</i>

1585
01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.680
It's a staple of the boys' content.

1586
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.480
This time. instead of being hotels.
or. you know. holidays or road trips.

1587
01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.720
it was Christmas song.

1588
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.440
♪ <i>Empty your sack all in my crack ♪</i>

1589
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.880

1592
01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.560
<i>You've got "This or That"</i>
<i>which is a hilarious $100 track.</i>

1593
01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.160
You can tell it's made for a $100.
but it was brilliant in its own way.

1594
01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.440
Then "Christmas Drillings."

1595
01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.520
♪ <i>Christmas Drillings make a killing</i>

1598
01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.840

1601
01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.680
And off the back of that.
I remember Aaron messaged said.

1602
01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.520
"Guys do you wanna go
for a Christmas number one with this?

1603
01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.280
"Do you wanna actually try?"

1604
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.000
And then I remember JJ. Tobi
and a bunch of them in the song were like.

1605
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.400
"Yes. A hundred times yes. Please.
Let's try. Let's give it a go."

1606
01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.280
-We're doing this all without a label.
-Yeah. That's…

1607
01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.120
-Power to the people.
-That's exciting.

1608
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.080
I definitely think the whole
music-industry people understand

1609
01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.520
that you have to be doing it
through the label.

1610
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.040
but we'll show 'em.

1611
01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.840
And I think the… our whole journey.
unintentionally.

1612
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.600
has been about us saying.
"We'll do it ourselves."

1613
01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.600
We'll do it ourselves.

1614
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.560
"We'll do a charity match.
sell out a stadium."

1615
01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.080
And we had like stadiums saying to us.
"Oh. you can't fill out the stadium."

1616
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.720
Yeah. Do you mind?

1617
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.720
Yeah. yeah. Harry.
We're kind of doing a. er…

1618
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.000
We're doing…

1619
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.400
-Yeah. you could…
-Yeah. do it quietly.

1620
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.360
Okay. cool.

1621
01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.600
-This is the chaos.
-This is the shit house…

1622
01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.480
How we get anything done is a miracle.

1623
01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.720
How are we…

1624
01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.920
<i>If we're wanting attention.</i>
<i>this is one way to do it.</i>

1625
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.520
<i>We did this without expecting anything</i>
<i>from it.</i>

1626
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.160
<i>We're just making content for fun.</i>

1627
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.960
When you have a audience of our size that.
you know. the charts are possible.

1628
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:56.520
But to chart at Christmas.
when the competition is so high.

1629
01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.160
would be ridiculous.

1630
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.240
It is ridiculous
to even be in the conversation

1631
01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.160
for Christmas number one is like…

1632
01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.960
It's out of this world. man.

1633
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.560
"Christmas Drillings!"
What we saying people?

1634
01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:22.360
Lord. Big boy on the mic.

1635
01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.040
Oh. go on. people.

1636
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:28.240
Jeez. We are here in London
having the time of our lives.

1637
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.440
Jeez. Sidemen storming London.
It's mad.

1638
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.400
Oi. oi. oi!

1639
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.560
We wanted people to know that we believe
this song should really be number one.

1640
01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.240
and we wanted to drive that energy

1641
01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.560
to try and generate
those moments on social

1642
01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.160
where fans are creating TikToks.
they're creating Instagram stories.

1643
01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.720
<i>support "Christmas Drillings."</i>

1644
01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.200
Yeah!

1645
01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.480
"Christmas Drillings"
pick up the run.

1646
01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.320
"Christmas Drillings" still number one.

1647
01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.240
It's everywhere.
You cannot miss this vibe.

1648
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:06.480
We got a mad bus
for this. It's crazy.

1649
01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.800
We're trying to get our Christmas tune
to number one.

1650
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.760
Are you all ready? Shout Noel.

1651
01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.840
Oh. this is mine.
Oi! What's going on? Sorry.

1652
01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.840
Buy the song.
and don't get us arrested. please.

1653
01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.280
We won't get the Christmas number one.
We'll be in prison.

1654
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.520
Please clear the road.

1655
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.120
Please clear the road.

1656
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.400
-The feds are gonna lock us up.
-We'll totally get arrested.

1657
01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.840
-What do you think of Tottenham?
-Shit!

1658
01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.960
-What do you think is shit?
-Tottenham!

1659
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.320
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

1660
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.200
-That's fucking amazing.
-Come on.

1661
01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.640
I'll put you out of your misery.
No surprises.

1662
01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.440
because you guys are
the UK's Christmas number one!

1663
01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.360
Come on! Congratulations!

1664
01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.400
Getting that track into the charts alone
and doing what it did.

1665
01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.880
was a huge community effort

1666
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:32.440
<i>which actually goes</i>
<i>very much against the industry.</i>

1667
01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.320
<i>against capitalism in a sense.</i>

1668
01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.120
<i>very much the community</i>
<i>versus the big corporates</i>

1669
01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:41.000
<i>which I genuinely feel also resounds</i>
<i>really well with the Sidemen. in general.</i>

1670
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.880
<i>Like this community got this track</i>
<i>into the charts and beat Mariah Carey.</i>

1671
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.880
'Cause without a record label.
without pulling any strings.

1672
01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.320
without getting on any playlists.
over the radios.

1673
01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:54.360
without paying huge amounts of money
to do all the things you need to do.

1674
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.520
this was pure community.
And that's really special.

1675
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.680
I don't think that the mainstream media
will ever accept online content creators.

1676
01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.600
I think that there's still
a lot of rigidity

1677
01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.240
in the traditional media landscape.

1678
01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.280
There's a tremendous lack of diversity
that really prevents the forward thinking

1679
01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.440
that's required to see the innovation
and the potential in the online community.

1680
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.280
It's kind of like
old money versus new money.

1681
01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:25.040
And there's just… I see that distinction
so clearly sometimes in my job.

1682
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.600
where you see the. sort of.
very exciting digital frontier

1683
01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:32.480
and then this massive divide with this.
you know. with legacy media.

1684
01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.640
that's just unwilling to change.

1685
01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.280
<i>I think we've all changed</i>
<i>over the ten years.</i>

1686
01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.960
I think it's hard to say
who's changed the most.

1687
01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.560
I mean. physically.
Ethan's changed the most.

1688
01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:01.200
Mentally. I think it's gotta be Ethan.
especially having a kid now.

1689
01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.800
Yes. the first one of us to have a child.

1690
01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.840
It's mental. you know. because…
say we're watching the TV

1691
01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:12.080
<i>and I put a Sidemen video on</i>
<i>and she's gonna say. "Daddy's on the TV."</i>

1692
01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.960
And she's gonna have to grasp the fact
that. "Yes. your dad does this."

1693
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.000
<i>People comment on that.</i>

1694
01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.960
<i>It's gonna be really interesting.</i>
<i>Not sure how I'll work it out.</i>

1695
01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.520
Hopefully. I've got a little bit of time
to buy.

1696
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.360
<i>When families get involved</i>

1697
01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:29.120
<i>and you start having more and more babies</i>
<i>come in to the group.</i>

1698
01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.760
<i>that's another responsibility</i>
<i>that you've gotta deal with.</i>

1699
01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.720
It's another thing to take your time.
and that is a priority.

1700
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.360
family should always be your priority.

1701
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.760
<i>But if there's one thing</i>
<i>that history's proven.</i>

1702
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.200
<i>is that we're good at evolving.</i>

1703
01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.720
<i>For me. I've always found it</i>
<i>really important</i>

1704
01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.080
to slowly build and create a world
for myself

1705
01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.400
outside of content. outside of work.

1706
01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.800
<i>That makes us better as content creators</i>

1707
01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.600
<i>because it gives us</i>
<i>a wider experience of life</i>

1708
01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.160
<i>and that's the key. I think.</i>

1709
01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.240
I think my advice for any future
YouTube groups

1710
01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.360
is don't look at the Sidemen and go.
"I wanna be the next Sidemen."

1711
01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.960
<i>You can look at it and take aspects. cool.</i>

1712
01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.080
<i>But ours worked because it was natural.</i>
<i>We weren't trying to be someone else.</i>

1713
01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.560
We literally were just us.

1714
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.320
I know a lot of people look up to me.

1715
01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.480
So. I try to be the best human I can be.
But I'm a human.

1716
01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.800
<i>So. I'm gonna have flaws.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna be perfect.</i>

1717
01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.920
<i>You know. I feel like a lot of people</i>
<i>just through what I've done.</i>

1718
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.280
have been very inspired and influenced.
and it's so sick and cool to see.

1719
01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:32.320
The interesting one to see will be
how YouTube and this space develops.

1720
01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.640
and how we develop with it.

1721
01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.840
It's like a shift.
You have the television killing radio.

1722
01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.800
and now you have
like the internet killing television.

1723
01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.480
We're front and centre of that.

1724
01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.360
<i>And there'll be a lot of massive things</i>
<i>that will occur in these next ten years</i>

1725
01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.920
<i>that will make everyone realise</i>
<i>that has happened.</i>

1726
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.680
I think if we fail. we've had a stinker

1727
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.440
because it's like all there for taking.

1728
01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.880
<i>We're all very well known.</i>
<i>We're as big as we can be.</i>

1729
01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.080
<i>And we're full of like people</i>
<i>that are actually pretty switched on.</i>

1730
01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.360
So. I think. we're destined for greatness.
But it's not really my forte.

1731
01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.760
So if we are. we are.
If not. I'm happy with what we've got.
