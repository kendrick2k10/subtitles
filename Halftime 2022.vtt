00:30:45.468 --> 00:30:46.761
I've never seen you sick.

4
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.213
My friend's outside. She dances here.

5
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.062
We'll show Ms.Â J.Lo what you have.

6
00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:37.803
Darling. your body is better now.

7
00:53:23.158 --> 00:53:26.494
This is one of the smaller dresses
I've worn.

8
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:29.247
Is she gonna be able to sit in that dress?

9
00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:03.623
I'll miss it.

10
01:08:43.702 --> 01:08:46.122
They just don't want to give that shit up.

11
01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.809
They're saying 18 cages on the field.

12
01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:33.935
Being Latino in this country

13
01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:38.023
has always been a matter of pride for me.

14
01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.984
My family means a lot to me.

15
01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:44.279
And representing Latinos to the world.

16
01:19:44.362 --> 01:19:46.239
I know that's something that I do.

17
01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.325
Something that God has blessed me to do.

18
01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:52.496
There are many Latinos in this country.
and they are not being treated well.

19
01:19:53.079 --> 01:19:58.043
and that's why this show is so important.

20
01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:01.546
And you are all a big part of that.

21
01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:08.820
One nation under God. indivisible

22
01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.739
with liberty and justice for all.
