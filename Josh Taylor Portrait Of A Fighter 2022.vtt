00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.840
This programme contains
very strong language

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.760
ANNOUNCER:  From Prestonpans.
Edinburgh. Scotland...

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.880
..Josh "The Tartan Tornado" Taylor!

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.560
When I was in primary school.
I said.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.200
"I want to be rich and famous
like a superstar pop star

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.800
"or something. or a footballer"

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.960
and never. ever imagined
that it would come true.

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.240
or I would be a world champion
boxer. for even that matter.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.560
COMMENTATOR:  And Josh Taylor has
won gold at the Commonwealth Games!

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.920
I was aware of Josh from right back.
you know. the Lochend Boxing Club.

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.840
Everybody in the boxing fraternity
would be talking about him

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.400
all the time. It's just been
this kind of relentless rise.

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.320
COMMENTATOR:  The Tartan Tornado
is world champion

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.200
after only 15 professional fights.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.920
People see Fury and AJ as the
top fighters in the UK.

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.000
but what Josh Taylor has
done already in his career

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.600
has probably surpassed anything
they've done put together.

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.640
He's a special. special fighter.

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.480
COMMENTATOR:  Big left hand
drops Jose Ramirez!

20
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.240
There's only been five other
fighters in boxing history

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.400
to have become undisputed
world champion.

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.000
The undisputed champion
of the world...

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.880
..Josh "The Tartan Tornado" Taylor!

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.440
You just see the buzz when Scotland
are playing well.

25
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.880
when Andy Murray's doing well -

26
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.480
and Josh is absolutely
amongst those names.

27
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.800
He's a Scotland great.

28
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.720
And I think what's exciting is he's
nowhere near where he wants to be.

29
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.440
Josh Taylor and Jack Catterall
will battle it out in Glasgow

30
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.680
for the undisputed super lightweight
ten-stone treasure.

31
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.560
It's a completely different pressure
going to the ring as the champion.

32
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960
with nothing to gain from it.

33
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.520
The moment he steps in through those
ropes. the belts go up in the air.

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.280
Every fight that he has now.

35
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.360
it's. "This is his biggest
fight of his career."

36
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.040
And. obviously. it's on home soil
this time. so I think. you know.

37
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.880
you're going to be feeling the
pressure to put a good show on.

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520
Jack Catterall is a very.
very good fighter.

39
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.400
He's beaten every opponent that's
been put in front of him.

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.040
But I've got bigger plans and bigger
goals that I've set out to do.

41
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.840
I want to become a two-weight
undisputed world champion.

42
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.960
something that no-one has
ever done in the sport.

43
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.440
That would be me leaving
an everlasting name

44
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.880
and legacy in the sport of boxing.

45
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.640
CHANTING:  Chorley! Chorley! Chorley!

46
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.120
ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen.
after 12 rounds here

47
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.880
inside OVO Hydro. we go
to the judges' scorecards

48
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.480
for the official decision.

49
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.720
And still undisputed...

50
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.720
CROWD CHEERS

51
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.320
..super lightweight champion
of the world.

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.160
The Tartan Tornado.

53
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.680
Josh Taylor!

54
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.520
COMMENTATOR:  That is
absolutely stunning!

55
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.200
Josh Taylor retains his titles
on a split decision.

56
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.640
Bullshit!  Fucking
cheating...!  Bullshit.

57
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.840
# There's only one Josh Taylor!

58
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.440
Come on. Josh!

59
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.720
If this wasn't in Scotland tonight.
Jack would've won.

60
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.320
You know that. I know that.

61
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.760
COMMENTATOR:  Take nothing away from
Josh Taylor's effort and his spirit.

62
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.320
But. for us. Jack Catterall
should be the undisputed champion.

63
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.560
Wasn't my best. like. eh?

64
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.600
That's how it is. eh?
I'm all right. Sweet.

65
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.280
You all right?  Uh-huh...

66
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.480
Don't feel a thing?  Nope.  Good.

67
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.800
Oh...

68
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.520
Pissed off.

69
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.000
I just don't get it.

70
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.960
Jack won the fight. for me.

71
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.600
Aye. you're all good.

72
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.400
Aw. fuck!

73
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.200
MOTOR SPUTTERS

74
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.400
Ah. fucking hell...

75
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.400
MOTOR STARTS

76
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.240
MOTOR CUTS OUT

77
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.240
Oh...

78
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.840
I've got to give up.

79
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.320
HE LAUGHS

80
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.840
That's what happens when
you let your grass

81
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.560
grow and grow like a jungle.

82
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.880
MOTOR CUTS OUT

83
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.240
Ah. fuck's sake.

84
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.880
What's going on here?

85
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.400
MOTOR CUTS OUT

86
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.000
Oh...!

87
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.040
Don't you dare put
this on the telly.

88
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.520
I'll sue the hell out of you.

89
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.560
You better no' put this
on the BBC. I'm telling you.

90
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.000
"Cannae even cut his fucking grass."

91
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.920
Aw. man. look at
all that. though. man.

92
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.040
See how perfect the other
side is. Tom?

93
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.320
Beautiful.

94
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.200
FAUX AMERICAN ACCENT: "Beautiful!"

95
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.760
I live in Haddington. which is
about eight miles

96
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.600
just from where I grew
up. in Prestonpans.

97
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.440
and it's about 15 miles
east of Edinburgh.

98
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.000
Neighbours will get some laugh
watching me doing that.

99
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.320
It was a great place to grow up.

100
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.880
We had lots of freedom.
we had the sea on our back door.

101
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.080
we had lots of countryside
on our doorstep.

102
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.760
Quite a tough little place.

103
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.200
You know. you had to
learn to defend yourself

104
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.400
and. you know. look after yourself.

105
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.920
There's not many people where
I'm from. who are my friends.

106
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.920
that didn't grow up fighting.

107
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.320
Prestonpans is an old mining town.

108
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.920
It's escaped the gentrification
that a lot of these towns have had.

109
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.600
Places like Haddington and
North Berwick

110
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.160
have had the influx of
commuters from Edinburgh.

111
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.600
Prestonpans has probably been one
of the towns that's kept it real.

112
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.840
basically. in that
part of the world.

113
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.480
This is a house that
I grew up in - here.

114
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.160
Two-bedroom council house.

115
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.240
Lived here till I was. like.
25. 26 years old. so...

116
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.080
Paddy!

117
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.640
Ah. dear...! That's sweet...!

118
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.440
He used to leave notes about
the house when he was a kid...

119
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.120
..saying he was going
to be world champion.

120
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.640
And we found that.

121
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.320
He must have been about ten.

122
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.360
Oh. he was just so headstrong.

123
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.480
He was competitive
at everything he done.

124
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.680
We could sit and eat a bowl
of cornflakes. and I'll say.

125
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.480
"I'll race you." and he would just
stuff them in his face. just to win.

126
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.680
I just knew way back then
he was a bit special. he was...

127
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.240
He was gonnae be something.

128
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.000
He was funny. he was a funny wee...
He's was a funny lad. eh?

129
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.880
He used to like to take his clothes
off and run about naked...  Aye.

130
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.480
..and do the Full Monty and things.

131
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.760
He was really good
at the Full Monty.

132
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.240
The Full Monty would come on...

133
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.720
He would have to start...
Start taking his clothes off..!

134
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.520
I still do want to be a
part of the Full Monty.

135
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.840
"What do you want to be
when you're bigger. Josh?"

136
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.560
"A stripper."

137
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.280
He's just always full of fun.

138
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.600
No. but he wasnae always. He was
a pain in the backside sometimes.

139
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.000
People coming to the door. saying
he'd thrown stones at their windows

140
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.240
and complaining about him
fighting with their boys. and...

141
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.320
Aye. just your usual kid stuff.

142
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.760
That's Josh when he was a baby.

143
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.200
Long legs and long arms.

144
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.400
Look at the state of this.

145
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.880
I had a great upbringing.

146
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.080
My dad was a landscape gardener
for Edinburgh Council.

147
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.880
My mum was a receptionist
at Meadowbank Sports Centre.

148
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.920
They worked every
hour under the sun.

149
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.880
They worked really. really hard
for myself. for my little sister

150
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.640
to enjoy things and have good
clothes. have good stuff.

151
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.760
Sometimes we didn't have enough
to put petrol in the car

152
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.920
to get him to training.
but we got there somehow.

153
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.080
Jamie worked really hard. as well.

154
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.520
He used to work two jobs.
I had two jobs.

155
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.480
It was quite hard.

156
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.760
It was hard going. trying to keep
them getting what they want

157
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.520
and making sure they
were fine for everything.

158
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.360
It did put a lot of strain on mine
and Jamie's marriage at some times.

159
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.080
At first. it was quite a shock to
Finch and Josh that we'd split up.

160
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.960
because we've been together
since we were at high school.

161
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.000
like. 12. 13-year-old. so that's.
like. longer than a lifetime.

162
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.280
And I think it was a shock to quite
a lot of people that we split up.

163
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.520
But. do you know what?
We're getting on fine now.

164
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.600
There's Josh...  That's the
craziest person I've ever met.

165
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.920
Who's that?

166
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.560
Diane when she was a lass.

167
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.320
I'm no' really crazy.
I'm quite a nice person.

168
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.120
Dinnae believe him. Tom.

169
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.160
There was always a bit of
tooth and nail with the two of them.

170
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.480
arguing like cat and dog.

171
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.640
I think a lot of it was

172
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.200
because they were spending

173
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.080
all their time working to provide
for myself and Finch.

174
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.600
I think it took its
toll on them sometimes.

175
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.560
You know. they'd let things build
up. build up. and build up.

176
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.480
and then they would explode.

177
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.200
It was crazy at times. and mad at
times. but whose family isn't?

178
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.800
If it wasn't for my mum and dad.
I wouldn't be where I am today.

179
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.480
You know. fact.

180
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.400
They worked their socks off to
give us everything that they had.

181
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.440
Paddy. this way.

182
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.760
As Josh was brought up.
he just went out playing

183
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.120
and running about all the time.

184
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.880
That's all we had to do with him
when we were youngsters

185
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.280
but nowadays. you dinnae see
any kids about the place.

186
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.880
They're all sitting in their houses
playing their PlayStations.

187
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.720
That's what I see as different
about town here. Prestonpans.

188
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.880
I think. you know. a lot of working
class. cos they've been left behind.

189
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.800
and it's not just in Prestonpans.

190
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.240
I mean. I see it where. you know.
where I grew up in Muirhouse.

191
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.160
There's not a lot for them.

192
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.440
and recreational space
is sold off to developers.

193
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.960
You know. you see what happens
is that obesity rates rise.

194
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.960
What Josh has done. and what
leading sports people have done.

195
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.840
they kind of reverse that trend.

196
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.600
They encourage kids to get into
sport. they encourage kids to join

197
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.440
the local boxing club. to join
the local five-a-side league.

198
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.400
But the facilities have to be there.

199
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.800
Otherwise. it's just drugs
and street corners. basically.

200
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.280
This is. like. the bit where we
sort of used to hang around

201
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.080
when we were. like. little kids.

202
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.320
See. the running track's no' in
very good nick any more.

203
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.560
cos the gate's shut.
nobody's using it.

204
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.080
Kids are having to break the things
in the fence just to get in

205
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.520
and get a game of football.

206
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.800
It's quite crap to see.

207
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.080
But there's some lads climbed
in over the fence here.

208
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.720
so we'll go and see what they say.

209
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.800
It's Josh Taylor!

210
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.640
Sting. Aw. what a game that was.

211
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.920
On the seventh goal. you have to
either header it or backheel it in.

212
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.080
Once you get seven in.
you've got to turn around.

213
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.560
put your arse in the air.

214
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.200
and the lads put the ball
on the penalty spot.

215
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.040
and everybody gets a free dig
at your backside.

216
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.840
If you refuse to let
everybody have a shot at you.

217
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.520
you get a thing called
the magic circle.

218
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.640
You've just got to protect yourself.
and everybody gets to set about you.

219
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.240
It's a pretty brutal game. but
it is exciting. it's pretty good.

220
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.200
I used to love playing that
when I was a kid. like.

221
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.520
Is it still the same?
Do you still play the same way?

222
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.440
Seven. and then 14. the
kegs down. and 21. bare arse.

223
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.600
Aye...!  Then if nobody...
You get the magic circle.

224
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.680
Aye. magic circle.
Get battered...

225
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.760
That's actually quite nice to
see.that. That's quite funny.

226
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.760
Brings back a lot of memories.

227
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.160
All right. boys?
Away to play football?

228
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.320
There's a wee hole in the fence.

229
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.600
All that hassle to try and
get a wee game of football.

230
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.080
For me. that's shocking.
It should be open.

231
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.040
It used to be free and open.

232
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.720
Can me and my friends
get a group photo?

233
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.080
Of course. lads.

234
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.360
In my fights. when they
get introduced as.

235
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.760
"And from Edinburgh. Josh Taylor..."

236
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.960
Enjoy your game of football. See you
later. wee man.

237
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.400
See yous later. boys.

238
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.520
..I said to a couple of announcers
early on. I says.

239
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.960
"I'm no' from Edinburgh.

240
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.520
"I'd like you to say my
hometown. Prestonpans."

241
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.360
And you had Michael Buffer
shouting it -

242
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.480
"From Prestonpans. Josh Taylor!"

243
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.280
It's brilliant.

244
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.560
I'm really proud of that fact. that
I've put Prestonpans on the map.

245
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.680
and people around here are
proud of that fact. as well.

246
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.240
It gives a lot of the
kids around here...

247
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.200
To reach the heights of where
you want to go. it's not...

248
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.080
you don't have to be
from a certain place.

249
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.080
I'm real. I'm living it.
I'm right there.

250
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.600
Like. if I can do it. the kids
can do what they want. as well.

251
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.560
Is my blue one there?  Drying.

252
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.040
Are they? Right. that's fine.

253
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.520
And there's other stuff
in the washing machine.

254
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.320
Are they yours?
Take them if you want...!

255
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.840
They might be quite nice on me.
Wee hot pants.

256
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.840
Oosh!

257
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.880
On Monday. I'm going down to Essex

258
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.440
and back to the gym with my coach.
Ben. and all the lads.

259
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.600
and start training camp.

260
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.680
I will be a wee bit lost.
I think. when he goes back.

261
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.000
My house will be nice and tidy.

262
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.600
He just leaves everything
lying on his backside.

263
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.160
But things get back to business now.

264
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.800
Every fight that he has now.

265
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.120
it's. "This is his biggest
fight in his career.

266
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.880
"And now this is..."

267
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.280
So. every fight is. like.
at the top.

268
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.200
Ready to go.

269
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.080
I might see him. maybe.
three or four times. maybe.

270
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.560
I just feel like he needs
just to have that space.

271
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.840
and just get on with training and...

272
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.400
..just be in the zone.

273
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.400
Sorted.

274
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.640
I've been working with
Josh Taylor for about 18 months.

275
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.240
and his career. up to date.
has been extraordinary.

276
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.840
Josh has achieved numerous
titles throughout his career.

277
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.640
Obviously. an Olympian.

278
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.080
Gold medal at the 2014
Commonwealth Games.

279
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.160
What's happening. mate?
Yeah. good. man.

280
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.640
How are you doing? This is...

281
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.280
I've been away for about six months.

282
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.040
JOSH LAUGHS

283
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.400
When he turned professional.
he took to it like a duck to water.

284
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.160
Josh won his first world title
in just his 15th fight.

285
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.320
He went on to become undisputed
champion in just his 18th fight.

286
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.040
There's four different world titles.

287
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.360
and it's very rare for those
champions to face each other.

288
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.280
When they do. and somebody has
all of the belts - like Josh -

289
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.400
and has beaten every single other
champion in his weight category.

290
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.240
that means you become the
undisputed champion of the world.

291
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.160
Pizza belly. Tom.

292
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.680
Wee dad bod.

293
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.440
Every fight is different.

294
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.720
When they've achieved a goal
they've had for such a long time.

295
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.840
it's a huge relief. and everybody
deals with that differently.

296
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.400
I'm just over 12st. about 12.02st.

297
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.360
12.03st. maybe.

298
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.640
I need to get down to 10st.

299
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.600
I've been known to work with
fighters that really pack on

300
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.800
the weight. so...
Look. it's not the end of the world.

301
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.200
But boxing is the truth.

302
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.040
There's no hiding.

303
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.040
When you get in there.
the truth will come out.

304
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.880
If you've not put the work in.

305
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.400
if you've cut corners.

306
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.880
the truth will come out.

307
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.680
As brutal as it is.
it's beautifully brutal.

308
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.680
I've known Josh for a long time.

309
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.840
I've basically followed Josh's
footsteps from the amateur days.

310
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.920
I don't think we would push
ourselves as much as what we do

311
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.280
if we didn't have each other...

312
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.160
Ah. fucking hell. man.

313
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.120
..because I just feel like you
physically can't push yourself

314
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.920
that much unless you've got someone
there who's maybe just above you.

315
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.560
That's why you get that extra 10-20%
out of yourself in the training.

316
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.640
JOSH EXCLAIMS

317
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.800
Fuck...  Eh?

318
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.120
Fuck.

319
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.360
It's a lonely life at times.
you know.

320
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.720
and I'm very lucky that I've got my
little brother. Lee McGregor.

321
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.240
going through the same thing.

322
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.080
So. we kind of bounce off each other

323
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.840
and get each other through it.

324
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.440
Mate. I'll see you in a wee while.
See you in a bit.  See you in a bit.

325
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.640
I'm an Edinburgh
lad. I'm a Hearts fan. Jambo.

326
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.120
and Josh is a Hibs fan.
So. it's two Edinburgh teams.

327
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.920
There's needle and there's banter.

328
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.080
It depends how
serious people take it.

329
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.160
Me and Josh are pretty laid back
with it. but when the two teams meet

330
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.400
and they play each other.

331
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.120
we're both. obviously.
winding each other up.

332
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.080
We need to go on the
pitch at half-time.

333
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.920
during a Hibs-Hearts game.

334
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.760
and we need to have a penalty
shoot-out. How good would that be?

335
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.480
Aye. that would be good.

336
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.840
When I'm down in Essex. I live
in a house with five other lads.

337
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.280
We all stay together and live.
breathe and eat boxing together.

338
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.200
Have you had a haircut today. Josh?

339
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.440
Yesterday.

340
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.240
What are you copying my beard for?

341
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.560
Oh.  Fucking itching like mad.

342
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.000
Oh.  Itching like mad.

343
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.720
I'll keep saying until you answer.

344
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.280
It's itching like mad.
OK. very good!

345
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.720
It's Leo's house.

346
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.440
What a character he is.
Amazing. He's some lad.

347
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.440
Playing his favourite game -
round the board.  Right. I'm on ten.

348
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.240
Who's touching...?  Sorry. I never
meant it.

349
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.920
Don't touch the light switch.

350
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.400
Wee Scotsman under a bit of pressure

351
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.960
and you're trying to
fuck my game up.

352
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.640
LAUGHTER
Go on. then. What are you on?

353
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.960
Bull's-eye.  25. I'm on 25 now.

354
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.640
What? Have you hit the green one?

355
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.520
I'm on the green now.

356
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.920
There you are.
Just above it. Good marker.

357
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.480
Ho. ho. ho. ho! Oh. what a shot.

358
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.640
That was amazing. That was amazing.

359
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.200
I've shared rooms
with Josh many times

360
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.280
and I just think
he's got so much energy.

361
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.640
I would love to get some
of the energy from him.

362
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.000
I've got clips on my phone from us
in hotel rooms and it's like 12am

363
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.480
and we're sharing the room.
and Josh is up in front of me.

364
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.440
He's shadow boxing and
I'm trying to sleep.

365
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.200
Boom. boom. boom! Ah. shite!

366
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.240
Josh is...

367
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.960
He's an intense character.

368
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.880
Boom. boom. boom! Ah. fuck!

369
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.400
Have a breather. On the next one.

370
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.000
Intensity is the
price of excellence.

371
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.560
So. because he has that mentality
and he's that...that intensity.

372
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.520
whatever he focuses on.
he'll do well on.

373
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.760
Fucking hell.  What?
I'm not half breathing.

374
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.480
I've got such high standards

375
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.880
and expectations of myself

376
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.480
that. if I don't meet them
or hit them straight away.

377
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.160
I get a little bit
frustrated with myself.

378
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.200
So is that it?  Yeah.

379
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.040
That will do you today.

380
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.880
Will I do one more?

381
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.200
No. that'll do. Six.

382
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.040
People need to hold me back

383
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.240
because then I would go and hit
the bags for as long as I could.

384
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.120
knacker myself out. then
I'd be knackered tomorrow.

385
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.280
I wouldn't be able to train
tomorrow as well or as efficiently

386
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.560
because I'll been knackered
from the day before.

387
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.120
Time.

388
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.840
No. it's not that. It's just...

389
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.720
You say that at every camp!

390
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.800
It's just time. innit?

391
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.480
It takes time to get back
to what you used to.

392
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.960
He's fucking nuts. he is.

393
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.960
He thinks a couple of hard
sessions is going to fix it.

394
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.480
It just takes time.

395
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.160
Right now. the main focus
is basically preparing his body

396
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.920
for the tough task ahead.

397
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.680
to prevent any injuries.

398
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.640
so we make it to the fight
safe and sound. God willing.

399
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.240
COUGHING

400
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.000
Yeah.

401
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.960
HE COUGHS

402
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.120
The cough's still no'
properly cleared up yet.

403
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.280
HE COUGHS

404
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.280
And again. Oh.

405
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.600
I caught Covid as well last month.

406
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.040
so I think it's a
bit of that as well.

407
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.920
Then I caught a chest infection.

408
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.240
then I've picked up my knee injury

409
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.760
and I'm not able to really run
or lift weights properly

410
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.480
or. even in boxing at certain shots
I'm throwing. it's really hurting

411
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.920
my leg and giving me a shooting
pains in my legs.

412
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.960
My body's a little
bit less conditioned

413
00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.160
than what is usually is.

414
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.120
You know. that's
probably half the reason

415
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.000
why I've picked
up a couple of injuries.

416
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.680
Nah?

417
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.760
Josh having his injuries and illness
at the moment is an issue.

418
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.320
This is the ultimate prize in boxing

419
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.960
and Jack will be making sure
that he comes at 100%.

420
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.600
so we need to make
sure Josh is 100%.

421
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.240
Unfortunately. we're going
to have to push the fight back.

422
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.920
RADIO:  While West Ham brushed aside
Genk by three goals to nothing.

423
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.640
Boxing and Josh Taylor's
December 18th World Title defence

424
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.280
against Jack Catterall
has had to be postponed

425
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.640
after Taylor suffered a knee injury.

426
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.520
The fight in Glasgow will now
go ahead on the new date

427
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.080
of February 26th.

428
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.440
I'm gutted at the fact that I can't
fight the week before Christmas.

429
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.680
having to cancel Christmas
and keep training and...

430
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.000
..keep dedicated. so...

431
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.920
It's hard. Everybody says. "Oh.
you're so lucky you're doing this.

432
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.160
"you're doing that."
But you're away from family.

433
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.160
You're away from
your home comforts.

434
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.800
you're away from your
friends. my fiancee. and...

435
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.840
..putting your body through a
whole lot of torture and pain.

436
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.160
and you're kind of
miserable at times.

437
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.800
You know. it's not all big
lights and glamorous stuff.

438
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.880
You know. it's a very. very
hard way to earn a living.

439
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.880
This is traditional Friday
night if Josh comes home.

440
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.840
I've had two deaths in
the family since...

441
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.680
..and Josh has been. like.
in camp for them as well.

442
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.880
so I know that he felt really bad
because he couldn't be with me.

443
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.640
Times like that.
that's when it's tough.

444
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.960
My dad was such a friendly guy.
the best dad to me and my brother.

445
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.240
Even though you're grieving
and. you know. you're feeling

446
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.800
all these emotions. unfortunately.
you just need to keep going on.

447
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.400
I was on the phone to
Danielle and she was crying

448
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.920
and. you know. I was
trying to play brave.

449
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.600
And I come off the phone and
I'd have a cry myself and. like.

450
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.080
break down in tears and then I'd
have to go to the gym. you know?

451
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.840
And I had to block it out.

452
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.640
and I felt so bad that...

453
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.840
..that I couldn't be there
for them emotionally. you know?

454
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.440
So I still feel bad
about now and...

455
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.920
..I miss James so much as well.

456
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.560
So. yeah. it was hard. Yeah.

457
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.040
Being with someone
that's in sports.

458
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.520
there's always something
going on in our lives.

459
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.480
so there's always
something to focus on.

460
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.560
And just now. obviously.
it's Josh's fight.

461
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.680
And then obviously the wedding.

462
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.800
the wedding preparations
are keeping me busy.

463
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.760
What's happening? All right?  Hi.

464
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.040
We've been together 11 years now.

465
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.040
so we've been together a long time.

466
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.360
We never really had a normal
relationship. so to speak.

467
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.840
because I was always
away and training.

468
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.760
and so we never really got to spend
an awful lot of time together.

469
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.560
So. when I did come back.
we would go and do stuff.

470
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.960
stuff that was a luxury for us.

471
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.960
even just going for something to eat
together. going to the pictures.

472
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.600
or even just go on a drive.

473
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.160
spend a bit of time together.

474
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.280
If I was maybe not enjoying boxing
at times. struggling with stuff.

475
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.240
she was like. "Keep at it.
This is your dream.

476
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.040
"It's your goal. Keep at it.
You can do it."

477
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.000
And she's been at my
back the whole way.

478
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.240
We actually met through my cousin.

479
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.280
Josh comes up drunk and
he sits down beside me.

480
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.920
and I'm like. "Hiya."

481
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.400
And he went.

482
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.880
"I hear that you're into me
and that you think I'm tidy."

483
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.160
And I just turned round and I'm
like. "Who the fuck are you?"

484
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.680
"I didn't know who he was!"

485
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.400
And both of us turned
round and looked at my cousin.

486
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.720
and he was. like.
killing himself laughing.

487
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.000
And then we just got talking
after that because obviously Josh

488
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.960
knew then that it was
kind of like a set-up.

489
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.400
So with that night we just
sat and chatted for ages.

490
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.600
and had a wee dance together.

491
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.800
He made me feel at ease with him.

492
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.880
He was always giving me compliments.

493
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.240
And. still to this day. I'm not a
very confident person within myself

494
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.400
and I always kind of bring myself
down and he's like. "No. no. no.

495
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.120
"You know. you're this. you're
that. you're beautiful."

496
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.680
and. you know. all that stuff.

497
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.520
And I think really. he's helped
me grow as a person as well.

498
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.560
How many's coming in the bus?
How many's coming in this?

499
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.640
I'll jump in the bus.
I'll go in the bus.

500
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.560
This is my cousin David. and cousin
Stuart. and my cousin Steven.

501
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.160
All right?

502
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.960
La familia.

503
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.960
LAUGHTER

504
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.680
Used to wind me up something rotten
all the time when I was a.

505
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.040
when I was a kid. like. but...

506
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.240
Cannae do it now. can you?!  No.

507
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.000
We're on the way through to Glasgow.

508
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.680
getting sized up for the kilts

509
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.640
and get all measured up to get all
the stuff sorted for the wedding.

510
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.640
You know. just when we're getting
married. it's nice to keep

511
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.840
the family tradition and
the tartan and that alive.

512
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.640
Also. on the day. I'll
be true Scotsman as well.

513
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.200
so better put some Vaseline
on for the old chafing.

514
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.160
WOLF WHISTLES

515
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.560
What do you think. boys?

516
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.880
How you doing?  Looking smart.
That is nice.

517
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.640
Oh. perfect. man.
It's quality. innit?

518
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.080
During the kilt fitting.

519
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.440
I met a young lad that wanted me
to sign a set of gloves for him.

520
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.120
So. what are you
studying at college?

521
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.320
His mother sources the tartan
and the stuff for the shop.

522
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.040
He told me he'd been struggling
from autism

523
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.760
and boxing really.
really helped him.

524
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.080
It's good that you...got
through it yourself.

525
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.000
improved. socially and
everything. it's amazing.

526
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.840
That's really cheered me up. that.

527
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.480
He was getting bullied at school
and things like that.

528
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.760
and he went to the boxing gym and
says within a couple of weeks.

529
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.280
he kind of started making friends

530
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.280
and started coming out
of his shell a wee bit

531
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.680
and was able to talk to people.
He's at college now.

532
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.280
he's doing computing and stuff.

533
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.520
Maybe see you at a club show
or fighting one day. maybe.

534
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.520
Let me know when you're fighting and
I'll come along and watch you.

535
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.080
He wouldn't stop smiling at all.

536
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.440
Good on him.

537
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.400
Amazing. man. Brilliant.
I'll go home and greet about that.

538
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.760
Yeah. I was just thinking...  It's
quite inspirational. It's nice.

539
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.440
It's brilliant. especially...

540
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.240
You hear things like that.
what boxing can do for people.

541
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.720
not just fighting...  Brings you out
your shell. aye.  Aye. It's amazing.

542
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.520
like. what it can do. Brilliant.

543
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.560
Believe it or not. as a kid.

544
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.040
I was quite shy in terms of what I
wanted to get and go after things.

545
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.440
and I never really
believed in myself.

546
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.240
Boxing helped me in that
way and helped me grow

547
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.880
self-confidence and self-belief.
and gave me my self-worth.

548
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.400
Everyone else sort of seen the
talent that I had except for me.

549
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.200
He came in the gym one
night with his father.

550
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.000
looking for some sparring.

551
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.520
You see if they've got a
bit pop in their punches

552
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.400
and that's really the first
thing. you think. "Oh. wow.

553
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.840
"this guy's genetically strong."

554
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.360
And then you look for a
bit of speed.

555
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.160
Through time. you look to see
if they're going to stick it

556
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.800
because a lot of kids that come in.

557
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.880
they'll maybe be here two or three
weeks

558
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.680
and then you dinnae see them again.

559
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.520
but Josh was different.

560
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.640
He... He just kept turning up and.

561
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.840
you know. and never
missed a session.

562
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.160
I think he would rather
die than lose at anything.

563
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.960
Anything...  Even
walking along the street...

564
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.640
..I want to beat people at walking.

565
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.880
So competitive.

566
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.600
I've never met anyone that's had
a bad word to say about Terry.

567
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.800
You know. I love him.

568
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.840
You know. he's been there
for me since I was 17.

569
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.840
You know. I could go to him and
talk to him about any problems

570
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.360
that I had in my life and he would
give me sound advice all the time.

571
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.920
He goes out of his way to
help people in the community.

572
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.520
People go from all over
the place to Lochend now

573
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.040
because Terry is just...is a
good guy and he'll help you.

574
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.440
There's not much in Lochend.

575
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.520
There's like a football boys' club
up the road and there's us.

576
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.800
but we care for everyone
and it's a right community gym.

577
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.320
There's a lot of mental health
going around just now

578
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.200
through COVID and stuff. people
being locked down and that.

579
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.520
I just don't understand
why they lock gyms

580
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.120
and open like McDonald's
and KFC and stuff.

581
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.440
The mental health and the
suicides went through the roof.

582
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.680
You had them
running out on the beach.

583
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.520
in the freezing cold. and all that.

584
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.640
Aye. it was bad. bad times.

585
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.600
what the government done with Covid.
shutting people's lives down.

586
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.160
Josh has done amazing things
for Scottish boxing.

587
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.840
They see him coming
out of this wee hut

588
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.400
in Lochend and they think.
"We can do it."

589
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.000
He's made them believe. Scotland
used to be kind of the whipping dog

590
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.600
of the boxing world.

591
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.160
If you got drawn a Scottish guy
back in the day. it was like a bye.

592
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.280
Now. the world is like.
"That Josh Taylor is Scottish.

593
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.880
"They must be good boxers."

594
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.920
Josh has inspired these kids
to push on and go for the medals

595
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.000
in the big tournaments.

596
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.240
You'd be here all night.

597
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.480
If it was up to you. you'd
never get away from here.

598
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.280
The journey has just
been like a dream. eh?

599
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.560
I mean. it's everybody's dream to
be part of a journey

600
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.200
that involves somebody winning
everything right up to the pinnacle

601
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.440
of a world title and
then becoming undisputed.

602
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.360
To be part of that is just.

603
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.200
it's a special. special moment.

604
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.680
Last week. Ben said that he was
going to Vegas for a number of weeks

605
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.040
and I just said. "Yeah.
sign me up. I'm coming."

606
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.720
We are all going over there
for like three or four weeks.

607
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.600
myself and Lee McGregor getting a
good bit of training camp done

608
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.800
and get where we want to be.

609
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.920
All the massive fights have
been in Vegas and my best fight.

610
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.200
my biggest achievement.
was in Vegas as well.

611
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.200
Welcome inside the brand-new Virgin
Hotel. here in Las Vegas. Nevada.

612
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.360
It was a good. hostile
atmosphere. in the lion's den.

613
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.040
because obviously it
was restricted crowd.

614
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.320
It was only. I think.
1.000 people in

615
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.480
and the majority were for Ramirez.

616
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.520
Good left hand. Drops Jose Ramirez.

617
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.680
I genuinely started to get
worried at one point

618
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.720
because...because it was four
in the morning and I was steaming.

619
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.960
But also it seemed so one-sided

620
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.680
that you felt something
was going to go wrong.

621
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.280
you're going to get caught with a
lucky punch or something

622
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.520
and go down. but he just
never looked in trouble.

623
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.960
And for a fight of that magnitude.

624
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.920
it just shows you how
far Josh has come.

625
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.800
Great memories. you know.

626
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.280
memories that will last me
for the rest of my life.

627
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.080
ANNOUNCER:  Josh Taylor!

628
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.760
With it being my best
achievement in my career.

629
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.320
it was a little bit tainted
because COVID

630
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.880
and the restrictions with travelling
and getting into America.

631
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.760
the people that mean the most to me

632
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.880
couldn't come with me
and share that moment.

633
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.120
I'm still super
happy with what I did.

634
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.600
but I believe we can go back
and I'll keep winning.

635
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.720
and we can go back and do it again.

636
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.880
It would be nice to experience
what most people come over here

637
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.560
to experience. but I'm afraid
we've got different dreams.

638
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.120
I've come here with less tan
than I came - even more pale -

639
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.600
so I've not seen any sun at all.

640
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.840
We've been just seeing
the gym and the house.

641
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.720
and the gym and the house.

642
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.240
Only a couple of times we've
had the opportunity to get out

643
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.120
and actually explore a little
bit of the strip and stuff.

644
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.680
so it's not all glamorous.

645
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.320
It's more work than it is glamour.

646
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320
I'd love to have a night here.

647
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.520
no training. just come here and
experience it properly.

648
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.000
It'd be class.

649
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.280
Vegas must be a hard place
to do a training camp

650
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.680
because you're seeing everything
that you could be doing

651
00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.280
if you were on a holiday

652
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.800
and the lads need to live like
monks when they're in camp.

653
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.560
I love it here.
My wife's from here -

654
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.120
it's why we got the place.

655
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.760
I didn't realise how much
I kind of needed this place.

656
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.720
you know...the anonymity.

657
00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.560
and I think Josh has
enjoyed that as well.

658
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.280
I've known Martin
now for about six years.

659
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.360
He's Scotland's
sweetheart. you know?

660
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.280
Everyone loves him in Scotland
and he's a real cool guy.

661
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.080
He's been to a lot of my
fights and he supports me.

662
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.600
I don't know about you. but I'm
freezing my tits off here.

663
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.800
This is like being
back in Scotland. man.

664
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.640
They've went soft. Losing weight.
Had that nice weather.

665
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.040
There you go. son.
No. I'm all right!

666
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.800
He's a fucking madman.

667
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.080
He's a great lad.

668
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.960
loyal to his family. loyal to his
pals. but he is a headcase.

669
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.800
Erm... But I think you've got to
have that to be a top level...

670
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.480
You've got to have something...

671
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.160
That killer instinct.  You've got
to have a bit of danger about you.

672
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.080
you've got to have
something. that adrenaline.

673
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.240
because you always...  Aye. very nice
words. Martin. Thanks very much.

674
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.200
Speaking very nicely to me!

675
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.720
Look. the boy's got a great heart

676
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.560
but he is a bit of a madman. you
know. and I think he's a character.

677
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.240
and I think. in sport.
people do respond to that.

678
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.040
They respond to people
that speak their mind.

679
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.000
Sometimes I'll say things

680
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.800
and I don't realise
what I'm saying can be huge.

681
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.280
I forget about the effect
it can have on other people

682
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.920
because I don't see
myself as a celebrity.

683
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.120
and I don't see myself
as anything special.

684
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.680
I think he needs to realise now.
where he's at in his career.

685
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.680
anything he says is going
to be under a microscope.

686
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.320
Anything. any opinion he's got.
anything he's ever done.

687
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.640
people are going to look at
that and. if they can use it.

688
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.520
it will be used to batter you over
the head

689
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.200
because there's always people
that want to see you fail.

690
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.520
I sort of wear my
heart on my sleeve.

691
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.200
I'm an honest person and maybe
say some stupid things every now

692
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.640
and again. but it's never
with bad intentions.

693
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.160
I don't believe in
putting on a persona.

694
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.040
If you put on a persona.
you've got to maintain an image.

695
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.080
I'm just myself. I'm just one of the
best in the world at what he does

696
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.640
and lives for it. and
dedicates himself to his craft.

697
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.000
I'm just a...down to Earth. working
class lad at the end of the day.

698
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.880
We're off on our way to church.

699
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.360
Sunday ritual. wherever we go.

700
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.520
for training camps.

701
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.200
So...it'll be eventful.

702
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.720
It's hard to explain.

703
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.760
I don't categorise myself in being
a Christian or being a Muslim.

704
00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.160
I just feel like I have my
own relationship with God.

705
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.400
I always go to...to the church.
while I'm away on training camp

706
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.680
especially. and become
good friends with a pastor.

707
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.400
So the boys come along with me
and they seem to enjoy it as well.

708
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.880
People watching from Australia.

709
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.000
they're watching from all around the
world. maybe even from Scotland.

710
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.360
or from England. my friend.
the great trainer. Ben Davidson.

711
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.800
Josh Taylor. I saw Lee again.
a tremendous boxer.

712
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.320
But I'm going to ask everybody to
stretch their hands

713
00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.720
to them right now.

714
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.000
And I want you just to begin
to pray for these four men

715
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.200
who came to church.
I want you to pray that.

716
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.840
as they fly back to
England and to Scotland.

717
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.720
that they're going to feel
the love of a church.

718
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.400
And I want to just tell
you something.

719
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.680
You're just not normal guys.
You have a huge. huge destiny.

720
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.960
And they're warriors.

721
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.040
I want to be more like
them when I grow up.

722
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.280
I want to be more
like them in my future.

723
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.920
I want to be a warrior for God.

724
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.280
Can everybody pray
as we sing this song?

725
00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.400
He just said he sees things in me.

726
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.040
he sees the word "inspiration"
and that over me.

727
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.240
and to help people and drive people
on and helping people in the future

728
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.160
and that. I swear. as soon as
the prayer was almost finished.

729
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.320
I felt like a warm sensation
going through my body.

730
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.280
like the presence of... It's mad.

731
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.800
but I definitely
100% felt something.

732
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.440
It can't hurt to have God and
a bit of faith in your corner.

733
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.080
as well. you know?

734
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.120
Feet.

735
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.800
That back leg.

736
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.000
Time. Good stuff. boys.

737
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.680
Ah. fucking hell. man.

738
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.000
I don't think I can ever
remember the sparring

739
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.760
being this bad for this long.

740
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.960
I feel like I'm just
like not at the races.

741
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.440
I can see it coming.
I can see what to do.

742
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.920
but my body can't pull the trigger.

743
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.160
I feel like my mind is a
bit fucking...hmm. fuck.

744
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.800
Do you know what I mean?

745
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.400
It's doing my fucking head in.

746
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.600
Doing my head in. mate.

747
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.760
Fuck off.

748
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.800
Ah. fuck off!

749
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.120
Obviously. when you do
think about it. you do get

750
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.280
a little bit nervous because what's
at stake here in terms of.

751
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.920
I've got everything to lose.

752
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.880
Jack's got nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

753
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.160
So that little fear factor of

754
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.480
getting beat...is
keeping me on my toes.

755
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.560
I'm not scared or
anything like that.

756
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.160
but I just don't want to lose.
I want to win so much.

757
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.600
Back at my home arena. the Hydro.
where I've had most of my success.

758
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.600
both as an amateur
and a professional.

759
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.600
so I've had plenty of
great nights at Hydro.

760
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.640
Get a wee feeling of nerves
when you look at it.

761
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.240
HE GRUNTS

762
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.600
It's been a long time
coming. this fight.

763
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.880
Everyone's been frustrated for the
last two years.

764
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.160
not being able to
get out. see family.

765
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.960
do this. do that. go
on holidays. socialise.

766
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.000
I'm delighted that it's
back to full capacity.

767
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.560
It's a good feeling for me to be
back boxing in front of crowds.

768
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.000
CHEERING

769
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.600
It feels like I've been away
forever and. yeah. I can't wait.

770
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.880
Josh...

771
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.880
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

772
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.400
Josh.

773
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.840
Top man. brother. All the best.
Legend. bro!

774
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.880
Aw. wait!

775
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.520
Josh is the one with
everything to lose.

776
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.440
so that can put you in a
very dangerous position.

777
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.640
And also. the homecoming. you know
he's going to want to put on a show.

778
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.720
When you're at home. all
the pressure's on you.

779
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.080
Everybody's expecting
Josh Taylor to win

780
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.440
and everybody's expecting
a great performance.

781
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.080
And if he doesn't deliver that.

782
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.080
I know Josh himself will
think it's a let down.

783
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.520
It'll be a dangerous fight.

784
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.200
Jack. it's like getting blood
out of a stone with him.

785
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.880
He doesn't say much. but I'm just
going to tell him tomorrow that.

786
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.800
you know. it's game on now.

787
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.640
It's game on now and he
better be ready for a fight.

788
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.200
From Lancashire. England.

789
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.920
Jack "El Gato" Catterall.

790
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.400
Jack Catterall. what
he does in the gym.

791
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.680
no-one's seen it yet
on a fight night.

792
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.240
He's unbelievable
to watch in the gym.

793
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.120
He's a special. special fighter.

794
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.280
You've got the rivalry between
the two fighters.

795
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.680
between the two countries.
Scotland and England.

796
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.640
which has always
been a massive rivalry.

797
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.160
and it's going to be really
passionate in there.

798
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.240
And I think there's always a chance
that Josh could maybe just get

799
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.960
caught up in that a little bit
too much and see red.

800
00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.200
This is it now. boy.  It's..  This is
it. now. Everything.  It's happening.

801
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.480
You're going to get a fucking
pasting.  Yeah? We'll see.

802
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.760
Fucking pasting. mate.  All right.

803
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.320
Fighters. for the most.
are always a wee bit...

804
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.360
..most of them have a screw loose
and Josh certainly has that.

805
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.360
And. obviously. the nickname
Hank from My. Myself and Irene.

806
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.960
First of all. he looks like him.

807
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.920
He used to have
these stupid haircuts

808
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.920
that were a bit like Hank's.

809
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.680
We can shake hands after.
but right now it's...

810
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.280
We're going to punch each
other's heads in and that's it.

811
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.520
Final word...  Couldn't punch
a phone number in. ya cunt.

812
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.800
He has this almost split personality

813
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.080
where. one minute. he's nice
and the next minute he's not.

814
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.120
and it's normally he's not nice
when it gets around fighting.

815
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.880
I was a bit raging with myself
I dropped that C-bomb. like?

816
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.680
Was you?  Aye. I was like. "Ah.
fuck."

817
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.120
Either your mum or Danielle.
it's like their heart broke.

818
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.440
and they went. "Urgh!"

819
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.440
LAUGHTER

820
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.640
It would have been...
It would have been my da'.

821
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.720
Would it? It would have been my
da' because my da' always goes.

822
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.080
"Stop fucking swearing
in interviews. man."

823
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.640
I don't get emotionally attached.

824
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.080
I know it looks like it
on fight week sometimes.

825
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.640
with my actions. but
that's just me ready to go.

826
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.200
You ready?

827
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.440
I'm getting to that
frame of mind now

828
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.760
where I don't want to see him.
I don't want to talk to him.

829
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.480
I want to punch him in the face

830
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.520
for the last 17. 18 weeks
he's put me through.

831
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.000
Ah!

832
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.720
He's trying to prevent me
from feeding my family.

833
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.600
putting food on the
table later on in life.

834
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.520
This is what I'm doing this
for. is to. after boxing.

835
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.760
have a good life and
provide for a family

836
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.720
and he's standing in the way of it.

837
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.280
you know. and he's coming
here to try and knock me out

838
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.640
and hurt me. so I don't want
to be friends with him.

839
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.320
IMITATES BORAT: Not!

840
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.760
Having said that. as soon
as a final bell goes.

841
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.040
maybe go for a pint together.
you know.

842
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.080
and then we can be maybe amicable.

843
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.120
But. right now. don't want
anything to do with him.

844
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.280
The best thing I've ever heard
anybody say about boxing.

845
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.520
I don't know who it was.
but it rings true for me

846
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.720
is that boxing is the sport
to which all other sports aspire.

847
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.320
That's beautiful.

848
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.320
LAUGHTER

849
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.840
Every kind of cliche in sport. every
kind of saying and phrase in sport.

850
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.200
it all comes from boxing.

851
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.280
It's sport kind of concentrated.

852
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.080
at its most intense
and its most focused.

853
00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.480
I worked in Meadowbank Sports
Centre.

854
00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.720
I remember. on his first
bout up at Meadowbank.

855
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.120
he was on the
small hall at the time.

856
00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.160
I was like. "Oh. my God."

857
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.760
I was so nervous.

858
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.000
You all right?  You all right?

859
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.840
And I remember one of
my managers saying.

860
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.720
"He's going to fill the big
hall in a few years' time."

861
00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.920
but I never. ever thought

862
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.960
that that would be what
his career would be.

863
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.440
Oh. my God.  What?  I ate that fart.

864
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.240
I don't know what I
thought he would be.

865
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.600
work in Asda maybe. I don't know!

866
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.840
Maybe that would have been better -

867
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.560
it would have been easier.

868
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.440
Oh. let's do it!

869
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.640
INDISTINCT

870
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.400
SHOUTING

871
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.880
CHEERING

872
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:13.920
Obviously you've got that feeling
in your stomach. like. that knot.

873
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.760
What's going to happen?
What's going to be the outcome?

874
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.600
Is he going to be
all right in there?

875
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.240
What about if something...?

876
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.440
What if he was to get injured?

877
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.360
As long as Josh goes into that ring.

878
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.160
but comes out the same Josh
as he went in the ring -

879
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.000
that's what I kind
of panic about as well.

880
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.040
SHOUTING

881
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.520
Josh Taylor!  Josh Taylor!  Go on!

882
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.440
The whole country
is absolutely buzzing.

883
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.200
You can feel it in the hotels -
everywhere you go. it's just...

884
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.720
The atmosphere is amazing
and Josh deserves this.

885
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.480
He deserves this homecoming.
He deserves this crowd.

886
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.320
It's going to be electric.

887
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.160
SINGING FLOWER OF SCOTLAND

888
00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:00.880
# And sent him homeward
tae think again... #

889
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.400
Ah. ya bastard.

890
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.360
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

891
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.920
Josh. when you're ready. sir.  Yeah.

892
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.840
Let's go. boys!

893
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:23.800
Ladies and gentlemen.
the time has come!

894
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:30.760
The Undisputed Super Lightweight
Championship of the World.

895
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.440
Glasgow. let me hear you!

896
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.640
CHEERING

897
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.680
I think the Scottish are just
intense people

898
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.720
and they're known to have that
fighting spirit.

899
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.080
and that fighting heart.

900
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.800
It's about pride -
it's about what that stands for.

901
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.160
It's about reputation. knowing
that. when he goes to battle.

902
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.320
all these people
are supporting him

903
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.200
and he feels he's got a
responsibility to...

904
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.360
to do them proud.

905
00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.920
Scotland's Braveheart tackles
England's mandatory challenger.

906
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.680
CHANTING

907
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.360
It's Rocky. man. you know what I
mean? You're in there

908
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.760
fighting for a country when
you've got that backing.

909
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.120
You've got everybody
going to the Hydro. you know?

910
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.120
You're sort of carrying
the hopes of a nation.

911
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.200
I mean. that's pressure
I couldn't imagine.

912
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.160
What about this atmosphere?

913
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.040
It's the last sort
of gladiator sport.

914
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.120
You've got guys and women in there

915
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.440
battering the life
out of each other.

916
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.200
And you've got all these people.

917
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.040
you're kind of living their dreams
for them. and you cannot switch off.

918
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.040
Jack Catterall is
boxing magnificently.

919
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.680
The crowd right here.
at the Hydro...

920
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.600
Oh. good shot from Catterall.

921
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.360
Getting nailed here.

922
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.280
He's losing the boxing match.

923
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.760
And he floors Taylor.
here. in the 8th round!

924
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.400
What about that?!

925
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.360
Well. this is extraordinary!

926
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.440
My father was a miner

927
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.920
and his grandfathers was miners.

928
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.560
and their fathers were miners

929
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.960
and they were brought up
to be hard in they days.

930
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.160
Josh is like a kind of throwback.

931
00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.680
He was brought up the same way.

932
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.840
Years ago. the old miners. you
either went to the pub

933
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.680
or you went to the gym. And his
grandfather boxed.

934
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.040
my father boxed.

935
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.640
all the miners boxed. because
that's all they had to do

936
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.400
when they came
home from their work.

937
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.360
So they were all hardy. hardy men

938
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.680
and Josh is just the same.

939
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.640
You didn't need to teach him it -
it was just natural.

940
00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.160
He's really biting down on that
gumshield. Josh Taylor.

941
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.240
THEY CHANT FLOWER OF SCOTLAND

942
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.000
Crowd roaring on.

943
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.680
Referee. come on!

944
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.040
I think there's going to be a
point off for Jack Catterall.

945
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.440
so that's interesting.

946
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.560
Some of these rounds
tough to score.

947
00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.200
Good shot from Taylor.

948
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.160
BELL DINGS

949
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.760

CROWD CHEERS

972
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.240
..Josh Taylor!

973
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.440
Yass! Come on!

974
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.640
Yo! We don't give a fuck!

975
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.480
That is bullshit.

976
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.680
Everybody knows who the
winner was - Jack Catterall.

977
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.440
Jack Catterall boxed
his fucking head off.

978
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.080
Three rounds. He put him on his
backside as well.  And Josh won.

979
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.000
Oh. my God.

980
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.720
I was really. really...

981
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.480
See when he said a split decision...

982
00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.520
Oh-ho-ho!

983
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.560
Yeah.

984
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.440
When you're in survival mode
for the last four or five rounds.

985
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.800
judges don't like it
when you're the challenger.

986
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.040
He put a lot of pressure on himself.
though. Josh. A lot of pressure.

987
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.840
Very hard.

988
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.880
HE SIGHS

989
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.920
Pissed off.

990
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.280
I know that I'm 100 times
better than that.

991
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.200
I just felt like a shadow of myself
in the fight. you know.

992
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:41.280
in terms of reactions and being up
for it and being motivated to win.

993
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.800
I don't know what it was.
but I just felt very frustrated

994
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.720
with the performance that I put on.

995
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.600
After we got back to the post-fight
press conference.

996
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.240
people were sort of
looking sort of surprised

997
00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.800
that I thought I'd won.

998
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.880
but it wasn't until
the day after the fight

999
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.880
and I turned my phone back on and it
was just full of abuse.

1000
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.160
hateful messages. and then
Danielle started getting it

1001
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.280
and my little sister
started getting it.

1002
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.280
I was getting comments
underneath a picture

1003
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.600
that I'd put up the night
before of me in my outfit

1004
00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.880
and one guy had said that
I belonged in the ground.

1005
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.680
which wasn't that bad.

1006
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.360
But then. in my
private messages. that was.

1007
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.760
"You're going
to get your throat slit.

1008
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.960
"If I ever see you.
you're going to get stabbed.

1009
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.440
"you know. stuff like that."

1010
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.240
I can remember lying in bed
crying sometimes. you know.

1011
00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.920
and thinking.
"I can't believe people

1012
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.240
"are actually saying this to me."

1013
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.680
How can you say that
to someone's family?

1014
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.400
You know. it's meant to be
a sport at the end of the day.

1015
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.200
It's not anything
to do with my family.

1016
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.200
It's nothing to do with me.

1017
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.720
I went there and did my job.
and that should be the end of it.

1018
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.400
It's three weeks now.

1019
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.000
I've had the chance to watch
it back like four times.

1020
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.320
You know. it's a close fight.
It's a very close fight.

1021
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.680
It could have went either way.

1022
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.120
I felt that. if it had went to Jack
by one or two points. that's fine.

1023
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.200
you know? I wouldn't have argued.
DOG BARKS

1024
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.880
But I felt that I did enough.
just. to win the fight.

1025
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.960
and a lot of it's
done to perception.

1026
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.040
from that angle or whatever.
you know.

1027
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.840
and so the judges saw what they saw

1028
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.160
and they're very
well-respected judges.

1029
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:34.200
And it's not my...my
fault that they gave me the win.

1030
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.080
Come on. let's go.

1031
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.360
He had one-off night and
everyone's jumped on the bandwagon

1032
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.680
about how he's a terrible boxer.

1033
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.400
and how he's got no class.

1034
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.200
how he's terrible for the sport

1035
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.560
and stuff like that.

1036
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.320
You don't know him.

1037
00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.880
He's dedicated he's life. he's
dedicated everything to this sport.

1038
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.480
and that's what
people are forgetting.

1039
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.400
Danielle's my rock. you know?

1040
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.280
She's there for me no matter what.
you know?

1041
00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.320
The good. the bad and the ugly.

1042
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.040
We've had a few of these moments

1043
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.200
and she's my everything.
she's my world.

1044
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.720
Josh now needs to move up
to a different weight class.

1045
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.960
You know. he's done
everything at 140.

1046
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.640
He's wanting to be a world champion
at welterweight. you know?

1047
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.640
He's wanting to chase more dreams.

1048
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.080
I can now go ahead and chase the
big goals and the big fights.

1049
00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.280
I've got two or three years left.

1050
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.800
I want to become a two-weight
world champion.

1051
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.440
which the fire's fully
burning for me to do.

1052
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.640
But there's also a fire burning
there now to have the rematch

1053
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.520
with Jack. and fight him again
and prove the doubters wrong.

1054
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:47.320
Jack Catterall boxed
his fucking head off.

1055
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.800
I've got a lot of doubters.

1056
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.520
but I've proved people
wrong my whole career...

1057
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.480
A big left hand drops Jose Ramirez!

1058
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.200
..and I plan on keeping to do it.

1059
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.440
I think he would rather
die than lose at anything.

1060
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:06.440
He's going to fill the big
hall in a few years' time.

1061
00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.960
Boxing is the truth.

1062
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.560
Josh is like a kind of throwback.

1063
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.640
There's definitely something deep
in me that comes from both sides

1064
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.400
of my family. of tough
working class fighting men

1065
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.400
and that's what I want
to be remembered as.

1066
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.240
just a fighter that wasn't
afraid to take on all challenges

1067
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.400
and allcomers and give it his all.
