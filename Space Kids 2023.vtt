3
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.202
The Earthers
came to Kepler

4
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:35.869
in search
of a special plant

5
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.871
that contained
a powerful energy.

6
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.873
but the Earthers were greedy
and overharvested it.

7
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.376
leaving Kepler
a deserted wasteland.

8
00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.878
But there was
one human who felt guilty.

9
00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.047
He hid the last seed
from the mother tree

10
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.482
in a secret place.

11
00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:50.684
No one
has seen him since

12
00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:53.020
and without him
to pilot the ship.

13
00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:56.790
the remaining crew
did not make it back to Earth.

14
00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:02.630
Hurry up.
You. search over there.

15
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.202
Search everywhere!
Luis Baba commands it.

16
00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:10.304
Dig 13 feet down
if you have to.

17
00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.706
-Yes. sir.
- Luis Baba?

18
00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.752
Axel. where are we going?

19
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.420
To find Kar-Lalo.

20
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.656
Can you figure out
where it is?

21
00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.391
No. but I will find it.

22
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.605
Axel. stop!

23
00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.039
Darn.
How did he find us?

24
00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:48.709
Why is Papa Qi
after us?

25
00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.278
Come back with me!

26
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.713
There is no Kunta.
There is no Kar-Lalo.

27
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.616
You're wrong!
It's written in the book.

28
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.051
Crazy kid.

29
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.189
Misleading Jono like that.

30
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.900
See ya!

31
00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:19.307
What was that?

32
00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:24.077
Axel. I'll tell you
one more time.

33
00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:27.281
Don't believe anything
in this silly book.

34
00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:29.250
It's all just nonsense.

35
00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:32.486
There's no Kunta.
there's no Luis Baba.

36
00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:34.322
Just stop dreaming.

37
00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:36.490
I mean it!
You too. Jono.

38
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.330
Hey. give it!
You're not my dad.

39
00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:45.933
You.

40
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.737
Go ahead and find
your stupid Kar-Lalo.

41
00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:52.673
- Go on then!
- Papa. stop!

42
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.242
Stop!

43
00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:00.848
Axel! Papa!

44
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.484
- Gaga.
- You can't believe that.

45
00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.953
You were a colonel
in the Kepler army.

46
00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.989
but now you're just
a-- a giant coward!

47
00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.858
Silence!

48
00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.134
Gaga.

49
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.141
I don't want
to be like you.

50
00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:30.611
Nothing but a coward!

51
00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:35.849
Oh.

52
00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:51.565
Putron.

53
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.804
I'm so sorry
for all this.

54
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.975
It's always been
my wish

55
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.078
that Gaga would grow up
brave and strong.

56
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.814
but as she's grown.

57
00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:10.351
I've become very worried
and afraid of so much.

58
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.322
She says
that I'm a coward.

59
00:04:14.422 --> 00:04:16.590
I guess she's right.

60
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.093
You know what
I'm most scared of?

61
00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:24.765
Her growing up to be too brave.

62
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.069
Ah.

63
00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.217
Oh!

64
00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:55.295
But I don't blame them.

65
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.765
They're just too young

66
00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:01.469
to know how dangerous
true bravery can be.

67
00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:06.474
It's time to let them
go explore the world.

68
00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.778
Please take
good care of them. Putron.

69
00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:16.384
Axel!

70
00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:19.953
- Axel. so you've decided?
- Of course!

71
00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.456
That's great!
Come on. let's go.

72
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.658
Wait up.
What are you doing?

73
00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.494
Finding Kar-Lalo?

74
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.930
Uh. you're kidding. right?
Stay here with Papa Qi.

75
00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.766
Leave the Kar-Lalo search
to Axel.

76
00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:44.678
Papa wants
to keep me safe.

77
00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:47.815
But still.
I'm no longer a kid.

78
00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.182
I must show him that.

79
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.184
Stay where you're safe.

80
00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:54.422
If you don't want me.

81
00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.323
fine. I'll just
go on my own.

82
00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:59.026
All right. fine.

83
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.961
Come if you want.

84
00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.664
Wake up. Jono!

85
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.270
Aren't we gonna
test out my car?

86
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.473
Hey. Gaga. check it out.

87
00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.007
Isn't my piggy car awesome?

88
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:15.976
It's got four wheels
and everything. look!

89
00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:18.946
Let's go!

90
00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.551
Gaga. come up.

91
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.488
Hey. what are you waiting for?

92
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.056
Come on.

93
00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.796
Regret coming already?

94
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.798
Putron. let's ride!

95
00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:47.475
Papa. I'll be back.

96
00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.150
Hurry.

97
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:01.555
They may think
I'm just a coward.

98
00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.424
but they never saw what
I could do when I was young.

99
00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.496
Let's go.
Follow them.

100
00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:17.170
I thought this was
a test drive.

101
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.839

Oh. so

124
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.335
this is Luis Baba's Kar-Lalo
seed that never sprouts.

125
00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:31.639
Let me take care of it.

126
00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:02.335
Even an unsprouted Kar-Lalo seed

127
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.438
can yield
a great deal of super energy

128
00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.574
and with more super energy.

129
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:10.610
I can activate
my vector engines.

130
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.713
Beginning energy test.

131
00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:24.291
Go find enough Kar-Lalo
to fill all my energy rods.

132
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.230
My Kar-Lalo seed was stolen.

133
00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:33.133
These shameless enemies
are everywhere.

134
00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:36.970
Oh. this can't get out.

135
00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:40.407
Everyone needs to believe
I still have the seed.

136
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.442
Oh!

137
00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:43.811
My Lord.

138
00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:46.980
we must find
a truly brave warrior

139
00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.648
in this year's
Birdy Tournament.

140
00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:51.719
one strong enough
to retrieve the seed.

141
00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:53.721
Come in.

142
00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:56.990
My Lord.

143
00:10:57.124 --> 00:11:00.493
I've made a special potion
to help you rest.

144
00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:02.896
You'll sleep like a baby.

145
00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:08.635
Oh. Vance. no one
but you understands me.

146
00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:10.938
Don't forget my Lord.
in the morning

147
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.806
you have to be
at the Birdy Tournament.

148
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.942
I have to have
a good night's sleep.

149
00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.510
- Leave me alone!
- Oh. but. my Lord.

150
00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:21.581
uh. the Sisyphy Volcano
was preparing to erupt.

151
00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:26.186
You can be
my representative

152
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.857
at the tournament tomorrow
with Dr. Vance.

153
00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:36.797
Warriors have
gathered from all over Kepler.

154
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.267
Meet Air Bomber.
Alpha Power Fan.

155
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:44.004
Brutal Rocket.
and Lethal Engine!

156
00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.673
They'll race through
the dangerous valley course

157
00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:50.143
and compete to be
this year's Birdy King!

158
00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.813
- Air Bomb!
- Alpha Power Fan!

159
00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.782
- Brutal Rocket!
- Lethal Engine!

160
00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:58.051
- All right!
- Referee Bird. clear the track.

161
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.520
The tournament's
about to begin.

162
00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:03.323
Everyone. stand by.

163
00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:12.132
Do you think Kar-Lalo
could be in the Burning City?

164
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.969
Well. if you're so smart.
do you know how to get us there?

165
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:19.306
Can we just get out
of this valley first?

166
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.241
Forget your map.
I'll get us out.

167
00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:28.381
- Yeah. big deal.
- Are you gonna fly as well?

168
00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.420
Jono. keep up!

169
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.830
I'd better stay
in my pig car.

170
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.731
See my sweet moves?

171
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.733
You here
to show off or find a path?

172
00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:47.901
To show off. duh.

173
00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:50.270
Oh. huh?

174
00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.506
Hey. watch out!
Gaga. you okay?

175
00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:57.277
Stop it!

176
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.879
You don't own the air.

177
00:12:59.012 --> 00:13:00.914
- Just back off!
-Axel. come back!

178
00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:16.463
You're too slow
to keep up with me!

179
00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:47.995
Come on!

180
00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.601
Axel. I can't see you!

181
00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:55.936
Wait for me!

182
00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:27.000
Axel!

183
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.477
Woohoo!

184
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.112
We're here
to look for Kar-Lalo.

185
00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.880
not for trouble!

186
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.684
Axel!

187
00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.053
Guys. run!

188
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.620
Gaga!

189
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.822
Who are these people?

190
00:14:49.957 --> 00:14:52.192
Axel!

191
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.860
Be careful!

192
00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.703
Who's gonna be
the lucky guy this year?

193
00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.372
Not us anyway.

194
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.508
Where did
those guys come from?

195
00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.378
Interesting.

196
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.246
The cobra device.

197
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.184
I've never seen such
quick responsive movement.

198
00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:20.253
Dr. Vance. I don't know
what you're talking about.

199
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.156
but if we mess this up.
both of us are doomed.

200
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.861
Whoa. we're already
in the final zone.

201
00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:31.198
Time to bug out.

202
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.202
I'm caught in an updraft.

203
00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:38.438
I can't control it! Ah!

204
00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:43.610
My engine's dead.
I'm going down!

205
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.412
Well. these guys
are getting better

206
00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:48.215
at faking disasters.
that's for sure.

207
00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:49.849
At this rate.
we'll end up

208
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.419
without a Birdy King
again this year.

209
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.525
All players
into the final zone!

210
00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.530
Gaga. careful.

211
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.864
Stay away from them.

212
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.866
Sorry!

213
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.202
Good luck to you guys.

214
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.603
Gaga!

215
00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:12.272
Prepare the bird.

216
00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:14.941
Get in there.

217
00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:17.744
Fire the champion bird.

218
00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:23.716
Help me!

219
00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.586
Help me!

220
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.594
The world's worst tournament

221
00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:37.664
because no one
wants to win it.

222
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.133
If there isn't a winner.

223
00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:42.602
I'll launch all of you
into the volcano!

224
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.180
.

225
00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:55.482
- That poor bird.
-I'll save it.

226
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.526
Yes. he's almost there.

227
00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:08.661
Would you look at that?

228
00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:11.531
The tournament's
interesting this year.

229
00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.971
Oh. help me!

230
00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:20.973
Got him. catch!

231
00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:23.042
Oh. my God.

232
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.316
- Oh. my goodness.
- Axel. I got it!

233
00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:31.218
I'm saved!

234
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.858
Easy as pie.

235
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:47.033
Axel. when you dove down
that way

236
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:50.737
like a flash whooshing by...

237
00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.905
...that was awesome!

238
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:57.177
Axel is amazing.
You're the best.

239
00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.347
It's nothing.
just saving a bird.

240
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.914
Piece of cake.

241
00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:04.684
Congratulations. Birdy King.

242
00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:07.086

your bravery.

243

Everyone hail
this year's Birdy King.

244
00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.563
What is a Birdy King?

245
00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.865
Birdy King.

246
00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:20.833
That is one silly name.

247
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.536
It's not that funny!
You're just jealous.

248
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.939
Captain. this just
isn't right.

249
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.509
That girl
didn't save the champion bird.

250
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.010
Oh. it's right all right.

251
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.281
The rule is whoever
catches the champion bird

252
00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:37.550
is the one
who becomes Birdy King.

253
00:18:37.684 --> 00:18:39.952

338
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.275
Fresh air? All right.

339
00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:51.478

wants some fresh air.

340
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.746
let's get her some fresh air.

341
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.483
-Axel!
- You are the Birdy King now.

00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:58.418
You have to try to get the seed.

343
00:21:58.551 --> 00:22:00.319
- If you should fail--
-Let me go!

344
00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:01.921
You won't leave here alive.

345
00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:03.656
- I don't think so.
-Arrest them!

346
00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:07.394

359
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.149
Huh? Putron!

360
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.653
Who are you?

361
00:23:06.786 --> 00:23:09.055
Please call me Dr. Vance.

362
00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:13.159
Luis Baba's thugs
captured your friend.

363
00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:15.061
What? She's been caught?

364
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.664
Hurry up. Jono.

365
00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:19.398
Let's save Gaga. Putron!

366
00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.472
Hang on.

367
00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:27.206
Let's not rush it.

368
00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:30.076
You are no match for Luis Baba.

369
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:34.213
But if you really
want to save her. I can help.

370
00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:37.517
But first. we'll need a plan.

371
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.186
Don't you work for Luis Baba?

372
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:46.158
I work for myself. 'kay?

373
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.695
Now let's come up
with that plan.

374
00:23:56.035 --> 00:23:58.370
Do you know
how to defeat an enemy

375
00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:02.441
that's much stronger
than you are. my boy?

376
00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:03.843
Ah. huh?

377
00:24:06.112 --> 00:24:07.446
Timing.

378
00:24:08.414 --> 00:24:10.950
Axel. wait for me.

379
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:13.219
I'm coming.

380
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:19.759
The biggest obstacle
for galactic space travel

381
00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:22.929
is the enormous scale
of distance in time and space.

382
00:24:23.062 --> 00:24:25.364
Artificial
wormhole test initiated.

383
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:28.134
Even going faster
than the speed of light

384
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.136
doesn't solve this problem.

385
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:33.472
However.
reversing this planet's

386
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.076
gravitational force
will bend the magnetic fields

387
00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:41.614
around it. creating
a gravitational whirlpool.

388
00:24:42.615 --> 00:24:45.552
Which. when bombarded
with super energy.

389
00:24:45.652 --> 00:24:48.921
will form a stable
time space wormhole.

390
00:24:49.055 --> 00:24:50.890
through which
you can instantly travel

391
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.226
to another planet
across the universe.

392
00:24:58.665 --> 00:25:01.000
This galactic energy bridge

393
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:03.069
will be my ticket home.

394
00:25:05.572 --> 00:25:08.507
Go spy
on the Burning City closely.

395
00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:12.912
Report back to me the second
Luis Baba finds Kar-Lalo.

396
00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:24.591
We stand here
in the name of all gods

397
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:27.259
to give the Birdy King

398
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.195
great power and light.

399
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.999
guiding her
through plight and danger.

400
00:25:33.132 --> 00:25:34.601
Repelling the curse

401
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:37.503
with God's almighty fire

402
00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:41.040
and blessing her
with an immortal life!

403
00:25:45.945 --> 00:25:47.680
Jono. you stay below.

404
00:25:47.814 --> 00:25:49.315
Copy that.

405
00:25:49.448 --> 00:25:51.483
We don't have much time.

406
00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:53.653
Putron. I'll save Gaga.

407
00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:55.655
You go find Papa Qi.

408
00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:14.073
On your feet.
Listen well. everyone.

409
00:26:14.206 --> 00:26:16.508
Here is the new Birdy King.

410
00:26:16.643 --> 00:26:19.478
She is the hope
of the Burning City.

411
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.347
You behave!

412
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.384
-Back off!
- The Sisyphy volcano is awake.

413
00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:29.221
The gods are challenging
the new Birdy King

414
00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:33.525
to go and retrieve
the holy seed.

415
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.028
Let us. everyone.

416
00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:38.597
pray for her.

417
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:43.936
The gods
have chosen a brave warrior

418
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.005
to face the fire

419
00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:49.375
and gain the holy seed for us!

420
00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:55.181
Axel.
you only have one chance.

421
00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:58.450
emember. timing is everything.R

422
00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:03.890
If you miss your moment.
you will surely both die.

423
00:27:06.926 --> 00:27:08.627
Aim the launcher.

424
00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:11.463
Stand ready.

425
00:27:11.898 --> 00:27:13.232
Fire!

426
00:27:19.772 --> 00:27:21.040
Gaga!

427
00:27:27.213 --> 00:27:28.114
Huh?

428
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:43.730
Whoa!

429
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.664
Gaga!

430
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:51.237
Gaga!

431
00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:54.673
Axel...

432
00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:41.020
Axel.

433
00:28:42.688 --> 00:28:44.490
I'm going to count to three

434
00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:46.558
and Axel will fly out.

435
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:49.228
- Stay right there!
- Take her away.

436
00:28:49.361 --> 00:28:50.562
Oh. my goodness.

437
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:13.920
Huh?

438
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:17.356
Huh? Ah. Kar-Lalo.

439
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.122
How is it possible?

440
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:52.458
The boy actually made it out.

441
00:29:54.861 --> 00:29:59.065
Nobody. nobody has ever
come out of the volcano alive!

442
00:29:59.198 --> 00:30:03.035
It's... impossible.

443
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:04.636
Impossible!

444
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:09.475
Throw all of them
into the volcano Sisyphy!

445
00:30:15.381 --> 00:30:16.448
Dr. Vance!

446
00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:21.320
Axel. no one's ever come back
from the volcano with a seed.

447
00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:23.489
All the others died trying.

448
00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.458
Uh. it's Luis Baba's
conspiracy to prove

449
00:30:26.592 --> 00:30:28.594
only he can beat
the fire dragon.

450
00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:31.163
Your success threatens that.

451
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.465
There's no way
he will let you live.

452
00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:35.834
- You follow me.
-Hey. green hair.

453
00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:41.773
Let's go.

454
00:30:41.908 --> 00:30:43.575
Jono. follow me.

455
00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.311
Me first.

456
00:31:10.636 --> 00:31:14.040
Stay close.
I know a safe place.

457
00:31:14.974 --> 00:31:17.376
Wait. I have to
return to the volcano.

458
00:31:17.543 --> 00:31:20.646
Say what?
Why would you do that?

459
00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:23.649
I think I found Kar-Lalo.

460
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.522
Did all that heat
melt your brain?

461
00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:32.224
Why don't you believe me?

462
00:31:32.358 --> 00:31:34.893
Those seeds
are coming from the volcano.

463
00:31:35.027 --> 00:31:36.662
There's Kar-Lalo inside it.

464
00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:39.465
Impossible!
Lava. yes.

465
00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:40.899
Lalo. no!

466
00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:43.369
Going in there
would mean certain death.

467
00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:45.504
We need to leave
the Burning City now.

468
00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.406
- But wait--
- It's too dangerous

469
00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:48.707
to leave now.

470
00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:52.478
so we'll just hide in here
for the night.

471
00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:54.413
Oh.

472
00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:04.590
My Lord!

473
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:07.759
It's all clear now.

474
00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:10.262
Dr. Vance is the one
who helped the prisoners escape.

475
00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.931
Even the little
green haired thief is gone.

476
00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.069
Vance?

477
00:32:17.203 --> 00:32:19.205
How dare that worm betray me?

478
00:32:19.705 --> 00:32:22.174
Bring all of them back.
dead or alive!

479
00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:23.909
- Yes. sir.
- Wait!

480
00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:26.012
Block off the volcano.

481
00:32:26.112 --> 00:32:28.580
Nobody's allowed
to get near it!

482
00:32:28.714 --> 00:32:32.351
- Open up!
-everywhere.

483
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:33.852
Where should we look. sir?

484
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:35.954
Everywhere. even if we have to

485
00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:37.523
tear down the whole city.

486
00:32:37.623 --> 00:32:39.091
They can't get away.

487
00:32:39.225 --> 00:32:41.627
Find anyone
who is wearing a turtle shell.

488
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.895
Find the traitor
in the turtle shell!

489
00:33:18.397 --> 00:33:20.099
Dr. Vance.

490
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:24.236
Do you believe
the story of Kunta?

491
00:33:25.137 --> 00:33:26.572
Story. huh?

492
00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:29.108
Believing in stories

493
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:30.842
is a luxury of the young.

494
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.612
Well. I believe it.

495
00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.181
I will find Kar-Lalo.

496
00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.517
Hmm. it's nice to be young.

497
00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:39.985
Hmm.

498
00:33:40.119 --> 00:33:43.922
Axel. how did you
get out of the volcano?

499
00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.170
Uh. that darn tank!

500
00:33:58.304 --> 00:34:00.172
Breaking down
when we really need it.

501
00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:03.975
Fix it. quick.

502
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.214
It's nearly morning.

503
00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:10.716
How far are we. Putron?

504
00:34:24.463 --> 00:34:27.233
Dr. Vance.
sorry that you can't stay

505
00:34:27.366 --> 00:34:29.868
in the Burning City
because of us.

506
00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:33.639
It's all right.
It wasn't my home anyway.

507
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.575
I had to leave eventually.

508
00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:42.748
It's been
so long since I left my home.

509
00:34:43.582 --> 00:34:47.753
Whenever I miss it.
I look up at the starry sky.

510
00:34:48.154 --> 00:34:51.357
Dr. Vance.
which star is your home?

511
00:34:52.391 --> 00:34:55.927
My world is full of water.

512
00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:58.764
It's covered in vast oceans.

513
00:34:59.198 --> 00:35:02.668
I would sit
on a rock by the sea

514
00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:05.537
at twilight listening

515
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:08.073
to the sound of waves

516
00:35:08.207 --> 00:35:09.941
breaking on the beach.

517
00:35:12.077 --> 00:35:13.712
Sounds beautiful.

518
00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:17.716
Not just beautiful.
it's magical.

519
00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:24.290
Just imagine if all this desert

520
00:35:24.423 --> 00:35:26.625
were as blue as the sky...

521
00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:30.962
with rolling waves
instead of dunes...

522
00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:35.267
waves caressing
the shore at your feet.

523
00:35:35.401 --> 00:35:36.802
Do you hear it?

524
00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:41.139
I can't hear anything.

525
00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:42.974
Listen with your heart.

526
00:35:46.812 --> 00:35:49.748
Ah. well. I can hear the wind.

527
00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:51.049
Shh.

528
00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.675
Doctor.

529
00:36:16.808 --> 00:36:19.077
It's working.
I can hear the waves.

530
00:36:38.664 --> 00:36:40.799
When I left home.

531
00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:43.702
my son was just your height...

532
00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:48.106
and he loved to put his head

533
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:51.009
onto my lap and sleep

534
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.712
to the song of the waves.

535
00:36:54.346 --> 00:36:55.714
Dr. Vance...

536
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.385
after I find the Kar-Lalo.

537
00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:02.120
you should come
and live with us.

538
00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:06.224
- All right.
- So. we have a deal?

539
00:37:09.295 --> 00:37:10.496
Deal.

540
00:38:10.689 --> 00:38:12.958
Putron.
is this the right way?

541
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.806
I've decided.
I'm going to the volcano now.

542
00:38:27.973 --> 00:38:30.308
- But--
- Don't try to stop me.

543
00:38:30.442 --> 00:38:32.444
My decision is final.

544
00:38:33.412 --> 00:38:36.214
Oh. Dr. Vance.
you can fly as well?

545
00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:39.818
It's been a while.
but it feels really good.

546
00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:41.753
Axel. you were right.

547
00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:44.656
If we time it
between the volcano's breaths.

548
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.791
we can make it.

549
00:38:49.895 --> 00:38:53.298
I. Jono. am always
very. very brave.

550
00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:55.467
I'm with you. Axel!

551
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:58.970
Boys. you aren't
cutting me out. right?

552
00:38:59.104 --> 00:39:00.639
You're not
leaving me behind.

553
00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:02.441
Then.
we're all together.

554
00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:04.676
Let's fly.

555
00:39:21.427 --> 00:39:23.028
When
the heat pushes up.

556
00:39:23.161 --> 00:39:26.698
it will create negative pressure
when it passes by a cave.

557
00:39:26.832 --> 00:39:30.802
Axel. you said you felt cool air
behind you in the tunnel.

558
00:39:30.936 --> 00:39:33.805
which means there must be
a hidden cavern.

559
00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:43.982
The volcano
is breathing.

560
00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:47.052
Find the cave
before the next eruption.

561
00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:48.887
Stay close.

562
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:52.558
Oh. my greasy goodness.

563
00:40:05.571 --> 00:40:07.573
The lava's
becoming active!

564
00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:13.078
Jono. careful!

565
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.182
The volcano's about to erupt!

566
00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:18.584
Where's the cave?

567
00:40:20.886 --> 00:40:21.987
Where?

568
00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:24.890
The lava's
boiling up!

569
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:34.432
It's there!

570
00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:36.001
I see it.

571
00:40:56.087 --> 00:40:59.224
Axel!

572
00:41:26.384 --> 00:41:28.920
Whoa. this is...

573
00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:33.659
- Is this real?
- ...Kar-Lalo?

574
00:41:57.583 --> 00:41:58.784
Wow!

575
00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:04.790
Kar-Lalo!

576
00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:07.258
I found you at last!

577
00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.360
Axel.
I'm sorry for doubting you.

578
00:42:09.494 --> 00:42:10.696
- It's all right.
- Hey. Axel.

579
00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:12.197
Can you pinch me. please?

580
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.999
Ow. it hurts!

581
00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:17.368
So this isn't a dream.

582
00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:19.671
Twenty years.

583
00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:22.140
I should've guessed it.

584
00:42:45.864 --> 00:42:47.498
Here I come!

585
00:42:50.168 --> 00:42:51.569
Jono. sit still.

586
00:42:51.703 --> 00:42:53.839
Whoa!

587
00:42:54.706 --> 00:42:58.409
Oh. my goodness!

588
00:43:07.152 --> 00:43:10.922
Oh. my goodness gracious.
So much water.

589
00:43:11.056 --> 00:43:13.591
Gaga. look.
this is water!

590
00:43:13.725 --> 00:43:14.993
I know!

591
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.901
Full of Kar-Lalo.

592
00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:25.403
Look. look!

593
00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:27.438
The Kar-Lalo seeds.

594
00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:30.208
- Thin Kar-Lalo.
- Thin Kar-Lalo.

595
00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.177
- Greener Kar-Lalo!
-Greener Kar-Lalo!

596
00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:35.013
And there is
ginger leaf Kar-Lalo.

597
00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:37.683
The book says
it's the sweetest kind.

598
00:43:37.783 --> 00:43:39.450
It makes me hungry.

599
00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:53.064
Look.
the Kar-Lalo mother tree!

600
00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:54.966
Magical.

601
00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:18.990
Wow. So many seeds.

602
00:44:19.124 --> 00:44:21.159
The mother tree
is spreading seeds.

603
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:23.995
There will be
lots of baby Kar-Lalos!

604
00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:32.003
What is this?

605
00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:38.443
"Hello.

606
00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:42.147
I'm glad
to be meeting you in this way.

607
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.282
My name is Kunta."

608
00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.084
The Kunta?

609
00:44:46.184 --> 00:44:49.187
Dr. Vance!
This is Kunta's journal!

610
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.356
Let me see.
Let me see.

611
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:54.659
"I am from Earth
in the Soul System.

612
00:44:54.793 --> 00:44:58.764
I work for
the MQ Super Energy Company.

613
00:44:58.864 --> 00:45:01.867
and I'm sorry
that our work here

614
00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:04.770
has brought
such devastation to Kepler.

615
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.473
All I can do. is hide
the Kar-Lalo mother tree here.

616
00:45:08.606 --> 00:45:11.109
and hope that one day.
Kepler can again

617
00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:13.344
be the paradise
that it was."

618
00:45:13.478 --> 00:45:14.846
This is from Kunta.

619
00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.215
This is where
Kunta hid Kar-Lalo.

620
00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:19.050
"When you read
these words.

621
00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:22.888
this cavern will have grown
into a great oasis.

622
00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:27.058
I believe you will come through
the burning flames one day.

623
00:45:27.192 --> 00:45:29.694
and bring Kar-Lalo
back to the surface."

624
00:45:29.828 --> 00:45:31.162
My goodness!

625
00:45:31.296 --> 00:45:33.564
"Come through
the burning flames one day?"

626
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:35.400
That's so awesome!

627
00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:39.237
"The square stone at your feet
is the key to the land above."

628
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.046
It's opening!

629
00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:38.596
The seeds
are flying out.

630
00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:08.159
Holy moly. that was
one seriously crazy dream.

631
00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:09.995
Ah!

632
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:13.098
Good heavens!
What happened?

633
00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:18.970
Wait. who is that guy?

634
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.841
Luis Baba?

635
00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:26.344
But isn't he an Earther?

636
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:36.087
What on Kepler
is going on?

637
00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:37.688
Don't be afraid.

638
00:47:37.822 --> 00:47:39.457
I have become
one of you.

639
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.160
and I have a feeling

640
00:47:42.293 --> 00:47:45.263
Kar-Lalo
is gonna be coming up.

641
00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:49.467
Kar-Lalo!
The Kar-Lalo is growing!

642
00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:52.170
Look. look!

643
00:47:52.437 --> 00:47:53.538
Look at it.

644
00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.474
Yeah. yeah. yeah!
You see that?

645
00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:59.710
It's like I said.
when you all obey me.

646
00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.513
Kar-Lalo will finally
blossom again.

647
00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:05.483
The fire dragon blesses me

648
00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.551
with this power.

649
00:48:06.684 --> 00:48:08.153
I revive
the Burning City.

650
00:48:08.286 --> 00:48:10.121
I promised
and I delivered.

651
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.889
Why is it you again?

652
00:48:12.023 --> 00:48:13.959
Darn you meddling kids!

653
00:48:14.059 --> 00:48:15.560
Arrest them all!

654
00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:19.230
I told you to throw
all of them into the volcano!

655
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:23.234
- Wait. stop.
- Arrest them.

656
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.703
I said arrest them!

657
00:48:41.086 --> 00:48:42.587
Looks
like Colonel Papa Qi.

658
00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.355
Colonel Papa Qi is back!

659
00:48:44.489 --> 00:48:47.258
Stop it!
It'll destroy the Kar-Lalo!

660
00:48:47.392 --> 00:48:50.095
Papa!
Papa Qi's coming to save us!

661
00:48:50.228 --> 00:48:52.497
Axel. Gaga.
just stay back!

662
00:48:56.434 --> 00:49:00.671
After 20 long years.
I'm done hiding.

663
00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:02.007
Colonel Papa Qi

664
00:49:02.107 --> 00:49:03.874
and the Kepler army
is here.

665
00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:11.916
You can't
tread on me!

666
00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:20.791
Axel. protect Gaga!

667
00:49:22.627 --> 00:49:24.229
Papa Qi!

668
00:49:27.365 --> 00:49:29.067
Axel. you were right.

669
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.270
Without courage.
life is meaningless.

670
00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:47.752
Papa Qi!

671
00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:49.954
Papa! Papa!

672
00:49:50.088 --> 00:49:52.223
- Gaga. wait!
- Papa!

673
00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:54.259
Gaga!

674
00:49:54.392 --> 00:49:55.760
Papa Qi!

675
00:49:57.162 --> 00:49:58.463
Papa!

676
00:50:22.187 --> 00:50:25.190
You attack my Kar-Lalo.
I'll kill you!

677
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.610
What is this monster?

678
00:50:48.213 --> 00:50:50.281
You attacked my papa!

679
00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:58.823
Axel!

680
00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:02.393
Dr. Vance. please.

681
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.495
We must stop this monster.

682
00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.178
Wait. be careful.

683
00:51:20.311 --> 00:51:21.846
Don't go near it!

684
00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.240
Huh?

685
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:07.358
What?

686
00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:11.196
Dr. Vance
is an Earther?

687
00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:15.400
Dr. Vance.

688
00:52:15.533 --> 00:52:18.303
Foolish Kunta.
you tried to trap me here.

689
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:20.805
but I finally
found a way home.

690
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:22.907
Did you think
hiding the Kar-Lalo

691
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.811
and wrecking our spaceship
meant that I'd never get back?

692
00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:30.080
Now. the Kar-Lalo's
super energy is all mine.

693
00:52:30.215 --> 00:52:33.984
and this entire wretched planet
will be my spaceship!

694
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:38.122
Nobody
can stop me returning home now.

695
00:52:38.256 --> 00:52:40.925
After all these years.

696
00:52:41.058 --> 00:52:44.729
I am going home!

697
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:50.167
Vance.
there's no way

698
00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:53.003
Luis Baba's
gonna let you do this.

699
00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:54.572
You turtle shelled traitor!

700
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:56.774
I'm gonna kick your--

701
00:52:59.344 --> 00:53:01.612
Ah! What are you doing?

702
00:53:01.746 --> 00:53:06.917
Stop it.
My Kar-Lalo!

703
00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:19.530
Dr. Vance. please!
Stop what's happening!

704
00:53:19.664 --> 00:53:21.131
Stop it. please!

705
00:53:33.278 --> 00:53:38.215
Thank you. Axel.
for helping me find Kar-Lalo.

706
00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:11.416
I am sorry. Kunta.

707
00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:14.485
I let you down.

708
00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:37.301
Kar-Lalo!

709
00:55:37.435 --> 00:55:40.671
Kar-Lalo! It's mine.

710
00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:44.141
My Kar-Lalo everywhere!

711
00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.944
I wasn't a big fake
after all.

712
00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.345
Just like I said. right?

713
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:56.687
I'm an awful person.

714
00:55:57.755 --> 00:55:59.924
Papa.
you are not a coward.

715
00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:02.593
I was wrong.

716
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.629
Papa.

717
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.035
Papa!

718
00:56:12.537 --> 00:56:14.338
Papa. where are you?

719
00:56:14.472 --> 00:56:15.506
Papa?

720
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.375
This is all my fault.

721
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:21.311
I got you
into this mess.

722
00:56:22.046 --> 00:56:25.783
I took away
our planet's hope.

723
00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:31.489
And now.
the dream is gone forever.

724
00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:38.295
Papa. now I understand
everything that you did for us.

725
00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:44.168
I can't even save
one tiny sprout.

726
00:56:44.669 --> 00:56:46.737
I can't do
anything at all.

727
00:56:47.572 --> 00:56:49.740
I'm useless.

728
00:56:51.576 --> 00:56:54.211
Axel.
we must stop Vance.

729
00:56:54.879 --> 00:56:59.416
It's all because of me
that the Kar-Lalo was destroyed.

730
00:57:00.084 --> 00:57:02.753
I never
should have come here.

731
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.056
Axel. you've always
been brave.

732
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.926
It's you who led us
all the way here.

733
00:57:09.059 --> 00:57:10.528
but now. you...

734
00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:14.765
Axel. you said
to look for Kar-Lalo.

735
00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:17.502
and I listened.
and followed you.

736
00:57:17.602 --> 00:57:20.838
You said
go in the volcano. and I went.

737
00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:23.508
I always
follow you. Axel.

738
00:57:23.608 --> 00:57:27.344
Well. that was a big mistake.

739
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:31.081
because I ruined
everything!

740
00:57:31.215 --> 00:57:35.085
Then I guess
I was wrong about you.

741
00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:38.122
Well. fine. then.
Come on. Jono.

742
00:57:38.756 --> 00:57:40.457
Axel.

743
00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:46.096
Axel. Fine!

744
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.265
Then I'll go with Gaga.

745
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:55.740
Brothers of the Burning City.

746
00:57:55.873 --> 00:57:58.743
today Vance has robbed us
of our last hope

747
00:57:58.876 --> 00:58:00.945
and he's going
to destroy our world.

748
00:58:01.078 --> 00:58:04.248
but we cannot let him
get away with that.

749
00:58:04.381 --> 00:58:09.486
So. I choose
to be a fighter like my Papa.

750
00:58:10.555 --> 00:58:12.990
Brothers. today.
we fight for ourselves.

751
00:58:13.157 --> 00:58:15.726
- We fight for ourselves!
- That's swell.

752
00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:18.996
but what if instead
you fight for Luis Baba?

753
00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:20.565
That's better. right?

754
00:58:20.665 --> 00:58:22.466
Be quiet!

755
00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:29.339
I order you to stop!

756
00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:32.677
Why isn't anyone stopping?

757
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.278
Alert. Alert.

758
00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.815
Defense mechanism activated.

759
00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:18.288
- Vance!
-Hm.

760
00:59:21.726 --> 00:59:24.328
Charge! Charge!

761
00:59:24.461 --> 00:59:26.997
Tear that thing apart.

762
00:59:42.012 --> 00:59:45.149
In your dreams. chuckleheads.

763
00:59:45.249 --> 00:59:50.187
Wait till you see
the force of my Demonticon!

764
01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:46.243
Axel! Axel.

765
01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.478
We have to do something
about the tentacles

766
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.580
so we can attack the hull!

767
01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:53.317
Axel. cover me.

768
01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.452
Lure them away.
I'll get us through.

769
01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.654
Axel copy.

770
01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:03.493
Today I'm Axel. Come on!

771
01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:17.341
-Anybody. come in!
- Gaga! Jono!

772
01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.945
Axel. where are you?

773
01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:23.413
Jono! Gaga!

774
01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:49.039
Gaga!

775
01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:50.707
Gaga!

776
01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:11.561
Hey. big jerk.

777
01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:13.163
You want me?

778
01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.567
Come and get me!
I'm not afraid!

779
01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:38.255
Threat eliminated.
Alarm cancelled.

780
01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:44.061
Fools.

781
01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:46.596
That was a waste of time.

782
01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.240
Planet
gravitational force

783
01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:58.909
will reverse in 10 minutes.

784
01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.611
Demonticon standing by.

785
01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:06.951
Alert. Alert.

786
01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:09.954
Defense mechanism activated.

787
01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.298
Dr. Vance. it's me.

788
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.732
Again.

789
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.704
Too late. Axel.

790
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.306
In 10 minutes.

791
01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:32.943
Kepler will be forced
into my wormhole.

792
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:36.146
Stop this pointless fighting.

793
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.647
It's like this.

794
01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.984
You're not gonna hurt
this planet anymore.

795
01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:43.320
Well. it's like I said.

796
01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.489
timing is everything.

797
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.924
You're right.

798
01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:48.592
but there's one thing

799
01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:51.161
that's way more important
than timing.

800
01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:56.060
Come on.
you snake monsters.

801
01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.395
Look here. right here!

802
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:03.233
One. two. three. four!

803
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.901
Go!

804
01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.376
Alert. Alert.

805
01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.578
Unidentified intruder.

806
01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.214
Unidentified intruder.

808
01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:45.775
Planet reverse gravitation
at 135 degrees.

809
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:54.451
You want
to be another Kunta?

810
01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:01.391
Who thinks himself
so just and so upright.

811
01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:03.627
who thinks
that he could save the world?

812
01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:04.961
Ha!

813
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.902
Misguided fool

814
01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:14.638
couldn't even save himself.

815
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.207
Kunta found a way
to give hope to Kepler.

816
01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.975
but you...

817
01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.080
Hope?

818
01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.082
What about my hope?

819
01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:29.419
If it wasn't for Kunta.
would I still be here?

820
01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.155
Am I wrong?

821
01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.996
I want to go home.

822
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:43.767
- Am I wrong?
- Go home?

823
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.837
What gives you the right
to destroy our Kar-Lalo?

824
01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.174
To destroy
our entire planet?

825
01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:20.937
Right now.

826
01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:24.208
I am the God of this world!

827
01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:30.214
Alarm cancelled.

828
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.516
Resuming normal function.

Space travel wormhole
is forming.

830
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.787
Okay. it's time.

831
01:07:41.325 --> 01:07:43.493
Landing gear locked.

832
01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:48.498
Life support system engaged.

833
01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.587
Even
if you smash everything.

834
01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.722
you can't stop
the reversal now.

835
01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.592
You can't stop me
from going home!

836
01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:19.363
Axel. stop wasting your energy.

837
01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:24.434

839
01:08:27.704 --> 01:08:29.706
Really?
Unauthorized input.-

840
01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.775
- It's all done.
-Come on!

841
01:08:31.908 --> 01:08:35.879
Planet reverse
gravitation at 155 degrees.

842
01:08:36.012 --> 01:08:37.347
It's all done?

843
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.948
Planet

844
01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:42.519

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.690
indistinct] experiencing energy.

846
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.892
I'll see you
on Earth!

847
01:08:49.025 --> 01:08:51.195
All entrances sealed.A

848
01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:57.767
Planet reverse gravitation
at 160 degrees.

849

850
01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:24.494
My goodness.

851
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.664
Oh. no.
What's that fool doing?

852
01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.862
Axel.
without courage.

853
01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.465
life is meaningless.

854
01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:54.017
Just a little closer.

855
01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:58.748
-Yeah. move it!
-Let's go.

856
01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:00.417
Come on!

857
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.452
Come on. let's go.

858
01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:15.832
Axel! It's Axel!

859
01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.801
Set him down. Putron.

860
01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:22.906
Axel's alive!
I knew that you wouldn't die!

861
01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.179
Why. Axel?

862
01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:33.483
That was my very last chance.

863
01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:37.353
You!
I did it for all of Kepler.

864
01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:40.323
I did
what you would have done

865
01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:42.926
to protect your homeland!

866
01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.677
Is that rain?

867
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.479
- It's raining!
- It's raining!

868
01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.950
It's raining!

869
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:10.987
It's raining!

870
01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:17.727
I never thought I'd feel
rain on my face again.

871
01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:22.732
Rain. rain. rain!

872
01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.401
Rain. rain. rain!

873
01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:28.572
Is this rain?

874
01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:30.707
Oh. my goodness!

875
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.743
I've never seen rain
in my whole life.

876
01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.012
Huh? What's that?

877
01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.882
Kar-Lalo?

878
01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:41.585
Look!
The Kar-Lalo is growing!

879
01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:43.553
Kar-Lalo!

880
01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:06.275
How badly I wish that Papa
was here to see all of this.

881
01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.949
Papa Qi!

882
01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:16.252
