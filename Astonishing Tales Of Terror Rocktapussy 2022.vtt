00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:40.649
- What do you see?

4
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:42.912
What is that?

5
00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:47.308
- Hey. move.

6
00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:52.095
Let's push through.

7
00:00:57.753 --> 00:00:59.276
How deep does it go?

8
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.843
- I can't see the end.

9
00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:02.540
- Huh. Are we
going in?

10
00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:08.198
Whoa.

11
00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:14.441
- Jesus. Churchy. what are you
trying to do.

12
00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:15.684
blind me or something?

13
00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:17.120
- Sorry. Bill.
New camera.

14
00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:18.489
- Yeah. well. you flash
that thing in my face

15
00:01:18.513 --> 00:01:20.123
one more time.
new camera or not.

16
00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:21.666
I'm gonna shove that
expensive piece of shit

17
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.320
where the sun don't shine.
you understand me?

18
00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:24.954
- Yeah. sure. Billy.
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:26.347
- Yeah.

20
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.802
- How much you pay
for that thing. anyway?

21
00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:29.263
Enough.

22
00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:31.265
- Probably spent all of
last month's paycheck

23
00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:33.876
trying to be something
other than what you are.

24
00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:35.878
- Oh. yeah?
What's that?

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.881
- Couple losers. just like us.

26
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.926
Come on.

27
00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.452
Shouldn't we tell
the others what we found?

28
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:46.410
- Oh. what are you afraid of?

29
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:47.822
Hey. maybe we find
something down here

30
00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.761
we can actually keep
for ourselves. huh?

31
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.155
You don't tell
anyone about this.

32
00:01:58.248 --> 00:01:59.815
- Churchill.
Churchill.

33
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:03.166
- Churchill.
- Come in. Churchill.

34
00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.593
Whoa.

35
00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.433
Ugh.

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.524
Ugh.

37
00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.570
Ugh.

38
00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.580
- I got you.

39
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.714
What the hell?

40
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.720
Hey. Billy.

41
00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:42.222
Buddy. buddy!

42
00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:46.182
Fuck!

43
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.401
- Help me. please!

44
00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:51.361
Oh. my god!

45
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:55.670
Go. go!

46
00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.454
- What. what?!
- Go!

47
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.110
- Billy. what is it?!
- Just run!

48
00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:06.681
Go. go. go!

49
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.558
Churchy. Churchy.
something's got me.

50
00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:17.561
Something's got me.

51
00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:19.128
- Come on.
- Something's got me!

52
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.521
Churchy. please.

53
00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:22.087
God. please.

54
00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:31.401
- Billy!

55
00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.924
No!

56
00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:34.491
Churchill.

57
00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.101
Churchill.

58
00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:39.061
Churchill!

59
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.011
- What's it gonna take

60
00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:29.666
to get a little more
than a dance?

61
00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:32.060
More?

62
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.631
- I just have one question.

63
00:07:39.676 --> 00:07:41.243
- Anything. darling.

64
00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:43.854
- On the record?

65
00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:47.989
Would you care to comment

66
00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:49.512
about the allegations
of drug use

67
00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:50.905
and solicitation of prostitution

68
00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:52.863
that has plagued
your time in office?

69
00:07:53.603 --> 00:07:55.518
What the hell is this?

70
00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:57.520
- Are you involved in
narcotic trafficking?

71
00:07:57.564 --> 00:07:59.435
If so. does the police board
know about it?

72
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:02.632
And if so. how can you actively
lobby for the restrictions

73
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.547
of such things if you
yourself engage in what is.

74
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:06.703
in your own words.
"contemptible actions"?

75
00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:09.227
Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!

76
00:08:09.663 --> 00:08:11.578
Needless to say.
the mayor definitely has

77
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:13.686
some difficult questions
to answer in the coming days.

78
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.973
Questions that this reporter
is waiting for

79
00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:17.584
with bated breath.

80
00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:20.195
I'm Hunter Hazelton
for Channel 8 News.

81
00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.459
For her role

82
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.593
in uncovering corruption
and fraud in the mayor's office

83
00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:30.553
congratulations
to Hunter Hazelton

84
00:08:30.597 --> 00:08:33.817
on her nominations for
Most Impactful News Story

85
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.907
and News Person of the Year.

86
00:08:38.866 --> 00:08:40.389
Oh.

87
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:42.304
Hi.

88
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.349
Oh. hi.

89
00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:46.961
Oh.

90
00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:50.486
Hi. Mm.
- Hi.

91
00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.271
What is she thinking?

92
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:55.056
She's giving us all a bad name.

93
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.753
- Well. speak for yourself.

94
00:08:56.797 --> 00:08:58.407
I'm above that kind
of tabloid journalism

95
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.322
if that's what you
want to call it.

96
00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:02.454
- Why doesn't she just go away

97
00:09:02.498 --> 00:09:04.674
and leave the news to
the real reporters?

98
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:10.332
Oh. look. here comes the
future Pulitzer winner now.

99
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.160
- Be nice.
- Bite me.

100
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:15.076
- Hi. Declan. Annie.
It's nice to see you both.

101
00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:17.731
- Hunter. congratulations.

102
00:09:17.774 --> 00:09:19.428
Your expose on the mayor

103
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:21.604
really touched a chord
with a lot of people.

104
00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:22.910
Lot of hits.
- Thank you.

105
00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:24.520
It was difficult work.

106
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.280
but I think we got some
really incriminating footage.

107
00:09:26.304 --> 00:09:28.611
And the DA is opening up
a new investigation.

108
00:09:28.655 --> 00:09:30.439
- That is impressive work.

109
00:09:30.482 --> 00:09:32.746
But I got to say. that. uh.

110
00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:34.835
that incriminating footage
really takes you back

111
00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:36.706
to that night in Vegas.
- Don't say it.

112
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.316
- Oh. that's right.

113
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.536
You two used to be a thing
back in the day.

114
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.756
- It was a long time ago. so...

115
00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:45.019
- Still. there's history.

116
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:48.326
- And you two are a thing now.

117
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.937
- We are.

118
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.634
- Great.

119
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:54.332
- Does take me back. though.
climbing the local news ladder.

120
00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:56.596
Drummond and Hazelton.
We made a great team.

121
00:09:57.074 --> 00:09:59.294
- We were a team.
It wasn't good.

122
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:01.949
- Ouch.
Feisty.

123
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.690
- I am happy
for the both of you.

124
00:10:03.733 --> 00:10:05.300
Really.

125
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.346
- You know. Hunter.

126
00:10:08.782 --> 00:10:10.435
you shouldn't have
to demean yourself

127
00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:12.133
to get this sort of attention.

128
00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:14.526
You can be a real reporter
without the...

129
00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:16.572
dancing?

130
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.661
Is that what
that was supposed to be?

131
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.054
Dancing?

132
00:10:20.097 --> 00:10:22.099
I mean. don't you think
as a woman professional-

133
00:10:24.362 --> 00:10:27.322
Dressing up in that getup
and dancing

134
00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:29.803
to get the eyeballs going.
don't you think you're...

135
00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:32.196
Oh. how do I say this?

136
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.111
Grasping?

137
00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:35.809
- A "real" reporter?
- Yeah.

138
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:38.207
- The problem. Annie.
with your type of feminism.

139
00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:40.683
is that it doesn't apply
to all women.

140
00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:43.468
Only the ones whose beliefs
and behaviors align with yours.

141
00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:46.689
Who's to say a woman can't be
smart. funny. and sexy.

142
00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:48.299
all at the same time?

143
00:10:48.343 --> 00:10:50.519
- Oh. the triple threat.

144
00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:52.390
- Here's a fourth:

145
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:53.957
if you don't stop being a bitch.

146
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:57.004
I'm gonna stick my foot
up your fake feminist fuck hole.

147
00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:58.483
Have a good evening.

148
00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:00.224
I heard
you're nominated as well.

149
00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:01.399
- I am. It's for...

150
00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:02.966
- I don't care.

151
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.318
- Are you fucking kidding me?

152
00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:08.711
- I'm sorry.

153
00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:10.191
I'm a fan of alliteration-

154
00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:11.714
- Ugh!
- Come on. you got to admit.

155
00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.585
that was impressive.

156
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:15.152
- Dad. Hailey.

157
00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:16.719
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:18.416
- Hi.
- Hi.

159
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.157
Hi. Mm.

160
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:22.377
- I am so glad you guys made it.

161
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.423
- Of course. I'm not gonna
miss my big sister's party.

162
00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:26.990
- So...

163
00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.644
What do you guys think?

164
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.515
My story was the top
trending story this week.

165
00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.604
Most views. hits and likes.

166
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:34.694
They re-upped my contract.

167
00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:36.584
I mean. this could really be
the type of exposure

168
00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:37.914
I've been looking for.

169
00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.481
- Because of. uh...

170
00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:43.703
- Yeah. Because of my
interview with the mayor.

171
00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:46.662
- Well. congratulations.

172
00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:49.360
- What?

173
00:11:49.796 --> 00:11:51.319
What's wrong?

174
00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:52.929
- Well. you know Dad.

175
00:11:52.973 --> 00:11:54.801
It's just-

176
00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:56.672
- Hunter. you know
I'm proud of you.

177
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.282
I'm proud of both of you

178
00:11:58.326 --> 00:12:00.347
for everything you've been able
to accomplish. you know?

179
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.633
- I know.

180
00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:04.201
- And I love you
no matter what you do.

181
00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:06.247
but do you have to do
what you do

182
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.683
dressed like that?

183
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.772
- Dad. I was undercover.

184
00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:11.861
- Maybe next time be...

185
00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:13.471
more covered.

186
00:12:13.515 --> 00:12:15.473
You know. undergarments.
all of it.

187
00:12:15.517 --> 00:12:17.040
You know. more.

188
00:12:20.348 --> 00:12:21.871
Congratulations.

189
00:12:22.393 --> 00:12:24.134
I'm very proud of you.
honey. Really.

190
00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.534
Okay.

191
00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:34.797
I guess we'll catch up later?

192
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.059
- Okay.

193
00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:38.801
- He's just Dad.

194
00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:40.455
- I know.

195
00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:42.413
- Congratulations. though.

196
00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:43.980
Agh.

197
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.767
Seriously. it is so awesome.

198
00:12:48.376 --> 00:12:50.204
- Thank you.

199
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:11.442
- Hey. Can't let all this
great champagne go to waste.

200
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.317
You did good. Hunter.

201
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:19.363
You proved without a doubt
that there's vice and corruption

202
00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:20.843
in the mayor's office.

203
00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:22.932
Hell. maybe we can
finally clean up the city.

204
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:25.805
You did good.

205
00:13:28.503 --> 00:13:30.070
Mm.

206
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.336
You okay?

207
00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:37.207
- Yeah.
Yeah. I'm okay.

208
00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:39.775
- No. you're not.

209
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:47.696
- I always wanted to be
a part of their party.

210
00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:50.090
You know. wanted their invite.
their awards.

211
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:52.396
their approval.

212
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:54.746
Guess I just wanted to belong.

213
00:13:55.922 --> 00:13:59.403
After all these years.
I finally get noticed

214
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.232
and it feels so...

215
00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:06.802
hollow.

216
00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:11.285
I have worked my entire life
for this chance.

217
00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:14.810
I don't have kids.
Never been married.

218
00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:17.987
I am turning 40 next month.

219
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.597
- Mm.

220
00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.341
- Why does winning feel so bad?

221
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:27.649
- Mm...
White privilege?

222
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:29.216
- Oh.

223
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.916
- We can only
do our best. Hunter.

224
00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:36.223
You're a damn good reporter.

225
00:14:36.832 --> 00:14:38.747
I know that and you know that.

226
00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:40.967
To hell with what
everyone else says.

227
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.404
I mean. you work hard.

228
00:14:43.447 --> 00:14:44.971
Harder than most.

229
00:14:45.014 --> 00:14:47.930
And you care about the truth.
wherever that may lead.

230
00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:50.541
And as for all the other stuff.

231
00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:53.153
maybe it feels hollow
because it is.

232
00:14:54.023 --> 00:14:55.938
because it always has been.

233
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.462
And you just have to fill it
with meaning.

234
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:01.335
- When did you become
such a philosopher?

235
00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:04.120
- I'm gay. We are
very self-aware.

236
00:15:04.816 --> 00:15:06.340
- Right.

237
00:15:06.862 --> 00:15:09.038
- Besides. haven't you heard?

238
00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:10.648
Journalism is dead.

239
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.650
Who wants to belong
to a dying cause?

240
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:15.044
- Well. then it's gonna
be one hell of a ride.

241
00:15:15.088 --> 00:15:16.437
Oh. yeah.

242
00:15:18.656 --> 00:15:20.180
- Mm.

243
00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.661
- All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

244
00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:26.534
Goodnight.
- 'Night. Cam.

245
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:31.974
- You dance to the beat
of your own drum. Hunter.

246
00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:33.497
That's not a bad thing.

247
00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:36.587
But it does get loud
from time to time.

248
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.459
- I love you.

249
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:40.417
- I love you. too.

250
00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:03.979
- Morning. darling.

251
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.937
I hope you have a wonderful day.

252
00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:07.216
Morning. Carey.

253
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.696
- Eddie.

254
00:18:08.739 --> 00:18:10.611
- Here to use the showers again?

255
00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:12.178
- Yeah.

256
00:18:12.221 --> 00:18:14.354
You know. things with Abby.

257
00:18:14.397 --> 00:18:16.356
- Hey. man. I'm not judging.

258
00:18:17.183 --> 00:18:19.054
- Still seeing what's-her-name?

259
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.664
- Janelle? No.

260
00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:21.839
- What happened?

261
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:23.537
- Turns out I'm an asshole.

262
00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:26.496
- Ah. join the club. partner.

263
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.020
- Have a good one.
- See you later.

264
00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:55.177
- Hey there. good buddy.

265
00:18:57.527 --> 00:19:00.400
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

266
00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:04.099
Big day today.

267
00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:56.820
- Mm. Good morning.

268
00:20:58.344 --> 00:20:59.910
- Morning.
- Mm.

269
00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:03.087
Mm.

270
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.089
- Mm.
- Mm.

271
00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:08.832
Hunter. are you in there?

272
00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:10.312
- Fuck.

273
00:21:12.749 --> 00:21:14.316
- You overslept.

274
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.752
- I overslept.

275
00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:17.339
- Hurry up. the test
is gonna be in a couple...

276
00:21:17.363 --> 00:21:19.539
Holy shit. Uh.

277
00:21:19.582 --> 00:21:21.541
- Yeah. Cam. this is. um...

278
00:21:22.498 --> 00:21:24.326
This is. um...

279
00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:27.242
- Frank.

280
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.592
- Frank. This is Frank.
Frank. this is Cam.

281
00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:31.202
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:32.856
You know. as a reporter.
you'd think

283
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.181
you'd ask more questions.
- That's fair.

284
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:35.598
Give me a second.
I'm gonna change.

285
00:21:35.642 --> 00:21:38.079
- Just make it quick.
We gotta go.

286
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:40.647
Uh...

287
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.867
So. um. you work out. I take it?

288
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:45.347
- Yeah.

289
00:21:45.391 --> 00:21:47.088
- Yeah. so do I.

290
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:49.786
I mean. not as much as you.
but. um.

291
00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:51.919
I-I-I work it.

292
00:21:52.398 --> 00:21:54.225
Um. yeah.

293
00:21:55.052 --> 00:21:56.576
Hunter?

294
00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:58.317
- Yeah.
Okay.

295
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.928
So this new mining tech.
what do we know about it?

296
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:02.973
- Engineers from Canada.
Russia. and the US

297
00:22:03.017 --> 00:22:05.417
developed a new prototype laser.
Today's the grand unveiling.

298
00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:07.326
Limited press.
Very exclusive.

299
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:09.042
And our passes will be there
waiting for us.

300
00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:10.348
- Great. I'll do
my hair in the van.

301
00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:11.721
Mm.

302
00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:14.724
Hi.

303
00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:17.205
I got to go.
but last night was fun.

304
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.947
The door will lock automatically
on its way out

305
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.689
and can you feed my cat
before you leave?

306
00:22:39.314 --> 00:22:41.142
- Darling.
- Asshole.

307
00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:43.492
- Hm...
You're still mad?

308
00:22:44.232 --> 00:22:46.147
- You embarrassed me
last night. Declan.

309
00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:49.890
- Wasn't the first time.
It won't be the last.

310
00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:52.153
Besides. you and I
make a great team.

311
00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:55.069
- Oh. like you and Hunter
were a good team?

312
00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:57.419
We're better alone.
thank you very much.

313
00:22:57.463 --> 00:22:59.247
Longest two weeks of my life.

314
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.554
I was really hoping
not to see you here.

315
00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:03.904
- Yet. here we are.
Still friends?

316
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:07.560
Okay. just friends.
I'm cool with that

317
00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:09.692
as long as we can still...

318
00:23:10.084 --> 00:23:12.826
Oh. it looks like they put
everyone's A-team on this.

319
00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:16.917
- Well. we can't let anybody
just crash the party.

320
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.484
now can we?

321
00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:21.878
Oh. you're a bad girl.

322
00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:23.576
- Mm.
You have no idea.

323
00:23:27.797 --> 00:23:29.451
- Oh. I have some idea.

324
00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:42.508
- Ah. hi. how can I help...

325
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:44.118
Mr. Davis?

326
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:45.511
- Hi. Eddie.

327
00:23:45.554 --> 00:23:47.097
- Huh. Mr. Davis.
what are you doing here?

328
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:49.036
Didn't you retire.
what. two years ago?

329
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:50.472
- Yeah. No. no.
two and a half.

330
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:51.560
Well. how you been?

331
00:23:51.604 --> 00:23:53.301
- I'm good. Eddie.
I'm good.

332
00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.477
Look. I was wondering.

333
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:58.132
I mean. I don't know. but...

334
00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:00.569
whether I might
visit the old place.

335
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:03.093
It's just. it's just
me at the cabin.

336
00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:05.966
I don't get many visitors.
you know. so I was wondering if-

337
00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:08.055
- Oh. yeah. the guys
will be happy to see you.

338
00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:09.491
- Thanks. Eddie.

339
00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:12.102
- Yeah. I'll sign you in.
Have a blast. huh?

340
00:24:30.556 --> 00:24:32.209
- Hey. there.

341
00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.038
Great.

342
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:38.041
It's not here.

343
00:24:38.085 --> 00:24:39.739
It's got to be.

344
00:24:40.261 --> 00:24:41.784
- Oh. hi.
Excuse me.

345
00:24:44.221 --> 00:24:45.658
Hi. I'm Hunter Hazelton.

346
00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:47.311
I'm here for the
mining experiments.

347
00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:49.270
but my pass seems to be missing.

348
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.141
Is there someone you can call?

349
00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:52.641
- I'm sorry. everyone
is already down there

350
00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:55.232
that has a pass and was invited.

351
00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:57.800
It's a restricted event.
Very exclusive.

352
00:24:57.844 --> 00:24:59.410
- Okay. Thanks.

353
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:02.762
It's not here. Are you sure
they were leaving it for us?

354
00:25:02.805 --> 00:25:04.372
- Yeah.
I'm sure.

355
00:25:04.415 --> 00:25:05.852
- What time is it?

356
00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:07.549
It's 8:40.

357
00:25:07.593 --> 00:25:09.484
- The test is gonna start.
We gotta find a way down there.

358
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:10.813
- Don't look at me.

359
00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:12.772
I mean. you're the expert
in infiltration.

360
00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:18.255
- I have an idea.

361
00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:19.822
Sorry.

362
00:25:21.084 --> 00:25:23.260
Ah. Jesus.

363
00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:25.175
- Don't be a baby.
It wasn't hot.

364
00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:27.830
Excuse me. hi. Do you have
a change room we can use?

365
00:25:27.874 --> 00:25:29.528
My cameraman
spilled his coffee. so...

366
00:25:30.354 --> 00:25:32.487
- Downstairs. down the hall.
to your left.

367
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.315
- Great.
Okay. come on.

368
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.450
- Could've warned me.
- There wasn't time.

369
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:41.322
Okay. I'll be right back.
Hold this.

370
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:43.019
- But that's the men's room.

371
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.109
My shirt.

372
00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:56.293
- Oh.

373
00:25:58.687 --> 00:26:00.254
Um...

374
00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:02.082
Think you're in the wrong place.

375
00:26:02.822 --> 00:26:05.476
- Well. that all depends
on what I'm looking for.

376
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.087
- Not sure how to answer that.

377
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.479
- I need your help.

378
00:26:08.523 --> 00:26:10.699
- Again. not sure
how to answer that.

379
00:26:10.743 --> 00:26:12.832
- I'm Hunter Hazelton.
Channel 8.

380
00:26:13.397 --> 00:26:14.964
I'm gonna keep my eyes up here.

381
00:26:15.008 --> 00:26:16.420
There was a mix-up
with my press badge

382
00:26:16.444 --> 00:26:17.726
and I need to get down
to where they're holding

383
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.578
the experimental mining test.

384
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.188
I know that's a lot to process.

385
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:22.905
but if you can get dressed
as quickly and help me out.

386
00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:24.321
that would be swell.

387
00:26:24.365 --> 00:26:25.584
I looked down.

388
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.281
Great. I meant great.

389
00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:29.979
- Not used to saying no
to beautiful women

390
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:33.243
when I'm standing in front
of them with no pants on. so...

391
00:26:33.287 --> 00:26:34.810
- So don't.

392
00:26:34.854 --> 00:26:36.943
This is
a Channel 22 special report.

393
00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:38.684
- We're going live on the scene

394
00:26:38.727 --> 00:26:40.642
to Annie Markowitz
at the Morgan Mine.

395
00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:41.904
Annie?

396
00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:43.340
- Thanks. Richard.

397
00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:46.082
I'm here with Russian engineer.
Alek Nicolai.

398
00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:48.911
as he's about to reveal
a technological breakthrough

399
00:26:48.955 --> 00:26:50.521
in the mining field.

400
00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:52.915
I really
appreciate it. I owe you one.

401
00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:55.309
- No problem. I'm Carey.
by the way. Carey Barnes.

402
00:26:55.352 --> 00:26:57.528
- Nice to meet you. Carey.
See you around.

403
00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:01.184
- You don't even
know her. Carey.

404
00:27:01.228 --> 00:27:03.012
Just back to work

405
00:27:03.056 --> 00:27:05.624
and forget about
the. uh. gorgeous.

406
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:08.583
beautiful. approachable woman
who entered and exi...

407
00:27:13.153 --> 00:27:15.590
Dammit.
Ah. what are you doing?

408
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:18.898
- A breakthrough made possible
through a trilateral partnership

409
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:21.074
between the United States.
Canada and Russia.

410
00:27:21.117 --> 00:27:22.553
in what hopes to be a new start

411
00:27:22.597 --> 00:27:24.120
to foreign relations.

412
00:27:25.208 --> 00:27:26.732
- Safety first.

413
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.406
I didn't think you were
gonna make it. Ms. Hazelton.

414
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.779
I'm glad you did.

415
00:27:30.823 --> 00:27:32.128
- Well. from what I hear.

416
00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.671
we're gonna see
some sci-fi shovelling.

417
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:35.131
- It's very exciting.

418
00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:43.183
- Dr. Nicolai. tell us a little
about your machine.

419
00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:50.799
- There are minuscule
pockets of energy in the air.

420
00:27:52.105 --> 00:27:54.760
Small charges. static shocks.

421
00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:58.024
- Yee-haw.

422
00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:05.509
- What our machine does
is it takes these tiny shocks

423
00:28:05.553 --> 00:28:08.295
and combines them
through a single prism.

424
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.825
This focused laser
can cut through

425
00:28:16.869 --> 00:28:20.002
the hardest materials
with incredible accuracy-

426
00:28:24.137 --> 00:28:27.575
All without drawing power
from anything but the air.

427
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:33.407
Revolutionary.
if I say so for myself.

428
00:28:39.587 --> 00:28:42.503
No longer will dangerous
explosives be required

429
00:28:42.546 --> 00:28:45.549
and the lives of innocent
men and women put at risk.

430
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.204
It's the future of mining.

431
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:52.861
- If this works. I'll be
in the unemployment line.

432
00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:00.826
- I can't let you go
any further.

433
00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:02.523
I have to stop you.

434
00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:04.481
What's he doing
here? Who let him down here?

435
00:29:04.525 --> 00:29:06.309
- You. turn that off.

436
00:29:06.832 --> 00:29:08.355
Turn it off! Now!

437
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.400
- Are you still rolling?

438
00:29:10.444 --> 00:29:12.359
- Yeah. We all are.

439
00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:13.945
- We've just received
word that there is

440
00:29:13.969 --> 00:29:16.406
a developing situation
at the Morgan Mine testing site.

441
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.495
We're going live right now.

442
00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:20.802
but early reports suggest
that what we're looking at

443
00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:23.979
is some kind of
hostage situation.

444
00:29:24.414 --> 00:29:26.460
Viewer discretion is advised.

445
00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:28.636
- Turn it off. Do it.

446
00:29:29.419 --> 00:29:31.247
You. turn it off. Do it now.

447
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:35.686
Goddammit. do it!

448
00:29:36.122 --> 00:29:37.688
- Okay. Okay.

449
00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.562
- There. it stopped.
I've turned it off.

450
00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:43.259
- Hilly. what are you doing?

451
00:29:43.303 --> 00:29:45.174
- Stay back.
This is too important.

452
00:29:45.218 --> 00:29:46.785
More than you know.

453
00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:48.482
More than you can possibly know.

454
00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:52.703
I tried to warn you.
but you wouldn't listen!

455
00:29:52.747 --> 00:29:54.401
- What's he talking about.
Marshall?

456
00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:57.230
- The man is certifiable.
He sent me a bunch of letters

457
00:29:57.273 --> 00:29:58.990
saying I shouldn't blast
this side of the mine.

458
00:29:59.014 --> 00:30:00.973
- I said don't dig here.

459
00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:03.845
I told you. it's too dangerous.

460
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:06.500
Dig anywhere else. but not here.

461
00:30:06.543 --> 00:30:08.371
- Hilly. what's going on?
You can talk to me.

462
00:30:08.415 --> 00:30:09.938
Talk to me.

463
00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:12.506
- We found something.

464
00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:14.813
something evil.

465
00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:16.597
all those years ago.

466
00:30:17.163 --> 00:30:18.860
I was only a kid then.

467
00:30:18.904 --> 00:30:22.646
But there's something here.
deep underground.

468
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:25.867
And it killed Billy.
And Todd.

469
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.217
And if you keep on going.

470
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:29.621
you're gonna open
the gates of hell

471
00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:31.438
and unleash the devil himself.

472
00:30:31.742 --> 00:30:33.396
- You said you found something.

473
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:36.312
What was it?

474
00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:39.533
- I don't know.
but it killed my friends.

475
00:30:39.576 --> 00:30:41.491
It took them away.

476
00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:44.146
All this time.
I watched and I waited.

477
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.366
I tried to keep people away
from this corner.

478
00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:49.673
but I knew this time
would eventually come.

479
00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:51.458
I've been preparing

480
00:30:51.501 --> 00:30:54.330
for this moment my whole life.

481
00:30:54.983 --> 00:30:57.072
I can't get it out of my head.

482
00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:01.947
Stop. goddammit. right there!

483
00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:03.992
You don't think
I'm serious about this?

484
00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:06.516
- Okay. okay.
I just want to talk. Hilly.

485
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.954
I want to know how to help you.
Let me help you.

486
00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:10.564
- Help me?

487
00:31:10.607 --> 00:31:12.958
No. don't you see?

488
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:14.873
I'm helping you.

489
00:31:15.482 --> 00:31:17.005
You think I'm crazy. right?

490
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.964
You think I'm making this up?

491
00:31:19.007 --> 00:31:21.488
Okay. you don't think
I'm serious about this?

492
00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:24.230
I'll show you.
I'm deadly fucking serious!

493
00:31:24.273 --> 00:31:25.796
- Holy Shit.

494
00:31:33.717 --> 00:31:35.241
- Jesus. Dad!

495
00:31:35.284 --> 00:31:36.938
Would it really kill you.
just once.

496
00:31:36.982 --> 00:31:38.548
to answer the phone?

497
00:31:38.984 --> 00:31:40.550
- What?

498
00:31:41.334 --> 00:31:42.901
Why?
- You haven't heard?!

499
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.033
- Heard what?

500
00:31:47.688 --> 00:31:49.646
Hailey.

501
00:31:52.171 --> 00:31:53.912
- Hunter's down there. Dad.

502
00:32:00.135 --> 00:32:01.702
- There's no way

503
00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:05.097
I'm gonna take
any chances. Not again.

504
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.577
It'll never take me alive.

505
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:21.635
Churchill.

506
00:32:29.338 --> 00:32:31.558
- What was that?

507
00:32:33.908 --> 00:32:35.431
- You must've awakened it.

508
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:46.660
Help me!

509
00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:48.923
Something's got... No!

510
00:32:52.753 --> 00:32:54.233
What's pulling him?!

511
00:32:54.276 --> 00:32:55.843
Help me!

512
00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:57.540
- Me?

513
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:05.635
- Abandon hope.

514
00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:08.725
all ye who enter here!

515
00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:10.162
- No!

516
00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:15.384
- Oh. my god.

517
00:33:21.608 --> 00:33:23.131
Come on.

518
00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:58.862
- Hunter!
Hunter!

519
00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:01.169
Come on! This place
is coming down around us!

520
00:34:01.213 --> 00:34:02.953
We have to go!

521
00:34:10.787 --> 00:34:12.920
- An explosion has rocked
the Morgan Mine.

522
00:34:12.963 --> 00:34:14.617
- Hailey. she's gonna be okay.

523
00:34:15.488 --> 00:34:17.055
Hunter...

524
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:18.926
Hunter's a survivor.

525
00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:21.363
- working underground
at the testing site.

526
00:34:22.147 --> 00:34:24.584
and offer our prayers
for their safety and well-being.

527
00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:11.109
- Hello?

528
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:14.416
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

529
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.723
It's me. It's me. Hunter.
Carey. Remember?

530
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:19.552
- Oh. yeah.
Carey.

531
00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:22.598
Oh. um. I'm sorry.
I thought you were. um...

532
00:35:22.642 --> 00:35:24.731
- You thought I was
a giant monster

533
00:35:24.774 --> 00:35:27.125
coming to finish you off?
- Is that what that was?

534
00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:29.562
- Honestly. I have
no fucking idea.

535
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:33.566
- You saved me.

536
00:35:33.914 --> 00:35:35.959
- Well. I wouldn't go
that far. I carried you.

537
00:35:36.003 --> 00:35:39.049
I put you in the cart and I
went looking for survivors.

538
00:35:39.093 --> 00:35:40.616
- And?

539
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.402
- None that I could find
but I found this.

540
00:35:43.445 --> 00:35:46.361
- That's the bag the old man had
before he went all...

541
00:35:46.883 --> 00:35:49.364
- Churchill.
His name is Churchill.

542
00:35:51.497 --> 00:35:53.063
- You knew him.

543
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:54.848
- Yeah. I did.

544
00:35:56.023 --> 00:35:57.938
Electrical wire.

545
00:35:57.981 --> 00:35:59.505
Flashlights.

546
00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:03.465
An old photo of him
and his mining buddies.

547
00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:05.293
And a gun.

548
00:36:05.337 --> 00:36:06.903
- Oh.

549
00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:10.951
Oh. no.
The. uh. the gun.

550
00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:13.214
Yeah.

551
00:36:13.258 --> 00:36:14.955
- You know how to use
one of those?

552
00:36:14.998 --> 00:36:16.435
- Do you?

553
00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:19.612
My name's not Hunter

554
00:36:19.655 --> 00:36:21.570
because my parents
were a bunch of hippies.

555
00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:28.229
I guess I should thank you.

556
00:36:28.273 --> 00:36:29.796
- For what?

557
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:32.581
- For carrying me
and making sure I was okay.

558
00:36:34.235 --> 00:36:36.281
- Like I said. don't sweat it.

559
00:36:36.324 --> 00:36:38.239
It's the bare minimum
I could do.

560
00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:41.068
- In that case.

561
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:43.026
I thank you
for the bare minimum.

562
00:36:43.984 --> 00:36:45.681
- You're welcome.

563
00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:48.075
- Oh.
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

564
00:36:48.423 --> 00:36:50.338
- Oh. I thought that...

565
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.384
- Oh. Oh.

566
00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:56.126
No. I was just. um.
just thanking you. so...

567
00:36:57.302 --> 00:37:00.087
- The time and place.
stressful situation.

568
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.003
- So bare minimum
deserves a kiss now?

569
00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:05.353
- I was trying to be humble.

570
00:37:07.312 --> 00:37:08.835
- Try harder.

571
00:37:09.966 --> 00:37:11.794
- Okay. cool.
All right.

572
00:37:11.838 --> 00:37:13.448
- We should find a way
out of here.

573
00:37:13.492 --> 00:37:15.470
I mean. there's still hope
that the others are still alive

574
00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:17.713
and given the current
circumstances of the. um...

575
00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:19.106
- Giant monster.

576
00:37:19.149 --> 00:37:20.499
- Giant monster
down here with us.

577
00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:22.109
we shouldn't stay in one place.

578
00:37:22.152 --> 00:37:25.373
Agreed?
- Agreed. Let's go.

579
00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:39.169
Okay. easy. easy.

580
00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:40.736
Need to rest.

581
00:37:42.782 --> 00:37:44.871
How is he?

582
00:37:44.914 --> 00:37:46.351
- Who. him?
He's fine.

583
00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:48.178
He just lost a little blood.
He'll be great.

584
00:37:48.222 --> 00:37:50.137
Da. comrade?
- Sure.

585
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.704
I'll be fine.

586
00:37:52.095 --> 00:37:53.662
- I don't believe it.

587
00:37:53.706 --> 00:37:56.361
He just. he just
pushed the button and-

588
00:37:56.404 --> 00:37:58.972
- We all saw it. Annie.
- Boom.

589
00:37:59.015 --> 00:38:02.410
- Look. anyone that straps an
explosive vest to their body

590
00:38:02.454 --> 00:38:05.065
and detonates him. or herself.
is clearly deranged.

591
00:38:05.892 --> 00:38:07.763
Personally. it was terrorists.

592
00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:10.244
- No. it wasn't a terrorist.
- Come on.

593
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:12.115
- I think he was
trying to protect us.

594
00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:13.856
- Protect us from what exactly?

595
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.684
- You're telling me
you didn't see it?

596
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:17.947
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

597
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:20.123
- The giant octopus
that attacked us?

598
00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:21.536
You can't tell me
you don't remember.

599
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.952
- No. that's impossible.

600
00:38:22.996 --> 00:38:24.606
There has to be a
logical explanation.

601
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.348
- Yeah. terrorists.
- No. he wasn't a terrorist.

602
00:38:27.392 --> 00:38:29.002
Ugh!

603
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:31.352
- I can't logically explain
any of what just happened.

604
00:38:31.396 --> 00:38:32.919
But we all saw it. right?

605
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.052
- No. it's not possible. okay?

606
00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:38.664
We could all be suffering
some mass delusion

607
00:38:38.707 --> 00:38:40.405
caused by a stressful situation.

608
00:38:40.448 --> 00:38:42.145
Ooh. or a gas leak maybe.

609
00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:43.843
- Biological weapon.
Did anybody get

610
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:46.125
a good look at the vest because
I'm positive he was all. like-

611
00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:48.630
- He wasn't a terrorist. man!
- Well. I'm terrified.

612
00:38:48.674 --> 00:38:50.153
all right. man?!

613
00:38:50.197 --> 00:38:52.330
- It wasn't a figment
of our imagination!

614
00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:55.376
It was a giant goddamn
octopus and it was real!

615
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.247
It killed your cameraman.
for Christ's sake!

616
00:38:57.291 --> 00:38:58.727
- Okay!

617
00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:00.338
Okay. you're right!
I'm sorry!

618
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:03.776
It was as crazy as it sounds.

619
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:06.387
a giant goddamn octopus!

620
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:08.824
Oh. Jesus. I'm shaking.

621
00:39:08.868 --> 00:39:11.044
- Oh. god.
Here we go.

622
00:39:11.087 --> 00:39:13.307
- Does anybody have a smoke?
- No!

623
00:39:21.184 --> 00:39:23.665
- Hey.
What was his name?

624
00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:26.842
- Whose?

625
00:39:26.886 --> 00:39:29.279
- Your. um. your cameraman.

626
00:39:31.891 --> 00:39:33.414
You don't know his name. do you?

627
00:39:33.458 --> 00:39:34.894
- Yeah.

628
00:39:34.937 --> 00:39:36.548
It was...

629
00:39:36.591 --> 00:39:38.376
Camera Man.

630
00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:40.160
- You got to be
fucking kidding me.

631
00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:42.641
- Well. I'm sorry if his name
was hard to remember. okay?

632
00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:44.338
What's your name?
- It's Cam.

633
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:46.035
- Cam.
Cam the cameraman.

634
00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:48.255
Piece of cake.
I would've remembered that!

635
00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:55.436
Not good. huh?

636
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.220
Not good.

637
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:00.615
- What are we gonna do?

638
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:02.878
- Die. Probably.

639
00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:04.967
- Well. do we know if
anybody else survived?

640
00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:07.056
- No. It was chaos.

641
00:40:09.102 --> 00:40:11.321
Did you two see
what happened to Hunter?

642
00:40:11.365 --> 00:40:12.888
- No.
- No.

643
00:40:13.672 --> 00:40:15.674
- Okay. we're not in bad shape.

644
00:40:16.065 --> 00:40:17.850
We're more than capable
of figuring this out

645
00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:19.504
as long as we stay calm.

646
00:40:19.547 --> 00:40:21.854
- Okay.
- We have two scientists

647
00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:23.508
at our disposal.

648
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:25.118
We're gonna be fine.

649
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:26.467
Cam?

650
00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:28.077
- Yeah.

651
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:30.515
- He's dead.

652
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.605
- Okay. we have one scientist.

653
00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:40.655
- So. what's your story?

654
00:40:41.221 --> 00:40:42.744
- My story?

655
00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:44.354
- Yeah.

656
00:40:44.398 --> 00:40:46.052
Who are you?
Details. you know?

657
00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:47.836
- I don't know about any story.

658
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.534
You being a reporter right now?

659
00:40:49.838 --> 00:40:51.512
- As opposed to when I'm being
a damsel in distress

660
00:40:51.536 --> 00:40:52.948
who needs a big.
strong man to save me

661
00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:54.887
and sweep me off my feet?

662
00:40:56.584 --> 00:40:58.499
I am just making conversation.

663
00:40:58.543 --> 00:41:01.110
And who knows how long
we're gonna be down here?

664
00:41:01.154 --> 00:41:02.740
Hell. this might be
the last conversation

665
00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:04.462
either one of us ever has.

666
00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:08.640
- Carey Barnes.

667
00:41:08.683 --> 00:41:11.381
44 years old.
Former star quarterback.

668
00:41:11.425 --> 00:41:13.166
Scholarships.
the whole 10 yards.

669
00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:15.603
- Oh. um. nine yards.

670
00:41:16.604 --> 00:41:18.171
- What?
- The saying.

671
00:41:18.214 --> 00:41:19.757
I mean. it's the whole
nine yards. not 10.

672
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:21.348
And. well. you said 10.

673
00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:24.743
- Doesn't make any sense.
It's 10 yards to a first down.

674
00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:26.396
Are you sure?

675
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.963
- Go on.

676
00:41:29.008 --> 00:41:31.880
- Anyways. Uh.
former star quarterback.

677
00:41:31.924 --> 00:41:34.622
Prom king.
I married the prom queen.

678
00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:37.886
First year of college.
I blew out my ACL and MCL

679
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:40.715
and I missed the draft
'cause I didn't recover in time.

680
00:41:40.759 --> 00:41:42.325
Missed going to the pros.

681
00:41:42.369 --> 00:41:44.850
And I found myself losing for
the very first time

682
00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:46.329
in my life.

683
00:41:46.373 --> 00:41:47.940
Wife and I decided
to have a baby.

684
00:41:47.983 --> 00:41:49.570
Thought that maybe it
would change things.

685
00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:51.117
And it did for a while.

686
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.249
Made me forget who I used to be.

687
00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:54.816
For a while at least.

688
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.426
- And now?

689
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.037
- Divorced.

690
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.561
I work here. digging really
deep holes in the ground.

691
00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:02.345
Just trying to survive
one day at a time.

692
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.782
And I got to tell you.

693
00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:06.045
this day has
thrown me for a loop.

694
00:42:06.698 --> 00:42:08.264
- Whoa.

695
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:14.488
- Do we keep going?

696
00:42:20.799 --> 00:42:22.365
That's a yes.

697
00:42:39.382 --> 00:42:41.994
- Look at that.
There's a ledge on both sides.

698
00:42:42.516 --> 00:42:44.039
We can make it.

699
00:42:44.387 --> 00:42:45.954
- Well. we can. but whoa.

700
00:42:45.998 --> 00:42:47.782
- Did you ever
play lava as a kid?

701
00:42:47.826 --> 00:42:49.392
You know. with couch cushions?

702
00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:50.872
- Yeah.

703
00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:52.831
- Well. this is just like that.

704
00:42:53.527 --> 00:42:55.050
- Except with real lava

705
00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:57.313
that kills you instantly
when you touch it.

706
00:42:57.357 --> 00:42:59.881
- So. don't touch it.

707
00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:02.449
- Goddammit.

708
00:43:04.669 --> 00:43:07.585
Would this be a bad time
to ask something about you?

709
00:43:07.628 --> 00:43:09.151
Shoot.

710
00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:11.284
- You always so gung-ho?

711
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.460
- What do you mean?

712
00:43:13.503 --> 00:43:15.549
- Not looking before you leap.

713
00:43:16.898 --> 00:43:18.596
Danger in your blood.

714
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:21.120
Shimmying across a narrow ledge

715
00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:25.211
with the potential to fall
into a bubble bath of death.

716
00:43:25.254 --> 00:43:26.865
- Calculated risks.

717
00:43:26.908 --> 00:43:28.828
I mean. I'm not gonna be
some damsel in distress.

718
00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:32.174
just waiting for a man
with a hero complex to save me.

719
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:33.741
- Hero complex?

720
00:43:33.785 --> 00:43:35.177
- I follow my gut.

721
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:36.744
Always.

722
00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:38.877
And. right now.
my gut is telling me

723
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.531
that that's the way
to get answers.

724
00:43:42.315 --> 00:43:44.186
- Do I want to know
the question?

725
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.753
- Trust me.

726
00:43:53.195 --> 00:43:54.719
Don't let go!

727
00:43:54.762 --> 00:43:56.285
- I'm trying really hard not to.

728
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:57.678
- Your knees?

729
00:43:57.722 --> 00:43:59.027
- What's left of them.

730
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.511
- There's a ledge.
Can you swing me over?

731
00:44:04.554 --> 00:44:06.078
- Maybe.

732
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:08.515
Okay. we can do this.

733
00:44:08.558 --> 00:44:10.038
- I don't know.

734
00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:11.779
- Carey.

735
00:44:11.823 --> 00:44:13.389
Carey.

736
00:44:13.433 --> 00:44:14.956
We can do this.

737
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.132
- Okay.
You ready?

738
00:44:17.176 --> 00:44:18.743
- Yeah.
- One.

739
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:21.746
Two.

740
00:44:36.935 --> 00:44:38.501
Hey...

741
00:44:38.545 --> 00:44:40.460
we'll come back for him.
I promise.

742
00:44:41.853 --> 00:44:43.419
- Thank you.

743
00:44:43.463 --> 00:44:45.813
- You actually think
we're getting outta here?

744
00:44:45.857 --> 00:44:48.642
More likely. we're all gonna
be buried down here together.

745
00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:50.513
'cause if that thing
doesn't kill us.

746
00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:52.298
the roof collapsing in
probably will.

747
00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:53.865
- Shut up. Declan.

748
00:44:53.908 --> 00:44:55.756
- Oh. we are all gonna die
horrible. horrible deaths.

749
00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.825
- Declan!
Shut up.

750
00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.609
They're not gonna
leave us down here.

751
00:44:59.653 --> 00:45:01.176
They will find a way.

752
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.525
Do you think?

753
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:04.092
People buried in mine.

754
00:45:04.136 --> 00:45:05.441
It's ratings gold.

755
00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:06.747
And the longer this drags out.

756
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:08.231
the more the network's
gonna love it.

757
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.011
"Declan Drummond
buried alive."

758
00:45:10.055 --> 00:45:11.752
And I'm not even
there to report it.

759
00:45:11.796 --> 00:45:13.493
- Can't be that jaded.

760
00:45:13.536 --> 00:45:15.340
- Look. kid. until you've sat
in a network boardroom trying

761
00:45:15.364 --> 00:45:18.019
to figure out how to improve
ratings. shut the hell up.

762
00:45:18.063 --> 00:45:19.673
'cause I guarantee
you right now.

763
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.085
they're dragging the dead
Russki's family out in front

764
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:23.590
of the cameras and
people are eating it up.

765
00:45:23.633 --> 00:45:25.244
No offense to your comrade.

766
00:45:25.287 --> 00:45:26.811
May God rest his
commie bastard soul.

767
00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:28.614
- The hell is wrong with you?!
- Oh. whoa. whoa. okay.

768
00:45:28.638 --> 00:45:30.162
Look. I got a bit
of a condition. okay?

769
00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:31.859
And I get. like.
when I'm in anxious

770
00:45:31.903 --> 00:45:33.426
or I'm in stressful situations.

771
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:35.491
I just tend to blurt out
whatever comes into my mind.

772
00:45:35.515 --> 00:45:36.734
I don't have a filter. Asian!

773
00:45:36.777 --> 00:45:38.648
Goddamn. sorry.
- Calm down. shut up.

774
00:45:38.692 --> 00:45:40.433
- Okay.
Thank you.

775
00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:42.348
- You date this asshole?

776
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:43.915
- Uh. dated.
Past tense.

777
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.265
- Okay. we broke up. like.
yesterday.

778
00:45:46.308 --> 00:45:47.919
so the past tense thing-

779
00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:49.287
- Okay. and as much
as I'd love to see

780
00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:51.052
you take a swing at him-
- Whoa.

781
00:45:51.096 --> 00:45:53.489
- He's telling you the truth.
He's an idiot.

782
00:45:53.533 --> 00:45:55.056
- See?
Told you.

783
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.666
- Doctor diagnosed.

784
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.408
- Yeah. I've even got medicine
for days when it's bad.

785
00:45:59.452 --> 00:46:01.541
Well. take two.

786
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:11.072
- Well. that's not really
the recommended dosage.

787
00:46:11.116 --> 00:46:13.509
but maybe I can...

788
00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:16.556
Guys?

789
00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:18.558
Guys?

790
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:33.094
- Thanks.

791
00:46:33.138 --> 00:46:34.792
That's twice now
you've helped me.

792
00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:37.882
- Yeah. I guess so.

793
00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:40.972
- Do you feel that?

794
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:42.582
It's hot.

795
00:46:44.236 --> 00:46:45.803
- Yeah.

796
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:49.110
- No. I mean.
it's really. really hot!

797
00:46:50.677 --> 00:46:52.157
Hot. hot. hot. hot. hot.

798
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.028
Oh. shoe.

799
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:58.598
What the hell is that?

800
00:46:59.904 --> 00:47:01.601
It's some kind of altar.

801
00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:03.081
- Altar?

802
00:47:03.124 --> 00:47:04.909
What is this.
some kind of church?

803
00:47:04.952 --> 00:47:06.649
- No denomination I know of.

804
00:47:12.568 --> 00:47:14.222
It's all carved out of stone.

805
00:47:21.142 --> 00:47:22.796
These are amazing.

806
00:47:26.408 --> 00:47:27.932
- I've seen these before.

807
00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:29.194
- Really?

808
00:47:29.237 --> 00:47:30.543
- Yeah. when my
daughter sends me

809
00:47:30.586 --> 00:47:32.501
a text message
filled with emojis.

810
00:47:33.328 --> 00:47:34.852
- Funny.
- Hm.

811
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.419
Amazing how civilization
has reached a point

812
00:47:37.463 --> 00:47:39.726
where it can communicate
through cartoons.

813
00:47:40.074 --> 00:47:42.990
- The people here.
they worshiped the monster.

814
00:47:43.034 --> 00:47:44.600
Like some kind of deity.

815
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:46.907
They brought it what they could.

816
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:48.953
or they would
suffer the consequences.

817
00:47:49.997 --> 00:47:51.607
- Consequences?

818
00:47:51.651 --> 00:47:54.001
- Yeah. look.
it's pretty graphic.

819
00:47:56.134 --> 00:47:58.963
- Oh. you're not kidding.
Is that the queen?

820
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:01.704
- I'm not sure.
But look. there's more.

821
00:48:01.748 --> 00:48:03.968
Eight acolytes
surround the monster.

822
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:06.100
creating some kind of
larger force.

823
00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:09.799
Their power extends
far beyond anything

824
00:48:09.843 --> 00:48:11.366
we could ever imagine.

825
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.674
- Hunter. I think
I found their queen.

826
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.984
- That's not their queen.

827
00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:22.900
She's the sacrifice. Look.

828
00:48:23.422 --> 00:48:25.206
They fed their purest
to the monster

829
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.816
to keep it satisfied.

830
00:48:27.252 --> 00:48:28.993
- Virgin sacrifice?

831
00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:30.995
- Is there any other kind?

832
00:48:31.038 --> 00:48:32.605
- Sure.

833
00:48:32.648 --> 00:48:34.912
Custody every other weekend
and every third holiday.

834
00:48:34.955 --> 00:48:36.478
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

835
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:40.004
- But it looks like she
doesn't die after the ritual.

836
00:48:40.047 --> 00:48:41.614
After the sacrifice.
she becomes...

837
00:48:42.528 --> 00:48:44.051
something more.

838
00:48:45.009 --> 00:48:46.662
- Maybe she was a keeper.

839
00:48:47.054 --> 00:48:49.404
Good looks. smart. funny.

840
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.102
You know. the total package.

841
00:48:51.145 --> 00:48:53.123
- Yeah. well. she's been dead
for a couple hundred years.

842
00:48:53.147 --> 00:48:54.757
I'm pretty sure
her conversation skills

843
00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:56.934
would leave much to be desired.

844
00:48:56.977 --> 00:48:58.805
- If six years of marriage
taught me anything.

845
00:48:58.848 --> 00:49:00.894
it's that silence is golden.

846
00:49:05.594 --> 00:49:07.118
Fuck!

847
00:49:07.161 --> 00:49:08.486
- Great. we've been
walking around in circles.

848
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.642
Well. that's just perfect.

849
00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:10.904
- You're not helping. Declan.

850
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.142
- How do you want me
to help. Annie?

851
00:49:12.166 --> 00:49:13.472
Maybe you can tell me
how to move

852
00:49:13.515 --> 00:49:14.971
two billion tons of
rock out of the way.

853
00:49:14.995 --> 00:49:16.581
- Well. you are an expert
in shovelling shit.

854
00:49:16.605 --> 00:49:17.911
- Oh. and you would know?

855
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:19.367
- You know what.
I wouldn't even be here

856
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:20.827
if it wasn't for you.

857
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.022
- You wouldn't be anywhere
if it wasn't for me.

858
00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:23.326
You'd still be
doing the weather.

859
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:24.918
Oh. really?

860
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.504
You know what.
I am so sick and tired of-

861
00:49:26.528 --> 00:49:27.897
- You're sick and tired of me?
- Can you fix it?

862
00:49:27.921 --> 00:49:29.444
No. It's done.

863
00:49:30.054 --> 00:49:31.577
But. uh.

864
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.492
maybe I can build
something else.

865
00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:35.189
- You think so?

866
00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:37.278
- Maybe.
With a little time.

867
00:49:37.322 --> 00:49:38.801
Some luck.

868
00:49:38.845 --> 00:49:40.499
- That's what I like to hear.

869
00:49:40.542 --> 00:49:42.196
- I'm gonna need those goggles.

870
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.415
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

871
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:44.894
This is all your fault!

872
00:49:44.938 --> 00:49:46.524
- It's not my fault!
Nothing's my fault. okay?

873
00:49:46.548 --> 00:49:48.048
- "Look at me. I'm Declan.
I'm off my pills."

874
00:49:48.072 --> 00:49:49.551
- Oh-
- Hey. guys.

875
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:51.205
- What?!
- Kennedy thinks she might be

876
00:49:51.249 --> 00:49:52.922
able to construct something
that'll get us out of here.

877
00:49:52.946 --> 00:49:54.295
- Doubt it.

878
00:49:54.339 --> 00:49:55.993
- Annie. I want you
to stay with her.

879
00:49:56.036 --> 00:49:57.559
Okay.

880
00:49:59.431 --> 00:50:00.998
- What do you need me to do?

881
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:02.584
- You and I are gonna
keep searching for the others.

882
00:50:02.608 --> 00:50:04.740
- Oh. fuck the others.
That's their bad luck.

883
00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:06.742
I mean. those brave souls

884
00:50:06.786 --> 00:50:09.310
will be forever remembered
and deeply mourned.

885
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:12.574
- Look. come here.

886
00:50:12.618 --> 00:50:14.359
Kennedy's plan might not work-

887
00:50:14.402 --> 00:50:16.056
- Oh. no shit.

888
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.711
- But we got to keep searching
for the others. You and me.

889
00:50:18.754 --> 00:50:20.713
I mean. like heroes.

890
00:50:20.756 --> 00:50:22.410
That's got to be
newsworthy. right?

891
00:50:22.454 --> 00:50:24.064
- Heroes. huh?
- Well. maybe.

892
00:50:24.108 --> 00:50:26.371
If the cape fits.

893
00:50:27.676 --> 00:50:29.809
- Declan Drummond.
A man of his time.

894
00:50:29.852 --> 00:50:31.376
- Sure.

895
00:50:31.419 --> 00:50:34.161
- An icon of extraordinary
physical prowess.

896
00:50:34.205 --> 00:50:36.729
- I mean. that might be pushing
it just a little bit. but-

897
00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:38.165
- Okay. shut up.
I'm in.

898
00:50:38.209 --> 00:50:39.775
- Great. Thanks. Declan.

899
00:50:39.819 --> 00:50:41.995
- Yeah.
- You got this. yeah?

900
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.737
- Yeah.

901
00:50:45.825 --> 00:50:47.348
- Let's go. hero.

902
00:50:47.392 --> 00:50:49.394
Ah. god.

903
00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:55.095
- Guys. guys!
I found my earring!

904
00:50:57.576 --> 00:50:59.099
Mwah.

905
00:51:11.677 --> 00:51:13.592
- These are
hundreds of years old.

906
00:51:14.636 --> 00:51:16.464
Maybe more.

907
00:51:17.161 --> 00:51:19.380
How did you guys
not find this place?

908
00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:23.645
- Um. Earth's pretty big.
Lot of places to dig.

909
00:51:23.689 --> 00:51:25.473
We get to everything
eventually. though.

910
00:51:25.517 --> 00:51:27.432
- Oh. Flashlight?

911
00:51:30.174 --> 00:51:31.784
- What are you doing?

912
00:51:31.827 --> 00:51:33.612
- I am documenting.

913
00:51:34.482 --> 00:51:36.832
People are gonna want to know
all about this.

914
00:51:36.876 --> 00:51:39.313
And it's. um.
the only camera I have. so...

915
00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:42.403
How's your knee?

916
00:51:43.187 --> 00:51:44.753
- Fall didn't help.

917
00:51:49.976 --> 00:51:52.283
Can I be honest with you
for a sec?

918
00:51:52.761 --> 00:51:54.285
- Yeah. sure.

919
00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:57.549
- That was a stupid call.
Hunter.

920
00:51:57.592 --> 00:51:59.028
- Excuse me?

921
00:51:59.072 --> 00:52:01.248
- The lava. That was
an unnecessary risk.

922
00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:02.336
You could've died.

923
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.946
- But I didn't.

924
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:06.688
And we would've never
found this place if I hadn't.

925
00:52:06.732 --> 00:52:09.387
- We could've died.
What if I hadn't caught you?

926
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.823
- But you did.

927
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.216
- Yeah. but what if
I dropped you?

928
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:14.348
Or you dragged me down with you?

929
00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:16.196
- Why are we talking about
what could've happened?

930
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.873
We made it out okay.

931
00:52:17.917 --> 00:52:20.441
Besides. it was your choice
to reach out and catch me.

932
00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:22.400
You didn't have to.

933
00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:26.621
- Of course I did.
I wasn't gonna let you fall.

934
00:52:27.361 --> 00:52:28.928
- My hero.

935
00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:33.628
- Hey. I'm not gonna let you
brush this off.

936
00:52:33.672 --> 00:52:35.413
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I think

937
00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:37.371
and. goddammit.
you're gonna listen to me.

938
00:52:45.466 --> 00:52:47.773
- Can it wait?
- It can wait.

939
00:52:54.736 --> 00:52:56.999
- If you plan on making
something

940
00:52:57.043 --> 00:52:59.872
that gets us out of here.
I think you better hurry!

941
00:53:34.254 --> 00:53:35.777
- Wow.

942
00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:39.303
You really just picked
that up. didn't you?

943
00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:51.140
Carey. watch out!

944
00:53:52.925 --> 00:53:54.840
Hoo! Hoo!

945
00:53:54.883 --> 00:53:56.972
Hunter!
- Yep.

946
00:54:10.943 --> 00:54:12.466
- Thanks.

947
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.076
- No problem.

948
00:54:15.382 --> 00:54:16.949
- Is he dead?

949
00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:19.256
- Emptied the clip.
Didn't miss once.

950
00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:22.171
What the hell is that?

951
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:29.483
Help me pick him up.

952
00:54:29.527 --> 00:54:31.746
- She's always got to be
touching something.

953
00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:34.009
- Lay him face down.
- Yeah.

954
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:38.753
What is that?

955
00:54:38.797 --> 00:54:40.364
- I don't know.

956
00:54:40.407 --> 00:54:42.496
- Is it actually
attached to him?

957
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.238
- I don't know.

958
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:47.719
- Hey. don't touch it.
- I wasn't going to.

959
00:54:47.762 --> 00:54:49.286
I just want...

960
00:54:53.202 --> 00:54:54.726
It's breathing.

961
00:54:55.161 --> 00:54:57.076
- Is it a parasite or something?

962
00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.389
Wait a minute.

963
00:55:06.128 --> 00:55:08.000
I've seen this guy before.

964
00:55:08.696 --> 00:55:10.263
- What? When?

965
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:13.701
- Churchill's friends
who died in the mine accident.

966
00:55:13.745 --> 00:55:15.312
Look at this.

967
00:55:15.573 --> 00:55:17.966
- Right. except for
this friend isn't dead.

968
00:55:18.532 --> 00:55:20.534
He hasn't aged.
Much.

969
00:55:21.143 --> 00:55:23.232
Which makes this thing
less of a parasite

970
00:55:23.276 --> 00:55:24.799
and more of a symbiont.

971
00:55:26.627 --> 00:55:28.194
- Right.

972
00:55:28.237 --> 00:55:30.414
But he's under some kind
of trance. or something.

973
00:55:30.457 --> 00:55:31.893
- It might be telepathic.

974
00:55:31.937 --> 00:55:33.460
- Or magic.

975
00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:37.464
But it's probably. uh.
telepathic.

976
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.524
What? What?

977
00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:55.134
Did you see something?

978
00:55:55.177 --> 00:55:57.266
It's what I don't see.

979
00:55:58.093 --> 00:56:00.574
- Oh. where did he go?

980
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.751
Okay. he-he was dead. right?

981
00:56:06.014 --> 00:56:07.538
- Yeah. he was dead.

982
00:56:07.581 --> 00:56:09.148
- Shit.

983
00:56:11.019 --> 00:56:12.543
- What is that?

984
00:56:16.895 --> 00:56:18.810
Dr. Nicolai?

985
00:56:21.203 --> 00:56:22.553
Come on.
- Wait.

986
00:56:23.162 --> 00:56:24.685
- What?
He could be injured.

987
00:56:24.729 --> 00:56:26.948
- Yeah. but how do you know
you can trust him?

988
00:56:26.992 --> 00:56:28.428
He's Russian.

989
00:56:28.472 --> 00:56:30.169
- He's a scientist.

990
00:56:30.212 --> 00:56:31.779
- Yeah. the worst
kind of Russians.

991
00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:36.088
- Come on.
Follow my lead.

992
00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:38.003
- Follow... Oh. goddammit.

993
00:56:48.927 --> 00:56:51.408
- I didn't know Hilly.
but now I do.

994
00:57:11.515 --> 00:57:13.081
- Ew.

995
00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:19.479
Whatever we're dealing with.

996
00:57:19.523 --> 00:57:21.655
it's more intelligent
than a simple animal.

997
00:57:21.699 --> 00:57:23.701
It seems to have
incredible strength

998
00:57:23.744 --> 00:57:25.224
and is very hard to kill.

999
00:57:25.267 --> 00:57:27.922
I'm Hunter Hazelton
and this is Channel 8 News.

1000
00:57:41.545 --> 00:57:42.807
- Hunter!

1001
00:57:57.909 --> 00:57:59.780
Come on!
- We can get him!

1002
00:57:59.824 --> 00:58:02.391
- What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

1003
00:58:02.435 --> 00:58:03.871
You saw what he's capable of.

1004
00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:04.959
- We can get him.

1005
00:58:05.003 --> 00:58:06.613
- He tried to kill us.

1006
00:58:06.657 --> 00:58:08.243
Now. you want to chase him
through a hole in the ground?

1007
00:58:08.267 --> 00:58:09.703
Hunter!
- He is getting away!

1008
00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:10.748
- Yes!

1009
00:58:10.791 --> 00:58:12.576
Yes. the pickaxe-wielding maniac

1010
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:15.274
with telepathic symbolism
is getting away!

1011
00:58:15.317 --> 00:58:17.145
This is a good thing.

1012
00:58:17.189 --> 00:58:19.017
Hunter!
- Let go.

1013
00:58:19.626 --> 00:58:21.541
This is what I do.
I chase.

1014
00:58:22.194 --> 00:58:23.674
- Make me understand
why I should

1015
00:58:23.717 --> 00:58:25.676
just let you run
off to your death.

1016
00:58:25.719 --> 00:58:28.243
- Because.
Don't you feel it?

1017
00:58:28.287 --> 00:58:29.680
- Feel what?

1018
00:58:29.723 --> 00:58:31.246
- Life.

1019
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.901
At some point.
everything starts to suck.

1020
00:58:33.945 --> 00:58:36.338
Your parents get older
and get sick.

1021
00:58:36.382 --> 00:58:39.341
Dreams that you have had
your entire life begin to fade.

1022
00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:41.039
or disappear completely.

1023
00:58:41.082 --> 00:58:44.477
replaced by whatever it is that
you're capable of accepting.

1024
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.481
- What does that
have to do with anything?

1025
00:58:49.438 --> 00:58:51.876
- I want to feel
that spark of magic.

1026
00:58:51.919 --> 00:58:55.183
of possibility.
of monsters and adventure.

1027
00:58:55.227 --> 00:58:56.881
Don't you feel it right now?

1028
00:58:57.272 --> 00:58:58.883
If you don't.

1029
00:58:59.318 --> 00:59:00.841
don't you want to?

1030
00:59:01.842 --> 00:59:03.540
- I'm scared. Hunter.

1031
00:59:05.977 --> 00:59:07.544
- Exactly.

1032
00:59:09.458 --> 00:59:10.982
You coming?

1033
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.943
- Wait up.

1034
00:59:15.987 --> 00:59:18.206
- Oh. and it was
telepathic symbiont.

1035
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.992
It was killing me
not to correct you back there.

1036
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.744
- What the hell is this?

1037
00:59:36.747 --> 00:59:38.313
Oh. god.

1038
00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:41.012
Oh. gross.

1039
00:59:41.969 --> 00:59:43.884
This stuff
is all over the place.

1040
00:59:52.153 --> 00:59:54.373
- Must be some kind of
incubation chamber.

1041
00:59:55.156 --> 00:59:57.550
- Incubation chamber?
Incubation chamber for what?

1042
01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:10.781
Are these eggs?

1043
01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:14.698
- Yeah. they're eggs.

1044
01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:16.961
- Ahh!

1045
01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:19.877
Fucking eggs!

1046
01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:23.184
Jesus. Fuck.

1047
01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:27.188
Uh. what was that?

1048
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.193
Uh. Cam?

1049
01:00:32.454 --> 01:00:33.978
What is that?

1050
01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:36.284
Where?

1051
01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:37.764
- Right there.
- Where?

1052
01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:39.592
- Right there.

1053
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.384
Um. you know karate. right?

1054
01:00:50.255 --> 01:00:52.300
- Why?
Because I'm Asian?

1055
01:00:52.997 --> 01:00:54.563
- Well...

1056
01:00:56.435 --> 01:00:57.958
Do you?

1057
01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:01.875
- Of course I know karate.

1058
01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:10.405
Oh. god! Oh. oh!

1059
01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:11.905
Oh. get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

1060
01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:13.234
- I can't!

1061
01:01:13.278 --> 01:01:15.106
- All right. stop!
Stop. stop. stop. stop!

1062
01:01:15.149 --> 01:01:17.021
Oh. oh. whoa.
Whoa.

1063
01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:18.936
Whoa. okay. um...

1064
01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:21.242
It's okay.
It's okay.

1065
01:01:21.286 --> 01:01:22.809
I just... I think it's. uh...

1066
01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:25.159
Oh.

1067
01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:27.161
Okay. it's attached
itself to my body.

1068
01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:30.687
Shh. shh. shh. shh.
It's okay. it's okay.

1069
01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.253
Uh...

1070
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.647
Just be honest.

1071
01:01:35.909 --> 01:01:37.476
How does it look?

1072
01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:41.959
- Uh.

1073
01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:46.920
Declan. look.

1074
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.228
Belong.

1075
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.587
- Declan. let's get outta here.

1076
01:02:04.808 --> 01:02:09.160
- Belong.

1077
01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:12.467
- Declan. easy.

1078
01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:13.773
Declan. it's me.

1079
01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:15.340
Easy. Easy.

1080
01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:16.863
Fuck it.

1081
01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:26.481
Oh. that felt a lot better
than it should've.

1082
01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:36.100
Shit.

1083
01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:38.450
- Belong.

1084
01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:52.681
- You're pretty good with a gun.

1085
01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:54.248
Where'd you learn to shoot?

1086
01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:57.121
- My dad. mostly.
Practiced at ranges.

1087
01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:58.775
I usually carry all the time.

1088
01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:00.472
except when I'm on assignments.

1089
01:03:00.515 --> 01:03:02.126
- Makes you feel safer?

1090
01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:04.345
- It's a really loud
rape whistle.

1091
01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:08.785
Hey. look!

1092
01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:10.351
There's an opening up ahead.

1093
01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:16.053
Carey.

1094
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.984
He killed himself.

1095
01:03:34.027 --> 01:03:35.812
- How long do you think
he's been here?

1096
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:37.248
- He's a knight
in shining armor.

1097
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.858
How many of those are left?

1098
01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.642
- Well. maybe without the armor.

1099
01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:43.820
Do you think that-

1100
01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:45.647
- That this could
lead us outta here?

1101
01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:47.301
- It's a worth a shot.

1102
01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:49.738
- Uh. how long
can you hold your breath?

1103
01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.523
- I guess we're about
to find out.

1104
01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:53.699
- Whoa!
Did that just happen?

1105
01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:56.267
- Football.
- Oh.

1106
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.659
- The list is long.

1107
01:03:57.703 --> 01:04:00.140
- Okay. um. just promise
you'll come back.

1108
01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:02.795
- What's this?

1109
01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.015
Do I sense a hint of symbiosis?

1110
01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:07.191
See?
I'm learning.

1111
01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:09.062
- You are just
full of surprises.

1112
01:04:09.106 --> 01:04:11.195
But. seriously.
you should have that checked.

1113
01:04:11.238 --> 01:04:12.413
- Yeah.

1114
01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:13.850
- Carey. wait.

1115
01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:20.465
Promise.

1116
01:04:20.508 --> 01:04:23.511
- I always break my promises.
so I won't make any.

1117
01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:26.732
Just wish me luck.

1118
01:04:32.564 --> 01:04:34.087
That'll do.

1119
01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:35.436
Flashlight?

1120
01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:40.093
Bye.

1121
01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:45.925
- Good luck.

1122
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:07.033
- There!

1123
01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:08.643
- What?

1124
01:05:08.687 --> 01:05:10.863
- I was able to scavenge
enough material

1125
01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.170
to assemble a portable
structural atom pulverizer

1126
01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:15.868
with rotating prism and recoil
adjusting power compensator

1127
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.739
with a cushioned grip.

1128
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.307
- What?

1129
01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:22.744
- I built an energy bomb.

1130
01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:27.880
You know. click. throw. kaboom!

1131
01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:29.795
- You made a bomb?

1132
01:05:29.838 --> 01:05:32.102
- Yeah. an energy bomb
to be more specific.

1133
01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:34.017
I had to figure out
how to harness

1134
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.410
some of the energy relay
in order to make it.

1135
01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:37.890
Wow.

1136
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.545
Great job.
Good for you.

1137
01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:43.287
Um. so can this
get us out of here?

1138
01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:46.333
- There's only one way
to find out.

1139
01:05:48.118 --> 01:05:50.076
Hey. guys!
- Took you long enough.

1140
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.339
Kennedy thinks
that she created a way to...

1141
01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.520
Hey. what are you holding?

1142
01:06:19.105 --> 01:06:20.672
- Hunter.

1143
01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:26.286
Hunter!

1144
01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:26.259
- Cam. Cam. help me.

1145
01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:28.218
Please.

1146
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:29.828
Cam?

1147
01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:33.832
Annie.

1148
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:35.573
Annie. you're not one of them.

1149
01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:36.791
- Shh.

1150
01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:38.115
- What do you think
you're doing?

1151
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.707
- Trying to blend in?

1152
01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:43.363
- Blend in? Help me.

1153
01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.626
- I'm sorry. that's not really
the best decision

1154
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.280
for me to make for myself.

1155
01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:49.171
Don't take it personally.
I hope you can understand.

1156
01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:51.154
- You're not the one
being tied to an altar.

1157
01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:53.721
- Are you comfortable? I can try
to make it comfortable.

1158
01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:56.898
- Ugh. I bet you wear pink and
change your social media picture

1159
01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:58.465
every time the mob tells you to.

1160
01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:00.293
- There's nothing wrong
with taking a stand.

1161
01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.078
There are many issues
worth standing up for.

1162
01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:04.167
like bullying. for example.

1163
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:07.126
- You are sacrificing me
to an ancient god.

1164
01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.389
- I'm sorry?

1165
01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:11.304
Shh! It's okay.

1166
01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:12.914
It'll all be over soon.

1167
01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:16.657
I never liked you.

1168
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.225
Oh. okay. I guess
we're going now.

1169
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:20.835
Bye. Be tasty.

1170
01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:22.924
- Annie.

1171
01:08:23.186 --> 01:08:24.752
Annie!

1172
01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:26.754
Somebody help me!

1173
01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:56.958
Hunter.

1174
01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.699
Come and see.

1175
01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:01.746
The past is the future.

1176
01:09:03.617 --> 01:09:05.706
The future is the past.

1177
01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:09.710
And so it goes

1178
01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:11.712
over and over

1179
01:09:12.278 --> 01:09:14.062
and over again.

1180
01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:29.050
Give yourself

1181
01:10:29.094 --> 01:10:30.617
to me.

1182
01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:40.627
The life.

1183
01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:42.760
He resists.

1184
01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.694
Hunter.
Hunter.

1185
01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:05.261
Hunter.

1186
01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:08.351
- What are you?

1187
01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:22.582
She will learn

1188
01:11:23.017 --> 01:11:25.846
her desire is to belong.

1189
01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:33.550
I want you to help me.

1190
01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:36.292
This world.

1191
01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:39.382
it will be mine once more.

1192
01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:41.906
She can be trusted.

1193
01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:45.126
- I won't help you.
- I told you.

1194
01:11:48.782 --> 01:11:53.918
You will help me.

1195
01:12:05.233 --> 01:12:07.018
What is this?

1196
01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:08.846
- It's us.

1197
01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:11.718
Do you remember this day?

1198
01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:13.503
- You looked at me
with that smile

1199
01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.548
and I thought I could
change the world.

1200
01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:17.550
I didn't change the world.

1201
01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:19.160
I didn't change anything.

1202
01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:22.033
You can still change
the world. Hunter.

1203
01:12:22.076 --> 01:12:23.730
You can help me do it.

1204
01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:26.342
Together.

1205
01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.344
Take my hand.

1206
01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:30.389
Be my goddess.

1207
01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:32.217
- What?

1208
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.914
- My little princess.

1209
01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:35.263
Mine.

1210
01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:36.700
- No.

1211
01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:38.528
This isn't real.

1212
01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:41.705
You're speaking as him
but you are not him.

1213
01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:43.837
- Hunter.
Honey.

1214
01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:47.319
I'm so proud of you.
Isn't that what you want?

1215
01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.453
- Get out of my head.

1216
01:12:50.496 --> 01:12:51.802
- Baby girl.

1217
01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:55.196
You belong to me.

1218
01:12:56.023 --> 01:12:57.547
- No.

1219
01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:04.031
- Get out of my head!

1220
01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:08.209
- Shh. shh. shh. shh.
It's okay. it's okay.

1221
01:13:08.253 --> 01:13:09.907
- You came back.
- Yeah.

1222
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.387
Oh!

1223
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.953
- You came back.

1224
01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:15.086
- I'm not sure where they went.
but we got to go now.

1225
01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:17.349
We can get out underwater.
We can swim out of here.

1226
01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.699
- Okay. Carey. that thing.
it communicated with me.

1227
01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:21.614
I saw things.
- What things?

1228
01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:23.747
- Death. Destruction.
An orgy.

1229
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.357
Okay. let's go.

1230
01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.750
- Orgy?

1231
01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:28.447
Wait. tell me more
about the orgy.

1232
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:30.057
- Come on.

1233
01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:37.456
- It's a long swim.
but I think we can make it.

1234
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.503
- Carey. thanks again so much
for coming back for me.

1235
01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.330
Don't sweat it. I-

1236
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:44.898
- Carey!
- It's got me!

1237
01:13:44.942 --> 01:13:47.466
- Give me your hand.
- Run!

1238
01:13:49.773 --> 01:13:51.252
- Carey!

1239
01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:47.657
Hunter.

1240
01:14:48.396 --> 01:14:50.834
come back to me.

1241
01:14:51.269 --> 01:14:53.358
You belong to me.

1242
01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:14.308
- Cam.

1243
01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:17.268
don't make me do this.

1244
01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:37.070
Cam. please.

1245
01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:03.314
- Whoa. whoa! Whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1246
01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:05.925
Hunter?

1247
01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:07.710
- Cam?

1248
01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:10.843
- I think it's letting go.

1249
01:17:10.887 --> 01:17:12.671
Try and get it off me.

1250
01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:14.455
- Okay.

1251
01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:40.699
- Hey. Hunter.

1252
01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:42.005
- Hey. Cam.

1253
01:17:42.048 --> 01:17:43.615
- Some story. huh?

1254
01:17:44.529 --> 01:17:46.052
Me without my camera.

1255
01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:53.277
Listen.

1256
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.279
it knows everything that we do.

1257
01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:57.890
Our deepest desires. our...

1258
01:17:58.325 --> 01:17:59.849
our fears.

1259
01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:01.633
And it wants out of this place.

1260
01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.330
And you can't let it.

1261
01:18:03.374 --> 01:18:06.551
- It was in my mind. too.
It showed me my father.

1262
01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:08.248
- Then you know...

1263
01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:10.468
You know you have to
finish this.

1264
01:18:10.511 --> 01:18:12.688
You can't let that thing
get outta here.

1265
01:18:14.037 --> 01:18:16.343
- I know. but how do I stop it?

1266
01:18:16.387 --> 01:18:18.955
- There's a weapon.
Kennedy made it.

1267
01:18:19.956 --> 01:18:21.522
It's at the cave-in site.

1268
01:18:22.393 --> 01:18:23.916
It's an energy bomb.

1269
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.092
and it's our only hope
at stopping it.

1270
01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:27.528
- I'll find it.

1271
01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:31.576
Cam.

1272
01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:33.926
It's okay.
It's okay.

1273
01:18:35.188 --> 01:18:36.799
- I'm dying. Hunter.

1274
01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:38.801
Don't leave me like this.

1275
01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:43.022
You know what you have to do.

1276
01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:47.070
- I can't do it.

1277
01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:49.986
- Hunter.

1278
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:54.338
you are the
strongest person I know.

1279
01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:09.092
- I love you. Cam.

1280
01:20:10.283 --> 01:20:12.851
Mr. Hazelton.
do you have any last words

1281
01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:14.940
you'd like to share with us
about your daughter?

1282
01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:16.681
- We don't want to talk to you.

1283
01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:18.248
- Last words?

1284
01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:19.945
What the hell's wrong with you?!

1285
01:20:21.077 --> 01:20:22.643
I'll tell you something.

1286
01:20:22.687 --> 01:20:24.210
My daughter. Hunter.

1287
01:20:24.254 --> 01:20:25.821
she's a survivor.

1288
01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:27.387
She's gonna fight.

1289
01:20:27.431 --> 01:20:30.173
She's gonna find
her way out of that damn mine.

1290
01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:33.045
And then you'll see.

1291
01:20:33.089 --> 01:20:35.526
She's gonna make me
and the whole country proud.

1292
01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:37.658
just like she always does.

1293
01:20:37.702 --> 01:20:39.617
'cause my baby girl
doesn't know the meaning

1294
01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.184
of the word quit.

1295
01:20:41.227 --> 01:20:45.753
Now get the fuck off my lawn.
you goddamn parasite.

1296
01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:52.630
- Obviously. a tense situation.

1297
01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:55.328
Next up. we go live
to talk with the family

1298
01:20:55.372 --> 01:20:56.895
of Russian scientist
Alek Nicolai.

1299
01:21:04.903 --> 01:21:06.774
- Leave my friend alone.

1300
01:22:29.205 --> 01:22:31.120
Who knew that would
come in handy?

1301
01:23:06.503 --> 01:23:08.331
Shh! What are you
doing here?

1302
01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:11.029
- I escaped. I was looking
for a way out.

1303
01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:12.465
You have to help me.

1304
01:23:12.509 --> 01:23:14.206
- Help you? You tried
to sacrifice me

1305
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.816
like. five minutes ago.

1306
01:23:16.426 --> 01:23:17.993
- I've changed?

1307
01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:19.951
I've seen the error of my ways.

1308
01:23:20.169 --> 01:23:21.474
Um.

1309
01:23:22.127 --> 01:23:23.824
You're a good person?

1310
01:23:23.868 --> 01:23:26.175
- Fuck you.
- I deserve that.

1311
01:23:26.566 --> 01:23:29.047
- Fine. follow me.
but keep your mouth shut.

1312
01:23:29.091 --> 01:23:30.440
We need to find Carey

1313
01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:32.616
and then we can escape
through the back.

1314
01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:40.058
- There can only be only one
queen of the world.

1315
01:23:40.102 --> 01:23:41.929
Hunter Hazelton.

1316
01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:43.888
And it was never gonna be you.

1317
01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:46.804
Pick her up.
Let's get this over with.

1318
01:23:47.718 --> 01:23:49.241
Now!

1319
01:23:53.854 --> 01:23:55.378
It's a slight improvement.

1320
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:01.645
Hunter.

1321
01:24:03.647 --> 01:24:05.388
- Carey?
- Are you okay?

1322
01:24:06.476 --> 01:24:08.521
Yeah.

1323
01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:14.049
- Hm.

1324
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.053
They are yours to do with
as you please. oh. great one.

1325
01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:19.576
- Annie.

1326
01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:21.578
what are you doing?

1327
01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:24.363
- Oh. you're not the only
smart one here. Hunter.

1328
01:24:24.407 --> 01:24:25.973
I read the hieroglyphics. too.

1329
01:24:26.017 --> 01:24:28.933
This thing needs a sacrifice
to keep it in check.

1330
01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:32.023
And by my count. I have
two sacrifices right here.

1331
01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:34.504
- She's talking about us. right?

1332
01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:37.246
- When you rejected its offer.

1333
01:24:37.289 --> 01:24:39.117
what did you think
was gonna happen?

1334
01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:41.989
That it would just stop
because Hunter Hazelton said no?

1335
01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:44.122
Of course it's not gonna stop.

1336
01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:46.342
It found someone better.

1337
01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:48.909
Someone more worthy
of being its emissary.

1338
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.653
Me.

1339
01:25:03.185 --> 01:25:04.708
Mm.

1340
01:25:06.405 --> 01:25:08.538
Oh. great and powerful

1341
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:10.757
Octopus God.

1342
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:13.630
behold the gifts
I have brought for thee.

1343
01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.501
- Annie. why?

1344
01:25:15.545 --> 01:25:17.112
- Why?

1345
01:25:17.721 --> 01:25:19.810
Easy.
One: Survival.

1346
01:25:19.853 --> 01:25:21.420
Two: Queen of the
fucking world.

1347
01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:23.030
Three:
Eternal youth.

1348
01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:24.704
You know. I don't know how
you turned all that down.

1349
01:25:24.728 --> 01:25:26.599
- Yeah. that last one
is pretty cool.

1350
01:25:26.643 --> 01:25:29.167
- And on top of it all.
I get an army

1351
01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:30.884
of brainwashed slaves to control
with the deal.

1352
01:25:30.908 --> 01:25:32.431
Well. Declan was
already halfway there.

1353
01:25:32.475 --> 01:25:34.346
but you know what I mean.

1354
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:38.176
- Annie. do you really think
you can appease a giant monster?

1355
01:25:44.443 --> 01:25:46.532
- I guess we're about to
find out.

1356
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:50.292
- Hunter. look at me.

1357
01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:52.859
Look at me.

1358
01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:56.820
Don't be afraid.

1359
01:27:09.093 --> 01:27:12.879
- Annie. that is the second time
you tried to sacrifice me today.

1360
01:27:14.403 --> 01:27:15.969
- Once you do it the first time.

1361
01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:18.320
it is infinitely easier
the second time around.

1362
01:27:19.016 --> 01:27:20.539
You had your chance. Hunter.

1363
01:27:20.583 --> 01:27:23.281
and like always.
you just weren't good enough.

1364
01:27:24.195 --> 01:27:25.718
- We'll see.

1365
01:27:26.023 --> 01:27:29.113
We'll see how smart
your ancient deity really is.

1366
01:27:32.638 --> 01:27:34.118
Do you know what this is?

1367
01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:36.120
- Hunter. what are you doing?

1368
01:27:38.949 --> 01:27:40.603
- You know what she knows.

1369
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:43.954
You do know this is bad news.

1370
01:27:45.347 --> 01:27:47.174
- Hunter. you're ruining
everything.

1371
01:27:47.218 --> 01:27:48.785
I've got this under control.

1372
01:27:48.828 --> 01:27:51.048
- You let me and my friend go.

1373
01:27:51.091 --> 01:27:55.008
or I press this button
and everything ends.

1374
01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:00.884
- Oh.

1375
01:28:00.927 --> 01:28:02.364
- Smart girl.

1376
01:28:02.407 --> 01:28:04.322
Hunter. what are you doing?

1377
01:28:04.366 --> 01:28:06.890
- Exerting my dominance.
Hopefully.

1378
01:28:06.933 --> 01:28:08.457
Come on. let's go.

1379
01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.286
- No. wait. Where are you going?
You can't leave.

1380
01:28:11.677 --> 01:28:13.549
You can't leave here without me.

1381
01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:20.077
Oh. no. no. I was just kidding.

1382
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.122
I would never leave you. baby.

1383
01:28:29.565 --> 01:28:31.131
Please.

1384
01:28:31.175 --> 01:28:33.090
- We can't leave her like this.

1385
01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:35.701
- I know.

1386
01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:41.925
You're welcome.

1387
01:28:43.013 --> 01:28:44.884
Come on. let's go.

1388
01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:53.893
Oh.
