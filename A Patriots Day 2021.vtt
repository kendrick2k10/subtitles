Brandon. would you stand please?

26
00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:42.147
"And if you're ever feeling scared.

"I will be right there by your side."

28
00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:46.365
- Dad.

29
00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.350

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.500
- IAD?

32
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.973
- A boy in my class said his
uncle was killed by an IAD.

33
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.903
- Oh.

34
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.017
You mean IED.

35
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.380
It's a homemade explosive
used by the bad guys.

36
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.580
- Will they use one on you?

37
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.103
- Your dad is gonna be really safe.

38
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.740
And I'm gonna have a
lot of people around me

39
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.423
helping keep everyone safe.

40
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.870
It's really important that you know that.

41
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.300
I'm going because I want to serve.

42
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.873
I want to serve my country.

43
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.113
- You know. it's only hitting me just now.

44
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.840
I knew this moment would
come. but I just can't.

45
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.653
- Hey. hey.

46
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.093
I'm gonna come back.

47
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.520
I really believe that this is
what God has called me to do.

48
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.840
And I can't explain how.

49
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.490
but I know he's gonna protect me.

50
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.243
Oh ten-hut. hut. hut. hut.

51
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.223
Where's my bunk?

52
00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:28.573
I have no idea.

53
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.340
What's up. dawg?
- What's up?

54
00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:36.702

55
00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:41.310
What is this?

56
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.870
Take that horse crap off.

57
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.793
Suck it up.

58
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.940
What?

59
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.330
What is this?

60
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.830
Are you opening a candy
store. what are you doing?

61
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.900
What is this?

62
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.250
It's what I
have. Drill Sergeant.

63
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.580
- What. are you laughing at me?

64
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.413
- No. Drill Sergeant.

65
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:02.546
- Do you find something funny. son?

66
00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:04.620
- No. Drill Sergeant.

67
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.300
- You know what I find funny?

68
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.010
You brought a tub.

69
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.440
You are Tubby.

70
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.643
That's it. Tubby.

71
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.710
And you. were you in a motorcycle gang?

72
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.500
- No. Drill Sergeant.
- You're pretty boy.

73
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.456
You're pretty boy.

74
00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:18.606
Get that off your head.

75
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.292
What is this. huh?

76
00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:22.459
Whose is this?

77
00:05:23.578 --> 00:05:25.323
Who?
- Mine. Drill Sergeant.

78
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.293
- What is this?

79
00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:29.463
- The Bible. Drill Sergeant.

80
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.298
Preacher. that's you.

81
00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.131
- Yes. Drill Sergeant.

82
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:34.283

- Yes. Drill Sergeant.

86
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.503
What a mess. what a mess.

87
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.910
What are we gonna do with this?

88
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.550
You believe in this?

89
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.770
- Yes. Drill Sergeant.

90
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.403
- Turn to Jeremiah 5:20.

91
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.147
Read it.

92
00:06:06.147 --> 00:06:08.140
- "You are my war club.
my weapon for battle."

93
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.973
- Louder.

94
00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.300
- "You are my war club.
my weapon for battle."

95
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.133
Louder.

96
00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:14.437
- "You on my war club.
my weapon for battle.

97
00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:16.087
"With you. I shatter nations.

98
00:06:16.087 --> 00:06:18.027
"With you. I destroy kingdoms."

99
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.883
- Kingdoms. gentlemen.

100
00:06:19.883 --> 00:06:21.810
We're gonna destroy kingdoms. right?

101
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.320
Sir. yes. Sir.

102
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.120
- Put that in your locker. Preacher.

103
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.650
- Do you believe in God?

104
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.578
- God?

105
00:06:48.578 --> 00:06:49.993
Yeah. man.

106
00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.326
- Yeah. I guess.

107
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.420
- Hey. preacher. why
don't you read us a story.

108
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.700
help pass the time. huh?

109
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.383
- This one's from Philippians 4:13.

110
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:06.507
"I can do all things in
Christ. who gives me strength."

111
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.030
- You're gonna need some of that strength

112
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.330
to get old Tubby over that wall outside.

113
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.700
- Yeah. yeah. all right. very funny.

114
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.352
Come on. let's go.

115
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.843
- Go. get up. get up. again.

116
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:20.118
Get down.

117
00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:21.294
Down.

118
00:07:21.294 --> 00:07:22.985
Up. down.

119
00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:23.818

Tubby. down. up.

121
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.610
Stay. I said stay up.

Get up. down.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.253
Up. down.

124
00:07:31.253 --> 00:07:33.022
Up. get it moving.

125
00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:34.306
- Come on. Tubby. you got it.

126
00:07:34.306 --> 00:07:35.153
- Get down. get down. go.

127
00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.272
Tubby. move. next room.

128
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.527
What is your goal?

129
00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:50.270
- Might as well pass this.

130
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.103
- Hey.

131
00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:53.425
- I got you.

132
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.810
- And for the man.

133
00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:59.495
- Oh and it's still hot.

134
00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:00.328
- You're like his best friend.

135
00:08:00.328 --> 00:08:01.161
- I'm listening guys.

136
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.892
- Hey listen. I like Tootsie Roll.

137
00:08:02.892 --> 00:08:04.970
- Homemade chocolate.

138
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.821
Watch this.

139
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:06.654
- With a Tootsie Roll?

140
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.487
- With a Tootsie Roll. yes.

141
00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.995
- He does this all the time. believe me.

142
00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:12.310
- You hear something.

143
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.883
take it out of the paper.

144
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.039
Swirl it.

145
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.793
I have never seen
this before my entire life.

146
00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:22.219
You can be at that for hours

147
00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:23.052
if you want that to be chocolate.

148
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.090
I'm just so exhausted here.

149
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.630
I really miss you.

150
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.463
Make sure the kids know

151
00:08:31.463 --> 00:08:34.042
I miss being at their soccer games. okay.

152
00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:35.030
Hey Daddy.

153
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.220
- Hey sweetie. happy birthday.

154
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.390
How was the party?

155
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.520
- It was good.

156
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.530
We took a lot of pictures
for mama to send you.

157
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.880
- Oh that's great.

158
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.050
I really wish I could have been there.

159
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.505
- I got this new doll. her name is Lily.

160
00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:53.470
Then I also got this bike
helmet. the bikes outside.

161
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.958
but I can show you that later.

162
00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.390
And I got this book "A Little Princess."

163
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.110
I've been reading it to myself

164
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.600
and I'm on chapter three
and it's a great book.

165
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.430
And I love it.

166
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.990
- Why don't you let me talk to
daddy for a little bit. okay.

167
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.900
- Okay.

168
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.820
Bye Daddy. love you.

169
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.993
- Yeah. I love you.

170
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.220
- Hi Honey.

171
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.420
Oh. you look tired.

172
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.950
- Yeah I am.

173
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.560
Last night we went on a 3:00 a.m. run

174
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.233
then we went back to bed.

175
00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:21.430
- Yeah.

176
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.550
- Listen. I have a pretty good idea

177
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.700
of where they're sending
me when we finish.

178
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.040
I'll be rolling into
deployment like we thought.

179
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.550
I don't know what
communication's gonna be like

180
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.163
at that point. I'll try to stay in touch.

181
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:40.610
- I want you to know how proud I am of you

182
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.100
and how proud your father would be too.

183
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.933
- Thanks.

184
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.720
So tell me more about life back there.

185
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.553
Anything new with.

186
00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:49.720
Hurry up Preacher.

187
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.200
- Hey. I just sat down.

188
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.600
- Preacher.

189
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.389
- Yeah. Drill Sergeant's nickname for me.

190
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:58.550
It's kind of caught on with the guys too.

191
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.140
I don't know if it's the fear
of war or the lack of sleep.

192
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.100
most everyone here wants
to know more about God.

193
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.410
- Well. do you think I
could send some bibles?

194
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.230
- Yeah. yeah. that'd be great.

195
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.063
I'd rather have the computer.

196
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.200
- Ah. listen honey. I
better go. I love you.

197
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.050
- I love you too.

198
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.570
Hey Preacher. I
couldn't help overhearing.

199
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.860
you told your wife you're
getting sent to the war.

200
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.755
- That's the rumor. isn't it?

201
00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:30.500
Well. yeah. but
that's just. it. it's a rumor.

202
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.950
there's nothing official yet.

203
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.940
- Look. if it turns out to be wrong.

204
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.390
I'll gladly call her back
and tell her the good news.

205
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.420
But until then. I don't
want to give her false hope.

206
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.000
Sometimes it helps to
prepare for the worst.

207
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.320
Sounds pretty
cynical for the bible guy.

208
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.150
- Yeah. well. God doesn't
promise to do everything

209
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.860
the way we'd want him to.

210
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.910
All right. well
then what does he promise.

211
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.810
My wife's praying for me to stay safe.

212
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.760
You think she should just give that up?

213
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.613
- Oh leave it alone. Tubby.

214
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.600
If you wanted a guarantee of staying safe.

215
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.600
you really chose the wrong line of work.

216
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.907
Fair enough. Captain.

217
00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:21.871
- Chris.

218
00:11:24.562 --> 00:11:25.395
Chris.

219
00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:27.387
- What's up?

220
00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:29.065
- What's up man?

221
00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:30.341
- Chilling. chilling.

222
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:31.980
- How you doing?

223
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.230
- Hey.

224
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.063
- Yeah.

225
00:11:35.274 --> 00:11:37.303
- You know they sending us tomorrow right?

226
00:11:39.276 --> 00:11:42.470
- Yeah. yeah.

227
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.342
You okay?

228
00:11:43.342 --> 00:11:44.301
- I'm good. I'm good.

229
00:11:44.301 --> 00:11:45.134
I'm just.

230
00:11:48.128 --> 00:11:50.400
You know I love you right?

231
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.365
Yeah.

232
00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:54.007
What you talking about?

233
00:11:54.007 --> 00:11:55.032
- Just wanted to tell you.

234
00:11:55.032 --> 00:11:55.865
tell you I love you.

235
00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.901
- I love you too man.

236
00:11:57.901 --> 00:11:58.734
You okay?

237
00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:00.484
- I'm okay. I'm good.

238
00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:32.997
And Al-Qaeda
terrorists trained men.

239
00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:36.668
In Afghanistan.

240
00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:18.993
- You know. I feel like I'm going crazy.

241
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.500
It's been two years and I
still. in the morning. rollover

242
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.340
and I go to say something
to him and he's not there.

243
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.670
- Have you heard any more news?

244
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.120
- Any more news?

245
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.250
I've heard no news.

246
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.250
It's. "Call this number."

247
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.627
Where's my husband?

248
00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:45.270
"Call this number."

249
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.807
Can I get ahold of my husband?

250
00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:48.500
"Call this number?"

251
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.327
Is he alive?

252
00:13:50.327 --> 00:13:51.747
"Call this number."

253
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.218
I get it.

254
00:13:57.218 --> 00:14:00.363
I get it. it's war. but
I need to know something.

255
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.520
- We're still praying for him.

256
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.330

00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:07.369
- Oh.

00:16:07.369 --> 00:16:08.340
Oh please God. please.

273
00:16:13.685 --> 00:16:14.518
Hello.

284
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.710
And we're so happy to have him back.

285
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.274
Please stand Sergeant Brandon Williams.

286
00:19:40.643 --> 00:19:42.393

- Thank you.

289

Every third.
Wednesday of the month.

290
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.550
I gotta come up here to the VA

291
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.093
and talk to an expert about my feelings.

292
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.883
All I really want is for
someone to listen to me.

293
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.070
That's not what happens.

294
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.763
Instead you go in there.
you pour your heart out.

295
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.870
And what they do is they
type on their computer.

296
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.693
print out some prescription
and they send you off.

297
00:20:26.857 --> 00:20:27.690
They don't care.

298
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.213
They're not even listening.

299
00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.112
This way. that way.

300
00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:42.695
This way.

301
00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:46.229
There you go.

302
00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.853
- Hey.

303
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.680
Can I get a round for the guys.

304
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.513
- Sure thing.

305
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.244
- Did Dallas win?

306
00:22:14.244 --> 00:22:15.494
- I don't know.

307
00:22:16.704 --> 00:22:18.210
- Look at it there.

308
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.423
I had him two to one.

309
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.753
- New member?

310
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.153
- I don't know.

311
00:22:26.153 --> 00:22:29.010
I just thought. I served in Afghanistan.

312
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.953
- Oh I can tell.

313
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.390
Fourth Infantry Division.

314
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.393
- Air Force retired.

315
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.443
- You guys just finished
a parade or something?

316
00:22:48.297 --> 00:22:50.750
- You wanna join us?

317
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.847
- I just kind of want to be. you know?

318
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.143
- Well.

Everybody get down.

323
00:23:25.092 --> 00:23:27.690
- Brandon. Brandon. it's okay.

324
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.780

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.800
- Tom. stop. what happened?

326
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.040
- I been following him for miles.

327
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.510
he swerving all over the road.

328
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.670
- Okay. I'm sorry. he's sorry.

329
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.560
he doesn't know what he's doing.

330
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.750
He's all messed up right now.

331
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.900
A warning. couldn't you
please just give me a chance

332
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:47.733
to talk to him?

333
00:23:47.733 --> 00:23:49.883
He's going through so
much Tom. you know that.

334
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.083
- I'll tell you what. if he's
serious about getting help.

335
00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.204
have him give me a call.

336
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.780
- Thank you.

337
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.800
- Because he's gonna kill somebody

338
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.600
unless we get this straightened out.

339
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.023
- Hey. maybe after the
game we can go for a walk?

340
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.560
- Yeah. a walk is good.

341
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.420
- Amber. sweetie. did you tell your daddy

342
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.800

- Camp?

344
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.930

- Well yeah.

348
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.010
- Absolutely not.

349
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:44.843
- Dad.

350
00:24:44.843 --> 00:24:45.920
Honey. you're way too young

351
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.414
to be going off to the woods with whoever.

352
00:24:47.414 --> 00:24:49.230
- It's with the church.

353
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.486
I don't care who it's with.

354
00:24:50.486 --> 00:24:51.319
- Mom.

355
00:24:51.319 --> 00:24:53.480
- It's okay. honey. we'll
talk about it later.

356
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.840
- We just talked about it.

357
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.150
The answer is no.

358
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.124
And what are you doing with a phone?

359
00:24:57.124 --> 00:24:58.592
What eight year old has a phone?

360
00:24:58.592 --> 00:24:59.509
Gimme that.

361
00:25:27.863 --> 00:25:32.863

00:25:51.534 --> 00:25:56.534

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.221
- What brings you to Texas?

367
00:26:32.221 --> 00:26:34.470
You from around here?

368
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:39.470
- No. my wife was pregnant with my son

369
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:40.717
when I was in Afghanistan

370
00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:43.283
and then decided she
wanted to be with her ex.

371
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.183
Took my son to Tahoe and my dog.

372
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.170
Took everything that I
had spent three tours

373
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.520
going up to the house with.

374
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.653
All my money in my bank account gone.

375
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.730
I'm on my way back to Kentucky
to be close to my son.

376
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.600
But nothing.

377
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.950
Coal trucks. coal mines.
drugs and alcohol back there.

378
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.520
My buddy told me to stay at
his house down here Texas

379
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.120
and that didn't work out either.

380
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.517
- Yeah. can you tell me
that your time overseas.

381
00:27:20.517 --> 00:27:23.523
Did you ever feel like
you saw the explosion

382
00:27:23.523 --> 00:27:25.150
and the tracer rounds coming?

383
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.053
- Hey. I'm gonna stop you there.

384
00:27:28.456 --> 00:27:29.430
I don't talk about that stuff man.

385
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.653
- Yeah. there was one time
that we were in this camp.

386
00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:32.794
- Look man. I asked you.

387
00:27:32.794 --> 00:27:34.670
- Just came in so fast and it started.

388
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.200
- All right.

389
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.390
I appreciate what you're doing. man.

390
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.913
I really do. but I'm not into
the whole counseling bit.

391
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.683
- Adam. wait.

392
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.260
Sorry for pushing you. man.

393
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:55.640
Listen. love to have
you over for a hot meal.

394
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.390
take a hot shower.

395
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.593
We can throw a ball game on
and just hang out. two Vets.

396
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.460
- You gonna eat that burger?

397
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.270
- Take it man. it's all yours.

398
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.203
- Maybe.

399
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.063
Thank you.

400
00:28:31.727 --> 00:28:33.010
Tubby. you got the rear?

401
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.607
- Yeah. I got it.

402
00:28:34.607 --> 00:28:36.593
Gamma. go
pull security on rear.

403
00:28:36.593 --> 00:28:37.917
Alpha. we got inventory.

404
00:28:37.917 --> 00:28:40.318
Let's move.

405
00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:42.528
We got a live one.

406
00:28:42.528 --> 00:28:45.945
Take him. take him. take him.

407
00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:10.218
- Who are you?

408
00:29:23.931 --> 00:29:25.751
- Hey. good to see you.
- Hey.

409
00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:27.183
Yeah.

410
00:29:27.183 --> 00:29:31.095
I am sorry to just come by like this.

411
00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:32.370
If you wanna do a different day.

412
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.770
- No. it's fine. come on in.

413
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.750
- You sure?

414
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.730
- Absolutely. come on.

415
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.563
Honey. look who it is.

416
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.463
- Oh. hi. hi. I'm Nancy. nice to meet you.

417
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.573
Come on in.

418
00:29:52.021 --> 00:29:52.854
- Come on.

419
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.830
- You know what. let me go
get Amber. she's outside.

420
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.140
- That's a good idea.

421
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.360
- Oh yeah. you can meet my daughter.

422
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.193
- Daughter.

423
00:30:04.323 --> 00:30:05.880
You didn't tell me you had a daughter.

424
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.270
How old is she?

425
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.623
I might send her.

426
00:30:08.623 --> 00:30:10.770
- She's eight going on 15.

427
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.170
Don't worry. you'll be fine.

428
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.281
- Well. any case you have
a bathroom or something.

429
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:19.660
where I can freshen up?

430
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.493
- Oh. I'm sorry. yeah.

431
00:30:20.493 --> 00:30:22.370
it's right down there to
the right. help yourself.

432
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.203
- Sure.

433
00:30:44.156 --> 00:30:45.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

434
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:45.893
- Where's Adam.

435
00:30:45.893 --> 00:30:48.240
- Oh he's in the bathroom.
he'll be right back.

436
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.073
- Okay.

437
00:30:50.396 --> 00:30:51.229
- Honey.

438
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.012
Don't worry. he's a good guy.

439
00:30:54.012 --> 00:30:55.002
- I know.

440
00:30:55.002 --> 00:30:58.130
I just wish you would have
told me he was coming.

441
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.950
- Well. I didn't even know he was coming.

442
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.483
I mean. I invited him. but.

443
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.090
Look. he's been through a lot

444
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.423
and he doesn't have anyone
to help him like I do.

445
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.995
- Oh. oh Adam.

446
00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:22.740
Please take a seat. I'm
gonna get dinner started.

447
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.240
- Yeah. man. come one.
gives us more time to talk.

448
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.423
- Hi. I'm Amber. nice to meet you.

449
00:31:37.712 --> 00:31:38.545
- Hi.

450
00:31:39.577 --> 00:31:41.220
- Where do you live?

451
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.222
- Amber.

452
00:31:42.222 --> 00:31:43.055
What?

453
00:31:43.055 --> 00:31:44.663
- No. it's all right.

454
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Well I guess the easiest
way to explain that is.

455
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.313
outside.

456
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.850
It's kinda like camping. every night.

457
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.113
I get to look at the
stars. look for planets.

458
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.290
lightening bugs. crickets and birds

459
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.890
and listen to them all nice.

460
00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.023
It's pretty cool.

461
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.687
- I wish I could go camping.

462
00:32:15.687 --> 00:32:17.630
- Maybe your dad will take you one day.

463
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.060
- I was supposed to go to
church camp this summer

464
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.709
but dad says I can't go.

465
00:32:22.709 --> 00:32:25.472
- Hey. we said. we'll talk about it.

466
00:32:25.472 --> 00:32:27.600
- We said. we'll talk about it?

467
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.630
You said no.
- Well.

468
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.820
I'm still thinking about it.

469
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.913
- Why your dad's just
trying to protect you.

470
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.400
Hey. my dad did the same thing to me.

471
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.260
I was your age. we had this big
tree in the backyard. right.

472
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.860
and I wanted to climb it so bad.

473
00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.650
dad didn't want me to
get hurt. told me not to.

474
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.060
I came home from school one day

475
00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.590
and he was late getting home from work.

476
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.757
You know what I did?

477
00:32:52.757 --> 00:32:53.820
- You climbed the tree.

478
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.809
- All the way to the top. all the way.

479
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:59.500
But I was too scared once I got up there.

480
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.560
I couldn't get back down.

481
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.750
- Then how'd you get down?

482
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.770
- The easiest way possible. I fell.

483
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.650
Hit most of the branches
on the way down too.

484
00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.470
I didn't break any bones or anything.

485
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.000
but my dad didn't have any trouble

486
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.943
keeping me out of the tree after that.

487
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:07.722
- No. seriously thank
you guys for everything.

488
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.530
- Absolutely. it was our pleasure.

489
00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.750
- Hey. the offer still stands.

490
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.593
you sure you don't want to stay the night?

491
00:34:25.643 --> 00:34:26.645
- I'm good.

492
00:34:26.645 --> 00:34:28.837
I got it. I'm okay. thank you.

493
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.800
- Anytime.
- Bye.

494
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.383
Have you been
gonna those meetings with Tom?

495
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.653
- I missed the last one.

496
00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:14.833
- And the one before that.

497
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.677
Have you been going to any at all?

498
00:35:26.973 --> 00:35:29.530
- Listen.
- No. you listen Gary.

499
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.670
you can't keep doing this.

500
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.020
It's not good for the kids.

501
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.127
- I'm trying to stay away from them.

502
00:35:36.127 --> 00:35:36.960
- What?

503
00:35:37.884 --> 00:35:40.128
No. that's not what they want.

504
00:35:40.128 --> 00:35:42.800
Gary. they don't want you
to stay away from them.

505
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.680
We miss you.

506
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.363
We want you to be with us.

507
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.453
Fight for us.

508
00:35:50.343 --> 00:35:52.033
like You fought for our country.

509
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.143
Is it too much to ask you to
come to the game next week?

510
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.890
It's the first of the playoffs.

511
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.903
Could you at least call
Tom about the meetings?

512
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.187
It might actually help.
- Listen. I'll go.

513
00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.323
I'll go to the game next week.

514
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.440
- It wasn't like a charm
or anything to protect us.

515
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:36.353
It was just a reminder
that God was with us.

516
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.830
- Whatever you gotta do to get through it.

517
00:36:42.846 --> 00:36:43.770
- Oh. I'm sorry.

518
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.850
I know you didn't want
to talk about this stuff.

519
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.650
Can I ask you if you believe in God?

520
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.163
- You could ask. but I couldn't say.

521
00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.690
I mean. I've had moments

522
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.690
where everything's just falling
into place and I thank God.

523
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.303
Like most people would say. I guess.

524
00:37:11.827 --> 00:37:13.293
I've had other times where.

525
00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:20.580
I swear it was like. God
was just out to kill me.

526
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.593
I guess what you call God. I call luck.

527
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.773
It's not predictable.

528
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.513
it doesn't discriminate.

529
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.360
it doesn't care about anyone

530
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.187
or anything it touches or breaks.

531
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.703
What's that picture up there. man?

532
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.173
- My squad. second tour in Afghanistan.

533
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.823
See that guy third from the right?

534
00:38:17.085 --> 00:38:20.310
- Yeah.

535
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.160
- That was Mikey.

536
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:23.833
Amazing man.

537
00:38:26.925 --> 00:38:29.173
He had a beautiful wife. three kids.

538
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.743
One night. we were out on a night patrol.

539
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.393
we were ambushed from all sides.

540
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.593
Somehow I found some cover.

541
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.823
Mikey didn't.

542
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.010
- Everything in this
world is black and white.

543
00:38:57.267 --> 00:39:02.033
Everything is either good or evil.

544
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.990
Nobody realizes that they've
seen the things we've seen

545
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.673
and done the things that we've done.

546
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.900
I was in the Shah Joy District

547
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.343
in the Zabul Province of Afghanistan.

548
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:35.390
that night we went on patrol
and I stepped on an IED.

549
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.330
It coulda killed everybody.

550
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.420
I'm not a bomb maker. I
don't know what happened.

551
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.460
but it went off but it didn't explode.

552
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.713
We were you're just covered at HME powder.

553
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.690
And so many guys that have lost.

554
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.620
that had wives and kids
and dogs and families

555
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.220
and the rest of the rest
of their life to live

556
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.093
and I shoulda died over there man.

557
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.853
- Hey.

558
00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.570
Maybe the fact that the IED didn't explode

559
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.853
means God has a bigger
purpose for your life.

560
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.393
A second chance.

561
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:30.200
And I'm sure that us
meeting was no accident.

562
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.670
You sound like a preacher man.

563
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.574
- Well. that's what they
called me in the army.

564
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.500
If you wanna hear
someone. who's way better.

565
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.080
you should come to our church tomorrow.

566
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.230
Everyone there would
love to have you. man.

567
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.963
No pressure.

568
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.093
it's just an offer.

569
00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:02.830
- In recent weeks. we've
examined the themes of courage.

570
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.760
love and sacrifice. as
seen in the life of Jesus.

571
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.760
As I've said. in many ways.
Jesus was like a soldier.

572
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.460
This world was enemy
territory that he entered into

573
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.793
knowing what would happen to him.

574
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:25.250
But he gave his life. not
only for those who loved him.

575
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.440
but for those who hated him.

576
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.273
including the very ones who
nailed him to the cross.

577
00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:33.920
Think about that.

578
00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.047
Paul writes in Romans 5.

579
00:41:39.047 --> 00:41:42.427
"Very rarely will anyone
die for a righteous person

580
00:41:42.427 --> 00:41:44.437
"though for a good person.

581
00:41:44.437 --> 00:41:47.897
"someone might possibly dare to die.

582
00:41:47.897 --> 00:41:51.223
"But God demonstrates his
own love for us in this.

583
00:41:52.117 --> 00:41:57.057
"While we were still
sinners. Christ died for us."

584
00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.133
But the story doesn't end there. does it?

585
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.740
On the third day after his death.

586
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.440
Jesus rose again.

587
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.760
And what that means is that
we can be raised to new life.

588
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.580
forgiven our sins and made right with God.

589
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.880
If we simply turn to him in faith.

590
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.020
turn away from our sins and trust in Jesus

591
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.450
instead of ourselves

592
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.313
and God will heal us no
matter how broken we are.

593
00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:23.247
- Hey. your right. in your right.

594
00:44:04.267 --> 00:44:05.100
- Clear.

595
00:44:06.691 --> 00:44:08.943
- Keep it together
Tubby. keep it together.

596
00:44:08.943 --> 00:44:13.943
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Okay.

597
00:44:26.534 --> 00:44:27.600
- Hey sweetie. what are you doing?

598
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.900
- I'm baking cookies for the picnic.

599
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.220
- I see that.

600
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.980
And that's a great thought.

601
00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.580
but why don't you let
Mommy take over from here

602
00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.200
and then you can help me frost them.

603
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.140
- I hope Adam's gonna love these.

604
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.620
- I know he will have those.

605
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.532
Let me do this and.

606
00:44:45.525 --> 00:44:47.175
You're getting it all over Mommy.

607
00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:02.770
- Hey Pastor. how's it going?

608
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.273
Brandon. hi. it's.

609
00:45:06.413 --> 00:45:08.963
I'm not sure how to tell
you this. it's about Adam.

610
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.370
- Well. what about him?

611
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:13.903
He's dead.

612
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.060
I have a good friend
who's a police officer.

613
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.930
they found him late last night.

614
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:24.930
And it looks like he took his own life.

615
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.053
I'm so sorry. Brandon.

616
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.273
- Damen right. Damen Mudrick?

617
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:57.880
You served one tour to
Iraq. two to Afghanistan.

618
00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.900
- Yes. sir.

619
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.550
- Oh. based on your last mission.

620
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.130
you were awarded the Bronze Star.

621
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.223
Congratulations.

622
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.390
I think it's fair to
say that you've fallen

623
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.650
on some hard times haven't you?

624
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:12.600
- It's fair to say.

625
00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.290
- Do you know this man?

626
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:25.420
He was handed over to us by the Iraqis.

627
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.170
They say he's Al Qaeda.

628
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.190
He says that you gave him something.

629
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.630
something very important.

630
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.230
Sergeant. what did you give him?

631
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.170
- We lost a few guys outside
the city to these RPGs.

632
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.393
coming inside this warehouse.

633
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.570
they doused the building with gunfire.

634
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.060
My team took the top floor.

635
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.333
We were only there

636
00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:56.313
to make sure that there were no survivors.

637
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:59.410
- Tubby you got the rear?

638
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.940
- Yeah. I got it.

639
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.260
- Gamma. go pull security on rear.

640
00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.741
- Alpha. we got inventory. let's move.

641
00:48:06.741 --> 00:48:08.861
Captain. we got aa live one.

642
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:11.444
- Take him. take him. take him.

643
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.500
- He was in bad shape.

644
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.823
We figured it die so.

645
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.543
So what?

646
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.393
- So we left him.

647
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.243
- Sergeant. this man should
have been a prisoner.

648
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.803
Sergeant. what did you give him?

649
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.799
- We gotta get outta here.

650
00:48:44.799 --> 00:48:46.757
Hurry. hurry.

651
00:48:53.543 --> 00:48:55.293
- I gave him a bible.

652
00:48:56.479 --> 00:48:57.896
An English bible.

653
00:49:22.936 --> 00:49:23.769
- Hey.

654
00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:26.913
- Hey. good morning. Pastor James.

655
00:49:26.913 --> 00:49:28.007
- Good morning. may I?

656
00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:28.840
- Absolutely.

657
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.658
A bus picks her up down the corner.

658
00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:32.994
- Is Brandon here?

659
00:49:32.994 --> 00:49:33.827
- Yeah. yeah.

660
00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:35.130
- It's okay. if I speak
with him for a moment?

661
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:36.000
- Come on in.

662
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.833
- Thank you.

663
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.183
Brandon. there's no way
he could have known.

664
00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.600
I have heard so many stories

665
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.363
of people who seemed completely fine.

666
00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:13.720
You just don't know.

667
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.863
There's nothing you could have done.

668
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.600
- But you knew you could
have done something?

669
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.433
God.

670
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.370
God was there.

671
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.620
Just watching when Adam
picked up that knife.

672
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:36.330
He was watching as he
slit each of his wrists

673
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:38.883
and he didn't do a thing to stop it.

674
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.320
God was there when Adam
was in Afghanistan.

675
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.540
seeing people's limbs get blown off.

676
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.100
children get shot.

677
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.510
but he didn't stop it.

678
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.760
No. all he did was stop
the bomb from going off

679
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.360
just to make sure Adam lived
a little bit longer to suffer

680
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.933
before he died anyway.

681
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.960
That's the God I preached
to dozens of soldiers

682
00:51:02.918 --> 00:51:05.563
and said he loved them and
wanted the best for them.

683
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:16.230
- Meeting you was the best thing

684
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:18.103
that could've ever happened to Adam.

685
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.850
God used you to help save his soul.

686
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:27.050
even if none of us could
help save his life.

687
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.913
- So that's it.

688
00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:34.953
That's all he promises.

689
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.513
Nothing for this life.

690
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.290
- Ella we made it to the playoffs.

691
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:45.230
- Emma was great.

692
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.703
- I know. Angela didn't
even miss one goal.

693
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.710
- What is the matter with you?

694
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.140
You coulda hurt me.
don't you pay attention

695
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.040
to what you're doing?

696
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.133
- What is going on?

697
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.603
- I'm sorry.

698
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.760
I was laying on the.

699
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.738
I was just. I was trying
to. I'm sorry listen.

700
00:52:03.738 --> 00:52:04.725
- Go to your room.

701
00:52:04.725 --> 00:52:05.800
Go to your room.

702
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.650
Right now. go. go. it's okay. go. go.

703
00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:10.943
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

704
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:16.073
Gary. you need help.

705
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:17.963
- Help. yeah okay.

706
00:52:17.963 --> 00:52:20.180
I'm gonna go see Tom in his bible friends

707
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.250
so that they can quote cliches at me

708
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.787
and tell me what a horrible person I am.

709
00:52:23.787 --> 00:52:25.912
- You're not a horrible person.

710
00:52:25.912 --> 00:52:28.853
But you need help. but I can't
give it to you. I have tried.

711
00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.150
Gary. you listen to me right now.

712
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.093
I will not let you hurt our children.

713
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.387
Even if it means I take
them away from you.

714
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.253
- Get the medic. come on.

715
00:53:37.253 --> 00:53:38.785
Chris. Chris. come on man.

716
00:53:38.785 --> 00:53:40.383
- Chris please look at me.

717
00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.216
Look at me.

718
00:53:41.216 --> 00:53:42.717
- Come on. come on.
- We can make it.

719
00:53:42.717 --> 00:53:44.753
- Gotta come on.

720
00:53:44.753 --> 00:53:45.979
Hang in there. hang in there.

721
00:53:45.979 --> 00:53:49.397
We can stay here. we
can't stay here. man. come on.

722
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.000
- He believed you. you know.

723
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:08.723
we all did.

724
00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:12.003
- Damen. I'm so sorry.

725
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.180
Strangest thing though.

726
00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.823
this mission. when we first started out.

727
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.040
had to clearest feeling
that I was gonna die.

728
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.673
Can I see your bible. I
don't have mine anymore.

729
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:50.503
Read that.

730
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:54.623
Verse four.

731
00:55:01.267 --> 00:55:04.247
- "He will wipe away
every tear from your eyes.

732
00:55:04.247 --> 00:55:09.247
"There will be no more death
or mourning or crying or pain

733
00:55:09.867 --> 00:55:12.757
"for the old order of
things has passed away."

734
00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.710
- Chris found that one the other day.

735
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:24.763
He always liked to read
from the end of the book.

736
00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.293
Do you want to know what's better

737
00:55:28.293 --> 00:55:29.930
than having every tear wiped away?

738
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.693
Never having to cry
'em in the first place.

739
00:55:57.154 --> 00:55:58.110
I just want to go.

740
00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:59.723
I need to see my family again.

741
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.743
Tom. it's Gary.

742
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.843
What time did you say
that meeting was again?

743
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.430
- Welcome everyone. I'd like to thank you

744
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:13.780
for coming to today's meeting.

745
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.040
I know it's time away from
your family. but we are family.

746
00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.800
we have a bond of brotherhood

747
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.510
and it's great that you can come here

748
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.418
and share time with us.

749
00:57:21.418 --> 00:57:22.610
It's a safe place to talk about things.

750
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:23.750
if you feel like talking about it

751
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.650
or listen to the experiences of others.

752
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.050
Thanks again for being here.

753
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.370
- So I did a two tours in Iraq

754
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:40.810
and when I come home.
life's never been the same.

755
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:48.233
I have anger issues and
these demons in my head.

756
00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:51.700
it's hard to sleep at night

757
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.033
and I know I'm hard to live with.

758
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:57.263
with all the issues that I deal with.

759
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.723
My wife left me.

760
00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:05.010
She couldn't deal with it anymore.

761
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:09.430
I don't have a relationship with my kids.

762
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:10.343
It's just me.

763
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:12.703
me and the demons.

764
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:16.790
- His first assignment was in Iraq

765
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:19.457
and he said. "Honey. you stay home

766
00:58:19.457 --> 00:58:24.347
"and plan the wedding while
I go and defend our country."

767
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.070
So off he went

768
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:30.523
and I went home and started
planning the wedding.

769
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.463
But Daniel never came home.

770
00:58:41.223 --> 00:58:43.306
And there was no wedding.

771
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:46.450
- He called us one day and he said

772
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.920
that they were shipping
him out to Afghanistan

773
00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.233
and he promised me. he'd be back.

774
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:58.093
I'm gonna tell you I prayed
every single day for him.

775
00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:01.103
As a mom. I was never so scared.

776
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:08.383
I remember the day sitting in that chair.

777
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:14.743
right in front of that flag-draped casket.

778
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:21.373
And I said. there is no way
that my son is in that casket.

779
00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.163
They didn't even have much to identify.

780
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:31.460
I know the government made a huge mistake

781
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.763
and my son is gonna come home
to me. just like you promised.

782
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.160
- You said 12:30.
- Around 12:30.

783
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.503
- 12:30 again.

784
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.310
- So you off next week.

785
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:54.820
- You guys just open a Walmart?

786
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.520
- We're the Honor Guard.

787
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.203
We conduct military service
for a fallen brothers.

788
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.390
- And this is Doug.

789
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.083
we just slewed his casket today.

790
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.350
- Doug was the comrade
here at the VFW Post 573.

791
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.250
I've known him ever since I was a kid.

792
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.350
- We do about a hundred funerals a year.

793
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.283
- A hundred?

794
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:29.223
I'm so sorry guys. I didn't know.

795
01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.043
- That's what we do. we continue to serve.

796
01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.303
And we're always
looking for new members.

797
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.943
- Hi. my name's Thomas.

798
01:00:47.403 --> 01:00:48.953
I'm not really here for myself.

799
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.673
I'm here for my father. these were his.

800
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.780
Every 4th of July. we would all

801
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.490
watch the fireworks together
as family. you know.

802
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:03.093
And after he came back.

803
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.560
he didn't want to watch
'em with us anymore.

804
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.343
You said they scared him too much.

805
01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:20.063
The other night my
father took his own life.

806
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.540
Now I gotta explain to my little brother

807
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.060
why his daddy's not
gonna be around anymore.

808
01:01:32.254 --> 01:01:33.840
How do you explain to a 12 year old kid

809
01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.990
that his dad's not
gonna be around anymore?

810
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:43.710
- I appreciate everyone sharing.

811
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.420
Thank you for being here.
it means a lot to everyone.

812
01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.283
Before we close. does anybody
else have anything to add?

813
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:56.270
- Yeah. I got something.

814
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.263
My name is Gary Newhouse. sergeant. Army.

815
01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.640
My friends are well. my fellow soldiers.

816
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.590
they call me Tubby.

817
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.640
I joined the military
because I needed change.

818
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.113
I needed a direction.

819
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.563
And I did get change.

820
01:02:27.192 --> 01:02:30.290
You know. my unit. we had this idea

821
01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:34.670
that if we carried Bibles
with us everywhere we went.

822
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:37.323
we would be safe. we'd be protected.

823
01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:42.033
But obviously that didn't
do us too much good.

824
01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.880
We were stationed up on a
fob in the Kunar Valley.

825
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.713
small ambushes day and night.

826
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:53.783
And I'd find myself asking.

827
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.483
where's God in all of this?

828
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:07.043
But I know now. I know
that God is with me.

829
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.183
he's the only reason I'm here.

830
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.220
- Are you sure you want to do this?

831
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.163
- Yes sir. I am.

832
01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.180
- This is very serious.

833
01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.450
You want to see it from a
different perspective. son?

834
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:24.393
You hand a flag to a wife or a daughter.

835
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.530
you watch their hearts break
at the playing of. "Taps."

836
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.913
I know how hard it is.

837
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.320
But you have another chance.

838
01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:41.600
Just don't let your mind go dark.

839
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.773
'Cause when you do.

840
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.083
it's over.

841
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:02.990
- Well. there they are.

842
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:04.340
You want me to go with you?

843
01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.597
- No. I got to do this
myself. thanks though.

844
01:05:41.307 --> 01:05:45.927
shine your light on me

845
01:05:55.008 --> 01:05:59.587
know you don't need me

846
01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:53.773
- Hello.

847
01:06:53.773 --> 01:06:55.169
- Preacher.

848
01:06:55.169 --> 01:06:57.663
- Damen. what's going on man.

849
01:06:57.663 --> 01:06:59.120
I tried calling since we got back.

850
01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.790
but the number you gave me doesn't work.

851
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:02.863
- Yeah. yeah.

852
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:07.650
Hey listen. do you remember that mission

853
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:10.723
at the warehouse right before Chris?

854
01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.560
Anyway. that wounded guy.

855
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.650
you remember I gave him my bible?

856
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:17.690
- Yeah.

857
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:19.200
- You're not gonna believe this.

858
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.430
I can barely believe it.
I can barely believe it.

859
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:21.480
but he's still alive.

860
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.866
If it wasn't for you. none
of this would have happened.

861
01:07:25.866 --> 01:07:29.020
- What. what wouldn't have happened?

862
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.850
- He took that one bible.

863
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:31.970
and over the last two years.

864
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:34.283
he's been planting churches all over Iraq.

865
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.000
He wasn't even a terrorist.

866
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.910
they were holding him against his will.

867
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.290
- And he's been.

868
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.690
- What are the odds of that?

869
01:07:44.816 --> 01:07:45.650
I don't know about you.

870
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:49.253
but I left Iraq thinking
that God was nowhere in it.

871
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:52.380
But because of what you did.

872
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.405
hundreds of people ain't
saved over there right now.

873
01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.017
And that's not all.

874
01:07:57.017 --> 01:07:59.760
Yasin. that's his name. Pastor Yasin.

875
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.740
And I got to meet him.

876
01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.960
The government granted him asylum here.

877
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.100
He tried to thank me for saving his life.

878
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.520
But I told him that you were
the one that gave me a bible.

879
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.057
He'd like to meet you if that's cool.

880
01:08:10.057 --> 01:08:12.660
- Well great. I'd like to meet him too.

881
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.040
and see you again.

882
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.133
Where are you guys?

883
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.093
- After we last met in Jalalabad.

884
01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.213
they put me in the military.

885
01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.627
I refused to join

886
01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:45.283
and they called me terrorist.

887
01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.900
sympathizer to American.

888
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.200
They put me back in the prison.

889
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.263
After that. they traded
me to your government.

890
01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.923
I have this for years now.

891
01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.653
I have read it many. many times.

892
01:09:06.697 --> 01:09:08.843
And this is what I come to know about it.

893
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:15.433
God always will finish
the work he has started.

894
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:44.063
- I think it's awesome.

895
01:09:44.063 --> 01:09:45.990
he's gonna get housing assistance.

896
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:48.463
I just wish more homeless
veterans would get that.

897
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:51.763
- Yeah. I tried for it but.

898
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.853
Look. when I got back home.

899
01:09:57.852 --> 01:10:00.080
I didn't even wanna stay at my old place.

900
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.180
Chris and I shared it.

901
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.353
Everything just reminded
me of him. you know.

902
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.260
- So where do you live now?

903
01:10:09.146 --> 01:10:11.200
- Well. I mean. I got some money.

904
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.550
The government wasn't
totally without sympathy.

905
01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.840
I'll be all right.

906
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.090
I'll get back on my feet.

907
01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:40.330
of wrong in my life

908
01:11:55.169 --> 01:11:58.694
in our bed tonight

909
01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:08.691
took one to figure out

910
01:12:43.262 --> 01:12:46.391
it's just you and me

911
01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:57.562
eye and I can't seem to see

912
01:12:57.562 --> 01:13:02.562
so blind it almost sees

913
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:24.364
I know they're just fine

914
01:13:24.364 --> 01:13:28.324
and our dreams tonight

915
01:13:35.788 --> 01:13:40.771
me and see everything

916
01:13:45.948 --> 01:13:50.948
when daddy is home now
