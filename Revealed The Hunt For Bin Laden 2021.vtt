00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.386
to understand the inner workings
of al‐Qaeda

173
00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:49.823
and disrupt
their deadly planning.

174
00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:52.092
‐ Our goal wasn't just to
get Osama bin Laden.

175
00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:54.461
it wasn't just to get al‐Qaeda.

176
00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:58.865
it was to do that in such an
intense fashion that we were not

177
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.135
going to take another
9/11 along the way.

178
00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:05.905
‐ So the goal was basically
put al‐Qaeda on the run

179
00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:09.476
so that they can no longer
generate those major operations.

180
00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.579
They're focused more
on their survival.

181
00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:15.582
(narrator)
The intelligence community
moves their analysts

182
00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:18.852
to the front lines.
integrating with military units.

183
00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.154
leading the fight
against al‐Qaeda.

184
00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:24.324
The National Geospatial
Intelligence Agency.

185
00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:28.161
or NGA. plays a key role.

186
00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:31.364
‐ So what does NGA provide?

187
00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:35.068
They provide the imagery
of the battlefield.

188
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.904
If a compound is going
to be raided.

189
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.806
what's the compound look like?

190
00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.208
Are there blind spots
in the compound?

191
00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:46.079
So when the assault team.
or when the troops go in.

192
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.815
what are they going
to be expecting?

193
00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:50.316
‐ You go conduct the operation.

194
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.985
you collect
all the intel you can.

195
00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.653
you come back. you turn over

196
00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:57.190
all of that information
to your intelligence team.

197
00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.159
They start putting
all that together.

198
00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.693
connecting all the dots.

199
00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:02.362
‐ If the analysts didn't have
the information there.

200
00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:05.298
they would reach back
to Langley. FBI headquarters.

201
00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.300
NSA or wherever they needed to

202
00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:10.136
to get the information and make
it readily available to us.

203
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.438
‐ We understood
how they operated.

204
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:16.142
their up tempo. and we fit
right into that.

205
00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:17.810
(SEAL #1) The sooner you
can hit the next target.

206
00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:20.013
you can catch them when
they're not prepared for it

207
00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:22.115
and just keep going that way.
start building your web.

208
00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.184
getting to
the higher level enemy.

209
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.226
(Tina) In pulling them out
and detaining them.

210
00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:35.562
you're neutering bin Laden's
organization by taking out

211
00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:38.464
his most seasoned.
competent lieutenants.

212
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.101
‐ We knew that we had to
generate an onslaught

213
00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:47.540
against the enemy.
to take the initiative.

214
00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:49.409
(Adm. McRaven) The forces on
the ground were working

215
00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.110
generally 20 hours a day.

216
00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:54.614
sometimes 24 hours a day.
several days in a row.

217
00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.416
When you're running
that many missions.

218
00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:59.519
the ground forces are just
very. very good at what they do.

219
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.458
(narrator)
In spite of these efforts.

220
00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:08.661
al‐Qaeda's leader
remains at large.

221
00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:12.498
Seven years. four months.
and nine days after 9/11.

222
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.034
a new president
takes up the hunt.

223
00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:18.204
‐ I. Barack Hussein Obama.
do solemnly swear...

224
00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:22.175
I had committed to
reinvigorating

225
00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:26.412
what appeared to have
been a stalled approach

226
00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.848
to getting bin Laden.

227
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:32.518
I assigned Leon Panetta.
our CIA director.

228
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:38.691
to mobilize all the assets
that had already worked on it

229
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.827
and take a fresh look at it.

230
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.331
‐ The president made clear to me

231
00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:48.434
the importance of going
after bin Laden

232
00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:50.803
and I not only
agreed with him.

233
00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:55.842
but I said that effort
was in many ways responsible

234
00:12:56.075 --> 00:13:00.246
for my desire to become
head of the CIA.

235
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.682
‐ Finding bin Laden
was always a priority

236
00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.351
for both President Bush
and President Obama.

237
00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:08.855
They never let us forget that
it was a high priority.

238
00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.624
But in truth.
not much was going on.

239
00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:14.060
You know. CIA was
trying to find him.

240
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.830
but we weren't having much luck.

241
00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:19.666
When President Obama
came in.

242
00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:24.137
he obviously wanted
a more intensified search.

243
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.105
Frankly. I thought it was
a little bit like

244
00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:28.875
asking Michelangelo
to paint faster.

245
00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.613
(Tina) I'd been working
al‐Qaeda for several years.

246
00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.449
working on threats
mostly to the homeland

247
00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:39.285
and US interests overseas.
trying to disrupt plots.

248
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:42.522
Working threats every day
that there wasn't an attack

249
00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.923
was success. right?

250
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.360
You knew you had
done your job.

251
00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.395
I started working on
bin Laden specifically.

252
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.230
right around 2007.

253
00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:53.599
When you're moving into
a manhunt scenario.

254
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.669
every day that nothing happens
is a failure.

255
00:13:56.903 --> 00:14:01.107
(narrator)
Driven by the potential costs of
the failure to find bin Laden.

256
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.043
intelligence officers accept
greater personal risk

257
00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:06.279
in the intensifying hunt.

258
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.880
‐ You have to have
the human intelligence.

259
00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.983
If you don't. your war is going
to be longer. much more costly.

260
00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:15.555
the outcome much less certain.
which means at some point

261
00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:19.826
you are gonna have to put your
people in the company

262
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:23.162
of members of
a terrorist organization.

263
00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.665
(narrator)
Towards the end of 2009.

264
00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.834
the intelligence community
mobilizes around

265
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.169
a possible lead to bin Laden.

266
00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:36.976
‐ The Jordanians had suggested
that they had their hands on

267
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.181
a possible spy who had
some medical training.

268
00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:46.986
and that they thought there was
a good chance you might be able

269
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.690
to go into Afghanistan.
but also Pakistan.

270
00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:53.760
and see if he could
locate Zawahiri.

271
00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:56.429
who was bin Laden's second
in command.

272
00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:59.599
‐ We sent about a dozen of our
best officers out to a base

273
00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:02.668
in eastern Afghanistan
so that we could vet him.

274
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.872
(narrator)
On December 30th. 2009.

275
00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:09.108
the CIA sets up a meeting
with the possible spy.

276
00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:10.977
Dr. Humam al Balawi.

277
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.679
at Forward Operating
Base Chapman.

278
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.215
named for Sergeant
Nathan Chapman.

279
00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:20.286
the first American soldier
to die in Afghanistan.

280
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.955
‐ Chapman sits in
kind of a bowl.

281
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:25.191
Some people call it
the coast bowl.

282
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.126
where you have mostly
mountains around you.

283
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.862
and in the middle
there's the city.

284
00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:33.566
This is literally the end
of the line.

285
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.501
‐ Director Panetta had
briefed the president.

286
00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:37.403
had briefed
the National Security Council

287
00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:39.906
about this important.
tantalizing lead.

288
00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.041
And we all waited for that
meeting to occur.

289
00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:49.849
(narrator)
At a remote base on
the front lines in Afghanistan.

290
00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:52.618
American intelligence officers
wait to meet a man

291
00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.988
they believe might lead them to
the highest levels of al‐Qaeda.

292
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.626
‐ The day of.
we're all grouped together.

293
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.728
waiting for the arrival.

294
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:07.033
Everybody's excited to do
the job that they needed to do

295
00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.769
and to get the information
they needed to get.

296
00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.772
(Panetta) The car pulled up.
and this individual.

297
00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:15.708
instead of getting out
on the side where people

298
00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:19.712
were all standing.
got out on the other side.

299
00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:21.380
That spooked
the security officers

300
00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.883
who immediately went up to him.

301
00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:28.321
and they noticed that he
had a hand inside of his cloak.

302
00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:31.591
‐ With any sensitive
operation like this.

303
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.493
there's already risk involved.

304
00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:36.696
And that's the nature
of that business.

305
00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.898
Unfortunately. to learn
about bad people.

306
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:40.399
you have to meet with
bad people.

307
00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:42.268
‐ And they told him.
get your hands up.

308
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:47.106
get your hands out of your robe.
and he refused to do that.

309
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.910
But by the time they had
a chance to do anything.

310
00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:54.180
he had pulled the pin
on a suicide vest

311
00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.082
that was extremely powerful.

312
00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:05.057
♪

313
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:08.895
‐ It sent metal shrapnel.

314
00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:12.098
And not to mention the rocks
that were under his feet

315
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.967
became shrapnel.
it just sent it all out.

316
00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:19.205
And I ended up with eight‐‐

317
00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:20.973
eight shrapnel wounds
in my legs.

318
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.142
but one in the forehead.

319
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.911
And the last thing I remember

320
00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:28.180
is being loaded onto
the helicopter.

321
00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:31.717
And then I woke up maybe a week
later in Bethesda. Maryland.

322
00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:37.823
‐ That vest killed seven
of our CIA officers

323
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:41.027
and security individuals.

324
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.497
it wounded at least another
four or five others.

325
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.399
(Redacted)
The bombing at FOB Chapman

326
00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.402
was one of the most
terrible days

327
00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:52.838
we've had a long time.

328
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:58.077
Personal friends of mine.
people that I loved died there.

329
00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:00.880
(Letitia Long) I believe that
had a real impact for all

330
00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:03.182
of the intelligence community.

331
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:07.320
While all of us certainly
knew theoretically

332
00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.790
that this could occur
as folks are deployed forward.

333
00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:14.994
until it actually happens.
it's not real.

334
00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:21.334
And. that said. we still
had volunteers lining up

335
00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.235
to deploy forward.

336
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.610
(Redacted)
I've heard people say there's
no piece of intelligence

337
00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:34.046
that's worth the life
of one of our officers.

338
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.382
I disagree.

339
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.885
I think there are times
when you. a single person.

340
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:44.624
can get intelligence that
might save another person

341
00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:48.194
another two people.
a car full of people.

342
00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.362
an embassy full of people.

343
00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:50.696
an airplane full of people.

344
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.431
a city full of people.

345
00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:57.837
‐ It was tragic what happened.

346
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.307
and the lives that were lost.

347
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.078
but that incident created
an even greater impetus

348
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.480
within the CIA.

349
00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:11.851
particularly those involved with
the hunt for bin Laden.

350
00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:17.923
‐ Something that I noticed in
CIA is when we suffer a loss.

351
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:22.294
you know. in the line of duty.
there is always. every time.

352
00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:25.297
an increase in resolve on
the part of everyone

353
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:27.900
to do their job better.

354
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.802
And I think people realize

355
00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:32.405
that you can grieve
while you work.

356
00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:36.375
You can grieve while
you work harder.

357
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:38.444
(military drumming)

358
00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:47.853
(Barack Obama)
Nine years have now passed.

359
00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:51.357
In that time. we have shed

360
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.694
more tears than
we will ever know.

361
00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:57.096
And though it must seem
some days as though the world

362
00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:02.768
has moved on to other things.
I say to you today.

363
00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:07.139
that your loved ones endure in
the heart of our nation

364
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:09.542
now and forever.

365
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.849
‐ The question that people were
constantly asking us was.

366
00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:19.018
where's bin Laden?

367
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.620
So we were constantly looking
for locations.

368
00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:24.890
As time goes on.
you start to realize. well.

369
00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:27.193
there's an infinite number
of possibilities on

370
00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:28.894
where bin Laden could be.

371
00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:31.831
We have to be smarter about
how we approach it.

372
00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.033
We flipped the question
and the strategy from. you know.

373
00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:38.304
where's bin Laden to who is
harboring bin Laden.

374
00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:40.906
because that's a more limited
number of possibilities.

375
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.374
You don't have
millions of people

376
00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.743
who could be harboring
bin Laden.

377
00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:47.113
you've really got.
you know. two dozen at best.

378
00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.882
‐ We had already
sort of understood that

379
00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:53.385
he would be likely to be
with his family.

380
00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:56.622
And so. you know.
that sensationalized story

381
00:20:56.856 --> 00:21:00.426
that he's with 100 fighters
in a cave in Afghanistan

382
00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.296
really doesn't start
to look very likely.

383
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.666
‐ We had a strategy where
we had individuals on a list.

384
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.135
and these are the people
that we need to go after

385
00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:10.870
in order to find bin Laden.

386
00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.441
Abu Ahmed was in many ways
qualitatively different

387
00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.243
than some of the other leads
we would get.

388
00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.078
It just made a lot of sense.

389
00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:20.579
He was a Pashtun.

390
00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:23.549
he was a Pakistani
who grew up in Kuwait.

391
00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:27.052
So he spoke native Pashto
and he spoke native Arabic.

392
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.688
He also. as we would learn very
quickly into the hunt.

393
00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:31.190
he worked for
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

394
00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:33.392
who was the gatekeeper
for bin Laden.

395
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:37.463
He can operate in
Pakistan as a Pakistani.

396
00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:39.899
but he has kind of
an Arab mindset. right?

397
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.500
That's somebody that. you know.

398
00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:44.036
would be a great harborer
for bin Laden.

399
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:49.008
(narrator)
Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed.
known as Abu Ahmed al‐Kuwaiti.

400
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:53.379
had a history of working for
senior al‐Qaeda leaders.

401
00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:57.616
In August 2010.
American intelligence locks on

402
00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.119
to the cell phones of al‐Kuwaiti
and his brother

403
00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:02.955
in the Pakistani city
of Peshawar.

404
00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:06.192
Their movements indicate they
may be acting as couriers.

405
00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:10.362
‐ The couriers were taking
their cell phones

406
00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:12.765
well away from the compound
then activating them.

407
00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.501
then making the calls home.
then turning them off

408
00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:16.969
and then going back
to the compound.

409
00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:21.874
‐ The couriers were
talking discreet.

410
00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:25.744
It was not open talking.
like normal talking.

411
00:22:25.978 --> 00:22:29.748
‐ One phone call was from
a friend who basically said.

412
00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:32.518
"what are you doing"
to the courier.

413
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:34.520
And the courier
kept ignoring it.

414
00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.222
trying to dodge the question.

415
00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.324
And he said. "No. no.
tell me what you're doing.

416
00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:39.725
"I haven't seen you
in a long time.

417
00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:41.393
What are you doing?"

418
00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:43.295
And there was
a pause. and he said.

419
00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.465
"I'm doing the same thing
I did before."

420
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.335
And there was suddenly silence.

421
00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.503
and the person on the other end
of the line said.

422
00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.672
"Go with God."

423
00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:58.043
Surveillance tracked
these couriers

424
00:22:58.277 --> 00:23:00.746
who had a little white SUV.

425
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.049
and they tracked this
little white SUV

426
00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:08.020
from Peshawar to
a place called Abbottabad.

427
00:23:08.254 --> 00:23:10.089
which is near the capital.

428
00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:18.697
‐ There was an understanding

429
00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:21.567
that this was
far more real

430
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.070
than anything else that we had
been presented with in the years

431
00:23:25.304 --> 00:23:28.307
since I had been working it.

432
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.578
‐ I remember the meeting
in August of 2010.

433
00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:36.015
An officer who we call Gary

434
00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.416
opened the binder
and he said.

435
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.552
"Director. we have
something new to report."

436
00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:44.657
And he said. we have been
tracking two brothers

437
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.426
who historically were couriers
for bin Laden.

438
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.827
and we have followed them.

439
00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:50.663
We have located them.
and we have followed them

440
00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:52.998
up to a town called Abbottabad.

441
00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.134
which is north of Islamabad.

442
00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:58.203
down the end of
a dead end street.

443
00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:00.072
And at the end of
that dead end street.

444
00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:03.409
there's a large home there that
looks like a fortress.

445
00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:05.945
And I'll never forget.
Director Panetta looked up

446
00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:09.648
from his briefing materials
and he said. "A fortress?

447
00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:11.050
Tell me about that fortress."

448
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.218
‐ It had 18 foot walls
on one side.

449
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:17.056
12 foot walls
on the other side.

450
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.658
barbed wire at the top
of these walls.

451
00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:23.896
And on the third floor
of this compound.

452
00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:26.365
there was an eight foot wall.

453
00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:29.601
‐ If you're on the third floor.
you'd kind of like a view.

454
00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:32.604
There was a privacy wall
that was constructed

455
00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.773
that limited the view.

456
00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:38.143
or was it to limit the view
into the compound?

457
00:24:38.377 --> 00:24:41.080
(Panetta)
And my eyes lit up
because I said.

458
00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:46.819
well. this is probably
the best piece of evidence

459
00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:48.988
we've ever had since Tora Bora.

460
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.458
‐ The land and the compound was
registered to two brothers.

461
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:55.561
And though the value
of the compound

462
00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:59.898
was $1 million. they had no
visible source of income.

463
00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:02.101
No one really left
the compound.

464
00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.070
The children didn't leave
the compound for schooling.

465
00:25:05.304 --> 00:25:06.505
Everything was done on site.

466
00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:10.642
‐ We looked for a cell phone.
we looked for Wi‐Fi.

467
00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:13.645
We looked for other emanations.
there were none.

468
00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:18.050
We looked at whether there was
a local telephone we could find.

469
00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:20.119
We looked at. also.
to the degree that we could.

470
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.487
all local records.

471
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.023
‐ The residents here
burned their trash.

472
00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:25.457
No one else burned
their trash.

473
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:28.293
They put it at the side of
the road like we do here

474
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:29.528
in the United States.

475
00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:33.532
‐ There was a vehicle garage

476
00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.601
and it was double‐gate secured.

477
00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:38.303
which essentially means that
you would be able to

478
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:42.374
pull a vehicle in from
the street without exposing

479
00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.109
the interior view
of the compound

480
00:25:44.343 --> 00:25:46.845
to anyone who might just
be happening to peer in.

481
00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:51.784
(Panetta)
There was an individual

482
00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:55.521
who would come out sometimes.
you know. every other day

483
00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:59.224
and go into a yard.
and walk in circles

484
00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:02.027
very quickly like a prisoner
in a prison yard.

485
00:26:02.261 --> 00:26:06.331
Walk in circles. probably
about 10. 12. 20 times.

486
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.834
and then immediately go back in.

487
00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:10.636
And I remember
telling our people

488
00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:13.605
that could be bin Laden.

489
00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:15.441
It was an older gentleman.

490
00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:19.445
I said. let's get
some cameras on the walls.

491
00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:22.247
Let's get some telescopes
on the mountains.

492
00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:23.582
I mean. you've got to give me

493
00:26:23.816 --> 00:26:27.086
an ID of this person
who's doing that.

494
00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.388
(Kelton)
We thought about
putting cameras up

495
00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:33.325
in the trees that
surrounded the compound.

496
00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:35.727
but then they cut down
the trees.

497
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:38.397
Obviously. they. too.
were worried about security.

498
00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.167
(Letitia Long) We knew it was
a high value individual.

499
00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:45.838
We knew it was someone
of deference.

500
00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:48.740
There was a level of frustration

501
00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:51.944
that we could never see
Osama bin Laden.

502
00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.780
We‐‐ we just couldn't.

503
00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:05.858
In September 2010.
CIA director Leon Panetta

504
00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:09.695
goes to the White House
to inform President Barack Obama

505
00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:13.966
about a suspicious compound
in Abbottabad. Pakistan.

506
00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.768
(Cardillo)
It was around 5:00 pm.
and Leon Panetta

507
00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:18.370
taps me on the shoulder
and says we need

508
00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:20.506
to go upstairs
to brief the old man.

509
00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:23.108
Now. as I walked into the Oval
that evening.

510
00:27:23.342 --> 00:27:27.813
I had no idea what topic
we were updating the old man on.

511
00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:30.682
One of the analysts rolled out

512
00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:34.686
a very large
format photograph.

513
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.922
A satellite image

514
00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:40.592
of a facility
I had never seen before.

515
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:43.162
I recall the president asking
a few questions. you know.

516
00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.497
clarifying ones. you know.
how do we know this.

517
00:27:45.731 --> 00:27:47.900
how do we not know that.
et cetera?

518
00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:51.236
I don't feel the meeting went
longer than 15 minutes or so.

519
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.573
It was pretty short.

520
00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.341
And I remember the president
thanking the team.

521
00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:58.243
He said. okay. come back
when you have more.

522
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.079
(narrator)
Over years of hunting.

523
00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:03.415
intelligence analysts
produced a checklist

524
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:04.850
for the kinds of conditions

525
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:08.053
they thought bin Laden
would want in a hideout.

526
00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:11.723
The more they learn about
the Abbottabad compound.

527
00:28:11.957 --> 00:28:13.392
the more confident they become

528
00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:16.695
that this is
a critical location.

529
00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:19.731
‐ You would find. no matter who
you talked to on this team.

530
00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:24.203
that we were very certain
that we were on a place

531
00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:27.206
that required our attention.

532
00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.241
None of us believed at
any point in time that we were

533
00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:32.978
overestimating the potential
importance of this location.

534
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:36.949
‐ We would press them
and we would say. okay.

535
00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:41.853
what's your honest evaluation

536
00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:46.525
of the odds that bin Laden
is in that compound?

537
00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:48.860
And among
the different analysts.

538
00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:53.031
it ranged from 40% to 80%.

539
00:28:53.265 --> 00:28:54.199
‐ It didn't matter to me
too much

540
00:28:54.433 --> 00:28:57.502
what the seniors thought.

541
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.004
what I was
more interested in

542
00:28:59.238 --> 00:29:00.639
and what influenced me much more

543
00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.408
is what the confidence level

544
00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:06.979
of the working level analysts

545
00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:08.981
that had been working
this problem

546
00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:10.616
and what their
confidence level was.

547
00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:12.451
which was pretty high.

548
00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.620
And so I put
a lot of faith in that.

549
00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:18.957
(narrator)
Military planners develop
options for the president.

550
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:21.093
Bombing risks extensive
civilian deaths

551
00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:23.028
in adjoining homes.

552
00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:26.098
Even if bin Laden is in
the compound when it's hit.

553
00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:28.533
how will the US know?

554
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:32.237
The only way to be sure
is to send troops to find him.

555
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.876
‐ I initially
favored the raid

556
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.878
if it could be pulled off.

557
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:44.716
because I thought we would never
know if bin Laden were there

558
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.985
if we had used a bomb.

559
00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:50.389
(Clapper)
I was in favor of a raid

560
00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:53.458
simply because I thought
it'd be better to have

561
00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:57.296
thinking people on the ground
who could observe

562
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:59.464
and make judgments about
what to do.

563
00:29:59.698 --> 00:30:00.966
And then there was
still ambiguity

564
00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:02.567
as to whether
he was there or not.

565
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.170
‐ I mean. I wanted bin Laden
as bad as anybody.

566
00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:08.373
but my primary responsibility.

567
00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:12.911
as I saw it.
was the war in Afghanistan.

568
00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:18.950
And my worry was that if
we flew into Abbottabad.

569
00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:23.488
blew a bunch of stuff up
and got back out.

570
00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:26.024
the violation of
Pakistani sovereignty

571
00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:29.961
and the embarrassment to their
military would be so severe

572
00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:33.699
that they would cut our supply
line from Karachi to Afghanistan

573
00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:36.601
and we would lose the war
overnight.

574
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:38.804
(Obama) Obviously it was
a very dangerous operation.

575
00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:42.607
There was the diplomatic risks

576
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:48.280
of going into
a foreign country

577
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.948
without their permission.

578
00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:52.417
And we considered
the possibility

579
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:57.155
of tipping off the Pakistani
government ahead of time.

580
00:30:57.389 --> 00:31:00.192
But there were also factions
within the Pakistani government

581
00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:03.895
that were not as trustworthy.

582
00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:08.066
and we thought it was too risky
to give them a heads up.

583
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.902
‐ I had gotten to know
Admiral McRaven.

584
00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:17.876
and was not surprised that
he made a very compelling case

585
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.980
that he could mount
a successful raid.

586
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:24.783
‐ I wrote my thesis at
the Naval Postgraduate School

587
00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.518
on special operations.

588
00:31:26.752 --> 00:31:28.920
And what you saw on
the successful mission

589
00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:31.089
was simplicity was key.

590
00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:34.159
So as I looked at this.
it became pretty simple.

591
00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:37.629
I just decided we will
fly directly to the target.

592
00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:41.099
you know. take down the target.
get bin Laden and fly back.

593
00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:44.136
Now. that‐‐ when we went
to do the detailed planning.

594
00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:45.937
I knew it would not
be that easy.

595
00:31:46.171 --> 00:31:47.472
I had an opportunity
to brief the president

596
00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:49.508
before bringing in the planners.

597
00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.476
And at one point in time.
the president asked me.

598
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.445
so can you do this mission?

599
00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:54.646
And I was very candid with him.

600
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.081
I said. Mr. President.
I don't know.

601
00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.749
‐ We had to worry about
the possibilities

602
00:31:57.983 --> 00:32:01.653
of interception by
Pakistani Air Forces.

603
00:32:01.887 --> 00:32:05.056
Landing. we had to take into
account the possibility

604
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.727
that they would cause
a commotion when a bunch

605
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.329
of helicopters land in
a community like that.

606
00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:13.799
This is a residential community

607
00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:17.936
just a few miles from
a military college.

608
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.606
This is a town in which you have

609
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.476
a whole lot of Pakistani
military there.

610
00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:27.179
And so.

611
00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:30.949
could we get
in and out safely?

612
00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:33.051
‐ I said I haven't had
a chance to bring in

613
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.821
the aviation planners
and the SEALs.

614
00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:39.324
I need to do that first before
I can come back and tell you

615
00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:41.760
with 100% certainty
that we can do this.

616
00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.094
And he said.
how much time do you need?

617
00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:45.464
Recognizing that we were
up against the clock.

618
00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:46.798
I told him I needed three weeks.

619
00:32:47.032 --> 00:32:48.667
‐ We were under
a time pressure

620
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.471
just not knowing what
bin Laden would do.

621
00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:54.673
If he were there.
how long would he be there?

622
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:58.109
‐ Another factor we considered
is. you know.

623
00:32:58.343 --> 00:32:59.778
we delay this.
it's bound to leak.

624
00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:02.047
‐ There was a lot of concern
that if some action

625
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.451
wasn't taken quickly.
we'd be back to square one.

626
00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:12.290
(narrator)
In January 2011.

627
00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.360
Admiral McRaven begins
organizing the raid.

628
00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:17.095
To heightened secrecy.

629
00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:20.932
the mission. known
as Operation Neptune Spear.

630
00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:24.369
will be carried out under
CIA authority.

631
00:33:24.603 --> 00:33:27.405
‐ The inclusion. if you will.
of the special operations forces

632
00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:29.674
to the agency really
wasn't anything unusual.

633
00:33:29.908 --> 00:33:32.644
We have for decades.
when the time was required.

634
00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:36.381
essentially been secunded to
the agency for various missions.

635
00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.484
I had one other person that was
part of my planning element

636
00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:42.854
for the first several months
because the list of people that

637
00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:45.323
the president agreed could be
part of this with very small.

638
00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:48.193
‐ Admiral McRaven told me
to go over to the agency

639
00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.262
and go get a brief.

640
00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:54.065
So that next day. I drove over
to CIA headquarters.

641
00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:57.502
They pointed me back
to a side closet.

642
00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:59.237
and there were
some desks in there.

643
00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:01.540
and there were three guys
sitting in there.

644
00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:03.675
And I walked in.
I knew two of them.

645
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:05.377
and they handed me a binder.

646
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.245
They said. go ahead
and read through that

647
00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:08.580
and then we can talk.

648
00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.182
And upon flipping
the binder open.

649
00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.552
the first picture that
I saw was UBL.

650
00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:15.287
And that's the first time

651
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.889
that I knew that that's
what this was about.

652
00:34:18.123 --> 00:34:19.224
(Redacted) As soon as
I read through everything.

653
00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:20.625
it just all made sense.

654
00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:22.727
And I bought it. you know.
hiding in plain sight.

655
00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:26.298
The measures that were taken by
those that were at the facility

656
00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:29.067
were extraordinary.
would not have been happening

657
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:32.203
were there not something
very interesting there.

658
00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.639
So once we got the direction
from the president that.

659
00:34:34.873 --> 00:34:36.875
yes. I want to see more on

660
00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:40.011
what a unilateral military raid
would look like‐‐

661
00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:43.848
you know. again. I had been
driving this solo. but obviously

662
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:46.685
we were going to have to call
more folks in to do that.

663
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.754
‐ I knew the senior leadership
of the raid force.

664
00:34:49.988 --> 00:34:53.658
These were folks that I had
worked with off and on.

665
00:34:53.892 --> 00:34:57.162
and I think very positively.
since 9/11.

666
00:34:57.395 --> 00:35:00.899
And I knew that they
were finest of the finest.

667
00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:04.402
‐ The ground force commander
was an experienced operator.

668
00:35:04.636 --> 00:35:06.237
and he had been in command

669
00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:08.740
of his squadron for a while.
and had done a couple

670
00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:10.675
of operational deployments
with them.

671
00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:14.546
‐ I had exceptional confidence
in this particular officer.

672
00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.948
He had worked for me
for many years.

673
00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:18.984
had a tremendous amount
of combat experience.

674
00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:21.753
very heroic in combat.

675
00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:25.390
very level‐headed.
would not rush to failure.

676
00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:30.228
‐ The aviation lead
is very quiet.

677
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:34.099
but he had a tremendous amount
of flying experience

678
00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.568
and had been involved
in a number of operations

679
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.069
and had flown me
a number of places

680
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.038
and flown all of us
a number of places.

681
00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:43.541
You needed somebody who not only
knew how to fly the bird.

682
00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:47.112
but understood everything else
about terrain masking

683
00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:49.547
and enemy radars.

684
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:52.951
‐ I was brought into this
small room of less than

685
00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:57.455
a dozen individuals and
was given a piece of imagery

686
00:35:57.689 --> 00:35:59.524
in Abbottabad. Pakistan.

687
00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:01.292
And I'm looking at
a ground force commander

688
00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:06.931
who I have risked my life for.
for him and his teams.

689
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:10.769
And when they told me that
we're going after bin Laden.

690
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.338
my only reaction is
like. let's go.

691
00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:17.642
And I looked at the map.
and I looked at the distance

692
00:36:17.876 --> 00:36:20.011
on the map. I looked
at the capability.

693
00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:22.814
and my first reaction
is absolutely. we can do this.

694
00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:25.984
But there's going to be risk and
we need to reduce that risk.

695
00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:28.853
‐ It looked like an awful lot
of other raids we have done

696
00:36:29.087 --> 00:36:32.257
except the the distance
was a long way.

697
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.826
So the helicopter piece
was very complicated.

698
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.631
‐ You're still trying to fly
at 130. 150 miles an hour.

699
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.067
you know. 100 or 200 feet
off the ground.

700
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.169
looking for wires.
looking for birds.

701
00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.304
looking for antennas and towers.

702
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:50.341
Looking for the terrain.
you're still flying the aircraft

703
00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:53.078
while you're managing
the electronic spectrum

704
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:54.846
that's trying to
search and find you.

705
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.347
(Lead Planner)
Anything we asked for. we got.

706
00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.385
If we needed an analysis
of all of the radars

707
00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.687
in the entire region.
then we got that.

708
00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:05.790
We got the best analysts for
whatever radars were required.

709
00:37:06.024 --> 00:37:07.192
‐ Am I gonna be heard.

710
00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:10.729
am I going to be seen
visually. electronically?

711
00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.931
How noisy am I
in that country?

712
00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:16.267
(narrator)
But radar's not
the only concern.

713
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:19.304
If the American helicopters
are discovered.

714
00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:23.308
can the Pakistani Air Force
track and shoot them down?

715
00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:24.976
‐ For example. the training

716
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.413
of those that
are flying F‐16s

717
00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:32.016
or other helicopters
in a specific country.

718
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.919
you would want to know
how proficient are they.

719
00:37:35.153 --> 00:37:36.521
Even though they have
the equipment

720
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.491
on board that airframe.
do they know how to use it?

721
00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:42.560
Do they know how to
operate it in day

722
00:37:42.794 --> 00:37:44.763
and equally as proficient
at night?

723
00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.297
(Lead Planner)
Given the geography

724
00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:49.868
of the part of the country where
the mission was going to be.

725
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.504
we had learned over
the years operating that

726
00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:58.009
the MH‐47 Chinooks were the best
platform for the elevation

727
00:37:58.243 --> 00:37:59.410
and for the types of weather

728
00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:00.879
that we would need
to fly through.

729
00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:03.414
Their ability to carry
a larger number of people

730
00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:04.816
was also important.

731
00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:07.952
So from the beginning.
we saw it as a 47 mission.

732
00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:09.721
as a mission for the Chinooks.

733
00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.156
(Aviation Planner)
The Chinook is very loud.

734
00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:14.926
It's very big. it's visible
across all spectrums.

735
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.796
‐ As the briefs went through
the chain of command.

736
00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:23.668
there was a sensitivity
expressed on exposure to radars

737
00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:27.338
and discovery of the helicopters
as the force was infiltrating.

738
00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:31.242
And that shifted
the conversation to using

739
00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:34.813
the Black Hawks that had some
of the capabilities

740
00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.714
to defeat radar.

741
00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:41.853
And that assuaged the concerns
at the national level.

742
00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.421
‐ Black Hawks can get in and out

743
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:45.723
of certain areas quicker
than a Chinook can.

744
00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:47.725
(narrator)
Though the Black Hawks are
more maneuverable

745
00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:49.928
and better shielded
from radar detection.

746
00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.164
they cannot carry enough
fuel for the round trip.

747
00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:57.302
and will need to be refueled
inside Pakistan.

748
00:38:57.535 --> 00:39:01.306
‐ The contingent part of
the planning was that

749
00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.575
we would need
refueling helicopters.

750
00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:09.881
We would need the 47s to fly in
and park on the way back out

751
00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.749
so that the Black Hawks
could refuel.

752
00:39:11.983 --> 00:39:14.519
And they would set up
a ground refueling site.

753
00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:16.654
Black Hawks would land.
take fuel on.

754
00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:19.090
and then everybody
would fly out.

755
00:39:19.324 --> 00:39:23.995
‐ I'd been in the White House
almost exactly 30 years earlier

756
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:28.433
for the Iranian hostage
rescue mission.

757
00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:32.837
which failed due to problems
with helicopters.

758
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:38.710
So in those discussions about
the raid on Abbottabad. I said.

759
00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:41.779
I think you need to add
another helicopter or two

760
00:39:42.013 --> 00:39:46.684
to your plan just in case
something goes south.

761
00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:48.920
(narrator)
Ultimately. two Black Hawks

762
00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:52.390
carrying the primary assault
force will lead the way.

763
00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:54.392
followed by two larger Chinooks

764
00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:58.963
with a fuel supply and
a contingency force of SEALs.

765
00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:03.534
‐ It was in the end
the president that added

766
00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:06.070
the extra helicopters
to the force

767
00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:09.007
to be able to give them
the possibility of fighting out.

768
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.910
I mean. part of our worst
nightmare would have been

769
00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:13.344
one. we don't get him.

770
00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:16.214
and two. we have
US military personnel

771
00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.683
who are captured
inside Pakistan.

772
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:27.892
(narrator)
For all the detailed
planning involved

773
00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:31.529
in sending Navy SEALs after
Osama bin Laden.

774
00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:33.331
nothing can change
the greatest risk of

775
00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:36.301
Operation Neptune Spear.

776
00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:39.337
American forces will be
deep inside Pakistan

777
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.573
without permission.

778
00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:46.878
To improve the odds of success.
the SEALs focus on the ways

779
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:51.382
the mission could fail and how
to prevent a disastrous outcome.

780
00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.051
(Adm. McRaven) Normally on
a compound this size.

781
00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:57.989
we probably would have
had a SEAL force of.

782
00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:02.026
you know. 25 guys.
just the assault element.

783
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.830
and then probably another
30 or more Rangers

784
00:41:06.064 --> 00:41:08.399
that would be kind of
the outer security element.

785
00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:11.936
Well. I had to make do
with just the 24 SEALs

786
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.273
and our one interpreter
and the dog.

787
00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:18.509
That was the maximum I could fit
on the helicopters based on

788
00:41:18.743 --> 00:41:21.346
the altitude of Abbottabad.
and the heat at the time.

789
00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:23.014
(Aviation Planner)
The hotter it gets.

790
00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.782
the higher
the density altitude is

791
00:41:25.016 --> 00:41:26.951
and the less people we can bring
to an objective.

792
00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:29.087
That's really what it
boils down to.

793
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.156
So May really was
the last comfort zone.

794
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.992
Beyond that. we were gonna
start incurring more risk.

795
00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:37.695
'cause June. it gets very hot.
it's in the hundreds for a high.

796
00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:40.098
‐ Everybody who was on that
mission was handpicked.

797
00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.133
Everyone on that mission
had combat experience.

798
00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:43.534
a lot of combat experience.

799
00:41:43.768 --> 00:41:46.571
‐ It was the three of us. me.
the squadron commander.

800
00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:49.774
and the squadron master chief
sitting and going through.

801
00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:52.443
And the primary criteria we used

802
00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:55.079
was could the operator

803
00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:59.150
snap right in and
just do the op?

804
00:41:59.384 --> 00:42:02.020
And that doesn't necessarily
have to do with your seniority.

805
00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:05.556
your experience level.
what we wanted was temperament.

806
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.025
‐ There's multiple teams at home

807
00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:08.860
and different levels
of readiness

808
00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:11.362
on standby and preparation.

809
00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:14.999
We were kind of the most
off the grid squadron

810
00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:17.001
because we had just got home.
it shouldn't have been our time

811
00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:20.405
to rotate back over
for many more months.

812
00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:23.608
‐ We'd finished a few weeks
of leave with our families.

813
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:25.943
and then we started
training again.

814
00:42:26.177 --> 00:42:28.780
So guys split up in
the typical training cycle.

815
00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:32.984
‐ I got recalled when I was at
Free‐Fall Jumpmaster School.

816
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.987
‐ I think we were in lock
picking school or something.

817
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.822
All of a sudden things
started spinning up.

818
00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:40.124
they said. hey. we need
these people back.

819
00:42:40.358 --> 00:42:41.859
‐ You know. there's
obviously luck involved.

820
00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:43.394
but they picked
the most experienced guys

821
00:42:43.628 --> 00:42:46.364
of the available guys in
the search spot they wanted.

822
00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:47.932
‐ Nobody knew where these guys
were. they just assumed

823
00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:49.267
they were on leave
with their family.

824
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.602
or Disneyland or someplace.

825
00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:54.539
So that gave me three weeks of
kind of cover for action.

826
00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.609
We actually brought
these 25 guys in

827
00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:00.445
to this undisclosed location

828
00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.113
and briefed them.

829
00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:04.315
‐ We're traditionally set up
in different troops.

830
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:10.021
and they pulled the 24 most
senior guys from the squadron.

831
00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:12.723
So it's a little different.
but. okay.

832
00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.492
‐ I wasn't a very senior guy.

833
00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:16.094
The reason I got chosen for
the mission was because

834
00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.995
I was a dog handler
and I had Cairo.

835
00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:19.497
The dog would be
very valuable in smelling

836
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.166
any sort of explosive.
finding any escape tunnels.

837
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.469
safe rooms. crowd control.

838
00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.003
‐ We were just talking about
why are we back?

839
00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:28.005
What kind of stupid
training exercise

840
00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:29.841
did they just come up
with us to do?

841
00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:31.209
And they brought us in a room

842
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.312
and they told us it wasn't
a training exercise.

843
00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:37.682
this is definitely real. but we
just have to go get something

844
00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:40.218
and bring it back to them
so they can see it.

845
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.719
‐ It was pretty vague

846
00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:43.354
to say that they needed us
for something.

847
00:43:43.588 --> 00:43:44.956
A couple rumors were
flying around.

848
00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.124
‐ Then we just started assuming

849
00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:47.458
what it could be around
the world.

850
00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:49.427
but no one thought
bin Laden off the bat.

851
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.296
They drove us down to
a base south of Virginia.

852
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.566
and the boss came in and just
said. all right. guys.

853
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.069
the reason that you're here
is because this is as close as

854
00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.171
we've ever been
to Osama bin Laden.

855
00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:02.673
‐ And immediately.
game faces were on

856
00:44:02.907 --> 00:44:06.010
and they began to to plan
and rehearse the mission.

857
00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:07.311
We only had three weeks
to do that.

858
00:44:07.545 --> 00:44:10.381
♪

859
00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:16.487
(Long)
As part of any operation.

860
00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:20.525
NGA develops
three dimensional models

861
00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:23.828
that you can fly through to.
you know. make you think

862
00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.630
like you are actually there.

863
00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:28.599
and we also developed
a scale model.

864
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:32.637
And then that scale model
was used to develop

865
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.172
a full scale model.

866
00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.174
‐ Whether it's SEALS.
whether Delta Force.

867
00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:37.842
we all do this kinda
the same way.

868
00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:38.943
everyone gets a say.

869
00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:40.378
Everyone looked at
that target.

870
00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:43.447
Everyone had access
to the information.

871
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.016
‐ We spent all morning
standing around the model.

872
00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.350
and everybody chalk talking.

873
00:44:46.584 --> 00:44:48.686
hey. how we would tactically
take this down?

874
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.755
‐ If you were going to fast rope
here. here. here. here.

875
00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.423
‐ The plan was straightforward.

876
00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:55.426
Two helicopters flying
to the target.

877
00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.262
One helicopter would hover

878
00:44:58.496 --> 00:45:02.266
over the roof of
the three‐story building.

879
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.970
and a small force would
fast rope down onto the roof.

880
00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:08.206
get right down to the balcony.

881
00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.007
and come right in on
the third floor

882
00:45:10.241 --> 00:45:12.543
where everybody assessed
that's where he lived.

883
00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:17.281
The second helicopter would be
hovering over the courtyard

884
00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:21.118
and fast rope the majority of
the force down onto the ground.

885
00:45:21.352 --> 00:45:24.689
where they would set up
sniper positions on the walls

886
00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:27.992
and clear the second building
in the compound

887
00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:31.596
and then clear the main building
from the ground up.

888

(narrator)
Training for the mission moves

889
00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:35.266
to a facility in
North Carolina

890
00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:39.437
where the ground force runs
through their raid assignments.

891
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.707
By mid‐April. the training
shifts to the mountains of

892
00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.477
the western United States.
where the weather and terrain

893
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:50.114
are closer to flight conditions
in Pakistan.

894
00:45:50.348 --> 00:45:51.616
(Adm. McRaven)
One of the things that

895
00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:53.951
I wanted to do was to duplicate

896
00:45:54.185 --> 00:45:58.122
as best we could the entire
profile of the mission.

897
00:45:58.356 --> 00:45:59.790
And there were a number of
folks that said. sir.

898
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:01.592
we know to fly a helicopter.
we know how to fly a helicopter

899
00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:03.594
for 169 miles.

900
00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:06.397
we just kind of fly
and come into the mockup.

901
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:09.533
I said. no. no. we are going
to fly for 169 miles.

902
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:12.937
we are gonna go through the
exact profile as best we can.

903
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.007
‐ We are being observed
by senior members of

904
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.642
the US government military

905
00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.878
because they want
to make sure that we.

906
00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:24.849
as one of their options.
are capable.

907
00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:27.518
But they knew who we were.
and I think that a lot of them

908
00:46:27.752 --> 00:46:29.820
just wanted to make sure
that helicopters could fly

909
00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:31.322
the way they wanted them to.

910
00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:34.091
‐ The number one contingency
that was the most probable

911
00:46:34.325 --> 00:46:37.762
was an aircraft crashing
in country.

912
00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:40.031
(narrator)
The Western rehearsals focus on

913
00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:42.199
how the Black Hawks
will perform.

914
00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:44.468
Though they have been
developed for situations

915
00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:46.003
just like this one.

916
00:46:46.237 --> 00:46:49.640
they have never before been
flown on an actual mission.

917
00:46:49.874 --> 00:46:50.975
(Commander Master Chief)
Very early on when

918
00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.643
we got out and saw them fly.

919
00:46:52.877 --> 00:46:56.080
they were unstable. particularly
when they came in to hover.

920
00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:57.748
And I said. hey. you know.
with all due respect.

921
00:46:57.982 --> 00:46:59.750
I don't think we should use
these helicopters.

922
00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:02.286
The time to try something new is
not on the most important raid

923
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.822
arguably since World War Two.

924
00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:06.657
(Lead Planner)
Another one of the factors

925
00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:08.492
we had to take into account was

926
00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:10.127
that the air crews flying

927
00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:12.963
the Black Hawks had been
in a separate program

928
00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.700
and didn't have a lot of time
flying overseas.

929
00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:19.270
‐ The hot crews
were less seasoned.

930
00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.005
just the true knowledge
of that environment

931
00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.407
that those Hawker's
just did not have.

932
00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:26.811
And those particular crews had
been taken out of the fight

933
00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.980
for a while and really had been
part of just research.

934
00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:34.151
‐ The closer that we got to
the day we're going to launch.

935
00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:36.320
they did decide to forward
deploy us to Afghanistan

936
00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:37.888
and that's when it sunk in.
like. they're serious about this

937
00:47:38.122 --> 00:47:39.357
and we're probably
going to do it.

938
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.726
(Seal #4)
They gave us a weekend off.

939
00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:45.096
and I'm in my neighborhood.

940
00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.398
There's like. kids running
around collecting Easter eggs.

941
00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:49.500
I'm talking to my neighbor.
he knows I'm a SEAL

942
00:47:49.734 --> 00:47:52.203
but clearly has no idea
what's going on.

943
00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:53.537
And as the kids
are running around.

944
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:55.373
he's sitting there kind of
complaining to me

945
00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.341
about how stressed
he is at work.

946
00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.343
"I got this going on next week.
and this going on next week.

947
00:47:59.577 --> 00:48:01.846
I'm so stressed."
and I remember kind of chuckling

948
00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:04.248
in the back of my mind thinking

949
00:48:04.482 --> 00:48:06.016
you have no idea what
I got going on next week.

950
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:11.088
And a day later. we got
the green light and we left.

951
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.895
(narrator)
With the SEALs now deployed

952
00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:20.030
in Afghanistan waiting
for a green light.

953
00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:24.001
President Obama faces
a momentous decision.

954
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:26.837
Will he send them into
Pakistan without knowing

955
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:30.741
whether Osama bin Laden
is really there?

956
00:48:30.975 --> 00:48:35.279
On Thursday. April 28. 2011.
the president meets with

957
00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:37.782
his National Security Council.

958
00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:40.117
‐ We had pretty much
gone through

959
00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:42.653
all the options.
all the data.

960
00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:46.590
We had gone...

961
00:48:46.824 --> 00:48:49.293
at our basic premises
and examined them

962
00:48:49.527 --> 00:48:53.364
and turned them over and did
our best to break them down.

963
00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:56.233
(Panetta) The president
then basically opened it up

964
00:48:56.467 --> 00:48:57.768
and said. what do you think?

965
00:48:58.002 --> 00:48:59.703
What do you think?

966
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:02.339
I remember a lot of differences.

967
00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.111
I'd have to say just...

968
00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:09.547
thinking about this. I think
a majority of the people there

969
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.649
were concerned that
it was too risky.

970
00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:15.152
‐ There is no assurance
that if we wait.

971
00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:18.956
we will get more positive
information that he's there.

972
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:23.060
And the longer it goes on.
the more likely it is to leak.

973
00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:28.532
And so that kind of brought it
to a head in terms of

974
00:49:28.766 --> 00:49:30.734
we're not gonna get
any better information.

975
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:32.970
So this is what we have.

976
00:49:33.204 --> 00:49:34.738
make your decision
based on that.

977
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:37.875
‐ We thought it would be
important to so‐called

978
00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:39.610
"red team" the issue.

979
00:49:39.844 --> 00:49:43.180
which meant having a group
go in and ask nothing

980
00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:47.585
but the questions about what
are other possibilities.

981
00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.387
And they did that.
the red team did that.

982
00:49:50.621 --> 00:49:53.557
They basically said. look.
you know. we've looked

983
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.561
at the possibility. you know.
that it's not bin Laden.

984
00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:59.230
but somebody else.

985
00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.564
But the question then becomes.

986
00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:03.234
why are bin Laden's
couriers there?

987
00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:08.572
‐ I think that
all of us would say that

988
00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:14.011
it was maybe a 55‐45 call.

989
00:50:14.245 --> 00:50:17.948
Effectively.
there was no way for us

990
00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:21.252
to absolutely confirm that
it was bin Laden.

991
00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:24.421
at least not within
a meaningful timeframe.

992
00:50:24.655 --> 00:50:25.956
So it was a judgment call.

993
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:32.229
It's only after examining
every single option militarily

994
00:50:32.463 --> 00:50:35.165
that finally I'm presented
with the decision.

995
00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:38.836
And so I left the Situation Room
saying. thank you very much.

996
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:41.605
I'll be making a decision
over the next 24 hours.

997
00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:45.009
‐ I worked for President Obama
for four years.

998
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.778
And let me just tell you.

999
00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:49.680
I would never play poker
with that guy.

1000
00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:54.118
Impossible to read.

1001
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:59.790
‐ I said to myself that if
I have an opportunity

1002
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.426
to get bin Laden
and we pass it up.

1003
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:08.699
then that is a huge blow
to the cause of justice.

1004
00:51:08.933 --> 00:51:12.937
to the families of 9/11 victims
that I had met.

1005
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.574
and it was worth the risk.

1006
00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:21.078
‐ And the word came back in
the morning through Tom Donnelly

1007
00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:24.381
that it was a go
for Saturday night.

1008
00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:25.983
Sunday morning. Pakistan time.

1009
00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:28.652
But it was pretty clear.
I think. by noon

1010
00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:30.621
that Admiral McRaven
was not comfortable

1011
00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:34.358
with the environmental
conditions that night.

1012
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:36.994
And so he decided
to delay 24 hours.

1013
00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:41.165
‐ It was a little bit foggy.
and I was a little concerned

1014
00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:42.766
about the helicopters going
through there.

1015
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.903
Not tremendously concerned.
but I wanted it to be.

1016
00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.371
you know. the best conditions
I could get.

1017
00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:49.173
we knew Sunday
would be better.

1018
00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:51.175
‐ We're literally sitting
in a brief.

1019
00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:53.277
Our master chief walks in the
back door of the briefing room.

1020
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.312
says. hey. guys. green light.
we're going tomorrow.

1021
00:51:55.546 --> 00:51:58.382
‐ So once that happens.
you know. it is what it is.

1022
00:51:58.616 --> 00:51:59.883
And. you know.
you're just making sure

1023
00:52:00.184 --> 00:52:02.186
all your gear's ready.
making sure your guns are ready.

1024
00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:04.788
Just everything. you know.

1025
00:52:05.022 --> 00:52:07.591
your shoelaces don't have a tear
in it or anything like that.

1026
00:52:07.825 --> 00:52:12.796
You got 24 hours to kind of
prepare for what. I mean.

1027
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.766
in essence. is probably
the rest of your life.

1028
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.401
And that's kind of how I felt.

1029
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.403
‐ Oh yeah. it was very clear

1030
00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:21.071
that we probably would
be making it back.

1031
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:24.541
It was‐‐ every guy that was
chosen for the mission.

1032
00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:26.210
made sure their million dollar
life insurance policy

1033
00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:29.680
was fulfilled.

1034
00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.749
I told my parents.
or at least I told my father.

1035
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.717
I probably would be
making it back.

1036
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:36.353
‐ It was the first time I wrote
a letter to. you know.

1037
00:52:36.587 --> 00:52:38.022
my kid and my wife.

1038
00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.757
I hadn't done that before.

1039
00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:44.561
‐ We had a day. actually.
to look over the plan. you know.

1040
00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:47.698
one final time.
spent some time talking

1041
00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.767
to the ground force commander
and the weather guys.

1042
00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:52.436
and we kind of went through
our normal day on Saturday.

1043
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:56.273
On Sunday. I actually had
a congressional delegation in.

1044
00:52:56.507 --> 00:52:59.677
I didn't want to change any of
my routine because most of

1045
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:04.081
the people from my command.
we were in Bagram.

1046
00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.616
had no idea we were doing this.

1047
00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.117
Went through
the congressional delegation.

1048
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:09.486
and then very quickly
after that.

1049
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.058
moved down to our small command
center there in Jalalabad.

1050
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.528
‐ And the force is ready.

1051
00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.263
now you're waiting for
the green light.

Operation Neptune Spear sets off
on a moonless night

1054
00:53:32.076 --> 00:53:35.579
for a residential compound
in Abbottabad. Pakistan.

1055
00:53:35.813 --> 00:53:38.649
Two Black Hawk helicopters.

an interpreter.
and a combat dog.

1058
00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:48.025
The helicopters
are so tight on weight

1059
00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.526
that their standard
weapons systems

1060
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.895
are taken off and left behind.

1061
00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:54.465
‐ We're all mingling. you know.
saying hi to your friends

1062
00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:56.300
in the other helicopter.
just saying. hey.

1063
00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:57.935
we'll see you in 90 minutes.

1064
00:53:58.168 --> 00:53:59.670
‐ We had all of
our stuff stripped.

1065
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:02.072
No jewelry. nothing.
no name tags.

1066
00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:04.475
‐ There was a sense that
this was historic.

1067
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:07.845
What they were about to do was.
to the best of their ability.

1068
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:10.681
bring distinction on themselves.
their unit and their country.

1069
00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.282
and they certainly felt that.

1070
00:54:12.516 --> 00:54:13.951
‐ I was doing
a video teleconference

1071
00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:17.221
back with Director Panetta
and then the Situation Room.

1072
00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:19.556
At the appropriate
point in time.

1073
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:23.894
I turned to the SEAL commander.

1074
00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:26.130

(narrator) The Black Hawks
have 169 miles to cover

1078

(Aviation Planner)
The routing was not direct

1080
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.982
by design.
the routing for

1081
00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:48.018
the Black Hawks was to take
the least risked route.

wires. cultural.
whatever it may be.

1084
00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:56.393
It was for them to loop around
to reduce the amount of risk

1085
00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:58.729
to gain the element of surprise
on the objective.

1086
00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.464
‐ The risk on
the helicopter ride. I mean.

1087
00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.499
that's the one thing that
we couldn't control.

1088
00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:03.967
I think that was
definitely the one thing

1089
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:05.636
I was more worried about.

1090
00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.504
‐ And we just kinda reflect on
everything's gonna happen.

1091
00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:10.340
And eventually at some point.
it does sink in. though.

1092

It's like. holy crap.
we're here. this is us.

1093

Doing this for the people

Stuff like that's
kind of sinking in.

The deeper you get
into Pakistan.

it's more structured.
much more advanced.

the densely populated areas.

The Blackhawks approached

00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:28.118
the compound from the east.
using the starker terrain

1124
00:56:28.352 --> 00:56:30.454
to muffle the sound
of their arrival.

1125
00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:34.491
In planning. they had figured
that they would be identifiable

1126
00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:37.227
for no more than the last
two minutes of the flight.

1127
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:40.864
(SEAL #5)
The ten minute call is really

1128
00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:43.934
when everything starts kind of
getting alive in the cabin.

1129
00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:47.104
You're double checking
your optics.

1130
00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:48.538
you're double checking
your night vision.

gets tightened up.

‐ Two minutes.
you open the doors.

1133

One minute. you swing
your feet out

00:56:54.278 --> 00:56:55.779
and let them hang in the breeze.

1135
00:56:56.013 --> 00:56:58.515
Um. you're getting your rope
ready to go. right?

1136
00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:01.985
You're 30 seconds out.
now you're in. you know?

1137
00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:03.787
At 30 seconds out.
I can look out the door.

1138
00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:06.089
I can look up. I can see
the compound coming.

Above the compound.

The iconic picture that
Pete Souza's taken

1145
00:57:27.077 --> 00:57:31.882
records. essentially.
what the atmosphere was like.

1146
00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:35.218
We're stuffed into
a pretty small room.

1147
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:39.089
‐ We're watching
the helicopters come in.

1148
00:57:39.323 --> 00:57:42.793
and there is a point at which

1149
00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:47.431
I see one of these helicopters
begin to shake.

1150
00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:51.268
And clearly. there's been
a loss of control.

1151
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.338
(SEAL #4)
Immediately you can tell

1152
00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:56.340
something was was off.
something was wrong.

1153
00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:59.242
We were not hovering like
we did in training.

1154
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.345
In my mind. it felt
like about an hour.

1155
00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.246
in reality was probably
about five seconds.

1156
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.817
I'm sitting in the door
waiting to push the rope out.

1157
00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:08.885
grab the rope. slide down
and go to work.

1158
00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:13.156
Couldn't get stable.
couldn't get stable.

1159
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.225
(SEAL #5) Right then we kind
of sunk just a little bit.

1160
00:58:15.459 --> 00:58:16.727
is what I felt.
and then we kind of

1161
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.929
turned the tail.
kicked out to the left.

1162
00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:22.566
Once that happened. then we just
started sideswiping left

1163
00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:24.534
and losing altitude.

1164
00:58:24.768 --> 00:58:26.169

Helicopters don't crash

1165
00:58:26.403 --> 00:58:28.005
like planes. come skidding in.

1166
00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.540
They're usually pretty ugly.
and we're crashing to the side

1167
00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:32.943
at about 40 feet.
and I'm in this door.

1168
00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.811
Now we're crashing.
and everybody's wanting

1169
00:58:35.045 --> 00:58:37.814
back in and away from
the open door.

1170
00:58:38.048 --> 00:58:40.317
Instinctually.
that's when I started grabbing

1171
00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:43.086
the guys in front of me to make
sure that they didn't fall out.

1172
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.289
‐ Here you are in probably
the highest profile mission

1173
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:48.925
in special operations history.
maybe the military.

1174
00:58:49.159 --> 00:58:53.830
We might lose a whole helo full
of tier one operators.

1175
00:58:54.064 --> 00:58:55.932
We're a sovereign nation.

1176
00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:59.336
The military academy's
right across the way.

1177
00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:03.473
We're kind of screwed here
if this is what we think it is.

1178
00:59:11.148 --> 00:59:13.050
(narrator)
Just before 1:00 am.

1179
00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.685
as the first of the two
American Black Hawks moves

1180
00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:16.520
into position above
the compound.

1181
00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:19.389
it starts losing lift.

1182
00:59:19.623 --> 00:59:22.692
‐ During training. the mock
compound had been surrounded by

1183
00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.361
a chain link fence.

1184
00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:29.566
but the actual compound is set
inside tall. solid walls.

1185
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.436
‐ Chain link allows
the wind to push through.

1186
00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.438
And so it gave a false sensation

1187
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:37.908
of what the lift capability
was for those air crews.

1188
00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:39.443
(narrator)
But another factor may also

1189
00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:42.079
have figured in
the Black Hawk's problem.

1190
00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:44.214
Temperatures are
substantially higher

1191
00:59:44.448 --> 00:59:46.083
than they had anticipated.

1192
00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:47.951
(Aviation Planner)
Every degree centigrade

1193
00:59:48.185 --> 00:59:49.352
does reduce
a significant amount

1194
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.621
of lift just based on
their density.

1195
00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:54.791
And the Hawk crews were
believing it was going to be

1196
00:59:55.025 --> 00:59:55.959
eight to ten degrees cooler.

1197
00:59:56.193 --> 00:59:58.261
‐ They planned against
nicer conditions

1198
00:59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.530
or lower temperatures.
and they got out there

1199
01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.733
and the aircraft did
what would naturally happen

1200
01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.268
when it doesn't have
the ability to perform

1201
01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:07.504
under those conditions.

1202
01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.172
(narrator)
As the helicopter falters.

1203
01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:11.708
long hours of training kick in.

1204
01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:16.713
‐ One of the contingencies
we rehearsed numerous times was

1205
01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:20.851
if anything happened
to that first helicopter.

1206
01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.587
if the pilot was able to.
he would bump over

1207
01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.156
the enclosed driveway and into
what we called the animal pen.

1208
01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:30.494
‐ We impacted.
there's a large wall

1209
01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:32.562
that circles the compound.

1210
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.432
Our tail section hung up
on the wall.

1211
01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:38.502
and we kind of look like
a lawn dart stuck over the wall.

1212
01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.071
The tail section of
the helicopter has a wheel

1213
01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.673
for the load‐bearing section
of the Black Hawk.

1214
01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.409
That wheel landed
on top of the wall.

1215
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.179
Had that wheel bent eight inches
this way or this way.

1216
01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.014
it would have broken
the tail section.

1217
01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:53.150
We wouldn't be talking today.

1218
01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:56.286
I kind of waited for
what I assumed would be next.

1219
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.623
was some sort of explosion or
something. but that never came.

1220
01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.758
And now the guys who were
sitting behind me.

1221
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.360
who were holding me in
are now yelling at me.

1222
01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.728
telling me to hurry up
and get out.

1223
01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.730
(chuckling)
God. give me a second.

1224
01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:09.432
I gotta take a couple
deep breaths here.

1225
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.568
(Adm. McRaven) People are moving
around the outside.

1226
01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:15.038
That says to me that
at least some are uninjured

1227
01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:18.175
and the helo seems to be upright
'cause I saw people come out

1228
01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.177
from both sides
of the helicopter.

1229
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.378
So it hadn't rolled over
because I could still

1230
01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:22.913
see the rotor blades.

1231
01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:26.082
‐ That ground force and crew
is living today because

1232
01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.952
of the expertise and the ability
for that pilot to maneuver

1233
01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:30.787
that aircraft where it did.

1234
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:35.058
‐ When the helicopter
went down at Abbottabad.

1235
01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.360
I thought I was gonna
have a heart attack.

1236
01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:41.131
Oh no. not again.
not 30 years later.

1237
01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.699
But the difference in
the equipment.

1238
01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.068
the difference in the training.
the difference in the caliber

1239
01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:49.439
of the people involved turned
what could have been a disaster

1240
01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:51.408
into an inconvenience.

1241
01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:57.914
‐ That doesn't mean that you
didn't get a little knot inside

1242
01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:01.785
when we heard that there had
been a problem with the tail

1243
01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.154
of the helicopter
hitting the wall.

1244
01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:08.458
And we recognized it was
going to make extraction

1245
01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:11.528
more complicated than
originally planned.

1246
01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.863
(SEAL #4)
Chalk two. he's coming in.

1247
01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.966
He has no idea if
we'd been shot down.

1248
01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.602
a mechanical issue.
has no idea what's happened.

1249
01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.938
In a second after witnessing
our helo was down.

1250
01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:23.506
he didn't make a radio call.

1251
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.675
he didn't try to push
the envelope in the wrong way.

1252
01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.545
He simply hovered his helicopter
out outside the compound.

1253
01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.380
landed him on the ground.

1254
01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:32.449
We jumped out. ran around
the other side.

1255
01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.618
underside of the helo.
linked up with the guys

1256
01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.286
on the other side of the bird.

1257
01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:39.122
explosively breached one gate.
and within about a minute.

1258
01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:40.490
we were back into the location

1259
01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:42.859
where we would have
fast roped into initially.

1260
01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.295
(SEAL #5) As soon as we
funneled into the compound.

1261
01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:47.264
we knew exactly where
we needed to go

1262
01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:50.467
and guys started breaking off
and took their responsibilities.

1263
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.670
‐ The guy in the south
guesthouse was one of theirs.

1264
01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:55.505
Go up to the guest house.
check the door. right?

1265
01:02:55.739 --> 01:02:58.074
It's locked. When you're
a bad guy's house

1266
01:02:58.308 --> 01:02:59.843
and you've just beat
on his front door for about

1267
01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:02.412
a minute and a half.
what you don't want to do

1268
01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:03.880
is stand in front of the door.

1269
01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:05.915
And so I was I was on my knee

1270
01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:07.851
as low as I could
to the side of the door.

1271
01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.186
put a little explosive
charge on it.

1272
01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.521
‐ Immediately.
as they began to move.

1273
01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:13.123
we got the call that
shots were fired.

1274
01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:16.126
(SEAL #4) AK‐47 starts shooting
right through the door.

1275
01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:18.595
Thankfully. I was on my knee.

1276
01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:21.564
My partner and I at the door
returned fire through the door.

1277
01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:25.402
Everything goes quiet.
okay. now what do we do?

1278
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.736
Right. we still gotta
get in the room.

1279
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.104
still gotta figure out
what's going on.

1280
01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:29.306
Did he take his gun
and go into the back room

1281
01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.607
or did we kill him
and is he laying

1282
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.876
the other side of the door.
I don't know.

1283
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.278
This happened
very. very quickly.

1284
01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.148
Door opens up. it was a female
holding the little kid.

1285
01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.650
Like. two or three kids
behind her holding her hand.

1286
01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:42.719
Her husband was laying there
dead inside the door.

1287
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.124
(SEAL #1)
On the northeast corner.

1288
01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:49.759
there's a door we can get into.

1289
01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.128
One of the breachers went up
with a big bomb

1290
01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:54.597
and put it on the door.
and that one you heard.

1291
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.700
The door did open but there's
a brick wall behind it.

1292
01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.335
It was a fake door
to fake out people

1293
01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.869
that might be looking
at the compound.

1294
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.472
That was the first indicator
this is a high value target.

1295
01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:05.041
‐ One of our team inside ran to
the main gate. opened it up.

1296
01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:06.710
and let them in.

1297
01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.378
They came in and then
everybody starts flooding

1298
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.314
the main three‐story compound.

1299
01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:13.817
‐ Once the SEALs went
into the compound.

1300
01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.419
we no longer saw anything
on our screens.

1301
01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:17.887
And so we were waiting.

1302
01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:19.222
‐ We didn't have helmet cams.

1303
01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:21.124
so I wasn't seeing
the action unfold.

1304
01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:22.559
(gunfire)

1305
01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.461
‐ There was the other
Kuwaiti brother and his wife

1306
01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.296
killed on the first floor.

1307
01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:27.931
He was going for a gun
and the female

1308
01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:30.934
was trying to protect him.

1309
01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:33.770
‐ I was able to see the guys
in front of me already

1310
01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:35.739
working problems.
different breaching problems.

1311
01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.140
Nobody hesitated.

1312
01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.975
The entire thing could be
rigged to blow up.

1313
01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.610
If anyone's gonna martyr
himself and his whole family

1314
01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:43.146
it's Osama bin Laden. but we
just continue to move forward.

1315
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.882
‐ To go up the stairs.
there was a heavy metal door

1316
01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:47.450
built into the stairwell

1317
01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:51.621
that blocked the upstairs
from downstairs.

1318
01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:53.957
That was a sign.
hey. who has a metal door

1319
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:55.458
at the bottom of their stairs?

1320
01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:56.960
We explosively
breached that.

1321
01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:59.963
and then made our way up
to the second floor.

1322
01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.865
House is pitch black. right?

1323
01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.700
No electricity. no lights on.

1324
01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.668
they had coverings on
all the windows.

1325
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.237
There's a set of
stairs that go up.

1326
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.806
there's a landing. and then it
goes up to the third floor.

1327
01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.875
‐ Guys were moving upstairs
the way we always had

1328
01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.477
in every shoot house
that we'd work through.

1329
01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:17.414
‐ By the time I got there.
there was a SEAL in front of me

1330
01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.482
who'd just taken a couple shots.

1331
01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:22.419
He's calm enough in this
situation to say. okay. well.

1332
01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.888
I just saw a head peek
around the corner.

1333
01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.624
I'm betting it's Khalid.
bin Laden's son.

1334
01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.559
I'm gonna whisper his name.

1335
01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:31.661
Nobody told him to do this.
he just dreamed this all up

1336
01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.696
in the moment.
in the middle of the raid.

1337
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.100
three minutes after crashing
the helicopter and almost dying.

1338
01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.269
Literally whispers his name.

1339
01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.070
Khalid pops around
the corner and gets shot.

1340
01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:46.643
As we moved up the stairs
and stepped over Khalid's body.

1341
01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:49.446
he had an AK‐47 there.
locked and loaded.

1342
01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:53.516
round in the chamber.
off safe and ready to go.

1343
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.518
‐ One guy goes this way.
the other guy goes that way.

1344
01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:58.321
A handful of guys went over
the top of Khalid.

1345
01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:01.124
moved to the second floor
of the house.

1346
01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.594
Once the second floor
was cleared.

1347
01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:06.663
the team moved up the stairs.

1348
01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.303
Shots fired.

1349
01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.741
‐ They started going
into that room.

1350
01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.077
‐ You go to the door.
you look through the door.

1351
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.547
there's an adult male
basically twitching

1352
01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:28.218
at the bottom of his bed.
laying on the ground. done.

1353
01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:32.322
There are several females
in the room.

1354
01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.823
Again. part of
the Intel brief was. hey.

1355
01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:35.658
these women could wear
suicide vests.

1356
01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:38.761
We'd seen aggressive
females downstairs.

1357
01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.231
So the point man who had
whispered Khalid's name

1358
01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.967
literally rushed into the room.
pushed the two women up against

1359
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.204
the back far wall
in case they had a suicide vest.

1360
01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:51.674
He would have taken the blast
and protected us.

1361
01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:54.544
Like. okay. wow. tha‐‐
that might be him. right?

1362
01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:58.615
His hair was‐‐ I remember
the bridge of his nose.

1363
01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.084
I don't know. we all carried
photos of him. right?

1364
01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.419
The photo I had.
he had a very gray beard.

1365
01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.289
Looking down at him. his beard
was pitch black.

1366
01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.691
When I searched his bathroom.
guess what I found.

1367
01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:10.927
Just for Men hair dye

1368
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.163
literally on his little shelf
above his sink.

1369
01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:19.669
‐ We're listening and a certain
amount of time goes by.

1370
01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:22.005
and then the next call sign
we got was

1371
01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.440
"Geronimo. Geronimo. Geronimo."

1372
01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.309
and that was from
the ground force commander.

1373
01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:29.445
Geronimo had been the call sign
for bin Laden.

1374
01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:30.613
‐ They said it three times.

1375
01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:32.282
All he needed to do
was say it once.

1376
01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:35.585
I could just tell when
he called that he understood

1377
01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.187
what he was about to say was
going to be momentous

1378
01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.890
and heard by a lot of people
inside the US government.

1379
01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:44.661
‐ I had to call back out
and said. is Geronimo EKIA?

1380
01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.162
Of course.
they came back quickly

1381
01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.197
and said EKIA.
enemy killed in action.

1382
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:51.534
Everybody in the command post
just let out a shout.

1383
01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:53.169
and a jump and raised
their fist in the air.

1384
01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:56.339
and then again. in a quarter
of a second. they were back down

1385
01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.007
in their seats and it was
silent and people were just

1386
01:07:58.241 --> 01:07:59.776
doing their jobs.

1387
01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.445
‐ I remember looking at my
co‐pilots like. they got him.

1388
01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:05.048
They called Geronimo.
they got him.

1389
01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.050
‐ In our particular vault.
because there were no

1390
01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:10.253
senior policymakers.
this was a much more

1391
01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:13.389
from the trenches‐‐
immediately celebratory.

1392
01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:17.493
but also a lot of just tears
and overwhelmed people.

1393
01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:20.797
‐ I had the sense.
that everybody

1394
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:24.801
was just taking a moment

1395
01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:28.705
to savor the fact that

1396
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.275
all those people who
had been killed on 9/11

1397
01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.577
had finally been avenged.

1398
01:08:34.811 --> 01:08:37.580
‐ There was...

1399
01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:41.584
some sense of vindication.
although. at that point.

1400
01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.586
these guys are
in a dark building.

1401
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.924
They can't be absolutely certain
that it's bin Laden.

1402
01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:52.061
but there seems to be
some confidence that it is.

1403
01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:55.365
At that point. immediately.
my mind went to. all right.

1404
01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:58.801
get these guys out of here
as fast as possible.

1405
01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:05.842
(narrator)
With one Black Hawk disabled.

1406
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.877
the Chinook helicopters
are no longer flying backup.

1407
01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:10.880
They now must lead
the way home.

1408
01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:12.215
(Aviation Planner)
When we first heard

1409
01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.984
of the aircraft crashing.

1410
01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:19.255
it takes a few seconds for it
to set in that this is reality.

1411
01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:22.659
That was the most
rehearsed contingency

1412
01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.061
that we had planned for.

1413
01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:28.665
So it was no longer
an unscripted plan.

1414
01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:32.101
It was now just the alternate
ending to a story

1415
01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.270
that had already
been scripted out.

1416
01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:37.840
‐ Once I was told to execute.
I mean. my you know. my call.

1417
01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:43.179
And we proceeded ourselves
kind of back to the northwest

1418
01:09:43.413 --> 01:09:45.348
and went up this
very large river valley.

1419
01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:47.550
It was about 30 miles or so
to the northwest.

1420
01:09:47.784 --> 01:09:50.386
(narrator) Though one of their
helicopters has crashed.

1421
01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.889
it takes the SEALs only
about ten minutes

1422
01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:57.060
to secure the compound.
killing four men and one woman.

1423
01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:01.164
Next. they gather as much
intelligence as possible.

1424
01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.166
Even with bin Laden dead.

1425
01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:08.671
the fight against al‐Qaeda
will continue.

1426
01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:11.074
‐ We're on the clock. right?

1427
01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.076
We know helos are
running out of fuel.

1428
01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.410
we've got X amount of time

1429
01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.612
to wrap things up
and get out of there.

1430
01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.348
People running around with bags
just stuffing anything you can.

1431
01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:23.619
Computers. hard drives.
paperwork.

1432
01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:25.555
anything you can find.
you're stuff in bags.

1433
01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.391
‐ I just fell into
the forensic aspect of it.

1434
01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:32.261
Kind of wiped off the face
a little bit.

1435
01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.597
get as much blood off it
so we could get some pictures.

1436
01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.432
you know. get
a really good look at

1437
01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.267
the positive identification
of him.

1438
01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:40.103
‐ At this point. you know.
somebody on the radio

1439
01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.105
had asked for more time.
our master chief was like.

1440
01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.607
nope. you don't have it.
leave right now.

1441
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.243
If we don't leave right now.
we're gonna miss our ride.

1442
01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:49.579
So I remember we come
running out.

1443
01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.915
everybody's carrying bags
and bags of intel.

1444
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:56.352
‐ Black Hawk came back in.
picked up 12 of the SEALs

1445
01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.688
without any extra equipment.
and they departed

1446
01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.190
and headed straight up
to receive fuel

1447
01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.159
before I came in to pick up
the remaining SEALs

1448
01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:05.728
plus all the extra equipment
they found on the compound.

1449
01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:09.799
‐ As we kind of got finished
with our duties

1450
01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.100
and our responsibilities

1451
01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.436
upstairs with
the DNA collection.

1452
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:17.340
we drug the body downstairs.

1453
01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.175
got him in a body bag
in the courtyard.

1454
01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.878
‐ We had planned for
30 minutes time on target.

1455
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.079
Then we'd given ourselves

1456
01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:24.914
an extra ten‐minute window
to spare.

1457
01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:29.619
‐ Because of the commotion.
the gunshots. the helicopter.

1458
01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.888
it's drawing a lot of attention
from the community

1459
01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.791
regardless of the fact that it's
the middle of the night there.

1460
01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:39.328
And so. there's also a lot
of concern due to the proximity

1461
01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:42.498
of the compound to other
military installations there.

1462
01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:45.034
And so we're monitoring those
very. very closely.

1463
01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:50.807
‐ I look. people coming out of
the houses like they were

1464
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.608
running towards us.
all of them.

1465
01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:54.443
That was the time
that I realized

1466
01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:56.112
that I have to do something.

1467
01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:57.647
So then I called them
and I said.

1468
01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.448
this is a government business.

1469
01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:04.086
If you want to stay alive.
don't come.

1470
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.322
Go back to your house.
Please go back to your house.

1471
01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:09.292
I was just talking.
of course. in Pashto.

1472
01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:12.328
There are two guys. they tried
to run towards us.

1473
01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.430
One of the SEALs
who were very close to me

1474
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.699
and he put dots on them.

1475
01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.601
So I tapped on the shoulder.

1476
01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.603
I said. wait. and then
I curse them.

1477
01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.238
And I said. go back.
why you are coming here?

1478
01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:23.573
And they went back.

1479
01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.308
They listened.
That was the greatest thing.

1480
01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.979
‐ You could see a lot of people
moving in the courtyard.

1481
01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:31.814
There were a lot more women
and children on the target

1482
01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:33.683
than we had estimated.

1483
01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:36.018
We have loaded the downed
helicopter with demolition.

1484
01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.153
we were gonna blow it in place.

1485
01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:38.721
Any time we lose
a helicopter.

1486
01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:41.791
we're prepared to destroy the.
uh. the crypto gear on board

1487
01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.893
and the radios and some
of the sensitive technology.

1488
01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.028
‐ The word goes out.
blow the helo.

1489
01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:47.363
They put it on a timer.

1490
01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:49.532
not a remote control detonate.
but a timer.

1491
01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.434
Set the timer. let it click.

1492
01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:54.203
Helos. they'll land
in one minute.

1493
01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:56.739
‐ I was inbound from
the southwest.

1494
01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:59.375
and that's when one of
the soldiers got on the radio

1495
01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:01.277
and told me to break away.

1496
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.579
The helicopter pilot
banks a right.

1497
01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:05.581
Boom.

1498
01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:08.317
‐ Not but 100 yards away
from landing

1499
01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.888
to pick up the ground force.
that aircraft blew up.

1500
01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:16.058
And it was a 150 foot.
200 foot mushroom cloud.

1501
01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:20.930
And so immediate 360 degree
right turn to get up

1502
01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.233
underneath that cloud and debris

1503
01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:27.270
and then come in and land
to pick them up.

1504
01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:28.938
‐ We were so close that
you could feel

1505
01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:31.040
the heat from inside the 47.

1506
01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:33.042
‐ We were within ten seconds

1507
01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:35.711
of blowing our own helicopter
out of the sky.

1508
01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.047
‐ When they blew the helicopter.

1509
01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:40.249
then obviously
all hell broke loose

1510
01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:42.919
and most of the villagers
woke up.

1511
01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:46.022
The Pakistanis realized that
something had happened.

1512
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.924
They weren't quite sure
what had happened.

1513
01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:52.094
but we knew that they had
been put on alert.

1514
01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:55.631
‐ And we were scared to death
the Pakistanis would mobilize

1515
01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:58.467
their Air Force and shoot down
our helicopters.

1516
01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:01.404
which is one reason why we put
all that DNA from bin Laden

1517
01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.539
and the intelligence
in one helicopter

1518
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.841
and his remains
in another helicopter.

1519
01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:07.343
So if one of them got shot down.

1520
01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.745
we still had the evidence
that we've got.

1521
01:14:11.514 --> 01:14:15.785
‐ The valley was now
full of blue lights.

1522
01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.954
police lights
all over the place.

1523
01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.455
And they were coming
closer to the compound.

1524
01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:22.058
It was time to get them
out of there.

1525
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.094
I have a fuel tank.
contingency assaulters.

1526
01:14:25.328 --> 01:14:28.130
primary SEALs.
and I have the air crew

1527
01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:31.000
all crammed into an MH‐47.

1528
01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:34.003
We put that airframe to
its max potential because of

1529
01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.806
the amount of weight and amount
of people had on board.

1530
01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.474
we were just barely
over rooftops.

1531
01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:41.978
Above the Pakistani
military academy.

1532
01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.714
the original plan is that
we were all going to link up

1533
01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:47.850
to refuel and then
return home as a flight.

1534
01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.553
Now that we are in
two separate locations

1535
01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:53.489
at two separate points in time.

1536
01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:56.993
there was no sense in us
trying to focus on

1537
01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.396
consolidating and the return.

1538
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:01.664
(narrator)
The first Chinook takes

1539
01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:04.567
a direct route
back towards Afghanistan.

1540
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.635
The surviving Black Hawk
heads north

1541
01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:10.139
to get fuel from
the second Chinook.

1542
01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:12.708
‐ I remember all the lights
in the helicopter blinking.

1543
01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:14.610
and knowing we were low on fuel.

1544
01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.381
‐ Before the Black Hawk
got there.

1545
01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.117
I don't think we're on the
ground more than 15 minutes.

1546
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.519
he had to transfer most
of his ground force to me

1547
01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:26.355
because he took on the fuel
he needed to get back.

1548
01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:29.658
He absolutely needed the gas
to get back to Afghanistan.

1549
01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:31.293
But because of the weight
that the ground force.

1550
01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.995
he couldn't climb out
of the valley.

1551
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.898
‐ Took us about 19 minutes
on the ground.

1552
01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.801
That was probably the longest
19 months of that mission.

1553
01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.469
(narrator)
Refueling complete.

1554
01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.972
the two helicopters fly back
in tandem

1555
01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.141
with the Chinook in the lead.

1556
01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.843
‐ When we fly as fast as
he can fly. I can leave him.

1557
01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:50.513
so he's following me
and electronic warfare displays

1558
01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.181
are very active at this point.

1559
01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:53.516
And I'm like. okay. well.
we've got stuff out there

1560
01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:54.917
looking for us now.

1561
01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:56.419
‐ They flew fairly
a northern route

1562
01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:59.155
outside the populous area.
the route we took was

1563
01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:02.892
a direct route through
low land. populated areas.

1564
01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.994
If anybody was going to be seen.
it was going to be us.

1565
01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.695
‐ One of the team leaders
comes in across radios says.

1566
01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:09.965
hey. Pakistan scrambled
fighters after us.

1567
01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.668
‐ So we were getting indications
whether it be on the radio

1568
01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:15.638
or on board systems
that radar systems were up

1569
01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:20.242
and we were seen and
we're being tracked.

1570
01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:24.280
And then lo and behold. before
you know it. we had an F‐16 that

1571
01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:28.350
was at a nearby base in Pakistan
that was searching for us.

1572
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:33.055
And three times. the F‐16
was searching for us.

1573
01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:35.458
and then through acquisition.

1574
01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:38.627
and the next step
was target track.

1575
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:40.463
‐ Honestly. at that point.
I started thinking about

1576
01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:43.799
my funeral because
there's no way that this

1577
01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:47.670
ginormous flying bus
was going to out‐speed.

1578
01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.338
outmaneuver a jet

1579
01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:52.374
that we probably sold them
30‐some years ago.

1580
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.310
‐ We just watched
the clock and the maps.

1581
01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:58.013
just praying that they would get
out of Pakistan airspace in time

1582
01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:00.683
before some type
of clash ensued.

1583
01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.518
(narrator)
The returning helicopters

1584
01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.687
face one last hurdle.

1585
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.857
Operation Neptune Spear
has been kept secret

1586
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.493
from American commanders
in Afghanistan.

1587
01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:14.063
That night. some US forces
noticed the approach

1588
01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:17.266
of unknown aircraft
from Pakistan.

1589
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.468
‐ There was an operation
near the border.

1590
01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:21.337
which we did all the time.

1591
01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.572
Part of that element picked up

1592
01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.574
our guys coming across
that border.

1593
01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.611
‐ They were actually escalating
just one step shy of them

1594
01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:31.147
releasing weapons
to shoot us down.

1595
01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.815
We were trying
everything we could.

1596
01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.150
They finally just had to
break radio silence

1597
01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.218
and tell them to stand down.

1598
01:17:38.521 --> 01:17:40.489
‐ I never thought I'd enjoy
hearing those words.

1599
01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:43.726
"Welcome to Afghanistan."
but that was music to my ears.

1600
01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:54.470
(narrator)
Four hours after setting out.

1601
01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.839
all of the operators
and air crews

1602
01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:59.141
who carried out
Operation Neptune Spear

1603
01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:01.277
are back in Afghanistan.

1604
01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:05.948
The first order of business
is confirming whose remains

1605
01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:08.517
they have brought back
with them.

1606
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.319
‐ We had touched down in Jabat.

1607
01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:12.688
got off the helos.
there was guys there

1608
01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:15.624
to grab the body. pulled them
right into a hangar.

1609
01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:19.094
I remember McRaven showing up
immediately after.

1610
01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:20.930
He's like. all right.
let me see him.

1611
01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:22.431
‐ I unzip the body bag.

1612
01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.600
and I pulled the remains
out of the body bag.

1613
01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.570
And of course. we knew that
bin Laden was about 6'4.

1614
01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.405
I saw a young SEAL
standing by and I said.

1615
01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.207
hey. son. how tall are you?

1616
01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.408
And he looked at me
kind of funny. he said.

1617
01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.076
"Well. sir. I'm 6'2."

1618
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.244
Yeah. come here for a minute.

1619
01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.713
I want you to lie down
right here.

1620
01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.682
And he said.
"I'm sorry. sir. what?"

1621
01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:41.884
I said. I want you to lie down
next to the remains.

1622
01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.552
So he lay down next the remains.

1623
01:18:43.786 --> 01:18:45.387
And sure enough. the remains
were a couple of inches.

1624
01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:48.057
They put bin Laden's
body back in.

1625
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.893
and I went five months back‐‐

1626
01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:54.363
back to my video teleconference
with the president.

1627
01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:57.132
And the president asked.
"Well. Bill. is it him?"

1628
01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:59.268
I said. well. sir.
you know. without DNA.

1629
01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:03.906
I can't tell you 100%.
but certainly looks like him.

1630
01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:06.275
You know. all the features
are the same.

1631
01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:08.777
I said I even had somebody
lie down next to him

1632
01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:11.447
and the remains were
a little bit longer.

1633
01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.284
And there's a pause on
the other end of the screen.

1634
01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:18.787
And of course. by this time.
the boys are back safely.

1635
01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.723
The tension of the moment
is down.

1636
01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:25.027
And the president says. "Okay
Bill. let me get this straight."

1637
01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.696
"We had $60 million
for a helicopter.

1638
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:31.634
but you didn't have $10
for a tape measure?"

1639
01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:34.970
(narrator)
Back in The Situation Room.

1640
01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:36.805
President Obama awaits

1641
01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:40.242
DNA confirmation of
the identity of the remains.

1642
01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:43.078
But will the news leak before
the president is ready

1643
01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:46.582
to announce
Osama bin Laden's death?

1644
01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:50.352
‐ First reaction was
we're gonna hold

1645
01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:53.022
We will not announce tonight.

1646
01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:56.825
I'm not going in front of
300 million Americans

1647
01:19:57.059 --> 01:20:00.696
with a one in 20 chance
of being completely wrong.

1648
01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:02.164
This is too important.

1649
01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:04.466
People were saying this story
is not going to hold.

1650
01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:08.070
If you wait till morning.
it will come out somewhere else.

1651
01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:11.607
And the downside of that is
bigger than this one.

1652
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.176
And so he started to weigh.

1653
01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.712
do I go with this.
do I go with that?

1654
01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.615
They were passing around
photos at the table.

1655
01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:23.585
But when he looked
at the photo.

1656
01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.822
I thought I saw a change
in his demeanor

1657
01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:29.992
that he‐‐ I think he felt
when he saw it himself

1658
01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:32.328
and he saw the similarities.

1659
01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.863
that the 95% became higher.

1660
01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:37.966
He said we'll go at 10:30
or something like that.

1661
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.768
So the speechwriters
get cranking.

1662
01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:42.071
everybody gets cranking and
then we're all waiting

1663
01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.473
for the president's speech.

1664
01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.347
‐ Good evening.

1665
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.249
Tonight. I can report
to the American people

1666
01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:56.752
and to the world
that the United States

1667
01:20:56.985 --> 01:21:00.255
has conducted an operation
that killed Osama bin Laden.

1668
01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:01.724
the leader of al‐Qaeda.

1669
01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:04.893
and a terrorist who's
responsible for the murder

1670
01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:10.599
of thousands of innocent men.
women and children.

1671
01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.368
It was nearly ten years ago

1672
01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:15.471
that a bright September day was
darkened by the worst attack

1673
01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.973
on the American people
in our history.

1674
01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:22.044
The images of 9/11 are seared
into our national memory.

1675
01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:26.315
‐ So we had left the White House
and we were walking down

1676
01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:30.252
the open portico.
and we heard this noise

1677
01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:34.223
before we went outside and
none of us knew what it was.

1678
01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:38.694
(all chanting)
USA. USA. USA. USA!

1679
01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:43.198
USA! USA! USA! USA!

1680
01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:47.669
‐ "USA. USA. CIA. CIA."

1681
01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:52.341
I never thought I would ever
hear a crowd yelling "CIA"

1682
01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:57.513
and I think everyone
at the CIA

1683
01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.350
just felt a tremendous
amount of pride

1684
01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:05.421
that we had been able
to work on the operation

1685
01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.990
and do it successfully.

1686
01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.558
(Clinton)
And it was thrilling.

1687
01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:14.062
And it was just the kind
of response one would hope for.

1688
01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:17.699
particularly from young
Americans who might not have

1689
01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.936
been born or were toddlers
at the time of 9/11.

1690
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:23.705
(chanting indistinctly)

1691
01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.508
(Clapper) It was closure for
the country. for the families.

1692
01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:29.311
certainly closure for the
intelligence community.

1693
01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:31.180
I also think it had
a profound impact

1694
01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:33.682
on al‐Qaeda as a movement.

1695
01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:40.856
just the symbolism of this
almost semi‐mythical figure.

1696
01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:44.359
Osama bin Laden.

1697
01:22:44.593 --> 01:22:48.764
and his demise.
hugely important message.

1698
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.269
‐ It was important for us
to get bin Laden.

1699
01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:59.274
but not because we thought it
would dramatically change

1700
01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:01.643
the nature of the war
at the time.

1701
01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:06.415
I think what was important was
this was about justice.

1702
01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.651
It wasn't revenge.
it was about justice.

1703
01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:16.959
‐ We had discussed this before
the raid ever took place.

1704
01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:21.463
if we got him and he got his
remains. what do we do with him?

1705
01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:24.299
We don't wanna...

1706
01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:28.170
have him some place that
will become a shrine

1707
01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:33.909
for terrorists. there's an
obligation to offer the remains

1708
01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.812
to his family back
in Saudi Arabia.

1709
01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:39.314
And my recollection.
I'm a little vague on this.

1710
01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:41.483
but my recollection is

1711
01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:43.719
they didn't want anything
to do with it.

1712
01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:48.824
And so the decision was made
that his remains would be taken

1713
01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:51.193
to a ship and buried at sea.

1714
01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:55.230
‐ One of the clear discoveries
from all of the information that

1715
01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:58.967
was gathered at the compound was
that bin Laden was still very

1716
01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:05.440
active and trying to continue
the planning effort on future

1717
01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:09.111
attacks in this country.
that he continued to try

1718
01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:12.881
to exert leadership
over al‐Qaeda.

1719
01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:17.352
‐ I think that
the bin Laden operation

1720
01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:22.024
is a good example of

1721
01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:26.595
government at its best. not just
a military action at its best.

1722
01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:30.198
You've got all these different
agencies who set egos aside.

1723
01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:33.068
You have people who are
staying focused on mission.

1724
01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:37.806
a reminder that we're able
to work together

1725
01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.475
for the common good
when we put our minds to it.

1726
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:44.546
And it's something we should try
more often.

1727
01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:51.920
‐ We jumped on a plane.
19 hours later.

1728
01:24:52.154 --> 01:24:54.056
you land back in the States.

1729
01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.858
I can remember turning on
my phone for the first time

1730
01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.261
and I probably had
a hundred text messages

1731
01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:02.130
from family and friends and
everybody who'd seen the news.

1732
01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:05.467
And literally the next morning
was trash day.

1733
01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:07.269
and I'm taking my trash out

1734
01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.504
and my neighbor lady
across the street.

1735
01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:10.973
she knew I was a SEAL.

1736
01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:12.774
she didn't know what I did
or what I was involved in.

1737
01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:14.343
but she had put
two and two together

1738
01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.011
that I was out of town
and now I'm back.

1739
01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.513
And I don't know if she knew
I was involved or not.

1740
01:25:18.747 --> 01:25:20.882
I'm taking my trash out.
I see her come out of her house.

1741
01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.719
no trash cans.
but she's crying.

1742
01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.220
She walks all the way
down her driveway.

1743
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.189
walks across the street.
gives him a bear hug.

1744
01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:28.657
looks at me in the eyes
and says. "You never know

1745
01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.726
what your neighbors do
for a living. do you?"
