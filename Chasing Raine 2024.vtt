{\an8}<i>Command.
this is Echo Six Fox.</i>

4
00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.565
{\an8}<i>requesting permission to engage.</i>

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:49.360
{\an8}<i>Stand down. you know
the mission. Echo Six Fox.</i>

6
00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:52.404
{\an8}<i>Stay on mission. you do not
have permission to engage.</i>

{\an8}<i>Command.
you're coming in unreadable.</i>

8
00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:57.451
{\an8}<i>Do not engage.
that's the order.</i>

9
00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:02.873
{\an8}<i>This is a recon mission only.
Echo Six Fox.</i>

10
00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:16.554
{\an8}<i>You just disobeyed
a fucking direct order.</i>

11
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.389
{\an8}<i>Return to the extraction point.</i>

12
00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:58.072
Six. seven. eight.

13
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.158
nine. ten.

14
00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:05.579
11. 12. 13.

15
00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:08.040
14. 15.

16
00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.170
Raine!

17
00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:15.089
Raine!

18
00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.466
I'm gonna find you!

19
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.260
Raine!

20
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:23.263
Raine!

21
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.140
Come on. Raine.
you can't hide forever!

22
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:28.644
Raine?

23
00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.605
Raine.

24
00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:33.399
Where are you?

25
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.528
Raine.

26
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.366
I'm not playing anymore. Raine.
You need to come out.

27
00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.617
Got you!

28
00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:44.994
No. I got you!

29
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.286
Shouldn't you be hiding?

30
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.330
Let's just say
we both got each other.

31
00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.040
Let's just start over.

32
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.001
Raine. no. We have to get going.

33
00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.669
Your parents
are expecting us soon.

34
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.587
And what are you doing
with a tree branch?

35
00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:57.798
Let's go.

36
00:04:58.007 --> 00:04:59.717
You're always up to no good.

37
00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:03.220
And another thing I noticed.
I take this game very seriously.

38
00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:04.680
and you're cheating
in this game.

39
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.140
- No.
- Yes. you are.

40
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.850
And I'm gonna tell your mother

41
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.059
because you know
better than that.

42
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:10.185
Fine.

43
00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:32.499
<i>Mr. Foxx.
after careful consideration</i>

44
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.294
<i>and review
of the continuous police reports</i>

45
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.379
<i>and videos
of your public episodes.</i>

46
00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:40.507
<i>not to mention
your dishonorable discharge.</i>

47
00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:43.093
<i>I'm going to deny
your request for joint custody.</i>

48
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:46.096
<i>granting full custody
to Miss Sky Atlas.</i>

49
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:48.223
<i>You can schedule a hearing</i>

50
00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.641
<i>no earlier
than 12 months from today</i>

51
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.893
<i>for reconsideration.</i>

52
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.312
<i>What you can do in the meantime.</i>

53
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.023
<i>I suggest you get
a serious hold on the drinking</i>

54
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.192
<i>and make sure you finish up
your community service</i>

55
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.110
<i>per your probation orders.</i>

56
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.071
<i>All the best to you both.</i>

57
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:04.698
<i>Court is dismissed.</i>

58
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.368
Thank you
for keeping her occupied.

59
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.412
No problem. I enjoy
spending time with Raine.

60
00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.042
- Hi. sweetheart.
- Hi. Mommy.

61
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.044
- You need to use the restroom?
- No. Mommy.

62
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.379
I think you should get out and
stretch your legs a little bit.

63
00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:20.839
- Okay.
- Okay?

64
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.801
Raine. if you listen
to your mother.

65
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.177
we can go get ice cream.

66
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.929
Can I get a new fidget instead?

67
00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.180
That's fair.

68
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:33.018
Ah. come here.

69
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.192
You want to know what's funny?

70
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.488
When I was at war.

71
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:28.949
I never thought
about what was next.

72
00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.036
What I was gonna do
when it was over.

73
00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:41.003
But I guess.
uh. this is it.

74
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.382
Uh. I guess this...

75
00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:48.385
is the hardest part.

76
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.180
The normal.

77
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.270
I mean. we were warriors. right?

78
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.194
Now. when the war ends.
this shit.

79
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.782
How-- how do you...

80
00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.702
how do you live like that?

81
00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:15.370
Hmm?

82
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:23.212
But I guess
that's why we're here.

83
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.633
Trying to figure it out.
Working on it.

84
00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.471
I respect that.

85
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.722
Here's the thing.

86
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.642
If you're gonna
look at yourself.

87
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.560
I mean. really take a look
at yourself in the mirror.

88
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.564
You gotta be honest
with everyone else.

89
00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:45.567
But first. you gotta be
honest with yourself.

90
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.327
This is the first time.
for as long as I can remember...

91
00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.288
I don't have a war to fight.

92
00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.961
And I'm scared shitless.

93
00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.634
The Marine Corp taught me
how to survive in combat.

94
00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.679
How to take a man's life.

95
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.431
All for my country.

96
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.776
But they didn't teach me
how to keep that bitch

97
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:28.902
from taking my daughter.

98
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:30.153
You made her. right?

99
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:35.826
Take her back.

100
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:37.953
Like the soldier you are.

101
00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:46.086
I ain't no fucking soldier.

102
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.969
Hurrah. Marine.

103
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.764
Hurrah.

104
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.898
I updated your files

105
00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.568
and you can sign beside it.

106
00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:12.446
Appreciate it.

107
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.991
I got about 23 hours left
and then this is over.

108
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.995
I get to spend more time
with my daughter.

109
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.248
Hmm.

110
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.167
I see the look on your face.
you're serious about this.

111
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.672
Tomorrow is another day.

112
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.883
Roll with the punches.

113
00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:34.676
You'll get her back.

114
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.721
This is just
another trial by fire.

115
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.016
Don't forget. you're a warrior.

116
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:44.019
And let that lay
on the content of your mind.

117
00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:56.865
How far would you go.

118
00:10:57.074 --> 00:10:58.784
if somebody
took your son from you?

119
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.661
What would you do
to get him back?

120
00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:06.500
For my son...

121
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.754
I'd do anything
under God's sky...

122
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.173
to get him back.

123
00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:18.303
Remember who you are

124
00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.805
and what you are.

125
00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:30.982
Thank you.

126
00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:33.276
Good luck.

127
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.903
- I'll see you next week.
- All right.

128
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.725
<i>Hey. Daddy.</i>

129
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.688
<i>Dad. look what I found.</i>

130
00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.149
<i>Look. Daddy.</i>

131
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.027
<i>Oh. wow.</i>

132
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.657
<i>How did you learn to do that?</i>

133
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:22.909
<i>I just did it.</i>

134
00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.661
<i>You're such a smart kid.</i>

135
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.251
<i>You didn't say
Simon says. Daddy.</i>

136
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.335
<i>See.
that's why you're so smart.</i>

137
00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:33.462
<i>You are so smart.</i>

138
00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.672
<i>God. you're smart.</i>

139
00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:37.174
<i>And beautiful
just like your mom.</i>

140
00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.593
<i>All right.
Wanna go play on the swings.</i>

141
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:40.886
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

142
00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.137
<i>Let's go play on the swings.</i>

143
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.351
<i>I push you a little bit here?</i>

144
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.604
<i>I'm a big girl. Dad.</i>

145
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.564
<i>Ah.
last time you let me push you.</i>

146
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.441
<i>But I don't need you
to push me. Daddy.</i>

147
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:55.859
<i>Oh.</i>

148
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.700
<i>Is Niko my new daddy?</i>

149
00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.750
<i>Daddy. I haven't seen you
in a long time.</i>

150
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.752
<i>Where have you been?</i>

151
00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.297
<i>Daddy. I really wanna see you.</i>

152
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.841
<i>I love you. Daddy.</i>

153
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.136
<i>Daddy. you're my hero.</i>

154
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.598
<i>Seven-year-old Chris William</i>

155
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.934
<i>and three-year-old
Tristan Howard</i>

156
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.186
<i>were abducted today from school.</i>

157
00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.188
{\an8}<i>Authorities say
that they were scheduled</i>

158
00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.398
{\an8}<i>to be car ride</i>

159
00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.776
{\an8}<i>and are believed to have been
lured into the wrong vehicle.</i>

160
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.779
{\an8}<i>They were both last seen
wearing their school uniforms.</i>

161
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.490
{\an8}<i>This is the fifth abduction
in the last three months.</i>

162
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.742
<i>Now. this story
is still developing.</i>

163
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:48.370
<i>Authorities say
that they have several leads.</i>

164
00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.748
<i>They're currently reviewing
security footage from the school</i>

165
00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:54.417
<i>and are analyzing
the vehicle that was used</i>

166
00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.378
<i>during the children's
abduction.</i>

167
00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.130
{\an8}<i>Authorities say
if you have any information</i>

168
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.174
{\an8}<i>about the whereabouts
of these children.</i>

169
00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.635
{\an8}<i>call 9-1-1 immediately.</i>

170
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.501
Go. Mom. Go. go. go.

171
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.679
- Done.
- No way.

172
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.980
I knew mom was gonna win.

173
00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.065
No one can beat her
at Wild Wild West.

174
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.235
- Done.
- Great job.

175
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.322
I'll cheer for you
in the next round. Niko.

176
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.573
Thanks. Raine.

177
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.950
Wait. we're-- we can't
switch teams like that.

178
00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:11.536
- We're supposed to be partners.
- Sorry. Mom.

179
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.125
Babe.

180
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.628
I just want you to relax.

181
00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:25.216
You tired?

182
00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:28.511
It's too risky. Niko.

183
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.766
It's too soon.

184
00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.811
Raine just got adjusted
with all that's happened.

185
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.190
I understand
your concern. but...

186
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.734
with this offer.

187
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.277
we're only talking
about three years.

188
00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.196
I know.

189
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.823
And they're willing
to pay for relocation fees.

190
00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.493
And with the bonus.

191
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:52.827
we'll finally be able
to pay off the car.

192
00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.621
True.

193
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.706
But don't get me wrong.
I am happy about your job offer.

194
00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.750
Okay.

195
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.377
And definitely
we can use the money.

196
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.253
Plus.
I've already done a research

197
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.713
on schools in the area.

198
00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.007
and compared
to where Raine goes now.

199
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:07.258
they're much better.

200
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.094
See. that's the thing.

201
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.262
That's the whole reason
why I got out of the military.

202
00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.847
I didn't want to be
that mom that takes her kid

203
00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.933
from house to house.
school to school.

204
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.977
Kids thrive in stability.

205
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.188
I agree.

206
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.693
And given
the current economic situation.

207
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.486
I think
there's way more opportunity

208
00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:29.656
for long-term stability
in Utah right now.

209
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.451
I just don't want to take
Raine away from her dad.

210
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.664
Look. I truly think that
he's getting himself together.

211
00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:45.839
<i>Seven-year-old Chris William</i>

212
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.299
<i>and three-year-old
Tristan Howard</i>

213
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.427
<i>were abducted today from school.</i>

214
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.303
<i>Authorities say
that they were scheduled--</i>

215
00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.559
See?

216
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.770
The change
might not be such a bad thing.

217
00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:03.565
And--

218
00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.859
I hear you with Clyde.
I really do.

219
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.697
But he's had three years
to get his shit together.

220
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.908
and it's not your job
to babysit him anymore.

221
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.163
Look.

222
00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.333
We're not gonna
keep her from him. I promise.

223
00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.963
And to put in the work
to get clearance from the judge.

224
00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:33.094
If we relocate.

225
00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.596
this is the last time.

226
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.814
I couldn't agree more.

227
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.123
- Morning.
- Good morning.

228
00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.143
It's probably Joi.

229
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.603
Can you let her in
on your way out. babe?

230
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:24.771
Of course.

231
00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:43.665
- Hi. good morning.
- Morning. Joi.

232
00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:46.751
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

233
00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.787
Jab.

234
00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:25.957
Good job.

235
00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:32.839
Good job.

236
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.800
Up here.

237
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:38.219
One. two. three.

238
00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.054
Again.

239
00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:42.891
Three.

240
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:45.810
Again.

241
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.104
Good job.

242
00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:51.858
All right. Again.

243
00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.277
Double jab.

244
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.113
To the left.

245
00:19:58.656 --> 00:19:59.741
Good job.

246
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.659
One. two.

247
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:04.412
Jab.

248
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.164
What's going on?

249
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:07.832
We're good.

250
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:10.168
- One. two. three.
- I need to talk to you.

251
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.045
- Nice.
- Sky. what's up?

252
00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.632
I might be relocating to Utah.

253
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:22.388
Utah?

254
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.267
- Are we working or what?
- Take these off.

255
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.770
We just fucking started
to take your gloves off?

256
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:30.188
Well. now we're done.

257
00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.651
Go.

258
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.027
What's really going on?

259
00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.198
Don't tell me.

260
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.241
You caught
that husband cheating.

261
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.661
I told you about him.

262
00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:48.498
Doesn't that sound
like someone else I know?

263
00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.126
May have had a few women
leave me here and there.

264
00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.379
- Oh. just a few?
- Just a few.

265
00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.632
No. he didn't cheat. Caesar.

266
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.676
He got a really good job offer.

267
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.928
And we really
could use the money.

268
00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:03.304
Hmm.

269
00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.014
So it's a money thing. huh?

270
00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.267
Well. I know you know
I can fix any issue you have.

271
00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.061
especially a money one.

272
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:13.272
I am not running guns for you

273
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.233
to convicts and drug dealers.

274
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:17.485
Sky. what's the price?

275
00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:20.738
- The price of what?
- The price for you to stay.

276
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.784
A quarter mil.

277
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.621
- What you got for me?
- I got a trunk full.

278
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.790
Sitting out there
in that driveway.

279
00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.834
I'm serious. man.

280
00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:34.460
Your husband can make
his bonus in two days.

281
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.587
You can stay.
continue to train me.

282
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:40.049
and I can keep all my bitches
on track and feeling safe.

283
00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.178
That doesn't even sound right.

284
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.890
And plus. I--

285
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.934
I got a little girl
I gotta think about.

286
00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:54.105
Yeah. that's even
more of a reason.

287
00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.190
I guess we'll see.

288
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.234
I guess so.

289
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.299
What's up?

290
00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.801
I still think it would be easier

291
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.803
if you focused on
how you squeeze the trigger.

292
00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.597
What am I doing?

293
00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.140
See.
when you release your wrist.

294
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:30.349
it flinches a bit.

295
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:31.934
- Up and down?
- Yeah.

296
00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:33.895
So don't let
the recoil intimidate you.

297
00:22:34.812 --> 00:22:36.230
I'm not intimidated
by the recoil.

298
00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:37.523
All right. let's go.

299
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.027
- Hi.
- Hi. Mommy.

300
00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:26.072
Oh.

301
00:23:34.664 --> 00:23:36.707
Joi. do you think
you could give me an hour or so?

302
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:39.627
I have a few phone calls
that need my attention.

303
00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:41.504
No problem.

304
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.506
I guess this is the best time
to finish our puzzle.

305
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:45.299
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

306
00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.235
- <i>Good afternoon.</i>
- Good afternoon.

307
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:07.155
Could you please direct me
to the right department

308
00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:09.907
to inquire about the process
of transferring schools?

309
00:24:10.116 --> 00:24:11.200
<i>One moment. ma'am.</i>

310
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.578
<i>Let me place you
on a brief hold.</i>

311
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:14.996
Thank you so much.

312
00:24:20.418 --> 00:24:21.711
<i>Are you still here. ma'am?</i>

313
00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:23.671
Yes. I'm here.

314
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.174
<i>Social security card.
Proof of residency.</i>

315
00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:28.426
Huh. I figured.

316
00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:31.053
<i>And their immunization records.</i>

317
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:32.930
Thank you so much.

318
00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.724
<i>Have a great day.</i>

319
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:53.242
What's your pulse looking like?

320
00:24:54.368 --> 00:24:56.537
140. You?

321
00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:00.082
It was 98 until I saw you.

322
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:03.127
Now. it's skyrocketing.

323
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.171
You know. that's funny.

324
00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:06.839
Why is that?

325
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:09.508
- Sky.
- Clyde.

326
00:25:09.717 --> 00:25:10.801
Nice to meet you.

327
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.803
I've been seeing you
around here lately.

328
00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.181
Yeah. you know the Corps
needs me in top shape.

329
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:16.724
- Who you with?
- Navy.

330
00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:18.017
Oorah.

331
00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:20.728
Oh. okay. marine guy.

332
00:25:20.937 --> 00:25:22.230
I see you. I see you.

333
00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:24.148
- Proud to serve.
- I know that's right.

334
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:26.484
Oh?

335
00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:28.486
What do you usually do
after your workouts?

336
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.280
Uh. I don't know.

337
00:25:31.489 --> 00:25:33.199
I usually. you know. go grab
a bite to eat at Blanks.

338
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:35.201
Well. I'd love
to join you. Ms. Sky.

339
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:39.288
Well. I'd love for you
to join me. Mr. Clyde.

340
00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.642
I guess.
you're about to call your mom.

341
00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:24.917
Is everything okay?

342
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.503
Everything's fine.

343
00:26:28.296 --> 00:26:30.089
I need you to do me a favor
and look in

344
00:26:30.298 --> 00:26:31.924
for some documents for me.

345
00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:33.551
Yeah. what kind of documents
and what would it be?

346
00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:35.177
A personal security card.

347
00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:37.346
They'll be at the bottom
of the bookshelf.

348
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.307
In like a little black bag.

349
00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:41.309
I know what bag
you're talking about.

350
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.106
While you're on the phone.

351
00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:49.483
while you're there.
I wanted to let you know

352
00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:53.154
it's a possibility that
we could be relocating.

353
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:54.739
But nothing is set in stone.

354
00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:57.783
What the fuck you mean
you're relocating?

355
00:26:57.992 --> 00:26:59.744
<i>Hold on. wait. wait. wait.</i>

356
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:01.454
<i>You call me to look
for my daughter's documents</i>

357
00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:03.664

my little girl away from me?

358
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.542
All right. look.
I said nothing is set in stone.

359
00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:09.754
Vile ass bitch.

360
00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.242
I thought Raine was gonna
log back in. but she didn't.

361
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:07.997
You're so beautiful.

362
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.128
Niko. where's your ring?

363
00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:22.887

Fine.

365
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:54.460
This is so good.

366
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:57.046
I can't wait to finish.

367
00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:02.051
Hello?

368
00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:04.970
I need you to send
those files over immediately.

369
00:30:05.763 --> 00:30:08.015
Because I have to take care
of this little effing brat.

370
00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:13.062
The babysitting
pays for my music.

371
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.480
It's a must.

372
00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:19.360

I'll be waiting for my files.

I should be back around seven.

380

Okay.

393

Damn. who y'all

394
00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:25.486
Come on. girl. you know we don't
half-ass anything around here.

395
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:26.987
- I see.

396
00:32:27.905 --> 00:32:29.031
Oh. shit.

397
00:32:29.698 --> 00:32:32.451
- You got the 43X.
- What did I tell you?

398
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:35.579
She can shoot them all. but...

399
00:32:36.372 --> 00:32:38.165
she's had her eye
on this one for a while.

400
00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:43.796
Oh. yeah.
I'm gonna get y'all right.

401
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.048
Yeah. you need to.

402
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:48.384
Somebody got to show these guys
how to shoot these things.

403
00:32:50.219 --> 00:32:51.261
Indeed.

404
00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.238

406
00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:14.785
Dad...

407
00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:17.746
when are you going to come by
and see me?

408
00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:19.248
I miss you.

409
00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:22.209
I haven't seen you in forever.

410
00:33:26.714 --> 00:33:29.341
Have you seen my phone?
I can't find it anywhere.

411
00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.386
Yeah. I was calling my mom.

412
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.431
Please ask me
before using my phone.

413
00:33:35.639 --> 00:33:37.516
You can't just go and take
people's things like that.

414
00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:39.768
I know your mom
taught you better.

415
00:33:43.397 --> 00:33:46.024
This isn't your mom's number.
Why are you lying to me?

416
00:33:46.692 --> 00:33:48.944
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

417
00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:52.531
Don't be sorry. Do better.

418
00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:54.658
Sorry doesn't make you better.

419
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:04.084
Whenever you're ready. let's go
downstairs and watch a movie.

420
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:07.546
<i>What. you did not
recognize my pretty face?</i>

421
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.301
<i>Are you going to kill me?</i>

422
00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:13.552
<i>Well...</i>

423
00:34:15.637 --> 00:34:17.014
<i>that all depends.</i>

424
00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.682
<i>On what?</i>

425
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.060
<i>If you can do
what we ask of you.</i>

426
00:34:26.648 --> 00:34:28.108
<i>A little brave of you. stealing.</i>

427
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.235
<i>Looks like we've got fucking...</i>

428
00:34:30.444 --> 00:34:31.945
Go ahead and have the rest.
I'll make some more.

429
00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:34.114
Are you sure?

430
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.250
Were your parents
expecting company

431
00:34:45.459 --> 00:34:46.627
this evening for our son?

432
00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:56.553
Raine!

433
00:34:56.762 --> 00:34:58.514
Daddy!

434
00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:21.411
Hey. hey. princess.

435
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.038
Listen. Mommy asked me
to bring you something.

436
00:35:23.247 --> 00:35:24.832
Can you open
the door for Daddy. please?

437
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.250
Maybe you should wait
until Sky gets here.

438
00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:28.627
She didn't tell me that
anybody was coming this evening.

439
00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:30.003
- Please open the door.
- Come on. let's go.

440
00:35:30.212 --> 00:35:31.171

444
00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:38.095
Joi. you need to let me in.

445
00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:39.888
Please open the door. please?

446
00:35:40.097 --> 00:35:41.640

It's okay. You're fine. okay?

453
00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:02.911
Why can't I see my daddy?

454

You can.

455
00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:06.415
He just has to run it
by your mom first.

456
00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:10.127
Listen. why don't you
go ahead and dry these tears.

457
00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.670
Uh. go ahead
and clean your hands.

458
00:36:11.879 --> 00:36:13.213
And by the time
that you're done.

459
00:36:13.422 --> 00:36:15.132
I'll have
fresh popcorn ready. okay?

460
00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:18.343
Can you call my mommy
to tell her my daddy's here?

461
00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:20.721

- Daddy!
- Hey. baby.

467
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.181
Where's Joi?

468
00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:49.267
Ah. Joi had to go.

469
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.062
But now we get
to spend more time together.

470
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.855
- How's that sound?
- Great.

471
00:37:54.064 --> 00:37:55.899
Daddy. can I show you something?

472

00:37:58.151 --> 00:37:59.695
But first.

474
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:01.697
- We're going on an adventure.
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:04.157
Then you can tell me whatever
you want to tell me in the car.

476
00:38:04.366 --> 00:38:05.409
Okay.

477
00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:40.152
Mommy never lets me
sit in the front seat.

478
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.737
Well. Mommy's not here.

479
00:38:42.237 --> 00:38:43.572
You're with Daddy now.

Has your dad fed you?

515

No. I had some chips.

516
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:49.758

- Good.

531
00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:49.109
Seatbelt.

532
00:42:55.365 --> 00:42:56.408
Forget something?

533
00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.372
You're doing a really great job.

534
00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:04.541
Like I'm supposed
to know about that.

535
00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:07.210
- Mm-hmm.
- That's your job to tell me.

536
00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:09.587
All right. see you later. bro.

537
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.035
Sky. you ain't
gonna eat nothing?

538
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:43.788
I can't reach
my daughter or her sitter.

539
00:43:44.581 --> 00:43:45.999
I need to go
by my house real quick.

540
00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:47.917
All right.

541
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:49.169
Let me know
if you need anything.

542
00:43:49.169 --> 00:43:50.086
All right. I'll be back.

543
00:43:54.758 --> 00:43:56.384
Hey. baby.
I made up a song about you.

544
00:43:56.593 --> 00:43:57.552
Come check it out.

545
00:43:58.261 --> 00:43:59.804
<i>♪ Oh. Doris ♪</i>

546
00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:02.599
<i>♪ You're looking
so lovely tonight ♪</i>

547
00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:05.685
<i>♪ You got a smile
that shines so bright ♪</i>

548
00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:06.978
<i>♪ Oh. Doris ♪</i>

549
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.815
Could you make me
your chicken pot pie. baby?

550
00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:14.402
Please.

551
00:44:14.611 --> 00:44:15.987
How about...

552
00:44:16.196 --> 00:44:17.405
Yeah?

553
00:44:18.198 --> 00:44:20.158
You fix my [indistinct].

554
00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:22.327
Ooh. come on. Really?

555
00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:24.996
- Mm-hmm.
- That old piece of crap. baby?

556
00:44:25.205 --> 00:44:26.581
You had that ever since
you was a kid?

557
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.541
Mm-hmm. It's sentimental.

558
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:31.294
Mmm.

559
00:44:31.503 --> 00:44:33.254
You know I can't say no to that.

560
00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:36.591
You bet I will. baby.

561
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.098
- Love you. baby.
- Love you more.

562
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.735
Raine!

563
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:00.490
Raine!

564
00:45:01.408 --> 00:45:02.450
Raine!

565
00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:32.313
No.

566
00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:45.452
He took her. He took her.

567
00:45:46.286 --> 00:45:48.913
And she's not here.
I came home [indistinct] Raine.

568
00:45:50.123 --> 00:45:51.124
I didn't see her.

569
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:53.293
I saw blood on the walls.

570
00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:54.711
I didn't see Joi.
I didn't see nothing.

571
00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:57.797
They're not here.
They're not here.

572
00:45:58.006 --> 00:45:59.048
He took my baby.

573
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:03.011
Okay.

574
00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:07.390
Try. Hurry up.

575
00:46:08.057 --> 00:46:09.142
I'll see you when you get here.

576
00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:54.687
Damn it.

577
00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:57.065
Honey. this thing's
a piece of shit.

578
00:46:58.566 --> 00:47:00.026
What do you want to keep it for?

579
00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:05.073
That's something she had when
she was just a little girl.

580
00:47:42.944 --> 00:47:45.113
Hey. honey.
we got any more beer left?

581
00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:53.538
Hey. baby. did I tell you today
that I loved you?

582
00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:56.958
Did I tell you today
that you were beautiful?

583
00:47:57.166 --> 00:47:59.127
Well. you are.

584
00:48:00.044 --> 00:48:01.838
You're the most
beautiful thing in the world.

585
00:48:03.298 --> 00:48:05.216
That's why I'm fixing
this thing for you. you know.

586
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.177
Because I think
you're beautiful and I love you.

587
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.431
I still think
you should get rid of it.

588
00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:19.897
Baby. I-- I'm gonna need
another tool here.

589
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:21.149
This ain't working.

590
00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:45.256
Honey. you didn't
fall asleep on me. did you?

591
00:49:42.814 --> 00:49:44.565
Baby. this tool
ain't gonna do it.

592
00:49:44.774 --> 00:49:47.068
I gotta go downstairs
to get my screw gun.

593
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.743
I need to fix the door. too.

594
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:19.350
- Howard!
- What?

595
00:50:19.934 --> 00:50:21.394
Finish it tomorrow.

596
00:50:22.562 --> 00:50:23.855
I can't find my screw gun.

597
00:50:24.063 --> 00:50:25.648
so I'm trying
to use this damn hammer.

598
00:50:25.857 --> 00:50:27.567
You know. it's--
it's in the basement somewhere.

599
00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:30.486
- But--
- All right!

600
00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:32.488
- I'm trying to sleep.
- All right.

601
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:05.730
Wait. it's hard to understand
what you're saying.

602
00:51:06.314 --> 00:51:07.356
Slow down.

603
00:51:10.151 --> 00:51:11.778
Yeah. of course.
whatever you need.

604
00:51:14.197 --> 00:51:15.239
Yeah. I'm on my way.

605
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:19.994
Shit!

606
00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:31.881
Give me the rundown. Cap.

607
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.966
you gotta have
some contingency plan

608
00:51:34.175 --> 00:51:35.468
for something like this.

609
00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:38.346
Listen. man.
I'm going solo on this one.

610
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:40.848
- Sky needs me.
- Well. let me get the men.

611
00:51:41.057 --> 00:51:43.643
What I need you to do
is take the men.

612
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:45.770
and finish this deal.
you understand?

613
00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:47.313
- I got you.
- Thank you.

614
00:51:48.773 --> 00:51:50.900
Guys. I'm out.
I'll send you my location.

615
00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:52.193
Be ready.

616
00:52:30.815 --> 00:52:32.149
Hi.

617
00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:34.527
Um. do I know you?

618
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.571
My name is Sarah Cohen.

619
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:40.616
I'm looking for my daughter.
Her tracking device led me here.

620
00:52:40.825 --> 00:52:42.201
Do you mind if I look around?

621
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:48.124
Look. sweetheart. I--
I hope you find your daughter.

622
00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:52.128
I really do. but she's--
she's not here. okay?

623
00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:54.005
You have a good day. okay?

624
00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:03.556
Back up. I said back up.

625
00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:14.901
Is anyone else here?

626
00:53:16.277 --> 00:53:17.570
Get down on the floor.

627
00:53:18.446 --> 00:53:20.656
Hurry up!
Put your hands behind your back.

628
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.713
Relax. I just want
to take a look around.

629
00:53:44.472 --> 00:53:45.598
Where's your phone?

630
00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:50.770
- Where is your goddamn phone?
- On the couch.

631
00:53:52.063 --> 00:53:53.856
It's on the couch.

632
00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:39.652
- What the f--
- Put your hands down. Jody.

633
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.153
Put them down.

634
00:54:41.362 --> 00:54:42.405
Drive.

635
00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:46.325
Where's Raine?

636
00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:48.452
I said drive.

637
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.288
My wife and I

638
00:54:51.497 --> 00:54:53.165
are just looking
for our daughter.

639
00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:55.209
Your daughter?

640
00:54:56.544 --> 00:54:58.295
I can assure you
with all certainty

641
00:54:58.504 --> 00:55:00.256
if you refer to my daughter
as your daughter again.

642
00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:02.800
then I will kill you.
do you understand me?

643
00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:05.261
Yes. Yes.

644
00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:06.846
- Yes.
- Now stop crying.

645
00:55:07.346 --> 00:55:08.514
Pull your shit together.

646
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.644
And drive.

647
00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:15.438
Calm down.

648
00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:34.206
So. how's my wife?

649
00:55:55.978 --> 00:55:57.354
Hey. baby!

650
00:56:01.984 --> 00:56:03.652
Holy shit!

651
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:06.614
Howard. look out!

652
00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:07.782
Howard. look out!

653
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:09.492
What the fuck?

654
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.702
Hands behind your back.

655
00:56:15.247 --> 00:56:16.540
Look. just shut up.

656
00:56:18.918 --> 00:56:21.045
We don't have
any cash in this house.

657
00:56:21.629 --> 00:56:23.422
- Do you want to die today?
- No.

658
00:56:23.631 --> 00:56:24.924
Then be still.

659
00:56:25.132 --> 00:56:26.634
Why are you doing this?

660
00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:30.763
Baby. you all right?

661
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:32.014
Just shut up.

662
00:56:32.932 --> 00:56:34.683
What's going on?

663
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.853
Just shut up.
I want to take a look around.

664
00:56:38.062 --> 00:56:39.105
Just shut up.

665
00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:43.192
Raine?

666
00:56:44.068 --> 00:56:45.569
Baby. where are you?

667
00:56:46.779 --> 00:56:48.489
Raine. I'm here. just come out.

668
00:56:58.874 --> 00:57:00.417
Lying bitch.
Is anybody else here?

669
00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:03.587
No! No! No one else is here.

670
00:57:38.914 --> 00:57:40.207
Raine!

671
00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:44.378
Raine. baby. are you in here?

672
00:57:45.504 --> 00:57:47.381
Baby. come out. I'm here.

673
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:49.925
Raine. baby.
Mommy is here. come here. baby.

674
00:58:04.899 --> 00:58:06.609
No.

675
00:58:07.776 --> 00:58:10.529
Where's my baby? Oh. my gosh.

676
00:58:10.738 --> 00:58:11.864
Okay.

677
00:58:14.074 --> 00:58:14.992
Raine?

678
00:58:31.717 --> 00:58:34.178
What's going on?
Do you know this person?

679
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:37.723
Lady. listen. we don't got shit.

680
00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:40.476
I can barely pay the bills.

681
00:58:40.684 --> 00:58:41.936
What the hell?

682
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:47.650
What the fuck?

683
00:58:47.858 --> 00:58:48.984
Shit!

684
00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:51.487
Doris.

685
00:58:53.239 --> 00:58:55.491
Doris. baby. you-- Ow!

686
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.494
Hey. honey. you okay. baby?

687
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.123
Look. I found
my daughter's device

688
00:59:03.332 --> 00:59:04.625
downstairs.

689
00:59:06.085 --> 00:59:07.127
Where is she?

690
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.425
Lady. I swear to God.

691
00:59:13.634 --> 00:59:15.427
we don't know
what you're talking about.

692
00:59:15.636 --> 00:59:18.305
- There are no children here.
- Where is she?

693
00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:20.808
I swear. please.

694
00:59:21.016 --> 00:59:22.351
Look. you're lying.

695
00:59:23.394 --> 00:59:26.397
I found my daughter's
device downstairs.

696
00:59:27.022 --> 00:59:30.859
So unless your wife
is a goddamn handyman.

697
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:32.194
where is she?

698
00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:37.992
{\an8}Lady. I swear. there are
no children here.

699
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:40.911
{\an8}We've been here all day long.

700
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.999
{\an8}We don't know
who your daughter is.

701
00:59:45.207 --> 00:59:46.250
Look.

702
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.545
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

703
00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:52.464
Where is my daughter?

704
00:59:52.673 --> 00:59:54.883
And why is her device here?

705
00:59:57.428 --> 01:00:00.306
Okay. fine.
You don't want to tell me?

706
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.558
- You say bye-bye to your wife.
- Lady. please.

707
01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.601
Please. lady. please. dear God.

708
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.895
- Where's my daughter?
- Lady. please!

709
01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.523
Ssh!

710
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.569
You don't want
to tell me the truth?

711
01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:21.952
Okay. since you
don't care about your wife...

712
01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.872
I wonder if you
care about your life.

713
01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.007
Lady. I swear.

714
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.009
we've been here all day.

715
01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.844
We don't know
who your daughter is.

716
01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:40.679
There are no children here.

717
01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.097
Fine. all right.

718
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.646
- What the fuck?
- We don't know anything.

719
01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:52.733
Please don't hurt us.

720
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.903
What the fuck?

721
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:58.447
What are you doing. lady?

722
01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.573
Please.
Please don't hurt us.

723
01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:01.325
We don't know anything.

724
01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.535
We don't know
who your daughter is.

725
01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:07.206
{\an8}I swear. lady. we've been
here all day.

726
01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:09.375
{\an8}We don't know
who your daughter is.

727
01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:13.045
{\an8}There are no children here.
Look. check my phone.

728
01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:14.797
{\an8}Check my phone!

729
01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.882
{\an8}It's in my right pocket
down here.

730
01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:19.426
{\an8}There's an app on it
called Eagle Eye.

731
01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:22.304
The code is 090987.

732
01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:23.889
- What pocket?
- It's right there.

733
01:01:24.098 --> 01:01:25.891
my right front.
lady. please check it out.

734
01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.601
Just check it out.

735
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:29.895
It records
everything around the house.

736
01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:31.271
What's the code?

737
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.317
090987.

738
01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:37.194
It's all there.

739
01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:39.279
It's motion detected.
if there would have been

740
01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:41.990
anybody else in the house.
it would have recorded it.

741
01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.993
Please. lady. please. lady.

742
01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.872
{\an8}Baby. You okay. baby?

743
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:50.290
{\an8}Baby. you okay?

744
01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:56.839
{\an8}Yes. baby. easy.

745
01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.017
{\an8}I love you. baby.

746
01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:13.355
{\an8}Damn. [indistinct].

747
01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:19.236
{\an8}Please let us go.

748
01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:20.487
{\an8}Where is this footage
stored?

749
01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:25.075
{\an8}- Just-- It's only on my phone!
- How do I delete it?

750
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:28.454
{\an8}Just hit the delete button
and it's all gone.

751
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:29.705
{\an8}Please.

752
01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:33.250
{\an8}Just leave.

753
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:37.421
Please. just leave.

754
01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:56.231
Look. I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to find my baby.

755
01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.443
Please. just leave.

756
01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.368
Where's he at?

757
01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:25.844
Get out the car!
Get out the car!

758
01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:11.848
Fuck.

759
01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:20.232
Oh. goddammit.

760
01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:29.741
He set me up.

761
01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:43.005
He took my car.
Clyde. he set me up.

762
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.423
<i>You need to be calm.</i>

763
01:04:54.016 --> 01:04:55.892
Can I Face Time my mommy?

764
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:59.313
You just couldn't wait to get
your hands on the phone. huh?

765
01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:03.233
But yes.
you can Face Time your mom.

766
01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:07.195
I'm sure she would be happy
to hear about your day today.

767
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.368
I thought
I had her number locked in.

768
01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.620
Let me call your dad.

769
01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:35.098
Your mom
is still at work. sweetie.

770
01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:37.976
But she will
give you a call soon. okay?

771
01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:39.478
- Okay.
- Okay.

772
01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:47.444
Did you want me
to cut up your waffles?

773
01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:50.155
- No. I have it.
- Okay.

774
01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:53.033
You know what?
I have to go to the restroom.

775
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.077
And you can figure out
how you're gonna beat me

776
01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.329
at tic-tac-toe while eating
your chicken and waffles.

777
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.918
Don't move from here. okay?

778
01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.378
{\an8}- Okay.
- Okay.

779
01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.034
Where's the girl?

780
01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:41.039
- What?
- Clyde kidnapped Raine.

781
01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:43.291
And don't tell me
you don't know shit about it.

782
01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:45.544
Don't play with me.

783
01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:47.963
Clyde kidnapped
Raine earlier today.

784
01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.965
And don't act like you
don't know nothing about it.

785
01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.426
Where's your phone at?

786
01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:54.886
- Take it out.
- Okay.

787
01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:56.972
Call him.

788
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:00.892
Dial the number.

789
01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:29.504
What the fuck?
What the fuck. Clyde?

790
01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:37.012
- What the fuck. Clyde?
- Oh. shit. Jody.

791
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.138
We can
work something out.

792
01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:39.389
Don't beg.

793
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.522
It's too late for that.

794
01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:52.527
So she chose you

795
01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:53.695
over me.

796
01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:55.405
Okay.

797
01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:58.074
Sky married me.

798
01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:01.453
It's not your choice or mine.

799
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:02.704
It's hers.

800
01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:06.458
And you made the choices.
The wrong ones.

801
01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.418
That drove her to me.

802
01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.213
You're just

803
01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:13.590
too small-minded to see that.

804
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.510
And unfortunately.

805
01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:20.305
your choices happen
to involve me as well now.

806
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:25.060
What could you possibly think
you know about choices. huh?

807
01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:34.361
Listen. I gotta take this.

808
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.113
Open up. Open.

809
01:08:37.906 --> 01:08:39.032
Bite down.

810
01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:45.121
<i>Yes. sis. what's up?</i>

811
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.499
Clyde. did you kidnap Raine?

812
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.585
<i>Because if you did.
you manipulated me.</i>

813
01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.712
<i>and you put me
in a really bad spot.</i>

814
01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:55.590
And you made me
an accessory to your shit.

815
01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:58.426
That was a real. real cunt move.

816
01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.387
<i>Listen.
she's my daughter too. okay?</i>

817
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:01.930
I helped make her.

818
01:09:03.181 --> 01:09:04.683
I got
all this shit under control.

819
01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.686
I'm sorry. You were saying?

820
01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:09.563
Choices.

821
01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.817
I love Sky.

822
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:15.944
And I chose

823
01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.030
to accept Raine into my life.

824
01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.993
Might be time
you accept me as well.

825
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:25.412
- Like they did.
- That shit will never happen.

826
01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.790
Then what's the plan. Clyde?
To ride off in the sunset?

827
01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:30.792
Live happily ever after?

828
01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.503
Living life on the run?

829
01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.798
Lying to Raine
for the rest of her life?

830
01:09:37.007 --> 01:09:40.093
- Easy.
- Not a great plan.

831
01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:43.805
You're a drunk.
You were a shit husband.

832
01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.807
And an even shittier father.

833
01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:50.145
They deserve a shield
to protect them. not this.

834
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:55.150
You grew into a weak man.
A disgrace to your uniform.

835
01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.237
Get your legs up here.

836
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:01.823
Shut up.

837
01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.994
You shut up!

838
01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:14.252
You're not-- You're not moving.

839
01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:18.840
Or you'll never get to see
your father or mother again.

840
01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.563
Don't you move.

841
01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.196
Raine! Raine!

842
01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:45.158
Damn. I know
I told her to stay right here.

843
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.793
Excuse me.
Have you seen my niece?

844
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:59.005
Um. she's like. four foot tall.
Black hair. African American.

845
01:10:59.214 --> 01:11:02.509
Um. she's wearing
a blue top and purple pants.

846
01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:03.885
She looks like this.

847
01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:06.596
No.

848
01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.017
I know somebody
had to see something.

849
01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:14.604
Excuse me. ma'am.

850
01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:18.984
You said
blue shirt and purple jeans?

851
01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.152
Yes. that's what
she was wearing.

852
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.822
She left with some Asian guy
not too long ago.

853
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.573
She did what?

854
01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:28.451
Would you like me to check
the surveillance camera?

855
01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.329
Yes. um. can I go with you
to see the footage. please?

856
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:35.000
I actually have access
to the footage on my phone.

857
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.251
Give me a moment.

858
01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:42.090
Shit. Can you call the police?

859
01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:45.468
Did she look uncomfortable
or anything like that?

860
01:11:45.677 --> 01:11:47.345
She was crying.

861
01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:48.805
And that didn't
raise a red flag for you?

862
01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.557
You left her alone.

863
01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.686
I don't involve myself
with customers like that.

864
01:11:55.687 --> 01:11:58.398
Look. I can give you
access to this footage.

865
01:11:58.398 --> 01:12:00.108
- But that's all I can do.
- Hey. I just sent you

866
01:12:00.108 --> 01:12:02.444
last known location.
I'm on my way.

867
01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:11.327
Raine has
my other phone in her bag.

868
01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.204
We should track her from there.

869
01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:16.499
Come with me until we find her.

870
01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.013
You're nothing but a shadow.

871
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:32.766
And now. Sky is my wife.

872
01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:35.477
And as far as I'm concerned.

873
01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.353
Raine is my daughter.

874
01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:57.457
Say. honey bunny.
You doing okay back there?

875
01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:01.544
Yeah. you're doing okay.

876
01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.714
All right. I got it.

877
01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:08.635
<i>♪ You are the sunshine ♪</i>

878
01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:10.887
<i>♪ Of my life ♪</i>

879
01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:15.517
<i>♪ And we are going to the bank
♪</i>

880
01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:24.651
So. I'm gonna do
anything to you.

881
01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.112
You can be rest assured

882
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.406
because you are my bank.

883
01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.286
My precious flower.

884
01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.331
I know she's here.

885
01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.166
This is where
my tracker led me to.

886
01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:04.959
Right here.

887
01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:07.503
Let's strap up.

888
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.808
<i>Hey. Sky.
so far there's a guard</i>

889
01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:04.060
<i>about 036 clicks
out in front of you.</i>

890
01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:06.020
<i>Where is he located?</i>

891
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.064
<i>Near the north
entrance of the building.</i>

892
01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.774
<i>Okay. is it just that
one or is there another one?</i>

893
01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.192
<i>No. it's just the one.</i>

894
01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:34.507
How many guards are inside?

895
01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.218
Fuck you. lady.
I ain't telling you shit.

896
01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:39.262
Fuck me? Fuck you!

897
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.764
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

898
01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:46.894
Too many to count.
And they're heavily armed.

899
01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:48.813
You're crazy
if you're gonna think

900
01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.106
you can get out of here
by yourself.

901
01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:50.982
Don't you worry about me.

902
01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:57.822
Have you seen this little girl?

903
01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.408
Yeah. I've seen her.

904
01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.038
It's about time.

905
01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.749
Ladies and gentlemen.

906
01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:53.086
the moment
you all have been waiting for.

907
01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:58.800
I hope you see something
you like this evening.

908
01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.678
Shall we get started?

909
01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:04.347
Oh. shit.

910
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.808
Sky. you got company.

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:09.352
Drone just picked up
Clyde entering the building.

912
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.063
I'm on my way.

913
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.261
Hey. what's up. y'all?

Baby. I'm so glad I found you.

Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

940
01:25:47.518 --> 01:25:51.313
No. Daddy.
I was-- I was [indistinct].

941
01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:55.609
Listen. we are gonna go
on an adventure. okay?

942

You are gonna be...

943

Daddy's little superhero.

944
01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:04.910
Can you do that?
And this is gonna be your cape.

945

All right. here you go.

946

You. keep the guests at bay.

Guns. come on!

That was your last shot. Clyde.

Send the girl out to me.

Once I go in there.

Yeah. I do.
What's my job?

- To protect me.
- Damn right.

966
01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:14.409
Listen. Daddy has to go in there
and protect you right now.

967
01:30:15.035 --> 01:30:16.328
But I promise
I'll be right back.

968
01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:20.124
- Please don't leave me. Daddy.

- You believe me?
- Yes. Daddy.

971
01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:26.588
All right.

Hey!

976

I'm not done.

977
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:07.958
Come here!

978
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.768
I promised you an adventure.

979
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.104
Yes. Daddy.

980
01:34:13.106 --> 01:34:14.358
Well. it's not the end of it.

981
01:34:18.195 --> 01:34:19.571
It's definitely not the end.

982
01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:22.574
Oh. would you look...

983
01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:26.244

984
01:34:30.624 --> 01:34:31.666
Wait.

985
01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:33.502
No way!

986
01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:37.047
There's no way...

987
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:40.342
I could be that lucky.

988
01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:44.012
Oh!

989
01:34:51.478 --> 01:34:52.521
Ladies first.

990
01:35:03.657 --> 01:35:06.118
I'm so glad you didn't see
your father get beat up.

991
01:38:15.223 --> 01:38:18.435
<i>In a brazen story
that has just been reported.</i>

992
01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:22.272
<i>a family brings down an enormous
child-trafficking ring</i>

<i>in a heroic act to save
their kidnapped daughter.</i>
