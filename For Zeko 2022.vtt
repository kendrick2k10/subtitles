"Shall we start?"

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:21.474
"If there was a palm
tree in your yard"

5
00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:24.034
"and its roots grew long and it turns
out it's going to bother you someday"

"Or would you cut it
after it grows the dates?"

"I'm sorry. I'm just
getting into character"

18
00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:53.314
"Getting into character? How many
followers do you have on this program?"

21
00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:56.874
- Do you think this is okay?
- What can I do. Son?

22
00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.634
I've been dreaming of becoming
an artist and an actor for 40 years

23
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.754
Are you trying to fulfill your
dream now. Uncle Fawzi?

24
00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:04.514
Is it too late for me?

25
00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:06.034
Very much so

26
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:06.514
Very much so

27
00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:08.874
Your performance is very bad. too

28
00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:10.394
Okay. thank you for saying that

29
00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:12.034
Stop playing backgammon

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:12.794
Stop playing backgammon
you've brought us poverty

31
00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:15.034
Is backgammon what's
bringing us poverty. Mr. Fathi?

32
00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:16.634
So what if it really
brought it to us?

33
00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:18.034
We're not better off than
those around us. Hamouda

34
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:18.794

You know. I learned
something from this job

You know. I learned
something from this job

39
00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:25.754
That life is too short

40
00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:28.034
No. that kerosene-powered
cars are disgusting

41
00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.034
What is wrong with kerosene cars?

42
00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:30.394
What is wrong with kerosene cars?

43
00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:32.354
Can you find one like them nowadays?

44
00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:34.354
Yes. we can find it at
the museum. Mr. Sameer

45
00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:36.034
What if I tell you that
this car that you don't like

46
00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:37.434
What if I tell you that
this car that you don't like

47
00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.754
transported people who
are better than you and me

48
00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.034
but they never complained
or said anything?

49
00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:42.234
but they never complained
or said anything?

50
00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.194
- Because they're dead
- But they're polite

51
00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.514
- Yes
- Just so you know

52
00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:48.034
You will need this
car sooner or later

53
00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:48.194
You will need this
car sooner or later

54
00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:50.914
I hope I don't need
it or you. Mr. Sameer

55
00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.514

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:56.514
Listen. Hamouda

59
00:01:56.914 --> 00:01:58.834
Give him a hundred
pounds to refuel the car

60
00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.034
- A hundred pounds?
- Isn't it enough?

61
00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:00.874
- A hundred pounds?
- Isn't it enough?

62
00:02:00.994 --> 00:02:02.074
I'll use Fawzi's car

63
00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:04.194

Hang in there. he's going to meet
someone who's better than you and me

73
00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:42.034
Get away from him!

74
00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:42.514
Get away from him!

75
00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:45.354
- It's none of your business!
- You must respect the dead!

76
00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:00.034
"Make way! Make way!"

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:37.034
"Ask the plumber to do your makeup!"

84
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:38.314
What's going on?

85
00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:40.034
Some women fighting

86
00:04:40.474 --> 00:04:41.514
That's fun

87
00:04:41.674 --> 00:04:42.034
Women's fights are fun

88
00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:42.834
Women's fights are fun

89
00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.394
Have they reached the hair
pulling and clothes tearing stage?

90
00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:48.034
Not yet. but go there fast. as your
wife Safaa is the one who's fighting

You bastard!

93

You're letting your brother's
wife fight and just watching!

94
00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:53.274
They fight every day. Fathi!

95
00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:54.034
- Let's go separate them

96
00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:56.234
- Let's go separate them

- Okay

100
00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:03.074
and I say it to you specifically

101
00:05:03.274 --> 00:05:06.034
I'll step on the neck of anyone
who hits my son Zakaria again

102
00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:06.314
I'll step on the neck of anyone
who hits my son Zakaria again

103
00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.114
Don't say words bigger than you. Safaa

104
00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:12.034
Besides. all the neighborhood boys hit
your son. will you only punish my son?

105
00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:12.834
Besides. all the neighborhood boys hit
your son. will you only punish my son?

106
00:05:12.954 --> 00:05:15.314
No. I won't. I'll make him stand
in the middle of the neighborhood

107
00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:17.194
and get hit by all passers-by

108
00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:19.994
What are you doing. you idiot?

109
00:05:20.114 --> 00:05:21.274
What are you doing?

110
00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:23.954
Like mother like son. dear!

111
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.074
What's the matter. Safaa?

112
00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:27.474
- What is the matter?
- This woman's son hit Zakaria

113
00:05:27.634 --> 00:05:29.154
and she doesn't like getting scolded

114
00:05:29.874 --> 00:05:30.034
- Did he hit you. Zeko?
- He did. Daddy

115
00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:32.234
- Did he hit you. Zeko?
- He did. Daddy

116
00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:36.034

These things happen between
kids. it's okay. let's go. Safaa

118
00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:39.514
"It's okay"? Is that the
best you can do. Fathi?

119
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.514
What did you want him to do to me?

120
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:42.034
Did you bring him knowing that I'm a
lonely lady with no man to fend for me?

121
00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:46.314
Did you bring him knowing that I'm a
lonely lady with no man to fend for me?

122
00:05:46.434 --> 00:05:47.794
What are you saying?

123
00:05:48.234 --> 00:05:50.354
Do you think I'm going
to fight with you. Om Ali?

124
00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:51.754
How sweet!

125
00:05:51.874 --> 00:05:53.274
- Why don't you hug her?
- Safaa!

126
00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:54.034
- Shall I bring you a light dinner?
- Be respectful and shut up. Safaa!

127
00:05:54.034 --> 00:05:55.874
- Shall I bring you a light dinner?

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:27.954
Wow!

Go in front of me. you idiot!

144
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.794
How could you make a scene
in the neighborhood. Safaa?

145
00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:36.034
Did I say something wrong? Standing
in front of her in your undershirt?

146
00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:36.754
Did I say something wrong? Standing
in front of her in your undershirt?

147
00:06:36.874 --> 00:06:38.714
Everyone stands in the
balcony in their undershirt!

148
00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:40.794
Besides. we don't have
anything else. Safaa

149
00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.034
Why are you yelling?

150
00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:42.474
Why are you yelling?

151
00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.634
Nothing. Dad. a few kids fought while
playing together in the neighborhood

152
00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:48.034
Would Safaa let it go in peace?
No. she has to commit a crime first

153
00:06:48.034 --> 00:06:49.514
Would Safaa let it go in peace?
No. she has to commit a crime first

154
00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:51.194
Kids. you in the undershirt?

155
00:06:52.114 --> 00:06:53.234
I see

156
00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:54.034
It's not about the kids then

157
00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:55.634
It's not about the kids then

158
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.874
You're just taking out
on the woman. Safaa

159
00:06:58.034 --> 00:06:59.794
Tell me. what is it?

160
00:06:59.954 --> 00:07:00.034
It's your son. Uncle

161
00:07:00.034 --> 00:07:01.034
It's your son. Uncle

162
00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:02.434
Your son is just like you

163
00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:04.674
He wears his undershirt and
parades in front of women

164
00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:06.034
So what? He's a good son
who takes after his dad

165
00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:07.914
So what? He's a good son
who takes after his dad

166
00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:10.754
Stand however you want
Son. may she be yours

167
00:07:10.874 --> 00:07:12.034
What would I expect from a man
who betrayed the woman who loved him

168
00:07:12.034 --> 00:07:13.114
What would I expect from a man
who betrayed the woman who loved him

169
00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:14.314
and remarried three others?

170
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.914
- What woman?
- She's talking about mom. Dad

171
00:07:17.034 --> 00:07:18.034
Didn't you take your medicine today?

172
00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:18.714
Didn't you take your medicine today?

173
00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:20.914
Looks like you didn't. why didn't
dad take his medicine. Safaa?

174
00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:23.674
- I gave it to him myself this morning
- Why is he out of it then?

175
00:07:23.794 --> 00:07:24.034
He's been like this
ever since I've met him

176
00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:25.474
He's been like this
ever since I've met him

177
00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:27.434
- What is this smell?
- It's food burning

178
00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:28.834
Oh my God!

179
00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:33.154
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- What is the matter?

180
00:07:33.274 --> 00:07:35.274
See your dad's actions?
See what he's doing to us?

181
00:07:35.394 --> 00:07:36.034
Pardon him. Safaa. he's an old man
with Alzheimer's. he's very forgetful

182
00:07:36.034 --> 00:07:37.834
Pardon him. Safaa. he's an old man
with Alzheimer's. he's very forgetful

183
00:07:37.954 --> 00:07:40.074
- Show me your beautiful hands
- What are you saying?

184
00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:41.994
Why are the madam's dishes open?

185
00:07:42.114 --> 00:07:44.794
A cat must've gotten in
here while you were out

186
00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:46.074
A cat?

187
00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:47.714
Did the cat open the dishes

188
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:48.034
put the okra on top of the
rice. and eat it with a spoon?

189
00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.954
put the okra on top of the
rice. and eat it with a spoon?

190
00:07:50.074 --> 00:07:51.634
It's possible. Safaa

191
00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:54.034
What did I do to you to
hurt my business like this?

192
00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:54.074
What did I do to you to
hurt my business like this?

193
00:07:54.194 --> 00:07:56.874
That's unfair! I took care of
you after your wives left you!

194
00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:59.194
- Stop it. stop it. Safaa!
- Why did you do this to me?

195
00:07:59.314 --> 00:08:00.034
Calm down. we'll
figure it out. Safaa!

196
00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:01.434
Calm down. we'll
figure it out. Safaa!

197
00:08:01.594 --> 00:08:03.474
The madam has a banquet
What should I do now?

198
00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.874
Tell her your husband
had a car accident

199
00:08:05.994 --> 00:08:06.034
And how will I return
the money to her?

200
00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:07.594
And how will I return
the money to her?

201
00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.634
- I have 75 pounds
- 75 what?

202
00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:12.034
- What? Calm down. calm down
- 75 what?

203
00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:12.354
- What? Calm down. calm down
- 75 what?

204
00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:14.634
- 75 what? What have you done!
- Calm down. he's my dad. Safaa

205
00:08:14.754 --> 00:08:16.674
- He's my dad. Safaa. calm down
- Get up. you idiot!

206
00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:18.034
- Get up. you idiot! Get up!
- What are you doing?

207
00:08:18.034 --> 00:08:18.754
- Get up. you idiot! Get up!
- What are you doing?

208
00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:20.394
- Get up. you idiot!
- Take it easy!

209
00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:22.834
- Get up! Go in front of me!
- Watch out!

210
00:08:31.514 --> 00:08:32.914
How could you do this. Dad?

211
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.034
She's a liar. I didn't eat anything

212
00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:37.114
She's a liar. I didn't eat anything

213
00:08:37.714 --> 00:08:40.194
I didn't eat anything today

214
00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:43.474
Shall I bring you food?

215
00:08:44.194 --> 00:08:45.674
No. I just ate

216
00:08:47.634 --> 00:08:48.034
Isn't your mother back yet?

217
00:08:48.034 --> 00:08:49.314
Isn't your mother back yet?

218
00:08:49.794 --> 00:08:51.034
No. mom isn't back. Dad

219
00:08:51.154 --> 00:08:53.754
since she died nine years
ago and will never come back

220
00:08:53.874 --> 00:08:54.034
We're the ones who will go to her

221
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.634
We're the ones who will go to her

222
00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:58.354
It's God's will

223
00:08:58.714 --> 00:09:00.034
Take me to Dalal then

224
00:09:00.034 --> 00:09:00.314
Take me to Dalal then

225
00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:03.354
No. don't do it
Dalal is such a grouch

226
00:09:04.274 --> 00:09:05.714
Take me to Inaam

227
00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:07.634
They've all left you. Dad

228
00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:11.234
- All of them?
- All of them abandoned you. Richard

229
00:09:17.714 --> 00:09:18.034
Don't complain!

230
00:09:18.034 --> 00:09:18.994
Don't complain!

231
00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:24.034
- Get out. Zakaria
- I want to play on the street

232
00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:25.034
- Get out. Zakaria
- I want to play on the street

233
00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:27.474
You won't go out to the street
go and sit with your grandpa

234
00:09:30.754 --> 00:09:31.954
I appreciate that
you've endured so much

235
00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:33.714
and are enduring more
than you can handle

236
00:09:33.954 --> 00:09:36.034
- But still...
- When are we getting a divorce. Fathi?

237
00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:36.354
- But still...
- When are we getting a divorce. Fathi?

238
00:09:37.314 --> 00:09:38.434
I'm tired

239
00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:40.394
I'm sick and tired of everything

240
00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:42.034
You're tired?

241
00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:42.394
You're tired?

242
00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:45.914
Are you tired of me. Safaa?

243
00:09:46.074 --> 00:09:48.034
No. Fathi. you are precious to me

244
00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:48.194
No. Fathi. you are precious to me

245
00:09:48.474 --> 00:09:50.154
But I'm tired of your
dad and his actions

246
00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:51.954
and of Issam and his daily disasters

247
00:09:52.474 --> 00:09:54.034
The house is too crowded
I can't take it anymore

248
00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:54.394
The house is too crowded
I can't take it anymore

249
00:09:55.274 --> 00:09:58.154
What do you want me to do. Safaa?
Should I throw them in the street?

250
00:09:58.274 --> 00:10:00.034
I'd cut my tongue out
and I wouldn't say that

251
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:00.394
I'd cut my tongue out
and I wouldn't say that

252
00:10:00.514 --> 00:10:03.114
But I do everything I can for
everyone. and no one appreciates me

253
00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:05.434
I appreciate you. Safaa

254
00:10:06.154 --> 00:10:08.514
I know I'm not the
best man in the world

255
00:10:08.834 --> 00:10:11.314
But I'm doing the best I can

256
00:10:12.394 --> 00:10:13.634
That's just the most I can do

257
00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:15.594
Safaa

258
00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:18.034
I have no one but
you in this world. Safaa

259
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:18.314
I have no one but
you in this world. Safaa

260
00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:21.234
and I love no one else in this
whole world as much as I love you

261
00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:25.354
Me too. Fathi

262
00:10:26.194 --> 00:10:28.034
But this life has become unbearable

263
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:32.514
It'll get better and everything
will be okay in the future

264
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.354
The future is the only
thing that scares me

265
00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:38.194
I'm scared you'd
turn out like your dad

266
00:10:38.434 --> 00:10:40.194
and abandon me like
he abandoned your mom

267
00:10:41.194 --> 00:10:42.034
What's this. Safaa?
You're judging me now?

268
00:10:42.034 --> 00:10:44.114
What's this. Safaa?
You're judging me now?

269
00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:45.514
Of course not. Fathi!

270
00:10:46.874 --> 00:10:48.034
But if you're going to abandon
me. do it now while I'm young

271
00:10:48.034 --> 00:10:49.594
But if you're going to abandon
me. do it now while I'm young

272
00:10:49.714 --> 00:10:52.274
But if you do it when I'm old
who will take care of me then?

273
00:10:52.994 --> 00:10:54.034
Your mind is messing with you. Safaa
more and more as the days go by!

274
00:10:54.034 --> 00:10:55.834
Your mind is messing with you. Safaa
more and more as the days go by!

275
00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:59.074
If that's the case. answer me
when are we getting a divorce?

276
00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:10.154
Okay

277
00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:14.314
Let's go to the registrar
tomorrow and get divorced. Safaa

278
00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:18.034
Wait

279
00:11:18.034 --> 00:11:18.754
Wait

280
00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:21.314
I'll make you some food

281
00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.514
No. I'm full

282
00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:36.034
Get ready. Ajwa. I'm
getting close to the target

283
00:11:36.034 --> 00:11:36.634
Get ready. Ajwa. I'm
getting close to the target

284
00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:41.154
Do you need something. my friend?

285
00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:44.314
Do you need something?

286
00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:45.514
What have you got. my friend?

287
00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:47.794
I have everything. whatever you want

288
00:11:48.034 --> 00:11:50.154
I need it all. go. Ajwa!

289
00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:52.594
Go. Ajwa! Come on!

290
00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:54.034
I swear I will get you!

291
00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:54.674
I swear I will get you!

292
00:11:54.794 --> 00:11:56.754
I will get you! I will get you!

293
00:11:56.874 --> 00:11:58.394
Well done! Well done. boss!

294
00:11:58.514 --> 00:12:00.034
What are you talking about?
It only has cough medicine in it

295
00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:01.354
What are you talking about?
It only has cough medicine in it

296
00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:03.274
How will we be able
to record the song then?

297
00:12:03.394 --> 00:12:06.034
We'll drink the whole medicine
bottle and record the song

298
00:12:06.034 --> 00:12:06.234
We'll drink the whole medicine
bottle and record the song

299
00:12:09.034 --> 00:12:11.234
"Drunk Abdo"

300
00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:12.034
"woke up with regrets"

301
00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:13.434
"woke up with regrets"

302
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.714
"because he feels sick"

303
00:12:16.154 --> 00:12:18.034
"He gets slapped again
and again under the tree"

304
00:12:18.034 --> 00:12:21.434
"He gets slapped again
and again under the tree"

305
00:12:29.034 --> 00:12:30.034
"A powerful kick from Ahmad Naser. a
high and far kick. he aims. but misses

306
00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:32.954
"A powerful kick from Ahmad Naser. a
high and far kick. he aims. but misses

307
00:12:33.394 --> 00:12:35.234
Good evening!

308
00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:36.034
Sit down. Issam. I want to talk to you

309
00:12:36.034 --> 00:12:37.194
Sit down. Issam. I want to talk to you

310
00:12:39.394 --> 00:12:40.634
What do you want. Dad?

311
00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:42.034
Where are Mushir Hanafi. Hadi
Khashabah and Ahmed Hanafi?

312
00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:43.634
Where are Mushir Hanafi. Hadi
Khashabah and Ahmed Hanafi?

313
00:12:43.794 --> 00:12:45.914
Did they upset Saleh Selim?

314
00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:48.034
Why are Al-Ahly plays
with Its juniors?

315
00:12:48.034 --> 00:12:48.274
Why are Al-Ahly plays
with Its juniors?

316
00:12:49.114 --> 00:12:51.674
- What do you mean juniors. Dad?
- Like toddlers

317
00:12:51.794 --> 00:12:53.434
What about them. Dad?
Did they bother you?

318
00:12:53.594 --> 00:12:54.034
No. they didn't bother me

319
00:12:54.034 --> 00:12:54.714
No. they didn't bother me

320
00:12:54.834 --> 00:12:56.674
Tell me if they did
and I'll scold them. Dad!

321
00:12:56.794 --> 00:12:57.954
Are you drunk. man?

322
00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:00.034
Yes. I am. Dad. so I
can forget everything

323
00:13:00.034 --> 00:13:00.474
Yes. I am. Dad. so I
can forget everything

324
00:13:00.994 --> 00:13:02.034
Where is Fathi?

325
00:13:02.354 --> 00:13:03.874
He went out with your mother

326
00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:06.034
May she rest in peace. Dad

327
00:13:06.034 --> 00:13:06.394
May she rest in peace. Dad

328
00:13:07.434 --> 00:13:09.194
May she rest in peace. Dad!

329
00:13:09.674 --> 00:13:12.034
- "May she rest in peace"
- Dad

330
00:13:12.154 --> 00:13:13.714
- "May she rest in peace"
- What is it?

331
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.954
Uncle Issam has been
looking for you since he arrived

332
00:13:16.074 --> 00:13:17.354
and he doesn't know you're here

333
00:13:18.114 --> 00:13:20.354
All of us in this house are
looking for something. Zeko

334
00:13:20.794 --> 00:13:22.514
Looks like your mom is right

335
00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:24.034
Dad. why do you and mom always fight?

336
00:13:24.034 --> 00:13:26.194
Dad. why do you and mom always fight?

337
00:13:26.314 --> 00:13:28.354
Will all those fights ever end?

338
00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:29.714
Yes. they will

339
00:13:30.194 --> 00:13:33.394
But life was unfair to
us and suffocated us

340
00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:36.034
Its pressure gets worse with
time and leaves us on our nerves

341
00:13:36.034 --> 00:13:37.154
Its pressure gets worse with
time and leaves us on our nerves

342
00:13:37.674 --> 00:13:39.874
We can't stand a single
word from each other

343
00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:42.034
- Dad
- What?

344
00:13:42.034 --> 00:13:43.194
- Dad
- What?

345
00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:44.954
What are we living for?

346
00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:46.514
What?

347
00:13:46.834 --> 00:13:47.954
What's this question. Zeko?

348
00:13:48.074 --> 00:13:50.074
Are watching the
educational Nile channel?

349
00:13:50.194 --> 00:13:52.994
I thought about it and
decided to ask this question

350
00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:59.674
We live to wake up in
the morning. go to work

351
00:14:00.074 --> 00:14:03.274
and earn some money. then we
go back home to eat and go to sleep

352
00:14:04.074 --> 00:14:05.314

Then. we eat and go to sleep

360
00:14:19.954 --> 00:14:21.914

Great. then what?

We wake up in the morning

370
00:14:36.034 --> 00:14:37.354
We wake up in the morning

371
00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:38.834
Then. we eat and go to sleep

378
00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:49.314
We wake up in the morning

379
00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:51.274
Then. we eat and go to sleep

380
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:01.954
Fathi

381
00:15:02.394 --> 00:15:03.634
Fathi!

382
00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:05.514
- Fathi!
- What is it?

383
00:15:05.674 --> 00:15:06.034
What's the matter. Issam?

384
00:15:06.034 --> 00:15:06.994
What's the matter. Issam?

385
00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:08.514
Some people are
waiting for you downstairs

386
00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:10.194
to talk about Zeko. they
said they wanted his dad

387
00:15:10.314 --> 00:15:12.034
Oh my God! Could it be
that he hurt some kid's head?

388
00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:13.154
Oh my God! Could it be
that he hurt some kid's head?

389
00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:16.794
- Damn you. Safaa
- What's the matter. Son?

390
00:15:17.154 --> 00:15:18.034
What's this!

391
00:15:18.034 --> 00:15:18.314
What's this!

392
00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:27.634
- "Can you tell us what your name is?"
- "Zakaria"

393
00:15:27.754 --> 00:15:29.994
- Where are they?
- There they are! The guy and the girl

394
00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:33.874
What's wrong? What did
he do? What did you do?

395
00:15:33.994 --> 00:15:35.634
- Are you his dad?
- Yes. I am

396
00:15:35.754 --> 00:15:36.034
- What did you do. Son?
- He didn't do anything

397
00:15:36.034 --> 00:15:37.354
- What did you do. Son?
- He didn't do anything

398
00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:39.794
I'm here to interview him
before he gets into the contest

399
00:15:39.914 --> 00:15:42.034
- What contest?
- "The Smartest Kid in Egypt"

400
00:15:42.794 --> 00:15:44.434
What does my son have to do
with "The Smartest Kid in Egypt"?

401
00:15:44.554 --> 00:15:48.034
The Ministry of Education rated him as
one of the three smartest kids in Egypt

402
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:48.674
The Ministry of Education rated him as
one of the three smartest kids in Egypt

403
00:15:49.194 --> 00:15:50.194
My son?

404
00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:51.354
Him!

405
00:15:51.754 --> 00:15:53.394
We used to feed him
"Mofataqa" as a baby

406
00:15:53.514 --> 00:15:54.034
"What's wrong? Which
of you is his father?"

407
00:15:54.034 --> 00:15:55.914
"What's wrong? Which
of you is his father?"

408
00:15:56.034 --> 00:15:57.794
- What's wrong?
- Come see your son

409
00:15:57.914 --> 00:15:59.594
- Who is this?
- He's the registrar

410
00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:00.034
Go now. please. I'll talk to you later

411
00:16:00.034 --> 00:16:02.114
Go now. please. I'll talk to you later

412
00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:03.834
Come see what your son did first

413
00:16:03.954 --> 00:16:06.034
What did he do? Don't tell me he hit
anyone. the poor boy only gets beaten

414
00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:06.314
What did he do? Don't tell me he hit
anyone. the poor boy only gets beaten

415
00:16:06.434 --> 00:16:07.834
No. Ma'am. it's not like that

416
00:16:07.954 --> 00:16:09.674
Your son is one of the
three smartest kids in Egypt

417
00:16:09.794 --> 00:16:11.674
He entered a contest
to choose the smartest kid

418
00:16:11.794 --> 00:16:12.034
Don't look at me. I'm
just as shocked as you

419
00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:13.754
Don't look at me. I'm
just as shocked as you

420
00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:16.874
The Ministry will take good care of
your son. if he wins this contest

421
00:16:16.994 --> 00:16:18.034
It'll send him to study abroad in
the biggest academies in the world

422
00:16:18.034 --> 00:16:19.194
It'll send him to study abroad in
the biggest academies in the world

423
00:16:19.314 --> 00:16:21.314
He could even become like Ahmed Zewail

424
00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:23.794
- Zewail?
- Didn't you get the letter?

425
00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:24.034
We didn't. we didn't get anything

426
00:16:24.034 --> 00:16:25.354
We didn't. we didn't get anything

427
00:16:25.474 --> 00:16:26.994
We did get a letter

428
00:16:28.674 --> 00:16:30.034
but I don't remember where I put it

429
00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:31.154
but I don't remember where I put it

430
00:16:31.274 --> 00:16:32.354
Uncle Khamis

431
00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:33.714
Dear Uncle Khamis

432
00:16:33.834 --> 00:16:35.114
Calm down and try to remember

433
00:16:35.234 --> 00:16:36.034
and I'll forgive you
for the food you ate

434
00:16:36.034 --> 00:16:37.274
and I'll forgive you
for the food you ate

435
00:16:37.394 --> 00:16:38.954
What matters is the boy's future

436
00:16:39.074 --> 00:16:42.034
Dad. please. dad remember
where exactly you put the letter

437
00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:42.514
Dad. please. dad remember
where exactly you put the letter

438
00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:43.794
What letter?

439
00:16:43.914 --> 00:16:46.434
He doesn't even remember
what happened five minutes ago!

440
00:16:46.594 --> 00:16:48.034
He might've even put
it in the refrigerator!

441
00:16:48.034 --> 00:16:48.834
He might've even put
it in the refrigerator!

442
00:16:48.954 --> 00:16:51.074
What's this mess we're in!

443
00:16:52.234 --> 00:16:53.234
Let's turn the house
upside down. Fathi

444
00:16:53.354 --> 00:16:54.034
Let's go

445
00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:54.394
Let's go

446
00:16:58.154 --> 00:16:59.834
What's wrong. Safaa? What is it?

447
00:17:28.434 --> 00:17:29.674
Get this trash out of the way!

448
00:17:29.794 --> 00:17:30.034
- What's the matter. Safaa?
- Zewail!

449
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:31.514
- What's the matter. Safaa?
- Zewail!

450
00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:33.474
Zewail!

451
00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:35.354
What's this!

452
00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:36.034
What's this! Dad lost his
memory. what's your excuse?

453
00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:38.434
What's this! Dad lost his
memory. what's your excuse?

454
00:17:38.554 --> 00:17:40.194
- What are you doing?
- I'm rolling a cigarette

455
00:17:40.314 --> 00:17:42.034
You're using the letter we
searched the whole house for?

456
00:17:42.034 --> 00:17:42.234
You're using the letter we
searched the whole house for?

457
00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:45.314
You can't throw the tobacco
away and waste it like that!

458
00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:47.834
- What's wrong with you?
- You mindless idiot

459
00:17:47.954 --> 00:17:48.034
Come on. read it

460
00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:49.074
Come on. read it

461
00:17:50.074 --> 00:17:53.194
It's true. Zakaria Fathi Khamis and the
contest will be held in Siwa Oasis

462
00:17:53.634 --> 00:17:54.034
"Protocol between the Ministries
of Education and Tourism"

463
00:17:54.034 --> 00:17:55.914
"Protocol between the Ministries
of Education and Tourism"

464
00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.434
"to revitalize domestic tourism"

465
00:17:57.594 --> 00:17:58.954
What does this mean?

466
00:17:59.194 --> 00:18:00.034
It means that some big officials met
and agreed on something important

467
00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:02.834
It means that some big officials met
and agreed on something important

468
00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:05.114
"Accommodation for the
kid and his family in the hotel"

469
00:18:05.234 --> 00:18:06.034
"one day before the contest
and the contest will be held..."

470
00:18:06.034 --> 00:18:08.114
"one day before the contest
and the contest will be held..."

471
00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:10.354
the day after tomorrow

472
00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:12.034
What about you? How do
your dad and mom treat you?

473
00:18:12.034 --> 00:18:13.114
What about you? How do
your dad and mom treat you?

474
00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:15.114
They fight every day
then they make up

475
00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:17.874
That's not what I mean. I
mean. what does your dad do?

476
00:18:18.314 --> 00:18:19.874
- Are you in a relationship?
- What?

477
00:18:20.074 --> 00:18:21.274
Are you in a relationship?

478
00:18:21.714 --> 00:18:22.834
Let's run away from here

479
00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:24.034
Marry me and I will open
a hairdressing salon for you

480
00:18:24.034 --> 00:18:26.194
Marry me and I will open
a hairdressing salon for you

481
00:18:28.114 --> 00:18:29.194
Let's go

482
00:18:32.874 --> 00:18:34.074
Can you believe this. Fathi?

483
00:18:35.034 --> 00:18:36.034
Can you believe your son is a genius?

484
00:18:36.034 --> 00:18:36.754
Can you believe your son is a genius?

485
00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:38.394
I can neither read nor write

486
00:18:38.594 --> 00:18:41.514
How could this kid. drunk Issam's
nephew. turn out to be a genius?

487
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:42.034
Of course not. Safaa

488
00:18:42.034 --> 00:18:43.074
Of course not. Safaa

489
00:18:43.234 --> 00:18:45.314
How can I believe it. it
doesn't make any sense

490
00:18:46.114 --> 00:18:48.034
But that's what the government
said. and the letter is in our hands

491
00:18:48.034 --> 00:18:48.114
But that's what the government
said. and the letter is in our hands

492
00:18:48.234 --> 00:18:50.034
Do we know better than
the government. Safaa?

493
00:18:50.154 --> 00:18:53.194
No. of course not. how could we?

494
00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:56.754
- What will we do?
- We have to leave before dawn

495
00:18:56.874 --> 00:18:58.634
Yes. let's leave before dawn

496
00:18:58.834 --> 00:19:00.034
Let's postpone the divorce for a few
days until we make sure our son is okay

497
00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:01.914
Let's postpone the divorce for a few
days until we make sure our son is okay

498
00:19:02.034 --> 00:19:03.914
Yes. that's right

499
00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:05.714
That's right. Safaa

500
00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:08.954
Do you think he'll win the contest?

501
00:19:09.074 --> 00:19:11.034
Shouldn't we go to
the contest first. Safaa?

502
00:19:11.154 --> 00:19:12.034
Traveling costs so much

503
00:19:12.034 --> 00:19:13.114
Traveling costs so much

504
00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:14.354
Why?

505
00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:16.034
How much does it
cost for three people?

506
00:19:16.314 --> 00:19:18.034
Not three. four. because
dad is coming with us

507
00:19:18.034 --> 00:19:18.754
Not three. four. because
dad is coming with us

508
00:19:19.234 --> 00:19:20.314
What did you just say?!

509
00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:22.434
Calm down. Safaa. isn't
it better than coming back

510
00:19:22.554 --> 00:19:24.034
to find that he burnt
the house down? Right?

511
00:19:24.034 --> 00:19:24.514
to find that he burnt
the house down? Right?

512
00:19:27.194 --> 00:19:29.514
If only I had a gold ring or
bracelet. I would've sold them

513
00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:33.194
Listen. I'll try to borrow some money
from one of the ladies I cook for

514
00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:35.274
One of them might be
kind enough to lend me

515
00:19:35.394 --> 00:19:36.034
How will we pay them
back the money . Safaa?

516
00:19:36.034 --> 00:19:37.034
How will we pay them
back the money . Safaa?

517
00:19:37.154 --> 00:19:38.674
Or do you want them
to call you a fraud?

518
00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:39.794
Let them say that

519
00:19:39.914 --> 00:19:42.034
I don't want my son to wander the
neighborhood in his shaggy undershirt

520
00:19:42.034 --> 00:19:43.114
I don't want my son to wander the
neighborhood in his shaggy undershirt

521
00:19:43.234 --> 00:19:44.514
and turn out like Issam

522
00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:47.034
I'll take care of it

523
00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:48.034
I'll go and won't come
back until I find a solution

524
00:19:48.034 --> 00:19:49.474
I'll go and won't come
back until I find a solution

525
00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.474
That's great. just great

526
00:19:56.754 --> 00:19:58.354
He seemed like a smart kid

527
00:19:58.754 --> 00:20:00.034
Yes. but we have a problem
with traveling and stuff like that

528
00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:01.594
Yes. but we have a problem
with traveling and stuff like that

529
00:20:01.714 --> 00:20:03.034
We need some money

530
00:20:03.194 --> 00:20:05.794
Don't you worry about money
the most important thing is the kid

531
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.234
What will you do?

532
00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:10.514
What is this question?
That's why I came to see you

533
00:20:10.674 --> 00:20:12.034
- Where will I get the money?
- From the money you're counting now

534
00:20:12.034 --> 00:20:13.314
- Where will I get the money?
- From the money you're counting now

535
00:20:13.434 --> 00:20:14.834
It's Mr. Sameer's money

536
00:20:14.954 --> 00:20:16.354
He loves money more than his kids

537
00:20:16.474 --> 00:20:18.034
Of course. he'd love
it more than your son

538
00:20:18.034 --> 00:20:18.394
Of course. he'd love
it more than your son

539
00:20:21.434 --> 00:20:22.874
I have an idea

540
00:20:23.154 --> 00:20:24.034
- What is it?
- Go to Mr. Koshary

541
00:20:24.034 --> 00:20:25.274
- What is it?
- Go to Mr. Koshary

542
00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:26.634
Is that what you think?

543
00:20:26.754 --> 00:20:28.954
I'm sorry. Fathi. things are tight

544
00:20:31.674 --> 00:20:34.314
- What do you say. Mr. Koshary?
- I'm sorry

545
00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:36.034
Things are tight. go to Mr. Sabri

546
00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:36.594
Things are tight. go to Mr. Sabri

547
00:20:36.714 --> 00:20:38.194
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

548
00:20:40.154 --> 00:20:41.314
What do you say. Mr. Sabri?

549
00:20:41.434 --> 00:20:42.034
I don't have money. Fathi
Things are tight now

550
00:20:42.034 --> 00:20:43.794
I don't have money. Fathi
Things are tight now

551
00:20:43.914 --> 00:20:45.434
Go to Mr. Hisham

552
00:20:50.394 --> 00:20:52.034
What do you say. Mr. Hisham?

553
00:20:52.674 --> 00:20:54.034
I'd give you anything. Son

554
00:20:54.234 --> 00:20:55.434
But you know how it is

555
00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:56.714
Things are tight. right?

556
00:20:56.834 --> 00:20:58.354
Why don't you go to Mr. Sameer?

557
00:20:58.674 --> 00:20:59.914
I will go to Sameer

558
00:21:03.194 --> 00:21:05.354
No. Mr. Sameer. it's okay. Mr. Sameer

559
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:06.034
I understand your circumstances

560
00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:07.034
I understand your circumstances

561
00:21:07.154 --> 00:21:09.074
Thank you very much

562
00:21:09.634 --> 00:21:10.794
Bye

563
00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.154
Has everyone become stingy?

564
00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.354
"We love those who love
us. and our joy is their joy"

565
00:21:17.514 --> 00:21:18.034
"We hate those who hate us
and we'd never meet with them"

566
00:21:18.034 --> 00:21:21.314
"We hate those who hate us
and we'd never meet with them"

567
00:21:21.434 --> 00:21:24.034
"Let's press the button
and raise the banner"

568
00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:24.674
"Let's press the button
and raise the banner"

569
00:21:24.794 --> 00:21:27.874
and now. with the big folk singer

570
00:21:27.994 --> 00:21:29.914
The bird of the Arabic song

571
00:21:30.034 --> 00:21:32.074
Hamada Burgul's successor

572
00:21:32.194 --> 00:21:36.034
who made so many people
jump and dance in their homes

573
00:21:36.034 --> 00:21:36.514
who made so many people
jump and dance in their homes

574
00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:41.514
With the little star
Zeko the Destroyer!

575
00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:42.034
I hope you get destroyed
you stupid idiot!

576
00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:44.274
I hope you get destroyed
you stupid idiot!

577
00:21:44.394 --> 00:21:46.954
Do you think he's like you? He's
going to be a genius like Zewail

578
00:21:47.074 --> 00:21:48.034
Who is this genius Zewail?
Let the kid sing. Safaa

579
00:21:48.034 --> 00:21:49.674
Who is this genius Zewail?
Let the kid sing. Safaa

580
00:21:49.794 --> 00:21:52.274
Who is Zewail? Listen
to me. drunk Issam

581
00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:53.794
What did you do to my son?

582
00:21:55.074 --> 00:21:56.234
What did you do?

583
00:21:56.354 --> 00:21:58.874
- No one loaned me the money
- What are we going to do. Fathi?

584
00:21:58.994 --> 00:22:00.034
I took care of it

585
00:22:00.034 --> 00:22:00.234
I took care of it

586
00:22:00.434 --> 00:22:02.954
We'll change our
clothes and go downstairs

587
00:22:03.074 --> 00:22:05.394
and you will do as I tell you

588
00:22:07.434 --> 00:22:09.114
Wait. come here. where are you going?

589
00:22:09.234 --> 00:22:10.314
To the bus

590
00:22:11.394 --> 00:22:12.034
I don't know how to tell you this

591
00:22:12.034 --> 00:22:13.314
I don't know how to tell you this

592
00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:15.674
But we're traveling in this van

593
00:22:16.074 --> 00:22:18.034
Oh my God. Fathi! You'll
drive us there in the hearse?

594
00:22:18.034 --> 00:22:18.634
Oh my God. Fathi! You'll
drive us there in the hearse?

595
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.434
It's not a hearse. it's called
"the humans honoring car"

596
00:22:21.594 --> 00:22:23.234
"Honoring humans"
means the dead. Fathi

597
00:22:23.354 --> 00:22:24.034
Do we only honor people
when they're dead. Safaa?

598
00:22:24.034 --> 00:22:25.954
Do we only honor people
when they're dead. Safaa?

599
00:22:26.074 --> 00:22:27.114
- Yes
- No

600
00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:28.754
We can honor them
when they're alive. too

601
00:22:28.874 --> 00:22:30.034
- I won't travel in this car
- Don't be stubborn. Safaa

602
00:22:30.034 --> 00:22:31.834
- I won't travel in this car
- Don't be stubborn. Safaa

603
00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:33.634
We have no choice
but to travel in this car

604
00:22:33.754 --> 00:22:35.514
We are one family. okay?

605
00:22:35.674 --> 00:22:36.034
- Consider it a trip
- It only takes people to the afterlife

606
00:22:36.034 --> 00:22:38.674
- Consider it a trip
- It only takes people to the afterlife

607
00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:41.594
I've been working on it for years
and I'm still alive among you. Safaa

608
00:22:42.034 --> 00:22:43.834
Let's go. Safaa. the road is long

609
00:22:44.074 --> 00:22:46.794
Think carefully about
the kid and the contest

610
00:22:51.394 --> 00:22:52.914
Okay. but I'm going
to sit in the front seat

611
00:22:53.034 --> 00:22:54.034
- I won't ride in the back with the dead
- Fair enough

612
00:22:54.034 --> 00:22:55.154
- I won't ride in the back with the dead
- Fair enough

613
00:22:55.314 --> 00:22:57.154
- Get in the back seat. Dad
- With the dead?

614
00:22:57.274 --> 00:22:58.754
Come on. get in the back seat. Dad!

615
00:22:59.034 --> 00:23:00.034
- Issam
- What?

616
00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:01.394
I leave the loft to you. Issam

617
00:23:01.514 --> 00:23:03.354
Don't worry. I'll take good care of it

618
00:23:03.474 --> 00:23:06.034
- Don't invite anyone over. Issam
- Yes. sir

619
00:23:11.154 --> 00:23:12.034
- Don't invite anyone over!
- Don't worry!

620
00:23:12.034 --> 00:23:13.314
- Don't invite anyone over!
- Don't worry!

621
00:23:14.154 --> 00:23:15.714
Hello. Samah

622
00:23:16.034 --> 00:23:18.034
Bring the rest of the girls
and come. the house is empty

623
00:23:18.034 --> 00:23:18.314
Bring the rest of the girls
and come. the house is empty

624
00:23:18.474 --> 00:23:22.474
I have sedatives and we
are going to have a good time

625
00:23:22.634 --> 00:23:24.034
We will have a great time!

626
00:23:24.034 --> 00:23:25.194
We will have a great time!

627
00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:35.834
Fathi!

628
00:23:36.074 --> 00:23:37.754
Fathi!

629
00:23:37.954 --> 00:23:39.154
Fathi!

630
00:23:39.874 --> 00:23:41.194
Fathi!

631
00:23:41.714 --> 00:23:42.034
Fathi!

632
00:23:42.034 --> 00:23:43.154
Fathi!

633
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:46.914
Fathi!

634
00:23:47.514 --> 00:23:48.034
Hey Fathi!

635
00:23:48.034 --> 00:23:48.634
Hey Fathi!

636
00:23:51.634 --> 00:23:53.394
Go faster. Fathi!

637
00:23:54.874 --> 00:23:55.914
- What?
- Oh my God!

638
00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:57.794
- What's wrong?
- Faster!

639
00:24:14.674 --> 00:24:17.114
"One after the other"

640
00:24:17.394 --> 00:24:18.034
"Don't ever get tired or give up"

641
00:24:18.034 --> 00:24:20.114
"Don't ever get tired or give up"

642
00:24:20.234 --> 00:24:22.794
"Hold on and endure
it as hard as it is"

643
00:24:22.914 --> 00:24:24.034
"This path requires action. not words"

644
00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:25.434
"This path requires action. not words"

645
00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:28.274
"Go step by step. and
things will get better"

646
00:24:28.394 --> 00:24:30.034
"Once with hardship
and once with ease"

647
00:24:30.034 --> 00:24:30.954
"Once with hardship
and once with ease"

648
00:24:31.194 --> 00:24:33.914
"You know it all. because..."

649
00:24:34.034 --> 00:24:35.474
"Since the beginning of the story"

650
00:24:35.594 --> 00:24:36.034
"one day you're in heaven
and the other in hell"

651
00:24:36.034 --> 00:24:38.834
"one day you're in heaven
and the other in hell"

652
00:24:38.954 --> 00:24:41.514
Zakaria. focus hard
and don't be afraid

653
00:24:41.674 --> 00:24:42.034
The questions will hopefully be easy

654
00:24:42.034 --> 00:24:43.354
The questions will hopefully be easy

655
00:24:43.594 --> 00:24:45.314
What will they ask me about. Mom?

656
00:24:45.434 --> 00:24:46.714
I don't know. Son

657
00:24:47.034 --> 00:24:48.034
But I heard you're a genius. you
can answer all kinds of questions

658
00:24:48.034 --> 00:24:50.274
But I heard you're a genius. you
can answer all kinds of questions

659
00:24:50.394 --> 00:24:52.274
- Really. Mom?
- Yes. dear

660
00:24:52.394 --> 00:24:53.594
Listen. Zakaria

661
00:24:53.714 --> 00:24:54.034
The government said you're
a genius. then you're a genius

662
00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.954
The government said you're
a genius. then you're a genius

663
00:24:56.074 --> 00:24:57.354
We won't question the government

664
00:24:57.474 --> 00:24:58.754
What's 3 by 3?

665
00:24:58.874 --> 00:25:00.034
- It's 9. Mom
- What a genius!

666
00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:00.474
- It's 9. Mom
- What a genius!

667
00:25:00.634 --> 00:25:02.794
Wow! This kid is a genius

668
00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:05.154
"I seek refuge in
the Lord of Daybreak"

669
00:25:06.754 --> 00:25:08.714
Play for us a song
to cheers us up. Fathi

670
00:25:08.834 --> 00:25:09.954
Gladly

671
00:25:13.034 --> 00:25:14.274
"I say goodbye to you"

672
00:25:15.274 --> 00:25:17.154
"and I say goodbye
to this life with you"

673
00:25:17.274 --> 00:25:18.034
We don't want to say
goodbye to life in this car. Fathi

674
00:25:18.034 --> 00:25:19.154
We don't want to say
goodbye to life in this car. Fathi

675
00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:20.434
Such bad luck!

676
00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:22.954
- I'll change it
- "I say goodbye to this life with you"

677
00:25:23.074 --> 00:25:24.034
Fathi. I left a flash drive with Hamada
Burgul's songs in your car. play it

678
00:25:24.034 --> 00:25:26.754
Fathi. I left a flash drive with Hamada
Burgul's songs in your car. play it

679
00:25:26.874 --> 00:25:28.634
My son won't listen to such singers

680
00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:30.034
Why not. Safaa? He's
always listened to them

681
00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:30.594
Why not. Safaa? He's
always listened to them

682
00:25:30.714 --> 00:25:33.314
That was before. but
things are different now

683
00:25:33.434 --> 00:25:35.794
Can I sing. Dad? I have a nice voice

684
00:25:35.914 --> 00:25:36.034
You'll do what? What will
you do? Listen to me. boy

685
00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:39.594
You'll do what? What will
you do? Listen to me. boy

686
00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:41.634
You're a genius. do you
know what that means?

687
00:25:41.754 --> 00:25:42.034
No

688
00:25:42.034 --> 00:25:42.754
No

689
00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:44.514
You'll only focus on
education and studying

690
00:25:44.714 --> 00:25:47.194
- Do you understand me?
- Can I go to the bathroom?

691
00:25:47.314 --> 00:25:48.034
Because I have to go to the bathroom
and I'm afraid this will be forbidden

692
00:25:48.034 --> 00:25:50.954
Because I have to go to the bathroom
and I'm afraid this will be forbidden

693
00:25:51.114 --> 00:25:52.514
No. you can go to the bathroom

694
00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:54.034
Wait. Zakaria. I'm going to park
the car. so you can pee all you want

695
00:25:54.034 --> 00:25:56.234
Wait. Zakaria. I'm going to park
the car. so you can pee all you want

696
00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:58.154
What should I do for
you to understand me?

697
00:25:58.714 --> 00:25:59.754
What have I been
saying since morning

698
00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:00.034
for you tell him he
can pee on the street?

699
00:26:00.034 --> 00:26:01.274
for you tell him he
can pee on the street?

700
00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:03.194
We've always peed
on the street. Safaa

701
00:26:03.314 --> 00:26:05.714
That was before
things are different now

702
00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:09.434
Polite people would
never do that. dear Zakaria

703
00:26:09.554 --> 00:26:11.434
- Yes. Mom
- "Mom"?

704
00:26:11.554 --> 00:26:12.034
Call her "Mommy"!

705
00:26:12.034 --> 00:26:12.714
Call her "Mommy"!

706
00:26:12.834 --> 00:26:14.754
All that's left is to have him
brush his teeth before bed

707
00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:16.914
I didn't hear you. repeat
what you said. drunk Issam

708
00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:18.034
I didn't say anything. Safaa

709
00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:18.154
I didn't say anything. Safaa

710
00:26:18.274 --> 00:26:20.514
Zeko is your son. and you
can raise him however you want

711
00:26:20.674 --> 00:26:21.714
His name is Zakaria

712
00:26:21.834 --> 00:26:24.034
Professor. Doctor. Counselor
and owner of the madhouse

713
00:26:24.034 --> 00:26:24.394
Professor. Doctor. Counselor
and owner of the madhouse

714
00:26:24.514 --> 00:26:25.754
Are you happy now. Safaa?

715
00:26:25.954 --> 00:26:27.834
But I still have to go to the bathroom

716
00:26:28.314 --> 00:26:30.034
Be patient and hold it in for a bit

717
00:26:30.034 --> 00:26:30.114
Be patient and hold it in for a bit

718
00:26:30.234 --> 00:26:33.194
There is a gas station and you
can do whatever you want there

719
00:26:40.274 --> 00:26:42.034
Take him to the bathroom. so I can go
to the air-conditioned area for a bit

720
00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:42.834
Take him to the bathroom. so I can go
to the air-conditioned area for a bit

721
00:26:42.954 --> 00:26:45.194
I'm going to relieve myself

722
00:26:51.434 --> 00:26:53.074
Do you want me to
get you something. Dad?

723
00:26:56.274 --> 00:26:57.754
I'll be back in five minutes

724
00:27:19.034 --> 00:27:20.514
Don't tell anyone. okay?

725
00:27:23.034 --> 00:27:24.034
Why are the prices so expensive?

726
00:27:24.034 --> 00:27:24.594
Why are the prices so expensive?

727
00:27:26.074 --> 00:27:28.434
Mom. I want this chocolate

728
00:27:29.674 --> 00:27:30.034
It costs 35 pounds

729
00:27:30.034 --> 00:27:31.194
It costs 35 pounds

730
00:27:31.514 --> 00:27:33.714
Do you know how many things
you can buy with 35 pounds?

731
00:27:40.914 --> 00:27:42.034
- Come on. let's buy it
- All right

732
00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:42.514
- Come on. let's buy it
- All right

733
00:27:42.634 --> 00:27:43.714
I won't buy this one

734
00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:46.354
I'll take this. geniuses
don't eat chocolate

735
00:27:46.474 --> 00:27:47.754
May God protect you

736
00:27:48.514 --> 00:27:49.514
Give it to me

737
00:27:50.434 --> 00:27:52.474
- How much is this?
- 10 pounds

738
00:27:54.514 --> 00:27:55.594
Okay

739
00:27:56.034 --> 00:27:58.314
Who? Zakaria! How are you doing?

740
00:27:58.434 --> 00:28:00.034
- I'm fine
- Hello. how are you. artist?

741
00:28:00.034 --> 00:28:00.194

00:28:01.914 --> 00:28:03.314
Yes. since I'm covering the contest

00:28:03.434 --> 00:28:04.874
Oh right. Mazen
and his mom are here

745
00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:06.034
- Who is Mazen?
- Wait a minute

746
00:28:06.034 --> 00:28:06.394
- Who is Mazen?
- Wait a minute

747
00:28:06.634 --> 00:28:08.714
Mrs. Mona! Would you
come for a moment?

748
00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:11.834
Is this kid in the
contest with Zakaria?

749
00:28:13.354 --> 00:28:15.594
Mazen. this is Zakaria. he'll
be in the contest with you

750
00:28:15.714 --> 00:28:17.034
These are his mom and dad

751
00:28:17.314 --> 00:28:18.034
"Hi. nice to meet you"

752
00:28:18.034 --> 00:28:19.314
"Hi. nice to meet you"

753
00:28:23.114 --> 00:28:24.034
- She's saying it's nice to meet you
- Likewise

754
00:28:24.034 --> 00:28:26.874
- She's saying it's nice to meet you
- Likewise

755
00:28:27.234 --> 00:28:28.394
Is she a foreigner?

756
00:28:28.514 --> 00:28:29.914
Not at all. I'm Egyptian

757
00:28:30.034 --> 00:28:34.674
You must've thought we were foreigners
that you talked to us in English then

758
00:28:36.234 --> 00:28:37.794
Which school does Mazen go to?

759
00:28:38.354 --> 00:28:40.274
Evolution International School

760
00:28:40.394 --> 00:28:41.394
Well done

761
00:28:41.514 --> 00:28:42.034
Which school does Zakaria go to?

762
00:28:42.034 --> 00:28:42.954
Which school does Zakaria go to?

763
00:28:43.074 --> 00:28:44.074
Ahmed Abdo

764
00:28:44.194 --> 00:28:45.434
Ahmed Abdo School

765
00:28:46.394 --> 00:28:48.034
Mr. Ahmed Abdo was a great man

766
00:28:48.034 --> 00:28:48.354
Mr. Ahmed Abdo was a great man

767
00:28:48.474 --> 00:28:50.434
There was an irrigation
canal in the area

768
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:52.514
and people put a
tree over it to cross it

769
00:28:52.714 --> 00:28:54.034
Many people slipped
while trying to cross it

770
00:28:54.034 --> 00:28:55.314
Many people slipped
while trying to cross it

771
00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:58.154
But Mr. Ahmed Abdo was
a rich man. what's the matter?

772
00:28:58.274 --> 00:29:00.034
So. he donated money
to build the bridge

773
00:29:00.034 --> 00:29:00.394
So. he donated money
to build the bridge

774
00:29:00.514 --> 00:29:03.634
So. people went to the officials and
insisted on naming the school after him

775
00:29:03.754 --> 00:29:05.594
To honor his name in the history books

776
00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.114
Okay

777
00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:12.034
We have to go now

778
00:29:12.034 --> 00:29:12.394
We have to go now

779
00:29:13.314 --> 00:29:15.954
Mazen. wish Zakaria the best of luck

780
00:29:17.154 --> 00:29:18.034
Good luck for you

781
00:29:18.034 --> 00:29:18.194
Good luck for you

782
00:29:18.354 --> 00:29:20.274
- I will kill you
- What is this?

783
00:29:20.474 --> 00:29:22.714
- What is this?
- They are kids!

784
00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:24.034
Bye

785
00:29:24.034 --> 00:29:24.754
Bye

786
00:29:24.874 --> 00:29:26.794
I have to go now. too

787
00:29:26.914 --> 00:29:29.194
- Bye. artist
- Bye

788
00:29:30.674 --> 00:29:32.834
- What did you do. Fathi?
- What's wrong?

789
00:29:32.954 --> 00:29:34.994
The woman spoke to us in
a polite and elegant manner

790
00:29:35.114 --> 00:29:36.034
and you told her about the
irrigation canal and Ahmed Abdo?

791
00:29:36.034 --> 00:29:37.034
and you told her about the
irrigation canal and Ahmed Abdo?

792
00:29:37.154 --> 00:29:39.434
I did nothing wrong. she
doesn't know Ahmed Abdo

793
00:29:39.554 --> 00:29:40.954
Ahmed Abdo!

794
00:29:44.114 --> 00:29:45.114
I want to understand
why you're acting

795
00:29:45.234 --> 00:29:46.834
as if you're living a
different lifestyle?

796
00:29:46.954 --> 00:29:48.034
We're like this. this is our life
and this is who we are. Safaa!

797
00:29:48.034 --> 00:29:49.474
We're like this. this is our life
and this is who we are. Safaa!

798
00:29:49.634 --> 00:29:50.754
You're right about our lifestyle

799
00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:52.794
but I won't let you
embarrass us in front of others

800
00:29:52.914 --> 00:29:54.034
Didn't you see how she looked at us?

801
00:29:54.034 --> 00:29:54.354
Didn't you see how she looked at us?

802
00:29:54.474 --> 00:29:57.674
How she looked at us? She didn't
She doesn't even care about us

803
00:29:57.794 --> 00:30:00.034
You've been embarrassed about
everything since we got the letter

804
00:30:00.034 --> 00:30:00.914
You've been embarrassed about
everything since we got the letter

805
00:30:01.034 --> 00:30:02.754
You're even embarrassed
by Ahmed Abdo

806
00:30:02.874 --> 00:30:04.834
Go fast! Take this juice. Son

807
00:30:04.954 --> 00:30:06.034
If I tell you not to
embarrass us. Fathi

808
00:30:06.034 --> 00:30:06.514
If I tell you not to
embarrass us. Fathi

809
00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:08.514
does it means I'm
embarrassed by our lifestyle?!

810
00:30:08.674 --> 00:30:10.074
Yes. you are. Safaa

811
00:30:10.194 --> 00:30:11.794
- What's wrong. Fathi?
- What's wrong. Safaa?

812
00:30:11.914 --> 00:30:12.034
Go fast now! What's wrong with you?

813
00:30:12.034 --> 00:30:14.154
Go fast now! What's wrong with you?

814
00:30:14.274 --> 00:30:15.994
Go. you know nothing!

815
00:30:17.114 --> 00:30:18.034
You'll stay where you are. clinging to
this hearse. as if there's no other job

816
00:30:18.034 --> 00:30:20.994
You'll stay where you are. clinging to
this hearse. as if there's no other job

817
00:30:21.114 --> 00:30:23.754
Oh my God! Say what
you usually say. Safaa

818
00:30:23.914 --> 00:30:24.034
- Say it
- I'll say it. Fathi!

819
00:30:24.034 --> 00:30:25.314
- Say it
- I'll say it. Fathi!

820
00:30:25.434 --> 00:30:27.474
You bury your head in
the sand like an ostrich!

821
00:30:27.634 --> 00:30:28.754
Sand and ostrich?

822
00:30:29.034 --> 00:30:30.034
Where did you come up with
this when you're illiterate. Safaa?

823
00:30:30.034 --> 00:30:32.074
Where did you come up with
this when you're illiterate. Safaa?

824
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.194
Are you judging me. Fathi?

825
00:30:35.154 --> 00:30:36.034
That's not what I meant. Safaa

826
00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:36.914
That's not what I meant. Safaa

827
00:30:39.474 --> 00:30:41.154
These shoes suit you very well. Safaa

828
00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:42.034
Don't try to compliment me now

829
00:30:42.034 --> 00:30:43.434
Don't try to compliment me now

830
00:30:43.994 --> 00:30:45.194
Where is grandpa?

831
00:30:48.154 --> 00:30:49.874
- Where is your dad?
- I don't know

832
00:30:49.994 --> 00:30:51.354
Who knows where he is then?

833
00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:54.034
I went to the store with you and
didn't see him when I came back

834
00:30:54.034 --> 00:30:54.674
I went to the store with you and
didn't see him when I came back

835
00:30:55.194 --> 00:30:56.794
Maybe he's at the gas station

836
00:30:56.914 --> 00:30:59.274
- Let's go to him before he gets lost
- No! No!

837
00:30:59.514 --> 00:31:00.034
We can't go back there again

838
00:31:00.034 --> 00:31:02.314
We can't go back there again

839
00:31:02.474 --> 00:31:04.274
What's the matter?
What did you do. Issam?

840
00:31:04.394 --> 00:31:06.034
Nothing. the kid wanted a few
things. so I got them for him

841
00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:06.834
Nothing. the kid wanted a few
things. so I got them for him

842
00:31:06.994 --> 00:31:08.954
But I think I forgot to pay for them

843
00:31:09.274 --> 00:31:12.034
You forgot to pay for it
or you stole them. Issam?

844
00:31:12.034 --> 00:31:12.434
You forgot to pay for it
or you stole them. Issam?

845
00:31:12.554 --> 00:31:14.314
Won't you quit this habit?

846
00:31:23.474 --> 00:31:24.034
Excuse me. a man who was with us took
these items and forgot to pay for them

847
00:31:24.034 --> 00:31:26.714
Excuse me. a man who was with us took
these items and forgot to pay for them

848
00:31:26.834 --> 00:31:28.434
You mean he stole them
not forgot to pay for them

849
00:31:28.594 --> 00:31:30.034
No. we're returning them. he
took a bottle of juice and chips

850
00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:32.154
No. we're returning them. he
took a bottle of juice and chips

851
00:31:32.274 --> 00:31:33.514
and this is the money for them

852
00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:36.034
Excuse me. have you seen an old man?

853
00:31:36.034 --> 00:31:36.394
Excuse me. have you seen an old man?

854
00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:38.914
- Wait. I'll check the security cameras
- No. please

855
00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:41.754
Don't check them. we
already paid you for the items

856
00:31:41.874 --> 00:31:42.034
- Let's go. Fathi
- No. I want to see dad in the cameras

857
00:31:42.034 --> 00:31:43.874
- Let's go. Fathi
- No. I want to see dad in the cameras

858
00:31:43.994 --> 00:31:46.954
This way. Issam will show up in the
camera footage stealing those items

859
00:31:47.634 --> 00:31:48.034
You're right. but I locked the car
with him in it. he won't do anything

860
00:31:48.034 --> 00:31:50.954
You're right. but I locked the car
with him in it. he won't do anything

861
00:31:51.314 --> 00:31:52.354
Let's find the man. Fathi

862
00:31:52.474 --> 00:31:54.034
- Uncle Khamis!
- Grandpa Khamis!

863
00:31:54.034 --> 00:31:54.354
- Uncle Khamis!
- Grandpa Khamis!

864
00:31:54.474 --> 00:31:56.034
- Dad!

865
00:31:56.154 --> 00:31:58.154
- Grandpa Khamis!
- Listen to me

866
00:31:58.274 --> 00:32:00.034
Didn't you see a short
man who's a womanizer?

867
00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:00.274
Didn't you see a short
man who's a womanizer?

868
00:32:01.034 --> 00:32:02.674
Mr. Khamis

869
00:32:07.394 --> 00:32:09.074
Mr. Khamis

870
00:32:14.394 --> 00:32:15.434
Yes?

871
00:32:15.874 --> 00:32:17.194
No. that's not my dad

872
00:32:17.874 --> 00:32:18.034
I haven't done anything yet

873
00:32:18.034 --> 00:32:19.474
I haven't done anything yet

874
00:32:26.514 --> 00:32:28.794
I can't tell whether you're
my dad or not from this sound

875
00:32:28.914 --> 00:32:30.034
Say something. so I
can know who you are

876
00:32:30.034 --> 00:32:30.674
Say something. so I
can know who you are

877
00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:35.514
look over there

878
00:32:35.874 --> 00:32:36.034

"He woke up with regrets"

882
00:32:40.394 --> 00:32:42.034
"because he was feeling sick"

883
00:32:42.034 --> 00:32:42.274
"because he was feeling sick"

884
00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:45.954
"He got slapped again
and again under the tree"

885
00:32:46.194 --> 00:32:47.394
"Abdo"

886
00:32:48.354 --> 00:32:49.474
"Woke up"

887
00:32:55.194 --> 00:32:56.594

What's this?

905
00:33:19.634 --> 00:33:21.194
Why was I sleeping in the casket?

906
00:33:21.794 --> 00:33:24.034
You want me to die
alive. you bastards?

907
00:33:24.034 --> 00:33:24.114

930
00:34:07.474 --> 00:34:09.674
Won't you quit those habits of yours?

931
00:34:09.954 --> 00:34:11.754
Is it okay for Zakaria's
uncle to be a thief?

932
00:34:12.274 --> 00:34:13.634
Is it okay to deprive
him of what he desires

933
00:34:13.754 --> 00:34:16.594
and what he sees with his
friends? Are we heartless

934
00:34:16.794 --> 00:34:18.034
and you. Dad

935
00:34:18.034 --> 00:34:18.074

I want to understand how you
thought of ??sleeping in the casket

937
00:34:21.514 --> 00:34:23.074
Did I sleep in the casket?

938
00:34:23.514 --> 00:34:24.034
Do you think I'm a fool
to sleep in the casket?

939
00:34:24.034 --> 00:34:26.154
Do you think I'm a fool
to sleep in the casket?

940
00:34:26.354 --> 00:34:29.354
- You're so funny. Uncle Khamis
- It's okay. it's okay

941
00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:32.314
Hello. Mr. Sameer?

I'm going with my family
to Siwa in the car

944
00:34:36.034 --> 00:34:36.474
I'm going with my family
to Siwa in the car

945
00:34:36.634 --> 00:34:39.154
My son has a contest there. I
hope the same happens for your son

Kids in Egypt" contest

947
00:34:41.474 --> 00:34:42.034

00:34:48.474 --> 00:34:50.674
Get another car. Mr. Sameer

951
00:34:52.474 --> 00:34:54.034
Does the dead man only want
to ride in my car. Mr. Sameer?

952
00:34:54.034 --> 00:34:56.834
Does the dead man only want
to ride in my car. Mr. Sameer?

953
00:34:58.274 --> 00:35:00.034
You want me to give up my
son's future for a dead man?

954
00:35:00.034 --> 00:35:01.234
You want me to give up my
son's future for a dead man?

955
00:35:01.794 --> 00:35:03.874

956
00:35:04.194 --> 00:35:06.034
I'll pay you when I get back from Siwa

957
00:35:06.154 --> 00:35:07.234
Bye

958
00:35:08.634 --> 00:35:11.434
Did you take the car without
its owner's permission. Fathi?

959
00:35:12.714 --> 00:35:13.714
He's a stingy man

960
00:35:13.834 --> 00:35:16.354
If I told him anything. he would've
asked me to leave the money

961
00:35:16.474 --> 00:35:17.594
before making a move

962
00:35:18.634 --> 00:35:19.914
You got mad because
your brother took stuff

963
00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:21.954
from the supermarket
without paying for them?

964
00:35:24.474 --> 00:35:25.634
Fathi

965
00:35:26.154 --> 00:35:28.354
Let's go home to eat

966
00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:30.034
I am hungry

967
00:35:30.034 --> 00:35:30.114
I am hungry

968
00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:32.074
Me too. Dad

969
00:35:33.354 --> 00:35:34.434
Okay

970
00:35:41.034 --> 00:35:42.034
What's the matter. Safaa? Will
you keep looking at me this way?

971
00:35:42.034 --> 00:35:43.634
What's the matter. Safaa? Will
you keep looking at me this way?

972
00:35:43.834 --> 00:35:46.194
I said I'll take care
of it when we get back

973
00:35:46.314 --> 00:35:47.474
Oh my God!

974
00:35:47.794 --> 00:35:48.034
- How could the genius' dad...
- Eat in silence!

975
00:35:48.034 --> 00:35:50.674
- How could the genius' dad...
- Eat in silence!

976
00:35:50.794 --> 00:35:51.914
I'm eating. Brother

977
00:35:52.354 --> 00:35:54.034
Thank you. mother of genius

978
00:35:54.034 --> 00:35:54.994
Thank you. mother of genius
the food is very delicious

979
00:35:55.114 --> 00:35:56.154
I hope it poisons you

980
00:35:56.354 --> 00:36:00.034
You even put it in boxes and wrapped
it in plastic bags like rich people

981
00:36:00.034 --> 00:36:02.034
You even put it in boxes and wrapped
it in plastic bags like rich people

982
00:36:02.394 --> 00:36:04.754
Did you inherit something or what?

983
00:36:05.634 --> 00:36:06.034
I have to find a way to return the
money to the lady when we get back

984
00:36:06.034 --> 00:36:08.394
I have to find a way to return the
money to the lady when we get back

985
00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:09.954
What will you return?

986
00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:12.034
So. you're judging me for
taking the car from the man

987
00:36:12.034 --> 00:36:12.874
So. you're judging me for
taking the car from the man

988
00:36:12.994 --> 00:36:14.874
when you took the customer's food?!

989
00:36:14.994 --> 00:36:16.474
Oh my God!

990
00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:18.034
Do you think it's appropriate. mother
of the genius? So. we're all thieves

991
00:36:18.034 --> 00:36:19.514
Do you think it's appropriate. mother
of the genius? So. we're all thieves

992
00:36:19.674 --> 00:36:21.114
Be proud of your family. Genius!

993
00:36:21.234 --> 00:36:24.034
Let us enjoy your silence!
I did what I did for him

994
00:36:24.034 --> 00:36:24.074
Let us enjoy your silence!
I did what I did for him

995
00:36:24.194 --> 00:36:27.314
- And I took the car for him
- I took those things for him. too

996
00:36:27.434 --> 00:36:28.954
Didn't you say you wanted juice?

997
00:36:29.074 --> 00:36:30.034
Tell your mom you wanted it!

998
00:36:30.034 --> 00:36:30.594
Tell your mom you wanted it!

999
00:36:30.714 --> 00:36:31.834
That's enough!

1000
00:36:31.954 --> 00:36:34.714
We're all wrong and we'll fix
these disasters when we return

1001
00:36:37.434 --> 00:36:38.434
Yes. man?

1002
00:36:44.474 --> 00:36:48.034
I'm glad you told me

I'm glad you told me
so I can take precautions

1004
00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:50.914

- What's wrong?
- That guy is being mean

1006
00:36:54.034 --> 00:36:54.154
- What's wrong?
- That guy is being mean

1007
00:36:54.274 --> 00:36:55.794
He reported the car stolen

1008
00:36:56.354 --> 00:36:58.314
and told the authorities
we're driving it to Siwa

1009
00:36:59.714 --> 00:37:00.034
Why are we going to Sinai
in this hot weather. Son?

1010
00:37:00.034 --> 00:37:02.234
Why are we going to Sinai
in this hot weather. Son?

1011
00:37:02.634 --> 00:37:04.114
Don't worry. Uncle Khamis

1012
00:37:12.874 --> 00:37:13.994
What now?

1013
00:37:14.874 --> 00:37:16.114
We'll keep going. Safaa

1014
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:17.674
How will we keep going. Fathi?

1015
00:37:18.434 --> 00:37:20.234
- Do we go back then?
- Yeah. let's go back

1016
00:37:20.354 --> 00:37:23.914
Otherwise. something bad might happen
to you. God forbid. you're all we have

1017
00:37:34.354 --> 00:37:35.954
We'll keep going. Safaa

1018
00:38:02.874 --> 00:38:05.074
- Slow down. Fathi
- What can I do. Safaa?

1019
00:38:05.194 --> 00:38:06.034
This is the only route that's
out of the government's sight

1020
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:07.514
This is the only route that's
out of the government's sight

1021
00:38:07.674 --> 00:38:09.874
Slow down. Son. you're making me sick

1022
00:38:11.034 --> 00:38:12.034
Bear with us. Uncle Khamis

1023
00:38:12.034 --> 00:38:12.514
Bear with us. Uncle Khamis

1024
00:38:12.794 --> 00:38:15.314
He's used to driving the dead
and the dead don't complain

1025
00:38:15.434 --> 00:38:17.354
May God give me patience

1026
00:38:17.914 --> 00:38:18.034
What is that? What is that? Stop!

1027
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:20.634
What is that? What is that? Stop!

1028
00:38:26.914 --> 00:38:28.434
What brought this car here?

1029
00:38:28.554 --> 00:38:29.834
Forget about why it's here

1030
00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:30.034
Wasn't the desert big enough
for her to hit the only tree here?

1031
00:38:30.034 --> 00:38:32.754
Wasn't the desert big enough
for her to hit the only tree here?

1032
00:38:33.474 --> 00:38:35.914
Let's see if anyone needs help. Safaa

1033
00:38:36.034 --> 00:38:37.394
No. Fathi. what if there's thieves

1034
00:38:37.514 --> 00:38:39.234
who want to steal
everything we have in it?

1035
00:38:39.354 --> 00:38:40.674
Steal everything we have?

1036
00:38:41.034 --> 00:38:42.034
Let's see. if anyone needs help. Safaa

1037
00:38:42.034 --> 00:38:43.314
Let's see. if anyone needs help. Safaa

1038
00:38:43.434 --> 00:38:45.154
Well done. Superman!

1039
00:38:45.274 --> 00:38:47.474
Be proud of your family. Genius!

1040
00:38:47.634 --> 00:38:48.034
Be proud of them!

1041
00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:48.914
Be proud of them!

1042
00:38:55.234 --> 00:38:56.914
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

1043
00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:58.034
She is dead!

1044
00:38:58.154 --> 00:38:59.514
My future is doomed. Fathi!

1045
00:38:59.794 --> 00:39:00.034
- My future is doomed. Fathi!
- Stop it!

1046
00:39:00.034 --> 00:39:01.914
- My future is doomed. Fathi!
- Stop it!

1047
00:39:02.034 --> 00:39:03.794
My future is doomed. Fathi!

1048
00:39:04.754 --> 00:39:06.034
"Oh good Lord. good Lord!"

1049
00:39:06.034 --> 00:39:07.434
"Oh good Lord. good Lord!"

1050
00:39:07.634 --> 00:39:09.514
- Who are you?
- What are you!

1051
00:39:09.634 --> 00:39:10.954
Don't worry

1052
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.034
I'm not dead

1053
00:39:12.034 --> 00:39:12.714
I'm not dead

1054
00:39:13.474 --> 00:39:15.354
I am a human being just like you

1055
00:39:15.474 --> 00:39:17.594
This is my costume for a
costume party I was going to

1056
00:39:17.714 --> 00:39:18.034
My car broke down and there's no signal
to call someone to come and get me

1057
00:39:18.034 --> 00:39:20.634
My car broke down and there's no signal
to call someone to come and get me

1058
00:39:20.754 --> 00:39:21.874
Let's take her with us

1059
00:39:22.474 --> 00:39:23.474
She's a gift from God!

1060
00:39:23.634 --> 00:39:24.034
Stop. Dad! Where are you going?

1061
00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:25.114
Stop. Dad! Where are you going?

1062
00:39:25.274 --> 00:39:26.714
The place isn't far from here

1063
00:39:26.834 --> 00:39:28.314
I'll pay you whatever you want

1064
00:39:28.474 --> 00:39:30.034
But something bad might happen
to me. if I stay alone in the desert

1065
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.234
But something bad might happen
to me. if I stay alone in the desert

1066
00:39:31.714 --> 00:39:33.674
It's okay. Fathi. I feel sorry for her

1067
00:39:33.794 --> 00:39:35.114
Let's take her with us
we may be rewarded

1068
00:39:35.234 --> 00:39:36.034
You're running out of fuel. Safaa

1069
00:39:36.034 --> 00:39:36.594
You're running out of fuel. Safaa

1070
00:39:36.714 --> 00:39:38.434
God will save us. she is a woman

1071
00:39:38.554 --> 00:39:40.594
Don't say a woman
please. I'm a feminist

1072
00:39:40.714 --> 00:39:41.754
What's wrong with you?

1073
00:39:42.114 --> 00:39:44.714
She's sick. Safaa. as
a cleaver pierced her head

1074
00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:47.354
- Help me support her. Issam
- Why do you need Issam?

1075
00:39:47.474 --> 00:39:48.034
Your dad is still strong

1076
00:39:48.034 --> 00:39:48.474
Your dad is still strong

1077
00:39:48.634 --> 00:39:50.354
- Calm down. Uncle Khamis
- Stop. please. Dad!

1078
00:39:51.954 --> 00:39:53.434
Take it easy. okay

1079
00:39:53.794 --> 00:39:54.034
Don't touch her. Fathi

1080
00:39:54.034 --> 00:39:55.194
Don't touch her. Fathi

1081
00:39:55.314 --> 00:39:56.634
Stop it. Safaa

1082
00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:58.954
Watch out for the cleaver. Issam

1083
00:40:00.074 --> 00:40:02.274
- Thank you very much
- You're most welcome

1084
00:40:02.394 --> 00:40:03.914
We did what we had to do

1085
00:40:41.114 --> 00:40:42.034
Come here. Miss

1086
00:40:42.034 --> 00:40:42.354
Come here. Miss

1087
00:40:43.914 --> 00:40:45.114
Take the money. please

1088
00:40:45.354 --> 00:40:47.354
No. we did you a favor
We can't possibly do that

1089
00:40:47.474 --> 00:40:48.034
Take it for the fuel. I don't know
what I would've done without you

1090
00:40:48.034 --> 00:40:50.594
Take it for the fuel. I don't know
what I would've done without you

1091
00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:52.714
Thank you. dear. have a nice evening

1092
00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:54.034
Do you want to go?

1093
00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:54.154
Do you want to go?

1094
00:40:54.514 --> 00:40:56.394
Come with me. you're
going to have a great time

1095
00:40:56.714 --> 00:40:58.234
Hello. Superman!

1096
00:40:59.194 --> 00:41:00.034
Excuse us. Miss. we
don't have costumes on

1097
00:41:00.034 --> 00:41:02.994
Excuse us. Miss. we
don't have costumes on

1098
00:41:03.114 --> 00:41:04.114
Yes

1099
00:41:04.234 --> 00:41:06.034
Consider my offer. you'll have
a good time. if you come inside

1100
00:41:06.034 --> 00:41:06.714
Consider my offer. you'll have
a good time. if you come inside

1101
00:41:06.834 --> 00:41:08.034
- Okay
- Bye. thank you

1102
00:41:08.154 --> 00:41:09.234
- See you later
- Goodbye

1103
00:41:09.354 --> 00:41:10.954
Listen. Safaa. what do you think?

1104
00:41:11.074 --> 00:41:12.034
What? Do you want us
to go in looking like this?

1105
00:41:12.034 --> 00:41:12.954
What? Do you want us
to go in looking like this?

1106
00:41:13.074 --> 00:41:15.394
What's wrong with us? Don't you
see how the people around us look?

1107
00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:17.394
A murdered girl just walked in!

1108
00:41:18.034 --> 00:41:20.394
Let's go in. eat and
gather our strength

1109
00:41:20.514 --> 00:41:22.954
- What about our son?
- He'll stay asleep. we won't be late

1110
00:41:23.074 --> 00:41:24.034
We'll put food for him in a
plastic bag. if you have one

1111
00:41:24.034 --> 00:41:25.274
We'll put food for him in a
plastic bag. if you have one

1112
00:41:25.394 --> 00:41:27.154
No need. there are two
sandwiches in the bag

1113
00:41:27.274 --> 00:41:29.114
But Issam and your dad
will get us into trouble

1114
00:41:29.234 --> 00:41:30.034
No. Issam won't do that. Issam!

1115
00:41:30.034 --> 00:41:30.994
No. Issam won't do that. Issam!

1116
00:41:33.834 --> 00:41:36.034
- Where did they go?
- They went ahead of us

1117
00:41:36.034 --> 00:41:36.074
- Where did they go?
- They went ahead of us

1118
00:41:36.874 --> 00:41:38.114
I hope nothing wrong happens

1119
00:41:45.794 --> 00:41:47.514
Women!

1120
00:41:47.914 --> 00:41:48.034
Women. Fathi!

1121
00:41:48.034 --> 00:41:50.634
Women. Fathi!

1122
00:42:11.314 --> 00:42:12.034
Come to me one by one

1123
00:42:12.034 --> 00:42:12.994
Come to me one by one

1124
00:42:13.434 --> 00:42:15.034
I can't handle you all together

1125
00:42:15.754 --> 00:42:18.034
Come on. come to me

1126
00:42:18.034 --> 00:42:18.274
Come on. come to me

1127
00:42:40.834 --> 00:42:42.034
Give it up for...

1128
00:42:42.034 --> 00:42:42.314
Give it up for...

1129
00:42:42.434 --> 00:42:45.994
The queen Ostah Bashee

1130
00:42:46.834 --> 00:42:48.034
what are you doing?
Wait! Put your hand down!

1131
00:42:48.034 --> 00:42:49.074
what are you doing?
Wait! Put your hand down!

1132
00:42:49.274 --> 00:42:50.834
Stop! Put her down! I said stop!

1133
00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:53.074
What's this? What? What?

1134
00:42:53.634 --> 00:42:54.034
Do you think she is
alone? She's my wife!

1135
00:42:54.034 --> 00:42:55.714
Do you think she is
alone? She's my wife!

1136
00:42:56.634 --> 00:42:59.034
Get away from her! What's
wrong with these people. Safaa?

1137
00:42:59.154 --> 00:43:00.034
They're spoiling me. Fathi
No one did that in a long time

1138
00:43:00.034 --> 00:43:01.474
They're spoiling me. Fathi
No one did that in a long time

1139
00:43:01.594 --> 00:43:03.994
How could you say that?!

1140
00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.634
You said we should come in

1141
00:43:05.754 --> 00:43:06.034
We came in to eat. not to swing. Safaa

1142
00:43:06.034 --> 00:43:07.994
We came in to eat. not to swing. Safaa

1143
00:43:08.154 --> 00:43:10.074
You look great when
you're mad and jealous. Fathi

1144
00:43:10.194 --> 00:43:12.034
I'm jealous and I spoil you. Safaa

1145
00:43:12.794 --> 00:43:13.954
Nice dress

1146
00:43:14.234 --> 00:43:15.634
Get away from her!

1147
00:43:15.794 --> 00:43:17.074
What is wrong with you!

1148
00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:18.034
What did he say?

1149
00:43:18.034 --> 00:43:18.834
What did he say?

1150
00:43:18.954 --> 00:43:20.074
He didn't say anything

1151
00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:24.034
"What do you know about
rolling down in the deep?"

1152
00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:26.754
"What do you know about
rolling down in the deep?"

1153
00:43:26.874 --> 00:43:29.754
"When your brain goes numb
you can call that mental freeze"

1154
00:43:29.954 --> 00:43:30.034
"When these people talk too
much. put that shit in slow motion"

1155
00:43:30.034 --> 00:43:32.914
"When these people talk too
much. put that shit in slow motion"

1156
00:43:33.034 --> 00:43:35.914
"Yeah. I feel like an
astronaut in the ocean"

1157
00:43:36.074 --> 00:43:38.954
"What do you know about
rolling down in the deep?"

1158
00:43:39.114 --> 00:43:42.034
"When your brain goes numb
you can call that mental freeze"

1159
00:43:42.034 --> 00:43:42.114
"When your brain goes numb
you can call that mental freeze"

1160
00:43:42.514 --> 00:43:44.114
Why are they looking at us like that?

1161
00:43:45.034 --> 00:43:46.594
Do you think they despise us?

1162
00:43:47.034 --> 00:43:48.034
They like us. Safaa

1163
00:43:48.034 --> 00:43:48.714
They like us. Safaa

1164
00:43:49.234 --> 00:43:50.514
Let's eat

1165
00:43:50.874 --> 00:43:54.034
Come on

1166
00:43:54.034 --> 00:43:54.394
Come on

1167
00:43:55.514 --> 00:43:57.154
Oh my God!

1168
00:44:06.034 --> 00:44:07.274
Good evening

1169
00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:10.834
Your costumes are cool

1170
00:44:34.234 --> 00:44:35.474
What is this?

1171
00:44:35.834 --> 00:44:36.034
Is this Ali Baba's treasure?

1172
00:44:36.034 --> 00:44:37.674
Is this Ali Baba's treasure?

1173
00:44:39.714 --> 00:44:42.034
Put everything back where it was

1174
00:44:47.114 --> 00:44:48.034
Do you know how to use this
thing you're holding. Grandma?

1175
00:44:48.034 --> 00:44:49.434
Do you know how to use this
thing you're holding. Grandma?

1176
00:44:49.874 --> 00:44:50.954
- What's this?
- Don't worry

1177
00:44:51.074 --> 00:44:52.794
Maybe they're setting
off fireworks outside

1178
00:44:52.914 --> 00:44:54.034
Hurry up before anyone notices us

1179
00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:54.394
Hurry up before anyone notices us

1180
00:44:54.514 --> 00:44:55.834
- Let's go
- Come on

1181
00:44:56.154 --> 00:44:58.754
- That's enough. I also put rice
- All right

1182
00:45:08.434 --> 00:45:09.634
Look

1183

00:45:12.434 --> 00:45:14.634
Is there anyone as
poor as us. Safaa?

1185
00:45:14.954 --> 00:45:16.874
He seems to work for them

1186
00:45:17.594 --> 00:45:18.034
Looks like he really came
to the party by mistake

1187
00:45:18.034 --> 00:45:19.834
Looks like he really came
to the party by mistake

1188
00:45:20.354 --> 00:45:22.394
Let's go help him

Don't expose us. you'll be kicked out!

1197
00:45:38.474 --> 00:45:40.834
Who will be kicked out
and who will expose you?

1198
00:45:40.954 --> 00:45:42.034
I am impressed by your real abilities

1199

you charity without even knowing you

1203
00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:50.994
If I see you on the street. I'd give
you charity without even knowing you

1204

- What is he saying?
- I don't know

1205
00:45:54.954 --> 00:45:56.714
What's wrong. Safaa? I don't
get what he's talking about

1206
00:45:56.834 --> 00:45:58.114

Everyone who heard the idea
was just as impressed by the way

1231
00:46:41.514 --> 00:46:42.034
This is my mom's idea
not mine by the way

1232
00:46:42.034 --> 00:46:43.114
This is my mom's idea
not mine by the way

1233
00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:44.794
She's been into
hunting for a long time

1234
00:46:44.914 --> 00:46:47.874
So. she suggested building a
five square acres farm or club

1235
00:46:47.994 --> 00:46:48.034
so we can all hunt
hares and have fun there

1236
00:46:48.034 --> 00:46:49.794
so we can all hunt
hares and have fun there

I am so scared of the press

1249
00:47:11.714 --> 00:47:12.034
Don't worry. it'll
be our little secret

1250
00:47:12.034 --> 00:47:13.674
Don't worry. it'll
be our little secret

1251
00:47:13.794 --> 00:47:16.114
Only the donors and
hunters will know about it

1260
00:47:30.034 --> 00:47:31.194
We almost begged for money
to take our son to the contest

1261
00:47:31.314 --> 00:47:32.994
This is not the time for this

Why are you carrying me like that?

1285
00:48:26.154 --> 00:48:27.514
It's nothing. Dad

1286

- Put your robe on to look good
- Alright

1288
00:48:30.634 --> 00:48:32.634
It's just that you
got tired of walking

1289
00:48:32.754 --> 00:48:35.354
- So we decided to carry you to rest
- May God keep you healthy

I don't know. why don't
you sneak in and look for him?

1294
00:48:41.674 --> 00:48:42.034
Sneak in and look for him?

1295
00:48:42.034 --> 00:48:42.834
Sneak in and look for him?

1296
00:48:42.954 --> 00:48:44.154

1303
00:49:02.514 --> 00:49:05.354
- and who's that woman?
- She's a crazy woman

1304
00:49:05.474 --> 00:49:06.034
I found an empty room
and I just wanted to rest in it

1305
00:49:06.034 --> 00:49:08.874
I found an empty room
and I just wanted to rest in it

1306
00:49:08.994 --> 00:49:11.994
So. she walked in. pointed her gun
at me and wanted to attack me. Fathi

1307
00:49:12.114 --> 00:49:14.914
Stop beating around the bushes
and tell me what you stole. Issam?

1308
00:49:15.194 --> 00:49:16.434
I couldn't steal anything

1309
00:49:17.434 --> 00:49:18.034
Stop asking questions and watch
the road. father of the genius

We will go to rest at the
hotel until the contest begins

1315
00:49:46.074 --> 00:49:47.674
The road is very deserted

1316
00:49:48.034 --> 00:49:50.314
No one will hear about us
if a killer appears and kills us

1317
00:49:50.434 --> 00:49:53.354
No one will hear about us if someone
attacks us in our house either. Safaa

00:50:56.634 --> 00:50:58.514
Push. you lazy Issam!

1351
00:51:00.914 --> 00:51:04.114
It's not going out this way
Fathi. it needs a winch!

1352
00:51:07.874 --> 00:51:09.154
Listen to me

1353
00:51:09.394 --> 00:51:11.674
Let's call someone to help us

1354
00:51:11.834 --> 00:51:12.034
- There's no service here
- Let's walk then

1355
00:51:12.034 --> 00:51:14.194
- There's no service here
- Let's walk then

1356
00:51:14.314 --> 00:51:16.674
We'll be there in three
or four days if we walk

1357
00:51:18.994 --> 00:51:20.714
How about we walk to the highway

1358
00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:22.714
We might find a good
person who can help us

1359
00:51:22.834 --> 00:51:24.034
We can't walk this
road at night. Safaa

1360
00:51:24.034 --> 00:51:24.954
We can't walk this
road at night. Safaa

1361
00:51:41.874 --> 00:51:42.034
It's hopeless

1362
00:51:42.034 --> 00:51:43.194
It's hopeless

1363
00:51:43.314 --> 00:51:44.914
We are a miserable family

1364
00:51:52.474 --> 00:51:53.634
Issam

1365
00:51:54.154 --> 00:51:55.154
What?

1366
00:51:55.434 --> 00:51:56.874
I know you're a mean bastard

1367
00:51:57.194 --> 00:51:58.514
But you're the fittest one of us

1368
00:51:58.674 --> 00:52:00.034
Go to the highway and ask for help

1369
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:00.514
Go to the highway and ask for help

1370
00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:03.314
- He's your nephew. you gentleman
- Let's say I am a gentleman

1371
00:52:03.754 --> 00:52:05.794
Who would trust
someone who looks like this

1372
00:52:05.914 --> 00:52:06.034
and come to this
remote place with his car?

1373
00:52:06.034 --> 00:52:08.354
and come to this
remote place with his car?

1374
00:52:13.234 --> 00:52:14.314
Fathi

1375
00:52:14.954 --> 00:52:17.274
Is this a car or am
I imagining things?

1376
00:52:22.234 --> 00:52:23.314
Listen. Safaa

1377
00:52:23.434 --> 00:52:24.034
Take Zeko. get in the car. and lock it

1378
00:52:24.034 --> 00:52:25.074
Take Zeko. get in the car. and lock it

1379
00:52:25.194 --> 00:52:27.714
- Why? What's wrong?
- No normal cars pass through here

1380
00:52:27.834 --> 00:52:30.034
That car belongs either to the
authorities or to drug smugglers

1381
00:52:30.034 --> 00:52:30.314
That car belongs either to the
authorities or to drug smugglers

1382
00:52:30.434 --> 00:52:32.474
Take Zeko. get in the car. and lock it

1383
00:52:32.594 --> 00:52:34.714
- I won't leave you alone. Fathi
- Do as I tell you!

1384
00:52:34.834 --> 00:52:36.034
- Come on! Come on!
- Fine. as you wish

1385

00:53:29.914 --> 00:53:30.034
Stop! Stop!

1415
00:53:30.034 --> 00:53:31.274
Stop! Stop!

1416
00:53:33.754 --> 00:53:35.074
Who are you?

1417
00:53:36.474 --> 00:53:37.954
and what brought you here?

1418
00:53:38.074 --> 00:53:40.274
Excuse me. but who's
asking. who are you?

1419
00:53:40.394 --> 00:53:42.034
We are researchers doing
research in this reserve

1420
00:53:42.034 --> 00:53:42.754
We are researchers doing
research in this reserve

1421
00:53:42.874 --> 00:53:46.714
Sorry. we were driving and got lost

1422
00:53:46.954 --> 00:53:48.034
Then. our car got
stuck as you can see

1423
00:53:48.034 --> 00:53:49.954
Then. our car got
stuck as you can see

1424
00:53:50.074 --> 00:53:51.354
Don't we have towing equipment?

1425
00:53:51.474 --> 00:53:53.114
Give me the towing
equipment from the car

1426
00:53:53.474 --> 00:53:54.034
- Okay
- Thank you very much

1427
00:53:54.034 --> 00:53:55.674
- Okay
- Thank you very much

1428
00:53:55.794 --> 00:53:57.154
We will be a heavy burden on you

1429
00:53:57.274 --> 00:53:59.674
- Danger. Fathi!
- What is going on?

1430
00:53:59.794 --> 00:54:00.034
What is going on?

1431
00:54:00.034 --> 00:54:01.274
What is going on?

1432
00:54:03.034 --> 00:54:05.194
What is going on? What is going on?

1433
00:54:05.314 --> 00:54:06.034
Dad!

1434
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:06.634
Dad!

1435
00:54:09.394 --> 00:54:10.514
They're helping us. Dad!

1436
00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:12.034
- Danger. Fathi!
- Uncle Khamis!

1437
00:54:12.194 --> 00:54:14.434
- Stop. Dad!
- They're helping us. Dad!

1438
00:54:18.514 --> 00:54:19.954
Pull. Researcher!

1439
00:54:22.154 --> 00:54:24.034
Thank you very much

1440
00:54:24.154 --> 00:54:26.274
You really saved us

1441
00:54:26.394 --> 00:54:30.034
We are sorry for what my dad did
as he is an old man who loves women

1442
00:54:30.034 --> 00:54:30.234
We are sorry for what my dad did
as he is an old man who loves women

1443
00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:32.634
- He's very forgetful
- It's okay

1444
00:54:32.914 --> 00:54:35.154
- Where are you headed?
- To Siwa

1445
00:54:35.834 --> 00:54:36.034
My son is a genius. one of
the three smartest kids in Egypt

1446
00:54:36.034 --> 00:54:38.434
My son is a genius. one of
the three smartest kids in Egypt

1447
00:54:38.594 --> 00:54:39.794
Awesome. he's a genius

1448
00:54:39.914 --> 00:54:41.914
He's so clever. tell her
what three by three is

1449
00:54:42.034 --> 00:54:44.434
- Nine. Mom
- Great. God bless you

1450
00:54:44.674 --> 00:54:46.274
Did you come this way?

1451
00:54:46.714 --> 00:54:48.034
Why didn't you follow the highway?

1452
00:54:48.034 --> 00:54:48.314
Why didn't you follow the highway?

1453
00:54:48.434 --> 00:54:49.954
Because we stole this man's car...

1454
00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:51.354
It's hot

1455
00:54:51.794 --> 00:54:52.994
It's hot on the highway

1456
00:54:53.114 --> 00:54:54.034
You must wait till morning if you want
to keep driving through the reserve

1457
00:54:54.034 --> 00:54:56.034
You must wait till morning if you want
to keep driving through the reserve

1458
00:54:56.154 --> 00:54:57.354
so you can see the road ahead

1459
00:54:57.474 --> 00:54:59.634
So what happened to you
doesn't happen again. at least

1460
00:55:01.354 --> 00:55:02.354
I have an idea

1461
00:55:02.474 --> 00:55:03.994
Come to our camp

1462
00:55:04.114 --> 00:55:06.034
It's nearby and our colleagues
are there. instead of sitting alone

1463
00:55:06.034 --> 00:55:06.834
It's nearby and our colleagues
are there. instead of sitting alone

1464
00:55:07.434 --> 00:55:08.794
What's wrong with that. Fathi?

1465
00:55:09.034 --> 00:55:11.714
We'll have fun with them. instead
of sitting in this lonely place

1466
00:55:13.754 --> 00:55:15.274
As you wish. Safaa

1467
00:55:22.754 --> 00:55:24.034
"Believe me. if it were up to me"

1468
00:55:24.034 --> 00:55:25.434
"Believe me. if it were up to me"

1469
00:55:25.634 --> 00:55:28.154
"I would've carried you in my veins"

1470
00:55:28.314 --> 00:55:30.034
"I'd burn myself to light your way"

1471
00:55:30.034 --> 00:55:31.034
"I'd burn myself to light your way"

1472
00:55:31.154 --> 00:55:33.754
"I would've broken through
the barriers and paved your way"

1473
00:55:33.874 --> 00:55:36.034
"I would've collected the
goods of the world for you"

1474
00:55:36.034 --> 00:55:36.514
"I would've collected the
goods of the world for you"

1475
00:55:36.674 --> 00:55:39.274
"I would've been a star
that lights up your nights"

1476
00:55:39.394 --> 00:55:41.314
"I would've removed all
your worries with my palm"

1477
00:55:41.434 --> 00:55:42.034
"I would've hid you in my arms
and turned your fear into safety"

1478
00:55:42.034 --> 00:55:46.954
"I would've hid you in my arms
and turned your fear into safety"

1479
00:55:47.074 --> 00:55:48.034
"Humor us and lead us. Life"

1480
00:55:48.034 --> 00:55:52.474
"Humor us and lead us. Life"

1481
00:55:52.634 --> 00:55:54.034
"Humor us and lead us. Life"

1482
00:55:54.034 --> 00:55:57.874
"Humor us and lead us. Life"

1483
00:55:58.154 --> 00:56:00.034
"Humor us and lead us. Life"

1484
00:56:00.034 --> 00:56:03.514
"Humor us and lead us. Life"

1485
00:56:06.634 --> 00:56:08.154
What are you doing here. Researcher?

1486
00:56:08.274 --> 00:56:10.034
We are research medicinal herbs

1487
00:56:10.154 --> 00:56:12.034
Meaning. we conduct
studies and research on plants

1488
00:56:12.034 --> 00:56:12.314
Meaning. we conduct
studies and research on plants

1489
00:56:12.434 --> 00:56:14.874
to extract medicines and cures
for many diseases from them

1490
00:56:14.994 --> 00:56:16.834
Like the "Cat". "Border"
and "Grass Beans" herbs

1491
00:56:16.954 --> 00:56:18.034
So. you're geniuses like Zewail

1492
00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:21.034
We're not like him. of course. as
our specialty is different from his

1493
00:56:21.154 --> 00:56:24.034
If you're talking about the Nobel Prize
I hope Zakaria will win it like him

1494
00:56:24.034 --> 00:56:24.114
If you're talking about the Nobel Prize
I hope Zakaria will win it like him

1495
00:56:24.234 --> 00:56:25.514
Aren't you a genius. Zeko?

1496
00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:26.914
Very much so. Ma'am

1497
00:56:27.434 --> 00:56:29.834
How much is the monthly
salary of a genius. Researcher?

1498
00:56:29.954 --> 00:56:30.034
It is not money that matters. but
the value of what he gives people

1499
00:56:30.034 --> 00:56:32.714
It is not money that matters. but
the value of what he gives people

1500
00:56:32.834 --> 00:56:35.474
That's what I want you to realize from
now. Zakaria. don't think about money

1501
00:56:35.634 --> 00:56:36.034
Think of a way to benefit and help
people when you get a Nobel Prize

1502
00:56:36.034 --> 00:56:38.514
Think of a way to benefit and help
people when you get a Nobel Prize

1503
00:56:39.194 --> 00:56:40.514
Forget about that. Genius

1504
00:56:40.714 --> 00:56:42.034
We follow the "give me
my money first" policy

1505
00:56:42.034 --> 00:56:42.514
We follow the "give me
my money first" policy

1506
00:56:42.714 --> 00:56:43.994
It is our first priority

1507
00:56:44.114 --> 00:56:45.514
That's right. Uncle Issam

1508
00:56:47.794 --> 00:56:48.034
I have to go

1509
00:56:48.034 --> 00:56:49.194
I have to go

1510
00:56:55.874 --> 00:56:59.674
Do you think we'll see Zeko win
a Nobel Prize like Ahmed Zewail?

1511
00:56:59.794 --> 00:57:00.034
That would be great. Fathi

1512
00:57:00.034 --> 00:57:01.114
That would be great. Fathi

1513
00:57:01.754 --> 00:57:03.394
Schools will be named after him

1514
00:57:03.714 --> 00:57:04.994
Streets will be named after him

1515
00:57:05.314 --> 00:57:06.034
- Zakaria Fathi School
- Yes

1516
00:57:06.034 --> 00:57:07.394
- Zakaria Fathi School
- Yes

1517
00:57:08.434 --> 00:57:10.074
Just like the Ahmed Abdo School

1518
00:57:10.434 --> 00:57:11.994
I'd be driving the car

1519
00:57:12.474 --> 00:57:14.434
Then. someone stops me
and asks for an address

1520
00:57:15.154 --> 00:57:16.274
and I tell them. "Look"

1521
00:57:16.514 --> 00:57:18.034
"Walk to the end of
Zakaria Fathi Street"

1522
00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:18.714
"Walk to the end of
Zakaria Fathi Street"

1523
00:57:19.034 --> 00:57:20.354
"Then turn right"

1524
00:57:21.034 --> 00:57:22.274
I feel like I'm dreaming

1525
00:57:23.074 --> 00:57:24.034
I'm dreaming for the first time. Fathi

1526
00:57:24.034 --> 00:57:24.634
I'm dreaming for the first time. Fathi

1527
00:57:25.634 --> 00:57:27.514
We're really dreaming. Safaa

1528
00:57:28.394 --> 00:57:30.034
But we're dreaming of something that
we can see come true in front of us

1529
00:57:30.034 --> 00:57:31.314
But we're dreaming of something that
we can see come true in front of us

1530
00:57:32.514 --> 00:57:34.914
I think this is the
purpose of our lives

1531
00:57:35.034 --> 00:57:36.034
Yes

1532
00:57:36.234 --> 00:57:40.114
To dream. try. stumble
get up and keep trying

1533
00:57:43.314 --> 00:57:46.674
You must be wondering. "How did
the ignorant Safaa come up with this?"

1534
00:57:46.994 --> 00:57:48.034
Not at all

1535
00:57:48.034 --> 00:57:48.114
Not at all

1536
00:57:48.714 --> 00:57:51.074
You don't need to go to
school to say something like that

1537
00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.594
I think what we've been through
on the road since yesterday

1538
00:57:53.714 --> 00:57:54.034
is more than enough

1539
00:57:54.034 --> 00:57:54.754
is more than enough

1540
00:57:55.994 --> 00:57:57.154
Fathi

1541
00:57:57.954 --> 00:58:00.034
Promise me something
that our Lord will bear witness to

1542
00:58:00.034 --> 00:58:00.114
Promise me something
that our Lord will bear witness to

1543
00:58:00.354 --> 00:58:02.754
If you meet another woman someday

1544
00:58:03.194 --> 00:58:04.274
and marry her

1545
00:58:04.674 --> 00:58:06.034
Never forget what we
dreamed of for Zakaria. Fathi

1546
00:58:06.034 --> 00:58:06.914
Never forget what we
dreamed of for Zakaria. Fathi

1547
00:58:07.034 --> 00:58:08.394
How can I find a woman like you?

1548
00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:12.034
and how can I find a woman. who this
abaya suits as much as it suits you?

1549
00:58:12.034 --> 00:58:14.714
and how can I find a woman. who this
abaya suits as much as it suits you?

1550
00:58:15.314 --> 00:58:16.514
Are you serious. Fathi?

1551
00:58:16.674 --> 00:58:17.874
Of course. I'm serious

1552
00:58:18.154 --> 00:58:19.234
Listen

1553
00:58:19.914 --> 00:58:22.354
Remember the song we used
to sing when we were engaged?

1554
00:58:23.114 --> 00:58:24.034
"The pretty girl is in a good mood"

1555
00:58:24.034 --> 00:58:24.514
"The pretty girl is in a good mood"

1556
00:58:24.714 --> 00:58:26.074
"and the cool people are driving"

1557
00:58:26.194 --> 00:58:29.154
"Why are pretty people
under all this pressure?"

1558
00:58:29.274 --> 00:58:30.034
"Come a little closer"

1559
00:58:30.034 --> 00:58:30.434
"Come a little closer"

1560
00:58:30.594 --> 00:58:31.834
- Listen
- What's the matter?

1561
00:58:32.834 --> 00:58:35.834
I see there is an empty tent

1562
00:58:36.474 --> 00:58:38.514
I think it's missing one thing

1563
00:58:39.354 --> 00:58:40.674
It's missing a beautiful abaya

1564
00:58:40.794 --> 00:58:42.034
- What are you saying. Fathi?
- Listen to me

1565
00:58:42.034 --> 00:58:43.354
- What are you saying. Fathi?
- Listen to me

1566
00:58:43.594 --> 00:58:45.194
- In the desert?
- In the desert

1567
00:58:45.314 --> 00:58:47.234
- Among the researchers?
- Among the researchers

1568
00:58:47.354 --> 00:58:48.034
We haven't been together in
an empty place in a long time

1569
00:58:48.034 --> 00:58:49.714
We haven't been together in
an empty place in a long time

1570
00:58:50.034 --> 00:58:52.034
But I look bad and I'm not at my best

1571
00:58:52.154 --> 00:58:53.874
- That's what I want
- No. please

1572
00:58:53.994 --> 00:58:54.034
Come on. you look so beautiful

1573
00:58:54.034 --> 00:58:55.754
Come on. you look so beautiful

1574
00:58:55.874 --> 00:58:57.234
You are so beautiful. come on

1575
00:58:57.434 --> 00:58:58.914
- Come on
- Fathi

1576
00:58:59.034 --> 00:59:00.034
- Fathi
- What's the matter. Dad?

1577
00:59:00.034 --> 00:59:00.794
- Fathi
- What's the matter. Dad?

1578
00:59:01.234 --> 00:59:03.114
I remember where I put the letter

1579
00:59:04.194 --> 00:59:06.034
Go to bed quickly. Dad. please

1580
00:59:06.034 --> 00:59:06.194
Go to bed quickly. Dad. please

1581
00:59:07.594 --> 00:59:09.594
Quickly. quickly

1582
00:59:14.114 --> 00:59:15.874
Thank you very much

1583
00:59:15.994 --> 00:59:17.314
We don't know how to repay you

1584
00:59:17.434 --> 00:59:18.034
We didn't do anything
but take care of Zakaria

1585
00:59:18.034 --> 00:59:20.594
We didn't do anything
but take care of Zakaria

1586
00:59:20.714 --> 00:59:22.234
and don't go back to where you were

1587
00:59:22.354 --> 00:59:24.034
We'll take good care of Zakaria

1588
00:59:24.034 --> 00:59:24.074
We'll take good care of Zakaria

1589
00:59:25.074 --> 00:59:27.954
Give me your phone number and I'll
call you to tell you about Zakaria

1590
00:59:28.074 --> 00:59:30.034
Come on. Uncle Khamis. get in the car

1591
00:59:30.154 --> 00:59:32.034
Don't you need anything
before you leave?

1592
00:59:32.154 --> 00:59:33.194
Yes

1593
00:59:33.354 --> 00:59:36.034
If you offer us one of your tents
you'll have done us a great favor

1594
00:59:36.034 --> 00:59:36.874
If you offer us one of your tents
you'll have done us a great favor

1595
00:59:36.994 --> 00:59:38.754
- Fathi!
- The abaya

1596
00:59:38.954 --> 00:59:40.114
Your abaya. Safaa

1597
00:59:40.434 --> 00:59:42.034
Would you like to spend another night
here and forget about the contest?

1598
00:59:42.034 --> 00:59:43.594
Would you like to spend another night
here and forget about the contest?

1599
00:59:44.794 --> 00:59:46.274
Oh my God! Our son's future!

1600
00:59:46.394 --> 00:59:47.714
Come on. let's go

1601
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:48.034

1603
00:59:49.714 --> 00:59:51.354
- Bye. Zeko
- Bye. Researcher

1604
00:59:51.474 --> 00:59:52.874
Thank you very much

1605
01:00:07.594 --> 01:00:09.514
They turned out to be
good and wonderful people

1606
01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:12.034
Of course. I hope we see Zeko
like them and even better than them

1607
01:00:12.034 --> 01:00:13.834
Of course. I hope we see Zeko
like them and even better than them

1608
01:00:13.954 --> 01:00:15.514
I hope he becomes a researcher

1609
01:00:19.314 --> 01:00:21.514
What are these cars
that are parked there?

1610
01:00:21.674 --> 01:00:23.034
They must be researchers

1611
01:00:24.714 --> 01:00:25.874
Oh my God. Fathi!

1612
01:00:26.154 --> 01:00:27.474
Stop right there!

1613
01:00:27.634 --> 01:00:29.074
Will they kill us? Who are they?

1614
01:00:29.194 --> 01:00:30.034
- Don't shoot!
- Get out!

1615
01:00:30.034 --> 01:00:30.754
- Don't shoot!
- Get out!

1616
01:00:30.874 --> 01:00:32.034
I have a kid!

1617
01:00:32.154 --> 01:00:33.514
Don't shoot. I'll get them out!

1618
01:00:34.474 --> 01:00:35.474
- Get out
- What's wrong?

1619
01:00:35.634 --> 01:00:36.034
- Get out!
- They're getting out!

1620
01:00:36.034 --> 01:00:37.474
- Get out!
- They're getting out!

1621
01:00:38.194 --> 01:00:39.394
Get out!

1622
01:00:41.194 --> 01:00:42.034
Take it easy!

1623
01:00:42.034 --> 01:00:42.754
Take it easy!

1624
01:00:43.754 --> 01:00:44.954
Get down on the ground!

1625
01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.834
You'd point your gun at the face of a
man of your father's age. you bastard?

1626
01:00:47.954 --> 01:00:48.034
- Stop. Dad. stop
- Where's your dad? I'll scold him

1627
01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:51.154
- Stop. Dad. stop
- Where's your dad? I'll scold him

1628
01:00:51.274 --> 01:00:53.674
He's pointing his gun at the face
of a man his father's age. Fathi!

1629
01:00:53.794 --> 01:00:54.034
Please stop this. Uncle Khamis!

1630
01:00:54.034 --> 01:00:55.514
Please stop this. Uncle Khamis!

1631
01:00:55.674 --> 01:00:57.514
I'll slap him in the face
he might wake up

1632
01:00:57.674 --> 01:00:59.034
Slap me. Dad!

1633
01:00:59.154 --> 01:01:00.034
Lower your weapon. Atwa!

1634
01:01:00.034 --> 01:01:00.954
Lower your weapon. Atwa!

1635
01:01:07.514 --> 01:01:08.754
Man!

1636
01:01:08.914 --> 01:01:10.794
You must respect the hearse

1637
01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:18.034
What will he gain if
he wins the IQ contest?

1638
01:01:18.034 --> 01:01:18.794
What will he gain if
he wins the IQ contest?

1639
01:01:18.914 --> 01:01:21.034
He'll be as great as
the amazing Zewail

1640
01:01:21.194 --> 01:01:22.594
I will test his intelligence

1641
01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:24.034
- What's your name. boy?
- Zakaria

1642
01:01:24.034 --> 01:01:24.754
- What's your name. boy?
- Zakaria

1643
01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:26.754
Wow! He's brilliant!

1644
01:01:26.874 --> 01:01:28.354
Go to your mother. dear

1645
01:01:29.234 --> 01:01:30.034
What's wrong? Leave the kid alone
we're not here to discuss his future

1646
01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:32.034
What's wrong? Leave the kid alone
we're not here to discuss his future

1647
01:01:32.154 --> 01:01:33.834
We want to know what our fate is!

1648
01:01:33.954 --> 01:01:35.674
- Why are you yelling?
- I'm not yelling!

1649
01:01:35.794 --> 01:01:36.034
- Stop. Fathi
- Good evening. Ghandour

1650
01:01:36.034 --> 01:01:37.514
- Stop. Fathi
- Good evening. Ghandour

1651
01:01:37.874 --> 01:01:38.954
Is this a new regiment?

1652
01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:40.794
You have nothing to
do with them. sit down

1653
01:01:42.274 --> 01:01:43.394
What did you bring with you?

1654
01:01:43.514 --> 01:01:46.954
I brought you a super
original German piece

1655
01:01:47.234 --> 01:01:48.034
Yes

1656
01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:48.234
Yes

1657
01:01:48.474 --> 01:01:51.154
- How much do you want for it?
- It's 15.000

1658
01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:53.874
- Okay. I'll give you five
- Five what?

1659
01:01:54.114 --> 01:01:56.954
- It's an original German piece
- Did he kidnap us? I don't understand

1660
01:01:57.074 --> 01:01:58.114
Ask him

1661
01:01:58.634 --> 01:01:59.634
Did you say something?

1662
01:01:59.754 --> 01:02:00.034
- No. we're sorry
- No. we're sorry

1663
01:02:00.034 --> 01:02:01.154
- No. we're sorry
- No. we're sorry

1664
01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:04.434
- What do you think?
- Don't argue. I don't like that

1665
01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.874
I'll only give you five thousand

1666
01:02:05.994 --> 01:02:06.034
Will you take them or
should I bury you here?

1667
01:02:06.034 --> 01:02:07.914
Will you take them or
should I bury you here?

1668
01:02:08.034 --> 01:02:09.794
- Bury me here?
- Or here?

1669
01:02:09.914 --> 01:02:11.074
Okay then

1670
01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:14.594
This is 4500 pounds

1671
01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:17.074
I'll get the rest it
and give it to you

1672
01:02:17.674 --> 01:02:18.034
Go now

1673
01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:18.674
Go now

1674
01:02:18.794 --> 01:02:20.914
Wow. did you see how
much money is under his feet?

1675
01:02:21.034 --> 01:02:22.514
See how much criminals
make per month?

1676
01:02:22.714 --> 01:02:23.754
Shut up!

1677
01:02:25.794 --> 01:02:27.114
Where were we?

1678
01:02:27.354 --> 01:02:30.034
We were saying that you should decide
what exactly you want to do with us

1679
01:02:30.034 --> 01:02:30.634
We were saying that you should decide
what exactly you want to do with us

1680
01:02:30.754 --> 01:02:33.114
Do you want to take the car or not?
As we're on our way to a big event

1681
01:02:33.234 --> 01:02:36.034
I said that it is a hearse and has
its sanctity. meaning I don't need it

1682
01:02:36.034 --> 01:02:36.994
I said that it is a hearse and has
its sanctity. meaning I don't need it

1683
01:02:37.114 --> 01:02:39.514
Since it is a hearse. you don't
need it and has its sanctity

1684
01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:41.194
Why are you keeping
us here like prisoners?

1685
01:02:41.314 --> 01:02:42.034
- What do you want?
- Shut up. Safaa

1686
01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:43.194
- What do you want?
- Shut up. Safaa

1687
01:02:43.314 --> 01:02:44.634
Why are you yelling?

1688
01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:46.394
I'm not yelling!

1689
01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:48.034
Okay

1690
01:02:48.034 --> 01:02:48.234
Okay

1691
01:02:48.914 --> 01:02:50.514
Unscrew the car's four wheels. Atwa

1692
01:02:50.674 --> 01:02:52.274
- Wait. Atwa!
- Back off a little bit

1693
01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.034
- Back off. didn't you say it's sacred?
- Back off!

1694
01:02:54.034 --> 01:02:55.234
- Back off. didn't you say it's sacred?
- Back off!

1695
01:02:55.354 --> 01:02:57.394
Yes. the car is different
from the wheels

1696
01:02:57.914 --> 01:02:59.194
But how will they leave?

1697
01:02:59.314 --> 01:03:00.034
"They"? Aren't you with them?

1698
01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:00.794
"They"? Aren't you with them?

1699
01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:02.434
I want to make sure they'll be okay

1700
01:03:02.554 --> 01:03:03.634
Don't worry

1701
01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:06.034
Listen

1702
01:03:06.034 --> 01:03:07.394
Listen

1703
01:03:09.514 --> 01:03:10.514
What is his name?

1704
01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.034
Ghandour. Dad

1705
01:03:12.034 --> 01:03:12.234
Ghandour. Dad

1706
01:03:12.474 --> 01:03:14.154
Listen. Ghandour. my son

1707
01:03:14.834 --> 01:03:17.754
Death will come to us all

1708
01:03:18.514 --> 01:03:21.874
No human being will
escape this hearse

1709
01:03:23.274 --> 01:03:24.034
Human beings. my son...

1710
01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:24.874
Human beings. my son...

1711
01:03:27.634 --> 01:03:28.674
What bout them?

1712
01:03:30.194 --> 01:03:31.434
What was I saying to him?

1713
01:03:31.554 --> 01:03:34.234
You were saying that we'll all
ride in this hearse. Uncle Khamis

1714
01:03:34.354 --> 01:03:35.794
and no human being will escape it

1715
01:03:35.914 --> 01:03:36.034
Do you wish this for me. Safaa?

1716
01:03:36.034 --> 01:03:37.714
Do you wish this for me. Safaa?

1717
01:03:37.834 --> 01:03:39.914
That's enough. I got
what he's trying to say

1718
01:03:40.034 --> 01:03:41.914
So. if I take this car

1719
01:03:42.394 --> 01:03:45.194
I may not find a hearse to
take me to my grave when I die

1720
01:03:45.674 --> 01:03:47.074
What goes around comes around

1721
01:03:47.194 --> 01:03:48.034
Okay

1722
01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:48.194
Okay

1723
01:03:48.314 --> 01:03:49.434
I'm touched

1724
01:03:49.994 --> 01:03:51.474
- Atwa
- Yes. sir?

1725
01:03:51.634 --> 01:03:53.794
- Just take the spare tire
- At your command

1726
01:03:53.954 --> 01:03:54.034
What's the matter. sir?

1727
01:03:54.034 --> 01:03:55.394
What's the matter. sir?

1728
01:03:55.514 --> 01:03:57.354
Do you just have to steal anything?

1729
01:03:57.474 --> 01:03:58.514
Aren't I a thief?

1730
01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.034
Or did you meet me in a cafe?

1731
01:04:00.034 --> 01:04:00.434
Or did you meet me in a cafe?

1732
01:04:00.834 --> 01:04:02.714
Go now before I bury you here

1733
01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:04.274
Let's go. come on

1734
01:04:04.394 --> 01:04:05.834
Thank you very much

1735
01:04:06.154 --> 01:04:07.474
Thank you very much!

1736
01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:11.074
Listen. father of the genius

1737
01:04:11.674 --> 01:04:12.034
Don't go that way

1738
01:04:12.034 --> 01:04:12.954
Don't go that way

1739
01:04:13.154 --> 01:04:15.154
There is quicksand
that will swallow you up

1740
01:04:15.634 --> 01:04:17.114
Drive on the paved road

1741
01:04:17.314 --> 01:04:18.034
Goodbye

1742
01:04:18.034 --> 01:04:18.434
Goodbye

1743
01:04:36.954 --> 01:04:38.434
What are you doing?

1744
01:04:39.314 --> 01:04:41.034
It's because we'll
drive on the highway

1745
01:04:41.874 --> 01:04:42.034
This is no longer a hearse

1746
01:04:42.034 --> 01:04:43.674
This is no longer a hearse

1747
01:04:44.674 --> 01:04:47.074
- You're right. it's no longer a hearse
- Let's move

1748
01:04:47.194 --> 01:04:48.034
- Let's go
- Fathi

1749
01:04:48.034 --> 01:04:48.194
- Let's go
- Fathi

1750
01:04:48.434 --> 01:04:50.594
I think we should put the
casket on top of the car

1751
01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:53.874
So no one knows it's
a hearse if they search it

1752
01:04:53.994 --> 01:04:54.034
- Come on. Zakaria
- We don't need it anymore. Dad

1753
01:04:54.034 --> 01:04:56.274
- Come on. Zakaria
- We don't need it anymore. Dad

1754
01:04:56.394 --> 01:04:58.114
Let's go. come on

1755
01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.794
- Come on. come on
- Come on. Issam

1756
01:04:59.914 --> 01:05:00.034
Help your dad get into the car

1757
01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:01.194
Help your dad get into the car

1758
01:05:41.874 --> 01:05:42.034
Watch out. don't forget what we
agreed upon. if we encounter an ambush

1759
01:05:42.034 --> 01:05:44.674
Watch out. don't forget what we
agreed upon. if we encounter an ambush

1760
01:05:45.154 --> 01:05:48.034
Don't worry. Brother. we'd all
sacrifice ourselves for the genius

1761
01:05:48.034 --> 01:05:48.394
Don't worry. Brother. we'd all
sacrifice ourselves for the genius

1762
01:05:48.514 --> 01:05:50.314
Don't worry about it. Zakaria

1763
01:05:50.434 --> 01:05:52.474
I want you to focus to win

1764
01:05:54.354 --> 01:05:56.914
Don't worry about yourself
and keep your eyes on the road

1765
01:05:57.474 --> 01:05:59.794
I love you when you're
as confident as me

1766
01:06:00.154 --> 01:06:03.154
Bring us joy. Zakaria. for we
haven't been happy in a long time

1767
01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.834
Don't worry. I will win this contest

1768
01:06:05.954 --> 01:06:06.034
- God bless you!
- So. are you up to the challenge?

1769
01:06:06.034 --> 01:06:08.154
- God bless you!
- So. are you up to the challenge?

1770
01:06:08.394 --> 01:06:09.394
Yes

1771
01:06:09.514 --> 01:06:10.874
That's it

1772
01:06:13.394 --> 01:06:14.434
Who is it?

1773
01:06:14.714 --> 01:06:15.874
It's an unknown number

1774
01:06:17.714 --> 01:06:18.034
Hello?

1775
01:06:18.034 --> 01:06:18.794
Hello?

1776
01:06:20.034 --> 01:06:21.114
Its me

1777
01:06:22.714 --> 01:06:24.034
Hello. Mr. Director

1778
01:06:24.034 --> 01:06:24.634
Hello. Mr. Director

1779
01:06:25.074 --> 01:06:28.394
If you want to ask about the
contest. we are almost there

1780
01:06:33.234 --> 01:06:34.274
What?

1781
01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:39.634
What are you saying?

1782
01:06:46.914 --> 01:06:48.034
What's the matter. Fathi?

1783
01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:54.034
Fathi?

1784
01:06:54.034 --> 01:06:54.394
Fathi?

1785
01:06:59.634 --> 01:07:00.034
Stay here

1786
01:07:00.034 --> 01:07:00.834
Stay here

1787
01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:13.234
What's wrong?

1788
01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:18.034
Zakaria is not in the contest. Safaa

1789
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.154
Zakaria is not in the contest. Safaa

1790
01:07:20.914 --> 01:07:22.514
What do you mean
he's not in the contest?

1791
01:07:25.034 --> 01:07:26.754
Turns out it's someone
with a similar name

1792
01:07:27.594 --> 01:07:29.474
Another kid is supposed
to take Zakaria's place

1793
01:07:29.634 --> 01:07:30.034
and we got the letter by mistake

1794
01:07:30.034 --> 01:07:30.954
and we got the letter by mistake

1795
01:07:32.154 --> 01:07:33.314
No. Fathi

1796
01:07:33.594 --> 01:07:35.274
Stop it. I know your silly jokes

1797
01:07:35.434 --> 01:07:36.034
Please don't scare me

1798
01:07:36.034 --> 01:07:37.314
Please don't scare me

1799
01:07:37.914 --> 01:07:39.834
You can't joke about
such matters in particular

1800
01:07:42.794 --> 01:07:44.034
No. Fathi

1801
01:07:44.674 --> 01:07:47.194
My son Zakaria is smart and intelligent

1802
01:07:47.994 --> 01:07:48.034
They might be saying this to
disqualify him from the contest

1803
01:07:48.034 --> 01:07:51.154
They might be saying this to
disqualify him from the contest

1804
01:07:51.874 --> 01:07:53.714
You saw the mother of the kid we met

1805
01:07:53.874 --> 01:07:54.034
She must have the power
and nepotism plays a part in this

1806
01:07:54.034 --> 01:07:56.154
She must have the power
and nepotism plays a part in this

1807
01:07:56.834 --> 01:07:58.114
Isn't that right. Fathi?

1808
01:07:59.394 --> 01:08:00.034
They must've disqualified him
because we're poor and helpless

1809
01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:02.434
They must've disqualified him
because we're poor and helpless

1810
01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:03.874
They're being unfair to our son

1811
01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.034
No. please. Fathi

1812
01:08:06.034 --> 01:08:06.754
No. please. Fathi

1813
01:08:07.714 --> 01:08:09.354
Please don't say this to me

1814
01:08:10.114 --> 01:08:12.034
We don't want our son to be like us

1815
01:08:12.514 --> 01:08:14.474
We finally had a dream. Fathi

1816
01:08:15.354 --> 01:08:16.714
Please. Fathi

1817
01:08:17.274 --> 01:08:18.034
Please. please. Fathi

1818
01:08:18.034 --> 01:08:19.714
Please. please. Fathi

1819
01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:21.354
Please. Fathi

1820
01:08:21.834 --> 01:08:23.714
Let's go for the love of God

1821
01:08:24.154 --> 01:08:26.674
Our son. our son. Fathi

1822
01:08:35.874 --> 01:08:36.034
We'll go. right? Will we go?

1823
01:08:36.034 --> 01:08:38.114
We'll go. right? Will we go?

1824
01:08:39.034 --> 01:08:40.154
Will we go?

1825
01:08:43.474 --> 01:08:44.794
Get up. let's keep going

1826
01:08:45.794 --> 01:08:47.354
God will honor us

1827
01:09:20.114 --> 01:09:21.514
There's an ambush there

1828
01:09:21.914 --> 01:09:23.154
Don't forget our agreement

1829
01:09:23.514 --> 01:09:24.034
- Sing. Issam!
- Come on. Zakaria

1830
01:09:24.034 --> 01:09:25.634
- Sing. Issam!
- Come on. Zakaria

1831
01:09:25.754 --> 01:09:27.994
"At Om Farouk's house"

1832
01:09:28.114 --> 01:09:30.034
"The tree has grown plums"

1833
01:09:30.354 --> 01:09:33.274
"And I love a crazy
man in a plastic scarf"

1834
01:09:33.394 --> 01:09:35.354
"Flirt. our groom
with a plastic scarf"

1835
01:09:35.474 --> 01:09:36.034
"Flirt. our groom
with a plastic scarf"

1836
01:09:36.034 --> 01:09:37.674
"Flirt. our groom
with a plastic scarf"

1837
01:09:37.794 --> 01:09:39.914
"Flirt. our groom
with a plastic scarf"

1838
01:09:40.034 --> 01:09:42.034
- "Flirt. our groom..."
- Silence. silence!

1839
01:09:42.034 --> 01:09:42.234
- "Flirt. our groom..."
- Silence. silence!

1840
01:09:42.514 --> 01:09:43.674
Good day. sir

Excuse us. we're coming from the
capital to get my brother engaged

1842

1844

Where are the car
registration papers?

1854
01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:06.034
I found them and put
them on top of the TV

1855
01:10:06.034 --> 01:10:06.114
I found them and put
them on top of the TV

1856
01:10:06.354 --> 01:10:07.474
On top of the TV?

1857
01:10:07.634 --> 01:10:09.194
What good will they
do me on top of the TV?

1858
01:10:09.314 --> 01:10:10.834
I thought you'd see
them and take them

1859
01:10:10.954 --> 01:10:12.034
I didn't see them. Safaa!
What do I do now?

1860
01:10:12.034 --> 01:10:13.114
I didn't see them. Safaa!
What do I do now?

1861
01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:14.754
- Damn me. Fathi
- Damn you?

1862
01:10:14.874 --> 01:10:16.674
What do I say to the good
man who wants to see them?

1863
01:10:16.794 --> 01:10:18.034
I'll divorce you after we
get back home. Safaa!

1864
01:10:18.034 --> 01:10:18.834
I'll divorce you after we
get back home. Safaa!

1865
01:10:18.954 --> 01:10:21.034
- Oh my God. Fathi!
- I don't want you anymore!

1866
01:10:21.154 --> 01:10:22.954
Please. Officer. don't ruin my joy

1867
01:10:23.074 --> 01:10:24.034
Calm down. it's not that big of a deal

1868
01:10:24.034 --> 01:10:25.714
Calm down. it's not that big of a deal

01:10:25.834 --> 01:10:27.114
Get out now

1873
01:10:31.274 --> 01:10:32.674
Come and park this car on the side

01:10:32.794 --> 01:10:33.954

- Won't you let us be happy. sir?

1875
01:10:34.074 --> 01:10:35.314

- What is it. sir?
- Come here

1880
01:10:39.514 --> 01:10:41.314
This car was reported stolen

1881
01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:42.034

1882
01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:43.474

Go this way. come on

I swear we didn't steal it. sir

1885
01:10:48.034 --> 01:10:49.314
I swear we didn't steal it. sir

1886
01:10:49.434 --> 01:10:51.194
He's been working for
the man for a long time

1887
01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:53.114
We'll return it to him and
sort it out when we get back

1888
01:10:53.234 --> 01:10:54.034
Please don't waste
our son's future. sir

Please don't waste
our son's future. sir

1890
01:10:54.954 --> 01:10:56.514
We went through a lot to get here

1891
01:10:56.674 --> 01:10:59.834
What do you want me to do? How can
I let you pass. when you stole a car?

1892
01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:00.034
Let us go to the contest and I'll go
with you wherever you want even to hell

1893
01:11:00.034 --> 01:11:02.914
Let us go to the contest and I'll go
with you wherever you want even to hell

1894
01:11:03.034 --> 01:11:04.874
- That's not possible
- "Do you copy?"

1895
01:11:05.314 --> 01:11:06.034
Yes. sir. I hear you

1896
01:11:06.034 --> 01:11:06.994
Yes. sir. I hear you

I'll stay with you. and we'll stay
together like we came together

1903
01:11:18.714 --> 01:11:20.114
Don't you see the situation. Safaa?

1904
01:11:21.474 --> 01:11:22.954
I'll take the fall. Fathi

1905
01:11:23.954 --> 01:11:24.034
What are you saying? The
punishment is going to prison. Issam

1906
01:11:24.034 --> 01:11:25.674
What are you saying? The
punishment is going to prison. Issam

1907
01:11:25.794 --> 01:11:27.754
It doesn't matter. keep
going and don't mind me

1908
01:11:27.874 --> 01:11:29.634
No. it's not your fault

1909
01:11:29.754 --> 01:11:30.034
Say something. Safaa

1910
01:11:30.034 --> 01:11:31.274
Say something. Safaa

1911
01:11:31.434 --> 01:11:33.194
You should be with Zakaria

1912
01:11:33.314 --> 01:11:36.034
He can't enter the contest knowing
his dad is in jail. how will he focus?

1913
01:11:36.034 --> 01:11:36.474
He can't enter the contest knowing
his dad is in jail. how will he focus?

1914
01:11:37.114 --> 01:11:39.154
Don't worry about me. your
brother knows what to do

1915
01:11:41.314 --> 01:11:42.034
What is it? Why are you
looking at me like that?

1916
01:11:42.034 --> 01:11:42.674
What is it? Why are you
looking at me like that?

1917
01:11:42.794 --> 01:11:45.074
This is my first time
witnessing your chivalry

1918
01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:46.434
You are right about that

1919
01:11:47.074 --> 01:11:48.034
I've always been useless

1920
01:11:48.034 --> 01:11:49.114
I've always been useless

1921
01:11:49.954 --> 01:11:51.194
I tried to be a decent
human being. but failed

1922
01:11:51.314 --> 01:11:53.354
I tried to sing. but my
voice was as ugly as my face

1923
01:11:53.514 --> 01:11:54.034
Maybe God created me to help this kid

1924
01:11:54.034 --> 01:11:56.074
Maybe God created me to help this kid

1925
01:11:58.074 --> 01:11:59.194
Listen. sir

1926
01:12:01.114 --> 01:12:03.994
I'm the one who stole the car. sir
it's not any of those people's fault

1927
01:12:04.674 --> 01:12:05.994
So. will you take responsibility?

1928
01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:09.314
We're a family. sir. handcuff
me and get it over with please

01:12:09.634 --> 01:12:10.874
Put him in handcuffs

We'll meet again. Issam

1931
01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.074
We'll meet again. Brother

1932
01:12:16.194 --> 01:12:17.514
It's not like I'm going to Iraq

1933
01:12:17.714 --> 01:12:18.034
Wait eight years and you'll
find me in front of you. okay?

1934
01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:20.394
Wait eight years and you'll
find me in front of you. okay?

Listen. Genius!

1938
01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.674

- Nine

1939
01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:30.034
I'm sure you'll be okay

01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:30.074
I'm sure you'll be okay

1941

Focus on the contest. boy

1942
01:12:33.194 --> 01:12:34.234
Come on. Dad

1943
01:12:34.754 --> 01:12:36.034
Isn't Issam coming with us?

1944
01:12:36.034 --> 01:12:36.474
Isn't Issam coming with us?

1945
01:12:37.314 --> 01:12:38.474
He's not. Dad

1946
01:13:16.594 --> 01:13:18.034
Why are you making us walk. Son?

1947
01:13:18.034 --> 01:13:19.114
Why are you making us walk. Son?

1948
01:13:19.754 --> 01:13:21.834
You're making us climb
and descend from mountains

1949
01:13:21.954 --> 01:13:24.034
and walk on sand. asphalt and dirt!

1950
01:13:24.034 --> 01:13:25.074
and walk on sand. asphalt and dirt!

1951
01:13:25.714 --> 01:13:27.234
Where are we going?

1952
01:13:27.594 --> 01:13:29.194
We're going for a walk. Dad

1953
01:13:30.434 --> 01:13:32.074
Let's ride some vehicle

1954
01:13:32.194 --> 01:13:33.194
I'm tired!

1955
01:13:33.514 --> 01:13:34.834
We're sorry. Uncle

1956
01:13:35.194 --> 01:13:36.034
We don't have money to rent a vehicle

1957
01:13:36.034 --> 01:13:36.874
We don't have money to rent a vehicle

1958
01:13:36.994 --> 01:13:38.514
We're taking a shortcut like this. Dad

1959
01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:39.834
A shortcut?

1960
01:13:40.954 --> 01:13:42.034
How much do we have left?

1961
01:13:42.034 --> 01:13:42.354
How much do we have left?

1962
01:13:43.354 --> 01:13:44.514
Six kilometers

1963
01:13:44.674 --> 01:13:46.154
Six kilometers?

1964
01:13:46.394 --> 01:13:47.834
Six kilometers?

1965
01:13:48.354 --> 01:13:50.434
No! This is unbearable!

1966
01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:52.274
This is unbearable!

1967
01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:54.034

1969
01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:55.914
What's this madness. Uncle Khamis?

1970
01:13:56.034 --> 01:13:59.154
Are you crazy? Do you want
to die and get me in trouble?

1971
01:13:59.274 --> 01:14:00.034
I wanted something
completely different

What do you want?

1974
01:14:04.634 --> 01:14:06.034
Why did I stand in front of the car?

1975
01:14:06.034 --> 01:14:06.434
Why did I stand in front of the car?

1976
01:14:08.514 --> 01:14:10.194
Can you drive us on your way. sir?

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:08.474
"Big enough for me"

2028
01:16:08.874 --> 01:16:12.034
"I'm sure things will
get better for me"

2029
01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.034
"I'm sure things will
get better for me"

2030
01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:18.034
"I can see hope on your face"

2031
01:16:18.034 --> 01:16:19.114
"I can see hope on your face"

2032
01:16:19.234 --> 01:16:21.954
"We belong somewhere else"

2033
01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:24.034
"Not with everyone else"

2034
01:16:24.034 --> 01:16:24.434
"Not with everyone else"

2035
01:16:24.554 --> 01:16:25.834
Where are you going?

2036
01:16:26.034 --> 01:16:28.794
We're the parents of Zakaria Fathi
who's participating in the contest

2037
01:16:28.914 --> 01:16:30.034
How could you arrived so quickly?

2038
01:16:30.034 --> 01:16:30.634
How could you arrived so quickly?

2039
01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.074
You just found out about it today

2040
01:16:32.194 --> 01:16:34.834
We were nearby. on
a vacation in Matrouh

2041
01:16:34.954 --> 01:16:36.034
Okay. we're going to take Zakaria
now. as the ceremony is about to start

2042
01:16:36.034 --> 01:16:37.834
Okay. we're going to take Zakaria

2043
01:16:37.954 --> 01:16:40.154
Wait here. and I'll send

- Well. thank you
- Let's go. Zakaria

2046
01:16:44.794 --> 01:16:47.194
I can't believe they
took Zakaria so easily

2047
01:16:47.634 --> 01:16:48.034
They thought it was
the other kid. Safaa

2048
01:16:48.034 --> 01:16:49.434
They thought it was
the other kid. Safaa

2049
01:16:49.594 --> 01:16:51.154
Is there really another kid?

2050
01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.034
It doesn't matter. Safaa. what matters
is that Zakaria entered the contest

2051
01:16:54.034 --> 01:16:55.194
It doesn't matter. Safaa. what matters
is that Zakaria entered the contest

2052
01:16:55.634 --> 01:16:57.034
I hope he wins

2053
01:17:00.834 --> 01:17:02.954

2054
01:17:03.234 --> 01:17:05.274
What's the matter. Ahmed?
Is there another disaster?

01:17:05.394 --> 01:17:06.034
Not at all. we're ready

01:17:06.034 --> 01:17:07.674
Not at all. we're ready

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:10.354
Even Zakaria Fathi is here. we
dressed him up and he went on stage

2058
01:17:10.474 --> 01:17:12.034
- Who is Zakaria Fathi?
- The third contestant

2059
01:17:12.034 --> 01:17:12.634
- Who is Zakaria Fathi?
- The third contestant

2060
01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:15.434

Your show is honestly the only

01:17:42.034 --> 01:17:45.154
Your show is honestly the only
thing that brings us together

2077
01:17:45.354 --> 01:17:47.514
Thank God there's something
that brings you together

2078
01:17:47.674 --> 01:17:48.034
- Who are you?
- Are you in a relationship. Ma'am?

2079
01:17:48.034 --> 01:17:50.114
- Who are you?
- Are you in a relationship. Ma'am?

2080
01:17:50.234 --> 01:17:51.354
Shut up. Uncle Khamis!

2081
01:17:51.474 --> 01:17:53.634
- What is this?
- We're Zakaria Fathi's parents

2082
01:17:53.754 --> 01:17:54.034
Okay. and who is Zakaria Fathi?

2083
01:17:54.034 --> 01:17:55.434
Okay. and who is Zakaria Fathi?

2084
01:17:55.554 --> 01:17:57.274
The one who got
the letter by mistake?

2085
01:17:57.674 --> 01:17:58.834
We love you so much

2086
01:17:58.954 --> 01:18:00.034
I swear. we love you so much

2087
01:18:00.034 --> 01:18:00.514
I swear. we love you so much

2088
01:18:00.674 --> 01:18:02.434
I love you so much as well. dear

2089
01:18:02.554 --> 01:18:05.234
But this means that your son
entered the contest by mistake

2090
01:18:05.354 --> 01:18:06.034
Yes. what does this mean. Ma'am?

2091
01:18:06.034 --> 01:18:06.794
Yes. what does this mean. Ma'am?

2092
01:18:06.914 --> 01:18:09.794
That he has to leave before the
contest starts and we have a scandal

2093
01:18:09.914 --> 01:18:12.034
What does this mean? Do
you think you can toy with us?

2094
01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.754
One minute our son is in the contest
The next. he's not. what's this?

2095
01:18:14.874 --> 01:18:17.794
Didn't you just say you love me
Why did you change your tone now?

2096
01:18:17.914 --> 01:18:18.034
I still love you

2097
01:18:18.034 --> 01:18:19.074
I still love you

2098
01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.354
But I know how nepotism works

2099
01:18:20.474 --> 01:18:22.514
You want to get rid of him to
give the prize to another kid

2100
01:18:22.674 --> 01:18:24.034
Yes. we know and understand
these tricks very well

2101
01:18:24.034 --> 01:18:24.674
Yes. we know and understand
these tricks very well

2102
01:18:24.794 --> 01:18:26.994
Just so you know. Ma'am
We can make a scene here

2103
01:18:27.114 --> 01:18:29.354
Why would you do that. Son?
There is no nepotism here

2104
01:18:29.474 --> 01:18:30.034
But the the name of the kid
who got into the contest

2105
01:18:30.034 --> 01:18:31.634
But the the name of the kid
who got into the contest

2106
01:18:31.754 --> 01:18:33.434
and your son's name
were really similar

2107
01:18:33.554 --> 01:18:35.354
That's not our fault

2108
01:18:35.474 --> 01:18:36.034
We received a letter saying
that our son got into this contest

2109
01:18:36.034 --> 01:18:38.074
We received a letter saying
that our son got into this contest

2110
01:18:38.194 --> 01:18:40.714
So. you're the ones who
made the mistake. not us

2111
01:18:40.834 --> 01:18:42.034
These contests involve
tests that require

2112
01:18:42.034 --> 01:18:42.634
These contests involve
tests that require

2113
01:18:42.754 --> 01:18:45.114
a sharp mind and
high level of intelligence

2114
01:18:45.234 --> 01:18:47.634
Questions that we adults can't solve

2115
01:18:47.754 --> 01:18:48.034
let alone a normal kid like yours

2116
01:18:48.034 --> 01:18:50.194
let alone a normal kid like yours

2117
01:18:50.314 --> 01:18:51.354
No

2118
01:18:51.474 --> 01:18:52.954
My son is a genius. he's not normal

2119
01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:54.034
None of the kids inside
are better than him

2120
01:18:54.034 --> 01:18:54.794
None of the kids inside
are better than him

2121
01:18:54.914 --> 01:18:57.914
Only God knows what we went through
to make it in time for this contest

2122
01:18:58.314 --> 01:18:59.954
Besides. the boy has
already entered the contest

2123
01:19:00.074 --> 01:19:01.594
You have nothing to
lose by leaving him there

2124
01:19:01.714 --> 01:19:02.714
It'll be good if he can
solve the questions

2125
01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:04.754
Otherwise. congratulations
to whoever wins

2126
01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.034
But please. Ma'am

2127
01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:06.114
But please. Ma'am

2128
01:19:06.234 --> 01:19:07.514
Please don't break
my son's heart

2129
01:19:07.674 --> 01:19:11.354
I am afraid that the kid won't
be able to do well and feel inferior

2130
01:19:11.474 --> 01:19:12.034
He won't recover from this
shock as long as he lives

2131
01:19:12.034 --> 01:19:13.114
He won't recover from this
shock as long as he lives

2132
01:19:13.234 --> 01:19:16.354
If you're worried about
us. we have nothing to lose

2133
01:19:16.594 --> 01:19:18.034
But please don't break the boy's heart

2134
01:19:18.034 --> 01:19:18.514
But please don't break the boy's heart

2135
01:19:18.714 --> 01:19:19.994

"Well done. correct answer!"

2192
01:21:07.954 --> 01:21:09.314
You bastard!

2193
01:21:09.714 --> 01:21:11.714
Pardon me? What did you say?

2194
01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:12.034
How much did you pay. lady?

2195
01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:13.074
How much did you pay. lady?

2196
01:21:13.194 --> 01:21:14.514
"Second question"

2197
01:21:14.714 --> 01:21:17.354
There's no way I'd sit next to you
your bad smell alone is repulsive

2198
01:21:17.474 --> 01:21:18.034
Of course. you wouldn't
dare look me in the eye

2199
01:21:18.034 --> 01:21:19.354
Of course. you wouldn't
dare look me in the eye

2200
01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:21.074
Why are you complaining
about our smell?

2201
01:21:21.194 --> 01:21:22.914
Is the kid faster than a calculator?

2202
01:21:23.034 --> 01:21:24.034
- Because he's good
- Good?

2203
01:21:24.034 --> 01:21:25.234
- Because he's good
- Good?

2204
01:21:25.354 --> 01:21:27.194
"Dalia will answer first
what's your answer?"

2205
01:21:27.314 --> 01:21:30.034
"1.87973"

2206
01:21:30.034 --> 01:21:30.754
"1.87973"

2207
01:21:30.874 --> 01:21:32.314
"Wonderful. wonderful!"

2208
01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:33.874
"The answer is correct!"

2209
01:21:37.594 --> 01:21:40.234
- "Wonderful. wonderful!"
- Weren't the answers leaked. Fathi?

2210
01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:42.034
No. they weren't. Safaa

2211
01:21:42.034 --> 01:21:42.074
No. they weren't. Safaa

2212
01:21:42.194 --> 01:21:43.994
- Look at Zakaria and who's next to him
- "What's..."

2213
01:21:44.114 --> 01:21:47.914
- And you'll understand
- "26.565"

2214
01:21:48.314 --> 01:21:52.874
"by 4128?"

2215
01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:00.034
- "109.660.320"
- "Well done!"

2216
01:22:00.034 --> 01:22:03.874
- "109.660.320"
- "Well done!"

2217
01:22:04.034 --> 01:22:06.034
"Correct answer! Amazing!"

2218
01:22:06.034 --> 01:22:06.194
"Correct answer! Amazing!"

2219
01:22:08.314 --> 01:22:10.674
"Just like a calculator. well done!"

2220
01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:17.754
Safaa

2221
01:22:24.154 --> 01:22:26.194
I know and appreciate
how sad you are

2222
01:22:27.274 --> 01:22:28.914
because I'm just as sad as you are

2223
01:22:31.114 --> 01:22:32.594
I had a dream. Fathi

2224
01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.914
and got my hopes way up

2225
01:22:36.154 --> 01:22:37.834
I know. but I was sure from the start

2226
01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.434
that Zakaria wasn't
a genius as we were told

2227
01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.034
Our son Zakaria is just like us. Safaa

2228
01:22:42.034 --> 01:22:43.354
Our son Zakaria is just like us. Safaa

2229
01:22:43.474 --> 01:22:44.514
He's normal

2230
01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.394
But we're the ones
who yearned to dream

2231
01:22:48.914 --> 01:22:51.834
and wanted to have one
good thing in our lives

2232
01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:54.034
So. we brought our son and
humiliated him in front of everyone

2233
01:22:54.034 --> 01:22:55.874
So. we brought our son and
humiliated him in front of everyone

2234
01:22:57.234 --> 01:22:58.274
No. no

2235
01:22:58.474 --> 01:22:59.514
No. Safaa

2236
01:23:00.394 --> 01:23:02.754
We did it all for the baby

2237
01:23:03.994 --> 01:23:06.034
Please God. forgive me

2238
01:23:06.034 --> 01:23:06.754
Please God. forgive me

2239
01:23:06.914 --> 01:23:08.354
Please God. forgive me

2240
01:23:10.274 --> 01:23:11.794
Fortunately. we are okay

2241
01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.234
Come on

2242
01:23:14.794 --> 01:23:16.994
Let's go so our son doesn't
feel like we left him alone

2243
01:23:17.194 --> 01:23:18.034
"The contest got heated. people"

2244
01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:19.034
"The contest got heated. people"

2245
01:23:19.154 --> 01:23:20.794
"The score so far is..."

2246
01:23:20.914 --> 01:23:23.834
"15 points for Mazen
and 15 points for Dalia"

2247
01:23:23.954 --> 01:23:24.034
"As for Zakaria Fathi's score"

2248
01:23:24.034 --> 01:23:25.514
"As for Zakaria Fathi's score"

2249
01:23:25.794 --> 01:23:26.834
"It's zero"

2250
01:23:27.954 --> 01:23:29.474
"The seventh question"

2251
01:23:30.874 --> 01:23:35.394
"What's the square root of 543?"

2252
01:23:37.194 --> 01:23:40.914
"Finally! Zakaria Fathi
finally pressed the button!"

2253
01:23:41.034 --> 01:23:42.034
"Tell us. Zakaria. what is it?"

2254
01:23:42.034 --> 01:23:42.954
"Tell us. Zakaria. what is it?"

2255
01:23:43.074 --> 01:23:45.234
"Honestly. I can't
answer these questions"

2256
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:46.914
"But I can do other things"

2257
01:23:47.034 --> 01:23:48.034
- "What will you do. boy?"
- "I'll sing"

2258
01:23:48.034 --> 01:23:48.874
- "What will you do. boy?"
- "I'll sing"

2259
01:23:48.994 --> 01:23:51.514
"How will sing? This show
has nothing to do with singing"

2260
01:23:51.674 --> 01:23:52.714
Let him sing!

2261
01:23:52.834 --> 01:23:54.034
Sing Zakaria. sing. dear

2262
01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:54.154
Sing Zakaria. sing. dear

2263
01:23:54.274 --> 01:23:56.074
- "What?"
- What's wrong with you. sir?

2264
01:23:56.194 --> 01:23:57.834
Give the child a chance
and let him sing

2265
01:23:57.954 --> 01:23:59.314
"This is a quiz show!"

2266
01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:00.034
Sing your heart out
Zakaria. don't mind them

2267
01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:01.274
Sing your heart out
Zakaria. don't mind them

2268
01:24:01.394 --> 01:24:02.954
Please. Son

2269
01:24:03.634 --> 01:24:05.874
I don't know why I'm here
or what brought me here

2270
01:24:05.994 --> 01:24:06.034
But all I can say is we
are a miserable family

2271
01:24:06.034 --> 01:24:09.114
But all I can say is we
are a miserable family

2272
01:24:09.234 --> 01:24:10.634
and we want to have some fun

2273
01:24:11.034 --> 01:24:12.034
Let the boy sing

2274
01:24:12.154 --> 01:24:13.714
Come on. let him sing

2275
01:24:13.834 --> 01:24:14.874
Sing. sing. boy!

2276
01:24:14.994 --> 01:24:16.954
- Sing. Zakaria. don't mind them
- "Oh. night. oh night"

2277
01:24:17.074 --> 01:24:18.034
- Sing

2278
01:24:18.034 --> 01:24:18.434
- Sing
- Sing

2279
01:24:18.594 --> 01:24:21.794
- "Oh. night. oh night"
- "Stop singing! Stop!"

2280
01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:24.034
- What's wrong? What are you doing?
- What do you want? What do you want?

2281
01:24:24.034 --> 01:24:25.274
- What's wrong? What are you doing?
- What do you want? What do you want?

2282
01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.834
That's what he wanted
but we didn't get it

2283
01:24:28.674 --> 01:24:30.034
"Oh night"

2284
01:24:30.034 --> 01:24:30.914
"Oh night"

2285
01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:33.434
"The pretty girl is in a good mood"

2286
01:24:34.594 --> 01:24:36.034
"and the cool people are driving"

2287
01:24:36.034 --> 01:24:37.154
"and the cool people are driving"

2288
01:24:38.394 --> 01:24:41.994
"Why are pretty people
under all this pressure?"

2289
01:24:42.194 --> 01:24:44.474
"Come a little closer"

2290
01:24:45.874 --> 01:24:48.034
"Come a little closer"

2291
01:24:48.034 --> 01:24:48.114
"Come a little closer"

2292
01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:53.594
"Now that you're close to
me. please stay by my side"

2297
01:24:59.714 --> 01:25:00.034
"under all this pressure?"

2298
01:25:00.034 --> 01:25:00.994
"under all this pressure?"

"Now that you're close to
me. please stay by my side"

2302
01:25:08.194 --> 01:25:09.914
"Is that the sound of the drum?"

Let the boy sing!

2309
01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:22.034
Stay away! Come here!

2310
01:25:22.154 --> 01:25:23.834
Watch out for your abaya. Safaa!

2311
01:25:27.754 --> 01:25:29.274
"Some people deserve to be spoiled"

2312
01:25:29.394 --> 01:25:30.034
- "That's who they are"

01:25:36.034 --> 01:25:38.754
"The beauty of her eyelashes
alone makes here presence strong"

2317

"She hasn't taken
her rightful place yet"

2318

"Is that the sound of the drum?"

2319

"It's my heartbeat"

2320
01:25:45.634 --> 01:25:47.714

What happened. father of the genius?

2346
01:26:35.474 --> 01:26:36.034
Didn't I tell you we'd meet again?

2347
01:26:36.034 --> 01:26:37.154
Didn't I tell you we'd meet again?

2348
01:26:37.674 --> 01:26:39.314
Did the genius get into trouble?

Look over there

2355
01:27:16.034 --> 01:27:17.954
How did you feel
after getting on stage

2356
01:27:18.074 --> 01:27:19.914
and singing in front of
such a large audience?

2357
01:27:20.074 --> 01:27:22.194
I felt so happy and
wanted to sing again

2358
01:27:22.874 --> 01:27:24.034
Are you happy that you
got into the contest with us?

2359
01:27:24.034 --> 01:27:24.914
Are you happy that you
