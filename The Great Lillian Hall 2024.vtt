Yeah. well.
when I lived in Jersey.

173
00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:57.303
my neighbors had chimpanzees.

174
00:09:57.303 --> 00:09:58.838
Why am I not surprised?

175
00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:01.207
It was a very nice
neighborhood in Passaic.

176
00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:02.845
There is no such thing.

177
00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:05.244
Sweetheart.

178
00:10:05.244 --> 00:10:08.647
I am so. so sorry. but... Well.

179
00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:10.449
- I have rehearsal this morning.
- Yeah. yeah.

180
00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:11.683
Yeah. yeah. well. another time.

181
00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:14.790

- MARGARET: So. Mom?
- LILLIAN: Huh?

184
00:10:19.058 --> 00:10:20.827
- Before I go. I took Finn...
- (PHONE RINGING)

185
00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:23.162
...to the orthodontist
this week.

186
00:10:23.162 --> 00:10:25.664
- I didn't even want him to go.
- Edith! Phone!

187
00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:27.800
Kept telling him about
all the brilliant writers

188
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.968
with crooked teeth.

189
00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:30.935
Lillian Hall's residence.
Yes. how are you?

190
00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:32.705
Anyway. according
to this orthodontist.
he has. uh...

191
00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:34.807
Well. you're in luck.
She's just. uh...

192
00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:36.108
She's just finishing up
a meeting.

193
00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:37.677
- And. uh...
- ...malocclusion problem.

194
00:10:37.677 --> 00:10:39.378
EDITH: Sorry about the emails.

195
00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:42.014
- Oh. that doesn't sound good.
- EDITH: Our internet
was down for a while.

196
00:10:42.014 --> 00:10:44.783
- EDITH: Is that...
- Uh. Edith. who is it?

197
00:10:44.783 --> 00:10:47.419
The problem is that between
the extractions and the braces.

198
00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:49.021
it's gonna cost
like eight grand.

199
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:51.358
- EDITH: Alright. hold on. honey.
- Whoa. wow. Huh.

200
00:10:51.358 --> 00:10:53.192
EDITH: It's Bill Long.

201
00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:54.360
LILLIAN: Bill?

202
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.596
American Theatre Wing?
Lifetime Achievement Award?

203
00:10:57.596 --> 00:10:59.899
- LILLIAN: Oh.
- Oh. oh my God. Mom! Really?

204
00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.968
How old do they think I am?

205
00:11:01.968 --> 00:11:03.169
By now. 104.

206
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:06.038
Just tell him
I... I... I can't talk now.

207
00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:07.906
- EDITH: No. Lillian. Lillian.
- That we are in rehearsal.

208
00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:10.977
- And I've got. I'm doing a play.
- EDITH: You tell him.
I've told him multiple times.

209
00:11:10.977 --> 00:11:12.278
- LILLIAN: No. come on!
- EDITH: Lillian.

210
00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:13.813
You're acting like a child.

211
00:11:13.813 --> 00:11:15.248
- I don't care.
- Argh!

212
00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:17.250
She's finished with the meeting.
Bill. you have perfect timing.

213
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.722
Oh. she's dying to talk to you.
Here she is.

214
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.690
LILLIAN: Bill. Oh. darling.

215
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.627
What a wonderful treat
to hear from you today.

216
00:11:28.627 --> 00:11:34.166
Oh. I would be honored.
I would be so honored.

217
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:36.736
But listen. dear.
we're in rehearsal.

218
00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:38.971
Previews start next week.

219
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:42.642
I mean. is there any possibility

220
00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:45.911
that perhaps
this could wait until...

221
00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:48.147
Well. until after we open?

222
00:11:48.147 --> 00:11:49.982
Why can't she
just accept it now?

223
00:11:49.982 --> 00:11:52.752
Oh. it's an actress thing.
Don't even try.

224
00:11:52.752 --> 00:11:54.921
LILLIAN: I knew
you would understand.

225
00:11:54.921 --> 00:11:56.459
Oh. Bill. wait. wait.

226
00:11:57.458 --> 00:11:59.058
Will I see you opening night?

Yes. And the same to you.
Bye now.

230
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.773
- And the Oscar goes to...
- Oh. shut up.

231
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.371
Oh. honey.

232
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:15.341
I'm sorry we got interrupted.
What was it you were saying?

233
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:17.509
- MARGARET: About the braces.
- LILLIAN: Yes. yes. yes.

234
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:18.877
Well. George has
a new commission.

235
00:12:18.877 --> 00:12:21.748
He's doing a... restoration
on a brownstone in Brooklyn.

236
00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:22.982
But until that gets started...

237
00:12:22.982 --> 00:12:25.179
Lillian. It's time to get
your bony ass in gear.

238
00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:26.889
Well. isn't he painting?

239
00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:28.921
Well. yeah. yeah. yeah.

240
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:32.124
He's doing some
really fantastic watercolors.

241
00:12:32.124 --> 00:12:33.725
but he's between jobs.
you know.

242
00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:35.528
- LILLIAN: Uh-huh.
- And he still hasn't been paid
for the last one.

243
00:12:35.528 --> 00:12:36.362
- So...
- Oh.

244
00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:38.731
Lillian.
You're leaving in 20 minutes.

245
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:40.399
Twenty minutes?

246
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.034
Oh my God. I'm not dressed.

247
00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:45.204
I haven't combed my hair.
I haven't even brushed my teeth.

248
00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:46.972
Listen. sweetheart.

249
00:12:46.972 --> 00:12:50.443
We will talk
about this very soon.

250
00:12:50.443 --> 00:12:51.777
- Okay? All right.
- Okay. yeah.

251
00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:54.483
Yeah. yeah.
Whoa! I gotta go too.

252
00:12:56.617 --> 00:12:58.551
- So. okay.
- LILLIAN: Dogs and chickens.

253
00:12:58.551 --> 00:13:00.990

Okay.

Eight thousand dollars?
What do I look like. a bank?

260

would be a lot more fun.

Do you think actors
should have children?

274
00:13:57.309 --> 00:13:59.445
You want an argument
or an answer?

275
00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:00.547
LILLIAN: An answer.

276
00:14:00.547 --> 00:14:01.617
No.

Why not?

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.885
- Now you want an argument.
- LILLIAN: Come on.

279
00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:08.455
There are a lot of actors
who are also parents.

280
00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:10.623
That's known as an oxymoron.

- Red to the corner.
- Wait.

uh. subtext.

ever heard of subtext. huh?

- LILLIAN: All right.

333
00:16:42.942 --> 00:16:46.179
What about emotional recall
or sense memory?

334
00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:49.581
Does the name Stanislavski
mean anything to anyone?

335

I mean. we are doing Chekhov.
aren't we?

Or is this just a sitcom
where we hit our marks.

No. you didn't.
You didn't. You never would.
