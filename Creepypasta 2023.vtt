GIRL'’S VOICE:
Do you know what a Creepypasta is?

4
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.466
Here's the short answer.

5
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.100
It's a scary story

6
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.433
shared on the Internet.

7
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.866
But they're much more than that.

8
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.200
I could tell you why...

9
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.666
but I'd rather show you.

10
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.666
ANNOUNCER: Local and state
police are still investigating

11
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.066
a possible connection
between multiple

12
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.066
disappearances in the
same neighborhood.

13
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.033
beginning last week
with a 14 year old girl

14
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.666
whose name has not yet
been released to the public.

15
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.733
The teenager was revealed
to be the author

16
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.033
of popular online horror stories
known as "“Creepypasta."”

17
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.533
Detectives believe the clue to
her disappearance could be found

18
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.833
in her most recent story. which
apparently remains unfinished.

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.833
Her stories disappeared from her

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.266
laptop the night
she went missing.

21
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.466
But thousands of
people have already

22
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.366
copied them all over the Web.

23
00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.900
GIRL'’S VOICE:
We each have a story within us.

24
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.900
Stories that tell us who we are.

25
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.733
Not all of them
have a happy ending.

26
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500
Hello?

27
00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.766
Anybody here?

28
00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:44.300
Sometimes it's hard to tell

29
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.466
which story is yours.

30
00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:56.200
You may never know...

31
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.266
...until it'’s too late.

32
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.233
We hear them when we're kids.

33
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.566
Stories from our nightmares.

34
00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:23.833
Tales of the Boogeyman.

35
00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:42.600
Emma. what the
hell are you doing?

36
00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:46.266
Wasn'’t me.

37
00:12:50.033 --> 00:12:52.233
Oh. was it your little
fake friend "“Jumby?"”

38
00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:53.733
Shut up.

39
00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:55.166
He's not fake.

40
00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:56.700
You'’re such a baby.

41
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.933
Everyone knows
you'’re making him up.

42
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.133
Besides. we're on
the second floor.

43
00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:05.733
Nobody'’s out there.

44
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.000
You ruined our game!

45
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.633
Nobody is out there.

46
00:13:13.633 --> 00:13:15.833
You ruined our game!

47
00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:17.533
Go to sleep or
I'll tell. and you

48
00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:19.066
can forget about
your little game

49
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:20.333
with rocks and dirt.

50
00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:27.233
You know they'’ll send you away
to a mental hospital?

51
00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:28.900
Strap you down
and fry your brain.

52
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.666
He wouldn't let that happen.

53
00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:32.733
He's not real. stupid!

54
00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:34.766
Go to sleep or I'll tell Mom.

55
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.500
You'’re mean.

56
00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:42.900
I can'’t believe I still have to
share a room with you.

57
00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.800
Emma? Quit playing.

58
00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:46.200
Emma?

59
00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:49.466
Honest. see I told
you he was real!

60
00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:51.833
Holy crap!

61
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.633
[strange whispering]

62
00:14:55.966 --> 00:14:58.400
Come down. Jumby
wants to meet you.

63
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.700
Get away from him.

64
00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.366
We'’re building a house.

65
00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:02.866
You can have your own room!

66
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.400
Come inside. You're not
safe out there.

67
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.033
What are you so afraid of?

68
00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:10.800
He's my friend.

69
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.133
He's not going to do anything!

70
00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:15.766
Emma! Emma! Emma!

71
00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:18.700
Put my sister down!

72
00:15:20.233 --> 00:15:21.300
Emma!

73
00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:25.100
Emma. Emma!

74
00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:33.533
ANNOUNCER:
Police are looking into the disappearance of Emily Hall.

75
00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.066
She went missing from her home.

76
00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:37.400
Although half the security
system was not triggered.

77
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.300
Emily was in her second floor
bedroom with her sister Anna.

78
00:15:40.733 --> 00:15:43.733
Anna. still in a state of shock.
keeps muttering the word:

79
00:15:43.733 --> 00:15:45.400
"“Jumby."”

80
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.966
The Boogeyman doesn't
go away when you get older.

81
00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:00.966
he just waits

82
00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:03.033
until the right moment
to come back.

83
00:17:58.366 --> 00:17:59.200
May I have

84
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.733
A glass of water. please?

85
00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:26.333
I'’M THIRSTY!

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.000

87
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.600
[coughing and choking]

88
00:24:07.766 --> 00:24:11.300
[distorted voice on television]

89
00:24:18.433 --> 00:24:20.166
The characters in my stories

90
00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:23.233
never know what's
going to happen to them.

91
00:24:23.233 --> 00:24:25.233
but sometimes

92
00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:27.600
they get a glimpse of the truth.

93
00:24:29.933 --> 00:24:33.600
So the FDA allows
one rodent hair

94
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.600
for 100 grams of peanut butter.

95
00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:40.100
Eww! Ohh. that is gross!

96
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.266
Okay. Okay. I got one.

97
00:24:42.266 --> 00:24:43.766
If you go swimming in a lake.

98
00:24:43.766 --> 00:24:45.400
there's a possibility
that you could

99
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.766
inhale an amoeba and it
will literally eat your brain.

100
00:24:49.766 --> 00:24:51.233
True. I watched a
documentary about it.

101
00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:52.266
Boom.

102
00:24:52.266 --> 00:24:53.966
But what is the likelihood?

103
00:24:54.466 --> 00:24:56.733
Big enough not to
go swimming in lakes.

104
00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:59.066
That's why I only
swim in the ocean.

105
00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:01.033
Okay. calm down. West Side.

106
00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:02.200
All right. I got one.

107
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.133
Did you know that raccoons
can fit into a hole

108
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.666
four inches wide?

109
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.533
Go on...

110
00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:13.666
Your rectum can stretch
up to nine inches in diameter.

111
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.666
So theoretically. you could fit
a raccoon in your butt.

112
00:25:19.633 --> 00:25:21.066
Oh .Girl!

113
00:25:21.066 --> 00:25:24.166
Ahh. and here I was. just
using gerbils like a casual.

114
00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:26.133
You guys are disgusting.

115
00:25:27.466 --> 00:25:29.566
All right. just away
from the gross stuff.

116
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.200
Here's one.

117
00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:36.033
You know how sometimes
you think you can see something

118
00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:38.066
out of the corner of your eye

119
00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:40.066
and you look at it
and it's not there.

120
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.666
That's because your vision
is far more acute

121
00:25:43.666 --> 00:25:45.866
in your peripherals than it is
when looking straight on.

122
00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:48.000
So when you see something...

123
00:25:50.033 --> 00:25:52.733
it might actually be there.

124
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.833
And how is that weird?

125
00:25:56.133 --> 00:25:58.033
It's called the
"“Shadow Person"” theory.

126
00:25:58.033 --> 00:25:59.533
I've actually heard of this.

127
00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:00.866
They say that what you're seeing

128
00:26:00.866 --> 00:26:03.200
are interdimensional beings.

129
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.733
Shadow People.

130
00:26:05.733 --> 00:26:08.266
They're stuck in
between two worlds.

132
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.800
Mmm hmm.

133
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.133
So whatever you do. don't
acknowledge their presence.

134
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.900
It could be an
invitation into our world.

135
00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:28.133
Oh. come on!

136
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.866
Better safe than sorry.

137
00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:32.400
That's ridiculous.

138
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.200
We had to have acute vision
in our peripherals.

139
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.900
It's an evolutionary holdover.

140
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.633
Lions were stalking us.

141
00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:42.100

142
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.466
Yeah.

143
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.900
There's another world

144
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.300
that sometimes brushes
up against ours.

nightlight. right?

367
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.100
Well... El Cuco can't get you
if you flash that light on him.

368
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.800
Okay?

369
01:12:33.666 --> 01:12:34.933
Now it'’s time to get to bed.

370
01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:41.600
I'm sorry.

371
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.533
For what?

372
01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.633
[doorbell rings]

373
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.433
That'’s probably your mom.

374
01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:49.700
Could you lay back down?

375
01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.966
I told her I'd have you asleep
by the time she got back.

376
01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:53.633
Please?

377
01:12:54.633 --> 01:12:56.766
No. don't go downstairs!

378
01:12:56.766 --> 01:12:57.666
He'’ll eat you.

379
01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.366
Nothing's going to eat me.

380
01:13:01.366 --> 01:13:02.533
It's fine.

381
01:13:02.533 --> 01:13:04.400
Now. please lay back down.

382
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.333
Please?

383
01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:29.333
Hey --

384
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.366
He'’s here!

385
01:13:33.266 --> 01:13:34.033
Mateo!

386
01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.066
Mateo?

387
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.133
Mateo?

388
01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:16.333
Mateo...

389
01:14:32.133 --> 01:14:34.000
[muffled screaming]

390
01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:47.600
Dont!

391
01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.733
Shit!

392
01:15:09.233 --> 01:15:10.000
Mateo!

393
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.066
Come out here!

394
01:15:11.066 --> 01:15:12.066
What are you doing?

395
01:15:13.033 --> 01:15:14.133
Come back out here!

396
01:15:29.966 --> 01:15:32.733
[monster growls]

397
01:15:35.633 --> 01:15:36.466
[scream]

398
01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:38.200
[ring tone]

399
01:15:47.533 --> 01:15:49.166
[telephone ringing]

400
01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.133
This is my last
story of the night.

401
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.866
But I'm still working
on the ending.

402
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.633
I think I have it figured out.

403
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.600
Marco?

404
01:17:14.033 --> 01:17:15.200
She told me everything.

405
01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:18.600
What? Who'’s she?

406
01:17:18.866 --> 01:17:19.833
"“Who'’s she?"”

407
01:17:21.766 --> 01:17:23.000
You know who she is.

408
01:17:27.433 --> 01:17:28.633
How long?

409
01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:31.866
How long did you think
you could keep playing me. man?

410
01:17:32.866 --> 01:17:34.966
We were going to
tell you together.

411
01:17:36.933 --> 01:17:38.600
You were going to
tell me together.

412
01:17:40.766 --> 01:17:42.133
You and my girl.

413
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.333
You all were going to tell me
you were pregnant with my...

414
01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:48.066
I'’m sorry.

415
01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.166
Did you --

416
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.766
She's gone.

417
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.600
She'’s gone. man.

418
01:18:00.766 --> 01:18:01.733
The baby --

419
01:18:01.733 --> 01:18:04.100
I loved you. You were my guy...

420
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.366
You knew what I
wanted to do with her

421
01:18:08.366 --> 01:18:09.933
and you were going to be
the godfather of my child!

422
01:18:09.933 --> 01:18:12.233
Stand the fuck up
when I'm talking to you!

423
01:18:16.033 --> 01:18:17.433
I'm just -- just --

424
01:18:17.433 --> 01:18:18.900
Just what?

425
01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:21.566
Hey. hey. hey --

426
01:18:23.333 --> 01:18:24.200
What?

427
01:18:28.733 --> 01:18:30.333
Get your fucking hands down!

428
01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:32.000
Okay. okay! Just --

429
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:35.066
Just wait...

430
01:18:35.066 --> 01:18:36.666
Just wait. huh?

431
01:18:36.666 --> 01:18:38.000
It'’ll be all right...
just wait --

432
01:18:53.566 --> 01:18:56.500
Now it's time to
share it with the world.

433
01:19:47.666 --> 01:19:48.500
Help me...

434
01:19:49.766 --> 01:19:50.600
Help me...

435
01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.633
Help me. please...

436
01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.400
Sorry. Marco.

437
01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.233
Please!

438
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.833
They can'’t hear you.

439
01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:13.500
They'’re not real...

440
01:20:14.266 --> 01:20:15.100
Help me...

441
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.666
...and neither are you.

442
01:20:25.466 --> 01:20:27.633
Where do you think you'’re going?

443
01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.300
This is your home now!

444
01:20:31.466 --> 01:20:32.300
Help me...

445
01:20:32.966 --> 01:20:35.466
What kind of
storyteller would I be

446
01:20:35.466 --> 01:20:39.466
if I let my characters
get away with murder?

447
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:47.900
You'’re story'’s
finished now. Marco.

448
01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.333
How do you like the ending?

449
01:20:54.633 --> 01:20:56.000
I had a little help.

450
01:20:58.766 --> 01:21:03.900
[childlike laughter]

451
01:21:28.533 --> 01:21:29.866
My next story...

452
01:21:31.166 --> 01:21:32.833
Will be about you.

453
01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.866
How do you think it will end?
