Our broadcasts will resume

7
00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.522
An IDF spokesperson
has informed us

8
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.316
that Syrian forces
are attacking in the north.

9
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.693
The Egyptians are advancing
in the Sinai Desert.

10
00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:38.321
in the south.
and bombing our forces.

11
00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.950
If Syria conquers
the Golan Heights.

12
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:45.119
Israel will be vulnerable
to a large-scale invasion.

13
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:23.045
Good evening to our listeners.

14
00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:26.174
A press conference will start
in a moment in Tel Aviv

15
00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.759
with Prime Minister.
Golda Meir.

16
00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:30.636
We will be broadcasting
live on our channel

17
00:24:30.761 --> 00:24:33.681
as the Prime Minister
addresses the nation.

18
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:58.516
They are all around us.
They are everywhere.

19
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:01.477
The entire valley
is infested with Syrian tanks.

20
00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:03.604
We are being smashed down here.

21
00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:10.820
I have lost an entire platoon.
I have to retreat.

22
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:14.282
Get back in there. Lieutenant.
Do not retreat.

23
00:26:16.284 --> 00:26:19.870
They can't take the north.
Drive forward!

24
00:26:19.996 --> 00:26:22.206
We are heading into hell.
My whole team is gone.

25
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:24.000
Stay calm and do as you're told!

26
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.127
I can't hold the line anymore.
I need urgent help! Over!

27
00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:29.755
They're destroying our tanks
with infantry and shells.

28
00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:36.554
I've not seen anything like this.
It's an onslaught. Over.

29
00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:40.141
Point-blank range! Thousands
of tanks are in front of us!

30
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:43.853
They're firing at us!
They're slaughtering us! Over!

31
00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:46.272
We need help...

32
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.389
Move out. Cross the plain.

33
00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:20.267
Move fast. Don't make yourself
an easy target.

34
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:23.771
Let's terrify them.
Destroy anything that moves.

35
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:28.484
We're moving fast.
Why aren't they firing?

36
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.280
What was that?
Was that a tank?

37
00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:35.866
It's not a tank.
Where is it?

38
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:37.951
I can see our fortresses
on the canal.

39
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:40.370
- Has anyone seen it?
- I think it's our forces.

40
00:34:40.496 --> 00:34:43.165
It's not ours and it's not a tank.
I can hear its whistle.

41
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.334
- What is it?
- It's not coming from a tank.

42
00:34:45.459 --> 00:34:47.252
- It's an RPG.
- Where is it coming from?

43
00:34:47.377 --> 00:34:48.921
I can't see a thing.

44
00:34:49.046 --> 00:34:51.006
I've been hit. I've been hit.
My tank's been hit!

45
00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:52.549
It's Sagger missiles.

46
00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:55.260
It's an ambush.
They're covering the whole area.

47
00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:57.679
Insert a shell! Always
have a shell in the barrel.

48
00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:58.722
We're under fire.

49
00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:00.766
We're getting smashed.

50
00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:08.440
Retreat. retreat! Saggers are
being fired nonstop. Retreat.

51
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.571
Hundreds of Saggers
have been fired.

52
00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:17.157
We're at the firing line!
Retreat!

53
00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:19.993
This is the commander.
Fire back at them!

54
00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:22.037
What are you waiting for?

55
00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:23.872
I can't fire!
The shell is stuck!

56
00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:25.082
The shell is stuck!

57
00:35:25.207 --> 00:35:28.001
This is the commander.
No one retreats.

58
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.461
Go back to your positions

59
00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:32.172
and fire back at them!
Is that clear?

60
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.466
My whole section is injured.
We don't stand a chance.

61
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:37.344
It's vital we secure the line.
Don't retreat.

62
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:41.098
This is an order.
I repeat. do not retreat!

63
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.976
I want reinforcements
if it's possible. Over.

64
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:46.937
This is Three.
The enemy has infiltrated...

65
00:35:50.607 --> 00:35:52.317
This is the commander.

66
00:35:52.442 --> 00:35:55.988
Hold positions and secure
the line immediately. Over.

67
00:35:56.113 --> 00:35:57.948
My squad commander is dead.

68
00:35:58.073 --> 00:36:00.909
Adar is dead.
I'm aba... I'm abandoning...

69
00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:02.411
Please send us help!

70
00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:05.038
I... I don't want to die...

71
00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:09.501
I want... I want to go home!
I want to go ho...

72
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:21.638
The Zionists are dead.

73
00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:23.974
We are in full control
of the area.

74
00:49:40.937 --> 00:49:42.772
According to
the Geneva agreements.

75
00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:44.982
both sides
have to provide information

76
00:49:45.108 --> 00:49:46.734
about their prisoners of war.

77
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:49.570
The propaganda
from the Arab countries...

78
00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:52.407
...reveals very little
about the number of prisoners

79
00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:53.991
and missing persons.

80
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.723
This is the commander.
I see exhaust fumes.

81
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:24.684
The Egyptians are on the move.
They're crossing the Sinai.

82
00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:28.855
Hold on. Don't open fire until
they're in a 1.000-metre range.

83
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.316
Wait until then.
Let them get closer. All clear?

84
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:34.527
This is One. They are
2.000 meters away. Over.

85
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:37.196
Commander. this is Two.

86
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:39.657
I've identified movement
towards me.

87
00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:43.619
They are exposed.
We can knock them out easily.

88
00:52:43.744 --> 00:52:46.539
This is the commander.
Open fire when I command.

89
00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:49.417
Wait for them
to be in a 1.000-meter range.

90
00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:50.585
then open fire.

91
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:53.129
Good luck.
We're counting on you.

92
00:52:55.756 --> 00:52:57.884
This is Two.
They are 1.500 meters away

93
00:52:58.009 --> 00:52:59.594
and approaching quickly.

94
00:52:59.719 --> 00:53:01.804
This is Three.
1.200 meters. Over.

95
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.848
Station One.
prepare to open fire.

96
00:53:03.973 --> 00:53:08.811
Three. two. one... Fire!

97
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:18.738
Don't allow them
to lift their heads!

98
00:53:18.863 --> 00:53:21.032
Come on. get them. fire!
Without fear!

99
00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:27.330
Commander. this is Two.
We're destroyed four tanks.

100
00:53:27.455 --> 00:53:30.458
Commander. this is Four.
We're destroyed five tanks.

101
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:32.627
This is the commander.
Keep going! Don't stop!

102
00:53:32.752 --> 00:53:34.587
Direct fire! Don't let them
get to the line!

103
00:53:35.755 --> 00:53:39.508
Steady fire.
Don't waste a shot.

104
00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:41.510
Keep firing.

105
00:53:43.596 --> 00:53:46.098
This is the commander.
We're taking them all out.

106
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:49.685
I repeat. all of them!
Don't leave even one tank!

107
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:53.439
They are fleeing.
I see some on foot.

108
00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:56.192
They've had enough.
They're retreating.

109
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:57.568
This is the commander.

110
00:53:57.693 --> 00:54:01.280
Don't stop! Don't stop!
Don't let them run away!

111
00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:04.283
Fire everywhere. the whole area!

112
00:54:04.408 --> 00:54:06.661
Commander. I'm chasing them
to the canal.

113
00:54:06.786 --> 00:54:11.457
Stay put. Don't move forward.
I repeat. don't move forward.

114
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:51.325
All units. listen up.
We're going in.

115
00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:54.495
Move out.

116
00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.914
And let's button up until we
know what's on the other side.

117
00:56:57.039 --> 00:57:00.376
Station Two.
this is the commander.

118
00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:03.129
We're heading in
towards the canal.

119
00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:18.144
Two here. Close the route.

120
00:57:19.979 --> 00:57:23.607
Two. start crossing
to the other side. Over.

121
00:57:23.732 --> 00:57:26.360
Acapulco. we did it!
We've crossed the canal.

122
00:57:26.485 --> 00:57:27.444
We're in Africa.

123
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.339
Heavy fire! It's an ambush!
We are surrounded.

124
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:53.470
Large arms are hitting
the whole brigade. It's a trap.

125
00:57:53.596 --> 00:57:58.767
We're being hit by massive fire.

126
00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:04.899
They're behind us.
The Egyptians are attacking.

127
00:58:05.024 --> 00:58:07.568
Gunner. put the shell in there.
And smash them now!

128
00:58:07.693 --> 00:58:10.487
I can't! It's stuck!
I can't!

129
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:23.459
David. put the shell in
and fire now!

130
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:32.301
I am trying!

131
00:58:32.426 --> 00:58:35.930
He's dead!

132
00:58:36.055 --> 00:58:38.182
184. what's going on?

133
00:58:38.307 --> 00:58:40.142
We're being killed here.
I just lost my commander.

134
00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:44.897
This is Two. Wait patiently.
Wait in the bunkers.

135
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:46.982
They're firing at us! Killing us.

136
00:58:47.107 --> 00:58:48.984
This is One.

137
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:51.862
Stay calm. we will get you support.

138
00:58:51.987 --> 00:58:55.491
We need support now!
We are surrounded by Egyptians.

139
00:58:55.616 --> 00:58:57.660
Reload the gun quickly!
Come on. now!

140
00:58:57.785 --> 00:59:00.704
I can't! It's stuck!
It won't go in!

141
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:03.040
They're coming!
Reload it now!

142
00:59:03.165 --> 00:59:06.085
I can't! I'm trying. I'm trying!

143
01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:43.943
Prime Minister Golda Meir

144
01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.738
visited the soldiers
at the front this morning.

145
01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.783
while wearing her famous shoes

146
01:12:49.908 --> 01:12:52.952
that are nowadays known
as "Golda shoes".

147
01:12:53.078 --> 01:12:54.746
She immediately
opens the newspaper.

148
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:57.290
reading every page.

149
01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:01.795
This is our Prime Minister's
first visit to Egypt.

150
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.799
She stands up and looks out
with some excitement.

151
01:13:09.928 --> 01:13:11.930
We are completely confident

152
01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:15.100
in holding the vast desert land
we've conquered.

153
01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:17.644
This land creates
a complete separation

154
01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:20.063
between us
and the Third Army soldiers

155
01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.899
who crossed the canal.
and moved towards us.

156
01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:28.238
Her face shows sadness.

157
01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:31.699
She seems to be aware
of the heavy cost in human life

158
01:13:31.825 --> 01:13:33.409
caused by crossing the canal.

159
01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:47.132
Her first time
on the Egyptian side.

160
01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:48.842
She is greeted by many soldiers.

161
01:13:48.967 --> 01:13:51.177
- All the best to you.
- Hey.

162
01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:55.598
- Hey. hey.
- Wait. guys.

163
01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:57.934
The soldiers
on the surrounding dunes

164
01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:00.770
are waiting patiently
for a group photo.

165
01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.439
Mrs. Meir
is also waiting patiently.

166
01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:06.568
until the last photographer
can capture this special moment.

167
01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:10.780
The soldiers who surround her
leave her no choice.

168
01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.824
- As you move...
- Softly.

169
01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:16.744
We'd already encircled
the Third Army at that point.

170
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.581
and we could've wiped them out

171
