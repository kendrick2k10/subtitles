00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:04.250
NOVEMBER 1968

7
00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:11.750
Mr. Gary.

8
00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:23.000
That man looks really ill. Who is he?
Wasn't he here yesterday as well?

9
00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:26.625
He's been here all week.
He's an Italian engineer.

10
00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:29.333
That weird car outside. is that his?

11
00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.791
Yes. it is.

12
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:35.375
He desperately wants you
to read a file he's brought.

13
00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.291
I didn't want to bother you with it.

14
00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:42.208
Did you tell him we deal with disputes
between sovereign states?

15
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.416
He says he's a head of state.

16
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.125
and that he won't leave
until I give you the file.

17
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.250
He's a bit crazy but also very determined.

18
00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:53.916
This is what we're going to do.

19
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:58.416
Hand me the file.
and make it look like a big deal.

20
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:08.333
Here's the file I told you about.

21
00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.541
Thank you.

22
00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.458
I'll read it very carefully.

23
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:15.791
Very well. Thank you. sir. Goodbye.

24
00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:09.833
Where is he?

25
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.000
-Who?
-The mad man with pneumonia.

26
00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.041
-I managed to get rid of him.
-No!

27
00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.041
Bring him to my office.
I need to talk to him.

28
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.166
Come on. quick!

29
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.875
Mr. Rosa. I have to ask you
if you know what day it is

30
00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.708
and where you are.

31
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:31.333
November 10th. 1968.

32
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.250
Strasbourg. Council of Europe.

33
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:39.250
And what can the Council of Europe
do for you. Mr. Rosa?

34
00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:41.291
Save my island.

35
00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:43.250
Did you buy an island?

36
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.041
No. I made it.

37
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:47.375
He created an island.

38
00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.750
How many days did it take you
to create this island?

39
00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:54.083
Please. don't say six.
that would be an incredible coincidence.

40
00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:56.750
No. it wasn't six days.
It took me several months.

41
00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:59.458
So you own an island
that you have created.

42
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:05.333
No. I didn't say that.
I'm an engineer. I simply built it. then…

43
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.416
we created the world on the island…

44
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.416
I should just leave.
This man's in a confused state.

45
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.541
He needs help but clearly not from us.

46
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.916
I need help from the European Council.
That's why I'm here.

47
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.583
Keep calm. Mr. Rosa.

48
00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:21.333
I can't keep calm.
They're going to destroy everything.

49
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.458
Is this the island that you built?

50
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.333
Yes. like I said. I'm an engineer.

51
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:38.500
Doctor. my ass! Piss off!

52
00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:42.583
ONE YEAR EARLIER

53
00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:45.833
Doctor. my ass! Piss off!

54
00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:51.250
Doctor. my ass! Piss off!

55
00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.500
If I may. we're already doctors.

56
00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:56.833
We've passed our exam.
so now we're engineers not--

57
00:05:56.916 --> 00:06:01.875
Engineer. my ass! Piss off!

58
00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.375
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:08.833
Forfeit!

60
00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:11.958
What forfeit?
I was just talking… It's not fair!

61
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.500
Guys. he's right.
If you challenge a professional--

62
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:17.000
-You stole my glass!
-Forfeit!

63
00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:19.458
What? I was talking
about the engineer thing.

64
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:23.125
They insist.
I'd say a fair forfeit could be…

65
00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:25.875
to have him…

66
00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.791
make a complete ass of himself!

67
00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.166
-But these aren't the rules…
-Ass of himself!

68
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.333
-I didn't lose!
-Ass of himself!

69
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.875
So. the first girl that walks in.

70
00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.791
he must chat her up.
and when she least expects it.

71
00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:43.208
he kisses her on her lips!

72
00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:45.791
Shit!

73
00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.000
Hi.

74
00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:49.083
How's it going?

75
00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:52.208
It's good to see you.

76
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.125
I'll be right there.

77
00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:56.875
-Yes.
-Kiss!

78
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.250
Well. it's…

79
00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:01.291
It's just that today
we took our state exam.

80
00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:04.500
I'm now officially an engineer.

81
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.416
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

82
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.666
Guys. we can't do the kiss thing.

83
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.333
We can't do that…

84
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.333
They want me to kiss you.
because I lost a drinking game.

85
00:07:15.416 --> 00:07:17.291
-Sure.
-I didn't even lose.

86
00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.333
They're just insisting because…

87
00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:22.833
Guys. We can't do that.
We just can't do that.

88
00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:24.541
Guys. it's not gonna happen.

89
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.250
Right. there's no point
that they keep saying…

90
00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:29.333
We just can't do that. you know…

91
00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.291
You look good.

92
00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.541
You look very good.

93
00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:35.458
Honestly.

94
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.000
Thanks.

95
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.625
Fancy a drink?

96
00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:44.916
Well. anyway…

97
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.208
It's a funny coincidence
running into each other here--

98
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.750
Not really. Bologna isn't a big town.

99
00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:52.833
Yeah. sure.

100
00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.041
Last time we saw each other.

101
00:07:57.083 --> 00:07:59.333
you were seeing that guy. that--

102
00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.333
-Carlo.
-Carlo. that's right.

103
00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:03.958
Carlo.

104
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:06.208
He's not here. is he?

105
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:09.041
We've been having problems lately.

106
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:12.708
I'm sorry to hear that.

107
00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:14.833
No. you're not.

108
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.708
Come on. it was clear that you were…

109
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:21.125
Well. that your relationship was like…

110
00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:22.500
just a temporary one.

111
00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.791
How long have you been together?
A few months?

112
00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:25.708
Three years.

113
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:26.708
Three years?

114
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:29.458
That's almost as long as we were.

115
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.750
I guess your parents like him.

116
00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:36.000
-Why are you having problems?
-My parents liked you.

117
00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.958
Your dad hated me. You didn't answer me.

118
00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:40.000
Well. maybe he hated you a bit. but…

119
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:43.125
not much considering
he nearly lost his sight

120
00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:46.291
when you blew up his TV
during the Italy vs. Russia match.

121
00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:48.416
And you never apologized to me or him.

122
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.166
It imploded.
and you're still not answering.

123
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.875
We fell out because after three years.
he believes we should get married.

124
00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.875
-Imploded?
-I knew there was something.

125
00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.208
Get married? Be careful about marriage.

126
00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:00.833
He's not the right man.

127
00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:03.916
How do you know if you don't know him?
Now you're not answering.

128
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.833
The cathode tube implodes.
it doesn't explode.

129
00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:08.416
Electrons flow through the vacuum.

130
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.666
And I told your father a thousand times
to sit further away.

131
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.041
I just wanted him to enjoy
the football match. Those three lines--

132
00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:16.625
Sorry. Giorgio. It's eleven o'clock…

133
00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:18.583
How can you watch a match with lines?

134
00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:21.250
-I have to go. I've got a class tomorrow.
-Wait.

135
00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.083
I'll drive you home.

136
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.958
Since when do you have a car?

137
00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:41.708
Excuse the interior.

138
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:44.750
I built this car for the engineering exam.

139
00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:48.541
I thought it'd be interesting
to make something practical.

140
00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:52.000
And I focused a bit more
on the engine than the interior.

141
00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:56.833
To speed things up.
I used my grandma's sofa as seats.

142
00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.416
She's dead now anyway.

143
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.916
-Grandma Margherita is dead?
-Yes. two months ago.

144
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.666
-She couldn't take our breaking up.
-We split up three years ago. Come on.

145
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.500
Yes. it was a slow decline.
She deteriorated slowly.

146
00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:11.791
-Giorgio…
-Can you remind me why we split up?

147
00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:15.875
Because being with you is too risky.

148
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.291
You have to take risks
if you want to try and change the world.

149
00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:22.666
You're hardly changing the world
getting rid of three lines on a TV.

150
00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:28.500
-It's beautiful. you know?
-What is?

151
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:31.166
-The car.
-Thank you!

152
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:34.750
It's weird. but…

153
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.500
you built a car by yourself.
and it works. It runs!

154
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:41.791
It might not be Diabolik's Jaguar but--

155
00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.875
Whose Jaguar did you say?

156
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:46.083
Diabolik's.

157
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.750
-Diabolik. The King of Terror.
-Who's he?

158
00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:50.625
The new comic everyone's talking about!

159
00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:53.416
-Never heard of it. honestly.
-It's great.

160
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.708
Basically. it's about
this very clever thief

161
00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:01.458
who always wears… who always wears a mask…

162
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:05.333
-They want us.
-Do they? Okay. let's pull over.

163
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.083
Hello.

164
00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:28.500
Yes.

165
00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:31.500
-Good evening.
-Evening.

166
00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:35.625
Is there a reason why
this vehicle has no license plate?

167
00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:39.291
Because I didn't buy this vehicle.
I actually built it.

168
00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:41.250
This car has no license plate?

169
00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.791
To be honest.
I didn't think about that at all.

170
00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:46.875
All right. if you want to be funny.
step outside. please.

171
00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:51.416
Driving license and registration.
Salvatore. check their criminal records.

172
00:11:54.666 --> 00:11:55.541
And here we are.

173
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:59.041
Let me explain.

174
00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:03.416
I built this car with my own hands.
because I'm an engineer.

175
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.916
So it's the same principle
as with the license plate.

176
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.333
I don't have a registration
nor driving license--

177
00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:12.083
You drove me around
without a driving license?

178
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:15.250
-I drove you. I didn't force you. did I?
-Yes.

179
00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.125
-You insisted.
-I insisted?

180
00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:20.375
I'd have never driven you around Bologna
in a car with no plate.

181
00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:22.041
no driving license. half-drunk--

182
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:23.500
Did you say "drunk"?

183
00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:24.750
No. I'm not drunk.

184
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.333
I lost a drinking game.
Actually. I didn't lose--

185
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:29.958
Salvatore. so do these two
have criminal records?

186
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.000
I'm a lawyer. address us politely.
We're not "these two." thanks.

187
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:36.291
That's right. She's my lawyer.

188
00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:37.333
So let's keep calm.

189
00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:41.375
Giorgio. I'm not your lawyer.
I'm an international law associate.

190
00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:44.041
Bummer. Bloody useless international law…

191
00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:45.375
Nothing on the lady.

192
00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:48.791
-But Rosa has a criminal record.
-What about Rosa?

193
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:51.791
That's not a criminal record.
it's a flying ban.

194
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.750
They're two totally different things.

195
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:57.000
And as per the judge's order.
I disassembled the biplane.

196
00:12:57.083 --> 00:12:59.708
I worked two summers
to pay for those street lights.

197
00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:02.083
-Please…
-You flew an unregistered plane?

198
00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:06.166
Yes. I did. What's with this fixation
with registering everything?

199
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.541
Shall we also put a plate
on the bottom of each bird that's flying

200
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.791
in Piazza Maggiore?

201
00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:14.750
Salvatore. his car's in the way.
Move it. then call the tow truck.

202
00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:17.875
You don't need to. Salvatore. I can do it.

203
00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.750
You'll break it.
You don't know how to start it.

204
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.916
Stand back.
This vehicle is being impounded.

205
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.208
Impounded?
You must be joking. Salvatore. wait!

206
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.625
-Salvatore. stop. You'll break it!
-Stand back.

207
00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:32.666
-Didn't you hear me?
-You'll break it.

208
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.375
-Listen!
-I'm listening!

209
00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:35.666
-Stop!
-Don't touch him.

210
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.083
-He's touching everything.
-Keep your hands down!

211
00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:06.458
There was no need for you to come.

212
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:10.666
They didn't need to wake you up for that.
I was handling it just fine.

213
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.416
The judge was going to convict you
because you're a repeat offender.

214
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.000
They're different things.

215
00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:19.208
This one happened on the ground.
the other one was air-related.

216
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:23.041
Why don't you just try. Giorgio?

217
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.000
-Try what?
-To be normal.

218
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.916
You'd be happier. Look at yourself now.

219
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.500
What are you talking about?
Listen to yourself. "Be normal"…

220
00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:36.375
I managed to meet Battistini
and showed him the blueprints of your car.

221
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.125
He was so impressed.
he wants you on his team of engineers.

222
00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:42.458
Dad. don't show my stuff to people.
It's private.

223
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:44.875
It's a sought-after position.
You should be glad.

224
00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:49.458
Yes. I know. Dad. Thanks.

225
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.416
Could you please pull over?
I want to get out.

226
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.541
-Why don't you come home?
-I want to get out.

227
00:14:55.625 --> 00:14:58.375
Just stop the car and let me out!

228
00:14:59.791 --> 00:15:02.000
Where are you going now?

229
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.583
Called to answer charges
for crimes against humanity.

230
00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:11.250
the Nazis appealed to the positive law.

231
00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:16.625
alluding to their famous phrase.
"We were just following orders."

232
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.500
In other words. "We were obeying the law."

233
00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:23.000
which. no matter how brutal.
was still the law.

234
00:15:23.083 --> 00:15:25.958
To this avoidance of responsibility.

235
00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:29.791
the judges would respond
by appealing to natural law.

236
00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:34.666
Natural law is
that innate sense of justice

237
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.500
which exists in each one of us
reminding us that it's more important…

238
00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:40.500
Can you move over?

239
00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:42.875
…to prioritize what is right
over the rules.

240
00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.583
what is right over the law.

241
00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:47.750
Because laws change.

242
00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:49.958
while what is right will always be right.

243
00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:56.041
And this.

244
00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:00.916
doesn't mean that obeying the law
is not important.

245
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.916
on the contrary. it's extremely important.

246
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.875
Especially the driving laws.
the traffic codes.

247
00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.333
even license plates are important.

248
00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:10.416
Right. That's it for today.

249
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.833
I'll see you next week.
Chapter three. The Tokyo Trial.

250
00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:16.125
Professor.
the class only lasted ten minutes.

251
00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:19.958
Because these are complex concepts
which take time to comprehend.

252
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:23.666
especially for you. Nicolini.
who's already failed three times.

253
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.000
You're coming with me.

254
00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:27.500
Sorry.

255
00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:29.958
Excuse me. Sorry.

256
00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.000
Do you know what these are?

257
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:36.208
Blue fingertips?

258
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.500
They took my fingerprints. Giorgio.

259
00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:40.958
-They already had mine.
-My fingerprints!

260
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:43.666
I'm applying for tenure in six months.

261
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.083
I can't take the exam
if I have a criminal record.

262
00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:50.291
The evening didn't end well.
that's why I'm here. to apologize.

263
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.458
Didn't end well? We were arrested!

264
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:55.166
Okay. it ended badly then. A tragedy.

265
00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:57.875
But… what happened before that…

266
00:16:58.958 --> 00:16:59.958
can't be ignored.

267
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:03.250
-Giorgio. you live in your own world.
-Don't you like it?

268
00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:06.000
No. I don't.
because it ends with getting arrested.

269
00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:10.416
Because you live in your own world.
but this world isn't all yours!

270
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.291
-You didn't build it like your car!
-Then maybe I should.

271
00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:14.958
Should what?

272
00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:16.958
Build my own world.

273
00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:18.708
Giorgio. it was a metaphor.

274
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:21.208
-Would you come?
-You can't build a world!

275
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.000
-Maybe I can--
-No. you can't!

276
00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:27.791
Because you're not a genius.
even though you think you are!

277
00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:32.625
You build toys
that keep getting you arrested.

278
00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:36.416
And for a second. I nearly forgot that.

279
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Goodbye. Giorgio.

280
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:08.541
THREE MONTHS LATER

281
00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:02.583
One second 40.

282
00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:04.958
One second 40 on the fourth lap?

283
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:07.000
-Are you sure?
-Yes. sir.

284
00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:08.791
What shitty tires did we put on?

285
00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:11.000
Luca. we knew it was risky.

286
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:14.083
That's not a risk. That's goddamn suicide!

287
00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:15.625
We must tell Bruno.

288
00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:18.541
Change the strategy. go flat-out.
either it works or it doesn't.

289
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.000
Flat-out from the fourth lap?

290
00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:22.708
Either that
or we get there half an hour later!

291
00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:25.708
Hey. go to corner seven
and show this to Bruno.

292
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:28.875
What the hell are you waiting for?
Hurry up! Go!

293
00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.333
-Who the hell is that?
-He's the new guy.

294
00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:33.666
Battistini says he's a great engineer.

295
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.666
He looks like a moron to me.

296
00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:34.291
OUR PLATFORMS. YOUR ENERGY. YOUR FREEDOM

297
00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:25.708
Sir. I swear we wouldn't even dream
of going anywhere near your safe.

298
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:27.375
Angelo. I understand.

299
00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:31.291
but this is the third time this year
that money has gone missing

300
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:32.708
and it's only February.

301
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.625
Dad. don't worry about this.

302
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.750
I'll deal with it.

303
00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:38.708
It's…

304
00:21:39.291 --> 00:21:42.708
impossible to describe the pain

305
00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:46.333
that you people. with your greed.

306
00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:50.708
have caused to this company.
to this family.

307
00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:52.750
and to this righteous man.

308
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.875
This man who welcomed you
in your time of need.

309
00:21:55.958 --> 00:22:00.541
When you people.
dressed only in desperation.

310
00:22:00.625 --> 00:22:04.666
arrived here
from your remote and wild lands.

311
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.916
And how did you repay him?

312
00:22:07.708 --> 00:22:10.583
By stealing from the hand that fed you.

313
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.000
Mr. Maurizio.

314
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:14.541
there's no proof it was us.

315
00:22:16.916 --> 00:22:17.750
Angelo.

316
00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:21.208
Angelo. how can you say
something like that?

317
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:25.333
In the safe. there were
five bills of 50.000 lire.

318
00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:29.041
Now there are none.
and the only Calabrians here…

319
00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:32.416
are you guys. Or am I wrong?

320
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.958
They've got some nerve…

321
00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:37.208
They're the only ones here. right?

322
00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:45.708
I have to go now.

323
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:49.208
because we have a company to run.
even though…

324
00:22:49.791 --> 00:22:53.000
it'll be more challenging
from today because of you guys.

325
00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:56.083
So we're building a platform.

326
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.458
We're making an island.

327
00:22:58.541 --> 00:23:00.666
Okay. I get it.
but in the shape of a platform.

328
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.708
It's an island!

329
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:04.916
Initially. I wanted to build
a real one with sand and everything.

330
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.041
And I spent months trying to find a way.

331
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:09.916
But it's impossible. Maurizio.

332
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.375
But then…

333
00:23:11.458 --> 00:23:13.083
I saw the solution.

334
00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:15.500
An island made of steel.

335
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.583
-Steel!
-Steel…

336
00:23:17.666 --> 00:23:22.041
Can you imagine? Our own island.
where we can do what the hell we want.

337
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:24.500
Where we can live by our own rules.

338
00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:26.750
So I won't have to work
for my dad anymore?

339
00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:28.666
Of course not!

340
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.333
Because I hate this shipyard.
Do you understand?

341
00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:33.625
I hate smelling the stink of it every day.

342
00:23:33.708 --> 00:23:36.833
The stink of the grease of the ships.
the gas. the Calabrians.

343
00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:39.416
Listen. do you think
we can have a bar too?

344
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.791
A bar where we can drink
what the hell we want?

345
00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:43.166
Yes. of course.

346
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.666
Well. I wouldn't make it
the main attraction. but yes.

347
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.208
-Where do you want to build this island?
-This is the best part.

348
00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:52.708
Outside Italian territorial waters.

349
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.250
Where nobody can bust our balls.

350
00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:56.833
And where is it? Is it far?

351
00:23:57.625 --> 00:23:58.750
Wherever we want.

352
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.083
As long as it's six miles off the coast.

353
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:03.125
I was thinking here.

354
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.250
opposite Rimini.

355
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:06.250
Perfect.

356
00:24:06.833 --> 00:24:07.916
Where do we start?

357
00:24:09.708 --> 00:24:12.083
We look at how they build platforms.

358
00:24:47.791 --> 00:24:49.166
So how do they do it?

359
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.916
Pillars of 34 with reinforced
concrete foundations on the bedrock.

360
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.125
-How big are the foundations?
-I don't know. they're big.

361
00:24:57.208 --> 00:25:00.750
-What do you mean? 90. 150?
-I don't know. I didn't measure them!

362
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.083
You go next time.

363
00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:05.708
Come on. help me up.
Hurry. before someone calls security.

364
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:10.250
Let's recap.
One underwater concrete injector.

365
00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:12.000
Then what? About 30 pillars?

366
00:25:12.083 --> 00:25:13.083
Yes. about that.

367
00:25:13.708 --> 00:25:15.625
Say we build them as thin as 90.

368
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:18.583
Then we need to hire ten skilled workers.

369
00:25:18.666 --> 00:25:22.875
And even if we hire Calabrians.
no insurance. no payroll taxes.

370
00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:25.708
and we fire them
with a random excuse in the last week

371
00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:29.000
and we pay them nothing.
that's 100 million gone already.

372
00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:31.041
If we got rid of the concrete?

373
00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:33.833
We'd get down to 80.
but the problem is transportation.

374
00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:39.250
To move 30 pillars of 90 for six miles.
we'd need a cargo boat.

375
00:25:39.333 --> 00:25:42.708
If they were made of wood.
we could float them there.

376
00:25:43.666 --> 00:25:45.958
It can't be made of wood.
it has to be steel.

377
00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:48.833
I've been told steel doesn't float.

378
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.833
Well…

379
00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:58.208
that ship's made of steel.

380
00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:01.291
and by some weird magic
that I've never understood.

381
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.875
it does float.

382
00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:14.083
So steel doesn't float.

383
00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:16.791
but hollow steel does.

384
00:26:19.375 --> 00:26:22.875
With hollow pillars.
we solve the problem of transportation.

385
00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:26.583
I get it. but how can we build
a platform on hollow. empty pillars?

386
00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:28.125
I never said empty.

387
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:30.625
Once they're in the right spot.

388
00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:32.208
we open up one end.

389
00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:34.000
and what happens?

390
00:26:34.083 --> 00:26:35.291
It fills with water.

391
00:26:36.583 --> 00:26:38.208
and it sinks to the bottom.

392
00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:40.875
We'll build the island
with filled pillars.

393
00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:42.958
but filled with water.

394
00:26:54.208 --> 00:26:56.166
I'll pay you back for the pillars.

395
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.666
Don't worry.
For 700.000. I won't go hungry.

396
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:01.750
What. 700.000 lire?

397
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:05.416
Where did you get all that money?

398
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.125
I usually steal it from my father's safe.

399
00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:12.291
-Doesn't he notice?
-Of course he does. It's 700.000 lire.

400
00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:15.166
I blame the Calabrians who work for him.

401
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.750
He reports them. or he fires them.
I'm not sure.

402
00:27:17.833 --> 00:27:20.416
I think this is it. here.
Turn off the engine!

403
00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:26.791
Here we are.

404
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:29.708
If my calculations are correct.

405
00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:31.833
from this point on.

406
00:27:32.416 --> 00:27:34.458
we are outside territorial waters.

407
00:27:35.666 --> 00:27:37.583
We're no longer in Italy. Maurizio.

408
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:40.500
We're in international waters.

409
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.291
No one's in charge here!

410
00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:48.125
Nobody can tell us what to do.

411
00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:51.375
what not to do.
and stuff like that. Maurizio.

412
00:27:52.083 --> 00:27:53.250
We're free!

413
00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:54.791
Maurizio!

414
00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:56.666
Maurizio.

415
00:27:58.041 --> 00:27:59.583
Hey. Maurizio.

416
00:28:00.875 --> 00:28:01.791
Listen…

417
00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:03.750
now comes the tricky part.

418
00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:06.791
-I know.
-We need to unplug the tubes.

419
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:10.791
It's one thing doing it in a bathtub.
and quite another on the open sea.

420
00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:13.958
Remember. lift up the slider.

421
00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:16.375
and get away as quickly as you can.

422
00:28:16.458 --> 00:28:21.041
-I got it. You told me a million times!
-Because it's dangerous.

423
00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:24.541
Can't you smell the freedom?

424
00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:29.708
Not really. Maurizio.
I can only smell some cheap herbal liquor.

425
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:31.791
You're already drunk at 8 a.m.?

426
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:33.500
Did you think I could do this sober?

427
00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:36.708
I can't believe this.

428
00:28:38.458 --> 00:28:39.333
By the way.

429
00:28:40.125 --> 00:28:41.208
it's peach grappa.

430
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.875
I see.

431
00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:48.750
Come on.

432
00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:50.416
You go. man!

433
00:28:50.958 --> 00:28:52.041
Be careful!

434
00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:55.291
It's all in your hands now!

435
00:28:56.458 --> 00:28:57.625
All in your hands!

436
00:28:58.958 --> 00:28:59.791
Remember.

437
00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:02.625
Remember. move away immediately.

438
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:07.291
Keep in mind all the steps.

439
00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:09.083
Open the slider and get out of the way!

440
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:11.500
Move away immediately. Okay?

441
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.666
Do you hear me. Maurizio?

442
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:15.875
Can you hear me?

443
00:29:20.875 --> 00:29:21.833
Can you hear me?

444
00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:24.500
Of course not.

445
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.333
It's working!

446
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:45.083
No. Maurizio!

447
00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:48.875
Why didn't you listen to me?
I told you to move away immediately!

448
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:51.333
He never listens!
He has to do things his way!

449
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:53.750
Look what's happened to him now!

450
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:57.750
Now I'm stranded here on the boat.
in the middle of the sea!

451
00:29:57.833 --> 00:29:59.333
Well done!

452
00:30:07.583 --> 00:30:08.791
It works!

453
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:12.208
It works!

454
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:16.416
It's the best day of my life!
I want to do it again! Come on!

455
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:26.833
So you two transported some pillars.

456
00:30:26.916 --> 00:30:31.375
installed them on the seabed.
built a 400-square-meter platform

457
00:30:32.166 --> 00:30:33.708
and nobody said anything?

458
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:34.708
That's correct.

459
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.958
Not until we got the drill.

460
00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:40.583
The drill?

461
00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:42.416
Yes.

462
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.125
To look for drinking water.

463
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:48.166
To be an independent island.
you need to have your own water.

464
00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:50.500
So we had to drill.

465
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.583
Can't we turn this drill off?
It's been three days. It's driving me mad!

466
00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:01.958
Maurizio. water is essential!

467
00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:04.708
If you're worried
about the cost of the drill.

468
00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:09.291
we'll have to budget better.
counting the workers and all that.

469
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:12.541
Come on!
We're not really going to pay them!

470
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:14.541
They're actually grateful to us.

471
00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:18.708
They were this close to jail.
They stole millions from my dad's safe!

472
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:21.125
Wasn't that you?

473
00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:23.708
Not according to the prosecutor in Rimini.

474
00:31:24.458 --> 00:31:25.291
Right.

475
00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:31.041
What a pain. Turn it off for a second.
And then we'll turn it back on.

476
00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:33.958
You can't just flip a switch.

477
00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:35.500
It's not a toaster.

478
00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:37.333
Coastguard to…

479
00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:40.291
unidentified island.

480
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:46.625
You're required to identify yourselves.
and to immediately cease all activities.

481
00:31:46.708 --> 00:31:49.916
No. we can't turn it off just like that.
There's no switch!

482
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.125
Last warning.

483
00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:53.916
The illegal occupation of public airwaves

484
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.875
is a criminal offense punishable
with immediate detention if in flagrante.

485
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:00.708
-Public airways?
-He doesn't get it. Let me talk to him.

486
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.166
This is not…

487
00:32:02.666 --> 00:32:06.666
a toaster that you can switch on and off.
And we're in international waters!

488
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.958
And most importantly.
we're not a radio. We're not.

489
00:32:10.041 --> 00:32:11.041
No!

490
00:32:11.125 --> 00:32:13.458
He thinks the drill
is a transmitting antenna.

491
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:16.958
We're not transmitting.
We don't use airwaves. It's just a drill.

492
00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:19.500
We're looking for water.

493
00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:22.333
We're looking for water.

494
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:24.333
Did he say they're looking for water?

495
00:32:24.416 --> 00:32:25.500
Did he understand?

496
00:32:26.583 --> 00:32:27.541
What do they mean?

497
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:33.083
Why are you looking for water
in the middle of the sea?

498
00:32:35.666 --> 00:32:36.875
Well. because…

499
00:32:38.541 --> 00:32:40.666
To create an independent state.

500
00:32:41.416 --> 00:32:45.000
An independent state
with or without radio?

501
00:32:45.083 --> 00:32:46.875
Without radio!

502
00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:49.125
A state without radio.

503
00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:50.791
Perfect.

504
00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:53.666
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day!

505
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.750
You too.

506
00:33:31.875 --> 00:33:33.666
-More water?
-I'm okay. thanks.

507
00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:37.750
Let's go
and take the Calabrians back to shore.

508
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.916
You know what?

509
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:45.250
I think I might stay here.

510
00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:47.000
Here where?

511
00:33:47.083 --> 00:33:48.250
Here. on the island.

512
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.250
We have everything.

513
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.916
We have water. coffee. We have everything.

514
00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:56.541
And it's a beautiful. sunny day.

515
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.750
I'll spend my first night here.

516
00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:00.291
Are you sure?

517
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:04.166
Why did we build an island
if we're not going to stay on it?

518
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.583
I'm definitely sure.

519
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.000
Anyway…

520
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.208
it's beautiful!

521
00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:16.875
Shit. This is incredible.

522
00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:25.541
Thank you. Maurizio.

523
00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:28.500
Thank you.

524
00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:37.791
Listen. better not to hug
in front of the Calabrians.

525
00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.041
Do you mind?

526
00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:41.625
Yes. sure. You're right. Sorry.

527
00:36:55.583 --> 00:36:56.541
Hey!

528
00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:06.583
Hey!

529
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:09.000
What is that?

530
00:37:09.083 --> 00:37:14.041
This is a free and independent island!
We even have drinking water--

531
00:37:14.125 --> 00:37:17.750
Okay. you can tell me later!
Help me up. please!

532
00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:20.333
Pietro Bernardini.

533
00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:25.583
Officially. a welder.
He'd been living on his boat for months.

534
00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:30.958
and he became
the first resident of the island.

535
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.958
-Was the first resident really a castaway?
-Yes.

536
00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:40.875
There appears to be another resident too.
A stateless man of German origin

537
00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:42.083
whose name is…

538
00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:46.666
whose name is…

539
00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:49.083
Neumann.

540
00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:52.166
Wolfgang Rudy Neumann.

541
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.833
Correct.

542
00:37:54.916 --> 00:37:57.541
Wolfgang Rudy Neumann.

543
00:38:07.416 --> 00:38:12.416
Legend has it that in 1943.
Neumann was forced to join the army

544
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.125
and was sent to Rimini
to defend the Gothic Line.

545
00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:16.833
But as soon as he saw the beach.

546
00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:19.125
he knew what he wanted to do
with his life.

547
00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:22.791
Without even thinking about it.
one night he runs away from his camp

548
00:38:22.875 --> 00:38:25.958
and goes to the town hall
to ask for a beach concession.

549
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:29.916
This is how the legend
of Wolfgang Rudy Neumann was born.

550
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.291
the greatest promoter
on the Romagna Riviera.

551
00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:43.791
Rudy! Come here!

552
00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:48.583
But at the end of the war.
he was charged with desertion

553
00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:52.000
and his German citizenship was revoked.

554
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.833
Yes. Peppe?

555
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:56.333
Did I ever tell you
what my father did for a living?

556
00:38:56.416 --> 00:38:59.416
-No. Peppe. You didn't.
-He was a buffalo farmer.

557
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.000
And guess what buffalo smells of?

558
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.083
Cows?

559
00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:04.333
Shit.

560
00:39:05.041 --> 00:39:07.708
I went to the toilet earlier.
and I was almost moved.

561
00:39:07.791 --> 00:39:10.708
It reminded me of my childhood.

562
00:39:10.791 --> 00:39:14.791
How many times do I have to tell you
you need to check them every 20 minutes.

563
00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:18.875
and clean the shit off the floor.
off the walls. off the sink.

564
00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:20.166
and off the toilet seats?

565
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.750
Why do I have to do that?

566
00:39:21.833 --> 00:39:24.625
Who's bringing
all these people who shit here?

567
00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:27.750
That's what I do. bring people to clubs.
That's what you pay me for.

568
00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:30.458
No. I pay you because I'm a benefactor.

569
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:33.666
If you don't like it.
why don't you open your own beach club?

570
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.458
You know why. They only give permits
to Italian citizens.

571
00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:38.708
Open one in Germany then.

572
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:41.000
I'm not a German citizen either.

573
00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:43.791
So. buddy. off you go then.

574
00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:53.833
Did you hear they're building
an island off Rimini?

575
00:39:53.916 --> 00:39:55.291
They're building an island?

576
00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:58.458
Yeah. some crazy guy from Bologna.
It's absurd.

577
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:00.750
What do they plan to do with it?

578
00:40:00.833 --> 00:40:05.166
It's outside territorial waters.
you can do what you want. apparently.

579
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.666
I tell you what.
we can party big time there.

580
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.750
A round of applause to the best promoter
on our Riviera. Rudy Neumann!

581
00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:18.750
-I mean. you built all this by yourselves?
-Yes. we did.

582
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:21.541
Why the hell did you do that?

583
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.916
For the same reason
a dog licks his own balls.

584
00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:29.333
I don't get it.

585
00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:32.125
Because he can.

586
00:40:34.583 --> 00:40:35.416
What do you mean?

587
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.250
A dog licks his own balls because he can.

588
00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:42.041
We are engineers.
we wanted to build an island.

589
00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:44.250
we could do it. so we did it.

590
00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:48.416
I don't get the balls thing.
you lick your own balls--

591
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.250
No. we don't lick our balls.

592
00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:53.708
It was a way of saying
we wanted to create our own world

593
00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:57.166
where we'd feel really free.
and we did it. We built it.

594
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.833
Is that a naked man shaving?

595
00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:02.041
Yes. his name is Pietro. He lives here.

596
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:04.041
On the island?

597
00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:07.625
Yes. he's a castaway.
He's not much of a talker but…

598
00:41:07.708 --> 00:41:11.541
I can only count three things here though.
A semi-deserted island.

599
00:41:11.625 --> 00:41:14.791
water that's almost fresh.
and a half-naked castaway.

600
00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:16.291
Not much of a free. new world.

601
00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:19.125
Wait a minute.
I can count three things too.

602
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:23.375
A German deserter.
a promoter that nobody knows. and--

603
00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:27.583
I can't even think of a third one.
This guy comes in criticizing--

604
00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:30.333
You don't do that.
We don't have to welcome everyone.

605
00:41:30.416 --> 00:41:32.666
These are the people
we should be welcoming.

606
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.208
Castaways. deserters…

607
00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:37.583
Here no one really cares
who you are or where you're from.

608
00:41:37.666 --> 00:41:40.416
He says this now.
but he did all this for a girl.

609
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.916
-No. I didn't.
-Yes. you did.

610
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.833
Does this place have a name?

611
00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:50.458
BOAT TRIP TO THE NEW STEEL ISLAND

612
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:53.541
DEPARTS 10:30 EVERY MORNING
RETURNS 17:45

613
00:42:04.666 --> 00:42:06.958
With Rudy Neumann. everything changed.

614
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:10.291
It was an incredible and instant success.

615
00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:18.916
Rumors about a free. independent state
spread like wildfire.

616
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.791
First along the Romagna Riviera.

617
00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:23.375
then all across Italy.

618
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:25.875
In the end.
people were arriving from all over Europe.

619
00:42:25.958 --> 00:42:30.000
to see for themselves
what sounded like a miracle.

620
00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:46.083
And it also happened at the perfect time.

621
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:52.166
That was a year that made history.

622
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.458
And that everyone recalls
just by the last two numbers.

623
00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:57.500
six and eight.

624
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.458
We didn't know much
about the French riots of that May.

625
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.291
Except that they took to the streets
and set Paris on fire.

626
00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:16.041
calling for a better world.

627
00:43:16.125 --> 00:43:20.583
As for us. we actually built
that "better world" ourselves.

628
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:24.125
Today. May 1st. 1968.

629
00:43:24.208 --> 00:43:27.583
five hundred meters
outside territorial waters.

630
00:43:27.666 --> 00:43:31.708
free from everything.
we're making history!

631
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:36.500
Here. you are truly free!

632
00:43:39.333 --> 00:43:42.083
Welcome to Rose Island!

633
00:43:55.416 --> 00:43:56.708
We need a language.

634
00:43:58.333 --> 00:43:59.333
What do you mean?

635
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:01.708
People come from all over Europe.

636
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:04.375
We need an official language
that's not Italian

637
00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:06.875
and not from another country.

638
00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:09.333
A free international language.

639
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I don't think it exists. unfortunately.

640
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:14.791
I believe it does.

641
00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:18.791
ROSE ISLAND

642
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:29.958
THE MYSTERY OF THE ISLAND
REVEALED IN RIMINI

643
00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:31.791
THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IS ESPERANTO

644
00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:35.583
For the press. we were
more important than national politics.

645
00:44:35.666 --> 00:44:39.333
than student riots.
and even the Vietnam War.

646
00:44:39.416 --> 00:44:42.208
ROSE ISLAND
RUDY NEUMANN TO BE THE NEW PROMOTER

647
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:29.875
Shit.

648
00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:41.875
Are you leaving?

649
00:45:41.958 --> 00:45:43.500
Yes. I'm pregnant.

650
00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:45.416
Pregnant?

651
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.916
What do you mean "pregnant"?

652
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.916
Oh my God. how do I tell my mother?

653
00:45:51.416 --> 00:45:54.791
It's not yours. idiot.
We only met last night.

654
00:45:58.333 --> 00:45:59.291
Here.

655
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:03.500
-Pietro. did you only get Cynar?
-People love Cynar.

656
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.541
Okay. no doubt about that.
but they might want something else too.

657
00:46:08.625 --> 00:46:09.875
Can you hurry up?

658
00:46:09.958 --> 00:46:12.875
I heard from the pier.
they're expecting it to be packed today.

659
00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:15.833
-How's it going with the bar?
-He only got Cynar.

660
00:46:15.916 --> 00:46:18.500
-I think people really love Cynar.
-Maurizio?

661
00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:21.125
Weren't you meant
to go shopping with him?

662
00:46:21.208 --> 00:46:23.791
I'm only marginally involved
in this project.

663
00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:26.458
Please. don't start again
with the name story.

664
00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:28.208
Yes. I will.

665
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:30.875
Because it was a beautiful
and elegant name.

666
00:46:30.958 --> 00:46:34.375
"Maurizio and Giorgio's island"
wasn't beautiful nor elegant.

667
00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:37.333
Yes. it was.
There's a girl staring at you.

668
00:46:40.666 --> 00:46:41.500
Oh. God.

669
00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:44.875
One of you must go and talk to her.

670
00:46:44.958 --> 00:46:47.083
-Tell her I died in Vietnam.
-Hi.

671
00:46:47.166 --> 00:46:49.833
Hi! Nice to see you. What a surprise!

672
00:46:49.916 --> 00:46:51.083
I'm pregnant.

673
00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:56.291
I have a certificate of sterility
issued during the war certifying that--

674
00:46:56.375 --> 00:46:58.500
Look. I'm not sure it's yours.

675
00:47:00.041 --> 00:47:00.958
What do you mean?

676
00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:03.125
Well. there are several options.

677
00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:05.083
That's not nice.

678
00:47:05.166 --> 00:47:07.541
A girl shouldn't really go around saying--

679
00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:10.458
I've heard this place is amazing
but the bar sucks.

680
00:47:11.083 --> 00:47:14.083
I need a job. And it looks like
you need a bar attendant.

681
00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:48.541
-Get up.
-What?

682
00:47:48.625 --> 00:47:50.125
Come on. get up!

683
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.416
It's getting worse by the minute here.

684
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.583
The German's getting people to sign up
for an end-of-summer water-ski race.

685
00:47:59.666 --> 00:48:03.625
Do you think that's normal?
Was this the great idea we had?

686
00:48:03.708 --> 00:48:06.708
Because if you're talking of a free world.
I have a different view.

687
00:48:06.791 --> 00:48:07.750
And what's that?

688
00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:10.083
A big poker tournament.

689
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:11.625
-A gambling house?
-No!

690
00:48:11.708 --> 00:48:14.333
We'll play for shots. Shots of grappa.

691
00:48:14.416 --> 00:48:17.083
If you lose. you drink.
if you win. you drink.

692
00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:19.625
and if anyone wants to play with money.
we can't say no.

693
00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:22.208
But that's not the point.
just as long as we both agree.

694
00:48:22.291 --> 00:48:25.000
I'll stop him
before he collects money off people.

695
00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:27.291
Let's talk about it later. Maurizio!

696
00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:28.666
Hey!

697
00:48:53.708 --> 00:48:55.833
That's the thing they do most often.

698
00:48:56.583 --> 00:48:59.916
They throw their clothes away.
shirts. ties. everything.

699
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.375
Not sure why. but many of them do that.

700
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:06.041
Is that your girlfriend?

701
00:49:06.916 --> 00:49:07.750
Who?

702
00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:11.083
That one there. the bar attendant.

703
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.416
Come on! She's pregnant.

704
00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:15.166
Is it yours?

705
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.666
What? No!
She doesn't know whose baby it is.

706
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:23.125
She doesn't care.
She said there were a few options.

707
00:49:23.208 --> 00:49:29.083
She symbolizes this place.
a young. free-spirited. pregnant girl.

708
00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:33.041
She wouldn't have found
a job on the mainland. but here…

709
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:38.416
You know. I'm happy to see you.
I knew you'd come sooner or later.

710
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.416
-Everyone's talking about it in Rimini.
-You should see this place at night.

711
00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:44.083
You'd love it.

712
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.375
Are you staying tonight?

713
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.500
I'm getting married soon. Giorgio.

714
00:49:53.208 --> 00:49:54.041
Married?

715
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:56.666
Come on!

716
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.666
You don't want to get married.

717
00:49:59.208 --> 00:50:02.625
You belong in this world
more than anyone else.

718
00:50:04.416 --> 00:50:07.166
I'm not sure this qualifies
as a world. Giorgio.

719
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:11.291
It's more like a disco. a beach club.

720
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.791
It's not a disco.
It's an independent state.

721
00:50:15.416 --> 00:50:16.291
Free.

722
00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:18.916
We even have drinking water.

723
00:50:19.666 --> 00:50:21.583
-We have an official language.
-Sure.

724
00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:25.000
But I see people dancing. drinking.
a cute girl bartender.

725
00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:27.083
and it looks like a disco. That's all.

726
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:29.708
With the name in Esperanto.

727
00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:32.541
It looks like that to you.

728
00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:37.875
Right. Giorgio. I'm sorry but…

729
00:50:37.958 --> 00:50:38.916
I have to go.

730
00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:41.166
Take care.

731
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:55.000
Do you know how hard it is
to bring all these people out here?

732
00:50:55.083 --> 00:50:56.333
No. and you know why?

733
00:50:56.416 --> 00:50:59.083
Because it isn't hard
to bring people here!

734
00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:01.583
The hard part was building this island!

735
00:51:01.666 --> 00:51:04.583
And while we were building it.
you were cleaning toilets.

736
00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:06.291
I was the promoter there.

737
00:51:06.375 --> 00:51:10.791
and I quit because two kids
built a house on stilts in the sea

738
00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:13.666
and didn't know what to do with it.
I turned it into a dream place!

739
00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:16.000
It was our dream. not yours!
Don't forget that.

740
00:51:16.083 --> 00:51:19.250
I won't let you turn this place
into an illegal gambling den.

741
00:51:19.333 --> 00:51:22.750
There's nothing illegal on this island.
You need to understand that!

742
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:26.083
Water-skiing is for rich people.
You can do it anywhere.

743
00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:28.583
But poker's something
you can only do here.

744
00:51:28.666 --> 00:51:31.625
-Because it's a crime in the real world!
-Correct! But not here.

745
00:51:31.708 --> 00:51:33.375
That's why we built an island.

746
00:51:33.458 --> 00:51:36.750
-Giorgio. back me up here.
-We built a disco.

747
00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:38.833
We did what?

748
00:51:38.916 --> 00:51:43.375
We built our little. free world.
on our happy island…

749
00:51:43.458 --> 00:51:45.750
But what's all this for.

750
00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:49.291
if they don't recognize us
as an independent state?

751
00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:50.958
Who's "they"?

752
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:54.958
Italy. Europe. the other states. Who else?

753
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:58.833
I disagree with that.
Who cares if they recognize us or not?

754
00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:02.041
If we wanted a state.
we'd have rules. and we don't want that.

755
00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:03.416
If they don't recognize us.

756
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.916
we'll just be a disco
in the middle of the sea.

757
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.458
We already have everything.
We have currency. we have stamps.

758
00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:10.875
we have a postal service.

759
00:52:10.958 --> 00:52:12.333
The only thing missing…

760
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.708
is a government.

761
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.041
But we are the government.

762
00:52:18.208 --> 00:52:19.541
I'll be the president.

763
00:52:20.083 --> 00:52:22.208
Franca. the minister for economic affairs.

764
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:24.166
Pietro. surveillance and defense.

765
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.041
What's a surveillance ministry?

766
00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:28.750
I said "surveillance and defense"
for a reason.

767
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:31.583
You're the caretaker.
you oversee rather than defend.

768
00:52:32.208 --> 00:52:34.541
Rudy. secretary of state.
Maurizio. internal affairs.

769
00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:38.458
-I'm not sure that's a good idea.
-Maurizio's right. It'll piss them off.

770
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:39.375
So what?

771
00:52:39.916 --> 00:52:41.375
I feel like a minister.

772
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:45.666
I wonder how my folks will react.
I usually give them bad news.

773
00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:48.083
How exactly are we doing this?

774
00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:25.833
UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS

775
00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:56.500
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS

776
00:54:56.583 --> 00:54:59.333
The idea is to increase
and strategically relocate

777
00:54:59.416 --> 00:55:01.958
the military trucks in key spots

778
00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:04.750
to send out a strong message.

779
00:55:04.833 --> 00:55:08.250
Using the summertime to regain control
over the occupied universities.

780
00:55:08.833 --> 00:55:10.250
Basically all of them. except one.

781
00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:12.375
Only one left? Which one?

782
00:55:12.458 --> 00:55:13.583
Luigi.

783
00:55:13.666 --> 00:55:15.208
the military trucks again?

784
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:18.333
I know. Giovanni. but if you've noticed.

785
00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:22.083
the students who went to lessons
and respected the teachers six months ago.

786
00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:25.291
have suddenly turned into a mob
driven by hatred and violence.

787
00:55:25.375 --> 00:55:28.583
Clearly. pollution is to blame.

788
00:55:28.666 --> 00:55:32.000
excessive protein intake. and TV.

789
00:55:32.583 --> 00:55:36.500
I happened to watch TV last night.
and it was all about dismemberment.

790
00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:38.500
monsters. people copulating.

791
00:55:38.583 --> 00:55:41.208
All this on the main channel.
Is that acceptable?

792
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:43.083
You must have watched The Odyssey.

793
00:55:43.166 --> 00:55:44.708
The Odyssey?

794
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:46.958
Maybe. I fell asleep halfway through.

795
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:48.625
Okay. then…

796
00:55:49.125 --> 00:55:50.791
let's go ahead with the outposts.

797
00:55:50.875 --> 00:55:54.250
If there are no other urgent matters.
we'll update on Thursday.

798
00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:55.791
Thank you.

799
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:03.125
Actually. Giovanni.
talking about young people.

800
00:56:03.708 --> 00:56:05.166
there is one thing…

801
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.500
Forget it. we'll talk about it next time.
Don't worry.

802
00:56:08.583 --> 00:56:09.583
Tell me. Franco.

803
00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:14.041
We'll talk about it next time.
Don't worry. it's not important.

804
00:56:14.125 --> 00:56:17.458
Even better.
Just tell us and we can go for lunch.

805
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:19.875
It's nothing…

806
00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:21.958
Basically. what's happening is…

807
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:27.166
there's this guy.
with some friends in Rimini.

808
00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:29.083
It's nothing really…

809
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:33.083
Five hundred meters
outside of territorial waters.

810
00:56:33.833 --> 00:56:36.166
so just off Rimini.

811
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:37.458
What did he do?

812
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.666
He built an island.

813
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.083
and declared independence.

814
00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:47.208
I didn't get that. Say it again.

815
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:49.916
It's nothing. Giovanni.
it's no big deal. I told you.

816
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.916
In fact. while telling you
and hearing myself saying it.

817
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.708
I actually realized

818
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:57.875
that it sounds more serious
than it really is.

819
00:56:57.958 --> 00:57:02.500
Some guys in Rimini.
500 meters outside territorial waters.

820
00:57:02.583 --> 00:57:06.291
built an island and declared independence.

821
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.958
Independence from whom?

822
00:57:19.041 --> 00:57:22.875
From Italy. I believe. From everyone.
They're independent…

823
00:57:23.875 --> 00:57:28.625
An island. though from what I gather.
it's more like a platform.

824
00:57:28.708 --> 00:57:29.958
"From what I gather"?

825
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:34.000
Giovanni. please.
let's not make a drama out of nothing.

826
00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.791
-And how did they build this platform?
-I don't know.

827
00:57:36.875 --> 00:57:38.541
-And how long did it take?
-Giovanni--

828
00:57:38.625 --> 00:57:40.750
-How long did it take?
-I don't know.

829
00:57:40.833 --> 00:57:44.666
An adequate amount of time
necessary to build something like that.

830
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:46.958
Why are we just finding out about it?

831
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:49.291
Maybe because the local authority.

832
00:57:49.375 --> 00:57:52.208
considering it's outside
territorial waters.

833
00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:54.791
might have believed it wasn't their--

834
00:57:54.875 --> 00:57:55.750
I'm sorry.

835
00:57:56.416 --> 00:57:57.708
but how did you find out?

836
00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:01.166
Well… this maybe is the only detail

837
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:06.000
that makes this seemingly
insignificant event. a little more serious

838
00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:08.250
because basically. we were told by…

839
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.500
Well. the UN called us.

840
00:58:15.708 --> 00:58:18.583
-The UN called us?
-That's why I didn't want to tell you.

841
00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:23.000
Giovanni. we're making a big fuss.
that's what we're doing. about a prank--

842
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:27.458
I'm sorry. Franco. the UN called us.
and you say it's a prank!

843
00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:29.625
Who's our man at the UN? Who's there?

844
00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:30.541
Randelli.

845
00:58:30.625 --> 00:58:31.791
Randelli died last year!

846
00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:34.291
What's the name of the officer
who called you?

847
00:58:34.375 --> 00:58:36.750
I don't think it was an officer. Giovanni.

848
00:58:36.833 --> 00:58:38.416
Good. Maybe it was a secretary.

849
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.125
Secretary. yes. I mean…

850
00:58:41.208 --> 00:58:44.125
not a secretary but the…

851
00:58:44.208 --> 00:58:46.833
Secretary-General of the United Nations.

852
00:58:49.416 --> 00:58:50.500
When did this happen?

853
00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:51.750
Two days ago.

854
00:58:51.833 --> 00:58:53.541
What the hell have you been doing
for two days?

855
00:58:53.625 --> 00:58:56.958
I immediately sent out
two of our best intelligence officers.

856
00:58:57.041 --> 00:58:58.750
Good. Where's their report?

857
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.666
We haven't heard from them…

858
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.791
for nearly 40 hours.

859
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:06.833
By law. in eight hours' time

860
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:09.583
we have to notify the families
by telegram.

861
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:20.666
Good morning. gentlemen. So…

862
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.125
-Tell me you found them.
-They're on the phone.

863
00:59:25.208 --> 00:59:27.666
-They're alive then.
-Yes. I'd say so.

864
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.208
They'll regret they are.

865
00:59:32.041 --> 00:59:38.916
Agent. I hope you have a valid explanation
for your disgraceful behavior.

866
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.333
-I cheated on my wife!
-Agent. pull yourself together.

867
00:59:42.416 --> 00:59:44.416
The situation's taken a bad turn.

868
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.625
Please. don't tell her.
I love her so much!

869
00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:50.458
-Wait!
-Minister. Agent Piazza here.

870
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:56.000
The island's inhabitants' top priority
is the custom of adding fruit to wine.

871
00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:57.375
then drinking the wine…

872
00:59:57.458 --> 01:00:01.833
Agent Piazza. it's called sangria.
In Spain. they've been doing it for ages.

873
01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:03.916
Agent Piazza. I'm fairly sure

874
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.750
that you're talking to
an Italian minister while drunk!

875
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:09.458
It's the minister.

876
01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:12.666
Return to Rome immediately
with a detailed report.

877
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:17.708
Or you will have to face a court-martial
with accusations of high treason.

878
01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.500
After foreign affairs. onto lifestyle.

879
01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:37.458
Or rather. we're still on foreign affairs
but we'll focus on the "life in style."

880
01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:41.958
That fun play on words
is the perfect introduction

881
01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:46.666
to what seems to have become
the main attraction on Rimini's shores.

882
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.208
Rose Island.

883
01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:54.541
The founder. Giorgio Rosa.
talks about utopia and freedom.

884
01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:57.708
But what is being hidden on the island?

885
01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:58.875
Drugs?

886
01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:00.666
Moral degeneration?

887
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:02.041
Gambling?

888
01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:05.916
We talk to Franco Restivo.
Minister of Internal Affairs.

889
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.250
This so-called Rose Island.

890
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:16.500
absolutely cannot and should not
be considered as an independent state.

891
01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:18.833
Is it true that the UN
has started an investigation

892
01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:22.000
on the basis that there might be grounds
for a claim for independence?

893
01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:26.250
No. That investigation
does not concern us.

894
01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:32.583
The Italian State will absolutely
not tolerate a lawless platform

895
01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:36.291
where the safety of our citizens
cannot be guaranteed.

896
01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:40.083
They may be in international waters.
but they are Italian citizens.

897
01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:43.583
and their safety is our main concern.

898
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:49.125
What's this?

899
01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:51.458
Letters. Applications for citizenship.

900
01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.875
The minister has unwillingly
put us on the map.

901
01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:56.916
The requests come from all over the world!

902
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.625
Now everyone knows who we are.

903
01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:01.291
And they want to become citizens
of Rose Island.

904
01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:14.541
-God bless the president!
-Come on. get up.

905
01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:16.333
-You're amazing!
-Thanks.

906
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.666
So how's it going?

907
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.375
Sorry I'm late.

908
01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:23.958
President?

909
01:02:24.458 --> 01:02:27.750
Yes. Dad. but they're hippies.
They're over the top.

910
01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:31.458
-Have you ordered yet?
-We were waiting for you.

911
01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:33.208
Okay. here I am. Waiter!

912
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.791
What's fresh today?

913
01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:38.250
Our usual catch of the day.

914
01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:41.083
and a fantastic lobster
that can be served a number of ways.

915
01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:43.666
Great! Lobster for everybody?

916
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.750
Half a portion of tagliolini.

917
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:50.458
Half a portion of tagliolini? Dad?

918
01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:52.625
Yes. half a portion of tagliolini.

919
01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:56.000
Don't worry about money. you're my guests.

920
01:02:56.083 --> 01:02:58.416
-Half a portion--
-He'd like half a portion of tagliolini.

921
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.750
So two lobsters
and half a portion of tagliolini.

922
01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:04.166
Good. Thank you.

923
01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:07.708
-Thanks. You look good. Mom.
-Thanks.

924
01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:08.875
Is it legal. Giorgio?

925
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:12.375
The money you're earning. is it legal?

926
01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:14.833
What do you mean legal?

927
01:03:16.041 --> 01:03:19.916
We're an independent state.
close to being recognized by the UN.

928
01:03:20.916 --> 01:03:22.583
we get to decide what is legal.

929
01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:24.833
Nobody gets to say
what is legal for themselves.

930
01:03:24.916 --> 01:03:26.875
Dad. we're doing nothing wrong.

931
01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:29.916
Don't believe the newspapers.

932
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.583
Why don't you come after lunch?

933
01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:34.500
It's just 20 minutes by boat.

934
01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:37.125
We can go together.
and you can see what we do.

935
01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:42.708
Did I tell you I patented
a telescopic pillar system to build it?

936
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:44.416
You'd love it.

937
01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:46.750
Are you coming?

938
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:51.166
Your mom has a nap after lunch.
we'd better not.

939
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:01.583
Okay.

940
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:03.583
Maybe another time.

941
01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:29.875
Aren't your folks coming?

942
01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:33.333
My mom needs a rest after lunch.

943
01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.458
Don't take it personally.

944
01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:38.416
It's hard for them to understand
what we're doing.

945
01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:44.583
Mr. Rosa. right?

946
01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:47.041
We're about to leave. We're in a hurry.

947
01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:47.958
Yes. that's me.

948
01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:51.166
You need to talk to
our foreign relations representative.

949
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:52.916
Mr. Rosa. we need to talk to you.

950
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.125
-I was just saying that you need to--
-That's okay.

951
01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:58.958
Let's go.

952
01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:01.041
Meet me at the boat. I'll be right back.

953
01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:05.625
Mr. Rosa. do you know who we are?

954
01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:09.208
-Funeral service?
-We're from the Secret Service.

955
01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.250
I know. It was a joke.

956
01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:14.208
Haven't we met before?

957
01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:17.041
I've spent about 40 hours on the island.

958
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.375
I remember.
you're the one who lost his pinkie.

959
01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:20.916
Not really.

960
01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:24.291
I didn't actually bet my pinkie.

961
01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:27.208
It was a memorable game!

962
01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:31.166
You must immediately cease
all activities on the island.

963
01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.125
Which activities?

964
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:37.583
Our report suggests
that you have a bar managed by a minor.

965
01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.541
and you host card games.

966
01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:41.041
So what?

967
01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:44.375
Aren't those men
playing cards in a bar too?

968
01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:46.000
Why can't we do it?

969
01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:50.166
It's different what happens here
under the watchful eye of the authorities.

970
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:53.083
Oh. I see! It's about "the watchful eye."

971
01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:56.250
Listen. Giorgio.
what the major is trying to say

972
01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:59.166
is that we appreciate
your sociological experiment.

973
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.625
but as with all experiments.
it must end now.

974
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.416
What must end?

975
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Beach clubs permits are being renewed
at the end of the month.

976
01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:08.666
And the major here has power of attorney.

977
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.583
See this briefcase?

978
01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:13.541
It contains papers
which guarantee that you.

979
01:06:13.625 --> 01:06:16.125
who's sitting here owning nothing.

980
01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:18.750
end up with two beach clubs
of your choice.

981
01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:23.250
It'd set you up
for the next three generations.

982
01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:26.416
You said it yourself.
you do the same things there.

983
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.041
bar. card games…
You just do it here and not on the sea.

984
01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:30.458
What's the difference?

985
01:06:30.541 --> 01:06:33.833
None. except for the permits
we'll give you.

986
01:06:33.916 --> 01:06:36.791
You might say.
"I don't pay goddamn taxes there."

987
01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:40.125
Do you think anyone does here?
Come on. Giorgio.

988
01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:50.208
What the hell…

989
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:54.166
This is serious. you know!

990
01:06:56.041 --> 01:06:58.666
I'm trying to save your goddamn island!

991
01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:03.250
Attention. please. everyone.

992
01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:05.416
Mr. President. may I say it?

993
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.583
As you wish.

994
01:07:06.666 --> 01:07:10.125
Okay. As you know. tonight.
we kept the island to ourselves

995
01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:12.083
for a special Council of Ministers.

996
01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:14.583
as special as the news
I'm about to give you.

997
01:07:14.666 --> 01:07:19.166
Our President. Giorgio Rosa.
has finally agreed.

998
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:22.708
that from tomorrow the island
will officially be able to grant

999
01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:24.916
citizenship to all applicants.

1000
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:28.625
What are you clapping for?
That wasn't the news. Stop!

1001
01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:32.583
That wasn't the news.
just an official communication.

1002
01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:37.958
The real news is
that we have printed the first passport.

1003
01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:40.791
and we have agreed to assign it

1004
01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:43.541
to the one among us
who has never owned one. So…

1005
01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:46.500
Rudy. this is for you.

1006
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.208
Now. this calls for a round of applause.
Come on. guys!

1007
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:54.500
-Well done. Neumann!
-GIve me a hug.

1008
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:07.250
We're hoping that
with the increased military presence.

1009
01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.833
things will settle.

1010
01:08:08.916 --> 01:08:11.208
We're hoping
to regain control of the universities.

1011
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:13.125
since there's only one left.

1012
01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:15.666
I know. These are hard times.

1013
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:19.166
But you shouldn't worry.
you're doing a great job.

1014
01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:23.083
and we're all very happy here.

1015
01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:24.583
Thank you. Emanuele.

1016
01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.041
Well. Giovanni.

1017
01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:29.541
I'll see you again in two weeks. as usual.

1018
01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:32.541
-Sure.
-Try to rest a little.

1019
01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:35.583
You're looking a little gray.

1020
01:08:35.666 --> 01:08:38.000
I could really do with a vacation.

1021
01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:42.625
Don't forget this.

1022
01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:44.791
Excuse me. Giovanni.

1023
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:48.500
since you're here.
there's something I'd like to mention.

1024
01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:53.791
Especially considering the exposure
that it's getting in the tabloids.

1025
01:08:53.875 --> 01:08:56.125
ROSE ISLAND
A SMALL STATE OFF RIMINI

1026
01:08:56.833 --> 01:08:58.916
Look. Emanuele. we're working on it.

1027
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.916
I'm sure you are. but times have changed.

1028
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.958
I used to be able to filter the news.

1029
01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:09.916
but now our Holy Father
wants to be informed first-hand.

1030
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.958
He reads all the papers
first thing in the morning.

1031
01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:18.000
I caught this one
and removed it from the stack.

1032
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.166
but had he seen this.
it would've gotten ugly.

1033
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.583
Giovanni.

1034
01:09:23.458 --> 01:09:24.625
this is a bare ass.

1035
01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:27.916
Do you get it. Giovanni.
an ass in the newspaper.

1036
01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:30.958
You tell me if you think this is okay.

1037
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:34.291
Of course not. but my dear Emanuele.

1038
01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:37.500
we don't really want
to start a case about an ass.

1039
01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:39.000
It's not about the ass itself.

1040
01:09:39.083 --> 01:09:43.916
which I think is well-proportioned. nice.
but what the ass represents.

1041
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.916
An ass on an island where.
from what I gather.

1042
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.916
you can do what you want.

1043
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.916
Do you get it. Giovanni?
An ass and everything you want.

1044
01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:55.916
Giovanni.

1045
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.041
with an ass. can you do anything you want?

1046
01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:05.333
No. I'll tell you. You can't.

1047
01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:09.041
Otherwise. this country
would be out of our control.

1048
01:10:09.666 --> 01:10:10.500
Sure.

1049
01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:17.375
The truth is.
they're outside our territorial waters.

1050
01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:21.666
-So outside of our jurisdiction.
-Like I said. it's just a small issue.

1051
01:10:50.416 --> 01:10:51.500
Where's Franco?

1052
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.708
What the hell are these?

1053
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:03.541
My dear Giovanni. I wasn't expecting you.

1054
01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:06.041
Had you told me.
we could have met at the cafe.

1055
01:11:06.125 --> 01:11:08.458
It's so messy here.

1056
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.500
-What the hell are these letters?
-Nothing…

1057
01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:13.333
Requests to relinquish
Italian nationality. Mr. President.

1058
01:11:13.416 --> 01:11:15.083
in favor of Rose Island.

1059
01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:18.958
No. not really.
I mean. it doesn't work like that.

1060
01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.416
They can't just write in
and we cancel their citizenship.

1061
01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.666
It's not a subscription to
Famiglia Cristiana that you just cancel.

1062
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:27.916
And most of the letters
are written in such poor Italian!

1063
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.750
-Don't waste--
-How many are there?

1064
01:11:29.833 --> 01:11:34.041
About 300. The German Consulate called.
and they've received about 100.

1065
01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:36.125
France 30. and the US four.

1066
01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:39.583
Just four in the States. Giovanni.
They don't give a damn about them.

1067
01:11:39.666 --> 01:11:40.958
They flopped over there.

1068
01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:44.791
Franco. I've had enough of this shit.

1069
01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:50.583
The letters. parliamentary interrogations.
asses that can't do what they want.

1070
01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:53.250
-Asses what?
-You have to fix this now.

1071
01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:56.416
Even if you have to swim there
with a screwdriver between your teeth

1072
01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.250
to unscrew that goddamn platform
bit by bit!

1073
01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:04.000
Franco. we've known
each other for 30 years.

1074
01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.916
but you've never seen me truly pissed off.

1075
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.958
Tell me you understand.

1076
01:12:10.791 --> 01:12:12.666
I understand. Giovanni. I do.

1077
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:27.833
Rosa!

1078
01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:30.416
Rosa!

1079
01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:33.458
It's Battistini.

1080
01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:35.541
He wants to talk to you.

1081
01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:16.041
Nothing. It's going to rain tomorrow too.

1082
01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:21.291
We have to start building the roof
for the second floor as soon as we can.

1083
01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:24.125
And then we have to extend the canopy.

1084
01:13:24.916 --> 01:13:26.541
Giorgio. are you listening?

1085
01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:28.125
Did you think about heating?

1086
01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:30.875
It's important.
We'll freeze to death in a month.

1087
01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.541
We have to find a solution.

1088
01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:34.875
Rudy… What do you think?

1089
01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:37.416
Well… I don't know. guys.

1090
01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:39.583
An island is a summer place.

1091
01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:42.875
In my experience.
it's hard to attract guests in the autumn.

1092
01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:46.583
What do you mean it's hard?
This is an independent state.

1093
01:13:46.666 --> 01:13:49.791
We can't shut down for the season.
We have citizens now.

1094
01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:51.791
What about you. Franca? What do you think?

1095
01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:55.333
I'm almost six months pregnant.
I don't know how much longer I can stay.

1096
01:13:55.416 --> 01:13:59.250
We've been talking about
our first natural-born citizen for months!

1097
01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:02.541
The midwife said she won't come.
She says it's too dangerous.

1098
01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:05.416
She can't be bothered. more like.

1099
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.083
-Don't worry. I'll find someone else.
-You. Pietro?

1100
01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:10.250
What are your plans?

1101
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.375
Come on.
what kind of plans can Pietro have?

1102
01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:14.291
Come on. guys.

1103
01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:18.583
Let's try to be a bit positive.
Being negative doesn't help.

1104
01:14:18.666 --> 01:14:19.708
What did they offer you?

1105
01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:20.791
So the roof--

1106
01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.333
What did you say?

1107
01:14:25.708 --> 01:14:27.125
What did they offer you?

1108
01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:39.083
Wait a minute.

1109
01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.666
am I the only one
who wasn't offered anything?

1110
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:44.625
-Enough. Maurizio.
-What do you mean "Enough. Maurizio"?

1111
01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:49.083
You knew about this and didn't tell me?
What did they offer you?

1112
01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:52.208
You're using the baby excuse.
but what did they offer you?

1113
01:14:52.291 --> 01:14:56.000
You even had the guts to make up excuses.
What were you offered?

1114
01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:27.458
-Hi. Mom.
-Hi.

1115
01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:47.125
I've never watched daytime TV.

1116
01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:49.916
I'm sorry. Dad.

1117
01:15:50.541 --> 01:15:51.583
It's my fault.

1118
01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:54.708
I didn't think they'd go this far.

1119
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.708
What did they offer you?

1120
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:05.666
Two beach clubs…

1121
01:16:07.583 --> 01:16:08.958
of my choosing.

1122
01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:11.333
Two beach clubs.

1123
01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:17.875
We made all those sacrifices
to pay for your education…

1124
01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:22.208
and now you're going to be
a beach club manager.

1125
01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:29.666
There's always a time
when you have to say yes.

1126
01:16:30.416 --> 01:16:31.291
Isn't there?

1127
01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:33.750
That's what you say.

1128
01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:44.500
They said my performance was below
the standard expected by the company.

1129
01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:48.833
I've never taken an extra day off.

1130
01:16:49.666 --> 01:16:51.791
and I haven't called in sick
in five years.

1131
01:16:53.166 --> 01:16:56.583
I've always done what I was asked to do.

1132
01:17:02.333 --> 01:17:03.416
Say no. Giorgio.

1133
01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:07.416
Say no this time too.

1134
01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:38.416
Excuse me. I'm really sorry.

1135
01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:42.083
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.

1136
01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:45.166
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1137
01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:48.375
Could you move over?

1138
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.083
Could you move over?
It's urgent. I have to… Sorry.

1139
01:17:52.958 --> 01:17:54.041
I'm really sorry.

1140
01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:56.958
Thank you. Sorry.

1141
01:17:57.541 --> 01:17:59.416
I'm really sorry. Thank you.

1142
01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.916
What are you doing here?

1143
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.041
I've been looking for you. Where were you?

1144
01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:05.375
Do you know Carlo.
the man I'm about to marry?

1145
01:18:05.458 --> 01:18:08.250
Carlo! Nice to meet you. I'm Giorgio.

1146
01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:10.375
Gabriella's told me all about you.

1147
01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:11.666
Carlo. Nice to meet you.

1148
01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:14.583
-What's up. sweetheart?
-Nothing. don't worry.

1149
01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:18.125
Listen. it's not a disco.

1150
01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:21.208
It's not a disco at all.
It's a real state. a free one.

1151
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:23.291
So real that they're now attacking us.

1152
01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:26.000
So now you have to fight my case.

1153
01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:28.708
Okay. Sorry. honey. I'll be right back.

1154
01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:30.125
Let's go.

1155
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.541
-I'm sorry. it's an urgent matter.
-Excuse us. please. Sorry.

1156
01:18:37.916 --> 01:18:40.833
You shouldn't have written to the UN.
You pissed them off.

1157
01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:44.125
I wanted to prove
that we are a free and independent state.

1158
01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:45.750
Yes. you're free geographically.

1159
01:18:45.833 --> 01:18:49.166
but an Italian citizen remains so
even outside territorial waters.

1160
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.291
Not if they choose otherwise.

1161
01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:53.958
That's why we started issuing passports.

1162
01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:55.666
That's exactly the point.

1163
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:58.708
You could be right
but they'd never admit it

1164
01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:00.583
as it could set a dangerous precedent.

1165
01:19:00.666 --> 01:19:02.958
So? Who can help me?

1166
01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:05.083
I don't know. maybe a priest.

1167
01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:09.083
Come on! There must be someone.
a judge. an agency. I don't know.

1168
01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:11.916
A bloody King Solomon
who deals with cases like these!

1169
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.208
The Council of Europe in Strasbourg
handles disputes between states.

1170
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:18.125
Perfect. let's go then.

1171
01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:19.125
Where?

1172
01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:20.208
To Strasbourg!

1173
01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:23.833
Giorgio. private citizens
cannot go to the Council of Europe.

1174
01:19:23.916 --> 01:19:27.250
But I have a state.
and I'm going with my lawyer. you.

1175
01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:29.791
International law is your field.

1176
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:33.500
I'm offering you
the adventure of a lifetime.

1177
01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:36.041
To save an independent state.

1178
01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:38.000
Will you come?

1179
01:19:40.291 --> 01:19:41.166
Giorgio…

1180
01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:52.000
Fine.

1181
01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:13.083
IMPOUNDED VEHICLE

1182
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:02.625
And so…

1183
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:04.083
I ended up here.

1184
01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:07.041
"And so I ended up here."

1185
01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:18.125
Is that all?

1186
01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:21.000
Yes.

1187
01:21:26.291 --> 01:21:27.166
Thank you.

1188
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.541
Major. accept my congratulations
on behalf of the Italian people.

1189
01:21:57.625 --> 01:21:59.333
It wasn't an easy task.

1190
01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:01.166
Thank you. Minister.

1191
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.625
How much did it cost us?

1192
01:22:04.291 --> 01:22:06.000
They're four poor souls. sir.

1193
01:22:06.083 --> 01:22:09.250
We got away with a bar.
one club permit. one passport.

1194
01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.041
and a sailing boat.

1195
01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:13.833
And what about what's his name. Orlandi?

1196
01:22:14.625 --> 01:22:16.291
Maurizio Orlandi.

1197
01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:21.041
He's an alcoholic. All he does is drink.
It's pointless talking to people like him.

1198
01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:22.958
Well done. Major.

1199
01:22:31.791 --> 01:22:33.333
Why are you whispering?

1200
01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:34.916
To avoid bothering you. sir.

1201
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.166
Whispering bothers me.
What did you tell him?

1202
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.208
Nothing important. Minister.

1203
01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:45.208
No… I don't like the face you pulled.
What did he tell you?

1204
01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:49.791
Giorgio Rosa…

1205
01:22:50.416 --> 01:22:52.000
is at the Council of Europe.

1206
01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:02.666
It doesn't mean anything. sir.

1207
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:05.583
He's just sightseeing.
They don't see private citizens.

1208
01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:10.541
The Council of Europe decided to see him
after he spent a week in the lobby.

1209
01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:15.666
They called an emergency meeting.
and Giorgio Rosa gave his version.

1210
01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:20.708
Fine.

1211
01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:37.291
It's incredible.
I don't know how you did it.

1212
01:23:37.375 --> 01:23:39.791
You told an incredible story.

1213
01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:44.041
Whatever the outcome.
this will go down in history.

1214
01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:48.125
You have no idea
what is about to happen here today.

1215
01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:49.083
Translate.

1216
01:23:49.166 --> 01:23:53.791
They will start a dossier on it.
and they will review the case. Go on.

1217
01:23:53.875 --> 01:23:57.000
Basically. the Council of Europe
will deliberate on your island.

1218
01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.000
It went well?

1219
01:23:58.083 --> 01:24:00.750
Can someone please answer the phone?

1220
01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:05.458
So. Giorgio.
you should not let your guard down.

1221
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.166
Maybe we should talk
to some legal experts.

1222
01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:10.625
Can someone answer the phone?

1223
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:13.583
Hello?

1224
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.333
Yes.

1225
01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:25.000
Mr. Tomà.

1226
01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:26.500
It's urgent.

1227
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.791
Not now. get a message. I'll call back.

1228
01:24:29.416 --> 01:24:31.958
No… It's the Italian Minister
of Internal Affairs.

1229
01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:47.333
It's not for you.

1230
01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.916
He wants to talk to Mr. Rosa.

1231
01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:22.708
Hello?

1232
01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:24.541
When I was a boy.

1233
01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:28.125
I had one passion:

1234
01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:29.875
cycling.

1235
01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.041
I was able to perfectly combine

1236
01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:35.708
my political activity
with some decent results

1237
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:38.458
in some local cycling competitions.

1238
01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:42.375
Then suddenly. I had to quit.

1239
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:48.250
In 1947. I quit cycling for good.

1240
01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:50.416
because…

1241
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.375
every God-given day.

1242
01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:57.416
myself and some 551 poor idiots.

1243
01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:00.041
had to write

1244
01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:03.583
a list of numbered sentences.

1245
01:26:04.375 --> 01:26:08.208
which would become
the foundation of this republic

1246
01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:09.750
which was about to be born.

1247
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:13.000
You have to think of everything. you know.

1248
01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:15.750
Consider all variables.

1249
01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:18.708
If you get one wrong. it all falls apart.

1250
01:26:18.791 --> 01:26:23.208
and the freedom
we had fought so hard for. will vanish.

1251
01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:27.750
Reading those little sentences today.

1252
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.833
I believe we got our odds right.

1253
01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:32.958
And you.

1254
01:26:33.583 --> 01:26:38.916
you insignificant piece of shit.

1255
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.333
would like to be the exception
to that perfect calculation?

1256
01:26:43.416 --> 01:26:47.833
You talk about freedom.
but yours is a conditional freedom.

1257
01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:50.125
Absolute freedom simply scares you.

1258
01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:54.750
You don't hate me for what I've done.
but for what I could do.

1259
01:26:55.333 --> 01:27:00.083
I'm outside territorial waters.
It doesn't concern you.

1260
01:27:00.166 --> 01:27:03.083
You act like a big man.
but then you write to the UN.

1261
01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:05.541
and you go to the Council of Europe.

1262
01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:11.208
I'd say you're not really an anarchist
if you need someone to acknowledge you.

1263
01:27:11.291 --> 01:27:14.916
You've built a 400-square-meter-platform

1264
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.541
with four idiots
and you think that's a state?

1265
01:27:19.083 --> 01:27:23.041
But you haven't got the slightest idea
of what it takes

1266
01:27:23.125 --> 01:27:25.750
to secure the freedom

1267
01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:27.083
of 40 million people.

1268
01:27:27.166 --> 01:27:30.250
I won't take lessons
from someone who had a man fired

1269
01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:33.208
after 30 years just to intimidate me!

1270
01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:36.083
Do yourself a favor. get away from there.

1271
01:27:36.166 --> 01:27:38.083
Save yourself the humiliation.

1272
01:27:38.166 --> 01:27:40.458
You're on your own.
and you haven't a hope.

1273
01:27:40.541 --> 01:27:44.458
The Council of Europe
has just agreed to examine my case.

1274
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:47.666
and the consultations
start tomorrow morning.

1275
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:52.958
Stock up with lawyers. asshole.
because this story has just started.

1276
01:27:53.041 --> 01:27:54.375
And you can't stop me.

1277
01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:56.916
All right. dickhead.

1278
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.375
You founded a state? So did I.

1279
01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:02.375
But do you know the difference
between our two states?

1280
01:28:02.458 --> 01:28:06.916
I have an arsenal that can blow up
your shitty island to pieces!

1281
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.375
Run back to Rimini quickly.

1282
01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:12.250
or you'll miss
the best fireworks you'll ever see!

1283
01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:26.333
I have to go back to Rimini.

1284
01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:29.458
The Council will meet in two days.

1285
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:32.166
There might not be an island in two days!

1286
01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:08.666
Assault squad ready in 15 minutes.

1287
01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:11.083
Instructions to follow.

1288
01:29:11.166 --> 01:29:15.375
This is not a drill.
I repeat. this is not a drill.

1289
01:29:15.458 --> 01:29:20.291
Assault squad ready in 15 minutes.
This is not a drill.

1290
01:29:29.583 --> 01:29:32.458
Let's be honest.

1291
01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:37.250
today's modern weddings always end
with a gift of "The Hunter" to the guests.

1292
01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:39.208
The one you're holding

1293
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:42.291
is the crown jewel
of the '68-'69 collection.

1294
01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:44.458
"The Hunter and his Bloodhounds."

1295
01:29:44.541 --> 01:29:48.208
We also have the basic version
without the bloodhounds.

1296
01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:50.125
Sure. it'll save you some money.

1297
01:29:51.291 --> 01:29:53.625
but it's less elegant and symbolic.

1298
01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:55.458
What shall we do. sweetheart?

1299
01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:12.666
What's this?

1300
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:15.375
It's a replica of Rose Island in silver.

1301
01:30:15.458 --> 01:30:18.416
Just a souvenir.
we sell lots of them to tourists.

1302
01:30:19.166 --> 01:30:23.750
If you like it.
we also have it in wrought iron.

1303
01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:36.833
Hello. Mom?

1304
01:30:37.583 --> 01:30:38.500
Were you sleeping?

1305
01:30:40.125 --> 01:30:43.083
Yes. sure. It's 11 p.m. I'm sorry.

1306
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.125
No. nothing.

1307
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:48.250
It was just to tell you I'm fine.

1308
01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:51.083
I'm on the freeway.
I'm coming back to Rimini.

1309
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:56.083
I've been to France.
Do you remember? For the island issue.

1310
01:30:57.041 --> 01:30:59.250
It's actually going really well.

1311
01:31:00.166 --> 01:31:02.250
Tomorrow they're going to meet to deci--

1312
01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:05.333
Yes. Mom. I ate.

1313
01:31:06.250 --> 01:31:08.333
Yes. I had a sandwich at the gas station.

1314
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:11.083
Yes. they make sandwiches.

1315
01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:13.708
They stuff them with things.

1316
01:31:15.916 --> 01:31:18.083
I'm fine. Mom. I…

1317
01:31:19.375 --> 01:31:20.708
just wanted to say hi.

1318
01:31:23.875 --> 01:31:25.208
No. don't wake him up.

1319
01:31:26.208 --> 01:31:27.250
It's fine.

1320
01:31:28.041 --> 01:31:29.041
Give him my love.

1321
01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:33.083
Bye. Mom. Goodnight.

1322
01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:05.166
Can it fit two people?

1323
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:13.291
I mean the boat. Can it fit two people?

1324
01:32:13.916 --> 01:32:14.750
"Boat"…

1325
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.458
This one here? Yes. sure…

1326
01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:22.250
It was just my way of saying
I'm coming with you.

1327
01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:25.666
With me?

1328
01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:27.083
Okay.

1329
01:32:27.916 --> 01:32:30.875
I called Strasbourg.
They said there was a problem.

1330
01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:33.666
Your mom said you were heading back.
I thought you'd be here.

1331
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:34.791
Can you hurry?

1332
01:32:34.875 --> 01:32:37.458
-I see… I couldn't understa--
-Can you hurry up?

1333
01:32:38.416 --> 01:32:41.000
-Sorry. but--
-No. Clearly. I'm not getting married.

1334
01:32:41.083 --> 01:32:45.041
Otherwise. I wouldn't be here.
But please. don't make me regret it.

1335
01:33:11.958 --> 01:33:13.916
It's strange seeing it so empty.

1336
01:33:17.041 --> 01:33:20.041
And yet they hate it. even if it's empty.

1337
01:33:22.916 --> 01:33:24.625
What do you think they'll do?

1338
01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:28.500
I don't know. Giorgio.

1339
01:33:29.208 --> 01:33:32.458
Something to prove their point.
a symbolic act. you know.

1340
01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.333
Thanks for being here with me.

1341
01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:49.041
You know. now it doesn't…

1342
01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:51.250
look like a…

1343
01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:53.833
like a disco.

1344
01:33:55.625 --> 01:33:58.000
Finally. you admit it!

1345
01:33:58.083 --> 01:33:59.875
It took a long time!

1346
01:33:59.958 --> 01:34:02.125
Is it true what they say?

1347
01:34:04.416 --> 01:34:05.458
What do they say?

1348
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.958
That you did all this for me.

1349
01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:13.291
That I did all this for you?

1350
01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:19.041
If we really want to go back
to the genesis of the idea.

1351
01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:25.041
it's a type of concept.
a search for absolute freedom.

1352
01:34:25.125 --> 01:34:25.958
So it's always--

1353
01:35:27.666 --> 01:35:30.166
So much for a symbolic act.

1354
01:35:51.166 --> 01:35:53.875
An honor to have you. Admiral.
The ships are in position.

1355
01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:55.083
Civilians on the island?

1356
01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.708
Two. Giorgio Rosa
and an unidentified girl.

1357
01:35:57.791 --> 01:36:00.333
Perfect. We'll wait for Rome
to green-light the attack.

1358
01:36:00.416 --> 01:36:04.250
Let's get moving. Load the cannons.
I want to be home for dinner.

1359
01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:07.250
Here's the bar.
As you can see. it's already equipped.

1360
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:09.541
This year the licenses are on hold.

1361
01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:12.458
but you could turn it
into a restaurant in the future.

1362
01:36:12.541 --> 01:36:16.208
Now. if you can sign here.
so I can get back to City Hall.

1363
01:36:16.291 --> 01:36:17.458
It's so busy today.

1364
01:36:19.125 --> 01:36:23.250
You'll have to tell me
how you got the permit so quickly.

1365
01:36:23.333 --> 01:36:24.916
It's been on hold for years.

1366
01:36:27.541 --> 01:36:28.875
What's going on today?

1367
01:36:29.541 --> 01:36:32.750
They say they're blowing up Rose Island.

1368
01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:36.541
If you could please sign now.
I need to leave.

1369
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:04.000
Good morning. everyone. here we are.

1370
01:37:04.083 --> 01:37:06.250
The showdown
between the Italian government

1371
01:37:06.333 --> 01:37:08.000
and what is known as Rose Island…

1372
01:37:08.083 --> 01:37:11.041
It seems we're back
to the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

1373
01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:12.666
Will Italy have its own Bay of Pigs?

1374
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:15.041
We're in front of Rose Island…

1375
01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:28.125
Come in.

1376
01:37:32.791 --> 01:37:34.458
"Seaside government."

1377
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.541
We worked 20 hours a day.
including Sundays.

1378
01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:41.291
and here. it looks like
we were lying on a beach sunbathing

1379
01:37:41.375 --> 01:37:43.333
and eating spaghetti with clams.

1380
01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:45.041
What can I say. Giovanni?

1381
01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:47.958
We always complain
this is a country with a short memory.

1382
01:37:48.041 --> 01:37:49.916
At least this time it's in our favor.

1383
01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:53.625
Look. I just need a quick signature.

1384
01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:01.041
Is this a joke?

1385
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:06.500
Sorry. but I'm the one
who invented the end-of-term prank.

1386
01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:09.625
I'll even tell you when.
Four years ago. when Aldo resigned.

1387
01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:14.291
We brought him a declaration of war
on Albania. You should've seen his face.

1388
01:38:15.125 --> 01:38:18.083
We had a blast.
Giulio cried with laughter.

1389
01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:20.041
Who are we bombing this time?

1390
01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:22.375
Rose Island. Giovanni.
It must be destroyed.

1391
01:38:22.458 --> 01:38:25.625
And how are you planning to do that?
With surface-to-air missiles?

1392
01:38:25.708 --> 01:38:27.625
I gave orders to arm the Andrea Doria.

1393
01:38:28.166 --> 01:38:30.541
I just need your signature for the attack.

1394
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:40.041
You deployed a battleship from Venice?

1395
01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:42.666
Are you crazy?

1396
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:46.083
Giovanni. you told me to fix the issue
by any means necessary.

1397
01:38:46.166 --> 01:38:50.583
I asked you to solve a problem.
not to bomb the island.

1398
01:38:51.166 --> 01:38:52.458
And to be honest.

1399
01:38:52.541 --> 01:38:55.458
do you know what the best thing
about an outgoing government is?

1400
01:38:55.541 --> 01:38:57.333
That it's no longer our problem.

1401
01:38:57.416 --> 01:38:59.791
After all. it's just an island.
a summer place.

1402
01:38:59.875 --> 01:39:02.875
If they open again in June.
it'll be the next government's problem.

1403
01:39:02.958 --> 01:39:04.083
Who cares?

1404
01:39:04.166 --> 01:39:07.000
Giorgio Rosa appealed
to the European Council.

1405
01:39:07.083 --> 01:39:09.250
And they agreed to look into his case.

1406
01:39:09.875 --> 01:39:11.291
Do you know what that means?

1407
01:39:11.833 --> 01:39:15.291
If they accept his appeal.
the island will be a fully-fledged state.

1408
01:39:15.375 --> 01:39:17.041
just steps away from the communists.

1409
01:39:18.916 --> 01:39:20.791
And am I supposed to sign an act of war?

1410
01:39:21.666 --> 01:39:25.500
Giovanni. we are the only ones left
who can do something about this.

1411
01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.666
Trust me.

1412
01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:41.875
Warships are surrounding the island.

1413
01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:44.625
Nothing gets past you.

1414
01:39:46.875 --> 01:39:48.208
We have to do something.

1415
01:39:49.375 --> 01:39:50.750
Besides drinking. you mean?

1416
01:39:50.833 --> 01:39:52.250
We have to go and defend it.

1417
01:39:53.875 --> 01:39:57.250
Sorry to disappoint you.
but they won't let the Laura Madre pass.

1418
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.250
Not the Laura Madre. no.

1419
01:40:00.125 --> 01:40:01.208
but all the others…

1420
01:40:01.875 --> 01:40:02.916
maybe.

1421
01:40:45.083 --> 01:40:48.166
Operations. something's fast approaching.
36 degrees east.

1422
01:40:48.666 --> 01:40:50.250
What do you mean "something"?

1423
01:40:50.333 --> 01:40:52.916
I don't know.
lots of small things. like a little fleet.

1424
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.666
Water-skiing.
It's a water-skiing competition.

1425
01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:00.041
-During a military operation?
-Authorized by the port authority.

1426
01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.833
I don't bloody care!
Stop them immediately!

1427
01:41:02.916 --> 01:41:04.833
They all paid the entry fee months ago.

1428
01:41:04.916 --> 01:41:07.458
The port authority won't accept liability
or refund them.

1429
01:41:12.375 --> 01:41:13.208
Fine.

1430
01:41:14.541 --> 01:41:15.375
Fine.

1431
01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:18.291
Tell them we're turning now!

1432
01:41:18.375 --> 01:41:20.375
Neumann. we're turning!

1433
01:41:46.583 --> 01:41:48.416
Rome has authorized the attack. sir.

1434
01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.375
Perfect. Call the admiral. come on.

1435
01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:52.791
Sir. we have another problem.

1436
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:58.375
I told you the water-skiing competition
was a good idea.

1437
01:42:00.625 --> 01:42:02.750
I'm sorry. my friend. Really.

1438
01:42:03.958 --> 01:42:06.125
Nice to meet you. I'm Neumann.

1439
01:42:06.708 --> 01:42:08.291
Nice to meet you. Gabriella.

1440
01:42:08.375 --> 01:42:12.416
I'm the organizer of this competition
that helped avoid a military occupation.

1441
01:42:13.416 --> 01:42:16.833
Next time. we'll organize it
for the end of August. It's freezing now!

1442
01:42:16.916 --> 01:42:18.541
If there is a next time.

1443
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:20.583
Neumann's here now!

1444
01:42:20.666 --> 01:42:23.625
Let me talk to them.
I've been through war before.

1445
01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:26.333
Sorry. I need to put some clothes on.

1446
01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:32.041
So.

1447
01:42:32.541 --> 01:42:35.458
our objective today.
is to wipe out that pile of junk--

1448
01:42:35.541 --> 01:42:37.083
Admiral. we have a problem.

1449
01:42:37.166 --> 01:42:39.458
The civilians on the island
have multiplied.

1450
01:42:39.541 --> 01:42:42.708
What do you mean "multiplied"?
They're not bloody bacteria!

1451
01:42:42.791 --> 01:42:46.041
They used the water-ski competition
as a cover to get on the island.

1452
01:42:47.791 --> 01:42:49.250
Mr. Carrisi.

1453
01:42:49.958 --> 01:42:52.500
you're very lucky to be this young.

1454
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.583
You know what they did to people like you
on the hellish routes to Benghazi?

1455
01:42:56.666 --> 01:42:57.708
I'm sorry. sir.

1456
01:42:57.791 --> 01:42:59.833
Aim the cannons.
and fire two warning shots.

1457
01:42:59.916 --> 01:43:01.375
They're just spineless kids.

1458
01:43:01.458 --> 01:43:04.375
They'll run away
as soon as they smell the gunpowder.

1459
01:43:04.458 --> 01:43:05.291
Yes. sir.

1460
01:43:17.625 --> 01:43:18.833
What do we do now?

1461
01:43:20.625 --> 01:43:22.125
What do you say. Rudy?

1462
01:43:22.791 --> 01:43:23.791
God knows.

1463
01:43:24.708 --> 01:43:27.916
"God knows"? You always go on about
how you've been to war.

1464
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.833
I didn't think they'd aim the cannons.

1465
01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:34.166
They're only trying to scare us.

1466
01:43:36.083 --> 01:43:37.166
I'm not buying it.

1467
01:44:33.666 --> 01:44:36.125
Soldiers… they're all the same.

1468
01:44:36.625 --> 01:44:40.125
They act threatening.
but they don't have the balls to shoo--

1469
01:45:12.291 --> 01:45:14.791
Admiral. the civilians are still there.
holding hands.

1470
01:45:15.958 --> 01:45:17.416
They're challenging us. sir.

1471
01:45:19.875 --> 01:45:21.041
Shoot closer.

1472
01:45:23.208 --> 01:45:25.541
Admiral. I'd advise against it.
It's too risky.

1473
01:45:25.625 --> 01:45:27.458
Shoot closer.

1474
01:45:36.958 --> 01:45:40.416
Well. I guess I was wrong.
We should go now. At least we tried.

1475
01:45:41.041 --> 01:45:42.000
I'm not moving.

1476
01:45:42.083 --> 01:45:44.833
Rudy's right. They're firing cannons.

1477
01:45:44.916 --> 01:45:46.333
Staying here is suicide.

1478
01:45:47.416 --> 01:45:48.708
Think of the baby.

1479
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:50.250
What do you mean?

1480
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:52.708
What about
the "first natural-born citizen"?

1481
01:45:52.791 --> 01:45:55.458
You're still going on about that?

1482
01:45:55.541 --> 01:45:57.333
It was bullshit. a joke!

1483
01:45:58.166 --> 01:46:01.125
Giorgio. listen. I know how soldiers--

1484
01:46:01.208 --> 01:46:03.708
It was good knowing you. Rudy.

1485
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.375
Send in the Raiders.

1486
01:50:28.375 --> 01:50:29.375
Listen…

1487
01:50:31.916 --> 01:50:34.000
about your dad's TV that time.

1488
01:50:34.833 --> 01:50:35.666
I'm sorry.

1489
01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:38.625
I never apologized.

1490
01:50:42.333 --> 01:50:43.791
It's okay. Who cares.

1491
01:50:44.708 --> 01:50:46.833
The important thing's to change the world.

1492
01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.208
Or at least try to.

1493
01:51:32.625 --> 01:51:36.875
The Council of Europe declared
it couldn't deliberate on the dispute

1494
01:51:36.958 --> 01:51:40.083
between the Italian State
and the free Republic of Rose Island

1495
01:51:40.166 --> 01:51:42.833
as the island
was outside European territorial waters.

1496
01:51:42.916 --> 01:51:45.541
essentially acknowledging it
as an independent state.

1497
01:51:46.333 --> 01:51:49.666
To prevent similar events
from happening again.

1498
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:52.208
the UN moved the borders
of international waters

1499
01:51:52.291 --> 01:51:54.750
from 6 to 12 nautical miles.
all around the world.

1500
01:51:55.833 --> 01:51:59.208
To this day.
the destruction of Rose Island

1501
01:51:59.291 --> 01:52:02.500
is the one and only invasion
perpetrated by the Italian Republic.

1502
01:52:03.875 --> 01:52:08.166
Giorgio and Gabriella
spent the rest of their lives together.
