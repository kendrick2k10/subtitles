3
00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:29.008
Damn it's cold today. Put more
wood on the fire.

4
00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:32.756
Watch him!

5
00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:17.296
Is that it?

6
00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:23.469
I risk coming all the way out
here. for this?

7
00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:25.887
It cost my father his life.

8
00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:28.015
It’s everything.

9
00:12:57.298 --> 00:13:00.134
Sturmbannführer Lehmann. How
can I help you?

10
00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:03.220
Why is there no new progress on
the latest round of tests?

11
00:13:03.762 --> 00:13:06.723
I am working twenty hours a day
on the project.

12
00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:14.815
May I remind you that seeing your wife and daughter
every month is a privilege...

13
00:13:16.108 --> 00:13:18.527
That can change at any time.

14
00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:22.698
I have new results to discuss
with the team.

15
00:13:26.327 --> 00:13:29.205
I would also like to remind you
of what will happen...

16
00:13:29.246 --> 00:13:32.833
...should you decide to withhold
results of this vital research.

17
00:13:44.053 --> 00:13:49.433
That would be considered
sabotage against the Reich.

18
00:18:16.575 --> 00:18:18.827
Time to leave.

19
00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:33.504
Churchill’s not invading
tonight. look at it out there.

20
00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:37.591
Sure. you go back. Skip the
patrol. warm your feet.

21
00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:42.013
Then get court-martialed. Fine
by me.

22
00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:42.216
I won't let it go.

23
00:22:42.841 --> 00:22:45.261
Hold it. hold it. hold it

24
00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:47.513
No. no.

25
00:22:47.554 --> 00:22:48.639
I won!

26
00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:50.682
Stop.

27
00:22:53.144 --> 00:22:56.647
We are just having a little bit
of fun. It won’t do any harm.

28
00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:58.357
Hmm? One more time?

29
00:22:58.399 --> 00:22:59.650
Yes.

30
00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:00.692
Alexander.

31
00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:04.113
Look at us.

32
00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:07.699
Look what they are doing to us.

33
00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.369
Kalina...

34
00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:18.877
Come on.

35
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:19.920
Smile. sunshine.

36
00:23:37.354 --> 00:23:38.397
Kalina.

37
00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:49.116
It'll be okay.

38
00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:54.788
Seven hours and forty-seven
minutes before we leave. Doctor.

39
00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:59.126
Listen to me. listen carefully.

40
00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:04.840
This is the only way for us to
survive. Do you understand?

41
00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:07.051
We don’t have any choice.

42
00:24:08.302 --> 00:24:09.761
When my work is finished...

43
00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:15.642
Then what will happen to us? When
they don’t need you anymore?

44
00:24:18.562 --> 00:24:22.274
Mama. can I play a new song for
Papa?

45
00:24:22.316 --> 00:24:24.568
That would be wonderful.

46
00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:28.447
Please play.

47
00:24:42.253 --> 00:24:45.631
He has a few hours with his wife
in a whole month.

48
00:24:45.672 --> 00:24:48.717
and he wastes his time listening
to the piano.

49
00:26:18.182 --> 00:26:19.225
Watch him!

50
00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:03.157
Irena. come here.

51
00:31:35.916 --> 00:31:39.211
Please. Come on. everything is
going to be alright.

52
00:31:41.172 --> 00:31:42.381
Hush. hush.

53
00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:03.069
Listen. we have to go.

54
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.029
Come on. Here. hold on to me.

55
00:32:06.738 --> 00:32:08.949
Hold on to me and let’s go.

56
00:33:56.307 --> 00:33:57.808
We're late.

57
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.436
There's no one here.

58
00:34:00.977 --> 00:34:05.107
There’s a dead woman inside. It
could be the scientist's wife.

59
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:07.026
So who did this?

60
00:34:07.568 --> 00:34:10.154
British shell cases. But this is
an American Army issue boot print.

61
00:34:10.196 --> 00:34:13.657
Either way. they got what they
came for. That’s for sure.

62
00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:17.078
They're a group of six or seven.
Going north.

63
00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.456
Judging by the footprints. two are
civilians. one is a young girl.

64
00:34:21.582 --> 00:34:23.709
Now all we have to do is find
them.

65
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.712
They wont get far. We should get
moving.

66
00:34:27.296 --> 00:34:28.797
We'll catch them up.

67
00:34:35.762 --> 00:34:39.350
Let's change clothes. it's time
to switch sides.

68
00:35:43.997 --> 00:35:45.624
Sit over there.

69
00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:12.984
We left her there.

70
00:36:13.027 --> 00:36:15.737
In that house. On her own.

71
00:36:15.779 --> 00:36:17.031
Listen.

72
00:36:17.698 --> 00:36:18.740
Listen to me.

73
00:36:20.201 --> 00:36:23.079
Mama is far away.

74
00:36:24.288 --> 00:36:26.457
In a peaceful place.

75
00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:28.084
Do you hear me?

76
00:36:29.126 --> 00:36:30.086
There. there.

77
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.256
We have to believe these
soldiers will save us.

78
00:36:34.298 --> 00:36:36.383
That they can get us to a safe
place.

79
00:37:07.581 --> 00:37:09.750
...to a safe place.

80
00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:11.293
Mama would want that.

81
00:39:00.819 --> 00:39:01.945
Two beers.

82
00:39:02.696 --> 00:39:03.655
Yes. yes.

83
00:39:09.786 --> 00:39:13.207
My friend! So good to see you
back.

84
00:39:13.249 --> 00:39:15.167
Hey! Good to see you.

85
00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:17.461
Come. let’s have a real drink.

86
00:39:17.503 --> 00:39:22.008
Is that beer? Vodka for my
friends here!

87
00:39:22.049 --> 00:39:26.928
You know I keep the best stuff in the
back. Go get a bottle. I’ll join you soon.

88
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:27.929
Yes.

89
00:39:28.305 --> 00:39:30.807
Let’s go out there. Come on.
guys!

90
00:39:31.183 --> 00:39:33.185
Let’s go.

91
00:39:41.443 --> 00:39:43.112
Are you crazy coming here?

92
00:39:43.529 --> 00:39:47.991
The whole village could be shot because
you’re walking around like fools.

93
00:39:50.827 --> 00:39:53.289
Your boat was found.

94
00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:46.800
They planned to meet people
here.

95
00:40:48.594 --> 00:40:49.803
A broken piece of radio.

96
00:40:50.387 --> 00:40:53.390
This camp was abandoned. so there
was no one here to meet them.

97
00:40:53.682 --> 00:40:56.477
According to the tracks. one of
them is bleeding.

98
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.690
Egorov went into the forest and
saw patrols.

99
00:41:02.149 --> 00:41:03.775
They’re searching for them.

100
00:41:04.276 --> 00:41:08.405
There’s a village a couple of
kilometers south east. in the valley.

101
00:41:10.157 --> 00:41:12.409
This meeting didn't happen.

102
00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:17.623
They must have gone to find them in the
village. Their footprints lead that way.

103
00:41:17.664 --> 00:41:19.625
They’ve either got balls. or
they’re crazy.

104
00:41:19.666 --> 00:41:20.417
Either way.

105
00:41:22.169 --> 00:41:24.671
They have a valuable asset. and
wounded in the group.

106
00:41:24.713 --> 00:41:26.048
Their radio isn't working.

107
00:41:27.133 --> 00:41:30.844
If they can’t find these locals.
maybe they won't have a way out.

108
00:42:05.462 --> 00:42:08.840
Sturmbannführer. are you joining
the search too?

109
00:42:09.133 --> 00:42:11.343
No. we're on other business.

110
00:42:12.386 --> 00:42:14.971
Very well sir. We're needed on the
other side of this forest here.

111
00:42:15.014 --> 00:42:16.182
By the river...

112
00:42:18.392 --> 00:42:19.810
What's wrong with him?

113
00:42:24.731 --> 00:42:25.941
He's bulletproof.

114
00:45:10.314 --> 00:45:11.940
Stay there! Don’t move!

115
00:45:37.883 --> 00:45:39.343
Papa! Help!

116
00:45:39.385 --> 00:45:41.178
Don’t move!

117
00:47:01.842 --> 00:47:02.718
Thank you.

118
00:47:03.177 --> 00:47:04.386
You're welcome.

119
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.349
We will do what we can.

120
00:49:56.767 --> 00:50:01.855
But if it comes to it...

121
00:50:02.398 --> 00:50:04.108
You must kill him.

122
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.361
He cannot get into German hands
again.

123
00:52:48.772 --> 00:52:50.982
My name is Sara. And you?

124
00:52:51.275 --> 00:52:52.193
Irena.

125
00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.322
If you like. I’ll teach you how
to shoot.

126
00:52:56.363 --> 00:52:58.574
I could shoot when I was
fifteen.

127
00:52:58.949 --> 00:53:02.244
This might save your life. or
your father's.

128
00:53:04.288 --> 00:53:05.331
Look.

129
00:53:08.209 --> 00:53:09.876
Unlock safety catch.

130
00:53:12.213 --> 00:53:13.630
Aim.

131
00:53:14.506 --> 00:53:16.008
Pull the trigger.

132
00:53:17.593 --> 00:53:18.635
You try.

133
00:53:28.145 --> 00:53:29.313
Irena. what are you doing?

134
00:53:29.355 --> 00:53:31.607
What are you doing? Leave it.
let it go.

135
00:53:31.648 --> 00:53:32.983
Give it here.

136
00:53:35.902 --> 00:53:38.072
You shouldn’t teach a child to
shoot.

137
00:53:50.167 --> 00:53:52.794
A German patrol is rounding up
half the village.

138
00:53:53.379 --> 00:53:54.463
Listen.

139
00:53:55.172 --> 00:53:56.298
We leave now.

140
00:53:56.965 --> 00:53:59.093
There are Germans in the village.

141
00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:00.511
Let’s give them a run for their money.

142
00:54:00.552 --> 00:54:01.553
Sons of bitches.

143
00:57:03.277 --> 00:57:04.528
Round them up!

144
00:57:05.404 --> 00:57:07.448
Him! Do not shoot him!

145
00:59:49.526 --> 00:59:51.445
We'll take the road around to
the east.

146
00:59:52.154 --> 00:59:53.489
And catch them up.

147
00:59:53.864 --> 00:59:57.243
They’re exhausted. wounded. It
should be easy.

148
01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:01.102
I tried to do everything for the best.
To protect you and your mother.

149
01:08:03.604 --> 01:08:05.189
Mama knew it.

150
01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:08.484
Mama understood it.

151
01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:11.820
She really did.

152
01:08:17.201 --> 01:08:19.953
In my work...

153
01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:24.875
When something goes wrong. I can
repeat the experiment.

154
01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.379
Start over. Try again.

155
01:08:29.545 --> 01:08:33.717
Work at it. and work at it. until...

156
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:39.223
I can...

157
01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:43.352
...get it right.

158
01:08:43.394 --> 01:08:46.605
But now...

159
01:08:46.647 --> 01:08:49.190
I am powerless. I can’t start over.

160
01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:59.825
I can’t turn back time...

161
01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:07.418
I promise I’ll keep you safe
too. Papa.

162
01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:14.295
Halt!

163
01:11:16.213 --> 01:11:17.256
Where is he?

164
01:11:17.298 --> 01:11:19.341
I don’t understand.

165
01:11:21.218 --> 01:11:24.346
Is he in the house? How many are
in there?

166
01:11:42.906 --> 01:11:44.241
Hide in here.

167
01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:31.348
What are you doing?

168
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:32.349
<i>Get up.</i>

169
01:13:32.391 --> 01:13:33.350
What are you doing?

170
01:13:33.392 --> 01:13:34.393
<i>Get up.</i>

171
01:13:36.062 --> 01:13:37.354
<i>Let's go.</i>

172
01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:47.114
Who's this crazy bitch?

173
01:14:27.321 --> 01:14:29.573
Give me the gun.

174
01:15:08.654 --> 01:15:10.822
We need some transport.

175
01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:52.448
Follow them!

176
01:17:45.144 --> 01:17:47.646
Maybe we can still take them.

177
01:17:47.688 --> 01:17:50.274
No. We won’t get him.

178
01:17:56.447 --> 01:18:01.077
But the Nazis won’t get him
either.

179
01:18:01.118 --> 01:18:03.287
Maybe that’s enough.

180
01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:38.864
Hey. what's going on?

181
01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.034
<i>You should go. I'll hold them
off.</i>

182
01:20:05.076 --> 01:20:06.868
No Bonderenko. I make the
decisions around here.

183
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:08.037
<i>I wont make it.</i>

184
01:20:13.084 --> 01:20:17.088
<i>Go. or do you all want to die
for that stupid American?</i>

185
01:20:31.852 --> 01:20:35.397
<i>OK. I wont tell anyone you died
for the capitalists.</i>

186
01:20:35.647 --> 01:20:38.400
<i>I always liked your sense of
humour.</i>

187
01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.403
Let's go.

188
01:21:07.804 --> 01:21:10.307
You forgot. bitches. that I'm
bulletproof.

189
01:26:37.218 --> 01:26:38.510
Mine.

190
01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:41.722
Alright then. one more time.

191
01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:42.514
Watch.

192
01:26:42.556 --> 01:26:44.516
Abracadabra. hocus pocus...

193
01:26:47.061 --> 01:26:47.936
I won.

194
01:26:48.479 --> 01:26:49.646
Well. I never do.

195
01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.069
You won. you won. my darling.

196
01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.915
I have to get back to work.

197
01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.542
Alright. Papa.

198
01:27:20.844 --> 01:27:24.348
Ah. I’ve forgotten something.
