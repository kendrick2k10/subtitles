00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.600
Yeah.

186
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.970
Yeah. you paid in full.

187
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.890
Man. I tried to contact
you a bunch after.

188
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.560
but I must have
had the wrong info.

189
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.050
Yeah. I can't remember
what happened exactly.

190
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.630
So I'm John. if
you don't remember.

191
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.170
And that's Nick over there.
but let him approach you.

192
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.570
He's got a bit of
a pre-game routine.

193
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.230
Got it.

194
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.220
Yeah.

195
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.130
And this rude ginger
here. that's Kevin.

196
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.040
I'd advise not letting
him approach you at all.

197
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.910
Dude. I'm strawberry blonde.

198
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.100
What's up. bro.

199
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.420
I'm Kevin.

200
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.670
Basically the only
funny guy on the team.

201
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.470
Nice to meet you.

202
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.330
Totally.

203
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.250
Oh John. John. John.
is it cool if I

204
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.510
get your back up stick again?

205
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.040
Dude. this is the
third game in a row.

206
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.360
Get a new stick.

207
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.919
I can just go home.

208
00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.659
Yeah. you can.

209
00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.429
All right. man.

210
00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:37.720
Yes.

211
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.000
Hey. no slapshots though.

212
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.010
What about my heater?

213
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.240
What heater?

214
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.240
Oh. you'll see.

215
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.040
Game's at00. right?

216
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.030
Yeah. we're not really like
the warming up kind of team.

217
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.270
Guys tend to trickle in.
like. right before puck drop.

218
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.890
How many guys are you expecting?

219
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.120
Counting you?

220
00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.500
Seven. maybe eight.

221
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.055
Yikes.

222
00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:01.930
I'll try not to weigh
you guys down too much.

223
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.222
Dude. don't even sweat it. man.

224
00:09:03.222 --> 00:09:04.780
We're just glad you're here.

225
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.920
Maybe eight?

226
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.420
Who's the maybe?

227
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.290
Jason.

228
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.490
[LAUGHS]

229
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.140
Dude.

230
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.820
Dude. Jason's not coming. man.

231
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.960
No chance.

232
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.860
No way. man.

233
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.270
He's right.

234
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.580
It'll be seven plus Nick.

235
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.960
Why so many no shows?

236
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.703
Dude. it's just
the late game. man.

237
00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:24.370
It's like pulling
teeth with these guys.

238
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.050
Oh God. here we go.

239
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.480
John. just do it man.
before. anyone else shows up.

240
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.910
I don't know if you have a
dentist in town yet. but like.

241
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.040
I could totally hook you up.

242
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.800
Oh.

243
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.620
Um. thanks.

244
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.340
Yeah.

245
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.420
I'll let you know.

246
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.400
I've got coupon codes
on there. details

247
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.190
about our super
convenient online portal.

248
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.950
And yeah. I wrote my email
and my celly on the back.

249
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.420
Oh yeah.

250
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.500
chicletsmagnet@jcdentistry.com.

251
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.620
Just don't let him bully you
into a free mouthguard fitting.

252
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.260
Spoiler alert. you still
pay for the mouth guard.

253
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.390
I don't get why
you guys talk shit.

254
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.650
Because you need shit.

255
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.170
Most people charge for
the fitting in addition

256
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.910
to the mouthpiece.

257
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.730
The point is. though. I don't
put pressure on my teammates.

258
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.362
If you want a
mouthpiece. I got a guy.

259
00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:11.070
Just let me know.

260
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.760
Thanks.

261
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.430
I just had my cleaning done.
but I'll try you next time.

262
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.350
Cool. yeah. no pressure at all.

263
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.720
Let me guess. Johnny's
pushing more mouth guards?

264
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.780
Boys. that online
portal. super convenient.

265
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.830
That's my boy.

266
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.570
Yes sir.

267
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.700
What's up. guys?

268
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.700
Hey. this here is Riley.

269
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.590
He's going to be
subbing for us tonight.

270
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.280
Grayson.

271
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.190
What's up. man?

272
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.730
Yo dude.

273
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.180
Tyler.

274
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:31.810
How's it going?

275
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.900
Were y'all the guys smoking out
that car in the parking lot?

276
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.213
Dude. I fucking called it.

277
00:10:36.213 --> 00:10:37.630
I told you I wasn't
sketching out.

278
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.350
He was dead ass looking at us.

279
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.850
Oh yeah.

280
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.650
You were so fucking sketched
out. are you kidding me?

281
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.650
Here's your jersey. bud.

282
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.730
Oh. shoot. John.
you even washed it.

283
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.830
Yeah. I hope you like apple pie.

284
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.190
So no Jason tonight?

285
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.340
[LAUGHS]

286
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.170
Dude. no.

287
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.550
Called that shit too.

288
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.230
What's up. fellas?

289
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.120
Hey.

290
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.620
What's up. Sondy.

291
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.880
Just laid the wood on
Smokey Seafood 6-2. dude.

292
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.700
Yeah.

293
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.370
So you score any?

294
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.930
How about a hat trick. huh?

295
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.870
Not so bad.

296
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.610
Yeah.

297
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.300
Good job. bud.

298
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.050
Thank you.

299
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.820
Hat trick and a win.

300
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.480
You going to celebrate?

301
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.580
Well. some Shoney's
would hit the spot.

302
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.470
but unfortunately it's too
late and they're closed.

303
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.358
Oh. yeah man. too bad.

304
00:11:26.358 --> 00:11:28.400
Probably going to have to
hold off till Thursday.

305
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.530
'cause they're opening
that new Super Shoney's up

306
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.670
in Spartanburg.

307
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.010
Dude. I have been
dying to try one.

308
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.480
What makes it super?

309
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.610
How about an ice cream station.

310
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.900
Wait. did I say a?

311
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.040
I mean two ice cream stations
and a meat carving station.

312
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.270
Also Edwin McCain is
cutting the ribbon.

313
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.920
Wow.

314
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.450
Need I say more. fellas?

315
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.400
That does sound--
that sounds super.

316
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.440
Super lame.

317
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.460
Yeah.

318
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.300
Man. well. safe travels. dude.

319
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.770
I know it's a long drive.

320
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.490
It is far. but it
will be worth it.

321
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.840
If you say so.

322
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.960
So anything else you need?

323
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.540
Oh yeah. sorry. I noticed
you guys were short.

324
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.500
So maybe I should just
bring my stuff in here?

325
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.450
Oh no.

326
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:15.230
No. no. no.

327
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.850
I think we're all good. dude.

328
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.400
I just. the guys are on the way.

329
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.547
I mean. it's eight minutes
till ice time. dude.

330
00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:24.880
Maybe I could join the pie boys.

331
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.900
I'll just chill.

332
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.150
We appreciate it. man. but
I just texted the guys.

333
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.720
They're in the lot.

334
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.887
They're coming in right now.

335
00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:30.580
So.

336
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.997
All right. bros.
have a good game.

337
00:12:31.997 --> 00:12:32.620
Bring it in.

338
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.790
Polly Pies on one?

339
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.420
No?

340
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.440
Nothing?

341
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.520
All right.

342
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.280
Hey. remember. you're
my best friends.

343
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.480
I love you guys.

344
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.100
OK.

345
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.630
What the fuck?

346
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.270
Dude sucks.

347
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.170
This fucking guy.

348
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.130
Don't we need the help?

349
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.380
Or does he just suck really bad?

350
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.790
Where to start. man?

351
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.210
He's not. like. bad at hockey.

352
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.730
Dude. he is annoying as fuck.

353
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.660
More annoying than me.

354
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.120
By a little.

355
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.350
And he doesn't fucking
pass. like. ever.

356
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.900
And he talks about Shoney's
all the fucking time.

357
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.130
What is Shoney's?

358
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.800
Oh man. dude.

359
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.920
He would fucking kill
for you to ask him that.

360
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.410
It's basically like a
mediocre buffet place.

361
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.880
It's popular with the
after church crowd.

362
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.640
He's OK with this
being a different food

363
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.160
establishment then?

364
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.100
[LAUGHS]

365
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.270
That's good. man.

366
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.470
Hey. maybe we can use that as
an excuse for the next time.

367
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.087
Not even funny.

368
00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:31.170
So what's with this place?

369
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.270
Are we sponsored or something?

370
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.610
Proton here thought we might
get some free pie out of it.

371
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.580
Dude. it still might work.

372
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.570
Polly just said we got
to win the championship.

373
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.790
I mean. it's so doable.

374
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.780
Definitely possible.

375
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.670
All right. well we could
have bought 50 pies

376
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.290
for the cost of these jerseys.

377
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.520
Yeah. but as everyone
knows. dude. free pie just

378
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.780
tastes better.

379
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.830
Right?

380
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.350
Don't you think jerseys were
just committing a little too

381
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.370
much to this bit?

382
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.380
No. I don't.

383
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.030
Dude. Johnny's
just mad we didn't

384
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.470
let him sponsor the team.

385
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.600
Marketing is tough these days.

386
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.420
If you guys had businesses.
I'd happily support them.

387
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.200
But dude. John Calamino's
Cavity Crunchers?

388
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.670
It's alliteration.

389
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.220
You guys were cool
with Polly's Pies.

390
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.400
Yeah. but we gave you
the shoulder patch.

391
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.030
That's true.

392
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.750
OK.

393
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.680
Really?

394
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.410
Yeah. no one can
fucking read it.

395
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.190
I know that was on purpose.

396
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.410
What?

397
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.570
Dude. come on.

398
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.710
Johnny. why the fuck?

399
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.060
Look at me. John.

400
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.240
Do you think I would do
something like that on purpose?

401
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.020
Seriously though.

402
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.190
Hey man.

403
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:48.634
I know you're new and all. but
I'm the funny guy on the team.

404
00:14:48.634 --> 00:14:50.480
Huh?

405
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.680
That joke you said in there?

406
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.310
That's something I do.

407
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.500
But dude. don't think
about it too hard.

408
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.980
I've known these
guys for a while.

409
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.522
You'll totally get it.

410
00:14:59.522 --> 00:15:01.680
You dripped some water on
your shirt. by the way.

411
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.430
Boop.

412
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.570
[LAUGHS] Gotcha. man.

413
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.090
See you out there. bud.

414
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.715
Stupid new guy.

415
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.410
You looking forward
to getting on the ice?

416
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.100
No.

417
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.457
Not at all.

418
00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:16.040
Dude. we got to have
a better attitude

419
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.120
in front of the new guy.

420
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.580
We could just
forfeit and go home.

421
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.480
That does sound nice.
but we're already here.

422
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.240
Yeah. that's true.

423
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.500
Hey. Noely's here.

424
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.250
What's up. baby?

425
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.060
Thank God.

426
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.950
Hurry up. please.

427
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.770
Hey.

428
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:28.730
Hey. go warm up.

429
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:29.772
I'll see you in a second.

430
00:15:29.772 --> 00:15:33.638
All right. playboys. stay
hawrt Oh. what's up. boys?

431
00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:35.180
Good thing I'm still
in my gear. huh?

432
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.722
Because according
to my calculations.

433
00:15:36.722 --> 00:15:37.648
you're down a skater.

434
00:15:37.648 --> 00:15:38.690
So you want me to hop on?

435
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.410
I'm still loose.

436
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.480
Yeah. yeah. no. no.

437
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.770
Noel just showed up.

438
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.290
That's cool.

439
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.790
Noel's cool.

440
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.330
I love Noel.

441
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:44.913
You love Noel.

442
00:15:44.913 --> 00:15:45.980
We all love Noel and me.

443
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.780
But earlier Kevin
came up to me and he

444
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.250
was like. "oh my
God. Sondy. you're

445
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.380
the best hockey-- you're like
Connor McSondy or whatever.

446
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:51.860
you know what I mean?

447
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.038
So could you hop on the ice?

448
00:15:53.038 --> 00:15:54.080
Because we need the dub."

449
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.205
And I was like. "I guess
I could do that. you know.

450
00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.410
because I'd love to."

451
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.280
Dude. as much as I would
like to not play with Kevin.

452
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.340
it's not my call.

453
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:02.840
I hear you.

454
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.910
I don't have a
letter on my jersey.

455
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.800
You're going to have
to talk to the captain.

456
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.170
Johnny boy here's
got you covered. OK?

457
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.640
I hear you loud and clear.

458
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.260
Yeah. so talk to John.

459
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.290
John. you got it.

460
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.730
Hattie then some natties.

461
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.440
Hey. maybe.

462
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.520
Stay cold.

463
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.275
All right. will do.

464
00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:22.400
What do you think. captain?

465
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.280
You need three goals
in your corner?

466
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.970
As nice as that sounds.
Sondy. um. jersey.

467
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.410
you'd have to wear
a white jersey

468
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.540
or they'd make us forfeit.

469
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.110
I know what you're saying.

470
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.140
You're saying that I
need a white jersey

471
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.550
because you need me.

472
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.020
So you know what?

473
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.430
I will not fail you.

474
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.030
I'm on my way to
get a white jersey.

475
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.720
I'm going to save the game.

476
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.680
Fuck.

477
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.197
Goddamn bunch of jerks.

478
00:16:52.197 --> 00:16:54.030
Keeping me here till
after friggin' midnight

479
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.490
to play goddamn
beer league hockey.

480
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.870
Ooh. I scored a goal
in front of six guys.

481
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.490
Fucking meat head pigeons.

482
00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.260
Fuck you looking at?

483
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.160
Nothing.

484
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.390
Yeah. thought so.

485
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.740
Keep roaming. keep moving.

486
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.240
Dickhead.

487
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.760
Dude. ignore that guy. man.

488
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.765
How are you feeling?

489
00:17:23.765 --> 00:17:25.640
Well. my gear is crusty
as hell and my skates

490
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.560
are dull. but other
than that. not too bad.

491
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.190
Hey. that's not so bad.

492
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.760
You just get a little sweating
in you. that'll crust out.

493
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.395
Right.

494
00:17:32.395 --> 00:17:34.520
I just hope the muscle
memory comes back. you know?

495
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.600
Yeah.

496
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.140
I hear it's like riding a bike.

497
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.722
But I never learned how
to ride a bike either.

498
00:17:40.722 --> 00:17:41.960
[LAUGHTER]

499
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.820
Oh no.

500
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.290
I didn't know you were
scorekeeping tonight.

501
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.348
Yeah. man.

502
00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:48.140
You want some help?

503
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.770
Yes. please.

504
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.270
I messed up.

505
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.000
All right.

506
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.650
Yeah. thanks.

507
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.340
You're welcome.

508
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.090
How have you been?

509
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.174
I'm good.

510
00:17:54.174 --> 00:17:54.674
You know.

511
00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:55.940
Good.

512
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.328
A nice00 PM
beer league game.

513
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.620
Where else would you rather be?

514
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.880
Oh my God. nowhere.

515
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.970
I know.

516
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.470
Yeah.

517
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.610
Who's the new guy?

518
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.990
Oh. this sweetheart right here?

519
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.980
Oh. this is Riley.

520
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.832
Hey Riley.

521
00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:10.290
Oh my God. Young
Genos are tonight.

522
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.080
Did you guys warn him?

523
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.890
No.

524
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.240
I had to get him in
the building first.

525
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.740
OK.

526
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.700
Nice tactic.

527
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.120
Don't worry about it.

528
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.620
All right.

529
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.000
Just please don't let
them run the score up. OK?

530
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.290
I will do my best.

531
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:22.920
Yeah. OK.

532
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.882
Look at this. huh?

533
00:18:23.882 --> 00:18:24.840
Sweetheart. am I right?

534
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.070
Yeah. chivalry. man.

535
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.960
I know.

536
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.740
Have fun I guess.

537
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.024
We'll try.

538
00:18:30.024 --> 00:18:31.920
[LAUGHS]

539
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.260
So who are we playing tonight?

540
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.300
The Young Genos.

541
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.150
I mean. are they good?

542
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.470
I mean. they're really good.

543
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.553
They're the whole reason
we have a mercy rule now.

544
00:18:42.553 --> 00:18:44.430
They beat this team 24 to 1.

545
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.120
Holy shit.

546
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.980
Beat their dicks in the dirt.

547
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.270
But don't feel too bad.

548
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.660
