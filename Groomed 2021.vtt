00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.624
[Gwen]<i> The dream</i>
<i>starts like this.</i>

4
00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:31.530
<i>I see myself getting
out of the water</i>

5
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.908
<i>and I see somebody.
I can't see it very clearly.</i>

6
00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.778
<i>but I see a person
from the back.</i>

7
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.849
<i>I follow him.</i>

8
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.292
<i>And then I see a lot of people</i>

9
00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.860
<i>standing
in the communal showers.</i>

10
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.862
<i>Nobody is looking at me.</i>

11
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:16.041
<i>There's a little hallway
with four bathroom stalls.</i>

12
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:19.578
<i>After those four
regular bathroom doors.</i>

13
00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.779
<i>there's a big door.</i>

14
00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.256
<i>From the moment
I opened the door.</i>

15
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.425
<i>it's like things
moved really quickly.</i>

16
00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.861
[water running]

17
00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.270
<i>At that moment.
I see just a lot of blood.</i>

18
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.941
<i>It's everywhere and I panicked.</i>

19
00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.820
How can something
that wasn't scary at the time

20
00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:02.988
be so scary later?

21
00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.125
Like. how can I wake up
at night now being terrified.

22
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.659
even though back then
it was like.

23
00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.095
"All right. let's go into the
shower. Let's just do this."

24
00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.113
<i>My mom
always called me "Waterrat."</i>

25
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.416
Literally. It'd be a water rat.

26
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.118
That's somebody
who just always wants

27
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.019
to be in the water.

28
00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.423
I always loved swimming.
I was always in the water.

29
00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.232
<i>I grew up in a small town
in Southern Holland.</i>

30
00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.768
<i>in what I would call
a very normal family.</i>

31
00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.237
<i>I had loving parents.
I had an older brother.</i>

32
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.642
<i>One of my favorite memories
growing up</i>

33
00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.777
<i>was getting together for Easter</i>

34
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.045
<i>and it'd be the whole family</i>

35
00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.813
<i>and we would do
this Eastern egg hunt</i>

36
00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.949
<i>and I would always try
to beat my cousins.</i>

37
00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.985
<i>usually not successfully
cause I was the smallest.</i>

38
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.520
<i>I was the youngest one
in the family.</i>

39
00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.994
<i>My childhood was loving.
it was happy.</i>

40
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.062
<i>It was comfortable.</i>

41
00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.175
Yeah.

42
00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.065
<i>The first memory I have.</i>

43
00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.101
<i>we were biking to a swim camp.</i>

44
00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.438
<i>I would bike
and he would bike next to me.</i>

45
00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:35.374
<i>and it was very clear
that his focus</i>

46
00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.908
<i>was entirely on me.</i>

47
00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.778
<i>And that felt really nice.</i>

48
00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.280
[alarm goes off]

49
00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.087
<i>He was an adult
that was swimming on my team.</i>

50
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.890
<i>but would also coach us
when the head couch was out.</i>

51
00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:56.728
<i>"And I just thought. " Wow.
why is this big swimmer.</i>

52
00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.631
<i>this cool guy. that everybody
has respect for...</i>

53
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.400
<i>why does he put so much emphasis</i>

54
00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:02.567
<i>on getting to know me?</i>

55
00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.703
<i>"And why is he asking me
all these questions?"</i>

56
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.073
<i>I just felt
like he really cared.</i>

57
00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.675
<i>and he became my best friend.</i>

58
00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.627
<i>There were moments
where I was afraid of him.</i>

59
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.128
but most of the time I wasn't

60
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.831
and that just feels off.
That feels weird.

61
00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.100
It feels like if somebody
hurts you.

62
00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.835
you should be afraid of them

63
00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.438
and you should be angry
at them afterward.

64
00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:42.808
So. when you don't feel anger
and you don't feel...

65
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.145
like you were afraid of them

66
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.948
then it must not be
something that was wrong.

67
00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.484
It's not logical.

68
00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.944
[starts crying]

69
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.227
<i>My boyfriend. actually. he said.</i>

70
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.162
"I think you need
to not run away from it

71
00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.264
and really try to face it."

72
00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:45.704
Actually. what a lot of people
don't realize is how much traumatic is

73
00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.907
with something
that happens so long ago.

74
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.475
<i>Well. even 18 years later.</i>

75
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.812
almost every week that
something happens that. like.

76
00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:58.116
triggers some. like.
tears or even panics.

77
00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:06.525
[Gwen]<i> I know I need help.</i>
<i>So I started calling experts.</i>

78
00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.561
[phone rings]

79
00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:13.131
Thank you for making the time
to chat. Hey. how are you?

80
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.400
He was both an older teammate

81
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.069
and then he would swap in
for the coach.

82
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:21.706
So he would get me
gifts and cards and letters.

83
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.076
and he would say.
"Gosh. you... I know you're 11.

84
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.247
but you're actually 18
in the way that you behave."

85
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.851
<i>And after hearing my story.
they all said the same thing.</i>

86
00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.786
It's classic grooming.

87
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.988
I started thinking.
"What's this grooming thing?"

88
00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.524
I feel like it's something that
I really need to understand.

89
00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.437
[Oprah]<i> Most kids are molested
by people that they trust.</i>

90
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.373
Either a family member
or a close friend.

91
00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.542
That is how it happens.

92
00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.512
and the grooming
is what makes it possible.

93
00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.446
I liked him

94
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.881
and I would tell him
I liked him.

95
00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.082
and I liked the attention.

96
00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:07.853
He makes the child feel
that the child is a part of it.

97
00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.654
[Gwen]<i> I thought</i>
<i>that because I liked him</i>

98
00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.256
<i>it wasn't really abuse.</i>

99
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.291
<i>But maybe it was.</i>

100
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.862
Confusion is actually
the biggest thing

101
00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.598
that keeps people powerless.

102
00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.973
After learning about grooming.

103
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:32.310
I was. first of all.
really angry.

104
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.946
[Gwen]<i> Why had I never heard</i>
<i>from this before?</i>

105
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.882
<i>Why don't we all know
about this?</i>

106
00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:41.353
So I decided that I wanted
to make a film.

107
00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:45.790
This is what I need to do.
and this is a story

108
00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:48.159
that I can tell
because I went through it.

109
00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.126
[man] Okay. let me know
when you're good.

110
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:22.427
Hey. Barbi.

111
00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:25.463
[man] And it's all yours.

112
00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.266
What happened when you learned
what grooming was?

113
00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.035
[Barbi]
When I learned about grooming.

114
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:33.038
I started really reflecting back

115
00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.406
and remembering.

116
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.242
"wow. like. all these incidents

117
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.378
that I thought
were joyful and fun. he...

118
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.447
he was grooming me.

119
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.784
He was setting me up
for this abuse.

120
00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:49.955
I think he targeted me

121
00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:54.693
because he could spot
my desire to please.

122
00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:57.529
It was hard for me
to express myself

123
00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:00.231
and I never really felt
like I fit in.

124
00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.933
I was really quiet.

125
00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.669
I really kept to myself.

126
00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:07.505
I think I was always quiet
and sort of reserved.

127
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.376
and always had. like. a book
that I would be reading.

128
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.011
My parents fought constantly

129
00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:15.080
about finances
and lack of money.

130
00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:19.150
That constant emotional
upheaval within the house

131
00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:23.121
made me feel very vulnerable.

132
00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:26.391
What I started to realize
is that what happened to me

133
00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:28.793
wasn't the exemption.
it was the rule.

134
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.609
[Andy]<i> I would suggest you</i>
<i>consider proxy clarification</i>

135
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.379
<i>and what happens
is you take the victim.</i>

136
00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:51.583
have an offender match them
who's really in recovery

137
00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:54.319
and have them
just have a conversation.

138
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.795
<i>There's a woman who called
me one day after I did a workshop</i>

139
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.130
and she said.

140
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.966
"Could you hook me up with
one of these proxy clarifications?"

141
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.933
We did it.

142
00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.936
and 'til she died.
I got a card every year

143
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.772
and the essence
of what she said was.

144
00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.573
"I felt responsibility.

145
00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.609
like. almost
a physical sensation of it

146
00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:18.977
lifting from me.

147
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.945
and I finally felt
free at last."

148
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.421
[man] Up and here you go.

149
00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.157
Okay.

150
00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.760
This is file 1.
Mark. cameras A and B.

151
00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.964
Okay. give me
about 30 seconds in here.

152
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.336
[Gwen] Okay. it's good? Awesome.

153
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.305
What are the steps
that you go through

154
00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:23.241
when you would groom a child?

155
00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.677
[Dennis] Well. I was
very confident in my grooming.

156
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:26.978
I was very confident

157
00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:28.847
that I could make a kid like me.

158
00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.360
<i>First of all. you have
to pick the right child.</i>

159
00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:46.030
You know. the one you
feel most comfortable with.

160
00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.666
The one that you heard things
about him in the family.

161
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.301
that's may be having
a hard time.

162
00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:53.071
"Who do I think I could train?"

163
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.372
I was very trusting.

164
00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.040
- Insolated.
- Alone.

165
00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:57.008
Quiet.

166
00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.109
On my own a little bit.

167
00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:04.149
[Gwen]<i> I was</i>
<i>an insecure little girl.</i>

168
00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.718
<i>My body language probably
showed up a little bit.</i>

169
00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:09.788
I was really struggling
with who I was.

170
00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:12.724
why were my friends
not accepting me.

171
00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:15.393
I was really looking
for somebody

172
00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.528
that cared for me.

173
00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.900
[Jim]<i> Can you spot</i>
<i>the sex offender?</i>

174
00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:25.570
Is it Mr. Businessman here
or is it Deathroll tall guy?

175
00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:28.206
The answer is yes. no.
both. maybe. I don't know.

176
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.209
So. how does a sex offender
groom a victim?

177
00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.278
Adolescent female victims
tell us.

178
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.647
"He was my best friend."

179
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:38.750
"I'm going to do things
and buy things for you."

180
00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.385
"I'm going to send you cards.

181
00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:43.655
I'm going to give you
little bracelets

182
00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:45.557
or I'm going to send you
flowers.

183
00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:47.158
I'm going to give you things."

184
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.127
[Gwen]<i> As you were talking.</i>
<i>I was remembering</i>

185
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.329
<i>the letters and the cards
that he would give me.</i>

186
00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:53.865
and it almost felt like
you were telling my story.

187
00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:57.068
Guess I always viewed him
as somebody who just made

188
00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.069
a little misstep

189
00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:00.772
and he just happened
to fall in love with me

190
00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:02.173
at the wrong time.

191
00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:05.476
[Jim] If the offender
has done their job grooming.

192
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.979
it's going to feel like.
"I was special to him."

193
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.815
You know. you are one of many
who are special to him.

194
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.517
- That's the issue.
- Do you think that?

195
00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.953
From what I know about your
case. I can almost assure you

196
00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:16.721
there were other victims
out there.

197
00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.823
Absolutely other victims.

198
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.925
His grooming process
was very smooth.

199
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.660
Very smooth.

200
00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:25.396
You mentioned you have letters.

201
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:29.000
I think that if we look
at those letters.

202
00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.835
that we're going to see
that that process

203
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.537
is very well done.

204
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.874
You don't get to be
that good at it by accident.

205
00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:38.476
[Jim] You get to be that good
at it through practice.

206
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.679
I've always firmly believe
it was just me.

207
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.882
That he would never do this
to someone else.

208
00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:45.516
and I've never really thought

209
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.719
about there being other victims.

210
00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:49.487
[Gwen] And it changes the story.

211
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:52.924
So. I'm considering
potentially going to Holland

212
00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:57.362
to talk to my family
and maybe talk to the police.

213
00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.630
Your family knows nothing?

214
00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.832
[Gwen] When I was starting
to get all these dreams.

215
00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.934
and I remembered
what had happened.

216
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.102
I actually told them.

217
00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.503
[Jim] And how long ago was that?

218
00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:06.905
That's when I was about 17.

219
00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.339
- [Jim] Okay.
- So. long time ago.

220
00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.608
- [Jim] So. where did that happened?
- The "where."

221
00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.210
So we had one conversation
at night.

222
00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.412
and I remember my dad
running out on the street

223
00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:17.181
with a baseball bat and he was
like. "I'm going to kill him."

224
00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:19.717
And. like. so. so. so angry.

225
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.619
And then we never
talked about it again.

226
00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:24.188
The location
while thinking about this

227
00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:26.824
is going to be
a heck of a trigger.

228
00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:32.063
Expect to be affected a lot.

229
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.277
[Gwen]<i> I'm going to Holland.</i>
<i>actually. in two days.</i>

230
00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.346
It makes me very nervous.
cause on the one hand.

231
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.215
I feel a lot of conviction
and I feel a lot of power

232
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.418
and. like. I need to go
do this and I need to.

233
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.521
you know. make sure that
there's no other people and...

234
00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.389
But then there's
other days when I think.

235
00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.792
"But I don't want
to mess up his life.

236
00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:01.926
<i>What if he's married?"</i>

237
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.862
I've got no idea where he is.
I don't know anything

238
00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:06.397
about what has happened to him.

239
00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:15.907
I have not said his name
in 20 years.

240
00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:19.510
I've never been able
to look him up.

241
00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:20.678
I've never... I don't know.

242
00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:23.781
It's like a physical block.

243
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.051
<i>But I need to cause I do want
to know before I go.</i>

244
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.354
<i>I want to have
a little bit of information.</i>

245
00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:33.024
I'm really afraid
to see a picture.

246
00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:35.994
I don't... I really don't want
to see his face.

247
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.466
I really don't know
if I want to.

248
00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.505
[sighs]

249
00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.210
I can't even...
I don't want to see it.

250
00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:53.711
[sighs]

251
00:16:58.617 --> 00:16:59.484
[sighs]

252
00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:11.696
He showed up.

253
00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:31.049
[starts crying harder]

254
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.554
It makes you want to throw up.

255
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:42.226
I don't know. I guess I
started questioning it again

256
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.430
and start thinking.
"was it just me? Was it..."

257
00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:49.200
"Did you not do anything wrong?"

258
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.239
Yeah. I just want to make sure
it doesn't happen again

259
00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.241
to other people.

260
00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:01.312
[Harriet] <i>You have to organize</i>

261
00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:06.084
and accept the disorganization
about what you feel.

262
00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.619
<i>In that case. it's a step.</i>

263
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.088
<i>It's progress.</i>

264
00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:19.263
[Gwen]<i> After 20 years.</i>
<i>the memories of my childhood</i>

265
00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.599
<i>are just messy and blurry
and incomplete.</i>

266
00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.637
<i>I want to have a better
picture of what happened.</i>

267
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.942
<i>Mostly I'm going to go to
Holland to speak with my family</i>

268
00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:33.311
<i>after so many years of silence.</i>

269
00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:34.545
This is the one thing

270
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.415
that feels like it's
still standing in between us.

271
00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.255
I am going to look
for the letters.

272
00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.191
They should all be
in this little cabinet.

273
00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:51.162
<i>But is possible
my parents found them</i>

274
00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.830
<i>at some point
and threw them out.</i>

275
00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:04.709
<i>I want to report publicly
if I can do it.</i>

276
00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.878
It's still something
that I'm not sure of.

277
00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.847
I think it depends
on the conversations

278
00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:10.781
I'm going to have.

279
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.350
It's going to depend
on the letters.

280
00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:14.352
it's going to depend
on how I feel in the moment.

281
00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:49.193
[Asia]<i> He also</i>
<i>groomed my family.</i>

282
00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:52.196
Like. for example. he asked
my dad for piano lessons.

283
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.499
He had a sister
into our dance club.

284
00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:57.568
And I asked my mom
recently. I was like.

285
00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:59.804
"Why did you
let me go with him?"

286
00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:00.905
Like. "He was a man."

287
00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:03.274
Like. "Didn't you think
it was weird that some man

288
00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:05.443
wanted to spend time
with your 5-year-old?"

289
00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:07.778
<i>And she was like.
"No. you wanted to go.</i>"

290
00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:08.913
<i>and you were so happy.</i>

291
00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.615
<i>"You know. I didn't think
anything was going on."</i>

292
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.385
Like. he didn't set off
that vibe.

293
00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:17.321
He didn't set off
on a pedophile vibe.

294
00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:20.791
Always having priests
come to our home

295
00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.961
was like Jesus Christ himself
was in our house.

296
00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:28.399
[Keith] <i>He infiltrated our
family structure in such a way.</i>

297
00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:30.901
I mean. my parents
went to confession to him.

298
00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:32.803
He knew
what all their sins were.

299
00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.602
[Gwen] This is May. '97.

300
00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:07.471
So that's right about
when he first saw me.

301
00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:19.049
This was my group.
I mean. my class.

302
00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:20.518
they were kind of bullying me.

303
00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:22.720
and I was really unhappy
in this period.

304
00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:27.057
They always called me.
like. "Sheep. Dork."

305
00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:30.194
But the last day of school.
we had like a little party

306
00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:33.697
and there was a song popular
at the time

307
00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:36.267
that was called. "Girl.
you are as ugly as the night."

308
00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.935
and they started
playing that song

309
00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:39.336
and then they all...

310
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:41.472
They've thought about it.
clearly.

311
00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.474
Cause they all.
like. went to the back

312
00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:44.708
and kind of. like. moved.

313
00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:46.844
so I would be the only one
in the middle of the room

314
00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:49.146
and then everybody would be
in a circle around me

315
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.315
and started pointing
and singing the song.

316
00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:54.785
And it was so mean.
it's like so...

317
00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:56.654
I don't know.
I'll never forget that moment.

318
00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:21.378
Yeah.

319
00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:25.616
Yeah.

320
00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:46.023
So I'm going to go upstairs

321
00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:49.159
and see if the letters
that he kind of wrote me

322
00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:50.794
like 20 years ago are upstairs.

323
00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:53.063
And I don't know
if they're there.

324
00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.832
and I don't know
what's going to be in them

325
00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:55.866
if they're there and...

326
00:28:57.435 --> 00:29:01.105
I'm actually nervous to see
if there's stuff in there

327
00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.272
that I don't remember

328
00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:04.308
and I think there's
pictures there too.

329
00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.349
So they're in that
bottom drawer. I think.

330
00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:22.126
This one's empty.
That's bad news.

331
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.194
I'm afraid that they
threw them out.

332
00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.100
Oh. my God. it's all empty.

333
00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:47.451
They cleaned it out.
it's all gone.

334
00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:00.597
[sighs]

335
00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.259
Can I take a moment?

336
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.405
[starts crying]

337
00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:57.421
I don't know if I want
to read them now.

338
00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.708
I'm worried
that it's going to confuse me.

339
00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:19.142
It's going to confuse me.

340
00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:26.149
I'm worried that it's going
to say all these nice things

341
00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:27.017
and then...

342
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.324
and I'm going
to question it again.

343
00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.467
[exhales]

344
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.210
This one's really short. But...

345
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.783
[man voice] <i>"Dear Gwen.</i>

346
00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:02.352
<i>I've known you
for two and a half years now.</i>

347
00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:03.854
<i>You know that most of the time</i>

348
00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.923
<i>I've had very special
feelings for you.</i>

349
00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:09.259
<i>That I would do
anything for you.</i>

350
00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:11.194
<i>That you can come to me
with anything.</i>

351
00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:13.730
<i>no matter how big
or small the problem.</i>

352
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.732
<i>I want to solve
everything for you.</i>

353
00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:19.403
<i>Gwenny.
look at your beautiful eyes.</i>

354
00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.571
<i>your sweet. beautiful.
innocent face.</i>

355
00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:25.175
<i>Put your soft arms around me.</i>

356
00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:26.877
<i>Surrender
to what you're feeling.</i>

357
00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:29.346
<i>It wasn't just that little ass</i>

358
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.548
<i>that caused my little spark.</i>

359
00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:35.385
<i>Also that playful wrestling
made my desire grow.</i>

360
00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.455
<i>"The thought of you
makes my whole body tremble."</i>

361
00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.757
It's so gross. It's so gross!

362
00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.861
[man voice]<i> "I just want</i>
<i>to wake up next to you</i>"

363
00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.463
<i>in a single bed
on Sunday morning.</i>

364
00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:48.532
<i>I just want to take off</i>

365
00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.701
<i>"your blue lingerie
with my teeth."</i>

366
00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.672
[Gwen]<i> I remember liking</i>
<i>what was in them.</i>

367
00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:59.209
now I'm disgusted about them.
But I remember thinking.

368
00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.945
"It's so great all these
things that he's talking about."

369
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.515
Like. "You're so beautiful.
you're so..."

370
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.285
"When you do this with your
mouth. you're so bla. bla. bla."

371
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.920
"The way you do this.
you look so cute.

372
00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:11.588
You look so innocent.
You look so..."

373
00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:13.623
It's disgusting.

374
00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:17.027
Back then. I would read them.
and I would think.

375
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:19.563
"Oh. somebody likes me."
You know?

376
00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:26.336
First of all. he would send me
postcards like this.

377
00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:30.107
And he's an idiot. He clearly
didn't know what he was doing.

378
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:34.144
You wouldn't write
all these stuff on paper

379
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.245
with dates on them

380
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.947
if you knew what the hell
you were doing.

381
00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.327
I don't think he knew that he
was doing something wrong.

382
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:41.351
He doesn't. He still doesn't.

383
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.454
And that makes me sad.

384
00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:48.058
It's like. it's just
a sad soul that. like.

385
00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:51.294
fell in love with an 11-year-old

386
00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.764
and now I'm going ruin
his life for it.

387
00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.832
That doesn't feel right.
you know?

388
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:20.690
[Dennis] <i>It starts from
the moment they get there.</i>

389
00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:24.261
When they get to my house.
I'm grooming.

390
00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:26.396
To build a trusted relationship.

391
00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.998
I'm showing her more affection.

392
00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:28.932
I'm holding her.

393
00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:31.234
You know. I want her
to be my best friend.

394
00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:32.169
that's what I want.

395
00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.970
I always loved my uncle.

396
00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:37.507
'til 20 years later
when I had my best memory.

397
00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:39.876
He was special to me.

398
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.711
[Barbi] They would buy me gifts.

399
00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.580
they would take me
to feed the ducks.

400
00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:47.017
My uncle would let me
play on his CB radio.

401
00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:48.351
and he would let me go in there

402
00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:50.687
and I would be this big girl

403
00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.588
sitting in the seat

404
00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.056
with the microphone
in front of me

405
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:57.694
and he even gave me a CB name.
he called me. "Baby face."

406
00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:03.767
Just imagine how it would be
if the one who's grooming you

407
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.735
is of your own family

408
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:10.140
and very much liked
by your father and mother

409
00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.609
or it is even
your father and mother.

410
00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:14.611
How complicated is that?

411
00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:16.480
To me. my dad was my hero.

412
00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.148
so. like. I wanted
to be like him.

413
00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:19.816
I always thought
that he was smart

414
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:23.220
and like. that he made
something of himself.

415
00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:26.556
He kind of seemed
like a father figure to me.

416
00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:29.226
[Nicole] <i>He was around 65.</i>

417
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.161
<i>He would take me privately
into the back</i>

418
00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:32.729
and ask me how I was doing.

419
00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.331
You know. what my opinions were.

420
00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:35.799
how I was doing in school.

421
00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.767
He would make me special meals.

422
00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:38.902
He was affectionate.

423
00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.537
[Dennis]
I would show the affection.

424
00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:42.216
First thing when she got
out of the car.

425
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.340
I'd be there to greet her.

426
00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:47.110
hug her and hold her.
I almost never left her.

427
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.112
She was my girlfriend to me.
you know?

428
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.580
Rather than a little kid.

429
00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.483
When she came in my room.
I'd be on my computer.

430
00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:56.119
"Come on. sit on my lap.
You can play the computer."

431
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:57.320
You know?

432
00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.456
"I don't let anybody else
play it.

433
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.857
but I'll let you play it."

434
00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:05.362
Well. I definitely
was clearly his favorite.

435
00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.330
He bought me some fragrances.

436
00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.299
- He gave me a ring.
- Lotions.

437
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.878
- Flowers.
- Money.

438
00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:12.369
- Jewelry.
- Perfumes.

439
00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:13.503
Ice cream.

440
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.437
Plane tickets.

441
00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:16.339
[Dennis] I was a con artist.

442
00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:19.342
and I was constantly putting
thoughts on their head.

443
00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.645
You know. I guess you
can call it brainwashing.

444
00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.446
I guess it is brainwashing.

445
00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:25.215
That's what it was
all about. you know?

446
00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:28.218
I was getting what I want.
You know. they loved me.

447
00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:30.153
I knew that I had
to make them think

448
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:32.322
I was the greatest grandpa
in the world.

449
00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:36.126
Did you. like. have code words

450
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.994
with your abuser

451
00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:41.464
that meant something special
to you and him?

452
00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.833
[Gwen] There was this thing
which I had forgotten about.

453
00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:45.502
but it came back
through the letters

454
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:50.440
where nine is my lucky number
and he...

455
00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:52.475
kind of made it
his lucky number too

456
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.712
and there is
so many references to that.

457
00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:57.280
so that became like a thing.

458
00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:59.649
And then
when I was googling him.

459
00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:02.252
what I found was that he
started a company...

460
00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.587
Don't tell me it had nine in it.

461
00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:05.021
- [Gwen] With nine in it.
- Oh.

462
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.023
[Gwen] Something
that was meaningful...

463
00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:09.392
- That only you and him would recognize.
- [Gwen] Right.

464
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:12.062
Talk about being groomed.
like...

465
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.665
It's just unbelievable
the depth of it

466
00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:20.370
- and how intricate it all became.
- [Gwen] Yes.

467
00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:25.075
You think it's about you.
it probably isn't.

468
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.277
<i>It's kind of hard to admit.</i>

469
00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.946
especially if you're still

470
00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.715
in a very vulnerable place.
to say.

471
00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.583
"Oh. that guy
who was saying I'm so special.

472
00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:36.620
"yeah. he's a criminal. I'm actually
not that special." That sucks.

473
00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:42.225
<i>The letters. the gifts.
the many bike rides home.</i>

474
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.594
<i>He had become
a huge part of my life.</i>

475
00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:49.366
<i>But the crazy thing is.
after I left the swim team.</i>

476
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.902
<i>I completely forgot
that any of it ever happened.</i>

477
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:55.438
<i>It's fascinating how the
minds can just block out</i>

478
00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:57.107
<i>what's too painful to remember.</i>

479
00:37:57.908 --> 00:37:59.409
<i>but then five years later.</i>

480
00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:01.378
<i>when I had my first boyfriend.</i>

481
00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.913
<i>I started to have nightmares.</i>

482
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.850
<i>Every night I was in the
shower. I didn't recognize.</i>

483
00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:10.153
<i>It was months later
before I realized</i>

484
00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.355
<i>that those dreams
were actually a memory.</i>

485
00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.759
<i>And when it finally all
became clear.</i>

486
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.627
<i>I wrote him a letter.</i>

487
00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:19.629
<i>I said.
"I'm not going to report you.</i>

488
00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.197
<i>but I want you to seek help."</i>

489
00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.803
<i>And. at some point.
I was walking the dog.</i>

490
00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.405
We were walking here

491
00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.940
and suddenly he had this red car

492
00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:34.277
and he just parked it.
Like this.

493
00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.780
In front of me and got out
of the car. and I...

494
00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.448
That's only the second time

495
00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.183
that I was ever
really scared of him

496
00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:43.119
and he just gets out and says.

497
00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:46.456
"I got your letter".
and he said.

498
00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.892
"You know that's a lie.
You know this was real love."

499
00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:50.660
And he turned around.

500
00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:52.262
went back into his car
and drove off.

501
00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:55.131
And that's the last time
I've ever seen him.

502
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:57.434
but I remember in that moment
when he got out of the car

503
00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:58.301
I thought I was dead.

504
00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:04.641
[Harriet]<i> So you can see how</i>
<i>feeling sorry for the person.</i>

505
00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:07.677
and also doubting.
"maybe it was pure love."

506
00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:09.379
Of course you can confuse them.

507
00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:14.384
[Gwen]
So I'm starting to wonder.

508
00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:17.687
"Do I want to report
my offender or do I not?"

509
00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:20.724
And part
of why it's so difficult

510
00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:24.060
is. "Oh. maybe

"Do I really want
to ruin his life?"

514

[Dennis] Right. Well.

515
00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:36.139
he was very good at grooming

516
00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:38.475
because he groomed you
to think that.

517
00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:42.078
It puts a lot of confusion.
I think. in my mind

518
00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.079

- Like. if you're...
- [Dennis] Right.

525
00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.925
You know. his sense of sexuality

526
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.560
is fully developed at that age.

527
00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.896
he's not going to suddenly
not be attracted to kids.

528
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.064
that's not going to end.

529

Not unless he gets caught.
it won't end.

533

You know. I might have stopped
for a while.

535

536
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.213

sheet music to practice.

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:40.783

[Gwen] Yeah. I definitely
started to get sick here already.

the psychologist.

and nothing worked

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.393
I feel like she just
understood me

667
00:54:57.427 --> 00:55:00.663

and tried to forget

668
00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.931
about the eating all together

669
00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.300

670
00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.501

"It's not about that."
and that gave me...

674
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.940
That made me trust her.

down my throat.

to the surface

685
00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:55.351
so it resulted
in an eating disorder

686
00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:57.453
and severe depression.

687
00:55:57.487 --> 00:56:01.523
anxiety. you know.
night terrors. nightmares.

688
00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:06.195
There was all this going on
in my life at that time.

689
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.065
It made me physically sick.

690
00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:13.135
I've been in and out
of hospitals since then.

691
00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:16.705
Things I can't really
explain except for stress.

692
00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.742
I mean.
I was just in the hospital

693
00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:21.410
for two weeks.

694
00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:23.045
I mean. stress into stroke.

695
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.582
And I'm kind of young
for all that...

696
00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:32.855
[Denis] <i>After the molesting.</i>

697
00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:35.257
<i>the big thing is use the trust</i>

698
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:36.592
<i>to keep her quiet.</i>

699
00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:44.400
<i>This is secret.
don't tell anybody.</i>

700
00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:46.034
You don't want
to get grandpa in trouble.

701
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.669
Then I won't see you anymore.

702
00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.405
You know.
we can't go and do things.

703
00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.240
You know. and I build that up
a little bit more.

704
00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:52.641
You know?

705
00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:55.577
Uh. but getting somebody
to tell you something

706
00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:57.513
that she hasn't told
anybody else

707
00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.348
or he hasn't told anybody else

708
00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.916
and then holding that.

709
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:04.086
you know. so that you know
that if you ever tell on me.

710
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.587
I'm going to tell on you.

711
00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.423
I go back and forth
on everything.

712
00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:09.558
he explicitly said.

713
00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.794
"don't tell anyone.
you need to keep it a secret."

714
00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.962
But it was...
It was just really clear

715
00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.497
that it was supposed
to be a secret.

716
00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:17.599
I don't know how I knew
or why I knew.

717
00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:19.435
but I knew to not say anything.

718
00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.236
[Barbi] Like.
why didn't I say anything?

719
00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:23.439
They must've said
something to me

720
00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:26.008
to convince me
not to say something.

721
00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.410
They start with little secrets.

722
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.746
they're testing to see
if you'll keep the secret.

723
00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.648
- Oh. interesting.
- So it might be

724
00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:34.249
that he takes you some place

725
00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.617
that you weren't supposed to go

726
00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:37.553
or gives you a little tiny gift

727
00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:40.155
that he can explain away
if it ever comes to light.

728
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.558
And so there's
this building up to secrecy.

729
00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:45.394
You start with ones. you test.
"Okay. will he hold that one."

730
00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:48.831
Then "will he hold that one?"
That's grooming. Straight up.

731
00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:53.702
He started putting extra money
in my pay checks every week.

732
00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:56.238
He would say. "Oh. just
don't tell anyone about this.

733
00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:57.940
This is
just between me and you."

734
00:57:57.974 --> 00:58:00.309
I just remember him
always saying

735
00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:02.044
"Don't trust other people.

736
00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:03.312
Don't talk to other people

737
00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:05.447
about what happens
in the house."

738
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:09.518
My dad asked
why I didn't tell him...

739
00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:25.968
I had to keep telling myself.
"Okay. I'm a good girl.

740
00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:26.869
I'm a good girl.

741
00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:29.171
I'm still a good girl.
it's okay.

742
00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:31.173
I'm okay. I'll be okay."

743
00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.676
But for some reason I just...

744
00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:40.382
I felt like I shamed
the family somehow.

745
00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:42.751
So I didn't want
to talk about it.

746
01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:14.543
[typing]

747
01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:24.886
Whoever is a sex offender
is going to deny.

748
01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.389
They're great at lying.

749
01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:28.790
they're the best at lying

750
01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.359
and it's funny
because when I was younger

751
01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.893
that's when I started lying.

752
01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:34.363
"Did you do that?"
"No. I didn't do it."

753
01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:37.666
As I went through life
it got easier. you know?

754
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.637
And it just got to be
a part of my being. I guess.

755
01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:46.208
The part of me that is groomed

756
01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.777
would expect him to be arrested.

757
01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:53.782
go in and say.
"I'm so sorry that I hurt her."

758
01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.885
I never intended to do so.

759
01:00:56.919 --> 01:01:00.389
I really loved her.
cared for her.

760
01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.658
and I'm so sorry to hear

761
01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:05.160
"that this is the impact
that it's had on her."

762
01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.996
That would be consistent
with the person that I saw

763
01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:12.234
and the person that portrayer
care for me and love for me.

764
01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.503
He is taking a stance
against me.

765
01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.839
makes me see
a different side of him

766
01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:20.108
and it's almost
like he's ungrooming me

767
01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.778
in a way. it's making me see

768
01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.613
he maybe more for what he is

769
01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.748
versus how he portrayed himself

770
01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.150
towards me for all those years.

771
01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:32.254
That's just exactly
why it's good

772
01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:33.488
to have the knowledge

773
01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:37.025
of maybe you've seen two sides
of the person.

774
01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.630
That helps.
That helps to clear confusion.

775
01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:43.799
He doesn't even want to admit

776
01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.701
to have sent me the letter.
are you kidding me?

777
01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:53.308
[music]

778
01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:06.955
I got pregnant as a result
of the abuse of my father.

779
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:08.623
Um...

780
01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:12.961
<i>I was 15.</i>

781
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:19.067
<i>He tried a natural remedy
for an abortion.</i>

782
01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:23.205
Aspirin mixed
with some other things

783
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:27.876
and that then
led to him taking me

784
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.344
to an abortion clinic

785
01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:36.184
when I was pretty far along
in the pregnancy

786
01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:40.722
and I was awake while
the procedure happened.

787
01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.291
He even said.

788
01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.595
"You should be thankful

789
01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:49.064
that your dad brought you here.

790
01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.867
there's not a lot of parents
who would do that."

791
01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.035
Um...

792
01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.774
That moment I think shaped

793
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.410
the beginning of me. like.

794
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.248
really separating
in a way from him.

795
01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.790
<i>He got a sentence of 20 years.</i>

796
01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:18.426
[Gwen] How did it feel
when he was convicted?

797
01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.086
[Denis] <i>I just got off of work.</i>

798
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.655
<i>it was 6 o'clock in the morning</i>

799
01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.057
<i>and as I was driving home.</i>

800
01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:51.827
whoever was on back on me.
kept following me.

801
01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.328
And I started to get nervous.

802
01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.430
When I came around.
I pulled on my driveway.

803
01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.800
in front of me there's
the state police.

804
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.602
Federal officers.

805
01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.703
I'm like.
"How am I going to lie?

806
01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:02.838
What am I going to say?"

807
01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:05.440
I didn't even think
about what I did yet. I mean.

808
01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.375
I did it. but now
I want to get out of it.

809
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.211
I sat down with my head
between my legs

810
01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:12.414
and I though.
"My God what did I do?"

811
01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.416
You know. "What's..."

812
01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.385
I'm thinking of prison.

813
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.988
the bars and these crazy guys
that are there.

814
01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.590
I mean. all these things
went through my head

815
01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.025
and I get a call.

816
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.861
and I'm thinking
"Who is this now?"

817
01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:26.795
I answered it

818
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:28.864
and it was
my step-granddaughter.

819
01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:29.865
She's the one I molested.

820
01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:31.533
She says. "Grandpa." you know.

821
01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:32.400
"I'm sorry

822
01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:36.004
that I had to get you
in trouble."

823
01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.205
You know? I mean. see?

824
01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.974
The lies I told her.

825
01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.343
she was actually feeling
so much guilt

826
01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.278
because of that.

827
01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:45.513
You know.
she was apologizing for.

828
01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.915
you know. doing the right thing.

829
01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:40.655
I want to share something
with you

830
01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.290
that happened this morning.

831
01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:44.459
Um...

832
01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.228
You're. like. the second person

833
01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:48.496
that I'm telling.

834
01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:51.466
and I got an e-mail this morning

835
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.403
completely out of nowhere
from a girl in the same team

836
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.704
who said.

837
01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.807
"Are you talking
about this person?

838
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.075
Cause this happened to me."

839
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.244
And it just. I don't know.

840
01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.612
It just broke my heart.
you know?

841
01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:09.584
But I think
I've never been prouder

842
01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:12.420
that I reported or proud
of anything I've done.

843
01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.889
maybe. after when I got
that e-mail

844
01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.001
I just thought
I did the right thing.

845
01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:17.025
you know?

846
01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:22.564
I would be interested
in hearing your process

847
01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.800
of how you did that because
I've never reported anything.

848
01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.902
I think for everybody
the process is different

849
01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.304
and what is right is different.

850
01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:30.572
I don't think there is an answer

851
01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.240
for everybody that's the same.

852
01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.042
But in my case. it was hard.

853
01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.778
It was so hard to talk about it

854
01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:38.379
and to go through the question.

855
01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:39.581
They told me
that if this happened

856
01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.916
it is a crime
and a really serious one.

857
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.454
[sobbing]

858
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.603
Now I feel
more motivated also to go

859
01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:05.173
and appeal
and tell the prosecutor

860
01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.307
that they're wrong. It's like.

861
01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:08.009
"You've got to get this guy
off the street."

862
01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:10.512
I didn't really
feel that before.

863
01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.881
Before I was. "Oh. I didn't
validate me a little bit.

864
01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.182
Maybe I didn't want
to take it seriously.

865
01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.450
then you start feeling like.
doing it."

866
01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.719
Now. I'm like "Go get this guy.

867
01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:18.853
Go get him now."

868
01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.296
<i>I was told
that to have any chance</i>

869
01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:31.166
<i>of reopening my case
I needed to do two things.</i>

870
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.601
try to get DNA on the letters.

871
01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:34.969
Even though the prosecutors

872
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.304
said they couldn't find any DNA.

873
01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:37.539
try to find it.

874
01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.175
<i>and then try to get
a handwriting sample from him</i>

875
01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.677
<i>to match to the writing
of the letters.</i>

876
01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.513
<i>As a first step
I took the letters to a lab.</i>

877
01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.015
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you. thank you.

878
01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.149
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

879
01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.886
[Gwen]<i> We are looking</i>
<i>for a second opinion.</i>

880
01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.389
We have evidence
in the form of letters.

881
01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:57.358
but they're not able to match
the suspect to the letters.

882
01:09:57.393 --> 01:09:58.893
And so what we want
to try and see

883
01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.028
is there really no DNA.

884
01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:02.330
cause we still have
the stamp on the card.

885
01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.299
Does that mean
that the stamp was no tested?

886
01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.333
Would you take it out?

887
01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:08.036
Usually if we would test
the stamp on DNA

888
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.671
then we would.
indeed take it out.

889
01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.172
Especially
if it's an old letter.

890
01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.541
maybe the person
who left the DNA licked it.

891
01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:15.543
- Mm-hmmm.
- And it's well isolated

892
01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:18.746
on the card so it would be one
of the best places to start.

893
01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.549
So is my DNA
going to be all over?

894
01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.518
Your DNA is definitely
going to be there

895
01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:24.786
- if you touched it.
- Right.

896
01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.987
So I think it would be best

897
01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.722
if we take a reference sample
of you too.

898
01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.730
It takes about four weeks
until we send the answer.

899

[doorbell rings]

901
01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:00.221
Hey.

902
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.907
[Gwen]<i> Raimondo told me</i>
<i>it would probably</i>

903
01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.242
<i>take a while before he would get</i>

904
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.578
<i>the right opportunity
to get a handwriting sample.</i>

905
01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:25.913
<i>But in the meantime.</i>

906
01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.181
<i>he found out that my offender</i>

907
01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.384
<i>lives just five minutes away
from my parents house.</i>

908
01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.755
<i>He had blacked out
all his windows.</i>

909
01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:36.224
<i>He never married
and he doesn't have a family.</i>

910
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:40.094
<i>He found out that he remained</i>

911
01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:42.797
<i>at the swim club for years
after I left.</i>

912
01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:45.066
<i>and as recently
as three years ago</i>

913
01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.634
<i>he was working at summer camps.</i>

914
01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:51.939
I'm a little nervous.

915
01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.342
Well should I get straight
to the point then?

916
01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:57.979
Yes. Let's do it the Dutch way
and get straight to the point.

917
01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.782
Okay. So as we investigated

918
01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.151
five of your letters
that you gave

919
01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:09.157
and we found two profiles.
one female profile.

920
01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:12.327
which was yours

921
01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.362
and so there was one other
profile too.

922
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.998
And is it a male profile?

923
01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:19.267
Unfortunately.
I'm not able to say

924
01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.635
or disclose that

925
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:23.805
because of the regulation
with respect of privacy.

926
01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.506
- Okay.
- Same profile

927
01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.175
on three different items.

928
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:28.910
Yeah.

929
01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:30.178
That's really good news.

930
01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:32.580
Yeah.

931
01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:33.748
It's a great result.

932
01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.516
especially after such
a long time

933
01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.918
that we were able
to find something.

934
01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:39.787
It was rather quite
a clear profile.

935
01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.256
It's really good news. so...

936
01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.925
Yeah. I think
it's the best result

937
01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.026
that you could've hoped for.

938
01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.661
Thank you.

939
01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.129
- Okay.
- Have a good day.

940
01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.577
I have zero...
There's zero part of me

941
01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.379
that feels bad for him.

942
01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:06.280
Literally. there's nothing.

943
01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.388
<i>After weeks of surveillance.</i>

944
01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.390
<i>Raimondo finally
had his opportunity</i>

945
01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:16.991
<i>to try and get
the handwriting sample</i>

946
01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:17.892
<i>we needed.</i>

947
01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.747
[music]

948
01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.119
[Gwen]<i> When I saw</i>
<i>the handwriting sample</i>

949
01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.222
<i>that Raimondo was able to get</i>

950
01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:56.457
<i>I was amazed
at how similar it was</i>

951
01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.493
<i>to the handwriting
I had been so familiar with</i>

952
01:14:58.527 --> 01:14:59.460
<i>as a little girl.</i>

953
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:06.534
[music]

954
01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:33.194
It feels a little bit
like a point in time

955
01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:36.697
where I have now truly done
everything I can

956
01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:40.501
and there's no possible move
for me to make

957
01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.104
<i>other than going
to the prosecutor and saying.</i>

958
01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:44.539
<i>"This is everything we found."</i>

959
01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.107
<i>Please take a look and see</i>

960
01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:47.375
<i>"if you want to reopen the case."</i>

961
01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.976
<i>That's all we can ask for.</i>

962
01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:50.444
I don't want him to be out there

963
01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.647
and just be able to do
whatever he wants

964
01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:55.049
and go to summer camps
just because nobody

965
01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.050
is trying hard enough.

966
01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.853
<i>Now we have to wait and see.</i>

967
01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:13.200
[Denis] I'll probably
never stop crying about it.

968
01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.603
but I understand
it a lot better.

969
01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:18.105
I can't change the past
and what I did.

970
01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.875
so if you're going
to evaluate me.

971
01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.743
evaluate before you see now.

972
01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:23.711
You know that kind of thing?

973
01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:26.280
I want to be that better person

974
01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:27.782
and I know I am.

975
01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:30.318
but I still have
those thoughts. you know?

976
01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:32.887
That I did do that.

977
01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:54.642
Tell me how you're feeling.

978
01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:10.958
And one thing
we talked about a lot

979
01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:13.928
is the need to separate
the healing process

980
01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.363
from the legal process.

981
01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:17.598
That's one of the biggest
learnings I've had.

982
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.468
You know. if nobody validates me

983
01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.003
and if he never goes to jail

984
01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.605
or if he'd never gotten arrested

985
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.807
that doesn't mean
that I can't heal.

986
01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.309
I feel better. I feel stronger.

987
01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.911

<i>"You just seem so much lighter."</i>

992
01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.956
<i>Like I don't have
that weight on me.</i>

993
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.692
<i>I mean. I still...
There's days that are hard.</i>

994

just been able</i>

<i>to go through with it</i>

996

<i>my story
it's made such a difference.</i>

998
01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:55.369
It's just so powerful to feel
like you're not alone in it.

999
01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:56.671
<i>Thank you.</i>

1000
01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.840
As the abuse ended.

1001
01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:03.544
I had a very difficult time

1002
01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:07.248
connecting with my own
first name. Keith

1003
01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:11.652
because my first abuser.
his name was Keith.

1004
01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.688
And so I used
my grandparent's name.

1005
01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.491
35 years I've been using
that name

1006
01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.326
and it's only recently

1007
01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:21.796
that I've been able
to feel more comfortable

1008
01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:23.998
with my name

1009
01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:27.968
and having been able
to integrate

1010
01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:30.137
full three names.
now I feel complete.

1011
01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:32.339
Now I use Keith Renard Brennen.

1012
01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:35.843
And feel comfortable with that.

1013
01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.579
I try to put myself
in a position

1014
01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.881
where childhood abuse.
that whole experience.

1015
01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.683
was the worst part of my life.

1016
01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:45.753
There seems to be
a future beyond
