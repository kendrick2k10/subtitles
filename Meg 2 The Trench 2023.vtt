00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.881
What's up favorite niece?

4
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.300
I'm supposed to tell you not to be
late for the party tonight.

5
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.053
Of course.

6
00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.867
As the great poet Song Lian said...

7
00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:21.079
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

8
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:26.084
My father named me Jiuming.

9
00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:29.254
which means ocean

10
00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:30.422
or abyss.

11
00:10:33.342 --> 00:10:37.220
My father and my sister
spent their lives studying the ocean.

12
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.641
It wasn't until they were both gone
that I began to wonder

13
00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.144
what my purpose was.

14
00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.480
But through Suyin's daughter Meiying.

15
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.231
I saw that there was a future.

16
00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:53.904
I merged my father's research institute
with my company

17
00:10:55.197 --> 00:11:00.035
to carry forward our tradition
of exploring the unknown in their honor.

18
00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.083
To mark this tenth anniversary.

19
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.127
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

20
00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.054
Her name is Haiqi.

21
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.973
She is the world's only megalodon
in captivity.

22
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.601
We found her injured as a pup.

23
00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:28.063
Thanks to Haiqi. we've learned a
tremendous amount about the megalodons

24
00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.606
as well as the trench where they live.

25
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:56.925
Protecting the ocean is crucial.
for China and all mankind.

26
00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:58.510
Thank you.

27
00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.111
Do you think there are more creatures
to be discovered down there?

28
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.029
There has to be.

29
00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.686
Uncle. are you crazy?

30
00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.456
Slowly. slowly.

31
00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.125
Total success.

32
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.795
Uncle! Are you crazy?

33
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.380
It's all right. I'm good.

34
00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.921
Yes. whenever you're ready?

35
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.925
These new suits will let us travel
anywhere and at any depth underwater.

36
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.349
No worries. no worries.

37
00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.650
Mom and Grandpa talked about you
all the time.

38
00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.362
Nothing good I suppose.

39
00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.656
Wanna guess?

40
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.284
See this scar?

41
00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.871
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

42
00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:44.958
So I snuck out to swim with my friends
on the rocky shores...

43
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.752
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

44
00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.296
When I returned home
my father taught me a real lesson.

45
00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.050
- Grandpa?
- Of course.

46
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.177
He was kind to you
because you're his granddaughter.

47
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.471
but he was tough on me.

48
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:03.810
So after college. I started a company.

49
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:07.355
I wanted to get away from him.

50
00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:11.234
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather for many years.

51
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.195
Then he asked your mom
to bring me this calligraphy.

52
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.156
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

53
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.826
I thought it was a form of ridicule...

54
00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:25.582
but I came to realize that he wanted me
to find my own way.

55
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.378
Like the dragon...

56
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:33.172
I hope you can find your own fate.

57
00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.988
What the hell are you doing?

58
00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:18.463
Uncle. I thought you--

59
00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:21.550
You're not going to get rid of me
that easily.

60
00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:26.599
Hold on!

61
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:06.113
Karma will get you.

62
00:56:13.662 --> 00:56:14.663
Shut up!

63
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.509
I don't think I can make it!

64
00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:57.219
You can do it. It's ok.

65
01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:47.394
We're going to die!

66
01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:48.479
It's ok. it's ok.

67
01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.185
Thank you for working.

68
01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.565
Very funny.

69
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.676
I know you're looking for me and Jonas.

70
01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:23.219
I also know you don't speak Chinese.

71
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.181
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys.

72
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.058
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

73
01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.937
Can you put your phone down?

74
01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.315
After all these hard years
we're finally on vacation.

75
01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.358
savor the moment.

76
01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:58.114
I've already got 400 likes.

77
01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:24.599
Come over.

78
01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:26.601
What?

79
01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:31.105
What are you doing?

80
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:38.738
Yaoyao...

81
01:17:41.616 --> 01:17:42.909
Will you marry me?

82
01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:49.082
Find it. idiot!

83
01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:50.917
Wait!

84
01:17:53.044 --> 01:17:54.379
Have you found it?

85
01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:43.923
Go back!
Don't go into the water!

86
01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:45.216
There's a shark!

87
01:36:05.886 --> 01:36:07.137
Hang on. Meiying!

88
01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:32.305
Throw me the bomb!

89
01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:36.101
Catch it!

90
01:44:01.027 --> 01:44:02.612
Next time don't run around. ok?
