375
00:27:16.547 --> 00:27:19.028
It ain't. That's a thing
we call Y'at.

376

Guns. All I saw was guns.

384
00:27:44.053 --> 00:27:47.056
I mainly just kept my head down.
I didn't wanna...

385
00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:48.710

[laughs]

436

00:34:29.763 --> 00:34:32.853
The assailants are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

520
00:34:34.246 --> 00:34:37.466
Now. let's go to George.

525
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.391
-Oh. yeah.
- And with good reason.

526
00:34:50.478 --> 00:34:51.958
-Today's tragic events--

527
00:34:52.045 --> 00:34:53.612

528
00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.918
Got some fool on the line

529

Told me to tell ya.
he's willing to chat.

537
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:43.967
It's a good location
to dump a car.

538
00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:46.100
You got 90 only seconds away.

539
00:35:46.187 --> 00:35:48.537
and the Irish Channel
to get lost in. right there.

540
00:35:49.843 --> 00:35:51.584
So. what's next?

541
00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:55.718
We flex this. Okay?

542
00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:56.893
So what do we know?

543
00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.678
Three shooters. One's hurtin'.

544
00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:00.723
Two of 'em are
probably local boys.

545
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.377
All ex-military.

546
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:05.685
Not just military...
these guys are gunfighters.

547
00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:08.862
We're lookin' for vets
with trigger time
in the sandbox.

548
00:36:08.949 --> 00:36:10.646
I'll get Jean
to reach out to DOD.

549
00:36:10.733 --> 00:36:13.171
-And I'll pull Jefferson
and Orleans' barrage.
-Good.

550
00:36:14.694 --> 00:36:16.478
So what exactly was the take?

551
00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:19.220
Walked out with three mil.
got away with one point five.

552
00:36:20.917 --> 00:36:23.659
What was a bank in East Calhoun
doing with that much cash?

553
00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:25.487
They just took over
the temp headquarters branch.

554
00:36:25.574 --> 00:36:28.186
because the CBD location
was going through a remodel.

555
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:30.840
And today's Thursday.

556
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:34.496
So. they were carrying
heavy prepping' for distribution

557
00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:35.976
to all the other branches.

558
00:36:36.063 --> 00:36:38.065
Cover all those
Friday payroll checks.

559
00:36:38.413 --> 00:36:39.980
And. how do they know all this?

560
00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:41.677
That's our job.

561
00:36:43.679 --> 00:36:46.204
You mentioned earlier.
an Edwin Smalls...

562
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:48.380
That's right. The rat.

563
00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:50.643
Smalls gave them intel
and boards.

564
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.035
What kind of boards?

565
00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:53.515
Some high-end. custom stuff.

566
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:55.648
designed to trigger
the alarm system

567
00:36:55.865 --> 00:36:58.520
-to shut itself off 15 minutes
before the crew hit the place.
-Okay.

568
00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:01.306
I followed up on that
with the bank's security firm.

569
00:37:01.393 --> 00:37:04.352
They told me that they found
two odd. custom boards

570
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:06.485
installed in the master CPU.

571
00:37:06.572 --> 00:37:09.531
They're polygraphing
the entire staff as we speak.

572
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:13.840
So if Smalls hadn't talked.
they'd have gotten away clean?

573
00:37:13.927 --> 00:37:15.276
Hundred percent.

574
00:37:16.364 --> 00:37:17.626
Hmm...

575
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:20.281

Put him over here.
Put him over here.

Sorry 'bout the mess. man.

-Would you just chill out. man?!

He's just droppin' off a
pepperoni.

But I hate pepperoni!

He's down. but it's a shit deal.

Not good.
So how we gonna do this?

This dude has lost
a shit ton of blood.

My guess is the bullet
bounced off his shoulders.

start gettin' down
to his stomach.

626
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.249
His abdomen is distended.
and he's got a G.I. bleed.

And. uh. he's in rough shape.
but the bleeding stopped.

639

for no rest.

ASAP.

Get him over to Bill's house.
He can rest when we get there.

-Got a deal.

and we will know. You hear me?

send for us.

where the fuck that is. Jamie--
-Listen--

667

It's in South America.
and there's this big lake
down there.

Right on the Bolivian.
Peruvian line.

by the Andes Mountains.

there's this little island
called Isla de Sol.

no roads.

Just fishermen and farmers.

00:43:33.828 --> 00:43:36.831
All right? You. me. and Joan
could start a life there.

-Who the fuck are you?

687

I'm nobody.

688
00:45:03.962 --> 00:45:05.833
Funny.
I was just thinking that.

689
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.314
Yo. let's just fucking do
this. 'aight?

690
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.620
Check this shit out.

691
00:45:21.153 --> 00:45:23.242
-Good. brother?
-Yeah. we good.

692
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:25.505
Yo. homie. You. uh...

693
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.726
you're a little light.
don't you think?

694
00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:31.380
How do you figure?
That's five hundred K.

695
00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:36.124
-I'm sure it is.
-[Brill] That's thirty percent.

696
00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:39.084
-Yes. it is.
-Yo. that's what we agreed to.

697
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:42.565
What the fuck did you just say?

698
00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:44.437
It's the only fucking deal
on the table.

699
00:45:44.524 --> 00:45:45.830
We didn't have no choice.

700
00:45:46.395 --> 00:45:47.919
What. you didn't think you need
to run that by me first?

701
00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:49.442
[Brill] Do we have a problem?

702
00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:51.313
Yeah. we got a fucking
problem. hold on.

703
00:45:51.574 --> 00:45:54.229
If you about that action.
just say the word.

704
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.536
Yo. we're good!

705
00:45:56.623 --> 00:45:58.625

best get your bitch in line--

709

What the fuck did
you just say?

710
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:13.118
You heard what the fuck I said!

711
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.644
Yeah. fuck 'em.
Come on.

All right. okay. All right.

Oh. shit!
All right. Get down.

Yo. Nussy. Boss.
I don't know how
to tell you this.

-Tell me what?
-The meet went ugly.

737
00:48:55.671 --> 00:48:57.195
Brill's gone.

738
00:48:57.847 --> 00:48:59.066
What you mean "gone"?

739
00:48:59.153 --> 00:49:01.895
Gone. White boys executed him.

740
00:49:01.982 --> 00:49:03.810
Knocked off everyone.

741
00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:08.162
Nah. Not everyone.

742
00:49:09.555 --> 00:49:12.993
Nussy. Yo! Wait!
Let me explain.

743

Nah. I can't hear nothin'.

744

Nah. still nothin'.

Wait. what? I don't get it.

747
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.528
'Cause if I could hear you.
you'd be an apparition.

A what?

749
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:31.142
A fucking ghost. nigga.

750
00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:34.710
If I could hear you.
you'd be a motherfucking ghost.

751
00:49:34.797 --> 00:49:36.190
At least that's what
you're gonna be

752
00:49:36.277 --> 00:49:37.670
when Stitches
delivers you to me.

753
00:49:37.887 --> 00:49:40.455

756
00:49:47.332 --> 00:49:48.681
Yes. sir.

757
00:49:58.082 --> 00:50:00.519
[handcuffs rattle]

758
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:17.275
Look man. I'm tellin' you.
I ain't wanna help him.

759
00:50:17.362 --> 00:50:19.799
Not one damn bit.
But I had no choice.

760
00:50:19.886 --> 00:50:22.845
-He put a fucking Glock
to my head.
-A glock?

761
00:50:23.716 --> 00:50:26.110
Yes. sir. Saw it written
right on the side.

762
00:50:26.197 --> 00:50:28.982
Had a shiny pearl handle grip.
It--

763
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:32.333
Oh. yeah?
Did it have any engraving in it?

764
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.814
You know on that...
shiny pearl handle.

765
00:50:34.901 --> 00:50:36.685
Yes. sir. Yeah. it did.

766
00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:38.992
Had a grim reaper
carved in on it.

767
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:40.428
Really?

768
00:50:40.515 --> 00:50:42.865
That sound like something
you lie about?

769
00:50:42.952 --> 00:50:44.345
Then. they put the gun

770
00:50:44.476 --> 00:50:46.130
in my mouth.
and pulled back the handle.

771
00:50:46.217 --> 00:50:47.696
[Nicotra]
Wait. they put it in your mouth?

772
00:50:47.783 --> 00:50:49.481
I thought you said
they put in to your head.

773
00:50:49.568 --> 00:50:52.440
Look. he put it to my head.
then in my mouth.

774
00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:55.139
All right? Then the crazy
son of a bitches start arguing

775
00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:56.836
about which one's
gonna get to pull the trigger.

776
00:50:56.923 --> 00:50:58.359
-Holy shit!
-Mmm!

777
00:50:58.533 --> 00:51:00.144
Put it in your mouth.
and pulled it out...

778
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:02.276
Man. I swear for God.
can you believe that shit?

779
00:51:02.363 --> 00:51:03.582
[Frank] No.

780
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:07.020
No. I don't.

781
00:51:09.675 --> 00:51:10.937
Who are you?

782
00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.422
You ever heard
of the Pinocchio effect?

783
00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:21.643
The pokey no fect?

784
00:51:22.383 --> 00:51:24.690
No. no. [laughs]

785
00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:27.214
Pinocchio.

786
00:51:27.432 --> 00:51:31.175
You know. the cute wooden puppet
that wished he was a real boy?

787
00:51:31.697 --> 00:51:34.047
Every time he told a lie.
his nose would grow.

788
00:51:34.134 --> 00:51:35.831
Man. I told you.
I swear for God.

789
00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:38.007
What do I have to gain
from lying to you?

790
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:40.227
You see. Edwin...
Mind I call you Edwin?

791
00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:41.489
You see...

792
00:51:41.968 --> 00:51:45.667
The Pinocchio effect is
when someone's lying.

793
00:51:45.754 --> 00:51:47.060
they know they're lying

794
00:51:47.234 --> 00:51:49.062
So they're working
as hard as they can

795
00:51:49.149 --> 00:51:51.064
to convince you.
that they ain't.

796
00:51:51.499 --> 00:51:53.849
They start babbling.
and going on...

797
00:51:53.936 --> 00:51:57.157
Start spitting out more details.
more words. than necessary.

798
00:51:57.244 --> 00:51:58.898
You know. shit like.

799
00:51:58.985 --> 00:52:01.248
'Do you think I'd lie
about something like that?'

800
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:03.903
Or. 'What do I have to gain.
lying to you all?'

801
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.383
Whoa.

802
00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:08.168
Wait... what do you think
I'm lying about?

803
00:52:08.777 --> 00:52:10.257
[Frank] Everything.

804
00:52:11.258 --> 00:52:15.349
For one. a Glock's
a polymer pistol. It's plastic.

805
00:52:16.176 --> 00:52:17.786
You can't add grips to it.

806
00:52:17.873 --> 00:52:19.919
Especially no pearl handle ones.

807
00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:24.793
And. second. it's a striker
fire. hammerless--

808
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.492
Which means there's no hammer
to pull pack on. dumbass.

-[grunts]

810
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:31.539
[Nicotra]
What the fuck is wrong with you.

811
00:52:31.757 --> 00:52:33.150
you about to have a stroke
or something?

812
00:52:35.326 --> 00:52:37.545
I have neither the time
nor the crayons

813
00:52:37.632 --> 00:52:39.243
to explain all this to you.

814
00:52:39.852 --> 00:52:41.854
But. I'm gonna give it a go.
anyway.

815
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:44.813
What you're unaware of is.

816
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.033
earlier this afternoon.

817
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.687
those crazy sons of bitches.

818
00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:51.559
that you supplied the intel
and the boards to.

819
00:52:51.646 --> 00:52:54.083
pulled a North Hollywood
shootout.

820
00:52:54.954 --> 00:52:59.045
They murdered six officers
and put another
in critical condition.

821
00:52:59.611 --> 00:53:02.788
Which makes you an accessory to.
at minimum...

822
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:05.312
Six counts of capital murder.

823
00:53:08.533 --> 00:53:11.840
Now. you're realizing
the gravity of your situation.

824
00:53:11.927 --> 00:53:16.062
All right. look. I had no
fucking idea. all right?

825
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:17.933
They were supposed to go in
on the prowl.

826
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.631
Break in the night before.

827
00:53:19.718 --> 00:53:21.328
Look. I had no idea
they were gonna kill no one.

828
00:53:21.415 --> 00:53:23.722
-all right?
-I'm sure the state of Louisiana

829
00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:26.072
would really appreciate
that explanation.

830
00:53:29.554 --> 00:53:31.295
Oh. fuck me.

831
00:53:31.382 --> 00:53:33.862
Yeah. yeah. that's about right.

832
00:53:36.561 --> 00:53:38.476
All right. look. look...

833
00:53:38.563 --> 00:53:39.868
What can I do. all right?

834
00:53:39.955 --> 00:53:41.522
Tell me. tell me...
What can I do?

835
00:53:41.609 --> 00:53:43.655
Tell me 'bout your customers.

836
00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:46.266
These guys that put you
in this hole.

837
00:53:46.353 --> 00:53:50.139
Okay. it was. uh.
two White dudes.

838
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.706
I think they might've
been brothers.

839
00:53:51.793 --> 00:53:53.273
How'd you come
to that conclusion?

840
00:53:53.969 --> 00:53:55.754
They kept calling each other
bro and shit.

841
00:53:55.884 --> 00:53:57.103
What are you. fucking Redman?
Who do you know in this city

842
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.452
who doesn't call each other bro?

843
00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:00.237
It was different than that.
all right?

844
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:01.934
Look I just-- I feel like
they were brothers. All right?

845
00:54:02.021 --> 00:54:04.066
-They kind of looked alike.
-Okay. okay.

846
00:54:04.153 --> 00:54:07.548
This is good. Tell me more
about these brothers.

847
00:54:07.635 --> 00:54:12.118
All right. uh. they. uh...
The younger one
was the smart one.

848
00:54:12.771 --> 00:54:16.818
Okay? And--and...
The older one was the mean one.

849
00:54:16.905 --> 00:54:18.864
What made the smarter one
smart?

850
00:54:18.951 --> 00:54:21.040
He was just--
all about business.

851
00:54:21.127 --> 00:54:22.650
He wanted
to know the details.

852
00:54:22.737 --> 00:54:24.304
Very specific about the details.

853
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:25.653
And the mean one?

854
00:54:27.176 --> 00:54:28.613
Oh. oh. he was bad news.

855
00:54:31.616 --> 00:54:33.966
You know. some wild eyes.

856
00:54:34.053 --> 00:54:36.621
He's the type of guy
that's lookin' for any excuse

857
00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:39.667
to hurt someone.
All right? He told me.

858
00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:41.843
if I ratted on him.
he'd find me.

859
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.281
and leave me twitchin'
in my own pile of shit.

860
00:54:44.368 --> 00:54:46.892
And... he was...
very. very specific

861
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:48.589
about the pile of shit.

862
00:54:48.676 --> 00:54:51.679
Okay. I believe you.
Keep going.

863
00:54:51.766 --> 00:54:53.464
Okay... uh...

864
00:54:55.944 --> 00:54:59.861
The smart one
had a Saint Jude pendant
around his neck.

865
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.428
And. uh...

866
00:55:03.038 --> 00:55:07.086
the mean one had a...
Marine corps tattoo.

867
00:55:07.173 --> 00:55:10.959
It said Semper Fi.
it had writin' on it.

868
00:55:11.656 --> 00:55:13.179
What did the tattoo say?

869
00:55:15.877 --> 00:55:18.619
It said Semper Fi somethin'
on the bottom.

870
00:55:18.706 --> 00:55:21.056
-And. then. Sheridan somethin'.
on top.
-Say what?

871
00:55:21.143 --> 00:55:24.146
-It said Semper Fi
on the bottom.
-No no no... the name

872
00:55:24.233 --> 00:55:26.845
Oh. uh. Sheridan Raid.
or something.

873
00:55:26.932 --> 00:55:29.064
I remember 'cause of the tank.
Okay?

874
00:55:29.543 --> 00:55:31.719
-That mean somethin' to you?
-One second--

875
00:55:31.806 --> 00:55:34.853
So. should I have lawyer here.
or something?

876
00:55:35.506 --> 00:55:37.290
Norma. look.
I need you to drop everything.

877
00:55:37.377 --> 00:55:38.770
and run two names for me.

878
00:55:41.947 --> 00:55:44.166
Listen. I understand how
and why you built the boards.

879
00:55:44.253 --> 00:55:47.039
But. how did you know about
the Thursday deposits?

880
00:55:48.083 --> 00:55:49.868
How did you know that branch
was temping

881
00:55:49.955 --> 00:55:51.696
as a headquarter branch?

882
00:55:51.783 --> 00:55:53.785
Look. I don't know nothing
about no headquarter branch

883
00:55:53.872 --> 00:55:55.961
and no Thursday deposit either.

884
00:55:56.048 --> 00:55:58.267
Yeah. yeah.
Okay. send me that. right now.

885
00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.270
[cell phone beeps]

886
00:56:02.489 --> 00:56:05.318
-This them?
-Yeah yeah yeah.
Fuck yeah. that's them.

887
00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:08.016
Look. that's the mean one.
and that's the smart one.

888
00:56:15.023 --> 00:56:17.504
Hey. what's that mean.
what about... what about me?

889
00:56:17.983 --> 00:56:19.724
Man. what the fuck. man.
we good?

890
00:56:20.812 --> 00:56:23.292
Michael "Mick" Sheridan
and Jamie "James" Sheridan.

891
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.859
Irish White trash
from the Channel.

892
00:56:24.946 --> 00:56:26.513
I popped Mick and his
younger brother years ago

893
00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.341
in an agg assault.
they damn near killed a guy.

894
00:56:28.428 --> 00:56:30.082
The brother walked.
but Mick got sent off to Angola

895
00:56:30.169 --> 00:56:31.605
for seven years.

896
00:56:31.692 --> 00:56:33.172
Both are ex-Marines
from the sandbox.

897
00:56:33.259 --> 00:56:35.435
All right. get a bulletin
to all of our agencies.

898
00:56:35.522 --> 00:56:38.220
-And get these photos
to the media ASAP.
-Copy.

899
00:56:38.307 --> 00:56:40.092
-Any word on the bank employees?
-Not yet.

900
00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:41.528
I'll rattle
Jean's cage again. though.

901
00:56:41.615 --> 00:56:43.051
Follow up now.

902
00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:53.453
-What happened?
-Mick happened.

903
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.237
That's what the fuck happened.

904
00:56:58.327 --> 00:57:00.068
What is she talkin' about?

905
00:57:01.983 --> 00:57:04.638
And. Jamie...
Why do you have all the money?

906
00:57:04.725 --> 00:57:07.380
We had to move.
We had to dump it.

907
00:57:08.686 --> 00:57:10.688
Do you have any idea
who that was?

908
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:15.910
That was Brill Waynes.
Nussy's brother.

909
00:57:15.997 --> 00:57:17.695
-[whispers] Nussy...
-We are so dead.

910
00:57:17.782 --> 00:57:19.479
It's okay. We're fine.

911
00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:21.220
Yo. we're better than fine.

912
00:57:21.307 --> 00:57:23.788
Everybody's share
just got a serious fucking bump.

913
00:57:23.875 --> 00:57:25.485
Where we at with the island?

914
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:28.836
Hey. the passports.
where we at?

915
00:57:28.923 --> 00:57:30.185
[Jamie] What's the matter?

916
00:57:30.272 --> 00:57:31.622
You're not gonna be happy

917
00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:33.232
till we're all dead.
anyway. right?

918
00:57:33.537 --> 00:57:36.670
-What?
-[Jamie] Look. I get it.

919
00:57:36.757 --> 00:57:40.195
Mick. you've always wanted
a warrior's death.

920
00:57:42.415 --> 00:57:44.461
I ain't afraid of dying. bro.

921
00:57:44.548 --> 00:57:47.072
Yeah. no. no.
we all know.

922
00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:53.557
If we do get out of this.
we go our separate ways.

923
00:57:55.428 --> 00:57:57.474
We're never
gonna see each other again.

924
00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:02.261
-Bro.
-[Jamie] Don't bro me.

925
00:58:02.609 --> 00:58:04.829
You ain't thinkin' straight.

926
00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:09.268
I've never been more clear
in my whole life.

927
00:58:10.138 --> 00:58:11.836
Every pile of shit
I've ever stepped in

928
00:58:11.923 --> 00:58:13.011
is because of you. Mick.

929
00:58:22.542 --> 00:58:24.283
Who got you the money for Joan?

930
00:58:28.461 --> 00:58:30.768
Who got you outta
hell in Providence?

931
00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:42.040
How many beatings
I took for you from our old man?

932
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:46.740
You owe me.

933
00:58:50.744 --> 00:58:51.745
No.

934
00:58:55.009 --> 00:58:57.098
After tonight. the debt's paid.

935
00:58:58.273 --> 00:59:01.320
Hey... Hey!
I'm your fucking brother!

936
00:59:02.582 --> 00:59:04.410
What. that don't mean
nothin' to you?

937
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:11.286
This is about her. right?

938
00:59:13.462 --> 00:59:16.117
You gonna let that fucking bitch
come between us?

939
00:59:26.171 --> 00:59:27.476
Say that again.

940
00:59:29.043 --> 00:59:31.263
What? Bitch?

941
00:59:36.703 --> 00:59:38.096
[groans]

942
00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:42.666
[door opens]

943
00:59:43.884 --> 00:59:46.452
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
Bro!

944
00:59:46.539 --> 00:59:49.498
Stitches. baby!
I was just about to call you!

945
00:59:56.201 --> 00:59:58.682
Two local men have been
identified as shooters

946
00:59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.988
in today's brutal bank robbery.

947
01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:03.774
Their names are
Michael Sheridan.
41 years of age.

948
01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:06.864
and his brother.
James Sheridan. 35 years.

949
01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:09.518
Both own extensive rap sheets.

950
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.347
Both men are former
United States Marines.

951
01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:15.568
Having served deployments
in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

952
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:18.049
The FBI robbery task force unit

953
01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:19.746
is said to be closing in
on them.

954
01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:22.314
As we report to you
this evening.

955
01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.148
All right. so I just
got off the line with Jean.

956
01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:31.845
Something did pop.

957
01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:34.152
One of those bank tellers.
that pretty brunette?

958
01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:37.764
Ava Rishoto.
she grew up in Irish Channel

959
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.593
Now. she only had
a couple of dings

960
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.029
in her sealed juvie record.

961
01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.249
-Such as?
-Petty theft at 13.

962
01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:45.729
and a P.I. at 15.

963
01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:49.515
Eh. there's more.
I told you Jean was digging.

964
01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:51.865
So he pulls the bank accounts
on all of 'em.

965
01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:54.651
And she's got over
75 grand in deposits.

966
01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.783
Three weeks after they
pulled that job in Metairie.

967
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.481
-So. you followed the money?
-All digital.

968
01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:02.528
Something called. uh.
Secret Angels.

969
01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.269
It's one of those
anonymous sites

970
01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:06.227
where you
crowdfund sad stories.

971
01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:09.100
Now. all the money did go
to pay the hospital bills.

972
01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:11.450
And nothing else
looks suspicious.

973
01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:14.018
She's still carrying her house
and her car note.
But...

974
01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.760
those dates matchin' up
like that. that just...

975
01:01:16.847 --> 01:01:19.327
-makes for one hell
of a coincidence.
-Hey. Givens!

976
01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:21.112
-What you workin'?
-You ain't heard?

977
01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:23.157
-[Nicotra] Heard what?
-Narcotics on the scene.

978
01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:25.507
They've got six baggers
on the ground in Central City.

979
01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:27.509
-Look's like it's Nussy's group.
-How do you figure?

980
01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:28.815
Your boy Brill is one of 'em.

981
01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:30.469
When'd this happen?

982
01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:32.645
Shit. the bodies
ain't even cold yet.

983
01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.038
I gotta roll.

984
01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.042
What's a Brill?

985
01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:39.478
Only the little brother

986
01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:41.132
to the biggest gangsta
in the wards.

987
01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:43.003
-[Frank] Really?
-Yeah.

988
01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:45.614
[Frank] Big enough gangsta
to wash one point five mil?

989
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.486
[Nicotra] He'll definitely
be on the list.

990
01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:49.009
Where can we find this Nussy?

991
01:01:49.096 --> 01:01:50.750
Well. he's got a club
over on Magazine.

992
01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.012
Show me.

993
01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:03.415
-[heavy breathing]
-[gun fire]

994
01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:06.984
[Ava] Jamie.

995
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:13.904
[rapid gunfire]

996
01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:17.951
Jamie...
Jamie!

997
01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:22.390
-Jamie!
-[Mick] Yo. yo! Okay.

998
01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:25.916
-Hey...
-Jamie!

999
01:02:26.003 --> 01:02:28.135
-[Mick] You okay?
-Jamie.

1000
01:02:29.528 --> 01:02:33.575
[Mick] Bro?
Hey. yo. yo. you good?

1001
01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.143
You okay?

1002
01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:40.191
Jamie. fucking.
I'm so fucking sorry. bro.

1003
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:46.980
Bro.
I'm so fucking sorry.

1004
01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:50.462
I got this. bro. I do.

1005
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:52.333
I'm--I'm gonna tell 'em
it was me.

1006
01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.249
You just ain't gettin' it. man.
No matter what you say.

1007
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:58.383
they're just gonna kill us.
anyway. [coughs]

1008
01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.082
[coughs]

1009
01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.693
Ava!

1010
01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:07.566
Hey...

1011
01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:13.354
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:03:15.313 --> 01:03:17.228
[door creaks]

1013
01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:36.464
Hey. bro.
It wasn't them.
It was me.

1014
01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:39.076
It was all me.

1015
01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:41.948
Is that right?

1016
01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.519
Hey.
there's more money than this.

1017
01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.216
A lot more money.

1018
01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:50.957
Oh. yeah?

1019
01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:53.612
Yeah. Just let her go.

1020
01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:03.448
-Yeah. this one?
-Yeah. even trade.

1021
01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:06.320
-Hey. hey--
-Come on. man--

1022
01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:07.713
Hey!

1023
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.020
Even fuckin' trade. man.
A million cash.

1024
01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:13.371
-I stashed it.
-[whimpers]

1025
01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:17.244
No. it ain't gonna happen.

1026
01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:18.550
Come on. what the fuck's
wrong with you?
