00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:29.833
- Any questions?

171
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.208
Can I get a cawww!

172
00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:33.458
ALL STUDENTS: [unenthusiastic] Caw!

173
00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.792
- Can I get a cawww!

174
00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:36.750
STUDENTS: [louder] Cawww!

175
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.833
- Let's go learn.

176
00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.375
- My uncle said his friend would do.
like. a handstand

177
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.375
on a barrel of beer until he choked.

178
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.958
- Yeah. It's called a keg stand.

179
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.958
GIRL: What's a keg?
[boy sighs]

180
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.333
- Man. did I misread the room.

181
00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:54.917
- Oh. I thought it was funny.

182
00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:57.042
- Thank you. Andrew.
but I don't need your sympathies.

183
00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.750
I was just rejected by my peers.
and I'm in a bit of a fragile state.

184
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.833
- [whispering] I heard if you do Molly
and drink a Mountain Dew.

185
00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:06.125
you start to see the future.
but it doesn't even pertain to you at all.

186
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:06.917
BOY: Really?
- Yeah.

187
00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:09.875
- My older cousin saw
some random dude in Wisconsin's future.

188
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:12.250
- Other Man's Future Syndrome. Sick.

189
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.958
- I don't know. man. I worked
really hard to get into Brown.

190
00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.083
- Man. fuck college! What is this.
the '90s? We have the internet.

191
00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.208
- Even if I wanted to go.
our parents will never let us

192
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.625
skip out on their tradition.

193
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.792
- Look. Griffin.
I love our parents. right. I do.

194
00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:26.250
But I'm not spending another Binge

195
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.167
at "Soda-Pop Game Night"
doing the Root Beer Goat.

196
00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:29.333
I won't do it.

197
00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.833
- What are you wearing?
You look like my bubbe's couch.

198
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:34.500
- Okay. see. you know nothing
about style. right.

199
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.750
You don't. Which is why I took the liberty

200
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.500
of getting you
your very first Gauntlet outfit.

201
00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:41.500
Here we go.

202
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.917
Overalls. baby. Happy Binge. pal!

203
00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:46.208
GRIFFIN: FBF?
HAGS: Mm-hmm.

204
00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:47.500
First Binge forever!

205
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.250
- Hags. I'm not Binge-ing. man.
I'm definitely not wearing overalls.

206
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.000
Please take them back. Please.
- Okay. see. you are Binge-ing.

207
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.083
and overalls are chick magnets. man.

208
00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:56.792
They say if you keep it tight up top.

209
00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:58.375
below the waist. it's anyone's guess.

210
00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.125
- Who says that?
Who says that about overalls?

211
00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:02.083
- I do. And Lena's gonna love 'em!

212
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.167
- I heard if you eat mushrooms
and sacrifice an animal.

213
00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:06.125
your entire world turns into a musical.

214
00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:10.000
- There's no way that's true. Kathleen.

215
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.500
- Is that how you wanna end up?

216
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.375
PROTESTERS: Hey hey. ho ho--

217
00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:15.000
GRIFFIN: Hell yeah. man. we can beat that.

218
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.083
When we win the Gauntlet tonight.
I want our names to be etched in stone.

219
00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:18.958
- Will you put that away?

220
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.708
Principal Carlsen's gonna see it.
and there goes any shot I had with Lena.

221
00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:23.208
- Who gives a fuck. Griffin?

222
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.000
You think he'd want some scared kiss-ass

223
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.875
who volunteers to clean up shits
in the chem lab date his daughter?

224
00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:29.667
No! He wants a man!

225
00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:32.000
Come on now.
Gotta you show you the closer.

226
00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:33.958
- The closer?

227
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.375
- So you know my senior shop project
I told you I was working on?

228
00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.375
- Yeah. man. the one you had
the GoFundMe for

229
00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:40.292
when you were building
the reusable hydration systems

230
00:09:40.292 --> 00:09:41.250
for third world countries.

231
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.917
I was really proud of you for doing that.

232
00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:45.833
- Yeah. man. fuck hydration. I lied.
I put that money to much better use.

233
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.500
- I donated $75.

234
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.833
- Griffin. I give to you the most
important invention since the toilet.

235
00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:52.542
[tarp rustling]
The BoozeCycle!

236
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.000
- Whoa. man. You built this?
- Yeah. man.

237
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.792
- This is awesome.

238
00:09:57.792 --> 00:09:58.708
- Isn't it great?

239
00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:01.125
- Imagine if you put your mind
to something useful.

240
00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.792
- Useful? This is the most
useful thing I've ever done.

241
00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:06.083
Is it a car? Kind of.

242
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:08.167
Is it a bicycle? Almost.

243
00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:09.792
Griffin. this thing fucks!

244
00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.583
- I mean. it does. It's really cool.

245
00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:14.667
It's just. how would we even pedal it
with two people? There's ten seats.

246
00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:18.333
- Hey. why you gotta be so negative. bro?

247
00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:21.792
<i>- And El Pantera. that's just a myth.</i>
<i>Like Santa Claus.</i>

248
00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:24.208
GRIFFIN: You know what <i>.</i> man. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be a Debbie downer.

249
00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:27.542
I'm just-- I'm nervous. you know.
Aren't you scared? Like. at all?

250
00:10:27.542 --> 00:10:29.542
- Scared of what? Becoming a legend?

251
00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:31.625
- No. of just-- I don't know. Everything.

252
00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:33.958
Lena. Carlsen. alcohol poisoning.

253
00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.875
our lives turning into a musical.

254
00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:36.708
That sounds terrible.

255
00:10:36.708 --> 00:10:39.792
- Griffin. we'll be fine. I'll be
with you every step of the way.

256
00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:40.875
- That's what I'm scared about.

257
00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.708
- Ha ha. Oh. okay. you make jokes.

258
00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.292
but you don't realize that
I'm a human. with emotion.

259
00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:45.292
and it hurts my feelings.

260
00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:47.083
- I love you. okay. I really do.

261
00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:49.000
And I appreciate you
getting me a wristband

262
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.208
and stealing from all those people
who desperately need clean water

263
00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:52.250
to build a BoozeCycle--

264
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.292
- Which is awesome.
- It is.

265
00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:54.958
but I'm just gonna stick to tradition.

266
00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.625
do Root Beer Goat-Night with our parents.
and wake up tomorrow

267
00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.333
to continue my extended reign
as mayor of Virgin City.

268
00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:01.708
- Good to know. Mr. Mayor!

269
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.958
- Lena! Hey.

270
00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.750
- Lena. please don't call him Mr. Mayor.

271
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.083
Mr. Mayor is his father.

272
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.667
I like to refer to my brother here
as <i>Babe: Pig In The City.</i>

273
00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:11.833
- Hmm.
- Because he's got
the thickest hog in the game.

274
00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:12.375
- That's not--

275
00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.375
- I've never once heard anyone
refer to him as Babe.

276
00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:15.875
and I've known him since preschool.

277
00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.000
- That's 'cause they whisper it to him.
- They don't do that.

278
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.833
They don't whisper anything.

279
00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:22.083
- So. you whisper "Babe"
into Griffin's ear

280
00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.083
because he has
the thickest hog in the game?

281
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.250
- Okay. Lena. This is weird now.
Right? So I'm gonna go.

282
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.708
Lena. Babe.

283
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.000
- I have a normal-sized hog.

284
00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.500
probably no different than the next one.

285
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.000
Not that I've seen.

286
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.417
uh. but naturally you do find yourself
in positions where you see other hogs

287
00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:47.625
and in those situations. I found that...

288
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.333
my hog is...

289
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.042
comparable. if not the same

290
00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:53.875
in thickness to those--

291
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.500
- That's good to know.

292
00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:59.708
Um... so are you gonna Binge?

293
00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:02.042
- After your dad's speech?

294
00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:04.333
You'd have to be a certified dip-shit
to go out tonight.

295
00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:06.542
- Well. I guess I'm the mayor
of Dip-Shit City

296
00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.708
'cause I'm seriously thinking about it.

297
00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:10.375
- Me too. by the way.

298
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:13.417
I was completely joking before
about the dip-shit thing. That's--

299
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:15.167
But. um...

300
00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:19.000
- Griff. is everything okay?

301
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.375
- It is. Uh--

302
00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:25.375
You know how our moms used
to go to Zumba class together?

303
00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:28.958
- Yeah! Yeah. we used to play
fake house in the kid's room.

304
00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.500
To this day. no one makes
fake French toast as good as you.

305
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.792
- And no one did our fake taxes for
our fake mortgage better than you. so--

306
00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:37.000
- And now we're fake home owners!

307
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.292
- That fake debt collector
won't stop hounding me!

308
00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:41.458
[laughing]

309
00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:44.167
Um. anyways. I was just thinking how

310
00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:45.417
we've always been in each other's lives.

311
00:12:45.417 --> 00:12:47.750
- Yeah.
- And. um.

312
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.750
Lena. I was wondering if--

313
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.875
[Lena shrieks]

314
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:50.792
- Oh my god!

315
00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:52.333
What is this?

316
00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:54.708
"This promposal you can't ignore.

317
00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:56.083
"because there's still so much more.

318
00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:57.875
"Let's laugh and be merry.
because the next clue you'll find

319
00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:58.917
"at the Carnegie Library!

320
00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:01.250
Here's hoping you will attend.
and while you're at it. bring a friend!"

321
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.292
Holy shit!

322
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.667
Griffin. did you do this?

323
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.083
- Um--

324
00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:09.792
- Are you kidding me? Oh my god!

325
00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:11.250
When did this happen
and why didn't you tell me?

326
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.250
- No. no. no. it is happening right now.
You are witnessing it.

327
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.625
- This is awesome.
- Who do you think did it?

328
00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:18.042
- I don't know! Um. Max Keiser?

329
00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:19.417
- Maybe it was Ian Greenstein?

330
00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:20.875
- Ian Greenstein? Yeah. he--

331
00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:22.708
He liked your tweet 18 months ago
like a total creep.

332
00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:24.167
I bet it's Ian Greenstein.
- So many guys!

333
00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:25.542
- I know!
- Exciting.

334
00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:28.792
- Holy shit! This is huge. They sold out
for this. like. six months ago.

335
00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:31.875
- Griffin. would you be
the ultimate friend and take a pic?

336
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:32.833
- Totally.
- Thank you!

337
00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:34.208
- Yeah. I can do that.
- Thank you!

338
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.875
- Say "Ian Greenstein.'

339
00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.542
BOTH: Ian Greenstein!

340
00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:39.792
- You guys are gonna really like that.

341
00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:41.125
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

342
00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:44.708
So that's-- So--
LENA: Okay. bye. Griffin.

343
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:46.667
BECKY: Who do you think did this?

344
00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.417
[girls giggling]

345
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.292
SARAH: The package
is basically fully stocked

346
00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.875
with. like. colorful frozen drinks
and tiny umbrellas.

347
00:13:56.875 --> 00:13:58.583
- I fucking love tiny umbrellas.

348
00:13:58.583 --> 00:14:00.333
Do you think pink drinks. too. because

349
00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:03.000
[blowing trombone]
my grandmother's seen this show.
it's called <i>Sex and the City.</i>

350
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.417
and they would just drink pink alcohol
and have meaningless sex

351
00:14:06.417 --> 00:14:08.833
with strangers of foreign descent.

352
00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:10.833
- I would do disgusting things
to a foreign guy tonight.

353
00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:12.500
- Hmm.
- I'm talking full spit roast.

354
00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:13.792
[clattering]

355
00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:15.958
[students shouting]

356
00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.167
HAGS: Oh my god. I'm so sorry.

357
00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:18.792
- Hags. what the hell is wrong with you?

358
00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:22.625
- I'm so sorry. I just dropped my passport
somewhere around here earlier today.

359
00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:25.167
I'm just trying to get right back
to the motherland right after I graduate.

360
00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:27.583
BOTH: What?

361
00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:29.375
- Oh. my homeland.

362
00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:30.958
You know I'm
a hundred percent foreign. right?

363
00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.000
Like. from another place.

364
00:14:32.917 --> 00:14:37.125
Ha ha. Anyhoo. will I be seeing
you ladies at the Library Party tonight?

365
00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.917
- You're going to the Library Party?

366
00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.792
- Hell yeah I'm going
to the Library Party.

367
00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:42.958
And I'm hoping that you'll check me out.

368
00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:44.917
- For what purpose?
- Excuse me.

369
00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.708
- Uh. isn't that a saying?

370
00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:49.292
- No. it's not.
Words have consequences. Hags.

371
00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.042
- Okay. that's what it is.
It's the language barrier thing.

372
00:14:52.042 --> 00:14:53.583
That's what... that's what it was.

373
00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:56.292
Because I'm from another place.
I'm fully foreign.

374
00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:58.708
- Have you ever even been on a plane?

375
00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:00.583
- Hell yeah I've been on a plane.

376
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.000
Ha ha. Of course.

377
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.833
I'm actually a current cardholder
of the mile high club.

378
00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:06.500
- Oh yeah?
- And the big dick club.

379
00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:08.500
- [gasps] Really?
HAGS: Mm-hmm.

380
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.958
- Well. why don't you whip it out
and show us?

381
00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.833
- Mmm. You see. I would.

382
00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:15.083
but they keep the band room real cold.

383
00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:17.292
It's not really a accurate depiction
of my genitalia.

384
00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.042
BOTH: Hmm.

385
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:18.917
- That's what I thought.

386
00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:20.083
Virgin.

387
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:21.833
This is dry.
- Okay.

388
00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:25.208
CARLSEN: Chad. how are we?

389
00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.333
Kurt. how come I never see you
with your shorts off?

390
00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:28.750
Seem a little locker room shy.
- KURT: S-- Sir--

391
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.083
- Wanna see how a man walks around
the locker room?

392
00:15:30.083 --> 00:15:31.500
KURT: Um--
- Wanna take a look at it?

393
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.833
I'll pull my pants down. I'll go take
a shit. I'll get in the shower.

394
00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:34.583
You wanna watch it?

395
00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:37.333
Whatever it is. get comfortable with it.
It ain't going away.

396
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:39.125
Let's get behind those ears.
okay. Bennett?

397
00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:40.792
BENNETT: Yes. sir.
- That's where the germs live
and they reproduce.

398
00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:41.917
BENNETT: Got it.
- Don't be a pussy.

399
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.917
Chin up. Griffin. my man. how are you?

400
00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:44.958
- How's it going. Principal Carlsen?

401
00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.667
- Well. I'm always a little bit on edge
when it comes to Binge night.

402
00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:49.625
people get pushed to their moral limits.
- Me too.

403
00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.375
I. I can't believe people Binge.

404
00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:53.250
- One shake and you're done. Tommy!

405
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.875
No one wants to watch
your dickplay in here.

406
00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:57.667
At your age. you're a hair-trigger.
You're liable to blow all over the place.

407
00:15:57.667 --> 00:15:59.958
Have a story about you for the rest
of your life. You want that?

408
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.125
Put the dick down.

409
00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.042
TOMMY: Okay.

410
00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:05.875
- You know. Griffin. uh. Lena says
some really nice things about you.

411
00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:07.125
- She does?

412
00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:09.250
- Yeah. She says that you're nice.
that you work hard.

413
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.667
that you have
pretty terrific table manners.

414
00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.667
You know. I'll tell you. Griff.

415
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:17.583
I'm pretty okay
with... my daughter being friends

416
00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:19.417
with a nice Brown man.

417
00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:22.792
Let me walk that back just a little bit.

418
00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:25.792
That's not the kind of quote
that you want taken out of context.

419
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:30.292
Congratulations on getting into
a great university. Brown.

420
00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:32.958
- Thank you. sir. And thank you again
for making that call to Dean Eckhouse.

421
00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.000
It really made all the difference.

422
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.417
- Well. Griff. you know.
when you have a history of

423
00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:38.458
recommending
outstanding guys. like yourself.

424
00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:40.042
they tend to listen to you.

425
00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:42.875
And by the same token. if you ask them
to rescind someone they're thinking about.

426
00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:45.000
they go ahead and they listen loud
and clear on that as well.

427
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.542
Since we're talking
about scratching each other's backs.

428
00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:51.542
I have just the smallest little itch

429
00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:53.500
I was wondering if you could get
your fingernails on.

430
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.625
It's called where the fuck
is the party tonight?

431
00:16:56.625 --> 00:17:00.875
Sarah Martin's "Dank-Ass Pre-Game"
is already on my radar.

432
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.375
I understand they're thinking
of smoking a little bit of pot.

433
00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:05.625
Maybe some Lean? A little Purple Drank.

434
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.375
You know what I'm talking about?
- Oh. I do. but I wouldn't.

435
00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:10.375
I personally wouldn't sniff glue
or drink Purple Drank

436
00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:12.042
or just associate
with Sarah Martin at all.

437
00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:12.792
- Well. that's good.

438
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:14.208
That bitch has chaotic energy.

439
00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:15.792
She's like a scorpion in a toaster.

440
00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:20.417
Anyway. the point is
if you hear of anything--

441
00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:21.292
- Of course.

442
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.000
- Fair?
- Totally fair.

443
00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.875
- Fair?
- Fair. Very fair.

444
00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:26.750
[wristband clicks]

445
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:28.208
- The hell is--

446
00:17:32.542 --> 00:17:35.000
- Principal Carlsen. I-- Um--

447
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.083
[clears throat]
It's a funny story. I-- Uh--

448
00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:40.375
[clears throat] I--
- Oh.

449
00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:44.917
Oh. Actually. Principal Carlsen.
that's not Griffin's.

450
00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:46.333
No. see. I found that in the hallway.

451
00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:48.500
and I gave it to Griffin
to hold onto it for me.

452
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.417
Yeah. I just had no idea what it was.

453
00:17:50.417 --> 00:17:53.000
Could it be tickets
to a renaissance fair or...

454
00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:54.625
a petting zoo.

455
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.833
GRIFFIN: Yeah.

456
00:17:57.833 --> 00:17:59.167
- You gentlemen be safe tonight.

457
00:17:59.167 --> 00:17:59.917
- Yes. sir.

458
00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:01.542
- And Hags. do me a favor.

459
00:18:02.458 --> 00:18:04.708
Try to find a nickname
that's a little bit more normal.

460
00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:06.375
Something like Lucas or Quan.

461
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.167
I'll see you Tuesday? Thirty minutes?

462
00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:11.125
Thank you. Quan. Griff.

463
00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:15.208
David. thank your brother
for the meatloaf.

464
00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:15.833
DAVID: Yes. sir.

465
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:17.917
- Whoa. thank Christ.

466
00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:18.792
CARLSEN: Oh. Griffin?
- Yup.

467
00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:21.000
- You know. there's a prank turd
in the chemistry lab.

468
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.583
I was wondering if you could be an angel.
sweep in and scoop that up.

469
00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:24.583
- I would love to do that.

470
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.417
- Thank you. Quan.

471
00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:31.458
[door opens. closes]

472
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:34.417
- Fuck! Quan?

473
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:35.875
Who the fuck is Quan?

474
00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:38.042

Whoo!

493
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:28.667
Yeah.

494
00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:31.875
- Oh. To our sixth Binge Night Game Night!

495
00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:33.375
- Yep.
- What a great tradition!

496
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:34.375
- This is fun.

497
00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:36.667
- It's just great being able to hang
with family on the night

498
00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:38.583
when nobody else is doing
anything awesome.

499
00:19:38.583 --> 00:19:42.000
- Oh. and we are just grateful
that you boys would rather--

500
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.292
- Uh... men!
CHESTER: Excuse me.

501
00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:46.125
That you <i>men</i>

502
00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:50.292
would still rather pal around
with us middle <i>-</i> aged fogies

503

the other high school boys and girls.

00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:55.292
- Yeah. well. makes me hopeful
for the future.

505
00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:57.458
- Yep.
- Well. who's ready for round two?

506
00:19:58.042 --> 00:19:58.917
- Yeah.

507
00:19:58.917 --> 00:19:59.875
- We don't have to do
the thing again. Dad.

508
00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:00.917
We don't--
CHESTER: Oh no. let's do it.

509
00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:02.583
Root beer goat!
- Ha ha!

510
00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:04.458
[all bleating]

511
00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:08.125
- Ah. somebody didn't goat.

512
00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:08.583
[gasps]

513
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.958
- Well. everybody goated so I--

514
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.542
- Come on. son. you do the best goat.

515
00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:12.625
- I do a very normal goat.
- No. you--

516
00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:14.125
- Come on. give us a goat!

517
00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:15.792
Give us a goat!
- You're so good.

518
00:20:15.792 --> 00:20:17.333
[high-pitched bleating]

519
00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:18.792
[laughter]
STACY: You got it.

520
00:20:18.792 --> 00:20:19.958
- This is what I'm talking about.

521
00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.417
- That's a damn good goat!

522
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.083
So. Griffin. I heard you're going to prom
with the Principal's daughter?

523
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:26.042
GRIFFIN: Oh.
PAUL: Prom.

524
00:20:26.042 --> 00:20:28.708
- Yeah. I. I was.
but somebody else already asked.

525
00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:29.875
[sympathetic groans]

526
00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:31.292
- That's too bad.
KARYN: I'm so sorry.

527
00:20:31.292 --> 00:20:32.458
- Oh. it's okay. Ma.

528
00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:34.292
Most. most people
probably don't even remember

529
00:20:34.292 --> 00:20:35.250
who they went to prom with.

530
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.083
- Exactly.

531
00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:37.708
- Unh-unh. you're looking at him.

532
00:20:38.792 --> 00:20:42.250
He was so nervous when he asked me.

533
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.583
He had written a little poem out
and everything.

534
00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:46.167
He didn't even end up reading it.

535
00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:48.917
- Well. for what it's worth.
I always thought

536
00:20:48.917 --> 00:20:50.792
you and Lena made an adorable couple.

537
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.000
Do you want me to call her father?
- That's okay. Dad.

538
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.625
- No. no. no. I'm not afraid to call him.
- I am.

539
00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:55.958
You don't have to do that.
- No. you shouldn't be.

540
00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.000
- I don't think you should do that.

541
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.292
CHESTER: Okay. Okay.
GRIFFIN: I appreciate that.

542
00:20:58.833 --> 00:21:01.750
- Hey. everybody. What's happening here?

543
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.792
Too early to fall asleep.

544
00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:05.500
I bought <i>Big Bang Theory</i> Clue.

545
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.792
<i>- Big Bang.</i>
CHESTER: Mm-hmm.

546
00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:07.417
Let me get this straight.

547
00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:09.750
Sheldon... kills--

548
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.292
- Penny.
CHESTER: Penny.

549
00:21:11.667 --> 00:21:13.792
In the library?

550
00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:14.583
- No.
- The lab.

551
00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:15.500
- The lab.

552
00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:19.083
With a... Galaxy 6. 6S

553
00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:19.833
- Galaxy--

554
00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:22.000
- Eh. 6. Salaxy 6--

555
00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:26.000
[snoring]

556
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.958
- Bazinga.

557
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:29.417
- Mom. Mom?

558
00:21:29.917 --> 00:21:30.583
Dad?

559
00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:32.167
Dad? Dad? Paul?

560
00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:32.917
[Paul snoring]
GRIFFIN: Stacy?

561
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.750
HAGS: Come on. Griffin.
let's get the hell out of here!

562
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.917
- What the-- Wait. what the hell is this?

563
00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:37.625
Hags. did you do something?

564
00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:40.125
- No! I just gave them
a couple sleeping pills.

565
00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:41.667
- You roofied our parents?

566
00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.750
- I did not roofie our parents.
The pills were in their medicine cabinet.

567
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.917
- This is crazy!
- Griffin!

568
00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:48.042
Your parents are spooning.
My dad is snoring.

569
00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:49.292
Mom's asleep. Let's go!
- No!

570
00:21:49.292 --> 00:21:50.917
Tha-- I'm not going. I'm not leaving.

571
00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:53.042
You have a wristband. that's it. okay.

572
00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:54.042
You go without me.

573
00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:55.500
- Go without you?

574
00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:57.917
- Lena's gonna meet
her promposal mate there anyway.

575
00:21:57.917 --> 00:21:59.500
I don't want to witness that.

576
00:22:00.375 --> 00:22:03.083
- Griffin. I was lying
when I said I wasn't scared.

577
00:22:03.083 --> 00:22:04.042
I <i>am</i> scared.

578
00:22:04.375 --> 00:22:06.792
But I'm not scared about
what's gonna happen tonight.

579
00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.500
I'm scared about
what's gonna happen after tonight.

580
00:22:09.417 --> 00:22:10.625
You're going to Brown.

581
00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:13.542
And I'm gonna be stuck here
working at Chuck E. Cheese.

582
00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:14.958
And that's life. Griff.

583
00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:19.625
Look. you go and you beat that
Dr. Seuss promposal asshole to the punch.

584
00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:21.042
You look Lena in the eyes and tell her

585
00:22:21.042 --> 00:22:23.417
exactly what you've wanted
to tell her your entire life.

586
00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.125
Tonight we become legends. Griffin.

587
00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:28.500
We go to that party
and we win that Gauntlet.

588
00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:32.083
This is our last chance
to make a great memory.

589
00:22:34.083 --> 00:22:35.833
- Wow! That was really good.

590
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.583
That was good.
- Thanks.

591
00:22:37.583 --> 00:22:38.750
- Did you practice that?

592
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.708
- A couple of times. Yeah.

593
00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:45.875
- Ughhh!

594
00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:47.708
- I know that groan!

595
00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:49.500
- Ah. I still don't have a wristband.

596
00:22:50.417 --> 00:22:52.458
What is that? Hags. why are you winking?

597
00:22:52.875 --> 00:22:54.125
GRIFFIN: Man.
I just don't know about this.

598
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:56.375
I haven't been over to Andrew's house
since. like. the second grade

599
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.000
when his mom did that thing
with the mousetrap.

600
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.083
- Who cares? He said
he has extra wristbands.

601
00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:02.125
You need a wristband. Ring the bell.

602
00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:04.958
[doorbell ringing]

603
00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:05.917
GRIFFIN: Should we call him?

604
00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.292
HAGS: He don't believe in phones.

605
00:23:08.292 --> 00:23:10.792
[door creaking]

606
00:23:10.792 --> 00:23:11.667
- Hello?

607
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.000
- Hello?
- Hello. hello.

608
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.042
- Hello? Andrew?

609
00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:18.167
Hello?

610
00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:23.833
Hi. Mrs. Hellmuth?

611
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.000
- What do you want?

612
00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:28.000
- Uh. sorry for barging
in your home like this.

613
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.125
Is Andrew here?

614
00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:31.250
- Andrew?

615
00:23:32.083 --> 00:23:33.208
My. uh--

616
00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:34.542
- Your--
- Your son.

617
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.958
- Yeah. Son.

618
00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.208
You're looking for him?

619
00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:41.292
- Uh. yes. ma'am.
It's kind of an emergency.

620
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.875
- You guys cops?

621
00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:46.583
- No.
- No.

622
00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:48.542
GRIFFIN: We're just--
We're in high school.

623
00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:51.042
- Griffin? Hags?

624
00:23:51.042 --> 00:23:52.792
HAGS: Andrew!
ANDREW: Holy shi--

625
00:23:52.792 --> 00:23:54.708
Uh. it's okay. Mom. These are my friends.

626
00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:56.125
- Your friends? Yeah. right.

627
00:23:56.125 --> 00:23:58.083
- I have friends. Mom!
Why don't you believe me?

628
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.958
- Why don't I believe
that you have friends?

629
00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:02.750
Probably because your tendency
towards violence

630
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.833
caused us to be banned
from the fucking church.

631
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:07.375
- You didn't give me
my calming pills! That's why.

632
00:24:07.375 --> 00:24:11.500
- I canceled our family trip to Reno
to pay for your freaking calming pills!

633
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.750
Why do you think your father left?

634
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.667
ANDREW: You said my dad left
to pursue his dreams.

635
00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:17.000
- His only dream was to leave this house.

636
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.417
Happy Binge!

637
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.167
- Fuck you. Mom!

638
00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:24.958
I'll bury you behind a Jiffy Lube.
And my friends are gonna help me!

639
00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.667
- We will not be doing that.
- We're not. we're not gonna do that.

640
00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:27.750
- I mean. I don't even know him now.

641
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.083
- You think I'm afraid
of a couple of <i>puto</i> cops?

642
00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:34.375
I spent 18 years in a Bangkok prison

643
00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:36.875
hanging upside down from my labia.

644
00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.833
Two of those years.
I was pregnant with you.

645
00:24:38.833 --> 00:24:42.083
- That's not even true. Mom.
Who are you trying to impress?

646
00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:44.500
- Take these two guys up to my room

647
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.958
and show them the Chai Ming Fist Bump.

648
00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.000
BOTH:
I don't wanna see that.

649
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.417
- What the fuck does that even mean. Mom?

650
00:24:49.417 --> 00:24:53.000
- I'll burn that tongue if you ever speak
to me that way again.

651
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.750
- Do it!

652
00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:54.667
[flesh sizzling]

653
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:57.042
[both screaming]

654
00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:00.708
DEIDRE: Dinner's in ten.

655
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:03.250
I love you!
- I love you. too!

656
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.083
- Give Mommy a kiss.

657
00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:11.708
- [lisping]
I'm so sorry about that. guys.

658
00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:13.958
- My mom. she just loves
showing off in front of my friends.

659
00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:14.792
[laughing]

660
00:25:14.792 --> 00:25:16.458
- Listen. Andrew.
we're in a bit of a rush.

661
00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:18.833
Uh. we just wanted to know
how much we would have to pay you

662
00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:20.250
for those wristbands
you said you can get us?

663
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.000
- Well. currency is an illusion
influenced by a false reality.

664
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:25.083
I live my life on a bartering system.

665
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:26.458
- Okay. we can work with that.
- Oh.

666
00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:27.417
- So what do you want?

667
00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:29.708
- To be your wingman tonight.

668
00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:31.500
- Well. of course you can. man.
- Really?

669
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.500
- Yeah. That's--
- Whoa. wait a minute.

670
00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:35.667
You see. me and Griffin. we're a duo.

671
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.875
We've never been a trio.
- What are you doing?

672
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.958
- Right. Right. right. right. Okay. okay.

673
00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:42.042
- Andrew. do you mind if Griffin
and I just have a sidebar over here.

674
00:25:42.042 --> 00:25:43.042
Not about you. at all.

675
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:44.542
Is that okay? Thank you.
- What's going on?

676
00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:47.125
- Whoa. we can't bring him. bro.
He's not helping our cool factor.

677
00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:49.875
- And you're doing wonders for
our cool factor bringing bonus overalls?

678
00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:52.708
Look. Lena has a wristband.
Sarah has a wristband! I need a wristband!

679
00:25:52.708 --> 00:25:54.875
And having another person to pedal
that monstrosity outside

680
00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:56.292
wouldn't hurt either.
HAGS: Fine.

681
00:25:56.292 --> 00:25:58.000
Fine. Andrew.

682
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.792
- Yes.
- We're back. Sorry.

683
00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:00.500
- Uh-huh.

684
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.375
What--
- You're in.

685
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:03.208
- Yeah. you can be our wingman tonight.

686
00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:03.750
- What?

687
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.625
GRIFFIN: Yeah.
HAGS: Yes.

688
00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:05.500
- What?

689
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.000
- Oh-kay.

690
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.292
GRIFFIN: Yeah. It's all right.
ANDREW: Oh my god!

691
00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:09.958
Wow! Uh--

692
00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:14.792
I swear... I will not let you guys down.

693
00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:16.042
- How 'bout those wristbands?

694
00:26:16.417 --> 00:26:17.708
- Ah. yes.

695
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:19.333
Actually. I 3D printed them.

696
00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:21.000
I 3D print a lot of stuff.

697
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.667
- Oh. awesome. man. These things--

698
00:26:23.208 --> 00:26:24.750
- Andrew. these are purple.

699
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.500
The Library Party wristbands are orange.

700
00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:29.417
- Yes. Hags. that is
a very good observation.

701
00:26:29.417 --> 00:26:32.917
You see. unfortunately.
the guy I usually barter with.

702
00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:34.625
he was all out of the orange filament so--

703
00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:36.875
- Well. that doesn't help us at all.
- Right. right. right. Uh--

704
00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:39.250
My twin brother Seb has real ones.

705
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.292
- Seb? "The Ice Russian?"

706
00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:44.417
Didn't he go to juvie for stabbing
some guy with a screwdriver?

707
00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:45.833
- Wait. he's your twin brother?

708
00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:47.167
- Yeah. From a different father.

709
00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:51.000
- Excuse me.
- What?

710
00:26:51.708 --> 00:26:54.042
- Heteropaternal superfecundation.

711
00:26:56.208 --> 00:26:57.417
It's actually pretty common.

712
00:26:57.417 --> 00:27:00.042
You see. it's when a woman allows
two random sexual partners

713
00:27:00.042 --> 00:27:02.875
to ejaculate inside of her
during a special two-egg ovulation.

714
00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:06.958
Yeah. And then she has fraternal twins
from two different fathers.

715
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:11.000
So I have a... half-twin brother.
Or a full twin half-brother.

716
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:14.208
Halfernal for short. He's actually--
He's. uh. six days older than me.

717
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.667
I was thinking we'd do the old switcheroo.

718
00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:21.083
All right.
just follow my bullshit.

719
00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:22.875
Okay. guys. listen to me.

720
00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:25.125
No matter what he says. do not sit down.

721
00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:31.750
- Hello! How are you?

722
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.542
Uh. I'm Hags. This is Griffin.

723
00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:35.375
You know Andrew.

724
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:39.958
That's a real beer.

725
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.917
SEB: The fuck is it?

726
00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:46.792
- Go. go.

727
00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:50.708
[dart pops]

728
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.000
- Ah. little brother.

729
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.750
What are you doing here?

730
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.083
I thought you vowed
never to talk to me again

731
00:27:56.083 --> 00:27:58.542
after I made you eat all that tinsel
off the Christmas tree.

732
00:27:58.542 --> 00:28:00.208
- Time heals all wounds. brother.

733
00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:01.833
- Ah. there's always time to make another.
[rips]

734
00:28:01.833 --> 00:28:03.333
- Whoa. Okay. All right.
[dart pops]

735
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.375
Guys. I think we're really getting off
on the wrong foot here.

736
00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:06.375
- Are you cops?

737
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:09.333
- We are literally in the same grade.
Why does everyone think we're cops?

738
00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:10.458
- I don't really know.
[dart pops]

739
00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:13.000
Oh! Uh. speaking of
the Library Party tonight.

740
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.792
we have these really cool
purple VIP wristbands.

741
00:28:15.792 --> 00:28:16.958
but we don't know where the entrance is.

742
00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:18.792
- Yeah. we can't find
any information online.

743
00:28:18.792 --> 00:28:22.292
- Yes. So. we just figured a couple top
cool all-stars like yourselves would know.

744
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.667
- VIP?
HAGS: Yes.

745
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:28.583
- Have a seat.

746
00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:32.208
- We're standers.
- Sit!

747
00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:33.958
- Yeah. we can do that.
- Sure.

748
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:41.333
[snorts]

749
00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:42.958
- Ohh!

750
00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:46.625
Jersey Turnpike?

751
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:48.708
- Jersey Turnpike?

752
00:28:48.708 --> 00:28:50.458
- Half a line of protein.
half a line of creatine.

753
00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:52.000
- That's not even drugs?
- Yeah. why would I wanna do that?

754
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.667
I don't wanna do that.

755
00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:54.708
- If you're not a narc. then you
wouldn't mind doing a Jersey Turnpike.

756
00:28:54.708 --> 00:28:55.167
[airhorn blares]
- Oh!

757
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:56.708
Dude. do the Jersey Turnpike.

758
00:28:57.042 --> 00:28:58.417
[sniffs deeply]

759
00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:04.208
- Whoa... [stammers] that burns a lot.

760
00:29:04.208 --> 00:29:05.042
- Yeah. baby!

761
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:06.958
So let me get this straight.

762
00:29:07.958 --> 00:29:10.917
You come into my personal space
with your purple wristbands

763
00:29:10.917 --> 00:29:13.125
and this talk of VIP.

764
00:29:13.125 --> 00:29:14.958
You think you're what. just gonna.

765
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.833
just waltz out of here?

766
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:19.833
[airhorn blares]
- Oh!

767
00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:24.042
- Well. you got another thing coming.

768
00:29:27.167 --> 00:29:28.625
because I would love...

769
00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.000
to compensate you for those.

770
00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:36.000
Generously.

771
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.917
- Yeah. that--

772
00:29:36.917 --> 00:29:38.042
- How's a grand sound?

773
00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:39.083
- Pssh.
- That works.

774
00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:40.417
- That's a pretty good deal.
- That's great.

775
00:29:40.417 --> 00:29:41.167
- Perfect for us.
- Huh?

776
00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:43.542
- 'Cause no offense.
'cause you're not really the VIP type.

777
00:29:44.917 --> 00:29:45.875
You stand out.

778
00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:47.292
- We totally agree.

779
00:29:47.292 --> 00:29:48.583
Thank you for being so honest.

780
00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:49.750
[airhorn blares]
Oh-kay!

781
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.083
This guy. man. He really likes that thing.

782
00:29:52.083 --> 00:29:54.667
- Okay. so if you guys are good.
I think we're good. We're definitely good.

783
00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:56.500
So I think then that's it.
I think that's it then.

784
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.083
So we'll just swap our VIP wristbands
for your normal ones. And that's good.

785
00:29:59.083 --> 00:30:00.333
These are for you.
- Thank you. Seb.

786
00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:01.750
Give my boy the cash. all right.

787
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.667
It was nice doing business with you.
- Oh. oh. I just have one more question.

788
00:30:04.667 --> 00:30:05.708
Come on.

789
00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:09.042
- It's a secret.
- It's... it's--

790
00:30:11.917 --> 00:30:13.042
- Ahh!
HAGS: Whoa! Whoa!

791
00:30:13.042 --> 00:30:14.083
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

792
00:30:14.083 --> 00:30:15.250
- No. sir! No. we do not.
SEB: Huh?

793
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.333
[groans]
SEB: You come in here.

794
00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:17.750
You try to take the Gauntlet win from us?

795
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.542
You got--
[mini-crossbow whooshes]

796
00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:20.833
Oww!

797
00:30:21.792 --> 00:30:24.250
Oh fuck! Ow!

798
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.208
Wha-- No! What the fuck? Oh. you shot me!

799
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.167
- Now let me friend go!

800
00:30:28.167 --> 00:30:29.333
- I'm not touching him. He's over there.

801
00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:30.667
- Let him go!

802
00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:31.667
- I'm not even near him!

803
00:30:31.667 --> 00:30:33.167
- Give me the wristbands

804
00:30:33.167 --> 00:30:34.667
or the next one's in the breadbasket.

805
00:30:34.667 --> 00:30:35.833
I fucking swear to God!

806
00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:36.917
- Give it to him. Give it to him.

807
00:30:36.917 --> 00:30:37.917
Okay. good. Calm down--

808
00:30:39.042 --> 00:30:41.167
[screams]
GRIFFIN: Oh.

809
00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:45.125
- Oh my god! You shot my dick!

810
00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:46.417
You shot my dick!

811
00:30:46.417 --> 00:30:48.708
- Oh!
- All right. motherfuckers.

812
00:30:48.708 --> 00:30:50.708
- He shot my penis.
- You shot his penis.

813
00:30:50.708 --> 00:30:52.375
- There's gonna be--
- Oww! What the--

814
00:30:52.375 --> 00:30:53.667
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hags.

815
00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:55.875
- Goddammit! You shot me in my neck!

816
00:30:55.875 --> 00:30:56.708
- God. I don't want to look at it.

817
00:30:56.708 --> 00:30:57.792
ANDREW: I didn't mean to! I'm sorry.

818
00:30:57.792 --> 00:30:58.792
- We gotta go!

819
00:30:58.792 --> 00:31:00.208
- Don't pull it out! Don't pull it out!

820
00:31:00.208 --> 00:31:01.583
GRIFFIN: Go! Go! Go!
HAGS: Go!

821
00:31:01.583 --> 00:31:02.250
- Get 'em!

822
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.542
GRIFFIN: We got the wristbands.
Let's go. We got 'em.

823
00:31:04.542 --> 00:31:06.125
ANDREW: I'm sorry!

824
00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:07.458
HAGS: What the fuck?

825
00:31:07.458 --> 00:31:08.000
SEB: Come on. get 'em!

826
00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:10.083
HAGS: Pump it!
MAN: I'm gonna kick your ass!

827
00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:12.458
- It's right on the shaft.
It's right on the shaft.

828
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.750
ANDREW: Did we lose them?

829
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:16.750
GRIFFIN: Do you think we can stop?

830
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.208
HAGS: Ow.
GRIFFIN: I think we're good.

831
00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:19.458
HAGS: Owww!
GRIFFIN: I think we can stop!

832
00:31:21.583 --> 00:31:22.458
Oh!

833
00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:23.667
Oh. that was crazy.

834
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.292
HAGS: Ahh!

835
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.958
Oww!

836
00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:28.583
All right. We're okay.

837
00:31:28.583 --> 00:31:29.875
- That was so crazy.

838
00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:32.250
- I got a dart in my neck!

839
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.917
I have a dart in my neck.

840
00:31:33.917 --> 00:31:36.292
- I'm sorry. Hags. I didn't mean to.

841
00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:37.875
- Griffin. what the fuck is on your face?

842
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:39.917
- What?
HAGS: What's on your face?

843
00:31:39.917 --> 00:31:41.250
Oh! Oh my god.
