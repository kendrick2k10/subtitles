3
00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:15.015
In ancient days.
gods. demons. and mortal men

4
00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.668
walked together on this earth.

5
00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.369
In time. their realms
became separate.

6
00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:26.026
Now all that remains
are the legends.

7
00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:31.596
and the keys to their realms.

8
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:56.317
London. 1381.

9
00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:04.803
Plague and corruption have
spread throughout the land.

10
00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:07.893
and the innocent were taken
to the darkest of places.

11
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:13.508
Newgate Prison.

12
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.704
Newgate was said to
be like hell on earth.

13
00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:37.227
That's how Tyburn liked it.

14
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:42.102
Ulrich Tyburn.
Governor of Newgate.

15
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.194
For over 100 years.

16
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.196
Tyburn was governor of
the infamous prison.

17
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.677
- Bring the girl down.

18
00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:54.288
Using the
prisoners as slaves

19
00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:57.552
to carve out passageways
deep below the city.

20
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:09.781
To a place known only to demons.

21
00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:19.443
Here. they built a great temple

22
00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:22.316
where Tyburn brought
his followers.

23
00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:24.013
Newgate's most evil prisoners

24
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.799
who had sold him their souls.

25
00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.019
becoming slaves to his will.

26
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:37.896
Using an ancient key.
Tyburn opened a doorway.

27
00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:43.815
a doorway to the underworld.

28
00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:48.342
Tyburn wanted to use
the armies of evil

29
00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:51.780
to conquer the world.
and. to free them.

30
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.608
Tyburn had one final task.

31
00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:57.742
the sacrifice of an innocent.

32
00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:00.745
But Tyburn's
impatience had pushed

33
00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:02.443
the people of England too far.

34
00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:05.663
On the day of his
final sacrifice.

35
00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:08.666
a crowd gathered at
Newgate. demanding justice.

36
00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:20.591
- Tyburn!

37
00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:22.550
- You.

38
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.737
- Tyburn!

39
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.480
I have come for the girl.

40
00:04:24.655 --> 00:04:26.614
- Then you are too late.

41
00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:29.269
Soon. she will be dead.

42
00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:31.488
As will you.

43
00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:29.329
Morgan!

44
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:07.802
- I see.

45
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:11.283
Tell me more about
this fellow Tyburn.

46
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.721
Do you feel he was to blame

47
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:15.331
for your attack on Dr. Segalman?

48
00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:19.204
- I never meant to hurt her.

49
00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:21.293
That was a mistake. I was
trying to protect her!

50
00:06:21.293 --> 00:06:22.120
- From what?

51
00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:25.689
- The key. she found the key.

52
00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:26.864
- The key to what?

53
00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:28.562
- Tyburn's key. the key is evil.

54
00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:30.564
They will use it to free Tyburn.

55
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:32.392
She needs my help!

56
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:08.515
Kryssie.

57
00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:09.385
- Gregory.

58
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:13.520
- So good to see you.
- And you.

59
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.608
This is spectacular.

60
00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:16.131
- My London home.

61
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:17.567
Come on in and I'll
show you around.

62
00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:56.258
Lord Woodrow.

63
00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:00.480
- Good evening.

64
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.830
- This is Dr. Segalman.
the eminent archeologist

65
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.571
who discovered the key.

66
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:06.224
Kristina. this is Lord Woodrow.

67
00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:08.009
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

68
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.794
I've been hearing some
wonderful things about you.

69
00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:12.666
- Lord Woodrow has
been very helpful to us

70
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:14.581
on getting permission for our
dig beneath the Old Bailey.

71
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:15.625
- Have you seen the key?

72
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.409
No. not yet.

73
00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:19.194
- Well. look the party
hasn't really livened up yet.

74
00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:21.283
so why don't we take
a sneak preview?

75
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:26.593
Oh!

76
00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:27.594
Oh. sorry.

77
00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:28.986
- Oh. that's all right.

78
00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.510
I'm sorry.
- No. it's my fault.

79
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.120
Really should watch
where I'm going.

80
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.556
Sorry. old boy. you okay?

81
00:08:33.556 --> 00:08:35.819
- Lester!
- I'm sorry.

82
00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:36.646
- Kryssie.

83
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.822
- Lester Rossini.

84
00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:41.999
Is Addie around?

85
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.348
- You two know each other?

86
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:49.006
- Yes. I was engaged to
Lester's brother Addison.

87
00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:50.268
- Addie's not here.

88
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:52.053
Last I heard. he was in Moscow.

89
00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:54.446
- Wheeling and dealing.
- As always.

90
00:08:54.446 --> 00:08:56.623
- Since when were you
interested in archeology?

91
00:08:56.623 --> 00:08:58.363
- I guess it runs in the blood.

92
00:08:58.363 --> 00:09:00.322
what with Addie so fascinated
with old treasures.

93
00:09:00.322 --> 00:09:02.237
- Yes. as I can remember.
that seemed to be

94
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:04.848
all Addison was
ever interested in.

95
00:09:04.848 --> 00:09:06.546
- Lord Woodrow. this is Lester.

96
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.809
He's accompanying my
daughter Phoebe at the party.

97
00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:10.114
Has she given you
the slip. old boy?

98
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:11.289
- Seems that way.

99
00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:12.595
Actually. I better go find her.

100
00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:15.119
It's good to see you again.

101
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.599
- And you.

102
00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:27.349
- Thank you. Gregory.

103
00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:54.985
Where
are you. Lester?

104
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.206
- Lester. darling!

105
00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.120
Phoebe.

106
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.166
- Are you going to
ask me to dance?

107
00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:03.603
We've hardly spent any
time together tonight.

108
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.169
- Well. I-

109
00:10:05.169 --> 00:10:07.302
- Come on. Phoebe. stop
pestering the waiter.

110
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.695
I need a dance.

111
00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:11.741
- Waiter?

112
00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:39.682
It's gotta be one of these.

113
00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:43.947
But not that one.

114
00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:07.188
Come on.

115
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:28.122
- Trouble getting away
from Miss Van Husen?

116
00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:29.950
- Well. what can I say. Addie?

117
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.257
One of us had to have the
old Rossini animal magnetism.

118
00:11:33.257 --> 00:11:34.737
Anyway. I feel like
a cad leading her on.

119
00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:36.391
She's a really nice girl.

120
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:38.132
- Lester. her daddy's
a billionaire.

121
00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:39.786
Money's on the mind of
every man she meets.

122
00:11:39.786 --> 00:11:41.178
- It'd be nice to be
different for a change.

123
00:11:41.178 --> 00:11:42.092
that's all I'm saying.

124
00:11:42.092 --> 00:11:43.267
- No!

125
00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:44.747
We're here to steal the key.

126
00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:46.531
Her daddy might
care. but she won't.

127
00:11:47.663 --> 00:11:49.621
I can't believe you. Lester.

128
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:50.448
- I guess.

129
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.277
- Look. our timing's screwed.

130
00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:54.757
We better communicate
by radio now.

131
00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:55.758
Here. this is yours.

132
00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:57.281
- What. do we have to?

133
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:59.109
I hate having this
thing stuck in my ear.

134
00:11:59.109 --> 00:12:00.720
As if I wasn't uncomfortable
enough wearing this tie.

135
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.069
- Would you stop whinging?

136
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:09.641
Right. what's that look for?

137
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.208
What look?

138
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.862
- Like I just parked
my car on your foot.

139
00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:14.429
- It's nothing. it's nothing.

140
00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:15.996
What is it?

141
00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:17.519
- Kryssie's here.
she's downstairs.

142
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.999
I know.

143
00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:20.174
I see.
you're okay with that.

144
00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.175
- That's ancient history.

145
00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:22.742
We're here to do a job.

146
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.352
- If you say so.

147
00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:26.223
Look. I better be going.

148
00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:27.398
I should return Gregory's
keys before they're missed.

149
00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:28.225
Right. play it cool.

150
00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:29.444
- Cool as ice.

151
00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:31.011
- Lester.
- What?

152
00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:32.055
Your fly's undone.

153
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:34.449
- Oh. very mature.

154
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.677
- The Key of Khnum.

155
00:12:45.677 --> 00:12:47.157
It's early Egyptian by origin.

156
00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:51.074
The key was brought back here
by knights after the Crusades.

157
00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:54.512
- If you look at
these hieroglyphics.

158
00:12:54.512 --> 00:12:56.776
you will see the
story of the key.

159
00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:06.133
The god Khnum was said to
have given up one of his eyes.

160
00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:10.224
which he fashioned into a
pendant as a gift for Osiris.

161
00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:11.660
the king of the netherworld.

162
00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:16.099
Using the eye. Khnum
tried to spy on Osiris

163
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.319
in a plot to overthrow him.

164
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:21.801
but Osiris uncovered his
plan. and. in his anger.

165
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.455
trapped Khnum
inside the pendant.

166
00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:26.936
- But the pendant
in these pictures

167
00:13:26.936 --> 00:13:28.111
is different to this-

168
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:29.809
- Well spotted.

169
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.028
The pendant is
described as existing

170
00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:34.378
of two interlocking pieces.

171
00:13:34.378 --> 00:13:37.425
This part of the key. and
another part called the eye.

172
00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:42.734
How does
all of this lead you

173
00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:44.824
to the dig at the Bailey?

174
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.828
- Well. as you know.
the Old Bailey's built

175
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.482
on the site that was
formerly Newgate Prison.

176
00:13:53.093 --> 00:13:55.835
Recent findings in
Jerusalem suggest

177
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.881
that a prominent figure
from the Knights Templar

178
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:00.578
fled to England with treasures

179
00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:02.450
that may have included this key.

180
00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:05.279
and took residency here

181
00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:13.765
as governor of Newgate.

182
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:21.251
C t .

183
00:14:23.427 --> 00:14:24.254
- Kryssie?

184
00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:26.909
Kryssie?

185
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.826
- Oh. yeah. sorry.

186
00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:35.091
We should
be getting back.

187
00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:36.963
The rest of the guests will
surely have arrived by now.

188
00:14:36.963 --> 00:14:38.486
- Of course.

189
00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:40.705
Well. thank you both
for the history lesson.

190
00:15:30.712 --> 00:15:31.539
- Lester!

191
00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:34.324
Well. I'll be. you're growing

192
00:15:34.324 --> 00:15:35.935
more like your father every day.

193
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.634
except you're thinner. paler.

194
00:15:43.725 --> 00:15:44.944
How's that brother of yours?

195
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.119
You know. I always liked him.

196
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.772
- Good to see you again. Major.

197
00:15:47.772 --> 00:15:48.991
Now will you excuse me?

198
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:51.298
I'd like to-
- Nonsense.

199
00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:53.213
I'm not leaving you
here on your own.

200
00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:54.866
We've got so much to talk about.

201
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.601
They wanted me to be in
charge of the operation.

202
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:36.778
Times of action require men.

203
00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:40.477
not some fatheaded windbag.
full of his own importance.

204
00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:42.566
- Oh. yes. sir. real men.

205
00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.719
Not only were
all the gloves strewn.

206
00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:50.939
but the monkey had
to be destroyed.

207
00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:55.987
However. it was only
after I became suspicious

208
00:17:55.987 --> 00:17:57.859
that I discovered Lester here

209
00:17:57.859 --> 00:18:02.646
under his father's banana
tree. stark naked.

210
00:18:04.387 --> 00:18:05.997
Sir. we're
running low on champagne.

211
00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:08.261
May I have the keys for
the wine cellar. please?

212
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:10.567
Oh. yes. of
course. I'll just get the key.

213
00:18:12.613 --> 00:18:14.005
- Phoebe. how about that dance?

214
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:16.965
- Oh. bugger all.
- I'm so sorry.

215
00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.401
- Oh. sorry. Daddy.
- What luck.

216
00:18:18.401 --> 00:18:19.576
- Okay. old boy?
- That's okay. Lester.

217
00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:21.056
That's great. thank you. Lester.

218
00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:23.363
Excuse me.
- Sorry.

219
00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:35.375
I'll call you tomorrow.

220
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:38.378
- Make sure you call me.

221
00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:42.382
- Can I borrow your car?

222
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:31.170
- Lester?

223
00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:36.305
Fine. don't worry.
I've got the goods.

224
00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:37.350
On my way out.

225
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:22.803
- Addie.

226
00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:38.253
- Right. we've got
him trapped now.

227
00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:40.299
Send the rest of the team.

228
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:05.324
Get up there!

229
00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:38.052
- Ow!

230
00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:46.016
Kryssie?

231
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:52.806
I haven't got time for this.

232
00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:54.373
- Then give me the key.

233
00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:55.548
- You know Julian's got it.

234
00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:57.680
If you want it. come and get it.

235
00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.160
- Fine.

236
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:06.646
- Stop. just stop!

237
00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:17.700
- Stop or they'll shoot.

238
00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:21.138
- Thanks for the workout.

239
00:23:21.138 --> 00:23:22.139
- Drop dead.

240
00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:26.970
- Put the key on the floor
and your hands on your head.

241
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.972
- Is that what you want?

242
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.887
This?

243
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.593
- Damn it!

244
00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:37.476
- What happened?

245
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.347
- Slight deviation
from the original plan.

246
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:41.088
- Yeah. I'd say.

247
00:24:41.088 --> 00:24:42.872
What about him?

248
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:44.352
- He'll wake up with a headache.

249
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.963
- Good show. we've got it.

250
00:24:48.138 --> 00:24:49.139
- Of course.

251
00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:56.320
What do you think?

252
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.408
- Is that it?

253
00:25:00.324 --> 00:25:02.370
I wouldn't buy it.

254
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.980
- Well. I want
you to deliver it.

255
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.678
On my own?

256
00:25:05.678 --> 00:25:06.853
- All those years
of public school

257
00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:09.246
education. Lester. wasted.

258
00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:10.944
Yes. on your own.

259
00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:13.033
We're talking about a
million apiece here.

260
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:16.558
- I suppose.

261
00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:23.260
- Like I said. all
those wasted years.

262
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.087
- What?

263
00:25:30.616 --> 00:25:31.530
Right.

264
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.708
- Still don't understand why
they need me to do the drop.

265
00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:37.536
- Take a left at
the fifth floor.

266
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.494
third door on the left.
they'll meet you there.

267
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:42.410
The contact name is Francis.

268
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.977
- Francis.

269
00:25:43.977 --> 00:25:44.804
Got it.

270
00:25:46.283 --> 00:25:47.110
- Good luck.

271
00:26:12.048 --> 00:26:13.310
- Mr. Rossini.
- Yes?

272
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:17.619
- You're on your own.

273
00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:21.580
I thought your brother
was supposed to join us.

274
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.146
- He was?

275
00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:24.757
Yeah. he was.

276
00:26:26.628 --> 00:26:27.498
That case for me?

277
00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:30.632
- Yes.

278
00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:38.292
Don't you have something for me?

279
00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:40.686
- Oh. yeah.

280
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:43.558
I nearly forgot.

281
00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:52.436
- Please. please. please.

282
00:26:54.134 --> 00:26:54.961
No. no.

283
00:26:57.311 --> 00:26:58.617
Please. no.

284
00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:04.623
- I'll take that.

285
00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:21.291
Get the cases.

286
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.039
The car's out front.
I'll see you down there.

287
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:37.307
- You'll never get out of
this building alive. you know.

288
00:28:05.858 --> 00:28:06.989
- Nice tie.

289
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:20.699
- Get the car.

290
00:28:27.401 --> 00:28:28.968
- What the hell
were you thinking

291
00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:31.100
sending me in there
on my own like that?

292
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.407
- I haven't got time to
explain that to you. Lester.

293
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:42.721
Uh oh.

294
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:43.591
- What?

295
00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:02.741
- Hold on tight.

296
00:29:12.446 --> 00:29:13.752
- That'll hurt his pay book.

297
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.508
- Take that.

298
00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:32.509
- What for?

299
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:34.163
- Take a wild guess.

300
00:29:34.163 --> 00:29:35.164
- All right!

301
00:29:42.955 --> 00:29:43.956
- Look out!

302
00:29:50.527 --> 00:29:52.355
- That's good shooting.
give that back to me.

303
00:30:31.612 --> 00:30:32.439
Morning.

304
00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:33.614
- Morning.

305
00:30:33.614 --> 00:30:35.050
Better get to work inside.

306
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.225
The city engineers
have been on the phone.

307
00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:37.836
They're on their way down.

308
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:40.142
and they may want to
close down the dig.

309
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:42.492
- Can they do not?
- Oh. yes.

310
00:31:39.158 --> 00:31:41.116
- What way is this?

311
00:31:41.116 --> 00:31:44.380
It just keeps going
down and down and down.

312
00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:37.667
The body of the stone.

313
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.594
200.000
pounds. it's all yours.

314
00:33:51.594 --> 00:33:53.205
- What. all of it?

315
00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:55.033
All of it.

316
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:58.732
And a new passport. and details
of a new home in Valencia.

317
00:33:58.732 --> 00:34:00.299
- Valencia?

318
00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:01.952
What's going on. Add?

319
00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:07.349
- We're in over our heads
on this one. Lester.

320
00:34:07.349 --> 00:34:09.177
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

321
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:12.093
It's my fault. I'm sorry. but
you have to leave tonight.

322
00:34:12.093 --> 00:34:14.095
- I can't just leave.

323
00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:17.055
- We're dealing
with professionals.
professional killers!

324
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:19.144
They never intended to pay us.

325
00:34:19.144 --> 00:34:21.711
They wanted this trinket
and then us dead.

326
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:23.365
Now. you have to leave tonight.

327
00:34:24.888 --> 00:34:26.151
Don't call Phoebe.
don't call anyone.

328
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:27.413
Do you understand me?

329
00:34:27.413 --> 00:34:28.240
- Yeah.

330
00:34:29.197 --> 00:34:30.068
Yeah.

331
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.896
- I'm sorry.

332
00:34:34.028 --> 00:34:39.033
I really am.

333
00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.867
- It doesn't look so bad now.

334
00:34:46.867 --> 00:34:48.869
I almost like the place.

335
00:35:04.493 --> 00:35:05.581
Five holes.

336
00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:11.761
Looks like some sort of
key is needed to open it.

337
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:13.676
- Like the one we've lost.

338
00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:16.853
- Never mind.

339
00:35:21.031 --> 00:35:22.163
- Mr. Rossini.

340
00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:25.471
We have somebody here
that you might recognize.

341
00:35:30.693 --> 00:35:33.131
Of course you do. it's
your brother Lester.

342
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:37.874
We have a proposition
for you. Mr. Rossini.

343
00:35:37.874 --> 00:35:39.137
You'll carry out
another robbery.

344
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.529
and I'll be half this time.

345
00:35:42.009 --> 00:35:44.098
This is the item in question.

346
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:45.665
A jewel-encrusted golden eye.

347
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:47.710
currently in the care
of the British Museum.

348
00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:51.758
You'll find a building
layout. security arrangements.

349
00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:53.499
everything you need
for the successful

350
00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:56.371
planning of this operation
here on this desk.

351
00:35:57.894 --> 00:35:59.157
But I wouldn't spend too
long thinking about it

352
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:01.289
if I were you. Mr. Rossini.

353
00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:04.249
You see. we're working to
rather a tight deadline.

354
00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:09.079
My employer needs
both the jeweled eye

355
00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:12.213
and that key you so skillfully
acquired the other night

356
00:36:12.213 --> 00:36:13.954
by dawn tomorrow.

357
00:36:13.954 --> 00:36:16.826
Now. if you fail to do this.

358
00:36:19.525 --> 00:36:21.396
things could go badly
for Lester here.

359
00:36:23.877 --> 00:36:25.183
- Sorry. Addie.

360
00:36:27.881 --> 00:36:32.712
Very badly. indeed.

361
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.769
- Brother Sabec.

362
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:48.989
- It is time.

363
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:43.130
- You're looking well. Doctor.

364
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.394
I'm not here to harm you.
but I will if I have to.

365
00:37:52.966 --> 00:37:54.533
- I know you think you're
here to save us all. but-

366
00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:55.708
- If the amulet falls
into the wrong hands.

367
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:58.101
no one will be able to save us.

368
00:37:58.101 --> 00:37:59.886
- Please. don't go and make
things worse for yourself.

369
00:37:59.886 --> 00:38:02.715
- Things could get a lot
worse for both of us. Kryssie.

370
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.586
Ow.

371
00:38:47.586 --> 00:38:48.587
- Addie?

372
00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:02.356
- The news isn't good. brothers.

373
00:40:02.356 --> 00:40:03.923
What about the eye?

374
00:40:03.923 --> 00:40:05.359
- Someone has intercepted it.

375
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:07.230
but don't despair just yet.

376
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.537
Brother Sabec has tracked
it down and is watching.

377
00:40:09.537 --> 00:40:10.712
We
should just kill him.

378
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:12.453
- Patience. Brother.

379
00:40:12.453 --> 00:40:14.107
We don't know what his
motives are or what he intends

380
00:40:14.107 --> 00:40:17.066
to do with it.

381
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:28.687
The time to act is upon us.

382
00:40:57.759 --> 00:40:59.195
- Hello. Francis.

383
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:01.502
Guns down. down.

384
00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:05.550
- All of ya. put your guns down.

385
00:41:07.813 --> 00:41:10.337
- Where's my brother?

386
00:41:10.337 --> 00:41:11.338
Where is he?

387
00:41:12.687 --> 00:41:15.473
- Have you got something
for me. Rossini?

388
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.213
- My brother first.

389
00:41:43.718 --> 00:41:46.112
You all right. Lester?

390
00:41:46.112 --> 00:41:46.939
- Yeah.

391
00:42:13.966 --> 00:42:15.315
Call me.

392
00:42:18.623 --> 00:42:21.364
I don't think so.

393
00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:22.714
- What are you doing here?

394
00:42:22.714 --> 00:42:24.237
Retrieving
stolen goods.

395
00:42:30.417 --> 00:42:31.244
- No!

396
00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:33.594
Stop!

397
00:42:35.814 --> 00:42:37.816
Put the gun down. Dr. Segalman.

398
00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:41.733
You were never meant
to be involved in this.

399
00:42:43.169 --> 00:42:45.084
- But why?

400
00:42:45.084 --> 00:42:47.521
- The treasure. Kristina.
the treasure of Templars.

401
00:42:48.914 --> 00:42:51.786
With this key. I can
open the secret chamber.

402
00:42:51.786 --> 00:42:53.309
have it all!

403
00:43:03.189 --> 00:43:04.364
- Get in the car!

404
00:43:23.862 --> 00:43:25.037
- Where's she going?

405
00:43:30.695 --> 00:43:31.870
Get to the cars.

406
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.012
Lester. you okay?

407
00:44:27.012 --> 00:44:29.057
- I'm okay. are you okay?

408
00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:32.974
- I'm okay.

409
00:44:48.903 --> 00:44:50.296
Come on. hurry up!

410
00:44:50.296 --> 00:44:51.993
- I'm trying!
- Hurry up!

411
00:44:54.517 --> 00:44:55.867
- I got it!

412
00:45:15.582 --> 00:45:17.192
- If I don't get
to the Old Bailey.

413
00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:20.239
it'll be an unimaginable
catastrophe.

414
00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:21.370
Only I can stop it.

415
00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:23.982
- Are we going to
listen to this?

416
00:45:23.982 --> 00:45:25.723
This man is a mental patient.

417
00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:27.202
He stabbed me!

418
00:45:27.202 --> 00:45:28.726
Look!

419
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:29.901
- Yeah. well. I felt
like stabbing you

420
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:30.423
on more than one occasion.

421
00:45:31.511 --> 00:45:33.426
Now. listen. old man. all I want

422
00:45:33.426 --> 00:45:34.862
is the money that's owed to me.

423
00:45:34.862 --> 00:45:36.559
Maybe. as a bonus. get even

424
00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:38.736
with this Woodrow guy.
whatever his name is.

425
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:42.827
I don't
like the sound of that.

426
00:45:42.827 --> 00:45:45.830
- Why are you hanging
around with these people?

427
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.396
They will not help us.

428
00:45:47.396 --> 00:45:50.269
- Oi. I never asked
you to tag along.

429
00:45:50.269 --> 00:45:51.749
If we hadn't stopped
to collect you.

430
00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.969
you would've been shot.
or barbecued by now.

431
00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:56.492
- Time is running out.

432
00:45:56.492 --> 00:45:58.364
The demon will
soon have the key.

433
00:45:58.364 --> 00:46:00.496
and if he uses it
to open the door.

434
00:46:00.496 --> 00:46:03.935
he will release a curse
upon the whole of mankind.

435
00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:04.762
- What door?

436
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:08.548
- A doorway to hell.
constructed by Tyburn.

437
00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:12.465
- Tyburn?

438
00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:14.119
- Ulrich Tyburn.

439
00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:16.686
a Knight Templar of
the First Crusade.

440
00:46:18.471 --> 00:46:20.865
When the Christian forces
of the West took Jerusalem.

441
00:46:22.344 --> 00:46:24.520
a desperate search began
for religious relics.

442
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.046
Under the Temple of Solomon.

443
00:46:28.046 --> 00:46:30.613
we found treasures
beyond the imagination.

444
00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:36.315
Amongst these treasures was
a cup. the cup of Christ.

445
00:46:39.013 --> 00:46:40.058
the Holy Grail.

446
00:46:43.757 --> 00:46:46.281
But Tyburn had found
something else in the chamber.

447
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:51.330
an ancient key from a
world long forgotten.

448
00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:56.683
In a ceremony at the
Temple of Solomon.

449
00:46:57.858 --> 00:46:59.425
we drank from the Grail.

450
00:47:04.038 --> 00:47:05.213
and. in doing so.

451
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:11.829
received the gift

452
00:47:15.615 --> 00:47:16.616
of life eternal.

453
00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:24.580
But Tyburn's key was
cursed by an evil demon.

454
00:47:27.235 --> 00:47:31.631
It possessed his body
and poisoned his soul.

455
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:40.118
Tyburn must rid himself of all
traces of his own humanity.

456
00:47:40.118 --> 00:47:42.903
In 1381. I saved his
own granddaughter

457
00:47:42.903 --> 00:47:44.600
from a death at his hands.

458
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.733
Once again. he seeks his heir.

459
00:47:46.733 --> 00:47:49.431
the last of his
direct descendants.

460
00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:50.563
You. Kryssie.

461
00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:53.174
- What?

462
00:47:53.174 --> 00:47:53.871
- This is absurd.

463
00:47:55.611 --> 00:47:57.875
- There is a birthmark
on the back of your neck.

464
00:47:59.093 --> 00:48:00.573
Your mother had the same mark.

465
00:48:00.573 --> 00:48:02.792
as did her mother before her.

466
00:48:02.792 --> 00:48:04.316
- Right. enough!

467
00:48:04.316 --> 00:48:06.274
Woodrow and Francis
are at the Old Bailey.

468
00:48:07.667 --> 00:48:08.668
- Yes. I know.
- Well. that's where

469
00:48:08.668 --> 00:48:10.235
we're all headed.

470
00:48:10.235 --> 00:48:12.237
- I'm going to the
police. Addison.

471
00:48:12.237 --> 00:48:14.674
Do as you please.

472
00:48:21.115 --> 00:48:22.203
- No. let go!

473
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:37.088
- All my life. I've
dreamt of the treasure

474
00:48:37.088 --> 00:48:40.265
of the Templars.
and. now. here it is.

475
00:49:15.474 --> 00:49:17.215
My God. it's amazing.

476
00:49:24.744 --> 00:49:28.878
Where's the treasure.
where's the treasure?

477
00:49:28.878 --> 00:49:30.750
Where is the treasure?

478
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:54.513
- Cowardly mannered.

479
00:49:54.513 --> 00:49:57.081
I could smell your
fear as you slithered

480
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:09.093
- We have long awaited
your return. Master.

481
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:13.445
Your servants
await your command.

482
00:50:21.627 --> 00:50:22.454
- Stand.

483
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.720
There is much to do.

484
00:50:29.678 --> 00:50:30.940
They'll
be in there now.

485
00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.681
Quickly. there's
no time to lose!

486
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.032
- You all right in there?

487
00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:36.033
Let me out. you!

488
00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:38.731
- That's nice.

489
00:50:38.731 --> 00:50:39.993
Won't be long. honey.

490
00:50:39.993 --> 00:50:43.257
Just. yeah.
- How long?

491
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.873
- Stay up here and
keep your eyes open.

492
00:50:50.873 --> 00:50:52.005
- Fine by me.

493
00:51:01.275 --> 00:51:02.972
- Where is he going?

494
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.151
Where's he gone?

495
00:51:14.158 --> 00:51:16.421
- Where's the girl Kryssie?

496
00:51:17.813 --> 00:51:20.164
- She's behind you.
- Very funny.

497
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.123
You're so dead.

498
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:37.703
- How'd you get out of the boot?

499
00:51:37.703 --> 00:51:38.878
- Unlocked it.

500
00:51:46.146 --> 00:51:49.454
- No. Kryssie. get
out of here. now!

501
00:51:51.804 --> 00:51:53.980
There's no time. he can
sense your presence.

502
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.982
Quickly. get out.
get her out of here!

503
00:51:55.982 --> 00:51:57.984
- Let's go. now!

504
00:51:57.984 --> 00:51:59.768
- Keep her safe
at all costs. go!

505
00:52:07.428 --> 00:52:09.952
- My old friend Morgan.

506
00:52:12.607 --> 00:52:15.480
So you've been waiting
for me all these years.

507
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:17.438
Pathetic.

508
00:52:20.702 --> 00:52:25.707
You can't defeat me.
old man.

509
00:52:43.203 --> 00:52:44.987
We must
get her to safety.

510
00:52:44.987 --> 00:52:46.163
- It's locked!

511
00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:49.427
- Open the door!

512
00:52:53.996 --> 00:52:58.914
- Minion of darkness.
condemned souls of Newgate.

513
00:52:58.914 --> 00:53:02.266
servants of darkness bound
by your souls. hear me.

514
00:53:03.528 --> 00:53:04.355
Arise!

515
00:53:09.664 --> 00:53:11.579
- Open the door!

516
00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:13.320
- I've already tried.

517
00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:27.856
- Kill the men. bring
me the girl alive.

518
00:53:36.343 --> 00:53:37.562
- The servants of darkness?

519
00:53:37.562 --> 00:53:39.346
- That's my guess.

520
00:53:39.346 --> 00:53:40.608
Lester. open the door!

521
00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.269
- Don't worry.
Addie. I'm coming.

522
00:53:49.269 --> 00:53:51.358
- Lester. open the door.

523
00:53:53.273 --> 00:53:55.667
- Les. open the door!

524
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:57.016
God.

525
00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:05.459
- Tyburn. Tyburn. turn around.

526
00:54:05.459 --> 00:54:06.286
Face me.

527
00:54:11.944 --> 00:54:16.253
Lester. open the door!

528
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:18.167
- I'm trying. I really am!

529
00:54:52.419 --> 00:54:53.551
- Add. up there.

530
00:54:57.076 --> 00:54:58.120
- Looks good to me.

531
00:55:06.999 --> 00:55:07.869
Not bad.

532
00:55:20.578 --> 00:55:21.579
- No. Sabec!

533
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.896
- It's not gonna
hold them for long.

534
00:55:34.896 --> 00:55:36.071
Where are you going?

535
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:37.290
- This is the quickest way out.

536
00:55:50.956 --> 00:55:51.783
Now what?

537
00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:55.352
- Come on.

538
00:56:02.533 --> 00:56:05.318
- Don't worry.
Addie. I'm coming!

539
00:56:07.494 --> 00:56:08.756
What are you doing.
where's Addie?

540
00:56:08.756 --> 00:56:10.367
- They found another way out.

541
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:11.498
- Well. where's your friend?

542
00:56:11.498 --> 00:56:12.804
And who's this behind the door?

543
00:56:23.249 --> 00:56:26.383
- They're all locked.
what are we gonna do?

544
00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:27.645
- I'm thinking.

545
00:56:31.039 --> 00:56:32.345
- Come on!

546
00:56:32.345 --> 00:56:33.955
- Thinking.

547
00:56:33.955 --> 00:56:35.043
- Well. hurry!

548
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:38.046
- I'm thinking.

549
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:47.578
Where am I?

550
00:56:53.627 --> 00:56:54.802
Hold that door for a minute.

551
00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.238
- What?

552
00:56:56.238 --> 00:56:58.153
- Hold the door!
- What?

553
00:57:06.379 --> 00:57:08.076
- Good. that's good.

554
00:57:14.953 --> 00:57:17.956
- Good thinking.
Einstein. we're trapped.

555
00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.350
Tell me you have a plan
to get us out of here.

556
00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:22.830
- Not yet.

557
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.397
Well. hurry up!

558
00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:46.375
- Ah!

559
00:57:53.252 --> 00:57:54.732
I've got it!

560
00:57:57.735 --> 00:57:58.823
Tie this around your waist.

561
00:57:58.823 --> 00:58:00.389
- What are you doing?

562
00:58:00.389 --> 00:58:01.521
- I'm going to lower you
down to the pavement.

563
00:58:01.521 --> 00:58:02.696
Are you insane?

564
00:58:02.696 --> 00:58:05.003
- Have you got a better idea?

565
00:58:06.091 --> 00:58:07.484
Kryssie. we haven't got all day!

566
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:09.964
Okay. okay. okay.

567
00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:15.883
- Okay. careful. careful.

568
00:58:21.715 --> 00:58:23.151
- What about you?

569
00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:26.067
- I've got a plan for me.

570
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.290
- I'm not going without you.

571
00:58:32.334 --> 00:58:34.380
- Oh. yes. you are.

572
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.034
Go!

573
00:58:59.274 --> 00:59:00.928
Addie. help!

574
00:59:00.928 --> 00:59:01.799
No!

575
00:59:25.692 --> 00:59:28.216
- Leave him. he's mine!

576
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:40.489
No. no. no!

577
00:59:42.535 --> 00:59:44.276
Bring them to me!

578
00:59:44.276 --> 00:59:46.017
Bring them to me now!

579
00:59:50.412 --> 00:59:51.936
- What are you doing?

580
00:59:51.936 --> 00:59:53.241
We have to go back.
we have to help them.

581
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:55.896
- Go back. I'm not stopping you.

582
00:59:55.896 --> 00:59:57.158
- Fine. I will.

583
01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.426
You're sure you're not coming?

584
01:00:04.426 --> 01:00:08.343
- I'll help. but I think
we need to get armed first.

585
01:00:09.823 --> 01:00:12.826
- What did I do to
deserve you again?

586
01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.437
- Why. you pigheaded. son of a!

587
01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:20.442
You steal my relics.
you lock me in a trunk.

588
01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:22.314
throw me out the window!

589
01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:23.663
- Would you just calm down?

590
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.060
I'm gonna make a call.

591
01:00:42.073 --> 01:00:43.204
- Hello?

592
01:00:43.204 --> 01:00:44.379
- Lester.
- Where are you?

593
01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:45.685
- Yeah. we're on Suffix Street.

594
01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.733
- No problem. the cavalry
will be there in 10 minutes.

595
01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:51.560
Just hold on.

596
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.650
- Carrying it like that.
you'll shoot the wrong person.

597
01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:02.920
- Don't look!

598
01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:18.326
Hang on!

599
01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:37.432
No. get off!

600
01:01:38.912 --> 01:01:40.697
Get it off.
get it off. get it off!

601
01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.222
Get him off!

602
01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.140
Hold on tight.

603
01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.418
- We're trapped!

604
01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.642
Addie. help. help!

605
01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:13.039
Addie. help!

606
01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:42.721
Back. back!

607
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.949
- Now we're trapped.

608
01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.178
- There's no men after all.

609
01:06:07.224 --> 01:06:08.138
Come to me.

610
01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:12.620
- No!
- Kristina!

611
01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.535
- Addie!
- Kristina. no!

612
01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:25.155
- Oh. how touching.

613
01:06:25.155 --> 01:06:25.982
Kill him.

614
01:07:04.672 --> 01:07:05.630
- Are we done yet?

615
01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:21.776
I hate cashews.

616
01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:23.952
- Where is Kryssie?

617
01:07:23.952 --> 01:07:25.606
- They've taken her.

618
01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:27.695
- Then we must get her back.

619
01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:32.265
If Tyburn sacrifices Kristina.
it will complete his plan.

620
01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:34.441
Then the armies of evil
will consume the world.

621
01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:36.356
and all will be lost.

622
01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:37.531
- What are those things?

623
01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:39.055
This is holy water.

624
01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.665
I can use it to
injure the enemy.

625
01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:42.406
It burns them like
concentrated acid.

626
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.888
- Great. well. bottle
one for me. will you?

627
01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:48.629
- So what's the plan?

628
01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:51.197
- There's another way in.

629
01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:53.069
a secret passage
into the catacombs.

630
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.114
hidden beneath the
floor of this church.

631
01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.551
We sealed it in 1381.

632
01:07:59.336 --> 01:08:02.817
Sabec and his men reopened it
when Kristina found the key.

633
01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:04.558
- And once we're in?

634
01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:07.779
- We must send Tyburn through
the doorway into hell.

635
01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:09.520
- Oh. how. Morgan?

636
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.565
- Until Tyburn
completes his ceremony

637
01:08:11.565 --> 01:08:14.612
and makes his sacrifice.
the forces of evil

638
01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:18.485
will be unable to break free
from their world into our own.

639
01:08:18.485 --> 01:08:20.835
Tyburn is now one
of these creatures.

640
01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.272
a demon. a beast of Satan.

641
01:08:23.664 --> 01:08:25.536
If we can force Tyburn
through the door

642
01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:29.148
before he kills Kryssie. he
will be trapped like the others.

643
01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:30.106
unable to escape.

644
01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:32.195
- Right.

645
01:08:33.239 --> 01:08:34.110
Let's go.

646
01:08:47.906 --> 01:08:49.473
- He escaped us. sir.

647
01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:52.215
- Well. then. what
are you doing here?

648
01:08:54.521 --> 01:08:57.350
It would seem that I have
overestimated your usefulness.

649
01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:00.919
I have no further use for you.

650
01:09:03.922 --> 01:09:05.402
Please.
don't kill me!

651
01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:06.925
- Then give me your soul.

652
01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.149
I want it.

653
01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:21.853
- Welcome to Newgate.

654
01:09:28.294 --> 01:09:28.947
- Here it is. help me
with this. will you?

655
01:09:34.561 --> 01:09:36.259
Hold this for me.
will you. Lester?

656
01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:37.434
- What is it?

657
01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:39.175
- It's yours if I don't return.

658
01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.306
- While we're down
there. you keep

659
01:09:40.306 --> 01:09:41.177
watching the main entrance.

660
01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:42.743
- No problem.

661
01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:43.918
- Don't go being a
hero. do you hear?

662
01:09:43.918 --> 01:09:46.399
You know me. Addie.

663
01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.881
Stop
it. no. stop it!

664
01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:05.157
- It stinks.

665
01:10:28.615 --> 01:10:30.878
- Spooky churchyard. night.

666
01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:35.796
I just need to get a grip.

667
01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:36.623
Oh. man.

668
01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:33.506
Now I've got you.

669
01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:36.074
- Don't be afraid.

670
01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:41.645
With the taking of your life.
everything will be changed.

671
01:11:41.645 --> 01:11:44.735
- I'll see you in hell. first.

672
01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:45.997
- Oh. without doubt.

673
01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:18.334
With this flame of
life extinguished.

674
01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:22.947
let total darkness
consume this world.

675
01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:26.559
My sacred task complete.

676
01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:31.085
bring me your armies
of eternal damnation!

677
01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:56.693
You're too late. Morgan. you
should not have come here.

678
01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:06.006
- Kryssie!

679
01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:11.534
- Kill them.

680
01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:32.468
- Addie. help. help!

681
01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:31.265
- Morgan!

682
01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:43.887
How long did you leave me in
this temple to rot. Morgan?

683
01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:46.411
In all that time. I
thought of a million ways

684
01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:47.891
in which to make you suffer.

685
01:15:49.414 --> 01:15:52.548
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

686
01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:56.464
- A mistake I will
not be making twice.

687
01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:04.516
- Addie. Addie. up here!

688
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:45.731
- You have lost. Morgan.

689
01:16:47.385 --> 01:16:50.344
But I'm not going to
kill you quite just yet.

690
01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:55.349
Firstly. I want you to watch
as your friends die one by one.

691
01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:03.270
Watch them!

692
01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:22.463
- Holy water. anyone?

693
01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:38.610
- What are you
waiting for. stop him!

694
01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.353
- Addie. help!

695
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:46.618
- Thank you. my son.

696
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.889
- Idiot!

697
01:18:01.415 --> 01:18:02.895
- Lester. free Kryssie.

698
01:18:03.896 --> 01:18:05.681
No problem.

699
01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:27.485
- You have stood in my
way for the last time.

700
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:44.458
- To hell with you. Tyburn.

701
01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:57.254
Oh. crap.

702
01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.694
- I think you need
a refill.

703
01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.485
Your deaths will
be slow. indeed.

704
01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:37.076
- Turn around. Tyburn.

705
01:19:48.566 --> 01:19:50.568
Well. what are you waiting for?

706
01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:51.874
Come and get me.

707
01:19:56.008 --> 01:19:57.096
- As you wish.

708
01:20:05.496 --> 01:20:06.323
No!

709
01:20:07.237 --> 01:20:08.238
- Kryssie!

710
01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:09.674
No. no!

711
01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:17.290
- Take my hand.

712
01:20:49.714 --> 01:20:51.716
- Let go of her. Ulrich.

713
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.067
- Morgan!

714
01:21:14.043 --> 01:21:16.480
This place
is collapsing. let's go!

715
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.916
Lester. come on!

716
01:22:12.884 --> 01:22:15.887
- There's nothing
you could've done.

717
01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:18.324
- I know.

718
01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:30.902
- Leave him to
it. he'll be okay.

719
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:45.612
- So. now what?

720
01:22:48.354 --> 01:22:50.269
- Well. unless you
wanna get on a soapbox

721
01:22:50.269 --> 01:22:52.532
and explain all this.
I suggest we get going.

722
01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.970
- That's not what I meant.

723
01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:59.278
- What do you wanna do. tidy up?

724
01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:02.978
What?

725
01:23:04.805 --> 01:23:05.937
What?

726
01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.684
- Hey. Addie. there
is a treasure.

727
01:23:13.684 --> 01:23:15.599
According to Morgan's
book. it was buried

728
01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:19.559
500 years ago in a chamber
under Threadneedle Street.

729
01:23:20.952 --> 01:23:23.607
I wonder what's at
Threadneedle Street now.
