you've been acting strange lately

I'll be totally honest with you we are
going to do a second heist

138
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.840
the one in New York went so well we
decided to do a second one

139
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.970
and we're gonna ask for your help

140
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.630
so it was you that did New York

141
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.890
yes it was and it's gone really smoothly

142
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.850
no one can trace us. the money went through really well

143
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:57.690
because your the bank manager. we could
use you and we need some help from you

144
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.190
and it will never be traced back to you
I've got some codes

145
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:09.910
these codes I need you to put them in
five minutes before we arrive at the bank

146
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.150
once you put them in I need you to call me
then the heist team will come in

147
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.420
and hopefully be very successful in opening
the vault and getting the money

148
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.400
how can you assure me it won;t come back on me
I've got a family to look after

149
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.010
I've had this job for twelve years
I've got so much to lose

150
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.720
we've got a top hacker on the inside
he is going to wipe the records clean

151
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.520
and it will look like everything on the computer
was there from the day before

152
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.770
so there's no way it can be traced to you.
you'll be very safe

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.100
thanks for coming

171
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.060
just upfront here's a taster of the
money you'll be receiving

172
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.160
I need to be assured your a top hacker
and none of this gets back to us

173
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.450
I've been doing this since I was fourteen
your in safe hands

174
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.040
I've had banks pay me not to hack them

175
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.250
what I need you to do on the day he
time you tell me not a minute before

176
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.130
and not a minute after you need to be on the ball

177
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:35.180
I've got the exact date for you now
15th October 10AM in the morning

178
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.500
we've got the lady on the inside
who's going to use all the codes

179
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.690
so there is no way of tracing it back to you

180
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.900
the next question you're going to
ask me is what's your cut

181
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.280
your going to get twenty five
Percent of the heist

182
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.780
twenty five

183
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.500
sounds fair

184
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.870
it's good. we're going to split the money in Grease
in a safe location

185
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.040
so there is no complications
are you alright with that

186
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.880
Dylan - I'm in
Damien - Great to do a deal

187
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.220

193
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.090
Graham - have you sorted CCTV

194
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.800
I've been in this job for twenty years worked
from the bottom to the top

195
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800
I'm now head security of the bank

196
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.700
Frankie - I know where everything is
the CCTV. the power

197
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.560
the CCTV system. security alarms everything

198
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.690
I've got to make sure and get back to Rick and Paul
make sure everything is done correctly

199
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.410
they have got some big contacts
like Noah in Copenhagen

200
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.910
we've got to make sure this is done to a tee
really done properly

201
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.500
They have come to me for a reason
they trust me

202
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.330
it's all going to go to plan. I just need the
time and the date

203
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.130
before anything else can be put in to place

204
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.210
and all the payments will be
wire transferred via the bank

205
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:40.680
you can do it wire transfer. cash transfer
either way I just want my cut

206
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.480
because I am giving up my security life
for this bank job to help you lot

207
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.770
so I'm going to need my cut. because basically
I'm going to have to leave the country

208
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.290
I'm going to have to make a new life somewhere else

209
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.300

Hi there so right we are ready to go

294
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:15.350
we have a new set of codes they are 1966

295
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.810
We changed them as we have a security guard in the heist now

296
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.730
there was an issue so we had to change to codes

297
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:29.690
Damien - are you OK with that
Just assure me we have the route planned

298
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.280
the route to Greece is planned the flights are sorted out

299
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.500
everything is online and the hacker will wipe our names clean

300
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.920
from the flights so there is no trace on where we are traveling

301
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.960
Jane - Good
Damien - I'm really glad you are on board

302
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.960
and we should make a lot of money

303
00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.020
I told you Frankie will pull through
you had doubts about her

304
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.150

every detail Rick every god damn detail on this one

306
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.700
I still don't feel right about this one man I gotta say

307
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.370
this here how are we going to bypass this

308
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.540
how good are they security cameras

309
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:24.400
you under estimate me my friend so much

310
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.400
yeah I do what are we going to do here

311
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.880
we didn't need to bypass security in the New York heist
but we do in this one

312
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.430
Paul - Don't you think I got this covered
Rick - I'm not sure what about these areas

313
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:42.680
Rick - Do you really think we can trust her
Paul - it's not just about Frankie

314
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.520
it's not about the map you have
already spoken to Noah in Copenhagen

315
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:54.030
The hacker guy he is going to switch off the system

316
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:59.200
4:59pm Frankie is taking the power down

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.040
we are in it is looking like a power cut

318
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.920
she has got the whole plan down to a tee

319
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.630
we are coming in the exit at the back we are going in

320
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.710
the power is getting put back on
once we get inside

321
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.800
there is no CCTV the other CCTV is here. here and here

322
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.850
Paul - You heard what Noah said
Rick - OK OK

323
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:25.480
Paul - What are you thinking now
Rick - You're probably wondering why I'm negative

324
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.700
I've had a lot happen to me I've grown up a lot

325
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.650
what happened to the Rick that took God damn risks

326
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.200
maybe he grew up a bit and doesn't
want to go back to the penitentiary

327
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.240
I'm blaming Amanda then on this one

328
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.490
Yeah she has a lot to do with it
but don't bring her into this

329
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.000
I'm trying to focus

330
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.830
Paul - Well focus then
Rick - Right I'm going to take your word for it

331
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.920
Rick - lets just do this
Paul - trust me it's going to work

332
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.170
we have got every base covered
we got Jane down on this corner

333
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.300
We are coming in that back exit
the CCTV is getting wiped out

334
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.510
there is going to be no CCTV there is going to be a time jump

335
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.730
which will be 4:59pm that's when we go in

336
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.690
that's when Frankie takes the power down
she will take the power down

337
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.250
once we are in she puts the power on
it looks like a power cut

338
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.070
once we are in we do it
you have heard the plans from Noah

339
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.330
this is the map we need to get this over to Damien and the heist team

340
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.580
Rick - OK let's do it
Paul - Yeah

341
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.960
sorry for the negativity I gotta be careful man

342
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.750
Paul - get back to that focus
Rick - I will I'm sorry I will

343
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.090

344
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.890
Paul - Let's do it
Rick - OK let's get this over to the guys

345
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.260

348
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.950
it's a bit up and down at the moment

349
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.080
to be honest I'm going to quit

350
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.450
I've got a really good investment lined up

351
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.600
[LAUGHS]

352
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.500

Chloe - I fancy that
Paul - The weather is warm

356
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.780
I think you should join me in Copenhagen for a bit

357
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.360
Chloe - That's a thought
Paul - you wanna know why

358
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.280
Chloe - why
Paul - you will be more financial stable

359
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.540
I'm not going to tell you why it's a surprise

360
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.170
Chloe - a surprise
Paul - I know you like surprises

Chloe - of course
Paul - you will be more financially stable

362
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.090
I hope so it's something to think about

363
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.470
Paul - let's go for this food
Chloe - come on then

364
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.810

368
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.570

yes you have how the hell did you find me

373
00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.100
you left me with no choice but to go
through the Dallas heist team

374
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.350
the way you left me did you forget about that

375
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:57.190
you stole $100.000 off me

376
00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.780
I stole. you left me broke
working in diners

377
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.160
I could barely pay my rent because of you

378
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.200
cause of me. you took everything from me

379
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.450
Rick - why are you even here Amanda
Amanda - you don't even understand

380
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:14.540
before I met you I was going college
I was gonna have a successful career

381
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.290
but you ruined it for me
you taught me this high life

382
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:26.260
I did and you obviously want in on the next heist

383
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.140
Amanda - of course I do
Rick - the Dallas guys told you

384
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.220
what is it Amanda that you want from me

385
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.140
you think I'm stupid don't you

386
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.860

392
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.170
ruined my career and now
you're telling me you got no money

393
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.760
you never wanted me to start with
you wanted my money

394
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.720
that's all you wanted

395
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.600
Amanda - oh really
Rick - so it's funny

396
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.180
Amanda - it is funny
Rick - gold digger

397
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.770
gold digger
I was going college before all of this

398
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:28.610

399
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:33.030

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.210
Amanda - no I'm not
Rick - you gonna leave me high and dry again

402
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.340
you left me high and dry now it's your turn

403
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:49.010
do you realize how hard it was for me to get over you
you broke my heart

404
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.390
you broke my bank account how about that

405
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.220
it is all about money with you

406
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.450
Amanda - yeah
Rick - you belong in the diner

407
00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.100
Amanda - how dare you
Rick - I found you in the gutter

408
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.400
right and I can put you back in the gutter

409
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.190
you think you can come waltzing back in to my life
oh just give me $300.000

410
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.350
I'll go to the Dallas team and tell them where you are right now

411
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:15.660
I know everything and I will say it and
they will come after you

412
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.000
Amanda - I want my money
Rick - we gonna resort to blackmail

413
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.920
Amanda - blackmailing me
Rick - what did I ever see in you

414
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.170
what did I see in you clearly

415
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:29.840
so what is it that you really want me to say

416
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.890
how dare you call me a gold digger

417
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.430
you're forgetting that I actually loved you

418
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.430
do you forget about that

419
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.400
it was not about money or shopping or
the materialistic stuff

420
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.110
or any of that I actually loved you

421
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.780
you took me from here to all the way down here

422
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.530
I'm not happy about that of course not

423
00:31:53.530 --> 00:32:01.460
I guess it must have been like giving you
a winning lotto ticket and taking it back

424
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:07.000
what do you think it is like giving someone
hungry food then taking it away

425
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.470
no I'm not going back to my old life
you taught me this life I want back in

426
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.470
Amanda - simple as that
Rick - OK fine

427
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.430
OK I'm going to give you $100.000

428
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.770
I have not got $300.000 if I had I would give you it

429
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.810
I'm such a generous guy I've given you so much

430
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.690
I'm such a lovely guy like that

431
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:33.610
I'm going to get Noah to wire it to
your account in Florida account

440
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:09.820
Amanda - don't forget my money
Rick - I won't forget how can I

441
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.440
[LAUGHS]

442
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:28.000
[MUSIC]

443
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.380
this heist is going to be done when
Frankie shuts the vault

444
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:41.640
we are doing this one under my watch

445
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.600
we are going to get away
none of us will get caught

446
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.770
not one of us you are all going to the
countries you want to go to

447
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:54.570
you. you're coming to Copenhagen with me
I said no guns on the job

448
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.240
Damien - no guns
Rick - we should have a gun

449
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.580
on the safe side we should have a gun

450
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.620
Paul - you think
Rick - I will feel better with a gun

451
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.670
Rick - yeah
Paul - on your call

452
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.380
so we got the cars lined up here

453
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.420
already to go we get this done
we get out

454
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.180
and the hacker will seal that so
once we are out no one can follow us

455
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:23.430
Paul - you got your guy on the CCTV
Rick - yeah I got him yeah

456
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:29.400
it is red hot but it is going to work fine don't worry

457
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.400
I'm not confident

458
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.400
you're not confident why

459
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.700
Chloe - I just got a bad feeling
Rick - we got everything covered

460
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:45.830
I got hacker here and this area
we got totally covered right

461
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:53.840
Damien - if I get the hacker to put a decoy there

462
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.920
so nobody will focus where we are
leaving from will that help you

463
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.600
are you happy if we move Jane from
that corner to West Broadway

464
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.970
yeah I think Jane will be great yeah

465
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.850
are you sure that is going to be OK with you Jane

466
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.850
yeah all good everything is good with me
everything is good to go

467
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.700
you know what to do if it gets on top
and the numbers to all and codes

468
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.700
I do yeah all sorted

469
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.110
OK as long as you're comfortable with that

470
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:24.120
you do not seem sure what is it be honest

471
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.870
you're the one with the gun you
should be the most confident here

472
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:33.630
well you done the move so not much more
I can do but I'm still not confident

473
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.090
be confident and be confident in every job I have ever done

474
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.090
Chloe - I'm taking the gun
Paul - like I said that's on your call

475
00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:46.060
every single job I have ever done every
single heist look at my track record

476
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.390
not one of my heist team have ever been caught

477
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:54.690
I got a woman down in Brazil she don't even
need plastic surgery she is sailing plain high

478
00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.400
right Jane you wanna come have a look

479
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.200
we are moving you down to West Broadway down the bottom corner

480
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.580
you are he number one look out
you know the codes

481
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.200
you know the numbers you know how
to let everyone know what's going on

482
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:16.250
we got Frankie she is going to tell us
how she will get us in to the vault

483
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:21.880
right I will turn these off you have got 60 seconds to get in

484
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.180
before I put the lights back on

485
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.890
I will switch them off again so it looks like a power cut

486
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:31.140
and you got 60 seconds to get back out before you get caught

487
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.440
Frankie - got it
Team - got it

488
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.690
we can do it we can do it in 60

489
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.690
in out

490
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:44.780
we are not talking about 60 seconds to
get in get the stuff and out

491
00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.620
we got 60 seconds to get in once we are in that vault

492
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.750
we can spend 3 hours in that God damn vault

493
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:55.540
Frankie gives us the time she will put it back off again

494
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.210
we got 60 seconds to get back out again

495
00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.300
so don't be panicking that we got 60 seconds to get in and out

496
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.470
Paul - Frankie you happy with that

look at the jobs you said
the New York job you know

663
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.600
then look at the job they did down in Dallas

664
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.870
another $5.000.000 job and they got the
gems on the side
