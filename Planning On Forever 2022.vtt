Danielle is going to love

She is going to love my designs.

10
00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:53.009
I sought simplicity in both
efficiency and aesthetic

11
00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:55.011
with neutral centerpieces.

12
00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:58.406
clean white table settings and
an agreeable surf and turf menu.

13
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.668
It's by the book...

14
00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.496
But the Essential Events way.

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.412
The client will love these.

16
00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:07.023
I am so happy to hear you
say that.

17
00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:09.808
because I had some
extra time and...

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.160
I wanted to present the client

19
00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:15.379
with something a little
more personal.

20
00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:17.033
They mentioned a love of nature.

21
00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:19.905
so I adjusted the entryway
to reflect that.

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.473
And. I also looked
into napkin origami

23
00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:24.997
to spice up the table settings
a little.

24
00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.870
It is a paper company.
after all.

25
00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:31.003
Emma. these are incredible.

26
00:01:31.178 --> 00:01:33.919
but I'm afraid the client
won't love this.

27
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.921
It's just the reality
of corporate events.

28
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.272
Pragmatism over personal touch.

29
00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:39.925
I understand.

30
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.884
I figured it was worth a shot.

31
00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:44.321
And hey. now I know how to turn
a napkin into a duck

32
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:45.627
in under five minutes.

33
00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:48.543
Leave it to you to find
the silver lining.

34
00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:50.110
Which reminds me.

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:52.460

in Seattle

36
00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:55.550

to find a candidate to lead it.

37
00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:57.900
I immediately thought of you.

38
00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:00.511
Oh. wow. thank you. Danielle.

39
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.600
that sounds like
a huge opportunity.

40
00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:06.082
Well it would be but it would
mean you relocating to Seattle.

41
00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:08.302
You would oversee our entire
client schedule

42
00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:10.913
and you'd be the queen
of corporate events there.

43
00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.262
That's quite a title.

44
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:15.222
Oh.

45
00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.224
Oh. it's your sister's
engagement party tonight. right?

Technically it starts
in 20 minutes.

47
00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:21.184
But. if I leave here
in three minutes

48
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:23.099
I can still get there
with two minutes to spare.

49
00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:25.275
You know. why don't we do
something crazy

50
00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.930
and let you off early so you can
have two minutes to spare

51
00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:29.845
and three minutes to relax?

52
00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.281
-Relax?
-Mm-hm.

53
00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:32.978
That's not something
I do often.

54
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.895

Well. unfortunately
not a whole lot of people

75
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.204
want to plan a wedding
in six weeks.

76
00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:27.598

Are you sure you can't wait
just a little longer?

80
00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:35.519
Our five year anniversary
is the perfect date

81
00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:38.000

wedding details at me...

Well. I. you're my sister.
and I love you. I do.

103
00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:35.884
But I'm really worried
that you're focusing so much

104
00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:37.451
on everyone else's dreams

105
00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.061
that you're forgetting
about your own.

106
00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.629
Now she really sounds like me.

107
00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:44.371
Mom. You did not have to bake
anything for today.

108
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:46.416
But these are your
milestone macaroons.

109
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.027
I made them for
every graduation.

110
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:50.638
Your first dance.

111
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:52.553
and when you passed
your driver's test.

112
00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:55.556
Uh. you also made them
when I failed my driver's test.

113
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.037
Yes. And when you went
to try again. you passed.

114
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:00.169
And you're welcome.

115
00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.912

Ok. why is it always about
my dating life?

123
00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:21.538
Mom. you know
I've been telling you

124
00:05:21.712 --> 00:05:23.279
to start putting yourself
out there again.

125
00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:24.846
And I will.

126
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.936
I will. um. in my own time.

127
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.941
But for now. I wanna take
good care of my daughters.

128

Oh. I think it's time
for speeches.

129

On that note.

130
00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:38.599
Mom. Emma. will you please
gather everyone

131
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:39.861
for the speeches?

132
00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:41.123

A year.

Not that I've been counting.

143
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.980
I see you're still biking.

144
00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:14.591
Kind of have to when you own
a bike shop.

145
00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:15.940
Right.

Good.

148
00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:20.554
Great. actually.

149
00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:22.512
We just got a new shipment
in of tandem bikes.

150

another try.

152
00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:29.998
I have to say. I haven't crashed
since then.

153

Until now. when you almost
ran into me?

154
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.002
I was only going so fast
because...

155
00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:36.178
You were late? Hm.

156
00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:37.875
Reminds me of our first date.

157
00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.181
And only date.

158

159
00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:44.012
Don't move.

160
00:06:44.186 --> 00:06:46.014
If you missed me this much.
a hug would have sufficed.

161
00:06:46.188 --> 00:06:48.190
Oh. dream on.
Just hide me.

162
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.670
I got an idea.

Guess what time it is?

164
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:54.892
It's ice cream time!

Mel. it's so good to see you.

180
00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:34.932
Hi! Liam.

181
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:36.586
-You look lovely.
-Thank you.

182
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.632
Wait. how do you know my mom?

183
00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:41.417
Liam came over for dinner with
Brett and Miranda a while ago.

184
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:44.202
They wanted me to get to know
their best man.

185
00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:46.030
You're the best man?

186
00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:47.989
Best friend. best man.
Usually that's how it works.

187
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:50.034
That's not a problem. is it?

188
00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:52.384
No. not at all.

189
00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:54.125
...and Maid of Honor...

190
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:55.562
Speaking of. Emma. honey.
Maid of honor's up next.

191
00:07:55.736 --> 00:07:56.911
Thanks.

192
00:07:57.085 --> 00:07:58.913
And you're Maid of Honor?

193
00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:02.482
Sister. Maid of Honor.
tends to work out that way too.

194
00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:08.096
Guess that's my cue.

195
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:15.451
I am calm and confident.

196
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.062
I am brave and balanced.

197
00:08:18.236 --> 00:08:19.847
They're gonna love my speech.

198
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.501
They are gonna love my speech.

199
00:08:25.983 --> 00:08:27.158
Speech.

200
00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:34.339
Speeches are good.
speeches are fun.

201
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:42.957
Uh. we. I mean you. Brett
and Miranda. like speeches.

202
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.306
May I?

203
00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:48.310
I think what Emma's trying
to say is that today

204
00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:50.573
is a sentimental day
for everyone.

205
00:08:50.747 --> 00:08:52.619
Even the cake is in tears.

206
00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:57.145
And that happiness
right there.

207
00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.800
that's all I've ever wanted
for my sister.

208
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:01.018
Thank you.

209
00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:10.332
Your love for puns certainly
hasn't changed.

210
00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:14.031
And you still do those
affirmations. I see.

211
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.990
I don't know what
you're talking about.

212
00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:18.514
I think I remember you doing
them right as I dropped you off.

213
00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:23.867
Something like. you can be
single and still be happy.

214
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:26.827
Well. both of those things
are true.

215
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.090
That was quite
the joint speech.

216
00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:30.918
Yeah.

217
00:09:31.092 --> 00:09:34.051
Clearly you guys can work
well together. In tandem.

218
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:35.923
Too soon for failed
blind date jokes?

219
00:09:36.097 --> 00:09:37.446
It's been a year.

220
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.447
You guys have moved
past it. right?

221
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:40.318
Don't worry about me.

222
00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:42.494
I forgave Emma's bike riding
skills a long time ago.

223
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.105
Very funny.

224
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.933
As long as I'm not the girl
waiting for Liam

225
00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.849
to arrive on time.
I'm good.

226
00:09:49.023 --> 00:09:50.241
Found ya!

227
00:09:51.068 --> 00:09:53.680
And Liam. don't think
I forgot about you.

228
00:09:56.378 --> 00:09:58.162
-Yay!
-Thank you.

229
00:09:58.336 --> 00:09:59.511
Be right back!

230
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:00.338
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

231
00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:02.123
Cheers.

232
00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:07.128
What shade of pink?

233
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.912
Definitely the second.

234
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:11.393
It's understated and elegant.
just like you.

235
00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:12.916
You have the best instincts.

236
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.396
Speaking of which.

237
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.224
I need your help
with something tomorrow.

238
00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:17.878
Pick out the wedding dress?

239
00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.531
Don't worry. I already have
some thoughts.

240
00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:22.230
Mom sent her ideas too.

241
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:24.101
Let me guess. poofy sleeves?

242
00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:28.062
If it reminded her of
her wedding. she sent it.

243
00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:30.238
On that note. I should probably
get back to work.

244
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:32.066
It is crazy right now.

245
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.024
Everything ok?

246
00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:35.678
Yeah. Brett and I are in charge
of overseeing the restructuring

247
00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:37.898
for one of our biggest clients
out West.

248
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:40.074
Miranda. that's huge.

249
00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:41.510
Out on your own
for less than a year

250
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:43.164
and look how far you guys
have come.

251
00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:45.601
Running your own consulting
company is great

252
00:10:45.775 --> 00:10:48.604
but this new job has been
a lesson in patience.

253
00:10:48.778 --> 00:10:50.388
Is there anything I can do
to help?

254
00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:52.042
Find my wedding dress tomorrow.

255
00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.435
I can't wait.

256
00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:56.090
-Love you.
-Love you too.

257
00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:01.704
Queen of corporate events.

258
00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:08.058
♪

259
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:18.460
♪

260
00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:20.941
You find anything yet?

261
00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:24.509
She hasn't. but I sure have.

262
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.991
This reminds me. I do want
to go look at the lace options.

263
00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:30.559
Just keep it to a minimum. Mom.

264
00:11:32.082 --> 00:11:34.041
Kind of feel like the dress
will find me.

265
00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:35.607
I wish I could wear
tennis shoes.

266
00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:37.174
Of course you do.

267
00:11:37.348 --> 00:11:39.307
Ok. ok. I should probably
start searching

268
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.526
a little more seriously.

269
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.009
So. I got offered a promotion
at work.

270
00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:49.970
What? Way to bury the lead.
Why are we not celebrating?

271
00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.580
Because I haven't taken it yet

272
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:54.235
and I don't want to tell Mom
until I do.

273
00:11:54.409 --> 00:11:56.150
I'd have to move to Seattle.

274
00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:57.891
Seattle?

275
00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:59.849
Wow. you better believe
that I will be visiting.

276
00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:02.156
You know. I watch that show with
the fish throwing guys on TV.

277
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.331
it's crazy.

278
00:12:03.505 --> 00:12:04.985
You know what's crazy?

279
00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.421
The fact that we are wedding
dress shopping

280
00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:08.597
and you haven't tried on
a single one.

281
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:13.341
Meet me in the dressing room.

282
00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:21.001
Mom. her wedding is gonna
be beautiful.

283
00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:39.541
It's beautiful.

284
00:12:40.107 --> 00:12:43.066
Wait. the finishing touch.

285
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.156
The one I wore when I married
your dad.

286
00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:51.509
I wish he was here to see this.

287
00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:53.729
He's here in spirit.

288
00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:00.649
We understand.

289
00:13:00.823 --> 00:13:02.042
We'll be there as soon
as possible.

290
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.871
What's going on. Brett?
Is everything ok?

291
00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:06.829
Not exactly.

292
00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:09.832
Our west coast guys just called.
the onsite consultant quit.

293
00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:11.834
What? He just up and left?

294
00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:13.923
Yeah.

295
00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:15.098
Apparently the reconstructing
was too much for him to handle.

296
00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:16.491
We have to get over there now.

297
00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:18.145
we cannot afford to lose
this deal.

298
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.537
I know. but the job is slated
to take weeks.

299
00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:22.323
Weeks. how many weeks?

300
00:13:22.497 --> 00:13:24.412
Well. technically
we had until...

301
00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:25.587
Three days before the wedding.

302
00:13:25.761 --> 00:13:27.415
Three days?!

303
00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:29.199
That's why we sent him
in our place to begin with.

304
00:13:29.373 --> 00:13:30.766
We knew we'd have to handle
wedding details here

305
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.289
so we planned to do everything
virtually.

306
00:13:32.463 --> 00:13:34.378
Well. can't you send
someone else?

307
00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:35.945
No. Not now.

308
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:39.296
Our reputations are
on the line.

309
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.994
You know. it's. it's fine.

310
00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:42.996
I'll just hire a wedding
planner.

311
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.954
Emma. you said you could
refer someone?

312
00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:47.087
There's no time for that.

313
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:48.610
Unless...

314
00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:52.570
No. No way!

315
00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:54.224
No. it'll be perfect.

316
00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:55.443
You won't even have to be
a wedding planner.

317
00:13:55.617 --> 00:13:57.619
more like a wedding...

318
00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:01.449
...stand-in.

319
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:02.842
I already have all
the meetings set up

320
00:14:03.016 --> 00:14:04.234
with the florist and the band.

321
00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:06.106
you just have to stand in
for me.

322
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.456
A wedding stand-in?

323
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.980
Miranda. corporate events
are very different...

324
00:14:11.154 --> 00:14:13.287
Listen. I know you think
you're not cut out for this.

325
00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.855
but I believe in you.

326
00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:17.508
Please. Emma.

327
00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:19.859
I promise it'll be fun
and if you say yes.

328
00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:23.036
I'll never make you wear
a cousin Becky sash again.

329
00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.129
Ok. I'll do it.

330
00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:31.000
Yes. you are the best sister.

331
00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:34.395
But. I am not a wedding planner.
so fair warning...

332
00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:35.831
No. wedding stand -in.
Very different.

333
00:14:36.005 --> 00:14:37.964
But. who's standing in for me?

334
00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:40.140
Hm. Good question.

335
00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:41.315
Cousin Al?

336
00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:43.230
Please. no.

337
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:44.884
Too much time with that cologne
might just be the death of me.

338
00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:48.017
No. I got someone really
different in mind.

339
00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:50.454
You want me to be a what?

340
00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:52.108
A wedding stand-in.

341
00:14:52.282 --> 00:14:54.502
-Is that a thing?
-It is now.

342
00:14:54.676 --> 00:14:56.156
But what does it entail?

343
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.722
That's what I'm still trying
to figure out.

344
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.463
It's simple. I already have
all the meetings

345
00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:01.161
set up with the vendors.

346
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.945
Meetings we were going
to attend. but now can't.

347
00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:04.164
So you guys will go.

348
00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:06.122
-As you?
-For us.

349
00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:08.516
You aren't pretending to be us.
you're representing us.

350
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.561
And making all the decisions.

351
00:15:10.735 --> 00:15:12.868
But how do we know
what decisions to make?

352
00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:16.350
You both know us so well.
we trust you to choose for us.

353
00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:18.613
-Miranda. are you sure?
-Absolutely.

354
00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:21.572
That way we can focus all our
attention on the restructuring.

355
00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.879
With two of us there.
things will go much faster.

356
00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.926
Plus. Brett and I
talked about it

357
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.666
and we thought
it would be fun

358
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.539
to have everything about
the wedding be a surprise.

359
00:15:31.713 --> 00:15:33.889
You don't even want me to run
our decisions by you?

360
00:15:34.063 --> 00:15:35.108
Nope.

361
00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:36.936
Because at the end of the day.

362
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.416
you could throw a million
wedding details at us but...

363
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.549
It's the date
that matters.

364
00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:43.377
See. you guys get it.

365
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:46.206
And I promise we will be back
in time for the wedding.

366
00:15:47.424 --> 00:15:49.078
Well. that's a relief.

367
00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:53.909
We can't be standing in
for you on the altar.

368
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:55.867
You guys think
you're up for this?

369
00:15:56.042 --> 00:15:57.217
I'm in.

370
00:15:58.348 --> 00:16:01.917
I promise it will be the wedding
of your dreams.

371
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:03.223
A stand-in?

372
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:09.055
Yeah. Apparently I have flowers
to arrange and cakes to taste.

373
00:16:09.229 --> 00:16:10.708
How're we doing today?

374
00:16:10.882 --> 00:16:12.406
Three more requests
for electronic shifts.

375
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.973
What's next? Bikes that
ride themselves?

376
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.539
Let's hope not.

377
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:17.454
If I fix a few more vintage ones

378
00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:19.587
maybe people will want to go
back to the good ol' days.

379
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:21.545
You know. when we shifted
our own gears.

380
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.895
Got time for one more?

381
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.856
Ed? For you? Always.

382
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.991
And. is that. is that
a Riley Ranger?

383
00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:33.949
You bet it is.

384
00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:35.951
They don't make these anymore.

385
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.431
If I refurbish this you could
sell it for a pretty penny.

386
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:39.172
You think so?

387
00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:41.435
In the vintage bike world.
this is as good as gold.

388
00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:43.611
I had a feeling it was
a lucky bike.

389
00:16:43.785 --> 00:16:45.221
What do I owe ya?

390
00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:47.136
Come on. Ed. you know
I can't charge ya.

391
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.225
I figured you might say that
so I brought the one payment

392
00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:51.271
I knew you would accept.

393
00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:53.316
Fresh out of the oven.

394
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.275
You're too good to me.

395
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.106
I'll have her ready
in the next few weeks.

396
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.759
Take your time.

397
00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:03.935
If you need me. you know
where you can find me.

398
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.154
Thanks. Ed.

399
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.114
Don't even think about it.

400
00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:11.813
No. I said flip-flops.

401
00:17:11.987 --> 00:17:13.293
Like the shoe.

402
00:17:13.467 --> 00:17:15.295
It's a wedding favor.

403
00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:17.949
because heels can't be worn
forever. sir...

404
00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:19.473
Hi. sorry I'm late.

405
00:17:19.647 --> 00:17:21.388
Planning the whole wedding now.
Kind of.

406
00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:25.000
Actually. standing in.
Long story. never mind.

407
00:17:25.174 --> 00:17:28.569
Well. if you can monogram a wine
glass you can monogram a shoe.

408
00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:32.529
Hm. Breathe.

409
00:17:34.314 --> 00:17:36.011
That felt good.

410
00:17:36.185 --> 00:17:37.839
I know. So you're planning
your sister's wedding now?

411
00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:39.928
Yes. and no.
It's complicated.

412
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:42.800
But I promise it will
not affect work.

413
00:17:42.974 --> 00:17:45.499
No. this is perfect.

414
00:17:45.673 --> 00:17:47.849
In fact. I think this is exactly
what you need.

415
00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:49.285
It is?

416
00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:50.895
Mmhm. Seattle's
a big decision.

417
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.507
So. take some time.

418
00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:55.248
Focus on the wedding
and when it's over.

419
00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:56.553
we will talk promotion.

420
00:17:56.727 --> 00:17:58.512
Then you'll know
how you feel.

421
00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:00.557
Thank you. Danielle.

422
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:03.952
I can't tell you how refreshing
it is to hear you say that.

423
00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:05.867
Oh. my gosh. I just remembered.

424
00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:08.391
Drinks. What do people drink
at weddings?

425
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:11.002
Uh. I think the same things
they drink at other parties.

426
00:18:11.177 --> 00:18:12.178
-Right.
-Yeah.

427
00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:13.701
Right.

428
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:14.832
You're gonna be great.
You got this.

429
00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:16.182
-I got this.
-Yeah.

430
00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:19.402
♪

431
00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:21.970
Liam Barlow.
reporting for duty.

432
00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:23.450
Congratulations.

433
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:26.409
-You are one minute early.
-Yes!

434
00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:29.369
So. are you ok that I'm here?

435
00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:32.154
I'm fine. Are you ok
that I'm here?

436
00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:33.851
For sure.

437
00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:35.375
Great.

438
00:18:38.247 --> 00:18:39.901
So. do you know anything
about flowers?

439
00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:42.599
Nothing at all.
But I'm a fast learner.

440
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:45.211
Well. at least that counts
for something.

441
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:48.388
-Hi. guys.
-Hey.

442
00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.216
I'm Natalie. welcome.

443
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.392
and congratulations
on your engagement.

444
00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:55.569
What? Oh. no.
we're not engaged.

445
00:18:55.743 --> 00:18:57.875
Oh. I thought this was
a wedding appointment.

446
00:18:58.049 --> 00:18:59.703
It is.

447
00:18:59.877 --> 00:19:02.141
-But not our wedding.
-We're sort of standing in.

448
00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:03.794
For the bride and groom.

449
00:19:03.968 --> 00:19:05.100
They're getting married.
not us.

450
00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:06.841
Right. What he said.

451
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:10.845
Well. the bride and groom
must really trust you.

452
00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:12.586
Shall we get started?

453
00:19:21.072 --> 00:19:23.466
These roses are lovely.

454
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.294
-It's the flower of love. right?
-Mm-hm.

455
00:19:25.468 --> 00:19:27.209
Too predictable.

456
00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:29.124
Peonies weren't?

457
00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:31.953
Classic and predictable
are two very different things.

458
00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:35.130
All right. well what
about sunflowers?

459
00:19:35.304 --> 00:19:37.132
Sunflowers could work.

460
00:19:39.439 --> 00:19:44.922
Hm. Now. these I like.

461
00:19:45.096 --> 00:19:49.100
You've got quite the eye. I love
hydrangeas for weddings.

462
00:19:49.275 --> 00:19:51.277
It's a pass for me.

463
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:55.237
Hydrangeas and air conditioning
are not friends.

464
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:58.197
At this rate we're gonna be
here all night.

465
00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:01.896
These.

466
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.855
They're different.
Bold. yet down to earth.

467
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:06.074
Like Miranda.

468
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:08.946
And a symbol of new beginnings.

469
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.472
So? Do we have a flower?

470
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:15.214
We have a flower.

471
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.173
We have a flower.

472
00:20:19.174 --> 00:20:21.742
I think Miranda's really gonna
love these.

473
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:24.310
Wait. Liam!

474
00:20:26.703 --> 00:20:31.621
If you ever need anything for
the wedding or something else.

475
00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:34.015
don't hesitate to call.

476
00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:36.496
I do still have some burning
questions about ranunculus's.

477
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.672
so I'll definitely call you.

478
00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:44.286
Do you even know
what a ranunculus is?

479
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.375
Round and red.

480
00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:51.989
-Oh. it's Miranda.
-Oh.

481
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:53.687
-Hey!
-Hey.

482
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.515
How's my favorite duo?
You pick us out a flower?

483
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:59.040
Yep. somehow we both agreed
the second we saw it.

484
00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:01.564
See. I told you working together
wouldn't be so bad.

485
00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:03.087
And don't tell me anything.

486
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.393
I want everything to be
a surprise.

487
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.919
Oh. shoot. Cab is here.
I gotta go.

488
00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:09.833
I'll call you when we land.

489
00:21:10.007 --> 00:21:11.444
Good luck!

490
00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:13.141
We couldn't do this without you.
Literally.

491
00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.622
-Happy to help!
-Love you!

492
00:21:20.061 --> 00:21:23.282
So. uh. do you need a ride?

493
00:21:23.456 --> 00:21:26.285
Uh. my car is just around
the corner.

494
00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:27.895
I think I'll be fine.

495
00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:30.376
-Get home safe.
-You too.

496
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.900
And hey. since we can agree
on flowers.

497
00:21:33.074 --> 00:21:35.076
we can now agree
on anything.

498
00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:43.563
Oh. come on. please work.

499
00:21:45.173 --> 00:21:47.131
Maybe a little less bows?

500
00:21:51.266 --> 00:21:53.442
But I want something the wedding
guests will remember.

501
00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:57.098
But honey. the guests also have
to be able to sit.

502
00:21:57.272 --> 00:21:58.926
I am not cut out for this.

503
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.536
Pragmatism over personal touch.

504
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.059
That's why I do
corporate events.

505
00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:03.844
Not ribbons.

506
00:22:08.283 --> 00:22:12.940
-Try something like this.
-Your wedding album?

507
00:22:13.114 --> 00:22:14.507
I brought it over to show you.

508
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:17.031
Maybe you'll find
some inspiration.

509
00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:24.168
Here.

510
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:28.956
Oh Mom... It's perfect.

511
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.958
Your hair was so curly
back then.

512
00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:34.004
And a little less grey.
I may add.

513
00:22:34.178 --> 00:22:36.616
And Dad was so handsome.

514
00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:40.620
He took my breath away.
the moment I laid eyes on him.

515
00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:44.624
He used to say the same
about you.

516
00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:47.322
That photo album.

517
00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:50.325
you used to love going through
it when you were little.

518
00:22:50.499 --> 00:22:51.892
I did?

519
00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:53.633
Couldn't put it down.

520
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:57.071
And you definitely did not
hold back your thoughts.

521
00:22:57.245 --> 00:23:00.988
According to you.
my bouquet was boring.

522
00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:04.208
You said I should have carried
a Christmas tree.

523
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.123
I still stand by that.

524
00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:07.864
Ever since then.

525
00:23:08.038 --> 00:23:10.519
I thought you would make
a good wedding planner.

526
00:23:10.693 --> 00:23:12.521
Why didn't you ever say so?

527
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:15.611
I think it's important to figure
those things out for yourself.

528
00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:19.920
You never want someone else
to define your dreams for you.

529
00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:22.879
What if you're still trying
to figure out your dream?

530
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:25.969
You can only know if
you give something a try.

531
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:27.623
Take a risk.

532
00:23:27.797 --> 00:23:29.930
Kind of like these cookies.

533
00:23:30.104 --> 00:23:32.976
You go for a batch. and if
it's the right recipe.

534
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.500
it will work.

535
00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:36.632
Hand me the cinnamon.

536
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:42.290
Now. I have never used cinnamon
in this recipe before.

537
00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:43.857
might be risky.

538
00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:48.383
but you'll only know if it works
if we try.

539
00:23:55.738 --> 00:23:58.045
-Mm.
-Mm!

540
00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:02.876
See? Definitely worth the risk.

541
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.747
-It's really good.
-Mhmm.

542
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.586
I need a few more days
with the gears

543
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.979
while I wait for parts
to arrive.

544
00:24:19.153 --> 00:24:20.546
Then she's all yours.

545
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.069
Hey!

546
00:24:22.243 --> 00:24:23.549
Sorry. I thought I'd take
a look around.

547
00:24:23.723 --> 00:24:24.550
I hope you don't mind.

548
00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:26.160
No. no. not at all.

549
00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:30.251
Emma. this is Ed.
my favorite customer.

550
00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:32.340
He owns the bakery
down the street.

551
00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:33.907
Also. my favorite.

552
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:36.170
I pay him to say all that.

553
00:24:36.344 --> 00:24:38.607
Oh. do you happen to make
wedding cakes.

554
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.348
because we have a wedding
that could use one.

555
00:24:40.522 --> 00:24:43.046
You bet. I can make whatever
you would like.

556
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.440
Then we will have to keep you
in mind for cake testing.

557
00:24:45.614 --> 00:24:47.616
Well then I would be honored.

558
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.923
But. for now. I need to leave
you kids at it.

559
00:24:50.097 --> 00:24:52.578
I have some cupcakes that need
a tune up.

560
00:24:52.752 --> 00:24:54.057
Emma. it's a pleasure
meeting you.

561
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:55.015
You too. Ed.

562
00:24:55.189 --> 00:24:56.233
See ya.

563
00:24:56.407 --> 00:24:58.061
Thanks. Ed.

564
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.024
I bet you never thought you'd
see that tandem bike again?

565
00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:07.114
You know. I think my mistake
was letting you ride in front.

566
00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:09.116
I definitely should have taken
the lead.

567
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.466
I don't disagree.

568
00:25:13.294 --> 00:25:15.949
Not gonna lie. I wasn't sure
what to expect.

569
00:25:16.123 --> 00:25:17.994
but your shop is pretty cool.

570
00:25:18.168 --> 00:25:21.302
I'd like to think of it as much
more than just a bike shop.

571
00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:25.567
What are all of those. and why
are they hiding in the corner?

572
00:25:25.741 --> 00:25:28.135
Vintage bikes I'm working
on restoring.

573
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:30.006
It's a bit of a passion project
for me.

574
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.268
I bet they sell like crazy.

575
00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:33.532
You'd be surprised.

576
00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:36.186
It's hard for someone
to walk in here and want
a souped-up Riley Ranger

577
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.928
when they can roll out
with an electric bike.

578
00:25:39.102 --> 00:25:41.235
I'm not certain what
a Riley Ranger is.

579
00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:42.976
but it sounds neat.

580
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.499
It's actually really neat.

581
00:25:44.673 --> 00:25:47.154
It was crowned the first
safety bike.

582
00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:51.027
Picture it. the first cruiser
of its kind.

583
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:54.988
Well. it looks like you have
your work cut out for you.

584
00:25:55.162 --> 00:25:56.946
They may look rusty.

585
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.123
but giving 'em a second chance
and they can surprise you.

586
00:26:01.168 --> 00:26:03.300
Anyways. enough bike nerd talk.

587
00:26:03.474 --> 00:26:06.347
We have a music date
with the Wishing Bells.

588
00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:08.175
We do.

589
00:26:08.349 --> 00:26:11.613
Let me just get this dirty
apron off and let's go.

590
00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:19.012
Risky. hard to pull off.
but worth it.

591
00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:21.623
Risky? Try overwhelmingly
cheesy.

592
00:26:21.797 --> 00:26:24.365
and if even one person
is off beat...

593
00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:25.932
But everyone loves a flash mob.

594
00:26:28.717 --> 00:26:32.373
Earth to Liam. no flash
mobs allowed.

595
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:35.028
Even if I let you finish
these fries?

596
00:26:35.202 --> 00:26:37.508
Tempting. but no.

597
00:26:37.683 --> 00:26:39.249
Ok.

598
00:26:39.423 --> 00:26:41.382
Then there better be
a lot of dancing.

599
00:26:41.556 --> 00:26:44.211
There will be. as long as
we find a great band.

600
00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:46.866
I'm still deciding if
I like this one or not.

601
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.390
Well. personally.

602
00:26:49.564 --> 00:26:51.522
I think if we want to find
the perfect band

603
00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:54.264
we gotta dance to them first.

604
00:26:54.438 --> 00:26:56.397
Yeah. you have fun with that.

605
00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.400
No. seriously. I'm really
not a good dancer.

606
00:26:59.574 --> 00:27:01.097
I find that hard to believe.

607
00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:05.058
I promise. no flash mobs.

608

♪

609
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:15.938
Oh. I'm sorry.

610
00:27:16.112 --> 00:27:17.984
I told you I'm really not good
at this.

611
00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:21.291
You really don't give yourself
enough credit.

612
00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:24.164
Let me let you in on
a little secret.

613
00:27:24.338 --> 00:27:30.431
It's not all about the hips.
it's actually your knees.

614
00:27:30.605 --> 00:27:33.173
Who taught you how to dance?

615
00:27:33.347 --> 00:27:35.088
My grandma.

616
00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:38.091
She also gave me my first bike.

617
00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:44.140
She sounds like a special lady.

618
00:27:44.314 --> 00:27:50.103
She was. And she also
taught me this.

619
00:27:57.327 --> 00:28:00.156
Well. you two sure
impressed us.

620
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.984
Helps when you have
a great partner.

621
00:28:02.158 --> 00:28:05.379
Sounds like you got yourself
a good one... like me.

622
00:28:05.553 --> 00:28:06.946
Oh. no we're not...

623
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.469
And. if you want to keep her.

624
00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:11.820
never stop dancing
and never give up.

625
00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:12.952
Thank you.

626
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.436
Really makes you want to find
someone to grow old together.

627
00:28:23.136 --> 00:28:27.618
So. what do we think?
Still too big in my shoulders?

628
00:28:27.793 --> 00:28:30.447
Are you bringing a date
to the wedding?

629
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:33.146
A date? I thought you were
my date.

630
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.540
I'm serious. I think it could be
really good for you.

631
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.891
We could even set you up
on a dating website.

632
00:28:39.065 --> 00:28:40.153
A dating app?

633
00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:42.024
How am I supposed to do that

634
00:28:42.198 --> 00:28:44.984
when I can barely figure out
the camera on my phone?

635
00:28:45.158 --> 00:28:46.855
Ah. count me out.

636
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:49.031
I'm not saying you have
to get married or anything.

637
00:28:49.205 --> 00:28:50.903
but don't you think
it would be nice

638
00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:53.209
to have someone
in your life?

639
00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:56.430
Don't Miranda and I tell you
the same thing?

640
00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:58.867
I don't want you worried
about me.

641
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:01.522
I'll find someone
when the timing is right.

642
00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:03.176
In the meantime.

643
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.918
I want to spend some time
with my best friend.

644
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.920
Who's that? Do I know her?

645
00:29:08.094 --> 00:29:11.140
Does she have someone
she could introduce you to?

646
00:29:11.314 --> 00:29:13.055
I'm looking at her.

647
00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:16.842
Just promise me.

648
00:29:17.016 --> 00:29:19.888
if you meet the right person.
you'll give him a chance?

649

Dad would have wanted you to.

650
00:29:22.456 --> 00:29:24.371
I promise.

651
00:29:27.678 --> 00:29:29.376
Now. do you think
she'll like it?

table setting

Plates. silverware. glasses
and napkins.

Four on my count.

And place cards. favors.
stationary...

663

Sweetheart. the whole point
to you holding the basket

664
00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:03.236
is so I can place things
in the basket.

665
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:07.022
Sorry. My mind is kind of
all over the place.

666

takes care of all that.

Ed. please. take.
take the last one.

00:30:53.503 --> 00:30:57.594
Too late. turns out I remember
I have some back in the.

689
00:30:57.768 --> 00:30:58.944
in the house. yeah.

690
00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:02.208

Well. that was very nice.

Oh. he was just
being neighborly.

696
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:19.878
Mom. he runs his own bakery.

697
00:31:20.052 --> 00:31:23.359

Now. don't make me feel bad.
We should go drop it off to him.

No. I'm not trying to make you
feel bad. Mom.

700

Shh. Keep your voice down!

703
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:38.200
She's still got it.

704
00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:40.550
Shh. You're so bad.

705
00:31:50.386 --> 00:31:52.911
He wanted a portable charger?
For his bike?

706
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:54.173
Apparently. he likes
to read his texts

707
00:31:54.347 --> 00:31:55.696
and listen to his podcasts.

708
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.046
-While he rides?
-Yeah.

709
00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.308
You shouldn't be looking down
at your phone

710
00:31:59.482 --> 00:32:00.919
when you can be enjoying
the road.

711
00:32:01.093 --> 00:32:02.964
But. if he does. we have
a charger for that.

712
00:32:03.138 --> 00:32:04.487
Just got a shipment in
yesterday.

713
00:32:06.707 --> 00:32:08.535
Happy texting and biking!

714
00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:10.624
Make sure you don't forget
to look up.

715
00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:13.583
Can you believe that?

716
00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:15.846
Pretty soon people won't
leave their house to bike.

717
00:32:16.021 --> 00:32:17.892
I think that's already a thing.

718
00:32:18.066 --> 00:32:20.025
Sometimes I think I was born
in the wrong century.

719
00:32:20.199 --> 00:32:23.071
Right? Send me back
to 1920s Paris.

720
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:25.204
I'd make a great
tormented writer.

721
00:32:25.378 --> 00:32:26.945
I'm serious.

722
00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:28.555
What's the point of restoring
a vintage bike

723
00:32:28.729 --> 00:32:30.949
if it's just gonna sit there
and collect dust?

724
00:32:31.123 --> 00:32:32.994
You just need to find the right
person to see their worth.

725
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:36.606
Oh. hey.

726
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.869
I'm early. I know. But. I think
I solved the table setting.

727
00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:40.480
Ooh. fancy.

728
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:41.916
I just found these
at the farmer's market

729
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.962
and they're over 50 years old.

730
00:32:44.136 --> 00:32:46.660
How perfect are they?
And. I got them for pennies.

731
00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:49.576
Apparently old linens aren't
exactly flying off the shelves.

732
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.360
But Brett and Miranda
will love them.

733
00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:53.145
Yep.

734
00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:55.234
Just took the right person
to see their worth.

735
00:32:55.408 --> 00:32:56.887
So. are you hungry?

736
00:32:57.062 --> 00:32:58.324
I haven't eaten all day.

737
00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:00.413
Great. because I brought
score cards.

738
00:33:00.587 --> 00:33:02.502
Perfect. Hold down the fort?

739
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:04.112
Like always.

740
00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:09.988
Three. two. one.

741
00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:11.815
Six?

742
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.427
I use this place all the time
for my corporate events.

743
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:17.430
That's how we were able
to get a private tasting.

744
00:33:17.604 --> 00:33:20.085
Well. I think they could have
used more bacon.

745
00:33:22.565 --> 00:33:24.002
Thank you.

746
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:29.268
So. what's a corporate event?
Is that like a CEO's wedding?

747
00:33:29.442 --> 00:33:33.141
I wish. No. it's usually

748
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:35.100
business retreats. big meetings.
fundraisers.

749
00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:37.102
That type of thing.

750
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:41.454
That actually sounds
kind of exciting.

751
00:33:41.628 --> 00:33:43.978
If I'm being totally honest.

752
00:33:44.152 --> 00:33:46.633
the job isn't exactly what
I imagined it would be.

753
00:33:46.807 --> 00:33:49.418
It's way more about logistics

754
00:33:49.592 --> 00:33:52.465
than it is about turning
visions into reality.

755
00:33:52.639 --> 00:33:55.294
Well. if it's not what
you hoped it would be.

756
00:33:55.468 --> 00:33:57.209
why don't you branch out
on your own

757
00:33:57.383 --> 00:33:59.994
and actually do the events
that you dreamed of?

758
00:34:00.168 --> 00:34:02.475
You clearly have a talent
for weddings.

759
00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:07.001
Plus. I actually just got
offered a promotion at work.

760
00:34:07.175 --> 00:34:08.829
That's awesome.

761
00:34:09.003 --> 00:34:12.006
What's not so awesome.
I'd have to move to Seattle.

762
00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:18.882
Sometimes change can be good.

763
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.884
And. for what it's worth.

764
00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:24.366
I think that if you ventured out
on your own.

765
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.499
you'd be really good at it.

766
00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:36.161
You need some help
over there?

767
00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:42.906
I'm sorry. it's just.
you're always going on about

768
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.648
how things should be meaningful.

769
00:34:45.822 --> 00:34:49.739
And this place. just doesn't
seem like you.

770
00:34:53.178 --> 00:34:55.963
I guess it doesn't seem
like Brett and Miranda either.

771
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:57.965
What other options do you have?

772
00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:01.490
I don't. And I don't have any
time to find another caterer.

773
00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:03.405
That's why you have me.

774
00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:06.495
You're not doing this on
your own. remember?

775
00:35:07.714 --> 00:35:10.369
I'm thinking we should get out
of this place.

776
00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:12.588
I'm right behind you.

777
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:27.037
♪

778
00:35:28.038 --> 00:35:29.344
-Mm.
-Mm.

779
00:35:29.518 --> 00:35:31.912
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

780
00:35:32.086 --> 00:35:33.740
I wonder if Brett and Miranda

781
00:35:33.914 --> 00:35:36.264
would want burgers and fries
for their wedding meal?

782
00:35:36.438 --> 00:35:38.875
I'd take this over those
lobster tails any day.

783
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:42.270
We can't actually serve
fast food at their wedding.

784
00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:46.100
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

785
00:35:46.274 --> 00:35:49.234
We'll figure it out.
I promise.

786
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:51.540
Let's start with a brainstorm.

787
00:35:58.373 --> 00:36:00.201
What is this?

788
00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:03.073
These are just some
wedding planning notes.

789
00:36:03.248 --> 00:36:05.859
No. this.

790
00:36:06.033 --> 00:36:07.077
-That?
-Mm-hm.

791
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:08.644
Just something I was sketching

792
00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:09.950
while I was daydreaming
the other day.

793
00:36:10.124 --> 00:36:13.910
And is that a... a frog?

794
00:36:14.084 --> 00:36:15.173
No.

795
00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:19.002
It's a bicycle.

796
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:20.787
That's supposed to be a bicycle?

797
00:36:20.961 --> 00:36:23.833
Hey. I fix bikes. not draw them.
cut me some slack. ok.

798
00:36:24.007 --> 00:36:27.141
I would. it's just. are there
even handle bars?

799
00:36:27.315 --> 00:36:29.970
Fair enough. All right.
I'm no Van Gogh.

800
00:36:30.144 --> 00:36:32.886
But thankfully I don't need
a logo just yet.

801
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.932
because my vintage bikes aren't
exactly flying off the shelf.

802
00:36:36.106 --> 00:36:38.283
One day. hopefully.

803
00:36:38.457 --> 00:36:40.981
Well. for what it's worth.

804
00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:44.985
Bowentown Bicycles
has a nice to ring to it.

805
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:46.639
I think so. too.

806
00:36:46.813 --> 00:36:51.470
And your passion for this
is really inspiring.

807
00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:53.472
It's the only thing I've ever
been really passionate about.

808
00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.256
And it was instant.

809
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.606
Ever since that first bike
with training wheels.

810
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.042
The one your grandmother
gave you?

811
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.957
Yep.

812
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:03.395
She taught me how to ride
without training wheels too.

813
00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:05.484
I'll never forget the day
she took them off.

814
00:37:05.658 --> 00:37:08.443
She reminded me to just
keep peddling.

815
00:37:08.617 --> 00:37:10.532
gave me a big hug

816
00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:12.926
and sent me down
that neighborhood hill.

817
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.363
Sure enough. I just
kept peddling

818
00:37:15.537 --> 00:37:18.366
and haven't stopped since.

819
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.848
Somehow my first bike ride ended
up with me falling in a puddle

820
00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:25.504
and seeing my dad laugh
like I had never seen before.

821
00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:26.853
Oh no.

822
00:37:27.027 --> 00:37:28.507
Well. good or bad.

823
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:30.117
it's one of those days
that everyone remembers.

824
00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:32.859
Or. the first time they rode
a tandem bike.

825
00:37:33.033 --> 00:37:35.078
Almost ended up with us
in a puddle too.

826
00:37:43.217 --> 00:37:46.960
Find a good caterer.
Find a good caterer.

827
00:37:47.134 --> 00:37:49.049
I will find.. ugh!

828
00:37:49.223 --> 00:37:51.878
Mom. can you pass me the other
stacks of menus. please?

829
00:37:52.052 --> 00:37:53.749
Don't you think you should
take a break?

830
00:37:53.923 --> 00:37:56.230
I can't. I have to find at least
one option for tomorrow

831
00:37:56.404 --> 00:37:57.797
if I want a tasting.

832
00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.189
Caterers need plenty of time
to prepare

833
00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:00.974
and we're already pushing it.

834
00:38:01.148 --> 00:38:04.369
I think you're pushing
your sanity too.

835
00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:06.980
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
I'm not...

836
00:38:07.154 --> 00:38:09.896
You'll get them back
when you relax a bit.

837
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.246
What is with everyone
and relaxing.

838
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.119
Now. do you remember
our favorite thing to do

839
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.905
when you'd get overwhelmed
when you were little?

840
00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:20.515
No. Not gonna happen.

841
00:38:22.256 --> 00:38:23.562
Hold the bowl steady.
Mom!

842
00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:24.867
The batter's going everywhere.

843
00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:31.047
Ok. lift a little higher
and to the left and pour!

844
00:38:31.221 --> 00:38:33.006
I forgot how hard this is.

845
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.573
Perfect.

846
00:38:38.011 --> 00:38:40.405
See? It doesn't hurt
to take a break.

847
00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:44.409
Oh. It's Liam.

848
00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:46.889
He said he found
the perfect caterer.

849
00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:49.109
See? I told you it would
work out.

850
00:38:49.283 --> 00:38:52.112
And now you have time to help me
finish what we started.

851
00:38:52.286 --> 00:38:53.983
Ooh. sorry.

852
00:38:54.157 --> 00:38:56.290

Yeah. I figured since she helps

879
00:40:41.526 --> 00:40:42.352
This way.

880
00:40:42.527 --> 00:40:43.789
-Yep.
-Yep.

881
00:40:48.707 --> 00:40:52.711
♪

882
00:40:57.063 --> 00:40:59.108
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Liam.

883
00:40:59.282 --> 00:41:02.024
but you could be right
about this place.

884
00:41:02.198 --> 00:41:06.507
Wow. Let me take a moment
here to enjoy this.

885
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:10.032
Emma Hall thinks I'm right.

886
00:41:10.206 --> 00:41:11.469
Could be.

887
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:14.733
♪

888
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:19.041
So. are you bringing anyone
to the wedding?

889
00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:20.434
No. I don't think so.

890
00:41:20.608 --> 00:41:22.305
Why not?

891
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.091
Weddings come with
a lot of pressure.

892
00:41:25.265 --> 00:41:27.485
I think a wedding date
should be someone special.

893
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:31.271
Until I meet that someone.
I'm flying solo.

894
00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:33.447
You?

895
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:35.362
I'm flying solo too.

896
00:41:35.536 --> 00:41:38.017
I haven't really been in
the dating market as of late.

897
00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:39.845
No time.

898
00:41:40.019 --> 00:41:43.065
Plus. I want all my focus
to be on Miranda that day.

899
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.115
So. what's the verdict?

900
00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:56.122
Three. two. one.

901
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.214
I think it's safe to say
we're finally in sync.

902
00:42:01.388 --> 00:42:03.390
Or in tandem.

903
00:42:05.827 --> 00:42:09.091
Hey. do you maybe want to take
a walk around?

904
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:10.963
-Yes.
-And check out the property.

905
00:42:11.137 --> 00:42:15.968
I mean. sure.
A walk sounds nice.

906
00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:19.362
Actually. I have a better idea.

907
00:42:22.322 --> 00:42:24.585
They keep these on the property
for anyone to go explore.

908
00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:27.849
Although these babies have
definitely seen better days.

909
00:42:28.023 --> 00:42:29.634
Which is too bad.

910
00:42:29.808 --> 00:42:31.505
because this place would be
perfect for bike riding.

911
00:42:31.679 --> 00:42:33.986
Seems like they could use
some of your refurbished bikes.

912
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.683
Maybe you should sell
them some?

913
00:42:35.857 --> 00:42:37.337
You know. I've never thought
of that before.

914
00:42:37.511 --> 00:42:39.034
Something to consider.

915
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:40.993
Clearly. they love
the vintage bike look

916
00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:44.300
but could use some
that have been fixed up.

917
00:42:44.474 --> 00:42:46.041
-Shall we?
-Mm-hm.

918
00:42:55.616 --> 00:42:57.357
You do that on purpose?

919
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.838
I have no idea what
you're talking about?

920
00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:09.891
Man. this place looks like
it's out of a fairy story.

921
00:43:10.065 --> 00:43:12.415
You mean fairy tale?

922
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.896
Story. tale. they both work.

923
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.639
Except that a fairy tale
is an actual word.

924
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:20.902
You see. that's the corporate
events world in you talking.

925
00:43:21.076 --> 00:43:25.211
You have to leave room
for spontaneity.

926
00:43:25.385 --> 00:43:27.561
Only if you leave room
for a dictionary.

927
00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:32.958
I have to bring Miranda
back here.

928
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:35.569
She would love this.

929
00:43:35.743 --> 00:43:39.225
If Miranda loves it.
Brett will too.

930
00:43:39.399 --> 00:43:42.228
They do see eye to eye
on everything.

931
00:43:42.402 --> 00:43:44.056
Pretty perfect for each other.

932
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.710
Did you know that
after their first date.

933
00:43:45.884 --> 00:43:48.408
Brett called me and said
"I have met my wife."

934
00:43:48.582 --> 00:43:50.932
No. I had no idea.

935
00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:54.544
Yep. Said he had met
the woman of his dreams.

936
00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:57.025
Hasn't looked back since.

937
00:43:57.199 --> 00:43:59.941
I think Miranda knew
pretty early on too.

938
00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:03.902
They have that connection.
you know. that spark.

939
00:44:04.076 --> 00:44:06.992
That's what I want.

940
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:11.561
That's nice that you know
what you want.

941
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:13.085
You don't?

942
00:44:13.259 --> 00:44:15.000
You seem like the person

943
00:44:15.174 --> 00:44:17.524
that has the next ten years
of their lives mapped out.

944
00:44:17.698 --> 00:44:21.920
-You'd be surprised.
-Surprise me.

945
00:44:22.094 --> 00:44:25.140
When it comes to relationships.

946
00:44:25.314 --> 00:44:32.104
for so long I knew my dream man
down to the tie he wore.

947
00:44:32.278 --> 00:44:37.936
And I found him.
or I thought I did.

948
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.460
You can feel like you have
all the pieces

949
00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:45.030
and still find yourself picking
them up when things end.

950
00:44:45.204 --> 00:44:47.554
Doesn't mean you shouldn't
stop looking.

951
00:44:50.426 --> 00:44:53.168
No. It doesn't.

952
00:44:57.172 --> 00:44:59.522
-Race you back?
-Bring it on.

953
00:45:16.104 --> 00:45:17.584
Hi. how's it going over there?

954
00:45:17.758 --> 00:45:19.238
It is going great.

955
00:45:19.412 --> 00:45:22.023
Had a huge meeting today.
Miranda crushed it.

956
00:45:22.197 --> 00:45:24.634
Only because somebody
gave me the best notes.

957
00:45:24.809 --> 00:45:28.116
Oh. wow. you guys!
That's awesome.

958
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.337
Wow. what's gotten into you?
Someone's happy today.

959
00:45:31.511 --> 00:45:32.991
I just had a fun day is all.

960
00:45:33.165 --> 00:45:34.514
With Liam?

961
00:45:34.688 --> 00:45:37.343
Yes. with Liam.
But it's nothing.

962
00:45:37.517 --> 00:45:40.563
We're just getting along better
than I expected.

963
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:42.391
You sure it couldn't be
something more?

964
00:45:42.565 --> 00:45:44.872
If it was something more.
I'd know. right?

965
00:45:45.046 --> 00:45:47.222
I mean. you and Brett knew you
were going to get married

966
00:45:47.396 --> 00:45:48.920
the moment you first met.

967
00:45:49.094 --> 00:45:51.226
Uh. Brett knew we were
going to get married.

968
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.837
I. on the other hand.

969
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.360
wasn't sure that I wanted
to see him again.

970
00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:57.058
What? He planned a picnic
under the stars.

971
00:45:57.232 --> 00:45:58.843
It was near perfect.

972
00:45:59.017 --> 00:46:00.409
That was our first date.

973
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:02.847
But our first meeting
was a disaster.

974
00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:04.544
I spilled coffee on him

975
00:46:04.718 --> 00:46:05.850
and he told me I reminded him
of his mother.

976
00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:08.940
Wow. I forgot about that.

977
00:46:09.114 --> 00:46:10.506
Yep.

978
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.986
Can't imagine what life
would be like

979
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.205
if I hadn't given him
a second chance.

980
00:46:14.684 --> 00:46:15.860
Oh. hang on. sis.
That's Liam.

981
00:46:16.034 --> 00:46:18.253
Oh. you guys are hanging out?

982
00:46:18.427 --> 00:46:20.560
He's just dropping off recs
for beverage vendors.

983
00:46:20.734 --> 00:46:21.909
Calm down.

984
00:46:22.083 --> 00:46:23.171
I'll call you back in five.

985
00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:24.999
Bye.

986
00:46:27.741 --> 00:46:30.570
There's literally every type of
drink vendor here known to man.

987
00:46:30.744 --> 00:46:32.224
I threw my five favorite
at the top

988
00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:34.400
and threw some extra
just in case.

989
00:46:34.574 --> 00:46:37.229
Wow. Liam. I am impressed.

990
00:46:37.403 --> 00:46:38.752
I aim to please.

991
00:46:41.059 --> 00:46:42.974
That's it for today. right?

992
00:46:43.148 --> 00:46:44.105
Yeah.

993
00:46:44.279 --> 00:46:46.368
Ok. I'm gonna go.

994
00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:52.592
Wait. actually. since you're
here. I could use your help.

995
00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:54.855
I was just working
on the mood board.

996
00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:55.987
Mood board?

997
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:57.466
Mm-hm. Ok.

998
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.599
I do this for all my events.

999
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:02.080
I want the board to reflect
the mood of the wedding.

1000
00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:05.953
So. right now I see
excitement. hope.

1001
00:47:06.127 --> 00:47:07.346
New beginnings?

1002
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.826
Exactly.

1003
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.525
But. it's missing something.

1004
00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:16.398
Something like this?

1005
00:47:16.572 --> 00:47:19.401
-Tennis shoes.
-It's the vibe we need.

1006
00:47:20.663 --> 00:47:23.144
I guess I can get so wrapped up
in these things

1007
00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:27.453
being picture perfect that
I forget they can be fun too.

1008
00:47:27.627 --> 00:47:31.196
Like today was?
Super fun.

1009
00:47:34.982 --> 00:47:36.157
What?

1010
00:47:38.072 --> 00:47:42.947
Nothing. I just. I guess I never
thought I'd see you again

1011
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:45.036
after that first date.

1012
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.909
Let alone have you in my house.
helping me with a mood board.

1013
00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:51.651
Come on. that first date
wasn't that bad. was it?

1014
00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:54.262
No.

1015
00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:56.177
I guess it wasn't.

1016
00:47:58.179 --> 00:47:59.659
Turns out going out with
your friend's sister

1017
00:47:59.833 --> 00:48:02.140
can be kind of nerve-racking.

1018
00:48:02.314 --> 00:48:03.881
You were nervous?

1019
00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:05.795
I don't think I stopped talking.

1020
00:48:08.015 --> 00:48:09.887
You know. now that
I think about it.

1021
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:12.367
I don't think I got
a word in edgewise.

1022
00:48:12.541 --> 00:48:16.067
But. in your defense.

1023
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:20.506
I wasn't really ready
to open up.

1024
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.162
Isn't it funny
how time works?

1025
00:48:28.122 --> 00:48:29.863
Oh. That's Miranda.

1026
00:48:30.037 --> 00:48:31.865
I told her I'd call her back
and I didn't.

1027
00:48:32.039 --> 00:48:33.562
No worries.

1028
00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:37.871
Um. I should get going anyways.

1029
00:48:38.045 --> 00:48:39.873
Good night.

1030
00:48:40.047 --> 00:48:41.570
Ciao.

1031
00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:53.887
You know. in my day. I actually
made my own wedding cake?

1032
00:48:54.061 --> 00:48:57.064
You also had a year to prepare.

1033
00:48:57.238 --> 00:48:59.545
I want you to enjoy the day
as much as Miranda.

1034
00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:02.591
Not worry about anything
except showing up.

1035
00:49:02.765 --> 00:49:06.465
I'm just saying that if the
cakes don't impress us today.

1036
00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:08.206
you have options.

1037
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.251
Oh. no. We are finding
the perfect cake today.

1038
00:49:10.425 --> 00:49:12.166
There is no other option.

1039
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.387
That's why you're here. I need
your tasting expertise.

1040
00:49:15.561 --> 00:49:17.258
Ok. I'm all yours.

1041
00:49:17.432 --> 00:49:22.916
Now. let's go see who this baker
is with his fancy cakes.

1042
00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:24.831
I might just have to teach him
a thing or two.

1043
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:27.225
Right. About that.

1044
00:49:29.227 --> 00:49:31.142
-Hey.
-Hey.

1045
00:49:33.144 --> 00:49:35.973
Mom. you remember Ed.
from the farmer's market?

1046
00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:39.846
How could I forget?
I owe you a jar of honey.

1047
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.022
I heard you're quite
the baker yourself.

1048
00:49:42.196 --> 00:49:44.329
Maybe share a few tips
and we'll call it even.

1049
00:49:44.503 --> 00:49:46.853
Mel. thanks for joining us.
We need your expertise.

1050
00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:49.987
Thank Emma. She's the one

So. who's ready
for some tasting?

1053
00:50:00.388 --> 00:50:02.129
Mm.

1054
00:50:02.782 --> 00:50:04.305
Getting a head start?

1055
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.617
You know what they say.
The early bird gets the cake.

1056
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:12.835
Do they say that?

1057
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.924
Mm. That is really good.

1058
00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:17.579
Yeah. Oh. man.

1059

I don't know which one
to choose.

1060
00:50:24.108 --> 00:50:26.023
I loved every single one.

1061
00:50:26.197 --> 00:50:28.068
I did too. Ed.

1062
00:50:28.242 --> 00:50:31.202
Except. I'm wondering
if the cake needs to be

1063
00:50:31.376 --> 00:50:33.465
a little more... simple?

1064
00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:35.945
We're going colorful
with the flowers.

1065
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.643
and big with the band.

1066
00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:41.125
so maybe the cake could be
something classic.

1067
00:50:41.299 --> 00:50:42.996
Old school. even.

1068
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:46.304
Oh. how about a butter cake?

1069
00:50:46.478 --> 00:50:47.914
We used to sell one
at the bakery

1070
00:50:48.088 --> 00:50:49.611
and it was a hit
with the customers.

1071
00:50:49.785 --> 00:50:52.266
Wait. Mom. didn't you used
to make butter cakes

1073

couldn't get enough of them.

Oh. Emma. what
are you doing here?

1136
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:49.590
Coming into the office isn't
what I meant by taking time off.

1137

I know. but I just couldn't
help myself.

Oh. two plans.

00:54:59.818 --> 00:55:01.950
That's right. One is
the neutral version.

1142
00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:03.561
It was quite a feat
to tone it down.

1143
00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:05.476
but I think I managed.

1144
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:07.869
And the second one is my
last attempt to get them

1145
00:55:08.043 --> 00:55:09.915
to take a little risk.

1146
00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:11.917
I know they don't like big.
bold colors.

1147
00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:14.223
so I got creative
with the space.

1148
00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:16.269
I suggested a long
dessert table

1149
00:55:16.443 --> 00:55:18.271
and I thought a dance floor
would be fun.

1150
00:55:18.445 --> 00:55:21.274
I mean. business people
like to groove too.

1151
00:55:21.448 --> 00:55:25.104
You went above and beyond
as always. Emma.

1152
00:55:25.278 --> 00:55:27.541
I'll take these to the client
and see what they say.

1153
00:55:27.715 --> 00:55:29.282
Ok.

1154
00:55:29.456 --> 00:55:33.025
Oh. and Emma. please take
some time to relax

1155
00:55:33.199 --> 00:55:34.287

1156
00:55:34.461 --> 00:55:35.984

-Hey!

How'd it go?

1160

but my boss is hopeful.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:53.785

1163
00:55:55.787 --> 00:55:57.136

1165
00:56:00.574 --> 00:56:04.056
Just something small I sketched
between confirming RSVPs.

1166
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:07.494
Small. this is so cool!

1167
00:56:07.668 --> 00:56:09.931
Well. you mentioned you wanted
to get some customers

1168
00:56:10.105 --> 00:56:12.369
to buy your vintage bikes and
a little branding never hurts.

1169
00:56:12.543 --> 00:56:14.283
Is that a Riley Ranger
on the logo?

1170
00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:16.068
Just a personal touch.

1171
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:17.939

You don't have to say anything.

is help me decide

No. no. it's no one's fault.

They have to fix the plumbing
on the entire house.

1201
00:58:11.662 --> 00:58:14.186
Resod everything.
Could take weeks.

1202
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.449
And we can't push it back.

1203
00:58:16.623 --> 00:58:19.931
The date means everything
to Brett and Miranda.

1204

before the wedding?

1205
00:58:22.063 --> 00:58:23.978
This can't be happening!

1206
00:58:24.152 --> 00:58:25.806
I'm dreaming.
Am I dreaming?

1207
00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.242
Pinch me.
Here pinch me.

1208
00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:30.376
Hey. It's gonna be ok.

1209
00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:37.035
Miranda.

1213

1215

coming then?

1217
00:58:53.617 --> 00:58:54.966

1218

I know.

1219
00:58:56.881 --> 00:58:58.622
But there just isn't
anything we can do

1220

and you just said everything
is fine on your end.

1221
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:02.800
so just keep it that way
until we get there.

1222
00:59:02.974 --> 00:59:06.064

Thank you.

1224
00:59:10.285 --> 00:59:13.593
We're the wedding stand-ins.
We got this.

1225
00:59:14.986 --> 00:59:16.857
Hey. is this the MacMillan
Centre?

1226
00:59:17.031 --> 00:59:18.467
Yeah. I'm just calling to see
if you have any availability

1227
00:59:18.642 --> 00:59:20.339
for a wedding next week?

1228
00:59:22.036 --> 00:59:25.562
That's the thing.
it's actually next week.

1229
00:59:27.389 --> 00:59:29.043
All right.

1230
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:31.002
I appreciate your help.

1231
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.005
Bondel Horticultural Museum.

1232
00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:37.269
Hi there. I'm calling to see if
your museum can host a wedding?

1233
00:59:37.443 --> 00:59:38.966
Yeah. sure.

1234
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.446
That's great. It would be
for next week on...

1235
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.491
I'm so sorry.
we're booked.

1236
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:43.884
Shoot.

1237
00:59:44.058 --> 00:59:47.453
Ok. Thanks anyway.

1238
00:59:47.627 --> 00:59:50.238
The arboretum is booked
that day.

1239
00:59:50.412 --> 00:59:54.939
Are you sure the zoo
can't fit that many people?

1240
00:59:55.113 --> 00:59:58.029
What if we removed
the elephants?

1241
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.988
Thank you for trying.

1242
01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:03.512
Have a nice day.

1243
01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:12.913
Feeling lucky I tell you.
just around the corner.

1244
01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:15.089
Twelve times a charm. right?

1245
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.573
Just up ahead.

1246
01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:29.408
Lucky 13. then?

1247
01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:32.106
I don't think that's
how it works.

1248
01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:39.897
You tried the courthouse?

1249
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:41.942
Booked through next year.

1250
01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.031
I'm not sure if this
phone book helps.

1251
01:00:44.205 --> 01:00:45.990
I think half these places
are out of business.

1252
01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:48.383
I'd offer my bakery but I don't
know if you want people

1253
01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:51.909
making wedding toasts
next to an oven.

1254
01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:53.084
Bit on the nose?

1255
01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:55.477
There has to be another option.

1256
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:59.873
What about a sushi restaurant?
Koi fish can be romantic. right?

1257
01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.309
I guess we're gonna have
to get creative.

1258
01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:02.876
You know. think outside
the box?

1259
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.270
But it can't be just anywhere.

1260
01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:07.489
It needs to be someplace
special.

1261
01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.578
Something...

1262
01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.668
Out of a fairy story.

1263
01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:16.585
You call the vendors.
I'll go to the venue.

1264
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.326
Got it.

1265
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.980
Ed. do you mind if I borrow
her for something?

1266
01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:21.721
It's important.

1267
01:01:21.895 --> 01:01:23.680
By all means. you're the one
who got her going.

1268
01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:25.029
you might as well be the one
to take her on her first spin.

1269
01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:26.117
Thanks. Ed.

1270
01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:29.033
First. I gotta make a call.

1271
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:33.167
Hey. Natalie. do you have
a second?

1272
01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:36.127
Check it out.

1273
01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.697
Yeah. love it.

1274
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.185
Hey. Natalie.
thanks for everything.

1275
01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:04.546
Danielle. Hi.

1276
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.157
Hi. how are you doing?

1277
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:07.375
The wedding's right around
the corner.

1278
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.029
Literally.

1279
01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:11.553
Uh. it's been a whirlwind
to say the least.

1280
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.991
And hopefully
insightful.

1281
01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:15.644
It's giving me a lot
to think about.

1282
01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.517
Well good. because
that's why I called.

1283
01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.867
I pitched your updated designs.

1284
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:21.999
And?

1285
01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:25.219
And the client loved it.

1286
01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:27.569
They did? The dance floor
and all?

1287
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.963
The dance floor and all.

1288
01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:33.053
Danielle. you don't know
how happy I am to hear that.

1289
01:02:33.227 --> 01:02:34.925
Well good. They are going
to make some adjustments

1290
01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:37.928
and they'll get their ideas
back to us soon.

1291
01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:40.887
I also just got off the phone
with my partners.

1292
01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:42.889
They're very excited about you.

1293
01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.978
We all want you to know
that you're going to be able

1294
01:02:45.152 --> 01:02:49.069
to take risks and push yourself
and focus on your vision.

1295
01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.070
Really?

1296
01:02:50.244 --> 01:02:52.029
Yeah.

1297
01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.552
You won't just be arranging
small business lunches.

1298
01:02:53.726 --> 01:02:55.859
We're talking conferences
and trade shows

1299
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:57.382
and executive programs.

1300
01:02:57.556 --> 01:02:59.471
Product launches.

1301
01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:02.996
So. color. theme. decorations
wise. it's all pretty standard.

1302
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:06.043
but what these events lack
in personality.

1303
01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:09.611
they absolutely make up
for in diversity.

1304
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.526
You really will get
to experience it all.

1305
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.920
All except weddings.

1306
01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:15.530
Definitely not weddings.

1307
01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.753
Well. thanks for the call.
We'll talk soon.

1308
01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:33.418
-Liam!
-Ed!

1309
01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:36.508
How'd it go?

1310
01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:39.337
You were right.
This is one lucky bike.

1311
01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:42.340
And one lucky cupcake.

1312
01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:45.125
-Is that for me?
-That's for you.

1313
01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.779
She's all yours.
Thank you.

1314
01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.044
Honey. I'm sure their flight
just got a little delayed.

1315
01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.916
It's nothing to worry about.

1316
01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.874
No one texted me
before takeoff

1317
01:03:55.048 --> 01:03:56.615
and. I mean. why would they?

1318
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:58.486
They're just the bride
and groom.

1319
01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.140
It's not like they should
check in with me or anything.

1320
01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:02.012
No. that would be crazy.

1321
01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:04.492
I'm sure they're flying
right above us as we speak.

1322
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:06.581
They better be.

1323
01:04:06.755 --> 01:04:07.931
I'm just not sure if I'm going
to hug them or hyperventilate

1324
01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:09.410
when they finally get here.

1325
01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:11.978
I would hug.
But that's just me.

1326
01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:14.981
I'm sure tomorrow's going
to be wonderful. Emma.

1327
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:17.157
You and Liam have worked
so hard.

1328
01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:21.292
I just want you to be able
to enjoy the wedding too.

1329
01:04:21.466 --> 01:04:22.946
It's kind of hard

1330
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.469
when you're worried
about the bride and groom

1331
01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:26.514
getting stuck in a different
time zone.

1332
01:04:26.688 --> 01:04:31.041
Do you want to do some baking?
That might help you relax.

1333
01:04:31.215 --> 01:04:34.218
Italian wedding cookies.
in honor of the occasion?

1334
01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.220
Thanks. Mom.

1335
01:04:36.394 --> 01:04:39.005
But. I actually have to drop off
Miranda's dress at her house.

1336
01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:40.877
Maybe I'll wait for them
to get home too

1337
01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:43.183
since I can't rely on her
to call me.

1338
01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:45.316
Ah. ah. remember.

1339
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.448
Hug her when she comes through
the door.

1340
01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:48.972
No hyperventilating.

1341
01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:51.061
I'll do my best.

1342
01:04:52.323 --> 01:04:55.543
Woah. you're kicking things
into high gear. literally.

1343
01:04:55.717 --> 01:04:58.068
Well. Brett and Miranda land
tonight and I promised Emma

1344
01:04:58.242 --> 01:05:00.113
I'd be in full wedding mode
in case she needs me.

1345
01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:01.810
I think you both have been
in wedding mode

1346
01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.029
for the past six weeks now.

1347
01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:04.074
Fair point.

1348
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:05.902
How're you feeling?

1349
01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:08.948
About the wedding? Good.

1350
01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:10.907
Honestly? Proud.

1351
01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:13.518
I think Brett and Miranda
are gonna be really moved.

1352
01:05:13.692 --> 01:05:17.435
Emma. what she's done.
she's incredible.

1353
01:05:19.045 --> 01:05:20.003
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

1354
01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:21.830
She's just...

1355
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.571
I'm glad it all
worked out

1356
01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:25.834
and we ended up working
really well together.

1357
01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.053
Stop doing that.

1358
01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:28.228
What. I'm not doing anything.

1359
01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:30.361
Clearly. Pass me the wrench.

1360
01:05:32.537 --> 01:05:34.539
One last thing here.

1361
01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.107
Finished.

1362
01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:38.456
Now. we wait for the bride
and groom to arrive

1363
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:40.197
so the fun can begin.

1364
01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:42.982
But the real fun is how
you get them to leave.

1365
01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:45.115
That's always my favorite part.

1366
01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:47.508
Leave.

1367
01:05:47.682 --> 01:05:49.032
Yeah. are you doing
the old car and cans

1368
01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:51.034
or did you need me
to go paint

1369
01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:52.905
"just married" on
the windshield?

1370
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:54.907
Oh. yeah. We completely
forgot about that part.

1371
01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:58.302
Oh. that's kind of a big thing
to forget.

1372
01:05:58.476 --> 01:06:00.347
Call Emma. I'm sure she'll have
a binder full of ideas.

1373
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:03.046
Nope. she has enough
on her plate.

1374
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.091
I got this.

1375
01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:11.141
♪

1376
01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:16.059
Miranda. where are you?

1377
01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:27.809
Hey. we're back.

1378
01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.898
Last wedding detail.

1379
01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:32.075
Feels so good to be home.

1380
01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:33.554
Tell me about it.

1381
01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.034
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

1382
01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:36.427
Ah. well it wouldn't be
a wedding

1383
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:37.906
without a little
last-minute stress.

1384
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.996
Again. not laughing.

1385
01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:41.867
Bring it in. you deserve a hug.

1386
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:43.695
And a spa day.

1387
01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:45.958
Not until I see the two of you
walk down the aisle.

1388
01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:47.438
and tell me that's
still happening.

1389
01:06:47.612 --> 01:06:49.440
No last-minute consulting
catastrophes?

1390
01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:53.313
We are officially consulting
catastrophe free.

1391
01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:56.925
I'm so happy to hear that.
And I'm thrilled you are home.

1392
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.579
Everything's ready.

1393
01:06:58.753 --> 01:07:00.320
Wow.

1394
01:07:00.494 --> 01:07:02.540
I am marrying the greatest
woman in the world

1395
01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:06.587
and getting a pretty incredible
sister-in-law because of it.

1396
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.982
All right. ladies. I have a hot
date with a bubble bath.

1397
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:12.811
Wedding pampering
officially starts now.

1398
01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:14.378
I gotta look my best
for the big day. right?

1399
01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:15.509
Mm-hm.

1400
01:07:24.475 --> 01:07:29.349
Emma. that dress.
It's gorgeous.

1401
01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:33.092
And. are you ready for
one last wedding surprise?

1402
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.750
I figured you'd be
more comfortable in these.

1403
01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.449
Ah! Tennis shoes.

1404
01:07:42.623 --> 01:07:44.321
So. I don't have to
wear heels.

1405
01:07:44.495 --> 01:07:46.888
Is this really a gift
from Emma Hall?

1406
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.847
Let's just say.
since you left

1407
01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:51.197
I've become a little
more spontaneous.

1408
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:53.895
Well. planning a wedding
in six weeks would do that.

1409
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.897
And. if you don't like
what've we've put together.

1410
01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:59.031
just blame Liam.

1411
01:07:59.205 --> 01:08:01.990
I am quite sure that whatever
you and Liam put together

1412
01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:06.038
will be everything and more.

1413
01:08:06.212 --> 01:08:08.867
Truly Emma. I am so grateful.

1414
01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:14.829
You are the best Maid of Honor
and the greatest sister.

1415
01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:17.180
How did I get so lucky?

1416
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.140
Ok.

1417
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:23.229
Enough pre-wedding emotions.

1418
01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:25.144
I am not supposed to cry
until tomorrow.

1419
01:08:25.318 --> 01:08:27.538
I am prepared for that as well.

1420
01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.888
You thought of everything.

1421
01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.847
Details are where I thrive.

1422
01:08:33.021 --> 01:08:37.243
Except. you forgot one detail
for yourself.

1423
01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:39.115
A date to the wedding.

1424
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:41.943
I told you I didn't want
to bring anyone.

1425
01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.946
I want to be focused on you.
not some random date.

1426
01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.559
I can think of one person you
could bring who isn't random.

1427
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.476
What's holding you back?

1428
01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:57.002
I guess. I just don't know
how he feels about me.

1429
01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:59.222
But do you know how you feel
about him?

1430
01:09:00.571 --> 01:09:02.964
Then tell him.

1431
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.532
I know that you're scared.

1432
01:09:05.706 --> 01:09:08.100
but you can't live
your life afraid.

1433
01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:10.407
You have to chase after
your dreams.

1434
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:12.409
Not hide from them.

1435
01:09:15.977 --> 01:09:18.110
-I love you.
-I love you.

1436
01:09:21.374 --> 01:09:23.942
I am confident.
I am brave.

1437
01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:28.294
I will chase my dreams.
not hide from them.

1438
01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:39.044
Sounds like a plan
to me.

1439
01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:41.133
And Natalie. let's just keep
this between us. ok?

1440
01:09:41.307 --> 01:09:42.874
I don't want to get ahead
of myself.

1441
01:09:43.048 --> 01:09:45.442
Totally understand.
Just between the two of us.

1442
01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:46.573
Great.

1443
01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:47.879
I'll call you later. Liam.

1444
01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:49.054
Thanks.

1445
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.406
Emma?

1446
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.278
Hey. great to see you again.

1447
01:09:55.452 --> 01:09:57.976
Yeah. You too. Natalie.

1448
01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:01.153
So. what were you
and Liam discussing?

1449
01:10:01.327 --> 01:10:03.503
Just some last-minute
flower plans.

1450
01:10:03.677 --> 01:10:05.853
Oh. Cool.

1451
01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:07.942
I gotta go make those bouquets.

1452
01:10:08.116 --> 01:10:09.509
I'll see you tomorrow
at the wedding.

1453
01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.685
Yeah. I'll see you then.

1454
01:10:13.121 --> 01:10:14.253
Bye.

1455
01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:16.777
Hey. I thought you were...

1456
01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.997
I finished early. so I just
wanted to give you this.

1457
01:10:19.171 --> 01:10:21.521
Thanks. I'm sure
it looks great.

1458
01:10:21.695 --> 01:10:23.131
You'll look great in it.

1459
01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:24.872
You do too.

1460
01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:26.309
In a suit?

1461
01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:32.053
I meant. in your dress.
In your dress.

1462
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.881
Well. I think we're all set.

1463
01:10:34.055 --> 01:10:36.014
I triple-checked our list
and it's complete.

1464
01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:40.018
Back to being just Best Man
and Maid of Honor.

1465
01:10:40.192 --> 01:10:42.368
And corporate events.

1466
01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:47.939
So. you're still moving?
You took the job?

1467
01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:51.986
It's just really hard to turn
down. you know?

1468
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.075
Right. Right.

1469
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.514
So. are you still going
solo tomorrow?

1470
01:10:57.688 --> 01:10:59.907
Nope. He's found a plus one.

1471
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:01.126
Oh.

1472
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.825
I. who is it?

1473
01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.523
It's a surprise.

1474
01:11:06.697 --> 01:11:08.394
Let's just say that
he's found someone

1475
01:11:08.568 --> 01:11:11.354
that really gives him
the spark.

1476
01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:16.881
You know. tomorrow's
a big day for everyone.

1477
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.448
so I think I'm gonna head out.

1478
01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:20.058
You sure?

1479
01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:23.975
Yeah. Wanna get eight hours
of beauty sleep.

1480
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:26.020
Are you ok?

1481
01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:28.371
Totally. Never better.

1482
01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:30.373
I'll see you tomorrow.

1483
01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:39.686
Good night... Emma.

1484
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.354
Hi. Mom.

1485
01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:58.096
Do you have time to make
those Italian wedding cookies?

1486
01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:13.329
I know when my daughter
has something on her mind.

1487
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:16.288
I'm not sure it's just
one thing.

1488
01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:20.858
Well. you start talking
and I'll listen.

1489
01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:22.990
Is it about work?

1490
01:12:23.164 --> 01:12:24.905
That's definitely part of it.

1491
01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:26.254
Mm-hm.

1492
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.126
I got offered a promotion.

1493
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.607
Emma. that's fantastic!

1494
01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:33.044
Why aren't you jumping for joy?

1495
01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:36.830
Because the job is in Seattle.

1496
01:12:37.004 --> 01:12:39.616
Oh. I see.

1497
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:43.054
Well. honey.
Seattle's not that far.

1498
01:12:43.228 --> 01:12:45.622
It's not just
about the distance.

1499
01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:47.493
It's about the job itself.
too.

1500
01:12:47.667 --> 01:12:50.931
I... I can't decide
if I want it.

1501
01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:53.456
Have you done your
pros and cons list?

1502
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:55.414
About thirty of them.

1503
01:12:57.155 --> 01:13:00.506
Then what makes you happiest?

1504
01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.988
Because that's what's
most important.

1505
01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:06.164
I don't know.

1506
01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:10.255
Maybe think about it like this.

1507
01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:14.868
If you stay. what do you have
to lose in Seattle?

1508
01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:19.090
And if you go. what do you have
to lose here?

1509
01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:25.575
I tell you one thing.
you might miss my baking.

1510
01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:31.494
because I bet no one in Seattle
makes cookies like these.

1511
01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:38.892
Mm.

1512
01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:42.461

Emma. it's exquisite.

1515
01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:01.915
I feel like one of those brides
in a magazine.

1516
01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:03.134
You will be.

1517
01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:04.831

1518
01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:06.920

of Bride Monthly.

If you don't become
a wedding planner. I swear-

Hey... Today is your day.

1521
01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:14.362
That doesn't mean
you can't have fun.

1522
01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:16.364
Planning on dancing with Liam?

1523
01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:18.584
He brought a date for that.

1524
01:14:18.758 --> 01:14:20.020
What?

1525
01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:24.068
I'm so sorry. Emma.
I had no idea.

1526
01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:25.504
It's not a big deal.

1527
01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:27.550
We had a job to do
and we did it.

1528
01:14:27.724 --> 01:14:28.986
End of story.

1529
01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.379
Now onto whatever's next.

1530
01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:33.512
And what is next for you?

1531
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.907
Ladies. 10 minutes!

1532
01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:38.778
That's our cue.

1533
01:14:38.952 --> 01:14:41.215
Let me do one last run-through
and then we're ready.

1534
01:14:43.783 --> 01:14:47.004
Remind me why I'm having
to help you get ready?

1535
01:14:47.178 --> 01:14:49.049
I never learned how
to fix a tie.

1536
01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:50.877
Weren't you wearing one
to my engagement party?

1537
01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:52.400
Clip on.

1538
01:14:54.228 --> 01:14:56.274
Which reminds me. I have
something to give you.

1539
01:14:59.756 --> 01:15:01.148
Cufflinks.

Bike chain link.

Clever.

1542
01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:09.635
It's the least I can do
as best man.

1543
01:15:09.809 --> 01:15:12.203
Hey. you've gone above and
beyond in that department. man.

1544
01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:14.292
Thanks for everything. Liam.

1545
01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:21.299
I wish you the happiness.
You both deserve the best.

1546

Brett told me that you were
the wedding planner

1553

and I had to say that you did
a remarkable job.

1554

Actually I was more of
a stand...

1555

Um. yes. Thank you.

1556

Oh. Jamal. I'm flattered.
but...

1559

Oh. because my sister's
getting married next year

1560
01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:02.862
and this is exactly the kind of
vision she's looking for.

Oh. Jamal. I'm so sorry.
this is my boss.

Not a problem.

01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:23.535
I got the plans back
from the client

1570
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:25.232
and just wanted
to let you know

1571
01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:27.147
that they've changed them
quite a bit.

1572
01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:28.758
How much?

1573
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.934
The colors are back
to white and grey.

1574
01:16:31.108 --> 01:16:33.850
there's no big dessert table
and...

1575
01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:34.981
No dance floor?

1576
01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:36.722
I'm sorry. Emma.

1577
01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:37.854
But with the promotion
you wouldn't be dealing

1578
01:16:38.028 --> 01:16:40.247
with trivial details.

1579
01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:42.423
So what do you think?

1580
01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.947
No.

1581
01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:47.559
I. I can't take the promotion.

1582
01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:50.344
Danielle. thank you so much
for this opportunity. but I...

Say no more.

really be missing out.

Ok. we are all set.

1591
01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:20.592
