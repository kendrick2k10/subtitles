3
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:16.081
2 million fake bank accounts

4
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.051
under customers' names
without their knowledge.

5
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.613
At one time I had.
looking at it.

6
00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:23.187
counting it.
I had 15 accounts at once.

7
00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:24.716
The guy that was doing
the camera work today

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:27.257
where I am at the Capitol
was one of those customers

9
00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.787
that got an unauthorized.
unwarranted account.

10
00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.558
We hear it all over the place.

11
00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:34.198
Now. thousands of employees
have been fired.

12
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.793
and customers are left wondering

13
00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:37.630
if they're victims.

14
00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.797
The unauthorized opening
of accounts in your name

15
00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:41.799
may be by using fraudulent
email addresses or pins

16
00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:43.801
is just shocking conduct.
and absolutely

17
00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:45.407
should not be tolerated.

18
00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.079
I don't even know
when it's gonna get going.

19
00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.411
Well. there's 10.
there's 15. there's 5.

20
00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.809
and I didn't authorize
any of this.

21
00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:53.712
Ma'am. I'm so sorry.
we're short staffed

22
00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:55.747
-on Saturdays.
-I need my check

23
00:00:55.782 --> 00:00:57.683
deposited by today.

24
00:00:57.718 --> 00:01:01.126
If I could just maybe get
a deposit slip really quickly.

25
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.424
So. you haven't resigned.

26
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:03.821
you haven't returned
a single nickel

27
00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:06.527
of your personal earnings.
you haven't fired

28
00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:08.496
a single senior executive.

29
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:09.794
Yeah. I can take care
of that for you.

30
00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.204
It will be much quicker
if you come inside.

31
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.305
-Thank you.
-Instead. evidently

32
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.439
your definition of "accountable"

33
00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:20.343
is to push the blame
to your low-level employees

34
00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:22.708
who don't have the money
for a fancy PR firm

35
00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:24.809
to defend themselves.

36
00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:33.653
So. if I get me
one of them new smartphones.

37
00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:35.292
I can do all this from home?

38
00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:40.627
But. you squeezed your employees
to the breaking point.

39
00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:43.135
so they would cheat customers.

40
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.336
and you could drive up
the value of your stock.

41
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.767
and put hundreds
of millions of dollars

42
00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.373
in your own pocket.

43
00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:52.738
Last time. I think
it was your manager.

44
00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:56.379
mentioned that I was in
for a small business loan.

45
00:01:56.414 --> 00:01:58.216
Could we get that put together?

46
00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:04.354
Frank. are you there?

47
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.521
Yeah. just--just a second.

48
00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.756
You accepted. all along.

49
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:14.562
as this fraud built up.
this massive fraud.

50
00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:16.630
I'm--I'm really sorry
about this.

51
00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:18.731
Just give me one second.

52
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:22.570
In 2008.

53
00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:25.441
Wall Street promised change.

54
00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:28.609
but it looks like
it is business as usual.

55
00:02:28.644 --> 00:02:31.612
A giant bank
cheats the little guys.

56
00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:34.516
and the executives
line their own pockets.

57
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.837
No. no. no. no. no. no. okay.
okay. don't shoot. don't shoot.

58
00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:33.476
-don't shoot.
-Don't touch the button

59
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:34.675
-or we'll shoot.
-Okay. I'm not.

60
00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:40.252
Everyone else
on your stomachs now!

61
00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:43.321
Don't touch your phones.
purses. nothing!

62
00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.752
Let me see your hands.
make sure I can see 'em!

63
00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:47.358
And you.
what are you still doing?

64
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.558
-Get on the floor.
-Fuck you. she's pregnant.

65
00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:51.461
On her side then. now!

66
00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:55.333
Nobody has to get hurt.
just do what I say!

67
00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.577
What do you think they want?
There can't be much here.

68
00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.450
Oh. my God. Jesus.

69
00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:19.555
121. come in. 121.

70
00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:32.799
Where's Frank?

71
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.474
Enough!

72
00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.378
Where's your phone?

73
00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.907
Okay.

74
00:04:41.942 --> 00:04:44.547
121. what's your 20?

75
00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.519
Really? Door.

76
00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:56.559
You're going to
respond to dispatch.

77
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.833
Not a word off.

78
00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:11.343
Ready?

79
00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:13.609
Dispatch. this is 121.
we have a--

80
00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:18.746
I said. "Not a word."

81
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:22.519
I was just calling it in.

82
00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:24.488
Dispatch. this is 121.

83
00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:27.557
All secure.
just routine maintenance.

84
00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:41.736
I don't have a phone.

85
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:44.640
He says he doesn't have one.

86
00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:46.004
It's true. it's true. he told--

87
00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.776
Shut up.

88
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:50.448
I don't believe him.

89
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.621
Are you having fun back there?

90
00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:00.689
Shut up.

91
00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:06.090
Okay. that's enough.

92
00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:09.632
-That's enough.
-What the fuck are you doing?

93
00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.766
I'm not doing it like this.

94
00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:15.000
Okay. we need
those last two phones.

95
00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:19.444
You cover the front. all right?

96
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.712
Listen. I can handle this.

97
00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:25.076
The signal's down anyways.

98
00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.456
I'm calling an audible.

99
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.791
Don't make me regret this.

100
00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.036
I apologize
if he was a little rough.

101
00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:55.942
Is it really possible that
somebody this day and age

102
00:06:55.977 --> 00:06:58.010
-doesn't have a cellphone?
-You're looking at him.

103
00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:02.784
I think he just wants
to make sure that

104
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.852
-you don't have a gun.
-Well. I don't.

105
00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.991
I mean. you're a painter?

106
00:07:14.897 --> 00:07:17.865
You could probably scrape by
on what. 40. 50.000 a year?

107
00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:22.969
I'm not judging you.

108
00:07:25.072 --> 00:07:26.808
If you give me an hour.
I'll give you more money

109
00:07:26.843 --> 00:07:28.975
than you've seen in a lifetime.

110
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.648
and it's
100-percent untraceable.

111
00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:33.111
Yeah. right.

112
00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:42.527
I'm not joking.

113
00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:48.060
All of you are victims
of the most corrupt bank

114
00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:50.700
in history.
and today is your bailout.

115
00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:53.802
You don't have to like
what happens here today.

116
00:07:53.837 --> 00:07:55.738
but nobody has to
get hurt either.

117
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.676
Can you pat him down again?

118
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:01.172
Oh. come on.

119
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.618
I gave you the opportunity. sir.
he's just. uh--

120
00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.884
he's just trying
to keep everyone safe.

121
00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:13.723
Thought you could hide that?

122
00:08:16.156 --> 00:08:18.662
Sir.

123
00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.192
I do hope you cooperate with me
going forward. all right?

124
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.932
I wanna make sure everybody
gets out of here alive today.

125
00:08:24.967 --> 00:08:26.296
okay?

126
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.938
And you.

127
00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:32.775
there's no need
to cover for him.

128
00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.900
Charger.

129
00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:17.820
Okay. everything's as planned.

130
00:09:17.855 --> 00:09:19.085
we just need to find
the last phone.

131
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.691
and then we can get out of here.

132
00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.296
The other missing phone
is yours?

133
00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.333
Okay.

134
00:09:38.073 --> 00:09:40.942
What the fuck are you doing?

135
00:09:40.977 --> 00:09:42.779
The longer we're in this lobby.

136
00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:44.913
the more difficult
this is going to be.

137
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:48.246
I know you're jacked up
right now. but it's not helping.

138
00:09:48.281 --> 00:09:50.149
I need you to
calm the fuck down.

139
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:53.691
Please.

140
00:09:55.893 --> 00:09:57.959
Okay.

141
00:10:00.194 --> 00:10:03.030
-Is the phone in your car?
-I--I think so.

142
00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:04.735
Okay. let's go. come on.

143
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.297
Hurry it the fuck up.
if we're still here

144
00:10:06.332 --> 00:10:08.739
in 10 minutes. I'm calling it.

145
00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:19.684
-Yeah?
-Watch future dad over there.

146
00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:22.181
Yeah. no fucking kidding.

147
00:10:22.216 --> 00:10:24.755
All right.
we're opening the door.

148
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.187
Nobody say a goddamn thing.

149
00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:29.925
Come on.

150
00:10:34.866 --> 00:10:36.393
All right.

151
00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.670
We're gonna get through this.
you're doing just fine.

152
00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:46.205
Hey.

153
00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:51.045
If something goes down.
can I rely on you?

154
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.050
Knock it off.
we already told you.

155
00:10:56.085 --> 00:10:57.722
there's no need for that.

156
00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:00.318
Where's the manager?

157
00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:01.792
Shit.

158
00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:07.424
Hey. man. hey.
you guys closed already?

159
00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:11.065
Yes. sir. how can I help you?

160
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.001
Well. the ATM isn't closed.
though. right?

161
00:11:13.036 --> 00:11:14.937
No. ATM never closes.

162
00:11:30.383 --> 00:11:32.284
Okay.

163
00:11:35.223 --> 00:11:37.157
Excuse me.

164
00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:38.961
Let's see that phone. phone.

165
00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.943
Why's he sending the driver away
if he's just here for cash?

166
00:11:53.978 --> 00:11:56.011
Tell him we're closed.

167
00:11:56.046 --> 00:11:58.783
I did.

168
00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.312
And he's already seen my face.

169
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.056
Okay.

170
00:12:08.091 --> 00:12:11.125
Okay. I'll take care of it.

171
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.391
-Excuse me. sir.
-All right. you know the drill?

172
00:12:13.426 --> 00:12:16.130
Yeah. I got it. don't worry.

173
00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:19.837
-How can I help you?
-Uh. the ATM's down.

174
00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:21.872
-The ATM is down?
-Yeah. yeah. you need. like.

175
00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.368
the weight of a car.
or something like that.

176
00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:26.272
It's like a sensor or something.

177
00:12:26.307 --> 00:12:29.077
Well. I know that there is
a branch down the road

178
00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:31.145
that has a walk-up ATM.

179
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.412
I mean. isn't there
an ATM in there. right?

180
00:12:34.447 --> 00:12:36.216
Yes. sir. but I'm sorry.
we just closed

181
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.888
-a few minutes ago.
-Come on. man.

182
00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.186
I just need. like. 20 bucks.

183
00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:45.093
You're right. I'm sorry.

184
00:12:45.128 --> 00:12:46.523
Come on in.

185
00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:54.300
Well. fuck.

186
00:13:29.007 --> 00:13:30.974
All right.
let's get the camera going.

187
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:33.075
You aren't giving me
a whole lot of options here.

188
00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:37.442
Is that a threat?

189
00:13:37.477 --> 00:13:40.280
-You said this wasn't personal.
-It's not.

190
00:13:40.315 --> 00:13:42.051
Then. you don't need
to have your face

191
00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:43.613
-on the camera like that.
-Listen. we're already here.

192
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:46.583
Can we please finish
what we came to do?

193
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:50.862
Fine. but if you go off book
one more time.

194
00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:54.228
I will pin this whole
goddamn thing on you.

195
00:14:10.378 --> 00:14:12.983
One of y'all gonna
do something brave?

196
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.307
What's your name?

197
00:14:40.342 --> 00:14:42.012
Megan.

198
00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:45.675
Listen. everything--

199
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.281
everything's gonna be fine.

200
00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.350
Okay?

201
00:14:50.385 --> 00:14:52.484
Yeah. you don't need
to worry about them.

202
00:14:57.656 --> 00:14:59.293
I think we could take 'em.

203
00:14:59.328 --> 00:15:02.164
Can you not threaten
the dude with the gun?

204
00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:03.935
Enough!

205
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:07.004
Well. where's the manager?

206
00:15:09.371 --> 00:15:11.701
I assure you that
the manager is fine.

207
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.672
Is this your first panic attack?

208
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:18.510
-Can you back off for just--?
-My meds are in my bag.

209
00:15:24.518 --> 00:15:27.519
Okay. when's the last time
you took one?

210
00:15:27.554 --> 00:15:30.555
Um. an hour ago.

211
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.030
or it was 20 minutes.

212
00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.329
I don't remember.

213
00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:38.431
There's paper bags
in the break room.

214
00:15:40.435 --> 00:15:43.304
Okay. can you take her
to go get that. please?

215
00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:45.141
Really?

216
00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:47.143
Is that necessary?

217
00:15:47.178 --> 00:15:49.508
Ideally I think we'd all like
Megan to be able to breathe.

218
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.984
And while you're gone.
please consider

219
00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:55.382
who you're gonna contact.

220
00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:57.516
What?

221
00:15:57.551 --> 00:15:59.287
Constant contact. right?

222
00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:02.686
Everybody's got one.
somebody that's awaiting

223
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:05.722
some meme response. an email.
a text. a phone call. whatever.

224
00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:07.526
Somebody like that. okay?

225
00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:09.759
I don't want anybody wondering
where we're at right now.

226
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.499
Who's phone is this?

227
00:16:13.534 --> 00:16:15.567
Uh. that'd be me.

228
00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:39.492
-Frank.
-Keep your voice down.

229
00:16:49.768 --> 00:16:52.703
You guys have a PowerPoint
on how to get away with a heist?

230
00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:55.409
Something like that.

231
00:16:55.444 --> 00:16:57.048
But. we're not the ones
getting away with it.

232
00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:03.582
How did he get a lighter?

233
00:17:03.617 --> 00:17:05.815
So far the only person
these guys have robbed is me

234
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.455
of a smoke break.

235
00:17:12.758 --> 00:17:15.594
I'm not just
saying it to say it.

236
00:17:15.629 --> 00:17:17.629
I'm gonna need a smoke.

237
00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:23.239
This political?

238
00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:27.309
What isn't these days?

239
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:32.248
-Don't point that thing at me.
-I--

240
00:17:32.283 --> 00:17:34.316
I heard the shot
in the back. what?

241
00:17:34.351 --> 00:17:35.548
This is not
what it looks like. Allison.

242
00:17:35.583 --> 00:17:37.253
-Well then. what is it?
-They're bullets.

243
00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:39.189
They're all blanks.

244
00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:43.688
What?

245
00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:52.235
So. uh. who should we contact?

246
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.138
Uh. I don't know.

247
00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.535
my roommates.

248
00:17:57.704 --> 00:18:00.309
Just like that.
you expect us to comply?

249
00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:01.574
No. you're not
complying with me.

250
00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:03.444
you're complying with him.

251
00:18:05.382 --> 00:18:08.581
-Should we text them?
-No. no. Morse code.

252
00:18:08.616 --> 00:18:11.485
-Of course text.
-What's your fucking game?

253
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.619
-Hey!
-Hey. uh--

254
00:18:13.654 --> 00:18:15.588
No. I--I don't--

255
00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:17.293
Does it look like
I'm playing with you?

256
00:18:17.328 --> 00:18:19.427
No. what?

257
00:18:19.462 --> 00:18:22.364
You--you wanted me
to think you were dead?

258
00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:24.597
He's going to
explain everything.

259
00:18:27.668 --> 00:18:29.800
Is this. like. a--
a hidden camera show

260
00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:31.802
-or something?
-No. it isn't.

261
00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:33.375
-Frank. just--
-You are going to have to

262
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.805
-follow my lead.
-Tell me what is going on.

263
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.874
If I had the time.
I would explain everything.

264
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.217
Look. would I ever
put you in danger?

265
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:45.585
You message on
a third-party app. right?

266
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.423
-Encrypted?
-Yeah.

267
00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:49.853
Smart man.

268
00:18:49.888 --> 00:18:51.723
What should we tell them?

269
00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:59.368
Um. I don't know. how about.

270
00:18:59.403 --> 00:19:02.899
"Got held up. be home soon"?

271
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.374
Cute one.

272
00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:06.672
Are they expecting you?

273
00:19:08.577 --> 00:19:10.676
Yeah. we usually go out
on Saturday nights.

274
00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:11.908
Particular time?

275
00:19:15.683 --> 00:19:18.552
You know.
just whenever we all get home.

276
00:19:18.587 --> 00:19:21.456
Which is?

277
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:23.557
It can vary.

278
00:19:23.592 --> 00:19:25.196
Okay.

279
00:19:35.538 --> 00:19:37.604
Where'd you even get that thing?

280
00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:40.805
Collin isn't always around
when I'm closing.

281
00:19:42.677 --> 00:19:44.776
-Ready?
-Wait.

282
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:47.911
Was--was this always a part
of the plan. you telling me?

283
00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:49.715
I don't even know anymore.
he wasn't supposed to

284
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.453
-take his mask off.
-But. he wants you

285
00:19:51.488 --> 00:19:53.950
to close down the bank?

286
00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.821
Let me suggest
closing down the bank.

287
00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:58.988
Why would he do that?

288
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:00.726
Do you totally trust them?

289
00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:14.608
So.

290
00:20:14.643 --> 00:20:17.875
that'll be Eric. Joe.

291
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.745
and TJ that we're texting?

292
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.714
How'd you--?

293
00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:24.288
I need to close down the bank.

294
00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.619
if you don't want
the security company

295
00:20:25.654 --> 00:20:28.259
-calling again.
-Allison.

296
00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:30.327
If you don't want this
turning into a shootout.

297
00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.625
Now that's a really good idea.

298
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.561
I should've
thought of that myself.

299
00:20:33.596 --> 00:20:35.662
Can you do my deposit for me?

300
00:20:35.697 --> 00:20:37.631
Really. can we just
let them have what they want

301
00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:39.402
so we can get out of here?

302
00:20:39.437 --> 00:20:40.799
That's exactly right.
we need to make sure

303
00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:42.702
that nobody's expecting us.

304
00:20:42.737 --> 00:20:44.770
Why do you need
to deposit that check?

305
00:20:44.805 --> 00:20:46.640
Because my rent's due
by tomorrow.

306
00:20:46.675 --> 00:20:48.708
I think your landlord's
gonna understand.

307
00:20:48.743 --> 00:20:51.348
No. we are depositing
that check.

308
00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.549
just like we had
to text your roommates.

309
00:20:57.983 --> 00:20:59.488
And you're gonna keep
a real close eye on

310
00:20:59.523 --> 00:21:01.589
Ms. Manford for me. right?

311
00:21:04.088 --> 00:21:06.363
Good.

312
00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.826
Who's next?

313
00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:13.029
Someone's taken a branch.

314
00:21:15.836 --> 00:21:17.605
What do you mean
"taken a branch"?

315
00:21:20.577 --> 00:21:23.413
The link to this footage
was sent to me directly.

316
00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.909
No sign of where
it's coming from.

317
00:21:26.979 --> 00:21:28.682
They don't even
have the sound on.

318
00:21:28.717 --> 00:21:30.585
Just seems like they want me
to know that they're in.

319
00:21:32.622 --> 00:21:34.919
So. do we know for certain
this is live?

320
00:21:34.954 --> 00:21:36.789
Do we have the luxury
of doubting it?

321
00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.668
We're not gonna
negotiate with terrorists.

322
00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:51.342
That's just it. they haven't
sent me any demands.

323
00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:53.542
That's why I didn't
send you the link.

324
00:21:53.577 --> 00:21:55.379
At this point.

325
00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.809
you have plausible deniability.

326
00:21:59.814 --> 00:22:01.880
All right. then we'll just--

327
00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:09.690
Holy shit.

328
00:22:23.904 --> 00:22:26.740
There's no one to contact.
otherwise we'd do it.

329
00:22:40.888 --> 00:22:42.954
Is this a joke to you?

330
00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:45.022
Can you tell them to get
the fucking gun off of her?

331
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.432
Yes. of course.

332
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.505
I'm sorry. I--

333
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.805
He's trying to
move this along. okay?

334
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.642
I already told you. we were
going home and staying there

335
00:23:00.677 --> 00:23:02.809
the rest of the afternoon.
no one was expecting us.

336
00:23:02.844 --> 00:23:06.142
Right. but you're not home now.

337
00:23:06.177 --> 00:23:09.079
You're here. so.

338
00:23:09.114 --> 00:23:10.652
Just do what he wants.

339
00:23:13.019 --> 00:23:16.757
Victoria's bound to
come over for something.

340
00:23:16.792 --> 00:23:18.627
Your sister?

341
00:23:18.662 --> 00:23:19.958
No. neighbor.

342
00:23:22.765 --> 00:23:24.732
Did you lock the back door
on your way out?

343
00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:28.164
Yeah.

344
00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:32.641
Why don't we call Victoria
and ask her to check?

345
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.875
That's a great idea.

346
00:23:57.866 --> 00:24:00.570
Hi. Victoria. it's Maria.

347
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:02.539
Yeah. yeah. yes. no problem.

348
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.899
Yes. yes.

349
00:24:32.934 --> 00:24:34.868
No problem.

350
00:24:37.169 --> 00:24:40.269
Uh. we decided
to go to the mall.

351
00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:41.974
Hello?

352
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.584
Would you mind seeing
if we locked the back door?

353
00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.047
How can I help you?

354
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:54.690
Yeah. thank you.

355
00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:56.087
That--that would be great.

356
00:24:56.122 --> 00:24:58.122
Yeah. see you. bye.

357
00:25:22.951 --> 00:25:24.918
Yeah.

358
00:25:24.953 --> 00:25:27.283
We should be back up
and closed down

359
00:25:27.318 --> 00:25:29.560
for the evening.

360
00:25:29.595 --> 00:25:30.957
You got that on your end?

361
00:26:11.868 --> 00:26:13.736
Oh. God.

362
00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:16.101
-Ah. Frank. you scared--
-Frank?

363
00:26:16.136 --> 00:26:18.741
No. no. no. no. no. no.

364
00:26:18.776 --> 00:26:21.744
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

365
00:26:24.276 --> 00:26:25.847
Sure.

366
00:26:25.882 --> 00:26:27.343
We need anything else?

367
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.755
Okay. sounds good.

368
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.087
I'll swing by and see you soon.

369
00:26:35.122 --> 00:26:37.023
Bye-bye.

370
00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:38.695
Good.

371
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.257
And I suggest that
you actually stop at the store

372
00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:43.326
on the way home just to
make everything appear normal.

373
00:26:47.233 --> 00:26:48.705
You were in on this.

374
00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:53.138
Didn't wanna call
your bestie Frank. huh?

375
00:26:53.173 --> 00:26:55.712
What are you doing?

376
00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.714
What are you doing. Jane?

377
00:26:59.982 --> 00:27:02.785
Come--come on. Frank.
enough is enough. all right.

378
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.149
Oh. she's right. Frank.

379
00:27:06.857 --> 00:27:09.660
I told you not to wear one
to begin with.

380
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:19.670
-What exactly is this shit?
-All right. calm down.

381
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:28.272
So. these others at the table.

382
00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:30.274
they seem to know this guy.

383
00:27:32.113 --> 00:27:35.114
If I were to guess.
I'd have to say that she's--

384
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:38.689
she's an employee.

385
00:27:38.724 --> 00:27:41.153
Everybody else just looks
dressed like a customer.

386
00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:46.125
So. perhaps he's
an employee as well.

387
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.765
Do you recognize him?

388
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.394
We have over 6.000 branches.

389
00:27:53.134 --> 00:27:54.837
I always knew this bank
was stealing from me.

390
00:27:54.872 --> 00:27:56.333
but goddamn.

391
00:27:59.404 --> 00:28:01.404
The quicker everyone
clears their alibi.

392
00:28:01.439 --> 00:28:03.472
the quicker we can explain.

393
00:28:03.507 --> 00:28:05.749
Explain why you're
taking your own bank hostage?

394
00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.212
Why don't you
show us how it's done?

395
00:28:10.415 --> 00:28:12.250
Not a bad idea.

396
00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:16.452
Okay.

397
00:28:16.487 --> 00:28:18.960
All right.

398
00:28:18.995 --> 00:28:20.489
I'll text Greg.

399
00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:22.898
We play basketball
on Saturdays now and again.

400
00:28:22.933 --> 00:28:24.735
-What about your wife?
-Do you see a ring

401
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.001
-on his finger?
-I never married.

402
00:28:27.036 --> 00:28:28.365
Nah.

403
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.005
wasn't legal
till a couple years ago.

404
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.007
Now. what does that
have to do with anything?

405
00:28:33.042 --> 00:28:34.338
It doesn't.

406
00:28:36.144 --> 00:28:39.013
Fair enough.

407
00:28:39.048 --> 00:28:41.851
Uh-uh.

408
00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.182
We'll type it for you.

409
00:29:02.434 --> 00:29:05.402
Okay. all right. all right.
calm down. calm down.

410
00:29:05.437 --> 00:29:08.339
We need to calm down
so we can all get one. right?

411
00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:12.178
Go for Senator McHenry.

412
00:29:14.116 --> 00:29:15.511
Okay. getting her now.

413
00:29:23.257 --> 00:29:25.356
Ma'am. you have a phone call.

414
00:29:25.391 --> 00:29:27.864
Ugh. well.

415
00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:31.131
um. unfortunately
I have to go back to work.

416
00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:33.397
There's no rest
for civil service.

417
00:29:33.432 --> 00:29:35.135
But.

418
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.467
it is Ms. Starla's birthday.

419
00:29:37.502 --> 00:29:40.503
so she is gonna be the one
to hand out the party favors.

420
00:29:40.538 --> 00:29:42.340
Thank you.
happy birthday. sweetheart.

421
00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:44.012
Here you go. babe.

422
00:29:46.577 --> 00:29:48.082
It's Daniels.

423
00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:58.862
A branch has been breached.

424
00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.457
Jesus.

425
00:30:00.492 --> 00:30:03.097
You know I don't need to know
about those things.

426
00:30:16.442 --> 00:30:18.376
-Get me a secure line.
-Already on it.

427
00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:24.085
That plaque.

428
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.384
-That one?
-Right there.

429
00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:29.123
We rolled that out
a couple of months back.

430
00:30:29.158 --> 00:30:31.928
Morale booster.

431
00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:35.459
A dozen or so branches
that received them.

432
00:30:35.494 --> 00:30:37.329
I'll get that list. sir.

433
00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:45.436
Yes. sir.

434
00:30:45.471 --> 00:30:48.406
Just wanted you to know that
that composite you wanted

435
00:30:48.441 --> 00:30:51.046
is in stock.

436
00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:52.883
Yep.

437
00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:56.480
Should be able to get started
first thing Monday morning.

438
00:30:56.515 --> 00:30:58.053
Yep.

439
00:30:58.088 --> 00:30:59.384
All right.

440
00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:01.419
You have a good night now.

441
00:31:01.454 --> 00:31:02.651
Talk to you soon.

442
00:31:04.556 --> 00:31:06.061
There.

443
00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:10.131
Can I have a cigarette now?

444
00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:11.429
Who's this. Willy?

445
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:15.598
That's my wife.

446
00:31:18.438 --> 00:31:21.109
That's my daughter's page.
right?

447
00:31:21.144 --> 00:31:23.947
Is your daughter Robin Tucker?

448
00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:27.148
I want you to take a look at
when that was posted.

449
00:31:27.183 --> 00:31:29.612
That's the last photo of my wife

450
00:31:29.647 --> 00:31:31.317
before she started chemo.

451
00:31:33.222 --> 00:31:35.552
Yeah. but--but your ring.

452
00:31:35.587 --> 00:31:38.390
What. I don't wanna
doubt the guy either.

453
00:31:38.425 --> 00:31:40.029
I don't know. do we want
Mrs. Spitz to come

454
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.965
looking for him?

455
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.066
You know. with these guys?

456
00:31:48.237 --> 00:31:50.435
I can't believe I'm saying this.

457
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.701
Verify it.

458
00:31:52.736 --> 00:31:55.440
Look it up.

459
00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:07.386
Unfortunately it looks like
it's more like 25 locations

460
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:09.388
-that received the plaques.
-Let me guess. we hit up

461
00:32:09.423 --> 00:32:11.621
every region. huh?

462
00:32:11.656 --> 00:32:13.491
On a map it would
look like a carpet bombing.

463
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:18.232
Morale.

464
00:32:21.237 --> 00:32:23.534
"Willy. her husband of 39 years.

465
00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:25.569
a career painter and landscaper.

466
00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:28.440
was the love of her life.

467
00:32:28.475 --> 00:32:30.376
When she got sick.
he built a park bench

468
00:32:30.411 --> 00:32:33.313
for Johnson Park.
where they first met.

469
00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:35.117
Says he'll continue
to go there every day

470
00:32:35.152 --> 00:32:37.746
until he sees Sheryl again.

471
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:41.090
Sheryl is survived
by her husband.

472
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:43.290
-and daughter Robin."
-That's enough.

473
00:32:46.625 --> 00:32:50.297
She took care of
all the banking stuff.

474
00:32:50.332 --> 00:32:52.497
She's the whole reason
I was even here today.

475
00:32:54.633 --> 00:32:57.073
Would your daughter be expecting
to see you this afternoon?

476
00:33:00.342 --> 00:33:02.177
We haven't talked in a while.

477
00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:24.133
Collin. why don't you go next?

478
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.668
Sure.

479
00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:34.176
I'll call my wife.

480
00:33:34.211 --> 00:33:36.178
Tell her I'm staying late.

481
00:33:36.213 --> 00:33:37.707
I've already told
the security company

482
00:33:37.742 --> 00:33:39.577
that we're locked up
for the night.

483
00:33:39.612 --> 00:33:42.184
Do you ever stop for a beer
on the way home?

484
00:33:42.219 --> 00:33:44.186
-Not even to watch the game?
-No.

485
00:33:44.221 --> 00:33:46.683
She wouldn't believe that.

486
00:33:46.718 --> 00:33:50.159
You could get a jacket.

487
00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:53.096
a new jacket for your daughter.

488
00:33:56.497 --> 00:33:57.760
Yeah. that'll work.

489
00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:01.764
-Okay. a call?
-Text.

490
00:34:07.442 --> 00:34:09.508
Let me type it.

491
00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:14.216
The dozen major
security companies

492
00:34:14.251 --> 00:34:17.450
that we partner with
all have subcontractors

493
00:34:17.485 --> 00:34:20.222
based in their area.

494
00:34:20.257 --> 00:34:22.422
But. clearly if
we haven't been notified.

495
00:34:22.457 --> 00:34:24.457
these guys have
smoke-screened them somehow.

496
00:34:24.492 --> 00:34:27.130
-so we--
-Don't propose anything

497
00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:30.760
that asserts we go public
with this information.

498
00:34:30.795 --> 00:34:32.861
That's why you were hired.

499
00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:35.633
to assure we don't
have to do that.

500
00:34:35.668 --> 00:34:37.173
Yes. sir.

501
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:41.111
You have his phone number.

502
00:34:41.146 --> 00:34:43.245
Give it to me and I'll find him.

503
00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.815
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

504
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.356
Look. we're gonna
do this together. okay?

505
00:34:55.391 --> 00:34:57.622
And your rent check
got deposited. right?

506
00:34:59.923 --> 00:35:01.890
Soon you're never gonna have to
worry about a rent check again.

507
00:35:01.925 --> 00:35:05.432
-so.
-Maybe I can call my landlord

508
00:35:05.467 --> 00:35:07.863
and tell him
my check was deposited.

509
00:35:07.898 --> 00:35:09.832
Okay. would that--
would that be normal?

510
00:35:09.867 --> 00:35:12.340
-What do you mean?
-Do you talk to your landlord?

511
00:35:12.375 --> 00:35:14.342
-Not really.
-Jesus Christ.

512
00:35:14.377 --> 00:35:16.872
-just do it for her.
-Will you please stop?

513
00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:18.313
-I'm trying.
-All right.

514
00:35:18.348 --> 00:35:20.282
who do you talk to every day?

515
00:35:20.317 --> 00:35:23.318
-My mom.
-Have you spoken with her today?

516
00:35:23.353 --> 00:35:25.452
She reminded me this morning
about my rent.

517
00:35:25.487 --> 00:35:28.587
Okay. why don't we call her
and let her know it's done?

518
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.657
She's gonna know
something's wrong.

519
00:35:32.692 --> 00:35:34.593
-Why?
-Because she'll hear it

520
00:35:34.628 --> 00:35:38.465
-in my voice.
-Why don't we text her?

521
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.599
Do you think that will work?

522
00:35:40.634 --> 00:35:43.833
Maybe. she told me to call her
when I was done.

523
00:35:43.868 --> 00:35:45.868
Do you always call your mom
when she asks you to?

524
00:35:49.478 --> 00:35:52.314
Okay. so that's what we'll do.
we'll text her.

525
00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:56.516
See. it's gonna be fine.

526
00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:00.751
We're gonna get out of here.

527
00:36:04.922 --> 00:36:06.427
Add a smiley.

528
00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:20.672
Okay. if I do this.
then you promise

529
00:36:20.707 --> 00:36:22.872
-everyone gets out?
-Yes.

530
00:36:22.907 --> 00:36:24.808
It's almost over. Allison.

531
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:29.450
-Who do you wanna contact?
-My mother.

532
00:36:29.485 --> 00:36:31.782
Original.

533
00:36:33.819 --> 00:36:35.621
She's watching my kid.

534
00:36:35.656 --> 00:36:38.228
Is it typical you stay
this long closing up?

535
00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:40.593
No. we're normally gone
within an hour.

536
00:36:40.628 --> 00:36:42.298
Half hour.

537
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.432
Why hasn't she called you
wondering where you are?

538
00:36:44.467 --> 00:36:47.369
She has him till 8:00 tonight.

539
00:36:49.406 --> 00:36:51.703
Girl's night out?

540
00:36:51.738 --> 00:36:54.508
I was going to see a movie.

541
00:36:56.809 --> 00:36:58.743
Okay. well.

542
00:36:58.778 --> 00:37:01.284
let's call away--

543
00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.319
Actually. I usually FaceTime.

544
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:07.884
Hey. Mom.
when are you coming home?

545
00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:10.392
Soon. baby.
just be good for Nana

546
00:37:10.427 --> 00:37:11.723
and I'll be home soon. okay?

547
00:37:11.758 --> 00:37:14.627
Mom. I really want
you to come home.

548
00:37:14.662 --> 00:37:16.024
Micah. no sir.

549
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.336
Honey. I gotta go.

550
00:37:22.472 --> 00:37:24.670
Ally. are you all right?

551
00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:26.309
Maybe. I--

552
00:37:28.511 --> 00:37:31.006
I--I just don't like
when he acts like this.

553
00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:32.843
It reminds me of his father.

554
00:37:32.878 --> 00:37:35.747
Honey. don't worry. just--
just go on and have a good time.

555
00:37:35.782 --> 00:37:37.683
Everything is gonna
be okay. okay?

556
00:37:37.718 --> 00:37:39.289
We'll--we'll talk
to you real soon.

557
00:37:39.324 --> 00:37:41.621
Okay.

558
00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:43.326
Good save.

559
00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:47.957
You mind if I ask
about their dad?

560
00:37:53.668 --> 00:37:55.767
Divorced and out of state.

561
00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:02.037
All right.

562
00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:03.940
Well. listen. everybody.
that was the. um--

563
00:38:03.975 --> 00:38:05.909
that's the hard part. it's over.

564
00:38:07.946 --> 00:38:09.319
Frank. do you wanna
take somebody

565
00:38:09.354 --> 00:38:10.650
to get a pot of coffee going?

566
00:38:10.685 --> 00:38:12.014
Coffee?

567
00:38:12.049 --> 00:38:14.423
Are you kidding me right now?

568
00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:15.754
No. does anybody else
want any coffee?

569
00:38:15.789 --> 00:38:18.053
-Does that sound good?
-Cigarette?

570
00:38:18.088 --> 00:38:19.824
Sure.

571
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.697
Yeah.

572
00:38:24.732 --> 00:38:26.963
No. Allison. not you.

573
00:38:26.998 --> 00:38:28.800
Somebody else.

574
00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:37.677
Why don't you tell me
who you want me to take?

575
00:38:41.848 --> 00:38:43.551
Megan.

576
00:38:46.919 --> 00:38:50.118
Can you...not in here?

577
00:38:50.153 --> 00:38:51.856
What?

578
00:38:51.891 --> 00:38:53.462
She's pregnant.

579
00:38:57.127 --> 00:38:58.929
Why do you keep
your cellphone in your boot?

580
00:38:58.964 --> 00:39:01.998
'Cause I'd rather have cancer
in my ankle than in my head.

581
00:39:20.018 --> 00:39:22.788
How long have you known
about all of this?

582
00:39:28.697 --> 00:39:30.730
Look. I know that
nothing I can say

583
00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:33.095
is gonna make you
feel any better.

584
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.603
but I promise you
that in the next 15 minutes

585
00:39:35.638 --> 00:39:37.737
you're gonna look at
this whole thing differently.

586
00:39:48.651 --> 00:39:50.849
Well. congratulations. everyone.
from this point forward.

587
00:39:50.884 --> 00:39:54.050
your lives are
unabashedly your own.

588
00:39:54.085 --> 00:39:55.722
Are you all familiar with
the recent news coverage

589
00:39:55.757 --> 00:39:57.493
-on JD Wells?
-Are you talking about

590
00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.561
-the fraudulent credit cards?
-That would be the most recent.

591
00:39:59.596 --> 00:40:01.695
-yes.
-But. that was resolved. right?

592
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.730
Yes. it was.

593
00:40:03.765 --> 00:40:05.963
They paid a fine.
and our CEO stepped down.

594
00:40:05.998 --> 00:40:08.031
Well. that depends on
your definition of "resolved."

595
00:40:08.066 --> 00:40:09.769
"Your" CEO?

596
00:40:09.804 --> 00:40:11.903
You're technically just
a subcontractor. aren't you?

597
00:40:11.938 --> 00:40:13.905
-Same difference.
-So. this is revenge?

598
00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.006
The bank paid a fine.

599
00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:17.711
they paid their customers back.

600
00:40:17.746 --> 00:40:20.109
and the CEO stepped down. right?

601
00:40:20.144 --> 00:40:22.815
But. he stepped down with
$124 million severance.

602
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.114
Wait. severance. like.
he got paid to quit?

603
00:40:25.149 --> 00:40:27.523
That's exactly right.
and so did the other executive

604
00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:29.085
who headed up
the entire scandal.

605
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.759
-Was anyone imprisoned?
-Bankers don't go to prison.

606
00:40:32.794 --> 00:40:34.530
Just bank robbers.

607
00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.664
That's very wise. Mr. Spitz.

608
00:40:36.699 --> 00:40:38.699
-But. they paid a fine.
-The bank did.

609
00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:40.701
The executives didn't.
and what. it was. like.

610
00:40:40.736 --> 00:40:43.033
only $180 million.
or something like that?

611
00:40:43.068 --> 00:40:45.002
-Only $180 million?
-The bank's worth

612
00:40:45.037 --> 00:40:47.708
-at least a couple trillion.
-1.9.

613
00:40:47.743 --> 00:40:49.677
Where are you going with this?

614
00:40:49.712 --> 00:40:52.207
This is the bank's
internal server.

615
00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:54.814
The $2.6 million they stole
through fraudulent cards

616
00:40:54.849 --> 00:40:56.145
is nothing.

617
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.587
They took $36 billion
from taxpayers

618
00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.215
during the bailout.

619
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.723
Almost every bank
had that going on.

620
00:41:02.758 --> 00:41:04.956
He's right.
and they were all bailed out.

621
00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:06.892
But. more than half
of the sub-prime mortgages

622
00:41:06.927 --> 00:41:09.961
in the crisis started
right here at JD Wells.

623
00:41:09.996 --> 00:41:11.567
There's no reason
to be defensive.

624
00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.734
Just hear him out.

625
00:41:13.769 --> 00:41:16.198
No. this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

626
00:41:17.773 --> 00:41:19.234
Shit.

627
00:41:28.685 --> 00:41:30.685
But. more than half
of the sub-prime mortgages

628
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.853
in the crisis started
right here at JD Wells.

629
00:41:33.888 --> 00:41:35.283
There's no reason
to be defensive.

630
00:41:39.124 --> 00:41:40.761
Why would you send me that?

631
00:41:40.796 --> 00:41:44.567
Well. now this is
both our problems. isn't it?

632
00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:48.604
Didn't your mother teach you:
don't open links from strangers?

633
00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.672
This is a secure line.

634
00:41:50.707 --> 00:41:52.905
Is it?

635
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.709
Well. what are you waiting for?

636
00:41:54.744 --> 00:41:57.140
We're still figuring out
where he's at.

637
00:41:57.175 --> 00:41:59.010
There are
government agencies for that.

638
00:42:01.344 --> 00:42:02.981
So. you're ready
to derail this train

639
00:42:03.016 --> 00:42:05.720
after everything
we've been through?

640
00:42:05.755 --> 00:42:07.216
What about
the upcoming campaign?

641
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:09.218
Don't try that Southern comfort
bullshit with me.

642
00:42:09.253 --> 00:42:11.792
-What do you want?
-You've already been bought.

643
00:42:11.827 --> 00:42:13.959
What more can you offer?

644
00:42:27.843 --> 00:42:29.843
Don't ever compromise.

645
00:42:32.782 --> 00:42:35.244
What if I told you that when
an executive makes it to the top

646
00:42:35.279 --> 00:42:37.851
of JD Wells. they're rewarded
with what's called

647
00:42:37.886 --> 00:42:39.248
a "ghost account"?

648
00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:49.060
Filled to the brim with profits

649
00:42:49.095 --> 00:42:51.095
from insider trading.

650
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.130
illegal hidden fees.

651
00:42:53.165 --> 00:42:54.637
and interest fraud.

652
00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.771
I'd say prove it.

653
00:42:56.806 --> 00:42:58.201
Show him.

654
00:43:00.777 --> 00:43:04.240
That account there belongs to
the CEO of JD Wells.

655
00:43:06.948 --> 00:43:08.618
How do you trace
where all that's coming from?

656
00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:11.049
That's not the illegal one.

657
00:43:11.084 --> 00:43:13.623
He used to be the COO
before the scandal.

658
00:43:13.658 --> 00:43:15.317
Should we be looking at this?

659
00:43:15.352 --> 00:43:17.990
Well. this is all
public information.

660
00:43:18.025 --> 00:43:19.959
Our executives every year
allow their information

661
00:43:19.994 --> 00:43:23.259
to be published.
so this is nothing new.

662
00:43:23.294 --> 00:43:24.898
Show 'em the next one.

663
00:43:27.265 --> 00:43:29.166
That's his hidden account.

664
00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:32.202
not disclosed to the public
nor the IRS.

665
00:43:32.237 --> 00:43:34.105
It's $182 million.

666
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.207
Okay. so how do you
know all this?

667
00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:40.111
A little birdie told me.

668
00:43:40.146 --> 00:43:41.915
Show 'em the next one.

669
00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.151
That's the Chief
Technology Officer's.

670
00:43:47.186 --> 00:43:49.890
She's obviously
doing a little bit better.

671
00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:22.384
You know
I'm dedicated to my job.

672
00:44:22.419 --> 00:44:24.727
and if it's all true.

673
00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:27.257
I should know.

674
00:44:27.292 --> 00:44:29.259
so that I'm prepared.

675
00:44:35.872 --> 00:44:37.674
It's all bullshit.

676
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:14.469
So. you guys are "black hats."

677
00:45:14.504 --> 00:45:17.373
Hack-tivists.

678
00:45:17.408 --> 00:45:18.847
They're what now?

679
00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.146
They're hackers.

680
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:23.214
You can trust us.

681
00:45:23.249 --> 00:45:24.754
You can't be serious.

682
00:45:26.318 --> 00:45:28.285
I'm very serious.

683
00:45:32.192 --> 00:45:34.357
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

684
00:45:37.296 --> 00:45:40.000
All right.
how long have you known TJ?

685
00:45:40.035 --> 00:45:41.364
-What. TJ?
-Yes.

686
00:45:41.399 --> 00:45:43.366
Oh shit.
I thought she was a part

687
00:45:43.401 --> 00:45:46.974
-of some Anonymous-type shit.
-Keep your voice down. please.

688
00:45:47.009 --> 00:45:49.042
Nobody is with Anonymous.
you understand?

689
00:45:49.077 --> 00:45:51.077
Right. you can't admit it.

690
00:45:51.112 --> 00:45:52.848
that's the whole point.

691
00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:56.115
So. he shows you a few numbers
and now you're a hacker?

692
00:46:01.188 --> 00:46:03.485
Just let him finish.

693
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.026
Listen. I need you
to tone it down in there.

694
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:07.357
All right. I don't want
everyone thinking that

695
00:46:07.392 --> 00:46:09.898
I'm trying to con them.
or something.

696
00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.801
All right. mom's the word. man.

697
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:17.037
Look. I've got all your info.
I know you're not

698
00:46:17.072 --> 00:46:18.434
-from around here.
-So?

699
00:46:18.469 --> 00:46:22.339
So. I know you're
keeping things from me.

700
00:46:22.374 --> 00:46:25.078
TJ's my roommate?

701
00:46:26.983 --> 00:46:29.181
Just forget it.

702
00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:53.106
So. how do y'all feel
about taking it?

703
00:47:07.023 --> 00:47:08.583
Even if we believe
half the shit you just said.

704
00:47:08.618 --> 00:47:11.091
what makes you think we're gonna
take this stupid deal?

705
00:47:11.126 --> 00:47:12.895
-He just showed you proof.
-Maria.

706
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.161
-that could've been doctored.
-What does he have to gain

707
00:47:15.196 --> 00:47:16.492
-by mocking that up?
-You tell us.

708
00:47:16.527 --> 00:47:18.527
did you mock it up?

709
00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:23.037
You're joking. right?

710
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.636
Nothing's been mocked up.
this is real.

711
00:47:28.671 --> 00:47:30.143
Tell them. Frank.

712
00:47:33.379 --> 00:47:36.248
Hey. what was that little
meeting in the hall about?

713
00:47:36.283 --> 00:47:38.415
-He's not lying.
-Hey.

714
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.890
half hour ago
you were wearing a mask.

715
00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:44.190
Us. that's--that's what
he gains by all of this.

716
00:47:44.225 --> 00:47:45.928
He's getting us
to go along with it

717
00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.358
so that he can get away with it.

718
00:47:47.393 --> 00:47:49.030
Can't even give away
a couple million dollars.

719
00:47:49.065 --> 00:47:50.933
-can you?
-Then. why not keep it all

720
00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:53.430
-for yourself?
-He wants to spread the blame.

721
00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:55.036
It'll be too long
and complicated

722
00:47:55.071 --> 00:47:57.071
to try all of us.

723
00:47:57.106 --> 00:47:59.436
Yeah. but by then. we'd have
enough money to fight it.

724
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:01.504
A trial.
what are we talking about?

725
00:48:01.539 --> 00:48:04.672
We're not actually
doing this. are we?

726
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.957
Fight it with what.
stolen money?

727
00:48:47.992 --> 00:48:49.717
Stolen money that doesn't exist.

728
00:48:49.752 --> 00:48:51.191
You're a part of all this.

729
00:48:51.226 --> 00:48:52.291
How the hell can we trust you?

730
00:48:52.326 --> 00:48:53.589
These are powerful people.

731
00:48:53.624 --> 00:48:55.657
They'll figure it out
and get rid of us.

732
00:48:55.692 --> 00:48:58.132
No. that would just
open up an investigation.

733
00:48:58.167 --> 00:48:59.595
No. they have
more money than God.

734
00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.695
They'll get away with it.

735
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.235
No. they won't.

736
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:04.468
They get away with it.
we get away with it.

737
00:49:04.503 --> 00:49:06.536
-Two wrongs don't make a right.
-Yeah. but sometimes

738
00:49:06.571 --> 00:49:09.077
four gets you right back
to where you started.

739
00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.639
Joking's not
gonna help anything.

740
00:49:10.674 --> 00:49:11.706
More smartass bullshit.

741
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:14.148
We're not goin' along with this.

742
00:49:14.183 --> 00:49:17.118
Well. it's already been done.

743
00:49:17.153 --> 00:49:18.548
-Excuse me?
-You already did it?

744
00:49:18.583 --> 00:49:19.989
That's right!

745
00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:21.188
In a few days. you'll all be

746
00:49:21.223 --> 00:49:22.717
the richest people
that you know.

747
00:49:32.267 --> 00:49:34.069
Get ready to pull the stream.

748
00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.508
He's doing it.

749
00:49:44.543 --> 00:49:47.478
Ha! He's doin' it.

750
00:49:47.513 --> 00:49:49.480
-What?
-Refund?

751
00:49:49.515 --> 00:49:51.383
Yes. refunds.

752
00:49:51.418 --> 00:49:53.418
bill pay. cash transfers.
that kind of stuff.

753
00:49:53.453 --> 00:49:54.419
That's how it's gonna
show up in your accounts.

754
00:49:54.454 --> 00:49:55.754
Yeah. 'cause that
won't get red-flagged.

755
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:58.324
No. it won't because they're all
gonna be small enough amounts

756
00:49:58.359 --> 00:50:01.096
that it's not gonna
raise any suspicion.

757
00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.593
Got it on good authority
that we're in the clear.

758
00:50:03.628 --> 00:50:06.530
This could be
a new start for us.

759
00:50:06.565 --> 00:50:08.367
Just wanted to document
here what a real-world

760
00:50:08.402 --> 00:50:10.171
Daddy Warbucks looks like.

761
00:50:10.206 --> 00:50:12.338
Aaron. please do not post that.

762
00:50:12.373 --> 00:50:14.505
It's just for me. man.

763
00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.803
You won't get away with this.

764
00:50:15.838 --> 00:50:17.442
Get away with it?

765
00:50:17.477 --> 00:50:19.510
He just gave you
a couple thousand dollars.

766
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.580
Yeah. and Frank made sure
you were in on it.

767
00:50:23.615 --> 00:50:25.681
-Allison.
-What?

768
00:50:25.716 --> 00:50:28.057
You make half a million
a year yourself.

769
00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:30.191
not including what
your husband makes.

770
00:50:30.226 --> 00:50:33.425
Therefore I don't know where
this money could do some good?

771
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.756
Yeah. what the fuck

772
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:37.594
do you care?

773
00:50:37.629 --> 00:50:41.136
Oh. the food bank?

774
00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.731
Yes. the food bank.

775
00:50:42.766 --> 00:50:44.337
Really? Is that your sob story?

776
00:50:44.372 --> 00:50:47.439
"I robbed the bank
for the children?"

777
00:50:52.545 --> 00:50:54.677
I don't need a sob story.

778
00:50:54.712 --> 00:50:56.118
In a few weeks.
you'll both have more money

779
00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:58.120
-than you make in a year.
-What about them?

780
00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:00.353
You don't steal from these
people and get away with it.

781
00:51:00.388 --> 00:51:02.487
They will see
what we want them to see.

782
00:51:02.522 --> 00:51:04.192
on their end.
on their interface.

783
00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:07.426
it'll just be another
million-dollar day.

784
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:08.724
We'll turn you in.

785
00:51:08.759 --> 00:51:10.726
Collin. stop
defending these people.

786
00:51:10.761 --> 00:51:13.201
-They don't deserve it.
-And. and. for what?

787
00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.698
For giving you millions
that no one will ever miss?

788
00:51:15.733 --> 00:51:19.768
For threatening
and endangering our lives!

789
00:51:23.411 --> 00:51:25.147
What the hell was that?

790
00:51:34.323 --> 00:51:35.389
Let the record show

791
00:51:35.424 --> 00:51:39.194
that no one ever had
a live round pointed at them.

792
00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:40.360
-I did!
-Yeah?

793
00:51:40.395 --> 00:51:42.131
Well. Frank.
you were in on this.

794
00:51:42.166 --> 00:51:45.464
And this was not the plan!

795
00:51:45.499 --> 00:51:47.631
Honestly. I hope you all
live your lives to the fullest

796
00:51:47.666 --> 00:51:50.271
after what we've
accomplished here today.

797
00:51:50.306 --> 00:51:52.636
Collin. look out!

798
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:55.177
We are not leaving this room
until everyone agrees

799
00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:56.442
never to speak of this!

800
00:51:56.477 --> 00:51:58.543
And who's gonna make us?

801
00:51:58.578 --> 00:51:59.644
Everyone. shut up!

802
00:51:59.679 --> 00:52:02.316
Everyone just shut up
and someone hand me my phone

803
00:52:02.351 --> 00:52:03.779
-right now!
-Jane is right.

804
00:52:03.814 --> 00:52:05.583
This is not
what we talked about.

805
00:52:05.618 --> 00:52:06.782
Just hand me my phone.

806
00:52:06.817 --> 00:52:08.223
Allison. careful.

807
00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:09.719
-Hand me my phone.
-Careful.

808
00:52:09.754 --> 00:52:10.918
You hand her the phone.

809
00:52:10.953 --> 00:52:12.326
and we all go to prison.

810
00:52:12.361 --> 00:52:14.262
And you'd have to shoot me.

811
00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.692
but I know you
don't wanna do that.

812
00:52:15.727 --> 00:52:19.498
So. could we just sit down
and talk this out?

813
00:52:19.533 --> 00:52:22.369
We talked while he
turned us into criminals.

814
00:52:22.404 --> 00:52:24.206
Just give me my phone.

815
00:52:33.679 --> 00:52:35.382
Can we just back out of this?

816
00:52:35.417 --> 00:52:37.285
There's no use.

817
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.881
-Signal's down again.
-Shut up!

818
00:52:39.916 --> 00:52:42.323
Give Collin his gun back.

819
00:52:42.358 --> 00:52:43.522
He's a little busy

820
00:52:43.557 --> 00:52:45.656
-right now.
-Allison. Allison.

821
00:52:45.691 --> 00:52:48.296
Frank. what the hell
is going on?

822
00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.397
You hurt that girl.

823
00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:52.333
-and I'll kill you.
-No one is going to hurt anyone!

824
00:52:52.368 --> 00:52:53.829
Allison. if you shoot
anyone in this room.

825
00:52:53.864 --> 00:52:55.270
you're gonna
have to kill us all.

826
00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:56.535
Shut up!

827
00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:58.867
I've got this!

828
00:52:58.902 --> 00:53:03.443
Look. you can keep the gun.

829
00:53:03.478 --> 00:53:04.377
Just lower it.

830
00:53:04.413 --> 00:53:06.842
and let's sit down
and talk about this.

831
00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:12.815
Him first.

832
00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.587
Okay.

833
00:53:15.622 --> 00:53:16.984
Can we agree to that?

834
00:53:18.922 --> 00:53:21.263
What do you say?

835
00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.759
Why not?

836
00:53:26.028 --> 00:53:27.236
Okay.

837
00:53:29.933 --> 00:53:33.605
-Okay.
-Someone may be dead.

838
00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.773
We can bury his allegations.
easy enough.

839
00:53:36.808 --> 00:53:39.006
We can even bury the code.

840
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:41.250
-but a body?
-Please. if that's the case.

841
00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:43.780
he signed his fate
as a terrorist.

842
00:53:43.815 --> 00:53:45.914
The video that proves
he killed someone

843
00:53:45.949 --> 00:53:48.389
also discusses
everything going on.

844
00:53:48.424 --> 00:53:50.589
Then if I were you. I'd stop
trying to politicize this.

845
00:53:50.624 --> 00:53:52.789
and I would bury
that code right away.

846
00:54:01.932 --> 00:54:03.866
Okay.

847
00:54:23.987 --> 00:54:25.591
You really shouldn't
have done that.

848
00:54:25.626 --> 00:54:28.957
Yeah. and we shouldn't
still be here either.

849
00:54:28.992 --> 00:54:30.431
Whoa. hold on.

850
00:54:30.466 --> 00:54:33.335
Ho--Try and stop me.

851
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.898
Please.

852
00:54:35.933 --> 00:54:39.671
When were you going to let me in
all of these plan changes?

853
00:54:39.706 --> 00:54:41.772
-Things change. all right?
-What the fuck is going on?

854
00:54:41.807 --> 00:54:42.674
What the fuck are you doing?

855
00:54:42.709 --> 00:54:43.774
Just let him go!

856
00:54:43.809 --> 00:54:45.842
-And implicate us all?
-Implicate?

857
00:54:45.877 --> 00:54:47.580
We're going to
figure this all out.

858
00:54:47.615 --> 00:54:49.879
Who the hell do you
think you are?

859
00:54:49.914 --> 00:54:51.716
How did any of you

860
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:53.817
think this was going to work?

861
00:54:53.852 --> 00:54:56.325
Because it already has worked.

862
00:55:00.661 --> 00:55:02.331
Haven't we already
been down this road?

863
00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:03.794
If I have to put my gun down.

864
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:07.028
he shouldn't be able
to touch his laptop.

865
00:55:07.063 --> 00:55:08.997
That's apples to apples.

866
00:55:09.032 --> 00:55:10.702
Eh. fair enough.

867
00:55:14.037 --> 00:55:17.005
You said everybody was gonna
have the opportunity to opt in.

868
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.239
Well. I think it
became very obvious

869
00:55:18.275 --> 00:55:20.976
that they wouldn't unless
I showed them personal proof.

870
00:55:21.011 --> 00:55:22.516
So you took away
our choice in the matter?

871
00:55:22.551 --> 00:55:25.948
I'm sorry I gave you
all that money.

872
00:55:25.983 --> 00:55:28.423
If you want out.
you can walk out.

873
00:55:30.592 --> 00:55:32.020
And how we supposed to do that

874
00:55:32.055 --> 00:55:34.528
with that asshole
standin' there?

875
00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.730
If we promise
to walk out safely.

876
00:55:38.765 --> 00:55:40.061
will you get out of the way?

877
00:55:40.096 --> 00:55:42.096
Sure.

878
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:45.099
If she gives me her gun first.

879
00:55:45.134 --> 00:55:46.804
How 'bout it?

880
00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:49.070
Why does it matter
if we all agree?

881
00:55:49.105 --> 00:55:52.447
If no one leaks this.
we all benefit.

882
00:56:06.023 --> 00:56:08.430
Allison?

883
00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.893
What are you doing?

884
00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.012
Feeling better now?

885
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:35.424
Is that all that was for you?

886
00:56:35.459 --> 00:56:37.085
What else would it be?

887
00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:54.003
I'm not sayin'
that I'm doin' this.

888
00:56:54.038 --> 00:56:56.676
but. uh.

889
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:58.172
what about the taxes?

890
00:56:58.207 --> 00:57:01.208
Do you report cash deposits
straight into your account?

891
00:57:01.243 --> 00:57:03.980
What about electronic
transfers between accounts?

892
00:57:04.015 --> 00:57:05.114
Why let us in on this?

893
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.852
Spreading the blame
can't be worth all this risk.

894
00:57:07.887 --> 00:57:09.689
You can call me an idealist.

895
00:57:09.724 --> 00:57:12.219
or a patriot if that
makes you feel better.

896
00:57:12.254 --> 00:57:13.187
A terrorist.

897
00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:15.893
Yeah. didn't Oswald
call himself a patriot?

898
00:57:15.928 --> 00:57:18.764
You're trying to redeem yourself
for being a part of this?

899
00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:20.799
Look. just because you
don't exactly understand

900
00:57:20.834 --> 00:57:22.097
what I've done here today

901
00:57:22.132 --> 00:57:24.704
doesn't change the fact
that it's happened.

902
00:57:24.739 --> 00:57:28.004
No sum of money
is worth this shit.

903
00:57:28.039 --> 00:57:29.874
Does that mean you're
gonna turn us in?

904
00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:34.175
Not necessarily.
I mean. you know.

905
00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:36.881
what's done is done. right?

906
00:57:36.916 --> 00:57:38.586
So. just like that?

907
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.214
You turn a blind eye?

908
00:57:40.249 --> 00:57:42.656
Hey. I got no intentions
of spendin' my final days

909
00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:43.987
in a jail cell.

910
00:57:44.022 --> 00:57:46.759
These executives were born
in the same world as us.

911
00:57:46.794 --> 00:57:48.156
and they choose to exploit it.

912
00:57:48.191 --> 00:57:50.026
And that gives us
a right to take it?

913
00:57:50.061 --> 00:57:52.600
If we just accept this.
we are just like them.

914
00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:55.768
No. these are the 20 most
affluent people in the world.

915
00:57:55.803 --> 00:57:57.902
You are nothing like them.

916
00:58:00.038 --> 00:58:02.643
If he says he gave it to us.

917
00:58:02.678 --> 00:58:04.711
-I'm not gonna argue.
-Exactly.

918
00:58:04.746 --> 00:58:05.679
Why should we go to prison

919
00:58:05.714 --> 00:58:07.747
for something that we
had nothing to do with?

920
00:58:07.782 --> 00:58:09.210
Aiding and abetting.

921
00:58:09.245 --> 00:58:10.948
How?

922
00:58:10.983 --> 00:58:12.620
Did you help them
type up all that code?

923
00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.589
And a court would have to
establish that. right?

924
00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:17.119
But if we decide here and now
that no one's gonna tell anyone.

925
00:58:17.154 --> 00:58:18.725
that's all a non-issue.

926
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.090
We take this to our graves.
or we all go down.

927
00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:24.258
We can't all possibly
keep this under wraps.

928
00:58:24.293 --> 00:58:27.030
Honestly. you think that not one
of us is gonna go to the cops

929
00:58:27.065 --> 00:58:29.703
as soon as we step
outside those doors?

930
00:58:43.213 --> 00:58:44.619
Releasing the video would just

931
00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:47.083
throw us directly into the fire.

932
00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:54.321
But...

933
00:58:54.356 --> 00:58:57.797
we don't wanna be 100 percent
reactionary to this.

934
00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:09.578
You still workin'
on that location?

935
00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:11.272
You'll know when I know.

936
00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:21.887
So. maybe we get ahead of this.

937
00:59:21.922 --> 00:59:23.658
What do you have in mind?

938
00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:28.124
I'm not ruining anyone's
life just because.

939
00:59:28.159 --> 00:59:33.228
just because this strange
opportunity fell in our lap.

940
00:59:33.263 --> 00:59:35.835
Maria. what are you saying?

941
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:38.299
If my silence means
a better future for our child.

942
00:59:38.334 --> 00:59:40.070
so be it.

943
00:59:40.105 --> 00:59:42.204
I'm in.

944
00:59:42.239 --> 00:59:43.942
And I won't change my mind.

945
00:59:43.977 --> 00:59:45.075
Of course you are.

946
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:45.976
What's that supposed to mean?

947
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:47.209
Means you're just
another millennial

948
00:59:47.244 --> 00:59:48.683
looking for a handout.

949
00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:49.981
Think what you want. man.

950
00:59:50.016 --> 00:59:51.851
Is that what you think
of all millennials?

951
00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:57.824
Do you all not see

952
00:59:57.859 --> 01:00:00.926
how this money
could do some good?

953
01:00:00.961 --> 01:00:04.061
Credit cards. mortgages.
student loans?

954
01:00:04.096 --> 01:00:06.734
Car payments?

955
01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.901
Medical bills?

956
01:00:08.936 --> 01:00:11.101
That's all gone!

957
01:00:11.136 --> 01:00:14.676
Money does not equal happiness.

958
01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:15.875
Amen.

959
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.910
That. we might never agree on.

960
01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:19.747
Look. this is
getting us nowhere.

961
01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.212
All right. this is gonna
sound a little crazy.

962
01:00:23.247 --> 01:00:25.654
but can I see a show of hands?

963
01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:26.985
Who's willing
to walk out of here

964
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.987
and never speak of this again?

965
01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:40.229
And. of course. me.

966
01:00:40.264 --> 01:00:43.672
There is no choice.
just the illusion of one.

967
01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:45.971
It doesn't matter what we do.

968
01:00:46.006 --> 01:00:47.302
So. that's a yes?

969
01:00:47.337 --> 01:00:49.007
No.

970
01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:50.910
We're still not
100 percent here.

971
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.914
How do you mean?

972
01:00:54.949 --> 01:00:57.411
Him. Mr. Washington.

973
01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.149
What are you talkin' about?

974
01:00:59.184 --> 01:01:01.217
What. you weren't
gonna tell 'em?

975
01:01:01.252 --> 01:01:02.383
That you're FBI?

976
01:01:02.418 --> 01:01:03.791
What the fuck are you doin'?

977
01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.694
Way to confirm it. big man.

978
01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:08.092
What are you doin'
in my face. huh?

979
01:01:08.127 --> 01:01:09.896
Huh. you wanna shoot me?

980
01:01:09.931 --> 01:01:12.162
Wanna shoot me. then
go ahead and fuckin' do it!

981
01:01:12.197 --> 01:01:14.329
Blow this whole fuckin'
thing off the roof!

982
01:01:14.364 --> 01:01:16.771
Do not test me.

983
01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:18.740
Don't test you?

984
01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.434
You better do it
or back the fuck up

985
01:01:20.469 --> 01:01:21.974
because we're trying to do
something good here.

986
01:01:22.009 --> 01:01:23.371
and you're getting in the way.

987
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:32.413
I figured you'd
all wanna know that.

988
01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:36.021
Having a bureau man
as protection

989
01:01:36.056 --> 01:01:37.825
goes a pretty long way.
doesn't it?

990
01:01:39.928 --> 01:01:42.027
Now I won't tell 'em
your name. unless you make me.

991
01:01:44.394 --> 01:01:45.899
What do you think. Collin. huh?

992
01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:48.231
You're so fuckin'
high and mighty.

993
01:01:48.266 --> 01:01:51.465
Think the FBI
wanna know about this?

994
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.742
I'm sure they're
already tracking it.

995
01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:55.744
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

996
01:01:57.143 --> 01:01:59.847
So. he's your inside guy.

997
01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.751
There's proper channels
for whistleblowers.

998
01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:04.247
Within the system. right?

999
01:02:04.282 --> 01:02:06.821
Run it up the flag pole?

1000
01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.218
That same system
that you're defending

1001
01:02:08.253 --> 01:02:09.989
is the very arm of the law

1002
01:02:10.024 --> 01:02:13.190
designed to
investigate such crimes.

1003
01:02:13.225 --> 01:02:15.324
and even he can't help
but take a piece.

1004
01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:17.062
What are you talkin' about?

1005
01:02:17.097 --> 01:02:19.900
They told us they wouldn't
take anything for themselves.

1006
01:02:19.935 --> 01:02:21.902
That's right. Jane.

1007
01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:25.532
This was supposed to be
an act of moral principle.

1008
01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:27.941
-Do you wanna see?
-No. just

1009
01:02:27.976 --> 01:02:30.240
tell us what this
is really about.

1010
01:02:30.275 --> 01:02:32.506
The original plan.

1011
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.640
the one that Frank
keeps alluding to.

1012
01:02:33.676 --> 01:02:36.147
we were supposed to come in
and secure the location.

1013
01:02:36.182 --> 01:02:38.787
buy time. make the hack.
and get the fuck out.

1014
01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:41.449
Yeah. but you fucked that plan
when you took your mask off.

1015
01:02:41.484 --> 01:02:43.891
And you got selfish.

1016
01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.827
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1017
01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.829
It's on the computer.

1018
01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.831
Do you wanna see?
Does anybody else wanna see?

1019
01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:51.800
-He's lying.
-Am I?

1020
01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.428
What about you?

1021
01:02:53.463 --> 01:02:55.001
Who are you?

1022
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:59.335
Just tryin' to bring
a little balance to this mess.

1023
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:00.369
Oh?

1024
01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:02.338
Oh. and you think
you're the one to do that?

1025
01:03:02.373 --> 01:03:04.406
That's a little arrogant.
don't you think?

1026
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:05.574
What?

1027
01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:08.047
You're defending him.
the guy still wearing a mask?

1028
01:03:08.082 --> 01:03:09.983
You risked our lives.

1029
01:03:10.018 --> 01:03:12.216
your own

1030
01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:14.515
to make this
look like a robbery?

1031
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:17.089
To hand over some cash?

1032
01:03:17.124 --> 01:03:18.959
Fortune favors the bold.

1033
01:03:18.994 --> 01:03:21.192
No. you coulda done this
from your couch.

1034
01:03:21.227 --> 01:03:22.930
There's something
you're not telling us.

1035
01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.327
Just how much exactly
do you think you

1036
01:03:24.362 --> 01:03:26.263
don't understand. Collin?

1037
01:03:26.298 --> 01:03:28.397
Fuck you.

1038
01:03:28.432 --> 01:03:31.334
Oh. my. I'd say we're making
some great progress here.

1039
01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:32.973
now. aren't we?

1040
01:03:36.473 --> 01:03:38.814
I need to take a piss.

1041
01:04:03.302 --> 01:04:07.073
Where are you going?

1042
01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:09.075
I'm not allowed to go?

1043
01:04:18.218 --> 01:04:20.482
So how long have you
been divorced?

1044
01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:36.069
-I admire your courage. Collin.
-My personal life

1045
01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:38.038
has nothing to do with this.

1046
01:04:38.073 --> 01:04:40.139
I'm sure you'd like us
all to believe that.

1047
01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.110
Your family deserves this.

1048
01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:47.674
You know what I do
three nights a week?

1049
01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:51.117
Step out on your family
with Allison?

1050
01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:54.252
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

1051
01:04:54.287 --> 01:04:58.256
My family's never taken
a single thing they didn't earn.

1052
01:04:58.291 --> 01:04:59.554
I'm not starting now.

1053
01:04:59.589 --> 01:05:02.095
That's pride talking.

1054
01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:04.031
I mean. he has a point though.

1055
01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.462
Isn't life hard enough
without being a single mother?

1056
01:05:06.497 --> 01:05:08.596
Earlier today. we were
begging for a mortgage.

1057
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:11.071
Now our children
won't beg for anything.

1058
01:05:12.569 --> 01:05:14.602
Night classes.

1059
01:05:14.637 --> 01:05:16.340
criminal justice.

1060
01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:19.244
So your family can know
the injustice of their father

1061
01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:21.477
and husband
dying in the streets?

1062
01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:23.083
I'll put a gun to
your head for the camera.

1063
01:05:23.118 --> 01:05:26.119
if it'll make you feel better.

1064
01:05:26.154 --> 01:05:27.989
You've been saying all day
"Let's just get out of here."

1065
01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.090
and now you wanna be a hero?

1066
01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:31.388
Don't you think
a woman like yours

1067
01:05:31.423 --> 01:05:33.962
would do a lot more
with this money than

1068
01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:36.360
those bankers?

1069
01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:39.396
Don't be afraid of
being hypocritical. Collin.

1070
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:41.101
We all are.

1071
01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:49.340
Well. apparently.

1072
01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:51.606
because you and I
are sleeping together.

1073
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:53.707
I'm just supposed to
go along with all this.

1074
01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:56.644
-Collin.
-So sick of this shit!

1075
01:05:56.679 --> 01:05:58.613
I can't believe
we're outnumbered here!

1076
01:05:58.648 --> 01:06:00.450
What's wrong is wrong!

1077
01:06:00.485 --> 01:06:02.056
Wrong is just a line in the sand

1078
01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:05.356
that changes with every tide.

1079
01:06:05.391 --> 01:06:06.720
How do you supposed
to argue with that?

1080
01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:08.623
How 'bout you
sit down and shut up.

1081
01:06:08.658 --> 01:06:09.624
No!

1082
01:06:09.659 --> 01:06:10.526
You're gonna have to shoot me.

1083
01:06:10.561 --> 01:06:15.333
Collin. sit down!

1084
01:06:15.368 --> 01:06:16.631
Now.

1085
01:06:20.439 --> 01:06:22.175
Sit down.

1086
01:06:29.217 --> 01:06:31.481
Now. Frank.

1087
01:06:31.516 --> 01:06:34.319
Frank. you are the one
who got us into this mess.

1088
01:06:34.354 --> 01:06:37.058
so tell us.

1089
01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:38.719
how do we get out of it?

1090
01:06:38.754 --> 01:06:42.525
We all agree to disagree
and we walk.

1091
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.692
Someone wants to
go to the cops. fine.

1092
01:06:44.727 --> 01:06:46.562
Where's the proof?

1093
01:06:46.597 --> 01:06:48.729
This company gave me

1094
01:06:48.764 --> 01:06:50.665
my first real job.

1095
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.108
Don't be ridiculous!

1096
01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.704
I gave you your first job.

1097
01:06:56.739 --> 01:06:58.508
So. you

1098
01:06:58.543 --> 01:07:01.115
are more of a martyr than him?

1099
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.349
I've worked here for longer
than you've been alive.

1100
01:07:04.384 --> 01:07:07.649
and they spat in my face.

1101
01:07:07.684 --> 01:07:10.355
They stole from
a quarter of the planet.

1102
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:13.787
You are naive for thinking
you can't take this money.

1103
01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:14.888
Enough. enough.

1104
01:07:14.923 --> 01:07:17.263
Wouldn't you rather
spend the rest of your life

1105
01:07:17.298 --> 01:07:18.396
with your son?

1106
01:07:18.431 --> 01:07:21.102
Stop using my child against me.

1107
01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.837
You know. if you care
so much about this. then

1108
01:07:30.872 --> 01:07:33.081
why not include the Flores'?

1109
01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.511
What?

1110
01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:38.548
I didn't not
include the Flores'.

1111
01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:40.121
Why not just

1112
01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:41.683
sit them in a waiting room

1113
01:07:41.718 --> 01:07:43.289
until all this went down.

1114
01:07:43.324 --> 01:07:45.291
and you could change
their life forever?

1115
01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:47.194
There was nothing I could do.

1116
01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:49.427
You couldn't
pop your head out

1117
01:07:49.462 --> 01:07:53.266
and just let them know
their mortgage was approved?

1118
01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:55.532
I knew that if
we started the process.

1119
01:07:55.567 --> 01:07:59.536
you would still be here
when these two guys came in.

1120
01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:02.176
But no need for that
mortgage now. huh?

1121
01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:04.343
I didn't wanna put
your child at risk.

1122
01:08:04.378 --> 01:08:06.873
He was trying to
limit the shares.

1123
01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:09.381
-You're not just two--
-Shares?

1124
01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:12.153
There's no limit
to this kind of money!

1125
01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:14.386
Why are we any less deserving
than your employees?

1126
01:08:14.421 --> 01:08:16.652
Or her?

1127
01:08:16.687 --> 01:08:18.489
Luckily. she came to get us.

1128
01:08:20.757 --> 01:08:22.262
Jane?

1129
01:08:26.862 --> 01:08:30.798
Look. I made a judgement call.

1130
01:08:30.833 --> 01:08:32.470
So did I.

1131
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:16.877
Okay. new deal.

1132
01:09:16.912 --> 01:09:18.549
We're gonna open-source this.

1133
01:09:18.584 --> 01:09:19.847
We're gonna boot
the camera back up.

1134
01:09:19.882 --> 01:09:21.387
and we're gonna need a take two.

1135
01:09:21.422 --> 01:09:22.254
All right?

1136
01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:23.620
Everybody's gonna
raise their hand

1137
01:09:23.655 --> 01:09:25.325
in unanimous agreement.

1138
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.426
And then. afterwards.
I'm gonna give you the video.

1139
01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:29.956
That means that we all get
to walk out of here alive

1140
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:31.958
with millions of dollars
in our account

1141
01:09:31.993 --> 01:09:34.235
and video proof showing
that you were forced

1142
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.798
to take the deal at gunpoint.

1143
01:09:36.833 --> 01:09:38.239
Does everybody like that?

1144
01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.769
Does that make sense?

1145
01:09:40.804 --> 01:09:43.343
Stop. I just want out of here!

1146
01:09:47.382 --> 01:09:50.614
Collin. if you really
can't live with it.

1147
01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:52.880
just donate it to
charity or something.

1148
01:09:52.915 --> 01:09:56.455
I don't know. but we.

1149
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.622
we can't ruin
these people's lives.

1150
01:10:01.825 --> 01:10:03.429
You think she can take it?

1151
01:10:05.466 --> 01:10:07.466
I just needed to pay my rent.

1152
01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:10.271
That was the only fuckin'
reason I was here today.

1153
01:10:29.457 --> 01:10:30.819
Where are your pills?

1154
01:10:36.662 --> 01:10:38.563
Black and white container.

1155
01:11:02.688 --> 01:11:03.951
It's gonna be okay.

1156
01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:25.775
Okay.

1157
01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:27.546
-Okay.
-Okay.

1158
01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:33.519
No. this isn't right.

1159
01:11:33.554 --> 01:11:34.454
Collin.

1160
01:11:34.489 --> 01:11:35.950
Look at her!

1161
01:11:35.985 --> 01:11:38.557
Look at what all of you
have done to her!

1162
01:11:38.592 --> 01:11:39.525
You don't think she'll crack?

1163
01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.559
She's already broken!

1164
01:11:40.594 --> 01:11:42.891
-Collin!
-You did this!

1165
01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:44.398
Hey. don't you
want to silence her?

1166
01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.828
Go ahead. do it. do it. do it!

1167
01:11:45.863 --> 01:11:47.995
Go ahead. you wanna do it?
Fuck 'em. hm?

1168
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:49.766
You're the only one who can
make hard decisions. right?

1169
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:50.965
So why don't you do it?

1170
01:11:52.936 --> 01:11:54.507
-Come on. fuckin' do it!
-Don't move!

1171
01:11:54.542 --> 01:11:55.475
That's enough!

1172
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:56.509
It's okay. I got this.

1173
01:11:56.544 --> 01:11:58.511
It's okay. I. I. I got it.

1174
01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:03.351
-Get off your computer!
-Collin.

1175
01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:04.847
-put the gun down!
-Can everyone just please

1176
01:12:04.882 --> 01:12:06.486
calm the fuck down?

1177
01:12:06.521 --> 01:12:08.587
Clearly. we're not getting
through to you. Collin. are we?

1178
01:12:10.118 --> 01:12:11.251
-Allison. just--
-Whoa!

1179
01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:13.460
-You two are going nowhere.
-Collin. put the gun down.

1180
01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.593
you're gonna
get somebody killed!

1181
01:12:14.628 --> 01:12:15.594
Okay.

1182
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:17.090
Where you gonna go. Collin. huh?

1183
01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:18.960
Where you gonna go?

1184
01:12:18.995 --> 01:12:20.698
What's your story?

1185
01:12:20.733 --> 01:12:22.370
Ten people are
conspiring against you

1186
01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:24.064
that are gonna steal
millions from ghost accounts

1187
01:12:24.099 --> 01:12:25.670
and then give you a cut?

1188
01:12:25.705 --> 01:12:27.067
Is that your story?

1189
01:12:27.102 --> 01:12:29.509
You gotta know when
you're beat. son.

1190
01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:35.812
I'm not going with you.

1191
01:12:35.847 --> 01:12:37.913
I'm sorry. you're on your own.

1192
01:12:39.752 --> 01:12:42.588
Look. look at that. huh?

1193
01:12:42.623 --> 01:12:44.953
Don't do it.

1194
01:12:44.988 --> 01:12:46.592
Think about that.

1195
01:12:51.896 --> 01:12:54.666
Just let go.

1196
01:12:54.701 --> 01:12:56.437
Just let it go.

1197
01:13:09.045 --> 01:13:10.715
No. no. no. no. no. Megan!

1198
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.750
Megan. you're fine. you're fine!

1199
01:13:12.785 --> 01:13:14.422
No!

1200
01:13:16.624 --> 01:13:18.426
Oh. fuck!

1201
01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:19.658
God!

1202
01:13:22.091 --> 01:13:24.597
Is this what I got to fucking do
to get you to listen to me?

1203
01:13:24.632 --> 01:13:26.797
God fuckin' dammit!

1204
01:13:28.768 --> 01:13:31.065
God fucking dammit!

1205
01:13:35.907 --> 01:13:38.039
Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1206
01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:05.506
-Frank. it looks--
-Yeah. I know

1207
01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.068
that their application
says approved.

1208
01:14:07.103 --> 01:14:08.608
but don't tell them that.

1209
01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:09.840
Is something wrong?

1210
01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:11.743
Just tell them to
come in on Monday.

1211
01:14:11.778 --> 01:14:13.877
and I will walk them through it.

1212
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:16.616
Okay.

1213
01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:22.050
Hi. sir. how can I help you?

1214
01:14:22.085 --> 01:14:23.887
Yeah. I don't have
my account number.

1215
01:14:23.922 --> 01:14:26.593
Y'all set me up on
a new business account. so.

1216
01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.221
That. that's okay.

1217
01:14:28.256 --> 01:14:30.927
Just go ahead
and fill this slip out

1218
01:14:30.962 --> 01:14:33.193
to the best of your ability.
and I can do the rest.

1219
01:14:33.228 --> 01:14:35.129
-Okay?
-All right.

1220
01:14:35.164 --> 01:14:36.537
Ma'am. I'm so sorry.

1221
01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:39.001
We're short-staffed
on Saturdays.

1222
01:14:39.036 --> 01:14:40.739
I don't think I can
take off again Monday.

1223
01:14:40.774 --> 01:14:42.708
Why don't I just drop
you off at work on Monday.

1224
01:14:42.743 --> 01:14:45.579
and I'll come over here?

1225
01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:46.514
All right.

1226
01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.935
Um. I need my check
deposited by today.

1227
01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:15.268
If I could maybe just get
a deposit slip really quickly?

1228
01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:16.874
Yeah. I can take
care of that for you.

1229
01:15:16.909 --> 01:15:20.306
It will be much quicker
if you come inside.

1230
01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:21.813
Thank you.

1231
01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:02.590
So if I get me one
of them new smartphones.

1232
01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.251
I could do all this from home.

1233
01:16:06.926 --> 01:16:07.958
Uh. yes. sir.

1234
01:16:07.993 --> 01:16:08.792
All you need to do is

1235
01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:10.356
download the JD Wells
banking app

1236
01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:12.358
and you should be good to go.

1237
01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:17.605
Now that'd may be
reason enough to get one.

1238
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.906
But then again.

1239
01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:21.939
I wouldn't have the pleasure
of seein' you now would I?

1240
01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:28.649
I'm sorry about that.

1241
01:16:43.292 --> 01:16:45.193
It's a bit busier
than we thought.

1242
01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:12.957
Um. last time.

1243
01:17:12.992 --> 01:17:14.761
think it was your manager.

1244
01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:18.193
mentioned that I was up
for a small business loan.

1245
01:17:18.228 --> 01:17:19.799
Can we get that put together?

1246
01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:25.871
Did you barf?

1247
01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.956
We're actually about to close.

1248
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:47.024
uh. I can set up
an appointment for you.

1249
01:17:47.059 --> 01:17:48.454
When would be a good time?

1250
01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:53.030
How 'bout first thing
Monday morning?

1251
01:17:53.065 --> 01:17:55.131
Oh. sorry. hold on.

1252
01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:58.299
Frank. can I get your assistance
at the front. please?

1253
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.205
Frank. are you there?

1254
01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.439
Just. just a second.

1255
01:18:14.449 --> 01:18:15.921
Shit.

1256
01:18:26.098 --> 01:18:28.164
God.

1257
01:18:28.199 --> 01:18:29.770
Sorry about that.

1258
01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:54.828
I'm. I'm really sorry
about this. just

1259
01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:56.423
give me one second.

1260
01:20:07.463 --> 01:20:10.002
JD Wells internal security.
this is Pam.

1261
01:20:10.037 --> 01:20:11.267
Is this an emergency?

1262
01:20:11.302 --> 01:20:13.038
Looks like we lost
the camera stream

1263
01:20:13.073 --> 01:20:15.205
for one of your branches.

1264
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.878
You got anything on your end?

1265
01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:19.473
I think I remember
someone mentioning

1266
01:20:19.508 --> 01:20:21.948
maintenance going on
at a couple locations.

1267
01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.280
You're going to
respond to dispatch.

1268
01:20:29.056 --> 01:20:30.924
Yeah. here it is.

1269
01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:33.190
Out in the burbs
on Johnson Avenue.

1270
01:20:33.225 --> 01:20:35.225
Routine maintenance.

1271
01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.194
Looks like it's time we switch
out the internal batteries

1272
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:39.229
on those cams
if we lost the stream.

1273
01:20:39.264 --> 01:20:40.626
I'd say so.

1274
01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:48.373
Here we go.

1275
01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:52.176
I'm seeing on my end that
they've verified over radio.

1276
01:20:52.211 --> 01:20:55.014
This is what we get for
bein' the weekend shift. right?

1277
01:20:55.049 --> 01:20:56.917
Nobody tells us nothin'.

1278
01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:58.413
No shit.

1279
01:20:58.448 --> 01:21:00.085
Have a good one.

1280
01:21:50.203 --> 01:21:52.236
It's over?

1281
01:21:52.271 --> 01:21:53.974
As far as we can tell.

1282
01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:56.977
Nothing tragic?

1283
01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.242
Time will tell.

1284
01:22:02.446 --> 01:22:03.379
Any sort of hearing

1285
01:22:03.414 --> 01:22:06.151
would likely be much
more complicated now.

1286
01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.716
Well. I'll do what I do.
and you do what you do.

1287
01:22:18.594 --> 01:22:20.561
You wanna know who he is?

1288
01:22:27.702 --> 01:22:29.306
We hired him...

1289
01:22:31.475 --> 01:22:33.981
...to audit our entire system.

1290
01:22:36.216 --> 01:22:37.149
He must have found something

1291
01:22:37.184 --> 01:22:39.745
he thought could be
interpreted this way.

1292
01:22:43.289 --> 01:22:44.354
That was good.
but you might wanna

1293
01:22:44.389 --> 01:22:46.422
rehearse it a bit more.

1294
01:23:17.719 --> 01:23:19.224
Selfish. huh?

1295
01:23:22.658 --> 01:23:24.559
What makes you think
it was for me?

1296
01:23:24.594 --> 01:23:25.758
That's not the point.

1297
01:23:33.207 --> 01:23:35.240
Everything that went wrong today

1298
01:23:35.275 --> 01:23:36.472
was your fault.

1299
01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:41.246
We coulda had this thing
wrapped in a bow hours ago.

1300
01:23:41.281 --> 01:23:44.513
but you had to go get all
self-righteous on everybody.

1301
01:23:44.548 --> 01:23:46.713
They don't know whether
to trust us or fear us.

1302
01:23:46.748 --> 01:23:48.286
and that's thanks to me.

1303
01:23:50.521 --> 01:23:52.455
Was that your plan for me too?

1304
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.468
I'd say you're the most
idealistic person I know

1305
01:24:05.503 --> 01:24:08.108
if you weren't so
fuckin' convoluted.

1306
01:24:44.905 --> 01:24:47.378
I know you think you
lost somethin' in there.

1307
01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:52.581
And this might go in
one ear and out the other.

1308
01:24:52.616 --> 01:24:54.550
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1309
01:24:57.621 --> 01:24:59.357
I don't know what
this money means to you.

1310
01:24:59.392 --> 01:25:04.263
but for me it means that

1311
01:25:04.298 --> 01:25:05.627
when I die...

1312
01:25:09.633 --> 01:25:12.436
...I actually mean
somethin' to my daughter.

1313
01:25:17.641 --> 01:25:20.345
Psh.

1314
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.446
Don't be me. kid.

1315
01:25:37.463 --> 01:25:39.793
Come in on Monday
like everything's normal.

1316
01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:42.862
I...

1317
01:25:42.897 --> 01:25:45.535
-I heard the shot in the back.
-This is not what you think.

1318
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:46.701
-Allison.
-Well. then what is it?

1319
01:25:46.736 --> 01:25:48.802
The bullets are all blanks.

1320
01:25:48.837 --> 01:25:53.840
I'm working on getting you
transferred to another branch.

1321
01:25:53.875 --> 01:25:56.447
where maybe you don't get along
with the manager so well.

1322
01:25:56.482 --> 01:25:59.417
and you can quit.

1323
01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:05.555
Okay.

1324
01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:11.891
You don't think she'll crack?

1325
01:26:11.926 --> 01:26:13.497
She's already broken!

1326
01:26:13.532 --> 01:26:15.466
You did this!

1327
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:16.667
Hey. don't you
wanna silence her?

1328
01:26:16.702 --> 01:26:19.338
Go ahead. do it. do it. do it.
go ahead. you wanna do it?

1329
01:26:19.373 --> 01:26:20.669
You're the only one that can
make hard decisions. right?

1330
01:26:20.704 --> 01:26:22.704
So why don't you do it.
make the hard decision.

1331
01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:33.649
I made a judgement call.

1332
01:26:33.684 --> 01:26:35.486
So did I.

1333
01:26:47.962 --> 01:26:50.897
You hand her the phone.
and we all go to prison.

1334
01:27:04.517 --> 01:27:06.814
My family's never taken
a single thing they didn't earn.

1335
01:27:06.849 --> 01:27:08.354
I'm not starting now.

1336
01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:10.323
That's pride talking.

1337
01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:12.721
This could be
a new start for us.

1338
01:27:16.628 --> 01:27:18.760
Hey. I got no intentions
of spending my final days

1339
01:27:18.795 --> 01:27:20.300
in a jail cell.

1340
01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.532
I gave you the opportunity. sir.

1341
01:27:21.567 --> 01:27:23.369
He's just. uh.

1342
01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:25.602
he's just trying to
keep everyone safe.

1343
01:27:30.444 --> 01:27:31.839
You really shouldn't
have done that.

1344
01:27:31.874 --> 01:27:34.545
Yeah. and we shouldn't
still be here either.

1345
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:38.714
Whoa. hold on.

1346
01:27:38.749 --> 01:27:41.651
Ho--Try and stop me.

1347
01:27:41.686 --> 01:27:44.423
Please.

1348
01:27:44.458 --> 01:27:46.755
When were you going to
let me in on all of these

1349
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:47.723
plan changes?

1350
01:27:47.758 --> 01:27:48.757
Things change. all right?

1351
01:27:48.792 --> 01:27:50.297
What the fuck is going on?

1352
01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.023
What the fuck are you doing?

1353
01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:52.299
Just let him go!

1354
01:27:52.334 --> 01:27:54.334
-And implicate us all?
-Implicate?

1355
01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.863
We're going to
figure this all out.

1356
01:27:55.898 --> 01:27:58.470
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1357
01:27:58.505 --> 01:28:02.705
How did any of you think
this was going to work?

1358
01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:12.913
Just let go.

1359
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:39.511
There is no choice.
just the illusion of one.

1360
01:28:39.546 --> 01:28:41.348
It doesn't matter what we do.

1361
01:29:40.805 --> 01:29:42.772
So maybe we get ahead of this.

1362
01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:47.744
What do you have in mind?

1363
01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:55.719
Let's tell our story before
somebody else tells it for us.

1364
01:29:55.754 --> 01:29:58.623
Migrate what needs
to be migrated.

1365
01:29:58.658 --> 01:30:01.560
get ahead of the market since

1366
01:30:01.595 --> 01:30:03.727
we'll obviously take a dip.

1367
01:30:51.711 --> 01:30:53.106
All of you are victims

1368
01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:55.878
of the most corrupt
bank in history.

1369
01:30:55.913 --> 01:30:57.550
Today is your bailout.
