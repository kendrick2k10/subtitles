00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:39.331
-MAN 1: Surprise!
-

5
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.166
GIRL: Whoo!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.964

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:57.099
-

8
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.173
DANIELA: They see us as girls.
and they just tell us

9
00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.134
that we don't really know
what we're up against

10
00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.386
and we don't know
how to build a chemical company.

11
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:37.306
The chemical companies
that exist right now were made by someone.

12
00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.266
so why can't that someone be us?

13
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.820
I don't know why...

14
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.330
It's marketing. right? Marketing.

15
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.128
I'm a Girl Scout.
All my life. I've been a Girl Scout.

16
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:11.340
Girl Scouts can sell everything.
They sell cookies all year.

17
00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.259
If you're on a diet.
don't worry we have sugar-free cookies.

18
00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.511
You have to sell the cookies.
if you wanna go to camp.

19
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:18.889
I learned don't give up.
keep moving. you know?

20
00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:57.052
STEPHEN: Yesterday. we had
51 different nationalities representing

21
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.888
their countries
as the top student entrepreneurs.

22
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.820
Everybody that comes
to Macau wants to win.

23
00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.488
Everyone is ambitious.

24
00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.157
You know that you have to present
100% of yourself.

25
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.159
and it's all about your execution.

26
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.549
-STEPHEN: And the first place.

27
00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:40.762
GSEA 2019 winner. the award goes to...

28
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.770
-

29
00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.210
We know every single.
like. "in" Latin pop song.

30
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.880
-DANIELA: That's true.
-Because Daniela listens to them all.

31
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.596
MIGUEL: I... I think we probably have
one of the only labs in the US

32
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.476
...what you hear in the lab.

33
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.939
MYRIAM: Like. Daniela will put her.
like. headphones in.

34
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.358
-These. like. big purple headphones...
-

35
00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:38.320
And then. like. you'll. like. walk by.
and if there's no one in the office.

36
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:42.741
-you'll just see her being. like...
-

37
00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.875
So. this is the first reactor
we started with.

38
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.920
It's a proof of concept.
and it's only about the size of my hand.

39
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.297
The solution comes in
with the reactants.

40
00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.966
Reaction happens inside.
and then the products come out.

41
00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:04.346
And then you can just connect
your solar cells to your reactor.

42
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.974
and then you would be powering
the reaction directly with solar energy.

43
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.520
The chemical industry. for years.
has been using heat

44
00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.189
from burning fossil fuels.
to power chemical reactions.

45
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:18.235
But I had a technology where I had proven
that I could make synthetic chemicals.

46
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.694
but with the sun.

47
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.826
Nylon is a 35 billion dollar market.

48
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.788
Chemical companies
that make nylon right now.

49
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.457
they're not necessarily trying
to make it more sustainable.

50
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.627
Every single time somebody
has tried to enter the market.

51
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.087
they just get rid of that person.

52
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:42.843
I have developed a process
to produce key components

53
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:47.305
for nylon in a way that is more efficient.
less expensive. and. for the first time.

54
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.682
it can also be sustainable.

55
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.770
MIGUEL:
I think this is a world-changing idea.

56
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.940
Using solar energy. renewable energy.
to drive chemical process

57
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.108
can really change the world.

58
00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:03.488
Once that was a reality. we thought
maybe we could make this into a business.

59
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.407
So. Myriam and I.

60
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.243
both of us chemical engineers.
no knowledge in business.

61
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.912
joined forces.
and that's how Sunthetics was born.

62
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.750
MIGUEL: Nobody believes
how powerful these girls are.

63
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:19.880
They're not seen as a threat.
although I think they really are.

64
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.454
MYRIAM: There were just. like.
a lot of things

65
00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.010
that we had no idea how to do.

66
00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.095
Like. this is. like. you're talking
to two chemical engineers

67
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.792
-that are. like. you know. like....
-

68
00:06:28.892 --> 00:06:31.683
..."What is finance?"
Like. "What is startup?"

69
00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.228
Yeah. "Who's an investor?
Like. what does that mean?"

70
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.939
I mean. like. look at her. she's so sweet.

71
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.902
We're just two little cute girls.
And no one's ever gonna be like.

72
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.863
"Oh. these girls are gonna. like.
change the chemical industry."

73
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.950
-Just wait for it.
-Yeah.

74
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.744
No. I think you're...

75
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.080
DANIELA: They see us as two girls.
and they just tell us we don't really know

76
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.874
what we're up against and we don't know

77
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.209
how to scale up
and build a chemical company.

78
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.462
But we're gonna prove them wrong.
so. it's okay.

79
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:10.138
-DANIELA: Hola. mami!
-

80
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.807
DANIELA: I grew up in Venezuela.

81
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.688
My mom is a single mom.
She works as a civil engineer.

82
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:22.317
And as I grew up.
I was incredibly happy. I felt safe.

83
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.402
We lived perfectly well.

84
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.700
FEMALE VOICE: Rallies degenerated
into violence.

85
00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:34.704
The near-daily unrest
in Venezuela has culminated once again

86
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.748
in the death of a protestor.

87
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.418
DANIELA:
Our economy absolutely collapsed.

88
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.421
Everything collapsed
in terms of our society as well.

89
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:50.845
I was a student in chemical engineering.
and it became incredibly hard.

90
00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.557
The protests were so bad...

91
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.936
that the government
started targeting students.

92
00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.398
I didn't feel safe.
and I realized that I couldn't stay there.

93
00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.989
I came to the US.
I got accepted into the PhD program

94
00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.157
in chemical engineering at NYU.

95
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.077
And I haven't been back ever since.

96
00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.770
DANIELA: That's the biggest challenge
that I have over here as an immigrant.

97
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.772
The fact that I'm far away.
and the fact that

98
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.441
I live worried about those who I love.

99
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:10.425
STEPHEN: Welcome to the GSEA
National Competition 2019.

100
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.100
So. I want everybody to kinda come in
and then go back deeper. Back deeper.

101
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.436
DANIELA: At the US Nationals.
I remember talking to my mom

102
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.607
on the phone and being like... like.
"This is just a whole new level."

103
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.400
PHOTOGRAPHER: All right. Here we go.
One. two. three.

104
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.194
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Lovely.

105
00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.040
I'm sure all the judges
have never seen a pitch like this.

106
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.708
-the one I'm gonna do.
-

107
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.586
So. yeah. I'm just really excited
to see how they react.

108
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.266
CHRIS: We were in the Nationals last year
and we came in second.

109
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.895
So. we're back here hoping
for. uh. one better of a result.

110
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.320
WOMAN: I think everyone's ideas
are so good.

111
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.280
Of course.
I've got to say mine's the best.

112
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.033
but we'll see who gets
into the finalist round.

113
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.667
All right. We're ready.

114
00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.048
EVAN: Welcome. I'm Evan Sledge.

115
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.093
What we are is a hunting
and fishing guiding service

116
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.512
currently located in Texas and Alaska.

117
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.056
KOBY: My name is Koby Lomax.
and I am currently running

118
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:44.727
a pretty lucrative. a personal brand.
I get comments like this all the time.

119
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.605
"That would be lit if you made
your own hair line though.

120
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.731
"for real. for real."

121
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.694
I had no clue
what they were actually looking for

122
00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.363
or who was gonna win
because everything was just so different.

123
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.408
Bitcoin is the greatest
technological advancement in history.

124
00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.659
behind only the internet.

125
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:04.122
We had people. like. pitching
a very inspiring social works

126
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.957
in. like. India or African countries.

127
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.631
CHRIS:
Cryptocurrency creates a global economy.

128
00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.801
and with Yellow Card.
that economy is open to

129
00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.345
and accessible by everyone.

130
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:21.973
Welcome to the future of money.

131
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.560
We had people like pitching sunglasses.

132
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:29.439
Fifty-five percent of the people
that wear sunglasses actually lose them.

133
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.524
There was so much going on
at the same time.

134
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.401
MAN: You fold them out.
put them on your head.

135
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.236
Now. here's the kicker.
You click the back in.

136
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:36.738
So. now they don't...

137
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.407
You... you can shake. you can do whatever
you want. they won't fall off.

138
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.537
DANIELA: I think the hardest part
was just seeing...

139
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.497
There was the girl who pitched before me.

140
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.291
and when she came out.
her mom was right there.

141
00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.710
And they hugged and they were so happy.

142
00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.130
And I just felt
like a little bit alone. you know?

143
00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.342
So. it was like really.
really tough for me for a little bit.

144
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.968
But. um...

145
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.804
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

146
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:08.311
Oh. wow. I'm so sorry.

147
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.402
MIGUEL: I think one... one of the things
that people don't realize.

148
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.322
Daniela is
under incredible amount of stress.

149
00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.117
The stakes. uh. for success
of the company are very high.

150
00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.620
Not only because of the company itself.

151
00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:29.374
but also because her personal situation
is somewhat attached to it.

152
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.670
If the company were to succeed.
then it's much easier for her

153
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.422
to help her family. uh. back home.

154
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:40.218
But also. there are
some immigration issues. uh. in the US

155
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.888
that. uh. will be easier
if the company were successful.

156
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:51.062
Hello. everyone.
My name is Daniela Blanco.

157
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.315
I am a PhD student
in chemical engineering at NYU.

158
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.192
and I'm also the co-founder of Sunthetics.

159
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.071
Nobody else in the room knows
that you're nervous.

160
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.489
if you don't let them know that.

161
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.576
Making these processes more efficient.
safer and renewable.

162
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.998
You just get up. You take your time.
You fix your skirt. You fix your dress.

163
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.958
And then you walk there like you own it.

164
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:16.963
Producing the very first cost-competitive.
solar-powered nylon chemicals.

165
00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.257
Nobody needs to know

to make the chemical industry clean.
one reaction at a time.

168
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.475
And that. of course. is no easy task.

169
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.353
But I have a loving family
that supports me in the distance

170
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.440

the strength to aim higher.

KUNDA: There's been a long history
of Nepalese migrating abroad.

219
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:37.721
But in the last 20 years.
it's really gone up.

220
00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:42.559
At any given time. about 10 to 15%
of Nepal's 30 million people.

221
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:43.769
is working abroad.

222
00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:47.606
Almost every family. uh.
in Nepal has someone working abroad.

223
00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:50.192
or multiple members working abroad.

224
00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:55.155
This family dislocation. I think is the...
is the hardest part of migration.

225
00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:58.200
The social cost of it is quite high.

226
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:03.747
What he's trying to do.

227
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:08.335
I think. is address the problem of Nepal's
gross national sadness

228
00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:11.630
that comes from migration
and separation of families.

229

When we find out about the hurricane.

244
00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:44.324
we didn't know it was gonna be
so destructive for Puerto Rico.

245
00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:46.368
We prepare ourselves for the hurricane.

246
00:29:46.493 --> 00:29:48.870
but we didn't know
it was gonna be like that.

247
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.796
There was no communication.
We're talking about. we were stuck.

248
00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.840
It's like being in Walking Dead.

249
00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:13.645
ALONDRA: We have a generator.
and we had the opportunity

250
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:17.065
to create bread
and also pastries to give to all

251
00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:20.652
the community because they...
they didn't have water or food

252
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.741
because all the supermarkets were closed
and all the food stores were closed.

Every single person in the family.

My parents encouraged me not to give up

257
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:17.376
and to stay and fight
to better the island.

258
00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:20.879
In the aftermath of the hurricane.

259
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:23.882
I realized the deaf community
was suffering most.

260
00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:25.842
especially from depression.

261
00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:29.971
In all my life. I've been related
to the deaf community

262
00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:31.807
because my cousin is deaf.

263
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.565
I met this woman called Yamilet.

264
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:44.653
She told me that she tried
to commit suicide three times in her life.

265
00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:47.280
But the most sad part is
that she have never

266
00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:50.492
gone to a mental health professional
because the deaf population

267
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:52.911
don't have accessibility
to these services.

"Why is he carrying a baby?

"Is there something wrong with him?"

280

our mascot. Emma. resting right now.

She needs to take a nap. So...

304
00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.887
Babies cry the same. no matter the gender.

305
00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:42.891
the race.
or any other cultural differences.

306
00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:46.770
So. the mother has to register the baby
with some information.

307
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.066
And then at the central screen.
then we only have just one big button

308
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.194
that says tap to translate.
And it's quite easy.

309
00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:57.072
The parent just taps the button
and it starts recording.

310
00:35:57.197 --> 00:36:00.241
And within a few seconds.
we have the result of the translation.

311
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:05.497
First time I went to the clinic
and I saw the babies.

-they're so small. they're like this big.
-

313
00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:10.752
So. imagine if you're a young parent.

314
00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.129
first-time parent.
and they give you a baby like this.

315
00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:16.508

talk about our problems.

324

Right before I finished high school.

328
00:37:12.147 --> 00:37:14.399
my father started becoming ill.

329
00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:18.445
And. uh. his situation
is steady... steadily declining.

330
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:23.533
Situations like this are the ones
that make us know ourselves

331
00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:26.619
and take more responsibility
and stand up.

332
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:30.999
So. right at the moment
when I got in the university.

333
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:32.709
I didn't only have the studies.

334
00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:36.755
me and my brother had
my father's construction business to run.

335
00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:40.008
I always had this experience. so.

336
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:44.262
I had the mother figure. the father figure
of building something on their own.

337
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.516
The feeling of developing
a product out of nowhere.

338
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:51.519
and managing and creating
a sustainable business.

339
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:55.315
was something I always had inside of me.
and I always wanted to try to do it.

340
00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:01.821
JASON: It's. uh. pretty ironic.
a young guy like me

341
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:06.785
not having a baby himself.
creating a solution for young parents.

342
00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:10.163
I don't know if I'm going to be
the best dad when the time comes.

343
00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:13.500
but I'll definitely
be way more experienced

344
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:16.169
because we've read
so many stuff about babies.

345
00:38:16.336 --> 00:38:20.006
Their physiology.
their psychosocial development.

346
00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:24.427
Well?

347
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.304
-MALE INTERVIEWER:
-Swaddle. Okay.

348
00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:52.622
-MIGUEL: I think we should have a toast...
-

349
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:56.501
...to celebrate Daniela's prize. uh.
at the national level.

350
00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:59.754
-And to send her off to Macau.
-ALL: Cheers!

351
00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:02.423
-WOMAN: Cheers. Daniela!

352
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:03.967
MIGUEL:

353
00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:13.017
DANIELA: When you're an immigrant.
it's really complicated.

354
00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:15.270
You find yourself
throughout the entire day.

355
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:16.938
just like. looking at your phone.

356
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:19.440
talking to my mom.
making sure that she's okay.

357
00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:22.110
And even if you try
to just have your entire attention

358
00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.737
on whatever's in front of you.
it's pretty much impossible.

359
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:28.241
Like you always have part of your head
just thinking of something else.

360
00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:29.492
MALE VOICE:

361
00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:31.619
Oh. super. super excited.

362
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.830
Everyone knows. right.
that my mom is coming?

363
00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:35.039
-ALL: Oh!

364
00:39:35.123 --> 00:39:37.208
Oh. you didn't know? My mom is coming!

365
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.671
To have her come in with me to Macau
and to have her at the final competition.

366
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.214
means the world to me.

367
00:39:44.007 --> 00:39:46.426
Not just because of the fact
that she's my best friend

368
00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:48.344
and I would love to have her support.

369
00:39:48.845 --> 00:39:52.098
but also because this is the competition
where I finally get to show them

370
00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:56.019
that I am who I am because of Venezuela
and because of everything I lived.

371
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:05.111
DANIELA:
For me. the US has become my home.

372
00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:06.905
It opened its doors to me.

373
00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.866
The fact that they would let me
represent the US.

374
00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:13.411
especially for me. since I'm an immigrant.
I feel so honored to be able to do this.

375
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.096
MERCY:

376
00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:41.773
HENRY:

377
00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:44.734
MERCY:

378
00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:02.669
MERCY:

379
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.437
MERCY:

380
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:26.401
HENRY:

381
00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.948
HENRY'S FATHER:

382
00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:20.705
ALL:

383
00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:26.169
ALONDRA'S MOTHER:

384
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.477
-

385
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.527
-

386
00:42:59.535 --> 00:43:01.245
MANISH:
Today we are going to surprise Santosh.

387
00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.290
This is actually
our first farewell surprise.

388
00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:12.381
Because Santosh is going to GSEA.
all of his friends are gathered here.

389
00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:15.176
We're telling him that we have
the confidence that you're going to win.

390
00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:17.553
So. make us proud.

391
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:20.973
Please cry out "surprise"
any way you want to.

392
00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:22.266
Surprise!

393
00:43:34.112 --> 00:43:37.156
-MAN: Surprise!
-

394
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.452
-Surprise!
-

395
00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.534
JASON: Most of the times.
there's partying during that competitions.

396
00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:24.120
but the partying happens
after the pitching ends.

397
00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:27.832
In order to party hard.
you have to play hard.

398
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:31.794
So. we'll pitch first. do our best.

399
00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:37.508
and afterwards. when it's all over.
we're going to party really hard.

400
00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:04.869
DANIELA: I still can't believe it.

401
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:07.788
I feel like till the last minute
when my mom was coming.

402
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:10.124
I still felt like.
maybe it's not gonna go right.

403
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:11.626
maybe she's not gonna be able to make it.

404
00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:13.794
But now. I'm so. so happy
that everything worked out.

405
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:31.163
I'm actually the type of person
who gets nervous right before the thing.

406
00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.582
Right now. I feel like everything
is gonna be okay.

407
00:46:33.708 --> 00:46:36.335
but watch me tomorrow
and I'm gonna feel a little bit different.

408
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.007
We're only eight girls competing.
and with seven...

409
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:43.259
-Uh. 52 students.
-STUDENT: 52.

410
00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:47.221
-So. yeah. Girl power.
-Girl power.

411
00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:52.310
JASON: Everybody that comes to Macau
wants to win. but you can't be like.

412
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:55.604
uh. "I'm here to...
I'm here to win the GSEA."

413
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.524
or. you know. "Who are..."
You know. you have to be friendly.

414
00:46:58.607 --> 00:47:00.609
You have to get to know your "opponent."

415
00:47:01.694 --> 00:47:04.613
So. the first day.
is just getting to know each other.

416
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:06.657
Seeing. who am I dealing with?

417
00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:09.076
Which room is he in?
Which room is he in?

418
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:10.619
Is he direct competition?

419
00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:12.705
Is he indirect competition?
What's going on?

420
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.930
Can everybody take their seats?

421
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:35.603
Okay. So. over the next few days.

422
00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:38.689
as you know. tomorrow.
you have the semi-final rounds.

423
00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:43.861
so. you are all going to be competing. uh.
for the Global Student Entrepreneur Award.

424
00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:47.740
But there are also
three other awards this year.

425
00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:02.046
MARISA: Okay. He's stuck at the airport.

426
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:05.424
He goes. "For some funny reason.
don't seem to understand English.

427
00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:08.677
"Tried to explain to them my situation.
and the only thing they keep telling me

428
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:11.138
"is that I have to change
my return ticket today."

429
00:48:11.514 --> 00:48:12.723
JASON: He wasn't allowed to get in?

430
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:16.685
But why? Did he have some issues
with his. uh. visa?

431
00:48:17.143 --> 00:48:18.692
MAN: We're still trying to figure out
what's happening.

432
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:19.688
-Wow.
-Wow.

433
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:21.649
-JASON: Wow. man. That's a bummer.
-Oh. my God. Oh. my gosh.

434
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:23.025
JASON: Wow.

435
00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:37.415
I just talked
to the airport. and.

436
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.501
uh. they said that the main problem.
when he come here

437
00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:44.004
he's supposed to have minimum
5000 Macau money.

438
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:46.257
-but he only bring 2000.
-Mm-hmm.

439
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.467
-Okay. Okay.
-WOMAN:  Yeah.

440
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:52.388
MARISA: Hold on. I have a message.

441
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:21.542
MALE ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen.
welcome to the opening reception

442
00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:24.712
for GSEA 2019.

443
00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:49.820
Immigration has confirmed
they released Henry back to the airlines.

444
00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:52.281
that their procedure is "done."

445
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.493
Um. but we can't get in contact with him.
She tried to call him.

446
00:49:55.618 --> 00:49:58.412
-His phone seems to be off.
-STEPHEN: So. what does that mean?

447
00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:01.790
-Well...
-The airlines have to bring him back to...

448
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.461
WOMAN:
Well. it sounds like he has to leave

449
00:50:05.628 --> 00:50:06.795
-based on...
-Oh...

450
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:08.297
It's not looking good.

451
00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:17.890
The issue is that we can't get to him
in where he is.

452
00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:20.684
and Immigration doesn't let our people in.
There's...

453
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:23.812
-MARISA: Yeah. There's nothing we can do.
-We are not bigger than the government.

454
00:50:35.533 --> 00:50:40.704
So. it's sounding like
they've deported him. Oh. no.

455
00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:46.377
MALE INTERVIEWER:
Why do you think they deported you?

456
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.798
Macau is a gambling city.

457
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:54.426
People come here with money.
I didn't look like I came to gamble.

458
00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:57.054
I look like the gamble itself.

459
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:11.360
...uh. combine that
with my beautiful skin color maybe.

460
00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:12.486
I don't know.

461
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:18.158
HENRY: We had to book a return ticket
back to Nairobi.

462
00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:23.914
But then we also booked another ticket
from Macau to Beijing.

463
00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:25.541
Beijing back to Macau.

464
00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:30.879
If I could prove that I've left Macau
and then come back.

465
00:51:30.963 --> 00:51:32.590
my entry should've been treated

466
00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:36.510
like a new entry. and. this time.
I had the 5000 dollars that they wanted.

467
00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:17.676
Nineteen. 19 are the years
of my life experience.

468
00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:22.222
But before this 19. there's a man who...
who lived in a... in a...

469
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:23.599
-JASON: Again.
-Okay.

470
00:52:24.016 --> 00:52:26.560
Nineteen. 19 are the years
of my life experience.

471
00:52:26.685 --> 00:52:29.480
But before this 19. there's a man
who born in the village in...

472
00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:31.398
off the Nile delta of Egypt.

473
00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:36.654
Here. you can go slower. man.
Now you're talking about yourself.

474
00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:39.823
how your relationship
with your dad made you feel.

475
00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:41.450
-So. you know. I mean...
-MAHMOUD: Oh. yeah.

476
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:44.411
...you... you don't have to stick
to the script 100%.

477
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:47.247
-MAHMOUD: Yes.
-Just think of what's the message

478
00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:51.126
-you wanna sell with the judges.
-Mm-hmm.

479
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.337
JASON:
And. you know. even if you got confused.

480
00:52:53.462 --> 00:52:55.381
just say what you wanna truly say to them.

481
00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:56.924
-MAHMOUD: Yes.
-Own your story.

482
00:52:57.007 --> 00:53:00.260
It's not about the script. It's about
how this whole thing made you feel.

483
00:53:00.386 --> 00:53:02.429
Because that will be
what the judge will remember.

484
00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:03.793
-Yeah.
-JASON: Because. you know. the judges

485
00:53:03.893 --> 00:53:05.683
won't remember what you said.

486
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.686
So. no matter
if you're saying it fast or slow.

487
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:10.688
but they will remember
how you made them feel.

488
00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.356
-MAHMOUD: Yeah. yeah.
-So. if you... if you...

489
00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:13.607
-Exactly.
-MAHMOUD: Yeah.

490
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:15.734
If you hit them with emotion.
then you're good to go.

491
00:53:16.402 --> 00:53:17.820
-Yeah.
-JASON: Okay.

492
00:53:17.903 --> 00:53:19.822
-Let's try again? Yeah.
-JASON: Let's try again. Yeah.

493
00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:23.575
-

494
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:25.452
Thank you.

495
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.501
-MAN: Are you ready?
-BOTH: Yeah.

496
00:53:43.137 --> 00:53:44.471
SANTOSH:

497
00:53:44.596 --> 00:53:46.390
-STUDENT 1: Yeah.
-

498
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.063
SANTOSH: Yeah.

-MALE INTERVIEWER: Okay. Ready.

503
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:25.095
You know how they say
that entrepreneurship

504
00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:28.348
is jumping off a plane
and then building the parachute

505
00:54:28.432 --> 00:54:29.725
while going down?

506
00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:32.478
So. is the entry in Macau for me.

507
00:54:33.562 --> 00:54:37.399
Five countries and four days later.
I do not take being here for granted.

508
00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:41.361
So. to begin. I'd like to say
I am grateful for the opportunity

509
00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:44.823

00:54:51.997 --> 00:54:56.084
At this point.
I've lost so much that... I have to win.

513
00:54:57.461 --> 00:54:59.254
Like. I really do have to win.

514
00:55:56.812 --> 00:55:58.730
One of my mentors. he's from Phoenix.

515
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:03.318
And he told me that I... I need to take
out all of my bad energy

516
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.823
through all my body.
and then go through all my legs.

517
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:11.535
and throw it away.
so I can win new energy.

518
00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:14.997
So. I'm gonna do all that stuff
before I go into the presentation.

519
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.958

00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:48.150
all those competitions are about
how much practice have you done.

Do you know your product?
Have you done your research?

544
00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:54.740
Do you actually know what you're talking
about or you're just here blabbing?

SANTOSH: We present Offering Happiness.

552
00:59:33.779 --> 00:59:36.656

577
01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.696
until the aircraft has come
to a complete stop.

578
01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:00.157
It was great. I think it was great.
I was nervous.

579
01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:04.327
but... for the Q and A part...
...I thought I was like...

580
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:09.082
like 30 minutes because it was. like.
16 questions. I don't know.

581
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:16.506
HENRY:
I was officially deported the first time.

582
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:20.635
And I was so sure that this lady here
at the immigration is going to flag us.

583
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.267
SANTOSH: I did good.

584
01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:31.104
Better than I expected. I was so nervous.
And actually. this morning

585
01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.690
I calmed down in the last hour.
I think that helped me a lot.

586
01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.615
JASON: You get anxious with waiting.

587
01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:46.286
So. while I was waiting.
I was so eager to get inside. and pitch.

588
01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.330
and start talking about what I do.

589
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.957
But. you know. that anxious overcomes you.

590
01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.793
But once you get in there. you know.
say a couple of jokes.

591
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:15.523
HENRY: So. when they stamped my passport
and let me in. I was confused.

592
01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.612
I was like. "What. what just happened?"

593
01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:33.208
Oh. my God.

594
01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:35.919
We made it.

595
01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.587

615
01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.045
-TYLER: So. Henry's here.
-HENRY: Yay.

616
01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:03.131
He made it.
He came all the way from Kenya

617
01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:04.466
-and was...
-MAN: Was deported.

618
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:07.677
Yup. He was supposed to be here.
I think. a day or two ago.

619
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:11.931
and flight issues and immigration.
got held up in immigration...

620
01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:26.237
Everybody. Henry is. uh. from Kenya
and has a business.

621
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:28.198
Is it Roometo Limited?

622
01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:29.949
Very cool.

623
01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:34.746
So. when you're ready. you can start.
I'm gonna start the timer.

624
01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:37.707
And there is a pointer up there.
if you want that. Yeah.

625
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.293
-A what?
-TYLER: You got it right in your hand.

626
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.503

627
01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.845
-Yeah. We can start.
-TYLER: Go ahead.

628
01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:55.308
You know how they say entrepreneurship
is like jumping off a plane

629
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.852
without a parachute
and then building one down...

630
01:04:58.603 --> 01:04:59.646
on your way down?

631
01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.400
Well. that's how it felt
like coming to Macau.

632
01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:05.360
-

633
01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.570
Five countries in four days.

634
01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.907
A plan that had
a 50% chance to fail.

635
01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.577
So. believe me when I say
that I'm truly humbled

636
01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:17.580
and grateful to be here today.

637
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:24.587
In Kenya. we have one million students
enrolled in universities alone.

638
01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:29.884
The total bed space that
these universities have. 280.000.

639
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:34.264
Enter Roometo.
We exist for one sole purpose.

640
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.225
to help university students
and college students.

641
01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:42.647
I needed to try and see...
see the whole thing through.

642
01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:46.151
If I didn't get this closure.

643
01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:48.695
it would have bothered me
for a very long time.

644
01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:08.047
SANTOSH:

645
01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.288
-FEMALE INTERVIEWER:

646
01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:33.466

647
01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.774
STEPHEN: Okay. everybody.

648
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.945
-It's come to that time of the evening.
-

649

-Congratulations. Well done.
-

651
01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:06.457
As you know.
we had seven semi-final rooms today.

652
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.546
We had people arriving from nine o'clock

653
01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:16.342
until the final mad dash from the airport.

654
01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.970
So. a big round of applause
to our final competitor

655
01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:21.472
who finally made it to the country
to be able to compete.

656
01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:27.979

657
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.774

-MALE VOICE: Daniela Blanco. USA.
-

679
01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:20.466
STEPHEN: Daniela Blanco. from USA.
come on stage please.

680
01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.624
HENRY:
I thought. "Okay. maybe I can do better."

681
01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:59.297
But I did my best given what I had.
and given how I was in that state.

682
01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.257
and. you know...

683
01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.803
JASON: If I keep chasing opportunities.

684
01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:09.807
and if I continue believing in myself
and not doubt on the things I'm doing.

685
01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.226
I'll eventually do something big.

686
01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.437
I don't know
if iCry2Talk will be that big.

687
01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.814
I'm hoping it to be.
I'm expecting it to be.

688
01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.567
but if not. you know.
that's what entrepreneurship is about.

689
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:23.070
Even if you fail. you have to try
and do something else.

690
01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.530
You have to continue.

691
01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:34.665
I didn't feel bad because I know that
there was a lot of competition here.

692
01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:37.710
I feel accomplished.
and I feel proud of what I did.

693
01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:42.381
so. I had the opportunity
to share my story. and that was the idea.

694
01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:48.554
I'm so motivated right now.
I really wanna do serious business now.

695
01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.848
Now I'm going to work very seriously.
and I think...

696
01:11:57.146 --> 01:12:01.776
Yeah. I'm surprised. I mean.
my table was like... amazing people.

697
01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:05.988
And now the pressure of representing
200 million people is like.

698
01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.658
it's getting on me.
So. uh. I'm feeling really proud

699
01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:11.202
to represent the Brazilian of today.

700
01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:13.120
Okay. sweetheart.

701
01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:14.956
-DANIELA: Mommy.
-Your mommy.

702
01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:23.524
DANIELA: I was really. really nervous.

703
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:27.570
And I talk a lot when I'm nervous.
but I couldn't talk. so it was even worse.

704
01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:32.783
And. um. we had to learn a lot
about hydroponics. We didn't really...

705
01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.912
I've definitely been much more
of a shy individual.

706
01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:40.833
So. so. telling more of my story's
always been a little bit nerve-racking.

707
01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.586
And sort of pulling back the curtains
on who you are.

708
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:45.922
I think is definitely nerve-racking
for sure.

709
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.757
FEMALE INTERVIEWER:
That's a big challenge.

710
01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.217
So. when we had our first paying customer.
we've also learned...

711
01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.844
ALBERTO: I don't follow a script.

712
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:55.765
Like. following a script
is for actors that don't know their lines.

713
01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:01.354
I am a competitive person.
I do wanna win.

714
01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:04.565
I will be very happy to... to win.

715
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:09.654
So. I'm gonna give 200% up there.

716
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.872
GUSTAVO:
We are trying to say in ten minutes

717
01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.958
a story of seven years of work.

718
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:25.419
So. that's pretty much
what I was trying to fix. you know?

719
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.927
I thought we were gonna be
in the event hall

720
01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:36.472
that we were in yesterday and today.
but this is twice as big. probably.

721
01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:37.640
It's massive.

722
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.938
The stage is big.
There are 16 judges that will be. yeah.

723
01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:45.982
roasting you on stage.

724
01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:56.450
Welcome to the 2019
GSEA Global Student Entrepreneur Awards.

725
01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:08.337
STEPHEN: Yesterday. we had
51 different nationalities

726
01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:12.591
representing their countries as the top
student entrepreneurs in their country.

727
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:14.231
So. I'd like to give
a big round of applause

728
01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.221
for all of the 51 finalists
who made it here to pitch.

729
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.935
STEPHEN: If you join me with a big round
of applause to introduce our first

730
01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.521
student entrepreneur. Eddy Alvarado.

731
01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.112
EDDY: Thank you. everyone.

732
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.284
I come from one of the poorest
and most dangerous neighborhood

733
01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:39.493
in Dominican Republic.

734
01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:44.957
And my family didn't have enough money
to pay. uh. technical institute for me.

735
01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:49.211
So. what I did. I learned all that
I could through self...

736
01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:52.298
-DANIELA: I got this little note.

737
01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:55.468
And the note was from Jorge.
from Colombia.

738
01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:59.930
And he just wrote down that.
you know. that he wished me the best.

739
01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.682
That. you know. like. "Go get them.

740
01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:04.143
Like. you have a story
that deserves to be heard."

741
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:08.522
He wanted everyone in the room
to hear what immigrants go through.

742
01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:11.609
And what South America
is going through. and...

743
01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:16.113
and. you know. how many people
can come from difficult backgrounds

744
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.490
and still make it.

745
01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:21.327
So. it... it was. like. the support
that I needed right before going in.

746
01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:24.330
GUSTAVO: ...uh. and now I am the CEO.
and I have a team

747
01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:26.916
of 70 people working fulltime

748
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:32.213
to transform the reality of education
in a sustainable and profitable way.

749
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.714
In the next 30 months...

750
01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:36.050
DANIELA:
I was born and raised in Venezuela.

751
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.261
so. my heart.
my values are from Venezuela.

752
01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.558
At the same time.
I became an entrepreneur in the US.

753
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.853
They actually made me who I am today.

754
01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:54.777
-Thank you.
-

755
01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.698
STEPHEN: Ladies and gentlemen.
our third student entrepreneur

756
01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.743
is Daniela Blanco. representing the USA.

757
01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:11.043
DANIELA:
I truly believe I'm representing the US.

758
01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:13.963
and everything they do
for immigrants and people like me

759
01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:16.048
who wanna have a second chance
and a real future.

760
01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.968
And. at the same time.
I'm speaking for all those Venezuelans

761
01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.595
who want to show the world
that we're more than a country

762
01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:22.763
in a crisis.

763
01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.600
We're people who have dreams
and who want a better world

764
01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:28.060
for all of us together.

765
01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:35.067
Hello. everyone.
Thank you so much for being here today.

766
01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:38.904
My name is Daniela Blanco.
and I am the co-founder of Sunthetics.

767
01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.615
I was born in tropical Venezuela.

768
01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:44.827
Only daughter to this beautiful lady.
my mom.

769
01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.580
who's unbelievably sitting here
with us today.

770
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:56.213
I think I was four years old
the first time I told her

771
01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:59.675
that I wanted to do science.
But the good kind of science.

772
01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.927
The kind of science that helped people.

773
01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.180
In fact. as I grew up.

774
01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:06.056
I challenged the status quo
of this industry

775
01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.101
to reinvent the chemical industry
as we know it.

776
01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:13.355
And what I want to do is electrify it.
That means using electricity...

777
01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:16.400
...incredibly happy
to license their technology from us.

778
01:18:16.483 --> 01:18:19.403
And the fourth option. it. um...

779
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.615
I actually have some slides on the...
Well. we don't have them. It's okay.

780
01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:27.244
Um. in which 25.000 tons
that will bring the price down...

781
01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.206
Whatever lies ahead of me.
it's not gonna break me.

782
01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:34.084
It's only gonna make me better.
It is gonna make me exactly the person

783
01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:37.713
that I need to be so that.
together with this amazing team.

784
01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.465
I can make Sunthetics a reality.

785
01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:43.928
For your future. for mine.
and for everyone else who comes after us.

786
01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:47.306
-Thank you.
-

787
01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:59.818
STEPHEN: Thank you very much.
Daniela. representing the USA.

788
01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.696
So. while the judges are deliberating...

789
01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.491
-DANIELA: Did you like it?
-TYLER: It was so good.

790
01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:08.035
-I freaked out. I missed a few things.
-Oh. rock... No. You rocked it.

791
01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:09.536
Because the monitors confused me.

792
01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:14.250
My voice. half of it stayed with me
for the entire thing. so. thank you. God.

793
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.712
But. um. uh...

794
01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:28.305
Every time we think we are good.
we remember that we can be better.

795
01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.641
We can... we must strive for perfection.

796
01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:33.394
It wasn't perfect.
but I really did my best.

797
01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:34.728
And I spoke from my heart.

798
01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:43.821
-

799
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:50.536
Okay.

800
01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:58.294
JASON: In Greece. you don't have a lot
of examples concerning the startup scene.

801
01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:04.133
But seeing. like. students my age
being able to dream of changing the world.

802
01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:05.676
I mean. that really talk to me.

803
01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:09.388
If they can do it. I can do it.
I don't see why I can't.

804
01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:18.314
HUSTON: When you're in Africa.

805
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.108
the problems that need to be solved
are fundamental.

806
01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:26.030
On the other hand.
technology is really sort of an equalizer.

807
01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:30.409
All you need is a laptop
and an internet connection.

808
01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:34.830
and you could build something profitable
that solves all of those problems.

809
01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:39.043
-ALONDRA:

810
01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.935
KUNDA: The reason most Nepalis leave

811
01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:00.522
is because of the lack
of job opportunities here.

812
01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:02.858
That is out of desperation.

813
01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:06.195
Basically. there are no young men
left in the villages.

814
01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.654
especially in rural areas.

815
01:21:08.906 --> 01:21:12.659
The most heartening thing to see now.
are startups like these

816
01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:15.746
that creates jobs at home.
and creates happiness.

817
01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:30.094
MIGUEL: A lot of the greatest companies
in the US were founded by immigrants.

818
01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.971
You already took a huge risk
when you immigrated.

819
01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:37.559
uh. so taking risks
to start companies doesn't seem that huge.

820
01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.687
Comparatively. it's a much smaller risk.

821
01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:44.775
HENRY:
Don't give up. There's always a way.

822
01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:50.197
This whole experience proved that to me.
If opportunity won't knock on your door...

823
01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.784
...wall.

824
01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.412
-

825
01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:12.428
STEPHEN:

DANIELA:
I was just getting more and more nervous.

839
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:54.446
And like. the lights.
and you see everyone looking at you.

840
01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.114
and there were so many people.

841
01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:59.868
I was standing next to Dominican Republic.
and I was telling him.

842
01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.579
like. "I don't know. I just feel like.
too nervous and everything.

843
01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:04.206
"Can I hold your hand for a second?"

844
01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:11.838

-Daniela Blanco. USA.
-

848
01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.234
Yes!

849
01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.834
DANIELA:
I couldn't believe it for a second.

850
01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:52.379
I was just thinking like. "Oh. my God.
Like. it actually worked out." You know?

851
01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:54.631
"Like. it happened.
And... And. like. it's me."

852
01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:59.344
Then they brought my mom on stage.
and then I lost it.

853
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:16.713
STEPHEN: So. the GSEA Innovation Award

855
01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:30.704
HENRY:

856
01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.961
But we think we can actually do it.

857
01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:49.890
JASON:

858
01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.960
Hi. Can I get
two pepperoni slices. please?

859
01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.171
Two.

860
01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.264
DANIELA: When I moved to New York.

861
01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:33.642
I wanted to do my PhD
in something that mattered.

862
01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.352
Something that could one day

863
01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.813
become something big
or that was important for the world.

864
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:41.650
But I didn't expect it to be me.
the one who would drive the change

865
01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.944
or who would actually try
to make it happen.

866
01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:56.081
I feel like if I can inspire one person
to fight for their own dream.

867
01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.083
even if you are far away
from your family.

868
01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.335
even if you're dealing
with so many problems.

869
01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:01.586
you can still make it.

870
01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:05.215
What we come from
does not define where we're going.
