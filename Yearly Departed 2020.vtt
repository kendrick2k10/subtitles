4
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.707
-Hi.

5
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.587
-Rachel Brosnahan!
Lookin' good!

6
00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:48.256
(whispering)

7
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.608
(phone vibrating)

8
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.909
(camera shutter clicking)

9
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:16.659
-Mommy's coming.

10
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.620
(camera shutter clicking)

11
00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.915
(chuckles)

12
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.001
(camera shutter clicking)

13
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.491
-Yearly departed....

14
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.828
We have gathered
all you ladies here today

15
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.331
because 2020
was a trifling ho.

16
00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:05.459
And together we are going
to lay this motherfucker

17
00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.920
of a year to rest.

18
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.840
Because 2020 took so
much from us:

19
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:12.925
But I'm here today
to also remind you

20
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.176
that 2020 gave us so much...

21
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.302
-Banana bread.
-Yum.

22
00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:18.514
-Insomnia.
-Yep.

23
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:19.931
And a sixth sense to know when

24
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.558
someone is standing six
feet away from you.

25
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:25.771
BT dubs. six feet equals
one Sterling K. Brown.

26
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.774
-Just happy to be useful.
ladies. Don't mind me!

27
00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.818
Thanks. Ster-ster.

28
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.027
What a chocolate daddy he is.

29
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.612
-He hot.

30
00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:37.324
-While we were all
unproductive slob kabobs.

31
00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:40.911
2020 was out here doing
all of the things.

32
00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:44.206
A global pandemic.
mass unemployment.

33
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.167
worldwide protests.
wildfires.

34
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:49.586
murder hornets.
Megxit. Brexit.

35
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.424
Yes. all of that happened
this year.

36
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.551
This 56-month-long year.

37
00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.305
And although so many
were divided this year

38
00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:03.266
about whose lives mattered
and if wiping down groceries

39
00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.519
was really necessary

40
00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.229
and bitch. yes it was.

41
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:11.483
We did have one common enemy:

42
00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.569
the iPhone Weekly
Screen Time Notification.

43
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.487
I don't need to get
dragged like that.

44
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:19.574
-Thank you. let me live.
-Yeah. Let her live.

45
00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:21.743
-2020...
-(organ plays)

46
00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.454
You were a big ol' dick.

47
00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:28.250
And we are here to tell you
to rest in peace

48
00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:31.086
even though you destroyed
every little ounce of ours.

49
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.629
-Yes!

50
00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.425
-So now. in the spirit
of collective healing.

51
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.093
I'm turning it over to you.

52
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:42.389
to share about what
you lost in 2020.

53
00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:44.599
All right. let's get this year
off our chests

54
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:46.018
and out of our minds. huh?

55
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.144
-Yeah!
-Yes.

56
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.728
-Let's do it.
-Great.

57
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:52.231
First to say a few words
about something dear to her:

58
00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:56.235
please welcome
the iconic Tiffany Haddish.

59
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.362
(scattered applause)

60
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.788
-Thank you.
Thank you.

61
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:10.876
I'm here to bid farewell

62
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.170
to casual sex.

63
00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.966
This is extremely hard
and I apologize

64
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.512
if I have to cut
my remarks short.

65
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.430
I'm still in complete shock.

66
00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:25.807
Utterly devastated.

67
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.519
and so. so horny.

68
00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.230
-Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.233
-Casual sex was my rock.

70
00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:39.404
It was there for me
in my darkest times:

71
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.281
After heartbreak.

72
00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:43.867
After bombing onstage.

73
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.704
After my 10-year
high school reunion.

74
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.622
And I was married then.
It was a casual marriage.

75
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.707
-Amen.

76
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.625
-I'll never forget that feeling

77
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.045
that incredible feeling
of being on top of someone.

78
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.132
feeling that rush of passion.

79
00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.009
staring deeply into their eyes.

80
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.302
and wondering
what is his name.

81
00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:04.930
-Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.223
-But then quarantine happened:

83
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.560
and Casual Sex was
suddenly gone.

84
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.105
Just gone.

85
00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:14.689
They said it would be
a couple weeks

86
00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.108
and I was like. okay.

87
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.610
I thought to myself:
this'll be good.

88
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.112
This is a chance
for me to heal.

89
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.574
get my spirit.
my soul together.

90
00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:27.244
Maybe learn to do the splits
so the next time

91
00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:29.413
I see some... baya.
you feel me?

92
00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.622
Baya!
-Hell. yeah. bitch.

93
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.834
-Maybe in the meantime
I'll join a fuckpod.

94
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.545
The only problem is
once you enter a fuckpod.

95
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.841
you can't leave your fuckpod.

96
00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:44.136
If you leave. you've
got to get a nasal swab

97
00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:45.512
and two weeks
of isolation

98
00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:47.973
before you can even shake hands.

99
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:54.271
Sorry. the word "hands"...
I just...

100
00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.689
It's a lot for me right now.

101
00:05:56.774 --> 00:06:01.235
Cause you know hands.
Big hands. small hands.

102
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.072
I like small hands on a man.

103
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.822
'cause it makes my breasts
feel big.

104
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:08.326
You know what? That's not
what we're here about.

105
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.415
If God forbid you want to leave
your fuckpod for a fuckboy.

106
00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:17.168
you had to ask yourself.

107
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:21.173
are they cute enough for me
to die in about three weeks?

108
00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.509
Possibly.

109
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.845
And I stopped watching TV.
I just stopped it.

110
00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:30.098
Because at this point.
all shows turn me on.

111
00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:31.350
Planet Earth.

112
00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:33.143
Kingdom of Plants 3D.

113
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.771
I love that British
nature man's voice.

114
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:37.980
Is there something
wrong with me?

115
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.358
-No there is not.

116
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.235
-And I don't know
if it's because

117
00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.194
I like the way frogs fuck.

118
00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:46.406
or the way a gazelle rides
another gazelle.

119
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.576
Have you ever watched
crickets do it?

120
00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.954
It's amazing.
-Oh. totally.

121
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:56.290
-And that's when it him me.
Casual sex is not coming back.

122
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:59.586
At first. I was actually
okay with it.

123
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.422
There's something about
men wearing a mask

124
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:06.468
and staying six feet away
that's such a turn on for me.

125
00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.052
-Same.

126
00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:09.512
-Girl. you know what
I'm saying?

127
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.139
I think it's something
about them not talking.

128
00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:13.350
-Yep.
-But that doesn't matter.

129
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:16.019
-Going on a hike without
a face mask is the new

130
00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:18.312
fucking without a condom.

131
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.106
The sad truth is

132
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.987
nothing can fully
replace casual sex.

133
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:29.158
Without it.
I'm a stranger to myself.

134
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.576
Okay?

135
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.411
I don't know who
I am anymore.

136
00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.122
I'm lost.

137
00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:37.331
I got on Bumble. y'all.

138
00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.000
I ended up meeting somebody.

139
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:42.629
He got tested.
I got tested.

140
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:48.218
-I'm in a relationship now.
-Tiffany...

141
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.846
-I promised myself

142
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.514
that I wouldn't do that.

143
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:58.353
I just know that someday.

144
00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:03.317
casual sex...

145
00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.194
and I will meet again.

146
00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:11.949
And this time. I won't
take you for granted.

147
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:17.331
I will let you put
it in my butts.

148
00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:20.834
for two-and-a-half seconds.

149
00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:23.629
And I will pretend to like it.

150
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.425
Until then...

151
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:33.513
casual sex is survived by mutual
masturbation over FaceTime.

152
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.100
and woke conversations.

153
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.851
Thank you so much.

154
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.770
(organ plays)

155
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.277
-Wow.
That was so beautiful. Tiff.

156
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.239
Thank you for
sharing your truth.

157
00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:51.197
-Thank you.

158
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.823
-Of course.

159
00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.784
And I think I speak for
everyone when I say

160
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.413
I'm kind of offended that no one
asked me to join their fuckpod.

161
00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.332
-I'm bouncing between
three fuckpods right now.

162
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.835
-Okay. I don't think that's
how that works.

163
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.544
-Oh. it works.

164
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.339
-Anyway. I think it's important
to remember

165
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.926
that while we said goodbye
to things we'll dearly miss.

166
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:14.596
this year claimed some victims
we're glad as hell are gone.

167
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.639
Like buffets.

168
00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:20.059
And blowing out
birthday candles.

169
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.647
So now. to pay her respects
to something long overdue.

170
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.067
my queen. Natasha Rothwell.

171
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.278
(organ plays. applause)

172
00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:42.957
-We are gathered here today
to say goodbye to TV cops.

173
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.504
TV cops lived in a magical.
beautiful world where

174
00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:52.301
they were the ones
who solved crimes.

175
00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:55.177
How cute.

176
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.974
TV cops lived a simple life.
they were the heroes.

177
00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.976
And only ever occasionally
broke the rules

178
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:04.562
in the name of justice.

179
00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:06.188
They went by many names:

180
00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:09.985
Starsky. Hutch.
Cagney. Lacey.

181
00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.446
-Those little Paw Patrol
assholes.

182
00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:15.407
-Yeah. those motherfuckers.
too. Turner. Hooch.

183
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.159
Sherlock. Even weird. alien.

184
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.787
sexy Benedict Cumberbatch
Sherlock.

185
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.788
-Benedict Cumberbatch
is hot.

186
00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:24.206
-So hot.

187
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.958
-And they came in so
many different pairings.

188
00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:28.044
Big cop. small cop.

189
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.713
Old cop. rookie cop.
Good cop. bad cop.

190
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:31.840
Or as black folks called them.

191
00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.134
bad cop. bad cop.
bad cop. bad cop.

192
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.261
As we bid farewell
to TV cops.

193
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:40.599
we must also bid farewell
to buddy cops.

194
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.184
If you want a cop
to be your buddy.

195
00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:47.438
you have to be a
white teenager with a gun.

196
00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.024
And they'll take
you to Burger King!

197
00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:52.568
- Mmm-mm-mm.

198
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:59.408
The hard part for me is

199
00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:02.828
there were TV cops
that I really loved!

200
00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:06.166
You know. I'll miss
rooting for McNulty

201
00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:09.293
on my 8th re-watch of The Wire.

202
00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:13.130
Even when he was bad.
he was endearing.

203
00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:16.384
Was it his jawline?
I don't know.

204
00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:21.181
And I'll miss loving
Carl Winslow.

205
00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:25.559
Carl Winslow!
2020. ruined Carl Winslow!

206
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:27.645
-Can we keep Carl Winslow?

207
00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.230
-No. honey. no.

208
00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:30.565
They're gone.

209
00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.817
They're all gone.

210
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.320
If I'm gonna be honest.
TV cops. I'm surprised

211
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.947
you survived as long
as you did.

212
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.244
But by the grace of
executive producer Dick Wolf.

213
00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.828
you guys
lasted longer than

214
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.455
"Keeping Up
with the Kardashians."

215
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.539
-Mmm.

216
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:47.915
-With that said.

217
00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.626
I want to extend my deepest
condolences to

218
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.294
recent theater school grads.

219
00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.923
Look. I know you had
you heart set on

220
00:11:56.006 --> 00:12:00.302
making your television debut
as a dead sex worker.

221
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.932
or a doorman. or a doorman
who's also a dead sex worker.

222
00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:07.226
but today. I want to remember
the good times.

223
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:11.648
TV Cops. you always knew how to
make me laugh as a kid.

224
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.610
and you knew how to make me
laugh even harder as an adult.

225
00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.113
Like when one of you said

226
00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:22.033
"If you break the law.
you break the law.

227
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.952
We're gonna
treat everyone equally."

228
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.203
(laughing)

229
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.967
Oh. shit. in retrospect.

230
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.928
that was the funniest shit
I have ever heard

231
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.014
in my Black life.

232
00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:47.142
Where do they
come up with that?

233
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.479
Oh. speaking of
coming up with shit.

234
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.980
now that TV Cops are dead.

235
00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:55.399
network TV is going to
have a void to fill.

236
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:58.110
So I've taken the liberty of
coming up with a few shows

237
00:12:58.195 --> 00:13:01.447
with a different
group of municipal workers

238
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.868
that I think can take
their place...

239
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.160
Mailmen.

240
00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.913
I didn't stutter.
mailmen.

241
00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.664
If there's anyone that needs
propaganda right now.

242
00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.542
it's the U.S. Postal Service.

243
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.711
Phoebe. my posters please?

244
00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:20.926
Can I get a C.
and something up-tempo.

245
00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.720
Ooh. I like that.
All right.

246
00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:27.014
First up in primetime:

247
00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:29.558
"U.S.P.S. I Love You."

248
00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:33.020
Matt LeBlanc plays
a post office cashier

249
00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.981
with dreams of being
a mail carrier.

250
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.860
Mila Kunis. she's
the post office manager

251
00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.111
who falls in love with him.

252
00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.114
All this talk of priority mail.

253
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:46.451
but when are you going
to make me a priority?

254
00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.702
Yeah?
-I'd be in that.

255
00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.371
-For real?
-Yes.

256
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.039
-Okay. making deals!

257
00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.585
Okay. not sure how
the postal workers will appeal

258
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.836
to young. cool audiences?

259
00:13:57.921 --> 00:13:59.630
Well. buckle the fuck up:

260
00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:03.592
Selena Gomez and Zendaya
star in "Going Postal".

261
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.138
Sex. drugs. and
express two-day shipping

262
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.764
in the continental U.S.

263
00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:11.643
Oh. not enough action. you say?

264
00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:13.519
I thought of that.

265
00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:15.355
FedExxx.

266
00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:21.278
Vis Diesel. the only
guns he needs are these.

267
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.238
(applause)

268
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.032
-Brava!

269
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:30.452
-You know. they say
art imitates life.

270
00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.121
but these shows were defunded

271
00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.709
long before the actual
police departments.

272
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.836
After the service. please
join me in the garden

273
00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:42.131
where we will be planting
evidence in TV Cops' memory.

274
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.216
Thank you.

275
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:47.428
(organ plays. applause)

276
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:53.475
-Thank you. for those
powerful words. Natasha.

277
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.812
And thank you to Vin Diesel
for wearing the hell

278
00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.523
out of that mailman uniform.

279
00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.774
Mmm.

280
00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:03.360
And now please welcome
Rachie Brozz Brozz.

281
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.490
(organ plays. applause)

282
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.205
-Thank you. Phoebe.

283
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:19.418
This year. we said goodbye
forever to pants.

284
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.837
Thanks to 2020. our pants
have been tossed

285
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.213
in the great laundry hamper
in the sky.

286
00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.341
-Yes!

287
00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.884
-When there was no longer
a reason to leave the house.

288
00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:29.511
pants lost any reason
to exist.

289
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.639
The one time I put on pants
this year was to prove

290
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.892
to the Postmates guy
I hadn't totally lost my grip.

291
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.476
-Aw.

292
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:39.313
-There were so many good pants:
High rise. low rise.

293
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:42.107
light wash. acid wash.

294
00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:45.778
boyfriend. girlfriend.
harem and assless.

295
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.198
But to really understand what
pants meant to us.

296
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.825
we have to start
from the beginning.

297
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.036
Pants were born at a time
before women

298
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.745
were allowed to wear them.

299
00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:57.874
But like so many
freedom fighters before them.

300
00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:01.461
pants stood up in the face
of inequality and injustice

301
00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:03.254
and broke down barriers.

302
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:07.926
Thanks to Pants we have the
freedom to sit astride a horse.

303
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.010
To ride a bike without
our petticoat getting caught

304
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.346
in the spokes and killing us.

305
00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:15.307
And to lady-spread on the subway
with reckless abandon.

306
00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:16.643
-That's right.

307
00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:18.436
Pants also made it
easier for us

308
00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.188
to run away from predators.
like men and bears.

309
00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.066
Oh. and they had
these cute little pockets

310
00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.817
that were perfect for
holding tiny things.

311
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.778
like our tampons
and our paychecks.

312
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.238
-Yeah.

313
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.282
-Alas. though pants started
off as a feminist statement.

314
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.868
they somehow evolved
into being so skinny

315
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.120
that they cut off
the blood flow to our brains.

316
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:38.123
It's a bad sign when
the best part of wearing pants

317
00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.915
was taking them off at
the end of the day.

318
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.334
-Yes.
-That's true.

319
00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.253
So maybe they had it coming.

320
00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:47.381
And 2020 was
the inspiration that we needed.

321
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.091
Because this is
about liberation.

322
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.176
-Yes!

323
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.929
-Yeah. pants. a world without
you looks different.

324
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:57.015
With the death of pants. we also
lost so many other social norms:

325
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.809
Bras. portion control.

326
00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.479
productivity.
showering regularly.

327
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:04.315
And. of course.
the concept of shame.

328
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:05.775
And to all that I say...

329
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.571
-fuck it.
-(gasping)

330
00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:12.156
To hell with it!

331
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.034
To hell with all of it!

332
00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.828
-To hell with dying my hair.
-Yes.

333
00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.663
-To hell with shaving my pits?

334
00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.499
-That's right.
Let 'em grow.

335
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.501
-To hell with returning text
messages in a timely fashion!

336
00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.421
-Yes!
Yes.

337
00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:28.088
-To hell with paying
my taxes.

338
00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.840
-Ye-- No.

339
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.009
No. sorry. you absolutely have
to pay your taxes.

340
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:33.845
-To hell with pants.

341
00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:35.305
-That's right.

342
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.355
Fuck pants.

343
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.357
-Yes.

344
00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.738
-Fuck pants.

345
00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.617
-Fuck pants!
-Yes!

346
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.536
Yes!

347
00:17:58.619 --> 00:17:59.496
-Fuck pants!

348
00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:03.458
-Ashes to ashes.
dungarees to distressed.

349
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.626
don't cry 'cause they're gone.

350
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.297
Smile. because you don't
have to get dressed.

351
00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:12.217
-Okay.

352
00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:15.761
-Thank you.

353
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:18.222
-That was good.

354
00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.891
Damn.

355
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.101
All right.

356
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:25.814
Thank you. Rachel Brosnopants.

357
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.147
-Boo.

358
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:30.192
-Oh come on. it wrote
itself. I had to say it.

359
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:34.572
Listen. I support you on your
pantsless journey. Brozzies.

360
00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.366
But they do keep
the air conditioner on in here

361
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.368
so you about to be cold.

362
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:42.997
Okay. I feel the dark spirit of
2020 lifting already.

363
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.624
-Shout out to Jesus.

364
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.750
-So to grace us with her wisdom

365
00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:51.422
is my friend Patti Harrison

366
00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.215
who's gonna lay
to rest someone

367
00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:56.510
very. very near to her.

368
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.013
(organ plays. applause)

369
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:10.316
-I am here today to honor
the passing

370
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.193
of Rich Girl
Instagram Influencers.

371
00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:16.614
This is a shocking
loss for their family.

372
00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:19.450
fans. followers. and...

373
00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:24.454
their branded partnerships
with SmartWater.

374
00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:27.750
They were collaborating
on making

375
00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:28.876
a non-reusable metal
drinking straw

376
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.880
for women identifying
cis-women.

377
00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:35.633
And they were going to debut
it at the pop-up party

378
00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.844
for the relaunch of Enron.

379
00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:40.430
I'll be honest: Rich
Girl Instagram Influencers.

380
00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:45.101
I can't tell whether or not you
were in fact "gone too soon."

381
00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:47.979
The number of face-app
smoothing filters you used

382
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.691
made your age
absolutely indiscernible.

383
00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:55.028
You could have left us
very young. yes.

384
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.570
but for all we know.

385
00:19:56.653 --> 00:20:00.032
you could have
been well into your 90's.

386
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.410
Who's the daughter.
who's the mom?

387
00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:06.330
They're both pushing vaginal
rejuvenations. you know? Ha ha.

388
00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:12.377
Regardless. you left behind
an over-exfoliated legacy

389
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:17.925
and a pair of bone-chillingly
huge sunglasses.

390
00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:20.720
But what is to blame
for this tremendous loss?

391
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.556
Was it the global
pandemic shutting down

392
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.558
all their favorite
moisture stores?

393
00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.853
Was it the withdrawal from
not being able to take photos

394
00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:33.523
of sunbeams shining through
their thigh gaps at Coachella?

395
00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:35.943
Was it inserting
"Kombucha-pons"

396
00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.905
before proper clinical
trials could be conducted?

397
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.157
We'll never know.

398
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.911
But what is tragically certain.

399
00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:47.579
is that there was still
so much left on Earth

400
00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:50.124
for them to not learn.

401
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.045
Rich Girl Instagram Influencers.

402
00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:56.463
though we were shocked
at your passing.

403
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.799
it should have come as
no surprise.

404
00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.928
as you've died
many time before.

405
00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:08.558
You absolutely died over
this jumpsuit

406
00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:12.771
you described as
"chic janitor vibes."

407
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:16.233
You died over this serum.

408
00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:21.114
This car your dad or husband.
whatever. bought you.

409
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.365
But let's not focus on death.

410
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.076
Death's not what
funerals are about.

411
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.873
There were so many things
you accomplished in your time.

412
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:34.210
You discovered Italy. Paris.

413
00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:37.171
Up State New York.

414
00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.215
And you were almost always...

415
00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:43.635
-Always on a boat?
-Yes. on a boat.

416
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.346
#boatlife #WomenWhoBoat

417
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.724
#BoatOrDie #BoaterSuppression.

418
00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.602
And who could forget your
deeply surface-level

419
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:55.189
love for photography. which you
tried to get people to start

420
00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.607
calling "Memory Remembering":

421
00:21:57.692 --> 00:22:01.237
A term you coined for you brand
partnership with Fujifilm and...

422
00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:03.071
Enron.

423
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.575
And most powerful of all.

424
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:10.496
Rich Girl Instagram Influencer.
you got involved.

425
00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.624
When protests erupted
across the country.

426
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:16.836
you waited one full day

427
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.880
before posting your
sponsored results

428
00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:21.465
from your belly-smoothing
Skinny Diet Tea.

429
00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:22.759
-Yes.
-Wow.

430
00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:27.721
-Though you may be gone.
your legacy will live on.

431
00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.973
link in bio/swipe up to shop.

432
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:33.644
You're survived by
your children/siblings.

433
00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:35.896
we can't tell:

434
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.776
Beckett. Sailor. Poet.

435
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:45.239
Jamison Neat. and Jaxson
with an X.

436
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:49.618
Now. in your honor.

437
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:52.371
we'll be following
the strict mourning practices

438
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.582
of "Spiritual But Not Religious.

439
00:22:54.664 --> 00:22:57.585
fiscally conservative but
socially liberal."

440
00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:01.463
and together
we will light a candle.

441
00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:04.092
It's from the line of
horse wax candles you made

442
00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:08.429
in partnership with Lululemon.

443
00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:09.721
and Hillary Clinton Hot Sauce.

444
00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:10.932
-I'm with Her.

445
00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:15.685
-And... yeah. Enron.

446
00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:21.567
It has abundance
written on it. it's $190.

447
00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:22.984
-That's a good price.

448
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.028
-No horse wax candles.

449
00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:34.538
Rest in peace. Rich Girl
Instagram Influencers.

450
00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:38.792
May we all say: Namaslay!

451
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.545
ALL: Namaslay.

452
00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.422
-Thank you.

453
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.259
(organ plays. applause)

454
00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:52.013
(sobbing)

455
00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:53.974
Mmm.

456
00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:56.810
-Thank you for that
moving tribute.

457
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:59.480
I haven't been that sad about
a rich white lady's demise

458
00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:01.773
since Dorinda left "The Real
Housewives of New York."

459
00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.108
-Left? Please.

460
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:05.111
Dorinda was fired.
-Mm-hmm.

461
00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:06.695
-I heard she was
hoping for a raise.

462
00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:09.574
-Andy Cohen. pay Dorinda
what she's worth.

463
00:24:09.656 --> 00:24:12.160
-Ladies. ladies.
please. settle. Okay?

464
00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:14.162
-All right.
-And now please welcome

465
00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:16.122
our second Natasha
of the night.

466
00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:18.624
that's Nattie L.. of course.

467
00:24:18.708 --> 00:24:20.917
I'm talking about
Natasha Leggero.

468
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:23.171
(organ plays. applause)

469
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.098
(organ plays)

470
00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:39.561
-Uh. sorry about that.

471
00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.355
Um. Natasha had to step out
for a few.

472
00:24:41.439 --> 00:24:43.356
She's having tiny issues.

473
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:45.942
but she'll be
right here. Okay.

474
00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:47.153
(clears throat)

475
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:52.825
-Mommy! Mommy!
I don't want to be here!

476
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:54.576
-Daddy has Zoom trivia
with his buddies.

477
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.953
and it's illegal for me
to keep you in the car.

478
00:24:57.038 --> 00:24:59.664
so just sit back here with
the iPad and be a good girl.

479
00:24:59.749 --> 00:25:00.708
-I'm hungry.

480
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.626
-Just please. watch Peppa Pig.

481
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.377
If you can do a
convincing British accent

482
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.005
by the time I get back.

483
00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.673
there'll be a bowl of chili in
it for you.

484
00:25:07.757 --> 00:25:09.299
-I hate chili.

485
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:11.801
(organ plays)

486
00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:16.973
-Hi.

487
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:21.354
I am here today to say goodbye
to Having Any More Children.

488
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:24.648
Good-bye to
the painful. messy.

489
00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:27.817
psychologically scarring
event known as...

490
00:25:27.902 --> 00:25:30.238
-having sex with my husband.
-Mmm!

491
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.405
-No one should be having
any more kids

492
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.742
and I say this as someone who
loves a gender reveal party

493
00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:38.496
and guessing what natural
catastrophe it will cause.

494
00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:42.500
By about April of this year.
I was ready to reach down there

495
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:45.044
tie my own tubes.
and double knot that shit.

496
00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.711
-Amen.
-Yes.

497
00:25:46.796 --> 00:25:50.173
-To be clear. it's been
great having this time with

498
00:25:50.258 --> 00:25:54.052
my daughter. Gianna... I hope
I'm pronouncing that correctly.

499
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:56.806
But after being quarantined
with her for eight months.

500
00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:59.808
I've been thinking of sending
back my Wayfair furniture

501
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.478
with a fun surprise.

502
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.396
I love my daughter.

503
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.316
But I love her in
the same way that I love LSD.

504
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.818
In microdoses.

505
00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:12.570
But during this quarantine.
I'm ashamed to say.

506
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.656
there have been times
when I don't like her.

507
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.950
Unless she's sleeping.

508
00:26:16.032 --> 00:26:17.535
in which case.
I forget I have her.

509
00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:20.037
But I didn't sign up
to be a preschool teacher.

510
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:23.249
I didn't have
a baby to teach it.

511
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:26.751
Okay. I had a baby
to get likes on Instagram

512
00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:28.378
just like everybody else.

513
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.505
-What's your baby's handle?

514
00:26:29.587 --> 00:26:31.548
-Just DM me.

515
00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.509
And I'm not just a teacher.

516
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:36.220
Now that she's home
all day every day.

517
00:26:36.304 --> 00:26:38.263
I'm a personal chef.

518
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:42.434
well. I was until I taught her
how to use DoorDash.

519
00:26:42.518 --> 00:26:44.519
But I'm a camp counselor.
a child psychologist.

520
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.188
a gym teacher.

521
00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:49.775
And. on really rough nights.
a sanitation worker.

522
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:52.193
'Cause she shits her pants.

523
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.655
People love to point out
that having a baby

524
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.659
ruins your body.
and don't worry. it does.

525
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:01.578
but it's your mind
that really takes the beating.

526
00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:05.040
Imagine not having to log on to
the Internet to be trolled?

527
00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.542
She makes fun of me constantly.

528
00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:10.796
I fell like I'm living with
a suspended Reddit user.

529
00:27:12.506 --> 00:27:15.509
Sometimes I daydream about
what it would be like

530
00:27:15.593 --> 00:27:17.928
to go through this quarantine
without a child.

531
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:21.222
I'd do social distance
happy hour with homemade sangria

532
00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:23.851
every night.
I'd write two pilots.

533
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:26.811
one comedy. one deeply
affecting costume drama.

534
00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.897
I'd finally learn to paint.

535
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.526
But no. instead. I've spent
my entire quarantine

536
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:35.653
trying to convince a 3-year-old
to wear a mask.

537
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:37.615
She's like a Trump supporter.

538
00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:40.326
Always shouting.
"No Mask! No Mask!

539
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:42.619
Dr. Fauci is a
deep state operative!"

540
00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.289
I used to want to
have more kids but now.

541
00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:48.709
the most I'd do is adopt
a 14 year-old

542
00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:51.921
who is good at crafts
and maybe some light dusting.

543
00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:55.590
It's honestly irresponsible
to have any more kids.

544
00:27:55.673 --> 00:27:56.925
I mean. what
are they inheriting?

545
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.010
A sinking planet?

546
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:01.012
Toxic air?

547
00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:02.515
A "Fresh Prince" reboot?

548
00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:05.518
-Mommy. I'm bleeding.

549
00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:07.685
-Ugh.

550
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:10.772
Always bleeding. all right.
I have to go.

551
00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:13.192
(organ plays)
-I'm coming.

552
00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.903
What is in your mouth?

553
00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.990
-God.

554
00:28:20.074 --> 00:28:23.618
And I glad I invested in an IUD.
-Same here.

555
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.288
-Anyway. I know
there's someone here

556
00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:28.499
who can unite us with
her brilliance.

557
00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:31.419
and that is Ziwe.

558
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.837
-Woo!
-(organ plays. applause)

559
00:28:35.297 --> 00:28:36.714
-Yes!

560
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:44.682
-Today we say goodbye to the
era of the beige Band-Aid.

561
00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:47.476
Beige Band-Aids were born in
Highland Park. New Jersey

562
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.978
in 1920.

563
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.690
Conceived by Earle Dickson.
the Band-Aid only came in beige

564
00:28:52.772 --> 00:28:56.402
because the 1920's were
famously safe for Black people

565
00:28:56.484 --> 00:28:57.653
-Ha-ha.

566
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:58.988
-Famously.

567
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.865
But this year was different.

568
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:02.866
As protests against
police violence

569
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.451
erupted across the nation.

570
00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:06.578
our friends at the
Band-Aid corporation.

571
00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:08.497
and so many corporations

572
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.625
stood up and declared with
a loud. triumphant voice.

573
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.628
"Fine. Here."

574
00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:17.173
Isn't it nice?

575
00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:19.758
We asked for equality and
we got a brown Band-Aid.

576
00:29:19.842 --> 00:29:23.554
A little brown Band-Aid
on a systemic bullet hole.

577
00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:25.513
-Pass the plate because
this is a sermon.

578
00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:26.557
-Mm-hmm.

579
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.267
-We must also pay our respects

580
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:30.269
to all of
the civilian casualties

581
00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:31.979
that the death of
the Beige Band-Aid era

582
00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:35.191
took with them now that
corporate racism isn't allowed:

583
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:37.609
Aunt Jemima. Uncle Ben.

584
00:29:37.692 --> 00:29:39.444
Chief Wahoo. Trader Ming

585
00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:41.864
and the nameless
Native American butter girl.

586
00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:45.366
Thankfully. Aunt Jemima's
legacy will live on

587
00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:47.702
in an Oscar-nominated film
about her life.

588
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.163
starring an all-white cast.

589
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:50.663
(laughs)

590
00:29:50.748 --> 00:29:53.083
-Now along with these
new diverse Band-Aids

591
00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:56.336
came a tidal wave of
performative bullshit

592
00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.507
from corporations
and suddenly everyone

593
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:02.218
was apologizing for
massive blindspots

594
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.969
about their unchecked racism.

595
00:30:04.053 --> 00:30:06.513
Networks purged
blackface from every beloved

596
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:08.473
sitcom from the past 15 years.

597
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:11.268
There's also Washington D.C.'s
newly named

598
00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:12.644
"Black Lives Matter" plaza.

599
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:14.438
-Oh. I was stopped
and frisked there.

600
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:15.772
-Same here.

601
00:30:15.855 --> 00:30:18.025
-In the post-beige
Band-Aid world.

602
00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:20.528
apologizing became the norm.

603
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:22.028
Celebrities apologized for

604
00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:24.448
their accidental plantation
weddings.

605
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:28.117
even though plantation was right
there in the name of the venue.

606
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.787
-Thank you.

607
00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:32.373
-I didn't realize the
era of the beige Band-Aid

608
00:30:32.455 --> 00:30:35.459
had died until I started
getting a flurry of texts

609
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:38.170
from my former co-workers
expressing their own apologies

610
00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:40.297
for various slights.

611
00:30:40.381 --> 00:30:42.215
I truly had no idea that
that many white people

612
00:30:42.298 --> 00:30:46.010
had my phone number.
and that's on me.

613
00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:50.223
The era of the
beige-only Band-Aid is gone.

614
00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:53.269
and all it took was
a literal 100 years.

615
00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.061
-100 damn years.

616
00:30:55.144 --> 00:30:58.356
-So. thank goodness we now
have a Band-Aid in the shade

617
00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.857
of Naomi Campbell...

618
00:30:59.942 --> 00:31:00.984
-Nice.

619
00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:02.361
-Iconic.

620
00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:03.862
Thank you.

621
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:08.866
(organ plays)

622
00:31:11.077 --> 00:31:12.579
-Wow.

623
00:31:12.663 --> 00:31:14.414
Thank you so much. Ziwe.

624
00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:16.208
-You're welcome.

625
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:18.210
-Okay. well. without
further ado.

626
00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:21.046
it is my pleasure
and my honor--

627
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.632
Oh my God. I'm getting chills
just thinking about it.

628
00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:28.011
--to bring up the great.
the legendary.

629
00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:30.221
Sarah Silverman.

630
00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:32.016
(organ plays. cheering)

631
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:42.526
-Hello. friends.

632
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:46.070
We're gathered here this
evening to bid farewell

633
00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:48.574
to Making America Great Again.

634
00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:50.116
-Woo!

635
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.869
-You were a concept.
a political agenda.

636
00:31:52.952 --> 00:31:55.663
a slogan on a hat
made in China.

637
00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:59.417
So let's take a moment
of silence.

638
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.377
Moment over.
All right. Judy.

639
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:04.256
(music plays)

640
00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:05.465
(cheering)

641
00:32:11.971 --> 00:32:13.766
-All right. cut it. Judy.

642
00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:15.017
(music stops)

643
00:32:16.393 --> 00:32:18.186
-Farewell Lil' MAGA.

644
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:21.230
It's high time we lay
you the fuck to rest.

645
00:32:21.315 --> 00:32:23.567
(cheering)

646
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:25.818
Can you imagine what
George Washington would say

647
00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:27.863
if he saw America right now?

648
00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:31.991
He'd be like. what's a toilet?
Why do women have bank accounts?

649
00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:34.286
What's a car?
Where are all the horses?

650
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:36.704
Where's Martha. is she dead?
What's a phone?

651
00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.749
Salad in a bag?

652
00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:42.836
This country's really changed
since its inception.

653
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.590
MAGA. it's hard to pinpoint
exactly when you were born.

654
00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:50.426
In recent history.
I'd say it started

655
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.971
when a nice lady from Alaska
shot moose from a helicopter.

656
00:32:54.056 --> 00:32:55.848
And people loved it.

657
00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:58.852
You started really
walking when racist chodes

658
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:03.356
accused the first black
president of being from Kenya.

659
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.567
And then you moved right
into that Oval Office

660
00:33:05.651 --> 00:33:08.612
when the electoral college
decided they'd rather

661
00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:12.324
roll the dice on a failed casino
mogul than vote for a woman.

662
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:16.912
We never saw you coming.
and by "we".

663
00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:18.705
of course I mean
white liberals.

664
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:21.375
I'm not just here
to criticize you.

665
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.376
I admired a lot about you.

666
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.128
You were a noble goal.

667
00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:27.338
I mean who doesn't
want to be great?

668
00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:30.174
You promised a wall
and you made one

669
00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:32.885
out of strong metal cages
with toddlers inside.

670
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:37.891
You touted law and order and
you teargassed moms in Portland.

671
00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:40.394
You wanted to make
Americans richer.

672
00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:41.644
And you did that!

673
00:33:41.729 --> 00:33:43.896
As long as they
were already rich.

674
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.481
But I gotta be honest.

675
00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:47.942
When I close my eyes and
picture "great."

676
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:51.028
I don't see gumming up
the U.S. Post Office

677
00:33:51.113 --> 00:33:53.531
to keep people from voting or

678
00:33:53.615 --> 00:33:56.410
paying less in taxes than
you paid for your TOTO toilet...

679
00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:57.952
-Hell no.

680
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:01.957
-And MAGA. I admired your
commitment to diversity.

681
00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:05.794
It didn't matter whether
someone was a disgraced lawyer

682
00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:08.005
or a disgraced CEO.

683
00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:10.298
or even a disgraced
white nationalist.

684
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:12.259
to make America great again.

685
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:15.429
they all had a seat
at the table.

686
00:34:15.512 --> 00:34:17.472
And you're responsible
for some of

687
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:18.849
the funniest jokes.like.

688
00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:21.351
"Mexico will pay
for the border wall"

689
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:24.938
and "The virus will
disappear by April."

690
00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:27.608
and that prank you pulled
on Herman Cain.

691
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.818
Wow. Just wow.

692
00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.278
And with your passing.

693
00:34:32.362 --> 00:34:35.239
there are so many
more goodbyes to say.

694
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:39.036
Goodbye to the idea that
education is indoctrination.

695
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.496
-Yes!

696
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.206
-Goodbye to the fear
that at any moment.

697
00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:45.291
the nuclear codes could
wind up on Twitter.

698
00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:46.835
-Hell. yeah.

699
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:50.422
-Goodbye to the idea that
your opinion is science.

700
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.048
-Yes.

701
00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:54.760
-Life will improve for so many
in a post-MAGA world.

702
00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:58.137
Endangered species.
democracy.

703
00:34:58.222 --> 00:35:00.306
Infrastructure.

704
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:02.601
Black and indigenous
people of color.

705
00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:05.436
LGBTQIA+ peeps.

706
00:35:05.521 --> 00:35:09.608
Jews. Whoops. guess we
are gonna replace you.

707
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.985
But not until we get a handle
on controlling the weather.

708
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.989
So to making America
great again.

709
00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:20.077
we say. adios because we know
how much you'll hate that.

710
00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:22.246
You know. it turns out.
you can't make something

711
00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:25.666
great again if it wasn't
great to begin with.

712
00:35:25.748 --> 00:35:28.251
When was this "again?"
anyway.

713
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:32.255
Was again when black people
weren't allowed in certain towns

714
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:34.007
after sundown?
-No.

715
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.177
-Was it back in 2002 when
it was still illegal in Texas

716
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.347
to perform and receive
anal sex?

717
00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:43.266
Up until the 70s. women couldn't
apply for a bank account

718
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:44.768
without a man's permission.

719
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:47.436
Thank you. Justice Ruthie.

720
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:49.356
Sure. there have been
great things about us:

721
00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:52.400
Of course there have been
great things about us.

722
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:55.237
Purple mountains majesty.

723
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.699
Um. Costco.

724
00:35:58.782 --> 00:36:01.827
24 hour dry cleaning.
Dolly Parton.

725
00:36:01.909 --> 00:36:03.286
-She's great.

726
00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:05.329
-Gun ranges next
to liquor stores.

727
00:36:05.414 --> 00:36:06.748
-That is a thing.

728
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.001
-But now we've taken
off the red hat.

729
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.961
and it's our job to climb out
from under the rubble.

730
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.088
and the wreckage of
what's left of our country.

731
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:18.175
and just...
just make America good.

732
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:22.097
Because we can be good.

733
00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:26.059
Despite what the past four
to 300 years have taught us.

734
00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:28.561
it's not too late.
-Yes.

735
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:30.438
-Maybe this is because
I'm high. I don't know.

736
00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:33.317
but we've gotten
through so much.

737
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.152
And we've gotten through it
with grit and resilience

738
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.280
and porn that's specific
to our needs.

739
00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:39.780
-Hell. yes.

740
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.451
-I know we have it in
us to Make America Good.

741
00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:44.369
-Say it.
-Preach.

742
00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:45.996
-I've seen us be good.

743
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.123
How during this
fucking awful year.

744
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.291
we showed up for each other.

745
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:53.085
When we marched in
peaceful protest.

746
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.755
When we helped our neighbors.

747
00:36:55.838 --> 00:36:58.675
When we got on our fire escapes
and banged our pots and pans

748
00:36:58.759 --> 00:37:00.635
for the frontline workers

749
00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:03.429
in a collective.
shared primal scream.

750
00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:04.514
-Yeah!

751
00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:07.601
-Because goodness is greatness.

752
00:37:07.684 --> 00:37:11.271
So we'll move on from
the MAGA era stronger.

753
00:37:11.355 --> 00:37:13.023
-Yes.
-And wiser.

754
00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.231
-Yes!

755
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.025
-And one step closer
to deleting Facebook.

756
00:37:16.108 --> 00:37:17.360
-Amen.

757
00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:20.655
-Because this is America.
goddamnit.

758
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.407
And are we the
greatest country in the world?

759
00:37:23.492 --> 00:37:24.826
No.

760
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.788
But are we the biggest?

761
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:29.331
Also no.

762
00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:31.375
But we are the craziest.
and that's not nothing.

763
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:32.708
-Woo!

764
00:37:32.793 --> 00:37:36.672
-And so I stand before
you today hopeful.

765
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.507
Because when I look out
at this crowd.

766
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.219
I see women in this
room who have made us

767
00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:45.179
feel a little bit better.

768
00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:49.184
And it reminds me.
we're in this together.

769
00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.686
-I got your backs.
I got your backs.

770
00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.146
I got all your backs.
-Wahoo.

771
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.648
-Because...

772
00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:56.983
what was I saying?

773
00:37:57.067 --> 00:38:00.362
-America?
-I was?

774
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:01.905
Oh. okay.

775
00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:04.532
Well. sayonara 2020.

776
00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:07.619
I hate to see you leave but
I love to watch you go.

777
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.869
(cheering)

778
00:38:09.663 --> 00:38:11.873
(organ plays)

779
00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:20.923
-Well. ladies. we did it.

780
00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:22.800
-Woo.
-Yes.

781
00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:25.387
-We have said goodbye
to so much here today.

782
00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:30.224
But as I look around this room.
I don't feel a sense of loss.

783
00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:34.061
2020 tried to break us.
but today.

784
00:38:34.146 --> 00:38:36.565

-Yeah!
-Woo!

789
00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:46.240
-So in closing. thank you.

790
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:50.704
Thank you for helping us
put this year to rest.

791
00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:51.829
I needed it.

792
00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:54.416

793
00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:59.420
