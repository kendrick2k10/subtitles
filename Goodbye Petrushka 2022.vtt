3
00:02:09.988 --> 00:02:12.840
you'd cling to your joke of a
career until the sun goes out.

4
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.750
But let's not kid ourselves.
you had your 15 minutes.

5
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.473
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

6
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.400
Bonsoir. mon ami.

7
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.683
Just thought I'd stop by.

8
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.390
Well. enough chit chat.

9
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.410
You know why I'm here. Thibaut.

10
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.243
Do I?

11
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.910
As president of the skating union.

12
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.520
having to tell those past their prime

13
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.050
that they're past their prime

14
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.890
is one of the least
saddest parts of my job.

15
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.923
Saddest. I meant saddest. What did I say?

16
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.750
Are we done?

17
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.370
Let's be clear here. Frenchie.

18
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.940
I strongly advise you to end
your skating career yourself.

19
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.670
ASAP. because if you don't.

20
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.723
I will personally make sure you regret-

21
00:03:57.723 --> 00:03:58.973
Oh shit. the soup.

22
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.850
So as I was saying. I
will personally make sure

23
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.092
that you regret-
Here. hold this.

24
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.300
What was I saying?

25
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.210
Thanks.
Yeah. uh-huh.

26
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.190
Look. there. there's no
need to tell me all this.

27
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.223
See. I disagree.

28
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.013
If it were up to you.

29
00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:31.730
you'd cling to your joke of a
career until the sun goes out.

30
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.020
But let's not kid ourselves.
you had your 15 minutes.

31
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.410
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

32
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.963
You are old news. And old news
goes out with the garbage.

33
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.333
You see this soup?

34
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.343
Well. you can't have any.

35
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:16.738
Oh. what a beautiful thing

36
00:05:16.738 --> 00:05:18.988
To leave a gloomy place

37
00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:22.879
For Paris. beautiful Paris

38
00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:26.720
which love must have created one day

39
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.203
Oh. ffff-

40
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.453
Most film teachers think mainstream.

41
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.790
but those teachers are
not Professor Steve.

42
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.040
See. Professor Steve thinks visionary.

43
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.450
And that is why we're going to skip over

44
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.680
these very nice mainstream folks.

45
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.900
And instead focus on the works

46
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.463
of one quietly brilliant modern master:

47
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.299
Professor Steve.

48
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.603
Sorry.

49
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.043
Actually. dudes and dudettes.

50
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.070
Professor Steve has changed his mind.

51
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.420
Let's all break out our short
scripts we wrote last week

52
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.880
because it's time for
another rousing round of

53
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.370
peer

54
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.073
critique.

55
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.750
Hmm.

56
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.940
Now. of course. we don't have
time to critique everybody.

57
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.110
So instead. let's just
spotlight one very lucky person.

58
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.483
Claire. how about you?

59
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.960
Now. remember. people. we are
not here to attack Claire.

60
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.960
but to guide her. to inspire
her. to shape her as a writer.

61
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.303
Wilson?

62
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.460
Yeah. so. Claire. this
isn't to attack you.

63
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.870
but to inspire you and
shape you as a writer.

64
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.743
Um. I just feel like
your script didn't. like.

65
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.983
convey the human experience.

66
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.000
That's because it's
about a talking tapeworm.

67
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.180
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

68
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.123
This is not an arguing space.
this is a growing space.

69
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.623
Wilson. please continue.

70
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.740
And quite frankly. it
could use more minorities.

71
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.666
Ooh.

72
00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:53.335
Ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh.

73
00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:54.270
Mm. mm.

74
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.638
Unpack that for me. Yes.

75
00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:01.700
I felt that there was a lack
of a true political voice

76
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.760
from the tapeworm.

77
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.162
I found that deficit to be. frankly. sad.

78
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.170
I feel like the tapeworm comes
from a place of privilege.

79
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.157
Is the tapeworm willing to
examine his privilege. Claire?

80
00:08:15.157 --> 00:08:16.260
I mean.

81
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.093
I just feel like a tapeworm

82
00:08:17.093 --> 00:08:19.320
wouldn't say this stuff in real life.

83
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.872
Unpack that for me.

84
00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:23.640
Okay. everybody.

85
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.330
Thank you. thank you. Very rich remarks.

86
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.480
Now. for your next assignment.

87
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.910
you are going to make your own films.

88
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.713
Yes. that's right. you're
going to make art. art.

89
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.793
Like Professor Steve before you.

90
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.430
Only not as good.

91
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.390
I figured out my film
genre: puppet Greek tragedy.

92
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.580
So it'll be "Oedipus." but with puppets.

93
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.910
I call it: "Oedipuppet."

94
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.010
Oh. so cute.

95
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.843
Can I be in it?

96
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:56.643
Yeah. actually. I was
thinking of you for Oedipus.

97
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.740
Oh my God. Claire.
doesn't he murder his dad.

98
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.060
and have sex with his mom. and
gouge his eyes out. and die?

99
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.220
Yeah.

100
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.450
Cute. I'm in.

101
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.750
Seriously. though. can't
believe your professor

102
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.878
signed off on this.
how'd you convince him?

103
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.200
Whoa. Claire. did you even tell him?

104
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.400
Oh my God. don't you
care about your grade?

105
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.340
Mm. he'll come around.

106
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.550
or not. And I'll get an F.
and flunk out of college.

107
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.340
and spend the rest of my
life cleaning toilets.

108
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.840
Ew! Don't talk about
toilets. toilets are gross.

109
00:09:28.104 --> 00:09:29.373
You know what you need?

110
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.190
Get laid?

111
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.120
No. but yes. but I mean realistically.

112
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.030
you need to go to Paris.

113
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.420
I can't just drop
everything and go to Paris.

114
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.900
Sure you can. Claire.

115
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.200
Like. all you've ever talked
about since middle school.

116
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.290
is the poems of Apollinaire.
the history of the catacombs.

117
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.180
the entire "AstÃ©rix" series.

118
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.200
No wonder you're still a virgin.

119
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.740
You are very loud.
But. seriously.

120
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.560
you've worked so hard for this.

121
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.930
You literally taught yourself
French when you were a kid.

122
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.763
You should go.

123
00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:01.350
We should both go.

124
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.150
make it a party.

125
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.780
Unlike you. I would have to withdraw

126
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.100
my entire college fund in order to go.

127
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.104
So what?

128
00:10:08.104 --> 00:10:10.083
It's not like you're getting
anything outta college.

129
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.951
It's a crazy idea. though.

130
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.290
We don't even know anyone in Paris.

131
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.800
Sure we do. my Uncle Antoine lives there.

132
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.050
Really?
Mm-hmm.

133
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.180
Yeah. he's the head

134
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.560
of like this puppet conservatory in Paris.

135
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.880
Your uncle is the head

136
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.607
of Le Conservatoire de la Marionnette.

137
00:10:31.607 --> 00:10:33.117
and you never told me?

138
00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:34.393
You never asked.

139
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.640
Well. I just need to
get through this class

140
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.700
and this professor. and
then I'll figure it out.

141
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.620
Follow your gut. Claire.

142
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.990
If you wanna go to
Paris. then go to Paris.

143
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.160
If you wanna make Oedipuppet.
then make Oedipuppet.

144
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.340
because life is far too short

145
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.343
and true passion is far too rare.

146
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.830
How did you get so wise?

147
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.680
I talk to Yoda.

148
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.560
He lives in my closet.
and when I touch his hand.

149
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.320
I ask him questions.
and he gives me answers.

150
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.010
Maybe I should try it sometime.

151
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.060
Yeah. but you should
probably get your own.

152
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.080
I don't let just anybody touch my Yoda.

153
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.653
He's in his original box.

154
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.080
Okay. let's do one last take.

155
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.040
Oedipuppet. gouging out
the eyes. take four.

156
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.580
Roll camera

157
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.670
and

158
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.795
action.

159
00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.710
Oh ye gods!

160
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.390
I am ruined!

161
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.320
For my wretched sins

162
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.488
I rip out mine eyes!

163
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:58.640
For my wretched sins

164
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.687
I rip out mine eyes!

165
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.410
I'm sorry. Claire. I
can't raise your grade.

166
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.960
To do so would be to compromise

167
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.590
the rigorous standards of Professor Steve.

168
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.600
I didn't ask you to raise my grade.

169
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.490
I asked why you're saying
my work isn't honest.

170
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:36.023
Oh. Claire. Claire. Claire.
Claire. Claire. Claire.

171
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.720
How do I explain honesty?

172
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.860
Honesty is real

173
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.120
and honest.

174
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.000
You saw Wilson's movie today. right?

175
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.110
Now that was an honest work.

176
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.420
a heartfelt account of
his turbulent upbringing

177
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.773
as a Cambodian child under
the merciless Bic Pen regime.

178
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.730
You do realize Wilson is a lacrosse player

179
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.223
from Greenwich. right?

180
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.600
And

181
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.433
white.

182
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.670
Professor Steve chooses to ignore you.

183
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.270
Well. if I can't raise this grade.

184
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.270
I'm just worried about my GPA because...

185
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.883
Wait a second.

186
00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:18.900
No. I'm not.

187
00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:20.849
I'm not.

188
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.623
I'm just not.

189
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:26.580
Excuse me a second.

190
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.653
I need to call Yoda.

191
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.930
Julia. ask Yoda if we should go to Paris.

192
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.630
Ooh. yay. hang on a sec.

193
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.777
Yoda says. "For 800 years.
have I trained Jedi."

194
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.167
Good enough for me!

195
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.853
Your application is adequate.

196
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.207
Now. tell me why you wish to
work as an au pair in Paris.

197
00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.590
Okay. Well. uh. I've never been to France.

198
00:14:38.433 --> 00:14:41.648
but what I've always
wanted more than anything

199
00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:43.098
is to live in Paris

200
00:14:44.186 --> 00:14:45.786
So... I think this job

201
00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:49.908
can help me get to know
Parisian culture better.

202
00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:53.134
You speak French perfectly!

203
00:14:53.134 --> 00:14:54.809
Thank you! I'm. uh. I'm -

204
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.830
I'm half Belgian.

205
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.010
Yes.

206
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.400
Well. even so.

207
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.810
Anyway. some family in
Paris will be very lucky

208
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.830
to have you for an au pair.

209
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.053
So. welcome to Babysitting Paris!

210
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.490
Ah.

211
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.010
but a word to the wise.

212
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.429
Some families don't particularly like it

213
00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:21.839
when their au pair is
as well-educated as you.

214
00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.664
It can threaten their
fragile sense of superiority.

215
00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:27.979
So. you can't be too careful. you know?

216
00:15:29.173 --> 00:15:30.006
Wait. um. what did you ...

217
00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:31.680
Great. it's settled then.

218
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.479
Welcome to Babysitting Paris.

219
00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.225
That is...

220
00:15:37.158 --> 00:15:39.334
...if that's truly what you want.

221
00:15:39.334 --> 00:15:41.459
This is the kind of decision that can

222
00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:42.659
come back to haunt you.

223
00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:44.578
if you see what I'm saying.

224
00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:46.060
My God...

225
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.790
To look at your young face

226
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.133
and your supple. youthful skin.

227
00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:55.589
...knowing full well that
in three months' time

228
00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:57.243
you'll come back prematurely aged

229
00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.826
and wrinkled like a prune.

230
00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:00.367
with a permanent twitch.

231
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.522
Uh. sorry. would you mind repea--

232
00:16:03.522 --> 00:16:04.780
I didn't say anything.

233
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.520
Right. so I have other applicants to see.

234
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.670
how will you be paying?

235
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.783
Excuse me?

236
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.110
You. you dropped this.
this receipt from. uh.

237
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.899
Babysitting Paris.

238
00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:28.171
Oh. thank you.

239
00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:29.548
You...

240
00:16:29.548 --> 00:16:31.170
You speak French?

241
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.003
Uh. yes!

242
00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:34.327
Are you French?

243
00:16:35.217 --> 00:16:36.647
No. but...

244
00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:38.783
I'm going to France next week.

245
00:16:38.783 --> 00:16:39.968
It's my first time.

246
00:16:39.968 --> 00:16:42.304
How about you? Are you from France?

247
00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:43.816
Yeah. from Lyon.

248
00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:45.732
Lyon! That's where Guignol is from.

249
00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:49.298
How do you know about Guignol?

250
00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:52.810
Funny for an American to
know about a French puppet.

251
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.166
Well. uh. I like puppets!

252
00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:55.044
I do too.

253
00:16:55.044 --> 00:16:56.727
I mean. when you're from Lyon

254
00:16:56.727 --> 00:16:58.411
It's pretty much required.

255
00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:00.355
You live here in New York?

256
00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:01.645
Yeah.

257
00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.221
Well...

258
00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:04.908
...not anymore. after this week.

259
00:17:04.908 --> 00:17:07.124
But I did live here. for four years.

260
00:17:08.053 --> 00:17:09.907
I was training for figure skating.

261
00:17:09.907 --> 00:17:11.543
Oh. you skate?

262
00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:12.454
Yeah.

263
00:17:12.454 --> 00:17:13.287
I mean...

264
00:17:14.374 --> 00:17:15.627
No.

265
00:17:15.627 --> 00:17:18.444
Well. actually... it's complicated. but...

266
00:17:18.444 --> 00:17:20.289
...oh. that's my ride.

267
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.789
- Ah. Oh. no.
- Um.

268
00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:24.336
Oh. okay.

269
00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.754
Uh.

270
00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:27.870
...See you soon!

271
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.780
Okay. Paris question.

272
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.430
Where do you think is
best to rent an apartment:

273
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.630
La Rive Gauche or La Rive Droite?

274
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.670
Of course. La Rive Gauche is
associated with bohemians.

275
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.550
so that might be kind of iffy.

276
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.593
Now certain places are going
to be pricier. but consider-

277
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.730
You what?

278
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.930
Room and board with who?

279
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.000
Au pairing?

280
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.610
Oh my God. Claire.

281
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.390
No! I'd rather sell my
body. except not really

282
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.360
because that's super
unhygienic and you know me.

283
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.930
I'm like a super huge germophobe.

284
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.896
But. seriously. why do this?

285
00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:10.921
Well. it's at least a little
cheaper than living with you.

286
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.790
Oh. Claire.

287
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.790
No. I didn't mean. I didn't
mean you could live with me.

288
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.720
I need my space.

289
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.870
You could live near me.

290
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.950
Oh my God. Claire. you love him.

291
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.783
No. I don't.

292
00:19:29.783 --> 00:19:31.047
Sure you do.

293
00:19:31.047 --> 00:19:32.200
Look at you.

294
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.810
Your cheeks are flushed.
your pupils are dilated.

295
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.610
your face looks like this.

296
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.490
and your heartbeat is
Julio Iglesias music.

297
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.140
Get your ear off my boob.

298
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.800
Oh my God. Claire. you
guys should get married.

299
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.900
I should get married to someone

300
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.510
because I met them on the street?

301
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.560
You'd be surprised. People
get married over less.

302
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.810
My cousin Jenna married this guy

303
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.420
because his flesh tones
complemented her home furnishings.

304
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.450
How'd that work out for her?

305
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.280
Oh. she dumped him when his tan faded.

306
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.130
So let that be a lesson to
you before you marry rashly.

307
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.863
Before. do you even listen to you?

308
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.600
What? Sorry. I was so distracted.

309
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.633
You know. your pores are huge.

310
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.110
It's funny what moves some people.

311
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.073
and not others.

312
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.693
For some it's rock-and-roll.

313
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.943
for others it's Beethoven and Brahms.

314
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.953
For one person. it's a Magritte painting.

315
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.180
and for another. it's a guy on ice

316
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.650
hurling himself into the air.

317
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.823
spinning three times. and
landing on one tiny blade.

318
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.320
Somehow. it just makes you
feel a little less lonely

319
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.193
in the world.

320
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.210
And who knows why.

321
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.010
Claire. welcome.

322
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.870
I'm Nadege St. Pierre.
this is my husband Bernard.

323
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.530
He is pleased to meet you.

324
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.940
These are our children.
Elodie and Angelique;

325
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.930
this is my mother. Katia;
and our gouvernante.

326
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.670
how do you say that in English?

327
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.763
Housekeeper.

328
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.883
Bonjour.

329
00:21:27.883 --> 00:21:29.760
Oh. no need. she does not speak French.

330
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.150
She's from Tasmania.

331
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.180
Tanzania.

332
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.036
Yes. that.

333
00:21:34.036 --> 00:21:36.246
Nice to meet you all.

334
00:21:36.246 --> 00:21:39.558
My goodness. you speak such lovely French!

335
00:21:39.558 --> 00:21:41.941
Bernard. she speaks such lovely French!

336
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.345
Mother. she speaks such lovely French!

337
00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:50.222
Such refinement. such education!

338
00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:51.213
So wonderful!

339
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.610
Well. um. this is the key of your room.

340
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.078
Come with me. I'll show you.

341
00:22:00.078 --> 00:22:01.682
Thank you.

342
00:22:01.682 --> 00:22:04.313
You speak so well French.

343
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.260
Oh my God. Claire.

344
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.350
I'm like really depressed
for you. except not really

345
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.350
because I have a really
nice apartment to myself.

346
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.820
but still.

347
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.743
Thanks.

348
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.190
You're welcome. Claire.

349
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.870
So why do they call it a
chambre de bonne anyway.

350
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.700
is it because everybody
that ever lived here

351
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.290
died of depression and all
that was left was their bones?

352
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.613
No. chambre de bonne means maid's room.

353
00:22:36.732 --> 00:22:37.565
Ew.

354
00:22:39.844 --> 00:22:40.677
Gross.

355
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.461
Hello.

356
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:54.203
Hi. my name is Claire Burkhardt.

357
00:22:54.203 --> 00:22:57.192
I'm here to do a documentary project.

358
00:22:57.192 --> 00:22:58.025
Why?

359
00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:04.158
Uh... it was all arranged before I left.

360
00:23:04.158 --> 00:23:05.316
with Mr. Le Drouin.

361
00:23:06.762 --> 00:23:08.303
With whom?

362
00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:09.138
With Mr. ...

363
00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:09.983
Who??

364
00:23:09.983 --> 00:23:10.816
Mr. Le Drouin.

365
00:23:12.082 --> 00:23:14.202
Ah. Mr. Le Drouin!

366
00:23:14.202 --> 00:23:15.694
Of course.

367
00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.235
Because I'll be honest with you.

368
00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:19.176
I can't understand you with your accent.

369
00:23:20.317 --> 00:23:21.908
At any rate. I can't help you.

370
00:23:23.477 --> 00:23:26.458
You better try the
Registrar's office instead.

371
00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:27.316
But... why...

372
00:23:27.316 --> 00:23:28.466
Have a nice day.

373
00:23:38.758 --> 00:23:39.591
Mr. Le Drouin.

374
00:23:45.161 --> 00:23:46.807
Who?

375
00:23:46.807 --> 00:23:48.057
Mister... Le... Drouin.

376
00:23:49.796 --> 00:23:50.996
Ah. Mr. Le Drouin!

377
00:23:53.946 --> 00:23:56.821
Frankly. I can hardly
understand that accent of yours.

378
00:23:59.239 --> 00:24:02.042
Go to the admissions office instead.

379
00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:03.208
It's over there.

380
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.032
Ah. you're here to see Mr. Le Drouin!

381
00:24:22.032 --> 00:24:24.437
Why didn't you say so before?

382
00:24:24.437 --> 00:24:25.581
Though I must say.

383
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:28.692
It's not easy to understand
you. with your...

384
00:24:28.692 --> 00:24:31.122
Yes. I know. My big fat accent.

385
00:24:31.122 --> 00:24:32.238
Yes. exactly.

386
00:24:35.156 --> 00:24:36.639
Go try the front desk.

387
00:24:41.572 --> 00:24:43.117
What did I just tell you?

388
00:24:43.117 --> 00:24:45.057
I know. Madame. but they told me...

389
00:24:45.057 --> 00:24:46.499
What you're doing is very rude.

390
00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:48.939
In France. we do not interrupt.

391
00:24:48.939 --> 00:24:51.272
No. no. it's okay. it's okay.

392
00:24:52.822 --> 00:24:54.205
I'll take it from here.

393
00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:00.040
Hi. I'm. uh. I'm Rafal
Dabrowski. I. I'm a student here.

394
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.053
Uh. they sent me to get you.

395
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.143
Bonjour.

396
00:25:04.143 --> 00:25:06.010
Wow.

397
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.380
Your French is so beautiful.

398
00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.250
So I heard you're gonna be filming us?

399
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.053
Uh. yeah.

400
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.673
And you'll be here all semester. I hope?

401
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.573
Um.

402
00:25:19.407 --> 00:25:20.240
mm. mm-hmm.

403
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.953
So. um.

404
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.324
another question. um.

405
00:25:27.324 --> 00:25:29.574
do you have. um. boyfriend?

406
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:54.563
Hi. um...

407
00:25:56.298 --> 00:25:58.006
...don't we... know each other?

408
00:25:59.199 --> 00:26:00.032
No. madame.

409
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.443
Um. do you know

410
00:26:02.443 --> 00:26:04.659
why Thibaut Baudet isn't on the program?

411
00:26:05.784 --> 00:26:07.386
Yes. madame.

412
00:26:07.386 --> 00:26:09.894
It's because he retired at
the start of the season.

413
00:26:11.634 --> 00:26:13.100
So... he's not skating?

414
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.499
Yes. exactly.

415
00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:16.682
He's not skating.

416
00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:20.022
However...

417
00:26:20.022 --> 00:26:22.180
...he's here to watch the competition.

418
00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:44.188
Well. thanks so much for
coming. It was great to see you.

419
00:26:44.188 --> 00:26:45.996
I hope you guys liked the performance.

420
00:26:45.996 --> 00:26:47.816
He skated really well today.

421
00:26:47.816 --> 00:26:48.916
Especially today.

422
00:26:51.196 --> 00:26:52.029
Hello...

423
00:26:53.062 --> 00:26:54.170

424
00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:57.473
Yes. Uh... Sorry. uh...

00:26:57.473 --> 00:26:58.414

I need to go to the bathroom.

432
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.363
Oh my God.

433
00:27:30.477 --> 00:27:32.338
...favorite skater!

434
00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:34.229
My favorite skater. Is you.

435
00:27:35.247 --> 00:27:36.080
That's all.

436
00:27:37.815 --> 00:27:38.668
...Me?!

437
00:27:38.668 --> 00:27:39.501
Yes!

438
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.641
Well... thanks! That's nice of you.

439
00:27:42.641 --> 00:27:44.433
Wait... we know each other!

440
00:27:44.433 --> 00:27:46.576
We met in New York.

441
00:27:46.576 --> 00:27:48.559
that time I was waiting for a cab.

442
00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:51.000
We talked about puppets. and Guignol.

443
00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:54.556
It's funny. you know...

444
00:27:54.556 --> 00:27:56.569
I've always wanted to do some kind of show

445
00:27:56.569 --> 00:27:58.251
with both skating and puppetry.

446
00:27:58.251 --> 00:27:59.418
Oh? Uh. me too!

447
00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:01.267
No kidding.

448
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.719
Wait. so you live in Paris now?

449
00:28:04.719 --> 00:28:06.852
I could give you my
contact info. if you want.

450
00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:07.685
YES!

451
00:29:42.838 --> 00:29:44.005
Was it good?

452
00:29:45.387 --> 00:29:46.470
Oh. Uh-huh.

453
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.540
It was fine.

454
00:30:43.395 --> 00:30:46.012
So. you work near here. right?

455
00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:48.720
Yup. just around the corner.
for the Banc Francilienne

456
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.303
You work at a bank?

457
00:30:52.612 --> 00:30:53.770
Isn't that boring?

458
00:30:56.237 --> 00:30:57.820
Yes. Life-threateningly.

459
00:30:59.009 --> 00:31:01.875
But I mean... you can't skate
your whole life. you know?

460
00:31:03.478 --> 00:31:04.944
And besides...

461
00:31:04.944 --> 00:31:07.219
...it was a sensible time for me to quit.

462
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:11.824
I'm not getting any younger. after all.

463
00:31:15.377 --> 00:31:16.310
Well. so. uh...

464
00:31:17.399 --> 00:31:20.382
What should we do. for a
skating show with puppets?

465
00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:22.745
Honestly. I don't know.

466
00:31:22.745 --> 00:31:24.390
I really like the concept.

467
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.529
but I'm not really sure
what it would look like.

468
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:28.820
Maybe like a ballet.

469
00:31:30.494 --> 00:31:31.327
A ballet?

470
00:31:32.384 --> 00:31:33.650
You know what. in that case.

471
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.340
we should work with my girlfriend. Trina.

472
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.089
She's an incredible ballet dancer.

473
00:31:41.289 --> 00:31:42.314
Sorry... who?

474
00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:46.308
My girlfriend. Trina. A dancer.

475
00:31:46.308 --> 00:31:48.774
She's American. too. You guys should meet!

476
00:31:52.934 --> 00:31:53.767
You okay?

477
00:31:57.708 --> 00:31:58.541
Yes.

478
00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:00.950
Excuse me.

479
00:32:49.139 --> 00:32:51.330
- Attack! - Killed you! - Got you!

480
00:33:10.324 --> 00:33:11.557
Girls - stop it!

481
00:33:11.557 --> 00:33:12.390
Stop it.

482
00:33:13.719 --> 00:33:15.651
What happened!?

483
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:18.001
Is it your lip? What happened? Show me...

484
00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:19.844
It wasn't me. it wasn't my fault!

485
00:33:19.844 --> 00:33:21.219
Show me. is it your lip?

486
00:33:21.219 --> 00:33:23.344
I didn't do anything. it
wasn't my fault! It wasn't me!

487
00:33:23.344 --> 00:33:25.243
Show me. show me...

488
00:33:25.243 --> 00:33:27.076
It wasn't my fault...

489
00:33:27.076 --> 00:33:29.581
What's going on? Angie?
What happened to her?

490
00:33:29.581 --> 00:33:32.685
- It wasn't me. I didn't do anything!
- What's wrong. Angelique? Show me.

491
00:33:32.685 --> 00:33:34.527
- It wasn't my fault!
- Show me. show me your lip.

492
00:33:34.527 --> 00:33:35.360
It's okay...

493
00:33:36.988 --> 00:33:38.529
It wasn't me. it wasn't my fault...

494
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.720
Claire. don't stress. this
is not your fault. okay?

495
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.833
These things happen.

496
00:33:48.113 --> 00:33:49.900
Can I do anything?

497
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.540
No. really. don't worry yourself.

498
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.923
Just go home and get some rest. okay?

499
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.340
Go on. Have a good night.

500
00:34:13.763 --> 00:34:16.089
It wasn't my fault. wasn't me.

501
00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:17.572
Claire's the one who did it.

502
00:34:19.575 --> 00:34:21.241
Is that true. my little Angie?

503
00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:25.288
What did that mean old Claire do to you?

504
00:34:26.534 --> 00:34:27.734
Did Claire do this?

505
00:34:34.421 --> 00:34:36.029
I have a candy for you!

506
00:34:36.998 --> 00:34:37.935
But! --

507
00:34:37.935 --> 00:34:39.335
...did Claire hit you?

508
00:34:41.466 --> 00:34:42.299
Yeeeees!

509
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.373
Yes!

510
00:34:48.165 --> 00:34:49.165
Dirty Bitch.

511
00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:54.368
Dirty bitch. dirty bitch. dirty bitch!

512
00:34:54.368 --> 00:34:56.584
Dirty bitch. dirty bitch. dirty bitch!

513
00:34:57.845 --> 00:34:58.678
Girls!

514
00:35:00.946 --> 00:35:02.712
Girls. watch your language!

515
00:35:05.125 --> 00:35:05.958
Girls...

516
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:50.373
Are you feeling all right. Claire?

517
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.550
Uh.

518
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.723
yes.

519
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.853
Are you happy here with us?

520
00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:06.254
Sure.

521
00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:30.739
She's not happy here.

522
00:36:30.739 --> 00:36:33.139
Yes. but that's not enough.
We'll need something more.

523
00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:34.530
Bernard. call Khadija.

524
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:35.363
Khadija!

525
00:36:37.255 --> 00:36:39.221
Maybe she'll give us
something interesting.

526
00:36:42.624 --> 00:36:47.080
Khadija. we want to speak
to you about Claire.

527
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.410
about Claire.

528
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.603
Do you understand?

529
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.230
Often you see Claire
with the children. right?

530
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.883
Is she good with them.
or is she bad with them?

531
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.090
Good. she is good.

532
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.560
Bad. You mean bad. right?

533
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.820
No. she is good.

534
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.530
She's good always. Madam.

535
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.393
She is. uh.

536
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.823
beautiful with them.

537
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.440
Maybe she does not understand.

538
00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.550
Bernard. you explain to her.

539
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.660
Nevermind. I'll do it.

540
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.310
Is she ever. mm. lazy?

541
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.340
Like maybe she ignore
the children sometimes?

542
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.660
No.

543
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.020
No. Madam.

544
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.270
she do. uh. the games with the children.

545
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.800
She is much nice.

546
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.903
She. uh. much im.

547
00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:46.613
uh. imagination.

548
00:37:46.613 --> 00:37:49.044
Imagination... Too much
imagination. maybe?

549
00:37:49.044 --> 00:37:50.625
She imagines too much?

550
00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:52.446
She imagines too much.

551
00:37:52.446 --> 00:37:54.146
Works for me.

552
00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:58.400
Uh. so you say that she's
maybe a little stupid.

553
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.453
like a. a little slow.
head always in the clouds.

554
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.393
Yes?

555
00:38:06.942 --> 00:38:08.410
Yes?

556
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.533
Yes?

557
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.610
Yes?

558
00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.403
- Yes?
- Yes?

559
00:38:14.403 --> 00:38:16.360
- Yes?
- Yes?

560
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.600
Uh.

561
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.433
yes.

562
00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:23.541
Excellent. thank you Khadija.

563
00:38:29.942 --> 00:38:32.043
You know. Mom. she's a nice girl.

564
00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.319
but a little too stupid to handle things.

565
00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:36.149
It's a shame!

566
00:38:36.149 --> 00:38:37.104
Yes. yes.

567
00:38:37.104 --> 00:38:37.937
A shame.

568
00:38:39.138 --> 00:38:40.288
She'll have to go.

569
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.681
Yes. we'll have to find a way to get rid--

570
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.490
Claire. Good evening.

571
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:52.120
Oh. we have decided my
mother will supervise you now

572
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.860
while you do the babysitting.

573
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.140
So it's not too hard for you.

574
00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.673
Well. have a good night!

575
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.963
Are you depressed. Claire?

576
00:39:14.761 --> 00:39:18.020
Angelique.

577
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.364
My love.

578
00:39:19.364 --> 00:39:20.197
My baby!

579
00:39:22.184 --> 00:39:23.359
You are my star!

580
00:39:24.664 --> 00:39:25.890
You too!

581
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:29.633
Come give Claire a great big kiss.

582
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.831
Hmm.

583
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:33.664
Hm.

584
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.133
Oh my.

585
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:43.213
Angelique. this is not very polite.

586
00:39:44.509 --> 00:39:46.900
You see. she's just a little baby.

587
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.941
she doesn't know what she does.

588
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.597
You're Grandmaman's little...

589
00:39:58.591 --> 00:40:00.827
Do you want some tea. Grandmaman?

590
00:40:00.827 --> 00:40:02.427
Yes. thank you so much!

591
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.263
A sip for?

592
00:40:05.263 --> 00:40:06.490
Maman.

593
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.489
Very good!

594
00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:11.218
And a sip for?

595
00:40:11.218 --> 00:40:12.850
Papa.
Yes.

596
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.010
a sip for Papa.

597
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.040
How about a sip for

598
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.421
Claire?

599
00:40:20.421 --> 00:40:21.921
No. she's a dirty bitch!

600
00:40:23.271 --> 00:40:25.320
Oh my.

601
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.723
you don't like Claire?

602
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.310
No?

603
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:30.627
Well.

604
00:40:30.627 --> 00:40:35.230
all right then. we
won't do sip for Claire.

605
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.790
No tea for that nasty Claire.

606
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.349
Nasty Claire.

607
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:43.650
And. uh. how about

608
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.749
a sip of tea for?
- Grandmaman.

609
00:41:23.457 --> 00:41:26.250
Okay. let's go over the house rules.

610
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.410
As you know. I'm a huge germophobe.

611
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.420
and you've been sleeping
in a chambre de bonne.

612
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.870
and chambres de bonne probably have nits.

613
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.290
So I do ask that you stay a
minimum of 10 feet away from me.

614
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.160
or 3.05 meters in local measurements.

615
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.540
Wait. so nits can't
travel more than 10 feet?

616
00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.180
Claire. do not put the
fear of God into me.

617
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.763
Well. can I get a pillow at least?

618
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:52.533
Okay.

619
00:41:54.539 --> 00:41:57.389
But I will be asking you to
sleep in protective headgear.

620
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.470
Night. Claire.

621
00:42:08.205 --> 00:42:09.205
Goodnight.

622
00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:49.600
PETRUSHKA - Adaptation
for Skater and Puppeteer.

623
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.200
St. Petersburg. Russia. The 1830s.

624
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.033
A carnival.

625
00:43:55.270 --> 00:44:00.270
Three puppets: a ballerina. a
Moor. and Petrushka. a clown.

626
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.087
A magician called the Charlatan

627
00:44:05.087 --> 00:44:07.370
brings them to life.

628
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.270
Petrushka falls in love
with the ballerina.

629
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.013
but she loves the Moor.

630
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.310
Petrushka is angry and hurt.

631
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.993
and he challenges the Moor to a duel.

632
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:24.840
But the Moor kills him.

633
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.510
So Petrushka's ghost floats
up and he curses the Charlatan

634
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.590
for bringing him to life.

635
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:33.280
before he dies.

636
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.870
again.

637
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.630
So you'll perform it with me?

638
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.720
You'll be Petrushka on skates.

639
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.430
I'll be all the other
characters as puppets.

640
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.030
It'll be perfect.

641
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.030
So you're in?

642
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.215
Um.

643
00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:46.858
Well. Claire. uh...

644
00:44:46.858 --> 00:44:48.223
It's a great story

645
00:44:48.223 --> 00:44:51.039
and I'm sure you'll find
a skater for your project.

646
00:44:51.039 --> 00:44:53.719
But I don't see why it needs to be me.

647
00:44:53.719 --> 00:44:54.951
What!?

648
00:44:54.951 --> 00:44:57.566
There are so many other skaters in Paris.

649
00:44:57.566 --> 00:44:59.694
More talented ones. for that matter.

650
00:44:59.694 --> 00:45:01.600
- Y-you don't get it.

651
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.110
- No. no. no. Claire. you don't get it.

652
00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.070
but that's only because you don't know

653
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.210
anything about skating.

654
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.840
Just take my word for it. okay?

655
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.300
I'm. I'm past my prime.

656
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.060
I had my 15 minutes and now no one wants

657
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.700
or needs to see me on the ice anymore.

658
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.430
I. I'm old news.

659
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.060
Okay. but you wouldn't understand-

660
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.373
Will you shut up!

661
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.293
Enjoy.

662
00:45:35.652 --> 00:45:37.150
Thank you.

663
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.330
- Claire. what I'm trying-
- Nah-uh-uh.

664
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.643
Say one more word and I will
throw this scone in your face.

665
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:52.953
Look.

666
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:58.173
You can't see yourself.

667
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.203
but I can.

668
00:46:03.128 --> 00:46:06.923
And I can see there is no
one else out there like you.

669
00:46:08.724 --> 00:46:11.650
Maybe you don't know how
much talent you have.

670
00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:12.900
but I think that you do

671
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.823
and you try to deny it.

672
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.700
You try to forget what it
was like to be on the ice

673
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.300
because it's too painful to remember.

674
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.120
Instead. you've chosen a
more manageable kind of pain.

675
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.800
the kind of pain you feel every day

676
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.360
at la Banque Francilienne.

677
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.513
That kind of pain you can handle.

678
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.560
It's the white noise in
between the coffee machine

679
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.830
and the snack machine and the restroom-

680
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.593
- But-
- Ah. I am speaking.

681
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.010
It's hard to explain. but

682
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.670
when you were on the ice.

683
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:56.133
you were like this human sunbeam.

684
00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.563
or like a big beating heart on skates.

685
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:05.403
And now you're trying to
erase it because you're hurt.

686
00:47:08.337 --> 00:47:11.160
Really. who can blame you?

687
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.160
Well. you.

688
00:47:14.475 --> 00:47:15.308
Yes.

689
00:47:16.838 --> 00:47:17.671
me.

690
00:47:20.665 --> 00:47:21.665
I blame you.

691
00:47:24.187 --> 00:47:26.860
Because some of us need to see a sunbeam

692
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.143
every once in a while.

693
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.373
Some of us need to feel a beating heart.

694
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:39.633
Some of us need you.

695
00:47:42.753 --> 00:47:47.086
Uh. can I talk?

696
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:54.035
You know. I'm lucky to have a job.

697
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.190
I mean. in this economy.
it's a privilege to be...

698
00:48:06.762 --> 00:48:08.679
You know. you're right.

699
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.553
All I do at work is go to the restroom.

700
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.053
I pee like 20 times a day.

701
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.441
I pee all day long.

702
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.496
I think it's just to give
me an activity to do.

703
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.435
I don't have anything anymore.

704
00:48:33.719 --> 00:48:36.386
So you'll be Petrushka for me?

705
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.480
Okay. let's take
- Okay.

706
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.251
- a look at the next scene.

707
00:49:09.251 --> 00:49:13.380
So Petrushka tries to win
the heart of the ballerina.

708
00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:17.003
but she isn't interested in him.

709
00:49:17.877 --> 00:49:19.154
What?!

710
00:49:19.154 --> 00:49:20.895
She's not interested in me?!

711
00:49:21.867 --> 00:49:24.076
Well. we'll just see about that.

712
00:49:24.076 --> 00:49:25.092
Give me that.

713
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.553
Look

714
00:49:29.815 --> 00:49:31.930
deep into my Russian eyes.

715
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.210
Oh my God.

716
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.068
You will love me.

717
00:49:35.068 --> 00:49:37.710
Say that you vant me.

718
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.665
I love you. Kiss me. you fool.

719
00:49:44.091 --> 00:49:46.369
You see? Child's play.

720
00:49:46.369 --> 00:49:47.694
Bravo. Give me that.

721
00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:50.723
- Okay. okay.
- Let's take it from the top.

722
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.440
You are trying to impress her.
but she runs away from you.

723
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.960
And then you curse the
portrait of the Charlatan

724
00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.722
who brought you to life.

725
00:49:58.722 --> 00:49:59.654
Okay. okay.

726
00:49:59.654 --> 00:50:01.324
I'm going to improvise a bit.

727
00:50:01.324 --> 00:50:03.056
Can you put on the music?

728
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.930
You had your 15 minutes.

729
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:06.440
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

730
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.867
You are old news.

731
00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:34.982
What are you doing!?

732
00:51:34.982 --> 00:51:36.298
I don't know. Claire...

733
00:51:37.737 --> 00:51:39.770
I... thought I was done with all this.

734
00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:42.642
I mean. I have a life. a job...

735
00:51:43.762 --> 00:51:46.419
I don't want to do stuff like this.

736
00:51:46.419 --> 00:51:47.435
What is this?

737
00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:50.540
It's my sock.

738
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.090
It is more than that.

739
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.150
It is a hostage.

740
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.610
I'm taking your pretty little sock home.

741
00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:57.130
and I'm going to keep it until
you get back out on the ice

742
00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:58.543
and start performing again.

743
00:52:01.012 --> 00:52:03.549
You know. I don't give a
shit about an old sock.

744
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:05.020
And about performing?

745
00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.803
I suppose you don't give
a shit about that either?

746
00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:12.559
You know. you're going to
have that sock forever.

747
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:15.143
You promised me.

748
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.163
I trusted you. don't let me down.

749
00:52:21.727 --> 00:52:25.695
Prove yourself worthy of your sock.

750
00:52:25.695 --> 00:52:26.528
Thibaut.

751
00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.010
You look happy.

752
00:55:06.533 --> 00:55:11.113
So you're. uh. interested in the festival?

753
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.713
Uh. yeah.

754
00:55:14.663 --> 00:55:16.357
Um. maybe. um.

755
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:19.203
You. too?

756
00:55:19.203 --> 00:55:21.070
No.

757
00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:24.897
not at all.

758
00:55:26.461 --> 00:55:29.230
You're really charming. you know?

759
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:32.480
Charming. and a little shy.

760
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.430
Shy?

761
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.310
Yes. there's something about you.

762
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.863
like you're not very self-assured.

763
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.663
It's really lovely. uh. poetic even.

764
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.177
Do you. uh. know the
French word. mm. farouche?

765
00:55:47.314 --> 00:55:48.903
Uh. no.

766
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.423
It means shy. but it also means wild.

767
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:59.660
And if I'm not mistaken.
you're a little bit of both.

768
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.420
I don't know.

769
00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.717
Oh. sure you do.

770
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.000
Deep down you're a tigress.

771
00:56:13.089 --> 00:56:14.422
We both know it.

772
00:56:15.943 --> 00:56:18.723
Does it bother you that
I can read your mind?

773
00:56:21.572 --> 00:56:24.583
Um.

774
00:56:24.583 --> 00:56:25.491
Hey. Rafal!

775
00:56:25.491 --> 00:56:27.706
You gonna come rehearse with us or not?!

776
00:56:27.706 --> 00:56:29.339
Uh. hang on. be right there!

777
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.673
See you.

778
00:56:35.547 --> 00:56:36.380
Tigress.

779
00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:47.070
You know what your fatal
flaw is. don't you?

780
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.060
No. please. tell me.

781
00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.570
I'm getting to that. Claire.

782
00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:52.300
Please be patient.

783
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.780
Your problem is. you're not sexual enough.

784
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.500
A guy just called me a tigress.

785
00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.620
and now you're telling me
it's because I'm not sexual?

786
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.220
Exactly. Claire.

787
00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:04.300
He was using reverse psychology on you

788
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.500
to turn you into a sexual being.

789
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.520
Only it didn't work.

790
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.170
However. my PowerPoint on the
subject should do the trick.

791
00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:11.370
You prepared a PowerPoint?

792
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:12.843
Shh it's loading.

793
00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:20.470
Now. there are two types
of people in this world.

794
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.663
the non-sexual.

795
00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:23.740
that's you.

796
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.773
and the sexual.

797
00:57:25.916 --> 00:57:28.540
ta-da.

798
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:33.240
So now we ask. how do
we turn this into this?

799
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.410
It's simple. you wanna be a tigress?

800
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:38.250
You have to think like a tigress.

801
00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.740
The first step is to develop a
nice sexually arousing growl.

802
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:43.148
Now growl for me.

803
00:57:43.148 --> 00:57:44.108
No.

804
00:57:44.108 --> 00:57:45.434
Do it or I'll scream.

805
00:57:46.855 --> 00:57:48.501
More oomph!

806
00:57:50.507 --> 00:57:52.357
I need more. Claire.

807
00:57:53.475 --> 00:57:54.715
More!

808
00:57:56.192 --> 00:57:58.893
I'm not sexually excited.
guess I'll read a magazine.

809
00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:03.358
Hey. this is in French.

810
00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:07.512
Nope. frigid!

811
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.464
Dry as the Sahara.

812
00:58:16.072 --> 00:58:17.513
Ooh.

813
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.433
Oop. nope. I was ovulating.

814
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.957
Hey. that one was good!

815
00:58:35.857 --> 00:58:37.539
Our rehearsals are so nice.

816
00:58:37.539 --> 00:58:39.438
Yeah. A little too nice. maybe.

817
00:58:41.142 --> 00:58:42.517
What do you mean?!

818
00:58:44.873 --> 00:58:46.263
Oh. um. just that. uh...

819
00:58:46.263 --> 00:58:49.028
It's cool just having
something nice to do.

820
00:58:49.028 --> 00:58:50.394
I could get used to it.

821
00:58:52.721 --> 00:58:53.996
Oh. check this out...

822
00:58:56.043 --> 00:58:58.259
I'm going to submit us for the festival.

823
00:59:00.282 --> 00:59:01.115
You and me.

824
00:59:04.322 --> 00:59:05.155
You and me...

825
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.090
And do not forget. you
have to do this with me

826
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:17.200
because I still have your sock.

827
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.443
Yes. I know. I know.

828
00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.693
See ya.

829
00:59:36.136 --> 00:59:37.207
Hey dude.

830
00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:38.878
that wasn't your Asian chick.

831
00:59:38.878 --> 00:59:40.432
No. no... that was a colleague.

832
00:59:40.432 --> 00:59:41.565
We were rehearsing.

833
00:59:41.565 --> 00:59:43.536
Ah. yes. "rehearsing."

834
00:59:43.536 --> 00:59:46.194
So. how many times have you
banged your "colleague"?

835
00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.046
Shut up. Maxime.

836
00:59:48.046 --> 00:59:48.945
What. you don't want to?

837
00:59:48.945 --> 00:59:50.544
No. of course I don't want
to! Why would I want to?

838
00:59:50.544 --> 00:59:51.610
See. you do want to!

839
00:59:52.925 --> 00:59:53.758
Want to what?

840
00:59:54.744 --> 00:59:58.161
To bang his other girlfriend. of course.

841
00:59:59.141 --> 01:00:00.436
All right. Gotta go.

842
01:00:00.436 --> 01:00:01.269
So long!

843
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.204
What's Maxime talking about?

844
01:00:05.204 --> 01:00:06.454
God knows.

845
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.267
He's insane.

846
01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:29.023
Hello. my name is Claire Burkhardt.

847
01:00:29.023 --> 01:00:30.739
I'm American. I live in Paris.

848
01:00:32.599 --> 01:00:34.750
and I wanted to drop off these...

849
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:36.283
No. Not possible.

850
01:00:37.417 --> 01:00:38.790
Can I at least tell you

851
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:40.398
what my question is first?

852
01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:44.198
Fine. if you must.

853
01:00:45.035 --> 01:00:47.660
I wanted to leave these flyers.

854
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.552
For my puppetry services.

855
01:00:51.498 --> 01:00:53.018
You want parents to hire you

856
01:00:53.018 --> 01:00:54.734
for birthday parties - is that right?

857
01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.175
Yes. exactly.

858
01:00:56.175 --> 01:00:58.746
Well. I'm not going to tell you no.

859
01:00:58.746 --> 01:00:59.754
But. frankly.

860
01:01:00.665 --> 01:01:02.936
you'll have a hard time
getting hired in Paris.

861
01:01:02.936 --> 01:01:05.029
because the thing is. Parisian parents --

862
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.804
- - they have standards. you see.

863
01:01:07.804 --> 01:01:09.612
But I'm not going to tell you no.

864
01:01:11.055 --> 01:01:11.930
That said --

865
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.390
I'm going to put your flyers
at the very back of the store.

866
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.190
behind everything. where
no one will see them.

867
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.023
Okay?

868
01:01:20.059 --> 01:01:20.939
Thanks.

869
01:01:20.939 --> 01:01:22.755
Anytime. my dear.

870
01:01:22.755 --> 01:01:24.538
And good luck. eh?

871
01:01:24.538 --> 01:01:25.414
Because --

872
01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:27.405
It's not easy to get hired in Paris.

873
01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:35.770
Did you always wanna be a puppeteer?

874
01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:36.963
No. not necessarily.

875
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.490
Sometimes I wanted to be a
writer. sometimes a musician.

876
01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:45.120
I just wanted to create my
own universe however I could.

877
01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.200
The universe of Rafal

878
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.200
or the Raphaelite universe.

879
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:57.040
Get it?

880
01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.850
Raphaelite has a double meaning there.

881
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.613
because Raphael. or Rafal...

882
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.790
You see. there was once a great painter

883
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:07.670
by the name of Raphael.

884
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:09.230
It was different for me.

885
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:13.124
I always wanted to-
The Raphaelite universe.

886
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.460
I just always wanted to tell
stories however I could.

887
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.093
one way or another.

888
01:02:21.626 --> 01:02:22.840
Do you like stories?

889
01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.610
Oh. yeah.

890
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.880
Um. I have a friend
who is a figure skater.

891
01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.210
and he can tell the most
beautiful stories on ice

892
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.680
without saying a single-

893
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.437
You know who's beautiful?

894
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:40.943
In fact. his name is Thibaut
Baudet. the figure skater.

895
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.570
Maybe you've heard of him?

896
01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:45.923
Mm. don't think so.

897
01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:49.143
He's amazing.

898
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:51.290
You know who's amazing?

899
01:02:56.952 --> 01:02:57.943
Wait. why?

900
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.875
You're beautiful.

901
01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:01.780
You're just so beautiful.

902
01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.246
I. I can't stop thinking about you.

903
01:03:04.246 --> 01:03:05.079
Really?

904
01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:06.379
Since the day I met you.

905
01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:15.635
Y-you're allowed to kiss back. you know?

906
01:03:25.363 --> 01:03:27.102
You're even allowed to open your mouth.

907
01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.820
You learn fast. little tigress.

908
01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:21.963
What?

909
01:04:24.374 --> 01:04:25.740
It.

910
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.033
it's a little complicated.

911
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:30.893
Complicated.

912
01:04:32.005 --> 01:04:35.803
what do you mean. uh. complicated?

913
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.933
You've never done it?

914
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.773
Wow.

915
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.113
Why?

916
01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.210
Because no one wanted
to have sex with a girl

917
01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:58.113
who has 45 puppets on her bed.

918
01:05:02.084 --> 01:05:04.163
Well. um.

919
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:08.793
personally. I'd call that a turn on.

920
01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:21.733
I knew I liked you.

921
01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:34.711
Oh my God. oh my God.
oh. that was amazing.

922
01:05:44.491 --> 01:05:45.741
There's more.

923
01:05:50.248 --> 01:05:51.081
right?

924
01:06:16.578 --> 01:06:18.997
What's wrong beautiful?

925
01:06:18.997 --> 01:06:21.497
Why are you looking like that?

926
01:06:22.688 --> 01:06:23.938
It's nothing.

927
01:06:27.605 --> 01:06:29.022
Nothing at all.

928
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.410
Claire. question.

929
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:40.310
if somebody serves you a
suggestively shaped croissant.

930
01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.630
do you have the right to sue?

931
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:42.873
Because according to my attorney...

932
01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:45.060
Oh dear God.

933
01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.430
What happened to you?

934
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:49.460
Some birthday kid's mom
put a clown wig on me.

935
01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.320
That's what.

936
01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.870
You know I have coulrophobia.
or a fear of clowns.

937
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.610
due to the time a clown
bit me in the wild.

938
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:55.443
Please remove it.

939
01:06:55.443 --> 01:06:56.910
Give me a sec. will you?

940
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:59.130
An army of rabid moms
stuck this to my head

941
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:02.290
with France's national
supply of bobby pins.

942
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:05.713
Also. my day was fantastic.
thank you for asking.

943
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.440
Mademoiselle?

944
01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.475
Yes. you.

945
01:07:09.475 --> 01:07:12.713
Ze puppet person. come here at once!

946
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.230
Oui. madame?

947
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:19.620
You will wear this clown wig
or else. s'il vous plait.

948
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.660
I don't need it. I'm
here to do a puppet show.

949
01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:25.790
Ah. but you do not understand.

950
01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:29.480
the birthday girl is my
tiny snot of a daughter

951
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.423
and she insists that you wear it.

952
01:07:35.437 --> 01:07:39.950
Wear it or die!

953
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.609
Tres bien.

954
01:07:41.609 --> 01:07:42.942
Kids. come here!

955
01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:48.793
The clown lady is here
to do face painting!

956
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.830
What is that on my cheek?

957
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:55.600
A corpse?

958
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.693
No. it's a butterfly.

959
01:07:59.061 --> 01:07:59.894
No.

960
01:08:01.726 --> 01:08:03.345
I wanted

961
01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:08.345
a good butterfly!

962
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:12.590
Oh. la la la la!

963
01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:14.763
We are very disapproving!

964
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.530
As punishment. we will let
our children run around

965
01:08:19.530 --> 01:08:21.913
and scream while you try to perform.

966
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:26.010
and then we will criticize
your performance.

967
01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:29.873
which we did not watch!

968
01:08:32.039 --> 01:08:33.680
And

969
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.613
scene.

970
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.943
Is there more?

971
01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:11.753
No. don't say that.

972
01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:20.910
Give me that.

973
01:09:24.811 --> 01:09:26.923
You know. it's funny.

974
01:09:26.923 --> 01:09:29.073
all my life I've only ever done one thing.

975
01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.973
Every single day. repeat
and repeat and repeat.

976
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.150
And I was pretty damn good at that thing.

977
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.523
And now it turns out I
can't do anything else.

978
01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.250
It's like I was just dropped
in the middle of the ocean

979
01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:48.505
without a lifeboat.

980
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.043
And so when Claire
asked me to skate again.

981
01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:02.130
I felt like I could just swim
back. a million miles back

982
01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:06.680
just to. to skate and. and
feel like myself again.

983
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.170
You know what I mean?

984
01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.837
Yep. Mm-hmm.

985
01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:12.783
Did you hear me?

986
01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.930
Sure. skating. repetitive.
million miles away.

987
01:10:26.034 --> 01:10:27.034
Thank you.

988
01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:35.641
Oh. right. The puppets.

989
01:11:37.882 --> 01:11:38.715
Excuse me.

990
01:11:58.373 --> 01:11:59.206
Here.

991
01:12:00.244 --> 01:12:02.177
And. um. sorry about everything.

992
01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:07.404
No need to be sorry. Monsieur Petrushka.

993
01:12:07.404 --> 01:12:09.870
I submitted us for the
puppetry festival --

994
01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:12.843
- - and they've selected us.

995
01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.136
Here.

996
01:12:27.866 --> 01:12:29.217
Unbelievable.

997
01:12:29.217 --> 01:12:31.129
Why are you forcing me to do this?

998
01:12:31.129 --> 01:12:32.920
Why can't you just let it go?

999
01:12:34.503 --> 01:12:35.686
Excuse me?

1000
01:12:35.686 --> 01:12:39.190
I. I already told you. I'm
not interested anymore.

1001
01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:40.840
But y-you were.

1002
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.470
Yes. I was. and now I'm not anymore.

1003
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:46.080
Is that. is that so hard to understand?

1004
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.250
I mean. w-why do this?

1005
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.634
Why. why. what's the point

1006
01:12:48.634 --> 01:12:50.120
of forcing me?
- I'm not trying to force you.

1007
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.950
I'm trying to help you. that's
what you do for friends.

1008
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:54.475
But we're not friends!

1009
01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.438
We-we're colleagues. we know each other.

1010
01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:13.660
Claire. you...

1011
01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:16.108
...you think we're close.
because you know my performances.

1012
01:13:16.108 --> 01:13:17.792
But the "me"...

1013
01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:20.258
The Thibaut on the ice and
the Thibaut in front of you

1014
01:13:20.258 --> 01:13:21.653
aren't the same person.

1015
01:13:21.653 --> 01:13:22.534
Okay?

1016
01:13:22.534 --> 01:13:25.590
You know. I... I have my own private life.

1017
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.131
And you're not part of it.

1018
01:13:29.074 --> 01:13:32.090
You don't need to take care of me. Claire.

1019
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:34.574
You'd do better to concentrate on you.

1020
01:13:34.574 --> 01:13:36.307
Okay? I don't need your help.

1021
01:13:38.228 --> 01:13:40.728
Go do something that has meaning for you.

1022
01:13:42.704 --> 01:13:44.404
You mean like you with the bank?

1023
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:53.140
Claire. I. I. I don't mean to hurt you.

1024
01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.340
You're not hurting me.

1025
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.903
If the ice you wasn't the real you.

1026
01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:07.240
then you had me fooled.

1027
01:14:13.941 --> 01:14:16.941
If you see him. tell him I miss him.

1028
01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:21.683
Goodbye. Petrushka.

1029
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:37.003
I don't get it. I thought
he and I were getting along.

1030
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.490
You think maybe he's afraid?

1031
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:41.590
Afraid of what?

1032
01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.930
Who knows?

1033
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:46.880
Guys are just fearful creatures.

1034
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.730
And then they try to cover it
up by acting like assholes.

1035
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.830
Could be.

1036
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:57.597
Anyway. lucky for you.
it's not your problem.

1037
01:15:01.306 --> 01:15:02.557
I don't know.

1038
01:15:02.557 --> 01:15:05.053
It's just so hard to let go.

1039
01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:10.130
I got too invested

1040
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.963
in the show.

1041
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:17.113
Fortunately. you have
other things in your life.

1042
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.233
Yeah.

1043
01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:26.616
I guess

1044
01:15:26.616 --> 01:15:28.153
he's just scared.

1045
01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:34.660
You know. it's ironic. the name Thibaut.

1046
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.113
it means brave.

1047
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:38.690
Funny. huh?

1048
01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:40.340
Yeah.

1049
01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.173
Funny.

1050
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.230
So did you like it?

1051
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:55.011
Yeah. it was great.

1052
01:15:55.011 --> 01:15:56.340
Really?

1053
01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.960
Yeah. the music. the acting.

1054
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.063
it was perfect.

1055
01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:04.000
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

1056
01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:06.080
Why?

1057
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.370
Why?

1058
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:10.150
Because it was mediocre.
and that's being generous.

1059
01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:12.120
It was amateurish.

1060
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.463
The problems are obvious
to an educated person.

1061
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.113
Well. anyway. it was nice.

1062
01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:28.200
Nice. interesting
concept you have of nice.

1063
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.680
Maybe one day you'll understand
why that wasn't good cinema.

1064
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.130
Okay.

1065
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.053
What do you mean. okay?

1066
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:38.800
I mean. I don't care. Rafal.

1067
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.750
We can agree to disagree. but
I don't wanna fight about it.

1068
01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.133
Are you sure about that?

1069
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.547
I don't get it. Rafal.

1070
01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:11.310
You just want us to fight

1071
01:17:12.968 --> 01:17:14.093
for nothing?

1072
01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:51.150
I don't know how to tell him
it doesn't feel good anymore.

1073
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.590
None of this makes sense.
All he wants to do is fight.

1074
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:58.640
And at first. I thought it
was because he was upset.

1075
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.680
and then I realized it's turning him on.

1076
01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.280
It's all just to have sex.

1077
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.550
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. Claire.

1078
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:07.823
Back up. back up.

1079
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.200
You had sex?

1080
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.903
- Yeah.
- Without consulting me?

1081
01:18:15.119 --> 01:18:16.090
It just kinda happened.

1082
01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:18.330
But I never got to give
you your sexual education.

1083
01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:20.280
Nevermind. we'll start now.

1084
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.280
Okay. the first rule in
having sex is: don't have sex.

1085
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.860
Little late.

1086
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.870
Listen. Claire. you may not know it.

1087
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:33.129
but you are an innocent baby marshmallow.

1088
01:18:33.129 --> 01:18:34.820
And I don't think you
understand the gravity here.

1089
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.140
Do you realize what happens when a man

1090
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.653
sticks his thing in you?

1091
01:18:41.887 --> 01:18:43.880
The answer is germs. mega germs.

1092
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.880
Now. I'm about to tell
you something so gross.

1093
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.560
so disgusting. you're going
to want to cover your ears.

1094
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.610
I'll cover mine. too.

1095
01:18:58.031 --> 01:18:58.864
Okay.

1096
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:02.490
So you know condoms. right?

1097
01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:04.071
Yes. Julia. I know condoms.

1098
01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:05.050
Could we maybe-
- So the thing about condoms

1099
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:09.070
is when a guy puts one on. it
covers his one thing. right?

1100
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:13.490
But it doesn't cover his other two things.

1101
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:15.900
- Testicles.
- I'm sorry. Claire.

1102
01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.470
I wasn't emotionally prepared for that.

1103
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:22.090
but. yes. it doesn't cover them.

1104
01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:25.780
That would be impossible and painful.

1105
01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.750
So? Men should learn to live with pain.

1106
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:29.400
It toughens the loins.

1107
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.930
Now. it's obviously too late for you.

1108
01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:34.300
who have exposed yourself to
all manners of ball germs.

1109
01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.890
or. in medical terms. testicooties.

1110
01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:40.360
But. for those as yet un-besmirched.

1111
01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.530
I've made a miracle product.

1112
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:46.203
the likes of which shall
revolutionize the sex industry.

1113
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.070
See. it covers the entire
leg so not one of those

1114
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:54.060
icky man-germs will
touch your precious skin.

1115
01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.790
And for those who live on the wild side.

1116
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:57.400
not that I endorse that sort of thing.

1117
01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.053
I've developed the lederhosen variety.

1118
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.133
Good God.

1119
01:20:03.133 --> 01:20:03.966
Say what you will.

1120
01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:06.460
but I plan to make a
killing at Oktoberfest.

1121
01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:10.263
I don't know. I. I think
people want sex to be fun.

1122
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:13.900
Wait. sex is supposed to be fun?

1123
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:33.786
What's wrong?

1124
01:20:33.786 --> 01:20:37.173
I don't know.

1125
01:20:37.173 --> 01:20:39.910
I think I might be a bad person.

1126
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:41.518
What makes you say that?

1127
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:45.143
I think I made a really bad mistake today.

1128
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.980
Saying no to the puppet show. I mean.

1129
01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.083
Oh. really? So you think
I gave you bad advice?

1130
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:56.203
I don't know.

1131
01:20:56.203 --> 01:20:57.790
All I did was tell you the truth.

1132
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:59.220
Your skating days are behind you.

1133
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.040
you know that.
- Yes. I know that. yes.

1134
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.310
Yes. but I don't know. I. I like.

1135
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:05.998
I liked working with Claire.

1136
01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.007
It just gave me something
that was missing from my life.

1137
01:21:10.007 --> 01:21:11.500
you know?

1138
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.650
Wow.

1139
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.873
Well. sorry to hear that.

1140
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.703
Did you ever just sort of
not appreciate somebody.

1141
01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:29.810
like not knowing how much
they cared about you.

1142
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:32.100
or how much you were hurting them.

1143
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.820
even though it was right
there in front of you?

1144
01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.470
Gosh. I don't know. Thibaut.

1145
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:41.080
what with spending my
days overworking my body.

1146
01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.940
making myself crazy for a dance company

1147
01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:47.130
that sees women as disposable.

1148
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.470
Then coming home to a boyfriend

1149
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:52.363
who stares through me
as if I'm a hologram.

1150
01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:58.083
That definitely takes up all
my mental space these days.

1151
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:02.010
But now that I think about it.

1152
01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:05.530
definitely go find your sweetie-pie Claire

1153
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:09.608
and let her know she has
been missing from your life.

1154
01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.233
Did you want any soup?

1155
01:22:32.533 --> 01:22:33.366
Fuck!

1156
01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:46.653
Claire.

1157
01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.023
Claire. wake up.

1158
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:52.780
What? Are you okay?

1159
01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.613
I don't know. Claire.

1160
01:22:53.613 --> 01:22:56.513
I'm just overwhelmed by this
feeling that you don't love me.

1161
01:22:57.595 --> 01:22:59.560
Of course. I love you.

1162
01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.843
I don't think so. You don't seem sure.

1163
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:06.470
I love you a lot. Rafal. but it's 4 am.

1164
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:08.573
let's just go to sleep.

1165
01:23:12.232 --> 01:23:15.730
I can't bear you turning
your back against me.

1166
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:16.740
Switch sides of the bed with me.

1167
01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:18.630
so I can have you facing me.

1168
01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:19.463
What?

1169
01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:25.003
You take my side and I take yours.

1170
01:23:26.671 --> 01:23:27.671
You have to face me.

1171
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:32.823
If you turn your back to me.
it means you don't love me.

1172
01:23:32.823 --> 01:23:35.850
But that's crazy.

1173
01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.493
Switch sides with me. Claire.

1174
01:23:38.335 --> 01:23:41.002
You'd do it if you love me.

1175
01:23:42.594 --> 01:23:43.869
Switch sides!

1176
01:24:01.494 --> 01:24:03.119
Tha-that's better.

1177
01:24:49.998 --> 01:24:51.907
Stop! Girls. stop!

1178
01:24:51.907 --> 01:24:54.030
No. no. no. no. no.

1179
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:56.347
Give me that! No! Stop!

1180
01:25:17.732 --> 01:25:19.871
May I have your attention. please...

1181
01:25:19.871 --> 01:25:21.987
I DON'T LIKE THIS PUPPET SHOW!

1182
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.162
Will you just-

1183
01:25:28.559 --> 01:25:30.891
Give me that! Give me...

1184
01:25:30.891 --> 01:25:34.622
Give. give me that! Give me that!

1185
01:25:34.622 --> 01:25:37.372
Will you just give. give me!

1186
01:25:37.372 --> 01:25:38.205
No!

1187
01:25:42.164 --> 01:25:43.145
Give that!

1188
01:25:47.617 --> 01:25:52.617
I hate you. you little shits!

1189
01:26:44.921 --> 01:26:46.588
Who was that then?

1190
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:21.380
I brought my own stuff to throw. too.

1191
01:27:26.305 --> 01:27:28.803
You're a good friend.

1192
01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:34.527
I'm ready when you are.

1193
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.903
Ready.

1194
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:43.743
No more.

1195
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:49.413
No more!

1196
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.419
No more! I can't believe I just-

1197
01:27:53.419 --> 01:27:54.730
- Hi-ya!
- Okay. Julia. you really

1198
01:27:54.730 --> 01:27:57.567
don't have to-
- Hi-ya!

1199
01:27:58.997 --> 01:28:01.746
Hi-ya!

1200
01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:05.333
Okey dokey.

1201
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.720
So how are you getting to the airport?

1202
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.220
Please. tell me you're not
taking a bus. buses have crud.

1203
01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:27.530
Crud.

1204
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:29.243
Yes. Claire! Crud.

1205
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:33.740
One time. I read about
a girl who went on a bus

1206
01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.640
and she contracted bus
crud. and then she died.

1207
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.510
and then it was made
into a Lifetime movie.

1208
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:43.530
Relax. I scheduled a car for30.

1209
01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:46.520
and I'll be back to get
my luggage on the way.

1210
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.050
Oh my God. Claire.. what about skater boy?

1211
01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:50.520
Did you tell him you're leaving?

1212
01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:54.973
No. he hates me. plus I'll
probably never see him again.

1213
01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.613
Uh.

1214
01:29:02.322 --> 01:29:03.155
Hi.

1215
01:29:04.141 --> 01:29:04.974
Hi.

1216
01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:09.296
Uh... how are you?

1217
01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:11.013
Okay.

1218
01:29:12.087 --> 01:29:12.920
Maybe.

1219
01:29:14.210 --> 01:29:16.424
I'm actually about to leave France.

1220
01:29:16.424 --> 01:29:17.327
Really?

1221
01:29:17.327 --> 01:29:19.051
I'm going back to the US.

1222
01:29:21.683 --> 01:29:22.567
For good?

1223
01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:23.400
Yeah.

1224
01:29:24.628 --> 01:29:25.461
Oh.

1225
01:29:29.683 --> 01:29:31.933
Actually. Claire. I wanted to say...

1226
01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.485
...You were saying?

1227
01:29:44.089 --> 01:29:45.455
...I forgot. But. um...

1228
01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:49.654
I wanted to say have a good trip.

1229
01:29:51.871 --> 01:29:52.704
and...

1230
01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:54.797
... good luck...

1231
01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:57.749
And. um...

1232
01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:02.585
...have. have a good trip. um...

1233
01:30:12.822 --> 01:30:16.050
Actually. do you want to take a walk?

1234
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:17.696
Yeah.

1235
01:30:17.696 --> 01:30:19.616
Yeah. I'd like that.

1236
01:30:19.616 --> 01:30:20.449
Please.

1237
01:30:28.552 --> 01:30:31.848
So what are you up to these days?

1238
01:30:31.848 --> 01:30:33.773
Oh... nothing much. really.

1239
01:30:35.441 --> 01:30:38.238
In a few days I'm taking
Trina to Portugal.

1240
01:30:38.238 --> 01:30:39.548
for the weekend.

1241
01:30:39.548 --> 01:30:41.784
We need some time together.

1242
01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:42.892
It'll do us good.

1243
01:30:43.878 --> 01:30:44.711
... maybe.

1244
01:30:45.997 --> 01:30:47.972
You know. I still have your sock.

1245
01:30:51.623 --> 01:30:54.006
Well. I did say you'd have it forever.

1246
01:30:55.507 --> 01:30:57.434
Claire. actually. I have to say...

1247
01:30:57.434 --> 01:30:58.267
I.

1248
01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.593
I wanted to say.

1249
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.440
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

1250
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:12.663
If I cared less. I would.

1251
01:31:14.714 --> 01:31:17.937
I would probably let
you be closer. you know?

1252
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:22.962
But you'll never be far
from me. you understand?

1253
01:31:28.501 --> 01:31:31.688
Phew. okay. that's enough of that.

1254
01:31:31.688 --> 01:31:32.521
Um.

1255
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.753
I.

1256
01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:41.653
I can't forget what you
say. even if I want to.

1257
01:31:41.653 --> 01:31:45.677
How do you like. um. how do you say. um.

1258
01:31:47.448 --> 01:31:48.865
une fee-marraine?

1259
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:51.810
A fairy godmother?

1260
01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:53.840
Oui! Voila!

1261
01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.673
You're like a very
annoying fairy grandmother.

1262
01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:08.003
Oh my God. that's my airport cab.

1263
01:33:47.865 --> 01:33:49.448
Goodbye. Petrushka.

1264
01:34:49.155 --> 01:34:52.070
... achieving more than two
million euros in turnover.

1265
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:54.612
So if they can finish out
this round of fundraising

1266
01:34:54.612 --> 01:34:55.920
before the end of January.

1267
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.562
I think they'll bring their
capital to fifty million eur...

1268
01:35:01.494 --> 01:35:02.927
... you okay. Thibaut?

1269
01:35:03.785 --> 01:35:05.450
Hm?

1270
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:06.881
Um.

1271
01:35:06.881 --> 01:35:08.364
Yes. Yeah. of course.

1272
01:35:09.369 --> 01:35:11.244
Will you excuse me a minute?

1273
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.863
It's funny what moves some
people and not others.

1274
01:35:41.530 --> 01:35:44.440
For some people. it's a meteor shower.

1275
01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.190
For others. it's a math problem.

1276
01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:53.788
For some. it's the night sky.

1277
01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.300
And for others. it's the memory of a girl

1278
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.457
staring at you in the soul
and saying. "Do better."

1279
01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:09.120
And sometimes. the best you can do

1280
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.263
is to put that memory in a box.

1281
01:36:12.968 --> 01:36:14.718
then leave it there.

1282
01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.447
And put yourself first for a change.

1283
01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.230
Because what if the light
you saw in someone else

1284
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:26.100
was really your own light
reflected back at you?
