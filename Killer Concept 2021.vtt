(gentle piano music)

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.480
- Oh. yeah. I don't think I'm gonna go.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.533
I'll just stay here. watch a movie.

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.995
I know. I know. I never go
out with you guys anymore.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:33.995

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.920
Listen...

10
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.063
I'm dying for some me time.

11
00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:50.963
I just really need to stay in tonight.

12
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.519
(ominous music)

13
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.393
I know.

14
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.850
I know.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.015
Me and my excuses.

16
00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:05.682
(ominous music)

17
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.683
Okay. Have a drink for me.

18
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.623
You guys have fun and be safe.

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.250
All right. bye.

20
00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:17.590

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.282

(suspenseful music)

25
00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:05.732
Hello?

26
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.868
(door creaking)

27
00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:28.356
(startling music)

28
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.800
(pad slaps table)

29
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.883
- Why is she naked?

30
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.090
- Do you shower with clothes on?

31
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.390
- I don't. but Mary Rose
was not found in her home.

32
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.440
and she was not nude when
they discovered her body.

33
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.490
so I'm wondering why she's
getting naked in this scenario.

34
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.880
- Look. horror fans want certain things

35
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.610
in their films. okay?

36
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.443
- Tits?

37
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.160
- Among other things.

38
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.660
- Like. what else?

39
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.790
- Blood. clowns. and incest hillbillies.

40
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.430
which you two shot down immediately!

41
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.300
- I'm still against those.

42
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.083
- I still feel fine about
that decision. by the way.

43
00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:16.250
- Fine.

44
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.510
- Before we proceed any further.

45
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.280
I've mentioned this before. but
I'm just gonna say it again.

46
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.840
Is this exploitative?

47
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.910
- Since when did showing a
beautiful woman's body on camera

48
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.320
become exploitative?

49
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.050
- I'm not talking about the nude scene.

50
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.220
I'm talking about writing a horror movie

51
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.540
about murders that are
taking place. you know.

52
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.850
among our neighbors and community
in the very recent past.

53
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.110
- You're right. You're right.

54
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.730
We'll get a few angry emails.
a couple of bad reviews.

55
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.070
but look. guys. this is gonna be huge!

56
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.340
Think about it. Who's done this before?

57
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.980
A movie about a murderer
that's still at large.

58
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.173
Think about it. You're in the
theater watching this movie.

59
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.883
Who's that? Is that your friend. John?

60
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.690
Or is that the murderer?

61
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.243
- That's interesting.

62
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.510
- I don't wanna step on
anybody's toes or anything.

63
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.140
and I'm not a writer.

64
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.910
but I am a little nervous about
looking into these murders

65
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.430
with them still being active.

66
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.180
There's a lot of stuff we don't know.

67
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.170
- Right. we wanna make sure
that it's told correctly.

68
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.930
for one thing.

69
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.120
Of course. I also have
concerns about the fact

70
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.293
that the story doesn't have an ending.

71
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.232
- That's true.

72
00:04:28.232 --> 00:04:30.060
- One the one hand.
yes. that's very scary.

73
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.183
He could still be among us and all that.

74
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.043
On the other hand.

75
00:04:34.043 --> 00:04:36.490
we had three murders within four months

76
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.483
and then four months of nothing.

77
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.360
- That's where you come in.

78
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.300
Look. we know a lot about what's going on.

79
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.000
but it's safe to say that
there's a lot we don't know.

80
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.783
I say we spice it up a little bit.

81
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.150
Take a few artistic liberties.

82
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.900
- It could be artsy.

83
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.090
- Spice. okay. so...

84
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.410
What are you thinking?

85
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.223
- Well. now that you
ask. just bear with me.

86
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.100
Our killer. This is
all just a game to him.

87
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.510
But guess what? Regular season's over.

88
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.590
He's clenched his division.

89
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.490
He's in the playoffs with a bye week.

90
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.930
- I don't do sports.

91
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.210
- I follow you.

92
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.133
- He's planning.

93
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.690
Preparing for his next
big game. His Super Bowl.

94
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.270
A fucking blood bath!

95
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.150
- Okay. but...

96
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.310
Where's all the blood coming from?

97
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.150
There was dismemberment. yes.

98
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.770
There are parts missing
from the bodies found.

99
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.330
but the actual cause of
death was strangulation.

100
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.083
The mutilation was posthumous.

101
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.773
- She's right.

102
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.470
- Look. do you guys
wanna make a documentary

103
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.210
or a good movie?

104
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.000
- I'm sorry that these women's deaths

105
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.200
were not exciting enough for you. Seth!

106
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.560
- That's not what I meant.

107
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.550
- We don't know a lot
about the people involved.

108
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.330
Maybe there needs to be some research.

109
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.970
Like the killer. we don't even know

110
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.310
is he a good guy. bad guy?

111
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.390
- They're not a good person.

112
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.890
- He's a psychopath.

113
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.530
- Well. I mean. maybe. yeah.

114
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.940
It's worth mentioning. like you said.

115
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.653
there haven't been any
deaths in several months.

116
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.423
He could be done.

117
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.823
- Yeah.

118
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.260
All right. so we're talking
about spinning an ending

119
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.270
out of thin air.

120
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.250
We'll write down ideas.

121
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.000
make sure that everybody
feels heard in the scenario.

122
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.630
I'm putting Seth down for a blood bath.

123
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.480
total effing blood bath.

124
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.570
- Thank you.

125
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.320
- And Mark...

126
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.390
Done.

127
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.990
- Done.

128
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.253
- I'm just gonna write that. Done.

129
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.130
- And on that exciting note.

130
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.680
I think we're done for the day.

131
00:06:50.123 --> 00:06:52.623

- [Mara] Quickly. Truson!

145
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.410
I have a key! The jailer's a friend!

146
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.440
You must escape!

147
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.923
- [Truson] I can't leave. No.

148
00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:02.460
- [Mara] But why? I want to go with you!

149
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.650
- [Truson] No. Mara.

150
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.760
Running away is not the solution.

151
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.400
Don't you see?

152
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.200
We'll not find peace anywhere else

153
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.863
until we find it here first.

154
00:10:11.808 --> 00:10:14.800
- [Mara] But I fear for
your safety if you stay.

155
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.617
I know they mean to harm you.

162
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.003
- Hello?

163
00:12:03.738 --> 00:12:04.588
Is someone there?

164
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:24.511
(breathing heavily)

165
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.230
- Hello?

166
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.340
- [Holly] Mark?

167
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.640
- Holly?

168
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.610
- [Holly] Yeah.

169
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.000
Did I catch you at a bad time?

170
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.330
- Um. I'm...

171
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.750
No. no. this is fine.

172
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.510
What's up? Perfect time.

173
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.820
- [Holly] Okay.

174
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.263
I was just calling to say.

175
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.820
I hope that you didn't feel
like we drowned you out today.

176
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.930
You were kinda quiet.

177
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.930
I know I can be loud. and he can be loud.

178
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.493
And if we're gonna collaborate creatively.

179
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.830
everybody needs to feel
like they're being heard.

180
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.480
- Wow. that's really considerate of you

181
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.270
to think about me like that.

182
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.103
Thank you.

183
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.870
If I'm being honest.
lately I've been sort of...

184
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.970
stunted creatively and...

185
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.803
otherwise.

186
00:13:13.803 --> 00:13:14.636
It's like I...

187
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.820
I try to get out there.
you know. and step to it.

188
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.280
and it's just like I just don't have

189
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.520
any kind of motivation anymore
or inspiration. I don't know.

190
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.743
It's my fault. I guess.

191
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.583
- [Holly] No. no.

192
00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.933
I've felt the exact same way sometimes.

193
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.700
And. you know. no pressure.

194
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.270
I'm not trying to force you.

195
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.660
You can't force creativity. but.

196
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.310
you know. hopefully along the way

197
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.770
you will rediscover some of
your creativity and passion.

198
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.483
and hopefully I will get to see it.

199
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.883
- Yeah.

200
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.153
Thanks.

201
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.080
Thanks.

202
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.060
- [Holly] Anyway. that's it.

203
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.850
I'll let you get back to
whatever it is you're doing.

204
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.206
and see you at the next one.

205
00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:01.178
- Okay. yeah. see you then.

206
00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:03.595
(soft music)

207
00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:09.729
Huh.

208
00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:19.314
(eerie music)

209
00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:31.768
(ominous music)

210
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:42.374
(heavy breathing)

211
00:15:01.254 --> 00:15:04.254
(suspenseful music)

212
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:28.449
(music stops)

213
00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:31.930
(soft music)

214
00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:42.098
(ominous music)
(car honks)

215
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.007
(dramatic music)
(woman gasps)

216
00:15:44.007 --> 00:15:46.674
(woman screams)

217
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.140
- I'm gonna lose the fog.

218
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.970
because I don't remember the
last time that we had a fog

219
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.300
so thick you can barely see through it.

220
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.620
- But that would look so good on camera!

221
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.860
- I mean. maybe that's how it went.

222
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:09.334
(slap)

223
00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:10.167
- Oh! God!

224
00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:11.000
Ow! Ow!

225
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.035
Stop it! Stop it!

226
00:16:12.035 --> 00:16:14.170
(groaning)

227
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.910
- Okay. well how about this?

228
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.800
She's out on her late night jog. no fog.

229
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.140
Our stalker's been after her all night.

230
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.820
He's been sneaking around.
hiding behind bushes. trees.

231
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.653
- Okay.

232
00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:26.560
- Until...

233
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.713
he makes a mistake.

234
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.610
He steps on a stick.

235
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.250
She turns and notice. he panics!

236
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.160
He chases after her!

237
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.010
She runs to her nearest neighbor.

238
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.128
starts beating on the door!

239
00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.370
"Help. help. someone's gonna kill me!"

240
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.650
As the neighbor comes
through the door. boom!

241
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.320
Knife through the back and out the stomach

242
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.171
and blood goes everywhere!

243
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.338
(panting)

244
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.403
- Oh. that was for real? That was serious?

245
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.610
That is...

246
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.980
Did you read the articles on the kills?

247
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.440
I mean. that's not even close.

248
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.300
- I'm not...

249
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.050
I'm not trying to be critical...

250
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.163
but I'm gonna be.

251
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.740
This sounds like a very
generic slasher film.

252
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.170
- Generic?

253
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.050
How is this generic?

254
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.750
Look. what's different here
is that this could be anyone.

255
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.130
It could be your neighbor.

256
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.380
It could be your mom for all we know.

257
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.423
- No. Seth. it couldn't.

258
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.040
I think you're missing
what makes this whole thing

259
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.590
interesting and special.

260
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.380
and that's the fact that
it is a very specific story

261
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.810
that couldn't happen to just anyone.

262
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.975
The killer obviously has their own ideas.

263
00:17:35.975 --> 00:17:36.808
- Right.

264
00:17:36.808 --> 00:17:39.395
- And a very detail-oriented
way of doing this.

265
00:17:39.395 --> 00:17:40.228
- Exactly.

266
00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:41.160
- And we need to approach it

267
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.006
with that same level of observation...

268
00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:43.839
- Thank you.

269
00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:45.350
- [Holly] If this is the
story that we want to tell.

270
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.140
- Exactly. That's what I was gonna say.

271
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.570
- And it couldn't happen
to my neighbor or my mom.

272
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.440
because he has a type.

273
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.710
He has a profile that
he has been following.

274
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.100
And it's not just women.
- Right.

275
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.030
- Or even women...
- No.

276
00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.620
- In a specific age demographic.

277
00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.506
He has consistently targeted women...

278
00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:00.339
- Right.

279
00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:01.373
- With flower names.
- That remind him of his mom.

280
00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.248
- What?
- What?

281
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.470
- Oh. they all had flower names.

282
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.560
You know. there was Mary-Rose Jones.

283
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.920
There was Iris Johnson.

284
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.763
And then there was Heather Beech.

285
00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:13.157
- Huh!

286
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.983
Wow. that is something!

287
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.180
- The murder-lizer.

288
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.310
- What?

289
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.997
- It's like fertilizer. but with murder.

290
00:18:23.997 --> 00:18:25.200
- No.
- No. that's...

291
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.180
What?

292
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.400
- The petal clipper.

293
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.540
- Oh!

294
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.740
- The petal-phile.

295
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.810
- What? No!

296
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.710
- The greenhouse strangler.

297
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.950
- Awful.

298
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.290
- The botanist.

299
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.490
- Why are we doing this?

300
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.433
- The gardener.

301
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.940
- I don't hate gardener.

302
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.920
- See?

303
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.850
We don't have to decide
on the name right now.

304
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.290
but we take the imagery of
someone slashing a flower

305
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.670
then slashing a girl.

306
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.430
Flower. girl. flower. girl.

307
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.980
- No one gut slashed!

308
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.813
- Thank you.

309
00:18:53.813 --> 00:18:55.780
- The cause of death was...

310
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.730
strangulation.

311
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.490
- Exactly. strangulation.

312
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.770
There is. from what I read.

313
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.290
a very certain intimacy with strangulation

314
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.630
that's specific to the killer.

315
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.770
That's the whole point. right?

316
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.590
- Strangulation is boring!

317
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.400
The fans. they want entertainment!

318
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.053
They want blood. they want
screams. they want horror!

319
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.410
You know what?

320
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.610
Enough talking about it.

321
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.543
I'll show you.

322
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.473
Come outside.

323
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.167
I'm not gonna slash you.

324
00:19:33.926 --> 00:19:36.593
(anxious music)

325
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:52.901
(suspenseful music)

326
00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.920
(ax thuds)

327
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.670
- Welcome. class!

328
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.670
In today's lesson we will be talking

329
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.880
about two different things.

330
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.820
Fear...

331
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.360
and compromise.

332
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.020
For these lessons. I'll
need some assistance.

333
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.993
Any volunteers?

334
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.203
Holly?

335
00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:16.550
Ah. ah!

336
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.383
Take a knee.

337
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.290
- Can't wait for this lawsuit.

338
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.070
- Lesson number one.

339
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.520
Compromise.

340
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.640
The articles say the
victims were dismembered

341
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.600
post-mortem. correct?

342
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.480
- Yes.

343
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.730
I like that. I liked that.

344
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.070
But...

345
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.220
what do you say...

346
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.090
we just moved the
timeline up a little bit?

347
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.340
It still sticks to the dismemberment.

348
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.239
It's just right before death
instead of right after.

349
00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:45.100
I think you can agree that
that's not too big of a jump.

350
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.630
So. the killer has his victim tied up.

351
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:53.070
The camera's from below.
shooting up on our killer.

352
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.603
a position of dominance. of power!

353
00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.673
He takes her hand. tries to
build a little trust with her.

354
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.373
He places it down.

355
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.950
He starts. finger by...

356
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.783
finger!

357
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.133
Until she's nothing but
a bloody mess to hide.

358
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.370
- I don't understand what
you're talking about.

359
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.010
This killer. it's not
about empowering himself

360
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.650
or showing dominance over somebody else.

361
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.030
It's about getting
something inside of him out

362
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.443
that he doesn't want.

363
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.360
- Do you want to go back to
making commercials for my dad?

364
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.443
- Okay. All right.

365
00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:35.693
So. let's talk intimidation.

366
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.140
You have a weapon. You can lose a weapon.

367
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.070
You can drop a weapon. It
can be taken away from you.

368
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.730
You can even lose it in a
body at some point in time.

369
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.630
Now. if we wanna talk about fear.

370
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.950
if you're wanting to
sell the victim's fear...

371
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.783
Take a seat.

372
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.790
So if the idea that we're going with

373
00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.100
is that we're gonna sell
them on the victim's fear...

374
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.440
I want you to imagine that
you're sharing this moment

375
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.491
with someone that you trust.

376
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.324
(soft string music)

377
00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.210
And then. suddenly. this...

378
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.200
is the last thing. this face. these eyes.

379
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.550
are the last things that you see.

380
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.120
Imagine that realization.

381
00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.290
Imagine the intimacy. the
powerlessness of that moment.

382
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.410
And on his side. he's feeling
her pulse get sluggish.

383
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.860
He's feeling her breath
slow down and get shallower.

384
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.330
Don't worry about him.

385
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.180
There's no one in this
moment but him and her.

386
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.030
He doesn't need a weapon.

387
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.520
All he needs is the two of them.

388
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.010
Imagine he's wearing glasses
and we see them get fogged up

389
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.950
and fogged up until. suddenly...

390
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.330
he sees clear as day as the
light goes out of her eyes.

391
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.432
♪ The light goes out of her eyes ♪

392
00:22:45.432 --> 00:22:46.490
♪ Goes out of her eyes ♪

393
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.070
♪ Out of out of out of out of ♪

394
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.820
(energetic electronic music)

395
00:23:30.647 --> 00:23:32.124
(gasps)

396
00:23:32.124 --> 00:23:32.970
(coughs)

397
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.850
It's primal.

398
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:35.923
It's intimate.

399
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.203
It's terrifying.

400
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.910
Strangulation can be scary.

401
00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.323
Mark. do you wanna
chime in on any of this?

402
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.023
Nice! You freaked him out!

403
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.253
- I freaked him out?

404
00:23:56.109 --> 00:23:57.259
What the fuck was that?

405
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:03.182
(soft orchestral music)

406
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.393
- [Holly] Hey.

407
00:24:30.697 --> 00:24:32.610
do you care if I join you?

408
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.443
- Sure.

409
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.200
- So...

410
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.913
That's not my standard writing style.

411
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.263
- I believe that.

412
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.420
- This is why I write alone.

413
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.750
It's just...

414
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.023
It's more solitary.

415
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.570
And it's not that I'm against compromise.

416
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.310
It's just that...

417
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.933
I kind of am against compromise.

418
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.240
I don't know. Maybe it's an
only child thing. you know?

419
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.740
Never really learned to share?

420
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.400
- Actually. I started one of your books.

421
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.233
- Oh yeah?

422
00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:09.810
- Mm-hm. It's good.

423
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:10.690
- Thanks.

424
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.230
- I don't normally do true
crime stuff. but I like it.

425
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.743
There's a really good sense of detail.

426
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.743
- I appreciate it.

427
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.960
I mean. obviously. I don't
know how much of it is me.

428
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.860
That's the thing.

429
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.340
is that these are really
interesting stories.

430
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.320
They're already well-crafted.

431
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.730
You know?

432
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.320
That's why I don't understand the need

433
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.600
to add all this extra stuff

434
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.343
as if it isn't already
interesting on its own.

435
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.727
- Yeah.

436
00:25:40.727 --> 00:25:42.400
- I mean...

437
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.000
I know that you've
worked with Seth before.

438
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.280
I think he's a good guy.

439
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.990
I just think he's kinda got this...

440
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.010
scent of Hollywood in his nostrils.

441
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.960
and he's not really letting go of that.

442
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.830
- I could see that.

443
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.710
Although. in his defense...

444
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.990
maybe he's trying to figure
out where he belongs. you know?

445
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.163
It can be really tough to see
how you fit into the world.

446
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.140
- Yeah. maybe.

447
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.610
- You know. that was
pretty impressive earlier

448
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.543
with the names and the flowers.

449
00:26:18.037 --> 00:26:21.210
I didn't even notice that
myself. which is weird.

450
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.780
so that was pretty cool.

451
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.610
- Well. I mean. obviously
I didn't come up with it.

452
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.150
It's just the pattern
that was established.

453
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:28.983
I mean. that's the thing.

454
00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:30.780
If you pay attention.

455
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.973
the important information
becomes apparent.

456
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.250
- Yeah.

457
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.400
This may be weird to say.

458
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.940
but I always feel like
I'm pretty good at...

459
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.703
observing. finding information.

460
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.030
Doing photography. that's kind
of the point. is that you...

461
00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:52.943
watch someone and see if you
can figure out how they tick.

462
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.130
- Yeah.

463
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.813
It sounds like you have some
pretty interesting ideas.

464
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.360
And if you spoke up a
little more frequently.

465
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.973
we'd probably hear more of them.

466
00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.550
- Yeah.

467
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.490
- Anyway...

468
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.780
This has probably been a
cigarette's length of break.

469
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.283
so I'm gonna head inside and make nice.

470
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.840
- Hey. sorry if I was
kind of weird earlier

471
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.110
when I walked off.

472
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.400
- It's fine.

473
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.390
Probably creeped you out.

474
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.380
I can be a little scary sometimes.

475
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.323
Anyway. see you.

476
00:27:34.706 --> 00:27:35.792
(anxious music)

477
00:27:35.792 --> 00:27:38.459
(camera clicks)

478
00:27:42.387 --> 00:27:45.220
(birds whistling)

479
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.940
- So we can probably agree

480
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.793
that we all equally made that weird.

481
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.240
Obviously. I know a lot more
about the details of this case

482
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.550
because I've done a lot of research.

483
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.900
You know a lot about movies.

484
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.130
So there needs to be a
way for us to compromise

485
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.120
that does not involve axes or choking.

486
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.810
So...

487
00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.210
let's walk through the
hypothetical targeting

488
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.473
of Iris Johnson to her death.

489
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.152
So. they meet somewhere.

490
00:28:26.152 --> 00:28:28.500
(ball bounces)

491
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.333
- A bar.

492
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.720
It's loud. Lots of people.

493
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.883
He'd go unnoticed.

494
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.663
He sees Iris sitting at
the bar and approaches.

495
00:28:39.636 --> 00:28:42.330
(ball bouncing)

496
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.800
- Um...

497
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.030
He sees her.

498
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.790
She's wearing a white
blouse with purple flowers.

499
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.763
and she smells like lavender.

500
00:28:53.476 --> 00:28:56.570
(ball bounces)

501
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.813
- He approaches.

502
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.630
He buys her a drink.

503
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.370
They have a few
conversations. maybe a dance.

504
00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.240
They enjoy themselves.

505
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.630
He's got that kind of look.

506
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.730
But...

507
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.733
it's closing time.

508
00:29:11.415 --> 00:29:12.340
(ball bounces)

509
00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.850
- They head out to her car.

510
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.229
where her tire has been
mysteriously slashed.

511
00:29:19.229 --> 00:29:21.740
(ball bounces)

512
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.573
- There's a...

513
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.510
cartoon unicorn hanging
from the rear view mirror

514
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.160
and a yellow bumper sticker.

515
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.463
It's got a silly slogan on
it. It's torn on the corner.

516
00:29:36.554 --> 00:29:39.080
(ball bounces)

517
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.550
He offers her a ride home
like any gentlemen would.

518
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.200
She accepts. but...

519
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.120
he takes a turn when she
didn't tell him to...

520
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.932
down a dark. dark back road.

521
00:29:53.932 --> 00:29:54.765
(ball bounces)

522
00:29:54.765 --> 00:29:58.393
- She's obviously very nervous.
She goes for her cell phone.

523
00:29:59.382 --> 00:30:00.540
(ball bounces)

524
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.990
- He notices.

525
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.133
He panics and attacks!

526
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.623
But Iris is a little
stronger than the rest.

527
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.073
He pulls out a weapon.
Not a blade or a gun.

528
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.333
A wire.

529
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.650
You keep your strangulation...

530
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.180
- And you get your bloodshed.

531
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.373
That's good. That's really good.

532
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.190
She tries to get her
hand in between the wire

533
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.340
and her throat. but it's sharp.

534
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.370
It cuts into her fingers.

535
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.980
And he realizes that.

536
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.820
to make it harder to figure
out what the weapon was.

537
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.536
he's gonna need to remove the hand.

538
00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.789
(ball bounces)

539
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:42.180
- Do you think he would...

540
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.373
do anything?

541
00:30:47.316 --> 00:30:48.520
(ball bounces)

542
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.590
- Even if he did. we wouldn't
include it in the movie.

543
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.570
(somber music)

544
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.610
- Okay.

545
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.530
Even though he's obviously aroused.

546
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.681
he takes her back home
to dismember the body.

547
00:30:59.681 --> 00:31:00.600
(ball bounces)

548
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.750
- Would he take her home or
would he have something offsite?

549
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.973
- He wouldn't take her home.

550
00:31:05.973 --> 00:31:06.900
- Um...

551
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.940
Okay. so. maybe it's somewhere offsite.

552
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.900
And even if we assume that
something sexual happened.

553
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:15.848
we don't show it.

554
00:31:15.848 --> 00:31:16.980
(ball bounces)

555
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.020
- He definitely wouldn't do
those sexual deviant things

556
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.758
at his own house. right?

557
00:31:20.758 --> 00:31:21.740
(ball bounces)

558
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.010
- I mean. we don't know that.

559
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.920
But let's take it in
a different direction.

560
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.070
What if she's not attracted
to him at the bar?

561
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.313
Maybe he gives off a creepy vibe.

562
00:31:31.313 --> 00:31:32.600
(ball thuds)

563
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.130
- Maybe he's ugly.

564
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.600
Probably smells.

565
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.340
Maybe that's why he's so attracted
to the scent of lavender.

566
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.827
- Guys...

567
00:31:39.827 --> 00:31:40.660
(ball bounces)

568
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.900
- So. then she doesn't accept
his offer for a ride home.

569
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.810
and he attacks her right
outside of her own vehicle.

570
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.210
- I mean. what do you think?

571
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.773
- It's...

572
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.390
This whole sexual deviancy thing.

573
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.300
you guys are really just
flying off the handle.

574
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.240
What's this...

575
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.350
It's completely off track.

576
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.940
It's nothing like the report said.

577
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.133
I don't understand what you're doing.

578
00:32:02.133 --> 00:32:03.790
None of that happened. okay?

579
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.990
I read the articles.
That's not how it went.

580
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.170
- Um...

581
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.170
Okay. well...

582
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.350
floor's yours.

583
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.060
What do you think? What drew him to her?

584
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.663
Why is he doing what he's doing?

585
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.550
- Maybe he sees a certain
style of clothing.

586
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.370
and it reminds him of
somebody that he knew before

587
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.563
that he hated or he
wanted and couldn't have.

588
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.817
He's drawn to 'em.

589
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.786
(ball bouncing)

590
00:32:39.826 --> 00:32:42.320
- I don't know that...

591
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.150
killers are big followers
of fashion. Mark.

592
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:49.483
But. I mean. it's a good
note. We'll think it over.

593
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.640
I do like the idea of
exploring the common theme

594
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.220
besides just the names with these women.

595
00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.330
So. maybe...

596
00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.930
I don't know. maybe we can...

597
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.050
get to know them a little bit
better in whatever way we can.

598
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:09.050
I can go to where someone
worked. maybe talk to a coworker.

599
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.310
- I've got a list of acquaintances.

600
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.810
I could see if they missed
anything in the report.

601
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.033
- If I need to. there's
something I can do.

602
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.390
- Great.

603
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.578
So we've all got our homework.

604
00:33:21.578 --> 00:33:22.962
(ball bounces)

605
00:33:22.962 --> 00:33:24.295
- Yay. homework.

606
00:33:27.412 --> 00:33:31.329
(sentimental orchestral music)

607
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.900
- Quickly. Truson!

608
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.940
I have a key! The jailer's a friend!

609
00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:46.773
You must escape!

610
00:33:46.773 --> 00:33:48.453
- [Truson] I can't leave. No.

611
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:52.940
- [Mara] But why? I want to go with you!

612
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.260
- [Truson] No. Mara. Running
away is not the solution.

613
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.890
Don't you see?

614
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.710
We'll not find peace anywhere else

615
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.266
until we find it here first.

616
00:34:02.266 --> 00:34:05.335
- [Mara] but I fear for
your safety if you stay!

617
00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:07.247
I know they mean to harm you.

618
00:34:07.247 --> 00:34:10.156
- [Truson] You said you were
willing to run away with me.

619
00:34:10.156 --> 00:34:13.030
Are you just as willing
to stay here in Hamelin?

620
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.913
Stand beside me while I fight?

621
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.360
- [Mara] Yes. my darling.

(footsteps)

649
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:22.040
- Sorry for the wait.

650
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.600
I was finishing a wreath.

651
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.790
- No problem.

652
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.440
- It was for funeral.

653
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.370
- Oh.

654
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.390
Sorry.

655
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.300
- Ah. no. don't be.

656
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.183
The murders have actually
been really good for business.

657
00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:33.016
- Oh.

658
00:37:33.016 --> 00:37:33.849
Silver lining.

659
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.670
- So you're here to talk about Heather.

660
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:40.083
- Yeah. Can you tell
me a little about her?

661
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.230
- Not much to tell.

662
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.560
I didn't know her all that well.

663
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.860
She was cool though.

664
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.483
You know. funny.

665
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.763
She got all of her work done
on time. so good for her.

666
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.530
- So. did she seem okay

667
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.560
in the days leading up
to her disappearance?

668
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.700
Was she acting out of character?

669
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.100
- Oh. you know. she was
pretty normal. actually.

670
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:07.400
- She had a date. though.
that she was going on.

671
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.802
You know. so...

672
00:38:08.802 --> 00:38:10.700
(slams flowers)
good for them.

673
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.400
- Yeah? Did you get
his name by any chance?

674
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.610
- No. but she had a lot of dates.

675
00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:19.170
so it wasn't anything unusual. you know.

676
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.270
None of them were me. though.

677
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:23.147
'cause that would be unprofessional.

678
00:38:23.147 --> 00:38:25.260
(tool bangs)

679
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.010
- Right.

680
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.963
- And she said no.

681
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.680
- So you don't know anything about...

682
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.450
who he was or maybe what he did?

683
00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:35.283
- No.

684
00:38:35.283 --> 00:38:37.253
I mean. I saw a picture of him though.

685
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.310
- Really? Could you describe him for me?

686
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.710
- He was a pretty average
looking guy. reddish brown hair.

687
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.533
Pretty average height.

688
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.203
Basic build.

689
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.560
I do not remember the color of his eyes.

690
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.670
- Very descriptive.

691
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:57.630
- Brian!

692
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.867
Get back to work!

693
00:38:58.867 --> 00:38:59.760
(sighs)

694
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.030
- Well. hey. I gotta get back to it.

695
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.390
Listen. be sure if you
write about the murders

696
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.400
and everything that you
mention the name of this shop.

697
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.233
all right?

698
00:39:08.233 --> 00:39:11.050
It would be really super
helpful for business.

699
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.593
All right?

700
00:39:12.593 --> 00:39:15.010
(chattering)

701
00:39:20.352 --> 00:39:22.852
(eerie music)

702
00:39:28.272 --> 00:39:31.772
(computer mouse clicking)

703
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.203
- Poor girl.

704
00:39:55.411 --> 00:39:58.911
(somber orchestral music)

705
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.020
- I'm just so happy that you're here

706
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.340
and that we get to have this together

707
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.540
without somebody
constantly interrupting us.

708
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.963
That's probably too much.

709
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.280
I feel like we connect. you know?

710
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.238
Like you really see me...

711
00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:49.281
in a way that other people don't.

712
00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:51.700
(disturbing music)

713
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.533
Holly...

714
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.544
would you like to stay here with me?

715
00:40:56.544 --> 00:40:57.620
(phone beeps)

716
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.453
One sec.

717
00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:25.393
Just a work thing.

718
00:41:27.115 --> 00:41:28.638
What were you saying?

719
00:41:28.638 --> 00:41:31.904
(soft orchestral music)

720
00:41:31.904 --> 00:41:32.737
Right.

721
00:41:39.317 --> 00:41:41.984
(ominous music)

722
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.953
- Okay. check it out.

723
00:41:48.953 --> 00:41:52.380
These are all photos from
Heather Beech's social accounts.

724
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.820
What do you see?

725
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.120
- A bar mitzvah.

726
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.063
- Cute lady and her nephew?

727
00:41:59.227 --> 00:42:01.440
- What about this one? Look close.

728
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.713
- Football and failure.

729
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.010
- I like her top.

730
00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.210
- Jesus. Sherlock! The necklace!

731
00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:10.330
Look. she's wearing a necklace
in all of these photos.

732
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.623
Birthdays. New Year's. date night.

733
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.523
They never found that necklace.

734
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.210
- I don't wanna blow your mind right now.

735
00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.830
but people do take off their jewelry.

736
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.680
- Yeah. yeah. so what?

737
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.547
- I talked to her family last night.

738
00:42:26.547 --> 00:42:27.960
- You...

739
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.456
You talked to her family?

740
00:42:29.456 --> 00:42:30.289
That's-

741
00:42:30.289 --> 00:42:31.330
- That's not the point.

742
00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.040
This isn't just some normal necklace.

743
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.940
Her mother gave it to her before she died.

744
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.910
Why would she stop wearing this necklace

745
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.890
on the night she was murdered?

746
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.730
- I mean. like. I know
you love your bracelet.

747
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.470
but not everybody wears jewelry every day.

748
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.000
- You said it yourself.

749
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.750
He likes something that she's
wearing. and he wants it.

750
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.590
It could be jewelry.

751
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.950
He's taking these things as a trophy.

752
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.240
- What about these stories?

753
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.460
Have you read all of these
or just the ones with photos?

754
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.940
- Okay. assuming that the police

755
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.150
already have all of this information.

756
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.520
what does your discovery mean

757
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.510
for what we're doing right now?

758
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.840
- I was thinking...

759
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.230
maybe we try to tackle this
from a different angle.

760
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.290
- Okay.

761
00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.993
- Instead of the dark and
brooding silent killer.

762
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.973
what if we kick it up a notch?

763
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.483
Maybe he's charismatic. a little flashy.

764
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.000
Woos women?

765
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.053
Takes the jury as trophies.

766
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.393
- So like if Batman were a criminal.

767
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.570
- Batman.

768
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.170
Robin's lame.

769
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.810
- I just don't know that
people are gonna wanna watch

770
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.690
a movie about a rich. good-looking guy

771
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.210
literally getting away with murder.

772
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.540
- You wanna know what I think?

773
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.590
I think you're jealous.

774
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.390
You come in here thinking
you know everything

775
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.170
about serial killers and murderers.

776
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:48.080
But you know what?

777
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.330
Captain true crime
didn't come up with shit!

778
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.820
- Fuck you. Seth!

779
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.810
- Fuck me!

780
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.470
- Yeah. I'm sorry I
didn't get any great info

781
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.710
from her coworkers she barely talked to.

782
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.750
I didn't get all invasive with her family.

783
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.180
You know. you're a
well-dressed. good-looking guy.

784
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.010
Do you care if we go
rifle through your room

785
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:08.294
and see what you're hanging on to?

786
00:44:08.294 --> 00:44:09.133
- You know what?
- Guys. guys. just calm down.

787
00:44:09.133 --> 00:44:11.210
- I stuck my neck out for you!

788
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.820
- To who? Yourself?

789
00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.710
- Oh. please!

790
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:15.370
Look. I've seen your book numbers.

791
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.483
You need this just as bad as I do.

792
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.946
- This is bullshit.

793
00:44:19.946 --> 00:44:21.946
(sighs)

794
00:44:27.846 --> 00:44:30.714
(door slams)

795
00:44:30.714 --> 00:44:32.714
(sighs)

796
00:44:34.804 --> 00:44:37.417
- I'm gonna end up just like you.

797
00:44:37.417 --> 00:44:42.417
(emotional music)
(birds whistling)

798
00:45:08.466 --> 00:45:09.299
Hey.

799
00:45:10.286 --> 00:45:11.700
- Hey.

800
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.617
- You okay?

801
00:45:14.404 --> 00:45:15.821
- Yeah. I'm okay.

802
00:45:23.547 --> 00:45:24.533
What's that?

803
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:27.430
- Indirect peace offering?

804
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.193
- Well. I wouldn't have said no

805
00:45:35.193 --> 00:45:38.510
to something stronger
than water. but thanks.

806
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:39.343
- Yeah.

807
00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.720
Stuff got pretty heated in there.

808
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.050
- I know. I'm...

809
00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:48.250
I'm sorry about the whole tantrum.

810
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:52.893
He just seems to have a unique
ability to push my buttons.

811
00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.900
- Do you guys have a...

812
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.770
Like a past?

813
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.390
Maybe you dated?

814
00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:00.660
- No!

815
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.850
No. we just...

816
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.973
fundamentally disagree about
how to tell this story.

817
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.400
- Right.

818
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.200
- I mean. I knew there would
be creative differences.

819
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.093
but not like this.

820
00:46:13.994 --> 00:46:15.680
I was already iffy about...

821
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.030
bringing fame and notoriety
to this person anyway.

822
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.520
And now we're talking about glamorizing

823
00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.033
what this sicko's doing?

824
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.880
- Well...

825
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.070
I mean. before you said it
was really interesting. right?

826
00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.540
- Yeah. it's interesting.

827
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.883
But that doesn't make
it good or sympathetic.

828
00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.173
- Yeah.

829
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.420
- I just think it could
be really harmful to...

830
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:51.130
portray this killer as a hot. cool guy.

831
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.860
I know that they think

832
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.570
that they're doing something important

833
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.621
or maybe even artistic with
this. but they're not there.

834
00:46:58.621 --> 00:47:00.650
They're just killing people.

835
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.760
- What about the whole
gray area in writing.

836
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.410
where characters aren't all
good or all bad. you know?

837
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.940
- Right. but there is still
good and there is still bad.

838
00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.990
And I think the good are
the people that were killed.

839
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.550
You know. they should
be living their lives

840
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:17.580
but that chance was taken away from them

841
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.913
by this person for their
own twisted reasons.

842
00:47:20.913 --> 00:47:22.490
(tense music)
It's not cool.

843
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:23.360
It's not glamorous.

844
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.230
It's sick. It's obsessive.

845
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.581
They are a murderer!

846
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:27.414
(cup crunches)
(water splashing)

847
00:47:27.414 --> 00:47:28.730
Shit!

848
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:30.780
Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry!

849
00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.840
Shit!

850
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.420
Yeah. yeah.

851
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.900
- You are soaked!

852
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:35.733
- I'm sorry.

853
00:47:35.733 --> 00:47:38.130
- Should we just call it for the day?

854
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.090
Do you need to go home?

855
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.250
- No. I...

856
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.650
In my line of work. you need
to keep extra clothes on hand.

857
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.040
so I can change.

858
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.030
It's fine.

859
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.863
- Okay.

860
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.103
Go for it.

861
00:47:52.103 --> 00:47:52.936
- Sorry.

862
00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:55.250
- Yeah. I'll just take
a minute to cool down.

863
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.600
and then we can go back in.

864
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.504
Promise not to peak!

865
00:48:01.504 --> 00:48:04.337
(emotional music)

866
00:48:26.235 --> 00:48:28.235
(sighs)

867
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:39.373
You ready?

868
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.153
- Yeah.

869
00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:47.046
(car door shuts)

870
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:52.109
(sighs)

871
00:48:53.386 --> 00:48:55.803
(door opens)

872
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.003
- So...

873
00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.433
I regret some things.

874
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.883
I'm sorry about what I
said. I was way out of line.

875
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.683
To be completely honest. it's
not even really accurate.

876
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.713
I actually did research your book sales.

877
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.863
Pretty damn good.

878
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.800
Better than anything I've ever done.

879
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.553
Mark...

880
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.500
did you know that we are
currently working with a member

881
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.500
of John Anderson's top 200
true crime authors of 2020?

882
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.750
- Yeah.

883
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.940
- Did you already know that about me.

884
00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.600
or did you look it up when
I was outside just now?

885
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.930
- Does that really matter a little yet?

886
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:58.243
- A little. yes!

887
00:49:58.243 --> 00:49:59.160
- Whatever.

888
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:01.693
- So where has this Seth been?

889
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.007
- Under a lot of stress.

890
00:50:04.007 --> 00:50:04.840
(soft music)

891
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.670
- Well. I like him. He's very charming.

892
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.493
Well. I like him. He's
very charming. charming.

893
00:50:10.493 --> 00:50:13.410
(disturbing music)

894
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.313
I need to be receptive to
ideas that aren't mine.

895
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.520
I'm sorry.

896
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.560
And it was really fucked up

897
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.080
to imply that you were a murderer.

898
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.760
I don't even know where that came from.

899
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.760
- I mean. I do kind of look the part.

900
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.970
- Well. you do dress really well.

901
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.270
Okay.

902
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.393
So. tell me about your
charming. magnetic killer.

903
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.463
- How about I show you?

904
00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:23.990
- An act out?

905
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.823
- Act out!

906
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.920
I've been thinking about
this one for a little while.

907
00:51:31.418 --> 00:51:32.523
This here.

908
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.130
Just a second.

909
00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.013
Just a second.

910
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.500
Holly?

911
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.290
- No! Why do I always
have to be the victim?

912
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.500
- Do you really need to ask that?

913
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.470
Holly? Flower names?

914
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:50.220
Serial killer?

915
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.010
- Holly is not a flower. It's a plant.

916
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.073
- Close enough.

917
00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:55.600
- Mark!

918
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.850
You haven't done one yet.

919
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.420
Grab a seat.

920
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.230
- I'm good. thanks. No.

921
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:02.110
- Come on. man.

922
00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.700
- Be a team player! We're on a team now.

923
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.533
- Go team!

924
00:52:07.003 --> 00:52:09.003
(sighs)

925
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.920
Okay.

926
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.219
All right.

927
00:52:17.219 --> 00:52:21.530
In this scenario. our killer
has our victim in a chair.

928
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.173
hands tied behind their back.

929
00:52:25.304 --> 00:52:26.254
Behind on the back.

930
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.138
Come on.

931
00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:29.300
(soft music)

932
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.133
All right.

933
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:35.553
So at this point. our victim is terrified.

934
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:37.503
Alone.

935
00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:40.650
She doesn't know what's coming next.

936
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.130
Is he making an advance?

937
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:46.690
- Okay! Can we stop?

938
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.650
Is that really necessary?

939
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:50.523
- Your hands are supposed to be tied up.

940
00:52:51.524 --> 00:52:53.174
- Come on. man. Behind your back.

941
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.983
- Okay.

942
00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.940
- All right.

943
00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.960
As I was saying...

944
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.820
is he making an advance...

945
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:05.960
or...

946
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.694
is he just gonna blow
his fucking brains out?

947
00:53:07.694 --> 00:53:09.675
- Whoa!
- What the fuck?

948
00:53:09.675 --> 00:53:11.170
Is this real?

949
00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:12.380
- Why would I have a fake gun?

950
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.430
- [Holly] Is it loaded?

951
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.970
- No. it's not loaded!

952
00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:16.500
- What do you even have that?

953
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.480
- Um. there's a murderer on the loose.

954
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.380
- Don't point guns at
your friends. you weirdo!

955
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.260
- You're right. you're right. I'm sorry.

956
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.180
But did you see the look on his face?

957
00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.640
He didn't know what was gonna happen next!

958
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.390
- You were pretty scared.

959
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.290
- Yeah. there was a gun.

960
00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.763
- Damn near pissed his pants.

961
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.600
- Are we done? Is that it?

962
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.300
- So how are you feeling about it?

963
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.530
I feel like you watched a lot of movies

964
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.710
over the last 20 years.

965
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.940
you regurgitated them into this cliche.

966
00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:49.970
and we just did that.

967
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:53.491
It's like an animal with no
brain trying to create art.

968
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:54.324
- Okay.

969
00:53:54.324 --> 00:53:55.980
- Wow.

970
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.010
Well. you know. you're a big guy

971
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.410
sitting in his friend's living room.

972
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.440
You've got to put yourself
in the state of mind

973
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.260
of one of these victims.

974
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.740
You are a bright. accomplished young woman

975
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.090
with people who love her.

976
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:12.790
You should have your
whole life ahead of you.

977
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:15.610
but you put your trust
in the wrong person.

978
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:20.610
and now your whole life is
in the hands of this monster.

979
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:21.760
- Damn you're good.

980
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:26.830
- Okay.

981
00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.110
Sure.

982
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.610
- So...

983
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:30.443
try again.

984
00:54:30.443 --> 00:54:31.950
Think like that.

985
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:32.800
- All right then.

986
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:34.980
Hands behind your back.

987
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.660
As I was saying...

988
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:46.750
he's had this victim for
weeks. living off scraps.

989
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.933
She's hungry. weak.

990
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:53.813
Not knowing what's coming next.

991
00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.500
Her dreams. her aspirations
all fading away...

992
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.140
all with just a tight squeeze.

993
00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.630
- Stop. stop. stop! Okay?

994
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:08.980
Take a fucking second and
do something that matters!

995
00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.320
You're not accomplishing anything!

996
00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.780
What are you doing? Are
you gonna be in the movie?

997
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.460
Why are we doing this? Are you acting?

998
00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.280
We're just spinning our tires!

999
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.780
How many times have we met up?

1000
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.070
I'm gonna take a second
and leave and do something

1001
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.770
to actually help us push
this story forward. you know.

1002
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:25.603
figure something out.

1003
00:55:25.603 --> 00:55:26.630
If you guys wanna do the same.

1004
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:29.110
maybe you should do that and
we can get something done.

1005
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.110
Okay?

1006
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:32.253
I'm sorry. I just. I gotta go.

1007
00:55:36.882 --> 00:55:38.890
- Was it something I said?

1008
00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.423
- You pointed a gun at him!

1009
00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.453
- Too much?

1010
00:55:46.424 --> 00:55:48.924
(eerie music)

1011
00:56:02.887 --> 00:56:05.887
(crickets chirping)

1012
00:56:07.217 --> 00:56:10.050
(startling music)

1013
00:56:31.295 --> 00:56:33.050
- Oh! (laughs)

1014
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:33.960
You must be Mark.

1015
00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:34.970
- Yeah. Daisy?

1016
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:36.780
- Yeah. it's nice to meet you!

1017
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.400
- Yeah. you too.

1018
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.233
You...

1019
00:56:39.233 --> 00:56:40.553
- Yeah. you wanna sit down?

1020
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:44.560
- So. this is a nice park.

1021
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.143
- It's really nice. It's
been a beautiful day.

1022
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.917
- You would think. You would think.

1023
00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:53.060
- Did you have a rough day?

1024
00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.370
- Yeah. work stuff. It was kinda bad.

1025
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.203
- I hear ya.

1026
00:56:57.203 --> 00:56:58.484
Yeah. work. Ugh.

1027
00:56:58.484 --> 00:56:59.317
(laughs)

1028
00:56:59.317 --> 00:57:00.850
- What do you do?

1029
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.290
- I am an art teacher
for middle schoolers.

1030
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.123
- Wow!

1031
00:57:05.123 --> 00:57:05.970
- Mm-hm.

1032
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:06.960
- That must be...

1033
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.053
unbearable.

1034
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.170
- Um...

1035
00:57:13.679 --> 00:57:14.910
not really.

1036
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.950
I mean. I love to teach
art. and I love kids.

1037
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.530
so it's been...

1038
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:20.500
It's pretty fulfilling.

1039
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.770
It can have its challenges
though. Definitely.

1040
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:26.670
- I'm actually pretty
creative myself. I guess.

1041
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:27.797
I'm a photographer.

1042
00:57:27.797 --> 00:57:28.630
- Oh!

1043
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:30.490
- And I work on some film
projects here and there.

1044
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.014
getting into that.

1045
00:57:32.014 --> 00:57:34.600
- Wow! That sounds like fun.

1046
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.870
- Well. sometimes.

1047
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:38.790
I actually had a meeting
today that kind of went crazy.

1048
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:40.490
like I was saying.

1049
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:43.320
They won't really listen to
me and take my input on stuff.

1050
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.980
And it's actually a topic
that I know all about

1051
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.440
and they won't even recognize that

1052
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.220
and listen to what I have to say.

1053
00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.810
And it gets really frustrating.

1054
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.010
and I'm not really sure
what to do about it.

1055
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.713
I don't know.

1056
00:57:55.713 --> 00:57:56.800
I'm rambling though. Sorry.

1057
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.060
- Well. I mean. it's hard
when you're not heard.

1058
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.190
I can understand that.

1059
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:02.410
And don't worry about the rambling.

1060
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.380
I'm pretty nervous myself.

1061
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.683
This is my first time.

1062
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.880
- On a date?

1063
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.490
- Oh. well...

1064
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:13.380
My first time on a date app.

1065
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.730
I was in this long-term relationship.

1066
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:17.680
It just didn't work out.

1067
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.620
It's been a long time.

1068
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:22.800
and my best friend pretty
much pushed me into this.

1069
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.730
- I actually have the same
kind of problem going on.

1070
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:26.000
There's this girl that I'm working with.

1071
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.350
the thing from today.

1072
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:30.260
Like. she really sees me
for me. which is impossible.

1073
00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.340
So it was so great!

1074
00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.620
And I really feel like
she could be the one.

1075
00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.270
But suddenly I find out

1076
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:37.173
she's going behind my
back right in front of me

1077
00:58:37.173 --> 00:58:38.630
with this douche bag named Seth.

1078
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:39.822
and I don't know what to do.

1079
00:58:39.822 --> 00:58:40.790
Like. that really...

1080
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:41.900
It hurts!

1081
00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.357
- [Daisy] Yeah. I'm sure.

1082
00:58:43.357 --> 00:58:44.690
I'm sure that was heartbreaking.

1083
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:46.173
- Yeah. Yeah. it is.

1084
00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:50.370
- So is this someone
you're currently seeing?

1085
00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:52.793
I mean. are y'all still in contact?

1086
00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.773
- Not at the moment. it seems.

1087
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:03.950
This is going well!

1088
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:05.010
You wanna get outta here?

1089
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:05.843
- Um...

1090
00:59:05.843 --> 00:59:07.470
Well. you know...

1091
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:08.390
Really...

1092
00:59:09.988 --> 00:59:11.230
Oh my gosh!

1093
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:13.780
My babysitter has to leave in 30 minutes.

1094
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.370
She got school tomorrow.
so I really can't.

1095
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:17.257
What are you doing?
- It won't take long.

1096
00:59:17.257 --> 00:59:18.090
(ominous music)

1097
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:18.923
- Let go of me!

1098
00:59:18.923 --> 00:59:20.163
- Just come. Come on.

1099
00:59:20.163 --> 00:59:20.996
Just-
(purse thuds)

1100
00:59:20.996 --> 00:59:22.413
- Fuckin' weirdo!

1101
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:33.281
(sighs)
(phone beeps)

1102
00:59:33.558 --> 00:59:36.225
(ominous music)

1103
00:59:55.326 --> 00:59:58.159
(birds whistling)

1104
01:00:01.869 --> 01:00:04.286
(soft music)

1105
01:01:19.248 --> 01:01:21.748
(phone beeps)

1106
01:01:47.527 --> 01:01:50.027
(phone beeps)

1107
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.500
(phone beeps)

1108
01:02:38.343 --> 01:02:40.926
(slams jacket)

1109
01:02:57.344 --> 01:03:00.011
(anxious music)

1110
01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:16.772
(clock ticking)

1111
01:03:55.536 --> 01:03:57.623
(sniffling)

1112
01:03:57.623 --> 01:04:01.013
(feet shuffling)

1113
01:04:01.013 --> 01:04:02.426
(metal plunks)

1114
01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:03.426
- So stupid!

1115
01:04:05.987 --> 01:04:07.627
You're a sick...

1116
01:04:07.627 --> 01:04:08.460
(banging head)

1117
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.380
stupid...

1118
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.623
twisted...

1119
01:04:11.623 --> 01:04:12.456
freak.

1120
01:04:14.691 --> 01:04:17.155
Everybody was right.
You're not gonna change.

1121
01:04:17.155 --> 01:04:19.678
You're not gonna be somebody else.

1122
01:04:19.678 --> 01:04:23.524
(emotional orchestral music)

1123
01:04:23.524 --> 01:04:24.357
(crying)

1124
01:04:24.357 --> 01:04:25.930
Gonna lose her!

1125
01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.573
He's filling her head with all this shit!

1126
01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:31.460
She's gonna go.

1127
01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.460
(breathing heavily)

1128
01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.954
(eerie music)

1129
01:04:37.954 --> 01:04:38.787
Unless...

1130
01:04:42.396 --> 01:04:43.850
Unless I make a gesture.

1131
01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:44.800
Do you think...

1132
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.033
if I gave her that?

1133
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.280
I know that it's special to you.

1134
01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.953
but she's so special to me. and
I just have to do something.

1135
01:04:57.545 --> 01:05:01.295
(emotional orchestral music)

1136
01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:06.732
Yeah?

1137
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:13.468
(ominous music)

1138
01:05:21.394 --> 01:05:24.061
(crying softly)

1139
01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:26.555
Thank you.

1140
01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:43.230
(ticking)

1141
01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:01.413
(knocking on door)

1142
01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:06.803
- Mark!

1143
01:06:06.803 --> 01:06:07.636
What's up. man?

1144
01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:08.743
- Hey.
- You busy?

1145
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.090
- Yeah. actually...

1146
01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:13.550
Yeah.

1147
01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:17.250
- Well. I was just in the
neighborhood and was wondering

1148
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.200
if you had some time to
talk about a few shots.

1149
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.690
- Yeah. um...

1150
01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:23.890
Okay. Yeah.

1151
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.120
- I mean. I know we're meeting tomorrow.

1152
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.560
but I feel like if I bring
it up in front of Holly.

1153
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.610
she's just gonna shoot
me down anyway. you know?

1154
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:33.490
- She won't listen to
anything I have to say.

1155
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.003
You know I have good ideas.

1156
01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.390
Think about the commercial
we shot a few months back.

1157
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:39.610
My idea.

1158
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:41.950
Revenues 50% up.

1159
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.580
- Yeah. it was good.

1160
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.766
I thought you did a good job with that.

1161
01:06:45.766 --> 01:06:47.360
(soft music)

1162
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.950
Do you think it's a good idea
to be out here right now?

1163
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:51.300
Is it safe with everything?

1164
01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.280
- Unless your name's Lily or Rose.

1165
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.270
I don't think I have much to worry about.

1166
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:57.600
Plus...

1167
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.126
I've got a little extra protection.

1168
01:06:59.126 --> 01:07:01.960
(anxious music)

1169
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.793
- Yeah.

1170
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.340
- That your shop?

1171
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.750
I didn't know you were a car guy.

1172
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.724
- No. That was my stepdad's.

1173
01:07:10.724 --> 01:07:14.053
- Your stepdad owns a
shop in your backyard?

1174
01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.393
- He's dead.

1175
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:21.900
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

1176
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.250
I didn't know.

1177
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:24.083
- It's nothing.

1178
01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.980
Why don't we go check out this...

1179
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.853
location that I saw the
other day. this cool spot.

1180
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.850
Maybe you'll like it. I can get my camera.

1181
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:37.935
We can take some shots if you want.

1182
01:07:37.935 --> 01:07:38.768
- Yeah.

1183
01:07:38.768 --> 01:07:39.890
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1184
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:40.820
That sounds like a good idea.

1185
01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.250
Is it around here?

1186
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.670
- Yeah. it's close. Yeah.

1187
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:44.580
I'll get my camera.

1188
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.630
- Yeah. yeah. I'll wait inside.

1189
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.397
- Just hang out out here though.

1190
01:07:49.397 --> 01:07:51.930
It's kind of a mess.
There's a lot of garbage.

1191
01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:52.763
- Yeah.

1192
01:07:52.763 --> 01:07:54.150
- It's just kinda smelly.
It's embarrassing.

1193
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.990
- No problem.

1194
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.740
- All right. I'll be right back.

1195
01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.573
- Yeah.

1196
01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.640
Hey. you dropped your...

1197
01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:07.438
(mysterious music)

1198
01:08:07.438 --> 01:08:10.188
(dramatic music)

1199
01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:28.810
(door opens)

1200
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:29.643
- All right.

1201
01:08:29.643 --> 01:08:30.476
- Hey. look...

1202
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:35.043
It was rude of me to come
over tonight unannounced.

1203
01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:38.670
We can pick back up on
this tomorrow. all right?

1204
01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.330
- Okay. Yeah.

1205
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.060
- We've got a busy day. Don't wanna...

1206
01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.274
- Yeah. sure.

1207
01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:49.191
- Tomorrow.

1208
01:08:57.331 --> 01:09:00.081
(dramatic music)

1209
01:09:30.794 --> 01:09:33.211
(car starts)

1210
01:10:07.689 --> 01:10:10.356
(phone ringing)

1211
01:10:11.398 --> 01:10:12.340
- [Holly] Hey. what's up?

1212
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.463
- Hey. can you come meet me now?

1213
01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.400
- [Holly] Right now?

1214
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.098
- Yeah. there's something I
need to talk to you about.

1215
01:10:21.098 --> 01:10:22.630
- [Holly] Everything okay?

1216
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:24.343
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1217
01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.493
I'm at a location I was showing
Seth. I can drop you a pin.

1218
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.850
- [Holly] In town?

1219
01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:31.850
- Yeah. not too far.

1220
01:10:33.675 --> 01:10:37.466
- [Holly] Okay. yeah. Give
me about five minutes.

1221
01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:39.030
- Okay.

1222
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:41.113
- I'll see you soon. Bye.

1223
01:10:51.311 --> 01:10:54.311
(suspenseful music)

1224
01:11:27.174 --> 01:11:28.007
Mark?

1225
01:11:29.604 --> 01:11:32.271
(anxious music)

1226
01:11:37.235 --> 01:11:38.068
Mark?

1227
01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.468
(phone beeping)

1228
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:52.337
(ominous music)

1229
01:11:54.391 --> 01:11:55.224
Shit!

1230
01:11:56.823 --> 01:11:59.490
(phone beeping)

1231
01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:08.905
(dramatic music)

1232
01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:11.572
(Holly screams)

1233
01:12:15.443 --> 01:12:17.561
- Shh. shh. shh. shh. shh. shh. shh.

1234
01:12:17.561 --> 01:12:19.633
It's okay. It's okay.

1235
01:12:19.633 --> 01:12:20.466
It's okay.

1236
01:12:29.336 --> 01:12:31.836
(car beeping)

1237
01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.313
(emotional music)

1238
01:12:38.785 --> 01:12:40.980
(traffic rushing)

1239
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.480
(rain hitting windshield)

1240
01:13:28.255 --> 01:13:32.258
- What are you doing.
Mark? What are you doing?

1241
01:13:32.258 --> 01:13:34.571
(ticking)

1242
01:13:34.571 --> 01:13:36.988
(soft music)

1243
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:45.313
- We're home.

1244
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.470
So sorry that I have to do it...

1245
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:54.350
like this. but I think you're
gonna be really excited

1246
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:56.040
whenever you see what I'm doing here.

1247
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.650
because I want you to be a
part of the story. all right?

1248
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.050
You're not like the other girls.

1249
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.240
You're different. okay? You're...

1250
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.340
You're special. all right?

1251
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.043
There's something about
you that they don't have.

1252
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.470
And you seem to get me in such a way

1253
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.340
that makes me feel like I'm alive.

1254
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.260
And I just. I want you to know that. okay?

1255
01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.239
- Not another step. Mark!

1256
01:14:17.239 --> 01:14:19.120
(tense music)

1257
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.083
- Seth?

1258
01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:22.773
What's going on?

1259
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.660
- Why don't you tell me what's going on.

1260
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.469
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1261
01:14:29.469 --> 01:14:32.290
We were working on the
movie and she got sick.

1262
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:34.063
- No. No more lies. Mark.

1263
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.793
- I swear!

1264
01:14:35.793 --> 01:14:36.892
If you just let me get
her. she'll tell you.

1265
01:14:36.892 --> 01:14:37.725
- No!

1266
01:14:37.725 --> 01:14:40.283
I said not another step.

1267
01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.453
- Okay.

1268
01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.200
What do you want me to do?

1269
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.653
- Just back away.

1270
01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:50.843
- Okay.

1271
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.803
- Look. okay.

1272
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.870
I know this looks bad. but it's just...

1273
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:02.870
It's not what it seems like. okay?

1274
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:05.011
Just calm down and let me explain.

1275
01:15:05.011 --> 01:15:06.570
- Explain?

1276
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:08.062
Explain this.

1277
01:15:08.062 --> 01:15:10.433
(dramatic music)

1278
01:15:10.433 --> 01:15:11.320
- What is that?

1279
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.153
- What is that?

1280
01:15:12.153 --> 01:15:13.933
You know exactly what this is. Mark.

1281
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:16.683
This is Heather Beech's necklace.

1282
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.960
- Where'd you get that?

1283
01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.280
- I found it at your house.

1284
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.253
Either you're just
clumsy or really unlucky.

1285
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.950
- You are not seeing the opportunity

1286
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:32.070
that is in front of you.

1287
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:34.030
There is so much you could learn here.

1288
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.500
so much that you could use for the movie.

1289
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.370
It's sincere. It's real. okay.

1290
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:38.610
It'll be authentic.

1291
01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:40.820
- Okay. yeah. Maybe I
should be thanking you.

1292
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.410
You know. I was starting to worry

1293
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:44.560
about the ending of our little flick.

1294
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.273
Never thought I'd be the
hero of my own movie.

1295
01:15:47.273 --> 01:15:49.273
Yet here you come with a little twist.

1296
01:15:50.528 --> 01:15:52.460
I wonder who they'd get to play me.

1297
01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:54.250
- Okay. I know it looks like

1298
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.970
you don't have any choices here.

1299
01:15:55.970 --> 01:16:00.170
It's an odd situation. but you
just need to take a second.

1300
01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:01.910
You don't have to do this. okay?

1301
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:03.760
You don't have to do
this. Just take a second.

1302
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.593
(Holly grunts)
(slam)

1303
01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:05.826
(dramatic music)

1304
01:16:05.826 --> 01:16:08.826
(breathing heavily)

1305
01:16:10.443 --> 01:16:12.380
(tool clanking)

1306
01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.490
Holly?

1307
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:15.040
- He was pointing a gun at you.

1308
01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.960
He was pointing a gun at
you. so I had to hit him.

1309
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.253
Oh my God! Is he okay?

1310
01:16:21.824 --> 01:16:23.380
- He's not breathing.

1311
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.540
- Oh my God! I can't...

1312
01:16:25.532 --> 01:16:26.990
Oh my God.

1313
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:28.720
Oh my God. but he had...

1314
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.810
He had that necklace
he kept talking about!

1315
01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:33.520
It was Seth the whole time?

1316
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.413
He was trying to get us
to make a movie about him!

1317
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.550
Where's my phone?

1318
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:40.730
I need a phone! I need a phone!

1319
01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.990
We need to call the police!
We need to call the police!

1320
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.120
I just killed someone.

1321
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.460
We need to do something. I killed someone.

1322
01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.140
I just killed someone!

1323
01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.134
We have to do something!

1324
01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:52.400
- Hey. hey. hey. hey.
- No. no. no. no. no!

1325
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.900
I just killed somebody!

1326
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.304
- Okay. okay.

1327
01:16:55.304 --> 01:16:56.137
- It's not okay!

1328
01:16:56.137 --> 01:16:57.090
- Yes. yes. yes. it's fine.

1329
01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:59.750
- I killed someone! You
don't know how that feels!

1330
01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.300
We need to call the police!

1331
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.210
I have to call my boyfriend!

1332
01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:04.897
We have to call someone!

1333
01:17:04.897 --> 01:17:06.900
(soft music)

1334
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:07.780
- What? You have to-

1335
01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.210
- I left right after you called me.

1336
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:10.970
He doesn't even know where I am right now!

1337
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:13.490
And we need to get the police
here! Maybe an ambulance!

1338
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:16.223
We need to do something. Mark! Oh my God!

1339
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:18.300
Can you just...

1340
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.750
Can you get a phone. please?

1341
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.790
Please. can you get help?

1342
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:23.623
- Yeah.

1343
01:17:24.744 --> 01:17:25.577
- Thank you.

1344
01:17:25.577 --> 01:17:27.004
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1345
01:17:27.004 --> 01:17:27.837
- I'll...

1346
01:17:27.837 --> 01:17:29.710
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1347
01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:30.543
- I'll get the car.

1348
01:17:30.543 --> 01:17:33.014
I'll get the car and bring
the car around. okay?

1349
01:17:33.014 --> 01:17:34.251
- Okay.

1350
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:35.357
(crying)

1351
01:17:35.357 --> 01:17:37.963
And I'm gonna check. and maybe he's okay.

1352
01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:40.293
It was a mistake.

1353
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:43.053
Oh my God. Oh my God. Seth.

1354
01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:45.213
Okay.

1355
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.433
Mark?

1356
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:51.084
Where are we?

1357
01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:52.360
(dramatic music)

1358
01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.410
- How did I get here?

1359
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.170
- It doesn't matter. it doesn't
matter. it doesn't matter.

1360
01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:57.003
Just...

1361
01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.070
Mark's getting a phone.

1362
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.490
Oh my God. Can you hurry?

1363
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.693
