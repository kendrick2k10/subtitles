00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.406
MARSHAL McKOSKY: So. that's it.
huh?

4
00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:00.408
You just gonna leave us.

5
00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:02.236
Orders are
orders.

6
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.586
Your orders were to
protect that bank.

7
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.327
Stop Yule Bronson
and his men

8
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:07.589
and protect this town.

9
00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.420
Orders got changed.

10
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.034
Once night falls...

11
00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:19.688
you know they're gonna
descend on us

12
00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.603
like the plague.

13
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.564
Come with us
then. Marshal.

14
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.223
Got a nice. cushy seat
with your name on it.

15
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.791
Nothin' cowardly about living.

16
00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:39.273
Isn't that right. Judge?

17
00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:45.148
You can lead a horse to water

18
00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:47.759
bunch of fools.

19
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.022
Saddle up. boys!
Inexcusable.

20
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:51.154
Saddle up.

21
00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:16.527
Almost there.

22
00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:26.798
Ah!

23
00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:29.192
It's starting!

24
00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:33.283
That is enough!

25
00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:39.811
Marshal...

26
00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:46.078
Oh Marshal McKosky...

27
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.432
Hey. McKosky.

28
00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:52.911
Over here!

29
00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:55.740
MARSHAL McKOSKY: Bunch of
cowards.

30
00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:57.786
Show yourselves!

31
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.188
Well. that's awfully brave
of ya. Marshal.

32
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:10.712
especially for a man
without an army.

33
00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:18.372
I hope you burn in everlasting
fire. Yule Bronson.

34
00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:19.503
Oh...

35
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.288
that's harsh. Marshal.

36
00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:23.420
And here I am wanting you
just to stop breathin'.

37
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.862
Come on boys.

38
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.474
Let's go get that gold.

39
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.349
Not one more step.
Yule Bronson.

40
00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:41.221
Judge.

41
00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:43.875
Since when did you turn in
the gavel for the trigger?

42
00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.790
Gavels or triggers...

43
00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:47.575
justice is justice.

44
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:50.491
How men do you want to spend
to keep me

45
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:51.709
out of that vault?

46
00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:53.972
As many as it takes.

47
00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:56.671
That's quite a high price.

48
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.934
Nobody said anything
about cheap.

49
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.809
What about you. Judge?

50
00:04:04.983 --> 00:04:07.769
What's your life worth to ya?
All that gold?

51
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.772
I think you're one barrel
too few.

52
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:22.566
Oh. it'll be you.

53
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:25.395
Trial later or trigger today.

54
00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.139
Well. that gold right there...

55
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.141
that's my purpose.

56
00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:36.667
Killin' you...

57
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.366
and you...

58
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.150
and you...

59
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.544
that's my plan.

60
00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.981
And we're prepared to die
for what's right.

61
00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:01.170
All right. relax.

62
00:05:01.388 --> 00:05:03.172
They won't shoot me
in the back.

63
00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:06.044
That's why they'll lose.

64
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:08.525
Ma'am.

65
00:05:49.914 --> 00:05:51.263
Don't smell right.

66
00:05:57.748 --> 00:05:59.533
It's the lack
of trees.

67
00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:03.711
Yeah.

68
00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:14.678
Buge...

69
00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:16.288
we got company.

70
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:18.987
I see 'em.

71
00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:35.960
Sheriff John Breaker?

72
00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:37.527
It's "marshal" now.

73
00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:39.442
Well. you're a long way
from Missouri.

74
00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:41.139
Yep.

75
00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:43.533
A long way. just to deliver
a murderin' fiend

76
00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.666
like that one you got there.

77
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:48.973
You the town marshal?

78
00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:51.367
The marshal sent me.

79
00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.238
Told me to take this

80
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.545
burdensome prisoner
off your back.

81
00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:56.851
So you can head on back home.

82
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:58.940
I expected the marshal.

83
00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:05.642
You were expecting the marshal.

84
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.517
Well. it gets busy out here
for the tin stars.

85
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:13.389
With the Comanche.
the Apache.

86
00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:16.914
the banditos to boot.

87
00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:22.485
I expected the marshal.

88
00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:24.792
And I expected to witness
a legend.

89
00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:30.537
But you'll get used to
disappointments out here.

90
00:07:31.842 --> 00:07:33.627
Thought I'd be taller.did ya?

91
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:34.845
Nah.

92
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:36.760
Younger.

93
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.283
Well you see.
that's the problem

94
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.982
with always bein'
the last man standing.

95
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:44.464
you get old.

96
00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:04.701
Hyah!

97
00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:18.846
You're plugged.

98
00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:22.589
They nicked me.

99
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.684
Welcome to the West. marshal.

100
00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:39.475
These men are dead
because of you. Why?

101
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:42.304
These men are dead because
they came after me.

102
00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:44.524
Glad you're on my side.

103
00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:45.655
John.

104
00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:47.352
How many more like this?

105
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.180
How much further we
gotta go?

106
00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:52.575
John.

107
00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:06.502
You waitin' here
for the marshal?

108
00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:08.199
Can't afford to wait.

109
00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:09.853
Not if we want to get home.

110
00:09:30.178 --> 00:09:31.919
Here we go.

111
00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:44.584
Sir?

112
00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:47.108
What?

113
00:09:47.282 --> 00:09:50.067
I'm looking for
Marshal McKosky.

114
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:52.461
Well. he's indisposed.

115
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.463
What do you want?

116
00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:57.205
He put out a warrant
for Henry Bronson.

117
00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.076
Aka Deadeye.

118
00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:00.338
And uh...

119
00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:03.124
I have his man right here.

120
00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:05.126
You brought in Henry Bronson?

121
00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:06.562
Yes. sir.

122
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.911
And who are you?

123
00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:09.783
Marshal John Breaker.

124
00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:13.090
Breaker?

125
00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.790
The John Breaker?

126
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.794
If I get that battle right.
I think I was...

127
00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:22.796
just over that ridge.

128
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.275
Yeah.

129
00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:26.800
Yes. you were.
I remember.

130
00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:30.194
Sergeant Major John Breaker...

131
00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:34.372
stands alone against
the grey tide.

132
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:36.940
Well...
hardly alone.

133
00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:38.550
Buge!

134
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:42.598
This is Deputy Marshal
Bugle Bearclaw.

135
00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:45.514
He was on the ridge beside me
the whole time.

136
00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:49.170
Henry Deadeye Bronson.

137
00:10:49.344 --> 00:10:51.651
You're even uglier
than your poster.

138
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.828
Lock him up
for me.

139
00:10:58.309 --> 00:11:00.834
I'll take him from here.
Marshal.

140
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:04.272
You've come too many miles
to worry about the last inch.

141
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.189
Sir?
When's the next train?

142
00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:10.452
Oh. about an hour.

143
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.410
See the quartermaster.

144
00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:14.586
And you can get your deputy
patched up by the doc too

145
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.763
while you're at it.

146
00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.547
To the famous John Breaker.

147
00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:25.423
I guess it's not too healthy
in your line of work...

148
00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:27.034
bein' famous.

149
00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:28.992
I don't think it's healthy
period.

150
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:32.387
Well. at least in the army.
the more famous you become.

151
00:11:32.604 --> 00:11:34.737
the farther you get
from the front.

152
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:37.958
But you lawmen...

153
00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:41.831
they keep pushin' you deeper and
deeper into the troubles.

154
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.530
Sir. what's gonna happen
with Deadeye?

155
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.054
Oh...

156
00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:49.447
we have ways of dealin'
with the likes of him.

157
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.145
With all due respect
sir. he gets

158
00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:54.148
a civilian trial.
not a military court martial.

159
00:11:54.322 --> 00:11:57.499
Well. the county judge
is in the same mess

160
00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.937
as the marshal is. down there
in Absolem's Hill.

161
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:04.071
And I don't expect to see
them any time soon.

162
00:12:04.288 --> 00:12:05.855
And we are pullin' out.

163
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:07.422
headin' north up to the
badlands.

164
00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:08.858
The trouble up there...

165
00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:11.774
trumps trouble down here.

166
00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:13.341
But don't worry.

167
00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:15.560
Your man's gonna get
what's comin' to him.

168
00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:20.652
Well. we had plenty of hangin'
trees in Missouri.

169
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.831
Trials are a luxury.

170
00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:27.181
It's not a luxury.

171
00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:28.922
It's the law.

172
00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:34.971
I have been fighting for this
Union my whole life...

173
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.626
I am not gonna compromise
the Constitution

174
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.934
over your bottom of the barrel
prisoner.

175
00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:44.459
Thank you. sir.

176
00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:46.243
And uh...

177
00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:50.508
You travel safe now.

178
00:12:50.726 --> 00:12:51.945
Marshal.

179
00:12:58.081 --> 00:12:58.908
Yeah.

180
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.333
Is this the moment where I'm
supposed to ask you

181
00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:34.161
if you're okay?

182
00:13:34.378 --> 00:13:37.164
No wonder you were
never married. Buge.

183
00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:39.296
Who says I was never married?

184
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:42.734
What?

185
00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:44.084
You never asked.

186
00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:45.476
Ah!

187
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.087
Well... old flames

188
00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:49.437
are hardly our topic
of choice now are they?

189
00:13:49.611 --> 00:13:51.265
What are you talkin' about?

190
00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:53.876
I've heard more stories about
you courtin' Bonnie

191
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.226
than there are legs on a
centipede.

192
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.011
Oh. you can hardly call Bonnie
an old flame.

193
00:13:58.185 --> 00:13:59.751
She's my wife.

194
00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:01.405
You know. you could've offered
up a few stories

195
00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:03.712
yourself along the way;
it's called conversation.

196
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.453
You should've asked!
Well. you never asked

197
00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:06.671
about me and Bonnie. did ya?

198
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:07.890
Oh. so what does that tell ya?

199
00:14:08.108 --> 00:14:10.197
Ow!

200
00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.993
You're loadin' bullets.

201
00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:26.561
But you're countin' bodies.

202
00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:29.869
It's hard to swallow
killin' a man.

203
00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:33.698
Especially when it's for the
likes of someone like Deadeye.

204
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:36.179
That's always been
the job. John.

205
00:14:36.353 --> 00:14:38.051
Our job.

206
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:41.097
Our whole lives have been

207
00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:42.838
pockmarked with
shallow graves. Buge.

208
00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:44.666
And for what?

209
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.407
It's never been easy.

210
00:14:46.581 --> 00:14:48.148
No.

211
00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:50.672
But hard's easy when
you know what's right.

212
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.804
What's not right?

213
00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:55.198
We delivered the warrant.

214
00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:56.591
That was our job.

215
00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.419
Did we?

216
00:14:58.593 --> 00:15:01.204
You don't trust
the Colonel. That's it.

217
00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:02.902
I think we should head
down to Absolem's Hill

218
00:15:03.032 --> 00:15:05.948
ourselves and deliver Deadeye
that last inch.

219
00:15:06.122 --> 00:15:07.689
Absolem's Hill?

220
00:15:07.863 --> 00:15:09.125
More like Hell's Hill.

221
00:15:09.256 --> 00:15:10.866
Doc!
Almost done.

222
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.694
You said you went down
to Absolem's Hill?

223
00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:15.088
I pulled more lead out of more
men comin' from that town

224
00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:18.004
than I had in all of Vicksburg.

225
00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:19.527
How do you think I got this?

226
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:20.832
What's the ruckus?

227
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:22.704
Can't fight what you can't see.

228
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.053
Night fighters.

229
00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:25.663
Shadow shooters.

230
00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:27.317
Murderin' reavers.
And you boys

231
00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:29.450
are just
gonna leave 'em like that?

232
00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:31.974
Well you got...

233
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:35.847
raids on the innocent settlers
in the Badlands...

234
00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:38.415
or a town with the most stubborn
old judge

235
00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:39.808
you're ever gonna meet.

236
00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.592
Stubborn?

237
00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:43.943
He makes a mule seem like
a mercy.

238
00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:51.211
You know. they say he's the last
man standing down there.

239
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:53.561
Yeah. he and his daughter.

240
00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:56.564
It can't be him.

241
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:59.088
What's his name?

242
00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:00.611
I don't know.

243
00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:02.570
He's got a scar.

244
00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.095
It's him.

245
00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:07.096
Who?

246
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.489
How would you know?

247
00:16:11.405 --> 00:16:12.841
I gave him that scar.

248
00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:16.453
John.

249
00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:17.846
John!

250
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:20.501
John!

251
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:21.763
Get the horses!

252
00:16:21.937 --> 00:16:22.894
We don't have any!

253
00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:25.201
Find three!

254
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:26.855
Three?

255
00:16:32.904 --> 00:16:34.645
Ready your rifles.

256
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.735
Wait!

257
00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:38.954
Aim.

258
00:16:39.172 --> 00:16:41.087
I said. Wait!

259
00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:44.351
We can't take him with us and we
can't leave him here.

260
00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:46.135
Fine. I'll take him
with me.

261
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:48.137
What are you talkin' about?

262
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:50.096
I'm heading to Absolem's Hill;
I'll take Deadeye with me.

263
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.488
That's impossible.

264
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:53.142
It's idiotic. It's suicide!

265
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.276
My job is to deliver that
prisoner to Marshal McKosky.

266
00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:58.147
McKosky has got
way bigger problems

267
00:16:58.365 --> 00:16:59.496
than your bottom feeder.

268
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.411
I know the judge.
I can talk to him.

269
00:17:01.585 --> 00:17:03.152
Maybe I'll get him
out of there.

270
00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:04.632
Ha!

271
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.416
Good luck with that.

272
00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:08.723
Ready your rifles.

273
00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:10.638
You order that fire.
and I'll have you

274
00:17:10.812 --> 00:17:14.468
court martialed so fast
it'll make your head spin.

275
00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:16.339
Deadeye is my jurisdiction.

276
00:17:16.513 --> 00:17:18.211
Court martial?

277
00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:19.995
You don't have the clout.

278
00:17:20.169 --> 00:17:21.910
Oh. you forgot.

279
00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:23.390
I'm famous.

280
00:17:29.787 --> 00:17:30.745
At ease.

281
00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:38.361
You got to be kidding me.

282
00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:40.233
John!
It's the only way.

283
00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:42.670
The only wayto what?

284
00:17:42.844 --> 00:17:44.367
To do what's right.

285
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.850
There goes home.

286
00:17:50.591 --> 00:17:52.375
Eh. so what's
the plan. Marshal?

287
00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:55.683
Over which new horizon
lies justice for me?

288
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.250
Absolem's Hill.

289
00:18:00.818 --> 00:18:03.343
I'd rather be buried
back there with them.

290
00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:05.562
Well. that can be arranged.

291
00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:08.217
Now. there are a few rules
I travel by.

292
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:09.436
I- I know the rules.

293
00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:10.698
I talk. you gag.

294
00:18:10.872 --> 00:18:11.655
I run. you shoot.

295
00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:13.048
I snore. you shoot.

296
00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:15.137
Nope.
That's Bugle's rule.

297
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:18.445
You snore. I shoot but I might
shoot you anyway.

298
00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:20.403
Let's get going if
we're gonna go.

299
00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:21.839
Come on.

300
00:18:22.057 --> 00:18:23.928
Hyah.

301
00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:43.122
Buge. you think it's time
for a little music?

302
00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:47.256
♪ In the cavern.
in the canyon ♪

303
00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:50.129
♪ Excavatin' for a mine ♪

304
00:18:50.303 --> 00:18:53.262
♪ Dwelt a miner.
forty-niner ♪

305
00:18:53.393 --> 00:18:54.959
Can you just shoot
me now?

306
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.526
Death would be the easy
way out.

307
00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:58.137
All together.

308
00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:02.358
♪ Oh my darlin'.
oh my darlin' ♪

309
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.862
Aww...

310
00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:36.000
Judge.
Hmm.

311
00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.612
-Been a while.
-Hmm.

312
00:19:40.135 --> 00:19:42.181
Sounds like Charlotte's still
with him.

313
00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.316
What?

314
00:19:47.447 --> 00:19:49.710
Hmm...

315
00:19:49.884 --> 00:19:52.539
You two were awfully close
once upon a time.

316
00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:54.628
When was the last time
you heard from him?

317
00:19:54.802 --> 00:19:57.326
Probably not since
Charlotte's husband died.

318
00:19:57.457 --> 00:19:59.546
Charlotte's husband died?
Hmm.

319
00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:04.855
Ah. good night. Buge.

320
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:11.949
Ol' Deadeye's breakin' the
rules.
Shut up.

321
00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.474
Are you seriously
tryin' to escape?

322
00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:15.910
You-
you're gonna...

323
00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:16.693
What?

324
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:18.913
Hand it over!

325
00:20:20.393 --> 00:20:22.699
You just gotta know.
you can't escape.

326
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.005
I ain't goin' back
to that town.

327
00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:25.267
Well. look at you.

328
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:27.051
You're hobbled from
head to toe.

329
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.183
Where are you gonna
go?

330
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:29.663
I'd rather die in the desert

331
00:20:29.793 --> 00:20:31.926
than ride back into that hell
hole.

332
00:20:32.143 --> 00:20:35.495
Give me the rest of that.
Come on.

333
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:36.757
What's that?

334
00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:38.237
Give me that too.
What's that?

335
00:20:38.411 --> 00:20:39.412
You ain't getting that.

336
00:20:39.586 --> 00:20:42.284
Give me the rifle. then.

337
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:43.677
All right.

338
00:20:43.807 --> 00:20:45.896
Here. I'll trade you the
canteen.

339
00:20:46.027 --> 00:20:47.594
You're all heart. kid.

340
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:49.248
Now. you come after me.

341
00:20:49.422 --> 00:20:51.380
better pray you don't find me.

342
00:20:51.554 --> 00:20:52.990
I spared your life.

343
00:20:53.164 --> 00:20:55.254
You better give me one hour
head start.

344
00:20:55.384 --> 00:20:57.212
Yeah.

345
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.866
How long you think
he'll last?

346
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.346
There go the horses.

347
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.956
Oh yeah.

348
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:04.219
What do now?

349
00:21:04.393 --> 00:21:06.003
Chase after the man.
obviously.

350
00:21:12.183 --> 00:21:14.621
It's been more than an
hour. John.

351
00:21:14.838 --> 00:21:16.797
Just a second. Buge.

352
00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.409
John...
Yep.

353
00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:21.845
What are you doin'?

354
00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:24.152
I've literally got
somethin' up my sleeve.

355
00:21:26.763 --> 00:21:28.635
Ready?
Uh...

356
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:30.767
Huh?

357
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:31.986
Surprise!

358
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.292
Huh? Huh?

359
00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:35.294
It was literally
up my sleeve.

360
00:21:35.468 --> 00:21:37.165
Yeah.

361
00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:39.776
That's the surprise?
Yeah.

362
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:42.518
Ah well...no. no.

363
00:21:42.692 --> 00:21:44.128
I get it. yeah.

364
00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:47.088
So. what's uh-
what's it gonna do?

365
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.307
Give him lead splinters?

366
00:21:48.437 --> 00:21:50.744
Lead-

367
00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:52.789
Bonnie gave it to me.

368
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.617
In case of emergency.

369
00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:56.793
Ah no...

370
00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:01.929
I suppose that qualifies.

371
00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:03.844
Qualified?

372
00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:09.676
I think it's great.

373
00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:30.174
John?

374
00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:12.303
Hey. your wife.

375
00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:14.001
What was her name?

376
00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:16.482
Which one?

377
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:18.571
Wh- wh- which one?

378
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:22.705
Kidding.

379
00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:24.664
Oh. you stink.

380
00:23:24.838 --> 00:23:27.362
Your face.

381
00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:29.364
You think you
know a man.

382
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:32.062
It was a long
time ago. John.

383
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.065
Before I even knew
what a bugle was.

384
00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:42.638
Her name...

385
00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.423
in English...

386
00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:46.686
Water Lily.

387
00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:50.429
Water Lily.

388
00:23:53.257 --> 00:23:55.129
I'm not the man
I used to be. John.

389
00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:57.740
I used to
be faster.

390
00:23:59.002 --> 00:24:00.613
More alert.

391
00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:03.616
Deadeye should never have
gotten the jump on me.

392
00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:07.402
Look...

393
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.752
None of us are the men
that we used to be.

394
00:24:10.927 --> 00:24:12.494
That can be a good
thing. too.

395
00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:13.887
I don't know what's
going to happen when

396
00:24:14.104 --> 00:24:15.671
we get into this town.

397
00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:17.717
But once we
deliver Deadeye...

398
00:24:20.023 --> 00:24:21.808
your job is done.

399
00:24:23.244 --> 00:24:24.898
Okay?

400
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:31.426
As long as your
job's not done...

401
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:34.560
neither is mine.

402
00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:23.696
Where is that dirtbag?

403
00:25:23.826 --> 00:25:25.219
Get up!

404
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.222
At least they let you
keep the eye patch.

405
00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:33.880
Still rather die
in the desert?

406
00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:35.708
Yeah. just get
me outta here.

407
00:25:37.144 --> 00:25:39.886
They rode me out here
and left me for dead.

408
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.368
Where'd they go?

409
00:25:45.456 --> 00:25:46.893
That way.

410
00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:48.459
How many?

411
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.939
Five. mounted.

412
00:25:50.157 --> 00:25:52.115
There was seven.

413
00:25:52.289 --> 00:25:54.727
But I filled two
of 'em with lead.

414
00:25:57.033 --> 00:25:58.818
Well. what are
we waitin' for?

415
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.081
My decision.

416
00:26:01.255 --> 00:26:02.778
- What decision?
-Whether I save you

417
00:26:02.952 --> 00:26:04.867
again. or is this
justice enough?

418
00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.217
Just cut me loose.

419
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:09.089
They may come back.

420
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:12.571
I buried two men
because of you.

421
00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.749
I don't know what you
did before me...

422
00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:19.360
but I know what I've done
on account of you.

423
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.799
I can't even find
the rightness in ya.

424
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.150
And now I'm having a hard
time finding it in me.

425
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:30.501
Yeah. well that's
'cause there ain't none.

426
00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:35.594
Go on. do it Marshal.

427
00:26:41.034 --> 00:26:42.470
What'd I say?

428
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:44.603
That's enough
outta you.

429
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:52.088
Get up.
let's get moving.

430
00:26:55.178 --> 00:26:57.224
None of this was on the way
to Absolem's Hill.

431
00:26:57.354 --> 00:26:59.269
Shh. shh...

432
00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:00.880
What are we
even doing?

433
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.143
- Guess.
- We're going after 'em?

434
00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:06.668
You took on seven and killed
two; they can't be that tough.

435
00:27:06.886 --> 00:27:10.237
Yeah...
I had guns and a horse.

436
00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:14.284
Well. now you have
the two of us.

437
00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:26.862
Hey. hey!
Surprise!

438
00:27:27.036 --> 00:27:27.907
Drop it.

439
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:29.735
U.S. Marshal.

440
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:31.737
Hey Buge...

441
00:27:31.954 --> 00:27:32.955
It worked.

442
00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:34.565
Hand over the rifle. son.

443
00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:40.615
Mornin' fellas.

444
00:27:43.487 --> 00:27:45.098
Whoa. whoa...

445
00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:47.274
U.S. Marshal.

446
00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:49.232
We're not here for you.

447
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:50.712
Just here for
our things.

448
00:27:50.843 --> 00:27:52.409
Hmm.

449
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:55.108
You'll have to excuse us.
Marshal. we're--

450
00:27:55.282 --> 00:27:56.326
little bit touchy.

451
00:27:56.544 --> 00:27:58.067
Lost good men last night.

452
00:27:58.241 --> 00:28:00.026
So I heard.

453
00:28:00.243 --> 00:28:02.419
Is this the man
who ambushed you?

454
00:28:03.507 --> 00:28:07.511
Well. when a man stumbles
across a rattlesnake

455
00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.209
was he ambushed?

456
00:28:09.383 --> 00:28:10.819
Nah...

457
00:28:10.993 --> 00:28:12.778
But you kill it before
it kills you.

458
00:28:12.952 --> 00:28:14.954
But you didn't kill him.

459
00:28:15.128 --> 00:28:17.826
You left him out to roast.

460
00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:19.959
Yule feels that death

461
00:28:20.089 --> 00:28:23.179
is a mercy. for
a man like that.

462
00:28:23.353 --> 00:28:24.920
Yule?

463
00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:26.226
That mercy's
gotta be earned

464
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.228
real slow.

465
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:34.103
He said he killed
two of you.

466
00:28:34.234 --> 00:28:35.583
Why do I see
three graves?

467
00:28:36.497 --> 00:28:39.718
Oh. I thought maybe I'd throw
you in one of them.

468
00:28:48.552 --> 00:28:50.076
Give 'em what's theirs.

469
00:29:15.057 --> 00:29:16.711
Hyah.

470
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:34.947
Oh look c'mon. he just
came up on me.

471
00:29:35.121 --> 00:29:36.862
just outta
nowhere.

472
00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:38.777
No...

473
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:41.083
Please have
mercy Mr. Watson.

474
00:29:41.214 --> 00:29:42.389
Oh...

475
00:29:42.563 --> 00:29:44.086
but I am.
No!!!

476
00:29:55.141 --> 00:29:56.751
Why do these men keep
trying to kill ya?

477
00:29:58.144 --> 00:29:59.798
My brother.

478
00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:01.408
Your brother?

479
00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:03.192
You mean.
there's two of ya?

480
00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:05.542
Good grief. that's all
the world needed.

481
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.545
Wait... you mean Yule's
your brother?

482
00:30:08.676 --> 00:30:11.026
You've heard of
Jacob and Esau?

483
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.073
Ha. more like Cain
and Abel to me.

484
00:30:14.203 --> 00:30:16.162
I reckon we better get
into town before nightfall

485
00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:17.685
or trouble's gonna find us.

486
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:19.905
Let's go. hyah.

487
00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:25.388
Hurry up. boys.

488
00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:27.651
They can't be too far ahead.

489
00:30:27.782 --> 00:30:30.524
I'll get the others;
meet at Absolem's Hill.

490
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:52.154
It's a ghost town.

491
00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:58.160
Your brother. huh?

492
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:02.730
Why does he
want you dead?

493
00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:06.125
Because I'm him.
and not him.

494
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.129
First. he's
a prisoner.

495
00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:11.826
Now he's a poet.

496
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.046
Explanations later.
right now. we survive.

497
00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:17.397
All right. I'll head up
the main street.

498
00:31:17.571 --> 00:31:20.356
You two go around the back.
and I'll meet you at that bank.

499
00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:21.923
Buge...

500
00:31:22.097 --> 00:31:24.056
I'll see you
on the other side.

501
00:31:27.537 --> 00:31:29.365
Hey. easy Bugle.

502
00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:31.237
That's Deputy Marshal.
to you.

503
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:02.529
Who are you?

504
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:07.186
Who are you?

505
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.883
State your business.

506
00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:11.755
U.S. Marshal.
John Breaker.

507
00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:14.062
Your son.

508
00:32:14.236 --> 00:32:15.150
John?

509
00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:16.369
Hello. father.

510
00:32:16.586 --> 00:32:18.066
John. it's you!

511
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.156
Oh. hello sis!

512
00:32:23.506 --> 00:32:25.769
John. I never
would've hoped-

513
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:27.946
Well. it's good
to see you. Char.

514
00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:38.086
Charlotte!

515
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.783
John. get inside.

516
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.960
There they are hyah!

517
00:32:43.439 --> 00:32:45.093
Get ready. boys!

518
00:32:52.448 --> 00:32:53.928
Bugle's out at the back.

519
00:32:56.148 --> 00:32:58.672
- Help me!
- Yeah.

520
00:33:00.282 --> 00:33:02.023
- John...
-Bugle's out back. dad.

521
00:33:02.154 --> 00:33:03.372
with a prisoner.

522
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:04.591
- Prisoner?
- C'mon.

523
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:06.158
What's going on?

524
00:33:06.332 --> 00:33:07.028
Chuck.
go to the door.

525
00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:08.987
I'll cover you.

526
00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:14.122
I'm going upstairs.

527
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.776
The old man. shoot him!

528
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.256
They're already there.

529
00:33:22.783 --> 00:33:24.480
They gotta be close.

530
00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.568
Bugle!

531
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:32.793
Char!

532
00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:34.447
Cover me!

533
00:33:34.577 --> 00:33:36.231
Bugle!

534
00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:05.608
C'mon. John!

535
00:34:12.528 --> 00:34:13.573
Go. go. go!

536
00:34:13.747 --> 00:34:15.053
Get in there!

537
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:18.621
Come!

538
00:34:20.884 --> 00:34:22.408
Almost there.

539
00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:34.855
It's Yule!

540
00:34:36.509 --> 00:34:37.423
No!!!

541
00:34:37.597 --> 00:34:39.077
No. don't-

542
00:34:43.211 --> 00:34:44.517
Let's regroup
at the livery!

543
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:46.258
- What happened?
- Yule!

544
00:34:46.388 --> 00:34:48.608
It's his brother;
it's not who you think it is.

545
00:34:48.782 --> 00:34:50.784
Thisis your
prisoner?

546
00:34:56.224 --> 00:34:58.226
Chuck. up front.

547
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:05.712
Hmph. watch out
front. old friend.

548
00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:08.236
Hmm?

549
00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:16.288
Not to say I'm ungrateful son.
but please consider my surprise

550
00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:18.246
when I ask...

551
00:35:18.464 --> 00:35:19.900
what are you doing here?

552
00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:21.075
And with him?

553
00:35:21.293 --> 00:35:22.555
Serving a warrant.

554
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:24.078
So you bring him here?

555
00:35:24.252 --> 00:35:26.124
To a Marshal McKosky.

556
00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:30.998
Henry...

557
00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:33.218
Henry Bronson?

558
00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:35.655
It's uncanny.
Well. you really...

559
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:37.178
put a snake in our barrel. John.

560
00:35:37.396 --> 00:35:38.614
We now have

561
00:35:38.788 --> 00:35:41.835
the twin of the
meanest. evilest

562
00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:43.053
most vile man-

563
00:35:43.184 --> 00:35:45.795
No. monster.
that I've ever met.

564
00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:47.449
Twin?

565
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.495
Oh. we're just
learning on the go.

566
00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:51.540
By the way. good to
see you again. Buge.

567
00:35:51.671 --> 00:35:53.325
It's good to see
you. Judge.

568
00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:55.065
Buge. you remember Char.

569
00:35:55.283 --> 00:35:57.024
of course.

570
00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:00.549
- Hello. Charlotte.
- Hey. Buge.

571
00:36:00.723 --> 00:36:02.812
Never in a million

572
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.468
bets would I have bet on
the idea that you'd ride up

573
00:36:06.642 --> 00:36:08.775
into all of this.

574
00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:10.298
Likewise. dad.

575
00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:15.347
Likewise.

576
00:36:16.391 --> 00:36:18.350
Food's ready.
come and get it.

577
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.224
-Eat.
- Oh. I could bite

578
00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:25.357
the head off a turkey
vulture. I'm so hungry.

579
00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:29.622
So that's what
everyone's dying over?

580
00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:35.541
My brother didn't give
a penny about the gold.

581
00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:37.195
At this point

582
00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:39.066
he just wants to make
that judge pay.

583
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:41.199
Pay.
pay for what?

584
00:36:42.678 --> 00:36:44.724
For standin' in his
way. of course.

585
00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:47.553
Huh.

586
00:36:48.771 --> 00:36:50.425
Yeah. my dad dealt with...

587
00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:52.558
every type of outlaw.

588
00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:56.039
But he always talked about
their misfortunes and their...

589
00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:59.086
humanity despite their sins.
but your brother...

590
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.698
He calls him. a monster.

591
00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:08.226
A monster. huh?

592
00:37:10.489 --> 00:37:12.404
He'd take that
as a compliment.

593
00:37:13.927 --> 00:37:15.581
Wanted to kill
this town.

594
00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:17.322
Then. the county.

595
00:37:17.452 --> 00:37:19.106
Burn down the whole state.

596
00:37:24.938 --> 00:37:27.419
He wanted people to fear
his name across the nation.

597
00:37:27.593 --> 00:37:29.029
He wanted your grandkid's

598
00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:31.771
grandkids to remember
his name.

599
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.383
Monster...

600
00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.517
Yeah.

601
00:37:38.691 --> 00:37:40.475
Why are you
two at odds?

602
00:37:40.606 --> 00:37:43.609
I'm just small time.
my ambition extends from

603
00:37:43.783 --> 00:37:46.089
my hand to my mouth. my pocket
to my glass of whiskey.

604
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.396
What would I want
with a dead town?

605
00:37:49.615 --> 00:37:51.181
As soon as I was out of his

606
00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:53.445
sight he started
murdering people in myname.

607
00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:55.708
Blamin' it on me.

608
00:37:55.882 --> 00:37:57.666
I couldn't go 100 miles
without seeing 100 wanted

609
00:37:57.797 --> 00:37:59.538
posters. "Wanted Dead or Alive."

610
00:37:59.712 --> 00:38:01.104
So the warrant
that I served

611
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.019
should've been for your
brother. not you.

612
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:05.370
The whole thing
fell apart when ah-

613
00:38:05.544 --> 00:38:08.024
some drunk in St. Louis
forked me in the eye. but-

614
00:38:08.198 --> 00:38:09.983
Why didn't he just shoot you
when you were in the desert?

615
00:38:10.157 --> 00:38:12.551
Hey. well...

616
00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:14.553
for Yule...

617
00:38:14.727 --> 00:38:16.424
dead is dead.

618
00:38:16.555 --> 00:38:17.817
It's mercy.

619
00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:19.688
The torment is over.

620
00:38:19.862 --> 00:38:22.474
If you can string someone
along to the brink...

621
00:38:22.604 --> 00:38:24.389
Yeah...

622
00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:26.826
Now. that's the game;
at least the one he plays.

623
00:38:29.785 --> 00:38:31.352
If you

624
00:38:31.483 --> 00:38:33.093
claim to be the man
that you are. innocent.

625
00:38:33.223 --> 00:38:35.748
Well. I didn't say
I was innocent.

626
00:38:35.922 --> 00:38:37.489
I said I'm
not my brother.

627
00:38:37.663 --> 00:38:38.620
So then.
why don't you just

628
00:38:38.794 --> 00:38:40.318
level with the law?

629
00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:42.102
Level with the law.

630
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.930
Level with the law.

631
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:46.846
Level with the law.

632
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.064
Tell me you did it
to yourself

633
00:38:48.282 --> 00:38:49.718
and I'll be impressed.

634
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:51.459
Yeah. I done wrong.

635
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.765
Hmph.

636
00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:54.680
But the greatest crime
I committed

637
00:38:54.854 --> 00:38:56.769
was just lookin'
like my brother.

638
00:38:58.074 --> 00:38:59.772
Follow me.

639
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.037
Look for any weakness. boys.

640
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:10.260
Keep me safe.
Marshal.

641
00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:12.045
The vault is
the safest place.

642
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.528
Nowhere's safe.

643
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:21.228
I think the best plan
of escape is to leave at

644
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.622
the dark hour just before dawn.
Hmm.

645
00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:25.972
That's smart. son. less
trouble to be had then.

646
00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:27.800
Do you have any horses?

647
00:39:28.017 --> 00:39:29.715
No. not anymore.

648
00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:31.064
Ours ran away.

649
00:39:31.238 --> 00:39:33.066
Bugle hid theirs.
that leaves us two.

650
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.850
Why don't you and
Charlotte take them?

651
00:39:35.068 --> 00:39:36.852
As soon as we clear this
place out you can get some help.

652
00:39:36.983 --> 00:39:39.028
- John...
- What do we do with him?

653
00:39:40.769 --> 00:39:42.554
What about him?

654
00:39:42.728 --> 00:39:44.425
Well. you knew who he was.
Him and his brother

655
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:47.036
came over the border
half a year back.

656
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.562
What I gather. they came over
together but quickly grew apart.

657
00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:53.173
His brother wants
him dead.

658
00:39:53.347 --> 00:39:56.306
Hmm. they're the opposite
sides of the same evil.

659
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:59.135
They attract bad
but repel each other.

660
00:39:59.266 --> 00:40:02.051
I suppose family's tricky
enough without being a

661
00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:04.750
pack of murderers.
He's a burden.

662
00:40:05.968 --> 00:40:07.317
No. he's an asset.

663
00:40:07.492 --> 00:40:09.102
Or could be against
his brother.

664
00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.930
That's up to Marshal
Mckosky to decide.

665
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.801
Where is he?

666
00:40:12.975 --> 00:40:14.586
He's dead.

667
00:40:18.633 --> 00:40:20.113
You know. John.
I gotta stay.

668
00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:21.201
- Father.
-No. you leave your

669
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:22.550
prisoner with me.

670
00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:23.508
You did right
to bring him here.

671
00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:24.770
We all go together.

672
00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:26.162
that's final.
I'm sorry. no.

673
00:40:26.293 --> 00:40:27.033
- Father!
- Father...

674
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.338
Father. father.

675
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:29.688
Son. how many times do I gotta

676
00:40:29.818 --> 00:40:31.951
tell ya to call me pa or pops?

677
00:40:32.168 --> 00:40:34.649
If you're feeling especially
tender...

678
00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:35.607
daddy.

679
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.613
No... just call me Judge.

680
00:40:41.787 --> 00:40:42.962
Anything but "father."

681
00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:45.138
I'm not as Old Testament
as all that.

682
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:48.358
What is this fight
all about. for what?

683
00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:50.404
The vault?
The vault?

684
00:40:50.622 --> 00:40:52.667
Is it worth dying over?

685
00:40:52.885 --> 00:40:55.017
For you. your daughter.
my sister?

686
00:40:55.148 --> 00:40:57.193
Yule wants
the vault!

687
00:40:57.367 --> 00:41:00.240
We. your sister and I.
are fighting

688
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.894
for this town.

689
00:41:02.068 --> 00:41:03.809
What it stands for.

690
00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:05.375
What losing it would mean.

691
00:41:05.506 --> 00:41:07.247
It's a bunch
of buildings.

692
00:41:08.901 --> 00:41:10.598
John...

693
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.645
War is a real
estate business.

694
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.779
You of all people. know that.
Dad...

695
00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:20.652
How many times have
you risked your life for a hill?

696
00:41:20.782 --> 00:41:22.044
Won it?

697
00:41:22.262 --> 00:41:24.656
Then marched away
the next day. huh?

698
00:41:26.222 --> 00:41:27.920
The hill isn't
the point.

699
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.489
The point is showing
the enemy

700
00:41:31.706 --> 00:41:34.100
that they can't
always win.

701
00:41:37.016 --> 00:41:39.322
This bank is my hill.

702
00:41:40.236 --> 00:41:41.542
Oh. this is about
principle.

703
00:41:41.716 --> 00:41:42.630
No!

704
00:41:42.848 --> 00:41:43.805
It's about what's right.

705
00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:45.938
No. it's
a lost cause.

706
00:41:47.113 --> 00:41:48.462
Son...

707
00:41:48.636 --> 00:41:50.812
that gold in there is
meant for farming.

708
00:41:50.986 --> 00:41:53.075
for churches. for families.

709
00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:55.164
for life!

710
00:42:01.388 --> 00:42:04.565
There's a monster out there
that has

711
00:42:04.783 --> 00:42:08.090
killed or driven off every
God-created creature

712
00:42:08.264 --> 00:42:09.962
in this man-forsaken town.

713
00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:13.356
I mean. the army is gone.
the marshal is dead.

714
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.837
And I will not
amputate this place

715
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:17.578
from the land of the living.

716
00:42:17.709 --> 00:42:20.059
I will not leave it
to a pack of murderers.

717
00:42:24.716 --> 00:42:26.761
Well you. and
Charlotte and...

718
00:42:27.457 --> 00:42:29.982
Chuck.
Chuck Leftfoot.

719
00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:32.419
On account of my limp
on my left foot.

720
00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:35.161
And Mr. Leftfoot...

721
00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:38.468
You can't stop what's coming;
you know that.

722
00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:40.558
You're barely
in their way.

723
00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:44.518
Barely's better
than nothing.

724
00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:00.882
I'm sorry to hear
about your husband.

725
00:43:01.056 --> 00:43:02.580
It's been a while
back now.

726
00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:05.583
Years ago.

727
00:43:07.149 --> 00:43:09.369
It's hard to lose
someone you love.

728
00:43:11.327 --> 00:43:13.155
It's losing a part
of yourself.

729
00:43:14.461 --> 00:43:16.637
I will not leave if we all
go together. that's final.

730
00:43:16.811 --> 00:43:18.204
How stubborn
can you be?

731
00:43:18.334 --> 00:43:19.597
Look in the mirror. dad.

732
00:43:19.771 --> 00:43:21.250
Brother. rock
and father. hard place.

733
00:43:21.381 --> 00:43:22.817
They held out longer
than I expected.

734
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:24.689
I thought you of all

735
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:26.821
people would understand
what I am trying to do here.

736
00:43:26.995 --> 00:43:29.084
No. me of all people know
that the cost of a human

737
00:43:29.215 --> 00:43:31.130
life buys you nothing.

738
00:43:32.174 --> 00:43:34.437
Since when has my son
considered righteousness

739
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.701
a price too high?
Righteousness?

740
00:43:36.918 --> 00:43:39.529
All I see is stubbornness
from a stubborn old Judge.

741
00:43:39.704 --> 00:43:41.227
And where are all
the men in this town?

742
00:43:41.401 --> 00:43:43.664
I bet the banker will be
really glad to hear that you

743
00:43:43.882 --> 00:43:45.579
were willing to die
in his stead.

744
00:43:45.753 --> 00:43:47.537
I'm the banker.

745
00:43:47.668 --> 00:43:49.583
And if you think we don't
know the price of a human life

746
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:51.063
we know it all too well.

747
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:52.368
Everything that's left of
my customers

748
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:53.935
is out that window.

749
00:43:54.066 --> 00:43:56.285
Six feet under
in a pine box.

750
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:06.905
I. Uh...

751
00:44:07.035 --> 00:44:09.603
I bought this off
a woman making

752
00:44:09.734 --> 00:44:11.997
wood carvings at
the train station.

753
00:44:13.738 --> 00:44:15.957
It's a gift...

754
00:44:16.175 --> 00:44:17.829
for my grandchild.

755
00:44:20.701 --> 00:44:22.485
I'm...

756
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.358
I'm a great grandfather?

757
00:44:26.315 --> 00:44:27.926
So. here's my question:

758
00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:32.017
Would you rather
her know the man or

759
00:44:32.147 --> 00:44:33.714
know the legend?

760
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:37.500
It-- It's a her?

761
00:44:37.718 --> 00:44:39.067
I mean a-- a little girl?

762
00:44:39.285 --> 00:44:40.982
Well that's what Bonnie
thinks. so we'll find out

763
00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:43.376
when I get back.
Oh.

764
00:44:50.775 --> 00:44:53.473
I would want my great
granddaughter to know...

765
00:44:56.084 --> 00:45:00.175
that the price for doing what's
right is never too high.

766
00:45:02.874 --> 00:45:04.571
Yee-Hoo!

767
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:05.659
They're comin' back.

768
00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:07.705
Marshal John Breaker.

769
00:45:14.624 --> 00:45:16.235
Where you goin'?

770
00:45:16.365 --> 00:45:18.063
To count the cost.

771
00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.074
Bugle. when I say
run. run.

772
00:45:29.204 --> 00:45:30.075
Yule Bronson!

773
00:45:30.249 --> 00:45:32.033
I want to talk!

774
00:45:34.819 --> 00:45:36.298
John.
you should know-

775
00:45:36.472 --> 00:45:38.039
I know. you're in love
with Charlotte again.

776
00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:39.693
How did you know?

777
00:45:39.867 --> 00:45:41.260
Heck of a time for
this conversation Buge-

778
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.131
I just didn't want you
complaining later about

779
00:45:43.305 --> 00:45:45.090
not getting a confer.
Consider it conferred.

780
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.656
It's just that I never
thought I'd see her again.

781
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:47.788
Well. you may not
unless you're focused.

782
00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:49.442
Let's go.

783
00:45:52.227 --> 00:45:54.708
It true what they
say about 'im?

784
00:45:54.882 --> 00:45:56.536
'Bout to find out.

785
00:45:58.494 --> 00:46:00.453
Just be ready.

786
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.158
I told the boss
you're a stubborn man.

787
00:46:10.289 --> 00:46:12.247
Didn't I. fellas?

788
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:14.772
Like father. like son.
I suppose.

789
00:46:16.817 --> 00:46:19.385
Don't think I didn't
see him up there.

790
00:46:19.559 --> 00:46:21.561
Well. I was hoping to have
a little talk with your boss.

791
00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:23.650
But I guess he's
too big of a

792
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.391
coward!

793
00:46:25.608 --> 00:46:26.958
Sends his peons

794
00:46:27.175 --> 00:46:28.611
to parley.

795
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:32.615
Parley?

796
00:46:34.574 --> 00:46:37.055
He knows you're just a lot
of bark. bark. bark

797
00:46:37.229 --> 00:46:38.534
from a corner dog.

798
00:46:38.752 --> 00:46:40.972
- Did he just call us a dog?
- Yep.

799
00:46:41.102 --> 00:46:43.061
You're not the first
law man to

800
00:46:43.278 --> 00:46:44.976
make demands.

801
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.065
I won't have
any demands.

802
00:46:47.239 --> 00:46:49.154
Just a question.

803
00:46:50.416 --> 00:46:53.419
If I get the old man to walk
away. will you let us

804
00:46:53.636 --> 00:46:55.900
pass peacefully?

805
00:46:56.117 --> 00:46:57.684
And leave the gold?

806
00:46:57.858 --> 00:46:59.294
You can keep the rocks.

807
00:46:59.425 --> 00:47:01.906
Just no more death.

808
00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:05.518
The thing is I'll be
willing to oblige.

809
00:47:06.693 --> 00:47:08.303
The boys and I...

810
00:47:09.565 --> 00:47:12.525
well. we get excited
about all that gold.

811
00:47:15.484 --> 00:47:16.964
But Yule...

812
00:47:17.182 --> 00:47:19.793
He gets excited about...

813
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:22.448
killing your daddy.

814
00:47:22.665 --> 00:47:23.884
And your sister.

815
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:28.193
John Breaker...

816
00:47:29.585 --> 00:47:32.980
And now all the boss
can talk about

817
00:47:33.154 --> 00:47:37.158
is having the famous
John Breaker within his reach.

818
00:47:38.594 --> 00:47:43.861
Any old outlaw could make
history off the death of you.

819
00:47:49.736 --> 00:47:51.216
Well. you tell
Yule Bronson

820
00:47:51.346 --> 00:47:54.567
that the marshal and
the deputy are here to stay.

821
00:48:00.616 --> 00:48:04.664
And make sure he knows that
these cornered dogs

822
00:48:04.838 --> 00:48:06.753
would do a lot more than bark.

823
00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:12.498
It's time. Buge-

824
00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:13.629
Time for what?

825
00:48:13.803 --> 00:48:15.066
To run.

826
00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:27.774
Shoot 'em. get 'em!

827
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.213
C'mon Buge-!

828
00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:33.649
Get 'em!

829
00:48:39.046 --> 00:48:40.526
Get in here.

830
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.701
Just shoot 'em!

831
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.580
See those other two?

832
00:48:57.108 --> 00:48:59.023
Dad. he's about to
light the bank on fire...

833
00:48:59.197 --> 00:49:00.763
around the corner!

834
00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.940
Oh. no you don't.

835
00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:11.731
Got him.

836
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.173
Just shoot 'em!

837
00:49:29.357 --> 00:49:32.186
He just missed me;
I'm invincible.

838
00:49:34.884 --> 00:49:37.017
They're running.

839
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.380
The rain falls on the just
and the unjust alike.

840
00:49:52.598 --> 00:49:54.295
Dad.

841
00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:56.080
Char!

842
00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:58.082
No. no.

843
00:50:00.649 --> 00:50:02.260
It's still in there.

844
00:50:02.477 --> 00:50:04.175
The bullet is still in there.

845
00:50:04.392 --> 00:50:06.133
Buge. help me move him.

846
00:50:06.307 --> 00:50:08.527
Chuck. help me find a knife
and some bandages.

847
00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:20.539
Who's gonna do it?

848
00:50:22.715 --> 00:50:23.672
Uh...

849
00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:25.718
Buge?

850
00:50:26.719 --> 00:50:28.242
Char?

851
00:50:28.416 --> 00:50:30.331
Ooh. didn't you pull a bullet
out of Buge way back when?

852
00:50:30.462 --> 00:50:32.029
Yeah.

853
00:50:32.203 --> 00:50:33.769
But I was mad at
him at the time.

854
00:50:33.943 --> 00:50:35.032
What?

855
00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:36.729
Well. don't look at me.

856
00:50:36.903 --> 00:50:37.947
I can't even pull
a splinter without hacking

857
00:50:38.122 --> 00:50:39.166
off half my thumb.

858
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.646
Stop drinking the blade cleaner.

859
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.995
Char. you gotta do this.

860
00:50:42.169 --> 00:50:43.344
You're the only one
with experience.

861
00:50:43.518 --> 00:50:45.216
I sew. I don't dig.

862
00:50:46.391 --> 00:50:48.654
Nobody wants to do it.

863
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:51.004
But somebody's got
to do it all right.

864
00:50:51.178 --> 00:50:53.137
I dug for gold
half my life.

865
00:50:55.139 --> 00:50:57.097
Guess I can dig
for lead. too.

866
00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:06.498
Ooh.

867
00:51:21.208 --> 00:51:25.082
♪ ...fell into
the foaming brine ♪

868
00:51:25.212 --> 00:51:29.216

869
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:33.002

872
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:51.195
You sure have been good
to dad since mom died.

873
00:51:52.544 --> 00:51:54.589
She was his anchor.

874
00:51:56.287 --> 00:51:58.202
I guess that's what
I've become.

875
00:52:01.683 --> 00:52:03.294
Can't say it

876
00:52:03.468 --> 00:52:05.383
hasn't been good
for me too.

877
00:52:07.298 --> 00:52:09.996
I just hate seeing you
caught up in all his mess.

878
00:52:11.432 --> 00:52:13.826
John. his mess
is my mess.

879
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.654
The people of this town
have supported me

880
00:52:15.828 --> 00:52:17.308
for a very
long time.

881
00:52:18.657 --> 00:52:20.485
They're my family
now. too.

882
00:52:21.616 --> 00:52:23.575
And I will fight
for them.

883
00:52:25.446 --> 00:52:28.014
I'm a Breaker
after all.

884
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.102
Oh. I did...

885
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.973
miss my sister.

886
00:52:59.437 --> 00:53:00.960
See anything?

887
00:53:03.092 --> 00:53:06.705
All those graves.

888
00:53:06.835 --> 00:53:08.707
Those are
the bank's graves.

889
00:53:09.708 --> 00:53:12.580
Miners mostly.
who came to us.

890
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:13.842
Miners?

891
00:53:14.016 --> 00:53:15.192
If you're a miner

892
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:17.542
this bank is the first
sign of safety.

893
00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:20.240
It's the only hope
for miles.

894
00:53:20.371 --> 00:53:22.982
Haven't had much through
here though in a while.

895
00:53:23.156 --> 00:53:25.376
Not until you and John.

896
00:53:29.554 --> 00:53:31.382
How did you and John meet?

897
00:53:36.778 --> 00:53:38.693
He had a warrant
for my arrest.

898
00:53:39.912 --> 00:53:41.522
For what?

899
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.524
I stole
from a farm.

900
00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:45.613
What?

901
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:47.267
What happened?

902
00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:48.529
He arrested me.

903
00:53:51.184 --> 00:53:53.752
Those Breaker boys are
one of a kind.

904
00:54:07.026 --> 00:54:10.290
Our families had gone west.

905
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:17.471
But... Water Lilly and
me. we loved the east.

906
00:54:17.645 --> 00:54:20.344
So. after she...

907
00:54:23.999 --> 00:54:25.958
got sick...

908
00:54:26.088 --> 00:54:28.221
and after she...

909
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.489
I was lost.

910
00:54:41.365 --> 00:54:43.541
I was real lost.

911
00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:48.372
But John. you know...

912
00:54:52.637 --> 00:54:54.291
He saw through me.

913
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:59.470
He saw that I wasn't bad.

914
00:55:01.559 --> 00:55:03.169
I was desperate.

915
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:08.174
So instead of jail

916
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:11.308
he took me to that
farmer I stole from.

917
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.138
I worked for that man until

918
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:18.140
I paid for what I took.

919
00:55:22.014 --> 00:55:24.843
I paid for what I took.

920
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.978
So...

921
00:55:30.152 --> 00:55:33.939
here I am eating beans
with John's sister

922
00:55:34.113 --> 00:55:36.333
on a beautiful day.

923
00:55:37.725 --> 00:55:39.684
In the middle
of a siege.

924
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:43.165
in the middle of a desert.

925
00:55:43.383 --> 00:55:45.254
With little hope
of escape.

926
00:55:53.524 --> 00:55:55.787
It's a helpless feeling
to not be able to save

927
00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:57.528
the ones you love.

928
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:07.102
Mark. my Mark...

929
00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:09.148
You never met him. did you?

930
00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:11.280
No.

931
00:56:11.455 --> 00:56:14.762
You're very different
men but I...

932
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.156
I believe you
would've loved him.

933
00:56:18.026 --> 00:56:19.767
Every once and a while when

934
00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:23.641
a man fell sick Mark would
lend a hand down at the mine.

935
00:56:23.815 --> 00:56:28.559
And out here in a new town
everybody depends on everybody.

936
00:56:30.952 --> 00:56:34.347
And one day...

937
00:56:34.521 --> 00:56:37.785
the mine came down
on itself.

938
00:56:38.003 --> 00:56:39.918
And it just so happened it
was the mine where Mark

939
00:56:40.048 --> 00:56:41.789
was lending a hand.

940
00:56:48.361 --> 00:56:52.017
I waited until they
cleared all the rocks

941
00:56:52.234 --> 00:56:56.413
away to be sure. but...

942
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.806
As soon as it happened.
I knew.

943
00:57:06.858 --> 00:57:09.556
It's a helpless feeling
not to be able to...

944
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.950
save the ones you love.

945
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.130
Makes it hard
to love again.

946
00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.141
Hard but not
impossible.

947
00:57:41.675 --> 00:57:43.068
All right. we hit him
hard.

948
00:57:43.242 --> 00:57:44.896
Harder than expected.

949
00:57:45.113 --> 00:57:46.854
They've been slow to
get up. so we know

950
00:57:47.028 --> 00:57:48.377
they're gonna get us tonight.

951
00:57:48.508 --> 00:57:50.292
At this rate of fire
we've got one fight.

952
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:52.294
maybe two before we're
out of bullets.

953
00:57:52.512 --> 00:57:54.862
We've got another day tops
till we're out of food.

954
00:57:54.993 --> 00:57:57.082
Two for water.

955
00:57:57.256 --> 00:57:58.649
What about
the judge?

956
00:57:58.823 --> 00:58:00.433
No fever. no problem.

957
00:58:00.607 --> 00:58:02.391
I think we've got the
bleeding under control.

958
00:58:02.522 --> 00:58:03.741
All right. let's give
him a gun.

959
00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:05.438
John. dad needs to rest.

960
00:58:05.612 --> 00:58:06.744
We can't depend on
him right now.

961
00:58:06.918 --> 00:58:08.267
I'm not talking
about dad.

962
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:10.269
No way.

963
00:58:10.443 --> 00:58:12.271
-His fight is our fight.
- You can't be serious.

964
00:58:12.445 --> 00:58:13.794
He'll shoot
us in the back the first

965
00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:15.796
chance he gets.
We die. he dies.

966
00:58:15.927 --> 00:58:17.276
That was proven to him
in the desert.

967
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:18.930
He's got nothing to gain.

968
00:58:19.104 --> 00:58:22.542
He's a dead man walking.
whether we win or lose.

969
00:58:22.673 --> 00:58:24.370
It's a mistake to think that-
Shh!

970
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.552
♪ Oh my darlin' Clementine ♪

971
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:39.080
It's Old Bill Shoemaker.

972
00:58:39.254 --> 00:58:41.474
♪ Clementine ♪

973
00:58:41.605 --> 00:58:45.130
♪ Oh my darlin'.
Oh my darlin' ♪

974
00:58:45.347 --> 00:58:46.653
He'll never make it.

975
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:49.656
They're already here.

976
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:56.315
Look what
we got here. boys!

977
00:58:56.489 --> 00:58:57.795
All right...

978
00:58:57.969 --> 00:58:59.840
you go upstairs. stay down.
and don't fire

979
00:59:00.014 --> 00:59:01.625
unless they head this way.

980
00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:03.931
Buge- you and I will go out
back.

981
00:59:04.105 --> 00:59:04.976
Chuck...

982
00:59:05.193 --> 00:59:06.543
you stay here.

983
00:59:06.717 --> 00:59:08.240
And if they come
through that door

984
00:59:08.414 --> 00:59:10.547
you blast them to kingdom come.

985
00:59:13.593 --> 00:59:15.813
Hand over
the gold. old man.

986
00:59:15.943 --> 00:59:17.336
Leave me alone!

987
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:18.946
I worked hard for this gold.

988
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.644
You hear that. fellas?

989
00:59:20.818 --> 00:59:22.994
This old boy worked hard.

990
00:59:23.168 --> 00:59:24.604
All right. enough.

991
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.695
Mercy...
Wait!

992
00:59:28.913 --> 00:59:30.610
No-

993
00:59:51.805 --> 00:59:53.328
I heard a shot.

994
00:59:53.546 --> 00:59:55.113
Tell me he made it.

995
00:59:56.723 --> 00:59:58.203
Murdering. theivin'

996
00:59:58.377 --> 01:00:00.118
sons of nightriders.

997
01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:03.121
He never had a chance.

998
01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:06.690
What's all
the shooting about?

999
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.648
Anybody hurt?
Dad.

1000
01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:09.997
Dad. dad!

1001
01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:11.520
Whoa...

1002
01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:18.615
Dad. you're burnin' up.

1003
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:20.486
Another miner. judge.

1004
01:00:22.183 --> 01:00:25.056
Another grave for nothing.

1005
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.884
Another man scratchin'
his life away...

1006
01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.494
just to be shot in the back.

1007
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:31.062
Dad!

1008
01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:33.107
He's bleeding again.

1009
01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:36.676
He needs to see

1010
01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:38.069
a doctor fast.

1011
01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.245
Where's Bugle?

1012
01:00:40.462 --> 01:00:42.073
Hey. Marshal?

1013
01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:44.336
Got something of yours.

1014
01:00:47.992 --> 01:00:49.646
Where's Bugle?!

1015
01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.560
Is that his name?

1016
01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:52.997
Is he alive?

1017
01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:55.347
Yule Bronson don't strike deals.

1018
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.828
He's alive for now.

1019
01:00:58.002 --> 01:01:00.613
He's alive. dad.
He's bait.

1020
01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.963
He's my brother.

1021
01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.965
Parlay at midnight.

1022
01:01:05.096 --> 01:01:06.358
Be alone.

1023
01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:23.549
You've got quite a family.

1024
01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:27.031
Well. you haven't met
the half of them.

1025
01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:29.381
Where's Bugle?

1026
01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:31.644
With the boss.

1027
01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:33.602
Where's the boss?

1028
01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.474
Watchin'...

1029
01:01:35.648 --> 01:01:37.432
Where is he?

1030
01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:39.217
I haven't had the pleasure.

1031
01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:41.480
I would love the chance...

1032
01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:43.351
Chance to what?

1033
01:01:50.184 --> 01:01:53.144
Just return the gold and
we'll release your friend.

1034
01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:55.102
If you hurt him...

1035
01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:58.671
You got till sunrise or we'll
drop that deputy's body

1036
01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:00.934
right here in the street.

1037
01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.806
Try to get him
before the buzzards.

1038
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.938
They can be nasty.

1039
01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:22.521
That's it... we're
trading the gold for Bugle.

1040
01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.131
John. we can't.

1041
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:26.177
If we don't they'll
kill him. dad.

1042
01:02:26.394 --> 01:02:27.395
-Son...
-No. no. no.

1043
01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:28.919
This is not negotiable.

1044
01:02:29.093 --> 01:02:31.443
It's a human life
for a bunch of rocks.

1045
01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:37.057
Show him
the vault.

1046
01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:02.517
-Char. I don't-
-Shh!

1047
01:03:02.691 --> 01:03:04.476
Let's talk outside.

1048
01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:30.763
All this violence

1049
01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:32.243
for an empty vault.

1050
01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:33.548
We never...

1051
01:03:33.722 --> 01:03:35.463
said there was gold
in the vault.

1052
01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:38.249
All the men that I've killed
to bring Deadeye here!

1053
01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:40.294
All the men that I've killed
for an empty vault!

1054
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.993
And now my dad's shot and
my best friend's about to die!

1055
01:03:45.343 --> 01:03:48.650
We all chose this
dance. John...

1056
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:51.828
so don't be surprised
the band's not free.

1057
01:03:52.002 --> 01:03:54.395
If you weren't prepared to die
you shouldn't have stayed.

1058
01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:56.223
Your fights are my
fights. dad.

1059
01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:59.879
Then this is the
fight.

1060
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.663
This is the fight.

1061
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:09.149
Remember when you
gave me that scar?

1062
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.934
The scar?

1063
01:04:11.108 --> 01:04:12.544
Yes.

1064
01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:16.504
That rustler--
What was his name?

1065
01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.811
The man was gonna kill him
and he can't remember his name.

1066
01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:20.334
Oh. you
remember the names

1067
01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:22.597
of all the men that
tried to kill you?

1068
01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:25.644
Jackson Flint. he had
a knife to your throat.

1069
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.168
You were twelve.
You had an old

1070
01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:30.823
coyote killer that I gave ya.

1071
01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:32.694
And I'm glad I did

1072
01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.653
because you saved my life.

1073
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.962
And I...

1074
01:04:39.136 --> 01:04:40.615
gave you that scar.

1075
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:42.574
Well. I'll...

1076
01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:46.012
I'll take this one over the one
Jackson Flint intended to give.

1077
01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:49.407
What's your point dad?
Doing what's right

1078
01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:53.802
comes with a cost. every time.

1079
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:59.069
You know. breaking the law.
giving up. that's easy.

1080
01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:04.683
But shooting a man to save
your dad. knowing you're

1081
01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:06.772
gonna hit your dad...

1082
01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.864
that's hard.

1083
01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:14.780
But it was right.

1084
01:05:24.529 --> 01:05:26.009
Okay.

1085
01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:28.185
What do we do next?

1086
01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.013
I don't know.

1087
01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:32.276
That's not the answer
I was looking for. dad.

1088
01:05:37.672 --> 01:05:39.500
I know what
you are gonna do.

1089
01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.024
You're gonna wrap that

1090
01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:44.070
in a box and you are gonna
deliver it yourself.

1091
01:05:44.244 --> 01:05:45.463
I'm--

1092
01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:52.035
In a box.

1093
01:05:52.252 --> 01:05:54.124
Deliver it in a...

1094
01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.999
Do me a favor.

1095
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.348
Hold that for me. would ya?

1096
01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:02.393
What?

1097
01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:03.655
I got a plan.

1098
01:06:28.462 --> 01:06:30.551
What's happening. John?
It's a risk.

1099
01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.075
But it's all we got.

1100
01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:33.554
You and you

1101
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.252
are getting
in the chests.

1102
01:06:35.426 --> 01:06:37.254
What?
Listen. we lug you up

1103
01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:39.125
there. they're gonna
think you're gold.

1104
01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.345
They're gonna bring up Bugle
and when they open the chests

1105
01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:43.129
you come out guns a'blazin.

1106
01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.088
We'll draw with ya.
That's the plan?

1107
01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.613
Char. fighting them like this
is the only chance we have

1108
01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:50.876
to getting Bugle back
and dad to a doctor.

1109
01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:54.401
All right.

1110
01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:57.622
I'll do it.
Well that sobers my manner.

1111
01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:02.496
Well...

1112
01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:05.238
ain't like I ain't used
to dark. cramped places.

1113
01:07:05.412 --> 01:07:07.066
Let's go.

1114
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.074
You're out of time. Marshal.

1115
01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:28.087
What-- what's happening?

1116
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:29.915
I need your help.

1117
01:07:33.397 --> 01:07:36.878
If you ever wanted a chance
at redemption...

1118
01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:38.750
this is it.

1119
01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:44.669
What's the plan?

1120
01:07:44.843 --> 01:07:46.323
Help me move these.

1121
01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:48.847
What you've given up.
you're giving them the gold?

1122
01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:50.414
Something like that.

1123
01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:51.850
I told ya.

1124
01:07:52.024 --> 01:07:53.678
Yule don't care
about the gold.

1125
01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:56.159
Yeah. but I bet
his men do.

1126
01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:57.769
C'mon.

1127
01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:02.904
Last chance. Marshal.

1128
01:08:47.079 --> 01:08:49.299
Unload 'em.

1129
01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:55.696
I said...

1130
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.003
unload them.

1131
01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:06.011
Where's Bugle?

1132
01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:27.163
They brought the gold?

1133
01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:32.777
Satisfied?

1134
01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:34.518
Yule couldn't make it?

1135
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.402
Deadeye...

1136
01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:51.361
what are you doing?

1137
01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:55.887
Deadeye never made
it out of the desert.

1138
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.546
Just you
wait. brother.

1139
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.330
You've gone and stepped
in it now. you--

1140
01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:06.376
You don't even know!

1141
01:10:10.858 --> 01:10:12.599
John Breaker's like a train.

1142
01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:14.558
Once he's on your track
he doesn't stop till

1143
01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:15.994
he gets where he's going.

1144
01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:18.170
And he's coming for you.

1145
01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:20.216
You don't even know it.

1146
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.348
Yeah. that bank. that judge.

1147
01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:25.090
Once he gets his teeth
sunk into you...

1148
01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:30.617
He's comin' for y'all.

1149
01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:33.577
All of y'all-

1150
01:10:43.064 --> 01:10:45.066
Wait.

1151
01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.025
Give me that eye patch.

1152
01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:49.114
Your mercy
precedes you. Marshal.

1153
01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:51.769
Which means you're gullible.

1154
01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:54.206
Trusting. which
means you're weak.

1155
01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.948
I knew you were gonna
lead me to this bank.

1156
01:10:57.122 --> 01:10:58.645
Just had to...

1157
01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:01.126
bide my time waiting for
just the right moment.

1158
01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:05.609
Like this.

1159
01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:11.702
Drop the weapon.Marshal.

1160
01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:14.139
I said...drop it.

1161
01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:16.054
Say the word.

1162
01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:29.285
Good choice.

1163
01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:31.678
How about where are
them other two?

1164
01:11:31.809 --> 01:11:33.941
They're with
my father.

1165
01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:35.029
Oh yeah?

1166
01:11:35.203 --> 01:11:36.640
Still alive?

1167
01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:38.381
Stubborn.

1168
01:11:39.947 --> 01:11:41.906
Stubborn Breakers.

1169
01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:48.652
It don't seem quite right.

1170
01:11:56.094 --> 01:11:57.922
You take the deputy and
them crates on inside.

1171
01:11:58.096 --> 01:11:59.532
If it's not gold...

1172
01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:00.751
kill them.

1173
01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.405
That wasn't part
of the deal.

1174
01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:04.929
Since when are you in a
position to make a deal?

1175
01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:06.539
We open the chests

1176
01:12:06.713 --> 01:12:07.975
here.

1177
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:09.629
We exchange the gold here.

1178
01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:11.370
Gold for Bugle.

1179
01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:13.024
That was the deal.

1180
01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:24.252
All right.

1181
01:12:24.427 --> 01:12:26.516
Get movin'.

1182
01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:28.518
Don't do anything stupid.

1183
01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:42.706
You ever seen the Pacific?

1184
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.058
No.

1185
01:12:47.232 --> 01:12:49.103
I have.

1186
01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.279
My brother and I worked
on a fishing vessel

1187
01:12:51.454 --> 01:12:53.717
before uh...

1188
01:12:53.891 --> 01:12:56.067
before the war.

1189
01:12:56.937 --> 01:12:58.548
You fish?

1190
01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:03.161
I hunt.

1191
01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:09.210
So at the end
of each day we'd...

1192
01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:11.691
clean our catch. you know?

1193
01:13:11.822 --> 01:13:14.041
The guts and the blood.
we would just throw it

1194
01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:16.000
in the water and
that's when the...

1195
01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:20.483
you oughtta see
it someday Marshal.

1196
01:13:20.657 --> 01:13:22.572
That's when
the sharks appear.

1197
01:13:26.227 --> 01:13:28.534
Come out of the depths
of nowhere and just

1198
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:31.407
swarm and rip the
water to shreds.

1199
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.414
Killin' a whole town...

1200
01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:42.940
that's reward enough.

1201
01:13:44.028 --> 01:13:45.551
Killin' you...

1202
01:13:46.944 --> 01:13:50.426
killin' your father.
your deputy...

1203
01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:54.299
your sister...

1204
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.822
that's a bonus.

1205
01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:07.530
You were right about
my men though.

1206
01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:08.835
My men don't find...

1207
01:14:09.009 --> 01:14:10.968
gold in those chests...

1208
01:14:11.098 --> 01:14:15.320
they will rip you and yours
apart stem to stern.

1209
01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:18.279
And I'm gonna start
with your sister.

1210
01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:53.750
Kill him!

1211
01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:44.148
Yule.

1212
01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:58.031
It has to be here.

1213
01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:12.437
Where is the gold?

1214
01:16:20.532 --> 01:16:22.447
Where's my gold?

1215
01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:24.754
Don't do it. kid.

1216
01:16:33.153 --> 01:16:34.807
Finally.

1217
01:16:38.855 --> 01:16:42.032
You know the difference
between men like my father

1218
01:16:42.206 --> 01:16:44.121
and monsters like you?

1219
01:16:46.036 --> 01:16:47.951
They die as cowards...

1220
01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:50.170
every time.

1221
01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.303
Man or monster...

1222
01:16:53.478 --> 01:16:56.829
Dad is dead.

1223
01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.487
They say it's mercy.

1224
01:17:02.705 --> 01:17:04.881
Oh?

1225
01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:07.753
Oh. was that
the gun I gave you?

1226
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:14.630
Yule Bronson. you're under
arrest for the murder

1227
01:17:14.804 --> 01:17:16.588
of your own brother.
And the murder of

1228
01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.895
Marshal McKosky and
his deputy.

1229
01:17:19.025 --> 01:17:21.680
And for all the men
and woman you murdered

1230
01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:24.204
and all the graves I had
to dig on your account.

1231
01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:26.816
And I assure
you. you will

1232
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:29.166
hang by the neck
until you are dead.

1233
01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:31.211
Dad.

1234
01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:33.561
Dad!

1235
01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:35.172
Dad!

1236
01:17:35.346 --> 01:17:37.261
Dad...
Bugle. Chuck.

1237
01:17:37.435 --> 01:17:39.263
Lock him in the vault.

1238
01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:45.182
John. he's dying.
I'll get a doctor.

1239
01:17:45.312 --> 01:17:47.445
John. he can't ride.

1240
01:17:47.619 --> 01:17:49.055
Then I'll bring a doctor back.

1241
01:17:49.186 --> 01:17:50.753
I told ya.

1242
01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:53.103
I wasn't leaving this town.

1243
01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:58.412
I know you're stubborn.

1244
01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:00.850

The judge. he's hurt real bad.

I'll be

Let me fetch my bag.

1261
01:19:38.382 --> 01:19:40.514
Hyah. hyah. hyah!

1262
01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:44.170
Char. Char!

1263
01:19:48.522 --> 01:19:51.264
Doc. he's inside.
let's go.

1264
01:19:51.395 --> 01:19:54.093
How is he?

1265
01:19:54.267 --> 01:19:56.487
Char. how is he?

1266
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.985
Miners will
be coming back now.

1267
01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:02.031
Coming back for what's theirs!

1268
01:21:02.205 --> 01:21:05.034
A coffin full
of gold.

1269
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:06.731
A graveyard

1270
01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:08.864
instead of a vault.

1271
01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:11.779
Every number on
a cross is an account

1272
01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:14.521
- a bank account.

1273
01:21:14.739 --> 01:21:17.307
And this is mine.

1274
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:19.526
Every number
corresponds to a name

1275
01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:21.833
in a book inside.

1276
01:21:23.008 --> 01:21:25.271
Just like any bank.

1277
01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:27.839
Not like any bank
I ever heard of.

1278
01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:29.928
You kept me in the dark
the whole time. didn't ya?

1279
01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:31.538
Couldn't
have a softy like you

1280
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:34.890
trading our hope
to save our lives.

1281
01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:36.674
You're as hard as
the old man.

1282
01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:39.720
You'll get there. son.

1283
01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.593
Just keep on being
the last man standing.

1284
01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:52.603
I thought
you miss the trees.

1285
01:21:55.475 --> 01:21:57.042
I do.

1286
01:21:58.435 --> 01:22:00.263
I thought you
hated the heat.

1287
01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:06.225
I'll warm up to it.
Mmhmm.

1288
01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:10.926
Well. I guess the good
thing is I traded a--

1289
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.146
traded a deputy
for a brother.

1290
01:22:18.368 --> 01:22:21.501
We've always been
brothers. John.

1291
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.547
Yeah.

1292
01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:27.246
I suppose so.

1293
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.381
We leavin' or what?

1294
01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:34.775
Give that great grandbaby
a big kiss for me. okay?

1295
01:22:34.993 --> 01:22:37.430
I'm gonna miss you.
little girl.

1296
01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:48.137
Take care of
my daughter.

1297
01:22:49.181 --> 01:22:51.140
Take care of this town.

1298
01:22:55.927 --> 01:22:57.494
I'll uh--

1299
01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:01.150
I'll see you
around. Sheriff.

1300
01:23:13.466 --> 01:23:16.252
You know. there are
few rules I travel by.

1301
01:23:16.426 --> 01:23:18.602
You run. I shoot.

1302
01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:20.647
Please. by all
means. run.

1303
01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:22.345
You talk...

1304
01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:24.521
we gag.

1305
01:23:24.738 --> 01:23:26.305
You've learned
that already.

1306
01:23:26.479 --> 01:23:29.395
And lastly. you snore-
I shoot.

1307
01:23:33.225 --> 01:23:35.488
Let's go. hyah!
