3
00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:16.558
Come on!

4
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.405
Well. I will tell
you. Cassandra.

5
00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.490
{\an8}it is great to see Chen
back on American soil

6
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.285
{\an8}after a three year hiatus
playing for Paris Saint-Germain.

7
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.202
Over in Europe.

8
00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.537
You're so right. Nick.

9
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.955
{\an8}But it's really
hard not to notice

10
00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.874
{\an8}that there is a real
sharpness to Chen's play

11
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.459
that we are just not
used to seeing from her.

12
00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.710
I absolutely
agree with that.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.461
Oh.
there she goes.

14
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.503
{\an8}There she goes.

15
00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:46.796
{\an8}Oh. down the line.

16
00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.881
{\an8}she is setting up
for another attack.

17
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.227
{\an8}Offside.

18
00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.022
{\an8}That was not offside!
That was a goal.

19
00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.523
{\an8}It was offside.

20
00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:06.358
{\an8}Hey. hey. you've
already got a yellow card.

21
00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:07.692
{\an8}She's wrong!

22
00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.072
{\an8}Hey. ref. you better
check your cell.

23
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.490
{\an8}You've been making
wrong calls all game.

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.241
{\an8}What is she doing?

25
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.577
No. no. no. no.

26
00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.162
{\an8}Look at Coach's
reaction to that.

27
00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.331
{\an8}And this is exactly what
we've been seeing from her

28
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.124
{\an8}over the last while. isn't it?

29
00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:23.917
Enough!

30
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.597
And it is all over.

31
00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.683
{\an8}Portland 2. Chicago 1.

32
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:40.767
{\an8}That was a
tough loss for the home team.

33
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.435
Coach Avila does not look happy.

34
00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.353
She does not.

35
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.105
And why would she be?

36
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.148
{\an8}That's the third game Chen's
been ejected from this season.

37
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.361
{\an8}Sorry. Em. that
was a bad call.

38
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.822
{\an8}When I'm in the zone. all
I think about is a goal.

39
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:54.906
{\an8}I know.

40
00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.741
That's what makes you so good.

41
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.326
{\an8}but also gets you in trouble.

42
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.746
{\an8}How do you stay
so level-headed?

43
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.455
Journaling.

44
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.417
Hey. come out with
us for a change.

45
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.296
Nah. thanks though.

46
00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.089
Okay.

47
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:12.966
Chen.

48
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.262
You.

49
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.763
My office.

50
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:27.981
When did you start doing that?

51
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.357
It's supposed to be calming.

52
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.361
Right now. I could
use some calm.

53
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.371
Do you know why we signed you?

54
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.082
'Cause I'm the top
scorer of the league.

55
00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:49.836
That. and I thought you could
mentor the younger players.

56
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.173
impart some knowledge
beyond your skills.

57
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.300
But your most notable
moment this season

58
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.427
was pouring your
sports drink on a ref.

59
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.012
That was a bad
call. and you know it.

60
00:02:59.012 --> 00:02:59.929
Just like today.

61
00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.639
I wasn't offside!

62
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.432
That was a goal.

63
00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:03.808
Maybe.

64
00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.352
But if you already
got a yellow card.

65
00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.145
you have to know you
can't argue with the ref!

66
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.022
- But I-
- But you did!

67
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.732
And got ejected.

68
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.860
So we played one man down.
and lost because of it.

69
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.904
If you were anyone else.
I'd have cut you sooner.

70
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.530
So. what?

71
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.491
I'm being reprimanded
because of some lousy ref?

72
00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.452
No. you're not
getting reprimanded.

73
00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.995
You're getting suspended.

74
00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.498
It's not a joke.

75
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.541
I've turned in the paperwork.

76
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.543
You're suspended indefinitely.

77
00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.380
for conduct detrimental
to the team.

78
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.632
But I scored half
the goals this season.

79
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.300
You're an amazing player.

80
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.135
You always have been.

81
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.137
You are a great teammate.

82
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.098
but lately you've
become a liability.

83
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.227
I can do better.

84
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.814
Look. I can't
begin to understand

85
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.607
how it's been since
losing Caroline.

86
00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.695
which is why I let it
go as far as it did.

87
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.530
But I can't allow
this kind of behavior.

88
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.577
Please. Coach.

89
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.588
Thank you for
an amazing season.

90
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.133
But get some rest. Chen.

91
00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.182
What's she thinking?
She can't do that.

92
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.767
I'll start a petition.

93
00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.102
And say what?

94
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.937
That you're Emily
freaking Chen.

95
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.689
Gold medalist.

96
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.899
You've won the World
Cup three times.

97
00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.110
Only two people have
scored more goals than you

98
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.279
in the history of
American soccer.

99
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.780
And yet I still got suspended.

100
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.411
I'm sure you can fix this.

101
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.079
And I'm sure Coach
will come around.

102
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.460
I'm glad you're
sure. 'cause I'm not.

103
00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.133
You know I got you.

104
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.097
And the Chicago
Premier have announced

105
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.932
that their leading
scorer. Emily Chen.

106
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.768
has been suspended indefinitely.

107
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.501
Hey. B. what's up?

108
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.211
Oh. nothing.

109
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.505
Ava and I were just watching
some sports highlights.

110
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:40.799
Hi. Cucu.

111
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.800
Hi. Ava.

112
00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.386
I hope you didn't watch mine.

113
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.512
We did.

114
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.721
Which is why I was thinking-

115
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.682
We were thinking.

116
00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:51.017
Sorry. we.

117
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.811
We were thinking this
would be the perfect time

118
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.479
for you to come visit us.

119
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.981
Be surrounded by
people who love you.

120
00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.191
Now is not a good time.

121
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.317
I gotta train.

122
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.485
Train here.

123
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.861
Please. Cucu.

124
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.446
You can come watch
one of my games.

125
00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.449
We haven't seen you
in like. forever.

126
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.661
Like pre-folklore era. ever.

127
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.413
Post-reputation for sure.

128
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.874
But we measure time
by Taylor albums.

129
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:15.709
Taylor who?

130
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.879
I'm gonna forget
you just said that.

131
00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.131
Well. we've decided
you're coming.

132
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:21.923
So...

133
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.721
You're probably gonna
wanna check that.

134
00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.227
It's economy class because
I'm a social worker.

135
00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.770
But I trust you'll
be comfortable.

136
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.356
Come on. Em.

137
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.150
You need us.

138
00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.403
Fine.

139
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.821
Yes!

140
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:45.739
I'll see you soon.

141
00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.086
Hey. guys!

142
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:08.303
Mm.

143
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:17.771
Ava. Brandon.

144
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.147
Hey!

145
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.065
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

146
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.441
Flat white with oat. please.

147
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.277
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.029
Our espresso machine is broken.

149
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.907
and the oats just
didn't wanna be milked.

150
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:31.785
Just a coffee.

151
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.786
Black.

152
00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:33.620
Mhm.

153
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.084
Thank you.

154
00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.797
Another oat milker.

155
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.258
It's what I've been
telling you. Sandra.

156
00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.802
You may not agree with it.

157
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:51.638
but if you don't start
carrying oat milk products.

158
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:52.889
it's gonna cost you.

159
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.099
And besides the upcharge.

160
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.767
it's gonna pay for itself.

161
00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.478
But why would anybody pay
more for watered down oats?

162
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.397
It just makes no sense.

163
00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.731
It doesn't have to make sense.

164
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.441
People want what people want.

165
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.819
and you want me to help your
business make you more money.

166
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:06.695
So...

167
00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:08.697
Alt milk.

168
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.158
We'll put it in the report.

169
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.118
Okay.

170
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.994
I'll put it in the report.

171
00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.455
I'm so glad you're
coming to my game tomorrow.

172
00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.832
Me too.

173
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.249
I can't wait for
you to meet my coach.

174
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.667
Mhm!

175
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.584
Ava. do you think
you could go stake out

176
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.585
the pie situation?

177
00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.461
Mhm.

178
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.462
It's 10:00 AM.

179
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.256
And we're getting it to go.

180
00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.257
I'm not an animal.

181
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.299
Just forward thinking.

182
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.384
On it.

183
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.223
I'm glad you're here.

184
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.267
but I wish it didn't take
something as catastrophic

185
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.227
as you being suspended
to come to town.

186
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.232
Look. I know you and Ava
watch games over video chat.

187
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:47.318
but that's no substitute
for you not being here.

188
00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.486
You know. with Caroline gone.

189
00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.156
you're the closest
thing she has to a mom.

190
00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:52.407
Ava misses you. you know?

191
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.410
No pressure.

192
00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:57.704
That's not fair.

193
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:01.875
You're right.

194
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.047
I'll do better.

195
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.174
Thanks.

196
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.393
Why do you insist
on wearing all that?

197
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.188
Because. I've trained
with you before.

198
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.493
Did you find out
what's going on with Ava?

199
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.786
That kid's a closed book.

200
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.622
She'll come around.

201
00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.755
You know. I would
say it's not fair

202
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.425
that you got all the athletic
talent in the family but...

203
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.263
I did get all the
good looks. so.

204
00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.015
Mhm.

205
00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.058
Oh!

206
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.420
Cucu. it's so early.

207
00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:38.388
I love that photo of us.

208
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.181
Your mom scored three
goals in that game.

209
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:43.852
You know what her
post-game demand was?

210
00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:44.769
Donuts.

211
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:55.321
You. me. your mom...

212
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.532
Donuts.

213
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.954
I miss her so much.

214
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:07.834
Me too.

215
00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.382
But seriously. are you
gonna eat the donuts?

216
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:18.261
'Cause I thought you
were on training mode.

217
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.179
Mm...

218
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.305
I'll eat carbs for you.

219
00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.057
Ooh.

220
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.101
Mhm.

221
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.863
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

222
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:37.864
Ah. come on!

223
00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.199
There you go.

224
00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.702
Nice!

225
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.870
Yeah.
yeah. there. there!

226
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.997
Hey. hey. hey.

227
00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.290
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

228
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.125
All right. volleyball.

229
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.877
Hey. A little help.

230
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:51.711
Hey.

231
00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:54.839
Oh.

232
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:55.423
You wanna play. don't you?

233
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.051
That obvious?

234
00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.427
Yeah.

235
00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.137
I mean. we need. you
know. another player.

236
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.889
We'll be huffling.

237
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.558
Well. nobody really
stretches that long.

238
00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:07.394
Not true.

239
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.353
Yeah?

240
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.397
Yogis. gymnasts.

241
00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.066
People who have bad backs.

242
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.109
And which one are you?

243
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.488
Okay. fine.

244
00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.531
Yeah?

245
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.116
Hey. I got you guys a player.

246
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:23.410
Go get warmed up.

247
00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:25.745
All right.

248
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.914
Let's see what you got.

249
00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.088
All right. that's
enough showin' off.

250
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.058
Yes! Emily Chen is back!

251
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.439
My ankle. man.

252
00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.357
I'm so sorry.

253
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.692
It was a pickup
game. all right?

254
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.861
It's supposed to be fun.

255
00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:59.863
I think you're gonna have
to get this checked out.

256
00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.073
My brother lives down the
street. I can drive you.

257
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.701
No. you have done enough.

258
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.626
You see this all the time.

259
00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.753
- Who's there?
- Wait.

260
00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:15.587
Hey. look.

261
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.505
Stop.

262
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.548
I just...

263
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.591
What?

264
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:20.175
Hello? Brando speaking.

265
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.095
Oh. no. That's terrible.

266
00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.473
Well. I would. but it's been
years since I've played.

267
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.935
Can you just hold for a sec?

268
00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.481
Ava's coach had some
kind of emergency.

269
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.774
They're gonna have to forfeit

270
00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.150
unless we can find
someone to fill in.

271
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:39.527
What?

272
00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.948
No. I've never coached before.

273
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.784
You're a professional
soccer player.

274
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.952
You're like the perfect person.

275
00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.287
Please?

276
00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.331
We're one win away
from the playoffs.

277
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.333
They've never been
this close before.

278
00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.423
Okay. yeah.

279
00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:01.174
Yes!

280
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:03.259
Yeah. hey.

281
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.261
My sister will do it.

282
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.513
Yeah. She'd love to.

283
00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:07.347
Okay. thanks.

284
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.181
Bye.

285
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.482
Is that your sister?

286
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.442
- Hi. Em.
- Oh. hey.

287
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:22.445
Oh!

288
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.655
Oh my gosh. you don't
even know who I am.

289
00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.740
and here I am hugging you.

290
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.283
I'm Sheila!

291
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.452
But I also answer to
"Mom" or "Hey You".

292
00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.746
or of course. "Team Parent".

293
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.707
Thank you so much for
stepping in like this.

294
00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:34.624
Of course.

295
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:35.375
Anything for Ava.

296
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.796
Okay. well. I'll let
you get to it then.

297
00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.548
Pearl Thunder! Circle up!

298
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:44.426
Okay.

299
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.886
You.

300
00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.471
You're gonna give
her your gloves.

301
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.306
and you are gonna
be a goalkeeper.

302
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.225
and you are gonna be striker.

303
00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.101
Oh.

304
00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.686
- Um...
- Interesting.

305
00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.981
Are you sure she
knows what she's doing?

306
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:01.568
Well. she's never coached
a game in her life. so. no.

307
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:04.571
We got it.

308
00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:05.405
Ready?

309
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.700
Bold choice!

310
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.743
Over here!

311
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:10.535
I'm open! I'm open!

312
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:20.170
Oh...

313
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.129
You.

314
00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.048
Whoa. Oh.

315
00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.007
How's your ankle?

316
00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:26.092
Oh. like you care.

317
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.761
Believe it or not.
I'm capable of empathy.

318
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:28.928
I feel really terrible about it.

319
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.388
Yeah? Yeah?

320
00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:31.765
My ankle is gonna be fine.

321
00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.683
It's a light sprain.
It'll heal quickly.

322
00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.517
Good.

323
00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:35.977
Mhm.

324
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.270
Did you come all the
way here for an apology?

325
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.065
This?

326
00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:41.524
This is my team.

327
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.277
And what is Alicia
doing playing striker?

328
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.904
She's good. isn't she?

329
00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:47.906
We're winning 5-1. and
she scored four of those.

330
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:48.907
You know what?

331
00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:49.908
Winning. it's not everything.

332
00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:50.909
Tell that to my trophy case.

333
00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.327
Aw. that is cute.

334
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:53.203
You know what? Thank
you for stepping in.

335
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.245
I appreciate you covering.

336
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.455
I've got it covered from here.

337
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.164
By all means.

338
00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.376
What...

339
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:03.588
Oh.

340
00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:04.964
You're welcome.

341
00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:12.847
Up. up.
up! Purple Thunder!

342
00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.015
Good job. girls.

343
00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.727
Did you see us out there?

344
00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.104
I scored four goals!

345
00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:21.439
I heard you were
on fire. yeah!

346
00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.108
But you know what. girls?

347
00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:24.693
Winning isn't everything.

348
00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.903
It certainly isn't the
most important thing.

349
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.406
What's the most important
thing is having fun. right?

350
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.615
We did!

351
00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:31.825
Because they won.

352
00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.453
Yeah.

353
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.331
Well. win or lose.
I'm proud of you.

354
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.625
I hate to be the one to bring
up the elephant in the room.

355
00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.002
but with you on crutches.

356
00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.129
you can't possibly train
the girls this week.

357
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.505
So we've all been talking.

358
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.841
and we think Emily
should stay on.

359
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.509
At least through this next game.

360
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.011
Let's get to the quarter finals!

361
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.512
Yes!

362
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.638
I don't think it's
a good idea. Sheila.

363
00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.098
Well you thought a good idea

364
00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.683
was playing your
best striker in goal.

365
00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.353
Please? Please?

366
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.566
All right. You know what?

367
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.485
Let's do this thing. huh?

368
00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.327
I gotta go finish
some homework.

369
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:17.328
What you working on?

370
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.247
Oh.

371
00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.832
Mm...

372
00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:24.753
I just have to read
something from language arts.

373
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:32.844
As the kids would say
these days. that was sus.

374
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:35.096
Agreed. But I
wouldn't worry about it.

375
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.139
She's a great kid.

376
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:38.141
Yeah. you're probably right.

377
00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.021
Hey. listen.

378
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.981
Thanks for everything.

379
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.233
It means a lot there.
helping out with Ava's team.

380
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.278
We haven't been as close
as we used to be lately.

381
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.780
Yeah?

382
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.074
Well. she's at that age.

383
00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:57.077
I'm sure there's stuff she'd
rather talk to Caroline about.

384
00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:57.869
You don't think she
wants to talk to you

385
00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.788
about her first crush?

386
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.664
Well. I don't see
why she wouldn't.

387
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.291
I'm a cool dad.

388
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.835
A cool dad would never
use the phrase "cool dad".

389
00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:08.546
Only a cool dad will
use the phrase "cool dad".

390
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.881
You're sad.

391
00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:12.217
You know. you're
the opposite of happy.

392
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:13.510
Mhm.

393
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.136
- Let me just-
- Mm-mm!

394
00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.555
Finish up here.
and give you a chance

395
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.516
to go out and explore.

396
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.601
You know. live your best life.

397
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.436
Party.
- Okay.

398
00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.313
I can take a hint.

399
00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.982
So. how are things
going in Southern Pines?

400
00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.651
Training's great.

401
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.736
I mean. there's not much to
do here. so that's a plus.

402
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.156
Did I tell you I started
coaching for Ava's team?

403
00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.074
That's awesome.

404
00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.575
Good for you.

405
00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.577
Hey. what's that behind you?

406
00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.995
Twelfth Night?

407
00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.914
Maybe you could try
your hand at acting.

408
00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.750
Sorry to disappoint.

409
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.545
but I think I've just
missed the cutoff.

410
00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:50.672
Besides. the only time that
I've ever been on stage

411
00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.842
is when I was in fourth grade
in this Can-Can musical.

412
00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.927
Please tell me you have
video evidence of that.

413
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.053
Not a chance.

414
00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.932
Well. now that
we've ruled out the theater.

415
00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.267
where are you thinking?

416
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.059
Dunno.

417
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.938
Beg coach for another chance?

418
00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:10.692
Give up any remaining shred of
dignity or self-preservation?

419
00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.027
I was more thinking.

420
00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:14.195
what are you thinking
of doing tonight?

421
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:14.988
Oh.

422
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.743
Ooh. question answered.

423
00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.202
Follow them.

424
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.412
I have to get up early.

425
00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:23.621
For what exactly?

426
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:27.334
Uh. okay. okay.

427
00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:28.793
I'm going.

428
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.929
Oh. excuse me.

429
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.139
How does this work?

430
00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.141
Oh. no solo players.

431
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.309
Need to join a team.

432
00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:45.977
Oh. Great.

433
00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:48.396
Whoa!

434
00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.440
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

435
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.816
Let me help you.

436
00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:52.609
Oh.

437
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:53.818
It's you.

438
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.320
There you are!

439
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.446
Thought you fell in the
toilet or something.

440
00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:57.322
Uh. almost.

441
00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.615
Hi. I'm Noor.

442
00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:00.658
And you are?

443
00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:01.743
Not a hugger.

444
00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.495
Uh. this is Emily.

445
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:06.664
Emily is the reason why I'm on
crutches and soaked in beer.

446
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.083
Oh.

447
00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.669
I can't tell if that's
a good or bad "ah".

448
00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.171
You know what. I've known
her since kindergarten.

449
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.839
and I can never tell either.

450
00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.758
Oh. I almost forgot why I
come over in the first place.

451
00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.510
Liz messaged to say
she can't make it.

452
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:21.471
Well. we needed four to play.

453
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:25.684
What?

454
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.605
It was really
nice to meet you.

455
00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:32.273
I have to go home.

456
00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.234
Again. I'm really sorry.

457
00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.989
You know. we need a
team of four to play.

458
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.491
Would you like to play trivia?

459
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.701
You'd be doing us a favor.

460
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.370
Yeah?

461
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.079
Yeah.

462
00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:48.707
I'd love to.

463
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.051
So. what brings you
to Southern Pines?

464
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.386
Seems like a random stop

465
00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.971
for a professional
athlete like yourself.

466
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.556
- Family.
- Aw.

467
00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.891
Now that I have a
little bit more time

468
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.560
on my hands than usual.

469
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.686
How do you guys know each other?

470
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.646
Oh. Ian challenged me and Dion

471
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:13.231
to a race the first
day of kindergarten.

472
00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.066
and we have been
friends ever since.

473
00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.192
I thought you don't
care about winning.

474
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.986
Oh. he's all about
the competition.

475
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:20.739
Every jog-a-thon. he out
laps the rest of us by miles.

476
00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.699
practically refusing to stop.

477
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:23.867
They would be
taking in the cones.

478
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:24.743
and he'd still be running.

479
00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:25.910
Interesting.

480
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.162
It was for charity.

481
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:28.204
Lies!

482
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:29.914
You lived for it!

483
00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.708
And he always won too.

484
00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.668
He's one of those
annoyingly perfect humans

485
00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.587
that's just good at
everything they try.

486
00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:36.546
Yeah?

487
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.423
All right. enough from you.

488
00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.846
Who was the only woman

489
00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:47.599
to be officially
drafted by the NBA?

490
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:48.600
Oh. I feel like
I should know this.

491
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.601
Lucia Harris?

492
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:50.393
Oh.

493
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:53.897
Nice.

494
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.775
What team was she drafted by?

495
00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:58.693
- Uh...
- You know it.

496
00:21:58.693 --> 00:21:59.652
The New Orleans Jazz.

497
00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:03.281
- Okay!
- Go. go!

498
00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:07.744
Nice. good job.

499
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:14.292
All right. this is the
last question of the night.

500
00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:16.294
And the category is...

501
00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:18.380
Music of the 90s!

502
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.214
We totally got this.

503
00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:20.507
I strongly agree.

504
00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.050
They used to call Ian.
"The Human Jukebox".

505
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.802
Nice. And I'm freakishly
good at Name That Tune.

506
00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:26.429
So I say. we bet it all.

507
00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:27.305
Mm. mhm.

508
00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:28.264
No. that's too risky.

509
00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.474
We're already up by five.

510
00:22:29.474 --> 00:22:30.266
Why would we do that?

511
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:31.184
Exactly.

512
00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.729
The second team won't
be able to take the lead

513
00:22:34.729 --> 00:22:36.856
if we put it all in.

514
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:37.774
Go big or go home.

515
00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:41.820
Five. five. five. five.

516
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.154
Okay.

517
00:22:43.154 --> 00:22:47.409
In Meat Loaf's
1993 power ballad.

518
00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:50.453
"I'd Do Anything for Love
".

519
00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:52.539
what are the seven things
he won't do for love?

520
00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:55.917
Never lie to her.

521
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:58.420
Never forget how
she feels tonight.

522
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.006
Never forgive himself if
he doesn't go all the way.

523
00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:02.132
do it better-

524
00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:03.341
Than he does it with her!

525
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.718
Nice.

526
00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:06.761
Stop dreaming of her
every night of his life.

527
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:08.513
See that it's time to move on.

528
00:23:09.347 --> 00:23:10.348
That's six.

529
00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:11.725
Okay. Come on.

530
00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:12.642
Come on. you got this.
- Oh. okay. I got it.

531
00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:13.393
You know the 7th?

532
00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:14.519
Perfect.

533
00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.353
She's got it.

534
00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:16.187
Thank you.

535
00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:19.649
Okay. perfect.

536
00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.317
Oh. looks like we've got two
teams with correct answers.

537
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.069
So just give us a
second to tally here.

538
00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:28.950
Okay. so. team Nom-Nom-Nom
was in fourth place.

539
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.327
but you bet 20 points. so
that jumps you up to the lead.

540
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:33.163
Now. let's take a look and see-

541
00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:34.581
Sorry. guys.

542
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:37.584
What team Just For
Kicks wagered. it's...

543
00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.336
5 points.

544
00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:40.211
Team Nom-Nom-Nom!

545
00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:44.716
Here you go.

546
00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:47.385
You win some. you lose some.

547
00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:48.720
Hey. here's our nom. nom. nom!

548
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.637
Okay!

549
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.306
All right. these...

550
00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:52.223
These are why we play.

551
00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:53.224
They're amazing.

552
00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:54.893
The best wings in the world.

553
00:23:54.893 --> 00:23:56.644
I don't want
consolation wings.

554
00:23:56.644 --> 00:23:58.480
I want victory wings.

555
00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.230
You should've won.

556
00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:02.233
Winning isn't the point.

557
00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:05.528
Winning is always the point.

558
00:24:05.528 --> 00:24:07.197
Enjoy the wings.
Thanks for the game.

559
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.141
Did you see they're doing
Twelfth Night this year?

560
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.184
Anyone trying out?

561
00:24:36.184 --> 00:24:37.477
A hard pass.

562
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.480
You're the CEO
of being dramatic.

563
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.107
How are you not trying out?

564
00:24:42.107 --> 00:24:44.776
Um. because I'd rather
have a furry little hamster

565
00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.361
run across my belly
while I'm sleeping

566
00:24:46.361 --> 00:24:48.113
than get up in front
of other people

567
00:24:48.113 --> 00:24:50.115
and recite some
dead guy's lines.

568
00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:51.366
That was dramatic.

569
00:24:51.366 --> 00:24:54.119
See. you should
definitely try out.

570
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:56.955
I actually think it'd
be fun. I might audition.

571
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.873
Is that ridiculous?

572
00:24:58.873 --> 00:25:01.042
No. that's low key impressive.

573
00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:02.627
How can there not be
a single offensive drill

574
00:25:02.627 --> 00:25:04.295
in this entire practice?

575
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.715
This is your chance
at the quarter-finals.

576
00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:10.010
Do you think that I won three
World Cups by playing small?

577
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.345
Female athletes have
enough going against them.

578
00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:14.556
It is our job as coaches not to-

579
00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:15.515
Bingo.

580
00:25:15.515 --> 00:25:17.017
You're my assistant coach.

581
00:25:17.017 --> 00:25:18.685
So assist me.

582
00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:20.687
It's my team. Can
we try it my way?

583
00:25:20.687 --> 00:25:21.896
If we do things your way.

584
00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:23.064
they're gonna be holding hands.

585
00:25:23.064 --> 00:25:24.649
skipping down the field.

586
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:26.735
Oh. okay. That's a bit
dramatic. don't you think?

587
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:28.403
Speaking of drama.

588
00:25:28.403 --> 00:25:29.779
Sorry. ladies.

589
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:31.031
We were just having a
little disagreement.

590
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:32.949
trying to air out
our differences here.

591
00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:34.242
That's nothing.

592
00:25:34.242 --> 00:25:35.493
You should see how
mad my mom gets

593
00:25:35.493 --> 00:25:36.786
when my dad eats
all the ice cream.

594
00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:40.415
Let's do the
numbers drill. yeah?

595
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.543
Okay. come on.

596
00:25:43.543 --> 00:25:44.461
So excited.

597
00:25:46.463 --> 00:25:49.841
Can you please try and
get along with Coach?

598
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:50.759
We get along fine.

599
00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:53.136
We all heard you out there.

600
00:25:54.095 --> 00:25:55.055
How much did you hear?

601
00:25:55.055 --> 00:25:56.514
Enough.

602
00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:59.100
So you heard how he thinks

603
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.227
he knows more about
soccer than I do.

604
00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:03.396
I played with Jill Ellis.

605
00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:05.940
Okay. I think I know
more than he does

606
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.609
with my long and storied career

607
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.611
as a professional soccer player.

608
00:26:09.611 --> 00:26:14.240
Cucu. we all know
you can be a little...

609
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.617
How can I put this nicely?

610
00:26:15.617 --> 00:26:17.619
Super frickin' stubborn.

611
00:26:18.912 --> 00:26:21.373
Me? Stubborn?

612
00:26:21.373 --> 00:26:23.041
Yes!

613
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:25.168
And you know what my
best teachers never do?

614
00:26:25.168 --> 00:26:29.089
Go on and on about how
much better they are.

615
00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:31.466
Because their job is to teach.

616
00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:33.009
not to be right all the time.

617
00:26:35.428 --> 00:26:36.346
That was harsh.

618
00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:41.267
But you do have a point.

619
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:43.019
I promise to try to be better.

620
00:26:44.771 --> 00:26:45.647
Thank you.

621
00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:46.606
Now. can we get tacos?

622
00:26:46.606 --> 00:26:47.982
I'm starving.

623
00:26:47.982 --> 00:26:49.150
No. we're gonna go
have Chinese food.

624
00:26:50.902 --> 00:26:53.446
Tacos! Because I
am a team player.

625
00:26:54.447 --> 00:26:56.491
See. I can be a team player.

626
00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:00.620
Hey.

627
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.371
Oh. hey.

628
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:04.082
Thanks for coming.

629
00:27:04.082 --> 00:27:05.667
Oh. hey. no crutches.

630
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.335
Yeah. turns out
I'm a quick healer.

631
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:10.964
Thanks. Sandra.

632
00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:15.051
I don't think she likes me.

633
00:27:15.051 --> 00:27:17.679
I ordered a flat white
with oat the other day.

634
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.097
She wasn't havin' it.

635
00:27:19.097 --> 00:27:20.807
Let me tell you a
secret about Sandra.

636
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:22.183
She's a little rough
on the front end.

637
00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:23.393
but once you're in with her.

638
00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:24.853
you're like basically
a town local.

639
00:27:24.853 --> 00:27:26.688
So she's like a town bouncer.

640
00:27:26.688 --> 00:27:28.523
Yeah. she's kind of
like a town bouncer.

641
00:27:29.357 --> 00:27:30.191
Hang on.

642
00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:33.528
Oh. Miss Sandra.

643
00:27:33.528 --> 00:27:35.321
Can I get what we talked
about the other day?

644
00:27:39.993 --> 00:27:40.869
Thanks.
- Mhm.

645
00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:41.661
Yeah.

646
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:44.998
Were you just...

647
00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:46.374
Were you hiding?

648
00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:47.709
I wasn't hiding.
You were hiding.

649
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:49.127
Eh.

650
00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:50.211
Oh. How'd you get
the oat milk hook up?

651
00:27:51.546 --> 00:27:53.173
Is this some kind
of locals only.

652
00:27:53.173 --> 00:27:55.008
secret society kind of thing?

653
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:56.343
And how do I become a member?

654
00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:58.094
I do a little
consulting for the cafe.

655
00:27:58.094 --> 00:27:59.679
and I convinced
Sandra that carrying

656
00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:00.889
an alternative milk product

657
00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:03.058
would be financially
beneficial for her. so.

658
00:28:03.058 --> 00:28:04.976
Never pegged you
for a money guy.

659
00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:08.104
Mm. yeah. I don't really
like to think of it like that.

660
00:28:08.104 --> 00:28:09.689
I just. you know...

661
00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:13.318
I enjoy strengthening small
businesses financially.

662
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:15.695
It's just sort of doing my
part to help my community.

663
00:28:15.695 --> 00:28:17.739
That's actually
pretty admirable.

664
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:18.573
Yeah?

665
00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:19.991
Mm.

666
00:28:19.991 --> 00:28:20.992
And I'm glad you
see it that way.

667
00:28:20.992 --> 00:28:23.495
Speaking of business.

668
00:28:23.495 --> 00:28:27.582
it's come to my attention
that a certain someone. Ava.

669
00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:29.250
would like for us to get along.

670
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.877
Okay.

671
00:28:30.877 --> 00:28:34.047
I know that we have
different coaching strategies.

672
00:28:34.047 --> 00:28:35.340
but at the end of the day.

673
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.050
we want what's best
for the players.

674
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.927
Yeah. I couldn't agree more.

675
00:28:38.927 --> 00:28:40.303
So. what do you say

676
00:28:40.303 --> 00:28:43.682
we take a 13 year old's
advice and compromise.

677
00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:44.474
Wow.

678
00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:48.144
I mean. when you put it like
that. it hurts a little bit.

679
00:28:48.144 --> 00:28:50.730
But yes. we should
present the united front.

680
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.067
We cannot. absolutely cannot
be seen arguing again.

681
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:57.779
Well. a little
disagreement is healthy. no?

682
00:28:57.779 --> 00:28:59.155
Unless I missed a memo

683
00:28:59.155 --> 00:29:00.824
that you're the town
relationship expert.

684
00:29:03.827 --> 00:29:06.663
You have no idea about
my past relationships.

685
00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:09.457
Sorry.

686
00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:11.960
It was just a joke.

687
00:29:14.421 --> 00:29:15.171
Listen...

688
00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:19.134
I think I know how we can
both get what we want.

689
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:26.641
I tell you what.

690
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:30.103
I will give you 10 minutes
of defensive drills.

691
00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:32.313
if you give me lava field.

692
00:29:32.313 --> 00:29:33.273
Field is lava?

693
00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:35.483
Come on.

694
00:29:36.401 --> 00:29:37.152
We have a deal?

695
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:40.655
Done.

696
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.949
All right. good.

697
00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.993
Sandra. we are ready to feast.

698
00:29:44.993 --> 00:29:46.745
Yes.

699
00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:48.830
You gotta taste
these. they're amazing.

700
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.291
Just an egg white
spinach omelet for me.

701
00:29:51.291 --> 00:29:52.250
Training mode.

702
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.960
Oh.

703
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.128
Just a matter of time before
I get back on the field.

704
00:29:55.128 --> 00:29:56.129
I love that confidence.

705
00:29:56.129 --> 00:29:57.922
It's essential for a champion.

706
00:29:57.922 --> 00:29:59.966
But also. you know...

707
00:29:59.966 --> 00:30:03.428
I tell every client it's
essential to have a backup plan

708
00:30:03.428 --> 00:30:05.722
for any successful business.

709
00:30:05.722 --> 00:30:08.516
You know. that way you
avoid disappointment.

710
00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:10.185
Okay.

711
00:30:10.185 --> 00:30:12.062
But this is my career.
and not some diner.

712
00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:17.108
Life isn't about
mitigating disaster.

713
00:30:17.108 --> 00:30:18.693
It's about going
for what you want.

714
00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:21.988
Wow.

715
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:24.199
Okay.

716
00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:25.658
While I appreciate your input.

717
00:30:25.658 --> 00:30:27.160
I know what's best for me.

718
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.536
In that case...

719
00:30:28.536 --> 00:30:30.538
I don't wanna mess up
your training diet.

720
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.211
That's right. girls.

721
00:30:36.211 --> 00:30:37.045
That's right.

722
00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:41.549
Why do you keep
checking the stop watch?

723
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:44.386
This drill teaches communication
and teamwork skills.

724
00:30:44.386 --> 00:30:46.221
You know what else could
teach them how to communicate?

725
00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:47.222
By passing the ball.

726
00:30:50.809 --> 00:30:51.851
That's 10. Coach.

727
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:53.144
Okay. this is my whistle.

728
00:30:53.144 --> 00:30:54.187
This is the head coach whistle.

729
00:30:54.187 --> 00:30:55.772
and you agreed to this format.

730
00:30:55.772 --> 00:30:57.399
And you agreed to a
10 minute time limit.

731
00:30:57.399 --> 00:30:59.901
Besides. this exercise
isn't even soccer adjacent.

732
00:30:59.901 --> 00:31:01.194
Yeah. well. who's
got the whistle. huh?

733
00:31:01.194 --> 00:31:03.071
Head coach.

734
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:05.198
All right. box
drill. everybody!

735
00:31:05.198 --> 00:31:06.408
Grab a ball and hustle up.

736
00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:10.245
Okay.

737
00:31:21.798 --> 00:31:26.511
I pray you. tell me if this
be the lady of the house.

738
00:31:27.303 --> 00:31:28.638
for I never saw her.

739
00:31:28.638 --> 00:31:31.891
I would be loath to
cast away my speech...

740
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:33.768
Sorry.

741
00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:36.521
I should've knocked.

742
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:38.231
That was great. by the way.

743
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:39.357
Shakespeare?

744
00:31:39.357 --> 00:31:40.734
Mhm. yeah.

745
00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:42.235
Twelfth Night.

746
00:31:42.235 --> 00:31:45.572
Well. your dad's
pretty hungry.

747
00:31:45.572 --> 00:31:48.408
And you know how he gets when
his sugar dips down real low.

748
00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:50.118
- Hangry.
- Exactly.

749
00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:54.539
I'll be right now.

750
00:31:58.752 --> 00:32:00.420
So. how's training?

751
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.465
You know. I mean.
it's going pretty...

752
00:32:03.465 --> 00:32:05.091
We're not bickering in front
of the players anymore.

753
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:06.509
so that's good.

754
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:08.094
Just. it was going
good the way it was.

755
00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:09.387
Good?

756
00:32:09.387 --> 00:32:11.222
Wasn't your team like 0 and 10?

757
00:32:11.222 --> 00:32:12.223
Oh. that was last season.

758
00:32:12.223 --> 00:32:13.266
Oh. right.

759
00:32:13.266 --> 00:32:14.309
Well. what about the players?

760
00:32:14.309 --> 00:32:15.310
How do they feel?

761
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.102
Oh. they love it.

762
00:32:16.102 --> 00:32:17.437
Of course. they do.

763
00:32:17.437 --> 00:32:19.064
Imagine being 13
and being trained

764
00:32:19.064 --> 00:32:20.815
by a professional athlete.

765
00:32:20.815 --> 00:32:22.359
You know. we would've
lost our minds

766
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:25.070
if Beckham would've shown
up to one of our practices.

767
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.112
Yeah. all right.

768
00:32:26.112 --> 00:32:28.073
Point made. point made.

769
00:32:28.073 --> 00:32:31.868
Problem is. she is so difficult.

770
00:32:31.868 --> 00:32:33.286
All she cares about is winning.

771
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.290
Maybe she just
needs you to teach her

772
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.124
the value of teamwork.

773
00:32:38.124 --> 00:32:39.125
Okay.

774
00:32:40.877 --> 00:32:42.504
If a life and professional
sports couldn't teach her that.

775
00:32:42.504 --> 00:32:43.254
how can I?

776
00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:46.800
Oh. actually...

777
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.301
A couple of years ago.

778
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:50.595
I did a ropes course with
a few of my employees.

779
00:32:50.595 --> 00:32:52.389
It was a great bonding exercise.

780
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:54.182
I think you and Emily
should try that.

781
00:32:55.975 --> 00:32:57.560
Yeah. ropes.

782
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.978
Yeah.

783
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:00.397
It's pretty easy
too. A lot of fun.

784
00:33:05.318 --> 00:33:06.152
Hey.

785
00:33:07.112 --> 00:33:08.113
Oh. hey.

786
00:33:09.322 --> 00:33:10.615
Nice outfit.

787
00:33:10.615 --> 00:33:12.117
Look at us. It's
like we planned it.

788
00:33:12.117 --> 00:33:13.243
Meant to be.

789
00:33:13.243 --> 00:33:14.661
Yeah.

790
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:16.287
So. I don't know
where we're going yet.

791
00:33:16.287 --> 00:33:17.163
Can I guess?

792
00:33:17.163 --> 00:33:18.748
Yeah. you can guess.

793
00:33:18.748 --> 00:33:21.084
But you know. I'm gonna
cap it at three tries. so.

794
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:22.043
Deal.

795
00:33:22.043 --> 00:33:22.836
Minigolf.

796
00:33:22.836 --> 00:33:24.087
That's one.

797
00:33:24.087 --> 00:33:25.338
- Brewery.
- Two.

798
00:33:25.338 --> 00:33:26.339
Can you tell me if I'm warm?

799
00:33:26.339 --> 00:33:27.924
No. you're ice cold.

800
00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:28.967
We're not going
geocaching. are we?

801
00:33:28.967 --> 00:33:30.260
That's three.

802
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.344
That's a weird guess.
and you're done.

803
00:33:33.346 --> 00:33:34.431
Are people still
reading those things?

804
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:35.640
Oh.

805
00:33:36.349 --> 00:33:38.018
Funny.

806
00:33:38.018 --> 00:33:38.852
Hey. isn't that the
place you put an offer on

807
00:33:38.852 --> 00:33:40.270
a few years ago?

808
00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.146
Ah. it's
the place I almost

809
00:33:41.146 --> 00:33:42.522
put an offer on a few years ago.

810
00:33:42.522 --> 00:33:43.982
Right. yeah.

811
00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:46.026
Kind of big for
a consulting firm.

812
00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:47.527
Actually. I was
gonna turn this

813
00:33:47.527 --> 00:33:49.029
into a sports training center.

814
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:50.989
I was gonna keep the
soccer field just as it is.

815
00:33:50.989 --> 00:33:51.990
Then I was gonna blow it out.

816
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.324
put some other fields in.

817
00:33:53.324 --> 00:33:54.951
hot yoga room. climbing wall.

818
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:56.036
Wow.

819
00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:56.911
Cool.

820
00:33:56.911 --> 00:33:58.830
- Yeah.
- What happened?

821
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:59.539
You know...

822
00:34:01.207 --> 00:34:02.625
Life got in the way.

823
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:03.626
What? Is that it?

824
00:34:03.626 --> 00:34:04.252
That's all you're gonna give me?

825
00:34:05.337 --> 00:34:06.880
Okay. since you're asking.

826
00:34:08.256 --> 00:34:11.593
getting a divorce kinda
put a wrench in things.

827
00:34:11.593 --> 00:34:12.719
I did. I did ask.

828
00:34:14.012 --> 00:34:15.430
So. what now?

829
00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:18.266
Did you give it
any more thought?

830
00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:22.187
We're gonna be late.

831
00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:24.522
Come on.

832
00:34:24.522 --> 00:34:26.107
Uh. okay.

833
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.402
So. how did you get
into consulting?

834
00:34:29.402 --> 00:34:31.905
Oh. well. I helped
my best friend Dion

835
00:34:31.905 --> 00:34:33.907
restore an old.
rundown summer camp

836
00:34:33.907 --> 00:34:35.241
that we used to go to.

837
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:36.576
and he now uses it
for birthday parties

838
00:34:36.576 --> 00:34:38.578
and family reunions
and business.

839
00:34:38.578 --> 00:34:40.205
It's successful.

840
00:34:40.205 --> 00:34:41.873
Sounds fun.

841
00:34:41.873 --> 00:34:43.249
Okay. listen. Listen. lady.

842
00:34:43.249 --> 00:34:45.043
I may not be a
fancy soccer player

843
00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:46.378
who gets to travel
around the world.

844
00:34:46.378 --> 00:34:48.254
but numbers are predictable.

845
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:51.883
and I like helping people
in my own community

846
00:34:51.883 --> 00:34:53.426
build their small businesses.

847
00:34:53.426 --> 00:34:55.553
Don't you think it's ironic

848
00:34:55.553 --> 00:34:58.723
that you help other businesses
succeed and not your own?

849
00:34:59.557 --> 00:35:01.017
Okay. all right.

850
00:35:01.017 --> 00:35:02.686
You know what? Let's
get harnessed up.

851
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:03.728
Come on.

852
00:35:04.562 --> 00:35:05.313
You're funny.

853
00:35:08.608 --> 00:35:09.526
Oh.

854
00:35:09.526 --> 00:35:10.735
You're not kidding.

855
00:35:10.735 --> 00:35:11.861
Nah-uh.

856
00:35:11.861 --> 00:35:13.279
Yeah. no. I don't do heights.

857
00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:15.532
Oh. I'm a jerk.

858
00:35:15.532 --> 00:35:16.866
I didn't even think to ask

859
00:35:16.866 --> 00:35:18.284
if you were afraid
of heights or not.

860
00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:21.329
I'm not afraid.

861
00:35:21.329 --> 00:35:22.247
I was just kidding.

862
00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:22.997
Wait...

863
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:27.836
Last one there gets to run
an extra drill at practice!

864
00:35:28.753 --> 00:35:30.130
I'm confused.

865
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.132
So you are afraid
or you're not...

866
00:35:32.132 --> 00:35:34.259
Why is everything a
competition with this one?

867
00:35:36.261 --> 00:35:36.970
I win!

868
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:37.846
Howdy.

869
00:35:37.846 --> 00:35:38.638
- Hi.
- Hi.

870
00:35:38.638 --> 00:35:39.848
Hi.

871
00:35:39.848 --> 00:35:40.557
We have an
appointment. 1 o'clock.

872
00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:41.266
Under the name of Ian.

873
00:35:41.266 --> 00:35:42.267
- Ian.
- Yeah.

874
00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:43.893
Yeah. I got you right here.

875
00:35:43.893 --> 00:35:45.645
Gosh. I wish my partner
was into stuff like this.

876
00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:47.439
We're not a couple.

877
00:35:48.732 --> 00:35:49.983
Oh. well. props
to you for planning

878
00:35:49.983 --> 00:35:52.318
such an adventurous
first date then.

879
00:35:52.318 --> 00:35:53.987
We're not. We work together.

880
00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:55.655
Oh. well...

881
00:35:57.032 --> 00:35:58.950
1 in 10 couples do meet
in the workplace. so.

882
00:36:01.077 --> 00:36:02.495
All right. let's get
you sized up here.

883
00:36:02.495 --> 00:36:03.288
- It's not funny.
- It's funny.

884
00:36:03.288 --> 00:36:04.998
It's not funny.

885
00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:08.168
You know what?

886
00:36:08.168 --> 00:36:10.003
On second thought. maybe
the advanced course

887
00:36:10.003 --> 00:36:11.963
was a bit ambitious.

888
00:36:11.963 --> 00:36:13.673
Oh. no. This is
still the basic course.

889
00:36:13.673 --> 00:36:14.966
Basic.

890
00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:16.176
We do have a
kids course though.

891
00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:17.635
if this is too
much for you guys.

892
00:36:17.635 --> 00:36:19.846
You want to do
the kids course?

893
00:36:19.846 --> 00:36:21.473
No. I'm not a kid.

894
00:36:21.473 --> 00:36:22.390
I can do this.

895
00:36:23.808 --> 00:36:24.934
I'm ready.

896
00:36:27.687 --> 00:36:29.522
All right.

897
00:36:31.358 --> 00:36:32.192
Okay.

898
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:33.943
You good?

899
00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:34.986
Yeah.

900
00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:36.363
Let's do this thing.

901
00:36:36.363 --> 00:36:37.197
Yeah.

902
00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:38.698
Okay.

903
00:36:38.698 --> 00:36:39.991
Whenever you're ready.

904
00:36:49.918 --> 00:36:50.752
Is everything okay?

905
00:36:53.463 --> 00:36:54.255
Sorry.

906
00:36:57.175 --> 00:36:58.051
You got this.

907
00:37:07.894 --> 00:37:08.728
Emily.

908
00:37:09.729 --> 00:37:11.773
Hey. are you all right?

909
00:37:13.858 --> 00:37:16.236
Do you want to go back?
We'll turn around.

910
00:37:16.236 --> 00:37:17.070
No.

911
00:37:18.697 --> 00:37:20.740
I said I wanted to do
this. and I'm gonna do it.

912
00:37:22.242 --> 00:37:23.993
I just need you to
talk me through this.

913
00:37:23.993 --> 00:37:25.412
Okay. I can do that.

914
00:37:26.538 --> 00:37:27.706
Here's what I want you to do.

915
00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:29.124
I want you to look at me.

916
00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:33.044
and just follow the
sound of my voice.

917
00:37:33.044 --> 00:37:33.878
I can't.

918
00:37:33.878 --> 00:37:34.629
Yes. you can.

919
00:37:36.214 --> 00:37:37.382
Come here.

920
00:37:37.382 --> 00:37:38.925
No. you don't understand.

921
00:37:38.925 --> 00:37:40.760
I've been like
this my whole life.

922
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.345
I'm afraid of heights.

923
00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:44.347
I know it's irrational.
but I'm a rational person.

924
00:37:44.347 --> 00:37:45.265
I swear.

925
00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:46.182
It's just that I can't.

926
00:37:46.182 --> 00:37:47.017
No. I unders-

927
00:37:47.017 --> 00:37:48.143
My body won't do it.

928
00:37:48.143 --> 00:37:49.811
Listen. I get it.

929
00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:53.023
It might be rational.
but it's also scary.

930
00:37:53.023 --> 00:37:54.691
Yeah.

931
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:55.942
But you don't
have to be afraid.

932
00:37:55.942 --> 00:37:58.111
because you're not
doing it alone.

933
00:37:58.111 --> 00:38:00.030
I'm right here with you.

934
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.032
So just look at me.

935
00:38:02.032 --> 00:38:05.326
I just need you to
take three small steps.

936
00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:06.202
All right?

937
00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:07.912
Come on. look at me.

938
00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:08.788
There you go. Right here.

939
00:38:08.788 --> 00:38:09.664
It's perfect.

940
00:38:10.915 --> 00:38:12.417
You ready?

941
00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:13.168
First step.

942
00:38:15.253 --> 00:38:16.254
One. yup.

943
00:38:16.254 --> 00:38:17.255
Oh my gosh.

944
00:38:17.255 --> 00:38:18.298
It's great. It's great.

945
00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:21.760
Yeah. Yeah.

946
00:38:22.635 --> 00:38:23.470
All right. two.

947
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.431
You're so close.

948
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:27.265
All right.

949
00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:28.016
Last one.

950
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.186
I got you. I got you.

951
00:38:31.186 --> 00:38:33.146
Wait.

952
00:38:34.773 --> 00:38:36.191
You did it!

953
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:36.983
You did it.

954
00:38:36.983 --> 00:38:38.401
Woo!

955
00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:41.154
You guys really are
such a cute couple.

956
00:38:41.154 --> 00:38:43.073
We're not a couple!

957
00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:51.873
All right. let's go!

958
00:38:51.873 --> 00:38:53.124
Here we go!

959
00:39:02.509 --> 00:39:03.802
Yeah!

960
00:39:05.512 --> 00:39:06.596
Yes!

961
00:39:06.596 --> 00:39:07.430
You're our good luck charm!

962
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:08.515
No luck necessary.

963
00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:09.307
They worked really hard.

964
00:39:09.307 --> 00:39:10.725
They are winners!

965
00:39:10.725 --> 00:39:11.518
Which is what we want
to talk to you about.

966
00:39:11.518 --> 00:39:13.144
We think Emily should stay on.

967
00:39:13.144 --> 00:39:14.145
I agree.

968
00:39:14.145 --> 00:39:15.313
No. just hear me out. okay?

969
00:39:15.313 --> 00:39:16.606
If we win the semi-final.

970
00:39:16.606 --> 00:39:17.524
that means that we
go to the final.

971
00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:19.150
Amazing!

972
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.527
But you know what that
means for the team parents?

973
00:39:20.527 --> 00:39:23.571
It means I have to
reschedule six wine socials.

974
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:25.615
three book club meetings.
two Bunco games.

975
00:39:25.615 --> 00:39:28.284
and a PTA fundraiser.

976
00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:30.328
And I certainly don't wanna
go through all that work

977
00:39:30.328 --> 00:39:33.123
if the girls aren't getting
the training they need.

978
00:39:33.123 --> 00:39:34.124
Sheila. I think it's-

979
00:39:34.124 --> 00:39:35.208
Please. just one more thing!

980
00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:36.668
I think it's a great idea!

981
00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:38.420
I love it.

982
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.170
- What?
- Yeah.

983
00:39:40.046 --> 00:39:41.172
Yeah.

984
00:39:41.172 --> 00:39:42.048
- Really?
- Why not?

985
00:39:42.048 --> 00:39:43.383
Why mess with a good thing. huh?

986
00:39:43.383 --> 00:39:44.050
Okay. then yes!

987
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.051
I'd love to stay on!

988
00:39:47.012 --> 00:39:49.389
- Congrats. Dad.
- Yes! Yes!

989
00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:06.072
Well. look at that.

990
00:40:06.072 --> 00:40:07.365
Ha!

991
00:40:07.365 --> 00:40:08.908
You saw that. didn't you?

992
00:40:08.908 --> 00:40:10.410
Yeah. your secret's
safe with me.

993
00:40:12.037 --> 00:40:14.456
Now. if you want to try
some real dip. come here.

994
00:40:18.877 --> 00:40:23.381
Who brings a carved out
bread bowl to a team party?

995
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:27.135
There's probably a gross.
store-bought dip inside.

996
00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:28.386
Mm!

997
00:40:28.386 --> 00:40:30.597
This is amazing. Ian.

998
00:40:30.597 --> 00:40:33.266
Did you put homemade
tahini inside the hummus?

999
00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:35.518
I did. Sheila. Yes. I did.

1000
00:40:36.644 --> 00:40:37.645
I need this recipe.

1001
00:40:37.645 --> 00:40:38.480
I'll give it to you.

1002
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.647
Okay. deal.

1003
00:40:39.647 --> 00:40:40.857
What were you saying?

1004
00:40:40.857 --> 00:40:41.983
Nothing.

1005
00:40:41.983 --> 00:40:43.735
Oh. nothing.

1006
00:40:43.735 --> 00:40:45.862
You know. usually when
people lash out like that.

1007
00:40:45.862 --> 00:40:48.490
there was this unresolved
want underneath.

1008
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.658
Okay. Brene Brown.

1009
00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:53.036
Who's Brene? Who is that?

1010
00:40:53.036 --> 00:40:53.787
Who's he?

1011
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.706
What?

1012
00:40:56.706 --> 00:40:58.291
I never learned my
way around the kitchen

1013
00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:00.460
because of all the traveling.

1014
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.253
I'm more of a
takeout kind of gal.

1015
00:41:02.253 --> 00:41:05.131
That's why homemade tahini
leaves me a little jealous.

1016
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:06.341
Well. I could show
you a few things

1017
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:07.801
around the kitchen if you want.

1018
00:41:09.678 --> 00:41:11.096
I'll think about it.

1019
00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:12.597
It's time! It's time!

1020
00:41:12.597 --> 00:41:13.640
Ooh. it is time.

1021
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.600
All right. three-legged race.

1022
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.518
It's good for team building.

1023
00:41:16.518 --> 00:41:17.811
Come on.

1024
00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:18.895
- Your specialty.
- Come on.

1025
00:41:18.895 --> 00:41:19.729
Three. two. one!

1026
00:41:21.648 --> 00:41:22.565
Go!

1027
00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:23.441
Come on!

1028
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:24.359
Hurry up. hurry up.

1029
00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:25.402
We gotta go!

1030
00:41:25.402 --> 00:41:26.695
They're winning.
they're winning!

1031
00:41:26.695 --> 00:41:27.987
Hurry up. we're gonna...

1032
00:41:30.198 --> 00:41:31.991
We can still do it.
we can still win.

1033
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:34.369
Come on. come on. come on!

1034
00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:36.705
God. you're so slow!

1035
00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.997
What are we doing?

1036
00:41:37.997 --> 00:41:39.290
We're gonna win!

1037
00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:42.210
What are we doing?

1038
00:41:46.047 --> 00:41:48.049
We go this. come on!

1039
00:41:56.307 --> 00:41:58.268
And in some uplifting news.

1040
00:41:58.268 --> 00:42:00.645
Emily Chen coaches a
Washington youth soccer team

1041
00:42:00.645 --> 00:42:01.855
to the semi-finals.

1042
00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:03.606
Could this be a new Emily?

1043
00:42:03.606 --> 00:42:05.734
Well. there's some less
uplifting news as well.

1044
00:42:05.734 --> 00:42:08.445
The Premier continue
their losing streak.

1045
00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:10.947
Seems they can't find a win
without Chen carrying them.

1046
00:42:12.407 --> 00:42:13.783
So. what's holding you back?

1047
00:42:15.827 --> 00:42:17.162
I wanna audition.

1048
00:42:17.162 --> 00:42:17.954
I do.

1049
00:42:18.913 --> 00:42:20.582
But...

1050
00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:22.250
What if I get the part?

1051
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.419
That's normally a good thing.

1052
00:42:24.419 --> 00:42:25.962
Sure.

1053
00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:29.591
But if I get the part. I
won't be able to do OTP.

1054
00:42:29.591 --> 00:42:32.177
And if I don't get in
the extra training.

1055
00:42:32.177 --> 00:42:33.762
I'll never get a
college scholarship.

1056
00:42:33.762 --> 00:42:35.055
And if I don't play in college.

1057
00:42:35.055 --> 00:42:36.931
I'll never go pro
like you and mom.

1058
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:38.767
That's a lot of ifs.

1059
00:42:40.268 --> 00:42:45.065
I want you to know
that no matter what.

1060
00:42:45.065 --> 00:42:48.568
I'm always gonna be here to
support you. soccer or not.

1061
00:42:48.568 --> 00:42:50.236
And your mom.

1062
00:42:50.236 --> 00:42:52.155
she's gonna be happy with
whatever you decide to do.

1063
00:42:55.283 --> 00:42:56.659
My two cents...

1064
00:42:58.745 --> 00:42:59.496
Follow your heart.

1065
00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:01.998
What does it tell you?

1066
00:43:05.585 --> 00:43:06.753
I don't know.

1067
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.423
I love soccer.

1068
00:43:10.423 --> 00:43:12.801
There's just so many other
things I want to try.

1069
00:43:16.388 --> 00:43:17.305
Follow your heart.

1070
00:43:29.943 --> 00:43:31.611
Proud of you.

1071
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:33.863
All I did was write my name
down on a piece of paper.

1072
00:43:35.448 --> 00:43:36.825
I think it was a little
bit more than that.

1073
00:43:47.711 --> 00:43:49.546
- Hi!
- Whoa!

1074
00:43:49.546 --> 00:43:51.631
Gosh. What's with all
the physical affection?

1075
00:43:51.631 --> 00:43:53.258
I mean. I'm not complaining.
I'm here for it.

1076
00:43:53.258 --> 00:43:55.176
Seriously. thank you
so much for coming.

1077
00:43:55.176 --> 00:43:57.262
I can't wait to see
their reactions.

1078
00:43:57.262 --> 00:43:58.847
Here they come. Here they come.

1079
00:43:58.847 --> 00:44:00.348
You're Maya Fayad.

1080
00:44:00.348 --> 00:44:02.600
Hi. Hello.

1081
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.020
This is literally like
my biggest dream come true.

1082
00:44:05.854 --> 00:44:07.188
This is great.

1083
00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:07.981
Hey.

1084
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:08.898
Hi. Emily.

1085
00:44:08.898 --> 00:44:09.858
Who's your friend?

1086
00:44:09.858 --> 00:44:11.443
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1087
00:44:11.443 --> 00:44:12.277
I hope it's okay.

1088
00:44:12.277 --> 00:44:13.695
Yeah. no. of course.

1089
00:44:13.695 --> 00:44:14.487
A friend of Emily's is
a friend of the team.

1090
00:44:14.487 --> 00:44:15.697
Isn't that right. ladies?

1091
00:44:15.697 --> 00:44:16.823
Yes!

1092
00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:18.199
Awesome!

1093
00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:19.993
Well. who wants to
learn some new tricks?

1094
00:44:19.993 --> 00:44:20.869
Me!

1095
00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:22.120
Let's go that way.

1096
00:44:27.542 --> 00:44:28.710
Come on. come on. come on.

1097
00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:31.504
We got this.

1098
00:44:31.504 --> 00:44:33.048
We'll get 'em this time.

1099
00:44:33.048 --> 00:44:34.799
It's so cool that you're
coaching these kids.

1100
00:44:34.799 --> 00:44:36.176
Did you grow up playing?

1101
00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:37.344
Yeah. I played a little.

1102
00:44:37.344 --> 00:44:38.636
A little?

1103
00:44:38.636 --> 00:44:39.721
He was about to be
a Clemson Tiger.

1104
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:40.847
I didn't know that.

1105
00:44:40.847 --> 00:44:42.015
Injury?

1106
00:44:42.015 --> 00:44:43.475
Marriage.

1107
00:44:43.475 --> 00:44:44.893
Oops.

1108
00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:46.728
Yeah. I chose love
over a scholarship

1109
00:44:46.728 --> 00:44:47.979
to a ACC powerhouse.

1110
00:44:47.979 --> 00:44:49.189
But you know. no big deal.

1111
00:44:49.189 --> 00:44:51.191
Eh. it's kind of a big deal.

1112
00:44:51.191 --> 00:44:52.734
especially 'cause she left.

1113
00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:54.569
Thanks for that!

1114
00:44:54.569 --> 00:44:55.362
You know what? I made a choice.

1115
00:44:55.362 --> 00:44:57.030
I don't regret it.

1116
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.490
And I still have a little
bit of soccer in my life. so.

1117
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.158
You must have
been really good.

1118
00:45:00.158 --> 00:45:02.243
You seem surprised.

1119
00:45:02.243 --> 00:45:03.078
How about that!

1120
00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:06.539
That's what I'm talking about!

1121
00:45:06.539 --> 00:45:08.416
Winner buys the next round.

1122
00:45:08.416 --> 00:45:09.167
- Okay.
- All right.

1123
00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:10.085
Okay

1124
00:45:10.085 --> 00:45:11.586
Or we can just play.

1125
00:45:11.586 --> 00:45:12.879
You know. Maya. I
gotta thank you.

1126
00:45:12.879 --> 00:45:14.422
The girls have been so excited

1127
00:45:14.422 --> 00:45:16.883
to actually work with a
professional soccer player.

1128
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:17.926
Whoa. What?

1129
00:45:18.927 --> 00:45:20.095
What about me?

1130
00:45:22.597 --> 00:45:23.390
Oh!

1131
00:45:24.641 --> 00:45:26.434
You said winner
buys the next round.

1132
00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:27.769
That's us.

1133
00:45:27.769 --> 00:45:29.104
You know what?
You're our guest.

1134
00:45:29.104 --> 00:45:30.146
Yeah. we'll get it.

1135
00:45:30.146 --> 00:45:31.773
Aw.

1136
00:45:31.773 --> 00:45:33.566
Hey. I gotta say. you
took that loss really well.

1137
00:45:33.566 --> 00:45:38.321
Well. someone taught me
that it's okay to just play.

1138
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:40.448
Yeah?

1139
00:45:40.448 --> 00:45:42.450
That person sounds
mature and wise.

1140
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.285
And very good looking.

1141
00:45:48.832 --> 00:45:50.083
So. how are you?

1142
00:45:50.083 --> 00:45:51.626
Better.

1143
00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:53.712
This town's really
growing on me.

1144
00:45:53.712 --> 00:45:55.380
Enough to stay?

1145
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.673
Let's not get carried away.

1146
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:59.134
Good.

1147
00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:01.761
Because I think Coach
Avila might bring you back.

1148
00:46:01.761 --> 00:46:03.096
Really?

1149
00:46:20.196 --> 00:46:22.949
Would you like me to go in
with you for moral support?

1150
00:46:22.949 --> 00:46:25.160
Parents aren't
allowed. thankfully.

1151
00:46:28.371 --> 00:46:30.290
Okay. I'll be right
here when you're done.

1152
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.500
Oh. I'm sure you will be.

1153
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.335
Team Chen!

1154
00:46:34.169 --> 00:46:35.003
Okay.

1155
00:46:38.423 --> 00:46:39.341
Oh.

1156
00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:40.258
Hey.

1157
00:46:40.258 --> 00:46:41.176
Here to audition?

1158
00:46:42.594 --> 00:46:44.804
No. Actually. I'm
here to see Sandra.

1159
00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:45.638
How about you?

1160
00:46:45.638 --> 00:46:46.973
Why are you here?

1161
00:46:46.973 --> 00:46:47.682
Ava's trying out
for Twelfth Night!

1162
00:46:47.682 --> 00:46:48.975
Oh. she is?

1163
00:46:48.975 --> 00:46:50.518
That's cool. She inside already?

1164
00:46:50.518 --> 00:46:52.187
I don't know.
I'm not allowed in.

1165
00:46:52.187 --> 00:46:53.938
Yeah. I know.

1166
00:46:53.938 --> 00:46:56.191
There was a local stage mom
who ruined it for everybody.

1167
00:46:56.191 --> 00:46:57.942
Who?

1168
00:46:57.942 --> 00:46:59.861
Eh. I don't know
if I should tell you.

1169
00:46:59.861 --> 00:47:01.029
Sheila.

1170
00:47:02.322 --> 00:47:03.948
Well. it's fine.

1171
00:47:03.948 --> 00:47:05.533
I should probably respect
that and give her space.

1172
00:47:05.533 --> 00:47:06.785
Yeah.

1173
00:47:06.785 --> 00:47:09.871
You could do that.

1174
00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:10.663
Or...

1175
00:47:11.873 --> 00:47:12.832
Ooh.

1176
00:47:12.832 --> 00:47:13.750
Come here.

1177
00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:19.631
Can you see her?

1178
00:47:19.631 --> 00:47:20.423
No.

1179
00:47:22.133 --> 00:47:23.677
Oh. yes!

1180
00:47:23.677 --> 00:47:25.011
I see her!

1181
00:47:25.011 --> 00:47:26.805
Yeah. What is she doing?

1182
00:47:26.805 --> 00:47:28.223
She's walking on stage.

1183
00:47:29.557 --> 00:47:31.101
She looks so confident.

1184
00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:34.688
Exquisite and unmatchable
beauty. I pray you!

1185
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.774
The director's clapping.

1186
00:47:39.693 --> 00:47:40.819
She's smiling.

1187
00:47:40.819 --> 00:47:42.404
Yeah.

1188
00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:49.828
Let's show them
what we're made of!

1189
00:47:49.828 --> 00:47:50.662
Lower! That's good!

1190
00:47:50.662 --> 00:47:51.246
Shuffle. shuffle.

1191
00:47:51.246 --> 00:47:52.122
Side shuffle.

1192
00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:52.747
That's good. South.

1193
00:47:52.747 --> 00:47:53.873
Good. Spencer.

1194
00:47:53.873 --> 00:47:54.874
Good hustle. Good hustle.

1195
00:47:54.874 --> 00:47:55.917
That's it. Darr.

1196
00:47:56.918 --> 00:47:59.045
Going lower. Chen. going lower.

1197
00:47:59.045 --> 00:48:00.213
Yes. yes. yes. yes.

1198
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:02.382
- All right.
- All right. everybody.

1199
00:48:02.382 --> 00:48:03.216
Good job. ladies.

1200
00:48:03.216 --> 00:48:04.050
Good job.

1201
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:04.926
Bring it in.

1202
00:48:04.926 --> 00:48:05.719
Circle up. circle up.

1203
00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:06.469
All right.

1204
00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:09.889
Wonderful. Great.

1205
00:48:09.889 --> 00:48:11.391
We are taking the
rest of the week off.

1206
00:48:11.391 --> 00:48:13.643
We have no more practice.

1207
00:48:13.643 --> 00:48:15.687
I want you to eat good
food. not junk food.

1208
00:48:15.687 --> 00:48:17.063
Don't stay up late
watching TikTok

1209
00:48:17.063 --> 00:48:18.606
and doing whatever you guys do.

1210
00:48:18.606 --> 00:48:21.901
because we gotta get
ready for the semi-finals.

1211
00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:23.111
Yeah!

1212
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:23.945
Who are we?

1213
00:48:25.447 --> 00:48:27.240
Purple Thunder!

1214
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:29.075
Great practice.

1215
00:48:29.075 --> 00:48:30.118
Good practice.

1216
00:48:31.327 --> 00:48:32.287
Whew.

1217
00:48:32.287 --> 00:48:34.080
Whoa. hang on.

1218
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.498
Is that you?

1219
00:48:35.498 --> 00:48:37.417
Oh. I think that was
a bobcat that snarled.

1220
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.462
Yeah. that was me.

1221
00:48:40.462 --> 00:48:42.881
I could use a bread
bowl right about now.

1222
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:44.007
Thanks for asking.

1223
00:48:45.091 --> 00:48:46.426
You're hungry?

1224
00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:48.636
You know. tonight
would be a good night

1225
00:48:48.636 --> 00:48:49.971
for a cooking lesson.

1226
00:48:52.182 --> 00:48:53.141
- All right.
- Yeah?

1227
00:48:53.141 --> 00:48:53.975
See you later.

1228
00:49:01.816 --> 00:49:04.444
So basically. we're
making a fancy pizza?

1229
00:49:04.444 --> 00:49:05.445
Ah-ah. no.

1230
00:49:05.445 --> 00:49:07.781
It's mushroom ricotta galette.

1231
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:08.573
It's French.

1232
00:49:08.573 --> 00:49:09.908
Mm.

1233
00:49:09.908 --> 00:49:10.992
Dough.

1234
00:49:10.992 --> 00:49:12.077
Cheese.

1235
00:49:12.077 --> 00:49:13.453
Sauce.

1236
00:49:13.453 --> 00:49:14.412
That's a pizza.

1237
00:49:14.412 --> 00:49:15.997
It is a pizza. isn't it?

1238
00:49:16.956 --> 00:49:18.375
Yeah. but you know.

1239
00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:20.126
and it's the best pizza
that you'll ever taste.

1240
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:21.169
I'll be the judge of that.

1241
00:49:21.169 --> 00:49:22.003
Yeah? You?

1242
00:49:22.003 --> 00:49:23.129
Quick to judge?

1243
00:49:23.129 --> 00:49:23.963
Imagine that.

1244
00:49:23.963 --> 00:49:24.964
Judging me. judge.

1245
00:49:26.341 --> 00:49:27.717
So. how'd you
get into cooking?

1246
00:49:29.052 --> 00:49:30.387
Tell you what. I'm
gonna cut mushrooms.

1247
00:49:30.387 --> 00:49:31.888
You shred cheese. and I
will tell you the story

1248
00:49:31.888 --> 00:49:34.307
about when my ex-wife
was in medical school.

1249
00:49:34.307 --> 00:49:36.184
and I was home a lot alone

1250
00:49:36.184 --> 00:49:38.103
in the early years
of our marriage.

1251
00:49:38.103 --> 00:49:39.938
And in order to keep
myself entertained

1252
00:49:39.938 --> 00:49:41.690
and a lot less lonely.

1253
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.358
I started watching
the Cooking Channel.

1254
00:49:43.358 --> 00:49:46.111
And I don't know. I
started challenging myself

1255
00:49:46.111 --> 00:49:47.320
while making more
elaborate meals.

1256
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.114
and it sort of became a hobby.

1257
00:49:49.114 --> 00:49:49.864
What's a hobby?

1258
00:49:51.282 --> 00:49:52.826
Okay. I know you're joking.

1259
00:49:52.826 --> 00:49:53.993
but you know. I haven't
heard you talk about anything

1260
00:49:53.993 --> 00:49:55.662
that lights you up
other than soccer.

1261
00:49:55.662 --> 00:49:58.748
Truthfully. I don't even know.

1262
00:49:58.748 --> 00:50:01.001
Soccer has been my life
for the last 20 years.

1263
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:02.961
If I'm not playing or training.

1264
00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:05.088
then I'm watching and analyzing.

1265
00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:06.840
I didn't realize how sad
it was until recently.

1266
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.008
Yeah. it's sad.

1267
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:08.842
It's very sad.

1268
00:50:08.842 --> 00:50:09.926
It's sad indeed.

1269
00:50:09.926 --> 00:50:11.302
Judgey McJudgey.

1270
00:50:11.302 --> 00:50:12.178
Ah.

1271
00:50:14.014 --> 00:50:17.142
Actually. when Ava said
that she was gonna audition.

1272
00:50:17.142 --> 00:50:18.393
I was kind of relieved.

1273
00:50:19.811 --> 00:50:21.855
I never got to be
a kid or have fun.

1274
00:50:21.855 --> 00:50:23.064
I don't want that for her.

1275
00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:25.442
I missed out on a lot.

1276
00:50:26.484 --> 00:50:27.777
Yeah? Like what?

1277
00:50:27.777 --> 00:50:32.240
Like pinewood derby
races in summer camp.

1278
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.783
Okay. that's oddly specific.

1279
00:50:33.783 --> 00:50:36.578
And that trip to the
water slide in eighth grade.

1280
00:50:36.578 --> 00:50:37.704
Actually. no.

1281
00:50:37.704 --> 00:50:38.580
I don't think so.

1282
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.914
Everybody got norovirus.

1283
00:50:39.914 --> 00:50:41.958
Ew. Hopefully not
on the water slides.

1284
00:50:41.958 --> 00:50:43.918
I never got to paper mâche

1285
00:50:43.918 --> 00:50:48.798
those ridiculous giant
floats for homecoming.

1286
00:50:48.798 --> 00:50:50.425
Given this a lot of
thought. haven't you?

1287
00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:51.885
Free time will do that to you.

1288
00:50:53.428 --> 00:50:55.055
Anyway. enough about me.

1289
00:50:55.055 --> 00:50:56.431
What about you?

1290
00:50:56.431 --> 00:50:57.557
How'd you end up
in Southern Pines?

1291
00:50:57.557 --> 00:51:00.769
Well. Southern
Pines is my hometown.

1292
00:51:00.769 --> 00:51:02.604
I love it here.

1293
00:51:02.604 --> 00:51:05.940
So after medical school. we
moved back. and then she left.

1294
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:09.194
Why?

1295
00:51:09.194 --> 00:51:10.653
Um...

1296
00:51:10.653 --> 00:51:12.238
Small town.

1297
00:51:12.238 --> 00:51:13.281
Glass ceiling.

1298
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.284
She had huge dreams.

1299
00:51:16.284 --> 00:51:18.328
She wanted a big
city. so she left.

1300
00:51:20.288 --> 00:51:21.664
You didn't wanna go with her?

1301
00:51:21.664 --> 00:51:22.957
No. I would've loved
to have gone with her.

1302
00:51:22.957 --> 00:51:24.626
but she had this theory

1303
00:51:24.626 --> 00:51:28.088
that she could either be a
great doctor or a great wife.

1304
00:51:28.088 --> 00:51:29.381
but not both.

1305
00:51:29.381 --> 00:51:33.385
So. you know. she left.

1306
00:51:33.385 --> 00:51:34.678
And God speed to her.

1307
00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:36.680
She's an amazing doctor
and it gives her joy.

1308
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.599
and I am happy for her.
but that wasn't for me.

1309
00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:40.433
You know?

1310
00:51:40.433 --> 00:51:41.643
I love it here.

1311
00:51:41.643 --> 00:51:42.644
It's my home.

1312
00:51:42.644 --> 00:51:43.561
This is where I live.

1313
00:51:43.561 --> 00:51:44.646
I'm never gonna leave.

1314
00:51:46.231 --> 00:51:47.148
Why?

1315
00:51:47.148 --> 00:51:48.942
Okay.

1316
00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:53.321
I could tell you why. but I
think I'd rather show you.

1317
00:51:55.323 --> 00:51:59.160
Mm.

1318
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.412
It's
beautiful. isn't it?

1319
00:52:00.412 --> 00:52:01.830
Wow.

1320
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.290
How have I never
seen this before?

1321
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.668
I guess I'm just not in
town as much as I should be.

1322
00:52:08.128 --> 00:52:11.047
Now. is that just
the traveling or...

1323
00:52:11.047 --> 00:52:14.884
Yeah. and I've kind of
been avoiding this place

1324
00:52:14.884 --> 00:52:17.012
ever since Ava's mom.
Caroline. passed away.

1325
00:52:17.012 --> 00:52:18.346
Okay.

1326
00:52:18.346 --> 00:52:19.764
Like. I know that she's
not in the picture.

1327
00:52:19.764 --> 00:52:21.474
but I never wanted to pry.

1328
00:52:21.474 --> 00:52:22.225
Cancer.

1329
00:52:23.518 --> 00:52:24.602
That's awful.

1330
00:52:24.602 --> 00:52:26.146
Yeah.

1331
00:52:26.146 --> 00:52:26.896
It sucks.

1332
00:52:27.939 --> 00:52:30.859
Were you guys close?

1333
00:52:30.859 --> 00:52:32.485
Actually. she
was my best friend.

1334
00:52:33.987 --> 00:52:36.698
I was the one that
introduced her to Brandon.

1335
00:52:36.698 --> 00:52:38.742
We played soccer together at 1C.

1336
00:52:38.742 --> 00:52:42.162
and we both got picked
up with the Triumphs.

1337
00:52:43.455 --> 00:52:46.499
When she passed away.
I kind of lost it.

1338
00:52:46.499 --> 00:52:47.417
like with the team.

1339
00:52:49.377 --> 00:52:52.630
Played in Europe for
a few years and...

1340
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.883
Anything. really. to avoid it.

1341
00:52:54.883 --> 00:52:56.634
Yeah.

1342
00:52:56.634 --> 00:52:58.887
But that's not how
grief works. is it?

1343
00:52:58.887 --> 00:53:00.180
Yeah. that's
what I'm realizing.

1344
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.515
And I'm also learning
that it's better

1345
00:53:02.515 --> 00:53:03.933
to spend time with
the ones you love

1346
00:53:03.933 --> 00:53:06.394
than to avoid the pain
of the ones you've lost.

1347
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:10.023
Yeah.

1348
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:13.902
I know something about
trying to avoid the pain.

1349
00:53:16.946 --> 00:53:18.323
All right.

1350
00:53:18.323 --> 00:53:20.325
This is why I brought you here.

1351
00:53:20.325 --> 00:53:21.701
Okay.

1352
00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:22.535
So. you're gonna
lay on this table.

1353
00:53:22.535 --> 00:53:23.411
I know. you gotta trust me.

1354
00:53:23.411 --> 00:53:24.287
Mhm.

1355
00:53:24.287 --> 00:53:25.080
Lay down.

1356
00:53:26.915 --> 00:53:27.916
And...

1357
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.752
Behold.

1358
00:53:30.752 --> 00:53:32.379
Wow.

1359
00:53:32.379 --> 00:53:33.880
It's pretty. isn't it?

1360
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.090
Oh my gosh.

1361
00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:36.049
It's beautiful.

1362
00:53:37.467 --> 00:53:40.428
You know. you spoke
about avoiding the pain

1363
00:53:40.428 --> 00:53:41.763
of the ones you're lost.

1364
00:53:44.516 --> 00:53:48.436
Well. I have been avoiding
myself after my divorce.

1365
00:53:53.608 --> 00:53:55.819
I feel like. I guess.

1366
00:53:55.819 --> 00:53:59.072
having failed at the one thing
was supposed to last forever.

1367
00:53:59.072 --> 00:54:00.573
I'm just. I don't know...

1368
00:54:02.909 --> 00:54:04.119
I'm afraid to try anything.

1369
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.164
Is that why you gave up
on your sports complex?

1370
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:12.919
I mean. you help
businesses every day.

1371
00:54:12.919 --> 00:54:14.796
There's no one more
qualified than you.

1372
00:54:16.548 --> 00:54:17.799
Thank you for saying that.

1373
00:54:20.468 --> 00:54:22.137
I mean. you have to remember.

1374
00:54:22.137 --> 00:54:25.557
you can just as easily fail
in something you don't want.

1375
00:54:25.557 --> 00:54:27.559
as in something you want.

1376
00:54:29.769 --> 00:54:31.438
That is a terrifying thought.

1377
00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:32.772
Thank you for that.

1378
00:54:35.316 --> 00:54:36.901
I'm confused.

1379
00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:38.361
What about?

1380
00:54:38.361 --> 00:54:41.823
You live in Southern
Pines for the stars?

1381
00:54:41.823 --> 00:54:42.657
No.

1382
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.329
I live in Southern Pines for
the feeling that I have here.

1383
00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:01.176
I feel it too.

1384
00:55:23.323 --> 00:55:24.491
Oh. I got the part!

1385
00:55:25.367 --> 00:55:26.159
Congratulations!

1386
00:55:27.786 --> 00:55:29.913
Congratulations! Oh my gosh!

1387
00:55:29.913 --> 00:55:31.247
I thought you were training!

1388
00:55:31.247 --> 00:55:32.248
She's a sneaky one.

1389
00:55:32.248 --> 00:55:33.500
I'm so proud of you.

1390
00:55:35.126 --> 00:55:37.087
Team Chen!

1391
00:55:41.841 --> 00:55:43.677
How was your first rehearsal?

1392
00:55:43.677 --> 00:55:44.511
Good.

1393
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.555
It's so much
different than soccer.

1394
00:55:49.182 --> 00:55:50.016
What's wrong?

1395
00:55:50.975 --> 00:55:51.851
I'm excited.

1396
00:55:52.852 --> 00:55:54.145
I really am.

1397
00:55:55.772 --> 00:55:59.234
But I also feel guilty.

1398
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:03.655
Like. I'm not gonna be following
in my mama's footsteps.

1399
00:56:04.989 --> 00:56:07.117
Or yours.

1400
00:56:07.117 --> 00:56:10.453
Ava. I'm so sorry.

1401
00:56:10.453 --> 00:56:12.831
Hey. I didn't mean to put
all this pressure on you.

1402
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:13.915
Your mom...

1403
00:56:16.167 --> 00:56:18.211
Would've been thrilled for you.

1404
00:56:21.965 --> 00:56:23.717
You sure you're
not disappointed?

1405
00:56:24.718 --> 00:56:26.177
Never.

1406
00:56:44.195 --> 00:56:45.613
Ah. right there.

1407
00:56:50.577 --> 00:56:51.911
Pinewood derby carts.

1408
00:56:53.705 --> 00:56:57.375
I figured since you didn't
get to make these as a kid.

1409
00:56:57.375 --> 00:56:58.877
we can just make
some of our own.

1410
00:57:01.546 --> 00:57:02.922
I can't believe
you did all this.

1411
00:57:12.265 --> 00:57:13.850
Can I ask you something?

1412
00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:14.642
Yeah.

1413
00:57:15.852 --> 00:57:17.145
Humility aside...

1414
00:57:18.563 --> 00:57:21.066
I'm a gold mine of
advice for your players.

1415
00:57:22.442 --> 00:57:24.319
How come you never ask
me about my career?

1416
00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.904
Because I don't wanna
treat you differently

1417
00:57:25.904 --> 00:57:29.449
because you're this amazing.
famous soccer player.

1418
00:57:29.449 --> 00:57:32.619
Trust me. I know how
impressive your resume is.

1419
00:57:32.619 --> 00:57:36.581
but I like to evaluate people
based on their personalities.

1420
00:57:36.581 --> 00:57:38.208
not their accomplishments.

1421
00:57:38.208 --> 00:57:39.459
You think I'm amazing?

1422
00:57:41.628 --> 00:57:42.462
Yeah.

1423
00:57:44.047 --> 00:57:46.966
I think that that's pretty
amazing. number one.

1424
00:57:46.966 --> 00:57:50.053
I channeled eight
year old Emily.

1425
00:57:50.053 --> 00:57:51.971
and this is what
she's always wanted.

1426
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:53.640
Well. she got what she wanted.

1427
00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.058
Yeah.

1428
00:57:55.058 --> 00:57:56.601
But can you hold
onto the title?

1429
00:57:56.601 --> 00:57:57.477
Oh. yeah.

1430
00:57:57.477 --> 00:57:58.311
Are you ready to lose?

1431
00:57:58.311 --> 00:58:00.063
Oh!

1432
00:58:00.063 --> 00:58:03.483
All right. you put your
racer right on the track.

1433
00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:05.318
Just like that. okay?

1434
00:58:05.318 --> 00:58:06.111
Okay.

1435
00:58:07.362 --> 00:58:08.279
On your marks...

1436
00:58:09.364 --> 00:58:10.615
Get set...

1437
00:58:10.615 --> 00:58:11.700
- Hey.
- What?

1438
00:58:13.034 --> 00:58:15.161
Win or lose. today's
been really special.

1439
00:58:17.414 --> 00:58:18.832
I don't think anyone's
ever done something

1440
00:58:18.832 --> 00:58:20.375
this thoughtful to me before.

1441
00:58:22.335 --> 00:58:23.294
Well. you're welcome.

1442
00:58:23.294 --> 00:58:24.337
Okay. go!

1443
00:58:24.337 --> 00:58:26.506
Hey. wait a minute!

1444
00:58:26.506 --> 00:58:27.507
Yay!

1445
00:58:27.507 --> 00:58:28.591
I won!

1446
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:29.968
Yeah. of course you won.

1447
00:58:29.968 --> 00:58:32.095
You cheated.

1448
00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:33.430
You want some pancakes?

1449
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:34.305
Yeah!

1450
00:58:34.305 --> 00:58:35.056
Come on.

1451
00:58:36.433 --> 00:58:37.475
All right. your pancake's up.

1452
00:58:37.475 --> 00:58:38.268
You ready for it?

1453
00:58:38.268 --> 00:58:39.060
Okay.

1454
00:58:40.311 --> 00:58:41.771
Good. Okay.

1455
00:58:41.771 --> 00:58:43.023
You want some syrup?

1456
00:58:43.023 --> 00:58:44.315
Mhm.

1457
00:58:44.315 --> 00:58:45.525
Mm. Okay.

1458
00:58:46.526 --> 00:58:47.360
Thank you.

1459
00:58:49.529 --> 00:58:50.947
You're right.

1460
00:58:50.947 --> 00:58:52.032
This is the only way
to have pancakes.

1461
00:58:52.032 --> 00:58:52.866
Mm.

1462
00:58:55.785 --> 00:58:56.870
What do you think?
- Mm.

1463
00:59:00.165 --> 00:59:00.999
You have a gift.

1464
00:59:02.417 --> 00:59:03.668
All right. don't say
things you don't mean.

1465
00:59:03.668 --> 00:59:04.502
Seriously.

1466
00:59:07.839 --> 00:59:08.923
What's that look?

1467
00:59:11.468 --> 00:59:16.181
This is the look
of me thinking you
should stick around.

1468
00:59:17.474 --> 00:59:18.975
Stick around in
Southern Pines?

1469
00:59:18.975 --> 00:59:21.061
Southern Pines.
for the team...

1470
00:59:24.147 --> 00:59:25.857
Me.

1471
00:59:37.577 --> 00:59:38.411
Um...

1472
00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:45.210
I guess we should go. huh?

1473
00:59:47.045 --> 00:59:48.046
Yeah. yeah.

1474
00:59:48.046 --> 00:59:49.756
We should.

1475
01:00:23.581 --> 01:00:24.874
We won!

1476
01:00:29.462 --> 01:00:30.672
Purple Thunder!

1477
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.761
We're going to the championship!

1478
01:00:36.761 --> 01:00:38.013
That's my girls!

1479
01:00:42.017 --> 01:00:43.560
Hey. Emily.

1480
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.894
Hey.

1481
01:00:44.894 --> 01:00:46.271
What are you...

1482
01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:48.106
What are you doing later?

1483
01:00:48.106 --> 01:00:49.315
Wanna go over strategy?

1484
01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:52.360
I was thinking we could
shelve the soccer talk

1485
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.404
and I don't know. get
out of these clothes.

1486
01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:55.947
You're being super vague.

1487
01:00:55.947 --> 01:00:58.992
A date. I'm asking you
out on a proper date.

1488
01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:01.661
Well. technically. we've
been out a bunch already.

1489
01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:02.620
No. I know. but I'm thinking

1490
01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.997
it's time we make it official.

1491
01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:05.331
Like. an official date.

1492
01:01:06.332 --> 01:01:07.167
I'd love to.

1493
01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.501
Yeah?

1494
01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:09.711
I know an incredible tapas-
- I'm in.

1495
01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:15.258
I'll pick you up at 5 o'clock.

1496
01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:16.301
Okay.

1497
01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:18.011
Bye.

1498
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:27.562
Okay.

1499
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:29.481
Ooh!

1500
01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:30.899
Was that Coach Ian?

1501
01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:33.860
You're half right.

1502
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.236
Coach Avila.

1503
01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:38.531
Does she want you
back on the team?

1504
01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:40.200
That could be a possibility.

1505
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.534
Mhm.

1506
01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:45.872
How would you feel about that?

1507
01:01:45.872 --> 01:01:50.210
I'm gonna tell you what
my wise aunt told me.

1508
01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:53.254
I'm gonna be here for
you. no matter what.

1509
01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:56.383
Oh...

1510
01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:58.343
Whatever it is I
decide. I promise.

1511
01:01:58.343 --> 01:01:59.678
we're gonna see
more of each other.

1512
01:01:59.678 --> 01:02:01.388
I know.

1513
01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:03.306
And I'll be here
for the championships.

1514
01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:04.307
Deal?

1515
01:02:04.307 --> 01:02:05.642
Deal.

1516
01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:07.686
Wow. look at this.

1517
01:02:07.686 --> 01:02:08.436
I know.

1518
01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:11.648
Are you ready for tonight?

1519
01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:13.066
Oh. I got this.

1520
01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.401
Yeah. you were born ready.

1521
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:15.276
Team Chen.

1522
01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:16.319
Team Chen!

1523
01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:17.570
Yeah!

1524
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:18.655
Oh. can I help you with that?

1525
01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:19.447
Oh.

1526
01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:22.534
I'm Emily.

1527
01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:23.868
I don't think we've
officially met.

1528
01:02:23.868 --> 01:02:25.078
Yeah. Ava's aunt. right?

1529
01:02:25.078 --> 01:02:26.246
That's right.

1530
01:02:26.246 --> 01:02:27.539
Mhm.

1531
01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:29.124
You can just put
that over there.

1532
01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.002
Can I help you
with anything else?

1533
01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:34.629
Not unless you
wanna paint sets.

1534
01:02:34.629 --> 01:02:37.841
I'm no Picasso. but if
you need help. I'm in.

1535
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:40.051
And I could recruit others too.

1536
01:02:44.597 --> 01:02:46.266
Thank you.

1537
01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:47.517
Yeah.

1538
01:02:47.517 --> 01:02:48.476
Come right this way.

1539
01:02:50.603 --> 01:02:52.814
Uh. we're outta paint.

1540
01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:53.606
Oh. I'll get it.

1541
01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:54.691
Yeah? You don't mind?

1542
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:55.984
Mhm.

1543
01:02:55.984 --> 01:02:57.152
Hi. Sandra.

1544
01:02:57.152 --> 01:02:58.278
We need more paint.

1545
01:02:58.278 --> 01:02:59.696
Hey!

1546
01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:00.905
That is a very good
looking painting outfit

1547
01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:01.781
you have on there.
- Thank you.

1548
01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:03.324
Mhm. And I love the heels.

1549
01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:06.036
Yeah. it's really easy
to paint with heels on.

1550
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:09.164
Wow.

1551
01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:12.667
Someone's not so much
the outsider anymore.

1552
01:03:12.667 --> 01:03:14.294
It's really nice to be
part of the community.

1553
01:03:14.294 --> 01:03:16.963
Yeah. pretty soon you'll
be running for mayor.

1554
01:03:17.797 --> 01:03:19.341
Okay.

1555
01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:20.383
Cheers.

1556
01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:21.301
Wasn't all that bad. was it?

1557
01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:22.135
Mm.

1558
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:25.138
Hey. and look at us!

1559
01:03:25.138 --> 01:03:27.640
We still got to wear
our fancy clothes.

1560
01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.808
Yes.

1561
01:03:30.643 --> 01:03:31.436
You...

1562
01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:35.231
You look fantastic.

1563
01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:36.274
Thank you. handsome.

1564
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.240
I know that we
weren't supposed to talk

1565
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.575
about soccer on our date.

1566
01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:48.495
but I have one thing
that I want to say.

1567
01:03:50.163 --> 01:03:52.457
I think our girls are
gonna win the championship.

1568
01:03:52.457 --> 01:03:53.333
Wait. I'm sorry.

1569
01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:54.334
Did you just say "win"?

1570
01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:56.002
Yeah.

1571
01:03:56.002 --> 01:03:57.504
Aren't you the guy who
doesn't believe in winning?

1572
01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.756
Oh my gosh.

1573
01:03:59.756 --> 01:04:01.299
Well. I gotta say
it feels really good

1574
01:04:01.299 --> 01:04:03.593
to have a little bit of
that competitive fire back.

1575
01:04:03.593 --> 01:04:05.053
and I have you to thank for it.

1576
01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:09.849
Oh!
- You're welcome.

1577
01:04:09.849 --> 01:04:11.810
No!

1578
01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.353
It's on! Get ready.

1579
01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:15.271
I'm gonna ruin that
pretty dress of yours.

1580
01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:16.856
Oh. no. I dare you.

1581
01:04:16.856 --> 01:04:18.817
I dare you.

1582
01:04:18.817 --> 01:04:20.819
All right. you...

1583
01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:21.653
Are lucky.

1584
01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:23.947
Saved by the bell?

1585
01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:24.656
Yeah. I was gonna
carry some stuff.

1586
01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:25.740
I'll be right back.

1587
01:04:31.204 --> 01:04:32.956
Coach.

1588
01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.166
Maya said you talked. but
I wanted to make it official.

1589
01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:36.042
You're reinstated.

1590
01:04:39.045 --> 01:04:40.630
So. what do you say?

1591
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:41.423
Yes.

1592
01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.341
I wanna come back.

1593
01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:49.681
You're going back to Chicago?

1594
01:04:52.225 --> 01:04:53.059
I guess I am.

1595
01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:56.855
How long have you known?

1596
01:04:56.855 --> 01:04:58.440
Maya said it
was a possibility.

1597
01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:02.110
but I just got
the official word.

1598
01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:10.035
I've had so much fun with
you. but this is my career.

1599
01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:11.369
You understand?

1600
01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:12.203
Yeah. of course.

1601
01:05:13.913 --> 01:05:15.040
Of course I understand.

1602
01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:19.961
But also. it feels
like we have something.

1603
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.803
We definitely
do have something.

1604
01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.767
But also. I've been
down this road.

1605
01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:40.899
I know how hard it is with
me constantly traveling.

1606
01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:42.150
It's never worked before.

1607
01:05:44.152 --> 01:05:45.487
Yeah. but also...

1608
01:05:49.866 --> 01:05:51.493
It's never been
you and me before.

1609
01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:58.458
Wow.

1610
01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:01.127
What?

1611
01:06:01.127 --> 01:06:02.462
I just realized
that I have a type.

1612
01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:05.006
That's not fair.

1613
01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:08.093
I don't put my package on you.

1614
01:06:08.093 --> 01:06:10.553
No. because that would
mean you'd have to let me in.

1615
01:06:10.553 --> 01:06:12.972
which is something I think
you might be incapable of.

1616
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.560
I'm sorry. I don't
mean to say that.

1617
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.729
It's fine. I want
you to be happy.

1618
01:06:19.729 --> 01:06:22.273
I want you to succeed.

1619
01:06:22.273 --> 01:06:24.442
And I think what we have to do

1620
01:06:24.442 --> 01:06:25.735
is just focus on the girls

1621
01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:26.945
and get them to
the championship.

1622
01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:29.656
and then at least
they can have a win.

1623
01:07:16.161 --> 01:07:17.162
Em.

1624
01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:18.538
Stop punishing yourself.

1625
01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:19.748
I'm not punishing myself.

1626
01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:20.915
I'm training.

1627
01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:21.875
Sure. yeah.

1628
01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:22.584
Go for it.

1629
01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:26.129
Ava. why don't you get
your auntie a towel?

1630
01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:33.762
Em? Doing okay?

1631
01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:35.430
Yeah. I'm fine.

1632
01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:39.309
Just...

1633
01:07:42.687 --> 01:07:43.938
Just. what did he think?

1634
01:07:45.899 --> 01:07:48.860
That I was gonna give up my
career and uproot my life?

1635
01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.445
He knew I wanted
back on the team.

1636
01:07:51.279 --> 01:07:52.781
Yeah. sure.

1637
01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:54.449
But maybe he thought
he was the team too.

1638
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:04.626
Who is it?

1639
01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:06.586
Hello?

1640
01:08:07.962 --> 01:08:09.172
Oh. hi. Coach.

1641
01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:13.510
I understand.

1642
01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:18.139
Natalie is injured.

1643
01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:23.436
Coach needs me back in
Chicago immediately.

1644
01:08:27.023 --> 01:08:29.359
So you're not gonna be
there for the championships?

1645
01:08:31.152 --> 01:08:32.362
I'm so sorry.

1646
01:08:34.322 --> 01:08:36.116
It's fine.

1647
01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:37.826
I knew you'd leave.

1648
01:08:37.826 --> 01:08:39.119
Oh...

1649
01:08:54.134 --> 01:08:54.884
Oh. hey.

1650
01:08:55.844 --> 01:08:56.678
Hey.

1651
01:08:59.264 --> 01:09:00.724
I just came here to tell you

1652
01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:04.728
that I'm going back to
Chicago sooner than expected.

1653
01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.440
In fact. I'm heading there now.

1654
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.864
Wow.

1655
01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:20.493
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna be
here for the championships.

1656
01:09:22.704 --> 01:09:23.705
But you don't need me.

1657
01:09:26.708 --> 01:09:27.542
No.

1658
01:09:30.003 --> 01:09:31.171
No.

1659
01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:31.880
We'll be fine.

1660
01:09:35.717 --> 01:09:38.720
Why did you come tell
me this in person?

1661
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.554
I...

1662
01:09:43.391 --> 01:09:44.392
It's just...

1663
01:09:50.231 --> 01:09:51.274
I don't know.

1664
01:09:53.735 --> 01:09:54.527
Okay.

1665
01:09:55.862 --> 01:09:57.947
Have a really good flight.

1666
01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:01.076
Goodbye.

1667
01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:25.600
We should go.

1668
01:10:42.909 --> 01:10:44.369
Ava. I'm sorry.

1669
01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:45.745
I'm not leaving you.

1670
01:10:45.745 --> 01:10:46.663
I'm just...

1671
01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:52.544
We're gonna video
chat all the time.

1672
01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:54.087
and I'm gonna visit so much
you're gonna be sick of me.

1673
01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:56.923
I could never get sick of you.

1674
01:10:56.923 --> 01:10:59.759
Clearly you've never had
to share a room with her.

1675
01:10:59.759 --> 01:11:00.760
Ha. ha. ha.

1676
01:11:01.594 --> 01:11:02.303
For the ride.

1677
01:11:03.638 --> 01:11:04.347
Oh...

1678
01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:07.434
I don't deserve you.

1679
01:11:08.476 --> 01:11:10.228
Yes. you do.

1680
01:11:10.228 --> 01:11:11.021
And I deserve you.

1681
01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:21.322
I'll come around a lot.

1682
01:11:21.322 --> 01:11:23.074
Good.

1683
01:11:23.074 --> 01:11:25.368
'Cause it doesn't have to
be either soccer or us.

1684
01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:27.620
I know.

1685
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:29.539
Because...

1686
01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:32.292
We need you.

1687
01:11:50.977 --> 01:11:53.021
I miss you guys already.

1688
01:12:18.838 --> 01:12:20.674
Chen is back. baby!

1689
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:25.387
It's so good to have you back.

1690
01:12:25.387 --> 01:12:26.721
It's good to be back.

1691
01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.515
Yeah.
let's win this!

1692
01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:31.393
Yeah. we
got our star player back...

1693
01:12:44.531 --> 01:12:46.533
Keep it going.

1694
01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:47.367
Good.

1695
01:12:48.326 --> 01:12:49.744
Think we still have a shot?

1696
01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:53.081
We'll be fine
without her. Sheila.

1697
01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:55.166
Oh. okay.

1698
01:12:57.377 --> 01:12:58.837
Okay.

1699
01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:01.297
Okay. nice. nice.

1700
01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:02.173
Nice.

1701
01:13:02.173 --> 01:13:03.383
Sharp. sharp.

1702
01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:04.384
Nice. in the corner.

1703
01:13:05.677 --> 01:13:08.054
Okay. here we go. Here we go.

1704
01:13:08.054 --> 01:13:09.597
It's okay. it's okay.

1705
01:13:16.187 --> 01:13:17.480
She'll get there.

1706
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.273
Yeah.

1707
01:13:19.899 --> 01:13:20.942
All right.

1708
01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:22.527
Let's go!

1709
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:24.654
Hi. Cucu!

1710
01:13:24.654 --> 01:13:25.739
Just leaving rehearsal.

1711
01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:28.950
Every time I call you. you're
in the middle of rehearsal.

1712
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:30.326
I know.

1713
01:13:30.326 --> 01:13:32.579
Our rehearsal schedule
has been intense.

1714
01:13:32.579 --> 01:13:34.664
but I'm totally off book now.

1715
01:13:34.664 --> 01:13:37.751
and we just finished
blocking our last scene.

1716
01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:39.878
I don't understand half
of what you just said.

1717
01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:42.255
but you sound
super professional.

1718
01:13:42.255 --> 01:13:44.424
I can't believe I'm gonna
miss your big debut.

1719
01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:46.718
I know. Same.

1720
01:13:46.718 --> 01:13:49.387
But I completely understand.

1721
01:13:49.387 --> 01:13:52.057
We working women have important
demands to keep up with.

1722
01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:53.266
Exactly.

1723
01:13:55.393 --> 01:13:56.603
Go. Have fun.

1724
01:13:57.604 --> 01:13:58.938
Okay. love ya!

1725
01:14:12.619 --> 01:14:13.536
Thank you.

1726
01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:14.454
Look what I got.

1727
01:14:14.454 --> 01:14:15.455
Oh my gosh.

1728
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:16.414
- They're done.
- Oh my God!

1729
01:14:16.414 --> 01:14:17.290
They're exactly the same size.

1730
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:18.249
Yeah. not really. but-

1731
01:14:18.249 --> 01:14:19.125
Yeah. okay.

1732
01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:20.585
How can I help you?

1733
01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:21.961
You taught me something
really valuable...

1734
01:14:24.381 --> 01:14:25.715
Hey!

1735
01:14:25.715 --> 01:14:27.092
Just wanted to wish
you good luck...

1736
01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:29.761
I mean. to tell you break a leg.

1737
01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:30.512
Thanks. Dad.

1738
01:14:32.347 --> 01:14:34.808
I'm just a little bummed that
Auntie Em isn't gonna be here.

1739
01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:37.018
Surprise!

1740
01:14:37.018 --> 01:14:40.605
Auntie Em!

1741
01:14:40.605 --> 01:14:43.650
I'm so happy you're here!

1742
01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:44.776
I'm so proud of you!

1743
01:14:46.111 --> 01:14:46.945
- Okay.
- Okay.

1744
01:14:46.945 --> 01:14:48.238
We gotta go.

1745
01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:49.656
Bye!

1746
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:55.787
I'm so excited.

1747
01:14:55.787 --> 01:14:57.455
Oh. hey.

1748
01:14:57.455 --> 01:14:58.289
How are you?

1749
01:14:58.289 --> 01:14:59.833
Good. good.

1750
01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:01.960
Wasn't sitting there
when I put my coat down.

1751
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:02.711
Uh huh.

1752
01:15:13.179 --> 01:15:14.681
I thought you were in Chicago.

1753
01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:20.311
It hit me that I wouldn't
miss Ava's big opening.

1754
01:15:20.311 --> 01:15:21.229
so I just...

1755
01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:25.692
Give me excess
of it that. surfeiting.

1756
01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:27.527
the appetite may sicken-

1757
01:15:27.527 --> 01:15:28.403
We can talk later.

1758
01:15:28.403 --> 01:15:29.195
And so die.

1759
01:15:35.535 --> 01:15:38.204
What country.
friends. is this?

1760
01:15:38.204 --> 01:15:39.748
This is Illyria. lady.

1761
01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:44.502
And what should
I do in Illyria?

1762
01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:45.420
She's so good.

1763
01:15:46.379 --> 01:15:47.589
Yeah. she is.

1764
01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:50.383
Assure yourself.

1765
01:15:50.383 --> 01:15:53.845
And so perchance. may he be.

1766
01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:57.182
♪ What's to come
is still unsure ♪

1767
01:15:57.182 --> 01:16:00.393

1768
01:16:00.393 --> 01:16:02.729

1771
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:17.952
Ava!

1772
01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.001
She's so good!

1773
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:25.835
I'm gonna go find Ava.

1774
01:16:25.835 --> 01:16:26.586
Be right there.

1775
01:16:30.215 --> 01:16:31.299
You're back.

1776
01:16:33.885 --> 01:16:35.136
I guess I realized that

1777
01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:38.932
it doesn't have to be
either soccer or...

1778
01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:42.811
Being here.

1779
01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:47.273
I can be both a great soccer
player and a great person.

1780
01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:48.483
Yeah. you can.

1781
01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.695
I was hoping I could still

1782
01:16:51.695 --> 01:16:53.697
coach the championship with you.

1783
01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:54.656
That should be fine.

1784
01:16:56.491 --> 01:16:58.785
As long as we can both agree
to keep things professional.

1785
01:16:58.785 --> 01:16:59.786
But I don't want to...

1786
01:17:01.871 --> 01:17:02.706
Oh!

1787
01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:03.623
Hi!

1788
01:17:03.623 --> 01:17:05.083
Oh my gosh!

1789
01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.626
There she is.

1790
01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:08.253
Kid. you were amazing on stage.

1791
01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:09.087
You were a natural.

1792
01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:10.213
Thanks. Coach.

1793
01:17:10.213 --> 01:17:11.715
You were incredible.

1794
01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:13.258
Like a young Michelle Yeoh.

1795
01:17:13.258 --> 01:17:14.092
You really think?

1796
01:17:14.092 --> 01:17:15.343
Oh. yeah.

1797
01:17:15.343 --> 01:17:16.469
I sobbed.

1798
01:17:16.469 --> 01:17:18.263
And the last time that I cried.

1799
01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:20.932
was when Gabby Ackerman kicked
my thigh with her cleats.

1800
01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:22.267
It's true.

1801
01:17:23.476 --> 01:17:24.310
- Oh!
- You were so great. kiddo!

1802
01:17:31.317 --> 01:17:32.277
Yay!

1803
01:17:32.277 --> 01:17:33.778
Team Chen!

1804
01:17:43.747 --> 01:17:47.042
Thought you could use these.

1805
01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:48.418
And are
looking very strong.

1806
01:17:48.418 --> 01:17:49.836
as we open up the...

1807
01:17:49.836 --> 01:17:51.004
You ready for today?

1808
01:17:52.839 --> 01:17:54.299
I should be asking you that.

1809
01:17:56.509 --> 01:17:58.511
You don't always have
to be so strong. Cucu.

1810
01:17:58.511 --> 01:17:59.679
It's okay to be sad.

1811
01:18:02.307 --> 01:18:03.058
You're the best.

1812
01:18:09.356 --> 01:18:10.357
Seriously?

1813
01:18:11.316 --> 01:18:12.233
Who raised you?

1814
01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:16.988
- This guy!
- Oh!

1815
01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:19.532
Oh. yeah. okay.

1816
01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:20.617
The "cool dad".

1817
01:18:20.617 --> 01:18:21.493
{\an8}Way to ruin a moment. Dad.

1818
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:24.454
{\an8}Ava.

1819
01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:25.246
{\an8}Can you help me out?

1820
01:18:25.246 --> 01:18:26.706
All right!

1821
01:18:26.706 --> 01:18:27.540
Woo!

1822
01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:31.252
Okay. girls. you've
been working so hard.

1823
01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:33.838
so I just wanted to get
you something special.

1824
01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:35.048
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1825
01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:36.383
That's cool.

1826
01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:37.342
All right. I want
you to remember.

1827
01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:40.220
when you're out there. have fun!

1828
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.515
But also. girls. we
can win this thing.

1829
01:18:43.515 --> 01:18:46.351
But more importantly.
enjoy yourselves.

1830
01:18:47.977 --> 01:18:49.688
Okay. one more thing.

1831
01:18:49.688 --> 01:18:51.523
The goalkeeper is very tall.

1832
01:18:51.523 --> 01:18:53.233
so keep your shots
on the ground.

1833
01:18:54.734 --> 01:18:55.860
All right. on three.

1834
01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.404
Purple Thunder. one. two. three!

1835
01:18:57.404 --> 01:18:59.531
Purple Thunder!

1836
01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:01.533
Go get 'em. go
get 'em. go get 'em.

1837
01:19:01.533 --> 01:19:02.367
You. listen.

1838
01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:03.368
You're fast.

1839
01:19:03.368 --> 01:19:04.911
And I want you to be fast.

1840
01:19:04.911 --> 01:19:06.287
I had no idea that you
could do the things

1841
01:19:06.287 --> 01:19:07.956
that you can do.
so do it. go in.

1842
01:19:07.956 --> 01:19:09.040
Okay?
- Okay.

1843
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.458
And have fun. Have fun.

1844
01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:12.168
Finals!

1845
01:19:12.168 --> 01:19:13.044
Right?

1846
01:19:13.044 --> 01:19:14.254
I mean. oh my gosh.

1847
01:19:14.254 --> 01:19:15.213
Well...

1848
01:19:15.213 --> 01:19:16.840
- Coach.
- Ava.

1849
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.091
Hey. what's this?

1850
01:19:18.091 --> 01:19:19.551
My aunt also had these made.

1851
01:19:20.885 --> 01:19:22.012
Thank you.

1852
01:19:49.456 --> 01:19:52.959
So. I made a
slight adjustment.

1853
01:19:53.793 --> 01:19:54.586
Coach.

1854
01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.173
Ava.

1855
01:19:59.257 --> 01:20:01.176
Yeah. she's a good girl.

1856
01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:05.764
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1857
01:20:06.848 --> 01:20:07.640
I'm just...

1858
01:20:09.559 --> 01:20:11.061
I don't have the
best track record.

1859
01:20:11.061 --> 01:20:15.023
and I'm not always great
at being on a team.

1860
01:20:15.023 --> 01:20:16.691
I know.

1861
01:20:16.691 --> 01:20:18.360
You got a whole year in
Chicago to work on that. so.

1862
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:22.322
Actually. I realized that
Chicago isn't for me anymore.

1863
01:20:24.866 --> 01:20:27.410
I mean. I got everything
that I thought I wanted.

1864
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:30.663
and instead of feeling
joy. I felt alone.

1865
01:20:32.415 --> 01:20:34.000
It's like I have all
the success in the world

1866
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.335
and it just tastes like ash.

1867
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:40.382
So I asked Coach to
move me closer to home.

1868
01:20:41.508 --> 01:20:43.176
Wait. what?

1869
01:20:44.344 --> 01:20:45.512
Are you kid...

1870
01:20:48.264 --> 01:20:49.182
Are you kidding? You're
playing for the Triumphs?

1871
01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:50.183
Yeah.

1872
01:20:50.183 --> 01:20:52.977
In Seattle? Like an hour away?

1873
01:20:55.855 --> 01:20:57.649
So I'm gonna have so much time

1874
01:20:57.649 --> 01:21:00.235
to help you with the complex.
if you decide to do it.

1875
01:21:00.235 --> 01:21:01.653
Well. I hope I
decide to do it.

1876
01:21:01.653 --> 01:21:04.948
because I signed the lease.

1877
01:21:04.948 --> 01:21:06.282
Yes!

1878
01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:20.005
Yeah!

1879
01:21:20.005 --> 01:21:23.216
- Let's go Thunder!
- Come on. Thunder!

1880
01:21:23.216 --> 01:21:24.217
Over here!

1881
01:21:25.343 --> 01:21:26.344
Pass it to Chen.

1882
01:21:26.344 --> 01:21:29.139
Go. go. go. go. go. go!

1883
01:21:41.359 --> 01:21:42.318
Oh. it's okay.

1884
01:21:42.318 --> 01:21:43.111
No!

1885
01:21:51.911 --> 01:21:53.038
Yeah!

1886
01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:53.788
Yes. yes!

1887
01:21:58.835 --> 01:21:59.586
Oh. oh!

1888
01:22:02.672 --> 01:22:03.965
Come on!

1889
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:07.719
Come on! Let's go!

1890
01:22:10.847 --> 01:22:13.058
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1891
01:22:23.485 --> 01:22:24.277
We won!

1892
01:22:27.572 --> 01:22:28.323
Team Chen!

1893
01:22:38.375 --> 01:22:39.793
Look what I got.

1894
01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:42.128
Here's the game ball. Coach.

1895
01:22:42.128 --> 01:22:43.129
Woo!

1896
01:22:43.129 --> 01:22:44.881
Thanks. Coach.

1897
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:45.799
So...

1898
01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:48.510
An hour away. huh?

1899
01:22:49.969 --> 01:22:51.554
I'll have my apartment
in Seattle for practice.

1900
01:22:51.554 --> 01:22:55.058
and then I'll be across the
street for the rest of the week.

1901
01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:56.142
Sounds like you won.

1902
01:22:57.602 --> 01:22:59.104
Sounds like we both won.
