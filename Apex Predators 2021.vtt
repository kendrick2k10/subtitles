Oh I'm just out here

these things jump.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.742
these things are crazy.

195

So much to do before
the grand opening Sunday

214
00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:06.206
and very little time.

215
00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:07.759
Now. first things first.

216
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.142
Sheri. did you inform the
newspaper about the time?

217
00:16:12.074 --> 00:16:13.317
- Yes. sir.

218
00:16:13.317 --> 00:16:14.594
The press will be here
about 30 minutes early.

Eric. what about the permits?

221
00:16:20.082 --> 00:16:21.808
- The mayor will be here
tomorrow to sign off on them.

222
00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:23.085
After that. we'll be all good.

223

- [Robert] Excellent.

224
00:16:24.397 --> 00:16:26.019
- What would you
like me to do. sir?

225
00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.608
- Well. I want you to follow me.

226
00:16:28.608 --> 00:16:31.197
I'm gonna give you a
tour of the grounds

227
00:16:31.197 --> 00:16:33.440
and one day this will
all be yours. you know?

228
00:16:35.373 --> 00:16:39.412
And you two. I would ask
you to do the cleaning

229
00:16:39.412 --> 00:16:43.312
we need to finish the mopping

230
00:16:43.312 --> 00:16:45.521

233
00:16:50.285 --> 00:16:52.183
and we'll go over
the plan for Sunday.

234
00:16:53.874 --> 00:16:54.979
Follow me. kid.

235
00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:00.019
- I know man.

236
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.537
It's crazy what
happened to that chick.

237
00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:03.953
- Do you think it could of
been a shark that did it?

238
00:17:03.953 --> 00:17:05.093
- Dude. I wouldn't doubt it.

239
00:17:05.093 --> 00:17:06.508
Man. this beach is so trashed.

240
00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:07.957
like anything's possible.

241
00:17:07.957 --> 00:17:09.235
I wouldn't be surprised
if a shark bit her.

242
00:17:09.235 --> 00:17:10.374
He was probably pissed off.

243
00:17:10.374 --> 00:17:12.238
- You really think so?

244
00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:13.170
- Yeah. I mean.

245
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.172
Listen. this is Oceanside.

246
00:17:15.172 --> 00:17:16.656
It's not gonna happen out here.

247
00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:18.278
that was over in Newport Beach.

248
00:17:18.278 --> 00:17:20.280
I mean. nothing ever
happens out here.

249
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.626

250
00:17:21.626 --> 00:17:23.456

I'm so sorry I'm late.

256
00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:40.818
I had a client last minute

257
00:17:40.818 --> 00:17:43.441
and it took me
forever to get ready.

258
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:44.546
- You're worth the wait.

259
00:17:47.445 --> 00:17:48.274
- I knew it.

260
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.311
It's that side bitch Rebecca.

261

- The girl he
cheated on you with?

262
00:17:53.693 --> 00:17:55.557
- That's her.

263
00:17:55.557 --> 00:17:56.834
But it's all good.

- So. tell me about
this client of yours.

268
00:18:05.394 --> 00:18:06.326
- No. no more work.

269
00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:08.466
I'm done with work today.

270
00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.468
Tell me. how was your morning?

271
00:18:10.468 --> 00:18:12.367
- So far so good.

272
00:18:12.367 --> 00:18:13.299
Did you hear about the body

273
00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:14.921
that washed up at Newport Beach?

274
00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:17.510
- No. I haven't heard anything.

275
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.338
- Really?

276
00:18:18.338 --> 00:18:19.581
- Really.

277
00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:20.823
- Some people are saying
it's a serial killer.

278
00:18:20.823 --> 00:18:22.584
I'm willing to bet it's a shark.

279
00:18:22.584 --> 00:18:24.103
- A shark?

280
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.104
Why do you think that?

281
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.760
- They found the body in pieces.

282
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:30.109
Right. her friend was
asleep when this happened.

283
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.317
- Okay.

284

- If there's a serial killer.

285
00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:33.526
why would you leave her alive

286
00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:35.528
and they. why put the
body in shallow water.

287
00:18:35.528 --> 00:18:36.770
it was found immediately.

288
00:18:38.082 --> 00:18:39.463
- Good point.

289
00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:41.050
But if it is a shark.

290
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.605
hopefully it stays
away from here

291
00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:45.296

weekend we're having

before she passed away.

My younger brother
still talks to him.

303

- People make mistakes.

304
00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:18.847
And he's your father.

305
00:19:20.262 --> 00:19:23.369
Don't you think you
could talk to him maybe?

306
00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:25.440
How long haven't you
been talking to him?

307

- Since the fight
about three years ago.

308
00:19:28.581 --> 00:19:31.273
- So don't you think a good
conversation is in order?

What?

trying to do to me?

00:19:36.727 --> 00:19:37.969
- Nothing.

needs their parents.

My parents are still in Bulgaria

314
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.980
and I would do anything
to be with them right now.

315
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.983
Your father lives
right down the road

316
00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.709
and you don't even talk to him.

317
00:19:55.159 --> 00:19:57.541
Don't you think it's time to
forgive and forget. maybe?

318
00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:00.337
- I mean maybe.

319
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.511
You don't even know my father.

320
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.893
He can be a real player.

321
00:20:04.893 --> 00:20:07.482
Besides. I don't think he
ever apologized to my mom.

322
00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:08.724
- So?

323
00:20:08.724 --> 00:20:10.278
You be the bigger man
and you forgive him.

324
00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:15.006
Besides. I really want
the popcorn shrimp.

that for some reason they're
forming a mob mentality

548
00:32:03.162 --> 00:32:05.751
and attacking in various
places all at once?

549
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.997
- Sharks can't process
thoughts that way.

550
00:32:09.997 --> 00:32:13.241
However. some experts
believe they possess ESP

551
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:15.450
and can use it to
communicate with each other

552
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.935
over vast distances.

553
00:32:18.074 --> 00:32:19.730
- Dogs and cats
do it all the time

554
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.250

if they get lost.

A girl I went to
high school with

556

lost her pet cat
Fluffy during a move

557
00:32:26.289 --> 00:32:27.911
and it showed up to her new home

558
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:30.879
over 100 miles away
like a week later.

559
00:32:34.193 --> 00:32:35.125
It's true.

560

- If you have any evidence
from that attacks.

561
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.442
we could try running some tests

562
00:32:41.442 --> 00:32:44.100
and see if the shark DNA
matches between victims.

563
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.723
- I don't know if
that can be possible

564
00:32:46.723 --> 00:32:49.174

the local authorities.

570
