The escapades of
the Royal Canaries
are storied and vast.

This here
is General Chirp Bird.

I heard he had
solid fundamentals.

394
00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.520
but his defense was
lackluster at best.

395
00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:23.190
Huh. Weird.

396
00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:25.726
And this lavender lady
is Queen Honk.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.738
She was also the mother of
our most recent ruler.

Queen Aoogah.

402
00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:43.143
She did so much
for our fine people.

<i>And I also understand that
she was an accomplished

407
00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:01.027
She truly was the glue
that held our island together.

408
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.663
But enough about all that.

409
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.265
Someday you'll have a portrait

I bet you can't.

412
00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:15.441

00:36:53.947 --> 00:36:55.381
[growls]

711
00:36:55.448 --> 00:36:58.885
Get ready
for a real stunt spectacular.
you two.

712
00:36:58.952 --> 00:37:00.219
Cha-chung!

713
00:37:00.687 --> 00:37:01.822
Huzzah!

714
00:37:01.888 --> 00:37:02.889
[Tweety] Whoo-hoo!

715
00:37:02.956 --> 00:37:03.824
[Sylvester] Ahhh! Ahhh!

716
00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:06.626
[Sylvester screams]

717
00:37:07.326 --> 00:37:08.394
Whoo-hoo! [laughing]

718
00:37:09.096 --> 00:37:10.564
[groans]

719
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.297
Huh?

720
00:37:11.363 --> 00:37:13.432
[buoys dinging]

721
00:37:13.967 --> 00:37:17.403
[screams. huffs]

722
00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:24.310
[whimpering]

723
00:37:25.979 --> 00:37:26.847
[grunts]

724
00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:30.684
Wee!

725
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:33.153
-[shark belches]
-[Sylvester groans]

726
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.889
Got you this time. [laughs]

727
00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:38.024
Hmm? [groans] I can't see.

728
00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:39.325
[Diego] Ahhh!

729
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:40.761
[all scream]

730
00:37:40.827 --> 00:37:41.728
[thuds]

731
00:37:44.263 --> 00:37:45.932
Hurray!

732
00:37:45.999 --> 00:37:47.500
Hurray.

733
00:37:48.235 --> 00:37:49.503
[groans]

734
00:37:51.872 --> 00:37:53.006
It's night time.

735
00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:57.043
[snoring]

736
00:38:06.653 --> 00:38:09.823
I can't let Diego and his goons
hurt Tweety.

737
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.558
Maybe if I get
some photo evidence.

738
00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:14.027
everyone will finally
believe me.

739
00:38:14.094 --> 00:38:15.862
It's time to go...

740
00:38:17.396 --> 00:38:19.032
Undercover.

741
00:38:21.835 --> 00:38:22.702
Undercover.

742
00:38:25.038 --> 00:38:25.906
Undercover.

743
00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:28.008
Undercover.

744
00:38:28.074 --> 00:38:28.942
Undercover.

745
00:38:30.243 --> 00:38:31.343
Undercover.

746
00:38:32.378 --> 00:38:33.445
Undercover.

747
00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:35.749
Undercover.

748
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.986
Undercover.

749
00:38:40.053 --> 00:38:41.922
Undercover.
undercover. undercover.

750
00:38:41.988 --> 00:38:44.157
Undercover.
undercover. undercover.

751
00:38:44.224 --> 00:38:45.091
[Diego muttering in distance]

752
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.761
Undercover?

753
00:38:48.962 --> 00:38:49.830
[indiscernible]

754
00:38:54.301 --> 00:38:55.702
[gasps]

755
00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.338
[gasps]

756
00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:04.778
Oh. phew.

757
00:39:05.779 --> 00:39:07.180
Hmm.

758
00:39:07.247 --> 00:39:09.783
[indistinct conversation]

759
00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:16.723
Ugh. I can't tell
what they're saying.

760
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:19.659
I'm gonna have
to get extra sneaky.

761
00:39:19.726 --> 00:39:22.829
Cat reflexes. engage.

762
00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:23.763
[huffs]

763
00:39:26.299 --> 00:39:30.103
So Green Bean. you came up
with this cake recipe
all by yourself?

764
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:31.037
Mmm-hmm.

765
00:39:33.405 --> 00:39:34.941
Hmm.

766
00:39:35.008 --> 00:39:38.377
Well. I think
it's fan-taste-ic.

767
00:39:38.444 --> 00:39:39.880
[chuckles]

768
00:39:39.946 --> 00:39:40.847
Mmm.

769
00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:46.786
Yes. the cake is lovely.
but I'm still frustrated.

770
00:39:46.853 --> 00:39:49.723
None of my treacherous
"accidents" are working.

771
00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:52.692
I thought we would have
gotten rid of the King by now.

772
00:39:52.759 --> 00:39:56.796
But his doofus cat brother
keeps messing everything up.

773
00:39:56.863 --> 00:39:59.465
"Doofus cat brother"?
[grunts]

774
00:39:59.532 --> 00:40:00.600
[gasps]

775
00:40:04.237 --> 00:40:05.672
[Diego] Hmm.

776
00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:08.041
Anyways. we're going to have
to resort to Plan B.

777
00:40:08.108 --> 00:40:12.012
I just don't know exactly
what Plan B is yet.

778
00:40:12.078 --> 00:40:15.916
Well. Green Bean and I had
a good idea. Check it out.

779
00:40:15.982 --> 00:40:18.484
Normal-looking bird seed cone.
right?

780
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:20.887
But then... bam! Knife.

781
00:40:22.055 --> 00:40:25.292
I feel like people will notice
you know.

782
00:40:25.358 --> 00:40:27.861
the very conspicuous knife.

783
00:40:30.563 --> 00:40:31.798
[gasps]

784
00:40:31.865 --> 00:40:32.732
[growling]

785
00:40:34.668 --> 00:40:35.835
[mimics gurgling]

786
00:40:37.804 --> 00:40:42.108
Here. perhaps we should return
to our evil plan board.

787
00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:44.711
[gasps] Evil plan board?

788
00:40:44.778 --> 00:40:46.646
Now. let's see here.

789
00:40:47.714 --> 00:40:49.716
Undercover evidence.

790
00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:52.218
What if you use like.
a slingshot?

791
00:40:52.285 --> 00:40:56.056
Like. a really big slingshot.
With a knife in it?

792
00:40:56.122 --> 00:40:57.657
I gotta document this.

793
00:40:57.724 --> 00:40:59.559
[Diego] Have we tried
dropping a brick on him?

794
00:40:59.626 --> 00:41:01.127
I mean. he is little.

795
00:41:01.194 --> 00:41:03.863
I feel like we could probably
just drop a brick on him.

796
00:41:05.464 --> 00:41:06.666
[all] Hmm?

797
00:41:07.466 --> 00:41:09.869
Bizarre. Hmm.

798
00:41:09.936 --> 00:41:11.538
It may not be very original.

799
00:41:11.604 --> 00:41:15.075
but we could do
some sort of
bird seed dynamite thing.

800
00:41:18.111 --> 00:41:22.782
Jackpot. I can show this
to the other guards
and Tweety will be safe.

801
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:24.985
Hey. Puddy Tat. Whatcha up to?

802
00:41:25.051 --> 00:41:26.052
Ahhh!

803
00:41:28.088 --> 00:41:31.691
Huh? Cat spy.
Guards! Eat his camera.

804
00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:37.496
Oh. no. you don't. cat.

805
00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:39.199
[Tweety] Hello.

806
00:41:39.265 --> 00:41:41.067
[Diego gasps] The King.

807
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.969
[giggles]

808
00:41:43.036 --> 00:41:44.738
Well. well. well.

809
00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:48.174
Here I was. trying to come up
with a sneaky way
to dispose of the King.

810
00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:52.679
and you've delivered him
right into my hands in secret

811
00:41:52.746 --> 00:41:55.849
with no members of the public
around to see.

812
00:41:56.416 --> 00:41:57.584
[laughs]

813
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.952
[Tweety giggles]

814
00:41:59.019 --> 00:42:00.453
[laughs]

815
00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.456
And here I thought you were
some sort of useless bing-bong.

816
00:42:03.556 --> 00:42:05.158
always getting in my way.

817
00:42:05.225 --> 00:42:06.593
Uh...

818
00:42:06.659 --> 00:42:08.661
This works out perfectly.

819
00:42:08.728 --> 00:42:09.729
Phase one.

820
00:42:09.796 --> 00:42:11.164
I'll get rid of His Highness.

821
00:42:11.231 --> 00:42:13.700
Then I'll put all the blame
on you.

822
00:42:13.767 --> 00:42:17.070
After all. no one's going
to believe anything you say.

823
00:42:17.137 --> 00:42:18.238
You're a cat.

824
00:42:18.304 --> 00:42:20.173
Phase two.

825
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.110
The Royal Adviser. who is me.
will be next in line
for the throne.

826
00:42:24.577 --> 00:42:25.545
Magic.

827
00:42:25.612 --> 00:42:27.547
[huffs]

828
00:42:27.614 --> 00:42:31.785
I'll be sworn in
as the rightful king
of the Canary Islands.

829
00:42:31.851 --> 00:42:34.320
and everyone will be
none the wiser.

830
00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:35.588
Phase three.

831
00:42:35.655 --> 00:42:37.390
The lovely Granny

832
00:42:37.457 --> 00:42:39.092
will be so distraught
at the destruction
of your family.

833
00:42:39.159 --> 00:42:41.728
she'll run straight
into my arms for comfort.

834
00:42:41.795 --> 00:42:45.432
and I'll become your step-dad.

835
00:42:45.498 --> 00:42:46.933
[laughs maliciously]

836
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.868
[gasps]

837
00:42:48.935 --> 00:42:51.438
I'm not a fan
of any of these phases.

838
00:42:51.505 --> 00:42:52.705
We're not gonna
let you get away

839
00:42:52.772 --> 00:42:54.542
with all this treacherosity.
Diego.

840
00:42:54.607 --> 00:42:55.543
Yeah.

841
00:42:55.608 --> 00:42:57.310
[Sylvester grunts]

842
00:42:57.377 --> 00:43:00.313
[laughs] We'll see about that.

843
00:43:01.147 --> 00:43:02.382
[clears throat]

844
00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:05.151
[high-pitched] Yes.
Hello? Police station?

845
00:43:05.218 --> 00:43:10.356
I need to report a regicide.
A cat has eaten King Tweety.

846
00:43:10.423 --> 00:43:14.627
Please send
your most intimidating officers
posthaste.

847
00:43:15.895 --> 00:43:19.332
It's been nice knowing you.
Puddy Tat.

848

Izza. Green Bean.
to our super-secret
base location.

849
00:43:25.171 --> 00:43:26.172
Ha-ha!

850
00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:27.974
Puddy Tat. help!

851
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:28.975
Magic!

852
00:43:30.977 --> 00:43:33.547
Uh... Different magic.

853
00:43:33.613 --> 00:43:34.681
Ahhh!

854
00:43:35.215 --> 00:43:36.082

[huffing]

858
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.536
[sobs] Tweety.

859
00:43:55.603 --> 00:43:56.669
[whimpers]

860
00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:00.473
Freeze. cat boy.

861
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:01.407
Huh?

862
00:44:02.576 --> 00:44:03.910
Canary Island PD.

863
00:44:03.977 --> 00:44:07.480
Officers Gnutz and Siedes
reporting for duty.

864
00:44:07.548 --> 00:44:11.784
We got an anonymous tip
that the King's been eaten.

865
00:44:12.385 --> 00:44:13.253
[groans]

866
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.225
<i>-J'accuse!
-Put him in the bird cuff.</i>

867
00:44:19.692 --> 00:44:20.827
Huh? No.

868
00:44:23.863 --> 00:44:24.998
No. Officers.

869
00:44:25.064 --> 00:44:27.000
You've got the wrong guy.

870
00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:32.105
[gasps] Sylvester.
what's going on?

871
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:38.011
This suspicious individual
ate the King. ma'am.

872
00:44:38.077 --> 00:44:42.015
Sylvester. did you eat Tweety?

873
00:44:42.081 --> 00:44:44.585
No! You've got it all wrong.

874
00:44:44.652 --> 00:44:46.886
That's enough out of you.
bird-erer!

875
00:44:46.953 --> 00:44:49.455
We're taking you downtown.

876
00:44:49.523 --> 00:44:51.057
Granny! I didn't do it.

877
00:44:51.124 --> 00:44:54.761
It was Diego.
You gotta believe me. Ooh.

878
00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:56.963
Oh. my!

879
00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:07.140
[grunting]

880
00:45:07.207 --> 00:45:08.041
[panting]

881
00:45:08.107 --> 00:45:10.810
Oh. hey. you're finally awake.

882
00:45:13.346 --> 00:45:14.847
[gasps] Queen Aoogah.

883
00:45:14.914 --> 00:45:16.249
You're alive?

884
00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.886
Well. I mean. more or less.
yeah.

885
00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:21.689
Wait. Who are you?

886
00:45:21.754 --> 00:45:23.122
The name's Tweety Bird.

887
00:45:23.189 --> 00:45:25.559
They bought me here
after you disappeared.

888
00:45:25.626 --> 00:45:26.926
I'm the new king.

889
00:45:27.628 --> 00:45:28.662
Hmm.

890
00:45:28.728 --> 00:45:30.631
New king. huh?

891
00:45:30.698 --> 00:45:33.032
So you're a royal canary. too?

892
00:45:33.099 --> 00:45:34.968
I thought I was
the only one left.

893
00:45:35.034 --> 00:45:37.937
I guess that would make us...
cousins?

894
00:45:39.272 --> 00:45:40.740
You're my cousin?

895
00:45:41.241 --> 00:45:43.476
Wow.

896
00:45:43.544 --> 00:45:46.913
-Cousin poses. quick!
-[both] Hoo-ha-hoo!

897
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:49.048
Family.

898
00:45:49.115 --> 00:45:51.150
Well. okay.
now that we're both here.

899
00:45:51.217 --> 00:45:53.654
maybe we can find a way
to get out of this place.

900
00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:57.390
Two comically-oversized heads
are better than one.

901
00:45:57.457 --> 00:45:58.424
Yeah. that's very true.

902
00:45:59.526 --> 00:46:00.994
Speaking of birdnapping.

903
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.795
How have you been staying
alive here this whole time?

904
00:46:02.862 --> 00:46:06.299
Well. luckily for me. Diego
didn't realize he put the cage

905
00:46:06.366 --> 00:46:09.637
right next to a giant bag
of mixed nuts.

906
00:46:09.703 --> 00:46:11.471
He's an idiot.

907
00:46:11.538 --> 00:46:14.440
And I've been
keeping myself sane
by reading this discarded.

908
00:46:14.508 --> 00:46:17.877
slightly damp
New York travel guide.

909
00:46:17.944 --> 00:46:21.014
Such a strange. exotic land.

910
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.185
The hustle. The bustle.
So intriguing.

911
00:46:26.252 --> 00:46:28.756
Hey. that's where I'm from.

912
00:46:28.821 --> 00:46:30.290
Whoa! No way.

913
00:46:30.356 --> 00:46:31.924
You're from here?

914
00:46:31.991 --> 00:46:34.494
Oh. you've got to tell me
all about it.
I have so many questions.

915
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:36.996
Okay. Like. for instance.
who is this giant woman?

916
00:46:37.063 --> 00:46:41.568
I mean. she's gorgeous.
and I love how green she is.

917
00:46:41.635 --> 00:46:46.740
Oh. yeah. New York's got
an incalculable array
of wonderful elements.

918
00:46:46.806 --> 00:46:49.409
We've got hot dog men.

919
00:46:49.475 --> 00:46:51.612
Yellow beepie cars.

920
00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:54.682
A rat that steals a pizza.

921
00:46:54.748 --> 00:46:56.617
And the subway.

922
00:46:56.684 --> 00:47:00.853
where if you make eye contact
with someone.
you get to fight them.

923
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.991
How convenient that we had
this tiny slide projector here.

924
00:47:05.058 --> 00:47:07.661
Oh. I must visit this place.

925
00:47:07.728 --> 00:47:09.495
But the best part
of New York City

926
00:47:09.563 --> 00:47:14.601
is that I get to visit
all those fun places
with my family.

927
00:47:14.668 --> 00:47:17.437
Your family? Elaborate.

928
00:47:17.504 --> 00:47:21.608
Well. I have my Granny
and my big brother. Puddy Tat.

929
00:47:21.675 --> 00:47:23.876
Interesting names.

930
00:47:23.943 --> 00:47:26.045
Interesting people.

931
00:47:26.112 --> 00:47:27.648
They're the greatest.

932
00:47:27.715 --> 00:47:30.883
We do everything together.

933
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:34.887
Although. I haven't gotten
to spend a lot of time
with them

934
00:47:34.954 --> 00:47:36.690
since I've become king.

935
00:47:36.757 --> 00:47:38.792
I've been far too busy.

936
00:47:38.858 --> 00:47:42.028
I'm really starting
to miss them.

937
00:47:42.095 --> 00:47:45.465
Aw. Granny and Puddy Tat
sound really great.

938
00:47:45.532 --> 00:47:48.468
You know. I've never met
any of my family.

939
00:47:48.535 --> 00:47:51.871
My mom disappeared
before I hatched out of my egg.

940
00:47:51.938 --> 00:47:54.541
It's always been just me.

941
00:47:54.608 --> 00:47:59.813
Well. now you have me.
and Granny and Puddy Tat. too.

942
00:47:59.879 --> 00:48:03.550
Welcome to the family. cousin.

943
00:48:03.617 --> 00:48:06.452
Aw. Thanks. cousin.

944
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.488
[laughing]

945
00:48:08.555 --> 00:48:11.924
Oh. what a lovely little
family reunion.

946
00:48:13.393 --> 00:48:14.561
Boo.

947
00:48:14.628 --> 00:48:15.829
Ahhh!

948
00:48:15.895 --> 00:48:17.897
Hey. let us out of here.
you butt nut!

949
00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:19.633
Mind your manners.

950
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.267
Don't peanut me.

951
00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:23.570
Tweety.
throw the tiny projector
at him.

952
00:48:24.036 --> 00:48:25.104
Hi-yah!

953
00:48:25.773 --> 00:48:26.973
Stop!

954
00:48:27.039 --> 00:48:29.308
Puppy. how could you?

955
00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:31.043
I thought you were my friend.

956
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:34.180
We had that whole
dress-up montage together.

957
00:48:34.247 --> 00:48:37.049
You helped put on underwear.

958
00:48:37.116 --> 00:48:38.786
Sorry. lad. It was all a ruse.

959
00:48:38.852 --> 00:48:40.587
I'm a bad guy.

960
00:48:40.654 --> 00:48:43.156
I have to get you both
out of my way
if I'm going to become...

961
00:48:44.023 --> 00:48:46.125
King.

962
00:48:46.192 --> 00:48:49.228
Ugh. Diego. this is incredibly
whack of you.

963
00:48:49.295 --> 00:48:51.799
Sticks and stones. young lady.

964
00:48:51.865 --> 00:48:54.635
I'm going to be
the most glamorous
and popular king

965
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:56.502
this island's ever seen.

966
00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.137
Everyone will cheer.

967
00:48:58.204 --> 00:49:03.610
"Oh. what a handsome
and wonderful king we have.
Hurrah. hurray!"

968
00:49:03.677 --> 00:49:07.213
And the lovely Granny
will be my bride.

969
00:49:07.648 --> 00:49:08.682
[kisses]

970
00:49:08.749 --> 00:49:10.116
No!

971
00:49:10.183 --> 00:49:12.351
Why are you doing this. puppy?

972
00:49:12.418 --> 00:49:14.922
Because it's my birthright.
That's why.

973
00:49:14.987 --> 00:49:16.723
Uh. birth-what now?

974
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.057
Centuries ago.

975
00:49:18.124 --> 00:49:20.259
we dogs arrived here
and we were like.

976
00:49:20.326 --> 00:49:23.530
"Hey. This is a nice place.
Let's make it ours."

977
00:49:23.597 --> 00:49:25.599
When we got here.
there were a bunch of birds

978
00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:28.034
all over the place.
taking up space.

979
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.939
So we tried bonking them
with our swords.
and chasing them away.

980
00:49:32.004 --> 00:49:36.577
But then.
the treacherous native birds.
led by your family. were like.

981
00:49:36.643 --> 00:49:40.547
"No!"
And fought back against us.

982
00:49:40.614 --> 00:49:42.114
It was extremely rude.

983
00:49:42.181 --> 00:49:45.017
The other dogs were cool
with it. but not me.

984
00:49:45.084 --> 00:49:48.922
A dog is supposed
to be in charge.
and we were here first.

985
00:49:48.988 --> 00:49:51.658
That day. I vowed I would be
the one to set things right

986
00:49:51.725 --> 00:49:55.228
and return the monarchy
to the canines.

987
00:49:55.294 --> 00:50:00.199
Okay. first off. your story
specifically mentions
that there were natives here.

988
00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:02.836
So you were. in fact.
not here first.

989
00:50:02.903 --> 00:50:08.040
And B. how are you
in that flashback?
That was hundreds of years ago.

990
00:50:08.107 --> 00:50:10.544
What are you. like.
immortal or something?

991
00:50:10.611 --> 00:50:14.013
Yeah. I'm a sorcerer.
Of course I'm immortal.

992
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.683
-What?
-I made an immortality potion.

993
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.151
But then I lost the recipe
because the recipe card

994
00:50:19.218 --> 00:50:21.287
blew out of my hand
and fell into the ocean.

995
00:50:21.354 --> 00:50:23.824
It was this whole big to-do.

996
00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:27.895
But that's not the point.
Immortality is nothing
without power.

997
00:50:27.961 --> 00:50:31.632
So I've been trying
to get my hands on the crown
ever since.

998
00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:34.601
Who do you think
has been behind
the mysterious disappearances

999
00:50:34.668 --> 00:50:37.604
of every single one
of the Canary rulers?

1000
00:50:38.437 --> 00:50:40.674
What? No.

1001
00:50:40.741 --> 00:50:44.611
General Chirp may have been
a master of martial matters.

1002
00:50:44.678 --> 00:50:49.148
<i>but they were no match
for my arcane magic.</i>

1003
00:50:49.215 --> 00:50:54.420
<i>King Peep? I switched
his dumb baking soda volcano
out for a real one.</i>

1004
00:50:55.421 --> 00:50:56.657
Ahhh!

1005
00:50:56.723 --> 00:50:58.157
<i>Larry Bird.</i>

1006
00:50:58.224 --> 00:50:59.793
<i>I put a rock in his shoe.</i>

1007
00:51:01.562 --> 00:51:04.698
Ow. My foot.
Now I have to retire.

1008
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:07.701
And Queen Hawk...

1009
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:12.839
<i>I snowballed her.</i>

1010
00:51:12.906 --> 00:51:15.042
Oh. no! Ahhh!

1011
00:51:15.107 --> 00:51:20.547
Every canary disappearance
in the last seven centuries
is all because of me. baby.

1012
00:51:20.614 --> 00:51:24.150
Which is how I was able
to collect all of these.

1013
00:51:24.216 --> 00:51:25.819
Ha ha ha!

1014
00:51:28.187 --> 00:51:29.656
[both gasp]

1015
00:51:29.723 --> 00:51:33.594
A tail-feather
for every monarch I've deposed.

1016
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.664
I personally prefer
collecting stamps.
but to each their own.

1017
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:39.332
You know that idea
that our feathers

1018
00:51:39.398 --> 00:51:42.703
have magical powers
is just a myth. right?

1019
00:51:42.769 --> 00:51:46.707
That's where you're wrong.
little miss. Watch this.

1020
00:51:46.773 --> 00:51:48.575
[chanting]

1021
00:52:07.728 --> 00:52:08.595
Ha ha!

1022
00:52:09.596 --> 00:52:11.765
Well. that was anti-climactic.

1023
00:52:11.832 --> 00:52:15.836
All that pomp and circumstance
for a dumb feather boa?

1024
00:52:15.902 --> 00:52:17.671
It's not dumb.

1025
00:52:17.738 --> 00:52:21.508
A properly-made boa
can give you up to
300 times more power.

1026
00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:25.311
[gasps] That's almost
400 times more power.

1027
00:52:25.378 --> 00:52:27.346
Plus. look how snazzy I look.

1028
00:52:28.615 --> 00:52:30.149
Ooh.

1029
00:52:30.216 --> 00:52:32.351
Man. you look whack as heck.

1030
00:52:32.418 --> 00:52:36.288
No. I don't. I look cool.
And glamorous. And not whack.

1031
00:52:36.355 --> 00:52:38.759
I'm what the kids call "minty."

1032
00:52:40.661 --> 00:52:41.528
Ooh.

1033
00:52:41.995 --> 00:52:42.863
Ooh.

1034
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.565
Magic.

1035
00:52:45.632 --> 00:52:48.769
Get my ancestors off your neck.
you bungus!

1036
00:52:48.835 --> 00:52:51.638
With no more canaries left
after I kidnapped you.

1037
00:52:51.705 --> 00:52:55.307
I was perfectly set to swoop in
and become the new king.

1038
00:52:55.374 --> 00:52:59.946
But then this little dingle
showed up and threw a wrench
in my plans.

1039
00:53:00.013 --> 00:53:01.480
[giggles]

1040
00:53:01.548 --> 00:53:04.450
But ultimately.
it was to my benefit.

1041
00:53:04.518 --> 00:53:08.722
Since now I can take
your feathers
and finally complete my boa.

1042
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:11.290
and fulfill my maximum
magical potential.

1043
00:53:11.357 --> 00:53:12.759
which is even better.

1044
00:53:12.826 --> 00:53:14.661
[laughs]

1045
00:53:14.728 --> 00:53:16.195
You're welcome.

1046
00:53:16.262 --> 00:53:17.664
Now. if you'll excuse me.

1047
00:53:17.731 --> 00:53:21.034
I have a fancy boy
coronation to prepare for.

1048
00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:22.268
Smoke magic!

1049
00:53:26.338 --> 00:53:27.941
Bye. puppy.

1050
00:53:28.008 --> 00:53:29.408
Ugh. what a dweeb.

1051
00:53:29.475 --> 00:53:32.746
Don't worry. Aoogah.
My brother's out there.

1052
00:53:32.813 --> 00:53:36.783
And I'm sure he'll be here
to save us any minute now.

1053
00:53:46.827 --> 00:53:50.564
Alright cat. what did you do
with King Tweety

1054
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:55.367
[Muffled. unintelligible
speech]

1055
00:53:55.434 --> 00:53:57.637
Mmm-hmm. mmm-hmm.

1056
00:53:57.704 --> 00:54:01.007
Ugh. I can't understand a word
he's saying with that cone on.

1057
00:54:01.074 --> 00:54:03.342
[muffled speech]

1058
00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:09.916
What I was trying to say.
officers. is that I didn't do
anything! I'm innocent!

1059
00:54:09.983 --> 00:54:13.987
We found you in the castle.
surrounded by
the King's feathers

1060
00:54:14.054 --> 00:54:18.191
with him nowhere to
