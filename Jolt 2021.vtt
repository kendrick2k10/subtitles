3
00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.730
What makes
a person extraordinary?

4
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.025
Everyone wants to be normal.

5
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.986
But no one wants to be ordinary.

6
00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:30.448
And what is normal?

7
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.534
We all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds.

8
00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:38.914
Normal party. normal family.
normal adorable little girl.

9
00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:43.878
But. there’s always
more behind the facade.

10
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:47.298
Most of the time
Lindy seems quite normal.

11
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:52.303
But buried deep in
her DNA she has a gift.

12
00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.932
Some call it a condition.
or even worse. a disorder.

13
00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.935
that’s just
waiting to be activated

14
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.564
and it makes
her anything but normal.

15
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:07.651
When people do bad things.

16
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:10.196
Lindy cannot control herself.

17
00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:14.408
Maybe if she’d had
that normal loving family.

18
00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.203
she could have
been extraordinary.

19
00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:23.626
But. just like Lindy. mommy
and daddy had their own demons.

20
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.962
Whether it was that mummy’s
pills made her so sleepy.

21
00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:31.634
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much.

22
00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.428
we’ll never know.

23
00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:39.892
But whatever it was. Lindy
never got the love she needed.

24
00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:43.604
Instead. she got
angrier and angrier.

25
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:47.358
and her disorder
got worse and worse.

26
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:53.280
And then her parents
got her diagnosis.

27
00:01:53.364 --> 00:01:57.785
The doctors called it
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

28
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.000
She could not
live safely in the world.

29
00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:09.505
and no one would
be safe around her.

30
00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:13.509
So to live at all.
she would have to live alone.

31
00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:17.638
isolated from others
till the cure could be found.

32
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.725
The huge amount of cortisol
coursing through Lindy’s body.

33
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.646
made her faster than
normal. stronger than normal.

34
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.732
which made her
incredibly attractive

35
00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:31.235
to certain interested parties.

36
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.784
But her condition also
made her extremely volatile

37
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:48.085
and far. far
angrier than normal.

38
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:54.633
Lindy had a hair trigger.
Once provoked. she would snap.

39
00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:00.306
Until she could gain control.
she was no use to anyone.

40
00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.059
Her life as
a human lab rat began.

41
00:03:04.143 --> 00:03:07.021
The results were mixed.

42
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.610
So they thought.
maybe the military

43
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.028
would give her the structure

44
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.947
to channel her unique gifts.

45
00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.577
Or maybe not.

46
00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.387
All right. stop!

47
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:41.680
Get off!

48
00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.143
Get off him. now!

49
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.437
Stop means. stop!

50
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.442
They were
so kind and supportive.

51
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.861
It’s a wonder it didn’t help.

52
00:03:55.945 --> 00:04:00.783
Of course. all these
cures only made it worse.

53
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.036
You would think they’d
learn not to piss her off.

54
00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:11.210
It was looking more and more
like they would just lock her up

55
00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:13.003
and throw away the key.

56
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:18.092
Lindy would be alone. forever.

57
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:23.931
And then a breakthrough.
a chance to be normal.

58
00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.768
The treatment was
brutal. barbaric. outrageous

59
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:31.063
and surprisingly effective.

60
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.447
Like you don’t care

61
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:43.951
I see you right there

62
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.120
Tryna watch my joyride

63
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.398
This is ridiculous.

64
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.400
I’ve been waiting
here for five fucking minutes.

65
00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.819
How hard is it
to find my fucking car keys?

66
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.947
I know. I know. I’m sorry.
but give me just a minute. okay?

67
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.158
Is "fucking idiot" part
of your job description?

68
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.076
I know.
I’m-- I’m sorry. sir...

69
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.661
There’s
like a million keys here.

70
00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:30.122
And apparently you’re too dumb
even for a minimum wage job.

71
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.373
Is this your key?

72
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.167
Yes. that’s
my key. you fucking moron.

73
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:39.715
Hey. this is my car!

74
00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:40.966
Yeah. I think
you forgot something.

75
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.509
-What?
-Your manners.

76
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.097
-Sorry. is this your key?
- Huh?

77
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:49.099
Yes. that’s my
key. you fucking moron.

78
00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.234
Don’t expect a tip!

79
00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:04.531
That she your princess

80
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.795
Um. Justin?

81
00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.798
Hi. I’m Lindy.

82
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:21.882
Hey!

83
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.885
Yeah. actually I’m
not staying so... um.

84
00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.512
I thought a date might be fun.

85
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.846
but I’m not in
the right head-space.

86
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.389
so I didn’t want to bail.

87
00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:31.350
without saying something.
’cause I’m not a total bitch.

88
00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.434
Okay.
-So...

89
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:33.811
You know it’s funny? Uh...

90
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.479
This isn’t even
the worst date I’ve ever had.

91
00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.856
Yeah. I feel bad--
I’m sorry about that--

92
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.941
Herpes!

93
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.401
Yeah. herpes.
chlamydia and. um. warts.

94
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:42.778
Uh...

95
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.946
Okay.

96
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.447
This girl just kept listing off.

97
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.158
all the sexually transmitted
infections she had. It was...

98
00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:49.743
it was unexpected.

99
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.205
Yeah. I mean. warts
generally are. aren’t they?

100
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.541
You don’t have
a disaster date story?

101
00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:59.586
Uh. me? No.
I don’t date that much. No.

102
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.965
Oh. is that ’cause you’re always
leaving before they start?

103
00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.679
No. you’re doing quite well.
I normally don’t even come in.

104
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.180
Oh. why not?

105
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:13.600
I hate people.

106
00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:16.395
Like who?

107
00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.982
I don’t know. People who--
who talk with their mouth full

108
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:24.444
and-- and. uh. people who. who
chew too loudly. people who hum.

109
00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:26.864
Um. men who wear
jeans with flip-flops--

110
00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.407
I can’t stand
people who walk too slow.

111
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.491
Yeah. Exactly.

112
00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:30.951
Or tell you to have a nice day.

113
00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.870
Yeah! Like. fuck off
I might not want a nice day.

114
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.621
Or. uh. people
that talk in elevators.

115
00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:36.165
Yeah. that’s bad.

116
00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:37.708
Yeah. aside from people
that fart in elevators.

117
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.501
That’s-- That’s worse.

118
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:40.752
Do you fart in elevators?

119
00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:42.880
Do you fart?

120
00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.965
No. I’m from
England. we don’t...

121
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.258
Are we ready to order?

122
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.178
I’m actually not
staying. so I don’t know.

123
00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:51.096
Sir. I’m afraid if
she won’t be dining with you.

124
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.681
we will need the table back.

125
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:54.516
Okay.

126
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.934
Now.

127
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.478
Uh...

128
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:00.772
Okay. um...

129
00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:03.025
Okay. I’ll just. um...

130
00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.985
I’ll just have the chicken
really quickly then.

131
00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.528
Uh...

132
00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:08.488
Fish please.
without the pine nuts.

133
00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:10.032
We don’t do substitutions.

134
00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.284
Oh. no. I’m-- I’m--
I’m allergic. so...

135
00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:14.286
It’s restaurant policy.

136
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.041
Uh. okay. The pasta. please.

137
00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.500
There is a walnut sauce.

138
00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:22.544
Uh.
how about the pork chop?

139
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:23.962
Pistachio crust.

140
00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:26.048
Fuck me. Perhaps you can suggest
something that might work.

141
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.382
Please don’t
take that tone with me.

142
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:29.551
-No. I’m not.
-Sir. You are.

143
00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:31.678
You’re making it impossible
for me to impress my date

144
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:33.639
and it’s embarrassing.

145
00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.140
How about the chicken?

146
00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:40.896
Sure.

147
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.439
Thank you.

148
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.650
Let me know if
you need anything else.

149
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:45.734
Thank you.

150
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.488
You know. if you were planning
to stab her with that knife.

151
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.739
it’d be totally cool with me.

152
00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:55.535
Look. I have to pee actually.

153
00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:57.204
-Okay.
- I’ll be right back.

154
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.962
I know. right?

155
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.506
A guy just told
his wife he is having an affair.

156
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:11.802
Some old woman’s
dentures got stuck in her steak.

157
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.055
But hold up. you should see
the first date I just served.

158
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.473
I gave the guy some attitude

159
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.059
and he practically
cried into his napkin.

160
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.853
Yeah. And his date just sat
there and watched him squirm.

161
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:25.232
Oh. my God.
It was so embarrassing.

162
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.317
I mean. screwing with the
customers isn’t fun anymore.

163
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.278
It’s like my own
private freak show.

164
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.947
The guy had. like.

165
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.158
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu.

166
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.327
It was pathetic.

167
00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:40.497
I know.

168
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.124
Total losers.

169
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.542
Anyway...

170
00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:54.553
She’ll call you back.

171
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:01.268
Fuck!

172
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.626
-

173
00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:10.587
Oh! Ain’t you
a fine little piece...

174
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.755
Ow!

175
00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:13.757
Fuck!

176
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.099
It’s not working.

177
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.018
Okay. Fix it!

178
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.896
You’re probably just
building up a tolerance.

179
00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.231
No. I’m not.

180
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.566
Look. this is cutting-edge.
avant-garde treatment.

181
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.859
Okay. Well.
I’m sure you’ll get

182
00:11:32.943 --> 00:11:34.319
the Nobel Prize once
you’re dead.

183
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:35.779
Is that a threat?

184
00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.364
Can you fix it or not?

185
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:39.991
-All right.
- Okay.

186
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:43.745
Here.

187
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.958
Your emotions must
be running pretty high.

188
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.043
in order for you
to override the system.

189
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:52.671
Yeah. I have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol.

190
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.215
so my emotions are
running high all the time.

191
00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.552
But you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse.

192
00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.636
all the time.

193
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.558
So. I’m assuming that the date
was a disappointment then?

194
00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:07.394
Given that its primary function.

195
00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:10.522
was to test if I could partake
in a customary social situation

196
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.982
without beating
the shit out of someone.

197
00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.150
then yeah. I would say yeah.

198
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.901
It was a-- it was
a real disappointment.

199
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.278
How badly did you hurt him?

200
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.488
I didn’t
even get round to him.

201
00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:21.908
Who did you get around to?

202
00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:25.787
A waitress. Look. it doesn’t
matter. Your thing failed.

203
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:29.624
Lindy. this is not
a cure. I’ve told you that.

204
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.334
The only way we’re
going to make progress.

205
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.171
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past.

206
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.505
I’ve told you my story.

207
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.884
But there’s a difference.
between talking about your past.

208
00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.094
and actually working through it.

209
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:58.778
Asphyxiation?

210
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.656
Jugular bleed.

211
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.949
Classy.

212
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.034
Here you go.

213
00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:06.745
I’ve upped the voltage.

214
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.997
but there’s only so much

215
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.832
that the human body can take.

216
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.627
You don’t care about
me. I’m just an experiment.

217
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.088
Why would I risk my
life’s work if I didn’t care?

218
00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.299
And why won’t you admit
that you really like this guy?

219
00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.926
Because I didn’t.

220
00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.385
Okay.

221
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:23.595
Anyway. it doesn’t matter.

222
00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:24.930
I think last night proved that

223
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.015
your exposure therapy
didn’t work.

224
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.643
What-- what-- what
would you like me to do? Hmm?

225
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.520
Would you like me to
put leeches on your skin?

226
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.230
Would you like me to drill
a hole.

227
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.315
in your head to release
the demons?

228
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.567
Would you like me to
make you drink your own urine?

229
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:38.652
Actually tried that.

230
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.237
That’s disgusting.

231
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.864
Anyway. I think
that really you need to admit.

232
00:13:42.948 --> 00:13:44.658
that the answer to all of
your problems

233
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.369
is close.
human connection.

234
00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:50.163
Penis is not
gonna fix me. Dr. Freud.

235
00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:51.414
Um. I just--

236
00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.791
And I’ve tried that as well.

237
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.668
You like this guy. so
for once have a relationship.

238
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:55.752
Oh. please fuck off.

239
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.420
I’m talking about love.

240
00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.880
No. I don’t want a boyfriend!

241
00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:01.132
We both know I’d end up knocking
his teeth down his throat.

242
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.176
Maybe you won’t. but I don’t
know why you would walk away.

243
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.053
from somebody
who made you feel something.

244
00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.263
Ugh!

245
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.639
Okay. I’m walking away
from you.

246
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:08.974
’cause you’re getting on
my nerves.

247
00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.058
Thank you.

248
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.142
See you next week.

249
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:12.686
Yeah. I can’t wait.

250
00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:34.916
Looks so good.

251
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.167
Thank you so much.

252
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.919
Not bad. huh?
-Well...

253
00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.838
Not a shitty waitress in sight!

254
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:41.965
No.

255
00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.383
I’m glad you called.

256
00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.261
I’d hate to miss a second chance
to disappoint a pretty face.

257
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.054
How are you planning
on doing that?

258
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.473
I don’t know.

259
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.059
Depends if you find lame-ass
accountants cool or not.

260
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.312
Well. that depends.
Who do you work for?

261
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.523
I work for a private
company. This guy named Barry.

262
00:14:58.607 --> 00:14:59.608
You? What do you do?

263
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.193
I used to work in Security.

264
00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:06.114
Okay. So you know your way
around a pair of handcuffs?

265
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:10.702
Less BDSM. more...
bouncer in a crappy bar.

266
00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.163
You’re not
a bouncer!

267
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.497
Yeah! What?

268
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.041
What do you weigh?
Like a Buck-O-Eight?

269
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.459
-It’s not about size Justin.
-No?

270
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.877
Don’t know what you’ve heard...

271
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.961
Then what’s it about?

272
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:23.006
Other things.
like speed and endurance.

273
00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.674
fearlessness. things like that.

274
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.551
Okay. What happened?

275
00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:27.636
Mmm...

276
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.804
You crazy bitch!

277
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.849
Um...

278
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.934
I’m currently
seeking a new career path.

279
00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.353
Oh. you got fired.

280
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.021
Yes. Well. it wasn’t my fault.

281
00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.939
It-- I mean. it was
actually entirely my fault.

282
00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.025
I don’t know.
My heart wasn’t in it.

283
00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:44.069
No?

284
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.696
What is your heart in?

285
00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.408
I like photography.

286
00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.619
Yeah? What do
you take pictures of?

287
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.579
Mostly. naked accountants.

288
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.583
I don’t know. just
people going about their lives.

289
00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.628
I-- I just-- I take pictures
on my phone sometimes for fun.

290
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:02.754
It’s not really...

291
00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.047
It sounds kinda
voyeuristic to me.

292
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.674
Oh. I am wanking. constantly.

293
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:12.013
Well. uh... I’m sorry if
I can seem kind of boring.

294
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:14.766
Thank you for
apologizing. I am quite bored.

295
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:17.519
There’s nothing
I can do about it.

296
00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.312
There are a couple of
things that you could do.

297
00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:20.605
What can I do?

298
00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.201
Maybe this is a mistake.

299
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.163
I have to warn you.
I’m really crap at dating.

300
00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:39.416
How bad could you be?

301
00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:49.968
Very bad.

302
00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.303
I’m not scared of you.

303
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.889
Well. maybe you should be.

304
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.297
Oh. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait! Hold...

305
00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:31.384
It’s. um...

306
00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.179
They’re-- they’re...

307
00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:35.764
They’re a...

308
00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:36.931
Is that like a...

309
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.184
Like a kinky thing or?

310
00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.603
No. No.

311
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:43.605
Okay.

312
00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.695
Uh. look.
the thing is Justin. I...

313
00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.030
-Hey.
-Um...

314
00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.576
Hey...

315
00:17:58.828 --> 00:17:59.829
It’s not...

316
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.916
a big...

317
00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.210
deal.

318
00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.902
-It’s okay.
-Yeah?

319
00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.693
Good morning.

320
00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:13.862
More like afternoon.

321
00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.321
You look so cute
when you’re asleep.

322
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.698
and I didn’t wanna wake you up.

323
00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.033
Not really used
to being called cute.

324
00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:20.785
No? Well. you are.

325
00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.996
When you let your guard down.

326
00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.414
Your place is weird.

327
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.293
Ah. it’s--
you know. it’s good weird.

328
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.503
What’s with all
the plastic plates and cups?

329
00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:31.880
You just move in?

330
00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.966
No. uh. just.
I-- I hate washing up.

331
00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:39.095
Well. in addition to the world’s
most expensive Danish.

332
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.347
I got you a little something.

333
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.142
Wow. Am I amazing in bed?

334
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.894
Yeah.

335
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.194
Oh. my God!

336
00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:58.781
Oh. no. That’s too much.

337
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.325
No. it’s not.

338
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.119
Wow!

339
00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.079
-You like it?
-Love it!

340
00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:06.247
Thank you.

341
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:12.170
Oh. um.
by the way. last night...

342
00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.755
I-- I never do that.

343
00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.089
No?

344
00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:16.257
No. I mean. never.

345
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:19.677
Well. I’m-- I’m glad you did.

346
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:22.138
You are...
you’re full of surprises.

347
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.266
The least of which is.
um. this whole situation.

348
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.851
You. uh. you wanna elaborate?

349
00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:28.770
Now that we know
each other better.

350
00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:32.273
Yeah. Um...

351
00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.859
You know what?
You don’t have to. I’m sorry.

352
00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:40.865
No! I will. Uh. it’s a new
treatment for this... thing.

353
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.283
You’re not gonna
die on me. are you?

354
00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.534
No. No. no. no.

355
00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.744
That’d be just
my luck. you know?

356
00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.621
I meet the most
amazing woman in the city

357
00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.206
and you got six months to live?

358
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.124
No. I’ve got. um...

359
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.711
an impulse control problem.

360
00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.838
And that helps
me to not have it.

361
00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.507
Like Tourette’s?

362
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.762
No. Um. just
tiny bit more intense.

363
00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:04.055
Okay.

364
00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:07.100
Uh. well. I mean.
have you tried meditation

365
00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:08.184
or something?

366
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.268
Yeah. sort of.

367
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:14.190
Yoga...

368
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:17.235
Medication...

369
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.779
Extreme sports...

370
00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.910
You know. I’ve tried
like. a whole lot of things.

371
00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:28.162
picked up lots of useless skills

372
00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:32.417
and. um. that’s
the thing that-- that helps.

373
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.545
Well. I don’t see
anything wrong with you.

374
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.016
Mm-mmm. No. no.
no. I gotta go to work.

375
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.308
Well. can’t
you say you’re sick?

376
00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.686
No. I can’t. Barry
will totally bust my balls.

377
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.062
Oh. okay. Well. no. leave--

378
00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.481
leave the balls exactly
as they are. they were good.

379
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:56.899
Um. but can’t you say

380
00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:58.234
that something came
up with another client?

381
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.069
Well. I only have one...

382
00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:02.405
and he pays for
my exclusivity. so...

383
00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:04.490
-Okay?
-Okay.

384
00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.492
Come to my place tonight.

385
00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.202
Yeah? I’ll cook.

386
00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:10.955
I’m a fucking ninja
with a piece of halibut.

387
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:17.587
Yes. yes. yes!

388
00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:32.268
I could feel this way

389
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.359
Touch as much you want

390
00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:41.611
-Oh. my God!
-No! It’s fine!

391
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:42.737
-It’s fine!
-What?

392
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.155
It’s fine. It’s fine! Relax.

393
00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:45.239
You’re early!

394
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:46.365
Yes. I was excited to see you!

395
00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:47.575
Why?

396
00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:48.993
Because you’re a genius.

397
00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:51.621
You’re a bald
and burnished genius.

398
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:52.747
I’m cured.

399
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.373
Oh. you saw him again?

400
00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:56.209
And. I had an impulse. but...

401
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:57.752
it wasn’t a
breaking his legs.

402
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.003
smash his face in. slamming--

403
00:22:59.087 --> 00:23:00.213
Actually. there
was a bit of slamming.

404
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:03.966
But it was warm
and romantic and...

405
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.718
and filthy.

406
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:07.220
This is progress.

407
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.514
Very good.

408
00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:10.973
Very good?

409
00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:12.350
It’s brilliant!

410
00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:14.018
Listen. I took the vest off.

411
00:23:14.102 --> 00:23:15.394
Wow! Wow.

412
00:23:15.478 --> 00:23:16.646
A couple more weeks.

413
00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:18.356
-I’m not even gonna need this.
-That’s great!

414
00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:20.274
But I think it’s
temporary euphoria.

415
00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:21.776
I can’t stop thinking about him.

416
00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:24.904
His hands. his face.
his hair smells really amazing--

417
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:26.030
Oh. my God! The penis!

418
00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.448
I almost called
you in the middle of it.

419
00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:29.617
It. like.
unfurled itself. like--

420
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.078
to ten times its length.
like-- like a travel umbrella!

421
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:33.871
-I’ve only ever heard of that.
-Yeah!

422
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:35.206
-Never actually seen it!
-No.

423
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:36.541
-Grower. Amazing!
-I wouldn’t know...

424
00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:38.376
Yeah. Wow.

425
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:40.920
I didn’t know those existed.

426
00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:42.421
Oh. and he’s
cooking me dinner tonight.

427
00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:44.757
-Stop it.
-Hmm. Fish.

428
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.260
Fish! But you don’t like fish.

429
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:49.095
No. but people change.

430
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:50.304
They do.
-I’ve changed.

431
00:23:50.388 --> 00:23:51.973
It’s true.
Okay. why don’t we sit down

432
00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:53.516
and let’s have
a little chat about this?

433
00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:55.560
-Because-- Okay. all right.
-Boring and snooze.

434
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:56.894
Because I want to celebrate!

435
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.396
Can we open
a bottle of something?

436
00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.565
No. it’s ten
o’clock in the morning.

437
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:01.816
Okay. you’re being a bad friend.

438
00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:04.360
I’m not your friend.
I’m your psychiatrist.

439
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.321
I finally want
to talk about dick.

440
00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:09.031
you should be salivating.

441
00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:12.118
Gross. No. look.
sit down. please. all right?

442
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.286
No. I don’t
need a session today.

443
00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:14.871
Yes. you do.
because you’re manic

444
00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.789
and it’s making
me incredibly anxious.

445
00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:18.416
-And I’m worried about you.
-Don’t be anxious.

446
00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:19.709
-I am though.
-I love you.

447
00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:21.711
Okay. Uh. love you too.

448
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:23.671
-I love you more!
- Oh. boy.

449
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.140
Hello?
-Justin?

450
00:25:16.224 --> 00:25:19.185
No. This is Detective Vicars.

451
00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:20.561
Homicide.

452
00:25:20.645 --> 00:25:22.647
-

453
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.526
But how do
you know it was murder?

454
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.153
His body was
found in a dumpster.

455
00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:31.072
with two gunshot
wounds to the head.

456
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:37.828
Were you together very long?

457
00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:41.624
Tonight was
gonna be our third date.

458
00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:45.378
He was-- was
gonna cook me dinner.

459
00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:48.256
Fish.

460
00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:49.507
Salmon?

461
00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:51.217
Halibut.

462
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.927
Hmm.

463
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.971
You know any of his friends.
family or coworkers?

464
00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:58.015
No. I-- I know
he’s an accountant.

465
00:25:58.099 --> 00:26:00.935
He... was an accountant.

466
00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:03.187
But he only had one client.

467
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:05.189
Some guy named Barry.

468
00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:06.524
We’re gonna find who did this.

469
00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:08.067
Let’s not give
the lady false hope.

470
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.694
Statistically. it’s unlikely.

471
00:26:09.777 --> 00:26:11.153
I’m not giving her anything.

472
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:12.613
I’m reassuring
her we’re gonna do our best.

473
00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:14.156
Some people prefer honesty.

474
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.241
Some people prefer compassion.

475
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:16.826
Can I see him?

476
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:18.244
No. Family only right now.

477
00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:19.620
Can I talk to his family?

478
00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:20.913
We haven’t been
able to find anyone yet.

479
00:26:20.997 --> 00:26:22.331
But then who’s
gonna mind if I see him?

480
00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:23.708
Policy’s gonna mind.

481
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:25.793
-Those are the rules.
- She loves rules.

482
00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:28.838
Look. we really are
very sorry. for your loss.

483
00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:31.882
-Aah!
-

484
00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:44.854
Sounds like
your guy was involved

485
00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.355
in some pretty sketchy business.

486
00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:49.775
Dodged a bullet or two.

487
00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:51.736
All right. listen.
Just give us a call.

488
00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:53.279
if you remember anything else.

489
00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:55.156
Thanks.

490
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.538
What the fuck-hell was that?

491
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:04.582
She was upset.

492
00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:06.625
She’s grieving. I’m-- I’m
just trying to comfort her.

493
00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:08.336
I think she’s angry.

494
00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:10.046
I don’t think so.

495
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:12.548
That’s why you like her.

496
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.675
You like ’em with
a little rage bottled up inside.

497
00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.385
Better in bed.

498
00:27:16.469 --> 00:27:19.055
until it blows up in
your stupid-ass face.

499
00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:23.225
"I’m a big strong policeman."

500
00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:26.812
"Let me embrace you. and
comfort your grieving vagina."

501
00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:29.982
I don’t
wanna comfort a vagina.

502
00:27:56.926 --> 00:28:01.263
It’s not a big deal.

503
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:28.374
Stop!

504
00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:30.209
You fixed me. now he’s dead!

505
00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:33.003
Ah! It’s not working.

506
00:28:33.087 --> 00:28:34.547
I’m going to get you a sedative.

507
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.215
Now. you have
to stop shocking yourself.

508
00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:38.300
Lindy? Lindy?

509
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.352
I’m not scared of you.

510
00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:04.785
Lindy?

511
00:29:06.537 --> 00:29:07.621
Lindy?

512
00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:12.209
Lindy?

513
00:29:13.127 --> 00:29:14.128
Where is it?

514
00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:16.380
You’re holding it.

515
00:29:20.593 --> 00:29:21.594
How do you feel?

516
00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:26.474
I want to crush
your skull with my bare hands.

517
00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:30.478
I’m sorry about Justin.

518
00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:34.231
I mean. they acted
like it was no big deal.

519
00:29:34.982 --> 00:29:35.983
Who?

520
00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:37.318
The police.

521
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:39.153
Well. don’t focus on
them. Focus on yourself.

522
00:29:39.236 --> 00:29:41.197
It’s obvious
they thought his boss

523
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.907
had something to do with it.

524
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.576
Which. I mean. of course.
Right? He only had one client.

525
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:46.911
That’s a bit weird. isn’t it?

526
00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:49.413
I am sure they’ll figure it out.

527
00:29:49.497 --> 00:29:50.748
Fuck them!

528
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:53.167
No. I need to
find out who did this.

529
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.294
I have to talk to Justin’s boss.

530
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:56.712
What if
you just took a moment.

531
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:57.796
-and you felt--
-What if

532
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.881
I just snapped your neck?

533
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:01.342
I’m gonna find
the fuckers who did this.

534
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:03.052
If you go down that path.

535
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.346
you are never.
ever going to get better.

536
00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:07.139
Fuck.

537
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:08.641
You’re gonna kill somebody.

538
00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:10.601
-You’re fucking right I am.
-Wait!

539
00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:11.810
I have to
tell you something--

540
00:30:11.894 --> 00:30:13.521
Look! Some people cry. Some
people drink.

541
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:16.524
Some people write
shit poetry. I hurt people.

542
00:30:16.607 --> 00:30:18.108
Might as well
put it to good use.

543
00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:40.756
Vicars.

544
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.508
Hi.
Detective Vicars?

545
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.009
I need to talk to you.

546
00:30:44.093 --> 00:30:48.180
I-- I think I have more
information but I’m scared.

547
00:30:48.264 --> 00:30:50.849
Can you come
meet me at my place?

548
00:30:50.933 --> 00:30:52.768
Yeah. Yeah.
we’ll be right there.

549
00:32:50.427 --> 00:32:51.970
Hello?

550
00:32:52.054 --> 00:32:55.057
Hi. Lindy.
it’s Detective Vicars.

551
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.183
Lindy?

552
00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:59.645
Hello Detective. You’re
angry. right?

553
00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:01.188
Why are you stealing evidence?

554
00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:03.190
Because I want to
find out what happened.

555
00:33:03.273 --> 00:33:04.775
That’s my job.

556
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:07.444
Uh-huh. How’s
that going for you?

557
00:33:07.528 --> 00:33:08.821
I found you. didn’t I?

558
00:33:08.904 --> 00:33:10.989
-What?
- My partner wants to bring you

559
00:33:11.073 --> 00:33:13.784
in for interfering with an
investigation. and robbery and

560
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:15.202
probably a whole
bunch of other stuff

561
00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:16.745
’cause she’s
ridiculously thorough.

562
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:19.498
But I wanted to give you the
chance to come in on your own

563
00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:21.375
and clear up this
misunderstanding.

564
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.419
Without all the. you know. jail.

565
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:24.837
She’s on her way up now.

566
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.214
-Fucking balls. Where are you?
-I’m parked out front.

567
00:33:27.297 --> 00:33:28.716
She’s not going
to shoot me. is she?

568
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.800
No. of course not.

569
00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:31.885
Freeze!
-Fuck!

570
00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:34.054
Then again. she might...

571
00:33:34.138 --> 00:33:35.681
So here’s what’s gonna happen.

572
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:38.058
You’re gonna put your arms over
your head. I’m gonna cuff you.

573
00:33:38.142 --> 00:33:39.893
I’m gonna take
you down to the station.

574
00:33:39.977 --> 00:33:42.104
-and then I’m gonna book you.
-What if I have other plans?

575
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:43.480
I’ll fucking shoot you.

576
00:33:43.564 --> 00:33:45.774
And then waste a bunch
of time writing up a report.

577
00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:48.026
instead of hunting
down your boyfriend’s killer.

578
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.737
Wasn’t actually
my boyfriend yet.

579
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.863
Commitment issues?

580
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:52.448
It was early days.

581
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:54.366
As if dating in
the city wasn’t hard enough.

582
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.285
You finally find a good man.

583
00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.579
and boom.
two bullets to the brain.

584
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.164
Your partner is a trip. Vicars.

585
00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:01.832
Hey. Nevin...

586
00:34:01.915 --> 00:34:03.292
Is that?

587
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:06.128
Are you fucking kidding me?

588
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.963
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

589
00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:18.849
Please don’t tell me.

590
00:34:18.932 --> 00:34:20.768
you just called
this murder suspect--

591
00:34:24.188 --> 00:34:25.689
Sorry. Having a bad day.

592
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:27.941
Freeze!
-I didn’t kill him!

593
00:34:36.033 --> 00:34:38.368
-

594
00:34:38.452 --> 00:34:40.537
Hello?
- Oh. Hi. Detective.

595
00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:43.874
Lindy. is everything
okay up there? Is Nevin okay?

596
00:34:43.957 --> 00:34:45.793
Little
busy at the moment.

597
00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:47.127
Busy doing what?

598
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:51.340
Remembering
how to drive stick.

599
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:52.424
What?

600
00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:58.472
-Stupid motherfucker.
-Ow. ow. ow.

601
00:34:59.515 --> 00:35:01.809
Holy shit! I know that sound.

602
00:35:01.892 --> 00:35:03.811
That’s a McLaren 600LT Spider?

603
00:35:03.894 --> 00:35:05.270
It’s a car.

604
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:10.025
A really fast one.

605
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:12.194
Are you still on the phone
with that kooky cuntcicle?

606
00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:19.326
Fucking go! Go! Go!

607
00:35:23.539 --> 00:35:25.874
Where did you learn to drive?
You even trying to catch her?

608
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.209
I’m flooring it!

609
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:28.836
Guys. it’s
quite hard to concentrate

610
00:35:28.919 --> 00:35:30.087
with you two bickering.

611
00:35:38.095 --> 00:35:39.930
Oh!

612
00:35:40.973 --> 00:35:42.766
-Oh. crap!
-

613
00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:46.186
-Come on. Lindy.
- Ooh.

614
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.146
I think I’m starting to get
the hang of this stick shift.

615
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.607
Oh. shit. Reverse!

616
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.161
Damn it!

617
00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:08.500
Lindy. please stay on the phone.
I’m trying to help you.

618
00:36:08.584 --> 00:36:11.003
Okay. I really
have to concentrate now.

619
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:12.963
so. it’s been
really nice catching up.

620
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:16.049
No. wait! You go
through with this and you’re--

621
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:17.593
You’re on your own.

622
00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:18.677
Same as always.

623
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.471
Lindy!

624
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:24.182
Damn it!

625
00:36:24.266 --> 00:36:25.434
Shit!

626
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:33.191
I’m trying to help you. You’re
going to get somebody killed.

627
00:36:33.275 --> 00:36:35.360
If you think I had anything to
do with Justin’s death.

628
00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.070
then you’re shitter at your
jobs than I thought.

629
00:36:37.154 --> 00:36:38.280
We don’t think you killed
Justin...

630
00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:39.364
Speak for yourself!

631
00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:47.873
Whoa! Argh!

632
00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:51.043
Get ’em!
- Yeah!

633
00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:27.079
Ah! The fuck...

634
00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:29.790
-I’m not doing it.
-Don’t bitch out!

635
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:30.958
Fine! Fine! Fine!

636
00:37:41.718 --> 00:37:43.178
-Fuck.
-

637
00:38:11.373 --> 00:38:12.708
If you
can’t ascertain the cause.

638
00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:14.376
of the outbreak.
then you have no idea.

639
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.128
how many zombies
you’ll have to kill over time.

640
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:18.380
A lightsaber
would solve both problems.

641
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.924
We specified
a real-world scenario.

642
00:38:21.008 --> 00:38:23.218
Yeah. a real zombie apocalypse.

643
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.303
Besides. there’s no way
to recharge the lightsaber’s

644
00:38:25.387 --> 00:38:28.056
Diatium power cell
after it ran out.

645
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.267
Diatium power cells
don’t run out of energy.

646
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.518
They recycle it.

647
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.064
Who’s in charge around here?

648
00:38:36.857 --> 00:38:39.026
I’m-- I-- I’m the manager.

649
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:40.235
If you’re the manager

650
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.820
then you’re the last person.
I want to talk to.

651
00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:43.822
I need someone who actually
knows what they’re doing.

652
00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:45.615
Who’s the biggest
geek you’ve got in this place?

653
00:38:46.783 --> 00:38:47.868
-Andy.
-Andy.

654
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:48.952
Andy.

655
00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:02.049
Okay. so what? Forget
your password or something?

656
00:39:02.132 --> 00:39:03.175
No.

657
00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:05.052
It’s more. the man
I loved was murdered

658
00:39:05.135 --> 00:39:06.803
and I stole
his phone from the police.

659
00:39:06.887 --> 00:39:08.180
and now I’ve got to
track down the bad guy

660
00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:10.307
before they do. so
I can kill the shit out of them.

661
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.184
Oh! Cool.

662
00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:19.399
And... we’re in.

663
00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:20.525
Oh. wow. You’re good.

664
00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:22.069
Obviously.

665
00:39:22.152 --> 00:39:25.238
Not much here. no
history. This must be a burner.

666
00:39:25.322 --> 00:39:26.823
Your boyfriend
a drug dealer or something?

667
00:39:26.907 --> 00:39:28.158
No. accountant.

668
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:31.703
I mean. he wasn’t--
We weren’t... yet. You know.

669
00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:34.372
Yeah. Right. right. I get it.

670
00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:36.583
-I don’t.
-Did your mouth just fart. Doug?

671
00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:37.834
Sorry.

672
00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:40.629
The last seven calls.

673
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:43.340
came from
an abandoned building downtown.

674
00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:45.509
-Shady.
-What does that mean?

675
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.511
I’m not sure.
Lets see who owns it.

676
00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.892
Barry Kasparzki. Whoa!

677
00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:56.353
FBI files showed
ties to arms dealers.

678
00:39:57.312 --> 00:39:58.313
Holy shit!

679
00:39:58.396 --> 00:39:59.856
That’s the guy.

680
00:40:01.108 --> 00:40:02.109
How much do I owe you?

681
00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:04.361
Trust me. you can’t afford me.

682
00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:05.529
Thanks.

683
00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:07.739
Oh.

684
00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:12.554
Boys. boys. boys!

685
00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:13.972
Whatever it is
you’re fighting over.

686
00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.599
I’m sure we can all talk it out.

687
00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:16.933
Money...

688
00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:19.477
Yeah. You know. like bets?

689
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:21.646
Oh! Duh.

690
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.273
Is it too late to put
a dollar on the other one?

691
00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:24.524
Just ’cause
you’re a bit of a bleeder

692
00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:25.775
and you drop
your left when you hook.

693
00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:27.027
What’s going on?

694
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.405
Oh. are you Barry? I guess so.

695
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:31.656
Just. you seem like.

696
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.991
you have
the biggest dick in here. so...

697
00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:34.075
What do you want?

698
00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:35.577
Well. I wanted
to pick your brains.

699
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.454
about the phone
calls you have with the...

700
00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:39.289
accountant that works for you.

701
00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:40.415
Did you kill him?

702
00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:43.627
What are you? Cop? Fed?

703
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.545
Oh no. girlfriend.

704
00:41:45.629 --> 00:41:46.922
I mean. I say girlfriend.

705
00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:48.965
We went on.
like. two dates but...

706
00:41:49.049 --> 00:41:51.468
you know. I was really
hopeful. I was crossing fingers.

707
00:41:51.551 --> 00:41:52.719
I didn’t kill any accountant.

708
00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:54.262
-But you know who did.
-Probably!

709
00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:55.722
Well. amazing!

710
00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:58.058
I mean. that saves me
a massive headache. Barry!

711
00:41:58.141 --> 00:41:59.684
You’re a sweetheart.

712
00:41:59.768 --> 00:42:01.561
I didn’t say I’d tell you.

713
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:03.563
Oh. seriously? Are you gonna
make me go through the whole.

714
00:42:03.647 --> 00:42:05.982
face-stomping.
bone-breaking routine?

715
00:42:07.442 --> 00:42:08.526
Okay. fine.

716
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:10.570
I tell you what.

717
00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:12.614
How about I beat
three of your best guys.

718
00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:14.241
and you tell me the name?

719
00:42:14.324 --> 00:42:15.992
Sounds like fun.

720
00:42:16.076 --> 00:42:18.703
You. you and you.

721
00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:21.539
But not three in a row.

722
00:42:21.623 --> 00:42:23.041
All at the same time.

723
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:25.210
I like a man who challenges me.

724
00:42:27.254 --> 00:42:29.714
Okay. so what
are the. like. rules?

725
00:42:29.798 --> 00:42:31.132
No rules.

726
00:42:32.384 --> 00:42:33.385
Oh.

727
00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:35.887
All right.

728
00:42:50.986 --> 00:42:52.570
Oh!

729
00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:17.637
Aah!

730
00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:24.894
-

731
00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:26.396
Lucky guess.

732
00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:33.945
That’s enough!

733
00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:35.613
Fight’s over!

734
00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:38.825
Everybody out!

735
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:40.702
If he had a bigger Adam’s apple.

736
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:41.786
this’d be really working for me.

737
00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:58.136
You don’t mind. do you?

738
00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:00.472
I’m just a bit
parched after that.

739
00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:04.100
Oh! I needed that.

740
00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:06.269
Okay. you were gonna
tell me who killed Justin?

741
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:11.232
Those men back there.

742
00:44:11.316 --> 00:44:13.109
they work for me.

743
00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:16.029
they respect me and
they pay tribute to me.

744
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:17.697
They do this.

745
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:20.533
because they know.
that I am a man of my word.

746
00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:21.743
Now...

747
00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:25.622
Business like this.
I like to keep private.

748
00:44:25.705 --> 00:44:27.332
’Cause the truth is.

749
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:30.502
all that I have is
because of one thing.

750
00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:32.504
and one thing only.

751
00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:33.797
And that is...

752
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.800
that I have never
been a man of my word.

753
00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:41.679
So. if you’ll excuse me.

754
00:44:41.763 --> 00:44:44.182
I don’t like to
get business on my suit.

755
00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:45.266
Okay.

756
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.726
What is it about gross old men

757
00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.354
always underestimating women?

758
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.862
Interesting ball color.

759
00:44:57.946 --> 00:44:59.364
What we calling that? Ox-blood?

760
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:00.824
Claret?

761
00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:03.451
Just like a woman.
straight for the nuts!

762
00:45:03.535 --> 00:45:05.161
No. I only do
that when I’m in hurry.

763
00:45:05.245 --> 00:45:07.539
Although. evolution hasn’t
really been kind to you guys.

764
00:45:07.622 --> 00:45:10.125
putting the on-off switch.
dangling around in front

765
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.085
for any predator
to come by and flick.

766
00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:14.003
Now. who killed him?

767
00:45:14.087 --> 00:45:15.088
I don’t know.

768
00:45:15.171 --> 00:45:16.339
Don’t be silly!

769
00:45:16.423 --> 00:45:17.882
Gareth Fizel!

770
00:45:17.966 --> 00:45:19.300
Gareth Fizel!

771
00:45:19.384 --> 00:45:20.844
Yeah. he’s my boss.

772
00:45:20.927 --> 00:45:22.929
Why would
he kill his accountant?

773
00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:24.681
Maybe he was skimming the books.

774
00:45:24.764 --> 00:45:26.850
Look. even the government.

775
00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:29.185
ain’t dumb
enough to go after Fizel.

776
00:45:29.269 --> 00:45:31.479
Are you really that stupid?

777
00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:34.315
You know what? I think
I am exactly that stupid.

778
00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:35.942
-

779
00:45:45.368 --> 00:45:46.828
You enjoying that?

780
00:45:47.787 --> 00:45:50.457
Mmm. Background check came in.

781
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.251
Your li’l girlfriend.
she’s got a history of violence.

782
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:55.712
Assault. Harassment.

783
00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:58.882
Interesting job history
too. Classified-type shit.

784
00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:01.634
So she’s got skills
and an anger issue.

785
00:46:01.718 --> 00:46:02.927
Not a great combo.

786
00:46:03.011 --> 00:46:04.596
I still don’t think.
she’s the type to blow

787
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:05.680
her boyfriend’s head off.

788
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.432
Hope not. or else you’re next.

789
00:46:09.017 --> 00:46:11.561
She’s got a short fuse.
Doesn’t make her a murderer.

790
00:46:11.644 --> 00:46:13.688
That’s what happens
when you don’t follow protocol.

791
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.691
Sometimes common
sense trumps protocol.

792
00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:20.570
Nah. I’m good being the superior
one in this relationship.

793
00:46:22.572 --> 00:46:24.365
Wha-- Hey! What
am I supposed to eat?

794
00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:27.785
I’ll see what I can swipe from
the gunshot victim next door.

795
00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:32.290
Always taking such good
care of me. Thank you. partner.

796
00:46:37.754 --> 00:46:39.631
Aw. allergic to latex?

797
00:46:39.714 --> 00:46:41.257
You’re no fun.

798
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:45.345
Wow! Impressive
urine output. Good for you.

799
00:46:45.428 --> 00:46:46.763
Oh. don’t bother.

800
00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.264
I’ll run away and
you’ll get yourself all

801
00:46:48.348 --> 00:46:50.475
emasculated trying to catch me.

802
00:46:50.558 --> 00:46:51.935
Here. I did get a bouquet.

803
00:46:52.018 --> 00:46:53.853
but I gave it to
this woman in the elevator.

804
00:46:55.271 --> 00:46:57.190
Just been diagnosed
with something horrible

805
00:46:57.273 --> 00:46:58.775
and couldn’t stop
crying. It was really awkward.

806
00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:01.027
Glad to see you’re all right.

807
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.196
I wanted to say thank
you for warning me and--

808
00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:04.489
I wasn’t warning you.

809
00:47:04.572 --> 00:47:06.449
I was giving you a chance
to do the right thing.

810
00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:08.368
Well. thank you for
giving me the chance.

811
00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:11.162
Look. I found
out who killed Justin.

812
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:12.664
Who?

813
00:47:12.747 --> 00:47:13.998
Gareth Fizel.

814
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:16.960
You got any proof?

815
00:47:17.043 --> 00:47:19.212
Well. obviously
not the sort of person

816
00:47:19.295 --> 00:47:21.005
who gives a fuck about proof.

817
00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:23.007
What do you know about him?

818
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:24.425
Billionaire recluse

819
00:47:24.509 --> 00:47:26.344
with his fingers in a bunch
of different illegal pies.

820
00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:28.054
He’s pretty much untouchable.

821
00:47:28.137 --> 00:47:29.305
Oh. I’m gonna touch him.

822
00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:31.015
Hard.

823
00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:33.268
And a lot. And not in
a way he’s gonna enjoy.

824
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.520
Where can I find him?

825
00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:37.438
Why you doing this?

826
00:47:37.522 --> 00:47:40.483
Is this Justin really
worth you risking your life for?

827
00:47:40.567 --> 00:47:42.819
Yeah. it was early
days. I didn’t know him.

828
00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:44.862
I didn’t know half
the shit he was caught up in.

829
00:47:44.946 --> 00:47:47.699
But I do know.
he was a decent guy.

830
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:49.492
He didn’t
deserve to die like that.

831
00:47:49.576 --> 00:47:50.577
Nobody does.

832
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.036
Well. no. but...

833
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.539
Most people make me
want to run away screaming.

834
00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:56.708
or snap their fingers
off. He was...

835
00:47:57.667 --> 00:47:58.918
He was nice.

836
00:47:59.002 --> 00:48:01.212
He was-- He was really nice.

837
00:48:01.296 --> 00:48:02.839
There’s lots of
nice guys out there.

838
00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:04.299
Yeah.

839
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:06.175
They’re all frightened of me.

840
00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:07.885
He wanted to cook me fish.

841
00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.558
The Imperion Tower. Downtown.

842
00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:15.852
Thank you.

843
00:48:15.935 --> 00:48:17.395
I can’t let you go there.

844
00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:19.814
You’re not in a great
position to stop me. are you?

845
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.107
But I am.

846
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:24.027
Get back!

847
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:34.579
Get back here right now!

848
00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:54.390
Stop!

849
00:48:57.393 --> 00:48:59.228
Sorry.

850
00:48:59.312 --> 00:49:00.647
Bitch. get back here!

851
00:49:53.408 --> 00:49:54.409
Fuck.

852
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.541
Shh!

853
00:50:05.795 --> 00:50:06.796
Shh!

854
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:10.550
Shh!

855
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.561
Shh!

856
00:50:27.442 --> 00:50:28.735
Ow!

857
00:50:28.818 --> 00:50:29.819
Fuck!

858
00:50:35.158 --> 00:50:36.576
Shh! Stop it. Stop it.

859
00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:40.955
Freeze!

860
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:44.417
Don’t move. don’t
breathe. don’t fucking fart!

861
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.543
Oh. come on.

862
00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:46.794
You’re not
gonna start shit in here.

863
00:50:46.878 --> 00:50:47.920
I will shoot you.

864
00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:49.839
Put the gun down.

865
00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:51.174
Why would I do that?

866
00:50:51.257 --> 00:50:52.550
Because I want you to be ready.

867
00:50:52.633 --> 00:50:54.010
Ready for what?

868
00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:55.970
This!

869
00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:58.848
-Catch!
-

870
00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:02.727
Freeze!

871
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.103
Don’t you dare!

872
00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:06.272
Don’t do it.

873
00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:07.523
-Seriously?
-I trust you!

874
00:51:12.528 --> 00:51:13.613
Aah!

875
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.907
Oh.

876
00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:02.870
Can I help you?

877
00:52:02.954 --> 00:52:05.373
Gareth Fizel.

878
00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:07.458
There’s no one
here by that name.

879
00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:08.668
Okay.

880
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:10.253
It’s gonna be a lot
less painful for you.

881
00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:11.921
if you just point me
in the right direction.

882
00:52:12.004 --> 00:52:13.005
Good evening.

883
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:15.925
Can I be of assistance?

884
00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:19.053
Mr. Delacroix. this woman...

885
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:21.514
is asking for a Mr. Fizel.

886
00:52:21.597 --> 00:52:23.307
And she threatened me.

887
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:26.435
You’re fired.

888
00:52:26.519 --> 00:52:27.520
For what?

889
00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:29.105
Your tone. Miss?

890
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:32.024
Right this way.

891
00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:39.824
That was some
pretty epic dick swinging.

892
00:53:03.055 --> 00:53:04.140
That’s strange.
I would’ve thought.

893
00:53:04.223 --> 00:53:06.017
the big cheese
would be on the top floor.

894
00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:09.186
He is.

895
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.271
-Aah!
-

896
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.653
Ow!

897
00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:22.533
Clean blow to my brachial
plexus nerve group. Good one.

898
00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:26.412
Um...

899
00:53:26.495 --> 00:53:28.706
You must be Security.

900
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:31.250
unless this is some
really fucked up date.

901
00:53:31.334 --> 00:53:32.627
Head of. And you are?

902
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.045
About to pee my pants.

903
00:53:34.128 --> 00:53:36.631
I had. like. four
Red Bulls on the way here.

904
00:53:36.714 --> 00:53:38.799
Is that what
the drain in the floor is for?

905
00:53:40.259 --> 00:53:41.761
What are these for?

906
00:53:41.844 --> 00:53:43.804
That is a really
bad idea to take those.

907
00:53:43.888 --> 00:53:46.307
-I need them.
-What for?

908
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:47.934
A bad heart.

909
00:53:48.017 --> 00:53:50.061
Well. they’re mine now.

910
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:51.729
Why are you here?

911
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:52.897
I need to see your boss.

912
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.273
Regarding what?

913
00:53:54.357 --> 00:53:55.608
He killed Justin.

914
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:56.734
Justin who?

915
00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:58.653
His accountant.

916
00:53:58.736 --> 00:54:00.571
Why would
he have killed your Justin?

917
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:03.658
Oh. I don’t know.
Boring everyday. bean counter

918
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:05.993
who’s cooking the books
for a shady arms dealer.

919
00:54:06.077 --> 00:54:08.537
suddenly assassinated
and tossed in a dumpster.

920
00:54:08.621 --> 00:54:11.290
Sounds like he had
information to disclose.

921
00:54:11.374 --> 00:54:13.584
Seemed like a solid lead.

922
00:54:13.668 --> 00:54:15.628
I mean. that and Barry told me.

923
00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:18.506
Are you a relation
of the deceased?

924
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:20.675
No. I was...

925
00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:23.844
-Not. we were...
-I see.

926
00:54:23.928 --> 00:54:25.513
-Do you?
-No.

927
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:27.515
Nor do I desire to.

928
00:54:27.598 --> 00:54:30.977
I am going to give you a chance
to vacate the premises.

929
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.937
-peacefully.
-

930
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.480
What if I don’t?

931
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:37.900
You will find out what
the drainage system is for.

932
00:54:37.984 --> 00:54:40.903
And I will be keeping those.

933
00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.457
-

934
00:55:09.724 --> 00:55:11.183
My life vest...

935
00:55:14.353 --> 00:55:16.022
I need my vest.

936
00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:05.946
Apologies for the disturbance.

937
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.656
We’ve had a visitor. a woman.

938
00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:10.701
She’s peculiar.

939
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.205
I need to get out of the car.

940
00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:18.501
Can you let me out of the car?

941
00:56:18.584 --> 00:56:21.170
Look. miss. I don’t
want to seem overly familiar.

942
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:22.421
but I gotta take you home.

943
00:56:22.505 --> 00:56:24.465
Unlock this door and let me out!

944
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.384
Asking about an accountant.

945
00:56:29.678 --> 00:56:31.138
A concern?

946
00:56:32.306 --> 00:56:33.891
Let me out of
the car for your sake!

947
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.559
-Miss!
-Let me out!

948
00:56:35.643 --> 00:56:37.019
Let me out!

949
00:56:37.103 --> 00:56:38.646
I wasn’t sure
who may have been aware.

950
00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:41.273
of her presence
here. so I opted to let her go.

951
00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:46.362
But enough of
a concern to bother me with.

952
00:56:46.445 --> 00:56:48.364
-

953
00:56:57.039 --> 00:56:58.207
I’m sorry.

954
00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.416
I’m sorry!

955
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.552
More like an unknown variable.

956
00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:15.099
You know... I don’t
like unknown variables.

957
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:16.433
Deal with her.

958
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:28.445
Please help me?

959
00:57:28.529 --> 00:57:29.905
Oh. fuck!

960
00:57:30.656 --> 00:57:32.700
What are you doing here?

961
00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:34.493
I lost my device.

962
00:57:34.577 --> 00:57:36.954
Do you have another
here? I really need it. Please?

963
00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:41.792
What happened to the lamp?

964
00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:44.378
I figured. if things
got really bad. I could

965
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:45.796
bite down on both ends.

966
00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:48.174
Don’t do that.

967
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:56.932
Sorry.

968
00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:59.643
Thanks.

969
00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:02.104
Have you seen
that movie Old Yeller?

970
00:58:02.188 --> 00:58:03.355
Uh. yeah. It’s a classic.

971
00:58:03.439 --> 00:58:05.691
I’ve never seen it.
but I know how it ends.

972
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:08.861
So if I... try anything.

973
00:58:09.737 --> 00:58:10.738
kill me.

974
00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:18.329
If I make this thing for you.

975
00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:19.830
will you stop
going after this guy?

976
00:58:22.249 --> 00:58:23.667
No.

977
00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:26.295
But I can promise more
innocent people won’t get hurt

978
00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:27.546
along the way.

979
00:58:29.798 --> 00:58:30.799
Okay.

980
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.556
Do you want some Chinese food?

981
00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.684
There’s Kung Pao chicken
and sweet and sour... something.

982
00:58:40.768 --> 00:58:43.604
and some... egg
rolls and all that.

983
00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:45.105
You should eat something.

984
00:58:45.189 --> 00:58:46.941
Don’t touch
the shrimp fried rice.

985
00:58:47.942 --> 00:58:50.027
-That’s mine.
-

986
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.199
I’ll get the vest.

987
01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.918
Je-- Jesus!
What are you doing?

988
01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:31.420
I’m hiding from
the beat cops down the street.

989
01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:32.504
What are you doing?

990
01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.131
Is sitting outside my apartment.

991
01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.050
some kind of police foreplay?
Are you wearing my knickers?

992
01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.134
I’m doing my job.

993
01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.510
Oh.

994
01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:41.430
I see we’ve taken down
another major drug kingpin.

995
01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:45.059
He got sent home from school
for setting the class pet free.

996
01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:46.560
Hmm. Hamster?

997
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.104
Rabbit. Hey. listen to me.

998
01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:51.940
There’s some pretty nasty guys
in the hospital. you know. and

999
01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:54.026
their description of
the deranged psycho

1000
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.235
who put them there matches you.

1001
01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.946
What? Come on. Little old me?

1002
01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.073
How could you possibly think

1003
01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:00.240
I could do anything like that?

1004
01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.242
Don’t fuck
around with me. Lindy.

1005
01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:05.371
Okay. but not now.
I need you to look after this.

1006
01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:06.538
I’m not dumping
evidence for you!

1007
01:01:06.622 --> 01:01:08.123
I’m not asking you to.

1008
01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:10.376
Look. I’m-- I’m
giving you the chance

1009
01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.710
to turn yourself in here.

1010
01:01:11.794 --> 01:01:14.463
Okay. I will! Just not yet.

1011
01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:16.715
Hey. listen to me.

1012
01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:19.218
Fizel’s not some
dickbag gangster. okay?

1013
01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:20.386
He’s going to be looking for you

1014
01:01:20.469 --> 01:01:22.012
and he’s going to kill you.

1015
01:01:22.096 --> 01:01:23.931
Right. Well. he already tried.

1016
01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.474
I think someone has
been in my apartment--

1017
01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:27.184
Right. that’s it.

1018
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.353
-It ain’t your choice anymore.
-No. no. no. no. no.

1019
01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:31.772
That’s a very
bad idea. I’ve got...

1020
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.399
this condition. Okay?

1021
01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:36.443
It makes me snap. I can’t
control it and I hurt people.

1022
01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:38.946
I wear this thing.
that gives me electric shocks.

1023
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.531
so that I can stop it happening.

1024
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:42.491
But. really. I really
don’t want to hurt you

1025
01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.618
or anybody else.

1026
01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:46.703
I don’t think you’d hurt me.

1027
01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:48.455
-No?
-No.

1028
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:51.083
Would you leave
me on my own with him?

1029
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.294
-Yeah.
-Bollocks!

1030
01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.130
Well. I don’t think
you’d hurt him either.

1031
01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.297
You sure?

1032
01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:01.093
What that thing feel like?

1033
01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:09.143
Come on?

1034
01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.440
-What are you--
-Here.

1035
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.028
-

1036
01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.410
Okay. you know
what that tells me?

1037
01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.537
I’m way more
screwed up than you thought.

1038
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.789
No. No. it tells me
that you’d rather hurt yourself

1039
01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:32.082
than somebody else.

1040
01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.127
Nevin says
I treat you different

1041
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.378
because you’re a woman.

1042
01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:37.838
She says...

1043
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:38.922
I’m going easy on you.

1044
01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.757
Is she right?

1045
01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.885
I treat you different
because you are different.

1046
01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:53.395
Nobody is looking for me now.

1047
01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:54.730
Lindy!

1048
01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.067
Whoa!

1049
01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:00.444
What’s that?

1050
01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:01.987
Dad?

1051
01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:04.281
fuck!

1052
01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.044
Lindy. listen to me!

1053
01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.046
I’m a little
busy at the moment.

1054
01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.173
Look. Lindy I don’t
wanna play games anymore.

1055
01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.509
You have to stop
looking for Justin’s killer.

1056
01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:24.718
You’re gonna get hurt.

1057
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.720
I know what you’re capable of.

1058
01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.138
I read all
about it in your file--

1059
01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:30.390
Okay. Are you done looking me up
on some bullshit database?

1060
01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:31.934
’Cause. listen. Detective.

1061
01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.353
I’m gonna do what I need to do.

1062
01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.438
Lindy I don’t wanna
see you wind up dead.

1063
01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:37.856
Just let us do our job.

1064
01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.067
So. what?

1065
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.945
Does that mean you are gonna
go in and arrest Fizel?

1066
01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:45.155
Yes. thought not.

1067
01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:20.649
Fuck.

1068
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.572
I was hoping to see you.

1069
01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:52.264
You like lobster?

1070
01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:58.270
Uh. I always thought
it was overrated and overpriced.

1071
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.398
Most people don’t realize

1072
01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:06.528
that lobster’s belong in
the same biological phylum

1073
01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:08.030
as cockroaches.

1074
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:14.870
They are both anthropods
with segmented bodies.

1075
01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:19.416
They both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs.

1076
01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.461
Even their meat is the same.

1077
01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.963
Lobsters must be boiled alive.

1078
01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:27.299
Cockroaches poisoned.

1079
01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.468
Wow.

1080
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:33.180
Ugly and boring.
What a winning combination.

1081
01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.098
What the fuck has
this got to do with me?

1082
01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:38.018
You are an odd specimen.

1083
01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:45.734
Not sure what. uh.
phylum you belong in.

1084
01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.277
Me neither.

1085
01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:49.946
That’s something my therapist
and I are really delving in to.

1086
01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:53.200
I understand
you are here to kill me.

1087
01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:56.536
Something about an accountant?

1088
01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:00.749
Your... boyfriend?

1089
01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:04.503
We hadn’t put a label on
it. but he was pretty special.

1090
01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:06.755
I kill a lot of people.

1091
01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:11.468
I suppose some of them
may be accountants. I’m...

1092
01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.182
I’m sorry I killed yours.

1093
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:18.642
Well. apology not accepted--

1094
01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.185
You creepy fuck.

1095
01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:22.521
Rude...

1096
01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:30.195
You are certainly
a... a rare species.

1097
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:36.076
I’m glad I took this
opportunity to get one good.

1098
01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:38.745
long. hard look at you.

1099
01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:41.915
Okay. but can you do it--

1100
01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:50.090
Without.

1101
01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.718
whacking me on
the head this time.

1102
01:06:52.801 --> 01:06:53.802
Fuck.

1103
01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:57.180
Fuck.

1104
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:00.851
Balls!

1105
01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.936
Fuck balls indeed.

1106
01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:05.856
I’m getting the feeling

1107
01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:08.316
there’s no cookie
and juice after this.

1108
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.609
Not for you.

1109
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.194
Wait. wait. wait!

1110
01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:13.155
Justin...

1111
01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:15.449
Did you pull the trigger?

1112
01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:20.036
No. I didn’t.
Though I wish I had.

1113
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:25.000
This is going
to take a sec so...

1114
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.836
-Sit back. relax.
-Fuck!

1115
01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.671
-Enjoy the ride.
-What are you doing to me?

1116
01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:33.717
Do you know what
exsanguination means?

1117
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.762
The drainage of one’s blood.

1118
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.141
-

1119
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:43.310
Aah!

1120
01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:10.545
Aah!

1121
01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:13.507
Aah!

1122
01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:35.612
I have a few questions.

1123
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.615
How do I get to Fizel?

1124
01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.301
Hey! Where
do you think you’re going?

1125
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.596
Get ready to die. you sick fuck!

1126
01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:46.451
Justin!

1127
01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.662
Bravo. Well done!

1128
01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.666
You know.
I gotta admit Lindy. uh...

1129
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:53.833
Right toward the end there I...

1130
01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:55.835
I didn’t think you had it in ya.

1131
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.837
So. my apologies.

1132
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.256
I decided to take
care of Fizel myself.

1133
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:03.843
What are you covered in?

1134
01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.220
Is it that time of the month?

1135
01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:07.931
But you...

1136
01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:11.184
I saw you. How?

1137
01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.310
The guy in the casket?

1138
01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:14.312
No.

1139
01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:16.189
Aah. some bum off the street.

1140
01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.440
Jesus Christ!

1141
01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:20.819
Yeah. I just paid
off the coroner. you know?

1142
01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:22.988
Why?

1143
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.948
I had to
get Fizel out of the way.

1144
01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:27.200
But the CIA can’t
operate on US soil.

1145
01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:29.411
Even the government.

1146
01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.538
wouldn’t be dumb
enough to go after him.

1147
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.289
Exactly.

1148
01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:34.958
Yeah! I needed someone
from the outside. you know?

1149
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.752
Someone to draw
the attention away from myself.

1150
01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:40.338
Someone who couldn’t
be traced back to me.

1151
01:11:40.422 --> 01:11:41.756
So you chose me?

1152
01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.384
Why?

1153
01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:47.053
A glowing
recommendation from Dr. Munchin.

1154
01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:48.430
I mean. who do you think funds

1155
01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.306
his batshit crazy experiments?

1156
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.808
But see. I...

1157
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:54.644
I knew you
were something else. Yeah.

1158
01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:57.022
My little kamikaze K-9.

1159
01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.399
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1160
01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:02.277
Well. in the
Second World War. uh...

1161
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.279
they strapped bombs to dogs

1162
01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:06.448
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks.

1163
01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:07.824
Right?

1164
01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.659
The puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat

1165
01:12:09.743 --> 01:12:12.579
or something. but they got
detonated into dog-burger.

1166
01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:13.955
Yeah.

1167
01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:15.582
So I just had
to figure out what treats

1168
01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:19.335
I needed to use
to train you to take out Fizel.

1169
01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:21.254
And if you failed or
got killed in the process.

1170
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.131
well. you know? Cost me nothing.

1171
01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.133
That’s why you were perfect.

1172
01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.551
Where’s my car by the way?

1173
01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:29.054
Who the fuck are you?

1174
01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:30.346
Who am I?

1175
01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.308
I’m the only one
keeping this old shitbag

1176
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:34.851
from killing innocent people!

1177
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.103
Fizel was an asset
that became a liability.

1178
01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:38.271
Everybody wanted him dead.

1179
01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.397
but nobody can touch him.

1180
01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:43.151
And you think this masochistic

1181
01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:46.446
piece of shit
was ever gonna stop?

1182
01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:51.117
Not so untouchable
anymore. are ya handsome?

1183
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:52.535
Huh?

1184
01:12:52.619 --> 01:12:55.080
You lowlife piece of shit.

1185
01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:57.040
I’m gonna fucking kill you.

1186
01:12:57.123 --> 01:13:02.170
You could try. Or
we just... fuck instead.

1187
01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:17.519
What? We had fun. right?

1188
01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:20.855
I mean.
you did all this for me?

1189
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.109
You must really be into me.

1190
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.154
What the fuck?

1191
01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.739
Was that too strong for ya?

1192
01:13:29.823 --> 01:13:33.451
Oh. sorry. I did a bit of
tinkering.

1193
01:13:33.535 --> 01:13:35.745
-Ow!
-

1194
01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:37.622
You know what though?
It’s gonna turn out to be.

1195
01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:39.707
a really beautiful story. Lindy.

1196
01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.584
-Desperate. little

1197
01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:43.753
broken princess

1198
01:13:43.837 --> 01:13:46.714
avenges the death
of her lover and then...

1199
01:13:46.798 --> 01:13:48.216
takes her own life.

1200
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:57.642
Oops.

1201
01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.147
You know what’s funny?

1202
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.107
I thought you’d be
harder to crack. I really did!

1203
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.860
’Cause you seemed
pretty messed up.

1204
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:10.405
You know. in-- in
an interesting way. but...

1205
01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:11.990
No. you’re easy.

1206
01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:19.539
Well. it turns out all
you needed was to be fucked.

1207
01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:46.357
-You know what?
-

1208
01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:48.109
It is actually
that time of the month.

1209
01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:51.070
Unlucky for you. fuckface.

1210
01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:55.658
What the fuck is this?

1211
01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.619
A parting gift!

1212
01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:03.499
Eat shit!

1213
01:15:39.953 --> 01:15:41.079
I’m sorry.

1214
01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.956
-You backstabbing fuck!
-Wait. wait. wait!

1215
01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.999
I had no idea what
they were going to do with you.

1216
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.627
I’m assuming that both
Justin and Fizel are dead?

1217
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.128
Uh-huh. Guess who’s next.

1218
01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.965
No. no. no. Wait.
wait. Remember. we set you free.

1219
01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.883
Well. yeah I didn’t
think your exposure therapy.

1220
01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:55.301
would be quite
so fucking extreme.

1221
01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:57.637
Yeah. but look.
it-- it was able to show you

1222
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.180
how extraordinary you are.

1223
01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:01.516
You served me up
like a lamb to the slaughter.

1224
01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:03.309
I had no idea!

1225
01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:05.061
But look at you. Lindy.

1226
01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.689
You’re so special.

1227
01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:09.232
I’m a freak. Are
you gonna shoot me?

1228
01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.441
What?

1229
01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:11.609
No. I don’t
think so. I don’t know...

1230
01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:13.569
-What have you got that for?
-Sorry.

1231
01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:16.030
You’re not
a freak. You’re magnificent.

1232
01:16:16.114 --> 01:16:18.449
Now. we can
really start to work.

1233
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.701
Now.

1234
01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:21.411
Think about the things
that we can do together--

1235
01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:24.664
Are you out of
your mind? You betrayed me!

1236
01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:26.541
I helped you more than
anybody else in the world.

1237
01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:27.625
Fuck you!

1238
01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:40.263
-Stop fucking moving.
-Lindy. drop the gun!

1239
01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:41.848
-Hold on!
-You’re hurting me!

1240
01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.725
-Drop the gun! Okay.
-I’m not done!

1241
01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.229
-Ah. fuck! You shot me!
-Fuck.

1242
01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:49.939
Sorry. I thought
you were trying to kill him.

1243
01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.983
No. you twat! I was
doing your job for you.

1244
01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.234
-again.
-Don’t call me twat!

1245
01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:55.028
Ivan Marcellus Munchin.
you are under arrest

1246
01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.321
for practicing medicine
without a license.

1247
01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:57.488
-Ow!
-All right.

1248
01:16:57.572 --> 01:16:58.781
I’m gonna keep pressure on it.

1249
01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.825
Take your finger
off my leg hole.

1250
01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:02.869
Little help?

1251
01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.371
And the security guards?

1252
01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:08.916
Uh. self-defense.

1253
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.794
And the incident
with the jumper cables?

1254
01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:14.339
Also self-defense.

1255
01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:15.923
Self-defense.

1256
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:18.384
And the maternity ward?

1257
01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:19.886
Mistaken identity.

1258
01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.724
What happened
to "living by the rules"?

1259
01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.976
Some rules are
better than others.

1260
01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.604
What. does this
mean I’m not going to jail?

1261
01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.147
You’re going to jail.

1262
01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:32.231
You attacked me.

1263
01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.650
You drove around
the city like a lunatic.

1264
01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:37.111
in a car that costs
more than my yearly pay.

1265
01:17:37.195 --> 01:17:38.529
You’re going to jail. sweetie.

1266
01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:40.323
I see you out front.

1267
01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:43.576
-And I’ll see you in court.
-Look forward to it. Detective.

1268
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.661
This is every day for me.

1269
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:53.836
They took it off
you in the ambulance.

1270
01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.673
So. what’s next?

1271
01:17:57.757 --> 01:18:00.718
Um. I don’t know.
I start over I guess.

1272
01:18:00.802 --> 01:18:03.554
Just... no more blind dates.

1273
01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:06.349
Hmm. that’s
probably a good idea.

1274
01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.809
Lots of creeps out there.

1275
01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:10.186
I mean. there are...

1276
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.688
some nice guys too.

1277
01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:15.233
Yeah.

1278
01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:22.365
Here you go.

1279
01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.951
Thank you.

1280
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.411
I’m not gonna find
a bunch of pictures.

1281
01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:27.662
of your bumhole on this. am I?

1282
01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:29.747
Of my bumhole? No.

1283
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.918
What kind of
sleazeball do you think I am?

1284
01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:36.212
I mean. the kind
that shoots a woman in the leg.

1285
01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:39.340
Yeah.
Well. sorry about that.

1286
01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:42.552
Well. you know. I could
always make it up to you.

1287
01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:43.719
Dinner sometime?

1288
01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:47.765
Um. I’ll--
I’ll think about it.

1289
01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:50.643
I’m an excellent cook.

1290
01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:53.396
Double down on the halibut.

1291
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.731
All right. piss off now.

1292
01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.534
Spare any change. please?

1293
01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:08.578
But...

1294
01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.745
Do you want that?

1295
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.081
Okay.

1296
01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:43.297
You’re back.

1297
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.509
Can I help you?

1298
01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.594
I was just
checking it out. you know?

1299
01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.429
It looks so
beat up from outside.

1300
01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:51.806
Who are you?

1301
01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:55.184
It’s like
a bomb went off in here.

1302
01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:57.103
Yeah. I had a tricky boiler.

1303
01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:00.731
But why have you come back?

1304
01:21:02.108 --> 01:21:03.401
It’s my apartment.

1305
01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.736
Well. most people.
when their lives blow up.

1306
01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.029
would just keep on running.

1307
01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.783
It is so nice
that you wanted to come home

1308
01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.285
to try all over again.

1309
01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.078
Sorry. do I know you?

1310
01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.372
-Have you been following me?
-Yeah.

1311
01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:17.790
What do you actually want?

1312
01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.503
You are just as
spunky as Munchin described.

1313
01:21:22.587 --> 01:21:24.672
You’ve done well under our care.

1314
01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:26.549
Okay. I’ve done
enough messing around.

1315
01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:29.844
with psychotic therapists
and the fucking CIA.

1316
01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.679
or whatever you are.

1317
01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:34.557
I totally understand.

1318
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.060
You’ve spent years being
forced to repress your anger.

1319
01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:39.645
I’m sorry about Justin.

1320
01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:41.731
What he did was unsanctioned.

1321
01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.983
But now...

1322
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.402
Now Lindy.

1323
01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.738
you have seen
how powerful you can be

1324
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.448
when you embrace your rage.

1325
01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.491
I’m okay as I am. Thanks.

1326
01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.576
Really?

1327
01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.370
Well. how are you?

1328
01:21:56.454 --> 01:21:58.497
You’re not normal.

1329
01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:00.207
You really think you’d be happy.

1330
01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:02.084
living without a purpose?

1331
01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.711
Through our work. you’ll learn

1332
01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:06.589
to harness your rage
and target the right people.

1333
01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:11.093
Humans. are the most
powerful. undetectable weapon.

1334
01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:56.926
Holy shit!
