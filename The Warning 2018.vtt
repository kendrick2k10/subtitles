00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:10.164
- Hello. Andrea.
- Hello. Jon.

4
00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.580
Are you with David?
He's not picking up.

5
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.625
No. I'm waiting outside.
I think he was in a meeting.

6
00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.007
What a nerve.

7
00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.341
If he's not out in 5 minutes.
drag him out by the hair.

8
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.641
Okay.

9
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.425
And can you get some ice
from the 24-hour store. please?

10
00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.528
Your buddy can't do without
his gin and tonic.

11
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:27.973
Whatever you say. boss.

12
00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:31.106
Go on. don't be long. Big kiss.

13
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.607
See you soon. Big kiss.

14
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.571
- That's it. Jon. Let's go.
- 32 minutes late.

15
00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.580
Sorry. I'll tell you later. Go.

16
00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.676
I have to get some ice
from the 24-hour store.

17
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.122
And champagne.

18
00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.146
No shit. You're going to ask her?

19
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.567
- Tonight?
- Sure. with you there.

20
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.489
Fuck no. I'll tell her we're spending
the weekend in Paris.

21
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.069
That's great. Paris.

22
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.405
Yes. I'll propose to her in Paris.

23
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.539
She'll love it. I'm happy for you.
Well. for both of you.

24
00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:29.834
I know.

25
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.041
You know who's going to be
my best man. right?

26
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.173
- If he says yes...
- Shit. man. Can you imagine?

27
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.960
Kneeling under the Eiffel Tower
like: "Will you marry me?".

28
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:46.260
and she says:
"No. no! Fuck off".

29
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.720
Fuck that!

30
00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.296
I'll go.

31
00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.834
- Want anything?
- The ice. don't forget it. Thanks.

32
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.527
Fuck...

33
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.203
David!

34
00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:31.956
David...

35
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:34.875
David.

36
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.206
David!

37
00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.090
Call an ambulance!

38
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.965
Call an ambulance!

39
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.618
A guy was killed in there
ten years ago.

40
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.622
There was blood
and bits of brain on the floor.

41
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.414
I heard there was a shootout.
that two guys died.

42
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.421
Look. he's gonna piss himself.

43
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.430
Now go inside the store
and get us a porn mag.

44
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.811
Go on. move it!

45
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:53.962
- Move it!
- Go!

46
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.862
Nico. what are you doing here?

47
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.026
I waited for you at school
for half an hour!

48
00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.588
Are you alright?

49
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.543
Sorry. mom.

50
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.127
Go on. get in.

51
00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.341
Where's your bag?

52
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.680
At school.
I don't have any homework.

53
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.764
This is the last time
you leave without telling me.

54
00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.103
Put on your seat belt.

55
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.898
How is he?

56
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.442
In a coma.

57
00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.410
They're going to do
some brain activity tests on him

58
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.239
and give us the results
in the morning.

59
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.665
My brother's not going
without a fight.

60
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.582
- Can I see him?
- Give me a second.

61
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.047
Did you see who did it?

62
00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.756
I saw someone go.
but not his face. It was so fast.

63
00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.636
He ran off?

64
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.217
No. he got in a car.

65
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.680
Anything else that could help?
Another man inside.

66
00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.805
He was. I don't know.
from the east or Russian.

67
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.273
He had a tattoo here
and he was hurt.

68
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.438
He pointed a gun at me and left.

69
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.563
We're going to get
the fucker who did this.

70
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.700
Let's go.

71
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.631
Honey...

72
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.676
You have to fight. Please.

73
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.851
Don't let me alone. Please.

74
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.142
Please. please hold on.

75
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.442
He can't die.

76
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.213
He's not going to die.

77
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.485
You owe us a mag. asshole!

78
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.531
Don't forget. dickhead!

79
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:50.834
Go. go!

80
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:54.713
Mom...

81
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:57.668
Mom. let's go.

82
00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.551
- You have to learn to defend yourself.
- They're older than me.

83
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.388
If they insult or hit you.
tell the teacher. or I will.

84
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:12.724
I'm not a snitch. mom.
And please don't talk to the school.

85
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.399
Unless you defend yourself.
they'll keep after you.

86
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.355
And they're going
to return your backpack.

87
00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.832
I have to get gas.
Go get a shake for you.

88
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:25.887
What are you doing?

89
00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.972
Aren't you a bit young
to be stealing porn?

90
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.115
How old are you?

91
00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.826
I'll be ten next week.

92
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.187
Please don't tell my mother.

93
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:21.853
Don't worry.

94
00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.977
Thanks.

95
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.145
Did you get the shake?

96
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.859
Not yet.

97
00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:29.444
What are you waiting for?

98
00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:33.778
How much is it? Pump 7.

99
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:37.324
That's 30 for the gas
and the magazine.

100
00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.492
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

101
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.884
Do you come to this store a lot?

102
00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.183
No.

103
00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:56.430
It looked like the owner knew you.
What were you talking about?

104
00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.638
Did you know a guy
got killed in there ten years ago?

105
00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:02.731
They blew his brains out.

106
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.934
Who told you that?

107
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.696
Kids at school. Is it true?

108
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.820
The same ones that are picking on you?

109
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:17.280
I'm sure they made it up
to scare you.

110
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.836
It's a positive response.

111
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.257
We're optimistic.
but we have to wait.

112
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.425
- It's too soon to tell.
- Excuse me.

113
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.067
The doctor said that a vein
is blocking the temporal lobe

114
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.824
and that may be why
his brain's not reacting.

115
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.200
Then they can save him?

116
00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:58.078
Yes. They said the operation
is complicated. but yes.

117
00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:01.457
there's a chance he could
come out of the coma.

118
00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:04.494
That's great news.
When are they operating on him?

119
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.879
I don't know. he's still very weak.

120
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.838
They've given him blood transfusions
and they have to watch his progress.

121
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:12.971
Excuse me a second.

122
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:15.682
Marta.

123
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.970
Listen... did you get my message?

124
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:21.813
Yes.

125
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.062
Shootout in 24-hour store

126
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.267
no. he's still very weak.

127
00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.981
Don't tell mom and dad yet. okay?

128
00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:38.945
I'll keep you posted. Big kiss.

129
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.208
Terrorist attack by eta
in same place 32 years ago

130
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.087
Jon.

131
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.299
Jon.

132
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.008
32 years ago there
was an attack in the same place.

133
00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.003
In the 24-hour place?

134
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.102
Go home and rest.
you must be exhausted.

135
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.058
No. I'm fine.

136
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.895
Shall we get some dinner or...?

137
00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:11.148
No. I want to spend some time
with David's mother.

138
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.487
Relax. If anything happens
I'll tell you. okay?

139
00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.273
- Okay.
- Alright.

140
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.868
Thanks. Ciao.

141
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.653
- Ciao.
- Ciao. ciao.

142
00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.588
Saving alife lisandro Lopez. 10

143
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:44.306
gas station

144
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:48.189
a 32-year-old man
with two gunshot wounds...

145
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.125
Nico. snack time.

146
00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.963
Eat up. then finish
your homework. okay?

147
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:33.976
Nico. your snack.

148
00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:50.660
What's wrong. Nico?

149
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.955
Are you alright?

150
00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.257
Bastards.

151
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:06.686
Relax.

152
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:11.347
It's alright.
It's just a sick joke.

153
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.145
Get up. you've had an accident.

154
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:25.455
I'm sorry. mom.

155
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:31.200
- I didn't realize.
- Never mind. it's fine.

156
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.914
Go to the bathroom.

157
00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:42.135
Whatever happens.
don't go to the 24-hour place

158
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:43.784
on your birthday.
If you do. you'll die.

159
00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.265
It was in his bag.
inside that envelope.

160
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.321
They're making his life impossible.
They pick on him. take his things.

161
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.641
hit him. and no one does anything.

162
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.806
I saw it myself the other day.
And now this.

163
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.853
Lucia. we do all we can
to avoid these situations.

164
00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.835
I'll find out who these boys are
and give them a serious talking to.

165
00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:04.526
It's not about talking.
I won't let them do this to my son.

166
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.740
I want them punished. expelled.

167
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.655
I understand.
but this is a state school.

168
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.450
We can't do anything
without being totally sure.

169
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.038
First I'd have to talk to Nico.

170
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:18.581
He won't tell you anything.

171
00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.170
He keeps it to himself
and he's having a rough time.

172
00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:25.262
They're scaring him with the story
of the man killed in the gas station.

173
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.800
And now this letter?
They're persecuting him.

174
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.302
Those are harsh words.

175
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:34.055
Harsh words?

176
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.772
"Whatever happens. don't go
to the 24-hour store

177
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.656
on your birthday. April 12. 2018.

178
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.235
If you do. you'll die."

179
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.873
Yesterday. when Nico read
that letter. he wet himself.

180
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.454
That's never happened to him.

181
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.884
Let's do this...
Leave me the note.

182
00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.214
If they bother Nico again.
he has must tell

183
00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.724
the teacher or the head teacher.
or me. immediately.

184
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.681
Otherwise we can't help him. Lucia.

185
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.172
Take a good look.

186
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:47.388
There.

187
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.642
The bullet came from
that fucker's gun.

188
00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:57.793
- Did you find out anything else?
- No.

189
00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:01.150
But we'll catch him.
It's a matter of time.

190
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.770
How are the others?
The store guy and the boy.

191
00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:08.191
The owner's alright.
He got a good scare. but...

192
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:12.449
I'm worried about the boy.
he's only 10.

193
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:15.625
107?

194
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.210
Yes. Why?

195
00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:24.381
Did you know that in '76
there was an attack right there?

196
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.878
And there was a boy
at the shootout too. 10 years old.

197
00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:33.348
That's strange.

198
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.518
Pure chance.

199
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:44.981
Fucking bugs.

200
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:25.734
What's wrong?

201
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.272
My mom went to talk
to the principal yesterday

202
00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.032
and I'm bound to get it
from Luis and his friends.

203
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:37.498
Look.

204
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:43.373
Let's go.

205
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:45.750
Whose idea was it?

206
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.631
We didn't do anything.

207
00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.417
Sure. the note wrote itself

208
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.836
and magically got into Nico's bag.

209
00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:53.139
Maybe.

210
00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:56.849
Fine. We'll do a handwriting test.

211
00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:00.261
And if the writing on this note
matches any of you.

212
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:01.849
I'll open a harassment protocol.

213
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.063
And if I find out you've laid
a hand on Nico.

214
00:24:06.362 --> 00:24:08.944
I'll expel all three of you.
Is that clear?

215
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.443
What does the note say?

216
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:16.777
That if I go to the 24-hour store
on my birthday. I'll die.

217
00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:30.294
Jon?

218
00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:31.594
Jon zarate.

219
00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:33.298
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

220
00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:34.086
Come in.

221
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.390
Yes.

222
00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:37.259
I made some photocopies.

223
00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:38.559
Thank you.

224
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.268
See? In 1976 there was no store.

225
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:44.976
just the pumps and an office.

226
00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:48.312
The official car was here. filling up.

227
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:50.648
The general was in back.
reading the paper.

228
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:54.740
I was with the general's escort
cleaning the windshield.

229
00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:56.616
A beautiful black dodge.

230
00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:03.081
Then I heard the sound
of a motorbike approaching.

231
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:05.371
With two men.

232
00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:11.966
Suddenly. the passenger
pulled out a machine gun.

233
00:25:14.722 --> 00:25:15.837
It all happened so fast.

234
00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:22.055
The escort jumped on me
and covered me with his body.

235
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.352
Meanwhile. the terrorist
shot at the car.

236
00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.069
When the magazine was empty.

237
00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:38.993
he yelled "long live eta".
got on the bike and they left.

238
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:41.408
I tried to move. but I couldn't.

239
00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:44.205
The escort's body was on top of me.

240
00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.954
He was dead.

241
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.959
The general was shot several times.
but he was luckier

242
00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:56.377
and survived.

243
00:25:57.765 --> 00:25:58.925
I went to the funeral.

244
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:01.507
I'll never forget it.

245
00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:05.594
The escort's mother came over...

246
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:10.436
And made me promise
to make the most of my life

247
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:13.478
so that her son's death
was not in vain.

248
00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:17.735
I'm not a genius or a scientist
or anything. but...

249
00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:20.151
What I make from this business
allows me

250
00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:22.536
to finance some soup kitchens

251
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:25.618
and some summer camps
for underprivileged kids.

252
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:27.499
I think I kept my promise.

253
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.583
Why do you want to know all this?

254
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:35.632
The person shot in the shootout
is my best friend.

255
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:38.506
I'm sorry.

256
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:41.797
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

257
00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:45.061
What?

258
00:26:45.187 --> 00:26:48.054
That there were two shootouts
in the same place.

259
00:26:48.357 --> 00:26:50.222
In both. five people were present.

260
00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:52.062
In both. a 10-year-old boy.

261
00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:55.398
Yes. I do think it's strange.

262
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:02.158
Because in 1955

263
00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.819
there was another murder there.

264
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.873
And it happened on April 12.

265
00:27:45.372 --> 00:27:48.284
See you in the locker room
in the gym. it's important

266
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.389
Sara?

267
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.979
You thought you'd scored. huh?

268
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.732
You made up that shit
to fuck us over.

269
00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:18.485
- I didn't make up anything.
- You wrote it yourself!

270
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.647
- I didn't do anything!
- We could get expelled!

271
00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:25.029
Strip.

272
00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.615
Take off your clothes
or I'll beat your fucking head in!

273
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:30.906
Strip!

274
00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.113
Smile.

275
00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:11.704
Listen to me.

276
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.418
Fuck us over again
and I'll put this photo on the net.

277
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:18.746
Got it?

278
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.605
- Nobody told you?
- No.

279
00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.990
- Nobody told you?
- No. What happened?

280
00:29:47.286 --> 00:29:48.617
Okay. here's what happened...

281
00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:50.118
Seriously?

282
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:55.373
Fernando. when was this?

283
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:57.751
- I don't believe it.
- Want to see the photo?

284
00:30:00.257 --> 00:30:01.417
Nico. what's wrong?

285
00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:06.840
I've got a photo. guys...

286
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:21.459
Jon zarate. winner of
the math Olympics

287
00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:25.543
hello. this is Jon zarate.
Leave a message. Thanks.

288
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:29.092
Mr. zarate. this is social services.

289
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:33.305
The renewal of your temporary leave
is up for revision.

290
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.716
We need to do a complete check-up

291
00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:38.135
to reauthorize it.

292
00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:47.628
Hello?

293
00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:49.539
Yes. I'm coming down.

294
00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:39.927
- What is it?
- Nothing.

295
00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:42.934
How old was the Russian
at the 24-hour store?

296
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.686
40. 42.

297
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:46.982
40 or 427

298
00:33:49.444 --> 00:33:50.444
I don't know. 42.

299
00:33:52.072 --> 00:33:54.028
42

300
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.160
How long have they been now?

301
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:13.207
David was taking me
to Paris this weekend.

302
00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:17.928
He left the computer on
and I saw the tickets.

303
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:21.264
He's not much good at keeping secrets.

304
00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.058
Right.

305
00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:29.309
He told you everything. huh?

306
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:33.298
Right after I got out of the hospital.

307
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.895
Jon.

308
00:34:35.198 --> 00:34:37.860
those were six tough months.

309
00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:39.736
These things happen.

310
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:44.245
I was in for a long time. you two
spent a lot of time together...

311
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:55.753
- They've finished.
- And?

312
00:34:57.012 --> 00:34:59.298
The surgeon says it went well.

313
00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:01.463
We have to see how he progresses.

314
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.386
- Let's grab something to eat.
- Yes.

315
00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:15.272
We've caught the man who did it.

316
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:22.150
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes. of course.

317
00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:25.070
Sure. but if he's a minor
and gets away with it...

318
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:29.241
He's not a minor. For sure.
He's around 20.

319
00:35:31.004 --> 00:35:33.245
21. he's 21.

320
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:41.677
What I'm going to tell you
may sound strange. but listen. okay?

321
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:46.599
I've been looking into some things...

322
00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:49.974
The night David was shot
at the 24-hour place.

323
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:54.016
there were 5 people:
The owner. 53. a 10-year-old boy.

324
00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:56.776
David. who's 32. the Russian. 42.

325
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:59.154
and since we don't know
the assailant's age.

326
00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:01.314
we'll put a question Mark. okay?

327
00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:05.614
Right. on April 12. 1976.
this same place was attacked.

328
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:07.404
There were also 5 people present:

329
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:10.198
A general aged 53.
his escort. 21.

330
00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:12.288
a 10-year-old boy. a terrorist. 42.

331
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.587
and the other terrorist was 32 exactly.
Do you see the sequence?

332
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:22.628
- That's insane.
- If you think that is. check this out.

333
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:28.467
In 1955. in the same place.
there was another shooting.

334
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.182
- Also on April 12.
- At the gas station?

335
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:34.188
But in '55 it was an inn.
It was a crime of passion.

336
00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:36.566
The owner had a lover

337
00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.981
and when she wanted to break up
with him he went crazy

338
00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:40.632
and turned up at the inn
with a shotgun.

339
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.031
The man was exactly 53.

340
00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:46.284
the woman. 42. a nephew
who worked at the inn. 21.

341
00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:48.661
A customer having a glass
of wine there. 32.

342
00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.072
Who else was there?

343
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:52.741
The woman's son. who was 10.

344
00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:56.207
That's why I say that David's killer
has to be exactly 21.

345
00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:59.130
because the numerical sequence
is perfect. Isn't it amazing?

346
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:02.293
Jon. people don't die
because of a math.

347
00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.051
This makes no sense.

348
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:07.259
Yes. it does. Here the proof.
numbers don't lie.

349
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:10.301
It's happened three times
and someone dies every time. It's math!

350
00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:12.139
David's not dead. damn it!

351
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:20.526
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

352
00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:24.985
It's true.

353
00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:28.117
It's my stupid idea.

354
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:33.619
Jon. David was shot
on April 2. not 12.

355
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:36.076
That's true.

356
00:37:36.379 --> 00:37:39.542
- Where'd you get that date from?
- You mean I'm making it up?

357
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:41.752
I don't mean anything.
You tell me.

358
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:44.258
April 12 is your birthday.

359
00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:45.554
And?

360
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.493
- Have you stopped taking your meds?
- I can't take them.

361
00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:51.357
They make my head fuzzy
and I need to be lucid.

362
00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:54.010
But you can't stop taking the pills.

363
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:57.935
Does your doctor know about this?

364
00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:02.485
I'm going to the bathroom

365
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:43.537
21.50. please.

366
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.751
I don't give a fuck about your family.

367
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.213
- You're not going to any birthday!
- You know I really want to.

368
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.468
- You're staying at home.
- What's wrong with it?

369
00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.176
You're going home
to look after your fucking kids!

370
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:56.340
Please. not here.

371
00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:59.636
You're not going anywhere.
Much less with your slutty cousin.

372
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.554
- She's a pig.
- Don't say that.

373
00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:03.564
Sir. you have to leave the store.

374
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.600
Don't fucking touch me!

375
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.001
- Sit down.
- No. thanks.

376
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:32.885
We've spoken to the three boys

377
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:35.342
we think might've written the note.

378
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.307
And nothing. they deny it all.

379
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.222
What else would they say?

380
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:42.762
We did a handwriting test on them

381
00:40:43.066 --> 00:40:46.479
and the writing on the note
doesn't match any of them.

382
00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:49.235
Look. see for yourself.

383
00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:57.493
Handwriting expert report

384
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.037
but someone had to write it.

385
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:03.245
According to the test.
it's an adult's handwriting.

386
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:08.295
Lucia. I don't want to pry.

387
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:10.877
but I think
it's my duty to tell you...

388
00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:13.964
Maybe this matter is related
to your family situation.

389
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:16.463
I don't understand.

390
00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:19.925
We know that your ex-husband
has a restraining order.

391
00:41:20.228 --> 00:41:22.310
We've dealt with
this kind of thing before.

392
00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:24.596
and maybe Nico's father is involved.

393
00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:27.394
This is the limit.

394
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:32.399
Lucia. listen. please.
The note mentions his birthday.

395
00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:34.906
Maybe the father wants
to be with the boy.

396
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:37.317
I'm reporting this to the police.

397
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.485
Lucia. please.

398
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.532
I'm sorry if I offended you.
but we can't rule out the possibility.

399
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:47.669
All you care about is your record
and this fucking school.

400
00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:50.409
- I care about my students.
- Then keep them away from him.

401
00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:52.919
fucking do that!

402
00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:56.920
They won't touch your boy again.
I assure you.

403
00:41:59.142 --> 00:42:02.054
You said that last time
and nothing's changed.

404
00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:56.362
Here you are. And your change.

405
00:42:57.325 --> 00:42:59.532
- Thanks.
- 'Bye.

406
00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:11.995
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

407
00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:17.712
I was here the other day with my son.
We bought a magazine.

408
00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:20.469
Someone slipped an envelope inside
with a threat.

409
00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:23.472
that if he came here
on April 12. he'd die.

410
00:43:23.768 --> 00:43:25.474
Maybe it's not a threat.

411
00:43:27.814 --> 00:43:29.600
Maybe it's a warning.

412
00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:32.477
This is ridiculous.
Did you do it?

413
00:43:34.028 --> 00:43:37.236
Look. there was a shootout here
years ago on April 12.

414
00:43:37.532 --> 00:43:39.648
Don't let your son
come here on that day.

415
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:41.778
end of story.

416
00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.513
Employee. 32

417
00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:10.849
killer. 53

418
00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:14.186
hello. this is Jon zarate.
Leave a message.

419
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:15.770
Thank you.

420
00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:17.689
Mr. zarate.

421
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:21.277
Dr. Ortiz insists that
you contact us immediately.

422
00:44:21.576 --> 00:44:25.489
The therapy is vital for controlling
the progress of the medication.

423
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.073
Please. call us.

424
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:32.829
Bloody incident at head office
of credito agricola bank

425
00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:56.065
Don't blink. please.

426
00:44:58.529 --> 00:44:59.644
The left one.

427
00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:04.361
Good.

428
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:08.569
Are you feeling alright?

429
00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.909
Yes. I haven't slept much lately.

430
00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:15.118
You have eyestrain.
I'll prescribe some drops.

431
00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.755
Actually.
I didn't come here about my eyes.

432
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:22.132
Why then?

433
00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:27.468
I wanted to know if you were
the son of Mercedes vizcay.

434
00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:30.094
the woman who died
at the los molinos inn.

435
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.941
I'm sorry.
but I have patients waiting.

436
00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:44.902
You were 10 when it happened.
weren't you?

437
00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:48.200
Are you a journalist?

438
00:45:48.496 --> 00:45:50.111
No. I'm not a journalist.

439
00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.951
In that same spot a few days ago
a friend of mine was shot.

440
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:56.743
I read about in the papers.
I'm really sorry.

441
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:58.081
Thanks a lot.

442
00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:01.957
Also in this place there was
an attack in '76.

443
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.541
And another murder in 1913.
I don't know if you knew that.

444
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:09.509
What do you want from me?

445
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.966
Whatever. any information.

446
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.932
I couldn't find out much
about what happened in 1913.

447
00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:20.103
That place is cursed.

448
00:46:22.238 --> 00:46:23.523
It was a massacre.

449
00:46:24.699 --> 00:46:25.905
Do you know what happened?

450
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:29.817
Listen to me. leave it alone.

451
00:46:31.372 --> 00:46:32.703
Forget that place.

452
00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:35.581
I need to know.
Please. I need this.

453
00:46:56.897 --> 00:46:58.478
Ask for Veronica.

454
00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:01.353
maybe she can give you more details.

455
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:07.406
Hello. this is Veronica.
I can't pick up right now.

456
00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.444
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

457
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:14.949
Hello. this is Veronica.
I can't pick up...

458
00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.074
Are you stupid or what?!

459
00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:49.047
Can I help you?

460
00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:53.256
Excuse me
are you looking for something?

461
00:49:03.232 --> 00:49:04.563
I know you.

462
00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:09.852
You were here on the day
of the shooting.

463
00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.903
What do you know about
this place before it was yours?

464
00:49:15.828 --> 00:49:17.948
Nothing. it was a gas station.
I bought it from a guy.

465
00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:19.205
That's a lie.

466
00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:24.954
Look. if you're not buying anything.
you'd better go.

467
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.967
I don't want any trouble.
Go or I'll call the police.

468
00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:07.034
All these species

469
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.167
develop different behavior...

470
00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:14.216
Leave me alone.

471
00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:15.922
What's wrong?

472
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:17.678
You know very well.

473
00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:21.431
I had nothing to do with it.
How can you even think that?

474
00:50:23.312 --> 00:50:25.769
You're not the only one
who got the warning.

475
00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:39.775
Martin vallet did too.

476
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:41.496
How do you know?

477
00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.866
Her mother told mine.

478
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:47.036
He got a note?

479
00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:49.452
No. the day Martin was born

480
00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.622
a man appeared at the hospital
and warned them.

481
00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.291
What did he say to them?

482
00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:58.836
If he went to the 24-hour place
when he turned 10.

483
00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:00.219
he'd die.

484
00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:04.517
That's why they won't let him
leave the house that day.

485
00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:43.715
- Nothing's going to happen.
- How do you know?

486
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:46.634
- It'll be a wonderful day.
- You can't be sure of that.

487
00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:50.100
Honey. it's your birthday.
We'll see a movie and get a burger.

488
00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:53.836
I don't want to go
to the 24-hour place.

489
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:58.483
Nico. we'll go there together
and I'll buy you a present. okay?

490
00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:01.740
Are you crazy? I'm not going there.
much less on my birthday.

491
00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:04.652
You can't live in fear.
Fear stops you from living.

492
00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.662
- I don't care. I'm not going there!
- Yes. you are.

493
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:11.041
- You can't make me.
- I'm not. I'm going with you!

494
00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:12.747
My dad wouldn't do this.

495
00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:18.290
- Any good father would do it.
- That's a lie.

496
00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:23.095
Another boy got the warning.

497
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.597
And his parents didn't let him
leave the house that day.

498
00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:58.543
Our lady of Pilar
care home for the elderly

499
00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.480
Jon. David's getting worse.

500
00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.020
The doctors fear the worst.

501
00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:23.314
He's not responding
to his treatment. and...

502
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:25.027
Call me. please.

503
00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:31.113
She's deaf in her right ear.

504
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.705
Sometimes she confuses
places and people.

505
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:37.665
Otherwise. she's fine.

506
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:40.171
There she is.

507
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.551
Good afternoon.
Thank you for seeing me.

508
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:01.063
Do we know each other?

509
00:54:01.363 --> 00:54:04.400
No. I'm here on behalf of
your granddaughter Veronica.

510
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.742
She spoke very highly of you.
she said you're incredible...

511
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.079
And have an excellent memory.

512
00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:16.242
She's a historian.
she loves old things like me.

513
00:54:16.545 --> 00:54:19.207
But why did she send you

514
00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:21.872
to this whistle stop for mummies?

515
00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:25.384
She told me you could
tell me what happened

516
00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:28.261
at that branch of
crédito agricola bank.

517
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:32.178
That was a long time ago.

518
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:36.057
I was barely 2 years old.

519
00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:41.225
But you heard about what your father.
Ezequiel Gonzalez. did?

520
00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:49.571
What happened?
What was your father like?

521
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:54.037
My father was a desperate man.

522
00:54:56.335 --> 00:54:59.042
He'd spent a long time
in the African war.

523
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.838
He got all kinds of diseases there.

524
00:55:05.344 --> 00:55:07.050
When he came back.

525
00:55:07.346 --> 00:55:10.884
he infected me with one of
those African viruses.

526
00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:13.803
I was dying

527
00:55:14.102 --> 00:55:16.684
and my father had no money
for the treatment.

528
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.720
so he went to that bank

529
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:21.561
and begged the manager

530
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.316
to give him a loan.

531
00:55:25.697 --> 00:55:29.861
But since we were poor
and had no property.

532
00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.575
the manager refused.

533
00:55:33.872 --> 00:55:37.364
My father was so desperate
watching his daughter die...

534
00:55:38.627 --> 00:55:41.243
That he decided to Rob that bank.

535
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:44.170
But something went wrong.

536
00:55:46.802 --> 00:55:48.463
It all went wrong.

537
00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:56.558
The bank manager had a gun

538
00:55:56.854 --> 00:55:58.560
and tried to stop the robbery.

539
00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:04.983
The other people started screaming...

540
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:10.239
And he acted like he was in the war.

541
00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:13.492
He went crazy and started shooting.

542
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:21.704
He killed four people.

543
00:56:26.008 --> 00:56:27.873
Then he committed suicide.

544
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.720
He committed suicide?

545
00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:40.810
Who could live with the death of
four innocent people

546
00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:43.688
on their conscience?

547
00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:50.403
I won't bother you anymore.

548
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.410
Thank you for everything.

549
00:56:57.623 --> 00:57:01.241
Are you sure...
We don't know each other?

550
00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:07.997
No.

551
00:57:09.968 --> 00:57:10.968
Thank you.

552
00:57:27.319 --> 00:57:29.651
April 12. 1913.

553
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.437
Girl

554
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:35.195
April 12. '55.

555
00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:39.240
April 12. '76.

556
00:57:40.374 --> 00:57:42.865
Always April 12.

557
00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:49.298
No. not always.

558
00:57:51.718 --> 00:57:54.084
Not always.

559
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.768
But he's still alive.

560
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:36.072
He's alive physically.

561
00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:39.739
but the latest tests indicate
that he's in phase 4.

562
00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:41.035
it's advanced.

563
00:59:42.037 --> 00:59:43.777
There's no hope of recovery.

564
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:46.697
I'm very sorry.

565
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.536
Is there nothing
that can be done?

566
00:59:50.212 --> 00:59:51.418
Unfortunately. no.

567
00:59:51.713 --> 00:59:54.671
I think the most humane thing
would be to turn off life support

568
00:59:54.966 --> 00:59:57.582
- and let him go in peace.
- But...

569
00:59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.423
Some people have woken up.
There have been cases.

570
01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.258
The probability is one in a million.

571
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.718
That means there's hope.

572
01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:10.064
Let's go.

573
01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.272
It's over.

574
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:16.769
No. we can't let him die. Please.

575
01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:36.459
Hello. this is Jon zarate.
Leave a message.

576
01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:37.758
Thank you.

577
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.630
Jon. they want to disconnect him.

578
01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:43.671
I need you to help me.
Come here or...

579
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.259
Call me back.

580
01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.865
Boy. 10

581
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:21.924
Go!

582
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.131
Good. good. good.

583
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:25.967
Check him out.

584
01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:32.848
The ref's a bit crap.

585
01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:37.356
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

586
01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.188
- Martin vallet's father?
- Yes.

587
01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.736
I'm Lucia. the mother
of Nicolas. a classmate.

588
01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.239
Hi. Nice to meet you.
What. did they fight?

589
01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.990
No. It's not that.

590
01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:49.661
Is Martin not going to class
on Tuesday?

591
01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:51.321
Yes. Why?

592
01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:55.288
My son received a note.
a sort of warning or threat...

593
01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:58.499
- And you think it was Martin?
- No. no. But I was told that...

594
01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:01.255
You got one years ago
in the hospital.

595
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:05.260
- when your wife was giving birth.
- I don't know what you mean.

596
01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.955
Martin's not going on Tuesday
because he's seeing the doctor.

597
01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.142
Of course.

598
01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:12.471
- Soorry.
- It's okay.

599
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.057
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

600
01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:29.158
What did he say?
He not going to class. is he?

601
01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:31.410
He's not going because
he has to see the doctor.

602
01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.573
- Even he doesn't believe that.
- That's enough! Okay?!

603
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:41.417
I don't want to hear
another word about this. Got it?

604
01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:44.548
Put your belt on.

605
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.719
- I've been calling you.
- I lost my cellphone.

606
01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:25.170
Sorry. it's a disaster here.
How's David?

607
01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.926
They're disconnecting him tomorrow.
Pablo and his mother have decided.

608
01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.589
Jon. I need you to talk to them.
Tell them David is still alive.

609
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.292
They're disconnecting him tomorrow?

610
01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.260
Tomorrow at 12.

611
01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:39.979
Now it makes sense.

612
01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.724
What does?

613
01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:51.150
It's all 12. understand?

614
01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:55.116
April 12. Ezequiel killed four people.
then committed suicide.

615
01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.954
Exactly 42 years later
a woman aged 42 dies.

616
01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:05.171
21 years later
a man aged 21 dies.

617
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.168
And 32 years later
a man aged 32 will die.

618
01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:17.175
You see? The pattern
has repeated four times.

619
01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.720
Every time one dies.
the next one is born.

620
01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.856
It only needs to repeat once more
for the circle to close.

621
01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:27.811
So in 10 years.
a 10-year-old boy will die.

622
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.322
Can you hear yourself?

623
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.033
- What do you mean?
- I don't know...

624
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.820
You're saying that these
are all the same people.

625
01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.034
that every time one dies.
the next one is born.

626
01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:43.202
that this Ezequiel. or whatever.
is reincarnated again and again.

627
01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:45.211
I'm talking about
a numerical sequence.

628
01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.907
You're saying that David
and this killer are the same person!

629
01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.713
Andrea.
are you listening to me or not?

630
01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.970
David is going to die.
When he does. a boy will be born.

631
01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:56.472
And in 10 years
that boy will be shot.

632
01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:58.850
But now that you and I know it.
we can stop it.

633
01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:01.557
Okay. I know you feel guilty
about what happened.

634
01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:04.689
It had to happen. David and I
had to be there that night.

635
01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.270
You went there because
I asked you to!

636
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.731
David had to enter the store
for the circle to close.

637
01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.738
No. you had to go into
that fucking place!

638
01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.899
I asked you to get the ice!

639
01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.695
Don't you see?
You're the one who should be dying!

640
01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.958
Maybe. but I'm the one
here talking to you.

641
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.307
Happy birthday to you.

642
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.439
happy birthday to you.

643
01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:50.067
Happy birthday. dear Nico.

644
01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.900
happy birthday to you.

645
01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.405
Make a wish.

646
01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.238
Great!

647
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:04.331
Happy birthday. honey.

648
01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.137
Thanks a lot. mom.

649
01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.640
You're welcome. sweetie.

650
01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:27.018
Go on. get changed.
or you'll be late.

651
01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:53.464
Jon. they're going
to unplug him this afternoon.

652
01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:57.302
I'd like you to be here with me.

653
01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.173
Happy birthday. Kisses.

654
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.149
Approval form for
ceasing life support treatment

655
01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.683
Your mother's going to make you go?

656
01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.415
David was going to ask you
to marry him in Paris.

657
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.427
I kept it in case he recovered.

658
01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:26.727
Thank you.

659
01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.813
I do.

660
01:09:51.396 --> 01:09:53.136
I couldn't save you in this life.

661
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.180
but I will in the next.

662
01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.047
The maternity ward?

663
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.580
Behind that door.

664
01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.799
Maternity

665
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.192
Hey. you're not allowed in here!

666
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.974
Listen to me. It's very important.
otherwise your son will die.

667
01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.113
Whatever happens.

668
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.158
don't let your son go to
the 24-hour store on Fontana St.

669
01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.793
- On April 12. 2018.
- What the hell are you on about?

670
01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.749
24-hour store. April 12. 2018.

671
01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.130
- Let go of me.
- Fontana St.. 24-hour store.

672
01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.088
- Let go of Mel!
- I just want to help! Let go...

673
01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.469
- Or your son will die! Let go!
- Get out of here!

674
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:12.807
I just wanted to help! Please!

675
01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.263
I just wanted to help!

676
01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.054
Let go!

677
01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.473
You have to listen to me!

678
01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.316
How are you. honey?

679
01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:34.487
I'm going to the car.

680
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.445
He's not in school.

681
01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:18.823
We've looked everywhere.

682
01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:21.162
He couldn't have gone
without being seen.

683
01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.953
Could he have gone home alone?

684
01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:26.543
No. it's his birthday.

685
01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:29.175
He knew I was picking him up.
I told him to wait.

686
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.506
Take it easy.
we'll find him. okay?

687
01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:33.671
We'll search the school again.
call his friends

688
01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:36.136
and do whatever it takes
to find him.

689
01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:38.175
- Thank you.
- Excuse me for a second.

690
01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:41.429
Hello. good afternoon.

691
01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:44.307
A boy has disappeared.

692
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.491
Tell me. what's wrong with you?

693
01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.959
Unless you tell me.
I can't help you.

694
01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:14.011
Have you taken any drug or medication?

695
01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.142
I need my pills.

696
01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.148
Good. what pills do you take?

697
01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:27.684
In my pocket.

698
01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:36.151
I just wanted to warn them.
their child is in danger.

699
01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:37.864
These are pills for schizophrenia.

700
01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:41.534
You have to believe me.
April 12. 2018.

701
01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.541
- It's going to happen again.
- I'm going to give you an injection.

702
01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.038
Excuse me. are you all right?

703
01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:24.744
Yeah. Yeah.

704
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.306
Poor woman's scared to death.

705
01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.016
I'm sure Nico's fine.

706
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.356
Let's go. you'll be late for music.

707
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.360
What were you thinking. Sara?

708
01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:02.237
Do you know the fright you gave me?
And the embarrassment?

709
01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.746
I'm sorry.

710
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.908
It's my fault. it was my idea.

711
01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:09.330
I'm so sorry.

712
01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:13.793
Let's go.

713
01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:31.693
He's still alive?

714
01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.362
Yes.

715
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:36.646
He doesn't want to go.

716
01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:20.610
Mom. please...

717
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.876
Javi. I have to go pee.

718
01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:41.385
Okay. hurry up.

719
01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:57.503
- Get out of the car.
- I'm not going in.

720
01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.567
Nico. get out right now!
I'm sick of this crap!

721
01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:04.358
Listen. I was once like you.

722
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:07.074
I thought if I hid my head and
looked away. it'd all go away.

723
01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.955
But it never goes away.

724
01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:11.582
It got worse and worse.

725
01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:14.914
The fear never left me.
not even when I was alone.

726
01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:18.001
Until one day I decided
to put an end to it

727
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.713
and face the situation.
Then it was all over.

728
01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:24.845
Do you see why you have to
go in there now?

729
01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.474
Look. Here.

730
01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:34.100
Get a shake and the latest issue
of that magazine you like. okay?

731
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.268
When you come out. I promise
we'll never mention this again.

732
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:39.571
Okay. honey?

733
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.490
Go on.

734
01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:18.224
- Andrea. I can't talk now.
- Jon. no. wait.

735
01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:23.111
What?

736
01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.318
He's alive. He's very weak.

737
01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:28.571
but he's alive. It's like he's been
resuscitated. it's a miracle.

738
01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.821
Do you hear me?
You have to come.

739
01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.492
Then you were right.

740
01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.331
What?

741
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:40.167
I was the one who had to die.

742
01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:44.216
No. no. No one's going to die.

743
01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:46.968
- I have to go. Andrea.
- Jon. no. wait a moment.

744
01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:49.471
- Wait a moment. please.
- I love you very much.

745
01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:30.905
Whatever happens. don't go to
the 24-hour store on your birthday.

746
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.283
April 12. 2018.
If you do. you'll die.

747
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.425
I think that guy's
going to Rob the store.

748
01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:02.042
I told you I didn't want
to see you here again.

749
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:04.432
- Listen. it's going to happen again.
- Get out of here.

750
01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.528
What's this?

751
01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.487
It's for a boy. in 10 years' time.
You have to warn him.

752
01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:13.616
- Get out or I'll call the police.
- Fucking listen to me!

753
01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:15.947
It'll be on April 12.
in 10 years' time.

754
01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:18.953
Look at me closely. because the boy
will remind you of me.

755
01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.827
Get the fuck outta here!

756
01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:29.669
It's going to happen now.

757
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.061
Where's the older man?

758
01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:44.892
He took the day off.

759
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.401
It's going be now.

760
01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.160
No. no. don't shoot!

761
01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:07.578
Relax. man. Relax.

762
01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:14.418
- Take out your gun.
- I don't have a gun.

763
01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.679
Outside! Outside!

764
01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:56.752
Outside!

765
01:22:57.264 --> 01:22:58.264
Outside!

766
01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:02.299
Outside! Outside!

767
01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:03.934
On your knees!

768
01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.976
- Anyone else inside?
- No.

769
01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:11.979
- Are you sure? The bathroom?
- No. there's no one else!

770
01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.066
This doesn't fit.

771
01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:23.911
Here's the police.

772
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.915
Drop the gun before
something bad happens.

773
01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:42.555
Drop the gun!

774
01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.675
Drop the gun!

775
01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:49.201
Get out of here!

776
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.460
Drop the gun!

777
01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:53.296
Run!

778
01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:55.506
Run!

779
01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.886
Oh. shit! Drop the fucking gun!

780
01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:09.221
Last time! Drop the gun!

781
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.102
Go! Run!

782
01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:12.763
Toss the fucking gun!

783
01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:19.277
Run!

784
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:25.066
Nico!

785
01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:27.027
Run!

786
01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:56.273
Are you okay? Are you okay?

787
01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:08.239
Mom. I wasn't scared.

788
01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:11.037
I swear.

789
01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:13.449
I wasn't scared.

790
01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:07.719
Jon!

791
01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:17.726
He's alright? Is everything alright?

792
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:27.565
Jon.

793
01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:30.327
Jon.

794
01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:33.199

795
01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:50.011
