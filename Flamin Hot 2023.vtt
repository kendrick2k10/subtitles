[flamenco music playing]

4
00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.875
[narrator] Call a Mexican "spicy."
and you're playing with fire.

5
00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.000
But spicy?

6
00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:46.000
Yeah. See. that's how I got here.

7
00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:48.333
To this moment.

8
00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:52.375
Me. the most uneducated.
successful vato you'll ever meet.

9
00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:56.708
I served up my pride on a silver platter
more than once along the way.

10
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.833
With my head held high.
I worked my way through kitchens.

11
00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:03.708
chicken coops. mechanic shops.
breaking a sweat to make a dollar stretch.

[piano music playing]

13
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.625
[narrator] Until I got here.

14
00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:09.333
See. I'm the guy
who helped bring the world

15
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.375
the most popular snack it's ever seen.

16
00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:12.542
Here you go. ma'am.

17
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.042
[narrator] Nah. not that fool.

18
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.750
Yeah. that fine-looking guapo right there.

19
00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.375
looking like Sean Connery
dipped in Abuelita chocolate?

20
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.917
That's me.
El mero mero Mr. Richard Montañez.

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.708
See. but I didn't always schmooze
with the big dogs. Nah.

22
00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:27.708
See. I started at the bottom.

23
00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:33.417
[Richard] I mean the very bottom.
In a grape vineyard in Guasti. California.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.542
Yeah. that little travieso right there.

25
00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.500
Actually. one of nine traviesos .

26
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.750
I mean. it was the '60s. We're Mexican.
Of course my parents got down.

27
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.750
See. in my mind.
I was the luckiest kid in the world

28
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.708
with a playground bigger than Disneyland.

32
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.958
[Richard. in English]
We lived together. We worked together.

33
00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.583
And we survived together.

34
00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:06.542
And by the time I was ten.
I knew all I had in life was…

[children chattering]

46
00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:07.458
Let's just say
us two chiquillos had a lot in common.

47
00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:13.208
Hi.

48
00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:16.417
[in English] Yeah.

49
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.250
Wish it was a bologna sandwich or--
or a chocolate.

50
00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:24.167
[in English] Want some?

51
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.667
Ew! What is that? Gross.

52
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.000
It's a bean burrito.

53
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.500
Ha! Figures. Beans for a dirty beaner.

54
00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:31.833
-[bullies laugh]
-Let's go. guys.

55
00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:34.667
[Richard] Judy and I knew we stuck out
like a couple of sore brown thumbs.

56
00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.417
[Richard. in English]
So we decided to stick together.

57
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.167
Burritos and bullies be damned.

58
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:41.751

61
00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:00.000
[in English] Hey. There's the beaner. Ha.

62
00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:03.167
-He's eating it again. Gross. Look.
-Looks like it came out of a toilet.

63
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.875
[bully 1] Aw. I might throw up.
[imitates retching]

64
00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.500
Oh. my God!

65
00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.542
So good!

66
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:11.333
Delicioso.

67
00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.417
Want some?

68
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.583
Ew. I'm not gonna eat that!

69
00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:15.667
You eat it.

70
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.000
-[laughs]
-I dare you.

71
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.292
[whimpers]

72
00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.542
-Hey. this is pretty good.
-[bully 2] I want some. Give me one.

73
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.000
Me first. Give me this one.

74
00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:33.083
Twenty-five cents.

75
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.750
Let's go.

76
00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:41.833
[Richard] And just like that. I became
the burrito hustler of Guasti Elementary.

77
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.333
Ever heard of a little thing called
"supply and demand"?

78
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.833
-[student] Whoa! I want one.
-[students clamoring]

79
00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.500
[Richard] Man. Taco Bell didn't introduce
the world to burritos.

80
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.000
Me and my mama did.

81
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.625
Well. at least
that's what it felt like to me.

82
00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:57.375
[coins rattling]

83
00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:04.083
I wasn't gonna let another day go by
where Judy ate a sad sack lunch.

84
00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:07.667
My Jude wanted chocolate.
and she was gonna get it.

85
00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:11.208
You better have money for that.

86
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:17.417
[officer]
Where'd you steal that from. huh. boy?

87
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:22.042
[Richard]
Here's how this bronca could've gone.

88
00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.625
Gee. mister!

89
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.875
I made that money on my newspaper route.

90
00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.375
No funny business here.
Just a kid with a girl to impress.

91
00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.333
Well. look at this fine.
upstanding young citizen here. huh?

92
00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:33.417
[manager chuckles]

93
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.250
-Wow!
-[officer] Huh? [laughs]

94
00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.167
You go get that girl. son.

95
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.167
And you know what?
Have some free candy on the house.

96
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.292
-Ooh.
-[studio audience laughs. applauds]

97
00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:42.500
Ah. good-looking kid.

98
00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:44.042
-Yeah. smart too.
-Yeah.

-[record scratching]
-[police radio chatter]

100
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.792
[Richard] But I wasn't a white kid.

101
00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:49.375
I was brown.

102
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.125
[whispers. indistinct]

103
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.083
Get in.

104
00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:00.625
[Richard] And when the world treats
you like a criminal. you become one.

105
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:04.417
[police sirens wailing]

106
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:09.958
[Richard] Yeah! That's that firme pachuco
steez everyone was wearing in the '70s.

107
00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:11.958
[laughs] I look good!

108
00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.458
Now. before you start talking smack about

109
00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:16.958
"why Mexicans always
got to be gangsters." don't.

110
00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:18.917
'Cause I didn't make this up. I lived it.

111
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.250
You see. back then.

112
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:23.708
la policía believed they had the right
to beat your ass in the street

113
00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.042
if your name was González or Martínez.

114
00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:30.250
To be Chicano meant being invisible
but still getting a beatdown.

115
00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.375
And if la jura wasn't beating your ass.

116
00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:35.500
you were getting shipped off to war
to drop like flies.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:40.833

119
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:42.125
And Judy?

120
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:43.875
She was surviving too.

121
00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.708
And we were real good at surviving.

122
00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:48.167
Together.

123
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.417

124
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.708
[Richard]
The Chicano Movement was in full effect.

125
00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:55.542
but I wasn't paying attention.

126
00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.708
I had family business to attend to.

127
00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:03.333
You see. my homeys were
the only family I knew. you dig?

128
00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:05.750
We always had each other's backs.

133
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.833
[Richard] Business was good.

134
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.542
And I was living the life.

135
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:26.625
[Richard] But ignorance is bliss
until one of you wakes up.

136
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.875
Rich. you gotta change now.

137
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.250
-For us and for the baby.
-What you talking about?

138
00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:33.292
-Check out this new ride I got us.
-Yeah. exactly!

139
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:34.750

Rich. if I am sitting in a stolen car.
I swear--

142
00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:42.375
It's on a layaway plan.

143
00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.708
-Are you kidding me right now?
-[indistinct]

144
00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:47.042
Why do you keep doing stuff like this
all the time?

145
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.458
Look at me. son.

146
00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.000
You're not worthless. Richard.
Do you hear me?

147
00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:55.667
[judge] You're not stupid.

148
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.208
You've got a brain between those ears.
not just that dumb mustache.

149
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:03.083
You're not your father.
but you will be if you don't change.

end up in a cell or in the ground.

We can't lose you. Rich.

152
00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.292
And I think you can do better.

153
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:18.250
[Richard] Man. it's a miracle
he didn't throw the book at me.

154

Hey. vato!

[gangster 2. in English] Let's go!

161
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.542
[Richard] You see. life is about choices.

162
00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:41.375
Big ones.

163
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.583
It was time for me
to choose something better.

164
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.958
But better doesn't always mean easier.

165
00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:55.042

We don't have time.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:11.750
[crying continues]

174
00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:13.833
Here. Chew.

175
00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.667
You gotta hurry up. baby.
We're gonna be late.

176
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.792
[Richard] Yeah. yeah.

177
00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.375
-How the heck…
-Spit.

178
00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.833
-Put your leg up.
-[Richard] I think I got it.

179
00:09:22.917 --> 00:09:24.375
Okay. I think I got it.

180
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:27.250
All right. go. Go wait in the sala.

181
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.625
[refrigerator humming]

182
00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:29.708

[shouts]
[in Spanish]

184
00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:34.708
[in English] I fixed it.

185
00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:36.875
-[refrigerator sputters]
-[speaking Spanish]

186
00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.583
[in English]
Baby. that sounded really bad.

187
00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:41.917
[grunts] Bad? Nah.
No. the fridge is just taking a nap.

188
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.458
-The food is gonna spoil. Come on.
-The food will be fine.

189
00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:45.708
[sighs] What are we gonna do?

190
00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:47.375
-When are we gonna have time to fix it?
-Hey.

191
00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:49.208
-We can't afford another.
-Look at me.

192
00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:50.667
-What are we gonna do?
-Breathe.

193
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.083
[sighs]

194
00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:53.542
Three.

195
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:56.042
[inhales deeply] Two.

196
00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:58.542
One. [inhales deeply]

197
00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:00.708
-[inhales deeply] Breathe.
-Breathe.

198
00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:04.417
Someone's gonna say "yes" today.

199
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.250
Yeah.

200
00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:07.708
I got this.

201
00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:09.000
And I did have this.

202
00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:12.125
- Judy even made me a fancy résumé.
-Excuse me. Hey. man. How are you?

203
00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:14.708
'Cause who's gonna say "no" to something
that sounds so French?

204
00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:17.000
-We don't got no work. bro.
-Now. I can mow lawns.

205
00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.500
I can hedge the bushes.
I'll clean out the equipment.

206
00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:21.958
-Whatever you need.
-Sorry. man. My crew's full.

207
00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:25.292
Here's my number. Just call me anytime
if something opens up.

208
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.750
Excuse me.
Do you know where they might be hiring?

209
00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:30.083
My father and grandfather
were farmworkers.

210
00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:33.417
I was too when I was a kid so.
I-- I remember well.

211
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.042
If you could just take my résumé.

212
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.125

214
00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:41.958
Here's my résumé.

215
00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.750
And I'll do anything.
I'll wash dishes. Whatever.

216
00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:46.125
Don't hold your breath.

217
00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:48.917
-There you go.
-[both speaking Spanish]

218
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.333
[both speaking Spanish]

219
00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:56.458
[in English] Some people call it juvie.
I call it summer camp.

220
00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:58.083
[knocking]

221
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.042
[chuckles] Who needs a high school diploma
to stack a bunch of junk? Am I right?

222
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.875
[manager] We ain't hiring.

223
00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.500
You just don't look like the kind of guy
who's got an ounce of initiative.

224
00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:14.333
What kind of guy does that look like?

225
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.083
Hey. hey. hey! Hey! That's my car.

226
00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:20.250
Don't do that! You have respect
for other people's property. dang it!

227
00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:21.292
Hey. hey. hey!

228
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:23.625
-You understand me?
-Get your hands off my kid!

229
00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.083
Don't be talking to him like that.

230
00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:28.792
Good Lord! You women pump
these wetbacks out like a factory.

231
00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:32.125
-What did you just say?
-Hey! Hey! You touch my kid?

232
00:11:32.208 --> 00:11:34.000
-Leave it. Rich.
-What do you mean. "leave it"?

233
00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.500
Yes. leave it! The police will come.
and that's not good for us.

234
00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:37.917
[Lucky] Mommy?

235
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.583
What's a wetback?

236
00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:43.625
It's okay. baby.
You didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:45.292
-Okay. [kisses]
-[Lucky sobbing]

238
00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.083
-[baby crying]
-I know.

239
00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:52.542
We need to go in at some point. babe.

240
00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:55.458
I really don't want to.

241
00:11:55.542 --> 00:11:56.625
The kids need to eat.

242
00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:59.250
-We have food at home.
-No. we don't.

243
00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:01.625
The fridge just broke. We don't have work.

244
00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:03.125
You think I don't know that?

245
00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:08.083
Tortillas can't pay the bills.
and our kids have shoes that talk.

246
00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:09.208
We need help.

247
00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:13.042
Please just suck it up.
and let's go into Vacho's.

248
00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:15.875
[Spanish music playing]

249

[imitates screaming]

252
00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.125
[Vacho]

253
00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.833
[in English] It's not your job
to provide for your family.

254
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.625
It's this menso's job.

255
00:12:33.583 --> 00:12:35.167
What's the matter with you. huh?

256
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.000
Letting your woman work so much.

257
00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:40.542
If you read the Bible. you'd know it's
a man's job to provide for his family.

258
00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:42.042
[Richard] You heard that right. God.

259
00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.500
Vacho got saved about five years ago.

260
00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.083
He replaced the gin and juice
with some Jesus juice.

261
00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:50.374
You need to set an example for your kid.
Ain't that right. mijo?

262
00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:56.750
[in English] Yes. We both have. There's
just no work for anybody right now.

263
00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:59.417
Oh. there's work out there.
There's always work out there.

264
00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:02.833
Problem is. all they see is a good-
for-nothing gangster when they see you.

265
00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:05.167
-Mm-hmm.
-If you gave your life to the Lord.

266
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.208
you would see how fast
the help would come. mijo.

267
00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:10.875
Well. last time I checked. Jesus was poor.
prieto and powerless like me.

268
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.333
And he did some pretty gangster shit.

269
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.250
You wanna be a good husband
and father or what. huevón?

270
00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:17.708
[sighs]

271
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.875
Ya. Concha.
[in English] Stop it with the candle. huh?

272
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.792
-Ain't no candle gonna fix him.
-[Concha] Okay. Vacho.

273
00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:27.125
[Vacho] He needs to fix himself.

274
00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:29.833
Thank you. Concha. At this point.
I'll put my faith in anything.

275
00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:33.250
How about you forget about the stupid
candle and have a little faith in me. huh?

276
00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:34.750
Rich. are you serious?

277
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.792
[muffled hip-hop music playing]

278
00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:48.167
[Richard] It felt like I had no choice.

279
00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.917
I had to go back to what I knew best.

280
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:56.708
And if I wanted to start selling again.
I had to check in with the old crew.

281
00:13:57.292 --> 00:13:58.375
[partygoers laughing]

282
00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:08.208
[chattering]

283
00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.875
Órale. What's up. homeboy?

284
00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.167
-[Richard] What's up?
-It's the big dog.

285
00:14:17.042 --> 00:14:19.167
You finally back for more business. ese?

286
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.542
Depends.

287
00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:21.458
Oh. yeah?

288
00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:23.167
Oh. shit. Richard's back?

289
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.458
-'Sup? Órale.
-I got you. homey.

290
00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.583
Hey. check it out.

291
00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.208
This vato right here
could sell water to a whale. carnal.

292
00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:33.167
The baddest salesman on the block. homey.

293
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.333
Nah.

294
00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:35.833
[door slams]

295
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.083
Richard's good.

297
00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:41.125
[Richard] Every hood has a big brother.

298
00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:42.458
The jefe.

299
00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:44.583
The vato who runs everything on the block.

300
00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:47.333
That was Tony Romero.

301
00:14:47.417 --> 00:14:49.125
Listen. Tony. I know what I'm doing.

302
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:51.625
No. you don't. 'Cause you got babies.

303
00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:53.250
You don't need to sling nothing.

304
00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:55.417
Hey. man.
if he wants to deal. let him deal.

Yeah. homes.
we don't all got fancy factory jobs

306

312
00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:14.000
They hired this Mexican
Hulk-Hogan-looking pendejo.

313
00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:15.083
Why not me?

319
00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.208
Go get an application.

320

Who's stopping you?

321
00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:32.792
Just put in a good word.

322
00:15:34.042 --> 00:15:35.875
Like you said. I got kids.

Sure. mijo.

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.583
Excuse me. Sorry.

343
00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:49.125
Um. hi.

344
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:52.042
Um. my name is Richard Montañez.
I'm coming to bring a résumé.

345
00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:54.417
We don't take résumés.
You have to fill out an application.

346
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.875
And before you ask. no.
we don't have it in Spanish.

347
00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.333
Okay. thanks.

348
00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:31.833
[applicant] Here's my application.

349
00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:48.833
Hi. um. you think it'd be okay
if I brought this back later?

350
00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:50.917
Probably a good idea. hon.

351
00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:54.875
Thank you.

352
00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.167
[clears throat] Pen.

353
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.750
Oh. Sorry.

354
00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:00.542
Baby! [gasps]

355
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:01.833
Sofia got fired.

356
00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:08.083
[in English] So. guess who gets all
of her shifts at the store? This girl!

357
00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:12.500
So. I got us
the name-brand cornflakes to celebrate.

358
00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:13.583
[grunting]

359
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.083
Hey. what's wrong?

360
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.208
Baby. what's "initiative" mean?

361
00:18:19.292 --> 00:18:23.750
It means. uh. s-someone who can
take charge without being asked. Why?

362
00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:26.458
Do I look like a guy who's got initiative?

363
00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.625
What is it? Tell me.

364
00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:32.667
[clicks tongue] High school diploma.

365
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:35.958
You're applying to Frito-Lay?

366
00:18:36.042 --> 00:18:37.708
Yeah. but I got to be
a high school graduate.

367
00:18:37.792 --> 00:18:39.167
and I can barely read the application.

368
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.417
No. baby. that's okay. I'll help you.

369
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.833
[chuckles]

370
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.750
I need my wife to help me
fill out the application.

371
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:46.958
God. what an idiot.

372
00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:48.750
Hey! Stop it.

373
00:18:48.833 --> 00:18:50.583
Screw the diploma. Can you do the job?

374
00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:52.125
Yeah. I think so.

375
00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:54.167
Can you?

376
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.125
Yes. I can.

377
00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:58.542
Okay. well. guess what?

378
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:02.292
You graduated
from San Bernardino High School.

379
00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:04.292
Class of '71.

380
00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:05.625
Yeah?

381
00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:07.500
With honors. What's up?

382
00:19:07.583 --> 00:19:09.500
Okay. papi. let's not get crazy.

383
00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.333
Come on. They ain't gonna know.

384
00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:13.083
[clicking tongue]

385
00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:18.042
So. Tony says you're a good guy. [sighs]

386
00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:19.125
Yeah. I hope so.

387
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:24.167
You fill this out?

388
00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:25.792
Yeah.

389
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.583
You write like a girl.

390
00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:29.583
Thank you.

391
00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:32.000
San Bernardino High. huh? I went there.

392
00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:33.625
You did?

393
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:35.708
Remember Principal Grimaldi? [groans]

394
00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:37.125
Tough. Annoying.

395
00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:38.875
[chuckles] Heck. yeah. man.

396
00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.667
I hated that guy.

397
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.333
Principal Grimaldi is a woman.

398
00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.042
Yea-Yeah. but she was like--

399
00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:50.625
She was like-- like a woman
who felt like one of the guys.

400
00:19:51.417 --> 00:19:52.458
Okay.

401
00:19:53.042 --> 00:19:55.208
-All right.
-Look. um. sir!

402
00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:57.500
Look. I'm fast. I'm smart.

403
00:19:57.583 --> 00:19:59.458
I-- I know I don't look it.

404
00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:01.917
but I promise
I'll be the best worker you ever hired.

405
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.375
Look. maybe I don't got no diploma.
but I got a PhD.

406
00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:08.792
-Hmm?
-I'm poor. hungry and determined. sir.

407
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.250
Oh. well. that's just stupid.

408
00:20:12.917 --> 00:20:13.917
[sighs]

409
00:20:14.583 --> 00:20:15.833
Fine. [sighs]

410
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.250
Honestly. most of the Mexicans here
work pretty dang hard.

411
00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:21.375
It's a janitor gig. What's the worst
you could do? Break a mop?

412
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:22.458
But I won't.

413
00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:29.583
[Richard] For the first time in years.
this chavo had a legit grown-up job.

414
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:31.667
See. fools were jealous.

415
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.667
Shoot. I was jealous of me.

416
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.250
[forklift beeping]

417
00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:48.333
All right. you punch in on time.
You punch out on time. No exceptions.

418
00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:49.667
This here is the main pit.

419
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.708
Cornmeal goes in that extruder.
through the oven.

420
00:20:52.792 --> 00:20:55.917
Chips cool down in this tumbler.
Lots of grease. You'll be scrubbing that.

421
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.333
Right there are the fryers.

422
00:20:57.417 --> 00:20:59.458
You're gonna change the oil
on those every two days.

423
00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:01.458
Make sure you scrub the exterior too

424
00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:04.458
because it'll drip like a son of a gun
and muck up the floors.

425
00:21:04.542 --> 00:21:06.000
Could cause a lawsuit.

426
00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:09.000
And I don't need
a stinking lawsuit. got it?

427
00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:10.583
This here is the main walkway.

428
00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:14.458
Lot of forklifts
and traffic moving around. so be careful.

429
00:21:14.542 --> 00:21:17.417
[Richard] It was crazy.
Like a city of machines.

430
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.667
It was firme .

431
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.292
[chuckles]
This moreno was finally part of something.

432
00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:25.083
Something big.

433
00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:27.250
Here the chips are sorted.
weighed and bagged.

434
00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:30.708
Underneath there. those conveyors.
I want you to scrub right up under that.

435
00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:33.833
These bins are gonna wanna be
emptied out every hour.

436
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:36.667
Main trash bin is outside there
on the loading dock.

437
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.167
But. basically. don't get in anyone's way.

438
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.583
Montañez! Hey. you "comprende-ing"?

439
00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.083
Yes. sir!

440
00:21:46.167 --> 00:21:49.792
Cornmeal extruder. oil lawsuits.
every bin. every hour.

441
00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.333
I'll be the best dumper you ever had.

442
00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:54.208
Okay. I can see
you're gonna be a weird one.

443
00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:56.917
All right. this here is Nacho.
Nacho. Richard.

444
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.083
Nacho will fill you in on anything
I didn't explain.

445
00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:00.209
-Good luck.
-What do you need help with?

446
00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:03.917
[worker on PA] Packaging operator.
you're needed on the floor. please.

447
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Packaging operator.
you're needed on the floor.

448
00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:07.083
Wow!

449
00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.458
Hey. this is so cool. Have you seen this?

450
00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:19.208
[Richard. in English] Hey!

451
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.125
I got you. That's too heavy for you. vato.

452
00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:24.917
-[worker] Gracias. Gracias.
-[Richard] All right. [grunts]

453
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:27.333

[chattering on television]

455
00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:30.917
Amá. Dad's home!

456
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.667
Oh. my gosh! Baby. how did it go?
Did they like you? I was praying all day.

457
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.333
[chuckles]
Apá. they gave you free Cheetos?

458
00:22:37.417 --> 00:22:40.458
You know white people
don't give you no free nothing.
Plus… [in Spanish]

459
00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:45.708
-[in English] What we got. babe?
- Arroz con quesadillas.

460
00:22:45.792 --> 00:22:46.792
[Richard] Mmm.

461
00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:49.542
[groans] We always eat the same thing.

462
00:22:49.625 --> 00:22:52.833
Hey! You like my quesadillas. Here. Eat.

463
00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:54.667
Hey.

464
00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:58.000
-[clicks tongue] You proud of your man?
-Maybe.

465
00:22:58.083 --> 00:23:00.167
Start bringing home free food.
and I'll think about it.

466
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.125
-[chuckles]
- Chale.

467
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:03.292
[kisses]

468
00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:07.583
Babe. you got that candle burning 24-7.
You're gonna burn down the house.

469
00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:10.333
Hey! What are you doing. necio?
You trying to get fired?

470
00:23:10.417 --> 00:23:11.750
-I don't think so.
-[blows]

471
00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:14.042
-[chuckles] Brat. Stop it.
-What? It's so windy in here.

472
00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:15.875
-[blows]
-[laughs] I'm gonna get you!

473
00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:18.083
-Stop it!
-I won't do it. [blows]

474
00:23:22.708 --> 00:23:24.708
[power washer spraying]

475
00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:34.958
Hey. that was fun. man.

476
00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:38.458
I've never used a power washer before.
I didn't know they could clean like that.

477
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:41.167
You know what? I think if we used vinegar.
it would do really well.

478
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.708
Vin-- Judy has this-- You know what?

479
00:23:42.792 --> 00:23:44.750
I think she used baking soda.
That's what it is.

480
00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:48.833
[factory workers chattering]

481
00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:52.000
Oh. hey!

482
00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:54.750
So. you're telling me
that the cornmeal mixes with the water.

483
00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:57.333
goes into that machine. is like. "Poof!"

484
00:23:57.417 --> 00:23:59.042
Comes out shaped like a Cheeto?

485
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:02.875
But. like. how?

486
00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:04.167
Is it. um--

487
00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:06.542
Is it the heat plus the pressure?

488
00:24:08.083 --> 00:24:11.000
Don't you got a mop to flirt with
instead of me. Paco?

489
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.667
-[Richard] Man. I know guys like this.
-Okay.

490
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.375
I've dealt with them my whole life.

[shouts]

495
00:24:22.917 --> 00:24:25.417
[Richard] What'd you think?
This is my first week on the job.

496
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.000
I had to mind my gangster.

497
00:24:33.042 --> 00:24:35.083
Yeah. it's the heat plus the pressure.

498
00:24:38.042 --> 00:24:40.000
[worker 1]
Colettes look good to you. Baker?

499
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:41.958
Yeah.

500
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:47.625
Is that what they call the "temp levels."
or is that part of the machine?

501
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:50.333
Nah. man. The doodles. bro.
The Cheeto doodles are the colettes.

502
00:24:50.917 --> 00:24:53.042
[Richard] Oh. nice.
Hey. it's wild. isn't it?

503
00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:55.500
How all these gauges and gadgets
make a bunch of doodles.

504
00:24:55.583 --> 00:24:56.583
[supervisor] Montañez!

505
00:24:57.333 --> 00:25:00.500
Come on. The extruder's caked
in cheese dust. Clean it out!

506
00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:02.708
It's Montañez. sir!

508
00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:09.833
You got a cool job. brother!

509
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.667
Yes. I do. brother.

510
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.167
I'm an engineer.

511

Self-made.

512
00:25:16.792 --> 00:25:18.000
For real?

513
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.083
For real.

514
00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:21.167
Hey. hold up!

515
00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:24.958
[worker on PA]
Quality control. extension 334.

516
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.583
[tapping]

517
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.708
You push all them buttons
like you're a superhero.

518
00:25:37.792 --> 00:25:39.292
Like. pow-pow-pow!

519
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:40.875
[chuckles]

520
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:42.667
Hey. I'm Richard.

521
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.833
Richard Montañez.

522
00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:47.583
Clarence C. Baker.

523
00:25:47.667 --> 00:25:49.000
Órale.

524
00:25:49.083 --> 00:25:51.208
-Pleasure to meet you. hermano.
-Mm-hmm.

525
00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:52.542
Hey. what's the "C" stand for?

526
00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:54.417
Charisma.

527
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Oh. okay.

528
00:25:59.917 --> 00:26:01.542
Hey. I got a question.

529
00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:03.542
You think there might be a way
that I can look at--

530
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:05.167
Man. I don't even know what it's called.

531
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.875
It's. like. a diorama
or a diagram of this machine.

532
00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.458
Now. why would you wanna learn
about a machine I run. boy?

533
00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:13.583
Hey. hey. hey. hey. Uh. my bad. Clarence.

534
00:26:13.667 --> 00:26:16.667
The janitor got a little lost.
He was just looking for the cafeteria.

535
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.000
-Just come on.
-[Richard] I was just talking to him. man.

536
00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:22.000
Richie. don't be talking
to people like that. homey.

537
00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:23.792
This here's like high school. menso.

538
00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:26.000
Union guys ain't trying to talk
to no janitor.

539
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:28.458
I never been to high school.
I don't know what you're talking about.

540
00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:29.875
-[sighs] Come on. man.
-[worker laughs]

541
00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:31.500
New guy's already messing up?

542
00:26:31.583 --> 00:26:33.792
Oh. yeah! He's talking to Clarence
like he knows the guy.

543
00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:36.917
-You already met Nacho. This is Hector.
-Hey.

544
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.292
-That's Alejandro.
-How you guys doing?

545
00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:40.583
-[speaks Spanish]
-[in English] Pass me the salsa. yeah?

546
00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:44.542
[Tony. in English]
I don't like the green one. bro. Gracias.

547
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:50.375
[in English] Here's what you need to know
if you're gonna survive around here.

548
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:53.458
The guys at that table.
those are the plant managers.

549
00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:55.833
Calm. confident.

550
00:26:55.917 --> 00:26:58.708
They got white picket fences and 401(k)s.

551
00:26:58.792 --> 00:27:00.792
They got money. champagne.

552
00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:04.583
and no worries
because they got the cushy. safe jobs.

553
00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:06.708
Then. there's the floor managers.

554
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:10.917
They ain't got no job security.
but they got all the responsibility.

555
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.292
-[managers shouting]
-God dang it!

556
00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:14.500
[Tony] Poor bastards are bitter
because they gotta answer

557
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:17.333
to the guys above them
who do less and make more.

558
00:27:17.417 --> 00:27:20.417
Y luego . the machine operators.

559
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.917
Blue-collar but proud.
They get everybody's respect.

560
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.708
And Clarence. he's the best of them all.

561
00:27:26.792 --> 00:27:28.792
Homey's been here longer than anybody.

562
00:27:31.375 --> 00:27:32.917
[in English] Yeah. but why is that bad?

563
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.583
'Cause the compa has been trying
to get from that table

564
00:27:35.667 --> 00:27:39.083
to that table for 15 years.

565
00:27:39.167 --> 00:27:42.083
Half those cabrones at the top learned
everything they know from Clarence.

566
00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:44.917
There's a reason he doesn't like
getting questions about his machines.

567
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.458
- Exacto.
-And then. you got us.

568
00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:49.667
Lowest of the low.

569
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.625
-The assembly line. packing--
-[scoffs] Speak for yourself. homey.

570
00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:55.417
Us drivers are elite status. [chuckles]

571
00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:00.000
[Alejandro] Ooh! Ay. güey. Órale.

572
00:28:00.083 --> 00:28:01.583
[in English] And then there's you two.

573
00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:03.875
-Bottom-feeders. The janitors.
-[Alejandro. indistinct]

574
00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:08.500
[in English] Guys like you can't be
talking to a guy like Clarence.

575
00:28:09.125 --> 00:28:10.833
'Cause we don't break rank around here.

576
00:28:10.917 --> 00:28:12.000
Entiendes?

577
00:28:12.083 --> 00:28:13.167
It's about respect.

578
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.583
And guys like you and me.
we don't get shots like this.

579
00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:16.667
So don't blow it.

580
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.333
'Cause I'm not going back
to that life. carnal.

581
00:28:19.417 --> 00:28:20.667
Are you?

582
00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:24.375
[Richard grunts]

583
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.042
[grunts]

584
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.375
You should see the machines.

585
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:32.750
Oh. and I got my own little office
y todo. Amá.

586
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.750
[in English] An office. huh?
You mean more like a closet. que no?

587
00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.167
Where you stuff the cleaning supplies.

588
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.750
Man. it ain't no closet.

589
00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:45.792
Nacho and I share a desk in there.
We got a phone and everything.

590
00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:47.833
Ah. still a dead end. sangrón.

591
00:28:47.917 --> 00:28:49.167
It's a job.

592
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.667
Provide for my family.

593
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.750
Yeah. for how long?

594
00:28:53.583 --> 00:28:54.792
[in English]
Until you change your insides.

595
00:28:54.875 --> 00:28:56.458
you're gonna keep
making the same mistakes.

596
00:28:56.542 --> 00:28:58.500
You can't spend
the rest of your life scrubbing floors

597
00:28:58.583 --> 00:28:59.958
and cleaning up after people.

598
00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:02.875
[Richard] I would never say
Vacho was right. but he wasn't wrong.

599
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:04.958
I didn't wanna mop floors my whole life.

600
00:29:05.042 --> 00:29:07.000
I was working hard to get to the top.

601
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.208
And you know who was at the top?

602
00:29:09.292 --> 00:29:12.542
That vato right there. Roger Enrico.

603
00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:15.917
He ran PepsiCo.
which ran Frito-Lay. which ran us.

604
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.458
He created the Pepsi Generation
and a blind taste test challenge

605
00:29:19.542 --> 00:29:21.750
that became
a national marketing sensation.

606
00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:26.583
This vato is the only guy to almost take
down Coca-Cola in nearly 100 years.

607
00:29:26.667 --> 00:29:28.583
Pepsi was ballin' thanks to this G.

608
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:33.583
If I was gonna get to the top.
I needed to learn from the best.

609
00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:36.500
And Clarence? Clarence was the best.

610
00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:37.833
I couldn't mess around.

611
00:29:37.917 --> 00:29:41.042
I needed to pull out the big guns.
Los cuetes . baby.

612
00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:42.917
You want carnitas or asada?

613
00:29:44.625 --> 00:29:45.625
Flank steak?

614
00:29:47.167 --> 00:29:48.167
Asada?

615
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.292
Asada.

616
00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:56.042
Okay. what do you want?

617
00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:58.917
I wanna say that I respect your work. sir.

618
00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:01.875
Uh. that I respect that you're self-made.

619
00:30:02.458 --> 00:30:03.625
An engineer.

620
00:30:05.583 --> 00:30:06.667
I wanna learn from you.

621
00:30:08.083 --> 00:30:10.083
Look. my father ain't worth nothing.

622
00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:12.375
but he taught me a lot
about fixing stuff as a kid.

623
00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:14.875
So. I got a thing for machines.

624
00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:19.375
Like when I learn them and fix them
and run 'em. it makes me feel like--

625
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.500
I don't know. Like I ain't a nobody.

626
00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:25.583
Maybe even like I am a somebody.

627
00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:31.292
Somebody that gives out respect
to people he's barely met

628
00:30:32.167 --> 00:30:33.250
that haven't even earned it?

629
00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:38.125
'Cause I ain't that kinda somebody.

630
00:30:38.208 --> 00:30:40.542
[Richard] Dang.
if I was gonna learn anything here.

631
00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:41.833
it was gonna be from this guy.

632
00:30:41.917 --> 00:30:44.917
But he was shut up tighter
than a jar of chipotles.

633
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.042
Right.

634
00:30:47.958 --> 00:30:49.750
You got some salsa or what?

635
00:30:51.292 --> 00:30:52.333
Yeah.

636
00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:57.667
-[Clarence] What are we talkin'? Spicy?
-[Richard] Oh. yeah.

637
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.625
-[Clarence] Good.
-[Richard] Be careful with that one.

638
00:30:59.708 --> 00:31:03.208
[Richard] Clarence C. Baker.
He was respected and smart as hell.

639
00:31:03.292 --> 00:31:06.167
And get this. his middle name
really was Charisma.

640
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.958
All right. Got your machine all shiny.
Mr. Baker. What ya think?

641
00:31:09.958 --> 00:31:10.958
You missed the vent.

642
00:31:11.042 --> 00:31:13.042
-What?
-[chuckles]

643
00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:14.167
Dang.

644
00:31:23.417 --> 00:31:24.417
[in English] Richie!

645
00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.375
Hey. Mr. Baker. Sir!

646
00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:30.125
I was reviewing the extruder protocols.
and it looks like this gauge is off.

647
00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:32.750
-Do you want me to adjust it? I know how.
-No. no. no. no.

648
00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.292
This gauge ain't off.

649
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.875
Hmm. Must've been Alejandro
touchin' my dang machine again.

650
00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:43.625
Thanks.

651
00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:51.750
Hey. Clarence. some of these chips
are looking overcooked.

652
00:31:51.833 --> 00:31:53.083
Should the heat be adjusted?

653
00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:57.000
Nah. brown ones
are separated and then tossed.

654
00:31:58.583 --> 00:31:59.833
They just trash 'em?

655
00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:01.250
Dang.

656
00:32:02.708 --> 00:32:04.792
People always trying
to throw away the brown ones.

657
00:32:08.958 --> 00:32:11.542
Montañez. you missed a spot.

658
00:32:11.625 --> 00:32:12.625
[laughing]

659
00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:14.125
Watch yourself. Carson.

660
00:32:15.417 --> 00:32:17.375
[clicks tongue] I'm always missin' a spot.

661
00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:20.542
[Clarence] Hey.

662
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.625
Leave it.

663
00:32:23.625 --> 00:32:24.875
Come with me.

664
00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:26.708
Stand right there…

665
00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:29.250
[machines whirring]

666
00:32:29.333 --> 00:32:30.458
…and listen.

667
00:32:30.542 --> 00:32:33.208
[whirring continues]

668
00:32:38.417 --> 00:32:40.375
Gasket's loose in station seven.

669
00:32:42.958 --> 00:32:45.000
That's all I got to do. is listen.

670
00:32:45.583 --> 00:32:51.250
I can tell you which machine.
belt. drum. valve or motor that's off.

671
00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:55.083
All by keeping my mouth shut
and listening.

672
00:32:55.167 --> 00:32:58.167
[whirring continues]

673
00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:03.333
I can't hear it.

674
00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:06.583
Oh. you will when I'm done with you.

675
00:33:08.417 --> 00:33:10.458
You ain't a nobody. son.

676
00:33:15.792 --> 00:33:16.792
[Richard] Heck yeah.

677
00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:18.833
I was officially his protégé.

678
00:33:19.542 --> 00:33:22.875
But I had to learn it on my own time.
before and after my shifts.

679
00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:24.083
But it didn't matter.

680
00:33:24.167 --> 00:33:26.958
I was ready.
I knew I could do more and be more.

681
00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:28.667
-Hey. I got to go.
-Wait. why?

682
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.333
Your shift doesn't start till later.

683
00:33:30.417 --> 00:33:32.708
[kisses] Because Clarence said
if I got there early.

684
00:33:32.792 --> 00:33:35.292
-he'd show me how to use the tumbler!
-The what?

685
00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:37.708
-Always very small movements.
-Yeah. but I know this.

686
00:33:37.792 --> 00:33:39.583
-[stammers]
-How that work?

687
00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:40.667
Stop.

688
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:46.833
Montañez. you ain't done. Come on.

689
00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:48.750
Yeah! Hey. maybe the wire burned out.

690
00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:50.292
No. it's just oxidized.

691
00:33:51.167 --> 00:33:52.292
Plug it back in.

692
00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:54.833
[machine starts]

693
00:33:56.875 --> 00:33:58.750
-Hey. you going on break. brother?
-[Clarence] Yeah.

694
00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:00.167
I got you. I'll watch your machine.

695
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.750
[applause]

696
00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:06.792
[Richard] Just when things
were going great for me.

697
00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:10.875
the country's economy went to shit.

698
00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:14.875
[newscaster] This is NBC Nightly News .

699
00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:18.042
This was the day
Ronald Reagan has been waiting for

700
00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:19.958
since he first entered politics.

701
00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.792
The day he will announce
that he is slowing down the growth

702
00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:24.292
of the federal government.

703
00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:26.750
[Richard] Man.
these Reagan years weren't kind to nobody.

704
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.833
Nothing trickling down
to the pobres and prietos like us.

705
00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:32.958
[reporter] Deep cuts are planned
for programs designed for the poor.

706
00:34:33.042 --> 00:34:36.375
such as food stamps.
Medicaid. and employment programs.

707
00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:39.542
[person 1] I already have a hard time
keeping the roof over my kid's head.

708
00:34:39.625 --> 00:34:41.583
And now I'm making too much
money for food stamps?

709
00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:43.625
[person 2] How do they expect me
to feed my family?

710
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:46.750
-[Richard] The factory was struggling.
-[person 2] I can't even afford my rent.

711
00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:48.875
[Richard]
I didn't know politics affect people.

712
00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:50.875
especially hardworking people like us.

713
00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:53.125
[person 3]
Hispanics are much poorer now than we were

714
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:55.542
before the Reagan administration
came into power.

715
00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:57.250
[Richard] As the years passed around here.

716
00:34:57.333 --> 00:35:01.417
layoffs and shift cuts got more popular
than Koosh balls and parachute pants.

717
00:35:02.417 --> 00:35:08.250
And here I was. eight years later.
in the exact same spot.

718
00:35:09.875 --> 00:35:12.375
[chuckles] Not even. Things were worse.

719
00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:14.083
[social worker] Yes. you qualify for SNAP.

720
00:35:14.167 --> 00:35:16.625
With dependents. you can siphon off
more than enough food stamps--

721
00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:18.042
Excuse me. what do you mean "siphon"?

722
00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:19.875
-We're hardworking. We both have jobs.
-Stop. Mom.

723
00:35:19.958 --> 00:35:22.042
-We're trying to figure this out.
-Mom. you're embarrassing us!

724
00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.792
You're going to make us feel bad
for wanting help?

725
00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:25.833
-[clamoring]
-[worker] What are we supposed to do?

726
00:35:25.917 --> 00:35:26.917
[supervisor] Hey. hey.

727
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.292
Quiet down. please. Okay?

728
00:35:28.375 --> 00:35:30.125
Quiet down! Hey!

729
00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:32.125
Frito-Lay isn't getting enough orders

730
00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:34.750
to keep both our factory
and Bakersfield open.

731
00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:35.667
[workers grumble]

732
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.708
[supervisor]
So I'm gonna be brutally honest.

733
00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:41.917
Losing bulk orders
to Bakersfield is now lethal.

734
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.333
If we cannot outrun 'em.
we are the ones who will get shut down.

735
00:35:46.417 --> 00:35:47.667
Understand?

736
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.500
Now. let's go! Back to work!

737
00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:51.417
[Richard]
The snack wars were getting serious.

738
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.167
Competition was thick
and market share was shrinking.

739
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.625
You see. Roger Enrico had become the CEO
of PepsiCo. and he didn't mess around.

740
00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:00.875
So his first order of business:

741
00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:05.042
cut the fat. cut shifts.
shut down factories.

742
00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:07.250
and find the money
to keep this ship moving.

743
00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:11.125
The corporate suite at Frito-Lay felt like
gangsters throwing down in a drug den.

744
00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:15.542
'Cause. let's be real. that's pretty much
what C-suiters are. Gangsters with money.

745
00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:16.667
Enrico was pissed.

746
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.667
He was like.
"You pendejos are out here tellin' me

747
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.958
these little punks
like Nabisco and Eagle Snacks

748
00:36:25.042 --> 00:36:27.292
are getting more feria than us?

749
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:31.417
Biting off our territory.
and youse estúpidos okay with that?"

750
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.833
And this gabacho was all. "Nah. big homey.

751
00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:37.250
We still got the good stuff.

752
00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:40.333
Cheetos. Fritos. Doritos.

753
00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:43.750
People still dishin' out lana
for the classics. bro."

754
00:36:43.833 --> 00:36:46.542
Then the big homey laid it down.
and he was like.

755
00:36:46.625 --> 00:36:48.042
[speaking Spanish]

756
00:36:48.125 --> 00:36:49.708
[in English] "For how long?

757
00:36:49.792 --> 00:36:52.792
'Cause we ain't got time. little puppet."

758
00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:55.958
What? You need a chola translator?
All right. I got you.

759
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:01.042
So. sales are down?

760
00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:04.000
-Yeah.
-Unfortunately.

761
00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:06.083
-Yeah. that's what it looks like.
-Right now.

762
00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:11.583
-Hey. Stephanie.
-Hey. Richard.

763
00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:14.125
Any word on my application
for the machinist job?

764
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:16.083
Sorry. Richard. There are no openings yet.

765
00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.167
[sighs]

766
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.375
Don't worry. hon.
You'll be the first to know. I'll call ya.

767
00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:20.333
-All right.
-Thank you.

768
00:37:20.417 --> 00:37:22.000
[Richard]
Everyone's shifts kept getting cut.

769
00:37:22.917 --> 00:37:26.000
Didn't matter if you were at the top
or the bottom of the food chain.

770
00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:27.500
[workers harmonizing]

771
00:37:27.583 --> 00:37:30.708
[Richard] Hmm. at least I wasn't alone.
We were all struggling.

772
00:37:30.792 --> 00:37:33.875
Struggling to feed our families.
Struggling to keep our homes.

773
00:37:33.958 --> 00:37:35.750
Struggling to save our pride.

774
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.125
So we did what Mexicans do best.

775
00:37:38.667 --> 00:37:40.917
We shoved it down
and tried to keep our heads up.

776
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.417
even while we were drowning.

777
00:37:53.292 --> 00:37:54.292
[slurps]

778
00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:16.333
[blows]

779
00:38:16.958 --> 00:38:17.958
[Steven] Apá.

780
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.875
Can't sleep?

781
00:38:31.917 --> 00:38:34.708
[dog barking]

782
00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:38.375
[Hector]
Hey. you sure you don't wanna go home?

783
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:39.583
Nah. man. I'm sure.

784
00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:43.417
Man. you crazy. I don't work free 99.

785
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.583
Yeah. well. when someone in the factory
needs a shift covered.

786
00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:46.583
who they gonna call?

787
00:38:46.667 --> 00:38:48.000
Ghostbusters.

788
00:38:48.083 --> 00:38:49.458
[Richard] You got jokes.

789
00:38:49.542 --> 00:38:52.375
They're gonna call the vato loco
who knows how to do everything.

790
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:54.833
[panting]

791
00:38:56.625 --> 00:39:00.125
All you got to know. vato loco.
is rotation is the key.

792
00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:02.958
Out with the old. in with the new.

793
00:39:04.583 --> 00:39:05.958
They're all old.

794
00:39:06.042 --> 00:39:10.958
Yeah. well. brown neighborhood.
white flavors. Do the math.

795
00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.583
I mean. who eats Cool Ranch anyway?

796
00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:16.042
Excuse me.

797
00:39:20.042 --> 00:39:21.208
That lady.

798
00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:24.125
We need to focus on the stockholders.
They control the purse strings.

799
00:39:24.208 --> 00:39:27.333
No. it's the regional managers who need
the oars to turn this ship around.

800
00:39:27.417 --> 00:39:29.250
What? The stockholders are chopped liver?

801
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.333
They need answers.
This video should give it to them.

802
00:39:31.417 --> 00:39:34.667
-Everything isn't about the stockholders.
-Whoa. Whoa. whoa. whoa. guys. guys.

803
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.583
I don't need stockholders
or regional managers or scripts.

804
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.167
I'm gonna just speak from the heart today.

805
00:39:42.708 --> 00:39:45.167
Okay? To the people who matter.

806
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.417
[boom mic operator] Mic's hot.

807
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.000
[sighs] Gentlemen.

808
00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:50.875
-Three. two. one. let's shoot it.
-[camera operator] Okay. Ready to roll.

809
00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:52.125
[workers chattering]

810
00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:55.375
Okay. everybody. we have
some entertainment for today's lunch.

811
00:39:56.083 --> 00:40:00.500
Garza. hey! Give me a hand here.
We've got to plug it in somewhere.

812
00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:03.708
All right. [grunts]

813
00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:06.375
Yeah. that's the thing. [sighs]

814
00:40:10.542 --> 00:40:12.375
Okay. Enjoy the show.

815
00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:14.333
Hey. man. What's that?

816
00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:18.250
Corporate nonsense.
They make me play this crap all the time.

817
00:40:18.333 --> 00:40:20.792
Watch it. Ignore it. I don't care.

818
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:22.375
[sighs]

819
00:40:23.542 --> 00:40:26.792
Hello. I'm Roger Enrico.
chairman of Frito-Lay.

820
00:40:27.417 --> 00:40:33.708
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm here
speaking directly to you. our workforce.

821
00:40:34.292 --> 00:40:37.667
You. my friend.
are the heart and soul of this company.

822
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.000
[Richard] Turns out Enrico sounded
more like Mister Rogers than American Me .

823
00:40:41.083 --> 00:40:43.125
[Roger] …machines running
and the product moving.

824
00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:49.042
Now. the world. the economy.
the factory is going through a hard time.

825
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:50.708
I know you've felt it.

826
00:40:51.292 --> 00:40:54.583
But. for every challenge.
there is opportunity.

827
00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:58.542
And this is your opportunity. Richard.

828
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.958
Yeah. you with the broom.
You see anyone else watching?

829
00:41:06.917 --> 00:41:09.208
Me? I'm just a janitor.

830
00:41:09.708 --> 00:41:13.333
So? Show the world what a janitor can do.

831
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:18.583
Every person can be the difference
between failure and success.

832
00:41:19.167 --> 00:41:24.417
Richard. I want you to think like a CEO.

833
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.500
Think like a CEO.

834
00:41:26.583 --> 00:41:29.458
[Roger] Stock prices are rising.
And in the foreseeable future…

835
00:41:29.542 --> 00:41:30.792
-[grunts]
- …we should get our…

836
00:41:33.125 --> 00:41:34.125
[child shouts]

837
00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:38.958
-[Steven] Papi!
-[child] Can't wait.

838
00:41:39.042 --> 00:41:40.083
Hey!

839
00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.167
[grunts] How was your day?

840
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.250
-Good.
-Yeah?

841
00:41:44.792 --> 00:41:47.042
Hey. What the hell happened to you?

842
00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:49.208
Let's just go home.

843
00:41:49.292 --> 00:41:51.042
Nah. not before
I beat these little punks up.

844
00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:52.917
-Hey!
-No. Dad. let's just go home!

845
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.625
Can we get some elotes first?

846
00:41:54.708 --> 00:41:57.750
No! Why do we always gotta do
stupid Mexican stuff?

847
00:41:57.833 --> 00:42:00.042
Hey! What's the matter with you?

848
00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:06.542
Don't look at me. I love elote.
I love beans. I love rice. I love tamales.

849
00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:09.875
He's just mad 'cause kids make fun of him
'cause we're Mexican.

850
00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:11.333
-Man. shut up!
-Hey. you shut up!

851
00:42:11.417 --> 00:42:12.917
-Hey! Knock it off.
-Hey!

852
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.833
Stop.

853
00:42:17.042 --> 00:42:18.042
Is that true?

854
00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:21.542
Are some little pricks picking on you?

855
00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:23.625
[sighs]

856
00:42:26.125 --> 00:42:28.417
Look. there's a lot
we can be embarrassed about.

857
00:42:29.167 --> 00:42:31.375
But being Mexican?
Nah. mijo. that ain't one of 'em.

858
00:42:31.458 --> 00:42:32.792
You're embarrassed.

859
00:42:33.708 --> 00:42:34.875
No. I'm not.

860
00:42:36.583 --> 00:42:39.000
And you know why
they don't want you to be Mexican?

861
00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:41.458
Because they know it's a superpower.

862
00:42:43.167 --> 00:42:46.792
They know that if you are proud of
who you are. that they couldn't stop you.

863
00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:49.250
That they couldn't make you feel
like you're less than them.

864
00:42:50.625 --> 00:42:51.875
Because you're not. mijo.

865
00:42:54.542 --> 00:42:58.292
They know that superpower--
that superpower can knock 'em out.

866
00:42:58.792 --> 00:43:02.417
Like-- Like Superman. [chuckles]

867
00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:05.542
I ain't four no more. Dad.

868
00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:10.458
Plus. no one craps on Superman
like they crap on us.

869
00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:12.958
[sighs]

870
00:43:20.292 --> 00:43:25.375
Come on. We're getting elote. Right now.

871
00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:29.042
[children laughing. chattering]

872
00:43:29.125 --> 00:43:30.458
Ow. ow. ow. ow. ow!

873
00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:32.083
What is it?

874
00:43:32.167 --> 00:43:33.167
It burns!

875
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:34.750
Well. stop eating it. dummy.

876
00:43:34.833 --> 00:43:37.333
No! I like it. It burns good.

877
00:43:55.042 --> 00:43:57.167
[Richard]
I'd been searching for an answer.

878
00:43:57.833 --> 00:43:59.125
Or a door to open.

879
00:43:59.625 --> 00:44:04.208
[laughs] And there it was. all around me.

880
00:44:05.458 --> 00:44:08.125
It had been there the entire time.

881
00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:12.542
-Mom!
-Mom!

882
00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:13.833
-[Richard] Jude!
-Mommy!

883
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:15.667
Enrico sent me a video!

884
00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:19.667
The candle was out.
I fixed it. and Enrico sent me a video.

885
00:44:20.542 --> 00:44:21.792
My candle sent you a video?

886
00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.000
[Richard] Yeah!

887
00:44:23.792 --> 00:44:25.875
-Lucky. baby. what happened?
-[Lucky mutters]

888
00:44:25.958 --> 00:44:28.167
-Nah. nah. He's all right. Eh?
-What?

889
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.958
He's not four anymore.
Plus. we already talked about it.

890
00:44:31.042 --> 00:44:33.333
[inhales deeply]
We're working on our superpowers.

891
00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:36.000
O no? All right. Go get some bowls.

892
00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:39.333
Mommy! We're gonna make chile chips
and save everybody's jobs.

893
00:44:39.417 --> 00:44:41.875
-We just needed time. you. and the recipe.
-Okay.

894
00:44:43.583 --> 00:44:45.458
-[Richard] Hey. put this in a bowl.
-Okay.

895
00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:46.583
Get a move on.

896
00:44:46.667 --> 00:44:49.708
And while you do that. Rich.
how do we pay rent? Huh?

897
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.958
How do we buy food? How?
How do we survive?

898
00:44:53.042 --> 00:44:54.458
We'll be okay.

899
00:44:54.542 --> 00:44:56.333
God. baby. I can't do this anymore.

900
00:44:56.417 --> 00:44:58.833
-No. no. no. no. no. Hey. hey. hey.
-Oh. my Gosh.

901
00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:00.625
Cálmate.

902
00:45:00.708 --> 00:45:01.792
Breathe.

903
00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:03.917
Three…

904
00:45:05.417 --> 00:45:07.375
-Two!
-Two!

905
00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:11.833
One. Breathe.

906
00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:15.625
[breathes deeply]

907
00:45:19.042 --> 00:45:20.042
Baby…

908
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.583
Vacho found a job for you.

909
00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:26.083
-[clicks tongue. sighs]
-It's a full-time job.

910
00:45:26.167 --> 00:45:29.167
Why can't you just talk to him?
For me. please.

911
00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:32.208
And then--
And then I will do this for you.

912
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.583
Yeah. okay.

913
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.208
Okay.

914
00:45:37.292 --> 00:45:38.167
[chip crunches]

915
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:41.042
-Hey! You eating the product?
-[Steven] Sorry.

916
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.458
Clarence. you gotta believe me.
They got potential.

917
00:45:46.542 --> 00:45:48.667
I just need the product to start sampling.

918
00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:50.542
We got to innovate. remember?

919
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:53.417
We could cover every Dorito.
Frito and Cheeto with this stuff

920
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.583
and get more orders.
More orders means more shifts.

921
00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:58.417
So. Frito-Lay is gonna make them
because the janitor said so?

922
00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.833
Now. Mr. Enrico said that--

923
00:45:59.917 --> 00:46:02.750
Roger Enrico?
We're talking about the guys at the top.

924
00:46:02.833 --> 00:46:06.417
You ain't at the top. I ain't at the top.
Those guys up there are.

925
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.958
[stammers] Wait. sometimes we just gotta
show 'em what the burrito's worth.

926
00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:11.500
What does that even mean. son?

927
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:15.000
It may look like it's worthless. but
if people just took a bite. they'd see.

928
00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:18.625
Someone took a chance on you. didn't they?
You got on that machine somehow.

929
00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:21.250
If they took a chance on you again.
you'd run this whole damn place.

930
00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:23.583
-Of course I would.
-Because you believe it.

931
00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:25.167
And I believe in this.

932
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.125
And I know it sounds crazy.
but what else is there to do?

933
00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:29.625
Lose our jobs? Go hungry?

934
00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:35.208
You got a point.

935
00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:40.542
[Tony] Yo. what are you doing?
Eating all the Cheetos?

936
00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:41.958
So I got a plan. carnal.

937
00:46:42.042 --> 00:46:45.250
All right. So I was talking to Clarence.
This is what we're gonna do.

938
00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:46.500
[laughing]

939
00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:48.958
[Richard]
We had it all to gain and nothin' to lose.

940
00:46:49.042 --> 00:46:53.333
We were just a bunch of brown chips
on a conveyor belt. waitin' to get tossed.

941
00:46:57.208 --> 00:46:59.125
-Thank you. brother. All right.
-[Nacho speaking Spanish]

942
00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:00.833
[in English] Almost forgot your Cheetos.

943
00:47:00.917 --> 00:47:01.917
Hey.

944
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:05.000
That's the Doritos. Fritos. Cheetos.

945
00:47:05.083 --> 00:47:08.083
Hey. Don't get your hopes up too high.
Okay. fool?

946
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:09.750
[horn honks]

947
00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:13.458
[Spanish hip-hop playing on radio]

948
00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:14.542
[whistles]

949
00:47:15.167 --> 00:47:16.500
You kickin' with these fools again?

950
00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:17.583
[gangster] Tony. let's go!

951
00:47:17.667 --> 00:47:20.042
You take care of your family.
I take care of mine.

952
00:47:23.083 --> 00:47:25.750
[Richard] Yeah.
Tony had to go back to that drug life.

953
00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:27.375
'Cause his mom was battling cancer.

954
00:47:27.458 --> 00:47:30.375
and he didn't have any money
to pay for doctor bills.

955
00:47:31.292 --> 00:47:34.042
We were all gonna do whatever it takes
to take care of our families.

956
00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.000
It's a full-time job. mijo.

957
00:47:36.667 --> 00:47:38.417
That's good. Full-time's good.

958
00:47:39.625 --> 00:47:42.250
Like Pastor Marco said.
after a year. you'll move on up.

959
00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:43.917
-[Lucky laughs]
-Ain't that right. Pastor?

960
00:47:44.917 --> 00:47:46.250
-[in English] Hey. boys. come on.
-Ow.

961
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.167
[in English]
So. I would go from being a janitor

962
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.125
to being a janitor?

963
00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:02.833
And. hopefully.
si me pongo las pilas. and I'm lucky.

964
00:48:02.917 --> 00:48:05.583
I'm gonna maybe be janitor-in-chief?
President of the janitors?

965
00:48:05.667 --> 00:48:08.208
King of the janitors?

966
00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:10.750
Nah. I'm good.

967
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.000
I think I'll stick with Frito-Lay.
where I have a real future.

968
00:48:16.792 --> 00:48:20.083
Better the devil you know
than the devil you don't. eh. Vacho?

969
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.333
Don't be stupid. mijo. They don't believe
in you or care about you.

970
00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:25.417
And you do?

971
00:48:26.333 --> 00:48:28.583
All that ever comes out of your mouth
is what an idiot I am.

972
00:48:28.667 --> 00:48:30.958
That I ain't worth shit.
I can't do nothin' right.

973
00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:33.208
You expect me to trust you
when you say God believes in me?

974
00:48:33.292 --> 00:48:34.625
He does.

975
00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:36.708
According to the Book of Vacho.

976
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.458
[in English]
You respect me in front of my company--

977
00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:41.542
Respect you?

978
00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:47.500
Hey. check it out. Pastor.

979
00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:51.333
I bet you didn't know that
he beat the shit out of me my whole life.

980
00:48:52.292 --> 00:48:56.583
But it doesn't bother me.
Because I got thick skin and a hard skull.

981
00:48:57.333 --> 00:48:58.833
You know what really sucks. Apá?

982
00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:04.750
Is that I hear your voice in my head.
beating my brain every day.

983
00:49:06.167 --> 00:49:10.375
And for some reason.
that's the beating I can't get up from.

984
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:13.583
I'm just trying to help.

985
00:49:13.667 --> 00:49:14.750
-Back off.
-[Judy] Hey. baby.

986
00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:17.292
It's getting so bad. your wife is looking
for help behind your back.

987
00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:18.833
She's lost all faith in you.

988
00:49:18.917 --> 00:49:20.292
-Hey. hey. hey!
-[Richard] What?

989
00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:23.042
You do not speak for me. Vacho.
and you sure as hell don't speak for God.

990
00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:27.083
Richard. look at me. I did not say
that I didn't have faith in you.

991
00:49:28.042 --> 00:49:30.375
I know what Richard is.
and I know what he isn't.

992
00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:33.875
Not educated? Sure.
But he is the smartest person that I know.

993
00:49:34.917 --> 00:49:36.750
He already knows God.

994
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.875
You wanna save someone? Save yourself.

995
00:49:40.792 --> 00:49:43.833
And then you come to him
when you're the father that he needs.

996
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.208
Come on. baby.
We're gonna go put my voice in your head.

997
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.958
Come on. kids. We're leaving. Let's go.

998
00:49:51.042 --> 00:49:52.292
[Steven] I don't want to go.

999
00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:53.625
[Lucky] Come on. Just go.

1000
00:50:00.083 --> 00:50:01.583
Let's go. guys. Get in the car.

1001
00:50:06.417 --> 00:50:10.125
Hey. If we're gonna make those güeritos
sweat. we're gonna get the good stuff.

1002
00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:15.833
[Richard] To be the best.
you had to get the best. Homegrown. baby.

1003
00:50:16.583 --> 00:50:20.708
Chile molido. chile fresco.
chile guajillo. chile piquín.

1004
00:50:20.792 --> 00:50:22.917
I mean. you name it.
we cleared the shelves of it.

1005
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Baby. get the red chile.

1006
00:50:24.083 --> 00:50:26.125
-I can't. Mom.
-Yes. you can. Papá. Come on.

1007
00:50:30.292 --> 00:50:32.125
Jude. which chiles do you want?

1008
00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:33.583
All of 'em. babe.

1009
00:50:33.667 --> 00:50:35.875
[Richard] No chile was left unturned.

1010
00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:38.875
Jude! Jalapeños or serranos?

1011
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.375
Hey. babe! I found some güeritos.

1012
00:50:42.458 --> 00:50:46.000
Okay. baby. Which one you wanna try?
The Cheetos? Fritos? Doritos? The popcorn?

1013
00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:48.125
[Richard]
And I had my very own focus group.

1014
00:50:48.208 --> 00:50:49.750
-Uh. Doritos.
-Oh. yeah.

1015
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.333
[chip crunches]

1016
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.417
[chewing]

1017
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.458
[gasps. stammering] Hot! [pants]

1018
00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:58.583
Hot like elote hot? Good hot?

1019
00:50:58.667 --> 00:51:00.708
-No! Bad. bad. bad.
-Come on.

1020
00:51:00.792 --> 00:51:02.542
-[groans. indistinct]
-[chips crunch]

1021
00:51:03.042 --> 00:51:04.042
-[coughs]
-[heaves]

1022
00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:05.125
-Oh. my-- Baby.
-Hot.

1023
00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:06.042
Oh. water!

1024
00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:09.125
[Richard] Chale . man.
That salsa would've made the devil sweat.

1025
00:51:09.625 --> 00:51:11.083
While we were trying to remember

1026
00:51:11.167 --> 00:51:15.500
everything our abuelitas taught us
about chile . apparently. in the Midwest.

1027
00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:18.083
they had already been spicing things up
for a while.

1028
00:51:18.167 --> 00:51:21.708
Except their ingredients came
in test tubes and syringes.

1029
00:51:21.792 --> 00:51:22.833
[pants] Oh. it's hot.

1030
00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:25.000
-[alarm blaring]
-Hot. Hot. Hot!

1031
00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:27.250
[Richard]
I don't know what's going down over there.

1032
00:51:27.333 --> 00:51:31.417
All I knew was. our ingredients came
from the ground. Our roots.

1033
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:33.625
Maltodextrin.

1034
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.500
Monosodium glutamate.

1035
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.917
Disodium inosinate.

1036
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
[Richard] Me and Judy had
that spice in our DNA.

1037
00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:46.375
[Judy] You gotta turn the bowl.

1038
00:51:46.458 --> 00:51:47.708
-Look. taste this.
-[grunts]

1039
00:51:47.792 --> 00:51:49.125
There you go. How is it?

1040
00:51:49.917 --> 00:51:50.917
-It's wet.
-Wet?

1041
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.333
I think we need to bake 'em.
I think they need to be dry ingredients.

1042
00:51:53.417 --> 00:51:54.750
Wait. no. no. no. Try it.

1043
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:57.000
-Ah. chile de pasilla.
-[Richard] Mmm.

1044
00:51:57.083 --> 00:51:59.125
Dad. just shake it. It's not sticking.

1045
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:02.125
It's gotta tumble.
like it does in the factory.

1046
00:52:07.667 --> 00:52:12.125
If anyone was gonna crack this recipe.
it was gonna be us: the Montañez.

1047
00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:16.875
We had tried every chile
in every store in town.

1048
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:20.250
Until finally…

1049
00:52:27.417 --> 00:52:28.625
[crunching]

1050
00:52:31.042 --> 00:52:32.708
[gasps] Ow! Ow! Ow! It burns!

1051
00:52:32.792 --> 00:52:34.292
[both] Burns good or burns bad?

1052
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:37.417
It burns good.

1053
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.750
-Oh!
-[screams]

1054
00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:39.833
Oh. we did it!

1055
00:52:39.917 --> 00:52:41.167
-Oh. Yeah!
-[Judy laughs]

1056
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.500
Of course we did!

1057
00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:46.250
[factory workers chattering. clamoring]

1058
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:51.083
[supervisor] I'm just doing
what corporate tells me to do.

1059
00:52:51.583 --> 00:52:52.583
What happened?

1060
00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:56.250
-Layoffs. son. Lots of 'em.
-[supervisor] I'm the messenger here.

1061
00:52:58.333 --> 00:53:00.000
Where's Tony? Where's Nacho?

1062
00:53:00.083 --> 00:53:01.792
[clamoring continues]

1063
00:53:01.875 --> 00:53:04.125
[supervisor] Do you really think
I wanna lay people off?

1064
00:53:04.208 --> 00:53:07.583
Okay. Hey. hey. hey! That's it!
That's all I got for now. okay?

1065
00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:08.875
Back to work.

1066
00:53:08.958 --> 00:53:11.042
-Hey. Lonny!
-[Lonny] Somebody put this ladder back.

1067
00:53:11.125 --> 00:53:13.500
Lonny. hold up. man.
Hey. look. You gotta listen to me.

1068
00:53:13.583 --> 00:53:16.417
I got an idea.
An idea you gotta tell Enrico about.

1069
00:53:17.042 --> 00:53:19.500
It's a new line of products.
It's a spicy chip!

1070
00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:22.958
It's gonna change everything.
Spicy Doritos. Fritos. Cheetos.

1071
00:53:23.042 --> 00:53:24.042
Spicy what?

1072
00:53:24.125 --> 00:53:26.708
[stammers] I just laid off
a slew of hardworking guys again.

1073
00:53:26.792 --> 00:53:28.083
-Yeah--
-A lot of 'em your friends.

1074
00:53:28.167 --> 00:53:30.000
and you wanna tell me
about some new flavor you got?

1075
00:53:30.083 --> 00:53:31.333
Look. if you just called Enrico…

1076
00:53:31.417 --> 00:53:33.167
Oh. you just want me to call Enrico?

1077
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.083
-Yeah.
-And just tell him.

1078
00:53:35.167 --> 00:53:39.208
"Oh. our janitor. the guy who cleans
the toilets. he's got a bright idea"?

1079
00:53:39.292 --> 00:53:41.417
You know I can do more
than clean the toilets. Lonny.

1080
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.000
It ain't like that. okay?

1081
00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:46.792
New products take years to develop.
cost millions to launch.

1082
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:50.083
and they do not get created
by blue-collar hoodlums.

1083
00:53:50.167 --> 00:53:53.083
who probably can't spell
the word "hoodlum."

1084
00:53:54.583 --> 00:53:56.542
Hey! What's with the chitchat?

1085
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.583
[Richard] When I was seven.

1086
00:54:05.667 --> 00:54:09.000
these white ladies would come
to our school to tutor us in reading.

1087
00:54:09.792 --> 00:54:12.417
Except there were two trailers.
One for the white kids…

1088
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:16.417
and one for everybody else.
the brown kids.

1089
00:54:17.042 --> 00:54:20.083
Because. you know.
they liked to keep us separate.

1090
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.625
And then.
kids that came out of the white trailer.

1091
00:54:23.708 --> 00:54:26.042
they always came out
with cookies in their hands.

1092
00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:27.125
[drawer opens]

1093
00:54:27.792 --> 00:54:31.125
And I really wanted one of those cookies.

1094
00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:35.125
And one day. I got in that line.

1095
00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:41.250
The white kids spit at me. shoved me.

1096
00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:43.167
and told me. "Go back to Mexico!"

1097
00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:47.958
But I didn't care. I stayed in that line.

1098
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.875
I went into that trailer.

1099
00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:54.667
[drawer closes]

1100
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:58.833
And when I came out.
I came out with my damn cookies.

1101
00:55:05.667 --> 00:55:08.333
[factory workers chattering]

1102
00:55:20.625 --> 00:55:21.625
[phone rings]

1103
00:55:24.417 --> 00:55:25.917
[phone rings]

1104
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.625
Office of President Roger Enrico.

1105
00:55:27.708 --> 00:55:29.333
Uh. hi.

1106
00:55:29.417 --> 00:55:32.458
Uh. may I speak with Roger Enrico. please?
This is Richard Montañez.

1107
00:55:32.542 --> 00:55:35.125
Uh. what country are you calling from.
Mr. Montañez?

1108
00:55:35.708 --> 00:55:36.875
United States.

1109
00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:42.167
[inhales sharply] Well. you're not
the president of American corporate.

1110
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.375
'cause that's not his name.

1111
00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:44.833
I work in California.

1112
00:55:44.917 --> 00:55:46.875
Don't say anything. This says "received."

1113
00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:48.833
Oh. you're the VP of California.

1114
00:55:48.917 --> 00:55:49.917
[Richard] No. I. um…

1115
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.458
-You. Let's go.
-I work at the Rancho Cucamonga plant.

1116
00:55:52.542 --> 00:55:54.542
Okay. so you're the plant director?

1117
00:55:54.625 --> 00:55:57.750
Not exactly.
I work "inside" inside the plant.

1118
00:55:57.833 --> 00:55:58.833
I'm. uh…

1119
00:56:01.042 --> 00:56:02.458
I'm a maintenance technician.

1120
00:56:05.542 --> 00:56:06.667
Hello?

1121
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.375
Um. the janitor? You're the janitor?

1122
00:56:09.458 --> 00:56:11.000
Okay. no. no. don't-don't-don't hang up.

1123
00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:13.083
I have an idea that's gonna
revolutionize Frito-Lay.

1124
00:56:13.167 --> 00:56:15.042
That'll save our factory.
that'll save jobs.

1125
00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:17.583
that'll save hardworking people
who are just trying to survive.

1126
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:21.333
Look. if he cares about his people.
his people on the line.

1127
00:56:21.417 --> 00:56:22.917
Mr. Enrico needs to hear this.

1128
00:56:23.625 --> 00:56:28.083
[chattering]

1129
00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:34.625
Please hold.

1130
00:56:34.708 --> 00:56:35.708
[beeps]

1131
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:44.542
Hello. Richard. This is Roger.

1132
00:56:44.625 --> 00:56:46.542
Mr. Enrico. uh--

1133
00:56:48.708 --> 00:56:50.292
Thank you for taking my call.

1134
00:56:50.375 --> 00:56:52.042
I have an idea that you need to hear.

1135
00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:54.042
I'm listening.

1136
00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:55.792
[Richard] Okay. yes. sir.

1137
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:59.833
I'm Mexican and proud of it.
And there's a lot of us in this country.

1138
00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:02.583
and we spend money on snacks
just like everybody else.

1139
00:57:03.125 --> 00:57:06.625
We eat Doritos. but not before
covering them suckers with Tapatio.

1140
00:57:06.708 --> 00:57:09.625
It's like the more it burns.
the more money we'll spend on it.

1141
00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:12.333
So I thought.
"Why don't I make my own spicy slurry?"

1142
00:57:12.417 --> 00:57:15.792
You made your own spicy slurry?

1143
00:57:15.875 --> 00:57:17.333
[Richard] Yeah. I did. And it's good.

1144
00:57:17.417 --> 00:57:21.708
You can slather it on everything:
Doritos. Fritos. popcorn. Cheetos.

1145
00:57:21.792 --> 00:57:24.875
And the best part. sir.
it is 100% Mexican-approved.

1146
00:57:24.958 --> 00:57:28.000
Uh. my family. my neighbors.
they can't get enough.

1147
00:57:28.083 --> 00:57:32.000
And I got a plan. Mr. Enrico. to get it
to the streets. to get it to my people.

1148
00:57:32.083 --> 00:57:36.292
I think it will save our factory.
It will save jobs.

1149
00:57:36.875 --> 00:57:38.000
Save jobs. huh?

1150
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:42.542
That's a lot of confidence there. Richard.

1151
00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:49.167
Yes. sir. And you said in the video.
"Think like a CEO." So I did. [chuckles]

1152
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.250
You saw my video?

1153
00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:56.333
[Richard] Yes. sir.

1154
00:57:56.417 --> 00:57:58.417
And you're a janitor?

1155
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.875
Maintenance crew. sir.

1156
00:57:59.958 --> 00:58:02.875
Look. if it's okay.
I'd like to send you some samples. sir.

1157
00:58:04.292 --> 00:58:07.542
Richard. that's more than okay with me.

1158
00:58:07.625 --> 00:58:09.000
- More than okay.
-[grunts]

1159
00:58:09.875 --> 00:58:10.875
Thank you. sir.

1160
00:58:11.708 --> 00:58:12.792
[line clicks]

1161
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:15.458
[sighs]

1162
00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:18.042
-[clerk] Next.
-Go. go.

1163
00:58:21.292 --> 00:58:23.917
What are we doing. guys?
First class? Priority?

1164
00:58:24.708 --> 00:58:25.708
Hold on a sec.

1165
00:58:31.167 --> 00:58:32.167
We should pray.

1166
00:58:33.125 --> 00:58:34.875
-We should?
-Yeah.

1167
00:58:34.958 --> 00:58:38.792
I mean. God got us here. right?
We should let God take it home.

1168
00:58:39.833 --> 00:58:40.875
Yeah. Yeah.

1169
00:58:40.958 --> 00:58:42.958
[breathes deeply]

1170
00:58:44.625 --> 00:58:47.792
Uh. dear God. Jesus. señor…

1171
00:58:48.875 --> 00:58:50.417
-I mean. you know who you are.
-[chuckles]

1172
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:55.375
Listen. man. We both know I've--
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.

1173
00:58:55.458 --> 00:58:59.958
Mmm. the gang. the guns. the drugs.
the stolen cars. the other drugs.

1174
00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:01.708
Man. there was a lot of drugs.

1175
00:59:01.792 --> 00:59:06.083
You know.
maybe I wasn't never bad. just lost.

1176
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.542
But I'm doing good things now. so--

1177
00:59:08.625 --> 00:59:10.500
What the heck. man? Let's move it.

1178
00:59:10.583 --> 00:59:13.375
Hey! He is praying. pendejo!
Have some respect.

1179
00:59:15.167 --> 00:59:16.292
Go ahead. baby.

1180
00:59:16.958 --> 00:59:21.167
Lord. please forgive me
for all my past sins. and…

1181
00:59:23.417 --> 00:59:25.458
pour all your blessings
onto this box right here.

1182
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:28.875
A-Amen?

1183
00:59:28.958 --> 00:59:30.375
Amen.

1184
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:33.917
Amen.

1185
00:59:35.792 --> 00:59:36.792
Amen.

1186
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:42.375
[Patti] Here you go. sir.

1187
00:59:45.625 --> 00:59:49.417
[Richard] That Italian jefe
was about to have his mind blown.

1188
00:59:58.542 --> 00:59:59.542
Holy!

1189
01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:01.667
Hot! That's h--

1190
01:00:02.292 --> 01:00:03.292
Mama hot!

1191
01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:05.958
Patti!

1192
01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:09.167
Water. [coughs]

1193
01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:13.583
[blows]

1194
01:00:18.625 --> 01:00:19.625
[exhales sharply]

1195
01:00:21.126 --> 01:00:22.583
[phone ringing]

1196
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:28.833
Maintenance. Richard.

1197
01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.500
Richard. it's Roger.

1198
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:32.875
Roger Enrico.

1199
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.375
- Are you there?
-Yes. sir.

1200
01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:39.583
Listen. Richard. I can't stop thinking
about your initiative.

1201
01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:42.875
And I'm coming to Rancho Cucamonga
for a plant tour.

1202
01:00:42.958 --> 01:00:45.000
What do you say I meet you there.

1203
01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:48.333
and you tell me more about your ideas?

1204
01:00:48.417 --> 01:00:50.000
In about two weeks.

1205
01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:52.458
- Would that be okay with you?
-Yes. sir. More than okay.

1206
01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:54.417
Good. We'll be in touch.

1207
01:00:56.917 --> 01:01:00.625
Who the hell is this Richard Montañez?

1208
01:01:00.708 --> 01:01:03.333
And who let him call
Roger-freaking-Enrico?

1209
01:01:03.417 --> 01:01:04.667
Get him on the phone!

1210
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.250
Okay. I don't know who that is!

1211
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.083
What do you mean you don't know the guy?

1212
01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:10.292
He works in your plant. Find him!

1213
01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:12.833
Montañez?

1214
01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:14.958
Montañez!

1215
01:01:15.542 --> 01:01:17.875
-[bangs]
-Stay right there!

1216
01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.292
-[Richard] Turns out. I messed up.
-[Lonny] Are you kidding me?

1217
01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:22.917
I broke rank and went straight to the top.

1218
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.833
Wasn't nobody happy with this chavalo
talking to the top dog.

1219
01:01:25.917 --> 01:01:28.375
-Lonny. it ain't even like that.
-Oh. you're gonna paint.

1220
01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:30.333
You're gonna fix every machine in here.

1221
01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:32.000
You're gonna clean every particle of dust

1222
01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.583
until every code violation
in here is gone.

1223
01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:35.667
Good luck with that!

1224
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.417
Mr. Enrico's coming to hear
about my product.

1225
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.833
Yeah. and when he's done listening
and realizes it's all nonsense.

1226
01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:43.167
he's gonna think. "Hey. I don't need you."

1227
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.750
Then he's gonna realize we need
to stop hemorrhaging money.

1228
01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:48.500
and he's gonna start by shutting us down!

1229
01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:52.083
You better pray for a miracle. Montañez.

1230
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:56.375
Because before this is over.
one way or another. you won't have a job.

1231
01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:57.625
-[smacks lips]
-No!

1232
01:01:57.708 --> 01:02:00.667
None of us will have a job!
Thanks to Richard!

1233
01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:02.583
Thanks. Richard.

1234
01:02:06.917 --> 01:02:08.167
[workers muttering]

1235
01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:11.917
Mm-mmm.

1236
01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:25.042
Baby?

1237
01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.500
What are you doing up?

1238
01:02:28.542 --> 01:02:31.042
I got to find a way to stop Enrico
from coming.

1239
01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.083
-Stop him?
-Mm-hmm.

1240
01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:35.750
Uh-uh. No. what--

1241
01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:37.458
-What are you doing?
-[Richard grunts]

1242
01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:39.875
Uh-uh. Come on. Get up. Get up. Come on!

1243
01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:42.750
Look at yourself.

1244
01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:44.917
-[Richard sighs]
-Look. You see that guy right there?

1245
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.750
Who? That guapo right there?
Yeah. I see him.

1246
01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:48.458
Yeah. you do? You see a good man?

1247
01:02:48.542 --> 01:02:49.833
-Come on. [sighs]
-A special man?

1248
01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.000
Because. baby. that's what I see.

1249
01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:54.083
I see a chingón.

1250
01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:55.667
A Montañez.

1251
01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:58.167
[speaking Spanish]

1252
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.625
[speaking Spanish]

1253
01:02:59.708 --> 01:03:00.958
[Judy. in English] They're scared.

1254
01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:03.125
Scared of what you can do for them.

1255
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.917
Scared that they've been begging for help.

1256
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.250
and they got a broke Mexican kid
from Guasti as their hero.

1257
01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.542
They don't know what to do with that.

1258
01:03:14.292 --> 01:03:16.792
Baby. do you know what I've
been praying for all these years?

1259
01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:21.333
That you would see the gifts
and talents that you have.

1260
01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.875
Baby. use your gifts.

1261
01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.542
Be great!

1262
01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:29.583
Enrico is coming to hear you speak.

1263
01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:33.083
Do not let these sinvergüenzas stop you.

1264
01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:35.792
I-- [sighs]

1265
01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:39.542
I-I don't even know
how to do a sales presentation.

1266
01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:41.917
Well. guess what?

1267
01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:43.500
We're gonna find out.

1268
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.917
Now. come on. Let's go to bed.

1269
01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.500
[Richard]
You wanna survive this crazy world?

1270
01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:49.708
Get yourself a Judy.

1271
01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:54.292
Man. she took me to biz church
the next few weeks.

1272
01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:55.875
-Okay. that's enough.
-That's really smart.

1273
01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.750
-Babe. no.
-Ooh. baby. The Hispanic Market.

1274
01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.958
-That's good.
-[Judy] Great book.

1275
01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:01.750
This is great. I had no idea
any of this stuff was a-- a thing.

1276
01:04:01.833 --> 01:04:03.417
You don't know how
to use a computer. right?

1277
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.417
-So this is all the information online…
-Oh. yeah.

1278
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.000
I should learn how to use a computer.

1279
01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.208
[Judy grunts]

1280
01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.125
"Present a solution to their challenges."

1281
01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.167
Connect prospects to profits.

1282
01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.125
What's "prospects"?

1283
01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:15.458
[Steven] Got it!

1284
01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:17.417
[Judy] No. baby.
you have to be. like. animated.

1285
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.500
What. like Bugs Bunny?

1286
01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:21.167
-No. like. excited. big. you know?
-[sighs]

1287
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:25.125
"The Hispanics are the fastest growing
segment in the US population."

1288
01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:28.000
See. that's what I've been saying. baby.
We like to get down!

1289
01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:29.750
Okay. baby. Come on. Reel it in.

1290
01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:32.000
I need to say something like.
"We're being ignored."

1291
01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:35.667
Then say that. but from your diaphragm
and your chest. head up.

1292
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.000
Take control of the room.

1293
01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:41.250
Say. "The Hispanic market
will not be ignored."

1294
01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:45.417
[imitating Clarence]
The Hispanic market will not be ignored.

1295
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.083
Good. but in your voice.

1296
01:04:57.542 --> 01:05:00.708
-Baby. I found Versace for $3.
-Yeah?

1297
01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:04.708
-Oh. no. it's Vermachee.
-[grunts]

1298
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.375
[speaking Spanish]

1299
01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.000
-[in English] You look so good.
-[Richard] Yeah?

1300
01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:13.417
-I feel weird. [sighs]
-No. you look good.

1301
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.500
You look sharp.

1302
01:05:15.292 --> 01:05:17.083
This looks really good on you.

1303
01:05:18.167 --> 01:05:19.167
[chuckles]

1304
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.458
Something like this.

1305
01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:22.958
You're the best person I know.

1306
01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:26.417
Who. me? [clicks tongue]

1307
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.750
I'm just a poor cholita
who got smart about God.

1308
01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:32.042
Nah. pretty sure God got smart about you.

1309
01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:34.292
[scoffs]

1310
01:05:34.917 --> 01:05:36.125
Silly.

1311
01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.292
Jude. I--

1312
01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:41.750
I'm here because of you.

1313
01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:43.875
You know that. right?

1314
01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:46.708
What? [scoffs]

1315
01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:48.833
There's no me without you.

1316
01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:50.875
[chuckles]

1317
01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:55.000
Thank you for believing in me. mi reina.

1318
01:05:55.667 --> 01:05:57.167
[chuckles]

1319
01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:03.375
[clicks tongue] Well. your reina
don't know jack about tying a tie.

1320
01:06:06.292 --> 01:06:08.250
B-But I know someone who does.

1321
01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:13.208
-[clicks tongue] Nah. man. No way--
-Baby. I know.

1322
01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:14.500
I know. I know.

1323
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.792
But he won't stop calling.
I don't think he's gonna go away.

1324
01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.042
He does love you.

1325
01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:26.833
You look good.

1326
01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:29.792
I'm gonna go find some fake Gucci.

1327
01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:36.208
[Richard] When you've had as many
court dates as Vacho.

1328
01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:37.583
you master tying a tie.

1329
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:44.625
-I know I don't got the right to tell you.
-Come on. man.

1330
01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.750
-[sighs]
-[Vacho] Listen to me.

1331
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.833
[speaking Spanish]

1332
01:06:54.583 --> 01:06:56.708
[in English] I am so proud of you. mijo.

1333
01:06:58.167 --> 01:07:03.667
And I'll always regret not being the man
that made you the man you are today.

1334
01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:07.333
Always.

1335
01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:10.958
[breathing shakily]

1336
01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:18.542
[chuckles. sniffles]

1337
01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.625
[in English] You look good. mijo.

1338
01:07:29.917 --> 01:07:30.917
[sighs]

1339
01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:04.833
[Richard] There are more Hispanics
in the United States than there are…

1340
01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:08.417
There are more Hispanics
in the United States

1341
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.292
than there are in-- [gasps]

1342
01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:11.583
Come on out. It's time.

1343
01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:13.917
Okay.

1344
01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.750
[Lonny] And I've organized a checklist
that we call "quality control" or "QC."

1345
01:08:19.833 --> 01:08:22.375
You can say "Quality C" too.
Actually. either way.

1346
01:08:22.458 --> 01:08:25.333
And those quality checks
every 20 minutes are the reason

1347
01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:27.333
we haven't had a line go down in years.

1348
01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:28.500
Unlike Bakersfield.

1349
01:08:28.583 --> 01:08:30.292
-Right. I see.
-If you don't mind.

1350
01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.292
I'd love to show you
how the colettes are made.

1351
01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:35.417
Mr. Mason. I happen to know
how colettes are made.

1352
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.125
My time is limited. so I--

1353
01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:39.000
Where is Richard?
I'd like to speak to him.

1354
01:08:39.083 --> 01:08:40.708
Sure. sure. Uh. Richard!

1355
01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:41.792
[Richard] I'm here!

1356
01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:50.167
[no audible dialogue]

1357
01:08:53.208 --> 01:08:56.208
[Clarence. mouthing words]

1358
01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:02.375
The infamous Richard Montañez.

1359
01:09:02.458 --> 01:09:04.375
What an honor to meet you. Richard.

1360
01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:05.625
Are you ready?

1361
01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.917
A huevo. I've been ready.

1362
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.125
[Roger chuckles] All right.

1363
01:09:09.208 --> 01:09:12.375
[Richard] All right. all right.
Judy says I exaggerate this part a lot.

1364
01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.417
I guess it was
a little bit more like this.

1365
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.375
I'm here! Here!

1366
01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:18.625
-Pardon me.
-[worker] Watch out.

1367
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.333
-That's my foot!
-Sorry. Excuse me. guys.

1368
01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:22.458
Just need to get right there.
Thank you so much.

1369
01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:28.875
[sighs]

1370
01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:30.917
So nice to meet you.

1371
01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:34.250
Are you ready. Richard?

1372
01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:36.333
-Yes. sir.
-Let's do it.

1373
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.583
[sighs]

1374
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.000
Anytime you're ready. Richard.

1375
01:09:51.458 --> 01:09:52.625
[sighs]

1376
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:58.167
"The growing number of Latinos in America

1377
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:01.917
represents a vast untapped market
for Frito-Lay."

1378
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
[person coughs]

1379
01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:10.000
"Did you know that there are more Latinos
in the United States than in Australia?"

1380
01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:11.583
Of course there are.

1381
01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:15.583
No. um. [chuckles]

1382
01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:17.333
Nah. that's not-- I meant that. um--

1383
01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:19.833
Did you know that there are more Latinos
in the United States

1384
01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:21.833
than there are Australians in Australia?

1385
01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:24.458
[executive] Mmm. All right. I see.

1386
01:10:26.125 --> 01:10:28.792
Pretty sure there's more Mexicans
in this room than in Australia.

1387
01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:30.375
[laughing]

1388
01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.792
Clarence. can you get the light. please?

1389
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.500
[sighs]

1390
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.583
Listen. gentlemen. no offense…

1391
01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:50.917
but our shelves are boring.

1392
01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:55.708
People. my people.
they're tired of the same old flavors.

1393
01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:58.500
See. I grew up with a lot of flavors.

1394
01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:01.958
and I've been searching for that taste
in everything I buy ever since.

1395
01:11:02.042 --> 01:11:04.083
I want a food that tastes like home.

1396
01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:07.583
[bag rustling]

1397
01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:09.417
This is it.

1398
01:11:09.917 --> 01:11:11.958
Everything I grew up with. in a bag.

1399
01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:13.500
Chile chips.

1400
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.625
And if you put this out there.
you'll see that there's this whole market

1401
01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.292
that no one else is paying attention to.

1402
01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:22.000
Us. la gente.

1403
01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:26.583
And what about market share?
How much would your. uh. "product" yield?

1404
01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:29.083
-According to you.
-Um…

1405
01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:31.167
[thinking] What the F is market share?

1406
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.542
That wasn't in the books.

1407
01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:34.625
Or maybe it was. It was a lot of books.

1408
01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:35.708
Um…

1409
01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:48.208
This much.

1410
01:11:48.292 --> 01:11:50.250
This much market share.

1411
01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:51.833
[executives laughing]

1412
01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:58.333
You know what?

1413
01:11:58.417 --> 01:11:59.917
I don't know what market share is

1414
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.958
because I don't sit up
in no corporate office wearing a suit.

1415
01:12:03.792 --> 01:12:06.000
Like. I'm down here with mi gente.

1416
01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:08.125
and here's what I know about 'em.

1417
01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:10.500
They're looking for themselves
on those shelves.

1418
01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:14.625
They wanna know that the food
that they eat at home is valued by you.

1419
01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:16.208
That we matter.

1420
01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:19.458
I wanna know that I matter
when I pick up one of our products.

1421
01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:23.375
To you. to this company. to the world.

1422
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.958
So put this chili slurry on Doritos.
Fritos. popcorn. anything.

1423
01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:31.875
Because. at the end of the day.
it's how we make them feel.

1424
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:34.958
If we knew that there was
a product out there for us.

1425
01:12:35.042 --> 01:12:37.250
we'd say. "Take all our money. cabrones."

1426
01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:40.542
[executives murmuring]

1427
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:47.792
Oof. I got a little hood there
at the end. but…

1428
01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.083
Gentlemen… [sighs]

1429
01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:56.750
…did you know we could get
this much more market share?

1430
01:12:58.042 --> 01:12:59.667
-Did you?
-[chuckling]

1431
01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:02.042
Thank you. Richard.

1432
01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:06.167
You have given us
a lot to think about here.

1433
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.167
Uh. sir. I got--

1434
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.708
I got some more graphs and stuff
that I can show you.

1435
01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:16.333
Sir. R & D already has
a spicy product in the Midwest.

1436
01:13:16.417 --> 01:13:18.042
and it's testing just fine.

1437
01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:22.042
Just fine? I aim to do better
than "just fine." James.

1438
01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:25.000
Have McCormick send
the spicy seasonings here.

1439
01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:27.083
I have a good feeling about this man.

1440
01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:29.042
He may not know about market trends.

1441
01:13:29.125 --> 01:13:33.083
but he knows about people.
and that's where I always put my money.

1442
01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:34.458
Let's see what he can do with it.

1443
01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:36.875
Sir. the resources required for it
to pivot so quickly--

1444
01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:38.708
James.
looks like you have some work to do.

1445
01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:40.625
[Lonny] Do we wanna finish the tour?

1446
01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:42.208
-[Judy] He's here. baby! Go!
-[Richard shouts]

1447
01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.250
-[Lucky] Dad!
-[Richard grunts] Hey!

1448
01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:45.667
-[Judy] How was it?
-[Richard] Great.

1449
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:48.417
-[Lucky] Did you tell them about me?
-[Richard] Of course I told them.

1450
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.167
Enrico wanted to test the market
with 5.000 cases.

1451
01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:55.500
[Richard] The next few months were a blur.

1452
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.083
I did it. man. I got my shot.

1453
01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:02.667
Well. it's not Judy's. but it will do.

1454
01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:07.500
First one off the line.

1455
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:14.292
You did good.

1456
01:14:15.042 --> 01:14:18.917
[Richard] I was the guy with initiative.
and this was my magnum opus.

1457
01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:21.250
Judy taught me that phrase.

1458
01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:40.917
[James] As I suspected. the product
isn't selling. so we're pulling it.

1459
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.708
They haven't been
on the market long enough.

1460
01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:45.167
Mr. Montañez. product's not moving.

1461
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:46.375
Simple as that.

1462
01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.208
Mr. Finley. I was just wondering.
how many cases have we moved so far?

1463
01:14:50.292 --> 01:14:52.375
[James] I don't have that information
in front of me.

1464
01:14:52.458 --> 01:14:55.833
But we can't continue to invest
in Richard's strategies at this rate.

1465
01:14:55.917 --> 01:14:57.458
What strategies?

1466
01:14:57.542 --> 01:14:59.375
You haven't even let me do anything!

1467
01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:01.833
Like. are you even targeting
all the Latino cities?

1468
01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:04.000
We're everywhere! Pacoima. Montebello.

1469
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.042
Of course. Mr. Montañez.

1470
01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:08.917
And no one in your market
is responding to it.

1471
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.250
[Lonny] Uh. sir. Mr. Finley. could--
could we just get one more week?

1472
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:15.125
I mean. that-that-that's all we're asking.

1473
01:15:16.375 --> 01:15:18.375
[Clarence] Hey! What is it? What happened?

1474
01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:20.500
[Richard] They're not moving the product.

1475
01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:23.667
They're killing it.
They're gonna shut us down.

1476
01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:25.667
Like. who'd I think I was?

1477
01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:27.917
I'm a nobody.

1478
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.333
Pretending like
I could do something was stupid.

1479
01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:31.417
Oh. wait a minute.

1480
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.625
You find out
that the product's not moving.

1481
01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:37.042
so you decide that you're an idiot
and can't do nothin'?

1482
01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:38.250
[Richard scoffs]

1483
01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.875
[Clarence] Figure out the next step.

1484
01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.667
Yeah. what next step?

1485
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.625
There's no next step for guys like us.

1486
01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:46.333
If there was a next step. you would've had
Lonny's job a long time ago.

1487
01:15:47.625 --> 01:15:48.792
All right. all right.

1488
01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:49.875
You ain't wrong.

1489
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.958
But did I let that stop me
from being the best damn worker here?

1490
01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.042
Did this place stop you

1491
01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:59.417
from having the balls to pick up the phone
and call Roger Enrico?

1492
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.667
Yeah. but then I embarrassed myself.

1493
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:03.875
Embarrassment's never stopped you before.

1494
01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:07.625
Ask questions.
You wore my ass out with 'em.

1495
01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:12.833
Look here. the person
I met ten years ago wouldn't blink.

1496
01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:14.875
He'd find a way. any way. to get it done.

1497
01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:17.625
I don't wanna look you up
in 20 years from now

1498
01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:19.917
just to find out you're still down here
on the bottom.

1499
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Step up!

1500
01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:30.625
Baby. can't you just call Enrico?

1501
01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.917
Calling Enrico is what got me
in this mess in the first place.

1502
01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.792
Clarence is right.

1503
01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:40.417
I gotta figure this out.

1504
01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:43.792
[Richard sighs]

1505
01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:53.750
-[Steven] Apá.
-[Judy] What's wrong. baby?

1506
01:16:53.833 --> 01:16:55.083
[Lucky] He got scared.

1507
01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:57.792
Oh. you don't need to be scared.

1508
01:16:57.875 --> 01:16:59.417
The power just went out.

1509
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.667
Plus. your dad's gonna take care
of everything.

1510
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.625
I think I know why it's not selling.

1511
01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:05.458
-What do you mean?
-[Lucky] The Cheetos.

1512

Nah. I'm just playin'.
It didn't go down like that.

1683

You think these fools had that in them?
Chale.

1684
01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:11.833
Here's the latest sales report
on Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

1685
01:24:13.875 --> 01:24:16.333
Whoa. Finley.
How much money did you put into this?

1686
01:24:17.167 --> 01:24:19.875
-Why?
-Because Southern California's blowing up.

1687
01:24:20.708 --> 01:24:23.208
Hmm. That-- That's a blip.

Look. uh. sir.

1689
01:24:27.792 --> 01:24:30.000
on this janitor's crazy ideas?

1690
01:24:30.083 --> 01:24:33.750
You still think
I'm investing in a janitor?

1691
01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:36.458
Finley. come on.

1692
01:24:37.042 --> 01:24:38.292

-Oh!
-Yeah!

1725

Hey. Montañez.
I need you to head up to room C on six.

Ah. hello. Richard.

1739
01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:04.083
Mr. Enrico. what are you--
What are you doing here?

1740
01:28:04.167 --> 01:28:09.375
Ah. I was in town for a convention.
where I told them about your story.

1741
01:28:10.167 --> 01:28:11.292
They loved it.

1742
01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:13.292
-Course. I told the shit out of it…
-[chuckles]

1743
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:17.667
…'cause it's a story
I know very well. Richard.

1744
01:28:18.458 --> 01:28:23.000
You know. I ran around the mines
of small-town Chisholm. Minnesota

1745
01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:26.375
when I was a snot-nosed Italian kid.

1746
01:28:26.458 --> 01:28:31.750
who had dreams bigger than
what that place could contain.

1747
01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:34.833
The thing is. Richard.

1748
01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:38.667
visionaries can't be contained.

1749
01:28:39.792 --> 01:28:42.583
And a smart person
doesn't try to contain them.

1750
01:28:43.083 --> 01:28:48.083
In fact. smarter guys.
like us. invest in vision.

1751
01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:51.250
So I'm thinking it's a good idea…
