3
00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:27.211
This is good news for all of us
because the international relations

4
00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:29.628
between Australia and the Philippines
shall be further strengthened.

5
00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:32.290
We learned that an archeological artifact
found in Australia shall be returned to us.

6
00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:34.317
- Hey. bestie.
- Hey besties. what's up?

7
00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:36.319
- You're finally here.
- Bestie. let's meet up later?

8
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:37.946
Where?

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.576
It is a traditional headhunter ax.
or an ax used in hunting...

10
00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.371
- The usual place.
- What time?

11
00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.707
this ax dates back
its creation to the 1900's.

12
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.284
It was stolen from the Philippines
and sold illegally.

13
00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.813
A few years later...

14
00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:55.839
After end of shift. 4:00 p.m.

15
00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.382
Interpol tracked down
the location of the artifact

16
00:00:57.382 --> 00:00:58.716
and in cooperation
with the Australian government.

17
00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.468
Please. I'm sick of taking calls.

18
00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:05.589
the suspects were caught and the
so-called headhunter ax was recovered.

19
00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:10.103
- Alright. See you.
- Yay! See you Rach.

20
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:14.441
as Filipinos. we should treasure
and appreciate not only the present

21
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.609
but also our past and beginnings.

22
00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.320
- Jesus. why do you keep following us?
- Sir… Ma'am…

23
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.239
- We told you. we didn't break that!
- It was that way when we saw it.

24
00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:25.535
- No. sir. That's not true.
- You're such a pest.

25
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.704
We're your regular customers.
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:29.581
You can't make me pay
for something you broke.

27
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.166
I don't care what you say--

28
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.834
But it wasn't us.
Why do you keep blaming us?

29
00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.502
We didn't break it.
That's how we saw it.

30
00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:35.687
It was already broken.

31
00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.423
- Ma'am. please don't do this.
- We don't care.

32
00:01:38.457 --> 00:01:41.159
Ma'am. sir! You have to pay for this!

33
00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.621
You broke it!

34
00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.668
Ma'am. sir! Please wait!

35
00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:46.681
It's snapped. look.

36
00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:47.874
Are you messing with me?

37
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:49.566
I told you. it was already like that!

38
00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:52.829
But sir. it was your wife
who held this last.

39
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:55.356
You liar! I didn't break that!

40
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:57.321
Ma'am. I am not a liar.

41
00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:58.347
This was a good quality--

42
00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:00.708
Call your manager!
I want to speak to her!

43
00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:01.696
Go!

44
00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:03.406
Wait here. sir.

45
00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:06.201
You don't need to call the manager. babe.

46
00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:08.661
- Was it you who broke it?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:11.231
- You stupid little... how much was it?
- 1800 pesos.

48
00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:14.167
Come on. let's go.

49
00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:18.671
I thought you said
you'll wait for the manager?

50
00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:21.257
Who the hell are you?
Nosy bitch!

51
00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.595
Sir. we welcome all tourists
here with open hearts.

52
00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.014
And what we want in return

53
00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:29.505
is respect.

54
00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:31.543
Who do you think you are?

55
00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:33.728
I'm Rachel.

56
00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:35.855
- So?
- I'm from here.

57
00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:36.539
Okay?

58
00:02:36.564 --> 00:02:39.317
And the way you insulted
the saleslady back there.

59
00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:41.219
speaks of how lowly you think of us.

60
00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:42.644
Let's just go.

61
00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:45.573
Ouch!

62
00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:51.120
Oh my god. miss! Please stop!

63
00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:53.147
The lady had every right to demand you pay!

64
00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:56.376
And can you not be rude to everyone here?

65
00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:58.473
Have some manners!

66
00:02:59.393 --> 00:03:01.523
Just because you're not from here.

67
00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.358
doesn’t mean you can
get away with everything!

68
00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.425
Please. stop fighting.

69
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.965
We understand. miss. We'll pay.

70
00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.681
I'm sorry. We'll pay it.

71
00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:11.432
We're gonna pay for it. Ouch!

72
00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:19.230
They said they'll pay for it.

73
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.072
- This is your fault.
- Thank you. sir.

74
00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.699
We shouldn't have come here. Goddamnit.

75
00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:30.034
Sorry. babe.

76
00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.582
Oh. please. We're the locals.

77
00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.668
I can't believe he had
the gall to be angry! As if!

78
00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:40.753
It was their fault.

79
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.964
I swear. some people--

80
00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.402
Sis. choose your battles.
Take it easy!

81
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:50.629
I know. but I just can't help it.

82
00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:52.365
I'm not generalizing.

83
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.268
but some people are
just downright disrespectful.

84
00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:57.823
Somebody has to look out for our own.

85
00:03:57.848 --> 00:04:00.002
They can't just treat people like that!

86
00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.903
Sis. are you an anthropologist
or an activist?

87
00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:08.616
Sis. it's not about principles.
It's about dignity.

88
00:04:09.157 --> 00:04:10.533
It's about being human.

89
00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.293
Sis. calm down.

90
00:04:13.328 --> 00:04:14.370
I gotta go. Bye.

91
00:04:14.746 --> 00:04:15.788
Okay.

92
00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.165
Who'd you beat up now?

93
00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:19.917
Nobody. uncle. Just some rude tourists.

94
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.544
I swear to god. kid.

95
00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:25.160
Do we have everything
from Mama's list?

96
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:27.091
Yeah! I got everything.

97
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.927
The line was crazy at Sir Inggo's!

98
00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:33.056
- Your mom and her shopping lists.
- You know how she is.

99
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.029
Hi. dear!

100
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.738
Yes. Ma.

101
00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:50.156
Isn't it late for lunch?

102
00:04:51.822 --> 00:04:52.903
How are you?

103
00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.453
I'm good. Let's eat.

104
00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.872
Did you get everything I told you to get?

105
00:04:58.113 --> 00:04:59.154
Yes.

106
00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:04.310
The watermelons and the papaya soap?

107
00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:06.856
You can take a Pinoy
out of the Philippines

108
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.051
but you really can't take
Philippines out of Pinoys. huh?

109
00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.327
What was that?

110
00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.264
Ma. there's a Filipino store
in Melbourne. right?

111
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.558
Too pricey!

112
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.519
Fine. I'll shop here.

113
00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:20.895
But I won't bring much. okay?

114
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:24.148
I don't wanna lug around
all that food and soap.

115
00:05:24.273 --> 00:05:27.777
It's taking forever.
I'm so excited to see you.

116
00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:30.175
Sleep it off over the weekend. Ma.

117
00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.006
I'll be there when you wake up.

118
00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:37.261
I can't wait to see you and hug you!

119
00:05:37.328 --> 00:05:39.914
- You know it's just for two years. right?
- I'm so happy that you finally

120
00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:41.874
decided to leave Baguio.

121
00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:45.253
A lot can happen in
two years. sweetie.

122
00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:48.089
Who knows. you might meet someone here.

123
00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:51.818
Ma. I'm going there
for my Masters!

124
00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:55.680
And please. women aren't built
to just stay home.

125
00:05:55.972 --> 00:05:57.640
have kids. and cook.

126
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.311
I just want you to
have a partner. sweetie!

127
00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:06.441
It's different when you have
someone to come home to.

128
00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:10.445
Ma. I can take care of myself.
Don't worry about me.

129
00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:15.908
I can't wait to have a grandchild
and for you to have a partner!

130
00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:17.201
Marina?

131
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:18.411
Marina!

132
00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:22.373
Here it is! I bought your
favorite Baguio longganisa!

133
00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:23.166
Look!

134
00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:27.003
Say something to your daughter.
She got herself in trouble again!

135
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:27.920
What?!

136
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.921
She's too hard-headed!

137
00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.762
You're at it again!

138
00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:34.218
- See you. Ma. Talk to you later.
- You're just like your father!

139
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.777
Wait out here for a bit. okay?

140
00:06:56.484 --> 00:06:57.612
I won't take long.

141
00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:00.827
Good morning!

142
00:07:00.852 --> 00:07:01.721
Good morning. sir.

143
00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:03.289
Yes. I called earlier.

144
00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:05.832
I was gonna ask about your rates.

145
00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:06.918
Please wait. sir.

146
00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:07.957
Thank you.

147
00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:17.245
Okay!

148
00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:18.832
Great. thanks.

149
00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:22.535
Thanks. sir.

150
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:27.402
Come on. sweetie.

151
00:07:30.024 --> 00:07:31.192
I have a surprise for you.

152
00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:33.402
Really?

153
00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:35.535
I think you'll love it.

154
00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:38.208
You'll have loads of fun.

155
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:42.264
Get in.

156
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:52.588
Not in front of the kid!

157
00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:54.215
Papa!

158
00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.551
Papa! Papa!

159
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.345
Papa!

160
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:14.994
Papa!

161
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.657
This was recovered mid-19th century

162
00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:49.541
and the axe used for wood carving
and hunting made by our Ifugao communities.

163
00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:51.940
The axe. or as they call it. "lingua"

164
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:56.277
reflects the value systems and traditions
passed through generations.

165
00:08:56.527 --> 00:08:59.280
And we are thankful
to the Australian government

166
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.533
for returning it because it was stolen

167
00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:05.036
and it has been returned
to its proper home now.

168
00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:08.122
This speaks for our cultural heritage

169
00:09:08.122 --> 00:09:10.499
between Philippines and Australia.

170
00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:15.796
A heritage that was formed and bonded
by our respective ancestors.

171
00:09:16.213 --> 00:09:17.423
- Thank you. ma'am Rachel.
- Thank you. ma'am Rachel.

172
00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.257
Thank you so much.

173
00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:20.927
If you need anything else.
just message me.

174
00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:23.429
and we can discuss via Zoom.

175
00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.972
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

176
00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:30.603
Oh. by the way. I just wanted to thank you
for doing the interview today.

177
00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:33.397
I really believe you are the right
resource person for doing the interview.

178
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.190
Really appreciate it.

179
00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.400
Thank you. Rome.

180
00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:38.653
By the way.

181
00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:39.946
are you...

182
00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:42.073
are you pushing through
with your trip to Melbourne?

183
00:09:42.073 --> 00:09:42.965
- Yes.
- You're absolutely sure?

184
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.574
Yeah.

185
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.202
Why?

186
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.163
I just hate this feeling. you know?

187
00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:50.373
What feeling?

188
00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:53.251
Of goodbyes.

189
00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:55.753
And it's you who's leaving. so…

190
00:09:56.754 --> 00:10:00.049
Rome. you know it's just
a temporary one. right?

191
00:10:00.364 --> 00:10:02.783
Yeah. but still. I mean--

192
00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:06.610
You do know there's social media. right?

193
00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:08.511
We can talk anytime.

194
00:10:08.705 --> 00:10:13.354
Besides. why don't you pursue
your Guggenheim Fellowship?

195
00:10:15.106 --> 00:10:16.732
Well. honestly.
I'm still thinking about it.

196
00:10:18.359 --> 00:10:19.276
We'll see how it goes.

197
00:10:19.276 --> 00:10:21.278
What's there to think about?

198
00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:24.490
It's a once in
a lifetime opportunity so. go.

199
00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:26.110
I guess so.

200
00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:28.828
- I have an idea.
- Yeah?

201
00:10:29.453 --> 00:10:31.455
Why don't I take you out
for breakfast tomorrow?

202
00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:32.248
Just you and me.

203
00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:34.083
- Yeah. sure.
- Yeah?

204
00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.377
Good idea. Ask Grace. too.

205
00:10:37.962 --> 00:10:38.629
Come on. now.

206
00:10:40.297 --> 00:10:42.300
Till now. do you still think
of me that way?

207
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.136
Don't be silly. Rome.
You're like a brother to me.

208
00:10:45.364 --> 00:10:47.487
And besides. you mentored me.

209
00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:51.267
And to be honest. I thought
you and Grace were already dating.

210
00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:53.127
I see your sweet posts about her.

211
00:10:54.912 --> 00:10:57.248
Well. honestly. we're getting
to know each other.

212
00:10:57.273 --> 00:10:59.108
but you know. that's it. But...

213
00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:01.277
So are you dating or not?

214
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:04.113
Honestly. you'll have to ask her.

215
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.991
Don't worry. I'll hype you up.

216
00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:11.604
I'll tell her it's her loss
if she lets you get away.

217
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.525
Wow.

218
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.588
Promise.

219
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:16.625
- Deal.
- I swear.

220
00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:22.214
No. it was twelve when
we managed to get away--

221
00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.924
Too bad. it could've been your gift to him.

222
00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:26.135
Right. then it turned into trauma.

223
00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:27.424
What a gift!

224
00:11:29.486 --> 00:11:33.851
- Hey. girls!
- Hi!

225
00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:34.894
Hello!

226
00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:35.978
Are you feeling better?

227
00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.021
Yes. I'm good.

228
00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:38.681
Why? What happened?

229
00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:40.267
I'll tell you in a bit. okay?

230
00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:42.610
Is she on a rampage again?

231
00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.049
What else?

232
00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:47.073
Isn't she always?

233
00:11:47.377 --> 00:11:49.294
Must be a black-belter thing.

234
00:11:49.694 --> 00:11:51.228
She's so gutsy.

235
00:11:51.853 --> 00:11:52.993
You know why.

236
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.212
She's always been that way.

237
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.752
So. what happened?

238
00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:02.505
Who needed defending this time?

239
00:12:03.297 --> 00:12:06.300
Sis. we're not in university anymore.

240
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:11.305
Girls. you don't leave
your principles in school.

241
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.783
You don't just run out of it. y'know?

242
00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:15.851
Forget what I said.

243
00:12:16.227 --> 00:12:17.895
Your fault for bringing it up.

244
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.979
Well. sorry.

245
00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.486
Anyway. girls.

246
00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.585
Clear your schedule tonight.

247
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.362
We have an important date.

248
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:28.197
Am I included in this?

249
00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:28.906
No. just her...

250
00:12:28.906 --> 00:12:30.716
Come with me tonight. yeah?

251
00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:32.493
I meant all three of us. duh!

252
00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:33.536
Okay. Where?

253
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.377
Double- I mean. we're going
on a triple date.

254
00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:38.463
I set this up for you.

255
00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:41.564
Sorry. guys. I can't make it.

256
00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.130
You know I got tons to do. right?

257
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.132
I haven't even packed everything.

258
00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:49.885
Come on. Rach.
Just this last time before you go?

259
00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:51.387
It's literally our last night together.

260
00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:52.721
- She's right.
- Come on!

261
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:55.057
Let's have some fun. please?

262
00:12:56.183 --> 00:12:57.184
Okay. okay.

263
00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.853
- Here's your coffee. ma'am.
- Thank you.

264
00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:01.535
Who are you trying to set us up with?

265
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.064
I met someone. His name is Julius.

266
00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:08.028
He's pretty cool. Manila boy.

267
00:13:08.724 --> 00:13:10.976
He's with a couple of friends.

268
00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:13.325
Says they're site-viewing.

269
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.202
For a business proposal or something.

270
00:13:15.397 --> 00:13:17.249
Monkey business. probably.

271
00:13:17.274 --> 00:13:18.359
Don't be such a downer.

272
00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:22.293
Girls. you know those types.

273
00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:25.597
They dig around for gold in Baguio

274
00:13:25.622 --> 00:13:27.465
put up their businesses.

275
00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:29.984
then exploit their workers.

276
00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:33.179
and as soon as they cash in. that's it.

277
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.889
- Can you chill out?
- We're left to clean up after them.

278
00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:35.847
You bet.

279
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.111
Don't speak for everybody. bestie.

280
00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:38.951
Exactly.

281
00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:43.105
It's just a date! You know what.
you really need to get laid.

282
00:13:43.314 --> 00:13:45.149
You're too upright!

283
00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:48.194
I swear. you need to get laid.

284
00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.112
- I don't need to water anything.
- You're so gross!

285
00:13:50.112 --> 00:13:51.488
It's true. though!

286
00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:54.700
We're not getting any younger. are we?

287
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.701
- Speak for yourself!
- Speak for yourself!

288
00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.369
Yes. fine. It's always me. isn't it?

289
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.081
But see. I really wanna find 'the one'!

290
00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:04.043
- The one?
- So I can finally settle down. be a bride…

291
00:14:04.418 --> 00:14:05.419
Be a mother!

292
00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:06.541
You're the one to talk!

293
00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:10.049
As for me. I don't wanna get married yet.

294
00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.635
All I want is a new boyfriend.

295
00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:13.971
That's because you're going to the nunnery!

296
00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:17.002
Stop it!

297
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.635
It's your own business. okay?

298
00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:22.770
Rach. what's wrong with
having a partner in life?

299
00:14:23.327 --> 00:14:27.439
Just because you're looking
for a daddy. not a boyfriend!

300
00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:28.877
Girls.

301
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:34.865
will you be mad at me
if I don't make it tonight?

302
00:14:35.412 --> 00:14:37.135
Of course!

303
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.179
It's out last night out. Come on!

304
00:14:40.204 --> 00:14:41.705
Yeah. Please?

305
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.016
Okay. What time?

306
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:46.460
Yes! Beats. 7:00 p.m.

307
00:14:46.658 --> 00:14:48.629
- 7:00 p.m?
- Yes!

308
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:49.546
It's so early.

309
00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:52.550
So we can party harder. jeez.
It's our last chance.

310
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.426
As if she'll actually go home with anyone.

311
00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:57.680
- Right? She always backs out last minute.
- True.

312
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.639
Hey sister. shh.

313
00:15:00.557 --> 00:15:01.725
Have some respect.

314
00:15:02.726 --> 00:15:03.894
Don't undress her--

315
00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.738
- I'll miss you girls.
- We'll miss you more.

316
00:15:14.738 --> 00:15:16.115
Just stay here.

317
00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:16.573
Yeah.

318
00:15:16.573 --> 00:15:17.950
- Please?
- Please?

319
00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:19.660
Just stay with us!

320
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:24.415
- How could you leave us.
- Yeah. just stay here.

321
00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:27.809
I'll really miss you.
Look out for each other. okay?

322
00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:28.994
You look out for yourself.

323
00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:31.792
You should calm down
and stop fighting everyone.

324
00:15:32.143 --> 00:15:33.697
No nun friends there.

325
00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:44.101
Pa. I'm going now.

326
00:15:46.103 --> 00:15:48.105
But I'll come back soon.

327
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.736
Two years will go by really quickly.

328
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.820
And...

329
00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:59.158
I left Uncle Oscar in charge of the house.

330
00:16:09.243 --> 00:16:10.590
Don't worry. Pa.

331
00:16:12.979 --> 00:16:14.298
I'll be fine.

332
00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:16.967
Besides.

333
00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:21.721
You taught me to be brave.

334
00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:27.353
to take care of myself and to survive.

335
00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:34.190
I'll never forget that. Pa.

336
00:16:37.682 --> 00:16:39.740
I love you very much.

337
00:17:01.945 --> 00:17:05.199
Oh my god! Finally!

338
00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:09.395
- Sorry. sis.
- I've rotted in my seat waiting for you!

339
00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:12.606
We thought you were ditching us
for your bed!

340
00:17:12.606 --> 00:17:13.775
Almost.

341
00:17:14.316 --> 00:17:17.778
Your bed isn't gonna make you happy!

342
00:17:17.878 --> 00:17:21.340
Look around! Plenty of boys
and men in here.

343
00:17:21.365 --> 00:17:24.201
Sis. boys are just a bonus.

344
00:17:24.226 --> 00:17:26.770
I only care about being here with you.

345
00:17:26.994 --> 00:17:30.833
And please. stop making men
as the center of everything!

346
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:33.352
The world evolves.
so you should. too!

347
00:17:33.377 --> 00:17:37.057
Hey. Rach? Count me out
of that talk. alright?

348
00:17:37.082 --> 00:17:39.608
All I want right now
is to get laid!

349
00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:42.428
- You foul-mouthed bitch!
- That's not what I meant!

350
00:17:42.453 --> 00:17:43.620
You guys are so serious!

351
00:17:43.887 --> 00:17:45.580
We're gonna miss you.

352
00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.434
You're gonna make me cry.

353
00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:51.145
Anna. it's not like
I'll be gone for good.

354
00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:54.106
Besides. we have messenger
and viber. you know!

355
00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:56.567
Nothing beats having you
with us in the flesh!

356
00:17:57.424 --> 00:18:01.488
Alright. for tonight. I will
enjoy myself so let's go. guys!

357
00:18:01.488 --> 00:18:02.656
That's more like it.

358
00:18:03.056 --> 00:18:04.089
Hi!

359
00:18:04.114 --> 00:18:06.910
- Hello.
- How's it going?

360
00:18:06.935 --> 00:18:10.205
Meet my friends Rachel. Hannah.

361
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.999
Hello. Hello. Come meet my friends.

362
00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:14.376
Glad you could make it.

363
00:18:14.376 --> 00:18:16.879
Yeah. Rachel made
us wait for so long.

364
00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:18.005
We couldn't wait to see you.

365
00:18:18.213 --> 00:18:20.736
Let's go!

366
00:18:22.342 --> 00:18:24.219
- This is Vince--
- Hi. ladies!

367
00:18:24.219 --> 00:18:25.104
Si Dennis.

368
00:18:26.557 --> 00:18:28.891
Rachel and Hannah.

369
00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:30.792
Nice to meet you.

370
00:18:32.102 --> 00:18:34.072
It's good! Super good!

371
00:18:34.354 --> 00:18:36.080
Do you come here often?

372
00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:39.276
Yeah. this is where we hang out.

373
00:18:39.401 --> 00:18:40.729
Really glad you guys showed up.

374
00:18:40.903 --> 00:18:43.166
Rachel held us up a bit.

375
00:18:47.117 --> 00:18:49.661
Let's go!

376
00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:54.917
Don't be a killjoy!

377
00:18:57.503 --> 00:18:59.379
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

378
00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:16.188
It's really good. I promise.

379
00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.572
Both of us. come on!

380
00:20:19.376 --> 00:20:23.338
Okay. I never knew
it was an actual thing.

381
00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:25.340
What do you mean?

382
00:20:25.966 --> 00:20:29.219
The only anthropologist I know
is Indiana Jones.

383
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.657
Correction. he's an archaelogist.

384
00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:35.517
- What?
- Yes!

385
00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.144
It's the same thing!

386
00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:42.733
They're different fields but interrelated.
You know what I mean?

387
00:20:42.758 --> 00:20:45.640
Nope! But okay.

388
00:20:47.904 --> 00:20:51.742
So does your work
take you to the field a lot?

389
00:20:51.742 --> 00:20:55.579
Not always. It largely depends
on getting a research grant.

390
00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:56.711
Why do you ask?

391
00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.624
Nothing. just curious.

392
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.422
Did I crush your prejudice
against my type of profession?

393
00:21:05.447 --> 00:21:11.244
Or were you expecting an old lady
fiddling with bones and fossils all day?

394
00:21:11.386 --> 00:21:12.596
No. of course not.

395
00:21:14.264 --> 00:21:18.685
- A little bit.
- Well. people and their expectations.

396
00:21:18.685 --> 00:21:20.145
What? What's that supposed to mean?

397
00:21:20.562 --> 00:21:23.815
Nah. I'm guilty of that. too. sometimes…

398
00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:26.827
About prejudice and expectations. you know?

399
00:21:27.736 --> 00:21:29.529
Especially towards outsiders.

400
00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:33.241
So just because I’m from Manila.
means I'm a threat?

401
00:21:33.241 --> 00:21:33.825
Is that it?

402
00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.242
Okay.

403
00:21:40.624 --> 00:21:42.500
How many years have you been working?

404
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:45.515
Two years here and abroad.

405
00:21:46.088 --> 00:21:49.566
- Abroad?
- Yeah. Melbourne for Masterals.

406
00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:51.398
- Where?
- Melbourne.

407
00:21:52.476 --> 00:21:54.750
So when are you leaving for Manila?

408
00:21:55.055 --> 00:21:56.640
Don't think about that.

409
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.892
Important thing is.
we're together right now.

410
00:22:04.648 --> 00:22:07.150
Slow down.
I don't want my friends to see.

411
00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:10.070
Let them be. They're all adults.

412
00:22:19.913 --> 00:22:20.956
You want?

413
00:22:22.124 --> 00:22:23.593
I don’t want it.

414
00:22:23.896 --> 00:22:25.241
I love it.

415
00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:29.764
Don't forget later. then.

416
00:22:29.797 --> 00:22:30.799
Which one?

417
00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:32.884
Give me what I want.

418
00:22:33.325 --> 00:22:34.642
It depends.

419
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.499
Come on.

420
00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:39.022
But I'm not yet ready.

421
00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:40.936
I'll take care of you. don't worry.

422
00:22:46.314 --> 00:22:48.745
I told you we'd have a great time.

423
00:22:51.274 --> 00:22:52.322
Right?

424
00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.673
- Wait. hang on.
- What's the matter?

425
00:22:54.698 --> 00:22:55.407
What's the matter?

426
00:22:55.432 --> 00:22:57.300
Everyone's looking.

427
00:22:57.325 --> 00:22:59.863
- That's alright. silly.
- You're too fast.

428
00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:02.311
Huh? I'm too fast?

429
00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:03.348
Yeah.

430
00:23:03.373 --> 00:23:05.539
Okay. It's fine. actually.

431
00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:10.425
May I ask.

432
00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:13.652
how old are you again?

433
00:23:14.468 --> 00:23:16.574
I'm 18.

434
00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:18.597
Wow! 18.

435
00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:23.101
Wow! We're the same age. then.

436
00:23:23.815 --> 00:23:24.956
Really now?

437
00:23:26.674 --> 00:23:27.761
You know.

438
00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:31.067
I had my first sexual experience
when I was 18.

439
00:23:32.152 --> 00:23:33.403
You're unbelievable.

440
00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:37.282
I'm unbelievable. Wow.

441
00:23:37.347 --> 00:23:40.152
I had my first kiss when I was 21.

442
00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:43.705
Hang on. I thought you were 18?

443
00:23:43.914 --> 00:23:45.207
Now you're 21.

444
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:46.750
- Which is it?
- Sorry.

445
00:23:47.417 --> 00:23:49.836
- So how old are you really?
- Truth is. I'm 23.

446
00:23:50.921 --> 00:23:54.257
- Yeah.
- Well. you don't look 23 for me.

447
00:23:54.257 --> 00:23:56.009
I'm feeling shy. actually.

448
00:23:56.927 --> 00:23:59.930
Don't be. We're all here
to enjoy ourselves.

449
00:24:00.388 --> 00:24:02.140
Okay?
Cheers?

450
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.142
Engineer or architect?

451
00:24:05.602 --> 00:24:07.062
Why? Is it because of the way I look?

452
00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:10.524
- Yeah.
- And I'm the prejudiced one?

453
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:13.443
- Also an R.K.
- R.K.?

454
00:24:13.944 --> 00:24:17.030
Okay. wait. Aspiring architect-
you got that right.

455
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.443
But R.K.. no.

456
00:24:18.532 --> 00:24:19.508
I'm not a rich kid.

457
00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:21.117
My parents. sure. They're rich.

458
00:24:21.117 --> 00:24:21.910
Yeah. right.

459
00:24:21.935 --> 00:24:23.353
But I'm not.

460
00:24:23.498 --> 00:24:24.607
Yeah. right.

461
00:24:24.632 --> 00:24:26.505
We gotta work hard to earn things. right?

462
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.525
Money. especially.

463
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:34.189
I thought you were a rich kid.
Your friends certainly look like they are.

464
00:24:34.214 --> 00:24:36.091
They're rich kids. alright.

465
00:24:36.383 --> 00:24:38.218
For sure. Especially that one.

466
00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:39.771
They're my college friends.

467
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:42.347
Cool people but super rowdy.

468
00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:44.607
This one's the naughtiest.

469
00:24:50.438 --> 00:24:52.107
This one's the naughtiest.

470
00:24:53.233 --> 00:24:54.150
Look at his face--

471
00:24:57.404 --> 00:25:00.782
Hear that? That beat.

472
00:25:01.449 --> 00:25:03.577
Hey guys. let's go!

473
00:25:03.827 --> 00:25:05.662
Let's dance! Come on!

474
00:25:05.662 --> 00:25:07.310
Guys! Let's go!

475
00:25:08.164 --> 00:25:09.958
- Let's go!
- What's happening?

476
00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:17.134
Let's go! Let's go!

477
00:25:26.485 --> 00:25:29.570
Wait! How do you dance like that?

478
00:25:32.517 --> 00:25:33.797
Is it like this?

479
00:25:57.047 --> 00:25:58.715
Hey! What are you doing here?

480
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.508
You're not allowed in here.

481
00:26:02.469 --> 00:26:03.560
Wait. wait.

482
00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:04.378
You don't want it?

483
00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:08.266
- There are people.
- So?

484
00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:12.520
You're making me nervous.

485
00:26:12.743 --> 00:26:13.566
Wait--

486
00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:22.930
Wait--

487
00:26:24.824 --> 00:26:25.742
Let them see.

488
00:26:32.347 --> 00:26:33.445
I like you.

489
00:26:33.841 --> 00:26:34.923
I know.

490
00:26:35.837 --> 00:26:37.562
I'm glad you're here.

491
00:26:37.587 --> 00:26:40.006
You're the one who keeps changing plans.

492
00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:41.257
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

493
00:26:41.257 --> 00:26:42.467
I was just waiting for you.

494
00:26:44.093 --> 00:26:45.703
You're the flaky one.

495
00:26:50.094 --> 00:26:51.324
You wanna fly?

496
00:26:51.704 --> 00:26:52.805
How?

497
00:26:52.852 --> 00:26:55.743
Like a ghost? A bird?

498
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:03.363
- Someone might come in. What's that?
- Who cares.

499
00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:11.913
This will calm you down.

500
00:27:11.913 --> 00:27:12.831
You first.

501
00:27:12.856 --> 00:27:13.914
Sure.

502
00:27:24.092 --> 00:27:26.219
See? Nothing happened to me.

503
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.064
Why'd you waste that?

504
00:27:38.314 --> 00:27:40.025
- Why did you spit it out?
- It's bitter! The hell is that?

505
00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.568
Of course it's bitter. It's a tablet.

506
00:27:43.737 --> 00:27:44.946
You can't be in here.

507
00:27:44.946 --> 00:27:45.447
I know.

508
00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:49.681
Jealous bitch. I'll pull your hair.

509
00:27:58.168 --> 00:28:00.503
What's going on here?
Men aren't allowed here.

510
00:28:01.504 --> 00:28:03.381
- I know.
- This is the ladies' room. sir.

511
00:28:05.008 --> 00:28:08.178
Go! I told you you can't be here.

512
00:28:11.347 --> 00:28:13.141
Go on. get out of here!

513
00:28:33.828 --> 00:28:34.704
You cool? Can you handle him?

514
00:28:34.704 --> 00:28:35.580
Let's go! Let's go!

515
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.182
Are you sure?

516
00:28:37.207 --> 00:28:38.541
He's not even drunk yet!

517
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:39.876
You ain't seen nothing yet.

518
00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:42.670
You want a drink? You okay?

519
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.671
- Yeah.
- You okay?

520
00:28:43.671 --> 00:28:45.298
- Yeah.
- Sure?

521
00:28:46.174 --> 00:28:47.175
Let me get your drink.

522
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.439
Hey. are you okay?

523
00:29:01.731 --> 00:29:02.941
- Yeah.
- Hey! Say sorry!

524
00:29:03.358 --> 00:29:11.829
- Watch where you're going!
- The fuck is your problem?

525
00:29:11.879 --> 00:29:14.715
- Hey! Cut it out!
- Fuck you!

526
00:29:16.778 --> 00:29:17.747
Dude. let me go!

527
00:29:17.772 --> 00:29:20.762
I'm good! I'm good!

528
00:29:22.168 --> 00:29:25.839
- What happened?
- Vince. it's fine. I'm fine.

529
00:29:27.457 --> 00:29:28.734
Let's go. Come on.

530
00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.302
Hello. Ma? Yes. Ma.

531
00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:32.846
Yeah. I'm with my friends. Ma.

532
00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:34.785
It's my send-off party. remember?

Sup. Elijah? How's it going?

00:30:19.042 --> 00:30:21.516
Guess what? We're on our way there.

543
00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:23.563
What? On your way to Baguio?

544
00:30:23.616 --> 00:30:24.539
Yessir.

545
00:30:24.564 --> 00:30:25.398

I'm with the crazies and we have company.

549
00:30:32.614 --> 00:30:34.657
Chicks! Yes! I can't wait.

550
00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.701
You shithead. I didn't prepare anything.

551
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.037
My maid's not here.

552
00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.747
Especially for you!

553

Hurry up!

00:30:47.837 --> 00:30:50.048
This will melt your brain. bro.

557
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.716
This is some Van Gogh shit.

558
00:30:51.782 --> 00:30:56.138
That's what I like about you!
Boy scout! My man!

559

Okay. Julius.

561
00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.225
Alright. Take care.

562
00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:07.398
Elijah's an old friend?

563
00:31:07.423 --> 00:31:09.157
Yeah. pretty much.

564
00:31:12.695 --> 00:31:15.323
He can get a bit wild sometimes
but he's a regular weirdo.

565
00:31:15.323 --> 00:31:16.905
He's cool.

566
00:31:37.971 --> 00:31:40.723
Hey! Come on in!

567
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.812
Guys! Guys! Come in. come in.
Welcome to my humble abode.

568
00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:47.397
I hope you like it.

569
00:31:47.397 --> 00:31:49.440
- You know us!
- Bro. I miss you!

570
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.359
I miss you!

571
00:31:51.693 --> 00:31:53.611

572
00:31:54.404 --> 00:31:57.240
- Nice to see you. good boy.

573
00:31:58.574 --> 00:31:59.534
Roomy. huh?

574
00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:00.910
Such a big house.

575
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:01.661
This is where we hang out.

576
00:32:01.713 --> 00:32:06.541
Julius. you didn't tell me you
were coming but I'm so glad you're here!

577
00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:07.875
I'm so sorry.

578
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.044
Sorry the place is a bit dusty.

579
00:32:10.753 --> 00:32:12.839
It's just me looking after the house.

580
00:32:13.047 --> 00:32:15.258
Elijah. this is Sydney. Rachel. and Hannah.

581
00:32:15.258 --> 00:32:16.274
Hi.

582
00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:17.592
Hello.

583
00:32:17.617 --> 00:32:19.204

584
00:32:20.096 --> 00:32:21.097

585
00:32:21.097 --> 00:32:22.223
- Yep.
- Yes.

586
00:32:22.223 --> 00:32:23.449
Cool. Where?

587
00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:24.809
- Harrison.
- Wow.

588
00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:25.601
Teachers' Camp.

589
00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:26.938
Cool.

590
00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.479
Near Session Road.

591
00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.940
Cool. Yes! Awesome.

592
00:32:31.566 --> 00:32:33.651
So you're in love with each other then?

593
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.156
You know what. we're kind of thirsty.

594
00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:38.990
Oh yeah?

595
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.700
We're looking forward
to what you're serving.

596
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.954
Okay. we'll just get things ready.
Relax. Just feel at home.

597
00:32:44.954 --> 00:32:46.289
Julius. I'll borrow you for a moment.

598
00:32:46.289 --> 00:32:49.626
- Let's go fix the--
- Go explore. if you want.

599
00:32:49.651 --> 00:32:50.625
This is cool.

600
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.652
Check out this painting.

601
00:32:53.899 --> 00:32:55.276
Vince. you okay?

602
00:32:55.381 --> 00:32:57.633
Yeah. no problem.
Just annoyed about earlier.

603
00:32:57.633 --> 00:32:59.260
I know. right. What a hassle.

604
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.636
Bros.

605
00:33:00.636 --> 00:33:02.347
Who were those fuckers anyway?
They just charged at us.

606
00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:03.890
Here are the drinks--what fuckers?

607
00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.809
I'm from here.
One call and they're finished.

608
00:33:06.809 --> 00:33:09.937
We ran into a hassle back at the club.
That's why we got kicked out.

609
00:33:09.937 --> 00:33:12.106
- Got it. let's talk about that later.
- We've been waiting for this.

610
00:33:12.106 --> 00:33:14.275
I'm upset with you guys.

611
00:33:14.484 --> 00:33:17.195
Why'd you have to go to a club when
you could've just gone straight here?

612
00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:18.613
You're always welcome to crash.

613
00:33:18.638 --> 00:33:19.822
Let's do shots. then.

614
00:33:19.822 --> 00:33:21.574
Right. let's go.

615
00:33:21.574 --> 00:33:22.867
I've really missed you guys.

616
00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:24.369
We wanna get drunk.

617
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.871
For the ladies.

618
00:33:27.497 --> 00:33:28.247
There we go.

619
00:33:30.911 --> 00:33:32.610
Straight cup. okay?

620
00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:34.128
What are you up to these days?

621
00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:37.079
Same old.

622
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.549
Just drop by anytime.

623
00:33:38.966 --> 00:33:40.968
If you feel like it. ring me up.

624
00:33:41.718 --> 00:33:42.917
So. cheers?

625
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.681

It's strong!

628
00:33:56.651 --> 00:33:59.195
We missed this. We missed that.

629
00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:01.697
He used to be this small.
now he's a big boy.

630
00:34:01.697 --> 00:34:03.199
That I am!

631
00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:05.076
You missed me. didn't you?

632
00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:06.244
You bet.

633
00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:07.993
One more.

634
00:34:08.144 --> 00:34:09.391
Another round.

635
00:34:10.242 --> 00:34:11.915
- Want more?
- Sure.

636
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.102
- Game!
- I'm game.

637
00:34:14.127 --> 00:34:15.431
Don't be a killjoy.

638
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:18.005
- It's just the second round. come on.
- Thank you.

639
00:34:19.046 --> 00:34:20.172
No. I'm good.

640
00:34:20.197 --> 00:34:21.032
You betcha.

641
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.373
Shot. Shot.

642
00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:23.486
Cheers.

643
00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:25.185
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

644
00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:32.728
Excuse me. where's the restroom?

645
00:34:32.728 --> 00:34:35.915
Our restroom's out of order.

646
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.109
But. I'll show you.
Go upstairs. to your left--

647
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:39.819
- I'll just come with you.
- Bestie. I'll go with you.

648
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.071
Let's go.

649
00:34:48.202 --> 00:34:50.538
Go straight up and then turn right.

650
00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:53.332
- Okay. thanks.
- Thanks.

651
00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:10.475
What is this place?

652
00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.726
It's kind of weird. actually--

653
00:35:11.726 --> 00:35:14.854
It's a really big house. huh?
He lives here alone?

654
00:35:14.854 --> 00:35:16.482
He's probably with his family. duh.

655
00:35:16.564 --> 00:35:19.375
Girls. are you okay?

656
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.359
Yeah.

657
00:35:20.735 --> 00:35:22.737
They seem okay.

658
00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:25.948
Please. it's gonna be fine.
I've been talking to Julius for a while.

659
00:35:26.115 --> 00:35:28.388
But. girl. actually--

660
00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:34.927
- Dennis made a move on me earlier.
- What did he do?

661
00:35:36.125 --> 00:35:37.376
He put his--

662
00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.002
His what?

663
00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:39.020
His dick or finger?

664
00:35:39.045 --> 00:35:41.297
- Shh. his finger.
- It's just a finger!

665
00:35:41.297 --> 00:35:43.132
Make a fuss if it was a spoon.
vibrator. his schlong…

666
00:35:43.132 --> 00:35:44.342
Just be on your toes. okay.

667
00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.818
Tell that to her.
I know what I'm doing.

668
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.030
I swear to god.

669
00:35:49.055 --> 00:35:50.515
- But. girl--
- Yeah?

670
00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.183
Did you bring a condom?

671
00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:53.755
You're ready?

672
00:35:54.101 --> 00:35:56.312
Not yet. but you never know.

673
00:35:56.312 --> 00:35:58.523
When you're ready.
I have some right here. okay?

674
00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:00.552
I have extra so you'll have some.

675
00:36:02.318 --> 00:36:04.904
You're about to get your
mind blown. Julius. Ready?

676
00:36:04.904 --> 00:36:08.824
Fuck. man. you think
I can't take it? You think I can't?

677
00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:12.286
Welcome. Sylvia Sanchez.

678
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:16.040
Is this the baby you're so proud of?

679
00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:19.669
Wait. wait. wait. Let me breathe. Game.

680
00:36:20.127 --> 00:36:23.840

Wait. wait.

683
00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.428
Double check. Double check.

684
00:36:29.428 --> 00:36:30.596
Eye check. Eye check.

685
00:36:33.808 --> 00:36:35.017

- Hey. what's that?

688
00:36:41.983 --> 00:36:43.734
- Huh?
- What is it?

689
00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:44.819
Just watch.

690
00:36:57.039 --> 00:36:58.541
Breathe. Breathe.

691
00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.584
Are you still there?

692
00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:02.003
Are you okay?

693
00:37:02.169 --> 00:37:03.170
Wait. break. Time out.

694
00:37:08.058 --> 00:37:09.262
What's happening?

695
00:37:16.017 --> 00:37:17.226
What are you gonna do. Julius?

696
00:37:23.816 --> 00:37:25.026
Wanna try it?

697
00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:26.294
What's this?

698
00:37:28.792 --> 00:37:29.855
Motherfuc--

699
00:37:35.369 --> 00:37:37.288
And there he goes.

700
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.835
Fly high. my friend.

701
00:37:43.252 --> 00:37:44.337
What's happening?

702
00:37:45.087 --> 00:37:46.589
- What's happening to him?
- What was that?

703
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:47.757
He's talking to God.

704
00:37:47.757 --> 00:37:49.258
Fly and enjoy the trip.

705
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.191
Is he really okay?

706
00:37:55.216 --> 00:37:56.932
He's more than okay.

707
00:37:57.516 --> 00:37:59.018
He's on a freaking cloud.

708
00:38:00.186 --> 00:38:01.454
What was it?

709
00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.965
Jul. are you okay?

710
00:38:04.121 --> 00:38:05.746
- Throw him a blanket.
- Are you okay?

711
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.441
He can't understand me.

712
00:38:10.446 --> 00:38:11.572
What are you guys doing?

713
00:38:11.572 --> 00:38:12.490
What's that?

714
00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:14.367
Is it good?

715
00:38:16.202 --> 00:38:17.620
Goodbye.

716
00:38:18.037 --> 00:38:18.954
Is it solid. bro?

717
00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:25.419
- What's happening?
- Try it out later.

718
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:26.462
Jul. you thirsty?

719
00:38:27.755 --> 00:38:28.422
Water.

720
00:38:28.714 --> 00:38:29.924
Are you still there. Julius?

721
00:38:31.717 --> 00:38:32.927
Julius. you're still alive. huh?

722
00:38:32.927 --> 00:38:33.928
Is he alright?

723
00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:39.725
He's coming back. I think.

724
00:38:40.768 --> 00:38:41.894
Fuck. man.

725
00:38:46.565 --> 00:38:50.152
Hey. hey. Where you going?

726
00:38:50.152 --> 00:38:54.115
Don't. Don't. Boy. no.

727
00:38:54.615 --> 00:38:56.075
No. boy.

728
00:38:56.075 --> 00:38:57.535
No. no. boy.

729
00:38:58.619 --> 00:38:59.662
Go take a break.

730
00:39:02.164 --> 00:39:03.499
Shit!

731
00:39:04.957 --> 00:39:09.505
- Where are you going?
- Don't! Don't.

732
00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:15.511
That's fire. Fire.

733
00:39:15.511 --> 00:39:17.012
Fireplace. You'll get burned.

734
00:39:17.012 --> 00:39:20.133
That's fire! That's bad!

735
00:39:20.516 --> 00:39:22.017
Time-out. Time-out.

736
00:39:22.768 --> 00:39:24.353
Just don't go burning yourself. okay?

737
00:39:24.854 --> 00:39:25.932
I'm good.

738
00:39:25.957 --> 00:39:26.939
You good?

739
00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.149
Fuck. man.

740
00:39:28.174 --> 00:39:30.276
Is it something else. man?

741
00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:38.701
There he goes.

742
00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:42.621
Yakuza!

743
00:39:51.547 --> 00:39:54.425
Shit. you looked so fucked up. Look.

744
00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:57.887
If you tried that shit.
you'd be fucked up. too.

745
00:39:58.012 --> 00:40:00.765
What the fuck did you see?
What were you feeling?

746
00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:02.141
Fuck. it's hard to explain.

747
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:03.684
Heaven? Hell? What?

748
00:40:03.684 --> 00:40:06.395
- Heaven. of course. Freaking heaven.
- Shit. I wanna try. too!

749
00:40:06.687 --> 00:40:07.863
Come on.

750
00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:09.982
It's not mine. though.

751
00:40:10.566 --> 00:40:11.317
Doesn't matter.

752
00:40:11.317 --> 00:40:12.526
- Besides. you can't handle that shit.
- You can just ask for me.

753
00:40:12.526 --> 00:40:15.237
- You won't be able to withstand it.
- Look! Look at you. fuck!

754
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.448
What a clown.

755
00:40:18.991 --> 00:40:19.533
What?

756
00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:23.496
What's up?

757
00:40:25.748 --> 00:40:27.374
You idiot.

758
00:40:54.735 --> 00:40:55.361
Cheers?

759
00:40:55.778 --> 00:40:56.403
Cheers.

760
00:41:01.617 --> 00:41:03.702
We finally made it.

761
00:41:10.209 --> 00:41:11.418
Wait. wait. wait.

762
00:41:12.086 --> 00:41:13.295
You're going too fast.

763
00:41:17.383 --> 00:41:18.092
Come. let's sit.

764
00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.577
Wait. wait. wait.

765
00:41:47.788 --> 00:41:48.497
Sorry.

766
00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:00.634
It's a nice painting. huh?

767
00:42:01.343 --> 00:42:04.096
Ah. yeah. Elijah made that.

768
00:42:04.513 --> 00:42:06.265
He's a talented motherfucker.

769
00:42:11.437 --> 00:42:12.479
Lie down with me.

770
00:42:17.818 --> 00:42:19.153
I have a--

771
00:42:20.863 --> 00:42:21.572
What is it?

772
00:42:22.615 --> 00:42:23.949
I need to tell you something.

773
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.117
What is it?

774
00:42:25.618 --> 00:42:26.869
But don't laugh at me. promise?

775
00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:27.494
I promise.

776
00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:31.832
What is it?

777
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:33.334
It's just that…

778
00:42:35.878 --> 00:42:37.171
The thing is--

779
00:42:43.344 --> 00:42:44.803
I'm still a virgin.

780
00:42:46.889 --> 00:42:48.349
Hey. don't laugh.

781
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:49.266
No. really?

782
00:42:56.982 --> 00:42:57.983
I'll be gentle.

783
00:43:13.082 --> 00:43:13.582
Hey.

784
00:43:19.088 --> 00:43:20.047
Pour some more.

785
00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:21.382
Yeah. here.

786
00:43:21.757 --> 00:43:22.299
More?

787
00:43:22.675 --> 00:43:23.217
Yeah.

788
00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.403
Christ's sake. Vince.

789
00:43:42.695 --> 00:43:43.862
- What?
- What's your problem?

790
00:43:44.238 --> 00:43:45.406
Do we still need that?

791
00:43:45.698 --> 00:43:47.199
Why the hell not?

792
00:43:49.034 --> 00:43:51.203
- Just look at them.
- It's not for you. okay?

793
00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:52.538
Fuck. man.

794
00:43:54.581 --> 00:43:56.875
We're gonna do this. Okay?

795
00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.212
What. you wanna run home again?

796
00:44:00.421 --> 00:44:01.797
Fuck's sake. Vince.

797
00:44:02.214 --> 00:44:03.757
You're ruining our day.

798
00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:06.593
Just do it. Son of a bitch.

799
00:44:07.803 --> 00:44:10.806
My employer isn't using it anymore.
So I pretty much have it to myself.

800
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:12.850
Excuse me.

801
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.144
- Yep.
- Since when have you been staying here?

802
00:44:17.229 --> 00:44:18.105
Fuck. man.

803
00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:20.607
Okay.

804
00:44:27.573 --> 00:44:29.199
Oh. hey.

805
00:44:29.992 --> 00:44:30.993
You okay?

806
00:44:30.993 --> 00:44:32.150
Yes. You?

807
00:44:32.244 --> 00:44:34.246
- Yeah.
- Oh. right. Okay. okay.

808
00:44:34.413 --> 00:44:36.040
Your friends are just weird.

809
00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:38.834
- I was just escorting her.
- We're into different things.

810
00:44:38.834 --> 00:44:40.294
- Okay. Thanks. bro.
- We're into different things.

811
00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.218
Let's go outside.
I'll show you something.

812
00:44:51.013 --> 00:44:51.722
Nice view. huh?

813
00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:54.141
Yeah. it's peaceful here.

814
00:44:54.141 --> 00:44:54.767
Okay.

815
00:44:58.771 --> 00:44:59.563
Have a seat.

816
00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:06.528
Cheers.

817
00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:14.745
I think you'd better take this off.

818
00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.497
Want me to help you?

819
00:45:17.456 --> 00:45:19.166
- I can do it.
- It's okay.

820
00:45:20.667 --> 00:45:21.251
Let me.

821
00:45:24.004 --> 00:45:25.089
Not here.

822
00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.590
Huh? Why?

823
00:45:27.966 --> 00:45:29.176
It's nice out here.

824
00:45:43.398 --> 00:45:44.191
Are you enjoying this?

825
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.692
Mm-hm.

826
00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:50.489
Let's just do it here.

827
00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:52.533
I told you I don't want to.

828
00:45:52.533 --> 00:45:53.534
Why?

829
00:45:54.409 --> 00:45:55.744
Come closer.

830
00:46:04.586 --> 00:46:05.504
So you're really leaving?

831
00:46:06.505 --> 00:46:07.005
Yeah.

832
00:46:14.054 --> 00:46:14.972
For how long?

833
00:46:16.515 --> 00:46:18.534
Two years. remember? Two years.

834
00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:19.518
Ah yeah. right.

835
00:46:23.438 --> 00:46:24.898
Won't you change your mind?

836
00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.695
It's for my Masters. right?

837
00:46:29.945 --> 00:46:34.158
Besides. I haven't been
with my mom for so long.

838
00:46:35.075 --> 00:46:38.036
I mean. I haven't seen her for a long time.

839
00:46:41.707 --> 00:46:42.541
How long?

840
00:46:43.208 --> 00:46:44.459
I've lost count…

841
00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:47.921
That's why I'm looking forward
to this masteral.

842
00:46:48.422 --> 00:46:49.131
Because...

843
00:46:50.382 --> 00:46:51.884
I can't wait to see her.

844
00:46:52.759 --> 00:46:54.094
I can't wait to be with her.

845
00:46:56.388 --> 00:46:57.973
She's the only family I have left.

846
00:48:32.317 --> 00:48:33.193
You okay?

847
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:36.113
Let's go inside--

848
00:48:48.083 --> 00:48:48.667
Cheers?

849
00:48:48.667 --> 00:48:49.876
Cheers.

850
00:49:21.241 --> 00:49:23.201
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

851
00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:31.585
Come here.

852
00:49:32.586 --> 00:49:33.670
Why?

853
00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.066
Put it all in.

854
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.004
Hey. easy.

855
00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.182
Go. let it all out.

856
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:18.061
Hannah?

857
00:53:19.688 --> 00:53:20.689
Hannah. you okay?

858
00:53:21.606 --> 00:53:22.357
She's fine.

859
00:53:23.024 --> 00:53:24.192
- It's okay now.
- Come.

860
00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:34.744
I already told you to stop.

861
00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:40.125
I told you not to drink so much.

862
00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:42.877
Be careful.

863
00:53:46.506 --> 00:53:47.048
Here.

864
00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:49.509
Fuck that. man.

865
00:53:50.302 --> 00:53:51.261
You fucking serious?

866
00:53:52.012 --> 00:53:53.930
I'm out. man. Let's stop this. Fuck.

867
00:53:54.055 --> 00:53:55.348
For fuck's sake. Vince.

868
00:53:55.473 --> 00:53:56.016
What?

869
00:53:56.516 --> 00:53:57.976
We all agreed to the plan. alright?

870
00:53:57.976 --> 00:53:58.810
Are you serious?

871
00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.270
We're all in this.

872
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.147
- Are you chickening out again?
- I don't--

873
00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:03.231
You chickening out?

874
00:54:03.315 --> 00:54:04.566
Fuck this.

875
00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:07.777
You're ruining our fucking plan. man.

876
00:54:09.029 --> 00:54:11.239
This was our plan. All of us.

877
00:54:12.198 --> 00:54:13.283
Now you want out?

878
00:54:14.826 --> 00:54:16.077
You're just gonna leave us here?

879
00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:17.454
Are you fucking nuts?

880
00:54:18.997 --> 00:54:19.748
You're gonna ruin it?

881
00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:20.874
You're gonna ruin it?

882
00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.043
You're gonna ruin it for everyone?

883
00:54:27.047 --> 00:54:27.797
Fine. go home.

884
00:54:28.506 --> 00:54:29.883
Go home if you want.

885
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.302
You fucked up our plan.

886
00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:33.678
Fuck all of you.

887
00:54:34.095 --> 00:54:35.055
Fuck you. too.

888
00:54:36.097 --> 00:54:37.307
Shit. Vince. What's wrong with you?

889
00:54:37.332 --> 00:54:38.346
Where are you going?

890
00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:39.726
You're pissing me off.

891
00:54:40.352 --> 00:54:42.729
Vince here's getting cold feet.

892
00:54:42.729 --> 00:54:44.105
This son of a bitch.

893
00:54:44.105 --> 00:54:46.166
What the fuck. Vince.

894
00:54:46.191 --> 00:54:47.245
What?

895
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.069
Get in here. motherfucker.

896
00:54:52.822 --> 00:54:54.074
Vince. you little bitch.

897
00:54:54.949 --> 00:54:58.328
You insist on tagging along
then bail out last minute.

898
00:54:59.037 --> 00:55:00.288
You better not fuck this up.

899
00:55:01.206 --> 00:55:04.008
You'll do one simple fucking thing.

900
00:55:05.273 --> 00:55:06.586
Alright? Dude--

901
00:55:07.545 --> 00:55:08.880
Talk to this son of a bitch.

902
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.484
This little bitch.

903
00:55:11.609 --> 00:55:13.677
Vince. Vince...

904
00:55:15.726 --> 00:55:16.749
Come on.

905
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.019
See. I already told you not to drink.

906
00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:24.354
You just kept going.

907
00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:28.400
Look what happened.

908
00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:37.283
I told you not to force yourself.

909
00:55:46.668 --> 00:55:50.076
Girl. Dennis fingered me again.

910
00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:56.219
That's what you get for
being such a flirt like Sydney!

911
00:55:57.011 --> 00:56:00.056
Come on. let's go home. Silly girl.

912
00:56:00.849 --> 00:56:01.808
Let's go.

913
00:56:01.808 --> 00:56:02.767
Really?

914
00:56:02.767 --> 00:56:05.228
Yeah. we're going home.
We're going home. okay?

915
00:56:17.017 --> 00:56:18.053
Hurry up.

916
00:56:18.078 --> 00:56:19.158
I am.

917
00:56:21.966 --> 00:56:23.142
Stir it.

918
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:26.740
Go. Stir.

919
00:56:30.967 --> 00:56:32.485
- Yeah. I am.
- Finish stirring.

920
00:56:36.384 --> 00:56:38.011
How is she?

921
00:56:38.303 --> 00:56:40.722
Sorry. guys. We really need
to go home now.

922
00:56:40.722 --> 00:56:42.056
Hannah's drunk.

923
00:56:42.056 --> 00:56:45.185
We'll just take a cab and
we're just gonna wait for Sydney.

924
00:56:45.185 --> 00:56:47.312
- Don't you want to drink more?
- For the road.

925
00:56:47.312 --> 00:56:48.980
Nah. we're good. We're good.
We're going home.

926
00:56:49.189 --> 00:56:50.106
She's not here yet.

927
00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:52.442
No. Hannah can't take any more.

928
00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:53.359
No. she can.

929
00:56:54.027 --> 00:56:57.614
- Vince. I'll take care of this.
- No. I'm taking her home now.

930
00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:58.865
Don't you worry.

931
00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:00.992
Come on. Up.

932
00:57:01.534 --> 00:57:03.244
- You sure?
- Yup.

933
00:57:03.912 --> 00:57:05.413
Let's leave those two for now.

934
00:57:05.438 --> 00:57:06.456
- Here.
- Slowly.

935
00:57:06.481 --> 00:57:09.526
Okay. We're almost there.

936
00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:10.794
Warm water is all you need.

937
00:57:14.005 --> 00:57:14.881
You still good?

938
00:57:20.929 --> 00:57:24.349
Here. Over here. Okay.

939
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:26.029
You alright?

940
00:57:27.519 --> 00:57:29.020
Oops. careful.

941
00:57:33.775 --> 00:57:34.901
Rock and roll.

942
00:57:39.864 --> 00:57:43.243
- There.
- Stop touching me.

943
00:57:45.203 --> 00:57:49.749
I'm here. I'm here now. okay?

944
00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:53.044
Drink up so you'll feel better.

945
00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.338
Just a sip.

946
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:57.715
Just a little sip.

947
00:57:58.424 --> 00:57:59.634
So you'll feel better.

948
00:58:00.802 --> 00:58:01.636
Go on. drink.

949
00:58:02.762 --> 00:58:03.596
Drink.

950
00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:08.833
One more. One more.

951
00:58:49.201 --> 00:58:51.201
I'll take it from here.

952
00:58:58.526 --> 00:58:59.903
Move the glasses.

953
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.279
Out of the way.

954
00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:23.843
Fuck this shit.

955
00:59:25.303 --> 00:59:26.512
Okay.

956
00:59:26.512 --> 00:59:27.597
Okay. last sip.

957
00:59:27.847 --> 00:59:29.098
Just one last sip. okay?

958
00:59:29.849 --> 00:59:31.100
Just one last sip. go on.

959
00:59:31.452 --> 00:59:35.945
I don't want anymore.

960
00:59:36.689 --> 00:59:38.274
For fuck's sake.

961
00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.820
Just drink it. I'm trying
to make you feel better.

962
00:59:43.154 --> 00:59:43.988
What's the matter?

963
00:59:47.867 --> 00:59:49.452
You smell so good.

964
00:59:52.246 --> 00:59:53.831
I said no!

965
00:59:54.337 --> 00:59:57.794
I said it's the last.

966
00:59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.296
I said no!

967
01:00:14.227 --> 01:00:15.227
Stop!

968
01:01:37.435 --> 01:01:39.704
Yes! Yes!

969
01:01:40.104 --> 01:01:42.440
Yes! Yes!

970
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.733
Nice one! Macho!

971
01:01:45.026 --> 01:01:45.860
No. no. no!

972
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.181
Yes! Yes!

01:01:48.012 --> 01:01:49.297
Yes!

975
01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:50.590
Yes!

976
01:01:50.615 --> 01:01:52.501
Yes! Yes!

977
01:01:55.369 --> 01:01:55.912
Yes!

01:01:56.204 --> 01:01:56.746
Yes!

979
01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:57.622
Yes!

980
01:01:58.456 --> 01:01:59.499
No. no. no!

981
01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.459
Bro take a selfie.

982
01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.995
Let me take a selfie.

983
01:02:09.509 --> 01:02:10.093
Nice!

984
01:02:23.022 --> 01:02:24.861
Smile! Over here!

985
01:02:25.683 --> 01:02:27.564
Let's go. bro!

986
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:30.221
Let's take a selfie!

987
01:02:40.218 --> 01:02:41.846
Let me try.

988
01:02:45.378 --> 01:02:46.629
Snobby. I don't like her.

989
01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.720
She's nice!

990
01:03:26.009 --> 01:03:27.690
Are you done yet?

991
01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.231
Move. it's my turn.

992
01:04:28.648 --> 01:04:31.292
I said don't go away.

993
01:04:31.317 --> 01:04:32.318
Just stay here!

994
01:06:20.301 --> 01:06:21.886
Ow!

995
01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:34.332
Get back here! Hey!

996
01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.232
Get back here!

997
01:07:44.385 --> 01:07:45.261
Fuck. man.

998
01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.404
What do you want me to do?

999
01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:47.263
She fought back!

1000
01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:49.765
Shit! Shit! Motherfucker!

1001
01:07:51.392 --> 01:07:51.976
Shit!

Hey! Wake up!

1019
01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.419
This is your fault!

1020
01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:14.411
You kept resisting!

1021
01:09:18.938 --> 01:09:19.813
Sorry.

1022
01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:25.611
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

1023
01:09:30.491 --> 01:09:32.076
Wake up!

1024
01:09:33.327 --> 01:09:35.329

Wake up!

1028
01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.344
Bro. what's going on here?

1029
01:09:54.139 --> 01:09:55.766
I don't know. She was fine a while ago.

1030
01:10:00.354 --> 01:10:02.333
She was still breathing. bro.

1031
01:10:03.315 --> 01:10:05.414
She was okay.

1032
01:10:08.028 --> 01:10:09.594
What the fuck. Dennis.

1033
01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:13.284
Bro. help me.

1034
01:10:14.326 --> 01:10:15.619
I didn't mean to.

1035
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.909
She was fine just now.

1036
01:10:31.711 --> 01:10:33.307
Put a shirt on. Fuck.

1037
01:10:35.639 --> 01:10:36.724
Fuck!

1038
01:11:01.582 --> 01:11:03.250
Bro. what the hell is going on?

1039
01:11:06.219 --> 01:11:08.237
- That bitch fought back!
- Fuck.

1040
01:11:08.262 --> 01:11:09.423
What was I supposed to do?

1041
01:11:10.758 --> 01:11:14.386
Man. we like to fuck around
but we're not murderers!

1042
01:11:20.092 --> 01:11:21.636
This is your fucking fault!

1043
01:11:22.227 --> 01:11:24.438
Why are you blaming me? Asshole!

1044
01:11:24.463 --> 01:11:25.898
You got something out of it. didn't you?

1045
01:11:26.732 --> 01:11:27.274
Stop it!

1046
01:11:28.067 --> 01:11:28.525
Stop it!

1047
01:11:29.412 --> 01:11:33.197
What we need to do is think
about how to solve this mess!

1048
01:11:33.614 --> 01:11:35.324
What are we supposed to do
with the other one?

1049
01:11:36.045 --> 01:11:36.700
Huh?

1050
01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.458
Kill her.

1051
01:11:45.376 --> 01:11:46.752
Kill her?

1052
01:11:48.253 --> 01:11:49.129
What. you can't do it?

1053
01:11:50.132 --> 01:11:52.426
You got what you wanted. didn't you?

1054
01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:54.093
Do it!

1055
01:11:55.224 --> 01:11:56.268
Go upstairs.

1056
01:11:57.768 --> 01:11:58.592
Kill her.

1057
01:12:12.262 --> 01:12:13.320
Kill her.

1058
01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.381
Julius!

1059
01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.967
You bastard!

1060
01:13:22.514 --> 01:13:24.016
You fucking bastard!

1061
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:31.356
Fuck you. Julius!

1062
01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:06.952
So?

1063
01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:08.620
Happy now?

1064
01:15:23.427 --> 01:15:25.262
- Her things. The shoes.
- Help me.

1065
01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.222
Okay. pull.

1066
01:15:27.639 --> 01:15:28.307
A bit more.

1067
01:15:31.184 --> 01:15:32.728
Don't forget her things. Her shoes.

1068
01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.133
Careful.

1069
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:45.788
Come on.

1070
01:18:17.932 --> 01:18:19.099
Fix this.

1071
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:28.922
Papa!

1072
01:23:45.678 --> 01:23:46.846
Let me go.

1073

Let me go.

1076

Please! Please.

1077
01:24:02.779 --> 01:24:05.407
- Let me go!
- What are your friends' names?

1078
01:24:06.658 --> 01:24:10.370
What are your friends' real names?
Why aren't they registered here? Answer me!

1079
01:24:13.665 --> 01:24:14.787
Answer me!

1080
01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:16.876
It hurts. please stop!

1081
01:24:16.876 --> 01:24:17.836
Answer me!

1082
01:24:18.128 --> 01:24:19.365
Julius...

1083
01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.798
Francis...

1084
01:24:21.873 --> 01:24:23.467
