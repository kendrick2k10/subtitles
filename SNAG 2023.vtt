00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.394
Hello.

4
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.774
I don't usually get calls here.

5
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.317
I knew something was off.

6
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.445
Yes. Very thin…

7
00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.239
He is blonde with blue eyes.

8
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.699
He seems half dead?

9
00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:51.829
They usually stop here
on the way to the Grim Reaper.

10
00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:55.415
Yes…

11
00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:56.625
Boss.

12
00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.377
Whatever you say.

13
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.863
Fuck. lady!

14
00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:52.366
I'm Valentina Ventura De La Cruz-Santana.

15
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.410
I think you know very well who my mom is.

16
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:03.794
You touch this guy one more time -

17
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.587
and you're gonna get to know ME.
Understand?

18
00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:08.715
But your mom ordered us to kill him.

19
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.342
She just called.

20
00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.678
I don't think you understand. my son.

21
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.472
Do you see my mom here?

22
00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.515
No. right?

23
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.685
So I'm the one
making orders around here. bitch.

24
00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:21.853
Put your FUCKING gun away -

25
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.855
and nobody needs to get hurt.

26
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.232
Do you understand?

27
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.727
You like getting into fights --
huh. white boy?

28
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:21.981
Learn some Spanish

29
00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.316
you blue-eyed kangaroo.

30
00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.736
I don't wanna see you die.

31
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.551
White boy -- White boy.

32
00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.147
His head. His head.

33
00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.615
He's so heavy.

34
00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:41.783
Are you okay?

35
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.869
Yes daddy. Esteban.

36
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.508
It's like --- you know what --

37
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.146
Oh look. he's drooling.

38
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.941
Gross.

39
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.568
Poor baby.

40
00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:20.989
Good night. friend.

41
00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.370
Look at this place --

42
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.788
Gross. It smells disgusting.

43
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.123
So embarrassing.

44
00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.666
Let's go. Let's go.

45
00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:16.398
That's five gold teeth.

46
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:20.236
Learn to use dental floss.

47
00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:35.793
Your fate's looking more grim.

48
00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:39.630
This guy isn't much of a fighter. sweetie.

49
00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:42.758
I don't think this one will escape.

50
00:30:43.384 --> 00:30:45.094
And he definitely won't

51
00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:47.638
fall in love with
a beautiful Mexican girl.

52
00:30:48.264 --> 00:30:49.640
There's nobody like

53
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:50.975
The Thunder from Down Under

54
00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:52.434
right. sweetie?

55
00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:54.144
You're a hopeless romantic. son.

56
00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:55.646
But remember

57
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:58.023
that you could have been

58
00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:01.193
this poor bastard.

59
00:31:05.656 --> 00:31:07.074
You should be scared.

60
00:31:07.825 --> 00:31:09.618
You're at the very end

61
00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:12.204
of the longest. worst walk of your life.

62
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:16.709
Come along. lovers.

63
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.332
Hello.

64
00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:19.000
Fill it up please.

65
00:40:19.084 --> 00:40:19.960
Sure.

66
00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:43.163
Saturday…

67
00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:46.041
Nine -

68
00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:07.062
Where… this…

69
00:44:07.854 --> 00:44:09.147
the library?

70
00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:20.492
I love you.

71
00:44:21.451 --> 00:44:22.952
I love you.

72
00:44:29.793 --> 00:44:31.461
I have a secret.

73
00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:33.838
You have a secret?

74
00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:36.216
Which is…

75
00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:03.743
A book.

76
00:45:03.827 --> 00:45:04.661
My love.

77
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:05.870
To speak Spanish?

78
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:06.788
Seriously?

79
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.153
Protect --

80
00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:26.404
our legacy.

81
00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:29.550
This is the guy everybody's talking about?

82
00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:34.305
Want me to use a knife?

83
00:49:35.473 --> 00:49:36.683
Chill. brother.

84
00:50:01.374 --> 00:50:03.084
I don't know about that because…

85
00:59:00.913 --> 00:59:02.039
No. white boy.

86
00:59:02.122 --> 00:59:04.291
I know something's not right here.

87
01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.432
You look beautiful. my daughter.

88
01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:20.941
What are you doing here. mom?

89
01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:55.934
Mama. please.

90
01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:01.148
How does the saying go…

91
01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.775
The pride before the fall.

92
01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:30.055
White boy.

93
01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:33.975
Thank you

94
01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:35.727
for making me

95
01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:37.228
so happy.

96
01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:44.569
I love you.

97
01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:24.586
It's been

98
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:26.379
far too long.

99
01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:56.779
You are a cancer.

100
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.886
What happened?

101
01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.101
Please I'm begging you.

102
01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:29.062
Please don't make me do that.

103
01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.079
Who was it. mama?

104
01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:47.872
No one. sweetie.

105
01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.415
Just business.

106
01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:40.633
Good night.

107
01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:43.553
Good night. friend.

108
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.471
We're from two very different worlds

109
01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:27.388
white boy.
