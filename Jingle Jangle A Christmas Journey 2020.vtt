[tool hissing]

1763
01:42:45.833 --> 01:42:47.833
-Got it?
-Got it.

1764
01:42:48.958 --> 01:42:50.583
[Jessica mumbles]

1765
01:42:50.666 --> 01:42:52.708

-[Jeronicus] Had a little help.
-Mommy…

1770
01:43:04.166 --> 01:43:05.208
Hello. baby.

1771
01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:06.625
Had a lot of help.

1772
01:43:08.875 --> 01:43:10.041

1773

[all chuckling]

1774
01:43:14.041 --> 01:43:17.666
Now. all we have to do is turn Buddy on.

1775
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:20.458
[Journey sighs]

1776
01:43:31.791 --> 01:43:32.916
Okay.

1777
01:43:44.208 --> 01:43:45.333
I believe.

1778
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:48.625
Come on. Come on. Buddy.

1779
01:43:48.708 --> 01:43:51.125
I… believe.

1780
01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:53.250
[powering up]

1781
01:44:00.166 --> 01:44:01.708
[Buddy] Believe!

1782
01:44:02.458 --> 01:44:06.333
Just needed someone to believe.

1783
01:44:08.916 --> 01:44:09.750
Buddy?

1784
01:44:10.958 --> 01:44:12.625
[Buddy] Jeronicus!

1785
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:15.125

[Buddy] Alive. Yes!

1787
01:44:19.333 --> 01:44:20.666
Good to see you. Buddy.

1788
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:22.166
[Buddy laughing]

1789
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:25.916
[warm uplifting music playing]

1790
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.166
I'm glad you're here.

1791
01:44:27.916 --> 01:44:30.083
[Buddy] Glad to be here.

1792
01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:32.333
[loud knocking]

1793
01:44:33.208 --> 01:44:34.833
[man] Jeronicus Jangle!

1794
01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:39.875
Gustafson?

1795
01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:43.583
Well. hello. young lady.

1796
01:44:43.666 --> 01:44:45.708
-What is the meaning of this?
-Please!

1797
01:44:45.791 --> 01:44:48.083
The robot that you stole from me.

1798
01:44:48.666 --> 01:44:50.541
To the dungeon with him!

1799
01:44:51.125 --> 01:44:54.291
-Yes. you.
-I demand that you arrest him at once.

1800
01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:55.541
-Right now.
-For what?

1801
01:44:55.625 --> 01:44:56.833
You're the real thief.

1802
01:44:56.916 --> 01:44:59.541
A thief couldn't have these.

1803
01:44:59.625 --> 01:45:05.291
The designs
for the robot that I slaved over.

1804
01:45:05.375 --> 01:45:08.208
Restless days and sleepless nights.

1805
01:45:08.291 --> 01:45:11.250
I wanted to give up
so many times. but I didn't.

1806
01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:12.416
-I…
-[Don Juan] We.

1807
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.583
…persevered knowing that one day.

1808
01:45:14.666 --> 01:45:16.041
-I…
-We.

1809
01:45:18.625 --> 01:45:20.708
…would realize my dream.

1810
01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:23.833
Proof in black and white.

1811
01:45:26.041 --> 01:45:27.166
And blue.

1812
01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:28.916
¿Azul?

1813
01:45:33.458 --> 01:45:35.750
"Property of Jeronicus Jangle."

1814
01:45:37.541 --> 01:45:38.666
Explain this at once.

1815
01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:40.583
I don't… I…

1816
01:45:40.666 --> 01:45:42.791
-It's an easy explanation--
-I can explain.

1817
01:45:42.875 --> 01:45:44.541
After I ran into Mr. Gustafson.

1818
01:45:44.625 --> 01:45:47.250
I was afraid he would try
to steal The Buddy 3000.

1819
01:45:47.333 --> 01:45:49.166
so I marked the design.

1820
01:45:51.791 --> 01:45:53.041
For proof.

1821
01:45:54.041 --> 01:45:54.958
Uh-oh.

1822
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:57.625
Just arrest Mr. Jangle.

1823
01:45:57.708 --> 01:46:00.083
You told me those were your inventions.

1824
01:46:00.166 --> 01:46:01.375
Did you lie?

1825
01:46:01.458 --> 01:46:03.708
Are you a thief?

1826
01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:05.125
Yes. you.

1827
01:46:05.958 --> 01:46:08.416
Jeronicus. save me!

1828
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.958
[Jeronicus] I'll take the matador.

1829
01:46:10.958 --> 01:46:13.500
He's my invention after all.

1830
01:46:13.583 --> 01:46:14.750
I am home!

1831
01:46:14.833 --> 01:46:16.208
-What?
-[Don Juan] Mi rey…

1832
01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:19.083
I've missed you!

1833
01:46:19.166 --> 01:46:21.291
I like your hair.
Did you do that yourself?

1834
01:46:22.041 --> 01:46:23.041
Finally…

1835
01:46:23.125 --> 01:46:26.625
-children everywhere will love you.
-[Don Juan] I am extremely lovable.

1836
01:46:26.708 --> 01:46:30.208
[chuckles] Puppy-dog eyes.
Baby kitten eyes.

1837
01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:37.625
-After I reprogram you.
-Reprogram? Reprogram what?

1838
01:46:37.708 --> 01:46:42.041
I am and forever will remain
one and only one of a kind!

1839
01:46:42.125 --> 01:46:43.375
[powering down]

1840
01:46:45.583 --> 01:46:48.041
[constable] We've got the wrong guy.
Come on.

1841
01:46:48.125 --> 01:46:49.375
Why are you here. sir?

1842
01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:51.041
This doesn't make sense.

1843
01:46:51.125 --> 01:46:53.458
You will take the word
of a ten-year-old child?

1844
01:46:53.541 --> 01:46:56.083
I'm a respected member of the community!
Are you kidding?

1845
01:46:56.166 --> 01:46:57.500
Look at that child!

1846
01:46:57.583 --> 01:46:59.666
She has evil in her eyes! Don't you see?

1847
01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:01.250
How did you get on the force?

1848
01:47:01.333 --> 01:47:02.791
-You know--
-[Jeronicus] Wait.

1849
01:47:02.875 --> 01:47:04.291
I have something for him.

1850
01:47:13.541 --> 01:47:15.958
-I had it for you that night.
-[Gustafson] What?

1851
01:47:16.041 --> 01:47:17.833
But then you were gone.

1852
01:47:24.875 --> 01:47:26.375
[paper rustling]

1853
01:47:35.708 --> 01:47:37.666
A gyroscopic stabilizer.

1854
01:47:39.291 --> 01:47:41.125
For your Twirly Whirly.

1855
01:47:41.208 --> 01:47:43.375
I would have shown you everything…

1856
01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:45.875
if only you'd waited.

1857
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.083
I…

1858
01:47:49.791 --> 01:47:51.791
Come on. Move.

1859
01:47:56.458 --> 01:47:58.625
[Delacroix] Oh dear. oh dear. oh dear.

1860
01:47:59.583 --> 01:48:00.416

1861
01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.541
Merry Christmas. old friend. Ladies.

1862
01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:06.708
I'm sorry it's come to this.

1863
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:10.791
[whirring and whistling]

1864
01:48:10.875 --> 01:48:13.416
[gasps] What? What in heavens…?

1865
01:48:16.958 --> 01:48:18.916
It's something sensational.

1866
01:48:19.541 --> 01:48:22.833
-Yes!
-It's something spectacular!

1867
01:48:22.916 --> 01:48:24.083
More than that!

1868

1869
01:48:27.333 --> 01:48:30.541
-It's The Buddy 3000.
-The Bud… The what?

1871
01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:33.125
-[Jessica] It's a robot.
-Beg your pardon?

1872
01:48:33.208 --> 01:48:35.041
A flying robot.

1873
01:48:36.083 --> 01:48:38.666
-Is such a thing possible?
-Hmm.

1874
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:40.708
[Buddy] Something sensational.

1875
01:48:40.791 --> 01:48:42.458
Something spectacular.

1876
01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:45.000
Something revolutionary!

1877
01:48:45.083 --> 01:48:46.166
[Delacroix] It talks?

1878
01:48:46.791 --> 01:48:47.625
It talks.

1879
01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:49.166
It talks.

You talk.

1883
01:48:52.875 --> 01:48:54.083
[Buddy] I do.

1884

By Jove. Jeronicus. you've done it.

1885
01:48:57.833 --> 01:48:59.791
You are a genius. old friend.

1886
01:48:59.875 --> 01:49:01.541
-I wouldn't say that.
-Oh. no. no.

1887
01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:04.416
-If I know anything…
-Some people call me brilliant.

1888

Let go of what?

1903
01:49:45.291 --> 01:49:46.458
[Buddy laughing]

1904
01:49:47.958 --> 01:49:50.458
[Jeronicus chuckles] Oh!

[Jeronicus] I said the same thing!

1910
01:50:18.458 --> 01:50:21.083
Follow me. Buddy. Come on.

1911
01:50:21.166 --> 01:50:22.541

[grandmother] And everything that was
stolen from Jeronicus was returned to him.

1920

See them now?

You can see them. too?

[all chuckling]

1936

Why didn't you tell us before?

1937
01:51:57.708 --> 01:52:00.625
Well. I had to wait for the right moment.
