351
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.709
for this local jeweller

352
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.277
and she made mostly earrings and
broaches and stuff like that.

353
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:48.931
but...

354
00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:50.063
I started off
as a sales associate.

355
00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:51.760
She took me under her wing

356
00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:54.937
and really taught me
how to get my feet wet.

357
00:14:55.111 --> 00:14:56.983
I wouldn't have my own
place if it wasn't for her.

358
00:14:57.157 --> 00:14:58.506
I mean. I like to do
other stuff as well.

359
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.856
but. these rings.

360
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.511
they change people's lives.

361
00:15:03.685 --> 00:15:07.907
They can completely transform
relationships. you know?

362
00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:09.734
And there's just
something so special

363
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.955
about when the whole proposal
just goes so perfectly

364
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:15.044
and you know you played
a small part in it.

365
00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:19.962
I can imagine.

366
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:22.443
It's why I like to do
the one of a kind stuff.

367
00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:24.358
Each couple is unique.

368
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:27.970
So don't you think the rings
should be unique as well?

369
00:15:28.144 --> 00:15:29.493
I'm sorry. [laughing]

370
00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:31.017
I sound like
a commercial right now.

371
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:32.583
No. no.
I think it's beautiful. no.

372
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:34.934
So. what about you?

373
00:15:35.108 --> 00:15:37.371
How has life been
since you moved?

374
00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:40.852
Hm. well. it was
pretty rough in the beginning.

375
00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:42.376
- Really?
- Yeah.

376
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.030
I mean. I was so angry
at my parents

377
00:15:44.204 --> 00:15:45.292
I didn't talk to them for weeks.

378
00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:46.902
Yeah?

379
00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:49.383
Yeah. they moved me away
from all my friends.

380
00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:53.343
I thought you would move away
and forget all about us.

381
00:15:53.517 --> 00:15:55.302
- Where did you go again?
- Chicago.

382
00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:56.868
- I'm still there. actually.
- You like it?

383
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:58.479
Yeah. it's not bad.

384
00:15:58.653 --> 00:16:00.394
I mean. I definitely
didn't forget about

385
00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:02.874
all my friends back home.

386
00:16:03.049 --> 00:16:04.920
Did you forget about me?

387
00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:07.009
After you moved away
and broke my heart?

388
00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:10.882
No. of course not.
[laughing]

389
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.406
Why didn't you ever call?

390
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.973
Well. I figured
you went to high school.

391
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.365
you became a cheerleader.

392
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:16.932
you started dating
the quarterback.

393
00:16:17.106 --> 00:16:19.021
I definitely never dated
a football player.

394
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:20.370
- Not yet.
- [laughing]

395
00:16:20.544 --> 00:16:22.198
But after high school.

396
00:16:22.372 --> 00:16:24.026
You're dating a quarterback
right now. aren't you?

397
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.029
No. no football players. no.
No one for that matter.

398
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:30.250
Hm. well. there's nothing wrong
with the single life.

399
00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:33.253
I mean. I'm livin' it right now.

400
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:34.558
Yeah? No cheerleaders?

401
00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:36.996
- Hm. not at the moment.
- Oh.

402
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.262
[laughing]

403
00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.915
- So I wanted to--
- This might seem--

404
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.701
- Sorry.
- You go first.

405
00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:50.444
This may seem completely
out of the blue.

406
00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:53.360
and please feel free to say no.

407
00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:57.581
But. my sister Judy is having
a birthday party this weekend

408
00:16:57.755 --> 00:17:00.106
and I thought.
if you're still in town.

409
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.847
maybe you'd like to go with me.

410
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.415
Oh.

411
00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.375
You know what?
No pressure at all. really.

412
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.942
No. no. actually.
I'm in town 'til Sunday.

413
00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:12.988
so that could work perfectly.

414
00:17:13.162 --> 00:17:14.033
Yeah. that's. that's perfect.

415
00:17:14.207 --> 00:17:15.425
- Great.
- Great.

416
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.905
Great.

417
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.298
So what were you gonna say?

418
00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:20.126
Well. what brings me to town

419
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.911
is I'm actually here doing
some employment consulting.

420
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.870
Oh. you are employment
consulting here?

421
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.394
I am.

422
00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:30.092
You ever heard
of Shoreline Jewelers?

423
00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:32.225
Yeah. sure. they're
the mass-produced.

424
00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:34.183
soulless version
of Tokens of Love.

425
00:17:34.357 --> 00:17:37.491
Right. so they have. uh. they've
hired me to scout out this area

426
00:17:37.665 --> 00:17:39.536
to find someone
to run their new division.

427
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.582
It's gonna be focused on
the one of a kind market.

428
00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.498
Someone to oversee designers.
work with customers directly.

429
00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:47.501
and design unique rings.

430
00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:50.591
Basically what I do.
but bigger and nationwide.

431
00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:52.114
Exactly.

432
00:17:52.288 --> 00:17:54.334
Which is why I was going
to recommend you.

433
00:18:01.602 --> 00:18:05.606
Wait. So. he came
to offer you a job?

434
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.652
Apparently.
And for Shoreline Jewelers.

435
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:10.306
Which is bad?

436
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.439
Yeah. they're just.
they're so mass produced.

437
00:18:12.613 --> 00:18:14.571
It's like they churn out
these engagement rings

438
00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:18.358
Right! Which is bad?

439
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:21.274
He used to be so sensitive.

440
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:23.580
And now he's working
for Shoreline Jewelers.

441
00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.539
But he doesn't actually
work for them. right?

442
00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:26.931
They just hired him
as a head hunter.

443
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.542
A head hunter for them.

444
00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:32.023
Which is bad!

445
00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:34.025
Can you just take this
a little bit seriously?

446
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.462
What are you so worried about?

447
00:18:35.636 --> 00:18:37.116
You say
"Thanks. but. no. thanks."

448
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.595
and go your separate ways.

449
00:18:38.769 --> 00:18:40.467
I have not told you
the best part.

450
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:42.556
Oh. This should be good.

451
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.385
He told me all of this
after I invited him

452
00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:47.038
to Judy's birthday party.

453
00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:48.475
- What?
- And he accepted.

454
00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:50.346
- What?
- Yeah.

455
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.739
Woo. okay!

456
00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:54.133
So now.
you're bringing this dude

457
00:18:54.307 --> 00:18:56.091
that works for a company
that you hate.

458
00:18:56.265 --> 00:18:58.224
that came to town.
to offer you a job.

459
00:18:58.398 --> 00:19:00.313
to Judy's party?

460
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:02.141
- Yes.
- [laughing]

461
00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:04.099
- That's hilarious.
- No. no. no!

462
00:19:04.273 --> 00:19:05.231
What happened
to taking this seriously?

463
00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:07.233
Wait.

464
00:19:07.407 --> 00:19:09.583
And you did all of this to avoid
bringing some random guy that

465
00:19:09.757 --> 00:19:12.194
might turn out to be a disaster?

466
00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:13.630
Just. please...

467
00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:15.066
Why don't you just
un-invite him?

468
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:17.286
- No. I can't do that.
- Why not?

469
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.420
- Because it would be rude.
- So?

470
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:24.032
What?

471
00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:28.732
Kate Angela Sterling.
you like him.

472
00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:31.692
- No. I don't!
- Yes. you do!

473
00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:33.607
The only reason why
you're going through with this

474
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:38.220
is because you actually want
to spend more time with him.

475
00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:41.441
Yes. I enjoyed talking to him.

476
00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:44.095
And I would like to talk
to him again. but that's it.

477
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.794
- This is awesome.
- It doesn't even matter anyway.

478
00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:49.318
Because I'm gonna tell him
I don't want the job.

479
00:19:49.492 --> 00:19:52.103
He's gonna go back to Chicago
to his big fancy life.

480
00:19:52.278 --> 00:19:53.888
and we're never gonna
see each other again.

481
00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:56.499
I can solve this problem.
This is what you should do.

482
00:19:56.673 --> 00:19:58.327
What?

483
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:00.373
Pretend like you're thinking
about taking the job.

484
00:20:00.547 --> 00:20:02.244
What?

485
00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:03.637
You'll have to talk to him
a few more times.

486
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:05.247
Maybe get dinner.

487
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:07.554
No. no. no.
I'm not gonna do that.

488
00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:10.209
Fine. but I don't wanna hear
about it when he's on that plane

489
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:11.819
back to Chicago.

490
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:15.301
[breathing angrily]

491
00:20:15.475 --> 00:20:16.911
Hey. Patricia.

492
00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:18.652
Yeah. things are going
really great here.

493
00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:20.523
I'm actually right about
to meet up with her again.

494
00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:22.177
I think she might
really be interested.

495
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:23.918
Right.

496
00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:25.572
Okay. well. I'll keep you
updated on how it goes.

497
00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:27.269
but I'm feeling optimistic.

498
00:20:28.444 --> 00:20:29.837
Go enjoy your party.

499
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:32.448
No. I want to see
what he looks like now.

500
00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:35.190
He basically
looks the same. just taller.

501
00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:37.018
He's probably
not even gonna come.

502
00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:40.239
Okay. Miss Negativity.
You look amazing. by the way.

503
00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:41.979
Trying to impress someone?

504
00:20:42.153 --> 00:20:45.418
I am going to go mingle.
If he shows up. then fine.

505
00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:48.464
Oh. my God.
There he is.

506
00:20:50.336 --> 00:20:52.729
Oh. he's way cuter
than I remember.

507
00:20:52.903 --> 00:20:55.645
- Stop staring.
- He really grew into his ears.

508
00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:57.691
- Judy!
- What?

509
00:20:57.865 --> 00:21:00.520
Oh. just pretend I
said something really funny.

510
00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:02.348
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

511
00:21:02.522 --> 00:21:07.527
[both laughing]

512
00:21:10.617 --> 00:21:12.140
- Thank you.
- Judy.

513
00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:14.534
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.

514
00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:16.144
Oh. you didn't
have to get me anything.

515
00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:17.624
Come on.

516
00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:19.626
You haven't seen me
for 19 years.

517
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.541
You let me invade your party?
I had to get you something.

518
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:23.194
Except I don't know
what you like.

519
00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:25.414
So my cousin runs
this amazing restaurant in town.

520
00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:26.894
and I thought
you and Ben could go out there

521
00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.330
for dinner sometime.

522
00:21:28.504 --> 00:21:30.114
That's so thoughtful.
Thank you.

523
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.202

00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:34.496
No one.

873
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.585
Kate Sterling. were you up all
night on the phone with a boy?

874
00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:38.196
That is none of your business.

875
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.067
No. you have been
acting weird for too long.

876
00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:41.590
Tell me who you were talkin' to.

877
00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:43.244
- No.
- I'm gonna get it out of you.

878
00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:45.072
- I got all day.

Hey!

880
00:36:46.856 --> 00:36:49.598
Cynth. what are you doing here?

881
00:36:49.772 --> 00:36:52.558
I was just in the neighbourhood.
I thought I'd come by.

882
00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:56.692
- Kate: Oh. look at you.
- Cynthia: Oh. I know.

883
00:36:56.866 --> 00:36:58.433
- Anthony: Come get a seat.
- I'm massive.

884
00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:02.350
No. you look amazing.
So how much longer?

885
00:37:02.524 --> 00:37:05.614
- Two weeks.
- That is so soon!

886
00:37:05.788 --> 00:37:08.617
Yeah. she is a rock star.
I'm freakin' out.

887
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:10.489
Aw. he's amazing.

888
00:37:10.663 --> 00:37:11.968
He was practising putting

889
00:37:12.142 --> 00:37:12.795
a diaper on a cantaloupe
the other day.

890
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:14.884
Really?

891
00:37:15.058 --> 00:37:16.103
Well. I'm not gonna wait until
there's a baby in front of me

892
00:37:16.277 --> 00:37:17.583
to learn.

893
00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:20.107
Mm. see?
You're gonna make a great dad.

894
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:22.152
If I don't die of anxiety
before that.

895
00:37:22.327 --> 00:37:24.154
Shouldn't you be the one
with the anxiety

896
00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:26.809
You'd think. [laughing]

897
00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:28.768
I can't wait
to meet the new baby.

898
00:37:28.942 --> 00:37:30.770
You gonna have
to come by here all the time.

899
00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:32.685
Isn't that gonna be
a bit distracting?

900
00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:34.469
Are you kidding?
A new family member?

901
00:37:34.643 --> 00:37:37.864
I know Vicki said that
she would babysit anytime.

902
00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:41.389
I would also like to offer that.

903
00:37:41.563 --> 00:37:44.262
This store
is really something special.

904
00:37:44.436 --> 00:37:46.176
I don't think Anthony's
clicked with his coworkers

905
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:47.395
like he has here.

906
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:50.137
Well. it's all thanks to Kate.

907
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:51.791
The feeling is mutual.

908
00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:54.750
I don't know what we'd
do without you or Vicki.

909
00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:56.883
But I have some stuff
to take care of in the back.

910
00:37:57.057 --> 00:37:59.842
- So--
- Hang on!

911
00:38:00.016 --> 00:38:01.496
You're not gettin' out of
our conversation that easy.

912
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.498
What conversation?

913
00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:07.197
Oh. Kate was just up all night
on the phone with some guy.

914
00:38:07.372 --> 00:38:10.288
- It was not all night.
- Cynthia: Really?

915
00:38:10.462 --> 00:38:12.246
- Is he cute?
- Yeah. what's his name?

916
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.727
His name is Jamie.

917
00:38:14.901 --> 00:38:16.685
Oh. wait.
This is that guy?

918
00:38:16.859 --> 00:38:18.470
Yes. it's that guy.

919
00:38:18.644 --> 00:38:21.560
Okay. wait. wait.
Who's "that guy"?

920
00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:23.910
Well. that guy is
her first boyfriend.

921
00:38:24.084 --> 00:38:26.304
That is so sweet.

922
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:28.393
I haven't seen him in 19 years.

923
00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:30.308
And he just came by to catch up?

924
00:38:30.482 --> 00:38:32.440
Well. he actually
he came into town for work.

925
00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:35.748
But then we ended up
hitting it off.

926
00:38:35.922 --> 00:38:37.402
Wait. wait.
Um. he came for work?

927
00:38:37.576 --> 00:38:39.317
You didn't say it was for work.

928
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:40.361
Okay. you promise
you won't freak out?

929
00:38:40.535 --> 00:38:43.321
No.

930
00:38:43.495 --> 00:38:46.454
He works as a hiring consultant
for Shoreline Jewelers.

931
00:38:46.628 --> 00:38:47.760
What?

932
00:38:47.934 --> 00:38:49.631
Is that bad?

933
00:38:49.805 --> 00:38:53.635
Shoreline Jewelers is the worst.
What did he want?

934
00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:55.855
It doesn't even matter.
because I said "No."

935
00:38:56.029 --> 00:38:57.291
So they made you an offer then?

936
00:38:57.465 --> 00:38:59.032
No. not officially.

937
00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:01.426
They're opening up
a new custom orders division

938
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.905
and they wanted me to run it.

939
00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:06.300
- And you said "No?"
- I-I'm going to.

940
00:39:06.474 --> 00:39:09.347
You should at least
hear them out.

941
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:10.478
- What?
- You think so?

942
00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:12.393
Wow. My own wife.

943
00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:15.831
Babe. it doesn't necessarily
have to be a bad thing.

944
00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:20.270
How would Kate not being here
be a good thing?

945
00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:22.011
I would still own
Tokens of Love.

946
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:24.362
I just wouldn't be around
for the day-to-day stuff.

947
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:25.450
Yeah. See?

948
00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:27.800
Yeah.
See?

949
00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:30.846
Would it really be so bad
if someone had to take over

950
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.328
as the manager?

951
00:39:34.502 --> 00:39:36.635
Well. when you put it that way.

952
00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:38.593
Exactly.

953
00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:40.726
At the very least. I'd like
to know what they're up to.

954
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.510
Just in case
we run into competition.

955
00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:44.512
- Okay. but just
promise me that you're--

00:39:44.686 --> 00:39:46.209
- [phone buzzing and ringing]
- not gonna get sucked into...

guess where I am right now.

959
00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:51.389
- Kate: Where?
- You know. a phone call or...

960
00:39:51.563 --> 00:39:52.564
Jamie: Turn around.

961
00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:56.698
- [gasping]
- Surprise.

962
00:39:56.872 --> 00:39:59.614
Oh! What are you doing here?

963
00:39:59.788 --> 00:40:01.703
Well. I told Shoreline

964
00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:04.271
that you're actually really
interested in taking the job.

965
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:07.274
They really want you
to come on board.

966
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:08.797
They want you
to come back to Chicago

967
00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:10.495
to have a little chat
with corporate.

968
00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:12.845
You flew all the way here
just to tell me that?

969
00:40:13.019 --> 00:40:14.760
I could've done it
over the phone.

970
00:40:14.934 --> 00:40:17.284
But I convinced them that
the personal touch was better.

971
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:19.852
and I wanted to see you.

972
00:40:20.026 --> 00:40:22.550
- How long are you here for?
- A couple days.

973
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:25.858

Oh. well. that's amazing.

978

You can come here and hang out
while he's workin'?

979
00:40:35.215 --> 00:40:36.825
Yeah. Kate's always had
an open-door policy

980

We're a small operation.

983

that a personal touch

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.120
Oh. she's in the back
doin' inventory.

1212
00:52:03.294 --> 00:52:05.165
- Uh. Vicki!
- Vicki: Yeah?

1213
00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:08.516
Our fearless leader is here
with reinforcements.

1214
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.128
- Vicki: What?
- Reinforcements.

1215
00:52:11.302 --> 00:52:12.477
Oh. you didn't have to do that.

1216
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:14.043
What's that?

1217
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:16.002
I started working
on some sketches.

1218
00:52:16.176 --> 00:52:17.569
- Like you said.
- That's amazing.

1219
00:52:17.743 --> 00:52:19.397
They're just some rough ideas.

1220
00:52:19.571 --> 00:52:20.963
but maybe you could tell me
if I'm on the right track.

1221
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:22.487
I would love to.

1222
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.402
Is it okay if I do this
in a little bit?

1223
00:52:24.576 --> 00:52:26.447
Sure. No problem.

1224
00:52:26.621 --> 00:52:28.710
There's something I'd like to
talk to the two of you about.

1225
00:52:28.884 --> 00:52:31.974
- Yes?
- It's not a big deal.

1226
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.455
But?

1227
00:52:34.629 --> 00:52:37.154
Next week. I'm gonna
go to Chicago to see

1228
00:52:37.328 --> 00:52:38.720
the Shoreline Jewelers
headquarters.

1229
00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:40.592
What? As a spy?

1230
00:52:40.766 --> 00:52:43.421
As a guest.

1231
00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:46.728
I decided I'm just
gonna hear their offer.

1232
00:52:46.902 --> 00:52:48.426
I thought you were
turning them down.

1233
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.254
Well. I still might.

1234
00:52:50.428 --> 00:52:52.081
I just... I thought it can't
hurt to hear them out.

1235
00:52:52.256 --> 00:52:53.692
You're serious?

1236
00:52:53.866 --> 00:52:56.216
I know.
I know you guys are worried.

1237
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:57.739
But I promise I'm not
gonna make any decisions

1238
00:52:57.913 --> 00:53:00.089
without talking
to the both of you first.

1239
00:53:00.264 --> 00:53:01.743
I thought you started this place

1240
00:53:01.917 --> 00:53:03.310
so you wouldn't have
to work at a big company.

1241
00:53:03.484 --> 00:53:05.182
You were the one
who talked about

1242
00:53:05.356 --> 00:53:08.097
how awful Shoreline Jewelers is.

1243
00:53:08.272 --> 00:53:10.317
We made fun of them.

1244
00:53:10.491 --> 00:53:12.232
I just. I wanna keep an open
mind.

1245
00:53:12.406 --> 00:53:15.104
Wow. okay.
Well. fine.

1246
00:53:15.279 --> 00:53:19.021
- Anthony?
- No.

1247
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.632
You know what?

1248
00:53:20.806 --> 00:53:22.373
I'm gonna take an early lunch

1249
00:53:22.547 --> 00:53:25.593
'cause I'm not really
in the mood for bagels.

1250
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:28.901
Fine. [sighing]

1251
00:53:30.294 --> 00:53:31.338
I'm sorry.

1252
00:53:31.512 --> 00:53:35.168
- He'll calm down.
- Maybe.

1253
00:53:35.342 --> 00:53:36.822
So...

1254
00:53:40.652 --> 00:53:42.349
Your sketches! Right!

1255
00:53:42.523 --> 00:53:44.308
You don't have to look at them
today if you're too busy.

1256
00:53:44.482 --> 00:53:46.310
No! I really want to.

1257
00:53:46.484 --> 00:53:48.225
Can you leave this with me and
I'll take a look in a little bit

1258
00:53:48.399 --> 00:53:49.487
and I'll let you know
what I think?

1259
00:53:49.661 --> 00:53:51.402
Great. Thanks.

1260
00:53:51.576 --> 00:53:53.708
Okay.

1261
00:53:53.882 --> 00:53:57.277
Well. I should probably
get back to inventory.

1262
00:54:04.763 --> 00:54:09.681
♪

1263
00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:23.042
♪

1264
00:54:29.962 --> 00:54:31.485
So. everything okay
at the hotel?

1265
00:54:31.659 --> 00:54:33.792
Yeah. the hotel is great.
Thank you.

1266
00:54:33.966 --> 00:54:35.620
I'm glad you could
sneak away for lunch.

1267
00:54:35.794 --> 00:54:37.448
Well. you are in for a treat.

1268
00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:39.450
because I'm taking you
to my favourite lunch spot.

1269
00:54:39.624 --> 00:54:40.886
Ooh. sounds good.

1270
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:45.673
Kate: So. burgers.

1271
00:54:45.847 --> 00:54:47.719
I thought you were
all about gourmet.

1272
00:54:47.893 --> 00:54:50.112
Sure. but good food
is good food.

1273
00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:51.810
And trust me.

1274
00:54:51.984 --> 00:54:54.203
This is the best burger
you will ever taste.

1275
00:54:54.378 --> 00:54:56.336
- It's the best burger?
- Yes.

1276
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.470
Like the best ravioli
and the best cannoli?

1277
00:54:59.644 --> 00:55:02.516
[both laughing]

1278
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.345
- Well. they are the best.
- I'm just teasing.

1279
00:55:07.782 --> 00:55:08.827
So. you excited
to see headquarters?

1280
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:10.307
I am.

1281
00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:11.482
It's just
an office building. right?

1282
00:55:11.656 --> 00:55:13.353
Actually. it's really big.

1283
00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:15.399
There's a gym and a cafeteria
right in the building.

1284
00:55:15.573 --> 00:55:17.009
Oh. wow.

1285
00:55:17.183 --> 00:55:18.576
I wish we had
a parking lot at my store.

1286
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.229
And you know what?
The cafeteria isn't bad.

1287
00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:23.494
On Wednesdays
they serve the best tacos.

1288
00:55:23.668 --> 00:55:25.539
Well. if they're the best.

1289
00:55:25.713 --> 00:55:28.194
that's great. because then you
could come have lunch with me.

1290
00:55:28.368 --> 00:55:32.720
- On Wednesdays definitely.
- [laughing]

1291
00:55:32.894 --> 00:55:34.418
Do you think
I'm gonna get my own office?

1292
00:55:34.592 --> 00:55:36.463
Or am I gonna be stuck
in a cubicle?

1293
00:55:36.637 --> 00:55:39.248
Someone as important as you?
Definitely an office.

1294
00:55:39.423 --> 00:55:41.599
- Oh.
- Ooh. here it comes.

1295
00:55:41.773 --> 00:55:43.688
Oh. wow.

1296
00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:45.429
Both: Thank you.

1297
00:55:48.388 --> 00:55:49.563
- Whew!
- Okay. come on.

1298
00:55:49.737 --> 00:55:50.869
- Have a bite.
- Okay. okay.

1299
00:55:54.786 --> 00:55:57.963
- Mm!
- Well?

1300
00:56:00.008 --> 00:56:02.576
That is definitely the best
burger I have ever tasted.

1301
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.230
- I know. right?
- How do they do that?

1302
00:56:04.404 --> 00:56:05.710
I have no idea.

1303
00:56:05.884 --> 00:56:06.885
I've been comin' here
for three years.

1304
00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:08.626
They won't give me their secret.

1305
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.236
I tried to reproduce it
at home. but no luck.

1306
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:11.542
Which means there's
only one explanation.

1307
00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:13.282
- What's that?
- It's magic.

1308
00:56:13.457 --> 00:56:14.458
The chef's a wizard.

1309
00:56:14.632 --> 00:56:18.331
[laughing] That must be it.

1310
00:56:18.505 --> 00:56:19.941
Okay. so chalk one up
for Chicago.

1311
00:56:20.115 --> 00:56:21.813
- Best burger in the world.
- Best burger.

1312
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:24.990
I'm not sure that that's
the criteria I'm looking at.

1313
00:56:25.164 --> 00:56:27.906
- But. it's a good start.
- Okay. fair enough.

1314
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.343
So. is there something swaying
you one way or the other?

1315
00:56:30.517 --> 00:56:32.998
Well. there is someone
that I would be excited

1316
00:56:33.172 --> 00:56:34.869
to get to spend
some more time with.

1317
00:56:35.043 --> 00:56:37.045
Who is he?
Is it a guy?

1318
00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:40.353
Yeah. Doug. I met him. you know.
on the plane ride over here.

1319
00:56:40.527 --> 00:56:42.311
- Doug. huh?
- [laughing] No!

1320
00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:44.923
- You.
- [laughing]

1321
00:56:45.097 --> 00:56:48.013
- Okay. we have the burger.
- Mm-hm.

1322
00:56:48.187 --> 00:56:49.623
We have the tacos.

1323
00:56:49.797 --> 00:56:51.712
There's an incredible
job opportunity.

1324
00:56:51.886 --> 00:56:55.412
You're here.
What am I missing?

1325
00:56:55.586 --> 00:56:58.371
What is there
that Chicago has to offer me?

1326
00:56:58.545 --> 00:56:59.938
And not the touristy stuff.

1327
00:57:00.112 --> 00:57:01.548
I'm talking about.
like. the real deal.

1328
00:57:01.722 --> 00:57:03.463
What would
your perfect day look like?

1329
00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:06.466
- Am I not enough?
- [laughing] I told you.

1330
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.382
You're very high up on the list.

1331
00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:11.515
- Okay. so the perfect day?
- Yeah.

1332
00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:13.517
Okay. I would start by taking
you to this little coffee shop

1333
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:15.127
that I go to.

1334
00:57:15.301 --> 00:57:17.564
They have the best--
Really good lattes.

1335
00:57:17.738 --> 00:57:22.308
And. then I would go
for a walk along the water

1336
00:57:22.482 --> 00:57:23.396
if the weather's nice.

1337
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:25.137
Okay.

1338
00:57:25.311 --> 00:57:26.312
And then grab the paper
and do the crossword.

1339
00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:28.488
Crossword? Wow.

1340
00:57:28.662 --> 00:57:30.359
So are you a bit of a word nerd?

1341
00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:31.926
Well. there's a lot about me
you don't know yet.

1342
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.015
Oh. okay.

1343
00:57:34.189 --> 00:57:35.887
But after that. we'd go to the
farmer's market near my place.

1344
00:57:36.061 --> 00:57:37.584
grab a few things. and I'd
improvise us a little dinner

1345
00:57:37.758 --> 00:57:39.020
based on what they had.

1346
00:57:39.194 --> 00:57:40.805
That sounds pretty great.
actually.

1347
00:57:40.979 --> 00:57:44.765
And then if it's Sunday.
we'll watch the Bears game.

1348
00:57:44.939 --> 00:57:49.030
I will never be a Bears fan.

1349
00:57:49.204 --> 00:57:53.557
- We'll get you there.
- Go. Vikings.

1350
00:57:56.037 --> 00:57:59.780
Well. I'd wish you luck.
but I don't think you need it.

1351
00:57:59.954 --> 00:58:02.000
- You're not coming in?
- Hey. I got you here.

1352
00:58:02.174 --> 00:58:03.784
My job is done.

1353
00:58:03.958 --> 00:58:07.092
I gotta meet a client
in about an hour or so.

1354
00:58:07.266 --> 00:58:08.833
So I'll be with you in spirit.

1355
00:58:09.007 --> 00:58:11.749
- Okay.
- Call me when you're done.

1356
00:58:11.923 --> 00:58:13.272
I will.

1357
00:58:19.278 --> 00:58:20.627
Vicki: You don't actually think

1358
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:22.107
she's going to
take the job. do you?

1359
00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:23.935
Of course she's
gonna take the job.

1360
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:27.025
She's gonna abandon us
and work her way up to CEO.

1361
00:58:27.199 --> 00:58:30.594
and wear pant suits.
and buy a yacht.

1362
00:58:30.768 --> 00:58:34.423
I actually wanna know
what you think.

1363
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:36.556
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1364
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:38.602
I don't know.
She's Kate. you know?

1365
00:58:38.776 --> 00:58:41.518
She visited my mother
in the hospital.

1366
00:58:41.692 --> 00:58:44.651
She baked my wife
cupcakes for her birthday.

1367
00:58:44.825 --> 00:58:46.523
So she's gonna stay?

1368
00:58:46.697 --> 00:58:49.482
She also started her own
business single-handedly.

1369
00:58:49.656 --> 00:58:51.789
I mean. she's hardworking.
She's ambitious.

1370
00:58:51.963 --> 00:58:56.533
- There's no denying that.
- So she's gonna leave.

1371
00:58:56.707 --> 00:58:59.361
Well. she's... she's gonna
have a big decision

1372
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:00.580
on her hands either way.

1373
00:59:07.979 --> 00:59:09.850
- Excuse me?
- Hey there.

1374
00:59:10.024 --> 00:59:11.504
Can I help you find something?

1375
00:59:11.678 --> 00:59:13.593
Yeah. I'm looking
for Patricia Long.

1376
00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:15.464
Patty's office
is just down there.

1377
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:18.467
Although. she could be anywhere.

1378
00:59:18.642 --> 00:59:20.861
Oh. I think she's expecting me.

1379
00:59:21.035 --> 00:59:23.647
Wait. are you here about
that custom design project?

1380
00:59:23.821 --> 00:59:25.257
Yeah. Yeah. that's right.

1381
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.824
- I'm Kate Sterling.
- Great to meet you.

1382
00:59:26.998 --> 00:59:28.565
I'm Dan.

1383
00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:29.957
You must have really
impressed the higher-ups.

1384
00:59:30.131 --> 00:59:31.524
Everyone's really
excited about it.

1385
00:59:31.698 --> 00:59:32.917
- Really?
- Oh. yeah.

1386
00:59:33.091 --> 00:59:34.701
Everyone's been
talking about it.

1387
00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:37.574
No pressure though.

1388
00:59:37.748 --> 00:59:39.184
This seems like
a great place to work.

1389
00:59:39.358 --> 00:59:41.012
- You like it here?
- I love it.

1390
00:59:41.186 --> 00:59:42.666
Listen. Don't get me wrong.

1391
00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.319
It's fast-paced.

1392
00:59:44.493 --> 00:59:46.104
You have to work hard
to try and keep up.

1393
00:59:46.278 --> 00:59:47.671
Don't expect
to go home at 5:00.

1394
00:59:47.845 --> 00:59:50.543
But. if you stick it out.
put in the time.

1395
00:59:50.717 --> 00:59:51.718
there's a lot of potential here.

1396
00:59:51.892 --> 00:59:53.546
That's good to know. Thank you.

1397
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.505
Actually. if you have
some free time later.

1398
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.942
I'd love to get your thoughts

1399
00:59:58.116 --> 00:59:59.639
on a new ring line
I'm sketching.

1400
00:59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.554
- Yeah. of course.
- Patricia: [laughing]

1401
01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:03.730
Oh. she just
walked through the door.

1402
01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:05.863
- Give her a minute to breathe.
- Dan: Sorry. Patty.

1403
01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:07.429
Kate. I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

1404
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:08.822
No. of course not!

1405
01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.128
I hope Dan wasn't
scaring you off.

1406
01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:12.130
No. he was not.

1407
01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:13.827
Dan: I was just welcoming her
to the family.

1408
01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.655
Great.
Well. I'm glad to hear that.

1409
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:17.918
Maybe later this afternoon.
you two could chat again?

1410
01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:19.485
- I would love that.
- Dan: I'd be happy to.

1411
01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:20.921
Wonderful.

1412
01:00:21.095 --> 01:00:22.183
So. Kate.
we can chat in my office.

1413
01:00:22.357 --> 01:00:23.358
- Kate: Okay.
- Come on.

1414
01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:26.666
I hope he didn't
come on too strong.

1415
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.668
No. not at all.

1416
01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:32.237
[laughing] Dan is very. very
passionate about his job.

1417
01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:34.500
Everyone here is.

1418
01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:36.894
Yeah. I'm starting
to get that impression.

1419
01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:39.026
That's one reason I think
you'll fit right in.

1420
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.594
Oh. well. thank you.
I hope so.

1421
01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:45.076
Based on what Jamie
has told us about you.

1422
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.512
I have no doubts.

1423
01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:47.556
- This is me.
- Okay.

1424
01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.297
Vicki: I don't know why.

1425
01:00:49.471 --> 01:00:50.168
I have this weird feeling
that she's gonna leave.

1426
01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:52.605
Yeah. me too.

1427
01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:54.607
What are we gonna do
if she takes the job?

1428
01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:57.001
Well. we're gonna stick around
here and keep this place goin'

1429
01:00:57.175 --> 01:00:58.263
as best as we can.

1430
01:00:58.437 --> 01:00:59.873
It won't be the same.

1431
01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.309
Nah. we're
pretty capable people. right?

1432
01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:03.137
I mean. I'm probably
the best salesman

1433
01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:06.097
in the known universe.
and you have your...talents.

1434
01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:08.229
[Anthony laughing]

1435
01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:11.668
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1436
01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:15.933
You know I think that
you're an extremely talented.

1437
01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:18.892
promising. capable.
young salesperson. right?

1438
01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:20.764
Really?

1439
01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:23.680
Which is why it wounds me
so deeply that you would just

1440
01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:25.812
cast that all aside
to become a designer.

1441
01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:28.597
[laughing] Well. you're just
gonna have to deal with me

1442
01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.208
being a double threat.

1443
01:01:30.382 --> 01:01:32.906
Touché.

1444
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.953
[phone ringing]

1445
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:37.998
- Hello?
- Cynthia: [screaming] My God!

1446
01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:39.565
- The baby's coming!
- Anthony: Oh. okay!

1447
01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:40.653
Okay. okay.
I'm comin' right now!

1448
01:01:40.827 --> 01:01:42.220
I'm comin' right now!

1449
01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:44.657
Uh. uh. Cynthia
just went into labour.

1450
01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:45.745
[gasping]
You're having a baby!

1451
01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:47.616
I'm having a baby!

1452
01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:50.750
- [both screaming and cheering]
- I'm having a baby!

1453
01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:52.143
- You're having a baby!
- I gotta go!

1454
01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:55.624
I gotta go!
[grunting]

1455
01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.670
Okay.
That's what we're doing.

1456
01:01:57.844 --> 01:01:59.411
All right.

1457
01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:05.243
I forgot my phone!
I forgot my phone!

1458
01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:06.766
- Oh!
- I need my phone!

1459
01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.115
- You need a phone.
- Thank you!

1460
01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:09.508
Bye!

1461
01:02:13.207 --> 01:02:16.558
[Patricia clearing throat]

1462
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.996
So. Kate. I just want you

1463
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:21.085
to understand
that I did not ask you here

1464
01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:23.217
to sell you
on Shoreline Jewelers.

1465
01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:25.002
Okay.

1466
01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:27.221
I brought you here so that
you could see the place.

1467
01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:30.137
get a feel for it.
and decide for yourself

1468
01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:31.835
if this is right for you.

1469
01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:34.185
- That sounds great.
- Trust me.

1470
01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:38.232
Everyone here wants you
to be completely comfortable.

1471
01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:41.279
So. ask me anything.

1472
01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:43.324
[sighing] Okay.

1473
01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:48.242
- Um. how big is this place?
- Do you mean square footage?

1474
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:50.897
No. how many. um. how many
employees do you have?

1475
01:02:51.071 --> 01:02:54.683
Five hundred or so in total.
but not everyone works here...

1476
01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.207
- Wow.
- ..at headquarters.

1477
01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.775
Look. why don't
we take a walk around?

1478
01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:00.211
I can show you more of the place

1479
01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:02.082
and introduce you
to some people?

1480
01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:04.215
- That sounds great.
- All right. great.

1481
01:03:04.389 --> 01:03:07.131
- This is Kate.
- Hello. hi. nice to meet you.

1482
01:03:07.305 --> 01:03:08.785
Kate: Do you know everyone?

1483
01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:10.221
Patricia:
We work in teams every day.

1484
01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:12.223
so no one gets lost
in the crowd.

1485
01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:15.400
- Is it always this busy?
- We work hard.

1486
01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:16.923
But we have our fair share

1487
01:03:17.097 --> 01:03:20.100
of birthdays and
weekend get-togethers.

1488
01:03:20.274 --> 01:03:22.668
- Yep. workin' super hard.
- He...look at this.

1489
01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:25.366
Would I have to work
in one of those cubicles?

1490
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.238
Patricia: You would
have your own office.

1491
01:03:27.412 --> 01:03:28.630
but you would spend
a good deal of time

1492
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.328
out meeting with clients.

1493
01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:33.113
You could make your own hours
for the most part

1494
01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:36.813
and have 10 or so designers
working under you.

1495
01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:41.818
Wow. that really is
a big opportunity.

1496
01:03:41.992 --> 01:03:44.124
- Patricia: Anything.
- Kate: It's you.

1497
01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:46.387
- Okay. well. good to meet you.
- [Patricia laughing]

1498
01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:53.830
- So. Kate. I'm sorry.
- What?

1499
01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:55.962
Those meatballs
were a bit saucy.

1500
01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.921
- It wasn't my best work.
- They were delicious.

1501
01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.400
No. I... I...

1502
01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:01.054
The polenta was amazing as well.

1503
01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:02.795
I am actually pretty proud
of the polenta.

1504
01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:04.318
[laughing] It was good.

1505
01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:05.885
I gotta get
serious for a minute.

1506
01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:07.844
You haven't talked about
the job all night.

1507
01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:09.454
You've been quiet about it.
How'd it go?

1508
01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:11.369
It was good. It was good.

1509
01:04:11.543 --> 01:04:12.805
- Yeah?
- For the most part.

1510
01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:14.546
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1511
01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.462
- I would get my own office.
- Oh. that's cool.

1512
01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:18.942
I have my own office now.

1513
01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:22.815
but somehow there
it feels more important.

1514
01:04:22.989 --> 01:04:26.340
Okay. so you've got some pros.
What are the cons?

1515
01:04:26.514 --> 01:04:29.778
It's big.
It's really big.

1516
01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:31.650
I'm sure.

1517
01:04:31.824 --> 01:04:33.478
There's no way I would be able
to learn everyone's name.

1518
01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:36.133
It'd be a transition.

1519
01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:40.137
It's so fast-paced and busy.

1520
01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:42.182
Tokens of Love. it's hard.

1521
01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:45.359
but we're nowhere near
that level of intensity.

1522
01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:47.927
Well. that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

1523
01:04:48.101 --> 01:04:49.929
Sometimes a fast-paced
environment can be good.

1524
01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:54.151
That's true. but I'd miss those
moments in between customers

1525
01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.327
with Anthony and Vicki.

1526
01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:59.243
It would sort of feel like
I'm losing part of my family.

1527
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:00.853
You wouldn't be losing them.

1528
01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:03.029
But you wouldn't
be able to see them as much.

1529
01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:06.163
It'll be tough to move.
I've lived there my whole life.

1530
01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:08.382
My family is there.
My friends are there.

1531
01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:12.778
Okay. so. try not
to think of it

1532
01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:14.649
like you're losing a family.

1533
01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:18.827
Try to think of it like
you're gaining a work family.

1534
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:21.874
And you can keep in touch with
all the people you care about.

1535
01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:25.878
- Yep. everyone was really nice.
- See?

1536
01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:27.793
And they were
completely sold on me

1537
01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:29.316
from the minute I walked in.

1538
01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.144
I'm assuming
that was your doing.

1539
01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:32.798
My doing?

1540
01:05:32.972 --> 01:05:34.974
Yes.

1541
01:05:35.148 --> 01:05:37.846
I run a small jewelry store
hundreds of miles away.

1542
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:40.893
No one would've known about me
if it wasn't for you.

1543
01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:42.416
So that's what you think?

1544
01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:43.852
It's okay.
I'm not insecure about it.

1545
01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:45.854
But it's true. isn't it?

1546
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:48.335
Kate. Shoreline Jewelers gave me
a list of people to scout out

1547
01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.207
and your name was on it.

1548
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:51.382
I didn't even know
you owned a jewelry shop

1549
01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:52.861
until I saw that.

1550
01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.689
- Really?
- Yeah.

1551
01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:56.300
It's not like I just saw
your name and stopped looking.

1552
01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:58.911
No. I'm good at my job.
I did my research.

1553
01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:02.436
And you are legitimately
the best person for that job.

1554
01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:04.830
Thank you.

1555
01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:08.094
Kate. I'm not trying
to get you to take this job

1556
01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:10.575
just so you can come here
and spend more time with me.

1557
01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:12.229
Even though
that would be amazing.

1558
01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:15.884
I mean. don't get me wrong.
It's a nice perk.

1559
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.712
More than anything.

1560
01:06:17.886 --> 01:06:20.802
I really think that
this is the best move for you

1561
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.588
for your career.

1562
01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:27.635
It's an amazing opportunity.
You are so talented.

1563
01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:30.073
And I really think you need
to share that with the world.

1564
01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:35.513
I appreciate that. I do.

1565
01:06:37.515 --> 01:06:41.432

about what I'd be losing.

1567

Yeah. yeah. well.
that's a challenge.

But I'm also starting to see
what I would be missing

1572

if I don't take the job.

1573

- You.

- I'm glad I made the list.
- You are the list.

1575
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:17.163
I don't wanna leave tomorrow.

1576
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:24.344
To be honest. I don't
want you to leave either.

1577
01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:27.043
I'll miss you.

1578

What's most important
is what you think.

Every time I think
about moving here I get excited.

1583

It's new people.
new possibilities.

1584
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.104

I would regret it

around and help me get a place?

So what are you gonna do?

1880

Well. I've already
done something.

1881
01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:53.326
- I quit my job.
- Are you serious?

1882
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:57.504
- Yep. two days ago.
- I didn't ask you to do that.

1883
01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:04.903
I didn't do it for you.
But I did do it because of you.

1884
01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:06.470
I mean. you inspired me.
Look at you.

1885
01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:10.822
You worked so hard
to own your own business.

another shot. Kate.

I'm gonna open in Minneapolis.

You're gonna open
a restaurant here?

Yeah. it's my hometown.
It's where I grew up.

give me a another chance.

you don't have to come to me.
