3
00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.027
Shit.

4
00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:55.860
Shit.

5
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.329
I'm disappointed in you. Dean.

6
00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.429
And after everything
we've been through today.

7
00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:13.529
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:18.661
It's too late to apologise.

9
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.362
Look. I've got money
if you want it.

10
00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:25.495
I have money.

11
00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:29.429
Why the fuck are you doing this?

12
00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:48.795
If you really need to ask why.

13
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.229
then you haven't learned
anything today have you?

14
00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:23.295
11 seconds.

15
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.329
Not bad.

16
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:36.195
Assailant

17
00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:00.362
Do you see that.

18
00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:02.471
He can't even get through a
session with a marriage counsellor

19
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:03.894
without checking that thing.

20
00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:08.028
How are we ever supposed
to fix this?

21
00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:10.395
Jason?

22
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:13.760
What can I see.

23
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.300
She is so paranoid about
my work that

24
00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:19.695
well. she already think I'm more
interested in that than I am in her.

25
00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:20.794
And are you?

26
00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.827
Am I what?

27
00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:27.095
More interested in your
work than you are in Zoe.

28
00:04:29.262 --> 00:04:32.760
Okay. The fact you Eve have to think
about it tells me that I'm right.

29
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.195
And I swear to god. if you call me
paranoid one more time. I will lose...

30
00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:37.827
You'll what?

31
00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:40.927
Because somebody has to pay the bills
and keep the roof over our head.

32
00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:43.062
You don't get it Zoe.

33
00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:45.760
I'm at work all the time
for you. not for me.

34
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.794
No. It's you that
doesn't get it.

35
00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:51.727
All I'm asking
for is more time together.

36
00:04:51.827 --> 00:04:53.727
More time with you.

37
00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:57.128
Balancing our life and my own
goals isn't exactly easy. you know.

38
00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.162
But we used to have
our goals together.

39
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:10.395
I just want that back.

40
00:05:16.494 --> 00:05:18.062
Zoe. please let's
talk about this.

41
00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:19.695
We've been talking
for an entire hour.

42
00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.727
You know what I want.
so either try that or...

43
00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:23.827
Or what?
Hold on a second. please.

44
00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:35.760
Look.

45
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.461
We're damaged right now
and that is all my fault.

46
00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:41.995
I'm gonna fix this.

47
00:05:43.794 --> 00:05:46.195
Let's get away.

48
00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:49.794
Really?

49
00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:52.661
Let's go back to the Caribbean.

50
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.938
Remember after
I proposed to you there

51
00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:58.028
we watched that couple sail
by on that yacht.

52
00:05:58.128 --> 00:06:01.394
Yeah. We used to say
that would be us in ten years.

53
00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.128
Well. let's be that couple now.

54
00:06:04.628 --> 00:06:07.595
Do you honestly mean this?

55
00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:12.794
Please Zoe. give me one more shot.
Let me make this right.

56
00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:17.329
Okay.

57
00:06:22.062 --> 00:06:23.995
But on one condition.

58
00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:25.195
Anything.

59
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.461
No work phone.

60
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.995
At all.

61
00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:36.461
No work phone.

62
00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:39.028
Promise?

63
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.461
You have my word.

64
00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:22.661
Hey. wait up. Wait up.

65
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.295
You don't even know
where you're going.

66
00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:26.194
I don't need you to tell me
where we're going.

67
00:07:36.795 --> 00:07:39.628
Oh. come on.

68
00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:42.727
You're not still annoyed about the
flight attendant thing. are you?

69
00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:44.071
You didn't have to be so
stubborn about it. though.

70
00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:46.727
and hold up everyone getting
off the plane.

71
00:07:46.828 --> 00:07:47.494
It was embarrassing.

72
00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:49.595
I said sorry.

73
00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:50.695
Yeah. But not to me.

74
00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:54.370
Why do you always
have to be like that?

75
00:07:54.394 --> 00:07:56.028
Like what?

76
00:07:57.661 --> 00:08:00.727
Is that some sort of dig about
our old failed business again?

77
00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:03.128
Because look. I
screwed up. okay?

78
00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:06.361
Are you gonna hold it against
me for the rest of our lives?

79
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:11.294
You put all of our company's savings
into a bad investment behind my back.

80
00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:14.394
I'd call that a little bit
more than just screwing up.

81
00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:18.528
Taxi?

82
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:21.028
Yeah. Alright buddy.

83
00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:23.171
And clearly we're in the
middle of something here. okay?

84
00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:24.761
Sorry. My bad.

85
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:26.695
See what I mean.

86
00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:28.728
There's no need for that.

87
00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.795
Thanks for apologising.
It means so much to me.

88
00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:34.028
And yes. we'll take your taxi.

89
00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:35.494
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

90
00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:40.995
Great start.

91
00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:45.195
<i>In other news. the body of Dean.</i>

98
00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:05.489
Unless he's got himself a boat.
I think we're gonna be perfectly fine.

99
00:09:07.028 --> 00:09:08.294
Not if I kill you first.

100
00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:09.394
Hmm?

101
00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:12.062
Nothing.

102
00:09:39.494 --> 00:09:40.595
Thanks.

103
00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:51.628
You okay?

104
00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:55.294
Yeah. Just taking it all in.
I've missed this.

105
00:09:56.194 --> 00:09:58.228
Missed what?

106
00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:01.194
Never mind. You get out
a lot more than I do these days.

107
00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:09.328
There's our guy. Come on.

108
00:10:15.161 --> 00:10:18.194
Hi there. Welcome.
You must be Jason.

109
00:10:21.494 --> 00:10:23.494
I am. You must be our captain.

110
00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:25.696
That's right.
How was your flight?

111
00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:29.328
Oh. Not exactly smooth sailing.

112
00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.428
Oh.

113
00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:34.062
- Hello there.
- Hi.

114
00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:36.962
Zoe. this is our
captain for the trip.

115
00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:38.261
Yeah. Just call me Henry.

116
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:40.394
Lovely to meet you. Henry.

117
00:10:40.494 --> 00:10:42.038
Henry was just saying that
he lined up our permits

118
00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:43.596
for the island hike tomorrow.

119
00:10:43.696 --> 00:10:45.294
Oh. permits?

120
00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.071
Yeah. Well. it's a damn shame
what happened on that island.

121
00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:50.161
All the tourism just damn dried
up in the last couple of years.

122
00:10:50.261 --> 00:10:51.404
but they still wanna
look after the historical sites.

123
00:10:51.428 --> 00:10:54.696
so anybody who goes over
there. well. you need a permit.

124
00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:57.528
But not to worry.
I got you all lined up.

125
00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:01.161
Makes sense. Nothing's quite
what it used to be. I guess.

126
00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:05.103
Well you guys must
love a challenge

127
00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:07.494
'cause you picked one hell
of a hike to start off with.

128
00:11:07.596 --> 00:11:10.528
Yeah. Well. we used to operate
a tour guide business together.

129
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:11.629
You did? How about that.

130
00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:14.696
What happened to it?

131
00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:18.194
Life.

132
00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:19.728
I got you. Got you.

133
00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:22.294
The trail is kinda
special to us. though.

134
00:11:22.394 --> 00:11:24.170
I proposed to Zoe at the end
of it about ten years ago

135
00:11:24.194 --> 00:11:27.094
at the hotel right
on the water there.

136
00:11:27.194 --> 00:11:30.061
I'm sorry to say that hotel
is abandoned now.

137
00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:32.094
but it's still a beautiful spot.

138
00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:34.771
Well. what do you say
we get on our way?

139
00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:35.962
Thank you.

140
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:38.494
Yeah. Oh. but the way guys.
I hope you don't mind

141
00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:42.529
but I took the Liberty of making a
reservation for you at a nice restaurant

142
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:45.461
a couple of islands over.
Very romantic.

143
00:11:46.928 --> 00:11:48.629
Sounds great.

144
00:11:57.127 --> 00:12:00.596
Look. I'm sorry about the thing
on the plane.

145
00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:05.562
And the thing in the taxi.

146
00:12:05.662 --> 00:12:08.328
Okay. But...

147
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:13.461
Fresh slate. starting right now.

148
00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:17.161
There's still love behind
that moody face of yours.

149
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.261
I can see it.

150
00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:23.995
Well. stop making me moody and
I'll stop giving you that face.

151
00:12:26.094 --> 00:12:27.127
Deal.

152
00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:03.328
To us.

153
00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:13.027
What are you up to?

154
00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:16.696
Just thinking.

155
00:13:18.294 --> 00:13:20.294
Admiring Henry's
lifestyle actually.

156
00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:23.429
He's got it pretty
good. for sure.

157
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:29.061
I used to think
this would be us by now.

158
00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:32.067
And it will be soon enough.

159
00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:35.061
once I put in a few more years.

160
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:36.994
get a promotion.

161
00:13:37.094 --> 00:13:39.127
Well. the world will literally
be our oyster.

162
00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:45.061
The world already is.

163
00:13:53.961 --> 00:13:55.328
I'll get us some more.

164
00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:25.094
You're a lucky man. Jason.

165
00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:27.994
Thanks.

166
00:14:28.094 --> 00:14:30.261
Come out here to try
to remind myself of that.

167
00:14:31.127 --> 00:14:33.761
I thought I'd remind you. too.

168
00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:35.141
I know it's none of my business.

169
00:14:35.228 --> 00:14:39.927
but I do recognize a make
or break holiday when I see one.

170
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:43.429
Get a lot of them
out here. do you?

171
00:14:44.795 --> 00:14:46.495
More than our share. I'm afraid.

172
00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:50.462
I've had more than my share
of divorces. too.

173
00:14:52.027 --> 00:14:54.328
Sorry to hear that.

174
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:56.570
What happened?

175
00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:02.261
Let's just say I learned a little
too late what life is all about.

176
00:15:02.362 --> 00:15:04.161
How lucky I really was.

177
00:15:06.728 --> 00:15:09.495
You know. my advice to you?

178
00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.395
I'd have those next two glasses
of champagne down in the bedroom.

179
00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:17.828
I'll just pop on my headphones
and crank up some country music

180
00:15:17.927 --> 00:15:21.860
and keep my eyes on the horizon.

181
00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:22.961
You're a wise man. Henry.

182
00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:27.827
Yeah. I'm a wise man.

183
00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:53.194
Can you put it
over there. please?

184
00:15:55.027 --> 00:15:56.061
Okay.

185
00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:31.362
Sorry. I thought
I'd turned that off.

186
00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:36.629
Well. honestly. it's fine.
Did you wanna...

187
00:16:36.728 --> 00:16:39.061
It's my sister.

188
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:40.401
I'll give you two some privacy.

189
00:16:40.429 --> 00:16:43.462
You can just meet me at the bar
when you're done.

190
00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:44.562
Okay.

191
00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:48.760
Hi. Everything okay?

192
00:16:52.462 --> 00:16:54.961
Can you just hang on one second.

193
00:16:56.462 --> 00:16:57.827
You're not working are you?

194
00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.061
Just 'cause you did promise
you'd leave that stuff at home.

195
00:17:04.696 --> 00:17:06.462
Just getting my wallet.

196
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.103
So. I'll see you
in about an hour.

197
00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:13.961
Great.

198
00:17:15.696 --> 00:17:17.395
Hi.

199
00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.094
Yeah. Jason just
went to the bar.

200
00:17:21.794 --> 00:17:22.994
Honestly?

201
00:17:23.662 --> 00:17:26.329
I have absolutely no idea.

202
00:17:45.662 --> 00:17:47.695
Hey. What can I get for you?

203
00:17:49.061 --> 00:17:53.195
Something strong. You pick.

204
00:18:10.094 --> 00:18:11.094
Hey.

205
00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:15.596
This isn't what I ordered.

206
00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:19.827
I asked for a lime and soda.
not whatever the fuck this is.

207
00:18:19.927 --> 00:18:21.429
Okay. I'll change it.

208
00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:26.047
You should apologise to her.

209
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:31.961
What?

210
00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:41.094
That was your first strike.

211
00:18:41.195 --> 00:18:44.462
You got two more.
Apologise to her.

212
00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:50.104
Look man. I don't know
who you think you are.

213
00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:52.994
Last chance. Apologise now.

214
00:19:00.128 --> 00:19:03.395
Okay man. sure.
Whatever you say.

215
00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:06.128
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to speak to you like that.

216
00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:08.927
Good.

217
00:19:10.628 --> 00:19:12.462
The original drink
will do just fine.

218
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:16.395
Tell her now.

219
00:19:16.495 --> 00:19:19.061
You know what? Don't worry
about changing out that drink.

220
00:19:35.562 --> 00:19:38.395
Fair play. That guy deserved it.

221
00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:43.462
I meet a lot of people
like that. sadly.

222
00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:51.162
On vacation?

223
00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:55.195
Literally just started.

224
00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:00.927
Don't tell my wife
I'm working. though?

225
00:20:02.727 --> 00:20:04.028
Wouldn't dream of it.

226
00:20:10.628 --> 00:20:12.927
Hope it's a good holiday
for you and...

227
00:20:14.095 --> 00:20:15.927
Zoe.

228
00:20:17.395 --> 00:20:19.628
She's heading down here
for dinner in a little while.

229
00:20:19.727 --> 00:20:21.229
Just getting ready now.

230
00:20:32.195 --> 00:20:35.295
I'm Jason. by the way.
Jason sellers.

231
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.860
Michael.

232
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.095
Michael?

233
00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:45.429
Just Michael.

234
00:20:48.162 --> 00:20:50.760
Okay. Michael.

235
00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:04.262
You remind me of someone.

236
00:21:07.827 --> 00:21:10.494
Oh yeah? Who's that?

237
00:21:12.494 --> 00:21:13.494
Not sure.

238
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.028
So. you're not sure
who I remind you of.

239
00:21:21.128 --> 00:21:23.362
That's a little bit weird?

240
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.095
Sorry. It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

241
00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:34.595
Been moving around.
Got a new boat.

242
00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:37.995
You know what? We're actually
travelling around in a yacht.

243
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:41.794
You sail.

244
00:21:41.894 --> 00:21:44.595
No. No. Me and the wife
can't sail to save our lives.

245
00:21:44.695 --> 00:21:49.062
but we've got a captain
so it's all good on that front.

246
00:21:49.162 --> 00:21:52.195
Jealous. Wish I could join you.

247
00:21:56.429 --> 00:21:59.827
Well. you could join me for a
drink right now if you want.

248
00:22:03.362 --> 00:22:04.494
Sure.

249
00:22:06.727 --> 00:22:07.628
Henry.

250
00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:08.928
Yeah.

251
00:22:09.028 --> 00:22:11.628
You know the restaurant. right?

252
00:22:11.727 --> 00:22:12.760
Yeah.

253
00:22:14.962 --> 00:22:18.095
Are you asking this old man
for a little fashion advice?

254
00:22:19.295 --> 00:22:20.461
Pretty much.

255
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:24.895
I just can't decide whether I
should dress up or go casual.

256
00:22:24.995 --> 00:22:26.128
Let's see here.

257
00:22:28.295 --> 00:22:31.095
Well. I've always found that
a little effort goes a long way.

258
00:22:33.494 --> 00:22:35.661
- Yes.
- Thanks.

259
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.794
By the way. how do I get there?

260
00:22:37.895 --> 00:22:38.962
Oh. don't worry about that.

261
00:22:39.062 --> 00:22:40.437
When you're ready to go
I'll take you ashore.

262
00:22:40.461 --> 00:22:41.461
You can't miss it.

263
00:22:44.128 --> 00:22:46.062
I hope you don't
mind me saying this

264
00:22:46.162 --> 00:22:49.062
but I agree with your friend
on the phone.

265
00:22:51.628 --> 00:22:55.861
That was my sister and were you
listening to our conversation?

266
00:22:55.962 --> 00:22:57.229
No. no.

267
00:22:58.628 --> 00:23:00.794
Calm seas carry loud voices

268
00:23:01.628 --> 00:23:02.995
and I do agree with her.

269
00:23:04.528 --> 00:23:05.528
About what?

270
00:23:08.361 --> 00:23:10.760
If you want these things
to stand the test of time.

271
00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:12.528
that's exactly
what you have to give them.

272
00:23:12.628 --> 00:23:13.995
Time.

273
00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:18.394
So. take a little advice
from an old fool for love.

274
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:23.928
You go on your hike tomorrow
and well. who knows?

275
00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:26.561
By the time you get to the end
of the trail

276
00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:28.428
maybe that spark is still there.

277
00:23:59.128 --> 00:24:02.661
Hi. We've got
a table booked here tonight.

278
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.528
What's the name?

279
00:24:03.628 --> 00:24:05.328
I think it's in my
husband's. Jason.

280
00:24:05.428 --> 00:24:08.195
Oh yeah. We've added
the extra place already.

281
00:24:08.295 --> 00:24:09.295
Extra place?

282
00:24:40.294 --> 00:24:41.695
Yeah. So. basically

283
00:24:41.795 --> 00:24:44.962
my boss is getting pushed out for
sure after messing up like that

284
00:24:45.062 --> 00:24:46.795
and I know I'm the next in line.

285
00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:48.128
There is literally nobody

286
00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:50.995
who puts those kinda hours
in at that place like me.

287
00:24:53.962 --> 00:24:56.294
Zoe. You made it.

288
00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:57.394
Sure did.

289
00:25:01.162 --> 00:25:05.428
Sorry. This is Michael.
Michael. this is my other half.

290
00:25:05.528 --> 00:25:08.128
It's really nice
to meet you. Zoe.

291
00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:16.294
You are wonderful.

292
00:25:19.229 --> 00:25:22.494
Thanks for saying.
It's nice to meet you. too.

293
00:25:25.361 --> 00:25:27.428
Me and Michael
were just chatting at the bar.

294
00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:30.294
Turns out he's sailing
around the island. just like us.

295
00:25:31.494 --> 00:25:34.461
Well. not quite like you guys.

296
00:25:34.561 --> 00:25:39.195
I'm in a tiny boat on my own. so
it's nowhere near as romantic.

297
00:25:39.294 --> 00:25:44.162
Yeah. Well. Jason is certainly
full of romance. aren't you?

298
00:25:51.428 --> 00:25:55.294
You know what? I'm real sorry to
intrude on your meal like this.

299
00:25:55.394 --> 00:25:58.062
I'm gonna let you two
have your evening together.

300
00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:03.028
Oh. it's okay. Join us. please.

301
00:26:03.761 --> 00:26:04.761
Yeah. It'll be fun.

302
00:26:08.062 --> 00:26:12.162
Okay. Well that's really
kind of you both.

303
00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:17.928
Let's get you a drink.

304
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:24.095
Sounds great.

305
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:36.995
Wait. Michael.
where's your glass?

306
00:26:37.861 --> 00:26:39.194
None for me. thanks.

307
00:26:40.728 --> 00:26:42.161
Not much of a drinker. are you?

308
00:26:44.128 --> 00:26:45.828
You got me.

309
00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:48.928
I mean. we probably shouldn't drink
much more considering the hike tomorrow.

310
00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:56.062
We could always
just push it back.

311
00:26:56.161 --> 00:27:00.161
Really? What about the day
permits Henry's arranged? Come on.

312
00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:03.795
No. You guys are gonna
have a real experience tomorrow.

313
00:27:03.895 --> 00:27:05.228
You can't miss out on that.

314
00:27:07.728 --> 00:27:09.494
To new beginnings.

315
00:27:12.895 --> 00:27:13.895
I would choose to that.

316
00:27:17.294 --> 00:27:20.194
So. what is it you
do again. Michael?

317
00:27:21.795 --> 00:27:24.095
He's a teacher.

318
00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:26.728
I prefer educator.

319
00:27:26.828 --> 00:27:28.062
What do you teach?

320
00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:33.328
I see myself as a life coach.

321
00:27:33.428 --> 00:27:38.995
Okay. But what I'm asking is what
do you specifically coach people in?

322
00:27:40.094 --> 00:27:42.228
You know the kind of stuff.

323
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:44.928
No. I don't really know
what kind of stuff.

324
00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:47.662
I mean. I'd love to
know more. though.

325
00:27:49.194 --> 00:27:50.538
You don't wanna talk
about work tonight.

326
00:27:50.562 --> 00:27:55.228
We came to the Caribbean to get
away from that. right Jason?

327
00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:02.294
Okay. I was just asking
what your job was.

328
00:28:02.394 --> 00:28:04.928
No harm in finding out
it's a bit bore. It's...

329
00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:08.394
Zoe. He doesn't
wanna talk about it.

330
00:28:10.795 --> 00:28:13.461
Okay. No problem.

331
00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:20.028
You know. Jason.
that's who it is.

332
00:28:22.696 --> 00:28:23.761
Who what is?

333
00:28:26.361 --> 00:28:27.361
Who you remind me of.

334
00:28:29.662 --> 00:28:30.662
It's a younger me.

335
00:28:33.861 --> 00:28:35.261
Is that a good thing?

336
00:28:35.728 --> 00:28:37.394
Not really.

337
00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:45.394
Well. thanks pal.
I love you. too.

338
00:28:45.962 --> 00:28:48.061
Hey. wait a minute.

339
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:52.428
Jason reminds you of you and you
don't wanna talk about your job.

340
00:28:54.061 --> 00:28:55.662
What's your deal. Michael?

341
00:28:55.761 --> 00:28:57.428
Okay. That's enough.

342
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:58.871
You know. I actually
didn't catch your second name.

343
00:28:58.895 --> 00:29:00.394
Jesus Christ. Zoe.

344
00:29:00.495 --> 00:29:02.962
Will you stop grilling the
man with all of your question?

345
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:05.629
Don't talk to me like that.

346
00:29:05.728 --> 00:29:07.495
Well then. just leave it. okay?

347
00:29:16.994 --> 00:29:18.795
Apologise to Zoe now.

348
00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:24.495
You know what?
I think we should probably go.

349
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.428
No-one is going anywhere
until he apologises to you.

350
00:29:30.861 --> 00:29:31.981
What did you just say to me?

351
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:37.861
I'm only gonna tell you
three times. Jason.

352
00:29:37.962 --> 00:29:39.428
That's it.
This is your second time.

353
00:29:41.294 --> 00:29:43.127
Apologise to Zoe now.

354
00:29:43.228 --> 00:29:44.962
I'm sorry.
but who do you think you are?

355
00:29:45.061 --> 00:29:46.328
I don't need you to tell me

356
00:29:46.428 --> 00:29:49.394
what I can and cannot let my
own husband get away with.

357
00:29:49.495 --> 00:29:52.761
I'm only gonna tell you
to stay out of this three times.

358
00:29:52.861 --> 00:29:54.529
That was your first time.

359
00:29:55.895 --> 00:29:57.070
Don't talk to my wife that way.
I'll kick your ass.

360
00:29:57.094 --> 00:29:58.605
Please Jason. just
leave it. Is that it?

361
00:29:58.629 --> 00:30:01.861
I don't know where you get off
talking to people like that

362
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:05.294
but if I was you. I would
walk away while I still could.

363
00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:15.027
Last chance is coming up. Jason.

364
00:30:16.127 --> 00:30:18.294
Think about this very carefully.

365
00:30:24.795 --> 00:30:29.429
Alright. alright.
That's enough. Break it up.

366
00:30:29.529 --> 00:30:32.895
Hey. he started it. man.
The guys got a screw loose or something.

367
00:30:33.361 --> 00:30:34.562
You gotta go.

368
00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:06.728
This is the final time
I'll ask you. apologise.

369
00:31:10.696 --> 00:31:11.728
You're crazy. man.

370
00:31:35.127 --> 00:31:36.429
Zo. wait up.

371
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:38.970
No chance. I just wanna get back
to the boat as quick as we can.

372
00:31:38.994 --> 00:31:40.596
Listen. listen. listen.

373
00:31:40.696 --> 00:31:45.429
It's over now. so can we just
take a minute and. and breathe?

374
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:50.027
Did you see what that guy did
to the doorman?

375
00:31:50.127 --> 00:31:51.371
If you're not as
scared as I am then

376
00:31:51.395 --> 00:31:52.970
maybe there's something wrong
with your head too.

377
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.994
Oh come on.
you're just being para...

378
00:31:55.094 --> 00:31:59.061
Don't you dare say it.
Just don't. ok?

379
00:32:01.194 --> 00:32:05.562
Am I really that bad that you just
can't have dinner. the two of us?

380
00:32:05.662 --> 00:32:06.761
I'm so sorry. Zoe.

381
00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:10.596
I really am.

382
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:15.728
Can we please just go to bed.
I am done with today.

383
00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:20.629
Oh. shit.

384
00:32:20.728 --> 00:32:22.395
What?

385
00:32:24.228 --> 00:32:25.438
I must have left my
wallet at the bar.

386
00:32:25.462 --> 00:32:26.462
You're joking?

387
00:32:26.495 --> 00:32:27.894
I'm not. But I'll just go and...

388
00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:30.329
No. no. you're not.

389
00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:34.362
We'll cancel the cards and we'll
just use mine until we get home.

390
00:32:34.462 --> 00:32:36.894
- Zoe. that's ridiculous.
- Jason. no.

391
00:32:36.994 --> 00:32:38.261
You're not going back there.

392
00:32:39.728 --> 00:32:41.061
If you do. I'm going.

393
00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:44.761
Going where?

394
00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.728
Home. As in home. home.

395
00:32:51.061 --> 00:32:55.228
Ok. Ok. then we'll leave it.
Whatever you want.

396
00:32:57.161 --> 00:33:00.395
What I want is to get back
on the boat.

397
00:33:08.495 --> 00:33:09.495
Sure.

398
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.195
Hey. good morning sunshine.

399
00:35:09.094 --> 00:35:11.128
Feeling better after
a little sleep?

400
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.695
What sleep?

401
00:35:12.794 --> 00:35:14.462
Oh. come on now.

402
00:35:14.562 --> 00:35:17.362
It's gonna be a beautiful day and
maybe that'll make up for everything.

403
00:35:19.629 --> 00:35:20.629
Maybe.

404
00:35:35.562 --> 00:35:37.229
Good morning. Henry.

405
00:35:37.329 --> 00:35:38.329
Morning. Jason.

406
00:35:41.362 --> 00:35:43.429
At least the weather's
on our side today.

407
00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:44.529
Yeah.

408
00:35:46.128 --> 00:35:48.329
But this isn't the Caribbean.

409
00:35:48.429 --> 00:35:51.128
Weather tends to change
minute to minute around here.

410
00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:56.229
But I don't think any storms
are headed your way just now.

411
00:35:56.727 --> 00:35:58.727
Thank god for that.

412
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:01.760
I think last night was
about the only storm

413
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.860
we could handle right now.

414
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:07.162
Yeah. it is a scary thing.
thinking someone can hurt you?

415
00:36:09.562 --> 00:36:12.002
But you know I think in the long
run. it's all gonna work out.

416
00:36:13.661 --> 00:36:15.760
I hope so.

417
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.562
she still cares enough about you that
she doesn't wanna see you get hurt.

418
00:36:46.894 --> 00:36:52.162
We should be there in about 30
minutes or so. are you all packed? Zo?

419
00:36:54.894 --> 00:36:56.927
I think that boat
is following us.

420
00:36:57.661 --> 00:37:00.528
Wait. you don't think it's...

421
00:37:00.628 --> 00:37:01.628
Could be.

422
00:37:02.927 --> 00:37:04.128
I highly doubt it.

423
00:37:04.229 --> 00:37:05.229
What if it's him?

424
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.495
It's a fisherman. zo.

425
00:37:07.595 --> 00:37:09.095
You never take me seriously.

426
00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:11.295
Yes I do.

427
00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:13.661
I just don't think someone
would follow us out here

428
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.362
because of a stupid bar fight.

429
00:37:15.462 --> 00:37:17.295
I don't care what you think.

430
00:37:17.395 --> 00:37:19.195
That guy scared the life out
of me last night.

431
00:37:22.162 --> 00:37:24.095
Look. I'll prove it to you.

432
00:37:24.462 --> 00:37:26.128
Hey. Henry.

433
00:37:29.395 --> 00:37:30.395
Yeah?

434
00:37:31.229 --> 00:37:33.162
You ever seen that boat before?

435
00:37:34.162 --> 00:37:36.827
Oh yeah. that's Dean levin.
local fisherman.

436
00:37:38.095 --> 00:37:40.095
Bit of a pain in the ass.
but harmless. why?

437
00:37:41.295 --> 00:37:42.295
No reason.

438
00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:45.329
See? Nothing to worry about.

439
00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:20.429
Woo.

440
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:24.062
Alrighty. you got those permits?

441
00:38:24.162 --> 00:38:25.195
Yep.

442
00:38:25.295 --> 00:38:27.437
I guess there's not much
I can tell you about that trail

443
00:38:27.461 --> 00:38:28.561
you don't already know.

444
00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:30.504
No. sir. we probably
know that trail better than you.

445
00:38:30.528 --> 00:38:31.962
I bet you do.

446
00:38:32.062 --> 00:38:33.437
Alright. I'll take the boat
the other side of the island.

447
00:38:33.461 --> 00:38:34.461
I'll meet you over there.

448
00:38:35.162 --> 00:38:36.162
Alright.

449
00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:44.995
Zoe.

450
00:38:48.528 --> 00:38:50.628
Thanks. Henry. Enjoy your day.

451
00:38:50.727 --> 00:38:52.295
You're welcome and I will.

452
00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:54.727
I'm gonna go back there. crank
up some rock and roll music.

453
00:38:54.827 --> 00:38:57.362
pop a couple of beers
and have a good old time.

454
00:38:57.461 --> 00:38:58.461
I'll see you later.

455
00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:26.827
You're not still worried
about that boat. are you?

456
00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:30.095
Amongst other things.

457
00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:33.628
- Do you wanna enlighten me?
- Not really.

458
00:39:33.727 --> 00:39:37.128
So. we're just gonna do the whole
trail like this then. are we?

459
00:39:37.229 --> 00:39:39.928
Because it was supposed
to be romantic.

460
00:39:40.028 --> 00:39:43.028
Yeah. so was dinner last night.

461
00:39:43.128 --> 00:39:46.528
- Fair enough. zo. I get it.
- Do you?

462
00:39:46.628 --> 00:39:48.928
You still haven't
even apologised yet.

463
00:39:49.028 --> 00:39:50.708
I was getting my ass kicked
by some lunatic

464
00:39:50.794 --> 00:39:53.062
and you want me to apologise?

465
00:39:53.162 --> 00:39:54.428
You know what? Just forget it.

466
00:39:54.528 --> 00:39:56.928
I don't even know why i'm
bothering to try and save this.

467
00:39:57.028 --> 00:39:59.095
Save what? Or marriage you mean?

468
00:39:59.195 --> 00:40:01.062
Because that's what you do. Zoe.

469
00:40:01.162 --> 00:40:02.571
It's still death do
us part. remember?

470
00:40:02.595 --> 00:40:05.262
Yeah. well. maybe I don't think
it's such a good idea anymore.

471
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.095
Stop.

472
00:40:10.595 --> 00:40:12.962
You're not talking about
getting a divorce. are you?

473
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:19.262
Zoe. talk to me.

474
00:40:21.295 --> 00:40:23.162
Please tell me that's not
who I think it is.

475
00:40:27.095 --> 00:40:29.494
No way. Why would
he bother following us?

476
00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:30.795
Seriously?

477
00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:33.095
How many true crime docs
do we have to watch?

478
00:40:34.995 --> 00:40:38.628
It's just some other hiker doing
the same trail that we are.

479
00:40:38.727 --> 00:40:40.394
Well. I'm not hanging
around to find out.

480
00:40:43.595 --> 00:40:47.628
Zoe. Look. you can't just dangle
the d word on me and then take off

481
00:40:47.727 --> 00:40:48.229
because of some other hiker.

482
00:40:48.328 --> 00:40:50.128
Try me.

483
00:41:16.494 --> 00:41:19.461
Ok. that's enough.
will you please just talk to me?

484
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:20.661
Nope. No thank you.

485
00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:23.461
Zoe. stop. I'm serious.

486
00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:27.062
This is not exactly the best place
to be having this conversation.

487
00:41:27.162 --> 00:41:29.202
Let's just get off this island
and then we can talk.

488
00:41:31.962 --> 00:41:33.162
Are you leaving me?

489
00:41:34.727 --> 00:41:35.727
Not right now. I'm not.

490
00:41:36.695 --> 00:41:38.528
You know what I mean.

491
00:41:41.628 --> 00:41:43.962
I don't know. maybe.

492
00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:47.761
I don't wanna lose you.

493
00:41:47.861 --> 00:41:49.162
Can we please just go?

494
00:41:51.062 --> 00:41:52.737
Why? Because some random guy's
following us?

495
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.494
You know. this is ridiculous.

496
00:41:56.028 --> 00:41:56.895
What are you doing?

497
00:41:56.995 --> 00:41:59.062
What does it look
like I'm doing?

498
00:42:00.062 --> 00:42:00.561
I am waiting and
letting him pass.

499
00:42:00.661 --> 00:42:02.595
Oh come on. don't.

500
00:42:02.695 --> 00:42:04.728
If you wanna leave Zoe.
then go for it.

501
00:42:07.428 --> 00:42:11.761
Jason. Pick up your bag
and come with me right now.

502
00:42:11.861 --> 00:42:13.428
- Why should I?
- Because it's him.

503
00:42:46.561 --> 00:42:48.528
Ok. That's enough.

504
00:42:48.628 --> 00:42:50.461
What are you gonna do?

505
00:42:52.861 --> 00:42:54.261
I'm gonna reason with the guy.

506
00:42:54.361 --> 00:42:55.470
He just followed us
to another island.

507
00:42:55.494 --> 00:42:58.428
does that sound like
he wants to reason with you?

508
00:42:58.528 --> 00:42:59.528
I don't know. Zoe.

509
00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:00.704
but Jesus Christ.
what else can we do?

510
00:43:00.728 --> 00:43:03.428
Let's go. right now.

511
00:43:03.528 --> 00:43:06.595
You can keep running away
from our problems. I'm not.

512
00:43:06.696 --> 00:43:10.028
Will you just drop the stroppy
child attitude and get serious?

513
00:43:10.128 --> 00:43:11.662
This guy is going to kill us.

514
00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:14.228
No. he's not.
People don't just do that.

515
00:43:15.828 --> 00:43:16.828
Let me handle this.

516
00:43:30.828 --> 00:43:32.261
What do you want. Michael?

517
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:38.028
It's ok. Alright. I'm just.
have something for you.

518
00:43:55.028 --> 00:43:57.662
You dropped this last night.

519
00:43:57.761 --> 00:44:02.095
You followed us all the way out
here. just to give me my wallet back?

520
00:44:08.828 --> 00:44:09.828
Why would you do that?

521
00:44:12.761 --> 00:44:14.795
I have my reasons.

522
00:44:18.662 --> 00:44:19.662
Like?

523
00:44:22.962 --> 00:44:25.461
I feel terrible
about last night.

524
00:44:26.294 --> 00:44:28.328
And I wanted to
talk to you guys.

525
00:44:34.596 --> 00:44:36.194
Well. thanks.

526
00:44:36.294 --> 00:44:39.962
Yeah. I'm really sorry
about last night.

527
00:44:40.062 --> 00:44:41.428
Let's just put it
behind us. yeah?

528
00:44:44.928 --> 00:44:46.461
It's too late for that. Jason.

529
00:44:59.828 --> 00:45:00.828
You got me.

530
00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:04.861
She thought you'd come
all this way out here

531
00:45:04.962 --> 00:45:06.261
to kill us or something.

532
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:12.294
No. Eventually. yes. but
we've got all day first.

533
00:45:14.596 --> 00:45:15.596
What?

534
00:45:25.161 --> 00:45:26.194
Work phone.

535
00:45:29.828 --> 00:45:32.728
You. Phone. now.

536
00:45:35.895 --> 00:45:37.127
What do you want?

537
00:45:37.962 --> 00:45:39.261
To educate Jason.

538
00:45:40.027 --> 00:45:43.394
You still have two strikes. Zoe.

539
00:45:43.495 --> 00:45:44.495
so go.

540
00:45:45.828 --> 00:45:48.394
What if I say. "no"?

541
00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:49.495
Take him.

542
00:45:50.995 --> 00:45:51.995
You'll just let us go?

543
00:45:54.428 --> 00:45:55.529
For now.

544
00:46:00.962 --> 00:46:02.161
Take him.

545
00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:04.328
Go on. Go!

546
00:46:06.662 --> 00:46:08.328
Run!

547
00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:44.596
Wait.

548
00:46:47.795 --> 00:46:49.495
No. no. gotta keep going.

549
00:46:49.596 --> 00:46:52.161
We'll check it when we can.
Come on.

550
00:47:03.662 --> 00:47:04.662
Wait. wait.

551
00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:14.294
Shit. That's your fault.

552
00:47:14.395 --> 00:47:16.994
Why couldn't you just
apologise last night?

553
00:47:17.094 --> 00:47:19.462
And why the hell did you
have your work phone on you?

554
00:47:20.861 --> 00:47:21.861
Look. I can explain.

555
00:47:21.961 --> 00:47:23.728
Nothing to explain.

556
00:47:24.596 --> 00:47:25.994
You are a liar.

557
00:47:27.127 --> 00:47:28.527
Can we deal with
this later. please?

558
00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:32.361
Later? You are not gonna be able
to charm your way out of this?

559
00:47:32.462 --> 00:47:34.495
I know. Zoe.

560
00:47:34.596 --> 00:47:35.927
Ok. so what now?

561
00:47:37.728 --> 00:47:40.861
Our best bet is to make it over
the trail and get back to the boat.

562
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:42.495
Some great thinking.

563
00:47:42.596 --> 00:47:45.629
- What do you suggest that we do?
- Hush.

564
00:47:46.795 --> 00:47:48.795
Voices.

565
00:47:48.894 --> 00:47:50.761
There's people up ahead.
Come on.

566
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:52.761
Oh. thank god.

567
00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:47.662
Come on.

568
00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:49.127
Hey!

569
00:48:49.228 --> 00:48:50.596
- Help!
- Oh. we found you.

570
00:48:50.696 --> 00:48:52.538
- Are you guys ok?
- Someone's trying to kill us.

571
00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:55.094
Ok. meet us at the fork.

572
00:49:04.827 --> 00:49:06.495
You're ok now.

573
00:49:07.927 --> 00:49:09.961
Are you injured?

574
00:49:10.061 --> 00:49:12.362
He hit me in the side.
around the kidney.

575
00:49:12.462 --> 00:49:15.061
I'm a nurse. let me take a look.

576
00:49:16.728 --> 00:49:17.261
Alright.

577
00:49:17.362 --> 00:49:20.161
Oh my goodness.

578
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:22.161
Oh. It's really
hard to say what that is.

579
00:49:22.261 --> 00:49:24.994
I mean. could be
internal bleeding.

580
00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.027
How do you feel?

581
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.596
Like I'm dying.

582
00:49:29.696 --> 00:49:32.662
Are you sure you didn't like.
fall and hurt yourself or something?

583
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:33.761
Look. we're not lying.

584
00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:35.271
There really is someone
trying to kill us.

585
00:49:35.295 --> 00:49:37.927
can you help? Please?

586
00:49:38.027 --> 00:49:39.070
Ok. I'll go and talk to him.

587
00:49:39.094 --> 00:49:42.794
No! No. Just call the police
or something.

588
00:49:42.894 --> 00:49:44.294
There is zero
reception around here.

589
00:49:44.362 --> 00:49:45.371
Be quicker to send
a smoke signal.

590
00:49:45.395 --> 00:49:47.462
Look. I'll go and find out
what's going on.

591
00:49:48.961 --> 00:49:50.827
I'll go with him.

592
00:49:50.927 --> 00:49:52.061
Hold up. Danielle.

593
00:49:52.161 --> 00:49:53.271
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

594
00:49:53.295 --> 00:49:54.927
Just let the poor
guy take care of it.

595
00:49:55.027 --> 00:49:55.629
that's what we're
paying him for.

596
00:49:55.728 --> 00:49:58.229
Seriously. Listen to her.

597
00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:00.927
I'm not gonna let him
do that on his own.

598
00:50:01.027 --> 00:50:02.037
Ok. well I'm not gonna
let you go alone either.

599
00:50:02.061 --> 00:50:04.794
You guys just wait here.
we'll sort this out. ok?

600
00:50:04.894 --> 00:50:06.094
We should stop them.

601
00:50:08.529 --> 00:50:10.927
Don't go. Please.

602
00:50:20.362 --> 00:50:21.362
Hi there.

603
00:50:29.127 --> 00:50:30.927
Hi.

604
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:35.736
Look. We don't know
what's going on with you three.

605
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.061
but we just wanna calm
the situation down.

606
00:50:39.961 --> 00:50:41.161
I don't think so.

607
00:50:43.727 --> 00:50:45.127
But this is your chance to go.

608
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:49.395
Look. we just wanna make sure
no one gets hurt.

609
00:50:51.195 --> 00:50:53.094
And all of you agree as a group?

610
00:51:04.662 --> 00:51:06.362
It counts as three
times in my book.

611
00:51:09.562 --> 00:51:10.570
Ok. calm down.

612
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.040
What's the matter with you. man?

613
00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:43.401
You two might wanna
get a head start.

614
00:51:49.695 --> 00:51:51.894
Gah!

615
00:51:52.994 --> 00:51:54.274
What are you gonna do with that?

616
00:52:01.927 --> 00:52:03.362
I hate weapons.

617
00:52:05.495 --> 00:52:06.495
Wait.

618
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:18.329
Take it.

619
00:52:20.794 --> 00:52:21.794
It's ok.

620
00:52:23.727 --> 00:52:26.329
You were just trying
to be helpful.

621
00:52:27.195 --> 00:52:29.095
It's ok.

622
00:52:30.596 --> 00:52:32.362
It'll all be over soon.

623
00:52:32.462 --> 00:52:34.295
Oh.

624
00:52:49.429 --> 00:52:50.827
15 seconds.

625
00:53:31.028 --> 00:53:32.894
Ok.

626
00:53:34.894 --> 00:53:36.329
Now you're
ready to listen to me?

627
00:53:38.661 --> 00:53:40.429
Good.

628
00:53:40.528 --> 00:53:45.028
We'll hide in the ruins. we'll
wait for Michael to go past.

629
00:53:45.128 --> 00:53:47.462
And then we'll turn back
and steal his boat.

630
00:53:48.595 --> 00:53:49.362
That's a good plan.

631
00:53:49.462 --> 00:53:52.262
If I make it that far.

632
00:53:53.927 --> 00:53:55.462
Oh. you'd better not die on me.

633
00:53:57.927 --> 00:53:59.327
I'd be really annoyed
with you then.

634
00:54:01.062 --> 00:54:02.062
Come on.

635
00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:27.062
You ok?

636
00:54:28.695 --> 00:54:29.760
Yeah.

637
00:54:32.128 --> 00:54:33.128
Liar.

638
00:54:34.794 --> 00:54:35.794
Come on. show me.

639
00:54:40.827 --> 00:54:42.028
Don't call me that.

640
00:54:44.262 --> 00:54:45.262
Well. you are.

641
00:54:50.827 --> 00:54:54.195
I have no excuse
about the work phone.

642
00:54:54.295 --> 00:54:57.028
Or any of my behaviour
over the last few years.

643
00:54:57.128 --> 00:55:01.062
I messed up our business and
left you to pick up the pieces

644
00:55:01.162 --> 00:55:04.727
while I ran away. got a job.

645
00:55:06.028 --> 00:55:07.894
And for that. it's so much more.

646
00:55:07.995 --> 00:55:09.860
I want you to know

647
00:55:09.962 --> 00:55:12.395
in case I don't
make it out of here

648
00:55:12.494 --> 00:55:16.262
that I'm really.
truly sorry. Zoe.

649
00:55:16.362 --> 00:55:21.295
And I promise you if i'm
lucky enough not to die today

650
00:55:21.395 --> 00:55:24.229
that I will spend the rest
of my life making it up to you.

651
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:31.195
Let's go hide.

652
00:58:44.728 --> 00:58:46.661
Did you see him tracking us?

653
00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:49.062
Yeah. He's a pro.

654
00:58:49.162 --> 00:58:51.162
This isn't gonna
fool him for long.

655
00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.470
We need to get out
of here. quick.

656
00:58:52.494 --> 00:58:54.162
Agreed.

657
00:58:56.761 --> 00:58:58.561
What?

658
00:58:58.661 --> 00:59:02.795
Nothing. I just. I didn't
realise how much I missed this.

659
00:59:02.895 --> 00:59:05.095
What. get together. you mean?

660
00:59:08.162 --> 00:59:09.162
Come on.

661
00:59:14.328 --> 00:59:15.394
Stop right there.

662
00:59:17.561 --> 00:59:19.162
Get back.

663
00:59:20.428 --> 00:59:21.428
Get back.

664
00:59:21.461 --> 00:59:24.595
Base. come in. Come in. base.

665
00:59:24.696 --> 00:59:27.728
Whoa. You don't need
to point that at us.

666
00:59:27.828 --> 00:59:29.095
We're the victims here.

667
00:59:33.728 --> 00:59:35.028
Please.

668
00:59:35.795 --> 00:59:37.795
We really need your help.

669
00:59:37.895 --> 00:59:39.995
I've just seen three bodies.

670
00:59:40.795 --> 00:59:42.828
Hikers. We know.

671
00:59:42.928 --> 00:59:44.261
No. no. no. no.

672
00:59:44.361 --> 00:59:46.628
The man that is
chasing us did that.

673
00:59:46.728 --> 00:59:51.461
And he is gonna be here at any minute
now. so you need to listen.

674
00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:53.494
Listen. he's telling
you the truth.

675
00:59:53.595 --> 00:59:57.261
We are all in big trouble
unless you get us out of here.

676
00:59:57.861 --> 00:59:59.728
Show me your permits.

677
01:00:00.062 --> 01:00:01.995
What?

678
01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:04.337
Your permits if you really are hikers.
You will have permits?

679
01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:07.696
Ok. but we left our bags
when he attacked us.

680
01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:09.662
Just came from that direction.

681
01:00:09.761 --> 01:00:12.361
Didn't see any bags.
Just dead bodies.

682
01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:13.605
You cannot be serious right now.

683
01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:16.629
Normally. I would tell him to
be more relaxed. but he's right.

684
01:00:16.728 --> 01:00:19.595
You cannot be serious.

685
01:00:23.728 --> 01:00:24.962
Put them on.

686
01:00:34.528 --> 01:00:35.528
No.

687
01:00:38.662 --> 01:00:43.194
Look. You story checks out.
you got nothing to worry about.

688
01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:46.228
You don't get it.

689
01:00:46.328 --> 01:00:48.461
Put on the handcuffs.

690
01:00:48.995 --> 01:00:49.995
Ok.

691
01:00:50.861 --> 01:00:52.328
Let's just do it. Zoe.

692
01:01:26.728 --> 01:01:28.228
Good. Sit.

693
01:01:29.528 --> 01:01:30.528
Sit?

694
01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.228
Now.

695
01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:39.494
Come on. mates. come on.

696
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:42.428
Got a real situation here.

697
01:01:45.428 --> 01:01:47.394
Oh my god.

698
01:01:47.494 --> 01:01:48.494
What?

699
01:01:52.562 --> 01:01:53.562
Hi.

700
01:01:55.161 --> 01:01:56.294
Whoa. whoa.

701
01:01:57.127 --> 01:02:01.761
Stay right there. Don't move.

702
01:02:12.828 --> 01:02:13.828
Stop right there.

703
01:02:14.895 --> 01:02:17.194
Not a problem. friend.

704
01:02:18.562 --> 01:02:19.562
Don't move.

705
01:02:21.228 --> 01:02:22.228
What's the issue?

706
01:02:23.795 --> 01:02:24.795
Do you know these people?

707
01:02:26.127 --> 01:02:26.828
I don't know who they are?

708
01:02:26.928 --> 01:02:30.027
I'm just hiking the trail.

709
01:02:30.127 --> 01:02:31.361
Oh yeah? Show me your permit.

710
01:02:35.428 --> 01:02:36.428
Slowly.

711
01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:15.495
Jason sellers?

712
01:03:16.795 --> 01:03:17.994
That's me.

713
01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:22.429
Sorry about that. sir.

714
01:03:23.961 --> 01:03:26.094
We had an incident.

715
01:03:26.194 --> 01:03:28.194
I'm gonna have to
ask you to turn back.

716
01:03:28.294 --> 01:03:30.861
An incident. oh my god.
What happened?

717
01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:31.961
We're investigating.

718
01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:34.127
Just turn back and go
where you came from.

719
01:03:34.828 --> 01:03:36.027
Sure thing.

720
01:03:41.895 --> 01:03:43.228
What's the deal with those two?

721
01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.828
Suspects.

722
01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:48.287
Apparently they're
innocent though.

723
01:03:54.194 --> 01:03:56.395
How many times
did they claim that?

724
01:03:57.429 --> 01:03:58.429
Mmm?

725
01:03:58.495 --> 01:04:02.761
How many times did they claim
they were innocent?

726
01:04:02.861 --> 01:04:04.161
More than three?

727
01:04:05.629 --> 01:04:07.027
A bunch of times. why?

728
01:04:50.994 --> 01:04:56.761
Guns are such an uncivilized
way to handle your grievances.

729
01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:57.894
Look what you've done.

730
01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.994
Another person hurt.

731
01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:02.395
'cause you couldn't admit
you were wrong.

732
01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:09.127
Stand up. you two.

733
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:13.395
Stand up.

734
01:05:23.562 --> 01:05:26.027
Zoe. Come here.

735
01:05:27.827 --> 01:05:30.061
Just let her go.

736
01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:35.261
That's entirely up
to her. isn't it?

737
01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.961
Don't you touch her.

738
01:05:56.061 --> 01:05:58.329
- I'll fucking kill you.
- Oh.

739
01:06:18.894 --> 01:06:20.228
So here we are.

740
01:06:23.061 --> 01:06:25.429
It's your third
and final chance.

741
01:06:29.794 --> 01:06:31.329
Stay with Jason...

742
01:06:34.529 --> 01:06:38.760
Or leave him
and live a happy life.

743
01:06:44.161 --> 01:06:46.760
Zoe? It's ok.

744
01:06:49.362 --> 01:06:50.462
So what do you say. Zoe?

745
01:06:53.194 --> 01:06:53.662
Do you accept?

746
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.429
She accepts. she accepts.

747
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:59.794
I'm gonna need to hear her
say it. thank you. Jason.

748
01:07:03.727 --> 01:07:04.194
Zoe.

749
01:07:04.295 --> 01:07:06.994
Is it a yes?

750
01:07:07.094 --> 01:07:09.894
Three seconds. Zoe.
Three. two. one.

751
01:07:09.994 --> 01:07:12.094
Yes. yes. I accept.

752
01:07:23.994 --> 01:07:26.329
I was rooting for you.

753
01:07:31.529 --> 01:07:33.094
You're free to go.

754
01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:41.027
Go on.

755
01:07:48.662 --> 01:07:49.662
Go.

756
01:08:23.727 --> 01:08:25.229
Just you and me. pal.

757
01:08:30.727 --> 01:08:31.727
Let's take a walk.

758
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.760
No.

759
01:08:48.295 --> 01:08:49.295
Help.

760
01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.061
Please help.

761
01:08:54.562 --> 01:08:55.562
Oh god.

762
01:09:14.295 --> 01:09:19.128
Zoe.

763
01:10:27.727 --> 01:10:28.894
Fuck you.

764
01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:36.495
You know. there was a time I would
have let you die with these on.

765
01:10:38.362 --> 01:10:41.995
But might as well give you
some dignity. Come on.

766
01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:01.329
You don't have to do this.

767
01:11:03.494 --> 01:11:05.038
Isn't it amazing how quickly
someone tries to apologise

768
01:11:05.062 --> 01:11:07.429
when they think
they're about to die?

769
01:11:09.362 --> 01:11:11.262
Where is that attitude
in the restaurant

770
01:11:11.362 --> 01:11:13.528
when you were
disrespecting your wife?

771
01:11:13.628 --> 01:11:16.395
Just kill me and
get it over with.

772
01:11:20.595 --> 01:11:23.329
Ok. Time to die.

773
01:12:09.928 --> 01:12:11.794
You are so fucked.

774
01:12:38.895 --> 01:12:40.162
Ok. let me look at you.

775
01:12:40.262 --> 01:12:42.128
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Come on. come on.

776
01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.162
You came back for me.

777
01:12:49.062 --> 01:12:50.695
I did.

778
01:12:50.794 --> 01:12:52.305
And look what I took
from the ranger's body.

779
01:12:52.329 --> 01:12:55.262
It doesn't work down here though.
so we need to find higher ground.

780
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.128
Look. There looks good.

781
01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:17.128
You holding up ok?

782
01:13:21.794 --> 01:13:23.995
I'll be ok if this thing works.

783
01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.255
Ok. well there's not gonna
be a better place to try it.

784
01:13:31.794 --> 01:13:32.828
Hello?

785
01:13:38.328 --> 01:13:40.229
Hello. anyone? Please.

786
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:42.461
Oh come on.

787
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.795
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

788
01:13:57.895 --> 01:13:59.727
This is pascan one.
who's calling?

789
01:14:03.595 --> 01:14:04.595
Henry?

790
01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:07.062
I can't understand.
repeat please?

791
01:14:07.995 --> 01:14:09.162
Henry. is that you?

792
01:14:10.828 --> 01:14:13.095
Jason. is that you?

793
01:14:13.195 --> 01:14:14.195
<i>Where'd you get a radio?</i>

794
01:14:18.361 --> 01:14:19.461
Oh.

795
01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:20.561
I'm sorry.

796
01:14:21.861 --> 01:14:24.195
Henry it's us. it's Jason.

797
01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.394
<i>Henry we...</i>

798
01:14:27.294 --> 01:14:31.095
Jason. I can't understand what
you're saying. repeat please.

799
01:14:31.195 --> 01:14:35.628
<i>That at the bar he started us.</i>

800
01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:37.487
Jason. I can't understand
what you're saying.

801
01:14:37.561 --> 01:14:38.895
your message is
coming in garbled.

802
01:14:38.995 --> 01:14:40.428
I'm calling emergency services.

803
01:14:40.528 --> 01:14:43.162
if you can hear me.
I'm calling emergency services.

804
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:47.361
Jason.

805
01:14:48.428 --> 01:14:50.528
You think he heard us?

806
01:14:50.628 --> 01:14:54.195
I think we just gotta keep
moving and hope for the best.

807
01:14:54.294 --> 01:14:57.328
We're almost at the end
of the trail. just push through.

808
01:14:58.528 --> 01:15:00.229
Can you?

809
01:15:00.328 --> 01:15:01.461
I can if you can.

810
01:15:03.661 --> 01:15:04.661
Yeah.

811
01:15:08.561 --> 01:15:09.728
He's back.

812
01:15:17.328 --> 01:15:18.328
What do we do?

813
01:15:19.595 --> 01:15:22.761
Come on. I have an idea.

814
01:15:30.696 --> 01:15:32.261
Son of a bitch.

815
01:18:21.127 --> 01:18:25.127
Jason! Zoe! Can you hear me?

816
01:18:25.228 --> 01:18:28.728
- Henry? Oh thank god.
- Jason!

817
01:18:28.828 --> 01:18:31.028
Shh. oh Henry shut up.
he's gonna hear you.

818
01:18:31.127 --> 01:18:31.928
Maybe. do think he did it?

819
01:18:32.028 --> 01:18:34.895
He called the police. I mean.

820
01:18:34.995 --> 01:18:36.529
I don't know. but we gotta go.

821
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:37.629
Ok.

822
01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:50.995
Oh. there you are.

823
01:18:51.328 --> 01:18:52.328
Henry!

824
01:18:58.094 --> 01:18:59.228
We're so happy to see you.

825
01:18:59.328 --> 01:19:01.261
What's so wrong?
What the hell happened to you?

826
01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:03.928
- Where are the police?
- The police?

827
01:19:04.027 --> 01:19:05.307
Yeah. didn't you
get our message?

828
01:19:05.394 --> 01:19:07.538
I couldn't understand what you
were saying. it was all garbled.

829
01:19:07.562 --> 01:19:08.562
Oh shit.

830
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:10.495
But I did call the
emergency services.

831
01:19:10.596 --> 01:19:12.428
And how long
did they say they'd be?

832
01:19:12.529 --> 01:19:13.529
They didn't say.

833
01:19:15.261 --> 01:19:16.361
You must be the captain.

834
01:19:18.161 --> 01:19:21.428
Thought you were smarter
than that. Zoe.

835
01:19:21.529 --> 01:19:22.795
How you'll have to die too.

836
01:19:29.027 --> 01:19:30.061
Run.

837
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:41.109
I'm only gonna give
you three chances.

838
01:19:48.662 --> 01:19:49.662
That's one.

839
01:20:15.795 --> 01:20:17.495
That's two.

840
01:20:29.662 --> 01:20:31.328
Three.

841
01:20:49.161 --> 01:20:51.261
This was my favourite t-shirt.

842
01:20:58.562 --> 01:20:59.562
We're almost there.

843
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:42.462
The boat's gotta be over there.

844
01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:45.728
Ok. Let's go.

845
01:21:45.828 --> 01:21:51.529
No. No. Get to the boat.
Radio for help.

846
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:53.994
What are you gonna do?

847
01:21:54.094 --> 01:21:56.927
Give him the run around.
buy us time until police arrive.

848
01:21:57.027 --> 01:22:00.161
Ok. It's a good plan.

849
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.294
I love you.

850
01:22:03.927 --> 01:22:05.329
I love you too.

851
01:23:21.462 --> 01:23:24.194
End of the trail. Michael.

852
01:23:24.295 --> 01:23:25.295
End of the trail.

853
01:23:32.728 --> 01:23:33.728
Where's the wife?

854
01:23:35.161 --> 01:23:36.262
She's gone.

855
01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:39.727
Don't worry.

856
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.894
I'll catch up with her.

857
01:23:48.596 --> 01:23:49.596
Now what?

858
01:23:51.195 --> 01:23:53.395
You both know what happens next.

859
01:23:55.727 --> 01:23:56.994
For what it's worth.

860
01:23:59.462 --> 01:24:00.462
I get it now.

861
01:24:02.161 --> 01:24:05.462
I met a lot of people like you.

862
01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:08.229
I take it we're not the first
couple you've done this to.

863
01:24:08.696 --> 01:24:10.229
You sick fuck.

864
01:24:16.329 --> 01:24:18.295
You know what
my biggest takeaway is?

865
01:24:20.662 --> 01:24:21.662
Enlighten me.

866
01:24:24.495 --> 01:24:26.462
No one ever really changes.

867
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.362
They just say they have.

868
01:24:33.495 --> 01:24:34.495
You did.

869
01:24:39.794 --> 01:24:41.027
Ready?

870
01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:52.961
Good for you.

871
01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:17.529
Liar.

872
01:25:48.027 --> 01:25:49.347
This is where you
proposed to Zoe?

873
01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.927
First or second floor?

874
01:25:55.295 --> 01:25:57.229
Fuck you.

875
01:26:01.495 --> 01:26:02.495
Second.

876
01:26:51.529 --> 01:26:53.495
I'm gonna beat my persona best.

877
01:26:55.827 --> 01:26:58.295
You really think i'd
fall for that twice?

878
01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.429
Do you think he's still alive?

879
01:27:16.362 --> 01:27:17.362
No way.

880
01:27:17.595 --> 01:27:19.028
Good.

881
01:27:38.494 --> 01:27:42.229
We can't get out of here.
We can't even drive that thing.

882
01:27:42.329 --> 01:27:44.089
Well. Henry said he radioed
the park service.

883
01:27:44.162 --> 01:27:46.642
so let's just get back on the
boat and wait for them to arrive.

884
01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:48.128
Ok. good.

885
01:27:50.295 --> 01:27:52.062
'Cause I don't wanna
go hiking anymore.

886
01:28:02.329 --> 01:28:03.329
Come on.

887
01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:31.727
Thank god you got out
of those clothes.

888
01:28:33.827 --> 01:28:34.894
Celebrating?

889
01:28:36.794 --> 01:28:37.962
