00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.902
Welcome to the world of U.

2
00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:49.008
U is the ultimate virtual community
created by 5 sages called the Voices

3
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:50.801
that govern it.

4
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:55.598
The biggest Internet society in history
that's still growing

5
00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:58.768
with over 5 billion registered users.

6
00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:17.369
Launch the U app.

7
00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:22.500
U employs the latest body-sharing technology

8
00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.128
that allows everybody to relax.
get together. and have fun.

9
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.847
Your avatar in U is called "AS."

10
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.393
It is automatically created based on
your biometric information.

11
00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:12.383
U is another reality. AS is another you.

12
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.680
You can't start over in reality
but you can start over in U.

13
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.238
Come one. come a million. follow the beat

14
00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:38.993
Tap your heels. let your heart dance

15
00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.288
Come one. come a billion. dive into the heat

16
00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:46.709
Tap your heels. let your heart dance

17
00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.838
Get on and dance this twisted world away

18
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.927
Fly through this untold. nameless moment

19
00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:59.263
Reaching out for the crescent moon

20
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:03.893
Though at times I can't find my voice

21
00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:07.479
I still want to want to know you

22
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.234
You can live as another you.

23
00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.404
You can start a new life.

24
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.199
You can change the world.

25
00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.412
Time waits for no one

26
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:29.710
Suzu!

27
00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:31.837
What's going on?

28
00:03:33.464 --> 00:03:34.590
Nothing!

29
00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.523
Do you want a ride?

30
00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:53.234
No.

31
00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:54.318
How about dinner?

32
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.111
No thanks.

33
00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:01.367
Okay. I'll see you later then.

34
00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:08.958
Bell is the hottest girl in U.

35
00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.751
Her songs are so unique.

36
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.878
She sings so confidently.

37
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.548
The biggest attention-getter
out of the 5 billion users.

38
00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.301
Who is she?

39
00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:37.152
BELLE

40
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.661
"Club activities"

41
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.090
She's so pretty.

42
00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.593
Luka is the school princess.

43
00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:46.347
- Such long. slender legs.
- She looks like a model.

44
00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.140
Totally.

45
00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.602
Jealousy of girls who aren't like her.

46
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.020
Hiro...

47
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.940
It's no surprise she's our class leader.

48
00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.943
She attracts people like the sun.

49
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.529
I know what you mean.

50
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.073
I'd be annoyed.

51
00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:08.952
Lucky for you. you're like the far side
of the moon that gets ignored.

52
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.913
Hiro...

53
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:15.376
Could you tone down your wisecracks about me?

54
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.628
Join the canoe club!

55
00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:20.089
Wanna join the canoe club?

56
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.466
- Drop it. Kamishin.
- No thanks.

57
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:25.010
Hey! Wanna go canoeing?

58
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.598
Kamishin is incredible.
He started the canoe club.

59
00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.558
And he's the only member.

60
00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.477
- Why?
- What do you mean?

61
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:34.812
Canoe!

62
00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:37.231
Let's go canoeing!

63
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.943
Come back! Don't run away!

64
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.487
Putting it nicely. people think he's a fool.

65
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:08.137
I never thought Shinobu would get so tall.

66
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.847
A childhood friend?

67
00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:14.393
He proposed to me once.

68
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.603
Seriously? Like how?

69
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.189
He said. "Suzu. I'll protect you."

70
00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.482
When?

71
00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:21.984
We were six.

72
00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:26.071
That was years ago.

73
00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:37.082
Yes.

74
00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.836
Something happened years ago.

75
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.262
Help me!

76
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.141
Help!

77
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.692
Don't go! Mom. don't go!

78
00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:29.570
I have to or she'll die.

79
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.992
Mom! Mom! Mom!

80
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.337
Mom...

81
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.549
Mom! Mom!

82
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:52.718
Mom!

83
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.857
Don't go. Mom...

84
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:09.067
Mom...

85
00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:23.206
She practically committed
suicide jumping into the river.

86
00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:26.126
A raging river's not like a pool.

87
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.254
She died for some stranger's kid and
abandoned her own.

88
00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:32.716
I don't want to play in the river anymore.

89
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.761
She shouldn't have tried to be a hero.

90
00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:56.948
Why did Mom go into the river and leave me behind?

91
00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:01.912
Why was a stranger's life more important
than her life with me?

92
00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.873
Why am I all alone?

93
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:06.875
Why?

94
00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.294
Why?

95
00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.868
- Wait!
- Hurry!

96
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.291
- No!
- Come on!

97
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.126
No...

98
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.134
Peggie Sue is so cute!

99
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:59.219
This is a big hit in U.

100
00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:07.310
- Let's sing.
- You sing.

101
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.772
- You have to sing too.
- You can sing. right?

102
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.024
- Sing.
- Let's sing.

103
00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.318
- Sing.
- Hurry up and sing.

104
00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.278
Sing!

105
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:38.341
The flowers that sparkle

106
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:03.158
"Hiro: Check this out LOL"

107
00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:06.369
"Invitation to U"

108
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.503
U?

109
00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:19.424
U is another reality. AS is another you.

110
00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:24.137
You can't start over in reality
but you can start over in U.

111
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.849
You can live as another you.

112
00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:31.186
You can start a new life.

113
00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:34.314
You can change the world.

"Synchronizing"

115
00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:41.029
Name?

116
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:53.792
- I wanna be next to Luka.
- Me too.

117
00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.169
- That's not fair.
- I wanna be by Luka.

118
00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.755
Luka. look over here. Ready?

119
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.174
Suzu!

120
00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.593
Take a picture with us!

121
00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.136
No... I'm fine...

122
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.013

What? Is this Luka?

125
00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:22.404
No. Go back. Cancel.

126
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.869
Freckles?

127
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.164
My gosh... Is this me?

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.587
"Suzu" means bell so...

129
00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:41.756
What should I do?

130
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.636
No? Yes?

"Detecting device"

132
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.104
Put on the device.

133
00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:01.443
Reading your biometric information.

134
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:05.071
Complete. Initiate body sharing.

135
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.074
First. your vision will enter U.

136
00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:20.170
Now your cognitive function and
deep sensations in the limbs.

137
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:26.134
Transferring your physical senses
and body control to your AS.

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.650
Welcome to the world of U.

140
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:12.847
Be my guide

141
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.019
Did I just sing?

142
00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.023
I can finally sing again.

143
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.863
I want to picture a world

144
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:38.707
where a simple song can make the difference

145
00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:43.003
Each day I wake. searching...

146
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:50.760
I don't want to imagine a future without you

147
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.888
I can't do that

148
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.892
But you're gone. the answer escapes me

149
00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:01.396
Seems like everyone else has it figured out

150
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:05.567
Still. tomorrow will come

151
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.403
Who's singing?

152
00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:09.821
What a strange song.

153
00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:14.242
Melody. be my guide!

154
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:20.749
It makes me sick. why is everybody so happy?

155
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:24.294
Do you really need someone to love?

156
00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:25.962
Shut up!

157
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.380
What a weird song.

158
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:28.840
Stop showing off!

159
00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.134
She's not ugly but...

160
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.261
Look at those freckles.

161
00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:34.804
Ew.

162
00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.097

But you're gone. the answer escapes me

181
00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:54.611
Wow!

182
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.613
- Never heard it before.
- She's good.

183
00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.406
- Oddly pretty.
- What's this song called?

184
00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.283
No hits in searches.

185
00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:01.951
Crazy fashion.

186
00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:04.454
- I'm hooked on her.
- Who knows more about Bell?

187
00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.248
Bell?

188
00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:12.003
I've heard her sing but she's nothing special.

189
00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.129
Yeah!

190
00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.964
- Irritating voice.
- Too flashy.

191
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:16.466
Selling her sex appeal?

192
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.134
No basic music skills.

193
00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.594
The arrangements are good.

194
00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.346
Done by other people.

195
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.556
Take music seriously!

196
00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.476
But...

197
00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:29.145
I can't stop listening to this song.

198
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.396
Why?

199
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:31.648
Why?

200
00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.775
It feels like she's singing for me.

201
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.735
For my ears only.

202
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.278
No. For mine.

203
00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.405
No. She's singing just for me.

204
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.740
- Why?
- Why?

205
00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.617
- How come?
- Why?

206
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.539
Have you heard of Bell?

207
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.083
Of course.

208
00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:51.960
- Who's that?
- The girl in U. right?

209
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.670
She's new.

210
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.847
Hello!

211
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:09.102
Hiro! Guess what happened! Bell...

212
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:10.395
I know.

213
00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:13.481
She made it onto the U Global Music Hits.

214
00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:14.524
Just as I expected.

215
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.944
No! She's being roasted like crazy!

216
00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.529
Also expected.

217
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.864
They're just jealous of you.

218
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:25.868
If you only get compliments.
you only have hard-core fans.

219
00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.370
Minor league.

220
00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:31.040
In U. stardom is built on mixed opinions.

221
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.750
Half of them don't like me?!

222
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.335
I wanna die!

223
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:38.047
But the other half likes you. Be more confident.

224
00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.549
The secret to your success?

225
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.551
I look like Luka.

226
00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.677
And?

227
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.388
People who arrange my songs.

228
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:46.472
What else?

229
00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:49.851
You're my producer. Costumes. dances. and...

230
00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:52.854
No! Yes but no!

231
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:55.523
The biggest secret is that it's in U!

232
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:59.736
Its body-sharing technology
draws out the user's hidden strengths.

233
00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:04.741
Without it. you wouldn't be singing
but crying all the time like usual.

234
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.534
Look at this.

235
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.703
Search for Bell's identity...

236
00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:11.039
What?! Oh no!

237
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.750
It's funny how wrong they are.

238
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.169
They're naming all these celebrities.

239
00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:18.254
So far from the truth.

240
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.881
It's not funny!

241
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:26.179
Nobody would ever guess that Bell
is a mousy country bumpkin like you.

242
00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:28.639
You're scary.

243
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.975
This is the best game ever.

244
00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:35.980
Turning a nerdy.
freckled schoolgirl into U's superstar.

245
00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:40.777
This could mean big money. but don't worry.

246
00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:44.906
I'll anonymously donate every dollar to charities.

247
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:50.661
Fly through this untold. nameless moment

248
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:53.873
Reaching out for the crescent moon

249
00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:56.209
Bell is our new diva.

250
00:22:56.292 --> 00:23:00.254
Isn't B-E-L-L-E more suitable for her?

251
00:23:00.421 --> 00:23:03.007
- Belle?
- "Beautiful" in French.

252
00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:06.344
A perfect name for a girl who's not quite perfect.

253
00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:09.555
Putting it mildly. Belle is the best!

254
00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:11.057
This has got to be a joke!

255
00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:14.102
Why is she more popular than me?!

256
00:23:14.102 --> 00:23:15.561
- It's Peggie Sue.
- She's finished.

257
00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:18.773
What? Hey! Get away from me!

258
00:23:21.442 --> 00:23:24.070
You jealous creeps!

259
00:23:24.195 --> 00:23:26.781
Belle has changed the world!

260
00:23:26.864 --> 00:23:29.909
More excitement! More spotlight!

261
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:32.412
Belle is the best!

262
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.458
What's so funny. Hiroka?!

263
00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.461
This room is off limits now.

264
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:53.724
"Congratulations. graduates!"

265
00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:59.730
"Graduation performances"

266
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:22.545
You can use closed school buildings
for community activities.

267
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.423
Let's take a look over there.

268
00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:34.348
Weird. huh?
Practicing for a Christmas concert with cicadas.

269
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:36.726
Come out and sing.

270
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:38.019
I can't.

271
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.772
Only a bell cricket sings in
the shadows like that.

272
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:43.524
I don't mind being a bell cricket.

273
00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:45.902
The youngest member should sing in the center.

274
00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:46.903
I don't want to.

275
00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:49.572
Kids these days lack ambition.

276
00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:51.240
Don't you want to be happy?

277
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:54.577
I'm sure your mom wants you to be happy.

278
00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:56.621
Happy? How?

279
00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:59.332
How can I find happiness?

280
00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:01.542
Well...

281
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.002
Happiness...

282
00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:06.964
Happiness?

283
00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:12.011
Even at this age. I'm not sure what happiness is.

284
00:25:18.184 --> 00:25:20.853
Why are you looking at us like that?

285
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:23.731
Trying to figure out who's right?

286
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:29.237
We wouldn't be so frustrated if
there was a right answer to happiness!

287
00:25:36.077 --> 00:25:37.745
Why are you crying?

288
00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:41.874
Why won't you say something?

289
00:25:50.258 --> 00:25:51.259
Suzu.

290
00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:54.470
Shinobu!

291
00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:55.763
How's your dad?

292
00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:57.974
Fine... I think...

293
00:25:58.099 --> 00:26:01.310
You think? Are you eating properly?

294
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:02.562
Yeah...

295
00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:05.106
What's the matter?

296
00:26:06.566 --> 00:26:08.317
- Nothing.
- I don't believe you.

297
00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:10.444
- I swear...
- Look at me.

298
00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:12.780
I can't.

299
00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:13.948
Look at me.

300
00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:21.122
Tell me.

301
00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:24.375
Tell me.

302
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:33.217
Suzu... Suzu!

303
00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:42.101
Shinobu. I'm not the girl you knew
in elementary school.

304
00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:45.980
You don't have to worry about me...

305
00:26:46.397 --> 00:26:47.523
anymore...

306
00:27:17.178 --> 00:27:20.306
Coming up at U standard time 20:25

307
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:25.019
the biggest concert by
Belle in the spherical stadium.

308
00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:27.438
Setting a record as a newcomer to U

309
00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:32.318
she's expected to draw
millions and millions of viewers worldwide.

310
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:36.489
People are waiting on the edge of their seats.

311
00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:55.526
Thank you.

312
00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:37.026
Belle. you're doing great. Next song.

313
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:38.152
Okay.

314
00:29:46.744 --> 00:29:48.788
Who opened the dome?!

315
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:52.166
Get out of here!

316
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:53.459
He's being chased?

317
00:30:03.177 --> 00:30:05.179
Who is that?

318
00:30:08.182 --> 00:30:08.933
Dragon?

319
00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:11.435
An ugly monster that lives in U.

320
00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:22.988
- Wow.
- Who is it?

321
00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:25.950
He fights in the martial arts arena.

322
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.327
The record holder of consecutive wins.

323
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:30.371
But he fights dirty.

324
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:31.539
Like how?

325
00:30:37.628 --> 00:30:38.671
Go!

326
00:30:44.385 --> 00:30:45.594
He ruins the matches.

327
00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:48.305
He attacks until the data breaks down.

328
00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:50.391
Like he's venting his anger.

329
00:30:50.391 --> 00:30:53.561
He wants to show off the bruises on his back.

330
00:30:53.811 --> 00:30:57.231
He's covered in bruises.

331
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.701
Who's chasing him?

332
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:10.744
- The Justices.
- Justices?

333
00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:14.206
They claim to be the protectors of
justice and order in U.

334
00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:16.750
They look like superheroes.

335
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:36.478
How brutal!

336
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:38.522
You've taken this too far!

337
00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:40.316
Is everything about you?!

338
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:41.942
Yeah!

339
00:31:41.942 --> 00:31:43.611
You ruined Belle's concert!

340
00:31:43.777 --> 00:31:45.029
Take responsibility!

341
00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:47.156
- Apologize to Belle!
- You wasted our time!

342
00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:49.617
- Get out of here!
- Leave!

343
00:31:53.746 --> 00:31:54.872
Hey...

344
00:31:57.541 --> 00:31:59.919
Who are you?

345
00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:03.005
Who...?

346
00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:04.423
Don't look.

347
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.552
Don't look at me.

348
00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:13.349
Beast!

349
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:17.770
Unforgivable. You will not get away with this!

350
00:32:18.228 --> 00:32:21.398
We have to get rid of the Beast
to maintain peace in U.

351
00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:22.483
Is he the leader?

352
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:24.276
Yeah. That's Justin.

353
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:25.319
Look.

354
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:41.377
The light of truth that
protects justice and order in U.

355
00:32:41.377 --> 00:32:45.297
We'll unveil the horrible Beast!

356
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.968
Look at all those sponsors.

357
00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:50.886
- Unveil?
- Yes. unveil.

358
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.481
Close it!

359
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:18.789
You're finished. Beast.

360
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:21.834
I'm going to reveal your ugly "Origin."

361
00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:23.836
Yeah! Do it!

362
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:42.187
Get him!

363
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:54.116
Jerk! You could've hurt Belle!

364
00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:23.896
No... This is unacceptable.

365
00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:32.946
I will unveil him one day!

366
00:34:37.451 --> 00:34:40.412
Who are you?

367
00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.174
There. See you later.

368
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.135
Suzu. dinner?

369
00:34:57.888 --> 00:34:59.515
How about seafood?

370
00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:02.101
Okay.

371
00:35:04.186 --> 00:35:06.230
"Belle cancels concert."

372
00:35:07.147 --> 00:35:08.315
I'm so sorry.

373
00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:14.571
Ow!

374
00:35:15.114 --> 00:35:18.242
It's that Beast guy's fault.

375
00:35:18.242 --> 00:35:20.244
He should get unveiled already.

376
00:35:20.244 --> 00:35:22.538
Why does he annoy people on purpose?

377
00:35:22.538 --> 00:35:23.997
He thinks he's cool.

378
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.707
There must be a reason.

379
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.292
He's just showing off.

380
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:28.460
You think so?

381
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.505
We should unveil him ourselves.

382
00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:36.051
Kamishin. what's with that huge bag?

383
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:39.012
I have an away match. You too?

384
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:40.889
I'm not like you.

385
00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:43.267
"The structure of U"

386
00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:47.688
The AS is constantly in sync with
the user's biometric info.

387
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:50.774
So you can't have two avatars.

388
00:35:51.692 --> 00:35:53.694
I searched all over the Internet

389
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:57.239
but there's no data about
his nationality. age. or gender.

390
00:35:57.239 --> 00:36:00.534
Only that he suddenly appeared 7 months ago.

391
00:36:00.534 --> 00:36:02.077
There's no way to find him?

392
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:03.453
Not the user.

393
00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:07.166
But there are records of his past opponents.

394
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:08.041
I see.

395
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:12.671
In 7 months. he won 369 matches.
lost 3. and tied in 2.

396
00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:18.844
Most of his 374 opponents have
other SNS accounts linked with U.

397
00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:22.181
We should talk to them and see what they know.

398
00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:28.437
"We will be using the study room."

399
00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:32.649
Wow.

400
00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:37.863
A question to the Beast's opponents.

401
00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:39.239
Who is he?

402
00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:40.741
A mystery.

403
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:42.201
Definitely not AI.

404
00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:43.744
Excessively aggressive.

405
00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:44.828
Bad personality.

406
00:36:45.078 --> 00:36:47.122
- Why does he...
- Take things so far?

407
00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:49.208
I was one of his first opponents.

408
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.460
He didn't have as many bruises.

409
00:36:51.752 --> 00:36:53.587
They're battle scars?

410
00:36:53.754 --> 00:36:56.423
The few of you who beat him.

411
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.634
How did you win?

412
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.594
He suddenly threw the match.

413
00:37:01.094 --> 00:37:02.971
He got distracted.

414
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:05.849
Angel...

415
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.517
Do you know something?

416
00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:13.148
Any rumors?

417
00:37:13.273 --> 00:37:15.067
- No.
- Maybe it's him.

418
00:37:15.192 --> 00:37:16.944
- Him?
- With the bruises.

419
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.111
Who?

420
00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:27.079
Jellinek. an obscure modern artist.

421
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.250
He started getting tattoos that look like bruises

422
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.086
around the time the Beast showed up.

423
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:37.547
The value of his artwork has increased 20 times.

424
00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:38.966
That's suspicious.

425
00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:41.134
His agent's contact info.

426
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:42.261
Let's call him.

427
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:44.263
Are you serious?!

428
00:37:45.973 --> 00:37:47.224
I have nothing to say.

429
00:37:47.224 --> 00:37:48.517
Why the tattoos?

430
00:37:48.517 --> 00:37:49.935
Who are you?!

431
00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:52.604
What were you doing last night?

432
00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:54.064
Stop bugging me!

433
00:37:54.064 --> 00:37:55.023
Why won't you tell us?

434
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:56.149
Leave me alone!

435
00:37:56.358 --> 00:37:57.693
"Jellinek: exit"

436
00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:00.445
He's definitely hiding something.

437
00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:06.201
- Who else could it be?
- I don't know.

438
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:08.036
I know someone like that.

439
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.705
Someone annoying.

440
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.707
She always says. "You hurt me."

441
00:38:11.832 --> 00:38:13.208
Yeah. Maybe it's her.

442
00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:14.626
A woman?

443
00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:16.712
I was at a birthday party.

444
00:38:16.712 --> 00:38:17.921
Birthday party?

445
00:38:17.921 --> 00:38:19.339
For my husband.

446
00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:23.969
A lot of preparing but my daughters
helped me bake the cake.

447
00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:26.054
I'm looking at your Instagram.

448
00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:28.557
- Are you?
- You have a lovely family.

449
00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:33.353
Are you sure I'm the ideal housewife
for your article?

450
00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:37.107
Absolutely. Please share your
happiness with our readers.

451
00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:40.193
We'll be in touch.

452
00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:42.487
She doesn't seem like a bad person.

453
00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:44.531
She was lying through her teeth.

454
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:46.825
No family. No homemade cake.

455
00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:51.788
She's been living off Amazon
and Uber Eats for months.

456
00:38:51.788 --> 00:38:55.000
All her photos are stock photos.

457
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.753
Even this and this and this.

458
00:38:57.753 --> 00:39:00.088
Unbelievable. Why would she do this?

459
00:39:00.297 --> 00:39:02.966
No alibi. Very aggressive.

460
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:06.219
If her posts are hinting about those bruises...

461
00:39:06.887 --> 00:39:08.930
she could be the Beast.

462
00:39:15.645 --> 00:39:20.275
Fox. an MLB heavy hitter
who played in this year's World Series.

463
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.863
Rumor has it that this superstar
has a terrible secret.

464
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:25.989
Secret?

465
00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:30.369
About him being a violent man
wearing a gentleman's mask.

466
00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:35.248
He always keeps his top on
to hide all the scars on his body.

467
00:39:35.582 --> 00:39:39.127
Every superstar has a skeleton in his closet

468
00:39:39.252 --> 00:39:42.839
that disillusions us time and time again.

469
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.634
Hi. I'm Gogo Doggo.

470
00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:46.968
I'm Mr. Reggsignation.

471
00:39:47.094 --> 00:39:48.470
- Have you heard?
- About what?

472
00:39:48.595 --> 00:39:51.139
There's an AS popular with children.

473
00:39:51.264 --> 00:39:52.474
More popular than me?!

474
00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:53.392
You're popular?

475
00:39:53.517 --> 00:39:55.268
Who?! Who is it?!

476
00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:57.979
The Dragon.

477
00:39:58.105 --> 00:39:59.606
I thought everybody hated him.

478
00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:01.983
His hideout is called The Castle.

479
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:04.611
Everybody's looking for it.

480
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:06.154
Then what?

481
00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:08.740
- I want a selfie with him.
- A handshake.

482
00:40:08.865 --> 00:40:10.158
I thought he was a bad guy.

483
00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:11.451
Silent and cool.

484
00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:13.370
He's quiet but strong.

485
00:40:13.495 --> 00:40:14.830
Aren't you afraid of him?

486
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:18.750
The Dragon is... my hero.

487
00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:20.961
Hero...

488
00:40:23.463 --> 00:40:26.007
It's just me and my boys.

489
00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:29.261
They don't have a mother but they're happy.

490
00:40:29.803 --> 00:40:33.056
We get along great and enjoy life...

491
00:40:35.976 --> 00:40:38.061
He's an old homie of mine.

492
00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:40.021
We just clicked.

493
00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.858
He's actually filthy rich.

494
00:40:42.983 --> 00:40:46.778
Click here if you want to know
where his mansion is.

495
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.905
Who's the Dragon?

496
00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:50.449
Who is he?

497
00:40:50.991 --> 00:40:52.325
What's his real identity?

498
00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:53.785
Who is he?

499
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:02.335
Mrs. Tsutsui. two lunch specials!

500
00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:03.837
Okay.

501
00:41:04.671 --> 00:41:07.048
It's definitely not a publicity stunt.

502
00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:11.219
I'm still mourning for a loved one
who died in an accident.

503
00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:14.306
I put the tattoos where my lover was scarred.

504
00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:18.393
I guess everybody has a secret.

505
00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:22.898
They disclose a small secret
to protect a bigger one.

506
00:41:23.023 --> 00:41:24.065
You're a cynic.

507
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:28.069
We have to find out what he's
really trying to hide.

508
00:41:28.195 --> 00:41:29.905
Everybody has a secret.

509
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.072
You too.

510
00:41:31.198 --> 00:41:32.574
- And you.
- Me?

511
00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:34.075
I have no secrets.

512
00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:37.579
Your phone's wallpaper is a photo of Mr. Terada.

513
00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:40.582
- The physics teacher.
- Shush! Not here!

514
00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:42.125
Here you go.

515
00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:47.547
I'm just a face in the crowd to him.

516
00:41:48.048 --> 00:41:50.425
Don't tell my parents.

517
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.094
They think I'm a good girl.

518
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.221
I won't say anything.

519
00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:57.599
If my mom found out. she'd just die.

520
00:41:57.724 --> 00:41:59.518
Like the other day...

521
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:04.731
Sorry.

522
00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:05.649
It's okay.

523
00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:06.983
I am so sorry.

524
00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:13.073
Forget it. I was just thinking how you
actually talk to your parents.

525
00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:15.951
After my mom died.

526
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:19.538
it's been just me and my dad.
but we hardly ever talk.

527
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.961
I know. That's why I'm here for you.

528
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.301
Stop moping and eat!

529
00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:35.637
Two noodles. please!

530
00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:36.930
Coming up.

531
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.160
A castle in this isolated place?

532
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.495
I'm right this time.

533
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.497
Why won't you come with me?

534
00:43:02.622 --> 00:43:04.165
Extra lesson with Mr. Terada.

535
00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:05.584
Please...

536
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.631
Are you looking for something?

537
00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:13.633
Who are you?

538
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:16.303
I'm an AI. I know everything.

539
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.179
I'm looking for a castle.

540
00:43:18.305 --> 00:43:19.639
I thought so.

541
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:25.478
Here?

542
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.693
Are you lost?

543
00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.361
I'm looking for a castle.

544
00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:36.865
I thought so. I'll tell you. only you.

545
00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.502
Are you lost?

546
00:43:50.837 --> 00:43:54.966
You're looking for the castle. right?
Don't tell anyone else.

547
00:43:55.342 --> 00:43:56.384
Wait!

548
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:00.388
Where am I? I can't see a thing.

549
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:03.683
They were lying to you.

550
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.312
You'll never find it.

551
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:12.275
Play with me instead.
Follow me down this path.

552
00:44:24.037 --> 00:44:24.996
The castle.

553
00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:32.420
Is anyone here?

554
00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:33.546
Hurry.

555
00:44:36.049 --> 00:44:38.885
- She's here.
- We tried to stop her.

556
00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:45.308
- We're in trouble.
- Master won't like this.

557
00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:54.109
They're beautiful.

558
00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:56.778
I grew them. The secret roses.

559
00:44:57.404 --> 00:44:58.530
Secret?

560
00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:01.741
What secret?

561
00:45:03.243 --> 00:45:04.994
What are you doing here?

562
00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:10.458
You entered without permission.

563
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.794
Um... I followed him...

564
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:14.462
Leave.

565
00:45:14.587 --> 00:45:16.589
- But...
- Get out of here!

566
00:45:23.179 --> 00:45:24.055
Wait.

567
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.226
I want to ask you something. Who are you?

568
00:45:30.603 --> 00:45:31.980
Please answer me.

569
00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:34.441
Leave or I'll bite your head off.

570
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:48.037
Where are you going?

571
00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:00.300
Wait.

572
00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:02.719
Wait.

573
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.310
Trouble? Are we in trouble?

574
00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:11.936
No. Don't worry.

575
00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:14.689
Everything's okay.

576
00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:17.650
Which?

577
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:21.821
Which is the real you?

578
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:29.496
Wait!

579
00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:32.165
Stop!

580
00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:44.427
Suzu is in love.

581
00:46:45.094 --> 00:46:46.930
With a bad boy.

582
00:46:47.555 --> 00:46:49.432
No! Why?

583
00:46:49.432 --> 00:46:50.809
It's written on your face.

584
00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:54.229
Teenagers are attracted to bad boys.

585
00:46:54.354 --> 00:46:56.231
"Lonely and kind underneath."

586
00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:58.483
"I'm the only one who understands him."

587
00:46:59.025 --> 00:47:00.527
I said no!

588
00:47:01.027 --> 00:47:03.446
Why don't you give him a present?

589
00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:07.408
I studied abroad in Ohio
my senior year in high school.

590
00:47:07.534 --> 00:47:12.413
There was a guy with razor-sharp eyes
who was always alone.

591
00:47:12.539 --> 00:47:14.415
A lone wolf?

592
00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:16.584
I was kind of interested in him.

593
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:19.337
so I gave him a birthday present.

594
00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:20.713
What did you give him?

595
00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:21.840
A song.

596
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.966
Song?!

597
00:47:22.966 --> 00:47:26.761
I wrote a song and sang it to him.

598
00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:29.055
- That's so sweet.
- A love song.

599
00:47:29.055 --> 00:47:33.059
I saw him smile for the first time.
He said he was happy.

600
00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:35.061
- Did you guys go out?
- No.

601
00:47:35.061 --> 00:47:35.895
Why not?

602
00:47:35.895 --> 00:47:38.439
He was still in 8th grade.

603
00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:42.610
- Unbelievable.
- 8th grade?

604
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:47.240
I was touched when he
cried seeing me off at the airport.

605
00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:52.245
I've never written a love song...

606
00:48:21.107 --> 00:48:30.617
You want to be left alone

607
00:48:32.452 --> 00:48:38.458
Or that's what you'll say

608
00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:44.297
trying to push me away

609
00:48:45.048 --> 00:48:55.558
But the truth is you don't want me to look

610
00:48:58.978 --> 00:49:09.322
to see what's in your heart

611
00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:15.745
I guess I'll record it.

612
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.167
What?

613
00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:24.587
So many texts.

614
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:28.549
They were holding hands.

615
00:49:28.675 --> 00:49:30.718
- Her and Shinobu?
- Why?

616
00:49:30.843 --> 00:49:33.721
- They're childhood friends.
- That's no excuse.

617
00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:35.765
She thinks she's better than us.

618
00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:37.475
What's going on?!

619
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.729
- Suzu!
- Hiro!

620
00:49:41.854 --> 00:49:43.898
Did you ask Shinobu out?

621
00:49:44.023 --> 00:49:45.233
- No!
- Did he ask you out?

622
00:49:45.358 --> 00:49:46.401
Of course not!

623
00:49:46.526 --> 00:49:47.318
Then why?

624
00:49:47.652 --> 00:49:49.237
He held my hand...

625
00:49:49.362 --> 00:49:50.405
You held hands?!

626
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.407
No! He just grabbed my hand.

627
00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:56.577
That's all? But it's going viral.
It shows how popular he is.

628
00:49:56.703 --> 00:49:58.913
They have their eyes on him.

629
00:49:59.038 --> 00:50:00.581
I didn't do anything.

630
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:03.251
It's spreading like wildfire.

631
00:50:03.376 --> 00:50:09.048
They're lashing out.
venting their pent-up feelings.

632
00:50:09.215 --> 00:50:11.426
So much tension. Scary.

633
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:14.429
I thought they were all friends.

634
00:50:14.554 --> 00:50:16.097
I guess you never know.

635
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.684
An all-out war if they continue to show
their true colors.

636
00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:20.935
What should we do?

637
00:50:21.894 --> 00:50:25.898
I'll figure out the critical path to
extinguish the fire.

638
00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:28.568
You talk to the reasonable girls.

639
00:50:28.818 --> 00:50:29.902
I'll try.

640
00:50:30.987 --> 00:50:32.071
Listen!

641
00:50:32.697 --> 00:50:33.823
Nothing happened!

642
00:50:34.574 --> 00:50:36.617
He'd never date me.

643
00:50:36.743 --> 00:50:37.452
That's true.

644
00:50:37.577 --> 00:50:40.079
- Calm down.
- Chill.

645
00:50:42.832 --> 00:50:44.417
"Truce"

646
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:48.671
Hello!

647
00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:53.760
We're out of the lion's den.

648
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.137
Sorry... Sorry...

649
00:50:56.262 --> 00:50:58.097
It's a cruel world.

650
00:50:58.097 --> 00:51:01.142
All hell broke loose because it was you.

651
00:51:01.142 --> 00:51:05.313
No one would have reacted like this
if it were Luka.

652
00:51:07.398 --> 00:51:08.608
It's from Luka.

653
00:51:09.067 --> 00:51:10.318
"Sorry for the sudden text."

654
00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:12.361
"Can we talk?"

655
00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:16.115
The timing's too perfect.
Why would she text you now?

656
00:51:16.449 --> 00:51:17.533
What do you mean?

657
00:51:17.784 --> 00:51:19.619
Maybe she's behind this.

658
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:21.746
Definitely not!

659
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:23.539
She must be after Shinobu.

660
00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:26.584
Why would a pretty girl like her do this?

661
00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:29.087
She kind of gets on my nerves.

662
00:51:29.087 --> 00:51:31.589
She wanted my opinion as his childhood friend.

663
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:34.759
I would've ignored her. I'm not that nice.

664
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.474
I can't shake it off...

665
00:51:54.153 --> 00:51:55.655
He's practicing hard.

666
00:51:55.822 --> 00:51:57.824
Yeah. he is.

667
00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:02.912
Shinobu...

668
00:52:02.912 --> 00:52:05.498
He's taking so damn long.

669
00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:11.629
Suzu. did something happen today?

670
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.174
You can tell me.

671
00:52:18.511 --> 00:52:23.349
There's something I wanted to
ask you for a long time.

672
00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:25.226
What is it?

673
00:52:25.518 --> 00:52:26.519
You see...

674
00:52:28.104 --> 00:52:30.106
Um... Um...

675
00:52:32.608 --> 00:52:34.861
Suzu! Heading home?!

676
00:52:34.861 --> 00:52:38.698
I just finished practicing.
I'm wiped out.

677
00:52:39.866 --> 00:52:41.159
Huh? What's up?

678
00:52:41.534 --> 00:52:45.371
Kamishin... How was the away match?

679
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:49.167
I went and raced. But guess what happened!

680
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:54.422
A coach from my top college pick
was there to watch the match.

681
00:52:54.547 --> 00:52:56.215
I was so pumped.

682
00:52:56.382 --> 00:53:00.386
But I was totally off my game.
My results sucked.

683
00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:02.555
Look.

684
00:53:02.889 --> 00:53:08.186
I felt guilty about the guys who
didn't qualify for the nationals.

685
00:53:08.561 --> 00:53:10.980
You qualified for the nationals?

686
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:14.400
- Yeah.
- Seriously?!

687
00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:16.944
That's awesome! I'm rooting for you!

688
00:53:17.737 --> 00:53:18.905
Rooting for me?

689
00:53:20.573 --> 00:53:24.076
Shinobu. if she's rooting for me...

690
00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:25.745
Does it mean...

691
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:29.999
Suzu has a small crush on me?

692
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:35.796
What? No? No. huh?

693
00:53:35.796 --> 00:53:37.757
Go put that way. you idiot.

694
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:40.927
I was just kidding. Suzu.

695
00:53:40.927 --> 00:53:42.303
Thanks for your support.

696
00:53:42.637 --> 00:53:44.889
- Get outta here.
- Yeah. yeah.

697
00:53:54.774 --> 00:53:57.985
So what were you about to say?

698
00:53:58.736 --> 00:53:59.820
Forget it.

699
00:53:59.946 --> 00:54:01.572
- Holding something back?
- No.

700
00:54:01.948 --> 00:54:02.949
Are you sure?

701
00:54:03.783 --> 00:54:04.784
Yeah.

702
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:17.296
You don't have to waste your time
worrying about me anymore.

703
00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:20.967
Suzu!

704
00:54:24.971 --> 00:54:26.806
I don't know what to do.

705
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:35.690
"Luka"

706
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.864
"Please feel free to talk. I'm here for you."

707
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:46.367
"Thanks. Suzu!"

708
00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:48.577
"What a surprise."

709
00:54:48.577 --> 00:54:49.745
"I feel encouraged."

710
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.708
A woman?

711
00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:53.642
Bruises.

712
00:55:58.397 --> 00:55:59.398
Don't touch me.

713
00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:00.941
I'm sorry. Those bruises...

714
00:56:01.067 --> 00:56:02.401
You think they're ugly?

715
00:56:02.777 --> 00:56:03.486
No!

716
00:56:03.736 --> 00:56:05.279
Do those bruises hurt?

717
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.156
I'm sure they do. I...

718
00:56:07.281 --> 00:56:08.908
You don't know anything!

719
00:56:09.075 --> 00:56:10.743
Then explain it to me.

720
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:13.913
Just... Go away!

721
00:56:23.798 --> 00:56:25.800
Go away!

722
00:56:37.186 --> 00:56:38.229
Stop.

723
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.483
What were you doing here?

724
00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:44.068
Did you see someone?

725
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:46.487
An ugly monster?

726
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:56.038
Are you Belle?

727
00:56:56.622 --> 00:56:57.915
Why are you here?

728
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.127
You won't say?

729
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:03.462
Then...

730
00:57:05.673 --> 00:57:08.759
I'll ask your Origin.

731
00:57:12.972 --> 00:57:14.098
Beast!

732
00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:15.975
- It's him!
- Get him!

733
00:57:30.197 --> 00:57:32.366
- He's scared.
- What a wimp.

734
00:57:46.338 --> 00:57:47.631
We'll crash!

735
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:57.433
Where did the Beast go?!

736
00:57:59.018 --> 00:57:59.894
Beast!

737
00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:09.945
Stay away.

738
00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:12.490
Leave me alone.

739
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:32.593
I think I know you better now.

740
00:58:34.887 --> 00:58:38.349
This is where it really hurts. right?

741
00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:43.062
Thanks for saving me.

742
00:58:45.523 --> 00:58:46.524
Belle...

743
00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:50.027
Master!

744
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:07.628
You want to be left alone

745
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:19.014
Or that's what you'll say. as you push me away

746
00:59:19.807 --> 00:59:29.483
But the truth is you don't want me to look

747
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:38.951
to see what's in your heart

748
00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:45.374
Anger. fear. sorrow

749
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:51.505
Some nights it can be too much

750
00:59:52.298 --> 01:00:00.889
Yet you keep it all to yourself

751
01:00:01.724 --> 01:00:05.561
Lend me your voice

752
01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:14.612
The voice you try so hard to hide

753
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:19.867
Open the door

754
01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:27.374
Open up and let me see the heart

755
01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:30.169
that hides inside

756
01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.712
The secret rose.

757
01:00:56.028 --> 01:01:07.748
I can make it on my own

758
01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:15.714
Or that's what you'll say

759
01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:21.637
It's something you told yourself

760
01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:27.810
time and time again

761
01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:35.901
those lonesome nights

762
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:42.032
But I want to see you

763
01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:49.665
I want to see the real you

764
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:57.923
That's all that's been on my mind

765
01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:06.557
Lend me your voice

766
01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:14.356
Show me the face that you try so hard to hide

767
01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:19.737
Open the door

768
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:28.203
Open up and let me see the heart that hides inside

769
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:32.833
Call out the words

770
01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:41.508
Anything you want to say.
I'll be right here. I'll listen to the end

771
01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:46.305
Let me inside

772
01:02:47.181 --> 01:03:05.407
Let me come and sit right next to your heart

773
01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:21.215
What's happening?

774
01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.259
Don't look at me.

775
01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:29.640
Who are you?

776
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.278
"Isn't Belle doing another concert?"

777
01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.113
"Why won't she sing?"

778
01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.033
"She must be afraid."

779
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.368
"It's the Beast's fault."

780
01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:51.203
"He should be unveiled."

781
01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.205
Let's leave him alone.

782
01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.999
We don't have to know his secret.

783
01:03:56.083 --> 01:04:00.671
It's not just us
U isn't just a small chat room for classmates.

784
01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.632
- "Scumbag"
- Nobody can stop it.

785
01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.052
The Beast threatens order in U.

786
01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:12.349
Contact us with any info
on the Beast at #UnveilTheBeast.

787
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.685
He must be an old fart!

788
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:17.020
He's a young genius gamer!

789
01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.898
He's a she. a sexy bombshell.

790
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.276
I heard he's a billionaire.

791
01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:25.362
I'm suing him for mental distress from our match.

792
01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.948
Jellinek. a new lover already?

793
01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:28.949
He's amazing.

794
01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.701
I'm not dead.

795
01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:31.952
I guess not.

796
01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:34.329
I never said it was my girlfriend who died!

797
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:37.875
He got his tattoos to
imitate the Beast's bruises.

798
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.585
She's lying!

799
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:40.919
He's a con artist.

800
01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.379
Shut up. loser.

801
01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:43.463
What?!

802
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:45.924
Plagiarism? Absolutely not!

803
01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:51.471
People think I have a secret
because I don't show my skin.

804
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:56.643
The other day.
someone in U accused me of being the Beast.

805
01:04:56.935 --> 01:05:00.522
But I'm not a villain nor a violent man.

806
01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:04.902
I want to be a true hero for the children.

807
01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:13.869
Don't be shocked.

808
01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:18.832
I was very sick when I was little
and had several major surgeries.

809
01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.711
But I became healthy enough to play baseball.

810
01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:26.757
All you kids watching this.
don't give up on your dream.

811
01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:30.093
I hope this message comes across the right way.

812
01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.806
So who's the Beast?

813
01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.475
Unforgivable!

814
01:05:37.643 --> 01:05:39.686
Downright unforgivable!

815
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:43.023
I refuse to forgive anybody who hurts me!

816
01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.817
Are you that ideal housewife?

817
01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:47.986
Why a baby?

818
01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.031
Because I have an innocent heart.

819
01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:52.240
I don't believe you.

820
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:56.787
You think a cute baby can get away with anything.

821
01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:00.832
Shut up! She hurt me!

822
01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.670
Is it true Belle will sing again?

823
01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:06.129
It's just a rumor.

824
01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.673
I heard she's gonna surprise us.

825
01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:09.174
It's not true.

826
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.677
But what if it is?

827
01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:25.816
Where did Belle go?

828
01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:27.526
Belle!

829
01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:34.074
Do you know why this light
is the power of justice?

830
01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:39.371
Normally. the biometric information
scanned by the device

831
01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:43.166
is converted to the AS
through a specialized process.

832
01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:46.837
This light completely invalidates the conversion.

833
01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:51.550
The Origin of the AS is projected here in U.

834
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.802
This is how "unveil" works.

835
01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:59.975
It means I have the same power only the Voices.
U's creators. have.

836
01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:04.271
Have you ever wondered why

837
01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:08.066
there are no police in the Internet?

838
01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:11.153
Why is there no law enforcement in U

839
01:07:11.153 --> 01:07:14.031
when it's so similar to the real world?

840
01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:17.784
It's a good question. Everybody wants to know why.

841
01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:23.874
But the Voices insist we already have
everything we need for a fair society.

842
01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:28.170
We disagree. Every society has its villains.

843
01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:31.006
Those who cause trouble and disrupt order.

844
01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:34.301
Those who do as they please
and scoff at the world.

845
01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:37.012
We need the power to fight it.

846
01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:39.556
We need justice no matter where we are.

847
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:43.769
We need the power to crush evil.
And that power is us!

848
01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.814
The Beast... The ugly Beast.

849
01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:52.778
He must be unveiled for the future of U.

850
01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.112
That said...

851
01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.783
Why are you always with him?

852
01:07:58.575 --> 01:07:59.659
Why?

853
01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:03.538
Tell me where he is or face the consequences.

854
01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:06.500
If you don't...

855
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:11.254
I'll unveil you right here and now.

856
01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:16.718
I wouldn't tell you even if I knew.

857
01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:17.511
What?

858
01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:19.096
You don't care about justice.

859
01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:22.599
You just want to control other people.

860
01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:24.017
So I'm not telling you.

861
01:08:28.146 --> 01:08:31.399
I won't let you make a fool of me anymore.

862
01:08:31.525 --> 01:08:34.152
You think I can't unveil you?

863
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.530
Why don't we try?

864
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:39.157
Let's see the identity of the world-famous diva.

865
01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:42.702
The real face underneath the beautiful mask.

866
01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:46.832
I can just imagine it. You're probably...

867
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.417
When the truth is revealed

868
01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:54.131
who would pay any attention to your songs?

869
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.343
If you don't want that. tell me who he is!

870
01:08:58.343 --> 01:08:59.886
Where he is!

871
01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.721
Are you looking for something?

872
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.807
I'll tell you. only you.

873
01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:05.100
What?!

874
01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.811
Don't tell anyone else.

875
01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:11.523
Buzz off!

876
01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:21.867
Damn it!

877
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.391
Thanks for saving me.

878
01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:48.226
I'm glad you're okay.

879
01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:54.733
He's in danger.

880
01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:57.110
I have to help him.

881
01:09:58.028 --> 01:09:59.404
I have to protect him.

882
01:10:00.906 --> 01:10:01.948
Suzu.

883
01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.245
What?

884
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.164
If you're in trouble...

885
01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:10.290
I'm not.

886
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.875
You can tell me anything.

887
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.251
There's nothing to tell!

888
01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.471
"Have a peach from Mr. Matsuda. Dad"

889
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.269
Suzu.

890
01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:36.316
Luka.

891
01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:42.280
I couldn't do it.

892
01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:46.993
Your text gave me the courage to try.

893
01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:51.081
But I just froze in front of the guy I like.

894
01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:54.459
Then he said. "What's wrong with you?"

895
01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.961
"You're creeping me out."

896
01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:57.629
He did not.

897
01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:59.839
He did. But I don't blame him.

898
01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:04.052
I have no confidence. and I am pretty creepy.

899
01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:05.345
No way!

900
01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:08.682
Not at all! Shinobu is such a jerk!

901
01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:10.141
No.

902
01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.643
No? Then...

903
01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.145
It's Chikami.

904
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:15.522
Chikami?

905
01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.941
Shinjiro Chikami.

906
01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:19.693
Kamishin?!

907
01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.867
You're so cute.

908
01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.624
I know who you like.

909
01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.876
Don't say it. I'll die of embarrassment.

910
01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:39.045
Since when?

911
01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:46.261
When we were six. he said. "I'll protect you."

912
01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:50.598
I thought it was a marriage proposal.

913
01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:55.437
But he meant he'll protect me from bullies.

914
01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.981
He wasn't proposing. of course.

915
01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.151
After my mom died.

916
01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:04.362
I was always crying
and it scared my classmates away.

917
01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:09.075
He must have thought I was being bullied...

918
01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:15.999
This might sound weird

919
01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:21.463
but I always thought he
kind of acted like your mom.

920
01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:22.630
My mom?

921
01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:27.761
He worries about you for nothing
and asks how you're doing all the time.

922
01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:30.638
Shinobu isn't like other guys.

923
01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:33.850
I said his name.

924
01:12:36.728 --> 01:12:37.854
I'm dead.

925
01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:44.694
Take me to the elementary school you guys went to.

926
01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:46.363
I'll come again.

927
01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.451
Kamishin.

928
01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:53.578
Oh...

929
01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.714
I'm rooting for you.

930
01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:05.965
Rooting for me?

931
01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:07.550
Yes...

932
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.928
Rooting for me?

933
01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:15.225
Does that mean

934
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:20.105
you have a small crush on me?

935
01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:25.110
I'm kidding. It was a joke.

936
01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:28.113
What?

937
01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.197
Yes.

938
01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:35.495
What?!

939
01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:43.378
Why are you running away?

940
01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.588
This is all new to me.

941
01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.132
You heard her. didn't you?

942
01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:49.426
- Yeah.
- Aren't you happy?

943
01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:50.760
I am.

944
01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.321
Hey!

945
01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.323
I don't know what to say.

946
01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:15.618
How about "thank you" or "I'll do my best"?

947
01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:28.339
Luka...

948
01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:29.883
Yes?

949
01:14:30.592 --> 01:14:32.010
What's your hobby?

950
01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:35.346
Music. What kind do you like?

951
01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:38.224
I like Belle.

952
01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:39.559
Me too!

953
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:41.478
Really? Cool.

954
01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:44.606
I've always wished I could sing like her.

955
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.526
Don't laugh but people say I look like her.

956
01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:50.528
You totally do.

957
01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.197
She's much prettier...

958
01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:54.324
No. You totally look like her.

959
01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:57.577
Are you guys related or what?

960
01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:04.459
My family visits my grandfather
in Hakodate every summer.

961
01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:09.589
So... can I really go watch you
compete in the nationals?

962
01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:13.843
With you cheering me on

963
01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:17.180
I'll definitely win. Watch me.

964
01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:26.648
That was close. I hope it works out for them.

965
01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:27.774
Suzu!

966
01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:31.194
Did you see Kamishin?

967
01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:33.571
Yes. I mean. no...

968
01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.198
- Which?
- Yes.

969
01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:36.991
- No.
- Which?

970
01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:48.461
Suzu. there's something I couldn't tell you.

971
01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:50.588
Suzu.

972
01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:55.051
I'm sorry! Me too.
I also have something to tell you.

973
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:56.970
Yeah.

974
01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:59.013
You see... I...

975
01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.014
I know.

976
01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.933
I'm...

977
01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:03.768
You're Belle. right?

978
01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:08.064
Belle is you. right?

979
01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:11.859
Suzu.

980
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:14.070
You're wrong!

981
01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:15.363
Suzu!

982
01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:16.573
No!

983
01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.497
Suzu. where did you go? Suzu?!

984
01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:31.129
What do I do now?!

985
01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:34.841
How will I tell him...?

986
01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:43.474
The Dragon is in trouble!

987
01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:53.484
His castle...

988
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:55.737
- They finally...
- Found it.

989
01:17:01.326 --> 01:17:05.830
We will show no mercy!
The Beast's Origin will be revealed!

990
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.379
We will make him pay for his sins
in front of everyone in U!

991
01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:20.720
The Dragon's Origin will be unveiled.

992
01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:22.055
Who is he?

993
01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.348
Everyone wants to know.

994
01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:25.683
I heard he's a psycho killer.

995
01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.478
A crooked businessman who evades taxes.

996
01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:30.855
Get lost. Beast.

997
01:17:31.022 --> 01:17:33.024
The Beast is totally worthless.

998
01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:35.276
He might as well disappear.

999
01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.153
Dragon. you watching this?

1000
01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:38.237
I doubt it.

1001
01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.658
Kids around the world are cheering for you.

1002
01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.910
- You watching. Dragon?!
- No.

1003
01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.953
The Dragon is bullied by adults!

1004
01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:47.413
Poor Dragon.

1005
01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:49.040
Someone. help him.

1006
01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:51.167
Let's all cheer him on!

1007
01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.543
There's still time.

1008
01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.546
Cheer the Dragon on.

1009
01:17:56.339 --> 01:18:00.760
These idiots only have one-digit views!

1010
01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:02.804
- They have no influence.
- Get lost. Beast.

1011
01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:04.889
- They try too hard.
- You deserve it. Dragon!

1012
01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:06.808
At the old school!

1013
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.206
What happened?

1014
01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:35.211
Protect our master...

1015
01:18:41.134 --> 01:18:44.595
They refused to take us to the Beast.

1016
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.681
How could you do this?

1017
01:18:46.848 --> 01:18:49.267
They're just AI.

1018
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.477
He's not here.

1019
01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:54.856
Fine. Let's go.
We'll set this castle on fire.

1020
01:18:56.023 --> 01:19:00.570
He'll come scurrying out like a sewer rat.

1021
01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.866
Look behind you...

1022
01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:09.036
I'll tell you. only you...

1023
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.061
It's dangerous here but don't worry.

1024
01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:36.314
We'll leave together.

1025
01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:41.194
If I can endure it. everything will be okay.

1026
01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:42.820
What?

1027
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.492
Belle... I'm sorry I can't tell you the truth.

1028
01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.118
Wait!

1029
01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:50.453
Don't go!

1030
01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.862
Shinobu. check this out.

1031
01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:28.324
Things are going crazy in U.

1032
01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:31.869
- Suzu...
- Suzu?

1033
01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.704
Do you know where she went?

1034
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:34.872
No.

1035
01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:39.544
We were just talking about your
old elementary school.

1036
01:20:39.544 --> 01:20:41.546
Is it close by?

1037
01:20:44.549 --> 01:20:47.718
Shinobu... Huh? Luka?

1038
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.056
You're late!

1039
01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:53.516
Sorry!

1040
01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:56.644
An auto-search on anything that might be related.

1041
01:20:56.644 --> 01:21:00.064
We have to find his Origin
before Justin gets to him.

1042
01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:00.940
But how?

1043
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:05.194
How can we pinpoint one person out of 5 billion?

1044
01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:08.489
Where is he? Where did he go?

1045
01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:10.658
Where?

1046
01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:12.910
Where is he?

1047
01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:14.662
- It's Belle!
- Belle?

1048
01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:16.539
- For real?
- I knew she'd come.

1049
01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:18.249
How rare is this?!

1050
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.587
Stop it! I have to find him!

1051
01:21:23.004 --> 01:21:24.839
Let me go! Please!

1052
01:21:26.674 --> 01:21:27.925
Belle is gonna sing again!

1053
01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:29.760
The rumor was true!

1054
01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.178
We were waiting for you!

1055
01:21:31.304 --> 01:21:32.597
I wanna hear Belle's voice!

1056
01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:33.890
Sing for us!

1057
01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:38.561
Hey! There's no time! Let Belle go!

1058
01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.146
She's surrounded.

1059
01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:41.188
This is bad.

1060
01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.982
But if we go now...

1061
01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:44.901
She'll find out we knew.

1062
01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:45.985
But...

1063
01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:47.778
we should go.

1064
01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:52.825
Please let Belle go!

1065
01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:57.788
Think again carefully.
Who is he underneath the surface?

1066
01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.498
You hurt me!

1067
01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:03.920
Is he lonely like that woman?

1068
01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.464
Then...

1069
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:11.302
I put the tattoos where my lover was scarred.

1070
01:22:12.637 --> 01:22:15.306
But his bruises aren't tattoos.

1071
01:22:18.476 --> 01:22:20.645
I had several major surgeries.

1072
01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:23.981
But they weren't real scars either.

1073
01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.486
If the device scanned traces of physical pain

1074
01:22:28.653 --> 01:22:30.947
his real body might also be bruised.

1075
01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:32.823
But...

1076
01:22:34.492 --> 01:22:37.745
Why were his bruises throbbing?

1077
01:22:38.788 --> 01:22:43.834
And those child-like eyes that he showed me...

1078
01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.712
Child?

1079
01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.385
A kid's voice!

1080
01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:56.013
Only he and I know this song.

1081
01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:58.516
Where is it coming from?!

1082
01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:00.017
Suzu...

1083
01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.436
Where?! Where are you?!

1084
01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:21.580
I've seen him somewhere...

1085
01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:27.461
The Dragon is my hero.

1086
01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:30.089
It's just me and my boys.

1087
01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:33.551
They don't have a mother but they're happy.

1088
01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:35.302
We get along great...

1089
01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.264
Why does he know this song?

1090
01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:39.765
I'll zoom in.

1091
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.824
It's Belle.

1092
01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:03.247
So. is he the Dragon?

1093
01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:04.707
But something's off.

1094
01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:06.125
What do you mean?

1095
01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.794
I don't think it's him.

1096
01:24:08.961 --> 01:24:11.213
He doesn't seem to have any bruises.

1097
01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:19.180
Tomo. what's that song?

1098
01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:24.185
I'm working. Don't you
realize how distracting it is?

1099
01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:36.781
Why do you disobey me?

1100
01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:41.952
The world has rules and
I make the rules in this house.

1101
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:46.624
If you can't follow them. you're no good to me.

1102
01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.919
Do I have to repeat myself?

1103
01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.671
Do I have to do this?

1104
01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:54.799
Don't!

1105
01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:56.801
It's not Tomo's fault.

1106
01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:58.511
- Move!
- Stop it!

1107
01:24:58.511 --> 01:25:00.262
Get out of my way!

1108
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.890
Tomo. don't listen.

1109
01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:05.893
Who do you think feeds you?!

1110
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.979
It's my fault. okay? Not yours.

1111
01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:13.484
Kei. you're 14.
Why don't you understand already?

1112
01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.903
It's my fault.

1113
01:25:16.654 --> 01:25:19.031
What good are you?!

1114
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.243
Everything's my fault.

1115
01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:27.039
You should disappear. Go! Disappear!

1116
01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:29.708
You're worthless so disappear!

1117
01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:37.925
If I can endure it...

1118
01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:46.350
I found him. This boy...

1119
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:48.936
is him.

1120
01:26:08.539 --> 01:26:10.416
A poor excuse for a father...

1121
01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:15.212
Kei. are you okay? Kei...

1122
01:26:15.546 --> 01:26:18.132
I see. I think I understand.

1123
01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:22.052
Kei wanted to be a hero
to encourage Tomo.

1124
01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.346
I know why

1125
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:26.932
the Dragon is so strong.

1126
01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:31.604
Since U's body-sharing technology
reveals the hidden "you"

1127
01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:35.733
all this pain must be the source of his strength.

1128
01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.819
Like how Suzu became Belle...

1129
01:26:44.575 --> 01:26:45.659
"Accept"

1130
01:26:55.044 --> 01:26:56.337
Connected.

1131
01:26:58.923 --> 01:27:00.841
Can you see me?

1132
01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.345
Can you hear my voice?

1133
01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:08.015
I saw what happened.

1134
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.851
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1135
01:27:11.602 --> 01:27:14.647
I want to go see you.

1136
01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:17.274
Tell me where you are. I'll...

1137
01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:19.485
Who are you?

1138
01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:22.404
The first time in real life!

1139
01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:26.450
I'm... Belle.

1140
01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:28.619
- Belle?!
- Yeah right.

1141
01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:30.579
Connected.

1142
01:27:31.372 --> 01:27:32.456
See? I told you.

1143
01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.292
- Child abuse.
- Call the cops.

1144
01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.044
Should we?

1145
01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:45.386
Do you also laugh at
other people's secrets?

1146
01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:46.428
No.

1147
01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:49.974
Did you enjoy seeing how
miserable we are?

1148
01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:53.686
No! I want to help you.

1149
01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:58.399
That's why I called.
I want to help you.

1150
01:27:58.816 --> 01:28:00.359
Help? How?

1151
01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:06.240
Help. Help. Help.
I've heard it so many times.

1152
01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:10.286
"I'll talk to your father."
"I talked to your father."

1153
01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.830
"Your father understands now."

1154
01:28:12.997 --> 01:28:14.707
But nothing changed.

1155
01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:16.542
"I'll help you"?

1156
01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:20.129
What can you do?

1157
01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:25.009
Help. Help. Help. You don't know anything.

1158
01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:29.179
Help. Help. Help. Talk is easy.

1159
01:28:29.305 --> 01:28:34.226
"I want to help you guys."
"I want to change things for you."

1160
01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:37.980
You cry because you pity us.
You cry out of sympathy.

1161
01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:39.773
It doesn't change anything.

1162
01:28:42.276 --> 01:28:45.904
Help! Help! Help!

1163
01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:47.114
I'm sick of it!

1164
01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:49.116
Go away!

1165
01:28:52.536 --> 01:28:54.496
Kei! Come back!

1166
01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:55.664
It's disconnected.

1167
01:28:55.873 --> 01:28:57.333
Where are you?!

1168
01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.376
He doesn't trust you.

1169
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:03.213
He'll never tell you where he is.

1170
01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:06.675
What now?

1171
01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:24.777
Sing as Suzu.

1172
01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.738
Make room for Belle!

1173
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:43.087
Now watch. Her song will draw him out.

1174
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.840
He'll come like he did before.

1175
01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:48.300
I know he will.

1176
01:29:59.353 --> 01:30:00.729
Not as Belle.

1177
01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.857
Call out to him as Suzu.

1178
01:30:04.525 --> 01:30:06.068
Are you crazy?!

1179
01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:09.279
I think it's the only way to contact him again.

1180
01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:12.241
Do you know what you're saying?!

1181
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:15.994
Everything Suzu worked for
will go up in smoke!

1182
01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:19.415
It's the only way to gain his trust.

1183
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:22.876
Suzu! What have you been
doing all of this for?!

1184
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.838
Wanna go back to the old you?!

1185
01:30:25.838 --> 01:30:28.006
Wanna be a crybaby again?!

1186
01:30:28.257 --> 01:30:29.842
Is that what you want?!

1187
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:39.685
Their identities are revealed more or less.

1188
01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:43.605
What can you do for them wearing a mask?

1189
01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:47.484
How can you get through to them
if you're not yourself?

1190
01:30:58.287 --> 01:31:00.747
Hey! Why doesn't she sing?!

1191
01:31:17.848 --> 01:31:18.807
Sing!

1192
01:31:19.016 --> 01:31:21.560
Sing and draw out the ugly Beast!

1193
01:31:21.894 --> 01:31:23.020
Sing!

1194
01:31:25.564 --> 01:31:26.648
What?!

1195
01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.734
- Shine the light!
- What?!

1196
01:31:28.734 --> 01:31:30.944
Shine the light on me!

1197
01:31:35.032 --> 01:31:36.325
What's going on?

1198
01:31:36.325 --> 01:31:40.204
You're kidding! You want to be unveiled?!

1199
01:32:17.783 --> 01:32:18.992
What's that?!

1200
01:32:25.332 --> 01:32:27.084
Belle's Origin...

1201
01:32:30.337 --> 01:32:31.505
She looks so different.

1202
01:32:31.505 --> 01:32:33.131
Except the freckles.

1203
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.883
Belle's been unveiled!

1204
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.677
Who unveiled her?

1205
01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:38.554
She did!

1206
01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:40.639
Oh no!

1207
01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:43.267
Belle was unveiled?!

1208
01:32:43.392 --> 01:32:45.811
Weren't you listening? She did it herself.

1209
01:32:45.936 --> 01:32:47.145
- She did?
- Why?

1210
01:32:47.271 --> 01:32:48.397
For what?

1211
01:32:49.439 --> 01:32:52.609
Belle is just an ordinary girl...

1212
01:32:56.363 --> 01:32:58.991
Like me.

1213
01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:02.202
This was our secret!

1214
01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.832
Is this the music app?

1215
01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:09.835
- Don't!
- Suzu!

1216
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:21.305
Suzu. sing!

1217
01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:24.641
She can't sing as herself!

1218
01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:26.101
She can.

1219
01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:27.603
She can't!

1220
01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:29.396
- Suzu...
- Suzu...

1221
01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:31.732
- Will she sing?
- Suzu...

1222
01:33:40.324 --> 01:33:46.997
The flowers that sparkle

1223
01:33:47.414 --> 01:33:52.252
The gems of our dreams

1224
01:33:54.171 --> 01:34:03.972
This world is beautiful

1225
01:34:08.602 --> 01:34:14.858
Though fear and uncertainty

1226
01:34:15.359 --> 01:34:20.530
tie chains around my heart

1227
01:34:21.365 --> 01:34:32.709
I want to grow kind and strong

1228
01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:42.135
She's trembling.

1229
01:34:42.344 --> 01:34:44.346
The poor girl was unveiled.

1230
01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:50.352
Belle!

1231
01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:56.608
Without someone to love

1232
01:34:58.402 --> 01:35:06.368
what is there to live for?

1233
01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:13.333
Come back to me and stay by my side

1234
01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:20.340
I feel my heart shake. Come. ease the ache

1235
01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:27.472
I'm standing over here. reaching for you

1236
01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:34.688
A million miles away. come back and stay

1237
01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:41.862
It still makes no sense. what's our destiny?

1238
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:48.785
When I close my eyes. you're all that I see

1239
01:35:49.578 --> 01:35:55.459
Come back to me

1240
01:35:56.126 --> 01:36:03.508
A million miles away. come back and stay

1241
01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:02.609
Mom. don't go!

1242
01:37:03.276 --> 01:37:05.904
I have to or she'll die.

1243
01:39:14.324 --> 01:39:16.201
Suzu!

1244
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.706
Belle! Sing! Don't stop!

1245
01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:22.874
It's Peggie Sue.

1246
01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:24.084
The Peggie Sue?

1247
01:39:27.712 --> 01:39:29.381
Belle. sing!

1248
01:40:07.002 --> 01:40:10.714
Why won't she fade away when she was unveiled?

1249
01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:16.428
Damn it.

1250
01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.223
What's that?

1251
01:40:59.262 --> 01:41:04.934
Sing. let your heart soar! It brings us together!

1252
01:41:05.268 --> 01:41:11.149
So sad and so happy! The feelings flow over. now

1253
01:41:11.274 --> 01:41:16.946
Our world is full of all kinds of colors

1254
01:41:17.155 --> 01:41:22.869
Closing my eyes I still can see the stars

1255
01:41:23.244 --> 01:41:29.000
shine in the sky and soon the rising sun

1256
01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:35.173
Flowers. they're blooming. oh it's beautiful

1257
01:41:36.549 --> 01:41:37.675
Sing!

1258
01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:40.762
Sing!

1259
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.305
Sing!

1260
01:41:42.764 --> 01:41:47.811
Sing my song. never-ending

1261
01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:52.107
Sing it through. I love you

1262
01:41:53.066 --> 01:42:01.449
Always. forever

1263
01:42:27.308 --> 01:42:28.309
Wow...

1264
01:42:28.977 --> 01:42:33.356
Kei... I want to see Belle.

1265
01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:36.192
Is she really Belle?

1266
01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:40.446
I don't completely trust her yet. But...

1267
01:42:53.168 --> 01:42:54.711
Belle? Can you see us?

1268
01:42:56.171 --> 01:42:57.213
Belle?

1269
01:42:58.173 --> 01:42:59.215
Belle?

1270
01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:03.678
Yes!

1271
01:43:05.054 --> 01:43:06.181
Suzu.

1272
01:43:07.891 --> 01:43:09.642
Your feelings reached them.

1273
01:43:10.894 --> 01:43:12.061
Shinobu.

1274
01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:14.981
I'm so glad!

1275
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.984
So glad...

1276
01:43:26.242 --> 01:43:28.912
Why do you disobey me?

1277
01:43:29.996 --> 01:43:31.581
What's this?

1278
01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:34.709
Our address is...

1279
01:43:37.921 --> 01:43:38.963
That. huh?

1280
01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:40.381
No... Stop.

1281
01:43:40.506 --> 01:43:41.216
Move!

1282
01:43:42.926 --> 01:43:44.552
- You're in my way!
- Kei!

1283
01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:48.389
Screw you!

1284
01:43:53.269 --> 01:43:54.437
They're in trouble.

1285
01:43:54.562 --> 01:43:55.730
We have to protect them.

1286
01:43:55.855 --> 01:43:57.106
But where are they?

1287
01:43:57.232 --> 01:43:58.942
We didn't get their address.

1288
01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:02.445
I think there's a clue.

1289
01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:06.950
I heard the evening melody from the monitor.

1290
01:44:07.075 --> 01:44:08.117
Melody?

1291
01:44:08.243 --> 01:44:10.328
One was "The Sunset Glow"

1292
01:44:10.328 --> 01:44:12.538
and the other. "The Coconut."

1293
01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:15.124
The daily public announcement music.

1294
01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:16.292
Two of them?

1295
01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.544
They must be between two cities.

1296
01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:20.546
- Which ones?
- Let me check.

1297
01:44:20.922 --> 01:44:22.507
I have the recorded clip!

1298
01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:37.230
- She's right.
- Good ears.

1299
01:44:37.397 --> 01:44:40.692
What's that? Enlarge the window.

1300
01:44:42.068 --> 01:44:44.404
- Buildings?
- Apartment complex?

1301
01:44:44.529 --> 01:44:47.115
- Two of them?
- Find out where!

1302
01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.533
We need more info.

1303
01:44:48.658 --> 01:44:49.659
Wait.

1304
01:44:52.328 --> 01:44:54.998
Luka. I think I know where this is.

1305
01:44:55.999 --> 01:44:58.876
Hold on. Where was it?

1306
01:44:59.002 --> 01:45:00.169
Hurry up!

1307
01:45:00.837 --> 01:45:02.171
- Got it.
- Where is it?

1308
01:45:02.422 --> 01:45:07.677
Two tall buildings around Tokyo
between Ota Ward and Kawasaki City.

1309
01:45:07.802 --> 01:45:09.595
Is this it?!

1310
01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:14.267
It's a match!

1311
01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:15.393
Good job.

1312
01:45:15.685 --> 01:45:16.602
Yay!

1313
01:45:16.853 --> 01:45:20.940
I'm calling about children
who need immediate protection

1314
01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.735
in a neighborhood I'm about to describe.

1315
01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:26.362
Why not?

1316
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:28.197
Rules?

1317
01:45:29.032 --> 01:45:33.703
But what if something happens in 48 hours?

1318
01:45:34.037 --> 01:45:35.204
I have to go.

1319
01:45:35.538 --> 01:45:36.539
Suzu!

1320
01:45:37.373 --> 01:45:38.416
I'll drive you to the station.

1321
01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:39.292
Suzu!

1322
01:45:47.633 --> 01:45:49.552
No more flights.

1323
01:45:49.552 --> 01:45:51.804
Should we drive her to Tokyo?

1324
01:45:58.227 --> 01:45:59.896
Is she okay by herself?

1325
01:46:00.021 --> 01:46:01.898
It was her decision.

1326
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:11.449
Dad. I left without saying anything but

1327
01:46:11.449 --> 01:46:13.409
I'm on my way to somewhere far away.

1328
01:46:16.621 --> 01:46:19.415
I got a message from the choir ladies.

1329
01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:22.335
Sorry I'm always so selfish.

1330
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.961
You must have your reasons.

1331
01:46:24.754 --> 01:46:27.256
Someone important to me is in trouble.

1332
01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:32.136
You're trying to help that person.

1333
01:46:32.553 --> 01:46:37.433
But I don't know what I can do.

1334
01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:42.105
You...

1335
01:46:43.773 --> 01:46:47.693
You've been so sad since your mom died.

1336
01:46:48.945 --> 01:46:50.905
You suffered so much.

1337
01:46:52.698 --> 01:46:54.409
It's been tough for you.

1338
01:46:55.868 --> 01:47:00.331
But you've grown to be such a caring girl.

1339
01:47:01.624 --> 01:47:04.085
You understand how people feel.

1340
01:47:07.296 --> 01:47:10.508
Suzu... You...

1341
01:47:12.051 --> 01:47:17.682
became the kind girl that you are
because your mom raised you.

1342
01:47:21.227 --> 01:47:25.356
Be kind to that person.

1343
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:31.154
"Thanks"

1344
01:48:21.579 --> 01:48:23.372
- This is it.
- Belle?

1345
01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:27.919
You came?

1346
01:48:28.211 --> 01:48:29.212
Tomo!

1347
01:48:30.379 --> 01:48:31.380
Belle!

1348
01:48:38.638 --> 01:48:42.058
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

1349
01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:46.062
Are you really Belle?

1350
01:48:57.907 --> 01:48:59.075
Where are you?!

1351
01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:02.370
Kei! Tomo!

1352
01:49:03.538 --> 01:49:06.541
You left without my permission.

1353
01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:10.294
Who are you?!

1354
01:49:10.419 --> 01:49:13.589
Did you make that post on the Internet?!

1355
01:49:13.798 --> 01:49:14.840
How dare you!

1356
01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:26.269
Kei! Tomo! Go back inside!
Why won't you listen to me?!

1357
01:49:26.561 --> 01:49:30.189
I'm your father! You'll do as I say!

1358
01:49:30.439 --> 01:49:32.900
Damn you little brat!

1359
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:35.444
Trying to tear apart our family?!

1360
01:49:37.613 --> 01:49:38.906
I won't let you!

1361
01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:42.493
Unforgivable!

1362
01:50:45.181 --> 01:50:46.223
Belle.

1363
01:50:50.061 --> 01:50:52.396
I knew when you hugged me.

1364
01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.524
You really are Belle.

1365
01:50:57.526 --> 01:50:59.153
Thank you for coming.

1366
01:50:59.987 --> 01:51:03.532
I really wanted you to come.

1367
01:51:06.035 --> 01:51:08.329
I wanted to meet you. Belle.

1368
01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:11.040
Me too.

1369
01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:26.514
I watched you take a stand
and realized I have to too.

1370
01:51:26.722 --> 01:51:28.808
So I'm gonna fight.

1371
01:51:31.143 --> 01:51:33.604
I learned from you too.

1372
01:51:33.729 --> 01:51:38.109
You set my heart free from fear.

1373
01:51:39.235 --> 01:51:40.361
Thanks.

1374
01:51:43.489 --> 01:51:45.282
I love you. Belle.

1375
01:51:46.992 --> 01:51:48.035
Thanks.

1376
01:51:48.494 --> 01:51:51.038
Belle. you're amazing.

1377
01:51:51.997 --> 01:51:53.958
You're beautiful.

1378
01:52:09.098 --> 01:52:13.519
U is another reality. AS is another you.

1379
01:52:14.019 --> 01:52:16.772
You can live as another you.

1380
01:52:17.106 --> 01:52:20.067
You can start a new life.

1381
01:52:20.776 --> 01:52:23.362
You can change the world.

1382
01:52:46.135 --> 01:52:48.220
You want dinner tonight?

1383
01:52:50.973 --> 01:52:52.057
Yeah.

1384
01:52:54.477 --> 01:52:56.061
Let's have seafood.

1385
01:52:58.481 --> 01:52:59.356
I'm back.

1386
01:53:01.317 --> 01:53:02.318
Welcome home.

1387
01:53:03.444 --> 01:53:04.612
Suzu!

1388
01:53:05.738 --> 01:53:07.448
Welcome back!

1389
01:53:18.834 --> 01:53:20.002
Suzu.

1390
01:53:21.170 --> 01:53:24.924
I saw you protect those kids. You did good.

1391
01:53:26.091 --> 01:53:27.384
You were real cool.

1392
01:53:33.599 --> 01:53:35.643
I'm finally free!

1393
01:53:36.268 --> 01:53:40.272
I'm done being your guardian.
We can just be normal friends.

1394
01:53:40.773 --> 01:53:42.650
It's what I always wanted.

1395
01:53:56.664 --> 01:53:57.790
Thank you.

1396
01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.892
Let's sing and walk.

1397
01:54:17.017 --> 01:54:19.270
Great idea. It'll be good practice.

1398
01:54:19.395 --> 01:54:20.938
For the concert.

1399
01:54:21.063 --> 01:54:22.106
What should we sing?

1400
01:54:22.231 --> 01:54:23.691
What else?

1401
01:54:23.816 --> 01:54:25.359
That song. right?

1402
01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:27.152
Suzu!

1403
01:54:28.821 --> 01:54:29.905
Take the lead.

1404
01:54:30.322 --> 01:54:31.490
Sing!

1405
01:54:34.535 --> 01:54:35.578
I'll listen.

1406
01:54:41.333 --> 01:54:42.543
Ready?

1407
01:54:44.253 --> 01:54:49.592
BELLE
