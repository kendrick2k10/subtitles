3
00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:22.556
Goddammit. see
that's the thing.

4
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.057
I also don't understand

5
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.025
when people say things like
Goddammit or Jesus Christ

6
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.528
for a curse.

7
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.128
No matter what religious
affiliation you come from.

8
00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.730
we can all agree
that Jesus Christ

9
00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.966
was like a really
good dude. right?

10
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.501
So like. why did we
say it as a curse?

11
00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.470
Why don't we replace
it with like.

12
00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.104
I don't know terrible people.

13
00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.407
You stub your toe. you're
like. "Oh. Adolf Hitler."

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.476
Or like you pour hot coffee
in your lap. you're like.

15
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.679
"Oh. oh. hot coffee.
Christopher Columbus."

16
00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:46.913
Christopher Columbus?

17
00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.349
Oh yeah. apparently
a really bad dude.

18
00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.251
We were completely misinformed
in elementary school.

19
00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:53.254
Oh. stupid guy
can't catch the ball.

20
00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.854
These pro athletes
get paid millions

21
00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.390
of dollars a year
to catch balls.

22
00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.891
You'd think their video game
avatars could do the same.

23
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.160
If I was a pro. I
would catch every pass.

24
00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.597
Oh yeah. just like you'd
make every single sale?

25
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.798
So why aren't you out there
making your millions then?

26
00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.701
Oh dude. you have no idea.

27
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:10.069
I have a mint idea in the works.

28
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.374
You put your kids in a car
seat and they are contained.

29
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.575
The nice. steady rocking

30
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.109
of your vehicle
knocks them right out.

31
00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.580
Kids always fall
asleep in the car.

32
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.686
And that is why I came
up with the bed seats.

33
00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.955
All you have to do is
strap your little spawn

34
00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.424
in with these restraints

35
00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.459
and they will never be
able to climb out of bed.

36
00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:36.796
and they will finally fall
asleep when you want them to.

37
00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.834
And as an added bonus. patent
pending car simulation.

38
00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:51.211
Obviously just a
prototype. oh.

39
00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.847
A couple more tweaks. those
things will sell like dog meat

40
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.216
at a Chinese wet market.

41
00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:58.519
I'm having an affair.

42
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.293
You're what?

43
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.530
I'm seeing another girl.

44
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:12.499
Just like in like a movie.
real world adult shit man.

45
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.734
I'm cheating on my wife.

46
00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.036
A little bam bam in the ham.

47
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.639
Bone storming the castle.

48
00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:21.208
Going to pound town
with another bunny.

49
00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:23.876
Pickle tickle by
another chicken.

50
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.180
Okay. okay wait.
going to pound town?

51
00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:29.182
This is the time to
try out that phase?

52
00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.621
You're serious?

53
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.889
Yeah. what do you think?

54
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.096
I think you're a
complete son of a.

55
00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:29.543
Oh no. it's just daddy.

56
00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:44.224
Ah. Saddam Hussein.

57
00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.794
- Hey babe.
- Hey.

58
00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.128
How was the game?

59
00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:54.934
The game. the
game was fantastic.

60
00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:56.637
I crushed it.

61
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.305
You would have
been so impressed.

62
00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:04.076
Matt however is the most
disappointing human being

63
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.747
I've ever met in my entire life.

64
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.614
Why?

65
00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.253
You promise not
to tell anyone?

66
00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.389
Sure.

67
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.457
You promise not
to tell anyone?

68
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.891
- Sure.
- Not even Jen.

69
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.398
Matt is putting his banana
into a different fruit salad.

70
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.099
What. he's cheating on Maddie?

71
00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.936
- Yep.
- Get out. does she know?

72
00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:32.239
- Nope.
- What about the kids?

73
00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.042
I don't think
they know either.

74
00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:39.646
Okay no. I mean like what
is gonna happen to them?

75
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.481
Those poor kids!

76
00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.015
This is all so crazy.

77
00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.084
I can't even process this.

78
00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:46.887
Yeah. I totally understand.

79
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.823
This is like beyond insane.

80
00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:53.360
My best friend got a
passport. packed his bags.

81
00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:57.264
purchased a ticket and flew
straight to pound town.

82
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.732
I'm sorry babe. it's rough.

83
00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.802
Can you turn on a
show or something?

84
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.437
I gotta get my mind off of this.

85
00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:38.005
Hey Chad. I'd like to buy this.

86
00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.276
Go ahead and scan it.

87
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.177
Excuse me?

88
00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.381
Grab a scanner and scan.

89
00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:50.250
Isn't that your job?

90
00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:00.227
$2.32.

91
00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:21.848
Can I get a bag please?

92
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.686
Sure.

93
00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:38.164
Wow. excellent
customer service dude.

94
00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:41.068
Thanks for shopping at
Big Jim's corner store!

95
00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:50.477
I've got some
potentially upsetting news.

96
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.845
Oh no. now what?

97
00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.447
Monthly promotion changed.

98
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.181
Ugh. you gotta be kidding me.

99
00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:56.583
I know. again.

100
00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:57.918
They gotta stop
doing this four days

101
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:59.653
before the month starts.

102
00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:02.389
I'll send you the
email. make the changes.

103
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.457
Thanks Rene.

104
00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.037
Mary. did you get the info
on the change for next month?

105
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.672
- No.
- If I send you some numbers.

106
00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:19.940
can you replace them for me?

107
00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:21.441
- Sure.
- All right. thanks.

108
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:24.878
Chandelle are those new
website photos ready?

109
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.449
- No. Ricky had those.
- Thank you.

110
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:35.589
Carol. have you seen Ricky?

111
00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:37.457
Okay. thank you.

112
00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.228
Hey. have you seen Ricky?

113
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.363
Not since this morning.

114
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.301
Hey man. have you seen Ricky?

115
00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:55.976
Ricky?

116
00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.911
Oh sorry Doug. just
looking for Ricky.

117
00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:01.248
Ricky. oh hey you look good man.

118
00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:03.450
No chance. bro.

119
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.484
No one can find him.

120
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.359
Ricky. do you have the
updated photos for the website?

121
00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.894
Which ones?

122
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.829
The updated product shots
for next month's promotion.

123
00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:17.597
- It changed?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:18.632
To what?

125
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.233
Now if you buy a
garden solar panel kit.

126
00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:21.435
you also get a garden toolkit.

127
00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:23.103
That's lame.

128
00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.604
It's actually a
really nice kit.

129
00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.039
Still lame.

130
00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:28.675
It comes with the nice leather
carrying bag and an apron.

131
00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:30.877
Chandelle should be on that.

132
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:32.779
Chandelle. are you kidding me?

133
00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:33.880
Are you sure?

134
00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:34.948
Oh. come on!

135
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.349
Dude. focus please Ricky.

136
00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:37.818
Are you sure?

137
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.886
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Chandelle
should be on that project.

138
00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:47.627
She's better.

139
00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.297
- Chandelle?
- Yep.

140
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.798
Ricky told me that
you were working

141
00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:53.400
in the new garden tool kit
photos for the website?

142
00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:55.802
- Yep.
- Okay. but you told me

143
00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:57.871
that Ricky. never mind.

144
00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:00.774
Can you email them to me please?

145
00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:02.075
- Yep.
- Thank you.

146
00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.584
Turns out we're going
to the original plan

147
00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.018
for promotion this month.

148
00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.955
- Great.
- No need to change.

149
00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:35.142
- Hey Tim.
- What's up?

150
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:42.216
You know. those
are for everyone.

151
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.951
I know. I'm just putting
a stash of them at my desk.

152
00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:48.622
But what if we run
out of them in here?

153
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.427
Look. the fruit
snacks always go first.

154
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:55.629
That's why I take a huge stash

155
00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:57.464
and I just put
them in my drawer.

156
00:09:57.497 --> 00:10:00.400
I mean. are we supposed to
go to your desk to grab them?

157
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.669
Either I can come up

158
00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:07.174
and grab one every day
like a homeless person

159
00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:10.410
or I can just come grab them
all at once every month.

160
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.946
It's actually more
time efficient bro.

161
00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.781
That's for you.

162
00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.016
I think we'd prefer for you

163
00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:17.551
to come in here
though once a day.

164
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.189
On the rare occasions
where inefficiency is best.

165
00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:23.190
he left a mess.

166
00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.846
Oh no. no. just start please.

167
00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:48.148
Just start. it's your only job.

168
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.818
Just start!

169
00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:10.170
No Connor.

170
00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:11.339
why would you show me that?

171
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:13.773
- That's disgusting.
- It's fricking awesome.

172
00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:14.708
Here. look at this one.

173
00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.344
No. no I'm good.

174
00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:17.577
And you're terrible.

175
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:18.745
You're a terrible.
horrible person.

176
00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.013
Wait. what's
going on down there.

177
00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.215
Connor's showing me
pictures of his poop.

178
00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:23.317
What. it's human art form.

179
00:11:23.351 --> 00:11:25.118
I mean. look at this log.

180
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:26.287
I did this this morning.

181
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.821
It came straight down.

182
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.324
landed perfectly vertical
in the toilet bowl.

183
00:11:30.358 --> 00:11:31.925
I'm surprised it
didn't fall over.

184
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.193
I mean. look at this?

185
00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:35.695
- No.
- Okay. okay. let me see it.

186
00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:36.863
Look at that.

187
00:11:36.897 --> 00:11:38.732
That is awesome.

188
00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:40.234
Okay all right. let me see.

189
00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.837
Oh. oh my gosh no.

190
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.071
Okay. take this.

191
00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:47.341
You know what. full disclosure

192
00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:48.775
and I'm no expert
on this Connor.

193
00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.379
but I'm fairly certain
COVID-19 originated with you.

194
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.613
It's just poop.
everybody poops.

195
00:11:53.647 --> 00:11:55.982
It's a book. a New
York Times bestseller.

196
00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:58.652
I mean. why do we have to
be so weird about poop?

197
00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.787
Hell. you know who poops?

198
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.588
The Pope.

199
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.891
The Pope poops.
Also true.

200
00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.159
Adam. Adam. save us please.

201
00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.661
All right. all right.
all right guys listen up.

202
00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.163
Poll question. so I'm
at the office. right?

203
00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.564
And I'm in the
community break room

204
00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:13.633
and this stupid little
hipster kid walks in

205
00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.502
and steals all the fruit snacks

206
00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:17.470
and stashes them at his desk.

207
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.273
He does that so that he
doesn't have to keep getting up

208
00:12:19.307 --> 00:12:20.540
to get more.

209
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.410
Now I say one fruit
snack for one trip.

210
00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:23.244
What say you?

211
00:12:23.277 --> 00:12:24.077
Wait. who was it?

212
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.545
Tim. the Copywriter.

213
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.846
Oh yeah. that
guy's a total douche.

214
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.448
- Douche.
- No. it's fine by me.

215
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.116
I mean. whatever makes
your life easier.

216
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.751
Connor. your whole
life is the easier.

217
00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:33.254
What about the rest
of the employees?

218
00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:34.621
Survival by the fittest?

219
00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:36.022
- Survival of the fittest?
- Yes. survival

220
00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:36.856
- of the fittest.
- Connor.

221
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.991
they're for everyone.

222
00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:39.192
It's not the fricking
hunger games.

223
00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:01.481
Ugh yeah. I can't even
rationalize that line of thinking.

224
00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.983
It bothers me so much

225
00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:04.617
that there's all these dumb
millennial kids just doing

226
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:06.086
whatever they want.

227
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.055
Whoa Adam. you know
you're millennial. right?

228
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:10.257
- Yeah.
- What?

229
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.792
No. I'm not.

230
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.928
- Yeah. you are.
- You guys?

231
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.263
What year were you born?

232
00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.064
- '86.
- Yup.

233
00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:22.203
- Ooh. millennial.
- Millennial.

234
00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:23.437
No. no. no. no. no.

235
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:25.272
Let's see that.
From 1982 to 2004.

236
00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:26.806
- Yep. that's you.
- What. no!

237
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.309
- Totally.
- You guys.

238
00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.076
I always thought millennial
were like way younger than me.

239
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.746
I'm not terribly old.
but I always put myself

240
00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:33.747
in the Gen X tribe.

241
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.615
No way. Gen X is the lame.

242
00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.485
But that's how I
lived my whole life.

243
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:38.785
I always worked really hard

244
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.587
and always tried to
do the right thing.

245
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.122
I hate millennial mentality.

246
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.992
Could you try the organic
lotion on my feet?

247
00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:48.528
I just love the way
it makes my toes feel.

248
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:49.596
Do you hear that?

249
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:50.797
Yeah. he's always millennial.

250
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.299
Hey. make sure you get
your cuticles this time.

251
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:53.367
We saw your feet last week.

252
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:55.436
- oh my gosh.
- Okay. stop.

253
00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:27.468
Hey. I wanna buy this drink
and you're gonna sell it to me.

254
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:28.668
So get off your damn phone

255
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.570
and scan it and then
put it in a bag.

256
00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:43.417
Now ask me if I want the
receipt in the bag. ask me.

257
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:45.618
Would you like your
receipt in your bag?

258
00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:46.920
No. no I wouldn't.

259
00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:58.765
Actually. I don't know what
kind of credit card information

260
00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:00.334
is left on there.

261
00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:01.668
Oh. just the last four digits.

262
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:03.169
but still I don't wanna give you

263
00:15:03.204 --> 00:15:05.939
or anyone else the satisfaction
knowing the last four digits

264
00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:07.475
of my credit card dipshit.

265
00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:13.581
Thanks for shopping at
Big Jim's corner store.

266
00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.084
- Hey babe
- Hey.

267
00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:21.688
What's wrong?

268
00:15:21.721 --> 00:15:23.457
I'm a fricking
millennial that's what.

269
00:15:23.491 --> 00:15:25.559
- What?
- A millennial.

270
00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:29.028
A selfish. lazy penis
ball cancer on society.

271
00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:30.598
I'm sorry to hear that.

272
00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:33.032
Okay. you don't care.

273
00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.602
Go ahead and make fun of me.

274
00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:35.603
No. no. no. no.

275
00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:36.736
I'm not making fun of you.

276
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.606
And newsflash.
you're one of them too.

277
00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:41.609
So what's the big deal
with being a millennial?

278
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:42.876
I hate them.

279
00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:44.677
I don't even want to
identify with them.

280
00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:47.013
The millennial mentality
is the complete opposite

281
00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.549
of all of my core beliefs.

282
00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:50.884
I know. one might say that
they are the inferior race.

283
00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:52.419
- Exactly.
- I know.

284
00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:57.023
Okay. you're definitely
making fun of me.

285
00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.993
Okay yeah. that time I was.
but I wasn't the first time.

286
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:03.129
I can't even get the
support of my own wife.

287
00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:06.233
Okay. I don't get it. just
because you are a millennial.

288
00:16:06.267 --> 00:16:08.369
it doesn't mean you
have to be one of them.

289
00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.603
Well. that's just it.

290
00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:11.137
I realized I hate
millennials so much

291
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:12.872
because I'm jealous of them.

292
00:16:12.906 --> 00:16:14.642
Everything they do
is the exact opposite

293
00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:16.210
of how I live my life.

294
00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:18.778
I'm uptight. stressed
out. a little dramatic.

295
00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.013
A little?

296
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.915
The point is I do
everything by the book

297
00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.251
and I look at these piss
hand kids and I'm envious

298
00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:25.685
of how nonchalant they are.

299
00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.053
how they can do whatever
the hell they want

300
00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.489
without any consequences.

301
00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:30.723
Okay. well I'm sure there
are some consequences.

302
00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:31.824
I can't stop
thinking about this.

303
00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:33.026
Thinking about what?

304
00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:35.061
About embracing millennialism.

305
00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:37.531
Okay. well I think you
should just go to bed

306
00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:39.333
and you'll stop
thinking about it.

307
00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.733
I'm pretty sure this is
just like another one

308
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.436
of your things.

309
00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:44.505
I'm gonna start
living among my people.

310
00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:49.510
I'm going to become
a millennial.

311
00:16:49.543 --> 00:16:51.512
Meaning what exactly?

312
00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:53.746
I'm gonna start
being more selfish.

313
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.482
If I want a piece of
cake for breakfast.

314
00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:58.352
I'm gonna eat a flipping
piece of cake for breakfast.

315
00:16:58.385 --> 00:17:00.820
No more being Mr. Responsible.

316
00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.523
So you're just going to
start doing whatever you want?

317
00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:03.923
- Whatever.
- Absolutely whatever?

318
00:17:03.957 --> 00:17:08.094
Completely whatever.
100% whatever I want.

319
00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.397
So is this like the
one time you went vegan?

320
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.834
Do you guys have anything
vegan that comes on a bone?

321
00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:19.440
All right.
does this little game

322
00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:21.575
include other women?

323
00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.843
Oh no.
this is no game.

324
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.044
All right. I know.

325
00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:26.547
but you're just
like way too sweet.

326
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.748
You can't even come up with
your top five celebrity list.

327
00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.517
Okay well. that is
way too much pressure.

328
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:31.751
Only five women?

329
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.220
My goodness. too
many parameters go

330
00:17:33.254 --> 00:17:34.655
into that decision for me.

331
00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:35.989
I mean. who is on your top five?

332
00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:38.191
Will Smith. Channing
Tatum. Zac Efron.

333
00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:41.328
Dwayne the Rock
Johnson and Gal Gadot.

334
00:17:41.362 --> 00:17:43.129
Okay well. that was a little
bit delivered too quickly

335
00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:44.465
for my liking.

336
00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:46.533
I know. but if you come
to bed. I will show you

337
00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.569
who my main man is.

338
00:17:48.602 --> 00:17:50.671
I can't. I feel like my
heart's beating out of my chest.

339
00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:53.072
Is the millennial you
just like that excited?

340
00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:54.742
Nope. I had my
first energy drink.

341
00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.175
I think it's working
a little bit too good.

342
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.211
A little too well.

343
00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:02.915
- Hey man.
- Hey. what's up?

344
00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:03.783
Oh. nothing.

345
00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:06.420
Are you going to work?

346
00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:08.455
Yeah. I just wanted
to talk about something

347
00:18:08.489 --> 00:18:10.291
- with you real quick.
- Okay.

348
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:14.827
I just figured you'd be
someone who would understand

349
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:16.095
what I'm going through.

350
00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.431
- Eggs?
- No. I'm good.

351
00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:19.899
So with your inside information.

352
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.636
what is the next big social
movement going to be?

353
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.605
My inside information?

354
00:18:24.638 --> 00:18:26.674
Yeah. so I was late
to the whole acceptance

355
00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:28.041
of the gay phase.

356
00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:29.108
Not a phase.

357
00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:30.711
What I mean is I was
the borderline bigot

358
00:18:30.744 --> 00:18:32.111
to the gay community
even though now I've come

359
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:33.046
to accept their decision.

360
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.281
Not a decision.

361
00:18:34.315 --> 00:18:35.649
Okay. I need you to
stop taking offense

362
00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:36.517
to everything I'm saying.

363
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.451
Stop being offensive.

364
00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:38.719
Okay. just listen all right?

365
00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:40.186
This isn't about your stuff.

366
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.423
This is about my stuff so
just shut up and deal with it.

367
00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.890
I'm not trying to offend you.

368
00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:45.392
Well. you are so.

369
00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:46.226
Oh well. I'm sorry.

370
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.461
It's so hard

371
00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:49.195
for me considering I think
all gays are going to hell.

372
00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:50.264
Nice. and more simply

373
00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:51.732
because you think
penises are gross.

374
00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:53.199
Well. I'm even
repulsed by my own.

375
00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:54.435
Love is love. man.

376
00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:56.236
Okay. and that's
exactly why I'm here.

377
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.104
Look. I don't care
about the gays.

378
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.407
Screw them. I missed
that social fight.

379
00:19:00.441 --> 00:19:04.177
Ah. straight White
male life. so simple.

380
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:06.313
Okay. I can fight for my
straight White male rights

381
00:19:06.347 --> 00:19:07.781
if I had to.

382
00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:08.716
Could you though?

383
00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:09.916
Thank you all for coming.

384
00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:12.219
- Yeah. USA. USA
- USA. USA.

385
00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:14.288
Go away. go away.

386
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.123
This was a mistake.

387
00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:21.261
Guys put the signs
down. put the sign down.

388
00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.331
Okay. shut up.

389
00:19:24.365 --> 00:19:26.533
Look. what is the next big
social movement going to be?

390
00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:29.303
What do you mean you don't know?

391
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.671
Teddy. come on.

392
00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:32.406
I need to be on the front
lines of accepting it.

393
00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:35.074
Adam. it's not like the gays

394
00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:36.876
or the minorities get together

395
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.481
and have secret meetings
about how to overtake society.

396
00:19:40.514 --> 00:19:43.182
Bestiality it's
bestiality isn't it?

397
00:19:43.217 --> 00:19:44.752
I'll do love is love.

398
00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:46.320
Oh come on. man.

399
00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:47.321
I'm on your team.

400
00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.822
I don't want you on my team.

401
00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.657
but also I don't know what the
next big social movement is.

402
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:53.893
I think everyone should
love who they wanna love

403
00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:56.195
and be comfortable and accepted

404
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.531
for who they are. that's it.

405
00:19:57.564 --> 00:19:58.632
That is so generic.

406
00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:00.199
I got a question geez.

407
00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:02.703
Sorry to interrupt your love.

408
00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:07.374
If God doesn't accept
homosexuality. right?

409
00:20:07.408 --> 00:20:11.110
Sorry Teddy. and he does not
accept bestiality. right?

410
00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:14.080
Is it more worse
or more punishable

411
00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:17.718
if like a human dude got
it on with an animal dude?

412
00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:19.720
Or is it like two
different things.

413
00:20:19.753 --> 00:20:22.423
or is it because there's two
negatives it makes a positive?

414
00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:23.457
Does it even matter?

415
00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.593
Connor. you are
completely naked

416
00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:28.662
in front of your gay roommate.

417
00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:30.531
Relax. I mean it's not

418
00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:32.633
like Teddys' gonna
rape me or anything.

419
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:35.602
Still Jezebel. you're just
throwing temptation out there.

420
00:20:35.636 --> 00:20:36.670
Oh. hold on.

421
00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:38.639
That is closer to bestiality.

422
00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:43.644
- Wow. hey!
- Oh. come back here Rona.

423
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:46.078
Oh come on. don't be so sad.

424
00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:47.414
We're just playing.

425
00:20:47.448 --> 00:20:49.182
I love you Connor.

426
00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:50.751
Anyway. what is this.
what's happening?

427
00:20:50.784 --> 00:20:53.487
Oh. well I have
decided to come out

428
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.322
of my proverbial
closet if you will

429
00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:58.459
and embrace my
millennialistic ways.

430
00:20:58.492 --> 00:20:59.992
What does that even mean?

431
00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:01.595
I'm glad you asked.

432
00:21:01.628 --> 00:21:03.664
Ah. I wondered
what that was for.

433
00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:07.301
Okay. let's see here.

434
00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.137
Millennial. a person
reaching young adulthood

435
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.775
in the early 21st century who
grew up on computer technology

436
00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:18.712
and is often referred to as
the me. me. me generation.

437
00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:19.947
Okay?

438
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:23.851
So I am going to
become a millennial.

439
00:21:23.884 --> 00:21:26.653
Okay. just so I
have this straight.

440
00:21:26.687 --> 00:21:28.689
You coming out as a millennial

441
00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:31.325
is the same as me
coming out as gay.

442
00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:33.327
See. I knew you'd get it.

443
00:21:34.495 --> 00:21:37.564
- You're so brave.
- Thank you.

444
00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:39.098
Wait a minute. wait a minute.

445
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.668
Millennial wouldn't even
be in this dictionary.

446
00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:48.976
Oh okay. I think you
might be more millennial

447
00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:51.712
than you give
yourself credit for.

448
00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:53.012
What?

449
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.882
I wanted it to have a
more dramatic effect.

450
00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:56.283
No. this is nice.

451
00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.317
I like this.

452
00:21:57.351 --> 00:21:58.585
Good job. I approve.

453
00:21:58.619 --> 00:21:59.553
Thank you.

454
00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:00.954
How long did that take you?

455
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:01.755
Way too long.

456
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:16.703
- Hello there. Father.
- Hello brother.

457
00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:18.472
What can I help you with?

458
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:21.742
Oh father. I am
here to prepent.

459
00:22:21.775 --> 00:22:22.743
You're here to what?

460
00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:23.977
- Prepent
- Prepent?

461
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:25.979
Prepent. I would
like to confess

462
00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.381
of sins I'm going to commit.

463
00:22:27.414 --> 00:22:28.849
It's not exactly how it works.

464
00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:31.018
Well. I figured I can come
in here and take care of all

465
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.619
of the guilt and the feeling bad

466
00:22:32.653 --> 00:22:34.521
and the confession stuff
now so I can go out

467
00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:36.690
and enjoy the sin with
a clear conscience.

468
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.860
We are here to avoid sin.

469
00:22:39.893 --> 00:22:41.895
- Right.
- And to try our best

470
00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:43.797
- to be like Jesus.
- Right. I get that.

471
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.265
But you're wanting to go sin?

472
00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:46.800
- Correct.
- And confess those sins

473
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:48.302
before we actually
commit those sins.

474
00:22:48.335 --> 00:22:49.469
Correct. you get it.

475
00:22:49.503 --> 00:22:51.103
This isn't in God's teachings.

476
00:22:51.137 --> 00:22:53.473
- Agreed.
- So why would you want

477
00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:54.741
to go sin?

478
00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:56.175
Well. I figured we're
all imperfect. right?

479
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:57.744
- Right.
- And we all sin. correct?

480
00:22:57.778 --> 00:22:59.078
- Correct.
- So why not confess

481
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:01.147
of the sin now so we
can enjoy them later?

482
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.250
Because then those
things would be even worse.

483
00:23:03.283 --> 00:23:04.484
Why?

484
00:23:04.518 --> 00:23:05.919
Because they'd be
premeditated sins.

485
00:23:05.953 --> 00:23:07.521
Well. that's why I
wanna confess of them now.

486
00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:09.256
Prepentance isn't a thing.

487
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:10.424
I beg to differ.

488
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:11.858
I'm literally
doing it right now.

489
00:23:11.892 --> 00:23:14.328
Sort of a confession
before the crime.

490
00:23:14.361 --> 00:23:15.562
What's the difference?

491
00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:17.331
What kinds of sins are
we talking about here?

492
00:23:17.364 --> 00:23:18.966
Oh. I don't know exactly.

493
00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:20.434
Then how are we
supposed to prepent

494
00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:21.935
if you don't know
what your sins are?

495
00:23:21.969 --> 00:23:23.403
So prepentance is a thing?

496
00:23:23.437 --> 00:23:25.005
I'm just trying to understand.

497
00:23:25.038 --> 00:23:26.340
What propellant is.

498
00:23:26.373 --> 00:23:28.275
No. I fully get the concept.

499
00:23:28.308 --> 00:23:30.877
I want to understand what
sins you're wanting to do.

500
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.111
Well. here's the thing.

501
00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.680
I have been a pretty
straight shooter.

502
00:23:33.714 --> 00:23:36.249
I'm talking grade
A heavy material.

503
00:23:36.283 --> 00:23:37.484
That's a good thing.

504
00:23:37.517 --> 00:23:39.886
But I'm going through
this like life crisis.

505
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.855
And I just wanna let
loose. Carpe diem.

506
00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:45.392
sow my wild oats. rub my
nose into some fruit salad

507
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:46.226
if you will.

508
00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:47.461
But you don't know

509
00:23:47.494 --> 00:23:49.096
what commandments you
would want to break?

510
00:23:50.564 --> 00:23:51.832
No. no. no. not really.

511
00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:53.433
I mean. I'm open to
some suggestions.

512
00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:54.935
I just know I wanna
become a millennial

513
00:23:54.968 --> 00:23:56.503
and basically be more selfish

514
00:23:56.536 --> 00:23:59.673
and do whatever the hell I
want. oh excuse me father.

515
00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:02.075
My worry is that you
will stumble into sin

516
00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:04.678
and then not be able to get
yourself back out of it.

517
00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:08.315
Right. right. that's
definitely a possibility.

518
00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:09.449
What about your family?

519
00:24:09.483 --> 00:24:10.651
Oh. they're on board.

520
00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.388
I guess that settles it.

521
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:15.722
So I have your blessing then?

522
00:24:15.756 --> 00:24:17.124
- No.
- You vocally said no there

523
00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:20.093
but I feel like
your heart said yes.

524
00:24:20.127 --> 00:24:21.795
- No
- I love you Father.

525
00:24:32.973 --> 00:24:34.041
What's going on here?

526
00:24:35.242 --> 00:24:37.611
They're seeing who can
hold their pee the most.

527
00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:39.780
Okay you guys. I came
here to reveal my big plan

528
00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:42.449
and how I'm gonna start living
my life as a millennial.

529
00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:44.351
My third life
crisis if you will.

530
00:24:44.384 --> 00:24:47.054
That makes it sound like
it's your third life crisis.

531
00:24:47.087 --> 00:24:49.856
I think you've had one.
two. three life crisises.

532
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.558
Good point. not like
it's a third point

533
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:53.360
in your life crisis?

534
00:24:53.393 --> 00:24:54.861
Mid-life crisis works.

535
00:24:54.895 --> 00:24:56.897
If we used half-life crisis.
it would just cause confusion.

536
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.066
Okay. but like a third of my
life. what would I call that?

537
00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:00.567
I think that's why
a third life crisis

538
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.601
isn't a thing bud.

539
00:25:02.536 --> 00:25:04.237
Why are you doing so
much better than he is?

540
00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:06.673
Oh. I didn't even come close
to drinking my gallon of water.

541
00:25:06.707 --> 00:25:10.944
You beautiful bastard.
you son of a. move. move.

542
00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:14.581
First order of business.
get some new friends.

543
00:25:14.614 --> 00:25:15.849
Whatever.

544
00:25:15.882 --> 00:25:17.184
I don't mean I'm
gonna replace you.

545
00:25:17.217 --> 00:25:18.418
I just need additional friends.

546
00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:20.854
I just need a splash
of class in my life.

547
00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:23.857
Where do I find sophisticated
people like the ones

548
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.228
that go to museums or
talk politics or whatnot?

549
00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:29.996
How about at a museum?

550
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.999
Okay. but I don't want
to actually go to a museum.

551
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:34.234
Okay. so what is that?

552
00:25:36.002 --> 00:25:37.003
I didn't make it.

553
00:25:39.706 --> 00:25:41.875
Connor. go take a shower.

554
00:25:41.908 --> 00:25:43.310
Why do I even have to tell you?

555
00:25:43.343 --> 00:25:44.611
That should be your next step.

556
00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:47.514
- Sorry. jeez.
- Awesome.

557
00:25:47.547 --> 00:25:49.217
It's not like I drank
a gallon of water.

558
00:25:49.249 --> 00:25:50.717
All right you guys. come on.

559
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:54.588
It's time for me to reveal
my plan "Home Alone" style.

560
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:56.089
I don't understand
that reference.

561
00:25:56.123 --> 00:25:57.691
You know. when little
Kevin makes the blueprints

562
00:25:57.724 --> 00:25:58.959
for when the robbers are coming?

563
00:25:58.992 --> 00:26:00.327
That's a pretty
obscure reference..

564
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.561
Dude come on. just go with it.

565
00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:02.763
You're ruining my
big reveal here.

566
00:26:02.796 --> 00:26:05.098
I mean. if you
were just gone aah!

567
00:26:05.132 --> 00:26:06.800
Then I'd be right
there with you.

568
00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:08.001
That has nothing
to do with this.

569
00:26:08.034 --> 00:26:09.237
Well then. use a
reference that works.

570
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:10.971
I'm sorry. it's just
the best Christmas movie

571
00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:12.572
of all time I would
have expected you

572
00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:14.040
- to get it.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

573
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:16.309
"Home Alone" is not even
the best "Home Alone" movie

574
00:26:16.343 --> 00:26:18.712
of all time. let alone
the best Christmas movie.

575
00:26:18.745 --> 00:26:20.947
Are you suggesting that
when little Kevin is lost

576
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:22.983
in New York City that
that's a superior film?

577
00:26:23.016 --> 00:26:25.285
- Yeah.
- Cheap for a sequel rip off

578
00:26:25.318 --> 00:26:28.321
as if Mr. And Mrs. McCallister
would lose their son again.

579
00:26:28.355 --> 00:26:30.891
Not to mention the title has
nothing to do with the plot.

580
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.392
He's not even home alone again.

581
00:26:32.425 --> 00:26:34.228
Whatever. it's still not
the best Christmas movie

582
00:26:34.262 --> 00:26:35.061
of all time.

583
00:26:35.095 --> 00:26:36.396
Oh yeah. what is?

584
00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:37.664
"Love Actually".

585
00:26:37.697 --> 00:26:40.467
Yeah. I mean maybe.

586
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.002
I'm sure all
your gay friends say that.

587
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:43.770
Lift yourself higher Adam.

588
00:26:43.804 --> 00:26:48.276
Okay. so basically
I made a detailed list

589
00:26:48.308 --> 00:26:51.645
of all the things that I could
find that millennials do.

590
00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:55.015
A simple Excel spreadsheet
would have sufficed.

591
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:57.684
Yeah. but not nearly
as cool or dramatic.

592
00:26:57.717 --> 00:26:59.986
I expected you to be the
one to understand this.

593
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.023
Oh my God. another
gay stereotype.

594
00:27:03.056 --> 00:27:05.192
That is so sweet.

595
00:27:05.226 --> 00:27:06.693
Dude. you should dust off some

596
00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:09.396
of your famous high school
journalism with this.

597
00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:11.331
Are you concerned with
a modern day cast being

598
00:27:11.364 --> 00:27:13.301
in a Shakespeare period piece?.

599
00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:14.167
Nope.

600
00:27:16.837 --> 00:27:19.273
Drama in the drama club.

601
00:27:19.307 --> 00:27:22.310
Rumor has it that chip prices
will increase next week.

602
00:27:22.342 --> 00:27:24.278
Can you confirm?

603
00:27:24.312 --> 00:27:25.545
I don't know.

604
00:27:25.579 --> 00:27:28.949
Inflation attacks
high school ta ta tan!

605
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:34.588
Whatever the high school
equivalent of a Pulitzer prize is.

606
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:36.122
I would have it.

607
00:27:36.156 --> 00:27:38.091
Whatever Adam. this is just
another one of your charades.

608
00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:39.426
You'll be done with
this soon enough.

609
00:27:39.459 --> 00:27:40.994
Not this time my gay friend.

610
00:27:42.462 --> 00:27:43.297
Props to you.

611
00:27:44.764 --> 00:27:46.399
The next time you both see me.

612
00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:49.002
I will be a full
blown millennial.

613
00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:54.608
Bye!

614
00:27:54.641 --> 00:27:57.777
Anyways. I think if the
entire world converted to bamboo

615
00:27:57.811 --> 00:27:59.713
instead of use plastic.

616
00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:01.915
you could end all the
atrocities of war.

617
00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:13.294
Oh. look at this grandpa.

618
00:28:18.832 --> 00:28:20.467
Yeah. nice head dick wad.

619
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:55.568
One. two. three.

620
00:28:57.305 --> 00:28:58.471
- Roar!
- Roar!

621
00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:00.874
What is this?

622
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:16.589
You got the claws.

623
00:29:19.492 --> 00:29:20.760
- Oh no!
- Truman!

624
00:29:20.794 --> 00:29:22.729
The master's waking up!

625
00:29:24.798 --> 00:29:25.865
Set and fire!

626
00:29:28.468 --> 00:29:30.404
- Are you sick?
- Nope.

627
00:29:30.438 --> 00:29:32.505
Aren't you gonna
be late for work?

628
00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:33.473
What work?

629
00:29:34.308 --> 00:29:35.409
Hardy. ha ha.

630
00:29:35.443 --> 00:29:37.143
No seriously. I quit.

631
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.380
You're joking?

632
00:29:39.413 --> 00:29:40.580
No seriously. I quit.

633
00:29:42.048 --> 00:29:43.984
Hey kids. why don't you go
downstairs and watch a show?

634
00:29:44.017 --> 00:29:46.052
- No. we wanna play.
- No. we wanna play.

635
00:29:46.086 --> 00:29:47.787
Oh. if you go downstairs
and watch your show.

636
00:29:47.821 --> 00:29:49.089
I'll make you pancakes.

637
00:29:49.122 --> 00:29:50.324
- Pancakes!
- Pancakes!

638
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.594
You quit?

639
00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:56.963
I'm pretty sure.

640
00:29:58.698 --> 00:30:00.267
Well. did you or didn't you?

641
00:30:28.895 --> 00:30:30.196
It's not funny.

642
00:30:30.231 --> 00:30:32.532
Well. it's not. not funny.

643
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.902
Why did you do that?

644
00:30:35.935 --> 00:30:37.371
Well. it was a diss kind of cake

645
00:30:37.405 --> 00:30:39.172
and they said they would put
whatever I wanted on the cake.

646
00:30:39.206 --> 00:30:41.141
Okay no. why did you quit?

647
00:30:41.174 --> 00:30:44.478
Well. I was doing a job
that I hated for so long.

648
00:30:44.512 --> 00:30:47.248
It was time for me to be happy.

649
00:30:49.383 --> 00:30:50.850
I don't think
that was really fair

650
00:30:50.884 --> 00:30:53.220
that you didn't even talk
to me about it first.

651
00:30:53.254 --> 00:30:54.854
Well trust me. this
is just one little step

652
00:30:54.888 --> 00:30:55.855
of my millennial journey.

653
00:30:55.889 --> 00:30:57.224
Okay well. I hope
that works out.

654
00:30:57.258 --> 00:31:00.528
Hey. I got you.

655
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.062
Yeah well. curiosity
killed the cat you know?

656
00:31:02.095 --> 00:31:03.596
So I have nine
lives to do my thing.

657
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.831
That is not what that means.

658
00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:06.099
It means that the
cat was so curious.

659
00:31:06.132 --> 00:31:06.966
it ended up killing itself.

660
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.235
Why not curiosity
killed the dog.

661
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:09.803
I mean. I guess cats are
more curious than dogs.

662
00:31:09.836 --> 00:31:11.571
I don't know. I find
dogs quite curious.

663
00:31:11.604 --> 00:31:13.106
Okay. that's
not what it means.

664
00:31:13.139 --> 00:31:14.275
And I didn't come up with
the saying so you can stop

665
00:31:14.308 --> 00:31:15.809
- being an ass hat.
- Stupid saying really.

666
00:31:15.842 --> 00:31:17.010
What are we gonna do

667
00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:18.178
for money now that
you don't have a job?

668
00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:19.413
Oh okay. I see how it is.

669
00:31:19.447 --> 00:31:20.713
You're just using
me for my paycheck?

670
00:31:20.747 --> 00:31:22.516
Yeah. 'cause this
girl has got to eat.

671
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.017
Okay. we're gonna be fine.

672
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.653
I have enough PTO cash that
will last a while. all right?

673
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.500
- Hey there!
- Hello. are you Sydney?

674
00:31:39.533 --> 00:31:41.935
That's me.

675
00:31:41.968 --> 00:31:44.205
I'm Adam. I'm
here to interview

676
00:31:44.238 --> 00:31:46.039
for the barrister position.

677
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:47.241
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

678
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:52.078
- Corporate guy aren't you?
- Was.

679
00:31:52.112 --> 00:31:52.912
Why'd you quit?

680
00:31:55.648 --> 00:31:57.150
No more Mr. Ratchett.

681
00:31:57.183 --> 00:32:00.720
Keep playing.

682
00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:04.592
I'm just looking for
something new and exciting.

683
00:32:08.462 --> 00:32:11.332
- Huh?
- Huh. what?

684
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.634
Don't know if
you'd be a fit here.

685
00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:15.902
Why is that?

686
00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:18.805
Am I not young or cool
or hip enough for you?

687
00:32:18.838 --> 00:32:22.041
I mean. I think it's unfair
to judge me so quickly.

688
00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:24.211
Just don't know if
you can hack this job.

689
00:32:24.245 --> 00:32:25.812
I've worked a much
more difficult job

690
00:32:25.845 --> 00:32:27.214
for the past 10 years.

691
00:32:27.248 --> 00:32:30.217
I think I can handle
pouring coffee.

692
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:33.119
This job is crazy
and fast paced

693
00:32:33.153 --> 00:32:36.189
and it doesn't pay that well so.

694
00:32:36.223 --> 00:32:38.359
I'm game. I want this job.

695
00:32:43.663 --> 00:32:46.600
Excuse me. eyes up here please.

696
00:32:49.236 --> 00:32:53.641
Okay. okay. we'll
give you a shot.

697
00:32:53.673 --> 00:32:56.142
Great. when do I start?

698
00:32:57.744 --> 00:32:58.546
Right now.

699
00:33:03.617 --> 00:33:05.718
- No. stop. no!
- What. do I push this button?

700
00:33:05.752 --> 00:33:07.787
No. I told you it
was the other one.

701
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.055
I'm sorry. it's my first time.

702
00:33:09.088 --> 00:33:10.957
No. stop spraying everywhere.

703
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.826
- Whoa!
- Adam. I was talking

704
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.429
about the espresso.

705
00:33:15.462 --> 00:33:16.763
Oh. sure you were.

706
00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:19.633
Jeff. here you go.

707
00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:21.535
Have a good day Jeff.

708
00:33:21.569 --> 00:33:23.337
Did you just see my
customer service?

709
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.071
I did and it was impressive.

710
00:33:25.104 --> 00:33:26.806
You hired the right guy.

711
00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:27.675
I guess I did.

712
00:33:30.544 --> 00:33:31.378
Who's this?

713
00:33:31.412 --> 00:33:33.947
Oh Todd. this is Adam.

714
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.181
He just started today.

715
00:33:35.216 --> 00:33:39.953
- Hey man.
- You needed another person?

716
00:33:41.589 --> 00:33:44.625
- Yeah.
- I see.

717
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.598
- He's a bit dramatic.
- I'll say.

718
00:34:18.791 --> 00:34:20.026
What is this?

719
00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:22.161
The kids are at my mom's

720
00:34:22.195 --> 00:34:25.031
and we are gonna have
a millennial day out.

721
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.234
Oh?

722
00:34:28.435 --> 00:34:30.003
I'm trying to do this with you.

723
00:34:31.472 --> 00:34:32.573
I don't deserve you.

724
00:34:40.681 --> 00:34:42.549
Oh wait. are you kidding me?

725
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:44.117
- This place?
- Oh come on.

726
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.220
this is like the most
millennial place in town.

727
00:34:46.253 --> 00:34:49.188
It's hip. modern and
everything is vegan.

728
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:52.158
Yeah. I don't wanna do this.

729
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:54.528
Oh come on. millennial
up Adam. let's go.

730
00:34:55.696 --> 00:34:58.031
Oh. Lord help me.

731
00:34:58.064 --> 00:35:00.734
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

732
00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:10.977
Hello?

733
00:35:13.414 --> 00:35:15.316
Oh. what do you want?

734
00:35:17.584 --> 00:35:21.020
Can I get a
raspberry iced tea?

735
00:35:21.054 --> 00:35:23.390
I'll just have a decaf coffee.

736
00:35:23.424 --> 00:35:26.025
Oh. 'cause you don't
already have everything. mmh?

737
00:35:29.229 --> 00:35:30.397
$8.36.

738
00:35:37.638 --> 00:35:40.240
Oh. and can I get my receipt?

739
00:35:48.682 --> 00:35:51.719
Wow. service here
is really great. huh?

740
00:35:52.753 --> 00:35:53.986
Hmm mmh.

741
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.122
It's a pretty cool
place though. yeah?

742
00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:57.990
Yeah.

743
00:36:00.026 --> 00:36:02.529
- Are you okay?
- Hmm. what. yeah.

744
00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:10.970
Oops.

745
00:36:12.272 --> 00:36:14.040
Do you have a problem with us?

746
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:17.411
Excuse me. I'd like to
speak to your manager!

747
00:36:17.444 --> 00:36:18.445
What are you doing?

748
00:36:18.479 --> 00:36:19.747
I don't think he should
treat us like that.

749
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.980
It's fine. it's fine.

750
00:36:22.148 --> 00:36:23.817
Is everything
alright over here?

751
00:36:24.951 --> 00:36:27.488
Oh okay. is he bothering you

752
00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:28.622
'cause I can kick him out?

753
00:36:29.922 --> 00:36:32.526
No. actually your
employee over there

754
00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:34.294
has been extremely rude to us.

755
00:36:34.328 --> 00:36:37.431
Oh gosh. sometimes it feels
like I'm running a daycare.

756
00:36:37.464 --> 00:36:39.867
I apologize for
Todd there. he's.

757
00:36:39.899 --> 00:36:41.535
Anyways. I'm Sydney.

758
00:36:41.568 --> 00:36:45.372
Oh. Jennifer and this is Adam.

759
00:36:46.407 --> 00:36:47.641
But of course.

760
00:36:49.643 --> 00:36:51.311
Are you gonna shake her hand?

761
00:36:53.112 --> 00:36:57.183
Oh no. no. I think that
would actually be rude

762
00:36:57.217 --> 00:37:00.554
to shake her hand. or your
hand or like anyone else's hand

763
00:37:00.587 --> 00:37:04.591
'cause I'm actually still
practicing social distancing so.

764
00:37:04.625 --> 00:37:05.826
I love this guy.

765
00:37:05.859 --> 00:37:07.895
Anyway. you two enjoy.

766
00:37:07.927 --> 00:37:09.863
Oh. I forgot something.

767
00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:11.565
Why are you being so weird?

768
00:37:11.598 --> 00:37:14.167
It's this place.
it's not my vibe.

769
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:18.639
You forgot this.

770
00:37:18.672 --> 00:37:22.342
Oh. look at that. a
souvenir.

771
00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:32.419
Well. thank you so
much for the coffee

772
00:37:32.453 --> 00:37:37.357
and the tea and the
souvenir and the hand shakes

773
00:37:37.391 --> 00:37:40.594
and it's just great. great.

774
00:37:40.627 --> 00:37:44.030
We should probably
be going you know?

775
00:37:44.063 --> 00:37:45.699
No. we just got here.

776
00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:47.033
Come on. let's just.

777
00:37:47.066 --> 00:37:49.436
Thank you. thank you.

778
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.940
All right. I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

779
00:37:54.341 --> 00:37:57.211
Don't be so pretentious
as if I'm coming back.

780
00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:38.585
- Hello.
- Hi.

781
00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.288
Hello. how are you doing?

782
00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:43.189
Good.

783
00:38:50.764 --> 00:38:51.865
So what happens next?

784
00:38:53.934 --> 00:38:58.939
Right. ask if you can help
the customer with anything.

785
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:07.981
Well. I was
looking at this car.

786
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.652
Can you tell me
anything about it?

787
00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:25.131
This is a blue car.

788
00:39:28.936 --> 00:39:32.039
Oh. interesting. interesting.

789
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.274
So it runs well?

790
00:39:39.346 --> 00:39:41.415
It's a good model of car?

791
00:39:42.716 --> 00:39:43.684
Hmm hmm.

792
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.955
All right. I'm gonna be
straight with you. Paul.

793
00:39:47.988 --> 00:39:49.155
I don't know enough about cars

794
00:39:49.188 --> 00:39:50.390
or know what to
even ask about them.

795
00:39:50.424 --> 00:39:53.260
So I'm just gonna
say if it runs well

796
00:39:53.293 --> 00:39:57.464
and it looks pretty.
that's good enough for me.

797
00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.299
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

798
00:40:03.337 --> 00:40:07.307
So I think I'll take it.

799
00:40:07.341 --> 00:40:09.076
Okay. you have
a good day. sir.

800
00:40:11.478 --> 00:40:14.414
Paul. Paul. get
back here. buddy.

801
00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:21.321
I'm gonna need you to
listen to my words.

802
00:40:21.355 --> 00:40:23.557
I want to buy this car.

803
00:40:30.129 --> 00:40:32.899
That's great. my first sale.

804
00:40:32.933 --> 00:40:35.302
Oh well. that's surprising.

805
00:40:36.637 --> 00:40:38.839
I'm glad this
could be our first.

806
00:40:38.872 --> 00:40:40.207
It's more special that way.

807
00:40:41.675 --> 00:40:43.944
All right. I'm gonna make this
a real quick and easy for you.

808
00:40:43.977 --> 00:40:46.246
I just have one simple request.

809
00:40:46.279 --> 00:40:48.849
You know those big bows
that you put on cars?

810
00:40:50.017 --> 00:40:51.852
Is there any way I
can get one of those?

811
00:41:00.894 --> 00:41:02.229
Just right on the top there.

812
00:41:03.664 --> 00:41:04.498
Maybe the front.

813
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.802
We don't have those here.

814
00:41:10.737 --> 00:41:13.607
I think they only do
those on TV commercials

815
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.645
or on luxury cars. not
on cars less than 10.000.

816
00:41:19.513 --> 00:41:23.216
Right. right. well Paul.

817
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.522
I don't know what
to tell you. man.

818
00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:30.657
I mean the car is great and all.

819
00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:34.227
but I really just want
one of those bows.

820
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:40.600
There's gotta be something
that you can do for me.

821
00:41:46.807 --> 00:41:47.607
Come on Paul.

822
00:41:51.211 --> 00:41:55.215
Look out folks. just a sexy
guy driving on through.

823
00:42:08.729 --> 00:42:09.930
I like your
sunglasses daddy.

824
00:42:09.963 --> 00:42:11.331
Oh. thank you darling.

825
00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:13.233
Mom. can I wear my sunglasses?

826
00:42:13.266 --> 00:42:14.367
No sweetheart.

827
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:15.902
But daddy is.

828
00:42:15.936 --> 00:42:18.371
That's because daddy's
having a nervous breakdown.

829
00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:19.773
Oh. ha ha.

830
00:42:19.806 --> 00:42:21.007
What's a
nervous breakdown?

831
00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:23.076
Don't worry
about it. just eat.

832
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.778
Truman. how in the world

833
00:42:24.811 --> 00:42:26.813
do you make such a
big mess every time?

834
00:42:26.847 --> 00:42:27.681
- Come here.
- Hey!

835
00:42:30.117 --> 00:42:31.685
- What?
- That was mine!

836
00:42:31.718 --> 00:42:34.154
- Oh. I don't think so.
- It was on my plate.

837
00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:35.956
- What was?
- My roll.

838
00:42:35.989 --> 00:42:39.126
- What roll?
- Hey. why did you do that?

839
00:42:39.159 --> 00:42:42.062
- I do what I want.
- Don't worry Iris.

840
00:42:42.095 --> 00:42:43.497
I will get you another roll.

841
00:42:45.233 --> 00:42:46.767
But dad took mine.

842
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.503
Because dad wanted that one.

843
00:42:49.536 --> 00:42:52.539
Don't worry. dad is gonna
get in trouble for that one.

844
00:42:52.572 --> 00:42:54.274
- What?
- Dad. don't have

845
00:42:54.307 --> 00:42:56.409
to be such a donkey dick.

846
00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:59.346
Whoa. who taught
you that word?

847
00:42:59.379 --> 00:43:00.580
From you two.

848
00:43:00.614 --> 00:43:01.948
Okay. you can't say
that word anymore.

849
00:43:01.982 --> 00:43:03.683
- Why not?
- Because it's a really mean

850
00:43:03.717 --> 00:43:04.785
and bad word.

851
00:43:04.818 --> 00:43:06.453
Well then. don't take my roll.

852
00:43:07.988 --> 00:43:10.123
Fair enough.
let's shake on it.

853
00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:13.059
Dad. do you
wanna play with me?

854
00:43:13.093 --> 00:43:14.194
Not tonight. buddy.

855
00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:16.496
Tonight. I'm
playing video games.

856
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.430
Can I play?

857
00:43:17.464 --> 00:43:19.599
Nope. it's a grown up game.

858
00:43:19.633 --> 00:43:21.101
I can play a grown up game.

859
00:43:21.134 --> 00:43:23.904
No. no. no. this is just for
me guys. maybe another time.

860
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:25.372
- We want to play.
- Uh uh.

861
00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:26.840
- We want to play.
- You guys.

862
00:43:26.873 --> 00:43:28.675
- We want to play.
- This is my night.

863
00:43:28.708 --> 00:43:31.444
- We want to play.
- We want to play.

864
00:43:31.478 --> 00:43:32.379
- We want.
- We want.

865
00:43:32.412 --> 00:43:33.647
Hi. what can I get ya?

866
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.048
Hi. can I just get
one double espresso.

867
00:43:35.081 --> 00:43:36.284
Sure thing.

868
00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:38.084
- Adam. one double espresso.
- Yeah.

869
00:44:14.154 --> 00:44:15.989
Adam?

870
00:44:16.022 --> 00:44:17.691
Hello. Adam.

871
00:44:17.724 --> 00:44:20.727
Hello. are you there?

872
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.829
- Hi!
- Sydney. hey.

873
00:44:22.863 --> 00:44:26.199
what can I do for you?

874
00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:27.500
How did the morning go?

875
00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:29.237
Oh. it was good.

876
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.770
A little crazy. but it was good.

877
00:44:30.804 --> 00:44:32.439
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

878
00:44:32.472 --> 00:44:34.242
He messed up a lot.

879
00:44:34.275 --> 00:44:35.942
It's okay. he'll get it.

880
00:44:35.976 --> 00:44:37.644
I think we'll keep him.

881
00:44:38.778 --> 00:44:41.448
Oh boom. no
soldier left behind.

882
00:44:47.255 --> 00:44:48.455
Are you okay?

883
00:44:48.488 --> 00:44:51.325
Yeah. I just didn't
like that joke just now.

884
00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.561
Oh. sorry.

885
00:44:54.594 --> 00:44:56.096
No. it's not your fault.

886
00:44:56.129 --> 00:44:58.565
My dad was a soldier

887
00:44:58.598 --> 00:45:02.135
and he died overseas
a few months ago so.

888
00:45:02.168 --> 00:45:03.103
Oh my gosh.

889
00:45:03.136 --> 00:45:06.106
I'm really sorry.

890
00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:07.540
I should not have said that.

891
00:45:08.508 --> 00:45:12.012
I got you so good.

892
00:45:12.045 --> 00:45:13.347
Wait. that was a joke?

893
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:14.814
You're too easy. man.

894
00:45:14.848 --> 00:45:17.851
Dude. dead dad joke. not cool.

895
00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:20.553
But really. how did
the morning rush go?

896
00:45:20.587 --> 00:45:23.257
Well you know. I did learn
something pretty big today.

897
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:24.991
- Yeah?
- Yeah. you would be alarmed

898
00:45:25.025 --> 00:45:26.426
and I'm talking alarmed

899
00:45:26.459 --> 00:45:28.662
about how many guys
use the restroom

900
00:45:28.695 --> 00:45:30.063
and don't wash their hands.

901
00:45:30.096 --> 00:45:31.498
No. no. no. no.

902
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:32.666
you would be surprised

903
00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:34.734
at how many girls
don't wash their hands.

904
00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:36.370
- Really?
- Really.

905
00:45:36.404 --> 00:45:38.205
I mean. guys are
generally so gross.

906
00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:39.706
I expect more from the girls.

907
00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:41.242
No.

908
00:45:41.275 --> 00:45:42.842
You know. the no washers
are definitely disgusting.

909
00:45:42.876 --> 00:45:44.778
but I think I found
something worse today.

910
00:45:44.811 --> 00:45:47.480
- What?
- The over washer.

911
00:45:47.514 --> 00:45:49.182
So I went to the
restroom. right?

912
00:45:49.216 --> 00:45:54.120
And there was a fellow employee
who will remain unnamed

913
00:45:54.154 --> 00:45:55.555
and he was doing
his pee pee time.

914
00:45:55.588 --> 00:45:57.258
And then he goes
to wash his hands.

915
00:45:57.291 --> 00:45:59.893
I go do my pee pee time and
then I go wash my hands.

916
00:45:59.926 --> 00:46:01.828
He's still there washing
his hands mind you.

917
00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:03.496
which isn't really a big deal.

918
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:05.899
I wash my hands for the
normal amount of time

919
00:46:05.932 --> 00:46:06.733
for washing your hands.

920
00:46:06.766 --> 00:46:08.269
Which is?

921
00:46:08.302 --> 00:46:11.838
Which is singing happy birthday.
generally that timeframe.

922
00:46:11.871 --> 00:46:13.407
Okay. go on.

923
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:18.346
Anyway. so I finish up and
Todd is still scrubbing away

924
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.513
and I'm just like what
happened over there?

925
00:46:20.547 --> 00:46:22.916
Like he was leaving a
crime scene at the urinal?

926
00:46:22.949 --> 00:46:25.085
Yeah. like what did you
touch in your nether regions

927
00:46:25.118 --> 00:46:27.821
to justify that
much hand-washing?

928
00:46:27.854 --> 00:46:30.324
Stop being a bully.

929
00:46:30.358 --> 00:46:33.227
I will be doing orders in
the back if you need me.

930
00:46:45.572 --> 00:46:47.274
All right kids.
it's time to go.

931
00:46:51.644 --> 00:46:54.315
At least try to clean up
around here or something?

932
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:57.351
Love you guys. have fun today.

933
00:46:58.518 --> 00:47:00.920
I'm really not
happy with the choices

934
00:47:00.954 --> 00:47:02.756
that you're making right now.

935
00:47:02.789 --> 00:47:04.325
Love you too hun.

936
00:47:04.358 --> 00:47:06.793
I wanna stay home
with daddy and have fun.

937
00:47:06.826 --> 00:47:09.896
Oh. but then it
wouldn't be fun anymore.

938
00:47:09.929 --> 00:47:10.930
All right kids. let's go.

939
00:47:10.964 --> 00:47:12.766
Let's go get in the car.

940
00:47:12.799 --> 00:47:13.700
Okay.

941
00:47:13.733 --> 00:47:14.934
Come on. time to get in the car.

942
00:47:14.968 --> 00:47:16.437
Time to go

943
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.904
Let's go you stinker.

944
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:55.443
Dude. I
can't shake this girl.

945
00:47:55.476 --> 00:47:56.343
The manager girl?

946
00:47:56.377 --> 00:47:57.844
Yeah. it's weird.

947
00:47:57.877 --> 00:48:00.046
I've never had feelings
for anyone other than Jen.

948
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.915
And now I already feel
like I'm cheating on her.

949
00:48:01.948 --> 00:48:03.716
Dude. it is no big deal.

950
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.220
It's just like I can't
stop thinking about her.

951
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:09.423
I feel like I'm in
high school again.

952
00:48:09.457 --> 00:48:11.157
Like that time you
tried to kiss Becky

953
00:48:11.191 --> 00:48:13.026
while she was in the
middle of taking a test?

954
00:48:13.059 --> 00:48:16.096
No. no. this is more like in between the
time I tried to ask out that deaf girl

955
00:48:16.129 --> 00:48:18.798
and the time I got broken up with one
of my girlfriends in the skating room.

956
00:48:18.832 --> 00:48:21.569
Yeah. you look
really. really cute.

957
00:48:26.373 --> 00:48:28.242
To this day. I
haven't been skating.

958
00:48:28.275 --> 00:48:30.211
You need to get laid.

959
00:48:30.244 --> 00:48:32.446
- Stop it.
- No. you know what I mean.

960
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.047
You're too wound
up and you know it.

961
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.015
Look. I actually
feel really good.

962
00:48:36.049 --> 00:48:37.650
This whole doing
whatever I want thing

963
00:48:37.684 --> 00:48:38.918
is really working for me.

964
00:48:38.952 --> 00:48:40.720
- Well. I have an idea.
- What?

965
00:48:40.753 --> 00:48:43.923
- Let's set you up on Tinder.
- Tinder?

966
00:48:43.957 --> 00:48:46.726
Oh no. I am not ready for that.

967
00:48:46.759 --> 00:48:48.895
Come on man. this is
all part of your idea.

968
00:48:48.928 --> 00:48:50.797
You got to test the
waters. experiment?

969
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.898
- No. no.
- Hand your phone.

970
00:48:51.931 --> 00:48:53.166
- Matt.
- Hand me your phone.

971
00:48:53.199 --> 00:48:55.201
- Okay Matt. come on.
- Hand me your phone.

972
00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:56.736
- Dude.
- Hand me your phone.

973
00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:01.641
This is your burner
phone. right?

974
00:49:01.674 --> 00:49:03.109
My burner phone?

975
00:49:03.143 --> 00:49:04.711
Yeah. you can't have
two lives with one phone.

976
00:49:04.744 --> 00:49:06.514
I have to have two phones now?

977
00:49:06.547 --> 00:49:08.449
How else do you think
we're gonna do this

978
00:49:08.482 --> 00:49:09.483
without you getting caught?

979
00:49:09.517 --> 00:49:10.884
I don't even wanna do this.

980
00:49:10.917 --> 00:49:12.152
Okay. you know what?

981
00:49:12.185 --> 00:49:13.920
Take yours. we'll set
up your Tinder account

982
00:49:13.953 --> 00:49:15.188
on my primary phone

983
00:49:15.222 --> 00:49:16.756
and then there's no
way Jen will catch you.

984
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:19.326
Okay yeah. this logic
is riddled with reason.

985
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.761
Smile!

986
00:49:21.794 --> 00:49:24.731
All right. now what is
something interesting about you?

987
00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:29.736
Hey Connor. what is
something interesting about me?

988
00:49:31.938 --> 00:49:32.772
I don't know.

989
00:49:33.907 --> 00:49:36.843
Okay.

990
00:49:37.877 --> 00:49:40.481
Hello. oh hey.

991
00:49:41.814 --> 00:49:43.983
Wait. you have a
violin recital already?

992
00:49:44.984 --> 00:49:47.288
Oh. are you excited?

993
00:49:48.522 --> 00:49:49.557
You are so awesome.

994
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.760
No sorry. I can't make it.

995
00:49:53.793 --> 00:49:57.964
Yeah. daddy's got to work
even at night pumpkin.

996
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:01.067
All right. all right.
you're gonna kill it though.

997
00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.001
You do good.

998
00:50:02.902 --> 00:50:05.406
Love you. bye bye.

999
00:50:07.807 --> 00:50:09.075
Lying to your kids now?

1000
00:50:10.477 --> 00:50:12.045
Okay. so what happens next?

1001
00:50:12.078 --> 00:50:13.581
What are you doing?

1002
00:50:13.614 --> 00:50:15.449
Scrolling through people's
profiles and clicking like.

1003
00:50:15.482 --> 00:50:16.983
Wait. do they know
you're doing that?

1004
00:50:17.016 --> 00:50:19.152
Yeah. it sends
them notification.

1005
00:50:19.185 --> 00:50:20.654
Okay well. I wanna see.

1006
00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:22.755
Oh no. no. no. no. no.
no. you are no good at this.

1007
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:24.658
You can't even come up with
the top five celebrity list.

1008
00:50:24.692 --> 00:50:26.527
Okay well. if I'm supposed
to like these people.

1009
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.262
I at least should
pick them. yeah?

1010
00:50:29.729 --> 00:50:31.532
Okay. but I get
to hold the phone.

1011
00:50:32.765 --> 00:50:37.770
Fine. okay no. no.

1012
00:50:38.838 --> 00:50:40.374
Her nose is too big.

1013
00:50:40.407 --> 00:50:43.677
- What?
- No. no. no. pass that one.

1014
00:50:43.711 --> 00:50:46.879
Okay no. too much
makeup. my goodness.

1015
00:50:46.913 --> 00:50:48.047
That's a low hairline.

1016
00:50:49.516 --> 00:50:51.418
Nope. oh no. nope.

1017
00:50:52.386 --> 00:50:53.420
No. swipe. no.

1018
00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:56.590
Oh. her eyebrows are
so close together.

1019
00:50:56.624 --> 00:50:58.091
She's cute.

1020
00:50:58.124 --> 00:51:01.262
Quasimodo. pass. pass.

1021
00:51:01.295 --> 00:51:02.296
Oh. hello buck teeth.

1022
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:03.530
Okay. come on man.

1023
00:51:03.564 --> 00:51:04.565
- What?
- You're saying no

1024
00:51:04.598 --> 00:51:05.798
to every girl.

1025
00:51:05.832 --> 00:51:08.369
Well. yeah. 'cause
they're not right.

1026
00:51:09.769 --> 00:51:11.672
How did you even get one
girl to fall in love with you?

1027
00:51:11.705 --> 00:51:15.141
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means you're being too picky that's what it means.

1028
00:51:15.174 --> 00:51:16.410
It means that you
don't even understand

1029
00:51:16.443 --> 00:51:17.645
what a beautiful
girl looks like.

1030
00:51:17.678 --> 00:51:19.613
Look at this girl.
she's gotta to be what.

1031
00:51:19.647 --> 00:51:20.780
an eight at least?

1032
00:51:20.813 --> 00:51:22.249
I don't like her haircut.

1033
00:51:22.283 --> 00:51:24.551
You're not gonna be bone
storming her hair cut.

1034
00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:26.387
Well. if that's how she
takes care of the upstairs.

1035
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.021
who knows what the
downstairs looks like?

1036
00:51:28.054 --> 00:51:29.556
Sometimes that's a good thing.

1037
00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:32.158
It's good to explore
some creative downstairs.

1038
00:51:32.191 --> 00:51:33.694
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1039
00:51:33.727 --> 00:51:35.194
You know what.

1040
00:51:35.229 --> 00:51:36.563
you couldn't have gotten
a match with her anyways.

1041
00:51:36.597 --> 00:51:40.933
Oh okay. okay yeah. go
ahead and like that one.

1042
00:51:40.967 --> 00:51:42.436
I'll show you.

1043
00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:46.806
Like it. or swipe. or push
the yes I want this button.

1044
00:51:47.974 --> 00:51:51.578
- Just tell her yes. come on.
- Liked.

1045
00:51:53.681 --> 00:51:57.150
Goodness. so
what happens next?

1046
00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:00.654
Well next. you wait to
see if you're lucky enough

1047
00:52:00.688 --> 00:52:03.424
for her to give you a like
and then you have a match.

1048
00:52:03.457 --> 00:52:04.824
Don't worry about it.

1049
00:52:04.857 --> 00:52:07.093
I'll start some conversations.
get you a date or two.

1050
00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:09.929
This actually could
be a lot of fun.

1051
00:52:09.962 --> 00:52:11.632
Well. I'm glad that my
love life just brings you

1052
00:52:11.665 --> 00:52:13.400
so much entertainment.

1053
00:52:13.434 --> 00:52:14.735
It really does.

1054
00:52:14.768 --> 00:52:16.270
It's kind of like a
video game or something.

1055
00:52:16.303 --> 00:52:17.604
All right. I gotta go.

1056
00:52:18.806 --> 00:52:20.574
Oh hey. I should
head out with you.

1057
00:52:20.607 --> 00:52:22.842
I got a third date with
this chick tonight.

1058
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:24.611
I'm hoping tonight's
gonna be the night.

1059
00:52:24.645 --> 00:52:26.413
a little bone storming.

1060
00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:29.216
Dude. how do you keep lying to
your wife and getting away with it?

1061
00:52:29.249 --> 00:52:30.718
I don't know.

1062
00:52:38.592 --> 00:52:41.127
Betty White.

1063
00:52:53.273 --> 00:52:54.708
Hello. beautiful.

1064
00:53:00.247 --> 00:53:01.013
I love it.

1065
00:53:03.717 --> 00:53:04.685
She'll like it.

1066
00:53:18.164 --> 00:53:19.899
I think you've arrived.

1067
00:53:21.235 --> 00:53:22.436
What are you talking about?

1068
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:24.137
You're a full on
millennial. bro.

1069
00:53:25.171 --> 00:53:26.273
You think so?

1070
00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:28.174
Only one thing left to do.

1071
00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:29.343
What?

1072
00:53:29.376 --> 00:53:31.345
You gotta give Sydney
the old naked hug.

1073
00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:34.615
Dude no. I can't.

1074
00:53:34.648 --> 00:53:36.949
Come on. years from now.

1075
00:53:36.983 --> 00:53:39.653
you don't wanna tell your
kids you went part millennial.

1076
00:53:39.686 --> 00:53:41.789
You wanna go full millennial.

1077
00:53:41.822 --> 00:53:45.426
Carpe diem. just do it.
the time is now baby!

1078
00:53:45.459 --> 00:53:47.761
Yeah. rousing
speech Shakespeare.

1079
00:53:47.795 --> 00:53:49.897
Okay. then just go
on a date with her.

1080
00:53:49.929 --> 00:53:52.800
No. I'll still feel like
a majorly cheating on Jen.

1081
00:53:52.833 --> 00:53:54.835
Think about it this way.

1082
00:53:54.868 --> 00:53:56.904
it's not like you're
taking another job.

1083
00:53:56.936 --> 00:53:58.839
It's just like you're
going on an interview.

1084
00:54:02.676 --> 00:54:03.510
So you'll do it?

1085
00:54:04.912 --> 00:54:06.680
- Okay. perfect.
- Wait dude.

1086
00:54:06.713 --> 00:54:08.282
what are you doing?

1087
00:54:09.316 --> 00:54:11.919
- Hey Mikayla. right?
- Sydney.

1088
00:54:11.951 --> 00:54:12.853
Oh. that's what I meant.

1089
00:54:12.886 --> 00:54:14.120
Yeah look. my name's Matt.

1090
00:54:14.153 --> 00:54:15.722
I think you know my
friend Adam. right?

1091
00:54:15.756 --> 00:54:16.757
I think so.

1092
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:17.990
Okay look. I'm trying

1093
00:54:18.024 --> 00:54:19.192
to set up this little
double date thing

1094
00:54:19.226 --> 00:54:20.461
I'm not that good
at planning though.

1095
00:54:20.494 --> 00:54:21.662
I'm wondering if you
wanted to come over

1096
00:54:21.695 --> 00:54:23.129
and maybe we could
figure something out?

1097
00:54:23.162 --> 00:54:24.298
I guess I could.

1098
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:25.332
Cool. come on over.

1099
00:54:25.365 --> 00:54:26.800
- I'll follow your lead.
- Okay.

1100
00:54:30.771 --> 00:54:33.172
So. double date huh?

1101
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:37.711
Is your wing man gonna
be doing all the talking

1102
00:54:37.744 --> 00:54:38.846
for you as well?

1103
00:54:38.879 --> 00:54:40.347
Whoa. I'm not
actually gonna be going.

1104
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.683
our buddy Connor is gonna
go with your friend.

1105
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:48.020
Well. tell your friend that
I will see him there at seven.

1106
00:54:48.054 --> 00:54:50.257
Oh and maybe make
him some flash cards

1107
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.693
so he has something to say.

1108
00:54:52.726 --> 00:54:53.894
Right. right. right.

1109
00:54:53.927 --> 00:54:55.229
Dude. you got a date
with your crush.

1110
00:54:55.262 --> 00:54:56.396
but you can't screw this one up

1111
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.898
'cause it's work romance too

1112
00:54:57.931 --> 00:54:59.800
and that could look
bad for everyone.

1113
00:54:59.833 --> 00:55:02.034
- Dude. why aren't you gonna be there?
- All part of the plan my man.

1114
00:55:02.068 --> 00:55:03.537
See with Connor there.

1115
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:05.973
you are gonna look like a
knight in shining armor.

1116
00:55:06.005 --> 00:55:10.644
Odd dates. why. why. why!

1117
00:55:19.185 --> 00:55:21.989
Is that gonna be me if
the date doesn't go well?

1118
00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:23.790
I think your
break's about done.

1119
00:55:23.824 --> 00:55:24.925
Yeah. yeah.

1120
00:55:34.868 --> 00:55:35.969
Where are you going?

1121
00:55:36.937 --> 00:55:38.739
Out with the guys.

1122
00:55:38.772 --> 00:55:41.708
Well. since you seem to
be making all the decisions

1123
00:55:41.742 --> 00:55:43.544
for us. do you wanna tell me

1124
00:55:43.577 --> 00:55:45.379
how we're gonna pay
for these bills?

1125
00:55:47.381 --> 00:55:49.449
I don't know. take
it out of our savings.

1126
00:55:49.483 --> 00:55:50.384
What savings?

1127
00:55:52.386 --> 00:55:54.288
Let's pay with a credit card.

1128
00:55:54.321 --> 00:55:57.056
Okay. I consider myself
to be a pretty chill wife

1129
00:55:57.089 --> 00:55:58.825
and I hate how I'm
turning into a nag.

1130
00:55:58.859 --> 00:55:59.993
Well then. don't nag.

1131
00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:03.397
I feel like I have to.

1132
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.966
We have a responsibility to
provide for our children.

1133
00:56:05.999 --> 00:56:07.568
something which you seem
to have forgotten about.

1134
00:56:07.601 --> 00:56:09.670
You know what.
I got another job

1135
00:56:09.703 --> 00:56:11.204
so we should be able
to make it work.

1136
00:56:11.238 --> 00:56:13.206
Right. minimum wage plus tips.

1137
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.708
Yeah. doesn't quite cut it.

1138
00:56:14.741 --> 00:56:17.311
I am sorry I finally found
something that I enjoy doing.

1139
00:56:17.344 --> 00:56:20.047
All right. well
this little experiment

1140
00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:21.515
is putting a strain on things.

1141
00:56:21.548 --> 00:56:24.051
Nope. and this is no
longer an experiment dear.

1142
00:56:24.083 --> 00:56:25.986
I actually enjoy
being a millennial.

1143
00:56:26.019 --> 00:56:28.755
Yeah. you like it because you get
to do whatever the hell you want.

1144
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:29.923
And what's wrong with that?

1145
00:56:29.957 --> 00:56:31.858
You made a decision
to have a family

1146
00:56:31.892 --> 00:56:34.093
and I hate to break it to you.
but you don't get to do

1147
00:56:34.126 --> 00:56:36.162
what you want all
the time for forever.

1148
00:56:36.195 --> 00:56:37.664
Sure I can.

1149
00:56:37.698 --> 00:56:39.566
I married you because you
had your head on straight.

1150
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.503
You were patient and you were
mature and loving and selfless

1151
00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:46.105
which are tremendous attributes
for a father and a husband.

1152
00:56:46.138 --> 00:56:47.574
And this whole new outlook

1153
00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:49.476
that you have can only
go so far before you have

1154
00:56:49.509 --> 00:56:50.711
to make a big decision.

1155
00:56:50.744 --> 00:56:51.979
Oh. what's that?

1156
00:56:52.012 --> 00:56:53.413
If you wanna keep
your family or not.

1157
00:57:09.496 --> 00:57:10.330
Oh yeah.

1158
00:57:12.833 --> 00:57:14.034
Dude. you're disgusting.

1159
00:57:14.067 --> 00:57:16.536
What. I gotta eat or
else I'm gonna get sick.

1160
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.872
And if I get sick. none of us
are gonna have a good time.

1161
00:57:18.905 --> 00:57:20.240
I already feel sick.

1162
00:57:20.273 --> 00:57:22.109
No. you're just
nervous and it's okay.

1163
00:57:22.141 --> 00:57:24.211
I mean. I was nervous the
first time too when you know.

1164
00:57:24.244 --> 00:57:25.712
Dude. I'm not nervous sick.

1165
00:57:25.746 --> 00:57:27.146
I actually just don't feel good.

1166
00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:29.383
And you realize this
isn't my first time right?

1167
00:57:29.416 --> 00:57:31.418
I've been married for 10
years and I have two kids.

1168
00:57:31.451 --> 00:57:33.787
You don't have to throw your
accomplishments in my face.

1169
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.522
- Why did you wear that stupid shirt?
- It's not a stupid shirt.

1170
00:57:35.555 --> 00:57:37.324
You're a stupid shirt.

1171
00:57:37.357 --> 00:57:38.258
You want some?

1172
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:39.993
No. we're about to eat dinner.

1173
00:57:45.365 --> 00:57:47.934
- Hello ladies.
- Hello.

1174
00:57:47.968 --> 00:57:49.069
This is Keira.

1175
00:57:49.102 --> 00:57:50.404
- Hi.
- Hi Keira

1176
00:57:50.437 --> 00:57:53.240
This is Connor.

1177
00:57:53.273 --> 00:57:55.142
Okay. I guess we'll sit down.

1178
00:57:57.611 --> 00:58:01.415
So. can we get you
ladies anything to drink?

1179
00:58:01.448 --> 00:58:03.417
Sure. that'd be nice.

1180
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.952
Neither of you are like
wishy-washy fems. right?

1181
00:58:09.256 --> 00:58:10.624
You know. like there's
hardcore feminists

1182
00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:11.858
that are all about equal rights.

1183
00:58:11.892 --> 00:58:13.192
but then there's the
wishy-washy ones.

1184
00:58:13.226 --> 00:58:14.728
What's the difference?

1185
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:17.030
Okay well. the wishy-washys
are fighting for equal rights

1186
00:58:17.064 --> 00:58:19.366
but they also expect
traditional chivalry on dates.

1187
00:58:19.399 --> 00:58:21.868
You know. like opening doors and paying
for the meals or something like that.

1188
00:58:21.902 --> 00:58:23.370
I'm just like. you're
trying to have the best

1189
00:58:23.403 --> 00:58:25.939
of both worlds and you
can't have it both ways.

1190
00:58:25.972 --> 00:58:27.708
We're fine paying
for our half.

1191
00:58:27.741 --> 00:58:28.909
Oh good. thanks.

1192
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.713
No. I was actually
just kidding.

1193
00:58:33.947 --> 00:58:36.049
Just making a
stupid observation.

1194
00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:37.150
He does that a lot.

1195
00:58:37.984 --> 00:58:39.419
I can't help it.

1196
00:58:39.453 --> 00:58:40.787
There's just a lot of
stupid things to observe.

1197
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.726
Well. what about me?

1198
00:58:46.727 --> 00:58:48.295
Is anything stupid about me?

1199
00:58:50.664 --> 00:58:53.500
Nope. no. there's
nothing stupid about you.

1200
00:58:53.533 --> 00:58:58.138
You're just beautiful. and
smart. and funny and good.

1201
00:59:00.974 --> 00:59:02.342
So what about you Connor?

1202
00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:06.379
What do you wanna know?

1203
00:59:06.413 --> 00:59:08.982
I'm just trying to get
to know you a little bit.

1204
00:59:09.015 --> 00:59:11.852
Well. what would
you like to know?

1205
00:59:12.919 --> 00:59:15.188
- What do you do for work?
- Fine. go ahead and ask that.

1206
00:59:15.223 --> 00:59:16.723
Excuse me?

1207
00:59:16.757 --> 00:59:20.360
Jeez. what's with all the
vague what you do questions?

1208
00:59:20.393 --> 00:59:21.762
Get to the point Karen.

1209
00:59:21.795 --> 00:59:23.130
Oh my God.

1210
00:59:23.163 --> 00:59:24.364
Keira. he is a joke.

1211
00:59:24.397 --> 00:59:26.099
We're just gonna head
to the little boy's room

1212
00:59:26.133 --> 00:59:27.467
and freshen up okay?

1213
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:28.468
That's disgusting.
we don't need

1214
00:59:28.502 --> 00:59:29.870
to know about your details.

1215
00:59:29.903 --> 00:59:31.071
I'm talking about
me and you buddy.

1216
00:59:31.104 --> 00:59:32.005
Oh no. I'm good.

1217
00:59:32.038 --> 00:59:33.440
Okay. we'll be right back.

1218
00:59:37.043 --> 00:59:38.645
Dude. what the hell are
you doing out there?

1219
00:59:38.678 --> 00:59:41.515
Relax. it's a
part of my strategy.

1220
00:59:41.548 --> 00:59:43.583
Your strategy
is to berate them.

1221
00:59:43.617 --> 00:59:45.452
No. no. no. no. no.
I'm not gonna rape her.

1222
00:59:45.485 --> 00:59:47.521
Oh my God. no berate. berate.

1223
00:59:47.554 --> 00:59:49.322
Look. I act like I don't care.

1224
00:59:49.356 --> 00:59:50.991
like I'm not interested in her

1225
00:59:51.024 --> 00:59:53.227
and it makes her
want me even more.

1226
00:59:53.261 --> 00:59:55.729
So the more act like
I don't want her.

1227
00:59:55.762 --> 00:59:57.197
then she's gonna love it.

1228
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:59.933
I'm like. I don't want her.
but then she wants this.

1229
00:59:59.966 --> 01:00:02.969
Dude. you're taking
it too far all right>

1230
01:00:03.003 --> 01:00:04.604
- Okay. fine.
- Tone it down.

1231
01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:08.708
Oh my God. I think I gotta shit.

1232
01:00:08.742 --> 01:00:10.410
My goodness. my
stomach hurts so bad.

1233
01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:12.045
See. you should've
ate before we came.

1234
01:00:12.078 --> 01:00:15.582
Shut the hell. get out there
and make nice. all right?

1235
01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:17.551
Stop being such a doofus.

1236
01:00:17.584 --> 01:00:18.618
Did you just flick me?

1237
01:00:18.652 --> 01:00:19.486
Get out there.

1238
01:00:31.531 --> 01:00:32.332
What?

1239
01:00:37.537 --> 01:00:38.738
Son of a bitch!

1240
01:00:48.448 --> 01:00:50.083
Son of a bitch!

1241
01:00:50.116 --> 01:00:51.451
What's your dog's name?

1242
01:00:51.484 --> 01:00:52.552
Felix.

1243
01:00:52.586 --> 01:00:55.289
- That's quite the name.
- I know.

1244
01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:02.429
Okay. so they seem to be
getting along a lot better.

1245
01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:05.932
I ordered for
you. I hope that's okay.

1246
01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:08.034
Oh yeah. what'd you get me?

1247
01:01:08.068 --> 01:01:09.337
Pig's feet.

1248
01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:10.537
Oh really?

1249
01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:11.938
Yeah. the waiter says
they're really good

1250
01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.307
so I just went with it.

1251
01:01:19.713 --> 01:01:21.548
Tell me about yourself.

1252
01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:23.284
something that's
not work-related?

1253
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:27.387
Well. I'm from Michigan

1254
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.522
and I still have a
sister that's back there

1255
01:01:29.556 --> 01:01:31.091
with my mom and dad.

1256
01:01:31.124 --> 01:01:33.526
Okay. why did
you move out here?

1257
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.595
I wanted to new experiences.

1258
01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:39.966
I like mixing things up you
know. keeping life interesting.

1259
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.803
Plus Michigan is
a bit of a hole.

1260
01:01:43.837 --> 01:01:46.039
like a hell frozen
over kind of hole.

1261
01:01:47.774 --> 01:01:48.575
Why?

1262
01:01:49.976 --> 01:01:52.479
The town I'm from.
people just. I don't know.

1263
01:01:52.512 --> 01:01:55.649
they stayed the same as
they were in high school.

1264
01:01:55.682 --> 01:01:57.351
Not a lot of growth or change

1265
01:01:57.385 --> 01:02:00.086
and I guess I just realized

1266
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.289
that I wanted to explore life

1267
01:02:01.322 --> 01:02:04.491
and I want different
places around the world

1268
01:02:04.524 --> 01:02:06.459
to help shape who I am.

1269
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.766
Lately. I kind of
feel like I've gotten

1270
01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:15.403
into like just a rut.

1271
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:20.073
My life is just the same routine

1272
01:02:20.106 --> 01:02:23.043
like all my other high
school friends back home.

1273
01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:24.412
Yeah. you have.

1274
01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:27.647
Okay. how would you know that?

1275
01:02:29.015 --> 01:02:31.718
You have kept everything
safe and consistent.

1276
01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:33.186
I'll have you know

1277
01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.889
that I was quite the party
animal back in my day.

1278
01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:37.358
- Oh really?
- Hmm hmm.

1279
01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:39.960
All right guys.
who's flexible?

1280
01:02:39.993 --> 01:02:43.697
I got not one but
two games of twister.

1281
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:46.233
You eat the same thing
for lunch every day.

1282
01:02:46.267 --> 01:02:49.337
Okay. so you're keeping
tabs on my lunches now?

1283
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:50.170
What can I say?

1284
01:02:50.203 --> 01:02:51.171
I'm a lunch stalker.

1285
01:02:53.673 --> 01:02:56.344
Gosh. I envy you.

1286
01:02:57.278 --> 01:02:58.078
How so?

1287
01:02:59.579 --> 01:03:04.117
You're just carefree and
you do whatever you want.

1288
01:03:04.985 --> 01:03:06.119
Life is short.

1289
01:03:06.152 --> 01:03:07.887
I mean. do what makes
you happy right?

1290
01:03:09.556 --> 01:03:10.724
What makes you happy?

1291
01:03:14.362 --> 01:03:17.298
New experiences. exploring.

1292
01:03:18.665 --> 01:03:19.699
meeting new people.

1293
01:03:21.901 --> 01:03:25.772
What I love most of all is
doing things I'm afraid of.

1294
01:03:27.974 --> 01:03:29.042
That is so awesome.

1295
01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:33.713
That's disgusting.

1296
01:03:33.747 --> 01:03:36.217
Oh. you're serious.

1297
01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.351
I'm sorry. no. no. no.

1298
01:03:37.385 --> 01:03:38.252
You weren't supposed
to see that.

1299
01:03:38.285 --> 01:03:39.487
Keira. what's wrong?

1300
01:03:39.519 --> 01:03:41.489
He has pictures of
his poop on his phone.

1301
01:03:44.392 --> 01:03:45.658
Wow. gross.

1302
01:03:45.692 --> 01:03:48.094
Yeah. he does
actually have those.

1303
01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:48.962
Come on Syd.

1304
01:03:50.096 --> 01:03:52.032
Reschedule. I guess?

1305
01:03:52.065 --> 01:03:52.899
Yeah.

1306
01:03:55.969 --> 01:03:56.803
Cool.

1307
01:03:58.905 --> 01:04:03.009
Everybody poops. it was a
little nugget like a little nut.

1308
01:04:03.043 --> 01:04:04.878
- Dude!
- I didn't show the big stuff.

1309
01:04:04.911 --> 01:04:08.282
- Oh my God!
- It's okay. you want a roll?

1310
01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:11.551
- No.
- There's a lot of them left.

1311
01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:16.689
I think we should all
have crowns on. don't you?

1312
01:04:16.723 --> 01:04:18.292
- Hmm hmm.
- No. you don't want a crown?

1313
01:04:18.325 --> 01:04:20.261
- Hmm hmm.
- Look I think they're...

1314
01:04:20.294 --> 01:04:21.194
What are those?

1315
01:04:21.228 --> 01:04:22.296
They're eating giant fruit.

1316
01:04:22.329 --> 01:04:24.465
- that's almost the size-
- Giant pears.

1317
01:04:34.508 --> 01:04:35.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

1318
01:04:35.742 --> 01:04:37.610
Sorry. my roommate's sleeping.

1319
01:04:37.644 --> 01:04:38.446
Let's go over here.

1320
01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:39.313
Oh sorry.

1321
01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:42.715
What's up?

1322
01:04:43.983 --> 01:04:46.920
I just wanted to apologize.

1323
01:04:46.953 --> 01:04:50.990
That is not how I
wanted this date to go.

1324
01:04:51.024 --> 01:04:53.327
It's fine. it's
not your fault.

1325
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.095
And Keira's just a
bit overdramatic.

1326
01:04:55.128 --> 01:04:59.132
- So everyone poops.
- Exactly.

1327
01:04:59.165 --> 01:05:01.801
I mean. just not everyone
takes pictures of it.

1328
01:05:02.969 --> 01:05:04.505
Right. right. yeah.

1329
01:05:05.772 --> 01:05:09.809
I am sorry about my friend.

1330
01:05:09.843 --> 01:05:12.078
Connor can be a
real tool sometimes.

1331
01:05:13.646 --> 01:05:16.749
I really wanted to go on
a proper date with you.

1332
01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:17.617
Me too.

1333
01:05:26.993 --> 01:05:27.827
I should go.

1334
01:05:29.095 --> 01:05:30.331
You don't have to.

1335
01:05:30.364 --> 01:05:33.666
I mean. you could
stay or whatever.

1336
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.875
I should probably go.

1337
01:06:01.362 --> 01:06:04.231
Are you sure you
don't wanna stay?

1338
01:06:04.265 --> 01:06:05.599
You can come in.

1339
01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:13.440
No. I'll just catch you later.

1340
01:06:16.876 --> 01:06:17.710
Okay.

1341
01:11:03.297 --> 01:11:05.332
How long have I been gone?

1342
01:11:05.365 --> 01:11:06.867
Too long I guess.

1343
01:11:12.104 --> 01:11:14.875
Is this just
some scare tactic?

1344
01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:17.277
This is math.

1345
01:11:17.311 --> 01:11:19.713
We can't even afford next
month's mortgage payment.

1346
01:11:26.986 --> 01:11:28.020
Where are the kids?

1347
01:11:29.823 --> 01:11:30.657
At my mom's.

1348
01:11:32.091 --> 01:11:33.293
We'll stay there

1349
01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:34.895
for a while until we can
find a smaller place.

1350
01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:40.901
Is there room for me there?

1351
01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:43.470
Not currently.

1352
01:11:48.542 --> 01:11:52.312
Look. I can get another job

1353
01:11:54.248 --> 01:11:56.884
or maybe try to get
my old job back.

1354
01:11:59.253 --> 01:12:00.787
If you're not happy
with me and the kids.

1355
01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:02.656
what's the point of
dragging this out?

1356
01:12:06.693 --> 01:12:09.128
Don't you think you're
rushing into this a bit?

1357
01:12:11.532 --> 01:12:13.233
Iris was devastated
when you didn't show up

1358
01:12:13.267 --> 01:12:15.101
to her violin recital.

1359
01:12:15.134 --> 01:12:16.537
She cried a lot.

1360
01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:17.771
You made your daughter cry

1361
01:12:17.804 --> 01:12:20.106
because you just want
her to go out and play.

1362
01:12:20.139 --> 01:12:21.608
You used to be there and
you're just not anymore.

1363
01:12:21.642 --> 01:12:23.142
And I don't wanna
fight with you.

1364
01:12:23.175 --> 01:12:24.645
I don't wanna argue with you.

1365
01:12:27.079 --> 01:12:29.283
I wanna do what's
best for the kids.

1366
01:12:29.316 --> 01:12:32.486
And I can't live with this
behavior as a pattern.

1367
01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:39.259
It looks like I
screwed this one up.

1368
01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:47.768
Care if I take these?

1369
01:12:51.738 --> 01:12:53.740
Whatever you want Adam.

1370
01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:14.761
Hey sorry it's so early.

1371
01:13:15.796 --> 01:13:16.964
I thought you were...

1372
01:13:18.565 --> 01:13:19.600
Is everything okay?

1373
01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:23.904
No. I wouldn't say
everything's okay.

1374
01:13:24.838 --> 01:13:27.240
Well. what's going on?

1375
01:13:28.342 --> 01:13:30.744
You knew about
it before I did.

1376
01:13:30.777 --> 01:13:31.712
So you tell me?

1377
01:13:38.619 --> 01:13:41.021
How did you find out?

1378
01:13:41.054 --> 01:13:43.189
Found a message in
one of his phones.

1379
01:13:47.794 --> 01:13:50.731
Look Maddie. I am sorry.

1380
01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:51.665
That I found out

1381
01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:54.768
or that I've been cheated on.

1382
01:13:57.704 --> 01:13:59.873
It looks like we're
headed towards divorce.

1383
01:14:01.308 --> 01:14:04.411
Matt doesn't even seem to care
that he hurt me or the kids.

1384
01:14:04.444 --> 01:14:06.780
He told me he was
glad he was caught.

1385
01:14:06.813 --> 01:14:08.849
Look. Maddie he-

1386
01:14:08.882 --> 01:14:10.751
- That bastard could do
whatever the hell he wants.

1387
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:15.555
I hope you
know what you're doing.

1388
01:14:15.589 --> 01:14:17.057
Dude. I know what I'm doing.

1389
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:18.792
There's this little chica
that I met the other night.

1390
01:14:18.825 --> 01:14:20.027
It worked out well.

1391
01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.329
Do you wanna make some
old fashions for dinner.

1392
01:14:22.362 --> 01:14:23.463
make a night of it?

1393
01:14:23.497 --> 01:14:24.398
You need to slow down.

1394
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:26.165
Hey Adam. come on in buddy.

1395
01:14:26.198 --> 01:14:27.401
You didn't text us back

1396
01:14:27.434 --> 01:14:28.769
so we weren't sure
if you were coming.

1397
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:30.971
What is this?

1398
01:14:31.004 --> 01:14:32.105
We're celebrating.

1399
01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:45.852
Hey man. I actually
just came from your house.

1400
01:14:45.886 --> 01:14:47.087
Ah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1401
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.824
Marriage is over. I'm
finally free so come on.

1402
01:14:52.025 --> 01:14:53.794
What are you gonna
do about your kids?

1403
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:56.530
I don't know.

1404
01:14:56.563 --> 01:14:58.632
Maddie will just keep 'em.

1405
01:15:01.702 --> 01:15:04.304
Hey man. I actually
really like Maddie.

1406
01:15:06.073 --> 01:15:08.575
You don't know what
the hell you're doing.

1407
01:15:08.608 --> 01:15:12.112
I mean. she's okay but
now I can do whatever I want

1408
01:15:12.145 --> 01:15:14.181
so we're celebrating.

1409
01:15:19.986 --> 01:15:20.987
You're an asshole.

1410
01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:28.729
And you guys. you're assholes
for doing whatever this is

1411
01:15:28.762 --> 01:15:30.330
and I'm an asshole.

1412
01:15:37.337 --> 01:15:40.574
I can't believe I
actually wanted this.

1413
01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:45.213
We're hurting people.

1414
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:50.317
People that we should
care about the most.

1415
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:51.852
And yeah. I can't.

1416
01:17:01.021 --> 01:17:03.224
Adam. haven't seen
you for a while.

1417
01:17:06.227 --> 01:17:09.563
Yeah. yeah that's
basically why I'm here.

1418
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:12.266
What can I help you with?

1419
01:17:16.304 --> 01:17:19.606
Well. I don't really
have anybody to turn to

1420
01:17:19.639 --> 01:17:23.311
and I basically
need some advice.

1421
01:17:24.177 --> 01:17:25.111
Of course.

1422
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:34.020
So it looks like prepentance
doesn't really work.

1423
01:17:38.091 --> 01:17:41.728
I did all of these things
that I knew were wrong

1424
01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:45.932
and now I just feel
worse than I ever have.

1425
01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:49.636
My wife already
wants to leave me

1426
01:17:50.971 --> 01:17:55.108
and I just feel like
a terrible person.

1427
01:17:58.279 --> 01:18:01.349
So what do I do?

1428
01:18:02.283 --> 01:18:05.219
- Repentance.
- Repentance?

1429
01:18:05.253 --> 01:18:07.988
Repentance. go fix everything.

1430
01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:10.457
Go make amends as best you can.

1431
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:14.628
Say sorry to all those you
offended. especially your wife.

1432
01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:22.836
So it's almost like
repentance for prepentance.

1433
01:18:24.905 --> 01:18:27.407
Let's just drop the
prepentance term. okay?

1434
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.077
Fair enough. thanks Father.

1435
01:18:33.247 --> 01:18:34.748
See you at church on Sunday?

1436
01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:41.187
Yeah. yeah. I'll be there.

1437
01:19:30.203 --> 01:19:33.173
Hello everyone. this
is my first time

1438
01:19:38.346 --> 01:19:42.148
and probably my last
time going live.

1439
01:19:48.356 --> 01:19:52.125
Well. the thing is I'm
actually going live

1440
01:19:52.158 --> 01:19:53.927
but this message
is actually only

1441
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.231
for my wife and my kids so.

1442
01:19:58.732 --> 01:20:01.835
Oh wow. hey Jake.

1443
01:20:04.204 --> 01:20:05.739
Thumbs up to you too Shelly.

1444
01:20:07.907 --> 01:20:10.543
Okay. I can see
why people do this.

1445
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:17.017
Anyways. a couple months ago.

1446
01:20:21.654 --> 01:20:25.592
I decided to be a jerk.

1447
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:32.266
I was feeling trapped

1448
01:20:32.299 --> 01:20:37.304
and feeling like I
didn't have my own life

1449
01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:43.810
or that I was doing anything
that was just for me.

1450
01:20:47.981 --> 01:20:52.353
I did some pretty wrong things.

1451
01:20:54.187 --> 01:20:55.722
The grass isn't always greener.

1452
01:20:59.326 --> 01:21:00.960
The grass is actually
luscious green

1453
01:21:00.994 --> 01:21:02.195
with my family

1454
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:06.800
and I temporarily
lost sight of that.

1455
01:21:11.272 --> 01:21:15.209
Jen. if you're watching this.

1456
01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:19.979
I'm really sorry.

1457
01:21:24.851 --> 01:21:27.754
And I hope that
you can forgive me

1458
01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:34.361
and that you can give
me the chance to try

1459
01:21:34.395 --> 01:21:37.063
and earn your love
and respect again.

1460
01:21:38.932 --> 01:21:42.369
I promise that I will
be a better husband

1461
01:21:43.803 --> 01:21:48.608
and father than I was before
this whole experiment of mine.

1462
01:21:52.745 --> 01:21:53.547
I love you.

1463
01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:42.463
So you just don't like it?

1464
01:22:42.496 --> 01:22:43.631
Yeah. it isn't me.

1465
01:22:45.865 --> 01:22:47.834
I don't really
know what we can do.

1466
01:22:47.867 --> 01:22:51.539
I've never had someone try
to return a car before.

1467
01:22:51.572 --> 01:22:53.374
Well. you've also never
had someone buy a car

1468
01:22:53.407 --> 01:22:54.941
from you before.

1469
01:22:54.974 --> 01:22:56.743
A lot of firsts
between you and me.

1470
01:23:00.113 --> 01:23:02.115
Would you want another car?

1471
01:23:02.148 --> 01:23:03.651
I think I'll just
take my old car back

1472
01:23:03.683 --> 01:23:04.684
if that's okay with you.

1473
01:23:07.555 --> 01:23:09.989
My father-in-law's gonna
be so flipping PO'd.

1474
01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:19.333
Wait. if I sell you
your old car back

1475
01:23:20.767 --> 01:23:23.304
that still counts
as a sale. right?

1476
01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:27.006
Well. look at
you growing all up.

1477
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.343
All right. so why don't
you sell me my car

1478
01:23:29.376 --> 01:23:31.144
for the same price I
sold it to you for.

1479
01:23:31.177 --> 01:23:33.247
and then I'll
return this new car

1480
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.549
for a slightly less price.

1481
01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:36.417
Seem fair?

1482
01:23:37.251 --> 01:23:38.452
Boy. I'll say.

1483
01:23:38.485 --> 01:23:41.388
All right. put it
here buddy. yeah!

1484
01:23:42.956 --> 01:23:44.258
Hey. your shoe's untied.

1485
01:24:00.173 --> 01:24:01.741
Oh. I've missed you.

1486
01:24:19.493 --> 01:24:22.829
Oh Fluffy!

1487
01:24:24.498 --> 01:24:29.503
That is just one
curious little critter.

1488
01:24:33.274 --> 01:24:35.108
Oh. I can't believe.

1489
01:24:44.884 --> 01:24:46.819
Yeah. I don't think
he's coming back.

1490
01:24:54.728 --> 01:24:58.931
Maybe you could you do like a
little service or something?

1491
01:25:14.748 --> 01:25:16.049
I'm gonna go.

1492
01:25:18.885 --> 01:25:20.321
Have a good day guys.

1493
01:25:22.456 --> 01:25:23.923
I'm sorry about that.

1494
01:25:41.974 --> 01:25:45.546
- Hey.
- Hey.

1495
01:25:49.182 --> 01:25:54.187
I was thinking that we
should talk about last week.

1496
01:25:55.556 --> 01:25:57.725
Yeah. that might be good.

1497
01:26:00.093 --> 01:26:04.631
Yeah. so I shouldn't have
done that. kissed you. I mean.

1498
01:26:11.438 --> 01:26:13.873
Oh yeah. I mean
probably not a good idea

1499
01:26:13.906 --> 01:26:15.342
to dip in the company ink.

1500
01:26:16.909 --> 01:26:19.246
Right. yeah. yeah that too.

1501
01:26:21.415 --> 01:26:22.583
What do you mean?

1502
01:26:22.616 --> 01:26:23.916
What?

1503
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:26.754
- What's the too?
- The too?

1504
01:26:26.787 --> 01:26:29.155
Yeah. I said it's not
good for co-workers to date

1505
01:26:29.188 --> 01:26:31.325
and you said. "Yeah. that too."

1506
01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:32.326
I'm not following. I'm sorry?

1507
01:26:32.359 --> 01:26:33.594
What's your too?

1508
01:26:33.627 --> 01:26:35.729
The other reason why
we shouldn't hook up?

1509
01:26:37.664 --> 01:26:39.400
You know. if you're gonna
dump me like a child.

1510
01:26:39.433 --> 01:26:41.200
then at least give me
the truth like an adult.

1511
01:26:41.235 --> 01:26:42.935
Okay. I didn't dump
you like a child.

1512
01:26:42.969 --> 01:26:46.005
Really I mean. called in
sick. avoided me for three days.

1513
01:26:46.038 --> 01:26:47.940
And every time you
went to the bathroom.

1514
01:26:47.974 --> 01:26:50.844
you'd go outside around
the back corner just

1515
01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:52.346
to avoid passing my desk.

1516
01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:55.081
Okay. so now you're keeping
tabs on my bathroom habits?

1517
01:26:55.114 --> 01:26:56.417
Yeah. I'm a pee stalker.

1518
01:26:58.918 --> 01:27:00.587
Come on. just tell me. okay?

1519
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:02.222
It's cool. we're gonna be fine.

1520
01:27:02.256 --> 01:27:03.357
It was just a kiss.

1521
01:27:08.295 --> 01:27:12.366
So you remember that
woman I came in with?

1522
01:27:12.399 --> 01:27:13.233
Yeah.

1523
01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:19.606
So she is my wife.

1524
01:27:30.183 --> 01:27:31.117
You're married?

1525
01:27:35.856 --> 01:27:39.793
Wow. you're married
and you didn't tell me?

1526
01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:42.362
Yeah. yeah.

1527
01:27:42.396 --> 01:27:43.963
You know. that's a
pretty messed up situation

1528
01:27:43.996 --> 01:27:45.131
to put me in. right?

1529
01:27:46.132 --> 01:27:47.166
Wait. what?

1530
01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.335
You made me an adulterer.

1531
01:27:48.368 --> 01:27:50.237
No. no. no. no.
you're not an adulterer.

1532
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:52.306
Well. at least an
accomplice to adultery.

1533
01:27:52.339 --> 01:27:54.441
You made me the
other woman Adam.

1534
01:27:54.475 --> 01:27:56.042
Okay. but it was just a kiss.

1535
01:27:56.075 --> 01:27:57.377
It wasn't even a big deal.

1536
01:27:57.411 --> 01:27:59.413
Yeah. a kiss is no big
deal. but with a married man

1537
01:27:59.446 --> 01:28:00.814
that's totally different.

1538
01:28:00.848 --> 01:28:04.150
Okay. okay yeah.
I am really sorry.

1539
01:28:05.117 --> 01:28:06.787
Have you told your wife?

1540
01:28:07.888 --> 01:28:10.290
Not exactly.

1541
01:28:11.425 --> 01:28:13.293
Okay. you're a
total piece of shit.

1542
01:28:14.728 --> 01:28:18.130
Yeah. yeah. I am aware and
I actually agree with you.

1543
01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:22.669
My dad cheated on my mom

1544
01:28:22.703 --> 01:28:25.405
and then left us to be
with his new girlfriend.

1545
01:28:25.439 --> 01:28:27.674
I don't have a lot of
respect for cheaters.

1546
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:33.914
Well. at least your dad is
still alive right?

1547
01:28:36.984 --> 01:28:40.320
You know. like the joke
about your dad being dead?

1548
01:28:41.889 --> 01:28:44.358
Speaking of death. I
actually killed a cat today.

1549
01:28:46.727 --> 01:28:50.230
Choose your moments
Adam. you're fired.

1550
01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:51.130
Yeah. I got it.

1551
01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:56.303
Oh. nice shot.

1552
01:29:11.952 --> 01:29:14.788
- Hey man.
- What's up?

1553
01:29:14.821 --> 01:29:16.122
Security lets you in here?

1554
01:29:17.089 --> 01:29:18.190
Yeah. I snuck in.

1555
01:29:19.326 --> 01:29:20.994
Ratchett will be
pissed if he sees you.

1556
01:29:21.028 --> 01:29:22.729
Yeah. I think
he'll come around.

1557
01:29:24.798 --> 01:29:28.502
Hey. I wanted to talk to
you about the other day.

1558
01:29:28.535 --> 01:29:29.937
I got nothing.

1559
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:33.307
Okay yeah. all right
look. it's on me. all right?

1560
01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.173
It's all on me.

1561
01:29:35.976 --> 01:29:38.312
I want to apologize

1562
01:29:38.345 --> 01:29:42.549
for attacking you
on your special day.

1563
01:29:42.583 --> 01:29:45.419
Dude. you just used bunny
ears on my special day.

1564
01:29:45.452 --> 01:29:47.086
That can't possibly
mean you're sorry.

1565
01:29:47.119 --> 01:29:51.258
I'm sorry. I realized I
don't respect your decision.

1566
01:29:51.291 --> 01:29:54.093
Oh. you're knocking this apology
out of the party slugger.

1567
01:29:54.126 --> 01:29:56.463
What works for you
just doesn't work for me.

1568
01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:59.566
but hey. I'll always love you.

1569
01:30:03.135 --> 01:30:06.138
Thanks. but this
is what I want.

1570
01:30:07.574 --> 01:30:12.579
Yeah. yeah. this is your path
and I can't join you on it.

1571
01:30:13.614 --> 01:30:14.615
It's your thing.

1572
01:30:14.648 --> 01:30:16.249
It's definitely not mine.

1573
01:30:18.885 --> 01:30:20.186
I totally kissed Syd.

1574
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.023
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

1575
01:30:23.056 --> 01:30:23.857
What the hell?

1576
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:25.092
Tell me about it.

1577
01:30:25.124 --> 01:30:26.326
I mean. there's
nothing to say.

1578
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.127
I just went to her
place after the date

1579
01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.030
and it kinda just happened.

1580
01:30:30.063 --> 01:30:31.231
How was it?

1581
01:30:31.264 --> 01:30:33.300
I mean. it was
pretty good I guess.

1582
01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:34.334
Anything else?

1583
01:30:34.368 --> 01:30:36.503
No. no. I told
her I had to go.

1584
01:30:36.536 --> 01:30:37.371
A little chug though?

1585
01:30:37.404 --> 01:30:38.338
- Oh my gosh.
- Yes?

1586
01:30:38.372 --> 01:30:39.573
Maybe a little.

1587
01:30:39.606 --> 01:30:41.074
Things were changing down there.

1588
01:30:41.108 --> 01:30:44.444
But the point is. it was
very quick and it was wrong.

1589
01:30:44.478 --> 01:30:46.913
And I felt terrible.

1590
01:30:46.947 --> 01:30:47.914
You're crazy. man.

1591
01:30:49.116 --> 01:30:50.117
You have a black eye?

1592
01:30:51.418 --> 01:30:53.253
Did you tell Jennifer?

1593
01:30:53.286 --> 01:30:57.090
No. no. no. this is Syd.

1594
01:30:57.124 --> 01:30:59.726
She didn't know I
was married and just.

1595
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.863
Oh. that's hilarious.

1596
01:31:02.896 --> 01:31:04.698
So that means you're
unemployed now?

1597
01:31:05.832 --> 01:31:08.635
No. actually I
got my old job back.

1598
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:11.004
Please. please. please.
please. please. please. please

1599
01:31:11.038 --> 01:31:13.006
please. please. please.
please. please. please. please

1600
01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.776
please. please. please.
please. please. please. please

1601
01:31:15.809 --> 01:31:17.878
please. please. please.
please. please. please. please

1602
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:21.415
please. please.
please. please. please.

1603
01:31:21.448 --> 01:31:24.151
Wait. so are you
going to tell Jen?

1604
01:31:24.183 --> 01:31:28.422
Well yeah. yeah.
I'm taking care

1605
01:31:28.455 --> 01:31:29.790
of my other mistakes first.

1606
01:31:29.823 --> 01:31:31.858
And I'm saving the
big one for last.

1607
01:31:31.892 --> 01:31:33.160
- Dude come on.
- What?

1608
01:31:34.061 --> 01:31:34.928
Don't woos out.

1609
01:31:34.961 --> 01:31:36.730
go tell her right now.

1610
01:31:36.763 --> 01:31:37.664
Right now?

1611
01:31:37.698 --> 01:31:39.900
Right now man. right now.

1612
01:31:39.933 --> 01:31:41.768
Come on. you said it yourself.

1613
01:31:41.802 --> 01:31:44.771
you're better than me. right?

1614
01:31:44.805 --> 01:31:46.206
Yeah.

1615
01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:48.308
Go make sure you
save your family.

1616
01:31:50.277 --> 01:31:52.145
- All right. okay.
- Go!

1617
01:31:52.179 --> 01:31:53.113
- All right.
- Go!

1618
01:31:53.146 --> 01:31:54.715
Yes all right. thank you. yes.

1619
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:57.551
Do you accept my apology?

1620
01:32:00.153 --> 01:32:01.488
- Yeah.
- Hmm hmm.

1621
01:32:04.758 --> 01:32:06.960
I love you both so much.

1622
01:32:06.993 --> 01:32:09.763
You're coming to my next
violin recital. right?

1623
01:32:09.796 --> 01:32:12.632
I won't miss it for anything.

1624
01:32:12.666 --> 01:32:14.701
Okay. hey buddy.

1625
01:32:14.735 --> 01:32:17.003
I gotta go talk
to your mom. okay.

1626
01:32:17.037 --> 01:32:18.138
- Okay.
- You guys can stay

1627
01:32:18.171 --> 01:32:19.940
in here for a minute?

1628
01:32:19.973 --> 01:32:21.074
- Hmm hmm.
- Hmm hmm.

1629
01:32:21.108 --> 01:32:22.309
I gotta go apologize.

1630
01:32:22.342 --> 01:32:23.243
- Okay.
- Okay.

1631
01:32:23.276 --> 01:32:24.311
All right. love you guys.

1632
01:32:24.344 --> 01:32:25.612
Love you too.

1633
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:39.359
- Hey.
- Hey.

1634
01:32:43.396 --> 01:32:45.298
What happened to your face.

1635
01:32:45.332 --> 01:32:48.769
Oh. millennialism.

1636
01:32:53.607 --> 01:32:54.775
I need to talk to you.

1637
01:32:54.808 --> 01:32:55.909
Yeah. I know.

1638
01:32:55.942 --> 01:32:56.743
I saw your live.

1639
01:32:59.546 --> 01:33:00.347
And?

1640
01:33:03.283 --> 01:33:04.384
It was really sweet.

1641
01:33:08.555 --> 01:33:09.389
But?

1642
01:33:12.425 --> 01:33:15.128
But actions speak
louder than words.

1643
01:33:15.162 --> 01:33:19.366
Well. curiosity killed
the cat. all right?

1644
01:33:21.568 --> 01:33:23.670
- I'm a cat. I got killed.
- No. I get it.

1645
01:33:26.373 --> 01:33:31.378
Hey. I got my old job back.

1646
01:33:32.879 --> 01:33:34.314
And are you gonna be happy?

1647
01:33:35.849 --> 01:33:38.185
I'm happy knowing you
and the kids are happy.

1648
01:33:39.486 --> 01:33:41.255
I know. but I want
you to be happy.

1649
01:33:41.289 --> 01:33:42.689
I am. I am.

1650
01:33:42.722 --> 01:33:45.259
I was just in a funk.

1651
01:33:45.293 --> 01:33:47.228
Okay. okay. okay. come here.

1652
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:48.595
Sit down please.

1653
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.036
Listen. I'm gonna be honest.

1654
01:33:56.069 --> 01:33:58.338
Okay. I liked a lot

1655
01:33:58.371 --> 01:34:00.974
of the changes I made over
this last month or so.

1656
01:34:01.007 --> 01:34:03.076
It was really fun to
do whatever I wanted.

1657
01:34:04.811 --> 01:34:07.315
But then. I had a breakthrough

1658
01:34:08.548 --> 01:34:13.086
and I realized that
it's not worth it.

1659
01:34:14.754 --> 01:34:16.890
I realized that doing what
I wanted would just end

1660
01:34:16.923 --> 01:34:20.994
with me being alone and
I don't wanna be alone.

1661
01:34:22.429 --> 01:34:24.998
I don't wanna be without
you and the kids. I don't.

1662
01:34:27.133 --> 01:34:31.339
I want things just to go back
to the way they were. okay?

1663
01:34:31.371 --> 01:34:35.408
But. this time I want
complete honesty.

1664
01:34:35.442 --> 01:34:38.378
just everything out
on the table 100%.

1665
01:34:39.512 --> 01:34:44.218
So I have something
that I need to.

1666
01:34:52.592 --> 01:34:57.597
I sort of cheated on you.

1667
01:34:58.198 --> 01:34:59.432
Okay. that's it.

1668
01:34:59.466 --> 01:35:01.067
It was just a kiss. nothing else.
And I put an end to it.

1669
01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:02.502
It's completely over. okay.

1670
01:35:02.535 --> 01:35:03.503
Never again. honey.

1671
01:35:05.705 --> 01:35:07.507
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1672
01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:14.915
Wow. I think it was the
right thing to tell me.

1673
01:35:21.521 --> 01:35:23.156
I'm so sorry. honey.

1674
01:35:24.557 --> 01:35:26.693
I mean. I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

1675
01:35:28.962 --> 01:35:31.431
Honestly. I feel a
little bit relieved.

1676
01:35:31.464 --> 01:35:33.600
I mean. so the thing is.

1677
01:35:35.001 --> 01:35:37.570
I've been cheating on you
for the last few years

1678
01:35:37.604 --> 01:35:39.539
but it was more than kissing.

1679
01:35:46.846 --> 01:35:49.749
I thought we were just being
honest with each other.

1680
01:35:51.419 --> 01:35:53.220
Can you say something?

1681
01:35:53.254 --> 01:35:55.555
Just say something.

1682
01:35:55.588 --> 01:35:56.790
Are we gonna be okay?

1683
01:36:01.528 --> 01:36:03.029
Can you say something?

1684
01:36:06.766 --> 01:36:10.003
What the f-

1685
01:39:56.729 --> 01:39:59.132
I'm really sorry. okay?

1686
01:39:59.165 --> 01:40:00.401
But we can't see
each other anymore.

1687
01:40:00.434 --> 01:40:02.236
I need to focus on my marriage.

1688
01:40:05.406 --> 01:40:06.773
But I really like you.

1689
01:40:06.806 --> 01:40:07.707
I know

1690
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:08.942
Like in a lust kind of way.

1691
01:40:08.975 --> 01:40:10.678
I thought it was-

1692
01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:12.712
- I mean love maybe but.

1693
01:40:12.745 --> 01:40:14.548
Did you say in a
less kind of way?

1694
01:40:14.582 --> 01:40:15.616
Like in a lust.

1695
01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:16.550
- Oh. lust?
- Yeah.

1696
01:40:16.584 --> 01:40:18.319
Yeah. I'm very aware of that.

1697
01:40:18.352 --> 01:40:19.719
I'm very in lust with you.
