00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.078
-Hi. How you doing?
-Dad. this is Peter.

5
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.812
[Peter 1]
You know who I am--

6
00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.514
your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

7
00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:15.049
I didn't believe it at first.

8
00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:17.818
When they called initially.
I was like. "Finally."

9
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.019
[laughing]

10
00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:20.988
The nerd in me.
the fanboy in me.

11
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.224
on so many levels. said yes.

12
00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.060
To be here today with you two.
it's. like. mind-blowing.

13
00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.230
-[Ned] Peter.
-[all] Yeah?

14
00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.831
Oh. sorry. did you mean...

15
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.700
[Watts] I don't remember
where the idea started.

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.901
but just talking through it.

17
00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.503
it was like.
"That would be crazy.

18
00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.838
That's impossible.
How do we do it?"

19
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.507
All right. let's get to work!

20
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.275
This character moves me

21
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.444
in a way that
very few things do.

22
00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:46.247
To see this come together
was really moving to me.

23
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.184
Wow. This is going to be
deeply special for people.

24
00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:52.120
and for me. as a fan.

25
00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:54.288
and I just feel
incredibly grateful.

26
00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:57.225
It's like nearly
20 years worth of cinema
coming together for one film.

27
00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.193
[Feige]
To now sit back and watch that
is really amazing.

28
00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:00.594
Hello.

29
00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:02.296
Am I becoming an
elder statesman? Maybe I am.

30
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.065
[Holland] It warranted
the biggest solo superhero movie

31
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.934
that's ever been made.

32
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.270
[Pascal]
It's a continuum of Spider-Man.

33
00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.739
All of these movies
are now part of the same thing.

34
00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:14.242
-You're getting on my nerves.
-I have a knack for that.

35
00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:15.776
[bystander]
Knock it off. man! No!

36
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.412
It's so layered.

37
00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.614
It's so nostalgic
and opens up the multiverse

38
00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:22.816
-and allows for us to have--
-[insect buzzing]

39
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.485
I didn't catch it.

40
00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.920
It's worthy of Spider-Man.

41
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.924
I want Spider-Man!

42
00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.661
It was nice to be able to have
everything coalesce into.

43
00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:34.828
at its essence.

44
00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.131
this simple story of Spider-Man.

45
00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:39.967
Whoo-hoo!

46
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.509
What up. web slingers?

47
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.778
This is my good friend
Martin Starr.

48
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:52.580
This is my good buddy
J.B. Smoove.

49
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.182
You want the first shift
or the second?

50
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:55.583
I could take either.

51
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.951
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

52
00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.120
We welcome you to
All Roads Lead to No Way Home.

53
00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.756
a look back at 20 years
of the Spider-Man movies.

54
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.657
Whoo!

55
00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:08.095
-Nice knowing you. Spider-Man.
-Wait. excuse me?

56
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.830
The entire world's
about to forget

57
00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.365
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

58
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.269
[Starr] Introduced by the great
Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

59
00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:19.440
in the pages of Amazing Fantasy.
number 15. way back in 1962.

60
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:23.277
Spider-Man wowed
comic book readers at the time
and never looked back.

61
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.778
[Smoove] Whoo!

62
00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.615
Spawning everything
from cartoons to Underoos--

63
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:28.949
I had a pair of Underoos--

64
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.319
to eight films and counting.

65
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.721
Here we go.

66
00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.557
[Doctor Strange shouts]

67
00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:39.960
-[grunts]
-[gasps. pants]

68
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.695
What just happened?

69
00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.698
[Starr] It all began with the
original Tobey Maguire trilogy

70
00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:46.634
from the early 2000s.

71
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.470
which set a new standard
for how superhero movies
should operate.

72
00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.739
[Feige] Those early
Tobey Maguire-Sam Raimi

73
00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:53.641
Spidey films

74
00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.076
were very influential on me
as a filmmaker.

75
00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.980
Sam understood these movies
in a way that is very profound.

76
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.884
It's like a character study
within this superhero film.

77
00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:07.921
Go get 'em. tiger.

78
00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:12.092
[Smoove] And then came

79
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.728
the Andrew Garfield
Amazing Spider-Man reboot.

80
00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:18.198
blending slick visual style
with more immersive action

81
00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:21.669
while bringing some all-time
great Spider-Man bad guys

82
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.904
to the big screen
for the first time.

83
00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.907
[Starr] An amazing sequel
would follow.

84
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.742
and then something
incredible happened.

85
00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.111
I gotta go. I gotta go!

86
00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.514
[Starr] Spider-Man joined
the highly successful
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

87
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.882
Hey. everyone.

88
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.350
[Starr]
To direct their new film.

89
00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.619
series producers turned
to director Jon Watts.

90
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:42.556
whose series really
gets back to the character's
high school roots.

91
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.058
injecting his stories
with youth. humor

92
00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.695
and massive MCU-sized action.

93
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.430
[Watts]
It's great to just go back.

94
00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.400
figuring out any other things
that we could connect.

95
00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.802
'cause I just want it
to be a complete world.

96
00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.904
so that in the end.
it does feel like one story.

97
00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.573
I just love Spider-Man.
and I want to do it justice.

98
00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:02.075
Now. Watts definitely
has the Midas touch.

99
00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.544
Action!

100
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.212
[Smoove] Including
having the foresight to cast

101
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.881
two incredibly talented
supporting actors

102
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.651
who elevate
everything they touch.

103
00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.219
[Starr] Zendaya and Jacob.

104
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.554
That must be
who you're talking about.

105
00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.156
Whoa. hey. look.
I appreciate you. bro.

106
00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:19.126
I'm talking about us. Martin.
They're great.

107
00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.462
What?
You and me!
[laughing]

108
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.331
-[Starr] Oh. yeah. right.
I mean. we're pretty great.
-[bell dings]

109
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.432
That is false.

110
00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:25.799
What'd I tell you

111
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.100
about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

112
00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.736
Mr. Harrington
and Mr. Dell do

113
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.604
a lot of the heavy lifting
in the recent films.

114
00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.306
Mr. Dell and I
have it under control!

115
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.274
Oh. no. no!
Don't drag me into this. Roger!

116
00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:36.076
I'm doing my best. Julius!

117
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.745
[Starr] But this isn't
just about us.

118
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.681
This is about getting
the folks at home up to speed

119
00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.350
on the Spider-Man movie history.
Whoa.

120
00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:44.452
You are absolutely right.
Thank you.

121
00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:49.156
Because a hero's work
is never done! [whooshes]

122
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.524
That sounds familiar.

123
00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:51.559
[whooshes]

124
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.730
I believe there's a hero
in all of us.

125
00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:59.333
Gives us strength.

126
00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:01.802
Even though sometimes
we have to give up

127
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.337
the thing we want the most.

128
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:07.808
You have a gift.
You have power.

129
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.677
Are you going to
step up or not?

130
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.145
I don't know if that's me.
I'm not Iron Man.

131
00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.548
[thunder rumbling]

132
00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:17.117
-I made a choice.
-[Peter 1] It's my gift.

133
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.852
[Peter 2] This is my path.

134
00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.054
[Peter 3] This is my chance
to prove myself.

135
00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.024
-Who am I?
-[Osborn] Peter.

136
00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.693
-Peter!
-Hello. Peter.

137
00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.561
[Peter 1]
I'm just Peter Parker.

138
00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.965
[chuckles]
Spidey's suits change.

139
00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.701
and evil villains
come and go.

140
00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.404
but there's always been
one constant anchoring

141
00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:38.305
all the Spider-Man films.

142
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:42.009
-and that's the one and only
Peter Parker.
-Heard of him.

143
00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:43.644
[Holland] People think
Spider-Man is a man.

144
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.878
that he's this grown superhero.

145
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.414
but he's really not.

146
00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.181
He's a kid with
everyday kid problems.

147
00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.817
[Peter 3] What's up. guys?

148
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.353
Peter Parker is such
an international character

149
00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:57.190
because I believe that
there is a Peter Parker
in all of us.

150
00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:58.926
They love me.

151
00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.729
Peter Parker brings something
to everybody. doesn't he?

152
00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.363
Yes! [laughs]

153
00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:04.865
[Garfield] I think
the essence of Peter Parker

154
00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:06.166
is gonna be constant.

155
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.536
no matter how
the character is played.

156
00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.505
That fundamental idea that.
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

157
00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.173
and Peter's trying to use
it do the right thing.

158
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.209
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

159
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.879
And I'm still broke.
[chuckles]

160
00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:19.813
[chuckles]

161
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.015
[Smoove] Back in 2002.

162
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.251
Tobey Maguire became
the first actor

163
00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.220
to bring Peter Parker to life
on the big screen.

164
00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.757
[Maguire] I just was looking
at this character.

165
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.360
and Sam's vision
and then how I read the script

166
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.928
and what
I wanted to do with him.

167
00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.565
and then sometimes
I'd put on tights

168
00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:39.867
and get on wires and stuff.

169
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.604
Audiences were immediately
drawn to his likable.
off-kilter delivery...

170
00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:44.872
Okay.

171
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:45.839
[Smoove]
...and transformed physique.

172
00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:48.041
[grunts]

173
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.644
It is a bit like
jumping out of a plane

174
00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.947
and figuring out
how the chute works
on your way down.

175
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.717
Whoo-hoo!

176
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.987
[Feige]
It's about finding the soul
of the character in a performer.

177
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.155
and that's what
Sam did with Tobey.

178
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.157
and that's what
we've strived to do

179
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:06.159
on all of our MCU films since.

180
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.928
And Tobey really showcased that.

181
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.130
He was embracing the core
of what the character was

182
00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.231
from the comics.

183
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.466
I forgive you.

184
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.802
[Smoove]
Five years later.

185
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.404
the baton was passed to
British actor Andrew Garfield.

186
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.741
who played Peter Parker
in two Amazing Spider-Man films.

187
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.110
[Starr]
A self-professed Spider-fan.

188
00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:24.645
Garfield landed
his dream gig.

189
00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:28.482
I had to fight a lizard today.

190
00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:30.584
but it was not
an ordinary lizard.

191
00:07:30.618 --> 00:07:34.755
Did you know he even did yoga
and pilates to gain flexibility

192
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.857
when striking
those famous Spidey poses?

193
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.192
-Oh. yeah.
-The one where he puts
his legs like this?

194
00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.529
Or when he jumps
from a building
and lands like this?

195
00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:44.665
[Starr] Don't pop your hip out.
We got a lot more to do here.

196
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.869
[Smoove] Well. I need
to be all limbered up

197
00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.437
to properly introduce

198
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.641
the third and current
incarnation of Peter Parker.

199
00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:55.509
-My man...
-Tom Holland!

200
00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:58.145
[Starr]
An accomplished British actor

201
00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.680
as well as an experienced dancer

202
00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.515
capable of doing
many of his own stunts.

203
00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:03.551
[grunts]
[crew member]
That was better.

204
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:07.555
[Starr] Tom has taken
the role of Peter/Spidey
and run with it.

205
00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:10.157
redefining the character for
a whole new generation of fans.

206
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.560
What makes Tom
so good and genuine

207
00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:15.663
is that he performs Spider-Man
with his whole body.

208
00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:17.064
[Smoove] Yeah. man.

209
00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:19.499
And under my expert
mentorship and tutelage.

210
00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.569
Tom gives you
the total package--

211
00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:25.639
charisma. humor.
relatability. vulnerability.

212
00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:27.641
those signature
sophomoric quips.

213
00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:31.278
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

214
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.446
[grunts. shouts]

215
00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:35.215
[grunts]

216
00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.950
That's so good!
[laughs]

217
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.426
When they put all three of us
on camera for the first time

218
00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.595
in our suits.

219
00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.830
we all just burst out laughing.

220
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.332
Just kind of spontaneously.
all looking at each other

221
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.568
like. "This is so weird.
but I love it."

222
00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:57.037
[Garfield] It was like
me and Tobey arrived.

223
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.006
and all of their arms
were just kind of open.

224
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.842
So we were just. like. enfolded
into the nucleus with them.

225
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.777
It's like Spider-Man heaven.

226
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.914
I felt really connected
and really appreciated.

227
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:10.350
There was a sense
of coming back to something.

228
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:14.554
and working with Andrew and Tom

229
00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.156
was really dear to me.

230
00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.192
[Feige] The interaction
and the respect

231
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:23.096
between Tobey Maguire and
Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland

232
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.132
is really something.

233
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.834
I think I can...

234
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:30.303
[all laughing]

235
00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:33.406
[Holland] To see them
in their suits and
to laugh and joke

236
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.744
and swap stories
about their experiences
and my experiences.

237
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.546
that has been the highlight
of my Spider-Man career.

238
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.115
getting to share it
with those guys.

239
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.285
[Garfield] It resulted in this
very. very beautiful experience

240
00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:49.156
where I got to have
a bit more closure on something

241
00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.958
that means so much to me.

242
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.425
Are you okay?

243
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.262
[Watts] I liked the idea
that they show up

244
00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:57.931
helping Peter complete his arc
and to make the right decision

245
00:09:57.965 --> 00:10:00.100
and maybe not make
the mistakes that they made.

246
00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.069
But along the way. you know.

247
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.104
they get some closure as well

248
00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:06.106
and some catharsis
on their story lines.

249
00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:08.341
I love you guys.

250
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.612
Thank you.
Thank you.

251
00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.315
All right. let's do this.
Let's go.

252
00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.023
[chuckles] Pumpkin bomb.

253
00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:25.125
I love me some Spider-Man.

254
00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:27.327
but I freaking love
all the crazy villains.

255
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.595
You know what I mean?

256
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.330
The Green Goblin. Electro.

257
00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.834
that disco-ball-headed guy
with the Mexican wrestling name.

258
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.136
-My name is Mysterio.
-[Ned. Betty] Cool name.

259
00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.206
They're super cool
bad guys. no doubt.
but they are even cooler

260
00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.675
thanks to the amazing actors
who played them.

261
00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:44.044
[Foxx] I think the beauty
of these franchises

262
00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:47.881
is that the fact that
you have such talented actors.

263
00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:49.950
With all these guys.
you can't miss.

264
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.453
The Norman Osborn character
is sort of a tragic figure

265
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.723
and something
I could get behind.

266
00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.858
It was fun to play that role.

267
00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:00.694
You know. I'm something of
a scientist myself.

268
00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.564
Octavius knows what I can do.

269
00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.166
[Molina]
In a lesser environment.

270
00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:09.136
us as villains.
we would just be functionaries.

271
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.538
We would just be there to.
you know. get the plot going.

272
00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:15.642
But here.
we've got real story lines.
They are real people.

273
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.546
In the first film.
you had crazy-eyed Willem Dafoe
as the Green Goblin...

274
00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.581
[growls. shouts]

275
00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:24.417
...wearing that emerald
nightmare right over there.

276
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.820
I love that outfit.
I'll wear it to a nightclub.
Iconic.

277
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.889
[crowd screaming]
[growls]

278
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.557
[chuckles]
You want to know the truth?

279
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.461
Nobody knows how uncomfortable
those costumes are.

280
00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:39.432
[Smoove]
We had the amazing performance
from Alfred Molina as Doc Ock.

281
00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:43.103
It's been very nice to come back
to something that is familiar.

282
00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.938
but. at the same time.
completely new.

283
00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:46.373
Looks like we got competition.

284
00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.408
[Molina]
There's some real depth to it.

285
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:49.877
and that's what
makes them interesting.

286
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.911
[Peter 3]
I'm sorry
what was your name again?

287
00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.813
Dr. Otto Octavius.

288
00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.582
[laughing]
No.

289
00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.951
There's no way your name's
Dr. Otto Octavius.

290
00:11:58.786 --> 00:11:59.953
Wait. seriously?

291
00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:01.088
[Watts laughs] Cut.

292
00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:05.058
We met Venom
for the first time. Ooh.

293
00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:08.295
Thomas Haden Church
played a killer Sandman too.

294
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:10.964
looking like he came straight
out of the comic book.

295
00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.866
Or the beach. [chuckles]

296
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.103
We were treated to Rhys Ifans
as the Lizard.

297
00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.071
[roars]

298
00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:20.073
A quick cameo from Paul Giamatti
as the Rhino...

299
00:12:20.107 --> 00:12:22.275
[laughing]

300
00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:23.743
Jamie Fox as Electro.

301
00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.779
[Foxx] You got a lot of
great minds here. man.

302
00:12:25.813 --> 00:12:28.982
When you have
that type of dynamite.
that type of TNT.

303
00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:30.717
I mean. people are gonna
go along for the ride.

304
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.085
I think people
are gonna marvel--

305
00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:34.955
Oh!
Man!

306
00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.557
[Smoove]
And poor Dane DeHaan
literally fell apart

307
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.960
to become the new Green Goblin.

308
00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.095
[cackles]

309
00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:44.497
But how are you gonna top
Michael freaking Keaton
as Vulture?

310
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:45.732
Can't be done!

311
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.600
[Holland]
He was so intimidating.

312
00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.136
it required
no acting on my behalf

313
00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.938
because I'm just
meant to be terrified.

314
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:54.007
There is no one who could play
that role better than he could.

315
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.909
I thought this was
the antigravity gun.

316
00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.144
No. that's that one.

317
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.646
[Smoove chuckles]
Oh. come on.

318
00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.414
Jake Gyllenhaal
also totally nailed

319
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.317
his turn as Mysterio
in Far From Home.

320
00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.119
At first you're like.

321
00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:08.822
"Aw. What an amazing mentor
and friend he is."

322
00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:12.525
And the next thing you know.
he's ordering a drone strike
on you and your friends.

323
00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.627
-[shouting]
-Oh. It happened. I was there.

324
00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.663
Kill that witch!

325
00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:20.300
[Watts] I love the idea
of putting a bunch of
rogue villains together

326
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.970
and just watching them
meet each other and
hang out and talk.

327
00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:25.605
You know I can give you
a real makeover.

328
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.040
Let me guess. into a lizard?

329
00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.208
Exactly.

330
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.676
Would you two just shut up?

331
00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.444
I've never really seen that.

332
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:35.282
I don't think any of the actors
were coming for a cameo.

333
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:39.953
I think that they were all
coming to tell another chapter

334
00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.155
of their characters' story.

335
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:43.790
You want to play games?

336
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.959
You can't get better
than Alfred Molina as Doc Ock.

337
00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:49.496
If you were ever gonna bring
Doc Ock back. it would have
to be Alfred Molina.

338
00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:52.465
And we realized that.
thanks to the MCU.

339
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.001
there's a way to do that.

340
00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.635
And that's what
No Way Home is doing--

341
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.470
paying honor.
in a very direct way.

342
00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.639
to the Spidey films
that have come before.

343
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.741
I think I can say this
for all of us. we're all fans.

344
00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.011
And it's a wonderful world
to be in.

345
00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:06.213
And if I say so myself.
we're having a lot of fun.

346
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:07.247
[shouts]

347
00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:12.052
[Pascal] The wonderful thing
about working on these movies

348
00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:16.256
is that we have been working
with unparalleled actors.

349
00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:18.892
I mean. actors are everything.

350
00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:21.594
We live in an amazing time
in history. people.

351
00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.663
where we've
been gifted not one.

352
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:27.234
but two Mary Jane Watsons
in our lives.

353
00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.236
[Starr] The always charming
Kirsten Dunst

354
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.703
played her
in the initial trilogy.

355
00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:32.539
providing us with
a wonderful performance

356
00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:34.942
and perhaps one of
the most iconic screen kisses

357
00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:36.043
of all time.

358
00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:45.752
Yeah. man. I like
my movie kisses wet
and hanging upside down.

359
00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:47.554
[chuckles]
Okay.

360
00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:50.890
[Starr] Our costar Zendaya would
eventually take the MJ mantle

361
00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.392
in the most recent films.

362
00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.427
bringing a very funny.
more modern spin.

363
00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.964
I don't wanna
celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

364
00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:59.399
Oh. I'm sure
the Washington Monument
wasn't built by...

365
00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.635
Okay. Enjoy your book.

366
00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:04.972
[screams]

367
00:15:06.273 --> 00:15:08.475
Think I wanna be done now!

368
00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:11.311
-But we never got
to see the kiss again.
-Never. never doing that again.

369
00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:12.679
Well. I don't know
about that.

370
00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:19.953
[Smoove]
We also had two Gwen Stacys
make it into the films.

371
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:23.756
First. Bryce Dallas Howard
appeared in the role
in Spider-Man 3.

372
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.226
[Starr] But it was
the Emma Stone version
from The Amazing Spider-Man 2

373
00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.162
that met with the same fate
as her comic book counterpart.

374
00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:32.399
[Peter 2]
You can't be here right now.
This is insane!

375
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.135
Okay. guess what!
This is my choice.
This is mine.

376
00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:37.237
[Starr]
And what Spider-Man story
would be complete

377
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.106
without mentioning Aunt May?

378
00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.608
-What's going on in there?
-Peter's beloved mother figure.

379
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:44.077
[Smoove] First. we had
the great Rosemary Harris

380
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:47.014
playing a quintessential
white-haired version
of Aunt May.

381
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:49.649
Then they went out
and got Sally Field.

382
00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:52.019
-[Starr] A legend.
-[Smoove] Phew!

383
00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.820
Absolutely. a legend.

384
00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:56.089
And then in our films. we get
the incredible Marisa Tomei...

385
00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.790
[Starr] Oh. my--

386
00:15:57.824 --> 00:16:00.293
...who flipped my perception
of the character on its head.

387
00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:02.329
She really was
kind of like my aunt.

388
00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:05.365
And we have this kind
of familial connection
to each other.

389
00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.300
That was great.

390
00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.102
And no discussion
of Spider-Man's
supporting characters

391
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.271
would be complete
without talking about

392
00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.140
J.K. Simmons'
inspired performance

393
00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.607
as J. Jonah Jameson.

394
00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.476
editor-in-chief
of the Daily Bugle

395
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:19.346
and the ultimate
Spider-Man troll.

396
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:20.680
[Smoove] Spider-Man troll.

397
00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:23.116
I didn't try to
base him on anything

398
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.052
other than my take on
the comic books.

399
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.654
And then it was just
roll the camera and bark.

400
00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:29.856
Could you pay me
in advance?

401
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.326
[wheezing laugh]

402
00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.396
You serious?

403
00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:39.966
[Smoove]
J.K.'s performance was so damn
good in the original trilogy

404
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.369
that they didn't even bother
recasting the character

405
00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.671
when he shows up at the end
of Far From Home.

406
00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:48.208
'cause who wants to live
in that flattop's shadow?

407
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:49.709
There you have it. folks:

408
00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:52.479
Conclusive proof
that Spider-Man was responsible

409
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.747
for the brutal murder
of Mysterio.

410
00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:56.849
[Starr] What a great time
to be a Spider-Man fan.

411
00:16:56.883 --> 00:16:59.086
-That's right. folks.
-Whoo-whee!

412
00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.188
"Spider-Man: Hero or Menace"?

413
00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:03.723
[crew member] Three. two. one.

414
00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.024
Here we go.

415
00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.693
Behind every
successful superhero film

416
00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.195
is a great director.

417
00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.930
And each of these
Spider-Man film series

418
00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:14.534
have boasted a trio of
talented filmmakers at the helm.

419
00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.237
[Smoove] Director Sam Raimi
got first crack

420
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.840
at bringing everybody's
favorite wall crawler to life.

421
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.475
Ready. and action.

422
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.350
I love Sam Raimi.
As a young filmmaker. you're
seeing someone do something

423
00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.619
that is so entertaining
and so full of life

424
00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:34.354
and comedy and energy.

425
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.123
Then you feel like
you could do that too.

426
00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:38.125
-How'd you do that?
-Work out.

427
00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:40.227
You know.
eat your green vegetables.

428
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.862
He won me over with his vision.
like. instantly.

429
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.097
[horn honks]

430
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:45.465
[Pascal] Schools closed down

431
00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:47.267
so people could
go see that movie.

432
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.403
You know. nobody had ever seen
Spider-Man swinging before.

433
00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:52.205
[Maguire] Obviously.
there's a lot of humor.

434
00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:55.742
Sam loves to just
torture his characters.

435
00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:58.044
Cut it now. Good.

436
00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.312
That was good.

437
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.949
[Smoove]
And then came Marc Webb.

438
00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:05.485
Already a successful
music video director.

439
00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:08.988
Webb was handed the keys to
The Amazing Spider-Man series.

440
00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:12.425
I love those movies.
and I thought that Marc Webb

441
00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:15.662
had such great human talent.

442
00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:19.098
And then when
we cast Andrew and Emma.

443
00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:21.434
I think he did
a brilliant job with them.

444
00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.002
[claps]
Good.

445
00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.837
[Starr] Webb reimagined
his Spider-M story

446
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.639
from the ground up.

447
00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:29.142
surrounding Peter Parker with
an award-winning supporting cast

448
00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:30.843
and then thrilling audiences

449
00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:34.013
by putting them right in
the thick of the action.

450
00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:37.417
Marc is very. very generous.

451
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.520
and he's a really creative.
exciting director.

452
00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:42.155
[Webb] Action!

453
00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:44.257
Next. we arrive

454
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:48.094
-at our esteemed colleague.
Mr. Jon Watts.
-[Starr] Yep. yep.

455
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.430
[Smoove] Director of the three
most recent Spider-Man films.

456
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.765
Homecoming. Far From Home

457
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.668
and the third installment.
No Way Home. baby.

458
00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:57.870
[Feige] Seeing him grow
through Homecoming

459
00:18:57.904 --> 00:19:00.173
and then Far From Home.
and now with No Way Home.

460
00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:03.710
which is by far
the most ambitious
Spider-Man film ever made.

461
00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:06.546
seeing how he's grown into
that role is really amazing.

462
00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:09.282
[Holland] Jon Watts has done
such a wonderful job

463
00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:12.519
of creating this genre
of superhero movie

464
00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:14.787
that kind of
hasn't been told before.

465
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:17.824
-Jon is amazing.
-The weight of this film.
he carries it so lightly.

466
00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:18.858
Great. Cut.

467
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.893
Yeah!
[cheering]

468
00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:23.663
[Starr]
His ability to combine humor.
humanity and spectacular action

469
00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:26.733
has helped propel
the recent films
to all-new heights.

470
00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:29.001
Going up!

471
00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:31.471
It's not
like they are these little
stand-alone stories either.

472
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.841
They also have to honor
the bigger MCU story lines

473
00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.643
going on in the background too.

474
00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.212
I can't believe I'm
in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

475
00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:40.380
Neither can I.

476
00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:41.914
-Give me the box.
-No.

477
00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:44.150
[Holland]
Jon Watts. he has this thing

478
00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.419
where he'll say "one more"
for every take.

479
00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:48.087
and then you'll do
20 more takes.

480
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.522
-One more.
-One more.

481
00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:51.358
-One more.
-One. one. one. one more.

482
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.660
One more means one more
when you're on 22.

483
00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.728
Are you sure it's one more?

484
00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:58.431
Every time I say that now.
I'm gonna get in trouble.
Not in trouble.

485
00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:00.367
Put a dollar
in the "one more" jar?
Yeah.

486
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.634
Got it. Moving on.
Just kidding.

487
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.273
[horns honking]

488
00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:13.780
-Spidey has hops. I could
do that in my younger days.
-I believe you.

489
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:16.916
[Smoove] Each film series
has taken its own stab

490
00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.286
at adapting Spidey's
unique powers for film.

491
00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:22.689
resulting in some of
the craziest action and stunts

492
00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.391
you're ever gonna see.

493
00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:28.461
requiring the lead actors
to dive headlong into training.

494
00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:31.964
fight choreography
and lots and lots of wirework.

495
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.401
In the original trilogy.

496
00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:38.305
the VFX team blended
large-scale practical effects

497
00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:40.807
with state-of-the-art
digital effects from the time

498
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.075
to give audiences
their first glimpse

499
00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:45.912
at web swinging
on the big screen.

500
00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:47.847
It also holds up too.

501
00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:50.550
And nowhere is that
more apparent

502
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:54.253
than in the absurdly cool
subway scene from Spider-Man 2.

503
00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:03.896
You know. back in my day.

504
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.932
I had to do
a lot more practically.

505
00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:08.901
And it's just a lot easier now

506
00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.471
with what
technology's able to do.

507
00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:14.741
[crew member]
Three. two. one. action!

508
00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.977
[Smoove] Ten years later.
digital effects had advanced
to the point

509
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.147
where Marc Webb and his VFX team

510
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.751
were able to drop you
right into Spider-Man's POV

511
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.018
in The Amazing Spider-Man

512
00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:28.287
for an even more
immersive thrill ride

513
00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:29.689
through the streets
of Manhattan.

514
00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:31.157
All right. Good. And cut.

515
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.826
[Webb] I thought about
the nature of Spider-Man

516
00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.963
and how important it was
for us to reinvent

517
00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:39.198
the language of Spider-Man.

518
00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.601
[Peter 2] What have you got
for me today. New York?

519
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.636
[Smoove] But then.
Homecoming gave us

520
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.772
-that incredible
ferry disaster sequence...
-[loud grunting]

521
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.476
...which gets one-upped
by Spidey's epic midair battle
with the Vulture

522
00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:52.011
on the surface
of a stealth plane.

523
00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.179
Absolutely incredible.

524
00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:54.313
Safety first.

525
00:21:54.347 --> 00:21:55.848
[Smoove] Then in Far From Home.

526
00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:58.184
we get treated to
these massive Elemental battles.

527
00:21:58.217 --> 00:22:01.053
but they turn out to be
just an appetizer.

528
00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:02.088
[chuckling]

529
00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:07.226
And what about that
sick Mysterio illusion sequence

530
00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:10.830
where he brings
all of Peter Parker's
inner fears to life?

531
00:22:10.863 --> 00:22:13.366
Zombie Tony Stark
about to eat his brain!

532
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.069
And then wham!
He gets taken out by the Eurail.

533
00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:19.238
You hated to see it.
but it had to happen.

534
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:22.642
It blew my mind and made me
question reality myself.

535
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:24.343
This is Peter Parker.
this is Peter Parker.

536
00:22:24.377 --> 00:22:25.645
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

537
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:26.846
They're mes
from other universes.

538
00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:28.214
No. no.
They're here to help.

539
00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:30.349
This is the wizard
I was telling you about.

540
00:22:30.383 --> 00:22:32.485
[Holland] From
a choreography standpoint.
it's interesting

541
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:35.187
because Spider-Man's never
fought with Spider-Man before.

542
00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:37.056
And I think what
we want to try and explore

543
00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.426
is an element of us trying
to figure each other out

544
00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:42.094
and figure out our each
individual. unique styles

545
00:22:42.128 --> 00:22:43.763
of how to be Spider-Man.

546
00:22:43.796 --> 00:22:45.765
And the amazing thing about
working with Marvel and Sony

547
00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:48.234
is that the sky's the limit
with these films.

548
00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:50.102
There's no idea
that's too crazy.

549
00:22:50.136 --> 00:22:53.039
so if you want to do
a quadruple backflip

550
00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:55.542
over an electric zap
or something.

551
00:22:55.575 --> 00:22:57.043
that can happen.

552
00:22:57.076 --> 00:22:59.345
So. it's so fun
being able to just sit down.

553
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.913
play with the stunt team

554
00:23:00.947 --> 00:23:02.782
and figure out how
we're going to make this film

555
00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:04.951
bigger and better
than anything before.

556
00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.088
No. I really think
you should have a disguise.

557
00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:12.124
An effective one.
but also one that's funny.

558
00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:18.565
[Feige] The Spider-Man
costume is probably.
with no exaggeration.

559
00:23:18.598 --> 00:23:21.200
one of the best
graphic design elements

560
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.302
in the history
of graphic design.

561
00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.071
[Peter 2]
So. are you gonna
go into battle

562
00:23:25.104 --> 00:23:26.573
dressed as
a cool youth pastor.

563
00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:28.174
or do you got
your suit?

564
00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:32.244
[Garfield] We were talking about
the idea of how cool it is

565
00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:33.980
to wear the Spider-Man suit.

566
00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:37.083
But in reality.
it takes three people
and five shoehorns

567
00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:40.620
and a lot of talcum powder
and oil and. like. 45 minutes--

568
00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:42.088
Are you still
using talcum powder?

569
00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:44.290
I'm still on the talc.
The secret is...

570
00:23:44.323 --> 00:23:46.793
[Maguire] Go on.
[Holland] I'll tell you
the secret later.

571
00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:48.495
[Garfield] We'll catch up.
I figured it out.

572
00:23:48.528 --> 00:23:51.397
Can I just go back to the trick
about putting on the suit?

573
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.833
'Cause this is practical stuff
that I want to know.

574
00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:56.936
So. we have these plastic bags
that I put over my feet.

575
00:23:56.969 --> 00:23:58.337
Ah. slippery.

576
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.806
And then they
slide right in.
Slide in.

577
00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:02.675
The only thing is.
you get mad sweaty feet.

578
00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:03.876
Tell me more about that.

579
00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:11.017
The Spidey suits
you see in the movies
are significantly better

580
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.953
than the footy pajama versions
I like to wear.

581
00:24:13.986 --> 00:24:16.489
Or-Or-Or I used to wear.

582
00:24:16.523 --> 00:24:19.091
Anyway.
we thought it would be fun
to take a look back

583
00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.860
at all the different
Spider-Man suits

584
00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:22.361
that have graced the big screen.

585
00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:23.863
[sighs]

586
00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.598
Man. it's crazy!

587
00:24:25.632 --> 00:24:27.500
What else can this suit do?

588
00:24:28.568 --> 00:24:30.069
[gasps] What?

589
00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:35.207
[Smoove] First though.
we got Tobey Maguire's
red hoodie number

590
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.109
from the original
Spider-Man film.

591
00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:39.178
-You got my name wrong--
-[announcer] Get out there.
you moron!

592
00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:42.114
Looks kind of like Banksy
if he shopped at Marshalls.

593
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:44.350
[Tobey] Spidey's gotta
adjust his glasses.

594
00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:47.153
[Smoove] Tobey then
gets an upgrade with
an iconic red-and-blue suit

595
00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:49.989
that will last
the entire first trilogy.

596
00:24:50.022 --> 00:24:53.025
Although it barely made it
through an entire movie
in one piece.

597
00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:57.129
[chuckles]
And no need for web shooters
cluttering up that drip.

598
00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:59.532
My man Tobey had
organic web shooters.

599
00:24:59.566 --> 00:25:02.501
which is kinda nasty
when you think about it.

600
00:25:02.535 --> 00:25:04.971
[students laughing]

601
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:06.839
But it's also super cool.

602
00:25:06.873 --> 00:25:08.675
It's kind of like having
a runny nose in your wrist.

603
00:25:11.177 --> 00:25:13.145
Later. in Spider-Man 3.

604
00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:15.381
-you got a taste of
the legendary black suit...
-[gasps]

605
00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:16.883
-...from the comic books.
-Wow.

606
00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:18.651
[Smoove]
For formal occasions. of course.

607
00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:20.920
Sometimes he might throw
a bow tie on it. I don't know.

608
00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:23.590
Then came
The Amazing Spider-Man.
which debuted a new suit look

609
00:25:23.623 --> 00:25:26.025
with a more serious tone.

610
00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:28.527
This is the costume.
This is the outfit.
[laughing]

611
00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:30.529
It's different. I mean.
we're changing things up.

612
00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:32.932
[Smoove]
Subdued colors. buggier eyes

613
00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:37.570
and Spider-Man's traditional
mechanical web shooters
on the wrists.

614
00:25:37.604 --> 00:25:40.206
A second suit dropped
in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

615
00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:42.508
brightening the colors.
widening the eyes

616
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:46.012
and adopting more of Spidey's
classic comic book look.

617
00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:48.347
Those eyes. which are big.
they're really--

618
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.384
Those big. expressive.
kind. friendly. white eyes

619
00:25:52.418 --> 00:25:53.853
that are such an important part

620
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:55.755
of how people interact
with Spider-Man

621
00:25:55.788 --> 00:25:57.757
and why they love Spider-Man.

622
00:25:59.125 --> 00:26:00.627
[Peter 3] A minor upgrade?

623
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.797
Whoa! Oh. my God!

624
00:26:04.831 --> 00:26:06.599
Put it on.

625
00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:08.367
[Smoove] Tom Holland's
first suit was introduced

626
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.137
when the character debuted
in Captain America: Civil War.

627
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.874
It was a sleek. modern nod
to the classic Spidey look.

628
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:16.442
Plus. it came with web shooters

629
00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:20.446
and also enhanced with
all kinds of crazy Stark tech.

630
00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:21.948
In Homecoming.

631
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:25.117
Tom also dons his nifty
homemade prototype suit.

632
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:26.919
[Happy] What the hell
are you wearing?

633
00:26:26.953 --> 00:26:28.320
[Smoove] Then we get to Tom's
tricked-out Iron Spider look

634
00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:30.122
in Infinity Wa and Endgame.

635
00:26:30.156 --> 00:26:32.224
with those shiny.
golden spider legs

636
00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:34.493
flying every which way.

637
00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:37.797
After that.
Far From Home introduced
another all-black outfit.

638
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.666
aka the Night Monkey.

639
00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:41.433
-Whoo!
-[Fury] How's the suit?

640
00:26:41.467 --> 00:26:43.135
It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

641
00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:44.737
Parker!
Okay. I'll shut up.

642
00:26:44.771 --> 00:26:46.639
Later in the film. Peter designs

643
00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.474
an all-new suit
with Stark tech...

644
00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:49.942
[sighs] Okay.

645
00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:52.511
[Smoove] ...resulting
in the first-of-its-kind

646
00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:54.346
red-and-black variation.

647
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.817
With all these suits.
I can't wait to see what's next.

648
00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.219
You think your fancy
new suit's gonna save you?

649
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.258
[Stan Lee] The thing
I'm proudest of is the fact

650
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:11.130
that people of all ages
seem to love Spider-Man.

651
00:27:11.163 --> 00:27:14.133
[Starr] Take a quick look back
at all of Stan's cameos

652
00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:16.502
from all the Spider-Man films.

653
00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:19.706
Stan Lee.
Gone. but never forgotten.

654
00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:21.007
Excelsior.

655
00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:28.347
[screams]
Look out!

656
00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:32.685
-[grunts]
-Hey! Shut that off!

657
00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:34.286
I was--
Tell him it's my car!

658
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.123
Don't make me
come down there. you punk!

659
00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:39.959
Hey. Gary! How ya doing?

660
00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:41.327
Marjorie. how are you?

661
00:27:45.832 --> 00:27:47.767
[crowd applauding]

662
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.538
Hey. I think
I know that guy.

663
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:59.712
You know. I guess one person
can make a difference.

664
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:03.049
Nuff said.

665
00:28:04.283 --> 00:28:07.319
Doing this show. Martin.
one thing becomes pretty clear.

666
00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:08.420
What's that?

667
00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:09.856
When it comes
to superheroes.

668
00:28:09.889 --> 00:28:11.991
Spider-Man is king.
Okay.

669
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:13.826
[Starr]
We've got three versions.
eight films.

670
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.427
countless box office records.

671
00:28:15.461 --> 00:28:16.863
The fact that this one character

672
00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:18.931
is capable of that much
success for so long

673
00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:20.532
is a testament to the appeal

674
00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:22.134
of Stan Lee
and Steve Ditko's creation.

675
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.072
[Smoove]
But we ain't done. Martin.
We're not?

676
00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:28.741
No. Even though every
Spider-Man film series

677
00:28:28.775 --> 00:28:31.210
has taken the character
down a different road.

678
00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:34.346
now all these roads
lead to one place.

679
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.215
-[Starr] Hmm. Where's that?
-Spider-Man: No Way Home.

680
00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:39.952
The culmination
of two decades worth
of hard work. creativity

681
00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:42.621
and some intense gymnastics.

682
00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.857
Dude!
[Ned] Dude!

683
00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:46.192
Dude!

684
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:47.393
[gasps]

685
00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:49.461
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

686
00:28:49.495 --> 00:28:52.899
I don't know about you. man.
but my juices are flowing.

687
00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:54.433
[Starr]
Yeah. right there
with you. buddy.

688
00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.068
We hope that you enjoyed

689
00:28:56.102 --> 00:28:58.570
this trip down Spider-Man
movie memory lane

690
00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:00.739
as much as we enjoyed
putting this thing together

691
00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:02.909
with the help of some
very talented people.

692
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.645
[Smoove] It's all effort
and personal sacrifice.

693
00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:09.415
With great power
comes great responsibility.

694
00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:11.317
[Smoove]
You're now locked and loaded

695
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.319
for Spider-Man: No Way Home.

696
00:29:13.352 --> 00:29:15.721
You can thank us later.
You're welcome.

697
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:18.457
Do it for yourself.
but also do it for us.

698
00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.427
after all we've been through
this last half an hour.

699
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.131
Plus. Daddy's STARmeter
needs some boost.

700
00:29:25.164 --> 00:29:27.633
Spidey fans. look the guy up.

701
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.936
He's J.B. Smoove.

702
00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:31.503
And this guy here
is Martin Starr.

703
00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:32.604
Thanks for watching.

704
00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:35.141
[imitating shooting web]

705
00:29:35.174 --> 00:29:37.209
What are you spraying?
What are you doing?

706
00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:41.881
We lost him.
