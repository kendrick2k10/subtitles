00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.090
I once saw some video about
some Reggaes on some island.

180
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.243
and their dreadlocks somehow define 'em.

181
00:09:22.323 --> 00:09:25.380
I don't know. I ain't ever losing my hair.

182
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.508
- Yep. You're a regular
fuckin' Bob Marley.

183
00:09:29.508 --> 00:09:30.341
- Thanks.

184
00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:35.326
(bicycle clicking)

185
00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:39.946
(mailbox clatters)

186
00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:43.113

187
00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:56.952

(Mom signs lightly)

193
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:24.237
Hey. Mama. Got your moon pies.

194
00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:27.154
(wrapper crinkles)

195
00:10:29.493 --> 00:10:30.576
There you go.

196
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.680
(soft TV chatter in background)

197
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.023
They gonna raise the medicine price again.

198
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.100
Them people's lower than a
snake's belly in a waggon rut.

199
00:10:51.387 --> 00:10:52.220
Open up.

200
00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:00.423
Now don't you worry at all.

201
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.119
I'll find a way.

202
00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:11.536
(soft melancholic music)

203
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.297
(gentle music)

204
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.623
Ain't no one nowhere
hiring no one nowhere.

205
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.093
Hi. Ron.

206
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.560
Someone once told me
that things'll get worse

207
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.253
before they get better.

208
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.613
But for me. life was
amountin' to a hill of beans.

209
00:11:49.072 --> 00:11:51.572
(birds chirp)

210
00:11:56.496 --> 00:11:57.720
(heavy swish)
(car engine rumbles)

211
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.190
But. just then. outta nowhere.

212
00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:05.024

(Baron breathes heavily)

243
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.110
- We got a walking trail where
you can hear the armadillos

244
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.943
crying at night.

245
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.980
Got an abandoned quarry
that don't feel like

246
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.660
it have no bottom.

247
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.993
Folks in small homes with
big dreams and no means.

248
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.140
We got a post office run
by a mean ole boss lady

249
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.050
with a hatred of long hairs
for no reason in particular.

250
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.410
One red light. one ice cream
shop. lots of friendly folks.

251
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.850
So friendly. we don't have no police.

252
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.497
no fire department. no nothing.

253
00:14:07.497 --> 00:14:12.060
Uh. I don't know where you come
from. but we don't got much.

254
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.693
I ain't got nothing. but it's home.

255
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.173
And it's the only place I ever knowed.

256
00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:26.009
(Marmalade scoffs lightly)

257
00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:26.842
- Wow.

258
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.633
So you gonna show me around. or what?

259
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.363
Marmalade.

260
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.677
That's my name. it's Marmalade.

261
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.402
- That sounds like a name
and jelly rolled up in one.

262
00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:47.937
- I heard that before.

263
00:14:47.937 --> 00:14:48.813
- I'm Baron.

264
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.180

265
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.080

You okay?

- Mm-hmm.

272
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.460
- You just feel like staring at me

273
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.230
for an extremely awkward amount of time?

274
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.195
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

00:15:10.195 --> 00:15:11.028

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:48.363
(chuckles) So yeah. I
fuckin' bailed. again.

303
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.323
Jumped freight for a minute. and then uh.

304
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.410
then I met this sleaze bag out in Bug Bay.

305
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.180
but he gave me Big Bertha.

306
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.727
That's what I call her.
(hand pounds) Big B.

307
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:00.769
- He just gave it to you?

308
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:01.602
- Yep.

309
00:17:02.748 --> 00:17:03.581
- Hm.

310
00:17:03.581 --> 00:17:04.781
- He just gave it to me.

311
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.286
Who knows where I'll turn up next. right?

312
00:17:07.286 --> 00:17:11.190
(knife clicks)
(Marmalade laughs)

313
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.010
- Yeah. I couldn't just
up and leave my mama.

314
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.260
- Wasn't my real mom. no.

315
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.032
That lady's a whole other recipe.

316
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:24.829
I've been in foster homes since
(sputters). fuckin' forever.

317
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.850
- I don't tell no people this.

318
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.353
but my daddy was an astronaut.

319
00:17:32.356 --> 00:17:34.440
(Marmalade chuckles)

320
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.273
- Bullshit.

321
00:17:35.273 --> 00:17:36.270
- That's what my mama said.

322
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.350
And he could never come meet me

323
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.360
'cause he was too busy building a rocket.

324
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.683
But. it blew up with him. in space.

325
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.653
- Wow. (gasps)

326
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.360
- Yeah. if not for my mama.

327
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.220
I'd been long gone here come tomorrow.

328
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.120
- What's her name?

329
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.894
- Her name's Eda. Mama Eda.

330
00:18:02.894 --> 00:18:05.670
- Mama Eda. I like it.

331
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.500
- She's very sick.

332
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.272
They done raised the price
of her medicine overnight.

333
00:18:10.272 --> 00:18:11.105
- Mm.

334
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.980
- Yeah. can't no one afford it.

335
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.140
except some greedy man out there.

336
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.864
And. and he's so. he's so rich.

337
00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:21.720
He. he. he just buys another boat

338
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.133
when his first one get wet.

339
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.260
- You know what I say. hm?

340
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.633
I say when the system fails you.

341
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.270
you just gotta create
your own damn system.

342
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.003
They'll get what they're due.
Don't you worry about that.

343
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.520
They'll get what they're due.

344
00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:49.839
(gentle sombre music)

345
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.770
All right. Baron. I got
two questions for you.

346
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.880
You can just go ahead and tell me

347
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.943
if I'm being too forward or whatnot. okay?

348
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.473
Question one. (clears throat)

349
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.200
Got a place I can stay tonight?

350
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.203
- Yeah.

351
00:19:15.203 --> 00:19:17.163
- (laughs) Hot damn.

352
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.600
(Marmalade laughs)

353
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.934
- What's the other question?

354
00:19:22.934 --> 00:19:23.767
- Oh. I didn't have another question.

355
00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:26.040
That was just sort of like a backup.

356
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.357

Hi. Mama.

409
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.030

- I can't smell.

418
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.920

419
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.710
- No. I mean like. I can't smell nothing.

Never could. congenital anosmia.

00:28:17.327 --> 00:28:18.600
- Okay.
- You shoot the camera.

536
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.530
and then we out.

537
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.150
Wham bam. thank you ma'am.

538
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.243
- [Baron] Shoot? Shoot. shoot
the camera with. with what?

539
00:28:25.285 --> 00:28:26.699
(gun thuds)

540
00:28:26.699 --> 00:28:27.532
Uh.

541
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.183
- Number three. weapons training.

542
00:28:31.469 --> 00:28:33.842
(cans and bottles clink)

543
00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:36.642
(Marmalade imitates gun firing)

544
00:28:36.642 --> 00:28:37.812
(Marmalade laughs)

545
00:28:37.812 --> 00:28:40.230
Bam.

546
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.490
Can we focus now. please?

547
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.323
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

548
00:28:42.323 --> 00:28:44.340
I just ain't never used
no type of firearm before.

549
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.540
- What do I look like.
some fucking gun nut?

550
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.213
Hey. don't answer that.

551
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.903
Just aim. when you think
you're lined up. boom. fire.

552
00:28:59.882 --> 00:29:00.715
- Okay.

553
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.312
- Here you go. Bear right there.

554
00:29:04.312 --> 00:29:09.312
(gunshot blasts)
(Marmalade laughs)

555
00:29:13.432 --> 00:29:17.415
(gunshots blast)
(glass shatters)

556
00:29:17.415 --> 00:29:22.415
(Marmalade laughs and
screeches indistinctly)

557
00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:23.896
(Baron cries out)

558
00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:26.550
Number four. team bonding.

559
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.900
- Y'all need help?

560
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.783
- Yep. Where're your
changing rooms at. sugar.

561
00:29:31.635 --> 00:29:34.968
(slow blues rock music)

562
00:29:42.315 --> 00:29:46.482
(slow blues rock music continues)

563
00:29:59.503 --> 00:30:02.729
(lamp clatters)

564
00:30:02.729 --> 00:30:05.646
(Marmalade moans)

565
00:30:08.477 --> 00:30:12.240
- I love you. and I always will. (moans)

566
00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:21.337
- Yo! Shit. I got it. Damn.

567
00:30:21.337 --> 00:30:23.430
I'm trying to be down with
your details and shit. blood.

568
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.893
But like. you making
this hella uncomfortable.

569
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.080
Hand me that poop paper.

570
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.900
- Well anyway. Marmalade had tattoos

571
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.420
on all sorts of nooks and crannies.

572
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.850
Places I ain't ever
seen before. (chuckles)

573
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.070
She used to call me her blank canvas.

574
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.903
- Keep talking.

575
00:30:41.903 --> 00:30:44.662
- Well. then. Marmalade
got a heart tattoo.

576
00:30:44.662 --> 00:30:45.990
- [Marmalade] (laughs) I love
it. I love it. I love it.

577
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.790
- [Baron] With the name Baron on it.

578
00:30:49.015 --> 00:30:50.756
But. for mine--

579
00:30:50.756 --> 00:30:55.260
- No. No. no. no. you
fucking idiot. It's M-A-R-M.

580
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.080
- That idiot done spelled Marmalade wrong.

581
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.300
so we had him stop.

582
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.340
Just in the nick of time too.

583
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.250
He had an M and an A and an M.

584
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.830
All he had to do is add a little extra A.

585
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.900
Forever I'll have it
to think about my mama.

586
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.733
It's perfect.

587
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.600
- Hey. Marmalade got a lotta ink?

588
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.893
- Bunch of little ones.

589
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.453
Man. she does have this
puzzle piece on her neck.

590
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.150
- Puzzle piece?

591
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.700
All right. what's up with that?

592
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.360
- Well that's like. like a. like a piece

593
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.790
that you find when you're
looking for a puzzle.

594
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.530
And there's all these individuals--

595
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.140
- I know what the fuck puzzle
piece is. I got a granddaddy.

596
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.350
I was just. I'm saying like. is it like.

It's big?

599
00:31:42.503 --> 00:31:43.336
- Yeah. Why?

600
00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:46.320
- Why? You the one said
it's all about the details.

601
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.420
Got me over here feeling shit.
You know what I'm saying?

602
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.660
I'm inspired. motherfucker.
Quench my thirst.

603
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.493
Come on. blood.

604
00:31:53.446 --> 00:31:56.863
(gentle seductive music)

605
00:31:59.056 --> 00:32:00.987
(Gary clears throat)

606
00:32:00.987 --> 00:32:03.780
(Marmalade giggles)

607
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.613
- Oh. excuse me.

608
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.853
What's this? I gave you a 20.

609
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.360
- Uh. don't think so.
doll. Y'all gave me a 10.

610
00:32:15.168 --> 00:32:17.010
- Puppet. didn't I give him a 20?

611
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.893
- Marmalade had her own set
of rules for everything.

612
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.220
- Yeah. Gary. that was a 20.

613
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.693
Sorry. I. I done seen that.

614
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.730
- Skipped my third cup of
jitter juice this morning.

615
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.563
- [Baron] Oh.

616
00:32:30.563 --> 00:32:31.590
- [Gary] Sorry about that. Baron.

617
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.593
- It's all right.

618
00:32:32.593 --> 00:32:34.440
(cash register keys beep)

619
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.273
Thank you.

620
00:32:37.697 --> 00:32:38.530
(coins jingle)

621
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.600
Ready. puppet?
- Yep.

622
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.220

623
00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.813
- Send my best to Eda now. boy.

624
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:44.933
- Mama.

625
00:32:46.702 --> 00:32:50.403
(moon pie wrapper crumples)

626
00:32:50.403 --> 00:32:52.095
(car door bangs shut)

627
00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.833
(slow sombre music)

628
00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:58.533
I'm sorry. Mama. It's

629
00:32:59.847 --> 00:33:03.240
Uh. yeah. you know.

630
00:33:06.062 --> 00:33:09.693
We've been working on some big plans. yep.

631
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.643
Yeah. she done figured a way out.

632
00:33:12.643 --> 00:33:14.657
(Eda groans softly)

633
00:33:14.657 --> 00:33:16.653
(sighs) Yeah. truth be told.

634
00:33:18.243 --> 00:33:20.003
I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

635
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.890
Well she wants to. uh. she
wants to rob a dang bank.

636
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.220
(Eda groans softly)

637
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.053
I know.

638
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.843
And you know. I just.

639
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.693
she wants to.

640
00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.300
think I love her.

641
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.790
And you see. I don't wanna let her down.

642
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.083
It's just. I am scared. Mama.

643
00:33:51.216 --> 00:33:52.049
Mama.

644
00:33:57.937 --> 00:33:58.770
Mama?

645
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.443
Mama?

646
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.331
(Eda gasps and coughs violently)

647
00:34:10.331 --> 00:34:11.895
It's all right.

648
00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:13.228
It's okay. Okay.

649
00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:17.594
(Eda gasps and coughs)

650
00:34:22.282 --> 00:34:25.032
All right. don't you worry. Mama.

651
00:34:28.373 --> 00:34:30.023
We're gonna make this work. okay?

652
00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.110
I promise.

653
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.346
(Eda cries softly)

654
00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:36.179
I promise.

655
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.577
(gentle sombre music)

656
00:34:48.837 --> 00:34:52.837
(gentle sombre music continues)

657
00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:03.359
(gentle sombre music continues)

658
00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:12.706
(gentle sombre music continues)

659
00:35:19.986 --> 00:35:23.986
(gentle sombre music continues)

660
00:35:28.312 --> 00:35:30.521
(birds chirp)

661
00:35:30.521 --> 00:35:33.688
(Baron moans lightly)

662
00:35:34.843 --> 00:35:37.760
(soft scary music)

663
00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:44.427
(Baron gasps)
(Marmalade laughs)

664
00:35:44.427 --> 00:35:47.193
- Oh my god. You almost shit yourself.

665
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.890
Wait. did you actually shit yourself?

666
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.273
- Oh. why'd you do that?

667
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.190
- Early worm catches the bird.

668
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.563
You gotta plan. plan. plan.
plan. plan. plan. plan. Come on.

669
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.914
- Hey. you seen Mama's pills?

670
00:35:57.914 --> 00:35:59.160
(car engine races)

671
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.310
Hey. what happened to your
mama? Your birth mama?

672
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.280
You said. you said you
were in fosters care.

673
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.045
- It's foster care. not fosters.

674
00:36:08.045 --> 00:36:09.960
- [Baron] Oh. foster care.

675
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.293
Okay so. what happened. Marmalade?

676
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.290
- Number five. safe house.

677
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.760
Just quit asking me about it. all right?

678
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.260
- Why can't you just tell me?

679
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.550
- It. it was nothing. all right?

680
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.513
My momma just didn't come save me is all.

681
00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.323
Fuckin' fried outta her damn skull.

682
00:36:24.323 --> 00:36:25.240
- Save you?

683
00:36:27.141 --> 00:36:29.223
What you mean. "Save you?"

684
00:36:29.223 --> 00:36:30.181
Marmalade.

685
00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:31.973
- From one of my fuckin'
foster dads. okay?

686
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.703
Happy?

687
00:36:37.176 --> 00:36:39.513
(glass shatters)

688
00:36:39.513 --> 00:36:40.383
- What'd he do?

689
00:36:40.383 --> 00:36:44.367
- (sighs heavily) You don't wanna know.

690
00:36:44.367 --> 00:36:46.073
- [Baron] I do wanna know. I. I--

691
00:36:46.073 --> 00:36:47.573
- [Marmalade] I don't wanna talk about it.

692
00:36:47.573 --> 00:36:48.533
- [Baron] Why not?

693
00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:49.657
- [Marmalade] 'Cause I just
don't wanna talk about it.

694
00:36:49.657 --> 00:36:50.630
- [Baron] Why not?

695
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:51.920
- Fuck!

696
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.913
(car engine revs)

697
00:36:52.913 --> 00:36:55.530
My life ain't like yours. all right.

698
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.463
You don't wanna know what
the fuck I've been through.

699
00:36:56.463 --> 00:36:58.410
- I wanna know. I do.
- No you don't.

700
00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:59.535
- Yes.
- You really don't.

701
00:36:59.535 --> 00:37:00.535
- Like what?

702
00:37:01.755 --> 00:37:04.672
(soft tense music)

703
00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:18.568
- Like...

704
00:37:20.156 --> 00:37:23.323
(soft haunting music)

705
00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:28.276
(Marmalade sniffles)

706
00:37:28.276 --> 00:37:33.276
Like someone who hobbles into
your fuckin' room every night.

707
00:37:36.778 --> 00:37:40.195
We were (clears throat).

708
00:37:42.169 --> 00:37:44.885
we were just little kids. you know.

709
00:37:44.885 --> 00:37:48.052
(soft haunting music)

710
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.983
We were just little kids.

711
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.490
And after he done with all that.

712
00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.956
he takes you out to the fuckin' garage

713
00:37:59.956 --> 00:38:02.539
and he locks you in a dog cage.

714
00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:09.049
Fuckin' dog cages. (cries)

715
00:38:10.437 --> 00:38:14.733
And he jabs at you with his
stupid little white cane.

716
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.670
His left eye twitching.
when you get him mad.

717
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.010
I should've took his cane
and killed that fat fuck

718
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.243
when I had the chance.

719
00:38:25.404 --> 00:38:28.321
(soft tense music)

720
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.680
And hell. I heard he
still fosters little kids.

721
00:38:41.258 --> 00:38:42.480
(Marmalade sniffles)

722
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.610
Probably still got cages
out in the back garage.

723
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.510
You don't wanna know about this stuff.

724
00:38:49.836 --> 00:38:50.669
Oh.

725
00:38:55.717 --> 00:38:59.493
- Well. I'm your knight in
shining armour. Remember that?

726
00:39:02.483 --> 00:39:04.170
(Marmalade laughs)

727
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.298
Remember that?

728
00:39:05.298 --> 00:39:06.881
- Yeah. I do. I do.

729
00:39:09.607 --> 00:39:12.793
Mm. yeah. that's right. (laughs)

730
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.290
But for right now. it's
time we make our own rules.

731
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.695
- Yeah.
- Hm?

732
00:39:20.695 --> 00:39:23.695
(Marmalade giggles)

733
00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:26.430
(both moan)

734
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.263
All right.

735
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.203
- Love you too.

736
00:39:32.491 --> 00:39:33.900
- You comin'?

737
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.153
- Yeah. Oh. geez.

738
00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:37.866
(door slams shut)

739
00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:40.353
- [Marmalade] Number six. disguises.

740
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.328
- [Baron] Marmalade?

741
00:39:43.328 --> 00:39:45.060
(Marmalade laughs)

742
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.940
- So we gotta think about
our disguises a tonne

743
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.700
because with our notoriety.
we'll be known forever

744
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.040
by whatever bullshit
name they come up with.

745
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.960
- That. who's they?

746
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.250
- You just gotta make a statement

747
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:00.163
but not be too fuckin' stupid. (laughs)

748
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.686
- Uh. what about this?

749
00:40:03.686 --> 00:40:07.080
We could be the uh. we
could be the rooster gang.

750
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.240
something like that.
- Mm.

751
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.680
Nah. they'd probably just call us

752
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.060
the giant fucking cock gang.

753
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.760
I bet you'd like that though. huh?

754
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.260
(Marmalade gasps)

755
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.300
Puppet looky. Looky. looky. looky. looky.

756
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.150
Help me. help me.

757
00:40:21.546 --> 00:40:22.379
Oh. Here.

758
00:40:23.563 --> 00:40:25.070
- Oh. it's...

759
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.103
- What's better than one Marmalade?

760
00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:33.206
Three Marmalades.

761
00:40:33.206 --> 00:40:36.123
(soft eerie music)

762
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.053
- I. I don't think we can afford these.

763
00:40:41.116 --> 00:40:44.283
(soft haunting music)

764
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.103
- Put it on.

765
00:40:48.253 --> 00:40:51.506
Come on. put it on. Try it on.

766
00:40:51.506 --> 00:40:56.333
Oh.

767
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:59.707
(Marmalade chuckles)

768
00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:01.650
You know. you and me.
we've been kicked around

769
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.603
our whole lives.

770
00:41:04.537 --> 00:41:07.042
It's time we start kicking back.

771
00:41:07.042 --> 00:41:10.209
(intense eerie music)

772
00:41:24.713 --> 00:41:26.612
(clerk gasps)

773
00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:28.112
Get on the ground.

774
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:31.178
Come on. get on the ground.

775
00:41:31.178 --> 00:41:33.263
Get on the fucking ground!

776
00:41:33.263 --> 00:41:35.039
(gun whacks)

777
00:41:35.039 --> 00:41:37.439
(Marmalade gasps)

778
00:41:37.439 --> 00:41:39.359
(cash register beeps)

779
00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:41.775
(tense scary music)

780
00:41:41.775 --> 00:41:45.757
Fuck. Let's split. Puppet.
Let's go. Fuckin' split.

781
00:41:45.757 --> 00:41:47.319
Let's go. split.

782
00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:50.319
(tense eerie music)

783
00:41:59.286 --> 00:42:04.244
(car engine revs)
(tyres squeal)

784
00:42:04.244 --> 00:42:07.744
(tense adventurous music)

785
00:42:14.764 --> 00:42:17.347
(tyres squeal)

786
00:42:18.371 --> 00:42:21.621
(birds chirp)

787
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:22.454
(Baron breathes heavily)

788
00:42:22.454 --> 00:42:23.287
Hey?

789
00:42:25.313 --> 00:42:27.880
Hey. baby. I was just playing.

790
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.073
Look at me. It's just me.

791
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.110
That kid just got a little boo-boo. okay?

792
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.193
Stupid little dummy.

793
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.443
Just being stupid funny to get
the jitters out for tomorrow.

794
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:45.743
- Tomorrow?

795
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:47.843
- D-Day?

796
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.000
- I. I. I think I got some
baseball card collection

797
00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:54.923
we could sell. we can't--

798
00:42:54.923 --> 00:42:56.502
- She's gonna fuckin' die. Baron.

799
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.443
She's gonna fuckin' die.

800
00:43:00.443 --> 00:43:01.276
- Don't say that.

801
00:43:03.224 --> 00:43:04.057
- Look.

802
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.187
this will be our last job.

803
00:43:08.187 --> 00:43:09.633
(smacks lips) I swear.

804
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.866
- We haven't even had our first job yet.

805
00:43:12.866 --> 00:43:16.950
- (giggles) Just gotta go tomorrow. okay?

806
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.310
Some things you just gotta trust me on.

807
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.977
(insects chirp)

808
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.963
Number seven. bank note.

809
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:33.830
Masks. put on our faces.
Notes. hide our voices.

810
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.750
- But you done spelled money wrong.

811
00:43:41.074 --> 00:43:43.800
- What? Yeah. I know.
Misspelling'll throw 'em off.

812
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.803
You could leave it as like a calling card.

813
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.740
What do you want?

814
00:43:53.536 --> 00:43:54.369
Hm?

815
00:43:55.391 --> 00:43:56.640
- Hm?

816
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.440
- I mean. we got all the
opportunity in the world.

817
00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.893
So. what do you want?

818
00:44:00.878 --> 00:44:02.228
- Well. I want Mama to get better.

819
00:44:02.228 --> 00:44:04.740
- No. puppet. What do you want. huh?

820
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.363
What do you. Baron. need?

821
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.892
- Oh you. I want you.

822
00:44:09.892 --> 00:44:11.929
(Marmalade giggles)
I need you.

823
00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:12.762
- Hm.

824
00:44:13.753 --> 00:44:15.033
I want you too.

825
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.263
I want this. I want us.

826
00:44:24.209 --> 00:44:26.292
But this is the only way.

827
00:44:28.507 --> 00:44:31.042
And we gotta do this.

828
00:44:31.042 --> 00:44:34.209
(soft haunting music)

829
00:44:40.425 --> 00:44:44.425
(soft haunting music continues)

830
00:44:49.117 --> 00:44:53.284
(soft haunting music intensifies)

831
00:44:59.526 --> 00:45:02.943
(intense haunting music)

832
00:45:07.804 --> 00:45:11.221
(intense haunting music)

833
00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:22.883
(intense haunting music)

834
00:45:28.078 --> 00:45:30.291
(Eda coughs)

835
00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:31.124
- I gotta go check on Mama.

836
00:45:31.124 --> 00:45:32.563
- No. she's fine. She's fine. baby.

837
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:33.750
- I gotta go rub her feet. okay?

838
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.330
- I can do it. All right?

839
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:37.673
- All right.
- I can do it.

840
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.313
She's just as much my mama now too.

841
00:45:42.997 --> 00:45:47.700
(footsteps clomp)
(Eda coughs)

842
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.703
- Sometimes I ask God
how come people get sick?

843
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.500
Some of 'em just get better and better.

844
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.723
but some of 'em just get worse and worse.

845
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.660
If'n he creates all good. then
he gotta create all evil too.

846
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.014
Sure makes you wonder
how far we all gotta go

847
00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:08.733
for the ones we love.

848
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.270
Especially when things go all twisted.

849
00:46:15.456 --> 00:46:18.373
While there is life. there is hope.

850
00:46:19.938 --> 00:46:21.061
(Marmalade screams)

851
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:22.564
- [Marmalade] Oh my god. fuck.

852
00:46:22.564 --> 00:46:23.593
- What happened.
- Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

853
00:46:23.593 --> 00:46:24.687
fuck. I don't know.
- What happened?

854
00:46:24.687 --> 00:46:25.573
- [Marmalade] I don't know. I just fucking

855
00:46:25.573 --> 00:46:26.703
went to the kitchen and I came back

856
00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:28.807
and she just fucking laying
there looking like this.

857
00:46:28.807 --> 00:46:29.810
- What happened?

858
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.866
- I don't know. puppet. I wasn't in here.

859
00:46:32.866 --> 00:46:36.403
What's wrong with her?
Fuck. is she dead. puppet?

860
00:46:36.403 --> 00:46:39.561
What's wrong with her? (cries)
I don't wanna look at her.

861
00:46:39.561 --> 00:46:43.061
(medical equipment beeps)

862
00:46:45.768 --> 00:46:49.435
(medical machine flatlines)

863
00:46:51.303 --> 00:46:54.636
(grass rustles lightly)

864
00:47:01.456 --> 00:47:04.539
(wind whips lightly)

865
00:47:09.528 --> 00:47:12.611
(wind whips lightly)

866
00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:18.176
- [Otis] You all right?

867
00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:27.807
- They just kept raising
the price of that medicine.

868
00:47:34.522 --> 00:47:36.567
(Baron sniffles)

869
00:47:36.567 --> 00:47:38.027
- Hey look here. blood.

870
00:47:39.708 --> 00:47:42.250
I know it uh. don't help much.

871
00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:46.413
but my mom's been sick my whole life.

872
00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.780
I don't even know if she's still alive.

873
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.273
- You don't talk?

874
00:47:55.974 --> 00:48:00.163
- No. she in Kingston. Jamaica.
that's where she grew up.

875
00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:03.273
And uh. we uh.

876
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.933
we. our shit's complicated. blood.

877
00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:18.184
- That's the only mom you got.

878
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:21.200
Only one you'll ever get.

879
00:48:22.874 --> 00:48:24.690
(stick clangs on cell bars)

880
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.070
- [Guard] Give them great meals

881
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.550
and they will eat like
wolves and fight like devils.

882
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:31.530
- All right. look. I
can get shit straight.

883
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:32.415
but you need go at tell--

884
00:48:32.415 --> 00:48:34.417
- I ain't even tell the
whole story yet though.

885
00:48:34.417 --> 00:48:36.715
- Hey fool. we ain't got much time.

886
00:48:36.715 --> 00:48:38.100
(cell door bangs)

887
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.883
- We are time's subjects.
and time bids us begone.

888
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.560
Shakespeare sermonising. hosted
by yours truly every Friday

889
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.210
during rec if you're so inclined.

890
00:48:53.629 --> 00:48:55.230
(stick bangs on cell bars)

891
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.210
- Hey. sit your ass. hey. hey.

892
00:48:58.456 --> 00:49:00.300
All right. look here. it's chow time.

893
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.710
You gonna go out there and eat your slop.

894
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.347
but what you not gonna do is
cry on these motherfuckers

895
00:49:03.347 --> 00:49:04.983
like a little bitch. all right?

896
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.200
Cripple your ass for real.

897
00:49:09.439 --> 00:49:10.863
Here. take that. take that.

898
00:49:18.359 --> 00:49:19.192
(Otis sniffles)

899
00:49:19.192 --> 00:49:20.781
All right. (sniffles)

900
00:49:20.781 --> 00:49:23.760
(clears throat) Head up. Walk tall.

901
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.073
You know what I'm saying?
Chest out. Come on.

902
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.466
Clinch your butt cheeks.

903
00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:33.466
(deep tense music)
(inmates chatter quietly)

904
00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:42.871
(deep tense music)
(inmates chatter quietly)

905
00:49:43.816 --> 00:49:46.316
(tray clinks)

906
00:49:50.684 --> 00:49:52.543
(food swipes)

907
00:49:52.543 --> 00:49:53.833
(tray clinks)

908
00:49:53.833 --> 00:49:56.250
(face thuds)

909
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:59.650
(fork clinks)

910
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.077
(soft tense music)

911
00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:14.202
- I think you got something in your braid.

912
00:50:14.202 --> 00:50:17.199
(soft boom)

913
00:50:17.199 --> 00:50:20.616
(inmate grumbles softly)

914
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:30.829
(adventurous music)
(inmates yell)

915
00:50:32.682 --> 00:50:35.415
- Get up. get up. get up. get up. get up.

916
00:50:35.415 --> 00:50:36.248
Come on. get up.

917
00:50:36.248 --> 00:50:37.312
Behind your back.
- What? What? What?

918
00:50:37.312 --> 00:50:40.852
(alarm blares)
(guards speak indistinctly)

919
00:50:40.852 --> 00:50:42.800
- Oh man. you gonna try
and do somethin'? Huh. huh?

920
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.633
- Let's go.

921
00:50:43.633 --> 00:50:48.120
(Otis and guards drown
out by alarm blaring)

922
00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.234
(cell door lock clicks)

923
00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:52.234
- Get your ass in there.

924
00:50:54.455 --> 00:50:57.666
(cell door bangs shut)

925
00:50:57.666 --> 00:50:59.999
Well? What are you gonna do?

926
00:51:01.084 --> 00:51:04.814
(soft tense music)

927
00:51:04.814 --> 00:51:07.647
(handcuffs click)

928
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.410
Whoo. Sorry about that. boss.

929
00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.990
- I'm guessing the guy with
the tattoos isn't with us?

930
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.954
- No. he's not one of ours.

931
00:51:20.954 --> 00:51:21.960
He's a great look though. huh?

932
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.670
- Special agent?
- Yeah.

933
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:24.930
- Detective Grey.

934
00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.750
Local. Solid. Solid work.

935
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.490
Think we might have a bit of a problem.

936
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.440
- Wait. what? What problem?

937
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.570
- Between you and me. I think
you left your idiots guide

938
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.497
to Ebonics up there. (laughs)

939
00:51:35.497 --> 00:51:36.360
"What up. blood?"

940
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.090
I mean. I don't think
I've heard that ever.

941
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.490
- Are you serious right now?

942
00:51:41.915 --> 00:51:44.070
- That didn't come out
quite like I wanted it to.

943
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.233
Um. the team's over here.

944
00:51:48.823 --> 00:51:49.656
- Hey. Hey.
(agents clap)

945
00:51:49.656 --> 00:51:51.330
- Is everyone up to speed?

946
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:53.970
We just. thank you.

947
00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.460
All right. there's not much
time left. I need a re-patch.

948
00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.320
Let's go. let's go. let's go. let's go.

949
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.473
- We think you've been
pushing him a little too far.

950
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:03.990
We're gonna take it from here.

951
00:52:05.103 --> 00:52:07.170
- I'm. I'm sorry. You are?

952
00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.204
- Chief Aldo Dixon.

953
00:52:09.204 --> 00:52:10.410
- All right. well look here. Chief.

954
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.390
This Marmalade is my Bug Bay Bandit.

955
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.833
- In my jurisdiction.

956
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:20.130
I almost had him singing about
his little gal pal before.

957
00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.680
And I wasn't even playing dress up.

958
00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.270
- Chief. all due respect.

959
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.800
I've been chasing her for two years.

960
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.650
- You don't even know
it's the same broad yet.

961
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:29.543
- For real? Okay.

962
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.890
Bug Bay Bandit. also known
as the Baby Doll Bandit.

963
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.410
Multiple robberies. all with the same MO.

964
00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:40.140
See. she wears the same
pink baby doll dress.

965
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.590
Look. Same handwriting. same
misspellings. all right?

966
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.750
Zero trace. This is the only lead we have.

967
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.730
- I'm taking him back
down for questioning.

968
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.233
- Sir. please don't do that.

969
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:51.900
- Excuse me?

970
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.000
- All due respect. you've been listening.

971
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.070
Any alarms before that meet.

972
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.180
she disappears all over again.

973
00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.830
- Exactly right.

974
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:01.170
- Sir. you're never gonna believe this.

975
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:02.730
He's asking for a phone call.

976
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.080
- We can trace that.

977
00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.370
- Absolutely not.

978
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.420
- I already wired it. sir.

979
00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.320
- Then. fuck!

980
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.092
- [Digital Voice] Leave
a message after the beep.

981
00:53:09.092 --> 00:53:09.925
(voicemail beeps)

982
00:53:09.925 --> 00:53:11.553
- Hello? Marmalade?

983
00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:20.010
I don't know if you're gonna hear this.

984
00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.617
but they done got me.

985
00:53:21.617 --> 00:53:24.297
But don't you worry. I'm coming.

986
00:53:24.297 --> 00:53:27.047
This nice man in here is gonna...

987
00:53:28.604 --> 00:53:32.460
You. you just gotta meet me at our spot.

988
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.163
3:30. like you done said. Okay?

989
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.330
Can't wait to see you again.

990
00:53:40.987 --> 00:53:43.387
I'll take good care of you. I promise you.

991
00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.797
It's Baron. by the way.

992
00:53:53.364 --> 00:53:55.833
(phone receiver clicks)

993
00:53:55.833 --> 00:53:57.510
- [Dixon] You ain't
taking him outta my jail.

994
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:01.170
- Look. he shows us the way.
we come right back here again.

995
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:04.230
- There ain't no way
that she is gonna show.

996
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:05.520
- It's the only chance we got.

997
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.170
- Governor might allow a partial pardon.

998
00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.003
- No time.

999
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:13.710
- That boy is dumber
than a box of crayons.

1000
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.203
Now there ain't no way
that he is gonna break.

1001
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:18.723
unless. well.

1002
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.253
someone makes him break.

1003
00:54:25.525 --> 00:54:26.358
Mm.

1004
00:54:27.858 --> 00:54:30.086
(chuckles) Yeah.

1005
00:54:30.086 --> 00:54:30.919
(both laugh)

1006
00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:31.752
Yeah.

1007
00:54:31.752 --> 00:54:32.833
- All right.
- Yeah.

1008
00:54:32.833 --> 00:54:34.650
- All right. I'm going back in.

1009
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:36.030
He doesn't talk. you know what to do.

1010
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:37.320
We're going Jack Rabbit parole.

1011
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.670
Fill Detective Grey in here.

1012
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:39.990
- Jack what?

1013
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.823
Rabbit what?

1014
00:54:41.775 --> 00:54:45.442
(inmates chatter distantly)

1015
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.707
(soft tense music)

1016
00:54:59.622 --> 00:55:02.539
(soft tense music)

1017
00:55:03.776 --> 00:55:05.880
- Hey. put my shit down. blood.

1018
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.480
Come on. finish your damn story.

1019
00:55:08.327 --> 00:55:11.190
- [Baron] Well. after Mama went to heaven.

1020
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.950
I figured we didn't need
to rob no dang bank.

1021
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:15.150
- We gotta stay on track. puppet.

1022
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.137
we gotta stick to our plan--

1023
00:55:16.137 --> 00:55:17.340
- No. no. I already decided.

1024
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.660
I'm gonna go back to the
post office tomorrow.

1025
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.104
I'm gonna get my job back.
- No you're not.

1026
00:55:20.104 --> 00:55:20.937
- Yes. I am.
- No. you're not.

1027
00:55:20.937 --> 00:55:22.934
No. you're not!

1028
00:55:22.934 --> 00:55:26.054
(Marmalade sighs)

1029
00:55:26.054 --> 00:55:27.721
Oh god. I fucked up.

1030
00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:33.577
(Baron sighs)

1031
00:55:34.513 --> 00:55:36.510
I told myself I was gonna wait till after

1032
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.013
the goddamn robbery.

1033
00:55:39.247 --> 00:55:41.373
Uh. I got such a big mouth!

1034
00:55:45.807 --> 00:55:47.850
(boot clatters)

1035
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.773
I wanted to wait to surprise you.

1036
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.223
- Surprise me? What's the surprise?

1037
00:55:57.257 --> 00:55:58.924
- That I'm pregnant.

1038
00:55:59.939 --> 00:56:01.272
(both chuckle)

1039
00:56:01.272 --> 00:56:03.318
I'm fucking pregnant.

1040
00:56:03.318 --> 00:56:06.423
Uh-huh. and we're gonna have
a little puppet. puppet.

1041
00:56:06.423 --> 00:56:09.340
(Marmalade laughs)

1042
00:56:11.323 --> 00:56:13.830
(wood cracks)

1043
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:18.600
- Uh. dear. sweet Lord.
I pray that you up there.

1044
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.870
and Mama. you take
Marmalade and our little one

1045
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.750
in your arms today and protect
them during the stick up.

1046
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.313
'Cause Lord knows we are scared.

1047
00:56:26.313 --> 00:56:28.890
- (laughs) I'm sorry. you're scared.

1048
00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:30.600
and you just told me you're not
even going in the dang bank.

1049
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.433
Okay.

1050
00:56:31.433 --> 00:56:33.120
- Well I told you I'm gonna
be the getaway driver.

1051
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.140
Okay?
- Cool. cool. cool.

1052
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:34.973
cool. cool. cool.

1053
00:56:34.973 --> 00:56:36.010
- Yeah.
- Great stuff.

1054
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:38.130
- Amen.

1055
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.510
- Just to be clear is it.

1056
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.788
is it gonna be you or
Jesus taking the wheel?

1057
00:56:41.788 --> 00:56:42.750
Just wondering.

1058
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:43.710
- It's gonna be both of us.

1059
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.330
- That's good. That's good news.

1060
00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:46.688
- All right. Gear up. puppet boy.

1061
00:56:46.688 --> 00:56:48.869
(bold rhythmic music)

1062
00:56:48.869 --> 00:56:51.883
(toaster clicks)

1063
00:56:51.883 --> 00:56:55.050
(bold rhythmic music)

1064
00:56:59.701 --> 00:57:00.891
(Marmalade growls)

1065
00:57:00.891 --> 00:57:03.543
(Marmalade exhales sharply)

1066
00:57:03.543 --> 00:57:04.760
(zipper scratches)

1067
00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.020
(boot stomps)

1068
00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.187
(bold rhythmic music)

1069
00:57:16.154 --> 00:57:18.071
Hey. where's your mask?

1070
00:57:19.701 --> 00:57:22.469
Puppet. you have one freaking job.

1071
00:57:22.469 --> 00:57:26.136
(mysterious rhythmic music)

1072
00:57:31.264 --> 00:57:34.931
(mysterious rhythmic music)

1073
00:57:37.497 --> 00:57:40.414
(can engine roars)

1074
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.177
(brakes squeal)

1075
00:57:51.224 --> 00:57:53.614
Okay. (breathes heavily)

1076
00:57:53.614 --> 00:57:55.781
And number eight. the job.

1077
00:57:56.843 --> 00:57:57.676
All right.

1078
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.370
Gotta double mask it.

1079
00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:03.990
For extra protection.

1080
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:08.557
- Hey. Hey. I'm worried
about you. both of you.

1081
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.480
- All right. look at me.
Leave the car running.

1082
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.030
When I come out. you fuckin'
gun it like a bat outta hell.

1083
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.863
Okay?

1084
00:58:21.116 --> 00:58:24.533
(Baron breathes heavily)

1085
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.931
- Wait. Wait.

1086
00:58:30.931 --> 00:58:31.764
- What?

1087
00:58:31.764 --> 00:58:35.931
(tense haunting percussion music)

1088
00:58:45.951 --> 00:58:49.034
(singing in Spanish)

1089
00:58:56.712 --> 00:58:59.795
(singing in Spanish)

1090
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:09.733
(singing in Spanish)

1091
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:17.383
- [Singer] Uh-oh.

1092
00:59:17.383 --> 00:59:19.380
- (claps) What're you doing?

1093
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.463
Get in the driver's seat.

1094
00:59:23.973 --> 00:59:26.723
(car door slams)

1095
00:59:28.139 --> 00:59:30.244
(car door slams)

1096
00:59:30.244 --> 00:59:33.661
(Baron breathes heavily)

1097
00:59:36.267 --> 00:59:40.788
- Oh. geez. (breathes heavily)

1098
00:59:40.788 --> 00:59:44.038
(intense music swells)

1099
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.586
(gunshots blasts)

1100
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.336
- Go. go. go. go. go!

1101
00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:55.151
(car engine revs)

1102
00:59:55.151 --> 00:59:56.430
- Get in. get in.
- Go. go. go.

1103
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:57.597
- Get in.
- Go!

1104
00:59:59.366 --> 01:00:03.033
(lively singing in Spanish)

1105
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:13.077
(lively singing in Spanish)

1106
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.110
(Marmalade laughs)

1107
01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:25.443
(both yell)

1108
01:00:30.084 --> 01:00:31.798
(Marmalade yelps)

1109
01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:35.670
(upbeat Latin music)

1110
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.702
(Marmalade giggles)

1111
01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:41.202
(Marmalade yells happily)

1112
01:00:44.828 --> 01:00:49.808
Money. money. money. money. (laughs)

1113
01:00:49.808 --> 01:00:51.866
- How much is that?

1114
01:00:51.866 --> 01:00:53.283
- Um. like a lot.

1115
01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:56.621
(laughs) Like a lot. a lot.

1116
01:00:56.621 --> 01:00:58.248
(Baron chuckles hesitantly)

1117
01:00:58.248 --> 01:01:00.450
- I thought you said we just
need a little to get started.

1118
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:03.428
but this seems like
more than just a little.

1119
01:01:03.428 --> 01:01:04.980
(Marmalade sputters)

1120
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.181
- Well. I guess we got lucky.

1121
01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:10.893
- I don't know. somethin'
doesn't smell right.

1122
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.100
- Well. I can't smell. remember?

1123
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.387
- No. it's not that. It's just uh...

1124
01:01:23.583 --> 01:01:25.475
- You're a freaking
worrywart. you know that?

1125
01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:28.642
- I know. I. I know. It's just. a lot.

1126
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:31.436
- Yeah. it's a lot.

1127
01:01:31.436 --> 01:01:34.617
(laughs) Damn straight. So what?

1128
01:01:34.617 --> 01:01:37.023
Must've just gotten a delivery today.

1129
01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.800
- How'd you know that?

1130
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.106
- I don't. Just fuckin' dumb luck.

1131
01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:49.200
- (chuckles) Uh. how
come you know so much?

1132
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.033
- About what?

1133
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.960
- I don't know about this. about that.

1134
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.223
about. about everything.

1135
01:01:58.536 --> 01:02:01.893
- (scoffs) What's it matter?

1136
01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.151
- You said that when we
start our dream life--

1137
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:10.650
- This is our dream life.
It's already started.

1138
01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:12.663
- Okay. so tell me the truth.

1139
01:02:15.147 --> 01:02:17.730
(insects buzz)

1140
01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:27.619
(Marmalade sighs)

1141
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:31.550
- Promise you won't get mad?

1142
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.773
- Yeah.

1143
01:02:39.894 --> 01:02:43.561
(Marmalade exhales sharply)

1144
01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.933
- I might've done this once before.

1145
01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:48.573
A small bank out in Bug Bay.

1146
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.683
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1147
01:02:59.797 --> 01:03:02.253
And another couple a banks too.

1148
01:03:04.039 --> 01:03:07.170
(laughs) Fuck.

1149
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.910
But they were all fuckin'.
fuckin' chump change. you know?

1150
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:12.743
Fuckin' pennies.

1151
01:03:12.743 --> 01:03:15.810
It was nothing like
this. nothing like this.

1152
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.970
I wanted to throw in the
towel. puppet. I really did.

1153
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.120
but. (sighs) fuck. then I met you.

1154
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.120
And I wanted. the whole
fuckin' world. and the moon.

1155
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.182
- We gotta give this back.

1156
01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:33.000
(Marmalade laughs)

1157
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.413
- Um. well no. we can't. We can't do that.

1158
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.700
- This was supposed to
be for Mama's pills.

1159
01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:44.163
I think I need a minute.

1160
01:03:49.918 --> 01:03:53.335
(insects buzz and chirp)

1161
01:04:02.058 --> 01:04:04.975
(picture clatters)

1162
01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:08.931
(Baron passes gas)

1163
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.513
- Look. puppet.

1164
01:04:14.086 --> 01:04:15.419
I don't wanna...

1165
01:04:18.072 --> 01:04:19.572
Did you just fart?

1166
01:04:22.712 --> 01:04:24.412
- Wait. I thought you can't smell?

1167
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:30.290
- Well I can't. But you got
this weird fuckin'. guilty...

1168
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.973
Look. whatever. I. I don't
wanna fight with you. puppet.

1169
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.130
- My mind. You know I got a
lot stuck in there right now.

1170
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.930
- Just remember. it's me and you

1171
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.543
against the whole wide world.

1172
01:04:46.914 --> 01:04:49.454
- Yeah. And our baby.
- Huh?

1173
01:04:49.454 --> 01:04:50.972
- Our baby.

1174
01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:53.305
- Yeah. And our baby puppet.

1175
01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:00.122
All three of us.

1176
01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:01.984
- Yeah.

1177
01:05:04.461 --> 01:05:05.544
- I love you.

1178
01:05:07.692 --> 01:05:09.109
- I love you too.

1179
01:05:13.022 --> 01:05:15.605
(insects buzz)

1180
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.373
(slow eerie music)

1181
01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:22.415
♪ I will never know ♪

1182
01:05:22.415 --> 01:05:24.919
♪ You will never show ♪

1183
01:05:24.919 --> 01:05:26.577
(knocks on door)

1184
01:05:26.577 --> 01:05:30.418
- Did the big baby get his
panties out of a bunch?

1185
01:05:30.418 --> 01:05:32.880
(laughs) I'm just playing with you.

1186
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.587
Uh. baby. will you get the
uh. the masks out the car?

1187
01:05:36.514 --> 01:05:37.347
- Why?

1188
01:05:39.515 --> 01:05:42.182
- Um. because we gotta burn 'em.

1189
01:05:45.223 --> 01:05:46.473
- Ah. burn 'em.

1190
01:05:47.562 --> 01:05:48.395
Right.

1191
01:05:49.516 --> 01:05:50.349
- Eh.

1192
01:05:52.037 --> 01:05:55.454
(insects buzz and chirp)

1193
01:05:58.994 --> 01:06:01.577
(gun clatters)

1194
01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:07.115
(pills rattle)

1195
01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:11.568
(slow haunting music)

1196
01:06:17.005 --> 01:06:20.910
Hey baby. we gotta get rid
Big Bertha sooner than later.

1197
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.810
(soft tense music)

1198
01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:24.643
Puppet?

1199
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.850
- Why do you have Mama's pills?

1200
01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:41.642
- What?

1201
01:06:41.642 --> 01:06:44.309
(pills clatter)

1202
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.350
What are you?

1203
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.767
(Baron breathes heavily)

1204
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.880
Puppet. I was holding on to
those in case of an emergency.

1205
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:05.723
I put 'em in the car.
and I fuckin' forgot.

1206
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.593
Okay. I'm serious. I fuckin' forgot.

1207
01:07:11.707 --> 01:07:14.624
(soft tense music)

1208
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:20.160
We did everything we--

1209
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.273
- Stop!

1210
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:23.783
Just.

1211
01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:26.363
stop.

1212
01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:28.853
- Okay.

1213
01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:34.534
- (sighs) I can't tell--

1214
01:07:34.534 --> 01:07:36.837
- You can't tell if what?

1215
01:07:38.953 --> 01:07:41.040
- I can't tell if you're being honest.

1216
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.830
- It was just Mama Eda's time.

1217
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.473
Okay?

1218
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:48.700
It's been a really big fuckin' day.

1219
01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.560
I'm taxed. you're fuckin' taxed.

1220
01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:55.120
Let's just put the--

1221
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.953
- Don't come any closer.

1222
01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.499
- Let's put the gun down. puppet.

1223
01:08:00.499 --> 01:08:02.999
(sirens wail)

1224
01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.808
- What are we gonna do?

1225
01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:14.052
- All right. Now come on
out here or we're coming in.

1226
01:08:14.052 --> 01:08:15.075
Choice is yours.

1227
01:08:15.075 --> 01:08:16.718
- We gotta. we gotta go
outside and apologise.

1228
01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:17.550
Okay?

1229
01:08:18.448 --> 01:08:19.281
Okay?

1230
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:21.660
- All right baby. baby. Just focus. Okay?

1231
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.889
All right. We just gotta
split the money and run. Okay?

1232
01:08:25.889 --> 01:08:27.450
You know that spot that we like.

1233
01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:28.282
the spot that we talked about?

1234
01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:29.853
- Yeah.
- We go there.

1235
01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:31.283
And. and. and if one of us doesn't show.

1236
01:08:31.283 --> 01:08:32.319
then that means the other one got nabbed.

1237
01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.569
Okay?
- Okay.

1238
01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:34.740
- And uh. if that happens

1239
01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.770
then one of us just fuckin'
disappears forever. okay?

1240
01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:39.510

You know what I'm saying?

You had your finger on the trigger. dog.

Remember that? You ever think
she ain't planning on showing?

1284
01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.719
- Do you believe our love?

1285
01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:02.223
'Cause I know what I know.
and I done feel what I feel.

1286

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.678

- I know. and Chief interfered.

1330
01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.160
We couldn't get here in time.

1331

1332
01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:24.826

1333
01:14:24.826 --> 01:14:26.570

It's all a bit intense. brother.

your performance as well.

1348
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.133

- Well. hopefully something
for her with any luck.

1355
01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:26.250
Jesus. be a miracle if
he can make it anywhere

1356
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.083
in that lemon.

1357

I mean. where'd we find
this piece of shit?

1358
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:31.139

- [Otis] You only get one mama.

1369
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:21.740
- You really took a
shine to that kid. huh?

1370
01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:27.045
- Poor guy. He'll do
five to 10 for accessory.

1371
01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:27.960
- Ooh.

1372
01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.559

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.323
And knock on wood. his girl as well.

1374

- Be advised. location
could be a nest egg.

1380
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.070
Keep your eyes peeled for a positive ID.

1381
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:12.713
- [Police Officer] Hey. Roger that.

1382
01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.070
- [Cambio] Why's he stopping here?

1383
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:18.543

Oh. come on. Marmalade. where you at?

1398
01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:07.380
Hang back. hang back.

1399
01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.080
He's seeing if anyone's following.

1400
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.602
This is it.

1401
01:18:11.602 --> 01:18:14.102
(tense music)

1402
01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:17.047
- [Gray] Oh. do you see her?

Do not move.

1412
01:18:34.889 --> 01:18:36.440
- He said I could keep the car.

1413
01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:40.290
(driver shudders)

1414
01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.180

Make sure all the perimeter
checkpoints are locked down.

1421
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:16.170
They cannot get away.

1422
01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.522
- Now special agent. where are you going?

1423
01:19:18.522 --> 01:19:22.189

1434
01:20:32.276 --> 01:20:35.152
I don't know what you're talking about.

1435
01:20:35.152 --> 01:20:39.277
No. I don't. no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1436
01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:42.527
I don't know what you're talking about.

1437
01:20:43.607 --> 01:20:45.210
- Do you have the. uh. uh. uh.

1438
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:47.483

Move. move. move. Move. move.

(tense suspenseful music)

1444
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.780
- Shit.

1445
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.612
- What?

1446
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.032

- Sir. what should they be
looking for at the perimeter now?

1467
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:47.993
- You know what?

1468
01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:50.070
I have no idea which way
we're facing right now.

1469
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.903
No fucking clue.

I just. all right just. change it back to

1471
01:22:53.977 --> 01:22:57.317
a lone male suspect. Southern drawl.

I don't. I don't. I don't.
I don't. I don't know.

01:22:59.107 --> 01:22:59.940
I don't know.

1474
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:00.900
- Copy that.

1475
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.240
Wait. what. what about the girl?

1476
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.202
- There is no girl.

1477
01:23:07.474 --> 01:23:08.587
- What?

1478
01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:10.005
- There is no girl.

1479
01:23:10.005 --> 01:23:12.860

(deep haunting music)

1481
01:23:21.617 --> 01:23:22.450
- Hey there.

1482
01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:23.850
- Hey. how can I help you?

1483
01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:27.300
- So. I called in an order a
few days ago for Pleonexia.

1484
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.280
- Ah. remind me of the name again.

1485
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.040
- Uh. Lamram. L-A-M-R-A-M.

1486
01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.103
- Uh. starting to think
you weren't gonna show.

1487
01:23:36.539 --> 01:23:38.163
- Well. I had a little hold up.

1488
01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:43.080
- 408 Ronson Drive. Thank you. Thank you.

1489
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.770
Sir! Sir. I got the address.

1490

1491
01:23:47.603 --> 01:23:48.719

1492
01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.469
made from the phone call in prison.

1493
01:23:52.469 --> 01:23:53.303
- Get in.

1494
01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.290
- [Cambio] Headquarters traced the number

1495
01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:01.350
back to some sort of
pharmaceutical company.

1496
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:03.327
- That's it. Lamram. Lamram.

1497
01:24:04.183 --> 01:24:05.766
Lamram. Lamram. Ah.

1498

(door bells jingle)

1499
01:24:10.098 --> 01:24:13.230
(tense music)

1500
01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:14.933
- Right here. It's right.
right. right. right. right.

1501
01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:18.812
(tyres squeal)

1502

1505
01:24:28.278 --> 01:24:30.460
- Expensive brand of drugs. huh?

1506
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.633
Damn Warbucks. Rich just
keep getting richer.

1507
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:35.423
- Where are we?

1508
01:24:35.423 --> 01:24:36.396
- I don't know what street this is.

1509
01:24:36.396 --> 01:24:37.443
- You're looking at the map.

1510
01:24:37.443 --> 01:24:38.678
- Is this Randall?

1511
01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:41.550
(tyres squeal)

1512
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:45.813
- Got my whole supply there.
every last pill. It's for you?

1513
01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.513
- No.

1514
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:54.770
They're for my mom.

1515
01:24:55.739 --> 01:24:58.473
Well. my foster mom.

1516
01:25:00.865 --> 01:25:02.825
(bag thuds)

1517
01:25:02.825 --> 01:25:05.502
(tense suspenseful music)

1518
01:25:05.502 --> 01:25:07.068
- Left. left. Here. here. here. here.

1519
01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.715
Yeah. yeah. yep. yep.

1520

(tyres squeal)

1521
01:25:11.782 --> 01:25:13.205
- You oughta been here
a little (indistinct).

1522
01:25:13.205 --> 01:25:14.538
you fucking pig.

1523
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:17.219
About goddamn time.

1524
01:25:17.219 --> 01:25:18.510
- Well. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm sorry.

1525
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:20.010
- Sorry? You should be sorry.

1526
01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:22.530
The sheriff's office said
someone would be here by noon.

1527
01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:25.380
- Sir. I think there's
been a. a misunderstanding.

1528
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:27.873
- A block of money gone kapoof.

1529
01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.860
Misunderstanding. my asshole.

1530
01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.290
- Well. sir. I. I'm sorry I don't follow.

1531
01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:36.450
- I used to transit through Bug Bay.

1532
01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:38.013
and that shit hole was ripping us too.

1533
01:25:38.013 --> 01:25:39.719
- Sir. you said Bug Bay?

1534
01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:42.360
- Are you deaf? Yes. Bug Bay.

1535
01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.550
What're y'all. just sitting
around with your thumbs up

1536
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:45.870
your prison purses.

1537
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:46.702
- Wait a minute now.

1538
01:25:46.702 --> 01:25:49.287
It was your money that
was stolen in the robbery?

1539
01:25:49.287 --> 01:25:53.430
- Oh. dear god. Am I not speaking English?

1540
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:55.500
Half a million fucking dollars of mine

1541
01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.330
was stolen from some
podunk bank yesterday.

1542
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:02.010
- Okay. Okay. Let's just all calm down.

1543
01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:05.403
Sir. is this your place of business?

1544
01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:09.273
- Goddamn right. Don Frankels. CEO.

1545
01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:13.230
(eerie music)

1546
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:14.580
- Baron Pharmaceuticals.

1547
01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.200
- [Don] Insurance company

1549
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.763
- Baron Pharmaceuticals.

1550
01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.763
Sir. you don't make the
drug Pleonexia by chance?

1551
01:26:27.763 --> 01:26:31.383
- (laughs) Yes sir. we do.

1552
01:26:32.893 --> 01:26:33.726
(Otis chuckles)

1553
01:26:33.726 --> 01:26:36.180
You know. I. I'm guessing that
y'all ain't got no updates

1554
01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:40.068
for me. so. kindly just scuttle
the fuck off my property

1555
01:26:40.068 --> 01:26:43.320
and go find my bills.

1556
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.763
Sons of bitches. worthless.

1557
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.440
- Mr. Frankels. Excuse me. sir.

1558
01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.273
- What?

1559
01:26:55.139 --> 01:26:56.463
- Do you foster children?

1560
01:26:59.190 --> 01:27:00.023
- Come again?

1561
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:03.753
- Foster children. you
have any. or have you ever?

1562
01:27:05.121 --> 01:27:07.920
- Uh. the fuck that's
gotta do with anything?

1563
01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.673
- Do you foster children?

1564
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:17.833
- Damn right I do.

1565
01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:21.960
You take a bunch a junkie rejects

1566
01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.559
and you make 'em into something.

1567
01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.823
- We'll be in touch.

1568
01:27:34.559 --> 01:27:35.523
- Useless pricks.

1569
01:27:37.466 --> 01:27:40.799
(slow mysterious music)

1570
01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:46.407
Linda. get the goddamn
sheriff on the phone.

1571
01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:49.163
- [Gray] What was that about?

1572
01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.969
- Everything's a puzzle piece.

1573
01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:52.380
Find his address. send a unit over

1574
01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.570
to Mr. Frankel's house immediately.

1575
01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:56.120
- Wait a minute now. What's up?

1576
01:27:57.393 --> 01:28:00.059
- I just. I. I. I got a feeling that I.

1577
01:28:00.059 --> 01:28:02.340
we'll find something.

1578
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:05.760
- Requesting a home address
for a Don or Donald Frankels.

1579
01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.530
- Tell 'em to look for a back garage or.

1580
01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.224
or speak to the foster kids.

1581
01:28:09.224 --> 01:28:10.705
- All right. be on the
lookout for a garage.

1582
01:28:10.705 --> 01:28:12.450
- Find something like what?

1583
01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:17.450
- I don't know. Cages. maybe.

1584
01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.353
- Cages?

1585
01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.559
Cages. You think that he's--

1586
01:28:22.559 --> 01:28:24.630
- Marmalade said that
her abuser had a cane

1587
01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:26.490
and a slight twitch in
his eye when he got mad.

1588
01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:27.809
Does that ring any bells?

1589
01:28:27.809 --> 01:28:28.643
- Sir?

1590
01:28:28.643 --> 01:28:29.476
- Yeah.

1591
01:28:29.476 --> 01:28:31.500
- There's a unit. a block
away from his house.

1592
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.780
It has a garage. and
outside they just spotted

1593
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.898
a jar of marmalade.

1594
01:28:35.898 --> 01:28:37.391
(hand smacks)

1595
01:28:37.391 --> 01:28:38.318
(sirens chirp)

1596
01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:39.277
- [Police Officer] (indistinct) Now.

1597
01:28:39.277 --> 01:28:43.693
(indistinct) when we process him in.

1598
01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.023
- Three cages. apparently.

1599
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.260
No recent use. luckily.

1600
01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.623
but evidence all over the place.

1601
01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.559
- Chief's questioning the foster kids now.

1602
01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:03.782
- So. what's real. hm?
What's real? What's fake?

1603
01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.103
- Could use a drink.

1604
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:12.603
- Well. there's a watering
hole about a block over.

1605
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:15.110
- I'll meet you there.

1606
01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:20.153
- A man in his lifetime plays many parts.

1607
01:29:27.653 --> 01:29:32.653
- Come on now. First round's
on me. blood. (laughs)

1608
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.960
I'll never do it again. sir.

1609
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.793
- No.

1610
01:29:42.367 --> 01:29:47.367
(indistinct police radio
chatter in background)

1611
01:29:47.651 --> 01:29:50.151
(Velcro rips)

1612
01:29:53.877 --> 01:29:56.794
(soft tense music)

1613
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:02.663
(haunting music swells)

1614
01:30:09.427 --> 01:30:14.427
(footsteps shuffle)
(soft tense music)

1615
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.120
(door bells jingle)

1616
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.790
- Afternoon. FBI. Did
you happen to see a man--

1617
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:27.990
- I got nothing to do with it.

1618
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.068
I don't know nothing about all this.

1619
01:30:30.068 --> 01:30:32.568
(badge thuds)

1620
01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:36.450
He got his pills and he disappeared

1621
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.013
like a fart in a fan factory.

1622
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:42.000
- I'm sorry. um. I'm
sorry. what. what pills?

1623
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.200
- Pleonexia.

1624
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.280
- For what?

1625
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.360
- I don't know. For his mom.
Look. I don't need any--

1626
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.320
- Where'd he go?

1627
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.719
- Said he was buying
tickets. around the corner.

1628
01:30:53.776 --> 01:30:56.276
(car rumbles)

1629
01:30:58.496 --> 01:31:01.496
(suspenseful music)

1630
01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:10.958
(tropical music)

1631
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:17.093
- Aloha. Bonjour. Don't just
book it. Thomas Cook it.

1632
01:31:17.093 --> 01:31:19.200
- How you doing? I was wondering--

1633
01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.282
- Agent Huxley?

1634
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.680
- Yeah?

1635
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.740
- Wonderful. wonderful. wonderful.

1636
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:28.503
I've got everything all set right here.

1637
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:33.719
FBI. (laughs)

1638
01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:35.160
Sh.

1639
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:35.993
- I'm. I'm...

1640
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.660
- He said you were gonna be right over.

1641
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.240
Uh. I didn't realise it was gonna be

1642
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.490
so lickety split though.

1643
01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:46.410
I mean. it's a. it's a. it's a good thing.

1644
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:47.510
I. I. (clears throat).

1645
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:51.993
He left a note for ya.

1646
01:31:53.670 --> 01:31:56.639
I'm uh. very sorry for your loss.

1647
01:31:56.639 --> 01:31:57.473
- My what?

1648
01:31:58.466 --> 01:31:59.612
- I might've peaked.

1649
01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.240
If you need me. I'm here.

1650
01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.370
- I need you to stop reading
people's mail. It's illegal.

1651
01:32:11.309 --> 01:32:14.142
(door bangs shut)

1652
01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:22.784
(gentle music)

1653
01:32:24.452 --> 01:32:27.123
- [Baron] Life can only
be understood backwards.

1654
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.303
but it must be lived forwards.

1655
01:32:31.469 --> 01:32:34.743
I'm taking care of my mother.
I hope you'll do the same.

1656
01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.733
Farewell. secret agent.

1657
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.183
