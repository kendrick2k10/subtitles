3
00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:00.207
The other side of the world.

4
00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.124
I wonder if I've gone
far enough.

5
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.997
Perhaps it's as my father said.

6
00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:10.347
"No matter how far you run.

7
00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:13.002
you can never
escape yourself."

8
00:03:19.547 --> 00:03:21.766
This is it?
There's nothing here.

9
00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:23.725
It's unknown. Arthur.

10
00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:25.944
Everything's here.

11
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.512
-Do we claim it for England?
-You go on ahead. Charley.

12
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.951
You've wasted
your inheritance. cousin.

13
00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:34.562
Exactly as your
father predicted.

14
00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:39.175
Subu says Borneo's got Malay
princes and Dayak headhunters.

15
00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:41.221
Yes. precisely.

16
00:03:41.308 --> 00:03:42.526
And pirates.

17
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.442
I should like
to meet a pirate.

18
00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:48.793
I wouldn't go in there alone.

19
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.317
If something happens.

20
00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:52.884
there's no Royal Navy
coming to save us.

21
00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:55.539
Charley!

22
00:03:55.626 --> 00:03:57.237
Unload the boat.

23
00:03:58.412 --> 00:04:00.501
Charley. come on.

24
00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.982
-Here. take this.
- Whoo!

25
00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.221
Beautiful.

26
00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.039
Charley. Bird-wing butterfly.

27
00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:11.223
Subu.

28
00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:14.139
We may as well
take tea here.

29
00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:16.664
Yes. Tuan.

30
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.956
-

31
00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:57.531
Put it away. Arthur.

32
00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:01.143
Tribes around here
are friendly.

33
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.363
Yes.

34
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.452
I can see that.

35
00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:30.215
How long must one
smoke the heads?

36
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.408
He says until the eyes melt.

37
00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:07.427
We are to be brought
to Prince Bedruddin.

38
00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:08.906
who will decide.

39
00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.387
Decide what. exactly?

40
00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:36.107
I am Prince Makota.

41
00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:39.110
the Governor of Sarawak.

42
00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:43.767
And my cousin. Prince Bedruddin.
the emissary of the Sultan.

43
00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:53.864
Do all English lords
speak the language of God?

44
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.650
I had a good teacher.

45
00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:59.130
He said God speaks
in all languages.

46
00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:01.002
If only men will listen.

47
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:08.705
-When the Sultan dies...
-Yeah.

48
00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.794
...one of them will become
the Sultan of Brunei.

49
00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:16.060
Allow me to introduce my cousin.

50
00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:18.236
Colonel Arthur Crookshank.

51
00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:19.977
of Her Majesty's army.

52
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:21.370
Good afternoon.

53
00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:23.633
Do you come on behalf
of England?

54
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.070
I come on behalf of Her Majesty.
Queen Victoria.

55
00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:29.944
whose empire is so vast
the sun never sets upon it.

56
00:08:39.344 --> 00:08:41.956
Our Dayaks are simple farmers.

57
00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.436
They have never seen
a White man.

58
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.655
No.

59
00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:49.006
But you have.

60
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:50.355
My cousin and I.

61
00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:53.054
we were paid
five English sailors

62
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:55.709
as tribute by Lanun raiders.

63
00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:58.494
From these Englishmen.
we have your words.

64
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.415
If you know our Quran

65
00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:09.897
then you know that we must
leave you now and pray.

66
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:11.986
Charmed.

67
00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:13.640
Just back away.

68
00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:15.250
Back away...

69
00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:40.841
Don't worry. Charley.

70
00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:42.930
I doubt they'll hurt us.

71
00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:45.454
They think we're emissaries
of the queen.

72
00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:48.283
The queen doesn't know
we're here.

73
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.285
They don't know that.

74
00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:51.982
Patience. cousin.

75
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:53.854
Statecraft.

76
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.247
Is that what
brings you here. Lord Brooke?

77
00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:57.597
Statecraft?

78
00:09:57.684 --> 00:09:59.555
Or empire?

79
00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:02.950
Neither. Sire.

80
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:06.867
We are on a voyage of discovery.
not conquest.

81
00:10:06.954 --> 00:10:08.999
Then you are most welcome.

82
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.436
I thank you.

83
00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:14.439
Might I be allowed
to go upriver...

84
00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:18.269
take specimens of plants
and animals?

85
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:36.461
We will escort you
and your lords

86
00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:38.942
to the Orang Kaya's village.

87
00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:41.249
I. too. grant you permission.

88
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:47.211
How long till they
figure out that I'm a fraud?

89
00:10:49.344 --> 00:10:51.215
I failed at school.

90
00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:53.043
The army.

91
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.089
Even marriage.

92
00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.744
I can only hope to make
some great discovery here

93
00:10:57.831 --> 00:11:01.356
that will bring credit
to my family's name

94
00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:05.186
in a way that my conduct
in England did not.

95
00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:27.208
God. this is paradise.

96
00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:35.216
What's that smell. sir?

97
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.915
Hey. look. Hey!

98
00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:41.222
Hey. look!

99
00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:46.183
Lanun Raiders.

100
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.968
Pirates.

101
00:11:48.055 --> 00:11:50.448
Protected by the rebel lords
who raid our villages.

102
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:52.712
It's a plague to our country.

103
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.539
Well. there you have it.
Pirates.

104
00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:58.630
I'd like to see for myself.
Let's take a closer look.

105
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.632
Why? There's nothing there.

106
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:03.635
Draw the birds.
They're beautiful.

107
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.986
I beg your pardon. my prince.

108
00:12:06.073 --> 00:12:09.119
Our purpose here
is to see and to record.

109
00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:12.819
Very well. then.

110
00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:54.512
Charley.

111
00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:56.210
James. look.

112
00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:57.602
By that tree.

113
00:12:57.689 --> 00:12:59.169
I'll get him. sir.

114
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.525
Got him. sir.

115
00:13:09.963 --> 00:13:11.878
Charley. bring him here.

116
00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:27.067
He says. "I'm not a murderer."
Snake People...

117
00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:28.590
Murderer. Look at his hands.

118
00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.070
Liar.

119
00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:40.123
It's all right.

120
00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:00.970
Good. You caught one.

121
00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:02.842
We don't know that.

122
00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:04.017
He was hiding.

123
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:05.409
Of course. hiding.

124
00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.455
We must stop this...

125
00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.500
chaos.

126
00:14:09.587 --> 00:14:11.241
Is that the word?

127
00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:13.243
Yes. That's the word.

128
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.290
To stop this.
we must take the rebel fort.

129
00:14:18.118 --> 00:14:20.860
We understand your vessel
has many cannons. Lord Brooke.

130
00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:23.950
Enough to defend ourselves.
Sire. yes.

131
00:14:24.037 --> 00:14:27.083
We would like to see
these cannons.

132
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:33.394
What do these smiling
princes want from me?

133
00:14:35.004 --> 00:14:37.180
The last time I killed
for an empire.

134
00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:39.617
the British left me for dead.

135
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.405
I should turn back.
set sail.

136
00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:47.582
Instead. I find myself
sucked deeper upriver.

137
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:50.280
like the current truckling
at roots of trees

138
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:52.979
to drown the unwary
in its murk.

139
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:57.070
But I do not resist.

140
00:14:57.157 --> 00:15:00.116
For here. I am a stranger.
even to myself.

141
00:15:58.218 --> 00:15:59.828
My Lord Brooke.

142
00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:02.570
You've brought a good omen.

143
00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:04.267
The bird tells them

144
00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:06.661
the man with the curious
white skin is a good spirit.

145
00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:07.923
and not an evil one.

146
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.751
They don't know you like I do.

147
00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:16.758
My father says.
meet my sisters.

148
00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:18.368
- Charley.

149
00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:20.066
They're his daughters.

150
00:16:20.153 --> 00:16:21.632
No. no. no. No problem.

151
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:23.286
My sisters are not yet married.

152
00:16:23.373 --> 00:16:25.201
Can lie as much as they wish.

153
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:27.377
-You want?
- It's Dayak custom.

154
00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:29.597
His daughters can have
relations with anyone.

155
00:16:29.684 --> 00:16:31.120
but only before marriage.

156
00:16:31.207 --> 00:16:34.080
In England.
women do not lay up with men

157
00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:35.385
before they marry?

158
00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:37.692
Not if they get caught.

159
00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:41.043
Ah. Now I know why
you come to Sarawak.

160
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.702
My cousin. Fatima.

161
00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:51.010
Entrusted to Orang Kaya
as pawalian

162
00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:53.055
for his loyalty to us.

163
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.231
A hostage.

164
00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:56.580
A ward.

165
00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:58.756
To raise as his daughter.

166
00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:01.803
Captain James Brooke.

167
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.850
Allah reserves the beautiful one
for a king.

168
00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:08.505
But you may have anyone else
you desire.

169
00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:13.336
A shave. I think.

170
00:17:21.605 --> 00:17:23.259
Very beautiful.

171
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.396
Beau-ti-ful.

172
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:31.093
Yes.

173
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.703
Beautiful.

174
00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:37.317
Happy to meet you.

175
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.070
My sister Fatima says.

176
00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:52.897
"Your Semingat is very strong."

177
00:17:52.984 --> 00:17:55.074
Do you have many sons?

178
00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:57.380
No.

179
00:17:58.642 --> 00:18:00.166
Well. yes.

180
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.907
One.

181
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.998
My sister asks. where is he?

182
00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:09.566
With his mother.

183
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:17.400
Ah. my Lord.

184
00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.534
What is Semingat?

185
00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.405
Semingat?

186
00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:25.800
A king's power comes from
his Semingat.

187
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:28.237
His life force.

188
00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:29.978
Vitality.

189
00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:32.981
Measured with wives. sons.

190
00:18:33.068 --> 00:18:37.203
slaves. heads. conquests.

191
00:18:38.726 --> 00:18:42.556
And all of these
are Orang Kaya's?

192
00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:43.861
Semingat.

193
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.954
You like it here. Lord James.

194
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.392
In truth. Sire.
I am not a lord.

195
00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:54.394
Well. they think you're a god.

196
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.135
-The bird--
-Well. you tell the bird

197
00:18:56.222 --> 00:18:58.572
I'm just a traveler.

198
00:19:03.054 --> 00:19:05.231
Thank you. cousin.

199
00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:06.841
To begin the spear trading.

200
00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:09.670
I welcome Lord Brooke
with these humble gifts.

201
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.065
I thank Prince Makota.

202
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.503
But I'm afraid I have nothing
to trade in return.

203
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:20.463
You're my guest.

204
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.253
-Arthur...
-Hmm?

205
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.124
...give me your pistol.

206
00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:34.260
My father's pistol.

207
00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:36.218
On your head.

208
00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:42.224
Prince Makota.

209
00:19:42.311 --> 00:19:44.487
For your kindness.

210
00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:52.669
One more gift.

211
00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:57.631
No!

212
00:19:57.718 --> 00:19:59.937
Tuan. please. do not interfere.

213
00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:02.244
A great honor is being meant.

214
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:04.115
Oh. Christ!
Honor be damned!

215
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:08.642
Prince Makota. I thank you.

216
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:12.123
But I would be more
greatly honored

217
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:16.215
if you gave me this man's life
as a gift.

218
00:20:23.047 --> 00:20:24.832
You're looking for specimens?

219
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.801
Take this one.
It's fresh.

220
00:20:42.197 --> 00:20:45.940
Savages. we call them.

221
00:20:46.027 --> 00:20:48.464
The White man's burden
to save their souls.

222
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.989
I saw British mercy in India.

223
00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:55.079
The army strapped prisoners
to the mouths of cannon

224
00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:57.081
and blew them apart.

225
00:20:57.995 --> 00:21:00.433
Keeps the savages in line.

226
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.652
- Excuse me. Tuan.

227
00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:05.176
- Come in. Subu.

228
00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:09.355
Prince Makota is here.

229
00:21:12.053 --> 00:21:13.533
Very well.

230
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.230
Bring him down.

231
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:26.981
Prince Makota.

232
00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:31.290
What a pleasant surprise.

233
00:21:31.377 --> 00:21:33.074
You visit us.

234
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:35.468
I repay the honor.

235
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:39.472
A good likeness.
don't you think?

236
00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:42.953
I think it is better to be
Makota's friend than his enemy.

237
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:48.307
I like you.

238
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.223
So must your queen.

239
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.225
To give you the great guns
on deck.

240
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.881
Oh. those are just little
six-pounders.

241
00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:03.060
In England.

242
00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:05.585
they make it even bigger?

243
00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:07.151
Oh. any size will do.

244
00:22:07.238 --> 00:22:08.892
if you know how to use it well.

245
00:22:11.678 --> 00:22:13.636
This I tell my wives. huh?

246
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.467
How do you fire the cannons?

247
00:22:18.554 --> 00:22:21.165
Will it not destroy
repulsive creatures?

248
00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:26.475
First. you strike the specimens
into the hold.

249
00:22:26.562 --> 00:22:28.434
light the fuse...

250
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.393
and fire.

251
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.745
Most ingenious.

252
00:22:35.832 --> 00:22:39.967
Is that the word for such
a clever moving of things?

253
00:22:40.054 --> 00:22:41.447
Yes.

254
00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:43.100
That's the word.

255
00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:45.407
If you order it.

256
00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:49.498
can ingenious sailors
move the cannons

257
00:22:49.585 --> 00:22:53.894
to attack the rebel fort
upriver. at Belidah?

258
00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:56.897
Theoretically.

259
00:22:57.811 --> 00:22:59.943
So it is agreed.

260
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.642
You will lend us your guns
and bring them upriver.

261
00:23:02.729 --> 00:23:05.601
most theoretically.

262
00:23:05.688 --> 00:23:07.864
Bedruddin will pay you
much gold.

263
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.827
I'm afraid no.

264
00:23:14.784 --> 00:23:16.395
I'm here to study wildlife.

265
00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:25.708
So you say.

266
00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:30.147
That's a Brazilian
wandering spider.

267
00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:32.236
Quite venomous.

268
00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:35.849
It climbs into bananas.

269
00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.503
Delicious.

270
00:23:38.765 --> 00:23:41.724
But it's best to think
before you bite.

271
00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:48.514
Lord Brooke.

272
00:23:48.601 --> 00:23:50.080
Prince Makota.

273
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:07.097
So. what do White men call it
when princes lie to each other?

274
00:24:08.142 --> 00:24:10.057
Diplomacy.

275
00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:12.015
I never said I'd do it.

276
00:24:15.236 --> 00:24:16.846
Not even for your collection?

277
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.045
Like stars in the night.

278
00:24:45.353 --> 00:24:47.529
You're learning Malay.

279
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:48.748
Charley.

280
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:56.016
Excuse my interruption. Lord.

281
00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:57.974
But we have not discussed
your price.

282
00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:00.716
-You know my price.
-Yes. yes.

283
00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:04.459
Mercy. A high price...

284
00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:06.156
for four cannons
and three Englishmen.

285
00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:09.333
Prince Makota.
I want your word.

286
00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:11.771
No heads.

287
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.425
Of course.

288
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.079
No heads.

289
00:25:20.257 --> 00:25:22.651
Jim. you recall
the most revered Madame Lim.

290
00:25:22.738 --> 00:25:24.218
from our days in Singapore?

291
00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:25.741
Hello. James.

292
00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:27.526
Ah. Ling.

293
00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:29.223
Forgive me.

294
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.486
Madame Lim.

295
00:25:33.314 --> 00:25:34.707
I've brought your mail.

296
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:38.145
I thank you.

297
00:25:38.232 --> 00:25:39.363
Arthur?

298
00:25:40.103 --> 00:25:41.496
Excuse me.

299
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:54.509
I thank you
for your assistance.

300
00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:57.164
How did you find us
way up here?

301
00:25:57.251 --> 00:26:01.385
We have ears in all the islands.
and eyes on all of our friends.

302
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.621
So. Arthur...

303
00:26:19.708 --> 00:26:20.970
news from home?

304
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.236
A son.

305
00:26:27.498 --> 00:26:28.978
We've had a son.

306
00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:31.328
A son?

307
00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:33.679
That must be very fine. Arthur.

308
00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:43.340
She sends her regards.

309
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.213
I rather doubt that.

310
00:26:50.391 --> 00:26:52.306
You ever think of her?

311
00:26:52.393 --> 00:26:54.482
Elizabeth?

312
00:26:55.657 --> 00:26:57.267
Of course.

313
00:26:57.354 --> 00:26:58.921
And with greatest affection.

314
00:27:00.183 --> 00:27:02.272
You'll be
a wonderful father. Arthur.

315
00:27:07.408 --> 00:27:09.628
Why did I lie to him?

316
00:27:11.107 --> 00:27:12.892
Because I can't confess

317
00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:15.111
that I never
loved Elizabeth.

318
00:27:15.198 --> 00:27:18.071
and was happy
when Arthur married her.

319
00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:25.513
The only loving thing
I ever did for Liz

320
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.168
was to break our engagement

321
00:27:28.255 --> 00:27:29.691
and run away
from the scandal

322
00:27:29.778 --> 00:27:32.128
of getting another woman
with child.

323
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:35.566
Yes. I still think of Elizabeth.

324
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:40.093
But I pray she doesn't
think of me.

325
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.182
Come on. Charley.
Put your back into it. boy.

326
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:44.880
-Not this time.
-Faster! Move ahead!

327
00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:47.056
Don't let him talk
to you like that.

328
00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:48.971
Put your back into it. lad.

329
00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:50.538
Faster. Charley.

330
00:27:50.625 --> 00:27:52.758
You're catching him. Charley.
That's good.

331
00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:54.063
Come on. Charley.

332
00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:04.552
Come on. keep paddling.

333
00:28:06.467 --> 00:28:07.729
I think we've seen enough. Sire.

334
00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:09.252
What?

335
00:28:09.339 --> 00:28:11.167
There's something
I don't like about this.

336
00:28:11.254 --> 00:28:13.648
Nonsense. Rebels are noble.
They won't harm their prince.

337
00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:15.432
-Keep paddling.
- Back oars. boys.

338
00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:17.130
Back to the ship.
Back oars. Charley!

339
00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:19.393
It's not yours to give me
orders. Captain Brooke.

340
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.787
Christ!

341
00:28:21.874 --> 00:28:24.267
Charley. jump! Tujang. jump!

342
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:25.442
Prince Bedruddin. jump.

343
00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:26.705
-No.
-Jump!

344
00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:29.185
-No!
-You have to jump!

345
00:28:29.272 --> 00:28:30.578
Aah!

346
00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:34.364
Sir!

347
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:55.255
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Gentle. gentlemen. Gently.

348
00:28:55.342 --> 00:28:57.213
-Like a woman you love.

349
00:29:01.652 --> 00:29:03.916
You fear very little. James.

350
00:29:04.003 --> 00:29:06.179
I have little to lose. Sire.

351
00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:08.050
But the boy.

352
00:29:08.137 --> 00:29:10.270
he had his whole life
ahead of him.

353
00:29:11.445 --> 00:29:13.229
I'm his prince.

354
00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:15.014
He died with honor.

355
00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:22.673
You think I was too proud
to jump.

356
00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:25.154
But that's not the reason.

357
00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:29.811
I can't swim. James.

358
00:29:49.962 --> 00:29:52.486
All they do is bathe.

359
00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:55.837
Five times a day.

360
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.276
You're enjoying this.
aren't you?

361
00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:02.191
Yes. I am.

362
00:30:02.278 --> 00:30:03.671
Do you mind?

363
00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:10.634
Thank you.

364
00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:28.261
I'll put the Orang Kaya
in charge.

365
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.871
He's got fire in his belly.

366
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:31.568
We can't upset
the natural order.

367
00:30:31.655 --> 00:30:34.267
The princes rule here.

368
00:30:34.354 --> 00:30:37.270
We're observers for
the Royal Geographical Society.

369
00:30:37.357 --> 00:30:39.750
With a ship and guns
under a British flag.

370
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.188
My ship. My guns.

371
00:30:42.275 --> 00:30:43.537
In India.
we were careful

372
00:30:43.624 --> 00:30:45.278
to not interfere
in native squabbles.

373
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:46.670
Rubbish.

374
00:30:46.757 --> 00:30:48.585
That's how we got India.

375
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.418
Charley! Fire!

376
00:31:07.735 --> 00:31:08.997
Tujang. no.

377
00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:10.825
We attack together.

378
00:31:14.524 --> 00:31:17.571
Prince Makota!
We're attacking the fort!

379
00:31:17.658 --> 00:31:18.877
Where's your honor?

380
00:31:18.964 --> 00:31:21.357
Is it dishonorable
to be clean?

381
00:31:21.444 --> 00:31:24.317
Come. my bloodthirsty
Englishmen.

382
00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:39.985
Rafflesia.

383
00:31:48.863 --> 00:31:51.518
We call it the Devil's box.

384
00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:53.259
No roots.

385
00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:54.956
No leaves.

386
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:58.133
A few days of beauty.
then they pass on.

387
00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:02.224
-You know your plants.
-I know my country.

388
00:32:04.487 --> 00:32:05.924
Hmm.

389
00:32:09.144 --> 00:32:10.929
You wish to be alone.

390
00:32:11.973 --> 00:32:14.323
No.

391
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.716
I'm happy to be here.

392
00:32:15.803 --> 00:32:17.196
With you.

393
00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:20.895
England girls
do not make you happy?

394
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.767
It was I that made them unhappy.

395
00:32:25.204 --> 00:32:27.684
-Are you happy now?
-Yes.

396
00:32:27.771 --> 00:32:28.947
Because you want to lie with me?

397
00:32:29.034 --> 00:32:31.166
Yes. Uh. no!
I mean. what--

398
00:32:31.253 --> 00:32:33.777
I'm so sorry.
I-I-I didn't mean to say that.

399
00:32:33.864 --> 00:32:35.214
-Forgive me.
-

400
00:32:35.301 --> 00:32:36.563
You are funny.

401
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.478
Always know what to say.
but now. no.

402
00:32:38.565 --> 00:32:40.654
White tiger.

403
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.266
Come. drink with us.

404
00:32:46.573 --> 00:32:48.357
Go to them.

405
00:32:48.444 --> 00:32:49.793
But careful.

406
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.859
I thought you Musselmen
don't drink.

407
00:33:12.729 --> 00:33:14.122
Oh. Dayaks do.

408
00:33:15.384 --> 00:33:16.951
Chinese. too.

409
00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:23.305
-It's tuak.
-It's tuak?

410
00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:24.741
-Tuak.
-Tuak?

411
00:33:24.828 --> 00:33:27.005
-Rice wine.
-Mm. Good.

412
00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:30.356
And only this
they do together.

413
00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:32.880
Come...

414
00:33:43.412 --> 00:33:45.066
-Charley.
-Arthur.

415
00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:47.634
Just... careful.
It's strong.

416
00:33:48.983 --> 00:33:51.029
And thus. we rule.

417
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:04.259
It's a curious siege.

418
00:34:06.479 --> 00:34:08.959
More like a ballroom dance
than warfare.

419
00:34:11.353 --> 00:34:13.268
They come close...

420
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.445
and never touch.

421
00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:19.448
It's all just for show.

422
00:34:20.754 --> 00:34:22.625
But for whom?

423
00:34:25.237 --> 00:34:28.109
I feel I'm dancing to music
yet to be written.

424
00:34:29.023 --> 00:34:30.416
A tedious gavotte...

425
00:34:33.332 --> 00:34:36.857
that will end only if I step up
and take things in hand.

426
00:34:51.611 --> 00:34:54.092
I haven't properly thanked you
for saving my life.

427
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.616
It was my honor. prince.
Have a drink.

428
00:34:56.703 --> 00:34:58.618
It is forbidden.

429
00:34:58.705 --> 00:35:00.663
Though...

430
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.665
there are worse sins.

431
00:35:04.189 --> 00:35:05.581
Yes.

432
00:35:06.887 --> 00:35:08.889
Cowardice.

433
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:10.325
Careful.

434
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:17.115
There's more going on here
than meets the eye.

435
00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:19.552
You miss very little. do you?

436
00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:21.249
For a man who worked so hard

437
00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:23.817
to get me to attack the fort.

438
00:35:23.904 --> 00:35:26.211
Makota doesn't much
want me to take it.

439
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.084
Think. James.

440
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:32.478
Does he really
want you to win?

441
00:35:33.957 --> 00:35:35.481
What does he gain?

442
00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:41.661
If Makota wins this war...

443
00:35:43.053 --> 00:35:46.753
the Sultan might make him
Rajah of Sarawak.

444
00:35:48.102 --> 00:35:50.278
And that puts him
ahead of you

445
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:52.150
in line to be Sultan

446
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:54.064
when the old boy dies.

447
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:56.154
-But...
-But...

448
00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:59.157
Makota has to be seen

449
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:01.507
to be the general
that wins the war.

450
00:36:03.204 --> 00:36:04.901
Not me.

451
00:36:04.988 --> 00:36:07.339
And certainly not you.

452
00:36:07.426 --> 00:36:08.818
Yes.

453
00:36:10.298 --> 00:36:12.039
We use you.

454
00:36:12.126 --> 00:36:14.172
You use us.

455
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.567
The British love to play
the great game.

456
00:36:18.654 --> 00:36:22.789
but they never understand
that we are the kings

457
00:36:22.876 --> 00:36:24.791
and you are the pawns.

458
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:37.107
Except you.

459
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:39.458
You...

460
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:42.069
could be a king.

461
00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:03.133
This isn't a fort.

462
00:37:04.961 --> 00:37:07.050
It's a bloody refuge.

463
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.053
Allahu akbar!

464
00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:16.625
I had him in my sights.

465
00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:31.640
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

466
00:37:31.727 --> 00:37:33.860
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

467
00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:38.212
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

468
00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:40.345
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

469
00:37:42.347 --> 00:37:44.174
Makota lied to me.

470
00:37:45.698 --> 00:37:48.744
These rebels aren't protecting
the pirates.

471
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:52.531
They can't even
protect themselves.

472
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:03.803
Why do you come here.
to Sarawak?

473
00:38:05.892 --> 00:38:07.589
Escaping. I suppose.

474
00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:10.549
Looking for something.

475
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:20.428
So to you.
we are just an escape?

476
00:38:20.515 --> 00:38:21.821
James?

477
00:38:21.908 --> 00:38:23.344
Careful.

478
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:24.998
He loves you.

479
00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:33.876
Lord Bedruddin.

480
00:38:33.963 --> 00:38:36.357
Congratulations
on your victory.

481
00:38:38.011 --> 00:38:39.708
Hardly a victory. Sire.

482
00:38:39.795 --> 00:38:42.929
The rebels. the fort were not
what I expected.

483
00:38:44.452 --> 00:38:47.716
Now I see why this war
has dragged on for so long.

484
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:52.852
The nobles fight Makota
because he can't...

485
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.117
or won't protect them
from pirates.

486
00:38:57.204 --> 00:39:02.165
And I need someone I can trust
when I am Sultan.

487
00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:05.473
A White man from afar.

488
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.388
with ships and guns...

489
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.218
whom all factions can follow.

490
00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:14.308
That's absurd.

491
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.572
I'm just a traveler.

492
00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:20.053
So you keep saying. Jim.

493
00:39:21.446 --> 00:39:25.624
But there's gold
in Sarawak. Jim.

494
00:39:25.711 --> 00:39:29.192
Coal. and all the spices
your ship will carry.

495
00:39:31.064 --> 00:39:32.935
I don't care about gold.

496
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:42.467
Is it true what they say?

497
00:39:42.554 --> 00:39:45.121
You were shot in the heart.
yet lived?

498
00:39:46.035 --> 00:39:47.428
No.

499
00:39:49.169 --> 00:39:50.518
It was the lung.

500
00:39:53.956 --> 00:39:55.523
Better the heart.

501
00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:57.786
For Semingat.

502
00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:01.616
That Makota fears.
most of all.

503
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:06.491
I'm not the man
you think I am.

504
00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:13.628
Who of us is?

505
00:40:15.108 --> 00:40:16.762
Good night. Jim.

506
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:18.459
Good night. My Prince.

507
00:40:29.209 --> 00:40:30.819
These are for galley slaves.

508
00:40:30.906 --> 00:40:32.865
And these...

509
00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:36.477
These are for my harem.

510
00:40:36.564 --> 00:40:38.871
-Orang Kaya.
- Yeah?

511
00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:41.961
You may also take one head
for each son.

512
00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:43.441
and two for yourself.

513
00:40:43.528 --> 00:40:45.617
Now...

514
00:40:45.704 --> 00:40:47.662
-Allahu akbar!
-Wait!

515
00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:51.405
We had an agreement.

516
00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:54.016
But I'm a Prince.

517
00:40:54.974 --> 00:40:56.497
We make new agreement.

518
00:40:58.238 --> 00:40:59.979
Leave your cannon.
take your flag.

519
00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:01.415
and leave with your head.

520
00:41:03.852 --> 00:41:05.463
Makota. stop!

521
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:07.900
I insist.

522
00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:10.903
You cannot insist.
Englishman!

523
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.557
You do not rule here.

524
00:41:17.431 --> 00:41:19.389
Is this your decision. Tuan?

525
00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:25.091
Prince Bedruddin.

526
00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:27.528
you offered me Sarawak if I
defeated the rebels at the fort.

527
00:41:27.615 --> 00:41:30.313
-I accept.
-What are you talking about?

528
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.838
Sarawak is mine.

529
00:41:35.144 --> 00:41:36.668
Is it?

530
00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:01.214
Your love for this Englishman

531
00:42:01.301 --> 00:42:03.216
will be your death...

532
00:42:03.303 --> 00:42:04.652
cousin.

533
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:39.513
Ali's wives.

534
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.342
They do this so your virtue
may rub off on his village.

535
00:42:42.429 --> 00:42:44.779
A most sensible Dayak custom.

536
00:42:56.922 --> 00:42:59.664
Datu Patinggi Ali
thanks you for your mercy.

537
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:03.319
He paid Makota 20 pasus of rice
and ten slaves in tax.

538
00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:06.409
So how much more must he pay
in punishment

539
00:43:06.496 --> 00:43:07.672
for their rebellion?

540
00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:09.891
From now on. one pasu.

541
00:43:09.978 --> 00:43:12.764
One pasu is only a peck. Tuan.

542
00:43:12.851 --> 00:43:14.243
Nothing.

543
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:16.898
Patinggi Ali...

544
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:20.249
what is important to me

545
00:43:20.336 --> 00:43:23.601
is your friendship
and your loyalty.

546
00:43:25.037 --> 00:43:27.735
And there'll be no more
taking of slaves.

547
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:33.001
Datu Patinggi Ali--

548
00:43:33.088 --> 00:43:35.003
Datu Patinggi Ali thanks Allah
for sending you

549
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.136
like a bird from heaven.

550
00:43:37.223 --> 00:43:38.616
But he asks.

551
00:43:38.703 --> 00:43:41.357
is the Rajah
a bird of passage.

552
00:43:41.444 --> 00:43:45.361
who now flies home to make love
to his woman queen.

553
00:43:45.448 --> 00:43:46.972
get more ships and guns?

554
00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:50.671
Tell Ali my queen
has a husband...

555
00:43:51.803 --> 00:43:53.282
and the ship and guns
are mine.

556
00:43:53.369 --> 00:43:55.937
Still...

557
00:43:56.024 --> 00:43:58.244
once the Sultan of Brunei
makes you Rajah...

558
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.682
will you fly away?

559
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.119
Are you asking for him.

560
00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:05.643
or for you?

561
00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:09.951
You run even from
a question.

562
00:44:21.223 --> 00:44:22.921
Who would believe it.

563
00:44:23.008 --> 00:44:26.838
to be crowned king
by the Sultan of Brunei?

564
00:44:28.404 --> 00:44:31.669
The greatest empire
of spice islands in Asia.

565
00:44:31.756 --> 00:44:34.933
Certainly not my father.

566
00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.413
Nor anyone in England.

567
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.677
Certainly not myself.

568
00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:45.683
He who rules the world.

569
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.294
the Sultan Of Brunei...

570
00:44:48.381 --> 00:44:50.862
decrees the White Rajah.

571
00:44:50.949 --> 00:44:52.254
James Brooke.

572
00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:54.692
ruler of Sarawak.

573
00:44:57.477 --> 00:45:00.698
Obey him as you obey our Sultan.

574
00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:16.670
If any will contest this.

575
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:19.629
let them declare it now.
or forever be silent.

576
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:47.962
Stop!

577
00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:56.623
Now you must
split his skull.

578
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.843
Do it. to be their king.

579
00:46:08.374 --> 00:46:10.245
No.

580
00:46:10.332 --> 00:46:11.769
I won't rule like that.

581
00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:13.553
Rule?

582
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.860
Are you mad?
We don't belong here.

583
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.907
But I do.

584
00:46:23.258 --> 00:46:25.217
You do not rule here.

585
00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:30.613
You do not rule here.

586
00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:33.921
You do not rule here!

587
00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:53.636
You escaped the harem.

588
00:46:53.723 --> 00:46:55.725
Yes.

589
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:57.989
But not to join yours.

590
00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:13.569
So you say now.

591
00:47:13.656 --> 00:47:15.702
But once the mystery is gone?

592
00:47:17.312 --> 00:47:19.924
With you it's just one mystery
after another.

593
00:47:21.273 --> 00:47:22.622
Then another...

594
00:47:23.623 --> 00:47:25.016
and another...

595
00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:03.532
Subu?

596
00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:05.143
You must come. Quickly.

597
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.493
Uncle Arthur.
you don't mean that. sir.

598
00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.147
I most certainly do.
Now come along.

599
00:48:09.234 --> 00:48:11.410
-He needs us. You. most of all.
-He needs her.

600
00:48:11.497 --> 00:48:13.978
His bloody muse.
or some such rot.

601
00:48:14.065 --> 00:48:15.631
Where are you going. Arthur?

602
00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:28.688
Home.

603
00:48:29.558 --> 00:48:30.820
We're going home.

604
00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:32.474
This is home.

605
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:33.823
For you and your
native princess.

606
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.042
it may very well be.

607
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:36.609
But it's not home to me.

608
00:48:36.696 --> 00:48:38.393
It's no place for Charley.

609
00:48:39.525 --> 00:48:41.701
You try and
civilize them. and--

610
00:48:41.788 --> 00:48:43.964
Perhaps we can civilize him.

611
00:48:48.577 --> 00:48:51.537
This pretending to be king
is just too much.

612
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:54.670
This is where I get off.

613
00:48:55.628 --> 00:48:57.456
You can't have it both ways.

614
00:48:57.543 --> 00:48:59.371
You must choose.

615
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:01.155
Us...

616
00:49:01.242 --> 00:49:02.722
or them.

617
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:04.158
I have.

618
00:49:08.032 --> 00:49:10.121
What happens
if she has a child?

619
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:13.341
You'll just run away again?

620
00:49:14.864 --> 00:49:16.562
You should go now.

621
00:49:19.913 --> 00:49:22.307
-Uncle Arthur.
-Leave it. Leave it.

622
00:49:33.144 --> 00:49:34.972
Go. Charley.

623
00:49:37.713 --> 00:49:39.846
He just misses his wife. sir.

624
00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:41.717
Home.

625
00:50:00.127 --> 00:50:01.911
I was given a sword

626
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:06.090
to rule a kingdom
larger than England.

627
00:50:06.177 --> 00:50:08.527
But I have had enough
of killing.

628
00:50:12.183 --> 00:50:14.707
If I rule as the British do.

629
00:50:14.794 --> 00:50:18.580
I'd become the man I've spent
my life trying to escape.

630
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:20.800
But. Rajah.

631
00:50:20.887 --> 00:50:22.541
since you do not allow us
to take heads.

632
00:50:22.628 --> 00:50:24.760
how can I pay
for a second wife?

633
00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:27.154
Surely one wife
is enough for any man. Tujang.

634
00:50:27.241 --> 00:50:28.460
No.

635
00:50:28.547 --> 00:50:30.027
How can I have only one wife?

636
00:50:30.114 --> 00:50:32.333
Perhaps you can pay her in coin?

637
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.814
Subu. give them
two shillings.

638
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.301
-Pounds. then.
-This is not good business.

639
00:50:44.389 --> 00:50:45.651
I must unlearn

640
00:50:45.738 --> 00:50:48.436
everything that I think
I know.

641
00:50:49.742 --> 00:50:52.136
And embrace all that I do not.

642
00:50:56.662 --> 00:50:58.968
Start anew.

643
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:02.363
Build a natural utopia...

644
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.236
where we love all living
things equally.

645
00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:08.413
A case of murder
in the first degree.

646
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.762
Bring the accused.

647
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.948
But what do I do
when they kill each other?

648
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:36.441
I've finally found home.

649
00:51:38.704 --> 00:51:42.403
A family to embrace
this barefoot boy of Bengal...

650
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:45.798
who ran out his father's door

651
00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:47.234
into the jungle...

652
00:51:48.279 --> 00:51:50.063
to find someone
who will love me

653
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.326
as I am.

654
00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:10.605
- Rajah!

655
00:52:10.692 --> 00:52:13.086
Rajah! Rajah!

656
00:52:13.173 --> 00:52:14.740
-Rajah...
-Tujang.

657
00:52:14.827 --> 00:52:16.176
Look at this.

658
00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:17.612
Carnivorous pitcher plant.

659
00:52:17.699 --> 00:52:20.006
The Royal Society
calls it Nepenthes Rajah.

660
00:52:20.093 --> 00:52:22.139
I discovered it.

661
00:52:22.226 --> 00:52:23.923
Was it not here before?

662
00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:29.233
Must be the mail ship
from Singapore.

663
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.191
Is that Master Charley. Tuan?

664
00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:33.498
Spyglass.

665
00:52:41.332 --> 00:52:42.985
Midshipman Brooke. now.

666
00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:44.857
Let's open a bottle of wine.

667
00:52:48.034 --> 00:52:50.384
We heard you jumped ship
in Singapore. joined the Navy.

668
00:52:50.471 --> 00:52:52.865
Yes. sir. but I got leave
to come and give you the mail.

669
00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:54.214
-Charley.
-Good to see you.

670
00:52:54.301 --> 00:52:55.520
And you.

671
00:52:56.564 --> 00:52:57.913
Now. will you take a drink.

672
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.219
or has the Navy
not corrupted you yet?

673
00:52:59.306 --> 00:53:00.612
Oh. you know how it is. sir.

674
00:53:00.699 --> 00:53:02.091
Beer for breakfast.
grog at noon.

675
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:03.963
-wine and port for dinner.
-Good lord.

676
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.400
I'm surprised they could find
their way anywhere.

677
00:53:09.534 --> 00:53:10.926
-To the crown.
-

678
00:53:11.013 --> 00:53:12.493
Her Majesty's or yours. Rajah?

679
00:53:13.842 --> 00:53:15.409
Drink twice then.

680
00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:19.587
I suppose it's all a great joke
back in England.

681
00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:22.024
The China merchants in Singapore
don't seem to think so.

682
00:53:22.111 --> 00:53:23.591
They sent you this.

683
00:53:23.678 --> 00:53:25.114
Ah.

684
00:53:25.985 --> 00:53:27.160
At last.

685
00:53:28.466 --> 00:53:29.858
We'll use it tonight.

686
00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:32.905
There's talk of
a knighthood. sir.

687
00:53:32.992 --> 00:53:35.560
-For what?
-For making Borneo British. sir.

688
00:53:35.647 --> 00:53:38.432
The French want Sarawak too.
and the Dutch.

689
00:53:38.519 --> 00:53:40.956
Which. of course. makes
Parliament want us even more.

690
00:53:41.783 --> 00:53:43.002
Ah.

691
00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:44.264
The lantern goes inside.

692
00:53:44.351 --> 00:53:45.874
Here. read this.

693
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:48.355
"The President
of the United States

694
00:53:48.442 --> 00:53:50.575
invites you to America
to sign a treaty

695
00:53:50.662 --> 00:53:54.187
recognizing you as Rajah
of an independent Sarawak."

696
00:53:54.274 --> 00:53:55.841
And there's this.

697
00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:58.800
"A romantic adventurer
like Lord Byron.

698
00:53:58.887 --> 00:54:01.542
Ladies sleep with his cameo
in their bosom."

699
00:54:01.629 --> 00:54:03.327
The Dayaks will love this.

700
00:54:03.414 --> 00:54:06.591
And that's a marriage proposal
from Angela Coutts.

701
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.593
Coutts Bank.

702
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.334
She's the richest woman
in England. sir.

703
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:11.900
Charley...

704
00:54:14.338 --> 00:54:17.732
we don't need England.
or America.

705
00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:19.691
or Coutts bank.

706
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.868
You see...

707
00:54:22.955 --> 00:54:24.435
I'm as rich as I can be.

708
00:54:26.437 --> 00:54:28.395
Yes. sir. she's very beautiful.

709
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:30.702
Yes.

710
00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:33.966
And you don't know
the half of it. Charley.

711
00:54:34.053 --> 00:54:35.794
She knows everything.

712
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:39.493
Dayak culture.
monsoon weather.

713
00:54:40.364 --> 00:54:42.061
You see...

714
00:54:42.148 --> 00:54:43.845
I'm in love.

715
00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:48.241
With the country. sir.
or with her?

716
00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:52.419
Drink twice then.

717
00:55:14.746 --> 00:55:17.009
Again. Rajah. Again.

718
00:55:17.096 --> 00:55:18.619
What is this. sir?

719
00:55:19.707 --> 00:55:21.143
Chicken's feet. Charley.

720
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:23.624
-Chicken's feet?
-It's a Chinese delicacy.

721
00:55:27.628 --> 00:55:29.195
Oh...

722
00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:34.679
In Singapore. Uncle Arthur
made me eat a bull's...

723
00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:37.290
manhood.

724
00:55:40.946 --> 00:55:43.165
He said it's supposed
to help. you know. in...

725
00:55:47.474 --> 00:55:48.867
Don't worry.

726
00:55:51.522 --> 00:55:52.784
How is Uncle Arthur?

727
00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:54.699
-To Uncle Arthur.
-To Uncle Arthur.

728
00:55:54.786 --> 00:55:58.572
He sends his regards. sir.
He said... he said.

729
00:55:58.659 --> 00:56:00.618
it's supposed to help you rise
to the occasion.

730
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:00.286
A message. they said.

731
00:57:00.373 --> 00:57:02.157
Snake People.
they've come to haunt us.

732
00:57:02.244 --> 00:57:04.551
They swim up from the sea
to eat us.

733
00:57:04.638 --> 00:57:06.814
like ghosts
with poison teeth.

734
00:57:07.902 --> 00:57:09.251
Snake People?

735
00:57:09.338 --> 00:57:11.123
They are Lanun Pirates.

736
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:12.559
The rest is just myth.

737
00:57:12.646 --> 00:57:15.083
James. Life. Myth.

738
00:57:15.867 --> 00:57:17.521
It is all one.

739
00:57:17.608 --> 00:57:20.524
We can't row cannon upriver
until the dry season.

740
00:57:24.397 --> 00:57:27.618
I'm going to send a scout.
See if he can find anything.

741
00:57:39.847 --> 00:57:42.502
I feel Makota's presence
behind this.

742
00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.507
I sense his desperation...

743
00:57:49.727 --> 00:57:52.033
building like a monsoon.

744
00:58:19.191 --> 00:58:21.933
And he won't go to bed
until he has seen them all.

745
00:58:23.369 --> 00:58:25.284
Incredible.

746
00:58:25.371 --> 00:58:28.069
A man you'd follow
to the ends of the earth.

747
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.376
So did you.

748
00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:33.292
And Colonel Crookshank.

749
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:48.829
Poor bastard.

750
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.832
I sent him to scout the Lanun.

751
00:58:51.919 --> 00:58:53.834
They took his fingers.

752
00:58:54.792 --> 00:58:55.967
It's Makota.

753
00:58:56.054 --> 00:58:57.621
I'm to blame.

754
00:59:00.711 --> 00:59:03.670
Is there anything I can do
to help. sir?

755
00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:05.542
The Sarawak River.

756
00:59:10.634 --> 00:59:11.983
Where we stand.

757
00:59:12.984 --> 00:59:14.246
Where Makota and the Lanun

758
00:59:14.333 --> 00:59:16.117
are attacking the Dayaks.

759
00:59:16.204 --> 00:59:18.946
In monsoon. the river runs
so fast. it'll drown crocodiles.

760
00:59:20.295 --> 00:59:22.471
We can't get up there
without a steamship.

761
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:26.084
I was thinking you might ask
the Navy for one.

762
00:59:26.171 --> 00:59:28.042
I'm just a midshipman
on leave. sir.

763
00:59:28.129 --> 00:59:31.306
And. well. they're not
quite pirates. are they?

764
00:59:31.393 --> 00:59:33.178
Not in the Admiralty sense.

765
00:59:33.265 --> 00:59:36.050
Not out at sea.
preying on British interests.

766
00:59:36.137 --> 00:59:37.791
But I am British.

767
00:59:37.878 --> 00:59:39.488
You've seen what the Lanun do.

768
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:41.055
You've been to a village.

769
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:49.890
Your music's beautiful. Miss.

770
00:59:49.977 --> 00:59:52.153
It's very sad.

771
00:59:57.115 --> 00:59:58.682
I suppose I could ask
Captain Beech

772
00:59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.684
to bring his steamship
from Singapore.

773
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:03.600
But why would the Royal Navy
care about Borneo?

774
01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:06.994
Coal.

775
01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:10.258
Madame Lim's Hakka miners
have been hauling it up like mad

776
01:00:10.345 --> 01:00:14.262
from Labuan island
all the way upriver.

777
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:17.135
And the British empire
needs coaling stations.

778
01:00:17.222 --> 01:00:19.659
So we ask them to chart
the rivers of Sarawak

779
01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.269
for a coaling station.

780
01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:22.880
That just might work.

781
01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.406
A steamship. you say?
For Borneo?

782
01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:29.408
To chart the rivers
for a coaling station.

783
01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:30.931
They're impassable
in the monsoon.

784
01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:33.368
So why not wait
until the dry season?

785
01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:38.025
Well. sir. there...

786
01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:40.158
there's also the--

787
01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:41.550
Yes. out with it. boy.

788
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.335
There's...

789
01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:45.119
the Snake People.

790
01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:46.773
The Lanun.

791
01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:51.343
This is your uncle talking. yes?

792
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.214
There have been questions
in Parliament.

793
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.434
Talk of an inquiry.

794
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:58.611
He's not quite the thing. is he?

795
01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.091
I do read the London papers.
you know.

796
01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:01.788
as well as my orders.

797
01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:04.095
And there is nothing in them
about Snake People.

798
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:05.662
But they're pirates. sir.

799
01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.925
and they're preying
on British interests.

800
01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:09.796
And. pray tell.

801
01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:13.495
what interest has Britain
in strengthening your Rajah

802
01:01:13.582 --> 01:01:15.715
if Sarawak is not part
of the Empire?

803
01:01:17.543 --> 01:01:19.240
Well. sir. he's...

804
01:01:19.327 --> 01:01:21.242
He's British.

805
01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:24.593
So you want me

806
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.857
to take Nemesis.

807
01:01:26.944 --> 01:01:29.555
the most powerful steamship
on earth.

808
01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:32.689
up some jungle river
to fight Snake People?

809
01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:36.040
The Rajah would be
very grateful.

810
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:38.825
Gratitude be damned. boy.

811
01:01:38.912 --> 01:01:40.914
We want his coal
and his colony.

812
01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:44.178
So just how badly
does Brooke need our help?

813
01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:46.354
Well. sir. I...

814
01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:53.492
I think you should go
and ask him.

815
01:01:54.623 --> 01:01:55.973
Wake up. Rajah.

816
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.539
-

817
01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.790
They were here.

818
01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.835
Rajah?

819
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.272
Subu?

820
01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:19.926
Tuan.

821
01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:32.373
Tujang. Where's Tujang?

822
01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:35.115
Subu. where is Tujang?

823
01:03:35.202 --> 01:03:36.813
I don't know.

824
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.554
Tujang! Tujang!

825
01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:38.048
Divides the living
from the dead.

826
01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:50.887
No!

827
01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:55.108
I will not leave.

828
01:04:57.284 --> 01:05:00.113
You said Tujang
is no longer with you.

829
01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:02.507
But he's here.

830
01:05:02.594 --> 01:05:03.943
With me.

831
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:11.603
Tujang had a fire inside of him.

832
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:15.912
In my dreams he speaks to me.

833
01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:19.524
"To have peace.

834
01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.352
we must make war."

835
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.227
This is war!

836
01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:02.523
God bless England.

837
01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.876
Boarders at the rails.

838
01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:27.505
Sir Edward.
we are honored.

839
01:06:27.592 --> 01:06:29.986
-The pleasure's ours. Brooke.
-Thank you.

840
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.728
Charley.

841
01:06:33.815 --> 01:06:35.208
With a steamship.
as ordered.

842
01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:37.080
Just in time. Bless you.

843
01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:40.735
Crook.

844
01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:45.436
Come here. cousin.

845
01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:47.916
Oh! You're back.

846
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.222
I missed you.

847
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.313
And with Elizabeth.

848
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.923
Yes. With me.

849
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.751
Mrs. Crookshank.
if you don't mind.

850
01:06:57.709 --> 01:06:59.450
I do beg your pardon.

851
01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:01.147
Mrs. Crookshank.

852
01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:03.106
Is this your
harem slave. James?

853
01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:05.325
Do tell her
to take my wrap. dear.

854
01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.982
We have no slaves in Sarawak.

855
01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:13.290
Fatima is my love.

856
01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:15.553
Say. Brooke.
can we get a drink.

857
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.511
or have you gone
all Mohammedan on us?

858
01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.123
Yes. a drink. Why not?
Let's break the ice a little.

859
01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.429
Does she speak at all?

860
01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:24.301
Only to my equals.

861
01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:32.483
We're going to need
a lot more whisky. Charley.

862
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:33.527
Yes. sir.

863
01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:35.051
To Sir Edward Beech.

864
01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:37.749
Captain of the Nemesis.

865
01:07:37.836 --> 01:07:39.707
The leaders of Sarawak.

866
01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:42.971
I think we've met before.
Sir Edward.

867
01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.712
Yes. yes.

868
01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:46.932
Well. it's a wonderful place
you have. Brooke.

869
01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.760
but we're all rather hungry.

870
01:07:48.847 --> 01:07:50.762
Could you get your niggers
to serve us some dinner. eh?

871
01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:53.808
Of course.

872
01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:57.508
Well. I have
a little announcement.

873
01:07:57.595 --> 01:07:59.814
In reward for his exploits

874
01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:03.992
in what is to be
our latest crown colony...

875
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.300
I am to carry Mr. Brooke
to Windsor.

876
01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:11.261
where he shall be invested
by Her Majesty. Queen Victoria.

877
01:08:11.348 --> 01:08:14.351
as a Knight Commander
of the Bath.

878
01:08:18.224 --> 01:08:19.747
Here's to...

879
01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:22.402
Sir James Brooke. KCB.

880
01:08:22.489 --> 01:08:25.449
Speech. Speech.
- Yes. speech. indeed.

881
01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:28.365
I thank Sir Edward
for the honor.

882
01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:30.410
But I can't go home with you.

883
01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:32.108
Because. as you see.

884
01:08:32.195 --> 01:08:34.110
I am home.

885
01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:37.069
Sarawak is a sovereign nation...

886
01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:38.723
that I rule...

887
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.334
with the blessings
of its people.

888
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:42.988
Sovereign nation?

889
01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:44.816
But I'm offering you...

890
01:08:44.903 --> 01:08:46.557
Crookshank. talk to him.

891
01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:50.561
Sir Edward. the Rajah is greatly
honored by your visit.

892
01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:52.302
and by your gift
of your great steamship

893
01:08:52.389 --> 01:08:54.434
to help us fight
the Lanun Pirates.

894
01:08:54.521 --> 01:08:56.001
Lanun? I'm here for coal

895
01:08:56.088 --> 01:08:57.872
and to take possession
of a crown colony.

896
01:08:57.959 --> 01:09:00.223
You've consumed
half the earth. Sir Edward.

897
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.963
A feast of colonies.

898
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:04.531
Surely you cannot
thirst for more.

899
01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:06.359
And in any case. I'm afraid.

900
01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:09.014
Sarawak cannot become
your colony

901
01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:11.364
until the Rajah declares it so.

902
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.887
He has narimba.

903
01:09:12.974 --> 01:09:14.454
Yes. narimba.

904
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.326
A Rajah's right to dispose
of his country.

905
01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:18.676
Rajah? Narimba?

906
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:21.940
Nonsense.
If I chose.

907
01:09:22.027 --> 01:09:24.116
I could destroy your fairy-tale
country in a week

908
01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.465
with the Nemesis.

909
01:09:25.552 --> 01:09:27.206
And why would you want
to do that

910
01:09:27.293 --> 01:09:29.643
when you already have
an Englishman on the throne?

911
01:09:41.002 --> 01:09:43.135
What is that horrid smell?

912
01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.796
Come along. come along.

913
01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:53.058
Outside. Outside.

914
01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:54.625
No.

915
01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:57.062
The Rajah hasn't seen them yet.

916
01:09:58.716 --> 01:10:00.108
Surely. Sir James.

917
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.240
you must have
at least one evening

918
01:10:01.327 --> 01:10:02.807
with your own kind.

919
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.027
Madame. they are
my honored guests.

920
01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:08.726
Oh. the princes.
to be sure.

921
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:11.816
Now. shoo.

922
01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.426
Mrs. Crookshank!

923
01:10:16.386 --> 01:10:20.303
You are new here.
and most welcome.

924
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.653
But I do insist
you show respect.

925
01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:27.527
Ladies. I believe
this is our cue now.

926
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:31.357
-Englishmen and their port.
-Really. Arthur.

927
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.494
You knew.

928
01:10:39.931 --> 01:10:41.759
They brought you out here
to twist my arm.

929
01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:43.151
How could you. Arthur?

930
01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.502
It's time. Jim.
It's for the best.

931
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.637
No. it's not.

932
01:10:50.724 --> 01:10:52.117
You know what things were like
before I came.

933
01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:53.858
And what's changed?

934
01:10:53.945 --> 01:10:56.252
Headhunters.
pirates. slavers.

935
01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:58.471
And they'll be here
long after you've gone.

936
01:10:58.558 --> 01:11:01.300
You've gone broke trying
to save these people. Jim.

937
01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:03.476
Come home.

938
01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:05.739
Marry a rich widow.
Get knighted by the queen.

939
01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.481
Let England worry
about Sarawak.

940
01:11:13.573 --> 01:11:15.358
So that's it?

941
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:19.623
The scheme you've cooked up
with your fellows at the club?

942
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:22.452
He's gone mad. the poor bastard.
he's gone native.

943
01:11:22.539 --> 01:11:24.628
Bring him back to England.
marry him. knight him.

944
01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:26.804
and then we'll have
another colony.

945
01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:40.905
I'm not mad.

946
01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:49.522
No.

947
01:11:49.609 --> 01:11:51.350
You're just different.

948
01:12:23.774 --> 01:12:25.297
We should let him
think about it.

949
01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:26.864
I'm going with him.

950
01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:28.779
Why?

951
01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:30.955
She's the one.
The one you left.

952
01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:35.089
I don't care about her.
I love you.

953
01:12:36.613 --> 01:12:38.571
They humiliated me.

954
01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:45.752
I gave myself to you.

955
01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:47.798
All of me.

956
01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:49.234
Fatima...

957
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:53.412
please come back inside.

958
01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:56.241
I can never be English.

959
01:12:57.198 --> 01:12:59.113
I don't want you to be.

960
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.593
I just want you.

961
01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.379
You're one of them.

962
01:13:04.771 --> 01:13:06.904
You cannot run
from who you are.

963
01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.126
Fatima.

964
01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:04.222
What will you do now. Rajah?

965
01:14:04.309 --> 01:14:06.006
Go to bed.

966
01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:08.748
I have a fever.

967
01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:13.536
I think Fatima
is waiting for you.

968
01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:15.276
No.

969
01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:17.278
She went to Lundu.

970
01:14:17.365 --> 01:14:20.804
She's upset.

971
01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:23.284
This comes of treating her
like an Englishwoman. Jim.

972
01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:26.244
A Malay wife would not
have been at the table.

973
01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:28.115
The Lanun will attack soon.

974
01:14:28.202 --> 01:14:30.466
They have arms. boats. gold.

975
01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.816
and Makota to lead them.

976
01:14:32.903 --> 01:14:36.515
Why not let this detestable
Sir Edward woo you a little?

977
01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:40.258
Give England an island
full of coal and fever.

978
01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:43.261
Like Labuan.

979
01:14:43.348 --> 01:14:45.829
A small price for
a steamship. Jim.

980
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.180
You don't know them.

981
01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:51.791
England.

982
01:14:51.878 --> 01:14:53.880
The Empire.

983
01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:57.493
They don't want some of you.

984
01:14:58.624 --> 01:15:00.800
England devours
all of you.

985
01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:04.412
I was born in India.

986
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.937
I've seen it firsthand.

987
01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:09.853
Better that than Lanun.

988
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.073
Kill the snake once
and for all. now.

989
01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.206
Or leave.

990
01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:17.164
But you must decide.

991
01:15:19.036 --> 01:15:20.733
So. what do you choose?

992
01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.214
I choose Sarawak.

993
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.086
Fatima.

994
01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:29.046
You.

995
01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:36.357
Firelight dancing
on the river.

996
01:15:36.444 --> 01:15:40.623
The sound of Malay voices
singing in my dreams.

997
01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.583
All of it.

998
01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.546
Yes.

999
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.200
Definitely a fever.

1000
01:15:56.769 --> 01:15:58.466
Good night.

1001
01:16:05.778 --> 01:16:07.867
Ahoy. Chinamen! Chinamen!

1002
01:16:21.228 --> 01:16:22.795
It's all just happening.

1003
01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:25.581
I can't seem to stop it.

1004
01:16:27.713 --> 01:16:29.236
Jim. look at me.

1005
01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:32.892
You're not well.

1006
01:16:34.198 --> 01:16:36.069
Come on.

1007
01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:14.053
Honestly. fireworks at
this time of night?

1008
01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.402
Elizabeth. we're under attack.

1009
01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:16.926
-What?
-You have to hide.

1010
01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:25.151
-You can't leave me.
-I have got to find Jim. Come.

1011
01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:27.327
-Ridiculous. I can't--
-He needs me. The cannon.

1012
01:19:27.414 --> 01:19:29.677
-Come on. get in.
-What am I supposed to do?

1013
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.070
Elizabeth. I'll come for you.

1014
01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:33.072
You must go to James.

1015
01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:36.946
Tell the Rajah
that my last thoughts

1016
01:19:37.033 --> 01:19:39.339
were of my love for him.

1017
01:19:39.426 --> 01:19:41.646
Here. go.

1018
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.780
I'll come back.

1019
01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:14.766
Jim! The guns!
Where are they?

1020
01:20:15.985 --> 01:20:17.856
Jim! Jim!

1021
01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:19.510
The guns!

1022
01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:21.164
Arthur?

1023
01:20:22.426 --> 01:20:24.167
You're back in England.

1024
01:20:24.254 --> 01:20:26.082
With Elizabeth.

1025
01:20:27.605 --> 01:20:29.737
Jim. snap to it.

1026
01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.130
The guns. man!
Where are they?

1027
01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:32.784
Jim. the guns.

1028
01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.668
This is all Makota's doing.

1029
01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:50.889
I've got a pistol
inside the house.

1030
01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:53.022
No. no. no. Jim...

1031
01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:56.852
Jim.

1032
01:21:23.835 --> 01:21:26.185
Subu! Over here!

1033
01:21:28.144 --> 01:21:29.623
So...

1034
01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:31.799
Brooke's got into some
native squabble. eh?

1035
01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.410
We've got to hurry.

1036
01:21:33.497 --> 01:21:36.065
Oh. do sit down. Lieutenant.
You look a mess.

1037
01:21:36.152 --> 01:21:37.936
With respect. sir.
there's no time.

1038
01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:40.243
We've got to take the Nemesis
upriver to save them.

1039
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.722
Hmm.

1040
01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:52.864
Her Majesty's steamships are not
for haring around the jungle.

1041
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:54.561
But they're English. sir.

1042
01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:56.607
Sir James. the Crookshanks.
Women and children.

1043
01:21:56.694 --> 01:21:58.130
And the Dayaks.

1044
01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:00.219
Do you know what the Lanun
will do to them?

1045
01:22:00.306 --> 01:22:02.439
I am sorry for the Crookshanks.

1046
01:22:02.526 --> 01:22:04.136
but that's on Brooke.

1047
01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:06.573
As for Dayaks and Lanun.

1048
01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.575
one native's
as much as another.

1049
01:22:09.707 --> 01:22:12.188
-Sir. I have to insist--
-No.

1050
01:22:12.275 --> 01:22:14.407
The Nemesis
shall remain here.

1051
01:22:14.494 --> 01:22:15.931
We'll let them kill each other.

1052
01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:17.933
and then come in and pick up
the pieces.

1053
01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:21.414
Sir. I respectfully request
to go upriver

1054
01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:23.242
to pick up any survivors.

1055
01:22:24.374 --> 01:22:26.158
As you wish.

1056
01:22:26.245 --> 01:22:29.074
But not as the Navy.
You're on your own.

1057
01:22:30.423 --> 01:22:31.511
I say. I'm out of bacon.

1058
01:22:31.598 --> 01:22:32.991
Boy.

1059
01:22:45.482 --> 01:22:49.138
Now. I am your Rajah.

1060
01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:53.838
No more English
to steal our land...

1061
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.016
to rob our coal for the Navy.

1062
01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:06.198
Take away our gold

1063
01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:09.462
so their fine women

1064
01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:13.031
can have shiny things
in their ears

1065
01:23:13.118 --> 01:23:16.078
as they shoo out the niggers.

1066
01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:18.732
Where are your earrings now?

1067
01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:20.299
Get away from her.

1068
01:23:20.386 --> 01:23:21.474
You're mad.

1069
01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:23.085
I'm not mad.

1070
01:23:24.477 --> 01:23:26.914
-I'm a patriot.
- Patriot?

1071
01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.613
-Wait till Brooke comes back.
- He's here.

1072
01:23:30.831 --> 01:23:33.399
There's your white Rajah.

1073
01:23:46.586 --> 01:23:48.414
Ahoy!

1074
01:23:50.329 --> 01:23:52.331
Is anybody out there?

1075
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:02.298
Ahoy!

1076
01:24:05.388 --> 01:24:07.520
Subu. Subu. portside.

1077
01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:15.180
-Charley.
- It's me.

1078
01:24:16.573 --> 01:24:18.314
You're okay.

1079
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:19.924
Lift him.

1080
01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:29.238
It's all right.

1081
01:24:29.325 --> 01:24:30.761
Hey. hey.

1082
01:24:30.848 --> 01:24:32.806
Lift him. Lift him.

1083
01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:34.895
Are you okay?

1084
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.690
Tuan.

1085
01:24:48.866 --> 01:24:50.868
He said to say
he loved you.

1086
01:25:13.238 --> 01:25:14.892
Elizabeth? Elizabeth?

1087
01:25:14.979 --> 01:25:16.807
They realized
you were alive.

1088
01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:19.201
they took all the prisoners
and left for Brunei.

1089
01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:21.159
Disappeared like ghosts.

1090
01:25:21.246 --> 01:25:22.595
Like ghosts.

1091
01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.033
We didn't pass them
coming upriver.

1092
01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:27.861
They'll head east
through the mangrove.

1093
01:25:27.948 --> 01:25:29.385
We can catch them if we hurry.

1094
01:25:31.387 --> 01:25:32.910
Sir?

1095
01:25:46.489 --> 01:25:47.925
Sir...

1096
01:26:31.447 --> 01:26:33.449
It's all my fault.

1097
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.974
It's too dangerous.

1098
01:26:39.019 --> 01:26:41.283
We've got to get you home.

1099
01:27:43.736 --> 01:27:45.651
It was Tujang's.

1100
01:27:51.396 --> 01:27:53.616
You can't run from this. James.

1101
01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:56.967
She's right. sir. Look.

1102
01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:48.192
I thought I was dead.

1103
01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:50.934
Leaving my past behind.

1104
01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:56.156
Instead. it was those I loved
who died.

1105
01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.899
And I have left them.

1106
01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:05.688
I see it clearly now.

1107
01:29:05.775 --> 01:29:09.344
I never needed a steamship
to find Makota.

1108
01:29:12.782 --> 01:29:14.653
He came to me.

1109
01:29:18.265 --> 01:29:21.356
He was always coming to me.

1110
01:29:47.512 --> 01:29:49.775
Malay guards.

1111
01:30:00.525 --> 01:30:02.397
Makota's men.

1112
01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:04.311
The Lanun caught them stealing.

1113
01:30:06.923 --> 01:30:09.099
Makota thinks
he can control them.

1114
01:30:10.883 --> 01:30:12.885
Lanun care only for the Lanun.

1115
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.153
They're over there. listen.
in the cove.

1116
01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:26.377
Let's get the Royalist.

1117
01:30:26.464 --> 01:30:27.987
We can anchor up
beyond the reef.

1118
01:30:28.074 --> 01:30:29.598
in cannon range.

1119
01:30:29.685 --> 01:30:31.948
No.

1120
01:30:32.035 --> 01:30:33.471
It's too bright.

1121
01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:35.865
Later.

1122
01:30:47.529 --> 01:30:48.965
I see him...

1123
01:30:50.096 --> 01:30:53.056
out there alone
with the Lanun.

1124
01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:56.668
Fighting over the spoils.

1125
01:30:57.756 --> 01:31:00.150
Once they devour the prisoners.

1126
01:31:00.237 --> 01:31:03.327
they'll fall on him
like ravening beasts.

1127
01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:20.475
I've been living in a fantasy
of my own making.

1128
01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:25.871
To rule the jungle.
I must love the jungle.

1129
01:31:26.785 --> 01:31:28.178
All of it.

1130
01:31:30.006 --> 01:31:31.747
The beauty...

1131
01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:35.968
and the blood.

1132
01:31:38.144 --> 01:31:41.017
He's not waiting for me
to kill him.

1133
01:31:42.888 --> 01:31:45.456
He's waiting for me
to save him.

1134
01:33:02.446 --> 01:33:06.581
Too weak to kill.
Too weak to rule.

1135
01:33:25.817 --> 01:33:28.037
I surrender.

1136
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:31.693
Mercy.

1137
01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:34.086
Please. Please.

1138
01:33:35.697 --> 01:33:37.960
Mercy.

1139
01:33:39.309 --> 01:33:40.919
Please.

1140
01:33:42.704 --> 01:33:44.314
No! No!

1141
01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.363
And so I am ruined...

1142
01:35:18.451 --> 01:35:19.888
but free.

1143
01:35:22.586 --> 01:35:25.023
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!

1144
01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:27.896
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!

1145
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:52.224
I'm not ready. sir.

1146
01:35:53.443 --> 01:35:55.837
You're the boy
I used to be. Charley.

1147
01:35:58.274 --> 01:36:00.232
I'd rather be the man
you are now.

1148
01:36:02.495 --> 01:36:03.932
No.

1149
01:36:04.019 --> 01:36:05.934
You don't want that.

1150
01:36:06.021 --> 01:36:09.328
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!

1151
01:36:09.415 --> 01:36:13.158
Rajah! Rajah!
Rajah! Rajah!

1152
01:36:13.245 --> 01:36:16.248
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!
