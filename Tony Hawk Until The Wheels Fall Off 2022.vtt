3
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.802
Damn it.

4
00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.169
Fuck!

5
00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.463
Fuck!

6
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:14.319
I'm willing to struggle
through the learning process.

7
00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.571
even change my approach

8
00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.448
just to figure out
how to do it.

9
00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.372
I never want to back down
from a challenge.

10
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:36.007
If you're convinced
that you're going to fail.

11
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.009
that will come to fruition.

12
00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:58.655
I was willing to get hurt
along the way.

13
00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:02.241
but I didn't visualize myself
getting hurt along the way.

14
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.959
I always approached it like.
"This is going to work."

15
00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.213
"I'm going
to figure this out."

16
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.682
My mom used to like
to tell the story

17
00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:10.560
that when she would
play tennis with me.

18
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:14.397
I would purposely just try
to hit her with the balls.

19
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.694
She scolded me at one point.

20
00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:20.695
She's like.

21
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.656
"I think you're trying
to hit me. Tony.

22
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.866
"I'm not going to play
with you

23
00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.909
if you're just trying
to hurt me."

24
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.373
I don't know
what my disorder was.

25
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:36.252
but I was
definitely difficult.

26
00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.087
I was determined
to have my way

27
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.216
to the point of being
very combative.

28
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.471
My mom would say that I was--

29
00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.639
she just said
I was very determined.

30
00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.644
I was really young.

31
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.731
but I remember my mom was
so frustrated with me

32
00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.066
'cause I just wouldn't do
what she said.

33
00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.026
I wanted to do something.
I wanted to do something else.

34
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.904
I--and she finally just said.

35
00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:06.032
"If you don't
stop being difficult.

36
00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.159
I'm going to flush myself
down the toilet."

37
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:11.287
I didn't believe it.
I didn't care. I didn't quit.

38
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.917
and she went in the bathroom
and flushed the toilet and hid.

39
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.295
She watched me lean over.
the toilet is swirling. going.

40
00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.923
"My mommy!"

41
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.646
- I think she is
in the beauty parlor.

42
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.855
- Oh. really?

43
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.023
both: Hi.

44
00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:43.152
- I'm gonna pull her out
whenever she's done.

45
00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.278
- Okay.

46
00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.279
- All right. thank you.

47
00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.781
- Thank you.
Bye-bye.

48
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.922
- Hi. Mom.

49
00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:04.382
Hi. Mom. it's Tony.

50
00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:06.050
How are you?

51
00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.181
How have you been?
You look good.

52
00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.225
I leave for Montreal next week

53
00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:16.435
for another one
of those skate contests.

54
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:22.108
Keegan is turning 18
in a couple weeks...

55
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.821
Which is
a frightening prospect.

56
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.906
And then once Calvin is out.
we only have Kady.

57
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.492
It's gonna be crazy.

58
00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.660
But I guess by that time.

59
00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:33.911
the older kids will move
back in.

60
00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.538
Isn't that what they do?

61
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.085
Maybe not.
Your kids didn't.

62
00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.883
'Cause you taught us
to be independent.

63
00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.103
It was always a big deal

64
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.522
that my mom was 43
when she had me.

65
00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:04.859
People would say.

66
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.402
"Oh. she's much older."
you know?

67
00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:08.988
And. "There are lots of risks
involved."

68
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.365
- Tony and I are
20 years apart.

69
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.700
I was a junior in college

70
00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:15.244
when my mom told me
she was pregnant.

71
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.538
- I was a senior
in high school.

72
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.375
All of Tony's siblings.
including me. we're older.

73
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.086
- I'm 12 1/2 years older
than Tony.

74
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.838
so when he was young.
especially.

75
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.759
our relationship
was almost as much...

76
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.761
paternal as fraternal.

77
00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.763
- I was basically
an only child.

78
00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:38.059
and my parents were old enough
to be my grandparents.

79
00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:41.395
- He was stuck at home
with my mom and dad

80
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.065
at a time when their marriage
wasn't so great.

81
00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:45.900
- My dad wasn't working a lot.

82
00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:48.152
He had been retired
from the Navy

83
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.113
and kind of finding his way.

84
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.323
- My brother was a surfer.

85
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.785
He drove him. you know.
dawn patrol to get the waves.

86
00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.370
My sister was a singer.

87
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.622
He was hauling
all their band gear.

88
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:03.209
He was the coach
of our baseball team.

89
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.088
The first time I ever
went to bat in Little League.

90
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.006
I was probably
about eight or nine.

91
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.550
I knew I was gonna hit it.
I was gonna get a home run.

92
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.802
Failure was not an option.

93
00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:15.596
I didn't even consider what
would happen if I struck out.

94
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.306
And then I remember
striking out

95
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.308
and thinking
the world had ended.

96
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.606
I always felt
a little misplaced

97
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.109
in all of those sports.

98
00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.944
I couldn't do
the physical things

99
00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:31.279
that most of my peers could do

100
00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.656
because they were bigger
and they were stronger.

101
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.450
and so I was always
just feeling uncomfortable

102
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.662
and kind of disappointed
in myself.

103
00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.456
- People would say.
"Oh. you have adult children.

104
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.750
and you have--
and you have Tony?"

105
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.837
She goes. "Yeah.
he's our little mistake."

106
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.008
- I really do think
that that played a role

107
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:56.554
in his. um...his psyche.

108
00:09:56.637 --> 00:09:59.348
That she would have had
an abortion if she could have

109
00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.641
in some ways. I think.

110
00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:04.020
maybe made him want
to prove himself.

111
00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.230
- Bye. Mom. I love you.
We'll see you soon. okay?

112
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.820
- Thanks for the visit.
Enjoy your lunch.

113
00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:19.035
Do you see me now?

114
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:35.051
My mom was always careful
with her words.

115
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.677
always positive.

116
00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.387
And then. I think. one day.

117
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.222
I was just pushing her buttons.

118
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.641
and she's like. "You know.
you're just full of it.

119
00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.435
You're just full of it. Tony.
Full of it."

120
00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:46.687
I'm like. "What?"
She goes. "You're full of...

121
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.980
"shit.

122
00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.065
You're full of shit."

123
00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.858
And I was like...

124
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.736
- Tony was a bit of a dick
when he was little.

125
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.696
Stubborn as fuck.

126
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.656
He and my dad
would bicker like crazy.

127
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.158
I got along
with Tony way better

128
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.701
when it was just
the two of us.

129
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.244
So I would often go off--
we'd go off.

130
00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.954
go to the beach
or go someplace.

131
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.582
- And I remember
he and his friend were skating

132
00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.542
in the alleyway.

133
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.086
and there was
another skateboard.

134
00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.505
this older one
that was just sitting there.

135
00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:15.007
and I said.
"Well. can I try that one?"

136
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.094
I just was going down
the alley.

137
00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.262
yelling back. "How do I turn?
How do I turn?"

138
00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.098
And then I eventually
ran into the fence.

139
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.599
It wasn't like the skies parted

140
00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.559
and there was
some great revelation.

141
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:28.646
It was more like.
"Oh. this is hard."

142
00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.945
- You know. that skateboard has
gone on to be kind of a thing.

143
00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.948
It's now--we--
it's in the Smithsonian.

144
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.659
- Freedom.

145
00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:45.246
I'm moving fast.
but I'm in control

146
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:47.456
and I'm flowing.

147
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.708
I could just
cruise the landscape.

148
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.086
Going down hills.

149
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:55.589
Terrible ramps
in our driveway.

150
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.008
Everything about it
spoke to me.

151
00:11:58.092 --> 00:11:59.176
- He just needed focus.

152
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.304
and so when he started
focusing and skateboarding.

153
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.140
he changed.

154
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:11.981
- He just calmed down.

155
00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.607
He just walked
through the world

156
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:18.154
with a lot more kind of
maturity and generosity.

157
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.159
- The main skate park
in San Diego was called Oasis.

158
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.995
It was just under
a freeway overpass.

159
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.413
And we would see it.
and it was like.

160
00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:29.290
"Oh. there's Oasis."

161
00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:32.251
Older kids going way faster

162
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.378
than I had ever seen
anyone on a skateboard.

163
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.843
And it just looked
scary as hell.

164
00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.554
There were these five craters.

165
00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.723
and I was going
down the crater and up

166
00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:46.891
and then down the crater
and up.

167
00:12:46.974 --> 00:12:48.684
and I thought
that was super cool.

168
00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.187
And this big kid
came flying up.

169
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.689
and he jumped
over the middle crater.

170
00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:57.359
and I was like.
"How did that just happen?"

171
00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.195
I just couldn't believe
what I saw.

172
00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.280
and I said. "Oh. this is it.

173
00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:03.324
I'm doing this.
This is my life."

174
00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:07.995
I quit playing baseball
and basketball.

175
00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.883
- I remember once
when I was home from college.

176
00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.384
my mom asked me
to go pick him up

177
00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.552
at the Oasis skate park

178
00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.889
because dinner
was almost ready.

179
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.433
So I was just gonna run
down there and grab him.

180
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:30.893
but he was in the process

181
00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.728
of learning
frontside rock and rolls.

182
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.980
And he was getting close.
and so of course.

183
00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.566
you know. the closer you get.
the more you slam. and--

184
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.692
but he was young enough

185
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.028
where he was actually crying.
I think. over this.

186
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:43.697
And I'm like.
"Tony. come on. we got to go."

187
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.074
And he's like.
"I'm gonna make"--

188
00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.785
Just. I wasn't even there.
you know?

189
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:53.415
And then finally. he made one
clean and rolled away.

190
00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.545
And it was like
everything kind of lifted.

191
00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.297
And he didn't. like. run over
and give me a high five.

192
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.049
It was like--
"Okay."

193
00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:06.637
And I've seen that
in him a bunch

194
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.930
when he's learning something.

195
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.432
He'll get really pissed off.

196
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.602
and then as soon
as he makes it.

197
00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:18.816
he's back to being his nice.
normal Tony Hawk self.

198
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:33.581
- I knew of Stacy's name
because of the Dogtown crew.

199
00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:36.709
And so I knew
more of his reputation

200
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.460
than his skating.

201
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.045
- Stacy had been there.

202
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:41.380
You know.
he'd blazed the trail.

203
00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:42.798
He had been a pro.

204
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:45.634
He knew
what that was all about.

205
00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.803
- He was just
this iconic figure.

206
00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.972
He formed the Bones Brigade.

207
00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:57.021
- He just seemed like
this sort of--

208
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.772
I wouldn't say father figure.

209
00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.150
but definitely a figurehead
of skateboarding.

210
00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.155
- I was a fixture at every one
of these contests.

211
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.615
I was at every pro contest.

212
00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:09.783
I was at every
amateur contest.

213
00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.247
Tony did not display

214
00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:18.042
any physical talent.

215
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.669
You could watch Tony
as a 13-year-old kid

216
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.213
and go. "Dime a dozen."

217
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:26.925
because he was so weak
and so skinny

218
00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:31.555
that he skated as if he was
being operated by a puppeteer.

219
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.974
He was just this kind of.
like. guy like this.

220
00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:38.646
But the one thing
that he did have is.

221
00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:42.149
you could see in this
little weakling of a kid

222
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:45.819
this intense determination.

223
00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:48.364
You could see in there.
there was a mind going.

224
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.366
"Do this! Do this!"

225
00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:56.163
- One time.
I was at the skate park.

226
00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:57.873
and the Bones Brigade
showed up.

227
00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.416
And you just knew it
immediately.

228
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.251
Like. there was a hush
in the skate park.

229
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.219
Everyone on the team
were considered

230
00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.553
some of the best skaters.

231
00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.389
And Stacy was walking in
with these guys.

232
00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:16.058
and they all had these. like.
cool-colored helmets

233
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:18.560
and their Bones Brigade
shirts.

234
00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.772
And I was just like.
"This is the future."

235
00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.732
- I remember Stacy was
at the park. and I'm like.

236
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.527
"Hey. is there any way I can
get on your guys' thing?"

237
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.071
Like. "Hey. man.

238
00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:32.199
"I think you should just
stick with G&S.

239
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:34.034
You'd be better on them. man."

240
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:38.205
He probably had the vision
of the Brigade right then.

241
00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:41.625
And maybe he was like.
"It's not gonna work. dog."

242
00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:44.712
- Stacy was gonna get
his own little phenoms

243
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.547
and younger guys
and build it up.

244
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.549
So I was like. "Wow.
I can get on the team."

245
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:54.805
- You know. Stacy Peralta

246
00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:58.934
was a cool kind of.
like. mentor

247
00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:02.271
for me at 12 years old
riding for Bones Brigade.

248
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:03.564
There came a point
where I was like.

249
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:04.982
"I want to turn pro."

250
00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:07.609
Stacy was like.
"No. you're not ready."

251
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.570
- I lost Christian Hosoi.

252
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:12.030
His dad didn't think I was
moving his career along

253
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.575
fast enough.
so I had a vacancy.

254
00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:16.994
And I had been watching Tony.

255
00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:20.497
- He kind of summoned me
to Marina del Rey.

256
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.875
My brother offered
to drive me up there.

257
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.627
We got up there. he handed me
this experimental

258
00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:28.297
Steve Caballero
model skateboard.

259
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.341
and I just started skating.
and I jumped the channel.

260
00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:34.178
And that was no small feat
to jump the Marina channel.

261
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:35.471
That thing was big.

262
00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.972
And basically. he said.

263
00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.474
"If you want to be
on the Bones Brigade.

264
00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.267
we'd love to have you."

265
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.519
- He realized
this kid's got grit.

266
00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:43.812
He doesn't give up.

267
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.899
He's also really skilled.

268
00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:48.901
He's also gonna get bigger
and get stronger.

269
00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:08.003
- When I was officially
on the team of Powell.

270
00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:10.881
that was way scarier
than anything else.

271
00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:13.634
where it was suddenly like
I was on this next level

272
00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:18.138
of team. of ability.
of belief.

273
00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:22.267
and I had so much more
to prove.

274
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.520
- The first time I saw Tony.
I was like.

275
00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:26.313
"Look at this little kid."

276
00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:30.526
He was probably. I don't know.
60 pounds wet. maybe.

277
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.819
- We were in a hot tub.

278
00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:35.531
We were hazing him like
he's the new guy on the team.

279
00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:37.115
I said. "Hey. dude.
if you want to--you know.

280
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.367
"if you want to be
part of the crew.

281
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.244
you're gonna have
to give me your gum."

282
00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:42.704
And I stuck it
in between my toes.

283
00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.122
And then I gave it back to him.

284
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:45.666
I go. "You're gonna have
to chew this gum

285
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.000
if you want to be
part of the crew."

286
00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.836
And he did.

287
00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.003
- Now with Tony Hawk.

288
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.380
Tony just finished
that first round.

289
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.382
Do you think you're gonna make
the next cut to eight?

290
00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.342
- Uh. I think I have
a pretty good chance.

291
00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:57.177
because I stayed on my board.

292
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:59.263
and that's pretty tough
to do in a competition.

293
00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:02.140
- Who do you think your
competition's gonna be today?

294
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:04.768
- Uh. probably--
I'm gonna have a tough time

295
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.770
beating pretty much anyone
who entered.

296
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:10.858
Mainly Lance Mountain.
Mike McGill. Stevie Caballero.

297
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.367
- He was a nightmare.
Total nightmare.

298
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.202
Complete. total nightmare.

299
00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:24.913
I remember when I first
picked him up on the team.

300
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.832
we were at
the Upland skateboard park.

301
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.375
and I said. "Well.
I'm gonna take you home."

302
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.878
And he goes. "No. I want
to go to Chuck E. Cheese."

303
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:31.962
And I go. "What's that?"

304
00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.922
He goes. "I want to go
to Chuck E. Cheese."

305
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.090
And I go. "Yeah. what is it?"

306
00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.842
He goes. "It's a pizza place
where you can play games."

307
00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.552
I go. "I'm not going there."

308
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.100
It was a Chuck E. Cheese.

309
00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:46.727
I know what he's talking about.

310
00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:55.569
There was a--
I'm a creature of habit.

311
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.571
and so when we would
go skate Upland.

312
00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:58.864
there were only
a few restaurants

313
00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:02.951
that I would allow myself
to go to.

314
00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.995
And Lamppost Pizza
was one of them.

315
00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:07.414
Like. a mild version
of Chuck E. Cheese.

316
00:20:07.497 --> 00:20:10.459
It was lots of games
and counter service.

317
00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:13.962
And they weren't known
for their cuisine.

318
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.714
- He got me to take him there.

319
00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:17.507
It was the worst nightmare
of my life.

320
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:19.134
but I'm sitting there going.

321
00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:21.720
"This 13-year-old brat
just got me to do something

322
00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:23.347
"I was firmly against doing.

323
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.140
He's got some power."

324
00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:27.643
Just the décor and the sounds

325
00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.604
and all the awful food.

326
00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:33.523
And I remember just thinking.
"I'm never doing this again.

327
00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:36.360
I'm never coming back
to this place again."

328
00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:37.778
- Stacy had the worst job.

329
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:39.696
I mean. he was--

330
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.406
he curated this awesome team.

331
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.075
but we were all kids
in our own right.

332
00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:45.619
and we're all
with our own issues

333
00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:49.331
and looking for validation.
looking for support.

334
00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:53.377
And suddenly. he had to be
this surrogate dad.

335
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.337
- I think the first time
I saw Tony skate

336
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.131
was at Kona Skatepark.

337
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.717
I had just gotten on the team.

338
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.428
and they all came
from out west.

339
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.222
And I remember meeting him.

340
00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:06.848
and I was so--

341
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.351
I tripped out
because of how skinny he was.

342
00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.478
It was as though he had
a hard time

343
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.146
getting up the wall.

344
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.900
But the control he had
was insane.

345
00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:21.446
Immediately. you got a sense
that he's entirely different.

346
00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.826
- Rodney Mullen. like.
he and I were on

347
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:29.162
complete parallel trajectories
with our skating.

348
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:32.791
Rodney was the absolute best
freestyler in the world.

349
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:37.379
a precision level
like no other athlete

350
00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:41.049
or performer you've ever seen.

351
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.386
- Because we skated
completely different.

352
00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:47.806
that made it easier for me
to relate to him. in a sense.

353
00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:50.225
I never had to compete
against Tony.

354
00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.190
Stacy would ship me down.
and I would stay with Tony.

355
00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:59.693
practice for the week
at Del Mar.

356
00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:04.197
That's when a real sense
of connection. for me.

357
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:06.575
I had with Tony
more than any other skater.

358
00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:11.538
- No one understood us.

359
00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:14.750
But we understood each other.

360
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:28.305
- I think watching Tony learn
and fall

361
00:22:28.388 --> 00:22:31.224
is more interesting
than watching him land tricks.

362
00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:34.144
because you can see
how fast he rifles

363
00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:36.730
to something called
the calculus of variations.

364
00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:38.732
of how he corrects himself

365
00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:41.568
and gets
to the right spot fast.

366
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:45.614
That. to this day.
is unparalleled.

367
00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:49.743
- Tony was able to figure out
how to overcome

368
00:22:49.826 --> 00:22:51.745
all of the things
he didn't have

369
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:53.747
in order to get what he wanted.

370
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.248
For instance.

371
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:57.417
when skateboarders
originally did aerials.

372
00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.086
they'd go up
the side of the pool.

373
00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.712
and they'd pull the board off

374
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.798
and kind of do
a leap into the air.

375
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.132
Tony couldn't do that.

376
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:06.843
He didn't have
the strength to leap.

377
00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:10.055
Most guys touch the board.
grab it. leap into the air.

378
00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:13.767
Tony figures out.
"I'll ollie into my aerials."

379
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.812
He doesn't touch the board
until he's in the air.

380
00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.313
You never break your speed.

381
00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.107
It's one bang.

382
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.484
Well. we discover
it's much more efficient

383
00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:23.944
to do it that way.

384
00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:26.613
- When I figured that out.

385
00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:29.282
that changed everything
for me.

386
00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:31.409
I started doing varials
and finger flips

387
00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:32.828
way up in the air.

388
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.663
- But of course.
when he first did it.

389
00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:35.914
people thought he was cheating.

390
00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:37.207
"That's cheating."

391
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.167
It's a technique.
How can you be cheating?

392
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.461
"It's cheating."
They thought it was cheating.

393
00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:44.673
You know. and at that time.
skateboarding was dominated

394
00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:47.384
by balls-out pool riders.

395
00:23:47.467 --> 00:23:49.344
Duane Peters. people like that

396
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:52.514
that really had
power and flair.

397
00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:53.890
And here comes Tony Hawk

398
00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:56.101
with all these
weird little flip tricks.

399
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:59.479
Those guys are looking at him
and going. "What is this?"

400
00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:01.481
- A lot of that shit. dude.
I mean.

401
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:04.025
I still can't understand it
when I look at it.

402
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:08.321
It's like fuckin'
flippy doo-da-day bullshit.

403
00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.283
Go fucking play
with your sister's baton. bro.

404
00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:15.162
- Want me to do it again?

405
00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:16.705
- Yeah. go ahead.

406
00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:17.998
Okay.

407
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:19.416
What do you think
of skateboarding?

408
00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:21.293
- What do I think of it?

409
00:24:21.376 --> 00:24:22.711
Well. I've supported it
pretty strong

410
00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.504
for a lot of years.

411
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.889
- Confusion.
- Confusion?

412
00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.223
- My dad wanted to make sure

413
00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.766
that there was organization
in place.

414
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.895
that if Tony was gonna
be this committed to it.

415
00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:43.023
you know. he could actually
get some recognition for it.

416
00:24:43.106 --> 00:24:45.775
- My dad helped
to form the NSA.

417
00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.820
which became
the sanctioning body

418
00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:50.572
for all the main events.

419
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:53.033
- The NSA was the National
Skateboard Association.

420
00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:55.410
And people used to say.
"No skating allowed."

421
00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:58.538
And especially Mr. Hawk being
the guy who was. you know.

422
00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:00.207
yelling at people
to get off the ramp.

423
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.417
- Do not
come down to the ramp.

424
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.211
Please. get off the ramp.

425
00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.465
- He loved yelling at kids.

426
00:25:08.548 --> 00:25:09.925
You know.
"Get behind the barrier!"

427
00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.760
He loved doing that.

428
00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:14.971
- He just--he always had
this grimace about him.

429
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:15.972
Super serious.

430
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:20.018
Never saw him smile
or laugh about anything.

431
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:23.104
Just always walking around
kind of like a--

432
00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:24.731
I don't think he drank.
but he seemed like

433
00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:27.108
just a pissed-off alcoholic.
basically.

434
00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.902
- He was a bull
in a china shop.

435
00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:32.405
He had no finesse whatsoever.

436
00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:35.408
But he actually had
a really. really good heart.

437
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.827
I mean. he came at a time
in skateboarding

438
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.913
where skateboarding
really needed a guy

439
00:25:39.996 --> 00:25:43.083
like Frank Hawk to say.
"Look at this circus carnival.

440
00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:44.918
We got to focus this
a little bit."

441
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.461
- And this is giving
in those spots.

442
00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.171
and they're riding it
and going "uh. uh. uh."

443
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:49.506
- And he did a remarkable job.

444
00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:50.799
and he didn't get
anything for it

445
00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:52.634
except crap from people.

446
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:55.887
- He carried around. like.
a little ledger a lot

447
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:57.597
and was always looking harsh
at people.

448
00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:02.310
- I remember going.
"Fuck you." to his old man.

449
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.853
Like.
"Get the fuck out of here.

450
00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:06.064
"and take these
fucking grubby kids with--

451
00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:07.732
get a fucking job."

452
00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:10.193
I'd go across the fence.

453
00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:12.779
"Get a fucking job."
You know.

454
00:26:12.862 --> 00:26:14.698
"Now he wants to bring
his Army shit

455
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.574
to the National
Skateboarding Associ"--

456
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:18.451
you know. blah. blah.

457
00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:21.997
- He just came off
as gruff and militant.

458
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.082
and they were like.
"Fuck that dude.

459
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:25.125
That's your dad?"

460
00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:28.169
Like. and that would be
reflected on me.

461
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:36.511
- Right....now.

462
00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:41.683
- One of the first times
I ever got to skate with pros.

463
00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:45.937
I remember seeing Steve Olson
and Duane Peters.

464
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.981
and. of course.
I knew both of them.

465
00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:49.316
They're heroes.

466
00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:50.984
So I went over
to kind of skate

467
00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:53.194
near the area
they were skating

468
00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:56.406
and kept sort of
inching my way closer to them.

469
00:26:56.489 --> 00:26:59.492
- They were in a bowl.
and we were riding up.

470
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:04.456
We'd either chase them out
or go to the next one.

471
00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:07.375
- I wanted to be near them.

472
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.045
I wanted to be
skating with them.

473
00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.546
- "Fuck this."

474
00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:14.215
I mean. these geeky kids.

475
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.508
"Hey. we want to follow you."

476
00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:17.552
- And they were laughing
about something.

477
00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:18.887
some inside joke.

478
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.222
And I kind of snickered.
"Yeah. yeah." you know?

479
00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:23.058
Like. "Yeah. yeah."
like I'm in on the joke.

480
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:27.020
Duane turned towards me.
spit on my grip tape.

481
00:27:27.103 --> 00:27:29.397
and was like.
"This is punk rock. kid."

482
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.859
- I don't remember spitting
on Hawk. but he does.

483
00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.527
I did this shit a lot.

484
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:38.156
especially to guys
that are coming in to--

485
00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.657
wanting to be pro.

486
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:41.576
They're coming in
to take our spots.

487
00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:42.702
Fuck you.

488
00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:55.423
- It just reminded me
that I don't belong

489
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.175
and this is a mistake

490
00:27:57.258 --> 00:28:01.596
and I can't even fit
into the skateboard world.

491
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:02.931
That was heavy for me.

492
00:28:06.893 --> 00:28:08.603
- He took a lot of shit.

493
00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:12.232
He got a lot--people fired
a lot of arrows at him.

494
00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:15.068
He never really let on
how much that hurt. I think.

495
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:17.028
at the time in the skate world.

496
00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:20.156
And he never showed...

497
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:24.160
Kind of that resentful side

498
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:26.204
that I'm sure
he must've been feeling.

499
00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:27.914
He just put his head down
and said. "Fuck it.

500
00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:29.749
"I'm gonna skate
as hard as I can.

501
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:32.168
"I'm gonna get
as good as I can.

502
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:35.296
"and I'm gonna show
these assholes that. you know.

503
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.798
I'm the best skater
out there."

504
00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:44.305
- Leading up to this
Whittier contest.

505
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.559
November of 1982.

506
00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:51.521
I had just done really well
at the pro versus am event.

507
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:53.481
All my peers were pro.

508
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.608
And it was like.
"You're next."

509
00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:57.777
At the competition.

510
00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.737
we're filling out
the entry forms.

511
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.656
It says "pro or amateur" box.

512
00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.992
Like. that determines
which category you're in.

513
00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.996
And I remember feeling Stacy
looking over my shoulder.

514
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.291
I just checked pro.

515
00:29:11.374 --> 00:29:13.918
Then I looked up at him.
and I go. "Is that okay?"

516
00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:15.837
And he's like. "If that's
what you want to do."

517
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.505
And then I was pro.

518
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.007
- That was it.
- That was it.

519
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:23.178
There's no--
there's no champagne.

520
00:29:25.847 --> 00:29:30.268
I suddenly felt.
"This is super scary."

521
00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:32.937
Duane Peters is skating.

522
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:36.441
My first thought was.
"Don't put me against Duane."

523
00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:39.360
- I went against him
on his first contest.

524
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.488
- First head-to-head event
as a pro.

525
00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:43.114
I'm going against
Duane Peters.

526
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:46.326
- This is gonna be easy.
I'm taking this fucker.

527
00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:47.994
- Duane Peters.
These guys go head-on-head.

528
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:49.162
It's who does better.

529
00:30:00.423 --> 00:30:01.341
- Go!

530
00:30:25.365 --> 00:30:28.868
- I can't see how difficult
these tricks are.

531
00:30:28.952 --> 00:30:31.871
They just look
fucking lame to me.

532
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:34.874
- I knew for sure he did not
want me to beat him.

533
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:37.126
My thought was.
"Stay on target.

534
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.087
Make your run."

535
00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:54.602
- Tony's dad's all excited.

536
00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.604
They're all
by the judging thing.

537
00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:04.612
- Tony Hawk beats out
Duane Peters at 86.66.

538
00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:06.739
- I heard the scores.

539
00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.700
and it took a second
for it to register.

540
00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:10.910
And I was thinking.
"I beat Duane?

541
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.245
"I beat Duane.

542
00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:14.581
I beat Duane!"

543
00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:18.293
- I was an old guy
on his way out.

544
00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:20.169
New crew coming in.

545
00:31:22.338 --> 00:31:26.801
That hurt. and--'cause I was--

546
00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.469
all of a sudden.
it mattered to me.

547
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:30.471
- Was that your last contest?
- Yeah.

548
00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.265
Pretty much everybody's. yeah.

549
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.478
- Hi. I'm Bob Burbanks.

550
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.439
and welcome to "Weekend Today."

551
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:41.691
We're gonna take an exciting
look at skateboarding.

552
00:31:41.774 --> 00:31:44.777
This is a skateboard.
- That's not a skateboard.

553
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:46.112
- Some neighborhood
daredevils...

554
00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:47.614
- We're gonna do
a little adjusting here.

555
00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.449
- Right here
on "Weekend Today."

556
00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:58.124
- Now. this is a skateboard.

557
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:14.349
- Stacy took a chance
putting out money

558
00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.768
to make a video
of skateboarding.

559
00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:20.021
- We originally made
the Bones Brigade videos

560
00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:22.940
thinking that skateboard shops
would play them.

561
00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:24.317
And then. we didn't realize.

562
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.069
but the release
of the first one

563
00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:29.947
coincided with 70%
of Americans buying VCRs.

564
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:32.867
- I think a lot of people.

565
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.535
that's where
they first saw me.

566
00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.083
- And it also coincided

567
00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:43.211
when Tony started
to get strong.

568
00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.588
- That was when Tony
first kind of came in

569
00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:47.090
as this wunderkind.

570
00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:49.717
So when the first
Bones Brigade video came out.

571
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.970
which was the first
action sports video ever made.

572
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:54.931
Tony was on the cover.

573
00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:56.891
- It was so fun to see it.

574
00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.559
It was so fun to see everyone

575
00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:01.229
separately but together
in the same video.

576
00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:03.481
And Lance was the thread
that brought it all in.

577
00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:06.859
And when I saw my part.
I thought it was super cool.

578
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:09.028
I just couldn't believe
that he had managed

579
00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:11.239
to make it all work together.

580
00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:13.616
And he's putting things
in slo-mo.

581
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.493
I mean. it just felt like--

582
00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:17.161
like it was my birthday party.

583
00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:30.925
- Caballero and Tony were
always in the top five.

584
00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.927
and I was kind of
fading a bit. you know?

585
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.388
And I was just finding it
harder and harder

586
00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.098
to get up into that top ten.

587
00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.225
And I'm like. "Oh. I guess
this is it for me.

588
00:33:39.308 --> 00:33:41.519
I need something.
you know. that's"--

589
00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:43.604
so I started going
to some of these camps.

590
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.565
you know. helping to teach.

591
00:33:45.648 --> 00:33:49.527
And at one Swedish camp.
I. you know. made this trick

592
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.239
called the McTwist.
which is a 540.

593
00:33:53.322 --> 00:33:56.117
People would ask me.
"What is that. Mike?"

594
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.620
- Mike McGill came
to a Del Mar contest.

595
00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:02.749
and there was all this buzz
that he had a new trick.

596
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:06.461
And people were purposely
not telling me what it was.

597
00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:09.380
because they thought somehow
I was gonna learn it.

598
00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:13.342
Mike shows up.
and first day of practice.

599
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:14.510
he does a McTwist.

600
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:19.474
Full 1 1/2 somersault
in the air.

601
00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:22.268
coming down forward.
going backside direction.

602
00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:25.605
which means you're totally
blind to your landing zone.

603
00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:28.399
And it was just like.
"What happened?

604
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:31.778
Were you training
with gymnasts?"

605
00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:33.279
I knew then and there

606
00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:35.281
that I was gonna have
to learn it.

607
00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:38.409
- There's a few tricks that
have been chased for years.

608
00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:40.661
And it was one that everyone
knew could be possible.

609
00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.288
but no one knew how to do it

610
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:45.082
or try it or even have
the guts to try it right.

611
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:47.210
And it took McGill to do it.
which was.

612
00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:48.753
you got to do it 6 foot out.

613
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:50.004
You can't do it low.

614
00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:52.381
Everyone was trying it low
to figure it out.

615
00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:55.510
And you had to have the actual
wherewithal to. like.

616
00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:58.221
"Oh. I've got to launch
into the sky

617
00:34:58.304 --> 00:34:59.931
and see what happens."

618
00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:01.557
- That kind of spiraled me

619
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:05.770
and put me in the top five
every contest.

620
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:07.230
- You developed the McTwist.

621
00:35:07.313 --> 00:35:08.815
Are you gonna be able to
pull that off here in this--

622
00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:10.608
- Uh. hopefully.

623
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:12.610
- When I did try it.

624
00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:15.279
I realized
how much harder it is

625
00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:16.781
than I thought it would be.

626
00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:18.991
I didn't come close.

627
00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.827
I couldn't see
my landing zone.

628
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.663
I don't even know if I had
a good hold on my board.

629
00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:25.832
- I can imagine how hard
you slam on that trick.

630
00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:27.208
'cause you're just
spinning freely.

631
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.585
and if you overturn.
it's done. dude.

632
00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:36.217
- I was hyper-focused.
obsessed with the trick.

633
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.386
I had to figure it out.

634
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.513
I remember being in school

635
00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:43.432
and just knowing
the bell's gonna ring

636
00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:44.725
and I'm going
straight to the park

637
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.893
and trying McTwists.

638
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.646
That was the only thing
I was focused on.

639
00:35:48.729 --> 00:35:51.607
I started getting the spin
more consistent.

640
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.860
I started seeing
the landing zone.

641
00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:55.528
and then it was
pretty obvious. like.

642
00:35:55.611 --> 00:35:57.238
well. there's only
one more stage.

643
00:35:57.321 --> 00:36:00.324
and that's just that you got
to suck it up and land.

644
00:36:00.408 --> 00:36:01.909
- How hard was that trick
to learn?

645
00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:02.952
- Simple.

646
00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:04.620
- Simple?
- Mm-hmm.

647
00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:07.039
It's not technique.
It's balls.

648
00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:08.332
And I have no problem
spinning it.

649
00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:10.501
but do I want to set it down?

650
00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:13.379
That's all just guts.

651
00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:34.066
- The 540 was the trick

652
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.568
that you needed
to win competitions.

653
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:37.194
and once you learned
that trick.

654
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.654
you were in top three.

655
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.698
- Did you attempt them?

656
00:36:40.781 --> 00:36:42.408
- I thought about doing them.

657
00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:46.245
And then I did some low stuff
like Tony used to do.

658
00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.455
And I just started trying to--

659
00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.998
and it was just like. "No way."

660
00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:51.542
So I couldn't do it.
I just backed out.

661
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.628
I was like.
"It's not gonna work.

662
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:56.255
- Neil Blender. are you gonna
make the finals tomorrow?

663
00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:57.298
- No.

664
00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:59.717
They just called them out.
Didn't even make it.

665
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.011
Should've seen me.
falling all over the bowl.

666
00:37:02.094 --> 00:37:03.971
- There was contests
I couldn't skate at all.

667
00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.599
and I'd just do. "Oh.
I'll do an axis ollie 540."

668
00:37:06.682 --> 00:37:08.559
Made the cut. Whew.

669
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:11.145
Money. done.
Paid.

670
00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:12.813
Buy diapers.
Done deal.

671
00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:14.231
- And it just became

672
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.108
this proving ground.
where it was just like.

673
00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:18.361
"Are you doing a McTwist
or not?"

674
00:37:18.444 --> 00:37:20.947
'Cause this is where
we're all going towards.

675
00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.842
- Okay. next skater up.

676
00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.678
Christian Hosoi.

677
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.848
- Christian was a showman.

678
00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.892
He could show up
with his shirt off.

679
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:51.686
dangling out
of his back pocket.

680
00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.437
and the crowd was with him.

681
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.942
It was all style and air
with Christian.

682
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:00.319
and it was all technical
and tricks with me.

683
00:38:00.403 --> 00:38:02.655
and people had to choose.

684
00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:04.448
- There was a contest
at Del Mar.

685
00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:09.370
The fans were like. you know.
"Hosoi. Hosoi. Hosoi!"

686
00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.830
- Next up. Tony Hawk.

687
00:38:10.913 --> 00:38:12.498
riding for Powell-Peralta
and Tracker Trucks.

688
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:13.874
Tony. whenever you're ready.

689
00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:19.547
- Whenever I would go.
they would just be booing.

690
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.590
- You know. at his home park
at Del Mar.

691
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:25.219
I thought. you know.
the crowd was pretty rough.

692
00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:28.264
crowd: Christian! Christian!
Christian!

693
00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:30.766
Christian! Christian!
Christian!

694
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.353
Christian! Christian!
Christian! Christian!

695
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:36.188
- These guys are just
getting mad at him.

696
00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.107
because they're
seeing him do tricks.

697
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.734
Like. they want to see
some older shit.

698
00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.193
a long lip slide
or something. like.

699
00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:42.903
and it's just not gonna happen.

700
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:47.033
They were pissed. throwing
beer cans and whatever else.

701
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.535
- I fell on one of the runs
near the end.

702
00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:52.329
And I fell near this beer can.

703
00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:54.331
Like. I almost slid into it.

704
00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:57.585
And I was just like. "Really?"

705
00:38:57.668 --> 00:39:00.129
And so I grabbed it.
and I went to throw it

706
00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:01.797
back at them.
and I was just like. "Am I--

707
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:04.425
"I can't--
I can't play this game.

708
00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:06.635
"I'm gonna lose no matter what.

709
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:08.846
"I'm never gonna be seen
by these guys

710
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:10.598
"as legitimate or cool.

711
00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:13.768
And I just gotta suck it up
and do my own thing."

712
00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:17.438
- 96.666.

713
00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:20.691
- I don't think
that people understand

714
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.401
that when you're skateboarding.

715
00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:25.446
it becomes an expression
of who you are. your identity.

716
00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:28.616
How you are embraced
as a person

717
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:31.577
is who you are.

718
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.082
That stuff is all on the line
during those contests.

719
00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.417
- All that noise.
I was just like.

720
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:39.585
"All right. I'm just gonna--

721
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:41.003
head down.
I'm gonna do the work."

722
00:39:41.087 --> 00:39:42.171
- And he came in.

723
00:39:42.254 --> 00:39:45.424
and he just took it out on 'em.

724
00:39:46.592 --> 00:39:49.136
He was just focused.

725
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.371
- 93.000.

726
00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.664
Tony Hawk is the winner!

727
00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:10.384
- When I finally started
to have some success

728
00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:11.886
in competition.

729
00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.889
I was getting blasted
in the magazines.

730
00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:16.807
"Thrasher" would write
that there was favoritism

731
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:17.808
in the competitions

732
00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:19.143
'cause my dad
was helping running it

733
00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:21.395
and the finals were
always at Del Mar

734
00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:22.396
and that's my local park.

735
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.440
and so the whole thing was
just made for me.

736
00:41:24.523 --> 00:41:26.692
He's daddy's boy.

737
00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:29.111
- It was very easy
for all the skaters to think

738
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.489
that somehow Frank Hawk's
pulling the strings.

739
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:34.241
Really easy to do that.
He couldn't.

740
00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.744
You know. all he did
was organize this thing.

741
00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:38.621
- Even I did it at some point.
you know?

742
00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:41.540
I was like. "Wait a minute.
Your son's in the last heat.

743
00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:42.708
How come
I'm in the first heat?"

744
00:41:42.791 --> 00:41:45.085
- It was just hard.
It was hard being an outcast.

745
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:48.088
It was hard being a skater

746
00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:50.591
whose style no one appreciated.

747
00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:54.261
And then my dad just added
to that formula.

748
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.138
and it was just. like--
I was just ostracized.

749
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.068
I just felt that his presence
was too intrusive

750
00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:13.239
and was affecting me
and my relationships so much

751
00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:17.868
that there was no escape
from it unless he backed off.

752
00:42:19.328 --> 00:42:20.955
Finally I just told him.
you know.

753
00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.998
"I don't like it
when you're at the events.

754
00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:25.584
It's way harder for me."

755
00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:26.794
He didn't take it well.

756
00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.212
He wasn't--it wasn't--

757
00:42:28.295 --> 00:42:29.797
there was not gonna be
a compromise.

758
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.966
His answer was basically.

759
00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.592
"Well. then I just won't--
I won't go.

760
00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:34.760
"I just won't do these events.

761
00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:36.136
You just want me
not to be in there at all?"

762
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.014
And I'm like. "Well..."

763
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:42.142
Things got icy between us.
and at the next event.

764
00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:45.062
he purposely tried
to keep his distance.

765
00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:47.106
And I guess that's the best
I could hope for

766
00:42:47.189 --> 00:42:49.275
without him
quitting altogether.

767
00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:51.026
- Now. you're the father
of Tony Hawk.

768
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.403
How does it feel
when you see your son

769
00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:53.696
go in there and compete?

770
00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:55.281
- Oh. I'm thrilled to death.

771
00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:57.950
I have to kind of force myself
to keep subdued

772
00:42:58.033 --> 00:43:00.494
so I don't let people think
I'm giving him an advantage

773
00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:01.745
in a contest or something.

774
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.748
So when we get to a contest.
we're strangers to each other.

775
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.667
But I'm very proud of him.

776
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.756
- I think I was 15 or 16.

777
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.800
My mom moved to Arizona

778
00:43:14.883 --> 00:43:18.679
to pursue her doctorate
in business education.

779
00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:20.723
And so she was gone.

780
00:43:22.057 --> 00:43:24.810
It definitely changed
the dynamic in the household.

781
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.856
One day. he came in
and he just said.

782
00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.524
"Hey. Tony. I think
I'm having chest pains.

783
00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:32.901
"I think--you know.
I don't know.

784
00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:35.904
"but it feels like
something's wrong.

785
00:43:35.988 --> 00:43:38.699
I think we need
to call an ambulance."

786
00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:41.994
And I kind of freaked out.
'cause I thought.

787
00:43:42.077 --> 00:43:44.663
"I'm here alone with my dad."

788
00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:48.167
We never had any conversations

789
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.919
that were deep or loving.

790
00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:52.880
And so I told him.
I just--you know.

791
00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.631
"I want you to know
that I'm thankful

792
00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:58.052
for everything you did for me.
and I love you."

793
00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:02.389
And he said. "I know you do."

794
00:44:05.517 --> 00:44:08.062
The hardest part
about that whole scenario

795
00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.397
was taking him to the hospital

796
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.817
and then coming home.

797
00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:16.528
And I was truly alone.

798
00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:20.699
And I was--
and my mom was gone.

799
00:44:20.783 --> 00:44:24.078
And then I just didn't
really know what to do.

800
00:44:26.955 --> 00:44:32.294
- What ultimately happened is--
was a bypass.

801
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:36.006
My dad changed
his habits a bit.

802
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.257
You know. he was walking more.

803
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:39.385
He was--changed his diet
a little bit.

804
00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:42.054
But then he just gradually
got back

805
00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:45.974
to the same kind of old Frank.

806
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:47.476
- Did you all try
to talk to him

807
00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:49.770
and get him to be healthier
and...

808
00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:52.356
- No. I didn't.

809
00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:53.690
No.

810
00:44:56.985 --> 00:45:00.948
- Tony's training ground was
the Del Mar skateboard park.

811
00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:02.449
The pool was a vertical pool.

812
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.910
but the left wall
wasn't quite so vertical.

813
00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:07.871
It was almost like
a beautiful transition.

814
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:10.207
so it was a perfect place
to learn tricks.

815
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.167
And that seemed
to be the place

816
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:15.129
Tony did all of his
most difficult tricks.

817
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:17.172
- That's where I skated
my best.

818
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:18.674
I had it dialed.
I had it wired.

819
00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:20.259
And when I would go
to other parks.

820
00:45:20.342 --> 00:45:21.510
I was out of place.

821
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:22.803
I didn't have confidence.

822
00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:25.305
I didn't know how to use
the transitions.

823
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.991
- Most of his adversaries
skated Upland.

824
00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:47.619
a really. really deep.
big. giant pool.

825
00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:48.996
- Upland was considered

826
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.581
the gnarliest pool
at the time.

827
00:45:50.664 --> 00:45:52.583
Like. if you did well
in an Upland contest.

828
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:54.418
you got the respect
of the skate industry

829
00:45:54.501 --> 00:45:56.170
and the hard-core skaters.

830
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:58.130
- That's a really
challenging pool.

831
00:45:58.213 --> 00:45:59.590
'cause it's a square pool

832
00:45:59.673 --> 00:46:02.050
and a round pool
and a radical hip.

833
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:04.386
It's a really.
really tricky place.

834
00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:09.516
- It's just scary.

835
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:16.648
If you're gonna ride Upland.
you got to go for it.

836
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:19.359
You can't just phone it in.
You can't cruise it.

837
00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.361
You gotta put yourself
at risk.

838
00:46:29.036 --> 00:46:31.747
- Tony knew this contest
was coming up.

839
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.166
and it was a huge contest.

840
00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:36.710
- I made it my mission
to get used to the pool.

841
00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:38.545
and I drove up there
every weekend.

842
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.881
It was the first time
I truly worked

843
00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.050
at getting used
to different terrain

844
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:44.676
to prove myself beyond

845
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.720
being this one-trick pony
at Del Mar.

846
00:46:51.892 --> 00:46:53.519
- Tony. you're the big winner
from Del Mar.

847
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:54.895
Do you think
you'll be able to do it?

848
00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:55.938
- I don't know.

849
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:57.481
I'm having a pretty tough time
in this pool.

850
00:46:57.564 --> 00:46:59.358
- What makes this one
different from Del Mar?

851
00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:00.651
- Well. it's got
a lot more vert.

852
00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:02.569
and it's a lot rougher

853
00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:05.030
and big coping.
so it's harder to ride.

854
00:47:05.113 --> 00:47:06.031
- Big coping.

855
00:47:06.114 --> 00:47:07.866
Who's your toughest
competition?

856
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:09.576
- Shoot.

857
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.537
I'd stay Stevie.
Lance. Christian.

858
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.705
Psh. all those guys.

859
00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:14.915
- Well. good luck
on your competition.

860
00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:15.999
- Thanks.

861
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:18.418
- Let's hear it for Tony Hawk!

862
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.265
- I had a run that was
sort of my safety run.

863
00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:33.809
where it was good. but didn't
have all the tricks.

864
00:47:33.892 --> 00:47:37.729
- The score is up.
81. 81.00.

865
00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:39.690
- Who's the person
to beat this time?

866
00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:42.985
- Uh. A lot of people.
Chris Miller.

867
00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:45.237
- Chris Miller
was the local favorite.

868
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.239
the best skater in that pool.

869
00:47:50.325 --> 00:47:52.202
He hung up
and knocked himself out.

870
00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:01.336
- Score is up.
80.00.

871
00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:08.302
- 81.0 for Stevie Caballero.

872
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.639
- And we have Lance Mountain
on the way.

873
00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.975
Score's 83.33.

874
00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.686
Let's hear it.
Lance Mountain. 83.33.

875
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:30.282
- On my second run. I landed
super low on a McTwist

876
00:48:30.365 --> 00:48:32.951
and then ended up
kind of screwing up my speed.

877
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:35.621
- Score 81.66.

878
00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:37.789
That wraps up the second round.

879
00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:40.167
- Came down to the last runs.

880
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.002
And then on my fourth run.

881
00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:43.879
I did exactly
what I came there to do.

882
00:48:43.962 --> 00:48:45.213
- This is Tony Hawk.

883
00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.673
going down
for round number two.

884
00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.717
Let's hear it.
Tony Hawk!

885
00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:03.023
- The combinations
that he did were amazing.

886
00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.316
Amazing.

887
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.278
- Skating the hardest parts
of the pool.

888
00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:10.113
sliding around the corners.

889
00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:26.546
I felt so at ease and confident

890
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.049
that I was singing in my run

891
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.259
the song that was playing
over the loudspeaker.

892
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:33.095
"She Goes to Finos." Toy Dolls.

893
00:49:56.118 --> 00:49:58.036
- It was like Luke Skywalker

894
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:02.541
going in to take out
Darth Vader at the Death Star.

895
00:50:02.624 --> 00:50:05.043
- Incredible.

896
00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:09.131
Score 85.66.
85.66.

897
00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:14.803
- He won a contest
that nobody in skateboarding

898
00:50:14.886 --> 00:50:18.682
ever expected him to win.
ever. under any circumstances.

899
00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:21.059
- And that's when
a lot of people shut up

900
00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:22.144
about my style.

901
00:50:22.227 --> 00:50:25.605
about me only being good
at Del Mar.

902
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.524
- To me. that's maybe
the biggest.

903
00:50:27.607 --> 00:50:29.526
most important win of his life.

904
00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:32.279
Once you can win there.
you can win anywhere.

905
00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:37.409
That was the beginning
of his launch

906
00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:38.702
to become Tony Hawk.

907
00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:54.217
- He grew taller
than all of us.

908
00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:58.513
His tricks got bigger.
and his airs got higher.

909
00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:08.607
- Do you have
a favorite skater?

910
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.650
- Tony Hawk.
- Tony Hawk?

911
00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.778
- Tony Hawk.
- Oh. very good.

912
00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:19.075
- Tony was obviously
gonna be a threat.

913
00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:20.285
People saw that.

914
00:51:20.368 --> 00:51:22.287
Even if it took five years
to get there.

915
00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:29.336
- All of a sudden. he started

916
00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.171
just winning
all these contests.

917
00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.381
Now he's got these tricks.
Now he's got this trick.

918
00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:35.675
He has every trick
going on and more.

919
00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.844
- Hawk!
Tony Hawk!

920
00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:45.227
- He was coming up
with a fantastic run.

921
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.395
and then all of a sudden.
he'd one-up himself.

922
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.818
- At every contest.
there'd be. like.

923
00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:54.486
three new tricks.

924
00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:57.697
He's spinning. he's varialing.
he's doing finger flips.

925
00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:06.706
- Here I am. I'm just trying
to go higher. farther. faster.

926
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.543
'cause I have to keep up
with Tony.

927
00:52:21.429 --> 00:52:25.016
- Taking home $2.000
is Tony Hawk!

928
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:46.079
- Tony's the youngest
skateboarder

929
00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:47.163
on the Bones Brigade.

930
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:51.167
So suddenly.
he's beating his idols--

931
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:54.045
Caballero. McGill. Lance.

932
00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:57.215
They used to kill him.
Now he's above 'em.

933
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.978
- First place
goes to Tony Hawk!

934
00:53:10.061 --> 00:53:12.022
3.000 bucks!

935
00:53:16.318 --> 00:53:17.652
- What's it gonna take to win?

936
00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:19.112
You're gonna have to beat
Tony Hawk. you know.

937
00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:21.531
He's number one right now.

938
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.887
- He would go basically win--

939
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.096
I don't know
what the record was.

940
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.348
but pretty much everything.

941
00:53:46.431 --> 00:53:47.974
And everybody'd be stoked.

942
00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.476
And maybe he would be lit up

943
00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:53.647
for long enough to take
the team photos or whatever.

944
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.941
But then you could immediately
see the wheels turning of.

945
00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:59.277
"Yeah.
but I should have done this."

946
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:01.112
And he would go
right back to it.

947
00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:06.117
- I was singularly focused
on skating

948
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:08.119
and doing well at the events

949
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:11.081
because that was
the only road to success.

950
00:54:11.164 --> 00:54:15.669
It probably affected
my emotional connections

951
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:18.338
because I couldn't think
of anything else.

952
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:21.216
I was obligated to go
to all the competitions.

953
00:54:21.299 --> 00:54:23.009
nonstop on the road.

954
00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:25.887
I had a formula
where I'd create a routine.

955
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:27.973
I had these backup tricks
that I was gonna do later.

956
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:29.391
and then I just started
doing that.

957
00:54:29.474 --> 00:54:31.851
and it was like
I was just a machine.

958
00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.353
- You feeling
any excess pressure

959
00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:34.729
now that you're in first place.

960
00:54:34.813 --> 00:54:36.731
or do you think
that's the better place to be?

961
00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:37.899
- Oh. I don't know.

962
00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:41.528
I mean. I guess I feel really
happy that I did that run

963
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.488
and I'm in first with it.
but I don't know.

964
00:54:43.571 --> 00:54:45.490
I'm just gonna do my best.
and if I do my best

965
00:54:45.573 --> 00:54:48.326
and I don't even win.
that's okay with me.

966
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:52.414
It got to the point where
it was somewhat repetitive

967
00:54:52.497 --> 00:54:56.543
and just methodical

968
00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:58.920
and robotic.

969
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:00.922
where I came in
and it was like.

970
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:02.132
"I'm gonna have to do this.

971
00:55:02.215 --> 00:55:04.050
"I'm gonna have to go
this much further.

972
00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.260
"because now they're judging me

973
00:55:05.343 --> 00:55:06.886
"on what they saw me do
last time.

974
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.722
So I gotta take it
one step further."

975
00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:11.891
And I became a machine.

976
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:15.562
And it really did
suck the fun out of it.

977
00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.522
Other skaters
would tell me. like.

978
00:55:17.605 --> 00:55:18.940
while we're practicing.

979
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:20.734
"Man. I just want
to get second."

980
00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:24.571
And I just took it
as I didn't have any peers.

981
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:27.157
It was just isolating.
It was a bummer.

982
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.366
I can't explain it.

983
00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.785
You know. the whole thing.
it's lonely at the top--it is.

984
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.463
- I think it's a quote
from Nietzsche's "Zarathustra."

985
00:55:41.546 --> 00:55:42.922
"You make it up
to the top of a mountain.

986
00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.632
and what's left for me
but lightning?"

987
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.100
- With all of the things
that were coming to him.

988
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:55.769
his father being at contests

989
00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:57.687
and the commotion
that his father causes

990
00:55:57.771 --> 00:55:59.481
with all the other
skateboarders.

991
00:55:59.564 --> 00:56:01.483
people blaming Tony
for winning

992
00:56:01.566 --> 00:56:03.234
because his father's
setting it up.

993
00:56:03.318 --> 00:56:05.236
people calling him
a clown skater

994
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.571
because of the tricks he does.

995
00:56:06.654 --> 00:56:08.448
people saying. "You don't
deserve to be doing this.

996
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:10.575
Christian should be winning."

997
00:56:10.658 --> 00:56:14.746
and at the same time.
achieving his dream.

998
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:16.998
He achieved his dream.

999
00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:18.416
And he got up there
and he realized

1000
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.710
how lonely it is.

1001
00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:23.588
- I felt like I was
losing myself.

1002
00:56:23.671 --> 00:56:25.673
losing my passion.

1003
00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:31.304
None of the money or fame
or success was worth that.

1004
00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:32.514
- Skating very well today.

1005
00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:36.309
- Um. not as well as I want to.

1006
00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.853
- The heat bothering you?
- Not so much that.

1007
00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:42.065
I'm just not really feeling
like skating right now.

1008
00:56:42.148 --> 00:56:43.149
- He just decided

1009
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:45.443
that he didn't want
to compete anymore.

1010
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:47.612
- I told my brother
how I was feeling.

1011
00:56:47.695 --> 00:56:48.780
He was really the only one

1012
00:56:48.863 --> 00:56:51.116
I felt like
I could confide in.

1013
00:56:51.199 --> 00:56:53.785
He said.
"You gotta tell Stacy."

1014
00:56:53.868 --> 00:56:57.372
- Tony was seriously
in a catatonic state

1015
00:56:57.455 --> 00:56:59.207
when he arrived at my house.

1016
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.417
He sat there
just looking at me like...

1017
00:57:03.294 --> 00:57:07.549
- You didn't tell Stacy that
you're gonna quit anything.

1018
00:57:07.632 --> 00:57:09.551
Who would do that?

1019
00:57:09.634 --> 00:57:11.678
- Steve proceeded to tell me

1020
00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:15.515
that it had all just become
too much for Tony.

1021
00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:20.228
He wasn't enjoying being
a professional skateboarder.

1022
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:25.191
I think that's as close
as he's ever gotten.

1023
00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.985
that I've seen.

1024
00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:29.612
to dealing with the pain
that's inside of him.

1025
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:40.999
- Driving home. there was
a sense of hopelessness.

1026
00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:44.961
And I didn't really know
what was gonna happen next.

1027
00:57:45.044 --> 00:57:47.297
Stacy told me
that Rodney Mullen

1028
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.132
had the same conversation
with him

1029
00:57:49.215 --> 00:57:51.593
about a year prior
to me telling him that.

1030
00:57:51.676 --> 00:57:53.386
And Rodney
had stopped competing.

1031
00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.013
I called Rodney.

1032
00:57:55.096 --> 00:57:59.017
and Rodney unloaded everything.

1033
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.268
He just said. "You know.

1034
00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:04.189
"I've come to appreciate
the skating more.

1035
00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:06.232
"I'm willing to take
more chances

1036
00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:10.945
and risk not winning.
and that has liberated me."

1037
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:15.325
And he said.
"Maybe that would help you."

1038
00:58:41.392 --> 00:58:44.020
When I eventually
stopped competing.

1039
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:47.065
I was like. "Oh. I have
all this freedom now."

1040
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:52.528
"I'm not beholden
to earning points

1041
00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:54.489
and staying on all the time."

1042
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.452
I had
a totally different approach

1043
00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:02.121
to what I was doing.

1044
00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.458
Started getting
much more creative.

1045
00:59:09.837 --> 00:59:11.965
Detachment.
Freedom.

1046
00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:14.801
You can breathe.

1047
00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:17.637
We skate with our hearts.

1048
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.433
And...it has its own feelings.

1049
00:59:43.663 --> 00:59:45.164
- Both Tony and Rodney

1050
00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:49.669
talk about the difficulties
of competition.

1051
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:53.339
But both of those guys
loved competing.

1052
00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:56.009
They were both killers.

1053
00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:58.678
Not just competitors. killers.

1054
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.054
They're not out to beat you.

1055
01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.348
They're out to make you afraid
to ever come to them

1056
01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.808
and compete with them again.

1057
01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.647
Tony may have had
a hard time with it.

1058
01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.608
but once he walked away
from competition.

1059
01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.068
he couldn't live without it.

1060
01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:16.154
He had to get back in.

1061
01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:24.245
- Eventually found my way
back to it

1062
01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:26.831
with a different attitude.
and I could still make it fun.

1063
01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:28.166
and I could still do it
for a living.

1064
01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:30.376
and that was it.

1065
01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.753
That was the turning point.

1066
01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:43.723
- One time
when I lived with Tony.

1067
01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.099
it was garbage day.
and I came up.

1068
01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:46.225
and he'd cleaned out
the garage.

1069
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.019
And he was dragging
this trash can

1070
01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:50.897
down the driveway.

1071
01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.148
and there was
all these trophies

1072
01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:53.441
poking out of the top.

1073
01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:55.360
Like. he did not care.

1074
01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.362
He lost his bag
of X Games medals.

1075
01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.864
I mean. he's never. ever cared.

1076
01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:00.907
I've never seen him.

1077
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.034
since I've known him
for 30 years.

1078
01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:04.369
to put any of the trophies up.

1079
01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.871
Other people will. but he's
never had a trophy room.

1080
01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:10.375
"That's just a symbol
of one point in time.

1081
01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.460
I can't get attached to that."

1082
01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:34.524
- Video was
a whole new avenue.

1083
01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.567
It's not about competition.

1084
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:39.737
That eventually outshined
all the contests.

1085
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.576
- Kids are now seeing
how to do it.

1086
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.161
When they'd look
at a magazine.

1087
01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.038
they'd see a maneuver.
but they didn't understand

1088
01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.581
how a kid got
from here to there

1089
01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:51.833
or there to here.

1090
01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:54.293
But when they saw the video.
they saw the whole thing.

1091
01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.129
So it completely
revolutionized

1092
01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.172
how kids consumed
skateboarding.

1093
01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:00.341
And it really helped
the sport grow.

1094
01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:08.558
- I was 12 years old
when I first got

1095
01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:10.351
a skateboard
and got into skateboarding.

1096
01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.645
And it was the boom
of the Bones Brigade.

1097
01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:13.938
and everybody
had a skateboard.

1098
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.482
And immediately was attracted

1099
01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:20.153
to the fun of skateboarding
through Lance Mountain

1100
01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:23.614
and the tricks in skateboarding
through Tony Hawk.

1101
01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.620
- Oh. those videos
got passed around.

1102
01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.956
I mean. people tell me
that they would rent it

1103
01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:33.666
from the shop.
give it to their friend.

1104
01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:36.002
It would break.
They'd tape it back together.

1105
01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.628
- That was
the greatest thing ever.

1106
01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:41.215
Like. I just would watch it
over and over and over.

1107
01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.342
Like. "There's gonna be
another one?

1108
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.845
What are they gonna do?
How funny is Lance gonna be?"

1109
01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:48.222
Like. you know. "What are
the new tricks like?"

1110
01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.475
Stacy was onto something. man.

1111
01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:52.894
Like. there's still
nothing cooler

1112
01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:54.562
than Bones Brigade videos.

1113
01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.635
- Animal Chin.
Have you heard of 'em?

1114
01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.303
- If you look too hard
for Animal Chin.

1115
01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:28.763
you're never gonna find 'em.

1116
01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.144
- Heard about this ramp.

1117
01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.271
It's in this field
between two junkyards.

1118
01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.570
- You know. Stacy would have
me. Mike.

1119
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.864
and Lance do our parts.

1120
01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.700
and then it was Tony's turn.

1121
01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.499
- What the hell was that?

1122
01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:03.089
- Oh!
- Insane.

1123
01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.590
- I'm like.
"Man. this guy's got

1124
01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.926
a bag of tricks
that doesn't stop."

1125
01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:16.060
540s were hard enough
grabbing.

1126
01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:19.730
but to do it
without grabbing your board...

1127
01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:23.484
- People thought it was
an impossible trick to do.

1128
01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:25.486
When people saw it.
they were like.

1129
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.113
"That's not real."

1130
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:43.462
- Tony's becoming a superstar
in skateboarding.

1131
01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:47.300
and as a result. we sold
more of his board models

1132
01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.968
pretty much every month

1133
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.845
more than anybody else
on the team.

1134
01:04:50.928 --> 01:04:54.473
We could've sold even probably
more than we sold of Tony's.

1135
01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.725
- You just didn't make enough.

1136
01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:57.518
- We couldn't make enough.

1137
01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:59.812
- By the time that I was 17.

1138
01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:02.481
I was making
at least six figures

1139
01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.774
just from skateboards.

1140
01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.109
You get very jaded

1141
01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:06.527
when that kind of money
is coming in.

1142
01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:10.239
And also. I'm not trying
to be responsible with it.

1143
01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.450
I'm not saving for the future.

1144
01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:14.452
nor am I saving for taxes.

1145
01:05:14.535 --> 01:05:17.246
And so my dad was the one

1146
01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.956
who really guided me
through that

1147
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.335
and was the one
who convinced me to buy a house

1148
01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.837
when I was still
in high school.

1149
01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.814
- Tony and his dad built
all these beautiful ramps.

1150
01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.816
I mean.
they were just unbelievable.

1151
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.777
His dad was so dedicated.

1152
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.488
- The winningest vertical
skateboard rider in history

1153
01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:52.156
now making
a very comfortable living

1154
01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:53.616
as a pro athlete.

1155
01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:56.911
- In this house. they live.
breathe. sleep. talk.

1156
01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.163
and eat skateboarding.

1157
01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:01.832
And what you're about to see
are the rewards for a guy

1158
01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:04.001
who's become top of his sport.

1159
01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:08.047
- On Sunday.
I'm signing autographs.

1160
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.716
I am flying home
with an oversized check.

1161
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.385
says $10.000.

1162
01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:15.221
I had to put it up
in the first-class closet.

1163
01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.764
And then I go home.
and I gotta wake up

1164
01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:20.559
at00 a.m. next day
and get to school.

1165
01:06:31.278 --> 01:06:34.865
- When we started
traveling around the world.

1166
01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:36.867
we started noticing
there was a lot of people

1167
01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.035
showing up to our demos.

1168
01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:40.413
and we were getting
a lot of attention.

1169
01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:45.543
- We're on the road.
and we're in our teens.

1170
01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:48.921
New city every night.
trying to meet girls.

1171
01:06:56.804 --> 01:07:01.809
- When it got big. it was
rock star time and girl time.

1172
01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:04.353
Look at the people
who didn't have ponytails.

1173
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.480
I didn't have a ponytail.
They all did.

1174
01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.566
That was a pure sign
that you're stoked.

1175
01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:09.900
that you're a rock star.

1176
01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.444
and you're gonna
get some girls.

1177
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.879
- It seemed like money
was just raining down.

1178
01:07:29.962 --> 01:07:31.881
and some of the guys
got carried away.

1179
01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:34.800
They were spending crazy.

1180
01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:38.095
At one point.
Powell sent us credit cards.

1181
01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.514
We had no idea
how credit cards worked.

1182
01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.516
so we just thought
that we could spend money

1183
01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.269
and that we wouldn't
get the bill.

1184
01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.813
We were buying cameras.
video games.

1185
01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:51.108
I think I bought
a pinball machine.

1186
01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.944
I'd be in Japan.
I would just buy boom boxes.

1187
01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:58.157
headphones. and at one point.
I bought a tanning bed.

1188
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:07.416
- From '87 to '89.

1189
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.502
it was salad days.

1190
01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:12.004
It was the heyday.
It was crazy.

1191
01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:17.676
1989. I went on tour
in the U.S. for a month.

1192
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.180
Every demo was
thousands of people.

1193
01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.682
And then we go to Europe
for six weeks.

1194
01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:25.100
Every crowd was huge.

1195
01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.394
We did a demo
at Tivoli Gardens.

1196
01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.605
The entire amusement park
stopped what they were doing

1197
01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:31.732
to watch us skate.

1198
01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:34.902
And then we'd go to Australia.
in Sydney.

1199
01:08:34.985 --> 01:08:37.404
Vert ramp right
in the middle of the city.

1200
01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.949
People were lining
the rooftops

1201
01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:42.159
because there was no more room
to watch us.

1202
01:08:43.744 --> 01:08:45.121
- He was really doing well.

1203
01:08:45.204 --> 01:08:47.873
And I was really happy for him.

1204
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:51.252
And it gave my parents
such bragging rights

1205
01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:52.461
that they couldn't--

1206
01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.256
they would stop total strangers
at the airport and say.

1207
01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:58.551
"My son is Tony Hawk.
That's no lie."

1208
01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:01.428
- So life with the alien
is good. huh?

1209
01:09:01.512 --> 01:09:03.389
- So far.
So far. so good.

1210
01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:06.058
- Well. we all wish you
many luck and happiness. and--

1211
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:09.103
- I was 22. Cindy was 24.

1212
01:09:09.186 --> 01:09:10.896
We were living together.

1213
01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.859
We decided the next stage
would be to get married.

1214
01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.027
Suddenly. I'm married.

1215
01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:19.864
I have a kid on the way.
I have two mortgages.

1216
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.825
and I was just thrust
into adulthood.

1217
01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.411
And little did I know

1218
01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:29.206
that that income
wasn't gonna last.

1219
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.585
- Skateboarding is cyclical.
It's a cyclical business.

1220
01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:37.256
It was big from '73 to '79.

1221
01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:41.510
And then from 1980 to '84.
it dipped way down.

1222
01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.429
almost disappeared.

1223
01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.472
'85. it starts to climb again.

1224
01:09:45.556 --> 01:09:48.350
and it goes all the way up
until 1990.

1225
01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.270
and then it dips again.
and it dips radically.

1226
01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.230
And when it did.

1227
01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:56.108
a lot of companies
went out of business.

1228
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.277
- I remember Stacy telling me.
"It's getting really hard

1229
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.405
to justify any expenses that
we usually put out there."

1230
01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:03.616
And I said.
"Well. what does that mean?"

1231
01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.410
And he said. "Well. I think
you'll be the last to feel it.

1232
01:10:06.493 --> 01:10:08.913
but it's coming."

1233
01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.475
Skate magazines were
going away.

1234
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:32.519
Skate brands
were barely surviving.

1235
01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.190
The skate parks closing down

1236
01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:38.067
was the last nail
in the coffin.

1237
01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:44.239
- The early '90s were
the dark years.

1238
01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:46.992
It was tough.

1239
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.786
Vertical skateboarding
was dead.

1240
01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.374
- I remember
some of the last contests.

1241
01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:54.625
and then all of a sudden.

1242
01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:56.794
there just was
no more contests.

1243
01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:01.382
It was like a rude awakening
for all of us.

1244
01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.346
- '91 was sort of the end

1245
01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.682
of the Bones Brigade era
as I knew it.

1246
01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.558
We went to go talk to Stacy.

1247
01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:14.061
and he said.
"You guys. I already left."

1248
01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:16.480
- There was kind of
this distance thing

1249
01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:18.732
between all of us
during those years.

1250
01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.859
We weren't all together
with Stacy.

1251
01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.611
and we weren't going
to contests.

1252
01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.822
and we weren't--
there was nothing.

1253
01:11:24.905 --> 01:11:27.908
All of us were thinking.
you know. "Is this it?

1254
01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.868
What we love to do
is just nothing?"

1255
01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.663
You know. we just came
from touring around the world.

1256
01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:35.332
We went to George Harrison's
house. for Pete's sake.

1257
01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:39.920
That was
an intensely tough time

1258
01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:42.715
for most of us.

1259
01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.883
- I started Birdhouse in '92.

1260
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.719
I had high hopes
that it was going

1261
01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.721
to at least be profitable
within a year or so.

1262
01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.097
and it just wasn't.

1263
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.683
And we were scraping by.

1264
01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:55.853
and there was--
there was not a bright future.

1265
01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:58.647
Riley. point to Mommy.

1266
01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.525
- Mommy.
- Yeah.

1267
01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:04.153
Where's Daddy?

1268
01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:06.196
- Cindy was becoming
the breadwinner

1269
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.406
being a manicurist.

1270
01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:11.952
Our relationship
was rocky at best.

1271
01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.121
People she works with.
it's just like.

1272
01:12:14.204 --> 01:12:16.165
"He's still trying
to skateboard?

1273
01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:18.083
"Are you fucking serious?

1274
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.752
Like. grow up. Get a job."

1275
01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:24.214
I started taking every odd job
I could.

1276
01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:28.761
I bought a video editing
system on consignment.

1277
01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:29.928
I couldn't even afford it.

1278
01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:33.098
I borrowed $5.000
from my parents to buy it.

1279
01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.642
- He's chugging this OJ.

1280
01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.186
When I moved in with Tony.

1281
01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:39.772
we were both super.
super broke.

1282
01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.357
But I think we were like.
"We'll just keep. you know.

1283
01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:45.444
"adjusting our lifestyle
lower and lower

1284
01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.404
until we get
to that crisis point."

1285
01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:50.074
- We had a water bill
at the time

1286
01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:53.452
that I had to go
down to the city

1287
01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.454
and ask to make payments on.

1288
01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:59.083
And they allowed me
to pay it off over six months.

1289
01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:02.169
I would look around
and it'd be like...

1290
01:13:02.252 --> 01:13:03.587
you know. there's a pool

1291
01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:07.257
and there's a propane tank
that I got to pay to fill.

1292
01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:08.634
and then there's
this huge ramp

1293
01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.302
that was
starting to fall apart

1294
01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:12.346
that I couldn't afford to fix.

1295
01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:14.181
And that's
when reality sunk in.

1296
01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.353
I sold the house.

1297
01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:22.773
I had to tear down
this monstrous ramp.

1298
01:13:22.856 --> 01:13:25.901
Pulling out screws.
pulling off plies.

1299
01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:30.280
cutting chunks out of it
and kicking them over the side.

1300
01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:31.907
And to what end?

1301
01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:38.080
You're just dismantling
your career until it's gone.

1302
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.047
- How did you handle stress
back then?

1303
01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.134
- I don't even--

1304
01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:51.677
how did I handle stress
back then?

1305
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.887
I think that I would go skate.

1306
01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:57.724
I mean. that was it.

1307
01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:00.185
That's been my--

1308
01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.229
That's been my escape. always.

1309
01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:05.190
But it was meager.

1310
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.025
And it wasn't
what it used to be.

1311
01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.944
So it was like.

1312
01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:10.320
"Why are you spending
all your energy?

1313
01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:11.864
Why are you killing yourself
out there?"

1314
01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:31.383
- I hired him to help me
with a little video

1315
01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:34.094
for the shop or something
that I was trying to do.

1316
01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:36.430
He was. you know.
scrambling around.

1317
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:39.725
but he still
pushed himself skating.

1318
01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:50.360
- I never considered
quitting skating as an option.

1319
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:51.904
I was always gonna
find time to skate.

1320
01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.577
- Yeah!

1321
01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.421
I don't think I could estimate
how many 540s I've done.

1322
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.923
It's just--

1323
01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.633
- Like. over...

1324
01:15:12.716 --> 01:15:16.511
- 10.000.
For sure. I--

1325
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.765
let's just say. for instance.
300 in a summer.

1326
01:15:22.392 --> 01:15:24.478
- 400. 500 a year. Yeah.

1327
01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:28.190
I mean. I was--like.
thousands. tens of thousands.

1328
01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:29.983
When people say you put in
your 10.000 hours.

1329
01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:31.735
I put in my 10.000 McTwists.

1330
01:16:08.188 --> 01:16:10.732
I first thought
about the possibility of 900s

1331
01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:13.485
after learning 720s in 1985.

1332
01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.947
I didn't actually have
the nerve to try it

1333
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:20.158
until 1987
at a skate camp in France.

1334
01:16:22.202 --> 01:16:24.788
I ended up trying it
a few times.

1335
01:16:24.871 --> 01:16:28.000
I didn't understand
where I was in the air

1336
01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:32.004
and ended up landing
on my back twice.

1337
01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:35.966
I wasn't ready to commit
to that spin.

1338
01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:37.676
- We had a lot
of other skaters

1339
01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:38.969
chasing the 900.

1340
01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:41.388
and just because it had been
going on for so long.

1341
01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:42.514
which no other trick had.

1342
01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:45.726
it kind of got some. like.
holy grail aspect to it

1343
01:16:45.809 --> 01:16:48.020
that I've never seen
any other trick

1344
01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.896
treated like that
with the skate community.

1345
01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:59.489
It became a trick that
a lot of people are trying.

1346
01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.241
Everyone kept getting
a little close.

1347
01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:02.326
Like. they could spin.

1348
01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:03.827
but then they'd land
and keep whipping out.

1349
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.038
There was always--
you would be close enough

1350
01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.205
to kind of taste it.

1351
01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.999
but there'd be one--
something missing

1352
01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:12.544
that would make it totally
almost impossible to land.

1353
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:19.551
- There were a couple times
in my pursuit of doing a 900

1354
01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:23.055
that I really was
done with it.

1355
01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:26.224
The first time I tried
to really make one.

1356
01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.727
I was leaning forward too far.
and I broke my rib

1357
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.730
when I--like. I just fell
into the flat bottom.

1358
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:36.860
That was at a time
when I wasn't really making

1359
01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:39.071
a good living skating.

1360
01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:41.531
I'll never forget that day.
because I was trying it--

1361
01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:44.910
my son Riley.
he was in kindergarten.

1362
01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:47.371
I was late to pick him up
to kindergarten

1363
01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:49.581
'cause I was stuck trying
this trick on the ramp.

1364
01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:51.666
I broke my rib trying it.

1365
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.627
but I still had to get there
to pick him up.

1366
01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.714
It was a moment in life
where it was like.

1367
01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.800
"What am I doing?"

1368
01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.725
"I just can't do it."

1369
01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:20.237
- They'd been trying it
for so long. right?

1370
01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.740
I think it was almost 12 years.

1371
01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.076
- You ever not committed
to a landing on a trick

1372
01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:27.494
before in your life?

1373
01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:32.040
- That's a good question.

1374
01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:36.628
I had never gotten so close
to a trick and given up on it.

1375
01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.130
Never.

1376
01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.298
Someone's got to do this.

1377
01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.509
Someone's got to break
through this boundary.

1378
01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.911
- When he's going
after a trick.

1379
01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:52.662
you can watch him
get closer and closer.

1380
01:19:52.746 --> 01:19:54.998
'cause he's making little
adjustments in his head.

1381
01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.267
- When he knows
he's getting close.

1382
01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:17.270
he does not give up on a trick
unless his body breaks.

1383
01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:20.148
He'll just throw himself
and slam. slam. slam. slam.

1384
01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.865
- The 900
was a little different.

1385
01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:31.701
'cause that really trashes
your body super quick.

1386
01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:45.757
- I still don't get it. man.

1387
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.969
I don't know how Tony can keep
spinning it and keep his mind.

1388
01:20:49.052 --> 01:20:52.847
Like. it's got to make you
fuckin' freak out.

1389
01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:56.601
Like. a 720.
And then the 900? Like. how?

1390
01:20:56.685 --> 01:21:00.146
It's too hard.
It's just too much spinning.

1391
01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:04.150
- He tried to do it
in a bullring in Tijuana.

1392
01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:06.736
And he had another attempt

1393
01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.698
where I thought
it was gonna kill him.

1394
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:12.367
His pursuit of that
was personal.

1395
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.369
but it was also at a time
when skateboarding

1396
01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:18.081
was just kind of coming back up
into being popular again.

1397
01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:19.916
- Well. the X Games gave him

1398
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.502
the biggest platform
he's ever had.

1399
01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.796
- I heard ESPN was
gonna do an event

1400
01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.131
and include skateboarding.

1401
01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:29.175
I was like. "Skateboarding
is gonna be on ESPN.

1402
01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:30.760
That means something."

1403
01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:32.971
I was hyped. 'cause I had
never quit skating vert.

1404
01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:36.224
- The technical difficulty
is just immense.

1405
01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:37.809
and this guy pulls it off

1406
01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.978
as if he's going
for a walk through the park.

1407
01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:42.272
- I was there
for the first X Games.

1408
01:21:42.355 --> 01:21:43.732
I was there
for "The Tony Hawk Show."

1409
01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.568
as all the other skaters
called it.

1410
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:49.321
He won the vert contest.
He won the street contest.

1411
01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:50.530
- Tony Hawk.

1412
01:21:50.614 --> 01:21:52.115
- After the first X Games.

1413
01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:54.659
there was a little bit
more interest.

1414
01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.661
It raised the bar
a little bit.

1415
01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:01.124
And then when the second
X Games came around.

1416
01:22:01.207 --> 01:22:03.335
that's when you could tell
something was happening.

1417
01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.170
- Riley Hawk.

1418
01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:08.006
His father has
locked up the gold medal.

1419
01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.680
- He is going huge.

1420
01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:22.187
Gymnastics has its Nadia.
but skateboarding has Hawk.

1421
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.689
- Nobody else skates
like Tony Hawk.

1422
01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.107
- He is a hero.

1423
01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.776
- Tony Hawk.
the best skateboarder

1424
01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:29.402
the sport has ever seen.
- Tony Hawk.

1425
01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:32.280
That is the best
skateboarder in the world.

1426
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.164
- Hi. Dad.

1427
01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:43.166
I know that we don't get
to talk too much

1428
01:22:43.249 --> 01:22:44.334
about what you do around here.

1429
01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.544
but I just want you to know
that I appreciate it.

1430
01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:51.466
and...that we just thought
that we'd make a video

1431
01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:54.678
saying thanks
for all the great stuff.

1432
01:22:56.346 --> 01:23:00.767
My siblings and my mom and I
had steeled ourself.

1433
01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:03.603
ready for him to have
a heart attack at any minute.

1434
01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:05.814
because he just didn't
take care of himself.

1435
01:23:05.897 --> 01:23:07.816
And it was like.
that's what's gonna happen.

1436
01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:12.654
And we all almost were all
waiting for that to happen.

1437
01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:14.406
So we all had prepared
ourselves for that.

1438
01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:17.033
and then one day.

1439
01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:19.869
he finds out
he has lung cancer.

1440
01:23:19.953 --> 01:23:22.706
He was in his final stages.

1441
01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:26.209
super rail thin. stuck in bed.

1442
01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:28.253
I went on this tour in Europe.

1443
01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:31.297
and I just felt weird
about being there.

1444
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:34.426
'cause I knew
that he was degrading rapidly.

1445
01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.469
so I came home early
from the tour.

1446
01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:39.139
And he said.
"You have to do your thing.

1447
01:23:39.222 --> 01:23:41.349
You can't just sit here
and watch me die."

1448
01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:44.894
For the most part.
sent me to Woodward.

1449
01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:47.605
I heard a call
over the intercom.

1450
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.567
"Tony Hawk. will you please
pick up the phone?"

1451
01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:53.403
When my mom called me
at Woodward.

1452
01:23:53.486 --> 01:23:55.405
she just broke down crying
and just said.

1453
01:23:55.488 --> 01:23:57.991
"He loved you so much."

1454
01:23:58.074 --> 01:23:59.325
And that was the first time

1455
01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:02.579
she really got emotional
about my dad.

1456
01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:43.620
- It's a very unique sport.

1457
01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:45.330
It's the only sport
in the world I know

1458
01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:47.624
where competitors--
I've watched 'em in the middle

1459
01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:50.043
of heavy competition
encouraging each other.

1460
01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.798
And earnestly
encouraging each other.

1461
01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:57.175
Not many competitions do that.

1462
01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.968
- So you think
it's a good sport?

1463
01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.012
- Oh. yeah.
Yeah. Definitely.

1464
01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:03.181
And I'd like to see it
continue as a sport.

1465
01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.560
- I can guarantee you

1466
01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:09.813
that every single one
of those skateboarders today

1467
01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:11.356
would look back on him fondly.

1468
01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.191
Guarantee it.

1469
01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:14.859
I guarantee it.

1470
01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:17.862
- His dad was like
a second dad to me.

1471
01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:21.324
Like. he was just
an amazing person.

1472
01:25:21.407 --> 01:25:24.702
- I could only imagine.
you know. my family

1473
01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.704
doing what his family
did for him. you know?

1474
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.790
Like. I would dream about that.

1475
01:25:28.873 --> 01:25:30.416
Like. "Wow. what would
that be like?

1476
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.252
Nah. my dad
would never do that."

1477
01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:41.177
- Tony had me do something
right when his dad died.

1478
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:44.055
and I was talking shit
at that thing.

1479
01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:49.227
I think I said something
real stupid in an interview.

1480
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:52.647
"Glad he's gone."
or something fucked up.

1481
01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:55.733
X Games. he's up there riding.

1482
01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:58.361
My son just died ten days ago.

1483
01:25:58.444 --> 01:25:59.696
He's got me.

1484
01:25:59.779 --> 01:26:01.656
So I get up there
and I'm like--

1485
01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.741
and the first thing I said was.

1486
01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:05.326
"Got me now. motherfucker.

1487
01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:06.828
What are you gonna say?"

1488
01:26:06.911 --> 01:26:11.749
And then he goes. "Duane.
I'm super sorry about Chess."

1489
01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.210
I fucking--I mean...

1490
01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:18.756
And he goes.
"You got a minute?"

1491
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.633
'Cause cameras are on this guy

1492
01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:22.802
every-fucking-where he goes.

1493
01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:26.097
So it's like.
we go down to some. like. area

1494
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.975
and fucking away from--
and just total

1495
01:26:29.058 --> 01:26:32.979
personal fucking cool--
like. what the fuck?

1496
01:26:33.062 --> 01:26:35.607
What a cool--I didn't--
you know.

1497
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.066
I didn't expect that.

1498
01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:38.568
That was nice.

1499
01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:40.570
And I was really blown away.

1500
01:26:40.653 --> 01:26:42.864
Like. my kid
fucking looked up to him.

1501
01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:45.825
and I let him know that.

1502
01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.995
You know?
"He looked up to you. man."

1503
01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:53.708
So I look at things

1504
01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:56.294
totally fucking different.
you know?

1505
01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:58.755
And...

1506
01:26:58.838 --> 01:27:02.508
you know...

1507
01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:06.512
when his--his dad died

1508
01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:08.723
and I said that in the--

1509
01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:14.270
'Cause it was just me and him.

1510
01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:16.898
And. you know.
that's how life works.

1511
01:27:16.981 --> 01:27:19.025
It's a fucking weird game.

1512
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.446
And all that
baton twirling shit.

1513
01:27:23.529 --> 01:27:26.324
he fucking stepped it up
for all of us.

1514
01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:27.575
All that fucking shit--

1515
01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:30.620
you know how much time it takes
to learn tricks like that?

1516
01:27:33.164 --> 01:27:34.832
- Okay. everybody.

1517
01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.335
We want to hear everybody
in the house right now.

1518
01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:38.670
Boys. girls.

1519
01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.463
ladies. and gentlemen.

1520
01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:41.673
wrapping up

1521
01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:42.674
our Best Tricks contest.

1522
01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:43.675
But don't forget.

1523
01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.134
you're gonna pick the winner.

1524
01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:47.512
Right now.
Tony's got a shot at it.

1525
01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.973
Can he do it?
Let's see it.

1526
01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:54.477
- Yeah.

1527
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.314
900. try not to--look at him
focused out here.

1528
01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:01.526
- We love you. crowd!
We love you!

1529
01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.611
- Yeah.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

1530
01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:06.364
900! 900!

1531
01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:08.116
This could be it.

1532
01:28:08.199 --> 01:28:09.450
Oh!

1533
01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:12.203
- Oh. the closest one!

1534
01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:14.539
- There was always
one or two really small things

1535
01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:17.041
that made the 9
almost impossible to land.

1536
01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.711
And I think one
of those things clicked there.

1537
01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:22.422
and he went.
"I'm--I actually felt better

1538
01:28:22.505 --> 01:28:24.048
"than I've ever felt
spinning that 9.

1539
01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:26.009
so I'm not gonna stop."

1540
01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:27.969
- You guys. you guys
want to see one more?

1541
01:28:28.052 --> 01:28:29.721
Tony Hawk coming close.

1542
01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:30.888
- Here we go. folks.

1543
01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.057
- History in the making.

1544
01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.351
Who wouldn't want
to be right here?

1545
01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:36.978
Making history.

1546
01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:40.064
Never. ever been done before
on the skateboard.

1547
01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.191
He's coming close.

1548
01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:44.318
Yeah. here we go.
900!

1549
01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:46.404
900!

1550
01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:52.869
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1551
01:28:52.952 --> 01:28:56.080
- Oh. baby!

1552
01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:57.665
All right. stomp your feet!

1553
01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.620
- You saw him going inward
more and more and more

1554
01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:38.122
each and every time.
and you knew--or I knew.

1555
01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:42.001
watching. like.
he really isn't gonna stop.

1556
01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:44.170
And I had been there
when he'd only stopped before

1557
01:29:44.253 --> 01:29:46.297
'cause he broke a rib.

1558
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.634
- He just said. "I'm either
gonna make this trick.

1559
01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:52.303
"or someone's gonna
take me off in a stretcher.

1560
01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:53.763
That's how it's gonna go."

1561
01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:03.648
all: Tony! Tony! Tony!

1562
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.883
all: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

1563
01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:35.054
- It was almost as if his mind
was going...

1564
01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.685
You know. squishing down
further and further.

1565
01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:43.229
And you can just see...

1566
01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:46.107
how much intensity
it took from him.

1567
01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.987
- 9! 9! 9! 9!

1568
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:53.364
9! 9!

1569
01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:55.867
There it is!

1570
01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.375
- This is important
to this guy.

1571
01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.669
He's focused.
He is prepped.

1572
01:31:06.752 --> 01:31:08.254
This is history in the making.

1573
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:16.679
9! 9!
Tony Hawk!

1574
01:31:16.762 --> 01:31:20.516
Tony Hawk!
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1575
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.518
900!

1576
01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:25.897
900!

1577
01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:29.442
Oh!
So close.

1578
01:31:29.525 --> 01:31:32.945
The closest I've ever
seen anyone before.

1579
01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:40.036
Ooh. what is going on in 1999
in vertical skateboard history?

1580
01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:42.747
- We got Andy.

1581
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.707
- All this energy.
These guys are going on.

1582
01:31:50.713 --> 01:31:52.465
Everybody picture it.
Here we go.

1583
01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:04.435
- Yeah!
- Oh!

1584
01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.687
Are you kidding me?

1585
01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.607
Yeah!
Look at this!

1586
01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.985
Tony Hawk. everybody!

1587
01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.737
Yeah!
Look at this!

1588
01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:55.027
- I've never seen Tony

1589
01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:58.614
explosively emotional
like that.

1590
01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:01.450
Says a lot about that sense

1591
01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:04.120
of what he found out
about himself

1592
01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:06.205
by making himself
do that trick.

1593
01:33:07.373 --> 01:33:10.501
- It had nothing to do
with the physical motions

1594
01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:11.502
of that trick.

1595
01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.546
It was all here.

1596
01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:19.844
- It's just a trick.

1597
01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:22.888
But to me. the ones that make
the most difference

1598
01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:25.516
in who I am as a man.

1599
01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:28.060
as a person...

1600
01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:29.812
is when you've redlined it
so much

1601
01:33:29.895 --> 01:33:32.148
that you did something
that you didn't know

1602
01:33:32.231 --> 01:33:34.150
if you had it in you to do it.

1603
01:33:34.233 --> 01:33:37.403
That's a different
kind of proving ground.

1604
01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:41.198
That shifts something
within you.

1605
01:33:46.996 --> 01:33:51.250
- I could feel
the thrill that I got

1606
01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:53.544
from anything I've done
through him.

1607
01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:55.212
It was huge.

1608
01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:59.884
Like. I was so excited
to see him do that.

1609
01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:02.970
So excited and happy for him.

1610
01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:05.222
You know. I just knew
what was going on.

1611
01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:09.060
Like. I've never reached that.

1612
01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.770
because I'll never do a 900.

1613
01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:12.271
But I've reached it
in other things.

1614
01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:15.191
And just the feel of that
and the win of that

1615
01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:17.693
and the--it's just rad.

1616
01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:18.861
It's huge.

1617
01:34:18.944 --> 01:34:21.405
It's so--it's killer.
It's so good.

1618
01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:26.327
- Sean Mortimer called me up.
like. two minutes

1619
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:28.662
after he landed it
from the ramp and said.

1620
01:34:28.746 --> 01:34:31.040
"Your brother just landed a 9!

1621
01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:34.043
It's like a war ended!"

1622
01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:38.881
The thing I love about the 900

1623
01:34:38.964 --> 01:34:41.675
that doesn't get talked about
much was that...

1624
01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:44.220
that moment is kind of
in sports history.

1625
01:34:44.303 --> 01:34:46.263
which really was a moment
in sports history.

1626
01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.474
could only have happened
in skateboarding.

1627
01:34:48.557 --> 01:34:51.894
because any other sport.

1628
01:34:51.977 --> 01:34:54.105
the clock ran out.

1629
01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.439
It was done.

1630
01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:56.899
Like. that wouldn't
have happened

1631
01:34:56.982 --> 01:34:58.651
if they'd had skateboarding
in the Olympics.

1632
01:34:58.734 --> 01:35:00.277
'cause you know.
once the clock ran out.

1633
01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:03.239
they would have run up
and chained up the ramp

1634
01:35:03.322 --> 01:35:05.491
and said. "Okay. we're done."
But the--

1635
01:35:05.574 --> 01:35:08.077
- The irony is. if your dad
was running the--

1636
01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.370
- Oh. my God.

1637
01:35:09.453 --> 01:35:10.621
You know.
that just occurred to me.

1638
01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:11.997
If my dad had been
running the show.

1639
01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:13.916
it wouldn't have happened.

1640
01:35:13.999 --> 01:35:16.961
Fuck.
That just occurred to me.

1641
01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:22.466
- I wish my dad had been able
to see the recognition

1642
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.260
and the appreciation
that skateboarding got

1643
01:35:24.343 --> 01:35:26.470
after '99. 2000.

1644
01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.639
Even in his wildest dreams.

1645
01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:31.642
he thought that skateboard
contests would be bigger.

1646
01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:34.353
but he would have
never imagined

1647
01:35:34.437 --> 01:35:36.605
that it blew up the way it did.

1648
01:35:38.107 --> 01:35:40.317
- Las Vegas.
put your hands together

1649
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:43.320
for the Boom Boom HuckJam!

1650
01:35:57.877 --> 01:36:00.546
- Whoo-hoo!

1651
01:36:09.472 --> 01:36:12.266
- Suddenly.
we were rock stars again.

1652
01:36:12.349 --> 01:36:15.186
but on a completely
different level.

1653
01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:21.066
Performing in arenas.
selling out night after night.

1654
01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:22.651
We had a setup
that filled an arena floor.

1655
01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:24.820
We were way bigger
than a rock tour.

1656
01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:26.489
We filled
the entire arena floor

1657
01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:29.283
with ramps and lights.
pyrotechnics.

1658
01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.038
- It was high-pressure
skateboarding.

1659
01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:35.956
It was like.
you have to make this trick.

1660
01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.625
or a motorcycle
could land on you.

1661
01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:43.589
- I can remember watching
the Boom Boom HuckJam.

1662
01:36:43.672 --> 01:36:47.593
and other ladies my age were--
just couldn't watch.

1663
01:36:47.676 --> 01:36:49.011
Their hands were
over their face.

1664
01:36:49.094 --> 01:36:51.096
and they were just terrified.

1665
01:36:56.852 --> 01:36:58.229
- Every night was a new city.

1666
01:36:58.312 --> 01:37:01.565
They would put a piece of tape
on the deck of the ramp.

1667
01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.025
When they handed you
the microphone.

1668
01:37:03.108 --> 01:37:04.652
you could glance down
at that tape

1669
01:37:04.735 --> 01:37:06.529
so you didn't go...

1670
01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:09.156
"Thank you. Philadelphia."
and you're really in Chicago.

1671
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:12.117
- Living in the lap of luxury.

1672
01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:15.079
Like. people were providing
for us at every turn.

1673
01:37:17.289 --> 01:37:20.292
Flying in and out of the tour
on Tony's private jet.

1674
01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:22.253
staying in these great hotels.

1675
01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:26.173
- It's all younger dudes.
mostly single.

1676
01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:29.093
And it was just like.
the world is yours.

1677
01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:30.970
You guys are. you know.
Led Zeppelin tonight.

1678
01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.434
- "Come on. Tony. let's go!
We got this club downtown."

1679
01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:40.062
Like. the tour manager
would call ahead and be like.

1680
01:37:40.145 --> 01:37:43.399
"Hey. we got Tony Hawk coming.
Make sure the door's open."

1681
01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:53.117
- There's a part of that
where it's like.

1682
01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.245
"Okay. so now what?
So now you're a rock star?

1683
01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:59.290
So now you have
all this excess?"

1684
01:38:04.795 --> 01:38:07.798
- You know. Activision came
to him to do the video game.

1685
01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.258
and it was the best company.

1686
01:38:09.341 --> 01:38:10.634
and they had
the best developer.

1687
01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:13.137
and. you know. he was hands-on.

1688
01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:20.311
- They developed this game
that he never thought

1689
01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:24.064
was gonna be particularly
popular amongst everybody.

1690
01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:26.609
He thought skaters
would like it.

1691
01:38:26.692 --> 01:38:28.611
- When the fourth game
was released.

1692
01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:30.863
the first three were still
in the top ten of sales.

1693
01:38:30.946 --> 01:38:33.490
And Activision called
a meeting with me.

1694
01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.492
I went and met one of the guys
I worked with.

1695
01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:37.494
I met him for lunch.
and he said--

1696
01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:38.996
he explained to me
what was happening.

1697
01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.623
He's like. "Well.
this is in the top sales.

1698
01:38:40.706 --> 01:38:41.790
and now it's a best hit."

1699
01:38:41.874 --> 01:38:42.791
I go. "What does that mean?"

1700
01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:44.168
He goes.
"This is what it means."

1701
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:47.504
and he hands me a check
for $4.5 million.

1702
01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.674
And I was like. "Oh. my God."

1703
01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:52.343
And then two years later.

1704
01:38:52.426 --> 01:38:54.553
they gave me an advance
of $20 million.

1705
01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:57.765
- Tony was getting recognized
everywhere.

1706
01:38:57.848 --> 01:39:00.184
He was the face
of skateboarding.

1707
01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:02.895
- I never got into
skateboarding to be famous.

1708
01:39:02.978 --> 01:39:04.855
I never thought I'd be famous.

1709
01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.899
And then I was famous.
and I was like.

1710
01:39:06.982 --> 01:39:08.817
"Well. I'm famous now.

1711
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:12.154
I guess I'm supposed to do
all this stuff."

1712
01:39:12.237 --> 01:39:15.407
But it's the worst drug.

1713
01:39:15.491 --> 01:39:16.533
It's the worst drug.

1714
01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:17.618
- You got to let him go.

1715
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:18.911
Come on. let him go through.

1716
01:39:18.994 --> 01:39:20.204
- And it's so easy
to fall into.

1717
01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:21.997
It's crazy.

1718
01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:23.666
There was infidelity.

1719
01:39:23.749 --> 01:39:27.419
lying to myself
about justification.

1720
01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:29.380
you know. not being honest
with others.

1721
01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:31.423
not being honest with myself.

1722
01:39:31.507 --> 01:39:33.133
A lot of other things

1723
01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:34.843
that should have taken
priority in my life.

1724
01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:37.930
especially my kids.
fell by the wayside.

1725
01:39:38.013 --> 01:39:40.516
I had issues
with intimacy already.

1726
01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:44.144
and then I'm in
this crazy scenario.

1727
01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:45.521
I didn't like myself.

1728
01:39:45.604 --> 01:39:48.023
I didn't like
the choices I was making.

1729
01:39:48.107 --> 01:39:51.360
And that started to spiral
worse and worse.

1730
01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:52.653
I'm gonna distract over here.

1731
01:39:52.736 --> 01:39:54.029
I'm gonna anesthetize
with this.

1732
01:39:54.113 --> 01:39:56.573
And it was just like.
"What's wrong with you?

1733
01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.534
Why can't you just be content?"

1734
01:40:02.037 --> 01:40:03.956
People aren't even happy
at home to see me.

1735
01:40:04.039 --> 01:40:06.542
Everyone's happy
to see me out on the road.

1736
01:40:06.625 --> 01:40:09.378
They welcome me.

1737
01:40:09.461 --> 01:40:10.421
"New York Times"
wants to talk to me.

1738
01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:11.422
I gotta go do that.

1739
01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.924
I gotta fly here
for this charity event.

1740
01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:15.259
'cause they invited me.

1741
01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:16.719
There's a movie premiere.
They want me.

1742
01:40:16.802 --> 01:40:18.095
I gotta be on the red carpet.

1743
01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:19.596
Well. of course I gotta go to--

1744
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.767
I gotta go to Monaco
for the "Sports Awards"...

1745
01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.936
that I'm not even
nominated for.

1746
01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:31.066
And then I'd be there
and at some point back alone

1747
01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:34.695
and just thinking.
"Why aren't you just home?"

1748
01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:43.787
- The whole concept of. like.
yeah. people asking me. like.

1749
01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.248
"What's it like
to have your dad be Tony Hawk?"

1750
01:40:46.331 --> 01:40:47.541
It's like.
it's the only thing I know.

1751
01:40:47.624 --> 01:40:49.918
so I don't know
what it's not like.

1752
01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:54.798
- Riley was with me through
all of my relationships

1753
01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:58.510
and challenges and turmoil.

1754
01:40:58.594 --> 01:41:00.763
Riley had a rough upbringing

1755
01:41:00.846 --> 01:41:04.433
with a lot
of different co-parents

1756
01:41:04.516 --> 01:41:06.477
and half siblings.

1757
01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.979
And he just
went along with it.

1758
01:41:09.062 --> 01:41:11.440
'cause he didn't--obviously.
he didn't have a choice.

1759
01:41:11.523 --> 01:41:13.275
- It definitely was tricky
being the oldest

1760
01:41:13.358 --> 01:41:15.486
of two families

1761
01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:17.154
and two separate sets
of siblings.

1762
01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:18.906
because you're just kind of.
like--

1763
01:41:18.989 --> 01:41:21.867
I was the only one doing this.

1764
01:41:23.368 --> 01:41:25.078
- We were on tour once.

1765
01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:27.790
and I should have really
just enjoyed that aspect.

1766
01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:29.958
Like.
"Oh. Riley's here on tour."

1767
01:41:30.042 --> 01:41:31.293
And I remember him
looking at me like.

1768
01:41:31.376 --> 01:41:34.713
"Are you gonna go out
again tonight?"

1769
01:41:34.797 --> 01:41:36.381
And I was thinking. like.
"Aw. well.

1770
01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:38.050
you're just gonna fall asleep.
It's okay."

1771
01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:39.468
Like. "Someone will be
in the room with you.

1772
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:40.844
It'll be all right."

1773
01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:43.180
And. like. I think back
to those times. like.

1774
01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:45.057
"You should have
taken that as a sign."

1775
01:41:47.476 --> 01:41:50.354
My other kids.
they only saw one relationship

1776
01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:51.688
or two relationships.

1777
01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:53.982
And they're like.
"Oh. this is your pattern.

1778
01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:55.901
This is what you do."

1779
01:41:55.984 --> 01:41:57.861
I didn't know how to live
in my own skin.

1780
01:41:57.945 --> 01:42:01.698
I didn't know how to--
how to like myself.

1781
01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:04.743
And I didn't know how to...

1782
01:42:04.827 --> 01:42:08.539
be a husband or a father

1783
01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.874
that I would be proud of.

1784
01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:18.006
Chef has arrived.

1785
01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:26.515
So scary that you cut
towards your fingers.

1786
01:42:26.598 --> 01:42:28.016
- No.

1787
01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:31.645
- It's scary to me
as the adult figure

1788
01:42:31.728 --> 01:42:32.896
and the one that's supposed
to be responsible

1789
01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.022
for your safety.

1790
01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:36.191
That frightens me.
- This frightens you?

1791
01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:37.526
- Yes.

1792
01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:43.365
- No. but come down here.

1793
01:42:43.448 --> 01:42:45.659
- Are you guys pretending
like you guys cook?

1794
01:42:45.742 --> 01:42:48.704
- Oh!
- He took the trash out. too.

1795
01:42:48.787 --> 01:42:51.206
And he went
to the grocery store.

1796
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:52.875
- I am a hunter and gatherer.

1797
01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:55.794
I hunt and gather income
by riding a skateboard.

1798
01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:58.881
- When I met Tony.

1799
01:42:58.964 --> 01:43:00.924
there was just something
very comfortable

1800
01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.467
about being around him.

1801
01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:04.177
Like. kind of like
when you meet somebody

1802
01:43:04.261 --> 01:43:08.140
that you feel like you've known
kind of feeling.

1803
01:43:08.223 --> 01:43:10.475
You're just the worst.
He's the worst.

1804
01:43:10.559 --> 01:43:12.144
- Oh. my God. he just--
- He's the worst.

1805
01:43:12.227 --> 01:43:14.187
- He's the worst.

1806
01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:16.732
- When Cathy and I found

1807
01:43:16.815 --> 01:43:19.318
that there could be
this chance of romance.

1808
01:43:19.401 --> 01:43:24.156
I knew deep down
I had not figured out my life.

1809
01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:26.241
Like. I had not figured out
how to function

1810
01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:28.118
in a committed relationship.

1811
01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:30.454
and I carried all this baggage.

1812
01:43:30.537 --> 01:43:34.124
And I didn't think
she knew the depths of it.

1813
01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:36.877
- He didn't know how to...

1814
01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:41.214
Express his real.
true feelings.

1815
01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:46.553
There's just some holes there
that he filled

1816
01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:48.138
with skateboarding.

1817
01:43:48.221 --> 01:43:50.515
And skateboarding fed so much

1818
01:43:50.599 --> 01:43:53.060
of what he was lacking

1819
01:43:53.143 --> 01:43:54.811
that I don't know
if he developed

1820
01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:57.147
how to get those things
other ways.

1821
01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:00.734
Even the relationship with his
parents was around skating.

1822
01:44:00.817 --> 01:44:04.613
Everything was around skating.

1823
01:44:04.696 --> 01:44:06.490
- I had to go make a change.
Like. I just knew it.

1824
01:44:06.573 --> 01:44:08.659
I knew I wasn't capable
of doing it myself.

1825
01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:12.245
Checked into a place.

1826
01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:14.915
And...it was hard.

1827
01:44:14.998 --> 01:44:16.250
It was super hard.

1828
01:44:18.168 --> 01:44:19.962
And where do you even start?

1829
01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.840
There's a skate park downtown.

1830
01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:28.053
I was at that skate park
at00 a.m. every single day.

1831
01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:31.181
I made a special request
to be able to do that.

1832
01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:35.268
There was ice on the ground.

1833
01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:38.146
There was snow
covering the coping sometimes.

1834
01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:40.816
I would go out there
in snow gloves

1835
01:44:40.899 --> 01:44:43.694
and session for at least
an hour by myself.

1836
01:44:47.906 --> 01:44:50.659
What I realized
is that I've had

1837
01:44:50.742 --> 01:44:55.080
the most intense discipline
in my life with skating.

1838
01:44:55.163 --> 01:44:59.418
If I can--if I can focus
that discipline on my life...

1839
01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:03.714
I must have it in there.
I must be able to do that.

1840
01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:06.383
- He said.
"I know I can do this.

1841
01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:08.427
"because these are
the qualities I have.

1842
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:12.097
"I am determined.
I'm disciplined.

1843
01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:14.891
and I know I can make
all these changes in myself."

1844
01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:18.061
Because he has the example
of doing it in skating.

1845
01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:20.188
- I knew that

1846
01:45:20.272 --> 01:45:24.234
I was going to do
everything necessary

1847
01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:27.529
and stick with it
and lean into it

1848
01:45:27.612 --> 01:45:30.532
and wrote this ugly list
of things I wasn't proud of.

1849
01:45:30.615 --> 01:45:32.701
and...

1850
01:45:32.784 --> 01:45:34.161
that probably was the moment

1851
01:45:34.244 --> 01:45:38.707
where I was most in shock
and just was like.

1852
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:40.709
"This is the end of that."

1853
01:45:42.252 --> 01:45:45.756
I released this baggage.

1854
01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:49.760
and I felt like
I finally have a foundation

1855
01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:54.431
to fill up
with a positive way of living.

1856
01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:58.727
Me coming to terms with it was
balling up this list

1857
01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:00.020
and throwing it in the fire.

1858
01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:06.234
- Do you need any help?
- Yes.

1859
01:46:07.736 --> 01:46:09.071
Can you help me get youth?

1860
01:46:09.154 --> 01:46:10.739
- No.
- Why not?

1861
01:46:10.822 --> 01:46:12.240
You have so much of it.

1862
01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:14.910
- He's probably
at the point in his life

1863
01:46:14.993 --> 01:46:18.121
where he's probably
happiest with himself

1864
01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.581
and happiest
in his relationship.

1865
01:46:19.664 --> 01:46:21.625
And I think. ultimately.
that has the biggest effect

1866
01:46:21.708 --> 01:46:23.460
on your relationship
to your children.

1867
01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:27.005
And so I'm happy that he was
able to get to that point.

1868
01:46:27.089 --> 01:46:30.008
And now he has Kady
that he can.

1869
01:46:30.092 --> 01:46:32.135
you know. be that parent to.

1870
01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:35.013
And I think he's the best form
of himself now.

1871
01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:37.349
- Can you stand up?

1872
01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.143
- Oh. my God.

1873
01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:43.563
- Oh. you did it!

1874
01:46:43.647 --> 01:46:44.940
That's the first time
I've seen you do it.

1875
01:46:49.319 --> 01:46:51.279
- Rodney Mullen
goes to his warehouse

1876
01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:52.864
and skates every night.

1877
01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:55.700
Lance is still waking up
every day and skating.

1878
01:46:55.784 --> 01:46:58.120
Steve Caballero's
still considering himself

1879
01:46:58.203 --> 01:46:59.496
a pro skater.

1880
01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:01.456
Mike McGill still skates.
and obviously.

1881
01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.210
Tony is skating all the time
at the highest level.

1882
01:47:05.293 --> 01:47:07.504
- There's a difference.
though. in some of those guys.

1883
01:47:07.587 --> 01:47:08.922
Rodney Mullen...

1884
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:12.342
Skateboarding for him. I think.

1885
01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:15.804
is really an art form
that he just has to practice

1886
01:47:15.887 --> 01:47:18.723
like a Buddhist monk meditates.

1887
01:47:18.807 --> 01:47:20.225
Caballero has his artwork.

1888
01:47:20.308 --> 01:47:22.561
Mike McGill--
I think that Mike has a real

1889
01:47:22.644 --> 01:47:24.396
healthy relationship
with his skateboarding.

1890
01:47:24.479 --> 01:47:26.898
I think he realizes
his better days are behind him.

1891
01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:28.066
He's fine with that.

1892
01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:31.695
I think Lance still feels

1893
01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:33.947
he's got to prove himself
in backyard pools.

1894
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:37.492
So Lance and Tony--

1895
01:47:37.576 --> 01:47:38.910
They're in a different place.

1896
01:47:40.203 --> 01:47:42.873
- We're gonna go over
to Bob Burnquist's house.

1897
01:47:42.956 --> 01:47:44.708
compound. ramp.

1898
01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.710
I'd like to do a 360
over the gap.

1899
01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:48.253
And then if I make that.

1900
01:47:48.336 --> 01:47:49.754
I gotta do something
on the quarter pipe.

1901
01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:51.965
But I'll cross that bridge
when I get to it.

1902
01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:55.218
Here we are at Bob's.

1903
01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:56.720
- This looks a little crazy.
- There it is.

1904
01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:57.762
- It's a little crazy-looking.

1905
01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:26.917
- Whoo!

1906
01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:30.253
- I've seen him
get way more hurt

1907
01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.380
and try way more
gnarly things now

1908
01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:34.966
than he ever did
back when he was a kid.

1909
01:48:37.385 --> 01:48:38.720
- Yeah!

1910
01:48:38.803 --> 01:48:40.347
- Tony!

1911
01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:57.864
- I was there when he tried
the loop for the first time.

1912
01:49:04.996 --> 01:49:07.290
And I actually.
at one point. said.

1913
01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:10.168
"Can you just. like.
make him stop. please?

1914
01:49:10.252 --> 01:49:12.337
Can we stop this?"
But he didn't.

1915
01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.479
- Yeah!

1916
01:49:31.106 --> 01:49:33.650
- One of the reasons
he's accomplished so much

1917
01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:36.486
is. he doesn't think
about the bad things.

1918
01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:38.154
He doesn't let that get to him.

1919
01:49:42.117 --> 01:49:44.494
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1920
01:49:46.204 --> 01:49:48.915
- Tony is competing
against Tony.

1921
01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:51.334
He's always been
competing against Tony.

1922
01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:54.504
- Three. two. one. go!

1923
01:49:57.924 --> 01:50:01.386
- Tony does not tire
of getting hurt.

1924
01:50:01.469 --> 01:50:03.680
he does not tire of repetition.

1925
01:50:03.763 --> 01:50:06.016
and he does not tire
of just doing the same thing

1926
01:50:06.099 --> 01:50:08.018
and attempting it
over and over.

1927
01:50:18.987 --> 01:50:20.822
- You know. one thing for sure
about Tony

1928
01:50:20.905 --> 01:50:23.074
is that he can take a slam.

1929
01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:25.660
It's rare to find people who

1930
01:50:25.744 --> 01:50:28.872
like to get back up
and try it again.

1931
01:50:36.504 --> 01:50:39.382
- The reason he's been hurt
more than most people

1932
01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:41.092
is because he's attempting

1933
01:50:41.176 --> 01:50:43.887
so many more things
that they would never attempt.

1934
01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:50.894
- Holy shit.

1935
01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.896
- He's going to take some hits.

1936
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:01.237
- One time.
I saw Tony fall at Del Mar.

1937
01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:05.200
and I guess his knee was
locking up and getting stuck.

1938
01:51:05.283 --> 01:51:06.201
I'm looking at it.

1939
01:51:06.284 --> 01:51:07.243
and he's like.
"Yeah. my knee's stuck."

1940
01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:09.079
And he's like.
"Pull it! Pull it! Pull it!"

1941
01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:11.039
I think it was his dad
or something like that

1942
01:51:11.122 --> 01:51:12.332
pulling on it.

1943
01:51:12.415 --> 01:51:15.085
And boom! And then he's like.
"Oh. all right."

1944
01:51:15.168 --> 01:51:18.088
He gets back up
and goes to skate again.

1945
01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:21.424
I'm like. "If my knee
got stuck. I'd be like.

1946
01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:23.093
'I need to go to a doctor.'"

1947
01:51:23.176 --> 01:51:25.595
And he's like. "No. I'm good."

1948
01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:26.763
- Broke my elbow.

1949
01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:29.891
Knocked my teeth out
at least five times.

1950
01:51:29.974 --> 01:51:32.769
Didn't dislocate my shoulder.
but it went out and in.

1951
01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:36.064
Rolled my ankles so far
that they should have broken.

1952
01:51:36.147 --> 01:51:39.234
and maybe I would have
benefited more if they had.

1953
01:51:39.317 --> 01:51:41.111
'cause now they're just
kind of loose.

1954
01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:43.905
I've had dozens of concussions

1955
01:51:43.988 --> 01:51:46.950
but only a few
that were really bad.

1956
01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:49.244
where I woke up somewhere else.

1957
01:51:49.327 --> 01:51:51.579
- His body's pretty messed up.

1958
01:51:51.663 --> 01:51:53.623
You know. if you watch him
turn and stuff like that.

1959
01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:55.500
he's got a lot of stiffness.

1960
01:51:55.583 --> 01:51:57.502
- I know what he has.
which a lot of us get.

1961
01:51:57.585 --> 01:52:00.296
is. we get whiplash
from taking slams.

1962
01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.173
And he has it really bad.

1963
01:52:02.257 --> 01:52:03.675
- I'm that guy
that people ask. like.

1964
01:52:03.758 --> 01:52:04.968
"Something wrong
with your neck?"

1965
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:08.054
I'm like. "Yes.
40 years of whiplash."

1966
01:52:10.807 --> 01:52:12.684
- Whoa!
- Shit!

1967
01:52:14.102 --> 01:52:16.062
That's not good.

1968
01:52:16.146 --> 01:52:17.564
- Medic!
- Hey. medic! Quick!

1969
01:52:17.647 --> 01:52:19.941
- Medic! Medic!

1970
01:52:20.024 --> 01:52:21.985
- Can you hear me. Tony?

1971
01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:23.903
Can you hear me?

1972
01:52:25.029 --> 01:52:26.156
You all right?

1973
01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.866
- It hurts. man.
- I know. man.

1974
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:30.326
You okay?
- Yeah.

1975
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.995
- All right. I don't want--
- Cut the pads off.

1976
01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.455
- Minimal movement. okay?
- What is this?

1977
01:52:33.538 --> 01:52:35.874
- Minimal movement.
- Okay.

1978
01:52:35.957 --> 01:52:38.084
- Hold that on your head
right there.

1979
01:52:38.168 --> 01:52:40.670
- Fractured my skull.
broke my thumb.

1980
01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:42.380
broke my pelvis.

1981
01:52:42.464 --> 01:52:44.841
I sat in bed
for about six weeks.

1982
01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:46.843
And I thought.
"Maybe this is it."

1983
01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:49.429
Everyone kept asking me.
"How long can you skate?"

1984
01:52:49.512 --> 01:52:51.848
Maybe this is the answer.
This is how long I can skate.

1985
01:52:51.931 --> 01:52:54.142
I can skate till I'm 35.
when I break my pelvis.

1986
01:52:54.225 --> 01:52:57.103
- When I got knocked out in
Australia about five years ago

1987
01:52:57.187 --> 01:52:59.105
or something.
I was asking everybody. like.

1988
01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:01.149
"How long does this
fuzziness last. you know?"

1989
01:53:01.232 --> 01:53:03.318
I'm like. "Tony. you've been
knocked out a bunch of times.

1990
01:53:03.401 --> 01:53:04.486
How long does it"--

1991
01:53:04.569 --> 01:53:05.653
He's like.
"I don't know. Mike."

1992
01:53:05.737 --> 01:53:07.655
I'm like. "How many times
you been knocked out?"

1993
01:53:07.739 --> 01:53:09.115
You know.
he couldn't even recall

1994
01:53:09.199 --> 01:53:10.408
how many times
he's been knocked out.

1995
01:53:11.784 --> 01:53:14.746
- Can you imagine
watching your dad

1996
01:53:14.829 --> 01:53:17.790
tumble down a ramp at 56?

1997
01:53:17.874 --> 01:53:19.209
No.

1998
01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:20.919
- Like. we're grandparents.

1999
01:53:21.002 --> 01:53:24.547
We're grandparents
falling out of the sky.

2000
01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.049
- Why still push yourself

2001
01:53:26.132 --> 01:53:28.510
when there's no reward
of board sales

2002
01:53:28.593 --> 01:53:32.222
or contest winnings
or anything like that?

2003
01:53:32.305 --> 01:53:33.431
- That is the question.

2004
01:53:33.515 --> 01:53:35.058
That is the question.
why we do that.

2005
01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:37.936
I don't know.
It's just in us.

2006
01:53:38.019 --> 01:53:39.395
- Why do you think
Tony does it?

2007
01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:41.189
Why do you think
he pushes himself so hard?

2008
01:53:42.607 --> 01:53:44.859
- I think it's to impress
all of us. you know?

2009
01:53:44.943 --> 01:53:47.904
I think it's--I honestly do.

2010
01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:49.989
because. you know.
most of the world

2011
01:53:50.073 --> 01:53:53.701
that's gonna see this film
doesn't know a Madonna

2012
01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:56.204
from a McTwist
from a Caballerial.

2013
01:53:56.287 --> 01:53:57.914
But his peers do.

2014
01:53:57.997 --> 01:53:59.874
And we are blown away

2015
01:53:59.958 --> 01:54:02.168
every time
we see something like this.

2016
01:54:02.252 --> 01:54:05.922
And it inspires us to go on
and do something different.

2017
01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:08.675
because that's what
skateboarding is all about.

2018
01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:18.142
- We had the 30-year reunion
of the "Animal Chin" video.

2019
01:54:18.226 --> 01:54:21.980
To commemorate that.
Tony had a replica

2020
01:54:22.063 --> 01:54:25.108
of the infamous Chin ramp
built.

2021
01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:27.902
Caballero. McGill.
Lance. Tony. myself.

2022
01:54:27.986 --> 01:54:29.529
Tommy Guerrero. Rodney Mullen.

2023
01:54:29.612 --> 01:54:31.155
and a whole bunch
of other people

2024
01:54:31.239 --> 01:54:32.782
were there to celebrate.

2025
01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:35.451
So we got to watch them
skate it again.

2026
01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:38.413
And they reproduced
all the famous tricks

2027
01:54:38.496 --> 01:54:40.039
that they did at the time.

2028
01:54:44.586 --> 01:54:47.130
- 30 years later. these guys
are doing their famous.

2029
01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:48.798
you know. four-invert shot.

2030
01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:50.174
- Can we just try?
- Eee!

2031
01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:52.844
- This is it!

2032
01:54:52.927 --> 01:54:56.681
- One. Two. Three.

2033
01:55:05.523 --> 01:55:07.150
- Yoo-hoo!

2034
01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:11.446
- Lock it up.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

2035
01:55:11.529 --> 01:55:14.532
- That's amazing.
That's totally amazing.

2036
01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:25.168
- Yeah. Steve!
Nice!

2037
01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:28.338
- Whenever Caballero or McGill
did something

2038
01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:29.964
that was a little bit
too edgy.

2039
01:55:30.048 --> 01:55:31.716
you could see them
stop midair and.

2040
01:55:31.799 --> 01:55:33.843
"That's it. Stop."

2041
01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:35.720
Every time they'd do something

2042
01:55:35.803 --> 01:55:38.848
and it was a touch off
of what they were out.

2043
01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:41.351
they'd throw the board
and slide--knee slide.

2044
01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.685
You could tell there was
no messing around.

2045
01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:43.978
These guys aren't getting hurt.

2046
01:55:45.730 --> 01:55:47.148
- As the temperature
started increasing

2047
01:55:47.231 --> 01:55:48.441
and these guys
started pushing each other.

2048
01:55:48.524 --> 01:55:52.695
Tony. like always. he started
going harder and harder.

2049
01:56:00.036 --> 01:56:01.496
- Yeah!
- Oh!

2050
01:56:01.579 --> 01:56:02.705
- Oh!

2051
01:56:09.337 --> 01:56:10.755
- Just chill out.
Just chill.

2052
01:56:10.838 --> 01:56:13.174
Just chill. Just chill.
Just chill out.

2053
01:56:13.257 --> 01:56:14.842
- Tony. just chill.
Tony. just chill.

2054
01:56:14.926 --> 01:56:16.844
Just chill. Lay there.
Stay there.

2055
01:56:16.928 --> 01:56:19.681
- Just kick back.
Kick back. Kick back.

2056
01:56:19.764 --> 01:56:22.934
Here.
- Hey.

2057
01:56:23.017 --> 01:56:24.519
- There you go.

2058
01:56:35.613 --> 01:56:37.073
- What is your name?

2059
01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:43.538
Wait. wait. wait.
What's your name?

2060
01:56:43.621 --> 01:56:44.956
- Tony Hawk.

2061
01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:51.087
- All of us just gasped.
It's like. "Oh. my God."

2062
01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:54.090
He's down there. laying there.
dead still.

2063
01:57:17.822 --> 01:57:20.241
He got himself up off the ramp
after about five minutes.

2064
01:57:20.324 --> 01:57:22.285
and then he went and sat down
at the bottom of the ramp.

2065
01:57:22.368 --> 01:57:24.370
and he just sat there.

2066
01:57:24.454 --> 01:57:26.581
- There's some water
right here.

2067
01:57:26.664 --> 01:57:31.252
- His hair was. like.
Einstein-y. pitch-white skin.

2068
01:57:31.335 --> 01:57:33.004
and he looked 70 years old.

2069
01:57:33.087 --> 01:57:35.173
It was shocking.
It was really scary.

2070
01:57:35.256 --> 01:57:38.760
And I sat there going. "Man.
you can't do this at this age.

2071
01:57:38.843 --> 01:57:43.306
You can't put yourself in that
kind of danger at this age."

2072
01:57:43.389 --> 01:57:45.349
especially with the career
he's had.

2073
01:57:45.433 --> 01:57:47.810
And it really.
really troubled me.

2074
01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:49.645
And I went and had
a really long conversation

2075
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:50.938
with Sean Mortimer afterwards.

2076
01:57:51.022 --> 01:57:52.940
saying. "Look. somebody's
gotta talk to Tony.

2077
01:57:53.024 --> 01:57:54.358
He can't let this happen."

2078
01:57:54.442 --> 01:57:55.735
I talked to Steve Hawk.

2079
01:57:55.818 --> 01:57:57.320
I called Steve Hawk
on the phone.

2080
01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.655
And I'm going.
"Steve. Tony's gotta be told

2081
01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:01.449
he can't do this."

2082
01:58:01.532 --> 01:58:02.784
But I couldn't get any takers.

2083
01:58:02.867 --> 01:58:04.619
I couldn't get anybody
to. like--

2084
01:58:04.702 --> 01:58:06.078
guys. you've got to--

2085
01:58:06.162 --> 01:58:07.622
there's got to be
an intervention here.

2086
01:58:07.705 --> 01:58:09.874
I mean. come on!

2087
01:58:09.957 --> 01:58:12.335
That's not a bad concussion.

2088
01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:15.421
That's a disaster. you know?

2089
01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:26.015
- I don't know
what I think about it.

2090
01:58:26.098 --> 01:58:28.559
I think it's no one's place
to say that to him.

2091
01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:32.605
- Okay.
So what do you mean?

2092
01:58:34.232 --> 01:58:35.441
- I don't know.

2093
01:58:37.819 --> 01:58:38.986
He doesn't unders--

2094
01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.156
He doesn't even understand

2095
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:44.283
that we're gonna probably
die skateboarding

2096
01:58:44.367 --> 01:58:45.493
and kill ourselves.

2097
01:58:45.576 --> 01:58:48.204
It's something
you can't change.

2098
01:58:50.748 --> 01:58:51.874
I can't sleep.

2099
01:58:53.167 --> 01:58:56.212
I can't sleep on my shoulders.
It's terrible.

2100
01:58:56.295 --> 01:58:57.505
It's horrible.

2101
01:58:57.588 --> 01:59:00.675
You're actually destroying
yourself on what you love.

2102
01:59:00.758 --> 01:59:04.554
But it's not--it's too late.
first of all.

2103
01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:06.514
to be concerned about. like.

2104
01:59:06.597 --> 01:59:07.974
"Oh. it's time for us
to slow down."

2105
01:59:08.057 --> 01:59:09.350
Like. I don't know.
I don't know to--

2106
01:59:09.433 --> 01:59:11.727
I don't know
how to react to that.

2107
01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:13.896
He's right. but I don't know
how to react to it.

2108
01:59:17.441 --> 01:59:19.527
- I worry a lot that he's--

2109
01:59:19.610 --> 01:59:21.445
that he will really
hurt himself.

2110
01:59:21.529 --> 01:59:22.572
Some of the stuff he's done.

2111
01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:25.032
if something went wrong.
he could have died for sure.

2112
01:59:25.116 --> 01:59:27.368
And that scares
the fuck out of me.

2113
01:59:27.451 --> 01:59:31.205
- The abuse their bodies
are taking is pretty absurd.

2114
01:59:31.289 --> 01:59:32.832
Like. Tony is just--

2115
01:59:32.915 --> 01:59:35.918
Tony and Lance might be
the most battered dudes.

2116
01:59:36.002 --> 01:59:37.086
like. of all of them.

2117
01:59:37.169 --> 01:59:39.046
Tony especially. man. he's--

2118
01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:40.256
you've seen his fingers.

2119
01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:41.924
They're all fucking
out of socket.

2120
01:59:42.008 --> 01:59:43.759
And just--
his shins are all fucked up.

2121
01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:46.137
He tried the full pipe.

2122
01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:50.057
and--but he gets
so fucking slammed.

2123
01:59:50.141 --> 01:59:51.434
But he continues.

2124
01:59:53.436 --> 01:59:54.645
- Yeah. it's foolish.

2125
01:59:54.729 --> 01:59:57.398
It's foolish
what we've done to ourselves.

2126
01:59:57.481 --> 02:00:00.735
Tony--a lot of us.
It's foolish.

2127
02:00:00.818 --> 02:00:02.695
We're gonna live
in absolute pain.

2128
02:00:04.822 --> 02:00:07.658
I've had so many concussions.
I know I have.

2129
02:00:09.452 --> 02:00:11.078
You know.

2130
02:00:11.162 --> 02:00:12.788
I know I have what those
football players have.

2131
02:00:12.872 --> 02:00:14.916
and I'm probably gonna have
a brain tumor like my dad.

2132
02:00:14.999 --> 02:00:16.167
I'm sure of it.

2133
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:17.418
And it's because...

2134
02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:24.300
We were stupid skateboarding
and we got injured.

2135
02:00:24.383 --> 02:00:26.594
It is what it is.

2136
02:00:26.677 --> 02:00:30.473
He is going to probably get
another gnarly concussion.

2137
02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:32.350
He's probably gonna
break another bone.

2138
02:00:32.433 --> 02:00:33.809
He's probably gonna
get to the point

2139
02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:37.188
where his body
will not let him do it.

2140
02:00:37.271 --> 02:00:39.106
And that's the way
we're gonna go.

2141
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:41.025
Stupid?
Yes.

2142
02:00:41.108 --> 02:00:45.196
- Maybe it's. like. not smart.
I don't know.

2143
02:00:45.279 --> 02:00:49.158
But we forget about. you know.
the pain and the suffering

2144
02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:52.119
that we go through
to get to that next level.

2145
02:00:52.203 --> 02:00:53.913
And I think it's those people
that are afraid

2146
02:00:53.996 --> 02:00:56.666
to go through that.

2147
02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:58.459
you know.
that pain and suffering.

2148
02:00:58.542 --> 02:01:01.337
that never amount to anything

2149
02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:05.508
than just a normal. safe life.
you know?

2150
02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:10.513
We don't live
in those parameters. you know.

2151
02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:14.016
- There's consequences
to everything we do.

2152
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.979
But when you tap--tiptoe
around the consequences...

2153
02:01:20.398 --> 02:01:21.816
Tony was having consequen--

2154
02:01:21.899 --> 02:01:23.526
he would never have
reached what he did

2155
02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:26.654
if he listened to those
consequences things back then.

2156
02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:32.535
"You're too small.
You can't get to the top.

2157
02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:34.286
"You do it weird.
We don't like you.

2158
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:36.580
Here's a beer can in the"--
what?

2159
02:01:36.664 --> 02:01:37.832
We all would have stopped

2160
02:01:37.915 --> 02:01:40.042
if we'd listened
to anybody telling us. like.

2161
02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:42.336
"You know. there's gonna be
a cost to this."

2162
02:01:46.465 --> 02:01:49.135
And some are gonna pay more.

2163
02:01:49.218 --> 02:01:53.389
- This is the luxury
of having spent my life

2164
02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.516
doing what I love.

2165
02:01:55.599 --> 02:01:57.351
The cost of that...

2166
02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:01.689
It sucks.

2167
02:02:04.275 --> 02:02:06.027
I'm not blind.

2168
02:02:07.445 --> 02:02:10.823
I'm not numb to the pain.

2169
02:02:10.906 --> 02:02:12.533
I would argue
I'm more conscious of it

2170
02:02:12.616 --> 02:02:14.368
than anybody else.

2171
02:02:14.452 --> 02:02:17.830
But I'm also more conscious
of what that gives me.

2172
02:02:20.958 --> 02:02:24.253
And when I'm done with this...

2173
02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.259
That will be what it is.
and I'll find a way.

2174
02:02:30.342 --> 02:02:33.763
But there's something
inside of me propelling

2175
02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:38.559
that I'm not going to give up
until the wheels fall off.

2176
02:02:38.642 --> 02:02:41.604
That's what I'm made of.

2177
02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:45.399
And I wish--I see all
the arguments against it.

2178
02:02:45.483 --> 02:02:49.320
But I wish I could relate
the intangibles to you.

2179
02:02:51.405 --> 02:02:55.242
My guess is that
we're all built the same.

2180
02:02:55.326 --> 02:02:58.329
None of us are
completely stupid.

2181
02:02:58.412 --> 02:03:00.790
A little deranged.
I think a strong argument.

2182
02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:03.084
I do.

2183
02:03:03.167 --> 02:03:05.836
But ultimately.

2184
02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.090
we also know what we have.

2185
02:03:09.173 --> 02:03:11.842
And to go and lay down
in that sense of it...

2186
02:03:15.346 --> 02:03:19.350
That's like embracing
what we've done with our lives.

2187
02:03:19.433 --> 02:03:20.851
You know?

2188
02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:06.480
- I found this thing
that I've loved

2189
02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:08.816
more than anything else
that I've tried

2190
02:04:08.899 --> 02:04:10.359
or done in my life.

2191
02:04:12.945 --> 02:04:16.448
I found my purpose
and my salvation.

2192
02:04:18.075 --> 02:04:22.997
And in some ways.
I found my emotional highs.

2193
02:04:25.916 --> 02:04:29.336
I'm still trying
to push my limits.

2194
02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:35.968
I don't know how long
this will last.

2195
02:04:36.051 --> 02:04:38.762
But I'm not gonna quit.
