[Maren] Hey.

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.633
You are here.
Where have you been?

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:53.287
You weren't in Home Ec.
all week.

18
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.158
I got to slip to work
on the yearbook.

19
00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:56.855
We missed our deadline
with Jostens.

20
00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.248
Oh. How's it look?

21
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.773
You're not gonna be in it.
by the way.

are sleeping over.

[continues playing piano]

28
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.659
No. my dad won't let me.

29
00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:19.791
So sneak out.
After he goes to bed.

30
00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.533
How would I get there?

31
00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:24.970
You're down
in Southwind. right?

32
00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.538
You know the power lines
that go up the hill?

33
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:31.151
That's Chesapeake Road
at the top. I'm right there.

34
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.458

more friends here.

Hey. That was good
on the road.

40

Gotta work on that parking
some more...

41

42
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:32.690
You think
it's gonna rain tonight?

43
00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:35.954
Don't think it's supposed to.

Just reading. Dad.

47
00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:56.453
The man has attempted suicide.

48
00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.020
I think he realized

49
00:03:58.063 --> 00:04:01.545
that this scheme that
he had been involved in.

50
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.679
about which he had
always been extremely guilty.

51
00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:07.812
I mean. he's... he's.
I think. the only person

52
00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:13.035
in this entire scheme to have
voluntarily walked out on it.

53
00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:16.865
Some people were annoyed
with it. upset with it.

54
00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:19.607
and... but went along with it.
Others enjoyed it

55
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.522
because they were making
a lot of money out of it.

56
00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:25.700
Dowd was the only person
who had the character...

long before anybody
knew about it.

62
00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:35.144
because it disgusted him.

63
00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:38.756
I mean.
the prospect of actually

64
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.802

Donald Manes' office

65
00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:42.020

[Kim] So you can't

[Maren] Not all night.

75
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.751
I should be back
by 6:00 to be safe.

Jesus.

77
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.800
I'll just head out
when you guys wanna sleep.

78

So where'd you move here
from anyway?

Or photos even.

tell me anything.

92

And then...

120
00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:14.657
I want you to make sure
this. uh...

121
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:16.877
this tape is good
and destroyed. Don't keep it.

122
00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.183
This has got my voice on it.

123
00:10:20.968 --> 00:10:22.970
You're not going
to see me again. Maren.

124
00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:27.670
I can't...

125
00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:31.631

I can't do anything else.
either.

128
00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:40.727
Call the cops or whatever
somebody might do in my place.

129
00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:44.992
So I gotta leave you
to figure it out for yourself.

130
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.995
Like your mother did.

131
00:10:48.038 --> 00:10:50.562
I'm sorry. You know
what I mean now.

132
00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:53.348
I don't know how much...

133
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:56.568
how much of what I'm gonna say
you'll remember.

134
00:10:57.918 --> 00:11:00.660
[sighs] Yeah. Never was sure.

135
00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:03.227
But just in case.

136
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:04.664
I'll tell you
everything I know.

137
00:11:06.753 --> 00:11:08.450

when you were three.

[newscaster]
Downey has the crowd screaming

140
00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:18.895
at Towson State University.

141
00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:20.984
The topic was
the most controversial issue

142
00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.725
on this year's
Maryland ballot.

143
00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:24.161
the gun ban referendum.

144
00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:25.641
The majority of those
in the audience

145
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.251
seem to be against the ban.

146
00:11:27.295 --> 00:11:28.775
but we found those
on both sides of the issue.

147
00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:30.124
[woman] I think
it's a good law.

148
00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.603
if she gets
guns off the streets.

149
00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:33.518
and that's what we need most.

150
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:35.172
[man] I just
don't think it's fair

151
00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:37.044
for all the innocent people
that wanna get a gun

152
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:39.089
to protect themselves.

153
00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:42.484
Just making it easier for
criminals to have them than
honest people.

154
00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:45.226
[man 2] I don't want them comin'
in my living room and tell me
what I can and can't buy.

155
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:46.967
Y'all think if you take
the guns away from everybody.

156
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.056
you have less shooting
with the whole nine-yards.

157
00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:51.101
the criminals
and the innocent people.

158
00:11:58.326 --> 00:11:59.327
Hi.

159
00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:00.850
Uh...

160
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.723
I need to get here.

161
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:07.683
What's the closest
I can get by bus?

162
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.338
Well. looks like
Detroit Lakes.

163
00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:15.473
Three transfers.

164
00:12:15.517 --> 00:12:19.260
Frederick. Maryland.
Columbus and Minneapolis.

165
00:12:21.044 --> 00:12:23.220
One way? 83.

166
00:12:25.048 --> 00:12:26.441
How much to Columbus?

167
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.663
Shouldn't you be in school?

168
00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:34.362
You'd think.

169
00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:35.929
I don't know what that means.

170
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.410
Means I'm 18.
in the state of Maryland.

171
00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:41.369
and I can decide for myself
where I should be.

172
00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:46.940
I'm gonna need to see
a driver's license
or a learner's permit.

173
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.466
You can see
a birth certificate.

174
00:12:54.469 --> 00:12:55.339
Come on.

175
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.089
Just to Columbus?

176
00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:07.656
It's 49.

177
00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:09.876

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.333
[chuckles] Her name was Penny.

181
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:35.989
When I came in.
she was on the bathroom floor.

182
00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:39.166
There was... so much blood.

183
00:13:40.645 --> 00:13:42.256
Her face was chewed up bad.

184
00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:46.390
but the worst of it
was her neck.

185
00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:49.872
She must've been holding you
when you started in on her.

186
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.526
Her hands. all chewed up. I...

187
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:54.877
I thought you were dead too.

188
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:56.052
That somebody
had done you both.

189
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:58.098
but you were sleepin'.

190
00:13:58.141 --> 00:14:00.448
When I turned you over.
I saw the blood on your mouth.

191
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:04.887
You had something
in your cheek.

192
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:07.890
I fished it out. It was soft.
like a wad of gum.

193
00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:09.457
It had a little hole in it.

194
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:11.807
Where an earring would go.

195
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:16.203
I remember thanking God
she hadn't been wearing any.

196
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:17.204
you could've choked.

197
00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:20.816
I got the body out.

198
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.122
I bleached the place
three times.

199
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:23.427
and then packed us up
and left.

200
00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:25.995
They never found
where I put her.

201
00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:30.870
That was the last time
I used our real last name.

202
00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:33.829
Now you know why.

203
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.136
Nothin' happened
for a few years. I relaxed.

204
00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:39.095
You had to start school
and I thought...

205
00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:41.184
I thought you wouldn't
do it in public.

206
00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:42.098
and you didn't.

207
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:44.144
But you got clever.

208
00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:46.798
So fucking clever.

209
00:14:58.723 --> 00:14:59.899
[sighs]

210
00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:01.248
[thunder rumbling]

211
00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:23.923
[rain pattering]

212
00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:40.243
[thunder continues rumbling]

213
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:11.057
I didn't mean to scare you.

214
00:16:11.883 --> 00:16:13.711
[breathing shakily]

215
00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:16.279
You waiting for the bus?

216
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.805
Well. no. missy. I...

217
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:23.417
I came lookin' for you.

218
00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:28.204
Do I know you?

219
00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:32.992
I guess not in the way
you mean.

220
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:38.040
I smelled you.

221
00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:40.695
You probably smell me now.

222
00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:44.525
When was the last time
you fed?

223
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:47.963
[thunder rumbling]

224
00:16:51.184 --> 00:16:52.707
[sniffs]

225
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.970
[Maren] Stop. stop.
stop there. Stop.

226
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.933
You haven't in a long time.
[sniffs]

227
00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:02.934
I'll say...

228
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:06.373
many months.

229
00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:08.592
At least.

230
00:17:10.377 --> 00:17:11.856
You can smell that?

231
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.771
[chuckles] Oh. sure.

232
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:15.860
You can...

233
00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:19.734
You can smell lots of things
if you know how.

234
00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:20.604
[sniffs]

235
00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:25.044
And we just smell anyway.
[laughs]

236
00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:28.438
Whether we ate or not.

237
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.200
Hmm.

238
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:00.166
Come on. missy.

239
00:18:02.864 --> 00:18:03.691
Come on.

240
00:18:13.788 --> 00:18:14.615
Come on.

241
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:21.056
[Maren] Where are we goin'?

242
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.537
Just here.
someplace dry and safe.

243
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:26.366
I'm Sullivan.

244
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:29.325
Friends call me Sully.

245
00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:31.762
Maren.

246
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:34.548
Is this your house?

247
00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:38.552
Listen. Maren.

248
00:18:38.595 --> 00:18:40.684
don't worry. I'm okay.

249
00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:43.165
I got rules.

250
00:18:43.818 --> 00:18:45.559
One. number one

251
00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:49.389
is never. never. ever
eat an Eater.

252
00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:51.130
Think you can follow that too?

253
00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:53.915
All right.

254
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.786
I'll fix some dinner for us.

255
00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:02.489
I smelled you from the yard.
little missy. Come on.

256
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.099
This far?

257
00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:08.364
[Sully] Round the back.
We'll talk inside.

258
00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:44.183
The Sully. he found
these little Cornish hens

259
00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:46.707
in the freezer.

260
00:19:48.752 --> 00:19:50.014
These hens.

261
00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:53.670
they look like
they had a good life.

262
00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:01.591
Thought I was the only one.

263
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:04.855
Are there lots of us?

264
00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:05.943
Not lots.

265
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:08.555
But more...

266
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:11.775
more than you'd think.

267
00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:14.778
You've met a few. sure.
that you know of.

268
00:20:15.823 --> 00:20:17.172
[bones snapping]

269
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:21.132
You never had anyone
take a interest in you?

270
00:20:21.176 --> 00:20:23.744
[stutters] A double take?

271
00:20:23.787 --> 00:20:24.788
[chuckles]

272
00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:27.095
Just always thought--

273
00:20:27.138 --> 00:20:31.665
You just thought
some people are creepy.

274
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:36.409
It's better if we all
steer clear of one another.

275
00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:39.629
We're dangerous to non-Eaters.

276
00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:44.634
but we can hurt
one another just as bad.

277
00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:47.071
I hope you're
hearing me on this.

278
00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:48.943
[thunder rumbling]

279
00:20:50.336 --> 00:20:52.033
You sound like my dad.

280
00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:54.253
Your daddy find out about you?

281
00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:00.694
What about you?

282
00:21:02.348 --> 00:21:05.394
You basically just said
steer clear of people like us.

283
00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:08.789
But you came looking for me.

284
00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:10.269
[chuckling]

285
00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.661
Smart.

286
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:17.145
When I saw you're just
a girl on your own.

287
00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:20.061
I thought...

288
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.413
you might be hungry.

289
00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:28.243
For hens?

290
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:31.899
[breathing heavily]

291
00:21:34.902 --> 00:21:36.251
No.

292
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.359
Who lives here?

293
00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:00.971
Well. go and look.

294
00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:12.896
[Maren sniffing]

295
00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:15.595
Use your nose.

296
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:17.858
What do you smell?

297
00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:20.513
Is there someone
dead up there?

298
00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:22.645
What do you smell?

299
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:25.387
Describe it.

300
00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:30.349
Metallic.

301
00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:34.091
Like blood?

302
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:38.444
No. like mud.

303
00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:43.100
Something tangy.

304
00:22:45.712 --> 00:22:48.236
But not like rotten.

305
00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:50.804
No.

306
00:22:54.634 --> 00:22:55.635
But close.

307
00:22:56.592 --> 00:22:58.377
More like vinegar.

308
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.251
Like vinegar in the soup.

309
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.907
Yeah. Yeah.

-[Sully] Missy.

313
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.290
-We'll get help.
-Missy.

314
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:43.509
What did you do to her?

315
00:23:43.552 --> 00:23:45.424
I found her like that
this mornin'.

316
00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:47.426
You're lying. Let me by.

317
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:50.211
Listen.
Let me bone down on this.

318
00:23:51.038 --> 00:23:52.431
Whatever you and I got.

319
00:23:53.214 --> 00:23:54.781
it's gotta be fed.

320
00:23:54.824 --> 00:23:56.435
[breathing shakily]

321
00:23:58.219 --> 00:23:59.394
No. Uh...

322
00:24:00.874 --> 00:24:02.397
No. 'cause it was...

323
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:06.749
It was years
before my last time.

324
00:24:06.793 --> 00:24:09.099
[sighs]
That's because you're young.

325
00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:14.148
You're gonna need it
more and more.

326
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:16.672
-and more and more.
-[whimpering]

327
00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:21.068
And you won't always be able
to hold yourself back.

328
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.462
But if the circumstances is...

329
00:24:24.027 --> 00:24:26.029
is safe and good.

330
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:28.336
then eat.

331
00:24:29.555 --> 00:24:31.078
It'll last a while.

332
00:24:31.121 --> 00:24:33.994
maybe it'll keep you from.

333
00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:36.431
you know.
doing something you'll regret.

334
00:24:38.694 --> 00:24:40.696

335
00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:42.393
Even more.

00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:45.048
Even more. missy.

337
00:24:48.617 --> 00:24:50.532
Yes. Sully found her that way.

338
00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:52.621
I followed my nose.

339
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:58.888
I don't...
I don't kill people.

340
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.110
At least I try not to.

341
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.593
That leaves this.

Can I have
a few minutes. please?

345
00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:27.177
Sure. you can.

346
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:34.576
I don't think
it'll be a long time now.

347
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.100
When the time comes.
you'll smell it.

01:02:34.402 --> 01:02:36.013
I won. I won.

889
01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:37.318
No. you didn't. little man.

890
01:02:38.493 --> 01:02:40.104
[boy] But... But it's in a can.

891
01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:43.368
What does that mean?

892
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:44.891
What you just did.
No underhand.

893
01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:46.327
But that other kid did it.

894
01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:48.590
You can read. can't you?

895
01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:50.984
Now go on. Unless you got
three more tickets.

896
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.119
Hey. man.

897
01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.469
You tryin' to win one
for your girlfriend?
I saw you walk up.

898
01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:58.905
Oh. no.
that's not my girlfriend.

899
01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:01.255
That's just. uh. a friend.
you know. [chuckles]

900
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.220
-[CLANG]
-Nice.

901
01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:11.396
- Wow.
- Can I get another one
if I sink it again?

902
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:13.137
You're not supposed to.

903
01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.965
But. uh. no one has to know.

904
01:03:22.015 --> 01:03:23.190
Damn.

905
01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:24.235
Disappoint.

906
01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.324
Hmm.

907
01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:28.326
What's there to do around here
besides this dumbass carnival?

908
01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:31.285
After my friend leaves.
I mean.

909
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.031
I close up at 11:00.

910
01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.294
I got some weed in my car.

911
01:03:40.338 --> 01:03:41.295
Hell. yeah.

912
01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:44.255
-One more?
-Really?

913
01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:45.125
Yeah.

914
01:03:50.348 --> 01:03:51.740
-Damn. [laughs]
-Damn.

915
01:03:58.008 --> 01:03:58.835
Lucky. lucky.

916
01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:05.493
My luck's not
gonna run out. is it?

917
01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:06.973
No. man.

918
01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:09.193
I'll see that it don't.

919
01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:11.630
I'll see you in an hour?

920
01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:14.720
Yeah. you will.

921
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.899
[Maren's father on tape]
I haven't thought much
beyond this tape.

922
01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:22.902
I can't.

923
01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.295
I don't know
what's going to happen to you

924
01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.863
or what should happen to you.

925
01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:31.737
I wake up nights sick to death
wondering and hoping.

926
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.565
Hoping that whatever
troubles you is over.

927
01:04:33.608 --> 01:04:36.742
and that if there is
a God in Heaven.

928
01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:38.265
that you're just
a regular girl

929
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:41.834
with... regular problems
and regular pain.

930
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.662
and that you stop
wanting things

931
01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:45.882
you shouldn't want. Maren.

932
01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:48.885
And that your heart
has a chance.

933
01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:51.235
[tape button clicks]

934
01:04:55.717 --> 01:04:57.589
I knew that's how
it would end.

935
01:04:58.329 --> 01:04:59.634
"I hope you get better."

936
01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:04.683
Maybe he's right.
maybe I should pray

937
01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:06.598
that I wake up one day

938
01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:08.165
to find they built
a maze around me.

939
01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:09.035
Don't say that.

940
01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:11.342
Don't.

941
01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:14.911
He's wrong.

942
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:19.785
He's wrong.

943
01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:23.745
[Lee sighs]

944
01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.748
What happened to your dad?

945
01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.099
You never say anything.

946
01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:31.840
Nothing good.

947
01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:34.887
Just a waste.

948
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.889
-[door shuts in distance]
-[soft footsteps]

949
01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:41.024
Except in my case.
I gave him the tape.

950
01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.287
[footsteps approaching]

951
01:05:48.596 --> 01:05:49.728
Just give me
a couple of minutes.

952
01:06:12.142 --> 01:06:13.491
You made it.

953
01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:15.145
-[Lee] This is a good spot.
-Yeah. it's not bad.

954
01:06:15.188 --> 01:06:16.320
[Lee] There's no one here.

955
01:06:16.363 --> 01:06:17.625
-[man] Is that you?
-[Lee] Yeah.

956
01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:18.800
-[man] It's a nice truck.
-[Lee] Great. huh?

957
01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:20.193
[man] Yeah. she is.
I'm parked up there.

958
01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:21.064
Do you smoke?

959
01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:24.763
What are you laughing about?

960
01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:27.287
-Do you smoke weed too?
-[Lee] Yeah.

961
01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:38.907

You kinky fucker.

965
01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.145
[man] Oh. yeah.

966
01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:01.060
Faster. man.
Jerk it faster. Come on.

967
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.802
I'm close. yeah.
Yeah. like that.

Come on. come on. faster. man.

Faster. faster.
[inhales sharply]

971
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.249
Oh. yeah.

[unnerving music playing]

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.341
Oh. fuck!

974
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.430
Oh.

975
01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:30.176
[man breathing rapidly]

976
01:07:31.264 --> 01:07:32.787
Faster. jerk it faster. man.
Come on.

977
01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.227
Yeah. I'm close. I'm close.

978
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:38.837
Just like that.

979
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.666
I'm close. I'm close.
Here it comes. Here it comes.

980
01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:43.059
That sure feels... [gasps]

from Bikes Unlimited.

[tuning radio]

988
01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:23.882
[radio host 2] Don't you love
the smell of black rubber?

989
01:08:28.495 --> 01:08:30.018
Maybe not.

990
01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.717
It's an acquired taste.

991
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.588
Some people
never get used to it.

992
01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:36.851
Don't really understand.

993
01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.029
Oh. you can work your way up.

[radio chatter
continues indistinctly]

995
01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:52.867
What's wrong?

996
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:54.608
[Lee] That's the place
listed on his license.

997
01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:55.870
but the lights are on.

998
01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.744
I'm gonna go back
and see if anyone's there.

999
01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:01.963
No. no. I'll go. I'll go.
You have blood on you.

1000
01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:05.750
I cleaned up.
He had wipes in the car.

1001
01:09:05.793 --> 01:09:07.055
You can take them if you want.

1002
01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:12.800
I'll see what I can see
from the yard.

1003
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:16.761
Okay.

1004
01:09:21.896 --> 01:09:25.117

Completely hidden.

1005
01:09:26.727 --> 01:09:29.991

I'm where no one can find me.

What are you doing?

1009
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.551
What? Oh. Christ.

1010
01:10:07.594 --> 01:10:08.943
Okay. we didn't know.

1011
01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:12.208
Hey. we didn't know.
okay? [tuts]

[radio host] Only there
did civilization arise.

1017
01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:51.029
Now. it's not my intention
to give a history lesson.

1018
01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:53.553
but I believe it's important
to remind ourselves

1019
01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:55.033
that in dealing
with the economy.

1020
01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:57.035
we're dealing with
human creativity.

1021
01:10:57.992 --> 01:10:59.429
This insight has represented

1022
01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:01.692
the underpinning of
our economic expansion.

1023
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:04.347
There wasn't
a car seat. Maren.

1024

He wasn't wearing
a wedding ring.

1025
01:11:09.395 --> 01:11:10.570
We should feel something.

1026
01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:12.877
'Cause we murder people.

1027
01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.140
We steal their stuff.
we move the fuck on.

1028
01:11:15.183 --> 01:11:16.620
and we ruin lives
that we don't even see.

1029
01:11:16.663 --> 01:11:18.012
Come on. why are we talking
about it like this?

1030
01:11:18.056 --> 01:11:19.884
We gotta do this!
We have to do it!

1031
01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.452
[sniffles]

1032
01:11:22.495 --> 01:11:24.541
[Maren]
Talking about the future.

1033
01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:26.934
talking about being
a friend to yourself.

1034
01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:29.763
You don't have that.
This is too much.

1035
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:35.769
No. we got
60. 70 years of this?

1036
01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:40.731
How dare you make this harder.

1037
01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:51.916
Maren. what do I...
What am I supposed...

1038
01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:53.787
How do I get you out of this?

1039
01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:54.962
What am I supposed to say
right now?

1040
01:11:57.225 --> 01:11:58.270
Just drive.

1041
01:11:58.879 --> 01:12:01.317
Right. All right.

Uh. do have a telephone book?
The one outside's missing.

1048
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.402
Uh...

1049
01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.709
I'm looking for someone
in Bagley.

the county. sweetie.

[Maren] Thanks.

1053
01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.337
There.

1054
01:13:14.999 --> 01:13:17.088
-I'll come with you.
-No. stay here.

Are you Barbara Kerns?

I've traveled a very long way.

1060
01:13:57.563 --> 01:13:59.260
Oh. they didn't marry.

1061
01:13:59.304 --> 01:14:00.740
Hmm. Yeah. we wondered.

1062
01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.307
Huh.

1063
01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:08.139
My husband. uh.
he died years ago.

1064
01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:09.793
Throat cancer.

1065
01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:12.186
-Sorry.
-Mm.

1066
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.058
Sorry to surprise you
like this.

1067
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.715
You didn't know your daughter
had a child. I guess.

1068
01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.326
No.

1069
01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:23.981
No. When she wanted
to get married.

1070
01:14:24.547 --> 01:14:25.765
we didn't agree.

1071
01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:29.900
So. it drove her away. Yeah.

1072
01:14:32.859 --> 01:14:34.644
Where did she meet my dad?

1073
01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:37.429
He didn't say?

1074
01:14:38.952 --> 01:14:40.780
He wouldn't say
anything about her.

1075
01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:43.043
Ah.

1076
01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:45.959
Hmm. Mm.

1077
01:14:48.092 --> 01:14:49.049
[sighs]

1078
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.496
They met in college.
Down in Mankato.

1079
01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:02.846
She finished two years

1080
01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:04.543
before he talked her
into leaving.

1081
01:15:06.327 --> 01:15:08.678
Did he drive you here?
Is he outside?

1082
01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:11.071
No. He's in Maryland.

1083
01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:16.686
Does he know you're here?

1084
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:18.339
Yeah. he let me know
where to find you.

1085
01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:20.864
So you haven't run away?

1086
01:15:21.473 --> 01:15:22.561
No.

1087
01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:23.693
My dad thinks that

1088
01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:24.955
I'm old enough
to live on my own.

1089
01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:27.610
Oh. Uh-huh.

1090
01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:30.526
Well. if you're looking for
a home with your mother.

1091
01:15:31.875 --> 01:15:32.832
um.

1092
01:15:33.616 --> 01:15:35.748
I'm sorry to tell you

1093
01:15:35.792 --> 01:15:38.229
that she...
she's no longer with us.

1094
01:15:41.232 --> 01:15:42.886
What? When?

1095
01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:44.452
It's a lot of years now.

1096
01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:46.890
and it's nothing
I wanna tell you about.

1097
01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:48.369
I hope you can respect that.

1098
01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:49.545
Well. I'm her daughter.

1099
01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:52.635
Yep. Makes sense now.

1100
01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:56.769
Why she came back so bereaved.
That's the word.

1101
01:15:57.901 --> 01:16:00.164
And she wouldn't tell us
anything. either.

1102
01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:05.430
Oh. it's just so much hiding
in one family.

1103
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:09.303
I'm sorry you had to be
the child of it all.

1104
01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:13.873
Wait. What was
she like as a child?

1105
01:16:16.441 --> 01:16:17.442
Hmm.

1106
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:25.755
Wow. She was your only child?

1107
01:16:25.798 --> 01:16:27.583
[Barbara] Well. not even ours.

1108
01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:30.194
Bob and I never could have
babies of our own.

1109
01:16:31.456 --> 01:16:33.240
But then we heard
about Janelle.

1110
01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:35.591
She'd been left behind

1111
01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:38.158
a sheriff's station
in Bemidji.

1112
01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:40.030
It was in the paper.

1113
01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:42.685
You know anything
about her biological parents?

1114
01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.903
No. nothing.

1115
01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:46.123
Except what they did
to their baby.

1116
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:48.691
I mean. she could have froze.
you know.

1117
01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.475
It's cold here all the time.

1118
01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.348
My mother...

1119
01:16:54.392 --> 01:16:57.003
You can. you know. take those
photos if you want 'em.

1120
01:16:57.047 --> 01:16:58.352
Did she ever hurt anyone?

1121
01:17:00.093 --> 01:17:01.617
What kind of question is that?

1122
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:06.883
I bet she did. I know she did.

1123
01:17:06.926 --> 01:17:08.798
I don't know what you had
to do to cover it up

1124
01:17:08.841 --> 01:17:11.278
or... how much pain
it caused you.

1125
01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.932
Stop this. At once.

1126
01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:15.674
Look. you're never
going to see me again. okay?

1127
01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:19.112
You may not be her family
by blood. but I am.

1128
01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:20.287
And I need to know.

1129
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:23.073
So. please. Mrs. Kerns.
please...

1130
01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:24.640
Then ask her yourself.

1131
01:17:28.295 --> 01:17:29.253
How?

1132
01:17:32.038 --> 01:17:32.952
[sighs]

1133
01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:36.347
Look. I don't know you.

1134
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:37.783
You gotta understand.

1135
01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:40.003
I didn't know what you wanted
comin' up here.

1136
01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:41.395
And I hope you mean
what you say

1137
01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:43.571
about never coming back here.

1138
01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:48.359
I know that sounds cold.
but I wanna be clear with ya.

1139
01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:50.578
I told you she was
no longer with us.

1140
01:17:50.622 --> 01:17:53.059
but she's not...
she's not dead.

1141
01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:58.325
She's living in a town
called Fergus Falls.

1142
01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:00.458
In a state hospital there.

1143
01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.852
And we didn't put her there.

1144
01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:04.549
if that's what
you're thinkin'.

1145
01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:06.594
She signed her own papers.

1146
01:18:06.638 --> 01:18:07.552
[door opens]

1147
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:10.511
[door closes]

1148
01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:20.347
[panting] Okay.

1149
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.925
Here. My mother's here.

1150
01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:14.662
Do you want me to come in?

1151
01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:16.447
No.

1152
01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:40.906
[nurse] Mrs. Kerns' daughter.

1153
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.953
I sure didn't expect this
when I woke up this morning.

1154
01:19:45.737 --> 01:19:47.086
[muffled shouting]

1155
01:19:48.435 --> 01:19:49.828
[woman screaming]

1156
01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.177
[woman 2] Calm down.

1157
01:19:53.658 --> 01:19:54.702
Calm down.

1158
01:19:55.399 --> 01:19:57.836
Is she dangerous?

1159
01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.230
It's been many years
since that was a concern.

1160
01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:02.058
[woman 3 crying]

1161
01:20:03.973 --> 01:20:05.322
Why was it ever one?

1162
01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:08.499
Aggression towards the staff.
Self-harm.

1163
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.762
But long ago.

1164
01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:14.853
[keys jingling]

1165
01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:17.247
It's possible she won't
understand who you are.

1166
01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:19.902
She just took
her morning meds.

1167
01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.642
so she may nod off anyhow.

1168
01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:24.254
We'll see.

1169
01:20:24.297 --> 01:20:26.430
There's someone here
to see you. Ms. Kerns.

1170
01:20:26.473 --> 01:20:29.389
A surprise.
A wonderful surprise.

1171
01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:55.676
[Maren] It's Maren.

1172
01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:58.418
I'm Maren.

1173
01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:04.903
Can't she speak?

1174
01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:06.078
It's the medication.

1175
01:21:07.775 --> 01:21:10.213
[whimpers. breathing shakily]

1176
01:21:10.256 --> 01:21:11.997
Easy. Ms. Kerns.

1177
01:21:16.436 --> 01:21:17.960
I didn't come with Dad.

1178
01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:22.703
I didn't come with Dad.
Just came by myself.

1179
01:21:25.271 --> 01:21:26.577
Should I give her
the letter. Ms. Kerns?

1180
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.970
I fetched it on the way up.

1181
01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:30.015
[whimpering]

1182
01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:38.545
She wrote this about
15 years ago now. must be.

1183
01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:41.940
I've kept it safe in her file
out there. in case.

1184
01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:49.992
She knew I'd come?

1185
01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.082
I'll wait right over here.

1186
01:22:06.095 --> 01:22:11.317
[Janelle] Maren. if a day comes
when you show up here.

1187
01:22:11.361 --> 01:22:15.104
I'll know it's because
your father broke his promise.

1188
01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:18.020
Told you something about me.

1189
01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:21.632
And I'll know why.

1190
01:22:21.675 --> 01:22:24.678
He didn't know what I was
when we married.

1191
01:22:24.722 --> 01:22:28.639
but he figured it out
by the time I had you.

1192
01:22:28.682 --> 01:22:31.772
I promised I would never hurt
either of you.

1193
01:22:31.816 --> 01:22:35.080
but how could we be sure?

1194
01:22:35.124 --> 01:22:38.954
It wasn't easy to leave.
I loved you both so much.

1195
01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:40.912
I thought about
ending my life.

1196
01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:45.569
but I wanted to be here
in case you ever did come.

1197
01:22:47.049 --> 01:22:50.400
All I ever wanted
in this world was love.

1198
01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:53.011
I tried. believed.

1199
01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:55.448
but we can't have it
as we are.

1200
01:22:55.492 --> 01:22:57.973
All we can have
is a little space.

1201
01:22:58.016 --> 01:23:02.238
with bars or a door
that locks.

1202
01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:05.241
[tearfully] I'm sorry
for that. Little Yearly.

1203
01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:09.680
For all the things
I didn't do for you

1204
01:23:09.723 --> 01:23:13.553
and for the one thing
I still can.

1205
01:23:14.424 --> 01:23:15.903
The world of love

1206
01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:18.515
-wants no monsters in it.
-[breathing heavily]

1207
01:23:23.607 --> 01:23:25.609
So let me help you out of it.

1208
01:23:25.652 --> 01:23:27.828
-[growling]
-[Maren gasping]

1209
01:23:31.615 --> 01:23:32.877
[Maren] No! Help me!

1210
01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.835
Ms. Kerns. calm down!

1211
01:23:35.619 --> 01:23:37.490
Maren. die.

1212
01:23:39.275 --> 01:23:40.319
[Maren] Let me out. Let me out.

1213
01:23:40.363 --> 01:23:42.060
Press the button
on the door. Go!

1214
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:45.455
[gasping]

1215
01:23:45.498 --> 01:23:48.023
[blubbering]

1216
01:23:52.114 --> 01:23:53.289
[door rattling]

1217
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.901
I can't open the door.
I can't open the door.

1218
01:23:56.944 --> 01:23:58.207
[Lee] Sorry. sorry.
Here we go. here we go.

1219
01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:00.513
[Maren] I can't
fucking with the door.

1220
01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:01.862
[Lee] You're good.

1221
01:24:01.906 --> 01:24:03.821
[Maren] She's one of us.

1222
01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:05.301
She's one of us
but she's fucking nuts.

1223
01:24:05.344 --> 01:24:07.129
She ate her own fucking hands.

1224
01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:08.304
She said she loved my dad.

1225
01:24:08.347 --> 01:24:09.827
She said she wanted
to be a mom.

1226
01:24:10.828 --> 01:24:12.177
She could have stayed.

1227
01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.571
She could have told me
what I needed to know.

1228
01:24:14.614 --> 01:24:16.138
But all of this...
Fuck. you know how different

1229
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:18.488
this would've been if I'd had
one person on my side?

1230
01:24:18.531 --> 01:24:20.664
One person to talk to?

1231
01:24:20.707 --> 01:24:22.100
You know what
I wouldn't have done?

1232
01:24:22.144 --> 01:24:24.581
Maybe. probably half
of what I've fucking done!

1233
01:24:25.495 --> 01:24:27.105
Fuck her. Fuck.

1234
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:29.151
[Lee] You know.
if she'd stayed.

1235
01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:31.240
she might have hurt you.
Maren. Or worse. you might not
even be here right now.

1236
01:24:33.111 --> 01:24:34.852
Trust me. I know what I'm
talking about with this stuff.

1237
01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:36.549
This is better than
what I went through.

1238
01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:38.290
Please just stop
fucking talking!

1239
01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:41.989
You're pissed off.
and you're scared.
and you feel alone.

1240
01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:43.643
and you don't know what to do
with it all. it's fine.

1241
01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:45.950
If you wanna go at yourself
with that. I can't stop you.

1242
01:24:46.733 --> 01:24:47.734
But don't come at me.

1243
01:24:48.909 --> 01:24:51.173
You slit his throat. Lee.

1244
01:24:51.216 --> 01:24:53.610
-He had a wife. Kids.
-Okay.

1245
01:24:53.653 --> 01:24:55.438
I think you got used
to being locked up

1246
01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:57.266
and invisible and alone.
and now you're
out in the world...

1247
01:24:57.309 --> 01:24:58.789
-Okay. okay.
-...and you're seeing yourself

1248
01:24:58.832 --> 01:25:01.096
for the first time.
and that's freaking you out.

1249
01:25:01.139 --> 01:25:03.141
But you know what?
It's fucking me up too. okay?

1250
01:25:03.185 --> 01:25:05.012
I feel like
I'm seeing myself too.
That's how this works.

1251
01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:06.623
-How what works?
-This!

1252
01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:07.667
Whatever this is.

1253
01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:13.151
Stop. You're wrong.
you're wrong.

1254
01:25:13.195 --> 01:25:14.631
What? About which part
am I wrong?

1255
01:25:14.674 --> 01:25:17.112
I can't be around you anymore.
I can't think.

1256
01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:18.722
Jesus Christ.

1257
01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:20.376
We don't have
many options. Maren.

1258
01:25:20.419 --> 01:25:22.334
Either you eat.
you off yourself.

1259
01:25:22.378 --> 01:25:24.206
or you lock yourself up
like her in there.

1260
01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:25.207
What's it gonna be?

1261
01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:28.514
Why can't you
let me have this?

1262
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.387
[sighs]

1263
01:25:35.217 --> 01:25:36.174
No.

1264
01:25:38.002 --> 01:25:41.310
I'm not going to be her.
I'm not going to be her.

1265
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.486
You can decide no.

1266
01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:46.402
And I'm deciding that
right fucking now.

1267
01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.249
I'm just getting gas.

1268
01:26:53.295 --> 01:26:54.252
You have the money.

1269
01:26:58.909 --> 01:27:00.084
[Lee sighs]

1270
01:28:11.155 --> 01:28:12.199
[Lee] Maren!

1271
01:28:15.377 --> 01:28:16.552
Maren!

Hey. hey.

1278
01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:38.982
You ain't sad to see
old Sully. are you. missy?

1279
01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:42.202
It worked out. [chuckling]

1280
01:29:42.855 --> 01:29:44.204
I hardly believe it.

1281
01:29:46.598 --> 01:29:48.383
You've been following me
since Frederick?

1282
01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:50.167
[laughs]

1283
01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:53.953
I know.
It seems crazy to me too. I...

1284
01:29:53.997 --> 01:29:56.956
I just didn't... I didn't know
what else to do.

1285
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.088
Why. Sully?

1286
01:29:59.306 --> 01:30:01.396
Well. because we...

1287
01:30:01.439 --> 01:30:04.964
we didn't have a chance
to say our goodbyes.

1288
01:30:05.008 --> 01:30:08.620
And I've been worrying on you
on your own as you are.

1289
01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:12.232
Why not say hello
earlier then?

1290
01:30:12.276 --> 01:30:14.452
Oh. no. no. missy. I don't...

1291
01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:16.454
I don't interrupt.
That's bad manners.

1292
01:30:16.498 --> 01:30:18.238
and you were with a friend.

1293
01:30:18.282 --> 01:30:21.503
And where'd he go now?
I saw him.

1294
01:30:21.546 --> 01:30:24.157
Took off out of here fast.

1295
01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:26.464
Is he your new boyfriend?
Is he?

1296
01:30:26.508 --> 01:30:27.813
[Maren] No. no. no.

1297
01:30:27.857 --> 01:30:30.207
Or just a hobo
you're hanging around with?

1298
01:30:30.903 --> 01:30:32.557
No. I'm just a friend.

1299
01:30:32.601 --> 01:30:34.211
Oh. just a friend.

1300
01:30:34.254 --> 01:30:37.083
Maybe he didn't get
that telegram.

1301
01:30:40.347 --> 01:30:41.523
He one of us?

1302
01:30:48.878 --> 01:30:51.620
Follow your nose
or he follow his?

1303
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:55.450
-[Maren] Both.
-[laughing]

1304
01:30:55.493 --> 01:30:56.929
Thanks for showing me how.

1305
01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:58.235
[continues laughing]

1306
01:31:00.193 --> 01:31:02.195
Hey. count the bugs.

1307
01:31:04.415 --> 01:31:06.852
Well. life's never dully
with Sully.

1308
01:31:06.896 --> 01:31:08.375
What do you say? Uh...

1309
01:31:09.725 --> 01:31:12.771
What do you say?
You wanna. uh.

1310
01:31:12.815 --> 01:31:14.860
take a ride with Sully
for a bit?

1311
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:20.126
It's weird that
you've been following me.

1312
01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:21.519
It's only been
a couple of weeks.

1313
01:31:21.563 --> 01:31:24.479
Life will get weirder.
I promise. I promise.

1314
01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:28.178
I liked...

1315
01:31:32.008 --> 01:31:34.880
I liked our talk.

1316
01:31:34.924 --> 01:31:39.885
Oh. it's a hard and lonesome
road for us. isn't it?

1317
01:31:39.929 --> 01:31:43.498
So. there's no sense
in making it lonelier

1318
01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:45.500
[stammering]
if you don't have to.

1319
01:31:46.413 --> 01:31:47.806
-I'm a girl.
-I know.

1320
01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.242
About my daughter's age.

1321
01:31:49.286 --> 01:31:50.548
if I had one. [chuckles]

1322
01:31:51.984 --> 01:31:52.942
Is that what this is?

1323
01:31:57.337 --> 01:31:58.382
[sighs]

1324
01:32:00.297 --> 01:32:01.646
How do you like that?

1325
01:32:04.214 --> 01:32:09.219
Sully. I'm not trying
to upset you. Mm-hmm.

1326
01:32:09.262 --> 01:32:12.483
Just. I know
you drove a long way.

1327
01:32:15.007 --> 01:32:17.488
I don't feel
comfortable with this.

1328
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:20.535
You've never fit
with someone before?

1329
01:32:21.753 --> 01:32:22.667
I have.

1330
01:32:23.712 --> 01:32:25.975
It's just gotta go both ways.

1331

[sighs]

1332
01:32:37.769 --> 01:32:39.249
You don't like Sully.

1333
01:32:40.642 --> 01:32:41.773
Why do you say your name

1334
01:32:41.817 --> 01:32:42.731
like you're
two different people?

1335
01:32:42.774 --> 01:32:44.384
You don't like me.

1336
01:32:44.428 --> 01:32:46.212
No. I don't trust you.

1337
01:32:46.256 --> 01:32:49.041
It doesn't matter if I'm right
or if I'm wrong about that.

1338
01:32:49.085 --> 01:32:50.695
it just matters
that I feel it.

1339
01:32:53.219 --> 01:32:55.134
So you're not gettin' in?

1340
01:32:57.223 --> 01:32:58.224
Not gettin' in.

1341
01:33:03.969 --> 01:33:07.233
Fuck you. then.

1342
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:12.891
Fuck you. missy.

1343
01:33:16.808 --> 01:33:18.593
You dumb cunt!

1344
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.817
I...

1345
01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:30.692
I dried off next to you.

1346
01:33:32.563 --> 01:33:37.394
I've never done that
with anyone before.

1347
01:33:40.223 --> 01:33:42.007
That means something.

1348
01:33:47.883 --> 01:33:50.015

You sound weird.

01:38:19.415 --> 01:38:21.460
I'm Maren. Lee's friend.

1408
01:38:21.504 --> 01:38:23.593
I met you at your aunt's house
a couple of months back.

1409
01:38:25.551 --> 01:38:26.465
I remember.

1410
01:38:27.989 --> 01:38:29.425
I'll talk to y'all
in a minute.

1411
01:38:31.122 --> 01:38:33.385
[Maren] Yeah. I wanted
to say hi then. but...

1412
01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:36.954
Do you know where Lee is?

1413
01:38:38.173 --> 01:38:40.001
He was at my aunt's house
for a while.

1414
01:38:40.044 --> 01:38:42.438
but my mom
wouldn't leave him alone.

1415
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.657
so he took his tent
and moved out to the lake.

1416
01:38:45.615 --> 01:38:47.008
Which lake?

1417
01:38:47.051 --> 01:38:48.923
Um. Land Between the Lakes.

1418
01:38:48.966 --> 01:38:50.663
It's a state park down 641.

1419
01:38:52.448 --> 01:38:54.189
He comes into town
when he wants to.

1420
01:38:54.885 --> 01:38:55.842
Well. he's just...

1421
01:38:57.018 --> 01:38:58.323
going through something.
I guess.

1422
01:38:59.846 --> 01:39:01.674
But I asked him about you

1423
01:39:01.718 --> 01:39:03.067
and he just said that
you went another way.

1424
01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:06.114
I wondered
why he's been staying.

1425
01:39:06.157 --> 01:39:08.203
I guess he was hoping
that you'd show up. right?

1426
01:39:10.683 --> 01:39:12.163
No. I don't know about that.

1427
01:39:13.512 --> 01:39:15.558
I don't know if he'd actually
even want to see me.

1428
01:39:16.211 --> 01:39:17.690
to be honest.

1429
01:39:17.734 --> 01:39:19.388
I know he was trying
to get back to you. though.

1430
01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:21.956
He said that?

1431
01:39:23.261 --> 01:39:26.003
[chuckles]
God. he's an asshole.

1432
01:39:26.047 --> 01:39:27.831
Why is he even like this.
you know?

1433
01:39:27.874 --> 01:39:29.311
I tell him no one
even remembers

1434
01:39:29.354 --> 01:39:31.791
all that stuff
with the cops anymore.

1435
01:39:31.835 --> 01:39:34.446
It was three stupid days
and they let him go.

1436
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:35.621
This is about your dad?

1437
01:39:36.796 --> 01:39:37.972
He didn't tell you?

1438
01:39:40.887 --> 01:39:42.454
Our dad's a drunk.

1439
01:39:42.498 --> 01:39:46.023
So drunk that he'd piss
on the wall kinda guy.

1440
01:39:46.067 --> 01:39:47.982
He got in Lee's face
a couple of times

1441
01:39:48.025 --> 01:39:49.548
and Lee would. you know.
try to calm him down.

1442
01:39:49.592 --> 01:39:52.421
and the day he left.
he wound up hitting Lee.

1443
01:39:52.464 --> 01:39:55.293
And when I tried to
break 'em up. he hit me. too.

1444
01:39:57.426 --> 01:39:58.557
Lee just lost it.

1445
01:39:58.601 --> 01:40:00.864
and he told me
to call the cops.

1446
01:40:00.907 --> 01:40:03.649
And when our dad ripped
the phone out of the wall.

1447
01:40:03.693 --> 01:40:06.087
Lee got him in a headlock.
He told me to run into town.

1448
01:40:07.958 --> 01:40:09.655
And when I got back
with the cops.

1449
01:40:09.699 --> 01:40:12.963
Lee was pretty beat up
and Dad's car was gone.

1450
01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:14.225
And Lee told 'em
that he took off.

1451
01:40:14.269 --> 01:40:16.271
but there was blood on Lee.

1452
01:40:16.314 --> 01:40:17.707
so they had to put him
in a holding cell

1453
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:19.491
so they could test it.

1454
01:40:19.535 --> 01:40:22.538
And for a minute there.
everyone was like.

1455
01:40:22.581 --> 01:40:24.583
"Lee killed him.
Lee killed him."

1456
01:40:24.627 --> 01:40:26.237
But it was all Lee's blood.

1457
01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:28.109
It was all bullshit.
and they had to let him go.

1458
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:31.068
And that was four years ago.

1459
01:40:31.112 --> 01:40:33.244
and he's been out of town
for three and a half of 'em.

1460
01:40:34.767 --> 01:40:35.812
It's not fair.

1461
01:40:37.466 --> 01:40:38.902
It's not fair.

1462
01:40:38.945 --> 01:40:40.338
[children chattering]

1463
01:40:42.471 --> 01:40:43.472
[Maren] Lee!

1464
01:41:21.118 --> 01:41:22.902
-[fireworks exploding]
-[dog barking]

1465
01:41:22.946 --> 01:41:24.426
-[people exclaiming]
-[Maren] Your tent.

1466
01:41:24.469 --> 01:41:27.081
We should really use it.
Just get lost.

1467
01:41:28.169 --> 01:41:29.170
[Lee] Where do you want to go?

1468
01:41:31.085 --> 01:41:34.262
I don't know. Anywhere.
West. Let's go west.

1469
01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:47.188
[laughs]

1470
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:21.831
[mechanic]
It's your rod bearings then.

1471
01:42:21.874 --> 01:42:23.920
[Lee] Seriously? Shit!

1472
01:42:23.963 --> 01:42:25.182
That means a new engine.

1473
01:42:25.226 --> 01:42:27.184
I'd rather just sell it
for parts.

1474
01:42:27.228 --> 01:42:29.578
Tell you what.
you make me a good offer.
I'll sell it to you right now.

1475
01:42:29.839 --> 01:42:31.623
[splutters] You don't
want to sell it out here.

1476
01:42:31.667 --> 01:42:33.147
-[Lee] Why?
-Look around. man.

1477
01:42:34.887 --> 01:42:35.888
How you gonna get home?

1478
01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.064
I don't know.

1479
01:43:10.445 --> 01:43:11.837
You do go someplace else.

1480
01:43:13.274 --> 01:43:14.405
[Maren] Watching me read?

1481
01:43:14.449 --> 01:43:15.319
[Lee] Yeah.

1482
01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:20.672
[Maren] Well. you should know
after this. I'm out of books.

1483
01:43:20.716 --> 01:43:22.805
I'll have to go
to a bookstore.

1484
01:43:22.848 --> 01:43:24.850
[Lee] May have to stop
on the way back. in Omaha.

1485
01:43:26.287 --> 01:43:27.592
By the way.
those guys were saying

1486
01:43:27.636 --> 01:43:29.855
we should have two days
of water with us

1487
01:43:29.899 --> 01:43:32.118
in case the engine gives out.

1488
01:43:32.162 --> 01:43:33.468
In case we have
to wait on a ride.

1489
01:43:36.035 --> 01:43:38.124
We should get some new wheels
as soon as we can.

1490
01:43:39.735 --> 01:43:41.302
I wish we could save it.

1491
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.130
I'd rather have a van. anyway.

1492
01:43:45.262 --> 01:43:47.133
I learned how to drive
in that truck.

1493
01:43:47.177 --> 01:43:48.613
You learned how to kiss
in that truck.

1494
01:43:50.006 --> 01:43:52.878
I knew how to kiss before you.
Mr. Kentucky.

1495
01:43:52.922 --> 01:43:53.749
Ah.

1496
01:44:02.453 --> 01:44:04.020
I sang to my girl
in that truck.

1497
01:44:26.042 --> 01:44:27.261
Kayla told me about...

1498
01:44:28.697 --> 01:44:29.959
what happened with your dad.

1499
01:44:32.527 --> 01:44:33.832
Kayla doesn't know
what happened.

1500
01:44:35.617 --> 01:44:37.401
He sounds like
he was a fucking asshole.

1501
01:44:37.445 --> 01:44:38.359
[Lee] I don't wanna...

1502
01:44:39.925 --> 01:44:41.144
I don't want to talk
about my dad.

1503
01:44:42.624 --> 01:44:44.582
I don't sweat this stuff out
like you do.

1504
01:44:51.415 --> 01:44:53.809
You know.
Kayla said that he...

1505
01:44:55.332 --> 01:44:57.291
that he hit you both
the day that he left.

1506
01:44:58.204 --> 01:44:59.162
That's true.

1507
01:45:02.818 --> 01:45:04.341
Told her to get the cops.
She did.

1508
01:45:06.387 --> 01:45:07.301
And then he left.

1509
01:45:11.043 --> 01:45:13.655
I don't know. I don't
really believe that. I mean.

1510
01:45:13.698 --> 01:45:16.179
there must've been
a lot of blood on you
for the cops to bring you in.

1511
01:45:16.222 --> 01:45:19.095
If you wanna know. Maren.
he came for me. okay?

1512
01:45:19.138 --> 01:45:20.575
He tried to rip me open
with his teeth.

1513
01:45:25.536 --> 01:45:27.538
That's the first time
I ever smelled it on someone.

1514
01:45:47.253 --> 01:45:48.342
What happened after that?

1515
01:45:52.215 --> 01:45:53.390
[Lee sighs]

1516
01:45:55.871 --> 01:45:56.785
Lee.

1517
01:45:57.873 --> 01:45:59.004
you can tell me.

1518
01:46:03.835 --> 01:46:06.055
[Lee sighs. tuts]

1519
01:46:06.098 --> 01:46:08.187
[exhales heavily] He. uh...

1520
01:46:08.231 --> 01:46:09.232
He passed out.

1521
01:46:11.974 --> 01:46:15.412
I got him in a... I put him
in a fucking... [sniffles]

1522
01:46:15.456 --> 01:46:19.329
headlock. and bashed
an ashtray over his head.

1523
01:46:22.463 --> 01:46:24.639
Dragged his fucking body
to his car.

1524
01:46:25.944 --> 01:46:27.032
Put him in the car.

1525
01:46:28.512 --> 01:46:31.297
and I drove to this barn
about a mile outside town

1526
01:46:31.341 --> 01:46:32.429
that I knew was abandoned.

1527
01:46:36.477 --> 01:46:37.565
[sniffles]

1528
01:46:40.481 --> 01:46:41.917
How long was he in the barn?

1529
01:46:50.142 --> 01:46:51.405
Uh. three days.

1530
01:46:52.536 --> 01:46:53.755
I think. yeah.

1531
01:46:59.978 --> 01:47:01.023
Three days.

1532
01:47:07.595 --> 01:47:09.205
I duct-taped the shit
out of him too.

1533
01:47:09.248 --> 01:47:10.772
Everywhere
except his nostrils.

1534
01:47:10.815 --> 01:47:11.686
so he could breathe.

1535
01:47:16.952 --> 01:47:19.041
And when
I finally came back...

1536
01:47:21.217 --> 01:47:22.479
It's the sound he was making.

1537
01:47:22.523 --> 01:47:24.046
it's the noise
and the breathing.

1538
01:47:27.745 --> 01:47:29.268
He knew what was gonna happen.

1539
01:47:32.837 --> 01:47:34.012
[exhales heavily]

1540
01:47:38.974 --> 01:47:40.062
[Maren sniffles]

1541
01:47:44.632 --> 01:47:45.633
What did you do?

1542
01:47:48.853 --> 01:47:50.464
I ate him right the fuck up.

1543
01:47:52.727 --> 01:47:54.250
And it felt fucking great.

1544
01:47:55.556 --> 01:47:58.950
I felt high as a motherfucker.
[inhales sharply]

1545
01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:12.921
Probably would have
killed myself

1546
01:48:12.964 --> 01:48:13.965
if it weren't for Kayla.

1547
01:48:18.927 --> 01:48:20.058
I feel like I should have.
you know.

1548
01:48:20.102 --> 01:48:22.583
No. No. stop.

1549
01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:25.150
[Lee breathes heavily]

1550
01:48:26.587 --> 01:48:28.023
I would have done
the same thing.

1551
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:30.634
I would have done
the same thing.

1552
01:48:32.636 --> 01:48:33.376
-Do you mean it?
-I would have done it in my way
but I would have done it.

1553
01:48:37.598 --> 01:48:39.513
You protected the people
that you love.

1554
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.303
You don't think
I'm a bad person?

1555
01:48:54.266 --> 01:48:56.181
All I think is that
I love you.

1556
01:49:00.577 --> 01:49:02.405
[Lee breathes shakily]

1557
01:49:10.108 --> 01:49:11.632
[Lee exhales deeply]

1558
01:49:14.156 --> 01:49:15.461
[Lee sniffles]

1559
01:49:17.028 --> 01:49:18.726
[Lee crying]

1560
01:49:51.672 --> 01:49:53.108
[Maren] Where do we go next?

1561
01:49:54.283 --> 01:49:55.240
[Lee] Anywhere.

1562
01:49:56.241 --> 01:49:57.939
[Maren] Let's drive back.

1563
01:49:57.982 --> 01:49:59.723
Until the truck
gives out somewhere.

1564
01:50:00.985 --> 01:50:03.509
And then just stay.

1565
01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:07.035
We can get a place. jobs.

1566
01:50:07.949 --> 01:50:09.994
You know. like people do.

1567
01:50:10.038 --> 01:50:13.084
[Lee] You wanna be people?
Let's be people.

1568
01:50:13.128 --> 01:50:15.870
[Maren] Yeah.
Let's be them for a while.

1569
01:50:21.919 --> 01:50:23.138
[Lee] Yeah.
we're in Ann Arbor now.

1570
01:50:24.008 --> 01:50:25.270
Ann Arbor.

1571
01:50:25.314 --> 01:50:26.707
Maren got a job
at the university.

1572
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:29.187
at the bookstore.
so. we're right near campus.

1573
01:50:33.757 --> 01:50:34.715
What'd you say?

1574
01:50:37.326 --> 01:50:38.806
Yeah. maybe if
we're here long enough.

1575
01:50:38.849 --> 01:50:40.024
Hey. Kayla says hi.

1576
01:50:41.025 --> 01:50:42.636
-Hi.
-Maren says hi.

1577
01:50:42.679 --> 01:50:44.463
-She wants to come up.
-Yeah.

1578
01:50:46.161 --> 01:50:47.902
[indistinct chatter]

1579
01:51:21.979 --> 01:51:23.502
[indistinct chatter]

1580
01:51:29.595 --> 01:51:32.207
Lee. I brought your...

1581
01:51:35.166 --> 01:51:36.124
[sighs]

1582
01:52:04.718 --> 01:52:06.023
[breathes deeply]

1583
01:52:10.071 --> 01:52:12.508
-[Maren whimpering]
-[shushing]

1584
01:52:20.995 --> 01:52:22.692
[Sully breathing heavily]

1585
01:52:22.736 --> 01:52:24.955
I'm gonna take my hand away.

1586
01:52:26.217 --> 01:52:27.784
and you're not gonna scream.

1587
01:52:28.785 --> 01:52:30.656
Because Sully's a friend

1588
01:52:31.701 --> 01:52:34.051
and we don't scream
at friends.

1589
01:52:38.099 --> 01:52:39.361
[gasping]

1590
01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:48.674
Where's your...
Where's your cutie-pie?

1591
01:52:48.718 --> 01:52:50.024
[laughing]

1592
01:52:50.807 --> 01:52:52.853
I saw him.

1593
01:52:52.896 --> 01:52:56.770
I saw him walk out of here
half an hour ago.

1594
01:52:58.859 --> 01:52:59.773
I don't know.

1595
01:53:03.385 --> 01:53:05.169
What's all this for. Sully?

1596
01:53:10.044 --> 01:53:11.306
Ever...

1597
01:53:11.349 --> 01:53:14.439
Ever since I drove away
from you.

1598
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:17.268
up there in Minnesota.

1599
01:53:18.879 --> 01:53:20.489
nothing's felt right.

1600
01:53:23.448 --> 01:53:24.928
[Maren] What does that mean?

1601
01:53:28.497 --> 01:53:29.454
[smacks lips]

1602
01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:31.152
It means...

1603
01:53:35.721 --> 01:53:37.811
[breathes heavily]

1604
01:53:37.854 --> 01:53:38.855
It means...

1605
01:53:41.379 --> 01:53:43.120
It mean... It...

1606
01:53:43.164 --> 01:53:47.255
It means unfinished business.

1607
01:53:53.130 --> 01:53:55.829
Sully. me and Lee...

1608
01:53:59.745 --> 01:54:00.703
we are together now.

1609
01:54:01.312 --> 01:54:02.661
[Maren gasps]

1610
01:54:02.705 --> 01:54:05.186
That's not the business
I'm talkin' about.

1611
01:54:13.759 --> 01:54:15.849
I don't mind.

1612
01:54:15.892 --> 01:54:19.200
I don't... I don't mind
if you don't like Sully.

1613
01:54:21.376 --> 01:54:26.511
What I mind is how much
you know about him

1614
01:54:26.555 --> 01:54:28.600
in that little head of yours.

1615
01:54:30.298 --> 01:54:32.691
You don't think
I'd tell anyone. right?

1616
01:54:32.735 --> 01:54:34.780
[Sully groans]

1617
01:54:34.824 --> 01:54:36.695
I mean. who would believe me?

1618
01:54:36.739 --> 01:54:37.827
[Sully groans]

1619
01:54:40.177 --> 01:54:44.268
And you're the one who told me
you don't kill any...

1620
01:54:45.661 --> 01:54:47.619
You don't kill. right?

1621
01:54:47.663 --> 01:54:48.882
You told me that. Sully.

1622
01:54:48.925 --> 01:54:50.492
You know. I told...

1623
01:54:50.535 --> 01:54:54.322
I used to try and tell people
the truth. you know.

1624
01:54:57.673 --> 01:54:59.544
They never took me serious.

1625
01:55:02.547 --> 01:55:03.722
[Sully sighs]

1626
01:55:08.205 --> 01:55:10.468
I just wanted to be...

1627
01:55:10.512 --> 01:55:13.602
I just wanted to be with
someone who understood.

1628
01:55:14.429 --> 01:55:15.647
Do you know what I mean?

1629
01:55:18.563 --> 01:55:19.477
Do you?

1630
01:55:20.478 --> 01:55:21.392
Mm.

1631
01:55:22.828 --> 01:55:23.829
Mm.

1632
01:55:24.395 --> 01:55:25.919
[sniffling]

1633
01:55:26.876 --> 01:55:27.833
Hmm.

1634
01:55:31.359 --> 01:55:32.447
[Sully grunts softly]

1635
01:55:33.491 --> 01:55:34.753
[door opens quietly]

1636
01:55:42.892 --> 01:55:43.893
[Maren] Hey.

1637
01:55:44.807 --> 01:55:46.765
You never get sick
of yourself?

1638
01:55:54.556 --> 01:55:57.037
Sully just wants
to sleep at night.

1639
01:55:57.863 --> 01:55:58.908
That's all.

1640
01:56:02.172 --> 01:56:03.869
Sully just wants to sleep.

1641
01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.568
Sleep it off.

1642
01:56:08.004 --> 01:56:09.049
I said.

1643
01:56:09.919 --> 01:56:13.749
stop calling yourself Sully.

1644
01:56:13.792 --> 01:56:14.968
Shh!

1645

[Lee] That's the man you met.

I smelled him two blocks
from here.
