00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:32.261

00:00:49.343 --> 00:00:52.510
(hand brake creaking)

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.886

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:11.395

(door bangs)

12
00:03:55.514 --> 00:03:57.665
- What's up mijo?

13
00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:58.962
What you got there?

14
00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:00.997
Ahh Mexican Mafia encyclopedia.

15
00:04:00.997 --> 00:04:02.263
that's a good book.

16
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.413
Ernest Roybal.

17
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.843
He looks familiar.
(chuckling)

18
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.260
- You were a lot younger then.

19
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.913
- Yeah. we were some crazy vatos.

20
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.522
- I Learned more about you and
your friends from this book.

21
00:04:23.522 --> 00:04:25.790
than I did from you.
(dog barking)

22
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.937
The church choir knows
more about you than I do.

23
00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:30.140
(dog barking)

24
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.513
- I did a lot of things I'm not proud of.

25
00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:34.690
I spent 40 years of my life

26
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.130
in some of the toughest
prisons in the United States.

27
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.543
for multiple murders and armed robberies.

28
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.323
But in the end I woke up.

29
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.440
- Tell me your story. dad.

30
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.723
- Los Angeles was a gang capital.

31
00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:00.246
And I was young and dumb.

32
00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:02.746

43
00:05:44.382 --> 00:05:45.582
- I didn't say anything.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.080
I swear.

45
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.240
- Just tell us what you told them.

46
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.530
so we could do damage control.

47
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.803

(plane engine roaring)

76
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.267
My father went off to
fight in World War II

77
00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:24.963
and my mom couldn't handle me.

78
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.530
So my abuelita.
(guns firing)

79
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.150
she tried to take care of me.
(arms blasting)

80
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.243
She would tie me up with a rope.

81
00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:35.493
(plane engine roaring)

82
00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:39.299
(car horn blaring)

83
00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:40.791
- You can get out of the ropes.

84
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.759
Let's see you try to get out of these.

85
00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.692
(chain clinking)

86
00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:44.525
- What'd he do this time?

87
00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:45.460
- He crashed the car.

88
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.423
Don't ask.

89
00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.320
- But I couldn't blame her.

90
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.153
I was a terror.

91
00:07:52.153 --> 00:07:54.360
I was fighting everybody in my path.

92
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.665
I was just causing destruction.

93
00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:57.713
(tense upbeat music)

94
00:07:57.713 --> 00:07:58.820
(footsteps pattering)

95
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.750
- Check this out. man. made this for you.

96
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.550
Anytime you're angry. lay
your rage out on this.

97
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.700
Let's see what you got.

98
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.875
- My uncle made a punching bag for me

99
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:11.192
and it was a God send.

100
00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:12.707
Stacked this thing into a bag.

101
00:08:12.707 --> 00:08:16.350
and all my anger and
energy. I just laid into it.

102
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.190
The bad part was I turned
into a good fighter.

103
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.210
I became a teenager.

104
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.393
I didn't fear nobody and I
just would take on anybody.

105
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:28.650
- We've got a winner here.

106
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.900
I heard he's a heartbreaker.
loaded with talent.

107
00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:34.180
But he will wind in prison.

108
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.743
like so many of our boys do.

109
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.753
Invest your time in someone else.

110
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.290
- What are you talking about?

111
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.133
He can become a champion and
get the respect of the world.

112
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:49.071
- Hmph. not the respect of
the world he's gonna want.

113
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:50.790
He is gonna want the
respect of his neighborhood.

114
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.810
- I got recruited by the local
gyms. to fight their fighters

115
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.310
and actually could have done pretty good

116
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.560
if I went down that road.

117
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.121
Maybe I was too busy in pharmaceuticals.

118
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:04.961
being a salesman.

119
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:08.378
(punching ball bouncing)

120
00:09:10.906 --> 00:09:13.490
- Man. you got a real shot
in the boxing world. Roy.

121
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.543
If you can just stay out of trouble.

122
00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:17.150
- (pants) Hey. trouble fights me coach.

123
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.750
- Yeah. prison's gonna find you too.

124
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.592
You're gotta straighten up.

125
00:09:21.592 --> 00:09:23.733
- (indistinct) We did it though.

126
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.660
- You did well.I liked the
way you kept moving your head.

127
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.660
get your hands up. very good.

128
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.530
Very good.

129
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.363
- Thanks coach.

130
00:09:33.627 --> 00:09:36.020
What's up. when's the next fight?

131
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.520
- Son. take your time.

132
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.858
- Ready now.

133
00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:40.103
- I found family in

134
00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:43.570
one of the oldest gangs in
Los Angeles. White Fence.

135
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.340
And the founders called it that because.

136
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.450
we used to hang out in front
of the Purisima Church.

137
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.320
and it was surrounded by a white fence.

138
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.400
even though we were involved
in wholesome sports.

139
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.727
like boxing or baseball. we
were still the hooligans.

140
00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:59.120
And we'd really like
to go to school dances

141
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.807
but not to dance with the girls.

142
00:10:00.807 --> 00:10:03.460
it was to fight with the vatos.

143
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.930
Primera Flats and VNE.

144
00:10:12.644 --> 00:10:17.513
- Drinking a little bit of
alcohol and we dip the rag.

145
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.220
stuff that into the bottle.

146
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.371
and we light the rag when it's time.

147
00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:29.490
Whoo. ooh.
(chuckles)

148
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.950
Oh. yeah.

149
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.050
Y'all ready?

150
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.832
It's going down. guys.

151
00:10:33.832 --> 00:10:35.130
Boom.

152
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.640
- We used to torch fellow gangsters.

153
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.900
that would come into our neighborhood

154
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.450
or anybody for that matter.

155
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.300
The neighborhood had a
lot of twists and turns.

156
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.150
And it was easy to get lost in there.

157
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.352
And all the people who did get lost

158
00:10:47.352 --> 00:10:49.830
used to throw Molotav cocktails at them.

159
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.590
We were bad kids.

160
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.140
We owned every square
inch of the neighborhood.

161
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.680
Not even the cops went
into White Fence territory.

162
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.897
Even though I used to get
tuned up by L.A.'s finest.

163
00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:01.770
"just doing their job."

164
00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:04.368
- Hey this is White Fence territory.

165
00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:05.201
Agarrarlo.

166
00:11:05.201 --> 00:11:08.160
- One day. Mike Mulhern
landed into the turf

167
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.560
and I beat him pretty good.

168
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.524
As we grew up hearing
the nickname Big Mike.

169
00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.636
He started getting a status.

170
00:11:14.636 --> 00:11:16.780
Later on it became my Eme comrade.

171
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.953
- You're not Roy. ese.

172
00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:20.647
You're Kilroy. dale!

173
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.820
- That's how you do it
homie. just like that.

174
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.500
- I never told nobody about what happened.

175
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.082
He never did either. it was business.

176
00:11:28.082 --> 00:11:29.010
- Orale?

177
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.903
- That's what's up homie. White Fence.

178
00:11:31.903 --> 00:11:35.070
(gentle upbeat music)

179
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.960
So you know this term
about being jumped in?

180
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.080
We didn't get jumped in. we
already were who wee were.

181
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.980
We fought every day and we enjoyed it.

182
00:11:48.053 --> 00:11:50.665
(grunting)

183
00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:51.498
- Get up!

184
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.040
- Fellow prisoners came and went.

185
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.603
just like life on the outside.

186
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.064
But the ones that matter. my brothers.

187
00:12:08.064 --> 00:12:09.423
EME members.

188
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.270
we shared a bond second to none.

189
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.090
to only God and man.

190
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.223
Together. we lived. loved and laughed.

191
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.773
With a union so strong.

192
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.763
it only took a handful of carnales.

193
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.942
to control the underworld of California.

194
00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:29.109
(bright upbeat music)

195
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.630
We were celebrating a gangster's release.

196
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.903
smoking weed. drinking.

197
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.040
toasting his homecoming.

198
00:12:39.914 --> 00:12:41.650
Of course it took a woman to get me.

199
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.474
to try heroin with her for the first time.

200
00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:46.833
- I want you to try this with me.

201
00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:50.483
- (chuckles) No.

202
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.670
I mean. that's not for me.

203
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.050
- Yes it is.

204
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.130
- I'm gonna play pro ball. so.

205
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.603
- Am I for you?

206
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.800
- Yes.

207
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.950
- Then this is for you.

208
00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:08.290
- (sighs) I mean...

209
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.333
- Just once.

210
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.193
- Okay.

211
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.773
- Relax. (chuckles)

212
00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:26.107
You dropped the goods.

213
00:13:26.107 --> 00:13:28.757
- I'm not too relaxed huh?
(chuckles)

214
00:13:31.828 --> 00:13:33.495
- Gonna tie you up.

215
00:13:41.817 --> 00:13:43.108
- Like that?

216
00:13:43.108 --> 00:13:43.941
- Tighter.

217
00:13:49.278 --> 00:13:52.396
- You ready?
- Just be gentle.

218
00:13:52.396 --> 00:13:53.229
- I will.

219
00:13:54.176 --> 00:13:56.696
♪ Don't let me go ♪

220
00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:58.568
♪ No. oh. oh. oh ♪

221
00:13:58.568 --> 00:14:01.366
♪ You got my key. you got my heart ♪

222
00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:05.696
♪ Don't let us ever be apart ♪

223
00:14:05.696 --> 00:14:08.130
♪ Now that you know. mmmh ♪♪

224
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.680
It became a lifelong addiction.

225
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.160
It didn't take long to become."A
hope to die a dope fiend."

226
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.253
I was smoking and injecting the
black gold any chance I got.

227
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.680
Got arrested a couple of
times under the influence

228
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.130
and got locked up at Preston.

229
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.810
Hoping that I was straightened out.

230
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.933
- Ladies. today's Kilroy's last game.

231
00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:35.925
He goes home on Tuesday.

232
00:14:35.925 --> 00:14:36.875
I'll miss you son.

233
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.050
- We're ready to play.

234
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:43.883
- Us too.

235
00:14:45.973 --> 00:14:47.540
- But you have three players.

236
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.223
- Yeah. we even brought an extra one.

237
00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:51.425
just in case your team has to pop up.

238
00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:52.823
- (chuckling) Yeah. right?

239
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.020
The dodgers were active in the community

240
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.720
because they were moving
from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.

241
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.900
And they were building the new stadium.

242
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.170
On my last day in custody.

243
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.223
I pitched a shut out against
one of the Dodger prospects.

244
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.520
That was the first time I
really knew how good I was.

245
00:15:12.368 --> 00:15:15.648
(wind blowing)

246
00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:18.565
(leaves crackling)

247
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.173
- Mr. Johnson.

248
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.063
- Ma'am.

249
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.940
As I told you on the phone.

250
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.370
the Los Angeles Dodgers wanna sign Ernest.

251
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.870
to a major league contract.

252
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.940
We're building a stadium
not far from here.

253
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.893
You'll be able to watch
him play every day.

254
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.530
- Mr. Johnson. I could
give you my permission.

255
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.240
but that won't matter.

256
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.623
He's back in jail.

257
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.910
Mira Senor.

258
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.510
You seem like a really nice man.

259
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.760
So I'm gonna be truthful with you

260
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.423
like I told the other scout.

261
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.363
I love him.

262
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.770
but he's been a problem
since he was a toddler.

263
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.560
And he's gonna get somebody hurt

264
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.223
or get himself killed.

265
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.103
You need to just move on.

266
00:16:05.789 --> 00:16:08.280
(sighs)

267
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.353
- It's such a shame.

268
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.523
Your grandson's arm was a gift from God.

269
00:16:20.694 --> 00:16:23.810
- I was sent back to Preston
where fate would intervene.

270
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.040
I was encourageable.

271
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.383
Pipped a guy in the head.

272
00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:31.440
I was told I was too
violent for that facility.

273
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.320
Knocking out lames was my claim to fame.

274
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.910
I was sent to The Chino
Guidance Center (CIM).

275
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.216
where I met with Huero Buff
Flores and Hondo Lechuga.

276
00:16:39.216 --> 00:16:40.049
- Kilroy. Hondo.

277
00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:44.373
- It was the start of my destiny.

278
00:16:44.373 --> 00:16:46.050
Huero Buff and Hondo
sought fellow inmates.

279
00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:51.050
who shared the same idea and
it began in DVI. in 1957.

280
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.560
Took a while to grow.

281
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.437
but in 1961. we had the
core group of carnales.

282
00:16:55.437 --> 00:16:58.420
And we was able to control
the inmate population.

283
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.080
By 1965. we was an unstoppable force.

284
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.273
We formed an elite gang of
highly violent individuals.

285
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.430
who commanded respect. answered to no one

286
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.123
and dealt with the consequences.

287
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:19.070
- Like I was saying that
only the hardcore gangsters.

288
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.140
best of the best are allowed to join.

289
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.053
We call it the Mexican Mafia.

290
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.783
- Man. you been reading
too many books ese.

291
00:17:26.783 --> 00:17:28.450
(chuckling)

292
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.963
- No. see. we've been around.

293
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:36.350
We've got the respect.
status. creature comforts.

294
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:40.603
time to take it to the next level.

295
00:17:42.556 --> 00:17:45.513
- DVI. we recruited the most
get-down gangsters out there.

296
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.743
There was no rules.

297
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.998
- Huero Buff. Hondo. Big D. Cheyenne

298
00:17:51.998 --> 00:17:55.331
they created an reglas. a blood oath.

299
00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:59.153
And the only way you could
get out was in a box.

300
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.690
This gang was called.

301
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.503
I am La EME the Mexican Mafia.

302
00:18:06.617 --> 00:18:08.806
Huero was a true visionary.

303
00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:10.863
A lot of people. they
didn't see the prophecy.

304
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.717
But he's unquestionably
the godfather of La EME.

305
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.707
- We need reglas carnal.

306
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.440
So people know what the consequences are

307
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.690
of messing with La EME.

308
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:30.270
- All right lets hear em...

309
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.783
- The rule number one.

310
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.553
EME comes before family.

311
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.923
Rule number two.

312
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.060
never acknowledge the existence of La EME.

313
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.383
- Number three.

314
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.943
Never raise no politics
against an EME carnal.

315
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.750
Four. every new member
needs to come sponsored

316
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.850
by an existing member.

317
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.643
- And number five.

318
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.890
a unanimous vote is
required for acceptance.

319
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.957
Six. death is the only way out.

320
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.073
Seven. never disrespect a fellow carnal.

321
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.313
Eight. never show fear or weakness.

322
00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.443
nine.

323
00:19:32.885 --> 00:19:37.367
A carnal must always. always
carry out a mission or a hit.

324
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.783
regardless of the odds or dangers.

325
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.887
And number 10. if you sponsor
a carnal that goes bad.

326
00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:52.473
it's your responsibility to take them out.

327
00:19:57.576 --> 00:20:01.140
EME reglas

328
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.140
- You've been my comarada for years now.

329
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.243
La EME wants you Kilroy.

330
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.790
but we're only gonna ask one time.

331
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.873
You in or what. ese?

332
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.953
- Tu Sabes.

333
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.500
You're going to Tracy.me San
Quentin.I'll take it with me.

334
00:20:24.876 --> 00:20:26.043
I'm in carnal.

335
00:20:29.527 --> 00:20:32.150
(foreign language)

336
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.400
- To reach this level
was a dream come true

337
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.740
for a violent soldier like me.

338
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.270
I already had the respect
of my neighborhood.

339
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.430
but this was a whole new level.

340
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.870
An elite group that only
accepts the best of the best.

341
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.978
True leaders. warriors. killers.

342
00:20:48.978 --> 00:20:49.811
(sirens wailing)

343
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:51.827
It was an honor to be an original member.

344
00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:58.152
(sirens wailing)
(upbeat music)

345
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.470
(gun clocks)

346
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.113
Nobody move. put your money out. now.

347
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.033
Now.

348
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.857
Come on. let's go.

349
00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:18.105
Don't move.

350
00:21:18.105 --> 00:21:20.865
I got a lot of respect for you.

351
00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:22.573
Don't do nothing you're gonna regret.

352
00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:25.298
The gun.

353
00:21:27.437 --> 00:21:28.833
Give me the badge.

354
00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:31.577
Give me the badge.

355
00:21:31.577 --> 00:21:32.744
Now. let's go.

356
00:21:34.777 --> 00:21:35.610
You good?

357
00:21:36.897 --> 00:21:37.814
Huh?
- Yeah.

358
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.000
- Don't go try nothing.
like. following us.

359
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.303
Not gonna end well.

360
00:22:01.582 --> 00:22:04.582
(brakes screeching)

361
00:22:05.904 --> 00:22:08.571
(horns blaring)

362
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.313
- Kilroy. long time.

363
00:22:18.376 --> 00:22:21.780
Orale. Detective Brando
(wood planks rattling)

364
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.217
Long time.

365
00:22:23.217 --> 00:22:25.077
- What brings you to the varrio?

366
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:27.099
(footsteps pattering)

367
00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:28.766
Hey. have a seat.

368
00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:34.748
Long time.
(seat rattling)

369
00:22:35.566 --> 00:22:36.983
- What I do now?

370
00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:40.501
Let me get right to it.

371
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:42.410
you took my friend's duty weapon.

372
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.260
He needs it back.

373
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.010
- I already pawned it.

374
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.510
- Well unpawn it.

375
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.830
The man. you disrespected
is a friend of mine.

376
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.520
And if he suffers any embarrassment

377
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.320
it will reflect in my investigation.

378
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.440
Right now. you both have
a chance to walk away

379
00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.740
with your heads held high.

380
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720
And it will all end.

381
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.913
We good?

382
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.700
- Yeah. we're good.

383
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.020
Don't want no trouble. just playing.

384
00:23:18.437 --> 00:23:21.040
(upbeat music)

385
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.270
Tell him I say hi. huh.

386
00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.137
- They probably have three
to 400 members in prison

387
00:23:28.137 --> 00:23:30.070
and you double that on the outside.

388
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.630
You have a long. violent. bloody history.

389
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.463
And the fact that

390
00:23:32.463 --> 00:23:34.340
people are starting to
turn up dead suddenly

391
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.330
could serve as a wake up
call of the Mexican Mafia.

392
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.010
or LA EME is no myth.

393
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.120
but instead a cold blooded reality.

394
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.290
born prison to survive.

395
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.580
they thrive on the streets of LA. to kill.

396
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.413
Now we warn you.

397
00:23:44.413 --> 00:23:46.920
there are some graphic scenes
you might find objectionable.

398
00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.740
- Everybody fears us.
all the prison gangs.

399
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.300
they control the inside.
all the criminal activity.

400
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.189
Anybody that shows weakness.
is executed without exception.

401
00:24:02.189 --> 00:24:04.310
(gate rattling)

402
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.300
- They are the gang of gangs.

403
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:11.300
Vicious. calculating. fearless. deadly.

404
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.500
They kill their enemies.

405
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.830
They kill their own if crossed.

406
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.140
To get in. you spill blood

407
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.130
and to leave the blood could be yours.

408
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.740
This is life in La EME.
or the Mexican Mafia.

409
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.823
(car engine roaring)

410
00:24:31.694 --> 00:24:32.773
- Take a little bit for ourselves.

411
00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:34.493
take care of the Familia. huh?.

412
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:39.393
- That's the thing. leaving
them behind it's not cool man.

413
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:42.580
- Yeah. I know it's not
cool. but we're already in.

414
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.393
It's La EME the family is inside.

415
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.105
I mean. that's the commitment. man

416
00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:51.600
That's what we said.

417
00:24:53.673 --> 00:24:56.040
- Kilroy. you sure you wanna do this?

418
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.993
We get caught. we get washed up homie.

419
00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:06.407
- The way I see it we get
caught. we're going home.

420
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:08.590
- Let's roll.

421
00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:11.898
(gun clocks)

422
00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:15.196
(gun firing)

423
00:25:16.555 --> 00:25:17.871
(handcuffs gritting)

424
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:20.288
(gun firing)

425
00:25:21.126 --> 00:25:23.317
(gun firing)

426
00:25:23.317 --> 00:25:26.400
(handcuffs gritting)

427
00:25:33.754 --> 00:25:36.171
(gun firing)

428
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.566
- Pastor Paul. can I help you?

429
00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:48.220
- Yeah. I was looking for my abuelita.

430
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.360
- Kilroy. it's me. Sal.

431
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.000
Your dad's old friend.

432
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.350
We've been praying for you.

433
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.490
I know you have been up to
no good in the neighborhood.

434
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.983
but let me show you something.

435
00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:08.333
(percussions beating)

436
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.893
See these hands. these hands
are made to worship the Lord.

437
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.863
Not to hurt anybody.

438
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.700
- Kilroy. God's got a plan for your life.

439
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.100
We're not promised tomorrow.

440
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.390
- I don't wanna hear a sermon fellas.

441
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.793
I just came to pick my abuelita.

442
00:26:30.117 --> 00:26:30.950
- I get it.

443
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:32.550
The Bible says in the book of Romans.

444
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.250
chapter three. verse 23.
that we're all sinners.

445
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.710
We've all fallen short
of the glory of God.

446
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.730
We broke his commandments.

447
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.140
we needed a savior.

448
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.750
Jesus came 2000 years
ago. died on the cross

449
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.230
and He rose again.

450
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.970
Resurrection power.

451
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.400
If you believe in Him with your heart.

452
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.860
you'll have eternal life with Him.

453
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.363
- Kilroy. Jesus loves you. man.

454
00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:57.480
You know those aren't the pastors words.

455
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.313
That scripture.

456
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.733
- I gotta go.

457
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:07.764
(tense upbeat music)

458
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.890
Life seems slow on the
inside. but in reality.

459
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.260
it goes as fast as it does on the outside.

460
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.340
Before we knew it. our youth
had been swallowed by time.

461
00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.070
It left us wondering
if it was all worth it.

462
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.550
We stayed busy attempting
to disguise our doubt

463
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.230
and not be perceived as weak.

464
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.260
Most of my days in prison

465
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.240
were filled of routine and laughter.

466
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.270
It seems strange I say laugher.

467
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.260
I could tell a joke with the best of them.

468
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.750
but it was with mi compadres.

469
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.930
Big D. Baby Bevito. Juan Green eyes

470
00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.560
Pretty Bob. Sporty Gill and Champ Reynoso.

471
00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.540
An inmate could almost
feel normal at the time.

472
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.720
The only thing missing was a cold beer.

473
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.720
women gasping in the next room

474
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.470
and kids playing in the yard.

475
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.740
For now. this was the only family I had.

476
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.140
It was a fun and dangerous
ride with my friends.

477
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.270
Some nicknames were
given to us as children.

478
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.440
Some are requested by the individual.

479
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.200
and some just fit.

480
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.510
For pretty Bob. a highly
respected brother.

481
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.410
there was really nothing else that fit.

482
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.410
No matter how we tried to
look. he was still pretty.

483
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.510
The girls swooned when
he looked their way.

484
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.540
like he was a Hollywood star.

485
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.380
Other apodos were simple. like.

486
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.650
Sleepy. Peanut Butter. Juan
Green eyes and Champ Reynoso.

487
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.383
It's common to even not know
the person's legal name.

488
00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:45.955
(upbeat hiphop music)

489
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.063
Coming in to a prison.

490
00:28:48.063 --> 00:28:50.720
there will always be a
speech from the sergeant.

491
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.620
It was usually about respect.

492
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.130
I mean. let's face it.
placing that many men together

493
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.070
without the expectation of respect.

494
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.837
would be a nightmare for everyone.

495
00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:01.628
For us and the officers
there was nothing personal.

496
00:29:01.628 --> 00:29:02.820
just business.

497
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.314
(shackles jingling)

498
00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:08.481
(footsteps pattering)

499
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.973
- My name is Sergeant Smith.

500
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.400
You have been assigned to my prison.

501
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.253
'cause you have been convicted of a crime.

502
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:37.500
It is my job. in this here
prison. to enforce the rules.

503
00:29:39.955 --> 00:29:40.788
And your job?

504
00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:42.883
To follow them.

505
00:29:44.468 --> 00:29:49.163
It is not my job. to display
my personal feelings.

506
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.090
in regards to the nature of your crime.

507
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.253
You will be treated with respect.

508
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:03.750
But I expect each one of
you to return that respect.

509
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.593
Good luck men.

510
00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.987
(upbeat hiphop music)

511
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.780
- We did everything we could to stay busy.

512
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.330
Most inmates were on the same
hamster wheel as the outside.

513
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.670
Go to work at the prison job
and returned to the cell tired.

514
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.930
Go to sleep and return
to work in the morning.

515
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.020
Mainline wasn't bad at all.

516
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.860
We could pretty much
do whatever we wanted.

517
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.110
Listen to music and sports
on the prison radio system.

518
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.270
play board games. read books.

519
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.980
Sometimes our program went fast
and sometimes it went slow.

520
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.477
But the most important game we played

521
00:30:48.477 --> 00:30:50.300
was the one in our own mind.

522
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.080
pushing through another tough life.

523
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.210
(exhaling loudly)

524
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:06.377
Come on. push.

525
00:31:07.947 --> 00:31:09.197
One more. yeah.

526
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.180
Looking good and working
out was and still is

527
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.683
and will always be important for La EME.

528
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.200
The high carb prison food.

529
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.033
could quickly

530
00:31:22.033 --> 00:31:24.828
turn a lean individual into a sloth.

531
00:31:24.828 --> 00:31:26.128
And that could man death.

532
00:31:29.214 --> 00:31:30.882
(weight lift bangs)

533
00:31:30.882 --> 00:31:35.882
- [Weightlifter] (yelling) Get off of me.

534
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.860
- They gave us weights to stay in shape

535
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.210
and release our aggression.

536
00:31:41.042 --> 00:31:41.875
(weight lift bangs)

537
00:31:41.875 --> 00:31:43.810
But they could also be weapons.

538
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.210
We took out one of our
brothers on the wieght bench.

539
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.534
with State owned tools.

540
00:31:47.534 --> 00:31:49.940
(gate clanking)

541
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.170
For a while. Charlie Manson.
his cell was next to mine.

542
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.662
He played the crazy part for the public

543
00:31:55.662 --> 00:31:57.453
but he wasn't like that with the inmates.

544
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.130
He used to sing with us all the time.

545
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.090
He used to sing Barry Manilow.

546
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.480
He used to sing Frank Sinatra

547
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.354
and he liked the Backstreet
Boys a little bit.(lol)

548
00:32:08.354 --> 00:32:11.410
(shank grinding)

549
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.173
Sometimes if you were still
at night you would hear.

550
00:32:14.173 --> 00:32:16.005
(shank grinding)

551
00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:18.713
a blade being sharpened on the concrete.

552
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.170
And you would say to yourself. who's next?

553
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.850
Sometimes it was me that
was sharpening the blade.

554
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.477
to maintain the fear
of everyone around me.

555
00:32:30.802 --> 00:32:32.463
- How many people have you killed?

556
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.593
- So. all you guys already
agreed to hit Richie?

557
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.330
Put your comment to the table.

558
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.233
What is it?

559
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.597
- He was one of our downest carnales.

560
00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:48.090
but he crossed the line.

561
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.117
It's time to send him home.

562
00:32:50.117 --> 00:32:53.368
(background chattering)

563
00:32:53.368 --> 00:32:55.599
- Where do you stand?

564
00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:59.690
- I don't know about the rest
of you. we have no choice.

565
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.640
Send him to Brazil.

566
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.107
- Where do you stand?

567
00:33:05.107 --> 00:33:08.027
- Like a brother. known
him for a lot of years.

568
00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:10.660
but this is strictly business.

569
00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.233
- Then. okay then.

570
00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:13.760
Then we'll get Spider on it

571
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.633
and we'll handle it clean.

572
00:33:20.464 --> 00:33:21.631
Orale?
- Orale.

573
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.563
(inmates chattering)

574
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.433
- I've been involved in a lot
of hits in and out of prison.

575
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.683
I put in a lot of work.

576
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.920
But it was better to
get off on them first.

577
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.633
before they came back and hurt us.

578
00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:42.567
I'm not proud of my past.
but I did what I did.

579
00:33:42.567 --> 00:33:45.600
And I don't think it's wise
for you to know the details.

580
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.063
There's no statute of
limitations on murder.

581
00:33:49.754 --> 00:33:53.260
(upbeat country music)

582
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.470
Another way we stayed busy was
during events back in prison

583
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.980
which was mostly reserved
for the honor blocks.

584
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.498
Inmates with clean time
and those who couldn't go.

585
00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:04.160
at least. listened on the
headphones in the cell.

586
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.285
It was popular for bands
to visit the prison.

587
00:34:06.285 --> 00:34:09.070
Most notably Johnny Cash.

588
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.710
Once in a while the circus made it's way

589
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.320
through the correction system.

590
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.260
even Billy Graham came through.

591
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.340
Little did I know these
seeds would grow in me.

592
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.490
but more on that later.

593
00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.810
We also had internal tournaments

594
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.810
such as handball. basketball. boxing.

595
00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.520
It was a reason to stay in shape

596
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.710
and an opportunity for me

597
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.800
to participate in the
sport I love. boxing.

598
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.930
Many of the brothers were trained boxers.

599
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:35.660
And a few of them would have
had a shot at the big time.

600
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.310
had they chosen a different path.

601
00:34:41.525 --> 00:34:45.906
(grunting)
(wood rattling)

602
00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:50.681
(feet shuffling)
(grunting)

603
00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:52.400
- Cheyenne?

604
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.603
I put a lot of work.

605
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.573
I earned my respect.

606
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.730
And I wanna be a carnal.

607
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.002
- It doesn't work that
way ese. you don't ask us.

608
00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:06.230
Talk to him. ese.

609
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.193
- You don't ask us. we ask you.

610
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.070
Be patient mijo. your time will come.

611
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.910
Joker couldn't wait for the EME call.

612
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.857
and quickly became a shot-caller
for the Nuestra Familia.

613
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.850
In a few short years.

614
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.490
he would be representing
our enemies from the North.

615
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.240
in getting a peace treaty
made with his idol. Cheyenne.

616
00:35:30.952 --> 00:35:34.267
(punching)
(feet shuffling)

617
00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:36.017
- You're too old for this Mandi.

618
00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:40.010
You've been in there
a minute. look at you.

619
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.510
already sweating. flapjacks.

620
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.864
(feet shuffling)

621
00:35:42.864 --> 00:35:43.705
- Get in here youngster.

622
00:35:43.705 --> 00:35:45.705
- A huevo. man. come on.

623
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.159
- Lemme teach you how it's done.

624
00:35:48.159 --> 00:35:48.992
- You ain't teaching nobody.

625
00:35:48.992 --> 00:35:51.742
so step back before you get hurt.

626
00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:56.241
- Get in here youngster. I'm
gonna teach you a lesson.

627
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:57.576
- All right then. let's do it.

628
00:35:57.576 --> 00:35:58.456
- All right Jokes.
- Ah. there you go. Joker.

629
00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:00.203
(laughing)
Come one. man.

630
00:36:00.203 --> 00:36:04.090
- Mandi invited him into
the ring and Joker accepted.

631
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.430
Mandi played with Joker.

632
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.270
Having fun slapping him around a little.

633
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.730
He didn't know how
angry Joker was getting.

634
00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.720
and notched up the trash talking.

635
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.630
By the end of the fight.

636
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.820
the huffing and puffing
Joker was also talking trash.

637
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.067
- Ready for this old man?
- Ready.

638
00:36:19.067 --> 00:36:21.327
(feet shuffling)

639
00:36:21.327 --> 00:36:25.827
(punching)
(grunting)

640
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.090
- Joker had earned the
respect of every member.

641
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:37.923
as he went toe to toe

642
00:36:37.923 --> 00:36:39.314
with a Mandi a professional Heavyweight.

643
00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:40.993
only he didn't see it that way.

644
00:36:40.993 --> 00:36:43.474
He believed he was disrespected by Mandi.

645
00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:45.929
he left the ring to
determined. to seek vengeance.

646
00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:47.762
- You still want some Mandi?

647
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.550
- I made a deal with a trustee

648
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.360
who worked in the sergeant's office.

649
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.590
He had access to information
on incoming prisoners.

650
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.510
He was successful in placing new inmates

651
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.210
in specific housing units.

652
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.610
He knew them by their names.

653
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.080
their gang affiliations and their crimes.

654
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.540
It cost me a spoon of
heroin. every shipment.

655
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.273
Federal bus is coming in tomorrow morning.

656
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:13.106
- Finally.

657
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.350
Look. there's a vato named
Gonzales on that bus.

658
00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.270
He's got a package for us.

659
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:23.073
I need you to get his cell near me.

660
00:37:23.073 --> 00:37:24.343
Or get me the package.

661
00:37:27.633 --> 00:37:30.050
(Si-mon)

662
00:37:37.501 --> 00:37:39.933
Captains calling a surprise
inspection on Thursday.

663
00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:41.850
The Goon Squad will be ready.

664
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.150
in case of any resistance.

665
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.210
- Who's on the bus?

666
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.050
- This morning's crew has
a load of no accounts.

667
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:50.900
except Joe Morgan.

668
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.303
Tomorrow. one of yours is
landing. Ritchie Mendez.

669
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.850
- Crazy Boy.

670
00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.683
- Si-mon.

671
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.840
- Make sure he gets on this tier.

672
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.520
- Orale.
- Gracias.

673
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.353
- Alrato.

674
00:38:10.249 --> 00:38:13.343
(door bangs)
(shackles jingling)

675
00:38:13.343 --> 00:38:15.650
- I was counting on the boredom
of correctional officers

676
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.330
to pull up my plan.

677
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.223
I mean. they was locked up
like us for 30 years. anyway.

678
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.563
Kilroy here.

679
00:38:23.857 --> 00:38:25.657
And I'm putting this tier on notice.

680
00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.443
Crazy Boy. kicked my pregnant daughter.

681
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.793
You may not think it's
personal. but it is.

682
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.253
Anybody got a problem?

683
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.573
Say it now.

684
00:38:50.034 --> 00:38:53.080
(door bangs)

685
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.500
In my era. we took care of the situation.

686
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.930
We wanted to hit somebody. we hit them.

687
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.097
Not some Sureno from the hood.

688
00:39:01.097 --> 00:39:02.767
I did my best to take him out.

689
00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:04.403
but he survived the encounter.

690
00:39:05.449 --> 00:39:08.013
And he was released from
prison shortly after.

691
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.830
Unfortunately for him.
(man grunting)

692
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.230
he was killed on the street.

693
00:39:22.633 --> 00:39:25.781
(bus engine roaring)

694
00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:28.781
(shackles jingling)

695
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.856
Joe Morgan was a progressive thinker.

696
00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:36.320
And was moving some of
the younger brothers

697
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.400
in the organization. forward.

698
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.530
He'd get them in EME.

699
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.521
in which all members assisted
each other to the greater end.

700
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:44.938
(door bangs)

701
00:39:48.561 --> 00:39:49.620
Why did you move me to your cell Joe?

702
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.120
- I had an open bunk.

703
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.026
Wanted to have a brother
fighting next to me.

704
00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:57.483
B.G.F. catch me without
my leg. and it's over.

705
00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:05.379
You know carnal. we could do damage.

706
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.303
if we stay together.

707
00:40:09.234 --> 00:40:13.200
Veteranos and youngsters.
one vision por La EME.

708
00:40:28.484 --> 00:40:29.420
- Orale.

709
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.503
- Orale.

710
00:40:43.485 --> 00:40:45.270
- One of the incidents
that elevated tension

711
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.700
between the North and the South.

712
00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.210
happened in September of 1968.

713
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.453
It's known as. "the Shoe War."

714
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.270
Most of the inmates were brewing pruno

715
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.013
awaiting Mexican independence day.

716
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.620
Carlitos took a pair of dress shoes

717
00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.730
from an unattended cell.

718
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.940
which belonged to Hector "Mad Dog" Padilla

719
00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.710
and Manuel "Menito" Romero.

720
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.210
both Northerners. they didn't fit.

721
00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.923
So Carlitos gave the
shoes to Robot as a gift.

722
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.160
Robot from Big Hazard.
was a get down brother.

723
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.540
afraid of nothing.

724
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.760
In fact. he antagonized other inmates.

725
00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.020
hoping for a confrontation.

726
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.320
Robot. walked the tier in the shoes.

727
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.313
twirling his pocket watch as
if he was in the neighborhood.

728
00:41:25.157 --> 00:41:26.770
Padilla who had been drinking pruno

729
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.260
confronted an unamused Robot.

730
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.343
and demanded the shoes be returned.

731
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:33.750
- Those are my shoes. ese.

732
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.530
- Yeah. that's right. they're mine now.

733
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.440
- You came in my cell and disrespected me?

734
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.480
- Yeah I did. what's up?

735
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.580
- Who do you think you are?

736
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.413
- I'm Robot.

737
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.800
- Robot refused and made
a gesture to bring it on.

738
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.820
- What's up?

739
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.390
- Padilla stated. he would
take care of it later.

740
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.700
Robot. not wanting to wait.

741
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.100
retrieved the shank and
bust into Padilla's cell.

742
00:41:54.077 --> 00:41:55.720
Menito was in the cell with Padilla

743
00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.650
and fought off Robot until
they were both stabbed.

744
00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:01.100
Both of them survived and
would later become members

745
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.250
of the Nuestra Familia.

746
00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.440
The incident ignited about 20 inmates

747
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.520
fighting a C-section cell block.

748
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.225
A Sureno got caught behind the locked gate

749
00:42:15.225 --> 00:42:17.240
with three NF members.

750
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.893
Cricket from Diamond St.
was killed by NF Babo Sosa.

751
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.270
The bloodshed would have been worse.

752
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.340
if it wasn't for the bravery
of a correctional officer.

753
00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.513
named Sergeant McCray.

754
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:27.950
Who somehow separated the inmates.

755
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:31.443
The hatred has lived on for 50 years.

756
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:37.013
- Brother. what is this anyways?

757
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:38.317
It doesn't look that good.

758
00:42:38.317 --> 00:42:40.864
- That's the same thing
you've been eating.

759
00:42:40.864 --> 00:42:42.432
- Ha. for the past couple of years?

760
00:42:42.432 --> 00:42:45.150
(laughing)

761
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.800
- Rodolfo "Cheyenne"
Cadena. was born in Texas.

762
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.120
But his family moved to
Bakersfield. California.

763
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.090
where he joined the Varrio Viejo Gang.

764
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.740
He committed his first
murder at 16 years old.

765
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.310
- Hey Joe. I gotta talk to Cheyenne.

766
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.300
with no one involved in our things.

767
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.010
Could you step off for a little bit?

768
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.710
Cheyenne was a highly
respected member. of La EME.

769
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.300
He was trying to establish a
peace treaty with our enemies

770
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.350
from Northern California.
the Nuestra Familia.

771
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.000
To form a super gang of Mexican inmates.

772
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.360
Most of us fellow Canales.

773
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.570
were against peace with any northerner.

774
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.440
But Cheyenne believed banding together

775
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.580
would give La Raza more power and control

776
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.780
than they could imagine.

777
00:43:24.742 --> 00:43:28.257
This peace treaty you're
trying. it's not gonna happen.

778
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.913
In fact. you're probably gonna get killed.

779
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.043
we don't want peace.

780
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.290
And you're probably gonna
get put on the list.

781
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.243
figure it out.

782
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.160
- Orale Kilroy. think about this.

783
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.630
A super gang of all Mexicans.

784
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.023
the best from all the pintas.

785
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.050
La EME could control California.

786
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.667
maybe Nevada. Texas.

787
00:43:50.667 --> 00:43:52.280
And who knows carnal?

788
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.333
Maybe the world.

789
00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.963
- You're your own man carnal. I disagree.

790
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.113
Well go and keep trucha Cheyenne.

791
00:44:05.758 --> 00:44:07.580
Though Cheyenne had earned so much respect

792
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.860
from his EME brothers.

793
00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.060
it wasn't enough to stop
the attacks against the NF.

794
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.590
Joker and his associates
decided to end the peace talks

795
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.373
by stabbing Cheyenne and
Palm hall in Chino prison.

796
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:21.050
He was stabbed 70 times
and thrown over the rail

797
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.000
three stories high.

798
00:44:24.845 --> 00:44:27.262
(door bangs)

799
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.820
There were constant battles
between sworn enemies.

800
00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.203
La EME was aligned with the Aryan brother.

801
00:44:37.203 --> 00:44:40.343
and the BGF was aligned
with Nuestra Familia.

802
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.760
- We have a full fledged war right now.

803
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.240
What I need you guys to do.

804
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.930
I need you to have eyes in the front

805
00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.660
and the back of your
heads at all time. 24/7.

806
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.320
No passes whatsoever.

807
00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.406
green light on everything on the yard.

808
00:44:53.406 --> 00:44:54.239
Do you understand?

809
00:44:54.239 --> 00:44:55.430
- So cut throat with it?

810
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.520
- You already know.

811
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.544
- They should fear for their action.

812
00:44:58.544 --> 00:44:59.377
- Let's do it man.

813
00:44:59.377 --> 00:45:02.650
- The latest attack was an
EME aggressor on a BGF member.

814
00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:06.060
The guard in the tower shot
Gabby from Florencia 13.

815
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.570
as he was about to finish
up on a BGF member.

816
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:10.020
Gabby refused the gunny

817
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.874
and hopped up the yard in handcuffs.

818
00:45:11.874 --> 00:45:13.474
(door bangs)

819
00:45:13.474 --> 00:45:16.807
(indistinct chattering)

820
00:45:25.797 --> 00:45:28.797
(shackles jingling)

821
00:45:35.177 --> 00:45:38.057
- Lemme give you guys a couple of minutes.

822
00:45:38.057 --> 00:45:42.000
- Yo. Kilroy. sorry about your
ese getting shot in the leg.

823
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.140
We don't need this thing to escalate.

824
00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.000
- It already has.

825
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.420
- What we wanna do right
now. is call a truce.

826
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.460
It was a gunman who shot him.

827
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.540
War on both sides will
be bad for both of us.

828
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.300
My boys would die and
your boys would die too.

829
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.810
- As far as I'm concerned.

830
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.973
there could be no peace between us.

831
00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:03.663
But I'll send the request
to the other carnales.

832
00:46:04.785 --> 00:46:06.035
And I'll get back to you.

833
00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:12.417
(shackles jingling)

834
00:46:12.417 --> 00:46:15.500
(tense upbeat music)

835
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.423
- Kilroy.

836
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.023
A.B. took a vote. we've got your back.

837
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.340
- Carnal. speaking to the BGF is a sin.

838
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.790
Why didn't you come to me
to discuss the situation?

839
00:46:58.952 --> 00:47:01.363
The carnales. they all look up to us.

840
00:47:02.548 --> 00:47:04.210
We need to be united.

841
00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.310
- I'm not against you. carnal.

842
00:47:08.244 --> 00:47:09.544
But I don't answer to you.

843
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.110
Though Joe and I didn't
really have a friendship.

844
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.630
Like a brother you don't
see eye to eye with.

845
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.053
We remained distant. but respectful.

846
00:47:20.909 --> 00:47:23.590
Orale?

847
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.620
Everything else gonna be all right.

848
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.713
I'ma talk to you later.

849
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.815
- What's up carnal?
- What's up..

850
00:47:29.815 --> 00:47:31.870
- Orale.

851
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.296
- Kilroy. we got word from the streets

852
00:47:34.296 --> 00:47:35.520
that a few carnales
are preaching the bible

853
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.930
in our neighborhoods.

854
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.270
They're making our gang look soft.

855
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.460
We gotta take 'em out.

856
00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:46.790
- If any of you are put in
more work than those vatos.

857
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:47.990
you get the green light.

858
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.863
Otherwise. show some
respect and leave it alone.

859
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.970
- At least I got one of
those Bible thumpers.

860
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.889
- It must be hard to hit a
carnal in their sleep. huh?

861
00:47:59.889 --> 00:48:01.383
(chuckles)
Sabes que?

862
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.130
Any of you wanna hit an older carnal.

863
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.740
Come to lock up.

864
00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.170
In my cell.

865
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.163
Today. or any day.

866
00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:12.183
We'll go life for life.

867
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.089
and I don't sleep.

868
00:48:15.089 --> 00:48:17.422
(chuckling)

869
00:48:27.617 --> 00:48:30.140
Nico. I told you about the brothers

870
00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.090
not liking one of ours reading the Bible.

871
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.270
- Kilroy. you gotta read this book.

872
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.023
It's got wars. fights.

873
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.893
love stories.

874
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.623
everything you can imagine.

875
00:48:50.187 --> 00:48:52.087
- You believe everything in that book?

876
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:54.623
- I do.

877
00:48:56.713 --> 00:48:57.933
I wanna preach. hermano.

878
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:03.053
I want everybody to know about Jesus.

879
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.083
- You can't serve two masters carnal.

880
00:49:10.268 --> 00:49:13.351
(tense upbeat music)

881
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.150
- Nico's reading the Bible a lot.

882
00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.393
And he's showing weakness in other areas.

883
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.040
It's time we clean house.

884
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.773
Kilroy talked to him and it didn't catch.

885
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:01.943
- Okay.

886
00:50:03.495 --> 00:50:05.445
Then we all agree. he needs to be gone.

887
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.770
He's Kilroy's amigo. tell
him to take care of it.

888
00:50:11.614 --> 00:50:13.781
- All right. I'll let him know.

889
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:22.320
- I received a kite
from Joe. to do the hit.

890
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.880
And I told him.

891
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.650
if you wanna do it. do it yourself.

892
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:31.203
And it created a chasm
between the new and the old.

893
00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:36.270
I handled my business
and I expected the same.

894
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.362
How are they gonna let the new generation

895
00:50:38.362 --> 00:50:40.193
tell the old generation what to do?

896
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.220
Started losing a lot of respect
and times were changing.

897
00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:50.220
(indistinct chatter)
(door bangs)

898
00:50:51.116 --> 00:50:54.199
(tense upbeat music)

899
00:51:31.028 --> 00:51:36.028
(shackles jingling)
(footsteps pattering)

900
00:51:36.337 --> 00:51:37.773
- Cell's just opened up.

901
00:51:44.844 --> 00:51:49.844
(shackles jingling)
(footsteps pattering)

902
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.553
Lock it.

903
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.360
- Sleepy Huerta. took him out.

904
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:21.680
Started calling himself. the professional.

905
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.193
due to the surgical strike.

906
00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.530
Even though spoke to Nico.

907
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.980
I sometimes I think I
could have stopped the hit.

908
00:52:31.953 --> 00:52:33.233
I feel bad that didn't.

909
00:52:37.407 --> 00:52:40.640
As far as I'm concerned Nico
was a martyr for the Lord.

910
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.930
Sleepy and I had an argument

911
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.840
about the way the hit was carried out.

912
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.430
He took offense to my words
and later attacked me.

913
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.663
That was a mistake.

914
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.070
Apparently there was a
new way to handle things.

915
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.490
I was doing burpees.

916
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.070
Peanut Butter was in front of me.

917
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.790
A split second before the
attack. Sleepy yelled my name.

918
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:59.660
- Hey. Kilroy!

919
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.860
- He was behind me.

920
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.626
I was able to limit the blade
from going deep into my chest.

921
00:53:03.626 --> 00:53:04.814
(grunting)
(punching)

922
00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.890
And punched Sleepy silly.
running sets on him.

923
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:08.920
I let him loose when I saw
the gunner on the tower

924
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.365
ready to shoot me.

925
00:53:10.365 --> 00:53:15.365
- Get down!

926
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.213
- How's he doing?

927
00:53:26.213 --> 00:53:28.040
- He's good. lucky guy.

928
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:32.051
Half an inch more. he would
be stabbed in the heart.

929
00:53:32.051 --> 00:53:32.990
- What kind of meds is he on?

930
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.190
- Just some antibiotics.

931
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.823
- Can I have a word with him?
- Sure.

932
00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.260
- What happened out there at Kilroy?

933
00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:48.020
- I fell.

934
00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.320
- You fell?

935
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.920
You gonna stick with that story?

936
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.760
- Like I said. sarge. I fell.

937
00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.893
- You fell. all right.

938
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.120
- As a brother who was down for La Causa.

939
00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.140
I never thought I would be a target.

940
00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.870
I was quickly back in good graces.

941
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.080
never fully finding out what happened?

942
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.230
That's how it was.

943
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:12.300
One day you're good.

944
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.760
The next day you get hit.

945
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.074
Prison transfers made it
impossible to get my revenge.

946
00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:19.220
- (chuckling) Orale. Kilroy.

947
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.370
see why I want you in my cell?.

948
00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:24.700
I heard you pulled the
shank out of your chest.

949
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.100
and then knocked Sleepy out.

950
00:54:33.079 --> 00:54:35.162
- You called the hit Joe?

951
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.793
- Nah. I ain't got no
beef with you carnal.

952
00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.067
It's personal. between you.
Sleepy and Peanut Butter.

953
00:54:48.794 --> 00:54:50.400
- Orale.

954
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.570
Like any generational organization.

955
00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.660
there's always conflict
between different ideas

956
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.330
and methods of operation.
creating underlying tension.

957
00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:00.370
The cell arrangement
between me and Joe Morgan

958
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:02.250
lasted only a couple of weeks.

959
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.440
Long enough to understand

960
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.190
there was a generation gap growing.

961
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.793
Big D was an impressive brother.

962
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.223
He was big and strong
and he was a good boxer.

963
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:16.340
And he was a get down
soldier for the La Causa.

964
00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.200
When he discovered Christ.

965
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.160
rather than abandoning us.

966
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.853
he kept writing us. plus
he would come visit.

967
00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.360
- [Big D] My dearest carnal.

968
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:31.900
I hope that you're well and stay strong.

969
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.977
I am writing you this letter to tell you

970
00:55:33.977 --> 00:55:35.650
and the rest of the world.

971
00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:38.410
I am no longer in a place of darkness.

972
00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:42.120
I have given my life to our
Lord and savior Jesus Christ.

973
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.883
- [Joe] I finally found the
freedom I've been searching for.

974
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.440
I want you to know. whatever we did

975
00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.390
- [Kilroy] or didn't do.

976
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.810
stays with me.

977
00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:56.163
Only Jesus can judge us
and He chooses to forgive.

978
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.670
- [Joe] I'll be praying
for you to see the light.

979
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.207
Until then. stay safe my brother.

980
00:56:29.637 --> 00:56:31.220
- Hello Mr. Roybal.

981
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:33.373
Full disclosure.

982
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.650
I am a former Bell Gardens police officer.

983
00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.600
- Police officer?

984
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.830
- Yes.

985
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.900
I left the department to
practice law full time.

986
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.900
- You need to practice on somebody else.

987
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.733
- This is what I'm gonna
do for you Mr. Roybal.

988
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:53.555
I'm gonna file a brief
with writs and appeals

989
00:56:53.555 --> 00:56:55.255
and we'll hope for the best. okay?

990
00:56:56.777 --> 00:56:59.110
(chuckling)

991
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:07.867
- With all the hits going
on. lots of stories came out

992
00:57:07.867 --> 00:57:09.920
and some of them became legend.

993
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.130
Little Mo Farrell.

994
00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.550
was shanked during an
EME internal cleansing.

995
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:14.890
Upon taking him to hospital.

996
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:17.787
he told an A.B. patient.
"if I can't be EME.

997
00:57:17.787 --> 00:57:19.120
"I would rather die."

998
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.263
And pulled his I.V and
died within a few minutes.

999
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.740
- All the destruction.

1000
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.877
all the hatred.

1001
00:57:30.531 --> 00:57:34.448
did anything good come
from 40 years in prison?

1002
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:38.390
- Well. maybe one thing.

1003
00:57:40.174 --> 00:57:41.007
- And what's that?

1004
00:57:41.982 --> 00:57:43.960
- In late eighties. early nineties.

1005
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.820
gangsters were killing
each other by the thousands

1006
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.653
every year.

1007
00:57:47.541 --> 00:57:50.257
It was a new thing. called
"the drive-by shooting."

1008
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.053
Became very popular.

1009
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:56.100
Hundreds every weekend

1010
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.100
throughout the south-west United States.

1011
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:01.733
It was a way of killing.
without any real danger.

1012
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.290
- So what's this I hear?

1013
00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.900
- He just drove up and blasted the house.

1014
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.830
four year old girl was killed.

1015
00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.080
another one's in the hospital.

1016
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.510
Lots of Surenos are getting
killed in drive-by shootings

1017
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:21.360
this last decade.

1018
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.720
Foot soldiers just gone.

1019
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.420
Back in the days it was different.

1020
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.370
We walked up and looked
the enemy in the face

1021
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:31.563
before we hit them.

1022
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.570
- Those days are gone carnal?

1023
00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:36.403
- Maybe not?.

1024
00:58:37.318 --> 00:58:38.800
We've got some homeboys right now

1025
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.937
organizing to stop drive-bys.

1026
00:58:40.937 --> 00:58:43.593
Not only was the Mexican
Mafia losing soldiers.

1027
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.000
but they felt it was a
less than honorable way

1028
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.233
to carry out a hit.

1029
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:52.970
Not even to mention the women and children

1030
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:55.286
getting caught in the crossfire.

1031
00:58:55.286 --> 00:58:57.237
- What happened?

1032
00:58:57.237 --> 00:59:00.900
- Our organization felt it
was bad business in every way

1033
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.547
for soldiers to be killing each other.

1034
00:59:02.547 --> 00:59:06.290
And if they did. before that happened.

1035
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.160
they had to get the blessing from the EME.

1036
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.010
- So how do we hold them accountable?

1037
00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:13.793
- Remember. the pintas our home.

1038
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:16.400
- Streets is our backyard.

1039
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.170
- Who's leading the charge on the outside?

1040
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.170
- There's lots of brothers involved

1041
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:21.800
on the business end of the idea.

1042
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:26.580
But taking the lead is Peter
Ojeda "Sana" from Orange County

1043
00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.533
and Chuco Castro from Los Angeles.

1044
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:32.670
It'll benefit us in building the taxes

1045
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.620
and making a more formidable structure.

1046
00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.194
- Sounds good. carnal.

1047
00:59:37.194 --> 00:59:38.027
- Si-mon.

1048
00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:39.943
- Si?.

1049
00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:41.860
- Sana from Orange County.

1050
00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.840
he started meetings with the
neighborhood shot-callers

1051
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.710
from West Side La Habra to Capistrano.

1052
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:47.473
at El Salvador Park in Santa Ana.

1053
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.380
A couple months later.

1054
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.870
Chuco Castro. started the
juntas at Elysian Park.

1055
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:53.933
in Los Angeles.

1056
00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.373
This is the beginning of
the rules of engagement.

1057
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.200
- Rules for killing?

1058
01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.140
- You know any authorized drive-by?

1059
01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.490
Shooter gets a green light.

1060
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:14.260
Any gang member who encounters
that vato.has to hit him.

1061
01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.150
or he gets a green light.

1062
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:17.933
It was simple but effective.

1063
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.693
And just like that the drive-by stopped.

1064
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.090
Now. critics are gonna say

1065
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.800
that we wanted a bigger. better
business to collect taxes

1066
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.913
but regardless. we saved
tens of thousands of lives.

1067
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.863
So I guess we did do something right.

1068
01:00:38.993 --> 01:00:40.093
But the devil's a liar.

1069
01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.913
Proverbs 16. 17. 18. and 19.

1070
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.450
Let you know where God's at with that.

1071
01:00:50.974 --> 01:00:52.742
(coffee slurped)

1072
01:00:52.742 --> 01:00:54.492
You want some coffee?

1073
01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.213
- Good news.

1074
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.490
The Appeal Court reduced
the murder conviction

1075
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.920
to manslaughter.

1076
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.063
And your attempted murder was dismissed.

1077
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:11.440
It's gonna take a few months to process.

1078
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.033
but hey. you're gonna be a free man.

1079
01:01:18.803 --> 01:01:19.653
What do you know?

1080
01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:23.563
A police officer helping me.

1081
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.893
My prized possession.

1082
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.420
It's the only thing I own.

1083
01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.550
- It's beautiful.

1084
01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:39.730
- Oh. yeah.

1085
01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.023
- Everyone in the neighborhood
is jealous. it's funny.

1086
01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:44.243
- Is that right?

1087
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.410
I want you to have it.

1088
01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.710
- You're serious?

1089
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:03.173
- It's yours.
(keys jingling)

1090
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:09.783
- Start it up.

1091
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.621
- You're serious?

1092
01:02:16.621 --> 01:02:18.430
- (chuckling) I'm seriously
gonna take it back

1093
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:20.304
if you don't start it up.

1094
01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.554
(laughing)

1095
01:02:24.655 --> 01:02:27.072
(door bangs)

1096
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:32.158
(keys jingling)

1097
01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.907
(car engine running)

1098
01:02:38.907 --> 01:02:42.074
(clapping) Eso!

1099
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.151
- Come on in.

1100
01:02:47.151 --> 01:02:48.320
- You wanna take me for a ride?

1101
01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.423
- Let's do it.
(laughing loudly)

1102
01:02:52.327 --> 01:02:53.913
- You're gonna chauffeur me around?

1103
01:02:55.116 --> 01:03:00.116
(door bangs)
(car engine revs)

1104
01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:07.540
(shackles jingling)
(footsteps pattering)

1105
01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:10.413
- Kilroy. you got 10 minutes.

1106
01:03:14.967 --> 01:03:15.800
- Hey.

1107
01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.730
my appeal came through.

1108
01:03:23.276 --> 01:03:24.109
I'm going home.

1109
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.790
- I spent all this time
moving up the ranks

1110
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.400
and now you're leaving me?

1111
01:03:39.011 --> 01:03:43.011
- A lot of heads to
role. scores to settle.

1112
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.393
You hold it down here.

1113
01:03:47.845 --> 01:03:50.543
- (sighs) It's funny.

1114
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.483
How I always wanted to be like you.

1115
01:03:56.237 --> 01:03:58.057
And now I guess I am.

1116
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.059
- You take care of yourself. David.

1117
01:04:07.059 --> 01:04:10.226
(somber upbeat music)

1118
01:04:32.359 --> 01:04:35.026
(door rattling)

1119
01:04:36.764 --> 01:04:38.991
Take care of yourself.

1120
01:04:38.991 --> 01:04:41.824
(deep exhalation)

1121
01:04:50.607 --> 01:04:54.280
When I beat the case
and you was in my cell.

1122
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.057
that was the time to beg for forgiveness

1123
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:01.900
and tell you I was sorry.

1124
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.183
for not being the father
I should have been.

1125
01:05:11.231 --> 01:05:13.981
But I turned into EME business.

1126
01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.460
This was our life.

1127
01:05:26.793 --> 01:05:29.523
I should have told you
how much I loved you.

1128
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:38.320
I mean.

1129
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.233
everything went so left.

1130
01:05:43.514 --> 01:05:45.764
I always thought about you.

1131
01:05:48.714 --> 01:05:49.974
(sighs)

1132
01:05:49.974 --> 01:05:51.807
But this was our life.

1133
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:01.730
- Orale carnales.

1134
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:05.902
what to do with the brothers
who found God on the outside?

1135
01:06:05.902 --> 01:06:09.727
- Well. every carnal is free
to do what he thinks is right.

1136
01:06:12.758 --> 01:06:14.008
La EME. has a death oath.

1137
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.517
there no longer part of it.

1138
01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:19.483
So if you decide to take them out.

1139
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.083
we don't have a problem with it.

1140
01:06:25.224 --> 01:06:28.460
But let's not forget. these
vatos never debriefed.

1141
01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:31.232
they're not ratas.

1142
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:37.130
They all put in work to help
make La EME. what it is today.

1143
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:38.840
- So they get a free pass?

1144
01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.740
- I'm just saying.

1145
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:44.190
I mean. these were some crazy
vatos that made us prowd

1146
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.143
back in the day.

1147
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.853
So my advice is this.

1148
01:06:50.217 --> 01:06:51.873
As long as they stay in real.

1149
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.363
they don't cooperate with law enforcement.

1150
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:58.603
Leave it alone.

1151
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.343
We have more important things to do.

1152
01:07:02.343 --> 01:07:04.333
- Orale. I'll pass it on.

1153
01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:07.520
- There was a few of us EME members

1154
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.913
who became Christians.

1155
01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.010
And I'm proud to say we never debriefed.

1156
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:16.213
meaning. we can never be called rats.

1157
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:23.090
I don't think I ever told
you how I became a Christian.

1158
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:24.880
I was using dope again.

1159
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.603
no surprise for a lifelong addict.

1160
01:07:27.467 --> 01:07:28.300
I wasn't paying rent

1161
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.240
and I heard a car drive up.

1162
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.720
Knowing they were collecting rent.

1163
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.987
I was ready to break and run or hide.

1164
01:07:33.987 --> 01:07:35.340
And then I thought.

1165
01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.800
I never ran from anything in my life.

1166
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.600
Why am I gonna run from an old lady?

1167
01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.990
I saw my wife's aunt jump out of the car

1168
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.020
and shuffle up to me.

1169
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.130
She was lit up like a Christmas tree.

1170
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:48.040
At that point. I was
thinking about hustling her

1171
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.410
for some kind of drugs.

1172
01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.770
She had to be on some kind of medication.

1173
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:53.963
Instead what she did changed my life.

1174
01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:57.420
She asked if I would like to
accept the Lord Jesus Christ.

1175
01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.150
as my personal savior.

1176
01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:01.810
And I said. "I'm not ready."

1177
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:03.570
Then I heard a little voice.

1178
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.730
you've been saying that for 40 years.

1179
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.280
another 40 years and you'll
be a hundred years old.

1180
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:17.683
- Jesus. I give you my life.

1181
01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.280
- Jesus. I give you my life.

1182
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.193
- I ask you to come into my heart.

1183
01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.093
- I ask you to come into my heart.

1184
01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.357
- I believe that You
died on the cross for me.

1185
01:08:38.357 --> 01:08:39.403
for my sins.

1186
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.200
- I believe that You
died on the cross for me.

1187
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.050
for my sins.

1188
01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:48.903
- Fill me with Your Holy Spirit.

1189
01:08:48.903 --> 01:08:51.320
- Fill me with Your Holy Spirit.

1190
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.320
- I ask You to cut the burdens

1191
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:58.743
and take the wheel.

1192
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:02.670
- I ask You to cut the burdens

1193
01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:04.013
and take the wheel.

1194
01:09:05.437 --> 01:09:08.102
- In Jesus Name.

1195
01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.035
- In Jesus Name.

1196
01:09:10.035 --> 01:09:11.452
- Amen.

1197
01:09:11.452 --> 01:09:12.285
- Amen.

1198
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:16.720
I was still thinking about
getting the drugs she was on.

1199
01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.350
Only I didn't know she wasn't high.

1200
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:22.050
She had an overdose of the Holy Ghost.

1201
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:24.690
We spoke the sinner's prayer together.

1202
01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:26.670
but I told her it didn't take.

1203
01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:28.664
She said. what do you mean?

1204
01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.760
I said. when people accept Jesus.

1205
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.540
they shout and jump for
joy and sing Hallelujah.

1206
01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:35.913
I don't feel anything.

1207
01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:02.900
I took a step forward.

1208
01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.500
something was wrong.

1209
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.940
I took another step.

1210
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.640
It felt like I was walking on air.

1211
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.130
I've been serving the
Lord ever since that day.

1212
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.450
The Lord has never left my side.

1213
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:16.210
through joy and sorrow.

1214
01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:19.750
I was in a big rig crash
that nearly ended my life.

1215
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.273
I lost my son to the
system for many years.

1216
01:10:22.273 --> 01:10:24.440
When he was finally released from prison.

1217
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.824
he came to know God's love.

1218
01:10:26.824 --> 01:10:29.120
I had become distant
from my other children.

1219
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.223
God's grace gave me another chance.

1220
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:34.360
God led me to start an
outreach ministry called.

1221
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.170
Homiez 4 Christ.

1222
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.840
I spend the time I have left.

1223
01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.730
preaching about God's grace
to gangsters and the homeless.

1224
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:44.910
I even preach to African
villages and prisons.

1225
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:45.993
If he changed me.

1226
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.180
he can change anybody.

1227
01:10:50.201 --> 01:10:53.241
I would visit the prisons
where I once was an inmate.

1228
01:10:53.241 --> 01:10:54.441
and I shared the gospel.

1229
01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.766
And I was between two gates

1230
01:10:56.766 --> 01:10:59.607
when the spotlight momentary blinded me.

1231
01:10:59.607 --> 01:11:03.236
It was the prison warden who
despised me. many years ago.

1232
01:11:03.236 --> 01:11:06.640
(footsteps pattering)

1233
01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.473
- Kilroy.

1234
01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:10.993
- Whose there?

1235
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:13.130
- It's warden Johnson.

1236
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.503
You remember me?

1237
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.217
You know. there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

1238
01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.810
I wanna know why you put
the green light out on me?

1239
01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:32.490
- Warden Johnson. I don't remember that.

1240
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:36.073
- Now we intercepted the
kite out of Pelican Bay.

1241
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:39.540
It says you co-signed the hit.

1242
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.063
I had to relocate my whole
family because of this.

1243
01:11:45.818 --> 01:11:46.918
I don't remember that.

1244
01:11:48.699 --> 01:11:50.713
I got an accident and lost my memory.

1245
01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:54.410
But I've come a long way.

1246
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.750
I'm a Christian now.

1247
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:56.943
- Now. now.

1248
01:11:56.943 --> 01:11:59.430
I know you're a changed man.

1249
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:02.980
and that's the only reason why
I let you back in my prison.

1250
01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.876
- You a Christian?

1251
01:12:04.876 --> 01:12:06.960
- Am I a Christian?

1252
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.513
No. I'm a Catholic.

1253
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.780
- Do you have a personal
relationship with Jesus?

1254
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.640
The Bible says in Romans.

1255
01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.760
that. "If you confess with your mouth.

1256
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.910
the Lord Jesus. and believe in your heart

1257
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:29.770
that God raised Him from the dead.

1258
01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.163
You will be saved.

1259
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:36.943
Do you believe in your
heart through faith.

1260
01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.283
that Jesus is God. died
on the cross for our sins.

1261
01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.503
raised on the third day?

1262
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:48.230
He filled your heart with the Holy Spirit?

1263
01:12:51.182 --> 01:12:54.820
- You know. I've thought about
this conversation. a lot.

1264
01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.743
And how it'd go between you and I.

1265
01:12:57.817 --> 01:12:59.278
And not in a million years

1266
01:12:59.278 --> 01:13:01.943
did I think it would go in this direction.

1267
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.600
But to answer your question.

1268
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:08.143
yes. I do.

1269
01:13:11.618 --> 01:13:12.918
- Then you're a Christian.

1270
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.557
Warden Johnson. can I pray for you?

1271
01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:21.670
- Yes. you can.

1272
01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:22.503
- Amen.

1273
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.178
Father God. thank you for today.

1274
01:13:26.178 --> 01:13:28.227
Thank you for blessing
me Father with strength.

1275
01:13:28.227 --> 01:13:32.143
and thank you for bringing
another true soldier home Father.

1276
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:36.780
I pray for warden Johnson
for any wrongdoings

1277
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.410
I might've caused. Father.

1278
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:42.359
Thank you. Father for
letting us be here today.

1279
01:13:42.359 --> 01:13:44.363
In Jesus Name. Amen.

1280
01:13:48.252 --> 01:13:49.370
- Amen.

1281
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:50.740
- Thank you.

1282
01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.150
Under a prison spotlight.

1283
01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:53.383
I prayed for the warden.

1284
01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.818
The Lord does indeed
work in mysterious ways.

1285
01:13:57.818 --> 01:14:00.901
(tense upbeat music)

1286
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:17.330
- I went to a seminar.

1287
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:20.263
They wanted to know how I changed my life.

1288
01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:23.943
Because there was there
was counselors there.

1289
01:14:23.943 --> 01:14:26.173
there was psychiatrists there.

1290
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:32.003
With all those titles. PhD. BA.

1291
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:34.110
and there were all there.

1292
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:37.070
And they wanted to know
how I changed my life.

1293
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:38.683
And I just told them the truth.

1294
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.700
And I gave them a short testimony

1295
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:42.964
of what the Lord had done in my life.

1296
01:14:42.964 --> 01:14:46.337
I said. I accepted Him in my life.

1297
01:14:46.337 --> 01:14:49.330
And I told them. I also had a B.A.

1298
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:50.630
They said. "How could you?

1299
01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:54.930
"You said you only went
to the eighth grade."

1300
01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:57.213
And I told them. I'm born again Christian.

1301
01:14:58.109 --> 01:14:59.393
And I had a PhD.

1302
01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:01.870
They couldn't figure it out.

1303
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:04.020

praying heaven down."
