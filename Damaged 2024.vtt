<i> Robbery gone wrong?</i>

37
00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:27.495
- This looks like
someone's sending a message

38
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:30.501
through a snitch

39
00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:32.475
that should have known better.

40
00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:34.675
- How can you be sure?

41
00:03:35.706 --> 00:03:38.344
- Tattoo. the name of a gang.

42
00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.544
and I guarantee you. detective.

43
00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.216
had you looked closer.

44
00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:47.716
you would see his
tongue's been cut out.

45
00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:50.328
This is just some gang bullshit.

46
00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.858
Let them kill each other.

47
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.992
Make the streets safer.

48
00:03:57.033 --> 00:03:58.497
- Hold on. Lawson.

49
00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:00.035
- [Dan] You know
where to find me.

50
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.933
- Yeah. Propping up a bar.

51
00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:04.276
Why don't you just quit?

52
00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:06.839
- Drinking?

53
00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:09.377
- It's been six
years since the last-

54
00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:11.074
- You don't-
- All right. All right.

55
00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:13.384
You can't catch 'em all.

56
00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:18.356
Your partner. Walker.
he knew when to quit.

57
00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:20.487
- Yeah.

58
00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:24.219
Well. some of us
can't just walk away.

59
00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:31.167
Piece of shit.
(tense music)

<i> Sarah.</i>

(thudding on window)

67
00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.343
- Oh!
- Open up. I'm getting soaked.

68
00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.287
- Come on.

69
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:51.347
- Ah. Christ!

70
00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:53.353
- The fuck you want?

71
00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:54.887
- You're gonna wanna see this.

72
00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:00.156
(ominous music)

73
00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:04.599
(voice whispering)

74
00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:07.130
Kills five seemingly
random people in Chicago.

75
00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.672
then lays low for six years.
- [Dan]<i> Mm.</i>

76
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.181
- You think it's a copycat?

77
00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:21.383
- We never published any images

78
00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:23.920
of how the body
parts were laid out.

79
00:05:23.955 --> 00:05:25.621
I want in on this.

80
00:05:26.684 --> 00:05:29.125
- Good.
(phone ringing)

81
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.986
Scottish police want a word.

82
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:33.425
That body was
found in Edinburgh.

83
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:34.964
(ominous music continues)

84
00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:37.501
- Yeah. Hello. this
is Detective Lawson.

85
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.609
(ominous music continues)

86
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.516
- What time did you get
to sleep last night?

87
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:56.718
(dog barking)

88
00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:00.018
Glen.

89
00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:03.494
Breakfast.
- Thanks.

90
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.024
Hey. are you okay?

91
00:06:07.564 --> 00:06:11.101
- Are you going to
make it this afternoon?

92
00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.196
- Yeah. I haven't forgotten.

93
00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.100
There's a detective flying
in from Chicago today.

94
00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:20.935
He's gonna be
consulting on my case.

95
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.238
- [Marie]<i> I need you today.</i>

96
00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:27.309
(somber music)

97
00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:37.022
- Gotta go.

98
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.633
- Detective Lawson.
Hi. I'm Superintendent Kessler.

99
00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.976
This is DCI Glen Boyd.
- D...

100
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:52.906
- Detective Chief Inspector.

101
00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:55.680
- When can I see
the crime scene?

102
00:06:56.517 --> 00:07:00.313
- We've never encountered
such a violent case as this.

103
00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:04.748
Dismembering of the victim's
arms and legs and decapitation.

104
00:07:05.117 --> 00:07:07.519
We read the case file
your department sent.

105
00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:08.922
We appreciate you sharing.

106
00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:13.264
- Abigail Myres. age 35.

107
00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:18.470
Last seen leaving West
Edinburgh Synagogue at 6:00 PM.

108
00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:26.907
Satanic cross.
- Satanic Temple icon.

109
00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:30.778
- Your report stated

110
00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:33.045
that you leaned towards
three symbols of worship.

111
00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:37.850
The the Satanic Temple
icon. the agnostic cross.

112
00:07:37.885 --> 00:07:39.453
and the serpent symbol
of the antichrist.

113
00:07:39.488 --> 00:07:41.493
- That all became inconclusive.

114
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.463
Different profilers
have tried to see

115
00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.594
if there's any evident
connection to any sects.

116
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.569
But general consensus is

117
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.937
this is not textbook
cult ideology.

118
00:07:57.603 --> 00:07:59.242
Any suspects?

119
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.243
- We've taken statements
from the neighbors.

120
00:08:01.278 --> 00:08:02.604
checking their alibis.

121
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.875
Only one neighbor so far
is a person of interest.

122
00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:08.954
Lives across the road
from Abigail at number 62.

123
00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:10.919
a Mr. Avery Thompson.

124
00:08:10.954 --> 00:08:14.350
Reports of an argument. but
we haven't verified it yet.

125
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.529
- She live alone?

126
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.026
- I believe so.

127
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.910
- Good looking family there.

128
00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.645
Must be proud.

129
00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.246
What's his or her name?

130
00:08:39.282 --> 00:08:40.849
- It's Callum.

131
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:46.116
It's his birthday today.
- Oh.

132
00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:49.358
- He would've been three.
(melancholy music)

133
00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:52.157
We lost him just
over a year ago.

134
00:08:55.364 --> 00:08:56.733
- Oh. I'm sorry.

135
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.701
- Minimal blood
splatter on the walls.

136
00:09:02.737 --> 00:09:04.967
Pool of blood on
the floorboards.

137
00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:08.005
An outline of a cross in blood

138
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.747
where the arms and
legs were arranged.

139
00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:14.382
Chair knocked over.
lamp knocked over.

140
00:09:14.818 --> 00:09:17.116
Contents of purse
emptied out on the floor.

141
00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:20.391
- So he arrived after she
got home from the synagogue.

142
00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.561
which means he
probably followed her.

143
00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:24.695
- Well. he knew her routine.

144
00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:26.728
We haven't ruled out it

145
00:09:26.764 --> 00:09:28.996
being a religiously-motivated
hate crime yet.

146
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.429
- Find anything unusual?

147
00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:34.430
- Yes.
One foreign object.

148
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.539
A key.

149
00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:39.502
It fits none of
the locks in here.

150
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.679
- You sent this to forensics?

151
00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:42.581
- Yeah.

152
00:09:49.516 --> 00:09:50.622
What is it?

153
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.451
- It's not the same.

154
00:09:54.053 --> 00:09:57.893
My killer was
methodical. meticulous.

155
00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.524
Let's wait and see if
the torso turns up.

156
00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:09.740
- You know. the only reason
a serial killer stops

157
00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:13.003
is either he's dead or...

158
00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:15.104
- Doing the time
for another crime.

159
00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:19.379
Yeah. I know.
And yes. we checked.

160
00:10:19.415 --> 00:10:21.844
(phone ringing)

161
00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:24.447
- Sorry.
Sorry.

162
00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:26.753
I didn't forget.

163
00:10:26.789 --> 00:10:29.485
Nope. I'm stuck
at a murder case.

164
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:32.961
(door thuds)

165
00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:37.933
Still with him. The American.

166
00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:40.764
Time just got away.

167
00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:43.939
Sorry.
Could be there in an hour.

168
00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:47.638
Oh. possibly.

169
00:10:47.674 --> 00:10:50.480
(ominous music)

170
00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:52.140
(door thuds)
(car alarm chirps)

171
00:10:52.176 --> 00:10:53.476
- [Marie]<i> Shall I wait to eat?</i>

172
00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.916
- Just one more
thing I've got to do.

173
00:10:56.951 --> 00:10:59.251
- [Marie]<i> Just</i>
<i> don't be too late.</i>

174
00:11:08.664 --> 00:11:12.264
(ominous music continues)

175
00:11:22.674 --> 00:11:23.814
- What?

176
00:11:25.382 --> 00:11:26.679
What do you want?

177
00:11:27.182 --> 00:11:28.852
- Are you aware of what
happened to your neighbor?

178
00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:31.787
- I told your guy the other day.

179
00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:34.990
I didn't see anything.
I didn't hear anything.

180
00:11:36.954 --> 00:11:38.125
- Is this yours?

181
00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:40.165
- Why?

182
00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:43.834
- Because it was found outside
Abigail Myres' apartment.

183
00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:47.094
Now. do you mind if
I take a look inside?

184
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.069
- You got a warrant?

185
00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:54.169
- Not yet.
- Well. fuck off then.

186
00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:57.815
Away from my property. officer.

187
00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.213
(door thuds)

188
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:06.582
(ominous music)

189
00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.293
- Oh. Hello.

190
00:12:16.328 --> 00:12:19.797
- DCI Boyd. Do you
mind if we have a word?

191
00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:21.371
- Come in.
Come in.

192
00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:23.566
I don't want him
to see us talking.

193
00:12:24.772 --> 00:12:27.078
(traffic whooshing)

194
00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.337
(door thuds)

195
00:12:28.439 --> 00:12:31.506
Avery Thompson is
not a pleasant man.

196
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.978
- Do you think he knows
something about Abigail?

197
00:12:34.013 --> 00:12:35.915
- I told Detective Chaudhry.

198
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.182
I did hear them
arguing recently.

199
00:12:38.218 --> 00:12:39.950
- Did you hear what
they were saying?

200
00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:42.688
(door thuds)
- Did you hear that?

201
00:12:42.723 --> 00:12:45.195
Ah. he's leaving.

202
00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:47.898
(ominous music)

203
00:12:50.466 --> 00:12:51.968
In a hurry.

204
00:12:53.768 --> 00:12:55.868
(car engine rumbles)

205
00:12:55.903 --> 00:12:57.303
- You were saying. Ms. Walsh?

206
00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:00.712
- Last week. Avery was livid

207
00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:03.639
because someone had
thrown an egg at his car.

208
00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.847
He accused Abigail.

209
00:13:05.882 --> 00:13:08.611
and there is
absolutely no way that

210
00:13:08.646 --> 00:13:11.449
that lovely young woman
would've done such a thing.

211
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:12.747
- An egg?

212
00:13:13.924 --> 00:13:17.926
What did he say to
Abigail? It's important.

213
00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:21.959
- He said he would deal
with her this time.

214
00:13:22.162 --> 00:13:24.097
I mean. it might
not mean anything.

215
00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:26.167
but you never know
with people these days.

216
00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:31.469
(bottle clinks)

217
00:13:36.007 --> 00:13:38.311
(birds chirping)

218
00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:42.711
(traffic noises)

219
00:13:42.746 --> 00:13:45.383
- Is there anything in
Avery Thompson's background

220
00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:48.721
that connects them?
- Still running background.

221
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.523
- And no physical evidence
linking him to the crime scene?

222
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.628
(phone ringing)
What's your opinion?

223
00:13:56.964 --> 00:13:58.664
Are your cases connected?

224
00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:02.173
- Oh. I'm not sure yet.

225
00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:04.271
(phone ringing)

226
00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:07.175
B! What's up?

227
00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.104
(crickets chirping)

228
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.708
(eerie music)

229
00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:43.011
(phone ringing)
(Dan sighs)

230
00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:44.606
- [Voicemail]<i> Your</i>
<i> call has been forwarded</i>

231
00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:46.643
<i> to an automatic voice</i>
<i> messaging service.</i>

232
00:14:49.245 --> 00:14:52.550
(thunder rumbling)

233
00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:02.497
(eerie music continues)

234
00:15:02.532 --> 00:15:03.935
(Dan sighs)

235
00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:13.010
(Grace giggles)

236
00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:19.918
(knocking on door)
- Hang on! I'm coming.

237
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.615
(eerie music continues)

238
00:15:26.018 --> 00:15:28.820
(Grace yelps)

239
00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:31.853
(lamp breaking)

240
00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:43.271
(eerie music continues)

241
00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:04.996
(Sarah laughing)

242
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.601
(Dan gasping)

243
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:22.981
(eerie music continues)

244
00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:26.578
(phone ringing)

245
00:16:29.418 --> 00:16:32.188
- [Glen]<i> I'm on my way.</i>
<i> I wanna check something out.</i>

246
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:37.052
- My ex-partner. Chicago PD.

247
00:16:37.088 --> 00:16:38.590
18 years.

248
00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.660
Very seasoned detective.

249
00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:45.531
Very clever.

250
00:16:47.968 --> 00:16:50.302
- Walker Bravo?

251
00:16:50.337 --> 00:16:54.142
- Yeah.
Yeah. He lives in London now.

252
00:16:54.177 --> 00:16:57.339
I had convinced him
to meet up with me.

253
00:16:57.374 --> 00:16:58.973
I wanna get his opinion.

254
00:17:01.052 --> 00:17:02.782
- I'd like to meet him.
if that's all right.

255
00:17:02.817 --> 00:17:04.220
- Mm. Mm-hm.

256
00:17:06.323 --> 00:17:10.886
So you get that shit
straightened out with your wife?

257
00:17:11.993 --> 00:17:16.326
I accidentally overheard

258
00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:18.828
your conversation yesterday.

259
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.774
- You know. when we lost Callum.

260
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.469
it just all fell apart.
- Mm.

261
00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:29.340
- The distance between us grew.

262
00:17:29.376 --> 00:17:33.876
And I just buried
myself at work.

263
00:17:35.879 --> 00:17:39.654
And in her moment of
grief and needing someone.

264
00:17:39.689 --> 00:17:40.916
she strayed.

265
00:17:42.091 --> 00:17:44.428
Wasn't there for her.
- Whoa.

266
00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:47.065
She was unfaithful?

267
00:17:49.093 --> 00:17:50.328
- Yeah.

268
00:17:50.364 --> 00:17:52.292
You know. I've
never told anyone.

269
00:17:52.328 --> 00:17:53.863
- Ah. Ah.

270
00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.203
- Work is just my escape.

271
00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:02.773
It's all I do.

272
00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:09.043
- You know. escape's fine.
But. that grief.

273
00:18:10.887 --> 00:18:13.520
grief will break you.

274
00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.534
Are we here?
- We are.

275
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.199
No. no. no. no. no.

276
00:18:25.301 --> 00:18:27.495
I think it's best you
just sit in the car.

277
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:30.240
Keep an eye out.
I'll be right back.

278
00:18:31.742 --> 00:18:34.409
(tense music)

279
00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:38.644
(footsteps clacking)

280
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.166
(tense music continues)
(letterbox squeaks)

281
00:18:55.665 --> 00:18:57.126
- Boyd!

282
00:18:57.962 --> 00:19:01.139
You wanna catch him. you
need to go to the back alley.

283
00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:04.835
(car engine starting)

284
00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:11.842
(Avery groaning)

285
00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:19.113
(car engine revving)

286
00:19:22.926 --> 00:19:25.288
(tense music continues)

287
00:19:25.323 --> 00:19:27.422
(tires crunching)

288
00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:28.793
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

289
00:19:30.663 --> 00:19:32.795
- Get down!
Did you kill Abigail Myres?

290
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.930
- I was at my work!
I told your officers.

291
00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:37.836
- [Glen]<i> I know you</i>
<i> were late for work.</i>

292
00:19:37.871 --> 00:19:41.402
- [Avery]<i> I'm always late.</i>
<i> I'm late every bloody night.</i>

293
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:43.003
- [Glen]<i> You got an alibi?</i>

294
00:19:43.038 --> 00:19:46.784
- I can prove I was
nowhere near her house

295
00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:49.512
at that time.
- By who?

296
00:19:49.547 --> 00:19:51.822
- Not by who!
By a camera.

297
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.251
I got flashed by a speed camera.

298
00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:56.124
Go on! Check that.

299
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.360
7:30 PM. 12 miles
away from here.

300
00:20:00.395 --> 00:20:04.028
That's incontrovertible
proof. officer!

301
00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:05.662
- So why did you run?

302
00:20:05.697 --> 00:20:07.332
- [Avery]<i> Because</i>
<i> I owe some money</i>

303
00:20:07.367 --> 00:20:09.202
to some bad people. all right?

304
00:20:09.237 --> 00:20:12.208
- Did you argue with Abigail?

305
00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:15.042
You find her attractive?
Did she turn you down?

306
00:20:15.144 --> 00:20:17.545
Eh?
- She's a dog minder.

307
00:20:18.678 --> 00:20:22.443
Her dogs bark all day
and I need my rest.

308
00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:24.420
So I lost it.

309
00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:32.387
- Go.
- Oh. don't worry about it.

310
00:20:32.423 --> 00:20:33.561
Any time. right?

311
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.696
Man.

312
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.469
Jesus. oh.

313
00:20:40.738 --> 00:20:42.702
(Dan groans)

314
00:20:46.173 --> 00:20:49.071
(somber music)

315
00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:09.399
(somber music continues)

316
00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.484
- Did you catch him?

317
00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:30.750
- No. not yet.

318
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.621
- You want to talk about it?

319
00:21:34.552 --> 00:21:37.251
- It's okay. It's late.

320
00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:42.894
(birds chirping)

321
00:21:44.398 --> 00:21:45.996
- [Marie]<i> You.</i>
- Hey.

322
00:21:47.229 --> 00:21:50.165
- Let's invite your
American round for dinner.

323
00:21:51.638 --> 00:21:53.542
- I don't think he's
the dinner type.

324
00:21:53.577 --> 00:21:56.376
- Well. twist his arm.
- What. here? At the house?

325
00:21:56.412 --> 00:21:59.880
- Yes. Just do it.
(phone ringing)

326
00:21:59.915 --> 00:22:01.011
Kessler.

327
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:03.915
- Hi.

328
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.920
(ominous music)
(camera shutter popping)

329
00:22:11.489 --> 00:22:15.131
(birds shrieking)

330
00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:16.862
Anyone else been in?
- No. sir.

331
00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:18.699
- [Glen]<i> Come on.</i>

332
00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:28.709
- I was the first to arrive
after the reported break in.

333
00:22:29.882 --> 00:22:31.745
(bead curtain rattles)

334
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:34.976
The postman noticed the back
door was open and called.

335
00:22:35.011 --> 00:22:37.451
- Take a statement
from the postman.

336
00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:39.952
Talk to the neighbors.
- Yes. boss.

337
00:22:40.454 --> 00:22:42.620
Oh. oh oh. Can't come in here.

338
00:22:42.656 --> 00:22:44.754
- [Dan]<i> I'm with</i>
<i> DCI Boyd. Boyd!</i>

339
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.991
- He's with me.
- All right. man.

340
00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:50.324
(ominous music)

341
00:23:07.415 --> 00:23:11.048
(ominous music continues)

342
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.722
- So what do you think?

343
00:23:15.555 --> 00:23:20.328
- Well. grabbed her by the hair.

344
00:23:20.364 --> 00:23:22.730
slammed her head
against this wall.

345
00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:26.701
Getting more violent
and less controlled.

346
00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:33.675
(bead curtain rattles)

347
00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:36.447
Ah.

348
00:23:38.015 --> 00:23:41.648
(Dan sniffing)

349
00:23:41.683 --> 00:23:44.455
What's that smell?
I've smelled it before.

350
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:48.624
- Resembles the
first crime scene.

351
00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:53.387
It's cleaning product.

352
00:23:54.594 --> 00:23:56.225
He's trying to hide his tracks.

353
00:23:57.067 --> 00:23:58.568
- Not so much.

354
00:24:00.369 --> 00:24:02.168
- [Glen]<i> More blood splatter.</i>

355
00:24:02.737 --> 00:24:06.367
- No. that is the front
edge of a footprint.

356
00:24:07.444 --> 00:24:10.140
- He's missed it.
- He's left it.

357
00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:14.180
(luminol whooshes)

358
00:24:14.216 --> 00:24:15.618
(light clicks)

359
00:24:19.289 --> 00:24:22.889
(ominous music continues)

360
00:24:39.342 --> 00:24:41.440
(ominous music continues)

361
00:24:41.476 --> 00:24:42.645
- [Glen]<i> I got something.</i>

362
00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:47.743
Another cross.
- Now that is an ankh.

363
00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.116
It's the Egyptian key to
the gates of eternal life.

364
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.494
- He believed he was
on a moral crusade?

365
00:24:58.196 --> 00:24:59.758
- Why did these serial killers

366
00:24:59.793 --> 00:25:04.029
always bring this
cult shit into it?

367
00:25:05.027 --> 00:25:06.498
- I wanna go back to Abigail's.

368
00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:10.098
- For what?
- 'Cause he's left a trail

369
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.268
and I believe we've
missed something.

370
00:25:22.649 --> 00:25:26.216
(ominous music continues)

371
00:25:34.995 --> 00:25:38.859
I don't see an ankh.
What are we missing here?

372
00:25:38.895 --> 00:25:40.670
- I'm not sure yet.

373
00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:46.874
Huh.
Now that's weird.

374
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.042
Menorahs are usually outside
a door or on a windowsill.

375
00:25:51.313 --> 00:25:53.881
(eerie music)

376
00:26:11.095 --> 00:26:15.398
(book thuds)
(eerie music continues)

377
00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:19.236
Huh.
- Mat 715.

378
00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:24.041
- The 715. That's our
Chicago case number.

379
00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:25.875
- I mean. how the fuck
does he know that?

380
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:30.280
- Or. "Beware false prophets

381
00:26:31.687 --> 00:26:34.751
who come to you in
sheep's clothing.

382
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.391
for inwardly they
are ravenous wolves."

383
00:26:38.626 --> 00:26:43.029
Matthew chapter 7 verse 15.

384
00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:46.997
- So he believes that Jews

385
00:26:47.033 --> 00:26:49.464
and Catholics are
the ravenous wolves?

386
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:53.611
(eerie music continues)

387
00:26:54.807 --> 00:26:56.570
- He's set himself a path.

388
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.784
This is just the beginning.

389
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.455
(eerie music continues)

390
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.281
- [Glen]<i> Mrs. Hall.</i>
<i> do you know anyone</i>

391
00:27:07.316 --> 00:27:09.790
who would wanna
harm your daughter?

392
00:27:09.826 --> 00:27:13.763
- She was the happiest.
most easy-going girl.

393
00:27:16.427 --> 00:27:19.428
A dedicated member of our
Catholic congregation.

394
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.310
- Any boyfriends.
girlfriends. exes?

395
00:27:28.345 --> 00:27:29.570
- Well. I don't know.

396
00:27:31.142 --> 00:27:35.244
Her ex-boyfriend.
Colin McGregor.

397
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:38.953
Met him once.
He seemed like a nice man.

398
00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:42.487
Though I recall
it ended abruptly.

399
00:27:42.523 --> 00:27:45.124
(eerie music)

400
00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:06.211
(phone ringing)

401
00:28:08.616 --> 00:28:10.182
- [Dan]<i> Hey. Walker B!</i>

402
00:28:13.283 --> 00:28:15.257
(eerie music continues)
- What we got?

403
00:28:15.626 --> 00:28:18.419
- No fingerprints
or DNA on record.

404
00:28:18.454 --> 00:28:21.061
- Avery's alibi has
come back corroborated.

405
00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:26.297
(eerie music continues)

406
00:28:28.005 --> 00:28:30.505
- Holds a firearm license.
- Mm. Doesn't mean he's a man

407
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.367
who can carve through a neck.

408
00:28:32.403 --> 00:28:35.001
arrange arms and feet
in a neat little cross.

409
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.813
- It's worth a visit.

410
00:28:51.055 --> 00:28:53.453
- What part of I moved to London

411
00:28:53.489 --> 00:28:56.028
to get away from all
this confuses you?

412
00:28:56.064 --> 00:28:59.229
- Ah. I heard about this
new passion of yours.

413
00:28:59.264 --> 00:29:01.704
The writing.
- The only crime scenes I want

414
00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:04.404
to talk about are the
ones I write about.

415
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.510
(Dan chuckles)

416
00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:08.840
I had to replace
drinking with something.

417
00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:12.173
- You just up and walked away.

418
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:14.408
- Even if I had your instincts.

419
00:29:14.443 --> 00:29:16.479
I was never strong
enough on detail.

420
00:29:16.882 --> 00:29:19.185
That was your gift.

421
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.454
You were a great teacher
with your exactitude of detail.

422
00:29:23.857 --> 00:29:27.424
But it became infuriating.

423
00:29:29.227 --> 00:29:32.565
I prefer telling
stories to reality.

424
00:29:32.601 --> 00:29:33.932
It's less stressful.

425
00:29:33.968 --> 00:29:36.631
- Yeah reality can
be a bitch. huh?

426
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.370
- Their faces still haunt me.

427
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:45.541
He changed both our lives.

428
00:29:46.812 --> 00:29:47.983
That's why I left.

429
00:29:49.412 --> 00:29:52.383
- Was it hard to quit?
- The police?

430
00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.220
- The bottle?

431
00:29:55.753 --> 00:29:56.794
- Mm.

432
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:00.961
- So what's up with you
and this security thing?

433
00:30:00.996 --> 00:30:05.902
- Pays the bills.
I design alarm systems.

434
00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:09.097
And what about you?
Apart from getting older. huh?

435
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:12.406
You met someone who can put
up with your charming self?

436
00:30:12.441 --> 00:30:13.571
(Dan scoffs)

437
00:30:13.606 --> 00:30:14.735
Oh boy.

438
00:30:15.412 --> 00:30:16.341
What happened?

439
00:30:18.974 --> 00:30:20.246
- Sarah.

440
00:30:21.411 --> 00:30:25.746
I can't stop
thinking about Sarah.

441
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.125
(Walker sighs)

442
00:30:32.823 --> 00:30:33.831
- So

443
00:30:36.633 --> 00:30:41.633
what can I do for you. stranger?

444
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:43.874
(eerie music)

445
00:30:44.639 --> 00:30:47.702
(gravel crunching)

446
00:30:50.778 --> 00:30:54.280
(eerie music continues)

447
00:30:57.388 --> 00:31:00.891
(knuckles tapping)

448
00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:06.864
(footsteps thudding)

449
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.509
- DCI Boyd. I'm here
about the murder

450
00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.178
of your ex-partner. Grace Hall.

451
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:22.341
- Murdered?

452
00:31:23.974 --> 00:31:25.212
Oh my God.

453
00:31:25.915 --> 00:31:27.547
- Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

454
00:31:27.583 --> 00:31:28.745
- No. of course.

455
00:31:29.514 --> 00:31:31.979
- Where were you on
Thursday night? The 23rd?

456
00:31:32.014 --> 00:31:34.119
- Mm.

457
00:31:34.154 --> 00:31:36.691
Why are you asking
me my whereabouts?

458
00:31:36.726 --> 00:31:38.528
I am definitely not a suspect.

459
00:31:38.764 --> 00:31:40.593
- Well. do you have
a problem answering?

460
00:31:40.996 --> 00:31:42.698
- No. just given
the circumstances

461
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.691
I think I'd rather
call my lawyer.

462
00:31:44.727 --> 00:31:46.398
- Well. you can't just
tell me where you were?

463
00:31:46.433 --> 00:31:48.565
- Well. I can. but I'd
prefer my lawyer was present.

464
00:31:49.566 --> 00:31:51.804
- Simple question.
Where were you then?

465
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.537
- Are you hard of hearing?

466
00:31:57.345 --> 00:32:00.479
As I've already made clear.
I was not involved.

467
00:32:01.382 --> 00:32:04.215
I have a concrete alibi
for the night of the 23rd.

468
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.253
I was at a warehouse
in Manchester.

469
00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:08.985
I work for ATEM Security.

470
00:32:09.021 --> 00:32:11.192
Multiple witnesses.

471
00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:16.162
Is this really necessary?

472
00:32:16.197 --> 00:32:18.364
- And when did you
return from Manchester?

473
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:24.238
- [Colin]<i> Not 'til</i>
<i> the night of the 24th.</i>

474
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.715
- [Glen]<i> What happened</i>
<i> to your forehead?</i>

475
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.412
<i> For the purpose</i>
<i> of the interview.</i>

476
00:32:33.447 --> 00:32:37.211
<i> Mr. McGregor has a bump</i>
<i> on the top right hand-side</i>

477
00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:38.384
<i> of his forehead.</i>

478
00:32:40.253 --> 00:32:43.386
- I dropped my phone
under the table.

479
00:32:43.421 --> 00:32:45.490
I bent down to pick
it up. and boom.

480
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.695
It was actually
quite a sore one.

481
00:32:49.097 --> 00:32:50.863
- Do you still
hunt. Mr. McGregor?

482
00:32:50.898 --> 00:32:52.032
- Why are you asking?

483
00:32:52.301 --> 00:32:55.032
- Well. I see you still
have your firearm license.

484
00:32:55.068 --> 00:32:56.567
- Well. then I guess I do.

485
00:32:57.971 --> 00:33:01.042
- Right. Ms. Grace Hall.

486
00:33:01.078 --> 00:33:03.204
How long were you in a
relationship with her?

487
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.115
- Mm.
Too long.

488
00:33:07.112 --> 00:33:08.714
She was a lost soul.

489
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.345
(ominous music)

490
00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:12.614
- [Glen]<i> Do you have any idea</i>

491
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.582
<i> who would want your</i>
<i> ex-girlfriend dead?</i>

492
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:18.160
- Well. like I
say. she was lost.

493
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.461
- And what makes someone
lost in your eyes?

494
00:33:23.632 --> 00:33:25.167
Easily led?

495
00:33:26.263 --> 00:33:28.137
Liked by other boys?

496
00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:33.835
- We're all lost
in life sometimes.

497
00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:36.645
aren't we. Detective Boyd?

498
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.079
(ominous music continues)

499
00:33:38.115 --> 00:33:40.446
The important thing is
to find our way home.

500
00:33:42.116 --> 00:33:46.117
- Yeah.
In your relationship.

501
00:33:46.152 --> 00:33:49.153
did you try and guide her home?

502
00:33:49.188 --> 00:33:50.817
- Like I say. all I want is

503
00:33:50.852 --> 00:33:53.186
to see who's responsible
for this locked up.

504
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:56.430
- On the night of
the 12th of March.

505
00:33:57.133 --> 00:33:59.234
where were you?
- What relevance is that?

506
00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:03.436
- [Glen]<i> I just wanna</i>
<i> make sure your client</i>

507
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:06.303
<i> didn't have any other</i>
<i> violent urges that night.</i>

508
00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:08.375
- I think this is
over. don't you?

509
00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:17.846
- [Glen]<i> Thanks for</i>
<i> helping with this. Walker.</i>

510
00:34:19.554 --> 00:34:21.955
<i> The website states that</i>
<i> McGregor used to be a member</i>

511
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:24.651
<i> of the Kildaton Cross sect.</i>

512
00:34:24.687 --> 00:34:27.059
- We explored many
sects and cults.

513
00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.858
- Yeah. but we don't have
that many in Scotland.

514
00:34:30.425 --> 00:34:31.864
What's this cross?

515
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.968
- Probably from a religious
group from the 1st century

516
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.775
who believed in anti-cosmic
world rejection.

517
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.308
This was a deeper philosophy.

518
00:34:42.343 --> 00:34:44.544
They believed in their
own moral compass.

519
00:34:44.913 --> 00:34:46.116
Thought they were God.

520
00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:49.242
- What do you know
about the ankh?

521
00:34:49.277 --> 00:34:50.987
- Ankh.

522
00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.888
- The ankh.
- Embraced by Christianity.

523
00:34:53.924 --> 00:34:56.087
then accepted by
pagans and cults

524
00:34:56.122 --> 00:34:57.518
- Key to the afterlife.

525
00:34:57.721 --> 00:35:00.492
Maybe he thought he
was releasing her

526
00:35:00.527 --> 00:35:03.332
from this life and
ushering her into the next.

527
00:35:03.535 --> 00:35:06.136
(ominous music)

528
00:35:08.705 --> 00:35:11.735
(wind whooshing)

529
00:35:28.621 --> 00:35:31.157
- So we have the cross
and we have the verse.

530
00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:33.387
Obviously wants us to
know what he's doing.

531
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.825
If we can match the symbol
from Grace's house with a sect.

532
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:42.397
- Look. murders in the UK
and Chicago are similar.

533
00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:45.206
but they're not satanic.

534
00:35:45.242 --> 00:35:47.143
- Well. we're checking
all previous locations

535
00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:50.279
used by the sect.
- Pay them a visit when you do.

536
00:35:51.346 --> 00:35:53.248
- The American case
file says the victims

537
00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:55.413
had jewelry removed. which
were never recovered.

538
00:35:55.448 --> 00:35:57.316
- It's not unusual
for serial killers

539
00:35:57.351 --> 00:35:59.156
to keep a trophy
from their victims.

540
00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:02.786
(ominous music)

541
00:36:10.965 --> 00:36:13.698
(Colin panting)

542
00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:22.608
(ominous music continues)

543
00:36:35.289 --> 00:36:38.484
(door thuds)
(gravel crunching)

544
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.527
(crow cawing)

545
00:36:40.963 --> 00:36:43.698
- Hey. hey. Who are you?

546
00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.502
A journalist?

547
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:46.896
- DCI Boyd.

548
00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:49.404
What can you tell
me about this guy?

549
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:52.867
- He could not adhere
to our beliefs.

550
00:36:52.902 --> 00:36:55.339
Around six months
ago. he was dismissed.

551
00:36:55.574 --> 00:36:56.939
(eerie music)
- What are your beliefs?

552
00:36:56.974 --> 00:36:59.048
- That's none of your concern.
- Well. I'm intrigued.

553
00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:01.381
- You're a pretender.
- Excuse me?

554
00:37:01.417 --> 00:37:04.079
- You lot proclaim to
remove sin from society.

555
00:37:04.515 --> 00:37:06.055
But how can you remove sin

556
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.818
when you are riddled
with corruption?

557
00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:10.489
- I see.

558
00:37:10.524 --> 00:37:14.130
- You visit unannounced
private property.

559
00:37:14.166 --> 00:37:17.531
- Gentlemen. please let
me speak with our guest.

560
00:37:18.364 --> 00:37:20.237
I advise you to walk with me.

561
00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:26.705
We are not a cult.
rather a calling.

562
00:37:28.275 --> 00:37:30.037
- I wanna ask if a former member

563
00:37:30.072 --> 00:37:33.415
may have taken your
beliefs one step too far.

564
00:37:34.747 --> 00:37:36.847
- This have anything to
do with your murders?

565
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.823
- I never told you I was
working on a murder case.

566
00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:42.223
- We monitor our website

567
00:37:42.258 --> 00:37:44.393
and social visitors.
Detective Boyd.

568
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:49.462
As strong as we
believe in our calling.

569
00:37:49.731 --> 00:37:53.395
we may condemn the world.
but we do not murder sheep.

570
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.964
We are not wolves.

571
00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:58.002
- This ankh.

572
00:37:58.704 --> 00:38:00.541
Think it's similar to
your Kildaton Cross?

573
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:03.379
- And many more.

574
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.347
- You think Colin McGregor's
capable of murder?

575
00:38:06.383 --> 00:38:08.945
- He's not one of us anymore.
Did not comply.

576
00:38:10.646 --> 00:38:11.915
- Let me ask you again.

577
00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:17.019
Is Colin McGregor
capable of murder?

578
00:38:17.588 --> 00:38:19.923
- Do not smear our church. boy.

579
00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.700
I think you should go

580
00:38:24.436 --> 00:38:27.128
unless you really want to
test my theory about sheep.

581
00:38:28.797 --> 00:38:32.474
(ominous music continues)

582
00:38:37.509 --> 00:38:39.743
- Marie. you are a gorgeous host

583
00:38:39.779 --> 00:38:42.809
and that food was to die for.
- Oh. thank you.

584
00:38:42.844 --> 00:38:45.146
- Be careful. He's a charmer.

585
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.392
- All joking aside. I don't
remember the last time

586
00:38:51.427 --> 00:38:53.458
we actually had people
around for dinner.

587
00:38:53.494 --> 00:38:55.194
- I am in love
with your country.

588
00:38:55.463 --> 00:38:59.067
but France will
always have my heart.

589
00:38:59.102 --> 00:39:01.435
- Ah. France is delightful.

590
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:05.133
But my love for golf
has always made me lust

591
00:39:05.168 --> 00:39:09.507
for the Emerald Isle.
I cannot wait to play Galway.

592
00:39:09.543 --> 00:39:10.774
- You know. when
this is all over.

593
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.681
there's nothing stopping
you going to Ireland.

594
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.450
- I'm gonna get some more wine.

595
00:39:20.323 --> 00:39:22.949
- So from witch
hunt to police hunt.

596
00:39:22.985 --> 00:39:24.986
I was chased away
by a mob today.

597
00:39:25.022 --> 00:39:28.755
And apparently. McGregor
was canceled by the sect

598
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:30.332
for being too radical.

599
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:32.462
- Akin to getting kicked
out of the Ku Klux Klan

600
00:39:32.497 --> 00:39:33.568
for being too racist?

601
00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:35.403
May I help?

602
00:39:35.572 --> 00:39:37.268
- [Marie]<i> Oh. yes. Can you</i>
<i> grab the glasses for me?</i>

603
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.009
- So you a soccer fan?

604
00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.506
- Oh that?
Yeah. Celtic.

605
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:43.972
Through and through.
And you?

606
00:39:44.007 --> 00:39:47.109
- Drinker. golfer.
(Dan and Glen laughing)

607
00:39:47.144 --> 00:39:49.815
- So what made you want to
escape all of this. then?

608
00:39:51.652 --> 00:39:53.779
- You don't have to
always play the hand you

609
00:39:53.815 --> 00:39:55.187
were dealt in life.

610
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.988
That hand had me on
the wrong course.

611
00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:00.254
- Work got too much?

612
00:40:02.495 --> 00:40:03.829
- I reached the dead end.

613
00:40:06.498 --> 00:40:07.701
Something happened.

614
00:40:11.107 --> 00:40:12.541
I had to change course.

615
00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:20.415
But an expensive
yet wise therapist

616
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.881
once gave me a very
good piece of advice.

617
00:40:22.916 --> 00:40:27.013
- Oh yeah? Tell me.
- Find yourself a British girl.

618
00:40:27.049 --> 00:40:29.349
I did find myself
a British girl.

619
00:40:30.389 --> 00:40:31.994
- Take the wine.

620
00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:34.387
Right. let's do this.

621
00:40:36.027 --> 00:40:38.292
Oh wait. I'm just gonna
take the cling film off.

622
00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:40.935
- Appreciate it.

623
00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.236
(ominous music)

624
00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:44.573
(Marie and Walker laughing)

625
00:40:46.774 --> 00:40:48.643
- [Marie]<i> It is all</i>
<i> about the presentation.</i>

626
00:40:53.446 --> 00:40:55.111
Good to go?
- Yeah.

627
00:40:56.786 --> 00:41:02.151
- The important thing about
grief is how you deal with it.

628
00:41:03.452 --> 00:41:07.962
The consequences of a wrongful
act can destroy any hope.

629
00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:09.092
(plate clatters)

630
00:41:10.993 --> 00:41:13.767
- Cheese. anyone.
- I'm sorry.

631
00:41:13.802 --> 00:41:16.195
I think you might have
gotten the wrong impression.

632
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.273
- Babe. he was
talking about Callum.

633
00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:20.840
Nothing else.
(somber music)

634
00:41:24.312 --> 00:41:25.741
- The ultimate pain.

635
00:41:26.077 --> 00:41:28.441
Life prepares us to say
goodbye to our elders.

636
00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:33.084
never the children.
- Yeah.

637
00:41:33.954 --> 00:41:36.751
The important thing is
how you react to the pain.

638
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.662
- React?
Is that really what matters?

639
00:41:43.499 --> 00:41:45.631
You can't judge a
person's actions

640
00:41:45.666 --> 00:41:48.098
when their sanity
has been stripped.

641
00:41:57.774 --> 00:42:00.111
Did you tell Lawson

642
00:42:00.613 --> 00:42:04.114
about what happened with me?

643
00:42:12.821 --> 00:42:16.225
(insects chirping)

644
00:42:18.629 --> 00:42:20.468
(melancholy music)

645
00:42:20.503 --> 00:42:22.572
- We don't talk
about Callum anymore.

646
00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:33.979
It's not your fault.

647
00:42:35.745 --> 00:42:37.411
I just miss him.

648
00:42:38.753 --> 00:42:41.481
(melancholy music continues)
And I miss you.

649
00:42:44.193 --> 00:42:45.562
And I miss us.

650
00:42:54.665 --> 00:42:56.496
(Marie sniffles)

651
00:42:58.235 --> 00:43:00.843
- It destroyed me.
(melancholy music continues)

652
00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:03.613
It really destroyed me.

653
00:43:10.846 --> 00:43:12.248
I don't blame you.

654
00:43:17.051 --> 00:43:18.628
- Should we try again?

655
00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:22.698
I know nothing will ever
replace Callum but...

656
00:43:29.304 --> 00:43:30.706
(Marie sighs)

657
00:43:41.613 --> 00:43:43.147
(Marie sniffles)

658
00:43:46.787 --> 00:43:50.660
(insects chirping)
(birds chirping)

659
00:43:52.757 --> 00:43:54.224
- What's worth a smile?

660
00:43:58.662 --> 00:43:59.636
What's that?

661
00:44:01.268 --> 00:44:02.562
Italy?

662
00:44:04.603 --> 00:44:06.306
We are?
- Mm-hm.

663
00:44:06.508 --> 00:44:08.737
Amalfi Coast. just you and me.

664
00:44:08.773 --> 00:44:10.671
Hotel Bella Riviera.

665
00:44:11.073 --> 00:44:13.573
- Ooh.
Where I proposed.

666
00:44:14.782 --> 00:44:17.578
When?
- When you close the case.

667
00:44:18.247 --> 00:44:20.452
- I better go catch
my killer then.

668
00:44:20.487 --> 00:44:21.691
- Yes. you better.

669
00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.588
- See you.
- [Marie]<i> Bye.</i>

670
00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:33.263
(phones ringing)
- Are you sure?

671
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:40.300
McGregor's alibi checks out.
He was seen in a bar talking

672
00:44:40.335 --> 00:44:42.568
to two girls in
Manchester at 10:00 PM.

673
00:44:42.604 --> 00:44:45.811
and then seen the following
morning at 9:30 AM.

674
00:44:45.847 --> 00:44:48.546
- So how long from
Manchester to here?

675
00:44:48.948 --> 00:44:51.410
- That time of
night? Three hours.

676
00:44:51.446 --> 00:44:53.547
I mean it's tight.
but it is possible.

677
00:44:57.187 --> 00:44:58.856
- And I got a
delivery yesterday.

678
00:44:58.892 --> 00:45:00.993
and that reminded
me of something

679
00:45:01.029 --> 00:45:03.397
that happened a couple of
days before the murder.

680
00:45:03.966 --> 00:45:07.961
There was this man. he was
hanging about her street.

681
00:45:08.397 --> 00:45:11.665
- What man?
- Just a man on the street.

682
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:16.474
But he was holding a box like
he was delivering something.

683
00:45:17.043 --> 00:45:19.214
But delivery men. they
usually drive around

684
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.640
in those big trucks.

685
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:23.852
- Ms. Walsh. do you remember
what this man looked like?

686
00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:26.514
- I imagine I do. Yes.

687
00:45:30.757 --> 00:45:34.963
Oh.
Oh. it could be him.

688
00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:36.491
Oh.

689
00:45:38.264 --> 00:45:40.836
- We got motive under the
umbrella of religiphobia.

690
00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:43.767
And now we can place him at
the scene of the first murder.

691
00:45:43.935 --> 00:45:46.234
We have enough to bring him in.

692
00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:48.842
- Assemble a fully-armed
response unit.

693
00:45:48.878 --> 00:45:51.207
Bringing him in may not
be so easy this time.

694
00:45:51.242 --> 00:45:53.712
- Yeah. let's do it.
- With him being armed.

695
00:45:53.747 --> 00:45:55.211
I'd prefer you sit this one out.

696
00:45:55.246 --> 00:45:57.181
- I didn't come here
to sit on the sideline.

697
00:45:57.217 --> 00:45:59.415
- [Kessler]<i> Sorry.</i>
<i> detective. It's protocol.</i>

698
00:46:03.394 --> 00:46:07.193
(book thuds)
(tense music)

699
00:46:07.228 --> 00:46:11.031
- [Glen]<i> If suspect attempts</i>
<i> to run. do not pursue</i> .

700
00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:13.968
<i> We cannot have armed</i>
<i> officers on a public street.</i>

701
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.085
(radio chatter)

702
00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:35.715
- We have eyes on McGregor.

703
00:46:42.431 --> 00:46:43.800
<i> All in position.</i>

704
00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:49.432
(tense music continues)

705
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:53.601
Permission to move in. ma'am?

706
00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:55.871
- Granted.

707
00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.947
- [Glen]<i> Strike.</i>

- Has he called his lawyer?

736
00:49:04.204 --> 00:49:07.607
No. We are doing this
by the book. okay?

737
00:49:08.142 --> 00:49:10.413
Mr. McGregor can spend
the night in a cell.

738
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:12.743
You go home and rest.

(door opens)

766
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:11.143
- I'm glad you came.

767
00:53:17.123 --> 00:53:18.686
Sorry for your loss.

768
00:53:18.721 --> 00:53:22.198
It's nothing less
than overwhelming.

769
00:53:23.463 --> 00:53:25.729
- Sounds like you
talk from experience.

770
00:53:27.665 --> 00:53:29.537
- It's the reason
I gave up drinking.

771
00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:32.000
- Because of your
case in Chicago?

772
00:53:32.236 --> 00:53:34.036
- Yeah. maybe.

773
00:53:34.071 --> 00:53:35.068
I guess.

774
00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:44.077
- Sometimes giving up
seems like an easy option.

775
00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:48.150
- He who conquers. endures.

776
00:53:48.686 --> 00:53:51.193
That's why I came
to Scotland. really.

777
00:53:51.229 --> 00:53:53.823
- I thought you wanted
to put it all behind you.

778
00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:57.997
- You never truly
leave anything behind.

779
00:53:58.366 --> 00:54:00.498
It has a strange way
of following you around

780
00:54:00.534 --> 00:54:03.195
wherever you go.
Doesn't matter how slow you go.

781
00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:06.270
as long as you do not stop.

782
00:54:06.605 --> 00:54:09.808
That's why you must
continue on this case.

783
00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.380
(tense music)
Don't stop.

784
00:54:13.612 --> 00:54:18.111
I can help. but I need
to know everything.

785
00:54:22.049 --> 00:54:24.887
How close are you
really to catching him?

786
00:54:27.192 --> 00:54:29.498
(phone buzzing)

787
00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:30.464
- Boyd.

788
00:54:33.463 --> 00:54:34.730
(tense music continues)

789
00:54:34.766 --> 00:54:36.838
- The medical examiner
estimates time of death

790
00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:38.398
to be around 5:00 PM.

791
00:54:38.934 --> 00:54:41.277
based on the remains
found at the house.

792
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.048
Okay. so we can't
rule out McGregor.

793
00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:47.580
He could have
murdered Marie Boyd

794
00:54:47.616 --> 00:54:49.783
and returned to the house
by the time we arrested him.

795
00:54:50.118 --> 00:54:51.781
SOCO's on site at Gorkie Park.

796
00:54:51.816 --> 00:54:54.515
recovering what we believe
to be Marie's torso.

797
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.920
(tense music continues)

798
00:55:00.588 --> 00:55:03.632

799
00:55:03.668 --> 00:55:07.796

00:55:07.832 --> 00:55:11.406
(camera shutter clicking)
(water whooshing)

801
00:55:13.804 --> 00:55:15.575
(doors thudding)
- Boss. you can't be here.

802
00:55:16.307 --> 00:55:17.906
Boss!
- Glen!

803
00:55:17.942 --> 00:55:19.209
- [Officer]<i> The super</i>
<i> gave orders. you can't-</i>

804
00:55:19.244 --> 00:55:20.244
- Move!
- Sir?

805
00:55:20.279 --> 00:55:21.414
- Glen.
listen to me.

806
00:55:21.449 --> 00:55:23.646
- Boss. Kessler says
you're not to be here.

807
00:55:23.681 --> 00:55:24.952
- Is it Marie?
- Listen to me. Glen.

808
00:55:24.987 --> 00:55:26.421
- Is it Marie?
- Boss.

809
00:55:27.481 --> 00:55:28.522
- Glen!

810
00:55:32.927 --> 00:55:34.760
Hey.
Hey.

811
00:55:35.263 --> 00:55:38.864
Stay in control.
Focus. focus.

812
00:55:39.133 --> 00:55:40.934
- I'm gonna kill him.

813
00:55:41.537 --> 00:55:44.462
I'm gonna kill him.
- [Walker] Come on. Come on.

814
00:55:44.865 --> 00:55:49.104
(ominous music continues)

815
00:55:49.139 --> 00:55:51.278
- [Kessler]<i> What you doing</i>
<i>outside of Abigail Myres' home?</i>

816
00:55:51.313 --> 00:55:53.414
- Purely coincidental.
superintendent.

817
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.607
- Well. that's a bit a
stretch. don't you think?

818
00:55:55.876 --> 00:55:57.284
We have a witness who says-

819
00:55:57.319 --> 00:55:59.583
- You mean the
unhinged elderly women

820
00:55:59.619 --> 00:56:01.352
who was shouting at
me in the street?

821
00:56:01.387 --> 00:56:02.853
- You don't deny being there?

822
00:56:04.686 --> 00:56:07.287
Is it not coincidental

823
00:56:08.056 --> 00:56:12.199
that whoever killed
your ex. Grace Hall.

824
00:56:12.568 --> 00:56:16.169
left her body exactly the
same way as Abigail Myres.

825
00:56:16.204 --> 00:56:18.303
who you claim to have never met

826
00:56:18.638 --> 00:56:20.635
even though we have
witnesses placing you

827
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.571
there hours before the murder?

828
00:56:23.074 --> 00:56:25.971
We know you were fired from
your job four days prior.

829
00:56:26.373 --> 00:56:30.815
- I fit alarm systems.
I was out handing out flyers.

830
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.481
She didn't like me loitering.
So I told her to go and

831
00:56:33.517 --> 00:56:34.555
- Let me take this.

832
00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:37.016
Please tell me you have

833
00:56:37.051 --> 00:56:39.153
a more reliable
witness. Superintendent.

834
00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:42.458
I would also add that nothing
places my client there

835
00:56:42.494 --> 00:56:43.961
at the time of the murder.

836
00:56:44.063 --> 00:56:46.829
- [Kessler]<i> Have you ever</i>
<i> visited America. Mr. McGregor?</i>

837
00:56:46.865 --> 00:56:49.794
- It's my favorite place
to go when I'm bored.

838
00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:51.363
Disney World. once.

839
00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:56.677
A few other times.
(ominous music)

840
00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:57.710
Hm.

841
00:56:59.745 --> 00:57:02.483
You know. I met a
foreigner once in London

842
00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:06.511
after a convention.
Oh. he could drink whiskey.

843
00:57:07.348 --> 00:57:11.020
He ranted about these
unsolved murders of women.

844
00:57:11.055 --> 00:57:14.391
Said some lunatic left her
arms and legs in a cross.

845
00:57:14.427 --> 00:57:16.764
just like in your photos.

846
00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:19.325
- [Kessler]<i> What did</i>
<i> the foreigner look like?</i>

847
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.902
- Dark hair or salt and
pepper. maybe. I'm blanking.

848
00:57:23.937 --> 00:57:27.366
- Did he have scars? Tattoos?
What was his height? Build.

849
00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:29.937
- Did you enjoy hacking
those girls to pieces?

850
00:57:29.973 --> 00:57:31.343
- Oh. nice to see
you. my old friend.

851
00:57:31.378 --> 00:57:32.842
You get bored just watching?

852
00:57:32.877 --> 00:57:34.114
- I'm not gonna stop
'til I take you down.

853
00:57:34.149 --> 00:57:35.349
- Get him out of here.

854
00:57:35.384 --> 00:57:37.419
- [Dan] Glen! Glen!
- Stay with him!

855
00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:39.587
(ominous music continues)
- I'll be seeing you.

856
00:57:41.319 --> 00:57:42.821
- May I...

857
00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:48.058
- Interview interrupted
by DCI Glen Boyd

858
00:57:48.093 --> 00:57:52.666
and resumed with Mr. Dan Lawson
of Chicago Police present.

859
00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.572
- What religion are you?

860
00:58:00.569 --> 00:58:01.576
An atheist?

861
00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:06.445
- Men with no raison d'etre.

862
00:58:06.481 --> 00:58:09.050
I have a purpose in life.
- Oh.

863
00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.986
Man who likes to
show people the way.

864
00:58:12.022 --> 00:58:14.079
Grace Hall was lost.

865
00:58:14.315 --> 00:58:16.353
Did you help her?
(ominous music continues)

866
00:58:16.689 --> 00:58:18.593
- We all have a
calling. don't we?

867
00:58:19.854 --> 00:58:21.427
She was a Catholic.

868
00:58:21.463 --> 00:58:23.156
She should have
asked her priest.

869
00:58:23.191 --> 00:58:26.958
- And Abigail should
have asked her rabbi.

870
00:58:26.994 --> 00:58:30.132
(ominous music continues)

871
00:58:32.136 --> 00:58:35.973
Are you a wolf in sheep's
clothing. Mr. McGregor?

872
00:58:38.874 --> 00:58:40.377
- [Solicitor]<i> This is over.</i>

873
00:58:40.879 --> 00:58:44.179
I think it's time you
released my client.

874
00:58:45.484 --> 00:58:47.253
- Foreigner. Foreigner.

875
00:58:47.288 --> 00:58:48.557
He's playing with us.

876
00:58:50.457 --> 00:58:52.319
- Condolences for your wife.

877
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.432
- You let him go?

878
00:58:58.467 --> 00:59:00.333
- We don't have
enough to charge him.

879
00:59:00.368 --> 00:59:02.464
You could blow this whole case.

880
00:59:02.666 --> 00:59:04.031
Do you want him to walk

881
00:59:04.067 --> 00:59:05.840
on a technicality
for what he's done?

882
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:08.071
- I want him dead
for what he's done.

883
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:13.010
Dead!
- Don't fuck this up. Glen.

884
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.080
(somber music)

885
00:59:25.886 --> 00:59:28.520
(car roaring)

886
00:59:34.236 --> 00:59:37.738
(somber music continues)

887
00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.843
- Kessler's gonna
want me off the case.

888
00:59:45.011 --> 00:59:47.148
Because of Marie. she
thinks I've lost my head.

889
00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:49.013
- Well. maybe you have.

890
00:59:52.554 --> 00:59:55.080
- It's McGregor.
I know that it is.

891
00:59:55.115 --> 00:59:57.052
Every lead gets back to him.

892
00:59:57.087 --> 01:00:00.325
- Don't let him live
in your head. Glen.

893
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.597
You can't do that.

894
01:00:04.762 --> 01:00:08.027
- I've looked killers in the eye

895
01:00:08.463 --> 01:00:13.905
and there's something
soulless about their gaze.

896
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:16.434
- People who've lost their
way have the same look.

897
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:19.939
Not just killers.
(ominous music continues)

898
01:00:19.975 --> 01:00:21.076
- Well. it doesn't matter

899
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:24.620
because what Kessler
wants. Kessler gets.

900
01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.287
- You never struck
me as the kinda guy

901
01:00:27.322 --> 01:00:29.857
who followed the rules.

902
01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.155
- What choice do I have?

903
01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:35.263
- Listen-

904
01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.062
- Dan. I need to
be on this case.

905
01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.767
I want him-
- Listen to me.

906
01:00:42.802 --> 01:00:47.966
- To suffer.
- You have to calm down

907
01:00:48.002 --> 01:00:49.902
and figure this out.

908
01:00:50.338 --> 01:00:53.143
You can't just look
in one direction.

909
01:00:55.977 --> 01:00:58.786
Believe me. this pain

910
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.250
will eat away at your insides

911
01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:07.459
'til you don't
recognize yourself.

912
01:01:07.495 --> 01:01:10.391
(ominous music continues)

913
01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.426
My case.

914
01:01:13.366 --> 01:01:15.165
case 715.

915
01:01:17.603 --> 01:01:19.604
- Sarah. Sarah Christie.

916
01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:23.135
- She was the love of my life.

917
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:24.946
She meant everything to me.

918
01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:26.981
- She was your girlfriend?

919
01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.046
- Yeah.

920
01:01:30.045 --> 01:01:32.210
- They let you investigate?

921
01:01:32.479 --> 01:01:35.284
- Walker was the only
person that knew.

922
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.649
Hey.

923
01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:42.027
Tonight. we mourn.

924
01:01:43.892 --> 01:01:47.736
Tomorrow we hunt.

925
01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:52.334
(glasses clinking)

926
01:01:56.975 --> 01:02:00.815
(melancholy music)
(traffic noises)

927
01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.554
(phone ringing)

928
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:12.255
Hey. truth'll come to light.

929
01:02:13.022 --> 01:02:14.653
Kessler's put a tail on him.

930
01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:26.931
So you ever tell anybody
else about Marie's affair?

931
01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:30.009
(ominous music)

932
01:02:31.108 --> 01:02:34.712
- What?
- Jealous lover or somebody?

933
01:02:35.047 --> 01:02:37.417
They could. you know.
use it to frame you.

934
01:02:37.452 --> 01:02:39.084
Prove you had motive.

935
01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:44.221
I'm just saying.
(ominous music continues)

936
01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:48.456
Walker called.
He asked about you.

937
01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:54.803
(ominous music continues)

938
01:02:58.633 --> 01:03:01.533
- Somebody told him about
the Chicago homicides

939
01:03:01.568 --> 01:03:04.111
and how all the body
parts were positioned.

940
01:03:04.546 --> 01:03:06.080
- You mean the inverted cross?

941
01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:06.981
- Yeah.

942
01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.576
- Did he say what
this guy looked like?

943
01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:14.287
- A cute smile.

944
01:03:14.723 --> 01:03:16.484
He knows more. He's
playing with us.

945
01:03:18.084 --> 01:03:19.254
- What else?

946
01:03:19.289 --> 01:03:21.160
It's important you don't
leave anything out.

947
01:03:21.496 --> 01:03:22.897
- He hates religion

948
01:03:23.795 --> 01:03:25.261
and he's calculated.

949
01:03:25.297 --> 01:03:27.495
He leaves us nothing we
can incriminate him with.

950
01:03:28.999 --> 01:03:31.400
- So you just let him walk?

951
01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:33.974
Where is he now?

952
01:03:35.305 --> 01:03:38.275
- Probably getting
drunk at the Tower Bar.

953
01:03:40.009 --> 01:03:41.582
- We have the cult.

954
01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:44.281
We have the Bible
verse. a symbol.

955
01:03:47.017 --> 01:03:48.417
There must be something else.

956
01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.258
- The key.

957
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.961
But we don't have a fingerprint.
DNA. or a serial number.

958
01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.498
- There was a key that was
found at Abigail's home.

959
01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.494
Didn't fit any of her locks.

960
01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.762
- You check McGregor's?

961
01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:11.473
- What. with no warrant?

962
01:04:13.207 --> 01:04:14.608
- It's the American way.

963
01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:20.779
(upbeat rock music playing)

964
01:04:51.987 --> 01:04:54.384
- Right. it's time for
you to pay your bill.

965
01:04:55.655 --> 01:04:56.824
Did you hear me?

966
01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.349
I said. it's time for
you to pay your bill.

967
01:04:58.385 --> 01:05:02.024
- Why don't you fuck off?

968
01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:06.033
(upbeat rock music continues)

969
01:05:20.714 --> 01:05:24.143
(footsteps thudding)

970
01:05:24.178 --> 01:05:27.718
(door clattering)

971
01:05:27.753 --> 01:05:30.750
(McGregor retches)

972
01:05:39.692 --> 01:05:43.972
(car lock chirps)
(gravel crunching)

973
01:05:50.274 --> 01:05:53.542
(McGregor groans)
(ominous music)

974
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:58.954
(urine sloshing)

975
01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:03.024
(ominous music continues)

976
01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:06.926
- Do you get off watching
people trying to take a piss?

977
01:06:06.961 --> 01:06:11.065
(blows thudding)
(McGregor groaning)

978
01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:14.728
(McGregor coughs)

979
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.139
(ominous music continues)

980
01:06:27.175 --> 01:06:29.776
(phone buzzing)

981
01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:32.251
(Glen groans)

982
01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:42.360
(traffic whooshing)

983
01:06:46.326 --> 01:06:48.861
(birds chirping)

984
01:06:53.036 --> 01:06:55.703
(bag rustling)

985
01:06:57.777 --> 01:07:00.510
(ominous music)

986
01:07:08.787 --> 01:07:10.157
(door thuds)

987
01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:20.299
(ominous music continues)

988
01:07:24.969 --> 01:07:27.999
(lock clicks)

989
01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.319
(ominous music continues)

990
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:45.056
(phone rings)

991
01:07:45.091 --> 01:07:46.488
- Kessler.
- [Kessler]<i> Boyd?</i>

992
01:07:46.524 --> 01:07:47.991
- The key we found at
Abigail's fits a shed

993
01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:49.328
at the back of McGregor's.

994
01:07:49.497 --> 01:07:51.359
- [Kessler]<i> Wait for backup.</i>
- I'm going back to his place.

995
01:07:51.395 --> 01:07:52.661
- [Kessler]<i> That's an</i>
<i> order.</i>

996
01:08:02.602 --> 01:08:06.213
(ominous music continues)

997
01:08:11.345 --> 01:08:13.880
(door creaks)

998
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.267
(ominous music continues)

999
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:44.144
(footsteps thudding)

1000
01:08:44.179 --> 01:08:46.577
(door thuds)

1001
01:08:46.613 --> 01:08:50.224
(ominous music continues)

1002
01:08:52.386 --> 01:08:54.954
(lock clicks)

1003
01:09:16.753 --> 01:09:20.320
(ominous music continues)

1004
01:09:33.097 --> 01:09:35.830
(flies buzzing)

1005
01:09:38.334 --> 01:09:40.640
(footsteps clacking)

1006
01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.442
(flies buzzing)

1007
01:09:45.978 --> 01:09:48.216
(dramatic music)

1008
01:09:56.824 --> 01:09:59.557
(radio chatter)

1009
01:10:07.533 --> 01:10:09.899
- His car was found at
the bottom of the lane.

1010
01:10:10.469 --> 01:10:12.405
passenger's seat was
covered in blood.

1011
01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:15.707
Running DNA tests on the blood.

1012
01:10:16.643 --> 01:10:20.846
- [Dan] Question is. was he
dead or alive when he arrived?

1013
01:10:21.416 --> 01:10:24.010
- No forced entry.
I found him pinned to the wall.

1014
01:10:24.579 --> 01:10:26.515
Someone beat me to the pleasure.

1015
01:10:26.917 --> 01:10:31.282
- Yeah. showing his disgust
for those who come after him.

1016
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.493
- I mean. how do you
piss off a serial killer?

1017
01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:37.659
- By fucking up his master work.

1018
01:10:37.694 --> 01:10:41.627
(flies buzzing)
- Or by becoming a threat.

1019
01:10:41.663 --> 01:10:43.801
- Boss?
You need to see this.

1020
01:10:43.904 --> 01:10:46.934
(radios chatter)

1021
01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:54.472
We found a hidden
room through here.

1022
01:10:54.508 --> 01:10:56.541
(ominous music)

1023
01:10:56.577 --> 01:10:59.287
(footsteps clacking)

1024
01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:07.218
(ominous music continues)

1025
01:11:13.564 --> 01:11:16.397
- Look. he's had
this all planned out.

1026
01:11:16.733 --> 01:11:20.903
Future targets from
different faiths.

1027
01:11:20.938 --> 01:11:24.042
- Cleansing them from what
he considered false religion.

1028
01:11:24.611 --> 01:11:26.581
- [Glen]<i> Much more</i>
<i> methodical than we thought.</i>

1029
01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:28.081
<i> He was on his mission.</i>

1030
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.710
- Yeah. the problem
was we didn't know

1031
01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:33.686
where or when he would stop.

1032
01:11:34.055 --> 01:11:37.622
(ominous music continues)

1033
01:11:39.488 --> 01:11:41.054
- A notice from London.

1034
01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:44.398
Whoever told McGregor
of the killings.

1035
01:11:46.664 --> 01:11:48.666
he's opened something
up inside of him.

1036
01:11:50.837 --> 01:11:51.768
Wait.

1037
01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:53.803
There's Abigail.

1038
01:11:55.105 --> 01:11:56.069
Grace.

1039
01:11:57.804 --> 01:11:59.479
Why is there no photo of Marie?

1040
01:12:00.179 --> 01:12:01.481
- He didn't kill Marie.

1041
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:05.218
The first two murders
were different.

1042
01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.618
Marie's was a carbon
copy of the U.S. murders.

1043
01:12:08.653 --> 01:12:11.551
So whoever killed
her. killed McGregor.

1044
01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:13.452
- Why didn't you tell
me he didn't kill her?

1045
01:12:13.488 --> 01:12:14.929
- I wasn't sure.

1046
01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:19.697
but I did tell you not to
get too personal with him.

1047
01:12:22.829 --> 01:12:24.534
- Marie met your U.S. killer?

1048
01:12:24.869 --> 01:12:28.976
- Hey. you find your foreigner.
you have your justice.

1049
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:32.604
Starting with ATEM Security.

1050
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.477
(traffic whooshing)

1051
01:12:35.513 --> 01:12:40.652
(phone ringing)
(ominous music)

1052
01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:50.563
(ominous music continues)

1053
01:13:04.176 --> 01:13:05.809
(phone ringing)

1054
01:13:08.646 --> 01:13:10.480
- [Dan] Hey.
- [Walker]<i> Anything new?</i>

1055
01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.720
- You ever heard
of ATEM Security?

1056
01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:14.449
<i> - ATEM? No.</i>

1057
01:13:14.484 --> 01:13:16.521
I mean. I don't know.

1058
01:13:16.557 --> 01:13:18.519
You know. I deal with
so many. It's hard to...

1059
01:13:18.554 --> 01:13:20.351
- McGregor was murdered.

1060
01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:30.399
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. At the hotel.

1061
01:13:30.735 --> 01:13:32.737
- Stay there. I'm on my way.
Gimme 20.

1062
01:13:33.568 --> 01:13:36.334
(car whooshing)

1063
01:13:39.079 --> 01:13:41.680
(phone dings)

1064
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.215
(tense music)

1065
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:54.529
- Milano's of London.
Milano's of London.

1066
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.327
(tense music continues)

1067
01:13:58.363 --> 01:13:59.863
Milano's of London.

1068
01:14:04.736 --> 01:14:09.103
(tense music continues)
(car alarm chirps)

1069
01:14:13.147 --> 01:14:15.713
(phone buzzes)
- Boyd?

1070
01:14:15.748 --> 01:14:19.181
- Walker is the foreigner.
Lawson's in danger.

1071
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:21.448
He's meeting with
Walker right now.

1072
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:23.184
I'm headed to Lawson's hotel.

1073
01:14:23.586 --> 01:14:27.088
(tense music continues)

1074
01:14:34.563 --> 01:14:37.098
(door creaks)

1075
01:14:46.477 --> 01:14:48.807
(tense music continues)

1076
01:14:48.843 --> 01:14:52.520
(coffee machine burbling)

1077
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:05.656
(ominous music)
- Ah. you know him.

1078
01:15:05.692 --> 01:15:06.925
McGregor?

1079
01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:10.328
- Well. I've met most
security firms in the UK.

1080
01:15:10.364 --> 01:15:13.802
But at the convention.
you know. I don't even...

1081
01:15:13.837 --> 01:15:15.901
- Well. what do you
know about ATEM?

1082
01:15:15.936 --> 01:15:18.172
- I can make some inquiries.

1083
01:15:20.943 --> 01:15:22.676
- You know it wasn't
that long ago.

1084
01:15:23.011 --> 01:15:24.676
You sure you don't
remember this guy?

1085
01:15:24.712 --> 01:15:25.982
- No. I don't.

1086
01:15:26.715 --> 01:15:29.089
Before I started AA.

1087
01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:32.626
- Yeah.
(phone ringing)

1088
01:15:35.526 --> 01:15:37.656
- Come on! Come on!

1089
01:15:37.692 --> 01:15:40.392
(phone ringing)

1090
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:44.539
- Boyd. Wanna get that?
- Yeah. yeah.

1091
01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:49.467
Boyd. hey?
<i> - Walker is the foreigner.</i>

1092
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.609
Are you hearing me? Lawson?

1093
01:15:52.645 --> 01:15:55.275
<i> I repeat. Walker is the</i>
<i> killer!</i>

1094
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:57.618
- [Dan] Okay. good. So am
I gonna see you later on?

1095
01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:59.545
- [Glen]<i> Lawson. I repeat.</i>
<i> Walker is the killer!</i>

1096
01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.451
- Okay.

1097
01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.987
Sure thing.
(ominous music continues)

1098
01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:18.067
(jewelry clinking)

1099
01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:22.170
Do you remember these?

1100
01:16:28.777 --> 01:16:29.947
- The missing pieces.

1101
01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.445
- This was Sarah's.

1102
01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.624
- How did you get them?

1103
01:16:38.853 --> 01:16:41.255
- You gave it to her.

1104
01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:46.029
(ominous music continues)

1105
01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.235
- Whoa. Whoa.

1106
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:50.603
Dan. what are you doing?

1107
01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:54.842
- Did you really think
I would never find out?

1108
01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:58.675
You were my partner
for 18 years.

1109
01:16:58.711 --> 01:17:03.006
and you stole the
love of my life

1110
01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:04.652
and you killed her!

1111
01:17:05.619 --> 01:17:07.853
- What?
- She told me everything.

1112
01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.616
We argued.

1113
01:17:10.319 --> 01:17:15.061
She slipped. fell. and
died right in front of me.

1114
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.764
Something inside me clicked.

1115
01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:20.760
Does that pain you to hear?

1116
01:17:21.296 --> 01:17:26.434
I mean. not about Sarah.
but about what you did.

1117
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:32.108
- For what I did?
(ominous music continues)

1118
01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:37.449
I knew.
Yes. I knew it had to be you.

1119
01:17:37.484 --> 01:17:40.781
- I had to dispose of the torso.

1120
01:17:40.816 --> 01:17:41.884
- It was an accident.

1121
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.553
- If they found out
about the affair.

1122
01:17:44.588 --> 01:17:47.121
I would be blamed.

1123
01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:48.923
You know how that works!
(ominous music continues)

1124
01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:51.093
- But the body
parts. the symbol.

1125
01:17:51.128 --> 01:17:54.131
- Was an accident.
Just how they were laid out

1126
01:17:54.666 --> 01:17:56.636
- And you butchered the others?

1127
01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:59.770
- I had to erase the
stench of your sin.

1128
01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:02.433
- By murdering four
innocent people.

1129
01:18:02.468 --> 01:18:06.404
- Innocent? No. no.
They each played a part.

1130
01:18:06.439 --> 01:18:09.414
The receptionist who
checked you and Sarah

1131
01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:11.079
into the seedy hotel.

1132
01:18:11.114 --> 01:18:13.782
The girl who worked
at the jewelry store

1133
01:18:13.817 --> 01:18:15.580
that sold you the necklace.

1134
01:18:15.615 --> 01:18:19.257
The florist where you
bought the flowers for her.

1135
01:18:19.292 --> 01:18:20.519
The waiter.

1136
01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:23.926
You couldn't make the
connection. detective?

1137
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:25.692
- Why didn't you come for me?
- I did.

1138
01:18:25.728 --> 01:18:26.998
And here I am.

1139
01:18:29.569 --> 01:18:31.429
I could have taken you long ago.

1140
01:18:31.464 --> 01:18:35.303
but I rather enjoy
controlling your pain.

1141
01:18:37.038 --> 01:18:40.609
(ominous music continues)

1142
01:18:40.645 --> 01:18:41.978
- I tortured myself

1143
01:18:42.013 --> 01:18:44.175
because I couldn't
deliver them justice.

1144
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:47.348
- Well. justice is now served.

1145
01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:51.223
and it's delicious.

1146
01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:53.720
(dramatic music)

1147
01:18:53.755 --> 01:18:55.191
(gun fires)

1148
01:18:57.397 --> 01:19:00.064
(somber music)

1149
01:19:03.062 --> 01:19:05.872
(Walker panting)

1150
01:19:10.038 --> 01:19:12.038
- You're just like McGregor.

1151
01:19:12.073 --> 01:19:16.509
- McGregor was a piece of shit!

1152
01:19:17.577 --> 01:19:21.789
He murdered two girls
trying to copy my work.

1153
01:19:22.523 --> 01:19:24.355
Almost ruined everything.

1154
01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:27.824
(Walker gasping)

1155
01:19:28.026 --> 01:19:31.263
Oh. that's some dark
blood there. partner.

1156
01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.994
(Walker panting)

1157
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:34.802
Look like it might
be your liver.

1158
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.330
Press down on that.

1159
01:19:39.366 --> 01:19:41.668
Maybe you'll live
a little longer.

1160
01:19:41.704 --> 01:19:42.909
- Lawson!

1161
01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:47.375
Lawson!
- [Dan]<i> Room 28!</i>

1162
01:19:49.244 --> 01:19:51.010
(door thuds)
- You're under arrest!

1163
01:19:51.045 --> 01:19:55.121
(somber music continues)

1164
01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.180
- End him.

1165
01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:59.618
End him like he did
Sarah and Marie.

1166
01:20:02.622 --> 01:20:05.355
Marie's torso was the
only one we ever found.

1167
01:20:05.391 --> 01:20:09.001
The only one!
(tense music)

1168
01:20:10.736 --> 01:20:12.169
He's toying with you. Glen.

1169
01:20:13.398 --> 01:20:16.200
The same way he toyed with me.

1170
01:20:16.236 --> 01:20:18.637
He gutted Sarah and Marie.

1171
01:20:19.576 --> 01:20:20.237
End him!

1172
01:20:20.272 --> 01:20:21.574
- I was...
- End him!

1173
01:20:22.811 --> 01:20:24.016
- In love.

1174
01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.580
And there.

1175
01:20:29.953 --> 01:20:32.554
- What's that?
- And paid

1176
01:20:32.657 --> 01:20:35.522
(Walker panting)

1177
01:20:36.793 --> 01:20:38.555
for the necklace.

1178
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:43.695
(tense music continues)
(siren wailing)

1179
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.571
- This is Boyd.

1180
01:20:50.173 --> 01:20:52.838
Need a paramedic
urgently at the hotel.

1181
01:20:52.873 --> 01:20:54.442
Room 28.

1182
01:20:55.641 --> 01:20:58.751
Male. white. gunshot
wound to the abdomen.

1183
01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:02.648
Bleeding out.
(tense music continues)

1184
01:21:18.836 --> 01:21:22.074
(tense music continues)

1185
01:21:31.584 --> 01:21:34.350
(bottles clinking)

1186
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.987
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1187
01:21:40.022 --> 01:21:43.491
(tense music continues)

1188
01:21:55.938 --> 01:21:58.409
(phone ringing)

1189
01:21:58.444 --> 01:21:59.572
- Yeah.

1190
01:21:59.608 --> 01:22:01.643
- Do you mind coming back
upstairs for a moment?

1191
01:22:02.245 --> 01:22:04.047
Yeah. just talk me
through the scene.

1192
01:22:04.082 --> 01:22:06.112
Give me a statement.
- Oh. of course.

1193
01:22:06.615 --> 01:22:11.216
Yeah. I'll be right there.
(tense music continues)

1194
01:22:11.251 --> 01:22:13.851
(car tires squealing)

1195
01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.564
(tense music continues)

1196
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.200
(car engine roaring)

1197
01:22:23.197 --> 01:22:25.272
(dramatic rock music)

1198
01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:28.305
(siren wailing)

1199
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.973
(siren wails)
- It's Lawson.

1200
01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:39.415
Lawson is the original killer.

1201
01:22:45.225 --> 01:22:48.094
I'm heading east in pursuit
on Livingston Highway.

1202
01:22:54.168 --> 01:22:58.104
(dramatic rock music continues)
(tires squealing)

(siren wailing)

1207
01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:33.700
Suspect turning
left. left. left.

1208
01:23:35.169 --> 01:23:37.935
(siren wailing)

1209
01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.616

1235
01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.621
None of this had to
happen. you know?

We're just getting started.
(ominous music continues)

1239
01:26:23.603 --> 01:26:25.578
- You can't hide forever!

1240
01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:26.972
- And I won't.

1241
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:30.844
(guns roaring)

1242
01:26:35.318 --> 01:26:37.015
- [Glen]<i> Why did you do it?</i>

1243
01:26:40.554 --> 01:26:42.889
- I never meant to do any of it.

1244
01:26:43.864 --> 01:26:45.232
- You butchered my wife!

1245
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.927
- I set you free.

1246
01:26:49.898 --> 01:26:52.666
There's no coming back
from what she did to you.

1247
01:26:52.701 --> 01:26:54.464
(gun roaring)
- She was all I had left.

1248

(gun roaring)

1249
01:26:56.176 --> 01:26:58.641

(ominous music continues)
(Glen groaning)

1251

(gun roars)
(ears ringing)

1253

Six years and no one
ever found me out.

1254
01:27:22.797 --> 01:27:25.398
You know how you have
to put a dog down

1255
01:27:25.433 --> 01:27:27.098
after it's tasted blood?

1256

We cannot afford to spook him.
- Okay. I'll sort it.

1282
01:29:38.704 --> 01:29:41.764
(ominous music continues)
- Are all exits secure?

1283
