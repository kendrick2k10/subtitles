00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:39.580
- Come on.

10
00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:44.295
(praying in foreign language)

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.753
- Right there.

12
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.570
Right there.

13
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.403
- What?

14
00:00:58.883 --> 00:00:59.800
What is it?

15
00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:02.683
- It's--
- Answer me!

16
00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:03.516
- It's.

17
00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:04.598
- I. I hear it.

18
00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:05.459
- Watch out!

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.459
(eerie tense music)

20
00:01:13.264 --> 00:01:14.097
Take me.

21
00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:16.913
Just take me instead.

(eerie suspenseful music)

26
00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:31.215
- No.

27
00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:33.382
(panting)

28
00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:37.723
(eerie music)

29
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.710

(grunting)

31
00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.160
- I don't know.

32
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.187
Let's go find out.

33
00:03:50.444 --> 00:03:54.187
(knocking at door)

34
00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:56.348
- Who could that be?

35
00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:57.506
- Hi.

36
00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:58.383
- Hi.

37
00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.804
So glad you're here.

38
00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:00.637
- Me. too.

39
00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:01.470
Hi.

40
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.303
- Hello. Wendy.
- Hi. again.

41
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.803
Wow.

42
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.023
- Group hug.

43
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.983
Any hug?

44
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.960
Okay. they're too hold for that.

45
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.970
- Yeah. probably.

46
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.803
Uncle Donald.

47
00:04:16.803 --> 00:04:17.717
- Ah. I got ya.

48
00:04:17.717 --> 00:04:18.550
Ah. ah.

49
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.323
- Nice place.

50
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.253
- Thanks.

51
00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:23.086
You want to help us move some boxes?

52
00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:23.919
- Yeah. sure.

53
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.760
Jamie. where'd you go?

54
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.763
You gotta help out.

55
00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:30.583
- You know we'll never
get rid of them now?

56
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.033
- Does this work?

57
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.573
- No. not for a long time.

58
00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:45.086
- It's still cool.

59
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.740
- Hey. how are your videos going?

60
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.600
You still doing that?

61
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.900
- My show?

62
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.102
Yeah.

63
00:04:52.102 --> 00:04:53.823
- Did you catch a ghost yet?

64
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.753
- Nope.

65
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.040
- As long as you're having fun.

66
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.790
- I'll catch a real ghost.

67
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.260
Don't you worry.

68
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.220
- Sure you will.

69
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:06.530
But in the meantime.

70
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.863
could you help me get some
of those clothes upstairs?

71
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.960
- Only because you asked so nicely.

72
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.030
- Please.

73
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.193
I thank you.

74
00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:40.036
(door creaking)

75
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.943
- Hey.

76
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.470
What are you writing a novel?

77
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.960
- [Charlie] Almost there.

78
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.240
- Let me guess. this is for
a girl you're interested in?

79
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.570
- A girl. no.

80
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.720
- Oh you're writing to more
than one girl at a time. huh?

81
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.930
- They swipe right. I swipe right.

82
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.763
- What a world.

83
00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:17.570
It used to be dates. now it's swipes.

84
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.403
How do you keep track of that?

85
00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:20.390
I mean. if you're talking
to more than one girl

86
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.710
what happens if you send the wrong message

87
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.560
to the wrong one?

88
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.450
Yeah. okay.

89
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.330
Didn't think of that. did you?

90
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.550
Here. why don't you put
that there behind you

91
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.300
while you mull that over. hot shot.

92
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.480
So what's up. man?

93
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.043
- Nothing much.

94
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.200
- Listen. I was gonna surprise you

95
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.790
but I got the same system you have.

96
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.200
the new one. so you and I
can play online together.

97
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.300
It's pretty frigging sweet. right?

98
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.950
- Didn't know you played video games.

99
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.280
- Oh yeah. you could say I dabble.

100
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.833
- Right.

101
00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:56.083
(laughing)

102
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.383
- So. Charlie. listen.

103
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.410
I know things have been kind of different

104
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.603
for you and Jamie now.

105
00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:08.918
I mean. I miss my brother

106
00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:10.363
but for you guys. it's just.

107
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.820
All happened pretty quick.

108
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.270
Tough year for your mom. too.

109
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.090
Anyway. I know a little
a bit about the trouble

110
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.276
you had a few weeks back.

111
00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:25.109
- Look. I really don't want

112
00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:26.127
to do this right now.

113
00:07:26.127 --> 00:07:26.960
- I just. I just.

114
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.793
I just want you to know.

115
00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:29.910
I had a phase like that in my 20s. too.

116
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.440
I was angry at everyone and everything.

117
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.230
Yeah. I got into a lot of fights.

118
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.503
A lot.

119
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.463
I never won one fight.

120
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.557
Not even a single one.

121
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.330
Hey. did I ever tell you
about the pale blue dot?

122
00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:52.360
- Pale?

123
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.760
- Really?

124
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.920
I never.

125
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.960
Oh. well I gotta tell you now.

126
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.240
So. at the university. I got
all these students. right?

127
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.800
They're all stressing
out about their papers.

128
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.750
about their applications. their futures.

129
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.160
Like their whole lives.

130
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.527
Who they're gonna be.

131
00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:08.930
You know what I always tell 'em?

132
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.257
- What?

133
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:12.200
- I tell 'em one of my
all time favorite lessons.

134
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.660
It's the lesson that made me want

135
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.216
to study science in the first place.

136
00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:18.370
It's a lesson that my
science teacher taught me

137
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.570
about the pale blue dot.

138
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.920
So. basically the
concept is simple. right.

139
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.597
but it comes from one of
the greatest minds ever.

140
00:08:27.597 --> 00:08:30.870
The idea is. if you could see planet Earth

141
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.690
from far enough away.

142
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.030
you would see that it's
just this tiny speck

143
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.230
in a vast cosmic darkness.

144
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.863
It's just this tiny. pale blue dot.

145
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.783
That's it.

146
00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:44.310
Kinda makes you put things in perspective.

147
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.160
you know. I mean.

148
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.150
Think about everything
you know to be true.

149
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.420
who you are. your family.

150
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.190
How you could be better.

151
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.340
Maybe how your problems aren't as vast

152
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.790
as they might seem right now.

153
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.183
You know?

154
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.294
Anyway. you look it up.

155
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.100
Pale blue dot. you'll look it up?

156
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.030
Yeah. I mean it.

157
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.980
- No. I will.

158
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.010
- Oh. hey. I got something for you.

159
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.840
Your father's. now yours.

160
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.280
- No. way.

161
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.630
- Try it on.

162
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.880
- I didn't know you had this.

163
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.833
- Yeah. well.

164
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.680
I needed it but now I'm gonna pass it on.

165
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.100
- This is the jacket he had on

166
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.200
the first time we went riding.

167
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.283
I was scared. you know.
afraid I'd fall off the back.

168
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.886
He said if I just held on tight enough.

169
00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:46.326
I'd have nothing to fear.

170
00:09:46.326 --> 00:09:48.073
- Well now you got the
bike and the jacket.

171
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.770
Listen. don't forget I'm here

172
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.370
if you want to talk to me. okay?

173
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.940
For anything. that's what family's about.

174
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.773
That's here.

175
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.410
(banging)
(muffled shouting)

176
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.814
- What was that?

177
00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:04.731
(muffled shouting)

178
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.660
- Help. somebody.

179
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.493
- Jamie.

180
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:09.984
Are you okay?

181
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.060
- Yeah. I just.

182
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.910
I got locked in there.

183
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.107
I sort of freaked out.

184
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.790
- Jamie. honey.

185
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.623
There's...

186
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.973
There's no lock.

187
00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:25.915
- You know.

188
00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:26.748
- Sorry.

189
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.330
- It's okay.

190
00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:34.224
(engine revving)

191
00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:47.935
(engine revving)

192
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.833
Another box.

193
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.700
- Did you take what you want
from the pile in the cellar?

194
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.533
- What pile?

195
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:09.930
- The pile. the stuff. the boxes

196
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.790
that the last owners left.

197
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.660
- We're taking from that?

198
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.873
- Yeah. I got a lamp.

199
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.193
- I need a lamp.

200
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.270
- Everybody needs a lamp.

201
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.493
(shouts)

202
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.947
(tense suspenseful music)

203
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.423
- Oh and this triangle
symbol. it's recurring.

204
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.030
Whoever wrote this didn't
want to spell it out.

205
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.580
It's like it's written in code.

206
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.570
- Yeah or complete gibberish.

207
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.135
- Position matters.

208
00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:58.060
- Well yeah.

209
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.683
- Don't let it decide?

210
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.483
First is sight.

211
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.833
Second is hear.

212
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.783
Third is speak.

213
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.587
- You gonna eat that one?

214
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.759
- Yeah get close.

215
00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:28.373
close as possible.

216
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.303
Read incantation.

217
00:13:33.303 --> 00:13:35.553
(laughing)

218
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.980
Uh oh.

219
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.530
Would you believe some of
this is written in Latin?

220
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.603
Okay.

221
00:13:45.013 --> 00:13:46.653
- Would you believe I'm still hungry?

222
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.340
- Did you hear that?

223
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.840
- What?

224
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.110
- The.
(distant scratching)

225
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.280
Scratching.

226
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.799
- What?

227
00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.780
No. I don't hear anything.

228
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.923
- In the walls.

229
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.853
- Oh. come on.

230
00:14:02.853 --> 00:14:04.010
Don't tell me we have mice or something.

231
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.313
I gotta call somebody.

232
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.723
Wen?

233
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.980
Wen.

234
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.813
- Yeah?

235
00:14:16.813 --> 00:14:17.646
- You okay?

236
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.960
- Yeah.

237
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.340
- Okay.

238
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.300
You know what. I'm gonna go upstairs.

239
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.133
get ready for bed.

240
00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.263
Cool?

241
00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:26.513
- Cool.
- Cool.

242
00:14:49.864 --> 00:14:52.947
(objects clattering)

243
00:15:18.736 --> 00:15:23.348
(wood breaking)
(gasping)

244
00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:28.348
(wood breaking)
(objects clattering)

245
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.973
(eerie suspenseful music)

246
00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:54.618
(glass shattering)

247
00:15:54.618 --> 00:15:56.785
(gasping)

248
00:16:44.848 --> 00:16:47.431
(oil sizzling)

249
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.767
(panting)

250
00:18:32.297 --> 00:18:37.297
(eerie suspenseful music)
(pen scraping)

251
00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:02.600
(woman humming)

252
00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:17.475
(doorbell ringing)

253
00:19:17.475 --> 00:19:18.392
- I got it.

254
00:19:23.013 --> 00:19:23.960
Hey. Nancy.

255
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.793
- Hey.

256
00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:25.738
- Come on in.

257
00:19:25.738 --> 00:19:26.571
- Thanks.

258
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.543
- Wendy. Nancy's here.

259
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.533
Sorry.

260
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.480
- Nancy. you're a lifesaver.

261
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.290
- No problem at all.

262
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.123
- Nancy. good to see you

263
00:19:42.123 --> 00:19:42.956
but I need some more coffee.

264
00:19:42.956 --> 00:19:43.890
You want a cup?

265
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.930
- No. but I get it.

266
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.910
- Donuts. I made donuts.

267
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.500
- No. I'm good.

268
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.485
No thanks. though.

269
00:19:49.485 --> 00:19:50.890
- Wen?

270
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.233
Just eat 'em all myself.

271
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.180
- Yup. I married him.

272
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.730
- Yes.
- Weird. right?

273
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.853
- Oh.
- Come on. come on.

274
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.170
I tried working my way
through the Wednesday

275
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.250
and Thursday classes

276
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.810
but no dice.

277
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.643
- Don't worry.

278
00:20:15.643 --> 00:20:17.370
You must be so busy moving. anyway.

279
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.610
Let me grade 'em.

280
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.393
- Oh Nancy. I can't do that to you.

281
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.443
I just feel so.

282
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.570
I don't know.

283
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.520
You need to like. relax. you know.

284
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.330
hang out with your friends. whatever.

285
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.853
Be a 20 something.

286
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.470
I'm the boring old married one.

287
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.020
- Wen. trust me. I'm looking for something

288
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.340
to keep me busy right now.

289
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.890
Let me grade them.

290
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.200
- [Wendy] Are you okay?

291
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.033
- Yeah. why?

292
00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:48.940
- Are you sick?

293
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.470
- [Nancy] No.

294
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.200
- You love Donald's home made donuts.

295
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.050
- Yeah. I'm just watching my figure.

296
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:55.883
- Why?

297
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.493
- Brian and I. sort of. you know.

298
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.850
- Oh. sorry. honey.

299
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.050
But why would you need
to watch your figure?

300
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.680
- I think it was one of
the girls at the gym.

301
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.746
You know. one of the gym girls

302
00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:15.810
who takes a picture of herself

303
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.890
and posts it online.

304
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.520
every time she's working
out while she's working out.

305
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.930
when she's making herself a smoothie.

306
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.490
You know. the kind of girl you want

307
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.807
to hit with your car?

308
00:21:24.807 --> 00:21:26.567
(laugh)
- Wow.

309
00:21:26.567 --> 00:21:27.570
(laughing)

310
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.413
Wow.
- Yeah. yeah.

311
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.483
Yeah.

312
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.463
- Listen.

313
00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.880
The right person for you

314
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.310
will see that you're smart. kind.

315
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.540
and drop dead gorgeous

316
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.940
and they won't need a picture to prove it.

317
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.133
Screw Brian.

318
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.410
- This is why you rock

319
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.993
and also why I'm grading
these papers for you. Wen.

320
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.010
- You drive a hard bargain.

321
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.320
- Mm hmm.

322
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.320
Listen. I sort of walked here. you know.

323
00:22:00.423 --> 00:22:03.110
exercise. so.

324
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.460
- I'll give you a ride in.

325
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.510
- Thanks.
- Donald.

326
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.100
I'm heading out with Nancy.

327
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.270
- [Donald] Okay.

328
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.840
- Let's go.

329
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.673
- Okay.

330
00:22:40.263 --> 00:22:42.530
(object clattering)

331
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.363
- Hello?

332
00:22:53.865 --> 00:22:56.532
(door creaking)

333
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.853
Wen?

334
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.013
Wendy. I'm home.

335
00:23:22.724 --> 00:23:26.807
(whispering in foreign language)

336
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:33.743
Honey?

337
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.103
- Hi.
- Hi.

338
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.547
- When did you get here?

339
00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:43.413
- You okay?

340
00:23:45.897 --> 00:23:46.980
- I feel a little sick.

341
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.663
- Oh. what's going on?

342
00:23:49.598 --> 00:23:51.765
- I was gonna make dinner.

343
00:23:52.937 --> 00:23:53.770
- Oh.

344
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.130
Oh no. you got a fever.

345
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.203
Okay. wow.

346
00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.370
You know. let me run upstairs

347
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.570
and change real quick.
I'll come back down.

348
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:01.403
I'm gonna take care of you.

349
00:24:01.403 --> 00:24:02.714
Okay. just.

350
00:24:02.714 --> 00:24:03.547
- But I'm still gonna help with dinner.

351
00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:04.380
- No. no. no.

352
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.213
I'm cooking.

353
00:24:05.213 --> 00:24:06.046
Just.

354
00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:37.244
(meat sizzling)

355
00:25:08.242 --> 00:25:11.578
(eerie suspenseful music)

356
00:25:11.578 --> 00:25:16.578
(oil bubbling)
(eerie suspenseful music)

357
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.379
(gasping)

358
00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:20.629
(shouting)

359
00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:31.999
Okay.

360
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.423
Babe. come on.

361
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.040
Step up. step up.

362
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.873
Okay.

363
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:35.119
(shouting)

364
00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:36.090
(eerie tense music)

365
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.593
- I heard it in this house.

366
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.040
- Let's go back to the hospital.

367
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.890
- No. no. no. no.

368
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.753
Listen to me.

369
00:26:44.949 --> 00:26:46.163
I heard it.

370
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:49.362
Please.

371
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.590
- Sweetheart. you have
a really high fever.

372
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.003
You're just not yourself.

373
00:26:56.655 --> 00:26:57.488
- I promise you.

374
00:27:01.316 --> 00:27:02.149
It's here.

375
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:04.378
It's here.

376
00:27:04.378 --> 00:27:07.128
(heart pounding)

377
00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:10.288
Right behind you.

378
00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:15.092
In the dark.

379
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:20.092
(heart pounding)
(suspenseful music)

380
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.623
- Hey guys.

381
00:28:35.623 --> 00:28:37.770
It's Jamie. back for another video

382
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.600
at the world famous Blood Shed

383
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.460
where it was said that
three women were killed.

384
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.950
They say there was so
much blood on the inside.

385
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.130
it painted the walls red.

386
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.220
Creepy.

387
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.480
Now. last week we went
to the ghoul school.

388
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.020
that sucked. I know.

389
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.330
Nothing there.

390
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.653
But this time I'm hoping
we've got something real.

391
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.630
Okay. I'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.

392
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.080
Don't be scared of my device.

393
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.640
Right. so.

394
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.465
This is just an
electromagnetic field reader.

395
00:29:11.465 --> 00:29:13.790
so I can get a sense where you are

396
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.023
and talk to you.

397
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.440
And I'm recording you.

398
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.913
So. smile.

399
00:29:20.942 --> 00:29:22.290
Okay.

400
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.740
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

401
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.900
If the answer is yes.

402
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.990
take a step towards me

403
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.340
and my EMF will light up red

404
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.993
and if it's no step away.

405
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.679
Okay.

406
00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:36.346
(machine beeps)

407
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.363
Are you a girl?

408
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.033
Are you a boy?

409
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.093
Okay. um.

410
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.933
Let's try something different.

411
00:29:54.804 --> 00:29:56.693
Are you happy I found you?

412
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.643
Are you upset I found you?

413
00:30:02.643 --> 00:30:05.476
(machine beeping)

414
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.303
Okay.

415
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.973
Okay.

416
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.663
Am I bothering you?

417
00:30:17.628 --> 00:30:21.030
(machine beeping)

418
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.403
Do you want me to leave?

419
00:30:24.132 --> 00:30:27.030
(machine beeping)

420
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:27.863
No way.

421
00:30:31.671 --> 00:30:32.504
Proof.

422
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.370
(eerie suspenseful music)

423
00:31:24.028 --> 00:31:26.945
(doorbell ringing)

424
00:31:35.314 --> 00:31:38.462
(knocking at door)

425
00:31:38.462 --> 00:31:41.462
(suspenseful music)

426
00:31:49.802 --> 00:31:50.719
Aunt Wendy?

427
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.473
(phone vibrating)

428
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.613
- Hey. Jamie.

429
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.310
What. slow down.

430
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.610
What happened?

431
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.530
Why are you at my house?

432
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.363
Hang on.

433
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.643
What happened?

434
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.743
I'll be right there.

435
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.150
(eerie music)

436
00:33:00.898 --> 00:33:05.398
(groaning)
(panting)

437
00:33:24.396 --> 00:33:26.979
(storm raging)

438
00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:46.522
Sweetheart.

439
00:33:54.623 --> 00:33:55.730
What happened?

440
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.080
- At first she said one thing.

441
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.450
it was like she just
went completely blank.

442
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.903
She kept saying these two words to me.

443
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.773
Endless cruelties.

444
00:34:06.984 --> 00:34:09.399
And then...

445
00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:13.305
And then she seemed almost
like she couldn't breathe.

446
00:34:13.305 --> 00:34:15.880
then she just started screaming.

447
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.823
It will never end. it will never end.

448
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:22.290
- Let's get her back into bed.

449
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.123
- Uncle Donald.

450
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.137
What the hell is going on?

451
00:34:26.137 --> 00:34:27.387
- I don't know.

452
00:34:29.342 --> 00:34:30.425
I don't know.

453
00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:40.220
- I've heard of this before.

454
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.053
- What?

455
00:34:41.053 --> 00:34:43.053
- A ritual book like this.

456
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.182
Of course.

457
00:34:46.182 --> 00:34:48.100
It has to be done by a group of people

458
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.358
so the demon can't pray
on them individually.

459
00:34:50.358 --> 00:34:51.191
- Demon.

460
00:34:51.191 --> 00:34:52.024
- Individuals are weak.

461
00:34:52.024 --> 00:34:53.980
These forces can overwhelm a single person

462
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.863
but together.

463
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.670
Look. a triangle.

464
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.880
Three sense divided into three people.

465
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.710
One person to see. another person to hear.

466
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.870
and another person to speak.

467
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.000
- To do what?

468
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.540
- Whatever is attacking at Wendy.

469
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.102
it's been here for a long time.

470
00:35:08.102 --> 00:35:10.700
The people who lived here before you guys.

471
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.163
they were fighting it. too. with this.

472
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.350
Look. the ritual allows you to identify

473
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:20.090
the demon using these
abilities. okay. these senses.

474
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.740
The book itself gives you a
list of known incantations

475
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.180
to banish the demon.

476
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.160
- I've looked at all of this.

477
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.330
It's nonsense. it's just crazy scribbling.

478
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.910
- No. they're instructions.

479
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.480
- Jamie. you can't possibly believe

480
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.510
that any of this real.

481
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.846
- Of course I do.

482
00:35:33.846 --> 00:35:36.090
Don't you. after what's happened here?

483
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.310
I mean. what more do you need?

484
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.650
- The book is empty.

485
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.910
- No. it's here it's just hidden.

486
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.770
- That doesn't make any sense.

487
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.940
- It does.

488
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.120
This is powerful stuff.

489
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.930
it can be dangerous. too. I'm sure.

490
00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.530
- Never should have mentioned it.

491
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.973
- We have to do the ritual.

492
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.580
Me. you. and Charlie.

493
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.840
- No.

494
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.230
- Please let me do this for her.

495
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.260
- No.
- Uncle Donald.

496
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.953
- Absolutely not!

497
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.223
- Fine.

498
00:36:05.729 --> 00:36:08.340
But at least let me stay the night.

499
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.540
It would make me feel
better to be close by.

500
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.773
- Fine.

501
00:36:20.568 --> 00:36:23.485
(knocking at door)

502
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.483
- Hey.
- Hey. Charlie.

503
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.520
- Jamie seemed pretty upset on the phone.

504
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.473
You okay?

505
00:36:36.293 --> 00:36:37.430
Well. where is she?

506
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.780
- Fell asleep on the couch.

507
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.992
- She asked me for stuff.

508
00:36:41.992 --> 00:36:43.740
Got her clothes and a toothbrush.

509
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.573
- Good.

510
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.080
- Can I see Aunt Wendy?

511
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.663
- Sure.

512
00:36:57.533 --> 00:37:00.533
(eerie tense music)

513
00:37:11.556 --> 00:37:12.771
- What the hell?

514
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:15.190
What happened. what happened to her hand?

515
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.360
- It's kind of a long story.

516
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.700
- We gotta take her to
the hospital or something.

517
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.260
- I took her already. twice.

518
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.140
- And what did they say?

519
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.290
- It's not that simple.

520
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.623
- Did you tell mom?

521
00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:34.330
Look. I don't understand.

522
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.748
What's happening. what are
you not telling me here?

523
00:37:37.748 --> 00:37:41.248
(eerie suspenseful music)

524
00:38:01.423 --> 00:38:04.173
(speaking Latin)

525
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.977
(static crackling)

526
00:38:30.037 --> 00:38:32.954
(doorbell ringing)

527
00:38:39.347 --> 00:38:40.300
- Hi. Nancy.

528
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.133
You're here late.

529
00:38:41.133 --> 00:38:42.320
- Oh. I finished the grading.

530
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.870
I swear these kids
forget what the paper was

531
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.070
about halfway through.

532
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.280
(laughing)

533
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.483
- Listen. Wendy. she's.

534
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.470
She's kinda under the weather.

535
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:53.303
So. uh.

536
00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:54.670
- I don't want to be rude.

537
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.410
but I have to see her
about something here.

538
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.250
It will only take a minute.

539
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.093
- I don't know.

540
00:39:00.025 --> 00:39:00.858
- Hey.

541
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.963
- Hi.

542
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.570
- Charlie.
- Nancy.

543
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.740
- You work with my aunt?

544
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.330
- Yeah. a graduate assistant.

545
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.900
- Very cool.

546
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.680
You want me to take those for you?

547
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.523
- Yeah. sure.

548
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.610
- Like I said. she's not
going to be able to talk.

549
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.220
she's on some heavy pain medication.

550
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.630
- Oh. geeze. is she okay?

551
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.217
- No.
- Uh.

552
00:39:26.217 --> 00:39:28.133
- I mean. not really.

553
00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.700
- Is there anything I can do?

554
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.250
- No. I'm gonna stay
and help out where I can

555
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.893
but I think we're cool.

556
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.220
- That's nice of you.

557
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.640
- Okay. so thank you.

558
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.600
Have a great night. thanks.

559
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.433
Sorry about this

560
00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:46.920
and I'm sure that Wendy's really going

561
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.035
to appreciate all the hard work.

562
00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:51.411
- Oh. no problem. okay.

563
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:52.974
(gasping)

564
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:55.100
Um. what. what was that?

565
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.963
- I have no idea.

566
00:39:57.414 --> 00:40:02.414
- I got it.

567
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.023
Come on.

568
00:40:06.023 --> 00:40:07.830
What you got a security
system or something?

569
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:08.970
- No. we don't have.

570
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.870
- It's not locked. what's wrong with it?

571
00:40:14.693 --> 00:40:16.372
- It's stuck.

572
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:21.372
(glass cracking)
(power humming)

573
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.633
- Great.

574
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.510
- My phones dead and I
charged it. I know I did.

575
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.190
- Me. too.

576
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.650
- I was gonna use it for the phone light.

577
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:37.700
- Okay. that's weird.

578
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.620
- Uh. I'm gonna go check
the breaker. I guess.

579
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.720
- I'll check the back.

580
00:40:43.763 --> 00:40:44.763
- I'll come.

581
00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:54.537
- What's it looking like?

582
00:40:54.537 --> 00:40:56.787
All right here. let me try.

583
00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:03.594
Come on.

584
00:41:05.236 --> 00:41:06.403
What the hell?

585
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:10.804
Uh.

586
00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:13.568
Aunt Wendy?

587
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:18.274
(Eerie tense music)

588
00:41:18.274 --> 00:41:19.274
Is that you?

589
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.313
Hey.

590
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.803
- Get it open?

591
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.210
- Is there someone else in the house?

592
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.043
- What?

593
00:41:37.043 --> 00:41:37.933
No. it's just us.

594
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.230
- Hey.

595
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.530
So um...

596
00:41:47.609 --> 00:41:50.223
I have to tell you guys something.

597
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.800
- Why didn't you listen to me?

598
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.520
- I had to help her.

599
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.590
You didn't believe in it. so.

600
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.120
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

601
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.210
I just wanted to help her.

602
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.043
- All right. all right.

603
00:42:03.043 --> 00:42:04.150
Can somebody explain to me

604
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.790
what kind of weird shit is happening here?

605
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.523
- Yeah. yeah.

606
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.420
Your Aunt Wendy found
this book in the basement

607
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.950
and since then. weird
stuff has been happening.

608
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.223
- What's in the book?

609
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.670
- A ritual to banish demons.

610
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.430
You need three people to do it.

611
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.630
- Jamie believes that there's something

612
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.400
in the house with us.

613
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.610
- A demonic force.

614
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.473
- Yeah. that.

615
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.680
- I did the ritual.

616
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.880
I was trying to force you guys to do it

617
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.214
by starting it myself. I'm sorry.

618
00:42:35.214 --> 00:42:37.550
and Nancy I'm really sorry to you

619
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.790
because I didn't know you would

620
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.371
be coming over tonight.

621
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:41.204
- Okay. all right.

622
00:42:41.204 --> 00:42:42.798
So what do we need three people for?

623
00:42:42.798 --> 00:42:45.780
- The book needs you to identify the demon

624
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.800
before you can banish it

625
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.953
and in order to do that.

626
00:42:48.953 --> 00:42:51.543
you need to find the proper incantation.

627
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.800
There's three abilities
divided to three people.

628
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.750
One person to see the demon.

629
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.230
another person to hear the demon.

630
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.110
and another to speak the demon's language.

631
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.120
Show them the book. Uncle Donald.

632
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.100
- Here it is.

633
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.050
We still haven't figured it out. its...

634
00:43:09.341 --> 00:43:10.174
What?

635
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:13.660
- [Charlie] What?

636
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.293
- No. there's text there now.

637
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.360
In Latin and I can understand it

638
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.863
and I don't speak Latin.

639
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.080
How is this possible?

640
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.560
- It still looks empty to me.

641
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.393
- Me. too.

642
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.350
- That's mean you can speak the language.

643
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:36.350
So. either Charlie or I can hear

644
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.473
or see the demon.

645
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.340
- You don't know?

646
00:43:40.526 --> 00:43:43.193
(phone ringing)

647
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.733
- Nothing.

648
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.640
- Should we find a flashlight?

649
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.139
- Yeah. there in here.

650
00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:25.972
- I got 'em.

651
00:44:25.972 --> 00:44:27.055
- I'm coming.

652
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.790
- I know they're somewhere in here.

653
00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:52.903
Found one.

654
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.693
Look.

655
00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.163
Look. I know this is some weird shit.

656
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.990
But I'm really sorry you
got caught up in this.

657
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.090
- Let's just keep looking for flashlights.

658
00:45:26.818 --> 00:45:28.318
- You okay. Jamie?

659
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.410
- I have this terrible feeling.

660
00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:34.940
- What?

661
00:45:36.966 --> 00:45:39.216
- Like we're being watched.

662
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:47.680
I think somethings in here.

663
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:50.703
- In here?

664
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:54.133
Can you see it?

665
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.720
- I see something.

666
00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:06.970
(phone ringing)

667
00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:12.416
- I'm getting it this time.

668
00:46:15.726 --> 00:46:18.907
(ethereal screeching)

669
00:46:18.907 --> 00:46:21.740
(static cracking)

670
00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:27.405
(eerie suspenseful music)

671
00:46:29.467 --> 00:46:31.888
(panting)

672
00:46:31.888 --> 00:46:33.805
- Charlie. what was it?

673
00:46:35.805 --> 00:46:36.941
(object clattering)

674
00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:39.358
- That came from the kitchen.

675
00:46:42.726 --> 00:46:44.667
(high pitched whirring)

676
00:46:44.667 --> 00:46:45.889
(shushing)

677
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:49.222
(high pitched whirring)

678
00:46:51.665 --> 00:46:55.165
(eerie suspenseful music)

679
00:47:00.612 --> 00:47:02.184
What the hell?

680
00:47:02.184 --> 00:47:04.434
- What's going on. Charlie?

681
00:47:05.313 --> 00:47:06.606
- Did you guys hear that?

682
00:47:06.606 --> 00:47:08.166
- What?

683
00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:10.510
I don't hear anything.

684
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.080
- Neither do I.

685
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.280
- I think I'm hearing
things you guys can't.

686
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.613
- Where's Jamie?

687
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:26.903
- Jamie?

688
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.243
You okay?

689
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.233
- Right there.

690
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.163
Can you see that?

691
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.413
I can see.

692
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.400
I can see.

693
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.800
That means Charlie can hear.

694
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.343
- [Donald] What do you see?

695
00:47:50.049 --> 00:47:53.153
- Like a symbol.

696
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.850
- What kind of symbol?

697
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.343
(eerie tense music)

698
00:47:58.343 --> 00:47:59.453
- Maybe a warning.

699
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.513
It won't go away.

700
00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.093
I can see it everywhere.

701
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:10.043
- It's okay.

702
00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:11.846
- I can see it when I close my eyes.

703
00:48:11.846 --> 00:48:14.545
- It's okay. it's okay.

704
00:48:14.545 --> 00:48:15.378
Just sit down.

705
00:48:15.378 --> 00:48:16.262
It's okay.

706
00:48:16.262 --> 00:48:17.530
It's gonna be okay.

707
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.140
- [Nancy] Maybe she can
trace on a piece of paper?

708
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.830
- [Donald] That's a good idea.

709
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.153
Look on the shelf. see if there's a pen.

710
00:48:23.153 --> 00:48:24.990
You think you could recreate it?

711
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.990
- Yeah.

712
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:28.990
(eerie tense music)

713
00:50:11.428 --> 00:50:13.595
(panting)

714
00:50:14.708 --> 00:50:15.541
- Oh fuck.

715
00:50:16.505 --> 00:50:18.672
(panting)

716
00:51:36.315 --> 00:51:38.982
(wood creaking)

717
00:52:11.058 --> 00:52:14.575
(blood dripping)

718
00:52:14.575 --> 00:52:17.575
(eerie tense music)

719
00:52:25.155 --> 00:52:28.055
(muffled panting)

720
00:52:28.055 --> 00:52:31.055
(eerie tense music)

721
00:52:45.293 --> 00:52:47.460
(heaving)

722
00:52:49.615 --> 00:52:52.615
(eerie tense music)

723
00:53:00.592 --> 00:53:03.943
- What happened?

724
00:53:03.943 --> 00:53:05.284
Charlie. what happened?

725
00:53:05.284 --> 00:53:06.563
What happened to you?

726
00:53:09.226 --> 00:53:11.638
- You. you don't want to know.

727
00:53:11.638 --> 00:53:14.020
(objects thudding)

728
00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:14.853
Upstairs.

729
00:53:14.853 --> 00:53:16.040
- [Donald] Upstairs what?

730
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.250
- There's footsteps coming from upstairs.

731
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:21.460
- Wendy. we gotta go check on Wendy.

732
00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.293
Go. go.

733
00:53:23.476 --> 00:53:24.513
- Uncle Donald.

734
00:53:24.513 --> 00:53:27.203
That thing you said to me earlier.

735
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.193
the pale blue dot.

736
00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.213
Thank you.

737
00:53:31.213 --> 00:53:33.030
- Gonna be okay. Charlie.

738
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.863
Come on.

739
00:53:34.974 --> 00:53:37.141
(panting)

740
00:53:42.606 --> 00:53:43.439
- Stop.

741
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.120
I think there's something in there.

742
00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:51.767
(eerie music)

743
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.820
(static crackling)

744
00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.089
- Shit.

745
00:53:59.089 --> 00:54:00.491
- It's right there.

746
00:54:00.491 --> 00:54:01.333
- It's okay.

747
00:54:01.333 --> 00:54:02.303
It's okay.

748
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.490
- I don't hear it.

749
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:06.383
- I can't see it.

750
00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:09.610
Jamie. can you describe it?

751
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:10.443
What do you see?

752
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.263
- I don't know.

753
00:54:13.263 --> 00:54:14.096
- Just try.

754
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:19.113
- Thin long man in robes.

755
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:21.860
- [Donald] What else?

756
00:54:24.396 --> 00:54:26.640
- They're tattered robes.

757
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.041
Um just tall. very tall.

758
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:30.663
Like almost like a shadow.

759
00:54:32.278 --> 00:54:33.111
- Nothing.

760
00:54:35.845 --> 00:54:38.845
(eerie tense music)

761
00:55:04.237 --> 00:55:05.070
(screaming)

762
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.233
- Donald.

763
00:55:06.233 --> 00:55:07.780
Donald!

764
00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.613
Come on.

765
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.265
- Charlie. open the door.

766
00:55:12.265 --> 00:55:13.190
- Donald.
- Charlie.

767
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:14.483
- Donald!

768
00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:15.316
- All right.

769
00:55:15.316 --> 00:55:16.907
I'll find a way out.
- Jamie.

770
00:55:16.907 --> 00:55:17.984
Jamie.

771
00:55:17.984 --> 00:55:18.817
Jamie. come here.

772
00:55:18.817 --> 00:55:19.650
Look. I can't hear the sounds

773
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.483
and I can't see it.

774
00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:22.100
You gotta tell me where it is. all right?

775
00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.467
Please. just breathe through it.

776
00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:24.886
Breathe through.

777
00:55:24.886 --> 00:55:26.240
What do you see?

778
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.403
What do you see?

779
00:55:27.403 --> 00:55:29.903
(eerie music)

780
00:55:48.962 --> 00:55:49.962
- Oh my god.

781
00:55:52.096 --> 00:55:53.016
- Charlie!

782
00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:53.849
- Jamie.

783
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.040
(ethereal trilling)

784
00:55:59.848 --> 00:56:00.681
- Jamie!

785
00:56:00.681 --> 00:56:02.181
Jamie. I'm coming.

786
00:56:04.068 --> 00:56:05.471
(grunting)

787
00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:06.916
- No. no. no.

788
00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:08.257
I can't get it.

789
00:56:08.257 --> 00:56:09.254
- [Charlie] Go get Jamie.

790
00:56:09.254 --> 00:56:10.087
- Okay.

791
00:56:10.087 --> 00:56:10.920
- [Charlie] Just don't let her...

792
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.267
- I'm going to go get something.

793
00:56:12.267 --> 00:56:14.350
Okay. I got it. I got it.

794
00:56:24.307 --> 00:56:26.584
- Door. the door. come on.

795
00:56:26.584 --> 00:56:28.501
How do I open the door?

796
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.857
(gasping)

797
00:56:45.328 --> 00:56:47.578
(grunting)

798
00:56:50.384 --> 00:56:52.634
(grunting)

799
00:56:57.421 --> 00:57:02.421
(wet crunching)
(screaming)

800
00:57:03.224 --> 00:57:06.224
(eerie tense music)

801
00:57:20.615 --> 00:57:23.365
(drill whirring)

802
00:57:35.533 --> 00:57:40.260
(screaming)
(wet crunching)

803
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.093
- Charlie!

804
00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.260
(eerie tense music)

805
00:57:55.662 --> 00:57:56.579
Aunt Wendy?

806
00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:50.191
(door creaking)

807
00:58:57.276 --> 00:58:58.953
(shouting)
(tense music)

808
00:58:58.953 --> 00:59:00.118
(screaming)

809
00:59:00.118 --> 00:59:03.118
(muffled screaming)

810
00:59:04.651 --> 00:59:07.651
(eerie tense music)

811
00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:23.041
- Charlie.

812
00:59:24.162 --> 00:59:26.010
Oh. oh Jesus.

813
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:26.843
Come on.

814
00:59:26.843 --> 00:59:27.940
- My fucking shoulder hurts.

815
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.023
- Okay. okay.

816
00:59:30.753 --> 00:59:32.260
You get Jamie. get Jamie.

817
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.000
I'll get Nancy.
- Help.

818
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.833
Help me!
- Nancy.

819
00:59:36.103 --> 00:59:37.405
Nancy.
- Please help me!

820
00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:39.487
Please help me!

821
00:59:39.487 --> 00:59:40.767
(shouting)

822
00:59:40.767 --> 00:59:43.028
(screaming)
(wet crunching)

823
00:59:43.028 --> 00:59:44.031
- Okay. okay. it's okay.

824
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:45.385
It's okay.

825
00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:46.468
It's okay.

826
00:59:46.468 --> 00:59:48.047
It's gonna be okay.

827
00:59:48.047 --> 00:59:49.120
(sobbing)

828
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.960
I'm gonna get something
to stop the bleeding.

829
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.127
(sobbing)

830
00:59:57.463 --> 00:59:58.296
- Jamie.

831
01:00:10.354 --> 01:00:11.187
Jamie?

832
01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.028
Jamie.

833
01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:27.056
We're gonna get out of here. okay?

834
01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.723
We're gonna be okay.

835
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.690
The book says the candle will burn red

836
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:45.000
if Wendy's soul is taken.

837
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.310
- Do we know what the demon is yet?

838
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.410
- [Charlie] I know what it sounds like.

839
01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.620
- What?

840
01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.390
- [Charlie] I hear a low
pitched hum when it's near.

841
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.568
I know that.
- Okay.

842
01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:52.401
All right.
- But I don't

843
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:53.234
hear it every time.

844
01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:54.067
- [Donald] What do you mean?

845
01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.260
- [Charlie] I mean. it was right next

846
01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.790
to us upstairs and I didn't hear a thing.

847
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.100
- [Nancy] So it doesn't hum all the time?

848
01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:58.933
- [Charlie] Right.

849
01:00:58.933 --> 01:01:00.450
- Uh. a voice. a voice.

850
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.500
Maybe you don't hear it all the time

851
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.110
because sometimes it's a voice?

852
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.584
- What about what Jamie saw?

853
01:01:04.584 --> 01:01:07.980
- She said it was a
tall. thin man in robes.

854
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:08.984
- There's something like that here.

855
01:01:08.984 --> 01:01:12.380
Tall. tattered robes.

856
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.750
Low religious chant.

857
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.323
The name of the demon--

858
01:01:16.323 --> 01:01:18.216
(screaming)

859
01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.049
- Jamie!

860
01:01:19.049 --> 01:01:19.882
Jamie.

861
01:01:19.882 --> 01:01:21.144
(shouting)

862
01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:22.173
Jamie!

863
01:01:22.173 --> 01:01:24.540
(groaning)

864
01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.540
(eerie tense music)

865
01:01:28.757 --> 01:01:29.674
We can't leave him.

866
01:01:29.674 --> 01:01:31.190
- We need to worry about getting ourselves

867
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.590
out of here right now. okay?

868
01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:37.182
(distant booming thudding)

869
01:01:50.862 --> 01:01:53.362
(eerie music)

870
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.427
(wood creaking)

871
01:02:08.427 --> 01:02:13.427
(eerie music)
(booming thudding)

872
01:03:02.475 --> 01:03:07.475
(grunting)
(wet crunching)

873
01:03:11.956 --> 01:03:14.206
(gurgling)

874
01:03:33.579 --> 01:03:36.246
(door creaking)

875
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:51.743
- Donald?

876
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.823
Donald?

877
01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.373
Screw this.

878
01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:08.995
Hey. I gotcha ya.

879
01:04:09.922 --> 01:04:11.300
Hey. hey. hey.

880
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.133
It's okay. it's okay.

881
01:04:12.133 --> 01:04:12.966
We gotta keep pressure on it.

882
01:04:12.966 --> 01:04:14.084
We gotta keep pressure on it.

883
01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:15.204
It's fine. it's fine. it's okay.

884
01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:16.037
- Charlie. this--

885
01:04:16.037 --> 01:04:17.040
- You're gonna be fine.

886
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.300
- You have to use the book to banish it.

887
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.750
- What are you talking about?

888
01:04:21.097 --> 01:04:22.400
- Its name. I know its name.

889
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.060
- What. it doesn't matter.

890
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.082
It doesn't matter.

891
01:04:25.082 --> 01:04:27.505
- The name is Sullumeg.

892
01:04:27.505 --> 01:04:28.338
- What?

893
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.463
No. no. no.

894
01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:33.083
We need to keep pressure on it. stop.

895
01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:35.782
What are you doing?

896
01:04:35.782 --> 01:04:36.704
- Listen to me.

897
01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:38.497
Listen to me.

898
01:04:38.497 --> 01:04:40.520
You're gonna need all my blood to do it.

899
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.445
It won't work without it.

900
01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.610
(sobbing)

901
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.443
Charlie.

902
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:48.090
Hey. remember.

903
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:49.923
Hey. hey.

904
01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:51.663
Look at me.

905
01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.806
You remember about the pale blue dot?

906
01:04:57.363 --> 01:05:00.737
It's all. it's all just a vast darkness

907
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.523
and this is just one little speck.

908
01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:10.172
- Donald?

909
01:05:12.045 --> 01:05:12.878
Donald?

910
01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.421
Uncle Donald. Donald. Donald.

911
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:16.338
Look at me.

912
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:18.053
Please wake up.

913
01:05:21.288 --> 01:05:24.288
(eerie tense music)

914
01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:27.923
- It's okay. Jamie.

915
01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.624
It's okay. it's okay.

916
01:05:29.624 --> 01:05:31.791
(sobbing)

917
01:05:36.783 --> 01:05:40.283
(eerie suspenseful music)

918
01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:42.970
- I hear it.

919
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.120
Downstairs. we have to go now.

920
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.987
- What?
- He gave me his name.

921
01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:47.200
- What do we do?

922
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.050
- We do it again.

923
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.200
This time with you.

924
01:05:52.626 --> 01:05:55.126
(eerie music)

925
01:06:01.807 --> 01:06:02.640
Hurry!

926
01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.940
(speaking Latin)
Come on.

927
01:06:05.284 --> 01:06:08.034
(speaking Latin)

928
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:11.263
- I can read it.

929
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:12.943
I can read it.

930
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.800
- It's there.

931
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.508
- Charlie. watch out.

932
01:06:17.508 --> 01:06:22.508
(eerie music)
(electricity crackling)

933
01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:29.335
Charlie.

934
01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:30.811
Charlie.

935
01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:35.811
(eerie music)
(electricity crackling)

936
01:06:37.675 --> 01:06:38.694
Don't do it yet. Nancy.

937
01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.192
Wait until it gets closer.

938
01:06:40.192 --> 01:06:41.237
- What. what about Charlie?

939
01:06:41.237 --> 01:06:43.038
- We have and wait until it gets closer.

940
01:06:43.038 --> 01:06:44.037
- We have to do it.

941
01:06:44.037 --> 01:06:45.536
- Nancy. just wait.

942
01:06:45.536 --> 01:06:50.536
(eerie music)
(electricity crackling)

943
01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:00.680
Now. Nancy. do it now.

944
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:04.931
(speaking in Latin)

945
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:39.523
- Her fevers gone.

946
01:07:46.054 --> 01:07:47.613
- You're probably better off down here.

947
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.430
This whole fucking house
gives me the creeps.

948
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:56.530
- I hope she'll be okay.

949
01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.283
- Me. too.

950
01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:16.923
Yeah?

951
01:08:16.923 --> 01:08:17.947
- I'm sorry about Donald.

952
01:08:24.755 --> 01:08:26.930
What should we do with this?

953
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.050
- Burn it.

954
01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:28.883
- Sounds good.

955
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.690
I thought the effects of the ritual

956
01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:41.020
were supposed to wear off.

957
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:41.900
- [Charlie] I don't know.

958
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.733
Why?

959
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.945
- 'Cause I can still read it.

960
01:08:45.945 --> 01:08:46.778
- What?

961
01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:52.464
Gemullus.

962
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.163
We had it wrong.

963
01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:56.815
It's Gemullus.

964
01:08:56.815 --> 01:08:57.833
- What do you mean?

965
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.370
- The book. it gave us the word

966
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.150
but it was backwards.

967
01:09:03.150 --> 01:09:04.450
- [Charlie] What?

968
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:06.050
- It gave us Gemullus.

969
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:08.253
which means twin in Latin.

970
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:14.809
Um. it says some demons
come in identical pairs

971
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:17.240
and they are impossible to tell apart

972
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.343
based on looks on alone
and harder to banish.

973
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.970
It's saying the only way to distinguish

974
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:29.080
the two demons is by
the tone of their voice.

975
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.070
One demon has a low pitched voice.

976
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.903
the other has--

977
01:09:31.903 --> 01:09:32.736
- A pitched one.

978
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:36.180
- Yeah.

979
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.013
You heard that?

980
01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:37.846
You heard two demons?

981
01:09:37.846 --> 01:09:39.770
- I don't know. maybe.

982
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:42.640
- In order to banish two identical demons.

983
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.680
the same incantation
has to be read forward

984
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.010
and in reverse.

985
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.550
Or one of the demons will remain.

986
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.350
tethered to the world of the living.

987
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.543
One of them will be in our world forever.

988
01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.993
We did it wrong.

989
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.883
- Where's Jamie?

990
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.633
- You look down here.

991
01:10:08.633 --> 01:10:09.780
I'll look upstairs.
- Jamie!

992
01:10:10.857 --> 01:10:11.690
Jamie!

993
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.273
Jamie.

994
01:10:19.135 --> 01:10:22.687
(distant screaming)

995
01:10:22.687 --> 01:10:25.020
(screaming)

996
01:10:28.782 --> 01:10:33.782
(wet crunching)
(eerie tense music)

997
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:41.923
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

998
01:10:41.923 --> 01:10:46.923
(wet crunching)
(eerie tense music)

999
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:53.840
Jamie.

1000
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.673
Jamie!

1001
01:10:56.323 --> 01:10:57.593
What the fuck did you do?

1002
01:11:00.982 --> 01:11:01.815
Huh?

1003
01:11:01.815 --> 01:11:03.898
What the fuck did you do?

1004
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.545
- Jamie?

1005
01:11:42.545 --> 01:11:46.045
(eerie suspenseful music)

1006
01:12:30.776 --> 01:12:34.276
(eerie suspenseful music)

1007
01:13:15.898 --> 01:13:18.898
(eerie tense music)

1008
01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:23.102
(eerie tense music)

1009
01:15:24.652 --> 01:15:27.652
(eerie tense music)

1010
01:16:43.329 --> 01:16:45.829
(tense music)
