I grew old with OGs

5
00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:00.327
Just enough time for
me to get on my feet

6
00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:02.024
and find a place of our own.

7
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.245

You can stay here

We can't even have a
decent conversation.

14
00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:26.004
- Listen. my cup is overflowing
and not in a good way.

15
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:27.179
I've had to change jobs

16
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.661
and this one isn't
paying like the old one.

17
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:33.403

- Are you accusing
me of using drugs?

27
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.214
- If not. then why so defensive?

28
00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:06.958

When I'm alone in my room.

Sometimes I stare at the wall

147
00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:00.551
and in the back of my mind
I hear my conscience call

148
00:15:00.682 --> 00:15:02.597
telling me I need a girl.

149
00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:03.598

Actually. where's the rest room.

00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:26.496

182
00:18:38.508 --> 00:18:41.468
- Hello.

183
00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:44.558
- Hey. why are you whispering?

184
00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:46.734
- Listen. look. I'm on a date.

185
00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:49.345
- Okay. I feel you girl.

186
00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:50.825
So what you calling me for?

187
00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:54.785
- Listen. I thought
about what you said

188
00:18:54.872 --> 00:18:55.917
about me pushing guys away.

189
00:18:57.397 --> 00:18:58.833
And I don't wanna
do that anymore.

190
00:18:58.963 --> 00:19:00.574
Like this guy he's really nice.

191
00:19:00.704 --> 00:19:02.793
And he went all out
of his way from me.

192
00:19:02.924 --> 00:19:06.493
- Oh. that's sweet.

193
00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:08.234
Have you been drinking?

194
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.062
- No.
- Okay. Good.

195
00:19:13.717 --> 00:19:16.590
Cause you know how you get
once you've been drinking.

196
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.331
- What is that supposed to mean?

197
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:20.637
- It means you are lightweight

198
00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:22.465
and you don't know how
to hold your liquor

199
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:25.207
and then you start-
- Start what?

200
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:28.167
- Start being really aggressive.

201
00:19:28.297 --> 00:19:28.950
- I do not.

202
00:19:31.126 --> 00:19:33.302

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.338
But since we're

let me take you out again?

353
00:30:26.781 --> 00:30:27.434
- I'm not letting
you take me out.

354
00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:28.348
- Huh?

355
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.786
- I'm gonna take you out.

356
00:30:35.746 --> 00:30:38.445
I would like that.
I really would.

357
00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:39.402
- Me too.

358
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:21.923
- All right. so if you all
want something in this life.

359
00:31:22.054 --> 00:31:24.317
it's up to you all
to go out and get it.

360
00:31:24.447 --> 00:31:26.623
So I need to hear everybody
in here repeat after me.

361
00:31:26.754 --> 00:31:28.974
If it is to be. it is up to me.

362
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.935
- If it is
to be it's up to me.

363
00:31:34.066 --> 00:31:38.331
- If it is to be.
it is up to me.

364
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:41.508
- If it is to
be. it is up to me.

365
00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:46.165
- Right. so if you all
don't put in the work.

366
00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:48.297
don't look for the rewards.

367
00:31:48.428 --> 00:31:50.691
- Mr. Joe. why you
so hard on this?

368
00:31:50.778 --> 00:31:53.650
- Because I love y'all.

369
00:31:53.737 --> 00:31:55.565
- Is it true you
used to be police?

370
00:31:55.696 --> 00:31:56.958
- Yes. that's true.

371
00:31:58.612 --> 00:32:01.223
- You still cool with them?

372
00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:03.486
- Yes. I'm still close
with a few officers.

373
00:32:03.617 --> 00:32:05.532
- Were you a dirty cop?

374
00:32:05.662 --> 00:32:07.142
- What?

375
00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:09.971
- See I was watching
48 hours last night

376
00:32:10.102 --> 00:32:11.799
and mane police dirty.

377
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.062
They gave everybody a box
of chicken and guess what?

378
00:32:14.193 --> 00:32:15.324
- What Rashad?

379
00:32:16.543 --> 00:32:17.761
- They all snitched.

380
00:32:17.892 --> 00:32:19.807
They put truth serium
in that chicken.

381
00:32:23.332 --> 00:32:24.116
- Dismissed.

382
00:32:35.692 --> 00:32:38.739
I want to sign up
for this program.

383
00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:40.088
- What's your name though. man.

384
00:32:40.219 --> 00:32:41.829
- Quincy.

385
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.832
Ain't never seen you before.
you live around here.

386
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:47.008
- Me and my mom just moved
here with my auntie Gwen.

387
00:32:47.139 --> 00:32:49.706
- Gwen Saulsberry?
- Yeah.

388
00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:52.927
- I can see a resemblance.

389
00:32:53.058 --> 00:32:56.800
- I was wondering. do you guys
have any photography classes?

390
00:32:58.019 --> 00:32:58.802
- Nah. man.

391
00:32:58.933 --> 00:33:00.587
Unfortunately we don't.

392
00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:02.415
Everything around here is pretty
much at a grassroots level.

393
00:33:02.545 --> 00:33:04.939
the community and
the neighbors chip in

394
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.419
to make sure we have
bare necessities

395
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:08.160
and everything that we need.

396
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.770
But why you ask?

397
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.120
You a photographer or something?

398
00:33:13.513 --> 00:33:14.644
- A little bit.

399
00:33:15.645 --> 00:33:15.863
- Okay. Okay.

400
00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:22.565
Walk with me.

401
00:33:22.652 --> 00:33:26.134
Well. this community center
was built for us by us.

402
00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:27.831
So we try to do
things for the kids.

403
00:33:27.962 --> 00:33:29.398
like afterschool programs.
bake sales. sock donations.

404
00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:31.226
and help with schooling.

405
00:33:32.662 --> 00:33:34.664
- I can get a summer job.

406
00:33:34.751 --> 00:33:38.538
- Well. a job technically
means you get paid to do that.

407
00:33:38.668 --> 00:33:40.627
Everybody around here
volunteers their time

408
00:33:40.757 --> 00:33:42.150
and their resources.

409
00:33:42.281 --> 00:33:44.109
We all grew up in
this neighborhood.

410
00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:47.112
Or either went to the high
schools around the corner.

411
00:33:47.242 --> 00:33:47.895
- Gotcha

412
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:52.073
- You know what man
I tell you what.

413
00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:54.815
if you need help with schooling.

414
00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:57.513
something to eat or
access to computers.

415
00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:00.690
All right. we got you.

416
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:01.604
This is a safe haven.

417
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:04.607
We all we got.

418
00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:12.746
- Lemme go bruh.

419
00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:14.182
- Hey. hold on.

420
00:34:14.269 --> 00:34:15.053
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

421
00:34:15.183 --> 00:34:15.836
What is going on out here?

422
00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:16.706
Hold on. Hold on.

423
00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:17.751
What is this?

424
00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:18.926
- Weedie took my money.

425
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:19.709
- Mane. know I didn't.

426
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.710
- Yes you did.

427
00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:22.364
- Weedie. what are you doing?

428
00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:24.105
You ain't even
supposed to be up here.

429
00:34:24.236 --> 00:34:25.411
Let'em. let him go guys.

430
00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:28.805
- Get y'all hands off of pimp.

431
00:34:28.892 --> 00:34:30.851
Mr. Joe. you gonna kick me
out the program like that?

432
00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:32.679
- Weedie I told you. once
you got yourself together.

433
00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:33.680
you were welcome
to come back here.

434
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.552
You have not done your part.

435
00:34:36.683 --> 00:34:39.686
So you kicked yourself
out the program.

436
00:34:41.383 --> 00:34:43.864
- Mane. forget y'all.
bunch of sissies up anyway.

437
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:00.750
- Look I'm sorry about that.

438
00:35:00.881 --> 00:35:02.143
- You know him?

439
00:35:03.623 --> 00:35:04.232
- No.

440
00:35:08.758 --> 00:35:12.675
- Well. look. if you
need anything. hit me up.

441
00:35:12.806 --> 00:35:13.720
All right.

442
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:14.851
We all we got.

443
00:35:25.253 --> 00:35:26.776
- Hey.

444
00:35:26.907 --> 00:35:29.083
- Hey. if it isn't
stay out all night.

445
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:30.171
- Don't start.

446
00:35:31.738 --> 00:35:34.306
- So I guess it went
better than expected.

447
00:35:34.436 --> 00:35:35.959
- It's complicated.

448
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.918
But I'll tell you
about it one day.

449
00:35:38.048 --> 00:35:38.875
- It's okay.

450
00:35:47.057 --> 00:35:47.884
- You've been staring
at those stars

451
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:48.624
since we were little.

452
00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:48.972
- It's peaceful.

453
00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.545
Do you remember that time
when I fell out the tree

454
00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:59.722
and broke my arm and we
tried to hide it from mama?

455
00:35:59.853 --> 00:36:01.159
- Yes.

456
00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:02.682
And it was your night
to wash the dishes

457
00:36:02.812 --> 00:36:03.770
and she was wondering why
the hell I was helping you.

458
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.467
- Right?

459
00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:07.165
- How could I forget?

460
00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:10.559
- We had some good
times though. did we?

461
00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:19.438
- Charlene. I'm sorry.

462
00:36:21.396 --> 00:36:22.180
- For what?

463
00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:26.880
- For always being the
nagging little sister.

464
00:36:26.967 --> 00:36:28.316
always up under you.

465
00:36:30.144 --> 00:36:31.711
I could have been more
understanding. you know.

466
00:36:31.841 --> 00:36:33.887
I could have helped out more.

467
00:36:35.584 --> 00:36:38.674
but I was somewhere
trying to be grown.

468
00:36:38.805 --> 00:36:39.849
- Yes you were.

469
00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:44.202
But it's okay.

470
00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:45.551
- With you and Quincy here.

471
00:36:45.638 --> 00:36:48.423
I feel like I got
my family back.

472
00:36:48.554 --> 00:36:50.686
I feel like I get a
second chance at life.

473
00:36:50.817 --> 00:36:53.298
and I just don't
wanna mess it up.

474
00:36:54.777 --> 00:36:56.301
- You won't.

475
00:36:56.388 --> 00:36:58.520
Just keep doing what you're
doing and stay focused.

476
00:36:58.607 --> 00:36:59.260
- Right.

477
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:04.918
I love you sister.

478
00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:06.136
I love you too.

479
00:40:15.848 --> 00:40:17.415
- What's up Smoke.

480
00:40:17.545 --> 00:40:19.373
I know you didn't call me
here to watch you drink.

481
00:40:19.504 --> 00:40:20.200
- You a smart man.

482
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.117
That's why I like you.

483
00:40:24.247 --> 00:40:26.424
So I came up with the plan
for us to make three times

484
00:40:26.554 --> 00:40:28.382
the amount of money
off dance battle.

485
00:40:28.513 --> 00:40:29.905
- All right. cool.

486
00:40:31.341 --> 00:40:32.778
- Y'all are gonna
throw the battle.

487
00:40:32.908 --> 00:40:33.779
- Say what?

488
00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:35.041
- You and the Jookin Kangz

489
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:38.436
are going to lose the
battle on purpose.

490
00:40:39.915 --> 00:40:41.656
So I'm watching
the best come here

491
00:40:41.787 --> 00:40:45.834
and everybody's got you
winning by a landslide.

492
00:40:45.965 --> 00:40:49.359
Meaning I'm going have
to pay out from 25K.

493
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.233
When you and the crew lose.
I get to keep all that money.

494
00:40:53.363 --> 00:40:55.061
Now I'll give the crew
a few hundred dollars

495
00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:57.759
and line your
pockets up real nice.

496
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:02.372
- They ain't going
be down for that.

497
00:41:02.503 --> 00:41:06.464
- They not gonna know. now
they can't win without you.

498
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:10.903
Now you gone lose the battle.

499
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.166
get sick. sprain your ankle.

500
00:41:13.253 --> 00:41:14.602
Hell I don't care.

501
00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:18.693
- I can't do that Smoke.

502
00:41:20.434 --> 00:41:24.699
I've been practicing like every
day. sometimes. twice a day.

503
00:41:32.664 --> 00:41:34.883
- You still trying to
get that money to go?

504
00:41:35.014 --> 00:41:36.406
- Whatcha talking about mane?

505
00:41:36.537 --> 00:41:38.931
- Come on Young.
save that for me.

506
00:41:39.061 --> 00:41:41.542
You think I don't know what's
going on in your world. huh?

507
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:46.416
So this how it's gonna go down.

508
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:50.072
Y'all are going to lose the
battle because if you don't.

509
00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:51.552
I'm gonna send my crew

510
00:41:51.683 --> 00:41:52.901
to your little girlfriend's
apartment complex

511
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:55.208
and tell them to clean it out.

512
00:41:55.338 --> 00:41:57.732
Then I'm gonna kill you.

513
00:42:22.452 --> 00:42:25.804
- Bingo.

514
00:42:36.466 --> 00:42:37.250

00:43:04.669 --> 00:43:06.409
- I found out when she
was 15. she was pregnant.

529
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.761
And her mama shipped her and
her sister in Mississippi.

530
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:11.110

had no kid though.

But then she talking. her
mama went back up there.

Got her. made her finish school

534
00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:26.212
and then had her older sister
take care of the little kid.

535
00:43:26.342 --> 00:43:27.169
- For real?

536
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.693

00:43:28.823 --> 00:43:31.130
So where the little boy at?

00:43:34.133 --> 00:43:34.786
- Ah. they messed up. mane.

You were sitting there like you

00:45:38.518 --> 00:45:39.954
You don't remember.

576
00:45:54.055 --> 00:45:55.622
- That's my sister.
- Oh. I get it.

577
00:45:59.017 --> 00:46:01.933
Went to the same
elementary type sister.

me to voicemail

583
00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:18.253

I ain't never told
another woman.

589
00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:36.228
You have the decency
to sit me down

590
00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:37.533
and talk to me like an adult.

591
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:41.189
- Charles. I just didn't know.

592
00:46:41.276 --> 00:46:42.364
and I told you now
that I'm sorry.

593
00:47:00.034 --> 00:47:00.774
What's wrong with you?

594
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:02.297

00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:15.310
- Is it true that
auntie Gwen is my momma?

601
00:47:15.441 --> 00:47:16.485
- Who told you that?

602
00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:17.443
- It doesn't matter.

603
00:47:17.573 --> 00:47:18.792
- Quincy baby. Listen. stop.

604
00:47:18.923 --> 00:47:20.489
Listen.

605
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.229
- Hey. you can't be
believing what people say.

606
00:47:22.491 --> 00:47:24.319
People lie. people say stuff.

607
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.713
- Yes. Yes. baby.

608
00:47:28.497 --> 00:47:30.848
It's true.

609
00:47:30.978 --> 00:47:33.285
Quincy. I was gonna tell
you when the time was right.

610
00:47:33.415 --> 00:47:34.634
but with the move
and everything. that
time just never came.

611
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.768
- So you been lying
to me my whole life?

612
00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:40.161
- It's not like that.
- And I was only 15.

613
00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:42.555
- Yeah. I know you was
only 15 and grandma-

614
00:47:42.685 --> 00:47:43.512
- That's not the whole story.

615
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:44.992
- Listen. Quincy.

616
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:46.646
Let's just talk about
it. let's sit down.

617
00:47:46.776 --> 00:47:48.517
Let's talk about it. Quincy.

618
00:47:49.736 --> 00:47:52.173
- My whole life been a joke.

619
00:47:52.304 --> 00:47:53.740
- No.
- It's not like that. baby.

620
00:47:53.827 --> 00:47:56.699
- But it won't be
a joke no more.

621
00:47:56.786 --> 00:47:57.439
- Quin baby don't leave.

622
00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.006
Don't leave. I'm sorry.

623
00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:01.095
- Gwen. let him go.

624
00:48:01.226 --> 00:48:01.704
Just let him go. Gwen.

625
00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:08.233
You've been running
your mouth. haven't you?

626
00:48:08.363 --> 00:48:09.712
- What?

627
00:48:09.843 --> 00:48:11.105
- You heard me. 'cause
that's what junkies do.

628
00:48:11.192 --> 00:48:12.324
- I haven't said anything.

629
00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:12.977
- You're lying.

630
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.329
I knew something like
this would happen

631
00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:20.114
because you've never
been nothing but
trouble all your life.

632
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:22.377
But what they say.
"Take care of Gwen.

633
00:48:22.508 --> 00:48:23.683
She's your little sister.

634
00:48:23.813 --> 00:48:25.598
You're more mature than her."

635
00:48:25.685 --> 00:48:26.381
Charlene.

636
00:48:26.512 --> 00:48:27.382
I'm tired.

637
00:48:28.731 --> 00:48:30.081
Just leave me alone.

638
00:48:30.211 --> 00:48:33.562
Leave me alone.

639
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:38.480

Dearest Quincy.

I've never knew love

675
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:41.930
held you. kissed you.

676
00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:55.901
And because of that love.
I had to let you go.

677
00:54:56.031 --> 00:55:00.209
Let you be with someone I
trusted with all of my being.

678
00:55:00.384 --> 00:55:03.169
my sister Charlene.

679
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.128
I made decisions that could
only destroy your life

680
00:55:06.259 --> 00:55:09.044
as they were beginning
to destroy mine.

681
00:55:11.699 --> 00:55:13.266
Know that your mother
wanted to tell you.

682
00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:14.136
but I was never ready.

683
00:55:16.443 --> 00:55:19.141
Cause all the guilt.
the hurt and the pain.

684
00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:21.796
I didn't need more
add to my life.

685
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.372
It was selfish. but
I just couldn't.

686
00:55:36.115 --> 00:55:37.290
When you found out. it
was a nightmare come true.

687
00:55:39.118 --> 00:55:39.858
I'm sorry.

688
00:55:39.988 --> 00:55:41.338
I'm so sorry. Quinn.

689
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.912
The weight of you knowing

690
00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:53.524
was just too heavy
for me to bear.

691
00:55:55.134 --> 00:55:58.050
Remember your mother.
Charlene loves you

692
00:56:03.011 --> 00:56:04.578
So please be good for her.

693
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:09.104
I will always love
you. love aunt Gwen.

694
00:56:12.847 --> 00:56:13.848
- So what's up.

695
00:58:53.747 --> 00:58:54.922
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

696
00:58:55.053 --> 00:58:57.098
- It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

697
00:58:57.229 --> 00:58:58.404
- Now I'm an
accessory to robbery

698
00:58:58.535 --> 00:58:59.710
- You weren't
supposed to be there

699
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.582
- I should have
made that decision.

700
00:59:02.669 --> 00:59:04.541
You could have gotten us killed.

701
00:59:04.671 --> 00:59:07.152
- I needed the bread.

702
00:59:07.282 --> 00:59:08.196
- I could have
died. and for what?

703
00:59:08.283 --> 00:59:08.327
Some bullshit?
