00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.808
[traffic din]

4
00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.638
[Alex]
When I was very young.

5
00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:32.249
Sometimes I'’d lay
in bed at night...

6
00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:35.209
and imagined that my family
turned into monsters

7
00:00:35.383 --> 00:00:37.863
when I fell asleep.

8
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.996
Listening to the hum
of urban traffic

9
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.867
outside my window.

10
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.435
I could picture them
having wild revelries.

11
00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.135
sure to explode
my 8-year-old mind.

12
00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.615
And. of course. there was
a thoroughly logical belief

13
00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.618
that they were fattening me up
just to eat me.

14
00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:57.144
Even now.
at the ripe old age of 16.

15
00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:59.798
I still catch myself
asking the same old question.

16
00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:02.714
Who are you people?

17
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.289
And lately.
rather than recede.

18
00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:14.639
that question
only gets louder.

19
00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:16.685
Consider my father.

20
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.209
He's a shark litigator.
who simultaneously craves

21
00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:21.820
both the nobility of laboring
for the disenfranchised

22
00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:24.432
and the splatter of blood
from those who dare oppose him.

23
00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:27.217
Perhaps that's why

24
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:28.784
his emotional
communication switch

25
00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.090
is permanently stuck
on "yell."

26
00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:31.569
Alex. come on.

27
00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:32.440
You're going to
be late for school.

28
00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:34.268
Jesus H. Christ.

29
00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:36.052
[Alex] Especially
when reminded that

30
00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:39.186
his 16 year old daughter
actually looks 16.

31
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.057
[Carey] Does no one
wear clothes anymore?

32
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.928
[sighs]

33
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.497
[Alex] My mother.
meanwhile. enjoys smiling.

34
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.718
She works in PR.
which is by its very nature.

35
00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:52.286
the most superficial
of superficial professions.

36
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.984
Still.

37
00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:56.768
-it plays to her strength.
-Good to see you.

38
00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:59.075
[Alex] Switching
from externalized jubilation

39
00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:00.816
to world class detachment.

40
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.644
Judith Fixel.

41
00:02:02.818 --> 00:02:04.385
[Alex] Publicly.
there's a direct correlation

42
00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:06.126
between said detachment

43
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.431
and dead eyed
Cheshire cat grinning.

44
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:12.436
Privately. that detachment
takes a different form.

45
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.830
[Judith] Yeah. Carey and I
are taking the girls

46
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:16.266
to visit his mother.

47
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:19.095
Oh. yes.
A joy it shall be.

48
00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.402
But when we get back.
let's make a night of it.

49
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.056
Okay. Okay. Bye.

50
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:25.536
[Alex] Not a monster'’s roar.

51
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.451
Do you have
to do this right here?

52
00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:29.410
You're going to ruin
my floors.

53
00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.673
[Alex] Something quieter.

54
00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:33.457
What do you think
of the painting?

55
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.329
A reminder
that when she's around me.

56
00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:36.504
she's never quite there.

57
00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:38.114
Your principal called.

58
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.203
You're failing
pre-calculus.

59
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.209
[Alex] She loves
my sisters. though.

60
00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.603
Their existence is basically
a family creation myth.

61
00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:50.735
Daddy.
tell the story again.

62
00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.391
Uh. Mommy and I wanted to
have more babies.

63
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:56.611
We tried
for years and years.

64
00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:00.092
[all] And years and years
and years and years.

65
00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.660
-And we saw so many doctors.
-[Carey] Oh!

66
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.836
And then
we saw this one doctor.

67
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.492
who took these teeny
little things called embryos.

68
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.451
and they put that inside me.

69
00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:12.235
-Ew.
-[Judith] Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.019
And then we found out

71
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.673
we weren't going to have
just one baby.

72
00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:18.546
We were going to have
two babies.

73
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.679
And that's how we got
you pair of chuckleheads.

74
00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:23.855
[Alex]
Maybe they're just easier.

75
00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:25.727
What about Alex?

76
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.342
Yes. What about me?

77
00:03:34.388 --> 00:03:35.432
You were no trouble.

78
00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:41.133
[Alex] On some level.

79
00:03:41.308 --> 00:03:43.745
I wonder whether
I keep silently asking

80
00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.443
and re-asking
that fundamental question

81
00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.576
of just
who you people are.

82
00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.362
Because every moment
they seem to be asking

83
00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:54.886
the same question of me.

84
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.589
Are you going to call in

85
00:04:01.763 --> 00:04:02.851
-a guidance counselor?
-Dude.

86
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.113
[he chuckles]

87
00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:07.029
I'm really impressed
with your writing. though.

88
00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:08.465
[groans]
No. I should have stuck

89
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.945
to Holden Caulfield's ducks

90
00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.686
and spared you my angst.

91
00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:13.601
It's horrible.

92
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:17.257
Nothing about you
is horrible. Alex.

93
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:19.346
Rohan. I--
I literally have one friend

94
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.782
left over from kindergarten

95
00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:22.479
and she doesn't even go here.

96
00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:25.047
Hence your charity lunches.

97
00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:27.919
Your place
in the social pecking order

98
00:04:28.093 --> 00:04:29.747
forever undefinable.

99
00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:32.315
This. too. shall pass.
Trust me.

100
00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:33.925
It's hard to believe
I ever went through

101
00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.405
the same thing. right?

102
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:36.798
Uh. It's super easy
to believe.

103
00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:39.279
-You are a total nerd.
-[he chuckles]

104
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.588
Every weekend.
I set aside six hours.

105
00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:45.807
just for my book.

106
00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:46.982
Just to write.

107
00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:48.940
I think you should try it.

108
00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:51.291
Maybe you can
discipline yourself

109
00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:54.250
to write something
not so horrible.

110
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:56.557
Okay. so.
let's write together.

111
00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.167
This Saturday.

112
00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:02.650
Oh. um. Alex. I don't know
if that's appropriate.

113
00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:04.608
Rohan. calm down.
We'’re friends. right?

114
00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:09.657
Okay.

115
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:11.833
Um. but right now.
it's not Rohan. it'’s--

116
00:05:12.007 --> 00:05:13.704
Mr. Amira. Got it.

117
00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:19.884
[Rohan exhales]
All right. guys.

118
00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:22.539
Let'’s talk about
these ducks. huh?

119
00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:27.501
So. wait.
You didn't have sex with him?

120
00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:30.547
No. his Mom was.
like. in the next room.

121
00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:33.071
Are you sure it wasn't because
you're afraid of herpes?

122
00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:35.422
Because if it's herpes.
I totally get it.

123
00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:36.945
I'm terrified of herpes.

124
00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:38.773
Can you please
stop saying herpes?

125
00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:40.818
Yeah. it travels through
your saliva or your skin...

126
00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:43.430
and it doesn't even matter
if you use a condom.

127
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:44.866
because it's just
spreading out there.

128
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.171
all over the place
all the time.

129
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.651
-Mm-hmm.
-And it never goes away.

130
00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:49.392
because it lives
in your fucking spine.

131
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:51.873
It'’s literally all we talk
about in bio is. like...

132
00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.702
disgusting
genitalia scare tactics.

133
00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.356
And herpes aside.
you still have to be. like.

134
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.140
way up in their face
with. like.

135
00:05:58.314 --> 00:05:59.750
all their pimples
and blackheads and nose breath

136
00:05:59.924 --> 00:06:01.143
and whatever
they fucking ate for lunch.

137
00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:02.927
-It'’s disgusting.
-Okay.

138
00:06:03.101 --> 00:06:04.842
Now all I am thinking about
is if he has herpes.

139
00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:06.104
-Good.
-Okay. look.

140
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:08.280
You just need to
find someone.

141
00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:11.371
Anyone at your school
and just do it already.

142
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.070
Your vag is not some
sort of sacred temple.

143
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:16.941
-[Alex] Okay!
-It'’s just a vag.

144
00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:19.248
[Alex] Whatever.

145
00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:20.815
[Nancy] Or I don'’t know.
Get your mom to hug you.

146
00:06:23.774 --> 00:06:25.428
Funny how you say I'm going--

147
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:27.038
You are goddamn well going.

148
00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:29.389
-My stomach hurts.
-It's gonna be okay.

149
00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:30.912
Grandma always
looks at me like I'm fungus

150
00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.435
and then asks
if I have a boyfriend.

151
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:34.045
I'm telling her I'm gay.

152
00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.743
-You're not gay.
-Maybe I am.

153
00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:37.179
Oh. are you coming out?

154
00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:39.094
No.

155
00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:40.965
I'm just not going
to grandma'’s.

156
00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.880
Carey. It'’s okay.

157
00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:44.926
She doesn't have to go
if she doesn't want to go.

158
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.754
If she's in a mood.
then it's not worth it.

159
00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:48.756
-Come on.
-Thanks a lot.

160
00:06:49.887 --> 00:06:52.063
[Judith] You okay. baby?
Where does it hurt?

161
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.549
[mellow
contemplative music plays]

162
00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:07.818
[doorbell rings]

163
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.389
-[Alex] Just through here.
-[cell phone ringing]

164
00:07:13.563 --> 00:07:15.565
Hey. so.
where are your folks?

165
00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:17.045
Oh. they're visiting
my grandma.

166
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:18.960
-Oh.
-[ringing stops]

167
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:22.529
There'’s a coffee shop
down the street.

168
00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:23.878
Maybe we should
just go there.

169
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:27.229
You're a tea person. right?

170
00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:30.841
Uh-huh.

171
00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:41.330
So.
what's your novel about?

172
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.899
[Rohan] Well.
it's kind of complicated.

173
00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:47.379
but it's about soldiers
in World War One.

174
00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.338
Write what you know. right?
[she laughs]

175
00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:51.340
-What?
-Uh. nothing.

176

00:49:19.695 --> 00:49:22.046
I can tell you
there's a lot she doesn't know.

888
00:49:23.308 --> 00:49:26.093
Thought her grandfather
was dead. for one thing.

889
00:49:26.267 --> 00:49:30.271
[suspenseful music plays]

890
00:49:44.764 --> 00:49:46.766
So it. like. turns out
that we sort of have the same.

891
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.594
like. drawing style.

892
00:49:49.682 --> 00:49:51.640
Like. I don't know
if-- if I really believe

893
00:49:51.814 --> 00:49:54.556
in the nature
over nurture argument.

894
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:56.732
but I really do think that.
like. there might be.

895
00:49:56.906 --> 00:49:59.779
like. some sort of compelling
argument for the fact that.

896
00:49:59.953 --> 00:50:03.783
like. genes affect
artistic stylings. you know?

897
00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:06.438
You know. um...

898
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.136
Karl and Sarah are probably
wondering where I am.

899
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.355
Who Sarah?

900
00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:14.011
Karl'’s cousin. Sarah Kelly.

901
00:50:15.316 --> 00:50:17.101
His mom's cousin.
Sarah Kelly?

902
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:19.364
-The church lady?
-Yeah.

903
00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:22.019
Uh. he runs her shop
and he's actually. like.

904
00:50:22.193 --> 00:50:23.629
a really good mechanic.

905
00:50:25.196 --> 00:50:26.980
[Beau chuckling]
How about that?

906
00:50:27.154 --> 00:50:29.156
Oh. he'’s-- he's here.

907
00:50:30.331 --> 00:50:31.376

908
00:50:33.378 --> 00:50:34.466

909
00:50:36.729 --> 00:50:37.860
Come here.

[Beau groans]

911
00:50:43.301 --> 00:50:44.389
So.

912
00:50:45.172 --> 00:50:46.434
Where you been
hiding yourself?

913
00:50:47.653 --> 00:50:48.741
Keep busy.

This is great.

916
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.703
Sit down. have a beer.

917
00:50:55.269 --> 00:50:56.662
No. we can't stay long.

918
00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:58.620
What are you talking about?

919
00:50:58.794 --> 00:50:59.969
You just got here.

920
00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:02.276

[Beau grunts]

00:51:11.894 --> 00:51:15.115
Alex here was telling me
you two draw alike.

923
00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:17.335
More artists!

924
00:51:18.466 --> 00:51:19.598
That's what we need.

925
00:51:21.513 --> 00:51:23.950
Did he tell you I worked
40 years at the plant?

926
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:27.780
Got to know your place. right?

927
00:51:32.132 --> 00:51:33.351
You're not thirsty?

928
00:51:35.701 --> 00:51:36.919
No. I'm all right.

929
00:51:38.356 --> 00:51:39.444
Oh.

930
00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:43.056
Oh. I get it.

931
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.319
You and the bottle.

932
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.365
It never led anywhere good.

933
00:51:47.539 --> 00:51:48.975
You know what.
it's getting late--

934
00:51:49.149 --> 00:51:50.716
Maybe if you would have
sobered up sooner

935
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:52.283
or you wouldn't have put
that kid in the hospital.

936
00:51:53.806 --> 00:51:57.940
I mean. of all the asses
in the world you gotta kick...

937
00:51:59.028 --> 00:52:00.508
that's the one you choose?

938
00:52:00.682 --> 00:52:03.946
-We should get going.
-Why that kid. Karl?

939
00:52:05.165 --> 00:52:06.732
I really want to know.

940
00:52:10.214 --> 00:52:11.780
[Karl] I didn't like the way
he was touching

941
00:52:11.954 --> 00:52:14.000
that girl at the bar. Dad.
I told you that already.

942
00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:15.915
[Beau] Well. that's an answer.

943
00:52:17.003 --> 00:52:18.657
-That's a fucking--
-You're an asshole.

944
00:52:20.876 --> 00:52:22.487
-What was that. honey?
-Alex. stop--

945
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:23.792
No. you're a bully
and you don't like your son

946
00:52:23.966 --> 00:52:25.098
because he's better than you.

947
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:28.057
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

948
00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:31.539
Huh? Huh? What you got? Huh?

949
00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:32.845
[Alex] Stop!

950
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.116
Visit's over.

951
00:52:44.857 --> 00:52:45.988
Get out of here.

00:52:46.554 --> 00:52:49.731
-I'm so sorry.
-The hell were you thinking?

953
00:52:49.905 --> 00:52:51.429
You-- you told me he was dead.

954
00:52:51.603 --> 00:52:53.082
It ever occur to you
I had a reason?

955
00:52:54.475 --> 00:52:56.173
Shit. Fuck. I'm sorry.

956
00:52:56.347 --> 00:52:57.826
I-- I suck. I suck. I suck.

Get in the car.

958
00:52:59.698 --> 00:53:02.179
-Get in the car.
-You can yell at me some more.

959
00:53:07.009 --> 00:53:08.141
You're going home tomorrow.

So. shockingly.
I have fucked everything up.

967
00:54:09.855 --> 00:54:12.553
Well. at least you and your dad
were getting along well.

968

[Alex scoffs]

969
00:54:14.642 --> 00:54:15.904
Yeah.
if by getting along well

970
00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:17.950
you mean
yelling at me a lot.

971
00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.213
Which I guess is. like.

par for the course
of parents. right?

973
00:54:23.303 --> 00:54:25.218
He was probably scared
something had happened to you.

974
00:54:26.524 --> 00:54:28.003
He screamed
because he gives a shit.

975
00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:32.225
So how long
have you known you were gay?

976
00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:37.665
Okay. you're from a major
metropolitan city.

977
00:54:37.839 --> 00:54:39.276
so you've seen probably

of pansexuality out there.

00:54:41.887 --> 00:54:43.758
I mean. you have
probably fucked girls.

Oh. yeah.
My life is just a big orgy.

981
00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:47.588
Yeah. I'm sure it is.

-You didn't answer mine.

with a girl?

Are you kidding me?

Apparently not.

00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:44.819
-Pretty sure he's not gay.
-How the hell do you know that?

-How is that your business?
-You know. as long as

997
00:55:46.647 --> 00:55:47.692
you're in this house.
you do exactly--

Oh. until tomorrow?

999
00:55:50.042 --> 00:55:51.130
Go to your room.

You should have sent her away.

I lost control today.

Are you sure you just
don't want to believe that?

1022

I believe it
because I believe it.

That's what faith is.

I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I was worried.

1031

I shouldn't have
said that. uh...

1032
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.228
I shouldn't have made you think
your grandfather was dead.

01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:33.760
-Well. I didn't ask you.
-Well. I'm trying to explain.

1064
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:38.156
Anyways. they're.
like. super pissed.

1065
01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:40.288
But they didn't even.
like. ask me why.

1066
01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:42.551
They were just like.

1067
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:43.727
"Oh. yeah.
there goes our idiot daughter

1068
01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:45.206
being a jackass again."

1069
01:00:45.772 --> 01:00:48.296
They didn't respect me enough
to want to know why.

1070
01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:55.042
-So they're not perfect.
-It's an understatement.

1071
01:00:57.479 --> 01:00:59.612
[sighs] Better than some.

1072
01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:05.357
[Sarah] Alex. Karl! Dinner!

1073
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:06.706
[both] Coming!

1074
01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:27.161
[phone buzzing]

1075
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:31.992
Alex. are you okay?

1076
01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:33.951
Yeah.

1077
01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:35.300
What's up?

1078
01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:39.043
Your dad's asleep.
What's going on?

1079
01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:44.048
Mom. um.
were you ever in a band?

1080
01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:45.702
-What? [chuckles]
-[Alex] Okay.

1081
01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:49.183
I know this isn't. like.
the most opportune time to ask.

1082
01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:52.056
but did you ever. like.
play in a rock band?

1083
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.714
Well. before you were born.
I did lots of things.

1084
01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:58.932
[Alex] You never told me.

1085
01:01:59.106 --> 01:02:00.412
You didn't ask.

1086
01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:01.718
I totally asked.

1087
01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:05.156
We were called
My Friend's Band.

1088
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.419
-[Alex] [chuckles] Seriously?
-Yeah.

1089
01:02:07.593 --> 01:02:10.074
And my friend. Marco.
he was the lead singer.

1090
01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:13.991
he said that the hot chick
had to play the bass. so.

1091
01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:16.254
-Wait. you were the hot chick?
-[Judith] Hey.

1092
01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:18.517
You try squeezing out
three kids.

1093
01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.388
See how you look.

1094
01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:21.650
[Alex] I forgot to tell you.
I'm pregnant.

1095
01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:25.524
[Alex and Judith chuckling]

1096
01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:27.874
Obviously. I'm kidding.
[Alex chuckling]

1097
01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:30.747
I mean. not the best joke.
you know?

1098
01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:35.403
Mom. are you there?

1099
01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:38.363
Hey. Alex.

1100
01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:39.756
Yeah?

1101
01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:47.807
How's school going?

1102
01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:51.115
Good.
It's going good.

1103
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.552
How's your roommate.
what was her name again?

1104
01:02:53.726 --> 01:02:55.380
The one that has
night terrors?

1105
01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:56.773
Night terrors?

1106
01:02:57.643 --> 01:03:01.560
Oh. uh. right. um. Natalka.

1107
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:03.780
I think she's. like.
Ukrainian or something.

1108
01:03:04.955 --> 01:03:06.739
[whispering] Speaking of which.
she's sleeping right now.

1109
01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.132
so I have to go.

1110
01:03:20.187 --> 01:03:23.495
[phone ringing]

1111
01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:26.715
Hello?

1112
01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:29.718
Oh. Mrs. Fixel.
What can I do for you?

1113
01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:37.596
[phone buzzing]

1114
01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.513
-Hi. Dad.
-Are you all right?

1115
01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:44.472
-Where are you?
-Dad. stop yelling.

1116
01:03:44.646 --> 01:03:46.039
-I'm fine.
-The hell you're fine.

1117
01:03:46.213 --> 01:03:47.911
Where are you. Alex?

1118
01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:50.261
Alex. please.
Please. just-- where are you?

1119
01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:52.132
-Tell us where you are.
-[Alex] I'm fine.

1120
01:03:52.306 --> 01:03:54.178
-I'm with a friend.
-She said she's with a friend.

1121
01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:56.006
She doesn't have
any fucking friends. hold on.

1122
01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.703
Can you tell dad
not to have an aneurysm?

1123
01:03:57.877 --> 01:03:59.705
[Corey] Hey.

1124
01:03:59.879 --> 01:04:01.402
How long did you think that
you were going to keep this up?

1125
01:04:01.576 --> 01:04:02.969
Hm?

1126
01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:04.797
What exactly is your plan here?

1127
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.104
Do you think about
anybody but yourself?

1128
01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:10.803
Do you imagine any
consequences of your actions?

1129
01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:13.197
Because
you are in so much trouble--

1130
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.429
Let's order some food.

1131
01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:33.130
Come on.

1132
01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.787
[emotional
instrumental playing]

1133
01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:40.137
[Alex sniffles]

1134
01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.186
Son of a bitch.

1135
01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:53.759
Yes. this is Sheriff
Reggie Stratford

1136
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:56.109
calling from
Newburgh in Washington.

1137
01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:01.506
The phone call
seemed to spook you.

1138
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:04.335
What happened?

1139
01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:06.903
I may have to go back soon.

1140
01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:09.166
It's home stuff.

1141
01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.780
The Sheriff
said some things.

1142
01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:19.393
I'm not proud of
what happened with Brandon.

1143
01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:23.441
But he was bothering
a girl that night. and...

1144
01:05:24.746 --> 01:05:27.053
it was two drunk hotheads
fighting and I won.

1145
01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:30.883
But there's other things
that happened--

1146
01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:32.537
[Alex]
Maybe I don't need to know.

1147
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:33.930
I thought I did.
but maybe I don't want to know

1148
01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:36.019
because I like you now.

1149
01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.850
[delivery guy]
Hey. Karl. Got the food.

1150
01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:43.809
-Two burgers.
-Yes. sir.

1151
01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.202
Burgers? Are you serious?

1152
01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:48.335
Ew.

1153
01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:50.033
[delivery guy] Who is this?

1154
01:05:52.252 --> 01:05:53.558
That's my daughter. Alex.

1155
01:05:56.778 --> 01:05:58.650
[muffled shouting]

1156
01:05:58.824 --> 01:06:00.434
[Alex shouting]
I regret nothing!

1157
01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:01.914
You could have
at least tried it.

1158
01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:03.698
No. Are you kidding me?

1159
01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:04.873
My friend Nancy didn't eat meat
for five years...

1160
01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.092
-And?
-...and she had

1161
01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.528
a chicken cutlet of sandwich

1162
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.661
and she vomited
all over herself.

1163
01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:17.495
Alex hasn't been
entirely honest with us.

1164
01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:25.807
You're looking
at possible kidnapping.

1165
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.461
and you're crossing
state lines--

1166
01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:28.897
[Alex]
Shit. shit. shit. shit. Fuck--

1167
01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.595
Please. Alex. language.

1168
01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:33.119
-God damn it. fuck!
-[Sarah] Alex. enough!

1169
01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:36.166
You called them?
Why would you call them?

1170
01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.430
-It's my job?
-[Alex] Shit. shit. shit.

1171
01:06:39.604 --> 01:06:41.606
Listen. I lied to everyone.
Karl had no idea I snuck away.

1172
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.129
It's my fault. okay?

1173
01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.131
I'm a fucking idiot.
I'm a fucking--

1174
01:06:45.305 --> 01:06:46.959
-It's not-- you're not--
-Hey. hey. hey.

1175
01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:49.483
Hey.

1176
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:51.833
I'm going to be okay.

1177
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.748
Okay?
Everything's going to be fine.

1178
01:06:58.492 --> 01:06:59.537
Sheriff Stratford.

1179
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.976
I know
you don't owe me anything...

1180
01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:06.413
but could you
give us a minute?

1181
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.633
And then
you could take her away.

1182
01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:09.982
You can arrest me.
I don't care.

1183
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:12.158
Just give us one minute.
Please.

1184
01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:19.818
Sarah.
got another cup of coffee?

1185
01:07:23.648 --> 01:07:24.779
One last cup.

1186
01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:35.877
Sit down. okay? Please?

1187
01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:38.837
It's-- [Karl sighs]

1188
01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:49.630
I haven't seen your mom
in a long time.

1189
01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:51.241
You don't have to
say anything.

1190
01:07:51.415 --> 01:07:52.807
-it's fine.
-But the thing of it is--

1191
01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:58.639
I told you before.

1192
01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:02.339
I was maybe 21
when I met your mom.

1193
01:08:04.645 --> 01:08:06.430
I'd been in the city
a few months.

1194
01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:08.562
And I had no money.

1195
01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:10.173
I didn't have
any real friends and...

1196
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.525
I was-- I was drinking a lot.

1197
01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:20.922
And even though she was older
and she was married--

1198
01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:25.536
Yeah. you hooked up anyway.

1199
01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:27.407
Hold on.

1200
01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:30.106
We went on walks.

1201
01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:32.630
mostly talking about
the art show

1202
01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:34.240
she was going
to put on and-- [sighs]

1203
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.722
I didn't know
if it was real...

1204
01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:41.204
but I was grateful
that it might be.

1205
01:08:42.901 --> 01:08:44.598
And one night
when I got off work...

1206
01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:47.601
she was really upset.

1207
01:08:49.864 --> 01:08:51.562
Some fight
with her husband.

1208
01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:53.738
some problem
with another doctor.

1209
01:08:58.003 --> 01:08:59.831
So we went to a bar
for a drink.

1210
01:09:03.922 --> 01:09:05.967
And that drink
turned into a couple of drinks.

1211
01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:09.275
And then
a couple of more drinks.

1212
01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:10.755
And...

1213
01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:15.194
we talked about everything.

1214
01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:21.026
And it felt so good
to be around her.

1215
01:09:22.288 --> 01:09:24.247
I didn't notice
how many drinks we'd had.

1216
01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:29.817
And. um...

1217
01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:33.517
after a while...

1218
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:35.867
I got up
to use the bathroom.

1219
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.392
and she said
she'd better use it. too.

1220
01:09:41.612 --> 01:09:43.396
And I think
I took that as a signal.

1221
01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:48.836
Because we went
back there and. um...

1222
01:09:50.664 --> 01:09:51.839
she smiled at me.

1223
01:09:52.013 --> 01:09:53.232
And...

1224
01:09:54.146 --> 01:09:55.408
That's how it started.

1225
01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:58.063
-[Alex chuckling]
-[Karl sighs]

1226
01:09:58.237 --> 01:10:00.196
[knocking on door]

1227
01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:08.508
-[Sarah] Hi. you must be
Judith.

1228
01:10:08.682 --> 01:10:10.162
[Carey] Where is she? Alex?

1229
01:10:12.295 --> 01:10:14.732
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1230
01:10:14.906 --> 01:10:16.212
Calm down.

1231
01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:18.605
[Karl] Hi.

1232
01:10:19.476 --> 01:10:20.781
Uh. hello.

1233
