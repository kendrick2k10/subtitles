3
00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:13.665
Hm.

4
00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:16.364
Hi. Mom.

5
00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:19.889
I just finished at the gym.

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.674
I did a spin class
and a full circuit.

7
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.285
I'm exhausted and
I need to eat.

8
00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:26.113
Yes.

9
00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:28.419
Mom. I'm taking this
pageant seriously.

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.378
Literally. I am so
dizzy and all I've had

11
00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:31.988
to eat today is a
stick of celery.

12
00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:33.946
What- whatever.

13
00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:35.861
Mom. Mom. I gotta go.

14
00:00:37.907 --> 00:00:42.390
Harper. what a surprise.

15
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.479
I haven't seen you
at the gym in months.

16
00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.221
Adeline. I'm here every day.

17
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:49.919
Guess we must be on
different schedules then.

18
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.401
You know. Lilliana. she's
been working out twice a day

19
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:55.707
for months to prepare
for the pageant.

20
00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:56.839
Oh.

21
00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.362
Well. I gotta get going.

22
00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:00.190
Where are you rushing off to?

23
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.279
Just dinner with some friends.

24
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.369
Oh. it's kind of late for
a meal. don't you think?

25
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.240
Most of the girls just chew

26
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.024
on an almond when
they get hungry.

27
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.200
At least. the winners do.

28
00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.812
Have you been jogging?

29
00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:15.031
No. Why?

30
00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:18.556
Oh. you're just so
sweaty and out of breath.

31
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:20.906
Guess it was a little strenuous
getting outta your car.

32
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.388
You remind me so
much of your mother.

33
00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.477
Really? How so?

34
00:01:27.957 --> 00:01:31.003
Well. when I competed
against her. many years ago.

35
00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:33.919
she lacked the discipline
needed for pageants.

36
00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:37.619
That's funny. because
if I remember correctly.

37
00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.883
she beat you. several
times in fact.

38
00:01:42.232 --> 00:01:44.887
Sometimes people find
other ways of winning.

39
00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:47.628
especially when there's a male
judge open to being swayed.

40
00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.893
Are you insinuating
that my mother

41
00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:52.460
slept her way to a crown?

42
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.941
There's no insinuation.
honey. she did.

43
00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.466
and that's why you
remind me so much of her.

44
00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:02.426
You know. Adeline. you
walk around like you own

45
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:05.603
the pageant world. but the
truth is. is you're a joke.

46
00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:09.693
You've never even won a
title. but your mother has.

47
00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:11.653
And the only reason
that you continue

48
00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:14.656
to stay relevant is because
she funds the whole thing.

49
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:19.835
How sad. Mommy pays
so you can play.

50
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.532
How dare you talk
to me like that?

51
00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:25.841
Oh my God. did you just
put your hands on me?

52
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:28.844
Oh. I'm gonna sue you for
everything that you've got.

53
00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:29.671
Oh. wait.

54
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:30.976
Oh. you don't have anything.

55
00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:32.108
because Mommy owns it all.

56
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.718
Shut the hell up. Harper.

57
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.459
Oh. yeah? Or what?

58
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.548
God. you're pathetic. Adeline.

59
00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.508
Your daughter knows it.
your mother knows it.

60
00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:42.336
even your husband knew it.

61
00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:44.599
That's why he finally
dumped your sorry-

62
00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:54.130
Oh no.

63
00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:09.972
No.

64
00:03:46.922 --> 00:03:48.576
No. it's not okay.

65
00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.491
Why wasn't this
problem flagged before?

66
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.103
We were supposed to have
our grand opening next week?

67
00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.107
Sure. Thanks.

68
00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:01.589
Mom. what's going on?

69
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.940
The building inspector
came out to give the okay

70
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.202
so that I could open the spa.

71
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.987
but we didn't get the approval.

72
00:04:09.118 --> 00:04:10.641
What? Why?

73
00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:12.513
Apparently. there was
some structural damage

74
00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:14.776
that was missed in the
original inspection.

75
00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:16.821
Now they're saying we can't
open until all the repairs

76
00:04:16.952 --> 00:04:19.346
are complete. which could
take at least six weeks.

77
00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:20.825
That's awful. Mom.

78
00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:22.218
Is there anything I can do?

79
00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:25.003
I wish there was. sweetie.

80
00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:28.529
I'm just happy to
see you.

81
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.053
Which I thought you had to
be at school until 6:00.

82
00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:34.622
I. I finished my project early
and I got some good news.

83
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.232
so I decided to rush home.

84
00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:40.454
Well. what is it?

85
00:04:40.584 --> 00:04:42.020
You know that literature
residency program

86
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.805
I talked to you about?

87
00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.197
Yes.

88
00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:46.242
They picked me to go.

89
00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:48.679
Ah! Yes!

90
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.725
That means I would get to
spend my first semester

91
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:51.769
in college in London.

92
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.990
Ah. sweetie. that's amazing.

93
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.472
But. but I. I. I
can't accept it. Mom.

94
00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:00.822
Well. why not?

95
00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:05.261
Because the program
itself. it. it costs money.

96
00:05:05.392 --> 00:05:07.829
And housing isn't cheap.

97
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.614
Without the spa being
able to open up.

98
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:13.617
you know. I didn't...

99
00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:15.010
Maybe we can get a loan.

100
00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:17.969
But I thought with
all the medical bills

101
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.059
from dad and the
second mortgage.

102
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.539
we wouldn't be eligible.

103
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.413
I'll tell you what.
you don't worry about that.

104
00:05:26.543 --> 00:05:27.718
Let me figure it out.

105
00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.199
I gotta make some calls
about the damage. anyway.

106
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.070
I'll call the bank
and see about a loan.

107
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:34.986
But you're going to London.
no matter what I have

108
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.075
to do to get you there.

109
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:38.599
Okay.

110
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:39.382
Okay.

111
00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:10.587
A
mother-daughter pageant.

112
00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:11.762
Oh. no.

113
00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:15.244
No. I know it sounds crazy.
but look at the cash prize.

114
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.985
$100.000.

115
00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:19.640
That's enough to
cover my residency.

116
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.382
and there'll be plenty left
over to put into the spa

117
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:24.166
and pay off the bills from dad.

118
00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.256
There's no fee to
enter the pageant.

119
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.127
Yeah. but don't
people train for years

120
00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:30.825
to win these things?

121
00:06:30.955 --> 00:06:32.348
I don't know.

122
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.742
I. I looked it up online.
and there are three segments.

123
00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:37.308
There's the evening
gown portion.

124
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.051
the interview section. and
the talent competition.

125
00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:41.226
Talent?

126
00:06:41.357 --> 00:06:42.880
What. like singing or
dancing?

127
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.099
Sweetie. I have two left feet.

128
00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.187
and you've heard me do karaoke.

129
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:48.233
No. it says
you can do anything;

130
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:51.541
paint. read your own
poetry. perfect for me.

131
00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:55.197
uh. juggling. cake
decorating. martial arts.

132
00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:56.807
play an instrument.

133
00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:59.114
You play the violin
and are really good.

134
00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:02.509
Sweetie. that was
a long time ago.

135
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.381
But. the worst thing that
can happen is we lose.

136
00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:08.558
Yeah. I don't know. honey.

137
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.129
The first step is
to apply online.

138
00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.610
and I think we
should give it a try.

139
00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:21.092
Please.

140
00:07:22.354 --> 00:07:24.400
Don't ever say I don't love you.

141
00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:34.454
"Why do you wanna
enter the pageant?"

142
00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:36.760
Hmm.

143
00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:43.985
I've never done
a pageant before.

144
00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:48.642
but it's a great way to...

145
00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:51.166
Stretch outside
your comfort zone

146
00:07:53.647 --> 00:07:58.173
and encourage other
people to be brave.

147
00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:00.828
and do the same.

148
00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:09.358
You're looking so
much better. honey.

149
00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:12.317
I knew getting you
that chemical peel

150
00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:15.495
and those fractional lasers on
your face would do the trick.

151
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.280
Thank you. Mom. for reminding
me that my skin is a mess.

152
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.543
Honey. I just want you
to look as beautiful

153
00:08:20.674 --> 00:08:22.763
on the outside as you
are on the inside.

154
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:26.027
especially with our big
night coming up.

155
00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:27.898
It's our first
mother-daughter pageant.

156
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:29.683
Oh. isn't this so exciting?

157
00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:31.641
Yeah. I mean. it's
gonna be really fun.

158
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:34.296
Fun?

159
00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:36.558
Honey. this is a competition.

160
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.778
You are well aware
of how serious it is.

161
00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:39.256
Mm. I know. I know.

162
00:08:39.388 --> 00:08:40.302
I've done this before.

163
00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:49.746
Did your father make plans
with you for his birthday yet?

164
00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:51.269
Um. he's still working
on his work schedule.

165
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.271
but he is going to.

166
00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:54.446
Or he's waiting to
see what his flavor

167
00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:55.404
of the week wants to do.

168
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.188
Mom. stop.

169
00:08:58.363 --> 00:08:59.582
If your own father
doesn't wanna make plans

170
00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:01.279
with his daughter.
that's his loss.

171
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.498
He does. He texted-

172
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.587
Come on. let's go for a jog.

173
00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:05.849
I'll race you.

174
00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:07.329
We both have to get in shape
if we wanna win this pageant.

175
00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:14.031
It's the pageant.

176
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.207
Oh my God. answer it.

177
00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:19.254
Hello?

178
00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:22.736
Emilia. hi. this is Faye from
Atlanta Regional Pageants.

179
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.999
I'm calling to let you
know that after hundreds

180
00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:28.350
of applications. you are one
of 10 mother-daughter teams

181
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.352
to make it to the
next round shoot.

182
00:09:30.482 --> 00:09:31.440
We are?

183
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.355
I mean. um. thank
you so much. Faye.

184
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:35.183
We're so excited.

185
00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:36.793
You're welcome.

186
00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:39.753
Now. we have a meet
and greet next week.

187
00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:41.668
I'll send you all
the details by email.

188
00:09:41.798 --> 00:09:42.669
That sounds great.

189
00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:44.105
Thank you. again. Faye.

190
00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:45.715
You're so welcome.

191
00:09:45.846 --> 00:09:46.934
We'll see you next week.

192
00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:47.935
Bye.

193
00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:51.547
Ooh. yes!

194
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:54.376
Oh my God. we did it. we did it!

195
00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:56.987
Yes! Oh my God. I told you.

196
00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.032
Oh. you did?

197
00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:00.034
-Oh. yes.
-Wow!

198
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.209
Are you ready for this?

199
00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:03.080
Are you ready?

200
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:03.951
What have you gotten me into?

201
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:04.952
Yes!

202
00:10:05.953 --> 00:10:06.649
Aah!

203
00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:22.970
Everyone looks so elegant.

204
00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:27.975
I mean. the email didn't
mention a dress code.

205
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:30.934
Okay. come on.

206
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.334
Look at Patrice.
she looks so basic.

207
00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:40.378
Hm.

208
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:42.511
And so red.

209
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.034
Mm.

210
00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:46.863
Rumor is she and
Vivienne. early favorites.

211
00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:47.995
Really?

212
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:48.996
Hm.

213
00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:50.954
Hm.

214
00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:52.956
Do you know what? One second.

215
00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.350
-Hi.
-Oh God. here she comes.

216
00:10:56.394 --> 00:10:57.787
Help.

217
00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:59.528
Adeline. Darcy.

218
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.095
Oh.

219
00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:02.400
Mwah.

220
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.968
A mother-daughter pageant.
so exciting. right?

221
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:06.230
It really is.

222
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.885
Well. this must be like
a normal day for you.

223
00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.800
I hear you've been
competing quite a bit lately

224
00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:12.541
on the Mrs. pageant circuit.

225
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:13.629
Very cute.

226
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.936
I dabble
here and there.

227
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:17.459
Won a crown or two.

228
00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:19.504
But over the last
year. I focused

229
00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:20.941
mainly on my charity work.

230
00:11:21.071 --> 00:11:21.811
I saw.

231
00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:23.595
You were named Woman of the Year

232
00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:25.423
for the Atlanta
Heart Foundation.

233
00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:26.729
Congratulations.

234
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.122
Thank you.

235
00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:29.993
I'm really proud of the
work I've done with them.

236
00:11:30.124 --> 00:11:32.387
Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:37.174
Um. well. good
luck today. ladies.

238
00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:39.394
You too.

239
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.398
She's not gonna be
their favorite for long.

240
00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:45.400
What was that?

241
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.402
Who are those two?

242
00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:50.579
I don't know.

243
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.276
Go find out. Go.

244
00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:58.761
Hi. you must be new.

245
00:11:58.892 --> 00:11:59.893
I'm Darcy.

246
00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:01.503
Oh. I'm Emilia.
and this is Sophie.

247
00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:02.722
-Hey.
-Nice to meet you.

248
00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:04.245
I haven't seen you around.

249
00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:06.421
Pageants are such a small world.

250
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:08.423
Actually. it's our
first time entering.

251
00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:10.686
You mean. ever?

252
00:12:10.817 --> 00:12:12.296
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes.

253
00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:13.471
Oh my.

254
00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:16.170
And you were chosen
as one of the 10.

255
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.301
That's...

256
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.480
Well. what talent do
you plan on performing?

257
00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:25.309
Oh. I write poetry. so I
think I'll do a reading.

258
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.790
Oh. how sweet.

259
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:30.358
And my mom is really
good at the violin.

260
00:12:30.488 --> 00:12:31.707
Oh. she's talking me up.

261
00:12:31.838 --> 00:12:34.275
The truth is. I haven't
played in quite some time.

262
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.538
Hm.

263
00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:44.633
Crystal. my new pageant
coach. has led several

264
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.548
of her clients to nationals.

265
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.421
I'm telling you. working with
her has been game-changing.

266
00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:52.075
Never heard of her.

267
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:55.078
Adeline. it's so
good to see you.

268
00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:56.384
You as well. How are things?

269
00:12:56.514 --> 00:12:59.779
Great. I just celebrated my
25th wedding anniversary.

270
00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:02.520
Still feels like we're in
the honeymoon stage though.

271
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:04.000
Congratulations.

272
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:05.436
Thank you.

273
00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:06.568
Is your mom here?

274
00:13:07.264 --> 00:13:09.005
Oh no. she's at another
important engagement today.

275
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:10.354
Mm.

276
00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:12.661
She must be thrilled you
made the cut this time?

277
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.533
Of course. but she'll
be even happier

278
00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:19.102
when Lilliana and
I win.

279
00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:21.452
Good luck with that.

280
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:22.366
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

281
00:13:22.497 --> 00:13:23.237
Mm-hm.

282
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.851
-I think I'll win.
-Hi. ladies.

283
00:13:28.982 --> 00:13:30.200
-Hi.
-Hey. Mom.

284
00:13:30.331 --> 00:13:32.594
-Having fun?
-Yeah. great time. mm-hmm.

285
00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:37.033
Ugh. oh my God. doing a
pageant with our mothers

286
00:13:37.164 --> 00:13:38.208
is so weird.

287
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:39.862
-It's so weird.
-Who decided to make it

288
00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:41.124
a mother-daughter
pageant anyway?

289
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.560
They've never done this before.

290
00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:43.735
Ugh. I have no idea.

291
00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.563
Well. as long as your
mom keeps winning

292
00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:47.391
the old people
pageants. we'll be okay.

293
00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.394
Well. what about you. Lilliana?

294
00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:52.788
Your mom is. like. really
intense about this stuff.

295
00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.530
Yeah. that's an understatement.

296
00:13:58.968 --> 00:14:01.666
The tag on this
dress is so itchy.

297
00:14:01.797 --> 00:14:03.886
-Do you have scissors?
-No.

298
00:14:04.017 --> 00:14:05.496
What did you find out
about the newbies?

299
00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:07.585
Oh. The mother's name is Emilia.

300
00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:09.326
She's opening a spa.

301
00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:10.240
Now. Sophie is the daughter.

302
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:12.895
She's into literature
and poetry.

303
00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:14.766
Emilia said she used
to play the violin.

304
00:14:14.897 --> 00:14:16.377
but now she's rusty.

305
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:19.641
That's it?

306
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:21.948
Well. I tried to find
out about a husband.

307
00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:23.340
but she didn't say much.

308
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:26.561
Get the feeling that there
is not one in the picture.

309
00:14:26.691 --> 00:14:27.997
Oh. great.

310
00:14:28.128 --> 00:14:30.304
That means she'll use a
single mother sob story

311
00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:32.480
to endear the judges.

312
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.656
Well. you're single now.

313
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:38.094
That's entirely different.

314
00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:40.923
Well. they don't seem
like much of a threat.

315
00:14:41.054 --> 00:14:42.577
Are you kidding?

316
00:14:42.707 --> 00:14:45.841
Do you remember the Teen Beauty
Atlanta pageant 3 years ago?

317
00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:49.279
That girl. Kenzie. the one
with the terribly shrill voice.

318
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.195
she took the title
over Lilliana.

319
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.718
That was Kenzie's first pageant.

320
00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:55.677
No. everybody here is a threat.

321
00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:58.375
But I got a bigger problem.

322
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.725
Patrice.

323
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:03.685
She's wandering around here
like she's already won.

324
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.470
Maybe she's just confident.

325
00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:07.297
Exactly.

326
00:15:07.428 --> 00:15:08.995
I'm not taking any chances.

327
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.084
Not for this pageant.

328
00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:13.913
You know my family
legacy's at risk.

329
00:15:14.043 --> 00:15:17.481
So. Patrice will be
disqualified when they find out

330
00:15:17.612 --> 00:15:19.875
that her precious
daughter's on drugs.

331
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.878
Slip this into Vivienne's
purse when she's not looking.

332
00:15:24.706 --> 00:15:27.100
Adeline. I can't do that.

333
00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:29.189
I mean. really.

334
00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:31.321
Well. then I guess I
need to break my silence

335
00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:32.801
on your little indiscretion.

336
00:15:34.846 --> 00:15:36.848
Adeline. please.

337
00:15:36.979 --> 00:15:38.938
Poor Mackenzie. she's
just out there bragging

338
00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:40.678
about her wedding anniversary.

339
00:15:41.853 --> 00:15:42.680
I guess she won't
think they're still

340
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:44.726
in the honeymoon
phase any longer.

341
00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:47.903
when she finds out you've
been screwing her husband.

342
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:50.645
How will your family
feel when they find out?

343
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.780
I will not plant drugs
on a teenage girl.

344
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:58.696
That's your choice.

345
00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.787
Fine.

346
00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:06.704
How will anyone even
know that Vivienne

347
00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:08.228
has drugs in her bag?

348
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:14.538
Don't worry about it.
just follow my lead.

349
00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:15.800
Unbelievable.

350
00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:27.682
Emilia.

351
00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:29.379
Hi. Darcy.

352
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.251
-Hi.
-Hi.

353
00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:33.601
-Hi.
-Hi.

354
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:34.732
You're Emilia. right?

355
00:16:34.863 --> 00:16:35.646
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm Adeline.

356
00:16:35.777 --> 00:16:36.734
Nice to meet you.

357
00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:38.519
Darcy says that you're
new to pageants.

358
00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:39.781
Yes.

359
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:41.652
Well. you must be so
nervous your first time?

360
00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:43.654
Oh. I'm certainly a
fish out of water here.

361
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:47.006
It's nice to see a new face.

362
00:16:47.136 --> 00:16:48.268
I look forward to getting
to know you better.

363
00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:49.747
-Same.
-This tag.

364
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.880
Oh. here. let me
help you with that.

365
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.882
I have got a sewing
kit in my purse.

366
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.579
and I think it's
got some scissors.

367
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.972
-Oh.
-Here we go.

368
00:16:58.234 --> 00:16:58.843
-Ah.
-There we go.

369
00:16:58.974 --> 00:16:59.714
Oh.

370
00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:01.585
Thank you.

371
00:17:01.716 --> 00:17:03.587
No problem.

372
00:17:03.718 --> 00:17:06.112
Well. it was nice
talking to you both.

373
00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:06.982
Bye-bye.

374
00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:12.291
What is she wearing?

375
00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:13.684
My gosh.

376
00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:16.296
I can't. it's just too hideous.

377
00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:22.563
Hm.

378
00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:28.351
Wow. I have
never seen anyone eat carbs

379
00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:30.266
at one of these things.

380
00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:31.267
Really?

381
00:17:31.398 --> 00:17:32.616
Really.

382
00:17:32.747 --> 00:17:35.054
Welcome to the pageant.
where most of these girls

383
00:17:35.184 --> 00:17:37.578
just exist off of baby
food and laxatives.

384
00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:41.016
That sounds very unhealthy.

385
00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:43.497
Yeah. no kidding.

386
00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:44.672
I'm Mia. by the way.

387
00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:47.283
I saw you talking to
my mom. Darcy. earlier.

388
00:17:47.414 --> 00:17:48.676
I'm Sophie.

389
00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:50.025
Nice to meet you.

390
00:17:50.156 --> 00:17:53.115
You too.

391
00:17:53.246 --> 00:17:56.684
Okay. so that's me.
obviously.

392
00:17:56.814 --> 00:17:58.990
That's Tatum.

393
00:17:59.121 --> 00:18:00.862
That's Lilliana Bordeaux.

394
00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:02.820
She won the pageant last year.

395
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:06.476
Her grandmother. Rebecca.
she's basically royalty.

396
00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:09.044
She's super connected
and convinces a bunch

397
00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:11.786
of rich people to donate money
to the pageant every year.

398
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:16.095
Everyone is so beautiful.

399
00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:18.880
Seriously. it's. it's
pretty intimidating.

400
00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:22.623
Oh my gosh. stop. You
are gorgeous too. okay?

401
00:18:23.363 --> 00:18:24.668
And you know what?

402
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.235
Look. if you want some
help practicing your walk.

403
00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:28.150
or you just want some pointers.

404
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:29.804
we should exchange numbers.

405
00:18:29.934 --> 00:18:31.022
Really?

406
00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:32.023
That's so cool of you.

407
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:33.590
Sure. gimme your phone.

408
00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:40.380
Who's that?

409
00:18:42.512 --> 00:18:43.426
That's Harper.

410
00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:46.908
She. um. she died.

411
00:18:47.778 --> 00:18:49.998
Oh my God. what. what happened?

412
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.043
A few weeks before
the last pageant.

413
00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:55.046
she was attacked in the
parking lot of her gym.

414
00:18:55.177 --> 00:18:57.092
That's terrible.

415
00:18:57.223 --> 00:18:58.833
Cops said it was
a random robbery.

416
00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:03.142
Honey. they're ready for
us to do our interview.

417
00:19:03.272 --> 00:19:04.055
All right. I'll be right there.

418
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:05.753
Okay.

419
00:19:05.883 --> 00:19:06.580
Thanks.

420
00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:18.809
It's really nice they're doing
a mother-daughter pageant

421
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.680
this year. don't you think?

422
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.290
Absolutely.

423
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:24.902
That's why I really. I hope
what I'm hearing is not true.

424
00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:26.252
What have you heard?

425
00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:27.688
But. you don't know?

426
00:19:27.818 --> 00:19:29.124
No. Tell me.

427
00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:33.302
Apparently. one of
the girls in this room

428
00:19:33.433 --> 00:19:35.391
has a serious drug problem.

429
00:19:35.522 --> 00:19:36.349
Who?

430
00:19:41.005 --> 00:19:41.702
Really?

431
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.490
Well. you'll have to excuse
me. I completely forgot I need

432
00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:49.188
to bring Roberta
some hand cream.

433
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:13.124
Mom. what are you doing?

434
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:14.213
Nothing.

435
00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:17.912
Okay. Well. they're
about to interview us.

436
00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:19.522
Oh. Okay.

437
00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:20.306
I'll be right there.

438
00:20:20.436 --> 00:20:21.220
Okay.

439
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:38.106
Ladies. ladies. gather around.

440
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.108
It's wonderful to see you
all here looking so lovely.

441
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.198
Pageants are about legacy.

442
00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:44.634
That's why we decided to host

443
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:47.115
a mother-daughter
pageant this season.

444
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.770
Our winners bring a wholesome
power to the community.

445
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.988
They are role models.

446
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:53.774
The current and future
leaders of our hometowns.

447
00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:55.732
our state. and our world.

448
00:20:55.863 --> 00:20:57.256
Ladies. I hope you'll take pride

449
00:20:57.386 --> 00:20:59.606
in this awesome responsibility.

450
00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:00.955
-Oh God! Oh my gosh!
-Oh!

451
00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:04.350
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

452
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.655
So embarrassing.

453
00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:07.875
Here. let me help you
pick these things up.

454
00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:09.093
Thank you.

455
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:12.096
Goodness. such a klutz.

456
00:21:12.227 --> 00:21:13.620
Did you see that?

457
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:17.493
What is this?

458
00:21:17.624 --> 00:21:18.407
Hm?

459
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.105
Is that drugs?

460
00:21:23.151 --> 00:21:25.066
Oh my God. it's true.

461
00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:27.590
-Oh my gosh.
-Whose purse is that?

462
00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:30.027
I think it's Vivienne's.

463
00:21:30.158 --> 00:21:31.942
That's not mine.

464
00:21:32.073 --> 00:21:33.292
I've never seen that before.

465
00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:35.859
That's not mine. I swear.

466
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.860
What did you do?

467
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:38.514
-Nothing. Mom.
-That is your purse.

468
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:41.125
Somebody must
have put that there.

469
00:21:41.256 --> 00:21:43.998
Faye. it's not hers.

470
00:21:44.128 --> 00:21:45.826
This must be some
kind of mistake.

471
00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.787
I'm sorry. but you two are
officially disqualified.

472
00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:52.789
Our contestants are
supposed to be role models

473
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.051
to this community.

474
00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:55.662
Mom. this is not fair.

475
00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:57.054
Those drugs are not even mine.

476
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:58.012
That is enough.

477
00:21:59.927 --> 00:22:01.755
-Faye.
-Patrice. I can't.

478
00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:08.196
I know. I can't believe
that about Vivienne.

479
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.676
I've been doing pageants
with her forever.

480
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:13.027
Well. call me later. okay?

481
00:22:13.157 --> 00:22:13.941
Okay. I will.

482
00:22:14.071 --> 00:22:15.246
Sweet.

483
00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.639
Oh. hey. Darcy. since
the girls are planning

484
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.728
to get together. maybe we
can get together sometime?

485
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:20.469
Grab lunch or...

486
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.253
Oh. s-

487
00:22:25.474 --> 00:22:28.259
I'm not sure I can.
I'm really busy.

488
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.522
Just a lot going on.

489
00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:31.350
Oh.

490
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.482
Okay. Well. if you
change your mind.

491
00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:34.875
Yeah. sure.

492
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:36.659
Let's go. Mia.

493
00:22:38.226 --> 00:22:39.053
-Bye.
-Bye.

494
00:22:43.884 --> 00:22:45.755
You're helping the
competition now?

495
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:48.236
What? I can't make friends?

496
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:50.891
You're always hanging
out with Adeline.

497
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:53.546
Get in the car. Mia.

498
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.071
Whatever. Mom.

499
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.383
Okay. nice and tall.
long neck. and go.

500
00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:06.123
Good.

501
00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:07.473
Engage your core.

502
00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:09.344
Don't suck in your stomach
and stick out your ribs.

503
00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:10.737
you look like a linebacker.

504
00:23:12.086 --> 00:23:13.217
Graceful. Honey.
you're clomping.

505
00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:14.523
Mom. I know how to walk.

506
00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:16.525
I won last year. remember?

507
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:18.179
Yeah. thanks to me.

508
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.182
What is that supposed to mean?

509
00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:24.838
I just mean that I
coached you to win.

510
00:23:24.968 --> 00:23:26.013
Honey. I know I
can be hard on you.

511
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:29.277
but that's just because
I see your potential.

512
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:32.019
And we deserve something
good. don't we?

513
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:34.108
After your father left
us for that trashy-

514
00:23:34.238 --> 00:23:36.110
Mom. stop.

515
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.807
Dad didn't leave us for anyone.

516
00:23:37.938 --> 00:23:40.070
He left because you
treated him like garbage.

517
00:23:41.202 --> 00:23:43.030
You don't call or knock?

518
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.249
No. I own this house. I can
come and go as I please.

519
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.469
Ah. my beautiful granddaughter.

520
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.341
Aah. you are a
winner.

521
00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:51.342
Can you tell that to Mom?

522
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:53.432
She thinks I need
to work on my walk.

523
00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:56.347
You're the one who
needs to practice.

524
00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:58.567
You take a break. sweetie.
you're perfection.

525
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:01.178
Hello. Kendra.

526
00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:02.353
Hi. Mrs. Bordeaux.

527
00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:03.267
Good to see you.

528
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:08.055
You don't need to insult me
in front of my own daughter.

529
00:24:08.185 --> 00:24:10.144
You haven't competed
in over 18 years.

530
00:24:10.274 --> 00:24:12.755
and there's some
stiff competition.

531
00:24:12.886 --> 00:24:15.541
Now. with Patrice and
Vivienne out of the pageant.

532
00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:16.977
there are nine
mother-daughter teams left.

533
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:18.761
including you and Lilliana.

534
00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:21.634
I'd keep my eye on these two.

535
00:24:21.764 --> 00:24:22.852
The judges watched
the interviews

536
00:24:22.983 --> 00:24:26.421
and seemed quite interested
in our newcomers.

537
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:28.162
Not afraid of a
little competition.

538
00:24:30.338 --> 00:24:33.080
I watched for years as you lost

539
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.517
every single pageant
I put you in.

540
00:24:35.648 --> 00:24:38.825
That's because you
were afraid and weak.

541
00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:41.654
I'm not sure that's
changed at all.

542
00:24:55.798 --> 00:24:58.061
Okay. here we go.

543
00:24:58.192 --> 00:24:59.802
Shoulders back.

544
00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:02.239
Yep. Head. a little higher.

545
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.764
Higher.

546
00:25:04.894 --> 00:25:06.548
I know it feels unnatural.
but the judges love it.

547
00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:07.244
Yeah.

548
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:08.376
Okay. here we go.

549
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:09.769
Mm-hmm.

550
00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:10.683
Good.

551
00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:14.382
Look. thank you so
much for helping me.

552
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.210
especially since
you're competition.

553
00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:19.866
I'm not exactly trying to win.

554
00:25:22.912 --> 00:25:23.739
Why is that?

555
00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:26.525
You have to promise
not to tell anybody.

556
00:25:28.352 --> 00:25:29.092
I won't.

557
00:25:32.182 --> 00:25:33.880
I caught my mom
cheating on my dad.

558
00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:36.535
Oh my God.

559
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.450
Yeah.

560
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:42.410
And I can't tell my dad.
even though I want to.

561
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:45.239
but it would break
him. you know?

562
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:49.896
So. I'm going to get back at
my mom in a different way.

563
00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:54.378
How?

564
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.338
If there's anything my mom loves

565
00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:59.427
in this world. it's pageants.

566
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.995
When she found out this one
was for mothers and daughters.

567
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:04.519
I'd literally never
seen her so happy.

568
00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.697
But after what she did to my
dad. I just can't help her win.

569
00:26:08.828 --> 00:26:11.178
Oh. you're going to
throw the competition?

570
00:26:11.308 --> 00:26:13.093
Mm-hmm.

571
00:26:13.223 --> 00:26:15.791
But I'm gonna wait
till the next cut.

572
00:26:15.922 --> 00:26:19.316
Let us get to the final five.
where she can almost touch

573
00:26:19.447 --> 00:26:23.277
the crown. and then
make it all go away.

574
00:26:26.715 --> 00:26:29.892
Wow. that probably
sounds really crazy. right?

575
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:31.894
Hey. I don't judge

576
00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:36.420
And that's why I like you.

577
00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:37.857
And why I want you to win.

578
00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:41.295
Okay. so what are you
wearing to the next event?

579
00:26:42.252 --> 00:26:43.036
I don't know.

580
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:43.950
Uh...

581
00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:49.608
This is probably the
dressiest thing I own.

582
00:26:49.738 --> 00:26:53.089
No. no. you can't
wear that.

583
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.571
Um. there is a local boutique
that sponsors the pageant.

584
00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:57.964
They send over a
bunch of dresses

585
00:26:58.094 --> 00:26:59.356
to the contestants every year.

586
00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:00.488
so you should call Faye.

587
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:01.881
She'll let you know when you

588
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:03.622
can drop by pageant
headquarters and try some on.

589
00:27:05.014 --> 00:27:06.102
Cool. thanks.

590
00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:07.582
You're welcome.

591
00:27:07.713 --> 00:27:08.409
Yeah. probably a good call.

592
00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:10.367
Yeah. don't. don't wear that.

593
00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:17.505
Hm.

594
00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.986
Mm.

595
00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:23.903
Ah. you look so pretty. Mom.

596
00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:25.339
Oh. thanks. honey.

597
00:27:26.775 --> 00:27:30.692
Mm. I don't like the
way the dress fits me.

598
00:27:30.823 --> 00:27:31.519
No?

599
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:32.825
No.

600
00:27:32.955 --> 00:27:34.348
I think I'm gonna just
try a different one on.

601
00:27:34.478 --> 00:27:35.654
Okay.

602
00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:42.965
What's wrong?

603
00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:45.664
The deposit is overdue for
the literature residency.

604
00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:47.404
I already asked
for an extension.

605
00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:49.493
but since they have a wait-list.

606
00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:51.234
they don't wanna be flexible.

607
00:27:51.365 --> 00:27:52.801
I'll give them a call and
see if there's something

608
00:27:52.932 --> 00:27:55.238
we can work out. okay?

609
00:27:55.369 --> 00:27:56.805
Yeah. Thanks. Mom.

610
00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:07.468
Oh. Emilia.

611
00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:09.165
I'm sorry. Faye
gave me this time.

612
00:28:09.296 --> 00:28:11.254
She didn't mention anybody
else was back here.

613
00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:12.429
Oh. we're just wrapping up.

614
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.040
Oh.

615
00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:18.740
Hmm. that dress
looks amazing on you.

616
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:19.610
Thank you.

617
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:21.569
Looks a little loose though.

618
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.876
Hmm? Feels okay.

619
00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:26.356
Yeah. ideally. you wanted
to accentuate your curves.

620
00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:28.489
Here. let me show you.

621
00:28:32.449 --> 00:28:33.929
Oh yeah. you could take
this in about an inch.

622
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.453
-Ouch!
-Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

623
00:28:36.584 --> 00:28:37.803
You okay. Mom?

624
00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:40.196
I was just making some
tailoring suggestions.

625
00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:41.850
-Ugh.
-See?

626
00:28:41.981 --> 00:28:43.417
But you don't look so wide.

627
00:28:45.636 --> 00:28:46.812
-Hm.
-Yeah.

628
00:28:46.942 --> 00:28:48.901
It's good. right?

629
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:53.079
But I don't understand.

630
00:28:54.384 --> 00:28:55.559
Hey. Mom. do you think
these earrings would go

631
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.213
with the dress I got.

632
00:28:57.344 --> 00:28:58.301
Section
two. paragraph five.

633
00:28:58.432 --> 00:29:00.695
Is there any way I can
appeal the decision?

634
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:01.391
Yes. you can reach out

635
00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:02.305
to Mr. Ginley personally.

636
00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:04.090
Okay.

637
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.613
Sure. I'll try
giving him a call.

638
00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:11.053
What's wrong?

639
00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:13.055
I just found out that
insurance may not cover

640
00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:14.753
the damages at the spa.

641
00:29:14.883 --> 00:29:16.189
I can try to appeal
the decision.

642
00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:19.279
but that'll take time and
delay the opening even longer.

643
00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:22.673
Or we could win the pageant

644
00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:25.502
and you'll have all
the money you'll need.

645
00:29:25.633 --> 00:29:27.287
I love your optimism. honey.

646
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.464
Are these worthy of a crown?

647
00:29:30.594 --> 00:29:32.466
Hm? Yes.

648
00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:33.859
No.

649
00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:35.730
Okay. maybe I'll go back
to the drawing board.

650
00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:38.559
You are worthy of the crown.

651
00:29:38.689 --> 00:29:40.082
-Come here.
-Aw.

652
00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:40.953
I love you.

653
00:29:41.823 --> 00:29:43.042
Now put 'em on.

654
00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:43.738
Okay.

655
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.482
♪ Ah ha

656
00:29:48.612 --> 00:29:51.572

660
00:29:59.058 --> 00:30:01.103
Hey. Sophie and Emilia.

661
00:30:01.234 --> 00:30:03.192
Come on. you two. let me show
you where to put your stuff.

662
00:30:03.323 --> 00:30:04.150
Thanks.

663
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:08.328
We've got a big day ahead.
so I hope you're ready.

664
00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:12.854
You can hang your
dresses up here.

665
00:30:12.985 --> 00:30:14.116
-Mm-hmm.
-Things down over here.

666
00:30:14.247 --> 00:30:15.901
Changing room's upstairs.

667
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:18.164
Come on. I want you to
meet Rebecca Bordeaux.

668
00:30:19.382 --> 00:30:20.514
-Okay.
-Okay.

669
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:28.756
Hey.

670
00:31:30.627 --> 00:31:32.412
Hey. here you are.
Where have you been?

671
00:31:32.542 --> 00:31:33.761
I've been looking
all over for you.

672
00:31:34.762 --> 00:31:36.242
I had something to take care of.

673
00:31:36.372 --> 00:31:39.593
Ladies! Ladies!

674
00:31:39.723 --> 00:31:42.988
Everyone. we have a very
special guest joining us today.

675
00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:44.467
Rebecca Bordeaux!

676
00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:53.650
Rebecca is one of our
biggest supporters.

677
00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:56.436
and we are thrilled
to have her with us.

678
00:31:56.566 --> 00:31:58.525
She generously connected
us to the owners

679
00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:00.570
of this beautiful
space who lent it to us

680
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:02.311
for the pageant this year.

681
00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:07.316
And she secured all donors
for the $100.000 prize.

682
00:32:09.492 --> 00:32:11.233
Oh.

683
00:32:11.364 --> 00:32:12.713
Hello and welcome. everyone.

684
00:32:12.843 --> 00:32:17.109
to this first ever regional
Atlanta mother-daughter pageant.

685
00:32:18.414 --> 00:32:20.025
I want you all to
know that everyone

686
00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:21.896
is given a fair
opportunity to win.

687
00:32:22.027 --> 00:32:24.725
I have no say in the
outcome of this pageant.

688
00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:28.163
Now. some of you are more
seasoned with many titles.

689
00:32:28.294 --> 00:32:31.166
and others are here
for their first try.

690
00:32:31.297 --> 00:32:35.301
And others have competed many
times and haven't won yet.

691
00:32:36.867 --> 00:32:40.436
The strongest contestants.
the ones who get the crown.

692
00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:43.874
focus on their own strengths.

693
00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:46.225
I wish you all the
very best of luck.

694
00:32:46.355 --> 00:32:48.183
Hm. I love you all.

695
00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:06.158
Oh my God. it's ruined.

696
00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:09.204
Who would do this?

697
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:14.079
It looks like somebody took a
pair of scissors to my gown.

698
00:33:14.209 --> 00:33:15.906
-That's really terrible.
-Oh my gosh.

699
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:18.866
-It wasn't me.
-No one's gonna fess up?

700
00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:28.093
Emilia had a pair of
scissors in her purse.

701
00:33:28.223 --> 00:33:29.007
What?

702
00:33:29.137 --> 00:33:30.660
I. I absolutely did not do that.

703
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:32.314
How dare you accuse me?

704
00:33:32.445 --> 00:33:34.708
Who do you think you are?

705
00:33:34.838 --> 00:33:36.753
What is all the
commotion back here?

706
00:33:36.884 --> 00:33:38.190
My dress.

707
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.627
Somebody in this
room destroyed it.

708
00:33:40.757 --> 00:33:42.759
Well. before we start throwing
accusations. let's think-

709
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.371
Faye. let me talk
with my daughter.

710
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:46.198
Adeline.

711
00:33:47.634 --> 00:33:48.765
-What?
-Come here.

712
00:33:48.896 --> 00:33:50.550
What?

713
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.813
Faye. I am not
responsible for this.

714
00:33:52.943 --> 00:33:54.554
Don't worry. we'll
figure this out.

715
00:34:00.516 --> 00:34:03.258
Mother! What the
hell are you doing?

716
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:05.304
I could ask you
the same question.

717
00:34:05.434 --> 00:34:06.957
I know what you're
up to. Adeline.

718
00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:09.047
You're trying to chip
off your competition.

719
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:11.397
That Emilia woman. she
just shredded my gown.

720
00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:12.398
You are accusing me?

721
00:34:12.527 --> 00:34:13.399
I take it you didn't
know that there

722
00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:15.226
were security
cameras back there.

723
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.621
There's no cameras
in the dressing room.

724
00:34:18.752 --> 00:34:22.234
Of course not. but there
are in the makeup area.

725
00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:23.757
where the dresses are hanging.

726
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:27.065
You're lucky I am
the one who secured

727
00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:28.239
this space for the pageant.

728
00:34:29.502 --> 00:34:31.373
Now. do I need to
go to the office

729
00:34:31.504 --> 00:34:35.116
and rewind the footage to
see what really happened?

730
00:34:35.246 --> 00:34:36.944
Or would you rather
I just erase it?

731
00:34:40.252 --> 00:34:40.904
Hm?

732
00:34:41.034 --> 00:34:42.819
That's what I thought.

733
00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.516
I have a reputation to protect.

734
00:34:44.647 --> 00:34:47.085
and that's the only reason I'm
getting you out of this mess.

735
00:34:47.215 --> 00:34:48.824
You will not put shame
on this family legacy.

736
00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:49.783
do you hear me?

737
00:34:51.263 --> 00:34:53.178
Now. you're gonna
go back in there

738
00:34:53.308 --> 00:34:55.527
and tell everyone
you made a mistake.

739
00:34:55.658 --> 00:34:58.748
Tell them. tell them you
fired your housekeeper

740
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:00.620
this morning and
before you left.

741
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.317
she retaliated by
shredding your gown.

742
00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:03.449
No.

743
00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:05.712
No. Mother. no.
Nobody's gonna buy that.

744
00:35:05.842 --> 00:35:08.149
Th- there's a piece of my dress
stuck on Emilia's scissors.

745
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.108
This is not up for debate.

746
00:35:11.805 --> 00:35:13.023
-Go.
-Oh my God.

747
00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:19.291
Ladies. I apologize.

748
00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:21.597
I made the wrong assumption.

749
00:35:21.728 --> 00:35:26.036
Unfortunately. I had to let my
housekeeper go earlier today

750
00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:30.432
and I had no idea she
would be this vindictive.

751
00:35:30.563 --> 00:35:32.739
I'm just glad you figured
out what happened.

752
00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:34.436
Do you have somethin'
else to wear?

753
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:36.656
Rosewood Boutique is gonna
rush me over a new gown.

754
00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:37.613
Perfect.

755
00:35:37.744 --> 00:35:39.615
Now that we have
that cleared up.

756
00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:41.095
the judges are on their way in.

757
00:35:41.226 --> 00:35:44.446
Please. everyone. get ready
and meet me in the main room.

758
00:35:44.577 --> 00:35:46.622
We start in half an hour.

759
00:35:46.753 --> 00:35:48.711
Mom. there is no way Kendra
would destroy your dress.

760
00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:51.279
Lilliana. I don't need
your input right now.

761
00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:04.249
You're gonna do fine. honey.

762
00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:06.599
If anyone should be
nervous. it's me.

763
00:36:06.729 --> 00:36:08.862
I haven't done this
piece in almost 10 years.

764
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.952
You're gonna do great.

765
00:36:12.082 --> 00:36:13.171
Thank you. honey.

766
00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.827
Everyone. please gather around.

767
00:36:21.004 --> 00:36:23.616
I am pleased to
introduce our judges.

768
00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:26.619
Let's give a warm round of
applause for Cyrus Price.

769
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:29.752
Franklin Davis.

770
00:36:32.886 --> 00:36:34.409
And Vanessa Handler.

771
00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:38.196
Thank you.

772
00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:43.288
The judges have watched
your interview tape.

773
00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:45.028
Today they are going
to watch you perform

774
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:47.640
for the preliminary competition.

775
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.991
After. they're going to decide
on the final five pairs.

776
00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:53.167
Lilliana. you're up first.

777
00:37:42.303 --> 00:37:43.565

You're gonna do great.

800
00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:49.082
Uh?

801
00:39:50.649 --> 00:39:51.345
What's wrong. honey?

802
00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:54.392
My poem. it. it. was right here.

803
00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:56.394
It's gotta be down
here somewhere.

804
00:39:57.612 --> 00:39:58.613
It's gone.

805
00:39:58.744 --> 00:40:00.093
I...

806
00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:02.791
Hey. hey. hey. look.
you've got this.

807
00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:04.663
You've got this many times.

808
00:40:04.793 --> 00:40:05.925
You wrote it.

809
00:40:06.055 --> 00:40:07.622
Deep breath.

810
00:40:07.753 --> 00:40:08.406
Go get 'em.

811
00:40:21.462 --> 00:40:23.943
This is a poem I
wrote for my father.

812
00:40:26.641 --> 00:40:31.298
"Lightly they pass.
lifting the mist.

813
00:40:32.386 --> 00:40:34.040
Burying a golden leaf.

814
00:40:37.652 --> 00:40:39.132
Color no longer green."

815
00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:45.530
Um...

816
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:50.709
The...

817
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.014
Um...

818
00:40:52.145 --> 00:40:56.018
I'm sorry. I. um. I
had a copy of my poem.

819
00:40:56.149 --> 00:40:57.106
but I must have misplaced it.

820
00:40:57.237 --> 00:40:59.326
It's okay. you're fine.

821
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.154
If you qualify for
the next round.

822
00:41:01.284 --> 00:41:04.026
just bring an extra copy with
you at the pageant final.

823
00:41:04.157 --> 00:41:04.984
It's gonna be okay.

824
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.901
It's okay.

825
00:41:15.951 --> 00:41:17.039
I think I just
ruined our chances.

826
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.259
No. you did not.

827
00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:20.478
You're okay.

828
00:41:20.608 --> 00:41:21.653
I just need some air.

829
00:41:43.588 --> 00:41:44.893
Sophie.

830
00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:46.939
Seriously. do not sweat that.

831
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:48.897
I just blew it in there.

832
00:41:49.028 --> 00:41:51.204
Look. don't
worry about it. okay?

833
00:41:51.334 --> 00:41:53.032
They're picking the
final five today.

834
00:41:53.162 --> 00:41:55.861
Sophie. anything can
happen. Trust me.

835
00:41:57.384 --> 00:41:59.212
Are you going to the pageant
sleepover tomorrow night?

836
00:42:00.126 --> 00:42:01.910
I didn't even know about it.

837
00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:04.696
Tatum. She always tries to
leave the new girls out.

838
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:06.959
It's at her house. her
parents are really rich.

839
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:08.351
It's actually kinda fun.

840
00:42:09.701 --> 00:42:12.660
Okay. yeah. I'll go.
unless I get cut today.

841
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:15.184
Sophie. it's not just
for the final five.

842
00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:16.925
Come on. they're about
to announce the winners.

843
00:42:17.056 --> 00:42:17.970
Okay.

844
00:42:20.668 --> 00:42:25.194
Moving ahead in the competition
are Mackenzie and Tatum.

845
00:42:25.325 --> 00:42:27.936
Ah! Oh my God.

846
00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:29.242
We got this.

847
00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:31.592
Darcy and Mia.

848
00:42:33.594 --> 00:42:35.335
Roberta and Scarlett.

849
00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:40.383
Adeline and Lilliana.

850
00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:42.734
Yes! I told you. honey.

851
00:42:44.997 --> 00:42:48.174
And finally. Emilia and Sophie.

852
00:42:48.304 --> 00:42:49.784
Oh my God.

853
00:42:49.915 --> 00:42:51.525
This is great.

854
00:42:51.656 --> 00:42:52.439
We did it!

855
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.311
-Yeah.
-We did it.

856
00:42:55.442 --> 00:42:56.791
Congratulations.

857
00:42:56.922 --> 00:42:59.098
Let's give a warm
round of applause

858
00:42:59.228 --> 00:43:02.014
to our five
mother-daughter finalists.

859
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.543
What have I been telling you?

860
00:43:09.674 --> 00:43:11.850
Emilia and her daughter
are a real threat.

861
00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.895
I hear you. Mother.

862
00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:15.114
You better step things up.

863
00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:26.386
Emilia Connors. you
are one impressive violinist.

864
00:43:26.516 --> 00:43:27.909
Oh. thank you.

865
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.824
You look familiar.

866
00:43:29.955 --> 00:43:33.001
Were you a vendor at the town
Christmas market last year?

867
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:34.350
Yes. I was.

868
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:37.397
I bought a basket from
you. a gift for my ma.

869
00:43:37.527 --> 00:43:38.137
Some spa products.

870
00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:40.400
-Mm.
-She loved them.

871
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.619
You know. you should really
think about opening up

872
00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:42.794
a place here in town.

873
00:43:42.924 --> 00:43:44.796
I am opening a spa. actually.

874
00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:46.406
Hopefully. within
the next six weeks.

875
00:43:46.536 --> 00:43:47.494
That's great.

876
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:49.801
You know. I've
been watching you.

877
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:52.107
Oh?

878
00:43:52.238 --> 00:43:54.283
Oh. that came out wrong.

879
00:43:54.414 --> 00:43:55.328
I mean. in the pageant.

880
00:43:55.458 --> 00:43:56.546
Mm.

881
00:43:56.677 --> 00:43:59.288
It's just refreshing
to have contestants

882
00:43:59.419 --> 00:44:01.813
who aren't so rehearsed.
you know what I mean?

883
00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:05.381
I think I do. and thank you.

884
00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:12.606
Ugh.

885
00:44:12.737 --> 00:44:14.913
What does Cyrus even
see in Emilia anyway?

886
00:44:15.043 --> 00:44:16.871
She's so plain.

887
00:44:17.002 --> 00:44:20.483
And her violin
skills. hm. not great.

888
00:44:20.614 --> 00:44:23.878
She's opening up a spa.
but have you seen her skin?

889
00:44:24.009 --> 00:44:26.751
She looks 10 years
older than she is.

890
00:44:26.881 --> 00:44:29.144
I have to do something
before the judge's luncheon.

891
00:44:29.275 --> 00:44:33.018
I can't risk them spending
any more time together.

892
00:44:33.148 --> 00:44:35.455
I need to solve this
problem on my own.

893
00:44:35.585 --> 00:44:37.022
What do you mean?

894
00:44:37.152 --> 00:44:38.980
I have to get Cyrus
to vote for me.

895
00:44:39.111 --> 00:44:39.851
How?

896
00:44:41.113 --> 00:44:43.071
I have my ways.

897
00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:46.684
You're not gonna do anything
to Emilia or Sophie.

898
00:44:46.814 --> 00:44:47.946
-Adeline. I can't
-Enough.

899
00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:52.080
Darcy. stop your blabbering.
I need your help.

900
00:44:52.211 --> 00:44:54.561
You're still a member of
Seasons Country Club. right?

901
00:44:55.388 --> 00:44:57.390
Y- yes.

902
00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.045
The manager is an
old college friend.

903
00:45:00.175 --> 00:45:01.133
I invited you to
check it out. but you-

904
00:45:01.263 --> 00:45:03.613
I didn't care about
that tacky place then.

905
00:45:03.744 --> 00:45:06.094
but I did some research
and I found out

906
00:45:06.225 --> 00:45:09.097
that Cyrus plays pickleball
there with a friend.

907
00:45:09.228 --> 00:45:11.012
And you can get me
in as a guest. right?

908
00:45:12.187 --> 00:45:13.449
Yes.

909
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.494
Good.

910
00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:33.295
Oh!

911
00:45:33.426 --> 00:45:34.253
Mm!

912
00:45:34.993 --> 00:45:36.255
I think I need a break.

913
00:45:36.385 --> 00:45:37.212
Hm.

914
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:40.128
Oh. Get over here.

915
00:45:43.088 --> 00:45:44.306
Cyrus.

916
00:45:44.437 --> 00:45:46.308
Oh. hello. Adeline.

917
00:45:46.439 --> 00:45:48.528
Well. I didn't know
you were a member here.

918
00:45:48.658 --> 00:45:50.922
Yes. I enjoy it here. um.

919
00:45:51.052 --> 00:45:52.706
it's less stuffy than the
other clubs around the area.

920
00:45:52.837 --> 00:45:53.576
Are you a member?

921
00:45:53.707 --> 00:45:54.621
Oh. I'm thinking about joining.

922
00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:56.188
-Oh.
-But I came along with Darcy.

923
00:45:56.318 --> 00:45:57.276
Hmm. That's nice.

924
00:45:57.406 --> 00:45:58.712
Hello.

925
00:45:58.843 --> 00:46:00.235
Can we interest
you guys in a game?

926
00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:02.498
I appreciate the offer.

927
00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:05.284
but. uh. I had knee
surgery earlier this year.

928
00:46:05.414 --> 00:46:06.633
Yeah. I gotta take
it easy for now.

929
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.940
-Mm.
-Well. we understand.

930
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.506
Well. we're gonna
go grab a drink.

931
00:46:10.637 --> 00:46:11.594
Nice to see you.

932
00:46:11.725 --> 00:46:12.508
-Okay.
-Nice meeting you.

933
00:46:12.639 --> 00:46:13.988
-Bye.
-Bye-Bye.

934
00:46:15.729 --> 00:46:17.339
Perfect. He's getting a drink.

935
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.124
Good. I could really
use a glass of wine.

936
00:46:19.254 --> 00:46:21.169
No. I gotta do this alone.

937
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.998
I. I can't risk. like.
your distractions.

938
00:46:24.129 --> 00:46:26.827
Oh. um. well. I
guess I could go-

939
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:29.047
Talk to a manager of the club.

940
00:46:29.177 --> 00:46:30.526
Yes. Why?

941
00:46:30.657 --> 00:46:33.225
'Cause you won't stop
bragging that you know him.

942
00:46:33.355 --> 00:46:36.010
My God. are you
sleeping with him too?

943
00:46:36.141 --> 00:46:37.316
Don't.

944
00:46:37.446 --> 00:46:38.317
No!

945
00:46:39.535 --> 00:46:40.885
Do whatever you
want. just don't get

946
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:42.103
in the way of my plan.

947
00:46:49.197 --> 00:46:50.459
We meet again.

948
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.939
Do you mind if I take a seat?

949
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.768
Uh. sure. Where's Darcy?

950
00:46:54.899 --> 00:46:57.727
Oh. she's off yapping to
the manager of the club.

951
00:46:57.858 --> 00:47:00.426
and apparently they're
old friends from college.

952
00:47:00.556 --> 00:47:02.036
So. what are we drinking?

953
00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:03.516
Uh. whiskey. neat.

954
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:06.171
Sounds delicious.

955
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.352
So. how are you enjoying
the pageant so far?

956
00:47:13.482 --> 00:47:15.397
You know what? I think
it's going great.

957
00:47:15.528 --> 00:47:18.183
There are some really
impressive contestants.

958
00:47:18.313 --> 00:47:19.401
Hmm. that's good to hear.

959
00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:22.056
Mm-hmm.

960
00:47:22.187 --> 00:47:23.014
You know. pageants
have been around

961
00:47:23.144 --> 00:47:25.451
for a very long
time in my family.

962
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:26.756
My mother was Miss Teen-

963
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:28.802
Oh. I'm aware of
who your mother is.

964
00:47:28.933 --> 00:47:32.980
She's a legend. So
many crowns.

965
00:47:37.463 --> 00:47:39.421
What's a girl got to do to
get a drink around here?

966
00:47:39.552 --> 00:47:41.380
Oh. you know. I think
she'll be right back.

967
00:47:42.381 --> 00:47:44.209
You mind if I take
a sip of yours?

968
00:47:45.253 --> 00:47:46.602
Uh. sure.

969
00:47:50.998 --> 00:47:51.738
Hmm.

970
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:56.525
You know. I think it's
a great group this year.

971
00:47:57.918 --> 00:48:00.181
There's a lot of very
experienced contestants.

972
00:48:00.312 --> 00:48:01.400
Me.

973
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.881
And those new to the
competition as well.

974
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:07.754
Yes. Emilia and
Sophie.

975
00:48:10.104 --> 00:48:12.585
Huh. it's nice to have
newcomers. don't you think?

976
00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:14.848
You know. I wouldn't
have imagined

977
00:48:14.979 --> 00:48:17.503
that they're new to
pageant competitions.

978
00:48:17.633 --> 00:48:21.072
One thing I can say. it is
a very tight race so far.

979
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.254
Enough shoptalk. how
about another round. hm?

980
00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:43.007
Girls. I am so happy
to have you all here

981
00:48:43.137 --> 00:48:45.923
for my annual pageant
sleepover.

982
00:48:46.053 --> 00:48:47.185
Yes!

983
00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:49.970
Now. everyone in here has
made it to the top five.

984
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:54.192
But let's face it. no matter
who wins. we are all winners.

985
00:48:54.322 --> 00:48:56.194
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo!

986
00:48:56.324 --> 00:48:57.325
Anyway.
let's go ahead

987
00:48:57.456 --> 00:48:59.545
and drink up before
my parents get home

988
00:48:59.675 --> 00:49:01.155
and we get caught
drinking their booze.

989
00:49:01.286 --> 00:49:02.113
Yeah. we should.

990
00:49:03.418 --> 00:49:04.854
Cheers.

991
00:49:04.985 --> 00:49:07.292
Here's to watching
our mothers try

992
00:49:07.422 --> 00:49:10.991
to recapture their youth and
not go absolutely insane.

993
00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:12.819
-Cheers to survive.
-Cheers.

994
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:15.300
Yes!

995
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.171
Yes!

996
00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:19.391
Thank you for agreeing
to show me around.

997
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:21.915
I think I'm gonna get a
membership here after all.

998
00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:23.134
Well. maybe next time
I'll take you up on

999
00:49:23.264 --> 00:49:25.266
that pickleball match.

1000
00:49:25.397 --> 00:49:26.441
I'm gonna hold you to it.

1001
00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:31.055
Well. it's getting late.

1002
00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.274
Oh. are you heading
home so soon?

1003
00:49:33.405 --> 00:49:35.276
Adeline. what are you doing?

1004
00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:36.321
Well. the night is still young.

1005
00:49:36.451 --> 00:49:37.452
Adeline!

1006
00:49:39.324 --> 00:49:40.716
I think we both have interests

1007
00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.153
that could benefit one another.

1008
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:45.156
Are you trying to bribe me?

1009
00:49:46.374 --> 00:49:47.245
Because if you are.
you should know

1010
00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:49.725
that's an automatic
disqualification.

1011
00:49:49.856 --> 00:49:52.467
Wait. this is
a big misunderstanding.

1012
00:49:52.598 --> 00:49:54.774
No. I. I don't think it is.

1013
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:57.168
I mean. can't you tell
when you're barking up

1014
00:49:57.298 --> 00:49:58.952
the wrong tree. Adeline?

1015
00:49:59.083 --> 00:50:01.476
I'm sorry. but the
rules are the rules.

1016
00:50:01.607 --> 00:50:03.043
I'm gonna have to report this.

1017
00:50:03.174 --> 00:50:04.349
What? You're gonna report this?

1018
00:50:04.479 --> 00:50:05.263
Yes.

1019
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:10.355
Do you really think that I need

1020
00:50:10.485 --> 00:50:12.879
to proposition a
judge in order to win?

1021
00:50:13.749 --> 00:50:15.273
Do you know who I am?

1022
00:50:15.403 --> 00:50:16.361
I do.

1023
00:50:16.491 --> 00:50:18.363
You're Rebecca
Bordeaux's daughter.

1024
00:50:18.493 --> 00:50:20.713
and that does not
make you untouchable.

1025
00:50:20.843 --> 00:50:23.281
Oh.

1026
00:50:23.411 --> 00:50:24.978
-Adeline?
-Cyrus.

1027
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:26.240
-Adeline?
-Cyrus.

1028
00:50:26.371 --> 00:50:27.154
Adeline?

1029
00:50:27.285 --> 00:50:29.200
-I'm very touchable.
-Adeline?

1030
00:50:31.419 --> 00:50:32.377
Touch.

1031
00:50:46.652 --> 00:50:49.046
Hey. Dad. I got your message.

1032
00:50:49.176 --> 00:50:51.048
I really wish I could
fly out and see you.

1033
00:50:51.178 --> 00:50:55.269
but with all this pageant
stuff. Mom would kill me.

1034
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.662
But thank you for the invite.

1035
00:50:56.792 --> 00:50:58.925
and I really hope I see you
when you're back in town.

1036
00:50:59.056 --> 00:50:59.882
Love you.

1037
00:51:01.928 --> 00:51:03.234
Hey.

1038
00:51:03.364 --> 00:51:04.365
Hey.

1039
00:51:04.496 --> 00:51:05.671
Are you okay?

1040
00:51:05.801 --> 00:51:07.586
Yeah. it's just. um...

1041
00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.893
Do you wanna talk about it?

1042
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:14.375
It's my dad's
birthday this week.

1043
00:51:14.506 --> 00:51:16.160
and he's in Montreal for work.

1044
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.293
He works at this.
like. big tech company.

1045
00:51:19.424 --> 00:51:21.600
but he was gonna fly
me out and sightsee

1046
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:23.428
and get dinner and
all of that stuff.

1047
00:51:23.558 --> 00:51:24.429
That's so cool.

1048
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:27.171
Yeah. but. I mean.
I'm not going.

1049
00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:29.260
Because of the pageant.

1050
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.392
It would be a quick trip.
and it doesn't interfere

1051
00:51:31.523 --> 00:51:35.092
with any of the events. but
my mom would. like. freak out.

1052
00:51:35.222 --> 00:51:37.442
It's like any time I wanna
spend time with my dad

1053
00:51:37.572 --> 00:51:40.053
it just ends up in. like.
a screaming match with her.

1054
00:51:41.576 --> 00:51:44.536
She doesn't want you to
spend time with him at all?

1055
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:46.668
It must be hard on you.

1056
00:51:46.799 --> 00:51:48.366
I'm just trying to keep the
peace until I can graduate

1057
00:51:48.496 --> 00:51:50.107
and get the hell outta here.

1058
00:51:50.237 --> 00:51:53.197
Well. is he at least coming
to the pageant final?

1059
00:51:53.327 --> 00:51:55.112
No. that's my mom's turf.

1060
00:51:56.461 --> 00:51:57.984
But. we should head back inside.

1061
00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.988
Yeah.

1062
00:52:08.516 --> 00:52:10.301
Darcy seems
very distracted.

1063
00:52:11.215 --> 00:52:12.303
What's that all about?

1064
00:52:14.043 --> 00:52:16.176
I don't know.

1065
00:52:16.307 --> 00:52:18.135
Shame about what
happened to that judge.

1066
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:21.442
Yeah.

1067
00:52:21.573 --> 00:52:23.314
I got word before he died
that he was quite fond

1068
00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:24.315
of Emilia and Sophie.

1069
00:52:25.707 --> 00:52:26.795
Pity for them.

1070
00:52:26.926 --> 00:52:28.145
But lucky break for you.

1071
00:52:29.755 --> 00:52:33.846
I don't need a judge to die
in order to win. Mother.

1072
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:37.502
But now that he's taken care of.

1073
00:52:39.286 --> 00:52:41.158
That's an odd way to phrase it.

1074
00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:45.597
I just mean that if
he so clearly favored

1075
00:52:45.727 --> 00:52:49.383
certain contestants. the
playing field's open again.

1076
00:52:50.515 --> 00:52:52.386
And you want
Lilliana and I to win

1077
00:52:52.517 --> 00:52:55.084
more than anything.
right. Mother?

1078
00:53:03.092 --> 00:53:04.006
Hello. Faye.

1079
00:53:05.704 --> 00:53:07.401
Adeline. I just got
back into the office

1080
00:53:07.532 --> 00:53:09.621
and now is not the best time.

1081
00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:11.579
This will only
take a few moments.

1082
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.147
I wanted to discuss the
appointments of the new judge.

1083
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.543
A man just died. Adeline.
have some compassion.

1084
00:53:18.673 --> 00:53:21.720
I'm working on finding
a new replacement.

1085
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.984
It just so happens I have
someone you should consider.

1086
00:53:25.114 --> 00:53:26.507
His name is Warren Sandler.

1087
00:53:26.638 --> 00:53:28.640
He's an upstanding businessman.

1088
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.643
on the board of several
organizations here in Atlanta.

1089
00:53:31.773 --> 00:53:33.427
You know him?

1090
00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:34.385
Um...

1091
00:53:43.307 --> 00:53:45.526
We support a few of
the same charities.

1092
00:53:45.657 --> 00:53:48.355
As you know. I'm very
involved in the community.

1093
00:53:48.486 --> 00:53:50.009
It would be a conflict of
interest to appoint a judge

1094
00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:51.793
that you know personally.

1095
00:53:51.924 --> 00:53:54.405
Besides. I have a few
people in mind already.

1096
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:57.843
My mother's a big fan of Warren.

1097
00:53:57.973 --> 00:54:00.541
and between you and I. she's
planning to secure double

1098
00:54:00.672 --> 00:54:02.543
the funding for next year.

1099
00:54:02.674 --> 00:54:03.936
I don't want to tell
you how to do your job.

1100
00:54:04.066 --> 00:54:06.852
but I'm sure it
would go a long way

1101
00:54:06.982 --> 00:54:10.159
if you appoint the
judge that she wants.

1102
00:54:14.207 --> 00:54:17.819
Faye called. she said that
they selected a new judge.

1103
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.256
Warren Sandler.

1104
00:54:20.822 --> 00:54:22.520
Interesting choice.

1105
00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:26.741
Careful with that. dear.
Caffeine gives you cellulite.

1106
00:54:29.657 --> 00:54:30.919
Faye was acting as if
I would be thrilled

1107
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.965
with her selection of Warren.

1108
00:54:33.095 --> 00:54:35.359
Do you know anything about that?

1109
00:54:35.489 --> 00:54:36.577
No. Mother. I don't.

1110
00:54:41.103 --> 00:54:43.671
Well. I have some
interesting news.

1111
00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:45.804
The pageant hasn't
officially announced it yet.

1112
00:54:45.934 --> 00:54:48.807
but a television crew is coming
to film the dress rehearsal.

1113
00:54:48.937 --> 00:54:50.287
Really?

1114
00:54:50.417 --> 00:54:53.290
Why not
the pageant itself?

1115
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.596
Well. they're doing
it documentary style.

1116
00:54:55.727 --> 00:54:57.859
showing the behind-the-scenes.

1117
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:59.557
Faye will be doing a
presentation highlighting

1118
00:54:59.687 --> 00:55:01.167
my past wins.

1119
00:55:02.777 --> 00:55:04.170
Of course.

1120
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:06.999
All eyes will be on the
legacy I built for our family.

1121
00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:09.349
You understand that?

1122
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.265
What do you expect me to do?

1123
00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:15.181
Prove that you can win
something for once in your life.

1124
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.506
Okay. Franklin is over
there. and Vanessa is there.

1125
00:55:37.072 --> 00:55:38.813
This feels so awkward.

1126
00:55:38.944 --> 00:55:40.598
Like what. are we supposed
to just go over there

1127
00:55:40.728 --> 00:55:41.686
and sell ourselves?

1128
00:55:43.296 --> 00:55:46.168
I think we can just
start with a simple hello.

1129
00:55:46.299 --> 00:55:47.256
We'll do it together.

1130
00:55:47.387 --> 00:55:48.214
Okay.

1131
00:55:49.824 --> 00:55:51.913
So. you ready to
schmooze the judges?

1132
00:55:52.044 --> 00:55:53.437
Not. not really.

1133
00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:55.613
Hey. you'll be great.

1134
00:55:55.743 --> 00:55:58.137
Kind of sad about that
guy. Cyrus. though.

1135
00:55:58.267 --> 00:56:00.661
My parents belong to the same
country club where he died.

1136
00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:04.839
And no surprise that
Adeline's already cozying up

1137
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.537
to the new judge.

1138
00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:08.495
It's a tragedy what
happened with Cyrus.

1139
00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:11.716
but I'm glad something
wonderful could come out of it.

1140
00:56:12.978 --> 00:56:14.632
I'm so excited that
you're the new judge.

1141
00:56:14.762 --> 00:56:16.111
Yeah. me too.

1142
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:17.939
You know you've
already got my vote.

1143
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:20.725
It's the other two
judges I'd worry about.

1144
00:56:20.855 --> 00:56:22.553
What do. what do you mean?

1145
00:56:22.683 --> 00:56:25.077
Well. I had a conversation
with Franklin and Vanessa.

1146
00:56:25.207 --> 00:56:26.339
seems they're both very endeared

1147
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.558
to the newcomers over there.

1148
00:56:35.479 --> 00:56:36.523
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1149
00:56:40.266 --> 00:56:41.093
Vanessa!

1150
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:43.965
-Adeline.
-Hi.

1151
00:56:44.096 --> 00:56:45.619
I'm sorry. I need to make
an important phone call.

1152
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.969
Can we regroup inside in a bit?

1153
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.928
Yeah. I was hoping I
could get you alone.

1154
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.845
All right. I guess I
have a few minutes.

1155
00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.673
I read an article that
you are considering

1156
00:56:55.803 --> 00:56:57.196
a run for local office.

1157
00:56:57.326 --> 00:56:58.719
That's right.

1158
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.679
Well. our family's very active
in supporting candidates.

1159
00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:04.290
In fact. everyone
we've backed has won.

1160
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:06.988
And?

1161
00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:08.903
Well. I'm just
saying we both have

1162
00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:10.427
something we wanna win here.

1163
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.822
You're not attempting to
bribe me. are you. Adeline?

1164
00:57:14.953 --> 00:57:17.956
Oh. no. no. of course not.

1165
00:57:18.086 --> 00:57:19.610
Um. I'm just pointing
out that we both

1166
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.263
have mutual interests.

1167
00:57:22.656 --> 00:57:23.440
Right.

1168
00:57:24.484 --> 00:57:25.442
If you'll excuse me.

1169
00:57:27.748 --> 00:57:29.750
No.

1170
00:57:29.881 --> 00:57:32.884
Aw.

1171
00:57:34.886 --> 00:57:35.756
You know what she said.

1172
00:57:35.887 --> 00:57:37.018
I need you.

1173
00:57:37.149 --> 00:57:38.759
-Ouch. Mom. what the hell?
-Stop fraternizing

1174
00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.196
with your competition and
go impress the judges.

1175
00:57:41.327 --> 00:57:42.154
Come with me.

1176
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:46.332
It's good to see
you again. Franklin.

1177
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:47.899
You remember my
daughter. Lilliana?

1178
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:49.248
Hi. nice to see you.

1179
00:57:49.378 --> 00:57:50.902
Always a pleasure.

1180
00:57:53.992 --> 00:57:55.559
What are you majoring
in next year at college?

1181
00:57:55.689 --> 00:57:56.864
Finance.

1182
00:57:56.995 --> 00:57:59.693
You know. I offer
internships at my company.

1183
00:57:59.824 --> 00:58:00.868
That'd be perfect
for you. honey.

1184
00:58:00.999 --> 00:58:03.088
You guys should
exchange numbers.

1185
00:58:03.218 --> 00:58:06.352
I already have a full
course load. but thank you.

1186
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.659
Well. in case you
change your mind.

1187
00:58:10.661 --> 00:58:13.881
That's my personal
cell number on there.

1188
00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:17.798
-Lilliana.
-Mom.

1189
00:58:17.929 --> 00:58:18.538
What the hell was that?

1190
00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:20.627
He's a prominent businessman.

1191
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:22.673
you'd be lucky to
intern with him.

1192
00:58:22.803 --> 00:58:25.763
You didn't see the way
he was leering at me?

1193
00:58:25.893 --> 00:58:26.894
You're
a pageant girl.

1194
00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:27.852
You parade your body on stage.

1195
00:58:27.982 --> 00:58:29.897
you don't want a
man to look at you?

1196
00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:33.814
Just when I thought you
couldn't get any worse.

1197
00:58:43.998 --> 00:58:45.609
So. how do you think it went?

1198
00:58:45.739 --> 00:58:47.654
That Warren guy was
pretty hard to read.

1199
00:58:47.785 --> 00:58:51.179
and Franklin was
kind of friendly.

1200
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.878
A little too
friendly for my liking.

1201
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:55.488
I know.

1202
00:58:55.619 --> 00:58:57.403
I'm gonna use the
restroom really quick.

1203
00:59:04.192 --> 00:59:05.803
Ooh. here. let me
help you with that.

1204
00:59:05.933 --> 00:59:07.065
Uh-huh.
thank you. thank you.

1205
00:59:07.195 --> 00:59:08.109
Of course.

1206
00:59:09.241 --> 00:59:13.114
Ugh. wow. I'm a bit
of a mess today.

1207
00:59:13.245 --> 00:59:14.246
Is everything okay?

1208
00:59:15.682 --> 00:59:16.988
No.

1209
00:59:17.118 --> 00:59:20.165
My mother is ill and I just
called to check in and...

1210
00:59:20.295 --> 00:59:22.254
But I understand.

1211
00:59:22.384 --> 00:59:25.649
I lost my husband
to cancer recently.

1212
00:59:25.779 --> 00:59:27.520
I remember you mentioned
that during your interview.

1213
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:28.521
I'm so sorry.

1214
00:59:28.652 --> 00:59:29.522
Thank you.

1215
00:59:30.828 --> 00:59:33.395
I think it's nice that
you and your daughter

1216
00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:35.006
are doing this pageant
together for the first time.

1217
00:59:35.136 --> 00:59:37.356
after such a big loss.

1218
00:59:37.486 --> 00:59:38.531
What made you enter?

1219
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:43.014
Truthfully. we really
need the money.

1220
00:59:43.144 --> 00:59:45.973
I'm drowning in medical
bills from my husband.

1221
00:59:46.104 --> 00:59:48.062
I'm a new business owner.
and that takes time to build.

1222
00:59:48.193 --> 00:59:50.891
and my daughter has this
incredible opportunity

1223
00:59:51.022 --> 00:59:53.285
to study in London. but the
cost is just more than...

1224
00:59:55.504 --> 00:59:58.072
I'm. I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be laying this all on you.

1225
00:59:58.203 --> 01:00:00.771
No. no. I completely understand.

1226
01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:03.512
I've had my share financial
issues in the past.

1227
01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:05.166
It's not always easy.

1228
01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:07.516
especially after losing
someone you love.

1229
01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:08.474
Thank you.

1230
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:12.826
Just. I don't understand
why aren't these judges

1231
01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:15.263
so impressed with
Emilia and Sophie?

1232
01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:17.309
Uh. at least Cyrus is gone.

1233
01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.139
Well. that's kind of an
awful thing to say. isn't it?

1234
01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:22.662
The man died.

1235
01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.403
But he wasn't gonna vote for me.

1236
01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:27.624
Adeline. please tell
me you had nothing

1237
01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:28.973
to do with his death.

1238
01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:31.715
Are you accusing me?

1239
01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:34.239
No. no. no. I am sorry.

1240
01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:37.068
I just know how much
you want the crown.

1241
01:00:37.198 --> 01:00:37.764
You're really not
someone who should

1242
01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:40.549
be throwing stones. Darcy.

1243
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.378
What do you mean? I
never hurt anybody.

1244
01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:46.033
Oh. cheating on your
husband isn't hurting him?

1245
01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:49.080
Instead of these accusations.
you should be helping me.

1246
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.429
That's our deal.

1247
01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:51.952
What am I supposed to do?

1248
01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.434
-Is somebody there?
-Shh.

1249
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:03.007
I don't see anybody.

1250
01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.530
Let's get back.
we can talk later.

1251
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:14.192
-Oh. this is cute.
-I love that.

1252
01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:15.410
-Sorry. um.
-Hey.

1253
01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:18.805
Hey. can I talk to you
for a minute in private?

1254
01:01:18.936 --> 01:01:19.806
Yeah. sure.

1255
01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:20.981
-Bye.
-See ya.

1256
01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:23.027
What's up?

1257
01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:26.160
Adeline knows about
your mom's affair.

1258
01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:30.469
Why would she tell her?

1259
01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.950
Adeline is a huge gossip.

1260
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.040
Maybe she didn't and Adeline
found out on her own.

1261
01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:39.608
I heard them arguing
about something.

1262
01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:42.699
said they had a deal.
that she should help her.

1263
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:43.874
Why would she do that?

1264
01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.311
I don't know.

1265
01:01:49.923 --> 01:01:51.185
But you remember how
I said I was going

1266
01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:52.578
to put a stop to all this?

1267
01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:54.972
Perfect timing.

1268
01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:01.065
Right. Yes.

1269
01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:03.110
Mom. can I talk to
you for a second?

1270
01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.459
Honey. why aren't you
out there socializing

1271
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:05.591
with the judges?

1272
01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:08.594
I'll give you two a moment.

1273
01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:12.032
I have to show you something.

1274
01:02:12.163 --> 01:02:13.120
Can't it wait until later?

1275
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:15.253
We only have so much
time with the judges.

1276
01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:16.907
No. it can't.

1277
01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:27.918
Where did you get this?

1278
01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:29.267
I took it.

1279
01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:30.355
when?

1280
01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.748
Not that long ago.

1281
01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.187
The Italian restaurant
around the corner.

1282
01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:39.407
When you lied to Dad. said
that you had errands to run.

1283
01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:43.498
I cannot believe you're
sleeping with Tatum's dad. Mom.

1284
01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.239
How can you stand
there just talking

1285
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.632
and laughing with Mackenzie?

1286
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:47.938
Shh.

1287
01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:50.767
Honey. I am so sorry.

1288
01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:53.030
Mom. how could you do that?

1289
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.249
I'm so sorry.

1290
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.077
How can I make this up to you?

1291
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.905
-Honey. please.
-Make it up to me?

1292
01:03:00.124 --> 01:03:01.212
You can walk over
there and tell Faye

1293
01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:02.474
that we quit the pageant.

1294
01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:05.390
-No.
-Do it right now. Mom.

1295
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.045
or I send this photo to every
single person in this room.

1296
01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.655
Honey. please.

1297
01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.224
Why do you wanna quit? We're...

1298
01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:17.968
I am not telling Dad about the
affair. it would crush him.

1299
01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:21.406
But I am not doing this anymore.

1300
01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:24.409
And maybe if you get out of
this crazy pageant world.

1301
01:03:24.539 --> 01:03:26.324
you'll remember what's
really important.

1302
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:35.594
My father went into
hospice.

1303
01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:38.466
We don't know how much
longer he has left.

1304
01:03:38.597 --> 01:03:41.600
Oh. Darcy. I am so sorry.

1305
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.688
Of course. we're disappointed

1306
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.430
to lose you both
from the competition.

1307
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.824
Please let us know if there's
anything that we can do.

1308
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.183
Whoa. what's happening?

1309
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:01.315
My life is over.

1310
01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:03.361
That's dramatic.

1311
01:04:04.623 --> 01:04:06.190
Mia found out about
the affair.

1312
01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.410
Ugh. I told you. you're
being too sloppy.

1313
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.109
She found a photo of
us. and she threatened

1314
01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:14.372
to expose me if I don't
drop outta the pageant.

1315
01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:17.679
It's her way of
getting back at me.

1316
01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:21.118
Tough break.

1317
01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:26.166
That's it?

1318
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:29.039
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

1319
01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.174
Darcy. we're connected
by the pageant.

1320
01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:37.482
it's not like we
have a friendship

1321
01:04:37.612 --> 01:04:39.136
outside of this world.

1322
01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:58.198
Mia. where are you going?

1323
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:00.244
Why don't you ask your mom?

1324
01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:01.898
What?

1325
01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:05.205
I'm sorry. Lilliana.

1326
01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:08.948
I like you. we're friends.

1327
01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:12.212
but your mom is
not a nice person.

1328
01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:13.866
And I'm sorry to say that.

1329
01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:16.347
but there is something
seriously wrong with her.

1330
01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:19.741
I've lived with her
for 18 years. I know.

1331
01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.091
Just. what did she do?

1332
01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:26.009
Well. for starters. she's
blackmailing my mom.

1333
01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:27.140
Are you serious?

1334
01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:28.141
Mm-hmm.

1335
01:05:28.272 --> 01:05:30.143
What does she even
want from her?

1336
01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:34.104
I don't know exactly. but I
hope you figure it out soon.

1337
01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:35.627
before things get worse.

1338
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.977
I gotta go.

1339
01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:39.239
Okay. See ya.

1340
01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:49.119
Hey. um. have you seen Mia?

1341
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:51.338
She. she just left.

1342
01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.732
Do you know what's going
on between her and my mom?

1343
01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:58.302
Sophie. please. if you know
something you have to tell me.

1344
01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:08.660
Darcy. are you okay?

1345
01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:10.618
No.

1346
01:06:12.446 --> 01:06:15.580
And Emilia. you should
watch your back.

1347
01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:35.165
I like the color of this dress.

1348
01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.472
But this dress looks way
more flattering on you.

1349
01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:40.474
Let's try them both on.

1350
01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:43.521
Lilliana. what's your problem?

1351
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:44.652
Get with it. we're
down to the wire.

1352
01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:46.480
I'm doing all the work.

1353
01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.004
What work are you doing. Mom?

1354
01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:50.006
Excuse me?

1355
01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.314
Oh. let me guess. your
father's in your ear again.

1356
01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:56.012
poisoning you against me.

1357
01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:58.318
No. you do a good enough
job of that yourself.

1358
01:06:58.449 --> 01:07:00.233
He always resented pageants.

1359
01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:02.279
He never supported your dreams.

1360
01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:03.758
That is not true.

1361
01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:07.501
Oh. really. then why wasn't
he at your last pageant.

1362
01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:09.503
when you won the crown?

1363
01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:12.028
Because he was stuck at
work with an emergency.

1364
01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:14.030
You remember that. All
of the servers went down.

1365
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.553
No.

1366
01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:17.816
Lilliana. he was holed up in
some hotel with his assistant.

1367
01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:19.513
No. Mom. that's not true.

1368
01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:21.472
You know that's not true.

1369
01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:22.690
Dad didn't cheat on you.

1370
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:26.303
Come on. Lilliana. you
are not a stupid girl.

1371
01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:27.826
No. Mom. I'm not.

1372
01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.788
You know what?

1373
01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:35.573
I don't like either
of these for you.

1374
01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.010
I'm gonna call the boutique

1375
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.881
and have them send
over some more options.

1376
01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:45.800
You reached Patrick.

1377
01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:48.238
Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.

1378
01:07:48.368 --> 01:07:51.415
Hey. Dad. can you
give me a call back?

1379
01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:52.894
It's about Mom.

1380
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:19.878
-Hey.
-Hey. how's it going?

1381
01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:22.315
Well. my mom is devastated

1382
01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:23.837
that I made her
quit the pageant.

1383
01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:26.450
But other than that.
everything's great.

1384
01:08:28.495 --> 01:08:30.018
What's up with you?

1385
01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:31.541
I was looking
through some articles

1386
01:08:31.672 --> 01:08:32.978
about that girl. Harper.

1387
01:08:33.978 --> 01:08:35.067
Harper?

1388
01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:36.547
Really? Why?

1389
01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:39.027
Don't you think it's weird
that she was killed so close

1390
01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:40.464
to the pageant last year?

1391
01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:45.729
Well. it was awful. but
what do you mean by weird?

1392
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.777
Did the police ever suspect
anyone from the pageant?

1393
01:08:49.907 --> 01:08:51.214
Um. the case was closed

1394
01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.825
as a random robbery
pretty quickly.

1395
01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:56.262
I mean. they talked to all
of us girls and our parents.

1396
01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:59.352
but I never got the feeling
they thought any of us did it.

1397
01:08:59.483 --> 01:09:01.572
Was. was the pageant
unusually intense

1398
01:09:01.702 --> 01:09:03.139
that year or something?

1399
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.794
No. it was just a normal
amount of tension. I would say.

1400
01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:10.755
Although. there was this one
thing Harper was worried about.

1401
01:09:10.885 --> 01:09:11.669
What was it?

1402
01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.716
Well. you know that
judge. Franklin.

1403
01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:18.545
apparently he came on to
her and she rejected him.

1404
01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:20.504
Harper was worried that people

1405
01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.288
would think she was
favorite to win.

1406
01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.334
Did any of the other
contestants know that?

1407
01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.511
Well. there were rumors.

1408
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.513
but it was squashed
pretty quickly.

1409
01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:37.999
So. certain contestants
knew that Harper

1410
01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:39.086
was favored by Franklin?

1411
01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:40.393
Exactly.

1412
01:09:40.523 --> 01:09:43.353
And what if Adeline was
one of those people?

1413
01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.703
Hey. remember. you said Cyrus

1414
01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:49.794
was really complimentary
of us. right?

1415
01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.012
Yeah.

1416
01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:52.449
Did Adeline know that?

1417
01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:53.580
It's possible.

1418
01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:57.323
Mom. if Adeline is
responsible for Cyrus

1419
01:09:57.454 --> 01:10:00.544
or Harper's death. we
have to do something.

1420
01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:05.375
Oh. it's Lilliana.

1421
01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:08.639
She wants to talk.

1422
01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:10.554
I didn't tell her about
Darcy's affair yesterday

1423
01:10:10.684 --> 01:10:12.512
because I felt like
that was Mia's place

1424
01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.121
to decide whether she
should know or not.

1425
01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:15.428
Right.

1426
01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:18.300
But she seemed really
upset about her mom.

1427
01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:19.476
You know what?

1428
01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:22.653
Speaking of Darcy. I think I
should pay her a visit today.

1429
01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:24.350
Try to figure out
exactly why she

1430
01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:25.873
was warning me about Adeline.

1431
01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:27.788
Do you think she'll talk to you?

1432
01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:29.529
It's worth a try.

1433
01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:42.977
-Hi.
-Emilia.

1434
01:10:43.108 --> 01:10:44.240
What are you doing here?

1435
01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:48.156
This really isn't a good time.

1436
01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:50.550
I just wanted to
talk about yesterday.

1437
01:10:51.898 --> 01:10:52.900
Do you know?

1438
01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:56.252
About your affair?

1439
01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.255
-Yes.
-Shh.

1440
01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:02.996
My husband is home.
please. I haven't told him.

1441
01:11:03.128 --> 01:11:04.564
I have no intentions
of revealing your

1442
01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:05.957
personal business.

1443
01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:07.871
I just wanted to
know what you meant

1444
01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:10.614
when you were warning me to
watch my back around Adeline.

1445
01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:14.966
I'm sorry. Emilia.
I really shouldn't

1446
01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:17.447
be talking to you about Adeline.

1447
01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:19.536
Why are you so scared of her?

1448
01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:21.189
Is it because of your
affair. or something else?

1449
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.539
Okay. please.

1450
01:11:27.674 --> 01:11:31.287
Look. I don't know
anything for sure.

1451
01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:33.637
Darcy. mother to mother.

1452
01:11:33.767 --> 01:11:35.856
if Adeline has done
something awful.

1453
01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:37.815
you don't want her hurting
anyone else. right?

1454
01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:44.952
Adeline was at the country
club the night Cyrus died.

1455
01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:47.737
I left early. she stayed.

1456
01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:49.043
Why was she there?

1457
01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:51.307
Because she believes he
favored you and Sophie.

1458
01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:52.090
-Ugh.
-She wanted

1459
01:11:52.219 --> 01:11:53.960
to convince him otherwise.

1460
01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.487
Do you think she killed him?

1461
01:11:57.617 --> 01:11:58.749
I can't be involved.

1462
01:11:58.879 --> 01:11:59.619
No. no. wait. Hey. hey.

1463
01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:00.664
Hey. okay.

1464
01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:04.276
Does the country club
have security cameras?

1465
01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:06.800
I don't know. but my friend.
he's the manager there.

1466
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.280
he said the police have
already looked into this.

1467
01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:10.804
Can you just ask him and see?

1468
01:12:10.934 --> 01:12:12.371
He's on vacation right now.

1469
01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:16.723
but I'll do my
best to reach him.

1470
01:12:16.853 --> 01:12:18.638
Okay. Thank you.

1471
01:12:38.657 --> 01:12:40.921
Is it about the footage
from the country club?

1472
01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:42.793
Darcy spoke to the manager.

1473
01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:45.143
Someone on the maintenance
crew set up trail cameras

1474
01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:48.451
to watch for animals that could
cause damage to the course.

1475
01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:49.669
Apparently they're going
through the footage.

1476
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.541
but it's gonna take time.

1477
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.934
Time that we don't have.

1478
01:12:55.066 --> 01:12:57.242
Come on.

1479
01:12:59.287 --> 01:13:02.334
♪ Ooh-Hoo-hoo

1480
01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:05.946
We've got 45 minutes
dress rehearsal. everyone.

1481
01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:06.860
Mom. guess what?

1482
01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:08.601
Oh. Lilliana. not right now.

1483
01:13:08.732 --> 01:13:10.429
You're gonna want to hear this.

1484
01:13:10.559 --> 01:13:11.865
I just got us Franklin's vote.

1485
01:13:12.952 --> 01:13:15.173
What? How do you know?

1486
01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:17.175
I took your advice.

1487
01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:22.049
Had a. you know. productive
conversation with him.

1488
01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.746
He assured me his vote was ours.

1489
01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:24.704
Oh...

1490
01:13:26.097 --> 01:13:26.837
Okay.

1491
01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:31.450
Glad to see you're
comin' around. honey.

1492
01:13:32.755 --> 01:13:34.844
All right. now that
we have Warren's vote

1493
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:38.152
and Franklin's vote. I
guess we have nothing

1494
01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:39.415
to worry about then.

1495
01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:40.546
Yeah. we're good.

1496
01:13:42.156 --> 01:13:43.549
I'm gonna go put some lipstick
on before we go on camera.

1497
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.768
Sounds good.

1498
01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:55.387
She bought it.

1499
01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.954
Okay. at least we
don't have to worry

1500
01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:58.259
about your mom thinking
we're a threat.

1501
01:13:58.389 --> 01:14:00.305
Yeah. you guys are good.

1502
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.132
-Okay.
-I'll see you back there.

1503
01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:01.959
Okay.

1504
01:14:04.091 --> 01:14:06.702
Hi. sweetheart. Everything okay?

1505
01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.009
Yeah. Grandma. Why?

1506
01:14:09.139 --> 01:14:12.012
You seem to have been a bit
off these past few days.

1507
01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:14.537
I. I just think it's
stress from the pageant.

1508
01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:16.974
I mean. you know
how that is. right?

1509
01:14:17.103 --> 01:14:18.584
You sure there's
nothing else going on

1510
01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:19.933
that I should be aware of?

1511
01:14:20.064 --> 01:14:21.934
No. everything is fine.

1512
01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:25.896
Well. then thank you for
carrying this pageant

1513
01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:27.419
for you and your mother.

1514
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.856
I think we both know who the
real star of the family is.

1515
01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:32.990
-I love you. sweetheart.
-Hm. I love you.

1516
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.906
-I'm gonna go get ready.
-Okay. Good luck.

1517
01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:51.661
Hey. I'll be right back.

1518
01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:59.320
Darcy. any news?

1519
01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:00.887
They found something.

1520
01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.063
There is clear
footage of Adeline

1521
01:15:03.193 --> 01:15:06.110
and Cyrus walking together
close to where he died.

1522
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.764
Can you send that to me?

1523
01:15:07.894 --> 01:15:08.895
I'll text it over.

1524
01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:11.071
Are you gonna turn
this into the police?

1525
01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:14.987
Yes. but it doesn't
really prove anything.

1526
01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:18.296
There's no real footage
of Adeline doing it.

1527
01:15:18.425 --> 01:15:19.732
The police will question her.

1528
01:15:19.862 --> 01:15:22.039
but if it's not
enough for an arrest.

1529
01:15:22.169 --> 01:15:24.520
I am terrified of
what she'll do then.

1530
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.835
Sophie!

1531
01:15:35.966 --> 01:15:38.272
Why are you fumbling around?

1532
01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:40.231
I can't find my shoes.

1533
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.755
Well. can you look a bit more
quietly and on your side?

1534
01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:45.062
I'd like some peace
before we go on camera.

1535
01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:49.022
Sophie. did you leave
them in the car?

1536
01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:51.721
I'll go check.

1537
01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:06.213
Can. can I help you?

1538
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:08.912
Oh. hi. um...

1539
01:16:10.174 --> 01:16:12.263
Hi. I'm Lilliana's father.

1540
01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:14.874
Are. are you one
of the contestants?

1541
01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:17.094
Yeah. I'm Sophie.

1542
01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:18.835
Yeah. Lilliana
told me about you.

1543
01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.880
She told me everything.

1544
01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:24.928
And if it's all true. if
Adeline really hurt someone.

1545
01:16:25.058 --> 01:16:27.974
I just gotta make
sure Lilliana's okay.

1546
01:16:28.105 --> 01:16:30.193
Then why are you sneaking
around the building?

1547
01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.978
Well. I'm trying
to find the best way in.

1548
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.503
because if I call
Lilliana. or if I text her

1549
01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:38.724
and my ex-wife sees
it. she will lose it.

1550
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.120
Okay. just wait right here.

1551
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.077
Okay.

1552
01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:46.950
Thank you.

1553
01:16:53.085 --> 01:16:54.871
Hey. your dad is here.

1554
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.481
Oh my God. he came.

1555
01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:09.059
-My gosh. Dad!
-Hi.

1556
01:17:10.582 --> 01:17:11.670
What are you doing? I
thought you were in Montreal?

1557
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.844
I left early.

1558
01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:14.585
I cannot leave you
alone with your mother.

1559
01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:15.413
Thank you.

1560
01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:18.242
So. Darcy sent over the footage.

1561
01:17:18.371 --> 01:17:21.114
and it does prove your mom
was with Cyrus that night.

1562
01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:22.898
near where his body was found.

1563
01:17:23.029 --> 01:17:24.639
Okay. you guys. we have
to go to the police.

1564
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.120
I agree. but Darcy doesn't
think it's enough evidence.

1565
01:17:27.251 --> 01:17:28.818
and I'm with her on that.

1566
01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:32.038
All right. so what do we do?

1567
01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:35.825
Adeline thinks she's gonna
win. her guard is down.

1568
01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:39.002
The dress rehearsal
will be broadcast live.

1569
01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:41.134
If we can work together.

1570
01:17:41.264 --> 01:17:43.353
we might be able to get
a confession out of her.

1571
01:17:43.484 --> 01:17:44.268
How?

1572
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.011
What if we play the video
in front of everyone?

1573
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:50.666
I mean. Dad. you're obviously
good with technology.

1574
01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:53.233
you could probably hook
it up to the main stage.

1575
01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:54.974
I mean. yeah.

1576
01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:57.455
I think we have to try.

1577
01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:58.369
Let's do it.

1578
01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:01.285
Okay.

1579
01:18:12.469 --> 01:18:13.993
Come on. come on. come on.

1580
01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:16.648
Yes.

1581
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:28.791
Take your places. ladies.

1582
01:18:28.921 --> 01:18:29.835
You look beautiful.

1583
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.360
Right along there. That's right.

1584
01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:35.754
There we go.

1585
01:18:35.885 --> 01:18:37.407
And we're just about ready.

1586
01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:40.759
Ah. this is my moment.

1587
01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:41.717
I mean. ours.

1588
01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:45.590
I think it will be.

1589
01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:52.989
Ladies and gentlemen.
it's showtime.

1590
01:18:53.119 --> 01:18:55.121
I'd like to thank
our audience at home

1591
01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:57.036
for watching us live right now.

1592
01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.559
This is the first
time we've given

1593
01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:00.387
a behind the scenes look to you.

1594
01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:03.173
and we couldn't be more excited.

1595
01:19:03.303 --> 01:19:07.090
Before we get started. I'd
like to welcome a true icon

1596
01:19:07.219 --> 01:19:10.789
of our pageant community
without whose generous support

1597
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.574
this evening would
not be possible.

1598
01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:18.188
The winner of an unprecedented
17 pageant crowns.

1599
01:19:18.318 --> 01:19:22.322
the one. the only.
Rebecca Bordeaux.

1600
01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:35.248
To celebrate Rebecca's
lifetime of accomplishments.

1601
01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:38.817
on and offstage. we've put
together a special presentation

1602
01:19:38.948 --> 01:19:40.950
to honor her incredible legacy.

1603
01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:50.002
What is that.

1604
01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:52.396
Faye. what's going on?

1605
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:56.487
Uh. uh. I'm so sorry. I don't
know why this is playin'.

1606
01:19:56.617 --> 01:19:58.750
Is that
Adeline and Cyrus?

1607
01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.969
Isn't that where he died?

1608
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:02.406
What is the meaning of this?

1609
01:20:02.536 --> 01:20:04.538
Uh. I...

1610
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:06.062
This video is obviously a fake.

1611
01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:07.454
-Mom.
-Hey. hey. stop.

1612
01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:08.151
-Turn it off.
-Mom!

1613
01:20:08.281 --> 01:20:10.066
Off. Turn it. turn it off!

1614
01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.545
Right now! Right now!

1615
01:20:11.675 --> 01:20:12.982
Mom. stop!

1616
01:20:13.112 --> 01:20:14.157
Everyone knows your lying.

1617
01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:17.594
I'm so sorry. everyone.

1618
01:20:17.725 --> 01:20:19.510
I don't condone this kind of
behavior from my daughter.

1619
01:20:19.639 --> 01:20:21.120
If you just give
us a few moments.

1620
01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:21.947
Ouch. Mom.

1621
01:20:22.077 --> 01:20:23.601
Adeline. let go of her.

1622
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:24.689
Get off me.

1623
01:20:26.778 --> 01:20:29.215
This is. you are
doing. isn't it?

1624
01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:30.826
You're trying to turn
my daughter against me

1625
01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.566
so that you can win?

1626
01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:34.133
All right. all
right. that's enough.

1627
01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:36.396
That's enough. turn off
those cameras right now.

1628
01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:39.094
-Keep rolling.
-Turn off that camera now!

1629
01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:40.313
Sorry. Mrs. Bordeaux.

1630
01:20:40.443 --> 01:20:42.272
I'm here to broadcast
what happens backstage

1631
01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:43.534
at a dress rehearsal.

1632
01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:45.144
The cameras are staying on.

1633
01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:46.666
Do not turn that camera off.

1634
01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:49.105
You killed Cyrus. didn't you?

1635
01:20:49.235 --> 01:20:51.324
Because he wasn't
going to vote for you?

1636
01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:56.242
How dare you accuse me
of something like that.

1637
01:20:56.373 --> 01:20:58.027
And then he was
replaced by Warren.

1638
01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:03.162
Faye. what made you appoint
him to replace Cyrus?

1639
01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:05.164
Uh...

1640
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:10.126
He came highly recommended.

1641
01:21:10.255 --> 01:21:11.692
Oh. please. by who?

1642
01:21:12.519 --> 01:21:13.433
Adeline?

1643
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:19.135
Ugh. I'm gonna sue you for
defamation of character.

1644
01:21:19.264 --> 01:21:21.528
This woman has never done
a pageant in her life.

1645
01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:23.922
and she shows up this year.

1646
01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:26.142
Clearly. she has a
vendetta against me.

1647
01:21:26.272 --> 01:21:29.188
Mom. stop lying! Stop!

1648
01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:30.581
I did not raise you like this.

1649
01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:32.322
You are acting like your father.

1650
01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:34.889
Adeline. Enough!

1651
01:21:37.282 --> 01:21:39.242
If you'll all excuse
me for a few moments.

1652
01:21:39.371 --> 01:21:41.200
I need some time to
deal with family.

1653
01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:42.985
Mother. I need you outside.

1654
01:21:43.115 --> 01:21:44.638
Stop!

1655
01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:45.987
You're not leaving
until you tell us

1656
01:21:46.118 --> 01:21:47.076
what happened to Harper.

1657
01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.383
What about her?

1658
01:21:50.514 --> 01:21:52.603
You killed her too. didn't you?

1659
01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:54.083
You tried to stage
it as a robbery.

1660
01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:57.782
You little bitch!

1661
01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.175
Don't you ever come
near my daughter!

1662
01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:00.132
Adeline!

1663
01:22:00.263 --> 01:22:03.179
Adeline. stop this right now!

1664
01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:06.660
You are a disgrace. a
stain on our family.

1665
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.227
Get out of my sight.

1666
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:12.144
Doesn't that make you happy?

1667
01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:14.712
After all these
years. you finally got

1668
01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:16.800
what you've always wanted.

1669
01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:20.805
A daughter who's
exactly like you.

1670
01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:33.425
I should stab you in your
miserable heart!

1671
01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:38.823
But you won't.

1672
01:22:40.607 --> 01:22:42.261
Can't even do that right.

1673
01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:57.276
Oh no. you're not
going anywhere.

1674
01:23:09.853 --> 01:23:12.291
I did this for you.

1675
01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:15.903
I killed Harper and
Cyrus because of you.

1676
01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.862
Because you never
gave me any choice.

1677
01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:21.996
You created all of this.

1678
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.826
Why aren't you on my side?

1679
01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:27.827
Why won't you love me?

1680
01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:30.309
What is it about me?

1681
01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.442
You've never put me first.

1682
01:23:34.879 --> 01:23:37.708
Why. Mom?

1683
01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:43.496
My God.

1684
01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:46.847
Rebecca. do you
have any comments

1685
01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:49.415
about what's transpired tonight?

1686
01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:51.200
No comment.

1687
01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:53.332
She's not worth a single word.

1688
01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:04.213
M- mom. get back here!

1689
01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:08.260
No!

1690
01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:17.356
Listen. thank you both

1691
01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:18.270
for having me over this morning.

1692
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:21.012
Of course. We're
glad you came by.

1693
01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:23.362
So. I'm sure you both
heard that the pageant

1694
01:24:23.493 --> 01:24:25.538
has been shut down for good.

1695
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:27.236
-Mm-hmm.
-But you had my vote.

1696
01:24:29.499 --> 01:24:31.153
So. Emilia. how's everything
going with your spa?

1697
01:24:31.282 --> 01:24:32.458
Oh. excellent.

1698
01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:34.068
Insurance finally came
through to fix the damage.

1699
01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:36.071
so we should be up and running
and on schedule.

1700
01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.594
Yeah. I'm so happy to hear that.

1701
01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:39.030
Thank you.

1702
01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:42.120
And Sophie. how about
your literature residency?

1703
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:44.209
Uh. unfortunately.
we were unable

1704
01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.558
to scrape the money together.

1705
01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:48.344
I can help.

1706
01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:50.650
I'd love to sponsor
your residency.

1707
01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:52.348
What? Wait. what?

1708
01:24:52.478 --> 01:24:53.218
Are. are you sure?

1709
01:24:53.349 --> 01:24:54.350
Absolutely.

1710
01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.786
You deserved that win.

1711
01:24:55.916 --> 01:24:57.092
It's my pleasure to help out.

1712
01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:58.136
Oh. Mom!

1713
01:24:58.267 --> 01:25:00.050
That is so generous
of you. Vanessa.

1714
01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.443
Thank you. truly.

1715
01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:03.010
Thank you so much.

1716
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:05.577
My pleasure.

1717
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:08.320
-Ah. you're going to London.
-I'm going to London.

1718
01:25:08.451 --> 01:25:09.278
Yes!

1719
01:25:09.407 --> 01:25:12.324
-Let's do a cheers.
-Yeah!

1720
01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:14.544
-To London.
-To London!

1721
01:25:16.198 --> 01:25:18.460
I've been
to London many times.

1722
01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:20.202
So what's the first
thing you wanna see?

1723
01:25:20.332 --> 01:25:22.987
Gosh. I mean. I
don't know. Everything.
