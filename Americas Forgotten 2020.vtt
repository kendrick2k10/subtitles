Los Angeles. one of the

And in the City of Angels.
spanning east to west.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.593

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.653
to the estates in Bel Air.

15
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.573
lies the heart of Hollywood.

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.390
In this area is some of the
most expensive real estate

in the world.

18
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.503
And down the street
live Jonathan and Mandy.

19
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.970
Their home today is a sidewalk

20
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.223
by the Veterans
Administration in Los Angeles.

21
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.923
Jonathan is an ex-marine.
a veteran of the Iraq War.

22
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.390
He and his wife are two of the thousands

23
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.063
of homeless veterans in America today.

24
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.400
They're also a part

25
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.720
of over half a million homeless Americans

26
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.033

- [Jonathan] My name is Jonathan DeCoster.

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:30.220
(soldiers chattering)

31
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.753
I was born in Fredericksburg. Virginia.

32
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.043
Kentucky is a beautiful.

33
00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:41.620
it's a beautiful place. I'll say that.

34
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.300
You get all four seasons in one week.

35
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.913
My dad's name was Charles DeCoster.

36
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.393
He was my best friend.

37
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.720
- Your brother was deployed
at that time. right?

38
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.553
Or was he...

39
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.813
You guys were deployed at the same time.

40
00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.773
- I think my brother was deployed.

41
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.228
I think he was on a ship at that time.

42
00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:11.550
But when I was in Iraq.
my brother was also there.

43
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.340
My family is super religious.

44
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.093
You know. gung-ho Jesus.
so to speak. (chuckles)

45
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.510
I grew up in a Pentecostal church

46
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.550
where it was constant
hell. fire. and damnation.

47
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.550
So. every night when I went to bed.

48
00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:36.480
I was concerned about
dying and burning in hell

49
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.903
for the rest of eternity.

50
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.770
- My mother said. "You know what?

51
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.610
Your father pray more than I pray.

52
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.340
Your father know about the Catholic Church

53
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.173
more than I know."

54
00:03:51.173 --> 00:03:54.013
I'm from Mexico. from
Puerto Vallarta. Jalisco.

55
00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.690
Puerto Vallarta is beautiful.

56
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.020
It's a beach.

57
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.310
It's nice.

58
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.893
It's. I don't know. how do you turismo?

59
00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.445
Turi-
- Tourism.

60
00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:07.278
- Tourism.

61
00:04:07.278 --> 00:04:08.120
(soft music)

62
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.167
My family is big.

63
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.913
My father and my mom. they had 15 kids.

64
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.353
When I was in Puerto
Vallarta. before I come here.

65
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.760
I always had fun with my friends.

66
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.340
I had a lot of friends.

67
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.100
And I loved to go to the
beach. to go to the rivers.

68
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.860
to play volleyball. to play soccer.

69
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.300
and to be sitting my
father in the potrero.

70
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.090
The potrero is the farm

71
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.090
that he had the cows. the horses.

72
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.298
I don't know how I say
in English. ordenar?

73
00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:53.003
To get the milk from the cow?

74
00:04:53.003 --> 00:04:53.910
Cow?

75
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.980
Yeah.

76
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.010
I loved to do that with my father. yes.

77
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.133
When I was a child. before I come here.

78
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.520
it's the most happy that
one person could have.

79
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.271
When I was a little girl.
I think since I was born.

80
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:15.777
does not matter I was poor.

81
00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:17.287
I was having my father.

82
00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:22.050
I was having my mom. my
sisters. my brothers.

83
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.173
I was very. very happy.

84
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.080
- Dominic was born in Germany 1982

85
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.780
in the same hospital I was born in.

86
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.020
and he grew up around my parents.

87
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.890
We lived in the same small town.

88
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.792
and he went to the German kindergarten

89
00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:41.640
and he was loved by everybody.

90
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.970
He was just that little
German chocolate sunshine.

91
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.970
When he turned 10. we
moved to the United States.

92
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.440
Life on Waterfall Circle
was idyllic almost.

93
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.460
You know. every race. every
color was living there.

94
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.570
Dominic attended Vista
Heights Middle School.

95
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.350
and then went on to Canyon
Springs High School.

96
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.973
Dominic was just an all-American kid.

97
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.050
(intriguing music)

98
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.223
- [Namrata] In 2019. I
have to fly to India.

99
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.490
We have to pick up some
shots for "Finding Match."

100
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.200
a film I'm directing on organ
and bone marrow transplants

101
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.290
in ethnically diverse communities.

102
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.113
The trip is short. but I'm very excited.

103
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.210
I always jump at the
opportunity to go to India.

104
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.400
the land of my ancestors.

105
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.470
where I get to re-embrace the spirituality

106
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.999
and mysticism of India.
every time I visit.

107
00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.832
(bell clanking)

108
00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:47.080
But at heart. I'm a homebody.

109
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.440
a proud American. a patriotic citizen.

110
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.800
and a fervent Democrat.

111
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.040
I mention my political affiliation

112
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.280
because it's crucial to
why this film got made.

113
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.720
I keep abreast of American politics

114
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.700
no matter what part of the world I'm in.

115
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.810
And tonight is the
first Democratic debate.

116
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.210
And then comes a question

117
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.110
that is about to change my world view.

118
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.360
- Today. it broke our hearts.

119
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.620
And they had names. Oscar Martinez.

120
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.120
and his 23-month-old
daughter. Valeria. died.

121
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.073
trying to cross the river to
ask for asylum in this country.

122
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.260
- Watching that image of Oscar

123
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.053
and his daughter.
Valeria. is heartbreaking.

124
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.150
It should also piss us all off.

125
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.380
If I were President today-
(audience applauding)

126
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.920
- [Namrata] Piss me off?

127
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.400
Yes. it does. immensely.

128
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.270
After all. we're a nation
founded on immigration. right?

129
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.660
- Unless you're one of
the first Americans.

130
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.480
a Native American. you
came from someplace else.

131
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.505
Somebody brought you.

132
00:07:55.505 --> 00:07:57.580
(cheering)

133
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.220
- [Namrata] I often use this
byte from President Obama

134
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.910
as a short. precise way to
define the American population.

135
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.470
Native Americans are indeed

136
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.230
the only true non-immigrant
population in the United States.

137
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.593
And that's the beauty of America.

138
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.800
A matrix of all shades and backgrounds

139
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.315
living as one people.

140
00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:20.379
(tribal music)

141
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.360
(cheerful bagpipe music)

142
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.010
My husband didn't see color

143
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.840
when we married over
a quarter century ago.

144
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.690
Neither did I.

145
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.360
In fact. being in an
inter-racial marriage.

146
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.890
my husband and I decided
to retrace our roots.

147
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.690
One day. we would visit
Scotland and Pakistan.

148
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.193
where our great-great
grandparents came from.

149
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.163
It was amazing to visit
his roots in Glasgow.

150
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.350
My great grandfather's home in Pakistan

151
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.776
is on the bucket list.

152
00:08:49.776 --> 00:08:52.010
("Amazing Grace")

153
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.980
My point is. America's
deeply rooted immigration

154
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.070
is part of the reason why
many of us are so sympathetic

155
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.860
to today's current immigration crisis.

156
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.133
particularly that of the
undocumented immigrant.

157
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.530
Many of us feel that it is hypocritical

158
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.410
and goes against our morals and values.

159
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.550
to deny help and safety to
people who request asylum.

160
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.820
when our very own ancestors

161
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.233
sought the same refuge
in America centuries ago.

162
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.320
Most of us wouldn't be here

163
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.310
had America closed its borders then.

164
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.593
so why should we close them now?

165
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.140
I'm even more shocked to
learn that not just Valeria.

166
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.180
but hundreds of undocumented
immigrant children.

167
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.000
have died in their attempt

168
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.343
to cross over the American border.

169
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.180
One of these little children
who died on our border

170
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.120
last week is from India.

171
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.080
It just so happens that this little girl

172
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.573
belonged to the very area
I'm visiting right now.

173
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.983
This little girl's name is Gurpreet.

174
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.220
- A seven-year-old girl died in the desert

175
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.120
west of Tuscon this week.
as she and her sister

176
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.286
and three adult women
entered the US illegally.

177
00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:11.410
- As KGUN 9 On Your Side's
Craig Smith reports.

178
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.120
this child came from the country of India.

179
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.550
- [Craig] Agents say most immigrants

180
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.880
come from Central America.

181
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.910
but they do see immigrants from India.

182
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.097
Africa. and other parts of the world.

183
00:10:21.097 --> 00:10:22.145
and they usually connect-

184
00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:23.437
(soft flute music)

185
00:10:23.437 --> 00:10:25.680
- [Namrata] Further research teaches me

186
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.430
that Gurpreet's family
is from Punjab. in India.

187
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.943
where my family's from.

188
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.973
But unlike me. they went
to America to seek asylum.

189
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.780
Because I have lived outside of India

190
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.650
for the majority of my life.

191
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.770
I am clueless about the circumstances

192
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.900
that would cause Gurpreet's
family to seek asylum.

193
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.560
Her parents indicated they wanted a safer.

194
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.263
better life for Gurpreet.

195
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.160
I know there are parts of
India that are very poor.

196
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.100
We know religious persecution exists

197
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.400
in many parts of the world.

198
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.000
But how bad does poverty
or persecution have to be

199
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.270
for a mother to take her
child on such a dangerous trek

200
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.370
just to seek refuge?

201
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.310
Since I'm right here.
I decide to find out.

202
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.120
Maybe as a filmmaker. I'm
brought here by the universe

203
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.250
to share this child's story.

204
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.070
And so begins my search for
this little girl's legacy.

205
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.097
Who died this week on US-Mexico border.

206
00:11:23.097 --> 00:11:28.097
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

207
00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:33.959
(helicopter chopping)

208
00:11:39.412 --> 00:11:40.830
- One thing that always amazes me

209
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.180
is that he enlisted knowing
he was gonna go to war.

210
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.470
because we were in the
midst of it. you know?

211
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.970
- I was in a social studies class.

212
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.290
A building was smoking.

213
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.313
I had no idea what happened.

214
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.000
And they're sitting here
talking about a plane

215
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.693
flying into the building.
into the Twin Towers.

216
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.290
I say by the end of the
day on September 11th.

217
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.753
I felt pretty enraged.

218
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.400
And then I went to
bootcamp in June of 2006.

219
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.330
And then I turned 18 August of 2006.

220
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.057
And then I turned 19 in Iraq.

221
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.410
Camp Fallujah is a very big base.

222
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.320
When I was in Iraq.
hell yeah. I was scared.

223
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.993
I turned 19 in.

224
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.580
it was Al Taqaddum Air Force Base in Iraq.

225
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.413
On that day.

226
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.973
I went to the chow hall three times.

227
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.120
I watched somebody try
and put an entire can

228
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.640
of Copenhagen in their mouth.

229
00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.840
He ended up throwing up.

230
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.570
That was pretty much the
highlight of my 19th birthday.

231
00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:12.578
Birthday cakes are overrated.

232
00:13:12.578 --> 00:13:14.320
you know what I mean.

233
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.560
- I remember when I was 10.

234
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.360
I loved to go to the theater.

235
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.663
My sister and I. every Saturday. theater.

236
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.880
And I loved to dance.

237
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.880
My family. they don't have
money to give me to study.

238
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.830
And I wanna study.

239
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.160
That's why I came to the
United States. to study.

240
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.530
I'm from Mexico.

241
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.840
Another people that I know

242
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.743
is from El Salvador. Guatemala. Honduras.

243
00:13:45.104 --> 00:13:48.960
And the border. for
everybody. is the same.

244
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.307
We had to jump to United States.

245
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.373
- I'm a legal immigrant.

246
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.753
Took me six years.

247
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.531
This little urn contains
the ashes of my son.

248
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:04.560
(somber music)

249
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.883
I carry him with me all the time.

250
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.210
Dominic and I. we used
to ride our motorcycles.

251
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.290
and I had a real bad crash.

252
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.680
and he was crying and telling me

253
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.010
that that was his worst nightmare.

254
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.437
And we talked about death. and he said.

255
00:14:20.437 --> 00:14:22.470
"Well. what do you want?

256
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.060
You wanna be buried or
you wanna have ashes?"

257
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.730
And I said. "I don't know yet."

258
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.900
And he told me. he said.
"Well. let's have ashes of you.

259
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.810
I can put them in a little hamster ball

260
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.330
and have them in the car
with me all the time.

261
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.920
And I'm not stuck to a
city with a graveyard.

262
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.690
I can move anywhere and take you with me."

263
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.230
And I never thought it would be reversed.

264
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.723
and it would be his ashes I have with me.

265
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.300
When my son. my German chocolate.

266
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.670
graduated from high
school. he had big dreams.

267
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.160
He wanted to work in law enforcement.

268
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
And he joined the 911 dispatch
center. became a dispatcher.

269
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.630
and he was studying to
become a motorcycle cop.

270
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.930
And then also studying to
become a helicopter pilot

271
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.100
for the sheriff's department.

272
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.080
Who would have known that my son.

273
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.600
with all his big dreams.
just 12 years later.

274
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.200
down the street from his
high school on Pigeon Pass.

275
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.880
would lose his life in such a cruel manner

276
00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.885
and his dreams would be cut short forever?

277
00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:32.302
(soft music)

278
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.117
- I met one woman and she told me.

279
00:15:37.117 --> 00:15:40.577
"Come. let's go to Mexicali."

280
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.517
I never think that I
wanna start a nightmare.

281
00:15:48.184 --> 00:15:50.390
(dial tone ringing)

282
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.863
- [Man On Phone] Good morning. ma'am.

283
00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:55.780
(speaking in foreign language)

284
00:15:58.282 --> 00:15:59.115
- [Woman On Phone] Ms. Gujral.

285
00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:00.960
you may want to try Shailee Dogra.

286
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.690
She's the Hindustan Times journalist

287
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.400
who covers these cases.

288
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.650
- [Woman On Phone] We got your
message regarding Gurpreet.

289
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.300
I'm so sorry. but I cannot
give you more information.

290
00:16:11.165 --> 00:16:13.250
(light music)

291
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.080
- [Namrata] I manage to
contact the HT journalist.

292
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.120
who agrees to meet with
me the following morning.

293
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.230
Hindustan Times is one
of India's top dailies

294
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.610
with a reported circulation
of almost a million copies.

295
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.893
This appears to be a good
start to Gurpreet's story.

296
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.000
But before I go any further.
please let me clarify.

297
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.360
This film is neither
Democrat nor Republican.

298
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.000
so if you're looking for
a right or left film.

299
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.820
you might as well quit watching right now.

300
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.610
I have voted for both parties in the past.

301
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.780
but what this film has taught me

302
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.340
is the lines between
liberalism and conservatism

303
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.290
often blur in the face of stark
realities and bitter truths.

304
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.640
As the journalist details her article.

305
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.180
what I hear shakes me to my core.

306
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.500
It leads me to many corners of the world

307
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.370
in search of the truth.

308
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.810
And the truth is hard to swallow.

309
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.400
- If you go to any market.

310
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.381
the first thing that your eye catches

311
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:16.520
is the large hoardings that
promise you to go abroad.

312
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.000
and offer you consultancy in
helping you settle abroad.

313
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.514
so even if you don't have some documents.

314
00:17:22.514 --> 00:17:24.790
There are about 700 which are operating

315
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.240
in Wahali district only.

316
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.270
In that. about 300 were registered.

317
00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:34.900
There are a number of
complaints from the applicants

318
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.130
who say that they had paid
to a consultancy firm.

319
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.950
but they are not returning back.

320
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.440
Neither they have arranged for the visa

321
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.740
which they had promised.

322
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.500
Most of them don't even
know what kind of work

323
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.930
they will be doing there.

324
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.470
They are promised something else.

325
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.610
and it is only when they
reach the foreign shores.

326
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.780
that is when they realize

327
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.883
that they have ended up in a mess.

328
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.030
- [Namrata] The interview is an eye-opener

329
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.130
with regards to the exploitation

330
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.270
that pervades the chain
of illegal immigration.

331
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.080
The HT reporter does not know

332
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.930
the whereabouts of Gurpreet's family.

333
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.810
But she does refers me to
another renowned journalist

334
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.670
from The Indian Express.

335
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.393
who's an expert on illegal immigration.

336
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.580
The Indian Express

337
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.993
is one of India's oldest
and top newspapers.

338
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.470
As I google her work.

339
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.480
the very first article
I find is this piece.

340
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.690
which highlights the stories
of many other children.

341
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.653
who also died on the US
border. while crossing.

342
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.200
As I wait to make contact
with this journalist.

343
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.533
I hear back from one of my local scouts.

344
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.210
He has found me the contact

345
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.171
for one of these perished
children's father.

346
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:51.317
(speaking in foreign language)

347
00:18:51.317 --> 00:18:53.360
(man speaking in foreign language)

348
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.923
Okay. great. thanks.

349
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.784
So. I decide to make a
trip to go meet with him.

350
00:18:58.784 --> 00:19:01.284
(light music)

351
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.840
We agree to go over
the on-camera questions

352
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.743
while I'm driving to his town.

353
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.140
But on my way there.

354
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.483
I drive past one poor
neighborhood after another.

355
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.760
I decide to take some detours
to visit these neighborhoods.

356
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.020
I want to see if I can document

357
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.480
the extent of human suffering.

358
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.810
to where people are willing
to risk their lives.

359
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.593
to seek refuge elsewhere.

360
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.103
And I'm devastated with what I see.

361
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.280
The living conditions here are reminiscent

362
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.100
of the poverty only portrayed
in Hollywood movies.

363
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.120
In fact. some of the local kids

364
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.270
remind me of the cute little boy

365
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.342
from the movie. "Slumdog Millionaire."

366
00:19:54.342 --> 00:19:56.910
(boy speaking in foreign language)

367
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.710
I'm also hoping that
somewhere along the way.

368
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.093
someone can lead me to Gurpreet's family.

369
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.690
I'm in the Doaba region. an
area with the largest number

370
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.400
of undocumented immigrants

371
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.053
who have sought asylum in the West.

372
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.000
Oddly. it doesn't appear
that America is a subject

373
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.283
of conversations in these neighborhoods.

374
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.010
It seems that most of them
don't really know much

375
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.010
about America at all. let
alone wanting to go there.

376
00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:29.976
(speaking in foreign language)

377
00:20:29.976 --> 00:20:34.309
(kids speaking in foreign language)

378
00:20:49.892 --> 00:20:51.600
(train horn blaring)

379
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.810
One particular neighborhood
impacts me profoundly.

380
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.120
There's a little girl playing

381
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.903
on the other side of the tracks.

382
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.100
I imagine Gurpreet as that little girl.

383
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.460
but forced to give up her
childhood and her life.

384
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.473
just so her family can survive.

385
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.070
Back on the road. I call the
gentleman I'm interviewing

386
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.793
so we can go over the topics
we will discuss on-camera.

387
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.500
But oddly. when I ask him if
it was poverty or persecution

388
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.190
or violence that led to his child

389
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.720
making this horrendous journey.

390
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.533
there is silence on the
other end of the line.

391
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.060
Then. just like that.
the line disconnects.

392
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.290
I keep trying. but no one picks up.

393
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.630
Shortly thereafter. I get a strange text

394
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.053
from an attorney on behalf of the father.

395
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.100
Why would he decide to go to Europe

396
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.660
in my middle of a conversation?

397
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.010
Okay. maybe the attorney
doesn't want him to talk to me.

398
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.713
But why wouldn't he just say that?

399
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.693
And then. a disturbing
thought occurs to me.

400
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.563
What if someone else doesn't
want him to talk to me?

401
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.180
But since I'm already on my way.

402
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.663
I decide I'll go talk to
the family's neighbors.

403
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.910
As my crew and I approach
the family's home.

404
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.240
I'm even more confused.

405
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.910
For privacy purposes.

406
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.073
I will not show the exact neighborhood.

407
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.110
But there is no way this is the home

408
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.023
I was invited to to
interview the family at.

409
00:22:36.728 --> 00:22:39.145
(soft music)

410
00:22:40.035 --> 00:22:41.610
(explosions booming)

411
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.323
- Iraq was very hot.

412
00:22:45.158 --> 00:22:48.553
And when we got to Kuwait. it
was 125 degrees at 6:00 a.m.

413
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.168
And at that moment I was like. oh shit.

414
00:22:53.168 --> 00:22:54.490
(Mandy chuckles)

415
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.995
What have I done?

416
00:22:55.995 --> 00:22:58.510
(laughs)

417
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.523
How am I supposed to wear all this gear?

418
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.203
And it's gonna get even
hotter if it's only 6:00 a.m.

419
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.910
- My husband deployed

420
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.650
to one of the most dangerous
places in the world.

421
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.540
so that as a country.

422
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.160
we wouldn't have to worry
about our own safety.

423
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.030
And one of my biggest priorities now

424
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.420
has become safety and
not getting murdered.

425
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.420
or raped. or robbed. in this
supposedly free country.

426
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:36.610
- So. when my dad passed
away on August 1st of 2008.

427
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.270
I took a little bit of time for them

428
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.323
to get me a plane ticket. get me home.

429
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.600
and I got home. I think. August 3rd.

430
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.513
August 5th was when we had the visitation.

431
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.713
That was my 20th birthday.

432
00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:59.356
(chuckles)

433
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.918
Fun three birthdays there for me.

434
00:24:02.918 --> 00:24:05.340
- [Server] Here you go.

435
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.730
Just kinda went downhill from there.

436
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.970
and I got addicted to pain medication.

437
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.673
Not something I ever expected.

438
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.323
Honestly. I had wanted to be in the DEA.

439
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.730
At the time. I actually had an
application pending at the VA

440
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.057
to be a VA police officer.

441
00:24:20.057 --> 00:24:22.417
(weapon firing)

442
00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:23.705
(explosion booms)

443
00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:27.330
(fireworks booming)

444
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:31.510
- Jonathan said he wanted to
get married on Independence Day

445
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.790
and then the fireworks started that night.

446
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.770
I've experienced a few
flashbacks with him.

447
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.653
This. by far. was the most intense.

448
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.143
For some reason. he didn't recognize me.

449
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.820
He thought he was back. I guess. in Iraq.

450
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.500
and for some reason thought
that I was some stranger

451
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.280
trying to imprison him.

452
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.790
It just got worse and worse.

453
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.350
And it's anxiety from your PTSD.

454
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.350
- [Namrata] Shortly thereafter.
I got a text from Jonathan

455
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.367
to help him look for a job.

456
00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:12.177
"Will push brooms. clean
toilets. whatever else." he said.

457
00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:16.064
"We just desperately need an
opportunity to move forward."

458
00:25:16.064 --> 00:25:18.330
(soft music)

459
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.293
- I was thinking there was the coyote.

460
00:25:20.293 --> 00:25:25.293
The coyote is people that
we help us to come here.

461
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.987
But it wasn't.

462
00:25:26.987 --> 00:25:28.936
It was a cartel.

463
00:25:28.936 --> 00:25:31.827
that they call Cartel Gulfo de Mexico.

464
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.355
They kidnapped us.

465
00:25:36.355 --> 00:25:37.760
Kidnapping.

466
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.213
Kidnapped us.

467
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.930
So. they rape. they abuse the girls.

468
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.056
just for a plate of food.

469
00:25:48.056 --> 00:25:49.355
Don't do that.

470
00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:51.470
Don't do that anymore.

471
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.470
We women. we teenagers. we children.

472
00:25:57.925 --> 00:26:00.200
They keep me for a month.

473
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.610
and they forced me to pay every day

474
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.490
1.500 pesos Mexicanos

475
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.227
to be there in that town.

476
00:26:16.087 --> 00:26:19.000
Because I know they will not kill me.

477
00:26:20.187 --> 00:26:22.020
I walked for 10 hours.

478
00:26:23.237 --> 00:26:26.730
They told me that I'm
gonna walk three hours

479
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.920
and they lied to me.

480
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.550
We was aching and we walking for 10 hours.

481
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.073
in the desert. no water. nothing.

482
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.233
One of the people.

483
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.240
they don't walk. they
don't wanna walk anymore.

484
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.940
They left him in the desert.

485
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.620
And I just went. God. please help me.

486
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.690
And thank God. I'm not thirsty.

487
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:59.690
But they sell me with somebody else.

488
00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.180
And they say. "I'm gonna
have you in my car.

489
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.830
and you guys gonna pay me."

490
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.430
And I said okay.

491
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.650
But they lied to me.

492
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.740
They sell with another guy.

493
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.593
And the other guy put us in the trunk

494
00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:28.777
and they put the key and locked.

495
00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:33.287
And when we wanna pass
one border. the dogs.

496
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.730
The dogs smelled us.

497
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.633
Immigration stopped them. thank God.

498
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.563
I can breathe.

499
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.330
- Now. there's a spot across the street

500
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.330
where illegal aliens hang out

501
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.541
to get picked up for cheap labor.

502
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:57.550
(soft music)
(birds chirping)

503
00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.600
On July 12th. 2012.

504
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.900
my husband. Anthony. and I
had just arrived in Atlanta

505
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.600
on a red-eye flight from California.

506
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.977
We went to a Waffle
House and had breakfast.

507
00:28:09.977 --> 00:28:12.690
And as we were going to the car.

508
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.140
I felt like somebody unplugged me.

509
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.033
I dropped to the ground.
almost passed out.

510
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.810
- Dominic Durden was riding his motorcycle

511
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.770
on Pigeon Pass Road in Moreno Valley.

512
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:24.970
He was on his way to work

513
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.480
as a Riverside County
Sheriff's Dispatcher.

514
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.600
A vehicle being driven by an illegal alien

515
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.350
turned left in front of him.

516
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.330
And he was thrown from his motorcycle.

517
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.310
and killed on impact.

518
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.373
- And I dialed his number.
and nobody picked up.

519
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.800
And then I called his work.

520
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.800
where the supervisor
of Dominic informed us

521
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.593
that Dominic was killed that morning.

522
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.160
at the exact time where I passed out

523
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.524
in front of the Waffle House.

524
00:28:59.524 --> 00:29:02.120
(somber music)

525
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.860
There were two Marines
that were behind him

526
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.060
in their cars going to work.

527
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.560
He stopped. he ran over.

528
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.910
When I asked him. I said.
"Did he know you were there?"

529
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.990
He said. "No. he wasn't alive anymore.

530
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.177
I just talked to him and
covered him with my jacket."

531
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.833
He had just turned 30 years old.

532
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.460
- [Namrata] This story begins
to take a life of its own

533
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.260
once I meet with the
Indian Express journalist.

534
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.093
- I have been covering

535
00:29:31.093 --> 00:29:34.932
this illegal immigration issue since long.

536
00:29:34.932 --> 00:29:37.880
Gurpreet's case is a freak case.

537
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.080
which has brought into light

538
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.180
so many other such cases
happened in the past.

539
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.480
Human trafficking problem.

540
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.500
We have a huge network of
unscrupulous travel agents.

541
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.610
So such agents can be me. can be you.

542
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.070
can be a shopkeeper. can be a retired cop.

543
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.517
Then. these sub-agents.
they have their contacts

544
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.320
in different countries.

545
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.580
Maybe in Central America.
North African countries.

546
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.120
or Mexico. USA.

547
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.210
This is a chain. right?

548
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.220
- [Namrata] Agents. coyotes. smugglers.

549
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.523
Different names. same work.

550
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.630
- So. he will ask you pay me
half amount or 40% amount.

551
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.600
or sometimes. 60% amount. in advance.

552
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.600
They take some tourist
visa. maybe of Brazil.

553
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.250
Ecuador. Bahamas. any country

554
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:38.083
from where they can
smuggle them into the USA.

555
00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:42.416
After landing in Brazil.
they will take you by a bus

556
00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:46.382
or by truck to some nearby country.

557
00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:51.730
and from there they will start donkeying.

558
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.890
Donkeys are there for
finding safer entry points

559
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.063
to nearby countries.

560
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.817
The Strait of Panama. then
they are going to Costa Rica.

561
00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:07.373
from there Nicaragua. from
there they are going to Mexico.

562
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.630
- [Namrata] Regardless of which
border town they end up in.

563
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.050
the access to cross over is plentiful.

564
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:19.010
Vast open spaces of American soil beckon.

565
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.320
Although the new wall
is under construction.

566
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.570
the old wall randomly
turns into a guardrail

567
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.440
followed by miles of
completely open border.

568
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.728
Here they seek asylum.

569
00:31:30.728 --> 00:31:31.561
(people speaking in foreign language)

570
00:31:31.561 --> 00:31:33.052
- Go . go. go. go. go.

571
00:31:33.052 --> 00:31:33.969
Go. go. go.

572
00:31:37.677 --> 00:31:40.780
All right. all right.
all right. all right.

573
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.663
Bye. amigo.

574
00:31:41.663 --> 00:31:43.160
- Bye.
- Bye.

575
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.470
But are these really the tired. the poor.

576
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.983
the huddled masses
yearning to breathe free?

577
00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:52.669
- It is not poverty

578
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:56.480
which is driving them to
go to foreign countries.

579
00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.020
- [Namrata] The average payment
to a coyote for one person

580
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.420
to illegally immigrate to the US

581
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.610
based on how far the
coyotes have to take them

582
00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.253
and the mode of transportation
goes something like this.

583
00:32:10.965 --> 00:32:15.780
- "And you guys gonna pay me
$12.000." and I said. "Okay."

584
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.730
- Close to $50.000 they spend.

585
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.440
and they will earn that in two years.

586
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.670
- So where are the
people that are claiming

587
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.270
to really be poor getting
the thousands of dollars

588
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.890
to pay the coyotes?

589
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.200
- [Namrata] I decide
to find out for myself

590
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.160
if the truly impoverished
are who we are helping.

591
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.940
when they come to our borders.

592
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.900
even if it's for economic purposes.

593
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.817
(speaking in foreign language)

594
00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:48.588
(man speaking in foreign language)

595
00:32:48.588 --> 00:32:51.535
(all laughing)

596
00:32:51.535 --> 00:32:53.100
Just like most other the world.

597
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.180
there seem to be six basic levels

598
00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.953
of socio-economic status in India.

599
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.600
The super rich. the rich.
the upper middle class.

600
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.750
the middle class. the
low income. and the poor.

601
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.478
- [Anju] Somebody from a poor state

602
00:33:09.478 --> 00:33:10.613
cannot afford to go there.

603
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.648
Secondly. they don't have that money.

604
00:33:13.648 --> 00:33:14.481
(soft music)

605
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:16.773
- [Namrata] Arvind Singh
works as a gardener.

606
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.960
Nanni and Ramvati work in
different homes as house cleaners.

607
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.143
Dharmender works as a housekeeper.

608
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.700
All three belong to the
lower income class in India.

609
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.751
one step up from the truly impoverished.

610
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:34.149
(birds chirping)

611
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:38.066
(speaking in foreign language)

612
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.030
- [Namrata] They're all
struggling to make ends meet.

613
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.730
but still appear happy and optimistic.

614
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.330
When asked if money was not an issue.

615
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.340
would they want to make
the trek to the West

616
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.973
so they could earn more money?

617
00:34:11.187 --> 00:34:15.104
(speaking in foreign language)

618
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.530
- [Namrata] If the low
income don't have the money

619
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:58.530
to pay the coyotes. the really
impoverished surely do not.

620
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.760
The poor of these countries
can't even afford three meals

621
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.690
a day. leave alone hefty agent fees

622
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.030
to coyotes and smugglers.

623
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.770
They don't have the kind of
money to immigrate anywhere.

624
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.853
legally or illegally.

625
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.450
So. who are these asylum seekers then?

626
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.270
Why would someone who can afford
to pay thousands of dollars

627
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.630
to coyotes risk their own
and their family's lives

628
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.340
just to work illegally in America?

629
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.505
- The dollar dreams.

630
00:35:25.505 --> 00:35:26.830
(upbeat music)

631
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.150
- [Namrata] It turns out. the
coyotes sell a warped image

632
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.063
of America to potential victims.

633
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.440
Apparently. there is a pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow

634
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.965
and the rainbow ends on American soil.

635
00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:44.200
(speaking in foreign language)

636
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.700
- And just because they
have a huge amount to spend.

637
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.600
- [Man] Posh cars.

638
00:35:50.525 --> 00:35:52.351
- [Kid] People in America are rich.

639
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:53.518
- [Kids] Rich.

640
00:35:55.761 --> 00:35:57.205
- [Kid] America is a developed country

641
00:35:57.205 --> 00:35:59.461
so people in America is rich.

642
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:00.630
(soft music)

643
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.983
- Hunger's a bitch.

644
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.883
After a while. you'll start
to lose your mind over it.

645
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.080
- Hunger is something

646
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:22.173
you really kind of have no
choice but to get used to.

647
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.930
You get used to having
scraps here and there.

648
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.509
and surviving off of it. but it's-

649
00:36:32.509 --> 00:36:34.127
- Used to it?

650
00:36:34.127 --> 00:36:37.023
- [Mandy] In a sense that
you become numb to it.

651
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.030
You have to get to the drop-in
centers or the shelters

652
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.350
by. what. 7:00 a.m.. get in line.

653
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.440
And if you're not there by 9:00 a.m..

654
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.770
you're screwed for anything for the day.

655
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.560
The first thing we get up and think is.

656
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.180
gotta get the tent down.

657
00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.704
because we're not supposed
to have our tent up

658
00:36:56.704 --> 00:36:58.650
during the day.

659
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.650
- Imagine getting in a car and
driving as far as you can go

660
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.960
until you run out of gas.

661
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.560
And wherever you run out of gas.

662
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.400
that's where you're resting for the night.

663
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.290
We just walk until we can't walk anymore.

664
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.090
- A lot of times. we
don't even put the tent up

665
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.900
because we're too tired.

666
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.563
We just sleep right there.

667
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.260
When we first came out here.

668
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:28.260
they literally told us that
if Jonathan didn't have a wife

669
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.910
that he could get help.

670
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:34.150
There's a building here
with a transitional shelter

671
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.860
for homeless veterans.

672
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.970
They can stay there
for what. three months.

673
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.660
while they get housing placement.

674
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.493
- Something like that.

675
00:37:40.493 --> 00:37:43.020
They have a drop-in center. so to speak.

676
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:48.020
where I can do laundry.
I can take showers.

677
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.690
You know. hang out and
watch TV throughout the day.

678
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.623
Grab food.

679
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.503
And the first time I went
in there I asked them.

680
00:37:59.537 --> 00:38:01.650
"If I took a shower. could
she take a shower too?"

681
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.705
And they said. "No."

682
00:38:02.705 --> 00:38:05.205
(guns firing)

683
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.017
- [Mandy] So many people say.

684
00:38:08.017 --> 00:38:09.440
"oh. thank you for your service."

685
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.147
or we wanna honor the veterans."

686
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.603
- Veterans get health care.

687
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.723
That's nice. it's appreciated.

688
00:38:20.126 --> 00:38:23.220
You've got military disability.

689
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.640
that can help. but depending
on where you're living.

690
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.970
that's not really enough either.

691
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.240
I don't know how many
charities we've contacted

692
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.710
and veteran's resources that
said we're not qualified

693
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.010
for assistance or they
don't have the funds.

694
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.550
We're in the wrong area code.

695
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.980
or we're in the wrong zip code.

696
00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.453
or we're in the wrong county.

697
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.150
And it's just excuse after excuse.

698
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.563
I have met many other homeless veterans.

699
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.913
It saddens me. yes.

700
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.380
- We got Army. Navy. Air
force. Marines out here.

701
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.480
- Our troops that are
still fighting right now.

702
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.110
because someday those
troops will be veterans.

703
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.480
Someday those troops
will face the same issues

704
00:39:13.321 --> 00:39:17.330
that I faced when I came
home. which is PTSD.

705
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.713
And not understanding PTSD.

706
00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:22.190
I didn't even think
PTSD existed. honestly.

707
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.850
Because I think we've become very.

708
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:28.500
absolutely too comfortable with this.

709
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.170
you know. with homeless
people on the sidewalk.

710
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.710
- [Namrata] Why do you
think our politicians

711
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.050
are not on the sidewalk
right now talking to you.

712
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.137
understanding your issues
and doing something about it?

713
00:39:36.137 --> 00:39:38.800
- Bourgeoisie and arrogant!

714
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.141
They bourgeoisie and arrogant
and don't have no respect!

715
00:39:42.141 --> 00:39:43.510
(somber music)

716
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.960
- Well. Dominic was more
than just an accident victim.

717
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.293
he was a real pillar of the community.

718
00:39:49.293 --> 00:39:53.920
He'd been an EMT. volunteer
of the year in the city

719
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.860
doing cable shows. he wanted
to be a Sheriff's pilot.

720
00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.810
I mean. he was someone who was a young man

721
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.510
who was going to make a
great impact in the community

722
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.240
for many years.

723
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.270
And then we learned that the
person who caused the collision

724
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.790
was an illegal alien from Guatemala

725
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.640
who had been deported
at least once or twice.

726
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.810
He had previous DUI convictions.

727
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:22.030
and so we had the situation
where a great pillar

728
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.890
of the community was killed by a man

729
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.310
who should not have been in the country.

730
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.403
- [Sabine] And one of Dominic's
friends. a motorcycle cop.

731
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:35.287
he was on his way to work.
he got a call on his radio.

732
00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:37.130
"Fatality on Pigeon Pass."

733
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.030
He went to the accident scene.

734
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.050
and when he arrived. he
saw Dominic's motorcycle.

735
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:43.900
He recognized it.

736
00:40:46.187 --> 00:40:50.043
and he recognized Dominic
laying there. all mangled.

737
00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.563
- It's like we were in
a room full of light.

738
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.800
and all of a sudden. you know.

739
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.570
someone turned off the lights.

740
00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:06.070
There were no lights
coming in from the windows.

741
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.120
It was just dark.

742
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.040
- I'd just lost my son. and
we went to the courthouse

743
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.050
to get some kind of justice
for what just had happened.

744
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:21.120
and then the judge asked the defendant

745
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.603
if he had anything to say
to the mother of his victim.

746
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.790
And he placed his hands
in a praying position.

747
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.510
and told the judge. "God
gives life. God takes life.

748
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.507
I was only on my way to work."

749
00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:37.530
I was so shocked.

750
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.963
I expected. I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to kill him.

751
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.740
anything. any kind of remorse.

752
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.400
Nothing.

753
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.680
- I was in the court when
he was eventually sentenced

754
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.070
to nine months in jail.

755
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:57.290
I can tell you. what sticks
with me most from that day.

756
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:01.150
was that after Mr. Zoon
did not take responsibility

757
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.940
for Dominic's death.
Sabina had to be helped

758
00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.930
out of the courtroom by her friends.

759
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.300
She was overwrought with
grief. she could barely stand.

760
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.643
For the victims. justice
was in no way served.

761
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.470
For Sabina. the only
thing that would be just

762
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.303
would be for Dom. her
only son. to come back.

763
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.370
I think a lot of people
believe that the sentence

764
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.120
should have been much longer.

765
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.570
it certainly should've
been the full nine months.

766
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.500
So. he was let out after about 35 days.

767
00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:36.153
- When my father. he passed away in 2014.

768
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.843
I didn't went to Mexico.

769
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.060
I didn't saw my father
for a long time. years.

770
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.533
Like 20. 25. 26 years.

771
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:54.730
And he write a letter for
me. and he say. "Don't come.

772
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.050
because you don't have papers."

773
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.383
I remember Thanksgiving.

774
00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:07.480
my sister and I. we don't
have money to buy chicken.

775
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.500
Chicken. not even a turkey. chicken.

776
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.393
In my first job that I
found here. at that time.

777
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.680
the government paid them the hour. $6.25.

778
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.933
and they paid me $1.50 a hour.

779
00:43:28.883 --> 00:43:33.883
In our country. sometimes.
we are very poor.

780
00:43:33.965 --> 00:43:36.815
We come here to have a better life.

781
00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:41.815
But when you're here. you
realize it's not like that.

782
00:43:43.346 --> 00:43:48.346
When I send $100. it's
almost 2.000 pesos in Mexico.

783
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.070
So. it's a lot of money.

784
00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.513
It's one of the thing that we still here.

785
00:43:57.747 --> 00:44:01.660
- $1 equal to rupees 70.

786
00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.493
- [Namrata] So. 70 times?

787
00:44:02.493 --> 00:44:03.326
- 70 times.

788
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.810
If you works in the USA for 10 hours.

789
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.977
and he gets $10 per hour.

790
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.823
so after 10 hours he'll get $100.

791
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:19.780
And then he will multiply that $100 by 70.

792
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.130
that means he's earning 7.000 in a day.

793
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.580
- Even if a person goes abroad

794
00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.530
and is working as a taxi driver.

795
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.930
when he comes back. he
would set up a new house.

796
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.600
buy a new car.

797
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.170
- I know one person. I
interviewed him once.

798
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.547
He spent 20 years in the USA.

799
00:44:39.547 --> 00:44:41.449
He went illegally.

800
00:44:41.449 --> 00:44:46.027
And for 20 years he could
not come back to India.

801
00:44:46.027 --> 00:44:51.027
because if he had come. then
he could not have gone back.

802
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.363
So. he decided to live there.

803
00:44:54.363 --> 00:44:58.010
His children. they were
really small when he left.

804
00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.090
and when he came back. they were grown up.

805
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.837
That man had come five years back.

806
00:45:05.837 --> 00:45:08.650
And still he's living a good life.

807
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.500
because he said that he had earned so much

808
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.227
that he can live whole
life very comfortably.

809
00:45:14.227 --> 00:45:15.600
(light ethnic music)

810
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.610
- That is why they want
to go abroad at any cost.

811
00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.830
This is dollar dreams
which they are chasing.

812
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.782
- [Anju] So. what they do. they come back.

813
00:45:23.782 --> 00:45:27.333
they take huge plot. or
they have the land also.

814
00:45:28.193 --> 00:45:31.283
and they make big. big palatial houses.

815
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:37.290
- We keep the money to send
to Mexico to our families.

816
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.310
For us here. maybe it's
not a lot of money.

817
00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:44.192
but for them. yes. it's a lot of money.

818
00:45:44.192 --> 00:45:49.192
But the sad thing here
is. we don't see them.

819
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.233
They pass away. they get sick.

820
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.870
they lost. and we never see them.

821
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.500
- [Namrata] The agents charge
not only to transport them

822
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.730
to American borders. but also
to handle their asylum plea

823
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.660
once they are on US soil.

824
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.660
- Already these agents. they
have contacts with some lawyers

825
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.785
in USA. those who are taking such cases.

826
00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:17.943
Maybe $2.000 or $3.000.

827
00:46:17.943 --> 00:46:20.250
then that lawyer will take their case

828
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.590
with the American court.

829
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.910
Then the case goes on.

830
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:26.920
Sometimes they remain in jail.

831
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.960
sometimes they get permit to work there.

832
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.760
And sometimes they face deportation.

833
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.887
so after coming back. they again try.

834
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.410
- [Namrata] For people looking
for a lifestyle upgrade.

835
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:46.500
undocumented immigration serves
as a monetary investment.

836
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.510
The coyotes serve as
their investment bankers.

837
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:54.090
A flawed. broken American
immigration system.

838
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.413
their investment vehicle.

839
00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.190
- Our exit visa system is non-existent.

840
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:04.030
After 9/11. in 2003.
Congress held hearings.

841
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:08.010
and they were supposed to
create a bi-metric visa system.

842
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:11.522
And here it is 2020 and
they haven't even started.

843
00:47:11.522 --> 00:47:14.850
(ominous music)

844
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.620
Overstaying their tourist visa.

845
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.563
That's a big one and getting bigger.

846
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.384
And what about religious persecution?

847
00:47:23.384 --> 00:47:26.020
- There is no danger
to their lives at all.

848
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.550
While seeking political asylum in the USA.

849
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.783
they are still saying that
there is persecution in India.

850
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.320
Which is not relevant
in the current scenario.

851
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.420
- [Namrata] Although religious persecution

852
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.030
is an authentic problem in
some parts of the world.

853
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.490
unfortunately some people use
it as grounds to seek asylum

854
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.594
even if they're not being persecuted.

855
00:47:50.594 --> 00:47:51.770
(bell clanking)

856
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:55.890
Some other loopholes
appear even more bizarre.

857
00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.480
- People also come into the country

858
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.390
either with a fake marriage

859
00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.310
or sometimes they'll marry their sibling.

860
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:03.870
Then. of course. they separate.

861
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:07.810
And fake work and school visas

862
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.150
that allow them to take
away jobs from Americans.

863
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.810
The Green Card Lottery System

864
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.913
that was meant to address diversity.

865
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:19.030
and is literally picking
names out of a hat.

866
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.870
A thing called the U visa.

867
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:24.080
which allows somebody
that's a victim of a crime

868
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:30.020
but here illegally to get
a permanent visa and stay.

869
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.500
And a lot of those stories are made up.

870
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.240
Many of the people that are coming through

871
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.380
are creating fake families.

872
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.080
Because of the Flores Agreement.

873
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.050
which says children have to
be released after 20 days.

874
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.530
they're renting children.

875
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.500
Once they get through
with their fake family.

876
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.910
they know they're gonna be released.

877
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.760
It's basically catch and release.

878
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.070
Once they're released.

879
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:52.590
they may show up for
some of their hearings.

880
00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:55.180
Months later. they get a determination.

881
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.600
Well. 85 to 95% of the time
that determination says

882
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.020
your asylum claim has been denied.

883
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.970
and please report on. you
know. whatever the date is.

884
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.026
to be deported.

885
00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:07.240
(ominous music)

886
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.840
Well. 2% of them show up.

887
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.990
The rest of them disappear in the country.

888
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.580
never to be seen again.

889
00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.840
- [Namrata] The volume
of fake applications

890
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.060
mires an already stressed system.

891
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:24.060
- Our first son. Drew. was born in 1985.

892
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:29.050
and fast forward 25 years.

893
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.580
he's in San Francisco in law school.

894
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.220
And we get a call one night

895
00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.470
that there's been a terrible accident

896
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.207
and to come to San Francisco right away.

897
00:49:39.207 --> 00:49:40.297
(somber music)

898
00:49:40.297 --> 00:49:42.170
Then he told me that our son was killed

899
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.260
in a traffic collision.
that's all we knew.

900
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.190
The guy never even made
an attempt to stop.

901
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.600
He was in the country illegally.

902
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.773
He accelerated and drove over his body.

903
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.620
My son's helmet. he was on a motorcycle.

904
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.150
had come off. and wedged
under his rear tire.

905
00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.840
So. he backed up. driving
over him a second time.

906
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.970
And then trying to flee down the street

907
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:04.640
he went forward a third time.

908
00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.220
His rear tire was on my son's abdomen

909
00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.237
and five men had to
lift the car off of him.

910
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.470
- [Namrata] I'm in shock.

911
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.000
I don't want to believe
any of this is true.

912
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.060
So. I continue on to
find Gurpreet's family.

913
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.090
hoping that her family's case for asylum

914
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:26.290
will be one of the authentic ones.

915
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:29.500
That I'll find some poverty
or persecution there.

916
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:33.350
that makes sense as to why
her young life was risked

917
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.069
when her family undertook
that awful journey.

918
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:38.670
(light music)

919
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.210
The journalist tells me
that Gurpreet's village

920
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.640
is called Hasanpur.

921
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.480
She's also arranged for me to meet

922
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.173
with Gurpreet's grandfather.

923
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.000
Oh my God.

924
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.200
This movie should be called
"The Quest for Hasanpur."

925
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.210
Hasanpur is nowhere near where
Google Maps tells me it is.

926
00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.550
I am so lost in the hinterland of India.

927
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.610
But I'm strong in my resolve.

928
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:06.580
I will not leave India without
finding Gurpreet's truth.

929
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.250
And then I find the town I'm looking for.

930
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.680
The moment of truth is here.

931
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.460
I use a previously published
article to validate

932
00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.639
that this is indeed
Gurpreet's grandfather.

933
00:51:18.639 --> 00:51:22.556
(speaking in foreign language)

934
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.860
- [Namrata] Apparently.
just like Gurpreet's family.

935
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.700
the majority of asylum
cases are purely a function

936
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.700
of economic upgrade. which in
and of itself. is not a crime.

937
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.340
But when you risk your children's lives

938
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:58.340
purely for material benefit.
then it becomes unacceptable.

939
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.973
As Americans. that's
what should piss us off.

940
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:06.490
My heart breaks for this family.

941
00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:10.390
and for the countless other
families. who've been destroyed.

942
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:14.140
All because people risk lives.
so they can go to America

943
00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.483
to make more money or avail free benefits.

944
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.660
Lured by the lucrative
promises of American messaging.

945
00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.160
some who can't afford smuggler payments

946
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.370
even take out loans to pay for the trek.

947
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:32.780
In the bargain. they mortgage
themselves to the hilt.

948
00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.410
After all. they are told
that once they're in America.

949
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.760
just two years of work

950
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.420
will allow them to pay
back their entire loan.

951
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:45.023
Then. they and their families
can live happily ever after.

952
00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.690
- Raise your hand if your government plan

953
00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.773
would provide coverage for
undocumented immigrants.

954
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.781
(audience applauding)

955
00:53:55.781 --> 00:53:56.614
Okay.

956
00:53:56.614 --> 00:53:59.140
- [Namrata] So here. a
coyote is showing this clip

957
00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:04.030
to undecided immigrants to
convince them that paying $50.000

958
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:08.650
per person is worth it to have
free health care in America

959
00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.990
for the rest of their lives.

960
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:13.480
The danger is down played.

961
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.490
After all. they see is the video

962
00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:19.380
of the easy five-minute
walk from Mexico to America.

963
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.500
What do they have to lose?

964
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.530
What they're not told is that
they stand to lose everything

965
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.340
if they get deported.

966
00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.691
Or worse. die at the
border while crossing.

967
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:32.210
(somber music)

968
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:36.040
On this day alone. the
coyote gets two takers.

969
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.180
Free health care in America?

970
00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.540
Who wouldn't want that. right?

971
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.950
Everyone.

972
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.813
Including the Americans
who've been left behind.

973
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.090
- We have a massive homeless problem.

974
00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.550
We have a massive poverty problem.

975
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:05.523
particularly in the
black American community.

976
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:10.490
Many of the Latinos who
have come here legally.

977
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.060
they're getting pushed aside

978
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.270
because the illegal
alien will work for less.

979
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:18.450
We have a lot of people in this country

980
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:20.180
that are really suffering.

981
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:24.450
Single moms. couple of children.

982
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.900
They could be working two or three jobs.

983
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:31.190
But it's just not enough
to make ends meet.

984
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:34.060
Then some of their taxes are going to pay

985
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.560
for not only people
who are here illegally.

986
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.100
but probably their illegality
is lowering the wages

987
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.950
that this woman could get

988
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:46.903
if they weren't here and there
wasn't a crunch for jobs.

989
00:55:47.853 --> 00:55:50.353
(light music)

990
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:12.270
- It's a permanent sense of
loss that cannot ever be fixed.

991
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.213
- Grief means not having my best friend.

992
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.710
play a prank on me like he
used to. make me laugh. hug me.

993
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.423
call me with exciting news.

994
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:40.960
Grief means that life as it was

995
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.073
the moment before he got killed is over.

996
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:49.453
And grief follows me everywhere.

997
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.320
And grief means that you become
the biggest actress or actor

998
00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:00.320
once you lose your child because
you can't talk about this.

999
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:04.570
or share this constantly.
or cry all the time.

1000
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.323
like I feel like at times.

1001
00:57:08.064 --> 00:57:11.580
On that morning. two lives were taken.

1002
00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.153
Dominic's life and mine.

1003
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.020
- If they have a criminal record.

1004
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.700
the only way you can come
in is to come in illegally.

1005
00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.660
- Some people say. "Wait until
they commit a serious crime."

1006
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:28.820
but others point out
that illegal immigrants

1007
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.970
are by definition law breakers.

1008
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.040
- Before sending them into US territory.

1009
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.600
they take their passports and everything.

1010
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.340
And they will put a simple
letter in their pocket.

1011
00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.830
"Please give us political
asylum. our life is in danger."

1012
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:48.620
- Once those people are in the
country. they create new IDs.

1013
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.220
But it's so easy to get a
driver's license using a fake ID

1014
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.770
that now you have a driver's license.

1015
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.720
So. you now have a government document

1016
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.320
that says who you are when you're not.

1017
00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.430
If we get to the day where
everybody's legalized

1018
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.150
and we're giving these people
a pathway to citizenship.

1019
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.701
now they're basically here
permanently. and protected.

1020
00:58:07.701 --> 00:58:10.201
(light music)

1021
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:13.260
- [Namrata] The scouts helping me in India

1022
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.070
tell me this one guy who
murdered three people.

1023
00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:18.510
Since he had the money.

1024
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.740
he paid coyotes to help him
cross the border into Texas.

1025
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:26.323
His old identity died on
the Mexico-Texas border.

1026
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:31.770
Even with multiple warrants
against him. he can't be found.

1027
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:34.200
He gave a fake name and fake story.

1028
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.350
was allowed into the United States.

1029
00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:38.880
Ultimately his asylum was denied.

1030
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.560
but he never showed up for deportation.

1031
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.363
It's now been seven years.

1032
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:49.557
I'm told. this murderer now
drives a cab in California.

1033
00:58:49.557 --> 00:58:52.224
(ominous music)

1034
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:57.140
- One of the issues of the
southern border is terrorism.

1035
00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.400
Especially if you're a terrorist

1036
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.500
you're gonna take the
path of least resistance.

1037
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.290
Then they're gonna come in.

1038
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:05.260
just walking across where
it's easy for them to do that.

1039
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.010
And we know that 'cause we've
caught people doing that.

1040
00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.630
The amount of drugs coming
across the southern border

1041
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:19.620
is massive and we see it
certainly in the opioid crisis

1042
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.893
that we have now.

1043
00:59:26.235 --> 00:59:30.318
- At one point I was doing
15 Percocet 30s a day.

1044
00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.513
Heroin took its place.

1045
00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.653
So. then I was doing heroin.

1046
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.057
Then coke's available.

1047
00:59:42.729 --> 00:59:44.229
And now the big thing is meth.

1048
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.610
I went to jail for.
like. five or six times.

1049
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.560
- Oh. we don't need a physical barrier

1050
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.140
because 90% of the drugs
come through points of entry.

1051
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.960
The truth is that 90% of the drugs

1052
00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.780
that are seized are
seized at points of entry.

1053
01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.430
- The same day.
- The same day.

1054
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:04.830
- We're half a mile from
the US-Mexico border.

1055
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:08.420
- We have no idea what's
coming across the border

1056
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.593
that we never see.

1057
01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.770
- First it was the coyote.

1058
01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:19.099
and later the cartel.

1059
01:00:19.099 --> 01:00:21.100
The cartel in Gulfo.

1060
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:25.523
And now I have fear of ICE.

1061
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.287
I'm living in the shadows.

1062
01:00:29.287 --> 01:00:32.830
If someone does something to
me or my car or something.

1063
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.920
I can't go to the police.

1064
01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.570
- A lot of crime against
people that are here illegally.

1065
01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:42.500
because people figure
they're not gonna report it.

1066
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.160
A woman named Veronica Cabrera Ramirez.

1067
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.820
She lived up in Northern California.

1068
01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.610
Her boyfriend was illegal

1069
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:52.720
and she reported him
for domestic violence.

1070
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.730
Well. they arrested him.

1071
01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:57.270
Because he had been previously deported.

1072
01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:01.300
ICE got a hit and said we
want him. we'll deport him.

1073
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.240
The Sonoma County sheriff let him go.

1074
01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.700
Sanctuary policy.

1075
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.870
Two weeks later. he murdered Veronica.

1076
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:12.430
Now the irony of that story
is you have all the wokeness

1077
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.310
saying you have to let
every person who's a victim

1078
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:18.910
of domestic violence in
these countries into the US.

1079
01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:22.950
Well. what the hell good is
it if you let them into the US

1080
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:25.820
and then somebody commits
domestic violence here

1081
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.120
and you won't deport them?

1082
01:01:28.445 --> 01:01:32.362
(speaking in foreign language)

1083
01:01:57.010 --> 01:02:00.120
- We know children are dying.
but we don't know who they are

1084
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.460
because the coyote's
not gonna report them.

1085
01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.350
and the family may report them missing.

1086
01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:07.970
which they do sometimes. and
oftentimes their body is found

1087
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.380
in the desert as skeletal remains.

1088
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.690
because they've been
there sometimes for years.

1089
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:17.290
That journey is extremely dangerous.

1090
01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:21.020
Numbers have been thrown
around that 1/3 of the women

1091
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.350
that come on the journey

1092
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:25.770
are sexually assaulted on their way.

1093
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.710
What's happening to a child
that sees something like that?

1094
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:32.960
And then the irony is
that when they get here

1095
01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.300
all of the sudden if we put
them in a detention facility

1096
01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.360
for a couple of days. we hear.

1097
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.330
oh. you've destroyed this child.

1098
01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:44.400
they're now gonna be afraid
for the rest of their lives.

1099
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.010
They just spent three months

1100
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:49.260
in what's horror every single day.

1101
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:51.750
They're concerned where they came from.

1102
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.340
and they're concerned where they end up.

1103
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.021
but they don't give a
damn what happened to them

1104
01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:57.530
in the middle.

1105
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:59.540
- [Namrata] It wasn't always like that.

1106
01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.460
The Bracero Program.
a guest worker program

1107
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.460
which was initiated in
1942 and ended in 1965.

1108
01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.020
allowed Mexican farmworkers
to work in the US

1109
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.550
with decent living conditions
such as sanitation.

1110
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:18.710
adequate shelter and food.
and a guaranteed minimum wage.

1111
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:22.720
But in 1965. it was discontinued.

1112
01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.610
Suppose instead of halting
the Bracero Program.

1113
01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:28.870
Congress had expanded
it to include the world.

1114
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:30.730
but with safeguards.

1115
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:34.910
First. Americans would get
priority for American jobs.

1116
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:38.150
Second. if unable to fulfill job openings.

1117
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.400
employers could bring guest workers

1118
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.350
but had to match the wages
and working conditions

1119
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:45.173
afforded to Americans.

1120
01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.110
It would remove the incentive
for American employers

1121
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:52.933
to hire illegal immigrants.
simply to get cheaper labor.

1122
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.620
But it would still give
employers the opportunity

1123
01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.360
to have a full work force.

1124
01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.343
if Americans were unable
to fill in the open jobs.

1125
01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.980
I look for other countries today

1126
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.432
that might have similar
immigration policies

1127
01:04:08.432 --> 01:04:10.782
to the Bracero Program.

1128
01:04:10.782 --> 01:04:14.197
(upbeat ethnic music)

1129
01:04:14.197 --> 01:04:18.870
The United Arab Emirates is a
flourishing. developed nation.

1130
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:22.480
Dubai. a prominent city in the UAE.

1131
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.083
is a beautiful fusion of ancient
culture and modern luxury.

1132
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.030
The majority of the workforce
that has built Dubai

1133
01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:35.050
are almost exclusively
immigrant guest workers.

1134
01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.680
As employers are unable
to fill certain jobs

1135
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.400
with Emirati citizens

1136
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.210
because of the limited local population.

1137
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:45.260
On the other hand. people
from all around the world

1138
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.890
are willing to work in Dubai
due to the high exchange rate.

1139
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.050
So. Dubai welcomes immigrant workers

1140
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:54.330
from other countries on
legal guest programs.

1141
01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.670
- So my company is being my sponsor.

1142
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:59.893
but bringing me on the basis of work visa.

1143
01:05:00.774 --> 01:05:05.304
(speaking in foreign language)

1144
01:05:05.304 --> 01:05:10.304
- (speaking in foreign language)
1.000 Rupees. Indian money.

1145
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.453
Only 1.000 Rupees.

1146
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.500
But here. we will get
around 30.000 Rupees.

1147
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.023
Like they can make home.
build their family good.

1148
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:24.243
make their children study well.

1149
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:26.860
They'll get more money from here.

1150
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.390
- I think that Dubai. in this context.

1151
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:31.780
they're doing an amazing job.

1152
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.830
That's the reason maybe
they're the business hub

1153
01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.244
of the world.

1154
01:05:35.244 --> 01:05:39.161
(speaking in foreign language)

1155
01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.625
- I like my country so much.

1156
01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:53.920
I will go back. Surely. I will go back.

1157
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.653
after getting some more money.

1158
01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:59.870
Now after 10 or 15 years later.

1159
01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:01.370
I will go back to my country.

1160
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:06.507
(speaking in foreign language)

1161
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.840
- [Namrata] This wealth goes back

1162
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.550
into the worker's home nation
and not only helps the worker

1163
01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:19.970
with better economic
upgrades when they return.

1164
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:22.940
but also benefits their
countries directly.

1165
01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.030
Countries that could certainly use a hand.

1166
01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:27.170
It is estimated

1167
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:30.650
that approximately eight
million foreign nationals

1168
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:33.224
live and work legally in the UAE.

1169
01:06:33.224 --> 01:06:34.810
(hopeful music)

1170
01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:35.650
It is estimated

1171
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:38.750
that approximately 10
million foreign nationals

1172
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.793
live and work illegally in the USA.

1173
01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.142
Imagine if like the UAE.

1174
01:06:46.142 --> 01:06:49.410
the United States was willing
to let these 10 million

1175
01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:53.410
or more illegal immigrants
come through legally.

1176
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.670
on guest worker programs.
without risking their own

1177
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:59.360
or their family's lives
to cross the border.

1178
01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.260
Imagine if we could
document these workers.

1179
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.910
not only to run criminal records.

1180
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:09.013
but also to let them come here.
work and live with dignity.

1181
01:07:10.174 --> 01:07:12.660
(speaking in foreign language)

1182
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.040
Where they would not be afraid

1183
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.660
to report a crime against them.

1184
01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:21.083
Where they could have a job
that pays a fair. livable wage.

1185
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.390
Where the American worker
would get first priority

1186
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:27.370
to fill any jobs in America.

1187
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:31.700
Where if any jobs are left
unfulfilled by American workers.

1188
01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.440
the guest workers could
help the US economy

1189
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.020
while still investing in and retiring

1190
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.370
in their home countries.
all without partaking

1191
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:43.360
in any of the welfare
or retirement benefits

1192
01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.373
so desperately needed
for American citizens.

1193
01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.870
One of the problems that's
often cited with foreign aid

1194
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:04.670
is that the money never makes
it past the corruption chains

1195
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.880
of local politicians.

1196
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.890
Here. the people invest in
their communities directly.

1197
01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:13.373
and bypass any corruption.

1198
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.100
We can take care of our own first

1199
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.750
and still get to help
those around the world

1200
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.560
that need it most.

1201
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.650
With no lives risked
through illegal immigration.

1202
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:27.240
Sounds like a win-win to me.

1203
01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.880
- The United States is
running concentration camps

1204
01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.620
on our southern border.

1205
01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:36.940
And that is exactly what they are.

1206
01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.440
They are concentration camps.

1207
01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.120
- Politicians like AOC.
trashing the border patrol.

1208
01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.563
and likened it to concentration camps.

1209
01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:50.980
I'm also Jewish. but to call
them concentration camps

1210
01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:54.410
is an insult to all the people that died

1211
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:57.690
in concentration camps
or were there at all.

1212
01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:59.373
- Haven't seen any politicians.

1213
01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.030
Haven't seen any politicians.

1214
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:04.610
I've seen reporters out here.

1215
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:08.820
I've seen very few liaisons out here.

1216
01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:11.670
You can either disgrace your veterans.

1217
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.605
or you can honor your veterans.

1218
01:09:13.605 --> 01:09:14.438
(revealing music)
- Yes!

1219
01:09:14.438 --> 01:09:17.150
- I want our politicians to understand

1220
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:20.240
that when our troops who
support the very freedom

1221
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.200
that gets abused everyday so radically

1222
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.700
in ways that is mind-blowing.

1223
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.740
I want our politicians to recognize

1224
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.720
that this is what is crippling
and destroying freedom

1225
01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.340
and liberty in America today.

1226
01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.570
- We have sacrificed our lives.

1227
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:40.330
we have sacrificed our blood.

1228
01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.720
we have sacrificed our families.

1229
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.670
- [Namrata] What is your
message to politicians

1230
01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.826
in the 2020 election?

1231
01:09:45.826 --> 01:09:47.770
- Get their head out their bottoms.

1232
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:52.700
- We're fed a narrative that
makes a compassionate person.

1233
01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.993
which we are. I think we're
a very compassionate country.

1234
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.360
it misplaces the compassion.

1235
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.050
It's certainly okay to feel for people

1236
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:07.080
that live in poor situations.
violent situations.

1237
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.230
and I think as a people
we want to help them.

1238
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:12.580
The reality of it is. there's
probably two billion people

1239
01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.700
in the world that fit into that category

1240
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.250
and we can't bring them all here.

1241
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:18.720
- [Namrata] Who knows compassion

1242
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.440
better than the Dalai Lama?

1243
01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.740
Not politically correct
compassion. but real compassion.

1244
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.440
Because of the COVID-19 circumstances.

1245
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.880
I can't interview him in person.

1246
01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.730
But I do find an interview
with him on this subject.

1247
01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:37.730
- European countries
should take these refugees

1248
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:42.920
and give them education and training.

1249
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.513
and then aiming is
return to their own land.

1250
01:10:48.132 --> 01:10:51.220
- And if these people
want to stay in Europe.

1251
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.670
shouldn't they be allowed to?

1252
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.263
- Limited number okay.

1253
01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.850
But whole Europe eventually
become Muslim country.

1254
01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:04.230
impossible. or African country.
also impossible. (laughs)

1255
01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.063
- There's nothing wrong
with that. is there?

1256
01:11:05.063 --> 01:11:07.320
I mean you're a refugee yourself.

1257
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.808
- They themselves I think
better to their own land.

1258
01:11:09.808 --> 01:11:11.880
(soft music)

1259
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.840
- [Namrata] Have we taken the easy route

1260
01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.360
of misplaced compassion.
instead of doing the hard work

1261
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.830
to actually determine how and who we hurt

1262
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:24.593
rather than help by not
enforcing our immigration laws?

1263
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.540
And have we let Americans
down in the bargain?

1264
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.053
And if so. why?

1265
01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.450
- One of the things that's
beneficial to politicians

1266
01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:40.560
with illegal immigration.
besides the money which they get

1267
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.540
from the federal government.
is legislative positions.

1268
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.640
All the states that have big
illegal alien populations.

1269
01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.750
the way the law works.

1270
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:54.210
they get counted and
represented by Congress.

1271
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:58.690
If California didn't have
any illegal aliens here.

1272
01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.640
those seats would go elsewhere.

1273
01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.410
Plus. the funding. whether
it's extra school funding

1274
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:06.580
or crime funding.

1275
01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.530
a lot of it's based on
pure numbers of people.

1276
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:11.490
doesn't matter what their status is.

1277
01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:14.253
The public would be outraged
if they knew the truth.

1278
01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:17.350
- [Namrata] The irresponsible messaging

1279
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:20.100
does not end with the politicians.

1280
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.410
Some of our media is as much to blame.

1281
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:26.360
For example. CNN covered Gurpreet's story

1282
01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.810
two days after I did.

1283
01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:32.530
The CNN article clearly
states that Gurpreet's father

1284
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:35.210
is seeking asylum in America.

1285
01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:38.100
but they failed to report
on the visible lack

1286
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.420
of asylum circumstances.

1287
01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.230
Why wouldn't the reporter
have reported that?

1288
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:45.730
It makes America look like the culprit.

1289
01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:49.400
while fully ignoring the
perpetrators. the coyotes.

1290
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.398
who are the real ones to blame.

1291
01:12:51.398 --> 01:12:52.620
(soft music)

1292
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.827
- I still have nightmares.

1293
01:12:55.918 --> 01:13:00.918
I still have sometimes depression.

1294
01:13:01.557 --> 01:13:03.307
I still have anxious.

1295
01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:07.114
And I still have insomnia.

1296
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:13.303
Sometimes I wake up if
I hear a little noise

1297
01:13:14.665 --> 01:13:17.443
or I hear the helicopter or something.

1298
01:13:17.443 --> 01:13:18.595
I just wake up.

1299
01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:19.912
(helicopter chopping)

1300
01:13:19.912 --> 01:13:24.912
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)

1301
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.720
- [Sabine] Every night I sit
and I look up at the sky.

1302
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.103
and I talk to my son.

1303
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.883
That day. Dominic turned into a star.

1304
01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.160
And Dominic. my baby. became
engraved on this rock.

1305
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:47.630
- Pat Tillman was a
professional football player

1306
01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.990
and after September 11th happened.

1307
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:52.290
he makes millions of dollars.

1308
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:54.200
he decided that he was going anyway.

1309
01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.860
And on his deployment. he was killed.

1310
01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:59.483
It was a time when this country needed-

1311
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:05.230
- Some heroes.
- Needed some heroes.

1312
01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:07.783
And he answered that call.

1313
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.270
I love the country.

1314
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:12.193
I do. I love it.

1315
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:17.000
I think the United States of America

1316
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.093
has let the veterans down.

1317
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.720
It would be nice if people
thought about it for a minute.

1318
01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.720
what life would be like
had people not laid down

1319
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:34.560
the ultimate sacrifice
and given up their lives.

1320
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.160
so that people could have these freedoms.

1321
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.040
- The Bible is the one
thing I can always go to.

1322
01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.270
It's really one of the few things

1323
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.910
that keeps me from losing my shit.

1324
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:46.297
for lack of a better word.

1325
01:14:46.297 --> 01:14:47.840
(intriguing music)

1326
01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.910
- [Namrata] Countless Americans have died

1327
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:54.360
at the protection of America
and what it stands for.

1328
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.370
One of our greatest
freedoms that we fought for.

1329
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:00.610
and that we have. is that of free speech

1330
01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:02.573
and the ability to tell the truth.

1331
01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.530
But in today's world of cancel culture.

1332
01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.373
it's hard to call out the truth.

1333
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:12.610
I almost didn't make this film.

1334
01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:16.690
because my friends. my industry
colleagues. even my family.

1335
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:20.210
all rallied against the
final message of this film

1336
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.919
just because it did not
align with their world view.

1337
01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:25.586
(intense music)

1338
01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.460
But what this film has taught me

1339
01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.020
is that sticking to a
message that endangers lives.

1340
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:37.020
intentionally or not. is
not being a humanitarian.

1341
01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:39.730
It doesn't matter if the
journey begins in India.

1342
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:43.730
Central America. Africa. or
another part of the world.

1343
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:48.053
the stories are the same.
only the faces change.

1344
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:52.890
What this film has also taught me

1345
01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:55.060
is that ignoring the constant abuse

1346
01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.720
of America's noble asylum policies

1347
01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.330
does far more harm than good.

1348
01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:03.070
And that lumping illegal immigration

1349
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:06.360
with America's generous
immigration principles

1350
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.903
is the dishonor of the word immigrant.

1351
01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:13.430
- [Sabine] I want people
to know and understand

1352
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:19.120
that legal immigration is okay.

1353
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.120
It's what America needs. every
country needs immigration.

1354
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.630
- [Namrata] But if I'm
going to call out the truth.

1355
01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:29.320
then I must acknowledge

1356
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.540
that one can be against
illegal immigration

1357
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:36.573
and still be immigration
supportive and immigration proud.

1358
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:40.023
The two are not the same.

1359
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:43.190
- [Sabine] When I came
to the United States.

1360
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:45.670
I was a registered democrat.

1361
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:49.490
- I registered as a
democrat when I was 18.

1362
01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:52.783
and I still am 50 years later.

1363
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.473
I'm still a democrat. I still
consider myself a liberal.

1364
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.410
- [Namrata] Although this
film hasn't swayed me

1365
01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.500
from leaving the Democratic party.

1366
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:07.230
we as moderate democrats
have a lot of work to do.

1367
01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:12.230
- Had the person who was here illegally

1368
01:17:14.976 --> 01:17:16.740
(soft music)

1369
01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.963
not have been here illegally

1370
01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:28.730
he would not have killed
Dominic on that day.

1371
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:33.690
- [Sabine] I hear a
lot about people saying

1372
01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.730
it was just an accident.

1373
01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.610
he could've been killed by an American.

1374
01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:42.290
and I agree. he could
have. but he was not.

1375
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:46.530
He was killed by somebody that
was not supposed to be here.

1376
01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:48.283
wasn't allowed to be here.

1377
01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:54.170
- And whoever is responsible
for illegals being here.

1378
01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.410
are kind of responsible
for all of the damage

1379
01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:05.110
and all of the harm and all of the hurt.

1380
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:10.110
the destruction that is caused
by just them being here.

1381
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:16.040
- [Namrata] Several pieces of legislation

1382
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.160
introduced in 2020 by Democrats.

1383
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.940
some by women of color
like me. has stunned me

1384
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:26.223
and thrown my support for the
Democratic party in a spiral.

1385
01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.140
Not only do I think these
irresponsible messages

1386
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.950
dangle more carrots in front
of unsuspecting victims.

1387
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:37.050
but proposals like The New Way Forward Act

1388
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:39.600
basically ask for a radical change

1389
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.960
to our immigration policy.

1390
01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.810
A change that would protect

1391
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.986
criminal immigrants from deportation.

1392
01:18:45.986 --> 01:18:47.200
(soft music)

1393
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.170
My first thought. another
bait the smugglers can use

1394
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:53.013
to snare in more victims.

1395
01:18:53.013 --> 01:18:54.040
(sheep bleating)

1396
01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:59.040
My next thought. the cries of
those who will become victims

1397
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:03.003
of the unintended consequences
of this messaging.

1398
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:09.950
- I was thinking that to come to America

1399
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:14.950
is gonna be very easy. very
happy. very comfortable.

1400
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.350
And it wasn't like that.

1401
01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.200
I think I was gonna have a lot of clothes.

1402
01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.630
I'm gonna have a lot of food.

1403
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:26.580
I'm going to Disneyland.

1404
01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.273
I've never went to Disneyland.

1405
01:19:29.273 --> 01:19:33.190
(speaking in foreign language)

1406
01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.437
- Everything that I hear
over there in Mexico

1407
01:19:40.437 --> 01:19:43.763
that I'm gonna have here. it's a lie.

1408
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:49.306
- [Namrata] This irresponsible
messaging has to stop.

1409
01:19:49.306 --> 01:19:53.010
(raindrops pattering)
(thunder rumbling)

1410
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.350
- [Sabine] What if this was your child?

1411
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:56.183
Think about it.

1412
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:03.393
- We're so worried about
other countries' problems.

1413
01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.183
and we don't even focus on our own.

1414
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:12.323
- [Namrata] Jonathan is
still looking for a job.

1415
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:23.580
But politics appears to trump poverty

1416
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.023
in this election cycle.

1417
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.690
Joe Biden now calls the
Obama era deportations

1418
01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:31.570
a "big mistake."

1419
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:34.040
Mr. Biden. who voted in favor

1420
01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.040
of the Secure Fence Act of
2006. is now for open borders.

1421
01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:43.570
And Joe Biden credits the
people coming on H1B visas

1422
01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:45.323
to have built this country.

1423
01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:50.020
Mr. Biden. America was built by the blood

1424
01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.280
and sweat of Americans.

1425
01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.320
African Americans. Hispanic
Americans. Asian Americans.

1426
01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.573
Caucasian Americans. and the
many others. but all American.

1427
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:04.360
They need employment first.

1428
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.350
So. now you've got illegal immigrants

1429
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:09.120
taking up blue-collar jobs for cheaper.

1430
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.800
And H1B visa holders

1431
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.700
taking up white-collar jobs for cheaper.

1432
01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.010
I understand that a
corporation's goal is profit.

1433
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.720
so cheaper labor helps corporations.

1434
01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.624
I get that.

1435
01:21:20.624 --> 01:21:22.260
(intriguing music)

1436
01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:26.683
But. in the meantime. what
are the American kids to do?

1437
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:31.270
America is not for sale.

1438
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:35.020
If this is where the
Democratic party is in 2020.

1439
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.430
I will not vote for Joe Biden.

1440
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:40.310
And if we don't start
putting Americans first.

1441
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:43.893
the Democratic party will
lose more moderates like me.

1442
01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.800
So. in the America of the 21st century.

1443
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.090
we must be willing to ask.

1444
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:54.700
how do we define the tired.
the poor. the huddled masses?

1445
01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.933
Who do we take in?

1446
01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.730
Because there are billions who qualify.

1447
01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:02.800
but those who need help most

1448
01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.370
don't even appear to even
make it to our borders.

1449
01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:09.813
They remain on the other
side of the tracks.

1450
01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:15.080
Nobody wins. except the
coyotes. the corporations.

1451
01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.240
and possibly. the politicians.

1452
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.840
As I traveled through
the last part of Mexico

1453
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.200
to get to the Lukeville
border patrol check point.

1454
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.080
I reflected on the innocence
of this little child.

1455
01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.350
who didn't know what was in store for her.

1456
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:33.420
less than an hour later.

1457
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.750
As I walked through the spot

1458
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:37.710
where six-year-old
Gurpreet's body was found.

1459
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:40.330
it all came together for me.

1460
01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:45.330
Gurpreet. Dominic. Jonathan.
Maria. they were all victims

1461
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:50.020
of America's utterly
broken immigration system.

1462
01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:54.930
As of last contact. Jonathan
is still looking for a job.

1463
01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:57.750
He has recently been to the Mexican border

1464
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.890
to seek cheaper drugs.

1465
01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:03.570
This very border still
traffics many other Marias

1466
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:05.200
to their nightmare.

1467
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.200
American and foreign nationals
still die every month.

1468
01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.670
either at the hands of someone

1469
01:23:11.670 --> 01:23:14.300
who has illegally crossed this border

1470
01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.910
or under the harsh
conditions of this border

1471
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.950
while trying to cross illegally.

1472
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:23.550
Gurpreet's legacy is that we think through

1473
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.920
what appears to be good intentions

1474
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.690
and consider the potential ramifications

1475
01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:31.420
of our misplaced compassion.

1476
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:35.100
Gurpreet's legacy is that we
consider America's impoverished

1477
01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.100
along with the rest of the world

1478
01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:41.080
and make smart. non-partisan
political choices.

1479
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:45.580
Gurpreet's legacy is that we
remember to put out messaging

1480
01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:50.137
that does not forget who we
hurt while we try to help.

1481
01:23:50.137 --> 01:23:52.970
("Amazing Grace")
