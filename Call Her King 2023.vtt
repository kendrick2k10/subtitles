I uh. you know. believe it

927
00:55:15.827 --> 00:55:18.068
when I first got on the bench.

Yes.

Yes.

could pick the defendant

could be found

at several murder scenes.
correct?

993
00:59:00.931 --> 00:59:03.275
But what you
didn't tell the jury

994
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.724
is that the initial test
came back negative

995
00:59:05.758 --> 00:59:06.758
and inconclusive.

996
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:08.310
No. I didn't.

997
00:59:10.275 --> 00:59:12.689
And the samples only
came back positive.

998
00:59:12.724 --> 00:59:15.137
because the defendant's sample
was compromised.

999
00:59:17.862 --> 00:59:19.137
I didn't know that.

1000
00:59:19.172 --> 00:59:20.689

did you read the report
carefully

00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:21.689
or just the conclusion?

1002
00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.103
The conclusion.

1003
00:59:23.137 --> 00:59:24.689

How do you know that
he didn't do it?

1025
01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.172

was being killed.

wouldn't even let us testify.

1031

He even threatened
to split us up.

1032

the hardest.
