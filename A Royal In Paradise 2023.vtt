00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:46.541
Um... excuse me. I'm so sorry
to disturb you. but are you...

4
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:49.500
Ah yes. I think I might be.

5
00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.023
Oh my gosh! Olivia!

6
00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.896
I mean...
I'm sorry. Miss Perkins.

7
00:01:54.592 --> 00:01:57.465
I just... I wanted to tell you
how much I adored <i>Love Bound.</i>

8
00:01:57.508 --> 00:01:59.075
I couldn't put it down.

9
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.164
That's so nice. thank you.

10
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.905
And Olivia is fine.

11
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:04.776
Um... would you mind?

12
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.735
Oh yes. of course.

13
00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:07.823
Let's see here.

14
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.482
Thank you so much!

15
00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:15.961
I can't wait for the next one!

16
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:17.789
Yeah. just working on it.

17
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.618
Cute.

18
00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:29.932
Oh hey stranger.

19
00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:33.022
Sorry. Been on a five hour Zoom
with the dev team.

20
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:36.068
Yeah. that's OK. I get it.
I have a surprise for you.

21
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:40.160
Ta-da!

22
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.553
Happy early anniversary!

23
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:46.688
Oh.

24
00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:50.039
Olivia. I don't...

25
00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.930
I know what you're thinking.
we are both crazy busy.

26
00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:54.652
But. come on. we spent years
talking about this place.

27
00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:55.827
and I think we've earned it.

28
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:57.264
Your app is blowing up.

29
00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:58.961
I got the green light
on my next book.

30
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.659
Babe. we always promised
each other we would do this.

31
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.750
Get away. finally have a real
adventure together.

32
00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.101
What do you say?

33
00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.755
Olivia...

34
00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.714
I'm sorry. I...

35
00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:15.238
I actually think it might be
best if we broke up.

36
00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:20.156
I'm sorry. what?

37
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.916
It's like you said.
you have the new book coming up

38
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.247
and this app is eating up
all of my time.

39
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.988
I just think we're on
different paths

40
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:27.250
in our lives right now and...

41
00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:30.079
OK. let me get this straight...

42
00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:32.299
I am here booking
our anniversary vacation.

43
00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.649
and you are breaking up with me?

44
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.914
I've thought about it a lot.
and I think it's for the best.

45
00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:40.263
Wh...

46
00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:42.047
I promise this isn't easy for me
either.

47
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.614
OK. but...

48
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:44.939
Look. the last thing
either of us wants right now

49
00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:46.269
is to say something
we'll regret.

50
00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:48.880
- But...
- I'm gonna give you some space.

51
00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:51.535
I'm really sorry. Olivia.

52
00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:00.675
Me again! I almost forgot.
can... can I get a photo?

53
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.723
Thanks!

54
00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:19.389
<i>So. darling.
how's the outline coming along?</i>

55
00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:20.999
Yeah. good. Great.

56
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:22.784
Just chipping away at it.

57
00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:23.872
<i>Wonderful.</i>

58
00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:25.743
<i>Can I know what it's about yet?</i>

59
00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:28.572
Yeah sure. It's... um... just...

60
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.013
You know what. I still have some
minor details to work out.

61
00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:38.408
<i>Dear. I hate to be a pest
and you know I adore your work.</i>

62
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:40.454
<i>but you have had
three extensions.</i>

63
00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:42.325
I know.

64
00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:43.911
<i>You are slated as our biggest
release of the season.</i>

65
00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:46.111
<i>Your fans want a new story</i>

66
00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:48.636
<i>with that trademark
Olivia Perkins voice.</i>

67
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.334
<i>Travel. adventure.
sizzling passion and romance.</i>

68
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:53.728
<i>I mean. we don't exactly need to
reinvent the wheel here.</i>

69
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.252
You're right.
I just need a little more time.

70
00:04:56.948 --> 00:04:58.820
<i>I understand.</i>

71
00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:00.363
<i>And you know I have nothing
but respect for the process.</i>

72
00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.650
<i>but I'm gonna need that outline
soon.</i>

73
00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:04.347
<i>Within 10 days.</i>

74
00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:06.741
Sorry. did you say 10 days?

75
00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:08.327
<i>Otherwise we'll need to bump
your release</i>

76
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.092
<i>and give your slot
to another author.</i>

77
00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.094
<i>I'm sorry. darling.</i>

78
00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:13.182
I...

79
00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:16.272
I will figure it out.

80
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.404
Don't worry.

81
00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:19.014
<i>Excellent. I'll be waiting.</i>

82
00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:20.320
OK.

83
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.045
Come in.

84
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.178
Morning. Your Highness.

85
00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:54.832
Morning Winston.

86
00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:58.508
You don't need to do that.
you know?

87
00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:00.142
I can manage.

88
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.013
I am bound by Royal protocols.
sir.

89
00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:16.288
A worthy read. sir?

90
00:06:16.332 --> 00:06:17.377
Fantastic.

91
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.467
Adventure. mystery...

92
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.730
romance.

93
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:28.997
Don't suppose you see any of
that on my itinerary?

94
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.999
Doubtful. sir.

95
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:34.176
Tonight you and her majesty
are dining with the ambassador.

96
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.005
Then over the next
couple of days.

97
00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:39.442
you'll be expected to
accompany her to the UN.

98
00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:43.272
followed by social engagements
at the Guggenheim and the Met.

99
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:45.143
After that. well...

100
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:47.774
it won't be too long before
we'll have to fly back

101
00:06:47.798 --> 00:06:49.887
to Torovia for the palace ball
in a week.

102
00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:53.282
Winston. we need a holiday.

103
00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:57.155
- A prince's work is never done.
- Mm.

104
00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:02.683
However. the Palace did pass on
this letter from Dr Lee.

105
00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:15.783
We're invited to a fundraiser
at the Haven Reserve.

106
00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:17.175
Saturday week.

107
00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:20.614
Marvelous.
It's been far too long.

108
00:07:21.397 --> 00:07:23.704
- Can we attend?
- Sadly not. sir.

109
00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:25.836
It will clash with the ball.

110
00:07:30.145 --> 00:07:31.407
'Course it will.

111
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.106
Ah. Alexander!

112
00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:37.239
Hello mother.

113
00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:39.565
I'm glad you're back.
I've actually just rece...

114
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:41.069
Just one moment. darling.

115
00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:42.829
I've just come from breakfast
at the Waldorf

116
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:46.422
and you'll never guess who
I happened to cross path with.

117
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.989
Lady Renshaw.

118
00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.121
Catherine?

119
00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:51.490
It was lovely to see her again.
wasn't it Ridley?

120
00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:52.646
Oh absolutely. Ma'am.

121
00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:54.517
I passed on your regards.

122
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.364
I can already tell we're going
to have a wonderful time

123
00:07:56.388 --> 00:07:58.478
when we catch up properly
next week.

124
00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.089
Next week?

125
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:03.265
Well. I invited her
to the palace ball.

126
00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:05.267
It's going to be a splendid
evening.

127
00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:08.270
Mother. we've been over this.

128
00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:10.533
There was simply no...

129
00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:13.536
spark between Catherine and I.

130
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.019
Don't be foolish. Alexander.
you two are a perfect match.

131
00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.544
Besides. the people of Torovia
expected their prince

132
00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:23.503
to be long since married by now.

133
00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:26.767
How could I forget?

134
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.281
More importantly. darling...

135
00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:35.645
some are like Catherine
could make you very happy.

136
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:38.953
I want to know that you're going
to be looked after.

137
00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:41.129
It's a very lonely job
being a Head of State.

138
00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:43.348
Pardon me. Ma'am.
but the car is here.

139
00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:44.654
Thank you. Ridley.

140
00:08:45.612 --> 00:08:47.135
Once we're back in Torovia

141
00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:49.026
and you've had a chance
to catch up. you'll see...

142
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.574
Mother. I'm terribly sorry.
but I've just realised...

143
00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:54.335
the ball is going to clash
with my appearance

144
00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:55.447
at Dr Lee's fundraiser.

145
00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:56.710
What?

146
00:08:57.711 --> 00:08:58.886
What fundraiser?

147
00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:00.061
On the Haven Isles.

148
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.890
Isn't that right. Winston?

149
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.242
That's... right. Your Highness.

150
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:13.441
- Why was I not informed of this?
- I'll look into this immediate...

151
00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:15.487
There must have been a hiccup
somewhere along the line.

152
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.426
but they are expecting me.

153
00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:20.995
And I'll be frightfully
embarrassed if I have to cancel

154
00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:22.692
and cause a PR mess.

155
00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:24.564
Very well.

156
00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:27.741
Mark my words. Alexander.

157
00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:30.961
when you're king
you won't be able to waste time

158
00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:33.616
on these personal fancies.

159
00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:37.533
Heaven above. you're worse
than your father was.

160
00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:43.191
Thank you. Mother.

161
00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:48.544
Winston. do me a favour and RSVP
to Dr Lee's fundraiser will you?

162
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.242
Sir. palace subterfuge rarely...

163
00:09:54.724 --> 00:09:56.378
Very well. sir.

164
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:11.001
OK. Olivia. you got this.

165
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:07.797
Don't ask.

166
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:15.109
Sir. your coffee.

167
00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.856
- There you go.
- Thank you.

168
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:26.947
So embarrassing.
I was somewhere else entirely.

169
00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:28.794
Oh gosh. Are you alright?
Yeah. yeah.

170
00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:30.080
- Don't worry about it.
- OK.

171
00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:34.041
Strangely enough.
I actually just finished this.

172
00:11:34.084 --> 00:11:35.564
Yeah. I've heard mixed things.

173
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:37.871
Really?

174
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.100
I think it's her best yet.
I loved every second.

175
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:45.095
Oh... ah...

176
00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:48.533
Pardon me.

177
00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:53.538
Have we met before?

178
00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.890
I don't think so.

179
00:12:00.197 --> 00:12:02.286
Ah... anyway...

180
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.724
Well. maybe next time.

181
00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:09.380
Thank you.

182
00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:28.051
Anything the matter. sir?

183
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.156
Special delivery.
Brought you food.

184
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.028
Thank you. but I'm not hungry.

185
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:49.594
Still gotta eat.

186
00:12:50.726 --> 00:12:53.250
Every time I try
and write something romantic.

187
00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:55.426
emotional or passionate.
I just hit a wall.

188
00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.386
Then I usually take a nap.

189
00:12:58.429 --> 00:12:59.972
Give it time.
you can't rush these things.

190
00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:01.693
- Here.
- Mm-mm.

191
00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:03.565
OK.

192
00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:05.088
Mm...

193
00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:06.307
taking a vacation?

194
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.874
- Hm?
- Mm.

195
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.702
No. that was a surprise
anniversary vacation

196
00:13:10.746 --> 00:13:13.227
I booked for Kyle right before
he said we needed to break up.

197
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:17.492
We always promised each other
we would get away.

198
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:19.015
See something new.
have an adventure.

199
00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:21.975
But. surprise. suddenly he is on
a different path.

200
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:29.199
Hey.

201
00:13:29.939 --> 00:13:31.027
Are you OK?

202
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:35.815
I don't know.

203
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:41.037
I know I will get over Kyle
but...

204
00:13:43.387 --> 00:13:44.780
what if this is permanent?

205
00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:47.870
What if I can't write anymore?

206
00:13:47.914 --> 00:13:49.263
Don't worry.

207
00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:52.875
You'll get your groove back.
I promise.

208
00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:01.666
Why don't we go?

209
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:05.105
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. it will be great.

210
00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:06.256
You can still have
your adventure

211
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.977
and I could use the break.

212
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.433
We just wrapped
on spring fashion launch.

213
00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:11.067
and I am exhausted!

214
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:12.416
- Katie...
- Mm-hm.

215
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.070
You know I have this deadline?

216
00:14:14.114 --> 00:14:16.551
This could be the creative
inspiration that you need.

217
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.553
We can do fun stuff
during the day.

218
00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:20.642
and you can write
during your downtime.

219
00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:23.253
It could be exactly
what the doctor ordered.

220
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.776
Mm-hm?

221
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.343
- OK fine.
- Yeah?

222
00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:28.476
Oh. we're going to
the Haven Islands. baby!

223
00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:29.607
Whoo-hoo.

224
00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:46.296
Look at all this.
they've got yoga in the jungle.

225
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.670
cocktails by the pool and...

226
00:14:48.713 --> 00:14:50.672
oh wow. they've got snorkeling
on the reef.

227
00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:52.065
Snorkeling?

228
00:14:52.108 --> 00:14:53.849
In the middle of the open sea?

229
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.938
Katie. do you have any idea
what is out there?

230
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:57.679
- No!
- OK. OK.

231
00:14:57.722 --> 00:15:00.116
I just thought you might be
feeling adventurous.

232
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.683
Oh wow!

233
00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:03.206
I cannot wait to get a massage!

234
00:15:14.565 --> 00:15:16.176
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

235
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:27.100
Fresh air. blue skies and not a
sycophantic ambassador in sight.

236
00:15:27.143 --> 00:15:28.797
Indeed. Your Highness.

237
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.059
It's good to be back.

238
00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:32.496
Any messages from Dr Lee?

239
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.933
Ah. strangely none. sir.

240
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:36.413
Well. we are a few days early.

241
00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:38.478
I'm sure they won't mind
if we pop by and say hello.

242
00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:41.462
Certainly. I'll need a minute
to get the rest of the bags.

243
00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:43.333
I'll see you there.

244
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.181
I'm gonna take the scenic route.

245
00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:46.249
Alone. sir?

246
00:15:47.294 --> 00:15:49.209
Winston. it's the Haven Isles.

247
00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:52.038
I'm sure I can manage
a short walk on my own.

248
00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:54.866
Very well. sir.

249
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.999
And while we're here.
try and enjoy yourself...

250
00:15:57.043 --> 00:15:58.609
a little.

251
00:15:58.653 --> 00:15:59.959
Alright?

252
00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:01.830
Yes sir.

253
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:12.058
Would you look at this room?

254
00:16:13.755 --> 00:16:14.799
Gorgeous!

255
00:16:14.843 --> 00:16:16.671
OK. next up. pool bar!

256
00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:18.238
No. I should get some work done.

257
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:20.022
So. write by the pool!

258
00:16:20.066 --> 00:16:21.154
It's fine. you go ahead.

259
00:16:22.503 --> 00:16:24.331
OK. suit yourself.

260
00:16:24.374 --> 00:16:25.636
Catch you later.

261
00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:38.171
Get outta here swans!

262
00:17:08.201 --> 00:17:09.724
Bit of fresh air
never hurt anyone.

263
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:26.567
Hey. Here.

264
00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:30.353
You've got to be kidding me?

265
00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:31.746
Oh. sorry.

266
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.708
This can't be happening.

267
00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:39.101
This can't be happening.

268
00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.235
- Is everything alright?
- Ah.

269
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.109
What are you doing here?

270
00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:48.304
I was about to ask you
the same question.

271
00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:49.894
Have you lost something

272
00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:51.785
or is it merely a fondness
for local plant life?

273
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:53.942
Oh. this? No. no. I was
actually...

274
00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.337
just exploring the gardens.
you know.

275
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.947
getting off the beaten path.

276
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.514
Indeed.

277
00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:02.342
Gathering inspiration
for you next novel.

278
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:04.605
Ah. Ooh. thank you.

279
00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:07.869
Yes. yes. I was wondering if you
were going to pick up on that.

280
00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:09.890
In my defence. I did think
you looked incredibly familiar

281
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:11.133
the entire time.

282
00:18:11.177 --> 00:18:13.483
OK. my secret identity's
been blown.

283
00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:15.268
but you have an answered
my question.

284
00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:16.965
What are you doing here?

285
00:18:17.008 --> 00:18:19.446
Ah... well. I...

286
00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:20.708
Olivia?

287
00:18:22.623 --> 00:18:24.233
Kyle.

288
00:18:24.277 --> 00:18:26.192
Hey... there.

289
00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:29.325
What brings you
to the Haven Isles?

290
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.285
Well...

291
00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:34.896
you know. you always did make
this place sounds so great...

292
00:18:35.592 --> 00:18:38.987
and I realised I could actually
really use a vacation.

293
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.206
Oh.

294
00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:41.990
It's funny because last time
we spoke

295
00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:43.992
you didn't really seem
in the vacationing mood.

296
00:18:47.648 --> 00:18:49.389
I see you decided to come too?

297
00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:51.217
I did. yes.

298
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.306
- I... I'm here with...
- Babe!

299
00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:55.090
It's so beautiful here!

300
00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:58.180
Oh. Hi.

301
00:18:58.224 --> 00:18:59.877
- I'm Tiffany.
- Tiffany?

302
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:03.490
What a wonderful surprise.
I'm Olivia.

303
00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:05.013
Oh.

304
00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:10.105
I'm Alexander.
it's a pleasure to meet you.

305
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.628
Oh. Enchanté.

306
00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:13.064
Ah... Kyle.

307
00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:14.240
Pleasure.

308
00:19:19.462 --> 00:19:22.335
So. how do you two
know each other?

309
00:19:22.378 --> 00:19:26.208
Well. we met at a marketing
conference in LA

310
00:19:26.252 --> 00:19:27.992
three weeks ago.

311
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:30.647
And I saw him speaking and I was
just blown away by his vision.

312
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:33.607
so I introduced myself. we hit
it off and now we're here.

313
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.391
- Isn't he spontaneous?
- Oh yeah.

314
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:37.915
Well. that's Kyle. you never
know what he's gonna do next.

315
00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:41.919
Yeah.

316
00:19:41.963 --> 00:19:44.008
Well. I better go unpack.

317
00:19:44.052 --> 00:19:45.290
- But... don't be too long.
- Yeah.

318
00:19:45.314 --> 00:19:46.576
OK. bye bye.

319
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.230
- See ya.
- OK.

320
00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:50.319
- Isn't she a treat?
- Listen...

321
00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:51.683
I know this must be
a bit strange.

322
00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:53.235
Strange?

323
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.932
Why would this be strange?
I'm fine.

324
00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:57.108
- Great even.
- OK.

325
00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:00.677
Well. maybe we could go
grab lunch.

326
00:20:02.026 --> 00:20:04.246
Well... lunch... the thing...
I...

327
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.727
Actually I believe we already
had lunch plans.

328
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.512
Didn't we. Olivia?

329
00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:11.514
- We do?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:20:11.558 --> 00:20:13.386
We do.

331
00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:16.606
Yes. I am sorry Kyle... um...

332
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.261
- Alexander.
- Alexander and I have plans.

333
00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:21.002
OK.

334
00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:23.787
- Well. maybe another time.
- Great.

335
00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:26.007
- We're here for a week. so...
- A whole week? How fun!

336
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.487
-Yeah.

337
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.097
- OK.
- Well. it was good to see you.

338
00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.838
Oh. maybe let's do one of these.

339
00:20:30.881 --> 00:20:32.274
- Sure.
- Yeah.

340
00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:33.406
Great. Yeah.

341
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:37.323
- Yeah.
- You take care.

342
00:20:37.366 --> 00:20:39.716
Thank you... for that.

343
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.152
Don't mention it.
So that was...

344
00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:43.242
My ex-boyfriend. Yep.

345
00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:45.220
Yep. I thought they're putting
a thousand miles between us

346
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.029
- would give me some space...
- Hey? I was just coming to...

347
00:20:48.638 --> 00:20:50.031
- Sure.
- Hi.

348
00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:51.380
- Hi.
- I'm Katie.

349
00:20:51.424 --> 00:20:52.729
- OK. We gotta go.
- Hey!

350
00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:54.122
Thank you so much. Thank you.

351
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:55.341
Well. perhaps we'll...

352
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:58.387
bump into each other again.

353
00:20:58.431 --> 00:21:00.302
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

354
00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:01.869
I cannot believe that guy.

355
00:21:01.912 --> 00:21:04.132
So first he steals your vacation

356
00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:06.003
and then he shows up with
his new girlfriend.

357
00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:08.789
My app is taking up all my time.

358
00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:10.312
Liar.

359
00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:11.879
How am I supposed to work now?

360
00:21:11.922 --> 00:21:13.422
The whole point was to get away
from my old life.

361
00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:15.230
not have him greet me
and invite me to lunch.

362
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.536
Mm-hm.

363
00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:18.146
Just give up now.

364
00:21:18.189 --> 00:21:19.843
Relax.

365
00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:21.212
There's still plenty of fun
stuff to do on this island

366
00:21:21.236 --> 00:21:22.411
to get your mojo back.

367
00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:24.674
And. speaking of which.

368
00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:26.459
who was that charming young man
back there?

369
00:21:26.502 --> 00:21:29.505
Some random guy I met
at a bookstore in Midtown.

370
00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:32.378
- Small world.
- Very small.

371
00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:34.293
Some might say it's destiny.

372
00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.860
Reconnecting with a handsome
stranger

373
00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:38.471
on an island in paradise.

374
00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:41.256
- You done?
- Mm.

375
00:21:41.952 --> 00:21:43.171
Hey!

376
00:22:16.247 --> 00:22:17.597
Welcome back. Your Highness.

377
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.163
Hello Anna.
it's nice to see you again.

378
00:22:58.072 --> 00:22:59.682
Sir...

379
00:22:59.726 --> 00:23:01.858
Dr Lee sends his deepest
apologies.

380
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:03.556
I'm afraid he's needed
on the mainland.

381
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:05.427
A family matter.

382
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:06.994
Oh dear. I see...

383
00:23:07.037 --> 00:23:09.388
It seems he'll be detained
for at least a fortnight.

384
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.954
And the fundraiser?
How will they...

385
00:23:10.998 --> 00:23:12.758
They're not certain.
It may have to be cancelled.

386
00:23:12.782 --> 00:23:14.784
Without a host...
No. that won't do.

387
00:23:16.482 --> 00:23:18.092
They depend on those donations.

388
00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:22.705
I can do it.

389
00:23:24.098 --> 00:23:26.100
Sir?
I can host the fundraiser.

390
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:27.623
You. Your Highness?

391
00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:29.035
Oh come on. Winston.
we've attended a thousand

392
00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:30.104
formal functions.

393
00:23:31.366 --> 00:23:33.086
We know what we're doing.
We know the drill.

394
00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:35.283
And we have a week to prepare.

395
00:23:36.763 --> 00:23:38.242
We can do this.

396
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:41.202
You'll be expected to prepare
a speech.

397
00:23:44.988 --> 00:23:46.425
Mm.

398
00:23:48.078 --> 00:23:49.645
I suppose you're right.

399
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.435
But my father helped build
this place.

400
00:23:58.349 --> 00:23:59.699
It was our second home.

401
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:05.356
I have to help.

402
00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:13.843
Oh. all afternoon and not even
two sentences to rub together.

403
00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:16.672
Oh don't be so hard on
yourself. Give it time.

404
00:24:17.543 --> 00:24:18.979
Ooh. molten chocolate cake.

405
00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:20.154
- Hm?
- Yeah. whatever.

406
00:24:21.764 --> 00:24:24.201
That doesn't sound like someone
who's having an adventure!

407
00:24:24.245 --> 00:24:26.528
OK. I'm gonna go grab us some
cocktails. I'll be right back.

408
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:27.727
I will be here.

409
00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:29.754
We must review the guest list.

410
00:24:30.033 --> 00:24:31.228
The more attendees we can
motivate to become

411
00:24:31.252 --> 00:24:32.514
regular donors the better.

412
00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:33.820
Quite true. sir.

413
00:24:33.863 --> 00:24:36.562
And yes. do not remind me...
speech.

414
00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:39.086
Perhaps we'll...

415
00:24:43.351 --> 00:24:45.701
Ah. forgive me. Winston.
just a quick detour.

416
00:24:45.745 --> 00:24:47.660
Certainly. sir.

417
00:24:47.703 --> 00:24:49.270
Oh and one small thing...

418
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:51.533
I'm not a prince. alright?

419
00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:52.969
Sir?
Just follow my lead.

420
00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:58.645
Well. this is certainly far more
pleasant than the bushes.

421
00:24:59.454 --> 00:25:02.283
What can I say. I thought
I'd upgrade for the evening.

422
00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:05.808
Forgive me.
this is my old friend. Winston.

423
00:25:05.852 --> 00:25:07.941
Winnie for short.

424
00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:09.899
Winnie. this is Olivia Perkins.

425
00:25:09.943 --> 00:25:10.987
Charmed.

426
00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:13.555
Oh... charmed also.

427
00:25:15.557 --> 00:25:17.341
Oh. are you two here
on vacation together?

428
00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:19.039
It's more of a business trip.

429
00:25:19.082 --> 00:25:21.215
We're actually here for
the Marine Reserve fundraiser.

430
00:25:21.258 --> 00:25:22.433
Really. what do you do?

431
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.263
I actually work with them...
For them.

432
00:25:26.307 --> 00:25:27.980
Occasionally. you know.
just part-time. consulting.

433
00:25:28.004 --> 00:25:31.704
that sort of thing.
working to protect the oceans.

434
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.291
That explains why you've
turned up

435
00:25:34.315 --> 00:25:35.490
halfway around the world.

436
00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:37.144
It does indeed.

437
00:25:39.407 --> 00:25:41.428
As a matter of fact. since we
keep bumping into one another.

438
00:25:41.452 --> 00:25:44.543
I was wondering if...
provided your free. of course.

439
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:48.416
if tomorrow perhaps you'd like
to sample

440
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:50.461
some of the recreation
activities on offer?

441
00:25:50.505 --> 00:25:52.463
Actually I came here
to get some work done. so...

442
00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:54.683
Well. hello there.

443
00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:56.206
- Katie...
- Yeah.

444
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.991
..this is Alexander
and his friend. Winnie.

445
00:25:58.034 --> 00:25:59.601
- Delighted to meet you.
- Charmed.

446
00:25:59.645 --> 00:26:01.995
Winnie? That's adorable.

447
00:26:02.735 --> 00:26:05.302
So. what are you boys up to
while you're here?

448
00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:07.846
Well. I was actually just asking
Olivia if she was interested...

449
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.133
- Oh. we would love to.
- What do you mean?

450
00:26:10.177 --> 00:26:11.831
- I have to...
- One moment. please.

451
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:15.835
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?

452
00:26:15.878 --> 00:26:17.706
These are charming.
interesting people

453
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.150
that are asking to hang out
with us.

454
00:26:19.534 --> 00:26:20.796
Of course we're gonna say yes!

455
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.624
But the book?
This is for the book.

456
00:26:22.668 --> 00:26:24.713
We are here to have an
adventure.

457
00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:28.325
To do that you actually need
to do some adventuring.

458
00:26:28.369 --> 00:26:29.413
Mm-hm.

459
00:26:30.066 --> 00:26:31.459
Sorry. one more moment. please.

460
00:26:31.502 --> 00:26:32.982
Yeah. thanks.

461
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:34.941
- I can't just run off and...
- Listen.

462
00:26:36.464 --> 00:26:38.118
Can you imagine Kyle's face

463
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:41.512
when he sees you spending time
with a beautiful man

464
00:26:41.556 --> 00:26:42.775
living your best life?

465
00:26:42.818 --> 00:26:43.863
Hm?

466
00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:47.344
- OK. I see your point.
- Great.

467
00:26:47.388 --> 00:26:50.652
OK. it's settled. see you both
on the beach at 10a.m.

468
00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:51.740
- Both?
- Perfect

469
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:53.109
- Great.
- Until tomorrow then.

470
00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:54.090
- Mm-hm.
- Did she say both?

471
00:26:54.134 --> 00:26:55.222
Yes.

472
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.100
Winston. I never knew
you were such a fine actor.

473
00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:05.798
Ah... thank you. sir.

474
00:27:07.277 --> 00:27:08.690
In fact. let's dispense with
the titles

475
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:10.585
for the rest of our time here.
shall we?

476
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.413
Inform the staff will you?

477
00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:13.999
May I remind you again. sir.
that palace subterfuge rarely...

478
00:27:14.023 --> 00:27:15.851
This is hardly the palace is it?

479
00:27:15.895 --> 00:27:18.941
Nevertheless. you are. if I may
be so bold. playing with fire.

480
00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:23.903
I know.

481
00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:28.255
You think I should tell Olivia
who I really am?

482
00:27:30.474 --> 00:27:31.998
And you're right. I will.
I promise.

483
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.869
It's just...

484
00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.544
This is the first time
I've ever met someone

485
00:27:37.568 --> 00:27:38.961
the way normal people do.

486
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:42.922
This is the first time I've ever
known what it feels like

487
00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:44.445
to be normal.

488
00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:49.842
And perhaps this way
she can get to know the real me.

489
00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:55.369
As you wish...

490
00:27:56.849 --> 00:27:58.502
Alexander.

491
00:27:59.765 --> 00:28:01.288
Thank you.

492
00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:06.032
I give you my word.
I will tell her.

493
00:28:07.076 --> 00:28:08.774
Just...

494
00:28:08.817 --> 00:28:10.253
when the time is right.

495
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:39.282
Yes. Ridley?

496
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:40.849
<i>All seems well. Your Majesty.</i>

497
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:42.808
The prince is being
rather social.

498
00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:44.853
but I see no cause for concern.

499
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:47.203
Very well.

500
00:28:47.247 --> 00:28:49.379
Please keep a close eye on him.

501
00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:52.861
Don't worry. I'll make sure
there are no problems.

502
00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:55.429
<i>- Thank you. Ridley.</i>
- Ma'am.

503
00:29:05.178 --> 00:29:07.833
Now. remember. just relax
and have fun.

504
00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:09.486
We're not gonna do anything
crazy.

505
00:29:10.444 --> 00:29:11.837
Morning.

506
00:29:16.842 --> 00:29:18.582
Just roll with it. Yeah?

507
00:29:22.586 --> 00:29:23.892
Help.

508
00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:27.983
May I? M-may I?

509
00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:29.811
Yes.

510
00:29:29.855 --> 00:29:32.248
OK. so the key to the forward
stroke is to use your core.

511
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.076
Rather than using your arms
like a bicycle.

512
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.036
try and twist your torso.
alright? It's a piece of cake.

513
00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:39.081
- Like that?
- Yeah. there you go.

514
00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:40.735
Yeah. like that.

515
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.539
Hey. I think I'm getting it.
Yeah. there you go.

516
00:29:42.563 --> 00:29:43.782
- I'm getting it.
- Yeah.

517
00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:45.087
Whoa!

518
00:29:51.485 --> 00:29:53.095
Oh watch out. watch out.

519
00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:54.314
Are you good?

520
00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:55.619
Yes. Oh. Oh.

521
00:29:56.446 --> 00:29:57.491
Whoa!

522
00:29:59.754 --> 00:30:00.973
I'm sorry. what was that.

523
00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.670
you said it was a piece of cake.
right?

524
00:30:02.713 --> 00:30:04.106
Yeah.

525
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.916
-Where did you get that from?

526
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.439
I am just a talented person
really.

527
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:17.919
- Oh.
- Oh really?

528
00:31:17.963 --> 00:31:19.181
Hey!

529
00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:20.617
Hey guys.

530
00:31:21.662 --> 00:31:23.272
Anyone feel like a game?

531
00:31:23.316 --> 00:31:25.381
Oh. yeah babe. this isn't
really Olivia's kind of thing.

532
00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:27.842
Oh. that's OK.

533
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:32.325
Actually. I'd love to play.
Thank you. Tiffany.

534
00:31:32.368 --> 00:31:33.804
Great.

535
00:31:33.848 --> 00:31:34.893
Great.

536
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.939
- You in?
- Absolutely.

537
00:31:41.812 --> 00:31:42.988
- Here we go!
- Whoo-hoo!

538
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.775
Whoo!

539
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:54.608
Come on!

540
00:31:56.044 --> 00:31:57.500
That was OK.
I think I did better than you!

541
00:31:57.524 --> 00:31:59.482
- Yeah.
- Well come on. get into it.

542
00:32:05.575 --> 00:32:06.750
Olivia!

543
00:32:06.794 --> 00:32:08.448
Come on.
Maybe next time.

544
00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:09.971
Kyle!

545
00:32:13.018 --> 00:32:14.410
There we go.

546
00:32:14.454 --> 00:32:16.108
Ooh.

547
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:17.761
Yes. Yeah-eah.

548
00:32:17.805 --> 00:32:19.024
Kyle!

549
00:32:21.504 --> 00:32:23.376
Yeah Olivia!

550
00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:24.638
Thank you. Thank you.

551
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:26.074
It was on your side!

552
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:39.653
Yes!

553
00:32:39.696 --> 00:32:41.002
Yeah! Whoo!

554
00:32:43.483 --> 00:32:45.050
- Yeah. that's great.
- That's good.

555
00:32:45.093 --> 00:32:46.181
Good game.

556
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.143
Good game.

557
00:32:52.318 --> 00:32:53.972
Yeah. you too.

558
00:32:55.364 --> 00:32:56.670
See you guys around.

559
00:32:59.107 --> 00:33:00.935
Ah...

560
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.415
Babe?

561
00:33:08.508 --> 00:33:10.423
This vacation has been
my best idea yet.

562
00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:12.381
Mm!

563
00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:13.948
I mean. our best idea.

564
00:33:14.557 --> 00:33:16.777
That's what I thought.

565
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.039
How was your lunch. Winston?

566
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:20.128
Quite excellent.
And yours. Your Highness?

567
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.661
- It's an old nickname. Right?
- Yeah.

568
00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:32.923
Really?

569
00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:35.796
Yeah. it's... it's a long story.

570
00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:39.234
I-I feel like I've been
tidying up after him for years.

571
00:33:39.278 --> 00:33:40.844
- Oh.
- Oh.

572
00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:45.197
I'm so sorry.

573
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.807
Hey. I just had a thought.

574
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.071
I'm sure a Winnie will go
snorkeling with me. Right?

575
00:33:50.115 --> 00:33:51.681
Oh...

576
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:55.120
Certainly. I'd be delighted.

577
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:56.382
Great.

578
00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.948
Can we convince you guys
to join us?

579
00:33:57.992 --> 00:33:59.385
- Alright. I'm convinced.
- Really?

580
00:33:59.428 --> 00:34:01.778
No! You know how I feel about
snorkeling.

581
00:34:01.822 --> 00:34:03.911
Well. I tried. Let's go.
Catch you kids later.

582
00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:06.957
- Bye.
- See ya.

583
00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:09.153
Something tells me
I'm not gonna be able

584
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:10.459
to convince you
to visit the reef.

585
00:34:10.483 --> 00:34:12.180
And what possibly gave that
away?

586
00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:21.450
- Well. we should...
- Do you want to go for a walk?

587
00:34:21.494 --> 00:34:23.322
Maybe on the beach?

588
00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:24.888
- Only if you...
- I'd love to.

589
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:38.032
Do we have any idea
who this woman is?

590
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:40.948
No Ma'am. I don't recognise her.

591
00:34:40.991 --> 00:34:44.473
Ridley. I want you to ascertain
her identity.

592
00:34:44.517 --> 00:34:46.258
Be discrete about it.

593
00:34:46.301 --> 00:34:48.869
- Yes. Your Majesty.
<i>- Thank you. Ridley.</i>

594
00:34:48.912 --> 00:34:50.827
No. don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

595
00:34:58.792 --> 00:35:01.186
Well. this must be a big change
of scenery from Torovia.

596
00:35:01.229 --> 00:35:03.275
Oh. a welcome one.
I can assure you.

597
00:35:03.318 --> 00:35:04.928
What it's that bad?

598
00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:08.628
Oh no. no. It's... it's quite
beautiful actually.

599
00:35:08.671 --> 00:35:13.763
It's just. well. my family can
be a touch overbearing.

600
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:15.896
They must be proud of your work
though. right?

601
00:35:15.939 --> 00:35:19.334
Alas. my mother had different
plans for my career.

602
00:35:19.378 --> 00:35:20.422
Oh.

603
00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:22.250
As she often likes to remind me.

604
00:35:22.294 --> 00:35:25.427
Yeah. don't worry. that is not
exclusively a Torovian custom.

605
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:27.603
My mum still likes to remind me
it's not too late

606
00:35:27.647 --> 00:35:29.039
to get into real estate.

607
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:30.780
Ooh.

608
00:35:30.824 --> 00:35:34.044
Ever since I was a little kid. I
always dreamt of being a writer.

609
00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:36.153
After I realised being
a princess

610
00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:37.744
wasn't gonna work out for me.

611
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:42.506
What about your dad. what does
he think about what you do?

612
00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:46.250
He passed away when I was a boy.

613
00:35:46.274 --> 00:35:48.058
- I'm so sorry.
- No it's alright.

614
00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:51.714
I was lucky.

615
00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:53.847
We had some wonderful times
together.

616
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:57.479
He actually helped to establish
the Marine Reserve.

617
00:35:57.503 --> 00:35:59.592
so we visited this island a lot.

618
00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:02.508
He truly believed in giving back
and helping others.

619
00:36:04.597 --> 00:36:06.903
And if I ever start to doubt
myself. I just think of him.

620
00:36:09.341 --> 00:36:11.169
And this place

621
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:15.129
Does that sound corny?

622
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.348
Not at all.

623
00:36:19.394 --> 00:36:20.917
What about you?

624
00:36:20.961 --> 00:36:22.876
Do you have a place
you like to get away too?

625
00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:26.271
Maybe Stella's sandwich shop
on West 34th.

626
00:36:26.314 --> 00:36:27.881
Mm. that must be some sandwich.

627
00:36:27.924 --> 00:36:30.971
I am telling you.
it will change your life.

628
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:33.495
Honestly. I've never really been
much further than Jersey.

629
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.672
Wait. but...

630
00:36:38.848 --> 00:36:40.850
all those amazing globetrotting
adventures?

631
00:36:40.894 --> 00:36:42.243
Made 'em up.

632
00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:44.941
You disappointed.

633
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:47.248
On the contrary...

634
00:36:47.292 --> 00:36:48.617
you're an even better writer
than I thought.

635
00:36:48.641 --> 00:36:49.772
Thank you.

636
00:36:52.297 --> 00:36:53.907
Does explain the kayaking
though.

637
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:56.866
Oh. don't get me wrong.
I always wanted to travel.

638
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.955
See something new. exciting.
different.

639
00:36:58.999 --> 00:37:01.175
Really have an adventure.
you know?

640
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:03.090
And then once the books
took off.

641
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:04.657
it was all about
getting to New York

642
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.702
and meeting with publishers
and yada yada yada.

643
00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:08.443
It just... I...

644
00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:09.966
I've never had the time.

645
00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:13.405
Well. you're here.

646
00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:14.797
I mean. you did it.

647
00:37:14.841 --> 00:37:17.713
Yeah. except I originally
booked this trip

648
00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:20.934
for my anniversary with Kyle
right before he declared

649
00:37:20.977 --> 00:37:22.762
that he didn't have time
for relationship.

650
00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:26.418
- You're kidding?
- Mm-mm.

651
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:28.681
Turns out. plot twist.
he's a giant liar.

652
00:37:30.813 --> 00:37:33.294
- Indeed.
- Yeah. I know how to pick 'em.

653
00:37:35.427 --> 00:37:36.863
That's not even the problem.

654
00:37:38.168 --> 00:37:41.171
The thing is my readers.
they love romance in my stories.

655
00:37:41.215 --> 00:37:43.609
they expect this fairy tale
ending.

656
00:37:44.566 --> 00:37:46.220
Every time I try and sit down
and write.

657
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:49.615
I just... I can't seem to find
the...

658
00:37:49.658 --> 00:37:52.400
- Writers block?
- Yeah. it's pathetic. I know.

659
00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:54.359
But I have this publisher
who's freaking out

660
00:37:54.402 --> 00:37:57.100
on this deadline
and the whole thing is just...

661
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.364
Honestly. it's terrifying.

662
00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:02.062
I don't blame you.

663
00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:04.369
I'd probably be feeling
the same way.

664
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.415
But in all honesty...

665
00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:09.635
and this is coming from one of
your biggest fans...

666
00:38:11.114 --> 00:38:12.507
you don't owe anyone anything.

667
00:38:13.116 --> 00:38:14.944
Take all the time you need.

668
00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:19.775
And when you're ready
for another story...

669
00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:22.343
I'll be waiting.

670
00:38:22.387 --> 00:38:23.866
Um... we'll be waiting.

671
00:38:24.693 --> 00:38:26.434
The... the fans. I mean.

672
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:28.131
- Yes. yes.
- Mm.

673
00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:30.525
Would you mind calling my
publisher and passing that on?

674
00:38:31.483 --> 00:38:32.745
Gladly.

675
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:38.141
Thank you for another lovely
day.

676
00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:40.318
Oh. you are most welcome.

677
00:38:42.798 --> 00:38:43.862
Look. not that I'm trying to
monopolise your time.

678
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:45.845
but would you go to accompany me

679
00:38:45.888 --> 00:38:47.455
to the Marine Reserve
fundraiser?

680
00:38:48.674 --> 00:38:50.502
Otherwise. it would just be
Winston and I.

681
00:38:50.545 --> 00:38:52.895
and I'm really trying to get him
to take some time off.

682
00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:55.463
I mean. I'd have to check
my schedule first.

683
00:38:55.507 --> 00:38:56.943
Oh.

684
00:38:57.509 --> 00:38:58.989
But I think we could make that
happen.

685
00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:03.341
Wonderful.

686
00:39:03.993 --> 00:39:06.692
- Goodnight Alexander.
- Goodnight Olivia.

687
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:57.743
- Come in.
- Hey.

688
00:39:58.613 --> 00:39:59.658
Oh hi.

689
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.705
- Sir.
- Hello old fellow.

690
00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:06.969
How was the reef?

691
00:40:07.013 --> 00:40:09.494
- It was quite spectacular. sir.
- Good.

692
00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:12.514
I trust you and Miss Perkins
had a pleasant time together?

693
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:14.760
What did you two get up to?

694
00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:17.850
Um...
we went for a walk on the beach.

695
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:19.634
And?

696
00:40:19.678 --> 00:40:22.071
To tell you the truth she is...

697
00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:23.333
quite amazing.

698
00:40:23.377 --> 00:40:24.639
It was nice.

699
00:40:26.293 --> 00:40:28.948
What are you doing? What are you
doing... are... are you writing?

700
00:40:30.297 --> 00:40:31.603
Are you back?

701
00:40:31.646 --> 00:40:32.884
I don't know
what you're talking about.

702
00:40:32.908 --> 00:40:34.301
Yes. Yes.

703
00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:37.609
- Will you relax.
- I am too busy been right. baby.

704
00:40:37.652 --> 00:40:39.741
- Doing the dance?
- Ooh. ooh. ooh.

705
00:40:39.785 --> 00:40:41.743
OK. OK. OK.

706
00:40:41.787 --> 00:40:44.137
It may have been more than nice.

707
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.268
OK.

708
00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:47.227
Now can I please
get back to work?

709
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.489
Sure.

710
00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:51.013
Just because I'm gonna be
right over here.

711
00:40:51.057 --> 00:40:52.145
Because I'm <i>right!</i>

712
00:40:52.798 --> 00:40:55.104
She's perceptive.
witty and quite possibly

713
00:40:55.148 --> 00:40:57.193
one of the most interesting
people I've ever met.

714
00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:01.118
Present company excluded.
of course.

715
00:41:01.154 --> 00:41:02.677
Ooh.

716
00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:04.244
You do know how to flatter me.
sir.

717
00:41:05.158 --> 00:41:07.769
However. if I may ask...

718
00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:11.773
precisely which Alexander is she
getting to know?

719
00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:16.082
The marine conservationist
or the prince?

720
00:41:19.564 --> 00:41:20.956
I know.

721
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.930
I'm going to tell her. I'm just
waiting for the right time.

722
00:41:26.919 --> 00:41:29.574
If I once again may be so bold.
sir?

723
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:34.709
Why are you so adverse
to sharing the truth with her?

724
00:41:39.714 --> 00:41:41.890
Because the lie is so much more
pleasant.

725
00:41:45.546 --> 00:41:47.243
Your Highness.

726
00:41:57.645 --> 00:41:59.342
Very well.

727
00:42:08.743 --> 00:42:10.484
Hello?

728
00:42:11.964 --> 00:42:13.313
She didn't order anything.

729
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:14.532
Oh no. miss. this is a gift

730
00:42:14.575 --> 00:42:16.490
from another one of our guests.

731
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:18.100
These guys.

732
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:19.188
Wow!

733
00:42:20.015 --> 00:42:21.582
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

734
00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:23.976
Do we need to sign or...?

735
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:25.717
Oh no. all taken care of. miss.

736
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.196
May I just confirm your name?

737
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.198
- Perkins.
- And your first name?

738
00:42:30.678 --> 00:42:31.853
Olivia.

739
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.117
Thank you both so very much.

740
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:36.379
No. thank you.

741
00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:40.601
Wow.

742
00:42:43.343 --> 00:42:45.867
Your Majesty. I have a name.

743
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.218
Olivia Perkins.

744
00:42:49.262 --> 00:42:50.785
American.

745
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:53.527
Writer. Popular fiction.

746
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:56.269
Father a refrigerator mechanic.

747
00:42:56.312 --> 00:42:59.141
mother housewife
and part-time accountant.

748
00:42:59.707 --> 00:43:01.883
Not exactly high society
are there?

749
00:43:01.927 --> 00:43:03.493
<i>No Ma'am. not exactly.</i>

750
00:43:03.537 --> 00:43:06.061
Never married.
Boyfriend six years separated.

751
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:09.674
Ridley...

752
00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:11.676
we need to do something
about this.

753
00:43:12.328 --> 00:43:13.373
Yes Ma'am.

754
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:33.654
Olivia.

755
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:35.308
Hi.

756
00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:37.615
I was just getting some work
done.

757
00:43:37.658 --> 00:43:39.331
Olivia. there's something I need
to tell you.

758
00:43:39.355 --> 00:43:40.400
Yeah. what is it?

759
00:43:46.014 --> 00:43:49.061
I've had such a wonderful time
these past few days.

760
00:43:51.367 --> 00:43:53.326
But...

761
00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:58.897
I'm afraid I haven't been
entirely... forthright.

762
00:44:00.463 --> 00:44:01.726
OK.

763
00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:03.466
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm...

764
00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:08.907
- I'm a...
- Sir?

765
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.082
Sir...

766
00:44:10.125 --> 00:44:12.301
Ah... Alexander.

767
00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:15.914
Winnie. this isn't really
a good time.

768
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:17.045
I have a message from home.

769
00:44:18.438 --> 00:44:19.850
- I'm sure it can wait.
- Sir. I strongly suggest...

770
00:44:19.874 --> 00:44:21.528
I'm afraid it cannot wait. sir.

771
00:44:24.009 --> 00:44:25.929
Your mother wishes
to speak with you immediately.

772
00:44:26.359 --> 00:44:27.534
Ridley.

773
00:44:27.577 --> 00:44:30.537
OK. what is going on?

774
00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:34.584
Olivia. I can explain.

775
00:44:35.585 --> 00:44:37.413
Your Highness?

776
00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.198
Your High...

777
00:44:40.242 --> 00:44:41.853
Queen is waiting. sir?

778
00:44:41.896 --> 00:44:42.984
The Queen?

779
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:50.688
Olivia. you see. I'm sort of...

780
00:44:52.211 --> 00:44:54.953
well... a prince.

781
00:44:56.476 --> 00:44:57.695
- What?
- Let me explain.

782
00:44:57.738 --> 00:44:58.957
A prince?

783
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.133
- Your mother is...
- Thank you. Ridley.

784
00:45:05.528 --> 00:45:07.574
Olivia. I was going to tell you.

785
00:45:09.054 --> 00:45:10.359
You were lying to me.

786
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:13.623
I swear. I...

787
00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:15.190
Olivia please.

788
00:45:19.499 --> 00:45:22.197
- How long have you been here?
- The Queen is waiting. sir.

789
00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:26.985
Mother. how long has Ridley
been spying on me?

790
00:45:27.028 --> 00:45:29.596
He's been doing precisely
as I asked.

791
00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:31.337
Keeping an eye on you

792
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.184
and keeping me informed
of the mess you've been making.

793
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:34.470
Mess?!

794
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.690
What are you talking about?

795
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.518
Oh. come now. Alexander.

796
00:45:38.561 --> 00:45:40.215
gallivanting around
with a commoner

797
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.391
like a schoolboy on holiday.
it's beneath you.

798
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:45.133
Mother. I haven't been...

799
00:45:45.177 --> 00:45:47.527
You've left me no choice
but to intervene.

800
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.052
Now. for your sake and for
the sake of the family's image.

801
00:45:51.096 --> 00:45:53.751
<i>stop wasting your time
with this girl.</i>

802
00:45:53.794 --> 00:45:55.622
<i>The instant this fundraiser
is over.</i>

803
00:45:55.665 --> 00:45:57.319
<i>I expect you on the first flight
home</i>

804
00:45:57.363 --> 00:45:58.886
That is final.

805
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.416
Get out of here.

806
00:46:09.505 --> 00:46:12.813
Sir. if I may.
Her Majesty's only doing what...

807
00:46:12.857 --> 00:46:14.946
Did you not hear me. Ridley?

808
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:28.829
- A prince?
- Mm-hm.

809
00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:31.310
A prince of what?

810
00:46:34.835 --> 00:46:38.230
Prince Alexander the Third
of Torovia.

811
00:46:38.273 --> 00:46:40.449
Wow. He's an actual prince!

812
00:46:40.493 --> 00:46:43.191
He's an actual prince
who invented a fake identity

813
00:46:43.235 --> 00:46:46.064
and has been lying to my face
for the past three days.

814
00:46:46.107 --> 00:46:47.326
Yeah.

815
00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:48.893
To be fair.
when you guys first met.

816
00:46:48.936 --> 00:46:50.982
you kind of didn't tell him
who you were either.

817
00:46:52.722 --> 00:46:54.855
OK. OK. Look...

818
00:46:54.899 --> 00:46:56.944
I am sure that there's a perfect
explanation.

819
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.555
Maybe he wanted to keep
a low profile.

820
00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:01.209
You know.
kick it with the normies.

821
00:47:03.995 --> 00:47:06.649
Or maybe he didn't want to
freak you out..

822
00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:08.608
The main thing is...

823
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:10.523
he is a prince!

824
00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:13.352
And he's into you.

825
00:47:13.395 --> 00:47:15.310
You're having an adventure.

826
00:47:15.354 --> 00:47:16.746
What is the problem?

827
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.836
- He...
- You like him?

828
00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:21.273
Just talk to him about it.

829
00:47:22.927 --> 00:47:24.667
Wait a minute...

830
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:28.715
so if Alex is a prince.
what does that make Winston?

831
00:47:28.758 --> 00:47:30.717
I don't know. his bodyguard?

832
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.762
His bodyguard.

833
00:47:32.806 --> 00:47:34.242
Wow.

834
00:47:34.286 --> 00:47:36.288
That is so hot.

835
00:47:41.728 --> 00:47:43.338
- Huh.
- Oh.

836
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.779
Well hello. Your Highness.

837
00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:50.868
Hey Alex.

838
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.959
I'm sorry.

839
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.352
I know. I know I should have...

840
00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:59.354
Feeding me those lines about
saving the ocean.

841
00:47:59.398 --> 00:48:01.095
that was a smooth touch.

842
00:48:01.139 --> 00:48:02.662
Well. most of that was true.

843
00:48:05.752 --> 00:48:07.686
But that doesn't change the fact
that I should have told you

844
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.712
the whole truth
from the beginning.

845
00:48:09.756 --> 00:48:12.019
Winston virtually screamed it
at me.

846
00:48:12.063 --> 00:48:13.542
Oh.

847
00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:20.636
Olivia. I did what I did
because...

848
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.945
I wanted a chance to show
someone who I really am...

849
00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:26.642
underneath.

850
00:48:27.774 --> 00:48:29.558
And doing so allowed me
to get to know you.

851
00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:34.128
Selfish though that may have
been...

852
00:48:35.738 --> 00:48:37.610
I believe it was worth it.

853
00:48:39.873 --> 00:48:42.310
Please allow me
to make it up to you.

854
00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:47.011
No more secrets. I promise.

855
00:48:50.753 --> 00:48:53.843
And perhaps a reintroduction
is in order.

856
00:49:01.808 --> 00:49:04.593
Prince Alexander Barkley
the Third of Torovia.

857
00:49:10.251 --> 00:49:11.949
Honoured to make
your acquaintance.

858
00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:15.169
Alright. Your Highness...

859
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.606
I'm starving.

860
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.957
You can start making it up to me
by buying me lunch.

861
00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:21.784
I'd be delighted.

862
00:49:21.828 --> 00:49:23.482
Shall we?

863
00:49:27.181 --> 00:49:28.356
Love.

864
00:49:32.795 --> 00:49:34.493
Yes. Your Majesty?

865
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:37.539
Yes. I'm... I'm departing now.

866
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:41.152
Ridley. this business between
Alexander and the American...

867
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.155
is it just a fling or...

868
00:49:44.198 --> 00:49:45.983
do you believe it's something
more serious?

869
00:49:47.462 --> 00:49:49.073
Who can be certain. Ma'am.

870
00:49:49.116 --> 00:49:50.900
All I can say. with confidence.

871
00:49:50.944 --> 00:49:53.053
is I don't believe I've ever
seen the prince this invested

872
00:49:53.077 --> 00:49:54.817
or...

873
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:56.471
this happy.

874
00:49:58.473 --> 00:50:00.388
That's what concerns me.

875
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:03.609
Your Majesty. if I may?

876
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:08.396
Yes.

877
00:50:09.354 --> 00:50:10.964
Perhaps...

878
00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:15.055
Ridley?

879
00:50:16.448 --> 00:50:17.710
Nothing Ma'am.

880
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:19.494
Forgive me.

881
00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:32.551
Blast.

882
00:50:41.734 --> 00:50:44.693
So do you have a crown
and a throne and all that stuff?

883
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.785
There are some family jewels
and there is a chair.

884
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:51.744
But they're only formalities.

885
00:50:51.787 --> 00:50:53.050
And quite uncomfortable.

886
00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:55.095
OK.

887
00:50:55.139 --> 00:50:56.531
Do you live in a palace?

888
00:50:58.707 --> 00:51:00.144
Indeed.

889
00:51:00.187 --> 00:51:03.016
But it's frightfully draughty
in the winter

890
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.366
and mercilessly hot
in the summer.

891
00:51:07.325 --> 00:51:09.022
OK. I've got a big question.

892
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:11.372
who is the most important
or memorable person

893
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:13.070
you have ever met?

894
00:51:13.113 --> 00:51:14.332
You mean beside yourself?

895
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:17.465
Oh. well played! Very suave.

896
00:51:17.509 --> 00:51:19.815
Thank you. Years of practice.

897
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.046
Welcome to the Haven
Marine Reserve.

898
00:51:38.747 --> 00:51:41.228
The whole operation is supported
strictly by public donations

899
00:51:41.272 --> 00:51:43.274
and fundraisers. so...

900
00:51:43.317 --> 00:51:45.667
I try to support however I can.

901
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:48.757
I would imagine having a prince
on their team isn't half bad.

902
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:51.214
Well. you might think
differently when you realise

903
00:51:51.238 --> 00:51:53.545
how quickly I put everyone
to sleep with my sp...

904
00:51:55.024 --> 00:51:56.809
- Oh. blast.
- What?

905
00:51:58.637 --> 00:52:00.552
I forgot I need to prepare
a speech.

906
00:52:00.595 --> 00:52:02.336
Hey. it's no big deal.

907
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.576
It's just finding the right
words to capture

908
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.733
precisely what I want to say
has never exactly been

909
00:52:07.776 --> 00:52:08.995
my strongest suit.

910
00:52:09.038 --> 00:52:10.431
Is that so?

911
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:13.956
Oh. wow.

912
00:52:17.264 --> 00:52:18.439
Beautiful.

913
00:52:20.093 --> 00:52:22.791
There are over 5.000 species
that call the Haven Reef home..

914
00:52:24.097 --> 00:52:26.360
- Did you just say 5000?
- And counting.

915
00:52:28.188 --> 00:52:29.992
That's why it's imperative
that we do everything we can

916
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.235
to protect them.

917
00:52:35.587 --> 00:52:37.217
Of course. in my opinion.
there's only one way

918
00:52:37.241 --> 00:52:40.069
to truly experience the beauty
the reef has to offer.

919
00:53:10.796 --> 00:53:12.363
I'm not so sure about this.

920
00:53:12.406 --> 00:53:13.929
There's nothing to fear.

921
00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:17.518
Um... just don't be alarmed
by the sharks.

922
00:53:17.542 --> 00:53:19.108
Sharks!

923
00:53:19.152 --> 00:53:21.032
They're only babies.
They won't do you any harm.

924
00:53:32.252 --> 00:53:33.253
You ready?

925
00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:38.954
Don't worry. it'll be worth it.

926
00:53:38.998 --> 00:53:40.347
I promise.

927
00:53:40.391 --> 00:53:42.480
Three. two. one.

928
00:53:42.523 --> 00:53:44.133
Go!

929
00:54:49.068 --> 00:54:50.635
So... worth it?

930
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:53.638
Totally!

931
00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:55.379
- Yes!
- OK. you were right.

932
00:54:57.598 --> 00:54:59.948
I suppose all we have to do
is take that first step.

933
00:55:02.168 --> 00:55:03.517
So about that speech...

934
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.998
Yes. of course. thank you
for reminding me.

935
00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:08.000
Well. actually I was thinking
you're lucky

936
00:55:08.043 --> 00:55:11.264
you have a writer available
who can help.

937
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:13.788
You'd do that for me?

938
00:55:14.876 --> 00:55:17.531
Well. I'm doing it
for the Marine Reserve.

939
00:55:24.669 --> 00:55:27.236
OK. where do you want to start?

940
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.282
The Reserve. The mission.

941
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:31.371
Um...

942
00:55:34.418 --> 00:55:37.421
Hello. Hm... what are you doing?

943
00:55:37.464 --> 00:55:38.813
Hm?

944
00:55:42.513 --> 00:55:44.341
That's the one.

945
00:55:45.559 --> 00:55:47.996
- I have to take the babe.
- Again?

946
00:55:49.694 --> 00:55:51.565
Hey yeah. what's up?

947
00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:08.713
Yeah. yeah sorry.

948
00:56:08.756 --> 00:56:10.845
OK. yeah. Keep me posted.

949
00:56:11.846 --> 00:56:13.544
Babe. are you done yet?

950
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:19.177
Good evening everyone
and thank you for coming.

951
00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:21.290
I will be your host tonight
so please bear with me.

952
00:56:46.446 --> 00:56:48.709
- Where are we going?
- It's not much further.

953
00:56:49.884 --> 00:56:51.582
Are you sure we're not lost?

954
00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:54.323
I don't think so.

955
00:56:58.066 --> 00:56:59.720
If we get lost in this jungle.

956
00:56:59.764 --> 00:57:01.896
it's not gonna matter that
you're...

957
00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.681
OK. Whoa.

958
00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:07.772
- Charming. isn't it?
- Yeah.

959
00:57:07.815 --> 00:57:10.383
Every chance we got my father
and I would explore this island.

960
00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:11.645
I can see why.

961
00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:13.255
Hey. wait for me!

962
00:57:18.522 --> 00:57:20.611
Wow. it's beautiful.

963
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:25.529
Hey are you OK?

964
00:57:27.922 --> 00:57:29.446
Yeah. I suppose it's just...

965
00:57:31.186 --> 00:57:33.450
this island is where I felt
closest to him.

966
00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:36.061
You know where I could
talk to him.

967
00:57:36.975 --> 00:57:39.630
Just a boy and his father.
No Royal protocols.

968
00:57:42.197 --> 00:57:44.983
I just wish I could visit here
more and do more

969
00:57:45.026 --> 00:57:46.985
for the Marine Reserve.

970
00:57:47.028 --> 00:57:49.030
Even do more to help
other places around the world

971
00:57:49.074 --> 00:57:52.207
where conservation
is sorely needed.

972
00:57:53.687 --> 00:57:55.123
Why can't you?

973
00:57:56.995 --> 00:57:58.562
Sadly. when the crown
passes to me.

974
00:57:58.605 --> 00:57:59.954
I won't get much of a chance.

975
00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:02.803
You'll be the king.
you'll be calling all the shots.

976
00:58:02.827 --> 00:58:05.525
"There'll be little time
for personal fancies."

977
00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:08.093
My mother's words.

978
00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:09.921
Doesn't she know how important
this is?

979
00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:11.488
How much this means to you?

980
00:58:13.185 --> 00:58:15.206
Tradition is everything to her
and once she's made up her mind

981
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:16.470
it's very difficult to sway it.

982
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.713
I get that.

983
00:58:21.933 --> 00:58:23.500
But things change...

984
00:58:24.762 --> 00:58:27.591
Alexander. and sometimes people
need to change. too.

985
00:58:30.202 --> 00:58:32.049
I spent most of my life
being told I should give up

986
00:58:32.073 --> 00:58:33.379
on what I love.

987
00:58:34.336 --> 00:58:36.208
And I don't know much about
Royal protocols...

988
00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:39.646
but I know you have to be honest
with yourself.

989
00:58:41.039 --> 00:58:43.650
And you can't be afraid
to follow your dreams.

990
00:58:44.956 --> 00:58:46.610
Regardless of what anyone says.

991
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.792
Now that was almost convincing.

992
00:58:54.835 --> 00:58:57.621
Well. I suppose sometimes

993
00:58:57.664 --> 00:58:59.536
you just have to take
that first step.

994
00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:02.626
Oh right.

995
00:59:02.669 --> 00:59:04.323
Yes. that's good advice.

996
00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:05.846
Thank you. Thought so too.

997
00:59:09.502 --> 00:59:12.505
So. how are we feeling about
that speech?

998
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:15.595
Ah yeah.
as ready as I'll ever be.

999
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:17.292
Thanks to you.

1000
00:59:17.336 --> 00:59:18.879
You said this would
just be the two of us

1001
00:59:18.903 --> 00:59:20.358
but you've barely spoken to me
since we got here!

1002
00:59:20.382 --> 00:59:21.993
We're talking right now.
aren't we?

1003
00:59:22.036 --> 00:59:23.777
You've been in meetings
the entire week!

1004
00:59:23.821 --> 00:59:28.042
- Come on. you're overreacting.
- Don't tell me I'm overreacting.

1005
00:59:28.086 --> 00:59:30.262
I'm not here to be
your arm candy!

1006
00:59:31.002 --> 00:59:32.960
I may as well have come
by myself!

1007
00:59:33.004 --> 00:59:34.440
- Tiff...
- Get off!

1008
00:59:35.441 --> 00:59:36.964
Enjoy your meetings.

1009
00:59:41.534 --> 00:59:43.188
Oh. sorry about that.

1010
00:59:44.145 --> 00:59:46.495
She's been feeling
a little stressed.

1011
00:59:52.414 --> 00:59:54.373
It's the reserve.
I should probably take this.

1012
00:59:54.416 --> 00:59:56.767
- But I'll see you tonight?
- Yeah. See you then.

1013
00:59:57.419 --> 00:59:58.638
Excuse me.

1014
01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:04.949
So. you two certainly seem to be
spending a lot of time together?

1015
01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:07.386
Yeah. it's nice to meet
new people.

1016
01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:09.040
You know. experience new things.

1017
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.258
Yeah.

1018
01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:12.957
Sometimes.

1019
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:17.483
Just talk to her.

1020
01:00:17.526 --> 01:00:18.789
Maybe try listening.

1021
01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:22.793
Hey and if that fails.
grovelling is always an option.

1022
01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:26.163
- That was almost supportive.
- Don't get used to it.

1023
01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:27.885
OK. OK.

1024
01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:30.627
Thanks. Olivia.

1025
01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:33.804
You know. that Alexander
is a lucky guy.

1026
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.422
- Heya.
- Oh hi!

1027
01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:44.989
So. big night tonight. hey?

1028
01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:49.341
You're not gonna wear that
are you?

1029
01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:50.734
What? Why? What's wrong with it?

1030
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.000
You're going on a date with
a prince!

1031
01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:57.262
And luckily you have me here
to help you.

1032
01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:02.441
OK.

1033
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.532
You hauled all of that
to an island?

1034
01:01:06.575 --> 01:01:08.621
Hey! It's my job.

1035
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.797
I have to be prepared
for anything.

1036
01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:12.843
You have a problem.
you know that. right?

1037
01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:14.322
We are gonna find you something

1038
01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:16.281
that's gonna make Alexander
go gaga over you.

1039
01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:18.892
Yeah. Our first contender.

1040
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.373
Here.

1041
01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:22.461
Oh.

1042
01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:33.211
No.

1043
01:01:36.475 --> 01:01:38.085
I actually think I might like
this one.

1044
01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:39.347
No.

1045
01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:42.873
Nope.

1046
01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.875
No. No. No.

1047
01:01:44.918 --> 01:01:46.137
Mm-mm.

1048
01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.225
Out!

1049
01:01:47.268 --> 01:01:48.574
So-so.

1050
01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:49.662
No.

1051
01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:52.709
Oh.

1052
01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.145
Actually. no.

1053
01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:56.669
Are you coming out?

1054
01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:59.106
Well?

1055
01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:02.022
- OK. I'll take that as a no.
- It's a no.

1056
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.546
Alright. time to widen
the search.

1057
01:02:13.991 --> 01:02:16.210
- No.
- What is wrong with this one?

1058
01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:17.864
You look like you're going to
the chapel

1059
01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:19.561
and gonna get married.

1060
01:02:19.605 --> 01:02:21.215
No.

1061
01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:25.698
Well?

1062
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.918
What do you think?

1063
01:02:31.486 --> 01:02:34.794
Like I said... absolutely gaga.

1064
01:02:50.114 --> 01:02:51.942
I think you got it. old sport.

1065
01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:53.825
There's always time for one last
touch up. sir.

1066
01:02:55.684 --> 01:02:57.599
There... picture perfect.

1067
01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:01.255
Now are you certain
you don't need...

1068
01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:02.474
Winston relax.

1069
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.432
I'll be just fine.

1070
01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:06.434
Enjoy your evening with Katie.

1071
01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:13.050
I'm sure everything will go
swimmingly tonight. sir.

1072
01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:15.922
Yes. Yes. I'm sure you're right.

1073
01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:20.579
May I ask if you've had any
thoughts about...

1074
01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:22.059
Going to explain to Olivia

1075
01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:23.688
that I have to return home to
Torovia tomorrow?

1076
01:03:23.712 --> 01:03:25.018
Yes.

1077
01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:27.020
Yes. Yes. I've given it
some thought.

1078
01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:30.807
I think I should...

1079
01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:44.385
Gaga.

1080
01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:50.609
You look...

1081
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.959
amazing.

1082
01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:55.396
What this?
Found it in my luggage.

1083
01:03:58.008 --> 01:03:59.792
You don't look half bad
yourself.

1084
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.141
Very princely.

1085
01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:02.664
Well. you can thank Winston
for that.

1086
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.623
Never fails to have this old
thing on standby.

1087
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.017
Well. I do take my duties
very seriously. sir.

1088
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.584
Now then...

1089
01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:10.672
shall we?

1090
01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:12.544
We shall.

1091
01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:13.980
Catch you two later.

1092
01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:18.680
Shall we?

1093
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.483
So... how is it so far?

1094
01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:39.571
Piece of cake.

1095
01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:44.881
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

1096
01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:05.902
Good evening. everyone
and thank you for coming.

1097
01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:09.949
I will be your host tonight.
so please bear with me.

1098
01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:16.695
Here at the Haven Marine Reserve

1099
01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:20.003
the mission is to protect
and conserve this unique

1100
01:05:20.046 --> 01:05:22.179
and wonderful ecosystem.

1101
01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:24.398
and to inspire others to do
the same.

1102
01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:28.402
This is only possible
thanks to your generous support.

1103
01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:32.319
So from the bottom of our
hearts. thank you.

1104
01:05:35.888 --> 01:05:37.735
It's been one of the biggest
privileges of my life

1105
01:05:37.759 --> 01:05:39.283
to support this organisation.

1106
01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:42.895
Ever since I was a boy.
the Haven Isles have always been

1107
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.201
like a second home to me.

1108
01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:48.988
Working alongside this
incredible team of people

1109
01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:51.469
was one of my father's greatest
passions.

1110
01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:55.952
And he always dreamed
he could do more.

1111
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:02.001
As do I.

1112
01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:16.711
Recently. someone reminded me
that we mustn't be afraid

1113
01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:18.235
to pursue our dreams.

1114
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.851
So I'd like to announce
my intention

1115
01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:28.636
to establish a foundation
in my father's name

1116
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.204
to support not only this
facility

1117
01:06:31.248 --> 01:06:34.729
but to bolster nature
conservation all over the world.

1118
01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:37.819
We must all work together

1119
01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:40.474
to ensure that this
incredible planet

1120
01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:42.868
is protected
for future generations.

1121
01:06:44.478 --> 01:06:47.612
Thank you all so much
and enjoy your evening.

1122
01:06:47.655 --> 01:06:48.700
Whoo!

1123
01:06:54.488 --> 01:06:56.099
Nice speech.

1124
01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:57.970
Well. I can't take
all the credit.

1125
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.016
I had help.

1126
01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:03.410
Would you care to dance?

1127
01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.501
I would love to.

1128
01:07:19.731 --> 01:07:21.167
You've done this before.

1129
01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.625
You think because I can't kayak
I wouldn't know how to dance?

1130
01:07:24.649 --> 01:07:26.346
Touché.

1131
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:28.261
So...

1132
01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:29.871
is there any chance of a sneak
preview

1133
01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:31.414
of what you've been working on
the past few days?

1134
01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:33.832
I think my publishers
might object.

1135
01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:36.289
I mean. what if you leak
spoilers on social media?

1136
01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:38.594
Oh. come on. they won't let me
have passwords to anything.

1137
01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:41.405
I think your secret's safe
with me.

1138
01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.581
OK.

1139
01:07:44.277 --> 01:07:46.453
It is set on a tropical island.

1140
01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:48.238
and it features an everyday
woman

1141
01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:50.327
falling for a prince
in disguise.

1142
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.939
You're far from everyday.

1143
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:03.862
Alexander.
I wanted to thank you.

1144
01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:06.560
- For what?
- For everything.

1145
01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:10.651
For showing me this place.

1146
01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:12.827
For helping me see things
more clearly.

1147
01:08:18.746 --> 01:08:20.270
A girl could really get
used to this.

1148
01:08:27.755 --> 01:08:28.887
Alexander.

1149
01:08:32.238 --> 01:08:33.805
Mother.

1150
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.634
What are you...

1151
01:08:36.677 --> 01:08:39.115
Darling. you know I would do
anything not to miss this.

1152
01:08:40.681 --> 01:08:42.292
I...

1153
01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:46.122
Forgive me. mother.
this is Olivia Perkins.

1154
01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:50.865
Olivia this is my mother.
Queen Patricia Barclay.

1155
01:08:50.909 --> 01:08:52.258
Your Majesty.

1156
01:08:53.172 --> 01:08:54.695
I have heard a lot about you.

1157
01:08:54.739 --> 01:08:56.262
Charmed I'm sure.

1158
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.569
Shall we sit?

1159
01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:02.201
Don't worry.
everything's gonna be fine.

1160
01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:03.465
Who are you trying to convince?

1161
01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:06.316
Ma'am.

1162
01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.439
- I'll be back in a few moments.
- Thank you. Ridley.

1163
01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:11.669
- What is going on there?
- What?

1164
01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:13.512
Between your mother
and the undercover butler.

1165
01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:15.847
- You think...
- Yeah. I do.

1166
01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:27.119
So... I'm told we made some
rather sweeping statements

1167
01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:28.468
just before I arrived?

1168
01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:30.905
I was just speaking
of my intensions...

1169
01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:33.778
Darling. it's always wise
not to make such build promises.

1170
01:09:33.821 --> 01:09:36.261
We can discuss how we're going
to manage this on the way home.

1171
01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:39.523
I understand that you're
a writer. Miss Perkins?

1172
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.742
Yes. Your Majesty.

1173
01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:44.049
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with any of your work.

1174
01:09:44.092 --> 01:09:48.009
but I am told that you target
a less discerning audience.

1175
01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:49.881
so perhaps that's to be
understood.

1176
01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.754
After your little sojourn
with Alexander.

1177
01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:56.757
I certainly hope there won't be
any exaggerated

1178
01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:59.195
Royal caricatures in your next
effort.

1179
01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:01.782
I wasn't aware. Mother.
that you had such an interest

1180
01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:03.242
in Olivia's work?

1181
01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.549
No Ma'am. No caricatures... yet.

1182
01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:11.250
Please excuse me. Your Majesty.
Your Highness.

1183
01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:13.774
I've been asked to check
if the Prince is available

1184
01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:16.560
to join some of the other
donors for some photographs.

1185
01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:17.648
Not at the moment...

1186
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:18.953
Oh Alexander. do go.

1187
01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:20.279
this is precisely the sort
of thing

1188
01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:21.652
you're always going on about.

1189
01:10:21.695 --> 01:10:24.176
A chance for more exposure
of this place.

1190
01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.091
And it'll give Olivia and I
a chance

1191
01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:27.658
to get to know one another.

1192
01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:31.792
Go. Do your thing.

1193
01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:37.320
Very well. just a few photos.

1194
01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:38.582
I'll be right back.

1195
01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:44.675
This way. sir.

1196
01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:47.721
Ma'am.

1197
01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:05.043
Olivia. I think we should use
this opportunity

1198
01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:06.653
to talk frankly.

1199
01:11:06.697 --> 01:11:08.612
- OK.
- Good.

1200
01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:09.830
I'll go first.

1201
01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:12.398
You're in love with my son.

1202
01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.620
- I'm...
- Oh heavens.

1203
01:11:16.663 --> 01:11:18.752
If I'm mistaken it would be
a wonderful relief.

1204
01:11:18.796 --> 01:11:21.538
so please do tell me if
I've misread the situation.

1205
01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:28.849
No. I thought not.

1206
01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:31.983
How concerning.

1207
01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:33.637
And what's even more concerning

1208
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.815
is that my son appears
to reciprocate your feelings.

1209
01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:39.295
That presents a problem.

1210
01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.732
And do you understand why?

1211
01:11:41.775 --> 01:11:43.734
No. but I think you're about
to tell me.

1212
01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:47.999
Because you are out
of your element.

1213
01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:55.963
Olivia. the life of a king
is a life of commitment.

1214
01:11:56.007 --> 01:11:57.530
of consequence.

1215
01:11:57.574 --> 01:12:01.360
Alexander is far more
than a diplomat.

1216
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:04.232
he's... he's a symbol.

1217
01:12:04.276 --> 01:12:06.887
The people expect much from him
and from his queen.

1218
01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:13.329
My son needs someone by his side
who understands his world.

1219
01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.940
someone who can support him.
who can protect him.

1220
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:20.466
And I'm afraid that is not you.

1221
01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:23.948
Does Alexander get a say
in this?

1222
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:28.866
Olivia. I treasure my son
more than you could know.

1223
01:12:28.909 --> 01:12:31.825
but he lives with his head
in the clouds.

1224
01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:34.350
Oh. perhaps he believes
you can be happy together.

1225
01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:36.090
somehow.

1226
01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:37.720
But. my dear.
I'm afraid that's simply not

1227
01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:39.093
the way the world works.

1228
01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:43.271
Very well.

1229
01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:45.796
Let's play out the scenario.
shall we?

1230
01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:50.104
Even if you were to transplant
your entire life to Torovia.

1231
01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:54.065
as king. Alexander's duties
and travel would be immense.

1232
01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:55.925
You'd barely see each other.

1233
01:12:57.068 --> 01:12:59.853
So there you are.
alone in a foreign land

1234
01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:03.857
with a lack of privacy that you
could not possibly imagine.

1235
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.643
Every aspect of your day
meticulously planned.

1236
01:13:06.686 --> 01:13:08.514
Every moment scheduled.

1237
01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:10.821
Every movement tracked.

1238
01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:13.998
The public. the press.
all vying for a piece of you.

1239
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:17.436
And soon. with Alexander's
mounting guilt

1240
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.570
about your unhappiness.
he becomes distracted.

1241
01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:22.876
He makes mistakes.

1242
01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:25.923
That cannot happen.

1243
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:31.711
Olivia. this is not your world.

1244
01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:35.367
You don't belong here
and you never will.

1245
01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:39.240
So if you do care for my son.

1246
01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:43.636
if you truly want
what's best for him.

1247
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.161
then. please. before any more
damage is done...

1248
01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:49.250
leave him be.

1249
01:13:56.997 --> 01:14:01.480
We both know what he would say
if you asked.

1250
01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:03.134
but it wouldn't make
any difference.

1251
01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:08.444
Trust me.
it's easiest just to walk away.

1252
01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.764
Olivia...

1253
01:14:24.808 --> 01:14:26.940
all the best with your new book.

1254
01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:51.617
Where is Olivia?

1255
01:14:51.661 --> 01:14:53.619
Poor dear developed
a terrible headache

1256
01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:55.142
and decided to go back
to her room.

1257
01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:56.840
Oh. I should go check on her.

1258
01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:59.035
Nonsense. she knows how much
this evening means to you.

1259
01:14:59.059 --> 01:15:02.236
She insisted that you stay here
and enjoy the rest of the night.

1260
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.065
Come now. let's go and have some
photographs taken together.

1261
01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:15.336
Olivia. hey. Whoa.
Is everything OK?

1262
01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:18.794
I bet that stuck up snob
said something. didn't he?

1263
01:15:18.818 --> 01:15:20.341
No.

1264
01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:22.256
I had a bad feeling about him
from the start.

1265
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.216
Don't worry.
you're too good for him anyway.

1266
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:28.088
Where's Tiffany?

1267
01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:30.569
Oh she...

1268
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:35.574
decided that it would be better
that I...

1269
01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:36.749
focus on my career for now.

1270
01:15:38.185 --> 01:15:40.405
Hey. you know. I'm actually
really glad you're here.

1271
01:15:40.448 --> 01:15:42.128
There's something
I've been wanting to say.

1272
01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:45.628
I'm just gonna come out with it.

1273
01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:47.281
I think we made
a terrible mistake.

1274
01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:51.372
I know. it sounds crazy.
but having some time apart

1275
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:55.899
and then seeing you again here.
suddenly everything is so clear.

1276
01:15:56.508 --> 01:16:00.077
I thought we were on different
paths. but...

1277
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.644
but I was wrong.

1278
01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:05.256
I just want things to be back
like they used to be.

1279
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.478
Let's get out of here.

1280
01:16:10.522 --> 01:16:11.610
And go home.

1281
01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:14.613
What do you say?

1282
01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:18.617
No.

1283
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.576
What?

1284
01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:22.621
You don't want to be with me.

1285
01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:27.104
Honestly. I don't think you know
what you want. and that is OK.

1286
01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:31.935
I tell you. you were right about
one thing though.

1287
01:16:31.978 --> 01:16:33.284
Yeah?

1288
01:16:34.067 --> 01:16:35.678
We are on different paths.

1289
01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:37.070
Huh.

1290
01:16:38.115 --> 01:16:39.769
You take care. OK Kyle?

1291
01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:43.773
And a word of advice...

1292
01:16:44.904 --> 01:16:46.732
next time pick your own
vacation spot.

1293
01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:52.695
Yeah. that's fair enough.

1294
01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:02.139
Hey.

1295
01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.231
Oh. come here.

1296
01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:42.266
Olivia. it's Alexander.
are you feeling alright?

1297
01:17:46.444 --> 01:17:47.488
Olivia?

1298
01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:50.578
Alexander...

1299
01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:54.757
What is it?

1300
01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.672
From Katie.

1301
01:18:07.944 --> 01:18:09.380
It's nice and strong.

1302
01:18:09.423 --> 01:18:11.208
Mm. thank you.

1303
01:18:16.126 --> 01:18:17.910
- What did you do?
- Pardon?

1304
01:18:17.954 --> 01:18:19.433
What did you tell her?

1305
01:18:19.477 --> 01:18:23.089
Darling. I told her the truth.
nothing more.

1306
01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:26.310
Typical.

1307
01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:27.591
I should have known that you
would try...

1308
01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:29.182
Darling. don't be so dramatic.

1309
01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:33.621
I was acting in your best
interests. you know that.

1310
01:18:34.797 --> 01:18:37.495
Winston. would you please
help me pack our things.

1311
01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:39.062
We're returning to America.

1312
01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:40.150
Yes. Alexand...

1313
01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:43.196
Your Highness.

1314
01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.981
Alexander...

1315
01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:48.071
Alexander!

1316
01:18:48.114 --> 01:18:51.248
I forbid you from throwing away
your future

1317
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:54.860
in pursuit of some schoolboy
crush with this middling writer.

1318
01:18:57.297 --> 01:18:59.647
Do you have any idea
how elitist you sound?

1319
01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:03.086
It is imperative that we
preserve our royal customs.

1320
01:19:03.129 --> 01:19:06.263
Our culture and our traditions
and everything. you know this.

1321
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:10.006
And what about how happy
you said I could be

1322
01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:11.964
if I found the right person?

1323
01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.184
Remember that?

1324
01:19:14.227 --> 01:19:16.099
When did that change mother?

1325
01:19:18.666 --> 01:19:20.166
When did your pride
become more important

1326
01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:21.234
than our happiness?

1327
01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:22.670
How dare you!

1328
01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:24.274
You claim to act in my best
interests...

1329
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.893
but what I have. I always felt
that my life

1330
01:19:27.937 --> 01:19:29.939
is just another bullet point
on your itinerary.

1331
01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:31.418
Alexander that is enough!

1332
01:19:32.245 --> 01:19:34.204
Do you know what the tragedy is?

1333
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.690
You and I are in
precisely the same predicament.

1334
01:19:42.734 --> 01:19:44.127
What are you talking about?

1335
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.130
Can't believe I never noticed it
until last night.

1336
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:49.915
How long have you had feelings
for Ridley. mother?

1337
01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:52.918
Feelings?
Are you out of your mind?

1338
01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:54.417
Actually. it was Olivia
who pointed it out.

1339
01:19:54.441 --> 01:19:56.139
She knew immediately.

1340
01:19:56.182 --> 01:19:58.054
Quite perceptive
wouldn't you say?

1341
01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:08.804
Mother...

1342
01:20:12.242 --> 01:20:14.157
it's alright.

1343
01:20:18.422 --> 01:20:20.119
You can talk to me.

1344
01:20:28.084 --> 01:20:29.607
When your father died I...

1345
01:20:31.043 --> 01:20:32.566
I was so lonely.

1346
01:20:35.047 --> 01:20:36.483
Ridley was just so kind.

1347
01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:42.185
So considerate.

1348
01:20:42.228 --> 01:20:44.100
And you never once thought
of pursuing it?

1349
01:20:44.143 --> 01:20:45.928
We can't. It'd be a scandal.

1350
01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:47.538
Perhaps once.

1351
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:51.411
But times have changed
and we have to change too.

1352
01:20:53.196 --> 01:20:55.502
We can't sacrifice what we know
to be right

1353
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.896
because of our dated traditions.

1354
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:02.945
Mother...

1355
01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:07.863
please don't make a mistake
you might regret forever.

1356
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:12.824
And thank you...

1357
01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.741
for always being there for me.
I know it can't have been easy.

1358
01:21:19.744 --> 01:21:21.485
But I'm not a boy anymore.

1359
01:21:24.749 --> 01:21:26.490
And you have to trust me.

1360
01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:46.787
So. what do you think?

1361
01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:50.313
<i>Just... absolutely... brilliant.</i>

1362
01:22:50.356 --> 01:22:52.184
<i>I mean. we all knew
you could do it.</i>

1363
01:22:52.228 --> 01:22:55.013
<i>Romance. royalty.
a tropical island.</i>

1364
01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:56.188
<i>It has everything!</i>

1365
01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:57.276
Right.

1366
01:22:58.712 --> 01:23:00.627
Oh. excuse me.
Dumplings are here.

1367
01:23:01.585 --> 01:23:05.589
<i>There's just one minor point
that jumps out to me...</i>

1368
01:23:05.632 --> 01:23:07.072
- Yeah. come on up.
<i>- One small note.</i>

1369
01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:08.200
Sure what is it?

1370
01:23:08.244 --> 01:23:09.636
<i>The ending.</i>

1371
01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.856
<i>I mean. they have to
end up together.</i>

1372
01:23:12.596 --> 01:23:14.250
Why?

1373
01:23:14.293 --> 01:23:16.600
<i>Because. darling.
readers want happy endings.</i>

1374
01:23:16.643 --> 01:23:19.951
<i>People want affirming.
uplifting stories.</i>

1375
01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.126
I get that.

1376
01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:25.348
But life is complex
and unexpected and weird

1377
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:27.480
and sometimes things
don't work out.

1378
01:23:27.524 --> 01:23:29.526
<i>But your readers expect...</i>

1379
01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:31.745
<i>fairytale endings.
that's why they're reading.</i>

1380
01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:33.878
Well. I am telling it like it is

1381
01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:36.315
and fairytale endings
don't happen.

1382
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.189
I don't know if I believe that.

1383
01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:42.930
How did you know where I...

1384
01:23:42.974 --> 01:23:45.150
- Hi.
- Seriously?

1385
01:23:47.718 --> 01:23:49.111
Look. I know you're freaking
out.

1386
01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:51.417
but just let us in
and we will explain.

1387
01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:54.420
Olivia. please hear me out.

1388
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.385
But what are you doing here?

1389
01:24:03.212 --> 01:24:05.301
Well. while I'm here.
I'm taking a series of meetings

1390
01:24:05.344 --> 01:24:06.519
for my new foundation.

1391
01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.916
But the real reason I came
was to see you.

1392
01:24:13.918 --> 01:24:15.789
Olivia. I'm so deeply sorry
for what happened.

1393
01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:17.748
but I couldn't leave things
as they were.

1394
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:22.100
Not when I feel the way I do
about you.

1395
01:24:22.144 --> 01:24:23.580
<i>Ah... darling. hello?</i>

1396
01:24:23.623 --> 01:24:25.234
Alexander we don't have to
do this.

1397
01:24:26.278 --> 01:24:27.801
Just go do your kinging

1398
01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:30.065
with someone appropriate to do
the queening

1399
01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.762
and I will move on with my life.

1400
01:24:31.805 --> 01:24:33.807
Olivia. please believe me
when I say

1401
01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:36.332
you're the only person
I'm interested in being with.

1402
01:24:38.508 --> 01:24:40.031
Have you run this past
your mother?

1403
01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.077
Because I think she might have
other plans.

1404
01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:44.905
About that.

1405
01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:54.045
- OK. what is happening now?
- Trust me.

1406
01:25:02.836 --> 01:25:05.056
Your Majesty.

1407
01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.971
Hello again. Olivia.

1408
01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:08.538
<i>Who is that?</i>

1409
01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.280
I wish to apologise.

1410
01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:16.023
I was frightfully rude and
meddling where I shouldn't.

1411
01:25:19.201 --> 01:25:20.463
Thank you.

1412
01:25:21.203 --> 01:25:23.901
Actually. it is I who should
thank you.

1413
01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:27.557
Truth is I've always been
committed

1414
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.428
to protecting my family.

1415
01:25:29.472 --> 01:25:30.995
but somewhere along the way

1416
01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:33.780
I lost sight of what that is
supposed to mean.

1417
01:25:34.738 --> 01:25:38.045
A mother should respect
her child's choices.

1418
01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:42.137
And not let antiquated ideas

1419
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.834
get in the way
of their happiness.

1420
01:25:45.618 --> 01:25:47.229
Or her own.

1421
01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:55.193
Nice to see you again. Ma'am.

1422
01:25:55.237 --> 01:25:58.327
Please accept my apologies for
my deception on the Haven Isles.

1423
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:59.806
Don't mention it.

1424
01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:03.351
We couldn't have done this
over the phone?

1425
01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.899
Well. that's not very princely.
is it?

1426
01:26:08.206 --> 01:26:09.566
Would you give us a moment.
please?

1427
01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:12.210
- Lunch. Ridley?
- I'd be delighted.

1428
01:26:27.965 --> 01:26:29.769
Do you remember when I told you
I'm not very good

1429
01:26:29.793 --> 01:26:32.153
at finding the right words to
capture precisely what I feel?

1430
01:26:34.667 --> 01:26:36.408
Well...

1431
01:26:38.018 --> 01:26:39.585
I'm in love with you.

1432
01:26:43.285 --> 01:26:44.634
That wasn't bad.

1433
01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:51.206
Olivia. I must confess...

1434
01:26:51.902 --> 01:26:53.251
a royal life can be challenging.

1435
01:26:53.295 --> 01:26:56.211
there are compromises
and expectations.

1436
01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:00.780
But. if you're willing to try...

1437
01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:05.916
I promise you we could have
an amazing adventure.

1438
01:27:11.443 --> 01:27:12.705
What do you say?

1439
01:27:17.623 --> 01:27:20.800
I think I might take one more
shot at that fairytale ending.

1440
01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:24.456
<i>Darling. can I just clarify.</i>

1441
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.197
<i>when you say fairytale ending</i>

1442
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:29.374
<i>do you mean the two of you
or the book?</i>

1443
01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:31.420
Both.
