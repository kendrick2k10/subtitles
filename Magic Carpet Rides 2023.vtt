suggest that place. Margo.

because it's like kind
of perfect vibes.

Like. it's not too romantic.
but it's like not boring.

and I wasn't sure if you
were gonna wanna get food.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.425

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.992
like I have bad taste in food.

and no. I'm like spiraling.

- Do you think I'm putting
in the world

155

No.

00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:36.526
Definitely not.

162
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.399
But maybe you are getting
in your own way.

163
00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:41.139
- Wait. what does
that mean though?

164
00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:42.445
Are you gonna do at VidCon?

165
00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:43.620
Ah. my God.

166
00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:45.317
I hate that you asked
that question

167
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:46.493
because I can't do the course

168
00:06:46.536 --> 00:06:47.842
I wanted to teach on eyebrows

169
00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:49.234
and what it says about
your personality.

170
00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:50.540
because literally.
10 other people

171
00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:51.933
are gonna be doing
the same thing.

172
00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:52.890
- Oh yeah.
- Okay.

173
00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:54.065
But what if you made it funny?

174
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:55.415
- Yeah. I guess I can
make it funny.

175
00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:56.503
- I think I'm just gonna
do a panel on identity

176
00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:58.113
so I can like. phone it in.

177
00:06:58.156 --> 00:07:00.071
- Callie. I feel like you
should do a speed dating thing

178

where you host it like
your toxic girlfriend.

00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:10.168
- I'm not gonna go to
VidCon this year.

186
00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:11.300
- Wait. what?
- What?

187
00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:12.780
- Why?
- You?

188
00:07:12.823 --> 00:07:15.304
- No. I just like. I haven't
heard anything about it.

189
00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:17.785
and so I feel like I might
not be featured this year.

190
00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:18.916
which is fine.

191
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.309
Oh my God.

192
00:07:20.352 --> 00:07:22.354
You didn't get the email?

saying you wanna lean more

195
00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:28.056
into hosting anyways. right?

196
00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.624
Maybe this is a sign
from the universe

197
00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.756
and like a hosting gig is
gonna pop up that weekend.

198
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.715
And thank God you weren't
committed to VidCon

199
00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:35.977
so you can do it.

200
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.239
So excited for you.

201
00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.283
This is great.

00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:39.371
Oh my God.

203
00:07:40.198 --> 00:07:41.591
Is that Chantal Diamond Head?

204
00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:42.984
I live for Chantal.

205
00:07:43.027 --> 00:07:43.985
No. no.

206
00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.334
I hate the Diamond Head family.

207
00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:46.683
- What?
- Okay.

208
00:07:46.727 --> 00:07:48.555
So I on vacation and
I met one of them

209
00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.818
then I stopped all of them.
then I followed all of them.

210
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:51.993
but then they didn't
follow me back.

211
00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:53.560
So I unfollowed them.

212
00:07:53.603 --> 00:07:54.691
And now. I'm in a fight with
the whole fucking family.

213
00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:56.258
I don't think it's a fight

214
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.477
if the other person doesn't
know that you're fighting.

215
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.304
- I think you should
go say something.

216
00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:01.611
They should know how bad
that they hurted you.

217
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:03.265
Hold me back. guys.

218
00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:05.006

Your little bones will break.

223
00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:12.100

These shit coins are
not a pump and dump.

If you're smart. you
play the pump.

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:20.990
What happened to your phone?

368
00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:22.339
- Nothing. I just
don't have one.

369
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.427
You don't own a phone?

370
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.385
Nope.

371
00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:25.299
Why don't you own a phone.

372
00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:26.300
I just don't own a phone.

373
00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:27.779
I don't need it.

374
00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:28.737
- What do you mean you
don't need a phone?

375
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.738
I mean. I don't need a phone.

376
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:31.174
But how do you like.

377
00:14:31.218 --> 00:14:33.481
call people or look stuff
up or get directions?

378
00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:36.614
Or can you even buy
anything without a phone?

379
00:14:36.658 --> 00:14:38.703
- Do you need to answer
these questions individually

380
00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.053
or is this like a
global sort of?

381
00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:40.880
No. okay.

382
00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:42.055
- Philosophical.
- Okay.

383
00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:43.230
Like what do you do for work?

384
00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:45.014
I work on boats.

385
00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:45.885
It's weird.

386
00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:49.671
Okay. so don't they need
to call you and be like.

387
00:14:49.714 --> 00:14:54.763
"Hey. can you come work
on this boat at 12:15?"

388
00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:56.243
- No. it's kinda hard for
me to miss an appointment

389
00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:57.722
'cause I live on the dock.

390
00:14:57.766 --> 00:14:58.723
You live on a dock?

391
00:14:58.767 --> 00:14:59.768
Yeah. I live on the dock.

392
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:00.900
Are you a merman?

393
00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:01.813
No.

394
00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:04.904
Oh my.

395
00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:06.731
Oh. I'm sorry.

396
00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:07.863
You're homeless?

397
00:15:09.256 --> 00:15:10.779
Are you serious?

398
00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:12.912
Are you not homeless?

399
00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:14.130
No. I live on a boat.

400
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:19.135
- Is that not the same
as being homeless?

401
00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:22.225
No. [chuckles]

402
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:23.270
What do you do for work?

403
00:15:23.313 --> 00:15:24.488
I'm a content creator.

404
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:25.925
You're a what?

405
00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:27.361
Yeah. I'm an influencer.

406
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:28.492
- Run for your life.
- Oh my God.

407
00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:31.974
- Nobody's safe.
- I didn't say that.

408
00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:33.802
Sorry your date left
you at the bar.

409
00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:34.934
He wasn't my date.

410
00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:35.891
- He looked like he
was your date.

411
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.849
Yeah. well. not everybody's

412
00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:39.590
what everything they look like.

413
00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:44.160
- That stuff's all
pretty fake. yeah?

414
00:15:44.204 --> 00:15:45.074
What stuff?

415
00:15:45.118 --> 00:15:46.771
Like the influencer stuff?

416
00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:48.773
It's fake.

417
00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:50.384
Fake. how?

418
00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:51.733
- Like when you're talking.
it's not really you talking.

419
00:15:51.776 --> 00:15:52.734
it's like a fake you talking.

420
00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:54.431
Ah. no. there's not a fake me.

421
00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.693
It's like a persona.

422
00:15:55.737 --> 00:15:56.564
- I wouldn't say that
there's a fake me.

423
00:15:56.607 --> 00:15:57.782
I talk about my real life.

424
00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:58.740
It's really me.

425
00:15:58.783 --> 00:15:59.784
I don't have any filters.

426
00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:01.961
I vomit everything out.

427
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:03.266
Would you do that?

428
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.006
- Like in real life.
- Why would you do that?

429
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:04.702
Because I do that.

430
00:16:05.877 --> 00:16:07.879
- But when you're talking.
you're not talking to anybody.

431
00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:08.793
I'm talking to everybody.

432
00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:09.620
That sounds lonely.

433
00:16:09.664 --> 00:16:10.665
It's not lonely.

434
00:16:11.753 --> 00:16:13.059
- Okay. let me ask
you something.

435
00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:16.497
When you're selling
soap to people.

436
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.977
you believe they
should buy that?

437
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.370
No. but everybody knows that.

438
00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:23.634
Everybody knows. oh. that's
just how she makes her money.

439
00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:25.201
Like. I'm so sorry.

440
00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:26.942
I'm really sorry for
having a job.

441
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:27.899
But it's not just a job.

442
00:16:27.943 --> 00:16:28.639
It sounds like it's your life.

443
00:16:28.683 --> 00:16:30.032
It is just a job.

444
00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:32.513
And I don't sell soap.
I've never sold soap.

445
00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:33.688
It's just a job.

446
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:34.297
Why do you keep checking
your phone?

447
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:35.429
I don't know.

448
00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:36.343
I guess I'm just addicted
to work.

Checks out.

455
00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:21.518
- So thank you for
walking me home.

456
00:17:22.563 --> 00:17:26.436
The conversation was really
weird. but the safety was nice.

457
00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:34.444
Bye.

Oh. bless you.

- Okay. now you literally
need to tell me everything.

475
00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:16.476
- So thank you for
walking me home.

476
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:17.346
No.

477
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.742
He's cute.

478
00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:22.873
- I suck and put my
tongue in that.

479
00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:24.484
Did he sleep over?

480
00:20:24.527 --> 00:20:25.398
Is he circumcised?

481
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:27.269
No. he walked me home.

482
00:20:27.313 --> 00:20:29.271
Why are you watching
our ring footage?

483
00:20:29.315 --> 00:20:32.666
- Because I don't remember
how I got home last night.

484
00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:35.146
So I needed the reading
footage to replenish my memory.

485
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.496
Yeah. you came home with me.

486
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.498
Remember you were crying
'cause Jake Gillen all.

487
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:39.499
Who's the dude. Cal?

488
00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:41.022
He's no one.

489
00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:43.372
He lives on a boat and
he doesn't have a phone.

490
00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:44.199
He's super weird.

491
00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.374
- Callie.
- What?

492
00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:46.419
Did you look at it?

493
00:20:46.462 --> 00:20:47.289
No.

494
00:20:49.509 --> 00:20:50.597
He peed on me.

495
00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:54.949
- I remember when a
dude peed on me.

496
00:20:54.992 --> 00:20:56.385
That shit is different.

497
00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:58.605
- So we peed on each
other in an alley.

498
00:20:58.648 --> 00:20:59.562
Hot.

499
00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:00.563
- So hot.
- Really hot.

500
00:21:00.607 --> 00:21:02.304
- Did you ask if
he has any STDs?

501
00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.611
Okay. so what's happening?

502
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:06.265
- I will literally never
see him again.

503
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:07.178
Bummer.

504
00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:12.923
- That Thomas guy messaged
me again.

Hey. second date.

506
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:16.840
He asked me for pics.

Gross. always fucking pigs.

508
00:21:18.364 --> 00:21:20.235
- I know. but then he
asked me out again.

509
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.106
- We can't be rewarding
that behavior.

510
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:22.933
- But I feel-

511
00:21:22.977 --> 00:21:24.326
No. Callie. no.

512
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.501
- Okay. but maybe he was
like drunk or something.

513
00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:26.807
- No. we don't make
excuses for boys.

514
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.897
- But like I could give
him a second chance.

515
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.941
Yeah. maybe.

516
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:32.595

00:30:43.232 --> 00:30:44.407
when he asked me for nudes.

730
00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:45.365
But I don't think he's gonna-

731
00:30:45.408 --> 00:30:46.540
But he asked you for nudes.

732
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:49.195
Yeah. and that part was weird.

733
00:30:49.238 --> 00:30:50.283
I know that part was weird.

734
00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:51.414
Did you send them?

735
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:52.720
No. oh my God. No.

736
00:30:52.763 --> 00:30:53.764
I'm looking for love.

737
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:55.810
Not starting an OnlyFans.

738
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:58.682
What's an OnlyFans?

739
00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:01.424
It's like a sex thing.

740
00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:02.904
It's like an online sex thing

741
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:05.341
or I guess they send
me an email being like.

742
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:06.429
"We have a violinist.

743
00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:07.430
It's not just sex."

744
00:31:07.604 --> 00:31:10.085
But everybody knows
it's purely sex.

745
00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:13.480
[jazz music]

746
00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:22.489
- Are you good?
- Hmm?

747
00:31:22.532 --> 00:31:25.100
- You okay?
- Yeah.

748
00:31:25.144 --> 00:31:26.362
Yeah. I'm just.

749
00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:27.668
I feel like I'm just
a little hyper aware

750
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:29.322
because I feel like he
might have texted me

751
00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:30.758
saying he's still coming

752
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:32.586
and then he is gonna walk
in and see me with you

753
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:34.631
and he's gonna cause a scene.

754
00:31:34.675 --> 00:31:36.895
And the only thing that's on
the menu that's gluten-free

755
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:38.635
and dairy-free is a side salad.

756
00:31:38.679 --> 00:31:40.507
So I'm just imagining
him running in.

757
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.857
making a scene and I'm
sitting here in a restaurant

758
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.903
eating a side salad
and that would look

759
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.427
really fucking obnoxious.

760
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.038
- So you're allergic
to gluten and dairy?

761
00:31:50.082 --> 00:31:52.301
- No. I just. I only
eat it on Saturdays

762
00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:53.955
and the third Wednesday
of every month.

763
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:54.913
Why only the third Wednesday?

764
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.218
That's when I get my period.

765
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:00.005
Okay.

766
00:32:00.048 --> 00:32:01.789
Well I think that you should
order whatever you want. Callie

767
00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:02.921
'cause nobody gives a shit.

768
00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:04.400
Everybody gives a shit.

769
00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:05.662
Nobody gives a shit.

770
00:32:05.706 --> 00:32:06.663
I give a shit.

771
00:32:06.707 --> 00:32:07.534
Then stop.

772
00:32:07.577 --> 00:32:08.665
Just stop giving a shit.

773
00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:09.362
- I can't just stop
giving a shit.

774
00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:11.059
Yes you can.

775
00:32:11.103 --> 00:32:12.756
I think you only care 'cause
you think everybody else cares.

776
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.846
- Well. I mean. people
like. look at me.

777
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.152
- People look at you?
- Yeah.

778
00:32:17.196 --> 00:32:17.979
Who?

779
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:19.198
Who in here?

780
00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:20.242
I'm the only person
you're looking at.

781
00:32:20.503 --> 00:32:22.201
- Okay. that guy's literally
filming me.

782
00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:26.901
I'm just gonna...

783
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:27.684
- No. can you please.
don't do that.

784
00:32:27.728 --> 00:32:28.772
Please don't do that.

785
00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:29.948
Pardon me.

786
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:31.427
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

787
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:32.559
Are you filming her?

788
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:37.085
- No. I just can't really
see my menu.

789
00:32:37.129 --> 00:32:39.653
It's kinda dark in
here. so I was...

790
00:32:39.696 --> 00:32:42.351
I wouldn't be filming her.

791
00:32:42.395 --> 00:32:43.439
Right.

792
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.441
- That'd be weird.
- That would be weird.

793
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:47.400
Sorry. thank you.

794
00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:49.097
Enjoy your dinner.

795
00:32:49.141 --> 00:32:51.056
The simone salad is wonderful.

796
00:32:52.274 --> 00:32:53.188
Excuse me.

797
00:32:54.146 --> 00:32:54.973
Hi.

798
00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:55.930
Hi. good evening.

799
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:56.887
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

800
00:32:56.931 --> 00:32:59.803
Do you know this young woman?

801
00:32:59.847 --> 00:33:00.717
No.

802
00:33:02.328 --> 00:33:03.546
- Yeah. I'm not her
date by the way.

803
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.895
Her dates stood her up.

804
00:33:04.939 --> 00:33:05.853
- I'm just sort of a-
- Oh no.

805
00:33:05.896 --> 00:33:08.508
- Kinda like a stand-in date.

806
00:33:08.551 --> 00:33:10.249
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

807
00:33:10.292 --> 00:33:11.293
Enjoy your dinner.

808
00:33:11.337 --> 00:33:12.207
Sorry.

809
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:14.993
Well.

810
00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:18.170
Yeah. that's hilarious.

811
00:33:18.213 --> 00:33:19.214
No one cares about me.

812
00:33:19.258 --> 00:33:20.520
That's really funny.

813
00:33:20.563 --> 00:33:21.651
No. that's not.

814
00:33:21.695 --> 00:33:23.523
I'm just saying that people

815
00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:25.351
are only thinking
about themselves.

816
00:33:25.394 --> 00:33:26.787
Like you shouldn't care so much.

817
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.354
Yeah. until they're not.

818
00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:30.356
And they're posting Instagrams
of you eating sour cream

819
00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:31.748
on your taco saying
you're hypocrite

820
00:33:31.792 --> 00:33:33.185
'cause you say you
don't need dairy.

821
00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:35.361
And then apparently. did
you know Mexican food?

822
00:33:35.404 --> 00:33:37.493
Like real Mexican food
doesn't have sour creams?

823
00:33:37.537 --> 00:33:39.191
- Everybody knows it.
- So.

824
00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:41.802
Okay well. apparently.
it's cultural appropriation

825
00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:43.325
if you put sour cream
on your taco.

826
00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:45.110
so then you start getting
death threats in your DMs

827
00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:46.937
because you're insensitive.

828
00:33:46.981 --> 00:33:48.678
- Wow.
- Yeah.

829
00:33:48.722 --> 00:33:50.245
Thank you.

830
00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:52.378
I had to post an apology
video and then they tore that

831
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:53.988
to shreds because I
smiled at the end.

832
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:55.772
- Well Callie. why would
you even do it then?

833
00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:56.686
Why do any of this?

834
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:57.818
It doesn't seem worth it.

835
00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:59.863
I mean it is worth it.

836
00:33:59.907 --> 00:34:01.561
Look. I'm not just
a clout chaser.

837
00:34:01.604 --> 00:34:03.389
It's like a means to an end.

838
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:04.259
It's a vehicle.

839
00:34:04.303 --> 00:34:05.695
I wanna host my own show.

840
00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:08.568
You have to be someone
before you can be someone.

841
00:34:08.611 --> 00:34:09.525
You wanna host your own show?

842
00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:10.439
Yeah.

843
00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:13.268
That's really cool.

844
00:34:13.834 --> 00:34:16.402
- Yeah. that would be really
cool if it ever happened.

845
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.493
[Callie exhales]

846
00:34:20.536 --> 00:34:21.537
Hey. Maria.

847
00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:22.408
I'm sorry.

848
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:23.235
Wait. you know her?

849
00:34:23.278 --> 00:34:24.801
Yeah.

850
00:34:24.845 --> 00:34:29.545
Can we get a bottle of
your finest cheapest cap?

851
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:30.372
The mythic blend?

852
00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:31.199
Mythic blend.

853
00:34:31.243 --> 00:34:32.853
Yeah. that's the one.

854
00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:34.681
And then can we get a margarita
pizza but with a pesto base

855
00:34:34.724 --> 00:34:36.509
instead of the olive.

856
00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:37.771
And then let's do a
side of Parmesan fries.

857
00:34:37.814 --> 00:34:39.164
We'll separate the Parmesan.

858
00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:40.904
we'll do the Javier sauce
extra with that.

859
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:42.210
And let's do a side of wings

860
00:34:42.254 --> 00:34:46.040
and a gluten-free. dairy-free
side salad.

861
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:50.131
You can...

862
00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:50.914
I don't need the side salad.

863
00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:51.872
- Okay.
- Thank you.

864
00:34:51.915 --> 00:34:52.786
Is that all?

865
00:34:54.483 --> 00:34:56.355
- Yeah. thank you.
- Okay.

866
00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:01.751
You order like a child.

867
00:35:01.795 --> 00:35:03.623
- They have a good ice
cream here too.

868
00:35:05.233 --> 00:35:06.365
So like personal style

869
00:35:06.408 --> 00:35:08.236
is different than like
being trendy.

870
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.456
So like. you can have
personal style

871
00:35:10.499 --> 00:35:12.197
but doesn't necessarily
follow trends.

872
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.720
But if you're trendy. you're
like following the trends

873
00:35:13.763 --> 00:35:15.939
but you don't necessarily
have personal style.

874
00:35:15.983 --> 00:35:17.289
So it depends if you
wanna be trendy

875
00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:18.986
or you wanna have
personal style.

876
00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:19.813
Right.

877
00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.293
So I would say like.

878
00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:22.381
you have personal style
'cause you're not trendy.

879
00:35:22.424 --> 00:35:23.033
- Thank you.
- It's not a bad thing.

880
00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:23.860
I'm not. oh.

881
00:35:23.904 --> 00:35:25.035
Whenever you're ready.

882
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:26.124
- Thank you.
- Thank you. thank you.

883
00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:27.429
No. I got it. I got it.

884
00:35:27.473 --> 00:35:28.300
- No. you weren't even
supposed to be here.

885
00:35:28.343 --> 00:35:29.170
- It's fine.
- No. no.

886
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:30.476
No. it's seriously fine.

887
00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:31.825
All right. let's split it.

888
00:35:31.868 --> 00:35:33.000
- I will still think you
are a big strong man.

889
00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:34.088
- No. let's split it.
- Relax. Relax.

890
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.395
- Let's do half cash
and then half.

891
00:35:36.438 --> 00:35:37.265
Thank you.

892
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.137
That's very sweet.

893
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.877
Can I have my phone back?

894
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:43.402
Because I think my mom has
probably texted me like 95 times.

895
00:35:43.445 --> 00:35:46.056
Maybe even filed a missing
person's report by now.

896
00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:49.059
- This is why I don't
have a phone.

897
00:35:49.103 --> 00:35:50.235
So my mom can't text you?

898
00:35:50.278 --> 00:35:51.845
No. because...

899
00:35:53.107 --> 00:35:54.674
I've met people like you.

900
00:35:54.717 --> 00:35:55.936
People like me.

901
00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:58.634
- And you can barely
hold a conversation.

902
00:35:58.678 --> 00:36:00.897
- I can barely?
- It's not your fault.

903
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:01.942
- I'm very easily holding
a conversation.

904
00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:03.291
It's the phone's fault.

905
00:36:03.335 --> 00:36:04.858
- Some people don't
have anything in common.

906
00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:06.816
so there's nothing to talk
about but that's not my fault.

907
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.991
This is sort of like
one of those

908
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:09.689
two-way street kinda thing.

909
00:36:09.732 --> 00:36:10.646
Thank you.

910
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.521
It's not your fault.

911

[romantic music]

912
00:36:33.756 --> 00:36:34.540
What's happened?

913
00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:35.541
Is the world ending?

914
00:36:35.584 --> 00:36:37.325
- The world has ended.
- Mm.

915
00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:40.894
[romantic music]

916
00:36:40.937 --> 00:36:41.808
What?

917
00:36:44.637 --> 00:36:45.507
What?

918
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:48.684
- I bet you couldn't
go a day without it.

919
00:36:48.728 --> 00:36:50.382
I could very easily do that.

920
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.427
Mm?

921
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:53.341
I could.

922
00:36:53.385 --> 00:36:54.473
I could very easily do that.

923
00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:56.039
- Mm.
- It wouldn't be a problem.

924
00:36:58.868 --> 00:36:59.739
Huh?

925
00:37:02.394 --> 00:37:03.351
Prove it.

926
00:37:03.395 --> 00:37:04.613
How would I prove that?

927
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:05.962
Meet me tomorrow.

928
00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:07.529
No phone.

929
00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:09.009
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.

930
00:37:09.052 --> 00:37:09.923
Meet me

931
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:16.234
at this address at 2 PM

932
00:37:16.277 --> 00:37:19.237
with no phone.

933
00:37:20.803 --> 00:37:22.457
Are you asking me out?

934
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:27.288
Or is this a weird experiment
that you're gonna do on me?

935
00:37:27.332 --> 00:37:28.855
Just show up.

936
00:37:28.898 --> 00:37:30.509
- Okay. I'm not gonna just
show up at a random address

937
00:37:30.552 --> 00:37:32.946
because that's an insane
thing to expect me to do.

938
00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:33.773
It's not insane.

939
00:37:33.816 --> 00:37:34.643
It is insane.

940
00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:35.514
Hey. Callie.

941
00:37:35.557 --> 00:37:36.384
Yes?

942
00:37:36.428 --> 00:37:37.255
Just show up.

943
00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:43.957
I have had a lovely time.

944
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.480
We should do this again.

945
00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:47.961
I think you're a phone addict.

946
00:37:48.004 --> 00:37:50.616
- I think you are
a napkin addict.

947
00:37:52.226 --> 00:37:53.358
I'll see you tomorrow.

948
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:54.533
[Callie] Bye. Leo.

949
00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:55.577
2 PM.

950
00:38:01.061 --> 00:38:02.062
Okay. Callie.

951
00:38:02.105 --> 00:38:03.759
- You have to go.
- I can't go.

952
00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:06.327
- I mean. it kind of is the
perfect narrative for your page.

953
00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:09.765
Like. I got peed on by a
guy who lives on a boat.

954
00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:11.593
completely outside
of modern society.

955
00:38:11.637 --> 00:38:13.203
So now I'm gonna go
live in his wall

956
00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:14.161
and try and fall in love.

957
00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:15.684
I mean. my God.

958
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:16.685
It's so you.

959
00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:18.252
Yeah.

960
00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:19.079
And you're dwindling following
of Ava Kelly fan girl

961
00:38:19.122 --> 00:38:20.123
is gonna eat that shit up.

962
00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:20.689
- Yes.
- Yeah. that was harsh.

963
00:38:20.733 --> 00:38:21.603
It was?

964
00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:22.778
No. it's not dwindling.

965
00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:24.389
Oh. it's not growing.

966
00:38:24.432 --> 00:38:26.565
- So wait. you just want me
to use this man for my page?

967
00:38:26.608 --> 00:38:28.349
- I just want you to find
love in all this place.

968
00:38:28.393 --> 00:38:30.395
- You literally use
every single man

969
00:38:30.438 --> 00:38:31.831
that you meet for your page.

970
00:38:33.136 --> 00:38:37.010
- But I don't go into it
saying that I'm gonna use them.

971
00:38:37.053 --> 00:38:38.751
- Okay. we're gonna
let that lie.

972
00:38:38.794 --> 00:38:39.665
Lie.

973
00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:40.579
I don't.

974
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:45.148
He wouldn't agree to it.

975
00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:45.975
How would he know?

976
00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:46.889
Nobody's gonna know.

977
00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:48.238
They're gonna know how.

978
00:38:48.282 --> 00:38:49.501
- How would they know?
- How would they know?

979
00:38:49.544 --> 00:38:50.763
Oh my God.

980
00:38:50.806 --> 00:38:52.504
- Okay. but seriously.
how would he know?

981
00:38:52.547 --> 00:38:54.549
- Just literally make videos
about how this guy lives.

982
00:38:54.593 --> 00:38:55.637
People are gonna love it.

983
00:38:55.681 --> 00:38:57.030
Oh. I'm gonna follow you.

984
00:38:57.073 --> 00:38:59.772
- Especially if he scraps
his boat shirtless.

985
00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:01.077
Yeah. people are so horny.

986
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:02.644
- I am.
- I am.

987
00:39:02.688 --> 00:39:04.211
I'm asexual.

988
00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:06.431
- I'm really into girls
and never guys.

989
00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:10.739
Hi guys.

990
00:39:10.783 --> 00:39:12.219
Against my better judgment.

991
00:39:12.262 --> 00:39:17.224
I'm gonna be doing something
kinda crazy. kinda wild.

992
00:39:17.442 --> 00:39:19.487
So I met this guy after
he peed on my feet.

993
00:39:19.531 --> 00:39:21.663
Well he didn't mean
to pee on my feet.

994
00:39:21.707 --> 00:39:24.666
like we peed on each
other's feet in an alleyway.

995
00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:29.149
Anyways. I'm gonna be completely
off my phone tomorrow.

996
00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:30.498
Not even a story.

997
00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:31.543
I know.

998
00:39:31.847 --> 00:39:33.936
I know. it's like a
whole new world for me.

999
00:39:34.546 --> 00:39:36.374
I think it'll be good though.

1000
00:39:36.417 --> 00:39:39.333
Maybe you guys should do
it with me. I don't know.

1001
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.030
Anyways. I love you. all.

1002
00:39:41.074 --> 00:39:42.336
I'm gonna miss you.

1003
00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:44.730
Bye.

1004
00:39:46.122 --> 00:39:46.993
Bye.

1005
00:39:47.994 --> 00:39:49.735
Bye.

[waltz music]

1007
00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.181
[waltz music continues]

1008
00:40:09.755 --> 00:40:10.930
So is this it?

1009
00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:13.933
- Hm?
- Is this it?

1010
00:40:13.976 --> 00:40:15.108
This is all we do?

1011
00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:16.805
What do you mean?

1012
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:18.720
- We just pedal around for an
hour and then we go back in?

1013
00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:19.939
No. no.

1014
00:40:19.982 --> 00:40:24.639
We are together at a lake.

1015
00:40:24.683 --> 00:40:26.162
Enjoying it.

1016
00:40:26.206 --> 00:40:27.294
Yeah.

1017
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:28.861
- Right?
- Right.

1018
00:40:28.904 --> 00:40:30.471
On a beautiful day.

1019
00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:31.951
What more could you ask for?

1020
00:40:34.562 --> 00:40:35.955
- Can't believe you'd
take me on a boat

1021
00:40:35.998 --> 00:40:37.783
a month after I tell
you I don't like swans.

1022
00:40:37.826 --> 00:40:39.437
Okay. I looked it up online

1023
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.351
and it said this was
a good date idea.

1024
00:40:41.395 --> 00:40:42.831
For who? Birds?

1025
00:40:42.875 --> 00:40:44.920
- For couples who spend
time together.

1026
00:40:46.182 --> 00:40:51.187
- So. did you boat any
rich people yesterday?

1027
00:40:52.188 --> 00:40:53.146
I did. I did.

1028
00:40:53.189 --> 00:40:55.148
I boated a bunch of rich people.

1029
00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:57.193
Did you video about
stretchy pants?

1030
00:40:57.237 --> 00:40:58.673
Stretchy. no.

1031
00:40:58.717 --> 00:41:00.153
Guacamole.

1032
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:01.067
Stretchy pants guacamole?

1033
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.112
No. just guacamole.

1034
00:41:03.156 --> 00:41:04.157
Guacamole. that's not bad.

1035
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.419
- Yeah. but it's
kinda unsettling

1036
00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:07.247
'cause the guac doesn't
turn brown.

1037
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.074
Doesn't turn brown.

1038
00:41:08.117 --> 00:41:09.641
- Hm-mm.

1039
00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:10.816
For hours.

1040
00:41:11.686 --> 00:41:13.471
- Did you just type a
couple words on the keyboard

1041
00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:16.561
and find the first thing that
popped up and here we are?

1042
00:41:16.604 --> 00:41:17.866
Oh my God.

1043
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.433
I tried to do one nice
thing for you dude.

1044
00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:21.740
One nice thing for you and
I can't even be appreciated.

1045
00:41:21.783 --> 00:41:22.828
Why would you say that?

1046
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:23.959
Are you gaslighting me?

1047
00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:25.178
I'm being gaslit.

1048
00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:26.309
Oh my god.

1049
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:27.093
I don't even know
what that means.

1050
00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:28.442
So how does it feel?

1051
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:29.356
What?

1052
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.750
Being free from your phone.

1053
00:41:31.793 --> 00:41:32.664
Oh.

1054
00:41:36.798 --> 00:41:37.625
[horn blowing]

1055
00:41:37.669 --> 00:41:38.931
Oh fuck.

1056
00:41:38.974 --> 00:41:40.149
It's fine.

1057
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:43.022
- I am so fucking
sick of you. Sam.

1058
00:41:43.065 --> 00:41:43.979
How many times are we gonna have

1059
00:41:44.023 --> 00:41:45.546
the same fucking conversation?

1060
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.808
No. no. no.

1061
00:41:46.852 --> 00:41:47.766
You don't get to be sick
of my shit. okay?

1062
00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:49.376
'Cause I'm sick of your shit.

1063
00:41:49.419 --> 00:41:51.900
- You know. I haven't seen
my friends in like two weeks?

1064
00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:52.988
- All right. guys. I'm
just gonna break this-

1065
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:54.903
- You also haven't
seen me. Grace.

1066
00:41:54.947 --> 00:41:57.123
I see you every fucking day.

1067
00:41:57.166 --> 00:41:59.299
But you don't see me.

1068
00:41:59.342 --> 00:42:00.126
You're insane.

1069
00:42:00.169 --> 00:42:00.996
You are an insane-

1070
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.520
All right. guys.

1071
00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:03.608
I'm just gonna try to separate
the boat a little bit.

1072
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:04.434
- Clinical depression.
- Oh my god.

1073
00:42:04.478 --> 00:42:05.610
Here we go.

1074
00:42:05.653 --> 00:42:07.046
- Four anxiety disorders
and necrophobia

1075
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:09.004
so yeah. I need some extra
support from my partner.

1076
00:42:09.048 --> 00:42:10.353
Well I have anxiety too.

1077
00:42:10.397 --> 00:42:11.964
I'm just not going
around bragging about it.

1078
00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:12.834
I'm not bragging.

1079
00:42:12.878 --> 00:42:14.096
I'm sharing my affliction.

1080
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.533
It's called being an open book.

1081
00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:17.839
My therapist says to do
it to prevent inner decay.

1082
00:42:17.883 --> 00:42:19.754
- Okay. but when you are
coming up to my father

1083
00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:21.974
the first time you meet him
and you say. "Hi. I'm Sam.

1084
00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:23.279
I have necrophilia."

1085
00:42:23.323 --> 00:42:24.498
- Like don't-
- Oh my God.

1086
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.544
I'm not a necrophiliac.
I'm necrophobic.

1087
00:42:26.587 --> 00:42:27.545
- Well. I'm sorry that
my dad thinks

1088
00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:28.502
you have sex with dead people.

1089
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.459
Oh. don't say dead people.

1090
00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:30.983
- It scares me.
- Oh my God!

1091
00:42:31.026 --> 00:42:34.334
- You never remember to
refill the coffee pot.

1092
00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:35.727
No. what?

1093
00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:39.948
- That's your only refilling
job and it's always empty.

1094
00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:41.907
Yeah!

1095
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:44.257
Well you have dead manners.

1096
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.693
How dare you.

1097
00:42:45.737 --> 00:42:48.914
- Look Sam. you are
crazy. it's contagious.

1098
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:50.132
[fake coughing] Oh. no.

1099
00:42:50.176 --> 00:42:52.744
Everybody. don't catch my crazy.

1100
00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:54.093
- You're screaming
right into my ear.

1101
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.398
You're screaming right
into my ear.

1102
00:42:55.442 --> 00:42:56.878
- Okay. I was trying
to get a point across.

1103
00:42:56.922 --> 00:42:57.836
Because if I don't
raise my volume.

1104
00:42:57.879 --> 00:42:59.272
it's like I don't even exist.

1105
00:42:59.315 --> 00:43:01.056
You buy Jim any bagels.

1106
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.536
- I do?
- Yeah.

1107
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.668
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1108
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:04.756
You're selfish when
you buy bagels

1109
00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:07.802
with the money for our children.

1110
00:43:07.846 --> 00:43:09.108
For our children?

1111
00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:10.544
For our children?

1112
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:12.198
- This is the most riled
up I've seen you in years.

1113
00:43:12.241 --> 00:43:13.416
Oh my god. no.

1114
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.114
I get passionate when
I watch tennis.

1115
00:43:15.157 --> 00:43:16.376
And you know that.

1116
00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:17.812
- You spend all day
in the shower.

1117
00:43:17.856 --> 00:43:20.554
but when you come out.
your hair's dry.

1118
00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:21.947
What am I doing in there?

1119
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.774
I don't know.

1120
00:43:22.817 --> 00:43:25.211
[both laugh]

1121
00:43:26.778 --> 00:43:28.518
Pedal me back in.

1122
00:43:28.562 --> 00:43:33.567
- I will sink this boat before
I do another thing for you.

1123
00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:34.829
I dare you.

1124
00:43:37.702 --> 00:43:38.485
What are you doing?

1125
00:43:38.528 --> 00:43:39.399
You're insane.

1126
00:43:40.269 --> 00:43:41.314
You're insane.

1127
00:43:41.357 --> 00:43:43.142
- Stop.
- I will drown you.

1128
00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:44.143
Oh. okay.

1129
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:46.972
Oh my God.

1130
00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:48.190
Oh my God.

1131
00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:49.931
I will drown you.

1132
00:43:53.935 --> 00:43:55.067
It's enough.

1133
00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.896
Lake water must stand
the lake my guy.

1134
00:43:57.939 --> 00:43:59.724
Super yuck water.

1135
00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:00.725
Super yuck.

1136
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.426
- I'm not standing another
second on this one with you.

1137
00:44:06.469 --> 00:44:11.518
Then leave.

1138
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.008
- You good?
- Yeah.

1139
00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:27.839
- You're probably gonna
wanna shower immediately.

1140
00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:41.200
You like it?

1141
00:44:41.243 --> 00:44:42.201
Yeah.

1142
00:44:42.244 --> 00:44:43.376
I think it's perfect for you.

1143
00:44:43.419 --> 00:44:45.073
- For me?
- For you.

1144
00:44:45.117 --> 00:44:47.728
[playful music]

1145
00:44:55.518 --> 00:44:59.044
[playful music continues]

1146
00:45:12.405 --> 00:45:14.973
So is this where you bring
all your dates that fail?

1147
00:45:21.893 --> 00:45:22.763
No. really.

1148
00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:24.199
Like do you come here a lot?

1149
00:45:24.243 --> 00:45:26.071
No. no. no. no. no.

1150
00:45:26.114 --> 00:45:27.637
I've never been here.

1151
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:28.943
Not once.

1152
00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:30.989
- Just figured you bring
all your dates here.

1153
00:45:31.032 --> 00:45:33.165
No. probably was saving it.

1154
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:34.340
For what?

1155
00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:35.515
For someone damp?

1156
00:45:36.472 --> 00:45:37.735
Yeah. for someone damp.

1157
00:45:41.608 --> 00:45:43.392
- I wouldn't say I'm
not an ocean person

1158
00:45:43.436 --> 00:45:45.264
'cause everyone likes the ocean.

1159
00:45:45.307 --> 00:45:46.439
I mean. probably not everyone.

1160
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:48.180
but like. most people
like the ocean.

1161
00:45:48.223 --> 00:45:52.227
But I just feel like
I personally would rather go to a lake.

1162
00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:54.752
Not to say the lake I
don't. I like this.

1163
00:45:54.795 --> 00:45:55.709
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.

1164
00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:57.276
No. I don't like. not like it.

1165
00:45:57.319 --> 00:45:58.146
Right.

1166
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.017
It's beautiful.

1167
00:46:03.195 --> 00:46:06.198
- You could've made like.
regular merchandise.

1168
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:08.853
- It's way worse for me 'cause
I'm wearing my own merch.

1169
00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:12.334
That's like the most lamest
thing that you can do.

1170
00:46:12.378 --> 00:46:13.596
It's the most lamest?

1171
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.510
Yeah.

1172
00:46:16.382 --> 00:46:17.383
Nah. nobody cares.

1173
00:46:18.819 --> 00:46:20.473
- That woman literally
like looked us

1174
00:46:20.516 --> 00:46:21.953
up and down so aggressively.

1175
00:46:21.996 --> 00:46:24.129
In this instance. you can't
say that nobody cares.

1176
00:46:24.172 --> 00:46:25.739
[both laugh]

1177
00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:27.001
- You saw it.
- I saw it.

1178
00:46:28.524 --> 00:46:30.048
[romantic music]

1179
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:31.005
Cheers by the way.

1180
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.706
- I feel like I still don't
know anything about you.

1181
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.752
we've spent the whole day
together and I don't think

1182
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.927
I know a single thing about you.

1183
00:46:39.971 --> 00:46:41.450
There's not much to know.

1184
00:46:41.494 --> 00:46:42.538
Where are you from?

1185
00:46:42.582 --> 00:46:43.626
Here.

1186
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.453
Right here?

1187
00:46:44.497 --> 00:46:45.541
Yeah. from right here.

1188
00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:46.847
From right on this bench.

1189
00:46:48.066 --> 00:46:50.111
Do you have any siblings?

1190
00:46:50.155 --> 00:46:50.982
No.

1191
00:46:51.025 --> 00:46:51.809
None?

1192
00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:52.635
No. none.

1193
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:53.462
Do you?

1194
00:46:53.506 --> 00:46:54.376
I have a brother.

1195
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.987
I have a younger brother.

1196
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.814
Is he cool?

1197
00:46:56.857 --> 00:46:58.119
He's young.

1198
00:46:58.163 --> 00:46:59.120
- He's. yeah. yeah.
yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1199
00:46:59.164 --> 00:47:01.296
Are you close with your mom?

1200
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.732
My mom.

1201
00:47:02.776 --> 00:47:04.169
Oh. sorry.

1202
00:47:04.212 --> 00:47:05.953
It's the woman who birthed you.

1203
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:07.433
Oh. that's what that is.

1204
00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:08.608
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1205
00:47:12.307 --> 00:47:15.702
- Do you have any
hopes and dreams?

1206
00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:16.616
- Are you writing
a book about me?

1207
00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:17.922
No. but do you?

1208
00:47:17.965 --> 00:47:19.880
- If you are. I need
to give consent.

1209
00:47:19.924 --> 00:47:21.534
There's lawyers involved.

1210
00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:22.752
If you're already writing.

1211
00:47:22.796 --> 00:47:23.797
- Do you have any
hopes and dreams?

1212
00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.451
I'm just saying.

1213
00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:26.321
if you're writing a book about
me. I need to know about it.

1214
00:47:26.365 --> 00:47:27.540
I need to sign some forms.

1215
00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:28.323
- Are you gonna work
on boats forever?

1216
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.629
I don't know. maybe.

1217
00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:30.630
So that brings me back.

1218
00:47:30.673 --> 00:47:32.066
Do you have hopes and dreams?

1219
00:47:33.502 --> 00:47:34.329
Do you?

1220
00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:35.765
I don't know. Callie.

1221
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:36.418
What kind of hopes and
dreams should a man have?

1222
00:47:36.462 --> 00:47:37.942
I don't know.

1223
00:47:38.116 --> 00:47:42.468
Woodworking. free soloing.
accounting. sailing. running.

1224
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:44.774
Maybe accounting.

1225
00:47:44.818 --> 00:47:47.473
- Accounting?
- Yeah. accounting.

1226
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.083
Is that hot?

1227
00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:50.737
That's really hot.

1228
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.305
I'm actually really hot by that.

1229
00:47:53.348 --> 00:47:55.350
You need two accountants?

1230
00:47:59.311 --> 00:48:02.053
- In my spare time.
- Oh yeah?

1231
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:07.014
- I paint bad paintings
with cheap watercolors.

1232
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:10.235
That's actually kinda cool.

1233
00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:12.890
- So now you would say
something about you.

1234
00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:14.065
Why are you so obsessed

1235
00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:15.501
with what other people
think about you?

1236
00:48:15.544 --> 00:48:17.198
No. that's about me.

1237
00:48:17.242 --> 00:48:18.330
I'm serious.

1238
00:48:18.373 --> 00:48:19.461
Why are you so obsessed
with what?

1239
00:48:19.505 --> 00:48:20.723
- Why can't you talk
about yourself?

1240
00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:21.768
I'm just not that interesting.

1241
00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:23.770
- Say one thing.
- One thing.

1242
00:48:23.813 --> 00:48:24.771
- You can't do it.
- I can.

1243
00:48:24.814 --> 00:48:25.641
Yes. I can.

1244
00:48:25.685 --> 00:48:26.425
You really can't do it.

1245
00:48:26.468 --> 00:48:27.817
No. I can do it.

1246
00:48:27.861 --> 00:48:29.907
- I like to draw.
- Okay.

1247
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.560
I enjoy drawing.

1248
00:48:31.604 --> 00:48:32.822
Okay.

1249
00:48:32.866 --> 00:48:34.085
- With pencils. not
with watercolors.

1250
00:48:34.172 --> 00:48:36.130
- Right. because then
it would be painting.

1251
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.352
Right.

1252
00:48:40.395 --> 00:48:41.353
God. you're smart.

1253
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:44.747
- I think I'm gonna
title the book.

1254
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:47.881
"Not That Interesting.
Don't Read This Book."

1255
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:48.926
That's my book?

1256
00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:50.362
- The book about me?
- Yeah.

1257
00:48:50.405 --> 00:48:51.450
And then the first chapter.

1258
00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:52.538
the first chapter will just say.

1259
00:48:52.581 --> 00:48:54.932
unless you like to
draw sometimes.

1260
00:48:54.975 --> 00:48:57.586
[gentle music]

Are you cold?

No. I'm okay.

No. I'm okay.

1265
00:49:05.072 --> 00:49:06.726
I understand you're
trying to be a gentleman

1266
00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:08.554
but I actually don't need a man.

1267
00:49:08.597 --> 00:49:09.947
You don't need a man?

1268
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.600
- Yeah. 'cause I'm really
self-sufficient.

1269

You're an independent woman.

- Yeah.

You can like pay monthly

to you an app?

1289
00:49:39.628 --> 00:49:44.111
- Like a job application?
- No. like application.

I don't know what it
means. [laughs]

My phoneless day with
the boat guy.

1292

Spoiler. it wasn't terrible.

1293
00:49:55.949 --> 00:49:57.472

little thing.

your car. checking the time.

1295
00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:02.303
Oh. and another red flag
is he's completely afraid

1296

Typical cis man can't
show emotion.

1299
00:50:07.265 --> 00:50:09.615

some kinda trauma.

1300

I mean. we all do.

1301
00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:11.921
Everyone does. and that's okay.

1302
00:50:11.965 --> 00:50:13.401
And you have to confront
it and move past it.

1303
00:50:13.445 --> 00:50:15.012
But with Leo. it's like
something happens in his head.

1304
00:50:15.055 --> 00:50:19.320
Anytime I say anything serious
and he just avoids reality

1305
00:50:19.364 --> 00:50:21.627
and he starts talking
about absolute nonsense.

1306
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.151
And I know I say it
over and over.

1307

One red flag is too
many red flags.

1308

And we literally have
nothing in common.

1309

But we laugh a lot.

1313
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.519

and make out with that chick?

1618
01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:58.704
I didn't-

1619
01:03:58.747 --> 01:03:59.531
Come on.

1620
01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:00.358
I knew this wasn't real.

1621
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:01.228
It was my sister.

1622
01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:02.316
She was all in my head

1623
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.143
like. "Oh. he's real.

1624
01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.362
He's perfect.

1625
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:05.363
You deserve this."

1626
01:04:05.406 --> 01:04:07.104
But you're not.

1627
01:04:07.147 --> 01:04:10.150
You just don't breed dogs and
sell coke like my fucking ex.

1628
01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:11.935
Whatever. Leo.

1629
01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:12.936
You know what?

1630
01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:14.676
You. you are no better.

1631
01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.200
Good luck with him.

1632
01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:17.984
Good fucking luck with him.

1633
01:04:18.028 --> 01:04:21.205
I hope you two enjoy
having sex together.

1634
01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:25.426
Fucking hey. [groans]

1635
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:26.775
Mythic blend.

1636
01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:30.823
That's the line from
the restaurant.

1637
01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:34.479
- There are still other
restaurants.

1638
01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:37.134
[somber music]

1639
01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:47.579
So...

1640
01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:54.281
So how many girls exactly
are you seeing right now?

1641
01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.414
Callie. it's not like that.

1642
01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:59.939
- Look. I mean. we never
said we were exclusive.

1643
01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.854
I just assumed.

1644
01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.203
How do you even have time?

1645
01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:08.730
- I was seeing a couple
people before.

1646
01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:10.645
but none of it was serious.

1647
01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:16.477
- Yeah. I mean. I have people
I'm hooking up with too.

1648
01:05:17.696 --> 01:05:19.045
None of them would do that.

1649
01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:25.486
- Yeah. she might have read
into things a little too much.

1650
01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:36.454
Hey. wait.

1651
01:05:36.497 --> 01:05:37.716
Wait. wait. wait.

1652
01:05:37.759 --> 01:05:39.370
Where you going?

1653
01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:41.067
- I think I should go before
I read into things too much.

1654
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:41.938
No. Callie.

1655
01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.505
Callie. that's not what I...

1656
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:45.724
Wait a second.

1657
01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:47.726
I'm not trying to hurt
anybody here.

1658
01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:49.858
- Leo. I've been with
guys like you before.

1659
01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:52.861
You're gonna say whatever
you need to say to trick me

1660
01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:54.037
to catch feelings and that I'm-

1661
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.473
I'm not trying to trick you.

1662
01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:56.778
I wasn't trying to trick Mina.

1663
01:05:56.822 --> 01:05:58.955
I'm just saying that
like in the moment.

1664
01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:00.913
can't some things just be real?

1665
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.480
Can't it just exist
when it exists?

1666
01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:04.743
Can't some things just
be a beautiful memory?

1667
01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:06.527
Yeah. that's really deep.

1668
01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:09.704
So what?

1669
01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:13.360
In the moment you're all in and
then outta sight outta mind?

1670
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:14.361
No.

1671
01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.449
You know. there's actually.

1672
01:06:15.493 --> 01:06:16.276
there's a name for
guys like you.

1673
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.495
What?

1674
01:06:17.538 --> 01:06:18.583
Fuck boys.

1675
01:06:21.238 --> 01:06:23.762
- Just wait. just wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1676
01:06:23.805 --> 01:06:24.937
Don't leave yet.

1677
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.460
Leo. what the fuck?

1678
01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:27.331
Don't leave.

1679
01:06:27.374 --> 01:06:28.680
Just don't leave yet.

1680
01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:30.638
Hey. you can still jump back.

1681
01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:31.726
You're kidnapping me?

1682
01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:32.901
- No. I just-

1683
01:06:32.945 --> 01:06:33.728
- Oh. you're finally
gonna murder me?

1684
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.382
I could tie us back up.

1685
01:06:35.426 --> 01:06:37.167
Or you can come for a ride.

1686
01:06:43.434 --> 01:06:44.304
Seriously?

1687
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:51.311
Please.

1688
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.018
- I was starting to think that
this wasn't even a real boat.

1689
01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:06.587
[gentle music]

1690
01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:17.903
[gentle music continues]

1691
01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:28.000
[gentle music continues]

1692
01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:37.749
[gentle music continues]

1693
01:07:44.277 --> 01:07:47.715
[gentle music continues]

1694
01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:57.725
[gentle music continues]

1695
01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:05.255
[gentle music continues]

1696
01:08:05.298 --> 01:08:08.736
[gentle music continues]

1697
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.528
[gentle music continues]

1698
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.625
[gentle music continues]

1699
01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:37.461
On the way out to Catalina.

1700
01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:38.940
It's pretty. huh?

1701
01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:41.769
Yeah.

1702
01:08:47.384 --> 01:08:50.213
- Yeah. this is kind
of the only place I...

1703
01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.476
I don't know. where
I can get clear.

1704
01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:56.480
The city. everything just
gets so blurry. you know?

1705
01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:00.832
Yeah. it's nice.

1706
01:09:05.837 --> 01:09:07.578
So what happened?

1707
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:12.017
- With Mina?
- No. not with Mina.

1708
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.105
I mean. you.

1709
01:09:16.282 --> 01:09:18.632
Why come out here to
be a sad moody boy?

1710
01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:23.289
I mean. you don't
have to tell me.

1711
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:25.683
but you did just kidnap me.

1712
01:09:34.605 --> 01:09:39.000
- I got out of a
relationship kind of recently

1713
01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:43.353
and it messed me up
a little bit so.

1714
01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:46.660
How recently?

1715
01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:48.706
Like three years.

1716
01:09:51.665 --> 01:09:52.623
Okay.

1717
01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:57.149
Three years is not just getting
out of her relationship.

1718
01:09:58.019 --> 01:10:01.762
Leo. three years. it's
such a long time.

1719
01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:02.676
I know. I know.

1720
01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:06.202
That's stupid.

1721
01:10:09.901 --> 01:10:10.858
Just time flew.

1722
01:10:13.252 --> 01:10:14.122
You loved her?

1723
01:10:21.695 --> 01:10:22.914
Yeah. I did.

1724
01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:27.310
You still love her.

1725
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:30.661
No.

1726
01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:33.446
I don't know.

1727
01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:36.580
I don't think so.

1728
01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:38.712
- You know. I've never
really understood

1729
01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:41.585
the attraction to sad boys.

1730
01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:45.328
All these girls. they're
gonna go save these sad boys

1731
01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:47.068
and nurse them back to health.

1732
01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.333
It's just never really
been my thing.

1733
01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:54.380
How's this?

1734
01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:56.600
That's much better.

1735
01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:58.123
This is good.

1736
01:10:58.166 --> 01:11:00.778
[both chuckling]

1737
01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:01.692
Yeah.

1738
01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:11.484
What time is it?

1739
01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:12.311
I don't know.

1740
01:11:12.355 --> 01:11:13.921
Where's your phone?

1741
01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:15.140
Somewhere.

1742
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.363
What?

1743
01:11:20.406 --> 01:11:21.625
- Stop.
- What?

1744
01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:22.669
Whoa. are you serious?

1745
01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:24.280
I don't have it.

1746
01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:28.849
- You don't have it?
- I don't have it.

1747
01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:32.244
- Your 100.000 friends must
be so worried about you.

1748
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.811
2.1 million.

1749
01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:39.947
- It's been like two
hours since you checked.

1750
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:40.992
You know. they probably are.

1751
01:11:41.035 --> 01:11:42.080
Worried about you?

1752
01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:43.081
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1753
01:11:43.124 --> 01:11:44.996
I mean. my mom for sure is.

1754
01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:47.259
I had like two anxiety attacks
and she constantly thinks

1755
01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.826
I'm gonna jump off a building.

1756
01:11:53.134 --> 01:11:54.135
Are you serious?

1757
01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:55.223
It's fine.

1758
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.793
- How you never told me that
you have anxiety attacks?

1759
01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:01.969
I mean. who doesn't?

1760
01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:06.539
- If you ever wanna
talk about it.

1761
01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.498
Yeah. let's talk about it.

1762
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.369
Let's get like really
deep into it.

1763
01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:11.979
Okay. all right.

1764
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:14.330
I'm serious.

1765
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.382
But hey. you can tell those
people who are worried about you

1766
01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:28.387
that you had a real nice
human connection. interaction.

1767
01:12:29.997 --> 01:12:31.434
Yeah. this has been

1768
01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:36.090
such an amazing connection.
interaction.

1769
01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:37.788
I'm having a great time.

1770
01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:39.920
I'm sorry about tonight.

1771
01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:41.226
That was dramatic.

1772
01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:44.229
- That was nice of her
to bring us wine.

1773
01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:45.839
Yeah.

1774
01:12:45.883 --> 01:12:48.755
Yeah. I didn't appreciate the
delivery system. but yeah.

1775
01:12:48.799 --> 01:12:49.974
She's polite.

1776
01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:51.845
[Leo chuckles]

1777
01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:52.759
I like her.

1778
01:12:53.586 --> 01:12:56.197
[gentle music]

1779
01:13:04.292 --> 01:13:07.731
[gentle music continues]

1780
01:13:14.738 --> 01:13:18.263
[gentle music continues]

1781
01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:30.841
Hi.

1782
01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:32.451
Hey.

1783
01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:33.757
You didn't wake me up.

1784
01:13:34.714 --> 01:13:36.716
- I know better than
to wake a woman up.

1785
01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:42.809
Chin up.

1786
01:13:48.293 --> 01:13:49.468
It's to remember me by.

1787
01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:52.515
Wow.

1788
01:13:56.388 --> 01:13:58.216
Wait. that doesn't make sense

1789
01:13:58.259 --> 01:13:59.870
'cause this is a drawing of me.

1790
01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:02.263
So that would make
me remember me.

1791
01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.310
I think you should have it.

1792
01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:06.224
You keep it.

1793
01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:08.095
Here.

1794
01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:15.625
For you to remember me by as
I sail off into the night.

1795
01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:18.149
never to be seen again.

1796
01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:21.892
Shit.

1797
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.203
What do you doing right now?

1798
01:14:31.205 --> 01:14:33.556
What did you have in mind?

1799
01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:34.513
It's a surprise.

1800
01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:40.911
[playful music]

1801
01:14:44.828 --> 01:14:46.743
So. Leo. right?

1802
01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:47.744
Yeah.

1803
01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:49.223
And your Callie's partner or?

1804
01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:50.529
It's undefined.

1805
01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:52.313
Very cute. undefined.

1806
01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:54.446
All right. I'll just say it.

1807
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.056
Callie. why did you bring
this random guy

1808
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.362
to our family therapy?

1809
01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:58.450
I mean. no offense. bro.

1810
01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.582
We are not all thinking that.

1811
01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:00.974
We are not thinking that.

1812
01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:01.888
No I was.

1813
01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:03.977
Yeah.

1814
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.458
- It was very nice
to meet you family

1815
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.286
at your family therapy.

1816
01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:09.417
I'll just wait outside.

1817
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:10.767
- Nice meeting you.
- No. no. no.

1818
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:13.291
The problem is Leo's
having a really hard time

1819
01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:16.381
getting over a breakup
that was three years ago.

1820
01:15:16.424 --> 01:15:17.730
So I thought it could
be really good for him

1821
01:15:17.774 --> 01:15:18.644
to come talk about it.

1822
01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:20.298
No. I don't think that.

1823
01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:21.647
- Well also. it could be
beneficial for the rest of us

1824
01:15:21.691 --> 01:15:23.780
to listen and start to
recognize the difference

1825
01:15:23.823 --> 01:15:25.608
between like a romantic breakup

1826
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:27.610
and your daughter moving
into an apartment.

1827
01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.655
- But the difference is
it's more painful. Margaret.

1828
01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:31.657
Let's try not to compare.
but sure.

1829
01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.007
Sometimes. listening to someone
else's emotional journey

1830
01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:35.966
can help us self-reflect.

1831
01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:37.315
I just don't think this-

1832
01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:38.316
- She broke his heart
and now he sleeps around

1833
01:15:38.359 --> 01:15:39.926
to fill the void that she left.

1834
01:15:41.058 --> 01:15:41.841
I don't sleep around.

1835
01:15:41.885 --> 01:15:42.668
That's. that's...

1836
01:15:42.712 --> 01:15:43.582
I don't. that's...

1837
01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:46.977
- Can't make a wife
out of a hoe. bro.

1838
01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.631
She's for the streets now.

1839
01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:50.371
It's time to hop back
on that choo choo train.

1840
01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:51.329
You feel me?

1841
01:15:51.372 --> 01:15:53.070
Why you talk like that?

1842
01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:54.550
Like what?

1843
01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:57.553
- Wait. so is Callie the
choo choo train in that?

1844
01:15:57.596 --> 01:15:58.858
Come on. please.

1845
01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:02.166
- And she was actually
a really great woman

1846
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:03.994
and she was one of the best
people I've ever met. so.

1847
01:16:04.037 --> 01:16:05.386
Was?

1848
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.866
Are you dating this guy?

1849
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:08.302
Oh my god.

1850
01:16:08.346 --> 01:16:09.869
She like dead or something?

1851
01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:11.958
- What?
- Oh no.

1852
01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:13.699
Is she?

1853
01:16:13.743 --> 01:16:16.223
- I take back the stuff about
her being a hoe if she's dead.

1854
01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:18.008
Yeah. that was bad.

1855
01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:21.141
Okay.

1856
01:16:21.185 --> 01:16:21.968
It was nice to meet you.

1857
01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:22.926
Leo. I...

1858
01:16:23.796 --> 01:16:24.623
Wait.

1859
01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.190
So like. how did she die?

1860
01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:29.106
- Callie. I don't know if a
guy with a dead girlfriend

1861
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:30.455
is a good choice.

1862
01:16:30.498 --> 01:16:31.587
I might have to agree.

1863
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.023
- He doesn't have a
dead girlfriend.

1864
01:16:33.066 --> 01:16:34.415
- Let's reel this
back in. Callie.

1865
01:16:34.459 --> 01:16:36.156
- He sure seemed nice.
- Yeah.

1866
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.245
Seriously. Dan?

1867
01:16:38.289 --> 01:16:39.551
he killed someone.

1868
01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:40.987
No. he did not.

1869
01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.119
He's not a murderer.

1870
01:16:42.162 --> 01:16:43.642
- Can we please get
back to here?

1871
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.253
Was that really bad?

1872
01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.473
It wasn't good.

1873
01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:54.610
I don't know.

1874
01:16:56.829 --> 01:16:59.266
I mean. can I be with someone

1875
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.442
who's not emotionally available?

1876
01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:02.618
Probably not.

1877
01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:05.795
Do I wanna try?

1878
01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:08.754
Yes.

1879
01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:12.758
I guess that's my toxic trait.

1880
01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:17.023
[gentle music]

1881
01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:27.686
[gentle music continues]

1882
01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:35.912
So now I'm going down.

1883
01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:44.311
Oh. hey. Callie girl.

1884
01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:45.748
Hey. guys.

1885
01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.793
Sorry. this is probably
a bad time.

1886
01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:49.012
Oh. no.

1887
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:49.839
No. no. no. no. no.

1888
01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:51.754
Get your butt in here.

1889
01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.494
Okay. [chuckles]

1890
01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:54.539
Thank you.

1891
01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:57.585
We got a seat right here.

1892
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:59.022
No. it's okay.

1893
01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:00.153
- No. I sit down right here.
- No. I don't think-

1894
01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:00.980
- I got a drink for
you right here.

1895
01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:02.025
It's okay.

1896
01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:02.852
No. take the drink.

1897
01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:03.940
Take the drink.

1898
01:18:03.983 --> 01:18:04.941
Leo. get a drink.

1899
01:18:04.984 --> 01:18:06.769
And this is Tim.

1900
01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:08.118
This is Bud.

1901
01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:09.336
- Hi.
- Hey.

1902
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.250
I'm Dusty.

1903
01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:11.121
You're Dusty.

1904
01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:12.731
And this is Leo.

1905
01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:14.254
I've heard about him.

1906
01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:15.212
You know something?

1907
01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:16.648
For as long as we've known Leo.

1908
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.998
I don't think that we
have ever been introduced

1909
01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:21.435
to any of his lady friends
on his boat.

1910
01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:23.002
Oh.

1911
01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:24.612
Oh. I'm honored.

1912
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:27.050
That's a big honor. right?

1913
01:18:28.138 --> 01:18:31.010
No. I mean. like ever.

1914
01:18:31.054 --> 01:18:32.446
I mean of all...

1915
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:36.189
- Oh. all the women.
- No. that's...

1916
01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:37.060
No. I think you should.

1917
01:18:37.103 --> 01:18:38.148
I wanna hear it.

1918
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:41.978
What is it?

1919
01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:47.679
To remember me by.

1920
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:51.509
You don't have to.

1921
01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:52.423
Yeah. yeah. oh.

1922
01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:56.993
Is that?

1923
01:18:57.036 --> 01:18:58.298
I never said I was good.

1924
01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:00.170
Is this me?

1925
01:19:00.213 --> 01:19:01.040
Yeah.

1926
01:19:01.084 --> 01:19:02.302
I mean. obviously.

1927
01:19:02.346 --> 01:19:04.174
Yeah. obviously.

1928
01:19:04.217 --> 01:19:05.088
Yeah. it's my boat.

1929
01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:07.133
Wow. it's terrible.

1930
01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:07.960
Yeah. I know.

1931
01:19:08.004 --> 01:19:12.399
I love it. [chuckles]

1932
01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:13.444
I love it.

1933

[gentle music]

1934
01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:21.757

My therapy.

1936
01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:33.116
Salute.

1937
01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:34.682

Callie.

1942
01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:09.282
I'm peeing.

1943
01:20:09.326 --> 01:20:10.196
I'm so sorry.

1944
01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.763
Yeah. I was just peeing.

1945
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.852
- I know but like. I thought
that that would be funny.

1946
01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:15.941
I thought it'd be payback for
the other night or something.

1947
01:20:15.985 --> 01:20:16.986
Really. I was just peeing.

1948
01:20:17.029 --> 01:20:18.465
It was such a fucked up idea.

1949
01:20:18.509 --> 01:20:21.599
- It was. and I'd never
wanna see your family again.

1950
01:20:21.642 --> 01:20:22.818
Me either.

1951
01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.820
I don't ever wanna see
my family again.

1952
01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:25.733
You wanna make out with me?

1953
01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.387
I wanna do that so bad.

1954
01:20:27.431 --> 01:20:28.954
All right. let's do that.

1955
01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:31.609

[birds chirping]

1964
01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:41.260
I'm unwell.

1965
01:22:42.827 --> 01:22:44.307
You should go to rehab.

1966
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:45.743
Don't say that.

1967
01:22:45.786 --> 01:22:48.093
That's really offensive
to people who go to rehab.

1968
01:22:48.137 --> 01:22:49.355
- It's offensive?
- Yeah.

1969
01:22:50.748 --> 01:22:53.098
- Okay. well. I'll
apologize to them later.

1970
01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:55.492
Hey. hell of a performance
last night.

1971
01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:58.669
I remember nothing.

1972
01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:01.846
Why don't I do that?

1973
01:23:01.889 --> 01:23:03.108
You wanna scrub it?

1974
01:23:03.152 --> 01:23:03.935
Yeah.

1975
01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.154
You wanna scrub it?

1976
01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:06.155
- I know you do. earn
my keep around.

1977
01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.025
Brush side.

1978
01:23:07.069 --> 01:23:07.808
It is the brush side down.

1979
01:23:07.852 --> 01:23:08.679
Oh.

1980
01:23:08.722 --> 01:23:10.072
And dip it in the water.

1981
01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:10.898
The good water. the clean water.

1982
01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:12.074
Not the-

1983
01:23:12.117 --> 01:23:12.857
- This is like so much
more complicated

1984
01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.076
than you made it sound.

1985
01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:15.512
- It's very simple.
It's very simple.

1986
01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:17.514
- We're not going that
far out into the ocean.

1987
01:23:17.557 --> 01:23:19.211
It doesn't matter.

1988
01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:20.386
I'm still gonna throw up.

1989
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.561
- I don't think you're
gonna throw up

1990
01:23:21.605 --> 01:23:23.520
that's being a little dramatic.

1991
01:23:23.563 --> 01:23:25.957
Wait. are you Callie Girl?

1992
01:23:27.219 --> 01:23:28.568
Yeah.

1993
01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:29.526
Hi.

1994
01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:30.831
Wait. this is so crazy.

1995
01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:32.311
I watch all of your stuff.

1996
01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:33.269
I like. love you.

1997
01:23:33.312 --> 01:23:34.400
Oh my God. Thank you.

1998
01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:35.314
That's really nice.

1999
01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:37.099
I follow her on Instagram.

2000
01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:38.622
Real life influencer.

2001
01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:42.278
Shit. this is boat guy?

2002
01:23:43.366 --> 01:23:44.889
Boat guy.

2003
01:23:44.932 --> 01:23:45.716
You talking about me?

2004
01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:46.630
I'm boat guy?

2005
01:23:47.631 --> 01:23:49.067
Yeah. thank you so much.

2006
01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:51.069
I really appreciate you.

2007
01:23:51.113 --> 01:23:52.027
Thanks for that.

2008
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.767
I'm so sorry for your loss.

2009
01:23:54.899 --> 01:23:55.769
My loss?

2010
01:23:57.858 --> 01:23:59.034
Actually...

2011
01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:00.035
Actually. do you mind
if I just take.

2012
01:24:00.078 --> 01:24:01.862
I haven't seen it before.

2013
01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.517
I haven't seen it.

2014
01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.258
- I feel like I might have
kinda like. screw this up?

2015
01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:07.216
No. no.

2016
01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:08.608
I just haven't seen it before.

2017
01:24:08.652 --> 01:24:09.522
Okay.

2018
01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:11.046
Yeah. this is the new one.

2019
01:24:11.089 --> 01:24:12.003
Oh. okay.

2020
01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:15.006
- In the boat bathroom.
you flush with your foot.

2021
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.355
Look.

2022
01:24:16.399 --> 01:24:18.401
[cheering] Science.

2023
01:24:18.444 --> 01:24:19.880
Okay.

2024
01:24:19.924 --> 01:24:21.143
You're welcome for
showing you that.

2025
01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.971
I'm pretty sure I'm like
a major asshole

2026
01:24:24.015 --> 01:24:26.800
'cause I think his ex is dead.

2027
01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:31.327
which makes me like such
a shitty person. right?

2028
01:24:38.247 --> 01:24:39.291
Thanks.

2029
01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:40.597
- Sure.
- Yeah.

2030
01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.554
Okay.

2031
01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:42.381
Bye.

2032
01:24:42.425 --> 01:24:43.382
Sorry.

2033
01:24:43.426 --> 01:24:45.428
It's really nice to meet you.

2034
01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:46.385
Sorry.

2035
01:24:50.737 --> 01:24:51.738
I was really drunk.

2036
01:24:51.782 --> 01:24:53.131
And that was way outta context

2037
01:24:53.175 --> 01:24:54.524
because I said a lot
of stuff after that.

2038
01:24:54.567 --> 01:24:57.092
I actually said that I was
gonna stop filming you.

2039
01:24:58.789 --> 01:25:00.007
Yeah. what was that?

2040
01:25:00.051 --> 01:25:02.053
- Yeah. just watch
the ones before

2041
01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.663
because it'll make
way more sense.

2042
01:25:03.707 --> 01:25:05.752
I mean. what was it though?

2043
01:25:05.796 --> 01:25:07.667
You're like. documenting me or?

2044
01:25:07.711 --> 01:25:10.975
No. I'm not documenting you.

2045
01:25:11.018 --> 01:25:12.629
I just...

2046
01:25:12.672 --> 01:25:14.326
I thought that we said that
we were gonna be real. Callie.

2047
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.197
Yeah. we are.

2048
01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:19.244
You know. it's my fault

2049
01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:21.116
'cause I know that this
is what you do

2050
01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:23.857
and I shouldn't known better.

2051
01:25:23.901 --> 01:25:25.032
Right?

2052
01:25:25.076 --> 01:25:26.077
Leo.

2053
01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:26.904
Leo. come on.

2054
01:25:26.947 --> 01:25:28.427
No. no.

2055
01:25:28.471 --> 01:25:31.648
Seriously. I just think
that you should probably go.

2056
01:25:33.084 --> 01:25:34.520
Can we talk about it?

2057
01:25:34.564 --> 01:25:35.695
- I mean. I don't know what
we're gonna talk about.

2058
01:25:35.739 --> 01:25:37.436
Callie. you said that
my ex is dead.

2059
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.698
You're just like making
up stories.

2060
01:25:38.742 --> 01:25:40.004
She lives in the valley.

2061
01:25:40.047 --> 01:25:41.179
The valley?

2062
01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:42.963
Why do you have a
box of her stuff?

2063
01:25:43.007 --> 01:25:44.226
She just moved to the valley?

2064
01:25:44.269 --> 01:25:45.488
You went do my stuff?

2065
01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:46.793
- You have a hospital
bracelet in there.

2066
01:25:46.837 --> 01:25:50.188
So I thought. like Bella
said it and then I-

2067
01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:51.450
- How are you going
through my stuff?

2068
01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:52.886
- No. I'm not like going
through your stuff.

2069
01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:54.888
You should keep toilet
paper next to your toilet

2070
01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:56.325
so people don't have to
open your cabinet.

2071
01:25:56.368 --> 01:25:57.413
- Yeah. Callie. I know
where toilet paper goes.

2072
01:25:57.456 --> 01:25:58.631
Why did you go through my stuff?

2073
01:25:58.675 --> 01:26:00.198
- Why do you have a
hospital bracelet?

2074
01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:01.547
- Because maybe I gave
her an edible

2075
01:26:01.591 --> 01:26:03.114
when she got really high
and I had to take her

2076
01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.246
to the hospital because she
thought she was gonna die

2077
01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:05.247
but everything was fine.

2078
01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:06.509
It was a really nice memory

2079
01:26:06.552 --> 01:26:07.727
and I wanted to just keep
it just private.

2080
01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:08.467
'Cause that's where
private things go.

2081
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.729
Leo. that's weird.

2082
01:26:09.773 --> 01:26:11.122
It's so weird you
still have that.

2083
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.428
It's weird that you
have her stuff.

2084
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:13.472
Yeah. okay. It's weird.

2085
01:26:13.516 --> 01:26:14.865
So I'm just a big weirdo. okay.

2086
01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:15.909
So you're just gonna
capture the weirdos stuff

2087
01:26:15.953 --> 01:26:17.607
and put it on your talk ticker.

2088
01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:19.304
and you're just gonna put
it out to the internet

2089
01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:21.306
and you're just gonna expose
the weirdo's life. right?

2090
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:22.786
You're gonna expose it to
your whole internet friends?

2091
01:26:22.829 --> 01:26:24.440
How could I expose you?

2092
01:26:24.483 --> 01:26:26.093
I know nothing about you.

2093
01:26:26.137 --> 01:26:27.399
I mean clearly. you won't tell
me anything about yourself.

2094
01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:28.574
Well this is why. Callie.

2095
01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:29.836
Why?

2096
01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.490
Because now I know something
about you?

2097
01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:32.883
Why is that such a bad thing
if people even know about you?

2098
01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:34.493
'Cause it's not up to you.

2099
01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:36.669
'Cause it's not your
story to tell. Callie.

2100
01:26:37.627 --> 01:26:39.194
I fucked up.

2101
01:26:39.237 --> 01:26:40.195
Callie. I used...

2102
01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:42.458
I was not a very good guy.

2103
01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:45.983
But I thought I could
be a good guy with you.

2104
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.116
And I see now that that's
not possible

2105
01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.510
because Callie. you're
really fucking self-centered

2106
01:26:51.554 --> 01:26:53.469
and everybody just plays
this tiny little role

2107
01:26:53.512 --> 01:26:54.905
in your little story. right?

2108
01:26:58.082 --> 01:27:01.128
You're one to talk. Leo.

2109
01:27:01.172 --> 01:27:03.261
Look. I know your game.

2110
01:27:03.305 --> 01:27:05.481
You bring women here to
give them. what was it?

2111
01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:06.917
Memories?

2112
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.919
A little fantasy? Romance?

2113
01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:11.138
Don't act like that's
not what this is.

2114
01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.183
I'm not really here.

2115
01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:15.317
I'm not really in your world
'cause you won't let me in.

2116
01:27:16.535 --> 01:27:18.145
- This is exactly what
I'm talking about. Callie.

2117
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:21.105
Everybody just exists inside
your little privilege bubble.

2118
01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:24.151
They don't matter unless they
are in your little story.

2119
01:27:24.195 --> 01:27:25.109
You just do everything. what?

2120
01:27:25.152 --> 01:27:26.066
To be like by total strangers?

2121
01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:27.416
I don't need to be liked.

2122
01:27:27.459 --> 01:27:28.591
That's not what this is about.

2123
01:27:28.634 --> 01:27:29.548
- That's exactly what
this is about.

2124
01:27:29.592 --> 01:27:30.810
No. it's not what it's about.

2125
01:27:30.854 --> 01:27:32.334
I'm trying to do something
with my life.

2126
01:27:32.377 --> 01:27:34.466
So yeah. I share personal
details because I have to.

2127
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:35.989
But at least I want
something. Leo.

2128
01:27:36.033 --> 01:27:38.209
I'm not 28 years old
living on a boat.

2129
01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.864
Mourning a breakup that was
three fucking years ago.

2130
01:27:40.907 --> 01:27:42.822
Like. get over it. dude.

2131
01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:47.479
So this is the real Callie.

2132
01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:48.872
It's nice to finally meet you.

2133
01:27:48.915 --> 01:27:49.829
- Can't say the same
'cause I still don't know

2134
01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:51.266
who the fuck you are.

2135
01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:52.876
- That's funny because you
have no problem sharing

2136
01:27:52.919 --> 01:27:54.181
personal details about my life.

2137
01:27:54.225 --> 01:27:55.226
- I shared personal details
about my life.

2138
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.272
You're just in my
life right now.

2139
01:27:57.315 --> 01:27:58.708
So Yeah. I talked about you.

2140
01:27:58.751 --> 01:27:59.578
You're so fake.

2141
01:27:59.622 --> 01:28:00.449
I'm not fake.

2142
01:28:01.319 --> 01:28:02.929
You're fake.

2143
01:28:02.973 --> 01:28:04.453
- Callie. if you're real. then
why don't you show them you?

2144
01:28:04.496 --> 01:28:06.281
You're addicted to your
phone having anxiety attacks

2145
01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:07.543
every day because
you're obsessing

2146
01:28:07.586 --> 01:28:08.631
over other people's lives.

2147
01:28:08.674 --> 01:28:09.806
giving yourself an
anxiety disorder

2148
01:28:09.849 --> 01:28:10.850
Oh. that's my diagnosis?

2149
01:28:10.894 --> 01:28:12.374
Yeah. that's your diagnosis.

2150
01:28:14.637 --> 01:28:16.073
Care more about clout
than you do actual people

2151
01:28:16.116 --> 01:28:17.335
in your life.

2152
01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:18.336
You know the word clout?

2153
01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.163
Yeah. I know the word clout.

2154
01:28:19.206 --> 01:28:20.338
Didn't hip hop.

2155
01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:21.818
Okay. great.

2156
01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:23.167
Well if you're done
enlightening me on everything

2157
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:23.733
that's wrong with me.
I think I'm gonna go.

2158
01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:24.473
No. no. no.

2159
01:28:24.516 --> 01:28:25.387
I asked you to go.

2160
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:26.736
When did you ask me to go?

2161
01:28:26.779 --> 01:28:27.867
You don't listen to me.

2162
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:29.478
Earlier. I told you
you should go.

2163
01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:30.827
I told you to go.

2164
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:32.742
- Well. I'm not gonna
go if you told me to go.

2165
01:28:32.785 --> 01:28:33.612
Well. I did.

2166
01:28:33.656 --> 01:28:34.526
I told you to go.

2167
01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:35.875
I'm not gonna go then

2168
01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:37.877
'cause why would I go
if you tell me to go?

2169
01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:41.185
All right. well. I'm gonna go.

2170
01:28:41.228 --> 01:28:42.099
I'm not leaving.

2171
01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:43.361
That's fine. I'm leaving.

2172
01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:44.362
- Good.
- Good.

2173
01:29:06.863 --> 01:29:07.951
Does it go any faster?

2174
01:29:07.994 --> 01:29:11.563
[Leo yelling indistinctly]

2175
01:29:20.267 --> 01:29:22.879
[somber music]

2176
01:29:30.887 --> 01:29:34.325
[somber music continues]

2177
01:29:49.949 --> 01:29:50.820
Oh. there we go.

2178
01:29:50.863 --> 01:29:52.082
I wanna look popular.

2179
01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:53.170
You are popular.

2180
01:29:53.213 --> 01:29:54.563
No. I wanna look popular.

2181
01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:55.477
Look up.

2182
01:29:59.785 --> 01:30:02.353
[Callie screaming]

2183
01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:03.223
Callie?

2184
01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:06.618
What do you need from
us right now?

2185
01:30:06.662 --> 01:30:07.837
Do you wanna talk about
this meltdown

2186
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.012
or should we just ignore you

2187
01:30:09.055 --> 01:30:10.317
and pretend like it's
not happening?

2188
01:30:10.361 --> 01:30:12.189
- [Callie] Pretend like
it's not happening.

2189
01:30:18.325 --> 01:30:21.067
- Maybe we do video. like I
could do like a little like.

2190
01:30:21.111 --> 01:30:22.895
- If you're done
enlightening me on everything

2191
01:30:22.939 --> 01:30:24.157
that's wrong with me.
I think I'm gonna go.

2192
01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:25.811
No. no. no.

2193
01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:26.812
I asked you to go.

2194
01:30:26.856 --> 01:30:27.857
When did you ask me to go?

2195
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.988
You don't listen to me.

2196
01:30:29.032 --> 01:30:29.685
Earlier. I told you
you should go.

2197
01:30:29.728 --> 01:30:31.034
I told you to go.

2198
01:30:31.077 --> 01:30:31.643
- Well. I'm not gonna
go if you told me to go.

2199
01:30:31.687 --> 01:30:32.601
Well. I did.

2200
01:30:32.644 --> 01:30:33.428
I told you to go.

2201
01:30:33.471 --> 01:30:34.777
I'm not gonna go then

2202
01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.213
'cause why would I go
if you tell me to go?

2203
01:30:36.256 --> 01:30:39.651
All right. well. I'm gonna go.

2204
01:30:39.695 --> 01:30:42.393
[somber music]

2205
01:30:46.658 --> 01:30:49.444
- [Callie] I fucking
hate people!

2206
01:30:56.363 --> 01:30:58.365
I ate a scone I liked.

2207
01:31:01.673 --> 01:31:02.544
Very cool.

2208
01:31:04.415 --> 01:31:05.938
Where was it from?

2209
01:31:05.982 --> 01:31:07.505
It was from Whole Foods.

2210
01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:11.466
- I hear they have a
good baked goods section.

2211
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:15.034
- I got dumped and I'm
getting canceled again.

2212
01:31:15.078 --> 01:31:16.645
So could somebody please
give a shit?

2213
01:31:16.688 --> 01:31:17.776
Oh my God. finally.

2214
01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:18.690
- You literally told
us to pretend

2215
01:31:18.734 --> 01:31:19.735
like nothing was happening.

2216
01:31:20.039 --> 01:31:21.780
- I didn't really have
a scone. I panicked.

2217
01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:26.829
Oh.

2218
01:31:42.671 --> 01:31:43.498
Hey man.

2219
01:31:49.416 --> 01:31:50.505
Oh. shit man.

2220
01:31:50.548 --> 01:31:51.593
I missed another one?

2221
01:31:52.419 --> 01:31:53.899
Yeah. you missed another one.

2222
01:31:56.206 --> 01:31:57.468
I'm sorry. I just...

2223
01:32:03.256 --> 01:32:04.562
You wanna talk about it?

2224
01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:06.608
Talk about what?

2225
01:32:08.827 --> 01:32:10.394
Okay. we won't talk about it.

2226
01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:13.963
Callie coming by tonight?

2227
01:32:15.573 --> 01:32:16.443
Nope.

2228
01:32:19.359 --> 01:32:20.230
What happened?

2229
01:32:25.496 --> 01:32:26.541
You're an idiot.

2230
01:32:28.238 --> 01:32:29.500
I'm an idiot?

2231
01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:30.762
- Yeah. you're an idiot
if you don't know

2232
01:32:30.806 --> 01:32:32.590
that girl's special.

2233
01:32:32.634 --> 01:32:34.113
- Oh. that's why I'm
an idiot. bud.

2234
01:32:34.157 --> 01:32:36.028
because that's exactly
what I thought.

2235
01:32:36.072 --> 01:32:38.074
- I saw the way you
looked at her.

2236
01:32:38.117 --> 01:32:39.510
She's putting on a show.

2237
01:32:39.771 --> 01:32:42.992
- [laughs] So how the hell is
that any different than you?

2238
01:32:45.734 --> 01:32:48.214
Oh. come on. you bring
these women up on our dock.

2239
01:32:48.258 --> 01:32:50.956
on your rose pedaled
boat for a night or two.

2240
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.262
No.

2241
01:32:52.305 --> 01:32:53.132
Isn't that the Leo show?

2242
01:32:53.176 --> 01:32:54.046
It's different.

2243
01:32:56.048 --> 01:32:57.746
- Be an idiot. I'm
fine with that.

2244
01:32:57.789 --> 01:32:59.748
Just don't be a hypocrite.

2245
01:33:01.358 --> 01:33:02.272
You should charged a lot more

2246
01:33:02.315 --> 01:33:03.578
for these therapy sessions. bud.

2247
01:33:03.621 --> 01:33:06.276
You should watch her videos.

2248
01:33:11.977 --> 01:33:13.413
You seen her videos?

2249
01:33:13.457 --> 01:33:14.501
Of course I've seen them.

2250
01:33:14.545 --> 01:33:15.938
My niece is obsessed with her.

2251
01:33:15.981 --> 01:33:17.853
I can't get her to stop
talking about you too.

2252
01:33:17.896 --> 01:33:19.332
How did you?

2253
01:33:19.376 --> 01:33:20.769
So you knew about
this. the whole-

2254
01:33:20.812 --> 01:33:23.119
Just watch the videos.

2255
01:33:23.162 --> 01:33:24.207
I don't have a phone. bud.

2256
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:25.077
I can't.

2257
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:26.644
Well get a damn phone.

2258
01:33:26.688 --> 01:33:28.690
- No. I don't wanna fall
into the same exact trap

2259
01:33:28.733 --> 01:33:29.865
as everybody else.

2260
01:33:29.908 --> 01:33:31.431
Would you cut that bullshit?

2261
01:33:31.475 --> 01:33:32.911
Can you just stop running
from the world?

2262
01:33:32.955 --> 01:33:34.826
- That's exactly what
you guys do.

2263
01:33:35.784 --> 01:33:37.612
You hide out here away
from your family

2264
01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:38.613
and your problems. right?

2265
01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:39.614
[laughs] You're not like us.

2266
01:33:41.224 --> 01:33:43.792
You're too young. Leo.

2267
01:33:44.967 --> 01:33:46.969
We made our choices.

2268
01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:49.362
You got your whole world
in front of you.

2269
01:33:52.061 --> 01:33:52.975
Look at me.

2270
01:33:55.847 --> 01:33:57.544
June is the past.

2271
01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.634
Move on.

2272
01:34:04.856 --> 01:34:06.902
You know. if you are my son-

2273
01:34:06.945 --> 01:34:08.120
- Don't tell me that
I'm an idiot.

2274
01:34:08.164 --> 01:34:11.558
- I'd tell you that
you're a good guy

2275
01:34:12.908 --> 01:34:14.387
without having to try so hard.

2276
01:34:16.302 --> 01:34:18.217
And you gotta start
seeing yourself properly

2277
01:34:18.261 --> 01:34:21.307
because if you don't.
if you don't.

2278
01:34:22.395 --> 01:34:24.310
you're gonna keep missing
everything good

2279
01:34:24.354 --> 01:34:26.399
that's right in front of you.

2280
01:34:34.059 --> 01:34:35.452
And stuff it.

2281
01:34:36.322 --> 01:34:39.674
- She gave me the weirdest
look when I asked about Ryan.

2282
01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:42.111
Suck that belly in long spine.

2283
01:34:42.154 --> 01:34:44.330
Good. Margaret.

2284
01:34:44.374 --> 01:34:46.376
And reverse plank.

2285
01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:47.551
So I can't help but thinking

2286
01:34:47.594 --> 01:34:50.075
he might not be in law
school anymore.

2287
01:34:50.119 --> 01:34:52.034
So sus. bro.

2288
01:34:54.993 --> 01:34:56.473
Suck that belly in. Bella.

2289
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:58.388
Have you heard anything?

2290
01:34:58.431 --> 01:35:00.303
Bella. look at my belly.

2291
01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:01.173
Suck it in like that.

2292
01:35:01.217 --> 01:35:02.131
Your body's shaming me.

2293
01:35:02.174 --> 01:35:03.610
Callie?

2294
01:35:03.654 --> 01:35:04.960
- Callie.
- What?

2295
01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:07.266
- You're not even
listening to me. are you?

2296
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:10.008
- You're literally talking
about nothing.

2297
01:35:10.052 --> 01:35:12.358
- Yeah. I guess my life
is nothing to you.

2298
01:35:12.402 --> 01:35:13.229
You know what?

2299
01:35:13.272 --> 01:35:14.491
This is the problem.

2300
01:35:14.534 --> 01:35:15.971
Okay. whenever we're ready.

2301
01:35:16.014 --> 01:35:16.841
we're gonna make our
way to our feet.

2302
01:35:16.885 --> 01:35:18.277
You're never here.

2303
01:35:18.321 --> 01:35:21.541
I mean. you're here.
but you're not here.

2304
01:35:21.585 --> 01:35:22.499
And you wonder why I'm so anal

2305
01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:24.240
about spending time with you.

2306
01:35:24.283 --> 01:35:25.720
Well. maybe it's because when
I spend time with my daughter.

2307
01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:28.287
she doesn't actually
care to spend it with me.

2308
01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:30.507
Mom. could we skip the drama?

2309
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:40.212
Should we just call it a day?

2310
01:35:40.256 --> 01:35:40.996
Yeah. I think so.

2311
01:35:41.039 --> 01:35:41.910
Okay.

2312
01:35:44.782 --> 01:35:47.132
- Hey. do you think it
was like really that bad?

2313
01:35:49.091 --> 01:35:52.311
- Well. I guess you're
on your phone a lot

2314
01:35:52.355 --> 01:35:54.226
during our sessions.

2315
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:55.880
Yeah.

2316
01:35:55.924 --> 01:35:57.795
- I mean. you barely
do the workouts.

2317
01:35:58.927 --> 01:36:00.189
Like. why are you here?

2318
01:36:02.452 --> 01:36:03.670
Thank you.

2319
01:36:03.714 --> 01:36:04.933
Okay. have a good one.

2320
01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:38.749
Are you mad?

2321
01:36:39.576 --> 01:36:40.795
I'm not mad.

2322
01:36:43.754 --> 01:36:45.408
You just hurt yourself. Callie.

2323
01:36:46.452 --> 01:36:50.805
I mean. you used to be so
excited about everything.

2324
01:36:50.848 --> 01:36:53.242
So engaged and present
and so funny.

2325
01:36:53.285 --> 01:36:54.199
Ugh.

2326
01:36:54.243 --> 01:36:55.635
Now I feel terrible.

2327
01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:56.636
Ugh.

2328
01:36:56.941 --> 01:36:58.638
I can never say the right
thing with you.

2329
01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:03.948
I just mean that you're
not here with me.

2330
01:37:06.298 --> 01:37:08.300
You're always someplace else.

2331
01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:11.738
Yeah. I don't know.

2332
01:37:11.782 --> 01:37:15.438
I guess I feel like I've just...

2333
01:37:15.481 --> 01:37:17.919
I've been like living in a blur.

2334
01:37:17.962 --> 01:37:20.095

should come at home again

2335
01:37:20.138 --> 01:37:21.661
for a while just until
you feel it's okay.

2336
01:37:21.705 --> 01:37:22.749
It's not gonna happen.

2337
01:37:22.793 --> 01:37:23.533
- What if you have
another episode?

2338
01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:24.708
Relentless.

2339
01:37:24.751 --> 01:37:26.275
- So you could just
stay tonight.

2340
01:37:27.232 --> 01:37:28.320
Bella's in my room.

2341
01:37:28.364 --> 01:37:29.669
- I can put her out
on the street.

2342
01:37:29.713 --> 01:37:31.410

her out on the street?

if she called me bro

one more time.

2346
01:37:39.723 --> 01:37:40.942

- This is mad sauce.
bro. no cap.

2360
01:38:07.098 --> 01:38:10.362
No cap on God.

2361
01:38:10.406 --> 01:38:11.363
What does that even mean?

2362
01:38:11.407 --> 01:38:12.234
I don't know.

2363
01:38:12.277 --> 01:38:13.365

He's nice and he's kind.

2371
01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:43.569
but he could totally
fight in a medieval war.

2372
01:38:43.613 --> 01:38:45.267
