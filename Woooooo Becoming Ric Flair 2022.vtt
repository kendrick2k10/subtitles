The luckiest--he's

Ric Flair. for good or for bad.

He was very colorful.

- He was just
unbelievably captivating.

38
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.063
- It attracts you from
the moment that you see him

39
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.606
and hear him talk.

40
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.983

no matter what
the consequences may be.

48
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.967
- I got so wrapped up
in being Ric Flair

49
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.636
<i>that I probably neglected</i>
<i>my family a little bit.</i>

50

Ric Flair vulnerable.

51
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.682

52
00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.769

54
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.983

<i>go back into Ric Flair:</i>

55
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:33.153
<i>be a persona. be a character.</i>
<i>so he didn't have to feel.</i>

56
00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.405
<i>It's a battle within him.</i>

57
00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:39.075
<i>'cause he has</i>
<i>to be on all the time.</i>

58
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:42.996
- If anything. it was
"My dad has to slow down."

- Fred Phillips.

100
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.793
I just found that out
three years ago.

101
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.629
- What was
your birth mother's name?

102
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.006
- Yeah.
- The woman

103
00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.257
who gave birth to you.

104
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.760
- I think
it's in my bio somewhere.

105
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.470
I think she was a nurse.
and I think--I thought

106
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.096
he was an architect.

107
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.224
- Your birth mom. again.
according to the biography.

108
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.893
is Olive.
- Kay. right.

109
00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:13.480
- And Luther--
the name of your father.

110
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.398
- Luther--that is--
that's correct.

111

My brother actually
reached out to me.

112
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.321
- How did you find out
you had a brother?

113
00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.323
- Someone reached out to Wendy

114
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.866
<i>through her social media.</i>

115
00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.659
- [sighs]

116
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.746
I would say
about four or five years ago.

117
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.208
there was a person who. um.
had documents.

118
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.627
and he got his adoption papers.

119
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.797
and his mother
was the same mother.

120
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.174
He didn't want anything.
He just wanted to let.

121
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.967
you know. Ric know that.

122
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.928
you know.
they had the same mother.

123
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.305
- Um. I just--she said.
"Do you wanna meet him?"

124
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.473
I said no.

125
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.436
I don't have any curiosity.

126
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:56.147
Got enough to be curious about

127
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.066
without someone
I've never met in my life

128
00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:01.361
and meet him now at 73.

129
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.697

130
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.116

Ruin our life?

131
00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.617
You know. he probably
only wanna meets me

132
00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.327
'cause I'm what I am--

133
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.954

134
00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.872
if that makes sense.

135
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:17.210
- He's always seen himself
as "he's an only child."

136
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.754
<i>and rightfully so.</i>
<i>He was raised an only child.</i>

137
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.674
<i>So he didn't really connect</i>
<i>with the person</i>

138
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.592
<i>or find out any more.</i>

139

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.356
I got two of the greatest

<i>* *</i>

177
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.653
<i>I was raised</i>

178

180
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.534
My dad also had a PhD
in theater and English.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.120
- They were very cultured.
his parents.

182
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.621
and very smart.

183
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.748
<i>Being surrounded</i>
<i>in that environment</i>

184
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.002
<i>helped boost</i>
<i>what was inside of him.</i>

185
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.879
<i>- My parents were</i>
<i>both so smart.</i>

186
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.381
<i>I didn't inherit</i>
<i>any of their genes.</i>

187
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.009
<i>I'm adopted. so</i>

188
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.011
<i>I don't really know</i>
<i>where my genes came from.</i>

189
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.806
<i>but I didn't inherit theirs.</i>

190
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.183
<i>But it wasn't</i>
<i>from lack of effort.</i>

191
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:41.896
I had every opportunity
to be a well-educated kid.

192
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.357
but just a guy
who just looked out the window.

193
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.027
<i>They called it</i>
<i>daydreaming back then.</i>

194
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:49.863
<i>I guess they call it</i>
<i>A.D.D. now.</i>

195
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.032
- When did you
first start drinking?

196
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.077
- 15.

197
00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.287
Regularly.

198
00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.913
<i>Without a 18-year-old ID.</i>

199
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.498
<i>you could drink beer</i>
<i>back then.</i>

200
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.584
<i>I had a fake ID</i>
<i>and drank beer all the time.</i>

201
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.627
I was...

202
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.379
[sighs]
Playing strip poker...

203
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.797
[laughs]
Shit like that.

204
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.175
I mean. if it was available.

205
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.093
<i>I was doing it.</i>

206
00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.054
- He was drinking
at a young age.

207
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.599
He was conforting with females
at a very young age.

208
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.394
<i>and. you know. this was</i>
<i>a source of endless distress</i>

209
00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.898
to his parents.
because it was unthinkable

210
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.025
in that family
that they would have a child

211
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.194
that was that rambunctious.

212
00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.739
<i>- I was just so different.</i>

213
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.866
<i>I was just wild as a kid.</i>

214
00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.119
So they made the decision
to put me in a private school.

215
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:42.749
<i>I went to Wayland Academy</i>
<i>my freshman year.</i>

216
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.250
<i>All the people in that school</i>

217
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.502
<i>came from</i>
<i>very wealthy families.</i>

218
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.420
<i>huge backgrounds.</i>

219
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:50.173
<i>and my friends were all--</i>
<i>at school. it was full of.</i>

220
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.758
<i>like. family that owned</i>
<i>the Blackhawks</i>

221
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.426
<i>in all of Chicago.</i>

222
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.095
<i>Campbell soups.</i>

223
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.263
<i>I mean. OshKosh B'gosh jeans.</i>
<i>name it.</i>

224
00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.891
That school was loaded with
family with a lot of money.

225
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.477
<i>So I saw</i>
<i>the lifestyle I wanted.</i>

226
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.229
<i>I just had to figure out</i>
<i>how to afford it.</i>

227
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.397
<i>[chuckles]</i>

228
00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.484
<i>I was</i>
<i>a state champion wrestler.</i>

229
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.069
<i>all-state in football.</i>

230
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.570
<i>All I wanted to do</i>
<i>was play football.</i>

231
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.364
<i>I mean. that was what I knew</i>

232
00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.074
<i>I wanted to do in college.</i>

233
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.994
<i>I ended up going</i>
<i>to University of Minnesota.</i>

234
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.205
Back then. they helped you
a lot with your academics--

235
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.332
like. just go to class.
and you'll pass.

236
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.961
<i>But I was just there for fun.</i>

237
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.921
<i>I didn't give a damn</i>
<i>about school.</i>

238
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.341
<i>I lived in a fraternity</i>
<i>That was the year after--</i>

239
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.384
<i>after I flunked out.</i>

240
00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:35.343
<i>My parents didn't know.</i>

241
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.849
- How did your parents react

242
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.143
when you told 'em
you'd flunked out?

243
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.982
- Uh. they weren't shocked.

244
00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.109
They weren't shocked.

245
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.320
<i>I sold life insurance</i>
<i>for a year after that.</i>

246
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.489
<i>I never got my license.</i>
<i>but I made 40 grand.</i>

247
00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.700
'cause I just introduced
all the general agents

248
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.953
to my friends around town.
[laughs]

249
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.205
I never actually
passed the test.

250
00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.834
<i>- In 1971. Richard Fliehr</i>

251
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.003
<i>did make</i>
<i>a major life decision.</i>

252
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:13.131
<i>He got married</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

253
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.758
- Leslie.
She's a wonderful lady.

254
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.301
We get along to this day.

255
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.722
<i>- The next year.</i>
<i>they had their first daughter.</i>

256
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.182
<i>Megan.</i>

257
00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:26.186
<i>Now a father. Ric was trying</i>
<i>to find his way.</i>

258
00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:29.064
<i>searching</i>
<i>for his life's purpose.</i>

259
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:32.275
<i>He found it</i>
<i>in a likely location:</i>

260
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.234
<i>a bar.</i>

261
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.072
- Ric Flair was working
as a bouncer

262
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.492
<i>in the Minneapolis area.</i>

263
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.868
<i>- So I'm bouncing.</i>

264
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.286
and I'm sitting here
with my elbow

265
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.996
on the cigarette machine.
on a stool. right?

266
00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.706
And in walks this guy.
and I look--

267
00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.500
[whispers] "Holy fuck."

268
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.960
He's smoking a Salem cigarette

269
00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.546
and sits down
and orders a double vodka

270
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.382
and a soda.

271
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:58.426
I said.
"Fuck. that's Ken Patera."

272
00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.053
<i>- Ken Patera was</i>

273
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:03.056
<i>a very fabled</i>
<i>Olympic weightlifter.</i>

274
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.725
and this Olympian
starts engaging Ric Flair

275
00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.519
in conversation.

276
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.229
- I walk over. and I say.
"You Ken Patera?"

277
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.272
He said. "Yeah.
What's your name?"

278
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.566
I said. "Ric.
Ric Fliehr."

279
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:16.027
He goes. "How ya doing?
You know this town very well?"

280
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.487
I said.
"Yeah. know it real well."

281
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:20.824
- Before you know it.
Ric Flair and Ken Patera

282
00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.575
are living together.

283
00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:25.954
<i>and this Olympian.</i>
<i>who was actually training</i>

284
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.914
for the professional
wrestling world.

285
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.667
was being sponsored
by Verne Gagne.

286
00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.795
<i>- Here's wrestling champion</i>
<i>Verne Gagne.</i>

287
00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:37.257
- Well. here I am.
What's up?

288
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.926
<i>- Verne Gagne was the promoter</i>

289
00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:44.305
for the American
Wrestling Association. or AWA.

290
00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:47.892
<i>which was</i>
<i>a Minneapolis-based promotion.</i>

291
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.145
Every year.
Verne Gagne would put

292
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.564
a class of trainees together.

293
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.149
- You still have the same shock
that you had

294
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.443
the first time
someone threw you down.

295
00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:59.487
<i>but you're building up</i>
<i>a tolerance to it.</i>

296
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.699
<i>- Well. I went to the camp.</i>
<i>enthusiastic as possible.</i>

297
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.160
<i>but I had no idea what I was</i>
<i>getting myself into.</i>

298
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.662
That--two months
with those guys.

299
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.205
legs were chafed.
I couldn't walk.

300
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.124
I mean. Gagne. you know.
came over and got me.

301
00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:12.417
slapped me across the face.

302
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.294
- You don't just
walk out there.

303
00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:15.211
pick him up and lay him down.
We wanna see some action.

304
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.421
wanna see what you can do.

305
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.464
I trained him.

306
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.506
<i>I'd start 'em out</i>

307
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.507
<i>with just knee bends.</i>

308
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:20.800
<i>and we'd do 50</i>

309
00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.010
<i>to 100 knee bends.</i>

310
00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.471
Well. the guys--you know.
at 50.

311
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.014
they fell on their face.

312
00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.390
- Ugh. it was brutal.

313
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.143
That was a--
I mean. first of all.

314
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.354
<i>I was 300 pounds.</i>
<i>I mean. to this day.</i>

315
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.064
<i>you take a good athlete</i>
<i>and tell him to do</i>

316
00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:39.778
500 free squats.
250 push-ups. 200 crunches.

317
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.072
- 200.

318
00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.407
<i>- And run two miles.</i>

319
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:47.660
<i>How many good athletes</i>
<i>can do that right now?</i>

320
00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.080
Like 1%?
Think about it.

321
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.665
And we're doing this
in 30-degree weather outside.

322
00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.668
<i>- Come on. dig. dig. dig. dig!</i>

323

<i>* *</i>

324
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.172
<i>- He was training hard</i>
<i>to become a pro wrestler.</i>

325
00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:02.008
<i>but step one</i>
<i>in Fliehr's metamorphosis</i>

326
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.220
<i>into the character</i>
<i>began with a new name...</i>

327
00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:09.641
Ric Flair.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.351
- Where did the name come from?

329
00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:12.686
- Verne.

330
00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.062
<i>I was so enamored</i>

331
00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:15.814
<i>with Dusty Rhodes.</i>

332
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.441
I said I wanted to call myself
Rambling Ricky Rhodes.

333
00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.943
He got up.
threw his glasses down.

334
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.528
and said.
"Rambling Ricky Rhodes?

335
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.114
"What is it with you
and Dusty Rhodes?

336
00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.449
"Your name is Ric Flair.
That's fucking cool as shit--

Ric Flair."

338
00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.244
I said. "It is?"
He said. "Yeah.

339
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.204

Change the spot."

<i>longest ten minutes</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

344
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:46.302
<i>I was excited about it. but I</i>
<i>didn't know what I was doing.</i>

345
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.388
- What did you make
for your first match?

346
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.347
- 50 bucks.

347
00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:55.645
I spent it coming home.
[laughs]

348
00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:59.774
Man. I have driven 3.000 miles
for $210.

349
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:03.695
<i>I would drive to Winnipeg.</i>
<i>500 each way.</i>

350
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.740
drive back. get home
at 5:00 in the morning. right.

351
00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.950
and get up at noon
and leave for Des Moines. Iowa.

352
00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:11.119
<i>[percussive beat]</i>

353
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.955
- In front of crowds
of how many?

354
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:18.251
- Oh. probably--in Winnipeg.
it was almost always sold out.

355
00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:22.547
but everything else was. like.
50 and 100. maybe 150.

356
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.716
but never--

357
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.385
I just barely--we lived.
basically. off Leslie.

358
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.472
<i>She was a dental hygienist.</i>

359
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.557
<i>I didn't have the experience.</i>

360
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.934
But once I got rolling.
I mean. I liked it so much

361
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.644
that I--when I wasn't booked.

362
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.438
<i>I would travel</i>
<i>with Dusty Rhodes</i>

363
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.106
<i>and Dick Murdoch. just be</i>
<i>their driver.</i>

364
00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.359
<i>I drove Andre for two years</i>

365
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.693
when he was Jean Ferre.

366
00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.195
He actually broke in

367
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.072
<i>the same time</i>
<i>I was breaking in.</i>

368
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.448
<i>and I drove him everywhere.</i>

369
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.784
and when he'd get
to the building. he'd go.

370
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.078
"Boss. get me wine."

371
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.621
One day. David Crockett said.

372
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.040
"No. no. no wine
till after the match."

373
00:15:57.082 --> 00:16:00.126
"Boss. there be no match.
Wine."

374
00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.544
Naw. there was that night

375
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.797
he drank 106 beers
at The Downtowner.

376
00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.215
<i>Verne had me drive him.</i>
<i>It was great.</i>

377
00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.217
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

378
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.344
<i>- Hanging out</i>
<i>with Andre the Giant.</i>

379
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.429
<i>riding with Dusty Rhodes.</i>

380
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:15.975
<i>Ric Flair was traveling</i>
<i>with the best in the business.</i>

381
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:20.146
- So this is 1974.

382
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:23.525
So I get invited to go
to the Carolinas. right?

383
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:27.362
<i>And I'm married at this point.</i>
<i>and we had just had Megan.</i>

384
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:29.030
<i>So I go to my dad.</i>

385
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.032
I said. "Can I have $400
to go down there?"

386
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:36.413
<i>So I flew down there</i>
<i>in April of '74</i>

387
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.332
<i>with 200 bucks in my pocket.</i>

388
00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.543
<i>Left Leslie 200 bucks.</i>

389
00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:45.463
<i>* *</i>

390
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:49.551
<i>And I'd met this guy in a bar.</i>

391
00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:52.512
<i>* *</i>

392
00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:54.764
<i>He said. "You're Ric Flair?"</i>
<i>And I said. "Yeah."</i>

393
00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.516
He said. "You guys ever
thought about flying?

394
00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.185
I hear you drive everywhere."
I said.

395
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.062
"Yeah. I thought about it.
Why?"

396
00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.313
He said. "Well. I got a plane."

397
00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.274
I said. "You got a plane?"

398
00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.192
So I said. you know.
"What are you talking about?"

399
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.445
He said.
"Well. there's five of you.

400
00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.613
I can carry five of you.
only charge you $100 apiece."

401
00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.158
I said.
"Only $100 apiece to fly?"

402
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.242
I said. "How fast does it go?"

403
00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.119
He said. "250 miles an hour."

404
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:17.871
I said. "You're kidding me.
$100 apiece?"

405
00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.330
So bingo.

406
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:23.418
I got five people.
like. right away.

407
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.712
<i>- So Ric Flair</i>
<i>and some of the other guys</i>

408
00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.839
<i>decided that they were</i>
<i>gonna pool their money</i>

409
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.884
and hire a Vietnam veteran
who is a pilot

410
00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.427
to transport them

411
00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.555
around the Charlotte
wrestling territory.

412
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:39.934
and this guy would load up
his plane with talent.

413
00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:43.563
and these were big dudes.
and it was a small plane.

414
00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:47.400
So now he had to compensate
for the extra weight.

415
00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.527
and he did that by dumping

416
00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.738
some of the fuel
from the plane.

417
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:58.036
<i>* *</i>

418
00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:02.624
<i>- We were in</i>
<i>a six-passenger Cessna 310.</i>

419
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.042
<i>* *</i>

420
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.543
<i>We were flying to Wilmington</i>

421
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:09.381
<i>for a night show on Sunday.</i>

422
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.425
So we got to what's called
"the point of no return."

423
00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.469
which I've learned.

424
00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.722
In other words. he should've
refueled in Raleigh.

425
00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.684
We were 1.400 pounds
over gross.

426
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:24.229
and so he compensated for that
by carrying less fuel.

427
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.773
<i>All of a sudden.</i>
<i>we're at 6.000 feet.</i>

428
00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.026
<i>and we're just starting</i>
<i>to descend. and. uh.</i>

429
00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.277
all of a sudden.
the right engine.

430
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.905
it went boop-boop-boop.

431
00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.740
I mean. it pinned.
Bingo.

432
00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:38.368
Within ten seconds.
it was dead. boom.

433
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.037
Then he reached down--
I saw him grab--

434
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.497
he pulled the reserve tanks.

435
00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.332
forgetting he didn't have
any reserve fuel.

436
00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.875
<i>* *</i>

437
00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:49.129
<i>So the left one</i>
<i>just went broop. boom.</i>

438
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.256
and man. we're. you know.

439
00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.800
I would say
between 5.500 and 6.000 feet.

440
00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:54.801
I remember looking at it.

441
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.803
<i>* *</i>

442
00:18:56.845 --> 00:19:00.974
<i>- And at this point.</i>
<i>there was real panic going on.</i>

443
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.684
The pilot began to freak out.

444
00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:05.145
<i>and the great Johnny Valentine</i>

445
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:06.396
<i>was sitting next to the pilot.</i>

446
00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.148
<i>and he. being a wrestler.</i>

447
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.067
he figured. "Well.
I'll slap some sense into him."

448
00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.194
and he started
slapping the pilot

449
00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.363
to try to get him to focus.

450
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:18.533
[plane whirring rapidly]

451
00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:31.212
[plane whirring rapidly]

452
00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:32.756
<i>- We were going so fast.</i>

453
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.674
<i>probably</i>
<i>over 300 miles an hour.</i>

454
00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.052
that normally.
when you hit a tree orchard.

455
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.220
a small plane--it would
cartwheel a small plane.

456
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:42.349
We mowed the tree orchard down.

457
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.893
- I think they barely missed
the water tower.

458
00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:48.521
and they might have
even landed safely

459
00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.940
<i>had there not been</i>
<i>some electric lines there.</i>

460
00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.485
<i>But because</i>
<i>of the circumstances.</i>

461
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.487
<i>they ended up crashing.</i>

462
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.989
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

463
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.576

one--or maybe 300 yards
on the runway.

465
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.208
- It was truly a calamity.

<i>in one of these</i>
<i>old military ambulances.</i>

471
00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:35.110
<i>and so the guy goes...</i>

472
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.696
"I think you better hurry.
I think we're losing this one."

473
00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.572
Well. I'm sure
we all thought the same thing.

474
00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:40.657
I thought
he was talking about me.

475
00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.034
and actually. it was the pilot.

476
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.414
<i>- The pilot was in a coma</i>

477
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.458
<i>and lingered there</i>
<i>for about a year.</i>

478
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.129
Johnny Valentine was paralyzed

479
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.382
from the waist down
for the rest of his life.

480
00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.926
and Ric Flair ended up
breaking his back

481
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.012
in several places.

482
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:03.722
<i>- I broke my back</i>
<i>in three places</i>

483
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.057
<i>and tore my stomach apart--</i>

484
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.810
compression fracture.
I used to be 6'2".

485
00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.562
So the vertebrae
about this far apart.

486
00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:11.604
normally. in your back.

487
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:13.106
<i>So I had three of them</i>

488
00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.357
<i>that were all</i>
<i>crunched together.</i>

489
00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:17.986
<i>so maybe two inches shorter.</i>

490
00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:20.321
- What were you told.
initially. in the hospital

491
00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:21.781
about your future?

492
00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:24.743
- Oh. I'd never wrestle again.
never.

493
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.037
- What was your first thought
when you heard that?

494
00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:29.164
<i>* *</i>

495
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.583

"What am I gonna do?

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.419
I got a wife and kid."

498
00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.838
I mean. I can remember
me and my daughter Megan

499
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.591
walking up and down
the street in my back brace.

500
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.510
and then on that. laid on--
all I could do for rehab

501
00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:45.764
was I would lay on my stomach
and do--

502
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.099
arch up.
That's all I could do.

503
00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.392
That's the only rehab
you could do.

504
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.563
<i>- 1975. the plane crash</i>

505
00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.191

<i>His back was broken</i>

<i>He says he lost</i>

508

<i>Flair had been wrestling</i>

509
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.620

<i>But Flair refused to quit.</i>

511
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.667
<i>He worked harder.</i>
<i>building back his strength.</i>

512
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.460
<i>and within six months.</i>

513
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:19.172
<i>Richard Fliehr had become</i>
<i>Ric Flair once again.</i>

514
00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:21.216
<i>He was back in the ring.</i>

515
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:23.259
<i>That is when</i>
<i>he created the persona</i>

516
00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:24.469
<i>that would define him.</i>

517
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:26.388

<i>* *</i>

520
00:22:30.141 --> 00:22:34.354
- The Ric Flair
who we all have in our mind

521
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:36.481
came in steps.

522
00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:38.149
<i>When he started training.</i>

523
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:41.361
<i>he was kind of</i>
<i>a chunky brown-haired guy.</i>

524
00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.655
<i>- Flair did have a couple</i>
<i>matches under his belt.</i>

525
00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:45.532
<i>but yet he was a rookie.</i>

526
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.659
<i>and a rookie is gonna make</i>
<i>mistakes.</i>

527
00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:51.287
<i>- And then "Superstar"</i>
<i>Billy Graham's wife</i>

528
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.665
dyed his hair blond.

<i>* *</i>

530
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:59.254
<i>And ultimately.</i>
<i>while he was working there.</i>

531
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:02.173
<i>somebody said</i>
<i>that he reminded them</i>

532
00:23:02.215 --> 00:23:04.426
of the original Nature Boy.
Buddy Rogers.

<i>[rock music]</i>

534
00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:07.220

<i>but checked himself.</i>

536
00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:12.100

<i>* *</i>

538
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:16.771
<i>- When the good Lord made me.</i>
<i>He threw the mold away</i>

539
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.732
when it comes
to the wrestling business.

540
00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:20.567
- Who was Buddy Rogers?

541
00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:22.277
- The first Nature Boy.

542
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:23.653
<i>and he was cut.</i>

543
00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:24.738
<i>handsome.</i>

544
00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:25.780
<i>really good physique.</i>

545
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:26.865
<i>tan all the time.</i>

546
00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.742
<i>I thought he was cool.</i>

547
00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:31.077
- But there's one thing
I want everybody to know.

548
00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.079
[crowd booing]
And that is. to a nicer guy.

549
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:34.873
it couldn't happen.

550
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.791
- That's part of where I got
the clothing gig--from him.

551
00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.626
He was always
dressed immaculately.

552
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:41.463
I got that from him
and Joe Namath.

553
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:42.922
<i>That's what I grew up on--Joe.</i>

554
00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:44.883
<i>and when I met him--</i>
<i>and I told him.</i>

555
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:47.969
<i>I got a lot</i>
<i>of attitude from him.</i>

556
00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:51.306
Here I am. looking better
than any man alive.

557
00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:54.642

<i>the new Ric Flair.</i>

561
00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:01.566
- How did the character

562
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:03.485
begin to evolve. Ric?

564
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:07.864
<i>- Uh. I don't know.</i>
<i>Every day. it just got better.</i>

565
00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:09.866
<i>I just got more natural.</i>

566
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:13.703
<i>and I--I felt much better</i>
<i>about myself being 240</i>

567
00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:16.623
<i>than I did when I was heavier.</i>

568
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.708
<i>and it really helped</i>
<i>my work too.</i>

569
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.001
<i>The more extravagant I was.</i>

570
00:24:20.043 --> 00:24:21.586
<i>the more attention I got.</i>

571
00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:23.171
<i>The first robe was $3.000--</i>

572
00:24:23.213 --> 00:24:24.839
<i>that butterfly robe.</i>
<i>the white one?</i>

573
00:24:24.881 --> 00:24:26.341
And then I started going.

574
00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:27.759
I think the last one
I paid for was. like.

575
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:29.427

<i>I bought the governor's</i>

<i>and paid a guy 25 bucks.</i>

580
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.563
I got him late every night

581
00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:42.649

in a limousine.

582
00:24:42.691 --> 00:24:43.983

591
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.376

00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:29.876
People ask me all the time.
They're like.

683
00:28:29.918 --> 00:28:31.127
"Are you fucking still alive?"

684
00:28:31.169 --> 00:28:33.129
I say. "Yeah. motherfucker.
very much."

685
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:35.173
Woo!

00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:38.176
<i>- Alive and thriving.</i>

687
00:28:38.218 --> 00:28:40.637

688
00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:42.013
Tearing it all up!

689
00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:44.307
<i>- By the mid-'80s.</i>
<i>Flair was increasingly</i>

690
00:28:44.349 --> 00:28:47.018
<i>spending money to raise</i>
<i>the profile of his character</i>

691
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.605
<i>and getting lost</i>
<i>in the Nature Boy lifestyle.</i>

692
00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:52.816
- When I started earning.
I started spending.

693
00:28:52.857 --> 00:28:55.735
<i>I spend more money</i>
<i>on spilt liquor</i>

694
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:58.530

696
00:29:02.826 --> 00:29:04.536
<i>I was living large.</i>

697
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:05.870
I wanted people to know

698
00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:07.706

fucking dicking around.

699
00:29:07.747 --> 00:29:09.791
<i>I have to fulfill</i>

00:29:29.436 --> 00:29:30.520
Woo!

710
00:29:30.562 --> 00:29:32.147
<i>- The suits. the Rolex.</i>

711
00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:33.523

<i>and there just wasn't</i>
<i>anything about him</i>

715
00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:42.574
that didn't ooze
charisma and fun.

716
00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:45.744
- I got the biggest house
on the biggest hill

717
00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:47.120
on the biggest side of town!

718
00:29:47.162 --> 00:29:48.955
Every time I heard "no."

719
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.415
I proved "yes."

720
00:29:50.457 --> 00:29:52.000
So this realtor
said to me.

721
00:29:52.042 --> 00:29:54.127
"Your credit is
never gonna be able

722
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:55.045
to afford a $2 million house."

723
00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:56.546
I said. "Really?"

724
00:29:56.588 --> 00:29:58.673
I got a realtor
and bought the house.

725
00:29:58.715 --> 00:30:02.177
I--and I borrowed 200 grand
from my dad to help do it.

726
00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:04.304
because it was called. um--

727
00:30:04.346 --> 00:30:05.889
original. right?

728
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.683
And I paid him back.
and he went.

729
00:30:08.725 --> 00:30:10.268
"I'm really proud of you."
'cause I borrowed money

730
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.937
from him over the years
and hadn't paid him back.

731
00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:15.732
<i>And then. my parents came down</i>
<i>from Minneapolis.</i>

732
00:30:15.774 --> 00:30:18.526
My dad walked in the house
and said. "Really?

733
00:30:18.568 --> 00:30:20.153
You need all this?"

734
00:30:20.195 --> 00:30:23.823
<i>- They didn't really see</i>
<i>the importance in that.</i>

735
00:30:24.407 --> 00:30:27.911
- What's the point of the air
through here?

736
00:30:27.952 --> 00:30:29.621
- That's the gimmick. Dad.

737
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:32.540
- I think that he never
felt good enough.

738
00:30:32.582 --> 00:30:34.292
<i>- I don't know</i>
<i>if they ever got it.</i>

739
00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:35.794
<i>They were very conservative.</i>

740
00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:37.754
<i>Me. not so much.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

741
00:30:37.796 --> 00:30:38.880
- How many pairs of shoes?

742
00:30:38.922 --> 00:30:40.465
- Oh. in my lifetime?

743
00:30:40.507 --> 00:30:42.926
About 200 pairs
of alligator leather shoes--

744
00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:44.219
skin shoes.

745
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.429
<i>I know it's hard to believe.</i>

746
00:30:46.471 --> 00:30:50.100
<i>but I didn't want to ever wear</i>
<i>the same thing on TV twice.</i>

747
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:51.768
<i>and if you look back on tapes.</i>

748
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.896
<i>you're gonna see</i>
<i>very few things I wore twice.</i>

749
00:30:54.938 --> 00:30:56.773
<i>We taped once a week.</i>

750
00:30:56.815 --> 00:30:59.859
<i>So I probably bought</i>
<i>four suits a week</i>

751
00:30:59.901 --> 00:31:02.237
for 36 years.

752
00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:04.447
<i>- He believed</i>
<i>in looking the part</i>

00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:07.409
<i>and dressing for who you were</i>
<i>and where you were going.</i>

754
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.619
as opposed
to where you had come from.

755
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:11.454
- Styling

756
00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:13.248
and profiling!

757
00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:14.958
- Why is it necessary?

758
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.336
- 'Cause I'm Ric Flair!

759
00:31:18.378 --> 00:31:20.088
Woo!

760
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.965
I wanted to set the bar

761
00:31:22.007 --> 00:31:24.551

nobody could ever get it.

762
00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:28.304
I represent

763
00:31:28.346 --> 00:31:29.973
<i>I lived the gimmick</i>

764

<i>the word "moderation."</i>

765
00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:33.852
- How did you afford this?

766
00:31:33.893 --> 00:31:36.146
- Because I wasn't paying
my taxes.

767
00:31:36.187 --> 00:31:39.524
I mean. I didn't--
I just didn't slow down.

768
00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:42.027
Totally my fault.
Irresponsible.

769
00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:44.529
Woo!

770
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:46.948

771
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.992

- Woo!

772
00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:52.162
<i>- Fame became his barometer.</i>

773
00:31:52.203 --> 00:31:53.872
- Flair. Ric Flair.

774
00:31:53.913 --> 00:31:55.874
Now. like. a flight attendant
me how to spell it.

775
00:31:55.915 --> 00:31:59.294
I go. "F-A-M-O-U-S."

<i>the man once known</i>

778
00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:06.092

<i>nationwide.</i>

784
00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:26.529
- We're talking

785
00:32:26.571 --> 00:32:30.784
the most successful group

<i>anywhere in the world.</i>

787
00:32:33.036 --> 00:32:35.413
- The Four Horsemen
were a faction

788
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:37.916
that kind of came together

789
00:32:37.957 --> 00:32:40.460
rather spontaneously.

790
00:32:40.502 --> 00:32:43.338

793
00:32:46.383 --> 00:32:49.010

794
00:32:49.052 --> 00:32:51.304
<i>and they became</i>

795
00:32:51.346 --> 00:32:54.265
the most charismatic faction

796
00:32:54.307 --> 00:32:55.975
- We are the Horsemen.

797
00:32:56.017 --> 00:33:00.230
- The origin story
of how you guys came together?

798
00:33:00.271 --> 00:33:02.065
- Arn just said it one day.

799
00:33:02.107 --> 00:33:03.233
<i>just off the top of his head.</i>

800
00:33:03.274 --> 00:33:05.151
<i>You know. it wasn't planned.</i>

801
00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:06.194
<i>Arn just said.</i>
<i>"This is the apocalypse.</i>

802
00:33:06.236 --> 00:33:07.946
<i>We're The Four Horsemen."</i>

803
00:33:07.987 --> 00:33:09.239

<i>I mean. it was crazy.</i>

805
00:33:11.449 --> 00:33:14.244
It was insane.
and all because Arn did this.

806
00:33:14.285 --> 00:33:15.453
<i>- We're a unit!</i>

807
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:17.914
The Four Horsemen
are not four individuals!

808
00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:21.209
- We are the studs
in professional wrestling!

809
00:33:21.251 --> 00:33:23.128
- We'd go into the ring.

810
00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:25.922

"Horsemen."

828
00:34:05.545 --> 00:34:10.759

00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:17.784
- I wanna inform the tourists.

856
00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:19.953
especially
all the young ladies.

857
00:35:19.994 --> 00:35:22.914
<i>you don't have to go</i>
<i>to Disney World</i>

858
00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:24.708
to find Space Mountain.

859
00:35:24.749 --> 00:35:25.709
It's right here.

860
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:28.378
- When Ric Flair would go on TV

861
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.131
<i>and say</i>
<i>where he was staying in town.</i>

862
00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:33.717
<i>and "Meet me in the penthouse</i>
<i>at the Marriott."</i>

863
00:35:33.758 --> 00:35:36.011
that was real!

864
00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:38.346
- "I'll be at the Marriott--

865
00:35:38.388 --> 00:35:40.974
"18 to 28. no boyfriends.
no husbands.

866
00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.101
you can ride Space Mountain
all night long."

867
00:35:43.143 --> 00:35:46.271
[laughing]

868
00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.485
You know. I--I've been plugging
Marriotts my whole life.

869
00:35:52.527 --> 00:35:54.279
My wife would say.
"Why do you keep saying

870
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.864
we're gonna be
at the Marriott?"

871
00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:57.449
I said. "Oh. they give us
a discount on that.

872
00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.159
Some of them don't
even charge us--free drinks."

873
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.704
[laughs]

874
00:36:02.746 --> 00:36:04.873
"Why aren't you wearing
your wedding ring?"

875
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:06.750
"I can't wear that on TV.
That's not my gimmick."

876
00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:09.711
[laughing]

877
00:36:11.629 --> 00:36:14.758
When you get on Space Mountain.
you'll be like this!

878
00:36:17.135 --> 00:36:19.346
- How would you characterize...

879
00:36:19.387 --> 00:36:20.597
- Women?
- Yes.

880
00:36:20.638 --> 00:36:23.892
- I have a disease.
I love women.

881
00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:26.353
[women screaming]

882
00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:27.354
<i>Listen. look.</i>

883
00:36:27.395 --> 00:36:28.438
<i>You know--hey.</i>

884
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.649
[laughing]

885
00:36:33.276 --> 00:36:34.277
<i>I love women.</i>

886
00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:36.071
<i>To this day. I love 'em.</i>

887
00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:39.407
Damn it.
[laughing]

888
00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:42.535
I have four or five women
every day of my life!

889
00:36:42.577 --> 00:36:45.038
<i>I don't buy their love.</i>

890
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.123
<i>but I know how to talk to 'em.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

891
00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:49.209
Even at 73. I can be Slick Ric.

892
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.379
[laughing]

893
00:36:55.715 --> 00:36:58.635
- Everybody fantasizes
about the cars.

894
00:36:58.677 --> 00:37:00.804
and you're usually seen
with attractive women

895
00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:03.014
on either arm.
Is that really the life.

896
00:37:03.056 --> 00:37:04.516
or is that the gimmick?

897
00:37:04.557 --> 00:37:07.811
- Um. well. I think.
aside from the fact

898
00:37:07.852 --> 00:37:10.939
that my wife is--will be
watching this program--

899
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.774
- Oh. I did not know that.
Oh...

900
00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:15.110
<i>- How many times</i>
<i>have you been married?</i>

901
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:16.152
- Four.

<i>* *</i>

903
00:37:20.824 --> 00:37:24.160
<i>My first wife. Leslie--</i>
<i>great woman.</i>

904
00:37:24.202 --> 00:37:25.412
<i>I still talk to her today.</i>

<i>* *</i>

906
00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:31.584

<i>"I can't live like this."</i>

<i>* *</i>

908
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:36.715
<i>- By the mid-1980s.</i>

909
00:37:36.756 --> 00:37:38.758
<i>Richard Fliehr</i>
<i>had two children.</i>

910
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.468
<i>a son and daughter.</i>

911
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.929
<i>and his family life</i>
<i>was collapsing.</i>

912
00:37:42.971 --> 00:37:44.848
<i>For whatever</i>
<i>was missing at home.</i>

913
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:47.308
<i>Flair went all in at work.</i>

914
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.563
<i>building the Ric Flair</i>
<i>character without limits.</i>

915
00:37:51.604 --> 00:37:54.190
<i>Life on the road</i>
<i>was a fantasy.</i>

916
00:37:54.232 --> 00:37:56.192
<i>Life at home</i>

917
00:37:56.234 --> 00:37:57.861
<i>was real.</i>

918
00:37:57.902 --> 00:38:01.156
<i>So he escaped</i>
<i>whenever he could.</i>

919
00:38:01.197 --> 00:38:03.950
- You know. it was just me
and my mom and David.

920
00:38:03.992 --> 00:38:05.827
We didn't live
in a fancy house.

921
00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:08.204
and we didn't drive fancy cars.

922
00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:09.956
<i>So it was--</i>

923
00:38:09.998 --> 00:38:11.708
<i>you know.</i>
<i>my mom worked two jobs.</i>

924
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.378
and it was almost
like you felt abandoned--

925
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.504
would maybe be the best word.

926
00:38:16.546 --> 00:38:18.631
<i>and it wasn't by choice.</i>

927
00:38:18.673 --> 00:38:21.217
<i>We just never had</i>
<i>that one-on-one time.</i>

928
00:38:21.259 --> 00:38:23.887
- I got so wrapped up in being
Ric Flair the last ten years

929
00:38:23.928 --> 00:38:26.765
that I probably neglected
my family a little bit.

930
00:38:26.806 --> 00:38:31.269
but it's been successful for me
in promoting myself

931
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:33.313
and making me successful
in professional wrestling.

932
00:38:33.355 --> 00:38:36.316
<i>- His occupation has made it</i>
<i>difficult at times</i>

933
00:38:36.358 --> 00:38:38.068
<i>to have a family.</i>

934
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:40.987
<i>Now he is in the final weeks</i>
<i>of an expensive divorce.</i>

935
00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:44.783
- They grew up
on their own without me.

936
00:38:46.284 --> 00:38:47.744
<i>It was horrible.</i>

937
00:38:47.786 --> 00:38:49.746
<i>And I missed the shit.</i>

938
00:38:49.788 --> 00:38:51.581
Megan. I mean.
we laugh about it now.

939
00:38:51.623 --> 00:38:53.208
We don't laugh about it.
but she--

940
00:38:53.249 --> 00:38:54.751
<i>I told her I'd be</i>
<i>at a basketball game.</i>

941
00:38:54.793 --> 00:38:56.044
<i>and I didn't make it.</i>

942
00:38:56.086 --> 00:38:58.755
<i>* *</i>

943
00:38:58.797 --> 00:39:00.924
And she had never
forgotten that.

944
00:39:00.965 --> 00:39:03.885
<i>- He spent more time</i>
<i>being Ric Flair</i>

945
00:39:03.927 --> 00:39:06.096
<i>than he did Richard Fliehr.</i>

946
00:39:06.137 --> 00:39:10.767
<i>and so even when he would</i>
<i>come home off the road.</i>

947
00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:12.811
<i>it was people reaching out</i>
<i>for autographs</i>

948
00:39:12.852 --> 00:39:14.771
or. "Can we do this?
Can we do that?"

949
00:39:14.813 --> 00:39:16.022
<i>- I'm conscious of the fans.</i>

950
00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:18.233
and I'm conscious
of their support.

951
00:39:18.274 --> 00:39:20.068
and I'm conscious
of what they've made possible

952
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.319
for me in my life.

953
00:39:21.361 --> 00:39:23.947
- What kind of father
do you think you are?

954
00:39:23.988 --> 00:39:26.783
<i>- When I was there.</i>
<i>as good as could be.</i>

955
00:39:26.825 --> 00:39:28.952
<i>But how often was I there?</i>

956
00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:32.330
So how can I--not even a fair--

957
00:39:32.372 --> 00:39:36.167
I can't be judged on what I--
something I didn't do.

958
00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:37.335
I wasn't there.

959
00:39:37.377 --> 00:39:39.254
<i>* *</i>

960
00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:41.131
<i>If you're Ric Flair</i>
<i>for so long.</i>

961
00:39:41.172 --> 00:39:43.466
<i>how do you ever go back</i>
<i>to being Richard Fliehr?</i>

962
00:39:43.508 --> 00:39:45.468
<i>I don't wanna be</i>
<i>Richard Fliehr.</i>

963
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.096
<i>Maybe when I'm dead.</i>

964
00:39:48.138 --> 00:39:50.098
- I don't think he knows
who Richard Fliehr is.

965
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.852
<i>I think that was lost</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

966
00:39:53.893 --> 00:39:56.479
- They get a glimpse
of Richard when he cries.

967
00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:59.816
when he's emotional around 'em.

968
00:39:59.858 --> 00:40:02.736
<i>but it doesn't last long.</i>

969
00:40:02.777 --> 00:40:04.988
He's Ric Flair.

970
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:09.784
<i>He wants the world</i>
<i>to always know who he is.</i>

971
00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:13.997
- You can't have a family
and be a pro wrestler.

972
00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:17.167
You can be married.
but you're never home.

973
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:20.587
and if you're
the World Champion like I was--

974
00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:23.798
365. twice on Saturday.
twice on Sunday

975
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.010

<i>* *</i>

977
00:40:28.928 --> 00:40:32.682

<i>professional wrestling</i>
<i>territories</i>

979

984
00:40:48.448 --> 00:40:49.783
- Hello. everyone.

985
00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:51.076
Welcome to
"Championship Wrestling."

986
00:40:51.117 --> 00:40:52.369
At ringside.
this is Vince McMahon

987
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.120
along with Mean Gene Okerlund.

988
00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:55.372
and this week--

989
00:40:55.413 --> 00:40:58.166
<i>- Vince McMahon saw</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

990
00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:00.126
with cable television

991
00:41:00.168 --> 00:41:04.047
<i>to promote</i>
<i>the entire country</i>

992
00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:05.632
<i>off of</i>

993
00:41:05.674 --> 00:41:07.717
<i>one or two</i>
<i>television shows.</i>

994
00:41:07.759 --> 00:41:10.804
<i>- Welcome to WrestleMania!</i>

995
00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:13.098
<i>- He was looking to expand.</i>
<i>and did.</i>

996
00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:19.938
At the end. it was pretty much
just WWE and Jim Crockett

997
00:41:19.979 --> 00:41:22.607
<i>out of Charlotte.</i>
<i>North Carolina.</i>

998
00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:25.735
<i>Ted Turner ended up buying</i>

999
00:41:25.777 --> 00:41:28.071
<i>what Jim Crockett had.</i>
<i>the NWA.</i>

1000
00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:30.573
<i>and turned it into</i>
<i>World Championship Wrestling.</i>

1001
00:41:30.615 --> 00:41:31.908
<i>and they became. pretty much.</i>

1002
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.202
the last two standing

1003
00:41:34.244 --> 00:41:35.704
of any prominence

1004
00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:37.580
in the business.

1005
00:41:37.622 --> 00:41:40.208
<i>- WWE was a family business.</i>

1006
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.128
<i>and people who came</i>
<i>from the McMahon family</i>

1007
00:41:43.169 --> 00:41:46.923
<i>were making</i>
<i>the decisions in WWE.</i>

1008
00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:51.594
WCW was part
of a larger corporate entity.

1009
00:41:51.636 --> 00:41:53.430
and so you had executives.

1010
00:41:53.471 --> 00:41:56.433
<i>who didn't necessarily have</i>
<i>wrestling backgrounds.</i>

1011
00:41:56.474 --> 00:42:00.937
<i>making decisions that impacted</i>
<i>the lives of the talent.</i>

1012
00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:04.441
<i>and I believe that Ric</i>
<i>was a bit hurt by this.</i>

1013
00:42:04.482 --> 00:42:08.111
- It was frustrating for him.
because. I mean. obviously.

1014
00:42:08.153 --> 00:42:11.823
you're a wrestling organization
producing TV.

1015
00:42:11.865 --> 00:42:14.034
<i>and the next day.</i>
<i>you're a TV organization</i>

1016
00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:15.326
<i>producing wrestling.</i>

1017
00:42:15.368 --> 00:42:17.746
<i>Things were changing.</i>

1018
00:42:17.787 --> 00:42:19.414
- Having new people come in

1019
00:42:19.456 --> 00:42:24.002
and Jim Herd not knowing
anything about the business--

1020
00:42:24.044 --> 00:42:25.962
they just tried
to change my character.

1021
00:42:26.004 --> 00:42:27.630
They wanted
to call me Spartacus.

1022
00:42:27.672 --> 00:42:29.090
They cut my hair.

1023
00:42:29.132 --> 00:42:30.467
I didn't even know
who I was anymore.

1024
00:42:30.508 --> 00:42:32.302

00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:34.929
- You know. they just kept
trying to reinvent the wheel.

1026
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:37.432
and this was a guy that was
kind of a proven entity.

1027
00:42:37.474 --> 00:42:39.309
and it was just. like--
to him. it was baffling.

1028
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:42.062
It's just like. "Well.
I'm the Nature Boy. Ric Flair."

1029
00:42:42.103 --> 00:42:43.772
Like. "What are you doing?"

1030
00:42:43.813 --> 00:42:45.982
<i>- He was asked</i>
<i>to take a pay cut.</i>

1031
00:42:46.024 --> 00:42:47.901
<i>This deeply hurt Ric Flair.</i>

1032
00:42:47.942 --> 00:42:50.487
<i>and I think</i>
<i>he actually experienced</i>

1033
00:42:50.528 --> 00:42:51.946
<i>legitimate anxiety.</i>

1034
00:42:51.988 --> 00:42:54.324
He was having panic attacks.

1035
00:42:54.366 --> 00:42:57.911
He couldn't believe that
he was being treated like this.

1036
00:42:57.952 --> 00:42:59.287
<i>- I cut my hair.</i>

1037
00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.663
I walked
into the Charlotte airport.

1038
00:43:00.705 --> 00:43:02.040
Nobody knew me.

1039
00:43:02.082 --> 00:43:03.667
I didn't know myself.
I mean. it just--

1040
00:43:03.708 --> 00:43:06.169
it killed me.
That was it.

1041
00:43:06.211 --> 00:43:08.505
<i>I lost all</i>

1042

1043
00:43:09.798 --> 00:43:10.965
I--I literally--I--

1044
00:43:11.007 --> 00:43:13.968
I fell out that day

1045
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.805
because I gave in
to a fucking idiot.

1046
00:43:16.846 --> 00:43:19.599
<i>I was lost.</i>

1047
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:22.018
<i>I was--I was just lost.</i>

1048
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.895
<i>- He couldn't be Ric Flair</i>

1049
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:26.439

<i>that he wanted to be</i>

1050

<i>in WCW anymore</i>

1051
00:43:28.608 --> 00:43:32.195
and felt
he needed to go elsewhere.

1052
00:43:32.237 --> 00:43:35.865

really. for him to go.

1053
00:43:35.907 --> 00:43:38.201
<i>and that was WWE.</i>

1054
00:43:38.243 --> 00:43:40.245
<i>- Well.</i>
<i>it was the only alternative.</i>

1055
00:43:40.286 --> 00:43:42.372
<i>and I--you know. I got</i>
<i>to talk to Vince on the phone</i>

1056
00:43:42.414 --> 00:43:45.083
<i>and said.</i>
<i>"I'm not crying wolf.</i>

1057
00:43:45.125 --> 00:43:47.711
<i>I will come if you want me."</i>

1058
00:43:47.752 --> 00:43:48.878
He said. "I don't believe you."

1059
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.380
I said. "I got the belt."

1060
00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:52.632
He said. "Send it.
and I'll believe you."

1061
00:43:52.674 --> 00:43:55.427
I overnighted it to him.

1074
00:44:23.246 --> 00:44:26.708

come to the competition.

00:49:36.393 --> 00:49:38.812
<i>was not the Ric Flair</i>
<i>character talking.</i>

1192
00:49:38.853 --> 00:49:42.190
<i>It was Richard Fliehr</i>
<i>as a husband and father</i>

1193
00:49:42.232 --> 00:49:43.983
<i>of four children.</i>

1194
00:49:44.025 --> 00:49:45.819
<i>- Well. I'm kind of taken</i>
<i>by the moment. obviously.</i>

1195
00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.612
<i>but I--I was. um.</i>

1196
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:48.530
really overwhelmed
by the support.

1197
00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:50.490
and. uh. you know. first.

1198
00:49:50.532 --> 00:49:52.534
I never had my family on TV.
so it's a big deal for me.

1199
00:49:52.575 --> 00:49:55.161
and thank you.
<i>- Woo!</i>

1201

<i>My oldest sibling</i>
<i>is my sister. Megan.</i>

1203

<i>He had Reid and I later on</i>
<i>in his career.</i>

1207
00:50:15.724 --> 00:50:17.809
<i>So he was home a lot more</i>
<i>for Reid and I</i>

1208
00:50:17.851 --> 00:50:20.562
<i>than my sister</i>
<i>and my older brother.</i>

1209
00:50:20.603 --> 00:50:22.605
<i>He had</i>
<i>a different relationship</i>

1210
00:50:22.647 --> 00:50:24.107
<i>with all four of his kids.</i>

1211
00:50:24.149 --> 00:50:26.192
<i>The relationship we have</i>

1212
00:50:26.234 --> 00:50:28.361

You know.
I'd wanna be with him.

1218

I would have.

- [laughs]
He loved me.

1229
00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:05.065
You couldn't scare Reid.
He was tougher than shit.

1230
00:51:05.106 --> 00:51:07.692
On top of that. he was
a real good amateur wrestler.

1232

<i>and then once Hulk got there.</i>

1271
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.211

1276
00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:00.722

<i>I kind of stacked the deck</i>

1277
00:53:00.764 --> 00:53:02.390
<i>and brought Shaq in with me.</i>

1278
00:53:02.432 --> 00:53:04.351

00:53:15.403 --> 00:53:17.238
He couldn't have been happier.

1285
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.033
But '96 comes around.

1286
00:53:20.075 --> 00:53:23.036
and this nWo thing
starts catching fire.

1287
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:25.955
and...

1288
00:53:25.997 --> 00:53:28.166
that's where
all of the attention went.

1289
00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:32.087
<i>- The new World order</i>
<i>is taking over</i>

1290
00:53:32.128 --> 00:53:34.130
<i>professional wrestling!</i>

1291
00:53:34.172 --> 00:53:36.549
<i>- That was</i>
<i>the new bright. shiny object</i>

1292
00:53:36.591 --> 00:53:40.053
<i>that was really.</i>
<i>really working well.</i>

1293
00:53:40.095 --> 00:53:46.601
All of a sudden. the focus goes
from Ric Flair to the nWo.

1294
00:53:46.643 --> 00:53:49.062
and Ric Flair's character
becomes a victim.

1295
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.650
<i>- It's tough</i>
<i>when you're the man.</i>

1296
00:53:53.692 --> 00:53:57.153
<i>and you go by "the man."</i>

1297
00:53:57.195 --> 00:54:00.615
and then you're not the guy?

1298
00:54:00.657 --> 00:54:02.575
<i>Tough to swallow sometimes.</i>

1299
00:54:02.617 --> 00:54:04.327
- He took one for the team.

1300
00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:05.787
You know. spray-painting Ric

1301
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:07.831
<i>or spray-painting his hair</i>

1302
00:54:07.872 --> 00:54:10.000
<i>or whatever chicanery</i>
<i>we were doing.</i>

1303
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:11.960
<i>He helped get</i>
<i>that nWo thing going.</i>

1304
00:54:12.002 --> 00:54:15.672
because to punk out
a big star like that.

1305
00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:18.508
you know. it was just
a setup for us--whoa.

1306
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:20.468
I'll get you too!

1307
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:23.054
- Ric was on the wrong side
of that equation

1308
00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:24.973
at that particular time.

1309
00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:28.560
<i>Everybody was getting punked.</i>
<i>Everybody was getting beat.</i>

1310
00:54:28.601 --> 00:54:30.687
<i>Everybody was</i>
<i>being disrespected.</i>

1311
00:54:30.729 --> 00:54:32.564
<i>- This is our show!</i>

1312
00:54:32.605 --> 00:54:34.649
<i>We're doing it our way!</i>

1313
00:54:34.691 --> 00:54:38.278
- I wish I would've been better
and more aware

1314
00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:41.948
<i>of how talent is sometimes</i>
<i>affected by certain things.</i>

1315
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:43.992
<i>because to me.</i>
<i>it was just all business.</i>

1316
00:54:44.034 --> 00:54:47.328
<i>- The nWo. not finished</i>
<i>making a statement right here</i>

1317
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:48.788
<i>to Ric Flair.</i>

1318
00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.206
- He couldn't think
of enough ways

1319
00:54:50.248 --> 00:54:52.459
to fuck me around.

1320
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.419
That's all he did.

1321
00:54:54.461 --> 00:54:56.796
<i>- Now they're shaving</i>
<i>Ric Flair's head!</i>

1322
00:54:56.838 --> 00:54:59.341
<i>- What is the deal with.</i>
<i>you know. shaving my head?</i>

1323
00:54:59.382 --> 00:55:02.177
<i>What did that accomplish?</i>

1324
00:55:02.218 --> 00:55:03.553
- Well. what do you mean

1325
00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:04.554
you don't want
to get your head shaved.

1326
00:55:04.596 --> 00:55:06.181
spray-painted black.

1327
00:55:06.222 --> 00:55:08.975
drug through town
on the back of a pickup truck.

1328
00:55:09.017 --> 00:55:10.185
<i>beat with sticks?</i>
<i>What do you mean</i>

1329
00:55:10.226 --> 00:55:11.519
<i>you don't wanna do that?</i>

1330
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:13.646
<i>That's money.</i>
<i>That's a story!</i>

1331
00:55:13.688 --> 00:55:15.648
Of course you wanna do that.

1332
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:16.649
No.
[chuckles]

1333
00:55:16.691 --> 00:55:18.068
Sometimes he didn't.

1334
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:20.653
and there were
a number of occasions

1335
00:55:20.695 --> 00:55:21.988
<i>where we went too far.</i>

1336
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.615
<i>Ric. in particular.</i>
<i>took it real hard.</i>

1337
00:55:23.656 --> 00:55:25.492
<i>and it took its toll on Ric.</i>

1338
00:55:25.533 --> 00:55:26.951
did some--
did some damage there.

1339
00:55:26.993 --> 00:55:28.453
I didn't know it at the time.

1340
00:55:28.495 --> 00:55:31.081
I wish--
I really wish I would have.

1341
00:55:31.122 --> 00:55:33.833
<i>- In 1998.</i>
<i>Ric Flair did something</i>

1342
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:35.794
<i>he hadn't often done before.</i>

1343
00:55:35.835 --> 00:55:37.420
<i>He chose his family</i>

1344
00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:40.298
<i>over the professional</i>
<i>wrestling business.</i>

1345
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.801
<i>On a spring night.</i>
<i>Flair didn't show up</i>

1346
00:55:42.842 --> 00:55:45.887
<i>to a WCW show. and instead.</i>

1347
00:55:45.929 --> 00:55:49.349
<i>went to his son Reid's</i>
<i>amateur wrestling match.</i>

1348
00:55:49.391 --> 00:55:52.143
- Ric and I got
into a little bit of a debate.

1349
00:55:52.185 --> 00:55:53.895
He wanted some time off.

1350
00:55:55.146 --> 00:55:59.192
He. to this day.
swears he requested it.

1351
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:01.111
Everybody on my side
of the equation said...

1352
00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:02.278
[chuckles]
"Didn't hear anything

1353
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.988
about this request."

1354
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:05.782
Anyway.
he just took the time off.

1355
00:56:05.824 --> 00:56:08.493
It escalated.
and it got out of control.

1356
00:56:08.535 --> 00:56:11.788
<i>- I am taking my son</i>

<i>I didn't have the time off.</i>

1359
00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:17.210
Oh. it was a nightmare.

1360
00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:19.421
I've never been
more fucked in my life

1361
00:56:19.462 --> 00:56:21.381
than Bischoff fucking me.

1362
00:56:21.423 --> 00:56:25.301
- I basically said.
"Ric. either you show up.

1363
00:56:25.343 --> 00:56:27.053
"or I'm gonna sue you
for breach of contract.

1364

1365
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.306
- He fucked me out of millions.

1366
00:56:30.348 --> 00:56:32.058
One guy
fucking your whole life up.

1367
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.560
I mean. really--

1368
00:56:33.601 --> 00:56:35.395
cost me a fortune.

1369
00:56:35.437 --> 00:56:36.730
<i>- There were stories</i>

1370

"We can turn this
into some money."

1379
00:56:50.785 --> 00:56:52.537

to go with it

1380
00:56:52.579 --> 00:56:53.747
with a storyline.

1381
00:56:53.788 --> 00:56:55.623
- This is real!

1382
00:56:55.665 --> 00:56:58.460
This is not bought
and paid for!

1383
00:56:58.501 --> 00:57:02.213
It's a real-life situation!

1384
00:57:02.255 --> 00:57:03.840

1385
00:57:03.882 --> 00:57:05.425
not the best--
but some of the best work

1386
00:57:05.467 --> 00:57:08.219

1388
00:57:09.679 --> 00:57:12.807
You. I hate your guts!

1389
00:57:12.849 --> 00:57:14.225
- Now. granted. we shook hands.

1390
00:57:14.267 --> 00:57:16.102
we put it behind us.
and we agreed to make it

1391
00:57:16.144 --> 00:57:19.314
a part of a storyline.
but the emotion didn't go away.

1392

You're history!

1393
00:57:20.398 --> 00:57:22.817

You're a cheat!

1399
00:57:34.996 --> 00:57:37.290

1400
00:57:37.332 --> 00:57:38.875
and try to bankrupt me

1401
00:57:38.917 --> 00:57:40.335

tournament with my son?

1402
00:57:40.377 --> 00:57:41.920

1409
00:57:54.891 --> 00:57:56.518

Tell 'em. Reid.

- Thing was that cosmetically.

1428
00:58:50.655 --> 00:58:53.658
Ric Flair didn't even feel
like he should be in the ring.

1429
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.077
<i>Ric Flair kept his T-shirt on</i>

Warner left WCW.

1440
00:59:22.937 --> 00:59:25.357

<i>- When Ric came back</i>

1452
00:59:56.429 --> 01:00:01.101
Ric was a shell of the man
that he was before.

01:00:01.142 --> 01:00:03.019
<i>- I remember Vince</i>
<i>coming to me and saying.</i>

<i>You wanna work with this guy.</i>

And I was like. "I wanna work

Are you kidding me?"

I said. "I don't know.
Do you think I can do it?"

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:19.619
He said.
"I know you can do it.

<i>But you couldn't tell me that</i>
<i>getting out there.</i>

1468
01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:35.260
Self-confidence is such
a big part of life in general.

1469
01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:37.554
<i>- It was later on</i>

01:02:53.523 --> 01:02:55.108
<i>to being what he could be.</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1524
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.860
<i>I used to say to him</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

1525
01:02:56.901 --> 01:02:59.154
"You're the only guy here that
doesn't know you're Ric Flair.

1526
01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:00.363
<i>What's the matter with you?"</i>

1527
01:03:02.323 --> 01:03:05.201
- It's the truth.
He said it to me all the time.

1528
01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:06.494
<i>and I said.</i>
<i>"You can tell me that</i>

1529
01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:09.581
<i>all day long.</i>
<i>I still don't."</i>

1530
01:03:09.622 --> 01:03:14.210
I mean. that's five solid years
of Eric just pounding me.

1531
01:03:14.252 --> 01:03:16.629
<i>* *</i>

1532
01:03:16.671 --> 01:03:19.924
- Well. I guess being around
the business when I was young.

1533
01:03:19.966 --> 01:03:21.676
<i>just listening to my--</i>

1534
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:23.386
<i>like. hearing my mom and dad's</i>
<i>conversations.</i>

1535
01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:26.097
<i>like. yeah.</i>
<i>he was pretty not--</i>

1536
01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:28.433
<i>didn't feel like</i>
<i>the man anymore.</i>

1537
01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:31.144
- I think Ric Flair
is the barometer

1538
01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:33.396
of the greatest World Champion
of all time.

1539
01:03:33.438 --> 01:03:35.690
You are Ric Flair.
16-time World Champion.

1540
01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:37.942
and I respect that.

1541
01:03:37.984 --> 01:03:39.903
<i>You know. it's hard to look</i>
<i>at a guy like that</i>

1542
01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:42.614
<i>and think that there could be</i>
<i>anything wrong with him.</i>

1543
01:03:42.655 --> 01:03:44.824
<i>because you kind of put him</i>
<i>on a pedestal.</i>

1544
01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:46.701
- He had so much. still.
to give to the business.

1545
01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:48.328
and then. you know.
when you're around him.

1546
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:51.164
you can see guys
wanting to pick his brain.

1547
01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.749
and guys wanting
to work with him.

1548
01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.542
but he didn't have
his confidence to help them.

1549
01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:58.588
and so it just started
as something as simple

1550
01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:01.591
<i>as me thinking. "Well. if we</i>
<i>took a couple of young guys.</i>

1551
01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:05.095
<i>"and put us all together</i>
<i>as a group. made a faction.</i>

1552
01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:06.429
it can be incredibly good."

1553
01:04:06.471 --> 01:04:09.099
And what you see
in this ring before you

1554
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.269
is the greatest example
of evolution you will ever see.

1555
01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:15.146
<i>- Triple H says</i>
<i>that his entourage</i>

1556
01:04:15.188 --> 01:04:18.149
<i>is the evolution</i>
<i>of our business.</i>

1557
01:04:18.191 --> 01:04:21.277
- That was
a very unique quartet.

1558
01:04:21.319 --> 01:04:25.407
You had Ric Flair.
who represented legacy.

1559
01:04:25.448 --> 01:04:28.660
<i>Then you had Triple H.</i>
<i>who was the present.</i>

1560
01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:30.495
<i>and then you had the future.</i>

1561
01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:32.455
<i>You had Randy Orton</i>

1562
01:04:32.497 --> 01:04:36.251
<i>and Batista--</i>
<i>future Hollywood star.</i>

1563
01:04:36.292 --> 01:04:38.628
- I picked those guys' brains.
[laughs]

1564
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.505
I was like that annoying
little kid in the back seat.

1565
01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:41.881
<i>I never rode up front.</i>

1566
01:04:41.923 --> 01:04:43.174
<i>[laughing] I was always</i>
<i>in the back seat.</i>

1567
01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:45.301
- Wow. you got
something special.

1568
01:04:45.343 --> 01:04:48.471
<i>- I can tell you</i>
<i>with complete honesty.</i>

1569
01:04:48.513 --> 01:04:51.766
<i>if I hadn't had access</i>
<i>to their brains.</i>

1570
01:04:51.808 --> 01:04:54.019
I never would have made it
to the level that I did--

1571
01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.687
not a chance.

1572
01:04:55.729 --> 01:04:58.523
<i>- We are the best of the best.</i>

1573
01:04:58.565 --> 01:04:59.649
Woo!

1574
01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:00.608
<i>- I was young.</i>
<i>and I didn't know</i>

1575
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.944
what it was to be champion.

1576
01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:04.696
<i>You know.</i>
<i>it got thrust upon me.</i>

1577
01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:07.407
<i>and I had a lot of learning</i>
<i>on the job.</i>

1578
01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:10.326
but I was around the best guys
in the business for that.

1579
01:05:10.368 --> 01:05:12.203
- No fear. man.
Let's go.

1580
01:05:12.245 --> 01:05:14.039
<i>- I would stand</i>
<i>in the backstage</i>

1581
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.623
with Richard Fliehr.

1582
01:05:15.665 --> 01:05:17.417
but when the curtain opened up.
and we walked through.

1583
01:05:17.459 --> 01:05:19.044
I was with Ric Flair.

1584
01:05:19.085 --> 01:05:20.837
<i>and he could feel it.</i>

1585
01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:24.299
<i>He just couldn't carry it</i>
<i>all the time then.</i>

1586
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.009
<i>But it was definitely--</i>
<i>as time went on.</i>

1587
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:29.471
<i>he was definitely becoming</i>
<i>the Nature Boy again.</i>

1588
01:05:29.512 --> 01:05:31.723
<i>- I'm 55 years old.</i>
<i>and I'm in Evolution.</i>

1589
01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:33.808
and I'm walking down the aisle.

1590
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.353
It was almost like a rib
with Hunter. Dave. and Randy--

1591
01:05:36.394 --> 01:05:38.188
you know. immaculate.

1592
01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:39.814
<i>and I'm physically.</i>

1593
01:05:39.856 --> 01:05:41.566
<i>I mean.</i>
<i>"Please. this is a joke."</i>

1594
01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:44.027
<i>I just wore my robe</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

1595
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:46.654
<i>I never got it back totally.</i>

1596
01:05:46.696 --> 01:05:49.157
<i>It gave me life again.</i>

1597
01:05:49.199 --> 01:05:50.116
<i>It gave me life.</i>

1598
01:05:50.158 --> 01:05:51.576
and I was ready.

1599
01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:54.037
<i>- Flair's done it!</i>
<i>Flair's done it!</i>

1600
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:57.582
<i>The Nature Boy is</i>
<i>the Intercontinental Champion!</i>

1601
01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:59.084
<i>- Where are we going?</i>

1602
01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:00.377
Woo!
It's LA. Vince.

1603
01:06:00.418 --> 01:06:01.544
We're going down to the strip.

1604
01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:02.837
<i>It's a party!</i>
<i>Woo!</i>

1605
01:06:02.879 --> 01:06:05.507
<i>With the champ!</i>
<i>[laughter]</i>

1606
01:06:06.424 --> 01:06:08.718
<i>- It was easy to assume</i>
<i>that at that time.</i>

1607
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.846
there just couldn't be that
much gas left in the tank.

1608
01:06:11.888 --> 01:06:14.641
<i>and yet. man.</i>

1609
01:06:14.683 --> 01:06:18.812
<i>it turned into a special</i>
<i>next six. seven years</i>

1610
01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:20.522
<i>with so many</i>
<i>memorable moments.</i>

1611
01:06:20.563 --> 01:06:24.901
- And I love being
the Nature Boy!

1612
01:06:24.943 --> 01:06:28.571
<i>* *</i>

1613
01:06:28.613 --> 01:06:31.282
- I don't remember
the actual circumstances.

1614
01:06:31.324 --> 01:06:32.867
but. you know.
it was getting to a point

1615
01:06:32.909 --> 01:06:36.162
where. you know. Evolution
had kind of run its course.

1616
01:06:36.204 --> 01:06:38.123
<i>and he was still kind of doing</i>
<i>the things he was doing.</i>

1617
01:06:38.164 --> 01:06:40.208
<i>but I think he was getting</i>
<i>to a point where people were</i>

1618
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.335
<i>starting to worry</i>
<i>about him in the ring.</i>

1619
01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:44.087
- Ah. shit!

1620
01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:45.338
<i>- I'm not sure he was fully.</i>

1621
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.798
<i>in his mind. ready to retire.</i>

1622
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.551
<i>I think Vince sort of broached</i>

1623
01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:51.344
<i>the subject with him.</i>

1624
01:06:51.386 --> 01:06:52.595
Vince was like.
"Look. there's a reason

1625
01:06:52.637 --> 01:06:54.180
"they put a jockey
on a racehorse.

1626
01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:55.348
"Somebody's gotta
pull the reins.

1627
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:56.725
or they will run
until they die."

1628
01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:58.518
<i>So the decision was made.</i>

1629
01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.728
<i>Like. we'll put you</i>
<i>in the Hall of Fame.</i>

1630
01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:01.396
<i>and then do your last match.</i>

1631
01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:04.983
<i>but that was tough for Ric.</i>

1632
01:07:05.025 --> 01:07:08.111
<i>Everything about Ric</i>
<i>is the Nature Boy Ric Flair.</i>

1633
01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:11.031
<i>* *</i>

1634
01:07:11.072 --> 01:07:14.325
- It's at a moment like this

1635
01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:15.869
when guys like me...

1636
01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:20.749
Say to themselves
for all we've done wrong.

1637
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.208
we must've done
something right.

1638
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.501
[chuckles]

1639
01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:27.464
<i>So I can't tell you how much</i>

1640
01:07:27.505 --> 01:07:29.257
<i>all this means to me.</i>

1641
01:07:29.299 --> 01:07:31.092
<i>* *</i>

1642
01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:33.845
<i>I just wanted everybody</i>
<i>to know along the way.</i>

1643
01:07:33.887 --> 01:07:35.805
people in my life--
and I've had a long life.

1644
01:07:35.847 --> 01:07:37.265
a lot of people
say "thank you."

1645
01:07:37.307 --> 01:07:39.142
<i>* *</i>

1646
01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:41.144
<i>Shawn Michaels.</i>

1647
01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:46.024
<i>I want to wrestle you</i>
<i>at WrestleMania.</i>

1648
01:07:46.066 --> 01:07:48.902
<i>- I think anybody that commits</i>
<i>their life to something.</i>

1649
01:07:48.943 --> 01:07:51.321
um. no matter
what line of work it is.

1650
01:07:51.363 --> 01:07:53.782
but certainly. I think.

1651
01:07:53.823 --> 01:07:57.410
<i>in the athletic field.</i>
<i>it's a big and major decision.</i>

1652
01:07:57.452 --> 01:08:00.330
I honestly wanted
to honor all of that

1653
01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:01.498
<i>in that last match.</i>

1654
01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:03.208
- It would be my honor

1655
01:08:03.249 --> 01:08:05.502
to wrestle you at WrestleMania.

1656
01:08:08.421 --> 01:08:10.173
<i>- Woo!</i>

1658
01:08:17.972 --> 01:08:19.391

[scanner beeping]

1660
01:08:21.559 --> 01:08:23.395
- Woo!

1661
01:08:23.436 --> 01:08:25.438
<i>- My life is one incredible</i>

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1663
01:08:27.857 --> 01:08:29.818
You know. it's like I said--
for all I've done wrong.

1664
01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:34.197
I must've done something right
somewhere to get all this.

1665
01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:37.117
<i>It's hard</i>
<i>to say goodbye and leave</i>

1666
01:08:37.158 --> 01:08:40.829
<i>something</i>
<i>you've done for so long.</i>

1667
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:43.206
<i>- The decision for Ric</i>
<i>to retire</i>

1668
01:08:43.248 --> 01:08:45.834
<i>may have been more Vince's</i>
<i>than it was Ric's.</i>

1669
01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:47.752
But also. at the same time.

1670
01:08:47.794 --> 01:08:51.798
I don't remember Ric fighting
it too vigorously either.

1671
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.133
<i>Vince looked at it as.</i>

1672
01:08:53.174 --> 01:08:54.551
<i>"You've had</i>
<i>a hell of a career.</i>

1673
01:08:54.592 --> 01:08:56.845
<i>"but you don't need to be</i>
<i>taking bumps anymore.</i>

1674
01:08:56.886 --> 01:08:58.638
<i>"You don't need to be</i>
<i>in the ring anymore.</i>

1675
01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.682
"and let's give you
the send-off

1676
01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:04.936
that's worthy of your career."

1677
01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:09.315
<i>- 2008. WrestleMania XXIV.</i>

1678
01:09:09.357 --> 01:09:12.027
<i>After 36 years of wrestling.</i>

1679
01:09:12.068 --> 01:09:16.781
<i>the WWE ending for Ric Flair</i>

<i>retirement.</i>

1681
01:09:19.034 --> 01:09:22.537
<i>and his family was ringside</i>
<i>to see it all.</i>

1682
01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:32.005
<i>- He is the best</i>
<i>at what he does.</i>

1683
01:09:32.047 --> 01:09:35.258
and the word "proud"
doesn't even describe.

1684
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.926
you know. I guess.

1685
01:09:36.968 --> 01:09:38.553
how any of us feel

01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:28.732
<i>* *</i>

1855
01:17:28.773 --> 01:17:30.233
<i>- He had it.</i>
<i>He's tough.</i>

1856
01:17:30.275 --> 01:17:31.568
He's good-looking.

1857
01:17:31.609 --> 01:17:32.861
Girls love him--

1858
01:17:32.902 --> 01:17:33.903
ton of personality.

1859
01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:35.613
He'll nail it.

1860
01:17:35.655 --> 01:17:37.365
<i>- He is the son</i>
<i>of the Nature Boy. Ric Flair.</i>

1861
01:17:37.407 --> 01:17:39.117
<i>but make no mistake about it.</i>

1862
01:17:39.159 --> 01:17:41.369
<i>he is his own man.</i>

1863
01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:43.413
<i>- As Reid entered his 20s.</i>

1864
01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:45.040
<i>he wanted to be</i>
<i>like his father.</i>

1865
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:47.667
<i>who had crossed over</i>
<i>from the wrestling world</i>

1866
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:49.210
<i>to pop culture.</i>

1867
01:17:49.252 --> 01:17:52.172
- Ric Flair is unquestionably

1868
01:17:52.213 --> 01:17:55.759
one of the greatest
entertainers of all time.

1869
01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.261
- I think he did a good job
of keeping up with the times.

1870
01:17:58.303 --> 01:17:59.763
keeping his name relevant.

1871
01:17:59.804 --> 01:18:01.848
<i>- He made a lot</i>
<i>of people happy.</i>

1872
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.350
He made me happy.

1873
01:18:03.391 --> 01:18:06.269
and he made people
all over the world happy.

1874
01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:08.480
<i>- Everything about him said.</i>

1875
01:18:08.521 --> 01:18:12.275
"I'm here to make sure
you are entertained."

1876
01:18:12.317 --> 01:18:14.986
<i>- He made appearances</i>
<i>on TV shows.</i>

1877
01:18:15.028 --> 01:18:16.571
- You can't do that.

1878
01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:18.907
- Oh. little lady.
that's where you're wrong.

1879
01:18:18.948 --> 01:18:20.241
I'm the Nature Boy.

1880
01:18:20.283 --> 01:18:21.785
<i>- Cartoons.</i>

1881
01:18:21.826 --> 01:18:23.661
- Woo. woo. woo. woo!

1882
01:18:23.703 --> 01:18:24.621
<i>- Video games.</i>

1883
01:18:24.662 --> 01:18:25.997
<i>- Looks to me like a trainee</i>

1884
01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:28.124
<i>who could use a few pointers.</i>

1885
01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:29.751
<i>- Even in Hollywood.</i>

1886
01:18:29.793 --> 01:18:33.296
<i>For Reid.</i>
<i>his father was his hero.</i>

1887
01:18:35.548 --> 01:18:37.926
<i>- Ric liked to have Reid</i>
<i>around all the time.</i>

1888
01:18:37.967 --> 01:18:40.804
but that also meant
if you're with Ric

1889
01:18:40.845 --> 01:18:42.180
all the time.

1890
01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:44.683
you've got to deal
with the persona.

1891
01:18:44.724 --> 01:18:47.894
and Reid wanted
to be Ric Flair.

1892
01:18:47.936 --> 01:18:49.479
<i>- The Figure Four.</i>

1893
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:52.023
<i>just like his daddy</i>
<i>always taught him.</i>

1894
01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:53.983
- For Reid.
there was some big push for him

1895
01:18:54.025 --> 01:18:57.404
to get him into WWE.
I think. at that time.

1896
01:18:57.445 --> 01:19:00.490
<i>- Reid was like.</i>
<i>"We can do this together.</i>

1897
01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:02.450
<i>You've gotta do this."</i>

1898
01:19:02.492 --> 01:19:06.162
<i>I had no prior</i>
<i>wrestling experience.</i>

1899
01:19:06.204 --> 01:19:08.873
I don't know
what made me say "okay"--

1900
01:19:08.915 --> 01:19:10.625
whether it was
all Reid's encouragement.

1901
01:19:10.667 --> 01:19:11.918
whether I thought
that Reid and I were

1902
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.586
gonna do this together...

1903
01:19:13.628 --> 01:19:17.340
I do believe
he had a tryout prior to this

1904
01:19:17.382 --> 01:19:18.466
to be in the WWE.

1905
01:19:19.426 --> 01:19:20.885
<i>- But. you know.</i>

1906
01:19:20.927 --> 01:19:22.470
<i>Reid had flunked</i>
<i>two or three drug tests.</i>

1907
01:19:22.512 --> 01:19:24.389
so they couldn't take him.

1908
01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:25.932
He had to sit home for a year.

1909
01:19:25.974 --> 01:19:29.602
<i>* *</i>

1910
01:19:29.644 --> 01:19:31.229
<i>- He was really. really close</i>

1911
01:19:31.271 --> 01:19:32.564
<i>with my daughter. Morgan.</i>

1912
01:19:32.605 --> 01:19:36.860
but he would start showing up
to things

1913
01:19:36.901 --> 01:19:40.071
after using whatever it was
he had used that day.

1914
01:19:40.113 --> 01:19:43.033
and he just--she--she just
couldn't be around him.

1915
01:19:43.074 --> 01:19:45.994
<i>I kind of just</i>
<i>had to draw the line.</i>

1916
01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:48.621
<i>I had to set up boundaries.</i>

1917
01:19:48.663 --> 01:19:50.665
<i>- He had been out</i>
<i>of every rehab center.</i>

1918
01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:53.376
<i>I mean. I could--</i>
<i>every six months.</i>

1919
01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:56.796
<i>he would have</i>
<i>a meltdown and go off.</i>

1920
01:19:56.838 --> 01:19:58.465
As I'm saying it.
you come to realize

1921
01:19:58.506 --> 01:20:00.925
it's not a addiction.

1922
01:20:00.967 --> 01:20:02.427
It's a disease.

1923
01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:04.137
<i>* *</i>

1924
01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:07.599
<i>You know when I finally</i>
<i>realized how bad it was?</i>

1925
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.811
All he ever wanted was
to wear my dad's Rolex watch.

1926
01:20:11.853 --> 01:20:13.396
which I had
in a safety deposit box

1927
01:20:13.438 --> 01:20:15.857
for him.
Actually. his mom did.

1928
01:20:15.899 --> 01:20:18.735
And he goes.
"Dad. I--I." you know.

1929
01:20:18.777 --> 01:20:21.363
"I'm responsible enough now."

1930
01:20:21.404 --> 01:20:24.407
When he sold that to buy drugs.

1931
01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:25.784
I knew how bad it was.

1932
01:20:25.825 --> 01:20:32.707
<i>* *</i>

1933
01:20:32.749 --> 01:20:35.251
<i>We were leaving the next day</i>
<i>for WrestleMania.</i>

1934
01:20:35.293 --> 01:20:36.586
He went back to the hotel.

1935
01:20:36.628 --> 01:20:39.089
and you know.
he had his own room.

1936
01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:41.508
- Reid had called me and said.
"Come into town.

1937
01:20:41.549 --> 01:20:42.884
"I'll meet you
at the restaurant.

1938
01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:45.970
My dad will be there.
Let's just all go together."

1939
01:20:46.012 --> 01:20:48.139
- He was there.
and he wasn't drinking.

1940
01:20:48.181 --> 01:20:49.683
He was drinking water.

1941
01:20:49.724 --> 01:20:53.937
but a bag of pills
fell out of his pocket.

1942
01:20:53.978 --> 01:20:55.397
So I picked up the pills.

1943
01:20:55.438 --> 01:20:56.731
and I just put 'em
in my pocket.

1944
01:20:56.773 --> 01:20:58.608
- He was eating next to me.

1945
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:01.361
and he just was out of it.
He was not feeling good.

1946
01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:04.781
He said.
"I'ma go back to the room."

1947
01:21:04.823 --> 01:21:07.283
Before he left the restaurant.

1948
01:21:07.325 --> 01:21:08.660
when he stood up. he said.

1949
01:21:08.702 --> 01:21:10.370
"Wendy. do me one favor."

1950
01:21:10.412 --> 01:21:11.871
I said. "What's that?"
And he goes.

1951
01:21:11.913 --> 01:21:14.040
"Please take care
of my father."

1952
01:21:16.418 --> 01:21:18.294
- I went back.
and there he was.

1953
01:21:18.336 --> 01:21:19.838
Um. I knock on the door.

1954
01:21:19.879 --> 01:21:21.464
and he was laid back
like this.

1955
01:21:21.506 --> 01:21:23.967
like I've seen him
a thousand times.

1956
01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:25.635
So I just picked him up.
laid him down on bed.

1957
01:21:25.677 --> 01:21:27.262
and I just had
made up my mind--

1958
01:21:27.303 --> 01:21:29.139
"I'm just not even gonna
wake him up in the morning.

1959
01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.224
I have to finally do what
they've been telling me to do."

1960
01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:33.476
They call it
kicking him to the curb.

1961
01:21:33.518 --> 01:21:36.021
where you just cut 'em off.

1962
01:21:36.062 --> 01:21:38.815
- I stayed back. and I wish
I would've gone in the room.

1963
01:21:38.857 --> 01:21:41.484
because then I would've saw
the needle on the floor.

1964
01:21:41.526 --> 01:21:47.407
<i>* *</i>

1965
01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:51.327
- The next day. my dad met
my daughter and I at Starbucks.

1966
01:21:51.369 --> 01:21:53.455
and he was so mad at Reid.

1967
01:21:53.496 --> 01:21:56.291
He's like.
"He got messed up last night."

1968
01:21:56.332 --> 01:21:58.585
- Ric was mad. and he was like.

1969
01:21:58.626 --> 01:22:00.420
"We gotta get going.
Reid's not up.

1970
01:22:00.462 --> 01:22:01.463
"You know.
if he doesn't get going.

1971
01:22:01.504 --> 01:22:03.006
we're gonna leave him."

1972
01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:04.674
- I said. "I'm just gonna go
see what he's doing."

1973
01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:07.761
and I walked in.
and he was purple.

1974
01:22:07.802 --> 01:22:08.762
and I...

1975
01:22:10.138 --> 01:22:13.183
- And that's when
Ric started screaming.

1976
01:22:13.224 --> 01:22:15.060
Ric knew right away.
He knew.

1977
01:22:48.677 --> 01:22:50.220
- I just--
the guy came in and said.

1978
01:22:50.261 --> 01:22:51.388
"Ric. you need to leave
the room for a minute."

1979
01:22:51.429 --> 01:22:53.014
you know?

1980
01:22:53.056 --> 01:22:54.140
And the guy walked out.
and he said.

1981
01:22:54.182 --> 01:22:56.935
"Ric. he didn't make it."

1982
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:14.536
I walked down the stairs
to the lobby and bar.

1983
01:23:14.577 --> 01:23:15.829
I walked behind the bar.

1984
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.789
and I threw a six pack down.

1985
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:19.791
and I--I didn't stop.

01:23:22.293 --> 01:23:23.920

01:24:56.554 --> 01:24:57.722
<i>It seems like a long time ago.</i>

2023
01:24:57.764 --> 01:24:59.474
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

2024
01:24:59.516 --> 01:25:06.648
<i>* *</i>

2025
01:25:16.533 --> 01:25:23.665
<i>* *</i>

2026
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:40.682
<i>* *</i>

2027
01:25:48.106 --> 01:25:50.525
<i>- My dad was still</i>
<i>in Charlotte. where I was.</i>

2028
01:25:50.567 --> 01:25:52.402
and. um.

2029
01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:53.987
he was bad.

2030
01:25:54.029 --> 01:25:55.739
- I don't know how he survived

2031
01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.574
all the things
he was going through.

2032
01:25:57.615 --> 01:26:01.745
I think what he did was
just go back into Ric Flair--

2033
01:26:01.786 --> 01:26:03.496
<i>be a persona. be a character.</i>

2034
01:26:03.538 --> 01:26:04.748
<i>so he didn't have to feel.</i>

2035
01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.669
- And when...
[sniffles]

2036
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:11.880
Reid passed away.

2037
01:26:11.921 --> 01:26:14.090
<i>there were never any doubts</i>

2038
01:26:14.132 --> 01:26:16.426
<i>whether I was</i>
<i>gonna keep doing it.</i>

2039
01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:19.012
<i>My focus was.</i>
<i>"I'm gonna do this."</i>

2040
01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:21.765
I don't know how. but I will.

2041
01:26:22.724 --> 01:26:24.601
<i>- Because of Reid.</i>

2042
01:26:24.642 --> 01:26:26.770
She's all there for Reid.

2043
01:26:26.811 --> 01:26:30.607
- I had started
to make friends.

2044
01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:32.025
<i>figure out.</i>

2045
01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:33.568
<i>like. "Oh. I really like this.</i>

2046
01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:35.111
<i>"I fit in.</i>

2047
01:26:35.153 --> 01:26:36.863
This is really cool."
but at the same time.

2048
01:26:36.905 --> 01:26:39.115
like. this is everything
that he wanted to be doing.

2049
01:26:39.157 --> 01:26:41.743
I'll make you proud.
- And you always do.

2050
01:26:41.785 --> 01:26:43.995
<i>* *</i>

2051
01:26:44.037 --> 01:26:48.375
<i>- Charlotte Flair has</i>
<i>furthered her father's legacy.</i>

2052
01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:50.293
<i>He had the Figure Four.</i>

2053
01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:53.088
<i>She did him one better.</i>
<i>and she does the Figure 8.</i>

2054
01:26:53.129 --> 01:26:54.964
<i>She has the beautiful robes.</i>

2055
01:26:55.006 --> 01:26:57.384
and she has that charisma.

2056
01:26:57.425 --> 01:27:00.220
<i>There is nobody</i>
<i>who wants to miss</i>

2057
01:27:00.261 --> 01:27:02.389
<i>Charlotte Flair's</i>
<i>ring entrance.</i>

2058
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:04.641
<i>because no one</i>
<i>ever wanted to miss</i>

2059
01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:06.810
<i>Ric Flair's ring entrance.</i>

2060
01:27:06.851 --> 01:27:08.978
<i>- This is</i>
<i>how you make an entrance.</i>

2061
01:27:10.689 --> 01:27:12.941
- I think there's a little bit
of a guilt for her with that.

2062
01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:14.109
because that was something

2063
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:16.653
Reid wanted so. so. so bad.

2064
01:27:16.695 --> 01:27:18.279
<i>and she got it.</i>

2065
01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:20.782
<i>- I'm living his dream.</i>
<i>and he never got to be there.</i>

2066
01:27:20.824 --> 01:27:22.742
That is very hard at the time

2067
01:27:22.784 --> 01:27:24.577
to not think
about those things.

2068
01:27:24.619 --> 01:27:27.706
<i>I just think it put</i>
<i>certain things in my mind</i>

2069
01:27:27.747 --> 01:27:30.166
in motion that maybe hadn't

2070
01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:32.002
necessarily been there before.

2071
01:27:32.043 --> 01:27:33.837
Like. now I'm not
just fighting for myself.

2072
01:27:33.878 --> 01:27:36.631
I'm fighting for him.

2073
01:27:36.673 --> 01:27:38.091
<i>* *</i>

2074
01:27:38.133 --> 01:27:39.551
<i>- So excited for her.</i>

2075
01:27:39.592 --> 01:27:42.262
I love it--

2076
01:27:42.303 --> 01:27:44.639
the greatest honor
a father could ever have.

2077
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:51.813
<i>* *</i>

2078
01:27:55.608 --> 01:27:56.568

- Woo!

2080
01:27:57.527 --> 01:27:58.695
- Woo!

2081
01:27:58.737 --> 01:27:59.863
Whoa!
- Ah!

2082
01:27:59.904 --> 01:28:03.074
[laughter]

2083
01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.165
<i>- My dad--and this is where</i>
<i>he spent his whole life.</i>

2084
01:28:10.206 --> 01:28:11.624
<i>You know.</i>
<i>he had two boys that wrestled.</i>

2085
01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:15.128
So I don't think that
he pictured. you know.

2086
01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:17.589
walking out at WrestleMania
with his daughter.

2087
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:21.634
<i>and my robe tonight</i>
<i>has pieces of his last robe</i>

2088
01:28:21.676 --> 01:28:23.428
<i>that he retired in--in it.</i>

2089
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:27.182
Like. this is from his
WrestleMania XXIV robe.

2090
01:28:27.223 --> 01:28:29.017
<i>This is what he--</i>

2091
01:28:29.059 --> 01:28:30.477
<i>you know.</i>
<i>this is what he lived for--</i>

2092
01:28:30.518 --> 01:28:34.356
and I get to be
an extension of that.

2093
01:28:34.397 --> 01:28:35.648
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

2094
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:36.858
<i>- 2016...</i>

2095
01:28:39.027 --> 01:28:40.362
<i>Dallas. Texas.</i>

2096
01:28:40.403 --> 01:28:42.364
<i>* *</i>

2097
01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:45.241
<i>30-year-old</i>
<i>Ashley "Charlotte" Fliehr</i>

2098
01:28:45.283 --> 01:28:49.204
<i>had made it to the big time:</i>
<i>WrestleMania.</i>

2099
01:28:49.245 --> 01:28:51.581
<i>Ric was there.</i>
<i>in his mid-'60s.</i>

2100
01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:54.167
<i>by his daughter's side.</i>
<i>mentoring her</i>

2101
01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:56.628
<i>on a rise to superstardom.</i>

2102
01:28:56.670 --> 01:28:58.838
<i>He was back on the road.</i>

2103
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:06.012
<i>* *</i>

2104
01:29:08.056 --> 01:29:11.351
- The life on the road
for Ric Flair was tough.

2105
01:29:11.393 --> 01:29:15.021
<i>and it was filled</i>
<i>with some demons too.</i>

2106
01:29:18.274 --> 01:29:21.569
- Ric was going through a lot
that time.

2107
01:29:21.611 --> 01:29:24.155
He had lost his son.

2108
01:29:24.197 --> 01:29:26.074
and we--
from the outside looking in.

2109
01:29:26.116 --> 01:29:27.742
we don't know what that's like.

2110
01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:31.121
A parent losing a kid
has to be the hardest thing

2111
01:29:31.162 --> 01:29:32.831
you could ever imagine.

2112
01:29:32.872 --> 01:29:34.124
<i>I watched Ric.</i>

2113
01:29:34.165 --> 01:29:36.001
<i>He put himself through hell.</i>

2114
01:29:36.042 --> 01:29:37.585
<i>um. after that.</i>

2115
01:29:37.627 --> 01:29:39.546
<i>It was almost like</i>
<i>he wanted to die.</i>

2116
01:29:39.587 --> 01:29:42.632
<i>It was almost like</i>
<i>he wanted to just end it all.</i>

2117
01:29:42.674 --> 01:29:44.759
<i>* *</i>

2118
01:29:44.801 --> 01:29:47.345
<i>- If I drank a lot</i>
<i>before my son died.</i>

2119
01:29:47.387 --> 01:29:49.472
I drank wa--

2120
01:29:49.514 --> 01:29:52.475
[sobs]

2121
01:29:54.144 --> 01:29:58.690
I drank 10:00 a.m.
to 2:00 a.m... [sobbing]

2122
01:29:58.732 --> 01:30:00.817
every day--

2123
01:30:00.859 --> 01:30:02.277
10:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.

2124
01:30:02.318 --> 01:30:03.903
I didn't work out.
I didn't do anything.

2125
01:30:03.945 --> 01:30:07.240
<i>* *</i>

2126
01:30:07.282 --> 01:30:10.118
- The only way he really knew
how to deal with it

2127
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:14.164
was to drown himself in liquor

2128
01:30:14.205 --> 01:30:17.167
and just get to the point

2129
01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.210
where he didn't
have to think about it.

2130
01:30:19.252 --> 01:30:20.754
- I've never seen
anything like it.

2131
01:30:20.795 --> 01:30:23.214
He. uh.

2132
01:30:23.256 --> 01:30:25.592
you know. enjoys drinking.

2133
01:30:25.633 --> 01:30:26.926
Um. but at this point.

2134
01:30:26.968 --> 01:30:28.720
it was from the time he woke up

2135
01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:30.430
to the time he went to bed.

2136
01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:33.475
He was just
in a really bad place.

2137
01:30:33.516 --> 01:30:35.769
<i>Like. he was not even</i>
<i>taking care of himself.</i>

2138
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:36.853
<i>He wasn't showering.</i>

2139
01:30:36.895 --> 01:30:38.563
<i>I mean. I just was like.</i>

2140
01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:40.690
<i>"I don't even know</i>
<i>who this man is."</i>

2141
01:30:41.483 --> 01:30:46.946
- I ended up calling WWE
and reporting him.

2142
01:30:46.988 --> 01:30:49.449
<i>and Hunter called me and said.</i>

2143
01:30:49.491 --> 01:30:52.160
<i>"Do we need to help him?"</i>
<i>I said. "Yes."</i>

2144
01:30:52.202 --> 01:30:54.037
<i>- Hunter calls me.</i>
<i>and he goes.</i>

2145
01:30:54.079 --> 01:30:55.914
"Hey. where are you?"

2146
01:30:55.955 --> 01:30:57.707
I said. "In my car."

2147
01:30:57.749 --> 01:30:59.834
"Turn around.
and go back to the airport."

2148
01:30:59.876 --> 01:31:01.294
"For what?"
Does he want--

2149
01:31:01.336 --> 01:31:02.879
I'm thinking
he wanted me to go to "Raw"

2150
01:31:02.921 --> 01:31:04.631
or something. right?

2151
01:31:04.673 --> 01:31:05.715
"You're going to rehab."

2152
01:31:05.757 --> 01:31:07.300
I said. "No. I'm not.

2153
01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:09.344
I'm not going to rehab."
He said. "Yes. you are.

2154
01:31:09.386 --> 01:31:11.388
You're gonna go to rehab.
or never work here again."

2155
01:31:12.555 --> 01:31:14.307
I go. "Oh. boy."

2156
01:31:14.349 --> 01:31:17.435
I got a six-pack
to go back to the airport--

2157
01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:19.354
drank it before I got there.

2158
01:31:19.396 --> 01:31:22.565
I had three hours
before the flight left.

2159
01:31:22.607 --> 01:31:24.109
I went into a bar there.

2160
01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:26.319
and I drank

2161
01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:30.824
ten double tequila
cranberry and soda--

2162
01:31:30.865 --> 01:31:31.991
ten doubles.

2163
01:31:32.033 --> 01:31:33.618
Right?

2164
01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.955
Got on airplane
and drank eight Bloody Marys

2165
01:31:36.996 --> 01:31:38.456
to Tampa.

2166
01:31:38.498 --> 01:31:42.335
got off the plane
and drank a six-pack.

2167
01:31:42.377 --> 01:31:45.255
and. uh. pulled into this place

2168
01:31:45.296 --> 01:31:47.382
at 2:00 in the morning.

2169
01:31:47.424 --> 01:31:49.634
I called Hunter and said.
"I don't need to be here."

2170
01:31:49.676 --> 01:31:51.678
He said. "Don't call me again.
Take his cell phone."

2171
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.930
[laughs]
And so--

2172
01:31:53.972 --> 01:31:54.889
- How long were you there?

2173
01:31:54.931 --> 01:31:56.766
- 35 days.

2174
01:31:56.808 --> 01:32:00.228
I got the coin.
I walked across the street...

2175
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:01.771
[chuckling]
And walked into a bar.

2176
01:32:01.813 --> 01:32:03.231
put it on a corner and said.

2177
01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:04.482
"I know
you won't take this for a beer.

2178
01:32:04.524 --> 01:32:07.235
so I'll give you 10 bucks."
[laughs]

2179
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:10.780
Had a Miller Lite
less than a block away.

2180
01:32:10.822 --> 01:32:11.948
Fuck you guys.

2181
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:13.533
[laughs]

2182
01:32:13.575 --> 01:32:15.201
Screw this shit.

2183

<i>* *</i>

2184
01:32:22.292 --> 01:32:23.752

01:32:23.793 --> 01:32:25.253
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

2188
01:32:30.717 --> 01:32:34.220
<i>I was in China.</i>
<i>Wendy called and was like.</i>

2189
01:32:34.262 --> 01:32:36.431
"Your dad's sick.
You need to go home."

2190
01:32:36.473 --> 01:32:37.932
- I get a call.
I had my phone there.

2191
01:32:37.974 --> 01:32:39.392
and he's downstairs.
He's like.

2192
01:32:39.434 --> 01:32:41.353
"Wendy. something's not--
something's wrong."

2193
01:32:41.394 --> 01:32:43.021
Um. you know.
"We gotta go to the hospital."

2194
01:32:43.063 --> 01:32:44.731
<i>I'm like.</i>
<i>"What are you talking about?"</i>

2195
01:32:44.773 --> 01:32:46.107
<i>He's like. "I don't feel good.</i>
<i>Something's not right."</i>

2196
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:48.193
and he's just. like. vomiting.

2197
01:32:48.234 --> 01:32:49.235
like. green stuff.

2198
01:32:49.277 --> 01:32:53.365
<i>* *</i>

2199
01:32:53.406 --> 01:32:54.574
<i>- They took me</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

2200
01:32:54.616 --> 01:32:56.785
<i>and no matter what they did.</i>

2201
01:32:56.826 --> 01:32:58.912
Wendy said
they could hear me screaming.

2202
01:32:58.953 --> 01:33:00.288
I don't remember any of it.

2203
01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:01.581
- They immediately
take him back.

2204
01:33:01.623 --> 01:33:04.084
and they say
it's his intestines.

2205
01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:05.752
but then they go.
"Wait a minute.

2206
01:33:05.794 --> 01:33:07.796
His heart's failing.
His kidneys are failing."

2207
01:33:07.837 --> 01:33:10.048
Like. all of a sudden. his
whole body was shutting down.

2208
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:11.591
and he's in severe pain.

2209
01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:13.426
Like. we're. like.
talking massive pain.

2210
01:33:13.468 --> 01:33:15.720
<i>and Ric never feels pain.</i>

2211
01:33:15.762 --> 01:33:17.472
<i>So I'm thinking.</i>
<i>"There's something wrong."</i>

2212
01:33:17.514 --> 01:33:20.266
<i>- Ruptured intestine.</i>
<i>pneumonia--</i>

2213
01:33:20.308 --> 01:33:22.060
septic was the worst part--

2214
01:33:22.102 --> 01:33:23.853
total kidney failure.

2215
01:33:23.895 --> 01:33:26.981
and. uh. respiratory failure

2216
01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:28.733
all at once.

2217
01:33:28.775 --> 01:33:30.568
- The doctors come in.
and they said.

2218
01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:32.612
<i>"He's slipping into a coma.</i>

2219
01:33:32.654 --> 01:33:34.656
<i>We're gonna have</i>
<i>to do surgery right away."</i>

2220
01:33:34.698 --> 01:33:39.494
<i>I called Hunter.</i>
<i>Ashley. Megan. and David.</i>

2221
01:33:39.536 --> 01:33:42.831
- I drove.
and it was about four hours.

2222
01:33:42.872 --> 01:33:45.959
and when I got there.
he was not intubated yet.

2223
01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:48.044
So he--I don't know.

2224
01:33:48.086 --> 01:33:49.879
I maybe got five minutes
with him.

2225
01:33:49.921 --> 01:33:51.297
- The nurses were explaining

2226
01:33:51.339 --> 01:33:54.509
to me. my sister.
and my brother.

2227
01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:56.428
you know.
that my dad might not make it.

2228
01:33:58.513 --> 01:34:00.890
Again. you go into. like.

2229
01:34:00.932 --> 01:34:02.017
<i>self-preservation.</i>

2230
01:34:02.058 --> 01:34:05.395
<i>You go into survival mode.</i>

2231
01:34:05.437 --> 01:34:10.233
<i>I could not. like.</i>
<i>mentally process that.</i>

2232
01:34:10.275 --> 01:34:12.027
They gave us. like.
all an opportunity

2233
01:34:12.068 --> 01:34:14.320
to say goodbye to him.

2234
01:34:14.362 --> 01:34:15.989
- They said.
"There's probably

2235
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:19.034
about 15% chance he's gonna
make it through this."

2236
01:34:19.075 --> 01:34:20.827
and they wheeled him away.

2237
01:34:20.869 --> 01:34:23.538
- I just sat on the floor
outside the ICU room

2238
01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.999
and just sat there crying.

2239
01:34:26.041 --> 01:34:29.044
- Everybody was worried.

2240
01:34:29.085 --> 01:34:31.421
You're talking about trending
number one worldwide.

2241
01:34:31.463 --> 01:34:33.590
Everyone was prayers up
for Ric Flair.

2242
01:34:33.631 --> 01:34:35.216
- We wanna pass on our best

2243
01:34:35.258 --> 01:34:36.760
to former pro wrestler
Ric Flair.

2244
01:34:36.801 --> 01:34:38.720
who remains
in critical condition.

2245
01:34:38.762 --> 01:34:41.806
<i>- The 68-year-old's agent said</i>
<i>he does have a long road</i>

2246
01:34:41.848 --> 01:34:43.350
<i>to recovery.</i>

2247
01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:45.018
<i>- He was in a coma.</i>

2248
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:47.187
I was with him for 31 days.
just sitting there.

2249
01:34:47.228 --> 01:34:48.688
They set me up
a little corner bed.

2250
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:52.484
and I just--that was my home.

2251
01:34:52.525 --> 01:34:54.486
<i>He. um. came out of the coma.</i>

2252
01:34:54.527 --> 01:34:56.946
<i>He was delusional.</i>

2253
01:34:56.988 --> 01:34:58.281
<i>- He was out of it.</i>

2254
01:34:58.323 --> 01:35:00.700
<i>He didn't recognize people.</i>

2255
01:35:00.742 --> 01:35:03.036
He was. like. telling me
to go to Taco Bell.

2256
01:35:03.078 --> 01:35:04.621
and telling Ashley to go.

2257
01:35:04.662 --> 01:35:06.873
I mean.
it was just really random.

2258
01:35:06.915 --> 01:35:09.751
- In the hospital. he was
going through massive detox...

2259
01:35:11.586 --> 01:35:14.923
<i>Shaking--</i>
<i>I mean. violently shaking.</i>

2260
01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:18.301
<i>We're talking a man</i>
<i>who was drinking</i>

2261
01:35:18.343 --> 01:35:20.970
<i>about 30 or 40 vodkas a day.</i>

2262
01:35:21.012 --> 01:35:23.390
<i>* *</i>

2263
01:35:23.431 --> 01:35:26.226
- I mean.
he's had other health issues.

2264
01:35:26.267 --> 01:35:28.353
really minor health issues.

2265
01:35:28.395 --> 01:35:32.148
but nothing
that would've led to--to that.

2266
01:35:32.190 --> 01:35:33.608
So it's just kind of all...

2267
01:35:35.610 --> 01:35:37.237
It's from drinking.

2268
01:35:37.278 --> 01:35:38.405
- It was a tough room.

2269
01:35:38.446 --> 01:35:39.739
You know. this one dude's
in one corner.

2270
01:35:39.781 --> 01:35:41.574
and his daughter's
in the other. and...

2271
01:35:41.616 --> 01:35:43.368
I was sitting there.
just holding his hand.

2272
01:35:43.410 --> 01:35:46.913
just. you know. talking to him.

2273
01:35:46.955 --> 01:35:48.873
And...

2274
01:35:48.915 --> 01:35:50.417
he would open his eyes.
looked up. and he went.

2275
01:35:50.458 --> 01:35:51.584
"Hogan. Hogan.

2276
01:35:51.626 --> 01:35:52.794
go get me a six-pack."

2277
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.171
And I looked at him.
and I said.

2278
01:35:55.213 --> 01:35:56.256
"Are you out of your mind?"

2279
01:35:56.297 --> 01:35:58.758
<i>* *</i>

2280
01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.261
<i>- How long were you</i>
<i>in the hospital?</i>

2281
01:36:01.302 --> 01:36:03.763
- 32 days. ICU.

2282
01:36:03.805 --> 01:36:06.099
and then I was
in a rehab facility

2283
01:36:06.141 --> 01:36:08.393
for another 30 days.

2284
01:36:08.435 --> 01:36:10.228
learning how to walk.

2285
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:13.356
I'd gone from 240 to 202.

2286
01:36:13.398 --> 01:36:15.608
I lost 40 pounds.

2287
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:16.985
I had no strength at all.

2288
01:36:17.027 --> 01:36:19.446
I could not pop a top
off a Diet Coke.

2289
01:36:21.573 --> 01:36:23.908
Isn't that amazing?

2290
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:25.035
<i>They thought that was</i>
<i>because of drinking.</i>

2291
01:36:25.076 --> 01:36:26.244
<i>It wasn't at all--</i>

2292
01:36:26.286 --> 01:36:28.329
<i>because of bowel obstruction.</i>

2293
01:36:29.664 --> 01:36:31.291
<i>- And it's an amazing thing</i>

2294
01:36:31.332 --> 01:36:34.502
to be able to ask
somebody this question

2295
01:36:34.544 --> 01:36:39.299
multiple seasons
and moments in his life.

2296
01:36:39.341 --> 01:36:41.301
Why did you survive?

2297
01:36:41.343 --> 01:36:42.469
- I don't know.

2298
01:36:48.183 --> 01:36:49.392
Why am I here?

2299
01:36:50.852 --> 01:36:51.853
Strange.

2300
01:36:55.565 --> 01:36:56.858
But like I said.

2301
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:59.069
after you've gone
through something like that.

2302
01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:02.113
you just need--
it's very important.

2303
01:37:02.155 --> 01:37:05.784
I think. to let people
that you care about

2304
01:37:05.825 --> 01:37:08.244
know how much
you care about 'em.

2305
01:37:08.286 --> 01:37:12.957
- What did it mean to you
that your daughters were there?

2306
01:37:12.999 --> 01:37:14.501
- Everything.

2307
01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:16.127
Ashley came from China.

2308
01:37:18.213 --> 01:37:20.215
<i>It took her 22 hours</i>
<i>to get there.</i>

2309
01:37:20.256 --> 01:37:22.509
<i>* *</i>

2310
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:24.344
<i>Between Ashley</i>
<i>and Megan and Wendy.</i>

2311
01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:26.262
<i>how do I ever forget that?</i>

2312
01:37:26.304 --> 01:37:27.430
- We have good news tonight.

2313
01:37:27.472 --> 01:37:29.599
WWE star and Atlanta favorite
Ric Flair

2314
01:37:29.641 --> 01:37:30.975
is out of the hospital.

2315
01:37:31.017 --> 01:37:32.852
- How's he doing?
- He's doing much better.

2316
01:37:32.894 --> 01:37:34.479
<i>To be honest.</i>
<i>it's a miracle.</i>

2317
01:37:34.521 --> 01:37:36.523
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>to all my fans out there.</i>

2318
01:37:36.564 --> 01:37:39.818
let it be known worldwide
that Nature Boy--

2319
01:37:39.859 --> 01:37:41.820
woo!
Is back up and running.

2320
01:37:41.861 --> 01:37:43.613
looking as only I can look.

2321
01:37:43.655 --> 01:37:45.740
I wanna tell
all my fans out there.

2322
01:37:45.782 --> 01:37:47.992
thank you
for all the love. support.

2323
01:37:48.034 --> 01:37:49.536
and I will see you

2324
01:37:49.577 --> 01:37:53.164
in the very. very. very.
very. very. very

2325
01:37:53.206 --> 01:37:54.165
near future.

2326
01:37:54.207 --> 01:37:55.875
Woo!

2327
01:37:55.917 --> 01:37:58.878
<i>- When Ric got out of ICU.</i>
<i>it took about 18 months</i>

2328
01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.172
<i>from ICU on. where he started</i>

2329
01:38:01.214 --> 01:38:03.925
to feel like he wanted
to be the life of the party.

2330
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.846
- Given what
you'd been through.

2331
01:38:07.887 --> 01:38:10.015
why drink?

2332
01:38:10.056 --> 01:38:11.558
- Because I enjoy it.

2333
01:38:14.519 --> 01:38:16.396
Why play golf?

2334
01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:18.023
Why drive my boat?

2335
01:38:18.064 --> 01:38:20.400
After I work out.
there's nothing to do--

2336
01:38:20.442 --> 01:38:22.861
Just waiting for 5:00.

2337
01:38:22.902 --> 01:38:25.071
I'm on a time frame.
5:00.

2338
01:38:25.113 --> 01:38:26.781
Ultra--Michelob Ultra
till 7:00.

2339
01:38:26.823 --> 01:38:30.076
Vodka. Ketel One soda.

2340
01:38:30.118 --> 01:38:33.288
cranberry. and a lime.

2341
01:38:33.329 --> 01:38:34.664
and at 8:00. red wine

2342
01:38:34.706 --> 01:38:36.583
till 10:00--
upstairs to bed.

2343
01:38:38.501 --> 01:38:39.627
Sometimes alone.

2344
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:42.255
sometimes with...

2345
01:38:42.297 --> 01:38:43.965
company.
[laughs]

2346
01:38:45.467 --> 01:38:47.802
I'm a guy that's gonna go
over and...

2347
01:38:47.844 --> 01:38:49.971
meet somebody
and have fun again tonight.

2348
01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.100
<i>- In his late 60s.</i>

2349
01:38:54.142 --> 01:38:57.228
<i>he'd somehow</i>
<i>cheated death yet again.</i>

2350
01:38:57.270 --> 01:39:00.231
<i>The Nature Boy character</i>
<i>had become his legacy.</i>

2351
01:39:00.273 --> 01:39:03.610
<i>and it began impacting</i>
<i>the music industry.</i>

2352
01:39:03.651 --> 01:39:06.112
<i>There were songs</i>
<i>written about him.</i>

2353
01:39:06.154 --> 01:39:08.698
<i>The lifestyle.</i>
<i>the bling. the drip--</i>

2354
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.533
<i>it was pervasive.</i>

2355
01:39:10.575 --> 01:39:14.537
<i>Singers. musicians.</i>
<i>the rap world--</i>

2356
01:39:14.579 --> 01:39:16.206
<i>they couldn't seem</i>
<i>to get enough</i>

2357
01:39:16.247 --> 01:39:17.707
<i>of Ric Flair.</i>

2358
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.504
- Ladies and gentlemen--
- Capture this on film.

2359
01:39:22.545 --> 01:39:25.256
- To the great Post Malone!

2360
01:39:25.298 --> 01:39:29.094
Took the time
out of his very busy schedule

2361
01:39:29.135 --> 01:39:33.181

2362

to visit me...
- Woo!

2363
01:39:34.766 --> 01:39:37.310
- When I had just gotten out
of the hospital.

2364
01:39:37.352 --> 01:39:39.562
I couldn't drink then.

Ric Flair!

2419

right now.

2421

You gotta look

01:41:59.494 --> 01:42:00.620
that Ric Flair has.

2433
01:42:00.662 --> 01:42:02.914
- He's kind of become a. uh.

01:42:02.956 --> 01:42:04.874

2435
01:42:04.916 --> 01:42:06.793

"How the hell

2439
01:42:12.215 --> 01:42:15.802

blinging.

01:42:15.844 --> 01:42:17.429
private jet-flying.

01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:18.388

He's here.
He's there.

He's wrestling.
He's on car commercials.

- Woo!

2447
01:42:29.566 --> 01:42:32.527
- The guy's pushing
just as hard as he ever did.

2448
01:42:32.569 --> 01:42:34.029
So he's not done yet.

2449
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:36.031
- I've certainly had
my problems along the way.

2450
01:42:36.072 --> 01:42:37.949
but I'm on my feet now.

2451
01:42:37.991 --> 01:42:40.493
and. uh.
probably in the best position

2452
01:42:40.535 --> 01:42:42.078
I've ever been in--

2453
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:45.498

2459
01:43:00.263 --> 01:43:01.264

<i>And shows no signs</i>
<i>of slowing down.</i>

<i>eight. nine. a hundred.</i>

2466
01:43:16.821 --> 01:43:19.657
<i>- Working and grinding.</i>

<i>and so is Ric Flair.</i>

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>-It's a weird job.</i>
<i>and weird people do this.</i>

2476

It either gets ahold of you.
or it doesn't.

2477
01:43:44.474 --> 01:43:46.976
and it's--it's sometimes hard
to walk away from it.

2478
01:43:47.018 --> 01:43:48.853
- We did two Monday nights.

2479
01:43:48.895 --> 01:43:51.981
and then I found out I'm going
to Saudi again in four weeks.

2480
01:43:53.191 --> 01:43:57.195
- It's hard to walk away.
because some of us--

2481
01:43:57.237 --> 01:44:00.281
this is our life.
It's in our blood.

2482
01:44:00.323 --> 01:44:04.661
<i>- Father Time or Mother Nature</i>
<i>is undefeated.</i>

2483
01:44:04.703 --> 01:44:06.121
<i>and that's hard.</i>

2484
01:44:06.162 --> 01:44:09.082
<i>because you wanna hold on.</i>

2485
01:44:09.124 --> 01:44:11.668
<i>It's not even to the noise</i>
<i>of the crowd.</i>

2486
01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:14.170
<i>It's to the youth</i>
<i>that came along with it.</i>

2487
01:44:14.212 --> 01:44:16.256
<i>But it doesn't matter</i>
<i>how old he gets.</i>

2488
01:44:16.297 --> 01:44:18.341
Whatever that is.
that it that he has.

2489
01:44:18.383 --> 01:44:20.218
that umph--it never leaves him.

2490
01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.804
- Oh!

01:44:22.846 --> 01:44:24.014
Woo!

But on the other hand.

2496
01:44:31.104 --> 01:44:33.773
I hope. deep down.

2497
01:44:33.815 --> 01:44:34.941
that he doesn't feel like

2498
01:44:34.983 --> 01:44:36.776
he has anything left to prove.

2499
01:44:36.818 --> 01:44:40.113
<i>- Ric's whole life</i>
<i>is about proving himself</i>

2500
01:44:40.155 --> 01:44:42.240
<i>and earning respect.</i>

2501
01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:45.201
I think. in some ways.

2502
01:44:45.243 --> 01:44:47.370
um. in his life story.

2503
01:44:47.412 --> 01:44:49.247
<i>it was constantly</i>
<i>about earning that respect.</i>

2504
01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:51.624
<i>and then he gets</i>
<i>into the business.</i>

2505
01:44:51.666 --> 01:44:53.043
<i>and everything about him</i>

2506
01:44:53.084 --> 01:44:54.794
is about earning
everybody's respect.

2507
01:44:54.836 --> 01:44:56.296
<i>- It's tough being a legend.</i>

2508
01:44:56.338 --> 01:44:58.506
<i>It's tough being a folk hero.</i>

2509
01:44:58.548 --> 01:45:02.344
It's tough making
a million dollars a year!

2510
01:45:02.385 --> 01:45:05.930
- What is Ric Flair's legacy?

2511
01:45:05.972 --> 01:45:07.724
Two words--

2512
01:45:07.766 --> 01:45:08.725
<i>the man.</i>

2513
01:45:08.767 --> 01:45:09.893

<i>- Simple.</i>

<i>* *</i>

2516
01:45:13.104 --> 01:45:16.024
<i>- The 16-time World Champion.</i>

2517
01:45:16.066 --> 01:45:19.694
<i>the greatest of all time.</i>

2518
01:45:19.736 --> 01:45:23.490
<i>- He will be the greatest</i>
<i>wrestler of all time.</i>

2519
01:45:23.531 --> 01:45:26.076
because he is.

2520
01:45:26.117 --> 01:45:28.745
There's nobody else.

2521
01:45:28.787 --> 01:45:31.664
<i>- I don't know that he'll</i>
<i>ever. you know. truly grasp</i>

2522
01:45:31.706 --> 01:45:34.459
<i>and appreciate</i>
<i>the influence that he's had.</i>

2523
01:45:36.127 --> 01:45:37.337
<i>But I think he understands it</i>

2524
01:45:37.379 --> 01:45:39.547
far better now
than he once did.

2525
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:42.258
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

2526
01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.177
<i>- I do a lot</i>
<i>of public speaking now.</i>

2527
01:45:44.219 --> 01:45:47.263
I can be even in a big church.

2528
01:45:47.305 --> 01:45:48.932
and I'll just mention the name.
"Ric Flair."

2529
01:45:48.973 --> 01:45:50.433
and they all go. "Woo!"

2530
01:45:50.475 --> 01:45:52.268
All those deacons in front row
at church.

2531
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:53.770
with their suit and ties on.

2532
01:45:53.812 --> 01:45:55.063
they're wooing.

2533
01:45:55.105 --> 01:45:57.357
I just mention Ric's name.

2534
01:45:57.399 --> 01:46:00.443
<i>- There is no one</i>
<i>in this entire industry</i>

2535
01:46:00.485 --> 01:46:04.114
<i>that is more respected</i>
<i>than Ric Flair.</i>

2536
01:46:04.155 --> 01:46:10.203
<i>* *</i>

2537
01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:17.502
- Richard Fliehr. the man--
he's more caring.

2538
01:46:17.544 --> 01:46:20.797
<i>He's more of a kind person.</i>

2539
01:46:20.839 --> 01:46:24.217
<i>and he wants to be loved</i>

2540
01:46:24.259 --> 01:46:26.970
<i>and cared for</i>
<i>and taken care of.</i>

2541
01:46:27.012 --> 01:46:29.222
and everybody
just sucks him out

2542
01:46:29.264 --> 01:46:31.641
to be this. like. character.

2543
01:46:31.683 --> 01:46:35.478
They won't allow him
to be a normal. good person.

2544
01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.272
- I didn't feel good
last week...

2545
01:46:37.313 --> 01:46:40.066
[chuckling] and Wendy said.
"You've got anxiety

2546
01:46:40.108 --> 01:46:41.735
about going to 'Raw.'"

2547
01:46:41.776 --> 01:46:44.529
I said. "No. I have anxiety
about being alive."

2548
01:46:44.571 --> 01:46:46.948
People keep reminding me
that I should be dead.

2549
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:49.200
- He has a great relationship
with his granddaughter.

2550
01:46:49.242 --> 01:46:50.827
He spoils her.

2551
01:46:50.869 --> 01:46:53.038
I think she was. like. ten.
and he bought her a cell phone.

2552
01:46:53.079 --> 01:46:54.372
and I was like. "Dad. she--"
he's like.

2553
01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:55.665
"Well. I need a way
to call her.

2554
01:46:55.707 --> 01:46:57.125
"I'm gonna call her.
She needs to call her papa

2555
01:46:57.167 --> 01:46:58.168
"when she needs him.

2556
01:46:58.209 --> 01:47:00.295
She's calling her papa."

2557
01:47:00.337 --> 01:47:03.631
<i>- Is there a person</i>
<i>that isn't Ric Flair?</i>

2558
01:47:03.673 --> 01:47:05.175
<i>Well. yes. Dad.</i>

2559
01:47:05.216 --> 01:47:06.634
<i>but Dad still...</i>

2560
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:11.097
Has Ric Flair-isms.

2561
01:47:11.139 --> 01:47:13.975
[chuckling] Like. he still woos
at the end of the phone call.

2562
01:47:14.017 --> 01:47:15.101
- Woo!

2563
01:47:15.143 --> 01:47:16.644
<i>- [laughs]</i>

2564
01:47:16.686 --> 01:47:18.313
<i>I don't look at it</i>
<i>as Ric Flair.</i>

2565
01:47:18.355 --> 01:47:20.023
<i>I look at it as Dad.</i>

2566
01:47:20.065 --> 01:47:23.026
<i>like. and how's he wired.</i>

2567
01:47:23.068 --> 01:47:26.029
<i>and what makes him him.</i>

2568
01:47:26.071 --> 01:47:27.989
- How is your health overall?

2569
01:47:28.031 --> 01:47:29.157
- Phenomenal.

2570
01:47:30.992 --> 01:47:32.160
Phenomenal.

2571
01:47:33.828 --> 01:47:34.746
I don't hurt anywhere.

2572
01:47:36.331 --> 01:47:37.332
I don't hurt anywhere--

2573
01:47:37.374 --> 01:47:39.417
no knees. back. nothing.

2574
01:47:39.459 --> 01:47:42.629
<i>Who would've ever thought</i>
<i>I'd be sitting here again?</i>

2575
01:47:42.671 --> 01:47:46.216
- How would you define
"identity"?

2576
01:47:46.257 --> 01:47:48.051
- I would say
identifying yourself

2577
01:47:48.093 --> 01:47:50.136
as waking up in the morning

2578
01:47:50.178 --> 01:47:51.346
and...

2579
01:47:53.598 --> 01:47:56.476
And--and
feeling good about yourself.

2580
01:47:56.518 --> 01:47:59.312
which hasn't happened to me

2581
01:47:59.354 --> 01:48:00.480
in my whole life.

2582
01:48:01.564 --> 01:48:03.233
- Why?

2583
01:48:04.567 --> 01:48:06.277
- Um.

2584
01:48:06.319 --> 01:48:08.238
I don't know.

2585
01:48:08.279 --> 01:48:11.408
Because I--I definitely
am aware of the fact

2586
01:48:11.449 --> 01:48:13.952
I made some bad choices
in life.

2587
01:48:13.993 --> 01:48:15.120
and. uh...

2588
01:48:17.455 --> 01:48:18.581
But I've never done anything

2589
01:48:18.623 --> 01:48:20.583
to intentionally hurt anybody.

2590
01:48:20.625 --> 01:48:22.085
I've lived in a world
of embellishment

2591
01:48:22.127 --> 01:48:23.586
for my whole life.

2592
01:48:23.628 --> 01:48:25.714
But when I'm telling--
everything I've told you today

2593
01:48:25.755 --> 01:48:27.382
is the God-honest truth.

2594
01:48:27.424 --> 01:48:29.592
It doesn't mean I can explain
how it happened or what.

2595
01:48:29.634 --> 01:48:32.137
but everything I'm telling you
is the God-honest truth.

2596
01:48:32.178 --> 01:48:35.098
Woo!

2597
01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:38.309
- Who is Richard Fliehr?

2598
01:48:38.351 --> 01:48:39.728
- I don't know.

2599
01:48:39.769 --> 01:48:41.980
The luckiest--he's
the luckiest guy in the world.

2600
01:48:42.022 --> 01:48:44.858
<i>who had been raised</i>
<i>by his mom and dad.</i>

2601
01:48:44.899 --> 01:48:47.152
<i>and who had a chance</i>
<i>to become Ric Flair</i>

2602
01:48:47.193 --> 01:48:48.611
<i>for good or for bad.</i>

2603
01:48:48.653 --> 01:48:51.448
From the lightning
to the plane crash.

2604
01:48:51.489 --> 01:48:54.200
<i>being on top of the business.</i>

2605
01:48:54.242 --> 01:48:56.911
<i>that's who</i>
<i>Richard Fliehr was:</i>

2606
01:48:56.953 --> 01:48:59.289
<i>the luckiest</i>
<i>son of a bitch alive.</i>

2607
01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:01.833
<i>Everything I said on TV.</i>
<i>I lived.</i>

2608
01:49:01.875 --> 01:49:03.209
I mean.

2609
01:49:03.251 --> 01:49:04.627
that's why
it probably comes across

2610
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:06.129
and why it's so memorable now.

2611
01:49:06.171 --> 01:49:09.382
It's because I was doing it.

2612
01:49:09.424 --> 01:49:11.551
I'm doing it now.

2613
01:49:11.593 --> 01:49:14.429
I'm sitting here and wearing
a $6.000-custom-made suit

2614
01:49:14.471 --> 01:49:16.765
just for you.
for the interview.

2615

[chuckles]

2616
01:49:18.266 --> 01:49:20.101
Who does that?
Ric Flair.

2617
01:49:20.143 --> 01:49:21.853
[laughs]

2618
01:49:26.441 --> 01:49:28.818
<i>- There's a Richard.</i>

2619
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.403

2620

- Terrible.
