00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.375
-I'm Beverly. Jason's fiancée.
-Mm-hmm.

513
00:26:38.458 --> 00:26:40.166
-Erica.
-Nice to meet you.

514
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.833
-Uh--
-She and Jason--

515
00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:44.166
-Yeah. we-- this. uh--
-You know each other from New York?

516
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.083
-Right.
-Yeah. I see you know Christian. too.

517
00:26:46.166 --> 00:26:47.208
Hmm.

518
00:26:47.291 --> 00:26:49.916
-[chuckles]
-We all used to live in the same building.

519
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.375
Yes! We got to know each other from. uh…
[splutters] …when it was the club.

520
00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:55.458
[Christian spluttering]

521
00:26:55.541 --> 00:26:57.250
-[Jason] Yeah. Yeah.
-A club?

522
00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:59.458
-Yeah. it was a--
-Right. it wasn't really a dance club.

523
00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:01.958
No. It was-- It was--
It was a-- It was a book club.

524
00:27:02.458 --> 00:27:03.416
-Yeah.
-[Christian] Yeah.

525
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.791
What luck running into Erica.

526
00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:08.375
You don't often find employees
in the lobby unless they are working.

527
00:27:08.458 --> 00:27:09.875
It's such a treat that you're here.

528
00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:12.875
I never get to meet Jason's friends.
'cause you guys are all up in New York.

529
00:27:12.958 --> 00:27:15.791
And we've been so swamped.
Can't get out of Charleston…

530
00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.666
-[chuckles]
-Oh. right. You moved to Charleston.

531
00:27:19.708 --> 00:27:21.625
I was the first person he met
when he moved there.

532
00:27:21.708 --> 00:27:23.250
right across the hall from me.

533
00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:25.666
Wow. first person. huh?

534
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.166
-Wasn't that. like. a year ago?
-[chuckles nervously]

535
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.250
But didn't give you a lot of time
to plan a wedding. huh?

536
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:33.666
-Ha!
-No. he didn't. But I-- I don't need it.

537
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.875
We just wanted it to be really intimate.
So. for me. that's me. my sister Janelle.

538
00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:39.416
and. uh. Jason's parents are coming.
a few of our friends.

539
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.375
but that's it. That's all we needed.

540
00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:43.166
That is so sweet.

541
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.166
Hey. um. why don't you take. uh. Janelle
to the spa.

542
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.166
and I'll come meet you
for cell regeneration time.

543
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.750
-[Beverly] Thank you.
-[both kiss]

544
00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:54.500
Okay. okay. yes.
it was so good to meet you.

545
00:27:54.583 --> 00:27:57.125
Come on. Janelle. wanna show me
your secret plans for the weekend?

546
00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.625
-Okay. bye. Okay. bye.
-Bye.

547
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.041
[Beverly giggles]

548
00:28:01.125 --> 00:28:01.958
How could you?

549
00:28:02.666 --> 00:28:05.083
[grunts]
I can't believe you're getting married.

550
00:28:05.166 --> 00:28:06.458
I can't believe you're here!

551
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:08.500
What are you even--
What are you doing here?

552
00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:11.166
Amber does social media for this resort.

553
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.291
They needed a singer.

554
00:28:12.375 --> 00:28:14.833
No wonder I kept gettin' ads
about this place.

555
00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:17.208
Wait. What happened with Cre
and the album?

556
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:19.458
Cre scrapped it.

557
00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:23.208
Someone leaked one of the tracks.
and he just destroyed the whole thing.

558
00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:24.541
along with my career.

559
00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:27.583
Yeah. I'm sorry.

560
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:29.750
I didn't know.

561
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.416
Yeah. me too.

562
00:28:33.791 --> 00:28:37.000
But if Beverly finds out we were engaged.
it'll cause so many problems.

563
00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:39.833
-So please just--
-Wait. she doesn't know?

564
00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:43.333
[spluttering] I could--
I could never seem to find the right time.

565
00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:46.291
You know. I guess it's never really
a good time to tell your new fiancée

566
00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:49.291
how you walked out on your old fiancée
a month before the wedding.

567
00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:51.208
Wait a minute.
I didn't walk out on you. okay?

568
00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:54.583
You walked out every single day
to the studio.

569
00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:57.458
And you know what? By the time
the job offer came up in Charleston.

570
00:28:57.541 --> 00:28:59.416
there wasn't a relationship
to even walk out on.

571
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.333
What? So you leave without talking to me.
and I'm the bad guy?

572
00:29:02.416 --> 00:29:04.083
Listen. you were never there to--

573
00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:07.541
-You know what? Rehashing this--
-[scoffs] Rehash?

574
00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:10.291
[chuckles] Oh no. You know--
You know what? It was never hashed.

575
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:11.625
You were just gone.

576
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.000
Okay. [claps hands]

577
00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:13.958
[chuckles]

578
00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:16.833
I did not do 48 hours
of therapy for this. okay?

579
00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:18.125
-[inhales deeply]
-Hmm.

580
00:29:18.208 --> 00:29:19.708
-We're here for a few days.
-Mm-hmm.

581
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.458
We can avoid each other. Easy.

582
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:23.791
Yeah. mm-hmm. Don't expect me to sing
at your wedding.

583
00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:26.291
Good. I don't. Tell 'em you're sick
or something. Call in.

584
00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:28.750
-I will gladly do that.
-Well. good!

585
00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:33.541
-But you won't tell Beverly. right?
-[yells] Go. go. go. go!

586
00:29:33.625 --> 00:29:34.458
[sighs]

587
00:29:37.083 --> 00:29:38.708
-[Barrington] Morning.
-[screams]

588
00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:41.250
-Hi.
-[sighs]

589
00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:43.333
Did you just hear that?

590
00:29:43.416 --> 00:29:46.666
[spluttering] There's an echo in here.
so. uh. I heard it.

591
00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:48.208
Twice.

592
00:29:49.333 --> 00:29:51.500
I guess you know now why I hate weddings.

593
00:29:51.583 --> 00:29:53.708
Erica. why didn't you just tell us?

594
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.375
[sighs]

595
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.750
I didn't want to relive it.

596
00:30:01.583 --> 00:30:04.375
[Christian laughing]

597
00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:12.750
-Does she really work here?
-Dude. Amber does--

598
00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:14.875
It's not funny. man!

599
00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:17.041
-What are you gonna tell Beverly?
-[Jason] Nothin'.

600
00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:20.541
Beverly finds out I was engaged
to Erica. she will lose it.

601
00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.500
Okay. then. you gotta come clean.
Look. if you get caught lyin'--

602
00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:25.125
Okay. listen. I know you mean well.

603
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:27.750
but I don't need the Honor-Duty
Captain America speech right now.

604
00:30:27.833 --> 00:30:29.750
-Wow. Captain America?
-Okay?

605
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:32.375
Wasn't Special Forces.

606
00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:33.500
Ooh.

607
00:30:33.583 --> 00:30:34.583
All I'm sayin'

608
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:38.833
is perfect honesty isn't always possible
in 24-7 civilian life.

609
00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:40.041
Hmm. yep.

610
00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:42.416
And no one is expecting you to be perfect.

611
00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:45.291
just honest.

612
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:49.208
And sometimes. keeping things to yourself
is the best way to go.

613
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.625
[sighs]

614
00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:54.958
Otherwise.
I'll end up with two ex-fiancées.

615
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:58.958
I wonder if I should try
for a wedding commission from the hotel

616
00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:00.708
since they found it through me.

617
00:31:01.208 --> 00:31:02.875
-Amber!
-I'm sorry.

618
00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:04.875
This is not about business.

619
00:31:04.958 --> 00:31:08.083
Look. I'll-- I'll conveniently come down
with a cold the day of his wedding.

620
00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.541
In the meantime.
we'll just avoid each other.

621
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.333
What? This is a good. sane plan.

622
00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:17.000
Look. I gotta get ready for work.

623
00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:19.916
It's a big resort. It can't be that hard.

624
00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:24.291
Erica! Girl. hey! [chuckles]

625
00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:25.916
Fancy runnin' into you.

626
00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:27.666
Yes. [chuckles]

627
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.583
You know. it's-- it's too bad.
I'm actually running late for. um…

628
00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:34.083
The meeting about the music.
the wedding music?

629
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.000
Right. That's right now.

630
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:39.541
-Yes. right now.
-Yes. girl. come on. We'll go find Jason.

631
00:31:40.583 --> 00:31:43.958
He's around here somewhere.
It is such serendipity that you're here.

632
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:46.000
Yeah. That's definitely a word for it.

633
00:31:46.083 --> 00:31:49.416
I gotta tell you. I-- I was so worried
Jason was missing his life in New York.

634
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.125
so to have you here is just--

635
00:31:51.708 --> 00:31:54.500
[gasps] Oh. wait. you should come hiking
with us tomorrow.

636
00:31:54.583 --> 00:31:58.375
Oh no. You know. I'm--
I'm not much of a hiker. I-- Bad arches.

637
00:31:58.458 --> 00:32:00.041
Oh. no. girl. please. It'll be fun.

638
00:32:00.125 --> 00:32:03.958
We usually discourage employees
from fraternizing with the guests.

639
00:32:04.041 --> 00:32:06.208
Resort rules. Right. Sorry.

640
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:10.000
But guest wishes always come first.
and I would hate to put two friends apart.

641
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:11.291
Yes. thank you!

642
00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:14.583
-We-- We're more like book club members.
-No. Thank you.

643
00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.458
Bonne journée. Erica.

644
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.625
[footsteps receding]

645
00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:22.791
So. Beverly tells me you don't have
your wedding song yet? Really?

646
00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:24.833
Perhaps I can make a suggestion.

647
00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:26.041
-Oh please.
-Yeah?

648
00:32:26.125 --> 00:32:31.625
Okay. great. How about
"Unbreak My Heart" by Toni Braxton.

649
00:32:32.708 --> 00:32:35.500
-Uh. for a wedding?
-Mm. Mm-hmm. Yep.

650
00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:39.875
Or. what about "Irreplaceable" by Beyoncé?

651
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.250
[chuckles]
Uh. girl. that's a breakup song.

652
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:44.291
Mm.

653
00:32:44.375 --> 00:32:47.583
-I've always loved "Diamonds" by Rihanna.
-Yeah!

654
00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:49.416
-Mm.
-Yeah. I like that.

655
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.291
Wait! Wait!
You know what will be a really good one?

656
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:56.083
"No One" by Alicia Keys.

657
00:32:58.458 --> 00:32:59.416
-Yeah.
-[Jason] Yeah?

658
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:01.125
Why?

659
00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:03.916
Well. when you first moved in
across the hall from me.

660
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.875
you used to play that song on repeat.

661
00:33:05.958 --> 00:33:07.208
and so loud. [chuckles]

662
00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:10.208
I found myself humming it
before I met you. which…

663
00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:12.208
I don't know. feels like a sign.

664
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:13.250
-Does it?
-Yeah.

665
00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:17.208
'Cause. I kinda liked your first instinct.
Rihanna. "Diamonds." better.

666
00:33:17.291 --> 00:33:19.125
Aw. baby. you do?

667
00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:20.791
-Yeah.
-Mm.

668
00:33:23.375 --> 00:33:26.375
[giggling] So sweet. Oh…

669
00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:27.875
Yeah. Oh!

670
00:33:27.958 --> 00:33:32.166
So we're settled. We got our wedding song.
So. how many more of these we gotta pick?

671
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.708
Oh. do you mind if we. uh. pick the rest
on the hike tomorrow?

672
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:37.500
-Need to get some rest.
-Sure. Tomorrow's fine.

673
00:33:38.666 --> 00:33:42.416
-Wait. what? What-- What do you mean?
-Oh. I invited Erica to come hiking.

674
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.500
-You didn't? [chuckles]
-[Beverly] Yeah. I did.

to get used to the lizards. though.

-Hmm.
-[Beverly] Jason told me about that.

707

It's just awful.

and he wanted to settle down. have kids.

and I wasn't ready to walk away
from my dreams of becoming a singer.

development for the city council.

my dreams were to me.

726
00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:19.541
-[Beverly] Hmm.
-Or maybe he just didn't care.

727

Or maybe he thought your dreams were
way more important than he was.

If he was the love of her life.
he would have known.

that changed my entire life.

1179
01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:47.416
-I blew it out on my last mission.
-Oh.

1180
01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:51.208
And just like that.
the only life that I know-- I-- [sighs]

1181
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.416
I knew.

1182
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.541
really is gone.

1183
01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.500
Not many people
can see those types of scars.

1184
01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:02.625
Hmm. [chuckles] True.

1185
01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:08.041
I look at that scar and think to myself.
it has put me on a path.

1186
01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:10.041
and I don't know where it's gonna lead.

1187
01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:10.958
Hmm.

1188
01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:14.666
No one is coming to pick me up
to take me to my next mission.

1189
01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:20.625
And I keep imagining my family and…

1190
01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:22.208
[chuckles] …everyone…

1191
01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:26.458
expecting me to know
what I'm gonna do next. but…

1192
01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:28.500
I don't.

1193
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.208
And for the first time in my life. I have

1194
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:33.583
no plan.

1195
01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:38.375
Maybe you should own that.

1196
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.541
Yeah. Don't worry about
what everybody expects of you.

1197
01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.083
I don't know how to do that.

1198
01:03:47.166 --> 01:03:48.125
[both chuckle]

1199
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:49.541
Hmm.

1200
01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:51.708
Neither do I.

1201
01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:52.666
I guess.

1202
01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:59.166
[sighs] It's harder trying to get over
what you expect of yourself.

1203
01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:01.333
Yeah. that's the one.

1204
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:06.083
'Cause I definitely expected
that album would be my big break.

1205
01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:08.208
Hmm. [tsks]

1206
01:04:08.625 --> 01:04:09.875
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry.

1207
01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.166
I'm not sure that I am.

1208
01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:20.166
But I do know
that the music is still with me.

1209
01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.958
And though I have no plan…

1210
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.375
[sighs] …I know I'm meant to sing.

1211
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.916
That's why God gave me this voice.

1212
01:04:33.291 --> 01:04:36.458
Well. you can't argue with God.

1213
01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:38.041
No.

1214
01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:40.625
Especially not
when he makes a sunrise like that.

1215
01:04:45.333 --> 01:04:46.416
[Erica] Wow.

1216
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:49.458
Okay. I… [clears throat]
…should go get some sleep

1217
01:04:49.541 --> 01:04:50.875
before my parents get here.

1218
01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.958
Seeing my mom
for the first time in a few years

1219
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:55.416
requires at least four hours.

1220
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500
[chuckles] Oh wow.

1221
01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:01.958
-Um. I'm gonna go…
-Yeah.

1222
01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:02.875
…hide.

1223
01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:04.208
See you later.

1224
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:07.083
-Before your mom sees me. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

1225
01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:09.500
-Then the sand's gonna hit the fan.
-[chuckles]

1226
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:11.375
-All right.
-Yeah.

1227
01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:12.708
-Good night!
-See you later.

1228
01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:13.833
-Bye.
-Bye.

1229

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:29.708
[Naomi] Hmm.

1232
01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:32.666
Mm-hmm.

1233

[chuckles nervously]

1234
01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:37.791
I've got to be real.

1235
01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:40.291
Today's a very difficult day for me.

1236
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:42.541
I'm losing my baby.

1237
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.500
My blanket in the shade.

1238
01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:45.958
Oh. Mom!

1239
01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:49.583
I used to use his little body
as a shawl on picnics.

1240
01:05:50.166 --> 01:05:52.083
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

1241
01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:54.083
And it's been cold without him.

1242
01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:00.958
Attention! Attention. Attention. everyone!

1243
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.500
Oh God. Oh no.

1244
01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.125
Attention. everyone!

1245
01:06:05.708 --> 01:06:07.083
There's something I have to say.

1246
01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:08.833
Okay.

1247
01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:10.625
I'm losing my baby…

1248
01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:12.375
Come on. say it. Say it.

1249
01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.833
…to a siren's call.

1250
01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:17.541
-What?
-Oh. Jesus!

1251
01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.416
And in times like these.

1252
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.583
I turn to Bette Midler
for the right words.

1253
01:06:21.666 --> 01:06:22.541
Oh no!

1254
01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.958

Uh-uh. We cannot be stingy with our songs
of love and devotion. baby.

1271
01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:21.666
I know. but it's my turn to toast Jason.

[clears throat] Hello. everyone.

1276
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.250
I am Caleb King.

1277
01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:38.166
Jason's older brother.

1278
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.458
Now. I don't--
I don't know much about relationships.

1279
01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:47.041
I've never been married. but I know what
it's like to be committed wholeheartedly.

1280
01:07:47.875 --> 01:07:50.708
And that is what you two
are about to do tomorrow.

1281
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:52.416
Commitment is

1282
01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:55.625
an active breathing thing.

1283
01:07:56.375 --> 01:07:58.458
Too many people walk away easily…

1284
01:08:00.916 --> 01:08:02.125
give up easily.

1285
01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:07.250
But the strength and love that it takes
to choose commitment.

1286
01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.708
well. that…
that is something to look up to.

1287
01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:12.416
And I do.

1288
01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:19.250
So… [clears throat]

-Jason called off the wedding?
-What?

1303
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:07.916
No. The rehearsal dinner.

1304
01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:12.166
But… [sighs]

1305
01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:15.000
…I think he's having cold feet.

1306
01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:18.958
So I figured I'd keep watch.

1307
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:23.708
In case he tries anything stupid.

1308
01:09:25.458 --> 01:09:27.583
What do you mean by s-- stupid? [chuckles]

Okay. "Wind Beneath My Wings"
is actually a good choice.

1311
01:09:35.958 --> 01:09:40.083
but I would take Naomi for more
of a "I Will Always Love You."

1312
01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:41.833
Yeah. That kinda mother-in-law.

1313

-She has one of those headscarves. too.
-Yes. I bet.

1317
01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:57.250
I bet you're glad you don't have
to deal with her?

1318
01:09:58.083 --> 01:09:58.916
Maybe.

1319
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:03.250
Or… [sighs]
…maybe I would have grown to like her.

1320
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:04.791
You would have.

1321
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.875

01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:43.083
Well. see. they have a code of honor
that they live by.

1352
01:11:45.041 --> 01:11:47.708
-Well. okay. I wish life was that easy.
-Mm.

1353
01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:49.916
-Well…
-[both sigh]

1354
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.416
…it's not supposed to be.

1355
01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:56.166
I mean. look.
the most interesting samurais.

1356
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.583
the ones you root for.

1357
01:11:58.708 --> 01:11:59.916
are complicated heroes.

1358
01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:03.083
[yelling. clash of steel continues on TV]

1359
01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:08.708
[both chuckle]

1360
01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:16.791
-Hey!
-Hey.

1361
01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:19.083
-I thought you were in your sister's room.
-I was.

1362
01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:22.166
-Wait. Where are you going?
-I was just gettin' some air.

1363
01:12:24.166 --> 01:12:25.291
Okay. Um…

1364
01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.875
-Can I…
-Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1365
01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:32.500
Baby. I'm sorry I didn't believe you
when you said your parents were a lot.

1366
01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:37.000
And I'm so sorry
that I was so cranky at dinner.

1367
01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:39.333
Um…

1368
01:12:40.916 --> 01:12:42.875
I wanna marry you
more than anything in the world.

1369
01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:45.666
but I can't lie.

1370
01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:49.166
Baby. I'm nerv-- I'm nervous.

1371
01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.416
[softly] Hey. Hey.

1372
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.500
I'm nervous. too.

1373
01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:59.708
-Really?
-Yeah. so nervous.

1374
01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:06.958
Okay. I mean.
maybe we can just be nervous together.

1375
01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:11.958
Deal.

1376
01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:13.916
[chuckles]

1377
01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:16.458
Oh.

1378
01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.166

-You asleep?
-[groans]

1381
01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:38.416
-I was.

[groans]

1384
01:13:46.208 --> 01:13:47.333
Thank you for staying.

1385
01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:51.000
Of course.

1386
01:13:55.125 --> 01:13:58.000
-[inhales] We should get some sleep.
-All right. Yep.

1387
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.833
Um…

1388
01:14:00.916 --> 01:14:03.416
Um. I can take the couch.
You can have the bed.

1389
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.500
No. You…

1390
01:14:05.625 --> 01:14:07.500
take your bed. I'll take the couch.

1391
01:14:08.458 --> 01:14:09.833
[softly] Okay. Here.

1392
01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:19.875
[Caleb grunts]

1393
01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.125
Ooh. yeah.

-Kidding!
-[both laugh]

1403
01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.458
Oh. my goodness!

1404
01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:10.458
I can't believe
you weren't going to say anything. though.

1405
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:11.708
Speechless!

1406
01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:13.500
[both laughing]

1407
01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:16.458
-[Erica] Goodnight!
-Night.

[knocking at door]

1409
01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:33.041
-Mm.
-[knocking at door continues]

1410
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.833
Coming!

1411
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.916
Erica. I need to talk to you.

1412
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.708
Jason. um.
this isn't exactly the right time. I…

1413
01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:46.125
What are you doin' here?

1414
01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:50.208
Look… Jason…

1415
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:53.666
-[chuckles] I knew somethin' was goin' on.
-What? No. We were…

1416
01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:57.250
-We were just watching Netflix and fell--
-Oh. Netflix and chill.

1417
01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:59.166
Now I feel real good about the situation.

1418
01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:00.958
He doesn't even know
what that means. Jason.

1419
01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:03.875
I-- I know what it means.
I know what it means.

1420
01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:07.208
But it was-- it was just Netflix.
all right? There was no chill.

1421
01:16:07.875 --> 01:16:10.541
Jason. even if it was.
you're getting married today. remember?

1422
01:16:17.583 --> 01:16:18.416
[sighs]

1423
01:16:23.541 --> 01:16:27.125
Erica. goin' after him isn't gonna
help either one of you right now.

1424
01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:28.541
Erica?

1425
01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:29.541
Erica?

1426
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:31.583
[sighs]

1427
01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:34.875
Erica. you should be
with someone who is sure

1428
01:16:35.666 --> 01:16:37.500
that you're the only choice for him.

1429
01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:42.083
That man is not Jason.

1430
01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:50.666
Jason!

1431
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.083
[sighs]

1432
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:58.625
Hey! Okay. you stop this right now.

1433
01:16:58.708 --> 01:17:01.375
This craziness stops right now.

1434
01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:05.500
-We're not running through the sand.
-Oh. how… My brother? Really?

1435
01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.666
Nothing happened.

1436
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:10.250
But are you-- are you really jealous. or

1437
01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.708
are you having cold feet. Jason?

1438
01:17:13.375 --> 01:17:14.333
I don't know.

1439
01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:17.791
I screwed everything up with you.

1440
01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:20.541
What's gonna stop me
from screwin' everything up with her. too?

1441
01:17:22.291 --> 01:17:23.125
[sighs]

1442
01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:26.541
We screwed things up for each other.

1443
01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:30.041
Jason. the truth is.

1444
01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:33.708
if you hadn't called off the wedding.

1445
01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:35.458
I probably would have.

1446
01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:39.916
Then…

1447
01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:42.708
Then what is all of this?

1448
01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:45.875
[sighs]

1449
01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:46.791
Nostalgia.

1450
01:17:47.875 --> 01:17:50.458
Coincidence. Guilt. Uh. I don't know.

1451
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.291
[sighs] Maybe all of the above.

1452
01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:53.416
[breathing heavily]

1453
01:17:54.666 --> 01:17:56.000
But if this was right…

1454
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:01.250
and you were the love of my life.
then it would not be this hard.

1455
01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:08.500
[Jason exhales]

1456
01:18:11.416 --> 01:18:12.291
I love her.

1457
01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:17.083
I was on my over to tell you that.

1458
01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:19.791
Then I saw Caleb.
and I just lost it. I just--

1459
01:18:19.875 --> 01:18:22.208
Look at me. I'm gonna screw this up.
I'm gonna screw this up.

1460
01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:25.375
-I know I'm gonna screw this up--
-No. Look. No. Listen. No. you're not!

1461
01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:28.166
Beverly loves you.

1462
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:33.333
You love her.

1463
01:18:36.666 --> 01:18:38.500
[exhales] Hmm.

1464
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.166
I feel like you're walkin' me across
another bridge.

1465
01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:43.916
Well…

1466
01:18:45.791 --> 01:18:47.541
we got across the last one. right?

1467
01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:50.875
Yeah.

1468
01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:53.750
-We did.
-Mm-hmm.

1469
01:18:54.458 --> 01:18:56.333
Come on. Let's get you married.

1470
01:18:59.583 --> 01:19:00.875
Yes. big sis.

1471
01:19:00.958 --> 01:19:03.875
Ma chérie. C'est trop bien. [chuckles]

1472
01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:05.500
You look so beautiful!

1473
01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:07.666
You like the sun behind you?

1474
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:09.583
Comfortable with those shadows?

1475
01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:12.833
No. I love the shade.
These are just some candid shots. So…

1476
01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:16.000
The photographers gonna come any minute.
Don't… Any second…

1477
01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:19.791
Maybe if she stands with
her better side forward.

1478
01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:23.125
-[Janelle] Okay. careful now.
-[Beverly] Thank you. Ms. King.

1479
01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:24.083
Thank you.

1480
01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:27.208
-[Janelle] Wow. All right then.
-Is that Erica with Jason?

1481
01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:31.000
Why on earth would my son
invite his ex to his wedding?

1482
01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:32.541
His ex?

1483
01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:35.541
Thank God he had the good sense
to call that off.

1484
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:38.875
But this staying friends
with your ex. ugh…

1485
01:19:38.958 --> 01:19:39.791
When?

1486
01:19:41.416 --> 01:19:42.791
When did he break up with her?

1487
01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:46.125
-About a month before the wedding.
-Okay. "the wedding." Oh.

1488
01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:47.333
[Naomi] Mm-hmm.

1489
01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:50.625
-When were they engaged?
-Last year.

1490
01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:54.375
[Janelle] Little hussy messed
with the wrong family.

1491
01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:58.000
She's gonna curse the day she ever came
to the wedding.

1492
01:19:58.083 --> 01:19:59.875
You better call the ambulance.

1493
01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:03.125
-[shouting] Call the Mauritian police!
-[dramatic music playing]

1494
01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:09.333
[sighs]

1495
01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:11.583
Erica!

1496
01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:13.541
Janelle?

1497
01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:17.166
-You lying. scheming. two-faced--
-It's not what you think!

1498
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:19.208
[Janelle] I know where you live.

1499
01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:20.625
[Janelle yells]

1500
01:20:21.375 --> 01:20:22.250
Where is she?

1501
01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:35.333
Erica! Erica. I need your help.

1502
01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:38.500
Beverly's sister called all out of breath.
Beverly has canceled the wedding.

1503
01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.541
Oh no!

1504
01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:42.750
Yes. and she's run away.
Nobody can find her. It's terrible.

1505
01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:45.541
Not for us. They still have to pay
for the wedding. but I feel bad.

1506
01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:48.208
She was breathing out a lot of emotion.

1507
01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:50.666
If you can help.
I would be eternally grateful.

1508
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:53.083
Of course. Okay.
I'll-- I'll-- I'm on it. I'm on it.

1509
01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:56.458
The cabanas are the other way.
Have you forgotten your ground tutorial?

1510
01:20:56.541 --> 01:20:57.583
Oh. c'est impossible.

1511
01:20:57.666 --> 01:21:00.125
-[yelling]
-[dramatic percussive music playing]

1512
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.416
Yeah. you better run. Erica!

1513
01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.333
[panting]

1514
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:07.083
-[Janelle panting]
-[Erica grunts]

1515
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:09.166
[Erica grunts]

1516
01:21:10.625 --> 01:21:12.958
-Oh. this is not a good time.
-Drive!

1517
01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:16.500
[Beverly] Get out!

1518
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:18.666
See what I mean?

1519
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:22.666
You get out of this van right now!
I know that you and Jason were engaged.

1520
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.375
I know you've been lying to me
this whole time.

1521
01:21:25.458 --> 01:21:26.958
Make her get out of this van!

1522
01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:32.625
-Wait. Let me fix this.
-How could you possibly fix this?

1523
01:21:32.708 --> 01:21:35.625
-Look. you deserve the truth. You do.
-The truth.

1524
01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:39.000
But-- But let me-- let me share this truth
a little bit further down the road.

1525
01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:41.125
-What?
-Further down. Just keep driving.

1526
01:21:41.208 --> 01:21:42.291
[engine revving]

1527
01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:45.000
-[Beverly] Take me to the airport.
-There's been a misunderstanding.

1528
01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:48.666
A mis-- I saw the two of you
on the beach-- Know what? Never mind.

1529
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.958
I will give you $200
if you throw her out of this van.

1530
01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:53.458
-[Barrington chuckles]
-Okay? Five. if it is still moving.

1531
01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:55.875
Don't even think about it.

1532
01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:58.708
If you don't throw her out of this van
right now. I'mma start swingin'.

1533
01:21:58.791 --> 01:22:02.291
[Barrington] All right. All right.
Okay. this is not part of my job.

1534
01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:05.250
Barrington.
Wait. wait. What are you doing?

1535
01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:08.500
-[Barrington] I just… [clears throat]
-No. No. no. no. no.

1536
01:22:08.583 --> 01:22:10.083
Okay. I bruise easily.

1537
01:22:10.166 --> 01:22:12.166
-Okay.
-[Beverly] No. no. No. no. no. no. no.

1538
01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.333
-[Erica] Barrington!
-No! Don't leave me here with her.

1539
01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:17.083
-[Erica] Come back! She's crazy!
-You cannot leave me here!

1540
01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:18.791
-[Erica] Barrington!
-Barrington!

1541
01:22:18.875 --> 01:22:20.833
You and Jason ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

1542
01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:24.208
Beverly! Beverly. I swear.
nothing happened between us.

1543
01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:25.833
Why should I believe you?

1544
01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:27.958
You've been lying to me this whole time.

1545
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:29.125
Okay. look…

1546
01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:31.250
Okay. we have history.

1547
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.958
and we should have told you. but-- but--
but we were-- we were both afraid that…

1548
01:22:36.833 --> 01:22:37.958
Well. this would happen!

1549
01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:41.625
I feel like such an idiot.

1550
01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:44.791
No. no. Please. please. look. look. look.
Jason and I are the idiots.

1551
01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:48.083
-Maybe you do belong together. then.
-No. we don't.

1552
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.958
Because you're his perfect match.

1553
01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.083
-[sighs]
-You know that dream that you have?

1554
01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:56.416
The both of you have?

1555
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.208
The-- The porch swing.

1556
01:22:58.291 --> 01:22:59.208
The children.

1557
01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:01.458
I-- I got hives just listening.

1558
01:23:03.416 --> 01:23:05.875
Well. why were you sneaking
behind my back. then?

1559
01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:07.875
Because we were blindsided.

1560
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:14.416
Truly. wh-- what are the odds
of him showing up here to get married?

1561
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:18.541
Actually. they're pretty good considering

1562
01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:21.083
Amber's really good at manipulating
social media algorithms.

1563
01:23:21.166 --> 01:23:22.000
but-- but still.

1564
01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:24.708
I'm not some country
fried-green-tomato idiot. okay?

1565
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:25.916
No. of course. you're not.

1566
01:23:26.875 --> 01:23:28.000
Well. the truth is…

1567
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.208
Beverly. I never got closure.

1568
01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.583
[sighs] I was happy. and I was hustling.

1569
01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:39.375
and all of a sudden. Jason was gone.

1570
01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:42.583
And I was sad.

1571
01:23:43.333 --> 01:23:44.750
but I was gonna be okay.

1572
01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.875
I was gonna make my music.

1573
01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:52.958
Because the love of my life
since I was a little girl was music.

1574
01:23:54.208 --> 01:23:56.250
I still thought my dream was coming true.

1575
01:23:57.583 --> 01:23:58.416
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:02.750
But that dream
was never getting married to Jason.

1577
01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:05.250
and that should have been my dream.

1578
01:24:05.333 --> 01:24:06.541
It should have been it.

1579
01:24:08.041 --> 01:24:09.250
It was my dream.

1580
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.958
Then why are you giving up so easily?

1581
01:24:16.083 --> 01:24:20.875
Just the idea
that Jason wasn't sure about me.

1582
01:24:21.666 --> 01:24:23.125
even just for a moment.

1583
01:24:24.583 --> 01:24:25.541
it hurts.

1584
01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:32.083
I know. and I'm sorry.

1585
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:38.708
But Jason is so sure.

1586
01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:42.458
And if you don't believe me.
just-- just please. just go hear him out.

1587
01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:47.541
Give him a chance to prove
that he is still the man of your dreams.

1588
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.375
[sighs]

1589
01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:52.708
[laughs nervously]

1590
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.583
I-- I do believe you.

1591
01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:00.375
I do.

1592
01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:05.041
But come on. th-- this isn't how
I envisioned my wedding day.

1593
01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.625
Well. your wedding day isn't over.

1594
01:25:07.708 --> 01:25:08.541
[sighs]

1595
01:25:09.916 --> 01:25:13.583
Let's get you back there.
and you go marry the man that you love.

1596
01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:20.666
[sighs] You're coming with me.

1597
01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:24.375
No. No.

1598
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.041
Yeah.

1599
01:25:27.083 --> 01:25:28.583
because you need your closure.

1600
01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.500
And I need someone to sing at my wedding.

1601
01:25:36.916 --> 01:25:37.750
Okay.

1602
01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:40.750
I would be honored.

1603
01:25:42.833 --> 01:25:43.666
Come here.

1604
01:25:45.458 --> 01:25:46.666
[both grunting]

1605
01:25:47.291 --> 01:25:48.333
[both chuckle]

1606
01:25:48.416 --> 01:25:51.958
This hug is gonna have to wait.
I'm. uh. I'm gonna go get Barrington.

1607
01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:56.250
-Everything's gonna be okay. Hang on.
-[Janelle] Erica!

1608
01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:58.208
-We'll-- We'll get back to the resort--
-[grunts]

1609
01:25:58.291 --> 01:25:59.291
Janelle. no!

1610
01:25:59.791 --> 01:26:01.375
[inspirational music playing]

1611
01:26:07.458 --> 01:26:09.875
[Barrington] We are gathered here today
to witness the union

1612
01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:12.291
of Beverly Strattford and Jason King.

1613
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:15.750
The bride and groom have chosen
to recite their own vows.

1614
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.375
-Should be interesting.
-[chuckles]

1615
01:26:18.458 --> 01:26:20.291
-[Barrington] Jason.
-[sighs]

1616
01:26:22.458 --> 01:26:23.291
Beverly.

1617
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.541
when people say. "I love you."

1618
01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:32.250
I think they focus on the "love" part.
and they don't recognize the "you" part.

1619
01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:35.750
When I say "you."

1620
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.333
I mean every moment of you.

1621
01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:42.041
The you that hums when she stirs her tea.

1622
01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:47.250
The you that gets so excited
by public policy.

1623
01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:51.541
The you that makes me lunches every day
before I go to work.

1624
01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:55.208
The one-day-mother-of-my-children you.

1625
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:56.125
[chuckles]

1626
01:26:57.666 --> 01:26:58.833
And that smile.

1627
01:26:59.833 --> 01:27:04.833
that washed my heart with sun
the first day I met you.

1628
01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:09.291
I love and I appreciate that you.

1629
01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:15.500
And I am so thankful and so honored

1630
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.833
I get to love all of you.

1631
01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:25.333
from now until eternity.

1632
01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:29.541
Beverly. I love you.

1633
01:27:31.291 --> 01:27:32.291
[crying softly]

1634
01:27:33.166 --> 01:27:35.333
[Barrington softly] Wow. Ooh…

1635
01:27:36.541 --> 01:27:37.500
This is--

1636
01:27:39.583 --> 01:27:41.208
Um. it was beautiful.

1637
01:27:41.708 --> 01:27:43.625
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

1638
01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.958
Whoo. Beverly.

1639
01:27:51.083 --> 01:27:51.916
Um…

1640
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.291
I had a poem that I wrote for you.

1641
01:27:57.166 --> 01:27:59.416
Um. and it has imagery and…

1642
01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.583
Doesn't matter.

1643
01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:02.625
Baby.

1644
01:28:03.583 --> 01:28:04.416
[guests chuckle]

1645
01:28:09.541 --> 01:28:11.750
-I love you.
-I love you. too.

1646
01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:13.166
You are my dream.

1647
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.333
Sorry. [chuckles]

1648
01:28:18.916 --> 01:28:21.125
And now. if there's anyone here
who knows why

1649
01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:24.125
these two should not
be joined together in holy matrimony….

1650
01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.708
Don't you even. Jason is not your husband.

1651
01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:29.458
This man to the left
in the blue leisure suit.

1652
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:30.583
that's your husband.

1653
01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:34.250
It's lapis. [clears throat]

1654
01:28:35.041 --> 01:28:35.875
[chuckles]

1655
01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:42.875
-[softly] Mom.
-I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1656
01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:43.916
[giggles]

1657
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.958
You may kiss. again.

1662

-Wow! Oh my God.
-Yeah.

1664
01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:21.250
-Okay.
-[Christian] Classy for the ladies.

1665
01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:23.166
-Hey. I love you guys.
-Cheers.

1666

-Cheers!
-Love. prosperity…

1667

-All right. Cool. well…
-All that.

1668
01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:29.500
You ain't even-- Oh. my goodness. Okay.

1669
01:29:29.583 --> 01:29:30.833
You got it on my leg.

1670
01:29:30.916 --> 01:29:33.541
[Christian] I'm sorry.
I'm really excited. I'm really excited.

1671
01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:35.125
-[party chattering]
-[chuckles]

1672
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.916
You seem happy.

[chuckles]

1674
01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:41.875
You know. for a while there.
I doubted I'd ever be again.

1675
01:29:42.458 --> 01:29:44.416
but look at me. [chuckles]

1676
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.666
I am.

1677
01:29:50.791 --> 01:29:52.916
You know what? Hold that thought.

1678
01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:56.291
[chuckles]

1679
01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:03.500
Whoo. [clears throat]

1680
01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:05.000
Beverly.

1681
01:30:05.083 --> 01:30:06.083
Jason.

1682
01:30:09.458 --> 01:30:12.333
Now. I know you wanted
your wedding song to be "Diamonds."

1683
01:30:13.166 --> 01:30:15.250
and I know that's a beautiful song.

1684
01:30:15.333 --> 01:30:19.500
But to me. it doesn't capture the love
that you have for each other.

1685
01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:23.708
and it doesn't express the love
that I have for the both of you

1686
01:30:24.458 --> 01:30:26.500
as my friends. so here it goes.
