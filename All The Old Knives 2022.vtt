3
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:53.232
Your family is connected.
What are they saying?

4
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:56.026
I don't know anything.

5
00:28:57.445 --> 00:28:58.404
Tahar?

6
00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:02.408
Is there another cell operating right now?

7
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.661
Can we expect other hijackings?

8
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:08.372
What are their capabilities?

9
00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:11.750
I told you.
I don't know anything about it.

10
00:29:12.168 --> 00:29:13.878
Conversation at the mosque?

11
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.297
You want to hear that people
are taking sides?

12
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.923
Of course they are.

13
00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:26.891
A few of the young ones are
packing their bags. Headed for Syria.

14
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:30.311
So Al-Da'irat is talking to
people here in Vienna?

15
00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:31.479
I don't know.

16
00:29:31.562 --> 00:29:33.355
Can you give me names?

17
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.525
It's too dangerous.

18
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:41.030
His name is Ilyas Shishani.

19
00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:42.698
We think he might be here in Vienna.

20
00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.618
I don't know this man.

21
00:29:50.372 --> 00:29:52.374
I don't know this man.

22
00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:56.962
Is there anyone else I can talk to?

23
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:00.049
I'm sorry.

24
00:36:58.216 --> 00:36:59.885
Give me your phone.

25
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:00.802
Your phone.

26
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:03.972
Quick.

27
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.266
Please.

28
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.432
Brothers and sisters...

29
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:16.019
You are taking part in a great struggle
that comes from a place of love.

30
00:48:16.102 --> 00:48:17.520
Love of Allah.

31
00:48:17.604 --> 00:48:20.148
Love of our parents and children.

32
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.110
Grandfather. I know
you understand the situation.

33
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:36.078
Yes?

34
00:57:38.581 --> 00:57:40.249
Who's this?

35
01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.675
His name is Ilyas Shishani.

36
01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:52.635
We think he might be here in Vienna.

37
01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:57.306
I don't know this man.

38
01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:49.960
It's been a long time.

39
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:53.130
What are you doing here?

40
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:55.466
Come.

41
01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.768
Are you behind it?

42
01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:49.812
The hijacking?

43
01:25:57.528 --> 01:25:58.946
Tough men.
