(wings fluttering)

8
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.535
- I can't see anything. Dad.
(Craig laughs)

9
00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.203
- Well. yeah. that's
kind of the point

10
00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:38.621
of the blindfolded.
isn't it. birthday girl?

11
00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:39.914
(both chuckling)

12
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.583
- All right.
- Here. right up there.

13
00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.584
- [Grace] Oops.

14
00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.796
(gentle piano music)

15
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.299
- This is all mine?

16
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.217
- That's right. Little
Ladybug. Your very own garden.

17
00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.762
- And you can grow
whatever you want.

18
00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.348
(Craig chuckles)

19
00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.058
- This is the best
birthday ever.

20
00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.893
- Oh. how could I forget?

21
00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:03.897
You're gonna need this if you
plan on planting any seeds.

22
00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.774
- My very own trowel?

23
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.693
- Amanda. remember this
when you use that trowel.

24
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.237
the key to any garden's success

25
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.406
is the love that
you put into it.

26
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.367
- I have plenty of love to give.

27
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.702
- Yeah. you sure do.

28
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.080
- Dig. dig.
(all chuckling)

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.539

(oven bell dings)

35
00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:43.103
- Mom!

36
00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.521
(footsteps pattering)

37
00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.939
(Amanda sniffs)

38
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.276
Hmm. (sniffs) smells
like snickerdoodle?

39
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:51.778
- Cinnamon give it away?

40
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.613
We've sold out every week

41
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.657
since the new pastor let me
sell them after Sunday service.

42
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:58.118
- Good because every
cookie sale counts

43
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.078
when the flowers
aren't blooming.

44
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.955
(Grace sighs)

45
00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.957
So much for frost being over.

46
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.625
The bloom is so far
behind this year.

47
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.420
the only thing we'll be
harvesting for Easter is dirt.

48
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.797
- The harvest calendar
is just an estimate.

49
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.674
It's been off in the past.

50
00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:16.302
Can't control the weather. but
we can control other things.

51
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:19.806
I should hear back soon about
our business loan application.

52
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.891
- Can't we just refinance?

53
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.852
- Not with the
mortgage in arrears.

54
00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.563
Your dad would be proud

55
00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.690
of how hard we're
trying. I know that.

56
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.694
- We have enough to make it
through Easter. though. right?

57
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.656
- Let's see what the bank
says about our emergency loan.

58
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.828
- I don't know what we'd
do without the farm.

59
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.955
- Well. we won't give up.

60
00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.791
I can still hope for
an Easter miracle.

61
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.172
- Can I take a few of
these for the road?

62
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.423
- [Grace] Mm.

63
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:59.429
- Maybe the tips of the
cafe will be extra big

64
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.181
on this extra cold morning.

65
00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.808
(Grace chuckles)

66
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.726
Okay. I'm gonna go. I love you.

67
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:05.643
- I love you too.

68
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:09.981
* Whoa. oh

69
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.733
* Yeah. I've been
through it all *

70
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.027
- Okay. Right behind you.

71
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.153
Here's your coffee.
- Cool.

72
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.946
Awesome. Muffin.

73
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:22.035
I have a regular latte and
a double espresso mocha.

74
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.079
- Thank you. Have a good day.

75
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.873
Thanks. Your regular.

76
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.708
Hi.
- Hey.

77
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.542
- What can I get you?

78
00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.378
- Good morning.

79
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.507
I'll have a large lavender
latte with a dash of cinnamon.

80
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.468
some agave. and almond
milk. only if you have it.

81
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.553
- Yep. sure. Give
me two minutes.

82
00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.721
- Thank you.

83
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.057
Hmm.
- Effie. I'm pretty sure

84
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.725
I need another two sets of hands

85
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.061
to make it through
the morning rush.

86
00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.521
How do you do it?

87
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.898
- When in doubt. more caffeine.

88
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.191
- Ah.
- Cheers.

89
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.902
- Cheers.
(both slurping)

90
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.529
Wow.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.863
- Mm.

92
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.865
Thank you. again. for
letting me pick up

93
00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.826
some extra shifts at the cafe.

94
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.869
Things are pretty
tight at the farm.

95
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.913
at least until the
spring bloom comes in.

96
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.750
- Well. I know you'd do
anything to save the farm.

97
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.712
For example. used to
love our play dates.

98
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.005
You know. the ones
where you just basically

99
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.965
got me to help you weed?

100
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.509
(both laughing)

101
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.637
- My dad always said that
pulling weeds built character.

102
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.930
- Uh-huh.

103
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.140
(Amanda sighs)

104
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.599
- Almond milk. lavender latte.

105
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.809
two pumps of agave.
dash of cinnamon.

106
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.810
- Thanks. Amanda.

107
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:30.979
- Have we met before?

108
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.399
- No. you just have a nice.

109
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.985
beautiful. labeled name tag.

110
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.030
- Oh. (chuckles) I
forget that's there.

111
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.072
- Mm.

112
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.783
Mm.

113
00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.828
This might be the best
latte I've ever had.

114
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.040
Mm-mm. nope. That's all yours.

115
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.791
- Um. that's a $14 tip.

116
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.461
- And I'd give you a
15th dollar if I had it.

117
00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.879
You see. some
people drink coffee

118
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.715
to. you know. drink coffee.

119
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:02.218
I drink coffee because
it's an experience.

120
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.471
and yours. it has
just the right amount

121
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.723
of lavender and agave. (slurps)

122
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.434
Mm. not too sweet.
not too floral.

123
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.519
and just the right temperature
for a cold day like today.

124
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.981
All right?
- Well. um. well. thank you.

125
00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.816
- [Derrick] No. thank you.

126
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.318
- I've never heard anybody
talk about coffee like that.

127
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.612
- Well. that's
because we just met.

128
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.491
- Right.
- I appreciate your artistry.

129
00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:28.203
your effort. most
of all. that smile.

130
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.162
Have a good one.

131
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.121
- Have a good day.

132
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.167
- Um. okay. that was adorable.

133
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.294
- What? He appreciated
my artistry.

134
00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.505
- Uh. that was a $14 tip.

135
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.007
Think he was appreciating
more than just your artistry.

136
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.258
Just saying.

137
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.510
Hi. Gladys.

138
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.387
- Oh. hi. Gladys.

139
00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.222
- Amanda Raymond. You're
in the coffee business now.

140
00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:51.101
- Uh. just temporarily. until
the spring bloom comes in.

141
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:54.187
- Fingers crossed that spring
is hiding around the corner.

142
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.772
I'll just take a black.
- Oh. Yeah.

143
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.524
- You know. I really
do miss seeing

144
00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.359
those dedication
arrangements from your farm

145
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.486
in the church
lobby every Sunday.

146
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.197
- That was really more
of my dad's thing.

147
00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.949
- I know you two were close.

148
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.285
Just know how much those
arrangements lifted my spirits.

149
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.204
I sure hope we get
to see them again.

150
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.997
and we hope to
see you again too.

151
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.419
- Um. I'm sure you'll see
my mom in service on Sunday.

152
00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.881
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

153
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:22.924
- Bye.

154
00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.595
Everything good?

155
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.974
- Uh. yeah. just...

156
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.893
It's hard. sometimes. when
people talk about my dad.

157
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.395
Brings up a lot.

158
00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.897
- Everyone has nothing
but love for him.

159
00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.525
I do too.

160
00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:46.156
Except some of those gardening
puns were way too cheesy.

161
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.241
- Um. what was a good one? Oh.

162
00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.492
"You grow. girl."

163
00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.161
- Uh. "What incarnation?"

164
00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.078
(both laughing)

165
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.415
(bell jingles)

166
00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.292
- Oh. Here she comes again.

167
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.793
- Who?
- Someone who seems to lack

168
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.712
a little sunshine in her life.

169
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.547
Hi.

170
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.091
- I'll take the usual.

171
00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.926
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.970
(Effie clears throat)

173
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.097
- Muffin. Muffin.

174
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.683
Nice day we've been having.

175
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.103
Thank you.
- Here you go.

176
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.396
- Keep the change.

177
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.397
- Oh.

178
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.815
- Have a good day!

179
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.612
Not one for conversation
much. is she?

180
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.989
- Yeah. she's a
real tough cookie.

181
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.075
- Speaking of cookies-

182
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.785
- Oh?

183
00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.620
- I think we deserve a
little cookie celebration

184
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.914
after having survived
that morning rush.

185
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.749
- [Effie] Mm.

186
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.334
- My mom made a fresh batch of
snickerdoodles this morning.

187
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.627
- Oh my gosh. oh my
gosh. oh my gosh.

188
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.796
Mm.
(snickerdoodle crunching)

189
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.089
Mm!

190
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.049
No words. I have no words.

191
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.759
- Yum?
- Yes. that.

192
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.095
Mm! Wait.

193
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.682
Idea. How many of these
can your mom make?

194
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.351
'Cause we could sell
them in the cafe.

195
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.977
- I was hoping you
would say that.

196
00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.145
- You set me up?

197
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.022
- Mm. little bit.
- Oh.

198
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.441
And whatever profits we make
can go right back to the farm.

199
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.235
- Okay. you don't go that far.

200
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.737
- Uh-huh. Amanda. um. I just
died and went to cookie heaven.

201
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.323
so. yeah. we should do that.

202
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:11.116
(snickerdoodle crunches)

203
00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.576
(both laughing)

204
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.161
Hi. How can I help you?

205
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.914
(shovel thudding)

206
00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:18.915
(Amanda sighs)

207
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.000
- Come on.

208
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.044
(shovel thuds)
(Amanda sighs)

209
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.254
(shovel clatters)

210
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.090
(Amanda sighing)

211
00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.926
(gentle music)

212
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.723
How come they
haven't come out yet?

213
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.726
- [Craig] Because they
still need time. Ladybug.

214
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.770
- But what if something is
wrong? I'm getting worried.

215
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.232
- You know what I do
when I'm worrying?

216
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.151
I say a little prayer.

217
00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.652
- Why do you do that?

218
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.864
- Because it lets me
give my worries away

219
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.241
instead of letting
them weigh me down.

220
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.786
and I know God will
take them from me.

221
00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.372
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

222
00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:00.707
- I guess I'll try.

223
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.379
Hi. God. It's me.
Amanda Raymond.

224
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.256
I'm really nervous
about my garden.

225
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:12.052
Please help them grow to be
big. beautiful. and healthy.

226
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.762
Amen.

227
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.598
How was that?

228
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.433
- That was perfect.

229
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.559
(Craig chuckles)

230
00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.604
(gentle music)

231
00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.568
(Amanda sighs)

232
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.738
- I know that you'd probably
be praying right now.

233
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:37.952
Prayers can't melt ice.
they can't bring you back.

234
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.915
(tires screeching)

235
00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.124
(car crashes)

236
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.001
(door clacks)

237
00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.127
Hey. are you okay?

238
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.796
- Oh. I think so.

239
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.714
Yeah. no bumps. no bruises.
Oh. thank goodness.

240
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.383
- Do you live nearby?

241
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.469
- Closer to town. My husband
and I just moved here.

242
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:58.139
Yeah. I'm gonna call him and
he's gonna come and get me.

243
00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.808
- Okay. okay.

244
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.227
Um. I can also get your
car out with our tractor.

245
00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.730
But. um. should we go inside?
It's freezing out here.

246
00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.857
- Oh. you're a godsend.

247
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.485
- Amanda.
- Oh. Lori.

248
00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:11.903
- [Amanda] Yeah.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

249
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.238
Just watch your step there.
- Yeah.

250
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.489
I'm just a little shooken up.

251
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.366
- [Amanda] I'll
put the kettle on.

252
00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:19.452
- Nothing better than a hot
cup of cocoa on a frigid day.

253
00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:20.704
(Amanda chuckles)

254
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.330
- Cheers to that.

255
00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.251
- Oh. you have a lovely home.

256
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.627
You live here with your husband?

257
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.171
- No. I am single. (chuckles)

258
00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.631
It's my parents' house.

259
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:35.135
Well. um. actually.
it's my mom's house.

260
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.262
My dad died last year.

261
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.680
- Sorry to hear that.

262
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.184
I did see the sign on
your farm out front.

263
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.937
The Raymond Pick Your
Own Bouquet Flower Farm?

264
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.189
- Yeah. that's our
family business.

265
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.984
I know. it doesn't look
like much right now.

266
00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.820
but. hopefully. in a few weeks.

267
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.406
it'll be a cornucopia
of color out there.

268
00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.491
- Oh. yeah. the weather.

269
00:10:58.533 --> 00:10:59.826
It's either they're a gardener's

270
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:02.162
greatest ally or worst enemy.

271
00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:02.996
(both chuckling)

272
00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.581
Let me guess.

273
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.417
Pink peonies and maybe a
row of purple hyacinths

274
00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:10.837
to complement them. and. oh.
I can imagine a wide array

275
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.381
of tulips. perfect
Easter flower.

276
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:17.260
and. maybe a hybrid or two
when they cross-pollinate.

277
00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.680
- Okay. Lori. most people
don't know the difference

278
00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.641
between a daisy and a daffodil.

279
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.393
What's your secret?

280
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.687
- My whole life has been the
business of flowers. dear.

281
00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.397
- So you're a florist?

282
00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:30.982
- Was for 40 years.

283
00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.985
I'm officially retired
now. It's just a hobby.

284
00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.654
I don't even compete
in the annual

285
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.698
Easter Flower Arranging
Competition anymore.

286
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.117
- But you have.
Have you ever won?

287
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.870
- Oh. I haven't. but I
placed second last year.

288
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.580
My highest finish.

289
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.832
- So. um. I'm sitting
with floral royalty.

290
00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.876
is what you're saying.

291
00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.671
- Certainly not the queen. but
perhaps in her royal court.

292
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.673
(Amanda chuckles)

293
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.508
- Um. I can go get my tractor

294
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.926
and we can get you
back on the road?

295
00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.512
- Mm. Oh. I certainly
appreciate that.

296
00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.473
Thank you so much.

297
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.602
Amanda?
- Hmm?

298
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.480
- Is there anything that
I can do to repay you

299
00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:11.981
for your help with my car?

300
00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.900
- Um. well. can
you pull a miracle

301
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.860
and melt the ice out there?
(Lori chuckles)

302
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.362
- You really need a bloom. huh?

303
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.947
- You know the flower business.

304
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.907
We make most of our money
during certain seasons.

305
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.785
and with the Easter bloom
being so far behind-

306
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:26.621
- Well. sadly. my alter
ego isn't Mother Nature.

307
00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:32.127
but what about that Easter
Flower Arranging Competition?

308
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.797
I mean. the prize is $20.000.

309
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:39.759
- Wow. I mean. that
would be enough

310
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.928
to get us through the season.

311
00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:46.433
Except there's just
one tiny. huge problem.

312
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.310
I'm a farmer. not a florist.

313
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.854
I mean. that's why we
have our customers pick

314
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.063
their own bouquets.

315
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.732
- Well. that's where I come in.

316
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.316
I mean. I know six weeks
is not a lot of time.

317
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.611
but I can teach you
what you need to compete

318
00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.196
if you're willing to learn.

319
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.657
- The cost of flowers alone-

320
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.242
- No. no. no. I can handle it.

321
00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:07.328
And we can always practice
with silk flowers.

322
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.788
I mean. think about it.

323
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:14.044
we might even dethrone
Queen Constance Hughes.

324
00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.920
- Constance?

325
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.213
- Yeah. she's won
10 years in a row.

326
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.674
Oh. oh. Amanda.

327
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.762
Come on. (chuckles) just
take my number here.

328
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.890
(pen scratching)

329
00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:31.936
Here you go.
(paper rustles)

330
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:35.065
- This is a very generous offer.

331
00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.651
and I'm sure it'd
be fun to learn.

332
00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.571
but I couldn't compete.

333
00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:45.200
I'd be going against people
with years of experience.

334
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.661
Thank you. but I'll
just have to find some

335
00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.330
other way to keep us afloat.

336
00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.207
- Okay.

337
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.669
But call me if you
change your mind.

338
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.380
- I will. Come on.
let's go get your car.

339
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.547
- Yes. please.

340
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:04.010
(gentle piano music)

341
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.345
- No. I understand.

342
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.555
You're just doing your job.

343
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.391
Thank you.

344
00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.560
- Hey. Is everything okay?

345
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.229
- That was the bank. Amanda.

346
00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.733
Our last two years of
sales just aren't enough

347
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.403
to give them confidence
to approve the loan.

348
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.114
- But that was our Hail
Mary to get caught up.

349
00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.035
(somber music)

350
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.708
I have to do it.

351
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:35.917
- Do what?

352
00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.212
- The statewide Easter
Flower Arranging Competition.

353
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.840
The first prize is $20.000.

354
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.758
It's at least enough
to keep us afloat

355
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.093
until the bloom comes.

356
00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.928
- Flower arranging?

357
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.014
Is this a skill that
you've been hiding from me?

358
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:54.269
- Hiding from everyone.
including myself.

359
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.106
But I met a florist
yesterday and she's retired.

360
00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:01.401
but she's competed before.
and she said she'd teach me.

361
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.196
- Your dad would
love to hear that.

362
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.407
- I have to at least try.

363
00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:08.616
Maybe our last hope.

364
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.328
- Well. little bit of
hope is all we need.

365
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:19.210
- Amanda. I have to ask.

366
00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.714
what made you change your
mind about the competition?

367
00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:27.927
- Our business loan
application got denied.

368
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.473
so winning the
competition prize money.

369
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.476
it feels like maybe
the farm's last hope.

370
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.271
- Well. then let's
not waste any time.

371
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.565
Take a look at
your blank canvas.

372
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.651
(Amanda sighing)

373
00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.236
Oh. I know that look.

374
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.947
- The "I have no idea
where to begin" look?

375
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:48.907
(Lori laughs)

376
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.075
- Yeah. that one.

377
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.035
Let's just have fun to start

378
00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.329
and we'll see what
we're working with.

379
00:15:57.165 --> 00:16:02.504
- Uh. so peonies and
ranunculus. iris.

380
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.634
and. go to a classic.
got some roses.

381
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.052
- Yeah. you do
know all the names

382
00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.887
of the flowers
and how they grow.

383
00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.391
but I wanna see you
actually create something.

384
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.810
- I think that my
creative side is

385
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.311
still hibernating for winter.

386
00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.813
(Lori chuckles)

387
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:20.939
- It's a good thing
there's no pressure.

388
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.816
Come on. just have fun.

389
00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.318
- Okay. You asked for it.

390
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.319
(hands patting)

391
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.655
(gentle music)

392
00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:29.698
Do some...

393
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.370
And. um. mm-hmm.

394
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:39.499
Roses.

395
00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.464
(Amanda claps)

396
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:52.053
I call it "A Thorn
Amidst Roses."

397
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.888
- [Lori] Mm-hmm.

398
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.557
(Lori chuckles)
- It's rough. I know.

399
00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:59.602
but I am ready and willing
to do whatever it takes.

400
00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.354
- That's the spirit.

401
00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.148
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You got a lot to learn.

402
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.567
There are five principles
to floral design.

403
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.153
You master those. you
got a chance to win.

404
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:11.156
They are harmony. contrast.
purpose. balance. and...

405
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.118
Uh. I'm gonna keep
the last one a secret.

406
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.203
- A secret?

407
00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:20.123
Well. I mean. don't I need all
five to win the competition?

408
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.583
- A secret for now at least.

409
00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.877
I mean. it's something
that you can only learn

410
00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.879
after you've succeeded
at the first four.

411
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.423
But let's get on with it.

412
00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.217
Now. the first
principle is harmony.

413
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.387
- Harmony?
- Yeah.

414
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.639
We're going on a field
trip for this one.

415
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.017
Come on. let's take a walk.

416
00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.226
- Okay.

417
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.939
(gentle music)

418
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.691
- Your lesson awaits.

419
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.902
- [Amanda] Inside?

420
00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.445
- Oh. is everything okay?

421
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.618
- I. I haven't been back
inside since my dad's funeral.

422
00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.371
and that was over a year ago.

423
00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:02.749
- So it brings back a lot.

424
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:03.917
(door thuds)

425
00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:04.918
- A lot.
(alarm chirping)

426
00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:05.919
- [Derrick] Hey. Mom!

427
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.087
- Oh. Derrick.

428
00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.922
- Hey.
- Perfect timing.

429
00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.548
Meet Amanda Raymond.

430
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.884
She's the flower protege
I was telling you about.

431
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.514
- We've met. Uh.
Mr. Lavender Latte.

432
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:21.518
- Mm-hmm. It's good to see
you. minus the name tag.

433
00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.686
(Amanda chuckles)

434
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.522
I'm Derrick. the new pastor.

435
00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.273
It's a pleasure.

436
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.359
Well. I don't wanna get in
the way of flower training.

437
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:32.654
Uh. late for choir
practice myself. so...

438
00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.114
* La la la

439
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.782
- Oh.
(Derrick clears throat)

440
00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.409
- As you can hear. I need
all the help I can get.

441
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.411
- Well. we're on our
way there as well.

442
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.413
- All right. I'll
see you inside.

443
00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:46.334
- Um. only if. of
course. you're ready.

444
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.463
- Yeah.

445
00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:51.589
(door thuds)

446
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.549
(door clacks)

447
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.552
(choir vocalizing)

448
00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:02.267
(choir continues vocalizing)

449
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.228
- I just need a moment.

450
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.855
- Take your time.

451
00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:13.319
(choir vocalizing)

452
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.699
(gentle piano music)

453
00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.748
(gentle piano music continues)

454
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.207
- Thank you. Just thank you.

455
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.712
Pink was Sonya's
favorite color. Yeah.

456
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.967
(gentle piano music continues)

457
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.724
- Lori. I just can't.

458
00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.312
(gentle piano music continues)

459
00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:50.273
(door clacks)

460
00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.492
I know. I'm ruining the lesson-

461
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.869
- No. no. Don't feel
bad for one sec.

462
00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.663
You know. it's not one
of the five principles.

463
00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.749
but the key to any
successful arranger

464
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:08.750
is the ability to adapt.

465
00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:09.709
It's not...

466
00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.254
Not every arrangement's gonna
go exactly as you want it to.

467
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.006
(door thuds)

468
00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.591
- Amanda. everything okay?

469
00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:22.931
- Yeah. I'm just not ready
to go back in there. Pastor.

470
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.935
- Please. it's only Pastor
on Sundays. It's Derrick.

471
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.728
Don't be so hard on yourself.

472
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.731
If you're not ready.
it's on your time. Okay?

473
00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.400
And I'd be happy to
open the door for you

474
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.318
if and when that time comes.

475
00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.822
- I appreciate it.

476
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:42.158
Um. it's very chivalrous.

477
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.743
- Well. I was raised well.

478
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.036
(Lori chuckles)

479
00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:46.371
Well. I'll let
you two get to it.

480
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:47.747
Hope to see you again.

481
00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.626
(gentle guitar music)

482
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.504
(record clatters)

483
00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:56.297
- [Amanda] This
is like a antique.

484
00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:57.757
- It's very retro.

485
00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:02.220
Now. for your lesson. I want
you to pay special attention

486
00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.305
to each person's solo.

487
00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:08.059
* As I went down to the river

488
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.144
- Soprano.

489
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.854
* Studying about that

490
00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.147
- Alto.

491
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.648
* And who shall

492
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.691
- Tenor.

493
00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:15.984
* The starry crown

494
00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:19.070
- The bass. (chuckles)

495
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.238
- Right. okay. I'm following.

496
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.823
(Lori chuckles)

497
00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.450
- Here's the best part.

498
00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:27.120
* Let's go down. come on down

499
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.080
- The harmony.

500
00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.415
- Yes.

501
00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:32.667
So. I think we can agree

502
00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:41.426
that. individually. these
flowers are lovely. right?

503
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.427
- Right.
- Now. I want you

504
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.803
to close your eyes.

505
00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.473
Close your eyes.

506
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.017
And I want you to imagine
that the quartet is singing.

507
00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.271
* Let's go down. come on down

508
00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:56.983
* O sisters. let's go down

509
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.902
* Down in the river to pray

510
00:21:58.943 --> 00:21:59.986
- Voila.

511
00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:02.906
(Amanda chuckles)

512
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.240
- How did you...

513
00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:07.118
- Your first
lesson. Grasshopper.

514
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.038
- I'm more of a Ladybug person.

515
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.623
- Noted.

516
00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:15.960
See. the key is to look
for ways for the flowers

517
00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:17.504
to complement one another.

518
00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:23.051
Now. you give it a try. Ladybug.

519
00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:25.178
(both chuckling)

520
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.429
- Okay.

521
00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:31.184
- So as you can see. we've
substantially upped our offer.

522
00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:32.560
really taking into consideration

523
00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:35.188
the value and
acreage of the land.

524
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.856
- Tom.

525
00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:39.442
We've told you before. and
we will tell you again-

526
00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:41.528
- It's not for sale. Hi. Amanda.

527
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:43.154
Your father was a
good friend of mine.

528
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:44.739
and I'm trying to
help you and your mom

529
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:47.701
by providing
another alternative.

530
00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:51.871
- That a letter from
the mortgage company?

531
00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:55.083
- We're getting more
and more behind.

532
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.043
and without the business loan-

533
00:22:57.085 --> 00:22:58.837
- It's a notice for foreclosure.

534
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:01.339
- Again. I don't wanna
be in this position.

535
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:02.674
but I'd like to
give you the option

536
00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:04.968
to earn something
substantial and fair

537
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:09.472
based on what you've built.
as opposed to other options.

538
00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:10.557
(Grace sighs)

539
00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:12.350
- We still have time. Tom.

540
00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:15.353
And you're right. you
and Craig were close.

541
00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:16.730
so you'd know that he would-

542
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:19.566
- Decline my offer.
Respectfully.

543
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.069
I'm rooting for you.

544
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.989
Reach out to me before you
hear from the bank again.

545
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.909
You know where to find me.

546
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:35.665
(door clacks)

547
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.542
(door thuds)
- Foreclosure?

548
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.045
How did this happen?

549
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.589
- No reserves and bad weather.

550
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.091
and your dad was the
flower whisperer.

551
00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:48.178
- I should have moved back
here when Dad asked me to.

552
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.722
Maybe then I would know
more about the business and-

553
00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:54.768
- Listen to me. This
is not your fault.

554
00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:56.686
Have faith that things
will turn around.

555
00:23:56.728 --> 00:23:58.688
- Why would God do this to us.

556
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.690
after everything we
went through with Dad

557
00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:03.777
and frost and. now. foreclosure?

558
00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:06.029
- God doesn't work
like that. Amanda.

559
00:24:08.448 --> 00:24:11.493
I tell you what.
I'll get more hours

560
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.870
at the accounting firm.
and I'll keep baking.

561
00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:16.081
and that'll give
you time to practice

562
00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:17.957
so you can win that competition.

563
00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:20.794
How'd it go today?

564
00:24:22.295 --> 00:24:25.215
- Yeah. um. sorry. but

565
00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:29.636
I wouldn't count on
winning the competition.

566
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.181
(Grace sighs)

567
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:37.977
- God wants us to be joyful.

568
00:24:39.562 --> 00:24:41.940
but that doesn't mean we have
to be happy all the time.

569
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:47.487
There will be times in our
lives of struggle. of loss.

570
00:24:48.822 --> 00:24:50.782
But even when there are tears
rolling down your cheeks.

571
00:24:50.824 --> 00:24:52.992
there can still be
joy in your heart.

572
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:56.287
Ultimately. I want you
all to remember that

573
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:58.164
during the Easter season.

574
00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:01.668
Joy can be steadfast in sorrow

575
00:25:02.502 --> 00:25:04.879
and triumphant in tribulation.

576
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.965
Amen.

577
00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:08.508
- [Congregation] Amen.

578
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.010
- Amen.
- Amen.

579
00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:13.179
- Ah. James. pleasure.

580
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.557
Thanks. Jimmy. Good to see you.

581
00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:16.683
- Sweetheart.

582
00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:18.143
Oh. sweetheart. great.

583
00:25:18.184 --> 00:25:21.688
- Ah. thank you.
Papa. thank you.

584
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.190
- Wonderful sermon today. D.

585
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:26.776
Or should I say. Pastor D?

586
00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:28.653
- Samuel Stevens in the flesh.

587
00:25:28.695 --> 00:25:30.655
It's good to see you. my friend.

588
00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:32.365
Don't tell me you came all this
way just to hear me preach?

589
00:25:32.407 --> 00:25:34.826
- I know you're busy
now. but hear me out.

590
00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:36.453
I'm starting a new
venture that could be

591
00:25:36.494 --> 00:25:38.705
a really exciting
opportunity for you.

592
00:25:38.747 --> 00:25:41.041
A way to connect to
your two passions.

593
00:25:41.082 --> 00:25:43.585
- Okay. all right. well.
we should find time

594
00:25:43.626 --> 00:25:44.961
to chat. catch up.

595
00:25:45.003 --> 00:25:46.296
- We'll talk soon.
- Good to see you.

596
00:25:46.338 --> 00:25:47.589
- [Samuel] You too.

597
00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:50.050
- [Derrick] Hmm.

598
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.134
- Pastor.

599
00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:52.510
- Ah. (clears throat).

600
00:25:52.552 --> 00:25:53.636
- It's still Sunday.

601
00:25:53.678 --> 00:25:55.722
- Okay. you get a hall pass.

602
00:25:55.764 --> 00:25:58.391
- Uh. lavender latte?
Just the way you like it?

603
00:25:58.433 --> 00:26:00.643
- And what did I
do to deserve this?

604
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:03.480
- You know. token of
my. um. appreciation

605
00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:06.024
for your very generous
tip the other day.

606
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:07.984
But I don't wanna keep
you from the congregation.

607
00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:10.403
- Please. my congregation's
too busy gobbling up

608
00:26:10.445 --> 00:26:11.696
your mama's banana bread.

609
00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:14.532
- Mm.
- So. um. I've got an hour

610
00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:16.284
until my next service.

611
00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:17.744
Do you care for a walk?

612
00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:20.080
- Uh. sure.

613
00:26:27.587 --> 00:26:28.922
(dog barking)

614
00:26:28.963 --> 00:26:31.716
So how are you
liking town so far?

615
00:26:31.758 --> 00:26:35.053
- I love it. although.
for me. it's a bit cold.

616
00:26:35.095 --> 00:26:36.888
(both chuckling)

617
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.682
Yeah. my parents grew up in
Vermont. so they're used to it.

618
00:26:38.723 --> 00:26:41.518
but I was raised
mostly in the south.

619
00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:42.936
You know. come to think of it.

620
00:26:42.977 --> 00:26:46.064
people here are like
the weather there. warm.

621
00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.607
(Amanda chuckles)

622
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:49.359
- [Amanda] Your mom
said that are a bit

623
00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:50.819
of an outdoorsy type.

624
00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:55.073
- That's my mom. loves
talking about her son.

625
00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:56.533
(Amanda chuckles)

626
00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:58.243
But she's right. I do
love being outside.

627
00:26:58.993 --> 00:27:00.203
It's my happy place.

628
00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:04.708
- She also. uh.
mentioned four-wheeling?

629
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.459
- Did she?

630
00:27:06.501 --> 00:27:08.753
- And ax throwing.

631
00:27:09.754 --> 00:27:11.548
- Of course she did.
- Mountain biking.

632
00:27:11.589 --> 00:27:13.091
- What else?
- Uh. skydiving.

633
00:27:13.133 --> 00:27:14.426
- Well. that's
actually a lot of fun.

634
00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:16.886
(both laughing)

635
00:27:16.928 --> 00:27:20.223
- If I'd met you today.
I never would've guessed.

636
00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:24.686
- Is it the clean-shaven.
tailored suit jacket.

637
00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:26.146
polished dress shoes thing?

638
00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:28.857
It's not your typical
mudding outfit.

639
00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:31.818
- Can't say I've
met too many pastors

640
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.404
who like ax throwing
and skydiving.

641
00:27:34.446 --> 00:27:37.449
- Well. if you can't tell. it
means I'm doing a good job.

642
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.950
- What does that mean?

643
00:27:40.035 --> 00:27:43.872
- I'm new to this town.
so I don't want people.

644
00:27:43.913 --> 00:27:48.460
you know. knowing about
my extreme adventure
side. just yet.

645
00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:50.670
- You think that
they'd really care

646
00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:52.839
what you do for fun
when you're not working?

647
00:27:52.881 --> 00:27:54.507
- They have a lot
of trust in me.

648
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:56.509
And being a pastor is
a big responsibility.

649
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:58.470
I don't want people
thinking that I'm reckless

650
00:27:58.511 --> 00:28:00.889
and irresponsible
during my downtime.

651
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.640
I hope you can understand.

652
00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:06.436
Can we just keep
this between us?

653
00:28:06.478 --> 00:28:07.854
- Seriously?

654
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.939
- Seriously.

655
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:12.150
- Uh. sure.

656
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:16.905
Only if you tell me
more about skydiving.

657
00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:20.492
- [Derrick] I never
prayed so hard in my life.

658
00:28:20.533 --> 00:28:23.328
(gentle music)

659
00:28:26.998 --> 00:28:28.917
(soil rustling)

660
00:28:28.958 --> 00:28:31.211
- Amanda. It's six
in the morning.

661
00:28:31.252 --> 00:28:32.962
What are you doing?

662
00:28:33.004 --> 00:28:34.631
- I couldn't sleep and wanted
to start prepping things

663
00:28:34.673 --> 00:28:36.800
before heading
Lori's later today.

664
00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:38.718
- Well. let me help.

665
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:42.347
(bag rustling)

666
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:44.140
Saw you got to meet her son.

667
00:28:45.183 --> 00:28:48.353
- Mom. it's not like
that. He's the pastor.

668
00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:53.191
And. I don't know. we're
just in two different places.

669
00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:57.737
- You know. when I met your
father at the farmer's market.

670
00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:00.156
we were both searching
for the perfect bouquet

671
00:29:00.198 --> 00:29:02.701
and both found it
exactly the same time.

672
00:29:02.742 --> 00:29:06.287
And he insisted on
buying it. and I let him.

673
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:07.956
(Grace chuckles)

674
00:29:07.997 --> 00:29:10.291
Only to have him purchase
it and give it to me.

675
00:29:11.418 --> 00:29:12.919
But while your father was a man

676
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:15.797
who was incredibly
firm in his faith.

677
00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:18.842
he was also a man who was
always willing to meet me

678
00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:21.428
wherever I was in
my faith journey.

679
00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:25.515
- And I just met Derrick. I
don't know that much about him.

680
00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:28.852
- Well. and I'm sure he has
a lot to learn about you too.

681
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:31.021
Just do yourself a favor.

682
00:29:31.062 --> 00:29:32.856
don't let your own
fears get in the way.

683
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:36.109
(wings fluttering)

684
00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:39.863
(Grace gasps)

685
00:29:39.904 --> 00:29:42.407
You were always Dad's Ladybug.

686
00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:45.243
- The ladybugs are returning.

687
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:47.537
There's a slight bit of hope

688
00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:48.997
that the ground
will soften soon.

689
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:52.250
(wings fluttering)

690
00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:56.379
- Well. a slight bit
of hope is all we need.

691
00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:58.548
(Amanda chuckles)

692
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.258
Mm.

693
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.718
(birds chirping)

694
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.096
(patrons chattering)

695
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:09.809
- Amanda. Are all of these
table arrangements yours?

696
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.728
- Uh. yeah. I'm practicing

697
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.105
for a flower
arranging competition.

698
00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:16.274
- Why are you
using fake flowers?

699
00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:17.817
- Well. the frost.

700
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:20.236
and I don't have the
budget for fresh ones.

701
00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:22.364
so I've just been using
fake ones to practice.

702
00:30:22.405 --> 00:30:24.949
- Practicing with fake
flowers? That just won't do.

703
00:30:24.991 --> 00:30:26.951
Please. let me donate
to your flower fund.

704
00:30:26.993 --> 00:30:29.371
and I'll take all of
your mom's cookies too.

705
00:30:29.412 --> 00:30:31.414
- No. no. No. you can't.

706
00:30:31.456 --> 00:30:33.124
Um. that's too generous.

707
00:30:33.792 --> 00:30:35.418
- Of course I can.

708
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.213
Consider it an investment
in you and your talent.

709
00:30:38.254 --> 00:30:40.048
My reward comes in the
beautiful arrangements

710
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.927
I get to see from you.
here and at church.

711
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.389
- Thank you. Gladys.
(Gladys chuckles)

712
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.683
* Running into freedom

713
00:30:49.724 --> 00:30:53.436
* Dancing barefoot
like it's Eden *

714
00:30:53.478 --> 00:30:56.564
(bell jingles)

715
00:30:56.606 --> 00:30:57.774
(door thuds)
(Amanda chuckles)

716
00:30:57.816 --> 00:30:59.526
- Okay. as much as I would love

717
00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:01.111
to take a break and go shopping.

718
00:31:01.152 --> 00:31:03.613
shouldn't we be
focusing on flowers?

719
00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:05.782
- Oh. Ladybug. you
have much to learn.

720
00:31:05.824 --> 00:31:08.410
- Lori. Right on time.

721
00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:09.786
- [Lori] Tiff.

722
00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:11.246
- Amanda. so good to see you.

723
00:31:11.287 --> 00:31:13.164
I am so excited that
you came in today.

724
00:31:13.206 --> 00:31:14.791
Our spring line just came out.

725
00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:17.127
and let me tell
you. it is amazing.

726
00:31:17.168 --> 00:31:19.963
- Feels like you should be
focusing more on pushing scarves

727
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:21.798
and jackets with
the current weather.

728
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.467
- Well. you know what.
if you think spring.

729
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:26.011
then it will come.

730
00:31:26.052 --> 00:31:28.138
But what do you say we
try on some outfits?

731
00:31:28.179 --> 00:31:31.224
- Yes. Amanda. I want you
to pick out an outfit.

732
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:32.976
- Any outfit?

733
00:31:33.018 --> 00:31:34.477
- Whatever moves you.

734
00:31:35.687 --> 00:31:36.896
* Yeah. yeah

735
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:38.398
* You plant the seed of love

736
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.443
* You plant the seed
of love in my heart *

737
00:31:41.484 --> 00:31:46.906
* And it's bursting in
and out of my chest *

738
00:31:47.532 --> 00:31:48.408
(curtains rattling)

739
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.659
(Tiff gasps)

740
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:52.245
- [Tiff] Very cute. bright.

741
00:31:52.287 --> 00:31:53.121
- Oh. it's bright.

742
00:31:53.163 --> 00:31:54.372
Mm-mm!
- No. no. no.

743
00:31:54.414 --> 00:31:55.123
- What do you think?

744
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:58.168
- It's lovely. but...

745
00:31:58.209 --> 00:31:59.252
No. follow me.

746
00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:04.257
* Follow where the junk goes

747
00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:07.093
(Lori humming)

748
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:09.888
- There you go.

749
00:32:09.929 --> 00:32:11.014
(curtains rattling)
(Tiff gasps)

750
00:32:11.056 --> 00:32:12.515
- Ooh.
(camera snaps)

751
00:32:12.557 --> 00:32:14.309
- Yes.
(curtains rattling)

752
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:15.810
- It's really cute.
(Lori chuckles)

753
00:32:15.852 --> 00:32:18.563
Ooh. angelic. yes.
(camera snaps)

754
00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:20.732
(curtains rattling)
- Ooh.

755
00:32:20.774 --> 00:32:22.692
So I think...

756
00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:23.860
(Tiff laughs)

757
00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:25.737
Okay.
(curtains rattling)

758
00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:27.739
Oh.
- No. I'm not...

759
00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:29.366
(Amanda laughs)

760
00:32:29.407 --> 00:32:30.700
Try something else.
(curtains rattling)

761
00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:32.035
- [Lori] Oh my.

762
00:32:32.077 --> 00:32:34.496
- Oh my gosh.
looks very. very...

763
00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:36.498
(curtains rattling)
- Ooh.

764
00:32:37.499 --> 00:32:39.626
- [Lori] Please. twirl. twirl.

765
00:32:39.668 --> 00:32:40.794
(camera whirs)

766
00:32:40.835 --> 00:32:42.587
(curtains rattling)

767
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:44.923
- Oh.
- Oh. yeah. baby.

768
00:32:45.924 --> 00:32:52.347
(Amanda chuckles)
(curtains rattling)

769
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:56.017
So. what seems like a fun
fashion show is actually

770
00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:57.852
a valuable lesson
in floral design.

771
00:32:57.894 --> 00:32:59.938
You're gonna learn
that very soon.

772
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.150
(gentle piano music)

773
00:33:07.153 --> 00:33:08.154
Come on.

774
00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:16.663
- So is there a reason you're
avoiding the Constance?

775
00:33:19.249 --> 00:33:23.503
- Constance and I. well.
we used to be best friends.

776
00:33:23.545 --> 00:33:24.379
- Used to be?

777
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:25.922
- Yeah.

778
00:33:25.964 --> 00:33:29.050
We worked in the same
floral shop for years.

779
00:33:29.092 --> 00:33:31.886
Why. she had such
an eye for design.

780
00:33:31.928 --> 00:33:34.055
Yeah. there was
so much laughter.

781
00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:36.307
We worked so many
hours in that shop.

782
00:33:36.349 --> 00:33:39.769
creating arrangements
for every occasion.

783
00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:41.730
It's missing something.

784
00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:43.189
- Something bright.

785
00:33:43.857 --> 00:33:45.442
- And yellow.

786
00:33:46.943 --> 00:33:48.319
- [Both] A sunflower.

787
00:33:49.446 --> 00:33:51.656
- There was a signature
to all our designs.

788
00:33:51.698 --> 00:33:54.409
It was a single sunflower.

789
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:55.910
I like to think
that it represented

790
00:33:55.952 --> 00:33:58.121
the brightness of our friendship

791
00:33:58.163 --> 00:34:02.083
until. um. circumstances
changed that forever.

792
00:34:04.169 --> 00:34:07.130
You see. we had a plan.

793
00:34:08.214 --> 00:34:11.092
We were going to open
our own floral shop.

794
00:34:12.427 --> 00:34:17.140
And then I. then I met Don.
fell in love. got engaged.

795
00:34:18.558 --> 00:34:20.477
He relocated for work.

796
00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:22.687
And I had to make a choice.

797
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:29.194
follow my fiance or keep my
promise to my best friend.

798
00:34:32.197 --> 00:34:34.157
Broke Constance's heart.

799
00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.826
She stopped talking to
me. and I did the same.

800
00:34:36.868 --> 00:34:38.745
There was no coming
back from it.

801
00:34:39.662 --> 00:34:40.955
- Sorry to hear that.

802
00:34:40.997 --> 00:34:42.540
- You can imagine
how tense it is

803
00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:44.459
when we see each other every
year at the competition.

804
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:46.670
And. now. I mean.
thanks to my son.

805
00:34:46.711 --> 00:34:48.338
we're practically neighbors.

806
00:34:49.464 --> 00:34:51.466
- Why haven't you ever
tried to reconcile?

807
00:34:51.508 --> 00:34:54.511
- I think we're both just
too proud to forgive.

808
00:34:58.056 --> 00:35:01.393
(gentle piano music)

809
00:35:03.186 --> 00:35:05.939
So. take a look at
this first outfit.

810
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.233
You see how the black
skirt really makes

811
00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:10.610
the red top stand out even more?

812
00:35:10.652 --> 00:35:12.070
- Yeah. it pops.

813
00:35:12.112 --> 00:35:13.697
- Yeah. It doesn't
have to be just color.

814
00:35:13.738 --> 00:35:15.573
I mean. look at this one
with the free-flowing skirt

815
00:35:15.615 --> 00:35:17.158
and the fitted top.

816
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.869
- So shapes.
- Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.

817
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:23.748
And the stripes here
with the solid color?

818
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.125
- Patterns.
- Yeah. that's right.

819
00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:26.668
You're learning.

820
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.670
The second principle
is contrast.

821
00:35:28.712 --> 00:35:32.007
how contrasting colors.
pattern. shapes. textures.

822
00:35:32.048 --> 00:35:35.010
can all make things
stand out even more.

823
00:35:35.051 --> 00:35:38.179
Now. look. I made
this one earlier.

824
00:35:39.431 --> 00:35:41.683
It's not terribly
exciting. is it?

825
00:35:41.725 --> 00:35:42.976
- Could use a boost.

826
00:35:43.018 --> 00:35:45.520
- Yeah. I think so.

827
00:35:46.396 --> 00:35:47.230
Okay.

828
00:35:47.272 --> 00:35:49.858
(gentle piano music)

829
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:51.401
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

830
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:57.574
- So what you're saying is

831
00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.536
that contrasting things
can come together

832
00:36:01.578 --> 00:36:05.040
to create something
that is beautiful.

833
00:36:05.081 --> 00:36:06.291
- Exactly.

834
00:36:07.792 --> 00:36:09.586
- Kinda like you and Constance.

835
00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:16.176
- You. You caught
me in my own lesson.

836
00:36:17.552 --> 00:36:20.347
- Maybe you have
something to learn too.

837
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.436
- I think it's
too late for that.

838
00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:31.358
But you know what. I am
gonna go make us some lunch.

839
00:36:31.399 --> 00:36:33.693
you're gonna practice
contrasting arrangements.

840
00:36:33.735 --> 00:36:36.738
and then I'm gonna see what
you have when I get back.

841
00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:39.616
- Okay.

842
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.495
(gentle music)

843
00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:48.583
- Hey.

844
00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:50.418
- Oh. hi.

845
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.462
- Are you in the floral zone
or can I say a quick hello?

846
00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.090
- I think I would
have to be skilled

847
00:36:55.131 --> 00:36:58.259
to be in the zone.
so come on in.

848
00:37:00.053 --> 00:37:01.554
- So I have to ask.

849
00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:05.308
which one of these
flowers is your favorite?

850
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.687
(Derrick sniffs)
- Uh. a favorite flower.

851
00:37:08.728 --> 00:37:11.773
that's like picking
a favorite child.

852
00:37:11.815 --> 00:37:16.027
I mean. I guess I would
have to say the hydrangea.

853
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:17.987
- Oh.
- Or maybe on second thought.

854
00:37:18.029 --> 00:37:21.533
carnations or.
nope. maybe roses?

855
00:37:21.574 --> 00:37:24.369
I don't know. It's too.
too difficult to do.

856
00:37:24.411 --> 00:37:27.122
- I love seeing how
passionate you are about them.

857
00:37:27.163 --> 00:37:29.749
(gentle piano music)

858
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:33.420
Well. flower protege. I'll
leave you to your craft.

859
00:37:33.461 --> 00:37:37.841
But I do have one very
important question.

860
00:37:40.218 --> 00:37:43.680
(Derrick clears throat)

861
00:37:43.722 --> 00:37:45.849
Will you accept this rose?

862
00:37:48.518 --> 00:37:50.645
(Amanda laughs)

863
00:37:50.687 --> 00:37:56.192
- Um. well. after
careful consideration-

864
00:37:56.735 --> 00:37:57.402
- [Derrick] Mm-hmm?

865
00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.489
- I will gladly
accept this rose.

866
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:04.034
- You have my heart
pounding for a second there.

867
00:38:04.075 --> 00:38:07.037
(Amanda laughs)

868
00:38:07.078 --> 00:38:08.788
I have another question for you.

869
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:14.669
(gentle music)

870
00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.720
(gentle music continues)

871
00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:27.557
Hi.

872
00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:30.393
- Is this because
of you. Pastor?

873
00:38:30.435 --> 00:38:32.062
- Ask your daughter.

874
00:38:32.103 --> 00:38:34.898
(gentle music)

875
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.030
All right. everyone. right
this way. Don't be shy.

876
00:38:42.072 --> 00:38:44.657
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

877
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:57.629
(birds chirping)

878
00:38:57.671 --> 00:38:59.422
So what's up?

879
00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:01.758
- Well. like I said Sunday.
I'm starting a new venture.

880
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.510
It's a new mountain
retreats program.

881
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:06.137
We're doing week-long
spiritual retreats

882
00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:08.598
for young men up in
the Shenandoah Valley.

883
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.809
It's a great experience
for our retreatants

884
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.852
to be in nature and pray.

885
00:39:12.894 --> 00:39:14.020
- [Derrick] Hmm.

886
00:39:14.062 --> 00:39:15.605
- I've actively been looking

887
00:39:15.647 --> 00:39:18.233
for a spiritual
leader to guide them.

888
00:39:19.567 --> 00:39:22.779
But then it hit me. you're
the perfect guy for the job.

889
00:39:22.821 --> 00:39:24.489
God. the mountains.

890
00:39:24.531 --> 00:39:27.158
it has Derrick Matthews
written all over it.

891
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.535
(Derrick sighs)

892
00:39:28.576 --> 00:39:30.203
- I mean. Sammy.
you know I would do

893
00:39:30.245 --> 00:39:31.955
just about anything for you.

894
00:39:31.996 --> 00:39:35.291
I mean. I wouldn't be here
right now if it wasn't for you.

895
00:39:36.001 --> 00:39:37.377
It's just-

896
00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:39.295
- I know relocation
is inconvenient.

897
00:39:39.337 --> 00:39:41.089
given you just moved here.

898
00:39:41.131 --> 00:39:43.550
but this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

899
00:39:43.591 --> 00:39:45.760
Come on. don't you
miss the mountains?

900
00:39:45.802 --> 00:39:47.262
- More than anything.

901
00:39:48.138 --> 00:39:53.018
But. uh. I don't
rock climb anymore.

902
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.396
- That's not the only
thing this is about.

903
00:39:56.438 --> 00:39:58.398
Your story is powerful.

904
00:39:59.107 --> 00:40:01.651
The agony. the tears.

905
00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:03.528
I wanna be able
to use your story

906
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.530
to draw others closer to God.

907
00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:11.077
(Samuel sighs)

908
00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.746
Please really think on it.

909
00:40:12.787 --> 00:40:15.373
Our first retreat starts
shortly after Easter. so...

910
00:40:16.124 --> 00:40:18.460
- So you need an answer soon.

911
00:40:20.712 --> 00:40:23.548
(Derrick sighs)

912
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.384
(finger tapping)

913
00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:28.345
- A new concoction? Why not?

914
00:40:28.386 --> 00:40:31.723
I wanna see what your creative
side's been brewing up.

915
00:40:31.765 --> 00:40:34.100
Vanilla. Solid.

916
00:40:34.142 --> 00:40:36.269
Ooh. cardamom. um-

917
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:38.897
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. I know that you.

918
00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:41.816
Amanda. are still kind
of a coffee novice.

919
00:40:41.858 --> 00:40:44.277
but. um. I just...

920
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:46.654
Let me let you in on a
little industry secret.

921
00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.615
You never combine
vanilla with cardamom.

922
00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:51.826
They're totally different.
opposite. flavor profiles.

923
00:40:51.868 --> 00:40:53.787
They don't work together.

924
00:40:53.828 --> 00:40:55.288
Uh. yeah.
- Okay.

925
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.917
Don't think. just
experience it. (sniffs)

926
00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:02.003
- Yes. it's just that the
sweetness of the vanilla...

927
00:41:04.798 --> 00:41:06.132
(Effie chuckles)

928
00:41:06.174 --> 00:41:07.550
Contrasts perfectly
with the spice

929
00:41:07.592 --> 00:41:08.843
and complexity of the cardamom.

930
00:41:08.885 --> 00:41:10.387
You're a genius. What?

931
00:41:10.428 --> 00:41:12.639
- No. just a good student.

932
00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:14.849
- We have to put this on the
regular menu. like. right now.

933
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:16.184
What do you wanna call it?

934
00:41:16.226 --> 00:41:19.312
- Maybe. how about
Ladybug Latte?

935
00:41:19.354 --> 00:41:21.398
(bell jingles)

936
00:41:21.439 --> 00:41:24.401
- Ooh. two pumps. extra
handsome incoming.

937
00:41:24.442 --> 00:41:26.986
Ooh. Mr. Lavender Latte.

938
00:41:27.028 --> 00:41:28.863
- Mm-hmm.
(Effie clears throat)

939
00:41:28.905 --> 00:41:30.198
- Hello.
- Hi.

940
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.991
- Good morning. Amanda. Effie.

941
00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:33.827
- Hi.
- I'll do my usual.

942
00:41:33.868 --> 00:41:34.994
please and thank you.

943
00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:36.371
- Oh. you know what. actually.

944
00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:38.415
you should try
Amanda's new creation.

945
00:41:38.456 --> 00:41:41.209
the Ladybug Latte.
Mr. Lav. mm. Pastor.

946
00:41:41.251 --> 00:41:42.419
(Effie clears throat)

947
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.921
- Right. Sure. Ladybug Latte.

948
00:41:44.963 --> 00:41:46.423
That sounds very unique.

949
00:41:46.464 --> 00:41:47.841
(Amanda chuckles)

950
00:41:47.882 --> 00:41:49.801
It's Amanda's
creation. I'll try it.

951
00:41:49.843 --> 00:41:51.011
(Derrick slurps)

952
00:41:51.052 --> 00:41:54.973
Mm. Mm. that is. that is divine.

953
00:41:55.015 --> 00:41:56.391
Well. thank you. It's delicious.

954
00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:58.518
- Oh. um. Amanda.
great shift today.

955
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.021
Uh. you should go home.

956
00:42:01.062 --> 00:42:02.188
- Uh. but don't I-

957
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.773
- No. no. no. no.

958
00:42:03.815 --> 00:42:05.525
Actually. um. we're out
of your mom's cookies.

959
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:08.403
so I'm gonna need you to
make another batch of those.

960
00:42:09.154 --> 00:42:11.406
- Uh. yes!

961
00:42:11.448 --> 00:42:13.533
Ah. cookies. mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

962
00:42:13.575 --> 00:42:15.285
And it would be so much easier.

963
00:42:15.326 --> 00:42:18.580
um. if there were two pairs
of hands helping you do that.

964
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:20.790
I have to stay here.
though. so I just...

965
00:42:20.832 --> 00:42:24.044
I wonder if there's anyone
else who could help you.

966
00:42:24.085 --> 00:42:25.545
- [Amanda] Mm-hmm. hmm.

967
00:42:26.755 --> 00:42:29.549
- Oh. um. yeah. I
mean. the whole reason

968
00:42:29.591 --> 00:42:31.384
I came in today was
to get a little break

969
00:42:31.426 --> 00:42:33.386
from my Sunday preparations.

970
00:42:33.428 --> 00:42:35.388
I'd be happy to lend
a stirring hand.

971
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.890
Of course. if you don't mind.

972
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:37.932
- No. she doesn't.

973
00:42:39.017 --> 00:42:40.393
- I don't mind.

974
00:42:40.435 --> 00:42:42.020
(dial whirring and clicking)

975
00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:45.523
(stand mixer whirring)

976
00:42:45.565 --> 00:42:47.275
- Have you done this before?

977
00:42:47.317 --> 00:42:49.402
- What?
- Have you done this before?

978
00:42:49.444 --> 00:42:51.404
- Oh. um.
(dial whirring)

979
00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:54.074
- Have you done this before?

980
00:42:55.325 --> 00:42:57.077
- Is it that easy
to tell? (laughs)

981
00:42:57.118 --> 00:42:58.620
- Just a little.

982
00:42:58.661 --> 00:43:01.039
- My mom normally takes
charge in the kitchen.

983
00:43:01.081 --> 00:43:02.624
I just kinda follow her lead.

984
00:43:02.665 --> 00:43:03.917
- Yeah. I never
would've guessed that.

985
00:43:03.958 --> 00:43:06.920
(Amanda chuckles)

986
00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:10.715
- So. um. how did you get
into the business of God?

987
00:43:10.757 --> 00:43:12.300
- Ah. I see you changing
the subject now. huh?

988
00:43:12.342 --> 00:43:15.303
- Oh. just. you know.
redirecting away

989
00:43:15.345 --> 00:43:16.971
from this floury fiasco.

990
00:43:17.013 --> 00:43:18.264
(Derrick chuckles)

991
00:43:18.306 --> 00:43:20.100
I was just kinda curious.

992
00:43:20.141 --> 00:43:21.601
- You know. to tell you
the truth. I never thought

993
00:43:21.643 --> 00:43:23.478
I'd be a preacher or a pastor.

994
00:43:25.397 --> 00:43:28.024
I went to business
school. of all places.

995
00:43:28.066 --> 00:43:31.194
Quickly found out the
corporate world was not for me.

996
00:43:31.236 --> 00:43:32.987
so I decided to
follow my passion

997
00:43:33.029 --> 00:43:35.824
for the great outdoors
and teach rock climbing.

998
00:43:35.865 --> 00:43:39.494
I loved it. for
years. but. um...

999
00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:44.958
And one event. uh.
changed my life.

1000
00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:49.546
I fell. 60 feet.

1001
00:43:50.714 --> 00:43:53.591
Yeah. cracked my vertebrae
in multiple places.

1002
00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:55.343
had five surgeries.

1003
00:43:55.385 --> 00:43:57.262
Doctor said I'd
never walk again.

1004
00:43:58.513 --> 00:44:01.725
- Derrick. I'm so
sorry to hear that.

1005
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.518
- Yeah.

1006
00:44:04.936 --> 00:44:09.024
Yeah. that time in the
hospital. it was like my desert.

1007
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.569
I didn't have much to turn to.

1008
00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:15.447
But then I met Samuel Stevens.

1009
00:44:15.488 --> 00:44:18.116
He was my occupational
therapist.

1010
00:44:18.158 --> 00:44:20.577
He not only taught
me how to walk again.

1011
00:44:20.618 --> 00:44:22.537
but he taught me about God.

1012
00:44:23.038 --> 00:44:25.040
He saved my life.

1013
00:44:25.957 --> 00:44:27.792
I'd do just about
anything for him.

1014
00:44:27.834 --> 00:44:30.545
He gave me his
granddaddy's Bible.

1015
00:44:30.587 --> 00:44:33.631
I started reading it.
haven't put it down since.

1016
00:44:33.673 --> 00:44:36.718
That book. it gave me hope.

1017
00:44:37.552 --> 00:44:39.095
Hope turned into healing and.

1018
00:44:39.137 --> 00:44:42.140
before I knew it. I
was walking again.

1019
00:44:43.391 --> 00:44:47.145
- Wow. I mean. that's
an amazing story.

1020
00:44:48.146 --> 00:44:49.647
- Yeah.

1021
00:44:49.689 --> 00:44:54.361
- But do you ever wonder
how you would feel

1022
00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:55.904
if you were never healed?

1023
00:44:57.364 --> 00:44:58.698
- Of course I did.

1024
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:02.202
But I'm a firm
believer in faith.

1025
00:45:03.703 --> 00:45:07.916
You see. things
happen for a reason.

1026
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.294
even if you can't
see it in the moment.

1027
00:45:11.336 --> 00:45:12.712
- Faith.

1028
00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:16.633
Yeah. (chuckles)
that's a hard one.

1029
00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:17.842
- Yeah. it is.

1030
00:45:19.594 --> 00:45:22.097
Especially when things
aren't going your way.

1031
00:45:22.639 --> 00:45:23.932
- Kinda like now.

1032
00:45:24.933 --> 00:45:25.934
- Yeah.

1033
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:29.854
Care to share?

1034
00:45:29.896 --> 00:45:33.233
I mean. it's just me
and a big pile of dough.

1035
00:45:33.274 --> 00:45:36.194
(both chuckling)

1036
00:45:37.946 --> 00:45:41.741
- So I've been struggling
a lot with that

1037
00:45:41.783 --> 00:45:45.578
because. every year.
my dad would pray

1038
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.831
for a bountiful Easter harvest.

1039
00:45:47.872 --> 00:45:53.086
and. every year. it seemed
that his prayers were answered.

1040
00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:59.801
So why did he. of all
people. have a heart attack?

1041
00:46:01.803 --> 00:46:06.141
When he died. I came home
to help my mom on the farm.

1042
00:46:07.517 --> 00:46:11.688
And after his funeral. I
just. I stopped praying.

1043
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:15.650
stopped going to church.

1044
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:18.403
And then. this year.

1045
00:46:18.445 --> 00:46:23.158
of all years when we needed
our biggest Easter bloom yet.

1046
00:46:24.826 --> 00:46:29.080
we've had the worst
winter in decades.

1047
00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:32.000
So am I supposed to trust
that's just a coincidence

1048
00:46:32.709 --> 00:46:34.169
or is that a punishment?

1049
00:46:35.462 --> 00:46:36.838
- I don't think God's waiting
for us to get outta line

1050
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.715
just so He can reprimand us.

1051
00:46:38.757 --> 00:46:41.051
It's not a punishment.

1052
00:46:41.092 --> 00:46:45.055
Look. I like to
believe that God.

1053
00:46:45.096 --> 00:46:47.932
He loves us just as much
in good times as bad.

1054
00:46:49.684 --> 00:46:51.186
Maybe during hard times.

1055
00:46:51.227 --> 00:46:53.646
He just wanting us to get
a little closer to Him.

1056
00:46:53.688 --> 00:46:57.942
Comfort. support. love.

1057
00:46:59.152 --> 00:47:01.029
God loves us. always.

1058
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:05.950
- I mean. you're a pastor. so
you have to say that. right?

1059
00:47:06.826 --> 00:47:09.496
- Technically.
(both laughing)

1060
00:47:09.537 --> 00:47:13.041
I am. but I still make mistakes.

1061
00:47:14.584 --> 00:47:17.921
Also. supposed to
take care of people

1062
00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:22.300
and. uh. right now.
getting this flour.

1063
00:47:22.342 --> 00:47:23.343
- Ugh.

1064
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.223
- There.

1065
00:47:30.225 --> 00:47:33.228
(oven bell dings)

1066
00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:41.361
- So these are winners
from previous years.

1067
00:47:42.195 --> 00:47:44.948
and then there's mine.

1068
00:47:46.282 --> 00:47:49.452
- Well. there's still
time till Easter.

1069
00:47:50.704 --> 00:47:53.331
(cellphone ringing and buzzing)

1070
00:47:53.373 --> 00:47:54.708
- Oh. Good timing.

1071
00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:57.794
Lori.
- Good morning. Ladybug.

1072
00:47:57.836 --> 00:48:00.630
- Hey. please tell me that
you have another lesson ready

1073
00:48:00.672 --> 00:48:02.757
because I still don't
feel like I'm getting it.

1074
00:48:02.799 --> 00:48:04.843
- Patience makes perfect.

1075
00:48:04.884 --> 00:48:08.847
It's time for your third
principle: purpose.

1076
00:48:08.888 --> 00:48:10.932
Now. we've been working
on floral arrangements.

1077
00:48:10.974 --> 00:48:13.977
but it's important that
every design says something

1078
00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:16.855
on a more deeper.
personal level.

1079
00:48:16.896 --> 00:48:19.524
You have to find inspiration
outside the flowers

1080
00:48:19.566 --> 00:48:21.234
to put into the flowers.

1081
00:48:22.193 --> 00:48:23.445
- Okay. I'm following.

1082
00:48:23.486 --> 00:48:25.113
- So here's what
I want you to do.

1083
00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:27.574
The church is hosting
an Easter basket raffle

1084
00:48:27.615 --> 00:48:29.034
tomorrow evening at Parish Hall

1085
00:48:29.075 --> 00:48:30.994
to raise money for
the local food bank.

1086
00:48:31.036 --> 00:48:33.997
Church members and non-church
members are creating

1087
00:48:34.039 --> 00:48:36.541
and donating
individualized baskets.

1088
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:38.460
Now. the items in these baskets.

1089
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:41.880
they all mean something very
personal to their curators.

1090
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:45.884
- So you want me to
arrange an Easter basket.

1091
00:48:45.925 --> 00:48:47.719
but how is that
supposed to make me

1092
00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:49.429
a better floral arranger?

1093
00:48:52.223 --> 00:48:53.266
Lori?

1094
00:48:54.476 --> 00:48:55.894
- Sorry. dear. um.

1095
00:48:57.812 --> 00:49:00.273
not every lesson reveals
itself right away.

1096
00:49:02.442 --> 00:49:05.195
- Okay. I will do my best.

1097
00:49:05.236 --> 00:49:07.906
- You always do. I'll
see you tomorrow.

1098
00:49:15.372 --> 00:49:17.624
(Amanda sighs)

1099
00:49:17.665 --> 00:49:19.751
- Any ideas on where
I'd get some inspiration

1100
00:49:19.793 --> 00:49:21.419
for an Easter basket?

1101
00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:23.296
- I just might.

1102
00:49:25.632 --> 00:49:27.258
(page rustles)

1103
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.301
(Grace chuckles)

1104
00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:30.011
Oh. here's a good one.

1105
00:49:30.053 --> 00:49:31.346
- [Amanda] I used to love
it when Dad would push me

1106
00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:32.764
around in that wheelbarrow.

1107
00:49:32.806 --> 00:49:34.766
- And you always came
in needing a bath.

1108
00:49:34.808 --> 00:49:36.768
(both chuckling)

1109
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:37.894
(page rustles)

1110
00:49:37.936 --> 00:49:39.604
(Grace chuckles)

1111
00:49:39.646 --> 00:49:41.314
You remember that Christmas?

1112
00:49:41.356 --> 00:49:44.025
- That was probably the
best Christmas ever.

1113
00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:46.444
You know. I still use
those pruning sheers?

1114
00:49:46.486 --> 00:49:47.529
- Hmm!

1115
00:49:49.614 --> 00:49:50.865
Feeling inspired?

1116
00:49:51.783 --> 00:49:53.326
- I think I've got an idea.

1117
00:49:54.994 --> 00:49:56.621
(people chattering)

1118
00:49:56.663 --> 00:49:58.081
- Oh. thanks so much for coming.

1119
00:49:58.123 --> 00:50:00.417
Don't forget your
raffle tickets.

1120
00:50:00.458 --> 00:50:01.835
(Lori chuckles)

1121
00:50:01.876 --> 00:50:04.546
So what do you have?

1122
00:50:04.587 --> 00:50:06.798
- I did a My First
Garden basket.

1123
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.092
- Oh.
- I got something like this.

1124
00:50:09.134 --> 00:50:11.136
Christmases many.
many moons ago.

1125
00:50:11.177 --> 00:50:13.430
and it really meant a lot to me.

1126
00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:16.307
It gave me a sense of
independence and purpose.

1127
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:18.810
so. hopefully. it'll do
the same for someone else.

1128
00:50:18.852 --> 00:50:21.312
- You. Ladybug. have
aced the assignment.

1129
00:50:21.354 --> 00:50:23.857
When you have a special
connection to your arrangements.

1130
00:50:23.898 --> 00:50:26.234
it's gonna show in
the final product.

1131
00:50:30.697 --> 00:50:33.324
Um. Grace. can I have
your help. please?

1132
00:50:33.366 --> 00:50:34.325
- Sure.

1133
00:50:36.244 --> 00:50:39.039
(Amanda sighs)

1134
00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:43.126
- Where's the mulch?

1135
00:50:43.168 --> 00:50:44.586
- Ah. didn't go
with the aesthetic.

1136
00:50:44.627 --> 00:50:45.920
- Ah.

1137
00:50:45.962 --> 00:50:47.130
- Where's yours?

1138
00:50:47.172 --> 00:50:51.551
- Uh. it's a faith-based basket.

1139
00:50:51.593 --> 00:50:53.762
complete with mustard seeds.

1140
00:50:53.803 --> 00:50:54.846
- Very own brand.

1141
00:50:54.888 --> 00:50:56.556
- [Derrick] Mm-hmm.

1142
00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:58.475
- But why didn't you do
something that's. you know.

1143
00:50:58.516 --> 00:51:02.270
like a rock climbing basket
with some ropes. carabiners-

1144
00:51:02.312 --> 00:51:03.563
- I know. I know.

1145
00:51:03.605 --> 00:51:05.023
I can't control everything.

1146
00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:06.566
but one thing I can
control is how people

1147
00:51:06.608 --> 00:51:07.942
in the church see me.

1148
00:51:09.194 --> 00:51:11.154
- Maybe there's
something important

1149
00:51:11.196 --> 00:51:13.656
about sharing all
sides of yourself.

1150
00:51:15.075 --> 00:51:18.036
- It's a little more
complicated than that.

1151
00:51:20.246 --> 00:51:23.500
- But of course. I'm here
to meet you where you're at.

1152
00:51:24.709 --> 00:51:26.169
- I'm sorry. are you
coming for my job?

1153
00:51:26.211 --> 00:51:30.507
- Mm. I'll stick to
farming. for now.

1154
00:51:30.548 --> 00:51:34.719
- All right. Well. for now.
I should go MC the event.

1155
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:37.972
(Amanda chuckles)

1156
00:51:38.765 --> 00:51:41.393
(Amanda sighs)

1157
00:51:41.434 --> 00:51:44.270
(gentle music)

1158
00:51:46.272 --> 00:51:49.734
All right. and now for all the
green thumbs in the church.

1159
00:51:49.776 --> 00:51:55.198
we have a basket donated by
the wonderful Amanda Raymond.

1160
00:51:55.865 --> 00:51:57.242
A beautiful starter set

1161
00:51:57.283 --> 00:51:59.452
for the next great
gardener out there.

1162
00:51:59.494 --> 00:52:01.663
Would you look at
all those tickets?

1163
00:52:01.705 --> 00:52:03.206
All right.
- Please be my ticket.

1164
00:52:03.248 --> 00:52:04.624
Please be my ticket.
- See what we've got.

1165
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:09.963
And the lucky winner is 2842.

1166
00:52:10.255 --> 00:52:11.464
2842.

1167
00:52:11.506 --> 00:52:14.134
28-
- That's me.

1168
00:52:14.175 --> 00:52:17.762
- Well. there we go.
Constance Hughes.

1169
00:52:17.804 --> 00:52:19.180
Constance Hughes. everyone.

1170
00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:21.224
Thank you. Constance. You enjoy.

1171
00:52:21.266 --> 00:52:25.103
Okay. everyone. I think that
wraps up our event for today.

1172
00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:28.690
Thank you all for coming out.
(audience applauding)

1173
00:52:28.732 --> 00:52:31.484
(gentle music)

1174
00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:33.653
Hey.

1175
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.197
Look over there.

1176
00:52:37.323 --> 00:52:38.950
- [Constance] This is for you.

1177
00:52:38.992 --> 00:52:40.785
- Really?
- Yeah. I think it's...

1178
00:52:40.827 --> 00:52:42.037
Oh.

1179
00:52:42.996 --> 00:52:45.999
(gentle music)

1180
00:52:47.083 --> 00:52:48.335
You're welcome.

1181
00:52:49.044 --> 00:52:49.919
- Will you look a that?

1182
00:52:49.961 --> 00:52:51.171
- Uh-huh.

1183
00:52:52.297 --> 00:52:56.009
That right there? That's
the power of God's love.

1184
00:52:59.012 --> 00:53:00.972
- I do have to get
home and practice.

1185
00:53:01.014 --> 00:53:03.391
but. uh. I was wondering

1186
00:53:03.433 --> 00:53:06.186
if I could show you
something first?

1187
00:53:06.227 --> 00:53:08.688
- Yeah. Yeah. of course.

1188
00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:13.360
(gentle music)

1189
00:53:19.032 --> 00:53:21.618
- And voila.

1190
00:53:21.659 --> 00:53:23.244
- Wow.

1191
00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:25.538
(Amanda chuckles)
You've got good secrets.

1192
00:53:27.082 --> 00:53:28.458
(both sighing)

1193
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.418
Look at those stars.

1194
00:53:31.044 --> 00:53:32.379
God's freckles.

1195
00:53:33.171 --> 00:53:35.048
That's what my mom used to say.

1196
00:53:36.925 --> 00:53:38.551
- Can I ask you something?

1197
00:53:39.427 --> 00:53:41.304
- Sure. Anything.

1198
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:46.393
- I haven't been to church in
a year. and you're a pastor.

1199
00:53:49.062 --> 00:53:50.438
what do you see in me?

1200
00:53:51.773 --> 00:53:54.025
- So much. (chuckles)

1201
00:53:54.067 --> 00:53:55.568
I don't look at someone

1202
00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.405
and wonder how often
they're going to church

1203
00:53:58.446 --> 00:54:00.907
or if they're praying every day.

1204
00:54:00.949 --> 00:54:03.326
The size of someone's
faith. well.

1205
00:54:03.368 --> 00:54:05.412
that can change as life changes.

1206
00:54:05.453 --> 00:54:10.417
But the size of someone's
heart. that's what I see.

1207
00:54:11.584 --> 00:54:12.794
I see that in you.

1208
00:54:15.755 --> 00:54:21.136
The way you love your family.
your farm. those flowers.

1209
00:54:25.098 --> 00:54:27.350
- And I might be
losing all that soon.

1210
00:54:29.352 --> 00:54:32.105
- I know the stress of
all this must be a lot.

1211
00:54:33.023 --> 00:54:34.232
but have faith.

1212
00:54:36.693 --> 00:54:38.111
I see that in you too.

1213
00:54:38.903 --> 00:54:40.113
- You do?

1214
00:54:40.905 --> 00:54:42.115
- I do.

1215
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.285
I'm praying for you.

1216
00:54:46.244 --> 00:54:48.121
Be patient with yourself.

1217
00:54:48.955 --> 00:54:51.624
That's my sermon for tomorrow.

1218
00:54:52.334 --> 00:54:54.252
The fruit of patience.

1219
00:54:54.294 --> 00:54:55.879
- Now that's a tough one.

1220
00:54:56.838 --> 00:54:57.881
- Yeah?

1221
00:54:58.965 --> 00:55:02.260
It is. but it's worth it.

1222
00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.973
(gentle piano music)

1223
00:55:07.015 --> 00:55:12.479
Um. you probably have
some flowers that
need to be arranged.

1224
00:55:12.812 --> 00:55:14.064
- Yes.

1225
00:55:14.105 --> 00:55:15.065
- We should probably get going.

1226
00:55:15.106 --> 00:55:17.859
- Yeah.
- Uh. thank you

1227
00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:21.237
for bringing me here.

1228
00:55:21.279 --> 00:55:23.198
(Derrick chuckles)
- Yeah.

1229
00:55:23.239 --> 00:55:24.616
Okay.
- Yeah.

1230
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:27.911
Patience.

1231
00:55:35.126 --> 00:55:37.337
- [Lori] All right.
Everything's set.

1232
00:55:37.379 --> 00:55:38.672
Yep.

1233
00:55:38.713 --> 00:55:39.923
Ah. Amanda!

1234
00:55:39.964 --> 00:55:41.591
- Hi. Lori.
(Lori laughs)

1235
00:55:41.633 --> 00:55:44.177
I remember doing these
egg races back in the day.

1236
00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:47.138
- This is your fourth
principle: balance.

1237
00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.473
- Oh.
- Mm.

1238
00:55:49.683 --> 00:55:51.059
- All right. kids...

1239
00:55:51.101 --> 00:55:53.812
Oh. and Amanda. Welcome.

1240
00:55:55.105 --> 00:55:57.440
The first race is a
practice race. okay?

1241
00:55:57.482 --> 00:55:59.442
Time to perfect your strategy.

1242
00:55:59.484 --> 00:56:01.111
If you drop your egg. don't
worry. it's a hard-boiled egg.

1243
00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:03.029
Just pick it back
up and keep going.

1244
00:56:03.071 --> 00:56:04.698
All right. come to
the starting line.

1245
00:56:04.739 --> 00:56:07.325
On your marks.

1246
00:56:07.367 --> 00:56:08.493
Get set.

1247
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:10.620
Go!
(whistle shrills)

1248
00:56:10.662 --> 00:56:11.538
Go. go. go. go!

1249
00:56:12.372 --> 00:56:14.499
Careful. careful. You got it.

1250
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:15.792
Go. go. go.

1251
00:56:15.834 --> 00:56:16.668
(egg bouncing)
- Oh!

1252
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:18.253
- Oh. no!

1253
00:56:18.294 --> 00:56:19.713
That's it. That's it. Timmy!

1254
00:56:19.754 --> 00:56:21.131
Go. go. go! Yes!

1255
00:56:21.172 --> 00:56:23.299
Oh.
- Oh.

1256
00:56:23.341 --> 00:56:26.011
- Great effort.
Great practice round.

1257
00:56:26.052 --> 00:56:28.263
Okay. the real race
starts in a few minutes.

1258
00:56:28.304 --> 00:56:29.973
Do your stretches.
- How did I used to be

1259
00:56:30.015 --> 00:56:31.641
so good at this as a kid?

1260
00:56:31.683 --> 00:56:34.310
- Think of it like this.
look at your floral design.

1261
00:56:34.352 --> 00:56:37.147
and you have an imaginary axis
going right the middle of it

1262
00:56:37.188 --> 00:56:39.232
and you can distribute
flowers on both sides.

1263
00:56:39.274 --> 00:56:42.318
Well. think of it the
same way with the race.

1264
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.156
Center the egg on the
spoon on that same axis.

1265
00:56:46.197 --> 00:56:47.407
- Center on the axis

1266
00:56:47.449 --> 00:56:50.160
to create some balance.
- Yes.

1267
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:52.871
- So. feeling confident?

1268
00:56:52.912 --> 00:56:56.332
- Uh. about as confident as
I can be after one attempt.

1269
00:56:56.374 --> 00:56:58.668
- Well. good 'cause
I'm racing too.

1270
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:59.711
- Oh.

1271
00:57:01.421 --> 00:57:03.506
- Care to make a friendly wager?

1272
00:57:03.548 --> 00:57:04.799
- I'm listening.

1273
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:08.178
- Well. if you win.
I'll make you lunch.

1274
00:57:08.219 --> 00:57:11.723
If I win. you have to
listen to my Sunday sermon.

1275
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:16.353
- You know what.
fine. you're on.

1276
00:57:16.394 --> 00:57:18.938
- All right. Line up
on the starting line.

1277
00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:21.441
First one to the finish wins.

1278
00:57:21.483 --> 00:57:23.485
And get ready 'cause
this one's gonna be

1279
00:57:23.526 --> 00:57:25.278
a lot faster than the last one.

1280
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.529
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

1281
00:57:26.571 --> 00:57:28.615
(Amanda sighs)
On your mark.

1282
00:57:28.656 --> 00:57:30.617
Get set.

1283
00:57:30.658 --> 00:57:32.077
Go.

1284
00:57:32.118 --> 00:57:34.079
(crowd cheering)
Oh gosh. Don't drop it.

1285
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.538
Oh gosh.
- You cheat.

1286
00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.956
- I'm not a cheat.
- Okay. wait. wait.

1287
00:57:36.998 --> 00:57:38.833
- I'm a pastor. I'd never cheat.

1288
00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:39.751
Oh. no!
(egg thuds)

1289
00:57:39.793 --> 00:57:41.586
- [Amanda] Oh. no!

1290
00:57:41.628 --> 00:57:42.962
- No. no!

1291
00:57:43.004 --> 00:57:45.507
Oh. good job. guys.
You did great.

1292
00:57:46.216 --> 00:57:47.884
(Amanda laughs)

1293
00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:49.636
Good work! Wow!

1294
00:57:49.678 --> 00:57:50.762
You really got me.

1295
00:57:51.596 --> 00:57:53.098
(both laughing)

1296
00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:54.099
- I don't think I've
ever seen somebody look

1297
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.725
so happy to lose a bet.

1298
00:57:55.767 --> 00:57:58.895
- Well. losing means I
get to take you to lunch.

1299
00:57:58.937 --> 00:58:01.106
(Amanda chuckles)

1300
00:58:01.147 --> 00:58:04.067
- Well. Ladybug. those
are the four principles

1301
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:05.485
that I can teach you.

1302
00:58:05.527 --> 00:58:08.321
Harmony. contrast.
purpose. and balance.

1303
00:58:08.363 --> 00:58:09.864
- But there's still one left.

1304
00:58:09.906 --> 00:58:12.701
Master four and earn the fifth.

1305
00:58:12.742 --> 00:58:14.744
(hand patting)
- That one's in here. my dear.

1306
00:58:14.786 --> 00:58:16.246
You have to discover it.

1307
00:58:16.287 --> 00:58:18.415
And in the meantime. you
need to do the three Ps

1308
00:58:18.456 --> 00:58:20.834
of an expert floral arranger.

1309
00:58:20.875 --> 00:58:23.420
- The three Ps?
- Mm-hmm.

1310
00:58:23.461 --> 00:58:25.964
Practice. practice. practice.

1311
00:58:27.799 --> 00:58:29.217
(Amanda sighs)

1312
00:58:29.259 --> 00:58:31.636
(gentle music)

1313
00:58:31.678 --> 00:58:33.930
(door clacks)
- All right.

1314
00:58:33.972 --> 00:58:36.933
Almost there.
(door thuds)

1315
00:58:40.979 --> 00:58:42.689
(Amanda sighs)

1316
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:43.773
- It's incredible.

1317
00:58:44.649 --> 00:58:45.692
- Come on.

1318
00:58:45.734 --> 00:58:48.695
(Amanda chuckles)

1319
00:58:51.865 --> 00:58:55.910
So. this is what I
wanted to show you.

1320
00:58:57.537 --> 00:58:59.289
- [Amanda] They're snowdrops.

1321
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:00.498
- [Derrick] I had no idea
what they were called.

1322
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.501
I just thought they were pretty.

1323
00:59:04.252 --> 00:59:06.004
- They're perfect.

1324
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:11.301
Snowdrops can grow in adverse
conditions like frost.

1325
00:59:11.343 --> 00:59:13.136
but they also tend to be

1326
00:59:13.178 --> 00:59:15.805
the first flowers
to bloom in spring.

1327
00:59:15.847 --> 00:59:19.934
- Mm. They. uh. kinda
remind me of you.

1328
00:59:23.605 --> 00:59:24.939
- Thank you for taking me here.

1329
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:28.026
- Oh. we're not done yet. Nope.

1330
00:59:28.068 --> 00:59:30.737
We are just getting started.

1331
00:59:35.617 --> 00:59:38.620
- So. the other
day at the raffle.

1332
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:43.416
you were talking about
how it was complicated.

1333
00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:46.628
your image and how
the church saw you?

1334
00:59:47.379 --> 00:59:49.172
What did you mean by that?

1335
00:59:49.214 --> 00:59:53.885
- Yeah. um. when I told you
about my accident the other day.

1336
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:58.515
I wasn't able to tell
you the whole story.

1337
00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:04.104
You see. when I fell.
I lost my footing.

1338
01:00:05.438 --> 01:00:09.651
and one of my students.
he was tethered to me.

1339
01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.653
He fell even further than I did.

1340
01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:16.574
and. uh. he wasn't as lucky.

1341
01:00:18.493 --> 01:00:20.245
- He didn't make it?

1342
01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:22.872
- No. he did. Thank God he did.

1343
01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:29.921
Just. uh. he's in
a wheelchair now.

1344
01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:35.760
Not a day goes by that I don't
think about that poor kid.

1345
01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.430
I blame myself.

1346
01:00:40.306 --> 01:00:42.934
I can't even bring myself
to rock climb again.

1347
01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:45.937
- I'm sorry.

1348
01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:51.609
- You know. in many ways. I
feel like moving out here was

1349
01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:56.531
just my attempt to get away
from the memory of it all.

1350
01:00:57.782 --> 01:00:59.868
I feel like such a
hypocrite sometimes.

1351
01:00:59.909 --> 01:01:03.747
Now. I'm asking people to
find joy in their sorrow.

1352
01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:06.458
and here I am. I'm
running for my own.

1353
01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:12.297
- We all have
chapters of our lives

1354
01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:14.632
that we wish we could rewrite.

1355
01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:19.304
My dad would say.
"Without tests.

1356
01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:22.223
there could be no testimony."

1357
01:01:23.892 --> 01:01:29.230
Being open and vulnerable
shows your humanity.

1358
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.525
It gives people hope.

1359
01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:36.613
- I really like that.

1360
01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:39.574
Thank you.

1361
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.413
(gentle music)

1362
01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:48.166
(door clacks)

1363
01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:52.337
(door thuds)

1364
01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:55.173
(gentle music)

1365
01:02:01.304 --> 01:02:04.182
(flowers rustling)

1366
01:02:04.224 --> 01:02:05.809
- [Samuel] Have you decided?

1367
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.269
Your great word will reach
so many young people.

1368
01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:09.813
- I know.

1369
01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:13.316
I wanna help. and you
more than anyone know

1370
01:02:13.358 --> 01:02:14.651
about my adventurous side.

1371
01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:16.695
- [Samuel] What
better way. then?

1372
01:02:16.736 --> 01:02:18.947
- There's no way around
this relocation thing?

1373
01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:20.657
- Unfortunately
not. given the need

1374
01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.200
to be near the mountains.

1375
01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:24.994
But think of all the upside.

1376
01:02:25.036 --> 01:02:28.206
- It's just too good
of an opportunity to
pass up. isn't it?

1377
01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:35.005
(door clacks)

1378
01:02:35.046 --> 01:02:38.508
Well. it's a pleasure.
Samuel. as always.

1379
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.467
- It's good to see you.

1380
01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:40.385
- Take care. friend.

1381
01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:41.511
- You too.

1382
01:02:41.553 --> 01:02:44.597
(gentle music)

1383
01:02:49.686 --> 01:02:53.314
(gentle music continues)

1384
01:02:56.901 --> 01:02:58.194
(door clacks)

1385
01:02:58.236 --> 01:02:59.946
- Amanda?

1386
01:02:59.988 --> 01:03:02.157
(engine rumbling)

1387
01:03:02.198 --> 01:03:03.324
Amanda.

1388
01:03:03.366 --> 01:03:06.327
(engine rumbling)

1389
01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:16.046
- So...

1390
01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:21.718
(Amanda sighs)

1391
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.137
You got this. Just focus.

1392
01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:27.015
(cellphone chimes)

1393
01:03:27.057 --> 01:03:29.642
(Amanda sighs)

1394
01:03:29.684 --> 01:03:31.895
- [Lori] Good morning. Amanda.

1395
01:03:31.936 --> 01:03:33.355
I'm afraid I had a bit of a fall

1396
01:03:33.396 --> 01:03:34.773
carrying groceries this morning.

1397
01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:36.816
At the hospital now.
getting some X-rays.

1398
01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:40.362
Don't worry. I'll be
fine. Keep practicing.

1399
01:03:40.403 --> 01:03:41.738
I believe in you. Ladybug.

1400
01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.781
- Right.

1401
01:03:43.948 --> 01:03:46.951
Really? Is this part
of your master plan?

1402
01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:53.917
- Here's the good news.

1403
01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:58.254
you are the creator
of your own garden.

1404
01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.716
Yeah. there might be
a weed here or there.

1405
01:04:01.758 --> 01:04:03.593
those you just pull out.

1406
01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.721
They weren't supposed to be
there in the first place.

1407
01:04:08.014 --> 01:04:11.976
but with what's left. why
not water that with love?

1408
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:14.562
Let the light shine down on that

1409
01:04:14.604 --> 01:04:18.400
and it'll grow into a
life that is beautiful.

1410
01:04:18.441 --> 01:04:21.569
(birds chirping)

1411
01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:23.321
- You're right. Thanks. Dad.

1412
01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:24.906
I needed that.

1413
01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:25.990
- Yeah.

1414
01:04:30.745 --> 01:04:34.332
(machine beeping)

1415
01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:36.209
- Hi.
- Oh. Amanda.

1416
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:40.046
You and Derrick. you just
missed crossing paths. Oh my.

1417
01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:41.214
(Lori gasps)

1418
01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:43.299
You did these?

1419
01:04:43.341 --> 01:04:45.719
- Um. this morning.

1420
01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:48.805
- Well. Ladybug. I
think you are ready

1421
01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:50.890
to go win a competition.

1422
01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.227
- Well. there's still
one missing piece.

1423
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:57.022
but I think I know what
that final lesson is.

1424
01:04:58.023 --> 01:04:59.024
- You do?

1425
01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:01.776
- True beauty comes
from the heart.

1426
01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:06.281
so the key to a winning
arrangement has to be love.

1427
01:05:09.242 --> 01:05:10.243
(Lori clapping)

1428
01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:11.327
- Bravo.

1429
01:05:12.328 --> 01:05:14.914
The final principle of love.

1430
01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.625
a winning floral
arrangement is filled with

1431
01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:20.003
the love that you
put into making it.

1432
01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:23.048
(Lori sighs)

1433
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:26.801
Amanda. I very likely
won't be on my feet

1434
01:05:26.843 --> 01:05:29.512
in time for the competition.
but. I promise you.

1435
01:05:29.554 --> 01:05:31.723
I am gonna be there in spirit.

1436
01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:32.932
- Thank you.

1437
01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.185
That really means a lot.

1438
01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:41.733
- So. uh. what's going
on with you and Derrick?

1439
01:05:44.694 --> 01:05:48.198
You know. when someone
shows you who they are.

1440
01:05:49.199 --> 01:05:50.283
just believe them.

1441
01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:54.287
not just the bad traits.
but the good ones too.

1442
01:05:57.248 --> 01:05:58.208
Forgive him.

1443
01:06:03.588 --> 01:06:05.215
- It sounds like
we could all use

1444
01:06:05.256 --> 01:06:08.343
a little more
harmony in our lives.

1445
01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:11.805
- Yeah. you're so right.

1446
01:06:15.183 --> 01:06:16.393
Could you do me a favor?

1447
01:06:17.185 --> 01:06:18.228
- Sure.

1448
01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:22.399
(door knocking)

1449
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.401
(door clacks)

1450
01:06:24.442 --> 01:06:26.194
- Oh. Hello.

1451
01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:27.987
- I'm Amanda Raymond.

1452
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:29.864
We've never really
talked. but I work-

1453
01:06:29.906 --> 01:06:31.866
- Honey. I don't
mean to be rude.

1454
01:06:31.908 --> 01:06:34.077
but there's a very important
floral competition this weekend

1455
01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:36.538
that I need to focus on.
so now's not a good time.

1456
01:06:36.579 --> 01:06:38.039
- Yeah. I hear you.

1457
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:40.208
Um. I just need five
minutes of your time.

1458
01:06:42.627 --> 01:06:43.837
- Come in.

1459
01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:48.383
(door thuds)

1460
01:06:48.425 --> 01:06:49.968
This way. Please.

1461
01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:54.431
- [Amanda] Wow. that's gorgeous.

1462
01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:57.267
- Thank you.

1463
01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:01.604
- I'm here. actually. as
a delivery person today.

1464
01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:04.024
Lori Matthews wanted
me to give this to you.

1465
01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:10.530
(paper rustling)

1466
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:17.120
- Oh. Loretta. how
far apart we've grown.

1467
01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:19.122
- I don't actually
think the two of you are

1468
01:07:19.164 --> 01:07:21.833
as far apart as you each think.

1469
01:07:23.293 --> 01:07:26.087
Anyway. good luck at the
competition tomorrow.

1470
01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:28.465
I mean. not that
you're gonna need it.

1471
01:07:29.883 --> 01:07:31.426
- Thank you for stopping by.

1472
01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:34.596
- You're welcome.
(door clacks)

1473
01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:37.307
(door thuds)

1474
01:07:39.809 --> 01:07:43.146
Hey. God. It's me. Amanda.

1475
01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:51.988
I know we haven't talked
in a while. but I'm here.

1476
01:07:55.367 --> 01:07:56.910
We really need you.

1477
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:04.459
- Thank you.

1478
01:08:07.003 --> 01:08:09.964
- Ladybug Latte for
luck. (chuckles)

1479
01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:11.925
- You're the best.
(Effie chuckles)

1480
01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:13.343
(Amanda sighs)

1481
01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:17.514
So. win the competition.
save the farm.

1482
01:08:17.555 --> 01:08:18.682
No pressure. right?

1483
01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:20.308
- Well. if it doesn't work out.

1484
01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:23.561
maybe you can come on as
a partner at the cafe?

1485
01:08:25.021 --> 01:08:25.814
But who am I kidding?
You're gonna win this thing.

1486
01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:27.065
(Effie chuckles)

1487
01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:28.983
Okay. bye. (chuckles)

1488
01:08:29.025 --> 01:08:30.110
Hi.

1489
01:08:30.151 --> 01:08:32.278
- Welcome. talented florists.

1490
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.656
You will all have three
hours to create your designs

1491
01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:37.325
with a short break
at the halfway point.

1492
01:08:37.367 --> 01:08:39.661
As instructed in
the contest details.

1493
01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:41.121
you are all allowed to bring in

1494
01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:44.332
and incorporate one
item meaningful to you.

1495
01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:48.378
We look forward to seeing
your creations. and good luck.

1496
01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.464
(group applauding)

1497
01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:55.427
(timer dings)

1498
01:08:55.468 --> 01:08:58.054
* Been looking for
what's underneath *

1499
01:08:58.096 --> 01:09:01.224
* Holding on and keeping focus

1500
01:09:01.266 --> 01:09:04.978
* Oh. we're catching the
fireflies in the bottle *

1501
01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.605
* Don't wait until tomorrow

1502
01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:11.026
* We're living in the moment

1503
01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:15.030
* Not in control of
our final destination *

1504
01:09:15.071 --> 01:09:20.410
* We light up all
the places we go *

1505
01:09:21.119 --> 01:09:25.290
* We're catching fireflies

1506
01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:27.625
* Oh

1507
01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:30.295
* Oh

1508
01:09:30.337 --> 01:09:32.297
* Oh

1509
01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:35.842
(timer dings)

1510
01:09:35.884 --> 01:09:37.594
- Stop arranging.

1511
01:09:37.635 --> 01:09:40.764
We will have a five-minute
break before we continue.

1512
01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:42.057
- Ladybug.

1513
01:09:42.932 --> 01:09:43.767
(Lori laughs)
(Effie gasps)

1514
01:09:43.808 --> 01:09:44.601
- [Amanda] Lori.

1515
01:09:44.642 --> 01:09:46.227
You made it.

1516
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.897
- I got cleared just in
time. How are you doing?

1517
01:09:48.938 --> 01:09:50.398
- Not great.

1518
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.025
It's not coming together
like I want it to

1519
01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:53.860
and the clock is
ticking down and-

1520
01:09:53.902 --> 01:09:55.362
- It's okay.

1521
01:09:55.403 --> 01:09:58.239
Just close your
eyes. just breathe.

1522
01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.241
and I want you to think
about the five principles.

1523
01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:04.454
Harmony. contrast.
purpose. balance. love.

1524
01:10:04.496 --> 01:10:07.290
(gentle music)

1525
01:10:10.752 --> 01:10:14.214
- Okay. I'm gonna be okay.

1526
01:10:16.466 --> 01:10:19.969
- The halfway break is over.
The competition is back on.

1527
01:10:20.011 --> 01:10:23.098
- Okay. I. um. gotta
get back to work.

1528
01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:24.432
I will make you proud.

1529
01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:25.475
- You will.

1530
01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:29.896
* Oh

1531
01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:33.149
* There's hope for
a better tomorrow *

1532
01:10:33.191 --> 01:10:36.486
* There's hope for
joy over sorrow *

1533
01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:38.113
* 'Cause God's still good

1534
01:10:38.154 --> 01:10:43.243
* And He's still got
it all in control. oh *

1535
01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:46.287
* There's hope for a
world that can change *

1536
01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:49.624
* There's hope for
love over hate *

1537
01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:51.167
* 'Cause God's still good

1538
01:10:51.209 --> 01:10:54.587
* And He's still got
it all in control *

1539
01:10:54.629 --> 01:10:56.297
* Oh

1540
01:10:56.339 --> 01:11:00.927
- [Group] Five. four.
three. two. one.

1541
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:04.180
(group applauding)

1542
01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:09.185
* Oh. yeah

1543
01:11:09.227 --> 01:11:13.023
* Come on and keep on hoping
when the days get dark *

1544
01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:16.401
* Keep on singing. don't
you ever lose heart *

1545
01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:18.319
* Lift your eyes

1546
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:23.616
- And third place goes
to Lacey Williams.

1547
01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:27.078
(group applauding)

1548
01:11:28.329 --> 01:11:32.167
We are down to our
top two finalists.

1549
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:34.794
The judges would like
to recognize the work

1550
01:11:36.046 --> 01:11:41.217
of Constance Hughes
and Amanda Raymond.

1551
01:11:42.052 --> 01:11:43.553
(group cheering and applauding)

1552
01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:45.680
* Lift your eyes. you're
gonna be all right *

1553
01:11:45.722 --> 01:11:48.058
- The judges have collectively
decided that this has been

1554
01:11:48.099 --> 01:11:51.186
the closest margin
that we've ever seen.

1555
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.233
But the winner of this year's
Easter competition is...

1556
01:11:58.443 --> 01:12:01.321
* Keep on hoping

1557
01:12:06.993 --> 01:12:09.788
(gentle music)

1558
01:12:12.874 --> 01:12:18.171
- The winner is
Constance Hughes-

1559
01:12:19.005 --> 01:12:22.342
(group cheering and applauding)

1560
01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:26.096
Which makes newcomer. Amanda
Raymond. our runner-up.

1561
01:12:26.137 --> 01:12:27.514
(group cheering and applauding)

1562
01:12:27.555 --> 01:12:29.557
Congratulations to
all our participants.

1563
01:12:29.599 --> 01:12:31.351
and happy Easter weekend.

1564
01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:34.187
(gentle music)

1565
01:12:34.896 --> 01:12:35.980
(Lori chuckles)

1566
01:12:36.022 --> 01:12:37.232
- I tried.

1567
01:12:38.233 --> 01:12:39.651
Sorry.

1568
01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:41.069
- You're apologizing?

1569
01:12:42.195 --> 01:12:44.239
Can you imagine the look
on your father's face

1570
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.908
if he saw what you
accomplished today?

1571
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:48.535
He'd be over the moon.

1572
01:12:48.576 --> 01:12:50.203
- Now that's the truth.

1573
01:12:51.788 --> 01:12:54.582
Oh. he left. Big day tomorrow.

1574
01:12:57.419 --> 01:12:59.838
- Lori. I just wanted
to say thank you

1575
01:12:59.879 --> 01:13:03.216
for teaching me the
five principles.

1576
01:13:04.217 --> 01:13:06.094
I realized that
they're all things

1577
01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:07.887
that I've been missing
in my own life.

1578
01:13:07.929 --> 01:13:13.351
You've given me a renewed
sense of purpose on Easter.

1579
01:13:14.436 --> 01:13:16.354
- That's the most
important lesson of all.

1580
01:13:16.938 --> 01:13:19.774
(gentle music)

1581
01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:28.450
- Congratulations.
It's really beautiful.

1582
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:30.118
- Thank you.

1583
01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.163
- We're having an Easter
brunch at the farm tomorrow.

1584
01:13:33.204 --> 01:13:35.248
Um. wanted to invite you.

1585
01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:38.626
It's sort of a final sendoff.

1586
01:13:38.668 --> 01:13:40.503
- I'm not sure that I can.

1587
01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:42.839
but I really appreciate
the invitation.

1588
01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:46.134
- It would mean so much to
me if you could make it.

1589
01:13:46.176 --> 01:13:47.385
- We'll see.

1590
01:13:50.096 --> 01:13:51.848
Thank you for the sunflower.

1591
01:13:53.183 --> 01:13:54.392
- You're welcome.

1592
01:13:56.269 --> 01:13:57.771
- Happy Easter to both of you.

1593
01:13:57.812 --> 01:13:59.522
- Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter.

1594
01:14:00.982 --> 01:14:03.777
(gentle music)

1595
01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:12.619
(gentle music continues)

1596
01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.121
Warm weather on
an Easter Sunday.

1597
01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:16.706
Doesn't get much
better than that.

1598
01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:18.124
- It's just wonderful to see

1599
01:14:18.166 --> 01:14:20.085
the best version of
my daughter back.

1600
01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:22.545
Joyful and hopeful.

1601
01:14:22.587 --> 01:14:24.047
(Amanda chuckles)

1602
01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:25.965
- You're my mom. you
have to say that.

1603
01:14:26.007 --> 01:14:27.300
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1604
01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:30.679
(people chattering)

1605
01:14:33.598 --> 01:14:36.393
(gentle music)

1606
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:45.026
Dad did so many of
these for other people.

1607
01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:47.946
and we never did one for him.

1608
01:14:48.905 --> 01:14:51.199
Thank you for organizing this.

1609
01:14:51.866 --> 01:14:53.326
- Oh. it wasn't just me.

1610
01:14:54.244 --> 01:14:55.578
- It wasn't?

1611
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.663
- No.

1612
01:14:58.039 --> 01:15:00.333
Pastor Derrick called me
and asked if it was okay.

1613
01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:08.883
(gentle piano music)

1614
01:15:14.222 --> 01:15:16.933
(Grace sighs)

1615
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.479
I'm gonna go get our seats.

1616
01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.606
- Amanda.

1617
01:15:23.648 --> 01:15:24.607
- [Amanda] Pastor.

1618
01:15:29.779 --> 01:15:32.615
(Derrick sighs)

1619
01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:36.578
- On this Easter Sunday.

1620
01:15:37.328 --> 01:15:39.539
there is just one more fruit

1621
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:42.625
of the Holy Spirit left
to talk about. love.

1622
01:15:46.796 --> 01:15:50.216
'cause today is
about a resurrection.

1623
01:15:50.258 --> 01:15:54.596
And in that
resurrection. love wins.

1624
01:15:55.597 --> 01:16:00.143
You see. God loves all of us.

1625
01:16:00.185 --> 01:16:03.521
After all. we are
made in his image.

1626
01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:07.400
(gentle music)

1627
01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:12.781
And yet. I realized
I haven't been

1628
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.534
completely open
about my own journey.

1629
01:16:21.122 --> 01:16:23.708
God places people in
our lives for a reason.

1630
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:26.544
and someone very special
in my own life taught me

1631
01:16:26.586 --> 01:16:30.507
the importance of being
who God created me to be.

1632
01:16:33.677 --> 01:16:36.429
(Derrick sighs)

1633
01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:39.391
Before God's path led me here.

1634
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.938
I was involved in a terrible
rock climate accident.

1635
01:16:46.606 --> 01:16:49.567
It was a moment that irrevocably
changed several lives.

1636
01:16:49.609 --> 01:16:52.445
mine included. and
though I was lucky enough

1637
01:16:52.487 --> 01:16:54.823
to have forgiveness
from those around me.

1638
01:16:55.824 --> 01:16:59.536
I was unable to
find it in my heart

1639
01:17:01.246 --> 01:17:02.706
to forgive myself.

1640
01:17:04.749 --> 01:17:08.461
but. today. in the spirit
of the resurrection.

1641
01:17:11.047 --> 01:17:15.010
I forgive myself.

1642
01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:23.351
And I'm committed to embracing
who He created me to be.

1643
01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:27.480
including my love for rock
climbing. a gift from God.

1644
01:17:28.648 --> 01:17:31.151
You see. our relationship
with God is rooted

1645
01:17:31.192 --> 01:17:33.695
in love and forgiveness.

1646
01:17:34.779 --> 01:17:38.241
And just as God forgives
us. we. too. must learn

1647
01:17:38.283 --> 01:17:43.121
to forgive each
other and ourselves.

1648
01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:50.378
After all. forgiveness is the
purest expression of love.

1649
01:17:53.214 --> 01:17:55.717
So. on this Easter Sunday.

1650
01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:59.554
let us walk this path
of love together!

1651
01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:02.640
Amen!
(congregation applauding)

1652
01:18:02.682 --> 01:18:06.353
- Amen.

1653
01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:09.689
- Thank you.

1654
01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:10.774
Amen!

1655
01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:22.202
* Ooh

1656
01:18:22.243 --> 01:18:23.703
* Ooh

1657
01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:25.288
(door knocking)

1658
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:28.041
- I'll get it.
- Making up for a late bloom.

1659
01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.251
Chicken looks delicious.

1660
01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:31.836
(door clacks)

1661
01:18:31.878 --> 01:18:32.879
- Hi.
- Hey.

1662
01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.214
(Amanda chuckles)

1663
01:18:34.255 --> 01:18:35.548
Happy Easter.

1664
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:37.717
- Happy Easter.
(Derrick chuckles)

1665
01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:40.387
- Listen. I just
want to let you know

1666
01:18:40.428 --> 01:18:41.930
how much it meant to me.

1667
01:18:41.971 --> 01:18:44.349
You know. seeing your face
at church this morning.

1668
01:18:44.391 --> 01:18:45.934
it really warmed my heart.

1669
01:18:47.435 --> 01:18:50.939
And. uh. congratulations.
by the way. on yesterday.

1670
01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.732
- Thank you.

1671
01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:57.570
I. um. couldn't save the
farm. but. um. I did my best.

1672
01:18:58.363 --> 01:19:00.657
- I'm proud of you.

1673
01:19:00.699 --> 01:19:03.618
- And I'm proud
of you for showing

1674
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.995
the church your authentic self.

1675
01:19:06.037 --> 01:19:07.080
Took a lot.

1676
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.084
I'm gonna miss you.

1677
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.420
- Miss me?

1678
01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:15.964
- Yeah. Aren't you
taking the job?

1679
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.841
- Turned it down.

1680
01:19:19.634 --> 01:19:20.802
- Why?

1681
01:19:20.844 --> 01:19:22.929
- Because there's
something here.

1682
01:19:24.014 --> 01:19:26.933
something special. with you.

1683
01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:31.813
with us. and I feel
like it's just begun.

1684
01:19:32.856 --> 01:19:36.192
and I can't wait to
see where it goes.

1685
01:19:36.234 --> 01:19:39.070
Or grows or blooms or...

1686
01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:40.613
Okay. I'll stop.

1687
01:19:40.655 --> 01:19:45.660
That is. of course.
if you're open to it.

1688
01:19:47.245 --> 01:19:48.705
- Constance.

1689
01:19:48.747 --> 01:19:50.331
- Constance. (clears throat)

1690
01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:51.958
- You made it.
- I did.

1691
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.753
- Come inside. I
can give you a tour.

1692
01:19:56.087 --> 01:19:58.506
(Derrick clears throat)

1693
01:19:58.548 --> 01:20:00.175
Come in.
- Thank you.

1694
01:20:03.803 --> 01:20:06.264
(door thuds)

1695
01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:12.103
- I have to do it.
- Yes.

1696
01:20:12.145 --> 01:20:13.688
- Thank you. Loretta.

1697
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:16.649
And I just have to
say. I am so sorry.

1698
01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:18.735
Please forgive me.

1699
01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:22.238
- We both played an
equal part. Constance.

1700
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.742
so I ask of you the same thing.

1701
01:20:27.535 --> 01:20:30.789
(group chattering)

1702
01:20:31.998 --> 01:20:33.708
(glass clinking)

1703
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.251
(Constance clears throat)

1704
01:20:35.293 --> 01:20:37.170
- I have an announcement.

1705
01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:38.672
(Constance clears throat)

1706
01:20:38.713 --> 01:20:39.673
(Constance sighs)

1707
01:20:39.714 --> 01:20:41.675
(Constance chuckles)

1708
01:20:41.716 --> 01:20:45.553
This is such a beautiful farm
run by a beautiful family.

1709
01:20:45.595 --> 01:20:50.225
And. Amanda. you are the
most talented young farmer.

1710
01:20:50.266 --> 01:20:54.062
well. now. farmer and
florist. that I've ever seen.

1711
01:20:55.647 --> 01:20:58.817
And I might have won first
place in the eyes of the judges.

1712
01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:01.903
but you won first
place in my eyes.

1713
01:21:05.156 --> 01:21:06.950
And I would love nothing more

1714
01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:10.203
than to pass the
prize money to you.

1715
01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:15.125
(group applauding)
- Woo.

1716
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:16.584
- Oh my gosh.

1717
01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:19.170
- I don't know what to say.

1718
01:21:19.212 --> 01:21:21.631
- You don't have to say
anything. You deserved it.

1719
01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.216
(Constance chuckles)

1720
01:21:23.258 --> 01:21:25.844
I just ask that you name
the sunflower section

1721
01:21:25.885 --> 01:21:28.888
on the farm after me and Lori.

1722
01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:32.058
(group laughing)

1723
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.977
- It would be an honor.

1724
01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:35.228
(Lori chuckles)

1725
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:36.229
Thank you.
- Oh. you're welcome.

1726
01:21:37.188 --> 01:21:39.232
- Thank you so. so much.

1727
01:21:39.274 --> 01:21:40.233
- [Constance] Oh.

1728
01:21:43.278 --> 01:21:44.738
- What incredible timing.

1729
01:21:44.779 --> 01:21:48.575
- So this $20.000.
it would be enough

1730
01:21:48.616 --> 01:21:50.785
to tide us over until
the bloom comes in.

1731
01:21:50.827 --> 01:21:54.831
and I was thinking
that in order for us

1732
01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:57.000
not to be in this
position again.

1733
01:21:58.168 --> 01:22:01.129
how would you feel about
the Raymond Family Farm

1734
01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:05.383
transitioning into a
one-stop wedding venue?

1735
01:22:07.469 --> 01:22:09.012
- I love that idea. Amanda.

1736
01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:12.223
I have always wanted
to bake wedding cakes.

1737
01:22:12.265 --> 01:22:13.933
(group laughing)

1738
01:22:13.975 --> 01:22:16.019
- Weddings are beautiful.
- I volunteer to officiate.

1739
01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:18.605
- Oh. and I can help
with the arrangements.

1740
01:22:18.646 --> 01:22:20.899
as long as my assistant
here is available.

1741
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.817
- Oh. assistant.
(group laughing)

1742
01:22:22.859 --> 01:22:25.028
Oh. you haven't changed one bit.

1743
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.447
(group chuckling)

1744
01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:29.824
- Oh.
(group applauding)

1745
01:22:29.866 --> 01:22:31.242
- Okay!

1746
01:22:31.284 --> 01:22:32.786
Okay!

1747
01:22:32.827 --> 01:22:34.579
- [Derrick] All right.

1748
01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:36.289
- Well. dig in. everyone.
- All right.

1749
01:22:36.331 --> 01:22:37.957
(group chattering)

1750
01:22:37.999 --> 01:22:40.919
(birds chirping)

1751
01:22:43.338 --> 01:22:45.173
- Happy Easter. Dad.

1752
01:22:47.676 --> 01:22:50.679
(gentle music)

1753
01:22:53.848 --> 01:22:57.018
- Are the flowers part of
the whole wedding setup?

1754
01:22:58.269 --> 01:23:01.773
- It's funny you ask
because I was thinking

1755
01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:06.027
that couples could
stand right about here

1756
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:12.075
for their. um. first
kiss as newlyweds.

1757
01:23:12.492 --> 01:23:13.618
- Really?

1758
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:15.578
Right here? You sure?

1759
01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.082
'Cause there's a lot of really
beautiful parts of the earth.

1760
01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:22.711
(gentle music)

1761
01:23:25.296 --> 01:23:27.549
(gentle music continues)

1762
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:28.842
It's perfect.

1763
01:23:31.177 --> 01:23:32.679
- Decided. then?

1764
01:23:32.721 --> 01:23:34.681
- It's decided.

1765
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:37.767
(gentle music)

1766
01:23:39.561 --> 01:23:41.229
No. you're right. Right here.
