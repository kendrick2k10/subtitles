00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.973
(fire crackling)

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.870
(intense ethereal music)

6
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.472
(dramatic instrumental music)

7
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.668
(electricity crackling)

8
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.628
- [Vincent] I'm from a
different metropolis.

9
00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.756
another city far away from here.

10
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.218
but I've been in Marfa a long time

11
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.681
and I refuse to accept
this town as the end.

12
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.640
as my end.

13
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.351
I need to leave here.

14
00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.646
I need to leave Marfa.

15
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.649
And I know that my old friend
will struggle with that.

16
00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.942
even fight me on it.

17
00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:33.027
That's all right.

18
00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:38.783
Leaving here isn't going
to be easy for any of us.

19
00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.786
(tense piano music)

20
00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.504
We have a habit of trusting in fate.

21
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.216
that things are out of our control.

22
00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:58.803
Me? I don't think so.

23
00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.848
I don't think that's the case.

24
00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.893
I don't think it's over for me.

25
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.895
Not yet.

26
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.358
(wind rustling)

27
00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.662
(easygoing music)

28
00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.132
- Two. three. four. five. six. seven.

29
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.635
- [Vincent] Meet Matthew Bench.

30
00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:42.472
Now this guy pretends his fortune teller

31
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:43.640
helps him lead the way

32
00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.642
in everything.

33
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.810
Can't make a decision without it.

34
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.562
But the truth is.

35
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.564
I don't think even he believes it.

36
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.529
Then there's Erik Streett. the quiet one.

37
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.492
Uh-huh. never in a big hurry.

38
00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.618
He goes with the flow.

39
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.204
but he's definitely unpredictable.

40
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.085
Eden Percell.

41
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.089
Obsessed with her cell phone.

42
00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.385
I guess she's really curious.

43
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.220
Okay. who am I kidding?

44
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.764
She's an odd one for sure.

45
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.395
Allie Holliwell.

46
00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.939
Yep.

47
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.108
She's a Looker for sure.

48
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.068
Full of one-liners too.

49
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:37.902
Funny.

50
00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.153
Kind of. Sort of.

51
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.447
On her good days anyway.

52
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.033
- Great song. huh?

53
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.952
- Yeah. it's good the first 78 times.

54
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:46.869
- Oh. come on. man.

55
00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:47.704
Don't be like that.

56
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.706
You can never get enough of a good song.

57
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.957
- Okay guys. this is my first
weekend out in a long time.

58
00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:53.835
other than books. my brother. and BF's.

59
00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.087
and I'm actually having fun.

60
00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.589
What did you think about
our first tequila cook off?

61
00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.551
- It's Terlingua cook off.

62
00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.387
You quote hypotheses about
scientific law and theory

63
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.390
and a lot of crap people don't understand.

64
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.100
but you can't get Terlingua
out of your mouth?

65
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.393
- [Erik] Enough. Allie.

66
00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.436
Just relax.

67
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.855
Knock it off. princess.

68
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.148
- Okay. so Matt. did you have fun

69
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.316
at that Terlingua cook off?

70
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.859
- There you go.

71
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.110
- I don't know.

72
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.278
Let's ask my fortune teller.

73
00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.030
(eerie music)

74
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.031
Did I have a good time?
- I thought those things

75
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.074
just tell you yes. no. or maybe?

76
00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.410
- Nope. Mine is special.

77
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.287
Boop. boop. boop. boop. boop.

78
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.121
Boop.

79
00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:31.831
What does it say?

80
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.082
It says that

81
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.755
quite possibly the best
trip I've ever had.

82
00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.423
And I agree.

83
00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.925
(Eden laughs)

84
00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:46.220
And Eden. I'm proud of you.

85
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.139
You actually got out of
your own little world

86
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.599
and actually. you know.

87
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.392
joined the human race
and talked with people.

88
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:53.061
It was nice.
- Okay. yeah. okay.

89
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.020
You know what?

90
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.521
Not all of us can be in our junior year

91
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.732
and clueless about what we
wanna do with our lives.

92
00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:00.026
Some of us have to. I don't know.

93
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.652
you know. plan our life.

94
00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:02.487
- I'm not clueless.

95
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.530
I'm just searching for myself.

96
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.617
Sir. Erik.

97
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:12.330
Erik. what did you think
of the tequila cook off?

98
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.456
- Oh. you know.

99
00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.791
I think it was pretty kick-ass

100
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.417
but a little hard to remember

101
00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.169
with Eden's phone in my face.

102
00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.046
Why do you have to record

103
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.881
every single moment of your life anyway?

104
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.174
You know it's probably
just gonna come back

105
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.593
and haunt us all someday.

106
00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.136
Just chill.

107
00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:28.262
- [Allie] Word.

108
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.431
- Everyone. shh. shh. shh.

109
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.058
See. Eden?

110
00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:34.811
There's no such thing
as an awkward silence.

111
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.105
- (laughs) It's awkward if Edie is silent.

112
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.648
- Oh. okay. yeah.

113
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:39.482
I'm the social one

114
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.900
who always has something to say.

115
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.943
Yeah. all right.

116
00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.528
You sure about that. Allie?

117
00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.779
- Silence!

118
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.364
We've got a pit stop coming up ahead.

119
00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:49.283
but the question is. should we stop?

120
00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:50.784
Shall we?

121
00:06:50.784 --> 00:06:53.329
- Do you really have to ask
that thing that question?

122
00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.455
- Oh. we do. we do.

123
00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:55.957
- Or. you know. any questions at all?

124
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.417
- We absolutely do

125
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.793
and if anyone cares.

126
00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:02.296
it says that we should
keep it moving. people.

127
00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.840
- Oh. oh. oh!

128
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.841
I think we should stop

129
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.969
because Matt's little
friend here tells us so.

130
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.053
- All right. fine.

131
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.681
Don't come to me.

132
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.224
Don't say that I didn't warn ya.

133
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.309
- Good. 'cause I've had to take a leak

134
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.894
since last Thanksgiving.

135
00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:19.522
Something your little piece
of paper didn't predict.

136
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:22.942
- Mind over bladder. Erik.

137
00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.902
Simply mind over bladder.

138
00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:25.862
- Okay. Allie.

139
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.822
I'll remember that next
time you have to go.

140
00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.866
(easygoing music)

141
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.744
- [Vincent] These four. they
really look out for each other.

142
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.374
And that. that was reason enough for me.

143
00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:40.126
♪ Who do you think you are ♪

144
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.378
♪ You're on top ♪

145
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:45.256
So. let's go back.

146
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.634
(music warbling)

147
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:51.471
Let me show you how we
found ourselves right here.

148
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.224
(eerie music)

149
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.277
- [Waitress] How about a
cup of pitch-black brew?

150
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:09.906
- Hit me with the jet fuel.

151
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:12.742
I'm gonna need it.

152
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:18.122
You've worked here ever
since I entered Marfa.

153
00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.457
- [Waitress] Yes. I have.

154
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.879
- You ever think about leaving?

155
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:29.258
- Every day.

156
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.474
Good morning. Mr. Mayor.

157
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.142
Would you like some coffee?

158
00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:40.144
(Mayor inhales deeply)

159
00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:40.977
- No. thank you.

160
00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:58.371
- It cannot go on like this.

161
00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.705
- What are you talking about?

162
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.165
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

163
00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:02.667
- You know...

164
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.878
How many times do we have to go over this?

165
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.171
- Until you understand.

166
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.340
- Look. they're here.

167
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.093
they're home. and they're safe.

168
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.346
(tense music)

169
00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:16.180
- Are they?

170
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.014
- Yeah.

171
00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:19.559
Where the hell else are they gonna go?

172
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.311
(paper rustling)

173
00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:30.152
- Anywhere but here.

174
00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:35.449
- You know what. Vincent?

175
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.285
I'm beginning to think

176
00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.995
that you don't really understand

177
00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:39.996
what's going on here.

178
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.664
- I understand all too well.

179
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.374
Stop trying to keep them here.

180
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:44.584
They have free will

181
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.129
and you need to let them move on.

182
00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:51.382
- Okay.

183
00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:57.263
(Mayor sighs)

184
00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.806
- Have a good day.

185
00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:00.266
- Thank you.

186
00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.768
(eerie music)

187
00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.693
- This one's on me.

188
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.179
- [Vincent] Okay.

189
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:41.182
So. let's pick up right where we left off.

190
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:46.562
(music warbling)

191
00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:49.190
♪ I'm not getting in my way ♪

192
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.195
♪ I'm getting in my lonely lonely way ♪

193
00:10:56.614 --> 00:11:00.034
♪ And who knows that I hide the things ♪

194
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.702
♪ I want to share with you. ♪

195
00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:04.580
- This is fancy.
- This is cute. Look at this.

196
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.499
(tense music)

197
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.335
(wrench clicking)

198
00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.050
(bell dinging)

199
00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.013
Look at this.

200
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.018
Hey. get us some drinks. girls.

201
00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.353
Have them put 40.

202
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.022
- Okay.
- Pump three.

203
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:32.983
Put it in there.

204
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.405
Wow. love this thing. Look at that.

205
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:38.239
Man.

206
00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:42.660
- [Vincent] And this.

207
00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:44.912
this is where we first met.

208
00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:49.417
- I feel like we're on the
edge of the earth out here.

209
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.712
It's more like the to-kill-ya
cook off at this point.

210
00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.631
It's like time has stopped.

211
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.135
We can't find our way out.

212
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.094
- Seriously. man?

213
00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:02.888
This trip must be really.
really long for you

214
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.807
if you're coming up with
lame crap like that.

215
00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:08.644
Is that a brontosaurus?

216
00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:10.855
(static crackling)

217
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.524
(flies buzzing)

218
00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.120
- I need to put 40 on pump three. please.

219
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.707
- [Cashier] They don't
let me handle the money.

220
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.834
They say I have sticky fingers.

221
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.336
(eerie music)

222
00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:41.260
- Well. what do you girls need?

223
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.432
- Well. we were just asking Wilmer here

224
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.266
if we could have-

225
00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.893
- Wilmer doesn't work here anymore.

226
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.524
- Then why does it say Wilmer on his tag?

227
00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.488
(Allie chuckles)

228
00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:06.285
Well then. that's a good move on Wilmer.

229
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.871
- Well. it weren't really his choice

230
00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:12.082
being that Wilmer's dead and all.

231
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.588
(eerie music)
(flies buzzing)

232
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:18.631
- Got any drinks?

233
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.673
- Oh. sure do.

234
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:26.222
(laughs) Hey. there's
my other set of teeth.

235
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.389
Been wondering where they were.

236
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.557
now here they are.

237
00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:32.061
Well. take what you need.

238
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.979
Our selection is sort of small.

239
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.398
but all we got is real cold.

240
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:37.817
- I can't believe this is happening.

241
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.401
This is unbelievable.

242
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.361
- Well. cold works.

243
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.488
We need four drinks.
- All right.

244
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.907
- If you got 'em.
- Go ahead.

245
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.539
There you are.

246
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.915
Your four sody-pops.

247
00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.458
(Eden laughs)

248
00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:55.751
- Oh my God.

249
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.672
I haven't seen one of
these since I was a kid.

250
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:00.631
I saw one of these

251
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.258
in those black and white movies

252
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.968
at my Nanny and Poppy's house.

253
00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:08.055
I loved it 'cause it would creep me out.

254
00:14:08.055 --> 00:14:09.473
- [Eden] What is this thing?

255
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.600
- I just remember seeing it

256
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.644
in those old black and white movies.

257
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:17.481
It would answer yes or no questions.

258
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:19.400
Tell you your future.

259
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.860
Kind of scary.

260
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.069
- I tell you what.

261
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:23.571
Sometimes it's best not to know

262
00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.780
what your fortune holds.

263
00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:26.574
Leave it alone.

264
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.536
Well. I'll tell you what.

265
00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.292
(hand slams)

266
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.126
Or not.

267
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:40.421
- Come on. let's get out of here. Allie.

268
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.964
- I'm willing to take a chance.

269
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.425
What do I have to lose?

270
00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:48.220
What does our future hold?

271
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.140
- Mm. I thought it answered
only yes or no questions.

272
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.851
Come on. enough of this nonsense.

273
00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:54.685
We gotta roll.

274
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.695
(machine buzzing)

275
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:10.242
Come on. Allie. Let's go.

276
00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:30.930
- Hey. I'll be right back.

277
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.764
I gotta take a piss

278
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.849
before we get back on
this highway to hell.

279
00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:34.808
- Don't fall in.

280
00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:40.314
- Who says it isn't a highway to heaven?

281
00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:41.649
(eerie music)

282
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.400
- Dude. look around.

283
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.402
If heaven looks anything like this.

284
00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:46.362
I'm not interested.

285
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:50.115
- Maybe it's more than just a highway.

286
00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.618
All depends where you wanna go.

287
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.579
- [Erik] Exactly where is it
that you're looking to go?

288
00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.413
- Just Marfa.

289
00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.165
- Good luck with that.

290
00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:00.167
We need to get home.

291
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.587
- Good luck to you. too.

292
00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:07.007
I hope that home is where you end up.

293
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.137
- Not sure what that means.

294
00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:14.723
That's exactly where we're headed.

295
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.105
(tense piano music)

296
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.441
- [Matthew] Buddy. do you have orange?

297
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:25.359
All righty.

298
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:29.071
Sitting in this here captain's seat.

299
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.907
(voices warbling)

300
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:39.790
What's this crazy person
doing around here?

301
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.335
I've never seen him before in my life.

302
00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.211
They do say that.

303
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.045
- Excuse me.

304
00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:46.422
- [Matthew] Hey. did it all flow well?

305
00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.048
Was it good?
- Always.

306
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:54.471
- Hey. Erik. you still good to drive. man?

307
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.973
- Heck yeah. dude.

308
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.142
- All right.

309
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.729
Bye. dinosaur.
- Let's go.

310
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.688
(bright guitar music)

311
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.731
- [Matthew] Goodbye.

312
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:04.940
Drive right through it.

313
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.734

317
00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:23.291
You know. he was totally
flirting with you.

318
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:25.461
- Wait. wait. wait. What
guy was flirting with you?

319
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:26.627
- [Matthew] Yeah. what
are y'all talking about?

320
00:17:26.627 --> 00:17:29.673
- Yeah. that cashier was
a straight up creeper.

321
00:17:29.673 --> 00:17:31.467
- Well. if you didn't
dress like a stripper.

322
00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.052
men wouldn't be throwing quarters at you.

323
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.262

324
00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:37.264

pretty weak out here.

With a body like yours.

329
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:45.939
you should've gotten
much more than quarters.

330
00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:46.774
- Ew. gross!

331
00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:47.983

with that fortune teller
ticket thing said.

343
00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:24.895
- Whoa. wait a minute.

344
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.021
There's another fortune teller

345
00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.231
and you're giving me trouble about mine?

346
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.607
- Yeah. well maybe because yours

347
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.150
is made out of paper.

348
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.193
- [Matthew] It doesn't
matter what it's made out of

349
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.570
as long as it's giving you the
answers you're looking for.

350
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.404
- Okay.

351
00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.948
- Wait. wait. was there seriously
a fortune teller in there

352
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.783
or are you just messing with me?

353
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:41.328
- It was just a stupid toy
sitting on the counter.

354
00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:44.414
I don't wanna think about
that creepy place again.

355
00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:46.458
- You know. speaking of creepy.

356
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.919
my grandmother had a crystal ball.

357
00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.587
She would leave it outside on a full moon

358
00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:52.381
claiming it would recharge

359
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:53.799
and pull energy from Mother Earth.

360
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.050
- Shut up. I don't believe
in all that crazy stuff.

361
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.927
Come on.
- No. seriously.

362
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.428
People would pay her for her predictions.

363
00:18:58.428 --> 00:18:59.972
You know. even local police agencies

364
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.181
would have her profile killers

365
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.392
to help solve crime scenes.

366
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.018
- You believe in all that
crap when you're studying

367
00:19:05.018 --> 00:19:07.187
the scientific approach in forensics?

368
00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:08.522
- What does that even mean?

369
00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.274
- Dead men tell a tale.

370
00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.317
You know. possibly in more ways than one.

371
00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.444
The Indians believed in astral travel.

372
00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:16.446
- I believe in assholes traveling.

373
00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.574
We got two in the front
row seats right now.

374
00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:20.701
- [Matthew] Oh. shots fired!

375
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.911
- No. I'm being serious. guys.

376
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:24.121
Okay. you know when you fall asleep

377
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:25.706
and your body jumps?
- Yeah.

378
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.374
- Okay. so the Indians believed

379
00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:29.501
that your spirit's
traveling outside your body

380
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.128
and at that very moment
when your body jumps.

381
00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.589
your spirit is jumping
right back into your body.

382
00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.721
- [Erik] Hey. look.

383
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.472
The Marfa ghost lights.

384
00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:43.849
- [Matthew] I bet that's about as real

385
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.351
as your grandmother's crystal ball.

386
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:49.271
- [Erik] Hey. maybe we can
stay the night there. huh?

387
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.857
The Marfa sign says it's just up the road.

388
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.192
- [Matthew] Let me consult

389
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.527
with the fortune teller in the car.

390
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.487
(eerie music)

391
00:19:57.487 --> 00:19:58.780
Oh. too bad.

392
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.116
It says that we should not stop.

393
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:02.409
- Knock it off. Matt.

394
00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.745
Quit letting a piece of
paper dictate your future.

395
00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.330
- [Matthew] Hey. it was
right about the gas station

396
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.414
and that turned out creepy.

397
00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:08.999
- Okay. so it says Marfa.

398
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.959
It's a town of 2.000.

399
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:14.922
It has art and culture and
a historical courthouse.

400
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:15.756
And most importantly.

401
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.466
a place to pull over for the night.

402
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:21.428
And something about mystery ghost lights.

403
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:23.263
Whatever.

404
00:20:23.263 --> 00:20:24.389
I say we check things out.

405
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:27.935
- I'm up for the adventure.

406
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:28.769
- [Matthew] Okay.

407
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.312
Don't say I didn't warn you not to.

408
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.900
(eerie music)

409
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.277
- Hey. look. it's the guy
from back at the gas station.

410
00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:38.362
the one with the scar.

411
00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:41.281
- How'd he get here before us?

412
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.699
I mean. he said he was
on his way to Marfa.

413
00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:46.453
but he seemed really. real
confused that. you know?

414
00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.748
- Well then let's just pick him up.

415
00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:51.625
- See?

416
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.210
We met him for a reason.

417
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.628
He's just another sign telling us

418
00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:56.421
we should go to Marfa.

419
00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.465
- I know we shouldn't be
picking up hitchhikers

420
00:20:58.465 --> 00:21:00.300
and he isn't exactly wholesome looking.

421
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.219
but you only live once.

422
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.804
- Fortune teller says that
we should pick him up.

423
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.347
- Not you too.

424
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.431
- [Matthew] I'm just saying. man.

425
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.642
the fortune teller agrees with the ladies.

426
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:09.893
It must be okay.

427
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.312
- Please?

428
00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:14.064
- [Erik] All right.
well. if we get murdered.

429
00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.565
I'm gonna be very upset with all of you.

430
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:17.442
- Nice turn.
- Yeah.

431
00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.694
- [Matthew] Nice turn.

432
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:21.405
(all cheering)

433
00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.491

434
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.994
(eerie music)

435
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:03.864
- Hey. get in.

436
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:04.781
We're heading into town.

437
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.199
- Be glad to join you.

438
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.243
- Whoa.

439
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.536
What in the world was that?

440
00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:10.370
- [Allie] Whoa.

441
00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.833
- Welcome to Marfa.

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:23.842

500
00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:08.006
- Y'all come on in. Grab a booth.

501
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:19.059
All right. here we go.

502
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:21.019

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:21.853
Okay.

504
00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:24.064
We don't want anybody
dyin' on us around here.

00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:25.148
- Well. we're actually on our way home

506
00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:28.151

507
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:29.152
Does that count?

508
00:25:29.152 --> 00:25:30.695
- Stop with the to-kill-ya. would ya?

509
00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.030
It wasn't funny the first time.

510
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.490
- So I think we should stay

511
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.075
and check out these lights
everyone's talking about.

512
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:35.909
- Oh.

513
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.661
Y'all are here to see the lights.

514
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:38.995

Shh.

518
00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:46.378
I said shh!

519
00:25:47.295 --> 00:25:48.129
Let me tell you something

520
00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:49.089
about those lights.
- There's nothing

521
00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.340
to the lights. I'm telling you.

522
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.633
Nothing at all.

523
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.344
- People say that it's
the souls of the dead

524
00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:56.721
that are refusing to just pass on.

525
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.723
You know. they're just hanging out.

526
00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.892
- What does that even mean?

527
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.519
- Yeah. really. (laughs)

528
00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:05.480
(man laughing)

529
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.524
- There's nothing to the lights.

530
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.526
Most folks can't even see them.

531
00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:10.986
- Well. those that have

532
00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:14.114
sure think they're beautiful.

533
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:17.784
(waitress chuckles)

534
00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:19.869
- [Eden] Ma'am. have you
yourself ever seen the lights?

535
00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:21.288
- Oh. honey.

536
00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:22.581
I see them every day.

537
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.874
- She does not.

538
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.961
- I'm with the old guy.

539
00:26:27.961 --> 00:26:30.589
I think it's a hoax or an urban legend.

540
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.382
Every small town in America has one.

541
00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.600
- Old guy?

542
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:44.686
Old guy. huh?

543
00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:49.733
Smells to me like you
drink your own bath water.

544
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.569
Y'all be careful out there.

545
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:57.574
- All right.

546
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.579
- Okay. here we go.
- Thank you.

547
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:03.580
- [Waitress] Honey. are you okay?

548
00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.458
You look like death warmed over.

549
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.251
And what have you done to your neck?

550
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:10.754
- [Matthew] Erik.

551
00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:11.963
- [Allie] Let me see. Erik.

552
00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:15.008
It's dried blood. What'd you do?

553
00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:16.843
- I have no idea.

554
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.764
I'll go take a look.

555
00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:25.560
- Matt. I think you oughta drive

556
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.936
the rest of the way home.

557
00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:28.938
Erik isn't looking too good.

558
00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:30.273
- Yeah. I agree.

559
00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:35.320
- So I think we should stay

560
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.696
and check out the lights

561
00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:39.199
and maybe some of the art.

562
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.284
You know. after all. we are here.

563
00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:42.869
- You did say when in Rome. right?

564
00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:45.080
- Oh. Edie. that's so you.

565
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.206
Always so curious.

566
00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:48.208
always wanting the
unexplained explained to you.

567
00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:49.417
- Get off.

568
00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:50.710
(Allie laughs)

569
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.630
(soft eerie music)

570
00:27:58.134 --> 00:28:02.097
- [Vincent] Waiting. watching. listening.

571
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.058
but it's getting late now.

572
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.983
- You again?

573
00:28:13.983 --> 00:28:16.403
Why do we keep bumping into you?

574
00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:17.237
- Who knows?

575
00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:18.655
Maybe our paths were meant to cross.

576
00:28:19.572 --> 00:28:21.574
- Or maybe we were simply meant

577
00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:23.868
to give you a ride into town.

578
00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:24.703
- Could be.

579
00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:27.706
I guess only time will tell.

580
00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:33.753
(water dribbling)

581
00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:43.138
(eerie music)

582
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.103
(dishes clattering)

583
00:28:57.485 --> 00:28:59.654
- I see you're still here.

584
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.406
- For now I am.

585
00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:04.826
- Vincent. I see how you've been preying

586
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:06.202
on these four young ones.

587
00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:07.829
- I'm not preying on anyone.

588
00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:09.873
- I see what you're doing.

589
00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:13.084
I just want you to just
leave them be. all right?

590
00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:14.085
They belong here.

591
00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:18.131
- They can decide that for themselves

592
00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:20.049
and I'm not gonna stand in their way.

593
00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.509
- I don't think you truly understand

594
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:22.719
what's going on here.

595
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.388
- I don't know what you're talking about.

596
00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:26.765
- You can't change what is.

597
00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:30.810

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:46.242
The Day of the Dead festival

604
00:29:46.242 --> 00:29:48.161
and they got a fat Elvis!

605
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.580
- Well. I guess all
the conspiracy theories

606
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.166
about me being alive are correct.

607
00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.834

- Yeah. it's great.
- Oh. yep.

619
00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:41.798
They're definitely celebrating the dead.

620
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:43.675
- Yeah. looks more like
a bunch of freaks to me.

621
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:44.717
- Come on. Erik.

622
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.052
The King's here.

623
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:50.890
- I say we get our faces painted.

624
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.851
I mean. there's gotta be face painting.

625
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:53.893
We should find it.

626
00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:56.104
- What. in this heat? Are you crazy?

627
00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:56.938
- Okay.

628
00:30:56.938 --> 00:31:00.191
So it says DOD is celebrated in Mexico

629
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:02.402
and around the world in many cultures.

630
00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:03.778
It focuses on the honoring

631
00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:05.905
dead friends and family members.

632
00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:06.739
Oh gosh.

633
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.409
Well. come on. Erik.

634
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:12.579
This might be our last trip
together as a foursome.

635
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:13.872
- I think y'all might need some advice

636
00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:14.956
from a fortune teller here.

637
00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:17.959
- Um. we're good.
- Don't count on it. Matt.

638
00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:20.169
You need to put that toy away.

639
00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:21.004
- Fine.

640
00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.213
It's not like you're listening to it.

641
00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:24.549
- Are y'all going somewhere
I don't know about?

642
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.508
- Uh. duh.

643
00:31:25.508 --> 00:31:27.010
It's called life.

644
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.428
And before you know it we'll be adulting

645
00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:29.679
and going our separate directions.

646
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.681
- Come on. we've been friends
way too long for that.

647
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:32.849
You know better.

648
00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:34.851
- Edie has a point about that. Erik.

649
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.478
I mean. maybe it's just time
that the diapers come off.

650
00:31:37.478 --> 00:31:39.147
the training wheels come off.

651
00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:42.358
(sighs) It's gonna happen.

652
00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:43.276
- Speak for yourself.

653
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:44.819
- Oh yeah. you still wear diapers.

654
00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:46.821
- [Matthew] It just makes life easier.

655
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:48.239
- I'll visit you at the home.

656
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.454
- Today is one of my
favorite days of the year.

657
00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:56.080
- Oh yeah?

658
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.373
Why's that?

659
00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:59.834
- It feels like I'm
honoring my grandparents.

660
00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:01.711
my ancestors.

661
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:02.545
- Excuse me. ma'am.

662
00:32:02.545 --> 00:32:04.172
Do you have space for four more?

663
00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:05.882
- [Vincent] Yes. we do.

664
00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:06.716
I'm on it.

665
00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:09.135
I'm gonna get you guys a little DODed.

666
00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:10.011
- DODed?

667
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:10.929
What does that mean?

668
00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:12.680
- I think it means Day of the Deaded up.

669
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.514
- This is Day of the Dead

670
00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:14.641
not night of the living dead. right?

671
00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:17.352
- Yeah. I'm not so sure
there's a difference.

672
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:18.895
- Hey. Vincent. it's you.

673
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:20.271
- Wow. she's really perceptive.

674
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.522
Yes. it is.
- Here we go again.

675
00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:23.775
- I didn't know you were a face painter.

676
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.652
- I didn't know I was
gonna be working today.

677
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:26.986
- [Erik] What do you mean by that?

678
00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:28.321
(gentle piano music)

679
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:29.948
- Yes.

680
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.824
We must always remember.

681
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:32.659
- Exactly.

682
00:32:34.744 --> 00:32:35.578
- Uh. just that.

683
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:38.998
I was gonna pay you back
for giving me a ride.

684
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:40.833
- [Erik] Gee. thanks.

685
00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:41.668
- You're welcome.

686
00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:51.594
- [Little Girl] What's wrong?

687
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:54.806
- Nothing.

688
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:01.312
- Come on. come on.

689
00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:02.271
You got four of us to work on.

690
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:04.023
- I'm all over it.

691
00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:06.109
Just gotta make sure it's done right.

692
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:07.026
Look the other way.

693
00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.028
That way.

694
00:33:09.028 --> 00:33:09.862
- Oh.

695
00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:10.697
Hey.

696
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.824
- [Vincent] Why do you have three eyes?

697
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.325
Hold on a second.

698
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.535

709
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.918
Come on. where's your skills at?

710
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.802

friend's lives in great danger.

711
00:34:14.802 --> 00:34:16.344
And they don't know. do they?

712
00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.725
And neither do you.

713
00:34:23.393 --> 00:34:24.771
Look inside yourself.

00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:25.938
Find your spirit.

715
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.440
Confront him.

716
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.194
And only then will you have the answer

717
00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:32.820
that will truly set you free.

718
00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:37.283
Live for today and tomorrow never comes.

719
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:41.621
- I wonder if she has Saturday's

720
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:43.081
winning lottery numbers. huh?

721
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:01.682
- But I want a picture.

722
00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:04.435
Say Marfa.

723
00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:06.395
- Marfa.

724
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:15.988
- Hey.

725
00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:17.490
Okay. so it's Matt's pocket.

726
00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:20.451
gas stations. and gypsy booths.

727
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:23.121
They're everywhere.

728
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.997
I feel like we're in a traveling circus.

729
00:35:24.997 --> 00:35:26.249
It's like revenge of the fortune tellers.

730
00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:28.835
(Allie laughs)

731
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.338
(tense music)

732
00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:51.399
- Man.

733
00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:54.318
How are we gonna get this crap off?

734
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.906
- Nothing a little turpentine
and steel wool can't remove.

735
00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:01.325
- Um. you might not like your face.

736
00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.869
I however. am attached to mine.

737
00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.246
- Man. I'm wore out.

738
00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:07.790
Too much sun or something.

739
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:10.251
- Take a hot shower.

740
00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:12.670
You'll feel better.

741
00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:15.131
You'll definitely smell better.

742
00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:21.846
(Allie sighs)

743
00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.386
- Anyone got service?

744
00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.763
I got nothing on this thing.

745
00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:08.851
- Matt. we're lucky we
got water and electricity.

746
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:11.103
- Surely they have wifi
here though. come on.

747
00:37:12.104 --> 00:37:13.814
- You want some room service with that?

748
00:37:13.814 --> 00:37:15.441
- [Matthew] Yes. please.

749
00:37:15.441 --> 00:37:16.275
You never know.

750
00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:19.362
Hey Edie. why don't you
call the front desk.

751
00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:20.363
ask if they got some wifi.

752
00:37:20.363 --> 00:37:21.364
get us the password?

753
00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:24.325
- [Woman On TV] They oughta
make the day and the time

754
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.661
change on the first day of summer.

755
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:29.205
- [Eden] Yes. could you
tell me the wifi password?

756
00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:30.665
- You can't be serious. Edie.

757
00:37:35.002 --> 00:37:37.505
- [Mysterious Voice] It's because of you.

758
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:39.257
Go to the lights.

759
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.091
- Y'all quit!

760
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:42.551
Quit messing with me.

761
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.268
- I heard them pick up and
now I can't hear anything.

762
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.728
- [Man On TV] Is there
any of that candy left?

763
00:37:52.728 --> 00:37:53.938
- Well. you called it. Allie.

764
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.022
They don't have a phone that works.

765
00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:56.107
let alone internet service.

766
00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.317
- We still remember.
- I don't.

767
00:38:02.321 --> 00:38:04.490
- [Mysterious Voice] Erik.

768
00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.119
- Oh.

769
00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:11.414
Dude. I haven't seen you move
that fast in a long time.

770
00:38:11.414 --> 00:38:13.291
- [Allie] I take it the
shower didn't help any.

771
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.875
- Something's not right.

772
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:16.460
I'm not feeling well.

773
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.503
- Maybe it has something to do

774
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:20.589
with that foot long sausage
on a stick you had earlier.

775
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:21.882
- That's real funny.

776
00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:23.759
- [Mathew] I'm just saying.

777
00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:24.593
I'm just saying. man.

778
00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:26.387
Come on. put some clothes on. would ya?

779
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:27.513
- We've had a long few days.

780
00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:28.889
We're all just tired.

781
00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:29.724
- I'm not sick or tired.

782
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:31.851
I just...

783
00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:34.437
I don't feel like myself at all.

784
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:35.813
- All right.

785
00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.898
We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.

786
00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:40.276
Come on. the paper fortune teller

787
00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:42.028
told us we shouldn't
even be here. all right?

788
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.654
We should've listened to it.

789
00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:45.114
- Matt. I'm gonna shove that thing

790
00:38:45.114 --> 00:38:46.282
where the sun don't shine.

791
00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:47.366
- I'm just saying.

792
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:51.746
- We can't just leave without seeing

793
00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:53.622
what those ghost lights are all about.

794
00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:58.336
- Are you sure?

795
00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.671
We don't have to see the ghosts lights.

796
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.173
If you're not feeling well.

797
00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.091
we can go home in the morning.

798
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:05.760
- If we didn't see those darn lights.

799
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.844
you'd drive the whole way home

800
00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:09.638
while being this close
and not seeing them?

801
00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:11.932
I'd rather see them sick as a dog

802
00:39:11.932 --> 00:39:13.267
than watch you pout the whole way home.

803
00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:15.019
- I wouldn't pout the whole way home.

804
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.604
(Allie chuckles)

805
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:18.230
Like maybe half of it.

806
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.733
- And from every trip on.

807
00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:21.901
Edie. you and I both know

808
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:23.527
as soon as those Christmas lights come on.

809
00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:24.862
you're gonna get triggered.

810
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.823
Those traffic lights are gonna change

811
00:39:27.823 --> 00:39:28.991
and you're just gonna think about

812
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:31.369
all of the Marfa lights you're missing.

813
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.329
(Allie and Erik laughing)

814
00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:34.205
- [Man On TV] I wonder what happened

815
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.582
to the one from last year.

816
00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:39.293
Each year we spend good
money on these things.

817
00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:41.796
(eerie music)

818
00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:48.052
- Well. well. who do we have here?

819
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:51.639
- Who?

820
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:57.061
- It's the two cashiers
from the gas station.

821
00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:59.313
but there's a third guy
standing beside them.

822
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:01.857
He must be Wilmer.

823
00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:05.319
He's actually wearing
his own shirt this time.

824
00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.490
- Why is a picture of them in here?

825
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:19.875

845
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:15.533
At this point any bit of
light would be welcome.

846
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:18.410
- Yeah. I'm not really
expecting to see any lights.

847
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.703
And if we do.

848
00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.622
I'm honestly not
expecting them to be much.

849
00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:22.456
- Who cares?

850
00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:24.458
It's not like we'd be doing anything else.

851
00:42:25.292 --> 00:42:28.128
- You mean. other than standing
in the middle of nowhere?

852
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:32.424
- Guys. let's just give it a minute. okay?

853
00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:34.677
It's got me really curious.

854
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:35.678
- Ooh.

855
00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:37.805
- [Man In The Dark] Give it some time.

856
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:39.723
I've given it years.

857
00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:43.477
When you're ready for them

858
00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:44.436
you'll see them.

859
00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.772
- What the heck?

860
00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:50.609
- Uh. God. is that you?

861
00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:51.735
(eerie music)

862
00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.362
- Okay. what's going on?

863
00:42:53.362 --> 00:42:54.822
We can't even see who we're talking to.

864
00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.949
- [Man In The Dark] The point is

865
00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:58.826
it doesn't even matter who I am.

866
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:03.289
Just be open and willing to listen.

867
00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:06.041
- Your ability to attract
weirdos is unparalleled.

868
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:08.168
I've literally never
seen anything like it.

869
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:09.420
- [Man In The Dark] There's
more to these lights

870
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.255
than we see.

871
00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.549
more than we know or willing to accept.

872
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:16.719
Most can't see them and those few who do

873
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:19.430
can't begin to explain them.

874
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.849
Maybe they're here to guide us.

875
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.351
to help us take a step back.

876
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.895
and think about the big picture.

877
00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:31.567
that everything has a
beginning and an end.

878
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.361
- Okay.

879
00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:36.822
I'll take that as your
opinion and nothing else.

880
00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:38.949
- [Man In The Dark] Maybe or maybe not.

881
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:43.871
The light shines in the darkness

882
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.749
and the darkness has never understood it.

883
00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:48.751
You're searching.

884
00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.670
You all came here for a reason.

885
00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:53.631
Be patient.

886
00:43:54.923 --> 00:43:56.842
You'll see them soon enough.

887
00:43:58.093 --> 00:43:59.428
- [Matthew] What does that even mean?

888
00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:00.679
- Exactly. Matt.

889
00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:03.515
What the heck does that even mean?

890
00:44:03.515 --> 00:44:05.726
Oh. wait.

891
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:08.687
Do you mean those lights out there?

892
00:44:08.687 --> 00:44:09.605
- [Erik] Shut up. Allie.

893
00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:11.899
He's trying to tell us something.

894
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.317
- Okay. Allie. look.

895
00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.151
you know as well as I do

896
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.235
that those lights you're pointing at

897
00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:16.820
are a bunch of idiots on
their cell phones. okay?

898
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.655
It's not funny.

899
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:29.583
Do you guys remember
what that waitress said?

900
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:30.417
- [Allie] What?

901
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:35.172
- Something about souls

902
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.132
and them refusing to move on

903
00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:38.217
and them hanging out.

904
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:41.011
- [Matthew] Oh. right.

905
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.639
Yeah. she was talking about
the souls of the dead. right?

906
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:45.808
- Yeah. That's. that's it.

907
00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:50.854
- [Man In The Dark] For one
to be open to a new beginning.

908
00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:54.274
one must first come to
terms with one's end.

909
00:44:54.274 --> 00:44:55.609
- Wait!

910
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:56.860
I just saw something.

911
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.695
- [Eden] Where?

912
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.612
- Like over there on the right.

913
00:44:58.612 --> 00:45:00.906
Kind of over the horizon.

914
00:45:00.906 --> 00:45:03.200
It's kind of like they're floating.

915
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.869
- Oh my God. I see them too.

916
00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:08.539
(eerie music)

917
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:09.373
- Wait.

918
00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:10.207
No. I see it too.

919
00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.333
It's right over there.

920
00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:14.128
- Wow.

921
00:45:15.087 --> 00:45:16.922
Are those the Marfa lights
everyone's talking about?

922
00:45:16.922 --> 00:45:18.507
- Well. there's nothing else out that way.

923
00:45:18.507 --> 00:45:20.008
What else could it be?

924
00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:21.093
- How do we know it's not a highway

925
00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:23.470
with a bunch of cars on
it off in the distance?

926
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.346
- There's only one way to find out.

927
00:45:24.346 --> 00:45:27.266
- Erik. what the heck?
Where are you going?

928
00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:29.309
- I'm gonna track these lights down.

929
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:31.145
I bet you someone's screwing with us.

930
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:32.438
- Erik. you're nuts!

931
00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:34.481
I mean. it's pitch black out there.

932
00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:36.150
You don't know what you're stepping on.

933
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.860
- Erik. I'm with ya. I'm coming too!

934
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.403
- Matt!

935
00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:40.821
- [Matthew] Erik!

936
00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:44.992
What are you doing?

937
00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:48.328
(electricity crackling)

938
00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:54.168
- Erik.

939
00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.463
Erik. are you okay?

940
00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:01.675
(heartbeat pounding)

941
00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:04.219
(lights sparking)

942
00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:07.639
(Erik breathing heavily)

943
00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.194
- What just happened?

944
00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:23.947
- Erik.

945
00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:27.367
(soft tense piano music)

946
00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:41.006
(eerie music)

947
00:47:03.362 --> 00:47:06.448
- You know. people in
Marfa talk in circles.

948
00:47:06.448 --> 00:47:07.699
No. not circles.

949
00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:09.034
Soliloquies.

950
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:12.162
Some kind of poetic
verse you can't under...

951
00:47:47.322 --> 00:47:48.657
Hey. are you okay?

952
00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:50.742
- I guess.

953
00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:55.539
- So. I've been thinking.

954
00:47:59.042 --> 00:47:59.877
- Yeah?

955
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:03.505
- Allie and I went to the store today

956
00:48:03.505 --> 00:48:05.841
and bought gemstones. a crystal ball.

957
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:09.511
talked about astral travel and taro cards-

958
00:48:09.511 --> 00:48:10.929
- Yeah. and?

959
00:48:10.929 --> 00:48:11.763
- And.

960
00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:17.019
since being here you've had
some guy following us around.

961
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:20.355
a gypsy tried to tell you your fortune.

962
00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:21.189
you've been hearing someone

963
00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:22.524
whispering to you in the shower.

964
00:48:22.524 --> 00:48:24.693
and now you've been
knocked over by lights.

965
00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:25.903
- Yeah. tell me about it.

966
00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:31.033
What are you getting at?

967
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.456
- I think...

968
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:44.796
I think there's some kind of

969
00:48:44.796 --> 00:48:46.465
spellbound curse on this town.

970
00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:51.720
Maybe voodoo or witchcraft

971
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.971
and the list can keep on

972
00:48:52.971 --> 00:48:54.181
but you get my point.

973
00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.266
- And?

974
00:48:58.727 --> 00:49:00.187
- I gotta show you something.

975
00:49:01.563 --> 00:49:02.981
I discovered this just a few minutes ago.

976
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:05.525
so no one else has seen
this and no one else knows.

977
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:08.320
- Okay.

978
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.321
- I was going over the photos

979
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:10.614
I've taken over the course of this trip

980
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:14.701
and I gotta show you the
one of you with that gypsy.

981
00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:17.329
I think that's where
this whole mess started.

982
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:18.163
It's with her.

983
00:49:18.163 --> 00:49:19.581
- Well you take pictures and videos

984
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:20.666
of everything and everyone.

985
00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:22.584
So. I'm not surprised.

986
00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:24.503
- Okay.

987
00:49:27.547 --> 00:49:29.925
Okay. so remember sitting down with her?

988
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:31.051
- Yes. of course I do.

989
00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:34.429
- And remember how weird she was?

990
00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:35.263
- Yeah.

991
00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:39.559
- Okay. take a look at this picture.

992
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.774
See anything?

993
00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:56.451
- Yeah.

994
00:49:57.577 --> 00:49:59.413
I see two chairs in a booth.

995
00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:00.414
- Yeah.
- What about it?

996
00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:02.708
- Maybe I should've asked
you what you don't see.

997
00:50:07.295 --> 00:50:08.130
- I'm not following. Just tell me.

998
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.464
- What you don't see. Erik.

999
00:50:09.464 --> 00:50:11.967
is neither of you two
sitting in those two chairs.

1000
00:50:13.051 --> 00:50:14.469
You're not in your chair

1001
00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:15.595
and the gypsy isn't in hers.

1002
00:50:15.595 --> 00:50:17.681
but you know as well as
I do y'all were both.

1003
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:19.266
you were both in those two chairs.

1004
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.934
- [Erik] So what?

1005
00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:21.768
- So what?

1006
00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:23.145
So I'm telling you. I know
you were in this picture

1007
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:23.979
when I took it. okay?

1008
00:50:23.979 --> 00:50:26.273
Just. just trust me on this.

1009
00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:27.524
- Okay. I mean.

1010
00:50:30.068 --> 00:50:30.986
I thought I was.

1011
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:34.656
But that doesn't mean the timing was off.

1012
00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:35.782
Maybe you took the picture when we got up.

1013
00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:37.659
- Just take my word for it. Erik.

1014
00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:40.370
You know that gypsy never got up

1015
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.580
the entire time we were there.

1016
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.456
So explain that.

1017
00:50:45.834 --> 00:50:46.668
- Okay.

1018
00:50:48.503 --> 00:50:50.213
Where are you going with all this?

1019
00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:54.718
- Erik. that gypsy cast a spell on you.

1020
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:59.514
(Erik chuckling)

1021
00:50:59.514 --> 00:51:00.348
- Are you serious?

1022
00:51:00.348 --> 00:51:01.933
- I'm being dead serious. Erik.

1023
00:51:01.933 --> 00:51:03.852
You've been weird ever since then.

1024
00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:07.397
I mean. above and beyond your
normal realm of weirdness.

1025
00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:09.024
which is really. really weird.

1026
00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:11.068
- Okay. okay.

1027
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:14.446
Look. you have my attention.

1028
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:15.739
- Oh. well that's a start.

1029
00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:20.118
Let's keep this between you and I.

1030
00:51:20.118 --> 00:51:20.994
Okay?

1031
00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:22.204
Let's get our facts a little straighter

1032
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:23.830
before we clue the other two in.

1033
00:51:24.706 --> 00:51:25.540
- Okay.

1034
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:27.959
I'm not sold on this theory

1035
00:51:27.959 --> 00:51:31.505
just because of a picture
you took of two empty chairs.

1036
00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:34.382
And we're leaving tomorrow anyway. so.

1037
00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.886
(tense music)

1038
00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:55.821
(crow squawking)

1039
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.458
- [Allie] Oh. don't worry. I saw that.

1040
00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.292
- You saw that?
- Mm-hmm.

1041
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:11.044
- Oh hey. look who's headed this way.

1042
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:13.255
- It's the freaks from the gas station.

1043
00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:14.798
- [Eden] Mm-hmm.

1044
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.758
- [Allie] I mean. look at his clothes.

1045
00:52:16.758 --> 00:52:18.385
- Wilmer?
- Yeah. Wilmer!

1046
00:52:18.385 --> 00:52:21.263
- Shh. he might hear you. Allie.

1047
00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:22.639
- Do you think it matters?

1048
00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:25.642
I mean. if we actually ran

1049
00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.227
do you think they'd actually catch up?

1050
00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:28.353
- Yeah. no joke.

1051
00:52:28.353 --> 00:52:30.105
That one dude is still rolling around

1052
00:52:30.105 --> 00:52:32.607
on his little cooler thingy-ma-jig.

1053
00:52:32.607 --> 00:52:34.734
- Okay. is thingy-ma-jig even a real word?

1054
00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:35.902
- It is when you have no other words

1055
00:52:35.902 --> 00:52:37.529
to describe that thing.

1056
00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:38.363
- Yeah. I have a word for you.

1057
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.407
Wacko. straight up wack jobs.

1058
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:43.076
And don't ask me if
that's a real word. Eden.

1059
00:52:43.076 --> 00:52:45.120
I'm pretty sure it's still
in the urban dictionary.

1060
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.538
- No. I'm with you. Allie.

1061
00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:48.665
It definitely fits both of them.

1062
00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.499
- Yeah.

1063
00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:51.251
It's probably safe to say

1064
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:53.962
that their antennas aren't
picking up all the channels.

1065
00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:55.172
- More like nothing at all.

1066
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.006
- Shut up. guys.

1067
00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:57.257
They are way too close

1068
00:52:57.257 --> 00:52:58.592
for y'all to be talking this loud.

1069
00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:00.969
- Do you think it matters?

1070
00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:14.024
- They really are creepy. man.

1071
00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:15.859
I'm so glad they didn't engage.

1072
00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.277
- [Erik] Shoot. we're
lucky they didn't hear us.

1073
00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:18.111
- It's so creepy.

1074
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:19.362
They didn't even say anything at all.

1075
00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:22.991
- Yeah. they were definitely
in their own little worlds.

1076
00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:24.534
Hey. don't turn around.

1077
00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:26.369
Don't even look at those guys again.

1078
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:28.496
- Okay. was it just me

1079
00:53:28.496 --> 00:53:30.790
or did that guy have Wilmer's shirt on?

1080
00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:34.336
I mean. that's pretty weird. guys.

1081
00:53:34.336 --> 00:53:35.837
Totally cray-cray.

1082
00:53:35.837 --> 00:53:37.505
- Why are they even here anyway?

1083
00:53:37.505 --> 00:53:38.506
They don't really seem like the type

1084
00:53:38.506 --> 00:53:40.467
to just be walking around for exercise.

1085
00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:42.052
- Who honestly cares?

1086
00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.595
- Okay. now let's not get
all sentimental about it.

1087
00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:45.096
- Yeah. let's not.

1088
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:47.224
I have an appetite.

1089
00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:48.934
I wanna eat and get out of Marfa.

1090
00:53:51.686 --> 00:53:54.397
(Allie groans)

1091
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:57.150
(paper rustling)

1092
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:00.654
- Hey Tux Man.

1093
00:54:02.447 --> 00:54:04.366
can I have a BLT please?

1094
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:05.200
- A what?

1095
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.076
- A BLT?

1096
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:10.622
- Uh. I guess we can make
you one without the B.

1097
00:54:10.622 --> 00:54:11.831
- What's the B. Tux Man?

1098
00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:14.334
- The B is for bacon. kid.

1099
00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:17.796
- [Little Boy] So just
lettuce and tomato. Tux Man?

1100
00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:18.880
No bacon?

1101
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.173
- That's what I'm saying. kid.

1102
00:54:20.173 --> 00:54:21.591
That's what I'm saying.

1103
00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.593
- What kind of sandwich is that?

1104
00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:25.136
- One with no bacon.

1105
00:54:25.136 --> 00:54:26.596
I got a kebab.

1106
00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.265
I got hummus.

1107
00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:30.350
But I can't make you a BLT.

1108
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.851
I ain't got it.

1109
00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:34.354
You're gonna have to pick
something else out. kid.

1110
00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:38.149
(wind howling)

1111
00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:18.106
- That cute kid wanted
his BLT pretty badly. huh?

1112
00:55:18.106 --> 00:55:20.984
- Yeah. I guess he didn't get
this place has a fancy menu.

1113
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.154
- [Eden] So do you guys think

1114
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:27.324
that man in the dark the
other night was Wilmer?

1115
00:55:27.324 --> 00:55:28.491
Look. he didn't deny it.

1116
00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:29.617
- Who cares?

1117
00:55:29.617 --> 00:55:31.411
- Eden's right. though.

1118
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:33.663
I've been wondering the same thing.

1119
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:34.831
- I wouldn't think twice about it

1120
00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:37.792
if everyone else here wasn't so weird.

1121
00:55:37.792 --> 00:55:39.169
- [Matthew] Yeah.

1122
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.128
I think this whole town is getting to us.

1123
00:55:40.128 --> 00:55:41.880
- Which is exactly why we're eating

1124
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.340
and getting back on the road.

1125
00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:45.967
Goodbye. Marfa!

1126
00:55:45.967 --> 00:55:47.344
(whistles) Out of here.

1127
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:51.681
- Have any of y'all thought about

1128
00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:52.807
having a bucket list?

1129
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:55.602
You know. things you wanna
accomplish before you die?

1130
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:57.354
- [Erik] Bucket list?

1131
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.981
Come on. that's for folks dodging coffins.

1132
00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:01.316
I haven't even started my life yet.

1133
00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:02.734
I'm barely 20 years old.

1134
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:05.987
- Well seeing how bad you look

1135
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.990
and that curse the gypsy put on you.

1136
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:12.786
I'd say you start thinking
bucket list pretty soon. buddy.

1137
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.663
- [Eden] You know. I told
him the exact same thing.

1138
00:56:15.663 --> 00:56:17.040
- [Allie] How do you mean?

1139
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.416
- Just that the gypsy either cursed him

1140
00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:19.292
or cast a spell on him.

1141
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:20.877
- Hey. come on now.

1142
00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:23.922
- Or we could just drop all that and eat.

1143
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:26.925
- Sorry for bringing something up

1144
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:28.676
most folks would get excited about.

1145
00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:32.639
- So you bring up what we
wanna do before we die?

1146
00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:33.932
Yeah. No. thank you.

1147
00:56:35.683 --> 00:56:38.520
- [Allie] Y'all need to
chill out a whole lot.

1148
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.231
(sirens wailing)

1149
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.444
- [Eden] Where do you think they're going?

1150
00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:49.572
- [Erik] Let's go see what's going on.

1151
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.879
- They seem to like it here.

1152
00:57:06.464 --> 00:57:07.590
(eerie music)

1153
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.800
- [Vincent] You think so?

1154
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.843
- Yeah. I do.

1155
00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:12.178
I think they're gonna stay.

1156
00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:14.556
How about you?

1157
00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.434
You still planning on leaving?

1158
00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:19.602
- What do you think?

1159
00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:22.397
- I think that you're confused.

1160
00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:25.817
I think you don't know
where you should be.

1161
00:57:29.487 --> 00:57:30.655
Look out there. Vincent.

1162
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:32.866
What do you see?

1163
00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:35.910
Where are you gonna go?

1164
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:37.954
What are you gonna do when you get there?

1165
00:57:38.872 --> 00:57:40.457
When are you gonna understand

1166
00:57:41.749 --> 00:57:43.126
that you belong here?

1167
00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.005
- No. I don't.

1168
00:57:48.339 --> 00:57:49.632
- Come on. Vincent.

1169
00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:53.970
Vincent. why don't you stick around. huh?

1170
00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.054
I need you. Vincent.

1171
00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:57.974
We gotta keep everybody in line. man.

1172
00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.350
I need you.

1173
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:00.143
Vincent!

1174
00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:03.438
- [Vincent] It's getting late now.

1175
00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.367
Choosing the right moment.

1176
00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:21.039
That. that's what it comes down to.

1177
00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:23.625
(wind howling)

1178
00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:26.336
- I told you all someone
needed help. didn't I?

1179
00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:27.712
- Oh my God.

1180
00:58:27.712 --> 00:58:28.963
- I wonder what happened.

1181
00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:31.341
I only see one car.

1182
00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:32.175
- Yeah.

1183
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.468
It looks like it just rolled over.

1184
00:58:34.385 --> 00:58:38.181
Maybe the driver fell asleep or something.

1185
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.682
- Oh. goodness.

1186
00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:41.684
Any idea what happened?

1187
00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.894
- No.

1188
00:58:42.894 --> 00:58:45.480
(thunder crashing)

1189
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.816
(electricity crackling)

1190
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:53.321
- Erik. are you okay?
- Erik!

1191
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:54.656
(tires screeching)
(girls screaming)

1192
00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:59.619
(glass shattering)
(Erik breathing heavily)

1193
00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:06.876
- Deja vu.

1194
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:15.468
- [Allie] Let me see. Erik.

1195
00:59:15.468 --> 00:59:16.302
- What?

1196
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:28.022
(sign squeaking)

1197
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.610
- I've been here before.

1198
00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.072
- Erik.

1199
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.616
That's your car.

1200
00:59:40.118 --> 00:59:41.995
That's the car that we were riding in.

1201
00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:55.633
(sirens wailing)

1202
00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.804
- [Eden] Where do you think they're going?

1203
00:59:59.804 --> 01:00:02.974
- [Erik] Let's go see what's going on.

1204
01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:14.027
(tires screeching)

1205
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.031
(car crashing)

1206
01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.963
(sirens wailing)

1207
01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:47.560
- [Paramedic] We've got people in here.

1208
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.020
I have no vitals.

1209
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:49.979
- I think I get it.

1210
01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.107
- Get what. Erik?

1211
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:55.652
- [Mysterious Voice] Erik.

1212
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.404
- [Norman] That is your car. Erik.

1213
01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.908
- You're the man from the bar.

1214
01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.494
(jaunty music)

1215
01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:10.750
- Oh. your perceptive
capabilities are just astounding.

1216
01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:18.091
(Norman humming "Entry of the Gladiators")

1217
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:18.925
You. sir.

1218
01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:23.179
You've been here already.

1219
01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.390
And you. Erik.

1220
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.351
you've definitely been here before.

1221
01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:33.398
(Norman humming "Entry of the Gladiators")

1222
01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:36.442
(heartbeat pounding)

1223
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.372
- [Matthew] Erik.

1224
01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.207
- [Allie] Let me see. Erik.

1225
01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.668
(tires screeching)

1226
01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:55.461
(somber music)

1227
01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:56.921
- [Waitress] He's right.

1228
01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:58.423
You all have been here before.

1229
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.968
- I need you guys to back up.

1230
01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.928
I want you guys to back up.

1231
01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:05.555
Come on. guys. You need to back up.

1232
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:10.184
- [Eden] What? No. no.

1233
01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:11.811
(crying) No.

1234
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.980
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

1235
01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.023
It's okay.

1236
01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:17.567
Hey. hey.

1237
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.818
Hey. it's okay.

1238
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.279
It's okay.

1239
01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:23.448
Allie.

1240
01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:28.453
Allie. what are you looking at?

1241
01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:31.289
(machine buzzing)

1242
01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:38.921
- The ticket.

1243
01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:41.966
(thunder rumbling)

1244
01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.050
I don't know.

1245
01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:47.513
I forgot to read it.

1246
01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:51.267
- What does it say?

1247
01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.062
- [Erik] At this point.

1248
01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.356
it can't get any worse.

1249
01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.109
- Allie. just tell us.

1250
01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:04.781
- Remember what I tried telling you all

1251
01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.908
that night at the observatory?

1252
01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:13.372
- Why is a picture of them in here?

1253
01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:14.207
What?

1254
01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.795
We never understood a
single word you said!

1255
01:03:23.674 --> 01:03:24.509
Oh my God.

1256
01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:28.429
It's you.

1257
01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:30.848
You're Wilmer.

1258
01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.269
- Every beginning has an end.

1259
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:40.191
Life. lives. your lives. our lives.

1260
01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:43.444
Dead or alive.

1261
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.033
- What do you mean your lives?

1262
01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:51.369
- What Wilmer is trying to say

1263
01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:53.996
is that we've been here with you before.

1264
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.749
- [Eden] What?

1265
01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:57.917
- Tell 'em.

1266
01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.502
Be more specific.

1267
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:07.093
- Wilmer. Norman from
the diner. and myself.

1268
01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.095
we've been here.

1269
01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.057
- [Vincent] The waitress. Donna.

1270
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.309
That smile.

1271
01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.063
that very hospitality seen
in diners and truck stops

1272
01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:20.147
across the country.

1273
01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:23.901
The mayor knew she had loyalty

1274
01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:26.821
and didn't have the courage to move on.

1275
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:29.073
Donna died in the '50s.

1276
01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:33.160
- What the lady here. Miss Monroe.

1277
01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.328
is trying to say.

1278
01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:36.831
we pretty much stood like you

1279
01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:40.585
and we stared into the
abyss of our own bodies.

1280
01:04:42.086 --> 01:04:45.923
- [Vincent] The man at the
bar. the eccentric Norman.

1281
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.051
a child of the '70s.

1282
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.053
always saw things his way

1283
01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:54.390
uniquely without consequence.

1284
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.267
Maybe that's why Marfa

1285
01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.728
was all too comfortable for him.

1286
01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.897
- Just like you all are now.

1287
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:04.942
- [Vincent] Wilmer.

1288
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.361
The man in the dark.

1289
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.907
The wise one of the bunch.

1290
01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.912
His wisdom is what held him back.

1291
01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:19.415
Always too afraid to try and move on.

1292
01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:22.877
Although he's been
debating that with himself

1293
01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.172
ever since his death back in the '60s.

1294
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:29.383
- When?

1295
01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:31.969
When did this happen?

1296
01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:34.430
- For us?

1297
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.390
A very long time ago.

1298
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:41.020
- [Norman] We all passed on
in our own time. individually.

1299
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.854
- No!

1300
01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:45.524
I mean the car wreck.

1301
01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:47.193
We need to get home.

1302
01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:50.029
- Good luck to you. too.

1303
01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.491
I hope that home is where you end up.

1304
01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:58.746
- Not sure what that means.

1305
01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.707
That's exactly where we're headed.

1306
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.628
(gentle music)

1307
01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:11.842
(coin clattering)

1308
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.411
- [Vincent] Death stared him in the face.

1309
01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.208
His own subconscious even grabbed him.

1310
01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:48.254
- [Mysterious Voice] Erik.

1311
01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.131
It's because of you.

1312
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.632
Go to the lights.

1313
01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:55.678
- [Vincent] The gypsy never
stopped whispering in his ear.

1314
01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.263
But he missed all the clues.

1315
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.847
- Hey Erik.

1316
01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:41.682
you still good to drive. man?

1317
01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:43.184
- Heck yeah. dude.

1318
01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:45.227
- All right.

1319
01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:48.981
Bye. dinosaur.

1320
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.943
- Erik has something he'd like to confess.

1321
01:07:52.943 --> 01:07:54.904
- [Matthew] She's here too. Why not?

1322
01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:55.988
Why not?

1323
01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:58.949
- [Vincent] The gypsy. Heather.

1324
01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:00.785
She died in the 1980s.

1325
01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:04.288
Not much of a fortune teller.

1326
01:08:04.288 --> 01:08:06.999
but then again. which of us is?

1327
01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.753
- So what do you need to tell us?

1328
01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:14.924
- Tell them what you did
back at the gas station.

1329
01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.634
How you all got here.

1330
01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:17.926
They have a right to know.

1331
01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.139
- [Matthew] Erik. just say it.

1332
01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:29.313
- I'd been drinking.

1333
01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.611
I put alcohol in my
drink at the gas station.

1334
01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:39.490
I wasn't in the right
frame of mind to drive.

1335
01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:40.324
I'm sorry.

1336
01:08:40.324 --> 01:08:42.827
(tense music)

1337
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.414
- You killed us!

1338
01:08:47.414 --> 01:08:48.249
Huh?

1339
01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:50.792
And I killed us too.

1340
01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:51.627
- Why didn't you just let me drive?

1341
01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.545
- No. stop!

1342
01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.380
What's done is done.

1343
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.675
(Eden screams)

1344
01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:00.261
(Eden sobbing)

1345
01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:06.142
- [Erik] I'm sorry doesn't
even begin to cut it.

1346
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.478
- It's what you all do now that counts.

1347
01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.771
Move on.

1348
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:14.191
- Trust in us!

1349
01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:15.651
Testify!

1350
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.653
- [Donna] Do not let this keep you here.

1351
01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.491
- Keep us from what? Huh?

1352
01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.412
The car wreck concludes everything.

1353
01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:29.290
- [Donna] No. you're not
listening. my darling.

1354
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.541
You need to move on just
like Wilmer told you.

1355
01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:32.376
- We never had the courage

1356
01:09:32.376 --> 01:09:33.919
which is why we are still here.

1357
01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:38.048
- I've been a waitress

1358
01:09:38.048 --> 01:09:39.550
a lot longer than you may think.

1359
01:09:41.218 --> 01:09:44.180
- We're stuck here. here in this town.

1360
01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:50.144
- [Matthew] You're stuck in Marfa.

1361
01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:54.398
- [Norman] Yeah. in Marfa.

1362
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.821
- Well. yes and no.

1363
01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:01.655
You see. Marfa is where the living

1364
01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:03.365
and the dead cross roads.

1365
01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:05.492
We don't interact with each other.

1366
01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.827
but we share the same space together.

1367
01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:10.456
- Yeah?

1368
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.333
That sounds like purgatory.

1369
01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.002
- Right you are!

1370
01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:17.963
This is what we've been
trying to share with you.

1371
01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:22.425
- I wanted to.

1372
01:10:22.425 --> 01:10:24.553
Miss Monroe told me not to.

1373
01:10:25.429 --> 01:10:27.764
I've just been trying
to save you some moves.

1374
01:10:27.764 --> 01:10:29.266
cut to the chase.

1375
01:10:30.934 --> 01:10:32.978
- You didn't need to tell them.

1376
01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:34.813
They need to figure it out on their own.

1377
01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:42.362
- I just wanted them
to get out of this town

1378
01:10:42.362 --> 01:10:46.075
and it could be so different for them.

1379
01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.956
- You know as well as we all do.

1380
01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:53.958
what's done is done.

1381
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:56.752
- Not necessarily.

1382
01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.047
If they will listen to us right now.

1383
01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:03.384
things could be different.

1384
01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.474
- [Wilmer] Like I told you all

1385
01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:13.559
that night at the observatory.

1386
01:11:13.559 --> 01:11:16.272
those lights were a sign

1387
01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.273
to protect those who would listen.

1388
01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:24.280
that an ending is just
simply a new beginning.

1389
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.740
- What does that even mean. man? Come on.

1390
01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.657
- A new beginning.

1391
01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.369
A new beginning?

1392
01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.620
We're dead!

1393
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.414
- To your new life.

1394
01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:34.665
This is where you're at

1395
01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:37.918
right here. right now.

1396
01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:40.087
- Do not dwell on this.

1397
01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.464
Do not put roots down in Marfa.

1398
01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:45.675
Y'all need to move on.

1399
01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:47.969
- What if...

1400
01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.516
What if we never came to Marfa?

1401
01:11:56.645 --> 01:12:01.650
Oh my god.

1402
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.489
- Look. I know you can't stay.

1403
01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.491
I know you have to go

1404
01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:10.951
and I know they have to go.

1405
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.788
- [Vincent] Henry. come with me.

1406
01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:19.335
- I'm too afraid of my own judgment.

1407
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.047
- They have free will. so do you.

1408
01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:25.174
They need to leave and
I'm leaving with them.

1409
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:27.425
- [Henry] I can't.

1410
01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:31.638
- Why not. Henry?

1411
01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:34.600
The mayor.

1412
01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.478
the official gatekeeper of Marfa.

1413
01:12:39.938 --> 01:12:41.857
I'm not really sure when he passed.

1414
01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:43.942
He's always been here

1415
01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.653
holding people down.

1416
01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:49.073
keeping them from moving on.

1417
01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.284
- [Henry] Walk to the light.

1418
01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.371
(soft tense music)

1419
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.529
- For once in my life

1420
01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.990
I actually saw this one coming.

1421
01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:38.330
I hitchhiked my way across the country

1422
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:39.748
until I ended up right here.

1423
01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:41.708
Marfa.

1424
01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:45.087
Quiet. peaceful.

1425
01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.550
I've been restless ever since
that day claimed my life.

1426
01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:53.804
You're not the only one

1427
01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:55.222
who bought a fortune telling ticket

1428
01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.391
at that gas station. Allie.

1429
01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:00.686
- You got one too?

1430
01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:03.897
Did you read it?

1431
01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:05.482
- Yes.

1432
01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:06.316
I read mine.

1433
01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:09.318
But you never read yours.

1434
01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:13.073
Here's what I know.

1435
01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:14.992
They always taught us

1436
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.410
never pick up hitchhikers.

1437
01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:19.496
but they never told us about the dangers

1438

of getting in cars with strangers.

1439
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.624
- Wait. what?

1440
01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.377
You knew this was gonna happen?

1441
01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:30.466
You knew if you'd get in
the car with us. you'd die?

1442
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.967
- He hoped it wouldn't come to this.

1443
01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.177
- [Vincent] That's right.

1444
01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:36.054
- He hoped y'all would read the ticket.

1445

- Well since you've been here.

1446
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:38.932
you've been hanging around us quite a bit.

1447
01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:43.687
- I was hoping to have someone

1448
01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:45.564
to face the fear of the unknown with.

1449
01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:50.068
- That's certainly looking
at the glass half full.

especially at a time like this.

1451
01:14:56.407 --> 01:14:57.659

1453
01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:01.746

1454
01:15:01.746 --> 01:15:03.499

I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1456
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.588
