00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:40.308
Okay. bro.

177
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.183
Now pick up your bike and relax.

178
00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:47.225
That asshole always
wants what's yours!

179
00:12:49.183 --> 00:12:52.183
Never mind. we shut him up good.

180
00:12:56.933 --> 00:12:58.808
That's enough. man!
Calm down now.

181
00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:27.225
Come on. bro!

182
00:13:32.266 --> 00:13:34.016
Hook that bike on here!

183
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.683
Come on. driver!

184
00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.516
Step on it . bro!

185
00:14:49.225 --> 00:14:50.183
Hey. Sere!

186
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:53.808
Check out this picture. bro.

187
00:15:01.558 --> 00:15:04.058
-Winny. take our picture!
-Yeah!

188
00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:08.350
Souvenir!

189
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.308
Let's do it!

190
00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:18.475
-Push it hard. Rá!
-Take the lead. Rá! Come on!

191
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:22.100
That's it. bro!
Downhill all the way!

192
00:15:25.475 --> 00:15:27.100
Good luck!

193
00:16:41.683 --> 00:16:43.641
End of the line. bro!

194
00:16:49.016 --> 00:16:50.891
That's it. bro!

195
00:16:51.016 --> 00:16:53.766
-Tell me!
-How'd it go?

196
00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.933
My bro.

197
00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:58.933
That's it.

198
00:17:32.808 --> 00:17:35.975
Sir. gimme two bags of chips
and a soda. please.

199
00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:29.225
Sir…

200
00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:30.600
Friend…

201
00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:34.141
Can I have two bags of chips
and a soda. please?

202
00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:33.641
What's up. Rá?

203
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.183
Hold this. kid.

204
00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.100
Make a wish…

205
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.516
-Don't be stupid!
-What do you want. huh?

206
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.141
I wanna get to my land

207
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.016
with all of you.

208
00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:52.725
Dude!

209
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:55.016
Look at that. dude!

210
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.891
We gotta have faith. bro!

211
00:19:56.975 --> 00:19:59.183
We're gonna get there!

212
00:19:59.308 --> 00:20:00.933
Come on. Sere. your turn!

213
00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:03.641
What are you talking about?
None of those wishes will come true.

214
00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:05.016
Bro!

215
00:20:05.183 --> 00:20:07.016
-What's your wish. bro?
-Here it is!

216
00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.975
-Shit!
-I hit it!

217
00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:12.225
Asshole!

218
00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:14.641
Come on. Sere. let's do it!

219
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.433
Go on. Sere!

220
00:20:17.058 --> 00:20:18.558
Oh. shit!

221
00:20:18.641 --> 00:20:20.641
Good one. Sere! Come on!

222
00:20:21.016 --> 00:20:22.850
We're going to heaven!

223
00:20:23.891 --> 00:20:25.100
Now you. Winny!

224
00:20:28.058 --> 00:20:31.016
-That's it. Winny! Good shot!
-Let's do this!

225
00:20:31.183 --> 00:20:33.350
-Yeah!
-Your turn. Nano! Give me!

226
00:20:33.433 --> 00:20:35.433
-Go on. Nano!
-My turn!

227
00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:37.058
Nano. Nano! Go on!

228
00:20:40.308 --> 00:20:41.683
Good one!

229
00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:21.808
I'm speechless. man.

230
00:21:22.058 --> 00:21:24.808
All those cows and land
with no owners.

231
00:21:24.975 --> 00:21:26.766
no houses… Speechless.

232
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.725
Shit. kid. all of that
belongs to somebody.

233
00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:31.350
How could somebody own it?

234
00:21:31.516 --> 00:21:33.933
As far as the eye can see.
it's all owned by somebody.

235
00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:35.600
You see any houses?
Any people taking care of it?

236
00:21:35.683 --> 00:21:38.100
Everything in this world
has an owner. Everything.

237
00:21:38.516 --> 00:21:42.183
So what's that thing down there?
Is that a mule?

238
00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:43.683
A mule? Are you stupid?

239
00:21:43.808 --> 00:21:45.391
Can't you tell it's a cow?

240
00:21:45.516 --> 00:21:47.766
-Are you high or what?
-You're crazy. bro!

241
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.641
You're crazy too. kid!

242
00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:51.683
It looks like a horse to me.

243
00:21:51.808 --> 00:21:53.308
And you're a bum!

244
00:21:53.433 --> 00:21:55.850
Lay off that bag. Nano!

245
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:57.683
Yeah. get rid of that glue!

246
00:21:57.766 --> 00:22:00.891
Those cows have it
a lot easier than us.

247
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.725
I was thinking the same thing.

248
00:22:03.683 --> 00:22:06.183
But that's the life we were given!

249
00:22:06.308 --> 00:22:09.433
So suck it up!
You know how it is. bro.

250
00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:12.558
-Okay. let's go see life.
-But you know what?

251
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:15.725
-Hey. Nano!
-Careful! Are you nuts?

252
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.183
Let's go!

253
00:22:18.766 --> 00:22:20.058
Bro!

254
00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:22.183
-Speechless. man!
-Bro!

255
00:22:22.516 --> 00:22:23.891
For real!

256
00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:26.225
Nano. let's go!

257
00:22:27.016 --> 00:22:27.850
Speechless!

258
00:22:27.933 --> 00:22:29.808
-Culebro. let's go!
-Speechless!

259
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:31.100
Good one!

260
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:41.433
Watch it. jerk!

261
00:22:41.933 --> 00:22:43.100
Feeling happy. are you?

262
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.391
Watch out. asshole!

263
00:22:45.516 --> 00:22:46.600
Shit!

264
00:22:46.683 --> 00:22:48.850
-Swing it hard!
-Shit!

265
00:22:58.558 --> 00:23:01.600
-Oh. shit!
-They're leaving!

266
00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:15.766
Touch it!

267
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.850
Let's see…

268
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.475
-Put a finger on it!
-Grab it!

269
00:23:25.683 --> 00:23:27.975
Grab it hard!
Harder!

270
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.766
You always think
you're better at everything!

271
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.766
Harder! Go on!

272
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.100
This one is!

273
00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:38.891
-Shit!
-Shit!

274
00:23:39.891 --> 00:23:41.475
Speechless…

275
00:23:41.766 --> 00:23:42.808
Speechless. bro.

276
00:23:42.891 --> 00:23:44.183
Whoever holds it longest
is the hardest.

277
00:23:44.266 --> 00:23:45.641
Shit!

278
00:23:45.725 --> 00:23:47.266
Come here. it's not that bad!

279
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.516
Gimme your hand!

280
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.183
-Hold it! Hold it tight. bro!
-Now I really feel it!

281
00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:56.016
Don't let go!

282
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.641
Fucking great!

283
00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.808
Bring it in closer. Sere.

284
00:24:05.058 --> 00:24:06.725
Shit! Sere…

285
00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:10.933
Leave it there. you'll see.

286
00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:13.266
-Trust me. Sere.
-That's it.

287
00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:19.933
What does it feel like?

288
00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:21.350
A cramp.

289
00:24:21.516 --> 00:24:23.266
A cramp? That's great!

290
00:24:23.766 --> 00:24:26.391
It doesn't feel the same
as the other hand. but I feel it.

291
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.391
But you feel it.

292
00:24:28.975 --> 00:24:30.850
It moves on its own.

293
00:25:13.266 --> 00:25:15.308
Watch you don't fall.

294
00:26:10.725 --> 00:26:11.933
Hello. boys!

295
00:26:12.475 --> 00:26:13.725
Welcome!

296
00:26:14.266 --> 00:26:15.683
How are you?

297
00:26:16.433 --> 00:26:18.183
Are you hungry?

298
00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:20.891
Thirsty?
Would you like to have something?

299
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.975
God bless you. ma'am!

300
00:26:35.558 --> 00:26:36.516
Thank you.

301
00:26:37.266 --> 00:26:38.600
Good. thanks.

302
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:09.183
FREEDOM AND ORDER

303
00:29:09.933 --> 00:29:13.600
Let's go inside ladies. these boys
turned out really shy!

304
00:29:39.808 --> 00:29:41.100
-Dude!
-Soap!

305
00:29:46.808 --> 00:29:48.141
Get the fuck away!

306
00:29:48.891 --> 00:29:50.141
Culebro. don't!

307
00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:53.766
You jerks!

308
00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.558
Now you. negro!

309
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.183
His hair's like a sponge!

310
00:30:13.558 --> 00:30:15.225
Chicken soup. negro!

311
00:30:15.391 --> 00:30:16.391
Chicken soup!

312
00:30:18.141 --> 00:30:20.433
Catch that chicken soup!

313
00:30:28.683 --> 00:30:29.891
Shit. you guys…

314
00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:33.100
She likes it. shit!

315
00:30:33.183 --> 00:30:35.975
Take it easy with the chicken!

316
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:38.641
See how she's enjoying it?

317
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.433
We should let her go.
she's getting all…

318
00:30:50.641 --> 00:30:52.016
Oh. God bless you. ma'am.

319
00:30:54.975 --> 00:30:57.266
Take it easy. boys.
there's plenty for everyone.

320
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.558
-My God.
-You guys…

321
00:30:58.641 --> 00:31:01.308
Eat up now.
it's made with love.

322
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:02.308
Would you like some more?

323
00:31:03.183 --> 00:31:04.850
God bless you. ma'am.

324
00:31:05.016 --> 00:31:06.433
God bless!

325
00:31:10.975 --> 00:31:12.600
Thank you God for this food.

326
00:31:12.683 --> 00:31:14.183
-God bless this food.
-Amen.

327
00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:15.641
-Amen.
-Amen. bro.

328
00:31:15.808 --> 00:31:16.850
Amen. bro.

329
00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:18.350
You know it.

330
00:31:22.225 --> 00:31:23.683
Hey. you guys…

331
00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:26.058
She gives a good blowjob.
I gotta say.

332
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:26.933
No…

333
00:31:27.683 --> 00:31:29.350
You're such a chatterbox.

334
00:31:29.433 --> 00:31:31.475
I won't say another word.

335
00:31:31.558 --> 00:31:33.725
Next time just shut up. bro.

336
00:32:24.266 --> 00:32:26.475
Honey. breakfast is ready.

337
00:32:34.058 --> 00:32:36.725
-Scoot over. Rá.
-Hey. kid. How are you?

338
00:32:37.516 --> 00:32:38.516
Eat up.

339
00:32:39.475 --> 00:32:41.266
And you. son? How old are you?

340
00:32:41.808 --> 00:32:42.975
Nineteen.

341
00:32:43.183 --> 00:32:45.141
And very well raised.

342
00:32:46.766 --> 00:32:48.100
Broad-chested.

343
00:32:50.266 --> 00:32:53.058
And you. where are you from?

344
00:32:53.141 --> 00:32:54.558
From Apartadó.

345
00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:55.641
Yeah…

346
00:32:58.016 --> 00:32:59.933
What do you have there?

347
00:33:03.016 --> 00:33:05.391
-Show her.
-Easy. easy!

348
00:33:06.516 --> 00:33:09.725
Gloria. bring me the Isodine

349
00:33:09.808 --> 00:33:11.808
and some cotton and Band-aids!

350
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.808
How did you do this?

351
00:33:14.266 --> 00:33:15.725
Some asshole knifed me.

352
00:33:16.766 --> 00:33:18.516
I can see you're trouble. honey.

353
00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:20.100
You like to fight!

354
00:33:20.183 --> 00:33:22.350
-A real firecracker.
-Is he now?

355
00:33:23.766 --> 00:33:25.016
A little spark!

356
00:33:25.433 --> 00:33:26.766
Am I right?

357
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.433
Hold this and I'll
put some gauze on it.

358
00:33:29.516 --> 00:33:30.808
I'll hold it. kid.

359
00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.808
It's really big…

360
00:33:32.891 --> 00:33:35.475
-Yes. he should have stitches.
-It's nothing!

361
00:33:35.558 --> 00:33:39.308
Behave yourself son.
so they'll kill you last.

362
00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:40.558
Okay…

363
00:33:42.391 --> 00:33:43.725
Now leave it alone.

364
00:33:44.891 --> 00:33:47.058
Bro. why don't we just stay here?

365
00:33:47.308 --> 00:33:48.641
What do you mean?

366
00:33:49.225 --> 00:33:52.058
Haven't you seen?
These old ladies are real nice.

367
00:33:52.141 --> 00:33:54.933
-There's beds. blankets. a roof…
-No…

368
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:58.141
So where are you headed. boys?

369
00:33:58.225 --> 00:33:59.225
To Nechí. ma'am.

370
00:33:59.308 --> 00:34:00.558
What are you going to do there?

371
00:34:00.641 --> 00:34:02.808
Reclaim some land. ma'am.

372
00:34:02.891 --> 00:34:05.725
-Who left you land?
-My grandma. praise God.

373
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:08.141
How will you get the land back?

374
00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:09.725
The government is giving it back.

375
00:34:09.808 --> 00:34:11.225
-Really?
-Yes. ma'am.

376
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.808
The Land Restitution program?

377
00:34:13.891 --> 00:34:15.141
Yes. ma'am. praise God.

378
00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:18.683
Well. don't tell anyone
where you're going or why.

379
00:34:18.808 --> 00:34:21.600
-Why not?
-Things are dangerous there now.

380
00:34:22.016 --> 00:34:23.891
You're better off
not saying a word.

381
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.850
-You think so. ma'am?
-Yes.

382
00:34:27.808 --> 00:34:29.100
Be very careful.

383
00:34:35.391 --> 00:34:37.350
What's the matter with you. negro?

384
00:34:37.683 --> 00:34:40.850
Show some respect. old man!

385
00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:42.850
We're not doing you any harm. man!

386
00:34:44.058 --> 00:34:46.600
Show some respect for
the kid. old man!

387
00:34:46.683 --> 00:34:50.350
That's enough. boys.
no fighting now.

388
00:34:50.516 --> 00:34:52.308
Is he crazy or just drunk?

389
00:34:52.475 --> 00:34:56.225
Adriana. take that customer
out of here. he's trouble.

390
00:34:56.641 --> 00:34:59.225
I hope he tries something
with her. we'll show him.

391
00:35:00.308 --> 00:35:01.808
Calm down.

392
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:03.933
Never mind. Nano.
the guy forgot to take his pills.

393
00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:05.475
The old guy's fried.

394
00:35:20.516 --> 00:35:23.308
<i>There's a pond on the plains.</i>

395
00:35:23.558 --> 00:35:26.766
<i>where clear water bubbles up.</i>

396
00:35:27.016 --> 00:35:30.266
<i>Beautiful. pure. and cool.</i>

397
00:35:30.683 --> 00:35:33.058
<i>below an araguaney tree.</i>

398
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.225
<i>There's a pond on the plains.</i>

399
00:35:36.933 --> 00:35:39.891
<i>where clear water bubbles up.</i>

400
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:43.308
<i>Beautiful. pure. and cool.</i>

401
00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:46.516
<i>below an araguaney tree.</i>

402
00:35:46.933 --> 00:35:49.808
<i>That's why in my cabin</i>

403
00:35:49.975 --> 00:35:53.016
<i>everything is happy and sweet.</i>

404
00:35:53.141 --> 00:35:56.308
<i>Your tenderness covers me.</i>

405
00:35:56.433 --> 00:35:59.600
<i>your grace and your virtue!</i>

406
00:36:00.058 --> 00:36:02.600
<i>Together. you and my spring</i>

407
00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:06.016
<i>adorn my plains.</i>

408
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.266
<i>Together. you and my spring</i>

409
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.141
<i>adorn these plains.</i>

410
00:38:10.308 --> 00:38:11.891
What a place!

411
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.350
Pills are always a winner. bro!

412
00:38:43.641 --> 00:38:45.225
Oh. okay…

413
00:39:25.308 --> 00:39:27.350
<i>In my own perfect world.</i>

414
00:39:27.808 --> 00:39:30.641
<i>if you don't want to exist.</i>
<i>you don't have to.</i>

415
00:39:41.183 --> 00:39:43.391
<i>I want to own a world.</i>

416
00:39:48.975 --> 00:39:50.725
<i>I don't wanna fall asleep.</i>

417
00:39:51.725 --> 00:39:53.308
<i>I don't wanna get old.</i>

418
00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:59.308
<i>I'd like to be invisible.</i>
<i>like a shadow.</i>

419
00:40:04.058 --> 00:40:05.975
<i>Freedom. with the eternal ones…</i>

420
00:40:06.266 --> 00:40:07.850
<i>always present.</i>

421
00:41:49.433 --> 00:41:52.058
Get in you assholes! Get in. now!

422
00:41:55.266 --> 00:41:58.016
We haven't done anything!
We were just chilling!

423
00:42:49.516 --> 00:42:50.808
Good evening. Father.

424
00:42:50.975 --> 00:42:52.183
Good evening. don Santiago.

425
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:54.850
God bless you. boys.

426
00:42:54.933 --> 00:42:55.933
Amen. Father.

427
00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:57.600
-Amen.
-Amen. Father.

428
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:17.266
Five of them…

429
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:27.683
Shut up. assholes!

430
00:44:27.808 --> 00:44:29.808
Shut the fuck up!

431
00:44:31.933 --> 00:44:32.808
Sere!

432
00:44:33.141 --> 00:44:35.141
Shut it or we'll fucking kill you!

433
00:44:39.058 --> 00:44:40.058
Don't move!

434
00:44:40.308 --> 00:44:42.225
Stay right there!

435
00:44:42.475 --> 00:44:43.808
Let him go!

436
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:45.016
Let go of him.
he's coming with us!

437
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:46.516
Let me go!

438
00:46:06.475 --> 00:46:08.100
This is all your fault!

439
00:46:08.308 --> 00:46:10.391
What do you mean it's my fault?

440
00:46:11.016 --> 00:46:12.225
What the fuck?

441
00:46:13.058 --> 00:46:14.600
You got a problem. asshole?

442
00:46:15.016 --> 00:46:16.891
-Rá. bro. listen!
-Motherfucker!

443
00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:19.058
We were fine where we were!

444
00:46:19.975 --> 00:46:20.975
Rá!

445
00:46:21.975 --> 00:46:22.933
Motherfucker!

446
00:46:23.016 --> 00:46:24.266
The papers. bro!

447
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:25.808
So why did you follow us?

448
00:46:25.933 --> 00:46:27.391
We were fine
back where we were!

449
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.891
Get lost. asshole!

450
00:46:29.391 --> 00:46:31.475
What happened to Nano.
should have happened to you!

451
00:46:31.558 --> 00:46:32.850
Rá! I lost the papers!

452
00:46:33.225 --> 00:46:35.058
I dropped the title!

453
00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:36.725
I dropped them!

454
00:46:36.808 --> 00:46:38.641
-You've got them!
-No. I don't!

455
00:46:40.183 --> 00:46:41.475
Do you have them?

456
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.058
-That asshole has them!
-You have them. motherfucker!

457
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:44.433
-I don't have shit!
-Give them to me!

458
00:46:44.516 --> 00:46:45.933
-I don't have shit!
-I said give them to me!

459
00:46:46.058 --> 00:46:47.391
Motherfucker!

460
00:46:50.016 --> 00:46:52.183
I told you.
I don't have them!

461
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.308
-Fuck!
-Calm down. man!

462
00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:57.933
Fuck! The papers!

463
00:46:58.225 --> 00:46:59.975
Rá. bro. don't!

464
00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.100
Go. go. go!

465
00:50:06.183 --> 00:50:07.350
Hey. Rá!

466
00:50:07.433 --> 00:50:10.141
Fucking Culebro took off
with our food!

467
00:50:10.725 --> 00:50:12.558
No words for that asshole.

468
00:51:41.058 --> 00:51:42.391
Come on in.

469
00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:54.516
Hand me the cups.

470
00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:33.558
Where are you headed?

471
00:55:35.016 --> 00:55:36.308
We're going to Nechí.

472
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:38.766
To reclaim a piece of land

473
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.350
the paramilitaries stole from
my grandma a long time ago.

474
00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:51.433
You're taking care of those kids
as if they were your own?

475
00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:54.475
Sure.

476
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.016
They're my family.

477
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.975
They've got nobody.
Me neither.

478
00:56:02.975 --> 00:56:04.516
We're all alone.

479
00:56:05.933 --> 00:56:08.891
We keep each other company and…

480
00:56:09.808 --> 00:56:13.683
I just want to take them
some place where we'll be okay.

481
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.808
Where we'll have what we need.

482
00:56:16.475 --> 00:56:18.891
Where nobody beats us up.
or humiliates

483
00:56:19.058 --> 00:56:20.516
or looks down on us.

484
00:56:21.933 --> 00:56:24.016
Where we can all
do whatever we want.

485
00:56:24.891 --> 00:56:26.933
And fight for what we believe in.

486
00:56:28.891 --> 00:56:30.600
That's all I want.

487
00:56:35.516 --> 00:56:37.891
You really think the government
will give you that land back?

488
00:56:38.225 --> 00:56:39.558
Yes. I do.

489
00:56:40.058 --> 00:56:41.475
I have faith they will.

490
00:56:47.766 --> 00:56:51.600
So why do the men in charge
around here leave you alone?

491
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:55.808
They think I'm crazy.

492
00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:19.475
These lands have
different plans for everyone. son.

493
00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:33.516
Have some. bro.

494
01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.100
<i>They say water is</i>
<i>the blood of this world.</i>

495
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.641
<i>It's raining now.</i>

496
01:00:27.475 --> 01:00:30.683
<i>and with its tears.</i>
<i>it bathes the land.</i>

497
01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:33.766
<i>And with my blood.</i>
<i>I bathe the land.</i>

498
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:48.016
<i>The river that has formed</i>
<i>floods this valley.</i>

499
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.808
<i>It carries away the memory</i>
<i>of my ancestors…</i>

500
01:00:55.058 --> 01:00:56.308
<i>Yours…</i>

501
01:00:57.266 --> 01:00:59.141
<i>Theirs…</i>

502
01:01:00.683 --> 01:01:02.100
<i>Ours.</i>

503
01:01:04.266 --> 01:01:06.266
<i>The eager ocean awaits.</i>

504
01:01:07.058 --> 01:01:09.975
<i>The eager ocean awaits me.</i>

505
01:01:20.516 --> 01:01:22.850
<i>There is no harbor anymore.</i>

506
01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:27.141
Hey!

507
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:07.058
You're lucky the old man let you stay.
you son of a bitch!

508
01:04:09.725 --> 01:04:11.850
You'll only ever be
a shitty little leech!

509
01:05:04.183 --> 01:05:06.391
All these lands
are full of gold. boys.

510
01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:14.141
That river over there
will take you where you're going.

511
01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:18.475
It's a wild river.
so be very careful.

512
01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:30.183
Stay alive. kids.

513
01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:21.975
Where the hell are we. Rá?

514
01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.141
Always acting like
he knows everything!

515
01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:26.808
And he has no idea!

516
01:09:16.308 --> 01:09:18.016
You wanna get killed. kid?

517
01:09:18.183 --> 01:09:20.100
Gimme the papers. motherfucker! Rá!

518
01:09:21.808 --> 01:09:23.350
Motherfucker!

519
01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:26.725
-We're gonna have this out!
-Let's do it!

520
01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:33.433
-Get off me!
-You think you're a big man. asshole?

521
01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:40.641
Come on. asshole!

522
01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:44.350
-What the fuck?
-You cut him!

523
01:09:44.641 --> 01:09:46.350
You really think you're
gonna keep the land

524
01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:47.850
and all the gold for yourself?

525
01:09:48.016 --> 01:09:49.475
So you're gonna kill me?

526
01:09:49.683 --> 01:09:51.308
They won't give you the land!

527
01:09:51.433 --> 01:09:53.266
Give me the fucking title!

528
01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.683
What gold. asshole?

529
01:09:55.183 --> 01:09:56.683
-Let me go!
-Piece of shit!

530
01:10:03.516 --> 01:10:05.308
I wasn't taking anything
from you. Culebro!

531
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.058
Let go of me!

532
01:10:11.058 --> 01:10:12.516
You're not taking that land. Rá!

533
01:10:14.975 --> 01:10:17.225
You fucking leech!

534
01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.475
Fuck you. pussy!

535
01:10:38.516 --> 01:10:39.475
Culebro!

536
01:10:42.808 --> 01:10:43.891
Hey. Culebro!

537
01:10:45.058 --> 01:10:46.350
Culebro!

538
01:10:47.266 --> 01:10:49.016
I thought you were tough!
Come on. get up!

539
01:10:49.766 --> 01:10:51.266
Stop trying to scare me!

540
01:10:57.725 --> 01:10:58.641
Hey!

541
01:10:58.975 --> 01:11:00.266
Get up!

542
01:11:05.975 --> 01:11:06.933
Culebro!

543
01:12:45.683 --> 01:12:47.350
GROCERY STORE "EL PROGRESO"

544
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:23.141
<i>Brayan Andrés Villegas Ledesma.</i>

545
01:13:31.683 --> 01:13:32.808
Brayan Andrés?

546
01:13:32.891 --> 01:13:34.266
-Yes. ma'am.
-Villegas Ledesma?

547
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:35.141
Yes. ma'am.

548
01:13:35.308 --> 01:13:36.725
-Did you bring the paperwork?
-Here…

549
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.600
Wait a minute…

550
01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:57.933
-Is this all you have?
-Yes. ma'am.

551
01:14:02.808 --> 01:14:04.641
Who was Mrs. Gilma Ledesma?

552
01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:05.850
My grandmother.

553
01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.475
Your grandmother…

554
01:14:11.225 --> 01:14:13.100
And who are they. relatives?

555
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:15.891
They're friends.
but they're like brothers.

556
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:17.975
They're my family.

557
01:14:20.266 --> 01:14:21.933
Let me see your
identification. please.

558
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.766
So Gilma was the victim
of forced displacement

559
01:14:40.891 --> 01:14:43.225
and she filed the Lawsuit …

560
01:14:43.308 --> 01:14:44.183
That's right.

561
01:14:49.725 --> 01:14:51.100
What about your parents?

562
01:14:51.975 --> 01:14:53.225
Well. my mom…

563
01:14:54.266 --> 01:14:56.725
She died long ago…

564
01:14:57.141 --> 01:15:00.600
I haven't heard from my dad
since they kicked us off the land.

565
01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.683
And my grandmother
left me the land.

566
01:15:06.183 --> 01:15:08.058
So your grandmother left the title
in your name?

567
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:09.225
That's right.

568
01:15:11.058 --> 01:15:12.516
So you're the sole heir.

569
01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:13.766
Yes. ma'am.

570
01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:24.308
Okay… You're missing
your mother's birth certificate.

571
01:15:25.266 --> 01:15:27.766
and her death certificate.

572
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:34.808
Wait here a moment.

573
01:16:06.975 --> 01:16:08.391
Brayan Andrés…

574
01:16:11.516 --> 01:16:14.475
The land is. in fact. yours…

575
01:16:15.975 --> 01:16:17.725
The Court ruled in your favor.

576
01:16:18.766 --> 01:16:20.600
Unfortunately. it's not that easy.

577
01:16:22.016 --> 01:16:23.225
What do you mean?

578
01:16:25.225 --> 01:16:27.016
The ruling has been appealed.

579
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.558
And although technically
the land is yours…

580
01:16:31.516 --> 01:16:34.058
there are other several law suits
pending on those titles.

581
01:16:34.433 --> 01:16:36.725
So the case has to go back to court.

582
01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:43.350
I suggest you hire a lawyer.
a legal consultant.

583
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:47.766
Basically. it's like starting
the process over again. from scratch.

584
01:16:50.308 --> 01:16:51.183
So…

585
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.391
Ma'am. what do you mean?

586
01:16:55.891 --> 01:16:57.516
Is that all you have to say?

587
01:16:57.766 --> 01:17:00.391
Do you know how long
I've been fighting for this?

588
01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:03.516
All the paperwork I had to do
in Medellín just to get here!

589
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.975
To claim what is mine!

590
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.016
My grandmother died
waiting for this. ma'am!

591
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.225
Do I have to die too
to get what's mine?

592
01:17:11.308 --> 01:17:13.600
I'm not asking for any favors!
It's mine!

593
01:17:14.683 --> 01:17:16.058
I'm doing it all legal!

594
01:17:16.141 --> 01:17:18.683
I brought all the papers
and now you're saying "no"?

595
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.391
I'm not asking for any favors!

596
01:17:21.475 --> 01:17:23.766
I'm not stealing anything!
It's mine!

597
01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:27.725
I came all the way here.
I brought all the paperwork!

598
01:17:28.183 --> 01:17:29.683
To claim what is mine!

599
01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:31.766
Mine!
What my grandmother left me!

600
01:17:32.141 --> 01:17:34.433
She fought hard to get it back

601
01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:36.641
and she left it to me!

602
01:17:36.808 --> 01:17:38.058
To nobody else!

603
01:17:38.141 --> 01:17:40.183
It belongs to us and nobody else!

604
01:17:40.433 --> 01:17:42.683
What is this bullshit?

605
01:17:42.766 --> 01:17:43.933
Get serious. man!

606
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.391
You people show some respect!

607
01:21:27.391 --> 01:21:28.641
Rá… Bro!

608
01:21:29.391 --> 01:21:30.558
Hey. bro!

609
01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:33.266
Sere! Hey. Sere!

610
01:21:33.641 --> 01:21:34.683
Bro!

611
01:21:34.808 --> 01:21:36.225
Come on. bro!

612
01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:38.516
Get up. you guys!

613
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.808
Sere. bro!

614
01:21:43.391 --> 01:21:44.516
Get up. man!

615
01:21:50.475 --> 01:21:51.850
Let's get out of here!

616
01:22:15.016 --> 01:22:17.016
Fucking horrible town.

617
01:22:22.391 --> 01:22:24.766
Human beings are fucking horrible.

618
01:22:28.516 --> 01:22:30.766
When do we get to our land?

619
01:22:31.475 --> 01:22:32.600
Don't worry. kid.

620
01:22:32.683 --> 01:22:35.808
Once we get there we'll take
revenge on this fucked up world.

621
01:22:37.516 --> 01:22:39.100
You said it. bro.

622
01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:09.725
TIRES

623
01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.725
Get over there!
Get the fuck over there!

624
01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:02.141
Fill this thing up!
Faster!

625
01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:05.766
Faster!

626
01:25:10.933 --> 01:25:12.808
-You need help or what?
-No.

627
01:25:13.058 --> 01:25:15.266
-No. what?
-No. sir.

628
01:25:16.058 --> 01:25:18.225
Then get the fucking lead out!

629
01:25:19.808 --> 01:25:21.350
Don't you dare call the police!

630
01:25:21.475 --> 01:25:23.516
-Take it easy…
-What do you mean "take it easy"?

631
01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:25.891
-Everything's fine.
-Damn right it is!

632
01:25:26.016 --> 01:25:28.225
-Take it easy. man.
-I am!

633
01:25:29.266 --> 01:25:30.516
Keep your mouth shut!

634
01:26:05.141 --> 01:26:08.933
<i>We do solemnly declare that.</i>
<i>from this moment on.</i>

635
01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.808
<i>we are all equal.</i>

636
01:26:14.475 --> 01:26:15.933
<i>From this moment on.</i>

637
01:26:16.225 --> 01:26:18.475
<i>no one shall have more</i>
<i>than anyone else.</i>

638
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.558
<i>no one shall be worth more</i>
<i>than anyone else.</i>

639
01:26:21.058 --> 01:26:24.391
<i>and all men shall</i>
<i>run free and wild.</i>

640
01:26:25.516 --> 01:26:27.808
<i>How strong I am</i>
<i>because of my hate!</i>

641
01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.600
<i>How strong I am</i>
<i>because of your hate!</i>

642
01:27:40.433 --> 01:27:41.766
Rá. bro!

643
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:45.350
Rá! they're gonna kill us! Shit!

644
01:27:46.516 --> 01:27:48.975
Rá. now they're really gonna kill us!

645
01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:52.516
Rá! They're gonna kill us!

646
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:52.808
Good afternoon. ma'am.

647
01:30:53.016 --> 01:30:54.975
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

648
01:30:55.266 --> 01:30:56.850
What can I get you boys?

649
01:30:57.183 --> 01:30:59.891
Ma'am. can you tell us
how to get to La Sirga?

650
01:31:00.850 --> 01:31:02.225
La Sirga?

651
01:31:02.725 --> 01:31:04.558
Look. it's this piece of land.

652
01:31:07.391 --> 01:31:09.391
Honey. come here a minute!

653
01:31:17.058 --> 01:31:19.100
Can you help these boys?

654
01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:22.266
-Afternoon. boys. how are you?
-Good afternoon. sir.

655
01:31:23.016 --> 01:31:25.141
-How is everything?
-Fine. sir.

656
01:31:28.808 --> 01:31:30.600
Isn't this the Ledesma's land?

657
01:31:30.683 --> 01:31:32.850
That's right.
The Ledesmas are my family.

658
01:31:33.766 --> 01:31:35.433
You're Gilma's grandson?

659
01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.433
Yes. sir. she was my grandma.

660
01:31:38.516 --> 01:31:39.850
May she rest in peace.

661
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:45.016
You're very close. son.
but be very careful.

662
01:31:46.308 --> 01:31:49.600
You know this land isn't
as peaceful as it looks.

663
01:31:49.766 --> 01:31:50.891
Yes. sir.

664
01:31:52.308 --> 01:31:53.391
We'll be careful.

665
01:31:54.516 --> 01:31:58.225
Nobody comes around here…
not anymore.

666
01:31:58.516 --> 01:32:02.266
We're the only ones left.

667
01:32:03.891 --> 01:32:07.266
-Can I ask you something?
-Go ahead. son.

668
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:10.016
Aside from my grandma.
did you know my mom?

669
01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:11.475
What was she like?

670
01:32:11.641 --> 01:32:14.516
She was a lovely person.
a very nice person.

671
01:32:14.725 --> 01:32:17.350
A nice family.
she got along with everyone.

672
01:32:17.808 --> 01:32:21.850
With everyone around here.
when we still had neighbors.

673
01:32:22.225 --> 01:32:23.975
She was sorely missed.

674
01:32:24.308 --> 01:32:25.891
May God bless them.

675
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:31.308
So keep going. boys.
until you come to a big fence.

676
01:32:32.933 --> 01:32:34.516
Turn off and walk
for about 10 minutes.

677
01:32:35.058 --> 01:32:36.808
until you come to some fallen trees.

678
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.058
You'll pass a big mango tree.

679
01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.058
and that's her land.

680
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:47.308
Your grandma's land.
Up against a big hill.

681
01:32:48.266 --> 01:32:50.891
Thank you. sir.
God bless you.

682
01:32:51.975 --> 01:32:54.891
Take this so
you don't get hungry.

683
01:32:55.016 --> 01:32:56.641
God bless you. sir.

684
01:32:56.766 --> 01:32:58.433
May God repay you. sir.

685
01:32:59.933 --> 01:33:01.808
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you very much.

686
01:33:01.891 --> 01:33:04.225
-Be very careful.
-Yes. ma'am.

687
01:34:46.183 --> 01:34:49.600
They won't be looking down on us now!

688
01:34:49.766 --> 01:34:52.600
Let's go get ours. bro!

689
01:38:18.850 --> 01:38:19.850
Winny…

690
01:38:20.558 --> 01:38:22.766
Do you see that horse over there?

691
01:38:26.391 --> 01:38:28.058
Of course I do!
Why?

692
01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:30.141
What's wrong with you?

693
01:39:36.933 --> 01:39:38.183
What is it. bro?

694
01:39:38.266 --> 01:39:40.058
The place is full of gold!

695
01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.891
Trying to camp out here. assholes?

696
01:41:22.308 --> 01:41:23.933
What do you think this is?

697
01:41:24.933 --> 01:41:26.600
You think this place
has no owner?

698
01:41:27.141 --> 01:41:29.266
Huh? You think it belongs to nobody?

699
01:41:30.058 --> 01:41:32.475
Just because the boss isn't here?

700
01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.641
You think you can do
whatever you want? Huh?

701
01:41:40.808 --> 01:41:42.183
Leave now!

702
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:48.558
Do we have to make you leave?

703
01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:56.683
This land has an owner.

704
01:41:58.183 --> 01:42:00.225
It belongs to my boss!

705
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.225
This is no game. pussies.

706
01:42:09.516 --> 01:42:10.850
It's no game.

707
01:42:15.308 --> 01:42:17.975
Nothing to say. idiots?

708
01:42:20.808 --> 01:42:23.058
You're nothing but fucking trash!

709
01:43:37.433 --> 01:43:39.433
<i>I had a dream the other day…</i>

710
01:43:40.225 --> 01:43:41.516
<i>What did you dream?</i>

711
01:43:43.141 --> 01:43:45.433
<i>That all men fell asleep.</i>

712
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:50.100
