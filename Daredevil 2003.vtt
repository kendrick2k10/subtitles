<i>They say your whole life
flashes before your eyes...</i>

<i>when you die.</i>

7
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.510
<i>And it's true...

11
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.200
<i>- He's about to cry.
- And souls don't change with the name.</i>

12
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.530
- Come on. shrimp. Hit me.
I'll give you a free shot.
- Hit him again.

13
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.730

14
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.360
<i>- Come on. Hit me.
- My dad's gonna be champ.</i>

15

- He's a punk.

17
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.850
<i>- Yeah. He's a punk.
- Can't fight.
Sure can run though.</i>

18
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.010
- Pathetic.

19
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.640
<i>My father was a boxer.</i>

20
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.320
<i>- A sportswriter once wrote
that he fought like the devil...</i>

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.890
<i>and the name stuck.</i>

22
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.430
<i>Jack ''The Devil''Murdock
was a contender.</i>

23
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.930
<i>- But that was a long time ago.</i>

24
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.760
Come on. Dad.
Get up.

25
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.010
- Who won?
- Cohan.

26
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.080
Yeah?

27
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.150
- I beat him. you know.
- I know. Dad.

28
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.920
- T.K.O.
- That's right. Matty. You remember.

29
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.830
- Hey. Hey. what's that?
- Nothin'.

30
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.800
I told you I didn't
want you fightin'.

31
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.430
I tried to walk away like you said...

32
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.630
but they kept
givin' me shit.

33
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.760
Don't curse.

34
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.930
What kind of shit?

35
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.740
They said that you work for Fallon.
that you're one of his guys now.

36
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.820
Get over here. Sit down.

37
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.890
Come on.

38
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.420
You think I'd be pullin' double overtime
down at the docks...

39
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.720
if I was workin'
for Fallon?

40
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.660
What. are you nuts?

41
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.670
You don't hit nothin' but books.
Get me?

42
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.070
You be a doctor
or a lawyer.

43
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.110
Not like me.

44
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.400
Dad--

45
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.710
Matt... you can do it.

46
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.910
You can do anything
if you're not afraid.

47
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.990
Now you promise me.

48
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.490
<i>I promise. Dad.</i>

49
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.590
<i>Hey. John. pull that line all the way in...</i>

50
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.830
<i>then bring the crane
around front. all right?</i>

51
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.070
Hey. kid! What are you trying
to get yourself killed?

52
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.900
I'm lookin' for my dad.
Jack Murdock. You seen him?

53
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.000
Murdock? Nah. he ain't
worked here in months.

54
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.380
<i>Now. beat it. huh?</i>

55
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.970
<i>Jack. I don't want you to hurt me.</i>

56
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.630
- I will!
-Jack. come on. I got obligations.

57
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.800
<i>- Dad?
- Okay. I got it.!</i>

58
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.210
Matt?

59
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.220
<i>Matt.!</i>

60
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.670
No!

61
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.270
<i>Matty. I. uh. I talked
to the doctor--</i>

62
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.580
I'm blind.
I know.

63
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.280
- How could you know?
- I heard you talking
in his office.

64
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.720
<i>I hear everything.</i>

65
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.090
Something's happening to me.
Dad. I don't know what it is.

66
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.100
I'm sorry. Matty.

67
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.470
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

68
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.570
<i>We made each other a silent promise.</i>

69
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.540
<i>To never give up.</i>

70
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.090
<i>- To be fearless.</i>

71
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.920
<i>To stick up
for the long shots like us.</i>

72
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.250
<i>We were two fighters
on the comeback trail.</i>

73
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.700
<i>I had lost my sight.
but I got something back in return.</i>

74
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.040
<i>- My remaining four senses...</i>

75
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.610
<i>functioned
with superhuman sharpness.</i>

76
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.780
<i>But most amazing of all...</i>

77
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.450
<i>my sense of sound gave off
a kind of radar sense.</i>

78
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.980
<i>High above the roar
of the streets...</i>

79
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.170
<i>I trained my body
and my senses.</i>

80
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.520
<i>An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...</i>

81
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.510
<i>An acute sense of touch
gave me both strength and balance...</i>

82
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.580
<i>until the city itself
became my playground.</i>

83
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.430
<i>I was the boy without fear.</i>

84
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.230
Whoo-hoo!

85
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.970
- The winner!

86
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.180
<i>Hey. Murdock.! Round two.</i>

87
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.320
<i>- What's up. freak?
- Look at him. man.
Look at his eyes.</i>

88
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.490
Hooo-ooh!

89
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.230
- Kick his ass. man.
- Fight me. I dare ya.

90
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.310
<i>- Yeah. Murdock.
- I dare ya.</i>

91
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.570
<i>That's what I'm sayin' Kick his ass.</i>

92
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.780
<i>Come on. man.
Let's just go.</i>

93
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.110
Okay.

94
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.260
<i>Jack. it's been a while.</i>

95
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.660
- I don't work for you no more. Fallon.

96
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.700
Jack. you never stopped.

97
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.600
Did you really think you won
those fights on your own?

98
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.680
<i>You're 42 years old.</i>

99
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.610
<i>Miller. Mack. Bendez?</i>

100
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.610
They're all my fighters--

101
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.680
just like you.

102
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.950
<i>And now it's your turn
to take a fall.</i>

103
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.360
<i>Think about your boy. Jack.</i>

104
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.930
<i>I'm sure you'll do
the right thing.</i>

105
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.590
Matty.

106
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.060
<i>Stop--
Stop clinching.</i>

107
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.290
<i>Let him go.
Clean fight.</i>

108
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.100
No! Come on. Dad!
Come on. Dad! Get up!

109
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.730
You can do it!
Come on!

110
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.640
<i>Come on. Dad.!
Get up.!</i>

111
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.210
<i>- Come on.!</i>

<i>Never give up.!
Remember?</i>

115
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.160
Yeah! Yeah!
Come on. Dad! All right!

116
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.360
You all right? Murdock! You all right?

117
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.130
<i>- Okay. Let's fight!
- Go. Dad.! Go.!</i>

118
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.940
Ten! He's out!
Fight's over!

119
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.580
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. the winner.
by way ofknockout--</i>

120
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.490
Jack ''The Devil''
Murdock!

121
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.210
<i>This one was for you. Matty.</i>

122
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.780
<i>I waited outside of the Olympic
for my father.</i>

123
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.180
<i>In some ways.
I'm still waiting.</i>

124
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.300
<i>Finish him off!.</i>

125
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.730
Dad!

126
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.160
I can't see you. Dad.

127
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.290
I can't see you.

128
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.290
<i>No one cared much about the death...</i>

129
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.150
<i>of a washed-up prizefighter.</i>

130
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.280
<i>Nobody but me.</i>

131
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.690
<i>I would keep my promise.</i>

132
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.420
<i>I would help those
that others wouldn't.</i>

133
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.130
<i>I would seek justice...</i>

134
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.200
<i>one way...</i>

135
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.570
<i>or another.</i>

136
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.740
dd

137
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.610
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
we're here today...</i>

138
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.120
<i>to seek truth...</i>

139
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.250
<i>to seek justice.</i>

140
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.230
<i>Mr. Quesada. would you
state for the court...</i>

141
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.890
the sequence of events
leading up to the night of June 30?

142
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.630
I stopped off at Josie's Bar
after work.

143
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.900
I had a few drinks.
Angela was there.

144
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.840
<i>She was closing up.
She asked me if I wanted to stick around...</i>

145
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.000
for some fun.

146
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.120
Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.

147
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.930
<i>- Are you aware that perjury is a crime.
Mr. Quesada?
- Objection.</i>

148
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.220
My client is a respectable member
of the community. where Miss Sutton...

149
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.270
- has a history of drug and alcohol abuse...
- My client is not on trial.

150
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.890
- which not only makes
her testimony suspect--
- Nor is her testimony suspect.

151
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.330
<i>- Gentlemen. that's enough.
- The truth is...</i>

152
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.770
Mr. Murdock.
is that Miss Sutton--

153
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.640
<i>Miss Sutton enjoyed
every minute of it.</i>

154
00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.240
Mr. Quesada.
for your sake...

155
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.650
I hope justice
is found here today...

156
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.560
before justice finds you.

157
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.630
<i>Matt? Matt. where
are you going?</i>

158
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.790
Man. we knew this was a risk
going in.

159
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.600
Why? She's from the Kitchen.
she's not from the Upper East Side?

160
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.110
Yeah. Come on. Matt.
She has a history of drug abuse.

161
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.940
- That was a long time ago.
-Juries don't like their victims flawed.

162
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.680
<i> It's not right.</i>

163
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.750
<i>Yeah? Here's what
I don't get.</i>

164
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.910
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsch?

165
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.990
He can't. The Kingpin's
gotta be footing the bill.

166
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:45.290
- Come on. Let's go get drunk.
- Not tonight.

167
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.370
I got work to do.

168
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.900
- d

169
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.800
Line 'em up. Josie.
I'm ready to party tonight.

170
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.540
You got a lot of nerve comin' in here
after what you did.

171
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.810
- Didn't you hear? I'm innocent. baby.

172
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.090
Bikes behind the cage!

173
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.960
No burn-outs.
you assholes!

174
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.370
- Whoo! Yeah!

175
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.080
d

176
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.410
Hey. hey. hey!
What's happenin'?

177
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.490
- Hey. Louie.
- What's up. goombah?

178
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.590
<i>To thejustice system. right?
Of course I beat it.</i>

179
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.190
<i>Kingpin's got my back. bro.
How ya doin' sweetie?</i>

180
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.270
- Boss.
- What's up?

181
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.340
What's up with that?

182
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.410
Is that guy for real?

183
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.600
Yeah. he's for real.

184
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.450
<i>- What do you want?
-Justice.</i>

185
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.610
d

186
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.780
Quesada!

187
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.690
Time to give the devil
his due.

188
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.600
Oh. God!
Oh. God!

189
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.370
- Hi. How ya doin'?

190
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.380
Didn't you hear?

191
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.880
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.

192
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.950
Who made you judge?

193
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.460
Wh-- You did.

194
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.070
- Go to hell...diablo.

195
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.870
Okay. but you'll
beat me there.

196
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.890
<i>Hey. That light...</i>

197
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.290
<i>at the end
of the tunnel?</i>

198
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.420
Guess what?
That's not heaven.

199
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.760
- I'll kill you!
- That's the ''C'' Train.

200
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.770
Oh. my God!

201
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.750
Hey. You can't
go past there.

202
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.110
- Call Charlie.
- Right.

203
00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.620
You're wastin'
your time. Urich.

204
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.660
<i>- There's nothin' to see here.
- Jose Quesada...</i>

205
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.430
and the rest
of Jose Quesada.

206
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.260
Whole lotta nothin'.
Huh. Nick?

207
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.330
You keep runnin' those stories.
and we're gonna end up with
a bunch of copycat vigilantes...

208
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.400
who are gonna
get themselves killed.

209
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.670
Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this. Detective?

210
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.270
Come on. Urich.
Stop bustin' my--

211
00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.510
There is no proof that your so-called
Daredevil was involved...

212
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.050
nor that
he even exists.

213
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.520
- Got it?

214
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.200
Got it.

215
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.550
<i>Can one man make a difference?</i>

216
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.090
<i>There are days
when I believe...</i>

217
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.160
<i>and others when I have
lost all faith.</i>

218
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:13.460
<i>Matt. it's Heather. Are you there?</i>

219
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.730
<i>Of course you're not there.
You're never there.</i>

220
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.170
<i>At least not for me.</i>

221
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.430
<i>Look. I didn't wanna do this
over the phone...</i>

222
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.530
<i>but it's not like you've
given me any choice.</i>

223
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.870
<i>I mean. it's been
three months now...</i>

224
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.880
<i>and I've never even
seen your apartment.</i>

225
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.250
<i>Every time we sleep together.
I wake up in the morning alone.</i>

226
00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:37.220
<i>I mean. Jesus. where do you go
at 3..00 in the morning?</i>

227
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.890
<i>I thought that if I waited.
if I was patient enough.you'd let me in...</i>

228
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.460
<i>that we'd take our relationship
to the next level.</i>

229
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.560
<i>Then I realized
that this is the next level.</i>

230
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.130
<i>Good-bye. Matt. I hope you find
what you're looking for.</i>

231
00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.980
<i>- Please. don't hurt me.</i>

232
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.980
<i>- Please. don't do that.</i>

233
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:17.110
Shh. Sleep now.

234
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:43.400
Listen to this. ''Eyewitnesses say that
Quesada was singled out...

235
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.140
by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil.''

236
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.110
I don't know why
you read that trash.

237
00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:53.310
- I've been hearin' stories for years.
Gotta be somethin' to it.
- Like alligators in the sewers?

238
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.480
There are alligators in the sewers.
I got a friend in Sanitation. He's seen them.

239
00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.390
Fine. Just drop it.

240
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.050
You should see this guy.
They got this picture--

241
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.460
- They have a picture?
- It's. like. a drawing. an artist's rendering.

242
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.730
It's just--
It's grotesque.

243
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:11.230
I'd hate to see this guy's
therapy bills.

244
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.400
Speaking of bills. your client Mr. Lee.
he made his first payment.

245
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.480
- That's great. You should be very happy.
- Yeah. it's fantastic.

246
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.840
He paid in fluke.
Fluke is a fish. Matt.

247
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.640
Did you know that?
I sure as hell didn't.

248
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.080
Mr. Lee is a good man. and he...
doesn't have a lot of money...

249
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.590
and he goes fishing
on the weekends.

250
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.420
I go salsa dancing weekends. but I don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.

251
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.860
Pass the honey. please.

252
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.590
We need some better clients.
I'm tired of these pro bono cases.

253
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.530
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good. honorable clients.

254
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.930
Decent people. What's your idea of''better''?
Define ''better.''

255
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.470
- What would be a better client?
- ''Better'' means rich and guilty. Okay?

256
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.550
<i>Remember when they taught us in law
school how to create a moral vacuum...</i>

257
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.840
so you could represent people
who aren't all necessarily innocent?

258
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.920
That was your best course.
as I recall.

259
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.010
You don't have
a moral vacuum.

260
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.520
- You are completely vacuumless.

261
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.520
And what happened
to your face?

262
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.820
Nothing. A small cut.
I walked into a door.

263
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:13.760
Every time you disappear.
we can't get ahold of you.
you come in all cut up.

264
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.500
I'm in the fight club.
The first rule of fight club:
Don't talk about fight club.

265
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.270
- You're not in the fight club.
you're out of it.
- I didn't see the movie.

266
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.100
I'm sure it's a funny joke.
but I didn't see it.

267
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:28.200
Okay. all I'm sayin'
is I'm here for you as a friend.

268
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.940
I hate to bring it up again. but I spent
$3.000 on that Seeing Eye dog.

269
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.580
- I didn't ask you for the dog.
- Can I say something else?

270
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.280
Seeing Eye dogs bond for life--
yours ran away.

271
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:41.220
What does that tell you about
how emotionally available you are?

272
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.960
- What? What? Where? Where?

273
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.660
Front door.
Not yet. Soon.

274
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.670
<i>Now.</i>

275
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.910
Tell me.

276
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.080
<i>- You want the truth?
-Absolutely.</i>

277
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:15.130
She's hideous.
I don't know if it's a fungus...

278
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.350
or some sort of
congenital birth defect.

279
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.920
<i>But as your attorney in this matter.
I advise you...</i>

280
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.860
take no further action.

281
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.770
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

282
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.970
Uh... I was just
looking for some honey.

283
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.880
<i>- Could you help me out?
- Right in front of you.</i>

284
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.210
<i>Well...</i>

285
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.450
could you be a little bit
more specific?

286
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.790
- What are you--
- Blind? Yeah.

287
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:50.380
<i>- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.</i>

288
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.760
The. uh--

289
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.960
- Friend of yours?
- I've never seen him before.

290
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.170
Matt Murdock.

291
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.270
Nice to meet you.
Matt Murdock.

292
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.570
Nice to meet you.
Uh--

293
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.150
I didn't get your name.

294
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.950
I didn't give it.

295
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.300
<i>I tell ya. some people have no compassion
for the handicapped.</i>

296
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.420
Apparently not.

297
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.590
- Where you goin'?
- Gonna file an appeal.

298
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.640
We have to be in the courthouse
by noon.

299
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.710
<i>- 1 2..00. Matt.
- I'll be there.</i>

300
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:51.950
- What do you want?
- I just wanted to get your name.

301
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.960
- I didn't want any trouble.
- Look...

302
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.620
I don't like being followed.
so don't.

303
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:01.630
Uh. wait a minute.

304
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.130
Wait a second.
Take it easy.

305
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.370
And I don't like
being touched.

306
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.310
Why don't you tell me what you do like.
and we'll start there.

307
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.990
Sure you're blind?

308
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.030
Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?

309
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.530
- You're holding back.
- Yes.

310
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.460
Don't.

311
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.130
Does every guy have to go through
all this to find out your name?

312
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.540
Try asking for my number.

313
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.970
<i>Fight.! Fight.! Fight.!</i>

314
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.290
Stop hitting me.

315
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.230
- Okay.

316
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.030
My name's
Elektra Natchios.

317
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.340
Thanks. That's all
I wanted to know.

318
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.380
I have to go.

319
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.120
Go? Wait a second.
Hold on.

320
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.590
D-Don't-- I don't wanna
get my ass kicked again...

321
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.660
I just want to know
why you have to go.

322
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.830
My bodyguard is here.

323
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.670
Your bodyguard?

324
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.710
<i>If you need a bodyguard.
I'm in serious trouble.</i>

325
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.170
I thought I lost him
at the coffee shop.

326
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.340
Dad can be a little
overprotective.

327
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.540
Oh. ''Natchios.'' Right.
as in ''Nikolas Natchios.''

328
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.550
- That's Dad.

329
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.420
How am I going
to find you?

330
00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.760
You won't.

331
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.560
I'll find you.

332
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.340
Shit!

333
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.780
- What's wrong. Wesley?
- Have you seen the papers today?

334
00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:50.790
Somebody's
been talking.

335
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.860
Somebody always does.

336
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:59.970
Wesley. did you know.
back in ancient times...

337
00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:05.100
they would cut the tongues
out of their bodyguards
their first day on the job?

338
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.010
You think that's horrible.
don't you?

339
00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:12.020
<i>'Cause you don't like
the physical stuff.</i>

340
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.180
I do.

341
00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.330
Whoo!

342
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.770
Wesley. handkerchief.

343
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.680
Your 1 1 :00 is here.

344
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.810
Natchios.
my dear old friend.

345
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:06.270
I'm getting out. Wilson.
Uh-- I am out.

346
00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:10.900
- You think it's funny?

347
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.410
<i>- They're writing about the Kingpin.</i>

348
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.500
<i>They're going back
to the beginning.</i>

349
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.950
Oh. I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

350
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:23.580
I wanna put all that behind me.
I want you to buy me out.

351
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:27.280
I think you'll find this
a very generous offer.

352
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.260
So. what do you say?

353
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.850
How's your daughter?

354
00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.120
<i>I said I was sorry. What do you want?</i>

355
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.550
Details.
You owe me that.

356
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.930
Her name's
Elektra Natchios.

357
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.520
She sounds like
a Mexican appetizer.

358
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:08.900
It's Greek. genius.
Her father's Nikolas Natchios.

359
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.530
- The billionaire?
- Yeah. See? Yes. the billionaire.

360
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.840
Then as your attorney in this matter.
I advise you to marry the woman immediately.

361
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.030
I'll take it
under consideration.

362
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.010
- What do we got?
- Oh. this one's a real winner.

363
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.080
Daunte Jackson.
ex-con from Queens...

364
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.480
charged with the August 9th
murder of Lisa Tazio--

365
00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:29.580
your friendly neighborhood
prostitute.

366
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.350
The bad news is Jackson
was found passed-out in an alley...

367
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.520
holding the murder weapon...

368
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.060
and enough THC in his lungs
to get Staten Island high.

369
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.030
Jackson says he can't remember
what happened on the night of the murder...

370
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.070
or. for that matter.
most of the '90s.

371
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:46.800
- What's the good news?
- The fluke wasn't bad. Could you let us in?

372
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.000
Mr. Jackson.

373
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.140
Who are you?

374
00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.810
We're your attorneys.

375
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.620
<i>If you're innocent.</i>

376
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.490
So. are you...
innocent?

377
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:11.760
- Yeah.

378
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.490
<i>Hell yeah.</i>

379
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.790
I believe you.

380
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.800
Y-You do?

381
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:25.640
- You do?
- You got yourself a defense.

382
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.180
Thank you.
Thank you. sir.

383
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.680
I want you to create
a paper trail...

384
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:38.780
one that can be
traced to Natchios.

385
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:44.350
- Sir?
- The press want a kingpin.
so I'll give 'em a kingpin.

386
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.560
Get me Bullseye.

387
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.590
Two out of three.

388
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:42.680
Bloody Irish piece of trash.

389
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.400
What do you think Jackson's
gonna pay us with? Chronic?

390
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.480
- Foggy.
- Hey. the guy's a three-time loser.

391
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.740
They found him a block away
with the murder weapon.

392
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:43.970
Which makes the fact
that he's innocent interesting.

393
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.050
How can you be
so sure?

394
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.280
- Have I ever been wrong?
- No. Which is really starting to annoy me.

395
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.290
Hey! Come on.
I got a blind guy here!

396
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:55.830
- Use the crosswalk. asshole.
- I love this city.

397
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.670
Empty your pockets.

398
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.520
Raise your arms.

399
00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.100
All right.
This is it.

400
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:21.300
- Okay. now what?
- Take a look around.

401
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:24.070
I know you have a built-in
bullshit detector...

402
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.280
but this time
it's on the blink.

403
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.720
- Let's say Jackson is innocent...
- He is innocent.

404
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.290
then why go through the trouble
to set him up?

405
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:35.360
Why the big cover-up
in the death of a prostitute?

406
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.720
I don't know.
I can't answer that.

407
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:41.360
I gotta find out more
about Lisa Tazio.

408
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.630
Well. you know.
too bad we don't have a key.

409
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.270
Matt. Matt.
where are you going?

410
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.540
- Give me your pen.
- Right here. Leave a note?

411
00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:00.420
- Here.
- That's my pen.

412
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.800
I must've been sick
the day they taught that.

413
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.800
Was that
real estate law?

414
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.270
- What do you see?
- What do I see? I see high ceilings...

415
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:28.000
<i>I see hardwood floors under carpet.
I see some good feng shui--</i>

416
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:31.310
<i>- Think they rented this place yet?</i>

417
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.830
What did she have
a puppy?

418
00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.770
- Ammonia.
- So what?

419
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.570
Over blood.

420
00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.370
Something else.

421
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.380
Cordite-- gunpowder.

422
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:43.450
She was shot here
and dragged outside...

423
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.580
to make it look
like a random robbery.

424
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.400
<i>Come on. Matt.
there's nothin'over there. Let's go.</i>

425
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.930
<i>Write this down.</i>

426
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.510
She wrote something here
in a ballpoint pen.

427
00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:06.440
<i>The imprint is still
in the wood.</i>

428
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:10.540
<i>- ''M-O-M. ''
- ''M-O-M.''</i>

429
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.620
<i>- ''6-8.''
- ''6-8. ''</i>

430
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.240
There. I knew it.
Her mother did it.

431
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.260
Now can we please go
before we need attorneys too?

432
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.190
<i>Susie is my son Larry's daughter
by his first marriage.</i>

433
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:28.030
<i>She eloped with this semi-colored fella
from London.</i>

434
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.260
What's the word for that?
Mulatto. Yeah.

435
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:33.240
Just let's say he had a little cream
in his coffee.

436
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.770
<i>But he did very well for himself
on the Internet...</i>

437
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:38.840
but don't ask me how.

438
00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.610
You know. they did get me
a computer for Christmas last year.

439
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:46.240
But I won't use it. I'm afraid
it's going to explode.

440
00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:48.840
<i>Oh. but who can afford
to fly these days?</i>

441
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:54.410
<i>But then my sister Marjorie
called and said she had
these frequent flyer miles...</i>

442
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:58.290
<i>and she couldn't use them
because her sciatic nerve was acting up.</i>

443
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.160
<i>So I said--</i>

444
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.070
d

445
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.250
Oh. She's sleeping.

446
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:18.410
Oh. She's sleeping.

447
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:23.250
- Can I get you anything before we land?
- More peanuts. please.

448
00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.480
<i>Bill Evert here
at the Manhattan Courthouse...</i>

449
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.560
where accused killer
Daunte Jackson--

450
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.960
<i>Jackson is accused of gunning down--</i>

451
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:36.500
Ladies and Gentlemen
of the jury...

452
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.090
I am not here to convice you
that Daunte Jackson is a model citizen.

453
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:45.270
<i>He has been in and out
of prisons and reform schools
since he was 12 years old...</i>

454
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.810
<i>but this is not a court
of character. however...</i>

455
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:49.940
This is a court of law.

456
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.310
Isn't he facing
the wrong way?

457
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.440
Don't worry. he's got them
right where he wants them.

458
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:57.350
<i>- Daunte Jackson is innocent.
- Yeah.</i>

459
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:02.130
And that is what it's been like
for Mr. Jackson.

460
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.960
Like trying to talk
to a wall.

461
00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:08.960
Does this defense come with
a two-drink minimum. Mr. Murdock?

462
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.800
I'm sorry. Your Honor.
I'm trying to make a point.

463
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.700
You see.justice is blind...

464
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:19.040
<i>but it can be heard...</i>

465
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.480
and. today. the truth will come out.
Thank you.

466
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.510
Here. r-r-right this way.

467
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:30.210
He's blind.
He can't see anything.

468
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.410
Okay. here's the. uh. the arm.

469
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.490
You got the arm there.
Matt?

470
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.250
Just reach down.
There you go.

471
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.450
- I'm sorry.

472
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.760
Here we go.

473
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:46.060
You got it?
Okay.

474
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:49.110
- Was that too much?
- Yeah. it was a little much.

475
00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:52.610
You always want to do the chair thing.
It's embarrassing.

476
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:54.870
<i>- We want sympathy. it's not The Gong Show.
- Okay.</i>

477
00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:59.180
Officer McKensie. you were
the arriving officer at the scene?

478
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.280
- That's correct.
- Please tell us what you observed.

479
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:08.790
I was a block away when I got the call
of shots being fired.

480
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:11.660
When I arrived on the scene.
Lisa Tazio's body...

481
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.820
was lying dead
on the steps of her apartment.

482
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.290
<i>- I found Jackson passed out in the alley.</i>

483
00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.000
<i>- Still holding the murder weapon.
- What's wrong?</i>

484
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.970
<i>- Tazio's wallet in his pocket.
- McKensie's telling the truth.</i>

485
00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.100
Yeah. that happens
sometimes in court.

486
00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:32.410
No. no. no. no.
Somebody has to be lying.

487
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.750
- What's he doing here?
- Who?

488
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:45.060
<i>It's Ben Urich.
the reporter from the Post.</i>

489
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:57.760
So does this mean you want a rematch?

490
00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.840
I told you
I'd find you.

491
01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.820
- How did you know I wasn't a mugger?

492
01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.520
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels...

493
01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.650
at least this far
from Chelsea.

494
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.920
<i>Come here.</i>

495
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:22.430
<i>- There's something I wanna show you.
- Wait a second.</i>

496
01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.060
Exactly how many women
have you brought up here?

497
01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:29.230
Uh... you're my first.

498
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.310
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.

499
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:40.280
<i>Look at this. It's so beautiful.</i>

500
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.750
I know. This was my favorite
view of the city when I was a kid.

501
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.320
<i>I really wanted you
to see this.</i>

502
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.120
What's this?

503
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:08.130
Oh. that's from
my mother.

504
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.140
For good luck.

505
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.140
It's beautiful.
It's a good luck charm. huh?

506
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.210
I could use one of those.
They make them in braille?

507
01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:25.580
She gave it to me...
right before she died.

508
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.880
What happened?

509
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.180
She was killed...

510
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.690
right in front of me--
I was five.

511
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.160
I'm sorry.

512
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:43.260
No Greek tragedies. okay?

513
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.430
Okay.

514
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.000
<i>- I should go.
- No. no. Wait. Just wait.</i>

515
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:54.270
Wait. wait. wait.
Because it-it's-- It's about to rain.

516
01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.750
<i>- No. it's not.
- It is. It's-- I'm telling you.</i>

517
01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.450
The temperature dropped
two or three degrees. I can smell it.

518
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.420
The moisture in the air.
It's gonna rain any second now.

519
01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.020
And when it rains. it's like
there's a rooftop on the world.

520
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:12.620
<i>Each raindrop makes a sound
the first time it falls on a surface.</i>

521
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.720
<i>Just then it's like I--</i>

522
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.830
It's like
I can see again.

523
01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.370
And I--
I just wanna--

524
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.450
I just wanna see you.

525
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.740
Okay.

526
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.250
Look. Here it comes.

527
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.360
Ah.

528
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.950
<i>Oh. my God.</i>

529
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.390
You are so beautiful.

530
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.450
<i>Maybe you remember the Kingpin.</i>

531
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.350
<i>- You remember now?</i>

532
01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.150
<i>- What?
- Get off me.!</i>

533
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.430
<i>- Matt. what's wrong?
- You think you can
hold out on the Kingpin?</i>

534
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.300
- Matt.

535
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.900
I have to go.

536
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:02.980
<i>- I'm sorry.
- You remember now?</i>

537
01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.540
I have to go.

538
01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:09.840
Matt.

539
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:11.920
Matt.

540
01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.990
Oh. no! No. no! Please!

541
01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.390
Huh? You remember me now?
What are you. stupid?

542
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.530
You think you can
hold out on the Kingpin?

543
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.060
Get away from me!

544
01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.950
Stay out of Hell's Kitchen.

545
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.750
This ain't
your neighborhood no more.

546
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.020
Kitchen belongs
to the Kingpin now.

547
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.940
Please!

548
01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:54.140
<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>

549
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.980
- I'm not the bad guy. kid.

550
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:13.700
I'm not the bad guy.

551
01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.770
I'm not.

552
01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.650
<i>You know the great strength
of the Church?</i>

553
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.860
Its sense of community.

554
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:48.370
<i>- Good morning. Father.
- Good morning.</i>

555
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:53.030
Now. this may come
as a bit of a surprise to you. Matthew...

556
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.660
but we are open
on Sundays.

557
01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.680
I like the quiet.

558
01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.840
I don't think so. son.
I think you like the solitude.

559
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.180
And you find it in here.
do you. Matthew?

560
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.620
Sometimes.

561
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.810
Sometimes not.

562
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:38.610
<i>You don't have to
go it alone. Matthew.</i>

563
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.020
My confessional is open
to you all the time.

564
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.180
<i>There's no keepin'
secrets from God. son.</i>

565
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:50.230
You spend 30 years in one of them boxes.
there's nothing I haven't heard.

566
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.860
Well. let's keep it
that way.

567
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.740
So. we'll be seein' ya
Sunday then. huh?

568
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.230
- I'll have to call you back
because he just came in.

569
01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:30.460
Good morning.

570
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.940
- Your ears must have been burning.
- Why?

571
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.530
This just came
by messenger.

572
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.580
It's your invitation
to the Black & White Ball at the Grand.

573
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.110
- Plus one.
- Plus one? All right.

574
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.750
Coffee?

575
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:49.290
Uh. no. No. thank you.

576
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:51.520
I'd love a cup. Karen.
Thank you.

577
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.600
I guess she's making
a fresh pot.

578
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.460
<i>- Wow.</i>

579
01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:04.060
They spent some serious money
on this invitation.

580
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:06.900
I mean. you should feel it.
It's engraved.

581
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:10.200
- What time you gonna pick me up?
- I'm not goin'.

582
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:12.440
What? Are you crazy?

583
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.270
That place is gonna be crawlin'
with people-- rich people.

584
01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.410
People who pay their legal fees
with money. not with fish...

585
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.540
or with-with-with wheels of cheese
or with sports supplies.

586
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.620
<i>I'm gonna fill you in
on a little secret. Matt.</i>

587
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.190
<i>This place doesn't look
like a law office. okay?</i>

588
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:29.280
<i>It looks like the set
of goddamn Sanford and Son.</i>

589
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.800
Every time I walk in. I'm waiting for Lamont
to walk down the stairs.

590
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.560
- Then you go.
- Look at me. Matt. I'm a ''plus one.'' okay?

591
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.640
<i>Plus ones don't get
anywhere by themselves.</i>

592
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.900
They need somebody to bring them.
That's why it's ''plus one.''

593
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.740
Are you finished? We only have an hour
to prepare for court.

594
01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.540
What's eating you?

595
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.310
I had a--
a rough night.

596
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.510
<i>Well.you wanna
talk about it?</i>

597
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.820
No.

598
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:05.260
- It's about Elektra. isn't it?
- No.

599
01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.320
Natchios owns the Grand Hotel.
and Elektra's the reason you
were invited to the ball.

600
01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.370
She's outta my league.
I'd rather just end it before it starts.

601
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.940
That's gotta be
some kind of record.

602
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.380
You just completely bypassed
the whole relationship phase.

603
01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.780
You went right to the breakup.
Tryin' to save some time. huh?

604
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.510
<i>What happens to that
lie detector of yours when it
detects your own bullshit?</i>

605
01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.920
It must really
bury the needle. huh?

606
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.520
- Swish.

607
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.590
<i>Look. Matt. seriously.
the ball's in your court.</i>

608
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.100
Plus one. huh?

609
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.140
Thank you.

610
01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.150
<i> This is what
I'm talking about. Aren't you
happy you listened to me?</i>

611
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.190
This is gonna be great
for business. Matt.

612
01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:03.950
Thank you.

613
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.920
<i>Matt Murdock.
Ben Urich. New York Post.</i>

614
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:10.550
<i>Ben Urich. Nice to meet you.
You're the guy...</i>

615
01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:15.070
- who writes the articles about
the urban legends. right?
- Well. yes. among other things.

616
01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.070
Maybe you could settle
something for us.

617
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:19.190
You know the alligators
that live in the sewers?

618
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:22.430
- My partner--
- I've been following that piece
you wrote about the Kingpin.

619
01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.570
One man running all the crime
in New York City--

620
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.580
it sounds a little
farfetched. doesn't it?

621
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.950
Well. yeah. But then again
so's a vigilante who thinks
every day is Halloween.

622
01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:35.380
They got to be huge by now.
right. the alligators?

623
01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:38.920
It's a myth.

624
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:44.050
<i>Look. uh. I'd like you
to give me a call--Sorry.</i>

625
01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.770
- Cool color.
- I wouldn't know.

626
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:56.570
But do give me a call.
There is something I'd like
to talk to you about.

627
01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.810
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy the party.

628
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:05.650
Uh. uh. uh. Look at that.
Wilson Fisk is in the ''hizzie.''

629
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:09.480
<i>Come on. We might never
get a chance like this again.
Come on. let's go. Come on.</i>

630
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:11.490
- We should talk about this--
- Mr. Fisk.

631
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:15.030
Mr. Fisk. it's. uh. uh. Franklin Nelson
from Nelson & Murdock--

632
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:19.860
Excuse me. You want to talk to Mr. Fisk.
you make an appointment. Okay?

633
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:23.590
Wesley.
I know who you are.

634
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.140
You're the blind lawyers
from Hell's Kitchen.

635
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.040
Actually-- Actually.
he's the blind one.

636
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.270
I'm deaf.

637
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.940
Give 'em a card. Wesley.

638
01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.540
I'm always on the lookout
for new blood.

639
01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:40.710
I'm sorry. Mr. Fisk. My partner is a little
overzealous. We can't represent you.

640
01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.720
Why is that?

641
01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.810
Yes. why is that. Mr. Murdock?

642
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.450
Because we only handle
clients who are innocent.

643
01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.970
Innocent. he says. That's pretty funny.

644
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.700
You know. I've learned one thing
in all my years in this business.

645
01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.670
- What's that?
- Nobody's innocent.

646
01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:04.470
Nobody.

647
01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:09.310
- Have a great time at the party.
- Thank you.

648
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.510
<i>I just.you know--
Matt. for one night. I just wish--</i>

649
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.720
I just--

650
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.990
<i>Matt. I just wish I could give you my eyes
for one night.</i>

651
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.590
<i>- It's like that?
- It's like that.</i>

652
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:32.600
You want me to take you
up there. Matt? Matt?

653
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.670
<i>Matt?</i>

654
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.880
<i>Now I found you.</i>

655
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.520
Look. I'm really sorry
about the other night.

656
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.150
You're here now.

657
01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.590
That's all that matters.

658
01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.600
<i>Wow. Engraved
cufflinks. huh?</i>

659
01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.670
Because it's
Wesley Owen Welch.

660
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:40.100
Let's cut to the chase.
If this were up to me-- and it is--

661
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:43.200
Do you really think the Fisk Corporation
would actually hire...

662
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:48.250
some pro bono. storefront
Hell's Kitchen lawyers. let alone a blind one.

663
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:50.610
Come on.
I've already filled...

664
01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.380
our quota of handicapped employees
for the year.

665
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:59.120
Go back to the Kitchen.
Franklin Nelson.

666
01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:05.650
What a dick.

667
01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.730
d

668
01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:13.470
You look
beautiful tonight.

669
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.870
Do you mind?

670
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:28.180
Uh. no. I just-- Sometimes it makes people
uncomfortable. that's all.

671
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.150
Not me.

672
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.990
But you should know...

673
01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:39.500
that the only reason
I got dressed up for this thing...

674
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.800
was that I wanted
to look beautiful for you.

675
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:47.740
I wish you could
see me tonight.

676
01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.010
Me too.

677
01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:01.240
- Matt.
- What's wrong?

678
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:03.320
Uh. it's just...

679
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.050
good things don't
happen to me very often.

680
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.420
When they do.
I get scared.

681
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.900
Nothing bad
is gonna happen.

682
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.990
I promise.

683
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.040
Hi. Hello.

684
01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:34.120
Hello.

685
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.320
Hello.

686
01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:49.000
Oh. doesn't she look
beautiful?

687
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.400
I think she's happy.

688
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.460
I haven't seen her smile like that
since before her mother was killed.

689
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:59.100
<i>Poor girl.
Right in front ofher eyes.</i>

690
01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:01.200
Why do you have
to bring that up now?

691
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:04.770
History has a way
of repeating itself.

692
01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.940
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying good-bye. old friend.

693
01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:14.220
I'm just saying
good-bye.

694
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.800
Gus.

695
01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:32.200
- Something's happening. Papa.
- What is it?

696
01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.170
- Go back to the party.
- What's wrong?

697
01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:43.450
Elektra!
Stavros will take you home.

698
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.620
Papa? Papa?

699
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:49.350
- Tell me where you're going.

700
01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.760
You wait-- Ooh!

701
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.470
I'm sorry.

702
01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:46.380
- What is going on? Tell me.
- New York is not a safe place tonight.

703
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:11.170
- Watch out!

704
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.830
I missed.
I never miss.

705
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.360
Drop somethin'?

706
01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.650
Bullseye. huh?

707
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.590
Daddy.

708
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.210
<i>Get that over
to Forensics right away.</i>

709
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.490
- Hey. Nick.
- What do you want. Urich?
Does all this make you happy?

710
01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:47.560
Looks like
you got your story.

711
01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.760
<i> Police are still
investigating the murder
of Greek shipping heir--</i>

712
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:32.270
<i> Nikolas Natchios
as the so-called Kingpin of crime--</i>

713
01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.070
<i> The self-styled vigilante
is wanted for murder.</i>

714
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.190
Now how did you
get past my security?

715
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:47.690
Oh. you mean that guy?

716
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:49.450
Was that really necessary?

717
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.530
Necessary. no.
It was fun.

718
01:22:52.630 --> 01:22:56.960
You know. you've exceeded
all my expectations.

719
01:22:57.070 --> 01:23:00.040
<i>You even managed to implicate
Daredevil in the process.</i>

720
01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.040
You should be pleased.

721
01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:05.580
He... made me...

722
01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.480
miss.

723
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:14.810
There's an old saying that
''too much pride can kill a man.''

724
01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.660
The Devil is mine.

725
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.990
Really?
I've heard that before...

726
01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.720
<i>all too many times.</i>

727
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:29.730
But answer me this.

728
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:33.130
How do you kill a man
without fear?

729
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.730
By puttin'
the fear in him.

730
01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.740
Ah. I like that.
But first...

731
01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:48.810
<i>give Elektra all my best.</i>

732
01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.010
Is there anything else?

733
01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.250
Yeah.

734
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:59.600
I want a fuckin' costume.

735
01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.570
And what happened from there.
Mr. Jackson?

736
01:24:07.670 --> 01:24:09.660
Well. let's see.
uh--

737
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:14.270
Man. I was so high.
I can't remember everything.

738
01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:21.050
Excuse me one second.
Your Honor. I'm working alone today.

739
01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:23.750
<i>Just a second.</i>

740
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.690
It's braille.
It's braille.

741
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:35.800
It says here. okay--

742
01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.530
Mr. Jackson. it says here
that you were...

743
01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.540
at Chumley's Tavern
until 1 0:1 5...

744
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.900
and then you went
to meet a friend.

745
01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:45.980
Turk!

746
01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.450
<i>- I went to meet Turk
because he owed me money.
- Yes.!</i>

747
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:54.420
And it was there that you
passed out from drinking. correct?

748
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:58.180
Smoking weed. mostly.

749
01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:02.680
Thank you
for clarifying that.

750
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:06.820
Now. Officer McKensie has testified
you were found holding a handgun.

751
01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:10.830
- That's a lie!
- In fact. you don't even
own a handgun. do you?

752
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.800
- No. sir.
- Have you ever owned
a handgun. Mr. Jackson?

753
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:18.400
- No. sir.
- Do you have any intention
of owning a handgun?

754
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:20.840
- No. sir.
- Thank you.

755
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:24.400
<i>- Can't hit nothin'with a handgun.
- Thank you.</i>

756
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.140
But a shotgun. now that's
a whole different story.

757
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:30.780
<i>- Shotgun got buckshot--like little pellets.
- Thank you. That's all.</i>

758
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:33.980
When you shoot.
they just kind of spray out.

759
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:36.960
Thank you. Mr. Jackson.
I have no further questions. Your Honor.

760
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.320
Court's in recess!

761
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.690
Mr. Nelson.

762
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.870
For your sake. I hope your partner
comes back soon.

763
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:52.940
Me too.
Me too.

764
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.830
- I know how you feel.
- You don't know how I feel.

765
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.030
I want revenge.

766
01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.580
Revenge won't make the pain go away.
Trust me. I know.

767
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:10.680
<i>- There's no place for me now.
- Yes. there is.</i>

768
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:15.950
Stay.
Stay with me.

769
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:20.090
<i>Please.</i>

770
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:58.060
Elektra. Elektra. wait.

771
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.800
Please.

772
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:17.980
Drive.

773
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:48.480
<i>- Matt.
- Why are you following me?</i>

774
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:51.920
- It's Ben Urich.
- I know who it is.

775
01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.230
What do you want?

776
01:29:01.330 --> 01:29:03.390
Your client's innocent.

777
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:18.940
Well?

778
01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:24.750
I had a source from my Kingpin story
named Lisa Tazio.

779
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:28.380
<i>- Lisa Tazio had access to the Kingpin?
- No.</i>

780
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:30.790
One of his guys--
pillow talk.

781
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:34.060
She was selling me information bit by bit.
I never got a name.

782
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:36.160
Will you testify
to that?

783
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:40.930
Well. First Amendment and all that.
plus the case is still open.

784
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.000
Is there anything that you can tell me
that will help my client?

785
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:49.600
Yeah. I got a cousin over in Hoboken.
runs a Mercedes dealership.

786
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:53.210
He sold a 500 SL...
to a Robert McKensie.

787
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:57.680
Officer McKensie.

788
01:29:57.790 --> 01:30:00.780
<i>- That doesn't make sense.
He was telling the truth.
- Matt.</i>

789
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:04.220
That's three years cop's salary.
The guy ain't tellin' the truth.

790
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:18.930
A future. Our future.
Our children.

791
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.920
Hey.

792
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.230
- Gotta love that new car smell. McKensie.
- Murdock. what the--

793
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.300
<i>Never driven one of these stick-shifts before.
How does this work?</i>

794
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:51.070
- Stop it!
- Take it easy. McKensie. we'll go for a ride.

795
01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.740
- This is a nice car. Where'd you get this?
- Lots of cops got Mercedes.

796
01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:57.310
Yeah? I bet.

797
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:02.880
Jesus Christ!
You're crazy.

798
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:05.320
Yeah. I'm crazy.
Who killed Lisa Tazio?

799
01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.120
Daunte Jackson.

800
01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:12.420
Stop the goddamn car!

801
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:15.760
Here's the hard part-- parallel parking.
How is it? Like this?

802
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:21.030
What do you want?

803
01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:24.600
I want to know why your goddamn
heart rate hasn't changed!

804
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:32.000
Shit.

805
01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.520
- When'd you get the pacemaker?
- Three years ago. So what?

806
01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.780
You lied in court.
That's perjury.

807
01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:41.550
You think I'm the only one?

808
01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.360
You take me down.
there's a hundred more to take my place.

809
01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:49.630
This is bigger than you. Murdock.
It's bigger than all of us.

810
01:31:49.730 --> 01:31:52.290
The Kingpin.

811
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.600
He runs the whole
goddamn town.

812
01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.700
You cross him. you're gonna end up
like Natchios...

813
01:31:57.810 --> 01:32:00.570
eighty-sixed by some maniac
like Bullseye--

814
01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.170
and he won't stop there.

815
01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.480
- What does that mean?
- Kingpin doesn't just kill you...

816
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:09.880
he kills your whole family.

817
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:29.230
<i>I have coffee.</i>

818
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.500
Did you get ahold
of Matt?

819
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.640
No. He'll call.
Don't worry.

820
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:39.350
- You should really get home. Karen.
- I'm fine.

821
01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:41.540
<i>- How are you doing?
- Oh. me? I'm great.</i>

822
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:44.250
I'm making ridiculously
little progress...

823
01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.850
for the amount of time
I've invested in this.

824
01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.050
Is your mom
coming to town?

825
01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.690
- My mom? No.
- What's that note?

826
01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:57.890
Oh. that? That's Matt's
big contribution to the Tazio case...

827
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.300
which has surprisingly turned out to be
completely useless.

828
01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:03.240
Mm.

829
01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.310
What's the date
of the murder?

830
01:33:07.410 --> 01:33:09.470
August 9th. Why?

831
01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:14.780
Maybe you're looking at it wrong?
August 9th.

832
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:28.570
''August 9th. WOW.''
WOW.

833
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:30.660
WOW. WOW. WOW.

834
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:33.130
WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW.

835
01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.640
Wesley Owen Welch.

836
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:39.270
Son of a bitch.

837
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.450
Oh. cha-ching.

838
01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.690
This better
be good. Kirby.

839
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.020
You know me. Urich.
It's always good.

840
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:12.470
Okay. Are you ready to see something
really. really cool?

841
01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:15.640
- Come on.
- Okay.

842
01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:19.140
<i>Ta-da.!</i>

843
01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:23.550
<i>Oh. come on. man.
I'm throwin'you gold.</i>

844
01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:26.280
<i>- Give me my money. I've seen it. Come on.
- Why?</i>

845
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:29.290
All right. Well.
but have you seen this?

846
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:39.500
And tighty-righty.
loosey-lefty.

847
01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:44.770
<i>You said look out
for anything weird.yes?</i>

848
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:49.770
<i>Well. it's some pretty
weird shit right here. man. right?</i>

849
01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.240
You have no idea.

850
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:04.850
- Yeah.
- Yeah. this is Franklin Nelson.

851
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.020
Uh. this is not
a good time.

852
01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:10.190
It's about Lisa Tazio.

853
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.640
Remember me?

854
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:11.840
No. Wait.

855
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:15.920
It wasn't me.

856
01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:19.980
It was a hit man
named Bullseye.

857
01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:25.550
- I didn't kill your father.
- Liar.

858
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.200
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Good. Then this will be quick.

859
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:38.630
I want to look into the eyes
of my father's killer as he dies.

860
01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.000
Wait. Wait.

861
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:49.340
Now you know.

862
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:54.980
- Oh. God.
- I was...just trying to protect you...

863
01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:57.140
um. Elektra.

864
01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:59.250
I'm sorry.

865
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:08.430
That's him. That's Bullseye.
Listen to me.

866
01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:10.630
- You have to run.
- He has to pay for what he's done.

867
01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:12.700
No. You have to--

868
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.700
I don't want
to lose you again.

869
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:19.030
- I'll find you.

870
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.750
<i>Come on. girl.!</i>

871
01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:44.960
<i>Hey. orphan. Let's play.</i>

872
01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.700
Nice. Come on.

873
01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:05.050
Ohh.

874
01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:10.660
Oh.

875
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:19.090
<i>You're good. baby.
I'll give you that.</i>

876
01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.160
But me?

877
01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:25.960
I'm magic.

878
01:42:51.090 --> 01:42:53.220
Now for my next trick.

879
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:59.630
No! No!

880
01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:24.460
<i>N. Y.P.D. Aviation.</i>

881
01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.830
<i>Do not move.! Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.</i>

882
01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:34.530
<i>I repeat. Get on your knees
and put your hands on your head.</i>

883
01:43:56.190 --> 01:43:58.160
Help me.

884
01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:03.230
Stay--
Stay with me.

885
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.000
Everything clear.

886
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.530
<i>Matthew. Matthew.</i>

887
01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:16.870
Oh. my God.
Oh. my God.

888
01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.680
This is my confession.
Father.

889
01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:27.010
God's mercy is infinite.
All ya gotta do is ask.

890
01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.280
Everything I had
has been taken from me.

891
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:33.550
Now I'm supposed to ask
for mercy.

892
01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:36.790
I don't ask for mercy--
people ask me.

893
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:38.990
Oh. is that a fact?

894
01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.500
First one's a warning...

895
01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:51.040
Padre.

896
01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:53.040
Is there a back door
out of here?

897
01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:55.130
<i>- Yeah.
- Take it. Call the police.</i>

898
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:57.510
What about you?

899
01:45:57.610 --> 01:46:01.020
- I have to finish this.
- But you can't fight like this. son.

900
01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.110
Have faith. Father.

901
01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:05.620
Isn't that right?

902
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:19.230
You. Let's play.

903
01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:02.460
Caine. I want the blueprints
and the city grids.

904
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:04.770
<i>- Secure the perimeter.
Where's my SWAT team?
- Yes. sir.</i>

905
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:07.500
- The doors are locked from the inside. sir.
- Break 'em down.

906
01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:10.040
It's a church. sir.

907
01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:13.270
- Your point?
- Yes. sir.

908
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:16.080
<i>- Let's get a battering ram in here now.
- You got it.</i>

909
01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.950
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

910
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:20.950
- Hey. Coyle. keep 'em in your sights.
- Which one?

911
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:25.080
- Both of'em! I want a man on that roof!.
- Ready?

912
01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.180
- Man without fear.

913
01:49:29.290 --> 01:49:33.130
<i>- Looks like I found
somethin'you're afraid of.</i>

914
01:49:33.230 --> 01:49:35.290
Let's bring on the pain.

915
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:40.540
Let's bring on the noise.

916
01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.220
Fisk was right about you.
He said you wouldn't go easy.

917
01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.810
Fisk?
Fisk is the Kingpin?

918
01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:04.260
Yeah.

919
01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.830
The whole red rose thing?
He loves that shite.

920
01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:09.060
<i>It's not my style.</i>

921
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:18.170
He hired me to kill Natchios.

922
01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.710
And to gut
your pretty girlfriend too.

923
01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.250
But me. I'm goin'
for the hat trick.

924
01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.820
<i>I told him
I'd do you for free.</i>

925
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:38.360
The Devil is mine.

926
01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:54.910
Oh. my hands!
My hands!

927
01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.450
<i>You took away my hands.</i>

928
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:05.080
Show mercy.

929
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.030
Whoa!

930
01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.410
Bull's-eye.

931
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:32.570
- Freeze!
- Whoa!

932
01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.780
Don't move!
Don't move!

933
01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.120
<i>- Stay on him.! Stay on him.! Stay on him.!
- Detective. look!</i>

934
01:51:44.690 --> 01:51:47.030
Good luck. son.

935
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.630
There's been a problem.

936
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:57.230
- Bullseye failed.
- Correct.

937
01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.970
Then he'll be coming here
next.

938
01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.510
- Why would you say that?
- Because that's what I would do.

939
01:52:03.610 --> 01:52:06.480
Well. then we'll
be ready for him. sir.

940
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:12.290
Send the guards home.

941
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:16.090
- B-But. sir--
- I was raised in the Bronx. Wesley.

942
01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:18.680
<i>This is something
you wouldn't understand.</i>

943
01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.220
Yes. sir.

944
01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:34.140
<i>- I have to talk to you.
- Give me a break. Urich.</i>

945
01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:37.340
<i>- Doors are open. Detective.
- Terrific. Just in time.</i>

946
01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:40.210
- Freddy. keep those people back!
- You're gonna wanna hear this.

947
01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.780
I just got an anonymous tip
on the Tazio murder.

948
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:45.550
Phone it into the station.
I got much bigger problems tonight.

949
01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.320
It leads to Wilson Fisk.

950
01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:50.980
Nick. he's the Kingpin
and I can prove it.

951
01:52:51.090 --> 01:52:53.560
Come on.
You got nothin' on Fisk.

952
01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:57.290
No. but I got the guy
that does.

953
01:52:59.770 --> 01:53:01.670
Would you care
for another martini. sir?

954
01:53:01.770 --> 01:53:04.830
No. I come here
for the view. asshole.

955
01:53:06.710 --> 01:53:09.740
- Wesley Owen Welch?
- Who wants to know?

956
01:53:09.850 --> 01:53:12.250
Detective Nick Manolis.

957
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:15.370
I'd like to talk to you
about the murder of Lisa Tazio.

958
01:53:15.490 --> 01:53:17.610
I want my lawyer.

959
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.950
I haven't charged you
with anything.

960
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.650
I won't talk to you
without my lawyer present.

961
01:53:24.090 --> 01:53:27.320
All right. then I'll talk.
you listen--

962
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:30.300
and then we can
talk about your plea bargain.

963
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:37.930
Check.

964
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:26.240
- Daredevil.

965
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.320
Kingpin.

966
01:55:32.490 --> 01:55:34.390
Mmm.

967
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:36.980
It's a shame
you came here wounded.

968
01:55:38.230 --> 01:55:41.250
I would have loved to
fight you in your prime.

969
01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:46.460
<i>They call you
the man without fear.</i>

970
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.340
If that's true. why are you afraid
to show your face?

971
01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:57.510
I don't believe it.

972
01:55:57.610 --> 01:56:00.170
No. No. No.

973
01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.010
The blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen?

974
01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:09.190
You killed the only two people
I ever loved.

975
01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:12.190
Why?

976
01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.800
Business.

977
01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:19.530
It's all it ever is.
is business.

978
01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.400
<i>I was working for Fallon
at the time.</i>

979
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:25.030
<i>Your father was supposed
to throw a fight.</i>

980
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:27.040
<i>And your girl...</i>

981
01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:32.100
<i>was in the wrong family
at the wrong time.</i>

982
01:56:32.210 --> 01:56:34.880
<i>It's all business.</i>

983
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.320
<i>I'll find you.</i>

984
01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:40.650
<i>And you've been in
my business for too long.</i>

985
01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:44.680
I've been thinking about this day
since I was 12 years old.

986
01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.640
I don't understand.

987
01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:23.420
I'm not the bad guy.

988
01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:28.160
- You hear that. blind man?

989
01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.430
Sirens.

990
01:58:31.530 --> 01:58:33.430
They're coming for you.

991
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:36.330
- For me?

992
01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:40.600
Didn't you hear?
The word's out on the Kingpin.

993
01:58:40.710 --> 01:58:44.870
<i>They're coming for you.
I can hear the police radios from here.</i>

994
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:49.920
No. No. I swear. I'll tell them
who you are.

995
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.990
<i>Yeah? Go ahead.</i>

996
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:57.550
Tell 'em. Tell the guys at Rikers
all about how you got beat by a blind man.

997
01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:01.620
It'll be like
blood in the water.

998
01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:06.830
Oh. Don't worry about that.
'Cause I'll get out.

999
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:08.900
Yeah. I know.

1000
01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:13.570
And I'll be waiting.

1001
01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.070
Justice is served.

1002
01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:28.960
I'll get you.

1003
01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:32.520
I'll get you.

1004
01:59:32.630 --> 01:59:36.360
It's not over with yet.

1005
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:40.030
<i>It's not over with yet.</i>

1006
01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:54.440
This is for you. Dad.

1007
02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.010
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Mr. Murdock.
I appreciate everything.

1008
02:00:20.110 --> 02:00:22.200
- Seriously. congratulations.
- You the man.

1009
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:24.610
All right. Yeah.
Keep it real.

1010
02:00:24.710 --> 02:00:26.680
I appreciate
everything.

1011
02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:30.720
I'm feelin' you. man.
You ever need anything.
come down to 1 1 7 th Street.

1012
02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:33.410
I'll do that.
Thank you.

1013
02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.220
- That's it. dog.
- You stuck by me.

1014
02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:36.490
- That's it. dog.
- You stuck by me.

1015
02:00:36.590 --> 02:00:40.320
Nobody wouldn't touch me
with a 20.000 foot pole.

1016
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:42.690
- Oh.
- All right.

1017
02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:46.430
<i>I could cry right now.
You're like a brother to me. man.</i>

1018
02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:49.270
''Police say that although
there were no eyewitnesses...

1019
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:52.140
they suspect Daredevil
was the one to bring Fisk to justice.''

1020
02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.940
Did you hear that?
There were no eyewitnesses.

1021
02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:56.840
It's in black and white.
How can you be a skeptic?

1022
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:59.780
If there's no eyewitness--
I mean. you know. Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

1023
02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.180
- Oh. please.
- The alligators in the sewers.

1024
02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.480
So you're saying there are
alligators in the sewers?

1025
02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:06.520
<i>- No.
- You're changing your position on this one.</i>

1026
02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:09.990
<i>Do you or do you not concede
that there are alligators in the sewers?</i>

1027
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:11.990
<i>- Please answer the question.</i>

1028
02:01:12.090 --> 02:01:15.830
<i>- No. I don't--
- How can you not concede? You won't--</i>

1029
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.530
<i>Judy. we're over here.!</i>

1030
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:30.280
How you doin'?

1031
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:35.210
- I'm doin' okay. I'll be all right.
- You want to talk about it?

1032
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.450
No. But thanks.

1033
02:01:42.090 --> 02:01:45.190
- I'm gonna get some air.
- I got it.

1034
02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:47.730
Thanks.

1035
02:02:05.110 --> 02:02:08.280
Good to see you.

1036
02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:10.610
Nice to see you.
Thank you very much.

1037
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:13.790
<i>Bueno. See you next week.</i>

1038
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:22.230
Well. maybe next week.
Matt. huh?

1039
02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:26.230
Maybe.

1040
02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:38.070
- Matt.
- Ben.

1041
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:43.480
Promised my kids I'd quit.
Gum's gonna kill me quicker.

1042
02:02:45.450 --> 02:02:48.220
- How are you?
- I'm all right. I'm good.

1043
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.320
<i>- Thank you.
- Well. don't thank me so quick.</i>

1044
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:56.870
You see there's this other
story I been workin' on.

1045
02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:59.490
I wanted to tell you about it
before it hit the paper.

1046
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.370
I know the truth
about Daredevil.

1047
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:06.870
Justice is blind.

1048
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:13.670
Ben.
if you run that story...

1049
02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:15.940
I'm finished.

1050
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:24.260
But I'm a reporter. kid.

1051
02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.060
It's what I do.

1052
02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.970
<i>Violence doesn't discriminate.</i>

1053
02:03:35.070 --> 02:03:38.010
<i>It hits all of us...</i>

1054
02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:44.280
<i>rich. poor. healthy. sick.</i>

1055
02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:50.150
<i>It comes as cold and bracing
as a winter breeze off the Hudson.</i>

1056
02:03:50.250 --> 02:03:53.420
<i>Until it sinks
into your bones...</i>

1057
02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.360
<i>leaving you with a chill
you can't shake.</i>

1058
02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:13.170
<i>- They say there's no rest for the wicked.</i>

1059
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:16.140
<i>But what about the good?</i>

1060
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:22.080
<i>The battle of good
versus evil is never-ending...</i>

1061
02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.190
<i>- because evil always survives...</i>

1062
02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:33.850
<i>- Bull's-eye.
- with the help of evil men.</i>

1063
02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:15.900
Braille.

1064
02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:48.830
<i>As for Daredevil. well...</i>

1065
02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:52.730
<i>soon the world
will know the truth--</i>

1066
02:05:58.910 --> 02:06:02.780
<i>that this is a city
born of heroes...</i>

1067
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:06.720
<i>that one man
can make a difference.</i>

1068
02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:27.670
Go get 'em. Matt.

1069
02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.340
<i>Hell's Kitchen is my neighborhood.</i>

1070
02:06:31.450 --> 02:06:34.810
<i>I prowl the rooftops
