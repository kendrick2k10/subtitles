00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.634
I'm here. Sorry. Mr. Taylor.

4
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.219
You were up 20 minutes ago.

5
00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:54.637
Why are you still here?
Just get out there.

6
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.514
-Okay.
-Hold on. hold on. Come back.

7
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.517
This is a pub.
Pubs love holidays.

8
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.394
Uh. no. December just started.

9
00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.396
Christmas starts the day
after Thanksgiving.
Just blame the Internet.

10
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.231
So. it's either these lights...

11
00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.233
or Janice's sweater.
You choose.

12
00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.071
Fine.

13
00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.531
Hey.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.824
-Lila.
-Stop.

15
00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:15.867
They're so colorful.

16

They're cute. Stop. Here.

17
00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.329
There you go.

18
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.832
You ready to do the thing?

19
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.626
-I was born ready.
-Okay. let's go.

20
00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:29.547
-Thank you. Lila.
-Got you. Mr. Taylor.

21
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.758
-Hurry up. Before he comes.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

22
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.843
Yeah. Excuse me.

23
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.768
Phone. Phone. Phone.

24
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.155
Hey. everyone.
Name's Gail Travers.

I'm from. well. everywhere.

27
00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.162
and this is "For the Crowd"
by Everly.

28
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.581
And thank you so much
for this opportunity.

29
00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.690
Requests only.

30
00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.859
All right. Okay. All right.

31
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:34.028
Um. anyone have
any requests for me?
Requests?

32
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.405
-Anyone?
-Hey.

33
00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.240
How about. uh. Pat Benatar?

34
00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.742
Oh! You got good taste.

35
00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.077
I think I got
something for you.

36
00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.653
Well. it was
worth a try. right?

37
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.948
Uh... five artists picked
to be opening acts

38
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.034
on iHeart Radio's
Christmas Eve Special...

39
00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:25.496
plus a spot on a tour
and a three-year contract?

40
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.290
Yes. It's worth it.

41
00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.792
And it would've looked
profesh on that stage.

42
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.086
but it will be just
as good from anywhere.

43
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.339
Because it's you.

44
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.049
You're the best.

45
00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.258
I hope you're right.

46
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.218
I'm always right.

47
00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.095
Will you please take these
off me? Take 'em off.

48
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.180
Okay.

49
00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.807
Okay.

50
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.352
Yes. They look
way better on you.

51
00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.519
'Tis the season.

52
00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.689
-Oh. here. Don't forget this.
-Oh. God.

53
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.651
-Thank you. All right.
I'll see you later.
-Bye.

54
00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.078
Tell me I'm good.

55
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.162
You're good.

56
00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:12.377

You are the real deal.
Gail Travers.

64
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.698
You should write
your own stuff.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.409
-Hmm.
-I bet it'd be wicked good.

66
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:09.786
I don't know.

67
00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.622
I don't think I can
write songs like that.

68
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.583
I've tried. I've tried...

69
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:19.420
but they just
never felt inspired.

70
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.506
Inspiration finds you.
you know?

71
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.884
You just have to let it happen.

72
00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.637
Wait. what are you doing?

73
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.014
-I'm editing it.
-You're taking out your ritual?

74
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.767
It's you.

75
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.352
Show them you.

76
00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.566

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.452
-Come on.
-Hey. If it doesn't happen...

81
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.664

And plus. right place.

88
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:13.141
and take a break from van life?

89
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.560
I could. but. you know...

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:29.725
-Are you hurt?
Are you hurt now?
-I'm fine.

178
00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.769
I just killed a llama.

179
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:34.063
It's an alpaca.

180
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.648
Did I kill him? It? Her?

181
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.733
-Okay. calm down.
-They? Do llamas have pronouns?

182
00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.527
Calm down. Here.
take some food.
Take some food.

183
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.487
No. no. no. I couldn't
possibly eat right now.

184
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.821
It's for Eddie.

185
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:46.659
This little guy.
he perks right up for a snack.

186
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.202
-Don't we all?

187
00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:50.746
All right. here.
I'll go check on him.

188
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:53.207
Oh. my God. Are you going
to drag him off the road
by its neck?

189
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.045
He's alive.
And he's up.

190
00:13:58.128 --> 00:13:59.797
-Come on. Eddie.
-Hi. Eddie.

191
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.340
You silly little rascal.

192
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:02.508
I didn't get your name.

193
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:03.759
Gail.

194
00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:05.052
Well. Gail. meet Eddie.

195
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:07.054
Well. you see.
you completely missed him

196
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:10.599
but this little guy just loved
playin' dead. Don't you?

197
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.768
Especially. when it's time
to saddle him up...

198
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:15.437
for the Christmas card photos
with the town folk.

199
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.440
Give him a hat
and he's good to go.

200
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.984
This gal here. though...

201
00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:21.902
she is not good to go.

202
00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:23.779
Where are you headed?

203
00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:26.615
Santa Fe and then LA.

204
00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.200
I don't think
I can get you that far.

205
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.453
but why don't I tow you
into my shop in town.

206
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.955
You're a lifesaver.

207
00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.165
Oh. it's the least I could do.
Now. do me a favor

208
00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:40.087
and you be nice to Gail now.
Eddie. okay? No spitting.

209
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.133
-Uh. I didn't catch your name.
-Oh. It's Savannah.

210
00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.802
But people around here.
they just call me Van.

211
00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.304
Oh.

212
00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.639
A woman named "Van"
is gonna fix my van.

213
00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.933
Where the hell am I?

214
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.769
Welcome to Harmony Springs.
Oklahoma.

215
00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.239
You think
I can hitch a ride

216
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.866
to the nearest Verizon store?

217
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:11.243
No Verizon
on the horizon here. darlin'.

218
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.829
Your best bet's gonna be
a gas station

219
00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.205
that sells walkie-talkies

220
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.708
and that would be about
50 miles that way.

221
00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:19.335
Can I borrow your phone?

222
00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.628
Absolutely.

223
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.921
Here you go.

224
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.009
Buttons all work.
just call who you like.

225
00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.178
I was gonna update my story.

226
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.138
-Your what?
-My story.

227
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.848
We all got a story. darlin'.

228
00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:36.018
-Hey. you play the guitar?
-Yeah.

229
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:39.063
No.

230
00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:40.648
No. no. no.

231
00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:43.859
No. It's broken.

232
00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:45.861
-Oh. I am so sorry.

233
00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:49.198
What am I gonna do?
This is bad. This is so bad.

234
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.741
-Oh!
-It ain't that bad.

235
00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:52.409
but it ain't good either.

236
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.535
This is Jeremy.

237
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.287
Best mechanic in Oklahoma.

238
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.206
also happens to be my son.

239
00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:58.582
Now.

240
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.419
I like her so I want you
to be optimistic. okay?

241
00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.630
How is she lookin'?

242
00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.715
If we cut deals
for everyone you like. Mom.

243
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:07.758
we'd run out of business.

244
00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:11.387
I mean. I can fix it...

245
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.680
but a vintage ride like this.

246
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.473
it's gonna take a minute
to get the parts.

247
00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:15.808
How long of a minute?

248
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.851
Um. two weeks.

249
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.228
-Two weeks? No. No.
-That's what I said.

250
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.063
And that's if
they get here on time.

251
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:24.400
Well. I mean. that puts us
just before Christmas.

252
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.360
so I can think of
no better gift

253
00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:28.320
than to have this beauty
running like new.

254
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.781
I have to report
to LA by the 24th.

255
00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:32.116
-LA?
-Yeah.

256
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:33.409
On Christmas Eve?
What's so important in LA?

257
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.077
iHeart Radio.

258
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.578
Fancy.

259
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.747
If you whip him again.
will he get more optimistic?

260
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.417
He's gonna try his hardest.
Aren't you. Jer?

261
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.752
How much is this gonna cost?

262
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.296
Well. with the bumper.
the axle.

263
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.216
obviously the body work.
you're looking at about...

264
00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:52.678
2.600 bucks. give or take.

265
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:55.305
-26...
-Yeah.

266
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.141
Oh. excuse me.

267
00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:00.853
-I got... Ooh. sorry.

268
00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:02.312
-My tools.
-Um...

269
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:05.566
I got $540.

270
00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:08.068
So. is that your checking
or your savings?

271
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.528
It's my everything.

272
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.988
Credit card?

273
00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:12.698
Yeah. as long as you have
a pair of scissors handy...

274
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:14.783
for when the bank
tells you to cut it up.

275
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:18.787
It's a start to cover
the parts.

276
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.748
Didn't you hear me?
This is all I have.

277
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:24.460
Okay. Well. hey. do you sing
with that guitar of yours?

278
00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.044
Yeah. I used to.

279
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:27.504
Take her to Gus's.

280
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:29.423
All right. we just added a show
to your schedule.

281
00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:31.049
And if you're lucky...

282
00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:33.719
it may just add a little bit
of cash to that bevy there.

283
00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:35.679
I have a lot of work
I gotta do.

284
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.347
Well. the shop is closing
early today.

285
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.474
Don't be rude.

286
00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:39.892
Go wash up. all right?

287
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:42.895
And show our new guest
here some hospitality.

288
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.609
All right. you comin'?

289
00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.246
Do you have a phone
I could borrow?

290
00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:11.340
Has anyone in this town
ever heard of a smartphone?

291
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.759
There ain't no use
for fancy around here.

292
00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:14.968
Clearly.

293
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.389
So. tonight's
Pass the Hat night.

294
00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:22.309
which means best performance
gets the pot.

295
00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:24.770
The pot's gonna be 2.000 bucks?

296
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.189
Yeah. no. Far from it.

297
00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.607
But it'll be a start.

298
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.422
Wow. This is some
serious karaoke.

299
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:54.842
Yeah. Uh. two mixed.

300
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.968
I'll have a shot.

301
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.053
A shot?

302
00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.346
Two shots.

303
00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.140
Yeah! Whoo!

304
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.065
Well. well.
Who do we have here?

305
00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.569
-Famous Gail Travers.

306
00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:14.695
Famous. huh?

307
00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:16.572
No. not famous.

308
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.407
Well. I'm Scarlet.

309
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.783
Is it too late to sign up?

310
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.244
I'm sure they could
squeeze you in...

311
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:25.622
but you gotta give
a little to win a little.

312
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:26.832
Oh. here. Let me.

313
00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:35.549
Let's see if Little Miss Famous
stands a chance.

314
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:39.595
All right. give it up for
everyone's favorite. Rachael!

315
00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:43.473
Always a killer.

316
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.058
Thank you.

317
00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.395
Oh. what's this?

318
00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:51.398
We have one more performer.
Her name is Gladys Travelers

319
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:54.943
Looks like we have
a last-minute performer
slidin' in

320
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.820
just in the nick of time.

321
00:19:56.904 --> 00:20:00.407
One Gladys Travelers.
come on down!

322
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.909
That's my cue.

323
00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.874
Gladys Travelers. come on!

324
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.086
-It's actually Gail Travers.

325
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.130
-Gail.
-All right. Gail.

326
00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:16.590
What song is it gonna be?

327
00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:18.091
Um...

328
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:20.594
Anyone wanna throw in
a little extra for a shuffle?

329
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.972
Did... Did she say "shuffle"?

330
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.933
Shuffle? Yeah?

331
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.809
Looks like we got a shuffle.

332
00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.561
All right. get
your last-minute money in

333
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.146
and let's spin the dial!

334
00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:35.025
Ooh. this is an oldie
but goodie.

335
00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:36.818
"Wayfaring Stranger."

336
00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.029
I actually
know that one really well.

337
00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:40.656
If it's good enough
for Johnny Cash.

338
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.115
it's good enough for me.

339
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:43.533
Amen.

340
00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.910
You mind if I play it myself?

341
00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:46.161
Knock yourself out.

342
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.259
Go. give it up
for Miss Gail!

343
00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.305
Get those votes in.

344
00:22:28.388 --> 00:22:32.017
so we can see who's gonna
take home the cash!

345
00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.564
Where did that come from?

346
00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:39.107
I just got lucky with the song.

347
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.151
Where did you say
she came from again?

348
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.446
Um. ah. she. uh...

349
00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.782
-Her car broke down
just outside of town.
-Oh.

350
00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.450
She missed. uh...
She missed Eddie by an inch.

351
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:51.995
I swear that creature
has nine lives.

352
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.873
How lucky are we?

353
00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.000
Where you headed?
Home for Christmas?

354
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.418
Not quite.

355
00:22:58.502 --> 00:22:59.628
The votes are in.

356
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.797
and the winner is...

357
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.925

Go. darlin'! Whoo!

359
00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:08.512
Travers.

360
00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:09.930
It's Travers. Thank you.

361
00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:12.140
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

362
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.142
Ah. here you go.

363
00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.311
Gotta be honest with you.
I never thought
I'd see that back.

364
00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:19.689
You know. actually.
take the whole thing.
Put it towards the repairs.

365
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.900
Look at you. winning.

366
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:25.487
You know what? I'm...

367
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.449
I'm actually gonna get going.
It's been a really long day.

368
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:32.369
Bye.

369
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:38.333
She's a little stuck-up.
isn't she?

370
00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:42.420
Where are you going?

371
00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:46.258
She's got nowhere to go.

372
00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:48.635
So?

373
00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:58.687
Hey.

374
00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.771
Where ya headed?

375
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.648
Home.

376
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:02.816
What. to that old bus?

377
00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:05.861
Yes. that old bus.

378
00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:08.280
Well. you know the shop
doors are locked. right?

379
00:24:08.363 --> 00:24:09.698
Oh.

380
00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:12.576
If only I knew someone
with the keys.

381
00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:14.953
Come on. I'll drive you.

382
00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.038
Your girlfriend gonna
come after me for this?

383
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.874
Nah. I ain't got a girlfriend.

384
00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.711
Come on. It's freezing.

385
00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:04.711
Original song. huh?

386
00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:07.505
About what?

387
00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:39.913
No.

388
00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.583
-No. no. no.

389
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:28.586
Really?

390
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:31.673
God! What?

391
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.883
You let her sleep in the bus?

392
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.386
Well. you know. she was pretty
insistent about it. Mom.

393
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.472
Here.

394
00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.224
Thanks.

395
00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:42.392
Yeah.

396
00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.311
Okay.

397
00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:47.689
This has a license plate.

398
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.316
not a street address. okay?

399
00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:52.068
No more sleeping in a vehicle
that is under maintenance.

400
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:54.279
Insurance won't cover it.

401
00:26:57.032 --> 00:27:00.869
Sorry about that.
Here. Take this.

402
00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:03.079
And you just. I don't know.
add it to your collection.

403
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:04.497
Thanks.

404
00:27:11.254 --> 00:27:12.797
Sheriff?

405
00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:15.300
Yeah. Sheriff Jeffrey's out of
town for the next two weeks...

406
00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:16.885
a little hunting trip.

407
00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.219
so a man's gotta
wear a lot of hats.

408
00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.555
Hmm. Oh. you mean jackets?

409
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:24.893
-Look. I got a plan.
-Well. here's my plan.

410
00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:26.644
Uh. you know what.
you go first.

411
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.147
-Tell me your plan.
-I get a job
while you fix the bus.

412
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.608
When you're done. I'll have
two grand and be on my way.

413
00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:33.777
So. what do you got in a town
like this? Diner?

414
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.861
Post office?

415
00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:36.446
Phone operators?

416
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:39.824
You know that minimum wage
around here is $7.25 an hour?

417
00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:44.412
That's gonna be
probably around 300 hours
over the next two weeks.

418
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:47.749
Okay. So.
what's your awesome plan then?

419
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.548
Very festive.

420
00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.844
A middle school?

421
00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:02.597
What. am I dealing pot?

422
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.891
What kind of middle school
did you go to?

423
00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:10.939
It smells like sneakers
and fruit snacks.

424
00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:14.150
You better start talking. Oh!

425
00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:16.444
Jeremy.
where have you been?

426
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:18.279
The twins. they're recruiting

427
00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.281
for their new rap song
music video.

428
00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:21.741
Sarah. slow down.

429
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:23.576
And since when are there
oboe players in a rap song?

430
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.620
-And then...
And then they were--
-Hey.

431
00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.288
-Why were they...
No. but they were--
-Hey. hey. hey. Whoa. whoa.

432
00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:30.125
Look at me. Look at me.
My eyes. My eyes. okay?

433
00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.876
-Okay? Good.

434
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.088
Do as I do. Follow me.

435
00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.102
Better?

436
00:28:51.104 --> 00:28:52.647
Oh!

437
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.274
Are you the new music teacher?

438
00:28:54.357 --> 00:28:55.525
-No.
-Yeah.

439
00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:57.986
What?

440
00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:19.966
I'd like you to meet
our new music teacher. Miss...

441
00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:22.343
I think you are all mistaken.

442
00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.679
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Principal Crosby.

443
00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:27.515
Heard of your performance
last night at Gus's Bar.

444
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.517
Seems you're qualified
for the job.

445
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:32.395
Jeremy here will be
more than willing to step down.

446
00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:34.063
Am I right?

447
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:36.232
You didn't think I came up with
this out of thin air. did you?

448
00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:39.360
I've been trying to teach these
kids for the last two weeks.

449
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.696
I can't imagine
how that's going.

450
00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:43.114
What happened
to the last teacher?

451
00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:45.408
Teachers.
Everyone in town's tried.

452
00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:48.369
Jeremy was our last resort.

453
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:51.456
Look. the performance for the
Christmas Gala is in two weeks.

454
00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.876
And this is a jacket
that I'd happily hand over.

455
00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:58.213
Does it look like I know
the first thing about
Christmas? Or galas?

456
00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:00.465
Jeremy has informed me
of your situation.

457
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:02.133
You prep these kids

458
00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:03.885
and I'll cover the bus repairs.

459
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.303
And if the kids win.

460
00:30:05.386 --> 00:30:07.222
perhaps you will leave
Harmony Springs

461
00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.390
with three percent
of the cash prize.

462
00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:10.850
You can win a gala?

463
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:12.936
Each school selects
teams to compete.

464
00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.522
There's cash prizes. prestige.

465
00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:18.107
Do we have a deal?

466
00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.362
All expenses paid.

467
00:30:22.445 --> 00:30:24.239
that engine purrs
like a kitten.

468
00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:27.075
and I make it to LA on time.

469
00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.451
Yes. yes. and yes.

470
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.999
Well. let's meet these kids.

471
00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:38.002
Thank you.

472
00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.712
Write your name
on the chalk board.

473
00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:41.839
I'm going to give you apples
every day.

474
00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:44.509
If teachers were apples.
I'd pick you.

475
00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:47.512
Jeremy. A word.

476
00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:50.890
After the gala. we have
to shut the music program down.

477
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:53.017
What the hell are you
talking about. Stanley?

478
00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.478
I'm sorry. son.

479
00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:59.148
We just simply can't
keep the program going.

480
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:02.819
So. uh. you're just gonna
do this without talkin'
to my family first?

481
00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:04.737
Or me?

482
00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:06.656
I'm sorry.

483
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.247
Chalk board.

484
00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:31.514
My name is Ms. Travers.

485
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:33.850
and I'm gonna be
helping you get ready

486
00:31:33.933 --> 00:31:37.562
for the Christmas Eve Gala
in two weeks.

487
00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:40.815
So. let's see what
we're workin' with here.

488
00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:42.483
Let's go around the room

489
00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.110
and tell me your name...

490
00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:47.196
Name. musical interest. and
favorite Christmas tradition.

491
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.198
I'll start. I'm Sarah Hughes.

492
00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:51.034
I wanna be an opera singer.

493
00:31:51.117 --> 00:31:54.537
I like leaving food out
for Santa's reindeer
on Christmas Eve.

494
00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:57.290
Sarah. Opera. Reindeer. Noted.

495
00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:58.416
You and you.

496
00:31:58.499 --> 00:32:00.209
We're Jeff and Johnny.
I'm Jeff.

497
00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:01.836
I'm Johnny.

498
00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:05.632
We rap. Hoping to one day rock
Harmony Springs with our flow.

499
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:19.228
Nice.

500
00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:20.897
And we set traps in our chimney
to see if we can catch a Santa.

501
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.024
-Oh.
-We've never caught one.

502
00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:24.817
-Oh. no.
-Dear God.

503
00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:26.319
There's only one Santa

504
00:32:26.402 --> 00:32:28.863
and Santa doesn't actually
rhyme with Montana.

505
00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.406
Just to let you know.

506
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.033
Benjamin still wets the bed.

507
00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:34.744
Hey. Okay. okay. no making fun
of one another. okay?

508
00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:36.579
That's rule number one.

509
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:38.414
We have to support each other.

510
00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:41.167
Your turn.

511
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.710
I'm Benjamin Donovan.

512
00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.545
I like to wear matching pj's
with my mom and dad...

513
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.547
while we decorate the Christmas
tree. and I can play the oboe.

514
00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:48.966
Sort of.

515
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.594
Do you all have to play
instruments for this thing?

516
00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:53.137
We don't have to.

517
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:55.348
Okay. good. 'Cause I'm not
a real music teacher.

518
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.393
Mm. we're not really
music students.

519
00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:01.354
So. what are your
musical skills then?

520
00:33:01.437 --> 00:33:04.565
And your favorite
Christmas tradition.

521
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:08.361
Well. uh. I don't have
any Christmas traditions.

522
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:10.154
Why not?

523
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:14.534
I guess I never stuck around
long enough in one place
to make one.

524
00:33:14.617 --> 00:33:15.702
Why not?

525
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:19.997
Long story.

526
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:23.376
How about I show you
my musical skills?

527
00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:52.363
Wow.

528
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:56.284
If we sing like that.
we'll win.

529
00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.454
-See ya.
-See ya.

530
00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.831
-Bye.
-Bye.

531
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:03.291
She's so good.

532
00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:05.835
-I know. right?
-She's great!

533
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:17.972
Ooh!

534
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.224
Were you hiding back there
the whole time?

535
00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:24.812
Sorry. I'm scared of strangers
and loud noises.

536
00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.939
But you have a great voice.

537
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.485
Thank you. What's your name?

538
00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.821
Rosemary.

539
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.740
Nice to meet you. Rosemary.

540
00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.868
I sing to my animals.

541
00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:40.995
That's my skill.

542
00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:44.624
but my mom thinks
I need to be around
more humans.

543
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:48.002
Yeah. humans.

544
00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:50.379
Well. I'm very excited
to hear you sing.

545
00:34:54.967 --> 00:34:56.844
Did you sing in all the places?

546
00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:59.138
What?

547
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.015
All the places
you never stuck around

548
00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:03.142
long enough to make traditions.

549
00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:05.603
I did.

550
00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.607
Maybe that's your
Christmas tradition.

551
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:10.858
Singing.

552
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:15.988
Everyone has one.
even if they don't know it.

553
00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.710
One day.

554
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.338
Hey. Mom. Dad.

555
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:35.383
Hey. buddy. I saw you got
the beams up. Looks great.

556
00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.510
-Oh. it's wonderful. Abe.

557
00:35:37.593 --> 00:35:39.971
Yeah. you can really see the
rooms starting to take shape.

558
00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:43.182
So. you know they're shutting
down the music program?

559
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:46.519
Oh. honey. Yeah. Stanley
warned us it might happen.

560
00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:50.398
I just wanted to wait
until he was sure
before I said anything.

561
00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:52.108
This meant
everything to Parker.

562
00:35:52.191 --> 00:35:54.735
I know. but there were. like.
what. four kids in the class?

563
00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.529
-There's five.
-Five.

564
00:35:57.738 --> 00:35:59.866
Five is not enough
to justify the cost.

565
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:02.076
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. son.

566
00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:04.412
But how did Gail do?

567
00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.747
She's got a way of
making things better. I guess.

568
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.083
What's this now?

569
00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:12.295
Jeremy got the girl
with the bus to teach the kids.

570
00:36:12.378 --> 00:36:14.255
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

571
00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:15.423
Gail. huh?

572
00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:16.757
Like the wind.

573
00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:19.677
Gail this. Gail that.

574
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.512
She's been here
all of 12 hours.

575
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.764
Can y'all talk about
anything else?

576
00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:25.474
Hey there. Scarlet.

577
00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:29.353
How's the build comin'?

578
00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:30.646
It's fine.

579
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.610
Uh. we were...
We were just discussing that.

580
00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.321
We were talking about
how well it's coming along...

581
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:40.823
-and what a great view.
-Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:42.408
That's great. Van.

583
00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:44.619
Blueberry peach.

584
00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.704
Just how you guys like it.

585
00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:48.289
Thank you. Scarlet.

586
00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:50.666
Thank you. Scarlet.

587
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.477
Livin' the dream.

588
00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:25.159
Wow.

589
00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:28.829
Thought I'd sneak by and get
away with spending a few more
nights in there.

590
00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:30.331
-Guess not.
-Mm-mm.

591
00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.874
What are you doing
with my stuff?

592
00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:33.417
Uh. I just put it in the box.

593
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.544
You can't stay in there
no more. unfortunately.

594
00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:40.091
but my parents. they own
a studio a couple blocks away.
You could stay there.

595
00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:42.843
I mean. there's a bunch
of stuff layin' around.

596
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.845
Haven't had time
to fix it up to rent it out.

597
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.515
but it's got four walls
and a roof.

598
00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:52.019
Ah... You'll be okay. old girl.

599
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.854
She better be in good hands.

600
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.064
She's in great hands.

601
00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.777
My bus. I call her Jewel.

602
00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.030
She's the only home
I've ever known.

603
00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:06.158
Well. she is a gem.

604
00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:08.286
I'm glad someone
agrees with me.

605
00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:12.373
What happened?

606
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.874
Splinter.

607
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.876
My tip box. it...

608
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.628
-Yeah.
-Tip box?

609
00:38:18.838 --> 00:38:21.590
Someone really special
gave it to me.

610
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:23.509
I take it to all my gigs.

611
00:38:23.592 --> 00:38:25.761
but it broke in the crash.

612
00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.015
Sorry.

613
00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.979
Speakin' of sorries.
I owe you one.

614
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.774
I was pretty mean the other day
when you came in there.

615
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:42.653
Any mention of big cities
makes my skin crawl.

616
00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.073
So. sorry.

617
00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:49.660
Apology accepted.

618
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.287
You weren't that bad.

619
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.080
I was pretty bad.

620
00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.874
So. let me make it up to ya.

621
00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:58.127
Take you to dinner now.
and go look
at the studio later?

622
00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:02.673
You know a way
to a girl's heart.
I'm starving.

623
00:39:10.306 --> 00:39:11.932
Smells good.

624
00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.143
Okay.

625
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.523
Oh!

626
00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:20.858
Of course.

627
00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:22.443
It's you! Well...

628
00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:25.196
Okay. my sons
Johnny and Jeff...

629
00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:27.990
they told me all about
their new music teacher.

630
00:39:28.074 --> 00:39:29.617
They said.
"She's not a real teacher.

631
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.744
but she can sing and play piano
just like Beyonce."

632
00:39:31.827 --> 00:39:34.121
And I said.
"Does Beyonce play piano?"

633
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:37.083
And they said.
"If she did. she'd play just
like Miss Gail."

634
00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.709
And then I said to myself.

635
00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:42.046
"How do I know that name?
Why do I know that name?"

636
00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:44.215
And now I get it.

637
00:39:44.298 --> 00:39:46.300
Let me get you a table.

638
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:48.260
Bruce! Get the sauce
by the door.

639
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:50.346
Come on. honey.
This way. we're goin' right
to this table right here.

640
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:51.806
Hey. Did you hear
she almost hit Eddie?

641
00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:52.973
What? Eddie?

642
00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.892
-No!
-Yeah. right here.

643
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.560
You happened to Eddie?

644
00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:59.230
-Guilty. Guilty.
-No. It's okay. darlin'.

645
00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:02.650
Listen. that alpaca
is like half deer. I swear.

646
00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.860
Something comes at it.
it just like...

647
00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:11.325
Deer in headlights.

648
00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:17.998
-Whoo!

649
00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.500
I'm just messing with you.
darlin'.

650
00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:20.918
Wow.

651
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.504
So. where you headin'
once your bus is done?

652
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:26.674
-I have a gig in LA.
-Oh!

653
00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:29.969
And if it all goes well.
I'll tour all over the world.

654
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.347
She'd be on her way
to being a big deal.

655
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:37.017
Well. that's a huge deal.
With who?

656
00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.311
They'll pair us
with the right fit. you know.

657
00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:41.021
It's a good thing
I'm used to living on the road.

658
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.442
Well. listen. I am gonna
get you the Lumberjack platter.

659
00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:45.901
You know. just a little bit
of everything.

660
00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:48.195
No. no. no.
Come on now. that feeds six.

661
00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:51.240
You can take some home.

662
00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:53.784
Lumberjack platter?
What is that?

663
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.578
It's just a whole lot of food.

664
00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:57.746
Plus. it'll make a great photo
for your Instagram.

665
00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.748
I'm surprised
you even know what that is.

666
00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.625
I ain't livin' in a hole here.

667
00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:03.836
I gave it up.

668
00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:05.838
I gave up all my social media.

669
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:07.464
Color me intrigued.

670
00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:09.508
Sometimes when things aren't
working. you unplug for a bit

671
00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:11.385
-before you plug back in.
-Hmm.

672
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.721
Life's no different.

673
00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:17.433
I haven't been this unplugged
since I was eight.

674
00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:19.935
Well. here we go.

675
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:22.980
-Oh. boy.
-Two Oklahoma
extra oma palomas.

676
00:41:23.063 --> 00:41:25.983
Now. you tell your friends
in LA about that.

677
00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:27.151
Wow.

678
00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:32.907
To LA.

679
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.909
Oh. so now
you're pro big cities?

680
00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:37.411
Can't make it big
without a big city. right?

681
00:41:38.954 --> 00:41:40.164
Cheers.

682
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:41.373
Cheers.

683
00:41:42.124 --> 00:41:43.250
Thanks.

684
00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:57.556
So. just so you know.
I wasn't lying.

685
00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.558
-It's pretty messy in here.

686
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:05.689
Now. I know it's not much.

687
00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.275
but it's warm.

688
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.861
And bathroom's
back there. so...

689
00:42:10.945 --> 00:42:14.615
If Rachael's barbeque wasn't
so good. I'd be outta here.

690
00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:18.535
Um. I know there's
some fresh sheets
in one of these boxes...

691
00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:19.954
No. no. no. Not this one.

692
00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:24.917
-This one?
-Yeah. I believe so.

693
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.418
I mean.
I know there used to be.

694
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:30.506
Here you go. Oh.

695
00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.178
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

696
00:42:36.262 --> 00:42:37.471
Uh...

697
00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:38.806
Forgot to ask you.

698
00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:41.392
uh. what song
were you teaching the kids?

699
00:42:42.476 --> 00:42:44.228
Uh. never got that far.

700
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:46.689
This being our last song.
I don't know.
pick something special.

701
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.816
Hmm.

702
00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.360
Sounds like you miss it.

703
00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:53.904
Kinda.
Even if the kids are awful.

704
00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.990
Hey. They are not awful.

705
00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.283
They're just...

706
00:42:58.033 --> 00:42:59.201
unpolished.

707
00:43:01.328 --> 00:43:04.999
Well. uh. the kids...

708
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.250
they're the heart of this town.

709
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:08.210
And the word is they
really love you.

710
00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:12.840
That reminds me. um.
Stanley called.

711
00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:16.218
so I guess your class
starts at 8:00 a.m.

712
00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:17.970
I thought this was
an after-school thing?

713
00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:21.181
Mm-mm. Christmas break.
Next two weeks.

714
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.642
-So. good luck.
-Hmm...

715
00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.774
8:00 a.m.

716
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:33.027
When am I gonna write my song?

717
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.240
Miss Travers? Ew!

718
00:43:38.324 --> 00:43:42.161
Uh. sorry. I'm just bringin' in
the rest of your stuff.

719
00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:45.456
This. uh...

720
00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:46.832
This good here?

721
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.753
-Great.
-Cool. Um...

722
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:52.755
Yeah. Good night.

723
00:43:52.838 --> 00:43:53.881
Good night.

724
00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:12.316
Something smells really good.

725
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.993
-Well. good mornin'.
-Good mornin'.

726
00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:25.412
About time y'all woke up.

727
00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.623
-What do we have here?
-It smells so good.

728
00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:29.750
I know. I was trying
to be quiet.

729
00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:34.338
-Look at that.
-Wow.

730
00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:36.256
Whoa.

731
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.093
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

732
00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:42.805
Are these your famous
Jeremy flapjacks?

733
00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:44.640
Yes. they are.

734
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:46.016
-Boy.
-Here you go. Mom.

735
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.268
'Cause you know
first one's always yours.

736
00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.770
I have missed this.

737
00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.313
Thank you.

738
00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.357
Look at him.

739
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.127
-Ooh.

740
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.546
Everything okay?

741
00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:18.966
Uh. I have to write
my very own song.

742
00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:23.262
A song good enough to impress
some of the best music people
out there.

743
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:24.346
So.

744
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.515
it has to be perfect.

745
00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:29.184
The animals on our farm
are messy.

746
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:33.564
Pretty imperfect. but I still
think they're beautiful.

747
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:37.609
Cracks happen in our lives just
to let the light in. You know?

748
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:41.155
You give the best advice.

749
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:48.620
What would you say to someone
who has a beautiful voice.

750
00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:51.373
but they're scared
of showing it off?

751
00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.668
I'm getting
the first cubbyhole.

752
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:58.338
The first book... Yeah. I know.
but I just don't like...

753
00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.756
It's time to get focused.

754
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.633
Focusing.

755
00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:06.346
Today we're gonna focus
on the instrument
we already have. Our voice.

756
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.473
All right?

757
00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:09.933
Everyone. get up.
Stand up. Get up.

758
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:13.770
Close your eyes.
Close 'em. Close 'em.

759
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:17.107
Now. place your hands
over your heart.

760
00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:19.401
Breathe in.

761
00:46:20.652 --> 00:46:21.612
Breathe out.

762
00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:26.408
This is where you sing from.

763
00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:29.161
Not your head or your lungs.

764
00:46:29.244 --> 00:46:30.496
Your heart.

765
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.373
Now. set an intention.

766
00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.751
How do you wanna
feel when you sing?

767
00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:38.921
Now. stretch your arms
out in front of you...

768
00:46:39.004 --> 00:46:41.173
and release it out
into the universe.

769
00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:44.176
I feel it.

770
00:46:44.259 --> 00:46:47.471
Someone's intention
smells like a fart.

771
00:46:47.554 --> 00:46:50.140
Release your intentions
through your mouths.

772
00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:51.266
Not our butts?

773
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.519
Come on. Keep your focus!

774
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:54.978
Thank you. Sarah.

775
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:58.899
Okay. today we're gonna try
singing a simple A note.

776
00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:02.110
One at a time.
Just like this. okay?

777
00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:13.747
That was great.

778
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.707
All right.

779
00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:19.670
Believe it or not.
an A can sound different
for someone with a lower voice.

780
00:47:19.753 --> 00:47:21.004
Like Benjamin.

781
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:23.549
Johnny and Jeff. your turn.
Let's hear it.

782
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.138
Okay.

783
00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:32.849
Playing to your strengths.
I love it. Love it.

784
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.601
Rosemary. your turn.

785
00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.103
Just an A note.

786
00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:37.479
Easy-peasy.

787
00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:42.150
Mm-hmm. Okay.
I think I can hear it.

788
00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:44.820
You just need to get
a little louder.

789
00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:52.119
That was beautiful.

790
00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:54.288
You just gotta
get it a little louder.

791
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.665
Don't worry. You're not gonna
scare anyone away.

792
00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.377
All right. Miss Opera singer.
let's hear it.

793
00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.262
Wow. Wow.

794
00:48:10.345 --> 00:48:12.347
Okay. Okay. Shh. shh.

795
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:14.975
We are gonna work on that.

796
00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.728
All right. I have to write
my very own song

797
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:19.646
for a big show I have coming up

798
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.398
and I'm having a hard time.

799
00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:26.028
What if we all write
a Christmas song together
for the gala?

800
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:27.321
I could use the practice.

801
00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:30.115
Do we have
enough time for that?

802
00:48:30.198 --> 00:48:33.160
Well. it doesn't have
to be perfect.

803
00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.412
-It just has to be ours.

804
00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:36.622
-See ya.
-Bye.

805
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.665
Great job today.

806
00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:40.375
-Bye.
-Bye.

807
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:41.918
Hey. Sarah.

808
00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:43.045
Everything okay?

809
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.465
I know I can't sing.

810
00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:48.550
I've been trying

811
00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:51.345
and I know I act like I'm good

812
00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:54.765
but it's just pretend
and I'm not good
at anything at all.

813
00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:55.849
Hey.

814
00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.517
Sarah. that's not true.

815
00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.936
I bet you're good
at a lot of things.

816
00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:06.860
You know what?
I'm gonna be gone for the show.

817
00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:10.322
I'm gonna need someone to be
in charge while I'm away.

818
00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:14.326
I think you would be
really good at that.

819
00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:15.369
At what?

820
00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:17.371
Making things happen.

821
00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:18.747
We need lights.

822
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.333
stage direction.
every detail of the performance

823
00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:22.876
needs to be organized.

824
00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.795
That's what
a stage manager does.

825
00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:25.921
Stage manager?

826
00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:28.006
Mm-hmm. The best operas.

827
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.843
they're run by
the best stage managers
in the world.

828
00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:33.971
We're gonna need
someone really good

829
00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:35.472
to be the boss.

830
00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.686
-Then call me "boss." boss.
-Give me some.

831
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.979
-Bye.
-Bye.

832
00:49:46.608 --> 00:49:48.819
Oh.

833
00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:52.739
Well. I can see
why he likes you so much.

834
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:53.824
Who?

835
00:49:53.907 --> 00:49:56.910
Oh. you know exactly who.

836
00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.578
What about Scarlet?

837
00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:01.415
Let's just say
it takes two to agree
to be a couple.

838
00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.749
not just one.

839
00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.418
Girl's been after him
since grade school.

840
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.838
Oh! Oh. how much longer
do we have you?

841
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:09.506
You know what?

842
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:10.674
I don't wanna know.

843
00:50:10.757 --> 00:50:12.467
You want some cake?

844
00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:14.469
Bruce! Get the cake!

845
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.651
Come in.

846
00:50:31.945 --> 00:50:33.572
-Hey.
-Hi.

847
00:50:33.655 --> 00:50:35.782
I. uh...

848
00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.451
You never came in
to check on Jewel today.

849
00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.453
so I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

850
00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.663
Mm-hmm. I'm working on
some lyrics.

851
00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:44.166
I have two songs to write now.

852
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:46.835
Oh. you're...
You're doin' an original song.

853
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:48.086
Mm-hmm.

854
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.381
The. um. last teacher
we had do that...

855
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:55.969
uh. kids really loved it. so...

856
00:50:58.388 --> 00:50:59.639
Um...

857
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.349
Got you something.

858
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:03.518
Ooh.

859
00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:04.811
An empty box.

860
00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.021
It's a send-back box.

861
00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:08.690
You put your broken
phone inside

862
00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:11.443
and they you send it out
and they mail you
a brand-new one.

863
00:51:11.526 --> 00:51:13.987
Actually. you know what?
I can mail it out for you
tonight if you want.

864
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.489
You got the phone?

865
00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:16.990
You know. I don't even know

866
00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:20.494
where my phone is right now.
if you can believe that.

867
00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.412
Oh. here it is.

868
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:24.289
Perfect.

869
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:30.921
I'll let you get back to it.

870
00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:33.006
Yeah. Um...

871
00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:37.511
You know. actually
if you get a break
or something.

872
00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:39.012
you know.
later on if you're hungry.

873
00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:40.680
I know a great place
for dinner.

874
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:44.768
Yes. Yes. I could eat that
barbeque sandwich every meal.

875
00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:47.813
No. I was actually thinking
of something a little more
close to home.

876
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.065
Hmm.

877
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.067
Okay.

878
00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:55.111
Cool.

879
00:51:55.195 --> 00:51:56.780
I'll. uh. see you later.

880
00:51:56.863 --> 00:51:57.864
See you later.

881
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:12.128
This was so good.

882
00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:14.840
Girl could stick around
for this kinda cooking.

883
00:52:17.342 --> 00:52:19.803
So. you live here?

884
00:52:19.886 --> 00:52:24.057
For now. It's just easier
while I build it
for my parents.

885
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.727
This could be
the sweetest thing
you could do for someone.

886
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:33.066
These walls you've created
will hold your family's
most precious moments.

887
00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:38.613
Never really thought
about it like that.

888
00:52:38.697 --> 00:52:40.574
You should tell me
about your family.

889
00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:44.953
I. uh...

890
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.332
I never knew my parents.

891
00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:53.003
I never had a house.

892
00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:54.796
I was a foster kid.

893
00:52:56.214 --> 00:53:00.719
I grew up in the system
from the day I was born.

894
00:53:00.802 --> 00:53:03.638
Run of bad luck got me
bounced around several times

895
00:53:03.722 --> 00:53:05.765
until I hit 18.

896
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.936
I had my guitar. my music...

897
00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:12.188
that was my home.

898
00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:14.941
Sorry.

899
00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.068
It wasn't all that bad.

900
00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:19.613
I had this one foster dad

901
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:22.115
who taught me
how to ground myself

902
00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:24.618
before I sing. you know.

903
00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.412
Use the nervous butterflies
to find my voice.

904
00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.125
Did he create the tip box?

905
00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:34.794
-Yes. he did.
-Figured.

906
00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.588
Where is he?

907
00:53:36.671 --> 00:53:38.423
He moved to Canada...

908
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:43.595
without me. um.
for a business opportunity.

909
00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:47.223
Foster kids
can't leave the country.

910
00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:49.809
and we lost touch.

911
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.813
That's the system for you.

912
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.400
But what about you?

913
00:53:57.484 --> 00:54:00.070
Childhood out here
must've been pretty great.

914
00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.780
Yeah.

915
00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:04.741
I mean. look.

916
00:54:04.824 --> 00:54:06.534
Yeah. we had the biggest house
up on a hill. you know.

917
00:54:06.618 --> 00:54:09.621
Nothing but green for miles.
It was great.

918
00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.833
But we couldn't stay.

919
00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:17.671
Not after my brother died.

920
00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:25.512
But this. it's the least I can
do for taking him away.

921
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.392
Taking him away?

922
00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:32.602
He was the star
of the music program.

923
00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:37.899
Yeah. I mean.
he actually started it.

924
00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:40.485
His voice was so good. Gail.

925
00:54:40.568 --> 00:54:41.695
Like yours.

926
00:54:44.155 --> 00:54:46.992
You know. which is why
I pushed him so hard.

927
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.996
I had this plan.

928
00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:55.208
You know. go out to LA
so he can chase his dream.

929
00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.711
I mean. I just got
so caught up in it all.

930
00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.671
Became so self-centered.

931
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.048
And what happened?

932
00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.675
We were at a party...

933
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:08.054
and it was getting late.

934
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.889
He had a gig
the next day. early.

935
00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.766
and he was exhausted.

936
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.811
so I just threw him the keys.

937
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:20.442
And. uh. he...

938
00:55:22.027 --> 00:55:24.654
probably fell asleep
at the wheel.

939
00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:27.157
Hit a curb. lost control.
and that was it.

940
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.993
Last time I saw my brother.

941
00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.329
I'm so sorry. Jeremy.

942
00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.625
So. you went home.

943
00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:41.254
and put on all your jackets?

944
00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:46.009
What I'm doing is trying
to fill the hole
that he left behind.

945
00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:47.886
Parker was everything
to Harmony Springs.

946
00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:49.721
Well. you can't blame yourself.

947
00:55:51.639 --> 00:55:55.060
The reason why I stayed
is because Coldplay
was gonna be there.

948
00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:00.148
And I just wanted
to take a picture with them

949
00:56:00.231 --> 00:56:02.942
to impress some girl
that I didn't even know.

950
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:07.280
Because of it.

951
00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:09.866
we never got to see my brother
again over some stupid post.

952
00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:14.871
Yeah. now. um...

953
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.916
Now. I get
the whole smartphone thing.

954
00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.168
Hmmm.

955
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.253
I know what
you must think of me.

956
00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:26.633
Desperate to update my story

957
00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:29.844
for a whole bunch of people
I've never even met.

958
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:31.304
No.

959
00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:34.891
I mean. it's a priority
for your career. I get it.

960
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.185
Hmm.

961
00:56:37.268 --> 00:56:39.020
I'll tell you what. though.

962
00:56:41.272 --> 00:56:43.858
I like the unplugged Gail
a whole lot better.

963
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.363
I do. too.

964
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.794
-Did he kiss her yet?
-I don't know.

965
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.339
Are they 12 years old?

966
00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:08.299
This is too much.

967
00:57:08.383 --> 00:57:09.467
Oh. man.

968
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.929
-Wanna look at the stars?
-Yeah.

969
00:59:00.453 --> 00:59:02.956
-You leave so soon.
-Yeah.

970
00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.666
How'd Rachael take it?

971
00:59:05.625 --> 00:59:06.960
Not so good.

972
00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:09.295
She's a crier.

973
00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:11.256
So. with this singing gig
you have.

974
00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:12.966
what happens after the show?

975
00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.801
Well. she's actually
gonna hit the road.

976
00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:16.344
She's gonna go on tour now.

977
00:59:16.427 --> 00:59:19.013
And yeah. She'll be on her way
to becoming a huge star.

978
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:21.474
Making some albums
and all that jazz.

979
00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:23.476
-Wow.
-Hmm.

980
00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:24.769
Yeah.

981
00:59:24.852 --> 00:59:27.021
I spent my whole life
on the road. so...

982
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:29.065
kinda used to it.

983
00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:33.486
So. who's gonna finish
getting the kids ready?

984
00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.446
He's sitting right next to me.

985
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.115
-Oh.

986
00:59:37.198 --> 00:59:38.491
-Okay.
-Our son?

987
00:59:38.574 --> 00:59:40.451
Uh-uh. I do not think so.

988
00:59:40.535 --> 00:59:42.662
That boy cannot sing a lick.

989
00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.622
Don't worry. They're ready.

990
00:59:44.706 --> 00:59:47.709
You have to get them
on the stage. okay?

991
00:59:47.792 --> 00:59:49.419
Yeah. Gotcha.

992
00:59:50.837 --> 00:59:53.006
He'll do it.

993
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:55.008
I'm gonna miss you all so much.

994
01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.476
I should get going. I have
a few more things to pack.

995
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.686
finish the song.

996
01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.271
I'll see you later. yeah?

997
01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:10.606
-Yeah. see you later.
-Okay.

998
01:00:12.066 --> 01:00:14.235
Here. no. I got it.
I'll get this.

999
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.989
-First time in his life.
-Go.

1000
01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:19.615
Go on now. Git!

1001
01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.367
-Thank you for dinner.
It was delicious.
-Thank you.

1002
01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.619
-You're welcome.
-So glad you could come.

1003
01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.687
Yeah.

1004
01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:52.190
This is Christmas.

1005
01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.150
-Come in.

1006
01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:01.074
I'm sorry.

1007
01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:02.658
Am I interrupting something?

1008
01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.912
I just wanted to make sure
I bid my farewell.

1009
01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.830
What are you doing for Jer?

1010
01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.666
What?

1011
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.379
You're not giving him
a thank you of any kind?

1012
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.589
He's the gesture type.

1013
01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:19.384
I've been so busy.
I didn't even think about that.

1014
01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.094
Mm-hmm.

1015
01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.137
You live in your van. right?

1016
01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.639
Mm-hmm.

1017
01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:26.891
So you're good
with small spaces.

1018
01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.521
Why don't I help you
set some of this stuff up?

1019
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:36.692
Oh. my gosh.

1020
01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:38.277
Look.

1021
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.155
I remember this being
right about here.

1022
01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:43.616
You sure he won't mind?

1023
01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:47.453
Girl. he's been dying
to tidy up this space.
Trust me.

1024
01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.372
He did say they
haven't had time--

1025
01:01:49.455 --> 01:01:50.581
Exactly!

1026
01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.084
It'll take less than
an hour. Come on.

1027
01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:57.839
Oh. I just love this.

1028
01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:03.678
Perfect.

1029
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:12.979
I love these movies.

1030
01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.605
Don't you love these movies?

1031
01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.784
Love you. Mom.

1032
01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.663
I love you.

1033
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:32.832
Door's open.

1034
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:35.877
Hi.

1035
01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:37.420
Thank you.

1036
01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.259
What... What did you do?

1037
01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.470
You said you hadn't
had time to fix it up

1038
01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:46.846
so I put it all together.

1039
01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:51.934
Why? Why...
Why would you do this?

1040
01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.227
-I wanted to thank you.
-No.

1041
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.771
Make it look nice. I--

1042
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.527
-Jeremy!

1043
01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.121
Van.

1044
01:03:13.706 --> 01:03:15.458
-Is Jeremy here?
-Come on.

1045
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:17.084
-Come on in.
-I really messed up here.

1046
01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:19.253
All right. breathe.
Breathe. okay?

1047
01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:22.632
Breathe. okay?
Sit down. Sit down.

1048
01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:26.469
Breathe. Breathe.
breathe. Okay.

1049
01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:29.138
-Talk to me.
-Scarlet said it
would be a good idea.

1050
01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:30.056
Scarlet?

1051
01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:34.644
I bet you're giving
that girl a run for her money.

1052
01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:37.230
She's been after Jeremy
since the day that she decided

1053
01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.106
boys did not have cooties.

1054
01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.236
What happened?

1055
01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:46.739
We decided to fix up the studio
with a bunch of boxed up stuff.

1056
01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:50.159
You know. I thought
it would be a nice thing to do
before I left.

1057
01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.869
Parker's studio?

1058
01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.625
I could never get him
out of that place.

1059
01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.753
He was always
writing somethin'.

1060
01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:06.717
That explains why I've had such
good luck with my songwriting.

1061
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.888
I've never felt so inspired.

1062
01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:13.266
Maybe it's not just the studio.

1063
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.436
It must've been such a shock.

1064
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.814
You know. seeing the studio
the same way it was

1065
01:04:19.897 --> 01:04:21.232
when Parker was alive.

1066
01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:22.900
I should've known.

1067
01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.611
There was all this music stuff
everywhere. I should've known.

1068
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.155
Honey. honey.
your intentions were good.

1069
01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.668
Abe and I were...

1070
01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:46.716
We were lucky
we had each other
when it happened.

1071
01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:49.594
Jeremy...

1072
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.138
he just isolated.

1073
01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:56.058
He just threw himself
into his work. you know.

1074
01:04:56.142 --> 01:05:00.104
and he didn't give himself
time to process it and...

1075
01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:06.360
They say that there's nothing
worse than losing a child.

1076
01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.949
and I lost two that day.

1077
01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.537
-Two.
-I'm sorry. Van.

1078
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.290
I'm so sorry.

1079
01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:22.501
He's come up for air
for the first time in years.

1080
01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.837
He's cooking again.

1081
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.050
and he's playing music
when he works.

1082
01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:34.388
And there's a light
right back in his eyes.

1083
01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:39.935
And the only thing
that has changed...

1084
01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.774
is you being here.

1085
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.945
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

1086
01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.785
I made you some tea.

1087
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.997
Come on. it's late.
Take a break.

1088
01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.263
We all miss him. you know.

1089
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:23.312
Jeremy.

1090
01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.147
Jeremy?

1091
01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.400
Look at me.

1092
01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.571
Son...

1093
01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:36.242
you have been drowning
for so long

1094
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:39.036
that you don't even feel it

1095
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.499
when you pull the people
that are the closest to you
into the undertow.

1096
01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.211
We all loved him.

1097
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.089
So much.

1098
01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:56.011
But he would not want
to see you behaving this way.

1099
01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.978
I shouldn't have
snapped at her.

1100
01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:08.774
It happens.

1101
01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.903
The question is.
what are you gonna do now?

1102
01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:06.415
Hey. guys. It's Gail.
I'm still in Oklahoma.

1103
01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.334
I've been. uh...

1104
01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:10.503
I...

1105
01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:14.215
I have nothing to say
to a faceless piece of glass.

1106
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.228
I know. I know. I'm late.

1107
01:08:27.311 --> 01:08:29.021
iHeart Radio. they sent an--

1108
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.234
Sent an email.

1109
01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:34.610
As stage manager.

1110
01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:37.154
I hereby declare
the first quarter of this class

1111
01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.531
dedicated to Jeremy Crawford

1112
01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:41.575
and his heart-felt
sincerest apology.

1113
01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:43.244
Hit it. Jeff.

1114
01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.047
I'm sorry.

1115
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.131
Do you forgive him?

1116
01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:58.259
Say yes.

1117
01:08:58.342 --> 01:09:00.261
We wanted to give you
something special.

1118
01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.471
To remember us by.

1119
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.515
Hope it fits.

1120
01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.143
What is this?

1121
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:09.270
I sewed the snowman on myself.

1122
01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:12.815
Your Christmas tradition.

1123
01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.818
It's the same one.

1124
01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:23.242
Thank you.

1125
01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.703
Aw. Thank you. guys.

1126
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:35.004
Guys. this is amazing.
Thank you.

1127
01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:40.426
My tip box.

1128
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:41.552
It may help.

1129
01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:45.514
I'm sorry for how I reacted.

1130
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.479
Look at these.

1131
01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.991
-Scarlet said that--
-You know what? Doesn't matter.

1132
01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.619
You were right. I was wrong.

1133
01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.622
Well. a girl loves
to hear that.

1134
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.378
Ooh!

1135
01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.173
All right.

1136
01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:23.427
Hey. This county doesn't know
what's coming for them.

1137
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.471
Okay?

1138
01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.014
Whatever happens at the gala...

1139
01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.309
just know you already won
in my eyes.

1140
01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:34.813
Here.

1141
01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.565
-Don't peek.
-Doing.

1142
01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.901
Go ahead.

1143
01:10:42.863 --> 01:10:44.281
Wow.

1144
01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:47.284
She's beautiful.

1145
01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:50.037
Yeah. Yes. she is.

1146
01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.208
Here.

1147
01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.044
Got something for ya.

1148
01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:58.420
What job's this one from?

1149
01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.839
Oh. no. This one's
actually mine.

1150
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:04.093
I was thinking you could hold
onto it for me for a while...

1151
01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:05.719
and take it with you
on your travels.

1152
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.517
Uh. you said something in class
earlier about iHeart.

1153
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.522
Yes. They need a good recording
of my song. but I. uh...

1154
01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.817
I don't have anyone
to help me record it.

1155
01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.527
-Mm.

1156
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.443
Wow.

1157
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.864
Gail. that was. uh...

1158
01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:11.160
That was beautiful.
It was really amazing.

1159
01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.121
Thank you.

1160
01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.126
Well.

1161
01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:21.003
it sent. so...

1162
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.714
Thank you.

1163
01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:45.778
I think it's time we take off
some jackets.

1164
01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:06.859
Hey.

1165
01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.195
Good mornin'.

1166
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.655
We need to talk.

1167
01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.759
I'm sorry. I should've been
honest with you sooner.

1168
01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:33.886
You should've.

1169
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.766
Look. I'm sorry I pushed you
so much. Jeremy. I just...

1170
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.021
I really thought
we'd end up together.

1171
01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.316
Scarlet...

1172
01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:49.568
we just weren't
right for each other.

1173
01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:52.654
I'm sorry.

1174
01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.364
You got a huge place
in my heart.

1175
01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:55.741
Always.

1176
01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:13.342
Bye. Jer.

1177
01:15:25.812 --> 01:15:26.855
Hey.

1178
01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:31.485
Was this all some game to you?

1179
01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.111
What?

1180
01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.323
Am I some fling?
To make Scarlet jealous?

1181
01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:39.826
Some toy in your complicated
relationship? I mean. we just--

1182
01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.246
Why did I trust you?

1183
01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:44.581
It's not what you think.

1184
01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:45.999
I know what I saw.

1185
01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:53.257
Does it matter?

1186
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.633
I mean...

1187
01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.346
you were always
on borrowed time here. Gail.

1188
01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:01.265
What is that supposed to mean?

1189
01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:07.521
The world needs to hear
that voice of yours.

1190
01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.232
You can't do that from here.

1191
01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.443
What you did last night...

1192
01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.738
you don't belong here.

1193
01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.740
There's nothin' for you here.

1194
01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.123
I don't want you here. Gail.

1195
01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:32.212
-So. that's it then?

1196
01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.508
This is how we say goodbye?

1197
01:16:45.892 --> 01:16:49.062
<i> Lila. I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>My phone got destroyed.</i>

1198
01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.523
Um. I crashed Jewel.

1199
01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.400
I'm on my way to LA.

1200
01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:55.444
and. boy. do I have
a story for you.

1201
01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.405
I go live Christmas Eve.

1202
01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.409
Bye. Talk to you later.

1203
01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:28.310
Is she gone?

1204
01:17:31.521 --> 01:17:33.690
I had to let her go.

1205
01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:35.817
Couldn't have been
the reason she stayed.

1206
01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.031
You should've heard her sing.

1207
01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.534
Oh. honey.

1208
01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:46.995
I'm sorry.

1209
01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:22.697
Gail Travers has landed.
Miss Travers has landed.

1210
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:24.449
-Hey. you Miss Travers?
-Hi.

1211
01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:25.701
Great.

1212
01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.703
Follow me.

1213
01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:29.955
<i>What's your 20?</i>

1214
01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.415
Stepping in.

1215
01:18:34.626 --> 01:18:35.794
Thank you.

1216
01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.093
Well. you know.
I never thought I'd be sitting
here in this chair

1217
01:18:43.176 --> 01:18:44.845
ready for the new Sia album

1218
01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:47.889
-and a mystery Christmas
album at that.
-I know. right?

1219
01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.933
But we like to keep things
interesting around here.

1220
01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:51.685
We sure do.
And you know what.

1221
01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:53.353
we're gonna take a quick
commercial break

1222
01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:55.021
and when we come back.
we're gonna talk about

1223
01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:56.940
our big Christmas Eve Special

1224
01:18:57.023 --> 01:18:59.985
and our five lucky
opening guests.

1225
01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.820
Cut. That's a cut.

1226
01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.530
Let me see that video again.

1227
01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:05.115
Yeah. It's so good.

1228
01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:09.202
So good.

1229
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.329
Can't wait to meet her.

1230
01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.789
Have all five landed yet?

1231
01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:14.666
Gail. Gail Travers.

1232
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.168
-Hi.

-Gail.
-Gail.

weird in the mouth. right?

1309
01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.259
-Thick.
-Thick.

1310
01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:55.970
Can you hold on one sec?

1311
01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:58.139

-The look. it's...
It's just not clicking for me.
-Flying in a jacket.

1313
01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:00.975
Fast. fast. fast.

1314

really cute.
-That's...

1318
01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:09.609
I'm sorry.
My blood sugar's low.

1319
01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:11.528
-I don't know.
I'm all over the place.
-That's Sarah. by the way.

1320
01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:13.321
-Then who's Tiffany?
-You fired her.

1321
01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.573
That does track.

1322
01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.117
-Oh. you can go up now.
-Mm.

1323
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.702
Lose the bag.

1324
01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:46.229
-Really?
-Just watch this.

1325
01:23:46.312 --> 01:23:47.939
Okay.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just need a moment.

Keep it quick.

1337
01:26:00.154 --> 01:26:01.698
There.

1338
01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:03.241
-We won't need it.
-We could make us...
That's true.

1339
01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:05.827
-We won't need it.
-Well. maybe. we won't.

1340
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:07.453
Hello?

1341
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.247
Hello?

1342
01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.415
Don't. who is it?
Don't tell me you have to

1343
01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:11.666
-go to the shop.
-Oh. hey. honey.

1344
01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:14.210
It's Gail.
Hey. hey. hey. honey.

1345
01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.254
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1346
01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.548
How many times
have you asked me that now?

1347
01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:21.676
Hurry up.

1348
01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:24.846
I sure wish
I could see your face.

1349
01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:26.681
You're gonna need
a new phone for that.

1350
01:26:29.809 --> 01:26:31.185
What's goin' on?

1351
01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:34.772
I didn't know who else to call.

1352
01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:38.902
I don't know what to do.
Everything...

1353
01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:41.821
Everything here
is just so different.

1354
01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:43.281
What do you mean?

1355
01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:44.908
<i>There's just so many people.</i>
<i>So many people.</i>

1356
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:47.368
They're just trying
to plan my style.

1357
01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:49.454
my identity. my future...

1358
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:53.124
There's just so many voices

1359
01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:55.418
that I feel like
I'm losing mine.

1360
01:26:55.501 --> 01:26:57.045
Oh.

1361
01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.923
Okay.

1362
01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:02.550
When you started singing.

1363
01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.719
what did you want
out of all of it?

1364
01:27:04.802 --> 01:27:06.554
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1365
01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:08.514
I want to sing
because I love it.

1366
01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:10.975
But why this way?

1367
01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:14.228
Fans.

1368
01:27:15.688 --> 01:27:17.565
Because?

1369
01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:20.693
Well. they're the only ones
who ever stuck around for me.

1370
01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:22.654
Oh.

1371
01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:26.240
That's not what fans are for.
that's what family's for.

1372
01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:29.744
<i>Now I know that</i>
<i>you didn't have one</i>
<i>for a very long time...</i>

1373
01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:34.999
but now. you have us.

1374
01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:38.127
<i>And sweetheart. no matter</i>
<i>how far. no matter how long</i>
<i>you're gone.</i>

1375
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.922
<i>you can always</i>
<i>come back here. Gail.</i>

1376
01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:44.717
Harmony Springs
is here for you.

1377
01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:49.722
<i>And listen. if those fans</i>
<i>don't love you</i>
<i>for who you truly are...</i>

1378
01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:52.016
<i>I don't think you</i>
<i>really want this.</i>

1379
01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.187
Maybe you're right.

1380
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.443
I'm probably overstepping here.

1381
01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.696
but. um. Jeremy told me
what happened.

1382
01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:07.031
<i>And I just... I just</i>
<i>need you to know that</i>

1383
01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:08.574
it wasn't what you thought.

1384
01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:12.370
<i>Jeremy told Scarlet</i>
<i>how he really felt...</i>

1385
01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:14.497
<i>about you.</i>

1386
01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.833
He just didn't wanna be
the reason that

1387
01:28:16.916 --> 01:28:18.918
you second-guess
this opportunity.

1388
01:28:23.172 --> 01:28:26.801
Okay. Well. we love you.

1389
01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:29.846
I love you. too.

1390
01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.890
All of you in Harmony Springs.

1391
01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:36.394
<i>-Oh. Van?</i>
-Yeah?

1392
01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:38.563
Could you remind the kids
to sing from the heart

1393
01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:42.358
<i>tonight at the gala?</i>
<i>The county is not</i>
<i>gonna know what hit 'em.</i>

1394
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:45.653
I just wish that
I could be there to see it.

1395
01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:48.656
Thank you.

1396
01:28:49.782 --> 01:28:50.783
Bye.

1397
01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.429
-She's right. you know.

1398
01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.513
Your mom.

1399
01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:17.685
Oh. she's not...
She's not my...

1400
01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:21.731
Anyway. um. I'm sorry that
you had to hear all that.

1401
01:29:21.814 --> 01:29:23.566
You don't have to explain.

1402
01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:25.651
I've been exactly
where you are.

1403
01:29:25.735 --> 01:29:27.320
But. Gail. you're good.

1404
01:29:27.403 --> 01:29:28.738
I mean. really good.

1405
01:29:28.821 --> 01:29:31.115
With or without
that record label.

1406
01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.700
Thank you.

1407
01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.702
And do you know how many times
people have tried to get me

1408
01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:37.080
to be cuter. girlier.

1409
01:29:37.163 --> 01:29:40.458
more country. less country.
I mean...

1410
01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.126
I can't keep up.

1411
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:46.172
But I learned to hold on
to my favorite version
of myself.

1412
01:29:46.255 --> 01:29:50.551
So you've got to hang on tight
to what makes you you.

1413
01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.304
You have to remember
that's what got you here.

1414
01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:57.767
And I promise if you do that.
Gail. the sky's the limit.

1415
01:29:59.143 --> 01:30:00.436
Thank you. Amy.

1416
01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.897
My travel agent's info.
it's in your inbox.

1417
01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.775
So. I want you to know.
if you need
to get to that gala.

1418
01:30:05.858 --> 01:30:08.319
you got a plane ticket.
you got a car service.

1419
01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:11.906
Seriously. whatever you need
you decide.

1420
01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:14.158
-But what about my bus?
-It's handled.

1421
01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.535
Done.

1422
01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:19.372
Good luck. Gail Travers.

1423
01:30:19.455 --> 01:30:20.540
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1424
01:30:20.623 --> 01:30:22.333
Us girls gotta stick together.

1425
01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.501
Yeah.

1426
01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:24.794
'Kay. bye.

1427
01:30:46.732 --> 01:30:48.526
Sisanie. I think
I have an idea.

1428
01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:49.735
Oh. yeah?

1429
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.167
Hello?

1430
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:06.878
<i>Ma'am. this is Amy Brown</i>
<i>from iHeart Radio.</i>

1431
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:09.922
<i>I'm thinking maybe</i>
<i>you can help me with somethin'.</i>

1432
01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.260
Deep breath.

1433
01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:20.558
Release your intentions.

1434
01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.735
I'm sure those are really
great intentions. guys.

1435
01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.278
-You made it!
-Yes!

1436
01:31:32.361 --> 01:31:36.574
How in the world
could I miss it?
You guys look great!

1437
01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:38.075
Wow.

1438
01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.578
Okay. people. Look alive.
We're on in three minutes.

1439
01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.080
Okay. let's all head toward
backstage. okay? Come on.

1440
01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:44.790
-Come on.
-Okay. Come on. people.

1441
01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:45.666
-I'll be there in a minute.
-Come on. Let's go. let's go...

1442
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:46.667
Okay.

1443
01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:49.670
Hey. what's goin' on. Rosemary?

1444
01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:53.174
It's just. there's...
There's a lot of people
out there.

1445
01:31:55.092 --> 01:31:58.179
Our class was small and...

1446
01:31:58.262 --> 01:32:00.389
I can't sing in front of that
many humans.

1447
01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.433
Hey. Hey...

1448
01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:06.562
You taught me
that being perfect
isn't better.

1449
01:32:07.647 --> 01:32:09.315
Whatever happens out there.

1450
01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:11.317
it's you.

1451
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:15.863
And I haven't met
one single human
who hasn't loved you.

1452
01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.157
Show 'em you. okay?

1453
01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:19.408
You got this.

1454
01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:42.974
You know...

1455
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:47.311
the whole "If you love her.
let her go" thing...

1456
01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:51.524
doesn't work every time.

1457
01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:56.737
Sorry. That whole. uh...

1458
01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:58.322
That whole Scarlet thing...

1459
01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.490
I know.

1460
01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:00.950
I know.

1461
01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:07.248
You... You know
I took Parker from his dream.

1462
01:33:12.378 --> 01:33:13.879
Couldn't do that with you.

1463
01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:23.889
He made a choice
and now I'm making one.

1464
01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:32.064
I always hoped that somehow
my singing would bring me
to a home of my own.

1465
01:33:33.899 --> 01:33:39.530
I've never felt more loved
or seen than I do right here.

1466
01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:48.122
I always thought that
I couldn't write songs
because I wasn't good...

1467
01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:54.086
but now I realize that
I just needed something...

1468
01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:59.008
someone to write songs about.

1469
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.566
-What's your plan?
-Here's my plan.

1470
01:34:18.944 --> 01:34:22.406
I stick around
and keep teaching
the music program.

1471
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.824
if you'll have me.

1472
01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:26.327
Uh. I can't do that.
We just gave the job away.

1473
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:27.953
Oh. man.

1474
01:34:28.037 --> 01:34:29.538
-I'm kidding.

1475
01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.123
You might just
save the program.

1476
01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.876
Speaking of which. we...
We'd better go.

1477
01:34:33.959 --> 01:34:35.086
Come on.
we got a show to watch.

1478
01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:36.504
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Let's go.

1479
01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:03.989
Wow. Yay!

1480
01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:06.450
Come on. come on.
Can we get another round
of applause

1481
01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.286
for the Canton County
Bear Cubs?

1482
01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:18.045
And up next. we have our final
performance of the night.

1483
01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.631
your host city. the town

1484
01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:22.883
of Harmony Springs.

1485
01:35:26.178 --> 01:35:28.472
Light cue one.

1486
01:37:47.152 --> 01:37:50.364
Harmony Springs! Whoo!

1487
01:37:50.447 --> 01:37:52.116
Oh. my God.

1488
01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.743
Come on. Come on.
let's give it up

1489
01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:57.121
for the Harmony Springs
Middle School.

1490
01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:58.831
All right!

1491
01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:15.931
What's happening?

1492
01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:21.979
The winner of the One Hundredth
Annual Henderson County
Christmas Gala is...

1493
01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:28.360

1494
01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:50.382
-Okay. Here you go.
-Okay. Yeah.

1495
01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:51.884
Okay. all right.
Now I need to do something.

1496
01:38:51.967 --> 01:38:55.346

Streaming on Facetime.

1497
01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:58.515
-I. I got this. Okay?
-I...

1498
01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:00.517
-Do you have the number
we're supposed to call?
-Oh. yes.

1499
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:03.354
-Thank you.
-All right. All right.

1500
01:39:07.858 --> 01:39:11.695
Okay. Now all you have to do is

1501
01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:13.197

1502
01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.824
-straight towards Miss Travers.
-Okay.

1503
01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:17.701
-Great. Okay.
-Okay?

1504
01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:20.454
-I think I got it.
-Let's try horizon...
That way. There we go.

1505
01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:22.498
-Maybe you wanna get...
-That's means to the side.
Okay.

1506
01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:25.209
a better angle from downstairs?

1507
01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:27.002
Oh. good idea.

1508
01:39:27.086 --> 01:39:28.587

-Is this thing on?
-Okay.

1513
01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:42.184
We want to invite
our music teacher

1514
01:39:42.267 --> 01:39:44.228
-What?
-Miss Travers?

1515
01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:47.523
To thank you

from the heart...

1517
01:39:49.608 --> 01:39:52.069
-We wanted to do
something for you.
-What are you doing?

1518
01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:53.904
Please sing for us!

1519

Wow. wow. wow.

I am so proud of all
of our amazing kids.

01:40:16.552 --> 01:40:18.929
Thank you all so much.

1527
01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:20.431
You really want me to sing?

1528
01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:29.648
I was gonna sing this song...

1529
01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.567
on national television...

1530
01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:35.070
but singing it right here.
right now...

1531
01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:37.573
feels even more special to me.

1532
01:40:37.656 --> 01:40:39.116
Thank you. Harmony Springs...

1533
01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:42.202

-One point nine million people
just watched you.
-No... What?

1547
01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.209
How did you do that?

1548
01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:01.712

Every time.

1557
01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:33.136
Who's ready to rock?
