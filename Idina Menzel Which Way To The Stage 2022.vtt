177
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.084
[Nejat] I should know who that is.
but I don't.

-Sorry. Josh.

180
00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.506
[Nejat] Not a great cycle to start.

181
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.384
[Menzel] Right. Maybe it's 'cause
I'm just all over the place.

182
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:16.765
[Nejat] Could be. but it's also
not uncommon in this age bracket.

I wanted to have a baby.

But then. Aaron has been
the most amazing man to my son.

188

who has a wonderful dad.

189
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:39.120

[interviewer] Good camera shot.

233
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.710
In theater. you practice changes

234
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:54.422
so that you can choreograph them
and get them down.

235
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:56.049

you can get them down in nine seconds.

We don't know if it ripped before
the change or not.

But one of the other costumes was already
ripped before we ever left New York.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.533
But January and February
are the worst months for weddings

324
00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.619
'cause it's cold. and nobody gets married
in January and February.

325
00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.122
So I just thought I need a job.

326
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.708
So. I went in for this little
Off-Broadway show.

And then my parents split up.
and my life turned upside down.

438
00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:12.332
So this is like a catering hall.

439
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:15.794
Like a lot of people come here
and they get married or have parties.

440
00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:18.880
When I was 15. on Thanksgiving morning.

441
00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:22.676
my parents brought my sister and I
down to the kitchen table

442
00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.761
and they told us they were separating.

443
00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:28.890
And that they were gonna cancel
all the guests that were coming over.

444
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.892
our extended family. and. um…

445
00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:36.356
That we're gonna salvage the day. though.

446
00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:40.443
because in an effort
to show my sister and I that we would…

447
00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:46.908
that it would always be amicable
and that we'd still be a family.

448
00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:50.912
we wanted-- they wanted
to still go to dinner. Thanksgiving.

449
00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:53.665
And my sister and I are like crying
up in our rooms.

450
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.712
And so my mom throws
the mashed potatoes down the drain

451
00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:01.047
and the turkey in the garbage.

452
00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:04.342
and makes a reservation
to come here and sit in public.

453
00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.844
[Stuart] <i>Hey. honey. How are you doing?</i>

454

456
00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:12.767
I'm at the Fox Hollow Inn.
On Jericho Turnpike.

-Does this look familiar to you?

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:23.069
Does it bring back memories?

460
00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:25.613

Thanksgiving morning

461
00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:26.990
to just break it to us?

462
00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:28.742

463
00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.036

<i>on Thanksgiving morning?</i>

-Yeah.

465
00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:34.247
Literally Thanksgiving morning.
Like. wouldn't you tell--

466
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.708
Wouldn't you and Mommy be like.
"Let's wait till tomorrow.

467
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.793
We can hold it in.
We've waited this long"?

468
00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:43.048
[Stuart] <i>Honey.</i>
<i>I-- I don't actually remember.</i>

469

<i>I actually have never been back</i>
<i>to that place.</i>

470
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.594
But then. you know.
then I came here all the time

471
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:49.304
and had gigs here all the time.

472
00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:51.097
-I'd sing at bar mitzvahs and weddings…
-<i>Well--</i>

473
00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:53.224
…and I had to be reminded
of this horrible day

474
00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:55.393
every time I came here
to make a buck and sing.

475

[Menzel] During these tough times.

478
00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:07.405
my younger sister. Cara. and I.
we got really close.

479
00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:10.825
She always was really protective of me
but I think even then.

480
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:14.746
when she kind of felt that our world was
shaking. was kind of falling apart.

481
00:24:14.829 --> 00:24:18.249
then she was even more protective
in making sure I was okay.

482
00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.168

It's one thing about me.
maybe it's the pessimist.

00:33:52.574 --> 00:33:55.035
but I never celebrate too long.

661
00:33:55.118 --> 00:33:57.287
Yeah. it's probably because…

662
00:34:00.165 --> 00:34:01.374
when your parents divorce.

663
00:34:01.458 --> 00:34:04.419
and you don't expect
that they would ever get divorced.

664
00:34:04.502 --> 00:34:07.505
I think that that's changed
the way that I see my whole life.

665
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:09.424
'Cause you never know.
Nothing is ever what it seems.

666
00:34:09.507 --> 00:34:12.719
So. like. sure.
this show. <i>Rent</i>. seemed cool

667
00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:15.638
and it seemed like something
really special. but you never know.

668
00:34:15.722 --> 00:34:17.432
It could just end tomorrow. or…

669
00:34:17.515 --> 00:34:20.477
You get this big Broadway show.
you get an agent.

670
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.521
You get a record deal
that I've been trying to get.

671
00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:25.565
I had some money. you know?

672
00:34:27.317 --> 00:34:28.943
So. you think it's happening.

673
00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:33.990
Then after my record deal. and the album
came out. and it didn't do anything.

674
00:34:34.074 --> 00:34:37.827
Literally. two people would be at each bar
we showed up at. I was like.

675
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.663
"I have a big album coming out
and I just came out of this hit show.

676
00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:41.998
Where are all the people?"

677
00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:46.544
And then I got dropped. and then
the momentum from <i>Rent</i> was gone.

678
00:34:46.628 --> 00:34:50.548
I sold no records.
I went into obscurity for a couple years.

679
00:34:50.632 --> 00:34:52.884
I-I-- I've had a lot of highs and lows.

680
00:34:52.967 --> 00:34:56.888
so you start to realize how fleeting
all this stuff can be. and how you just--

681
00:34:56.971 --> 00:34:58.890
When it comes. you gotta--
you gotta grasp it.

682
00:34:58.973 --> 00:35:01.142
This was my first single.
It's called "Minuet."

683
00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:03.812
The single was sixth most added
on the radio

684
00:35:03.895 --> 00:35:05.522
of the first week it came out.

685
00:35:05.605 --> 00:35:08.316
-[crowd cheering]
-It was between Madonna's "Ray of Light"

686
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.401
and some Babyface song.

687
00:35:09.484 --> 00:35:10.527
I don't remember what it was.

688
00:35:11.111 --> 00:35:14.406
And I just thought. you know.
I had it all figured out.

689
00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:17.951
I had. like. the rock star fantasy
in my head. I just knew.

690
00:35:18.034 --> 00:35:22.455
I just knew. the next day. they were gonna
be flying me back to New York in a jet.

691
00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:24.124
Steven Meisel was gonna be waiting there

692
00:35:24.207 --> 00:35:26.418
to take my picture
for the cover of <i>Rolling Stone</i>.

693
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:29.045
Next thing you know.
I'd be whisked off in a limousine

694
00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:32.215
to where I'd be opening
at Madison Square Garden.

695
00:35:32.882 --> 00:35:36.386
And I'd get there. and I'm just. like.
walking towards the light.

696
00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:37.470
And I hear. like…

697
00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:43.476
-They're waiting for me. "Idina! Idina!"

My first big break.

1189
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:46.748
Back in New York City down in the Village.

1190
01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:50.752
Ah. and it changed my life. it really did.

1191
01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:53.505
Just. uh…

1192
01:01:56.091 --> 01:02:00.595
finally someone seeing something
in me and hiring me and believing in me.

1193
01:02:00.679 --> 01:02:04.015
And that man was Jonathan Larson.
who was the composer of <i>Rent</i>.

1194
01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:08.103
[applause]

1195
01:02:08.186 --> 01:02:09.979
He wrote a show all about--

1196
01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:12.399
Well. really love.

1197
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.778
About loving whoever the hell you want.

1198
01:02:16.861 --> 01:02:20.532
And. um. embracing the moment.
not taking things for granted.

1199
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:23.076
not taking people for granted.

1200
01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:31.918
Trying to stay present. you know. and live
every day as though it's our last.

1201
01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:36.881
And. uh. he didn't--
he didn't stay with us very long.

1202
01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:39.426
We lost him very early on in our process.

1203
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:42.012
[Menzel sighs] The night of our first--

1204
01:02:42.595 --> 01:02:45.932
It was supposed to be your first audience.
The night of our first audience.

1205
01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:49.561
We were supposed to show up
at around three o'clock at the theater.

1206
01:02:49.644 --> 01:02:53.148
and we got a call and told us
to come a little bit later.

1207
01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:58.486
that Jonathan Larson had passed away on--
in his kitchen. in his apartment downtown.

1208
01:03:01.197 --> 01:03:02.198
So. um…

1209
01:03:03.783 --> 01:03:04.951
that was just crazy.

1210
01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:10.540
We dedicate this opening night and every
performance to our friend Jonathan Larson.

1211
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:14.044
[Menzel] And it became this mission
for everyone involved to--

1212
01:03:14.127 --> 01:03:16.046
It was more than just.
"Wow. we got our first Broadway show."

1213
01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:19.424
It was like now we had a mission
to get forth this man's music

1214
01:03:19.507 --> 01:03:22.093
and his love and his message and. um…

1215
01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:23.178
[clears throat]

1216
01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:26.348
He was a struggling artist
just like the rest of us.

1217
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:28.808
So everything's always been
so bittersweet about that

1218
01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:33.980
because he never got to enjoy

1219
01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:37.233
all of the accolades

1220
01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:44.532

back our way through that show.

he wrote this show
about tolerance and love…

of the tour. we're playing in DC.

1622
01:27:13.983 --> 01:27:16.945
and we hear a high school there was
putting on their own production of <i>Rent</i>.

1623
01:27:17.028 --> 01:27:18.905
We're going to surprise this class.

1632

[Menzel] Hi. guys.

1633

I love your hair.

1634
01:27:57.527 --> 01:27:59.112
[student] One of the big messages
of the show

1635
01:27:59.195 --> 01:28:01.823
is to live in the moment
and not take anything for granted.

1636
01:28:01.906 --> 01:28:04.409
Do you think that you took that
into your own life?

1637
01:28:04.492 --> 01:28:06.369
I think I do. Yeah.

1638
01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:08.705
I forget all the time. obviously.

1639
01:28:08.788 --> 01:28:11.041
I have my own anxiety

1640
01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:15.962
and. um. my own neuroses
and fears and nerves.

1641
01:28:16.046 --> 01:28:18.048
and all those things
that I contend with still.

1642
01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:21.051
At your age. I was just. like.
let me at-- Let me at it.

1643
01:28:21.134 --> 01:28:22.135
I can wow anybody.

1644
01:28:22.218 --> 01:28:25.305
As I got older.
maybe more people are looking at me.

1645
01:28:25.388 --> 01:28:30.560
Sometimes it makes me get a little bit
more. um. introverted and insecure.

1646
01:28:30.643 --> 01:28:35.148
But being a mom and a parent
helps me also stay in the moment.

1647
01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:40.737
Because if I'm gonna think too much about
all the other superficial things in life.

1648
01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.739
I'll-- I have to worry about my child.
you know?

1650
01:28:44.616 --> 01:28:48.995
I think that everyone tries to survive
in this world and make their way.

1651
01:28:49.079 --> 01:28:50.997
We all find different ways to do that.

1652
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:54.334
and some of us feel like
we have to take the safer path.

1653
01:28:55.543 --> 01:28:57.712

a bit more comfortable
