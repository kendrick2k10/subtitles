3
00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:21.646
Em. Em.

4
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.562
- Get her to the sofa.
- It's okay.

5
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.216
Charlotte.

6
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:29.393
Anne. find papa.

7
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.526
Oh. it's just a bad cold.

8
00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:37.662
They shouldn't be too long.
my love.

9
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.941
- 'What is it. my love?'
- Hmm. there's nothing.

10
00:01:57.813 --> 00:01:59.380
'There is something.'

11
00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:06.038
'How did you write it?'

12
00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.739
'How did you write
Weathering Heights?'

13
00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:15.222
I took my pen
and put it to paper.

14
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:18.138
There's something more.

15
00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:22.011
Something you're hiding from me.

16
00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:23.621
Why is it so hard
for you to believe

17
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.841
that your sister could write
something of merit?

18
00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:29.497
'It's an ugly book.'

19
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.240
'It's bias and ugly'

20
00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:36.373
'and full of selfish people
who only care for themselves.'

21
00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:41.596
Good.

22
00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:52.911
There is something.

23
00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.065
Captain Sneaky.

24
00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:05.157
Captain?

25
00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:08.857
Soldiers are waiting
for your command. ma'am.

26
00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:11.686
Thank you. Captain.

27
00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:16.778
Captain.

28
00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:20.129
Yes. ma'am?

29
00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:24.176
I've been thinking of
what you said. sir.

30
00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.093
And what did you think. ma'am?

31
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.838
You are..

32
00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:36.928
...measurably important
to this kingdom. sir.

33
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.800
Thank you. ma'am.

34
00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:41.368
What I meant to say before is..

35
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.370
...you're more important
to me than anyone.

36
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:46.155
And..

37
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:51.813
She's here.

38
00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:54.555
I'll take me leave. captain.

39
00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:30.417
- Charlotte. You're back.
- Anne.

40
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:36.466
- Father.
- Welcome home.

41
00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:38.512
Oh. Branwell.

42
00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.036
Charlotte. my girl.
we missed you.

43
00:05:41.123 --> 00:05:43.299
I missed you all so much.

44
00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:45.345
Wee congratulations.
young doll.

45
00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:47.912
'Yes. they want me to stay on
as a teacher after I graduate.'

46
00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.784
- 'Oh. wonderful.'
- 'Wonderful. Charlotte.'

47
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.612
'Charlotte. that's great.'

48
00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.178
'I wouldn't expect
anything less.

49
00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:54.397
'I'm so proud.'

50
00:05:54.484 --> 00:05:55.920
'I wish I was going.'

51
00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:57.705
- 'Emily's turn first.'
- 'Where is that girl?'

52
00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:01.273
- 'Daydreaming no doubt.'
- 'Em!'

53
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.666
There she is.

54
00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:04.233
There's my scruff.

55
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.540
Em. Charlotte's been
offered a teaching position

56
00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:08.150
at the school
after she graduates.

57
00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:09.760
Where have you been.
Emily Jane?

58
00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:13.895
Working on my French. papa.

59
00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:16.724
Mm. Come and help your aunt.

60
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:18.421
Your sister'll be hungry.

61
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:27.909
'Just excited to see her.'

62
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:33.610
Is that you in there?

63
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.268
- It's me.
- You look different.

64
00:06:39.355 --> 00:06:41.401
I'm just the same.

65
00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:43.446
Come here.

66
00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:47.885
And then they traveled
on the wings of the dragon

67
00:06:47.972 --> 00:06:49.234
and they find Captain Sneaky.

68
00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:51.759
Captain Sneaky?

69
00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:53.630
Mm. It's just for fun.

70
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:57.068
I'm writing other things.

71
00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:58.983
We both are. Anne and I.

72
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.942
More serious affair.

73
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:02.509
What have you been writing?

74
00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.424
I haven't had time
to write anything.

75
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:08.428
But you must write.

76
00:07:10.647 --> 00:07:12.519
Are you looking forward
to starting at school?

77
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.872
- Yes.
- They're all dying to meet you.

78
00:07:20.265 --> 00:07:23.181
Is it nice having friends
outside the family?

79
00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.618
Of course.

80
00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:31.363
You've been working
on your French. <i>Oui?</i>

81
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.452
<i>Oui.</i>

82
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.663
What?

83
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.579
- You said "His bottom."
- What?

84
00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:21.152
'Emily.'

85
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:25.243
I meant the end.

86
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.289
The ending of it.

87
00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:28.986
I know you did.

88
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.250
I think Captain Sneaky
should return to battle

89
00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:33.600
before the dawn.

90
00:08:33.687 --> 00:08:35.471
No. Esmeral's waiting
for him. remember?

91
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.865
He must journey far across
the desert and into the--

92
00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:40.563
You mustn't talk that way.

93
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.305
- What way?
- At the school..

94
00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:45.089
'You won't.
will you. Emily Jane?'

95
00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:49.441
- It's just a story.
- It'll draw attention.

96
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.921
'It's strange.'

97
00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:55.665
'And from the wrath
of the land'

98
00:08:55.752 --> 00:09:00.931
for the great day
of His wrath hath come..

99
00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:04.587
...and who shall be
able to stand?

100
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:08.504
'Amen.'

101
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:10.245
Amen.

102
00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:11.725
'And now. brethren'

103
00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:14.641
'it's my duty
to introduce to you today'

104
00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:17.513
'our new curate
Mr. William Weightman.'

105
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.429
'He's going to assist me in this
great wager against sin.'

106
00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:22.257
'I'd like to
ask Mr. Weightman. uh'

107
00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:26.087
'graduate of Oxford University
no less. say a few words.'

108
00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:40.580
'Thank you. Reverent Bronte.
for your very kind words.'

109
00:09:42.494 --> 00:09:46.194
Brethren. it rained my
entire journey up here.

110
00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:49.197
It rained and it rained

111
00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:53.288
and it rained and I thought..

112
00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:54.811
"...Where in God's name
have I landed?"

113
00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:00.774
'And as it continued to rain'

114
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.690
'I began to think
about what I might say'

115
00:10:03.777 --> 00:10:08.346
at my new. slightly damp
congregation.

116
00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:12.307
And it occurred to me
to talk about the rain.

117
00:10:12.394 --> 00:10:14.831
'Because generally
I-I do love it.'

118
00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:18.835
To walk in it..

119
00:10:18.922 --> 00:10:23.057
...the feel of it.
the smell of it. and..

120
00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:25.886
Especially. especially
if you lie awake at night

121
00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:28.323
and listen to it.

122
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.020
There's nothing quite like that.

123
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:35.112
'And often. when..'

124
00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:38.115
'...I'm listening to the rain
in my bed late at night'

125
00:10:38.202 --> 00:10:41.597
'I am in despair
about. about something.'

126
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:44.382
'What if I was to think..'

127
00:10:44.469 --> 00:10:46.863
'...we. all the people
of Howarth'

128
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.084
'at that very moment'

129
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:52.260
'are in their beds.'

130
00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:54.305
'And they too are
listening to the rain'

131
00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:59.746
'and they too are lonely
and sad and afraid.'

132
00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:03.401
'And suddenly I don't feel
I'm alone anymore.'

133
00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:06.274
God is in the rain.

134
00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:09.625
And God is in us.

135
00:11:11.018 --> 00:11:13.150
'But how can we be alone..'

136
00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:18.895
'...when we're all listen
to the rain together.'

137
00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:20.418
'Let us pray.'

138
00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:24.727
What are you going to give them?
There's nothing left but bread.

139
00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:26.642
- Did you hear him?
- Yes. the Weightman.

140
00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:28.557
- Wasn't he--
- Insufferable.

141
00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:30.254
Did you hear
what Reverent Miller said?

142
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:32.387
Meaning of life
in a cup of tea.

143
00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:33.954
What about Weightman's? Um..

144
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:34.998
Yeah. it was alright.

145
00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:37.131
He speaks with such poetry.

146
00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:39.437
- Such truth.
- Which any man can speak.

147
00:11:39.524 --> 00:11:40.917
What I want to know is
can he actually do--

148
00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:42.136
'Do what?'

149
00:11:43.964 --> 00:11:45.617
Ah..

150
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.184
An empty plate.

151
00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:52.407
Sorry. I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

152
00:11:52.494 --> 00:11:54.235
Ah. Mr. William Weightman.

153
00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:00.502
Do any of you
actually speak English?

154
00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.417
I do.

155
00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:04.419
'I mean..'

156
00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:07.857
'This is Emily. Anne.
and Charlotte.'

157
00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:10.207
'I'm Charlotte.'

158
00:12:10.294 --> 00:12:12.775
'God bless you all.'

159
00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:14.298
Your sermon was very--

160
00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:16.910
'Oh. I. was it too much?'

161
00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:18.607
I. uh..

162
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:20.696
Actually. I. what I thought
halfway through. I. uh..

163
00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:22.437
I planned to be
a lot more eloquent.

164
00:12:22.524 --> 00:12:24.700
But. uh. when you get up there
you just..

165
00:12:24.787 --> 00:12:26.354
'Nature is always an
inspiration.'

166
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:28.312
'Yes. nature was wonderful.'

167
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.272
Thank you. Thank you.

168
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:34.971
Though. Jove.
he's very dramatic..

169
00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:36.756
'...in any way for joke.'

170
00:12:36.843 --> 00:12:39.236
'The rain was a good choice.'

171
00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:40.977
'Thank you.'

172
00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:43.110
I do wonder though.

173
00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:47.157
How does God squeeze himself
into all that rain?

174
00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:48.768
Won't he get wet?

175
00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:54.774
- Please. the humanities?
- Yes.

176
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:57.907
- The poetry. painting. music.
- 'Exactly--'

177
00:12:57.994 --> 00:13:00.605
These are the very air
that our society breathes

178
00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:03.870
rather than destroy us.
Reverend Miller.

179
00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:06.655
Oh. here they are.

180
00:13:06.742 --> 00:13:08.918
I return home
to find my poor father

181
00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:11.965
overrun with the entire clergy
of Yorkshire

182
00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:14.445
'and not a pot
of tea to be seen.'

183
00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:17.405
And my sisters holding back
the new curate in the kitchen.

184
00:13:18.754 --> 00:13:20.103
Branwell Bronte.
How do you do. sir?

185
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.235
William Weightman.

186
00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:22.671
Your brother has been accepted

187
00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:25.892
into the Royal Academy of Arts.
girls. eh.

188
00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:30.635
- 'Congratulations.'
- Thank you. Thank you.

189
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.641
- 'That was wonderful.'
- 'Well done.'

190
00:14:05.322 --> 00:14:07.020
She's asking papa
if she might have a friend

191
00:14:07.107 --> 00:14:09.283
come stay in the spring.

192
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.937
A friend?

193
00:14:11.024 --> 00:14:12.460
- Here?
- From the school.

194
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.637
Oh.

195
00:14:19.423 --> 00:14:21.121
Branwell
at the Royal Academy of Arts.

196
00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.557
Can you believe it?

197
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.821
Papa may not approve
of a visitor.

198
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:29.303
You know what he's like.

199
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.961
And you're off to become
a wonderful teacher.

200
00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:38.355
Yes.

201
00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:41.141
'Anne. Emily. come to bed.'

202
00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:43.056
Coming.

203
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:45.493
- Captain Sneaky's tonight. aye?
- Ah..

204
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:51.064
Perhaps we should leave
our stories for a while.

205
00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:53.153
What?

206
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.678
Charlotte says that stories
like that are for children.

207
00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.071
She needn't know.

208
00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:01.204
We could sneak down tonight.
play it toge--

209
00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:04.338
No. we're not
children anymore. Em.

210
00:15:05.948 --> 00:15:08.603
I like to play
these games with you..

211
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.607
...write these stories.
but..

212
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:15.001
But what?

213
00:15:15.088 --> 00:15:19.483
Sometimes.
I think you actually believe--

214
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.398
Yes?

215
00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.926
Come on.
She's waiting.

216
00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:45.945
Do you ever miss mother?

217
00:15:53.648 --> 00:15:56.651
We agreed not to talk of her.
didn't we?

218
00:15:56.738 --> 00:15:57.913
Yes.

219
00:15:59.436 --> 00:16:01.264
But don't you dream of her?

220
00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:08.228
I don't dream at all now.

221
00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:12.014
A waste of good sleep.

222
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:17.759
Besides..

223
00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:19.717
...we should not
dwell in the past.

224
00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:23.721
It's the future
we must live for.

225
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:29.727
Hmm?

226
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.702
I hear you're going to join
your sister at the school

227
00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:49.399
to study. Ms. Emily.

228
00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:56.406
- Yes.
- Well. that'd be lovely.

229
00:16:56.493 --> 00:16:58.191
Here you are.

230
00:16:58.278 --> 00:16:59.670
Thank you.

231
00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:04.110
Does everyone in Howarth know
that I'm going to that school?

232
00:17:04.197 --> 00:17:05.459
Is there applied mail
your friend Ellen?

233
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:06.764
Yes.

234
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:08.027
And this.

235
00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:10.681
From Mr. Weightman.

236
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.989
One to each of us.

237
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.561
Valentines!

238
00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:21.605
In French!

239
00:17:22.954 --> 00:17:25.305
Look. little sachet of seeds.

240
00:17:25.392 --> 00:17:27.046
- Rose seeds.
- Is he here?

241
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:28.395
Is Mr. Weightman here?

242
00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:30.179
He's gone over to
Keith's for the afternoon.

243
00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:31.702
Mrs. Bateman died.

244
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:32.921
Oh. how lovely.

245
00:17:36.185 --> 00:17:37.317
Look.

246
00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:41.364
- Going to Howarth.
- Is that so?

247
00:17:42.887 --> 00:17:44.454
You know it so.

248
00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:51.983
That's very kind thing to say.
Ms. Bronte.

249
00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:55.944
Well. it's the truth.

250
00:17:56.031 --> 00:18:00.514
'And I always speak the truth.'

251
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:01.776
I just want to
stay in my bedroom

252
00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.343
until your friend Ellen goes.

253
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.301
- For three days?
- 'You know what I'm like.'

254
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:07.347
Can't you see
how that'll be perceived?

255
00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:09.000
How rude. how strange--

256
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.002
Or you can tell her
I've gone away for a few days.

257
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.788
No. that. no. that's insane!

258
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:16.399
I won't do it. Charlotte.
I won't.

259
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.184
You know I don't like
to meet new people.

260
00:18:22.623 --> 00:18:24.494
How are you going to get on
with your life if you're so--

261
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:26.496
He doesn't care about you.
you know.

262
00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:27.715
Pardon?

263
00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:29.934
The new curate.

264
00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:32.241
- Weightman.
- Take that back.

265
00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:36.767
He's not to be trusted.

266
00:18:36.854 --> 00:18:39.118
He is a dear friend.

267
00:18:43.252 --> 00:18:44.427
You wait and see.

268
00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:46.690
If you give me her hand.

269
00:18:46.777 --> 00:18:48.039
Just. please. Mr. Weightman.

270
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.172
- I'm sure we can manag--
- Oh. Oh.

271
00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:52.522
- Ellen.
- Breathe. Breathe. Ms. Nussey.

272
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:54.394
- 'Mr. Weightman. honestly--'
- 'No. it's absolutely fine.'

273
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.352
- 'I have it. I have it.'
- 'Should I go?'

274
00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:58.485
If you. you step back.
if you. if you step back--

275
00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:00.313
- Oh. gosh.
- You could've used my knee.

276
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.531
- 'I'm not so sure of it.'
- 'Whoo!'

277
00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:03.577
No one push her.
No one push her.

278
00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:05.970
'Let go of her hand
and then if you use my knee--'

279
00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:09.322
Yes. I. I'm going to jump.
I'm going to go. I'm going to..

280
00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.848
- Well done.
- Thank you.

281
00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:15.719
Thank you.

282
00:19:15.806 --> 00:19:17.678
'What small hands you have.
Ms. Nussey.'

283
00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:20.420
Oh. thank you. Mr. Weightman.

284
00:19:20.507 --> 00:19:21.856
Yeah. my mother could
wear the gloves

285
00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:24.859
'of a four year old girl.
So they say.'

286
00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:29.733
- Come on.
- I think it's going to rain.

287
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.866
- 'I'll make it easy for you.'
- 'Thank you.'

288
00:19:31.953 --> 00:19:35.043
Oh. dear. Do you think it
will rain. Mr. Weightman?

289
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.481
'No. it should hold
a while longer. Ms. Nussey.'

290
00:19:41.441 --> 00:19:42.703
'Sorry.'

291
00:19:46.576 --> 00:19:49.623
Ellen. did have a bit of trouble
getting over that wall?

292
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.581
I'm pretty sure
I just felt a drop.

293
00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:52.930
- Me too!
- So did we!

294
00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:55.890
No. No. It will halt.

295
00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.721
This tree. Ladies.
shelter under this tree.

296
00:20:13.168 --> 00:20:15.431
- This tree isn't helping.
- No. it isn't.

297
00:20:19.087 --> 00:20:20.654
This is not working at all.

298
00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:25.528
'Come on. On with it. troops.'

299
00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:27.182
Charge!

300
00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:30.359
Come on. Charlotte.
All the way to battle!

301
00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:10.573
Sorry.

302
00:21:15.752 --> 00:21:18.451
Look. they don't
like the rain.

303
00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:21.062
- The feel of it.
- The sound of it.

304
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:22.585
The smell of it.

305
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.982
From now on we shall call him
Ms. Celia Amelia.

306
00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:29.549
- I'm a fool.
- No. you're not.

307
00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:32.334
But I'd rather be a fool
than not live at all.

308
00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:34.510
You're an embarrassment to us.

309
00:21:34.597 --> 00:21:36.077
Do you know what they
call you in the village?

310
00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:37.861
- Stop it. Charlotte.
- No!

311
00:21:37.948 --> 00:21:41.604
They call you The Strange One.
And you are.

312
00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:43.780
Mother would be ashamed
to see who you've become.

313
00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:45.869
Every time I come home
I see more and more

314
00:21:45.956 --> 00:21:47.262
of what you're becoming.

315
00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.178
I won't let you drag me down.
I won't!

316
00:21:50.265 --> 00:21:52.136
I'm going to make
something of myself.

317
00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:56.097
Charlotte.

318
00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:02.233
- Please talk--
- Please--

319
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.105
- Please talk.
- Please share.

320
00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:05.846
- Please.
- Please.

321
00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:07.151
Very well.

322
00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:12.461
- He always does that?
- Does he?

323
00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:18.685
- Here we go.
- This is a good story.

324
00:22:18.772 --> 00:22:20.208
Oh. no.

325
00:22:27.084 --> 00:22:30.914
Now. this mask which you see
before you..

326
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:34.265
And you may pass it amongst
yourselves if you wish.

327
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:40.837
Was given to my dear deceased
wife on our wedding day.

328
00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:43.274
But the card was never
found and so we never found out

329
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:46.190
who gave us
such a mysterious gift.

330
00:22:46.277 --> 00:22:49.237
And then we discovered
Aunt Branwell had bought it

331
00:22:49.324 --> 00:22:51.761
on a drunken summer evening--

332
00:22:51.848 --> 00:22:55.548
Branwell. you naughty child.
It is not true.

333
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.119
It has long been a plaything
of my children. Mr. Weightman

334
00:23:02.206 --> 00:23:04.948
'who pretended that it would
give them magical powers'

335
00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:07.342
'transforming them into
all the characters'

336
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:12.042
'of Shakespeare and the Bible.'

337
00:23:12.129 --> 00:23:15.698
'Although I do remember
thinking at the time'

338
00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:19.136
'that that may not be entirely
appropriate in the eyes of God.'

339
00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:30.321
I'm afraid as a Christian
and a clergymen

340
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.062
I cannot condone such acts.

341
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:34.587
Oh. Mr. Weightman.
it's just a bit of fun.

342
00:23:34.674 --> 00:23:37.154
- No!
- My friend. come here.

343
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:38.939
No. no. no. no. no.

344
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:41.855
Nothing you say. sir.
shall persuade me. Nothing.

345
00:23:46.729 --> 00:23:50.951
D-d-do you.
do you like cake?

346
00:24:01.091 --> 00:24:02.484
Ah.

347
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:04.617
Do you like cake so much

348
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:06.183
that you want
everybody to eat it?

349
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.708
Yes. Let's all eat cake!

350
00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:11.058
- Are you Marie Antoinette?
- <i>Oui!</i>

351
00:24:12.668 --> 00:24:15.889
'Excellent. Ms. Bronte.'

352
00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:18.979
Well. I say we may use up
the London stage. Charlotte.

353
00:24:19.066 --> 00:24:21.547
Oh. I'm sure that honor
belongs to you. Ellen dear.

354
00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:23.026
'Should we call a close?'

355
00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:25.159
Well. but Emily hasn't
had a turn.

356
00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:26.508
Oh. no.

357
00:24:26.595 --> 00:24:28.292
- No.
- Oh. come on. Em. Last one.

358
00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:30.207
- Everyone else had a turn.
- I don't want to.

359
00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:31.948
Yes. if she doesn't want to

360
00:24:32.035 --> 00:24:34.124
and really.
she wouldn't be any good.

361
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:36.605
Hmm.

362
00:24:39.652 --> 00:24:41.044
- Give it to me.
- Do you know who--

363
00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:42.481
Yes. give it here.

364
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:51.272
Now just wait until someone
comes to you.

365
00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:00.281
'Who are you?'

366
00:25:00.368 --> 00:25:01.935
Still me. I'm sorry.

367
00:25:02.022 --> 00:25:03.110
- For the love of God.
- It's getting late. Can--

368
00:25:03.197 --> 00:25:05.286
Shh. Please.

369
00:25:05.373 --> 00:25:06.896
It can be anyone.
A queen. pirate--

370
00:25:06.983 --> 00:25:08.376
She's too shy.

371
00:25:08.463 --> 00:25:09.551
She shouldn't be
made to do it.

372
00:25:09.638 --> 00:25:10.813
She's not shy.
she just needs some--

373
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.206
Everybody's had a turn.

374
00:25:12.293 --> 00:25:15.035
Yes. everybody's had a turn.
it's her--

375
00:25:15.122 --> 00:25:16.515
It's not for you to say.
Mr. Weightman.

376
00:25:16.602 --> 00:25:18.038
It isn't for you to say and--

377
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:19.518
'Children.'

378
00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:27.700
Who are you?

379
00:25:29.092 --> 00:25:30.659
I cannot stay long.

380
00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:32.705
Where did you come from?

381
00:25:32.792 --> 00:25:35.490
- From the dark.
- Here we go.

382
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.405
It's so cold outside.

383
00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:39.189
I'm glad to be in here with you.

384
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.192
Where did you come from?

385
00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:47.197
I'm afraid it will frighten you
if I tell you.

386
00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:53.552
Why would we be afraid?

387
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.557
Don't you know who I am?

388
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:02.909
Who are you?

389
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:04.563
I lived here not long ago.

390
00:26:05.651 --> 00:26:07.827
And I knew you all.

391
00:26:10.438 --> 00:26:11.874
Emily.

392
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:13.484
I can see through this mask that
Emily is wearing.

393
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:15.835
'I can see Charlotte.'

394
00:26:15.922 --> 00:26:18.925
'And Branwell. and Anne.'

395
00:26:19.012 --> 00:26:21.318
You all look so lovely.
my angels.

396
00:26:24.931 --> 00:26:26.280
Who are you?

397
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:30.501
Who are you?

398
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:36.029
Don't you know me. child?

399
00:26:38.945 --> 00:26:40.207
Mother.

400
00:26:40.903 --> 00:26:43.384
Mother.

401
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:45.473
- Stop it. Emily.
- Please. stop. Please. stop.

402
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.345
- Please. stop.
- 'Please don't be afraid.'

403
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:51.566
I waited so long
to see you all my children.

404
00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:53.655
- Mother.
- What can we do. mama?

405
00:26:53.742 --> 00:26:55.309
'I worry so much. my children.'

406
00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:57.528
We miss you so.
we try to be good.

407
00:26:57.616 --> 00:27:00.227
- Branwell.
- Mother.

408
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:04.535
You hold yourself still. child.
Hold yourself to the ground.

409
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:05.885
Yes. mother.

410
00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:08.061
- Mother.
- Anne.

411
00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:10.541
'Dear. sweet one.
you are alright.'

412
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.413
I feel you now.

413
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.067
Charlotte.

414
00:27:14.154 --> 00:27:16.025
Little mother.
where are you darling child?

415
00:27:16.112 --> 00:27:17.418
'I want so much for you to be--'

416
00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:18.854
Mother. I try. I try to be good.

417
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:20.551
And Emily..

418
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:23.598
Tell Emily that when she is
lonely

419
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:25.774
she wants .

420
00:27:38.352 --> 00:27:40.659
They're here.

421
00:27:40.746 --> 00:27:42.922
- Who's here?
- They've come to take me back.

422
00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:44.619
- 'Oh. my God.'
- Mama.

423
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:47.100
I've come to warn you.
The mask will break.

424
00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:49.668
The mask is not your friend.
it will break you.

425
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:52.496
Every night I watch you
and cry that my children won't..

426
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:55.151
'...someone
will wear the mask.'

427
00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:58.198
'They cannot breathe!
They cannot breathe!'

428
00:27:58.285 --> 00:28:00.417
- They're coming out.
- Get the mask off!

429
00:28:00.504 --> 00:28:02.289
Let me see!

430
00:28:04.073 --> 00:28:06.119
'Please. children.
you have to let me go.'

431
00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:07.642
Mama!

432
00:28:09.862 --> 00:28:10.950
Mama!

433
00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:13.735
'Mama!'

434
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:19.915
Take the mask off her!

435
00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:22.526
Let me speak to them.

436
00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:26.922
- Mama.
- Mama!

437
00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:30.230
- 'Come back.'
- How dare you. Ms. Bronte?

438
00:28:30.317 --> 00:28:31.492
How dare you?

439
00:28:31.579 --> 00:28:33.059
- We love you. mama!
- Come back!

440
00:28:33.146 --> 00:28:35.278
We love you!

441
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:36.540
'Come back.'

442
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.675
- Please come back.
- Mama!

443
00:28:40.762 --> 00:28:42.721
- We love you so--
- 'What has happened?'

444
00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:45.724
What has happened?

445
00:29:37.384 --> 00:29:39.299
Remember to keep still.
everyone.

446
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.265
Bye-bye. love.

447
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:53.661
- Thank you.
- And good luck.

448
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.801
We expect great things.

449
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:50.256
'There's something
about my spirit'

450
00:31:50.343 --> 00:31:52.649
'which cannot be
contained within a brush.'

451
00:31:52.736 --> 00:31:55.914
'The visions in my head
are too vivid. too large'

452
00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:57.437
'to fill a mere canvas.'

453
00:31:57.524 --> 00:32:00.266
'And it is with words. papa'

454
00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:02.616
'that I will truly
find my vocation.'

455
00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:05.401
But the money?

456
00:32:09.362 --> 00:32:12.408
Anne will go with Charlotte
to the school in the morning.

457
00:32:12.495 --> 00:32:16.064
Rest tomorrow we will decide
how to proceed.

458
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:18.980
I will do better
and be better. sir.

459
00:32:23.854 --> 00:32:27.728
'When I'm gone.
you'll need to..'

460
00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:30.774
'You must find a way
to make yourself useful.'

461
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:32.776
'To papa. to the family.'

462
00:32:34.517 --> 00:32:37.042
'I know it's difficult
for you. this life..'

463
00:32:39.174 --> 00:32:42.351
'...but try not to be
a burden. Emily Jane.'

464
00:32:42.438 --> 00:32:44.527
'You must avoid that
at all cost.'

465
00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.106
Come on.

466
00:32:58.193 --> 00:33:00.456
- Pardon?
- Get dressed.

467
00:33:00.543 --> 00:33:01.980
We're going out.

468
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:05.113
Breathe in all that fresh air.

469
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.593
Have you ever felt so alive?

470
00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:23.436
Oh. and I nearly lost my life
in a fight.

471
00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:24.785
A fight?

472
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:26.308
I was doubled up on the ground.

473
00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:28.136
Somebody's foot kicking
into my stomach

474
00:33:28.223 --> 00:33:30.921
I could feel it almost
connecting with my backbone.

475
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:33.141
And then. nothing.

476
00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:36.710
- Gosh.
- Should we sit?

477
00:33:36.797 --> 00:33:38.451
Mm.

478
00:33:38.538 --> 00:33:41.584
And then I realized
what I wanted to do.

479
00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:43.760
Like a gas light
flaring up in me.

480
00:33:43.847 --> 00:33:46.067
And all this
has opened my eyes.

481
00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:49.723
I mean. who was that before?
Who was I?

482
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.203
I do not know.

483
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.293
You alright there?

484
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.642
Yes.

485
00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:58.253
And what do you want to do?

486
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.429
- Hmm?
- With your life.

487
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.563
I don't know.

488
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.521
That's not very good. is it?

489
00:34:05.608 --> 00:34:08.394
- I am to write.
- To write?

490
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:11.179
Yes. And what do you think
I should write about?

491
00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:12.963
What?

492
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:16.489
I shall take from
my own life. The ordinary.

493
00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:19.492
And make it extraordinary.

494
00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:22.321
But why?

495
00:34:22.408 --> 00:34:23.974
The great Shelley
says that God surrounds

496
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.281
each artist with
different things.

497
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:30.024
Good. bad.
beautiful. and ugly.

498
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:31.895
And that there's
design in that.

499
00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:35.029
There's reason in that.

500
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.293
I was going to be teacher.

501
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.731
As Charlotte.

502
00:34:41.818 --> 00:34:43.646
I think papa
would have liked that.

503
00:34:48.782 --> 00:34:50.175
What do you think?

504
00:34:50.262 --> 00:34:52.046
Pardon?

505
00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:54.570
What do you think yourself?

506
00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:00.620
I never wanted
to be teacher.

507
00:35:03.797 --> 00:35:07.801
I just did it because I thought
then papa would love me

508
00:35:07.888 --> 00:35:09.629
as he loves Charlotte.

509
00:35:11.718 --> 00:35:14.764
Is there something
wrong with me. brother?

510
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:16.940
Hmm?

511
00:35:17.027 --> 00:35:18.246
Charlotte says
all the people in the village

512
00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:19.726
call me The Strange One.

513
00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:23.730
Am I strange?

514
00:35:23.817 --> 00:35:25.645
Everyone's strange if you look
at them for long enough.

515
00:35:25.732 --> 00:35:28.256
No. it's just
Charlotte's always right.

516
00:35:28.343 --> 00:35:29.736
Charlotte?

517
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.348
What?

518
00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:35.176
She's the embodiment of a lie.

519
00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:38.092
Well. surely you must know this.

520
00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:42.444
Father's love.
that's all she wants.

521
00:35:42.531 --> 00:35:46.796
So she's put away her
stories and her dreams..

522
00:35:46.883 --> 00:35:48.102
...her magic.

523
00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:49.625
You shouldn't say that.

524
00:35:49.712 --> 00:35:51.845
- Why not?
- Because she's our sister.

525
00:35:51.932 --> 00:35:53.542
We're supposed to
love and cherish her.

526
00:35:53.629 --> 00:35:56.589
Do you think she loves
and cherishes you

527
00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:58.547
who you really are?

528
00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:10.733
Do you think
I could be a writer?

529
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:14.998
Perhaps.

530
00:36:15.085 --> 00:36:16.870
You'd have to show me
something first though.

531
00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:20.656
I have lots of stories.

532
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.878
- Should we go back?
- Mm.

533
00:36:30.449 --> 00:36:31.754
What's this?

534
00:36:31.841 --> 00:36:34.366
Hmm? Oh. yes.

535
00:36:34.453 --> 00:36:36.063
My creed.

536
00:36:38.892 --> 00:36:40.328
Don't let Aunt B see that.

537
00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:42.809
I don't care
if she sees it or not.

538
00:36:42.896 --> 00:36:44.506
"Freedom in thought."

539
00:36:44.593 --> 00:36:46.508
Mm. yes. but you can't
say it though.

540
00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:48.162
You have to shout it.

541
00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:50.904
- Freedom in thought!
- What are you doing?

542
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:53.689
- You try.
- No. you're being silly.

543
00:36:53.776 --> 00:36:56.126
I'm deadly serious.
Come on.

544
00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:58.825
No. someone might hear us.

545
00:36:58.912 --> 00:37:02.307
Oh. yeah. They might.

546
00:37:02.394 --> 00:37:07.312
Freedom in thought!
Freedom in thought!

547
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:09.662
Try it.

548
00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:12.708
- Freedom in thought!
- Oh. pathetic attempt.

549
00:37:12.795 --> 00:37:15.494
Freedom in thought!
Come on. really get behind it.

550
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:18.279
- Freedom in thought!
- Come on. Give us some welly.

551
00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:20.890
Freedom in thought!

552
00:37:20.977 --> 00:37:23.676
Freedom in thought!

553
00:37:23.763 --> 00:37:26.200
Emily Jane.
I think Reverend Miller

554
00:37:26.287 --> 00:37:27.419
might have just
fallen off his chair

555
00:37:27.506 --> 00:37:28.724
in the rectory.

556
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:29.812
Good.

557
00:37:29.899 --> 00:37:31.031
Freedom in thought!

558
00:37:31.118 --> 00:37:32.380
Freedom in thought!

559
00:37:32.467 --> 00:37:33.512
Freedom in thought!

560
00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:34.861
Freedom in thought!

561
00:37:34.948 --> 00:37:36.079
Freedom in thought!

562
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:38.691
Freedom in thought!

563
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:56.099
- It was...very well executed.
- Executed?

564
00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:36.461
Mr. Weightman will be
tutoring you in French.

565
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.986
'You will start this morning.'

566
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.597
Thank you. father.

567
00:41:05.027 --> 00:41:06.507
Blindly?

568
00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:33.360
Hmm.

569
00:42:00.953 --> 00:42:02.215
There's a great deal
of difference.

570
00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:50.698
Weightman was advertising
blind faith today.

571
00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:53.571
- While speaking French?
- Yes.

572
00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:55.442
- Very clever that one.
- Mm.

573
00:42:57.444 --> 00:42:59.272
He says it's the only way
to the afterlife.

574
00:43:01.927 --> 00:43:03.798
He's just drumming up business.

575
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:06.888
Without focus on questioning
sheep. what is a shepherd?

576
00:43:16.376 --> 00:43:19.814
'So Jove is. is asking why he'

577
00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:22.164
'an-an upright man.
a good man..'

578
00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:32.087
And Jove accuses God
of. of being. of being unjust.

579
00:43:32.174 --> 00:43:34.742
- 'Shh.'
- 'Then afterward..'

580
00:43:38.964 --> 00:43:40.748
Where is he?

581
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:45.187
Go and fetch him.
will you. Emily Jane?

582
00:43:45.274 --> 00:43:48.451
I'm sure that I recognize
this photo from somewhere.

583
00:43:48.538 --> 00:43:50.628
The snake from Garden of Eden.

584
00:43:54.762 --> 00:43:58.113
Oh. Emily.
Save me from these wolfs.

585
00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:04.163
Gentlemen. may I present
my sister Ms. Emily Bronte.

586
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.166
'I know your father well.'

587
00:44:07.253 --> 00:44:10.386
Sir Ralph Delaney
of Delaney lodge.

588
00:44:10.473 --> 00:44:13.085
How do you do. young lady?

589
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.958
Aunt says to come home
for supper now.

590
00:44:17.045 --> 00:44:19.004
'Mm. just come and sit
with me for a minute'

591
00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:20.527
while I finish my drink. yeah?

592
00:44:20.614 --> 00:44:23.225
We are discussing
the ensuing election

593
00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:26.315
Or should I say
the rat race of humans scum.

594
00:44:26.402 --> 00:44:28.578
Yeah.

595
00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:30.929
- 'Would you miss?'
- Unh.

596
00:44:31.016 --> 00:44:32.844
Oh. come on. Em.

597
00:44:32.931 --> 00:44:36.674
Here. Have some of mine
first to see if you like it.

598
00:44:50.209 --> 00:44:51.819
'Get the glasses. Chevy.'

599
00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:53.952
I wonder what they argue
so much about.

600
00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:55.518
That's what I said.

601
00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:57.433
'It is a wonder
they do not chase each other'

602
00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.351
around and around
and around the house.

603
00:45:02.438 --> 00:45:05.267
'I'll tell you neither of them
will get my vote.'

604
00:45:05.354 --> 00:45:07.269
'Sir Ralph. you lie like a rug.'

605
00:45:07.356 --> 00:45:09.576
'You have not voted
since Julius Caesar.'

606
00:45:13.798 --> 00:45:17.018
'Tonight be fair. sir.
Tonight be fair.'

607
00:45:17.105 --> 00:45:19.151
'I don't trust any of them.'

608
00:46:26.914 --> 00:46:28.611
- 'That one was promising.'
- 'Lovely. Emily.'

609
00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:31.136
- 'Yes. well done.'
- Thank you. Reverend Miller.

610
00:46:31.223 --> 00:46:33.442
Doesn't she play beautifully?

611
00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:35.749
Oh. yes.
It's intoxicating.

612
00:46:58.119 --> 00:47:00.861
Perhaps...we should
finish early today.

613
00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:04.952
Seems that last night's
entertainment

614
00:47:05.039 --> 00:47:07.520
has exhausted your powers
of concentration.

615
00:47:15.658 --> 00:47:17.660
Ms. Bronte.
your brother can be unstable--

616
00:47:17.747 --> 00:47:19.575
Do not speak of my brother.

617
00:47:19.662 --> 00:47:21.751
I see that he's becoming
a true friend for you.

618
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.319
A blessing in this wasteland
but I worry that

619
00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:26.887
to be influenced by Branwell
could harm your soul.

620
00:47:26.974 --> 00:47:28.280
If much--

621
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.368
If it is my soul.
it is none of your business

622
00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:31.283
whom it spends time with.

623
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:33.415
And if my home
is a wasteland to you

624
00:47:33.502 --> 00:47:35.548
I suggest you go back to your

625
00:47:35.635 --> 00:47:36.810
we will not miss you.

626
00:47:38.551 --> 00:47:39.726
What is that?

627
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:42.816
What is that?

628
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.220
"Freedom in.."

629
00:48:20.375 --> 00:48:23.117
<i>"O'thy bright eyes</i>
<i>must answer now.</i>

630
00:48:23.204 --> 00:48:24.727
<i>"When reason</i>
<i>with a scornful brow</i>

631
00:48:24.814 --> 00:48:27.208
<i>"is mocking at my overthrow.</i>

632
00:48:27.295 --> 00:48:29.297
<i>O'thy sweet tongue must.."</i>

633
00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:49.361
Come on. it's just up ahead.

634
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:50.623
Where are we going?

635
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.103
Surprise.

636
00:48:57.108 --> 00:48:58.718
Branwell.

637
00:48:58.805 --> 00:49:00.720
'They can't see us. Shh.'

638
00:49:00.807 --> 00:49:02.722
'Sometimes I get so close.
my nose is practically'

639
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:04.811
squashed up against the glass.

640
00:49:06.247 --> 00:49:07.683
What do you think
they're thinking?

641
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.598
Hmm.

642
00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:11.470
The son is thinking..

643
00:49:12.906 --> 00:49:15.169
"...That pudding was delicious.

644
00:49:15.256 --> 00:49:17.780
"When mama and papa are asleep.
I shall snoop downstairs

645
00:49:17.867 --> 00:49:20.131
and gorge myself silly on it."

646
00:49:20.218 --> 00:49:21.654
And he is thinking..

647
00:49:23.047 --> 00:49:25.527
"...What a handsome
fellow I am.

648
00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:27.312
"I'm sure
the cook fancies me.

649
00:49:27.399 --> 00:49:29.314
Why. yesterday I'm certain
she winked at me."

650
00:49:29.401 --> 00:49:30.968
- Cook has a twitchy eye.
- And a wooden leg.

651
00:49:31.055 --> 00:49:33.100
And her hearing will be gone.

652
00:49:33.187 --> 00:49:34.972
And she?

653
00:49:35.059 --> 00:49:37.235
She's beautiful.
isn't she?

654
00:49:37.322 --> 00:49:39.150
Do you think
she married him for his money?

655
00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:42.588
Perhaps she hasn't.

656
00:49:51.597 --> 00:49:52.859
It's alright.

657
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:07.787
Oh. hell. Come on.
Come on. Come on!

658
00:50:07.874 --> 00:50:10.050
'Hey. there they are!'

659
00:50:10.137 --> 00:50:11.573
Branwell. wait.

660
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.445
Wait. Wait.

661
00:50:16.187 --> 00:50:17.623
Come back here!

662
00:50:19.886 --> 00:50:22.019
Branwell. wait for me!
Branwell!

663
00:50:26.849 --> 00:50:27.981
Whoo!

664
00:50:37.686 --> 00:50:39.123
And your brother's room.

665
00:51:13.592 --> 00:51:15.246
I've got some errands
this afternoon.

666
00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:16.986
Could you put the washing
on the line?

667
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:18.423
Yes.

668
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:29.434
Good girl.

669
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:10.274
'...such large crowds gathered
around it.'

670
00:53:12.624 --> 00:53:14.191
'...all the people..'

671
00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:38.954
Ms. Bronte.

672
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:41.087
Miss Bronte.

673
00:53:41.174 --> 00:53:43.132
Are you so lost?

674
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.786
Are you going to tell father?

675
00:53:47.006 --> 00:53:48.529
- Let me look at your face.
- No.

676
00:53:48.616 --> 00:53:49.878
Let me see.

677
00:53:53.055 --> 00:53:55.014
Thank God. Ms. Bronte.

678
00:53:55.101 --> 00:53:57.016
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

679
00:53:57.103 --> 00:53:58.713
I'll kill him
when I find him.

680
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.281
Bran wasn't..

681
00:54:01.368 --> 00:54:03.022
I stole it from him.

682
00:54:04.502 --> 00:54:06.068
You stole it?

683
00:54:06.155 --> 00:54:07.983
Tell father quickly then.

684
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.986
It's the time he'd be spared of
restless night's sheep. sleep.

685
00:54:11.073 --> 00:54:12.597
Oh. I'm sure
you'll be guaranteed

686
00:54:12.684 --> 00:54:14.207
a blissful night's sleep.

687
00:54:16.731 --> 00:54:18.385
Go inside. Go home.

688
00:54:18.472 --> 00:54:19.691
Are you going to tell father?

689
00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:21.083
Are you going to tell..

690
00:54:33.487 --> 00:54:34.923
You're late.

691
00:54:58.338 --> 00:54:59.731
You didn't tell my father.

692
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.169
No. I didn't.

693
00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:05.954
Why not?

694
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:12.613
A mystery.

695
00:55:24.495 --> 00:55:25.887
Should we go back?

696
00:55:27.802 --> 00:55:29.543
We just got here.

697
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.111
I'll be going to bed soon
anyway.

698
00:55:32.198 --> 00:55:34.592
I saw you with Weightman today.

699
00:55:34.679 --> 00:55:38.117
- What?
- I saw you today.

700
00:55:38.204 --> 00:55:39.379
He used to be
the butt of our jokes

701
00:55:39.466 --> 00:55:40.728
and now I see you
walking out with him.

702
00:55:40.815 --> 00:55:42.339
You are drunk. brother.

703
00:55:42.426 --> 00:55:43.905
- What were you talking about?
- There's nothing.

704
00:55:43.992 --> 00:55:46.952
Thinks himself to be an artist.
the way he preaches..

705
00:55:48.432 --> 00:55:49.955
...but he's not.

706
00:55:50.042 --> 00:55:52.174
- You know he looks at you.
- What?

707
00:55:52.261 --> 00:55:55.743
- What are you talking about?
- Look at you. You're blushing.

708
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:58.006
He thinks he has to care for my
soul as to cure it. that's all.

709
00:55:58.093 --> 00:56:00.139
He doesn't care for it.
he wants it.

710
00:56:00.226 --> 00:56:02.402
'And when he realizes
he can't have it'

711
00:56:02.489 --> 00:56:05.579
when he realizes
what you really are..

712
00:56:08.887 --> 00:56:10.279
...he'll be terrified.

713
00:56:15.502 --> 00:56:16.982
Run.

714
00:56:17.069 --> 00:56:18.940
- 'There they are!'
- 'Go!'

715
00:56:19.027 --> 00:56:21.290
- 'Go. go. go!'
- 'Come back here!'

716
00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:30.952
Ah! Run away. Go away. my love.
Go! Go!'

717
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.404
He asked me to fetch you in.

718
00:56:49.014 --> 00:56:50.407
Were you there?

719
00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:53.279
Was it you?

720
00:57:06.466 --> 00:57:09.687
The problems that you arise..

721
00:57:09.774 --> 00:57:12.516
Can you truly do this with
his voice always in your ear?

722
00:57:14.605 --> 00:57:17.129
'I cannot say. Reverend Bronte.
It was dark.'

723
00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:19.740
'The girl was similar
but had such a..'

724
00:57:19.827 --> 00:57:23.440
'...wild looking
or like a gypsy or a beggar.'

725
00:57:23.527 --> 00:57:25.964
'You may not have any
self-restraint'

726
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:28.619
'but you will show some
in this house.'

727
00:57:30.621 --> 00:57:32.666
Was it you. girl?

728
00:57:32.753 --> 00:57:34.799
Were you out tonight spying
into respectable houses

729
00:57:34.886 --> 00:57:37.192
instead of tending to your
prayers because if it were you--

730
00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:41.327
Mr. Linton. if you will allow me
to conduct the questions please.

731
00:57:41.414 --> 00:57:43.895
Now. daughter..

732
00:57:43.982 --> 00:57:46.463
...you will answer truthfully.
Do you understand?

733
00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:48.160
Yes. father.

734
00:57:48.247 --> 00:57:49.640
Did you see Branwell last night?

735
00:57:50.945 --> 00:57:52.730
I saw him at supper.

736
00:57:52.817 --> 00:57:56.124
'But did you see him
after that?'

737
00:57:56.211 --> 00:57:57.169
Yes.

738
00:57:57.256 --> 00:57:58.475
Is it entirely necessary

739
00:57:58.562 --> 00:58:00.302
to subject a young
inexperienced woman--

740
00:58:00.389 --> 00:58:03.001
I think it is. sir. and if she's
as guilty as a brother

741
00:58:03.088 --> 00:58:04.829
there'll be consequences
for her too.

742
00:58:04.916 --> 00:58:08.223
Where did you see him last?

743
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.835
- 'Why does she not speak?'
- 'Where did you see him?'

744
00:58:10.922 --> 00:58:13.490
Do not bring shame
on this house. Emily Jane.

745
00:58:15.143 --> 00:58:16.318
'Speak. girl.'

746
00:58:17.885 --> 00:58:20.279
Did you go with him..

747
00:58:20.366 --> 00:58:23.151
...Emily Jane?

748
00:58:23.238 --> 00:58:26.154
- 'Answer!'
- I-I..

749
00:58:28.766 --> 00:58:30.768
I told him I was tired.

750
00:58:30.855 --> 00:58:32.552
And that it was madness to go
out at such a dark night

751
00:58:32.639 --> 00:58:34.206
and so he left me.

752
00:58:37.035 --> 00:58:38.732
Father. please.

753
00:58:38.819 --> 00:58:40.908
'Very well. Emily Jane.
you can go.'

754
00:58:40.995 --> 00:58:42.780
- Father. please don't hurt him.
- Take her out.

755
00:58:42.867 --> 00:58:44.259
- Branwell. take off your shirt.
- Please--

756
00:58:44.346 --> 00:58:45.739
I don't want her to see
for God's sake.

757
00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:48.307
No. he. don't.
He's already in pain. papa.

758
00:58:48.394 --> 00:58:50.527
He's hurt his leg.
you don't need to hurt him more.

759
00:58:50.614 --> 00:58:51.789
Let go of me!

760
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:55.880
Where are they taking him?

761
00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:57.577
He's to work for Mr. Linton
to make amends.

762
00:58:57.664 --> 00:58:58.883
No.

763
00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:01.276
He's to tutor his son
for amends.

764
00:59:01.363 --> 00:59:03.235
'Oh. come now.'

765
00:59:03.322 --> 00:59:05.629
Branwell! Branwell!

766
00:59:05.716 --> 00:59:06.804
Branwell!

767
01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:36.780
- Take Emily home.
- Yes. sir.

768
01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:41.306
Excuse me.

769
01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:49.140
Ms. Bronte.

770
01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:53.361
Ms. Bronte.

771
01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.194
Ms. Bronte. wait. Your father
said I was to take you--

772
01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:01.674
We'll have to wait in here.

773
01:02:12.946 --> 01:02:15.079
I hope tonight illustrates
once and for all

774
01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:17.168
why your brother is
a dangerous influence.

775
01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:18.473
Because he kissed a woman?

776
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.171
Because he kissed
a married woman.

777
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.652
'Do you know what we
sisters used to call you?'

778
01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:27.221
Celia Amelia.

779
01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:29.528
- Do you know why?
- Why?

780
01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:31.660
Because you're like
a little girl in a ribbon shop.

781
01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.880
This ribbon. no. that ribbon.
You know better than him.

782
01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:35.490
I'm surprised you notice
what I was doing at all.

783
01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.144
You spend most of your time
looking at your feet.

784
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.675
Celia Amelia?

785
01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:54.771
I suppose..

786
01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:58.687
...it's in my nature.

787
01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:02.779
To always want something new.

788
01:03:06.173 --> 01:03:07.740
Don't know why I should be so.

789
01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.698
Why do you always
look at your feet?

790
01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.790
You hear how people talk of me?

791
01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:18.098
I am odd.

792
01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.189
I am an odd fish.

793
01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:25.845
- A fish?
- Mm.

794
01:03:25.932 --> 01:03:28.108
If you take me away from here.
I'll dry up and fade away.

795
01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:31.895
I see.

796
01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:33.331
So I am destined..

797
01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:36.769
...to be stuck here.

798
01:03:38.162 --> 01:03:40.555
In this backwater.

799
01:03:40.642 --> 01:03:41.948
'This pond.'

800
01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:47.998
Oh. yeah. that's very good.

801
01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:52.437
Thank you.

802
01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:11.369
This isn't a poem. Ms. Bronte.

803
01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.289
'Can you hear it?'

804
01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:23.772
What is it?

805
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.518
It's the sea.

806
01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:35.567
- The sea?
- Yeah.

807
01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:41.965
You're like these sea creatures
in deep oceans.

808
01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:48.406
And why would you want
to leave the sea?

809
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.980
That's not what
the sea sounds like.

810
01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:58.285
Yeah.

811
01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:07.686
It's beautiful.

812
01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:50.947
We should. we should stop!

813
01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:55.952
Yes. you like it.

814
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.313
We should stop!

815
01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:26.634
'Come.'

816
01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.028
'Come in. Emily.'

817
01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:40.605
Now. before you speak. Emily..

818
01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.087
...I want you to know.
I know everything.

819
01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:49.309
Father. I can explain.

820
01:06:49.396 --> 01:06:52.225
In youth.
love is a confusing thing.

821
01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.053
- Love?
- 'Yes.'

822
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.229
'It is a natural force
when appropriate.'

823
01:06:56.316 --> 01:06:58.492
I deem this inappropriate.

824
01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:00.059
- Mr. Weightman is--
- Mr. Weightman?

825
01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:05.499
- Branwell must go away.
- Branwell?

826
01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:07.240
'Yes. Branwell must go away
to another po--'

827
01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:08.676
- Another..
- 'Position.'

828
01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.069
'Yes. I have looked into it.'

829
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:12.898
He will be stationmaster
at Luddenden Foot.

830
01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:14.508
'I want you to write
to your sisters'

831
01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:15.727
'and tell them
what has happened.'

832
01:07:15.814 --> 01:07:17.468
Yes.

833
01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:19.818
'We must keep this
in the family.'

834
01:07:19.905 --> 01:07:22.081
Dear Lord.
will there ever be an end

835
01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:23.778
'to the disgrace of my son?'

836
01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:28.653
- 'Emily!'
- Branwell!

837
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:31.917
You scared me.

838
01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.223
No. don't. Don't.

839
01:07:34.702 --> 01:07:35.790
'There's no need to look at me?'

840
01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:38.663
I come back to see your face.

841
01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:40.665
'But why?'

842
01:07:42.449 --> 01:07:43.798
In case I saw something
different.

843
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.236
What would be different?

844
01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:48.934
I-I would die if I saw disgust.

845
01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:49.978
It's just the same.

846
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.593
'Pa will kill you
if he sees you here.'

847
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.681
'I came to give you this.'

848
01:08:01.512 --> 01:08:02.426
'First chapter.'

849
01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:06.343
Well done.

850
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.214
'But you must be brutally
honest.'

851
01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:10.695
Of course.

852
01:08:16.004 --> 01:08:18.616
- I'm sorry. I don't know why--
- 'It doesn't matter.'

853
01:08:18.703 --> 01:08:19.660
I'm happy.

854
01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:24.796
But will you promise me
something while I'm away?

855
01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:25.797
'Of course.'

856
01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.801
'He's not for you. my love.'

857
01:08:33.413 --> 01:08:35.241
- I have to go.
- 'Wait.'

858
01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:36.242
I wanted to..

859
01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.116
'It's a poem.'

860
01:08:41.378 --> 01:08:42.292
I wrote it.

861
01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:46.948
- Thank you. sister.
- 'To say I'm sorry.'

862
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:51.039
You'll start to wonder
where I am.

863
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.084
I'm afraid.

864
01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.223
Be well. my love.

865
01:09:05.358 --> 01:09:07.186
Do you remember the night
I wore the mask?

866
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.974
It was just a story
you were telling.

867
01:09:14.672 --> 01:09:16.152
Yes.

868
01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:19.677
Let me see your face. you idiot.

869
01:09:19.764 --> 01:09:22.201
Let me hold you.. Oh. beautiful.

870
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.555
Lavender.

871
01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.951
Emily Bronte's secret
ingredient.

881

Thank you. my dear.

882
01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.796
Thank you. Ms. Bronte.

883
01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:47.199
- Where to keep the scraps?
- Yes.

884
01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:48.244
You can put them
in that bowl.

And it chose me.

No.

I feel that. too.

I'll further my studies
in French while I'm there.

'Perhaps an idea would be to
take Emily with you.'

improved markedly.'

947

I'm happy here. father.

948
01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:16.899
I don't want to speak French.

949

How dare you be so insolent.
Emily Jane. you will converse.

'Well..'

951
01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:26.490
Sounds like she'll give you
a run for your money.

952
01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:28.100
'Well. think on it.'

953
01:21:28.187 --> 01:21:30.233
I shall have to look
at the finances. of course.

'William!'

957
01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:15.876
Let me in. please.

958
01:24:15.963 --> 01:24:17.052

959
01:24:18.444 --> 01:24:19.402
'Please!'

Let me in. please!'

Mr. Weightman's hosting the new
family for afternoon teas.

962
01:25:35.565 --> 01:25:37.306
Could you make a cake.
Emily Jane?

963
01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:40.613
And you're both expected to pass
the scones and pour the tea.

964
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.920
I'm not feeling very well. aunt.

965
01:25:43.007 --> 01:25:44.530
- 'Emily Jane.'
- I won't do it!

966
01:25:44.617 --> 01:25:46.010
Emily.

967
01:25:46.097 --> 01:25:47.794
Do you want me to speak
to your father?

968
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.557
Emily! There you are.

969
01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:20.653
It's a cake.

970
01:26:22.568 --> 01:26:24.396
Do come in. Ms. Bronte.

971
01:26:24.483 --> 01:26:26.137
I don't know if it's any good.

972
01:26:28.095 --> 01:26:29.314
Hello.

973
01:26:29.401 --> 01:26:30.489
Hello. Hello.

974
01:26:30.576 --> 01:26:31.534
Come. sit. sister.

975
01:26:32.796 --> 01:26:34.711
I cannot stay long.

976
01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:36.278
I think I'm coming down
with something.

977
01:26:36.365 --> 01:26:38.541
Oh. that's a pity.

978
01:26:38.628 --> 01:26:40.151
'It's hard in these
cooler months'

979
01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:41.631
'to hold onto one's vivacity.'

980
01:26:41.718 --> 01:26:43.502
Yes.

981
01:26:43.589 --> 01:26:46.766
Yes. Vivacity is an elusive
thing. Mr. Barker.

982
01:26:49.943 --> 01:26:50.901
Have you been well?

983
01:26:51.815 --> 01:26:54.034
Yes. quite well.

984
01:26:54.121 --> 01:26:55.558
No. I think the weather
is turning.

985
01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:58.125
- Do you not agree. Mr. Barker?
- Like one's nature.

986
01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.867
- Quite right. Ms. Bronte.
- Jonathan.

987
01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:09.267
Do you remember what you said
about your nature?

988
01:27:09.354 --> 01:27:10.660
No. I. um..

989
01:27:14.925 --> 01:27:15.882
Ms. Bronte!

990
01:27:56.445 --> 01:27:58.011
'Mr. Weightman!'

991
01:27:58.098 --> 01:28:00.318
Your sister isn't feeling well
I'm afraid.

992
01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:02.842
What's happened?
What has happened?

993
01:28:06.063 --> 01:28:07.717
We have committed a mortal sin.

994
01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.981
God will not forgive me
for what I've done.

995
01:28:11.068 --> 01:28:12.852
But I must make amends. now you

996
01:28:12.939 --> 01:28:15.812
you'll stay away from me.
from now on. do you hear?

997
01:28:15.899 --> 01:28:16.813
I don't understand.

998
01:28:18.728 --> 01:28:20.904
I will call your father now
if you do not leave at once.

999
01:28:21.687 --> 01:28:22.601
No!

1000
01:28:24.168 --> 01:28:26.518
- That night you wore the mask..
- Pardon?

1001
01:28:26.605 --> 01:28:30.087
The night when I was first here.
you wore the mask.

1002
01:28:30.174 --> 01:28:31.523
- We were playing the game.
- Yes.

1003
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.091
And you.. We..

1004
01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:36.311
We.. Did you..?

1005
01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.270
Did I what?

1006
01:28:40.967 --> 01:28:42.926
Did I what?!

1007
01:28:43.013 --> 01:28:43.970
- No. sorry!
- No!

1008
01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:49.411
Now I think there's something
ungodly in you..

1009
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.502
...in your writing.

1010
01:28:53.589 --> 01:28:55.504
In your poetry. I..

1011
01:28:55.591 --> 01:28:57.201
...I feel it
when we're together.

1012
01:28:57.288 --> 01:28:59.769
- Listen. I..
- That's not true.

1013
01:28:59.856 --> 01:29:02.032
I have stand in here.

1014
01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:03.599
I'm-I'm respected over here.

1015
01:29:03.686 --> 01:29:05.818
I. uh. I have worked to do.

1016
01:29:08.647 --> 01:29:10.040
If you don't obey my wishes

1017
01:29:10.127 --> 01:29:11.433
I will tell your father
all that you've done.

1018
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.522
All of it.
Do you understand me?

1019
01:29:13.609 --> 01:29:15.219
Please. don't do that!

1020
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.788
- Go.
- Please!

1021
01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:19.919
- Ple..
- Go!

1022
01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.315
Go!

1023
01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.342
You look tired.

1024
01:29:51.429 --> 01:29:54.127
It's very busy at the parsonage.

1025
01:29:54.214 --> 01:29:56.652
I haven't heard from Anne.

1026
01:29:56.739 --> 01:29:58.828
Charlotte's got a teaching
position in Brussels.

1027
01:29:58.915 --> 01:30:01.004
Bully for her.

1028
01:30:01.091 --> 01:30:03.398
- Father and Aunt B.
- 'Fine.'

1029
01:30:05.748 --> 01:30:06.662
'How's Weightman?'

1030
01:30:08.838 --> 01:30:09.752
He's well.

1031
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.886
- Did you get my second chapter?
- Yes.

1032
01:30:13.973 --> 01:30:17.237
'What did you think of it?'

1033
01:30:17.324 --> 01:30:18.500
What did you think of it?

1034
01:30:18.587 --> 01:30:19.501
Honestly?

1035
01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:27.073
Well. it's..

1036
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.776
It's the most self important
overwritten piece of writing.

1037
01:30:33.863 --> 01:30:36.256
And. lazy.

1038
01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:37.867
I've never read such
lazy writing.

1039
01:30:39.216 --> 01:30:41.392
- Pardon?
- It's unclear.

1040
01:30:41.479 --> 01:30:44.134
I couldn't understand what was
going on half the time.

1041
01:30:44.221 --> 01:30:46.005
And the thing that really
upsets me is that

1042
01:30:46.092 --> 01:30:47.964
you obviously don't have any
perspective on what a truly

1043
01:30:48.051 --> 01:30:50.314
terrible.
terrible writer you are.

1044
01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:52.490
'Honestly. it's laughable.'

1045
01:30:52.577 --> 01:30:54.971
'Your characters wander
about aimlessly.'

1046
01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:57.974
Soppy descriptions of hills
and mountains.

1047
01:30:58.061 --> 01:30:59.889
And your lead characters have
about as much depth as one of

1048
01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:03.240
your sketches. which is
so obviously stolen from Byron.

1049
01:31:03.327 --> 01:31:05.024
And it seemed as difficult
for you to avoid a cliche

1050
01:31:05.111 --> 01:31:07.679
as it is for you to
avoid a drink.

1051
01:31:07.766 --> 01:31:09.899
And that's saying something.
because you sit here

1052
01:31:09.986 --> 01:31:13.642
off your head most of the time
on what is it this week. opium?

1053
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:15.426
Gin?

1054
01:31:15.513 --> 01:31:17.036
Rum. is it rum?

1055
01:31:17.123 --> 01:31:19.038
You sit here in this hole

1056
01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:21.040
at your little desk
with your little bed

1057
01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:22.912
all hopeful and perfect
about the future

1058
01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:24.522
and all the lovely things
that will happen to you!

1059
01:31:24.609 --> 01:31:26.306
It's pathetic!

1060
01:31:26.393 --> 01:31:29.048
I don't know how you
get through the day.

1061
01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:33.792
Please.

1062
01:31:33.879 --> 01:31:36.926
'Oh. that's right.
We know. don't we?'

1063
01:31:41.974 --> 01:31:43.019
I have to go.

1064
01:31:46.022 --> 01:31:47.414
I hope you fall in love someday.

1065
01:31:51.593 --> 01:31:54.204
So I can be like you?

1066
01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:57.250
'So you can bleed.
like the rest of us.'

1067
01:31:58.861 --> 01:32:00.515
I'll never be like you.

1068
01:32:00.602 --> 01:32:02.386
You are me.

1069
01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:04.693
Mystic as well as a psychic now?
You seem a little

1070
01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:06.477
'over qualified
for your current employment.'

1071
01:32:06.564 --> 01:32:08.697
Let's not fight. I'm-I'm so glad
that you've come.

1072
01:32:08.784 --> 01:32:10.655
- I have to go.
- But y-you just got here.

1073
01:32:10.742 --> 01:32:12.527
- This is from father. Money!
- No. No. I--

1074
01:32:12.614 --> 01:32:15.051
- No. no. I don't want--
- Take it.

1075
01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:19.229
You'll need something to buy
whatever it is you need now.

1076
01:32:23.494 --> 01:32:24.713
Yes. of course.

1077
01:32:26.366 --> 01:32:27.324
Thank you.

1078
01:32:32.938 --> 01:32:35.114
Em. did you really think
that about my writing?

1079
01:32:37.639 --> 01:32:38.640
I-is it..

1080
01:32:45.864 --> 01:32:48.258
Well. thank you.

1081
01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:51.087
Alright. I will. I will try
and do better from now on.

1082
01:32:51.174 --> 01:32:53.872
I'll. uh.. Alright?

1083
01:32:53.959 --> 01:32:54.917
Really will.

1084
01:34:25.094 --> 01:34:26.008
Shall we begin?

1085
01:34:41.763 --> 01:34:43.112
Turn to page 71.

1086
01:34:55.037 --> 01:34:58.649
There's a French verb tense

1087
01:34:58.736 --> 01:35:00.825
for past participle negative.

1088
01:35:00.912 --> 01:35:03.262
- We haven't covered yet.
- Hmm.

1089
01:35:03.349 --> 01:35:05.090
Yes. it's quite tricky.
isn't it?

1090
01:35:11.009 --> 01:35:12.663
- Come.
- Papa.

1091
01:35:13.969 --> 01:35:15.448
'What is it. child?'

1092
01:35:15.535 --> 01:35:17.886
Emily's decided to travel
with me to Brussels.

1093
01:35:17.973 --> 01:35:20.018
Are you sure. Emily Jane?

1094
01:35:21.324 --> 01:35:24.153
- Yes. papa.
- 'Very well.'

1095
01:35:26.198 --> 01:35:27.765
'So you're all prepared?'

1096
01:35:27.852 --> 01:35:29.245
- 'Yes.'
- 'Good. good.'

1097
01:35:29.332 --> 01:35:30.942
- 'Goodnight. papa.'
- 'Goodnight. child.'

1098
01:35:31.029 --> 01:35:32.770
- 'Goodnight. Aunt Branwell.'
- 'Goodnight. Emily.'

1099
01:35:36.165 --> 01:35:37.122
Ms. Bronte.

1100
01:35:37.209 --> 01:35:38.689
'Good evening.'

1101
01:35:38.776 --> 01:35:40.865
It's very exciting news
about-about Brussels.

1102
01:35:40.952 --> 01:35:42.432
Are-are you looking forward
to it?

1103
01:35:42.519 --> 01:35:43.433
Yes. thank you. I am.

1104
01:35:46.218 --> 01:35:48.351
Perhaps. perhaps
you will find some inspiration

1105
01:35:48.438 --> 01:35:50.005
there for-for your writing.

1106
01:35:50.092 --> 01:35:51.920
Oh. I do not write anymore.

1107
01:35:52.007 --> 01:35:53.356
I'm to be a teacher.

1108
01:35:56.185 --> 01:35:57.708
Ah..

1109
01:35:57.795 --> 01:35:59.405
What?

1110
01:35:59.492 --> 01:36:00.493
Goodnight. curate.

1111
01:36:02.887 --> 01:36:04.236
But maybe if..

1112
01:36:05.585 --> 01:36:08.545
You-you must write. eh.
Ms. Bronte.

1113
01:36:10.503 --> 01:36:12.070
I'm very tired. Mr. Weightman.

1114
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:17.467
Yes. uh. apologies. Um..

1115
01:36:17.554 --> 01:36:20.296
I-I shall see you at-at the
morning tea tomorrow.

1116
01:36:20.383 --> 01:36:21.732
I have to pack in the morning.

1117
01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:24.779
Yes. of-of course.

1118
01:36:25.954 --> 01:36:26.868
Goodnight.

1119
01:36:32.482 --> 01:36:33.439
Goodnight.

1120
01:36:52.415 --> 01:36:56.158
So who decided to bring
the plums?

1121
01:36:56.245 --> 01:36:57.899
They are actually from
the garden.

1122
01:36:57.986 --> 01:37:00.771
Really? Oh!

1123
01:38:21.243 --> 01:38:23.375
Shouldn't you be heading off
now. brother?

1124
01:38:23.462 --> 01:38:25.073
It's the long walk back.

1125
01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.596
'Pa said I could stay
the night.'

1126
01:38:27.858 --> 01:38:29.164
See you two off in the morning.

1127
01:38:36.127 --> 01:38:37.955
'You're staying to see us off?'

1128
01:38:38.042 --> 01:38:40.218
- That's very kind.
- Yeah.

1129
01:38:43.961 --> 01:38:44.919
You're here.

1130
01:38:47.878 --> 01:38:49.836
I'm sorry for the things
I said that day.

1131
01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.318
My mind wasn't right.

1132
01:38:54.885 --> 01:38:55.930
It was the truth though.

1133
01:39:00.847 --> 01:39:01.805
I'm not a writer.

1134
01:39:04.155 --> 01:39:05.374
'Read your poem. by the way.'

1135
01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:09.900
It's brilliant.

1136
01:39:13.034 --> 01:39:15.079
Perhaps the most beautiful thing
I've ever read.

1137
01:39:19.214 --> 01:39:20.128
'Where's it?'

1138
01:39:21.477 --> 01:39:22.434
Here it is.

1139
01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:26.569
Keep it in my pocket
so I can read it sometimes.

1140
01:39:29.093 --> 01:39:31.443
<i>"Emily.."</i>

1141
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.446
<i>"...my dear beloved."</i>

1142
01:39:41.976 --> 01:39:45.022
<i>"My beloved.</i>
<i>You need to go to Brussels"</i>

1143
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:47.416
<i>"to delay the most</i>
<i>terrifying.."</i>

1144
01:39:47.503 --> 01:39:48.983
What is it?

1145
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.984
<i>"My Emily.."</i>

1146
01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:51.202
Nothing.

1147
01:39:51.289 --> 01:39:52.203
<i>"My love."</i>

1148
01:39:53.988 --> 01:39:54.945
<i>"Come back to me."</i>

1149
01:40:05.695 --> 01:40:07.653
There's only one true happiness
in this life.

1150
01:40:10.961 --> 01:40:13.050
To love and be loved.

1151
01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.968
I read that recently.

1152
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:22.103
Very true.

1153
01:40:30.154 --> 01:40:33.723
He didn't sleep in his bed
all night. curate.

1154
01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:35.986
Reverend Bronte is in his study
if you want to speak to him.

1155
01:40:36.073 --> 01:40:37.814
No. no. no.
I'm sure I can find him.

1156
01:40:37.901 --> 01:40:38.858
Thank you.

1157
01:40:40.512 --> 01:40:41.731
I've not seen him this morning.
curate.

1158
01:40:44.908 --> 01:40:45.865
Thank you.

1159
01:40:47.693 --> 01:40:51.175
Morning. uh. have you seen.
uh. Branwell Bronte?

1160
01:40:58.182 --> 01:40:59.270
Branwell!

1161
01:41:01.881 --> 01:41:03.448
Branwell!

1162
01:41:05.885 --> 01:41:07.148
Branwe--

1163
01:41:07.235 --> 01:41:08.236
'You ready. sister?'

1164
01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.761
Yes.

1165
01:41:17.984 --> 01:41:18.942
Have courage.

1166
01:41:21.597 --> 01:41:23.164
Where's Branwell?
Have you seen him?

1167
01:42:36.062 --> 01:42:37.934
She said no.

1168
01:42:38.021 --> 01:42:40.110
She said.
"Tell him to leave me be."

1169
01:44:24.997 --> 01:44:26.434
<i>Emily!</i>

1170
01:44:44.103 --> 01:44:45.061
What is it?

1171
01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:47.759
From papa.

1172
01:44:58.509 --> 01:45:01.686
"But it is with great sadness..

1173
01:45:01.773 --> 01:45:04.167
"...I write that our
dear curate

1174
01:45:04.254 --> 01:45:05.603
"William Weightman..

1175
01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.350
"Our dear curate
William Weightman

1176
01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:15.439
"lost his fight with this
terrible cholera

1177
01:45:15.526 --> 01:45:17.006
and passed away last night."

1178
01:45:20.531 --> 01:45:22.751
"He was stoic to the end."

1179
01:45:22.838 --> 01:45:25.971
"And asked in his last
few moments

1180
01:45:26.058 --> 01:45:28.060
'"if I would pass on to
my daughters in Brussels'

1181
01:45:28.147 --> 01:45:29.323
'his deepest regard."'

1182
01:45:33.283 --> 01:45:34.589
'Oh. dear!'

1183
01:45:37.287 --> 01:45:39.637
'It seems that our grandmother's
unwell now too.'

1184
01:45:42.161 --> 01:45:43.206
'We will have to go back.'

1185
01:46:22.419 --> 01:46:23.551
I was there at the end.

1186
01:46:30.079 --> 01:46:31.385
'You know what he said
when he died?'

1187
01:46:33.909 --> 01:46:34.910
His last words.

1188
01:46:41.786 --> 01:46:42.700
Neither do I.

1189
01:46:45.137 --> 01:46:47.096
I stepped out for a smoke.

1190
01:46:47.183 --> 01:46:48.140
Just for a minute..

1191
01:46:50.491 --> 01:46:51.666
...came back.

1192
01:46:54.277 --> 01:46:55.234
Gone.

1193
01:47:04.505 --> 01:47:07.464
Em! Did you write these?

1194
01:47:09.205 --> 01:47:11.642
These poems. they're so..

1195
01:47:11.729 --> 01:47:14.036
Emily! Emily!

1196
01:47:14.123 --> 01:47:15.864
- Someone should see these.
- No! The end!

1197
01:47:15.951 --> 01:47:17.256
You deserve for someone to see.

1198
01:47:17.343 --> 01:47:20.956
Someone did!
Someone did see them! You!

1199
01:47:27.484 --> 01:47:28.746
'He's asking for you again.'

1200
01:47:40.497 --> 01:47:42.238
More opium.

1201
01:47:42.325 --> 01:47:43.674
- It's not time yet.
- 'Give it to me!'

1202
01:47:49.245 --> 01:47:50.202
Em. come here.

1203
01:47:51.334 --> 01:47:52.291
Emily. look at you.

1204
01:47:59.298 --> 01:48:01.866
Why did you not write?

1205
01:48:10.092 --> 01:48:11.615
I love you. Em.

1206
01:48:14.096 --> 01:48:15.401
'I did it because I love you.'

1207
01:48:20.015 --> 01:48:20.929
Did what?

1208
01:48:37.728 --> 01:48:38.642
Em!

1209
01:48:54.876 --> 01:48:55.790
Branwell!

1210
01:49:02.884 --> 01:49:04.059
Couldn't get him to lie down.

1211
01:49:08.716 --> 01:49:10.369
He asked that
I should give you this.

1212
01:49:36.395 --> 01:49:39.529
<i>"Dear Emily. I'm giving this</i>
<i>letter to Branwell</i>

1214
01:49:41.313 --> 01:49:43.185

1215
01:49:43.272 --> 01:49:45.056
<i>"To delay."</i>

1216
01:49:45.143 --> 01:49:47.798
<i>"My dear beloved.</i>
<i>the last time we spoke</i>

1217
01:49:47.885 --> 01:49:50.105

1218
01:49:50.192 --> 01:49:52.890
<i>"And the most terrible</i>
<i>feeling came upon me."</i>

1219
01:49:52.977 --> 01:49:55.197
<i>"As if I was lying</i>
<i>already in the earth."</i>

1220
01:50:07.252 --> 01:50:10.952

1222
01:55:17.084 --> 01:55:19.216
I see you finished it then.

1223
01:56:10.311 --> 01:56:13.053
Next week we go to London
to meet with Emily's publisher.

1224
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.315
Quite important meeting.

1225
01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:19.537
Well..

1226
01:56:20.886 --> 01:56:23.367
Thank you all for coming..

1227
01:56:23.454 --> 01:56:26.196
...to share with us
our Emily's

1228
01:56:26.283 --> 01:56:28.285
wonderful achievement.

1229
01:56:28.372 --> 01:56:31.071
'To think that someone
from our family'

1230
01:56:31.158 --> 01:56:34.335
'someone from our humble
little parish'

1231
01:56:34.422 --> 01:56:37.773
'that their story would
be read in London tonight

1232
01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.383
'by some of the most
prominent minds'

1233
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:42.299
'well. it does give pause.'

1234
01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:47.652
To my daughter Emily

1235
01:56:47.739 --> 01:56:51.178
'of whom I have never
been more proud.'

1236
01:56:51.265 --> 01:56:52.483
'To Emily.'

1237
01:56:52.570 --> 01:56:53.484
'To Emily.'

1238
01:56:56.226 --> 01:57:00.491
'I have often struggled
to understand you..'

1239
01:57:00.578 --> 01:57:02.580
'....Emily Jane.'

1240
01:57:02.667 --> 01:57:06.541
'But now I see that there is
so much of your mother in you.'

1241
01:57:08.412 --> 01:57:10.545
It's my dearest wish that
Emily's mother

1242
01:57:10.632 --> 01:57:12.416
would have been here tonight
to see this.

1243
01:58:24.097 --> 01:58:25.054
Ah!

1244
01:59:03.136 --> 01:59:05.050
Charlotte!

1245
01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:06.095
He'll be here soon.

1246
01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:21.893
'To live and to be a fool.'

1247
01:59:23.721 --> 01:59:25.288
You said that to me once.
didn't you?

1248
01:59:32.513 --> 01:59:34.210
That's how I wrote my story.

1249
01:59:38.649 --> 01:59:39.607
I loved him. you know.

1250
01:59:42.436 --> 01:59:43.350
Who?

1251
01:59:45.961 --> 01:59:47.267
Silly old pea. Liam.

1252
01:59:55.449 --> 01:59:57.190
'Walked home with him
in the rain.'

1253
01:59:59.235 --> 02:00:00.976
The music was in my ears.

1254
02:00:03.196 --> 02:00:05.502
Oh. it was so full.

1255
02:00:10.681 --> 02:00:13.380
Will you do something for me.
my love?

1256
02:00:17.949 --> 02:00:19.342
The chest under our bed.

1257
02:00:20.604 --> 02:00:21.518
What is it?

1258
02:00:23.781 --> 02:00:24.782
'Do you promise me?'

1259
02:00:27.089 --> 02:00:28.046
Of course.

1260
02:00:37.186 --> 02:00:38.143
Hurry. papa!

1261
02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.157
'Charlotte!'

1262
02:00:54.464 --> 02:00:55.378
'Had to go!'

1263
02:02:27.427 --> 02:02:28.993
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>when we were little..</i>

1264
02:02:30.647 --> 02:02:32.867
'...how you would tell me
stories?'

1265
02:02:36.131 --> 02:02:38.394
I used to love listening
to your stories.

1266
02:02:40.875 --> 02:02:46.837
You did?

1267
02:02:53.627 --> 02:02:54.802
Where did they come from?
