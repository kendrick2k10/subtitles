For this week's video post.

7
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:31.033
we should explore exercise hacks
you can do at your desk--

8
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.233
how to get your heart rate going
even while you're on the clock.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.133
It might be time
to update the blog

10
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.800
with a few more healthy recipes
for women on the go.

11
00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:42.767
[♪♪]

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.633
And let's think about
adding a podcast segment

13
00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.367
for ways we can look
and feel more put together.

14
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.633
even when we're always
running out the door.

15
00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:51.633
[Sadie. digital concierge]
It is 8:00 a.m.

16
00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:52.600
Your order is ready.

17
00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:54.533
Morning.

18
00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.900
Your new order-ahead app
is my new best friend.

19
00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.467
Tipped you there.

20
00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.500
-Good morning!
-Morning. Chels.

21
00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.667
Are the latest numbers in?

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.700
Yes. The brand's had
another great week.

23
00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.767
Our follower count's up
on the blog. vlog. and podcast.

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.967
Oh. and we've had

25
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
over 5.000 unique downloads
just from this morning.

26
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.967
Oh. wow. I bet
it's that blog that went viral

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.600
about doing your laundry right?

28
00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:19.000
"What you can accomplish
with a bag of quarters.

29
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.033
no Wi-Fi.
and a vending machine."

30
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.800
[chuckles] Oh.

31
00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.667
Sadie. remind me to look into
self-folding laundry.

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.967
[Sadie]
I will remind you.

33
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.934
Uh. or your human assistant
could just remind you as well.

34
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.367
Okay. So.

35
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.266
we've got our staff meeting
at 9:00 a.m..

36
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.533
and then we've got
a mini-meditation at 9:45.

37
00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:36.633
Okay.

38
00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:37.867
At 10:30.
I've got content review.

39
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.500
and then I have you answering
your follower questions

40
00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:40.633
between 11:30 and 12:00.

41
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.000
which gives you just enough time
to grab a smoothie

42
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.300
right before
we put you in the cab

43
00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:45.600
for your big meeting
with Barbara.

44
00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:47.200
[exhales deeply]

45
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.967
I can't believe
it's finally happening. Chelsea.

46
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.500
Me and Barbara Davrow.
in the same room.

47
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:53.867
breathing the same air.

48
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700
-[sighing]
-I mean. she's the leading

49
00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:59.600
self-help expert
for women of our time.

50
00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.166
I want to make sure
that I bring in some new ideas.

51
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.166
just in case she asks me
what I'm working on--

52
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.233
although. I kind of hope

53
00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.900
the only thing
that we'll be talking about

54
00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.333
is her speaking tour
for the fall.

55
00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.834
And how you're gonna be
one of her stars?

56
00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:13.567
Lauren! You're a shoo-in!

57
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.266
You just got written up
by the New York Banner.

58
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.600
You're more than just a brand
about saving time now--

59
00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:20.233
you're an influencer.

60
00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:21.300
Did you know

61
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.266
three of her speakers
from last year's tour

62
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.500
landed major book deals.

63
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.700
and one even got
a talk show?

64
00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.533
[dreamily]
Ah. I can see it all now--

65
00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.567
The 27-Hour Day Cookbook.

66
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.367
The 27-Hour Day
skincare line.

67
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.200
a-a-athletic wear!

68
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.433
A... Lauren--

69
00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:37.867
...a partnership
with a cruise line.

70
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.934
I think maybe we should just see
how the meeting goes first.

71
00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.066
Right.

72
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.333
I love your enthusiasm. though.

73
00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:46.700
[Chelsea giggles]

74
00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:47.500
Your coffee!

75
00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.166
Oh!

76
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.533
Thank you!

77
00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:54.400
[♪♪]

78
00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:01.133
[contractor] We'll use birch

79
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.600
for the new guest rooms
and bathrooms.

80
00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.667
and poplar
for the pavilion underneath.

81
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.166
All locally sourced.
as stipulated.

82
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.400
Once you sign off.

83
00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.400
we'll start ordering materials.
arranging for permits.

84
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:10.800
We think we'll be done
right before spring.

85
00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:12.400
[woman] That's beautiful.

86
00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:13.767
Perfect. in fact.

87
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.967
Dad's blueprints
finally coming to life.

88
00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:17.967
All right. Mom.

89
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.066
Why don't you sign. hmm?

90
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.967
We're all signing this.

91
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.467
This expansion
and this whole place

92
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.667
belongs to all three of us.

93
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.300
We've put in the work
over 15 years.

94
00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.367
It's not just gonna be
my name on it.

95
00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:33.400
All right.

96
00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:36.000
That does it. then.
Congratulations. West family.

97
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.100
Your retreat is about
to double in size.

98
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:39.233
[Jack] All right!

99
00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm glad we're getting it done.

100
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:43.834
Yeah. I gotta
get back to the guests--

101
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:45.000
watercolor class.

102
00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.000
Oh. and I have a pile of bills
with my name on it.

103
00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.233
Which leaves me to update
our marketing material--

104
00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:50.900
but first.
I gotta fix the kitchen sink.

105
00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:52.066
Oh. and. honey.

106
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.266
can you take the cookies out
when the timer dings?

107
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.266
Although. you might want
to just--

108
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.233
...A minute or two before?

109
00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:56.500
I got you. Mom.

110
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.233
[♪♪]

111
00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:05.066
Here we go. Dad.

112
00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:07.533
Ahh. come on. Poppy.

113
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:08.900
Let's go.
We got a sink to fix.

114
00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:10.834
[♪♪]

115
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.367
[Barbara]
Self-help is an industry

116
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.133
that is constantly evolving
for women.

117
00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.734
There are more and more tools
at our disposal--

118
00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:23.233
apps on your phone.

119
00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:24.667
Zoom groups.

120
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.200
different kinds of bubble bath.

121
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:27.333
Yeah.

122
00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:31.500
But what is actually helping us
get what we want?

123
00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.400
And where we want?

124
00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:34.500
Exactly.

125
00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:37.633
How can we become
the women we are meant to be?

126
00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:38.567
You know. Lauren.

127
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.500
I am absolutely taken
with your brand.

128
00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:44.033
You are accessible.
encouraging--

129
00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.834
and you are always
creating new content.

130
00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:47.300
I'm 100% committed

131
00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:49.300
to helping women
find ways to save time.

132
00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.834
because it helps us
do more.

133
00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:55.734
Why have 24 hours
when you can have 27?

134
00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:58.367
Yes. exactly.

135
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.533
Now. I am looking
for female leaders

136
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.934
who can share
about their path

137
00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:06.633
to strength. power.

138
00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:07.800
and innovation.

139
00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:11.367
and can guide our audiences
on their own journeys

140
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.867
to being their best.

141
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.233
Well. I would love to join you
in that mission. Barbara.

142
00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.433
It will be very demanding.

143
00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:20.367
but be very rewarding. too.

144
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.266
Tell me this.

145
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.533
What have you done
with all this...

146
00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.100
time that you've saved?

147
00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.100
Oh. I put it right back
into the brand.

148
00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:30.800
I use it to keep doing more.

149
00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:32.233
Because. like you say.

150
00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:34.233
we should pursue what we love.

151
00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.533
and not let anything
slow us down.

152
00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.133
Ah. which is not to say

153
00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:40.467
that we should
never slow down.

154
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.066
When is the last time
that you took a day off

155
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.734
for self-care?

156
00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:45.300
Even an afternoon?

157
00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.033
I had a teeth cleaning
last week.

158
00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:48.100
[Barbara's words catch]

159
00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:50.734
Yeah. it was a-- it was
a really nice break.

160
00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:52.133
Although I did use it
to brush up

161
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:53.166
on some conversational French.

162
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.133
It was one of those
learn-a-language apps.

163
00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:57.300
I have a folder for them
on my phone--

164
00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:58.266
Yes.

165
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.934
Lauren. you are very passionate.

166
00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:02.133
and that's wonderful.

167
00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.367
but I also know
how easy it is to. well.

168
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.633
lose yourself in the business
and forget about

169
00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.767
work/life balance.

170
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.000
Burnout.

171
00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:12.500
We can't be at our best

172
00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:15.266
and help somebody else
become their mightiest.

173
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.200
if we aren't.

174
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.667
Well. all due respect.

175
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.000
but I believe
that I am at my best when I'm--

176
00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.266
Apologies for interrupting.

177
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.333
Your car service
will be here shortly.

178
00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:28.467
Thank you.

179
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.367
So this is where
we must say our goodbyes.

180
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.300
I am about to head off
to my summer house

181
00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:35.934
to rest. recharge.

182
00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:38.467
and. well. get some of
that work/life balance back.

183
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.266
Okay. Uh. uh...

184
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.633
I-I-I just want to assure you
that I am not burnt out.

185
00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:46.700
Not even close.

186
00:06:46.834 --> 00:06:48.433
[exhaling heavily]

187
00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:50.834
I'll tell you what.

188
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:53.166
Why don't we circle back
on this in a few weeks?

189
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.633
And maybe between now and then.

190
00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.967
you'll have had some time
to put yourself first.

191
00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:00.200
[stammers. words catching]

192
00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:01.333
-Nice to meet you.
-Y-Yeah.

193
00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:02.700
Thank you so much.

194
00:07:02.834 --> 00:07:05.100
It's an honor.

195
00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.533
[♪♪]

196
00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:11.400
She wants me to have "balance."

197
00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:13.433
I think she thinks
that all I do is work.

198
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.166
and I don't have anything
going on outside of it.

199
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.166
What? Of course you do!

200
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.500
You--

201
00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:21.066
[whispers] Actually.
you are always working.

202
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.934
I know!
[groaning]

203
00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:28.033
I think I really blew my chance
for the spot on the tour.

204
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:31.100
And now she's going away
for vacation. to recharge.

205
00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:32.300
and-and who knows

206
00:07:32.433 --> 00:07:35.567
if she's even gonna remember me
when she gets back?

207
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.400
Maybe you should recharge. too?

208
00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:40.266
[scoffs]
Right. yeah. Just walk away.

209
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.767
Wait!

210
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.867
Disconnecting from work
could be a really good idea.

211
00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:47.700
And besides.
we-we have tons of content

212
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.367
ready to launch
for next week.

213
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500
Now might be the perfect time
for you to step away.

214
00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:53.433
[dubiously] Okay.

215
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:54.767
I hear you.

216
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.200
I will carve out some time
this weekend

217
00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:59.033
and spend an hour...

218
00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.266
maybe half an hour--
reflecting.

219
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.600
[laughs] Lauren.
I think you're gonna need

220
00:08:02.734 --> 00:08:03.734
a little more time than that.

221
00:08:03.867 --> 00:08:05.000
What?

222
00:08:05.133 --> 00:08:05.967
Okay. listen.

223
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.233
Why don't I just
put together a few ideas?

224
00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:11.100
You know. some fun ways to get
a few days out of the city.

225
00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:14.633
you know. get at that balance
that Barbara's talking about.

226
00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:17.667
[gasps] Oh. Sadie--

227
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.967
remind me
to look into power-napping.

228
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.300
I don't think we've covered that
on the podcast yet. have we?

229
00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:22.066
[Sadie] I will remind you.

230
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.133
Oh. boy.

231
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.166
What?

232
00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:32.400
[Sadie] It is 7:00 p.m.
Call your mom.

233
00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:34.133
Sadie. call Mom.

234
00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:37.233
Let me guess.

235
00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:40.233
You got your hair mask in.
dishwasher's running.

236
00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:41.500
and dinner's in the oven?

237
00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:43.400
[laughs] Well...

238
00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:45.166
you're not too far off.

239
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.066
-How are you?
-Oh. I'm good.

240
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.100
I put the marigolds in today.

241
00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:50.667
Oh. honey.

242
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.400
I can't wait for you
to get to Connecticut.

243
00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:54.000
see what I got going on
in the yard.

244
00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.166
I'm becoming

245
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.467
quite the gardener
in my retirement.

246
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600
Hey!

247
00:08:58.734 --> 00:08:59.600
How's work?

248
00:08:59.734 --> 00:09:01.333
Didn't you have
that big meeting today?

249
00:09:01.467 --> 00:09:04.233
I did. It went...

250
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:06.700
great.

251
00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:08.500
I hope Barbara and I
will stay in touch.

252
00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:10.667
She's...
She's a fan of the brand.

253
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.400
Who isn't?

254
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:16.000
Now. I know it hasn't been easy.
building your company--

255
00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:18.700
all these years of hard work
and sacrifices.

256
00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.066
but I think
it's paying off. honey.

257
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.033
Well. Mom. I'm just
following your example.

258
00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.367
You always managed to do it all.

259
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.467
Oh. I don't know about that.

260
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.867
It's just really nice
to hear your voice.

261
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.800
Oh. it's nice to hear
yours. too. sweetie.

262
00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:35.467
Thanks for calling me.

263
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.734
[♪♪]

264
00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:39.734
Love you!

265
00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:41.533
Love you.

266
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.700
[alert dings]

267
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.867
[Sadie] It is midnight.
Time to post your entry.

268
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.533
Ohh. [sighs deeply]

269
00:09:52.934 --> 00:09:55.333
"Balance." Hmm?

270
00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:56.467
[alert dings]
Reminder...

271
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.700
prep lunch for tomorrow
and unload dishwasher.

272
00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:02.066
You have spin class
in five hours.

273
00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:04.667
[sucks lip]

274
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.367
Hmm. [chuckles]

275
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.066
Good timing. Chelsea.

276
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.533
"Peace Soul Spa."

277
00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:12.633
[gags]

278
00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:13.600
Yoga sounds good.

279
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.400
"Meadowlawn Retreat."

280
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.066
[deep breath]

281
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.200
Montana.

282
00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:21.400
"Book."

283
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:22.900
[exhales deeply]

284
00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:24.900
[♪♪]

285
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.166
So you'll add in
that piece

286
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.900
about consolidating
office supplies?

287
00:10:30.033 --> 00:10:31.633
I want to look into
cross promoting that

288
00:10:31.767 --> 00:10:33.333
with a major supplier. okay?

289
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.467
Oh! Can you please

290
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.033
get back to that coffee company
about the quick-drip pods?

291
00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:41.000
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Copy me on the email.

292
00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:42.500
N-- Never mind. No.

293
00:10:42.633 --> 00:10:44.700
I'm not going to have
access to email.

294
00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:45.567
Um...

295
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.900
What?

296
00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:49.367
Chelsea?

297
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.000
-Hello?
-The signal starts

298
00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:52.066
to cut out
right around here.

299
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.066
Oh... Oh. Right.

300
00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:56.900
Okay. well.

301
00:10:57.033 --> 00:10:58.633
I think I tied up everything
I needed to.

302
00:10:58.767 --> 00:11:00.867
[tapping thighs anxiously]

303
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
At least... I hope I did.

304
00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:09.800
[♪♪]

305
00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:11.066
[man] There you go.

306
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.100
Oh! Perfect!

307
00:11:12.233 --> 00:11:13.233
Great shot!

308
00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:14.166
-Thank you!
-Nice start.

309
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.200
Did you remember
to unplug the toaster?

310
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.900
Yes. And the humidifier
and the coffee pot.

311
00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:20.400
[Diane] And you're sure
your folks have the number here?

312
00:11:20.533 --> 00:11:21.266
They're not gonna
need to call us.

313
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.633
because the kids
are gonna be fine.

314
00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:24.800
As long as they don't let them
eat their weight in candy bars.

315
00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.200
[both laughing]

316
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.567
[♪♪]

317
00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:36.567
[sighs]

318
00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:40.233
[Ayla]
Welcome! And you are...?

319
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.533
-Lauren.
-Lauren!

320
00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.967
Ah. yes.

321
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.734
What brings you
to Meadowlawn. Lauren?

322
00:11:44.867 --> 00:11:46.967
Well. I just decided
I needed a break from work.

323
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.200
You know. just get back
some of that balance.

324
00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:52.300
You'll find it easy
to disconnect here.

325
00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:54.900
Putting technology aside
makes a huge difference.

326
00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:57.100
That. and not having clocks.

327
00:11:57.233 --> 00:11:59.033
I'm sorry.
You don't have clocks?

328
00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:00.800
We encourage guests
to rise when they like.

329
00:12:00.934 --> 00:12:01.800
sleep when they're tired.

330
00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:03.300
eat when they're hungry.

331
00:12:03.433 --> 00:12:05.500
Basically. get in touch
with their internal clocks.

332
00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:06.767
-Mm.
-We do use bells.

333
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.667
if there's a gathering.

334
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.667
Bells?

335
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.967
We have outdoor
and crafting activities

336
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.000
every morning.

337
00:12:12.133 --> 00:12:13.934
and free time in the afternoons.

338
00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.166
Kitchen is always open.

339
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.867
although we do eat as a group
for dinner every night.

340
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.266
Take time to share.
get to know each other.

341
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.967
Reflect.

342
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.633
Yes! Yes. I can't wait
to jump right into all of that.

343
00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:25.133
Okay. if you're ready.

344
00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:26.600
I'll go ahead
and store your gadgets.

345
00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:27.834
Great! Yes.

346
00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:29.166
Okay.

347
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.200
I only brought a few things

348
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.166
because I knew
this would be happening. so.

349
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.667
Okay. And...

350
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.000
And...

351
00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:43.200
Oh...

352
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:45.033
And... there.

353
00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.767
Okay.

354
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.333
Oh. and your...

355
00:12:49.467 --> 00:12:51.033
Oh! Yes.

356
00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:53.166
And...

357
00:12:57.834 --> 00:12:58.967
Okay.

358
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.233
Soon. you won't even
miss these.

359
00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:02.100
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

360
00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:03.834
You're gonna be
in the Pine Room.

361
00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:06.166
Upstairs. last door
at the end of the hall.

362
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.266
Kyle will put
your bags in there for you.

363
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.500
Let us know
if there is anything we can do

364
00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:10.533
to make you more comfortable.

365
00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:13.166
Thank you. Okay. Thanks.

366
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.233
Mm-hmm.

367
00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:19.333
They're safe.
Don't worry.

368
00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:20.600
I got it.

369
00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.633
-[Lauren chuckles uncomfortably]
-It's okay.

370
00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:27.000
[exhaling deeply]

371
00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:29.066
[♪♪]

372
00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:33.400
Laundry day?

373
00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.900
Ha. More like laundry week.

374
00:13:36.033 --> 00:13:38.333
now that Ayla's
on cooking duty with Mom.

375
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:40.200
What brings you by. Doc?

376
00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:41.500
I had a house call
around the corner--

377
00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:42.467
the Boones' dog swallowed

378
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.567
some of the grandkids'
sidewalk chalk.

379
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.166
-[chuckles]
-He's fine now.

380
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.900
I thought I'd drop
a few treats off for Poppy.

381
00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:51.133
What's that?

382
00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:53.367
[oinks]

383
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.533
And I found a pig.

384
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.900
Way to bury the lede. Paul!

385
00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:58.166
She's got a little infection
on her hoof.

386
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.433
but I got it cleared up.

387
00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:01.066
but she's gonna need
to be rehabbed for a bit

388
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.000
before she's fit to adopt.

389
00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:04.667
Well. you know you can
rehab her here.

390
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.000
A pig?

391
00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:07.834
When you're all about
to start construction?

392
00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:09.900
I think your mom
might kill me. Jack.

393
00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.000
[laughs]

394
00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:12.133
You know. your dad almost did--

395
00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.066
all those summers you helped out
around the office.

396
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.800
and nearly brought home a zoo.

397
00:14:15.934 --> 00:14:17.433
Mom wouldn't be able
to resist that face.

398
00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:21.000
Well. we do have a few rescues
around the house right now.

399
00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:22.800
and Tilly might be glad
for the reprieve.

400
00:14:22.934 --> 00:14:24.300
All right. well.
bring her on out.

401
00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:25.533
We'll treat her
like one of the guests.

402
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.834
Sadie. please look up
beginner knitting patterns for--

403
00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:34.233
[whimpers] Oh.

404
00:14:34.367 --> 00:14:35.266
I'm off the grid.

405
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.633
[deep breath]

406
00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:38.500
Okay. Uh...

407
00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:40.166
Reading! Yep.

408
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.333
Reading...

409
00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:45.100
is a nice normal
vacation activity.

410
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.266
Okay...

411
00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.166
"Chapter one."

412
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.033
Chapter one...

413
00:14:55.934 --> 00:14:56.934
No.

414
00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:57.900
[thumps book down]

415
00:14:58.033 --> 00:14:59.000
[grunts]

416
00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:00.734
Okay.

417
00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:04.900
[♪♪]

418
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.867
[birds singing]

419
00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:13.734
[sighs contentedly]

420
00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:16.000
[birds singing]

421
00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:20.233
On this very special episode
of The 27-Hour Day.

422
00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:22.500
I'm calculating how many laps
it will take me

423
00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:25.700
to get to my daily quota
of 10.000 steps.

424
00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:28.800
No gadgets.
no pen and paper...

425
00:15:28.934 --> 00:15:32.000
just a little mental math
and a beautiful day.

426
00:15:32.133 --> 00:15:34.433
stretching out
in front of me.

427
00:15:37.266 --> 00:15:39.467
Ooh! Ooh. ooh!
Yeah. okay. stop-stop-stop! Ooh!

428
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.467
What. here?

429
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.533
-Yeah.
-Um...

430
00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:42.834
Okay. okay. Marybeth?
Hello?

431
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:44.567
Oh-- can you hear me?

432
00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:47.000
[groans]

433
00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:48.000
Can you hear me? Hello?

434
00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:50.200
Ah! I said
I can do the Kempers' wedding.

435
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:51.400
Mother of the bride's
a real handful.

436
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.200
but she's my kind of handful.
if you know what I mean.

437
00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.166
Can you hear the birds.
Marybeth?

438
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.900
[birds chirping and singing]

439
00:15:58.033 --> 00:15:59.433
Sounds like my meditation app.

440
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.400
It's only a week. Lauren.

441
00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:05.500
Only a week.

442
00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:09.033
The fourth's time a charm.
One...

443
00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:11.033
two. three...

444
00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:13.433
Go! Go get it!
Go get it!

445
00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:14.734
Oink.

446
00:16:14.867 --> 00:16:15.900
Come on.
You need some gentle exercise.

447
00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:17.133
It's gonna be good
for your foot.

448
00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:18.233
Oink.

449
00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:19.967
All right. Take five.

450
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.633
[exhales deeply]

451
00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:24.800
Workaholic New Yorker. 12:00.

452
00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:27.033
-Hey. there.
-Hi.

453
00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:28.100
[Lauren chuckles]

454
00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:29.900
I didn't realize
there was an animal component

455
00:16:30.033 --> 00:16:31.633
to this retreat.

456
00:16:31.767 --> 00:16:34.567
Guess they're gonna help us
be one with nature.

457
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.700
or learn how to meditate.

458
00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:36.934
[chuckles]

459
00:16:37.066 --> 00:16:38.166
Uh. no.

460
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.700
There's not really an... animal.
uh. element. technically.

461
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.033
but you're more than welcome
to hang out with them--

462
00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:43.934
zero meditation required.

463
00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:45.300
Huh.

464
00:16:45.433 --> 00:16:47.066
Hi. I'm. uh. I'm Jack.
by the way.

465
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.133
I'm one of the owners here.

466
00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:49.533
If you have any questions
while you're here...

467
00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:51.433
I'm Lauren. Hi.

468
00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:52.767
-Hi.
-Nice to mee-- uh...

469
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.700
[chuckling]
Nice to meet you.

470
00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:56.900
Nice to meet you. too.

471
00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:02.166
If you're looking
for some trails.

472
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.500
there's some really nice ones
down this way.

473
00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:06.000
You just keep following
the path.

474
00:17:06.133 --> 00:17:06.967
-Oh.

475
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.000
And. uh. you know.
areas for relaxing.

476
00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:10.133
quiet contemplation.

477
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.133
Sort of working my way up
to contemplation.

478
00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.533
First vacation in a while?

479
00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:19.133
Yeah. well. first vacation
ever. actually.

480
00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:21.834
Any advice
for getting acclimated?

481
00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:24.967
Not really used
to having nothing to do.

482
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.166
Yeah. Sure.

483
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.367
Breathe.

484
00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:32.934
"Breathe"?

485
00:17:33.066 --> 00:17:34.800
That's helpful.

486
00:17:34.934 --> 00:17:36.133
You're welcome.

487
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.800
-Great.
-Breathe.

488
00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:40.333
-Gonna work on that.
-Great.

489
00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:41.700
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

490
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.800
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

491
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800
Well...

492
00:17:50.934 --> 00:17:53.600
she's gonna need
some time to adjust.

493
00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:55.033
Come on.
You ready now?

494
00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:57.467
-[pig grunts]
-Okay. there we go!

495
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.066
[Jack]
Hello. everybody. Welcome.

496
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.400
We usually go around.
introduce ourselves.

497
00:18:04.533 --> 00:18:06.767
I think you all know me
and. uh. my sister.

498
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.166
Ayla.

499
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.667
my mom. Sally.

500
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.266
Who'd like to go first?

501
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.600
I'll go.

502
00:18:12.734 --> 00:18:14.767
Uh. I'm Lauren.

503
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.834
and I have only
asked my smart watch

504
00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:19.266
to do three things today.

505
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.233
so... I'm doing great.

506
00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:25.066
Uh. I don't
really like sitting still.

507
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.433
so here's hoping
I can embrace unplugging.

508
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.734
Uh. I am Diane.

509
00:18:31.867 --> 00:18:35.500
and I am here
with my husband. Mike.

510
00:18:35.633 --> 00:18:38.100
We have three kids.
we work at the same law firm.

511
00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:40.867
and. lately. we have been
texting each other

512
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.900
more than actually speaking.

513
00:18:43.033 --> 00:18:44.867
so we're here
to try to talk more.

514
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.567
-And relax.
-[laughter]

515
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.333
Something Diane has not
always been very good at.

516
00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:52.567
uh. but I. on the other hand...

517
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.200
well. you'll see.
[chuckles]

518
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.033
Hi. everyone.
I'm Heather.

519
00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:01.767
Uh. I'm an event planner
in Charleston.

520
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.934
I've coordinated
112 weddings this year--

521
00:19:05.066 --> 00:19:06.233
a record for my company--

522
00:19:06.367 --> 00:19:07.667
but I also snoozed through

523
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.133
part of a rehearsal dinner
last week. so...

524
00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:11.633
I'm here to rest up

525
00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:12.767
and craft.

526
00:19:13.934 --> 00:19:16.133
Oh. I love to craft.

527
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.567
I'm Roger.

528
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.800
I'm recently retired.

529
00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:21.900
which I'm still
getting used to saying.

530
00:19:22.033 --> 00:19:24.400
I've been in the house
for the last three months

531
00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:27.633
and I can't for the life of me
figure out what to do next.

532
00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.767
So this is a break
from my break.

533
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.667
[laughter]

534
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.333
It's so good
to have you all here.

535
00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:35.467
and you've picked
a perfect week to come--

536
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.300
our annual "Honey Fest"
is next Saturday night.

537
00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:39.467
and everyone's
invited to attend.

538
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.667
Ooh.

539
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.233
Uh. there's a ton
of bee kitsch...

540
00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:45.734
[laughter]

541
00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:46.667
...but it really is top-notch.

542
00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:51.300
[Ayla]
These here are journals...

543
00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:52.934
for jotting down
any thoughts you're having

544
00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:53.967
about being here.

545
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.667
or being away
from your regular routines.

546
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.166
They are just for you.

547
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.166
Thanks.

548
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.667
[♪♪]

549
00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:07.667
[sighs]

550
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.600
Okay.

551
00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:15.266
Okay.

552
00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:18.834
[knocking at door]

553
00:20:22.767 --> 00:20:24.233
I hope I'm not disturbing you?

554
00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:25.567
No. not at all.

555
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.967
Since you mentioned
you do a podcast.

556
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.133
I thought maybe this would be

557
00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:30.066
a good alternative
to journaling.

558
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.000
You can record
any thoughts you have on that.

559
00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:33.166
if you like.

560
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.333
That's so nice of you. but...

561
00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:38.133
isn't this technology
against the rules?

562
00:20:38.266 --> 00:20:39.800
I think
we can make an exception.

563
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.934
[chuckles] Thanks!

564
00:20:47.266 --> 00:20:49.233
[laughs]

565
00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:51.567
Okay.

566
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.166
[click]

567
00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:56.133
Hi there.

568
00:20:56.266 --> 00:20:59.834
This is Lauren
from The 27-Hour Day.

569
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.867
and I'm coming to you
from Springfield. Montana.

570
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.734
where I am taking a vacation

571
00:21:05.867 --> 00:21:09.166
that I haven't scheduled
down to the hour.

572
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.133
or turned into

573
00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:13.066
a strategically-planned
long weekend.

574
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.500
No.

575
00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:15.734
[buzz of crickets chirping]

576
00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:18.500
I'm...

577
00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:21.400
actually
in the middle of a forest...

578
00:21:22.633 --> 00:21:26.033
...totally disconnected.

579
00:21:27.367 --> 00:21:29.767
And I'm kinda scared.

580
00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:42.900
[Jack] All right. all right.

581
00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:44.066
[rooster crowing]

582
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.834
Here we are. Okay.

583
00:21:45.967 --> 00:21:47.400
[horse whinnies]

584
00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:49.500
Yes!

585
00:21:49.633 --> 00:21:51.200
No.

586
00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:54.767
What are you looking at?

587
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.834
If it's so easy.
why don't you try?

588
00:21:56.967 --> 00:21:57.834
[Poppy whines]

589
00:21:57.967 --> 00:21:59.734
That's what I thought.
Exactly.

590
00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:00.900
[chuckles]
Good morning.

591
00:22:01.033 --> 00:22:02.500
Hey. Morning.

592
00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.033
No weights this morning?

593
00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.867
Nope.
Just taking a quite stroll.

594
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.800
as part of
my leisurely morning.

595
00:22:09.934 --> 00:22:11.767
Leisurely. huh?

596
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.867
Well. I heard
somebody else up at 5:30 a.m.

597
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.734
I'm guessing it wasn't you?

598
00:22:17.867 --> 00:22:20.400
Okay. so. I maybe
did a yoga routine

599
00:22:20.533 --> 00:22:21.700
when I first woke up.

600
00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:25.567
And then
I tried to knit a little.

601
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.000
then I wrote a few postcards
that I picked up at the airport.

602
00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:30.633
but it was all very relaxing!

603
00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:34.166
It's exactly what I wanted to do
for the last few hours.

604
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.600
Sounds like it.

605
00:22:36.967 --> 00:22:39.033
You know. if you add
a little duct tape

606
00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:40.200
to the end of that.

607
00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:42.200
it'll grab the light faster.

608
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.500
Helpful hints
are kind of my thing.

609
00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:47.333
[Jack chuckles]

610
00:22:51.166 --> 00:22:52.533
Let's see
if this is gonna work.

611
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.567
Imagine if this works.

612
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.800
[chuckles skeptically]

613
00:23:00.934 --> 00:23:02.500
[stops chuckling]

614
00:23:03.667 --> 00:23:04.567
'Kay. it works.

615
00:23:07.266 --> 00:23:10.467
I had the best sleep of my life
last night--

616
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.033
no kids. no alarm clock.

617
00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:13.266
I only woke up once.

618
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.500
thinking I'd forgotten

619
00:23:14.633 --> 00:23:16.633
to put in the silverware count
for the Semples' wedding.

620
00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:19.200
but they got married
ages ago. so.

621
00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:21.233
Is anyone else
hearing emails come in.

622
00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.300
and then forgetting that
you have no way to check them?

623
00:23:23.433 --> 00:23:24.266
Totally!

624
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.367
Is it terrible
that I miss that sound?

625
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.400
Not as terrible
as missing your bridezillas.

626
00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:29.767
I've been doing this
long enough.

627
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.533
I seem to speak
their language.

628
00:23:31.667 --> 00:23:32.767
Oh!

629
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.266
Leave it to me
to ruin my new dress.

630
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.367
-Oh. no.
-Oh. don't worry.

631
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.567
I'm an expert in stains.

632
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.066
When we get back to the house.
I have a hack for you.

633
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.533
-Hmm!
-"Have a..."

634
00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:43.567
-Lauren?
-Mm-hmm?

635
00:23:44.734 --> 00:23:46.166
Are you Lauren Garrett?

636
00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:48.100
Yes.

637
00:23:48.233 --> 00:23:49.633
[quietly] Oh. my god.

638
00:23:49.767 --> 00:23:50.800
[whispering]
It's Lauren Garrett.

639
00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:52.967
The 27-Hour Day!

640
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.567
-I love your podcast.
-Oh.

641
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.467
Your tips have
helped me so much

642
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.467
as an event planner.

643
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600
you have no idea.

644
00:23:58.734 --> 00:24:01.467
Her episodes. oh. they are
all about saving time.

645
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.400
multi-tasking.

646
00:24:02.533 --> 00:24:05.100
and making the most
of a few minutes.

647
00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:06.667
I'm a devoted listener!

648
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.533
I'm so glad
my advice has been helpful.

649
00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:10.100
I mean.
that's why I do what I do.

650
00:24:10.233 --> 00:24:13.133
Wow. Sounds like
I need to start listening.

651
00:24:13.266 --> 00:24:14.867
Do you ever run out of ideas?

652
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.133
Not yet.

653
00:24:16.266 --> 00:24:17.367
Wow. Lauren.

654
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.300
You are one prolific
berry-picker.

655
00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:22.100
Uh. is this too many?

656
00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:23.600
Oh. no. no. no.
Pick as many as you want.

657
00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:25.600
Although there aren't any awards
at the end.

658
00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:27.533
-[chuckles uncomfortably]
-Just lots of pie.

659
00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.367
Hey. guys.
there's some more over there.

660
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.200
Oh. okay. Yeah.

661
00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:32.467
Tell me more.

662
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.667
[Heather] Ask her
all the questions

663
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.700
and she has all the answers.

664
00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:36.533
[to self]
Slow down. Lauren.

665
00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:38.166
[Heather]
I want to keep exploring

666
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.133
this concept of relaxation.

667
00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:42.600
Maybe put that gorgeous tub
in my room to good use.

668
00:24:42.734 --> 00:24:43.667
-Oh!
-How about you. Lauren?

669
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.200
Any plans this afternoon?

670
00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.300
I haven't decided
what I'm gonna do. actually.

671
00:24:47.433 --> 00:24:49.333
Well. it's perfect weather
to go out on the lake.

672
00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:51.166
That is. if that's something
you want to do.

for 2:00 today.

[blueprints rustling]

675
00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.500
We are gonna need to up
our advertising in the fall.

676
00:25:03.633 --> 00:25:05.033
This place needs
to be at full capacity

677
00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:06.667
when they construction's done.

678
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.834
Even with the backing
of our investors.

679
00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:10.767
I think we're gonna need
full-time help

680
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.166
once this is done.
not just here and there.

681
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.200
If we hire more staff.

682
00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:15.200
it will require more money.

683
00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:17.367
I'm trying to stretch
every dollar of this investment.

684
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.500
Which we should be.

685
00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:20.066
But if we're overwhelmed.

686
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.066
we won't be a good example
for our guests.

687
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.934
Let's start with part-time.

688
00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:25.000
We'll make it happen.

689
00:25:25.133 --> 00:25:26.667
Let's not worry. Deal?

690
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.900
[sighing heavily]

691
00:25:28.033 --> 00:25:28.934
Deal.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.433
Are you trying to find time
to explore the great outdoors.

695
00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:49.333
and do some pleasure reading?

696
00:25:49.467 --> 00:25:52.033
Well. I have a hack for you.

697
00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:55.000
Lock away your watch.
find a canoe.

698
00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:58.367
and head out into the water.
with your new title.

699
00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.900
Today. I'm paddling

705
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.767
What?

706
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.233
No!

707
00:26:20.367 --> 00:26:23.166
How did I even do that?

708
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.266
[groans] No!

709
00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:27.667
Okay.

710
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.500
Uh...

711
00:26:29.633 --> 00:26:31.266
Oh.

712
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.900
[Jack] You got a hack
for canoeing without a paddle?

713
00:26:39.033 --> 00:26:40.967
I do not.

714
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.800
But if you'd given me
a few more minutes.

715
00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:44.800
I assure you
that I would have.

716

[sighs]

717
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.166
This is what I get for
losing myself in a good book.

You don't want to just
leave me out here.

719
00:26:50.867 --> 00:26:53.967
to teach me a lesson
about quiet contemplation?

720
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.967
You know. I thought about it...

721
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.867
but you might get sunburned.

722
00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:00.533
-Oh.
-Yeah.

723
00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:11.633
That must be
a pretty engrossing book.

724
00:27:11.767 --> 00:27:13.500
Uh... [chuckles]

725
00:27:14.834 --> 00:27:16.633
It is. it's about the habits

726
00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:19.033
of highly-successful
female entrepreneurs.

727
00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:25.233
There must be a chapter
about making time to relax?

728
00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:27.033
You know. I haven't gotten
to that yet.

729
00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:30.500
Well. you're in for a treat.

730
00:27:30.633 --> 00:27:33.133
Does it bother you
that I like to get things done?

731
00:27:33.266 --> 00:27:35.333
No. Not at all.

732
00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:37.300
I just hope you're doing things
because you like them.

733
00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:38.934
and not just to cross them
off your list.

734
00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:42.734
Don't get too caught up
in that book. all right?

735
00:27:42.867 --> 00:27:45.667
We're having something
really good for dinner.

736
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.533
[♪♪]

737
00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:56.467
[line rings]

738
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.133
[ringing]

739
00:27:58.266 --> 00:27:59.800
And in proximity to the creek.
do you think it would be okay...

740
00:27:59.934 --> 00:28:00.867
Sorry. guys.
One second.

741
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.800
...plant a vegetable garden.
around here?

742
00:28:01.934 --> 00:28:02.767
Yeah! You could have
a nice little....

743
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.133
Lowell. Hey!

744
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:05.066
So. you're gonna send me

745
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.967
those signed copies
of the agreement?

746
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.200
Listen. pal.
I'm really sorry.

747
00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:10.600
Our deal isn't exactly closed.

748
00:28:10.734 --> 00:28:12.066
What do you mean
it's not closed?

749
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.533
I thought the deal was done.

750
00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:15.266
I mean. we're starting
construction over here.

751
00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:18.300
This other property's come up
that the partners

752
00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:19.367
are interested in.

753
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.333
Any way you can come in.

754
00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:22.066
give a presentation
this Thursday?

755
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.967
Yeah. Yeah. no. Of course.

756
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.667
That's great. Jack.
I'll see you Thursday.

757
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:31.667
[thunder rumbling]

758
00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:36.633
[Ayla] So. we like to ask
a question before dinner.

759
00:28:36.767 --> 00:28:38.567
just to learn more
about each other.

760
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.700
There are no wrong answers here.

761
00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:42.467
Are you sure about that?

762
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.266
-[laughter]
-There's no judgment. I promise.

763
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.967
If you had an afternoon
to do anything.

764
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.433
what would it be?

765
00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:49.934
Drink coffee in Paris.

766
00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:51.533
Watch a bluegrass concert.

767
00:28:51.667 --> 00:28:52.767
Go on a safari.

768
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.433
Play soccer with our kids.

769
00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:57.300
-Get a pedicure.
-What?

770
00:28:57.433 --> 00:28:58.400
Okay. I changed mine.

771
00:28:58.533 --> 00:29:01.600
Mike and I have a picnic--
just the two of us.

772
00:29:01.734 --> 00:29:03.033
[Heather] Mine's easy.

773
00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:06.000
I go to a craft show.
early entry.

774
00:29:06.133 --> 00:29:07.433
I'd take an architectural tour.

775
00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:10.467
explore part of a city
I've never seen.

776
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.967
Ooh. there are so many things

777
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.533
I could do
with a free afternoon.

778
00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:18.000
I would go visit my mom...

779
00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:22.200
and we'd just sit on the porch
and talk.

780
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.500
It's been a long time
since I've done that.

781
00:29:29.433 --> 00:29:31.467
That's a nice answer.

782
00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:35.266
[♪♪]

783
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.233
[Mike comments indistinctly]

784
00:29:36.367 --> 00:29:38.934
[Diane] Not true!
Okay. maybe sometimes.

785
00:29:39.066 --> 00:29:40.133
[laughter]

786
00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:42.066
[Ayla] Oh. nice move. Mom!

787
00:29:43.433 --> 00:29:44.800
Hey there.

788
00:29:44.934 --> 00:29:46.767
Hi.

789
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.266
Board games
not your thing. either?

790
00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.300
Ah. not really.

791
00:29:51.433 --> 00:29:53.367
I take it you'd rather knit?

792
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.433
Oh. this?

793
00:29:54.567 --> 00:29:57.033
No. This is just a ruse.

794
00:29:57.166 --> 00:29:59.633
I'm about to use these needles
to break into the tech safe.

795
00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:01.600
check my email.

796
00:30:01.734 --> 00:30:04.600
read a few articles I bookmarked
about speedy blenders.

797
00:30:04.734 --> 00:30:05.533
[Jack laughs]

798
00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:07.667
Well. I'm about
to go do this thing

799
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.834
that I think
you might like. too.

800
00:30:09.967 --> 00:30:11.333
Which is?

801
00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:13.300
Come with me.

802
00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:18.700
Hammocks?

803
00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:21.300
This is your coveted activity?

804
00:30:22.633 --> 00:30:25.033
Don't knock it
till you try it.

805
00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:26.233
Take your pick.

806
00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:28.433
I pick that one.

807
00:30:28.567 --> 00:30:29.633
Okay.

808
00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:33.200
Okay. this is
actually pretty great.

809
00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:37.700
Just sink in
and look at the stars.

810
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.834
[Lauren breathes deeply.
exhales]

811
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.367
[♪♪]

812
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.033
[laughs] You thought I went
right to sleep. didn't you?

813
00:30:48.166 --> 00:30:50.200
[both chuckling]

814
00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:52.166
[Jack] You do look
8% more relaxed

815
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.200
than when you got here.

816
00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:55.500
What? Only 8%?

817
00:30:55.633 --> 00:30:58.433
There's still a few more days
to work on it.

818
00:30:58.567 --> 00:31:00.467
[Jack chuckles]

819
00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:04.934
[Jack exhales deeply]

820
00:31:11.367 --> 00:31:13.734
I should go
check on the pig.

821
00:31:13.867 --> 00:31:15.934
'Kay.

822
00:31:16.066 --> 00:31:18.300
Hey. Jack?

823
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.266
Thanks.

824
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.300
[♪♪]

825
00:31:38.533 --> 00:31:40.600
Now. I know we only have
one morning for this.

826
00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:42.133
not months and months.

827
00:31:42.266 --> 00:31:46.166
but that is also
the beauty of this activity...

828
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.233
[both chuckling]

829
00:31:47.367 --> 00:31:50.667
...to capture whatever
you see in the moment.

830
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.900
You can be

831
00:31:53.033 --> 00:31:54.000
abstract...

832
00:31:54.133 --> 00:31:55.133
Mm-hmm.

833
00:31:55.266 --> 00:31:56.633
...or more realistic.

834
00:31:58.033 --> 00:32:00.900
You can use all the colors.
or just one.

835
00:32:01.033 --> 00:32:02.834
Truly. it's whatever
speaks to you.

836
00:32:02.967 --> 00:32:04.367
-[paper rustles]
-Oh. Lauren--

837
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.400
Is everything all right?

838
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:09.500
I'm really not trying to be
an assembly line. I promise.

839
00:32:09.633 --> 00:32:12.834
I just... I can't get
the picture how I want it.

840
00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:15.500
Well. you don't have to include
every part of the scene.

841
00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:16.734
unless you want to.

842
00:32:16.867 --> 00:32:18.367
Maybe start smaller?

843
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.333
Okay.

844
00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:21.333
Do you have
any more brushes?

845
00:32:21.467 --> 00:32:23.200
Yes. Diane.

846
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.867
Okay.

847
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
I'm just going to paint
the tree.

848
00:32:31.133 --> 00:32:34.667
Just giving the tree its moment.

849
00:32:36.166 --> 00:32:38.233
So I have the yellow potentillas
along this side.

850
00:32:38.367 --> 00:32:41.033
and those rows of willows
your mom wanted for shade.

851
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:44.166
Might need to dial things back
a little bit.

852
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.500
Can we do the willows
in a second wave.

853
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:48.567
do these sections
in increments?

854
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.133
Sure. I can reorganize
the estimate.

855
00:32:50.266 --> 00:32:52.300
Is everything okay?

856
00:32:52.433 --> 00:32:53.800
Yeah. No. everything's great.

857
00:32:53.934 --> 00:32:55.066
Although. maybe
we can keep these plans

858
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.900
between you and me
for the time being?

859
00:32:57.033 --> 00:32:59.166
As long as
there's no dirt on opening day.

860
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.066
we will be golden.

861
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.734
Hmm. Absolutely.

862
00:33:02.867 --> 00:33:05.133
And I'm sure Hugh West
wouldn't have stood for that.

863
00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:06.934
[chuckles] Yeah.

864
00:33:07.066 --> 00:33:08.233
You were gonna be a doctor.
weren't you?

865
00:33:08.367 --> 00:33:10.900
A vet. actually.

866
00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:13.633
I did my first year
of grad school at Cornell.

867
00:33:13.767 --> 00:33:15.700
then Dad got sick.
I came back home.

868
00:33:15.834 --> 00:33:18.100
Mom wasn't in great shape.
Ayla was still in high school.

869
00:33:18.233 --> 00:33:19.700
It was supposed
to be temporary.

870
00:33:19.834 --> 00:33:21.533
Well. I have to hand it to you.
after all these years.

871
00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:22.734
you're all
still in business.

872
00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:25.033
And. uh.
you're still expanding--

873
00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:26.567
like your dad wanted.

874
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.467
I know he'd really be proud.

875
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.633
Yeah.

876
00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:35.900
That's the hope.

877
00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:39.734
[Lauren] Roger. that's lovely.

878
00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:40.867
[Roger] Thank you.

879
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.300
I've never painted before.
but I really enjoyed it.

880
00:33:44.433 --> 00:33:46.867
You said you recently retired.
What did you do before?

881
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.767
I was an investment banker
for 30 years.

882
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.467
up until my company
got bought out.

883
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.300
Ah. so. you didn't
exactly choose to retire?

884
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:58.100
I thought about
going somewhere else.

885
00:33:58.233 --> 00:33:59.767
but I worked so hard
for so long.

886
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.133
I figured maybe I should retire.

887
00:34:02.266 --> 00:34:04.633
Start playing golf.
traveling--

888
00:34:04.767 --> 00:34:05.867
things I always meant to do.

889
00:34:07.266 --> 00:34:09.033
But I haven't done
any of those things.

890
00:34:09.166 --> 00:34:10.433
Hmm...

891
00:34:10.567 --> 00:34:12.533
When you put so much
of yourself into your job.

892
00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:13.767
and then it's gone.

893
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.233
you feel a little lost.

894
00:34:16.266 --> 00:34:19.133
Lauren Garrett.
founder of The 27-Hour Day.

895
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:20.200
was recently seen

896
00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:23.367
throwing her knitting needles
into a closet

897
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.066
after realizing she doesn't
actually like to knit.

898
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.700
Yes. I am talking to myself.

899
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.700
Hello.

900
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.834
Squeak. squeak.

901
00:34:37.967 --> 00:34:39.700
Hey there.

902
00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:41.600
-Hi!
-Hey.

903
00:34:41.734 --> 00:34:44.166
I realized I didn't ask you
what its name is.

904
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.700
Ah. she doesn't have one yet.

905
00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:49.433
If I name the animals.
it's harder to let them go.

906
00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:52.133
And besides. some kid's
just gonna name her

907
00:34:52.266 --> 00:34:54.600
"Marshmallow"
or "Bubble Gum."

908
00:34:54.734 --> 00:34:55.834
Oh.

909
00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:58.033
She's a guest here.
just like me.

910
00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:01.333
Mm-hmm. Just here until
her little hoof gets better.

911
00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:02.834
and she's ready to adopt.

912
00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.500
You interested?

913
00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:06.000
Oh. Well...

914
00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:07.867
my super might have
a problem with it.

915
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.266
considering there are no pets
allowed in my building.

916
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.500
but I don't know.
she's pretty cute.

917
00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:13.834
[oinking]

918
00:35:13.967 --> 00:35:15.834
She is.

919
00:35:15.967 --> 00:35:17.834
Do you want to give fetch
another go with me?

920
00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:19.266
Sure. Yeah.

921
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.834
Yeah? Okay.

922
00:35:20.967 --> 00:35:22.567
[piglet snorting]

923
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.734
Go get it. Go get it!

924
00:35:26.967 --> 00:35:28.533
[oinking]

925
00:35:29.967 --> 00:35:31.533
[oinking]

926
00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:32.333
[Lauren] Try it again.

927
00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:34.834
[Jack] Hey!

928
00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.800
[piglet grunting]

929
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.967
[♪♪]

930
00:35:42.567 --> 00:35:44.033
[Jack] Yes. yes.

931
00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:45.333
I think she's getting it.

932
00:35:45.467 --> 00:35:46.734
I think she is!

933
00:35:46.867 --> 00:35:48.700
You seem like an animal person.

934
00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:50.367
-Me?
-Yeah.

935
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.166
No! [laughs]

936
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.400
No. I don't have
the right energy for animals.

937
00:35:54.533 --> 00:35:56.500
I'm not patient enough.

938
00:35:56.633 --> 00:35:58.533
You are with her.

939
00:35:58.667 --> 00:36:00.166
Well. what about you?

940
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.567
You have a heavy
animal-whisperer vibe going on.

941
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.667
Well. I like animals around.

942
00:36:07.533 --> 00:36:09.467
I think you're a nurturer.

943
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.467
You like to help others.

944
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.266
[laughs]

945
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.567
I prefer
"heavy animal-whisperer."

946
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.166
[Lauren laughs]

947
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.333
[Heather] Lauren!

948
00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:22.600
Lauren!
I found a couple hammocks!

949
00:36:22.734 --> 00:36:23.567
Do you want to check them out.

950
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.834
gossip about celebrity weddings
with me?

951
00:36:25.967 --> 00:36:27.767
[laughs] Sure.

952
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.867
Yes! Come on!

953
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.333
I'll leave you two
to some quality alone time.

954
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:34.834
[laughing]

955
00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:37.500
[♪♪]

956
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.934
[exhales deeply]

957
00:36:49.066 --> 00:36:50.500
-[footsteps]
-Hi.

958
00:36:50.633 --> 00:36:51.800
Hey.

959
00:36:51.934 --> 00:36:53.567
That hammock
is pretty good. huh?

960
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.800
It's pretty nice.

961
00:36:54.934 --> 00:36:56.300
My mom wanted to wake you up.

962
00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:58.233
but I figured
you could use the rest.

963
00:36:58.367 --> 00:36:59.333
Mm.

964
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.000
[plate thuds on counter]

965
00:37:02.133 --> 00:37:04.066
-Wh...
-There you go.

966
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.734
-[foil crinkles]
-Thank you!

967
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.200
Uh...

968
00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:10.700
do you always load
the dishwasher that way?

969
00:37:13.367 --> 00:37:14.633
Maybe.

970
00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:15.867
Why?

971
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.033
It's exactly
how I load the dishwasher

972
00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:19.667
and even a bit little "Type A."

973
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.066
[bangs door shut]

974
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.300
I just didn't
expect that from you.

975
00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:23.700
I am totally chill. okay?

976
00:37:23.834 --> 00:37:25.333
I just like things done
a certain way.

977
00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:26.500
Ah.

978
00:37:26.633 --> 00:37:28.700
So maybe we're a little more
similar than we thought.

979
00:37:28.834 --> 00:37:30.667
[chuckling]

980
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.567
Well. I looked up
your website.

981
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.233
and you're an expert
in efficiency.

982
00:37:35.367 --> 00:37:36.467
I am.

983
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.734
Since I was 12 years old.

984
00:37:38.867 --> 00:37:40.700
You've been this way
since you were 12?

985
00:37:40.834 --> 00:37:42.500
[laughs] Yeah. pretty much.

986
00:37:42.633 --> 00:37:46.667
After my dad passed away.
my mom had to go back to work.

987
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.834
then she was
going to school at night.

988
00:37:47.967 --> 00:37:50.000
so. seemed like.
all of a sudden.

989
00:37:50.133 --> 00:37:53.567
there was so much to do.
and not enough time to do it.

990
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.734
so I started looking
for little ways I could help--

991
00:37:55.867 --> 00:37:57.467
you know. setting the table
before I went bed.

992
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.967
filling the coffee pot.

993
00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:04.400
timing chores to last exactly
the length of a load of laundry.

994
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:07.033
So you really needed that nap.

995
00:38:07.166 --> 00:38:08.333
[both laughing]

996
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.567
You know what?

997
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.800
I think I'm gonna dig into
my secret ice-cream stash.

998
00:38:15.934 --> 00:38:17.300
I might even be in the mood
for sharing.

999
00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:21.233
even though you mocked
my dishwasher technique.

1000
00:38:21.367 --> 00:38:23.900
I wasn't mocking.
I was admiring.

1001
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.467
And thank you.
but I'm not the type of person

1002
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.133
who hones in on someone else's
secret ice-cream stash.

1003
00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:32.600
Huckleberry
with pie pieces.

1004
00:38:32.734 --> 00:38:35.066
It's a Montana specialty.

1005
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.100
[fork clatters]

1006
00:38:36.233 --> 00:38:38.400
Dessert for dinner?
I can get behind that.

1007
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.300
Uh...

1008
00:38:42.433 --> 00:38:43.700
you know. I actually have
a hack--

1009
00:38:43.834 --> 00:38:45.533
...Hack for this?

1010
00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:47.400
[chuckles self-consciously]

1011
00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:50.066
Oh. never mind.

1012
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.400
I mean. it's not like
we're in a hurry anyway.

1013
00:38:53.533 --> 00:38:55.100
Oh. No. we're not.

1014
00:38:58.233 --> 00:38:59.467
[exhales deeply
as fork bangs counter]

1015
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.700
Oh. my-- [mumbles]

1016
00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:02.033
...give it here.

1017
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:02.900
Yeah. take it.

1018
00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:04.667
-Okay.
-But don't really take it.

1019
00:39:05.834 --> 00:39:07.333
It's my ice cream.

1020
00:39:07.467 --> 00:39:08.800
It's gone.

1021
00:39:08.934 --> 00:39:11.033
I've taken it.
It's too late for you.

1022
00:39:15.133 --> 00:39:17.767
[♪♪]

1023
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.333
Good morning.

1024
00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:21.533
Oh! Good morning.

1025
00:39:22.633 --> 00:39:24.166
Wow.

1026
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.000
Is that going to be here?

1027
00:39:26.133 --> 00:39:28.200
Yeah. Yeah. we got
four new guest cottages.

1028
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:30.433
and a pavilion for events.

1029
00:39:30.567 --> 00:39:31.700
Jack has
a last-minute presentation

1030
00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:32.734
for our investors

1031
00:39:32.867 --> 00:39:33.934
and wanted a visual.

1032
00:39:34.066 --> 00:39:36.533
so I told him
I'd mock up a model.

1033
00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:37.700
Well. it looks fantastic.

1034
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:38.800
Thank you.

1035
00:39:38.934 --> 00:39:41.400
Kyle already had to run out
and get more glue.

1036
00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:43.266
Have you two
been together long?

1037
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.734
Ah. yeah.
just the last couple years.

1038
00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:47.233
But we've known each other
since high school.

1039
00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:48.600
Once he started working for us.

1040
00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:50.166
we just kind of
fell into things.

1041
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.233
What about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

1042
00:39:52.367 --> 00:39:55.166
Oh. my dating life
is pretty much non-existent.

1043
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.000
Turns out that asking a guy
to go grocery shopping together

1044
00:39:58.133 --> 00:40:00.533
is not a recipe for romance.

1045
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.333
Sounds like Jack.

1046
00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:05.000
who is actually
allergic to dating.

1047
00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:06.166
Really?

1048
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.400
Yeah. Yeah. he's decided
he's married to the retreat.

1049
00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:10.100
no matter how much
Mom and I push him

1050
00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:11.600
to give
a relationship a chance.

1051
00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:12.667
He's stubborn like that.

1052
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.533
Yeah. [laughs]

1053
00:40:14.667 --> 00:40:19.333
I mean. not that I know him well
or anything. it's just...

1054
00:40:19.467 --> 00:40:22.100
I could see that.

1055
00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:24.667
[♪♪]

1056
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.166
Oh. look at the...

1057
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.767
little wheelbarrow
you put over here. yeah.

1058
00:40:30.133 --> 00:40:32.600
What made you decide
to come out here. Lauren?

1059
00:40:32.734 --> 00:40:35.667
I know it must have been hard
for you to take a break.

1060
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.266
Well. actually. I had a meeting
with Barbara Davrow.

1061
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.400
Barbara Davrow?

1062
00:40:41.533 --> 00:40:43.433
The Barbara Dav...?
-Shh! Yes.

1063
00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:45.734
Oh! Tell me!

1064
00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:47.500
I was really hoping
that she would invite me

1065
00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:48.667
to join her speaking tour
this fall--

1066
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.200
[gasps]

1067
00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:52.500
...but. instead.
she thought that I needed

1068
00:40:52.633 --> 00:40:54.734
to work on my "balance."

1069
00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:56.500
and not make everything
all about work.

1070
00:40:56.633 --> 00:40:58.033
Oh...

1071
00:40:58.166 --> 00:41:00.567
Yeah. So here I am.

1072
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.967
It's so hard. isn't it?

1073
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.300
Giving our careers
anything less than 150%

1074
00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:07.967
can make us seem like
we're not invested enough.

1075
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.266
Of course.
it's easy to forget

1076
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.667
about the rest of life
waiting for us.

1077
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.333
I have two little nieces
that I adore

1078
00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:17.300
I haven't seen in...

1079
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.600
a year?

1080
00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:21.800
I know we both love
what we do.

1081
00:41:21.934 --> 00:41:23.400
but I think
a reset was in order.

1082
00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:26.233
Now can you tell me everything
about Barbara Davrow?

1083
00:41:26.367 --> 00:41:27.467
-[laughing]
-[footsteps]

1084
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.166
-Start from the beginning.
-Oh. hi. guys.

1085
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.333
[overlapping] Hi!

1086
00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:32.333
-We got some cheese!
-And crackers!

1087
00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:34.333
[♪♪]

1088
00:41:34.467 --> 00:41:35.967
[oinking]

1089
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.133
[Jack. blurts] No!
Go on. get out of here!

1090
00:41:38.266 --> 00:41:39.900
What is it?

1091
00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:43.066
I must have kept the gate
to the pen open.

1092
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.734
The pig knocked the table over.

1093
00:41:44.867 --> 00:41:46.200
and turned this
into a fun obstacle course.

1094
00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:49.266
I can't tell Ayla
this got ruined.

1095
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.800
She did it up for me so fast.

1096
00:41:50.934 --> 00:41:52.600
I have the meeting
tomorrow morning.

1097
00:41:52.734 --> 00:41:54.767
I can help you fix it.

1098
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.300
[laughs] No. Lauren.

1099
00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:57.266
Seriously.

1100
00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.900
I can put things together
in half the time

1101
00:41:59.033 --> 00:42:00.900
it should normally take.

1102
00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:03.867
It's literally
my area of expertise.

1103
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.333
You're a guest here.

1104
00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:08.166
You're supposed
to be reflecting.

1105
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.000
not doing damage control.

1106
00:42:10.133 --> 00:42:13.133
If I do any more reflecting.
I'm gonna turn into a mirror.

1107
00:42:13.266 --> 00:42:14.533
[chuckles]

1108
00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:16.367
Put my "Type A" tendencies
to work.

1109
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.367
[Jack sighs]

1110
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.033
Okay.

1111
00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:21.066
I gratefully accept.

1112
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.033
Where do we start?

1113
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.400
Breathe.

1114
00:42:28.533 --> 00:42:31.433
[♪♪]

1115
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.900
[♪♪]

1116
00:43:05.033 --> 00:43:06.467
Almost perfect.

1117
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.600
The roof on that one
is still a little crooked.

1118
00:43:08.734 --> 00:43:10.467
so just don't let anyone
get too close.

1119
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.433
You hear that?

1120
00:43:11.567 --> 00:43:12.700
[snorting]

1121
00:43:12.834 --> 00:43:13.800
Stay outta here.

1122
00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:16.233
-[piglet snorts]
-[Lauren chuckles]

1123
00:43:16.367 --> 00:43:18.767
So. your meeting's
tomorrow morning?

1124
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.100
Yeah. Yeah. it's just a...

1125
00:43:21.233 --> 00:43:23.567
kind of formality
with the Helena investors.

1126
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.967
Well. good luck.

1127
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.166
Thank you.

1128
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.967
Hey. do you. uh.

1129
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.934
do want to grab a--
a drink with me.

1130
00:43:32.066 --> 00:43:33.600
just as a "thank you"?

1131
00:43:35.066 --> 00:43:37.300
I think I could fit that in.

1132
00:43:38.734 --> 00:43:39.967
[clink]

1133
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.900
It's from a batch

1134
00:43:41.033 --> 00:43:42.767
that Ayla and Kyle made
last summer.

1135
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.800
How very artisanal.

1136
00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:46.834
Mm-hmm.

1137
00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:54.700
There's probably a reason
why it was stored in the barn.

1138
00:43:54.834 --> 00:43:55.867
[laughs loudly]

1139
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.934
So sorry!

1140
00:43:57.066 --> 00:43:59.066
I didn't want to say anything.

1141
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.834
No. I'm sorry. Ugh!

1142
00:44:00.967 --> 00:44:01.967
I'm sorry.

1143
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.934
-It's terrible.
-Terrible.

1144
00:44:04.066 --> 00:44:05.000
[laughing]

1145
00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:07.600
Did you grow up here?
On the property. I mean?

1146
00:44:07.734 --> 00:44:09.033
Yeah. since Ayla was born.

1147
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:11.266
The four of us.
we would go hiking. camping.

1148
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.000
swimming in the lake.

1149
00:44:14.133 --> 00:44:17.033
My dad. he worked
a pretty stressful sales job.

1150
00:44:17.166 --> 00:44:19.200
He retired early
after a health scare.

1151
00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:20.533
He convinced my mom

1152
00:44:20.667 --> 00:44:22.500
to turn this place
into a retreat.

1153
00:44:22.633 --> 00:44:26.000
where people could come unwind.
slow down...

1154
00:44:26.133 --> 00:44:28.400
take advantage
of how beautiful it is.

1155
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.633
It's just a shame

1156
00:44:30.767 --> 00:44:31.967
that he only got
to experience it

1157
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.333
for about a year
before he passed.

1158
00:44:35.633 --> 00:44:37.400
He had big plans
for this place.

1159
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.934
So...

1160
00:44:41.066 --> 00:44:43.100
now his mission falls to you?

1161
00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:44.367
Yeah.

1162
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.734
I've definitely been
carrying on Dad's dream.

1163
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.800
Sometimes.
I can't remember what...

1164
00:44:53.934 --> 00:44:55.667
what's his vision.
and what's mine.

1165
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.633
Well. your dad
was definitely onto something.

1166
00:44:59.767 --> 00:45:03.533
I mean. I know I've gotten
a lot from my days here.

1167
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.934
Oh. yeah?

1168
00:45:07.066 --> 00:45:07.934
[deep breath]

1169
00:45:08.066 --> 00:45:10.934
Like. uh. helping me
salvage a 3-D model?

1170
00:45:11.066 --> 00:45:12.934
[laughs] Yes.

1171
00:45:13.066 --> 00:45:16.533
I'm getting to know myself
again and...

1172
00:45:16.667 --> 00:45:18.400
[sighs deeply]

1173
00:45:18.533 --> 00:45:21.300
...for that. I could not
be more grateful.

1174
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.367
A toast... to your dad.

1175
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.834
And to the future
of the retreat--

1176
00:45:29.967 --> 00:45:32.700
may you dazzle
your investors tomorrow.

1177
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.700
To Dad...

1178
00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:38.433
and all the people that
came through because of him...

1179
00:45:38.567 --> 00:45:40.934
may none of them
drink this wine.

1180
00:45:41.066 --> 00:45:43.300
[both laughing
as glasses clink]

1181
00:45:45.467 --> 00:45:46.700
Cheers to that.

1182
00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:48.934
[Jack] Cheers to that!

1183
00:45:51.867 --> 00:45:54.500
Can't remember
if it's Tuesday or Wednesday.

1184
00:45:54.633 --> 00:45:55.600
and... [chuckles]

1185
00:45:55.734 --> 00:45:57.800
I don't really mind.

1186
00:45:59.033 --> 00:46:01.800
I'm developing
real friendships here.

1187
00:46:01.934 --> 00:46:04.033
including one with Jack.

1188
00:46:05.934 --> 00:46:08.166
All these feelings
are coming up.

1189
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.934
I haven't felt them
in a long time.

1190
00:46:12.467 --> 00:46:14.667
This... quiet.

1191
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.233
stillness...

1192
00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:20.700
it's making me more open.
more perceptive.

1193
00:46:22.066 --> 00:46:24.133
More alive.

1194
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.100
And I think I want
the rest of my life

1195
00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:31.367
to feel like this.

1196
00:46:35.967 --> 00:46:37.333
[Lauren. laughing] Hi!

1197
00:46:37.467 --> 00:46:39.333
You're doing so good!

1198
00:46:39.467 --> 00:46:41.734
Oh! Now-- Now are we racing?

1199
00:46:41.867 --> 00:46:43.000
Okay. let's go.

1200
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:44.033
[Tilly] Afternoon!

1201
00:46:44.166 --> 00:46:45.633
Hi!

1202
00:46:45.767 --> 00:46:46.700
[door bangs]

1203
00:46:46.834 --> 00:46:49.233
Looks like she's ready
for her big photo shoot.

1204
00:46:49.367 --> 00:46:51.567
She sure is!

1205
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.066
I'm Tilly.

1206
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.800
My husband and I own
the veterinary practice in town.

1207
00:46:55.934 --> 00:46:56.800
Hi! I'm Lauren.

1208
00:46:56.934 --> 00:46:58.400
I'm a guest here for the week.

1209
00:46:58.533 --> 00:47:00.100
How are you
enjoying Meadowlawn?

1210
00:47:00.233 --> 00:47:01.233
I love it.

1211
00:47:01.367 --> 00:47:03.467
It's so special here.

1212
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.567
and. plus. it's been amazing
getting to know the Wests.

1213
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.600
They're dear friends of ours.

1214
00:47:06.734 --> 00:47:08.567
We've known the kids
since they were tiny.

1215
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.100
You know. Jack used to follow
my husband around at the office

1216
00:47:11.233 --> 00:47:12.567
before he could tie his shoes.

1217
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.934
[Tilly laughs]

1218
00:47:14.066 --> 00:47:14.934
You know. for a while.

1219
00:47:15.066 --> 00:47:18.900
we thought he might even
join the practice.

1220
00:47:19.033 --> 00:47:20.934
Really? How do you mean?

1221
00:47:21.066 --> 00:47:22.967
His folks wanted him
to finish vet school.

1222
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.900
but Jack came home
when Hugh got sick.

1223
00:47:25.033 --> 00:47:27.500
and he jumped into the business
without hesitation.

1224
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.600
Oh.

1225
00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:32.633
I guess that's how
life goes sometimes.

1226
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:33.767
Right.

1227
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.533
Oh! I came to get
pictures of her

1228
00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:38.033
for her adoption flyer!

1229
00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:39.967
Of course.
There you go.

1230
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.233
That's a very sporting
little sash!

1231
00:47:42.367 --> 00:47:43.633
Come with Tilly.

1232
00:47:45.767 --> 00:47:48.133
[♪♪]

1233
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.000
[elevator bell dings]

1234
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.600
Jack. Hey.

1235
00:47:58.066 --> 00:47:59.233
You're gonna nail this. buddy.

1236
00:47:59.367 --> 00:48:00.834
That's the plan.

1237
00:48:00.967 --> 00:48:03.600
Everyone remember Jack West?
From Meadowlawn?

1238
00:48:03.734 --> 00:48:05.633
Thank you.

1239
00:48:07.834 --> 00:48:08.834
Hi. everybody.

1240
00:48:10.567 --> 00:48:12.934
If you could open your packets--
let's get started.

1241
00:48:13.066 --> 00:48:15.967
[♪♪]

1242
00:48:17.066 --> 00:48:17.967
[Lauren] Mm! Mm.

1243
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.700
Be still my heart.

1244
00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:22.633
Mm! You know. I never stopped
for samples before.

1245
00:48:22.767 --> 00:48:24.433
-Hmm?
-It's kind of a game-changer.

1246
00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:26.166
Oh. Hold the phone.

1247
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.367
Is that quilting fabric
over there?

1248
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.467
[gasps]

1249
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.266
If you're not back in 10.
I'm coming after you.

1250
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.166
Hey. Jack! How are you. buddy?

1251
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.867
-Good. How are you?
-Good. good. good.

1252
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.367
Lauren!

1253
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.834
Hey.

1254
00:48:37.967 --> 00:48:40.100
Hey! You look nice.

1255
00:48:40.233 --> 00:48:41.333
Thank you.

1256
00:48:41.467 --> 00:48:42.533
How was your meeting?

1257
00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:43.700
It was great.

1258
00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:44.800
Ended up ending early.

1259
00:48:44.934 --> 00:48:46.600
so I thought I'd join you guys
in the kitchen.

1260
00:48:46.734 --> 00:48:49.367
Really?

1261
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.934
What? I'm actually
a pretty good cook.

1262
00:48:52.066 --> 00:48:53.033
No. I believe you.

1263
00:48:53.166 --> 00:48:54.667
I'm just gonna have to try
to keep up with you.

1264
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.700
I'll try not
to leave you behind.

1265
00:48:58.266 --> 00:49:00.100
[Diane] That's perfect.

1266
00:49:00.233 --> 00:49:01.433
You are.

1267
00:49:01.567 --> 00:49:03.433
Those brownies
are gonna be amazing.

1268
00:49:03.567 --> 00:49:05.533
Thank you.

1269
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.100
[♪♪]

1270
00:49:11.367 --> 00:49:12.934
How's it going over there?

1271
00:49:14.667 --> 00:49:15.900
It's going well.

1272
00:49:16.033 --> 00:49:17.000
Good.

1273
00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:19.266
Didn't realize
this was a race.

1274
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.000
Oh. it's not.

1275
00:49:21.133 --> 00:49:22.433
Uh. I'm just choosing

1276
00:49:22.567 --> 00:49:25.700
not to spend quality time
with every single tomato.

1277
00:49:25.834 --> 00:49:27.233
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

1278
00:49:27.367 --> 00:49:28.867
I'm just gonna help you out.
just a little bit.

1279
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.934
so we can finish
before ski season.

1280
00:49:31.066 --> 00:49:33.233
[♪♪]

1281
00:49:33.367 --> 00:49:34.834
You're welcome to copy
my technique.

1282
00:49:34.967 --> 00:49:36.367
if you want.

1283
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.166
It's okay.

1284
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.567
I prefer measured
and precise.

1285
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.066
-Thank you very much.
-Oh. that's so weird.

1286
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.467
I prefer
a normal human speed. so...

1287
00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:49.834
All right. everybody.

1288
00:49:49.967 --> 00:49:51.233
Break time.

1289
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.500
You mean "leave the kitchen"?

1290
00:49:53.633 --> 00:49:54.934
A watched pot never boils.

1291
00:49:55.066 --> 00:49:56.467
Besides. we need some fresh air.

1292
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.934
You're thinking
about cleaning up.

1293
00:49:59.066 --> 00:50:00.200
No.

1294
00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:01.467
And how much time
you could save?

1295
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.600
Well. I just-- I just have
a few suggestions. that's all.

1296
00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.266
Walk away.
Let's go have some fun.

1297
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.700
Oh. Yeah. Okay. Okay!

1298
00:50:09.166 --> 00:50:10.367
Okay. everybody!

1299
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.066
Pretty easy game.

1300
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.033

Don't be intimidated
by my skill level.

1304
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.200
This is gonna be
a fierce game.

1305

Oh. you.
You-- go. go. go. go. go.

1306

Oh. Okay.

00:50:27.033 --> 00:50:28.700
Uh... you're a tough act
to follow. Jack.

1308
00:50:28.834 --> 00:50:30.500
but I'll give it a shot.

1309
00:50:30.633 --> 00:50:31.567

1310
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.266

Oh!

1322
00:50:56.867 --> 00:50:59.100
Looks like I have
some stiff competition.

1324
00:51:00.367 --> 00:51:02.000

-All right.
-Okay.

Now. remember what I did...

1327
00:51:06.367 --> 00:51:07.300
and don't do that.

You guys?

1346
00:51:41.934 --> 00:51:43.166
I'm sure we can
whip up a replacement

1347
00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.967

we already have here.

1348

Yeah?

1351
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.100
Let's get started.

1352
00:51:50.233 --> 00:51:51.200
Yay!

1353
00:51:53.266 --> 00:51:55.767
So. all we needed
was the peanut butter.

1354
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.734
a little sugar. milk. butter.

1355
00:51:57.867 --> 00:52:00.066
a bit of cornstarch...

1356
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.300

Mm!

1359
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.100
And voila. we have
chocolate-peanut butter pudding.

1360
00:52:09.467 --> 00:52:12.233
Oh! No.
It has to chill first and--

Oh. my goodness.

1362
00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:16.133

It has to sit in the fridge
for one hour.

officially closed.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.800
See if you have the cash
lying around anywhere else.

1605
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.033
I know. wow.
Look at this place!

1606
01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:36.066
We have to get some "beeware"
for the kids. honey.

1607
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.400
Only if you and I
get some. too.

1608
01:01:37.533 --> 01:01:38.600
Done!

1609
01:01:38.734 --> 01:01:40.166
Let's do it.

1610
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.433
Uh-oh.
I know those are calling to you.

1611
01:01:42.567 --> 01:01:43.667
Oh...

1612
01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.266
I only have so much room
in my suitcase.

1613
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.834
but maybe they can ship.

1614

Happy Honey Fest. everyone!

[cheering]

1618
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.934
It's a Springfield tradition
close to my family's heart.

1619
01:02:04.066 --> 01:02:05.300
and as some of you might know.

1620
01:02:05.433 --> 01:02:08.834
my dad. Hugh. helped organize
this event almost 30 years ago.

1621
01:02:08.967 --> 01:02:11.834
It's amazing to see how much
it's grown every year since.

1622
01:02:11.967 --> 01:02:13.100
Uh. before I forget.

and buy some
of her beeswax candles

1626
01:02:18.567 --> 01:02:19.667
before she sells out!

[crowd applauds]

1628
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.133
Now for the real reason
why I'm up here.

1629
01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.667
This little pig here
is up for adoption.

[crowd gushes]

1631
01:02:28.767 --> 01:02:29.934
Aww!

1632
01:02:30.066 --> 01:02:31.767
She loves
people. eating. napping.

1633
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.767
even playing fetch.

1634
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.433
She's... curious.

1635
01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:37.400
so she's gonna need
a little bit of supervision.

1636
01:02:37.533 --> 01:02:38.900
but she's really sweet.

1637
01:02:39.033 --> 01:02:41.467
If anybody wants to adopt her.
come talk to me.

1638
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.834
because we're trying to find her
a good home.

1639
01:02:44.934 --> 01:02:45.934
And now.

1640
01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.166
I'm gonna give up the mic
to my sister. Ayla West--

You having a good time?

1645
01:02:58.367 --> 01:03:01.367
Well. I have bought gifts
for everyone in my office.

1646
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.867
Uh. I have eaten my weight
in fudge.

1647
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.233
I prevented Heather

1648
01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:09.867
from buying a suitcase
full of bee-themed votives.

1649
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.033
So. yes. I'm having
a great time.

1650
01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:13.967
Well. it's your last day.

1651
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.500
You have to eat all the fudge.
right?

1652
01:03:15.633 --> 01:03:16.834
-Right.
-Yeah.

1654
01:03:17.967 --> 01:03:19.033
Yes?

1655
01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:20.633
Can we talk to you
about the pig?

1656
01:03:20.767 --> 01:03:22.567
I know someone
who's very interested.

1657

-Okay.

1659
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.500

Hey!

1663
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.867
Everything settled
with the pig?

1664
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.934
Yes. They're gonna
pick her up tomorrow.

1665
01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:07.900
Mm. Do they have
a name picked out yet?

1666
01:04:08.033 --> 01:04:10.934
I have a strong feeling
it's gonna be "Honey."

1667
01:04:11.066 --> 01:04:12.300
Of course.

1668
01:04:12.433 --> 01:04:14.633
You want to dance?

1669
01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:17.266
Uh... I tend to prefer
more structured dancing--

1670
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.900
you know.
like "The Electric Slide."

1671
01:04:19.033 --> 01:04:20.533
Just meet me in the middle.

1679
01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.600
I want to ask you a question.

1680
01:04:59.734 --> 01:05:00.767
Yeah.

Yes. so. my summer house
is 20 miles north from here.

1689
01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:28.934
I come down to Honey Fest
every summer.

1690
01:05:29.066 --> 01:05:33.967
I think it's quite interesting
how paths cross so unexpectedly.

1691
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.633
Seeing you here now.

1692
01:05:35.767 --> 01:05:38.467
it's like a decade has passed
since our meeting in New York.

1693
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600
You had a good week?

1694
01:05:39.734 --> 01:05:40.800
[deep breath. sigh]

1695
01:05:40.934 --> 01:05:42.033
It's been invaluable.

1696
01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:44.166
I have had a chance to breathe.

1697
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.266
[laughs]

1698
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.200
I finally understand
what you meant by balance.

1699
01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:50.033
Mm-hmm.

1700
01:05:50.166 --> 01:05:52.000
I've gotten
to know myself again.

1701
01:05:52.133 --> 01:05:53.867
And that person is...?

1702
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.166
Someone who always
wants to help.

1703
01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.033
even if my intentions

1704
01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:01.166
come across
as a little pushy sometimes.

1705
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.333
[laughs]

1706
01:06:02.467 --> 01:06:03.700
It turns out

1707
01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:06.333
I am really not
into knitting.

1708
01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:08.133
Oh! [laughs]

1709
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.867
Imagine if you had
had two weeks.

1710
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.433
how much more
you would know yourself.

1711
01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:14.500
Mm.

1712
01:06:14.633 --> 01:06:15.934
I have to say.

1713
01:06:16.066 --> 01:06:17.400
I am really glad

1714
01:06:17.533 --> 01:06:19.500
that it was
a meaningful experience for you.

1715
01:06:19.633 --> 01:06:23.266
And I'm also very surprised
that you took my words--

1716
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.767
to find "you time"--
so seriously.

1717
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.600
Very impressive.

1718
01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.934
Honestly. I can't wait
to get back home

1719
01:06:30.066 --> 01:06:33.433
and see what this "new life"
looks like.

1720
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.967
Tell you what.

1721
01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.667
Why don't you give me a call
when you're settled in New York?

1722
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.667
We can talk about the tour.

1723
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.900
That's my direct line.

1724
01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:47.500
Uh. yes. Of course.
I would love that.

1725
01:06:47.633 --> 01:06:48.667
All right.

1726
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.700
You enjoy the festival.

1727
01:06:53.567 --> 01:06:55.467
You too.

1728
01:06:56.834 --> 01:06:58.867
[♪♪]

1729
01:07:08.867 --> 01:07:09.767
I didn't know

1730
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.100
you knew the great
Barbara Davrow as well.

1731
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.033
I can't believe you know
Barbara Davrow personally.

1732
01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.800
Yeah. she's kind of like
our mega-famous neighbor

1733
01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:20.500
that shows up every summer
to buy honey.

1734
01:07:20.633 --> 01:07:22.000
No big deal.

1735
01:07:23.467 --> 01:07:25.500
I think she's gonna ask me

1736
01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:27.967
to join her speaking tour
this fall.

1737
01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.333
Really?

1738
01:07:29.467 --> 01:07:30.867
It would be a huge step
for my brand--

1739
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.800
just a launching pad
for my career.

1740
01:07:33.934 --> 01:07:35.333
That's amazing.

1741
01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:39.166
It would also mean
going back to work at 300%--

1742
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.133
delaying all of these changes
I want to make in my life.

1743
01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:45.400
and missing
my mom's 70th birthday.

1744
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.734
But it's what I've been
working towards for...

1745
01:07:49.867 --> 01:07:51.467
forever.

1746
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.967
Seems like you have
a tough decision to make.

1747
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.400
I will...

1748
01:07:55.533 --> 01:07:56.900
if she actually asks.

1749
01:07:57.033 --> 01:07:58.734
because now
there's the Lauren I was.

1750
01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:02.166
and there's
the Lauren I want to be.

1751
01:08:03.767 --> 01:08:05.700
I should never have
showed you that hammock.

1752
01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:07.133
[both laughing]

1753
01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:10.033
Hey. Jack.

1754
01:08:10.166 --> 01:08:12.433
Have you ever thought
about going back to vet school?

1755
01:08:12.567 --> 01:08:14.033
What?

1756
01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:15.233
[laughs] No.

1757
01:08:15.367 --> 01:08:17.233
Tilly mentioned it--

1758
01:08:17.367 --> 01:08:19.033
how you went
and then came back.

1759
01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:20.367
You stayed to help.

1760
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.133
I mean...

1761
01:08:22.266 --> 01:08:24.033
makes a lot of sense.

1762
01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:27.767
That was a decision I chose
to leave behind a long time ago.

1763
01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.900
I understand the pressure
to help. the sense of duty.

1764
01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:36.667
I don't know
if you do. Lauren.

1765
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.433
Of course I do!

1766
01:08:39.567 --> 01:08:41.967
I as the kid who made it
my mission in life

1767
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.900
to help my mom.

1768
01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:46.367
I know you were that kid. too.

1769
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.734
All I'm saying is just look
at your mom and Ayla now.

1770
01:08:49.867 --> 01:08:52.467
They're strong.
they're capable.

1771
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.533
Okay. What if I did
want to be a vet?

1772
01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:58.934
I'm closer to 40 than I am 20.

1773
01:08:59.066 --> 01:09:01.000
I'd have to start
completely over.

1774
01:09:02.967 --> 01:09:05.200
Maybe that's
not such a bad thing.

1775
01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:07.367
We're about to double
the size of the retreat.

1776
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.000
We're barely gonna be able
to juggle it all.

1777
01:09:09.133 --> 01:09:11.200
and. what. I'm just
supposed to walk away?

1778
01:09:12.433 --> 01:09:14.500
I have to be accountable here.

1779
01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:19.066
Can't just write a blog post
about it.

Lauren.

01:09:27.834 --> 01:09:31.233
Look. I know I've been
measuring my life by checklists.

1783
01:09:32.233 --> 01:09:35.233
I just don't want to see yours
pass you by.

Can't believe it's over.

01:10:03.934 --> 01:10:06.333
I can't believe it either.

1792
01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:07.367
Oh... yikes.

1793
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.800
I forgot all about this.

You have 1.457 messages.

I didn't hear that.

Oh...

1799
01:10:23.266 --> 01:10:26.000
Uh. well. yeah.
it was really nice to meet you.

1800
01:10:26.133 --> 01:10:28.834
Yeah.

1801
01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:30.300
Don't be a stranger. okay?

1802
01:10:30.433 --> 01:10:32.333
I want updates
outside of the podcast.

1803
01:10:32.467 --> 01:10:33.433
-Yes.
-Yes? Okay.

1804

You were right.

1818
01:10:58.433 --> 01:11:00.367
Easier that she doesn't
have a name.

1819
01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:05.734
I'm sorry.

1820
01:11:05.867 --> 01:11:07.900
I-I put you
on the spot last night.

1821
01:11:08.033 --> 01:11:10.066
I appreciate what you said.

1822
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.233
If I'm being honest.
a piece of me wonders--

1823
01:11:14.967 --> 01:11:16.333
"What if?"

1824
01:11:16.467 --> 01:11:17.500
But this place.

1825
01:11:17.633 --> 01:11:19.100

1826
01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.400

Bye-bye.

I know it's hard for you
when the rescues leave. honey.

1841
01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:28.300
You know what?

1842
01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:29.767
That piggy's gonna be just fine.

1843
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.300
I know about
the investment deal. Jack.

1844
01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:41.967
The VP from Helena
called me personally

1845
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.333
to apologize about
the agreement falling through.

1846
01:12:49.367 --> 01:12:50.600
Why didn't you tell me?

1847
01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.133
Because I didn't want
to worry you.

1848
01:12:55.266 --> 01:12:56.767
I want to take care
of this place

1849

Take care of me and Ayla?

What is it that you want--

1852
01:13:04.867 --> 01:13:06.000

Hi. Barbara.

It's Lauren Garrett.

1858
01:13:21.633 --> 01:13:24.233
I've been thinking a lot

1859
01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.633
about our conversation
last night.

1860
01:13:25.767 --> 01:13:27.333
and...

1861
01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:30.066
I feel like I need to be
completely honest with you.

1862

1863
01:13:37.433 --> 01:13:38.166
Lauren!

01:13:39.633 --> 01:13:40.667
Welcome back!

1865
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.166
How was your trip?
I want to hear everything. Ooh!

1866
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.633
Somebody went
antique shopping.

1867
01:13:45.767 --> 01:13:47.800
This was a gift. actually.

1868
01:13:47.934 --> 01:13:50.900
I made a recording
almost every night I was away.

1869
01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:53.700
and I thought that.
by listening to some of them.

1870
01:13:53.834 --> 01:13:55.967
it might help me plan out
my goals for the week...

1871
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.500
and moving forward.

1872
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.533
Barbara Davrow

1873
01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:02.200
offered me
a spot on her speaking tour.

[words catch]

1875
01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.433
I turned it down.

1876
01:14:04.567 --> 01:14:06.600
Wait! What?

1877
01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:08.133
[incredulously]
I turned it down.

1878
01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:12.300
I'd thought long and hard
about what I would say

1879
01:14:12.433 --> 01:14:13.734
if she offered it to me.

1880
01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:15.200
so. when we talked last night.

1881
01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:17.266
I had to tell her
that I couldn't sign on

1882
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.767
because it would mean

1883
01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:22.333
making sacrifices
that I'm not willing to make.

1884
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.800
So you mean we're not
gonna have a makeup line?

1885
01:14:27.934 --> 01:14:30.934
This past week changed how
I want to present the brand.

1886
01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:35.066
Honestly. it changed
how I want to live my life.

1887
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.734
Oh. please don't tell me
we're moving to Montana

1888
01:14:36.867 --> 01:14:38.266
to start a yoga studio.

1889
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.233
I just got an apartment
with a dishwasher.

1890
01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:42.934
We are not moving to Montana.

1891
01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:46.200
And we're not
starting a yoga studio.

1892
01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.100
But...

1893
01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:50.266
we are gonna make
some big changes.

1894
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.700
Even if it means starting over.

1895
01:14:53.834 --> 01:14:56.900
and even if our followers
don't like it.

1896
01:14:57.033 --> 01:14:59.066
Even if we lose
some of them?

1897
01:15:00.934 --> 01:15:03.533
Or... all of them?

1898
01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:05.467
Yes.

1899
01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.033
I am willing
to take that risk.

1900
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.934
You know what?

1901
01:15:13.066 --> 01:15:14.200
Whatever happens...

1902
01:15:16.567 --> 01:15:17.867
...you're not
gonna lose me.

1903
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.133
Mm!

unannounced on a weekday?

Oh. it's so good to see you.

1915
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.333
Hope it's okay that I just
showed up without calling?

It sure is.

I love it because they're fast.

01:16:08.533 --> 01:16:09.400

Hey. Mom?

01:16:14.633 --> 01:16:18.100
I wanted to come here today
to say thank you...

1928
01:16:18.233 --> 01:16:21.433
for working so hard
and doing so much

1929
01:16:21.567 --> 01:16:23.400

Oh. honey.

1931
01:16:25.734 --> 01:16:27.500
You don't have to thank me
for that.

1932
01:16:27.633 --> 01:16:29.200
I do.

1933

You were like a superhero.

You...

1935
01:16:33.967 --> 01:16:37.500
You juggled so many demands
and you never complained.

1936
01:16:37.633 --> 01:16:40.266
I think I pushed myself so hard
all of these years

1937
01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.967
because I thought
that if I slowed down.

1938
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.767
or I didn't do enough.

1939
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:49.867
that I wouldn't live up
to your example.

1940
01:16:51.467 --> 01:16:53.633
Oh... honey.

1941
01:16:55.033 --> 01:16:57.333
You could never disappoint me.

01:16:57.467 --> 01:16:59.100
Never.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.867
Well... not exactly.

1957
01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:51.500
You see.
I've spent more than 20 years

1958
01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:54.166
becoming an expert
in efficiency.

1959
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.834
I wanted to have
a time-saving tip

1960
01:17:56.967 --> 01:18:02.100
for every chore. every recipe.
every exercise...

1961
01:18:02.233 --> 01:18:04.166
but now I see
that we shouldn't always be

1962
01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.934
trying to do things faster.

1963
01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:08.934
just to do twice as much.

1964
01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.467
So. with that in mind.

1965
01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.400
I am rebranding
The 27-Hour Day.

1966
01:18:16.533 --> 01:18:20.000
I'm gonna teach myself.
and hopefully you. too.

1967
01:18:20.133 --> 01:18:23.266
how to save time
not just for what's efficient.

1968
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.300
but for what's really important.

1969
01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.100
So. I'll still help you
find the makeup products

1970
01:18:30.233 --> 01:18:32.333
that will speed up
your morning.

1971
01:18:32.467 --> 01:18:33.800
but now it's because

1972
01:18:33.934 --> 01:18:35.467
I want you to have
more leisurely hours

1973
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.667
to spend with your friends.

1974
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.266
I'll help you
fold your laundry faster

1975
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.667
so that you can have
a laughter-filled dinner

1976
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.900
with your family...

1977
01:18:44.033 --> 01:18:45.734
[♪♪]

1978
01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:49.000
...adjust your daily routine
to fit in that newfound hobby.

1979
01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:52.133
that makes you feel alive.

1980
01:18:52.266 --> 01:18:54.500
[♪♪]

1981
01:18:57.967 --> 01:18:59.133
Because. in trying to help you

1982
01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:00.567
save time.

1983
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.066
I may have made you
miss out on things

1984
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.533
that could have brought you joy
or comfort

1985
01:19:05.667 --> 01:19:07.667
or fulfillment...

1986
01:19:09.033 --> 01:19:12.400
...and for that.
I am so sorry.

1987
01:19:12.533 --> 01:19:13.734
I recently realized

1988
01:19:13.867 --> 01:19:16.400
that. although my life
was full of activity.

1989
01:19:16.533 --> 01:19:18.066
there was nothing

1990
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200
that really mattered
to my heart...

1991
01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:22.333
like...

1992
01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:24.533
to really look
at the stars.

1993
01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:27.033
or noticing how

1994
01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:28.367
even a small smile
from someone

1995
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.200
can stay with you

1996
01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:31.967
long after they're gone.

1997
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.734
Or appreciating how

1998
01:19:33.867 --> 01:19:36.767
even strangers
can become a family.

1999
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.333
From now on.

2000
01:19:41.467 --> 01:19:44.233
I want to live every moment.

2001
01:19:44.367 --> 01:19:47.700
We only have so much time.

2002
01:19:47.834 --> 01:19:50.734
which is
our most precious commodity.

2003
01:19:50.867 --> 01:19:53.734
so we have to use it now

2004
01:19:53.867 --> 01:19:56.066
and use it well.

2005
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.533
I hope you'll join me.

2006
01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:01.166
[team applauds]

2007
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.166
All right.

2008
01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.467
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Exciting.

2009
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.066
[Sally chuckles]

2010
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.533
All set?

2011
01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:13.867
Yeah. we're officially
scaled down.

2012
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.033
Mm.

2013
01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:16.567
The pavilion will be up
and running in the spring.

2014
01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.066
and open for events.

2015
01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.133
No new guest rooms.

2016
01:20:20.266 --> 01:20:21.700
At least. for now.

2017
01:20:21.834 --> 01:20:24.567
I know your dad dreamed
about this expansion.

2018
01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.467
but he'd be happy
we're doing what's right for us.

2019
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.533
And he also would
want you to have this.

2020
01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.200
[♪♪]

2021
01:20:40.433 --> 01:20:41.533
[quietly] It's Dad's.

2022
01:20:41.667 --> 01:20:42.400
Yes. it is.

2023
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:43.867
[words catching]

2024
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.367
I can't.

2025
01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.667
Yes. you can.

2026
01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:50.066
I am excited for you.

2027
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.367
[chuckles]

2028
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.400
I'm nervous.

2029
01:20:56.533 --> 01:20:57.867
Well. then I'll be excited
for the both of us.

2030
01:20:59.367 --> 01:21:01.967
We are gonna be okay.

2031
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.066
I know you'll be.

2032
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.567
Thank you.

2033
01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.266
[smooch]

2034
01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:17.967
Ahem. Hello?

2035
01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:19.800
Lauren! Did I wake you up?

2036
01:21:19.934 --> 01:21:20.934
Sorry.

2037
01:21:21.066 --> 01:21:23.400
I'm so used to your
Friday morning spin classes.

2038
01:21:23.533 --> 01:21:25.200
but I guess
those are ancient history now.

2039
01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:26.266
A-a-anyways!

2040
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.467
Uh. I got our numbers back
from last week.

2041
01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.633
and they are high.

2042
01:21:30.767 --> 01:21:32.900
I think
we're keeping our audience.

2043
01:21:33.033 --> 01:21:36.233
And there's a bunch of interest
from other advertisers!

2044
01:21:36.367 --> 01:21:37.700
Really?

2045
01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:39.533
Yeah. some of them are even
talking about

2046
01:21:39.667 --> 01:21:40.734
partnerships.

2047
01:21:40.867 --> 01:21:41.700
There's a dog food company.

2048
01:21:41.834 --> 01:21:43.600
some "sound bath" place
in Florida...

2049
01:21:43.734 --> 01:21:44.934
you know what?

2050
01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.433
We'll talk about it
when you come in.

2051
01:21:46.567 --> 01:21:48.100
But no rush. [giggles]

2052
01:21:48.233 --> 01:21:49.800
That's my new catchphrase.
Do you like it?

2053
01:21:49.934 --> 01:21:51.934
I love it.

2054
01:21:52.066 --> 01:21:52.967
[chuckles]

2055
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.233
[♪♪]

2056
01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:14.033
[Jack sighs]

2057
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.967
Did you get to the part
about relaxing yet?

2058
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.333
No. but...

2059
01:22:23.467 --> 01:22:25.967
I'm kind of
a leisurely reader.

2060
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.834
Leisurely. huh?

2061
01:22:29.967 --> 01:22:30.834
[Lauren chuckles]

2062
01:22:30.967 --> 01:22:32.033
What are you doing here?

2063
01:22:35.734 --> 01:22:37.633
Well. I am

2064
01:22:37.767 --> 01:22:39.934
on my way
to the interview at Cornell

2065
01:22:40.066 --> 01:22:41.400
for the vet school.

2066
01:22:44.567 --> 01:22:47.133
Figured I'd come by
and say hello first. and...

2067
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.433
...maybe go the zoo.

2068
01:22:50.567 --> 01:22:52.867
Hmm.

2069
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.700
Your assistant thought
I might find you here.

2070
01:22:55.834 --> 01:22:57.667
Vet school. huh?

2071
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.700
Well. that is.
if they accept me.

2072
01:22:59.834 --> 01:23:02.233
I'd still have to retake
my first-year classes.

2073
01:23:02.367 --> 01:23:03.500
'cause it's been a minute.
you know.

2074
01:23:03.633 --> 01:23:05.333
And what about the retreat?

2075
01:23:05.467 --> 01:23:07.233
Well. we've. uh...

2076
01:23:07.367 --> 01:23:09.900
cut back on the expansion
quite a bit.

2077
01:23:10.033 --> 01:23:11.266
Kyle's working full-time now.

2078
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.066
and. uh...

2079
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.066
I think I might've found
my replacement.

2080
01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.700
It turns out I know
this financial expert

2081
01:23:17.834 --> 01:23:20.767
who's looking
for his next chapter.

2082
01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.166
and my mom convinced him

2083
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.200
to invest
in a family-run business.

2084
01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.700
-Roger?
-Roger.

2085
01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.233
[laughing]

2086
01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.667
Mm-hmm.

2087
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.100
You know. you were right--

2088
01:23:32.233 --> 01:23:33.934
about school.

2089
01:23:34.066 --> 01:23:36.066
about doing what I want
while I still have the time.

2090
01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:39.200
You were right. too.

2091
01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:40.066
You should do things

2092
01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.533
because
they're truly meaningful.

2093
01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:46.533
not just to say
you've done them.

2094
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.000
Does this mean
that I've inspired

2095
01:23:52.133 --> 01:23:54.100
a new chapter
of The 27-Hour Day?

2096
01:23:54.233 --> 01:23:55.367
Well...

2097
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.567
I guess I could give you
a little credit.

2098
01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.433
"A little credit"?

2099
01:23:58.567 --> 01:23:59.800
[laughs]

2100
01:24:03.266 --> 01:24:05.433
So...

2101
01:24:05.567 --> 01:24:08.266
how far away
is Cornell from here?

2102
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.600
I hear it's a quick flight--

2103
01:24:10.734 --> 01:24:12.700
not a lot of time
to get much done.

2104
01:24:13.867 --> 01:24:15.967
I could work with that.

2105
01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:18.600

2106
