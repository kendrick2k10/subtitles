Y'all see this fucking bat
in my hand.

45
00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:48.358
Bring your ass

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.693
I'ma knock
your fucking head off.

47
00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.444

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.446
OK?
We're sick of your shit.

49
00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.907
We're fighting back.
Don't you come up here.

50
00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.285
Knock your goddamn head
to the top of this arena.

51
00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.246
Don't you come up here.

52
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.708
We're about to have
a good time.

53
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.960
I'm excited.
I'm fucking excited.

54
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.671
[cheers and applause]

55
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.800
All right. listen.
I'ma be up here for a while.

56
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.302
I'ma talk about a lot
of shit while I'm up here.

57
00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:18.430
Some of the shit I say tonight
is gonna be mean.

58
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.849
Let it happen.
Unclench your ass.

59
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.476
Have a good time.
That's why you're here.

60
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.940
I think I want to start off
by talking about people.

61
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.316
That's where I want to start.

62
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.610
'cause I feel like people
are going backwards.

63
00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.279
We're taking steps
in the wrong direction.

64
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.322
People don't want
to be themselves anymore.

65
00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.992
People are goddamn
losing fucking confidence.

66
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.494
People are trying to change.
shape. and mold

67
00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.496
into shit
that doesn't even exist.

68
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.206
I'm talking
about plastic surgery.

69
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:48.001
Let's get into it.
I want to talk about it.

70
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.003
I want to talk about it.

71
00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.422
What the fuck is going on. man?

72
00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:56.885
What the fuck is going on?

73
00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.679
Plastic surgery
is at an all-time high.

74
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.014
I don't even know if you know
this. but back in the day.

75
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.432
plastic surgery was a secret.

76
00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.558
Like. nobody wanted anybody
to know that they

77
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.809
were getting work done.

78
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.354
It was all nose jobs
and titty jobs.

79
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.814
Nose. titties.
Nose. titties.

80
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.442
Nose. titties.
That's all it was.

81
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.569
Back in the day.
people got mad at they doctor.

82
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.738
You better not say shit about
what happened here today.

83
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.949
Only two people that we knew
that got work done

84
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.117
back in the day

85
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.827
was Dolly Parton
and Michael Jackson.

86
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.079
That's a fucking fact.

87
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.206
Those are the only two people.

88
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.665
Mike showed up
with that new nose.

89
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.334
We knew.
That's not your nose. Mike.

90
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.920
Something happened.

91
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.797
That's not the same nose.

92
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.883
Today it's different.
Everybody's getting work done.

93
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.385
Men. women.

94
00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.761
Women have taken it
to a new level. though.

95
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.722
The new shit that the women
are doing is the BBL.

96
00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.224
The BBL.

97
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.434
What the fuck?

98
00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.645
Jesus Christ.

99
00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.730
These bitches look like ants.

100
00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.024
That's right.
I said it.

101
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.236
They look like ants.

102
00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:57.862
Somebody's gotta say it.

103
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.409
Somebody's gotta say it.

104
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.743
And if you don't believe me.
I challenge you

105
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.453
to go look
at a picture of an ant

106
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.955
and tell me I'm fucking lying.

107
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.792
Big-ass head. little neck.

108
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.420
Hard chest.
skinny waist. fat ass.

109
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.964
You ever see an ant ass?

110
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.592
Ants got ass.
You ever see an ant ass?

111
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.177
If I was an insect.
I'd fuck an ant.

112
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.929
Swear to God. I'd do it.

113
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.141
Everybody wants change.

114
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.768
Everybody's looking for change.

115
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.062
A friend of mine's got
a huge forehead. right?

116
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.231
One of the worst foreheads I've
ever seen in my fucking life.

117
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.607
Huge.

118
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.026
He told me the other day.
he said. "Kev.

119
00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.528
I'm thinking about
getting my forehead reduced."

120
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.946
This is what he said to me.

121
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.531
I couldn't believe
what the fuck I heard.

122
00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.033
I said. "What the fuck
you just say to me?"

123
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.702
He said. "I'm thinking about
getting my forehand reduced.

124
00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.746
"I already talked to my doctor.
He said he can do it.

125
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.749
"The average forehead
is 4 fingers wide.

126
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.711
"He said I got an 8- to
12-finger situation going on.

127
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.547
But he can flip it down.
He said he can flip it down."

128
00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.467
Flip it down?

129
00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:01.634
Nigga. that's not a hat.

130
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.511
What are you talking about?

131
00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.139
It's your fucking
forehead. bitch.

132
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.390
What about your brain?

133
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.559
He said.
"Oh. he can push that back.

134
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.478
"He gonna push that back.

135
00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.563
Raise my eyes up
so I can see better."

136
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.357
I bet you fucking will.

137
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.486
Everybody wants change.

138
00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.280
LeBron James.
real good friend of mine.

139
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.615
Well. he was.

140
00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.116
He hasn't heard this joke yet.

141
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.451
We'll see what happens.

142
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.121
We'll see what happens.

143
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.082
I remember in the beginning
of LeBron career.

144
00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.416
he was going bald.

145
00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.293
His hair was real thin up top.

146
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:39.422
You could count the hairs
on top of his fucking head.

147
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.674
You know how I know that?

148
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.717
Because I was the one
counting the hairs

149
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.428
on top of his fucking head.

150
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.097
One.

151
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.736
Two-ish-ish.

152
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.407
I didn't see Bron
for. like. three weeks.

153
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.450
I didn't see him.
and I didn't talk to him.

154
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.411
Bron showed up
at a wedding I was at.

155
00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.621
He had a head full of hair.

156
00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.623
Walked in that bitch
with all this confidence

157
00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.041
like I didn't see him
three weeks ago

158
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.419
with the fucking truth
on his goddamn head.

159
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:20.338
He walked in. he was like.
"What up? What up? What up?

160
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.173
"What up? What up?
What up? What up?

161
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.175
What up? What's going on?"

162
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:28.096
I said. "What the fuck
is going on with you?

163
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.515
The fuck is that
on your goddamn head?"

164
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.142
People start kicking me.
"Chill. Kev. Chill."

165
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.477
I said. "Get your
fucking feet off of me.

166
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.937
"Ain't no chill.

167
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.189
I want to know what the fuck
that is on Bron head."

168
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.317
I'll tell you what it's not.
I knew what it wasn't.

169
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.986
I knew it wasn't
a goddamn toupee.

170
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.154
I knew that much.

171
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.031
You know how I knew
it wasn't a toupee?

172
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.450
Because they don't
make nigga toupees.

173
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.076
They never have.

174
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.455
They never have.

175
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.707
The fuck is that
on your head. LeBron?

176
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.126
Is it alive?
Is it alive?

177
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.130
Snatch it off right now.

178
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.550
I wanted to.

179
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.594
He's tall. I can't get--
no way I'm getting that.

180
00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.596
but you get what I'm saying.

181
00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.641
Everybody's looking for change.

182
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:14.851
I got an email from a guy

183
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.227
I went to high school with.
right?

184
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.520
Email said. "Kev. it's time
for you to get yours."

185
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:18.772
I open up the email.

186
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.565
It's two pictures in the email.

187
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.443
One picture was a real little
man standing next to a doctor.

188
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.903
He was angry.

189
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.323
Next picture.
that same little man

190
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:29.574
was taller than the doctor.

191
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.869
He was giving a thumbs-up.

192
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.287
Bottom of the email said.
"Kev. it's time for you

193
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.247
to get yours."

194
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.958
I'm confused.
What the fuck is going on?

195
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.210
I call him.
"Yo. I got your email.

196
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.378
"What the fuck
are you talking about?

197
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.671
What are you trying to say?"

198
00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:43.880
Said. "What do you mean.
what am I trying to say?"

199
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:44.839
Said. "Exactly what I said.
What is this?

200
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.965
What are you trying to say?"

201
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.050
He said.
"They're giving out height.

202
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.843
Go get you some."

203
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.304
"The fuck you mean.
they giving out height?"

204
00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.306
"Exactly what I said.
They're giving out height.

205
00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.642
"They're taking the fat
out of people backs.

206
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.186
putting it in their knees."

207
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.820
"They taking the fat
out of people backs.

208
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.905
putting it in their knees."

209
00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.657
He said. "Go get rid
of your back fat.

210
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.451
Get yourself some inches."

211
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.329
I said.
"I will do no such thing."

212
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.665
Get rid of my goddamn back fat.

213
00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.959
43 years old.

214
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.169
I've been 5'5" my whole life--

215
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.007
5'4"--5'2 1/2"
my whole fucking life.

216
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.178
Don't have to do no shit
like that.

217
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.889
You gotta remember. I ain't
been on tour. like. four years.

218
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.809
I can't just walk out
this bitch 6'6"

219
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.311
and not say shit about it.

220
00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.439
I just walk out.
What up? What up? What up?

221
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.606
What up? What up?
What up? What up?

222
00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.358
What up?
What up?

223
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.610
What's going on?

224
00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.447
What the fuck
is going on with you?

225
00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:51.698
Look at his goddamn knees.

226
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.117
What he do to his knees?

227
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.827
Why he got all them holes
in his back?

228
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.912
What the fuck
he do to his back?

229
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.208
You know what I want?

230
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.502
I want people to start
thinking shit through.

231
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.213
I want to get back to the times
when people had patience.

232
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.674
You gotta slow down.
start thinking shit through.

233
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.176
Stop acting on impulse.

234
00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.802
Let's say
I go get the procedure.

235
00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:16.014
I come out of it with these new
knees and these long-ass legs.

236
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.265
I'm 6'6".

237
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:20.727
Look at my fucking knees
and these long-ass legs.

238
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.103
But I still got the same arms.

239
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:26.066
I didn't do shit
to my fucking arms.

240
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.902
I didn't judge it right.

241
00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.278
Now I can't put
my hands in my pocket

242
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.155
'cause I done fucked up.

243
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.408
I'm out this bitch
looking like a T. rex.

244
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.660
touching my chest all the time.

245
00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:40.747
Why Kev always
rubbing his chest?

246
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.248
Bitch. 'cause I misjudged it.

247
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.334
I can't get my hands
in my pockets.

248
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.212
You gotta think shit through.

249
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.880
Let's say
I go get the procedure.

250
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.800
I got these goddamn new knees.
long-ass legs.

251
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.760
My fucking frame. look at
my chest and my shoulders.

252
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:57.347
I'm 6'6". but I still
wear a size 7 sneaker.

253
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.933
I didn't do shit to my feet.

254
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.768
Now I can't support
the new body.

255
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.020
My balance is off.

256
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.523
I look like that thing
that be at the car dealerships.

257
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.484
that man--that air man.

258
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.820
Look at me.

259
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.948
You gotta think shit through.

260
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.075
Stop acting on impulse.

261
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.912
We're in a crazy time
right now.

262
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.581
We're in a real crazy time.
By the way. rightfully so.

263
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.833
We've been through a lot.

264
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.292
Pandemic hit us hard.

265
00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.086
Pandemic sat us all down
with nothing to do.

266
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.921
gave us nothing
but time to think.

267
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.131
That's when people get weird.

268
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.133
when they fucking think
all goddamn day.

269
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.593
Just thinking about shit
with nothing to do.

270
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.304
That's why a lot of weird shit
happened after the pandemic.

271
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.764
I'ma tell you
the weirdest invention

272
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.433
in my opinion that came
out of the pandemic.

273
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.600
this Metaverse shit.

274
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.977
I don't even know
if you know what it is.

275
00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.395
For those who do not know
what the Metaverse is.

276
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.147
I'll do my best
to explain it to you.

277
00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.983
The Metaverse was created
for people that don't want

278
00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:52.360
to be here in the real world.

279
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.237
So they can go there
and do shit there

280
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.905
with the people
that don't like them here

281
00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.866
but they don't know that
they are who they are there.

282
00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.659
That's what the fuck it is.
right?

283
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.036
It's some weird shit.

284
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.413
It's a lot of weird shit
happening in the Metaverse.

285
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.040
There was a story about a woman
who says she got

286
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.500
sexually assaulted
in the Metaverse.

287
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.002
This is real shit.
You can Google this.

288
00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:11.212
This is Googleable information.

289
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.756
Says she got
sexually assaulted.

290
00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:13.965
They gave it time and energy.

291
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.133
They interviewed her.

292
00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.010
"Are you OK?
How do you feel?"

293
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.346
That's what they said.
"How do you feel?"

294
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.097
Nobody said.

295
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.768
"Bitch. why didn't you
close the laptop. huh?

296
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.186
"Huh?

297
00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.063
"Why didn't you take
the headset off?

298
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.482
You just sitting there
letting it happen."

299
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.735
[yelling]

300
00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.949
"Make it stop."

301
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.827
Bitch. take the goddamn
headset off.

302
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.874
Close the laptop.
with your stupid ass.

303
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.918
Sitting there taking
a virtual assaulting.

304
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.920
with your stupid as.

305
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.381
You know what I want to do?

306
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.882
I want to get back
to the times when you can

307
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.425
tell people. shut the fuck up.

308
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.718
Sit your dumb ass down.

309
00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.928
I want to go back there.

310
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.806
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.557
I want to go back
to those times.

312
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:05.600
Shut the fuck up.

313
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.561
Sit your dumb ass down.

314
00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.272
We're giving too much
too much attention.

315
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.983
We're entertaining
the crazy way too much.

316
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.193
Let me tell you
something. people.

317
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.696
The crazy are only
going to get crazier.

318
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.905
That's not fiction.

319
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.448
That's a fact.
It's a fact.

320
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.951
You gotta stop
entertaining the shit.

321
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.161
I don't entertain it
personally. right?

322
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:26.454
I don't.
I really don't. man.

323
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.956
Like. I'ma tell you what.

324
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.458
I feel like I live
in the crazy.

325
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.377
I'm in the fucking crazy.

326
00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.087
I do.
I really do feel like that.

327
00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.089
Like. there's times
where I actually.

328
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.383
like. want to know
if I'm crazy

329
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:42.137
or why I'm not as crazy
as I feel like I should be.

330
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.263
'Cause I've been
through a lot of shit.

331
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.141
On paper. I should
be fucking crazy.

332
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.559
On paper. all the shit
I've been through?

333
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.519
I should be fucking crazy.
And who knows?

334
00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:50.687
Maybe it's coming.

335
00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.106
Maybe I got crazy
waiting on me.

336
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.274
'Cause you don't expect it.

337
00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.776
Nobody plans to be crazy.
It just happens.

338
00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.945
Crazy just sneaks up on you.

339
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.697
Look at Will Smith.
He didn't plan that.

340
00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.323
That just happened.

341
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.410
What?
He didn't plan that.

342
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.454
It just fucking happened.

343
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.914
"Keep my wife's name
out your motherfucking mouth."

344
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.958
Come on. man.

345
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.835
He didn't fucking plan that.

346
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:20.633
"Keep my wife's name
out your motherfucking mouth."

347
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.053
He jumped out his goddamn body.

348
00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:27.223
You have any idea how crazy
you gotta be to make

349
00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.850
Samuel L. Jackson jump back?

350
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.019
Do you have any idea?

351
00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.313
"Keep my wife's name"--

352
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.356
"Say.
what the fuck happening. Jack?

353
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:36.524
Goddamn."

354
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:39.986
I'm next.

355
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:43.156
I know it.
I feel like I'm next.

356
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.407
It's a lot of shit
going on. man.

357
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.368
I'm fucking stressed
the fuck out.

358
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.410
I'm about to pop.

359
00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.454
I'm telling y'all
ahead of time.

360
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.997
Y'all gonna see me
at a gas station

361
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.165
with my dick in the tank soon.

362
00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.458
Something stupid gonna happen.

363
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:55.835
"Kev. what you doing?"

364
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:56.878
"Getting gas.

365
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.672
Mind your fucking
business. bitch."

366
00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:03.051
"Keep my wife's name
out your motherfucking mouth."

367
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.469
It's coming.

368
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.306
You know the crazy thing?

369
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.183
I've realized
that I live in the crazy.

370
00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.643
Like. I live in Los Angeles.

371
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.645
I feel like Los Angeles
is the craziest place ever.

372
00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.689
I call Los Angeles
the land of the lost.

373
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.856
and here's the thing.

374
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.191
It's not the people
from Los Angeles.

375
00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.567
They're fine.
It's not them.

376
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.902
It's the people
that move out there.

377
00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:23.363
the people with dreams.
goals. ambitions.

378
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.823
'Cause they want
all this shit to happen.

379
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.616
They move out there.
and then it doesn't happen.

380
00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:28.952
and they go. welp.
it's time to be nuts.

381
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.079
They fucking lose it.

382
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:34.040
They lose it.

383
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.375
You gotta watch the news
in Los Angeles.

384
00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.085
I've never seen
anything like it.

385
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:38.545
There was a story
on the news about a guy

386
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:39.879
who was going to Denny's.

387
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.133
putting his dick in people
breakfast at 7:00 a.m.

388
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.844
7:00 a.m.. slamming his dick
in people grits.

389
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.097
[grunting]

390
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.725
They call him the dick slammer.

391
00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.436
This is true shit.

392
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.896
Fucking up Grand Slams
nationwide.

393
00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.649
[grunting]

394
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.568
They reported it live
from Denny's.

395
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:05.739
There was a news anchor
live in front of Denny's.

396
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.407
He said.
"Welp. he did it again."

397
00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.993
What?

398
00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.161
"You're at Denny's.
watch your back.

399
00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.287
and watch your breakfast."

400
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.122
What?

401
00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.957
Telling me I can't eat
breakfast without looking

402
00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.625
over my shoulder
for stray dick?

403
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.669
Are you kidding me?

404
00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.380
It's too much crazy.

405
00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.300
The reason why I feel
like honestly I could be

406
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.552
or. like. I have the potential
to be crazy.

407
00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:28.720
'cause I'm around it.

408
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.764
Crazy friends. crazy family.

409
00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.057
My brother just got crazy.

410
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.641
It just happened.

411
00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.684
He turned 50.

412
00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:35.935
The next day.
the nigga got weird.

413
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.937
He got fucking weird.

414
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.773
Called me with some weird shit.

415
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.441
He's like. "Kev. I'm thinking
about getting a dog.

416
00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.359
I'm lonely."

417
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.360
I said. "You should get a dog.

418
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.903
A dog would be good for you."

419
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.196
He's like. "Yeah. but I don't
know if I'd be a good owner.

420
00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.322
"You know what I'ma do?

421
00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:48.698
"I'ma act like a dog
for two weeks.

422
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.325
see how that go."

423
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:58.333
You ever hear somebody you love
say some crazy shit to you

424
00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:00.251
and you don't say nothing back
'cause you hope they say.

425
00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.629
"I'm just fucking with you."
and they never do?

426
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.507
I didn't know what to say.
I just got off the phone.

427
00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.550
I was like. "All right.
Well. let me let you go. man.

428
00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.760
Hit me when you figure it out."

429
00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.304
I just got off the phone.

430
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.598
He called me a week later.
6:00 in the morning.

431
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.641
"Kev. you up?"

432
00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:16.559
I said. "I am now.
What's going on?"

433
00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:20.146
He said. "Ain't shit.
I'm out here walking this dog."

434
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.189
I said. "You got the dog?"

435
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:22.190
He said. "No. but if I had it.

436
00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.316
"this when I'd be walking it.

437
00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.943
I'm just trying to see
how it feel."

438
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.404
He said. "I'm mad 'cause
he won't go to the bathroom."

439
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.407
What the fuck is going on?

440
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.658
Now I'm worried.
but it's my brother.

441
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.077
so I don't want
to fuck with him too much.

442
00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.787
So I participate.
This is what fucked me up.

443
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:39.165
I go--I said. "Are you
walking him on grass?"

444
00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:42.085
This is what fucked me up.

445
00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:44.129
I said. "Are you
walking him on grass?"

446
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.047
My brother said.
"Ah. that's what it is.

447
00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.048
I'll call you back."

448
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.299
Oh!

449
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.344
Oh!

450
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.763
He's a fucking psychopath!

451
00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.057
It's Jeffrey Dahmer
all over again.

452
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:59.227
The lights are on.
Nobody's home.

453
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.523
A week later. he called me
and said. "Kev.

454
00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.650
it's not gonna work.
I'm not getting a dog."

455
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.235
I said. "Why not?"
He said. "'Cause he got loose.

456
00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.570
He ran away."

457
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:11.406
Do you know how crazy
you gotta be

458
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:12.866
to lose an imaginary dog?

459
00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.202
Do you have any idea
how fucking crazy you gotta be?

460
00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.704
I said. "Just act
like he came back.

461
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.373
Pretend like the dog
came back."

462
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.709
He said. "It's not
that easy. Kevin.

463
00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:26.379
"Plus. I just put the signs up
around the neighborhood

464
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.881
trying to see if I get a call."

465
00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.424
Oh!

466
00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.134
He's a fucking psychopath!

467
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.474
My dad is crazy.

468
00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.184
For those who do not know.
I just lost my dad.

469
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.143
like. a week and a half ago.

470
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.227
My dad just passed away.

471
00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.271
Not a sad moment.
Don't do that.

472
00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:44.564
We're not gonna make it
a sad moment.

473
00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.274
This is a celebration.
Here's why.

474
00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.734
Because of what I do
for a living.

475
00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.861
I get to fucking let the legend
of my dad live on.

476
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.654
So we talk about my dad.

477
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.114
We celebrate my dad.

478
00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.657
OK?

479
00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.659
It's a celebration.

480
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.119
For those who have
followed my comedy.

481
00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.829
you know I've talked about
my dad throughout my career.

482
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.039
Everything I said is true.

483
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.208
It's all true.
all the sayings.

484
00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.250
All right. all right.
all right.

485
00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.210
You gonna learn today.
Long dick.

486
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.169
Say it with your chest.

487
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.879
It's all fucking true.

488
00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.591
My dad passed away from COPD.
right?

489
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.259
For those who do not know
what COPD is.

490
00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.844
it's like an elevated
version of asthma.

491
00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.388
My dad was on oxygen.
He had the tube

492
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.932
hooked up to his nose.
oxygen tank in the corner.

493
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.101
You go over his house.
this is all you saw.

494
00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.728
Just a bunch of fucking tube.

495
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.188
He was an old man
that couldn't breathe

496
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.398
that talked shit all day.

497
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.441
That's all he did.

498
00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.694
Told the bitch
don't come over here.

499
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.614
My dad thought
everybody had COVID.

500
00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:37.075
Don't let that bitch
in here with COVID.

501
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.660
It's all on the hands.

502
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:39.744
Look at the hands.

503
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:42.455
Funny thing about
my dad is that he

504
00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:43.623
still thought he was tough.

505
00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:44.916
My friends would
fuck with him just

506
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.376
to get a reaction out of him.

507
00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:47.794
My friend Wayne said.
"Spoon. I'll come over there

508
00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.713
and whup your ass.
knock that oxygen tank over."

509
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:50.755
My dad got mad.

510
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.132
He said. "Bitch.
say something else.

511
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.843
I'll turn this tank up 20%.
give myself a boost."

512
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.179
He started fucking
with the tank.

513
00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.641
[mimicking air hissing]

514
00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.309
20 seconds.
Start the clock right now.

515
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.186
I'll fuck your ass up.

516
00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.940
He's a character.

517
00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.026
The thing about my dad is.
because he couldn't breathe.

518
00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.235
there was a rule.

519
00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.987
The rule was.
no surprising my dad.

520
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.155
No surprising him.

521
00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.656
He couldn't take it.
It's too much.

522
00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.366
[gasping]

523
00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.285
He couldn't take.

524
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.288
[grunting]

525
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.998
He couldn't take it.

526
00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.877
I saw him almost die
one time. one time.

527
00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.128
We was in the kitchen.

528
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.296
The tube got caught
under the stove.

529
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.964
I didn't see it.

530
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.632
I thought he had the hiccups.

531
00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:38.970
I did.

532
00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.305
[gasping]

533
00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:41.890
That's what he did.

534
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.850
[gasping]

535
00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.019
Fuck wrong with you?

536
00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.188
You want some water?

537
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:51.691
For a second.
for a quick second.

538
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.151
I thought my brother dog
was in there.

539
00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.527
For a quick second.

540
00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.614
I said. that dog came here.

541
00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:00.450
I think that dog is in here.

542
00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:01.868
Then I realized
he couldn't breathe.

543
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.203
I said. "Oh. shit. Dad.
you can't breathe.

544
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.371
I got you."

545
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.705
I started chasing the tube.

546
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.749
I found a little kink
in the tube this big.

547
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:08.875
I straightened it out.
[grunts]

548
00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.460
I got you. Dad.

549
00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.045
You would've thought somebody
shot my dad in the ass

550
00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.380
with adrenaline.

551
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:14.381
I've never seen anybody
take a deeper breath

552
00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.715
in my fucking life.

553
00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:19.552
[inhales deeply]

554
00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:23.098
He said. "You see what
the devil tried to do to me?"

555
00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.809
Ain't no goddamn devil.
It's too much tube.

556
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:29.854
I'll talk a lot of shit
about my dad.

557
00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.523
but it come
from a place of love.

558
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.149
My dad had good qualities too.

559
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.984
My dad is by far
one of the best

560
00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.403
nickname givers on the planet.

561
00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:37.904
When it comes
to giving out nicknames.

562
00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:38.863
there's nobody better.

563
00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.240
Every nickname
that he has given

564
00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.616
has lasted a lifetime.

565
00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:43.243
Keep in mind.
everybody wants a nickname.

566
00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.704
You just don't have the right
people giving them to you.

567
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.039
Everyone has fucking landed.

568
00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.249
Here's a secret.

569
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.500
The secret to giving out
good nicknames

570
00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:51.668
is that they gotta come
from a mean place.

571
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.753
Good nicknames
are mean-spirited.

572
00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.549
I got an uncle.
My uncle had a stroke.

573
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.758
His whole left side
is shut down.

574
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.594
His whole left side is dead.
can't move it.

575
00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:02.971
My dad called him Right Foot.

576
00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.724
This is a true story.

577
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.017
It's not rocket science.
It's simple.

578
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.435
It was actually too simple.

579
00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:09.894
I said. "Dad. why you
call him Right Foot?"

580
00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.146
He said. "You ever see him
move his left?"

581
00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.356
"No."
"All right.

582
00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.150
"There it is.

583
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.110
There it is."

584
00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.029
Called my uncle Right Foot.
He get excited.

585
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.613
"Right foot. what it is?"

586
00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.490
"Hey. you already know what the
fuck going on. god damn it."

587
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.659
My uncle turned
into a human typewriter.

588
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:25.660
Goddamn.

589
00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:28.955
I got an aunt.

590
00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:31.708
I got an aunt.
He calls my aunt Wings.

591
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.876
Wings.

592
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.836
She got that stuff
under her arm.

593
00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.296
You know that stuff
that women can't get rid of.

594
00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.881
that little piece?

595
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:38.965
You know what I'm
talking about.

596
00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:41.551
that piece that be up
under there?

597
00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:43.470
I never knew why he
called her Wings.

598
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.221
One day. she was
in the kitchen going off.

599
00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.098
"Tired of y'all coming over
here. not closing the doors.

600
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.141
eating up all the food."

601
00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:49.309
It was making a bunch of noise.

602
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:51.436
Pat. pat. pat. pat.
pat. pat.

603
00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.481
He tapped me. said. "Kev.

604
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.107
"Look. look. look. look.
look. look. look. look.

605
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.275
"She about to take off.

606
00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:59.819
"Fly. Wings.

607
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.112
Fly."

608
00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:04.532
"Yeah."

609
00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:07.786
I love it when I
tell that joke.

610
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.121
'cause I can see some women
in the front grab they arm.

611
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:12.665
Shut up. Kevin.
Shut up.

612
00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.417
You don't even--shut up.

613
00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.338
There's only one nickname
that he gave out

614
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.381
that fucked me up
a little bit.

615
00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:21.049
One.

616
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.509
He got a little nephew.

617
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.635
Little boy name is Calvin.

618
00:22:23.677 --> 00:22:25.470
My dad called him Crazy Horse.

619
00:22:25.512 --> 00:22:27.389
"Crazy Horse. come here.

620
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.641
Crazy Horse. get over here."

621
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.476
Now. before I go on
with the rest of the joke.

622
00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:33.228
I'ma tell you right now.
hand on the Bible.

623
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.147
swear to God. I had no idea
that this boy was special.

624
00:22:36.189 --> 00:22:38.024
OK?

625
00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:39.651
I did not know.

626
00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:40.652
I'm getting that out the way.

627
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:42.862
I'm telling you that now.

628
00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:44.197
'cause I don't want you
to think I'm a dickhead

629
00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:45.657
after I say what I say.

630
00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:48.368
I'm still gonna tell you
what the fuck I saw.

631
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.995
but I wanted to get that out.

632
00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.372
Kept calling the boy
Crazy Horse.

633
00:22:52.414 --> 00:22:53.873
"Crazy Horse. come here."

634
00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:55.667
"I said. dad. why you keep
calling that boy Crazy Horse?"

635
00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:58.920
He said. "You never
seen him do it?"

636
00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:00.505
I said. "Do what?"

637
00:23:02.007 --> 00:23:03.174
[laughs]

638
00:23:06.177 --> 00:23:07.929
I said. "Do what?"

639
00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:09.055
He said. "Crazy Horse.
come here."

640
00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:10.390
It was quick.

641
00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:11.850
If you blinked. you would
have fucking missed it.

642
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:13.727
If you blink. I swear to God.
you would've missed it.

643
00:23:13.768 --> 00:23:14.853
"Crazy Horse. come here."

644
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.771
The boy got up. he's like--

645
00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.107
Took off.

646
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:29.576
No!

647
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.745
No!

648
00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:34.664
Can't call that boy
no fucking Crazy Horse.

649
00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:37.459
He said. "Why not?
That's my nephew."

650
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.252
I don't give a fuck
who he is.

651
00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:41.379
'Cause of the times. you can't
treat people like that

652
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.298
because of the times.

653
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.550
He got mad. started
adjusting his oxygen tank.

654
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.927
[mimicking air hissing]

655
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:49.596
"Yell at me again.
I'll fuck your ass up.

656
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.639
20 seconds.
Start the clock right now."

657
00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:55.935
Crazy Horse.

658
00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:57.562
You know. man. my dad
is such a character.

659
00:23:57.604 --> 00:23:59.356
Like. when I think about
my dad and my brother.

660
00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:00.607
the thing that
I've realized now

661
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:02.817
is that we represent
one generation. right?

662
00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:05.278
We're a generation
of men in our family.

663
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.614
And I'm like. damn. now
I got four kids. two sons.

664
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.783
Holy shit.
That's the next generation.

665
00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:11.785
Had to give myself a reality
check. because I've realized

666
00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:14.537
I don't think I'm doing my job
preparing them

667
00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:16.206
to be a better generation
than what we are.

668
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:17.916
I'm passing down bad habits.

669
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.417
This is not a hypothetical.

670
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:21.294
This is a fact.
I know I am.

671
00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:23.713
My bad habits are being
passed down. like my patience.

672
00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:24.964
I don't have patience.

673
00:24:25.006 --> 00:24:26.216
This is one
of my worst qualities.

674
00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:27.258
I get irritated very fast.

675
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.718
Small things make me mad.

676
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.969
This is not a joke.

677
00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:31.221
This is an example.
'cause I want you

678
00:24:31.262 --> 00:24:32.138
to understand what I'm saying.

679
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.348
I don't like it when people eat

680
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.516
and sweat at the same time.

681
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.226
I don't fucking like it.

682
00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:37.227
I don't fucking
like it.

683
00:24:37.268 --> 00:24:38.395
Like. if somebody's eating

684
00:24:38.436 --> 00:24:39.938
and while they eat.
they be like. whew.

685
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.439
I'll punch you
in the fucking face.

686
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:42.857
If I'm there.
I swear to God.

687
00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:44.025
I'll punch you
in the fucking face.

688
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:46.069
Slow down!

689
00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:47.570
Ain't nobody gonna take
that food from you.

690
00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:48.988
Slow down!

691
00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:51.950
Tell you what else
I don't like.

692
00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:53.743
You're not gonna like it.
but I'ma tell you anyway.

693
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.704
I've recently realized
that I don't have any patience

694
00:24:55.745 --> 00:24:56.996
for unattractive people.

695
00:24:57.038 --> 00:24:58.665
There. I said it.
That's how I feel.

696
00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:01.459
I know when you first
hear it. it's a blow.

697
00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:02.961
It's a blow at first.

698
00:25:03.003 --> 00:25:04.462
I ask that you stay with me.

699
00:25:04.504 --> 00:25:06.548
OK?
Stay with me until the end.

700
00:25:06.589 --> 00:25:07.799
I feel like they're very needy.

701
00:25:07.841 --> 00:25:09.884
Unattractive people
are very needy.

702
00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.428
They always want something.

703
00:25:11.469 --> 00:25:14.055
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

704
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.767
Excuse me.
You know where I can--

705
00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:20.186
No. I don't.
No.

706
00:25:20.228 --> 00:25:21.938
No. No.

707
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.398
I treat them like fucking cats.

708
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.774
Get your ass out of here.

709
00:25:26.484 --> 00:25:28.695
Get out of here!
You better get!

710
00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:32.699
It's too much.

711
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:33.867
It's too fucking much.

712
00:25:33.908 --> 00:25:34.993
Let me tell you
where the joke came from

713
00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:36.870
so you don't think
I'm a dick. OK?

714
00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:39.122
I was at the bank. right?
I get done at the bank.

715
00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:40.206
I'm in my car.

716
00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:41.583
I'm about to pull out
the parking lot.

717
00:25:41.624 --> 00:25:43.001
You gotta stop at the little
parking booth. right?

718
00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.085
You gotta give the guy
your ticket.

719
00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:45.337
I go to give the guy my ticket.

720
00:25:45.378 --> 00:25:46.880
He slide the glass back.
sticks his head out.

721
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:49.257
Very unattractive man.
Whatever.

722
00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:51.551
He sees me.
When he saw me. he lost it.

723
00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:52.802
He got excited.

724
00:25:52.844 --> 00:25:54.888
He's like. uh-uh. uh-uh. uh-uh.

725
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:59.934
Uh-uh. uh-uh. uh-uh. uh-uh-uh.

726
00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:02.687
Made that ugly-ass face
right in my fucking face.

727
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.358
Kevin Hart in my bank?
You got to be kidding me.

728
00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:07.859
He said. "I'm not letting you
out of here until you

729
00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:09.486
"tell me why you chose us.
Why us?

730
00:26:09.527 --> 00:26:10.904
"Why you bank with us?

731
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:14.366
Why'd you choose us
as your financial institution?"

732
00:26:14.407 --> 00:26:15.825
I couldn't believe
what the fuck I heard.

733
00:26:15.867 --> 00:26:18.328
I said. "I don't have time
for this shit.

734
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.205
"Press the button.
Let me the fuck out of here.

735
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:21.831
I don't have time."

736
00:26:21.873 --> 00:26:24.876
He did it again.
Uh-uh. uh-uh-uh. uh-uh.

737
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.253
"I ain't letting you out of
here till you tell me why us.

738
00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:28.463
"Why'd you choose us?

739
00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:30.674
Why us?
Why'd you choose us?"

740
00:26:30.715 --> 00:26:31.925
Kept saying us.

741
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:33.176
I told you
I don't have any patience.

742
00:26:33.218 --> 00:26:34.427
I fucking lost it.
I snapped.

743
00:26:34.469 --> 00:26:35.845
I said. "Stop saying us.

744
00:26:35.887 --> 00:26:37.305
"You don't got shit to do
with that goddamn bank.

745
00:26:37.347 --> 00:26:39.808
"This parking lot ain't got
shit to do with that bank.

746
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:41.101
"Hit the button.

747
00:26:41.142 --> 00:26:43.978
Let me the fuck up
out of here."

748
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.647
This when I got mad.
He looked me dead in the eye.

749
00:26:45.689 --> 00:26:47.148
He said. "I got all day.
Kevin Hart.

750
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.109
All day."

751
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.069
I realized he's not playing.
He's not gonna let me out.

752
00:26:51.111 --> 00:26:52.487
I gotta answer
his fucking question.

753
00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:54.572
"OK. fine. you want to know
why I chose this bank?

754
00:26:54.614 --> 00:26:57.117
"Your customer service.
loan rates. free checking.

755
00:26:57.158 --> 00:26:59.619
There you go. That's why.
That's why I chose y'all."

756
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:00.787
This is what pissed me off.

757
00:27:00.829 --> 00:27:02.080
He goes. "That's all
you had to say.

758
00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:03.623
with your little ugly ass."

759
00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:05.792
I said. "What'd you just say?

760
00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:06.918
The fuck did you
just say to me?"

761
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.420
"Get your ugly ass
out my line."

762
00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:11.548
He hit the button.
I had to pull off.

763
00:27:11.589 --> 00:27:13.216
[mimicking tires squealing]

764
00:27:13.258 --> 00:27:14.718
Now I'm pissed.

765
00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:15.677
I'm not ugly.

766
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.137
You ugly!

767
00:27:19.264 --> 00:27:20.974
Fucking pissed.

768
00:27:21.016 --> 00:27:24.102
I stopped at Chipotle
two blocks up.

769
00:27:24.144 --> 00:27:25.812
It's a long line in Chipotle.

770
00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:27.022
Now I'm even more irritated.

771
00:27:27.063 --> 00:27:28.398
I'm only in this long-ass line

772
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.484
because of that
unattractive-ass conversation.

773
00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.653
While I'm standing in line.
the woman behind me goes.

774
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:34.654
"Oh. my God.
today's such a nice day.

775
00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:35.822
It's so beautiful outside."

776
00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:37.198
I'm about to fucking snap.

777
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.324
I'ma lose it.

778
00:27:38.366 --> 00:27:39.784
I'ma fucking snap.
I'ma turn around.

779
00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:40.952
I'ma let this goddamn woman
have it.

780
00:27:40.994 --> 00:27:42.287
I turn around.
I see her.

781
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:44.205
This is by far one
of the most attractive women

782
00:27:44.247 --> 00:27:45.373
I've ever seen
in my fucking life.

783
00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:46.791
She was gorgeous.
Immediately. instantly...

784
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:48.626
[snaps fingers]

785
00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:50.670
I had time.
I had fucking time.

786
00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:52.297
I said. "You know what?

787
00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:54.466
It is a nice day.
It's so nice outside."

788
00:27:55.884 --> 00:27:56.926
I turned into
a fucking weatherman.

789
00:27:56.968 --> 00:27:58.219
I said. "What we need is rain.

790
00:27:58.261 --> 00:28:00.764
We ain't had no rain
in a minute."

791
00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.349
She said. "I wasn't even
talking to you."

792
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.517
Turned her back on me.

793
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:06.186
What the fuck?

794
00:28:06.227 --> 00:28:08.438
Oh. no. No.
That is not acceptable.

795
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.107
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

796
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:13.777
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

797
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:16.071
She turned around.
"What?"

798
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:18.656
Aha!

799
00:28:18.698 --> 00:28:20.241
Ah.

800
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:25.413
Ah.

801
00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:30.126
I just want--

802
00:28:30.168 --> 00:28:32.212
"I just want to know
what made you choose Chipotle

803
00:28:32.253 --> 00:28:34.422
as your place for lunch today."

804
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:37.217
She said.
"I'm not telling you that."

805
00:28:37.258 --> 00:28:39.719
I said. "Uh-uh. uh-uh.
uh-uh-uh."

806
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:44.057
I was the unattractive person
in that conversation.

807
00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:45.266
Guy flipped it on me that fast.

808
00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:46.476
Let me tell you
something. people.

809
00:28:46.518 --> 00:28:48.061
No matter how good
you think you look.

810
00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:51.231
I promise you that you don't
look that fucking good.

811
00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:53.191
I promise you
something will happen

812
00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:56.152
in life to show you that you
don't look that fucking good.

813
00:28:56.194 --> 00:28:58.113
My wife gave me
a reality check.

814
00:28:58.154 --> 00:29:00.115
We was in the bed. watching TV.

815
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:01.908
Commercial came on
with the little monster

816
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.076
from "Lord of the Rings."
Smeagol.

817
00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:04.494
I think that's his name.

818
00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:05.870
Smeagol. he was doing
this shit right here.

819
00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:07.247
You know the little monster?

820
00:29:07.288 --> 00:29:08.707
That's what he did.
He was doing this shit.

821
00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:10.917
My wife said. "Oh. my God.
babe. you be doing that."

822
00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:14.004
I said. "Bitch.
what did you just say to me?

823
00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:15.380
The fuck did you just say?"

824
00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:17.090
"You be doing that
in the mornings."

825
00:29:17.132 --> 00:29:18.925
"Bitch. I ain't never did
no shit like that

826
00:29:18.967 --> 00:29:20.760
in my goddamn life!"

827
00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:24.472
Called me a fucking monster
to my goddamn face.

828
00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:29.477
Self-esteem was fucking dead
after that.

829
00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.563
Crushed my soul.

830
00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:34.441
I'll tell you what really
destroyed my self-esteem.

831
00:29:34.482 --> 00:29:36.276
what destroyed it.

832
00:29:36.317 --> 00:29:39.279
Fan art.

833
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.572
That's right.

834
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:42.032
Fan art.

835
00:29:42.073 --> 00:29:44.784
The pictures that you
are drawing of me

836
00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:47.662
and have given to me in person.

837
00:29:47.704 --> 00:29:49.789
The nerve of some of you.

838
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:52.083
Like. listen. I--fuck you.

839
00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:54.461
And I mean that.
Like. I stand on that.

840
00:29:54.502 --> 00:29:57.839
Fuck you.
acting like these pictures

841
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:59.507
come from a place of love.

842
00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:02.010
It's got to be--it's the most
irritating shit in the world.

843
00:30:02.052 --> 00:30:03.553
You think--let me
show you something.

844
00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:05.221
Put one of them pictures up.
Look at this shit.

845
00:30:05.263 --> 00:30:07.140
Look.
Look at this.

846
00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:08.391
These are real pictures.
by the way.

847
00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:10.185
These are real
fucking pictures.

848
00:30:10.226 --> 00:30:11.686
Look at my goddamn mouth.

849
00:30:11.728 --> 00:30:13.021
When did I have a stroke?

850
00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:15.273
Does anybody know
when I had a stroke?

851
00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:17.108
Show another one.
Show another--look.

852
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.610
Look at this shit.

853
00:30:18.651 --> 00:30:21.029
Look at this shit.
Now I'm Frankenstein. huh?

854
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:22.614
I'm fucking Frankenstein?

855
00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:23.907
Look at my fucking forehead.

856
00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:25.408
Goddamn.

857
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.369
What the fuck?
Look at the next one.

858
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.745
What color am I?

859
00:30:28.787 --> 00:30:30.538
What the fuck color am I?

860
00:30:32.374 --> 00:30:33.458
Cut it off.

861
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.043
I mean. it's just--
it's so much. man.

862
00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:36.294
I'ma tell you who drew. like.

863
00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:37.379
one of the worst pieces
of fan art.

864
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.421
You should know.

865
00:30:38.463 --> 00:30:39.464
Who do you think gave me

866
00:30:39.506 --> 00:30:40.507
one of the worst pieces
of fan art

867
00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:41.424
that I've ever seen?

868
00:30:41.466 --> 00:30:43.802
Think.
[indistinct shouting]

869
00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:45.762
No.
No.

870
00:30:45.804 --> 00:30:47.013
Crazy Horse.

871
00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:50.183
Crazy Horse gave me
a picture so bad.

872
00:30:50.225 --> 00:30:52.143
This bitch left
my goddamn body out.

873
00:30:52.185 --> 00:30:54.145
He drew my face and my neck

874
00:30:54.187 --> 00:30:56.189
and then put a boot
underneath it.

875
00:30:56.231 --> 00:30:58.233
Look--look--look at this.

876
00:30:58.274 --> 00:31:00.068
Where the fuck is my body at.
Crazy Horse?

877
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.445
He said.
"You live in the boot."

878
00:31:02.487 --> 00:31:03.613
He took off.

879
00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:05.865
I couldn't catch him.

880
00:31:05.907 --> 00:31:07.117
Son of a bitch.

881
00:31:08.743 --> 00:31:10.245
I'm trying to do things
that actually

882
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:12.622
work on my levels of patience.

883
00:31:12.664 --> 00:31:14.916
I'm trying to do things
that allow me

884
00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:16.918
time to think for me. right.

885
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.670
like stepping away
from the pack.

886
00:31:18.712 --> 00:31:19.963
giving myself some me time.

887
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:21.423
I recommend you guys
do it too. right?

888
00:31:21.464 --> 00:31:23.091
Step away from the pack
every once in a while.

889
00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:25.552
Go do some shit for you.
an activity for you.

890
00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:27.137
It's a good stress reliever.
It is.

891
00:31:27.178 --> 00:31:28.471
It really is.

892
00:31:29.723 --> 00:31:30.807
One thing I used to do.
I used to play

893
00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:32.225
a lot of basketball. right?

894
00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:34.769
I would go up to gyms
and just do open runs.

895
00:31:34.811 --> 00:31:36.271
I had to stop going to one gym

896
00:31:36.312 --> 00:31:38.523
because they turned it
into a picture fest.

897
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:39.941
Everybody wanted
to take fucking pictures.

898
00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:41.067
I ain't here to take pictures.

899
00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:42.193
I'm here to play ball.

900
00:31:42.235 --> 00:31:43.945
I'm not coming back
to this gym.

901
00:31:43.987 --> 00:31:45.572
I'll go find another gym.
where they do

902
00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:47.741
three-on-three basketball
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

903
00:31:47.782 --> 00:31:48.992
6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

904
00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:50.577
It's much better.
This where I need to be.

905
00:31:50.618 --> 00:31:51.703
It's more intimate.

906
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:52.746
Keep in mind.
when I play basketball.

907
00:31:52.787 --> 00:31:54.039
I talk a lot of shit.

908
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.623
Fuck outta here. bitch. ah.

909
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:58.418
You're too small.

910
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.128
I'll put you in my back pocket.
with your little ass.

911
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.212
You're too fucking small.

912
00:32:01.254 --> 00:32:03.006
Put you
right in my back pocket.

913
00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:04.049
I'm about to get buckets.

914
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.133
It's time to eat.

915
00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:06.968
Mmm. mmm. mmm.

916
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.263
Keep in mind. when I talk shit.
I don't like it

917
00:32:10.305 --> 00:32:11.639
when you don't talk shit back.

918
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:13.266
You messing up the competitive
nature in the game.

919
00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:15.393
If I talk shit. talk shit back.

920
00:32:15.435 --> 00:32:16.686
We playing three-on-three
basketball.

921
00:32:16.728 --> 00:32:18.313
They treating it like
it's the goddamn NBA.

922
00:32:18.355 --> 00:32:20.648
Calling plays.
setting picks and shit.

923
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.108
It was too much.
We lost.

924
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.236
I quit.
I'm not playing anymore.

925
00:32:25.278 --> 00:32:26.905
I walked out.
There was a sign in the lobby.

926
00:32:26.946 --> 00:32:28.740
The sign in the lobby said.
"Deaf run

927
00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:31.117
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m."

928
00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:32.786
Yeah. they were deaf.

929
00:32:32.827 --> 00:32:33.787
They didn't hear shit I said.

930
00:32:33.828 --> 00:32:35.663
Now--no. they didn't.

931
00:32:35.705 --> 00:32:37.540
They weren't calling plays.

932
00:32:37.582 --> 00:32:38.541
They were communicating.

933
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:39.709
They were talking
to one another.

934
00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:42.045
Now. this isn't a joke
about deaf people.

935
00:32:42.087 --> 00:32:43.171
That's not what
the joke is about.

936
00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:44.464
It's about what I looked like.

937
00:32:44.506 --> 00:32:47.300
What the fuck did I
look like back there?

938
00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:48.426
'Cause I know
what I was saying.

939
00:32:48.468 --> 00:32:51.304
I'm talking shit.
"Yeah. bitch.

940
00:32:52.514 --> 00:32:54.641
"Yeah. bitch.
Yeah. You're too small.

941
00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:56.893
"Put you in my fucking back
pocket. with your little ass.

942
00:32:56.935 --> 00:32:58.061
"Yeah.
Come on. bitch.

943
00:32:59.604 --> 00:33:01.147
"I'm about to get buckets
of barbecue chicken.

944
00:33:01.189 --> 00:33:03.400
Mmm. mmm. mmm."
That's what I said.

945
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.320
What does that look like
without the volume. hmm?

946
00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:09.531
What does it look like
without the volume?

947
00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:36.307
I just told that man
that I want to eat his ass.

948
00:33:36.349 --> 00:33:38.351
That's what I just said.

949
00:33:38.393 --> 00:33:39.436
I don't want to eat your ass.

950
00:33:39.477 --> 00:33:41.271
That's barbecue chicken. bitch.

951
00:33:41.312 --> 00:33:42.480
Barbecue chicken.

952
00:33:42.522 --> 00:33:44.274
I'm not trying to eat your ass.

953
00:33:46.234 --> 00:33:48.236
Had to leave a note.
apologize.

954
00:33:50.238 --> 00:33:52.449
I am working on my shit. man.

955
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.200
Certain things I just can't do
anymore. not like I used to.

956
00:33:54.242 --> 00:33:55.368
I stopped drinking.

957
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.911
I don't drink
as much as I used to.

958
00:33:56.953 --> 00:33:58.246
Not because I had a problem.
just 'cause I'm getting older.

959
00:33:58.288 --> 00:33:59.497
I still drink.

960
00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:00.623
I love to drink.

961
00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:02.000
I have a fucking tequila.
Gran Coramino.

962
00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:04.377
You guys should know
that I love to fucking drink.

963
00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:06.004
That Mino Lino.
You need it in your life.

964
00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:07.213
Trust me.

965
00:34:07.255 --> 00:34:08.631
I just can't drink
the way I used to.

966
00:34:08.673 --> 00:34:11.676
When I was 22. 23 years old.
I'd take shots for days.

967
00:34:11.718 --> 00:34:13.345
Bow. bow. bow.

968
00:34:13.386 --> 00:34:15.430
Dance afterwards.
Yeah. bitch. uh.

969
00:34:17.057 --> 00:34:19.726
43 is different.

970
00:34:19.768 --> 00:34:21.353
It's different at 43.

971
00:34:21.394 --> 00:34:23.438
One shot.
Bow.

972
00:34:26.941 --> 00:34:30.570
Some--

973
00:34:30.612 --> 00:34:32.739
somebody put something
in my drink.

974
00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:37.577
Somebody trying to do something
to me here tonight.

975
00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:40.080
I'm a blackout drunk too.

976
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:41.414
I'll black out.

977
00:34:41.456 --> 00:34:43.583
In a heartbeat.
I'll black the fuck out.

978
00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:45.418
Mid-conversation.

979
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.462
What we doing?
We going--we going club--

980
00:34:47.504 --> 00:34:49.547
hey. we go--everybody--
everybody go club--we all--

981
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:50.799
[mimicking snoring]
I'm out.

982
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.385
It's a wrap.

983
00:34:53.426 --> 00:34:54.928
I don't like my friends.

984
00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:57.472
These son of a bitches never
take me home when I black out.

985
00:34:57.514 --> 00:35:01.351
They just prop me up in the
corner. keep the party going.

986
00:35:01.393 --> 00:35:03.144
'Cause they need my face
to get into places.

987
00:35:03.186 --> 00:35:05.605
They need my fucking face.

988
00:35:05.647 --> 00:35:07.565
They treat me like Bernie
from "Weekend at Bernie's."

989
00:35:07.607 --> 00:35:11.152
They just keep showing
my face at the door.

990
00:35:13.988 --> 00:35:14.948
Get in there. Kev.

991
00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:15.949
Bitch. I'm dead.

992
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.701
Check my pulse.

993
00:35:20.995 --> 00:35:22.580
My friends are hilarious. man.

994
00:35:22.622 --> 00:35:24.791
I recently had to have
a conversation with my friends.

995
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:26.084
Had a big conversation
with them.

996
00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:27.377
Had to explain to my friends
that I'm no longer

997
00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:28.795
the friend of old.

998
00:35:28.837 --> 00:35:31.172
I'm no longer the all-for-one.
one-for-all friend.

999
00:35:31.214 --> 00:35:32.924
I'm no longer the "we ride
together. we die together."

1000
00:35:32.966 --> 00:35:35.552
I'm no longer the "if one
go down. we all go down."

1001
00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:37.804
I'm no longer that friend.

1002
00:35:37.846 --> 00:35:39.514
43 years old.
I'm at a point in my life

1003
00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:42.267
where I'm not choosing to deal
with the world of bullshit

1004
00:35:42.308 --> 00:35:43.351
that comes with my friends.

1005
00:35:43.393 --> 00:35:45.020
I no longer want your bullshit.

1006
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:46.312
I'm not embracing it anymore.

1007
00:35:46.354 --> 00:35:47.605
I'm at a point in my life--

1008
00:35:47.647 --> 00:35:50.066
I'm very serious.
very serious.

1009
00:35:50.108 --> 00:35:52.444
I'm at a point in my life
where I'll tell on you.

1010
00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:54.154
I'll fucking tell.
I told them.

1011
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:55.613
That's where I'm at.

1012
00:35:55.655 --> 00:35:57.365
You do something
around me that involves the law

1013
00:35:57.407 --> 00:35:59.701
in any way. shape. or form.
I'll fucking tell.

1014
00:35:59.743 --> 00:36:00.910
I'll tell.

1015
00:36:00.952 --> 00:36:03.329
It doesn't make me
a snitch or a bitch.

1016
00:36:03.371 --> 00:36:04.873
You know why?
You know why?

1017
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:07.375
'Cause I'm telling you ahead
of time what the fuck I'll do.

1018
00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:08.835
That means I'm giving you
an opportunity

1019
00:36:08.877 --> 00:36:10.337
to make better decisions
around me

1020
00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:11.629
so that I don't have
to tell on you.

1021
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:14.341
I don't want to have
to fucking tell on you.

1022
00:36:14.382 --> 00:36:15.633
They thought I was lying.

1023
00:36:15.675 --> 00:36:17.135
I wasn't.

1024
00:36:17.177 --> 00:36:18.511
We went to Mexico.

1025
00:36:18.553 --> 00:36:20.680
Keep in mind. we fly private.
right?

1026
00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:21.931
We go to Mexico.

1027
00:36:21.973 --> 00:36:23.183
We're on the plane.

1028
00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:24.517
While we're on the plane.
my friends.

1029
00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:26.770
they love to bring weed.
love the flower weed.

1030
00:36:26.811 --> 00:36:27.812
Go right ahead.

1031
00:36:27.854 --> 00:36:28.938
Bring all the fucking weed
you want.

1032
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.232
It's all fun and games
until it's not.

1033
00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:33.902
I said. I don't
want to hear shit

1034
00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:36.196
when we land and them little
Mexican dogs get active.

1035
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:38.073
start sniffing your bags.

1036
00:36:38.114 --> 00:36:39.699
I don't want to see you
looking up like you

1037
00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:41.034
don't know what the fuck
they smell.

1038
00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:42.202
'cause guess what I'ma do.

1039
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:43.328

That dog found it. Officer.

1045
00:36:50.627 --> 00:36:52.879
That dog got it right there.

00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.423
Mark. raise your hand

1047
00:36:55.465 --> 00:36:57.217

00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:07.394
I'll never forget it.

1052
00:37:07.435 --> 00:37:09.145
We're on the plane
going to Mexico.

1053
00:37:09.187 --> 00:37:12.023
First of all. it's always
the person with the drugs

1054
00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:13.900
that's got the worst ideas
in the world.

1055
00:37:13.942 --> 00:37:15.151
Always.

1056
00:37:15.193 --> 00:37:16.945
That's Joey's stupid ass.

1057
00:37:16.986 --> 00:37:18.947
Keep using the word "we."

1058
00:37:18.988 --> 00:37:20.156
"This what we gonna do.

1059
00:37:20.198 --> 00:37:22.075
"This how we gonna
make it work.

1060
00:37:22.117 --> 00:37:23.576
"When we get off
the plane. look.

1061
00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:25.245
"If they want to go through
your bags. all you gotta do

1062
00:37:25.286 --> 00:37:26.663
"is grab the bag
without the drugs.

1063
00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:28.415
"If they don't. then grab
the bag with the drugs.

1064
00:37:28.456 --> 00:37:29.582
"That's how we get
the drugs through.

1065
00:37:29.624 --> 00:37:31.167
We alternate it like that."

1066
00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:33.336
Everybody on the plane
was like. "Bet. dope. yeah.

1067
00:37:33.378 --> 00:37:34.921
Let's do it."

1068
00:37:34.963 --> 00:37:37.590
I said. "That don't work for
me. I don't like that plan.

1069
00:37:37.632 --> 00:37:39.092
"I don't fucking like it.
My name on my bag.

1070
00:37:39.134 --> 00:37:40.135
"Don't touch my bag.

1071
00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:41.177
"You touch my bag. I'll tell.

1072
00:37:41.219 --> 00:37:42.387
I'll fucking tell."

1073
00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:45.598
I'll never forget it.
This a true story.

1074
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.517
We're landing in Mexico.
Plane go down.

1075
00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:50.061
[mimicking tires screeching]

1076
00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:51.980
I look out the window. looked
like an episode of "Narcos."

1077
00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:54.941
I've never seen more Mexican
officers in my goddamn life.

1078
00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:56.693
They standing there.
They got the dogs.

1079
00:37:56.735 --> 00:38:01.072
I've never seen dogs look
through the window of a plane.

1080
00:38:01.114 --> 00:38:03.616
The dogs.

1081
00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:05.410
When I saw that.
When I saw the dogs.

1082
00:38:05.452 --> 00:38:08.204
I said. "Oh. boy.
[laughs]

1083
00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:12.042
"Y'all going to jail.
Y'all going to fucking jail.

1084
00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:14.794
They smell it.
The dogs smell it already."

1085
00:38:16.379 --> 00:38:19.424
Little Mexican man comes on the
plane after the door go down.

1086
00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:20.884
He starts speaking Spanish.

1087
00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:22.594
Keep in mind.
I don't know Spanish.

1088
00:38:22.635 --> 00:38:24.721
I know a couple words.
and I know the rhythm.

1089
00:38:24.763 --> 00:38:26.890
I know the rhythm of Spanish.

1090
00:38:26.931 --> 00:38:30.060
For the purpose of this joke.
I'ma hit you with the rhythm.

1091
00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:31.895
The reason why is because
I want you to feel like

1092
00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:32.771
you were there.

1093
00:38:32.812 --> 00:38:35.357
I'm telling you ahead of time

1094
00:38:35.398 --> 00:38:38.485
these are not real words. OK?

1095
00:38:38.526 --> 00:38:39.861
They're not real words.

1096
00:38:39.903 --> 00:38:43.073
It's gonna sound like it.
but it's just a rhythm.

1097
00:38:43.114 --> 00:38:44.324
But don't make me laugh.

1098
00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:45.492
'cause I gotta stay
in the character.

1099
00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:47.118
Don't make me fucking laugh.

1100
00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:53.541
So he started off--

1101
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:55.377
he started off calm
and then escalated.

1102
00:38:55.418 --> 00:38:57.462
This is exactly
what he did. OK?

1103
00:39:08.264 --> 00:39:11.142
Dónde. hmm?

1104
00:39:11.184 --> 00:39:13.103
Hmm?

1105
00:39:13.144 --> 00:39:16.231
Dónde--dónde--dónde está?

1106
00:39:16.272 --> 00:39:17.941
[sniffs]
Hmm?

1107
00:39:20.193 --> 00:39:23.071
[mimicking Spanish]

1108
00:39:38.795 --> 00:39:39.963
He looking right at me.

1109
00:39:40.005 --> 00:39:41.047
He looking me dead

00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:43.341
He go. "Qué?

1111

Qué?"

1112
00:39:45.176 --> 00:39:47.554
I don't know what the fuck
"qué" mean.

1113
00:39:47.595 --> 00:39:48.722
but he want an answer.

1114
00:39:48.763 --> 00:39:49.889
He looking right at me.
I panicked.

1115
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:51.433
I didn't know
what to fucking do.

1116
00:39:51.474 --> 00:39:53.018
I panicked.
I said. "Queso."

1117
00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:56.855
I just said it.
I said. "Queso."

1118
00:39:56.896 --> 00:39:58.857
I thought about the cheese.

1119
00:39:58.898 --> 00:40:01.067
I don't know what the fuck.

1120
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:02.610
"Queso."

1121
00:40:03.945 --> 00:40:05.613
He thought I was being
a smart-ass.

1122
00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:07.866
He said. "Oh."

1123
00:40:10.285 --> 00:40:13.079
"Queso. ah.

1124
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.289
Hmm."

[mimicking Spanish]

1126
00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:18.793
You ever hear Spanish people
talk real fast

1127
00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:22.047
and it just sound like
a bunch of clicks?

1128
00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:23.131

We get off the plane.

1138
00:40:55.455 --> 00:40:56.539
They got a security booth

1139
00:40:56.581 --> 00:40:58.124
You gotta get in the booth

I almost said.
"They got drugs."

1165

I swear to God.

1166
00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:10.572
I was fucking nervous.
My stomach was bubbling.

1167
00:42:10.613 --> 00:42:13.241
My ass was wet.
I was farting.

1168
00:42:13.283 --> 00:42:14.242
It was too much.

1169

00:42:36.723 --> 00:42:37.766
Let me tell you
how childish I am.

1177
00:42:37.807 --> 00:42:39.601
When it stopped
on green. I went.

1178
00:42:39.642 --> 00:42:41.478
I grabbed my bag.
I didn't look at nobody.

1179
00:42:41.519 --> 00:42:44.522
I just walked off the tarmac.

1180
00:42:44.564 --> 00:42:47.150
I walked the fuck
off the tarmac.

1181
00:42:47.192 --> 00:42:48.902
I saved myself.

1182
00:42:49.944 --> 00:42:51.321
I could hear my friends.

1183
00:42:51.363 --> 00:42:53.365
They was like. "Kev.

00:43:19.516 --> 00:43:22.310
That's what I did.
I went to the fucking resort.

1195
00:43:22.352 --> 00:43:25.105
I was at that bitch
for two hours by myself.

1196
00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.606
At that point. I just figured.

1197
00:43:26.648 --> 00:43:27.816
You know. I guess
it is what it is.

1198
00:43:27.857 --> 00:43:30.276
I don't know.

1199
00:43:30.318 --> 00:43:32.570
They all got there in. like.

Here's why I gotta

'cause I'm the first one.

1206

and everybody's relaxed.

1207

00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:54.801
"Let me get a little bit
of that weed.

1214
00:43:54.843 --> 00:43:56.177
Where the weed at?"

1215
00:43:57.887 --> 00:44:01.474
"We did it!

1216
00:44:01.516 --> 00:44:04.102
"We made it through. man.

1217
00:44:04.144 --> 00:44:07.522
Teamwork made
the dream work. baby."

1218
00:44:07.564 --> 00:44:08.690
"Shut the fuck up. Kev."

1219
00:44:08.732 --> 00:44:10.233
"All right. I understand."

1220
00:44:12.027 --> 00:44:14.279
My friends are special.

1221
00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.781
I got a good group. man.
I got a real good group.

1222
00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:18.116
I do.

1223
00:44:18.158 --> 00:44:19.284
Every time that they have had
to be there.

1224
00:44:19.325 --> 00:44:20.535
they've been there.

1225
00:44:20.577 --> 00:44:21.661
My friends have never
not been there for me.

1226
00:44:21.703 --> 00:44:22.871
There's only one time

1227
00:44:22.912 --> 00:44:24.414
where they had to. like.
reel me back.

1228
00:44:24.456 --> 00:44:26.833
where I was in too deep
and they had to. like. grab me

1229
00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:28.585
and make me get ahold
of myself.

1230
00:44:28.626 --> 00:44:32.005
This is when social media
in the beginning stages. like.

1231
00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:33.381
was getting out of hand
a little bit.

1232
00:44:33.423 --> 00:44:35.383
when the live feature
had first started.

1233
00:44:35.425 --> 00:44:36.968
You can go live.

1234
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.136
You can click
on somebody's live.

1235
00:44:38.178 --> 00:44:40.305
The whole world
can watch your live.

1236
00:44:40.347 --> 00:44:41.598
Gotta remember.
I got a lot of followers

1237
00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:42.640
on social media.

1238
00:44:42.682 --> 00:44:43.850
200-some million people.

1239
00:44:43.892 --> 00:44:45.143
That shit can go to your head.

1240
00:44:45.185 --> 00:44:46.603
I was treating it
like a fucking weapon.

1241
00:44:46.644 --> 00:44:49.356
I wish you would tell me
you couldn't do something.

1242
00:44:49.397 --> 00:44:50.607
I was snapping.

1243
00:44:50.648 --> 00:44:52.984
showing up in restaurants
with no reservation.

1244
00:44:53.026 --> 00:44:55.236
Kevin Hart.
I need a table for 25.

1245
00:44:55.278 --> 00:44:56.404
Did you call?

1246
00:44:56.446 --> 00:44:57.781
Bitch. you want me
to go live right now?

1247
00:44:57.822 --> 00:45:00.158
Shut this whole
fucking place down.

1248
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.326
Kev. chill.
Shut up. bitch.

1249
00:45:01.368 --> 00:45:02.369
before I go live on you.

1250
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.411
Everybody back up.

1251
00:45:03.453 --> 00:45:04.371
Back the fuck up right now.

1252
00:45:04.412 --> 00:45:05.622
Get back.

1253
00:45:05.663 --> 00:45:07.957
Everybody get the fuck back
before I go live.

1254
00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:10.460
I lost my mind.

1255
00:45:10.502 --> 00:45:12.837
What it was is. social media
was getting so negative.

1256
00:45:12.879 --> 00:45:14.756
It was way too negative.

1257
00:45:14.798 --> 00:45:17.467
I was consuming
too much negativity.

1258
00:45:17.509 --> 00:45:19.052
I'ma tell you the video
that really made me back off

1259
00:45:19.094 --> 00:45:20.720
social media.
made me put it down.

1260
00:45:20.762 --> 00:45:22.555
When you guys leave. I want you
to Google this as well.

1261
00:45:22.597 --> 00:45:24.891
This is Googleable as well.

1262
00:45:24.933 --> 00:45:26.810
It's a video
of a barista arguing

1263
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:28.228
with a woman in a coffee shop.

1264
00:45:28.269 --> 00:45:29.396
She's arguing with the woman
'cause the woman's

1265
00:45:29.437 --> 00:45:30.438
not wearing a mask.

1266
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.523
Woman without a mask goes.

1267
00:45:31.564 --> 00:45:32.816
"Can I get a little cup
of coffee?"

1268
00:45:32.857 --> 00:45:33.775
Says. "I can't serve you
'cause you're not

1269
00:45:33.817 --> 00:45:34.984
wearing a mask."

1270
00:45:35.026 --> 00:45:36.027
She says.
"I just want a little cup."

1271
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:37.445
"Don't matter what you want.

1272
00:45:37.487 --> 00:45:38.780
You're not wearing a mask.
I can't give you nothing."

1273
00:45:38.822 --> 00:45:39.906
She said. "Come on.
don't be a bitch."

1274
00:45:39.948 --> 00:45:41.199
"Don't call me a bitch."

1275
00:45:41.241 --> 00:45:42.659
"Well. you being a bitch."
"Fuck you. bitch."

1276
00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:44.035
"Fuck you. bitch."
"Dumb bitch."

1277
00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:45.745
"Stupid bitch."
"Ho bitch."

1278
00:45:45.787 --> 00:45:46.913
"Slut bitch."

1279
00:45:46.955 --> 00:45:48.456
Out of nowhere.
the woman without a mask

1280
00:45:48.498 --> 00:45:50.125
pulls her pants down.
takes a shit.

1281
00:45:50.166 --> 00:45:52.752
starts throwing it
behind the person.

1282
00:45:52.794 --> 00:45:54.254
Yeah. Don't believe me?
Google it.

1283
00:45:54.295 --> 00:45:57.257
Google it
when you fucking leave.

1284
00:45:57.298 --> 00:45:58.967
Now. your reaction
is different from mine.

1285
00:45:59.009 --> 00:46:00.510
I was blown away.

1286
00:46:00.552 --> 00:46:03.054
I was blown away
by this woman's ability

1287
00:46:03.096 --> 00:46:04.973
to shit on command.

1288
00:46:05.015 --> 00:46:07.267
I've never seen
anything like it.

1289
00:46:07.308 --> 00:46:09.978
She didn't shit on the floor
and pick it up and throw it.

1290
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.438
These were individual nuggets.

1291
00:46:11.479 --> 00:46:12.814
Bow!

1292
00:46:13.732 --> 00:46:14.983
Bow!

1293
00:46:15.775 --> 00:46:17.152
Bow!

1294
00:46:17.193 --> 00:46:18.236
Three.

1295
00:46:18.278 --> 00:46:20.447
Three solid rockets
out of the ass.

1296
00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:23.283
You gotta watch
the fucking video.

1297
00:46:23.324 --> 00:46:25.910
In the middle of the video.
a Black girl just run by.

1298
00:46:25.952 --> 00:46:27.954
"They throwing shit in here."

1299
00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:30.874
You can hear her.

1300
00:46:30.915 --> 00:46:34.044
"They don't pay me enough
for this shit."

1301
00:46:34.085 --> 00:46:36.004
You gotta watch
the fucking video.

1302
00:46:37.547 --> 00:46:39.883
Shit that really made me laugh
is the guy taping it.

1303
00:46:39.924 --> 00:46:41.301
'cause he in the corner.

1304
00:46:41.343 --> 00:46:43.345
You can't see him.
This is what he says.

1305
00:46:43.386 --> 00:46:46.931
He goes. "This the best angle
I could get. y'all."

1306
00:46:49.476 --> 00:46:53.063
Who asked
for this footage. sir?

1307
00:46:53.104 --> 00:46:55.815
They're throwing shit in there.

1308
00:46:55.857 --> 00:46:57.233
I don't know about y'all.
but if I get hit

1309
00:46:57.275 --> 00:46:59.903
with a piece of shit.
my life is over.

1310
00:46:59.944 --> 00:47:01.863
It's over for me.

1311
00:47:01.905 --> 00:47:04.199
A piece of human shit

1312
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.535
to the temple at 7:00 a.m.?

1313
00:47:07.577 --> 00:47:10.246
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

1314
00:47:10.288 --> 00:47:12.165
Put your dick in my grits.

1315
00:47:12.207 --> 00:47:16.169
I'll take dick in grits
all day.

1316
00:47:16.211 --> 00:47:21.049
Slam your dick in my grits.
Mr. Dick Slammer.

1317
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:22.926
I don't want to get hit
with a piece of shit

1318
00:47:22.967 --> 00:47:25.345
in the goddamn temple.

1319
00:47:25.387 --> 00:47:28.348
You're never gonna
live that down.

1320
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.685
7:00 a.m.. you in the best mood
of your fucking life.

1321
00:47:31.726 --> 00:47:33.061
Good morning.

00:47:33.103 --> 00:47:34.562
How y'all doing?

1323
00:47:34.604 --> 00:47:36.314
Hey. Carl. let me get
two vanilla lattes

1324
00:47:36.356 --> 00:47:38.566
and two extra pumps of syrup.

1325
00:47:38.608 --> 00:47:40.026
Yeah.

1326
00:47:40.068 --> 00:47:41.695
You too. man.
I know that's right.

1327
00:47:41.736 --> 00:47:43.863
Yeah.

1328
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.448
The fuck just happened?

1329
00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:49.619
The fuck just happened in here?

1330
00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.084
Something just hit me
in the fucking head.

1331
00:47:56.126 --> 00:47:58.211
What the fuck?

1332
00:47:58.253 --> 00:47:59.379
What the fuck is this?

1333
00:47:59.421 --> 00:48:01.464
What the fuck
is going on with this?

1334
00:48:01.506 --> 00:48:02.507
Now. hold on. now.

1335
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:04.384
Now. hold on.

1336
00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:06.511
This better not be what
the fuck I think it is.

1337
00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:10.807
This is shit.

1338
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:13.852
Somebody just hit me
with a piece of shit.

1339
00:48:13.893 --> 00:48:15.770
You gotta ask the question
you thought you would never

1340
00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:17.939
ask in your goddamn life.

1341
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:22.277
Who just threw
that piece of shit at me?

1342
00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:24.571
I want to see everybody hands.

1343
00:48:24.612 --> 00:48:27.741
If I see shit on anybody hands.
I swear to God.

1344
00:48:27.782 --> 00:48:29.909
"Hey. I got grits on my dick.

1345
00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:32.996
"That's as far as I go.

1346
00:48:33.038 --> 00:48:35.248
I ain't that nasty.
That's nasty. now."

1347
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.541
"Throwing shit is disgusting.

1348
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:38.168
"I'll put my dick
in grits all day.

1349
00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:40.462
That's where I draw the line."

1350
00:48:41.796 --> 00:48:43.089
Social media.

1351
00:48:43.131 --> 00:48:45.008
Social media had me fucked up.

1352
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.426
Social media had me believing

1353
00:48:46.468 --> 00:48:49.346
that I was an activist
for one day.

1354
00:48:49.387 --> 00:48:51.598
For one day I. got caught up.

1355
00:48:51.639 --> 00:48:53.224
I got caught up bad. man.

1356
00:48:53.266 --> 00:48:55.101

00:50:03.878 --> 00:50:05.088
"We saw your tweets.

1387
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.339
"Listen. first of all.
we're with you.

1388
00:50:06.381 --> 00:50:07.757
"OK?
We're your partners.

1389
00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:09.467
We're here for you.
We got your back."

1390
00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:10.760
By the way. they're talking
to me like this

1391
00:50:10.802 --> 00:50:12.303
because they believe
that I'm an activist.

1392
00:50:12.345 --> 00:50:13.847
Once again.
I'm not an activist.

1393
00:50:13.888 --> 00:50:15.140
I'm just caught up in the shit.

1394
00:50:15.181 --> 00:50:16.933
When you start the shit.
you can't stop the shit

1395
00:50:16.975 --> 00:50:18.018
till you finish the shit.

1396
00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:19.811
I'm in the shit.

1397
00:50:19.853 --> 00:50:21.062
They said. "Kev. listen.

1398
00:50:21.104 --> 00:50:22.272
"You want to take
the company plane.

1399
00:50:22.313 --> 00:50:23.773
"go down there
to the memorial service?

1400
00:50:23.815 --> 00:50:25.233
"You want to take
your friends. family?

1401
00:50:25.275 --> 00:50:27.193
"You can. all right?
We'll send some partners.

1402
00:50:27.235 --> 00:50:28.361
"We'll make it
a teachable moment.

1403
00:50:28.403 --> 00:50:29.612
"All you gotta do
is say the word.

1404
00:50:29.654 --> 00:50:31.197
"Do you want the plane?
Say the word. Kev.

1405
00:50:31.239 --> 00:50:33.158
It's yours.
Do you want the plane?"

1406
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:41.249
Fuck yeah. I want the plane.

1407
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.209
They gave me the goddamn plane.

1408
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:44.294
This is big.

1409
00:50:44.336 --> 00:50:45.628
I show up at the plane.

1410
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.547
By the way. I didn't know
what to bring.

1411
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:49.591
I didn't pack any bags.
This is my first activist trip.

1412
00:50:49.632 --> 00:50:51.718
I just showed up.

1413
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.386
When I get there.
the first two people I see

1414
00:50:53.428 --> 00:50:55.764
is Tyrese and Ludacris. right?

1415
00:50:55.805 --> 00:50:57.223
First two people.
Yeah.

1416
00:50:57.265 --> 00:50:58.683
When I saw them. I knew.

1417
00:50:58.725 --> 00:51:00.143
I knew off the bat that this
was a fucking mistake.

1418
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:01.686
"I want to go home."

1419
00:51:01.728 --> 00:51:02.812
I said that.

1420
00:51:02.854 --> 00:51:05.357
I want to go home.
It don't look right.

1421
00:51:05.398 --> 00:51:07.192
Why the fuck they send
the cast of "Fast & Furious"

1422
00:51:07.233 --> 00:51:08.193
out this bitch?

1423
00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:10.111
It don't look right.

1424
00:51:12.113 --> 00:51:13.239
I get on the goddamn plane.

1425
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:14.574
T.I. come out the bathroom.

1426
00:51:14.616 --> 00:51:15.575
He looked at me.

1427
00:51:15.617 --> 00:51:16.701
He said. "Kev.
you think they got

1428
00:51:16.743 --> 00:51:17.994
metal detectors
where we're going?"

1429
00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:19.621
I said. "Why the fuck
would you ask me that?"

1430
00:51:19.662 --> 00:51:20.872
He said. "'Cause I want to know
if I should bring my bag."

1431
00:51:20.914 --> 00:51:22.332
I said. "What's in your bag?

1432
00:51:22.374 --> 00:51:24.751
"And before you tell me.
you should know that I'll tell.

1433
00:51:24.793 --> 00:51:27.420
"I'll fucking tell.

1434
00:51:27.462 --> 00:51:29.839
Ain't got time to deal
with your shit. Tip."

1435
00:51:31.424 --> 00:51:32.550
We on the plane.
they want to talk.

1436
00:51:32.592 --> 00:51:34.344
I don't want to talk.
I had a long day.

1437
00:51:34.386 --> 00:51:35.762
I'm going to sleep.

1438
00:51:35.804 --> 00:51:37.722
I wake up. nobody's dressed
the way they were

1439
00:51:37.764 --> 00:51:39.474
when I got
on the goddamn plane.

1440
00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:41.267
Everybody's got on
activist wear.

1441
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:42.352
They're wearing all black.

1442
00:51:42.394 --> 00:51:44.145
By the way. nobody told me.

1443
00:51:44.187 --> 00:51:48.608
I got a goddamn salmon-colored
V-neck on and some khakis.

1444
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.318
Looking like Carlton
in his prime.

1445
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.486
Nobody told me.

1446
00:51:53.321 --> 00:51:55.740
Tyrese got on the black beret.
black sunglasses.

1447
00:51:55.782 --> 00:51:57.784
black turtleneck.
black leather trench coat.

1448
00:51:57.826 --> 00:52:00.120
these black cargo pants.
and these combat boots

1449
00:52:00.161 --> 00:52:01.371
that came above his knee.

1450
00:52:01.413 --> 00:52:02.956
He looked like a male
Mary J. Blige.

1451
00:52:02.997 --> 00:52:06.710
I've never seen anything
like it in my fucking life.

1452
00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:09.713
I've never seen
nothing like it.

1453
00:52:09.754 --> 00:52:11.339
Luda had his Afro picked out.

1454
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:13.299
Tip got a fucking jumpsuit on.

1455
00:52:13.341 --> 00:52:15.677
It's ridiculous.

1456
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:16.594
We get in an SUV.

1457
00:52:16.636 --> 00:52:17.679
We go to the memorial service.

1458
00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:19.514
When we pull up.
they outside protesting.

1459
00:52:19.556 --> 00:52:20.932
Black people all in the street.

1460
00:52:20.974 --> 00:52:22.684
Cops lined up
down the side of the street

1461
00:52:22.726 --> 00:52:24.060
with riot gear on.

1462
00:52:24.102 --> 00:52:26.646
Black man in the middle
with a bullhorn going off.

1463
00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:28.481
Black Lives Matter. and if you
don't think they matter.

1464
00:52:28.523 --> 00:52:29.607
then you're part
of the problem.

1465
00:52:29.649 --> 00:52:30.984
And today we find a solution.

1466
00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:32.402
The solution is death.

1467
00:52:32.444 --> 00:52:34.112
Every Black person
that showed up here today

1468
00:52:34.154 --> 00:52:35.155
is willing to die.

1469
00:52:35.196 --> 00:52:37.282
We will all die today.

1470
00:52:37.323 --> 00:52:38.742
We don't give a fuck
about life.

1471
00:52:38.783 --> 00:52:40.827
If you Black and you here.
it's 'cause you came to die.

1472
00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:43.329
If you Black and you
in this circle around me.

1473
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:44.998
it's 'cause you ready
to die first.

1474
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.332
I look down.

1475
00:52:46.374 --> 00:52:47.876
I'm in the fucking circle.

1476
00:52:47.917 --> 00:52:50.545
I said. "Wait a minute.

1477
00:52:50.587 --> 00:52:52.088
"That's not why I came.
I didn't come for that.

1478
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.215
"That's not why I'm here.

1479
00:52:54.257 --> 00:52:55.884
"Once again. I don't think
y'all have my email address.

1480
00:52:55.925 --> 00:52:57.135
"'cause I'm not getting
these messages.

1481
00:52:57.177 --> 00:52:58.511
I'm not getting
these messages."

1482
00:52:58.553 --> 00:53:00.513
But I don't want to stop
what they got going on.

1483
00:53:00.555 --> 00:53:01.806
so I try to back out
the circle

1484
00:53:01.848 --> 00:53:03.767
without drawing attention
to myself.

1485
00:53:03.808 --> 00:53:04.642
He see me.

1486
00:53:04.684 --> 00:53:06.019
He go. "Oh. shit. Kev Hart."

1487
00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:07.687
"I see you. Black king.

1488
00:53:07.729 --> 00:53:09.356
"Way to come out here
and be with your people.

1489
00:53:09.397 --> 00:53:10.565
Say something to your people."

1490
00:53:10.607 --> 00:53:11.858
He throw me the bullhorn.

1491
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.360
[grunts]

1492
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:16.321
I catch it.

1493
00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:18.281
Now I gotta give a speech.

1494
00:53:18.323 --> 00:53:19.449
I've never given
an activist speech.

1495
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:21.034
I don't know what the fuck
to say.

1496
00:53:21.076 --> 00:53:22.369
but I cannot say nothing.

1497
00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.537
I have to say something.

1498
00:53:24.579 --> 00:53:27.916
Tyrese stupid ass
standing behind me

1499
00:53:27.957 --> 00:53:29.876
saying lines
from "Fast & Furious"

1500
00:53:29.918 --> 00:53:31.419
in my fucking ear.

1501
00:53:33.713 --> 00:53:36.049
"We family.
and we gonna be family."

1502
00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:37.592
"What?"

1503
00:53:37.634 --> 00:53:39.386
"All we got is family."

1504
00:53:39.427 --> 00:53:41.471
"Get the fuck back. Tyrese!"

1505
00:53:42.597 --> 00:53:44.766
He gonna back up
just like Mary.

1506
00:53:50.563 --> 00:53:52.273
Now I gotta give a speech.

1507
00:53:52.315 --> 00:53:54.359
You ever say something and
while you're saying something.

1508
00:53:54.401 --> 00:53:55.568
you realize you're not
saying nothing

1509
00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:56.736
but you gotta keep trying
to say something

1510
00:53:56.778 --> 00:53:59.030
even though you know
it's nothing?

1511
00:53:59.072 --> 00:54:00.156
That was my fucking speech.

1512
00:54:00.198 --> 00:54:01.282
This is my speech
word-for-word.

1513
00:54:01.324 --> 00:54:02.659
Verbatim. this is my speech.

1514
00:54:05.286 --> 00:54:06.788
A'ight.

1515
00:54:08.623 --> 00:54:11.376
Y'all already know
what it is.

1516
00:54:11.418 --> 00:54:13.378
and what it is
is what it's gonna be.

1517
00:54:15.171 --> 00:54:17.841
'Cause at the end
of the day. hey.

1518
00:54:17.882 --> 00:54:19.009
Come on. now.

1519
00:54:20.927 --> 00:54:23.346
Don't make me sad.

1520
00:54:23.388 --> 00:54:27.767
1 plus 1 gonna be 2 every day.

1521
00:54:27.809 --> 00:54:29.269
I got enemies.

1522
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.104
I got a lot of enemies.

1523
00:54:31.146 --> 00:54:33.815
but if I tell you a duck could
pull a truck. strap it up.

1524
00:54:33.857 --> 00:54:35.608
Shut the fuck up.

1525
00:54:37.318 --> 00:54:38.611
I panicked.

1526
00:54:38.653 --> 00:54:39.946
I ran out of shit to say.

1527
00:54:39.988 --> 00:54:41.322
I panicked.

1528
00:54:44.325 --> 00:54:46.953
T.I. got a gun
in his bag right now.

1529
00:54:50.206 --> 00:54:52.042
He a repeat offender.

1530
00:54:52.083 --> 00:54:54.336
Repeat offender.

1531
00:54:56.796 --> 00:54:58.256
I felt bad.
'cause they locked him up.

1532
00:54:58.298 --> 00:55:00.925
They locked his ass up
right there.

1533
00:55:00.967 --> 00:55:02.510
But at the same time.
I did my job.

1534
00:55:02.552 --> 00:55:04.137
That's one less bad person
on the streets.

1535
00:55:04.179 --> 00:55:06.639
You're welcome.

1536
00:55:06.681 --> 00:55:07.974
I asked God for another chance.

1537
00:55:08.016 --> 00:55:09.309
I said. "God. please
give me another chance

1538
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:11.561
to be an activist.
'cause I did that one wrong."

1539
00:55:11.603 --> 00:55:12.937
God gave me another chance.

1540
00:55:12.979 --> 00:55:14.647
They were doing a peaceful
protest in Beverly Hills.

1541
00:55:14.689 --> 00:55:16.816
Black people were marching.
I'm going.

1542
00:55:16.858 --> 00:55:18.443
I need to be out there
with my fucking people.

1543
00:55:18.485 --> 00:55:20.278
This time. I'ma do it right.

1544
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.655
I brought a glove.
I made a sign.

1545
00:55:22.697 --> 00:55:24.657
Spent all day
making my goddamn sign.

1546
00:55:24.699 --> 00:55:27.160
Put blood. sweat. and tears
into this goddamn sign.

1547
00:55:27.202 --> 00:55:30.205
I wanted people to read my sign
and get an immediate feeling

1548
00:55:30.246 --> 00:55:31.414
attached to emotion.

1549
00:55:31.456 --> 00:55:33.875
I wanted that sign
to have an impact.

1550
00:55:33.917 --> 00:55:35.293
Made that sign.

1551
00:55:35.335 --> 00:55:36.836
I went out there and marched.
held my sign up high.

1552
00:55:36.878 --> 00:55:38.296
I'll never fucking forget it.

1553
00:55:38.338 --> 00:55:39.673
Marching.

1554
00:55:39.714 --> 00:55:41.299
While I'm marching.
I hear this noise.

1555
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:42.676
Psss.

1556
00:55:42.717 --> 00:55:43.843
That's what I heard.

1557
00:55:43.885 --> 00:55:45.637
Psss.

1558
00:55:45.679 --> 00:55:47.180
When I first heard it.
first thing I thought is.

1559
00:55:47.222 --> 00:55:48.348
somebody pissed my dad off.

1560
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:49.349
He giving himself a boost.

1561
00:55:49.391 --> 00:55:51.184
That's my dad. right?

1562
00:55:51.226 --> 00:55:52.394
He about to fuck somebody up.

1563
00:55:52.435 --> 00:55:54.562
20 seconds.
It's going down.

1564
00:55:54.604 --> 00:55:55.980
But then somebody
yelled out. "Oh. my God.

1565
00:55:56.022 --> 00:55:57.232
"They're throwing
tear gas at us.

1566
00:55:57.273 --> 00:55:58.525
Run!"
"What?"

1567
00:55:58.566 --> 00:56:00.402
"They throwing tear gas.
Run!"

1568
00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:01.986
I see it.
[coughing]

1569
00:56:02.028 --> 00:56:03.655
That's real tear gas.
Fuck.

1570
00:56:03.697 --> 00:56:05.240
I'm in it.
I'm in the shit.

1571
00:56:05.281 --> 00:56:06.282
I start running.

1572
00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:07.450
This is real chaos.

1573
00:56:07.492 --> 00:56:08.451
This is not a joke.

1574
00:56:08.493 --> 00:56:10.036
I'm in the middle of it.

1575
00:56:10.078 --> 00:56:11.871
While I'm running.
fucking I'm in there.

1576
00:56:11.913 --> 00:56:13.206
the Black guy
in the front goes.

1577
00:56:13.248 --> 00:56:14.666
"Hey. y'all know the drill.

1578
00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:15.709
We ain't new to this.

1579
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:18.086
Mask up.
Put your goggles on."

1580
00:56:23.758 --> 00:56:24.801
Ain't nobody tell me to bring--

1581
00:56:24.843 --> 00:56:25.885
I don't have
no goddamn goggles.

1582
00:56:25.927 --> 00:56:27.303
Where I'm supposed
to get goggles?

1583
00:56:27.345 --> 00:56:29.389
Once again. I don't think
y'all have my email address.

1584
00:56:29.431 --> 00:56:32.392
I'm not getting these messages.

1585
00:56:32.434 --> 00:56:33.601
While we running.
Black guy next to me

1586
00:56:33.643 --> 00:56:34.644
gets shot with a rubber bullet.

1587
00:56:34.686 --> 00:56:36.479
Bow!
I'm right here.

1588
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:37.772
I see it.
Bow!

1589
00:56:37.814 --> 00:56:41.192
He said. "Fuck!"
[growls]

1590
00:56:41.234 --> 00:56:42.902
He said...[groans]
He looked right at me.

1591
00:56:42.944 --> 00:56:45.405
He said...[groans]
"I hate this part."

1592
00:56:45.447 --> 00:56:49.117
I said. "Excuse me. sir?"

1593
00:56:49.159 --> 00:56:51.411
"This part?

1594
00:56:51.453 --> 00:56:54.414
Well. how many parts
are there. sir?"

1595
00:56:54.456 --> 00:56:56.666
Now I'm fucking scared.

1596
00:56:56.708 --> 00:56:58.918
I pick up the pace.
I start running.

1597
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.086
I catch up to the Black guy
in the front.

1598
00:57:00.128 --> 00:57:03.298
I grab his arm.
I said. "Hey. man. Hey!

1599
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.424
"What's the plan?

1600
00:57:04.466 --> 00:57:06.343
What's the fucking plan?"

1601
00:57:06.384 --> 00:57:08.219
He looked me dead in the eyes.
I'll never forget it.

1602
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:09.596
I said. "What's the plan?"

1603
00:57:09.637 --> 00:57:12.098
He said.
"Nigga. you better go home."

1604
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.351
I said. "What?"

1605
00:57:14.392 --> 00:57:16.561
"Nigga. you better take
your stupid ass home.

1606
00:57:16.603 --> 00:57:19.064
"out here running around
in them dumb-ass khakis.

1607
00:57:19.105 --> 00:57:21.775
"holding up
that stupid-ass sign.

1608
00:57:21.816 --> 00:57:23.068
"What the fuck
does that sign say?

1609
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:24.611
Does that say.
'Black people rock'?"

1610
00:57:24.652 --> 00:57:26.571
I said. "Yes. it does."

1611
00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:29.324
He said. "What the fuck
that got to do with anything?"

1612
00:57:29.366 --> 00:57:31.659
I said. "Mm-mm-mm."

1613
00:57:31.701 --> 00:57:32.869
He said.
"Take your stupid ass home

1614
00:57:32.911 --> 00:57:33.995
before you get yourself
killed."

1615
00:57:34.037 --> 00:57:36.331
I got emotional.
I start crying.

1616
00:57:36.373 --> 00:57:37.749
"I can't.
It's not that easy.

1617
00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:39.501
I can't just leave.
I can't."

1618
00:57:39.542 --> 00:57:41.127
He said. "Why not?"

1619
00:57:41.169 --> 00:57:42.671
I said. "Because I don't know
where I parked at.

1620
00:57:42.712 --> 00:57:44.964
We been running
for a long time."

1621
00:57:45.006 --> 00:57:46.800
I took out my valet ticket.
I gave it to him.

1622
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:49.803
I said. "Can you help me
find my car. please?

1623
00:57:49.844 --> 00:57:51.596
"I'll tip you
if you help me find my car.

1624
00:57:51.638 --> 00:57:52.972
I'll tip you."

1625
00:57:53.014 --> 00:57:54.349
He said. "I don't know
where your fucking car at.

1626
00:57:54.391 --> 00:57:56.643
You better ask
one of them niggas over there."

1627
00:57:56.685 --> 00:57:59.020
I said. "Excuse me.

1628
00:57:59.062 --> 00:58:00.271
"Excuse me.

1629
00:58:00.313 --> 00:58:02.524
"Niggas over there.

1630

1631
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:05.985
One of them turned around.
He was Mexican.

1632
00:58:06.027 --> 00:58:10.532
He looked at me.
He said. "Oh.

1633
00:58:10.573 --> 00:58:13.827

1634
00:58:13.868 --> 00:58:15.328
Ladies and gentlemen.
