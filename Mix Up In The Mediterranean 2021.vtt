Yeah. I know. I just--

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.934
I got a little inspired.

12

39

You could always come back

and kissing babies.

- Hello.
- Hi! We're act--

75
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.000
Mr. Westcott. I would just love
to talk about working together.

76
00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.967
Perhaps partnering my
restaurants with your hotels?

77
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.066
Well. we have a food
and beverage department.

78
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.400
although we need
someone to run it.

79
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:25.133
Dad. I'm sure he has
bigger things to worry about.

80
00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.233
He's one of our chefs.

81
00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:28.400
I'm sorry.
"one of your chefs"?

82
00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:31.900
Uh. yes. I'm actually running
the culinary contest in Malta.

83
00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:36.000
Oh. I thought that Heike Mueller
was in charge of that.

84
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.900
Oh. yes.

85
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:41.100

the Academy and the contest.

87
00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:43.934

but you're not in charge

88

picking of the winner.

89
00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:48.600
Uh. no.
That would be the judges.

90
00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:50.000
Oh. well that's okay.
That's okay.

91
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:51.767
Of course someone
has to be there to. um.

92
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.834
make sure that the trophy
can be handed to me when I win.

93
00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:56.133
(chuckling)
Of course.

94
00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:57.934
Wow. you're very confident.

95
00:03:58.066 --> 00:03:59.300
Well. that's a good thing.
isn't it?

96
00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:02.834
Mr. Westcott. I'm gonna whip up
something extra special

97
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.066
just for you.

98
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.934

What's up. little brother?

101
00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.333
Okay. you're
five minutes older than me.

102
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:15.700
Oh. still counts. How's AK?

103
00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:17.066
Cold. How's NYC?

104
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.166

107

Julian:
Listen. Um.

109
00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:31.233
I am allowed one extra guest
for the competition

110
00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:33.667
and I was thinking maybe
you would want to come.

111
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
To Malta? That--
Yeah. I can't do that.

112
00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:38.900
I can buy you
the plane ticket

113
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:40.200
if that's what
you're worried about.

114
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.066
I can afford
my own plane ticket. Julian.

115
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.233
Julian:
I didn't mean that!

116
00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:44.734
Didn't mean what?

117
00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:46.633
That you're a big. fancy chef
with your bistro in New York

118
00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:49.400
and I'm just a lowly cook
at a diner in Yakutat?

Josh. why are you still there.
hm?

120
00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.133
It's not like it's even
a famous restaurant anymore.

121
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:54.567
Yeah. well. it's gonna be.

122

L'histoire se répète.

123

Why do you pretend
that you're French?

124
00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:00.734
I hate that.
You grew up in Alaska.

125
00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.367
What does that even mean?

126
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.367
It means history repeating.
Okay?

You are passing up
on a trip to Malta.

128
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.600
You passed up on my offer to
get out of that greasy kitchen

129
00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:10.567
and come work here
when Dad died.

130
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.800

131

culinary schools in Paris.

132
00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.266
That was 15 years ago.
Somebody had to stay behind.

133

Thank you!

176
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:20.567
Uh. maybe we'll. uh...we'll run
into each other again sometime.

177
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.467
- Uh. yeah!
- Yeah.

178
00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:29.233
Who was that?

179
00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:31.700
Julian Northrup?

180
00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:35.033
He's one of our chefs
in the competition.

181
00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:36.867
That was very interesting.

182
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.367
Interesting how?

183
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.834
Last week when I ran into him
in New York. he seemed so...

184
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.500
But today he seemed
really nice!

185
00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:46.533
And he looks
so different.

186
00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.000
So casual.

187
00:07:49.133 --> 00:07:50.400
And handsome?

188
00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:51.533
He has a husband.

189
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:52.834
Oh. I can see
how this would put a crimp

190
00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:55.900
in your dating plans.

191
00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:57.500
(chuckling)
Yes!

192
00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:01.300
(doorbell ringing)

193
00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:02.934
Well. you can take the boy
out of Alaska

194
00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.300
but you cannot take the Alaska
out of the boy.

195
00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:07.734
Well. it's good
to see you too. Julian.

196
00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:09.467
Come here.

197
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.667
Yeah. whoop.

198
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.266
Mm-hm.

199
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.767
(chuckling)
All right.

200
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.166
(inhaling)

201
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.934
Hello! Look at this.

202
00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.734
- Josh.
- Henry.

203
00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:22.934
It's so good to see you!

204
00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:25.233
- Oh. man!
- It's been too long.

205
00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:27.667
I know! What- three years
since the wedding.

206
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.066
It's too long.

207
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.300
Look at you two. It's like
somebody picked up Julian

208
00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:33.600
and dropped him off
in the wilderness

209
00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:35.166
and left him there
for a few weeks.

210
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.266
(laughing)
Well. I'll tell ya.

211
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.500
after a few weeks
in the wilderness.

212
00:08:37.633 --> 00:08:38.734
he would look a lot worse
than this.

213
00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:40.333
- I concur.
- Hey. hey. hey.

214
00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:41.734
No ganging up
on the chef. okay?

215
00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:43.266
I have to concentrate
on the competition.

216
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.567
Mm. it's too bad I got all the
culinary talent in the family.

217
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.166
Oh. please!
I can cook circles around you.

218
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.233
Okay. I'm a better chef.
and I'm taller.

219
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.066
You are not!

220
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.467
Mm.

221
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.500
Um. yeah. I should go crash.

222
00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:01.333
Okay.

223
00:09:01.467 --> 00:09:05.033
So. uh...all right!

224
00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.900
See y'all tomorrow.

225
00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:09.633
- Goodnight. Josh.
- Of course. Goodnight!

226
00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:10.734
(door closing)

227
00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:12.066
(sighing)

228
00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:22.200
Ms. Mueller!
Welcome to Hotel Phoenicia.

229
00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:23.800
Why are there
so many flowers?

230
00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:26.500
The food should be
the star here. Meg.

231
00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.500
Uh. Ms. Mueller.
this is Annie Leroux.

232
00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:29.900
she is the general manager
of the hotel.

233
00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:31.333
It's nice to meet you.

234
00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:33.834
You must be excited to be
having a worldwide audience

235
00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:35.400
for the competition this year.
- Of course.

236
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.867
The board approved
your plan. Ms. Westcott.

237
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
but I shall be
watching closely.

238
00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:45.867
She seems nice?
(chuckling)

239
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.533
Julian: Hey. the blue tie
or the green tie?

240
00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:49.700
Green.

241
00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:51.400
You didn't even look!
- I didn't need to.

242
00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:55.166
It's perfect for spring
and it brings out your eyes.

243
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.400
Well. I just love
that you know that.

244
00:09:57.533 --> 00:09:58.867
(knocking at door)

245
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.033
It's open!

246
00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:03.500
Ta-da! (chuckling)

247
00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:04.633
Is this better?

248
00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:07.367
Hmm.

249
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.300
- What's wrong with it?
- You're gonna be a room

250
00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:10.533
with the culinary elite.

251
00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:12.367
The crème de la crme
of the cooking world.

252
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.700
You need to dress as if you were
going to a fancy restaurant.

253
00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:16.734
Mm.

254
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.166
This is literally
how I would dress

255
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.400
if I was going
to a fancy restaurant.

256
00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:21.700
- Agh.
- We are not related.

257
00:10:21.834 --> 00:10:23.400
There is no way
that I share DNA with this man.

258
00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:25.200
Come on. let's go.

259
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.667
(sighing) I can't believe
I'm still dressing my brother.

260
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.166
I'm putting you in blue!

261
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.834
Julian. just be
a bit more careful with the--

262
00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:32.467
Ow. oh! Ooh!
(thudding)

263
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.800
Oh. it's my back again.

264
00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:34.967
Julian! What happened?

265
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.400
He injured his back
when we redid the house

266
00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:38.700
and he tried to lift
a big stove.

267
00:10:38.834 --> 00:10:40.734
It was crooked. okay?
Ow!

268
00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:42.633
Henry:
Can you stand up?

269
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.500
Stand up.
Can you stand up?

270
00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:46.667
(grunting)

271
00:10:49.934 --> 00:10:52.900
- Henry: Oh. my goodness.
- Julian: Yep. yep. yep. Okay.

272
00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:55.333
- Lay down. lay down.
- Okay.

273
00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:57.533
Julian. you gotta register
in the next 20 minutes.

274
00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:58.567
otherwise you can't compete.

275
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.533
Well. can't you go
register for him?

276
00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:01.633
No. no. I have to do it.

277
00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:02.934
I can....
- Be careful.

278
00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:04.400
I can do this. I...

279
00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:06.400
No. Julian. Just don't. You're
gonna make yourself worse.

280
00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:09.233
Nn-mm. Nope. Nope.

281
00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:12.867
(sighing) Oh my gosh.
What am I gonna do?

282
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.867
Oh! Oh. Give me your ID.

283
00:11:16.033 --> 00:11:16.967
Excuse me?

284
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.300
I'll go register for you.

285
00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:19.700
Julian.
it's not gonna be the first time

286
00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:21.400
that we pretended
to be each other.

287
00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:23.433
We used to do it
all the time!

288
00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:26.900
No. no. no. We were kids. Okay.
what if someone finds out?!

289
00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:28.900
Yeah. I just gotta go
sign a form. right?

290
00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:31.767
I don't really think you've got
a choice. Give him the ID.

291
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.133
Give him the ID.
- I...

292
00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:36.934
Ugh. fine! Gimme.

293
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:40.266
(sighing) You be friendly. okay?
And you smile.

294
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.166
And try to say French words
every once in a while.

295
00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:46.033
Uh. yeah.
I don't know French.

296
00:11:46.166 --> 00:11:49.100
Oui. bonjour. merci!
Stick to the basics.

297
00:11:49.233 --> 00:11:53.266
Okay. okay! Jeez. I can be you
for like. five minutes. right?

298
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.633
Hey. no. no. no.

299
00:11:54.767 --> 00:11:56.834
Not looking like that you can't.

300
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.367
(Soft jazz playing)

301
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.533
- Julian?
- No.

302
00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:13.266
Julian Northrup?
Is that you?

303
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.266
Uh. oui! Yes. 'tis I.
Julian Northrup.

304
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.033
And-and you are?

305
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.834
(scoffing)
Etienne Leduc!

306
00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:22.934
I put on a few pounds.

307
00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:25.767
You probably remember me
from culinary school?

308
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.867
Yeah!

309
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.767
I have the weakness
for the cream sauce!

310
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.533
Cream sauce. yes!
Culinary school. I remember.

311
00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:33.967
Yes.
- Classmates. now competitors.

312
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.100
How fun. huh?
- (laughing)

313
00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:39.767
Oui. Oui. yes. fun. That is
exactly how I would put it.

314
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.934
- I need to--
- I think it's. uh.

315
00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:42.600
I think it's very generous
of them

316
00:12:42.734 --> 00:12:45.100
that they allow you
to participate.

317
00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:46.467
Generous. how's that?

318
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600
It's no secret
your restaurant is struggling.

319
00:12:49.734 --> 00:12:53.800
- No. It is not.
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

320
00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:57.033
huh? I mean. not everyone can
have the kind of success

321
00:12:57.166 --> 00:12:59.633
I've had with my bistros.

322
00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.000
But you know. I'm sure
simply here will help. huh?

323
00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:03.500
So. do not worry
if you get cut out

324
00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:04.700
from one
of the early rounds.

325
00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:08.200
(laughing)
Well. excusez-moi.

326
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:10.166
but I don't intend
to get cut at all.

327
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.600
That's the spirit. huh?

328
00:13:11.734 --> 00:13:13.333
Lovely to see you again.
Julian!

329
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.667
(sighing)

330
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.066
Chef Northrup. hi!

331
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.767
Are you ready now?

332
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.166
Oh. hi! You. uh...

333
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.166
Bonjour. bonjour-- ah.
and ready for what?

334
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.433
To register.

335
00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:32.133
I have everything set up
for you right over there.

336
00:13:33.567 --> 00:13:36.233
Oh! You-- yes. you work
for the Escoffier.

337
00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:40.100
Of course! That's just--
très bon!

338
00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:42.667
Oh! That's right.
you trained in France.

339
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.367
J'ai étudié à Paris.
Je parle Français.

340
00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:47.834
Oui?

341
00:13:47.967 --> 00:13:52.266
(stammering) Uh. so.
where is your husband Henry?

342
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.867
My husband is packing.

343
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.333
Unpacking. He's unpacking.

344
00:13:58.467 --> 00:13:59.600
Upstairs.

345
00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:02.233
Uh. well.
I look forward to meeting him.

346
00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:03.600
Mm.

347
00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:06.433
You two. I have to say.
make the most handsome couple.

348
00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:08.133
Ah! (chuckling)

349
00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:10.667
Well. hey. I am--
(clearing throat)

350
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.967
Um. so it says here
that he is your sous chef?

351
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.600
- Mm. yes.
- And you have one other guest.

352
00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.834
your brother Josh?
Is he a chef too?

353
00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:21.000
Uh. more of a cook. but yeah.

354
00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:23.400
Oh. well maybe one day
he'll be at the competition.

355
00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:25.834
(laughing) Maybe.

356
00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:29.367
Okay. So. I just need you
to sign the contract.

357
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.266
- I'm sorry. um. this contract?
- Yeah.

358
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.800
It just says that
you understand the rules.

359
00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:37.166
you agree to be photographed.
you are who you say you are.

360
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.667
- (chuckling)
- You can just sign right here.

361
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.567
You need my ID.
Do you need my ID? I have it.

362
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.834
No. no. I know who you are.

363
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.000
Unless you have
an evil twin or something.

364
00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:47.233
(chuckling)

365
00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:50.500
(clearing throat)
So. where do I sign?

366
00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:53.233
Uh. right where it says
"chef's signature".

367
00:14:53.367 --> 00:14:56.834
Wow. yes. (chuckling) That's...
Gonna sign.

368
00:14:56.967 --> 00:14:59.567
- Yeah.
- Yep.

369
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.166
Um...

370
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.233
Oh. "J Northrup".
Staying on brand.

371
00:15:05.367 --> 00:15:08.900
- Yeah. Something like that.
- I like it.

372
00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:10.967
And also. can I see
your right wrist. please?

373
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.233
- Sure.
- Thank you.

374
00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:17.066
Just put it through there.

375
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.066
Is that tight enough?

376
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.066
Yeah.

377
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.467
Perfect.

378
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.233
What is this?

379
00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:26.700
It's your chef bracelet.
- Oh.

380
00:15:26.834 --> 00:15:28.033
There's a chip inside
that you'll need

381
00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:30.400
at your work station
before you use it.

382
00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:32.333
It's our way of keeping
the culinary espionage

383
00:15:32.467 --> 00:15:34.033
down to a minimum.
- (chuckling)

384
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:37.834
Okay. So. when I need to take
it off. like for a shower...

385
00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:39.233
Oh. it's waterproof.

386
00:15:39.367 --> 00:15:41.166
You keep it on until
the end of the event.

387
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.900
If you take it off before.
you can't compete. So--

388
00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:44.367
What if it-- it breaks?

389
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.900
Oh. these things
are indestructible.

390
00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:48.467
(chuckling) Good luck.

391
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.166
Okay.

392
00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:54.867
(sighing)

393
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.300
I think we have a problem.

394
00:16:01.834 --> 00:16:03.433
I'm gonna have to drop out
of the competition.

395
00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:05.767
Josh: Hey. so what's going on
with the restaurant?

396
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.767
Because I ran into.
uh. Etienne?

397
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.567
Is that something?
Downstairs?

398
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.066
He said that
J Northrup was in trouble.

399
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.367
Well. this just keeps
getting better.

400
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.600
The bank's
about to foreclose.

401
00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:17.700
We overextended
with the renovation

402
00:16:17.834 --> 00:16:19.200
and we need the prize money.

403
00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:20.233
Along with the recognition

404
00:16:20.367 --> 00:16:21.800
that comes with
winning the competition.

405
00:16:21.934 --> 00:16:23.467
Without it. we're sunk.

406
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.300
I'm gonna lose
the restaurant.

407
00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:30.934
No. you won't.

408
00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:32.900
I can't compete
without the wristband.

409
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:36.200
- Exactly.
- Then I will compete as you.

410
00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:39.467
What? That's crazy.
Why would you do that?

411
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.800
Why would I--?
Because you're my brother!

412
00:16:43.934 --> 00:16:45.100
And the Northrup family
needs a win.

413
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:46.333
Yeah.

414
00:16:48.233 --> 00:16:49.433
You can teach me
all the recipes.

415
00:16:49.567 --> 00:16:50.934
Henry's your sous chef.
I'm sure he knows

416
00:16:51.066 --> 00:16:52.734
how to make everything
just as good as you do.

417
00:16:52.867 --> 00:16:55.934
Josh. these people
are professionals. Okay?

418
00:16:56.066 --> 00:16:58.934
They're gonna be watching your
every move from how you mix.

419
00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.600
to your knife skills.

420
00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:02.100
They're gonna take
one look at you and--

421
00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:04.934
And see what? That I'm just
a diner cook from Alaska?

422
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.533
I know my way
around a kitchen!

423
00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:08.800
It's not the same.
Tu ne m'écoutes pas!

424
00:17:08.934 --> 00:17:10.100
Stop talking in French!

425
00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:11.667
All right. stop it. both of you.
Both of you stop.

426
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.867
(groaning)

427
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.500
Tomorrow is apprentice day.

428
00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:18.166
We show up
and we see what happens.

429
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.300
What have we to lose? Huh?

430
00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:24.700
He can't just cook like me.
Okay? You have to be me.

431
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:27.200
You have to dress
like me. yes.

432
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:31.266
but you'd also have to
carry yourself like me.

433
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.967
I can do this.

434
00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:40.867
Okay. Okay!

435
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.200
But we're not practicing
in the competition area

436
00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:44.266
with everybody watching.

437
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.600
We're gonna have to go
somewhere else

438
00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:48.266
and you're gonna have to do
everything that I say.

439
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.100
You will follow the recipe.

440
00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:52.066
Deal?

441
00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:56.567
- Deal.
- Henry: Yes.

442
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.700
- Hors d'oeuvre?
- Ooh...

443
00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:05.000
So we'll mingle for five minutes
and then we'll slip away.

444
00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:08.133
all right? Just remember
it's an elegant event--

445
00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:09.400
- Yeah. yeah.
- Cocktail party.

446
00:18:09.533 --> 00:18:11.066
It's not some bar
with peanut shells on the floor.

447
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.166
Hey!

448
00:18:13.367 --> 00:18:14.233
Chef Northrop!

449
00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:15.900
Hi! Welcome.

450
00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:18.967
Ah. Miss Westcott.
Ah. bonjour.

451
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.967
Please. call me Meg.
Don't you look sharp?

452
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.166
Thank you. And you look. um...

453
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.166
I mean. wow.

454
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.000
(chuckling)

455
00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:29.467
Doesn't-- she looks
très. trs fabulous.

456
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.066
- Oh. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

457
00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:39.333
I'm-I'm Henry.
I'm Julian's husband.

458
00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:40.667
Oh. it's so nice
to finally meet you.

459
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.033
I'm Meg Westcott.
I'm the event director

460
00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:45.533
at the l'Élite
Culinary Institute.

461
00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.533
Yeah. so you two have met?
- Mm-hm.

462
00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:49.633
Oh. we go way back.

463
00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:51.133
(chuckling)

464
00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.200
I'm sure he's told you all about
my obsession with chocolate.

465
00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:55.867
No. No. no. he hasn't.

466
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.533
Why don't I introduce you
to the chefs?

467
00:18:57.667 --> 00:18:59.734
- No.
- Yeah! They're right this way.

468
00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:00.800
Yeah. I'd love to meet them.

469
00:19:00.934 --> 00:19:02.734
- Yes.
- Come on.

470
00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.033
Meg:
Good afternoon.

471
00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:10.033
Hi! I would love to introduce
you to Chef Julian Northrup

472
00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.433
from the United States.

473
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:12.767
This is his husband Henry.

474
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.400
Patrick O'Shea from Ireland.
- Good to see you.

475
00:19:14.533 --> 00:19:16.533
And then there's Chef
Deirdre Zidane from Germany.

476
00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:17.900
Hi.

477
00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.033
And then of course
you remember Etienne LeDuc.

478
00:19:20.166 --> 00:19:21.467
representing France.

479
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.633
Yeah!

480
00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:23.800
Bonjour.

481
00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:25.767
You went to culinary school
together. right?

482
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.867
What was that like?

483
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.066
Ogh.

484
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.033
Oh. the stories
I could tell!

485
00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:32.467
Please. I'd like to hear some
gossip about good old Etienne.

486
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.433
Yes. Julian.
I would love to hear some tales

487
00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:36.934
of the good old days.
- (Josh nervous chuckling)

488
00:19:37.066 --> 00:19:37.967
Henry:
I could tell the story.

489
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.567
Yeah?

490
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.734
The story about when you were
in the last year at l'Élite.

491
00:19:42.867 --> 00:19:44.433
and Etienne.

492
00:19:44.567 --> 00:19:47.133
he shut himself away
in his room. uh--

493
00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:49.100
(laughing)

494
00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:52.200
--for three days.
trying to perfect the soufflé.

495
00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:53.700
(laughing)
- Really?

496
00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:55.033
And it was worth it.
though.

497
00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:57.033
'cause I haven't made
a bad soufflé since.

498
00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:59.066
Soufflés are easy.

499
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.700
A German strudel. now.
that is a complicated dessert.

500
00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.400
Oh. can I borrow you
for a second?

501
00:20:04.533 --> 00:20:05.867
I'd love to get
your opinion on something.

502
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.133
I don't think that
that's a good idea.

503
00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:08.600
- I--
- No.

504
00:20:08.734 --> 00:20:10.400
(whispering) I mean.
it's better than staying here.

505
00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:12.133
Julian?

506
00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:14.233
(sighing) Julian.

507
00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:16.100
(chuckling)
Cheers.

508
00:20:16.233 --> 00:20:19.100
Chefs are allowed to start using
their work stations tomorrow.

509
00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:21.734
and I just wanna make sure that
I have everything they need.

510
00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:23.900
Would you mind taking a look?
- Yes. of course.

511
00:20:24.033 --> 00:20:26.934
I mean. I know my way
around a high-end kitchen.

512
00:20:27.066 --> 00:20:28.700
so I would be
the person to ask.

513
00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:31.467
But why me?
- Well. for starters.

514
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.400
you didn't tell Henry about
my secret stash of chocolate

515
00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:37.300
in my suitcase.
so you seem pretty trustworthy.

516
00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:40.100
And. I don't know.
From my first impression of you.

517
00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:42.767
you seem fairly brutal
with your honesty.

518
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.600
Which I could really use
right now.

519
00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:49.100
Okay. Um. oh. God.
Look at this place.

520
00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:51.900
I...I can't believe
I get to cook here.

521
00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:53.800
I can get so creative.

522
00:20:54.934 --> 00:20:56.734
So. you don't look at recipes?

523
00:20:56.867 --> 00:20:59.467
Oh. uh. well I do like
to go with my gut.

524
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.600
You know. it doesn't always
work out but when it does.

525
00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:04.133
it can be really
something special.

526
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.367
The kitchen. though.

527
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.667
The kitchen is...yes!

528
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.266
I mean. this is--
it looks perfect.

529
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.533
I mean. you must
really know cooking.

530
00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:16.800
(chuckling)
Oh. no. I don't cook.

531
00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:20.166
I love events.
That's my passion.

532
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.266
You know. creating all this.
Coming up with ideas.

533
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.667
Making it happen.

534
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.266
Watching people just get lost
in all of it.

535
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.467
How long
you been doing that?

536
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.133
Well. I've done
a couple smaller parties

537
00:21:32.266 --> 00:21:34.200
at the hotels
that my dad owns.

538
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:36.600
but this is my first
big. major event

539
00:21:36.734 --> 00:21:38.967
and I need it to go well if
I wanna launch my own company.

540
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.700
Wait. your father's hotel--
that--

541
00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:45.133
Your father--
your father is Preston Westcott.

542
00:21:45.266 --> 00:21:47.467
Yeah.

543
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.033
You met him last week
at your restaurant?

544
00:21:49.166 --> 00:21:52.834
Yes! Yeah. of course.

545
00:21:52.967 --> 00:21:55.300
Of course. it's just like--
the jetlag. it's just--

546
00:21:55.433 --> 00:21:57.266
- Oh.
- --whew.

547
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.934
But your father
owns this hotel.

548
00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:01.700
Yeah. he does.

549
00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:04.233
But I don't really like
to advertise that

550
00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:08.667
because I wanna build
my reputation on my own merits

551
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.200
before I launch my company.

552
00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:13.266
Well. I mean. from what I can
see. you are more than ready.

553
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.934
Well. thank you.

554
00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:17.433
And thank you
for calming my nerves.

555
00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:18.600
You so didn't
have to do this.

556
00:22:18.734 --> 00:22:21.100
It's probably
the last thing you wanna do.

557
00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:23.100
No. No. it's--

558
00:22:23.233 --> 00:22:25.700
I'm happy to help.

559
00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:28.433
You know I--

560
00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:30.667
I just can't
keep up with you.

561
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.033
It's like you're
two different people.

562
00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:33.934
(chuckling)

563
00:22:34.066 --> 00:22:35.600
Hey. um. question.

564
00:22:36.867 --> 00:22:39.000
We're not required to use
these work stations

565
00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:41.166
to practice. are we?

566
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.900
You don't wanna get used
to the space?

567
00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:46.767
Yeah. it's just.
prying eyes and such?

568
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.200
Yes. oh! I didn't even
think about that.

569
00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:51.700
Yeah. no. for sure.
We could--

570
00:22:51.834 --> 00:22:53.367
You know what? You can practice
anywhere you want.

571
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.400
Great.

572
00:22:55.533 --> 00:22:57.600
Well. we should probably
head back.

573
00:22:57.734 --> 00:22:59.867
- Yeah.
- Thank you again.

574
00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:02.166
Yeah. any time.

575
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.900
(laughing)

576
00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:07.433
- Who's that?
- That? I-- I don't know.

577
00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:09.233
Julian?

578
00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:10.567
Hmm?

579
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.600
Julian Northrup?
It's so good to see you!

580
00:23:13.734 --> 00:23:14.934
- Ah!
- Henry: Chester!

581
00:23:15.066 --> 00:23:16.066
Chester Peele. Chester.

582
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.166
You remember
Chester Peele.

583
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.600
Chester Pe-- Yes! Chester!

584
00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:22.066
I thought you said
you didn't know him.

585
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.734
I-- Well. you know.
it's just so bright. And I--

586
00:23:25.867 --> 00:23:27.400
It is.

587
00:23:27.533 --> 00:23:29.834
Julian and I were in Malta
a few years ago.

588
00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:31.300
We bumped into Chester
at his restaurant.

589
00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:32.333
Chester's By the Sea.

590
00:23:32.467 --> 00:23:34.767
Remember? Yeah.
we became fast friends.

591
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.767
And uh. he's given us
a lot of fantastic advice

592
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.500
before we opened up
J Northrup.

593
00:23:39.633 --> 00:23:41.900
Well. I hope you didn't listen
to me. Chester's is no more.

594
00:23:42.033 --> 00:23:44.400
C'est la vie.
- Henry: Oh. sorry.

595
00:23:44.533 --> 00:23:46.734
Chef Peele.
what are doing here?

596
00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:48.066
This is
an invitation only event.

597
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.333
Heike. old friend!
I thought you'd appreciate

598
00:23:51.467 --> 00:23:54.166
having a former winner
of the Escoffier drop by

599
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.667
to encourage your latest crop
of competitors.

600
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.266
You came because you knew
it would annoy me.

601
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.333
Well. yes. that too.

602
00:24:01.467 --> 00:24:03.533
You see. I was the youngest
winner in Escoffier history

603
00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:05.200
at the tender age of 25.

604
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:06.800
Heike's never really
gotten over the fact

605
00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:10.467
that I beat her at
the very contest she now runs.

606
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.133
Ever since she took over
the Escoffier

607
00:24:12.266 --> 00:24:16.000
my invitations to events seem to
have gotten lost in the mail.

608
00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:20.500
Can you see that this gentleman
is escorted from the party?

609
00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:23.900
Overseeing security is part
of your job. isn't it?

610
00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:26.066
Oh. Uh. yeah.
I'll take care of it.

611
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.467
I'm going! But only because
Meg is so gracious.

612
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.800
Isn't she. Julian?

613
00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:32.800
(nervous chuckling)
Yes.

614
00:24:32.934 --> 00:24:34.567
Yeah. we-- yeah. yeah.

615
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.166
You're being
very peculiar today.

616
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.300
Don't let this stuffy
little contest change you.

617
00:24:39.433 --> 00:24:40.300
It isn't worth it.

618
00:24:40.433 --> 00:24:42.700
Until next time!

619
00:24:42.834 --> 00:24:43.834
Meg:
Right this way. please.

620
00:24:45.533 --> 00:24:46.834
- Seriously?
- Josh: Can we please leave?

621
00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:47.834
You are rubbish.

622
00:24:47.967 --> 00:24:49.100
Take this. Down it!

623
00:24:51.433 --> 00:24:52.400
Terrible job!

624
00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:55.300
Chester Peele
is the last thing we need

625
00:24:55.433 --> 00:24:56.967
if we're gonna pull this off.
- Josh: Yeah. I know.

626
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.333
Well. what about Etienne?

627
00:24:58.467 --> 00:25:00.133
Third.

628
00:25:00.266 --> 00:25:02.033
I put Meg Westcott
ahead of both of them.

629
00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:03.233
What is going on there?

630
00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:07.066
Nothing. no. No.
she actually wanted my opinion

631
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.233
about the kitchen setups. so.

632
00:25:09.367 --> 00:25:11.600
Actually. she wanted
Julian's "brutal honesty".

633
00:25:11.734 --> 00:25:13.100
Her words.

634
00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:14.633
- Hm.
- Hmm.

635
00:25:14.767 --> 00:25:15.934
Okay.
you need to be careful.

636
00:25:16.066 --> 00:25:17.633
because if she finds out.
we're in big trouble.

637
00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:18.934
Mmm.
(knocking at door)

638
00:25:19.066 --> 00:25:20.133
That'll be room service.

639
00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:21.700
I ordered you
an ice pack for your back.

640
00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:24.066
You know what? I'm actually
feeling a little better.

641
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.600
Yeah. you look
the very picture of health.

642
00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:26.633
Ah-ha-ha.

643
00:25:26.767 --> 00:25:29.734
Chester. um. oh--

644
00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:31.934
(clearing throat)

645
00:25:32.066 --> 00:25:34.233
There's two of you!

646
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.367
So. let me
get this straight.

647
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.900
You are pretending to be you
in order to compete

648
00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:47.633
in one of the most elite
culinary contests in the world?

649
00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:53.633
(chuckling)

650
00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:55.066
I love it!

651
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.734
Please don't tell anyone.

652
00:25:56.867 --> 00:25:58.033
Chester:
Tell anyone?

653
00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:01.033
I want to know
how I can help.

654
00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:12.767
Gentlemen. welcome to what's
left of Chester's By the Sea.

655
00:26:14.433 --> 00:26:15.834
Julian is not
gonna like this.

656
00:26:15.967 --> 00:26:17.700
Well. it doesn't really matter
what he likes

657
00:26:17.834 --> 00:26:19.367
until we can find a way
to sneak him out of the hotel

658
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.467
without people seeing
two Julian Northrups.

659
00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:27.166
Well. I thought of a way.
(sighs)

660
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.266
(door closing)

661
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.333
Julian.
what are you wearing?

662
00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.200
If you're me. then I am you.
Élémentaire.

663
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.066
Okay. well first of all.
I don't say things like

664
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.900
"element-bluh". whatever.

665
00:26:39.033 --> 00:26:41.000
Second of all.
what if somebody saw you?

666
00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:43.166
Um. I would just say
that I'm you?

667
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.033
- What about your back?
- I told you it felt better.

668
00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:47.367
Okay? Now if it wasn't
for that stupid bracelet.

669
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.834
I would compete myself.
Chester?

670
00:26:49.967 --> 00:26:51.900
This place is a disaster.
What happened?

671
00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:53.900
Well. let's just say
my talents in the kitchen

672
00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:56.567
far outweighed
my prowess in business.

673
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.734
I'm very sorry.

674
00:26:57.867 --> 00:27:00.367
I really don't
miss it at all.

675
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.400
Okay.
we're gonna need some supplies

676
00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:03.867
if we're gonna
make this work.

677
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.367
Henry. you get the ingredients
for the prep.

678
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.533
Josh.
I will make a list of things

679
00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:08.300
for you to get from
the completely kitchen.

680
00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:10.433
So you need me to go back
to the hotel?

681
00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:12.800
Like. as me or as you?

682
00:27:12.934 --> 00:27:14.700
As you. As me. As--

683
00:27:14.834 --> 00:27:16.533
No. as me. I think.
Yes. wait. no. Yes.

684
00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:20.367
I am--
I am you. you are me.

685
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.367
Dude.

686
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.767
- Okay. please stop.
- Okay.

687
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.967
All right. let me show you
how to use your RFID.

688
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.400
Okay.

689
00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:28.633
You scan your wristband
right here.

690
00:27:28.767 --> 00:27:29.633
Oh. okay.

691
00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:31.533
(beeping)
Oh.

692
00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.033
Just like that. and then it logs
you in and turns on the power.

693
00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:36.900
Great. And you're sure that it's
okay that I take a few things?

694
00:27:37.033 --> 00:27:38.233
Yeah. of course.

695
00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:41.400
Everything is there
for you to use as you see fit.

696
00:27:41.533 --> 00:27:43.467
So. where are you
gonna practice?

697
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.867
It's uh--
it's just a friend's.

698
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.233
Oh.

699
00:27:47.367 --> 00:27:48.800
So. I'm assuming that. uh.

700
00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:51.633
that everything's
going well with you?

701
00:27:51.767 --> 00:27:53.033
Uh. yeah.
I mean. no major complaints

702
00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.533
from the chefs so far.

703
00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:56.233
Although.

704
00:27:56.367 --> 00:27:59.734
I think Etienne is just dying
for something to go wrong.

705
00:27:59.867 --> 00:28:02.100
Oh. Well.
I'd imagine that you deal

706
00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:05.633
with a lot of difficult people
with your line of work.

707
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:08.133
Oh. Well. like I said. this is
my first really big event.

708
00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:09.967
Unless you count
my grandparents'

709
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.700
40th wedding anniversary
when I was 16.

710
00:28:11.834 --> 00:28:15.033
Wait. you planned
the whole party at 16?

711
00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:18.166
Should've seen
my grandmother's face.

712
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.367
That is what I want.

713
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.467
Well. you know.
you became her hero.

714
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.200
Who doesn't wanna
feel like that more often?

715
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.100
What made you
wanna become a chef?

716
00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:30.166
Um. my family
owned a restaurant

717
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.433
and my parents taught
my brother and I how to cook.

718
00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:34.867
Oh. that's right. Your brother.
I-- I keep forgetting.

719
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.367
Uh. you said
he was a cook too?

720
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.600
Yeah. yeah. At the place
that we used to own in Alaska.

721
00:28:39.734 --> 00:28:43.333
He wants to maybe take it
back over again someday.

722
00:28:43.467 --> 00:28:44.967
He didn't want to go
to culinary school like you?

723
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.533
He actually got a scholarship
just like I did.

724
00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:51.100
but he chose to stay.

725
00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:54.967
That's nice. You know.
carrying on the family legacy.

726
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.400
As long as he's happy.
that's the most important thing.

727
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.367
He is happy. isn't he?

728
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.734
Yeah. I think so. You know.

729
00:29:04.867 --> 00:29:07.867
I mean. sometimes he wonders.
I think.

730
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.734
what it would be like

731
00:29:09.867 --> 00:29:11.533
if he had taken that
scholarship after all. but.

732
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.166
I get that.

733
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.200
My dad wants me to come back
and work for him.

734
00:29:17.333 --> 00:29:20.600
and sometimes I think
it might be easier if I did.

735
00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:22.333
Yeah.
but would it be better?

736
00:29:26.567 --> 00:29:29.066
You know.
I have a little confession.

737
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.400
Uh-oh.

738
00:29:30.533 --> 00:29:32.166
(chuckling) When I first met you
at your restaurant.

739
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.433
I thought you were--

740
00:29:33.567 --> 00:29:36.900
well. thought you were
a bit of an arrogant jerk.

741
00:29:37.033 --> 00:29:38.333
(Josh laughing)

742
00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:42.233
No. that's. uh.
that is totally fair.

743
00:29:42.367 --> 00:29:44.066
(laughing)

744
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.600
But under the bravado. I think
you're a pretty decent guy.

745
00:29:48.734 --> 00:29:51.100
I'm really happy I'm getting
to know the real you.

746
00:29:53.367 --> 00:29:54.934
Yeah. so am I.

747
00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:57.600
Okay. well. let me know
if you need anything.

748
00:29:57.734 --> 00:29:59.266
- Mm.
- (chuckling)

749
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.233
Okay. so the competition
consists of three parts.

750
00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:09.433
Tomorrow. all ten chefs are
gonna serve up a bouillabaisse

751
00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:10.734
with fish and vegetables.

752
00:30:10.867 --> 00:30:12.567
Each chef provides
their own ingredients.

753
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.266
And five contestants move
forward to the second round.

754
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.934
which is chef's choice.

755
00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.667
But you have to use
the Black Diamond truffles

756
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.900
that they're providing
themselves.

757
00:30:21.033 --> 00:30:22.400
Okay. so we supply
the ingredients

758
00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:23.700
and they supply the truffles.
- Yeah.

759
00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:26.066
They cost $900 a pound.

760
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.567
What?!

761
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.200
Okay. food should not
cost that much.

762
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:32.266
- No. good food should.
- (chuckling)

763
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.700
Now. if we make it
to the next round.

764
00:30:34.834 --> 00:30:36.033
we are making a
handmade pasta

765
00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.367
with wine-braised short ribs
in a Burgundy sauce.

766
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.166
Ooh. that sounds good.
What about the finals?

767
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.767
Well. the top three chefs have
to create a classic peach Melba.

768
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.100
Anything goes really.

769
00:30:45.233 --> 00:30:46.834
but you have to include
the ingredients

770
00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:49.934
that Escoffier included when
he created the dish in 1892.

771
00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:53.233
Which is peaches. obviously.
raspberries.

772
00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:54.333
and vanilla ice cream.

773
00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:55.667
Ooh.
that could be really fun.

774
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.400
I can think of a few things
we could do with that.

775
00:30:57.533 --> 00:30:58.867
No. We are going traditional.

776
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.066
Mueller does not like things
outside of the box.

777
00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:03.433
(under his breath)
Okay. if you say so.

778
00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:05.100
(Henry chuckling)

779
00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:07.767
Well. that's so funny.
because I do.

780
00:31:11.133 --> 00:31:12.133
Meg:
Sir. Sir!

781
00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:14.800
Excuse me.
can I please get some chocolate?

782
00:31:14.934 --> 00:31:16.900
(sighing)
Or not.

783
00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:19.333
Josh:
Hey!

784
00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:22.266
What happened to the. uh.
emergency stash?

785
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.166
(sighing)
It's been a long week.

786
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.734
I didn't even have time
to eat today

787
00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:27.266
and everything's
already closed.

788
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.000
Well. you still have
the hotel kitchen.

789
00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:31.400
That's closed too.

790
00:31:31.533 --> 00:31:35.166
Okay. but your father
owns the hotel. remember?

791
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.467
(chuckling)

792
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.300
Listen. I know you wanna do
all that stuff on your own.

793
00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:41.467
but I mean.
this is a little sad.

794
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.233
- You do have a point.
- Mm-hm.

795
00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:45.900
Okay. yeah. Let's go.

796
00:31:46.033 --> 00:31:47.233
- Yeah? Come on!
- Yeah.

797
00:31:47.367 --> 00:31:49.300
What are you waiting for?

798
00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:52.400
Meg: What was it like
growing up in Alaska?

799
00:31:52.533 --> 00:31:54.767
Josh:
Cold. But the people are warm.

800
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.133
You know. the few of them
that are there. (chuckling)

801
00:31:59.266 --> 00:32:02.333
Does your brother
ever get lonely?

802
00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:04.200
Sometimes. Yeah.

803
00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:06.834
Um. I like to tell him
that he should go to a place

804
00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:09.000
where the people
outnumber the bears.

805
00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:10.300
(chuckling)

806
00:32:10.433 --> 00:32:13.266
Every now and then.
I think I prefer the bears.

807
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.300
You're so lucky
that you have Henry.

808
00:32:17.433 --> 00:32:19.567
He's a really great guy.

809
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.400
Yeah. he really is.

810
00:32:21.533 --> 00:32:25.800
Um. do-- do you
happen to have someone?

811
00:32:27.333 --> 00:32:28.700
A boyfriend?

812
00:32:28.834 --> 00:32:30.033
Or--

813
00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:32.400
I-- no.

814
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:37.367
I. uh...I was dating someone
a couple years ago.

815
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.600
and then I found out
he was lying to me.

816
00:32:43.867 --> 00:32:45.400
He told me
he was going to the office

817
00:32:45.533 --> 00:32:47.900
when really
he had quit his job

818
00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:52.133
and he was staying at home
all day playing video games.

819
00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:54.333
Um. that's too bad.

820
00:32:54.467 --> 00:32:56.400
Maybe he was just.
you know. scared

821
00:32:56.533 --> 00:33:00.700
or ashamed to tell you
what was really going on.

822
00:33:00.834 --> 00:33:02.700
Listen. if he had told me.
that would've been fine.

823
00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:04.433
People change jobs
all the time.

824
00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:06.567
But he lied about it

825
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.567
and he kept
lying about it...

826
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.934
over and over
and I just--

827
00:33:13.066 --> 00:33:15.467
I hated that I bought into it.
you know?

828
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.767
Yeah.

829
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.100
Anyways. after that.
I tried to make it work

830
00:33:19.233 --> 00:33:22.533
but he failed
the two-month test.

831
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:26.300
The two-month test.
what is that?

832
00:33:26.433 --> 00:33:30.233
I read somewhere that
if you can't get over the hurt

833
00:33:30.367 --> 00:33:34.133
or the anger after two months.
you probably never will.

834
00:33:34.266 --> 00:33:35.133
It'll always be there.

835
00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:38.200
- Huh.
- So. we tried again

836
00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:40.934
for a couple more months.
but...

837
00:33:41.066 --> 00:33:43.533
I haven't really
dated anyone since.

838
00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:47.700
It's not the easiest
for me to trust someone.

839
00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:49.533
Well. you know.

840
00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:52.433
I'm sure that you'll eventually
find the right person.

841
00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:56.066
I mean. look at me.
I'm just the most arrogant jerk.

842
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.734
(chuckling)
And I found the right guy.

843
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.800
Henry:
Julian?

844
00:34:02.934 --> 00:34:04.667
Juli-- Have you seen Josh?

845
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.600
He's not in his room.

846
00:34:06.734 --> 00:34:08.500
Have you--
have you changed?

847
00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:10.767
Yeah. I couldn't take
another minute in that flannel.

848
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.633
It was so scratchy.

849
00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:13.967
We've got to go
and look for Josh

850
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.033
and you can't go
looking like--

851
00:34:15.166 --> 00:34:16.467
(sighing)
--yourself.

852
00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:20.700
Well. I will be careful.

853
00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:21.867
You all right?

854
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.734
Yeah. I look good.

855
00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:29.667
Josh:
So. uh. what are the qualities

856
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.166
that you look for in a guy?

857
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.000
(Meg giggling)

858
00:34:34.133 --> 00:34:35.367
Other than not a liar?

859
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.300
(chuckling)
- Hmm.

860
00:34:37.433 --> 00:34:38.834
I don't know.
The normal stuff.

861
00:34:38.967 --> 00:34:41.266
It would be nice
if he had a job.

862
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.367
A place of his own.
good teeth.

863
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.467
That would be a bonus.

864
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.200
Mmm. okay.
Employment. housing. dental.

865
00:34:47.333 --> 00:34:49.934
Ooh. go on!
(chuckling)

866
00:34:50.066 --> 00:34:52.100
I love ambition.

867
00:34:52.233 --> 00:34:54.166
I don't even care
what you do.

868
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.667
If you wanna paint. paint.
Or if you're a street musician.

869
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.100
As long as you have ambition.

870
00:35:00.233 --> 00:35:01.166
Hmm.

871
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.767
I know I've been
really fortunate.

872
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.767
but I wanna earn
my own success.

873
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.367
I don't want people
to just think

874
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.333
everything's just been
handed to me.

875
00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:12.200
Oh. I would never
think that about you.

876
00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:14.867
I don't think anyone
would think that about you.

877
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.834
I mean. you're good.
(chuckling)

878
00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:19.667
(indistinct chatter)

879
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.033
I'm just--

880
00:35:22.166 --> 00:35:23.600
(sighing)
I'm just so glad I met you.

881
00:35:23.734 --> 00:35:25.934
Oh. Uh-- Julian.

882
00:35:26.066 --> 00:35:27.233
I'm really glad
I met you too.

883
00:35:27.367 --> 00:35:28.233
(mouthing words)

884
00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:31.767
(whispering)

885
00:35:34.133 --> 00:35:36.500
(sighing) I wish I could
meet a guy like you.

886
00:35:36.633 --> 00:35:37.934
Mm-hm.

887
00:35:38.066 --> 00:35:40.500
Except for the part about
you being happily married.

888
00:35:42.233 --> 00:35:43.533
Right.

889
00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:45.767
I mean. other than that.

890
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.367
we'd be just...perfect
for each other.

891
00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:58.166
So. you have to be meticulous
but there is a time limit

892
00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300
and we have to measure
everything.

893
00:35:59.433 --> 00:36:00.400
We have to be precise.

894
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:03.567
Taking instructions from Henry.
Julian?

895
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.700
Agh.

896
00:36:04.834 --> 00:36:05.967
Josh:
Uh. hello. Etienne.

897
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.300
You know.
Henry and I are partners.

898
00:36:07.433 --> 00:36:10.100
so we work together.
We listen to each other.

899
00:36:10.233 --> 00:36:13.633
And yet it is only your name
that'll go on the trophy.

900
00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:15.200
should you win.

901
00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:16.800
Although.
I don't think that is something

902
00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:18.934
you should be worrying about.
(chuckling)

903
00:36:19.066 --> 00:36:19.967
Henry:
Oh. Etienne.

904
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.567
Go and review your recipe

905
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.266
or hang upside-down
in the corner.

906
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.567
whatever it is
you do to prepare.

907
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.934
Such a delight.
Henry. huh?

908
00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:28.967
I was only wishing
my good old friend Julian luck.

909
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.567
Oh. well. you know.
don't really need luck

910
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.400
when you have skills.
(scraping knives loudly)

911
00:36:38.734 --> 00:36:41.100
You are becoming more and more
like Julian every single day.

912
00:36:41.233 --> 00:36:42.800
- Think I scared him.
- You scared him!

913
00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.467
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen.

914
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.967

will begin in 30 minutes.

915
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.266
Oh. come on.

916
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.033
What? You say something?

917
00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:52.900
- (inhaling sharply) Chop.
- Yeah. Sorry.

918
00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:58.767
(phone ringing)

919
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.533
Hi. Dad.

920
00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:02.300
Preston on phone: Meg.
Good news. we got the castle.

921
00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:04.633
Meg: Wow. that's great!
Congratulations.

922
00:37:04.767 --> 00:37:06.033
Preston:
Yeah. seeing as you're nearby.

923
00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:07.467
how 'bout popping up
and meeting me here?

924
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.000
You know German
so you can translate.

925
00:37:09.133 --> 00:37:11.467
Dad. I'm a little busy.

926
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.266
We're just about to start
the first competition round.

927
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.700
Okay. then maybe
when you're done then.

928
00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.934
Dad.
I have a job to do here.

929
00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:20.533
Are you even gonna
watch the broadcast?

930
00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:22.600
Well. I've got meetings
on top of meetings.

931
00:37:22.734 --> 00:37:24.767
but I'll try and watch it later.
I promise.

932
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.767
(ending call)

933
00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.967
(beeping)

934
00:37:31.767 --> 00:37:32.767
(sighing)

935
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.033
Uh. Henry.
I'll be right back.

936
00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:44.300
Juh-- J-- J--

937
00:37:44.433 --> 00:37:46.033
(chuckling)

938
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.367
Hey! Meg.

939
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.200
You okay?

940
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.133
Yeah. I'm fine.

941
00:37:58.266 --> 00:38:00.767
You should really
get your work station ready.

942
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.500
Oh. you know.
I have everything under control.

943
00:38:04.734 --> 00:38:06.700
What happened?

944
00:38:09.033 --> 00:38:10.667
My dad happened.

945
00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:15.834
I know he loves me
and I love him too.

946
00:38:17.867 --> 00:38:19.667
But sometimes
I just wish he would--

947
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.600
Why don't you just take
two months?

948
00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:24.100
I don't really think
that works for family.

949
00:38:24.233 --> 00:38:26.333
Ah.

950
00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:28.900
It just seems like
no matter how hard I try.

951
00:38:29.033 --> 00:38:32.533
he still sees me
as this little girl.

952
00:38:32.667 --> 00:38:34.333
running around the office
in pigtails.

953
00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:36.633
(chuckling)
Pigtails.

954
00:38:37.734 --> 00:38:39.166
I'm gonna need
to see pictures. so.

955
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.200
(laughing)
Don't make me laugh.

956
00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:42.367
I wanna be mad some more.

957
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.900
Oh. yes. of course.
I can do that too.

958
00:38:44.033 --> 00:38:45.266
Mmm.

959
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.600
I'm very-- I'm very angry.
Let's be angry together.

960
00:38:48.667 --> 00:38:50.600
Look. Look. hey. I--

961
00:38:50.734 --> 00:38:52.367
Family stuff
is complicated.

962
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.900
My dad was a great guy
and I really respected him

963
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:58.900
but I still think
that he didn't believe in me

964
00:38:59.033 --> 00:39:02.900
nearly as much as he believed
in my-- my little brother.

965
00:39:04.066 --> 00:39:06.734
You just gotta
believe in yourself.

966
00:39:06.867 --> 00:39:08.333
And what you're doing.

967
00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:10.734
Find your own confidence.

968
00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:13.433
Your own swagger.

969
00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:15.400
- Swagger.
- Mm-hm.

970
00:39:15.533 --> 00:39:17.266
- (chuckling)
- Ooh. I found it.

971
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.600
I found it.

972
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.834
(both chuckling)

973
00:39:23.033 --> 00:39:24.834
Thanks. Julian.

974
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.467
Heike on TV:

in the culinary world.

981
00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:53.934
I along with my
esteemed fellow judges

982
00:39:54.066 --> 00:39:58.567
will be determining which of
these talented culinary stars

983
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.800
will earn 250.000 euros

984
00:40:01.934 --> 00:40:06.166
and the lifelong privilege of
joining the Escoffier family.

985
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.433
The chefs will be split
into two groups of five

986
00:40:09.567 --> 00:40:11.667
and each chef
will have two hours

987
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.767
to make a classic
seafood bouillabaisse.

988
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.066
May the best chef win!

We haven't conquered
anything just yet.

1009
00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:44.567
Josh. your bouillabaisse today
was just perfect.

1010
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.900
Well done.
- Ah.

1011
00:41:46.033 --> 00:41:47.200
Julian: Oh. yes.
I'm sure it was good.

1012
00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:51.066
but what were you doing
with the vegetables?

1013
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.400
Uh. well.
I was cooking them.

1014
00:41:52.533 --> 00:41:54.066
Okay. but not in the way
that you were supposed to.

1015
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.533
You were supposed to be
chopping them.

1016
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:57.834
Instead you were
dicing them. okay?

1017
00:41:57.967 --> 00:41:58.867
The chunks were too small.

1018
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.633
I saw everything
on the livestream.

1019
00:42:00.767 --> 00:42:04.734
How 'bout you should be thanking
me instead of criticizing me?

1020
00:42:04.867 --> 00:42:06.767
Are you kidding me?

1021
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.800
This is my name
that we're talking about here.

1022
00:42:09.934 --> 00:42:11.600
and you're just
gonna go out there

1023
00:42:11.734 --> 00:42:13.100
and do whatever
you wanna do?

1024
00:42:13.233 --> 00:42:15.400
I'm sorry.
but we made a deal. okay?

1025
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:17.066
And you used to
honor deals.

1026
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.567
We used to be a team.

1027
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.367
So. I don't know what happened.
You changed.

1028
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.066
Oh. I've changed?

1029
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.433
I'm sorry.
what happened to you?

1030
00:42:23.567 --> 00:42:25.266
Suddenly. you're some socialite
on the Upper East Side

1031
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.867
who speaks with a bunch
of phony French words.

1032
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.266
You're from Alaska.
Julian. So.

1033
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.800
Nope. I'm--

1034
00:42:31.934 --> 00:42:32.800
Whoa.
what are you doing?

1035
00:42:32.934 --> 00:42:34.100
I am getting up

1036
00:42:34.233 --> 00:42:35.867
so I can storm out of this room
and slam the door.

1037
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.867
Let me save you
the trouble.

1038
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.066
- Josh.
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

1039
00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.166
(door slamming)

1040
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.233
(indistinct chatter)

1041
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.867
- Hi!
- Hi.

1042
00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.533
Is everything okay?

1043
00:42:57.667 --> 00:42:59.700
What. do I not look okay?
Did I--

1044
00:42:59.834 --> 00:43:01.166
Uh. no. You look fine.

1045
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.633
It's just. your tie
is a bit crooked here.

1046
00:43:03.767 --> 00:43:05.367
Oh.

1047
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.433
What happens when
I try and dress myself.

1048
00:43:07.567 --> 00:43:08.500
What?

1049
00:43:08.633 --> 00:43:10.033
Hm?
(chuckling)

1050
00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:12.934
No. uh.
you look incredible.

1051
00:43:13.066 --> 00:43:14.700
Well. thank you.

1052
00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:17.500
Where's Henry and this
mysterious brother of yours?

1053
00:43:17.633 --> 00:43:19.800
You know. they're in the suite
upstairs watching TV

1054
00:43:19.934 --> 00:43:23.133
and it's. uh. long story.

1055
00:43:23.266 --> 00:43:24.800
Like the story I told you
about my dad?

1056
00:43:24.934 --> 00:43:28.834
Yeah. Yeah. like I said.
family is. um...

1057
00:43:28.967 --> 00:43:30.834
it's complicated.

1058
00:43:30.967 --> 00:43:33.100
Well.
do you wanna talk about it?

1059
00:43:33.233 --> 00:43:35.433
You know. I think I might have
to take two months with them.

1060
00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:38.834
but...thank you.

1061
00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:41.934
Heike:
Ladies and gentlemen.

1062
00:43:42.066 --> 00:43:46.934
Congratulations on the first
round of the competition.

1063
00:43:47.066 --> 00:43:49.700
You're making our job
as judges very difficult.

1064
00:43:49.834 --> 00:43:51.166
(chuckling)

1065
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.100
But we can only take five of you
through to the semi-final.

1066
00:43:54.233 --> 00:43:57.433
So. without further ado.

1067
00:43:57.567 --> 00:44:02.266
the five chefs advancing
to the next round are...

1068
00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:05.233
..Etienne Leduc
from France.

1069
00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:08.266
(crowd reactions and applause)

1070
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.266
Deirdre Zidane
from Germany.

1071
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.266
(applause)

1072
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.600
Patrick O'Shea
from Ireland.

1073
00:44:14.734 --> 00:44:18.500
Angelo Perez
from the Philippines...

1074
00:44:20.734 --> 00:44:24.533
..and Julian Northrup from
the United States of America.

1075
00:44:24.667 --> 00:44:25.734
A congratulations!

1076
00:44:25.867 --> 00:44:27.433
(applause and cheers)

1077
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.934
Oh. hey!
Good morning. you two.

1078
00:44:38.367 --> 00:44:41.233
Wow. You're up early
and you look snazzy.

1079
00:44:41.367 --> 00:44:42.567
(chuckling)

1080
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.667
I thought you would've slept in
after your victory.

1081
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.266
Uh. well someone told me
that it was more important

1082
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.166
to look good
than to sleep.

1083
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.667
He said you can sleep
after the competition.

1084
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.834
(awkward chuckling)

1085
00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:53.700
Anyway. I'm gonna go
bring this up to Ju--

1086
00:44:53.834 --> 00:44:54.867
- To?
- Juh-- uh. your brother.

1087
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.200
- My brother.
- Your brother.

1088
00:44:56.333 --> 00:44:58.767
I still can't believe
I haven't met him. Can we--?

1089
00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.633
- No!
- No. no. no.

1090
00:45:00.767 --> 00:45:02.800
He's. um.
he's not a morning person.

1091
00:45:02.934 --> 00:45:04.100
- Oh. no.
- No. he's not.

1092
00:45:04.233 --> 00:45:05.400
- Henry: He's not.
- (phone ringing)

1093
00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:08.000
Oh. this is my supplier.
Excuse me one moment.

1094
00:45:08.133 --> 00:45:09.166
Liz hi!

1095
00:45:10.633 --> 00:45:12.934
- Uh. excuse me!
- Hm?

1096
00:45:13.066 --> 00:45:15.133
(scoffing)
You're getting too close to her.

1097
00:45:15.266 --> 00:45:16.600
What?
There's nothing happening.

1098
00:45:16.734 --> 00:45:18.100
What does need to happen
is we have to prepare

1099
00:45:18.233 --> 00:45:19.734
for the Black Diamond
truffle round. all right?

1100
00:45:19.867 --> 00:45:21.300
(sighing)

1101
00:45:21.433 --> 00:45:22.834
- That's it.
- Okay. All right.

1102
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.467
Hey. Oh. you look
like you've seen a ghost.

1103
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.166
The truffles. They still haven't
shipped from France.

1104
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.800
Okay. well. we'll get
some more. That's okay.

1105
00:45:34.934 --> 00:45:37.934
No! No. it's a disaster.
You know how rare they are.

1106
00:45:38.066 --> 00:45:40.967
I certainly do. yeah.

1107
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.967
I'm gonna get fired
for sure.

1108
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.400
Wait. wait. wait. Actually...
I think I can help.

1109
00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:51.633
I'm delighted
you thought of me.

1110
00:45:51.767 --> 00:45:53.066
Perhaps this will score me
an invitation

1111
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.900
to the Escoffier events.

1112
00:45:55.033 --> 00:45:57.667
I know. uh.
Heike won't like that.

1113
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.567
Chester. you do this for me.
you can come to every party.

1114
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.567
every competition round.
every-- everything.

1115
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.633
You can live at the hotel!

1116
00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:06.333
Deal.

1117
00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:07.834
So. that's our man.

1118
00:46:07.967 --> 00:46:09.700
If he has any
Black Diamond truffles.

1119
00:46:09.834 --> 00:46:11.033
he'll have them hidden.

1120
00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:13.533
And he's very particular
about who he sells them to.

1121
00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:15.400
He doesn't deem you
worthy enough.

1122
00:46:15.533 --> 00:46:17.133
he'll send you away
empty-handed.

1123
00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:18.900
Whatever you can do. Chester.
we-- we. I mean.

1124
00:46:19.033 --> 00:46:20.166
we truly appreciate it.
- Yeah.

1125
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.567
Anything for
my dear friend Julian.

1126
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.734
So. go and amuse yourself
in the market.

1127
00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:28.166
If he sees you watching.
it'll spook him.

1128
00:46:29.467 --> 00:46:31.000
- Right.
- Right. Let's do this.

1129
00:46:31.133 --> 00:46:32.200
Where are you going?

1130
00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:33.567
I'm popping into the village

1131
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.500
to do a bit of shopping
before your brother gets back.

1132
00:46:35.633 --> 00:46:37.567
Ooh. great.
I'm gonna get my Josh costume.

1133
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.834
No. no. no. wait. wait.
It's too risky.

1134
00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:41.567
Especially now that we're in
the semi-finals.

1135
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.300
I mean.
we can't take any chances.

1136
00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:45.000
Eyes on the prize.

1137
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.467
- Thank you.
- Thank you. You know what?

1138
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.834
Mm?

1139
00:46:57.967 --> 00:46:59.533
Mmm!

1140
00:46:59.667 --> 00:47:01.033
That's delicious.

1141
00:47:01.166 --> 00:47:03.600
Produce is always the best
when it is farmed fresh.

1142
00:47:03.734 --> 00:47:04.867
Okay. next question.

1143
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.033
What is your favorite meal.
besides chocolate?

1144
00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:09.567
Take-out.

1145
00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.633
What?
That-- that doesn't count!

1146
00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:15.367
(chuckling) I don't know!
To me. food. it's-- just food.

1147
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.367
- Oh. no. no. no.
- It's fuel.

1148
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.300
I know it's ironic.
considering my job.

1149
00:47:19.433 --> 00:47:20.767
There must be
something you like.

1150
00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.133
You're going to
sneer at me.

1151
00:47:24.266 --> 00:47:26.100
I don't think it's up to
Julian Northrup's standards.

1152
00:47:26.233 --> 00:47:30.033
I mean. maybe not. but I will
not ever "sneer" at you.

1153
00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:31.600
(chuckling)

1154
00:47:31.734 --> 00:47:36.133
There is nothing better
than a really good cheeseburger.

1155
00:47:36.266 --> 00:47:38.734
- Ah!
- It's not fancy. I know.

1156
00:47:38.867 --> 00:47:41.734
Well. that's interesting.
Why cheeseburgers?

1157
00:47:41.867 --> 00:47:43.900
- It's comfort food.
- Mm.

1158
00:47:44.033 --> 00:47:47.633
My mom passed away
when I was a little girl.

1159
00:47:47.767 --> 00:47:52.567
and my dad was not exactly
equipped to raise me.

1160
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.900
so whenever he thought
I was sad or...

1161
00:47:57.033 --> 00:47:57.934
unhappy.

1162
00:47:58.066 --> 00:47:59.900
had a bad day at school.

1163
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.767
we'd go for cheeseburgers.
- (chuckling)

1164
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.100
That's amazing.
You see. food is more than fuel.

1165
00:48:06.233 --> 00:48:08.200
It's what brought
your family together.

1166
00:48:10.433 --> 00:48:12.200
I don't know. It's just another
way to say "I love you".

1167
00:48:18.467 --> 00:48:20.300
(grunting)

1168
00:48:20.433 --> 00:48:21.433
Oooh.

1169
00:48:24.266 --> 00:48:25.333
You must be the brother?

1170
00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:27.667
Etienne. what do you--
what are you doing here?

1171
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.533
How do you know who I am?

1172
00:48:30.667 --> 00:48:33.200
From the-- uh. 'cause
the competition on the TV.

1173
00:48:33.333 --> 00:48:34.867
Yeah. I'm Josh.

1174
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.967
I'm-- I'm Julian's brother.
I'm Josh.

1175
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.133
I figured. 'cause Julian
wouldn't be caught dead

1176
00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:40.300
in that hat.

1177
00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:42.767
You don't know who--
You wouldn't know that.

1178
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.200
Julian and I are old friends.
I know him very well.

1179
00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:47.266
Dude. no. you don't.

1180
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.633
How would you know that?

1181
00:48:49.767 --> 00:48:51.200
Because. we are very close.

1182
00:48:51.333 --> 00:48:54.100
He once told me that
you have nothing in common.

1183
00:48:54.233 --> 00:48:56.100
We have a lot in common.

1184
00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:58.166
Such as?

1185
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.767
Such as. we-- both--

1186
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.734
cook.

1187
00:49:02.867 --> 00:49:04.000
(laughing)

1188
00:49:04.133 --> 00:49:06.433
Ah. you were in a diner.

1189
00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:09.500
in Alaska?
(laughing)

1190
00:49:09.633 --> 00:49:10.667
Yes. I do. Do you have--

1191
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.934
Is there something wrong
with that?

1192
00:49:12.066 --> 00:49:14.367
Ah. the Julian Northrup
I know

1193
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.867
would find a lot
wrong with that.

1194
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Then clearly.
you don't him very well

1195
00:49:19.133 --> 00:49:21.233
because Julian
is very supportive of me.

1196
00:49:21.367 --> 00:49:23.233
Yeah.

1197
00:49:23.367 --> 00:49:26.433
Does he think I could be doing
a lot more with my talent? Sure.

1198
00:49:26.567 --> 00:49:29.200
Does he want me to experience
the culinary arts

1199
00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:31.000
in a way that I simply can't
in a diner in Alaska?

1200
00:49:31.133 --> 00:49:32.266
Of course. but. um--

1201
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.700
So. he supports you

1202
00:49:33.834 --> 00:49:36.133
but wants you to change
everything to be more like him?

1203
00:49:40.033 --> 00:49:40.934
I--

1204
00:49:41.066 --> 00:49:42.934
(chuckling)

1205
00:49:43.066 --> 00:49:45.600
Did you-- you haven't
talked to Julian about this.

1206
00:49:45.734 --> 00:49:46.600
No.

1207
00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:48.767
Uh. he's been avoiding me. so.

1208
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.800
Aha. Smart man.

1209
00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.200
What's your favorite meal?

1210
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:00.934
Uh. okay.
Well. that's easy.

1211
00:50:01.066 --> 00:50:04.000
Not a meal but my favorite dish
is baked Alaska.

1212
00:50:04.133 --> 00:50:05.400
- Ooh.
- Yeah. my mom used to make it

1213
00:50:05.533 --> 00:50:06.934
on special occasions
all the time.

1214
00:50:07.066 --> 00:50:10.767
Birthdays. holidays. whenever
one of us got an A in school.

1215
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.333
(chuckling)

1216
00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:16.066
Yeah. baked Alaska always meant
something good had happened. so.

1217
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.667
Used to be
my brother's favorite too.

1218
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.033
Maybe that's why
you both like to cook.

1219
00:50:23.734 --> 00:50:26.533
(chuckling) You know what?
I think you might be right.

1220
00:50:26.667 --> 00:50:28.867
Well.
it's like what you said.

1221
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.333
As long as you're
doing something

1222
00:50:30.467 --> 00:50:32.533
that makes people happy.

1223
00:50:32.667 --> 00:50:34.867
what could be better
than that?

1224
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.767
What?

1225
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.500
- Are those--
- They are.

1226
00:50:39.633 --> 00:50:41.667
(laughing)

1227
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.166
Oh my gosh. thank you!

1228
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.533
- You're very welcome. my dear.
- So much!

1229
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:46.266
(giggling)

1230
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.166
And thank you.
You saved me.

1231
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.500
Muah.

1232
00:50:53.734 --> 00:50:56.000
All right. let's. um.
let's get cookin'.

1233
00:50:56.133 --> 00:50:58.500
Henry:
Practice went well today.

1234
00:50:58.633 --> 00:51:01.133
Josh: I don't know
if Julian thought so.

1235
00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:03.100
He is just so
- I know.

1236
00:51:03.233 --> 00:51:04.333
- Gah!
- Oh. I know.

1237
00:51:04.467 --> 00:51:06.000
- I don't know.
- (awkward chuckling)

1238
00:51:06.133 --> 00:51:08.800
I know. but you can't--
you can't blame him. can you?

1239
00:51:08.934 --> 00:51:11.767
He's just trying to prove that
he can compete at that level.

1240
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.066
He's trying to save
the restaurant.

1241
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.333
He's trying
to impress you. Josh.

1242
00:51:15.467 --> 00:51:16.734
- He's trying to impress me?
- Yes!

1243
00:51:16.867 --> 00:51:19.000
- (laughing) No! No. no.
- Yes. he is.

1244
00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:21.400
He might be
the slightly older brother.

1245
00:51:21.533 --> 00:51:24.500
but he looks up to you.

1246
00:51:24.633 --> 00:51:26.500
Okay.
if that were actually true.

1247
00:51:26.633 --> 00:51:28.734
then I don't know why
he just doesn't trust me.

1248
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.600
Scared.
Scared of losing control.

1249
00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:34.600
I mean. he yelled at me

1250
00:51:34.734 --> 00:51:36.333
for grinding
the peppercorns too hard.

1251
00:51:36.467 --> 00:51:38.433
I mean. come on! He's not gonna
let me control anything.

1252
00:51:39.734 --> 00:51:41.100
(sighing)

1253
00:51:41.233 --> 00:51:44.367
Maybe you should control
your feelings towards Meg. Josh.

1254
00:51:46.066 --> 00:51:47.400
We're not gonna
do this again.

1255
00:51:47.533 --> 00:51:50.967
Can you honestly say that
there's nothing between you two?

1256
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.100
It doesn't matter.
I'm not stupid.

1257
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.900
Josh. you know that you can
never tell her the truth.

1258
00:51:58.033 --> 00:52:02.066
Even after the competition.
when we win or lose.

1259
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.967
you can't.
'cause it'll destroy Julian.

1260
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.767
You know that. don't you?

1261
00:52:10.967 --> 00:52:12.600
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1262
00:52:18.767 --> 00:52:19.767
Hey!

1263
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.367
Hi.

1264
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.400
I didn't-- I didn't know
anyone was gonna be here.

1265
00:52:24.533 --> 00:52:26.500
Uh. yeah.
Just wanted to make sure

1266
00:52:26.633 --> 00:52:28.300
I have everything
for tomorrow.

1267
00:52:28.433 --> 00:52:30.233
You know. crossing my T's.
dotting my I's.

1268
00:52:30.367 --> 00:52:31.467
Yeah.

1269
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.734
I was actually gonna do
the same sort of thing

1270
00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:35.934
with my work station.
Just--

1271
00:52:38.867 --> 00:52:40.200
Yeah. you know what?

1272
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:43.633
This is all stuff I can
probably do in the morning. so.

1273
00:52:45.166 --> 00:52:46.900
I should probably
go get some sleep.

1274
00:52:47.033 --> 00:52:48.200
(chuckling)

1275
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:50.800
Yeah. me too.

1276
00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.800
Well. goodnight.

1277
00:52:52.934 --> 00:52:54.233
Goodnight!

1278
00:52:55.367 --> 00:52:56.467
Hey. are you hungry?

1279
00:52:57.667 --> 00:52:59.367
Ah!

1280
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.533
I thought
you would never ask.

1281
00:53:00.667 --> 00:53:02.467
(chuckling)

1282
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.200
I should take over
for the semi-finals.

1283
00:53:04.333 --> 00:53:05.467
You haven't got
a wristband.

1284
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.100
Yeah. but there's gotta be
some way around that.

1285
00:53:07.233 --> 00:53:08.100
There isn't.

1286
00:53:08.233 --> 00:53:09.266
And if you lose it
or you break it.

1287
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.633
then you're out
of the competition

1288
00:53:10.767 --> 00:53:12.734
and we lose everything.
Julian.

1289
00:53:12.867 --> 00:53:14.033
you need to trust Josh.

1290
00:53:14.166 --> 00:53:15.600
I do. I do.

1291
00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:17.066
(quietly)
He doesn't think so.

1292
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.567
Wait. he said that?

1293
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.133
Yeah.

1294
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.633
(Josh laughing)
That's so--

1295
00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.100
I thought you were
gonna cook for me.

1296
00:53:26.233 --> 00:53:28.900
You know.
teach a man to fish!

1297
00:53:29.033 --> 00:53:30.567
- Am I doing this right?
- Okay. okay. okay.

1298
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.800
Listen. listen.
Don't be afraid of it. okay?

1299
00:53:32.934 --> 00:53:34.300
- Okay.
- Bring it back.

1300
00:53:34.433 --> 00:53:37.567
The secret to good cooking
is to get your hands dirty.

1301
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.567
Okay.

1302
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.467
Josh:
Rawr! Rawr!

1303
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.266
Generally we don't wear blazers
when we cook. but.

1304
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.700
(laughing)
Yeah. I was gonna say!

1305
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:46.433
If your blazer gets a little
dirty. I'm so very sorry.

1306
00:53:46.567 --> 00:53:47.633
I'll pay for
the dry cleaning bill.

1307
00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:50.133
- (laughing)
- Come on!

1308
00:53:50.266 --> 00:53:52.166
I think it's gonna work.

1309
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.500
So um.
tell me about Henry.

1310
00:53:58.834 --> 00:54:01.700
What was your wedding like?
Was Josh your best man?

1311
00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:05.633
He-- Josh was.

1312
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.934
Indeed. my wedding was just--
was beautiful.

1313
00:54:11.066 --> 00:54:14.367
Yeah. it was just a few
family and friends.

1314
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.333
a small wedding. Um--

1315
00:54:16.467 --> 00:54:18.500
- That's nice.
- Yeah!

1316
00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:21.100
- Is that a bun?
- Okay. good.

1317
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.133
Mm!
- Mmm! Mm-hm!

1318
00:54:25.266 --> 00:54:28.100
- Mm-hm?
- (chuckling)

1319
00:54:28.233 --> 00:54:32.967
You know. I might just have to
enter the Escoffier next year.

1320
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.500
I mean.
I could be your sous chef.

1321
00:54:34.633 --> 00:54:36.100
(chuckling)

1322
00:54:36.233 --> 00:54:39.000
Or maybe I take my talents to
the restaurant world.

1323
00:54:39.133 --> 00:54:40.133
- Mmm!
- You know?

1324
00:54:40.266 --> 00:54:42.800
Special. unique events.
special themes.

1325
00:54:42.934 --> 00:54:44.800
Yeah. you should do that
for J Northrup.

1326
00:54:44.934 --> 00:54:47.433
Wait. really?

1327
00:54:47.567 --> 00:54:48.967
You'd be interested
in that?

1328
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.300
Uh--

1329
00:54:50.433 --> 00:54:52.266
I mean.
working together?

1330
00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.333
Uh--
(clearing throat) Sorry.

1331
00:54:55.467 --> 00:54:57.934
I mean. it's something that
we would have to think about.

1332
00:54:58.066 --> 00:54:59.533
I mean.
I have to talk to Henry

1333
00:54:59.667 --> 00:55:01.200
'cause he makes all
of the business decisions.

1334
00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:02.233
Oh. yeah.

1335
00:55:02.367 --> 00:55:03.867
Yeah. yeah. no. of course.
Of course.

1336
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.066
I mean. we wouldn't wanna get
too far ahead of ourselves.

1337
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.767
Right. right. I mean. we need to
be focusing on the competition.

1338
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.767
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

1339
00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.567
Well. cheers to that.

1340
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.133
- Well.
- (both chuckling)

1341
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:22.533
(knocking at door)

1342
00:55:25.033 --> 00:55:25.934
Good morning!

1343
00:55:26.066 --> 00:55:28.467
Hello. hi. yes.
Good morning.

1344
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.567
I'm really sorry
to bother you.

1345
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.133
I know I probably
could've waited

1346
00:55:31.266 --> 00:55:34.367
until you came downstairs.
but I just...

1347
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.100
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

1348
00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:39.200
Uh. last night.

1349
00:55:39.333 --> 00:55:41.600
(stammering)
What happened last night?

1350
00:55:41.734 --> 00:55:43.066
Well. you know.

1351
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.367
Mm?

1352
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.734
The thing you said
about working

1353
00:55:46.867 --> 00:55:49.200
at events together at J Northrup
after the competition?

1354
00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:52.633
I-- I got all eager
about it and--

1355
00:55:52.767 --> 00:55:54.467
we've only known each other
a couple days.

1356
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.033
and I work at l'Élite

1357
00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.767
and I didn't want you to think
I was taking advantage of that.

1358
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.934
Yeah. I think that if I
suggested that we work together

1359
00:56:03.066 --> 00:56:06.834
at my restaurant it was probably
a little premature at best.

1360
00:56:06.967 --> 00:56:09.433
- Right.
- Yeah.

1361
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.633
Okay. yeah.
Let's just forget it.

1362
00:56:12.767 --> 00:56:14.333
Mm-hm.

1363
00:56:14.467 --> 00:56:15.867
Do we need
to take two months?

1364
00:56:17.767 --> 00:56:19.266
Are we cool?

1365
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.800
Yeah. Oh. yes.
Yes. we're fine.

1366
00:56:21.934 --> 00:56:23.300
Great.

1367
00:56:23.433 --> 00:56:24.800
Mm-hm.

1368
00:56:24.934 --> 00:56:25.834
Okay. well.
good luck today.

1369
00:56:25.967 --> 00:56:27.266
Okay!

1370
00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.000
Whoa.

1371
00:56:35.133 --> 00:56:36.300
How'd you get down here
so fast?

1372
00:56:36.433 --> 00:56:38.133
I was literally just up
in your room a second ago

1373
00:56:38.266 --> 00:56:39.233
and you're already here?

1374
00:56:40.667 --> 00:56:42.433
- Julian?
- Hm?

1375
00:56:42.567 --> 00:56:45.533
Do you wanna come and join me
at the-- the station. please?

1376
00:56:45.667 --> 00:56:47.867
Yes. Yeah. um. sorry.
Just--

1377
00:56:50.734 --> 00:56:51.600
You know--

1378
00:56:51.734 --> 00:56:53.500
Uh. sorry.
this isn't working.

1379
00:56:53.633 --> 00:56:55.633
Wait. let me see.

1380
00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.000
That's so weird.

1381
00:56:58.133 --> 00:56:59.633
It's like there's no power.

1382
00:56:59.767 --> 00:57:01.000
Well.
let me check the--

1383
00:57:01.133 --> 00:57:02.233
Both:
Ogh!

1384
00:57:02.367 --> 00:57:03.533
God!

1385
00:57:03.667 --> 00:57:05.233
Woof!
- Oof.

1386
00:57:05.367 --> 00:57:07.100
That's warm. This is warm.
- It's ruined.

1387
00:57:07.233 --> 00:57:08.333
Well. I don't understand.

1388
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:09.633
I don't know
how this could happen.

1389
00:57:13.633 --> 00:57:14.734
Whoa. hey.

1390
00:57:14.867 --> 00:57:15.900
It's all right.
it's all right.

1391
00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:17.233
We have an hour
until the semi-finals.

1392
00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:19.000
What are we gonna do?

1393
00:57:22.333 --> 00:57:23.500
Are you sure
you should be helping me?

1394
00:57:23.633 --> 00:57:25.667
We're supposed to be
supplying our own food.

1395
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.200
You know. I should be
going to the market.

1396
00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:29.100
No. the competition starts
in 42 minutes.

1397
00:57:29.233 --> 00:57:31.600
You're not gonna
make it there in time.

1398
00:57:31.734 --> 00:57:34.767
Besides. you helped me with
the truffles. so I owe you.

1399
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.333
The question is. is there
anything here that you can use?

1400
00:57:37.467 --> 00:57:39.066
I don't know.
tell me what you see.

1401
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.834
A rack of lamb

1402
00:57:40.967 --> 00:57:42.233
Yeah. that's gonna take
too long to cook.

1403
00:57:42.367 --> 00:57:44.266
Oh. this looks
like swordfish.

1404
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.367
- Does that go with truffles?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1405
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.233
I don't know. I just--
(sighing)

1406
00:57:48.367 --> 00:57:49.567
I don't know what to do!

1407
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.900
Okay. hey.
Hey. look at me.

1408
00:57:51.033 --> 00:57:53.000
Breathe.
- (sighing)

1409
00:57:53.133 --> 00:57:55.233
Confidence and swagger.
right?

1410
00:57:55.367 --> 00:57:56.233
Yeah.

1411
00:57:56.367 --> 00:57:57.533
Besides. this is
what you love to do.

1412
00:57:57.667 --> 00:58:00.400
Being creative. experimenting.
trying new dishes.

1413
00:58:00.533 --> 00:58:02.166
Yep. thank you.
You're right.

1414
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:03.767
Okay. well I've got
some fresh pressed juices.

1415
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.767
Okay.

1416
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.633
What about
a truffle smoothie?

1417
00:58:06.767 --> 00:58:08.266
(chuckling)

1418
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.934
Okay. that's pushing the limits
even a little bit.

1419
00:58:10.066 --> 00:58:11.133
No. come on!

1420
00:58:11.266 --> 00:58:12.633
We could do a whole breakfast
theme. you know?

1421
00:58:12.767 --> 00:58:15.800
Truffle smoothies. truffle
pancakes. truffle syrup?

1422
00:58:15.934 --> 00:58:17.100
Truffle cream of wheat.

1423
00:58:17.233 --> 00:58:18.800
Truffle donuts.

1424
00:58:18.934 --> 00:58:20.266
No. no! Stop!

1425
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.367
(chuckling)

1426
00:58:22.767 --> 00:58:25.467
Well. I mean.
there's pancetta?

1427
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.333
Isn't this
just like fancy bacon?

1428
00:58:27.467 --> 00:58:29.667
Yeah. we could go
with truffle pancakes.

1429
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.900
(chuckling)

1430
00:58:31.033 --> 00:58:32.800
Mmm. Is it weird
that I could eat this

1431
00:58:32.934 --> 00:58:34.633
straight out
of the Saran wrap?

1432
00:58:34.767 --> 00:58:37.533
Everything is better
with bacon.

1433
00:58:39.367 --> 00:58:41.400
Wait a second.
Wait. wait a second.

1434
00:58:41.533 --> 00:58:42.600
Wagyu tenderloin.

1435
00:58:42.734 --> 00:58:44.633
This is some of the best beef
in the world.

1436
00:58:44.767 --> 00:58:46.633
Do we have cheese?
- Oh yeah. there's a lot of it.

1437
00:58:46.767 --> 00:58:47.967
Ooh.

1438
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.600
(whispering)
I have an idea.

1439
00:58:56.133 --> 00:58:57.166
And what we have here?

1440
00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.233
Here we have
milk-braised pork shoulder

1441
00:59:00.367 --> 00:59:02.700
with Black Diamond
truffle shavings.

1442
00:59:02.834 --> 00:59:07.633
haricot vert that has been
sautéed in a Burgundy reduction.

1443
00:59:07.767 --> 00:59:09.867
grilled portabella mushrooms

1444
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.834
that have been brined
in a truffle sea salt.

1445
00:59:12.967 --> 00:59:14.300
Bon appétit!

1446
00:59:14.433 --> 00:59:20.767
♪

1447
00:59:28.433 --> 00:59:30.000
Heike on TV:
Interesting.

1448
00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.867
Chef Northrup. explain.

1449
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.700
Uh. well I wanted to show
that the right ingredients

1450
00:59:34.834 --> 00:59:37.033
can elevate even the simplest.
most basic meals.

1451
00:59:37.166 --> 00:59:41.200
So. we have a patty of ground
Wagyu beef with truffles.

1452
00:59:41.333 --> 00:59:42.867
four different kinds
of cheeses.

1453
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.166
pancetta cooked with
a black pepper truffle sauce.

1454
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:48.500
and French fries
in garlic and truffle oil.

1455
00:59:48.633 --> 00:59:49.900
Judges.

1456
00:59:50.033 --> 00:59:51.734
may I present

1457
00:59:51.867 --> 00:59:55.433
the Black Diamond truffle
bacon cheeseburger.

1458
01:00:02.467 --> 01:00:05.467
And so. the three chefs that
will be advancing to the final

1459
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.000
day after tomorrow

1460
01:00:07.133 --> 01:00:10.200
are Etienne LeDuc from France...

1461
01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:13.333
(applause)

1462
01:00:13.467 --> 01:00:17.300
..Deirdre Zidane from Germany...

1463
01:00:17.433 --> 01:00:19.600
(applause)

1464
01:00:23.633 --> 01:00:26.633
..and Julian Northrup from
the United States of America.

1465
01:00:26.767 --> 01:00:27.900
Yes!

1466
01:00:30.166 --> 01:00:32.200
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

1467
01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:34.967
We did it. Okay. I'm gonna go
and tell Julian.

1468
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

1469
01:00:41.266 --> 01:00:43.533
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

1470
01:00:43.667 --> 01:00:46.000
I couldn't have done it without
a little help from my friends.

1471
01:00:48.934 --> 01:00:50.934
Dad. I--

1472
01:00:52.433 --> 01:00:53.400
What are you doing here?

1473
01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:55.233
Well. I needed a break

1474
01:00:55.367 --> 01:00:56.967
from signing all those papers
for the castle deal.

1475
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.300
so I thought I'd pop over
and see how you were doing.

1476
01:00:59.433 --> 01:01:01.100
You came to see my event?

1477
01:01:01.233 --> 01:01:02.367
(chuckling)

1478
01:01:03.767 --> 01:01:05.700
Dad. you remember
Julian Northrup?

1479
01:01:05.834 --> 01:01:07.467
He's one of our finalists.

1480
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.800
Yes. of course.

1481
01:01:08.934 --> 01:01:10.633
We met the other day
at your restaurant in New York.

1482
01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.033
Ah yes. we did.

1483
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.467
That meal was fantastic.

1484
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.767
Meg. this guy knows
what he's doing in the kitchen.

1485
01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.967
Oh. he certainly does.
(chuckling)

1486
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.633
Well. I'd better go
get checked in.

1487
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.867
Aw. the little girl
in pigtails is happy.

1488
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.300
Yeah. She is.

1489
01:01:29.433 --> 01:01:31.200
(chuckling)

1490
01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:32.633
(mouthing words)

1491
01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:34.800
Um--

1492
01:01:34.934 --> 01:01:37.467
Actually. I'm gonna just catch
up with you a little bit later.

1493
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.266
Oh. yeah. I mean.
I should probably go make sure

1494
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.734
my dad's not telling
the front desk

1495
01:01:41.867 --> 01:01:43.400
any embarrassing stories
from my childhood.

1496
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.467
- (chuckling)
- Yeah. you should. Right?

1497
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.834
- Bye.
- Okay.

1498
01:01:50.834 --> 01:01:52.266
(loud whispering)
What are you doing here?

1499
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.633
I have been trying
to talk to you all day!

1500
01:01:54.767 --> 01:01:57.066
Yeah. well I'm busy trying
to win you this competition.

1501
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.367
Yeah. about that. I. um.
I think that I should probably

1502
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.667
take over
for the final round.

1503
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.700
What?
You don't have the wristband.

1504
01:02:03.834 --> 01:02:05.300
Yeah. just tell your girlfriend
that you lost it

1505
01:02:05.433 --> 01:02:06.800
or you set it on fire
or something.

1506
01:02:06.934 --> 01:02:07.934
She's not my girlfriend.

1507
01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:09.367
Oh. really?

1508
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.333
Because I thought that since
you offered up my restaurant

1509
01:02:11.467 --> 01:02:12.800
for her to do
her little events

1510
01:02:12.934 --> 01:02:14.133
that you guys were
more than just pals.

1511
01:02:14.266 --> 01:02:15.133
Okay. yes. I'm sorry.

1512
01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:16.400
I slipped up
but I walked it back!

1513
01:02:18.233 --> 01:02:20.667
Okay. Julian.

1514
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.867
I am trying to help you.

1515
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.533
Yeah. well.
I don't need your help.

1516
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.200
I really think
that I can win this thing.

1517
01:02:36.133 --> 01:02:38.100
Okay. Fine.

1518
01:02:38.233 --> 01:02:39.834
Fine. but you're gonna
have to remember

1519
01:02:39.967 --> 01:02:42.800
that it's gonna say
Julian Northrup

1520
01:02:42.934 --> 01:02:45.800
on that trophy. not Josh.

1521
01:02:45.934 --> 01:02:48.500
Josh: Yes.
I am painfully aware of that.

1522
01:02:48.633 --> 01:02:51.667
And you'll stay away
from Meg.

1523
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.033
Josh. promise me that you will
stay away from that girl.

1524
01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:57.467
Okay. I promise. Julian.

1525
01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:01.033
Get outta here.

1526
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.433
Fine. you--

1527
01:03:14.467 --> 01:03:16.734
Miss Westcott!

1528
01:03:16.867 --> 01:03:20.166
Have you noticed anything off
about Chef Northrup?

1529
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.967
Off? What do you mean?

1530
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.266
You and him seem close.

1531
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.467
Perhaps you already know
what I mean.

1532
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.333
I promise I don't.

1533
01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:29.934
Well. I have some important
information I have to share.

1534
01:03:30.066 --> 01:03:32.333
Julian Northrup is not
who he says he is.

1535
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.734
Chef Leduc. I understand
that you wanna win.

1536
01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:39.467
but sabotaging one of your
main competitors is beneath you.

1537
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.500
don't you think?

1538
01:03:40.633 --> 01:03:42.633
Sabotage? No!

1539
01:03:42.767 --> 01:03:44.600
I am talking about the integrity
of the Escoffier.

1540
01:03:44.734 --> 01:03:48.467
Etienne.
I know I can't prove it.

1541
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.433
but I suspect you were the one
behind the power failure

1542
01:03:50.567 --> 01:03:52.834
at Julian's work station.

1543
01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:56.266
so perhaps integrity is not
the card I would be playing

1544
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.266
if I were you.

1545
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.100
Have a good day. Chef Leduc.

1546
01:04:02.533 --> 01:04:04.433
(stammering)

1547
01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:14.300
Done.

1548
01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.700
Okay. Looks good.
Let's do it again.

1549
01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:21.900
It's peaches. ice cream.
and raspberry sauce.

1550
01:04:22.033 --> 01:04:23.900
Julian.
it's not rocket science.

1551
01:04:24.033 --> 01:04:25.367
It's traditional.

1552
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.533
Etienne and Deirdre are gonna be
pulling out all the stops

1553
01:04:27.667 --> 01:04:28.834
with their interpretations.

1554
01:04:28.967 --> 01:04:30.967
They're gonna be bold.
they're gonna take risks.

1555
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.233
We should do the same.

1556
01:04:32.367 --> 01:04:35.333
Josh. I practically had to
pry you away from Alaska

1557
01:04:35.467 --> 01:04:38.033
because of this whole
respect for tradition thing.

1558
01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:39.367
Okay? You don't do bold.

1559
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.567
Well. you know what?
Things change. okay?

1560
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.667
Oh. and when I'm finally able
to buy the place back.

1561
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.200
I am gonna do whatever I want
with the food I cook.

1562
01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:50.834
Well. great. Do that. But now
we're gonna do things my way.

1563
01:04:58.166 --> 01:05:00.600
Meg.
I've been looking for you.

1564
01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:02.233
- Hi.
- They're having a banquet

1565
01:05:02.367 --> 01:05:04.266
at the castle in Germany tonight
for the local officials.

1566
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.934
I have to go shake hands
and calm nerves.

1567
01:05:07.066 --> 01:05:09.533
But the final round
of competitions is tomorrow.

1568
01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:12.266
I was hoping you'd be here
to see it.

1569
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.133
Well. I can't.
This is important business.

1570
01:05:14.266 --> 01:05:16.133
Dad.
this is important to me.

1571
01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:19.900
Dad. this is what I wanna do
with my life.

1572
01:05:20.033 --> 01:05:21.100
Look around.

1573
01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:23.967
I did this. I planned it.
I organized it.

1574
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.767
I'm running it. Me!

1575
01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:30.567
And I'm proud of myself and
people here are proud of me too.

1576
01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.367
Julian keeps saying that--
- Julian?

1577
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.033
The chef from New York?

1578
01:05:34.166 --> 01:05:36.867
Yes. He's appreciating
what I'm doing here.

1579
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.800
I don't think you should get
too wrapped up in his opinion.

1580
01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.900
You know his restaurant
is going under. right?

1581
01:05:41.934 --> 01:05:44.533
What?
How do you know that?

1582
01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.266
The reason I suggested
lunch there last week

1583
01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.900
is because I'm looking
at buying the building.

1584
01:05:48.033 --> 01:05:49.066
I think I can get
a really good deal

1585
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.233
once J Northrup goes under.

1586
01:05:52.367 --> 01:05:54.033
He didn't mention that.

1587
01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:55.367
Well. maybe
he doesn't appreciate you

1588
01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.734
as much as
you thought he did.

1589
01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:00.800
Dad. why are you even here?

1590
01:06:00.934 --> 01:06:02.767
Because this is
obviously important to you

1591
01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.300
and I wanted to see it
for myself.

1592
01:06:04.433 --> 01:06:05.467
I wanted to see
what's keeping you

1593
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.200
from being part
of the family empire.

1594
01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:09.266
I wanna build
my own empire.

1595
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.266
Then do it.

1596
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.600
I'll give you
whatever you need.

1597
01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:12.767
Start-up capital.
office space.

1598
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.166
No. no! Listen!

1599
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.033
I want to do this
on my own.

1600
01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:18.800
You're a Westcott.

1601
01:06:18.934 --> 01:06:20.233
You can do
important things.

1602
01:06:22.967 --> 01:06:24.867
Well. have a safe flight.

1603
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.066
Enjoy Germany.
enjoy your castle.

1604
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.166
Miss Mueller.
we have to talk.

1605
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.400
(birds chirping)

1606
01:06:39.767 --> 01:06:41.200
No. no.
stay away from her. Josh.

1607
01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:43.200
I-- Ugh.
What am I doing?

1608
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.767
Hey. are you okay?

1609
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.667
Mostly.

1610
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.033
You?

1611
01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:50.500
Uh. yeah. Me. I'm fine.
C'est magnifique.

1612
01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:52.767
Heh-heh.
Mostly magnifique.

1613
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.533
But you first.

1614
01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:57.633
Turns out
my dad showing up here

1615
01:06:57.767 --> 01:07:00.533
wasn't the supportive gesture
I was hoping it would be.

1616
01:07:00.667 --> 01:07:02.600
Oh. I'm sorry.

1617
01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:06.033
Your turn.

1618
01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:09.667
Um. I am not really sure

1619
01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.500
what I'm doing
for the finals.

1620
01:07:11.633 --> 01:07:14.567
Or maybe what I'm doing
in general.

1621
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.667
(chuckling)

1622
01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.834
Sounds like we both
lost our swagger.

1623
01:07:19.967 --> 01:07:22.567
Ha-ha. Yeah. I guess so.

1624
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.500
I mean. I had all these
big plans. you know?

1625
01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:28.900
I was gonna make my kitchen
into something special.

1626
01:07:29.033 --> 01:07:30.367
Make it a world
where I could just take

1627
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.600
whatever kind of risks
I wanted and then--

1628
01:07:33.734 --> 01:07:35.166
it just never really
worked out.

1629
01:07:36.734 --> 01:07:38.367
So. if J Northrup
isn't what you want it to be.

1630
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.000
why not change it?

1631
01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:44.066
Yeah. that's-- you know.
it's not that easy.

1632
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.600
I mean. sure it is.

1633
01:07:45.734 --> 01:07:47.867
I already have so many ideas
what I could do with that place.

1634
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.033
- Hmm.
- Add some warm colors.

1635
01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.700
some lights.
maybe candles. flowers.

1636
01:07:52.834 --> 01:07:54.667
make it a little bit
more romantic.

1637
01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:59.500
Sorry. there I go. taking over
your restaurant again.

1638
01:07:59.633 --> 01:08:01.100
It's the event planner
in me.

1639
01:08:01.233 --> 01:08:02.600
No. it's okay.

1640
01:08:02.734 --> 01:08:04.633
Seems nice. actually.

1641
01:08:04.767 --> 01:08:05.734
(chuckling)

1642
01:08:05.867 --> 01:08:10.066
Um. it's just--
you know. being here

1643
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.300
and all the encouragement
that I've been getting from...

1644
01:08:13.433 --> 01:08:16.300
everyone...

1645
01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:17.734
I think I'm actually
starting to believe

1646
01:08:17.867 --> 01:08:20.233
that I could do anything.

1647
01:08:20.367 --> 01:08:23.633
I feel the exact same way.

1648
01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.066
I could've had my own
event planning company by now.

1649
01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.500
but I don't think
I was ready.

1650
01:08:28.633 --> 01:08:29.934
After meeting
everybody here

1651
01:08:30.066 --> 01:08:33.333
and knowing that they think
I'm doing a good job--

1652
01:08:33.467 --> 01:08:35.066
A great job.

1653
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.233
It's because I have
people like you in my corner.

1654
01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:42.000
It's really nice
to trust someone.

1655
01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:48.734
(knocking at door)

1656
01:08:54.567 --> 01:08:56.734
Chef Northrup. I presume.

1657
01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.934
May I see your identification.
please?

1658
01:09:04.533 --> 01:09:06.133
Okay. Meg. I need to--
I need to tell you something.

1659
01:09:06.266 --> 01:09:09.667
Oh my gosh! I have to tell you
the latest with Etienne.

1660
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.700
He was babbling on and on.

1661
01:09:11.834 --> 01:09:14.834
saying that you're not being
who you say you are.

1662
01:09:14.967 --> 01:09:17.500
That guy! (chuckling)
- Meg. Meg.

1663
01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:21.166
He's right.
- (phone ringing)

1664
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.667
Oh. it's Heike.
Uh. sorry. One sec.

1665
01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:27.400
Miss Mueller. hi!
Is everything okay?

1666
01:09:27.533 --> 01:09:30.467
Chef Northrup.
I'm actually with him right now.

1667
01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.567
Yeah.

1668
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.166
We'll make our way over.

1669
01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.033
She wants us both to meet her
in the contest area.

1670
01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:39.567
It sounded urgent.

1671
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.967
Miss Mueller.

1672
01:09:45.133 --> 01:09:46.500
What's wrong?

1673
01:09:46.633 --> 01:09:49.000
I have been made aware of
a problem with Chef Northrup.

1674
01:09:49.133 --> 01:09:50.967
He's right here.

1675
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.333
Oh. no. He is right here.

1676
01:09:55.633 --> 01:09:57.633
You're a twin?

1677
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.066
You're not Julian?

1678
01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.500
Okay. Meg. I can explain.

1679
01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:05.533
You were pretending
to be your brother.

1680
01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:06.567
Why would you do that?

1681
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.000
You lied to me.

1682
01:10:08.133 --> 01:10:09.667
No. Meg. please--

1683
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.900
This wasn't Josh's idea.
He was only trying to help me.

1684
01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:15.667
Well. okay.
I don't care whose idea it was.

1685
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.834
Miss Mueller.
I am so. so sorry.

1686
01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:20.800
(scoffing) It's a little late
for sorry. Meg.

1687
01:10:20.934 --> 01:10:21.967
She is not to blame.

1688
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.500
Oh. there's plenty of blame
to go around.

1689
01:10:23.633 --> 01:10:26.400
This could have been
a terrible embarrassment

1690
01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:29.233
for the Escoffier.

1691
01:10:29.367 --> 01:10:32.700
Now. Chef Leduc has agreed
to keep this quiet.

1692
01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.567
provided Chef Northrup--

1693
01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.867
both of them--

1694
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.467
are banished
from the competition.

1695
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.200
No. Miss Mueller. please. This
is very important to my brother.

1696
01:10:41.333 --> 01:10:42.500
Well. you should have
thought of that

1697
01:10:42.633 --> 01:10:44.233
before you started
your little stunt.

1698
01:10:44.367 --> 01:10:45.900
I want you both gone
before nightfall.

1699
01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:47.800
(sighing)
And as for you.

1700
01:10:47.934 --> 01:10:51.734
Miss Westcott. the only reason
I am not firing you

1701
01:10:51.867 --> 01:10:54.367
is because we are less than
24 hours from the final round.

1702
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.834
and you are the only one
who knows

1703
01:10:57.967 --> 01:11:00.367
how things need to run
to make that happen.

1704
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.166
I understand.

1705
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.033
Again. I'm really sorry.
- No. Meg.

1706
01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:08.266
Wait.

1707
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.066
Wait!

1708
01:11:23.567 --> 01:11:24.700
(sighing)

1709
01:11:35.433 --> 01:11:36.834
I'm sorry I let you down.

1710
01:11:36.967 --> 01:11:39.767
You were just trying to help.
It's not your fault.

1711
01:11:42.066 --> 01:11:45.600
I really miss the days
when it was just you and me.

1712
01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:46.834
cooking with Mom.

1713
01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:50.734
It's not the same in Yakutat
without you there.

1714
01:11:50.867 --> 01:11:53.700
We used to be so close.
Josh.

1715
01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.934
Something did change.

1716
01:11:58.967 --> 01:12:00.233
Well. yeah.
It changed when you left

1717
01:12:00.367 --> 01:12:04.200
and decided to be
J Northrup.

1718
01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:08.333
No. No. it changed
because I had to get out

1719
01:12:08.467 --> 01:12:12.266
of that small town. Alaska
where I did not belong.

1720
01:12:14.367 --> 01:12:15.300
And as for J Northrup.

1721
01:12:15.433 --> 01:12:17.367
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry

1722
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.400
if I ever made you
feel guilty for staying.

1723
01:12:19.533 --> 01:12:22.233
Well. just because I stayed...

1724
01:12:22.367 --> 01:12:24.233
doesn't mean
that I didn't miss you.

1725
01:12:26.166 --> 01:12:27.867
Well. I miss you too.

1726
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.867
You know.
for the record.

1727
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.200
I don't wanna be that guy
anymore with no ambition.

1728
01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:39.500
And I owe that to you.

1729
01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:41.667
If you hadn't invited me.
I wouldn't have seen

1730
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.834
just how great I could be.

1731
01:12:44.967 --> 01:12:47.333
(chuckling)

1732
01:12:47.467 --> 01:12:49.300
So. thanks.
(clearing throat)

1733
01:12:52.967 --> 01:12:54.200
Whoa. hey. You okay?

1734
01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:56.166
- (Inhaling)
- You need some help?

1735
01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.233
No. I can--

1736
01:12:59.533 --> 01:13:02.200
Yes. I do.

1737
01:13:07.767 --> 01:13:11.066
Oh! Not too hard.

1738
01:13:14.867 --> 01:13:16.533
Okay. Hey. hey.

1739
01:13:16.667 --> 01:13:17.633
Have you talked to meg?

1740
01:13:17.767 --> 01:13:20.600
I don't think that
she wants to talk to me.

1741
01:13:20.734 --> 01:13:22.700
All right. well you need
to go fix that right away.

1742
01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:24.667
or else you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

1743
01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.867
Go!

1744
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.000
(footsteps approaching)

1745
01:13:40.767 --> 01:13:41.967
(sighing)

1746
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.800
For what it's worth.
I'm sorry.

1747
01:13:46.934 --> 01:13:49.066
I don't know
if I can forgive you.

1748
01:13:50.867 --> 01:13:53.066
I couldn't tell you.

1749
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.934
I had to help my brother.

1750
01:13:56.066 --> 01:13:58.467
Right.

1751
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.800
But it still should've been
my decision.

1752
01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:07.734
You can still compete.

1753
01:14:10.767 --> 01:14:14.033
What are you talking about?

1754
01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:15.633
The contract says
that anyone who signs it

1755
01:14:15.767 --> 01:14:17.200
can't make
any false representations

1756
01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:18.500
about their identity.

1757
01:14:18.633 --> 01:14:21.500
Yeah. but I did.
I was pretending to be Julian.

1758
01:14:21.633 --> 01:14:25.433
But the contract doesn't have
Julian Northrup's name on it.

1759
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.667
Because you signed it
"J Northrup".

1760
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.533
You're the official
registrant.

1761
01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:34.467
Right. but he was invited.
not me.

1762
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.033
Doesn't matter.

1763
01:14:36.166 --> 01:14:39.200
There's a loophole in the
contract that nobody noticed.

1764
01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:42.266
They'll close it by
next year's event. but for now--

1765
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.500
Listen. even I know
when it's time to call it quits.

1766
01:14:44.633 --> 01:14:46.166
It's--
(sighing)

1767
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.633
Compete or not.
that's entirely up to you.

1768
01:14:50.767 --> 01:14:53.767
But it seems to me that
if you wanna take risks.

1769
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.467
you won't do it
by giving up.

1770
01:14:58.734 --> 01:15:00.100
What about us?

1771
01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.300
There is no us.

1772
01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:09.533
I don't even know
who you are.

1773
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.900
Well. this is ridiculous.

1774
01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:24.700
Some of us
have studied for years.

1775
01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:26.667
Is it fair
to let somebody

1776
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.200
in this esteemed competition
on a technicality?

1777
01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:31.066
A technicality
that could result in a lawsuit

1778
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.133
if you don't abide by it.

1779
01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:39.033
Mr. Northrup.
you are hereby reinstated.

1780
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.367
Wonderful.

1781
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.033
Oh. and the rule book
also states

1782
01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:45.667
that if my sous chef
drops out.

1783
01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.367
then I can replace him
with someone else.

1784
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.934
Oh. Julian.
I just feel like I'm gonna--

1785
01:15:50.066 --> 01:15:51.233
Ah-choo!
I have to drop out.

1786
01:15:51.367 --> 01:15:52.934
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1787
01:15:53.066 --> 01:15:56.033
I'll have to take his place.

1788
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.600
Well. there you go.
May the best chefs win.

C'est la guerre.

1790
01:16:06.266 --> 01:16:07.567
Okay. we have about an hour

1791
01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.834

something incredible

1792

So. you don't think the
traditional peach Melba is it?

1794
01:16:12.233 --> 01:16:14.400
I think we have to be
more creative. you know?

1795

We're competing against some
of the best chefs in the world.

Okay.

1797
01:16:19.934 --> 01:16:21.066
So. what do we do?

1798
01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.767
We need to make a statement
about who we are.

1799
01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.500
