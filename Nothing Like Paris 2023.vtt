<i>Do you remember how
it felt when your heart fluttered?</i>

5
00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.665
<i>Do you remember
when you didn't have to talk</i>

6
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:25.085
<i>because with your eyes.
you both understood?</i>

7
00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.967
<i>Do you remember the warmth of the embrace?</i>

8
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.598
<i>Do you remember
the voice. the gentle whisper?</i>

9
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.898
<i>Do you remember the goosebumps
every time you kissed?</i>

10
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.281
<i>The heat of touch.</i>

11
00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.121
<i>the laughter. the fun times?</i>

12
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.424
<i>I remember.</i>

13
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.802
<i>I remember the way you smile.</i>

14
00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.061
<i>At last. you're here.</i>

15
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:11.066
<i>At last. this isn't the last.</i>

16
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.114
Hi. miss. What are you having?

17
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.201
- One coffee. please.
- Right away.

18
00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:33.172
5 p.m.. right on time.

19
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.510
At last. we meet again.

20
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:40.304
At last.

21
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:43.557
I still love you.

22
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.026
Now. I can return
all the love you gave me.

23
00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.656
That's no longer what I need.

24
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.328
Maybe it's better

25
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.207
if we accept
that we aren't meant for each other.

26
00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:00.217
<i>She is the only one for me.</i>

27
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.726
<i>But by the time I was arriving...</i>

28
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.147
<i>she was leaving.</i>

<i>Let's start.</i>

31
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.273
NOTHING LIKE PARIS

32
00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:33.477
<i>Let's start at when
fate brought us together.</i>

33
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.428
For you.

34
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:24.486
It's always the same.

35
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.865
Hello. my dear friend! Hey!

36
00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:33.829
Here's my handsome and hot friend. Jojo!

37
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.164
Thank you very much.

38
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:38.959
Vincent. come on.

39
00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.627
Come on. Let's go home.

40
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.045
Get your jacket. Come on.

41
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.672
What ? But no. but...

42
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.048
- Thank you!
- No...

43
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.133
Come on.

44
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.218
Let's go home.

45
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.679
Yeah. yeah.

46
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.640
We're going home.

47
00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.354
We're here. We're here. Vincent.

48
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.315
Go inside. Go inside.

49
00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:02.983
- Go.
- Okay.

50
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:04.776
Careful!

51
00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.154
Hey. How do you do that?

52
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.072
Do what?

53
00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:12.659
How do you move on from
one girl to another one right away?

54
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.286
What you do too. <i>pare</i>.

55
00:08:14.578 --> 00:08:16.288
<i>Pare</i>. mine is different.

56
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:19.082
I have many girls that I never love.

57
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:20.167
You know.

58
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:25.380
Your depressed old man
needs some company sometimes.

59
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.050
It's a need.

60
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.801
It's not love.

61
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.888
It's been four years. <i>pare</i>.

62
00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.058
Move on. Forget her.

63
00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:39.770
How can I move on when my heart
belongs to the one who broke it?

64
00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.023
Look at me.

65
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.860
All of these memories come back to me.

66
00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.529
But...

67
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:50.739
But...

68
00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.450
But she never does.

69
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.827
You're too drunk. <i>pare</i>.

70
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.747
Always. always.

71
00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.959
Better to be drunk

72
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:06.296
than you. who has been
waiting for someone who is unreal.

73
00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.215
That's not true.

74
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.471
It's really good.

75
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.442
It's nice.

76
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:28.735
Oh yeah.

77
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.823
It smells of coffee.

78
00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:36.076
Oh. I want one now. Please. babe.

79
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.453
Thank you so much.

80
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:41.832
Here you go.

81
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.085
Thank you.

82
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.338
She's so pretty.

83
00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:55.345
Who are you really?

84
00:09:56.138 --> 00:09:57.139
Mary.

85
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.183
Okay.

86
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.186
I'm Jojo.

87
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:08.150
Who are you?

88
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.234
Mary.

89
00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:11.737
That's me.

90
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.990
You should know. Marinel.

91
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.617
she looks nothing like you.

92
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:17.910
- That's not you.
- Mary.

93
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.162
You got some nerve.

94
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:21.413
Listen. Maribeth.

95
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:22.664
it's not you.

96
00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.125
Look closely.

97
00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:27.044
It's a spitting image.

98
00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:28.170
See?

99
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.633
Let me tell you. Mary Grace.

100
00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.676
Don't be delusional. That's not you.

101
00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:36.637
My name is Mary.

102
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.848
If this isn't me. then. who is it?

103
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:46.730
Jojo. How much for a portrait?

104
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.941
The store is closed.

105
00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:50.192
Next time?

106
00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:53.028
There is no next time. Marie.
Give me that.

107
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.657
Mister grumpy.
I'm not asking for a freebie.

108
00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:58.033
I have money.

109
00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.994
Keep it. Take care. Maricris.

110
00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.829
Mary.

111
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.548
<i>What's wrong?</i>

112
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.675
You know this girl...

113
00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.802
You and your girls again.

114
00:11:16.802 --> 00:11:18.053
No. no. no.

115
00:11:18.804 --> 00:11:19.930
This girl. Marie.

116
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:23.267
So. tell me about this Marie.

117
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.435
She is...

118
00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.188
Oh. nothing.

119
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.108
Nothing?

120
00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:32.818
It can't be nothing.

121
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.778
I know something is wrong.

122
00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.864
Come on. You can tell me.

123
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.408
I don't know her.

124
00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:41.535
but she said she's
the woman in the painting.

125
00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:43.537
Is she?

126
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.414
No.

127
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.332
Do they look similar?

128
00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:48.876
A little.

129
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.295
No. I mean. yes.

130
00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:53.463
No. Big no.

131
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.340
Maybe that's her.

132
00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:58.760
No. Impossible. No way.

133
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.389
Then. tell me. Where's your muse?

134
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.766
Where's the woman
you've been painting all along?

135
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.311
I don't know.

136
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.148
Then. how do you know it's not her?

137
00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.948
It's the feeling. Vincent.

138
00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:23.368
I'll know when I meet her.

139
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:25.370
My muse.

140
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.542
You're sick in your mind.

141
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.214
Crazy as we all are.

142
00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.424
You need a drink.

143
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.301
We are completely...

144
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:40.594
We're all crazy.

145
00:12:41.303 --> 00:12:43.472
We are pissed.

146
00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:45.974
<i>Mary Grace?</i>

147
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:47.684
<i>Marie Jo?</i>

148
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.811
<i>Maribeth?</i>

149
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:51.939
<i>Marites?</i>

150
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.149
<i>Marisol?</i>

151
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:56.860
<i>Marie?</i>

152
00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:58.946
<i>Marie.</i>

153
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:02.699
<i>I've decided it can't be.</i>

154
00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:04.368
<i>It's not you.</i>

155
00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.246
<i>You can't be the woman I'm painting.</i>

156
00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:13.335
Check out the cat's
eye makeup I did on her!

157
00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.504
Looks more like an alley cat!

158
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.423
I can feel good luck coming.

159
00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:21.593
You'll meet your special someone tonight.

160
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.303
This way.

161
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.973
Let's see if these
alley cat eyes will work.

162
00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:27.057
Let's go!

163
00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.267
Your witchcraft better be powerful. Jenny.

164
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:29.685
Jesus!

165
00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:31.645
One. two. three!

166
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.648
- What I'm telling you here.
- Oh. there it is!

167
00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:36.733
HOSTEL
BLUE BOAR

168
00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:44.283
- It's been ages since I went to a club.
- An age of one year?

169
00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.536
I forgot to buy cigarettes.

170
00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:50.539
You can worry about that later.

171
00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:52.457
- Girl. I'm dying for a smoke.
- I'll get them.

172
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.625
I'm buying other stuff anyway.

173
00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:01.508
Hi there.

174
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.843
How's it going?

175
00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.595
Where are your drinks?

176
00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:06.847
- Over there.
- I see them. Thank you.

177
00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:29.912
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

178
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.341
- My neighbor. three packs of M Lights.
- Three packs of M Lights.

179
00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.261
Are you following me?

180
00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:47.846
Of course not.

181
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:51.600
Yeah. right.

182
00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.395
It's amazing. right?

183
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.482
Like fate brought us together again.

184
00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:01.568
You mean coincidence.

185
00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:08.534
So. why are you following me?

186
00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:10.285
I'm not following you.

187
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:13.205
I bought some stuff.
then I'm walking to that bar.

188
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.749
You smoke too much.

189
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.626
These aren't mine.

190
00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:19.545
I bought it for my friends.

191
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.880
You're the one who smokes too much.

192
00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:23.841
I bought these for someone. too.

193
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.718
Why the interrogation?

194
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.054
Are you my girlfriend?

195
00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:30.889
Only girlfriends can ask questions?

196
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.975
And why are you headed in my direction?

197
00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:34.977
Why not?

198
00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:37.229
Do you own this road?

199
00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:39.398
This is the way to my apartment. see?

200
00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:41.942
Why are you so grumpy?

201
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.779
Marie. please.

202
00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.239
Don't follow me.

203
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.324
I'm not ready.

204
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:51.994
Nice to see you.

205
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.204
Bye.

206
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.441
<i>There you are again.</i>

207
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.832
<i>Fate keeps bringing us together.</i>

208
00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:37.766
<i>Maybe...</i>

209
00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:42.271
<i>it isn't so bad if I let you into my life.</i>

210
00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:56.410
And then...

211
00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:59.538
Put some white on the face

212
00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:04.418
and a heart shape on the lips.

213
00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:08.255
There. Nice.

214
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.841
- Perfect.
- Done? Let me see.

215
00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:11.925
Take a look.

216
00:18:15.012 --> 00:18:16.597
I didn't know this would be so hard to do.

217
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.349
Yeah. you get used to it.

218
00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:23.061
So. what got into your head

219
00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:26.356
when you suddenly appeared and joined me?

220
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.735
Nothing. I got amused

221
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.154
watching you perform in front of a crowd

222
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.156
like you had no care in the world.

223
00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:36.325
I thought. "What the heck.
I want to be part of that."

224
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:39.786
- Thank you for letting me.
- I didn't exactly let you.

225
00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.955
You suddenly appeared.

226
00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.874
But I helped your act. right?

227
00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:45.918
Stay right there.

228
00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:48.128
I'll get you something.

229
00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.634
It's ready.

230
00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.182
Here.

231
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.267
- Thank you.
- Taste it.

232
00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.312
I'll get one for me.

233
00:19:09.525 --> 00:19:10.609
Benguet or Atok?

234
00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:11.985
Atok.

235
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:13.862
Hey. you're smart.

236
00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:15.697
How did you know that?

237
00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:17.366
I'm from Baguio.

238
00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:21.161
For real? I'm from Baguio too.

239
00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:26.291
Well. originally from Pangasinan.

240
00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:28.126
but I went to school in Baguio.

241
00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.505
This drink. it was given to me
by a fellow Filipino.

242
00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:35.425
They saw me perform. Something like that.

243
00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.387
But it's awesome
that you're also from Baguio.

244
00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:39.847
Small world. right?

245
00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:43.600
Where did you learn to mime?

246
00:19:45.978 --> 00:19:47.521
Did you take classes?

247
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:50.065
I mean. theater. whatever.

248
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.818
No. I'm not a professional. okay?

249
00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:54.278
You taught me in college.

250
00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:55.904
Huh?

251
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:57.656
Mary.

252
00:19:58.574 --> 00:20:00.951
Your classmate in high school.
then we met again in college.

253
00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:02.244
and then...

254
00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:04.705
You used to help out
in my family's <i>pares</i> shop.

255
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.008
Oh. shucks.

256
00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:17.926
Right. Sorry.

257
00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.388
I remember. Forgive me.

258
00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.640
I've become forgetful nowadays.

259
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.603
There are many things I don't remember.

260
00:20:27.603 --> 00:20:29.521
especially if they're not important.

261
00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:33.108
But you remember. right?

262
00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:34.568
Of course!

263
00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.403
Classmates.

264
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.529
<i>Pares</i> shop...

265
00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:46.205
Never mind. it's not important.

266
00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.749
What's important is
we saw each other again.

267
00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:52.336
Yeah. What a small world.

268
00:20:53.212 --> 00:20:55.923
A reunion in Paris. of all places!

269
00:20:57.174 --> 00:20:59.468
How did you end up here anyway?

270
00:20:59.468 --> 00:21:00.969
Have you been here long?

271
00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:02.304
Three months now.

272
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:03.931
but my visa is good for two years.

273
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:07.059
So. I do cleaning. tidying.

274
00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:10.062
slave work. odd jobs. And you?

275
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.606
I've been here four years.

276
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:16.401
A friend who's also an artist took me in.

277
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:20.197
I decided to take my chances
in a faraway land.

278
00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.574
Just for a change.

279
00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:24.701
Do you have a wife?

280
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.620
Wow. that was fast.

281
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.871
You're already asking me that?

282
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:30.958
No wife.

283
00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:32.084
Girlfriend?

284
00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:34.127
Nope.

285
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:36.630
- Any snag?
- What's that?

286
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.091
Maybe you're somebody's
secret lover or something.

287
00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:40.259
Hell. no.

288
00:21:41.093 --> 00:21:42.177
That's good.

289
00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:44.847
Why are you asking?

290
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:46.431
Because...

291
00:21:47.224 --> 00:21:48.433
Because what?

292
00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.060
I like you.

293
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.604
- Oh no! Are you okay?
- Ouch!

294
00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:54.857
Are you okay?

295
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.192
Are you okay in the head?

296
00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:59.111
<i>I only said I like you.</i>

297
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:01.196
<i>I didn't say love me right away.</i>

298
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:04.992
Did you know? Somebody told me

299
00:22:04.992 --> 00:22:08.161
we only really love
three people in our lives.

300
00:22:08.537 --> 00:22:11.206
<i>Have you found those three people?</i>

301
00:22:11.707 --> 00:22:13.125
- Not yet.
- That's good.

302
00:22:15.127 --> 00:22:16.128
Why is that good?

303
00:22:16.128 --> 00:22:18.130
It means I have three chances with you.

304
00:22:19.256 --> 00:22:21.091
You're looking at the first one now.

305
00:22:25.637 --> 00:22:27.181
Too slow!

306
00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:37.316
Stop.

307
00:22:40.736 --> 00:22:41.904
You sure you're good?

308
00:22:42.613 --> 00:22:44.573
Yeah. it's just a skip away.

309
00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:45.741
Do you want me to take you to your house?

310
00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:48.035
Whoa. I should be the one to do that.

311
00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:50.913
- I can do it.
- I'm fine. <i>mademoiselle</i>.

312
00:22:52.164 --> 00:22:53.457
Marie.

313
00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:55.751
do you want to partner up next time?

314
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:56.835
Oh.

315
00:22:58.337 --> 00:23:00.756
It's up to you if you want me to.

316
00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:02.424
Absolutely.

317
00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:03.926
You're kind of cool to be with.

318
00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:06.136
Cool.

319
00:23:13.769 --> 00:23:14.937
It's the same.

320
00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.189
-"It's the same"?
- Nice.

321
00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:20.400
Cool.

322
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.610
- Cool?
- Nice.

323
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.655
It's the same? Cool?

324
00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:37.209
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

325
00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:39.127
<i>Why is it like that?</i>

326
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.380
<i>Everything felt so sudden.</i>

327
00:23:46.635 --> 00:23:48.595
<i>Things happened suddenly.</i>

328
00:23:51.515 --> 00:23:53.642
<i>All of a sudden. you were in my life.</i>

329
00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:23.755
<i>I wish it were true</i>

330
00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:26.717
<i>that you and I are meant for each other.</i>

331
00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:48.530
Where are we rushing to?
We haven't even changed.

332
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.656
You'll see.

333
00:24:49.656 --> 00:24:51.408
What time is it?

334
00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:55.120
- It says 4:55.
- Perfect.

335
00:24:55.412 --> 00:24:56.413
Come on.

336
00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:01.084
Come on!

337
00:25:06.173 --> 00:25:07.549
What?

338
00:25:12.888 --> 00:25:14.556
There. It's almost five.

339
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:16.558
- Let's do it.
- What do we do?

340
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:18.268
Let's make a wish. We'll close our eyes.

341
00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.645
Close them? Okay.

342
00:25:19.645 --> 00:25:21.188
- At the same time.
- Okay.

343
00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:26.318
<i>If she finishes her wish before me.</i>

344
00:25:27.194 --> 00:25:30.614
<i>then. she is the one for me.</i>

345
00:25:30.614 --> 00:25:31.782
You done?

346
00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:33.325
Yup.

347
00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:35.285
What did you wish for?

348
00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:36.411
- You.
- Huh?

349
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:38.914
I mean. you finished making your wish too?

350
00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:42.709
Let's eat. You're paying.

351
00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.211
Let's go.

352
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:46.588
- That was my wish.
- Really?

353
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:48.799
That you feed me because I'm hungry.

354
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.801
Cheapskate.

355
00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:55.389
So. there I was. under the sundial.

356
00:25:56.056 --> 00:25:59.142
passing time. doing some thinking

357
00:25:59.685 --> 00:26:01.478
about what I should be doing.

358
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.981
I happened to look up.

359
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:05.357
I saw the clock.

360
00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:08.944
Have you heard of Salvador Dali?

361
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:10.863
I think he was my classmate
in high school.

362
00:26:10.863 --> 00:26:13.532
How can Salvador Dali be your classmate?

363
00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:15.868
He was a famous painter.

364
00:26:16.702 --> 00:26:18.829
They have the same name!

365
00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:22.332
So. what's your favorite painting
by Salvador Dali?

366
00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:24.710
<i>Persistence of Memory</i>.

367
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.587
<i>Persistence of Memory</i>.

368
00:26:27.713 --> 00:26:30.757
The one with the melting clocks.

369
00:26:31.216 --> 00:26:34.344
Wow. that's deep.

370
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.681
What's so funny?

371
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.433
Nothing. really.

372
00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:44.980
Dali's inspiration
was melting Camembert cheese

373
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.148
- under the sun.
- Wow.

374
00:26:46.148 --> 00:26:47.900
- Is that true?
- Yes.

375
00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:51.445
Well. for me. it has a different meaning.

376
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:53.822
Time.

377
00:26:55.157 --> 00:26:56.825
Past memories.

378
00:26:57.326 --> 00:26:58.869
Slowly melting.

379
00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.913
Slowly vanishing.

380
00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:05.167
It's about feelings.

381
00:27:06.084 --> 00:27:07.085
Hard to explain.

382
00:27:07.419 --> 00:27:09.463
Aren't all paintings like that?

383
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.007
Different interpretations can arise

384
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:14.259
based on the feelings of the beholder.

385
00:27:14.718 --> 00:27:16.345
Nice!

386
00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:18.805
Sorry. you're rubbing off on me.

387
00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:22.476
- I want to ask you something.
- What is it?

388
00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:24.561
Have you tried a French kiss?

389
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:26.271
Not yet. Only french fries.

390
00:27:26.271 --> 00:27:27.564
You want to try?

391
00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:28.732
Do you?

392
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.404
Well? Am I making you blush?

393
00:27:34.404 --> 00:27:35.822
You're not making me blush!

394
00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:36.990
I need to pee.

395
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:05.185
Wow.

396
00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:07.563
These are beautiful.

397
00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:10.816
That side is Vincent's.

398
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:12.568
Those are his artworks.

399
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:14.319
And then.

400
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.281
on this side. mine.

401
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:20.993
- You comfy?
- Yeah. I'll look around.

402
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:23.537
Make yourself at home.

403
00:28:23.537 --> 00:28:25.789
I have wine.

404
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:27.499
- There's only red. Is that okay?
- Fine by me.

405
00:28:27.499 --> 00:28:29.168
Alright.

406
00:28:47.477 --> 00:28:48.478
Everything's okay?

407
00:28:48.979 --> 00:28:49.980
Maybe if you move faster.

408
00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:54.401
This is for you.

409
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:56.695
This is for me.

410
00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:58.989
Okay.

411
00:29:00.073 --> 00:29:01.283
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

412
00:29:03.327 --> 00:29:04.411
- Hey!
- Ouch!

413
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:06.330
- What was that?
- Your electricity shocked me.

414
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.789
I almost spilled my wine.

415
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:11.585
I know. We really have a spark.

416
00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:13.921
What are you talking about. Marie?

417
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:17.174
You haven't finished your glass of wine

418
00:29:17.174 --> 00:29:18.509
and you're already drunk?

419
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:20.427
Why won't you believe me?

420
00:29:20.427 --> 00:29:21.595
Don't you like me?

421
00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:24.014
Marie. it's not that.

422
00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:27.518
You have the looks...

423
00:29:29.102 --> 00:29:30.354
but not stunning.

424
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:35.275
It will do.

425
00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:38.153
But seriously. Marie.

426
00:29:39.112 --> 00:29:40.364
you're alright.

427
00:29:44.243 --> 00:29:45.244
I like you.

428
00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:48.205
Really? You like me?

429
00:29:48.914 --> 00:29:49.915
Isn't it obvious?

430
00:29:49.915 --> 00:29:52.626
Would I string you along
if I didn't like you?

431
00:29:57.464 --> 00:29:58.674
What about you?

432
00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:01.510
What attracted you to me
aside from my looks?

433
00:30:03.804 --> 00:30:05.347
Just that.

434
00:30:05.597 --> 00:30:07.182
You're always cheerful.

435
00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:08.851
fun to be with.

436
00:30:09.268 --> 00:30:10.394
I know that already.

437
00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:16.859
You're the kind of guy who would
risk everything for what he wants.

438
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.987
When you want something. you go for it.

439
00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:21.613
No hesitations.

440
00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:23.824
As if it's a game of chance.

441
00:30:23.824 --> 00:30:25.492
Is that what it's called?

442
00:30:25.993 --> 00:30:28.203
You'd bet everything.
no matter the outcome.

443
00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:29.997
So. you're into gamblers.

444
00:30:30.873 --> 00:30:31.874
I'm serious!

445
00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:37.212
All I'm saying is we should risk
when there's a chance.

446
00:30:38.672 --> 00:30:41.383
- Huh?
- Jojo. you still don't get it?

447
00:30:42.384 --> 00:30:44.052
We were classmates in high school.

448
00:30:44.052 --> 00:30:46.513
then we met again
during college in Baguio.

449
00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:49.558
and now. we meet again in Paris.

450
00:30:50.392 --> 00:30:52.352
What does it all mean? It's a sign.

451
00:30:52.978 --> 00:30:55.147
A sign that fate wanted us to meet.

452
00:30:55.147 --> 00:30:57.399
that there's a plan for us.

453
00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:00.694
And that's why we should
take a chance at each other.

454
00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:03.071
Wow.

455
00:31:03.947 --> 00:31:05.782
But we do have a spark!

456
00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:07.242
Spark?

457
00:31:07.534 --> 00:31:09.328
Yeah. Here. Try it again.

458
00:31:09.328 --> 00:31:10.412
- What?
- This.

459
00:31:10.412 --> 00:31:11.830
- Like what happened?
- Yes.

460
00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:57.125
Do you believe in soulmates?

461
00:31:57.751 --> 00:31:58.836
I used to.

462
00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:02.589
Now. I'm not so sure.

463
00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.342
- Why?
- You're my soulmate.

464
00:32:05.676 --> 00:32:06.760
How can you say that?

465
00:32:07.553 --> 00:32:10.806
I just feel it.

466
00:32:10.806 --> 00:32:12.307
Because we're a perfect fit.

467
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:14.309
That's how soulmates are.

468
00:32:14.309 --> 00:32:17.521
Even if we didn't fit
so much in the beginning.

469
00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:18.939
suddenly. we did.

470
00:32:19.356 --> 00:32:22.025
Even if it's only been
three months together.

471
00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:23.986
I'm never letting you go.

472
00:32:23.986 --> 00:32:25.237
Who knows where you might wander off.

473
00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:29.491
Marie.

474
00:32:30.993 --> 00:32:31.994
There is no us.

475
00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:33.412
You know. Jojo.

476
00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:35.247
that's where we're headed.

477
00:32:35.247 --> 00:32:36.790
Don't resist. It's the same.

478
00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:42.254
<i>- Atiklaham.
- Atiklaham?</i>

479
00:32:42.838 --> 00:32:44.214
When you say it backwards.

480
00:32:44.214 --> 00:32:45.841
it's "<i>mahal kita</i>".

481
00:32:46.508 --> 00:32:48.010
If you're not ready to profess.

482
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.428
you can just say "<i>atiklaham</i>".

483
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:50.846
Marie.

484
00:32:51.972 --> 00:32:54.141
I don't want to ruin what we have now.

485
00:32:55.684 --> 00:32:57.186
And my head is a mess.

486
00:32:57.978 --> 00:32:59.688
I keep changing what I want.

487
00:32:59.938 --> 00:33:01.565
You were the one who said

488
00:33:01.565 --> 00:33:03.233
that there is no us yet.

489
00:33:03.942 --> 00:33:07.321
So. don't worry about it
until we get there.

490
00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:09.907
- Fine.
- For real?

491
00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:12.868
<i>Atiklaham.</i> You paddle.

492
00:33:15.996 --> 00:33:18.415
Two baguettes and <i>pain de campagne.</i>

493
00:33:18.415 --> 00:33:19.541
<i>Pain de campgane.</i>

494
00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:21.084
10 euros. please.

495
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:22.211
Thank you so much.

496
00:33:24.713 --> 00:33:26.381
Hurry up.

497
00:33:26.381 --> 00:33:28.050
I don't want my boss
to get there before me.

498
00:33:28.717 --> 00:33:31.178
Marie! Wait for me!

499
00:33:32.763 --> 00:33:33.847
Always.

500
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.308
I will always wait for you.

501
00:33:38.018 --> 00:33:40.979
Wow. so dramatic.

502
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.481
Move it!

503
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.691
Move in?

504
00:33:44.691 --> 00:33:46.401
But we just met!

505
00:33:47.861 --> 00:33:49.112
What the heck?

506
00:33:49.112 --> 00:33:50.197
Let's go.

507
00:33:50.197 --> 00:33:52.449
You say the silliest things.

508
00:33:52.449 --> 00:33:53.575
One day. you'll see.

509
00:33:53.575 --> 00:33:54.868
That's what skipping meals does to you.

510
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:56.703
Come on.

511
00:34:04.086 --> 00:34:05.087
We're here.

512
00:34:08.924 --> 00:34:10.592
<i>I'm ready now. Marie.</i>

513
00:34:14.847 --> 00:34:16.223
<i>But the truth is.</i>

514
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.226
<i>I'm still scared.</i>

515
00:34:25.983 --> 00:34:27.359
Jojo. stop that.

516
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.071
Let's clean this up.

517
00:34:31.405 --> 00:34:32.656
Hi. Louie.

518
00:34:32.656 --> 00:34:34.408
Hi. Marie. How are you?

519
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:36.743
Yeah. I'm good.

520
00:34:37.494 --> 00:34:39.621
Mamou. I want you to meet Jojo.

521
00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:42.040
Remember I told you I'll bring him here.

522
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.250
Yes. of course.

523
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.960
Nice to meet you. Jojo.

524
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.504
Hi. <i>madame</i>. Hi. sir.

525
00:34:50.591 --> 00:34:52.050
Look. they've prepared us some snacks.

526
00:34:55.345 --> 00:34:56.722
He loves chocolate.

527
00:34:58.015 --> 00:35:01.268
But the doctor says you should cut
your sugar intake. okay?

528
00:35:02.019 --> 00:35:04.188
So. one chocolate is enough for the week.

529
00:35:07.065 --> 00:35:09.735
I know you love chocolates.

530
00:35:10.819 --> 00:35:15.240
So. you choose. my love. Chocolates or me?

531
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:20.078
Oh. my love.

532
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:22.414
You are really sweet.

533
00:35:22.915 --> 00:35:25.292
You are really sweet. my love.

534
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.837
I'll let you have some.

535
00:35:29.338 --> 00:35:30.464
Here.

536
00:35:30.464 --> 00:35:31.882
This is for you.

537
00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:34.718
You are really sweet.

538
00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:39.806
What a beautiful couple. you two.

539
00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:41.642
Yeah.

540
00:35:41.642 --> 00:35:43.685
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

541
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.231
It's...

542
00:35:47.231 --> 00:35:49.858
No. we're friends.

543
00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:52.945
Yes. we're just friends.

544
00:35:54.488 --> 00:35:55.489
For now.

545
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.991
We'll never know tomorrow.

546
00:36:02.871 --> 00:36:04.039
Hold on a second.

547
00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:07.417
What are we doing in a cemetery?

548
00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:08.794
We're making a wish.

549
00:36:09.378 --> 00:36:11.338
Hurry. it's almost 5 p.m.

550
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:13.757
This one.

551
00:36:14.967 --> 00:36:18.095
Why is that thing naked? My eyes!

552
00:36:18.095 --> 00:36:19.346
That's the way it is.

553
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.056
Come here.

554
00:36:22.975 --> 00:36:24.017
What is that for?

555
00:36:24.017 --> 00:36:25.644
It's part of the wish.

556
00:36:26.645 --> 00:36:27.855
Huh?

557
00:36:28.939 --> 00:36:34.069
<i>Oh no. Glances like that are my weakness.</i>

558
00:36:34.444 --> 00:36:40.200
They say you make a wish when
you have pain or disappointments.

559
00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:43.537
You make a wish to make them go away.

560
00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:45.789
That's what we're going to do.

561
00:36:47.416 --> 00:36:48.709
Do we need this thing?

562
00:36:48.709 --> 00:36:51.336
They say it makes it more effective.

563
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.046
Come on. Let's make a wish here.

564
00:36:53.046 --> 00:36:54.631
- Where?
- Just here.

565
00:36:55.299 --> 00:36:56.341
Close your eyes.

566
00:37:02.848 --> 00:37:04.266
<i>I wish you were the one.</i>

567
00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:08.770
You done?

568
00:37:10.689 --> 00:37:13.442
- You done with your wish?
- Yeah. I made a wish.

569
00:37:13.734 --> 00:37:15.777
Okay. take that off.

570
00:37:17.112 --> 00:37:18.947
Then. you shake it off.

571
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:20.532
Huh?

572
00:37:20.949 --> 00:37:24.077
Because when you shake it off like that.

573
00:37:25.037 --> 00:37:28.457
all the pain you wished away will vanish.

574
00:37:28.749 --> 00:37:30.125
There. Shake it off.

575
00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:33.337
Harder! Pain. pain. go. Then. dance.

576
00:37:33.837 --> 00:37:34.838
What?

577
00:37:34.838 --> 00:37:37.007
- Do it so the pain will disappear.
- Why?

578
00:37:37.007 --> 00:37:39.468
Pain. pain. go away.

579
00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:43.889
Throw away all the bad feelings. Dance!

580
00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:45.557
<i>I don't need any more wishes.</i>

581
00:37:46.975 --> 00:37:48.602
<i>You're here. Marie.</i>

582
00:38:01.532 --> 00:38:06.328
Hey. don't leave me behind.

583
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:17.464
Look. an Asian section.

584
00:38:20.259 --> 00:38:22.678
Oh! Sorry.

585
00:38:22.678 --> 00:38:23.929
What happened?

586
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:25.681
I saw this song.

587
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:27.015
What song?

588
00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:31.937
That's Rey Valera. He's my favorite.

589
00:38:32.479 --> 00:38:33.981
This is my favorite song.

590
00:38:34.356 --> 00:38:35.440
"No Exchange".

591
00:38:41.405 --> 00:38:47.327
<i>And even if the time doesn't come</i>

592
00:38:48.078 --> 00:38:52.207
<i>That you learn to love me back</i>

593
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:56.920
<i>Trust that I will not be mad</i>

594
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.967
<i>Even if it hurts me bad</i>

595
00:39:02.509 --> 00:39:06.388
<i>Just do not stop me</i>

596
00:39:06.972 --> 00:39:13.103
<i>From loving you</i>

597
00:39:15.189 --> 00:39:16.732
Give it to me. I'll pay for it.

598
00:39:16.732 --> 00:39:17.900
You're buying it now?

599
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:20.736
On our wedding.

600
00:39:21.236 --> 00:39:22.779
we'll play this.

601
00:39:40.756 --> 00:39:42.341
You're powerful.

602
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:07.449
There we go.

603
00:40:10.077 --> 00:40:11.495
<i>Atiklaham.</i>

604
00:40:12.412 --> 00:40:13.455
<i>Atiklaham.</i>

605
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:29.680
Marie.

606
00:40:36.854 --> 00:40:37.855
What's up?

607
00:40:50.868 --> 00:40:51.910
What is it?

608
00:40:55.622 --> 00:40:56.915
I love you.

609
00:41:05.632 --> 00:41:06.967
<i>Thank heavens.</i>

610
00:41:07.509 --> 00:41:10.762
<i>Fate has given me what is mine.</i>

611
00:41:51.053 --> 00:41:52.554
<i>But why doesn't it feel right?</i>

612
00:42:02.689 --> 00:42:04.441
<i>Why do I feel like something's missing?</i>

613
00:42:13.492 --> 00:42:16.620
<i>I finally met the person
who makes me happy.</i>

614
00:42:24.878 --> 00:42:26.588
<i>But why isn't it enough?</i>

615
00:42:28.841 --> 00:42:30.008
My friend!

616
00:42:31.218 --> 00:42:32.803
<i>Why did fate have to bring us together?</i>

617
00:42:52.406 --> 00:42:53.991
<i>It's not you?</i>

618
00:42:58.078 --> 00:43:00.247
<i>You're not the one I'm looking for?</i>

619
00:43:02.708 --> 00:43:04.293
<i>I don't know anymore.</i>

620
00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:11.341
Surprise!

621
00:43:14.469 --> 00:43:15.637
Surprise?

622
00:43:15.637 --> 00:43:17.723
I'm here!

623
00:43:18.223 --> 00:43:20.601
Vincent said he wasn't going home.

624
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:22.102
He's sleeping over at a friend's.

625
00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:23.270
That's why I'm here.

626
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:25.731
I made some burgers.

627
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:27.983
They're my specialty. Try it.

628
00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:29.234
Wait.

629
00:43:33.447 --> 00:43:34.573
Let's eat.

630
00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:37.951
Hold on. I have some beer.

631
00:43:37.951 --> 00:43:40.037
Goes well with the burgers.

632
00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:51.632
Oh. I also have some fried potatoes.

633
00:43:52.174 --> 00:43:54.301
I know that's your specialty.

634
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:56.094
So. they're just store-bought.

635
00:43:56.595 --> 00:43:57.971
Let me get them.

636
00:44:07.272 --> 00:44:08.440
Game?

637
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:28.210
- What's wrong?
- Tastes good?

638
00:44:29.336 --> 00:44:31.255
- Good.
- Hey.

639
00:44:31.255 --> 00:44:34.091
Today is our six-month anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

640
00:44:39.763 --> 00:44:42.266
I know you're not fond
of dates and anniversaries.

641
00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:45.310
I'm just so happy
we made it to six months.

642
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:47.145
For real?

643
00:44:48.313 --> 00:44:49.898
I know.

644
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.819
You're not the type
who counts the days or months.

645
00:44:54.194 --> 00:44:55.821
You don't even remember my birthday.

646
00:44:55.821 --> 00:44:58.615
You don't remember a lot of things.
But that's okay.

647
00:44:59.992 --> 00:45:01.326
Even I don't get it.

648
00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:03.453
Maybe I'm just wired this way.

649
00:45:04.121 --> 00:45:06.081
But if you truly love someone.

650
00:45:06.081 --> 00:45:08.876
shouldn't you be able to remember
the important stuff?

651
00:45:09.209 --> 00:45:11.920
But it's fine because I know
that's how you are.

652
00:45:12.212 --> 00:45:13.422
We're fine.

653
00:45:17.259 --> 00:45:18.802
Maybe we're not.

654
00:45:20.888 --> 00:45:22.264
What do you mean. we're not?

655
00:45:24.099 --> 00:45:26.727
Maybe we're not meant for each other.

656
00:45:27.477 --> 00:45:29.229
What are you talking about?

657
00:45:29.605 --> 00:45:31.231
I can't give you what you want.

658
00:45:35.152 --> 00:45:36.987
It's not your fault.

659
00:45:37.946 --> 00:45:39.156
I'm the problem. Marie.

660
00:45:39.573 --> 00:45:41.575
I told you my head's a mess.

661
00:45:43.035 --> 00:45:45.621
I don't even know why I act this way.

662
00:45:46.205 --> 00:45:47.873
Deep inside. you know what you want.

663
00:45:47.873 --> 00:45:50.751
you just don't want to
trust what you feel.

664
00:45:52.211 --> 00:45:54.880
I thought we had it different this time.

665
00:45:56.507 --> 00:45:57.883
I thought so. too.

666
00:45:58.634 --> 00:46:00.135
I was true to you.

667
00:46:02.763 --> 00:46:05.224
Whatever we had. it was genuine.

668
00:46:08.936 --> 00:46:10.020
So. that's it?

669
00:46:11.188 --> 00:46:14.733
You're just going to
forget everything? Us?

670
00:46:16.818 --> 00:46:18.487
I don't want to lie to you.

671
00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:21.365
That would hurt you even more.

672
00:46:30.123 --> 00:46:31.917
This is so unfair.

673
00:46:35.504 --> 00:46:37.756
What have I done wrong?

674
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:41.176
I can't figure it out.

675
00:46:43.387 --> 00:46:46.723
Maybe there's something I'm searching for.

676
00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:52.145
Okay.

677
00:46:53.397 --> 00:46:55.524
But for now. I just want to be alone.

678
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:02.489
You're sure that's what you want?

679
00:47:05.033 --> 00:47:07.494
But I don't want to lose you as a friend.

680
00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.080
I don't want to be just a friend.

681
00:47:11.832 --> 00:47:13.917
Marie. Marie. wait!

682
00:47:17.963 --> 00:47:19.089
Marie.

683
00:47:23.135 --> 00:47:24.678
Do you still love me?

684
00:47:31.226 --> 00:47:33.270
I hope you find the one for you.

685
00:47:35.689 --> 00:47:36.773
Marie.

686
00:47:37.316 --> 00:47:38.525
Mary.

687
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.445
Mary.

688
00:47:42.571 --> 00:47:45.782
But I became Marie for you. Joseph.

689
00:47:46.575 --> 00:47:49.161
I took a chance
that maybe you'll love me again.

690
00:48:16.188 --> 00:48:17.606
<i>When. Joseph?</i>

691
00:48:18.357 --> 00:48:21.276
<i>When will you remember
how our story began?</i>

692
00:48:22.861 --> 00:48:26.073
<i>Let's go to the start.
when fate toyed with our lives.</i>

693
00:48:55.644 --> 00:48:57.563
- Coming.
- Ma'am.

694
00:48:58.939 --> 00:49:01.400
- Can we have soda too?
- Some chili as well.

695
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.569
- Two. please.
- Ma'am.

696
00:49:03.569 --> 00:49:05.404
- What's your order?
- One <i>pares</i>.

697
00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:07.406
- Can we have soup?
- Beef stew?

698
00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:13.704
- Mary! Mary! Mary!
- Thank you. Thank you.

699
00:49:13.704 --> 00:49:15.163
Hurry up. Help me here.

700
00:49:17.124 --> 00:49:18.834
- Here you go.
- Two. please.

701
00:49:18.834 --> 00:49:21.170
Here. two bowls of soup.

702
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.547
One soda. please.

703
00:49:23.547 --> 00:49:24.882
Okay.

704
00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:29.469
Miss. Soda.

705
00:49:31.805 --> 00:49:33.098
Here you go.

706
00:49:35.267 --> 00:49:36.310
<i>Who are you?</i>

707
00:49:37.144 --> 00:49:39.313
<i>Why do you suddenly pop into my life?</i>

708
00:49:40.981 --> 00:49:42.566
- Joseph?
- Mary?

709
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.942
Hey!

710
00:49:43.942 --> 00:49:45.277
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing?

711
00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:46.945
- No. you go ahead
- No. no. you go ahead.

712
00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:48.864
- No. you go ahead.
- How are you?

713
00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:53.827
I came from Manila.
I'm here. in Baguio. to study.

714
00:49:55.204 --> 00:49:56.496
University of the Philippines
or University of Baguio?

715
00:49:56.914 --> 00:49:58.498
University of the Philippines.
How about you?

716
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:59.791
Baguio State University.

717
00:50:00.167 --> 00:50:02.127
That's great!

718
00:50:03.504 --> 00:50:04.922
- Final year?
- Yeah. I'm in my final year.

719
00:50:04.922 --> 00:50:07.007
I'm graduating this year.

720
00:50:07.007 --> 00:50:08.091
- Ah.
- You?

721
00:50:08.091 --> 00:50:10.052
I have two years to go. Transferee.

722
00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:12.679
What happened to you?

723
00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:14.765
You suddenly disappeared
after high school.

724
00:50:15.265 --> 00:50:17.434
We moved to Manila.

725
00:50:17.434 --> 00:50:20.395
Now. I'm back in Baguio.

726
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.898
I almost didn't recognize you.

727
00:50:22.898 --> 00:50:25.025
Your hair's different.

728
00:50:25.025 --> 00:50:26.443
and then. you have that mustache.

729
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:28.195
I'm handsome. right?

730
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.532
You know. when poverty hits...

731
00:50:33.075 --> 00:50:35.202
- Puberty hits?
- It's the same.

732
00:50:36.787 --> 00:50:38.497
It's so nice to see you again.

733
00:50:38.914 --> 00:50:40.207
Dammit. Maria!

734
00:50:40.207 --> 00:50:41.333
What now. Mary?

735
00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:43.043
You're just going to chat
with customers all day?

736
00:50:43.043 --> 00:50:45.087
- No. Auntie.
- Get to work.

737
00:50:45.087 --> 00:50:47.089
- Do you need a straw?
- No. Mary. It's okay.

738
00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:50.092
Here's my payment.

739
00:50:50.676 --> 00:50:51.802
I'll come back.

740
00:50:55.848 --> 00:50:57.140
Alright.

741
00:51:08.193 --> 00:51:09.319
Mary!

742
00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:12.614
Hey. Joseph.

743
00:51:13.115 --> 00:51:14.116
What are you doing here?

744
00:51:14.616 --> 00:51:16.201
Just taking a breeze.

745
00:51:16.743 --> 00:51:18.537
I didn't know I was
going to bump into you here.

746
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:21.957
Kidding.

747
00:51:21.957 --> 00:51:23.458
I was waiting for you.

748
00:51:24.293 --> 00:51:27.212
I got your schedule
from your snooty auntie.

749
00:51:27.212 --> 00:51:28.380
And she gave it to you?

750
00:51:28.881 --> 00:51:30.132
I have my ways.

751
00:51:30.132 --> 00:51:35.095
I ate a week's worth of <i>pares</i>
before she gave me your schedule.

752
00:51:35.679 --> 00:51:36.889
So. why are you waiting for me?

753
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:43.604
Because I was wondering if you
would go out with me to Ili-Likha.

754
00:51:43.937 --> 00:51:46.148
I think I've had enough <i>pares</i>.

755
00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:51.445
- But--
- No more buts. My treat.

756
00:51:53.113 --> 00:51:54.156
Move it.

757
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.534
- It's drizzling.
- No big deal.

758
00:52:01.997 --> 00:52:02.998
Careful.

759
00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:06.126
- Need help?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

760
00:52:06.126 --> 00:52:07.211
Okay.

761
00:52:12.633 --> 00:52:13.967
- Mary.
- Yes?

762
00:52:14.259 --> 00:52:15.636
What do you feel like eating?

763
00:52:17.262 --> 00:52:19.806
Burger and fruit shake.

764
00:52:25.896 --> 00:52:27.272
Why? What's so funny?

765
00:52:28.524 --> 00:52:30.234
That's also what I was thinking.

766
00:52:30.526 --> 00:52:32.069
Burger and fruit shake.

767
00:52:33.987 --> 00:52:34.988
Let's go?

768
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:44.081
Mary. thank you
for going on a date with me.

769
00:52:44.581 --> 00:52:45.582
Date?

770
00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:47.167
Friendly date!

771
00:52:47.167 --> 00:52:49.711
Stop making assumptions so easily.

772
00:52:50.087 --> 00:52:51.713
Really. now.

773
00:52:52.256 --> 00:52:55.050
Friendly date with naughty intentions.

774
00:52:57.302 --> 00:52:59.054
You're a piece of work.

775
00:52:59.346 --> 00:53:00.722
You think you're cute?

776
00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:03.183
Cute and funny.

777
00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:07.980
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

778
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.815
- This way.
- Not that way!

779
00:53:09.815 --> 00:53:11.817
- Where?
- Yes. that's the way.

780
00:53:12.067 --> 00:53:13.360
Annoying.

781
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.444
LITTLE HAPPINESS

782
00:53:27.332 --> 00:53:28.375
What?

783
00:53:29.585 --> 00:53:30.961
Are you not going to eat?

784
00:53:31.295 --> 00:53:32.504
Are you not going to talk?

785
00:53:32.504 --> 00:53:34.047
Are you just going to keep staring at me?

786
00:53:35.007 --> 00:53:36.216
How are you?

787
00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:39.511
I'm doing okay.

788
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:41.889
I'm out on a date without my knowledge.

789
00:53:43.015 --> 00:53:44.641
I'm informing you now.

790
00:53:45.017 --> 00:53:46.185
So. it's not a date?

791
00:53:46.852 --> 00:53:48.979
No. not exactly.

792
00:53:49.605 --> 00:53:53.066
Let's just say we're
getting to know each other.

793
00:53:53.066 --> 00:53:54.318
Catching up.

794
00:53:56.153 --> 00:53:58.989
Catching up?
But we already know each other.

795
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.408
You used to tease me in high school.

796
00:54:01.408 --> 00:54:02.910
- That's not true.
- Not true?

797
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.620
You called me dark-skinned.

798
00:54:05.287 --> 00:54:06.747
I meant natural Filipina beauty.

799
00:54:07.539 --> 00:54:09.666
You also said I was skinny.

800
00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:11.502
Don't you like being modelesque?

801
00:54:11.502 --> 00:54:12.753
You even had a name for me.

802
00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:15.297
What was that? Escrima Stick.

803
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.966
I was just trying to get your attention.

804
00:54:18.383 --> 00:54:19.801
You were a bully.

805
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:21.136
I wasn't.

806
00:54:21.929 --> 00:54:22.930
Because?

807
00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:25.349
Because...

808
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:28.852
I had a crush on you.

809
00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:32.022
Brain freeze?

810
00:54:33.649 --> 00:54:34.816
You're giving me a headache.

811
00:54:34.816 --> 00:54:36.610
I knew it.

812
00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:39.488
Even then. you had a crush on me.

813
00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:43.033
Is my drink causing amnesia?

814
00:54:43.033 --> 00:54:45.536
Because I don't remember
anything like that.

815
00:54:45.536 --> 00:54:46.703
By the way. Mary.

816
00:54:46.703 --> 00:54:48.622
I was wondering if you can
help me with my school project.

817
00:54:49.706 --> 00:54:51.375
I need someone to model for my painting.

818
00:54:52.209 --> 00:54:54.711
I thought of you. Are you available?

819
00:54:55.128 --> 00:54:57.297
All this crush talk.
you just need something from me.

820
00:54:57.673 --> 00:54:59.049
It's not like that.

821
00:54:59.049 --> 00:55:02.845
I've wanted to paint you
for the longest time.

822
00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:06.181
Because your beauty is one of a kind.

823
00:55:06.723 --> 00:55:08.141
The kind you don't get tired of.

824
00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:09.560
There's a name for it.

825
00:55:10.602 --> 00:55:11.895
Classic. That's it.

826
00:55:12.145 --> 00:55:14.523
Morena! Very Filipina.

827
00:55:16.817 --> 00:55:18.527
Okay. hear me out.

828
00:55:19.194 --> 00:55:20.946
I'll treat you to some snacks.

829
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.282
Just snacks?

830
00:55:23.282 --> 00:55:27.369
What if I help you and your aunt

831
00:55:27.369 --> 00:55:29.371
in your <i>pares</i> place? Deal?

832
00:55:31.832 --> 00:55:33.750
Cakes. nuts. popcorn! Yes. sir?

833
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.377
<i>Pares</i> for you. Yes. ma'am?

834
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.339
You two get together
so you can get a pair of <i>pares</i>.

835
00:55:39.339 --> 00:55:40.841
Your boyfriend's good.

836
00:55:40.841 --> 00:55:42.217
- Auntie...
- A catch.

837
00:55:42.217 --> 00:55:44.136
He's not my boyfriend.

838
00:55:44.636 --> 00:55:46.013
That's where you're heading anyway.

839
00:55:47.097 --> 00:55:50.100
Why would he work so hard
if he didn't like you?

840
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.352
What are your plans after college?

841
00:55:55.022 --> 00:55:56.690
Maybe I'll go to Paris.

842
00:55:57.232 --> 00:56:00.110
- Paris?
- Yeah. Oops. Sorry.

843
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.737
- Hey. are you okay?
- I'm okay.

844
00:56:01.737 --> 00:56:03.739
- Are you sure?
- No worries. Mary. No worries.

845
00:56:03.739 --> 00:56:04.823
Smile.

846
00:56:04.823 --> 00:56:07.034
You said you were going to paint me.

847
00:56:07.826 --> 00:56:09.244
But you just keep on taking photos.

848
00:56:09.244 --> 00:56:11.788
I need a basis.

849
00:56:12.623 --> 00:56:13.624
That's why.

850
00:56:13.874 --> 00:56:15.542
Catch me.

851
00:56:15.542 --> 00:56:16.627
Faster.

852
00:56:16.627 --> 00:56:18.462
- You're so annoying.
- There's a shortcut right there.

853
00:56:21.256 --> 00:56:24.510
"Born a star. lived a meteor.
died in flames."

854
00:56:25.177 --> 00:56:26.512
That must be something.

855
00:56:28.889 --> 00:56:30.849
To me. you're my star.

856
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:33.227
Wow. that's something. too.

857
00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:37.022
Hurry. Catch me.

858
00:56:37.272 --> 00:56:38.899
- Chase me!
- Are you trying to kill me?

859
00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:41.610
I didn't realize you were also
in the theater club in high school.

860
00:56:42.027 --> 00:56:45.739
Maybe you just didn't notice me
back then because I looked like a gnome.

861
00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:47.741
Is that why?

862
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:49.451
Why? What do you look like now?

863
00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:50.994
A gecko.

864
00:56:51.203 --> 00:56:52.538
At least you know.

865
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:56.124
"Born humbly. died sometime."

866
00:56:57.209 --> 00:56:59.211
- Died.
- I know. That was a joke.

867
00:56:59.503 --> 00:57:01.046
I don't get it.

868
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.506
You don't?

869
00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:04.633
Me too.

870
00:57:06.218 --> 00:57:08.720
You make good coffee. This is delicious.

871
00:57:09.012 --> 00:57:12.140
I learned that from friends
here and there.

872
00:57:12.766 --> 00:57:15.894
Sometimes you'll make bitter coffee.

873
00:57:15.894 --> 00:57:18.397
Sometimes. too light.

874
00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:22.568
But you just keep on trying until the end.

875
00:57:22.818 --> 00:57:27.072
Because it feels good
when you get what you want.

876
00:57:27.698 --> 00:57:29.408
Because you strived for it.

877
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:34.454
Wow. all those words
of wisdom from coffee?

878
00:57:34.705 --> 00:57:36.248
Mary! Mary!

879
00:57:37.499 --> 00:57:39.251
- Mary!
- What?

880
00:57:39.585 --> 00:57:40.586
Will you marry me?

881
00:57:40.586 --> 00:57:42.129
BEEF STEW- EGG WITH FRIED RICE

882
00:57:42.838 --> 00:57:43.839
That must be something.

883
00:57:43.839 --> 00:57:45.424
You're full of nonsense.

884
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:46.967
Don't say yes

885
00:57:46.967 --> 00:57:48.552
because I'm not ready.

886
00:57:48.552 --> 00:57:50.971
We have no pastor. but we have <i>pares</i>.

887
00:57:53.473 --> 00:57:54.725
Me. I'm ready.

888
00:57:54.725 --> 00:57:56.268
Really?

889
00:57:56.268 --> 00:57:58.270
Ready to punch your face.

890
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:03.901
<i>Maybe there's nothing wrong
when your heart flutters once in a while.</i>

891
00:58:06.528 --> 00:58:08.238
Tell me where we're going.

892
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.240
I was going to surprise you.

893
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.992
but never mind.

894
00:58:11.992 --> 00:58:14.745
- What is it?
- We're eloping.

895
00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.789
Are you being serious?

896
00:58:18.749 --> 00:58:20.209
Why should we wait?

897
00:58:20.209 --> 00:58:22.085
That's where we're headed anyway.

898
00:58:22.461 --> 00:58:24.463
So. let's just elope.

899
00:58:25.088 --> 00:58:26.548
And where are we going?

900
00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:27.633
There.

901
00:58:28.675 --> 00:58:30.719
Is that your house?

902
00:58:30.719 --> 00:58:32.930
- Yes. it is.
- So cute.

903
00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:39.937
- We're here.
- Wow. your house is beautiful.

904
00:58:42.314 --> 00:58:47.194
- Hey. I'm sorry I didn't tidy up.
- I don't mind.

905
00:58:49.321 --> 00:58:54.076
- Mary. have a seat.
- Sure.

906
00:58:54.076 --> 00:58:55.536
I'll just heat some water.

907
00:58:55.869 --> 00:58:57.412
I'll make you coffee.

908
00:58:57.871 --> 00:58:59.373
- Okay?
- Good.

909
00:58:59.373 --> 00:59:00.457
Good.

910
00:59:00.707 --> 00:59:07.089
Wow. this is pretty.

911
00:59:13.428 --> 00:59:14.429
Coffee?

912
00:59:15.347 --> 00:59:16.348
Yeah.

913
00:59:16.765 --> 00:59:19.852
Your medium is coffee. It's beautiful.

914
00:59:22.604 --> 00:59:26.233
- What's wrong?
- It's beautiful. but it has no heart.

915
00:59:26.984 --> 00:59:28.527
That's what my professor said.

916
00:59:28.735 --> 00:59:31.488
He said a lot of people
can paint like that.

917
00:59:32.573 --> 00:59:34.825
But what art needs is heart.

918
00:59:35.951 --> 00:59:38.078
That is what will make your work unique.

919
00:59:39.037 --> 00:59:40.497
That's deep.

920
00:59:43.834 --> 00:59:45.627
It's why I chose you as my model.

921
00:59:46.545 --> 00:59:47.546
Because?

922
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:50.007
You're my heart.

923
00:59:54.344 --> 00:59:56.471
I got lucky with this house

924
00:59:56.471 --> 00:59:59.641
because my uncle let me stay
while I'm in school.

925
01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.019
It's a lovely place.

926
01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:03.604
Thanks.

927
01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:07.149
Of course. thank you as well
for agreeing to elope.

928
01:00:07.149 --> 01:00:09.276
Oh. wow.

929
01:00:10.527 --> 01:00:12.070
What's so funny?

930
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.615
I have a question.

931
01:00:15.324 --> 01:00:17.910
How did you come up
with the idea of using coffee?

932
01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:20.162
My medium used to be watercolor.

933
01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:21.914
Then. one day.

934
01:00:21.914 --> 01:00:24.374
I was drinking coffee.

935
01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:28.295
and it was so hot
that I blew it all over the sketchpad.

936
01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:30.589
It formed an image.

937
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:32.424
and I was like. "Wow. that's art!"

938
01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:34.426
Nice.

939
01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:36.470
Favorite color?

940
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.555
Really. slam book questions?

941
01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:39.890
Okay.

942
01:00:40.557 --> 01:00:41.683
Favorite song?

943
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.354
-"No Exchange".
- For real?

944
01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:48.148
By Rey Valera?

945
01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:50.651
Me too. That's my favorite.

946
01:01:01.245 --> 01:01:07.626
<i>Don't be surprised
When I am no longer waiting</i>

947
01:01:08.418 --> 01:01:15.259
<i>For anything in exchange
Of the love I have offered</i>

948
01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:21.640
<i>Even though you don't look my way enough</i>

949
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:29.773
<i>I will give everything to you
Even if you don't notice</i>

950
01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:35.904
So. why is it your favorite?

951
01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:40.534
Because when I first heard it
when we were still kids.

952
01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:41.910
I thought.

953
01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:44.830
is that really how one should love?

954
01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.623
Not expecting anything in return?

955
01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:51.962
Then I thought.
maybe true love really is like that.

956
01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:54.965
You should be willing to give
everything you've got

957
01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.301
despite the uncertainties
you may have for each other.

958
01:01:57.718 --> 01:02:01.471
Do you think you can really love someone
without expecting anything in return?

959
01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:09.313
Wherever we end up.

960
01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:13.233
trust that I will always
be waiting for you

961
01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.402
with no exchange.

962
01:02:20.324 --> 01:02:21.366
Careful.

963
01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:25.954
It's so stunning.

964
01:02:26.914 --> 01:02:28.123
Majestic.

965
01:02:28.457 --> 01:02:29.791
Come on. It's time.

966
01:02:30.918 --> 01:02:32.377
- What's going on?
- Give me your hand.

967
01:02:32.377 --> 01:02:34.588
I always go to this spot at 5 p.m.

968
01:02:35.047 --> 01:02:36.673
I make a wish on that bell.

969
01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:38.800
I ring it three times.

970
01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:42.554
but I need to finish
making the wish before night falls.

971
01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:45.057
So. get on it. Make a wish.

972
01:02:45.557 --> 01:02:47.100
- I'll take a photo.
- Okay.

973
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.352
This is cool.

974
01:02:49.645 --> 01:02:51.021
<i>Is it you?</i>

975
01:02:52.022 --> 01:02:54.149
<i>I wish it finally is you. Joseph.</i>

976
01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:02.157
Your turn. Come over here.
I'll take your picture.

977
01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:37.776
Mary.

978
01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:40.195
<i>Atiklaham.</i>

979
01:03:41.864 --> 01:03:46.493
I know you're not yet ready
to say that you love me.

980
01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:48.537
so. <i>atiklaham</i>.

981
01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:50.706
What's that?

982
01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:54.334
If you say it backwards.
it means I love you.

983
01:04:00.215 --> 01:04:01.633
<i>Atiklaham.</i>

984
01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:06.763
Hey. don't I get an <i>atiklaham</i>?

985
01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:10.559
<i>Ecaf ruoy hcnup lli.</i>

986
01:04:11.435 --> 01:04:12.519
What's that?

987
01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:14.730
I'll punch your face.

988
01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:16.565
Oh. come on.

989
01:04:18.066 --> 01:04:19.109
Oh.

990
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:20.819
That's my girl.

991
01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:30.204
- Alright.
- Such a gentleman.

992
01:04:30.996 --> 01:04:32.039
Come in.

993
01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:38.128
Hey.

994
01:04:38.128 --> 01:04:40.088
Careful with your hand.

995
01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:41.840
- Ouch!
- Stop it!

996
01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:46.094
- You're so annoying.
- I was joking. Cool.

997
01:04:46.637 --> 01:04:48.347
- Cool my ass.
- Relax.

998
01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:53.852
Hey.

999
01:04:55.062 --> 01:04:56.688
What do you think you're doing?

1000
01:04:56.688 --> 01:04:58.315
Helping you.

1001
01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:03.362
This is like the scene
from the movie <i>Ghost</i>.

1002
01:05:03.695 --> 01:05:07.866
where the ghost is helping
his girlfriend make a claypot.

1003
01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:11.453
Joseph.

1004
01:05:12.204 --> 01:05:14.081
this is ground beef.

1005
01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:15.582
It's going to turn into burgers.

1006
01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:17.626
not claypots. okay?

1007
01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:19.294
So. get away from me.

1008
01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:21.088
You're really like a ghost

1009
01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:23.715
because you're terrifying me.

1010
01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:28.512
Are you terrified or titillated?

1011
01:05:30.722 --> 01:05:31.723
It's the same.

1012
01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:34.434
Alright. this is for you. Claypot.

1013
01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:47.948
I can't believe it.

1014
01:05:48.407 --> 01:05:50.826
All my dreams are finally coming true.

1015
01:05:51.785 --> 01:05:53.078
And those dreams are?

1016
01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:58.458
This. Burger. Fries.

1017
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:01.211
You feeding me.

1018
01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:05.048
You.

1019
01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:11.889
Okay.

1020
01:06:13.974 --> 01:06:14.975
What is it?

1021
01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:18.103
You're moving too fast!
We're not there yet.

1022
01:06:18.103 --> 01:06:19.730
Sorry. sorry.

1023
01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:24.276
- Okay. alright. alright.
- Alright. alright.

1024
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:25.652
It's your turn.

1025
01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:29.281
- No. No.
- Go.

1026
01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:31.533
I'm going to close my eyes. Go.

1027
01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:36.538
It's your turn. Go. Go ahead.

1028
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:40.292
It's your turn. Don't be shy. Mary.

1029
01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:43.462
Go.

1030
01:06:46.256 --> 01:06:47.257
I'll stop myself.

1031
01:06:51.345 --> 01:06:52.471
You're so cool.

1032
01:06:52.471 --> 01:06:53.972
I'm not that easy.

1033
01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:02.189
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

1034
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.650
<i>It was all a blur.</i>

1035
01:07:05.567 --> 01:07:07.152
<i>Everything happened so quickly.</i>

1036
01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:12.032
<i>Suddenly. you were a part of my life.</i>

1037
01:07:13.909 --> 01:07:16.828
<i>But falling in love is not a choice.</i>

1038
01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:19.998
<i>It's an opportunity.</i>

1039
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.669
<i>And I don't want to waste it.</i>

1040
01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.935
You have a lot of photos.

1041
01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:52.531
I have something to tell you.

1042
01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:56.034
I love you.

1043
01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:58.745
Look at this guy.

1044
01:07:58.996 --> 01:08:01.498
It's only been a month. Love so soon?

1045
01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:05.127
Why not say... What was it you said?

1046
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.671
<i>Atiklaham.</i> That's enough.

1047
01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:09.715
Listen. Mary.

1048
01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:13.427
the first time I saw you
at the <i>pares</i> place.

1049
01:08:14.052 --> 01:08:15.512
I loved you right away.

1050
01:08:19.141 --> 01:08:20.142
It's true.

1051
01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:25.189
Do you believe in soulmates?

1052
01:08:28.192 --> 01:08:29.359
I don't know.

1053
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:38.702
People say you will see your soulmate
only once in your entire lifetime.

1054
01:08:39.494 --> 01:08:42.873
It may be your family. a distant relative.

1055
01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:46.376
a friend. or even a lover.

1056
01:08:48.629 --> 01:08:50.297
When they show up.

1057
01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:52.341
don't let them go.

1058
01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:59.181
Because there's a strong chance
they're never coming back.

1059
01:09:05.062 --> 01:09:07.523
Well. some people also say that.

1060
01:09:08.232 --> 01:09:12.236
in your entire lifetime.
you will fall in love only three times.

1061
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:15.531
Oh? That I don't believe.

1062
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.408
- Oh?
- Don't believe in that kind of crap.

1063
01:09:19.117 --> 01:09:21.787
Fine. How many girlfriends have you had?

1064
01:09:22.079 --> 01:09:24.540
Oh. come on. Nice question.

1065
01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.500
Okay. let me count.

1066
01:09:31.588 --> 01:09:34.132
You won't finish counting if you include
all your invisible girlfriends.

1067
01:09:34.633 --> 01:09:38.428
It's because you're the only one
that I ever took seriously.

1068
01:09:44.726 --> 01:09:45.727
Okay.

1069
01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:48.522
if I'm the first that you took seriously.

1070
01:09:48.522 --> 01:09:50.816
then good luck
on the second and the third.

1071
01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:57.406
You are the first.
the second. and the third.

1072
01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:00.033
Remember this. Mary.

1073
01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:04.329
You are the first
and the last that I will ever love.

1074
01:10:06.999 --> 01:10:08.208
If you love them.

1075
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.628
you chase after them.

1076
01:10:12.754 --> 01:10:14.173
You fight for them.

1077
01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:19.386
It's the same.

1078
01:10:22.681 --> 01:10:23.682
Ouch.

1079
01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:29.730
- It's the same.
- Hey. why are you tearing up?

1080
01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:34.651
You're getting a crush on me
even though we're already a couple.

1081
01:10:36.778 --> 01:10:37.779
Coffee?

1082
01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:40.073
Coffee.

1083
01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:52.085
BEEF STEW- EGG WITH FRIED RICE

1084
01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.422
<i>Is this really how one should love?</i>

1085
01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:02.262
<i>You're ready to give everything
without expecting anything in return?</i>

1086
01:11:10.646 --> 01:11:15.317
<i>You'll take your chance at this other
person without knowing if you'll win?</i>

1087
01:11:16.944 --> 01:11:23.408
<i>What I'm feeling is more
than thrill. nerve. and fear combined.</i>

1088
01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:37.506
<i>But I'm ready.</i>

1089
01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:41.009
<i>I'm ready for you. Joseph.</i>

1090
01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:44.304
Miss Mary. Sir Joseph said to go this way.

1091
01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:47.349
- Where is he?
- How would I know?

1092
01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:34.271
<i>Mary. if I ever fall in love three times.</i>

1093
01:12:34.938 --> 01:12:36.899
<i>you're still the one I will choose.</i>

1094
01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:39.234
<i>Nothing compares to you.</i>

1095
01:12:40.027 --> 01:12:41.195
<i>You are the only one.</i>

1096
01:12:41.862 --> 01:12:43.906
<i>Only you and I are meant for each other.</i>

1097
01:12:45.115 --> 01:12:46.325
<i>I love you.</i>

1098
01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:48.827
I love you. too.

1099
01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.183
Joseph?

1100
01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:14.228
Joseph?

1101
01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:17.791
Joseph?

1102
01:14:24.173 --> 01:14:25.799
Stop the car. I'll drive.

1103
01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:26.925
Come on. Stop the car.

1104
01:14:27.676 --> 01:14:28.677
Joseph!

1105
01:14:33.015 --> 01:14:34.016
Joseph!

1106
01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:37.978
- I'm fine here.
- Be careful. Look!

1107
01:14:40.898 --> 01:14:43.859
Burger one. burger two.

1108
01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:46.111
Oh. Mary. I love you.

1109
01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:52.826
Joseph?

1110
01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:56.413
Hey!

1111
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.089
Joseph!

1112
01:15:16.475 --> 01:15:17.476
Joseph?

1113
01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:46.046
Any news on Joseph?

1114
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.342
His uncle sent a message.

1115
01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:52.219
He finally woke up this morning.

1116
01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:55.681
That's good. Then. why aren't you there?

1117
01:15:56.932 --> 01:15:58.892
Every day. for a week. you were there.

1118
01:15:59.142 --> 01:16:00.894
Now that he's conscious.
you don't want to go?

1119
01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:03.105
Of course I do. but...

1120
01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:06.733
So. how is he?

1121
01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:10.529
He has a broken arm and a broken leg.

1122
01:16:10.529 --> 01:16:12.781
But it'll heal soon enough.

1123
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.993
But his uncle said

1124
01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:19.162
Joseph was acting weird when he woke up.

1125
01:16:19.413 --> 01:16:22.875
And there were things
he could not remember.

1126
01:16:23.959 --> 01:16:25.002
Ah.

1127
01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:28.881
Are you scared?

1128
01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.841
Of what?

1129
01:16:31.466 --> 01:16:33.135
That he won't remember you?

1130
01:16:37.472 --> 01:16:40.184
Go to him. I'll take care of the shop.

1131
01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:42.978
Go on.

1132
01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:56.325
Joseph Carino's room. please?

1133
01:16:56.909 --> 01:16:57.910
Room 28.

1134
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:58.994
Mary.

1135
01:16:58.994 --> 01:17:00.412
Uncle. how is Joseph doing?

1136
01:17:00.412 --> 01:17:02.998
He's okay. I'll leave you to it.

1137
01:17:06.585 --> 01:17:08.045
Has he been given his 2 p.m. medication?

1138
01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:12.549
Hey! How are you?

1139
01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:15.844
Joseph.

1140
01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:18.972
You're the one I should be asking.

1141
01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:20.933
I'm okay.

1142
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.268
It's a good thing I'm still alive.

1143
01:17:24.353 --> 01:17:25.479
It's a miracle.

1144
01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.274
I have some broken limbs.

1145
01:17:30.275 --> 01:17:35.113
but they said I'll be fine
in just a few months.

1146
01:17:35.405 --> 01:17:37.032
But I'm okay.

1147
01:17:38.283 --> 01:17:40.327
I brought you a burger.

1148
01:17:40.327 --> 01:17:42.037
I cooked that myself.

1149
01:17:44.289 --> 01:17:47.251
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

1150
01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:49.127
Why didn't you just buy one?

1151
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:53.298
Because it's for you.
I know my burger is your favorite.

1152
01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:55.467
Is that true?

1153
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:59.805
Yes. and my favorite is your french fries.

1154
01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:01.974
even though it's just fried potatoes.

1155
01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:04.518
Fried?

1156
01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:06.979
Potatoes?

1157
01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:10.482
I cooked for you?

1158
01:18:14.152 --> 01:18:15.988
Joseph. do you remember me?

1159
01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:17.823
Of course.

1160
01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:19.408
Mary.

1161
01:18:20.909 --> 01:18:23.161
Well. the doctor said

1162
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.415
there are some things
that I won't remember.

1163
01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:29.710
It could be permanent

1164
01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:31.545
or not.

1165
01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:34.381
Like. right now.
I can remember who you are.

1166
01:18:34.923 --> 01:18:36.341
You don't remember this?

1167
01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:38.594
This move?

1168
01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:43.265
No.

1169
01:18:44.183 --> 01:18:45.726
- What's that?
- Coffee!

1170
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:51.398
You make delicious coffee.

1171
01:18:51.982 --> 01:18:54.026
You're the one who taught me how.

1172
01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:58.071
- Really?
- First. you grind the beans here.

1173
01:18:58.572 --> 01:19:00.365
then. you put them here.

1174
01:19:01.575 --> 01:19:02.576
add water.

1175
01:19:03.535 --> 01:19:06.788
You're the one who taught me
how to make the perfect coffee.

1176
01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:12.878
Do you remember our favorite song?

1177
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:15.756
No.

1178
01:19:16.632 --> 01:19:17.758
The one that goes...

1179
01:19:17.758 --> 01:19:23.931
<i>And even if the time doesn't come</i>

1180
01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:31.480
<i>That you learn to love me back</i>

1181
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:35.692
You don't remember the painting?

1182
01:19:36.193 --> 01:19:37.569
Are you getting tired?

1183
01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:39.905
Not really.

1184
01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.532
The picture?

1185
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:53.418
<i>Just do not stop me</i>

1186
01:19:54.670 --> 01:20:00.467
<i>From loving you</i>

1187
01:20:03.595 --> 01:20:06.223
You don't remember <i>atiklaham</i>? Me?

1188
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.267
<i>Atiklaham.</i>

1189
01:20:08.767 --> 01:20:11.937
I'm flirting with you. Isn't it obvious?

1190
01:20:13.856 --> 01:20:15.023
You don't remember us?

1191
01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.026
Us?

1192
01:20:21.196 --> 01:20:22.865
We're friends. right?

1193
01:20:24.491 --> 01:20:26.034
I remember that.

1194
01:20:34.293 --> 01:20:35.294
Why?

1195
01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:38.755
Is there something I'm not remembering?

1196
01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:42.176
Is there more?

1197
01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:55.397
<i>You told me you will never forget me.</i>

1198
01:20:56.398 --> 01:21:00.319
<i>You remember me but not us.</i>

1199
01:21:01.737 --> 01:21:03.363
<i>You've forgotten what we had.</i>

1200
01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:09.578
<i>You've forgotten your heart.</i>

1201
01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:32.684
Mary.

1202
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.603
I have something to show you.

1203
01:21:34.603 --> 01:21:36.855
Auntie. I have some good news.

1204
01:21:36.855 --> 01:21:39.107
We're finally opening
our second branch in Manila.

1205
01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:41.985
And if that becomes successful.

1206
01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:43.987
- the rest will follow.
- You closed the deal?

1207
01:21:43.987 --> 01:21:45.781
- Yeah.
- Very good indeed.

1208
01:21:45.781 --> 01:21:48.283
Wait. because it might slip my mind.

1209
01:21:48.825 --> 01:21:52.287
My friend. who just came home from Paris.

1210
01:21:52.287 --> 01:21:53.789
she brought all this stuff.

1211
01:21:53.789 --> 01:21:55.541
I saw this magazine.

1212
01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:58.669
Of course. I couldn't understand
what it's saying.

1213
01:21:58.669 --> 01:22:02.339
Where is it?
There. I thought he looked familiar.

1214
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:05.050
Isn't that whatshisface?

1215
01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:07.970
What was his name again?

1216
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:09.847
- He used to help out in our shop.
-<i>Joseph.</i>

1217
01:22:10.889 --> 01:22:11.932
- That's him. right?
-<i>Five years.</i>

1218
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.561
<i>I tried to forget you.</i>

1219
01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.231
<i>Did you have to give me a sign now?</i>

1220
01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:27.489
<i>I flew to you.</i>

1221
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.324
<i>I searched for you.</i>

1222
01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:32.035
<i>I just wanted to see you.</i>

1223
01:22:33.203 --> 01:22:37.875
<i>Hoping you would still
remember what we had.</i>

1224
01:22:52.556 --> 01:22:54.224
Who are you really?

1225
01:22:54.892 --> 01:22:57.144
- Mary.
- Oh. okay.

1226
01:22:58.687 --> 01:22:59.855
I'm Jojo.

1227
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.773
It's a spitting image.

1228
01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:07.738
<i>But I still failed.</i>

1229
01:23:07.988 --> 01:23:10.407
Marie. stop following me.

1230
01:23:10.866 --> 01:23:11.909
Bye.

1231
01:23:15.829 --> 01:23:17.873
<i>I planned to leave you alone.</i>

1232
01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:23.420
<i>But why does it feel like
fate is playing with us?</i>

1233
01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:26.381
Oh. Marie.

1234
01:23:29.551 --> 01:23:30.761
Joseph.

1235
01:23:31.887 --> 01:23:33.722
<i>Why did we have to meet again?</i>

1236
01:23:35.641 --> 01:23:38.018
<i>You said when you love someone.
fight for them.</i>

1237
01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:49.321
<i>That night. I made a decision
not to give up on you.</i>

1238
01:23:50.322 --> 01:23:51.448
<i>I didn't know if it was right.</i>

1239
01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:58.497
<i>All I know is.
I'm not wasting this chance.</i>

1240
01:23:59.248 --> 01:24:02.084
<i>Maybe this time.
our feelings will be a perfect fit.</i>

1241
01:24:12.302 --> 01:24:13.387
Oh!

1242
01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.597
What happened?

1243
01:24:15.597 --> 01:24:17.891
I saw this song.

1244
01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:19.476
What song?

1245
01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:23.313
That's Rey Valera. He's my favorite.

1246
01:24:23.814 --> 01:24:25.065
This is my favorite song.

1247
01:24:25.816 --> 01:24:26.984
What's up?

1248
01:24:29.528 --> 01:24:30.946
I love you. Marie.

1249
01:24:38.745 --> 01:24:39.872
Ever since.

1250
01:24:39.872 --> 01:24:41.957
I've always loved you. Joseph.

1251
01:25:03.103 --> 01:25:05.856
<i>Look at me again. even briefly.</i>

1252
01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:08.525
<i>Just for a few seconds. Joseph.</i>

1253
01:25:32.216 --> 01:25:35.219
<i>One year. Marie. One year.</i>

1254
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:39.139
It's like your painting is talking to me.

1255
01:25:39.389 --> 01:25:43.185
It's telling me to look away
from my problems.

1256
01:25:43.185 --> 01:25:44.520
I'm proud of you.

1257
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:49.399
It dawned on me. Those horses there
have been running for years.

1258
01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:52.903
Running around. chasing one another.

1259
01:25:53.237 --> 01:25:55.781
To save them from misery. I set them free.

1260
01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:00.577
You're a classic. You're so funny.

1261
01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:02.579
You're crazy.

1262
01:26:02.955 --> 01:26:04.665
Let's just drink.

1263
01:26:05.165 --> 01:26:06.542
I'll get the snacks.

1264
01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:07.918
Sure.

1265
01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:10.337
Let me get some of
my early works. I'll show you.

1266
01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:12.005
Put them in your next exhibit.

1267
01:26:12.339 --> 01:26:13.423
Good idea.

1268
01:26:32.526 --> 01:26:34.528
Can you please give this to him?

1269
01:26:35.279 --> 01:26:36.446
I'm moving on.

1270
01:26:37.114 --> 01:26:38.156
I'm setting him free.

1271
01:26:38.824 --> 01:26:41.159
It's hard to force someone to love me.

1272
01:26:43.495 --> 01:26:46.498
MARY. I WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE YOU
THERE IS NO ONE LIKE YOU

1273
01:27:04.308 --> 01:27:05.392
Marie.

1274
01:27:15.194 --> 01:27:16.320
Joseph.

1275
01:27:26.955 --> 01:27:29.541
I like you.

1276
01:27:48.894 --> 01:27:51.146
<i>- Atiklaham.
- Atiklaham?</i>

1277
01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:54.858
If you say it backwards.
it means I love you.

1278
01:28:05.702 --> 01:28:06.703
Marie.

1279
01:28:06.703 --> 01:28:09.873
<i>It took one year before everything
came rushing back.</i>

1280
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.543
<i>Marie.</i>

1281
01:28:13.919 --> 01:28:15.003
<i>Mary.</i>

1282
01:29:23.614 --> 01:29:25.032
I even calculated it.

1283
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:33.540
I'm so poor at math.

1284
01:29:37.294 --> 01:29:40.047
Our story has taken more than seven years.

1285
01:29:45.469 --> 01:29:47.012
I remember everything now.

1286
01:29:47.846 --> 01:29:48.931
All of it.

1287
01:29:51.433 --> 01:29:53.685
At last. we meet again.

1288
01:29:54.186 --> 01:29:55.187
At last.

1289
01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.273
I still love you.

1290
01:30:04.696 --> 01:30:06.949
I still choose you.

1291
01:30:07.533 --> 01:30:11.203
Now. I can return all the love
you gave me.

1292
01:30:14.206 --> 01:30:16.583
That's no longer what I need.

1293
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:23.048
Maybe it's better

1294
01:30:23.757 --> 01:30:27.094
if we don't bring back our memories.

1295
01:30:30.138 --> 01:30:36.019
Maybe it's better if we accept
that we aren't meant for each other.

1296
01:30:58.667 --> 01:30:59.668
<i>Mary.</i>

1297
01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:02.462
<i>Marie.</i>

1298
01:31:04.006 --> 01:31:05.966
<i>Maybe this is what they call</i>

1299
01:31:05.966 --> 01:31:09.761
<i>fated but not destined.</i>

1300
01:31:12.514 --> 01:31:14.975
<i>Even though fate toyed with us.</i>

1301
01:31:15.976 --> 01:31:18.020
<i>I'm still grateful for that time.</i>

1302
01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:21.815
<i>I will forever choose you.</i>

1303
01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:25.777
<i>Thank you. my heart.</i>

1304
01:31:38.207 --> 01:31:39.499
<i>Joseph.</i>

1305
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.084
<i>Jojo.</i>

1306
01:31:41.919 --> 01:31:44.796
<i>I still believe
that we are destined for each other.</i>

1307
01:31:53.889 --> 01:31:55.641
<i>It might take many seconds.</i>

1308
01:31:56.183 --> 01:32:02.189
<i>minutes. days. weeks. months. or years.</i>

1309
01:32:03.065 --> 01:32:05.234
<i>we might say goodbye over and over</i>

1310
01:32:06.318 --> 01:32:08.820
<i>and hello over and over.</i>

1311
01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.823
<i>but I know that one day.</i>

1312
01:32:11.823 --> 01:32:13.992
<i>fate will give us another chance.</i>

1313
01:32:47.568 --> 01:32:49.361
<i>Persistence of Memory</i>.

1314
01:32:50.112 --> 01:32:52.114
Yes. Salvador...

1315
01:32:52.364 --> 01:32:53.365
Dali.

1316
01:32:54.199 --> 01:32:55.951
Memory. time.

1317
01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:59.663
but it's really just about
melting Camembert cheese.

1318
01:33:09.548 --> 01:33:10.549
Mary?

1319
01:33:12.176 --> 01:33:13.260
Joseph.

1320
01:33:14.052 --> 01:33:15.053
- How are you?
- How are you?

1321
01:33:18.056 --> 01:33:19.349
What are you doing here?

1322
01:33:19.933 --> 01:33:21.101
I bought something downstairs.

1323
01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:24.104
saw this flier.

1324
01:33:24.646 --> 01:33:26.106
and now. I'm here.

1325
01:33:28.066 --> 01:33:29.151
You're really here.

1326
01:33:30.944 --> 01:33:31.945
Let's go.

1327
01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.865
Coffee?

1328
01:33:36.325 --> 01:33:37.451
Let's go. Coffee.

1329
01:34:05.479 --> 01:34:07.439
<i>It's been a while.</i>

1330
01:34:07.689 --> 01:34:09.316
<i>Two years.</i>

1331
01:34:09.983 --> 01:34:11.068
<i>I almost didn't recognize you.</i>

1332
01:34:11.693 --> 01:34:15.239
<i>You look different. Your hair's different.</i>

1333
01:34:15.948 --> 01:34:18.450
<i>You know. when poverty hits.</i>

1334
01:34:19.409 --> 01:34:20.577
<i>You look different too.</i>

1335
01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:22.371
<i>It's the same.</i>

1336
01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:27.501
<i>I missed you.</i>

1337
01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:30.254
<i>I missed you too.</i>

1338
01:38:29.076 --> 01:38:34.915
NOTHING LIKE PARIS
