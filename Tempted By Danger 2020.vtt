3
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.084
Angela?

4
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.643
Nicole:
All I'm saying is we
can do this the easy way.

5
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.104
or we can do this
the hard way.

6
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.897
We prefer to do
it the easy way.

7
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.899
Kyle:
I'd take the deal.

8
00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:49.109
It's a win‐win.

9
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.652
Counsel:
My client did nothing wrong.

10
00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.238
Therefore. we're
not interested
in your offer.

11
00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.240
Client:
Besides. it's crap.

12
00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:57.826
Your client scammed
my client out of
millions of dollars.

13
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.244
and we can prove it.

14
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.079
If you take this deal.

15
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.081
we'll settle for
half the money.

16
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.500
and our client won't
press charges.

17
00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.585
Counsel:
Yeah.

18
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.295
That's not gonna happen.

19
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.465
Guess we're doing
this the hard way.

20
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.718
This is an email
from your client
detailing the scam

21
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.637
to his buddy. John.

22
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.971
Could have been doctored.

23
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.348
Nicole:
These are photos
of your client

24
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.558
meeting with his
co‐conspirator. Alex.

25
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.102
who. oh. did I not
mention this part?

26
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.395
Is waiting in the
office upstairs

27
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.148
and has already agreed
to plead guilty to all
charges.

28
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.609
Kyle:
And testify against
your client.

29
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:31.777
No bid deal.

30
00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.237
And finally.
bank statements.

31
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.282
$12 million to the
Cayman Islands.

32
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.283
Okay. okay.
I get it.

33
00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:39.826
I'll take the deal.

34
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.827
The deal?

35
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:41.995
Oh.

36
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.455
Oh. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:46.667
The deal is no
longer on the table.

38
00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.296
Kyle:
We did!

39
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.506
Boom!

40
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.634
You did it
again. Nicole.

41
00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.511
My Padawan has
become a Jedi.

42
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.805
I'm proud of you.

43
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.473
Thanks. Obi‐Wan!

44
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.393
You were pretty great.
too. for a wingman.

45
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.477
Ooh!

46
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.520
Ouch.

47
00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:08.730
Well. I'm gonna make sure
Glenn and the other partners

48
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.524
know about your nailing this.

49
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:11.441
Who knows.

50
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:12.859
you might just be
the youngest partner

51
00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.319
this firm has ever seen.

52
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.321
Well thanks for
always believing.

53
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.656
Kyle:
Of course.

54
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:18.657
See you.

55
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.700
I'll see you. too.

56
00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:21.785
Joe:
Nicole!

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.833
I really didn't think we'd
ever get that money back.

58
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:28.959
Thank you.

59
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.001
That's what we're here for.

60
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:35.382
Look. I know it's a long shot.

61
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.468
but we're looking for in
house counsel at the company.

62
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.470
Of course we can't pay you
what they do at the firm.

63
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.598
but I can offer you stock.
great benefits.

64
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.518
I promise never to
call you on a weekend.

65
00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.728
What do you think?

66
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:51.314
I'm flattered. really.
but my path is with the firm.

67
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.692
Maybe talk to me in 10 years?

68
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.776
It was worth a shot.

69
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.278
Always.

70
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.912
Good morning.
‐Good morning.

71
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.790
Morning. Padma.

72
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:09.833
Morning. Ange.

73
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.422
Hey!

74
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.215
The new strategist
just popped by

75
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.593
and is wondering if he
can come in and say hi.

76
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:21.720
Oh. yes!

77
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.847
Please. send him in.

78
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.558
Oh. hi!

79
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.893
Hey.
‐Hello!

80
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.102
Michael Langdon.

81
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.729
I wanted to introduce
myself to you in person.

82
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.565
I'm gonna be working with you
on the new Quencher campaign.

83
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.733
Angela:
Oh. I'm‐I'm Angela.

84
00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:35.734
It's a pleasure.

85
00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:36.902
Please. have a seat.

86
00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.737
You have a lovely office.

87
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.988
Thank you.

88
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.866
So. where did you come from?

89
00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:44.701
Well I'm originally
from New Orleans.

90
00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:47.287
but I assume you mean my
last company I was at.

91
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.789
Creative Arts Lab.

92
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.749
Oh. that's a great team.

93
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:51.833
Why'd you leave?

94
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.419
Well. I went to
business school. Stanford.

95
00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.004
Angela:
Impressive!

96
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.547
With such a great pedigree.

97
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.258
why exactly did you decide
to come back to advertising?

98
00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.178
Well. I‐I love it.

99
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.806
It's creative.
uh. strategic.

100
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.098
The people are fun.

101
00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.850
I want to start my
own firm one day.

102
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.143
Well. I will definitely enjoy

103
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.895
working with you
until you do.

104
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.189
If you have any questions.
don't be a stranger.

105
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.148
Oh. I won't.

106
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:16.233
Okay.

107
00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.901
Michael: Thank you.
‐Thank you.

108
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.402
Oh. and. uh‐

109
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.154
Congratulations.

110
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.656
Angela:
Thank you.

111
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:28.995
What did I tell you?

112
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.123
Angela:
Ooh. if I wasn't married.

113
00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.128
Angela:
Partner?

114
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:39.798
Oh my goodness. Nicole.
that is incredible!

115
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.715
Rick:
Nice!

116
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.758
Well. okay. let's not
get our hopes up.

117
00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.468
It may not even
be a reality yet.

118
00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:47.597
My little sister.
the big fancy lawyer.

119
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.933
Now we just need to find
you a suitable husband.

120
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.560
Oh. don't even go there!

121
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:52.811
What?

122
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.479
Dating is normal.

123
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.314
Not dating is not normal.

124
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.441
When is the last time
you've been out with a man

125
00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.485
or even out with your friends?

126
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:01.695
I'm here. aren't I?

127
00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.866
Yes. and you are so
amazing with Ryan.

128
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.410
Don't you want kids
of your own someday?

129
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.662
I get it. you're
focused on your career.

130
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.875
and I am in awe of how
hard you work. but‐

131
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.669
I'm proof you
can have it all.

132
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:18.962
You've been out of
the game for 10 years.

133
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.882
You have no idea what
it's like out there.

134
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.883
These apps. Angela.

135
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.137
There's guys without shirts
sending disgusting photos.

136
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.055
selling teeth whitener
on Instagram.

137
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.515
Wow.

138
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.559
Nicole:
Believe me. being
single's a blessing.

139
00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.103
You just need to find
someone who's on your level.

140
00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.438
Maybe.

141
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.023
Angela:
You need someone
who isn't gonna be

142
00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.150
intimidated by your ambition.

143
00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.902
And the pickings
are indeed slim.

144
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.947
I think I have found
the perfect guy for you.

145
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:46.948
Oh no. what have you done?

146
00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.533
Oh. nothing yet.

147
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:58.168
Nicole:
I cannot believe you
convinced me to come here.

148
00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.628
What? You love art.

149
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.380
Besides. you are gonna thank
me on your wedding day.

150
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.757
Although. I did kinda
have to tell him

151
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.593
it was a work thing
to get him to come.

152
00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.428
So he doesn't know
he's being set up?

153
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.138
Or that I'm not his co‐worker?

154
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.183
Not exactly.

155
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.476
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.729
I‐I cannot believe I
left work early for this.

157
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.607
Listen. I swear I don't
know where everybody is.

158
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.067
I said we were meeting
at eight o'clock.

159
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.069
I must have gotten it wrong.

160
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.236
Baby brain.

161
00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.280
But listen. Michael.
have you met Nicole?

162
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.740
Nicole. Michael.

163
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.325
Rick. come over
here with me.

164
00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.828
I want to show you this
artist that I'm dying to hire.

165
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.205
Really. Angela?

166
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:41.753
All right.

167
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.839
Well. it's nice to meet you.

168
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:46.967
So?

169
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.721
What do you think of Michael?

170
00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.849
Rick:
He's fine. I guess.

171
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.478
But he was kinda rude
to the bartender.

172
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.646
Hm.
‐Yeah. he didn't leave a tip.

173
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.982
Maybe he was just
short on change.

174
00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:05.318
For a guy who wears a Rolex.
he seems kinda insecure.

175
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.487
You did not get
1600 on your SAT!

176
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.280
I don't know what to
tell you. but I did.

177
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.950
That is almost
statistically impossible.

178
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.452
And yet it is
statistically possible.

179
00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.204
I know that because
I did that.

180
00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.248
What'd you get. 1590?

181
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.834
No.
‐ You got 1590. didn't you?

182
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.335
See. I beat you by 10 points.
and you're mad.

183
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.004
Look at you.
‐ No. I'm not.

184
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:25.797
You're competitive. huh?

185
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.007
Nicole:
I'm not competitive.

186
00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.385
Okay. I'm a
little competitive.

187
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.845
Michael:
I can see it.

188
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.681
Nicole:
But. actually. I'm impressed.

189
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:38.018
I don't really meet guys
who are as driven as I am.

190
00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.144
Oh.

191
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.981
Well I don't meet women
who are as driven as I am.

192
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.150
Would you say that
we're equally driven?

193
00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.403
Or that I'm more or less
driven than you are?

194
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.613
Probably more. right?

195
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.657
It's close.

196
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.993
It's as close as
1590 is to 1600.

197
00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.457
Michael:
How 'bout I call
you sometime?

198
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.916
Take you out on a real date?

199
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.173
I think I'd like that.

200
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.340
You sure?

201
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.925
Nicole: Yeah.
‐ Okay. good.

202
00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.727
Chai tea latte half
syrup with almond milk.

203
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.062
Just the way you like it.

204
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:22.812
What are you doing here?

205
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.981
I thought you had a thing.

206
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.149
Wait.

207
00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:27.859
You're beaming.

208
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.819
Did you get a new job?

209
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.071
No.

210
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:33.073
But I did meet someone.

211
00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:33.865
Wow!

212
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.951
Miss Independent met a guy!

213
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.162
And who. pray tell.

214
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.498
has managed to meet
your extremely rigid

215
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.209
and impossibly
high standards?

216
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.585
It's early.

217
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:46.961
I don't want to jinx it
so I'm just gonna say

218
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:51.174
he's a handsome Stanford MBA
who works with my sister.

219
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.884
Kyle:
Really?

220
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.096
Well I won't believe he's real
until I meet him in person.

221
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.013
But I am glad you're here.

222
00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:00.058
because I also have
some exciting news.

223
00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.644
Ooh. did Kyle Jr. pass
his Muay Thai test?

224
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.146
Kyle:
Uh. no. he got
kicked in the head.

225
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.773
But. I did talk with Glenn.

226
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.275
He was really impressed
with your last outcome.

227
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.654
and if you land
Capital Ventures as a client.

228
00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.115
I bet he makes you partner.

229
00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.116
You're joking.

230
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.158
Kyle:
No pressure.

231
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.244
We just have to ace the
pitch dinner with them.

232
00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.954
Oh my god.

233
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.539
Oh my god. oh my god.
oh my god!

234
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.498
You didn't‐

235
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:24.958
You didn't hear that from me.

236
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.584
Nicole:
Maybe my sister was right.

237
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:27.961
Maybe I can have it all.

238
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.465
Hey. Angela.
you got a minute?

239
00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.508
Hey. Michael!

240
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.509
Of course!

241
00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:35.635
What's up?

242
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.928
I got that brief for
the Quencher account.

243
00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:38.346
Thought you might want
to take a look at it.

244
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.515
Quencher? That pitch
is months away.

245
00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:41.975
Too eager?

246
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.810
I'm sorry. I get a little
obsessive when I got an idea.

247
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.311
I can come back in a
few weeks if you want.

248
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.271
Angela:
No.

249
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.313
No. no. no worries.

250
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.149
I like you taking
the initiative.

251
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.108
so let's see what you got.

252
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.151
Michael:
Here you go.

253
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.193
Okay. let's see.

254
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.153
So‐

255
00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.154
Thank you.

256
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.280
Michael:
All right.

257
00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.158
Now. Quencher's really
trying to reach Generation Z

258
00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.284
with this next campaign.

259
00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.327
Now unlike Millennials.
these kids are very cognizant

260
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.329
of the detrimental
effects their cellphones

261
00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.999
and social media
is having on them.

262
00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.960
They make a concerted
effort to carve out time

263
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.837
for person to
person interaction.

264
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.130
Okay. so we do a campaign

265
00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.465
about friends
sharing a Quencher.

266
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.967
No phones. no screen time.

267
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.053
just good
old‐fashioned conversation.

268
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.221
It's old school.

269
00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.264
I like it.

270
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.724
I think it's the way to go.

271
00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.851
Angela:
Okay. Well. I'll have the design
team work on the mock ups.

272
00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.144
and as soon as they're ready.

273
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.271
Padma will call your
assistant and let you know.

274
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.024
I'm actually still
interviewing for that position.

275
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.443
You think you can have Padma
reach out to me directly.

276
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.569
Oh. Will do.

277
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.112
Okay.

278
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.073
Is that a picture
of you and Nicole?

279
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:39.908
Yeah!

280
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.242
You guys always
been so close?

281
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.911
Yeah. we have.

282
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.079
She has always been
taller than me

283
00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.040
even though I'm
the big sister.

284
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.918
She's really.
really protective.

285
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.878
I think it's sweet the way you
two look out for each other.

286
00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.254
Angela:
Yes. it is.

287
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.423
So. don't you screw it up.

288
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.050
Noted.

289
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.219
Though I have no intentions
of that happening.

290
00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.470
Angela:
Good.

291
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.263
All right. I'm gonna
get outta here.

292
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.181
I got a meeting.

293
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.849
Okay. thank you. Micheal.
‐No problem.

294
00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.851
Angela:
Whew!

295
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.399
Is that one of our
spokesmodels?

296
00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.653
No. that was Michael.
our new strategist.

297
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.820
Wow.

298
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.280
I can't keep track
of them all.

299
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.156
Turnover's so high.

300
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.158
Got a minute?
‐Absolutely. come on in.

301
00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:27.789
Nicole Brooks.

302
00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.123
Answering your
phone on a weekday.

303
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.458
I didn't think you
had it in you.

304
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.253
Well. you never know when
a client might be calling.

305
00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.295
Michael:
True.

306
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.296
That is true.

307
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.464
So. um‐

308
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:37.632
As I promised.

309
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.593
how do you feel about going
out on a proper dinner date?

310
00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.304
What if I told you I
had a better idea?

311
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.181
All right. I'm listening.

312
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.482
Now this I did not
expect out of you.

313
00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:55.483
I'm still getting
past the fact

314
00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.151
that you're an
actual gun owner.

315
00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.152
Is that weird?

316
00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.238
'Cause shooting helps
me relieve stress.

317
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.032
Please don't think I'm crazy.

318
00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:03.992
No. no. no.
you're not crazy.

319
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.159
It's not weird.
Nicole: No?

320
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.287
I'm actually a little
turned on by it.

321
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.873
Okay. well let's see if
you can return the favour.

322
00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.250
Oh. I can return the favour.

323
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.672
I am a favour returner.

324
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.090
You ready?
‐ Mmhm.

325
00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.140
That's embarrassing.

326
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.017
At least you hit the target.

327
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.311
Oh. you're loving this.
ain't you?

328
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:32.353
Being the best?

329
00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.396
A little.
‐Yeah.

330
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.398
All right. watch this.
Hold on.

331
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.399
Okay.

332
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:42.780
Oh.

333
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.240
Michael:
Man. I'm only getting worse.

334
00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.326
It's okay.
‐I think it's the gun.

335
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.202
Mm. I don't know.

336
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.288
But it's okay.
I still like you.

337
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.416
I like you too.

338
00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.377
Do you like food?
Do you like to eat?

339
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.670
Of course.

340
00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:00.381
Michael:
I got reservations
at Beast Friday night.

341
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.299
Come with me.

342
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.133
Beast?

343
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.384
Isn't that Michelin starred?

344
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.844
How'd you manage that?

345
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.387
Well I might not
be good with a gun.

346
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.930
but I got other skills.

347
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.059
Okay. I see you.

348
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.477
I wouldn't miss it.

349
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.978
Good.

350
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.314
Excuse me.

351
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.025
Want the scorecard?

352
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.235
Nicole:
Ooh!

353
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.904
I think that's my
first bullseye.

354
00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.238
Um. hello?

355
00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:26.449
No. this is not your
first bullseye.

356
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.408
I got the 10.

357
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.373
Kyle:
Okay. so. we need to
convince these execs

358
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.584
that their current firm is
blowing it by playing it safe.

359
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.710
That's why they're losing.

360
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.462
They need to be
more aggressive.

361
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:40.546
That's my specialty.

362
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.090
That's what I'm counting on.

363
00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:45.134
Oh. by the way. they moved the
dinner up to tomorrow night.

364
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.427
Great!

365
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.553
Uh. wait. shoot.

366
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:48.930
Kyle:
What's up?

367
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.306
I made plans with Michael.

368
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.975
But it's fine.
he'll understand.

369
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:53.976
Kyle:
Sorry.

370
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.269
I had to cancel plans too.

371
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.647
with my wife's best friend
and her husband.

372
00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.482
Darn.
‐Mm.

373
00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:00.316
It‐it's fine.

374
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.193
This is more
important obviously.

375
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.613
Kyle:
Kinda and your partnership
may be riding on it.

376
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.073
Exactly.

377
00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:15.164
It looks great.

378
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.499
I mean. it's good.

379
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.625
But the logo.

380
00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.961
Can we use a font that's a
little bit more youthful?

381
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:21.003
You know. make it pop.

382
00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.213
This is the new generation.

383
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.297
We want that to come through.

384
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.841
Angela:
I'm not mad at that.

385
00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.468
I'll definitely give the
design team that note.

386
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.970
So. on another note.

387
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.680
how are things
going with Nicole?

388
00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:31.889
Michael:
Really well.

389
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:32.765
Your sister's one
in a million.

390
00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:33.891
She's full of surprises.

391
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.143
Angela:
For sure.

392
00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.310
She hasn't made you
meet her for one of those

393
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.895
early morning breakfasts
that she loves?

394
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.021
No. not yet.

395
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.149
But I'm an early riser.
so that works for me.

396
00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.650
Angela:
No thank you!

397
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.068
I believe in sleep!

398
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.028
You know. she's a
workout fanatic.

399
00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.030
She gets up at like 4:30.
5:00 to workout.

400
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.700
She says. "A fit brain is
a smart brain. Angie."

401
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:51.701
Well that's not so bad.

402
00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:52.785
I mean. if you wake up.

403
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.495
roll out of bed and
workout and home.

404
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.621
Angela:
No.

405
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.374
She goes down to that
health club Zenith downtown.

406
00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.918
I'm just so
happy that I'm pregnant

407
00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:03.129
so she cannot drag
me along with her.

408
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.256
Michael:
Okay. well. um‐

409
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.133
I'm gonna‐

410
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.468
I'm gonna get outta your hair.

411
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:11.596
Why don't you relax.
kick your feet up and. um‐

412
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.640
Why don't you put some
heat on that back of yours.

413
00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.184
Another great idea.

414
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:17.393
Thank you. Michael!

415
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:35.828
Hey. cutie.

416
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.413
I just left a meeting
with your sister.

417
00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.790
It's obvious brains
run in your family.

418
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.375
And don't you forget it.

419
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.502
I hope you're working
up an appetite.

420
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.545
I can't wait for our
date tomorrow night.

421
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:45.630
About that‐

422
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.215
I'm going to have
to cancel it

423
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.008
because my very important
new client meeting

424
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.676
got moved to tomorrow night.

425
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.389
Michael?

426
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.768
Are you there?

427
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.479
I am so sorry!

428
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:04.148
I was so looking forward
to seeing you and the food.

429
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.275
Can I take a rain check?

430
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.568
Listen. I'm not gonna
say I'm not disappointed.

431
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.111
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

432
00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:11.614
to get reservations at
Beast on a Friday night?

433
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.074
But. uh‐

434
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.744
I guess with you I'm learning
that work comes first.

435
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.828
Well in this case yes.

436
00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.873
but I still feel
awful bailing on you.

437
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.459
What about the weekend?

438
00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.254
You know what. why don't
we play it by ear.

439
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.922
I'll let you know
when I'm free.

440
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.632
Good luck tomorrow night.

441
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.177
What was that?

442
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.431
Angela:
You blew him off?

443
00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.392
Nicole:
He wasn't angry.
but it was uncomfortable.

444
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.810
Angela:
Oh my goodness.

445
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:41.727
Nicole:
Work will always
come first for me.

446
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:42.728
Beast or no Beast.

447
00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.313
Why'd you?

448
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:45.982
He‐he was taking
you to the Beast?

449
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.441
Are you serious?

450
00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.943
Damn. I would've been
pissed at you too.

451
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.988
Do you know it is impossible
to get reservations there?

452
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.657
Oh. so you're taking
his side now?

453
00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:55.866
We went on two dates.

454
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.118
Be my sister.

455
00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.494
I am your sister.

456
00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.580
I am team Nicole.

457
00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.540
I'm just saying. I would
feel some kinda way too

458
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.959
if a guy always blew
me off for work.

459
00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:06.627
What is this "always" stuff?

460
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:07.336
Oh!

461
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.839
With you it's always always.

462
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:13.175
And at some point you are
going to have to find balance.

463
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.344
I mean. no matter
who you're dating.

464
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.470
Well. there may be
nothing to balance.

465
00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.180
I'm pretty sure I
might have blown it.

466
00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.599
Oh no. really?

467
00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:22.560
Yeah. he seemed fairly
non‐committal after I cancelled.

468
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:23.728
It was weird.

469
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:24.687
But‐

470
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.273
I barely know him. so
maybe it's for the best.

471
00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.650
He's just such a nice guy.

472
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.319
I mean. have you checked
his social media?

473
00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:33.487
Do you guys have
any mutual friends?

474
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.322
Ange?

475
00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.198
You know I hate doing that.

476
00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.534
I pry enough into my
client's lives at work.

477
00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.911
I need to trust my instincts
in my personal life.

478
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:41.912
Hm!

479
00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:42.830
Okay.

480
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.458
Uh uh. And don't
you even dare!

481
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:48.586
Fine.

482
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.463
But do you remember

483
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:53.549
how horrible my first
date was with Rick?

484
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:54.592
Huh?

485
00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:55.968
Crazy!

486
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.386
And do you remember
who encouraged me

487
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.472
to give him another chance.

488
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:01.599
Okay.

489
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.392
Yes. you.

490
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:06.520
And it was the best decision
that I've ever made.

491
00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.481
All I'm saying is why not
give him another chance?

492
00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.232
Do something nice for him.

493
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.984
Make him feel like he matters.

494
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:15.613
All right.

495
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:17.448
Yay!

496
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.574
Nicole:
I'll think about it.

497
00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.701
Right after I've landed
this partnership.

498
00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:23.037
Okay.

499
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.538
Mmhm.
‐Okay.

500
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.614
Michael?

501
00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.283
Nicole.

502
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:02.326
What are you doing downtown?

503
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.786
I thought you
lived in Whittier.

504
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.872
Well I have a meeting with a
client early this morning.

505
00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.541
and I had a couple
passes to this gym.

506
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.084
so I decided to come
by for a workout.

507
00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.168
What do they say?

508
00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.211
"A fit brain brain is a"‐

509
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.337
"Smart one"?
‐Yeah.

510
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.673
Yeah. so very true.

511
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.217
All right. well it's
good to see you.

512
00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:19.885
I'm gonna get back
to this workout.

513
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.262
Okay.

514
00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.641
Hey. Michael?

515
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.101
Mmhm?

516
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.310
Um‐

517
00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.688
I'm really sorry about
flaking on tonight.

518
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.150
My client's dinner
is at Nique.

519
00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.985
which is right beside
my favourite bar.

520
00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.987
Maybe we can grab a drink?

521
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:42.533
I'll either be celebrating
or drowning my sorrows.

522
00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:44.660
Yeah. I'd love that.

523
00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.121
And I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

524
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.581
I. uh‐

525
00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:49.832
I was just really looking
forward to spending time

526
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.251
with you and the food.

527
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.544
Well. I hate to leave.

528
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:55.296
but I can't be late
for this meeting.

529
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.464
Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

530
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.632
I'll text you later
about tonight?

531
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:00.050
Michael:
All right. can't wait.

532
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.218
And. uh. good luck
on your dinner.

533
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.636
Knock 'em dead.

534
00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:03.721
Thanks.

535
00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.580
Nicole:
Hey!

536
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.545
Hey there!

537
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:38.839
Look at you!

538
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.342
Good to see you too.

539
00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.302
Oh!
‐Some vino.

540
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.762
Thank you.

541
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:46.472
Cheers.

542
00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:15.167
Nicole:
Hey hot stuff!

543
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.794
Hey. there she is.
‐Hey.

544
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:19.171
How did it go?

545
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.464
Oh. we killed it.

546
00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:22.633
They loved our take no
prisoners trial strategy.

547
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.927
and they're already
sending over the paperwork.

548
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.638
All right. well let's have a
couple of drinks to celebrate.

549
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.598
Here you go. guys.
‐Okay.

550
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:30.474
Oh!

551
00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:31.767
These look deadly.

552
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:33.644
Manhattan.

553
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:37.648
Here's to Nicole.
for being a legal badass.

554
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:38.732
And here's to
you. Michael.

555
00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.818
for ordering us these
delicious drinks.

556
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:49.994
I feel like I'm so overdressed.

557
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.203
No. you look good.

558
00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:52.580
You're like a single
accessory away

559
00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:54.874
from being an
absolute masterpiece.

560
00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:57.793
Thank you.

561
00:22:58.127 --> 00:22:59.420
Um. well in that case‐

562
00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.924
Let me just add a
little something.

563
00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.180
Mmm.

564
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.643
What do you think?

565
00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:16.854
I think you're beautiful.

566
00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:19.481
Thank you.

567
00:23:20.024 --> 00:23:21.150
It's vintage Hermes.

568
00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:24.403
I bought it with my first
paycheck at the firm.

569
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:26.822
It's one of my most
treasured possessions.

570
00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.908
Well you definitely
have exquisite taste.

571
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:31.911
Thank you.

572
00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:34.330
You want to get a table?

573
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:35.789
Yeah. let's do it.
‐Okay.

574
00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:46.800
Michael:
So what was the guy like?

575
00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:47.801
What guy?

576
00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:49.136
The guy that you were
out for dinner with.

577
00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:52.306
Why would you assume
that the client was a man?

578
00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:57.394
I'll have you know our new
high stakes clients are women.

579
00:23:58.729 --> 00:23:59.730
Maybe you're right.

580
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:01.148
Maybe I shouldn't assume.

581
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.566
No. you shouldn't.

582
00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:05.903
Well. there is one guy.

583
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:06.946
Okay.

584
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.947
Yeah. who's that?

585
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.365
His name is Kyle.

586
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.076
He's my work husband
and he's great.

587
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.369
He's so great.

588
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:14.495
Your work husband?

589
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.996
Yeah.

590
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:20.042
Oops. that went quickly.

591
00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:24.129
Yeah. maybe you shouldn't
have had a drink before dinner.

592
00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:26.882
How'd you know I had
a drink before dinner?

593
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:29.218
You know.

594
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:30.469
Clients are never on time.

595
00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:33.097
Oh. it's so true.

596
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.848
It's so true.

597
00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.977
Are you with me right now?
‐Yeah I am. I'm good.

598
00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.103
How many fingers?

599
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:40.521
I'm gonna have
to get you home.

600
00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:41.855
I'm good.

601
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:43.899
Michael:
You really can
hold your liquor.

602
00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:45.317
Nicole:
Yeah. Yeah. I can.

603
00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:46.568
Okay.

604
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:47.945
Of course I'm fine.
‐All right. just checking.

605
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.574
Well.

606
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.492
This is you?

607
00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:54.994
Yeah.

608
00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:56.745
Michael:
It's cute.

609
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.122
Oh. let me get that.

610
00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:04.044
Well. thank you for
escorting me home.

611
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:05.587
Oh. of course.

612
00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:07.006
I'm a gentleman.

613
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.342
Mm. I hope not too
much of a gentleman.

614
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:13.595
What are you saying?

615
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.392
Watch your step.

616
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.810
Nicole:
Yup.

617
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:45.669
Someone's had a weekend.

618
00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:49.465
Life is just really
beautiful sometimes. you know?

619
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:50.466
Kyle:
Uh‐

620
00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:51.800
sure.

621
00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:54.261
Unless your dog decides to
get into a midnight rumble

622
00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:55.971
with a skunk.

623
00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:56.847
That's tragic.

624
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.140
Kyle:
Mmhm.

625
00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.893
So why's your life
so beautiful?

626
00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:04.146
I spent the entire
weekend with Michael.

627
00:26:05.272 --> 00:26:07.441
I think we're on our way
to becoming a couple.

628
00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.026
Officially.

629
00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:11.153
Congratulations.

630
00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:12.571
Look at you.

631
00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:14.114
Abandoning your work husband.

632
00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:16.909
falling into lust.
making partner.

633
00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:19.495
You really do have it
all going on. don't you?

634
00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:21.038
Making partner?

635
00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.707
What did you hear?

636
00:26:24.792 --> 00:26:26.627
Let's just say the
company's throwing

637
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.128
an impromptu party tonight

638
00:26:28.212 --> 00:26:30.631
to celebrate the new
contract you just won them.

639
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:31.882
You might want to be there

640
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:35.677
because there might
be an announcement.

641
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:37.513
Oh and you know what?

642
00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:39.807
You should bring. um‐

643
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.141
your official guy.

644
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:42.476
I'm sure everyone would
love to meet him.

645
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.477
His name is Michael.

646
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.478
Kyle:
Michael.

647
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.105
Nicole:
And maybe I will.

648
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:52.236
Wow.

649
00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:55.739
Wow. wow. wow. wow. wow.
wow. wow. wow. wow. wow.

650
00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:04.915
I love being so
ahead of the game.

651
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.876
You know. your laser focus
is rubbing off on me.

652
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:10.295
I will definitely run
this up the chain.

653
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.463
Maybe since we're so far ahead

654
00:27:11.547 --> 00:27:14.007
we should just wait for the
official campaign dates.

655
00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:16.093
Angela:
Don't you want to show
people what you're capable of?

656
00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:17.970
Yeah. of course.

657
00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:19.638
Yeah. no. you're right.
you're right.

658
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.848
Angela:
So?

659
00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:22.474
How was your weekend?

660
00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:25.102
Uh. it was good.

661
00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:28.272
Your sister is
some kind of lady.

662
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:29.982
I love new love!

663
00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:34.570
It's just so magical and
full of hope and excitement.

664
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.654
Everything okay
with you and Rick?

665
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:36.655
Huh?

666
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:37.948
Yeah. we're good.

667
00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.324
Just being nostalgic.

668
00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:41.618
You know. things get
hectic when you have kids.

669
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:42.995
That's what I hear.
‐Yeah.

670
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.454
What does Rick do exactly?

671
00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:47.499
He's a stay at home dad.
and he's developing an app.

672
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:48.667
Wow.
‐ Mmhmm.

673
00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:50.210
Stay at home dad.

674
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.880
I'd be worried about Rick
and those stay at home moms.

675
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:53.964
Oh. no. no. no.

676
00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:55.132
That's not Rick's style.

677
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:56.508
Well if you ever
are concerned.

678
00:27:56.633 --> 00:27:59.636
you can always check his cell
phone's locations history.

679
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:00.637
What?

680
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:01.638
Yeah.

681
00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:03.056
Check this out.

682
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:07.978
I heard about this website
called snoggle.timeout.com.

683
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:10.314
Just punch it into somebody's
phone or their computer.

684
00:28:10.439 --> 00:28:13.650
The map on his phone is
linked to his email accounts.

685
00:28:14.193 --> 00:28:16.361
It's honestly a little
creepy and invasive.

686
00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:18.113
Michael:
It's not a breach of trust.

687
00:28:18.197 --> 00:28:20.532
It's just a new way to keep
track of your loved ones.

688
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:21.366
Hm.

689
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:23.660
Know what I mean?
‐Really? Oh. okay.

690
00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:25.996
Well. I'll keep that in mind.

691
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:28.332
Thank you.
‐It's the future.

692
00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:29.416
Oh. um‐

693
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.834
Yeah. I'm late.

694
00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:32.044
I gotta meet your
sister for lunch.

695
00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:33.003
I gotta get outta here.

696
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:35.255
Oh. well you guys have fun.
‐Okay.

697
00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:47.142
since high school.

698
00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:50.395
Have you always been
such a hopeless romantic?

699
00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:53.190
I think I'm just inspired.

700
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.330
Come to my cabin.

701
00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.331
You have a cabin?

702
00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:10.457
Yeah.

703
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.543
Yeah. it's nothing fancy.
but it's‐

704
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.172
It's super private.

705
00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.049
It's a little bit rustic.

706
00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:21.301
I'm down with rustic.
‐Okay.

707
00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:25.472
Want to get on
the jungle gym?

708
00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:26.974
Yeah. let's do it.

709
00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:28.684
I'll race you there!

710
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:37.317
Angela:
You know. I had this weird
moment with Michael today

711
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:38.360
at work.

712
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:41.613
Mixing too much
business with family?

713
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:42.656
No. no.

714
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.032
He‐he pulled out
his cellphone

715
00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:48.495
and showed me this weird
location tracker thing.

716
00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.248
So. did you know that if you're
logged into someone's email

717
00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:53.333
you can track
their every move?

718
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:54.793
Yeah. it's pretty
much common practice

719
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:56.795
in modern
relationships I'm afraid.

720
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:57.796
Angela:
Really?

721
00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:58.797
Rick:
Yeah.

722
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.632
That just sounds creepy to me.

723
00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:03.343
I'm so happy that
I'm not dating.

724
00:30:05.095 --> 00:30:06.471
Do you think he's using it?

725
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.473
I hope not.

726
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.602
You think I should
tell Nicole?

727
00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:16.273
I think that your sister
finally has a good thing going.

728
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.483
And Michael was probably
just trying to impress you.

729
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:20.444
I wouldn't read too
much into this.

730
00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:21.486
So‐

731
00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:23.530
You just think I'm. um. being‐

732
00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:26.658
Overprotective?

733
00:30:26.783 --> 00:30:28.118
Overprotective.

734
00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:31.538
Now can we please stop
talking about Michael?

735
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:34.166
Yes.

736
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.735
Glenn:
May I have your
attention. please?

737
00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:46.363
To Nicole Brooks.

738
00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:49.116
youngest lawyer ever
to make partner

739
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.742
at Royston. Carter. and Klein.

740
00:31:52.035 --> 00:31:53.370
Congratulations.

741
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:54.746
To Nicole!

742
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:55.872
All:
To Nicole!

743
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:56.998
Thank you.

744
00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:57.916
Woooo!

745
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:01.420
Thank you.

746
00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:03.463
Nicole?
‐Thank you so much.

747
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:04.297
Cheers.
‐Cheers.

748
00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:05.841
Glenn:
Congrats.

749
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:20.647
Lisa:
So‐

750
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:21.982
You must be Nicole's guy.

751
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:22.983
It's so nice to meet you.

752
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:23.984
I'm Lisa.

753
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.485
Nice to meet you too. Lisa.

754
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:28.321
You must be something
special to catch Nicole's eye.

755
00:32:28.447 --> 00:32:29.489
Ah‐

756
00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.741
She has the toughest
standards imaginable.

757
00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:34.327
Did you know she once
created a riddle?

758
00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:37.831
Okay. I couldn't even begin
to tell you how to solve it.

759
00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:40.000
but in order for anyone
to go out with her.

760
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.460
they had to solve this riddle.

761
00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:44.171
And it was amazing because
she knew no one would solve it.

762
00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:46.465
you know. except that
one special someone.

763
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.467
Did she make you
solve the riddle?

764
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.509
Michael?

765
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.428
Michael!
‐Hm?

766
00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:52.679
Yeah. What?

767
00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:55.474
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

768
00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:58.059
You look so familiar to me.

769
00:32:58.185 --> 00:32:59.478
Um. I don't think so.

770
00:32:59.603 --> 00:33:01.688
I think I just have one
of those faces. you know?

771
00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:03.482
Yeah.

772
00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:04.983
You do have one
of those faces.

773
00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:06.776
Yeah.

774
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.361
Lisa:
You know what?

775
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:13.742
You look just like my
friend's sister's boyfriend.

776
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:14.701
That's crazy.

777
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.286
Yeah.

778
00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:17.829
But you know. he's a
little bit taller than you.

779
00:33:17.954 --> 00:33:18.997
That's the only difference.

780
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.998
Oh. okay.
‐That's the only difference.

781
00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:21.708
But you know‐
‐Sounds like a good guy.

782
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:25.670
Kyle:
You shouldn't be
nervous tonight.

783
00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:27.005
Hi. Michael!

784
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.007
Um. this is my work
husband. Kyle.

785
00:33:29.132 --> 00:33:30.050
Hey.

786
00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.843
We spend way too
much time together.

787
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.470
Yeah. just ask my other wife.

788
00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:35.222
Ah. that's funny.
that's a good one.

789
00:33:35.305 --> 00:33:37.098
Um. you wanna get outta here?

790
00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:38.391
What? It's only 8:00.

791
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:39.476
Can we stay for a little bit?

792
00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:41.353
Yeah it's her big
night after all. It‐

793
00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:42.646
Yeah. no. I‐I know.

794
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.023
I'm just not feeling.
feeling good at all.

795
00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:46.233
Oh no. are you okay?

796
00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:48.944
I think it was something
in the crab cakes. Um‐

797
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:49.945
Kyle:
Ooh.

798
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:50.946
Michael:
I don't know.

799
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.905
You know what?

800
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.615
You stay. I'm gonna go. okay?

801
00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:55.367
Nicole:
No. no. no. no.
I'll go too.

802
00:33:55.492 --> 00:33:58.245
I should probably quit
while I'm ahead anyway

803
00:33:58.328 --> 00:33:59.746
now that I'm partner.

804
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.041
Um. but we're gonna take off.

805
00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.084
Okay. yeah.
‐Okay?

806
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.210
Bye.
‐See you tomorrow.

807
00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.003
Hey. congratulations. partner.

808
00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.713
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

809
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:13.593
I'll see you around.
‐Yeah. nice to meet you.

810
00:34:28.692 --> 00:34:31.611
Man. I thought life would get
easier after making partner.

811
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:33.738
but it's just work
on top of work.

812
00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:38.535
Which never ends and only
gets worse and then you die.

813
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:41.329
But at least we'll
die together.

814
00:34:43.707 --> 00:34:46.251
I don't know how you
juggle this with a family.

815
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.378
Me either.

816
00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:52.299
So?

817
00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:54.301
What did you think of Michael?

818
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:55.635
Pretty great. right?

819
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.803
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

820
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:57.804
He seems great.

821
00:34:58.847 --> 00:35:01.308
It's too bad you guys
had to leave early.

822
00:35:01.391 --> 00:35:02.517
How's he feeling?

823
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:03.310
Oh. fine.

824
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:04.811
Turns out it was
a false alarm.

825
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.314
Really?

826
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:08.815
Nicole:
Yeah.

827
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:13.069
Angela:
Ah. one down.
another to go.

828
00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:14.154
What does E‐Bank want?

829
00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:15.822
Michael:
Campaign for savings.

830
00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.741
What's the deal with Kyle?

831
00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:18.617
Kyle?

832
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.743
Michael:
Yeah. Nicole's work husband.

833
00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:21.161
What's his deal?

834
00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:22.245
Angela:
You know. they absolutely
enjoy working together.

835
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.371
The feeling's mutual.

836
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:24.539
But I was thinking. what if‐

837
00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:26.541
How long have they
been working together?

838
00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.460
Well. since Nicole
started working there.

839
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:30.337
But I'm pretty sure
he's happily married.

840
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.630
Pretty sure?

841
00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:33.131
Angela:
Okay. honestly. look.

842
00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:34.674
I don't know him like that.

843
00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:38.178
However. he's been
amazing to Nicole.

844
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.180
What are we gonna
do for E‐Bank?

845
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:41.222
Oh. right. yeah.

846
00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:42.307
I‐I came here to tell you

847
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.142
that I'm revising
the brief right now.

848
00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:46.561
I'll come back
when it's ready.

849
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:47.729
Oh. okay.

850
00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:48.980
Hey.

851
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:50.690
Do you remember that photo
that I had over there?

852
00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.150
Yeah. it was cute.

853
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:53.902
Um. I haven't been
able to find it.

854
00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:54.944
Have you seen it?

855
00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.781
No. I haven't but I'll
keep an eye out for it.

856
00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:59.074
Okay. Thank you.

857
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.825
No problem.

858
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:02.744
Hey. Padma.

859
00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:24.182
Michael:
Hey. Rod!

860
00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:25.225
How you doin'. man?

861
00:36:25.308 --> 00:36:26.601
Hey. Michael!
How's it going. man?

862
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:27.560
Michael: Good!
‐Nice to see you.

863
00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:28.728
Michael:
Good to see you.

864
00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:30.522
Rod:
Ah. you didn't have to.

865
00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:31.940
Oh. you're not that good.

866
00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:36.945
Hey. did you catch
the game tonight?

867
00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.655
Ah. disaster.

868
00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:39.614
Brutal!

869
00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:41.116
But don't worry. they're
gonna turn it around.

870
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:42.283
Trust me. I got a feeling.

871
00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:43.827
I hope
you're okay. man.

872
00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:44.828
Have a good night.

873
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:45.829
Take care.

874
00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:46.871
Hello!
‐Hello.

875
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.289
Hi. Oh!
‐ These are for you.

876
00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:50.333
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

877
00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:51.710
Come in. come in.

878
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:56.214
That was incredible.

879
00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.592
I can't believe you
did all this for me.

880
00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:03.138
Well. I thought tonight
should be special.

881
00:37:03.263 --> 00:37:04.597
Oh yeah?

882
00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.976
I got you something.

883
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:09.477
What'd you get me?

884
00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:15.859
I'm a little nervous.

885
00:37:16.818 --> 00:37:17.986
Open it.

886
00:37:21.823 --> 00:37:22.949
You're giving me a key?

887
00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:25.910
Well. a drawer couldn't
fit in the box. so‐

888
00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:29.873
Wow.

889
00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:33.251
I hope I'm not being
too presumptuous.

890
00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:34.335
Is it too soon?

891
00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:35.336
No. no. no. no. no. no.

892
00:37:35.462 --> 00:37:36.337
It's perfect.

893
00:37:36.463 --> 00:37:37.505
And I want to
give you one too.

894
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:39.299
As soon as my renos are done.

895
00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:40.967
you got a key.

896
00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:43.344
Nicole:
More wine?

897
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.763
Please.

898
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.017
I have to be honest.

899
00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:52.937
There is another reason why I
wanted tonight to be perfect.

900
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:54.314
And why is that?

901
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:58.026
Because I can't make it
to the cabin this weekend.

902
00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:02.071
What?

903
00:38:02.197 --> 00:38:03.281
I'm so sorry.

904
00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:05.784
It's just becoming a
partner is way more intense

905
00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:09.412
than I thought it would
be and I'm so bogged down.

906
00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:10.371
It's just for two days.

907
00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:11.623
I mean‐

908
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.833
You need to get away.
I need to get away.

909
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.586
I know. but I'm
really overwhelmed.

910
00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:18.379
We have a huge meeting
with the clients on Monday.

911
00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:19.798
and the trial's next week.

912
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:22.300
Okay. Well. why don't you
bring your work to the cabin.

913
00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:23.635
and you can work
on it there.

914
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:26.596
Well unfortunately we have
a lot of preparing to do.

915
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.681
and I need to be
in the office.

916
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:30.433
We?

917
00:38:31.518 --> 00:38:32.352
Who "we"?

918
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:33.812
Me and Kyle.

919
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:35.814
Oh. okay.

920
00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:37.982
Yeah. I understand.

921
00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:40.026
It's a very exciting
week for you.

922
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.194
I get it.

923
00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:45.990
You sure you're
okay with this?

924
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:46.991
Yeah.

925
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:47.951
Okay.

926
00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:49.077
Thanks.

927
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.373
Yeah.

928
00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:55.708
Here.

929
00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:16.980
Nicole:
I should be really
happy right now.

930
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:18.147
I made partner.

931
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:19.649
I have a gorgeous.
successful boyfriend

932
00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:21.985
who somewhat
supports my career.

933
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:24.487
So why am I still feeling
like something's missing?

934
00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:25.822
Because life isn't
a fairy tale.

935
00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:28.199
and we can both agree that
you strive for perfection.

936
00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:31.494
I know. but something was
off about Michael last night.

937
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:32.996
I just can't put
my finger on it.

938
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.414
He was excited about the key‐

939
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.540
Angela:
The key?

940
00:39:35.665 --> 00:39:36.875
Oh ho! Wow!

941
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.334
Aren't we moving fast?

942
00:39:38.418 --> 00:39:39.919
Maybe.

943
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:42.171
You know. I've never
seen his place?

944
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:44.048
He always has some
excuse to come to mine.

945
00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:45.300
Is that weird?

946
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.593
Angela:
Well. I mean most
guys would rather

947
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:48.303
sleep on their
girlfriend's clean sheets.

948
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:49.387
You know. he kinda shut down

949
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:50.680
when I put off
our weekend away

950
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:53.141
because Kyle and I needed
to focus on the trial.

951
00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:55.852
You don't think he's
jealous of Kyle do you?

952
00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.312
He did ask me how
long the two of you

953
00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:59.439
have been working together.

954
00:39:59.522 --> 00:40:01.232
But listen. Nicole.

955
00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:04.235
You are going to have to
get out of your own way

956
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:06.321
if you want to make room
for love in your life.

957
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.573
Maybe this is just your
way of finding fault

958
00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:09.908
to convince yourself.

959
00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:12.493
I just have more work
to do now than ever.

960
00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:13.745
If I'm a partner

961
00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:15.997
I need to be
concentrating on that.

962
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.874
If I'm unsure about
Michael at all.

963
00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:19.334
he's just a distraction
at this point.

964
00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:22.420
A very good looking
distraction. but‐

965
00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:23.755
Yeah.

966
00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:25.173
Maybe I should put
on the brakes.

967
00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:29.052
Well. work is definitely
gonna be awkward.

968
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:31.304
but. you know. listen.
whatever you decide.

969
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.847
I will support you.

970
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:35.224
I'll shift him over to
another creator director.

971
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.978
He was becoming
my secret weapon.

972
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:40.897
And I was enjoying the view.

973
00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:43.775
I gotta admit.
it was fun.

974
00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:46.945
But I really think I should
tell him how I'm feeling.

975
00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:49.197
Well. just let me
know how it goes.

976
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:13.096
Nicole:
Hey. Michael.

977
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:14.764
Hey. babe. I was just
wrapping things up.

978
00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:16.140
How's it going?

979
00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:17.141
Um. busy.

980
00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:20.269
And just about to
have some dinner.

981
00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.230
Okay. you got enough for two?

982
00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:24.399
Nicole:
Um‐

983
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:26.943
Yeah. listen Michael.

984
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:28.987
I don't know
how to say this

985
00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:33.157
but I think maybe we need
to slow things down.

986
00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.536
What'd you say?

987
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:38.204
Nicole:
Just take a break.

988
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.581
I just have a lot going
on at work right now.

989
00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:42.959
and this trial
is so consuming.

990
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:45.086
I still have so much
to prove. you know?

991
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.797
Youngest partner ever.
it's a lot of pressure.

992
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.632
So you think I'm
holding you back?

993
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:50.842
No. not at all.

994
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:53.970
I just. I can't make you
a priority right now.

995
00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:55.596
And you deserve that.

996
00:41:56.097 --> 00:41:57.515
Is this about the key?

997
00:41:57.598 --> 00:41:58.850
What? No!

998
00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:02.311
Although I do think I
jumped the gun on that.

999
00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.814
Oh. yeah. no. don't worry.
I'm a give it back to you.

1000
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:07.316
So. what. this is
about Kyle then?

1001
00:42:07.442 --> 00:42:09.027
Kyle? Are you serious?

1002
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.156
You know. I knew there was
something going on with you two.

1003
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:15.700
Okay. first of all. Kyle
is like a brother to me.

1004
00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.910
so to insinuate
otherwise is crazy.

1005
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:21.039
Where is this coming from?

1006
00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:24.208
Like. I'm sorry. but you are
completely out of line and‐

1007
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:30.173
Okay. well that went well.

1008
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.324
Hey. Ben. do you
have a minute?

1009
00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:57.825
Yeah. of course. Angela.

1010
00:42:58.367 --> 00:42:59.368
What's up?

1011
00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:01.162
Okay.

1012
00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:03.790
So. I was wondering
if you could maybe

1013
00:43:03.873 --> 00:43:05.166
rearrange the
teams a little bit

1014
00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.376
and move Michael
to a different CD.

1015
00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:09.170
Ah. who's Michael again?

1016
00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:11.839
Michael. he. um. is
the new strategist.

1017
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.049
the one you thought
looked like a model.

1018
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:14.467
all handsome.
‐Oh. right!

1019
00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:16.302
Yeah.
‐Is there a problem?

1020
00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:17.887
No. no. no. no. no. no.
There isn't a problem.

1021
00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:19.013
He's actually great.

1022
00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:21.099
Um. it's more of
a personal thing.

1023
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:23.101
a conflict of interest.

1024
00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:25.645
I kinda introduced him
to my sister and eh‐

1025
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.063
Say no more.

1026
00:43:27.188 --> 00:43:28.648
I'll talk to Steph.
see what she can do.

1027
00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:29.649
Thank you.

1028
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.192
And I'm so appreciative.

1029
00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:32.652
And I promise I'm not
trying to be difficult.

1030
00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:34.070
Hey. you've more than
earned the right

1031
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:35.530
to be difficult. Angela.

1032
00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:36.989
Thank you.

1033
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.291
Nicole:
Okay. so this proves
they went into the deal

1034
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.043
with the intent to
defraud our clients.

1035
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:50.086
Exactly.

1036
00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:52.004
We hammer them on that.
They'll be boxed in.

1037
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:53.965
Okay. I‐

1038
00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:55.383
I like that. Good.

1039
00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:57.426
Hey.

1040
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.427
We're gonna do great.

1041
00:43:58.511 --> 00:44:00.680
I know. I'm just feeling
a little out of my depth

1042
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:02.348
with this trial work.

1043
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.266
Listen.

1044
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:04.392
Glenn wouldn't have
put you on this

1045
00:44:04.517 --> 00:44:07.145
if he didn't think
you were up for it.

1046
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.771
Besides. no one's gonna
be looking at anyone

1047
00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:10.481
but the handsome First Chair.

1048
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:15.278
Oh. yeah.

1049
00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:16.904
You know what.
we should take lunch.

1050
00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:18.197
I gotta meet my wife.

1051
00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.365
Do you want to come with?

1052
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.992
You can call Michael
and make it a foursome?

1053
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:23.202
Oh. actually.
we're on a break.

1054
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.412
Kyle:
Oh. really?

1055
00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:25.413
Are you okay?

1056
00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:26.164
Yeah. I'm fine.

1057
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:29.292
I just need to focus on this.

1058
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:31.544
Okay. well in that case.
we'll celebrate tomorrow

1059
00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.797
after I dazzle everyone
with our opening statements.

1060
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.465
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1061
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:39.051
Give my love to Cindy.

1062
00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:40.511
Kyle:
Always do.

1063
00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.224
Cindy:
Hey. babe!

1064
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:47.435
How's your day?

1065
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:06.037
Um. Padma could you come
here for a moment please?

1066
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:09.332
What up. boss?

1067
00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:10.750
Angela:
Michael doesn't
know this yet.

1068
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:14.128
but I've asked Ben to move him
off of my campaigns if possible.

1069
00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:15.796
Can I ask why?

1070
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.341
Nicole is having
some reservations.

1071
00:45:18.466 --> 00:45:21.636
so she's decided to put
the brakes on things.

1072
00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:24.639
I felt it was prudent to
separate business and personal.

1073
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.266
I always knew he was too
good looking to be true.

1074
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:31.312
Anyway. can you please. um. call
his assistant and reschedule

1075
00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:32.939
the meeting we were supposed
to have for tomorrow?

1076
00:45:33.022 --> 00:45:35.483
Sure but he doesn't even
have an assistant yet.

1077
00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.401
I'm still scheduling
through him.

1078
00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:39.195
Seriously?

1079
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.279
What's his extension?

1080
00:45:40.363 --> 00:45:41.989
Ah. he's still using
his cellphone.

1081
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.658
apparently some
mixup with IT.

1082
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:44.659
Okay.

1083
00:45:44.784 --> 00:45:48.079
Well. please schedule
with him however you can.

1084
00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:49.622
Will do boss.

1085
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.756
Owner:
Yeah. well. no. I
ordered a part.

1086
00:45:58.839 --> 00:45:59.799
it's a water pump.

1087
00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:01.801
could take a week.
maybe two.

1088
00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:02.802
Yeah.

1089
00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:04.262
Yeah.

1090
00:46:04.345 --> 00:46:06.180
Listen. I'll. uh. I'll give
you a call back. all right?

1091
00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:07.640
Yeah. bye.

1092
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.102
Hey.
‐Hey. uh‐

1093
00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:13.354
Lookin' to get an oil change.

1094
00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:14.563
Owner:
Yeah. sure.

1095
00:46:14.689 --> 00:46:16.107
I'm gonna probably need
to keep it overnight.

1096
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.900
Michael:
Any chance I can
get a loaner?

1097
00:46:17.984 --> 00:46:19.568
Yeah. sure.

1098
00:46:19.694 --> 00:46:20.611
Licence. please.

1099
00:46:20.695 --> 00:46:21.654
Yeah.

1100
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:30.830
Thank you.

1101
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.458
All right.

1102
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:36.252
Just sign here.

1103
00:46:43.175 --> 00:46:44.510
Do you have keys?

1104
00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.137
Oh yeah.
‐ Yeah.

1105
00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:53.811
All right. William.

1106
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:54.979
you're all set
with a loaner.

1107
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.522
It's the grey one out there.

1108
00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:59.191
Just return it by
noon tomorrow.

1109
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.484
All right.
Thanks. buddy.

1110
00:47:00.568 --> 00:47:01.569
Yeah.

1111
00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:09.744
Kyle:
I'm certain that
you will agree

1112
00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:14.582
that $10 million is a fair
and accurate compensation.

1113
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.876
Thank you.

1114
00:47:17.793 --> 00:47:19.170
Perfection.

1115
00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:21.839
You make it seem
so effortless.

1116
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.601
Well. I need my beauty sleep.

1117
00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:36.645
and I think we've done
all we can do tonight.

1118
00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:38.564
Music to my ears.

1119
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.816
I'll meet you at quarter
to eight. right?

1120
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.068
Kyle:
Mm.

1121
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:43.486
You're taking that with you?

1122
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:44.737
Yeah. I just want to
take a final look

1123
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:46.197
at everything again.

1124
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:47.823
Of course you are.

1125
00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:50.743
Oh. promise me you'll
get some rest.

1126
00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:51.869
I promise.

1127
00:47:53.662 --> 00:47:54.413
Shoot.

1128
00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.499
I just remembered
I promised Glenn

1129
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:58.209
I'd send him a brief
on the Bowman account.

1130
00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.418
Are you serious?

1131
00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:00.628
Go on. get outta here.

1132
00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:01.420
But I can wait.

1133
00:48:01.504 --> 00:48:02.797
No. no. absolutely not.

1134
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.924
It‐it may take a while.

1135
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:07.635
I just may not be
glowing tomorrow.

1136
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.886
Okay. if you insist.

1137
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.805
I'll see you
bright and early.

1138
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:11.764
Good night.

1139
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:13.224
Good night.

1140
00:49:34.013 --> 00:49:35.639
What happened?

1141
00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:36.974
Oh my god!

1142
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.559
Kyle. you're awake!

1143
00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:40.853
Where's Cindy?

1144
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:43.314
Nicole:
Oh. she's taking the
kids to your sister's.

1145
00:49:43.439 --> 00:49:44.732
She'll be back soon.

1146
00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:48.486
Why do I feel like I've
been T‐boned by a train?

1147
00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:51.322
It was a hit and run
in our parking garage.

1148
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:53.699
We don't know much else.

1149
00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.660
because someone tampered
with the security cameras.

1150
00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.914
Was somebody waiting for me?

1151
00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:03.000
I don't know. but maybe this
has to do with the trial?

1152
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:06.337
Oh god. the trial.

1153
00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:08.797
Nicole:
Yeah. they pushed
it to tomorrow.

1154
00:50:08.881 --> 00:50:09.924
Yeah. I'm no doctor.

1155
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:12.968
but something tells me I'm
not gonna by 100% by then.

1156
00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:15.930
One day is all the
judge would give us.

1157
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.598
even with Glenn's influence.

1158
00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.476
You'll have to take over.

1159
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.186
Nicole:
I'm too green with trial.

1160
00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:23.479
They pulled in Beth.

1161
00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:24.980
Kyle:
You know this
case inside out.

1162
00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:29.985
Beth isn't gonna be able to
learn it in time for opening.

1163
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.362
It needs to be you.

1164
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:32.655
You know that.

1165
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:39.912
I'm gonna go get the nurse.

1166
00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.374
P.A. Announcement:
Dr. Bruce. telephone please.

1167
00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:44.875
Dr. Bruce. telephone please.

1168
00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:51.465
Michael:
Hey. Nicole!

1169
00:50:51.507 --> 00:50:52.466
How you doin'?

1170
00:50:52.508 --> 00:50:54.051
Michael? What are
you doing here?

1171
00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.344
I heard about Kyle.

1172
00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:56.845
Nicole:
How did you even
hear about that?

1173
00:50:57.846 --> 00:50:59.014
I brought flowers.

1174
00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:01.016
Thanks. I'll go
give them to Kyle.

1175
00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:03.644
Michael:
No no. they're not for him.
they're for you.

1176
00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:05.604
Michael‐
‐ Listen.

1177
00:51:06.855 --> 00:51:08.607
I'm sorry I was a jerk
about the cabin thing.

1178
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:10.693
I'm sorry I was a
jerk about Kyle.

1179
00:51:11.277 --> 00:51:12.653
Just forgive me.

1180
00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:14.780
I'll make it up to you.
all right?

1181
00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:17.533
Do you not understand
the seriousness

1182
00:51:17.658 --> 00:51:19.159
of what's going on here?

1183
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:21.078
Yeah. that's why I
got you flowers.

1184
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.748
How can you not see how
inappropriate this is?

1185
00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:27.501
Kyle almost died and
you're at the hospital

1186
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:28.919
trying to win me back?

1187
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:31.422
How can you be so
smart and so stupid?

1188
00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:32.756
I don't want these.

1189
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.549
I don't want us.

1190
00:51:33.674 --> 00:51:35.467
You and me.
we're not a thing.

1191
00:51:35.551 --> 00:51:37.177
So please just go home!

1192
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:58.824
Angela:
Oh.

1193
00:52:03.454 --> 00:52:05.247
Hey. honey.
how are you?

1194
00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:06.457
How's Kyle?

1195
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.042
Nicole:
He woke up. thank God.

1196
00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:09.918
I'm headed to work shortly.

1197
00:52:10.002 --> 00:52:12.004
I can't believe I have to
keep going with this trial.

1198
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:13.464
I'm not sure I can do this.

1199
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:14.590
Angela:
That's understandable.

1200
00:52:14.673 --> 00:52:16.467
Have you even slept?

1201
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:20.638
And I'm concerned about you
if someone targeted Kyle.

1202
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:22.431
You mean is there a
maniac on the loose

1203
00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:24.141
trying to affect the
outcome of the trial?

1204
00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:25.434
Don't worry about me.

1205
00:52:25.517 --> 00:52:27.186
Glenn's hiring
security just in case.

1206
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:28.979
That's a relief.

1207
00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:29.980
Speaking of crazy.

1208
00:52:30.105 --> 00:52:32.441
guess who showed up
at the hospital.

1209
00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:33.484
Angela:
Who?

1210
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:34.652
Michael.

1211
00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:35.736
What?

1212
00:52:35.861 --> 00:52:36.570
How?

1213
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:38.572
Nicole:
It was creepy actually.

1214
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:40.616
How did I miss this?

1215
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:42.493
It's like he won't
take no for an answer.

1216
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:43.661
Angela:
Okay.

1217
00:52:43.744 --> 00:52:45.579
Okay. you know what.
that is not okay.

1218
00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:46.830
Do you want me
to talk to him?

1219
00:52:46.955 --> 00:52:50.209
'Cause I will hammer
home the point.

1220
00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:51.502
No. it's okay.

1221
00:52:51.627 --> 00:52:53.462
I don't want to make things
weird for you at work.

1222
00:52:53.587 --> 00:52:54.713
It's the least I can do.

1223
00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.090
I helped get you
in this mess.

1224
00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:57.466
I have to help get you out.

1225
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:58.759
Nicole:
Okay. thanks.

1226
00:52:59.551 --> 00:53:00.761
Um. I gotta go.

1227
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:03.263
Love you. bye.
‐ Bye.

1228
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:17.820
Glenn:
Are you sure you can handle
opening statements. Nicole?

1229
00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:19.571
The clients are
counting on us.

1230
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:21.699
Yes. 100%. I got it.

1231
00:53:21.782 --> 00:53:22.908
Glenn:
I know I'm going
out on a limb.

1232
00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.035
but. uh. you've never
let me down before.

1233
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.247
Besides that'll give Beth time
to get up to speed on the case.

1234
00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:30.082
I know it's not ideal but‐

1235
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.959
do you have the casework?

1236
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.793
Got it.

1237
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:34.878
Great. I'll let
you two get at it.

1238
00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:38.590
Hi.

1239
00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:40.634
Where do you think
we should start?

1240
00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:43.011
Which section have you
been working on so far?

1241
00:53:44.513 --> 00:53:45.681
Hey. Angela. you
wanted to see me?

1242
00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:47.975
Angela:
Michael. come on in.
sit down.

1243
00:53:50.018 --> 00:53:53.439
So. I just wanted to check on
you with everything going on.

1244
00:53:53.522 --> 00:53:55.607
I'm really sorry that you
and Nicole didn't work out.

1245
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:56.859
Are you okay?

1246
00:53:56.984 --> 00:53:58.360
I'm okay.
thanks for asking.

1247
00:53:58.819 --> 00:53:59.987
She tell you I went
to the hospital?

1248
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.029
She did.

1249
00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:03.407
And that was probably
not the right time

1250
00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:04.783
for a romantic gesture.

1251
00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:05.993
You know. I don't know
what I did wrong.

1252
00:54:06.118 --> 00:54:07.161
You know. I just
wanted to let her know

1253
00:54:07.286 --> 00:54:08.787
that I was always
thinking about her.

1254
00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.247
that I was there for her.

1255
00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:13.709
Right now. Nicole just
needs to focus on her career.

1256
00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:17.004
and she doesn't have time
for anything or anyone else.

1257
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.297
Do you get that?

1258
00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:19.840
Yeah. of course. sure.

1259
00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:20.716
Yeah.

1260
00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:21.675
Don't you think you
deserve someone

1261
00:54:21.759 --> 00:54:23.177
who has more time for you?

1262
00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:27.765
Nicole is just the type of girl
that is married to her career

1263
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:30.142
and there's nothing that
you or I can say or do

1264
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:31.435
to change that.

1265
00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:35.689
Thank you. Angela.

1266
00:54:35.814 --> 00:54:37.024
That's really helpful.

1267
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.442
Yeah.

1268
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:39.485
Padma:
Hey.

1269
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:40.652
I just wanted to remind you

1270
00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:42.446
of your 11:00 a. m.
conference call.

1271
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.531
I'm so sorry.

1272
00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:45.699
I have to take that.

1273
00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:46.742
No. that's fine.

1274
00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:47.701
I have a meeting
downtown anyway.

1275
00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:48.744
Thank you again.

1276
00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:50.078
I really appreciate it.

1277
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:51.330
No problem.

1278
00:54:58.045 --> 00:55:00.714
You know you don't really
have a conference call. right?

1279
00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:01.715
Angela:
I know.

1280
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.217
Thank you.

1281
00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:07.095
What did you say his
last job was again?

1282
00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.723
Um. Creative Arts Lab.

1283
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:12.768
Okay.

1284
00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.354
I'm glad that's done.

1285
00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:23.695
Nicole:
And that is why you'll
see that $10 million

1286
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:26.323
is a fair and
accurate compensation.

1287
00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:28.659
Thank you.

1288
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.285
You have done it
a million times.

1289
00:55:30.369 --> 00:55:32.454
Trust me. Nicole.
you're gonna be great.

1290
00:55:32.538 --> 00:55:33.872
Maybe I should run it again.

1291
00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:36.834
add back in that part
about gross compensation?

1292
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.293
Maybe you should
get some sleep.

1293
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.630
Have you slept at all
since Kyle's accident?

1294
00:55:41.713 --> 00:55:43.006
No. not really.

1295
00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:44.466
Come on.

1296
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:45.968
Let's get outta here.

1297
00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:51.014
If you say so.

1298
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.692
Can you drive her please?

1299
00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:03.443
She's borderline delirious.

1300
00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.239
Hey. do you want me
to take the brief?

1301
00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:08.574
Uh. I got it. really.

1302
00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.534
I just want to review
it one more time.

1303
00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.578
Thanks. Beth.
See you tomorrow.

1304
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.121
Goodnight.

1305
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:15.914
Thank you very much.

1306
00:56:29.678 --> 00:56:31.054
Nicole:
Thank you. thank you.

1307
00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.769
Security:
Okay. have a good night.

1308
00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:40.397
Thank you so much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1309
00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:02.354
Michael?

1310
00:58:03.605 --> 00:58:05.232
Thank god. Man. you had me
scared there for a minute.

1311
00:58:05.357 --> 00:58:07.109
I scared you?
You scared me!

1312
00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:10.654
Sorry. I was trying to be quiet.
I know it's late.

1313
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:11.655
But what are you doing here?

1314
00:58:11.738 --> 00:58:13.198
I thought you and
Nicole broke up?

1315
00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.241
Oh. yeah. yeah.
We did.

1316
00:58:14.366 --> 00:58:16.201
I'm just here to pick
up a few things.

1317
00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.494
She's working all
hours of the night

1318
00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:19.663
ever since she became partner.
you know?

1319
00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:21.123
Isn't that the truth.

1320
00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:23.083
Nice seeing you. man.
Take care.

1321
00:58:23.208 --> 00:58:24.334
Yeah. you too.

1322
01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:50.772
What?

1323
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.487
Oh my god. oh my god.

1324
01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:58.822
Oh no.

1325
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:00.407
Oh my god.

1326
01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:08.999
Hi! Um‐

1327
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.084
When I got out of
my car last night.

1328
01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.170
did I leave the
brief in there?

1329
01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:15.547
No‐

1330
01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.591
Okay. are you sure
it's not in the car?

1331
01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:19.593
Okay.

1332
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:20.802
Okay. thanks.

1333
01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.345
No. no. no. no. no.

1334
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.430
Breathe.

1335
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.974
Why is this happening to me?

1336
01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.434
Oh my god.

1337
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.318
Oh my god.

1338
01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.492
Hey. Padma.
‐ Hey.

1339
01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.036
Just dropping these
files off for Angela

1340
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:47.037
before heading uptown.

1341
01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.205
Okay. I'll make
sure she gets them.

1342
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.664
Michael:
Okay.

1343
01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:50.999
Padma:
Do you need me to
validate your parking?

1344
01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.334
My
car's in the shop.

1345
01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:54.211
I rideshared here today.

1346
01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:55.295
But thank you.

1347
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.296
Padma:
All right.

1348
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.714
All right. take care.

1349
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:30.914
Ah. it's almost done.

1350
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.375
Hey. do you guys. uh‐

1351
01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.293
buy cars too?

1352
01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:36.336
Yeah. sometimes.

1353
01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:37.462
Why. you want to
sell the Beamer?

1354
01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.756
Well what can I get for it?

1355
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.466
It's a couple years old.

1356
01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.718
I could give you
20 grand for it.

1357
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:45.679
20 grand. cash?

1358
01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:46.888
Cash is king.

1359
01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.307
She's all yours.

1360
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.992
Owner:
It's all there.

1361
01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.620
Michael:
Thanks. buddy.

1362
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.920
Glenn:
What do you mean
you can't find it?

1363
01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:19.963
Nicole:
I'm sorry.

1364
01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:20.964
I was tired.

1365
01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:22.799
I don't know. I must
have left it somewhere.

1366
01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:24.426
Beth:
What about the
security guy's car?

1367
01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:25.593
I saw you get in
the car with it.

1368
01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:28.305
I called.
He couldn't find it.

1369
01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.140
Glenn:
Does Kyle have
the backup files?

1370
01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:31.641
Of course!

1371
01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.602
But wouldn't we have to
reveal the security breach?

1372
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.896
Read the opposing counsel's
disclosure documents?

1373
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.190
That's right.

1374
01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.318
If we can't locate the brief.

1375
01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.527
then we have to
inform the judge.

1376
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.529
and if the judge doesn't
dismiss the case outright

1377
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.655
and the defendants
don't waive time.

1378
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.700
we have no choice
but to move forward.

1379
01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:51.745
You've left me no choice.

1380
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.247
Beth. starting tomorrow
you'll take over the case.

1381
01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.582
Get onto Kyle's computer

1382
01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:56.875
and get everything you
can off the server.

1383
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.753
And as far as the disclosure
docs are concerned.

1384
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.671
you're gonna
have to wing it.

1385
01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.214
You're pulling me
from the case?

1386
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.549
I'm firing you. Nicole.

1387
01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.052
We'll be lucky if our
reputation survives this!

1388
01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:34.662
He

1389
01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.081
fired you?

1390
01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.668
I almost died yesterday.

1391
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.838
That's cold.

1392
01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:47.842
Nicole:
Well I pretty much
torpedoed the case.

1393
01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.219
And the company. so‐

1394
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.305
Who knows. you might be
out of a job soon too.

1395
01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:56.434
Well I didn't really
like that job anyway.

1396
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:01.898
Oh god.

1397
01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.110
Come on‐

1398
01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:06.778
Whiskey?

1399
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:07.779
What is this?

1400
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:08.988
Really?

1401
01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.532
I'm unemployed now.

1402
01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:16.871
Oh my god.
I'm unemployed now!

1403
01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.374
Oh. hey. hey. hey. hey.

1404
01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:20.792
No. no. no. come on.

1405
01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:23.962
Hey. come on. it's okay.

1406
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.841
Kyle:
I'm sure he's just panicking.

1407
01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:31.136
Ten bucks says he
calls you tomorrow

1408
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.721
and begs you to come back.

1409
01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.475
Come on. look at me.

1410
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.604
You gonna share some
of that whiskey?

1411
01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:46.943
Only a little.

1412
01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.486
Oh yeah. there we go.

1413
01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.947
With the meds and all.

1414
01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:53.908
Just a little bit.

1415
01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.619
Just give me a little more.

1416
01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:58.955
Come on. what are you.
my mother?

1417
01:05:59.038 --> 01:05:59.956
Come on.

1418
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:03.877
Nicole:
You're gonna get
me in trouble.

1419
01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.838
More.

1420
01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.968
I might as well just
give you the rest.

1421
01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:31.988
Nicole:
I got fired. Angela.

1422
01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.281
They let me go.

1423
01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:34.991
Angela:
What?

1424
01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:35.992
What happened?

1425
01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:39.954
Nicole:
I messed up and lost
the trial brief.

1426
01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.332
This is so humiliating.

1427
01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:43.833
What am I gonna do?

1428
01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.461
Angela:
Oh sweetie.

1429
01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:49.255
I am so. so sorry.

1430
01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.298
Where are you?

1431
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:51.549
Do you need to
come over here?

1432
01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:52.842
No. it's okay.

1433
01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:54.135
I'm at the hospital
with Kyle.

1434
01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.136
I'm just gonna stay here

1435
01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.597
until I have to pack
up my stuff tomorrow.

1436
01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:00.225
I can come get you right now.

1437
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:01.935
No. I'm fine.

1438
01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:03.811
Unless. of course.

1439
01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.939
Michael shows up again
with more flowers.

1440
01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.691
Angela:
Listen. don't joke
about that. okay?

1441
01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:10.860
Rick says you need to
talk to your neighbour Rod

1442
01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:14.155
and tell him that Michael is
not welcome there anymore.

1443
01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:17.200
We need as many sets of
eyes on you as possible.

1444
01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:20.036
Nicole:
Angela. do you really
think he's that unstable?

1445
01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.996
I mean. yeah. the whole
flower thing was a bit crazy.

1446
01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.625
but I can't imagine him
wanting to hurt anyone.

1447
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.252
I just think he can't
handle rejection.

1448
01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:31.047
Honestly. listen.

1449
01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.132
Michael is about
two seconds off

1450
01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.885
of boiling bunnies in
your kitchen. okay?

1451
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.804
So can you please
talk to Rod?

1452
01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.931
Just for my piece of mind.

1453
01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:42.976
If it will make you
feel better I will.

1454
01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.728
Keep your head up high
at the office tomorrow.

1455
01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.814
Call me if you need me.

1456
01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:51.192
And listen. things are gonna
sort themselves out. okay?

1457
01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:52.360
Don't worry.

1458
01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:53.861
I hope so.

1459
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:54.988
Love you.

1460
01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:56.906
Love you.

1461
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.357
Hey.

1462
01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.401
What did you do to Nicole?

1463
01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:35.653
Nicole:
So I guess you heard
what happened.

1464
01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.155
For what it's worth. I
think it's totally B. S.

1465
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.281
that they're firing you.

1466
01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:40.658
especially considering
the circumstances

1467
01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.118
with Kyle and everything.

1468
01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:43.995
Thanks. Lisa.

1469
01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.913
So what are you
gonna do next?

1470
01:08:46.873 --> 01:08:47.874
Nicole:
You know. it's been
a really long time

1471
01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.126
since I have not had a plan.

1472
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:54.797
I think I'm gonna take some
time and think about life.

1473
01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.050
Well. if you need a
character reference.

1474
01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:57.967
just let me know.

1475
01:08:58.092 --> 01:08:59.844
I appreciate that. thanks.

1476
01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.389
Oh.

1477
01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:06.434
I remembered why your boyfriend
looked so familiar to me.

1478
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.145
Ex‐boyfriend. but why?

1479
01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:11.898
Lisa:
He looked just like this
guy my friend used to date.

1480
01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:13.149
but that guy's
name was Todd.

1481
01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.777
Your guy's definitely
Michael. right?

1482
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.236
Yeah. Michael.

1483
01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:18.571
Thank God.

1484
01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.531
because my friend had to get a
restraining order from this guy.

1485
01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:23.701
He started stalking her.
showing up everywhere.

1486
01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:24.827
It was crazy.

1487
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.496
That sounds horrifying.

1488
01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:27.664
Yeah.

1489
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:29.499
Those guys could
be twins though.

1490
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:31.459
Anyway.

1491
01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:32.585
take care.

1492
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.003
Good luck with everything.

1493
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.672
Don't be a stranger.

1494
01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.131
Yeah.

1495
01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:06.786
Hey. Nicole.

1496
01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.995
Jesus! Michael!

1497
01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.665
I'm sorry. I‐I didn't
mean to scare you.

1498
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:11.708
Nicole:
What are you doing here?

1499
01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:12.834
Are you following me?

1500
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:13.751
No. no. I just‐

1501
01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.628
I just came by
to give you this.

1502
01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:16.921
Nicole:
What is this?

1503
01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:19.298
I thought I was clear we're
not getting back together.

1504
01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:21.467
Yeah. that's your‐your key.
the key you gave me.

1505
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.552
I'm giving it back to you.

1506
01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:23.636
Michael. I'm so sorry.

1507
01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.762
I just‐

1508
01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:26.347
I've been exhausted
and things have been.

1509
01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.057
well. kinda crazy.

1510
01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:30.560
I appreciate you
returning this.

1511
01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.061
Thank you.

1512
01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:33.813
Yeah. You know. I just wanted
to do something nice for you

1513
01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.231
since you lost your job.

1514
01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:37.859
Wait. how do you even
know about that?

1515
01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:39.986
Oh. yeah. um‐

1516
01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.195
Nicole:
Oh my god!

1517
01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.823
You know. I've been
trying to give you the
benefit of the doubt.

1518
01:10:43.948 --> 01:10:44.824
I've even been defending you.

1519
01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:46.451
But Ange was right.
you're a creep!

1520
01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.703
And you need to stop following
me and leave me alone!

1521
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.496
Angela said I was a creep?

1522
01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.165
Yes and she's right!

1523
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.333
Now just leave me
alone. please!

1524
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.334
All right.

1525
01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.632
I'm sorry. Hiring M:

1526
01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:44.091
but nobody named Michael Langdon
ever worked here.

1527
01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.468
Are you sure?

1528
01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:47.720
Tall. killer smile.
looks like a supermodel?

1529
01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:51.265
Hiring Manager:
Hm. I think you're talking
about Todd Langdon.

1530
01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:54.393
but we had to fire him after he
stalked one of our assistants.

1531
01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.270
Even broke into
her apartment.

1532
01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:58.397
Why would our company
even hire someone like that?

1533
01:11:58.523 --> 01:11:59.816
Hiring Manager:
Well. if it's Todd.

1534
01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:01.651
I'd be checking to
see if they did.

1535
01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:03.361
Okay. thanks.

1536
01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:19.502
Ben:
Padma.

1537
01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:20.586
I'm looking for Angela.

1538
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.213
Do you know where
I might find her?

1539
01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.257
I think she went home because
of a babysitting emergency.

1540
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.466
Well. would you let her know

1541
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.135
that this new
strategist. Michael.

1542
01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:29.971
that she asked
about transferring.

1543
01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:32.306
I have no idea who
she's talking about

1544
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:33.808
and he's not on the payroll.

1545
01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.351
Are you sure?

1546
01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.811
Ben:
Yeah. Tell her to give
me a call when she can.

1547
01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.521
and we'll get to
the bottom of this.

1548
01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.064
Thanks.

1549
01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.284
Rod:
Hey. Nicole.

1550
01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.702
Hey. Rod.

1551
01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.036
Uh‐

1552
01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.538
You got a minute?

1553
01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:56.455
Rod:
Yeah. sure.

1554
01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.249
What's up?
Are you okay?

1555
01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:01.460
This is gonna sound
a little crazy.

1556
01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:03.170
but you know Michael.
my ex?

1557
01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.380
Rod:
Yeah. yeah. of course.

1558
01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:05.673
He seemed like a
pretty cool guy.

1559
01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:06.716
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1560
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:07.800
Well. actually.

1561
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.385
he's having a hard time
getting over the breakup.

1562
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.138
And honestly. he's freaking
me out a little bit.

1563
01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.933
Can you just keep an eye
out for me around here?

1564
01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:17.643
Yikes. absolutely.
yeah. of course.

1565
01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:18.644
Thanks.

1566
01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:19.687
I appreciate it.

1567
01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.441
And I'm getting these locks
changed first thing tomorrow.

1568
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.653
He got his stuff okay
the other night. right?

1569
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.156
What do you mean?

1570
01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.159
Rod:
Well the night before last.

1571
01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.160
when you were working late.

1572
01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:36.162
he was here picking
up some things.

1573
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.299
Okay.

1574
01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:53.721
Michael.

1575
01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:08.235
Todd Langdon.

1576
01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.241
Oh my god.

1577
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:18.788
Come on. Angela.
Pick up.

1578
01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:26.128
Pick up.

1579
01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.339
Pick up. pick up.
pick up. pick up.

1580
01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.692
Padma. What's up?

1581
01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.026
Is everything okay?

1582
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.319
Padma:
No. Rick. Michael's
not who he says he is!

1583
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.154
I have a very bad feeling!

1584
01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.407
You need to be with
Angela right now!

1585
01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:57.076
Just tell her to stay at
the office til I get there.

1586
01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:58.744
She got your email.
she already left!

1587
01:14:58.869 --> 01:14:59.704
What?

1588
01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.746
What email?

1589
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.081
The email you sent
saying your mom was sick.

1590
01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.916
No. Padma. I never
sent an email!

1591
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.584
I'm gonna call the police!

1592
01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:15.803
Come on. pick up.

1593
01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.138
Come on.

1594
01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.389
Come on. Angela.

1595
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.932
Answer the damn phone!

1596
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.060
Come on.

1597
01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:28.816
Come on.

1598
01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.484
Come on.

1599
01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.409
Hey. Nicole.
How's it going?

1600
01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.703
Nicole:
Why are you answering
my sister's phone?

1601
01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.581
Let me speak to
Angela right now!

1602
01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.583
I believe she's
indisposed at the moment.

1603
01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.293
but if you want to see
your sister alive.

1604
01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.545
you'll get in your car
and you'll come join us.

1605
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.839
No police or she's dead.
you got it?

1606
01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:53.632
Nicole:
Please do not hurt her.

1607
01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:54.550
I'll do whatever you ask.

1608
01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.844
This is between you and me.

1609
01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.638
I'll text you the coordinates.

1610
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.357
Damn it!

1611
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:12.359
God!

1612
01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.731
Angela?

1613
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:56.737
Mom?

1614
01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.739
Mom:
Over here. dear.

1615
01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.491
Is Angela with you?

1616
01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:02.660
No. she's not home
from work yet.

1617
01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:05.454
Lock the door and don't
open it until I get back.

1618
01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.414
Mom: What do you mean?
‐Just lock the door!

1619
01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.036
Hello?

1620
01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.562
Angela?

1621
01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:45.948
What did you do to her?

1622
01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:48.784
Relax.

1623
01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:49.994
She's alive.

1624
01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.328
Nicole:
What did you give her?

1625
01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:52.496
She's pregnant!

1626
01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:54.790
That's the least of
her worries right now.

1627
01:19:59.044 --> 01:19:59.920
What is this place?

1628
01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:01.046
Do you live here?

1629
01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.465
Yeah. it's a bit
of a fixer upper.

1630
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:06.135
I like to call it my
cabin in the city.

1631
01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:08.762
You would know that if
you made time for us.

1632
01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.349
Why did you bring us here?
What are you gonna do?

1633
01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:15.144
I'm not gonna do anything

1634
01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:16.228
to you.

1635
01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:18.188
I love you.

1636
01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.368
The Cleo Awards?

1637
01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:33.620
From last year?

1638
01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.291
But that was before
I even met you.

1639
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.960
It's the first night
I ever laid eyes on you.

1640
01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.213
You were the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

1641
01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.799
It was love at first sight.

1642
01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.801
Nicole:
But you didn't approach me.
ask me out?

1643
01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:50.346
Instead you decided
to wait and stalk me?

1644
01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:51.597
Stalk you?

1645
01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:58.270
It wasn't hard to find
Angela from the event photos.

1646
01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.398
So you got a job with her
company just to get to me?

1647
01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.108
Technically. I
didn't get a job.

1648
01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:06.236
Nicole:
Oh. so you didn't
even work there.

1649
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.782
You really are sick.

1650
01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.993
I was gonna come up with an
excuse to resign after we met.

1651
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.121
It just felt so good
to be working again.

1652
01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.083
Have somebody as
brilliant as Angela

1653
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.292
appreciate my ideas.

1654
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:22.669
I thought at the very
least I'd be able to

1655
01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:25.172
leverage it into
a job reference.

1656
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.926
And now what. you're
gonna get rid of us?

1657
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.095
Michael:
Get rid of you?

1658
01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:34.932
Nicole‐

1659
01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:37.643
I love you.

1660
01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:39.311
I would never hurt you.

1661
01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.065
But there's no telling
what I would do to anybody

1662
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.858
who stands between
you and me.

1663
01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:51.156
Michael if you really love me.
you will not hurt Angela.

1664
01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.952
She is poisoning
you against me.

1665
01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.373
She's got you thinking
I'm creepy and dangerous.

1666
01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:01.834
Who knows how
many other people

1667
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.669
she's trying to
turn against me?

1668
01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.296
That's why we gotta
get outta here.

1669
01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:14.680
Mya MacIntosh.

1670
01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:17.349
You like the photo?

1671
01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:18.767
I feel like I chose
the best one.

1672
01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.352
Here. take it.
take a look.

1673
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.355
You want us to
leave the country?

1674
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.648
Michael:
Yeah.

1675
01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:27.192
You really believe
you can pull this off.

1676
01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.403
I sold everything I own!

1677
01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:33.490
My condo. my car.
my damn Rolex!

1678
01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.867
I liked that watch!

1679
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:38.495
After I sell this building.

1680
01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.082
which I can do outside
of the country.

1681
01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:44.710
we'll have more than
enough to live on

1682
01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.378
for a long time. Nicole.

1683
01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:48.630
And Angela?

1684
01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:49.965
Oh. that's gonna be
a little complicated

1685
01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.925
to bring her along with us.

1686
01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:53.719
I'm not going
without Angela.

1687
01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:57.014
Nicole‐

1688
01:22:58.265 --> 01:22:59.308
this is only gonna work if
you're a willing participant.

1689
01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:00.350
all right?

1690
01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:03.145
That's always been the
problem in our relationship.

1691
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.771
It's always gotta
be about you.

1692
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.899
I need you to be on my
team right now. okay?

1693
01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:12.237
You're right. Michael.

1694
01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:18.243
I have been selfish
and insensitive.

1695
01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.245
but you don't have
to hide anymore.

1696
01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.789
because I've been denying
my feelings for you.

1697
01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:28.420
You have?

1698
01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:29.880
Nicole:
Yes.

1699
01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:32.466
Honestly. I'm‐

1700
01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:35.385
I'm glad you
sabotaged the trial.

1701
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:40.182
I'm grateful I lost
the job because

1702
01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:41.517
now that I've had some
distance from it.

1703
01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:43.393
I can see what I
really needed.

1704
01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:47.064
You've shown me that love is
more important than anything.

1705
01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.276
See. that's what I've
been saying.

1706
01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:53.654
You're finally
seeing it my way?

1707
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.282
Now I can focus all
my energy on you and us.

1708
01:23:58.158 --> 01:23:58.992
Michael:
Okay. but what about Angela?

1709
01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:00.452
Because. you know. she‐

1710
01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:03.830
If somebody asks
her what happened.

1711
01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:05.832
they're gonna come
looking for me.

1712
01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:09.044
No. Michael.

1713
01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:12.089
Angela will never get in
the way of my happiness.

1714
01:24:12.172 --> 01:24:13.298
She always has my back.

1715
01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:15.259
Remember. it was her
idea to set us up.

1716
01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:18.387
Yeah that's true.
she did‐

1717
01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.225
Oh my god. oh my god.
oh my god!

1718
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:24.977
Oh my god. oh my god.
oh my god!

1719
01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.478
Are you okay?
‐Yes.

1720
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.147
Oh. he's moving. he's moving.
he's moving!

1721
01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.108
You're not going anywhere.

1722
01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:33.527
Michael‐

1723
01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.320
Please listen to me.

1724
01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:36.446
Put the gun down.

1725
01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.867
What are you gonna do.
you gonna shoot me?

1726
01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.120
Put the gun down. Michael!

1727
01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:52.963
I thought you
loved me. Nicole.

1728
01:24:57.342 --> 01:24:58.468
I still love you.

1729
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.140
Angela.

1730
01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:06.143
We made a good team.

1731
01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:22.951
Rick:
It's okay.

1732
01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:24.453
It's all over.

1733
01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:26.538
Angela:
How?

1734
01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:41.511
Child:
Wait. where are you going?

1735
01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:42.638
Child:
To kick it.

1736
01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.097
Nice kick.

1737
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:45.682
Girl:
You don't know
how to kick it!

1738
01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:47.142
Let's see.

1739
01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:47.893
Oh!

1740
01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:50.687
You are the best
auntie ever!

1741
01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.314
Thank you so much.
I love it!

1742
01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:54.650
Well. he's just the
cutest baby ever!

1743
01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.568
Aren't you. sweetheart?

1744
01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.320
Say. "Thank you. Auntie!"

1745
01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:01.323
Listen. this is about you.
this whole party.

1746
01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.450
You are the one
with the new job.

1747
01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:04.826
Kyle:
I still can't believe

1748
01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:06.703
you're not gonna be
my work wife anymore.

1749
01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.956
And that you're leaving
me for that guy.

1750
01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:11.708
Nicole:
Hey!

1751
01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.627
He's a touch on
the mature side.

1752
01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:16.922
But seriously though.

1753
01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.674
Are you sure we can't
entice you to come back?

1754
01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:21.051
I'm sure you could squeeze
Glenn for a lot more money.

1755
01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:23.470
He feels really bad
about everything.

1756
01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:26.556
I think it's time for a change.
but thank you.

1757
01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:29.601
Who's that guy?

1758
01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:33.730
Hi.
‐ Hi.

1759
01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.190
I'm Michael.

1760
01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:35.941
Rick.

1761
01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.150
Yeah. I‐I work with Joe.

1762
01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:38.610
Rick:
Oh. okay. okay.

1763
01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:40.404
Angela:
Look. I didn't do it.

1764
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:41.196
I didn't invite him.

1765
01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:43.490
I swear. my set
up days are over.
