Have fun at school. okay?

31
00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.500

Good. Here you go.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.533
Have a good day. Bye.

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.600
Jimbo. let's go.

36
00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:09.734
Gotta go. Bye!

37
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.467
Say your last goodbye. boys.

38
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.500
See ya. girl.

39
00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:39.500
Be safe.

40
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.233
- Excuse me?
- Hey.

41
00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:10.467
Hey. Sorry to bother you.
but are you throwing this away?

42
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.633
Yeah. Hate to see her go.

43
00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.100
She's been a good friend.

44
00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:15.133
"She"?

45
00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.633
Old Betty.

46
00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:18.500
- You name your grills?
- Oh. yeah.

47
00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.667
We had a lot
of good times together.

48
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.200
but I just a new Grill Master
to replace her.

49
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.500
Well. does
Old Betty still work?

50
00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.133
She's seen better days.

51
00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.266
Huh.

52
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400
Grill Master 750.

53
00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:31.266
Compatible with
a 20-pound hopper.

54
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.633
center-barrel ignition--

55
00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:33.834
I don't know.

56
00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:35.133
Seems kinda cruel

57
00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:36.867
to throw a nice old lady
like this to the curb.

58
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.834
You mind if I take her?

59
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.500
Wow. you know your grills.

60
00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:40.567
Well. I've never named one.

61
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.567
but I've flipped a burger or two
in my time.

62
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.834
I'm Gia.

63
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.367
Gianna. actually.
but Gia for short.

64
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.433
Jim Dunlap. James. actually.
but Jim for short.

65
00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:51.767
Just moving?

66
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.367
I am. yeah.
A few blocks over.

67
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.333
Just doing the last
of my moving loads.

68
00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:57.333
Nice. Well. welcome
to the neighborhood.

69
00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:58.533
Thank you.

70
00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.867
Uh. can I interest you
in a Parker Boyle Deluxe 1400

71
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.834
day crib?

72
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.600
Oh. so you name
your furniture. too. huh?

73
00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:06.233
Lizzy's my daughter.

74
00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:07.600
Just thought I would bring it
out front here.

75
00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:10.333
Seems it will go faster
than in front of my house.

76
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:11.667
Lizzy. that's a cute name.

77
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.367
Cuter kid.

78
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.600
Yeah. I don't doubt it.

79
00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:18.734
Anyway. I'm--
I'm good on cribs.

80
00:04:18.867 --> 00:04:20.767
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

81
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.200
no takebacks.

82
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.800
You sure you want to take this?

83
00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:25.667
I don't know if you'll get
this thing started again.

84
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.900
Won't get it started again?
Wanna bet?

85
00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.700
Oh. you don't want to do that.
I never turn down a bet.

86
00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:32.433
Yeah. me neither.
What's our wager?

87
00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.333
Ten bucks?

88
00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:35.333
20.

89
00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:36.533
Deal.

90
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.533
You're on.

91
00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:39.533
Well. in that case.

92
00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:40.900
I should help you
load it up in your truck.

93
00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:42.200
Oh. sure. that would be great.

94
00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.200
Uh. Mo. want to give me a hand?

95
00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.166
Yeah.

96
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.700
She's taking
Old Betty off our hands.

97
00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:47.800
Oh. lucky gal!

98
00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:49.800
Luckier grill.

99
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:55.033
Okay. One. two--

100
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:01.233
Thank you so much!

101
00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.500
Hey. no problem.

102
00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:08.934
So. what area
are you moving into?

103
00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.300
You said close by. right?

104
00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:11.333
Lakeside.

105
00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:12.533
I'm Lakeside.

106
00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.000
and the house right next to me
just sold. actually.

107
00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:16.700
Seriously?

108
00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:17.934
Always. 20748?

109
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.433
Well. hello. neighbor!
Literally.

110
00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:24.300
Well. um. yeah. if you ever
need any help with your grill.

111
00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:25.867
or if you want to get
rid of it. "neighbor."

112
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.900
just let me know.

113
00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:28.567
Like I said. not likely.

114
00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:32.734
Uh. hey. I'm actually
having a barbecue

115
00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:33.834
at my place this weekend.

116
00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.533
Be a good way to meet
some of the neighbors.

117
00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:36.667
get to know
some of my colleagues.

118
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.266
You should come by.

119
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.867
Yeah. I'd like that.

120
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.867
Great.

121
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.333
- See you then.
- What can I bring?

122
00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:44.467
Yourself.

123
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.000
All right.

124
00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:47.367
See you then.

125
00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:54.500
So when are you taking her
out to dinner.

126
00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:55.900
this new friend?

127
00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:57.700
Ah. new neighbor.

128
00:05:58.734 --> 00:05:59.734
Right.

129
00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:04.700
I'll take that.

130
00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:32.500
Well. hello. new neighbor.

131
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.033
All right.

132
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.867
Now how am I gonna get you down?

133
00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:02.367
- Hi.
- Hi!

134
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.467
I'm Karen Wagner.

135
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.734
I live just down the lake.
two houses over.

136
00:07:05.867 --> 00:07:06.900
I didn't mean to interrupt.

137
00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:08.867
but I just wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

138
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.700
That's so sweet of you.
And fast.

139
00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:14.066
Oh. yes. well. these
were actually for a bake sale.

140
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.066
I made a few extra.

141
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.734
so it is a little bit
of a cheat.

142
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:17.834
Well. thank you.

143
00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:19.467
I'm Gia. by the way.

144
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.433
Oh.

145
00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.033
Oh. did--
did you want to come in?

146
00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:25.700
I thought you'd never ask.

147
00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:30.000
Ohh...

148
00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:31.700
Wow.

149
00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:33.133
Oh. Tell me

150
00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:34.700
these aren't

151
00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:36.000
to die for.

152
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:37.133
Mm!

153
00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:38.433
Yes!

154
00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:39.600
They are to die for.

155
00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:41.133
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

156
00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:42.800
Oh. I love how open
your kitchen is.

157
00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:44.967
I would love to get
an open concept like this.

158
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.934
but it's a little hard to save
on a firefighter's salary.

159
00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.934
- Oh. you're a firefighter?
- No. not me. my husband is.

160
00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:52.100
I'm a designer.
You know. houses and offices.

161
00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:54.100
I love color.
That is my thing.

162
00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:57.367
Oh. You have great taste.

163
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.834
Well. I was a designer.

164
00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:02.166
until the company
I worked for downsized.

165
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.533
and I'm still not working.

166
00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:05.066
But. you know. I am thinking
of starting my own firm.

167
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.166
so that's kind of exciting.

168
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.700
But enough about me!
Tell me about you.

169
00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:10.467
What do you do?
You work?

170
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.734
Uh. yeah. yeah. I work.
- For...?

171
00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.133
The city. Parks department.

172
00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.200
Parks department?

173
00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:15.500
Well. that sounds interesting.

174
00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:16.500
Kinda.

175
00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:18.700
So. what brings you here?

176
00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:19.767
The job.

177
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.633
and. well. I needed a change.
a fresh start.

178
00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:23.867
so to speak.

179
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.533
Break-up?

180
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:26.667
Something like that.

181
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.700
So why come to the burbs
on the lake.

182
00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:30.767
instead of the city.
where all the action is?

183
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.233
I mean. if I was single--
you're single. right?

184
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.633
I could tell!

185
00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:38.867
I would be mowing the grass
on the other side of the fence.

186
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.867
if you know what I'm saying!

187
00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:45.734
Yeah. well. I...
I just got tired of renting.

188
00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:49.433
and living lakefront felt like
what I needed right now.

189
00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:51.900
Plus. the price on the house
was right.

190
00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:53.200
Well. you picked
a nice neighborhood.

191
00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:54.900
Good people!

192
00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:56.633
Now "Tykee"--
oh. that's his nickname--

193
00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:58.467
he lives about five doors down.

194
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.233
he is a little quirky.
but generally harmless.

195
00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:03.767
And then there is Liz Hassle.

196
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.133
now she's a bit of
a chatty Cathy.

197
00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:06.934
so don't get cornered by her.

198
00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:08.867
because she will literally
suck the life out of you.

199
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.166
I am serious. we had
this sweet little old man.

200
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.200
he lived down the street.

201
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.533
He literally died
while talking to her.

202
00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:15.800
Literally! Hmm!

203
00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:17.633
Okay. well. I'll be careful.

204
00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:20.633
I. uh. I did meet
Jim the other day.

205
00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:23.200
Oh. you did?
Oh. Jim's great!

206
00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:25.200
He is Mo-- that's my husband--
his best friend.

207
00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.667
and they work together.

208
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.266
Oh. well. I met him
at the firehall.

209
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.000
Oh. well. maybe you saw my Mo.
then-- big guy. Cute.

210
00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:35.667
Almost as cute as Jim.

211
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.066
Ah.

212
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.567
Almost forgot.

213
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.567
Fresh break-up.
I get it.

214
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.033
Men are not on your radar.

215
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.166
Well. Jim's a single dad.

216
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.600
He has an adorable
little daughter named Lizzy.

217
00:09:46.734 --> 00:09:49.567
and she's best friends
with our daughter. Julia.

218
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.667
Oh. Well.
maybe you can help me.

219
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.266
I'm actually developing

220
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.266
a new children's playground
for the town.

221
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.133
Maybe you can tell me
what things are her favorite?

222
00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.533
Well. Jim and Lizzy might
be able to help you with that.

223
00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:02.734
Our Julia.

224
00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:06.066
she can't use the children's
parks in this town.

225
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.500
You daughter can't use
a kid's park?

226
00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:09.900
I've never heard of that before.

227
00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:11.900
Oh. Julia has cerebral palsy.

228
00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:15.266
And she's still hitting
some of her major milestones.

229
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.100
but keeping her balance
and posture isn't possible.

230
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:19.133
I'm so sorry.

231
00:10:19.266 --> 00:10:21.533
Oh. no need to be sorry!

232
00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:23.100
Our Julia is...

233
00:10:23.233 --> 00:10:25.600
well. she's perfect
in every way.

234
00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:28.500
But a typical playground

235
00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:30.333
is not made
for kids like her.

236
00:10:31.734 --> 00:10:33.900
That's...
That's really unfortunate.

237
00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.834
It is.

238
00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:36.900
Hey.

239
00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.600
You take your time
getting over your breakup

240
00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:42.200
and the healing of your heart.

241
00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:44.133
and remembering
from years gone by--

242
00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:46.967
oh. it's the worst.

243
00:10:48.367 --> 00:10:49.633
Thank you. I will.

244
00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:53.266
And thank you
for this warm welcome. really.

245
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.867
Oh. it's my pleasure!

246
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.834
It's gonna be so nice
to have a new face around here.

247
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.233
Oh!

248
00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:02.266
Jim's having a barbecue
this weekend.

249
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.633
You should come.

250
00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:05.667
He actually already invited me.

251
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.066
Did he. now?

252
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.066
Well. well...

253
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.133
well. all right.

254
00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:12.967
I'm not gonna poke you
about it anymore.

255
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.033
Later. 'gator!

256
00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:16.233
Bye!

257
00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:18.033
Bye.

258
00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:28.333
Mm. Hmm. hmm.

259
00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:30.200
I just don't get it.

260
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.734
What's wrong with a normal park?

261
00:11:32.867 --> 00:11:34.633
Well. nothing. except
the town already has six.

262
00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:36.333
but an inclusion playground--
there isn't one.

263
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.033
Look. look. Do you see
the teeter totter here?

264
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.767
It has a seat with a strap.

265
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.700
And the swing set
will have the same thing.

266
00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:44.166
So...

267
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.600
all of it's padded?

268
00:11:45.734 --> 00:11:47.834
Yes. everything is to spec
from Inclusion Playgrounds.

269
00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:49.834
It is such a great program.

270
00:11:49.967 --> 00:11:51.700
I can't believe more cities
and towns aren't doing this.

271
00:11:51.834 --> 00:11:52.767
Well. it's because

272
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.000
most town councils
think it's too expensive.

273
00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:57.066
Well. with
a little outside funding.

274
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.700
it actually saves them money.

275
00:11:58.834 --> 00:11:59.900
Oh. is that so?

276
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.400
Well. why don't you just
draw me up a full prospectus.

277
00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:03.800
and I can take it
to council. yeah?

278
00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:06.066
Okay! On it.

279
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.967
But you'll have to find
a lot for it.

280
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.700
What about the one
that you were considering

281
00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:12.233
for the regular
playground proposal?

282
00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:14.834
Yeah. I haven't come up
with anything yet.

283
00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.934
Oh. Okay. Well.
I've been researching a few.

284
00:12:17.066 --> 00:12:18.367
so I can circle back

285
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.800
when I figure out
which ones work.

286
00:12:19.934 --> 00:12:21.767
Sure.

287
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.266
Get me that prospectus. yeah?

288
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.133
Great. And the link for this
should be in your inbox

289
00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:27.133
for further review.
if you want.

290
00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:28.100
Great.

291
00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:29.300
And. uh. finally...

292
00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:31.867
nice to finally
meet you in person.

293
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.100
Welcome to town...

294
00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:34.633
and to the job.

295
00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:36.734
Thanks. Don.

296
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.934
I just don't understand

297
00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.934
why you couldn't have found
a house closer to home.

298
00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.834
My new job is here. Mom.

299
00:12:51.967 --> 00:12:53.367
I wasn't gonna
commute eight hours.

300
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.233
Well. then why couldn't you
find a job closer to home?

301
00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:59.000
You know. look. honey.
I know how hard this has been.

302
00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:00.867
and all the more reason

303
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.967
you should be close
to the people who love you.

304
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.367
My whole world was wrapped
around his world. Mom.

305
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.767
His friends-- everywhere I went.
there they were.

306
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.166
And I know it was always
with the best intentions.

307
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.233
but I just--

308
00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:15.467
I can't have
everyone feeling sorry for me

309
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.467
all the time.

310
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.000
I needed this.

311
00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:22.300
We just hate to think
of you being alone. sweetie.

312
00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:24.967
I know. I know. and I love
you and Dad for that.

313
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.367
but the truth is.
I felt more alone at home.

314
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.000
I like it here.

315
00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:36.266
Mom. hold on a second.
I'll call you back. okay?

316
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.900
Love you. sweetheart.

317
00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:41.266
I'm only a phone call away--
don't forget that.

318
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.700
Well. hello there.

319
00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:46.967
Hi. Here.
These are for you.

320
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.200
Oh. aren't these beautiful?

321
00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:50.934
My dad helped me pick them.

322
00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:52.266
He did. did he?

323
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.367
Now. let me guess...

324
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.200
you must be Lizzy?

325
00:13:58.066 --> 00:13:59.767
Well. this is very thoughtful
of you. Lizzy.

326
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.834
I'm Gia.

327
00:14:00.967 --> 00:14:01.900
Nice to meet you.

328
00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:03.433
My dad also

329
00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:06.433
wanted me to remind you
that the barbecue started.

330
00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:07.800
Would you like to come?

331
00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:09.033
I sure would.

332
00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.800
How about I put these
in some water

333
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.200
and then
you can show me the way?

334
00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:14.500
Okay.

335
00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:17.266
Hold on two secs.

336
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.567
Do you know how to dancece?

337
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.667
Whoo!

338
00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:28.567
1.250-square-inch.
40-pound hopper.

339
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.100
dual-intake ignition.

340
00:14:30.233 --> 00:14:31.934
- Dual?
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:14:32.066 --> 00:14:33.567
It's a thing of beauty. man.

342
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.600
You deserve it.

343
00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:35.900
Thanks.

344
00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:37.166
"Thing of beauty."
indeed. Jimbo.

345
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.200
I'm really gonna have to have
a talk with Karen.

346
00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.000
Mine's three years old now.

347
00:14:41.734 --> 00:14:43.133
I thought she was six.

348
00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:45.333
Not our daughter. Janelle.

349
00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:46.500
The barbecue.

350
00:14:46.633 --> 00:14:47.867
Barbecue's three.

351
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.967
- Oh.
- Yeah.

352
00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:51.233
All right.

353
00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:52.333
I'm gonna take these
up to the kids.

354
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:54.200
Enjoy.

355
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.266
Hey. You made it.

356
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.033
Escorted here
by the chair

357
00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.633
of the neighborhood-welcoming
committee.

358
00:15:03.767 --> 00:15:05.033
Good job. kiddo.

359
00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:06.166
Julia's upstairs. playing.

360
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.033
She's waiting for you.
You wanna take this?

361
00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:09.233
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

362
00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.233
- Bye. Lizzy!
- Bye.

363
00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:12.967
You were right.

364
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.266
She's adorable.

365
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.333
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

366
00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:17.400
Right.

367
00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:18.934
I didn't know
what your favorite was.

368
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:20.266
so I just went
with my favorite.

369
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.000
Oh! Pink lemonade.

370
00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:23.233
Just happens to be
my favorite. too.

371
00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:24.467
Oh. well. good choice. then.

372
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.967
Wow!

373
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.400
I love your deck.

374
00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:29.000
It's like a... an oasis.

375
00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:30.633
Yeah. the job can be
kind of hectic.

376
00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:33.233
so it's nice to kind of build
a little paradise at home.

377
00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:34.567
Oh.

378
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.667
Hey. everyone! Can I get
your attention. please?

379
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.533
This here is Gianna Summers.
she's our new neighbor.

380
00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.300
Gia. everyone.

381
00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:42.500
Hey. everyone!

382
00:15:42.633 --> 00:15:44.100
Hi!

383
00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:45.400
Are all your neighbors
firefighters?

384
00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:46.567
Some of them
just got off shift.

385
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.567
so invited them over.

386
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.600
but. for the most part.
we're all family.

387
00:15:49.734 --> 00:15:50.667
Howdy. howdy.

388
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.033
I'm so glad you made it.

389
00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.166
Me too!

390
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.166
Mo!

391
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.400
Gia. I want you to meet Mo.
my husband.

392
00:15:57.533 --> 00:16:00.333
Friends call him "Big Mo."

393
00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:02.233
Ah. Parents were fans
of Three Stooges?

394
00:16:02.367 --> 00:16:04.333
Nailed it! And yes.
Middle school was brutal.

395
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.333
Well. it is nice
to officially meet you. Big Mo.

396
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.633
Jim. Mo. and the crew
helped load my new grill

397
00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:10.667
into my truck
at the station.

398
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.667
Ah.

399
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.400
"New" is a little bit
of a stretch.

400
00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:15.233
Oh. just wait and see
what I can do with her.

401
00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:16.667
Ah. Can I get you something?

402
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.967
Pink lemonade on the rocks?

403
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.000
- Pink lemonade would be great.
- Comin' up.

404
00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:22.433
Mm. Let me guess.

405
00:16:22.567 --> 00:16:24.100
Taurus?

406
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.467
"Taurus"?

407
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.300
- Karen's really into astrology.
- Mm.

408
00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:29.266
Thought it was kind of weird
when we first met.

409
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.367
but now I think
it's kind of cute.

410
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.633
Mm!

411
00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:35.500
- Well. I am actually a Taurus.
- Knew it!

412
00:16:35.633 --> 00:16:37.333
So intuitive.

413
00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:38.433
Mm.

414
00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:41.567
Oh. okay. okay.
enough with the P.D.A.

415
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.266
These two have been married
for. like.

416
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.500
- 10 years. and they can't--
- 12.

417
00:16:45.633 --> 00:16:47.033
- 13. baby.
- I knew that.

418
00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:48.100
Mm.

419
00:16:48.233 --> 00:16:49.700
...13 years. and still
act like newlyweds.

420
00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:53.700
Uh. so. are you gonna show me
what replaced Old Betty?

421
00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:56.433
Yes! I will.
Come this way.

422
00:16:56.567 --> 00:16:58.500
- Talk to you later!
- Bye.

423
00:17:00.533 --> 00:17:02.133
So. they're your best friends?

424
00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:03.433
Yeah. And a godsend.

425
00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:05.667
They help out with Lizzy
all the time when I'm on shifts.

426
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.667
What's the saying?

427
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.767
"Takes a village"?

428
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.300
Boom. That one.

429
00:17:11.767 --> 00:17:14.700
Grill Master 1250.
Cast iron.

430
00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:16.233
40-pound hopper.

431
00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:17.266
Dual ignition?

432
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.133
Whew. She's a beaut!

433
00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.400
What'd you name her?

434
00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:21.600
"New Betty".

435
00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:23.033
How original.

436
00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.333
Got an 1150 myself.
40 burgers at once.

437
00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:27.700
Ever seen that before?

438
00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:29.633
The 40 burgers
or the grill?

439
00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:31.266
Both.

440
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.166
Uh. no. I can't say I have.

441
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.767
Janelle Munson's the name.

442
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.066
Wow. That is
a strong handshake!

443
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.333
Jim tell you
about our fundraiser?

444
00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:40.667
- Uh...
- Uh. no. I have not.

445
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.400
Janelle. I just met Gia.
She's new to the ar--

446
00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:45.133
Colleague of ours.
passed away recently.

447
00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:47.133
Got a GoFundMe page
started for his family.

448
00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:48.467
T.J. Haislet.

449
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.033
Great man. Missed.

450
00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:53.100
Any help you can offer
would be appreciated.

451
00:17:53.233 --> 00:17:54.166
I am so sorry to hear that.

452
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.100
and. yes. I will
definitely check it out.

453
00:17:56.233 --> 00:17:58.100
Excellent! Got an email?

454
00:17:58.233 --> 00:17:59.133
Uh. yes.

455
00:17:59.266 --> 00:18:00.700
Got a phone?

456
00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:02.100
Yep. I got that. too.

457
00:18:02.233 --> 00:18:03.700
Gonna pull it out?

458
00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:05.133
Oh.

459
00:18:05.266 --> 00:18:06.767
Uh... yes. Yeah.

460
00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:11.500
Okay.

461
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.400
And zapped ya.

462
00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:13.800
Now my contact's
in your contacts.

463
00:18:13.934 --> 00:18:14.734
So. text me.

464
00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:16.433
Will do.

465
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.433
Oh. Right now?

466
00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:19.834
Never a better time
than the present.

467
00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:21.333
'Kay. yep.

468
00:18:30.367 --> 00:18:33.367
Whoo! "Holy crow"
is my middle name.

469
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.233
Hey. what's going on
over there?

470
00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:37.700
Don't worry.
I got some for you. too.

471
00:18:37.834 --> 00:18:41.367
It's not. really.
It's Barb-- father's mother.

472
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.166
Not for "Barbecue."
like one might think.

473
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.133
Ahh. Tch.

474
00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:48.500
These two
are my unofficial taste-testers.

475
00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:51.400
Mm! Oh. you have outdone
yourself this time. Jimbo.

476
00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:52.667
Might be the best yet.

477
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.533
You want to try?

478
00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:55.800
'Course I do.

479
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.200
Mm. Not bad.

480
00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:02.633
Jim is the five-year champion.

481
00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.433
The champion of what?

482
00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:08.333
Uh. Labor Day
County Barbecue Contest.

483
00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:09.400
Duh.

484
00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:11.767
The most prestigious
barbecue contest ever.

485
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.400
"Prestigious"?

486
00:19:13.533 --> 00:19:15.367
Whatever comes off Jim's grill

487
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.333
is off-the-charts.
amazingly. exquisitely.

488
00:19:18.467 --> 00:19:20.800
mouth-wateringly great.

489
00:19:20.934 --> 00:19:23.166
They brag about it!

490
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.266
A lot!

491
00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:26.700
Well. it is good.

492
00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:29.200
Curious. Have you ever thought
of adding a little cinnamon?

493
00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.500
Sometimes. I even
go a step further

494
00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:32.333
and I dice up some limes.
stick 'em in the foil.

495
00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:34.333
Gives it
that extra perfect kick.

496
00:19:34.467 --> 00:19:36.367
Oh. you know your grills.

497
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.233
Yeah. I've been told
I'm not bad.

498
00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:40.200
Especially with vegetables.

499
00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:41.200
Vegetables?

500
00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:41.900
Oh?

501
00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:43.567
Interesting.

502
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.233
Do you guys
make your own sauce?

503
00:19:45.367 --> 00:19:46.333
Is the sky blue?

504
00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:47.367
Okay. well. you got me there.

505
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.533
It's usually Mr. Stubbs
for me.

506
00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:49.800
From a jar?

507
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.567
- Ho!
- Okay hold on. hold on.

508
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.667
Don't give the lady
a hard time.

509
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.166
Clearly. she's confident
about her grilling.

510
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.834
I sure am!

511
00:19:57.967 --> 00:19:59.667
You smell that. Mo?

512
00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:02.700
I smell a challenge.

513
00:20:04.367 --> 00:20:05.400
Oh. you sure do.

514
00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:07.500
- Ooh...
- Ooh!

515
00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:09.934
Did you tell Jim
about the children's playground

516
00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:11.700
you're building?
She works for the city.

517
00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:12.900
Ah.

518
00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:14.633
I actually-- I wanted
to talk to you about that.

519
00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:15.834
After our chat the other day.

520
00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:18.767
I made some changes
to the proposal.

521
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.433
It's now
an inclusion playground.

522
00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:21.867
Are you serious?

523
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.934
Yeah! Yeah.

524
00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:24.934
I spent all of last night researching

525
00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:27.567
and I flipped
the proposal entirely.

526
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.700
Wow! That sounds like
a pretty awesome thing.

527
00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:32.266
I mean. Julia would
absolutely love that.

528
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.500
Well. consider her
the inspiration

529
00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.633
behind the changes.

530
00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:37.800
My boss. Don Hamilton.
is reviewing it right now.

531
00:20:37.934 --> 00:20:39.433
Don Hamilton.

532
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.700
What? We're--
We're not fans of Don's?

533
00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:45.934
It's not that we're not fans
of Don. but...

534
00:20:46.066 --> 00:20:47.266
Speak for yourself. Jimbo.

535
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400
All Don cares about

536
00:20:48.533 --> 00:20:50.166
is who can put the most dollars
in his pocket.

537
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.600
Really? How so?

538
00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:52.867
Well. we've been
trying to get him

539
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.433
to give us approval to build
a gym for our firefighters.

540
00:20:55.567 --> 00:20:56.867
in our back lot
behind the station.

541
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.834
But it's been two years.

542
00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.367
and every time we think
we're getting approval.

543
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.567
there's more "red tape."
like he likes to put it.

544
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.433
So don't count on your park.
is all I'm saying.

545
00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:06.533
Unless. of course.

546
00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.233
you got a major donation
for his Mayor candidacy.

547
00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:11.967
Or his snack stash.
Man's a glutton for the snacks.

548
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.500
What?

549
00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:14.967
He loves to snack.

550
00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:18.367
Well. maybe
I can try and help.

551
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.967
Any chance I could come by
and check out the parking lot?

552
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.700
How's Monday?

553
00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:24.233
It's a date.

554
00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:25.934
Great. Well. let's get
this barbecue started

555
00:21:26.066 --> 00:21:27.734
before the food gets cold.
all right?

556
00:21:27.867 --> 00:21:30.600
- All right!
- Sounds good.

557
00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:32.500
Let's go. buddy.

558
00:21:32.633 --> 00:21:34.867
I'm starving!

559
00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:43.066
Oh. hi. Gia.

560
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.000
What can I do for you?

561
00:21:44.133 --> 00:21:45.433
I just wanted to say

562
00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:47.066
how excited my team is
about the inclusion playground.

563
00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:49.800
Right!

564
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.367
Right. Yes.
I'm gonna need that prospectus.

565
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.800
Yes. We are working on it.

566
00:21:53.934 --> 00:21:56.066
So hey. I met some of the crew
from our local fire station

567
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.667
and they mentioned something

568
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.433
about needing a gym
for the firefighters.

569
00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:02.133
Something about
their parking lot?

570
00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:04.633
Ah. That's our parking lot.

571
00:22:04.767 --> 00:22:06.467
You know. city property.

572
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.467
They already have
plenty of real estate

573
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.433
for that. uh. fancy new
renovated firehall of theirs.

574
00:22:13.567 --> 00:22:14.800
I see.

575
00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:16.867
Curious why that land
wouldn't work for them. though.

576
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.834
as it's not being used.

577
00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:18.834
Is there another bid on it

578
00:22:18.967 --> 00:22:20.400
- or something?
- Another bid?

579
00:22:20.533 --> 00:22:21.767
There's plenty of bids.

580
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.467
Oh. I see.

581
00:22:24.533 --> 00:22:26.767
Eh-- ah...

582
00:22:27.834 --> 00:22:29.033
Look at this.

583
00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:30.533
But our land
for the playground--

584
00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:31.633
that's safe. right?

585
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:32.767
Look.

586
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.834
Everyone is bidding
on everything. all the time.

587
00:22:34.967 --> 00:22:36.000
Nothing's in the bag.

588
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:38.633
Oh. Okay. I just--
I thought that was a done deal.

589
00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:40.133
I thought it was
about assigning a lot.

590
00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:41.400
Gia. Gia.

591
00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:42.834
Look. I'm gonna be straight
with you. okay?

592
00:22:42.967 --> 00:22:44.667
It's all about the funding.

593
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.633
Now. you get me the funding.

594
00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:49.033
and I'll get you the land
for your. um. you know.

595
00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:50.633
"Inclusion playground."

596
00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:52.100
The inclusive park.
That's right.

597
00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:54.500
Okay. Well. uh. how much?

598
00:22:54.633 --> 00:22:55.734
How much to guarantee it?

599
00:22:55.867 --> 00:22:57.367
- 100k.
- Seriously?

600
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.200
Well. the good news is
I'm assigning you to it. right?

601
00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:02.934
So. nothing's gonna stop you
from raising the money.

602
00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:05.567
Right. Okay.

603
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.066
Well. what about
the firefighters. then?

604
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.000
Maybe I could
take that on as well.

605
00:23:10.133 --> 00:23:11.200
help them
with their fundraising?

606
00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:12.533
I mean. we all know
they're underfunded.

607
00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:14.834
Isn't everyone?

608
00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:16.633
But would it be okay
to help them?

609
00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:18.734
You know. as long as
you make a point

610
00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:20.033
of letting the Chief know.

611
00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:21.600
The Fire Chief?

612
00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:26.266
Yeah. that we're making
an effort to help them.

613
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.667
Here.

614
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.934
Have a poster.

615
00:23:35.767 --> 00:23:36.900
Right.

616
00:23:45.567 --> 00:23:47.200
All right. people.
stay safe out there.

617
00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:52.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

618
00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.934
I'm looking for Jim.
I'm guessing this is a bad time.

619
00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:56.166
Uh. no.
he's not on this call.

620
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.900
Chief Reed.

621
00:23:58.033 --> 00:23:59.567
Gia. I'm Jim's new neighbor.

622
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.133
Oh. Nice to meet you.

623
00:24:01.266 --> 00:24:02.266
He's. uh. around back.

624
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.533
Oh. great.

625
00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:07.567
Oh. uh. Don Hamilton.
from Parks and Rec...

626
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.700
What about him?

627
00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:09.900
He's my boss.

628
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.166
and. uh. he actually
has given me permission

629
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.767
to help you guys with
the gym you've been needing.

630
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.000
Oh. he did. did he?

631
00:24:15.133 --> 00:24:16.000
Mm-hmm. yeah.

632
00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:18.600
He wanted me
to let you know.

633
00:24:18.734 --> 00:24:19.900
Yeah. I bet he did.

634
00:24:20.033 --> 00:24:24.567
Listen. any help you can offer.
we'd greatly appreciate.

635
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.000
I'll lead the way.

636
00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.867
Great.
Just let me grab something.

637
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.166
So. how long have you been
working for Don Hamilton?

638
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.266
I actually just started.

639
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.734
Whoo!

640
00:24:39.867 --> 00:24:41.600
Jim? You got a visitor.

641
00:24:41.734 --> 00:24:43.500
Oh. look who it is.

642
00:24:43.633 --> 00:24:45.233
- Hey.
- Came to drop off Old Betty?

643
00:24:45.367 --> 00:24:46.667
Ah. I'd just roll her

644
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.800
over to your place.
if that was the case.

645
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:49.800
I actually came by

646
00:24:49.934 --> 00:24:51.600
because I wanted
to share some good news.

647
00:24:51.734 --> 00:24:54.100
- And to give you this.
- Oh?

648
00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:55.900
As a thank-you
for the invite the other day.

649
00:24:56.033 --> 00:24:57.266
It was so nice getting to know

650
00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.033
your friends and everyone
in the neighborhood.

651
00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:00.767
A cookbook for the grill?

652
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.867
Jim should be making
his own book for the grill.

653
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.767
Hey. Eye on the prize. Janelle.
Eye on the prize.

654
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.133
Ah. zip it. Barbie.

655
00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:07.867
Okay. well. anyway.

656
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.600
the good news is

657
00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:11.667
my boss gave me permission
to help you guys out.

658
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

659
00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:14.567
To be honest.
it felt a little bit

660
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.934
like a consolation prize
for the fact

661
00:25:16.066 --> 00:25:18.300
that he still hasn't guaranteed
the playground proposal.

662
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:19.633
He didn't guarantee it?

663
00:25:19.767 --> 00:25:21.700
But that's your boss
and it's a city project.

664
00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:23.800
Sounds like
it's about the money.

665
00:25:23.934 --> 00:25:25.033
Again-- about the money.

666
00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:27.333
Yeah. so I guess I'm gonna
have to do some fundraising

667
00:25:27.467 --> 00:25:28.767
to guarantee it.

668
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.900
Well. whatever help you need.
you can count us in.

669
00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:31.967
Thank you. I will.

670
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.300
So. your gym--
tell me about it.

671
00:25:34.433 --> 00:25:35.967
It's cold

672
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.200
and concrete.

673
00:25:37.333 --> 00:25:39.633
And non-existent.
as you can see.

674
00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:41.800
We lost the gym
when we did our renovations

675
00:25:41.934 --> 00:25:43.133
and we haven't had one since.

676
00:25:43.266 --> 00:25:44.266
And as you can see.

677
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.333
we've been making do

678
00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:47.834
with makeshift spots
around here.

679
00:25:47.967 --> 00:25:49.800
And a local gym.
that won't suffice?

680
00:25:49.934 --> 00:25:51.200
Pilates studio count?

681
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:53.633
- Where Mo is a regular.
- And the Pope's a woman.

682
00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:55.200
Should be.

683
00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:56.867
The answer's no.

684
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.133
We don't have a local gym.

685
00:25:58.266 --> 00:26:00.367
The closest one
is the next town over.

686
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.900
Okay. and so this is

687
00:26:02.033 --> 00:26:03.633
the parking lot
that you want to do it in?

688
00:26:03.767 --> 00:26:04.867
Yeah. that's right.

689
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.633
Why didn't you do it
in the renovation?

690
00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:08.967
It's officially the city's land
and we don't have approval.

691
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.867
Needed this space for our trucks
and essential gear.

692
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.700
Why didn't you get approval?
That seems so odd. no?

693
00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.166
Mm. you could say. maybe.
it's an old rift

694
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.033
between the firefighters
and Don Hamilton.

695
00:26:18.166 --> 00:26:19.934
It's his third year
running for Mayor.

696
00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.800
and the Chief won't give him
our support.

697
00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:23.934
He thinks that's the reason
why he keeps losing.

698
00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:25.100
I see.

699
00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:27.400
You know. Karen actually
made the designs

700
00:26:27.533 --> 00:26:28.667
for the gym...

701
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.233
which we might never get.

702
00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:32.333
With a color palette
that includes turquoise--

703
00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:33.967
that I hope we never see.

704
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.200
Hey. Karen likes turquoise--

705
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.266
a color which
could actually complement

706
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.934
your charming personality.
I might add.

707
00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:40.033
Hey.

708
00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:42.066
But I'm sure Karen
would just love to help you

709
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.734
with your designs.
if you needed her to.

710
00:26:43.867 --> 00:26:45.133
Yeah. at the very least.
we can help you

711
00:26:45.266 --> 00:26:47.734
with the inclusion park--
fundraising for it.

712
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:50.000
We love what you're doing.
and it's for a good cause.

713
00:26:50.133 --> 00:26:51.033
and it's well needed.

714
00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:52.166
We would love
to get behind it.

715
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.934
Thank you! That's amazing.

716
00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:56.734
And I'll poke around and see
if I can get you guys your gym.

717
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.133
Joining forces.
I like this.

718
00:27:00.266 --> 00:27:03.033
On one condition--
the challenge.

719
00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.166
Oh. the barbecue challenge?

720
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.367
That's right.
We still need to talk about--

721
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.000
Oh-oh. we got to go.

722
00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:09.734
Yeah. of course.
We'll talk.

723
00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:11.166
Well. hopefully.
sooner than later.

724
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.867
- Yeah.
- Hey. Jim.

725
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.934
You can come this way.

726
00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:30.967
So do you have any ideas?

727
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.166
I do.

728
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.033
Don gave me approval
- for a 10-
- K race

729
00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:37.133
and the city's gonna
help promote it.

730
00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:38.266
Ooh.

731
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.734
Well. I've never been
much of a runner.

732
00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:41.066
but hey.
I'll try anything once.

733
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.166
Thank you.

734
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.800
Did you see the movie
"Promising Young Woman"?

735
00:27:44.934 --> 00:27:46.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Inspo for the nails.

736
00:27:46.133 --> 00:27:47.033
Nice!

737
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.934
Speaking of inspiration.

738
00:27:49.066 --> 00:27:50.767
I wanted to ask you--

739
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.800
when you first told me
about your idea for the park.

740
00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:55.300
and I told you
about Julia having CP.

741
00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:56.300
I felt like...

742
00:27:56.433 --> 00:27:58.800
maybe you have a...

743
00:27:58.934 --> 00:28:01.433
connection to it.
or you're familiar?

744
00:28:01.567 --> 00:28:02.934
Maybe you know someone?

745
00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:05.900
Yeah. you're right.
I am familiar with it.

746
00:28:06.033 --> 00:28:07.834
Huh. Hey! Let me do yours next.

747
00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:09.867
Sure. Why not?

748
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.400
You were saying?

749
00:28:12.533 --> 00:28:14.867
My-- My sister-in-law.

750
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.900
Ex-sister-in-law.

751
00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:18.867
She has cerebral palsy.

752
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.867
Ex-sister-in-law? Hmm.

753
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.867
Still a sensitive subject?
I get it.

754
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.500
The point is.
you really helped me focus.

755
00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:27.300
You know. this-- this park.

756
00:28:27.433 --> 00:28:29.266
it's. it's important.

757
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.033
it's important to the community

758
00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:32.934
and you.

759
00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:34.600
And it's important to me.

760
00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:37.967
It's something
that I needed to do.

761
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.533
To give back.

762
00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:41.867
Thank you.
That really means a lot.

763
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.934
Okay. Funding.

764
00:28:46.066 --> 00:28:49.033
This is good.
but it won't get us to our goal.

765
00:28:49.166 --> 00:28:51.500
Let me think on this.

766
00:28:51.633 --> 00:28:52.767
Ooh!

767
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.100
The firefighters
have their annual calendar.

768
00:28:57.233 --> 00:28:58.500
Shoot. Maybe I could
talk to the Chief.

769
00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:01.834
see if we can build
a lot more publicity this year.

770
00:29:01.967 --> 00:29:04.066
we could bring in
a lot more money.

771
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.066
That would be killer.

772
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.433
Oh! Speaking of which.

773
00:29:06.567 --> 00:29:08.600
I totally thought that was gonna
happen in the movie. didn't you?

774
00:29:08.734 --> 00:29:11.433
But. like. at the beginning
of the movie. not at the end.

775
00:29:11.567 --> 00:29:14.133
Whoa! That was really hard.

776
00:29:14.266 --> 00:29:15.533
Such a good movie. Important.

777
00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:18.567
Really hard to watch at the end.
but needed.

778
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.133
Keep going.

779
00:29:20.266 --> 00:29:22.000
Oh! Trending on TikTok! Ah!

780
00:29:22.133 --> 00:29:27.400

Boxing.

making people feel good
in the community.

You an expert at everything?

800
00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:23.800
Uh. well. you see.

801
00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:25.867

"if you can't handle the heat--"

Yeah. it's time

805
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.133
for your session
with Miss Kimble. honey.

806
00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.533
Let's do one more
and then we'll go. okay?

807
00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:39.300
You ready? Let's go.

808
00:30:39.433 --> 00:30:40.166
Whoa.

809
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.400
Whoo.

810
00:30:42.533 --> 00:30:44.000
Good job!

811
00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:46.867
Whoosh. pew! Pew!

812
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.867
Bye. Gia.

813
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.166
Bye. sweetheart.

814
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.233
Yeah. it's an online Zoom thing.

815
00:30:51.367 --> 00:30:52.533
Oh. nice.
What kind of class?

816
00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:55.066
Oh. it's not a class.
It's therapy.

817
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.033
Oh.

818
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:57.266
Nothing serious. you know.

819
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.400
It seems like having

820
00:30:58.533 --> 00:31:00.633
a dad who's a firefighter
has created some anxiety.

821
00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:02.567
You know.
nightmares. here and there.

822
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.100
That's tough.

823
00:31:04.233 --> 00:31:06.266
You know. T.J. Haislet.
who worked with us.

824
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.033
he was a close family friend.

825
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:11.867
and losing him was...

826
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.400
hard on everyone. right?

827
00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:16.166
Especially Lizzy--
she's been quiet about it.

828
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.233
so I think she's having
a difficult time--

829
00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:19.467
scared she might
lose her dad.

830
00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:24.266
Yeah. well. you have
a very dangerous job.

831
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.467
Yeah.

832
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.533
And I guess there's no way
to be a firefighter

833
00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:30.100
without going to the fires.

834
00:31:30.233 --> 00:31:32.066
Unless you're the Chief.
He usually stays behind.

835
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.934
Right.

836
00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:34.000
but I'm guessing it takes

837
00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:35.533
a long time to climb
that ladder. so to speak.

838
00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:36.867
Funny you mention that.

839
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.400
I actually just got offered
a position yesterday.

840
00:31:39.533 --> 00:31:41.333
- What? No way.
- Yeah. Chief Reed's retiring.

841
00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:43.300
That's incredible.
When do you start?

842
00:31:43.433 --> 00:31:46.100
Oh. no. no. I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna take it. No.

843
00:31:46.233 --> 00:31:48.133
I feel like I should--
owe the crew to stick around.

844
00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:49.133
We're kind of a tight-knit unit.

845
00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:50.533
Oh.

846
00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:52.533
Yeah.

847
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.500
Oh! You--

848
00:31:54.633 --> 00:31:56.100
- You wanna--?
- Mm-hmm!

849
00:31:56.233 --> 00:31:58.300
Okay. you mean business.
The jacket came off!

850
00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:00.133
Of course I mean business.

851
00:32:00.266 --> 00:32:02.100
Oh. let's see how hard
you hit here. sister.

852
00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:03.100
Okay. all right.

853
00:32:03.233 --> 00:32:04.300
- Ready?
- Yeah.

854
00:32:04.433 --> 00:32:05.467
Yeah? Yeah?

855
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.467
Oh! Oh. and by the way.
thanks for the cookbook.

856
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.400
- I read it twice already.
- You did. did you?

857
00:32:10.533 --> 00:32:12.166
Okay. so you learned
a few tricks

858
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.200
you didn't know you didn't know?

859
00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:14.400
Well. not necessarily.

860
00:32:14.533 --> 00:32:17.333
but I did get some inspiration
for my own cookbook.

861
00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:20.033
Mm. which we have established
will not include vegetables.

862
00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:21.266
Hey. that reminds me.

863
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.967
We need to talk
about our barbecue bet.

864
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.166
I saw the three
at the end of that combo.

865
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.467
Ahem. The barbecue bet.

866
00:32:28.533 --> 00:32:30.066
I mean.
unless you're backing out.

867
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.633
- Backing out from a challenge?
- Yeah.

868
00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:32.934
Not a chance.

869
00:32:33.066 --> 00:32:35.000
Okay. Okay. okay.
Well. we need some ground rules.

870
00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:36.000
Okay.

871
00:32:36.133 --> 00:32:37.367
Homemade barbecue sauce.

872
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.600
But aren't you the jar lady?

873
00:32:38.734 --> 00:32:40.467
I know. but I'm gonna learn
how to make my own.

874
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.033
You know. new horizons.

875
00:32:42.166 --> 00:32:43.166
I like that. Agreed.

876
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.367
Okay. but same meat--
apples to apples.

877
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.533
No vegetables?

878
00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:48.500
- Maybe a few.
- All right.

879
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.233
So when are we starting this?

880
00:32:50.367 --> 00:32:51.400
A few weeks?

881
00:32:51.533 --> 00:32:53.300
Gives me some time to get
the new grill all fixed up.

882
00:32:53.433 --> 00:32:55.266
You mean my old grill.

883
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.166
Hey. Old Betty is mine now.

884
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.000
Ha. Good luck with that.

885
00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:00.700
Oh!

886
00:33:00.834 --> 00:33:03.000
You know. I'm actually
not bad at fixing things.

887
00:33:03.133 --> 00:33:05.166
I noticed
your porch light flickers.

888
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.033
But it's not the bulb.
it's an electrical problem.

889
00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:09.767
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Let me know

890
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.300
if you want me
to take a look at it.

891
00:33:11.433 --> 00:33:13.333
You know where to find me.

892
00:33:40.467 --> 00:33:41.667
Hi. Gia.

893
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.400
Hi! You gonna help me?

894
00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:47.166
Working.

895
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.367
She's a beaut!

896
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.367
Okay.

897
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.800
Uh-huh. You scared yet?

898
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.166
Okay. now you can go
the other way.

899
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.433
Good job!

900
00:34:43.467 --> 00:34:45.233
So who are
your friends at school?

901
00:34:45.367 --> 00:34:47.500
- Alexander.
- Alexander? Who's Alexander?

902
00:34:47.633 --> 00:34:50.100
He's about
to get married to me.

903
00:34:50.233 --> 00:34:51.100
You're going to marry?

904
00:34:51.233 --> 00:34:52.567
You know who
you're going to marry?

905
00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:55.800
Who's Alexander?

906
00:34:55.934 --> 00:34:57.667
He's a friend at my school.

907
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.367
He's-- He's five.

908
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.467
Did you know this?

909
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.500
No. I didn't--
I need to meet this guy.

910
00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:02.667
Rewind.

911
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.133
Back that up.

912
00:35:04.266 --> 00:35:05.767
So you're gonna tell me.

913
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.500
I went over to him and I said
"Hi. What's your name?"

914
00:35:09.633 --> 00:35:12.233
And then he said "Alexander."
and then I said...

915
00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:14.133
It's too tight.

916
00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:15.900
I'm sorry.

917
00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:18.133
There's too many bumps.

918
00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:19.633
Almost got it.

919
00:35:19.767 --> 00:35:21.500
Maybe Gia could help?

920
00:35:21.633 --> 00:35:25.333
Uh. now what makes you think
she can do a better job than me?

921
00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:27.700
She can box better than you

922
00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:29.767
and she can grill
better than you.

923
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.834
Oh. she can now. can she? Huh.

924
00:35:31.967 --> 00:35:34.600
I bet she's a good mom.

925
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:38.166
Except she has no kids.

926
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.867
Then I bet
she'll be a good mom.

927
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.633
I bet you wish
you had a mom. don't you?

928
00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:49.567
All my friends do.

929
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.800
I know.

930
00:35:50.934 --> 00:35:53.333
You're the best dad
in the world.

931
00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:55.834
Just. sometimes.
I just wish for that.

932
00:35:57.533 --> 00:36:00.066
Oh. Come here.

933
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:03.533
Let me look at you.
Hold on.

934
00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:05.433
I think I've mastered the bun.

935
00:36:05.567 --> 00:36:06.900
I guess it works.

936
00:36:07.033 --> 00:36:10.834
But next you have to watch
that YouTube video for braids.

937
00:36:10.967 --> 00:36:12.500
Don't forget.
You promised.

938
00:36:12.633 --> 00:36:13.934
All right.

939
00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:17.533
Pshht.

940
00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:19.066
All right. let's get you going.

941
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.433
Braids. huh? Okay.

942
00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:44.567
How'd it go. boys?

943
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.800
What am I. chopped liver?

944
00:36:45.934 --> 00:36:46.967
"People."

945
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.700
- How'd it go. people?
- Better.

946
00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:49.867
Thank you.

947
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.467
They had some old
Christmas lights kept up.

948
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.533
Yeah. luckily. we got there

949
00:36:52.667 --> 00:36:54.233
in the nick of time
and no lives were lost.

950
00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:56.734
House is wet.
but it's saved.

951
00:36:56.867 --> 00:36:57.834
Well. good job. fellas.

952
00:36:57.967 --> 00:36:59.333
Seriously?

953
00:37:00.767 --> 00:37:01.734
"Folks."

954
00:37:01.867 --> 00:37:03.700
Good job. folks.

955
00:37:03.834 --> 00:37:05.867
- Jim. you got a minute?
- Yeah.

956
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.800
So. you put any more thought
into filling my boots?

957
00:37:09.934 --> 00:37:12.033
Uh. those are some big boots
to fill. Chief.

958
00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:14.633
Yeah. well. 30 years
and they're tired.

959
00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:15.834
And I want to play
with my grandchildren

960
00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.367
while I still got the energy.

961
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.667
As you know.
my retirement party

962
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.667
is the same day
as the Labor BBQ.

963
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.000
I gotta know before then.

964
00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:25.734
I know.
I'm still thinking about it.

965
00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:26.800
I can see that.

966
00:37:26.934 --> 00:37:29.033
You're hesitant
and I don't know why.

967
00:37:29.166 --> 00:37:30.867
You're a born leader.

968
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.967
Thanks. Chief.

969
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.834
Hey.

970
00:37:42.967 --> 00:37:44.667
- Hey.
- What was that about?

971
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.000
Ah. nothing.

972
00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:47.600
Right.

973
00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:49.667
So. how's it going
with the new neighbor?

974
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.600
Good. She's being really keen

975
00:37:52.734 --> 00:37:54.333
about this
competitive grilling thing.

976
00:37:54.467 --> 00:37:56.333
A lady who likes a challenge
and barbecue--

977
00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:57.767
sounds like a lady
for Jim Dunlap.

978
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.834
Ah. don't start that.

979
00:37:58.967 --> 00:38:00.834
Let me ask you something--

980
00:38:00.967 --> 00:38:03.066
when is that last time
you went on a date?

981
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.467
A date?

982
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.533
Yeah. You know.

983
00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:08.400
sitting with a pretty lady.
passing the time.

984
00:38:08.533 --> 00:38:10.767
Every morning. evening.
and a little time in between.

985
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.000
Her name is Lizzy.

986
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600
You know what your problem is?

987
00:38:14.734 --> 00:38:15.800
I have a lot.

988
00:38:15.934 --> 00:38:17.667
and I'm pretty sure
you're gonna tell me some more.

989
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.934
You think
you have to do this alone.

990
00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:22.367
This?

991
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.834
Parenting. Life.

992
00:38:23.967 --> 00:38:25.433
But you don't.

993
00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:27.500
I know. that's why
I got you and Karen.

994
00:38:27.633 --> 00:38:30.533
You know we're always here
for you. we're family.

995
00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:31.934
but I'm just saying

996
00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:33.533
maybe it's time

997
00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:35.433
to let your walls down

998
00:38:35.567 --> 00:38:37.900
and let someone in.

999
00:38:38.033 --> 00:38:40.400
For your and Lizzy's sake.

1000
00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:41.800
And you think

1001
00:38:41.934 --> 00:38:43.533
it's that competitive blond girl
next door?

1002
00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:45.600
What do you got against
blond girls?

1003
00:38:45.734 --> 00:38:46.834
Nothing.
I know they have fun.

1004
00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:48.667
but I just never dated one.
is all I'm saying.

1005
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.600
Even more reason
to try new things.

1006
00:38:50.734 --> 00:38:52.867
Anyways. I gotta get going.

1007
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.400
I got to get my stuff ready
for my class tomorrow.

1008
00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.367
Class?

1009
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.734
Yeah. barbecue saucing.

1010
00:38:57.867 --> 00:38:59.533
the fundraiser for the park.

1011
00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:01.734
Ah. wish I could make it.

1012
00:39:01.867 --> 00:39:03.133
but I'm actually
on shift tomorrow.

1013
00:39:03.266 --> 00:39:04.467
Oh. yeah. that's right.

1014
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.433
Is Gia gonna be there?

1015
00:39:06.567 --> 00:39:08.800
No. Why would Gia be coming?

1016
00:39:08.934 --> 00:39:10.800
Because...

1017
00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:12.500
♪ This love

1018
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:15.166
♪ Is on fi-i-i-ire

1019
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.734
♪ This love is on fire...

1020
00:39:18.867 --> 00:39:19.967
You need
some singing lessons.

1021
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:20.967
- Is that smoke?
- Stop.

1022
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.967
Somebody call
the fire department--

1023
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.066
La. la--

1024
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.000
Because this love is so hot!

1025
00:39:25.133 --> 00:39:26.033
Ooh!

1026
00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:28.900
Ooh! Ah!
Gotta put that fire out!

1027
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.400
- Leave me alone. bruh.
- Sizzle. sizzle!

1028
00:39:30.533 --> 00:39:31.834
I'm gonna getcha!

1029
00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:41.166
You sound good.

1030
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.433
I am.

1031
00:39:42.567 --> 00:39:44.533
And out of breath.
What are you doing?

1032
00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:46.166
Speedwalking
in the neighborhood.

1033
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.633
Trying to get in shape
for a marathon fundraiser

1034
00:39:47.767 --> 00:39:49.066
- I'm putting on.
- For work?

1035
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.133
Yeah.

1036
00:39:50.266 --> 00:39:51.333
So how's the neighborhood?

1037
00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:54.166
It's lovely. actually.

1038
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.767
I didn't think I'd fall
into this place so easily.

1039
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.166
Fall into this place?

1040
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.700
Sounds like you've made
a few friends. then?

1041
00:40:00.834 --> 00:40:02.000
I have.

1042
00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:06.166
Mom? What are you doing?

1043
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.433
Oh. I'm sorry. honey.

1044
00:40:08.567 --> 00:40:10.567
I'm just trying to get
this living room clean

1045
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.166
and get your father
off his butt.

1046
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.200
So... my neighbor's

1047
00:40:14.333 --> 00:40:15.200
really nice.

1048
00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:16.200
A father.

1049
00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:17.700
Really. really sweet
little girl.

1050
00:40:17.834 --> 00:40:18.834
Single parent?

1051
00:40:20.233 --> 00:40:21.300
Is he divorced?

1052
00:40:21.433 --> 00:40:23.533
I'm assuming.
I haven't asked.

1053
00:40:23.667 --> 00:40:25.333
Is he handsome?

1054
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:28.000
Yeah.
Yeah. he is. actually.

1055
00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:31.233
Hey-- Hey. Mom. can I--
can I call you back?

1056
00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:33.166
Yeah. sure. honey.
Have fun.

1057
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.633
Handsome neighbor.
she said.

1058
00:40:41.233 --> 00:40:42.467
Hello!

1059
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.467
My name is Jim Dunlap.

1060
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.667
and I'm a firefighter here

1061
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.734
at Maple Plains Fire Department.
as many of you may know.

1062
00:40:47.867 --> 00:40:50.233
but my real job is teaching
this barbecue class.

1063
00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:54.467
And this here is my daughter
and sous chef. Lizzy.

1064
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.467
I'm six years old!

1065
00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.867
She's six years old.

1066
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.433
Now. making your own BBQ sauce
is a lot easier than you think.

1067
00:41:02.567 --> 00:41:04.700
but it bears the skills
that reward

1068
00:41:04.834 --> 00:41:07.533
with fortitude. patience.
and lots of ribs!

1069
00:41:07.667 --> 00:41:08.433
Gia!

1070
00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:09.800
Hey. you.

1071
00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:12.166
Well. well. well.
look who it is.

1072
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.667
Jim Dunlap's barbecue class?
Now. how could I pass that up?

1073
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.333
See. I have
this little competition

1074
00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:18.734
coming up--
I could use a few pointers.

1075
00:41:18.867 --> 00:41:19.800
Right.

1076
00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:21.600
Well. luckily for you.
we have an open spot.

1077
00:41:21.734 --> 00:41:23.467
- Have a seat.
- Excellent.

1078
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.200
So everyone has
all their ingredients

1079
00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:27.667
that they love
and hold dear?

1080
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.367
Well. let's get this show
started. shall we?

1081
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.600
Hey. Lizzy!

1082
00:41:32.734 --> 00:41:34.600
Can you show me
where the ingredients are?

1083
00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:36.800
Sure! Come over this way.

1084
00:41:36.934 --> 00:41:38.433
This way? Okay.

1085
00:41:38.567 --> 00:41:41.166
Oh! All right.
What should I start with?

1086
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.633
Probably the vinegar.

1087
00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.200
The vinegar has the most...

1088
00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:49.233
That's an excellent idea!
Vinegar. Okay.

1089
00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:51.200
And if you want
to beat my dad...

1090
00:41:52.467 --> 00:41:54.533
So next. I like to add
a little molasses.

1091
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:58.133
That's more Kansas City style.

1092
00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:00.767
gives it a little tanginess.

1093
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.500
Then I like to add
a little garlic...

1094
00:42:05.333 --> 00:42:06.734
...some black pepper...

1095
00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:10.800
...and some salt.

1096
00:42:10.934 --> 00:42:12.433
Don't forget
the onion powder!

1097
00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:13.867
Right.

1098
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.567
Onion powder.

1099
00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:17.900
Thank you. sous chef.

1100
00:42:19.734 --> 00:42:21.600
And mix that up.

1101
00:42:21.734 --> 00:42:25.233
So I'm gonna walk around
and check everybody's sauces.

1102
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.467
Good job.

1103
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.166
What about
a little paprika. chef?

1104
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.367
I'm not really a big fan.

1105
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.633
All right. well.

1106
00:42:33.767 --> 00:42:35.533
dare I suggest lime?

1107
00:42:35.667 --> 00:42:38.734
See. I prefer the lime as a rub
so that it burns into the smoke.

1108
00:42:38.867 --> 00:42:40.633
Yeah. but if you sear
the sauce on the meat.

1109
00:42:40.767 --> 00:42:41.633
it becomes tacky.

1110
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.433
and won't that
diffuse the lime.

1111
00:42:43.567 --> 00:42:44.667
rather than having it
smoked into it?

1112
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.333
Well. it's a matter of taste.

1113
00:42:46.467 --> 00:42:47.467
All right.

1114
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.600
Well...

1115
00:42:48.734 --> 00:42:50.767
you are gonna taste mine.

1116
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.500
Yours? No way.

1117
00:42:52.633 --> 00:42:53.934
Yeah.

1118
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.967
Come on. Dad.

1119
00:43:00.867 --> 00:43:02.266
It's good. right?

1120
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.667
I mean. it's all right.

1121
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.533
Okay. Lizzy. you try it.

1122
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.700
Yum!

1123
00:43:12.834 --> 00:43:13.734
Hey. teammate!

1124
00:43:13.867 --> 00:43:15.300
You're not supposed
to say "Yum!"

1125
00:43:15.433 --> 00:43:17.667
You know I'm gearing up to have
a barbecue-off with her. right?

1126
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.400
She's gonna beat you. Dad.

1127
00:43:23.333 --> 00:43:25.433
- Do you have to go?
- No. no.

1128
00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:26.367
I'm not on shift right now.

1129
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.600
Jim!

1130
00:43:27.734 --> 00:43:28.867
We got a structure fire.

1131
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.467
We're gonna need you
on this one.

1132
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.300
Oh. uh. do you mind
watching Lizzy for me?

1133
00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:33.600
Yeah. of course.

1134
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.667
I'll see you
when I get home. okay? Mwah.

1135
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.066
- Be safe. Daddy!
- I will!

1136
00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.400
It's okay. sweetie.

1137
00:43:52.834 --> 00:43:54.500
Let's go. guys.

1138
00:43:59.967 --> 00:44:01.834
Let's go. let's go.

1139
00:44:21.734 --> 00:44:24.433
Wow. That was good.

1140
00:44:24.567 --> 00:44:25.967
Pasta. Parm. butter.
and veggies.

1141
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.600
It's one my mom used to serve me
when I was your age.

1142
00:44:28.734 --> 00:44:29.967
It was my favorite!

1143
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.567
It's my favorite now. too.

1144
00:44:33.066 --> 00:44:34.500
What's your Mom's name?

1145
00:44:34.633 --> 00:44:35.500
Jean Margaret.

1146
00:44:35.633 --> 00:44:37.467
But we call her Jean.
for short.

1147
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.567
Is she nice. like you?

1148
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.500
She is.

1149
00:44:39.633 --> 00:44:41.767
And your mom?

1150
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.300
She's not here anymore.

1151
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:47.000
Oh.

1152
00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:48.834
Hey.

1153
00:44:48.967 --> 00:44:50.433
Look at the time.

1154
00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:51.700
We better get you ready for bed.

1155
00:44:51.834 --> 00:44:54.500
Did you hear from my dad yet?

1156
00:44:54.633 --> 00:44:56.533
No. sweetie. not yet.

1157
00:44:57.767 --> 00:44:58.967
Hey. but listen.

1158
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.934
I know your daddy
has a dangerous job.

1159
00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:05.567
but he is a very skilled man.

1160
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.800
Very well-trained.

1161
00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:09.100
and he's with your Uncle Mo.
who's the same.

1162
00:45:09.233 --> 00:45:11.667
And your dad is very brave--

1163
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.834
just like you are.

1164
00:45:12.967 --> 00:45:15.100
when you're waiting for him
when he's out on a job.

1165
00:45:15.233 --> 00:45:18.467
And I can't imagine
what you're thinking. but...

1166
00:45:19.533 --> 00:45:21.867
You don't have anything
to worry about. okay?

1167
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.967
I promise.

1168
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.934
That's what my Aunt Karen
always says. too.

1169
00:45:26.066 --> 00:45:27.066
Good.

1170
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.567
Let's get you upstairs.

1171
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.100
And how about
I give you a piggyback?

1172
00:45:31.533 --> 00:45:32.834
'Kay.

1173
00:45:34.767 --> 00:45:36.734
All aboard!

1174
00:45:38.533 --> 00:45:40.033
Whew! Here we go.

1175
00:46:01.533 --> 00:46:03.100
Hey.

1176
00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:06.467
Hi.

1177
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.967
I'm so sorry.
I must've dozed off.

1178
00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.600
What time is it?

1179
00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:13.633
Early. I think about 6:30.

1180
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.600
Looks like she's still asleep.

1181
00:46:16.734 --> 00:46:19.900
Yeah. normally doesn't wake up
until around 7:00 or so.

1182
00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:22.500
Oh. Here.

1183
00:46:24.567 --> 00:46:26.000
Always double up

1184
00:46:26.133 --> 00:46:28.033
on the water.

1185
00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:29.800
Thank you.

1186
00:46:29.934 --> 00:46:31.000
Drink?

1187
00:46:31.133 --> 00:46:32.667
Oh. Private stash. huh?

1188
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.934
Of course.

1189
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.967
Cheers!

1190
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.533
Cheers.

1191
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.967
So...

1192
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.433
how was she?

1193
00:46:49.567 --> 00:46:51.734
She was an angel.

1194
00:46:51.867 --> 00:46:54.166
Honestly. Jim. she was
an absolute pleasure to watch.

1195
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.033
Well. thank you.
I really appreciate it.

1196
00:46:56.166 --> 00:46:58.066
Normally. Mo and Karen take her.

1197
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.967
but this just made things
a little. well. less chaotic.

1198
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.767
Yeah. I bet.

1199
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.500
How... How was it?

1200
00:47:05.633 --> 00:47:06.800
The call?

1201
00:47:06.934 --> 00:47:09.967
Oh. it was big one.
It was an apartment building.

1202
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.867
Everyone okay. though?

1203
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.934
Unfortunately. no.

1204
00:47:13.967 --> 00:47:15.834
There was a man
on one of the top floors.

1205
00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:17.000
who was sedated.

1206
00:47:17.133 --> 00:47:19.066
but it's unclear
if it was because of the smoke

1207
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.900
or medication.

1208
00:47:21.033 --> 00:47:23.200
Um. he d--
he didn't wake up.

1209
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.934
And Mo. he--
he tried his hardest.

1210
00:47:28.266 --> 00:47:30.166
But it wasn't possible.
in the end.

1211
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.033
I'm so sorry.

1212
00:47:33.166 --> 00:47:34.700
How's Mo?

1213
00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:36.533
Broken leg. maybe?

1214
00:47:36.667 --> 00:47:38.100
He's still at the hospital.

1215
00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:39.533
He broke his leg?

1216
00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:42.066
One of the floorboards
gave way.

1217
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.700
but he's safe.
and that's all that matters.

1218
00:47:44.834 --> 00:47:46.900
Yeah.

1219
00:47:50.633 --> 00:47:52.100
Never noticed those before.

1220
00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:54.734
Those rings?

1221
00:47:54.867 --> 00:47:56.533
Your parents?

1222
00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:57.633
Um...

1223
00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:01.867
No. they're... they're mine.

1224
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.233
And my husband's.

1225
00:48:07.033 --> 00:48:09.133
The reason I moved out here...

1226
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.200
...and bought a house
and I started over. is...

1227
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.033
...my husband.
he passed.

1228
00:48:18.166 --> 00:48:19.567
Ohh.

1229
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.533
I'm so sorry. Gia.

1230
00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:22.900
Yeah. it was cancer.

1231
00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:26.333
We had only been married
a few months.

1232
00:48:27.667 --> 00:48:31.200
We were just starting
to look at houses

1233
00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:32.834
when he got the news.

1234
00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:35.900
And four months later.
he was gone.

1235
00:48:37.133 --> 00:48:38.100
Anyway...

1236
00:48:38.233 --> 00:48:41.567
after over a year of living
in that apartment.

1237
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.133
I just...

1238
00:48:43.266 --> 00:48:45.934
I just couldn't
do it anymore.

1239
00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:48.934
His friends and his--
his family...

1240
00:48:50.066 --> 00:48:52.734
I realized

1241
00:48:52.867 --> 00:48:55.567
that I couldn't move on because...

1242
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.800
they couldn't move on.

1243
00:48:57.934 --> 00:49:00.166
and they couldn't move on

1244
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.834
because they didn't think
that I could move on.

1245
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.867
Man.

1246
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.700
Grief is cruel. man.

1247
00:49:07.834 --> 00:49:10.633
It fools you into thinking
you have the upper hand.

1248
00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:11.900
You know.
you get these moments

1249
00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:14.233
where you feel normal.
you can breathe.

1250
00:49:14.367 --> 00:49:15.734
and then. out of nowhere.

1251
00:49:15.867 --> 00:49:18.133
it just snatches the breath
right out of you again.

1252
00:49:23.133 --> 00:49:24.633
Lizzy's mom...

1253
00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:27.734
she-- she died
while giving birth to her.

1254
00:49:27.867 --> 00:49:30.433
Oh. my gosh.
I'm so sorry.

1255
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.033
I had no idea.

1256
00:49:34.166 --> 00:49:37.200
I just-- I just thought
you were divorced.

1257
00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:39.967
Well. wouldn't that
have been easier. right?

1258
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.934
Um...

1259
00:49:42.066 --> 00:49:42.934
it was a blood disorder.

1260
00:49:43.066 --> 00:49:44.300
Nothing we knew about.

1261
00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:45.600
The doctor said

1262
00:49:45.734 --> 00:49:48.233
there was nothing more
that he could've done. so.

1263
00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:50.233
That's so terrible.

1264
00:49:50.367 --> 00:49:54.233
But. just like you.
I wanted a fresh start.

1265
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.000
So. me and Lizzy.
we're originally from New York.

1266
00:49:58.133 --> 00:49:59.734
that's where she was born.

1267
00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:01.867
And I met Mo at
a firefighter training course

1268
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.166
we took back East.

1269
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.300
It was actually him
who convinced me to come here.

1270
00:50:07.467 --> 00:50:09.433
So. I picked up and moved.

1271
00:50:10.967 --> 00:50:13.200
That's very brave of you.

1272
00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:16.667
Must be so hard...

1273
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.367
being a single parent.

1274
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.200
It is.

1275
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:22.233
It's a lot of responsibility.

1276
00:50:22.367 --> 00:50:23.934
And you know. most parents

1277
00:50:24.066 --> 00:50:26.000
want to give their child
what they're lacking.

1278
00:50:26.133 --> 00:50:29.700
and... and in my case...

1279
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.667
...it's a mom--

1280
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.100
a woman in her life
that's all hers.

1281
00:50:37.233 --> 00:50:39.700
Maybe one day.

1282
00:50:39.834 --> 00:50:42.400
Who's to say you won't
find the perfect match?

1283
00:50:43.467 --> 00:50:45.133
"Who's to say I won't."
is right.

1284
00:50:47.734 --> 00:50:49.767
And tonight it really hit home--

1285
00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.100
it put into perspective
that I'm all she's got.

1286
00:50:52.233 --> 00:50:53.767
You know?

1287
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.200
It has been so nice

1288
00:50:56.333 --> 00:50:58.633
getting to know
you and Lizzy. Jim.

1289
00:50:58.767 --> 00:51:02.133
You are an exceptional dad.

1290
00:51:03.166 --> 00:51:05.367
You're a brave firefighter

1291
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.200
and you've been
a really great friend.

1292
00:51:07.333 --> 00:51:10.266
You've made me feel...

1293
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.500
...happy.

1294
00:51:14.834 --> 00:51:17.800
Which I didn't think was
gonna be possible again.

1295
00:51:18.934 --> 00:51:20.333
Same.

1296
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.934
You're quiet.

1297
00:51:44.066 --> 00:51:45.934
Yeah? Hadn't noticed.

1298
00:51:46.066 --> 00:51:48.800
Come on. man.
What's going on?

1299
00:51:48.934 --> 00:51:50.600
Know you well enough to see
you're thinking on something.

1300
00:51:52.934 --> 00:51:54.200
All right. well.

1301
00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:55.500
just thinking about you. actually.

1302
00:51:55.633 --> 00:51:58.500
Thanks. man.
You know I love you. but...

1303
00:51:58.633 --> 00:52:00.333
No. not like that. That's...

1304
00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:03.200
It's the other night.
when you busted your leg.

1305
00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:07.100
That. uh. brought back memories
about T.J..

1306
00:52:07.233 --> 00:52:08.300
when we lost him.

1307
00:52:08.433 --> 00:52:09.867
Yeah.

1308
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.900
Just showed me how close
we live on the edge. you know?

1309
00:52:12.033 --> 00:52:13.000
Well.

1310
00:52:13.133 --> 00:52:17.266
just a busted-up leg here.
so we are all good.

1311
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.100
Yeah. but it could've been
worse than that. man.

1312
00:52:20.233 --> 00:52:23.300
Always can be...

1313
00:52:23.433 --> 00:52:24.467
but...

1314
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.834
it's just part of life.
being a firefighter. right?

1315
00:52:26.967 --> 00:52:28.533
Yeah.

1316
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.300
Chief offered me the job.

1317
00:52:33.433 --> 00:52:35.000
To be the new Chief?

1318
00:52:35.133 --> 00:52:37.533
Yes! That's amazing.

1319
00:52:37.667 --> 00:52:38.934
And not surprising.

1320
00:52:39.066 --> 00:52:40.100
I always knew.
when the time came.

1321
00:52:40.233 --> 00:52:41.500
you would be the choice.

1322
00:52:43.033 --> 00:52:44.567
So why the contemplative look?

1323
00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.667
You know you're supposed
to be happy. right?

1324
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:50.500
Because
we're first-responders. man.

1325
00:52:50.633 --> 00:52:53.800
We respond
to the most dangerous things

1326
00:52:53.934 --> 00:52:55.467
imaginable.

1327
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.834
and you've always had my back

1328
00:52:57.967 --> 00:53:01.300
as much as I've always
had your back--

1329
00:53:01.433 --> 00:53:03.300
especially when things
went south.

1330
00:53:04.467 --> 00:53:06.100
I just wouldn't feel comfortable

1331
00:53:06.233 --> 00:53:09.000
sending you out there
without me.

1332
00:53:09.133 --> 00:53:10.500
I'm not taking the job.

1333
00:53:10.633 --> 00:53:13.867
You're not taking the job?

1334
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.633
Jim.

1335
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.233
I know you're scared.

1336
00:53:18.367 --> 00:53:20.333
I get that.

1337
00:53:20.467 --> 00:53:22.000
We are all scared.

1338
00:53:22.133 --> 00:53:23.600
All of us--

1339
00:53:23.734 --> 00:53:26.467
everyone in this world.

1340
00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.633
It's life.

1341
00:53:29.767 --> 00:53:32.600
But let me ask you something.

1342
00:53:32.734 --> 00:53:35.066
What would be the best part
of being Chief?

1343
00:53:36.166 --> 00:53:38.467
Best part would probably
be the worst part. I guess?

1344
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.033
Being Chief would take you

1345
00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:42.567
out of the front-line aspect
of the job. sure.

1346
00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.100
but it would also put you
where I know you need to be--

1347
00:53:47.233 --> 00:53:49.300
in a leadership role.

1348
00:53:49.433 --> 00:53:52.233
and in a spot where you.
as a lone father.

1349
00:53:52.367 --> 00:53:54.333
are safer.

1350
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:58.467
You'll never let me down. Jim.

1351
00:53:59.734 --> 00:54:01.633
You're my best friend.

1352
00:54:01.767 --> 00:54:03.367
It would be my honor...

1353
00:54:04.467 --> 00:54:06.066
...to have you as my boss.

1354
00:54:07.633 --> 00:54:09.033
Come here.

1355
00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:15.934
Ah. geez.

1356
00:54:16.066 --> 00:54:17.233
My bad.

1357
00:54:17.367 --> 00:54:18.500
I think I got your shirt wet.

1358
00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:20.066
Well. as long as
you didn't wet your pants.

1359
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.033
we are all good.

1360
00:54:27.433 --> 00:54:29.133
So?

1361
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:30.467
Are you coming?

1362
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.133
Uh...

1363
00:54:32.266 --> 00:54:33.300
When is this. again?

1364
00:54:33.433 --> 00:54:34.667
- Saturday.
- Saturday. huh?

1365
00:54:35.734 --> 00:54:38.300
So why are there kids
in wheelchairs?

1366
00:54:38.433 --> 00:54:40.734
Because we're raising money
for an inclusion playground.

1367
00:54:42.166 --> 00:54:43.000
Children with disabilities.

1368
00:54:43.133 --> 00:54:44.500
Oh.

1369
00:54:44.633 --> 00:54:45.967
Oh! Right!

1370
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.266
Sorry. Senior moment.

1371
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.567
Uh. yeah. um...

1372
00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.934
No. I-I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

1373
00:54:52.066 --> 00:54:54.567
Um. having lunch with
the Cherwin Cable suppliers.

1374
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.967
Cherwin?

1375
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.533
I only know of the developers.
Is it the same family?

1376
00:54:58.667 --> 00:54:59.600
Yeah. it is.

1377
00:54:59.734 --> 00:55:02.000
Ah. Curious why
you'd be meeting with them?

1378
00:55:02.133 --> 00:55:03.600
I mean. what does
Parks and Rec have to do

1379
00:55:03.734 --> 00:55:06.266
with cable suppliers-
slash-condo developers?

1380
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.367
Oh. well...
aren't we the nosy Nelly?

1381
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.166
Oh. sorry.
yeah. none of my business.

1382
00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.233
I was just--just curious.

1383
00:55:13.367 --> 00:55:15.400
Actually. I've been meaning
to talk to you about it.

1384
00:55:15.533 --> 00:55:18.467
As you probably well know.
I'm running for Mayor. yeah?

1385
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.767
Y-Yes. Yes. yes. I know.

1386
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.367
Well. I was hoping
for your support.

1387
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.467
Yes. of course. yeah.
you have it.

1388
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.734
Well. that's great.

1389
00:55:26.867 --> 00:55:28.700
Happy to put up some flyers.
hand them out at the race--

1390
00:55:28.834 --> 00:55:32.200
no problem. but you know
what might be really helpful?

1391
00:55:32.333 --> 00:55:33.734
Is if you actually came.

1392
00:55:33.867 --> 00:55:35.500
Showed your face.
showed the community

1393
00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:37.433
you're behind
building such a playground.

1394
00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.400
Yeah. well.

1395
00:55:39.533 --> 00:55:40.633
Even some of the firefighters
will be there.

1396
00:55:40.767 --> 00:55:42.367
since I'm helping to get

1397
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.333
their very much-needed gym greenlit.

1398
00:55:44.467 --> 00:55:46.400
Firefighters. Huh.

1399
00:55:47.467 --> 00:55:50.166
Well. look. I know you're trying
to help 'em and everything--

1400
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.000
Did you know that they lost
a firefighter earlier this year?

1401
00:55:53.133 --> 00:55:55.300
And just the other day.
one of them risked his life

1402
00:55:55.433 --> 00:55:57.266
at the apartment building fire
on North Street?

1403
00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.433
They're front-line workers. Don.

1404
00:56:00.567 --> 00:56:03.100
they-they really need
a place to work out in.

1405
00:56:03.233 --> 00:56:05.100
Yeah. and Chief Reed
knows what he needs to do

1406
00:56:05.233 --> 00:56:06.800
to get that green light.

1407
00:56:06.934 --> 00:56:08.834
So. this is about
your political agenda.

1408
00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:11.300
and not about city ethics?

1409
00:56:11.433 --> 00:56:12.300
No! No. no.

1410
00:56:12.433 --> 00:56:14.433
This is about
you doing your job.

1411
00:56:14.567 --> 00:56:17.200
Now. how about you go out
and get that funding.

1412
00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:18.700
and I'll get you
the land for it?

1413
00:56:18.834 --> 00:56:21.133
Wait. you found a spot?

1414
00:56:21.266 --> 00:56:22.166
Well. you've been
yapping so much.

1415
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.500
I haven't had a chance
to tell you. have I?

1416
00:56:23.633 --> 00:56:25.300
No. Your prospectus was great.

1417
00:56:25.433 --> 00:56:26.567
They-- They approved.

1418
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.266
So now it just comes down
to the money

1419
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.333
and my final A-okay
for the land.

1420
00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:32.567
That is-- That is great.

1421
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.266
Now. what about
the firefighters?

1422
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.133
Now. I know you're just
trying to help 'em out.

1423
00:56:38.266 --> 00:56:39.767
but like I've said before.

1424
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.633
if the firemen want their land.
they know what they have to do.

1425
00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:45.834
Now. I've got
a lot of work to do.

1426
00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:47.467
so. uh...

1427
00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:50.633
you get your funding.
and I'll get your park.

1428
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.633
Okay.

1429
00:56:52.767 --> 00:56:53.633
Cheese puff?

1430
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.233
Sure.

1431
00:56:56.367 --> 00:56:57.633
De-lish.

1432
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.600
Were you an electrician
in your past life. too?

1433
00:57:06.734 --> 00:57:08.233
Ooh. I might have been.

1434
00:57:08.367 --> 00:57:10.266
I actually learned this stuff
from my dad.

1435
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.300
He made his living
as a fix-it man.

1436
00:57:12.433 --> 00:57:13.500
Ooh. sounds like
my kind of guy.

1437
00:57:13.633 --> 00:57:15.200
Yeah. you'll like him.

1438
00:57:15.333 --> 00:57:17.333
You know.
i-if he's around

1439
00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:18.333
and you're around.

1440
00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:20.200
Um. ahem.
I have a favor to ask you.

1441
00:57:20.333 --> 00:57:21.767
Oh. it depends
what that favor is.

1442
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.333
I couldn't help but notice

1443
00:57:23.467 --> 00:57:25.400
your name on some medals
at the fire station.

1444
00:57:25.533 --> 00:57:26.533
- - You know. 5-
- K/10-
- K races...

1445
00:57:26.667 --> 00:57:28.867
Mm. she noticed my medals.

1446
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.567
Well. I may have been

1447
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.800
known for running
as much as barbecuing.

1448
00:57:32.934 --> 00:57:34.800
A lot of our fundraisers
for the fire department

1449
00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:36.300
were runs. so.

1450
00:57:37.533 --> 00:57:38.633
Help me train for mine?

1451
00:57:38.767 --> 00:57:40.900
Or at least
give me some pointers?

1452
00:57:41.033 --> 00:57:43.433
- Ever run a 10-
- K?

1453
00:57:43.567 --> 00:57:44.667
Walked.

1454
00:57:58.433 --> 00:57:59.300
Oh. no...

1455
00:57:59.433 --> 00:58:01.233
Great minds think alike.

1456
00:58:01.367 --> 00:58:03.433
Uh-huh. Did you do
the stretches I told you to do?

1457
00:58:03.567 --> 00:58:04.700
All of them.

1458
00:58:04.834 --> 00:58:05.734
How far are we going today?

1459
00:58:05.867 --> 00:58:07.500
Until you can't
take another step.

1460
00:58:07.633 --> 00:58:08.567
But then
we still have to get back.

1461
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.200
Well. that's how we train.

1462
00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:11.400
10 K is around six miles.

1463
00:58:11.533 --> 00:58:12.433
Doesn't seem like much.

1464
00:58:12.567 --> 00:58:13.734
but it'll push you
to your limit.

1465
00:58:13.867 --> 00:58:15.967
You'll be lucky
if you do two miles today.

1466
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:16.834
Okay.

1467
00:58:16.967 --> 00:58:19.400
Feeling lucky.
Let's go!

1468
00:58:19.533 --> 00:58:20.467
Oh.

1469
00:58:21.867 --> 00:58:22.800
It's starting to rain.

1470
00:58:22.934 --> 00:58:24.834
It's just a little rain cloud.
It'll pass.

1471
00:58:24.967 --> 00:58:27.233
Pacing is
the most important thing.

1472
00:58:27.367 --> 00:58:29.467
You want your body
to get a rhythm.

1473
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.734
but keep pushing yourself
more than you think.

1474
00:58:31.867 --> 00:58:33.533
and when
your endorphins kick in.

1475
00:58:33.667 --> 00:58:34.667
that'll set your pace.

1476
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.834
The last three kilometres.

1477
00:58:35.967 --> 00:58:37.800
we'll gradually
kick it up a notch.

1478
00:58:37.934 --> 00:58:40.200
All right. well.
what's your pace?

1479
00:58:40.333 --> 00:58:41.367
Is this working for us?

1480
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.500
Naturally. mine's
a little faster than this.

1481
00:58:43.633 --> 00:58:45.300
Hmm.

1482
00:58:47.333 --> 00:58:48.867
I'm just saying.

1483
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.433
You'll never keep up this pace.

1484
00:58:50.567 --> 00:58:51.500
Mm-hmm.

1485
00:59:05.934 --> 00:59:07.734
Nice try.

1486
00:59:07.867 --> 00:59:09.266
I had you.

1487
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.967
Okay. this is not
a 40-yard dash.

1488
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.333
I just wanted to see
what you had in you.

1489
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:16.266
Have you always been
this competitive?

1490
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.367
Well.

1491
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.667
my mom said that when
she was in labor with me.

1492
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.867
the doctor told her she'd be
in labor for five hours.

1493
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.266
and I forced myself out
in 15 minutes.

1494
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.900
You're one to talk.

1495
00:59:26.033 --> 00:59:28.367
Mr. Winner-of-
- - the-
- Barbecue-
- Contest

1496
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.533
five years in a row.

1497
00:59:29.667 --> 00:59:30.734
Oh. speaking of which.

1498
00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:32.667
we still need to set our date
for our grill-off.

1499
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.667
Sauce-off.

1500
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.834
Right. It's a sauce-off now.

1501
00:59:35.967 --> 00:59:37.367
Well. if you're gonna be
using limes.

1502
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.467
you'll never beat me--
just saying.

1503
00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.367
Well. I just learned
that you don't like to lose.

1504
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.400
so I keep pushing back the date

1505
00:59:42.533 --> 00:59:43.967
so I don't have
to hurt your feelings.

1506
00:59:45.467 --> 00:59:48.033
I don't want you
to hurt my feelings either.

1507
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.800
Something tells me
neither of us do.

1508
00:59:57.133 --> 00:59:58.567
So...

1509
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.700
maybe we take it slow.

1510
01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:04.500
Carefully.

1511
01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:06.033
Yeah.

1512
01:00:07.433 --> 01:00:10.000
Well. um.
we'll take the jog slow.

1513
01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:21.033
Okay.

1514
01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.967
Come on.
We're in training.

1515
01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.967
We?

1516
01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.000
You're in training.

1517
01:00:25.133 --> 01:00:26.000
Oh. what?

1518
01:00:26.133 --> 01:00:28.266
Afraid you can't keep up.
slowpoke?

1519
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.600
- ♪ There's a songbird singing
- Oh. it's like that?

1520
01:00:30.734 --> 01:00:32.600
♪ In the whitest snow

1521
01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:35.934
♪ And he's calling everyone
"Come on. let's go" ♪

1522
01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:39.300

On the other side ♪

1523
01:00:39.433 --> 01:00:41.433
♪ Of the road

1524
01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:42.300
Mm!

1525
01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:43.633
Oh. this is good.

1526
01:00:43.767 --> 01:00:45.467
- You are good!
- Right?

1527
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.000
He's not gonna know
what's coming.

1528
01:00:47.133 --> 01:00:49.433
Hand me the smaller Phillips.

1529
01:00:49.567 --> 01:00:50.800
Mm.

1530
01:00:52.467 --> 01:00:53.400
Mm?

1531
01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:54.800
Thank you.

1532
01:00:54.934 --> 01:00:56.367
So...

1533
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.700
you and Jim?

1534
01:00:57.834 --> 01:00:59.433
Me and Jim what?

1535
01:00:59.567 --> 01:01:01.500
Dinners together.

1536
01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:03.967
you fixing his light.
him going on runs with you.

1537
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.400
Come on.
spill the details.

1538
01:01:06.533 --> 01:01:08.000
There's nothing to dish.

1539
01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:09.333
Well. if you ask me--

1540
01:01:09.467 --> 01:01:10.500
Which I didn't.

1541
01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.800
...You look good together.

1542
01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:12.867
You think?

1543
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:13.867
And he's a Pisces.

1544
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.967
This is
a perfect astrological match.

1545
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.567
Plus. Lizzy...

1546
01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.333
she adores you!

1547
01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.700
She can't stop talking
about you. in fact.

1548
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.700
All right. all right. I'm not
gonna poke around anymore.

1549
01:01:26.834 --> 01:01:28.400
But...

1550
01:01:28.533 --> 01:01:31.567
maybe it is time

1551
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.900
to think about
opening your heart again?

1552
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.500
Seems like Jim is ready.

1553
01:01:39.734 --> 01:01:43.834
Has Jim ever dated anyone
since you've known him?

1554
01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.033
Not really.

1555
01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:47.367
A few set-ups here and there.
but nothing really stuck.

1556
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.500
Yeah. I mean. most of them.

1557
01:01:48.633 --> 01:01:51.333
they were really into him. but...

1558
01:01:51.467 --> 01:01:52.867
I think.

1559
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.700
a lot of the time.
he felt like

1560
01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:57.367
they were maybe more interested
in being a mother to Lizzy.

1561
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.100
and it's not
a good enough reason to date.

1562
01:01:59.233 --> 01:02:00.867
Love.

1563
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.667
first and foremost.
has to be present.

1564
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.633
you know. with a vision
of companionship and...

1565
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.033
...mutual interests.

1566
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.600
So...

1567
01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.433
...what about you?

1568
01:02:19.567 --> 01:02:20.700
Do you feel like

1569
01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:23.867
maybe you're ready to move on?

1570
01:02:24.934 --> 01:02:26.433
Maybe you could

1571
01:02:26.567 --> 01:02:29.834
be ready to open your heart
again to love?

1572
01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:34.900
I think I already have.

1573
01:02:37.767 --> 01:02:39.400
Yeah!

1574
01:02:39.533 --> 01:02:41.133
Yeah!

1575
01:02:41.266 --> 01:02:42.400
Ha!

1576
01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:44.633
Don't be silly.
Sit down.

1577
01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:45.900
I have work to do.

1578
01:02:46.033 --> 01:02:48.800
Oh. ho. ho. ho. ho!
That makes me so happy.

1579
01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:51.900
Oh!

1580
01:02:52.033 --> 01:02:55.467
I have been looking into
some more fundraising ideas.

1581
01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.400
Oh. great.

1582
01:02:56.533 --> 01:02:57.767
The State Alliance
for Firefighters

1583
01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.800
are giving special funding

1584
01:02:59.934 --> 01:03:03.033
to whoever wins the Labor Day
Barbecue Contest this year.

1585
01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:05.767
Wait. the infamous
Labor Day Barbecue Contest?

1586
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.533
- Mm-hmm.
- Jim's a five-time champion.

1587
01:03:07.667 --> 01:03:08.934
It's in the bag.

1588
01:03:09.066 --> 01:03:11.834
Yeah. but you know.
anyone can enter. though.

1589
01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:13.567
And?

1590
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.567
So. I entered you.
In a contest.

1591
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.767
Barbecue!

1592
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.700
- You did what?
- Come on!

1593
01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:19.934
It's gonna be so much fun.

1594
01:03:20.066 --> 01:03:21.767
It's the Chief's
retirement party.

1595
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:22.834
It's gonna be a blast.

1596
01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.967
Mo and Janelle.
and a bunch of the others

1597
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.033
are doing it. too.

1598
01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:27.900
Oh. and I have heard
that. you know.

1599
01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:29.834
loves grows stronger
with a little competition.

1600
01:03:29.967 --> 01:03:30.834
don't ya know?

1601
01:03:30.967 --> 01:03:32.867
Oh. does it now?

1602
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.467
We're all fundraising. right?

1603
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.533
This could be a way

1604
01:03:35.667 --> 01:03:37.133
to get little extra money
for the playground.

1605
01:03:37.266 --> 01:03:38.834
if you win.

1606
01:03:38.967 --> 01:03:42.567
Oh! And a great opportunity
to gloat.

1607
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.834
Huh?

1608
01:03:43.967 --> 01:03:45.066
All right. I'll do it.

1609
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.200
Jim and I have
our own little contest going on.

1610
01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:48.700
so this can be it.

1611
01:03:48.834 --> 01:03:49.700
Perfect.

1612
01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:50.967
Oh. and I spoke to the Chief

1613
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.467
about the annual
firefighter's calendar shoot.

1614
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.633
Okay. I need
to get you on payroll.

1615
01:03:55.767 --> 01:03:57.533
I have never met someone
who gets so much stuff done!

1616
01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.533
It's a go.

1617
01:03:58.667 --> 01:03:59.700
Proceeds
from this year's calendar

1618
01:03:59.834 --> 01:04:01.133
will go
to the inclusion playground.

1619
01:04:01.266 --> 01:04:03.000
But what about
the firefighters' gym?

1620
01:04:03.133 --> 01:04:04.133
Oh. it'll be

1621
01:04:04.266 --> 01:04:06.033
a 50/50 kinda deal.
so half of what we sell.

1622
01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:07.867
Are we doing pre-orders?

1623
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.567
Oh! Already on it.

1624
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.533
Okay. everybody.
let's get together.

1625
01:04:16.667 --> 01:04:18.500
Gentlemen. all the helmets
on. please.

1626
01:04:18.633 --> 01:04:20.066
Yeah. fantastic. Even you.

1627
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.667
And the hose. too.
Good. Good. good.

1628
01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.767
- Hey. guys.
- Hey! Chief! Get in there.

1629
01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.667
No. no. no.
My calendar days are over.

1630
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.700
It's okay.

1631
01:04:26.834 --> 01:04:28.667
Oh. hardly!

1632
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.400
Big smiles. everyone.
Big smiles.

1633
01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.667
Yeah. Excellent.

1634
01:04:34.633 --> 01:04:35.500
Back to back.

1635
01:04:35.633 --> 01:04:37.233
Fantastic.

1636
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.266
Oh. that's so good!

1637
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.300
Girls. center around
the dog a little bit.

1638
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.266
Put your helmet on.

1639
01:04:50.266 --> 01:04:51.467

That was great.

1653
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.700
Yeah. I think I had
the arm workout of a lifetime.

1654
01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:32.367
Lizzy's small.
but she's solid.

1655
01:05:33.633 --> 01:05:35.133
Well. thank you so much.

1656
01:05:35.266 --> 01:05:36.533
- Oh. you better thank Chief.
- Thank you. Chief Reed.

1657
01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:38.200
- Really.
- You're welcome.

1658
01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:39.767
Julia-- she's family.

1659
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.467
so we do what we gotta do.

1660
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.533
And some good news--

1661
01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:45.066
we raised more money
than expected.

1662
01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.066
From the pre-sales?

1663
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.200
Well. the calendar shoot.

1664
01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:49.300
and the State Alliance
of Firefighters--

1665
01:05:49.433 --> 01:05:50.166
they donated as well.

1666
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.233
- Really?
- Yeah.

1667
01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:53.367
I guess they wanted
to honor my retirement.

1668
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.467
and to bring in the new chief--
whoever that might be--

1669
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.767
with a little more energy.

1670
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.200
We got a PST.

1671
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:02.734
- Want to ride with?
- Oh. no.

1672
01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:04.834
I wouldn't want to get
in the way of an emergency.

1673
01:06:04.967 --> 01:06:06.400
No. I wouldn't suggest it
if it was.

1674
01:06:06.533 --> 01:06:07.734
Come on. when's
the last time you rode

1675
01:06:07.867 --> 01:06:09.333
in the back of a fire truck?

1676
01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:10.700
Um. never.

1677
01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:11.767
What about Lizzy?

1678
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.166
She has a playdate
with Julia.

1679
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.633
Okay. let's do it.

1680
01:06:14.767 --> 01:06:16.600
Yeah. all right.

1681
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.133
If it's not an emergency.
why are you using the siren?

1682
01:06:21.266 --> 01:06:22.200
It keeps us sharp!

1683
01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:25.400
Trust me. this is a half
our emergency speed.

1684
01:06:26.533 --> 01:06:27.433
You having fun?

1685
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.300
Yeah. A lot of fun.

1686
01:06:36.967 --> 01:06:38.667
I think
they're getting married.

1687
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.333
Don't jump. sweetie!
Don't jump. Just stay there!

1688
01:06:41.467 --> 01:06:43.400
Stay there. Good!
You're such a good girl!

1689
01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:44.500
Oh! No! Don't move.

1690
01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:47.233
Oh. Mommy's called for help.
Just wait.

1691
01:06:47.367 --> 01:06:48.200
Stay there.

1692
01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.200
Oh!

1693
01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.133
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you!

1694
01:06:52.266 --> 01:06:53.367
Oh. ho. ho!

1695
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Oh. thank you. thank you.
thank you. thank you. thank you.

1696
01:06:57.633 --> 01:06:59.433
Thank you so much for coming.

1697
01:06:59.567 --> 01:07:01.734
Her name is "Streisand".

1698
01:07:01.867 --> 01:07:03.834
Big fan.
She's gonna have a comeback.

1699
01:07:03.967 --> 01:07:06.300
She's up there.
You've got to get her.

1700
01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:07.300
- This is Betty-
- Anne.

1701
01:07:07.433 --> 01:07:09.433
She works over at the bakery
on Sixth.

1702
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:10.767
Thank God. it's you. Jim.
Can you get her?

1703
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.300
First things first.

1704
01:07:12.433 --> 01:07:14.200
What about that door
on the porch?

1705
01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:16.233
Bruce sealed that off
years ago.

1706
01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:18.467
It's a fake door.
It doesn't work.

1707
01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.200
- So how'd she get up there?
- I don't know.

1708
01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:22.734
But look at that face!

1709
01:07:22.867 --> 01:07:24.333
She's terrified!

1710
01:07:24.467 --> 01:07:25.467
You have to get her.

1711
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.633
And you're sure

1712
01:07:26.767 --> 01:07:28.767
there's no way in
through that door?

1713
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.233
It's decorative door.

1714
01:07:30.367 --> 01:07:33.834
Never a dull moment.
Mo. Hit me with Paws of Life.

1715
01:07:36.734 --> 01:07:37.667
You got this.

1716
01:07:39.633 --> 01:07:40.567
Ooh.

1717
01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:43.233
You ready?

1718
01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:43.967
Yeah.

1719
01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.567
- Got me. Mo?
- Oh. yeah.

1720
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.567
All right. brother.

1721
01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:53.300
I'm getting too old for this.

1722
01:07:56.433 --> 01:07:57.800
Hi. kitty-kitty.

1723
01:07:57.934 --> 01:07:59.266
Huh?

1724
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.266
Hey. kitty-kitty-kitty.

1725
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.700
Go figure.

1726
01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:04.333
The door works.

1727
01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:05.900
It works!

1728
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.700
Whatcha doing. Dad?

1729
01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:24.834
I'm just reading the cookbook
that Gia gave me.

1730
01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:26.333
I thought you already knew
about cooking.

1731
01:08:26.467 --> 01:08:28.734
Well. a master is always
learning his craft.

1732
01:08:28.867 --> 01:08:31.000
Knowledge is everything.

1733
01:08:31.133 --> 01:08:32.834
I still think
Gia's gonna beat you

1734
01:08:32.967 --> 01:08:33.934
in that contest.

1735
01:08:34.066 --> 01:08:36.533
Her mac and cheese
was really good.

1736
01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:38.333
I thought
I was the mac-and-cheese king!

1737
01:08:38.467 --> 01:08:39.667
Not anymore!

1738
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.867
Not anymore?

1739
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.934
You don't like
my mac and cheese?

1740
01:08:43.066 --> 01:08:44.500
No? Well. you're gonna like

1741
01:08:44.633 --> 01:08:46.633
your bed even better.
'cause it's bedtime.

1742
01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:48.767
Ready?

1743
01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:37.533
Are you okay?

1744
01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:38.900
I've never been better.

1745
01:09:40.066 --> 01:09:42.000
Oh. well.
look who we have here.

1746
01:09:42.133 --> 01:09:42.967
You ready?

1747
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.700
Your coach do a good job
training you?

1748
01:09:44.834 --> 01:09:45.934
I think so.

1749
01:09:46.066 --> 01:09:47.033
Ooh. so how
are our numbers looking?

1750
01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.433
Yeah. Good. Really good.

1751
01:09:48.567 --> 01:09:49.633
We actually a lot of donations

1752
01:09:49.767 --> 01:09:51.033
from people
that aren't even running.

1753
01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:52.533
Ooh.

1754
01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:53.800
You looking for someone?

1755
01:09:53.934 --> 01:09:54.667
What?

1756
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.734
No.

1757
01:09:55.867 --> 01:09:56.734
Don't worry.

1758
01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:57.834
He'll show.

1759
01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:00.700
Runners to your starting marks.

1760
01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:02.700
- Ohh...
- Go get 'em. honey.

1761
01:10:02.834 --> 01:10:04.100
- This is it.
- You got this!

1762
01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.700
I'll be rooting for you.
right here.

1763
01:10:06.834 --> 01:10:07.967
See you at the finish line!

1764
01:10:09.033 --> 01:10:10.000
You ready?

1765
01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:13.033
On your marks...

1766
01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:14.600
get set...

1767
01:10:14.734 --> 01:10:16.567
go!

1768
01:10:17.934 --> 01:10:20.033
You're fast!

1769
01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:35.967
Come on. slowpoke.

1770
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.633
Hey! Who are you
calling a slowpoke?

1771
01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:38.633
Sorry I'm late.

1772
01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.066
Yeah. you are really late.

1773
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.700
but considering you've already
caught up with me--

1774
01:10:42.834 --> 01:10:44.033
Yeah. I had a meeting.

1775
01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:45.567
Mm. That sounds important.

1776
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.667
It was.

1777
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.967
Guess who
you're looking at?

1778
01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.867
Uh. a really hot firefighter

1779
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.567
who's kicking my butt
in this race?

1780
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.600
Yes.

1781
01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:53.900
But you're also looking at

1782
01:10:54.033 --> 01:10:55.934
Maple Plain's
brand-new Fire Chief.

1783
01:10:56.066 --> 01:10:57.000
What?

1784
01:10:57.133 --> 01:10:58.667
No stopping!
It's a marathon!

1785
01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.700
That's so exciting! All right!
- It is.

1786
01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:02.767
And I also learned
that you set a date

1787
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.100
for our grill-off.
and didn't tell me?

1788
01:11:05.233 --> 01:11:06.767
Okay. look.
Karen signed me up. okay?

1789
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.700
I meant to tell you.
but get ready to lose.

1790
01:11:09.834 --> 01:11:10.834
No. she didn't.

1791
01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:12.467
Oh. yes. she did.

1792
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.700
Grill master. Right here.

1793
01:11:13.834 --> 01:11:16.600
- Yeah?
- Can't beat me. Can't beat me!

1794
01:11:16.734 --> 01:11:18.100
Can't beat me!

1795
01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:36.567
How do you feel?

1796
01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.934
Like I won't walk
for two weeks.

1797
01:11:39.066 --> 01:11:40.033
But exhilarated.

1798
01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:41.600
Hey. that means
it was a good run.

1799
01:11:41.734 --> 01:11:43.934
I mean.
look at all these people.

1800
01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.433
We raised a lot of money.

1801
01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.734
We did.

1802
01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:49.000
Oh. hey!

1803
01:11:49.133 --> 01:11:51.633
Oh. there they are.
Let's go and see how they did.

1804
01:11:51.767 --> 01:11:53.166
How'd you do?

1805
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.500
Oh. first.

1806
01:11:54.633 --> 01:11:56.133
- What?
- No. I took a shortcut.

1807
01:11:56.266 --> 01:11:58.000
But I still crossed
the finish line.

1808
01:11:58.133 --> 01:11:59.767
How did you do?

1809
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.166
Top ten!

1810
01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.166
- Nice!
- Wow!

1811
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.100
What about me?

1812
01:12:04.233 --> 01:12:05.633
You better start
being nice to me.

1813
01:12:05.767 --> 01:12:08.467
since I'm gonna be
your new boss.

1814
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.600
- What? Really?
- Yeah. I took the job.

1815
01:12:10.734 --> 01:12:11.834
- Congratulations. man.
- Oh.

1816
01:12:13.133 --> 01:12:14.533
You deserve it.

1817
01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:16.800
Excuse me. Hey.

1818
01:12:16.934 --> 01:12:19.200
Yeah?

1819
01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:20.900
Are you serious?

1820
01:12:22.233 --> 01:12:24.767
That's amazing!
Thank you.

1821
01:12:25.834 --> 01:12:26.700
Congratulations.

1822
01:12:26.834 --> 01:12:28.000
That was my office.

1823
01:12:28.133 --> 01:12:30.033
They tallied
the results from the race.

1824
01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:31.100
And?

1825
01:12:31.233 --> 01:12:32.700
We did it.

1826
01:12:35.967 --> 01:12:37.767
That's so great!

1827
01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.100
You're getting a park. Julia.

1828
01:12:39.233 --> 01:12:40.467
This is because of you.

1829
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.233
No. Gia. look at these smiles.
It's because of you.

1830
01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.467
Lizzy?

1831
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.967
We did it!

1832
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.133
Yeah!

1833
01:12:48.266 --> 01:12:49.867
Come here!

1834
01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.100
We did it!
We did it!

1835
01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:55.867
Gimme a high-five.

1836
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.100
Yeah!

1837
01:13:01.233 --> 01:13:02.166
Oh. Chief Reed?

1838
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.033
Hi. What are you doing here?

1839
01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:05.467
I was. uh. up seeing Don.

1840
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.767
Oh.

1841
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.133
How'd it go?

1842
01:13:08.266 --> 01:13:09.467
He's giving us the lot.

1843
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.834
For the gym.

1844
01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:12.200
That's fantastic.

1845
01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:15.066
Yeah. Farewell gift to my crew.

1846
01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.800
How'd you convince him?

1847
01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:19.066
Well. I told him
what he wanted to hear.

1848
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.633
Support for
his mayor candidacy?

1849
01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:21.734
Let's hope he makes

1850
01:13:21.867 --> 01:13:24.033
a better mayor
than a head of Parks and Rec.

1851
01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.100
Are you going up?

1852
01:13:25.233 --> 01:13:27.200
I am. We got the park.
Thanks to you guys.

1853
01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:29.100
That's fantastic.

1854
01:13:29.233 --> 01:13:30.200
Well. go get 'em--

1855
01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:31.567
and I'll see you
at the barbecue?

1856
01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.533
- Sounds good. Bye.
- Okay.

1857
01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:35.934
Yes.

1858
01:13:36.066 --> 01:13:37.200
Yeah. no.
The papers are all signed.

1859
01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:39.133
You can do what you want
with 'em.

1860
01:13:39.266 --> 01:13:42.500
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It's all legally yours.

1861
01:13:42.633 --> 01:13:44.967
Yeah. Thank you
for your support.

1862
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.000
Okay. Bye.

1863
01:13:47.133 --> 01:13:48.467
Sorry to interrupt.

1864
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.500
I just couldn't wait to find out
what the next steps are.

1865
01:13:50.633 --> 01:13:51.500
When do we start digging?

1866
01:13:51.633 --> 01:13:52.700
Gia. have a seat.

1867
01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:53.567
Okay.

1868
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.734
Is everything okay?

1869
01:13:55.867 --> 01:13:57.533
I saw Chief Reed outside.

1870
01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.433
Heard you got the firefighters'
support for your candidacy.

1871
01:13:59.567 --> 01:14:00.500
I did. It's huge.

1872
01:14:00.633 --> 01:14:02.567
Gets me over the finish line.

1873
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.800
Yes. well.
speaking of finish lines.

1874
01:14:03.934 --> 01:14:06.700
my office told me
that the funds raised from

1875
01:14:06.834 --> 01:14:09.100
the inclusion playground race
was what us to 100K.

1876
01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:11.633
Well. it's not enough.

1877
01:14:11.767 --> 01:14:13.200
N-No. it is.

1878
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:15.100
because the firefighters.
they donated to it.

1879
01:14:15.233 --> 01:14:17.867
we raised more funds together...

1880
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.967
Do you want the bad news
or the worse news?

1881
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.033
The bad news?

1882
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.500
The bad news is...

1883
01:14:24.633 --> 01:14:26.200
the land for your park
was assigned.

1884
01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:28.633
Another group beat you
to the finish line.

1885
01:14:28.767 --> 01:14:30.066
no pun intended.

1886
01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.500
Another group. Who?

1887
01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.567
Well. that's irrelevant.

1888
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.867
Not to me. it isn't.

1889
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.500
Let me go out on a limb here
and guess.

1890
01:14:38.633 --> 01:14:40.100
The Cherwin family?

1891
01:14:40.233 --> 01:14:41.900
Yes.

1892
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.066
And the worse?

1893
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.734
Well. the worse news
is that. uh.

1894
01:14:45.867 --> 01:14:48.233
your firefighter. Jim Dunlap.
the Chief.

1895
01:14:48.367 --> 01:14:52.133
well. when he made
his donation to the city.

1896
01:14:52.266 --> 01:14:53.734
he made me sign
some legal papers.

1897
01:14:53.867 --> 01:14:56.166
guarantees and stuff.

1898
01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.600
and when he learned

1899
01:14:57.734 --> 01:14:58.667
that the park
couldn't happen right away.

1900
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.266
he. uh...

1901
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.934
he withdrew all his support.

1902
01:15:02.066 --> 01:15:05.667
and took back
all your so-called funding.

1903
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.934
I mean. he wasn't shy
about what he wanted for them.

1904
01:15:09.066 --> 01:15:12.166
Made me tie up everything
real tight for him.

1905
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.000
It just goes to show ya.

1906
01:15:14.133 --> 01:15:16.133
well. you try
and be nice to people.

1907
01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:17.934
they bite you in the butt.

1908
01:15:18.066 --> 01:15:21.166
People aren't what they seem.

1909
01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.800
I'm sorry.

1910
01:15:23.967 --> 01:15:26.867
Yeah. Me too.

1911
01:15:29.033 --> 01:15:30.100
Are you ready?

1912
01:15:30.233 --> 01:15:31.667
Yeah.

1913
01:15:32.734 --> 01:15:34.133
Now. it's a lot of turquoise--

1914
01:15:34.266 --> 01:15:35.900
It's a lot of turquoise.

1915
01:15:36.033 --> 01:15:37.066
Do you love it?

1916
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.333
But I love it.

1917
01:15:39.767 --> 01:15:41.266
And these swings over here.
they have...

1918
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.000
Gia?

1919
01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.200
There you are.

1920
01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:09.967
Here I am.

1921
01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:12.900
Okay. can you just
hear me out a minute?

1922
01:16:13.033 --> 01:16:14.867
Hear you out?

1923
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.333
What do you want to say?

1924
01:16:16.467 --> 01:16:17.800
You got your promotion.

1925
01:16:17.934 --> 01:16:19.767
You got your gym.

1926
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.233
You tried to help me.
but I got screwed.

1927
01:16:23.266 --> 01:16:26.200
I know it wasn't by you.
it was by my boss. but...

1928
01:16:28.266 --> 01:16:30.934
...it stung.

1929
01:16:31.066 --> 01:16:35.834
Knowing that you took back
all the fundraising--

1930
01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:37.767
funding
that we raised together--

1931
01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.300
as soon as you heard

1932
01:16:39.433 --> 01:16:41.133
the inclusion playground
was gonna be delayed.

1933
01:16:41.266 --> 01:16:44.066
That playground was important.

1934
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.266
It was important
to Mo and Karen.

1935
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.367
to Julia.

1936
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.333
And it was...

1937
01:16:52.467 --> 01:16:54.900
it was important to me.

1938
01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.867
It was closure.

1939
01:16:58.967 --> 01:17:01.867
All that hard work
for nothing.

1940
01:17:04.934 --> 01:17:06.133
I could see how that appears.

1941
01:17:06.266 --> 01:17:07.767
Okay. Look.

1942
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.266
What I've learned
these past few weeks

1943
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.800
is that you never know
what's holding you back

1944
01:17:12.934 --> 01:17:15.200
and when to let go.

1945
01:17:15.333 --> 01:17:18.400
Okay. look. you showed me

1946
01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:21.433
that family and Lizzy
are the most important things.

1947
01:17:21.567 --> 01:17:24.800
and if a door opens
for a better opportunity.

1948
01:17:24.934 --> 01:17:27.867
I sure as heck
am gonna walk through it.

1949
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.433
Just like you did
by moving here

1950
01:17:29.567 --> 01:17:32.433
and unselfishly making
everybody's lives better.

1951
01:17:32.567 --> 01:17:33.433
'Kay. that playground--

1952
01:17:33.567 --> 01:17:36.066
There isn't gonna be
a playground. Jim.

1953
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.433
Okay. In theory...

1954
01:17:38.567 --> 01:17:39.867
if I had

1955
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.900
20 spaces in a parking lot.

1956
01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:42.967
would that fit?

1957
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.100
In theory.

1958
01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:48.734
I suppose. if there were
enough handicap spots--

1959
01:17:49.533 --> 01:17:51.734
What... What is this?

1960
01:17:53.533 --> 01:17:56.000
I had Karen
and one of our architects

1961
01:17:56.133 --> 01:17:57.233
change up the plans a bit.

1962
01:17:57.367 --> 01:17:59.433
The gym is not as big
as I had hoped.

1963
01:17:59.567 --> 01:18:01.133
but it's big enough.

1964
01:18:01.266 --> 01:18:04.066
And there's plenty of room
for the playground.

1965
01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.266
I-- I don't understand.

1966
01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.533
Don signed it over
to the fire department.

1967
01:18:07.667 --> 01:18:10.333
We can do whatever we want.

1968
01:18:13.033 --> 01:18:14.300
Thank you!

1969
01:18:14.433 --> 01:18:17.066
Amazing! Thank you!

1970
01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.367
I mean.
I got more parking lots--

1971
01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.100
There's a big one. in the back.

1972
01:18:22.233 --> 01:18:24.767
It could fit
the playground and--

1973
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.367
No way.

1974
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.834
Old Betty's back in business.

1975
01:18:44.967 --> 01:18:47.533
Oh. ho. Look at you. Wow.

1976
01:18:47.667 --> 01:18:48.533
And she's working.

1977
01:18:48.667 --> 01:18:50.800
Working?
She's doing more than that.

1978
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:53.000
She's gonna
bring Mama home a trophy.

1979
01:18:54.967 --> 01:18:57.266
- What is that?
- Eggplant.

1980
01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.834
- On a barbecue?
- Would seem so.

1981
01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.166
Ahh.

1982
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.066
Going old-school over here--
classic burgers on my grill.

1983
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.066
You've got
to be kidding me. Mo.

1984
01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.500
How the heck do you think

1985
01:19:06.633 --> 01:19:08.000
you're gonna beat Jim
with burgers?

1986
01:19:08.133 --> 01:19:09.433
They're veggie.

1987
01:19:11.133 --> 01:19:12.033
The heck is happening
to you two?

1988
01:19:12.166 --> 01:19:15.066
Turning my world upside-down.

1989
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.400
Think your world's
turning upside-down with that?

1990
01:19:16.533 --> 01:19:17.967
Wait till you see
Karen's color--

1991
01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.100
Eh. Stop right there.

1992
01:19:19.233 --> 01:19:20.934
You're breaking my ears.

1993
01:19:24.734 --> 01:19:26.100
Thanks. though. Gia. for...

1994
01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:30.333
you know-- the gym we got
and. uh. helping my brother out.

1995
01:19:30.467 --> 01:19:32.500
Mo's your brother?

1996
01:19:32.633 --> 01:19:33.567
Ah. I tease him like he is.

1997
01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.533
And that kid over there.

1998
01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:37.934
and that cuter-than-ever
extended family of mine.

1999
01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:40.200
you just changed her life.

2000
01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:42.967
She gets to play on a playground
with her friends.

2001
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.567
And that little munchkin.

2002
01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.000
well. you just made her
a very happy little girl.

2003
01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:49.166
How so?

2004
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.400
Happy parent
makes a happy kid...

2005
01:19:51.533 --> 01:19:53.133
makes a happy family.

2006
01:19:55.066 --> 01:19:56.100
No. it's perfect.

2007
01:19:57.367 --> 01:19:58.333
Group hug.

2008
01:19:59.433 --> 01:20:02.033
Group hug! Come on.
I said group hug. Bring it in.

2009
01:20:03.066 --> 01:20:03.934
This feels like a trap.

2010
01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:05.033
Yeah.

2011
01:20:09.266 --> 01:20:10.834
I gotta go check on my meat.

2012
01:20:10.967 --> 01:20:13.333
She's gotta be next.

2013
01:20:13.467 --> 01:20:15.233
- For what?
- Finding a life partner.

2014
01:20:15.367 --> 01:20:17.166
We're not doing
that hugging thing again.

2015
01:20:18.633 --> 01:20:21.000
Hey! You get away.
you cheater. Go.

2016
01:20:21.133 --> 01:20:23.066
Go!

2017
01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:40.100
Thirsty?

2018
01:20:40.233 --> 01:20:42.266
How did you know?

2019
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.033
Gonna beat my dad?

2020
01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:45.300
I wish I could say
I will.

2021
01:20:45.433 --> 01:20:47.433
but I'm actually
not that confident.

2022
01:20:47.567 --> 01:20:48.934
Hey!

2023
01:20:49.066 --> 01:20:50.300
How's it going over there?

2024
01:20:50.433 --> 01:20:52.100
Ten more minutes.

2025
01:20:52.233 --> 01:20:54.633
Ha-ha. We'll see.

2026
01:21:00.967 --> 01:21:03.033
Here I go. Mo.

2027
01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:05.200
- Burger. Let's give it a try.
- Yeah.

2028
01:21:08.066 --> 01:21:09.433
Mm!

2029
01:21:09.567 --> 01:21:11.233
Are you trying
something new. Mo?

2030
01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.233
Veggie.

2031
01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.500
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm retiring.

2032
01:21:17.467 --> 01:21:18.834
Janelle. partner.
what do you got for me?

2033
01:21:18.967 --> 01:21:20.233
Good old ribs.

2034
01:21:20.367 --> 01:21:22.367
The sauce is my secret.

2035
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.133
Okay. Here we go.

2036
01:21:25.633 --> 01:21:27.100
Very nice.

2037
01:21:27.233 --> 01:21:29.166
Very. very nice. Mm-hmm.

2038
01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.834
Gia? Whatcha got here?

2039
01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:32.500
- Eggplant.
- Eggplant?

2040
01:21:32.633 --> 01:21:34.500
Looks like ribs.
but it's not.

2041
01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:36.400
- Does look like ribs.
- Okay. here we go.

2042
01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.400
But does it taste like ribs?

2043
01:21:42.433 --> 01:21:44.300
- Surprisingly good!
- Right?

2044
01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:45.967
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

2045
01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:49.000
And now. our defending champion.

2046
01:21:49.133 --> 01:21:50.400
Jim.

2047
01:21:50.533 --> 01:21:52.367
- You know it.
- What do we got here?

2048
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.967
Just some ribs.
I charcoaled it.

2049
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:54.967
You know what I'm saying?

2050
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.834
I put some special
barbecue sauce.

2051
01:21:56.967 --> 01:21:58.300
for this special occasion.

2052
01:21:58.433 --> 01:21:59.967
- And it's moist--
- Ah.

2053
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:01.233
- And it's not eggplant.
- Always moist.

2054
01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:02.967
- Well...
- Oh. ho...

2055
01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:03.967
You are the champ.

2056
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.467
Let's see what you got
this year.

2057
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.100
- Talk to me. Chief.
- Mm!

2058
01:22:11.233 --> 01:22:13.033
This guy. I tell ya.

2059
01:22:14.567 --> 01:22:16.000
Okay. All right.

2060
01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.100
I've made my decisions.

2061
01:22:20.233 --> 01:22:21.967
So. I think we have

2062
01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.233
an unexpected finalist here. everyone.

2063
01:22:23.367 --> 01:22:25.300
Third place goes to--

2064
01:22:25.433 --> 01:22:28.033
let's give a round of applause
to Janelle.

2065
01:22:28.166 --> 01:22:29.367
Whoo!

2066
01:22:32.133 --> 01:22:33.834
- No hard feelings. Mo.
- Yeah. yeah.

2067
01:22:33.967 --> 01:22:35.400
Before we move on.

2068
01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:37.567
I'd like to talk a little bit
about Gia Summers--

2069
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.600
a woman
who breezed into town

2070
01:22:39.734 --> 01:22:43.100
and. well. championed
a new inclusion playground.

2071
01:22:43.233 --> 01:22:44.533
So. first of all.
I'd like to give you

2072
01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:46.066
a round of applause for that.

2073
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.166
Thank you. Thank you.

2074
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.834
Whoo!

2075
01:22:49.967 --> 01:22:50.867
But...

2076
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.367
unfortunately.

2077
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.934
it's second prize for you.
and not first.

2078
01:22:55.066 --> 01:22:56.367
But well done!

2079
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.934
And now...

2080
01:23:01.066 --> 01:23:03.467
the winner of
the Labor Day Barbecue.

2081
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.367
- the Master Contraster...
- Mm-hmm.

2082
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.066
...The king
of barbecue cling.

2083
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.567
the ribs that need
the most bibs--

2084
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.567
Most of 'em.

2085
01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.400
...The new Chief Jim Dunlap!

2086
01:23:13.533 --> 01:23:15.400
Whoo!

2087
01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:22.333
Yes. yes. yes. Okay...

2088
01:23:22.467 --> 01:23:26.400
Let's go see.
Come with me. okay?

2089
01:23:26.533 --> 01:23:28.600
Here we go.

2090
01:23:28.734 --> 01:23:30.300
- Second place!
- Not bad.

2091
01:23:30.433 --> 01:23:32.333
Not bad!

2092
01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.533
I am so glad you moved
to this neighborhood.

2093
01:23:36.667 --> 01:23:38.667
- Me too.
- Me too!

2094
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.300
I think yours was good.

2095
01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:44.100
Don't tell my dad--
it's complicated.

2096
01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:45.367
I promise.

2097
01:23:48.633 --> 01:23:50.600
Come here. you!

2098
01:23:56.734 --> 01:23:57.967
She was exhausted.

2099
01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:01.233
Looked like Mo was. too.
That was nice they took Lizzy.

2100
01:24:01.367 --> 01:24:03.533
What. you didn't hear Lizzy
begging for a sleepover?

2101
01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:04.533
If I didn't say yes.

2102
01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:06.467
I would be hearing about it
for a year.

2103
01:24:07.633 --> 01:24:09.300
Sounds like
the party's still going on.

2104
01:24:09.433 --> 01:24:10.333
Yeah. Sounds like it.

2105
01:24:12.166 --> 01:24:13.467
So how about it?

2106
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.667
A dance?

2107
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.066
Here?

2108
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.066
Yeah. why not?

2109
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.633
Okay. let's do it.

2110
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.567
♪ ...And you are mine

2111
01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:27.333
♪ And that's fine

2112
01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:36.467
♪ I will protect you

2113
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.433
♪ All the time

2114
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.233
♪ All the time

2115
01:24:44.834 --> 01:24:46.700
♪ Because you're mine

2116
01:24:46.834 --> 01:24:49.000
Look. a rainbow.

2117
01:24:49.133 --> 01:24:52.400
Did you know that rainbows
actually are circles.

2118
01:24:52.533 --> 01:24:55.633
but they just look like
arches from the ground?

2119
01:24:55.767 --> 01:24:57.367
I've said it before
and I'm gonna say it again--

2120
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.500
is there anything
you're not an expert at?

2121
01:24:59.633 --> 01:25:02.133
Well. clearly barbecuing.

2122
01:25:02.266 --> 01:25:03.667
Right! You're not good at that!
How do I keep forgetting?

2123
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.734
I am so gonna beat you still.

2124
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.033
Well. it seems like my daughter
liked it. though.

2125
01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:10.633
Nah. she was just saying that.

2126
01:25:10.767 --> 01:25:12.233
I don't know.

2127
01:25:12.367 --> 01:25:13.600
