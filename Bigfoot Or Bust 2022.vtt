He's about 500 yards up.

This time. we're gonna get him.

You gotta meet me at

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:48.254

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.585

00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:28.459
I thought you were Bigfoot!

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:31.528
- Quit you're talking.

19
00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:32.496
- Where?

20
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:33.926

21
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:34.894
Go. go. go.

00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:37.270
Get going.

23
00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:46.840
- He's not here!

24
00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.545
- What do you
mean he's not there?

25
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.678
- He got away.

26
00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.186
- Oh. no. he got away.

27
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.847
Well. you know what?

28
00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:56.784
Next time we're gonna give
him the red carpet treatment.

29
00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:01.921

treatment?

37
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.897
- Hey Penny. it's Dr. Dawn.

38
00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:03.965
- Hi. Dr. Dawn.
- How are you?

39
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.165
- I'm doing great. how are you?

40
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.068
- Listen. there's been
a bunch of Bigfoot

41
00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:09.872
sightings in the area.

42
00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:11.511
I'm so excited.

43
00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:14.646
And I really think that
he's close this time.

44
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:17.781
So I've been talking to some
of the girls from the team.

45
00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:19.981
and I thought what we'd do
is we'd get together again.

46
00:06:20.016 --> 00:06:22.720
I really think this
time we might find him.

47
00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:26.658
- Oh my God. I just
had the craziest dream.

48
00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:30.596
I dreamt Bigfoot was stalking
me. and there he was.

49
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:32.125
- That's kind of an omen.

50
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.797
- I think it is.

51
00:06:33.832 --> 00:06:34.930
- So the girls are
all getting ready

52
00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:36.800
to come tomorrow morning.

53
00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.132
I've also got an ad on
Craigslist for a new girl.

54
00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:41.640
So we'll meet here
tomorrow. nine o'clock?

55
00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:43.202
- Okay. that's perfect.

56
00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.478
See you then.

57
00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:45.171
- Bye.

58
00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:48.482
- Pull!

59
00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.045
Pull!

60
00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:53.817
Pull!

- You never miss.

67
00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.808
Whoa. whoa. easy.
easy.

68
00:07:17.843 --> 00:07:18.743
Don't shoot.

69
00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:21.207
- What are you doing here?

70
00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:22.846
- Just though I'd
check on my sis.

71
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:23.880
- Yeah. well. I'm
doing just fine.

72
00:07:23.915 --> 00:07:25.849
You can go now.

73
00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:28.016
- Mm. yeah. you seem real fine.

74
00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:31.184
God. you're still so angry.

75
00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.220
I mean. Jess. it's
been five years.

76
00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.156
When are you gonna let this go?

77
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:38.290
- When are you gonna give a
shit that our father's dead?

78
00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:42.030
- You don't think that this
kills me every single day. huh?

79
00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:43.867
It was a horrible accident.

80
00:07:43.902 --> 00:07:45.704
He was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

81
00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:50.709
- It was about a bunch of
greedy hunters out for Bigfoot.

82
00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:53.008
And again. he got away.

83
00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:55.681
And our father lost
his life because of it.

84
00:07:55.716 --> 00:07:57.045
And it's gonna happen
to somebody else

85
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.850
unless this damn
beast is caught.

86
00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:08.122
- All right. why
don't you get him?

87
00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:09.695
- What?

88
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.158
- Come on. Jess.

89
00:08:11.193 --> 00:08:13.028
You're the best shot in
this neck of the woods.

90
00:08:13.063 --> 00:08:15.063
If anyone could hunt
him down. it's you.

91
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.538
Do it.

92
00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:20.200
Do it for dad.

93
00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:28.307
- I love you. Billy.
- Love you too. kiddo.

94
00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:32.652

- Oh. I'm so excited.

108
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.015
- Good to see you again.
- Hi. Tilly.

109
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.148
- You look great.

110
00:10:13.183 --> 00:10:14.314
- And this is. Daisy.

111
00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:15.788
- Hi!

112
00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:17.251
I'm Daisy May.

113
00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:19.418
- She answered the
add in Craigslist.

114
00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:21.255
and I thought she was perfect.

115
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.960
So Daisy's not done this before.

116
00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:24.423
so we're gonna teach her.

117
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:27.965
- This is my first
time. first time.

118
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.329
- And then. Tilly. you're
gonna be showing her

119
00:10:29.364 --> 00:10:30.198
how to do the
sword and the toys.

120
00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:31.936
- Yes. I am.

121
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:33.267
- Yeah.
- Oh.

122
00:10:33.302 --> 00:10:35.137
Yeah.

123
00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:36.435
- And Penny. you're gonna
be showing her how we

124
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.843
use our sensuality to--
- To be sexy.

125
00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:40.307
- Oh. I heard he likes booties.

126
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.410
And I heard Bigfoot
likes big titties.

127
00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:46.280
Right?

128
00:10:47.448 --> 00:10:49.019
- So we're gonna seduce him out.

129
00:10:49.054 --> 00:10:50.955
but this time we're
gonna find him.

130
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.188
And I even heard that
they've had these wolf calls.

131
00:10:53.223 --> 00:10:54.728
like woo. hoo. hoo!

132
00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:57.225
You know. the Bigfoot
making noises.

133
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.096
- But like is the local
news gonna be here?

134
00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:01.493
Is like CNN?

135
00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:04.133
- Oh. when we get
selfies with Bigfoot.

136
00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:06.069
and then when we
actually interview him.

137
00:11:06.104 --> 00:11:07.906
oh. we're gonna
have so much press.

138
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.743
- But like how long do
you think it's gonna be

139
00:11:09.778 --> 00:11:11.107
before we get famous?

140
00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:12.438
- Oh. right away.

141
00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:13.780
- Yeah. it's instant.
- Right away.

142
00:11:13.815 --> 00:11:15.243
- Then I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

143
00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:16.948
- So do you guys have
outfits for the hunt?

144
00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:18.752
- I do. I do. I do.

145
00:11:18.787 --> 00:11:20.116
- Yeah. sexy stuff?

146
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:21.249
Okay. let's change.
- Let's do it.

147
00:11:21.284 --> 00:11:22.250
- Okay.
- Let's go.

148
00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:31.193
- Hi. my name is Penny Blossom.

149
00:11:31.228 --> 00:11:33.525
and I'm an internet influencer.

150
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.396
I have a lot of
people following me.

151
00:11:36.431 --> 00:11:40.136
and I have sponsors that pay
me money because they like me.

152
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:42.006
They think I'm cute.

153
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:44.778
But the main reason is I
get visited from celebrities

154
00:11:44.813 --> 00:11:47.407
that have passed away
and they come and see me

155
00:11:47.442 --> 00:11:49.244
because they tell
me I'm special.

156
00:11:50.885 --> 00:11:53.347
- Hi. I'm Dr. Dawn.

157
00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:57.483
This is gonna be my third
expedition to find Bigfoot.

158
00:11:57.518 --> 00:12:01.223
And this time we're
gonna find him.

159
00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:03.093
I'm so excited.

160
00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:05.194
I've actually been an
enthusiastic about Bigfoot

161
00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:07.559
since I was a little
girl in England.

162
00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:10.397
and I was part of
the Girl Guides.

163
00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:12.333
Girl Scouts over here.
but that. you know.

164
00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:14.203
we're more hardcore in England.

165
00:12:15.107 --> 00:12:16.876
- I'm Daisy May.

166
00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:19.846
I'm a stripper by trade.

167
00:12:19.881 --> 00:12:22.442
but I'm trying to
make a career change

168
00:12:22.477 --> 00:12:26.215
and become a successful
famous person.

169
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.120
So what happened was
I'm at my strip club.

170
00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:32.452
and I'm talking to
one of my regulars.

171
00:12:32.487 --> 00:12:37.490
And his friend comes in and
says. "Guess what. Charlie?"

172
00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:40.295
That's my regular.

173
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.397
"There is a Bigfoot out in
the woods on the loose."

174
00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:46.334
- My name is Tilly Takahashi.

175
00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:49.040
I'm half-German
and half-Japanese.

176
00:12:49.075 --> 00:12:52.043
My mother was German.
and she named me Tilly

177
00:12:52.078 --> 00:12:54.309
because I have
bravery and strength.

178
00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:58.115
And my father gave me his
sword on his deathbed.

179
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.514
So I travel with
it wherever I go.

180
00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:04.220
Even in the forest. even
when I'm on the bathroom.

181
00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:06.123
You know why?

182
00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:08.323
Because Bigfoot can sneak
up on you in the forest.

183
00:13:08.358 --> 00:13:10.897
Even when you're
popping a squat!

184
00:13:10.932 --> 00:13:15.935
- Ahoy maties. I'm Jesse
James from Bigfoot or Bust.

185
00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:20.005
And I have a plan to come
back and prove to everyone

186
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.108
that Bigfoot exists and
bring him back alive.

187
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.209
But in my care.

188
00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:29.410
I have a way of taming beasts.

189
00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.643
- Hi. I'm Rusty Ready.

190
00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.216
I'm Wally's sister.

191
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.954
Well. I used to think
we were cousins.

192
00:13:34.989 --> 00:13:37.385
but I found out he's my brother.

193
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.058
which is so strange because
also there's a rumor

194
00:13:40.093 --> 00:13:42.555
in our family that we're
related to Bigfoot.

195
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.459
And it's been my dream since I
was a little. little. little.

196
00:13:45.494 --> 00:13:50.464
little. little girl to capture
Bigfoot. and I'm gon do it.

197
00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:55.975
If I have to entice him
any way I can.

198
00:13:57.638 --> 00:14:01.310
- Hi. I'm Wally. and I am a
lean. mean killing machine.

199
00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:03.147
- Lean?

200
00:14:03.182 --> 00:14:04.643
- I even got firepower
because the number one thing

201
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:08.449
that's on my plate
right now is Bigfoot.

202
00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:10.253
He's mine.

203
00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:13.157
I'm gonna get very large
amounts of money for that thing.

204
00:14:13.192 --> 00:14:15.159
Big smelly turd.

205
00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:18.195
By the way. these are my horses.

206
00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:22.067
This is my farm.

207
00:14:22.102 --> 00:14:24.003
You go on my website
anytime you want

208
00:14:24.038 --> 00:14:28.502
because I can teach you how
to ride one of them horses.

209
00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:36.279
- Okay. ladies. are we locked
and loaded and ready to go?

210
00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:37.313
- Yes. we are.

211
00:14:37.348 --> 00:14:39.414
I got my crossbow.

212
00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:40.679
- Ready to shoot.

213
00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.351
- Woo!
- My darts.

214
00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:44.617
- Now. Daisy. I have
an instrument here.

215
00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.322
- Okay.
- I'm gonna give you this.

216
00:14:46.357 --> 00:14:49.028
This is a tranquilizer
gun. right?

217
00:14:49.063 --> 00:14:51.261
Just 'cause it's your
first time and everything.

218
00:14:51.296 --> 00:14:52.625
- What does it do?

219
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.231
- If he gets close.
you're gonna.

220
00:14:54.266 --> 00:14:55.397
you're gonna shoot him with it.

221
00:14:55.432 --> 00:14:57.003
- Okay. okay. where?

222
00:14:57.038 --> 00:14:58.598
In the butt. right. in the butt?

223
00:14:58.633 --> 00:14:59.467
- I say in the butt.
- In the butt. in the butt?

224
00:14:59.502 --> 00:15:01.106
- Oh no. no.

225
00:15:01.141 --> 00:15:02.272
We need to shoot
him in the balls.

226
00:15:02.307 --> 00:15:03.977
- In the balls?
- Ooh. nasty!

227
00:15:04.012 --> 00:15:05.704
- I mean. if he's
not cooperating.

228
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.376
- Like that!
- Yeah. exactly.

229
00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:09.983
- And so you know the
one action where you.

230
00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:11.149
- Okay.
- Yeah. there you go.

231
00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:12.216
There you go.
- Like that!

232
00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:13.448
- Right.
- And then that.

233
00:15:13.483 --> 00:15:15.384
- And also Penny will cover you.

234
00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:18.420
Hopefully you won't shoot
one of us. but if you do.

235
00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:20.356
- I have Narcan in my backpack.

236
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:21.753
- Oh. well that would help.

237
00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:23.755
- Okay. but if I shoot
him in the balls.

238
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.757
how are we gonna do
a good interview?

239
00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.429
I thought you said
there's gonna be

240
00:15:27.464 --> 00:15:29.695
like news crews from
all over the world.

241
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.039
- We'll do the selfies first.
and if he's not cooperating.

242
00:15:33.074 --> 00:15:34.436
then you shoot him in the balls.

243
00:15:34.471 --> 00:15:36.042
- I don't think this--
- We'll tell you.

244
00:15:36.077 --> 00:15:37.076
We'll tell you when
to do it. yeah.

245
00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:38.308
Right. are we ready?

246
00:15:38.343 --> 00:15:39.672
- Yeah.
- Are we ready to go?

247
00:15:39.707 --> 00:15:41.476
- Yes.
- Yeah. let's do it ladies!

248
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:42.741

- Billy. you're not gonna
believe what just happened.

260
00:16:52.186 --> 00:16:57.156
I'm driving my Jeep. and
Bigfoot just ran across the road

261
00:16:58.258 --> 00:16:59.356
right in front of my Jeep.

262
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.226
- Did you shoot him?

263
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:04.460
- I got out. I ran with my
gun. but I couldn't catch him.

264
00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:05.659
But can you believe that?

265
00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:07.760
- All right. look. be careful.

266
00:17:07.795 --> 00:17:10.136
regroup and take
care of business.

267
00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:12.534
- I'll get him. don't you worry.

268
00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.207
All right. keep you posted. bye.

269
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.148
- Is everyone all right?

270
00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:22.808
- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:17:22.843 --> 00:17:24.084
- Okay. good.

272
00:17:25.516 --> 00:17:27.120
What year is it?

273
00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:28.253
- 2022.

274
00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:29.716
- Well. at least it's not 2020.

275
00:17:31.489 --> 00:17:32.686
Where is Bigfoot?

276
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:33.819
- We're gonna find out.

277
00:17:36.593 --> 00:17:38.164
I see him.

278
00:17:38.199 --> 00:17:38.857
- Let's go that way.

279
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:39.726
- Yep.
- Yeah.

280
00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:40.393
- Let's go.

281
00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:43.301
- Where'd you last see Bigfoot?

282
00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:44.830
- Well. last time
he got really close.

283
00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:46.271
but we were watching
for the droppings.

284
00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:48.405
We were looking on the ground

285
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.605
to see if we could
see any. any...

286
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.277
- You mean the poop?

287
00:17:52.312 --> 00:17:53.575
- Wait. wait. hold
it. hold it. guys.

288
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.445
This thing is so heavy.

289
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.447
I just don't know what to
do. I can't carry it anymore.

290
00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:58.910
- Yeah. me too. this
is really heavy.

291
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.582
- Okay. come on. girls.

292
00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:03.453
Use your brain. put
it in your backpack.

293
00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:26.443
- Hey there. sweetheart.

294
00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:30.612
First I got your daddy.
and now I got his kin.

295
00:18:37.753 --> 00:18:41.326
Adios. doll.

296
00:19:02.646 --> 00:19:04.745
- Oh my God. did you
bitches just hear that?

297
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.286
- That's Bigfoot.
it's gotta be Bigfoot!

298
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:09.849
- That has to be something.
that was really big.

299
00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:11.587
- Yes. let's get him!

300
00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:13.919
- Come on. girls. let's go!
- Let's do this.

301
00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:15.591
- Oh my God. are you sure?

302
00:19:15.626 --> 00:19:17.791
Okay. I guess I really
wanna get famous.

303
00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:22.532
- What is that?

304
00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.239
- Someone's hurt!

305
00:19:26.274 --> 00:19:26.899
- Oh!

306
00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:27.900
Oh!

307
00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.902
- Oh my God. you guys.

308
00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:31.442
Is she dead?

309
00:19:31.477 --> 00:19:32.575
Is she dead?

310
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.610
- Dr. Dawn. you're a doctor.

311
00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:35.908
Is she dead?
- It's Jesse.

312
00:19:38.286 --> 00:19:39.681
- Well. no. no.
wait. wait. wait.

313
00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:40.682
You're a doctor.
you can help her.

314
00:19:40.717 --> 00:19:41.881
- You're a doctor?

315
00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:42.882
She's a doctor.
- Are you okay?

316
00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:44.521
- Yeah. she is a doctor.

317
00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:46.457
- Well. I'm not that
kind of a doctor.

318
00:19:46.492 --> 00:19:47.326
- Oh!

319
00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:48.624
She's alive.

320
00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:49.790
She's alive.
- What. are you okay?

321
00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:51.495
Are you okay?
- Oh my God.

322
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.859
- You've broken something?
- You okay?

323
00:19:52.894 --> 00:19:54.432
You need help.
- No. no. I'm good.

324
00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:55.433
I'm good.

325
00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:56.863
- You guys. she's alive.

326
00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:58.733
- Jesse. what are
you doing here?

327
00:19:58.768 --> 00:20:00.306
- Holy cow.

328
00:20:00.341 --> 00:20:04.409
Some freaking. whatever
the hell that was.

329
00:20:04.444 --> 00:20:05.311
- Bigfoot!

330
00:20:08.877 --> 00:20:10.547
- Are you guys looking
for Bigfoot too?

331
00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:11.977
- Yes.
- Yeah.

332
00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:13.385
- Oh my God.
- Are you looking for Bigfoot?

333
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.584
- Yes.

334
00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:15.717
Yes.
- Did you find him?

335
00:20:15.752 --> 00:20:17.785
- He snuck up on me.

336
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.457
- Bigfoot threw
you off the bridge?

337
00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:20.887
- Was he stinky?
- I think so.

338
00:20:20.922 --> 00:20:22.625
- Oh my God. you're
so lucky to be alive.

339
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.923
- I know.

340
00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.595
- I know.
- You were so close.

341
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.432
Did you feel him.
did you smell him?

342
00:20:27.467 --> 00:20:29.302
- I. I. I could...

343
00:20:29.337 --> 00:20:31.370
I could sense that he was
there or something was there.

344
00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:32.800
And then I just saw his.

345
00:20:32.835 --> 00:20:35.869
- I'm amazed. there's
not even any blood.

346
00:20:35.904 --> 00:20:37.508
- Here. help her
up. help her up.

347
00:20:37.543 --> 00:20:38.003
- We were right. okay.
- Can you stand up?

348
00:20:40.348 --> 00:20:41.776
- Oh. I'm fine.

349
00:20:41.811 --> 00:20:44.482
I'm good. I'm good.
- You wanna join us?

350
00:20:44.517 --> 00:20:46.616
- I mean. really?

351
00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:48.486
- Yeah. that'd be great.
- Yeah.

352
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:50.521
- I think that
would be fricking awesome.

353
00:20:50.556 --> 00:20:52.754
- Woo!
- Yay. honey!

354
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:54.624
- There's not a scratch on you.

355
00:20:54.659 --> 00:20:55.757
- All right. guys.

356
00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:57.088
- Let's go.
- Come on. yeah.

357
00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:58.958
- This a-way.
- Okay.

358
00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:01.026
- And stay clear of that
bridge. for the love of God.

359
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:03.699
- There's not a
scratch on you. bitch.

360
00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:06.372
And you still look good.

361
00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:16.349
- He's gotta be out
there somewhere.

362
00:21:16.384 --> 00:21:19.484
- You know. I think it's
time for Bigfoot calling.

363
00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:22.080
- Yeah. Tarzan style.

364
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:22.949
- Oh.

365
00:21:27.021 --> 00:21:28.086
- Is it working?

366
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.561
- Bigfoot!

367
00:21:30.596 --> 00:21:32.431
- Let's try Jane style.

368
00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:33.432
- What's Jane style?

369
00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:34.433
- Like.

370
00:21:35.062 --> 00:21:36.028
- Oh.

371
00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:38.030
- Like a girlie one.

372
00:21:40.804 --> 00:21:41.869
Is he coming?

373
00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:43.002
No.

374
00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:45.004
Let's try ape style. like.

375
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.610
- Oh. okay.

376
00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:51.549
- Yeah. put with it.

377
00:21:53.883 --> 00:21:55.080
Like put it in.

378
00:21:58.426 --> 00:22:00.789
- Maybe we need to
try something else.

379
00:22:00.824 --> 00:22:01.757
- Try this one.

380
00:22:04.927 --> 00:22:06.157
- Okay.

381
00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:09.864
- No. no. you need to be
louder than that. Penny.

382
00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:10.997
Like this.

383
00:22:12.572 --> 00:22:13.868
- Okay. let me try.

384
00:22:16.444 --> 00:22:17.938
- No. no. like this one.

385
00:22:19.777 --> 00:22:20.644
- Okay.

386
00:22:27.048 --> 00:22:28.784
- Okay. that has gotta do it.

387
00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:30.588
- That has to do it.

388
00:22:30.623 --> 00:22:31.589
Do you see him yet?

389
00:22:32.592 --> 00:22:33.624
- No.

390
00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:37.826
We need some like
real sound system.

391
00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:41.060
- Yeah. maybe we can try and
find a real sound system.

392
00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:42.094
and that would work.
- Yeah.

393
00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:43.766
- I bet that would work.

394
00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:44.866
- There's gotta be one
round here somewhere.

395
00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:45.768
- Yeah.

396
00:22:47.673 --> 00:22:48.936
- Do you think he's close?

397
00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:50.641
- I think I smell him.

398
00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:51.543
- Yeah.

399
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:55.481
We are real close.
I smell him too.

400
00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:56.878
All right. team.

401
00:22:56.913 --> 00:22:58.682
We need to remember
why we are here.

402
00:22:58.717 --> 00:22:59.683
- But why are we here?

403
00:22:59.718 --> 00:23:00.849
- Yeah. why are we here?

404
00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:04.787
- To get Bigfoot's droppings.

405
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.527
- You mean we're here
looking for shit?

406
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:10.958
- Yeah.

407
00:23:10.993 --> 00:23:13.994
No. I mean. for
medicinal purposes.

408
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:16.601
we need his droppings.

409
00:23:16.636 --> 00:23:18.229
Team.

410
00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:22.772
In 2050. Bigfoot droppings
are worth trillions

411
00:23:22.807 --> 00:23:24.675
and trillions.
- Wow.

412
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.548
- All we need is just two or
three of those big babies.

413
00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:31.242
and we'll be trillionaires.

414
00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:35.147
- That is great. oh my God!

415
00:23:35.182 --> 00:23:36.918
- Get it together. let's go.

416
00:23:37.855 --> 00:23:39.525
- Droppings. shit.

417
00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:44.024
- This is gonna be the third
time that I've done this.

418
00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:46.191
The call me Dr. Dawn
because I'm a doctor.

419
00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:50.536
I have a PhD from Oxford
in chemical engineering.

420
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:54.100
Actually it was a little.
little college down the road

421
00:23:54.135 --> 00:23:55.772
from the regular Oxford.

422
00:23:55.807 --> 00:23:58.137
And it's actually in
paranormal science.

423
00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:00.546
But you know. I don't
tell the girls that.

424
00:24:00.581 --> 00:24:03.043
I'm a little on the edge.
and I'm not sure that.

425
00:24:03.078 --> 00:24:05.650
you know. they all
really appreciate that.

426
00:24:05.685 --> 00:24:08.081
- I had an Elvis sighting.

427
00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:09.720
and he asked me
if he can help me.

428
00:24:09.755 --> 00:24:12.283
And I go. "Yeah. sure.

429
00:24:12.318 --> 00:24:13.922
"But you're not really
Elvis. are you?"

430
00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:15.792
He goes. "No. I'm Elvis.

431
00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:17.860
"No one can see me. but
you because you're special.

432
00:24:17.895 --> 00:24:20.060
"And I'm making an appearance."

433
00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:22.260
I said. "Can I get a selfie?"

434
00:24:22.295 --> 00:24:25.131
So I took a selfie. and
I turned around to finish

435
00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:28.299
putting the gas on. he just
disappeared into thin air.

436
00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:31.170
- And this particular Bigfoot is

437
00:24:31.205 --> 00:24:35.515
really attracted to white
girls with big booties.

438
00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:38.144
Like mine.

439
00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:40.311
- You might wonder why I
joined this expedition.

440
00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:42.852
Well. I felt like the
girls could use my help

441
00:24:42.887 --> 00:24:45.151
because I have sword skills!

442
00:24:45.186 --> 00:24:47.758
I think I'm very strong.

443
00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:50.123
And I don't think Bigfoot
is gonna stand a chance

444
00:24:50.158 --> 00:24:53.060
against me. even though
I'm much smaller than him.

445
00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:55.964
It doesn't matter.
I've got brains too.

446
00:24:55.999 --> 00:24:57.801
And he's just a big oaf.

447
00:24:57.836 --> 00:25:00.166
What is he doing wandering
around the forest all the time?

448
00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:06.337
- Wait. wait. whoa. whoa. whoa.

449
00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:07.580
Look. look. look.

450
00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:09.747
- Is that an animal?

451
00:25:09.782 --> 00:25:11.243
- It's a clue. it looks...

452
00:25:11.278 --> 00:25:13.080
- Oh my God.
- Oh no. it looks like.

453
00:25:13.115 --> 00:25:16.721
- It stinks.
- What is that stench?

454
00:25:16.756 --> 00:25:18.085
Ew!

455
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.658
Ew. ew. ew.
- It smells.

456
00:25:19.693 --> 00:25:21.187
- Ew. ew. ew.

457
00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:23.354
- Does it smell like him?
- What is it?

458
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:25.224
- Oh.
- I don't wanna smell it.

459
00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:27.963
I can smell it from here.
don't get closer. no!

460
00:25:27.998 --> 00:25:29.195
- You can see the skin
underneath if you look.

461
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.801
- Oh no. it's fresh.

462
00:25:30.836 --> 00:25:32.264
- It came from his butt?

463
00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:34.607
- Well. this looks like
where the legs would be.

464
00:25:34.642 --> 00:25:36.708
- Maybe he's hurt.
- Yeah. maybe he's hurt.

465
00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:38.138
Maybe somebody cut him.

466
00:25:38.173 --> 00:25:39.337
- Well. he hurt
me. good for him.

467
00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:40.910
- So wait a second.

468
00:25:40.945 --> 00:25:42.879
Does this mean
we're one more step

469
00:25:42.914 --> 00:25:45.244
closer to finding Bigfoot?

470
00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:47.279
So we're one step closer
to getting famous?

471
00:25:47.314 --> 00:25:49.215
- No. I think what
happened was he--

472
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.755
- Oh my God. I'm so excited.

473
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.218
- He's gotta be close.

474
00:25:52.253 --> 00:25:54.088
- Okay. let's go find him.
- Yeah.

475
00:25:54.123 --> 00:25:56.156
- Okay. find him.
- This is my moment.

476
00:25:56.191 --> 00:25:57.322
I'm getting famous.

477
00:25:58.391 --> 00:25:59.225
I'm brave.

478
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.127
Here we go!

479
00:26:02.967 --> 00:26:04.131
- Oh my God.

480
00:26:13.912 --> 00:26:14.779
Oh my God.

481
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.312
Guys. unless that's a
mirage. that is a trampoline!

482
00:26:20.347 --> 00:26:22.116
- A what?
- Trampoline.

483
00:26:22.151 --> 00:26:24.118
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

484
00:26:24.153 --> 00:26:26.758
- Just like that?
- Let's go check it out!

485
00:26:29.158 --> 00:26:31.224
- Let's go jump on it!

486
00:26:32.733 --> 00:26:34.700
Trampoline!
- God. freaking awesome.

487
00:26:34.735 --> 00:26:37.263
- Oh my God. I love trampolines.

488
00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:39.903
Oh. I am so excited!

489
00:26:41.302 --> 00:26:44.039
I love trampolines.
- Who's gonna go first?

490
00:26:44.074 --> 00:26:46.008
- Me. me. me. me. me.
me. me. I'm always last.

491
00:26:46.043 --> 00:26:47.141
I'm going first.

492
00:26:47.176 --> 00:26:48.747
No. I'm always fucking last.

493
00:26:48.782 --> 00:26:49.880
I'm going first.
bitches. I go first.

494
00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:51.684
- Wait.

495
00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:53.114
Did you know there's
actually scientific evidence

496
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:56.722
that squeaky springs are
gonna excite Bigfoot?

497
00:26:56.757 --> 00:26:58.416
- Really?
- Wow.

498
00:26:58.451 --> 00:27:01.320
- So if we jump really high.
we could get him all excited.

499
00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:02.992
and he could come down to us.

500
00:27:03.027 --> 00:27:06.930
- I'm really good at
making beds squeak.

501
00:27:06.965 --> 00:27:08.932
So let me see what I can do.

502
00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:10.835
- Okay.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

503
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.134
Just. just. guys. be careful
though. because you know.

504
00:27:13.169 --> 00:27:16.269
if he does appear. you
got. you got. you know.

505
00:27:16.304 --> 00:27:17.402
- Are we ready?
- We're ready.

506
00:27:17.437 --> 00:27:19.437

649

- I am worried.

650
00:35:17.389 --> 00:35:19.290
I'm a doctor. it's
my job to be worried.

651
00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:22.425
- I thought you were some
sort of paranormal doctor?

652
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.329
- I am. but I'm also a doctor
of internal medicine as well.

653
00:35:25.364 --> 00:35:27.727
- Oh. that's quite impressive.

654
00:35:27.762 --> 00:35:29.795
- Let's take off your
shirt. let me examine you.

655
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.698
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. wait
a minute. I just met you.

656
00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:33.601
You're not gonna at least
buy me a drink or something?

657
00:35:33.636 --> 00:35:36.208
- So silly. let
me just take your shirt.

658
00:35:36.936 --> 00:35:37.836
- Oh. man.

659
00:35:42.282 --> 00:35:44.645
- Okay. I need to look at
your neck and your spine.

660
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.185
I'm a bit concerned.

661
00:35:49.982 --> 00:35:51.982
Does it hurt right there?
- Ow. yes!

662
00:35:52.017 --> 00:35:54.457
- I'm sorry. that's a hematoma.

663
00:35:54.492 --> 00:35:56.459
- What the hell is that?

664
00:35:56.494 --> 00:35:58.230
- Well. that's not another that

665
00:35:58.265 --> 00:35:59.693
that's where blood is collected

666
00:35:59.728 --> 00:36:02.234
under the skin where
the injury was.

667
00:36:02.269 --> 00:36:03.631
Are you feeling dizzy?

668
00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:05.699
- Yeah. a little. yeah.

669
00:36:05.734 --> 00:36:08.636
- Yeah. I'm a little concerned
you've got a concussion.

670
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:10.407
Just don't go to sleep.

671
00:36:10.442 --> 00:36:12.805
Don't take a nap for
at least six hours.

672
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.807
- Why is that?

673
00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:16.875
- Because you might not wake up.

674
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.387
- Did you hear that?

675
00:36:23.422 --> 00:36:24.388
- What?

676
00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:26.291
- Nothing.

677
00:36:26.326 --> 00:36:28.425
- Put your shirt on. we should
go catch up with the girls.

678
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.558
- Okay.

679
00:36:29.593 --> 00:36:32.264
You go ahead. and I'll catch up.

680
00:36:56.389 --> 00:36:57.982
- He's gotta be close.

681
00:36:58.017 --> 00:37:01.425
I mean. those sounds are
getting louder and the tracks.

682
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.295
You know. you're lucky
when he came up behind you

683
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.792
on the bridge that
he didn't hurt you.

684
00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:06.694
Jesse?

685
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:08.696
Jesse?

686
00:37:11.063 --> 00:37:12.337
Jesse. where'd you go?

687
00:37:15.441 --> 00:37:16.308
Jesse?

688
00:37:19.577 --> 00:37:21.445
- It's so hot.

689
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.348
I don't think we
went the right way.

690
00:37:23.383 --> 00:37:24.811
- No.
- I don't know.

691
00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:26.582
I wish there was some
way we could cool off.

692
00:37:26.617 --> 00:37:27.979
- I put my hair up.

693
00:37:28.014 --> 00:37:29.321
It's not helping.
- It's getting hotter.

694
00:37:29.356 --> 00:37:31.048
- Yeah. I don't know what to do.

695
00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:32.720
- Well. I'm a stripper. so
I'm gonna start stripping.

like a good idea.

00:37:35.626 --> 00:37:37.021
- Hey. I don't know.
- You know what?

698
00:37:37.056 --> 00:37:38.429
- It's not a party
until we all do it.

699
00:37:40.026 --> 00:37:40.992

bottles in our backpacks.

- Hi. I'm Director Jim Wynorski.

721
00:38:45.157 --> 00:38:47.762
and I'm stopping
this film right now.

722
00:38:47.797 --> 00:38:49.830
There's just too
much gratuitous sex.

723
00:40:37.709 --> 00:40:38.576
- Jesse?

724
00:40:40.173 --> 00:40:41.040
Jesse!

725
00:40:42.142 --> 00:40:43.108
- Freeze!

726
00:40:43.143 --> 00:40:44.747
- Who are you?

727
00:40:44.782 --> 00:40:46.177
- Who the hell are you?

728
00:40:46.212 --> 00:40:49.213
- I'm Dr. Dawn from
the Dr. Dawn Show!

729
00:40:49.248 --> 00:40:50.247
- Dr. Dawn.

730
00:40:50.282 --> 00:40:51.886
- Who's that?

731
00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:54.284
- The Dr. Dawn Show was
canceled 20 years ago.

732
00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:56.561
- Well. who are you.
where are you from?

733
00:40:56.596 --> 00:41:00.125
- We're from 2050. and
we're here hunting Bigfoot.

734
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.798
- We were here first.
we're hunting Bigfoot.

735
00:41:02.833 --> 00:41:04.668
- We're the ones that
are gonna hunt Bigfoot

736
00:41:04.703 --> 00:41:06.131
because we need his crap.

737
00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:07.539
- Oh no. you're not.

738
00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:09.706
- Yeah. and it's
worth trillions.

739
00:41:09.741 --> 00:41:12.005
- You're telling me that
you are collecting his poop?

740
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.237
- We're getting his poop.

741
00:41:13.272 --> 00:41:16.009
- Bigfoot is passing gold bars?

742
00:41:16.044 --> 00:41:18.880
- Practically. and
we're gonna be rich!

743
00:41:18.915 --> 00:41:20.310
- Yes!
- That's right.

744
00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:22.653
- I'm a scientist.
this is fascinating.

745
00:41:22.688 --> 00:41:23.819
What are you gonna do with it?

746
00:41:23.854 --> 00:41:25.150
- Doesn't matter what you think

747
00:41:25.185 --> 00:41:27.856
because we have the big guns.

748
00:41:27.891 --> 00:41:30.925
- Oh yeah. well
look at these guns.

749
00:41:32.929 --> 00:41:33.994
- She's got pretty big guns.

750
00:41:34.029 --> 00:41:35.325
- Wow.
- Yeah.

751
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.602
- Those are...

752
00:41:37.637 --> 00:41:38.603
big guns.

753
00:41:38.638 --> 00:41:39.967
Well. what about yours?

754
00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:43.740
- We got big guns too.
- Mm-hmm.

755
00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:48.338
- So you are out.

756
00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:51.143
- You're not gonna hurt him
with those guns. are you?

757
00:41:51.178 --> 00:41:54.278
- No. we're just gonna
scare the poop out of him.

758
00:41:56.315 --> 00:41:57.886
- What do you do in the future?

759
00:41:57.921 --> 00:41:59.690
What is this poop gonna be for?

760
00:42:01.628 --> 00:42:02.891
I need to know about this. I
need to know about everything.

761
00:42:02.926 --> 00:42:04.321
- All right. enough of this.

762
00:42:04.356 --> 00:42:05.322
- Well. tell me
about the future.

763
00:42:05.357 --> 00:42:06.323
What is it about?

764
00:42:06.358 --> 00:42:07.797
- I'm gonna zap her.

765
00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:12.230
All right. that's
good. let's go.

766
00:42:12.265 --> 00:42:13.198
- Okay.

767
00:42:13.233 --> 00:42:14.100
- Jesse?

768
00:42:15.873 --> 00:42:16.740
Jesse!

769
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:18.610
Jesse?

770
00:42:25.212 --> 00:42:26.816
- Whoo!
- Whoo hoo!

771
00:42:28.116 --> 00:42:29.984
- Hey. let's try
some Bigfoot calling!

772
00:42:30.019 --> 00:42:31.722
- Oh yeah. let's do that.

773
00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:32.888
- Let's try it.

774
00:42:35.123 --> 00:42:36.727
- Bigfoot!

775
00:42:38.357 --> 00:42:39.994
Whoo!
- Whoo!

776
00:42:40.029 --> 00:42:41.963
Come out. come out. Bigfoot!

777
00:42:41.998 --> 00:42:43.393
Okay. that one again.
that one again.

778
00:42:49.236 --> 00:42:51.137
Okay. let's try that one.
see what that one does.

779
00:42:58.377 --> 00:42:59.684
That should do it.

780
00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:01.114
Come out. come out. Bigfoot.

781
00:43:01.149 --> 00:43:02.247
- Yeah. where's
Bigfoot. come on.

782
00:43:02.282 --> 00:43:03.886
- Okay. try the first one again.

783
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:05.316
Try that one. that
was a good one.

784
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.701
Whoo!

785
00:43:16.736 --> 00:43:18.065
That was very loud!

786
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.397
Let's put the volume up. whoo!

787
00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.207
Whoo!

788
00:43:41.057 --> 00:43:43.860
Guys. guys!
- What happened?

789
00:43:43.895 --> 00:43:44.993
- Where's Jesse?

790
00:43:45.028 --> 00:43:47.028
- I don't know. Jesse's gone.

791
00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:48.898
- What happened?
- I don't know.

792
00:43:48.933 --> 00:43:51.703
I mean. I look around and
she's just not there anymore.

793
00:43:51.738 --> 00:43:52.396
Don't know where she went.

794
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:53.738
- Oh my God.

795
00:43:53.773 --> 00:43:55.036
- Did Bigfoot come back for her?

796
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:57.236
- He came back for her!
- Oh my God.

797
00:43:57.271 --> 00:43:58.875
- I think so. I don't know.

798
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.745
I don't know anything!

799
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.175
- Where did it happen?
- You didn't see anything?

800
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.342
- Look. we've got two
hours of daylight left.

801
00:44:04.377 --> 00:44:05.915
We gotta find her.

802
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:06.784
- We gotta hurry. come on.

803
00:44:06.819 --> 00:44:07.917
- Oh my God.

804
00:44:07.952 --> 00:44:09.215

There's no power.

822
00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:11.343
We're lucky to have these
itty bitty flashlights.

823
00:45:11.378 --> 00:45:13.015
- I don't wanna give up.

824
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.919
- So what if she's out
there dead and bloody.

825
00:45:15.954 --> 00:45:18.515
Shouldn't we call Dateline?

826

- No!
- No. we can't tell Dateline.

827
00:45:20.519 --> 00:45:21.925
- Like. they'd be interested.

828
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.157
This would be a scoop.

829
00:45:23.192 --> 00:45:24.521
- You would never be famous.

830
00:45:24.556 --> 00:45:26.160
- Dateline isn't
gonna make me famous?

831
00:45:26.195 --> 00:45:27.359
- No. we're gonna
get in big trouble.

832
00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:28.558
You can't call the TV.

833
00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:30.329
- They're gonna send a crew out.

834
00:45:30.364 --> 00:45:31.528
They're gonna find her.

835
00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:32.903
And you'll never
get to be famous

836
00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:34.102
'cause we didn't find her!

837
00:45:36.975 --> 00:45:38.843
- What was that?

838
00:45:38.878 --> 00:45:40.339
- Jesse!

839
00:45:40.374 --> 00:45:41.846
- Jesse!

840
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.080
- Oh my God.

841
00:45:45.115 --> 00:45:46.345
- She's alive.

842
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.248
- What happened?

843
00:45:48.283 --> 00:45:50.085
- Oh my God. when I left
you. I went down the hill.

844
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.515
- We were so worried.

845
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.088
- I was walking
around for a bit.

846
00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:56.861
and I like saw Bigfoot
in the distance.

847
00:45:56.896 --> 00:45:58.522
- Again?

848
00:45:58.557 --> 00:46:01.558
- Just all of a sudden
it made a beeline for me.

849
00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:03.164
And I was like
kinda behind rocks.

850
00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:04.935
And he started chasing me.

851
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.365
And then he came close to me.

852
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.465
and he was trying
to pull my bra off.

853
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.466
- Oh my God.

854
00:46:13.913 --> 00:46:15.143
Wait. that's nothing.

855
00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:16.606
He actually physically...

856
00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:20.478
Tried to take my bra off.

857
00:46:20.513 --> 00:46:23.415
- He's a pervert.
first and foremost.

858
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.054
Just saying.

859
00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:26.924
- Guys. listen. he's
not just after me.

860
00:46:26.959 --> 00:46:28.255
He's about a block away.

861
00:46:30.226 --> 00:46:31.929
He's on my tail.

862
00:46:31.964 --> 00:46:33.326
- He's coming. he's
coming to the house?

863
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:35.559
- Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait.

864
00:46:35.594 --> 00:46:38.001
Aren't we trying to
find this mother fucker?

865
00:46:38.036 --> 00:46:40.168
- Okay. but you can't fight
him off with flashlights.

866
00:46:40.203 --> 00:46:41.598
You guys need to be armed.

867
00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:44.942
- Oh my God. weapons.

00:46:44.977 --> 00:46:46.405

874
00:46:58.155 --> 00:47:00.320

875
00:47:00.355 --> 00:47:02.124
- Do you think Bigfoot got her?

876
00:47:02.159 --> 00:47:04.863
- Nah. she's just in
the room changing.

877
00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:07.591

878
00:47:07.626 --> 00:47:08.933
- What do we do?

879
00:47:08.968 --> 00:47:10.396

way to de-stress?

881

- Oh. it's absolutely beautiful.

924
00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:07.831
- We should look
for tracks first.

925
00:51:08.867 --> 00:51:09.734
- Yeah.

926
00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:12.440
- You girls got your weapons?

927
00:51:12.475 --> 00:51:14.244
- Yep. locked and loaded.

928
00:51:14.279 --> 00:51:16.642
Hey. isn't someone missing?

929
00:51:16.677 --> 00:51:19.216
- Oh yeah. the brunettes.

930
00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:21.680
- Jesse. Tilly.
while we're young!

931
00:51:22.551 --> 00:51:24.287
- She's gone!

932
00:51:24.322 --> 00:51:26.652
Jesse's disappeared again.

933
00:51:26.687 --> 00:51:27.785
- What do you mean?

934
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.622
- I looked for her everywhere.

935
00:51:29.657 --> 00:51:33.263
In the bathrooms. the
bedrooms. the garage. poof!

936
00:51:33.298 --> 00:51:34.693
- What?
- Yeah.

937
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:41.238
- Something stinks in Denmark.

938
00:51:41.273 --> 00:51:42.932
And I'll tell you why.

939
00:51:42.967 --> 00:51:45.341
Do you guys remember yesterday

940
00:51:45.376 --> 00:51:50.379
she "supposedly" fell off
a bridge onto a big rock?

941
00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:53.943
Bitch didn't have
a scratch on her.

942
00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:58.552
And then she showed up
at the house last night.

943
00:51:58.587 --> 00:52:00.389
face on point.

944
00:52:00.424 --> 00:52:01.522
- That was weird.

945
00:52:02.888 --> 00:52:04.558
- Hair did.

946
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.264
- What are you saying?

947
00:52:07.299 --> 00:52:09.299
Are you saying that...

948
00:52:09.334 --> 00:52:10.729
That she made this up?

949
00:52:10.764 --> 00:52:12.665
That Bigfoot really
didn't attack her?

950
00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.371
- Yeah. I mean. you know
what. with all that fur.

951
00:52:15.406 --> 00:52:16.966
that's probably the
fur that we found.

952
00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:19.375
She went back and got
it when she disappeared.

953
00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:20.805
- And that thing
about the bra strap.

954
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.510
I mean. that was weird.

955
00:52:22.545 --> 00:52:24.380
I didn't believe that.
- She's crazy.

956
00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:28.879
- And last night she said the
fool was like a block away

957
00:52:29.882 --> 00:52:31.915
and coming right for us.

958
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.357
Dude never showed up.

959
00:52:34.392 --> 00:52:37.558
- And we were dancing
all sexy and everything.

960
00:52:37.593 --> 00:52:39.329
I mean. if he was out there.

961
00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:41.562
he would've for sure
come and got us.

962
00:52:42.928 --> 00:52:44.829
- Let's go look for
him. her and Bigfoot.

963
00:52:44.864 --> 00:52:46.435
- Yeah. let's track 'em both.

964
00:52:47.438 --> 00:52:48.569
- Can we call Dateline?

965
00:52:50.441 --> 00:52:53.244
- So I have been practicing
at home. which my boyfriend.

966
00:52:53.279 --> 00:52:55.411
Roger. didn't really like it
'cause I was doing that...

967
00:52:56.744 --> 00:52:58.216
You know. getting my Catgirl on.

968
00:52:59.285 --> 00:53:01.450
And doing my paw licking stuff.

969
00:53:03.454 --> 00:53:05.718
- And people think
I'm hallucinating.

970
00:53:05.753 --> 00:53:07.489
but I know it was the real Elvis

971
00:53:07.524 --> 00:53:10.294
'cause he told me
and he assured me.

972
00:53:10.329 --> 00:53:13.396
- So I said. ding. ding.
ding. ding. ding. ding.

973
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:15.332
ding. ding. ding. ding. ding.

974
00:53:16.962 --> 00:53:18.566
I've been trying to get out
of the stripping business

975
00:53:18.601 --> 00:53:21.866
for a minute now. trying
to find a new career.

976
00:53:21.901 --> 00:53:24.440
And I really wanna get famous.

977
00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:27.377
- I don't do dog stuff
'cause I'm a cat. right?

978
00:53:27.412 --> 00:53:30.644
So we're all gonna be getting
our spirit guide animal.

979
00:53:30.679 --> 00:53:32.547
getting the animalistic thing.

980
00:53:32.582 --> 00:53:37.013
And that's really gonna bring
out the feminine pheromones

981
00:53:37.048 --> 00:53:39.884
in all of us. but
our animalistic kind.

982
00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:42.788
- My sponsorship has
been going down a little.

983
00:53:42.823 --> 00:53:45.494
So what I did...

984
00:53:45.529 --> 00:53:48.992
- I decided to get into the...

985
00:53:49.027 --> 00:53:51.665
- Was I said. I'm
gonna go find Bigfoot.

986
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.602
- Looking for Bigfoot business.

987
00:53:54.637 --> 00:53:56.769
- I'm gonna get a
selfie with Bigfoot.

988
00:53:56.804 --> 00:53:58.408
- So I'm very excited.

989
00:53:58.443 --> 00:54:01.444
You know. we got a
bunch of girls here.

990
00:54:01.479 --> 00:54:03.941
We're all gonna be
getting our furry on.

991
00:54:03.976 --> 00:54:07.714
- And hopefully there is a
Bigfoot out there somewhere.

992
00:54:07.749 --> 00:54:09.584
and if there is...

993
00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:12.081
- And we're gonna find him.
and we're gonna get him.

994
00:54:12.116 --> 00:54:15.458
We're gonna empower him
with our femininity.

995
00:54:15.493 --> 00:54:17.020
- I'm gonna find him.

996
00:54:17.055 --> 00:54:19.627
- We're gonna interact with him.

997
00:54:19.662 --> 00:54:22.729
We're gonna find out about
his thoughts and his feelings

998
00:54:22.764 --> 00:54:24.764
and his inner self.
and why he's been

999
00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:26.832
hiding out all these years.

1000
00:54:26.867 --> 00:54:28.636
- I would bet on me.

1001
00:54:28.671 --> 00:54:30.737
If you're a betting
person. Vegas odds have it.

1002
00:54:30.772 --> 00:54:32.838
that we're 50 to one.
whatever that means.

1003
00:54:32.873 --> 00:54:34.477
I'm not a betting person.

1004
00:54:34.512 --> 00:54:38.415
- So I met some other
girls along the way.

1005
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.615
and they are out to
do the same thing.

1006
00:54:41.585 --> 00:54:43.519
Five girls together?

1007
00:54:43.554 --> 00:54:46.489
Now come on guys.
you can't beat that.

1008
00:54:47.591 --> 00:54:49.327

1037
00:57:13.297 --> 00:57:15.132
- Wait. I'm getting a signal.

1038
00:57:15.167 --> 00:57:19.543
It's detecting
something right here.

1039
00:57:19.578 --> 00:57:20.874
- Do you see anything?

1040
00:57:20.909 --> 00:57:22.007
- What is it?

1041
00:57:22.042 --> 00:57:24.548
- Someone fell here recently.

1042
00:57:24.583 --> 00:57:26.011
- Who?

1043
00:57:26.046 --> 00:57:27.782
- Wait a minute. wait a
minute. I'm getting it.

1044
00:57:30.919 --> 00:57:33.986
There's some hot chicks.

1045
00:57:34.956 --> 00:57:36.054
- What?
- Wait.

1046
00:57:36.089 --> 00:57:37.187
Are they hotter than. than us?

1047
00:57:37.222 --> 00:57:38.661
- No.
- No way.

1048
00:57:38.696 --> 00:57:40.058
- No.

1049
00:57:40.093 --> 00:57:43.963
But it means that
there's a lot of them.

1050
00:57:43.998 --> 00:57:45.767
- No way.

1051
00:57:45.802 --> 00:57:47.835
- And they're also
hunting Bigfoot.

1052
00:57:49.806 --> 00:57:53.137
It just means that we're
gonna have to be hotter.

1053
00:57:54.305 --> 00:57:57.680
faster. sexier and...

1054
00:57:57.715 --> 00:57:58.879
- Bustier!

1055
00:57:58.914 --> 00:58:01.178
- Yes.
- Bustier. that's it.

1056
00:58:01.213 --> 00:58:02.850
Now I know what we're
gonna have to do.

1057
00:58:02.885 --> 00:58:06.216
We're gonna have to use
this press-ta-digitizer.

1058
00:58:06.251 --> 00:58:08.251
and we're gonna need to
transport out of here

1059
00:58:08.286 --> 00:58:09.923
to a better location.

1060
00:58:09.958 --> 00:58:11.056
We can do this.
- Yes.

1061
00:58:11.091 --> 00:58:12.255
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

1062
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:13.795
- All right and...

1063
00:58:28.944 --> 00:58:32.682
- Bubba. you are getting
rid of that ugly TV

1064
00:58:33.751 --> 00:58:35.278
if it is the last thing you do.

1065
00:58:35.313 --> 00:58:38.215
I don't care if it's
got a built in VHS.

1066
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.052
- It's battery operated!

1067
00:58:40.087 --> 00:58:42.692
- You stole it from
the thrift store.

1068
00:58:42.727 --> 00:58:44.859
And how much do you think
you're gonna get for it now?

1069
00:58:44.894 --> 00:58:46.058
- Oh. come on. sis.

1070
00:58:46.093 --> 00:58:47.697
You got it so easy.

1071
00:58:47.732 --> 00:58:49.798
I'm trying to pay for
college here. all right?

1072
00:58:49.833 --> 00:58:51.899
- Oh. pfft. I take
care of your ass.

1073
00:58:51.934 --> 00:58:54.935
Here. it's $2. take it.

1074
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.574
What I owe you. 10 more?

1075
00:58:58.336 --> 00:59:02.008
Now. Bubba. you cannot
get caught stealing
again. all right?

1076
00:59:02.043 --> 00:59:03.845
You're not gonna be
able to go to college

1077
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.848
because you're gonna
go to the pokey!

1078
00:59:06.883 --> 00:59:09.081
You remember that time
that you got caught

1079
00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:11.787
flashing those nuns in public?

1080
00:59:14.187 --> 00:59:15.725
- Yeah.

1081
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.629
- Well. you stole those
prescription drugs

1082
00:59:18.664 --> 00:59:20.257
from that store after hours?

1083
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:22.160
- Oh my God.

1084
00:59:22.195 --> 00:59:23.799
Yeah. I remember that.

1085
00:59:23.834 --> 00:59:25.064
- Bubba. you're old
enough now you are

1086
00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:26.934
gonna go to the big house.

1087
00:59:26.969 --> 00:59:29.200
- What. really?

1088
00:59:29.235 --> 00:59:31.070
- I'm gonna go on down
just right past this crick.

1089
00:59:31.105 --> 00:59:32.643
and you're gonna get
this thing outta here.

1090
00:59:32.678 --> 00:59:33.875
Do you understand?

1091
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:38.847
Now git!

1092
00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:50.419
Go. go. go!

1093
00:59:50.454 --> 00:59:52.927
- It's battery-operated.
come on.

1094
00:59:56.427 --> 00:59:57.668
- Attaboy.

1095
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.907
Get in.

1096
01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.978
- All right. let's go.

1097
01:00:11.013 --> 01:00:12.111
- I'm proud of you. Bubba.

1098
01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:13.376
Let's go get some ice cream.

1099
01:00:40.207 --> 01:00:42.779
- Hello. I'm Screens.

1100
01:00:42.814 --> 01:00:46.948
I work as a monitoring system
for Robo Sports Action Now.

1101
01:00:46.983 --> 01:00:49.247
- Oh. I can't believe I'm
actually afraid of a penis.

1102
01:00:49.282 --> 01:00:50.380
Who would've thought?

1103
01:00:50.415 --> 01:00:51.381
- A blue one at that.

1104
01:00:51.416 --> 01:00:52.151
- I don't wanna die!

1105
01:01:23.019 --> 01:01:24.381
- No. no!

1106
01:01:27.419 --> 01:01:30.827
- It's the
Dr. Dawn Show in 3D.

1107
01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:34.490
With your host. Dr. Dawn.

1108
01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.866
Tonight's special
guest. Penny Blossom.

1109
01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:41.200
And tonight's topic is none
other than Bigfoot as usual.

1110
01:01:41.235 --> 01:01:43.466
Hello. Dr. Gail.

1111
01:01:43.501 --> 01:01:47.910
- Hi. I'm Dr. Dawn.
doctor of parapsychology.

1112
01:01:47.945 --> 01:01:50.880
doctor of internal medicine
and sometimes surgery.

1113
01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:54.917
And I'm here with my very
special guest. Penny Blossom.

1114
01:01:54.952 --> 01:01:56.853
- Hi!

1115
01:01:56.888 --> 01:01:58.855
- And tonight we're gonna
be talking about Bigfoot.

1116
01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:00.285
- Yay.

1117
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.419
- So Penny. you think
you actually so Bigfoot?

1118
01:02:02.454 --> 01:02:04.828
- Oh. I know I saw him.

1119
01:02:04.863 --> 01:02:08.260
My friends doubted me. but
I was up near Sacramento.

1120
01:02:08.295 --> 01:02:10.262
I was panning for
gold 'cause you know.

1121
01:02:10.297 --> 01:02:12.099
I'm a golddigger.

1122
01:02:12.134 --> 01:02:14.970
And there he was in the
distance. and my friend said.

1123
01:02:15.005 --> 01:02:16.400
"No. that's not Bigfoot."

1124
01:02:16.435 --> 01:02:18.303
And I said. "It is.
I know it's Bigfoot."

1125
01:02:18.338 --> 01:02:23.308
He's a big and handsome. young
looking ape and...

1126
01:02:25.147 --> 01:02:27.081
I didn't know what to do.
and then he disappeared.

1127
01:02:27.116 --> 01:02:28.082
- Oh. was he handsome?

1128
01:02:28.117 --> 01:02:29.512
Was he really handsome?

1129
01:02:29.547 --> 01:02:31.085
Was he really hairy
chest and everything?

1130
01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.889
Oh!
- Oh my God.

1131
01:02:32.924 --> 01:02:35.089
- My viewers know that
I wrote a bestseller.

1132
01:02:35.124 --> 01:02:38.389
It's called Bigfoot and Dr.
- The True Love Story.

1133
01:02:38.424 --> 01:02:40.831
And we have been
communicating. telepathically.

1134
01:02:40.866 --> 01:02:43.097
He's been coming every
night in my dreams.

1135
01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:45.363
And so we're going to be
going and finding him.

1136
01:02:45.398 --> 01:02:48.839
So are you excited to be on
this expedition with us. Penny?

1137
01:02:48.874 --> 01:02:50.500
- I am so excited.

1138
01:02:50.535 --> 01:02:52.205
Be still my beating heart.

1139
01:02:53.945 --> 01:02:56.176
- We've had a few
expeditions before.

1140
01:02:56.211 --> 01:02:58.882
and some of the girls didn't
make it. unfortunately.

1141
01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.477
Last time we had
a bear incident.

1142
01:03:00.512 --> 01:03:02.380
But this time's
gonna be really good

1143
01:03:02.415 --> 01:03:05.581
'cause we have our guns locked
and loaded and ready to go.

1144
01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:08.056
Yes?
- I have my crossbow.

1145
01:03:08.091 --> 01:03:09.387
And I don't wanna kill Bigfoot.

1146
01:03:09.422 --> 01:03:11.323
but I. we need to be protected.

1147
01:03:11.358 --> 01:03:12.962
- Oh no. we're not
gonna kill him.

1148
01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:15.294
No. no. no. we're gonna.
we're gonna find him.

1149
01:03:15.329 --> 01:03:16.460
We're gonna lure him in.

1150
01:03:16.495 --> 01:03:18.297
We're gonna seduce him.

1151
01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:21.971
And we're gonna have
a relationship. right?

1152
01:03:22.006 --> 01:03:24.006
- That's right.

1153
01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:27.075
- I'm gonna finish my
fantasy book about him

1154
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:28.208
because. oh wow.

1155
01:03:28.243 --> 01:03:30.045
He's so big and handsome.

1156
01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.575
And. oh. I can't wait
to just to meet him

1157
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:34.610
and have him hold
me in his arms.

1158
01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:38.350
and his big. hairy. his big
hairy chest against mine.

1159
01:03:38.385 --> 01:03:41.859
Oh. just to make out and
kiss with him and ooh. ooh!

1160
01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:43.352

where we were last.

- North. West. South. what?

1174
01:04:56.364 --> 01:04:58.001
- I don't know.

1175
01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:00.696
- Well. let's just
take a look around.

1176
01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:01.598
- What is this?

1177
01:05:04.042 --> 01:05:05.943
- Holy moth balls!

1178
01:05:07.012 --> 01:05:08.341
That looks like a piece of crap!

1179
01:05:08.376 --> 01:05:11.080
- Bigfoot's crap!

1180
01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:12.477
- Oh God. what are we gonna do?

1181
01:05:12.512 --> 01:05:15.216
We can't touch it.
- Okay. I got an idea.

1182
01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:17.383
Let's put our energy together.

1183
01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:20.320
and transport it
forward to 2050.

1184
01:05:20.355 --> 01:05:22.025
- That's it. that's it.

1185
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.962
- Beyond
ho. away we go.

1186
01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.998
Beyond ho. away we go.

1187
01:05:29.628 --> 01:05:31.496
Beyond ho. away we go.

1188
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:35.137
Beyond ho. away we go.

1189
01:05:37.537 --> 01:05:41.077
- Holy crap. we're
gonna be trillionaires!

1190
01:05:41.112 --> 01:05:42.144
- I love it!

1191
01:05:44.214 --> 01:05:46.709
- Oh my God. that was a big one!

1192
01:05:56.226 --> 01:05:57.225
- Oh my God.

1193
01:05:58.261 --> 01:06:00.393
- Oh wow.
- What is that?

1194
01:06:01.429 --> 01:06:03.165
It's a hoof print.

1195
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.431
Looks like I'm finally
gonna get my selfie.

1196
01:06:05.466 --> 01:06:07.532
- It's so big.

1197
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:10.403
And you know what they say
about men with big feet?

1198
01:06:10.438 --> 01:06:13.670
- My ex-boyfriend had big
feet. definitely worth it.

1199
01:06:13.705 --> 01:06:17.377
- This monster probably
has pretty big hands too.

1200
01:06:17.412 --> 01:06:19.346
- He's close by.

1201
01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:20.479
- Let's go find him.

1202
01:06:20.514 --> 01:06:21.480
Let's get that selfie for you.

1203
01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:23.086
- Let's get the selfie.

1204
01:06:23.121 --> 01:06:24.087
- Let's go get
this fool. ladies.

1205
01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.759
- I think she's
definitely from the loony bin.

1206
01:06:36.794 --> 01:06:39.465
- Oh yeah.
that's plausible.

1207
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.434
- You know what. we set
out to find Bigfoot.

1208
01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:42.732
Let's just go look for him.

1209
01:06:42.767 --> 01:06:44.074
We'll find her on the way.

1210
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:47.605
- Ladies. I think at this point

1211
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.610
we really gotta accept
there ain't no Bigfoot!

1212
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:26.611
- We may never
see that girl again.

1213
01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:29.152
- Yeah.
- She's lost forever probably.

1214
01:07:29.187 --> 01:07:30.714
- She may be gone for good.

1215
01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:34.190
- Jesse!

1216
01:07:34.225 --> 01:07:35.587
Where have you been?

1217
01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.590
- Don't give me that
look. I know that look.

1218
01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:40.394
- Bitch!
- I know. I know. I know.

1219
01:07:40.429 --> 01:07:43.760
I got up early this
morning. and I was inspired.

1220
01:07:43.795 --> 01:07:45.861
And I always like to
write when I'm inspired.

1221
01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:49.535
And I wrote a song for
our quest to get Bigfoot.

1222
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:50.668
- For what?
- We were worried about you.

1223
01:07:50.703 --> 01:07:52.538
- I wrote a song.

1224
01:07:52.573 --> 01:07:55.244
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
but you'll love the song.

1225
01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:56.674
- So you wrote a song?

1226
01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:57.708
- Of course. it's
about all of us.

1227
01:07:57.743 --> 01:07:59.182
- All right.

1228
01:07:59.217 --> 01:08:00.480
- Actually.
- Can we hear the song?

1229
01:08:00.515 --> 01:08:01.613
- I wanna hear it.
- Yeah.

1230
01:08:01.648 --> 01:08:03.483
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1231
01:08:03.518 --> 01:08:04.880
- Now I wrote it with
like a Western spaghetti.

1232
01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.222
Southern twang kind
of a feel to it.

1233
01:08:06.257 --> 01:08:07.355
Like kind of a like. you know.

1234
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:09.819

1235
01:08:09.854 --> 01:08:12.327

1258
01:09:42.518 --> 01:09:43.484
- We did it.

1259
01:09:43.519 --> 01:09:45.453
Mission accomplished.

1260
01:09:45.488 --> 01:09:47.884
- Yeah. it's time to
go back to the future.

1261
01:09:47.919 --> 01:09:49.259
- Back to 2050.

1262

1263
01:09:51.626 --> 01:09:52.955
We need to change.

1264
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:54.792

1265
01:09:54.827 --> 01:09:55.694

It's getting better.
- Yeah.

1270
01:10:17.652 --> 01:10:18.783
- Maybe a little bit. you know?

1271
01:10:18.818 --> 01:10:20.422
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1272
01:10:22.954 --> 01:10:25.790
Oh yeah. uh huh.
- Beautiful.

1273
01:10:25.825 --> 01:10:28.496

1274
01:10:28.531 --> 01:10:29.926
Go on in there.

Nah. one more.

Now me.

1282
01:11:01.597 --> 01:11:02.530
What do you think?

1283
01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:05.698
We're ready.

1284
01:11:08.769 --> 01:11:11.572
All right. team. we did it.

1285
01:11:12.509 --> 01:11:14.036
We're looking great.

1286
01:11:14.071 --> 01:11:18.007
Time for 2050.

1287
01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:24.387
- Whoa. check out
the red carpet.

1288
01:11:25.918 --> 01:11:27.522
What is this. the
Academy Awards?

1289
01:11:27.557 --> 01:11:28.655
I thought we were
hunting Bigfoot.

1290
01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:30.492
You really didn't have to.

1291
01:11:31.693 --> 01:11:32.791
- What was that?

1292
01:11:32.826 --> 01:11:34.364
That was something big in there.

1293
01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:35.794
- It sure sounded big.

1294
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.504
- That's Bigfoot.
that's Bigfoot!

1295
01:11:42.539 --> 01:11:44.539
- Fuck. I wanna be famous!

1296
01:11:59.688 --> 01:12:00.720
- Did you get an alert?
- Yes. we did.

1297
01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:02.557
He's up on the overlook.

1298
01:12:02.592 --> 01:12:04.625
That critter's up there
right now. let's go. move it.

1299
01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.055
Here you go. let's go.

1300
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:07.529
Come on. move it.

- Got you.

1304
01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:14.635
- Don't you move.

1305
01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:18.100
- Stop. stop. don't hurt him.

1306
01:12:20.577 --> 01:12:23.941
- Oh my God. this
is really happening.

1307
01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:28.847
- Oh!

1308
01:12:33.623 --> 01:12:36.723
- Damn. he's kinda hot.

1309
01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:53.872
- Oh. Bigfoot. I've looked
for you my entire life.

1310
01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:55.511
You're so amazing.

1311
01:12:55.546 --> 01:12:57.876
- You've never hurt
anyone. have you?

1312
01:12:57.911 --> 01:12:58.778

1313
01:13:00.749 --> 01:13:02.914

- Hey ladies. what do you
have cornered up there?

1320
01:13:25.675 --> 01:13:26.773
- Nothing.

1321
01:13:26.808 --> 01:13:28.478
- Ain't nothin' to see here.

1322
01:13:28.513 --> 01:13:30.546
