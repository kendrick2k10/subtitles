Shit. Shit...

7
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.649
Shit.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.070
[chuckles]

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.654
Hi. Angel.

10
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.241
Um. it's good to see you.

11
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.660
Listen. I think you might have
the wrong idea about me. man.

12
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.454
[grunts]

13
00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.332
You got sticky fingers. Lorenzo.

14
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.711
No.
Angel. no!

15
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.880
Anything that this guy's
telling you

16
00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:30.799
or that anybody's telling
you about me skimming.

17
00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.592
they're lying.

18
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.302
So why were you running?

19
00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.514
Full transparency. I didn't
know it was you guys.

20
00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.100
-I've got enemies. okay?
-[phone rings]

21
00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.560
I wonder why.

22
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.146
Whatever you're thinking about
doing. you don't have to do it.

23
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.566
Just let me pay you back.
Please.

24
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.402
Okay. good job.

25
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.528
This is how you pay me back.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.280
[groans]

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.074
[slicing sounds]

28
00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:57.075
I'll tell Angel.
You let Fleck know.

29
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.132
That was Jose.

30
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.967
I think he found your girl.

31
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.061
Excellent.

32
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.941
[sighs]

33
00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.234
I'm seriously regretting
my decision.

34
00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.902
I'm gonna look like an idiot.

35
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.779
Oh. but you're so cute when
you look like an idiot.

36
00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.656
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah.

37
00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.244
So. yeah. at some point.

38
00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.496
we should start
planning this wedding.

39
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.957
You're right. and when
you're right. you're right.

40
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.250
And don't you forget it.

41
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.002
Oh. that reminds me...

42
00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.171
Shelby wants us to pick up candy
corn for the party tonight.

43
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.089
Oh. candy corn is crucial.

44
00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.592
I never got into it.
But I can see the appeal.

45
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:07.682
[phone rings]

46
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.517
Hi. Crystal.

47
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.604
What?

48
00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.565
What about Andre
or Alena or Warren?

49
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.485
What's wrong?

50
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.615
Are you kidding me. Crystal?
That's so unfair.

51
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:24.991
Not tonight.

52
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.701
I haven't had
a day off in weeks.

53
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.998
Brandon. there's
someone watching us.

54
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.792
What?

55
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.270
Okay. fine. but you owe me huge.

56
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:56.648
Bye.

57
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.235
-Who was it?
-I don't know.

58
00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.361
-I didn't see anyone.
-Are you kidding?

59
00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.571
He was right there watching us.

60
00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.156
Probably just some
trick or treaters.

61
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.245
I have to go in to work tonight.
Inventory issue.

62
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.540
-Tonight?
-No one else is available.

63
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.874
But Crystal said it should
only be a few hours

64
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.960
and she'd pay me
time and a half.

65
00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.837
That sucks.

66
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.838
I know.

67
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.551
Um. will you wait for me?

68
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.345
I have to shower
and get changed.

69
00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.638
Who needs to shower
when you've got this?

70
00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.641
What are you doing?

71
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.568
Mission accomplished.
You're smiling again.

72
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.361
Join me.
I dare you.

73
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.904
Oh. yeah?

74
00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.322
Yeah.

75
00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.086
[chuckles]

76
00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.058
Hey. Brandon.
I just closed up at work.

77
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.645
I'm the last one here.
so I hope you're on your way

78
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.439
because I don't wanna wait
around outside for too long.

79
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.274
Some folks may get
the wrong idea.

80
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.111
Anyway. if you can call me back.
that'd be great.

81
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.279
Okay?
Love you.

82
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.869
Hard day at work. Sofia?

83
00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.914
Fleck?
What are you doing here?

84
00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.958
Rude.

85
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.751
Long time. no see.

86
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.757
Did Angel put you up to this?

87
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.758
You know I've never
done that shit.

88
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:29.801
It's just coke.

89
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.469
I'm not touching that.

90
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.680
Come on.

91
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.099
It only hurts
'til it feels good.

92
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.519
Then it's real good.

93
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.896
How did you even find me?

94
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.733
Angel's been looking
for you for months.

95
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.568
He wants to put
the past behind him.

96
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.695
And you expect
me to do what?

97
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.223
Stop!

98
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.188
You should really walk away.

99
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.357
As soon as you
shoot up. I'm out.

100
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.861
My fiancé's gonna kick your ass.

101
00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:31.446
Oh. I'm so scared.

102
00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.492
Sorry. I'm late.

103
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.160
-What's going on?
-He found me. We have to go.

104
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.244
-Wait. who found you?
-Let's get out of here!

105
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.793
Gilbert disabled the bike.

106
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:51.049
Meet up with him and grab them
before they hit the main road.

107
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.301
Asshole knocked a filling loose!

108
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.102
Who was that guy?

109
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.395
Did he hurt you?

110
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.313
I'm fine.
He works for Angel.

111
00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.856
Your ex?

112
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.400
I didn't think
he'd try to find me.

113
00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.901
Yeah. I think
he's not over you yet.

114
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.653
Let's go.

115
00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:12.904
-He parked his bike around here!
-They're following us!

116
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.698
[engine sputters]

117
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.032
Are you kidding me?

118
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.867
Somebody yanked my fuel line.

119
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.035
There they are!

120
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.412
We gotta run.

121
00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.303
Gotcha!

122
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.430
Brandon. we have
to get out of here.

123
00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.848
They're not gonna let us go.

124
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.932
Angel doesn't give up.
We have to go.

125
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.726
Go where?

126
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.310
We head back that way.
we're boxed into an underpass.

127
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.770
Across the bridge is
the only way out of there.

128
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:46.813
We're not gonna make it
across the bridge.

129
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:47.814
Brandon. they'll kill us.

130
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.024
We'll see.

131
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.071
Listen. if you have a chance.

132
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.033
a moment when they're not
looking at you. you take it.

133
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.159
Don't worry about me.

134
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.535
I'm not leaving you!

135
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:07.250
This is all my fault. Brandon.

136
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.252
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't be.

137
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.587
You're worth it.

138
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.970
Let me handle him.
This could be fun.

139
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:19.971
You sure?

140
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.639
Oh. I got this.

141
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.564
You know.
we only wanted the girl.

142
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:30.982
Yeah. I got that.

143
00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:34.277
-Do me a favor. Fleck.
-Absolutely.

144
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.196
Go around the bridge
and make sure Sofia

145
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.156
doesn't ditch her fiancé.

146
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.158
Yep. yep.

147
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.411
You didn't have to be a part of
this. but now you're in the way.

148
00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.746
And it's going
to stay that way.

149
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:53.963
Show me what you got!

150
00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:57.008
[grunting]

151
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.435
[shouts]

152
00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:15.777
So pretty!

153
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.904
Angel wants to say hi.

154
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.114
Calm down.

155
00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:22.826
[grunting]

156
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.796
Personally. I don't get it.

157
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.256
Get what?

158
00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.258
What she sees in you.

159
00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.182
Should keep the bang-bang
to a minimum.

160
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.434
LAPD loves that sound!

161
00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.270
Yeah. yeah.

162
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.981
No!

163
00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.485
The name's Angel. by the way.

164
00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:58.486
Nice to meet you!

165
00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.946
Stop. leave him alone!

166
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.957
You were very hard to find.

167
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.376
But worth it.

168
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.461
You son of a--

169
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.629
Agh!

170
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.757
I've been called worse.

171
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.675
Why did you do this?

172
00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.969
What can I say?

173
00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:27.599
You were the one
who got away. Sofia.

174
00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.184
After all these years.

175
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.519
I'm still not over
my high school sweetheart.

176
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.980
Hey there. let me see it.

177
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.443
Nice rock.

178
00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.694
Layaway plan?

179
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:40.695
I never loved you.

180
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.407
[Brandon groans]

181
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.660
Hey. look!

182
00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.204
Look at this.

183
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.124
No!

184
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.420
He's a bullet sponge.

185
00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:00.215
Hey! Angel.
Let's get outta here!

186
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.008
Cops will be on us!

187
00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.301
This is all your fault.

188
00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.303
You should feel terrible
about this.

189
00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:08.640
You do understand that. if
I can't have you. no one can.

190
00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:14.062
But maybe I'm being too hasty.

191
00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.565
She's going to work for us.

192
00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.734
Work for us?
Are you serious?

193
00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:20.819
Dead serious.

194
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.323
She'll mule for us.

195
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.326
Besides. we need a new body
now that Miguel got pinched.

196
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.245
She won't cooperate!

197
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:32.038
Luckily. it's not up to her.

198
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.457
Javier is not going
to like this.

199
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.043
What will stop her from
yapping to the Federales?

200
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.337
Because I know where
mommy and daddy are now.

201
00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:44.551
Oh. yeah. I found them. too.

202
00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.180
I wonder if they remember me.

203
00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:53.977
She talks.
I gut them like fish.

204
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.313
She plays along...

205
00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.857
maybe she gets to like it.

206
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.359
Shall we?

207
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:06.823
Still alive?

208
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.617
Oh. my God. Brandon!

209
00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:15.123
Jesus.
This one is for the scrapbook!

210
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:17.083
He's like a roach!

211
00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.585
Then we should smash him.

212
00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:21.838
'Tis the season...

213
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.509
Stop! Leave him alone!

214
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.848
Oh. don't worry about it.

215
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.559
In 24 hours. you'll be
across the border.

216
00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.144
No!

217
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.355
And so doped out of your mind

218
00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.940
that you can't even
remember your own name.

219
00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.151
Happy Halloween. son!

220
00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.111
No!

221
00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.364
[laughing]

222
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:53.620
Smile.

223
00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.882
Funny boy?
How's this?

224
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.344
Is that funny for you?

225
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.346
Let's go. Fleck!

226
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.141
Help! Please!

227
00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.768
God...

228
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:36.371
[cackling]

229
00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.553
My! They have left you
in shambles. friend.

230
00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.229
Who are you?

231
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.607
You called for help.
Help has arrived.

232
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.736
Look at you.

233
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.612
Pitiful end.

234
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.991
Police...

235
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.117
[chuckles]

236
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.744
You can forget about that.

237
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.996
You're dead and gone now.

238
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.749
You live now on my behalf.

239
00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:23.710
You cried out and I heard

240
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.629
because I'm always listening
for the wayward soul.

241
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.426
I'm always in the market
for a bargain.

242
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:35.513
looking for those willing
to risk it all.

243
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.015
You're not real.

244
00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.643
I haven't got all night
and neither do you.

245
00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.897
Sofia... they've taken her.

246
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.690
Oh. I know.

247
00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:49.861
I saw and you want her back.

248
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.404
Yes!

249
00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:54.699
And you want that dirty
drug dealer piece of trash

250
00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.451
and all of his men dead!

251
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:57.577
Yes!

252
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.662
I want something too.

253
00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.164
Quid pro quo.

254
00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.665
You want a do-over?

255
00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:06.461
I will give you what you
need to accomplish that.

256
00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:09.172
-For a price.
-There's always a price.

257
00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.926
If you thought different.
you'd be lying to yourself.

258
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.470
Nothing in life or
death is free. kid.

259
00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.389
What do you want?

260
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.809
If we're gonna go forward
and I'm gonna share

261
00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.936
the details of our agreement.

262
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.272
you will be forfeiting
your final asset.

263
00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.983
My soul...

264
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.194
but how do I know--

265
00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.570
That I can do what
I say I can do?

266
00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.489
That I am who I say I am?

267
00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.158
You see that carcass?

268
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.538
Wanna see him dance?

269
00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.169
What happens to my soul after?

270
00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:53.091
Stays with me safe and sound
and warm year round.

271
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:56.094
Now I will give you the tools
and you will do the dirty work.

272
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.555
How?

273
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.056
I will give
you the means

274
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.767
to bring about your
righteous vengeance.

275
00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.022
You kill them. I claim them.

276
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.733
I collect all
the souls you harvest.

277
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.776
You can have every
last one of them.

278
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.738
You get 24 hours to do it.

279
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.867
After that. it's too late
for you and your lady love.

280
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.827
Understood.

281
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.203
Do we have a deal?

282
00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.583
Very well.

283
00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.544
Let's turn you into
an instrument

284
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.756
of brimstone-fueled fury.

285
00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.633
How are you gonna do that?

286
00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.386
Every hero needs
a right-hand man.

287
00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.642
With this.
you will be unstoppable.

288
00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:48.396
You will be the instrument
of the vengeance you desire.

289
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.193
I will plant the seed...

290
00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.782
that allows you to flower.

291
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.367
There now.

292
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.371
Don't resist it. kid.

293
00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:05.663
Embrace it.

294
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:10.669
Now that is a thing of beauty.

295
00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.921
You are going to put
the fear of...

296
00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.631
of God into...

297
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.801
one more thing.
one more thing.

298
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.178
There!

299
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.013
There. now we're talking.

300
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:25.809
Now you have a gift that you can
turn on and off as need be.

301
00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:28.687
You can walk
among mortals in disguise.

302
00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:35.110
How do I work this thing?

303
00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:36.528
Practice makes perfect.

304
00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:42.325
You see that dimwit
bag of bones?

305
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.743
See what you can do.

306
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.845
Soulmates. huh?

307
00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.730
So why this guy?

308
00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:19.279
What does... did...
he have that I don't?

309
00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:26.453
Seriously. humor me.
I'm looking to improve.

310
00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.796
I understand the need
to feel optimistic.

311
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.300
But. come on.
let's be real here.

312
00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.516
You'll love Mexico
this time of year.

313
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.481
Who am I kidding?
Sucks all year round.

314
00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:55.899
Always smells like
piss and garbage.

315
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.150
[car honking]

316
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.237
What now?

317
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.701
What's up?

318
00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:07.952
I feel like an idiot.

319
00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.287
What else is new.
What happened?

320
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:10.413
I gotta go back.

321
00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:11.956
For what?
To get arrested?

322
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.125
I think I dropped my phone.
I can't find it.

323
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.335
Maybe when the
douchebag tripped me.

324
00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:16.419
Are you kidding me right now?

325
00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:18.088
I know. I know.

326
00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:19.714
I'll be quick.
but I can't leave it behind.

327
00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:21.508
I'll circle back
before the cops show up.

328
00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:24.761
Meet me back at the house.

329
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:28.014
If you get pinched.
call Moira. not me.

330
00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:29.766
It's not my first rodeo.

331
00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:35.480
[grunts]

332
00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:37.941
Now this beauty packs
quite a wallop. kid.

333
00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:38.942
Give it a try.

334
00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:49.160
Don't tell me
that you're feeling bad

335
00:22:49.244 --> 00:22:50.537
about this bag of bones!

336
00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:55.625
I've never killed anyone before.

337
00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:57.419
You never forget the first time.

338
00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:00.714
Okay. look.

339
00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:02.507
If it'll make you feel
any better. this guy.

340
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.802
he killed two innocent women
a couple years ago.

341
00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.178
And he got away with it.

342
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:22.193
Not too shabby. huh?

343
00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:24.070
What if I hurt innocent people?

344
00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:26.573
It's on you.
I still get the souls.

345
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:30.452
Look. kid. just make sure
that the intended victim

346
00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:33.288
is on the other end
of that glove.

347
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:35.415
Now I gave you a little
special something

348
00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:37.625
for those people
you like the least.

349
00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:39.919
You want a little extra oomph?

350
00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:42.630
Give in to your rage.
Give in to your anger.

351
00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:47.469
Ooh!

352
00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:52.432
When you get all hot and
bothered. boy. can you cook!

353
00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:55.268
Just will it and
the gauntlet will obey!

354
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.528
Blow a hole in him.

355
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:18.750
I wasn't expecting that!

356
00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:21.336
No one ever is.
That's why it's my favorite.

357
00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:22.545
Let's go again.

358
00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:23.838
I want you to get
more comfortable

359
00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:25.423
with your little friend there.

360
00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:28.134
The more you practice.
the more souls I get.

361
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:36.267
Kid. let me ask you something.

362
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:38.353
What is it with you
and this girl. huh?

363
00:24:38.436 --> 00:24:41.064
You know. the human connections.
they intrigue me.

364
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:43.191
Is it love at
first sight or what?

365
00:24:45.068 --> 00:24:47.862
When I first met her. she was
working at a coffee shop.

366
00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:49.864
Gave me free refills.

367
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:52.575
Such a small thing.

368
00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:55.954
but the way she looked at me.

369
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.997
she noticed me.

370
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:02.168
Made me feel
like I accomplished something.

371
00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:07.465
It might not make sense.
but it's all I got.

372
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:10.760
Hey. you know. I guess you
got your priorities straight.

373
00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:13.013
Let's kill this fool.

374
00:25:13.096 --> 00:25:15.682
Honestly. I could
do this all night.

375
00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:29.154
Holy shit!

376
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:34.451
He's alive?

377
00:25:52.344 --> 00:25:53.928
I think you're starting
to like it. kid.

378
00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:55.638
I don't think like's
the right word.

379
00:25:55.722 --> 00:25:57.724
Appreciate it. Whatever.

380
00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:04.230
Am I high?

381
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:10.612
I'm ready.

382
00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:12.364
I believe you are.

383
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.824
Now you've got 24 hours
to bring Sofia back

384
00:26:14.908 --> 00:26:16.826
before I drag you down with me.

385
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.537
And one other thing.
you are in human flesh.

386
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:22.248
Remember that.

387
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:24.459
Meaning what?
I thought I was dead.

388
00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:26.378
Yes and no.

389
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:30.173
You can't die.
but pain is still pain.

390
00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:32.842
You are bound by
certain human limitations.

391
00:26:32.926 --> 00:26:35.512
which means you will slow down.

392
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:39.599
And you will need
to refuel and recharge.

393
00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:42.394
I'll have to eat?

394
00:26:42.477 --> 00:26:44.104
Yes. and not normal food.

395
00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:46.189
Blood. human blood.

396
00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:48.817
It's the closest thing to
a soul's physical essence.

397
00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:06.209
Who's there?

398
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:09.087
They won't know what
hit 'em. kid.

399
00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:13.466
[cackling]

400
00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:54.674
I get it.

401
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.093
I gotta eat.

402
00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:09.564
What are we gonna do
with you. Horse?

403
00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:15.111
Attaboy!

404
00:28:52.732 --> 00:28:54.109
Welcome home!

405
00:28:54.192 --> 00:28:56.111
Take her to an upstairs bedroom.

406
00:28:56.194 --> 00:28:59.989
And give her a tea or
something and lock the door.

407
00:29:01.449 --> 00:29:02.701
I'll be missed!

408
00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:04.494
People will look for me. Angel.

409
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:06.621
Well. they won't find you.

410
00:29:06.705 --> 00:29:08.456
You're disgusting.

411
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.001
Tomorrow afternoon. we'll prep
you for your big trip.

412
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:12.585
So get some rest.

413
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:15.338
And if you need help
getting some sleep.

414
00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:17.549
maybe I can give you something.

415
00:29:36.234 --> 00:29:37.527
Please. you don't
have to do this.

416
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.154
You can let me go.

417
00:29:39.237 --> 00:29:40.739
I'll tell the cops you had
nothing to do with this.

418
00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:42.407
Not my problem.

419
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.451
Please. he's crazy.
He's going to kill me.

420
00:29:44.534 --> 00:29:47.954
Not. My. Problem.

421
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.639
You hungry? Thirsty?

422
00:30:06.723 --> 00:30:07.891
No.

423
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:11.811
Okay.

424
00:30:13.313 --> 00:30:14.606
Wait! No!

425
00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:17.692
No! Please don't do this!

426
00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:19.069
Please!

427
00:30:34.376 --> 00:30:35.877
[sobs]

428
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.716
[shouts]

429
00:30:45.428 --> 00:30:46.346
[screams]

430
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:22.340
What happened to you?

431
00:31:22.424 --> 00:31:27.053
You're not gonna believe it.

432
00:31:27.137 --> 00:31:28.805
I'm a little shook.

433
00:31:33.351 --> 00:31:38.273
Okay. So now that we're
unshaken. what happened?

434
00:31:38.356 --> 00:31:42.402
That kid. Brandon.
He's alive.

435
00:31:42.485 --> 00:31:44.362
And you stopped that
from being true. right?

436
00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:47.157
He's dead!
I mean. he's alive!

437
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.284
I mean. it's one of those two!

438
00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:50.910
What are you talking about?

439
00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:54.080
Like I said. he's back.
but he's not normal.

440
00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:56.791
He's got a flaming pumpkin
on his head

441
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:58.793
and a claw that does crazy shit!

442
00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:00.754
Speaking of crazy...

443
00:32:00.837 --> 00:32:03.882
I know it sounds nuts!

444
00:32:03.965 --> 00:32:06.593
But he sold
his soul to the devil.

445
00:32:06.676 --> 00:32:09.012
I saw him talking
to this old guy.

446
00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:11.598
He said he has
24 hours to save Sofia

447
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:13.516
before he drags him to hell.

448
00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:16.728
-Wow.
-Right?

449
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:22.734
Are you high right now?

450
00:32:22.817 --> 00:32:23.777
No!

451
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.320
No.

452
00:32:25.403 --> 00:32:29.407
You know I don't use anymore!

453
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:31.618
I mean. socially. yes.
but not on a daily.

454
00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:33.995
I'm clean-ish!

455
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:35.413
Clean-ish!

456
00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:38.375
Regardless.
I'm not high right now!

457
00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:43.129
So boyfriend guy sold
his soul to the devil.

458
00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:45.465
And he's coming to kick our ass.

459
00:32:46.883 --> 00:32:48.176
Hmm.

460
00:32:50.637 --> 00:32:54.015
Keep it.
Get some rest. My treat.

461
00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:56.601
-Where are you going?
-Off to the office.

462
00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:59.437
Gotta prep for our new
mule's travel arrangements.

463
00:33:01.898 --> 00:33:03.483
You don't believe me.

464
00:33:05.318 --> 00:33:07.362
Don't believe me.

465
00:33:58.496 --> 00:33:59.456
Excuse me.

466
00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:01.416
S'up?

467
00:34:01.499 --> 00:34:04.461
You. uh...
You lookin' for somethin'?

468
00:34:04.544 --> 00:34:06.463
No. I was hoping you boys
can help me.

469
00:34:06.546 --> 00:34:08.631
Been driving around all
night wasting my time.

470
00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:11.676
So now you've decided
to waste mine!

471
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.970
Why don't you just
keep drivin'. pal?

472
00:34:14.054 --> 00:34:15.430
I'm looking for Angel.

473
00:34:15.513 --> 00:34:16.931
Well. we ain't hiring.

474
00:34:17.015 --> 00:34:18.641
We've business to discuss.

475
00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:22.937
Now somethin' about you
doesn't sit right with me.

476
00:34:23.021 --> 00:34:24.731
That's a damn shame.

477
00:34:24.814 --> 00:34:26.733
Bro. walk off. Step away.

478
00:34:26.816 --> 00:34:30.362
Yeah. Shouldn't you be like
at a magician's ball

479
00:34:30.445 --> 00:34:32.113
or a masquerade party?

480
00:34:32.197 --> 00:34:33.865
Yeah. Where's your
little rabbit. huh?

481
00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:39.662
Why don't we make him disappear?
You know? Dead.

482
00:34:39.746 --> 00:34:41.331
Why don't you guys
help me find Angel

483
00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:43.249
and I'll let you get
a new line of work?

484
00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:45.669
Dude. walk away!

485
00:34:45.752 --> 00:34:48.296
You wouldn't be the first idiot
we cap in broad daylight.

486
00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.173
I mean. you know.
my man's connected. right?

487
00:34:50.256 --> 00:34:51.883
Cops ain't a thing around here.

488
00:34:51.966 --> 00:34:53.885
Just looking for Angel.

489
00:34:53.968 --> 00:34:55.053
He ain't around here. pal.

490
00:34:55.136 --> 00:34:57.055
Try the library.

491
00:34:57.138 --> 00:34:59.182
So you're gonna force me
to convince you. huh?

492
00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:02.102
What are you gonna do about it?

493
00:35:02.185 --> 00:35:04.813
Go ahead. Convince us.

494
00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:16.282
What are you. man?

495
00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:17.742
The last thing you'll see alive.

496
00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:19.494
Where's Angel?

497
00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:21.371
Listen. man. You don't wanna
go to war with Angel.

498
00:35:21.454 --> 00:35:23.039
He doesn't give up easy. man!

499
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:25.291
Same here! Now where is he and
where did he take Sofia?

500
00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:28.044
I don't know who Sofia is.
but I sure hope she's worth it.

501
00:35:28.128 --> 00:35:29.963
She is.

502
00:35:30.046 --> 00:35:31.589
If you want the boss.
he'll be at the factory.

503
00:35:31.673 --> 00:35:33.049
He's almost always there.

504
00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:34.634
It's like a secret base.

505
00:35:34.718 --> 00:35:36.011
The cops don't even touch it.

506
00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:37.095
How do I get there?

507
00:35:37.178 --> 00:35:38.722
Next town over in Candlewood.

508
00:35:38.805 --> 00:35:41.057
It's on the corner of. uh...

509
00:35:41.141 --> 00:35:44.060
Crimswell...
Crimswell and Hamlin!

510
00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:46.938
Made shoes or some crap there.

511
00:35:47.022 --> 00:35:49.107
See? Being helpful is easy.

512
00:35:50.692 --> 00:35:53.153
You're 100% right.
Eat shit!

513
00:35:53.236 --> 00:35:54.946
[grunts]

514
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.114
[groans]

515
00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:40.492
[laughing]

516
00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:42.369
Gracias. Javier.

517
00:36:42.452 --> 00:36:45.121
You'll love her.

518
00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:46.498
Yeah.

519
00:36:46.581 --> 00:36:48.166
Hasta luego. amigo.

520
00:36:52.796 --> 00:36:53.797
You wanted to see me?

521
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.383
Moira. come on in.

522
00:36:56.466 --> 00:36:58.885
If this is about
the Panama situation.

523
00:36:58.968 --> 00:37:01.304
we are still in
limbo due to Customs.

524
00:37:01.388 --> 00:37:04.891
Panama can wait.
It's fake ID time.

525
00:37:04.974 --> 00:37:07.727
The Feds are still sniffing
around from last time.

526
00:37:07.811 --> 00:37:09.145
No.

527
00:37:09.229 --> 00:37:11.523
I hate the word no.

528
00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:13.525
I have an aversion to it.

529
00:37:13.608 --> 00:37:14.943
I understand that...

530
00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:16.403
Maybe it's from that time
that I was

531
00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:18.154
ripping that guy's eyelids out.

532
00:37:18.238 --> 00:37:22.909
And he kept screaming. "No! No!"
like it would make me stop!

533
00:37:22.992 --> 00:37:25.328
I know.
I was there.

534
00:37:25.412 --> 00:37:28.081
You know. maybe I just
burned out on the word.

535
00:37:28.164 --> 00:37:30.709
Besides. it's for
a dear friend of mine.

536
00:37:30.792 --> 00:37:32.419
I'm sure it is. but--

537
00:37:32.502 --> 00:37:34.212
I need to tie up
loose ends. Moira.

538
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:38.299
Javier knows.
I just called him.

539
00:37:38.383 --> 00:37:40.719
It's got to happen. Moira.

540
00:37:42.595 --> 00:37:46.057
It's going to take major
cash to make that happen.

541
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:47.225
You want the works?

542
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:48.768
Passport. driver's license...

543
00:37:48.852 --> 00:37:52.063
You bet. and tonight.

544
00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:53.314
Oh. boy.

545
00:37:53.398 --> 00:37:55.275
I'm gonna call Luis.

546
00:37:55.358 --> 00:37:57.110
He's usually pretty good about
this kind of stuff.

547
00:38:24.304 --> 00:38:25.472
Hello?

548
00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:50.038
[grunting]

549
00:38:58.463 --> 00:38:59.631
[groans]

550
00:39:02.342 --> 00:39:04.010
Gracias. Luis.

551
00:39:04.094 --> 00:39:05.929
Adios.

552
00:39:06.012 --> 00:39:07.597
Twenty.

553
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:10.600
What?

554
00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:13.561
The last package was 10 large.

555
00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:16.022
Well. it's 20 grand
for a rush job.

556
00:39:16.106 --> 00:39:17.732
He's giving us a deal.

557
00:39:17.816 --> 00:39:21.069
-For a just in case?
-This is your just in case.

558
00:39:21.152 --> 00:39:23.947
He wouldn't budge.
My guy is the guy.

559
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.240
You know his quality work.

560
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:32.163
I don't trust easily.

561
00:39:32.247 --> 00:39:33.873
As a matter of fact.

562
00:39:33.957 --> 00:39:37.002
I can count on one hand
how many people I do trust.

563
00:39:37.085 --> 00:39:42.340
And you. Moira.
are on that hand.

564
00:39:42.424 --> 00:39:43.967
If you screw me.

565
00:39:46.845 --> 00:39:50.765
I'd have to cut
the finger off.

566
00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:51.975
Clear?

567
00:39:52.058 --> 00:39:57.397
Legit items are expensive items.

568
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.775
And you're not skimming any
off the top for yourself?

569
00:40:00.859 --> 00:40:02.819
Now would I do that to you?

570
00:40:04.654 --> 00:40:06.614
I knew the eyelids guy.

571
00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:11.202
[chuckling]

572
00:40:12.954 --> 00:40:14.414
Make it happen.

573
00:40:14.497 --> 00:40:17.000
But it's all gotta be
in my hands by tonight.

574
00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:19.669
Done and done.

575
00:40:19.753 --> 00:40:22.213
How crowded is the border?

576
00:40:22.297 --> 00:40:25.383
Oh. the last report was there's
roadkill all over Texas.

577
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:28.011
But we are golden
through Chula Vista.

578
00:40:28.094 --> 00:40:29.846
No checkpoints?

579
00:40:29.929 --> 00:40:33.224
Nope. They pulled up stakes a
couple days ago. moved north.

580
00:40:34.934 --> 00:40:37.604
We could flow some
dough while we're at it.

581
00:40:37.687 --> 00:40:41.024
No. No. I want a clean
transport just in case.

582
00:40:41.107 --> 00:40:42.442
I wanna make sure
this little lady

583
00:40:42.525 --> 00:40:45.695
gets there without any hassle.

584
00:40:45.779 --> 00:40:47.947
Yeah. her trouble happens later.

585
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:50.909
Absolutely.

586
00:40:55.205 --> 00:40:57.540
[gagging]

587
00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:29.864
Oh. hell. no!

588
00:41:36.746 --> 00:41:38.415
What was that?

589
00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:39.749
Are you packing. Moira?

590
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:41.793
No!

591
00:41:41.876 --> 00:41:42.877
You think it's a police raid?

592
00:41:45.005 --> 00:41:46.548
They wouldn't dare.

593
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:53.930
[groaning]

594
00:42:04.691 --> 00:42:05.984
I'm out!

595
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.163
Put it down!

596
00:42:19.247 --> 00:42:20.415
Yeah. right.

597
00:42:23.084 --> 00:42:25.712
No. no! Wait. wait!
Wait. no. no!

598
00:42:25.795 --> 00:42:27.005
[screams]

599
00:42:32.135 --> 00:42:33.136
Oh. God.

600
00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:34.512
Where is Angel?

601
00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:35.638
Do not kill me!

602
00:42:35.722 --> 00:42:37.140
I'm not here for you!

603
00:42:37.223 --> 00:42:38.266
You just missed him.

604
00:42:39.517 --> 00:42:40.727
[grunts]

605
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.774
Son of a bitch!

606
00:42:45.857 --> 00:42:47.192
You are alive.

607
00:42:47.275 --> 00:42:49.027
Where is Sofia?

608
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.237
If I don't answer you.
you're going to kill me. right?

609
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:53.406
I'm gonna kill you anyway.
Now where is she?

610
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.867
Now if you kill me.
you'll never find her.

611
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.078
Tell me where she is and
I'll make this painless.

612
00:42:58.161 --> 00:42:59.496
I used to say
that to people too.

613
00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:00.872
but death is never painless.

614
00:43:00.955 --> 00:43:02.415
So don't try and
make me feel better.

615
00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:05.960
You brought this on yourself.
now where...

616
00:43:06.044 --> 00:43:07.379
where is she?

617
00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:08.963
[groaning]

618
00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:17.681
Well. I'd love
to stay and chat.

619
00:43:17.764 --> 00:43:19.808
But something tells me you're
not gonna stay down for long.

620
00:43:22.268 --> 00:43:24.604
Moira. I suggest
you find an exit.

621
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.776
Oh...

622
00:43:29.859 --> 00:43:31.778
Oh. please don't kill me!
I'm not a bad guy.

623
00:43:31.861 --> 00:43:32.904
I'm not supposed
to die like this!

624
00:43:32.987 --> 00:43:34.197
Tell me where Sofia is!

625
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.824
I don't know her!

626
00:43:35.907 --> 00:43:38.410
Okay. Where does he live?
Tell me that.

627
00:43:38.493 --> 00:43:39.661
Angel?

628
00:43:39.744 --> 00:43:41.413
He lives way. way out of town.

629
00:43:41.496 --> 00:43:43.998
And I don't even know if
he's going home right now.

630
00:43:44.082 --> 00:43:45.208
Where could he be headed?

631
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:46.751
I don't know!

632
00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:48.128
Like I told you.
he doesn't tell me anything.

633
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:50.463
This is a kind of
a need to know business!

634
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:51.881
Okay.

635
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:53.216
Now is where I ask
for his address again.

636
00:43:53.299 --> 00:43:55.844
I can't tell you that.

637
00:43:55.927 --> 00:43:58.054
Then you must
not value your life.

638
00:43:58.138 --> 00:44:00.348
It's client confidentiality.

639
00:44:09.357 --> 00:44:11.860
7875 Candle Ave.

640
00:44:11.943 --> 00:44:12.902
Got you!

641
00:44:39.346 --> 00:44:41.848
I'll be back in a few to give
you something real nice.

642
00:44:41.931 --> 00:44:43.641
It'll help you sleep.

643
00:44:43.725 --> 00:44:47.479
And when you awake.
you'll be in sunny Mexico.

644
00:45:22.972 --> 00:45:24.516
Eyes peeled!

645
00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:26.017
Be on high alert!

646
00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:27.227
You got it. boss.

647
00:45:37.654 --> 00:45:42.951
So...
today was a little messy.

648
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.664
Had a visit from an old friend.

649
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:52.585
A dead one. actually.

650
00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:55.964
I told you.

651
00:45:56.047 --> 00:45:59.342
I seen some shit.
but that was some shit!

652
00:46:01.344 --> 00:46:03.805
So on top of everything that
we have to worry about.

653
00:46:03.888 --> 00:46:06.808
we have a new problem.

654
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.565
This piece of trash sold
his soul to the devil.

655
00:46:13.648 --> 00:46:16.943
which apparently
is a real damn thing.

656
00:46:17.027 --> 00:46:20.739
And he's gunning for me
and he's gunning for you!

657
00:46:20.822 --> 00:46:23.283
I'm next!

658
00:46:23.366 --> 00:46:25.285
You're next!
You're next!

659
00:46:25.368 --> 00:46:26.953
We're all next!

660
00:46:27.037 --> 00:46:32.375
And this Brandon guy
is 100% fairly unstoppable...

661
00:46:35.045 --> 00:46:36.046
at the moment.

662
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:38.965
Brandon?

663
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:48.975
Fleck... you said something
about 24 hours.

664
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.811
That s what I heard.

665
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:53.396
That's as long as
he said Brandon had

666
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.689
before he dragged him to hell.

667
00:46:57.025 --> 00:46:58.735
So. time is running
short for him. right?

668
00:47:00.528 --> 00:47:05.241
So it's just a game
of keep-away. really.

669
00:47:06.576 --> 00:47:08.703
No. No!

670
00:47:09.788 --> 00:47:12.248
Let's just wait it out.

671
00:47:12.332 --> 00:47:14.209
Hunker down here.

672
00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:16.419
Let's Alamo his ass.

673
00:47:16.503 --> 00:47:18.046
Even if he comes here.

674
00:47:18.129 --> 00:47:19.881
I don't have enough
bodies to throw at him.

675
00:47:19.964 --> 00:47:23.343
No offense. fellas. but
that's what you're paid for.

676
00:47:27.597 --> 00:47:30.934
Holy ground.

677
00:47:31.017 --> 00:47:33.853
Devil dealers aren't allowed
on holy ground. right?

678
00:47:34.938 --> 00:47:36.439
I have no idea.

679
00:47:39.651 --> 00:47:40.694
It's worth a shot.

680
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.446
I'm coming. Brandon.

681
00:47:45.198 --> 00:47:48.076
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
How'd you get outta your room?

682
00:47:48.159 --> 00:47:50.036
[grunts]

683
00:47:56.626 --> 00:47:57.544
[whispers]
Sorry.

684
00:48:05.135 --> 00:48:06.344
[whistles]

685
00:48:06.428 --> 00:48:07.554
[grunts]

686
00:48:11.057 --> 00:48:14.060
Someplace ridiculously far away!

687
00:48:14.144 --> 00:48:15.270
Someplace holy!

688
00:48:15.353 --> 00:48:16.938
A church or something!

689
00:48:17.022 --> 00:48:18.898
-Boss?
-Yes!

690
00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:22.694
The girl got away!

691
00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:24.404
You're kidding!
Brandon's here?

692
00:48:24.487 --> 00:48:26.281
-Who?
-Never mind!

693
00:48:26.364 --> 00:48:27.574
Find her!

694
00:48:27.657 --> 00:48:28.700
Go!

695
00:48:28.783 --> 00:48:30.410
Go! Go!

696
00:48:33.496 --> 00:48:34.497
Go. Fleck.

697
00:48:54.893 --> 00:48:56.353
Hey!

698
00:48:56.436 --> 00:48:57.812
We need to talk.

699
00:48:57.896 --> 00:49:00.440
Back away.
Pretend you didn't see me.

700
00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:04.486
Put in a good word with
your guy for me. huh?

701
00:49:04.569 --> 00:49:09.240
I mean. I know I'm going to
hell. but I'm in no rush.

702
00:49:09.324 --> 00:49:10.825
What are you talking about?

703
00:49:10.909 --> 00:49:13.536
If I let you go.
maybe he'll go easy on me.

704
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.205
Bygones and shit.

705
00:49:15.288 --> 00:49:16.206
Screw you!

706
00:49:17.832 --> 00:49:22.337
Really?
The safety's on!

707
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.964
How are we supposed to cooperate
if we can't see eye to eye?

708
00:49:25.048 --> 00:49:26.633
I'm trying to be nice here!

709
00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:29.928
Anything over here?

710
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:31.137
Hey! I found her!

711
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.061
[whistles]

712
00:49:38.144 --> 00:49:40.063
I'm not going to let
you send me to Mexico.

713
00:49:45.026 --> 00:49:46.903
Not sure if you knew.

714
00:49:46.986 --> 00:49:48.279
I'll do it again.

715
00:49:50.824 --> 00:49:53.034
And I bet you'll
make it stick this time.

716
00:49:53.118 --> 00:49:55.662
I regret I ever felt that way.

717
00:49:55.745 --> 00:49:57.831
But an upper hand
is an upper hand.

718
00:49:57.914 --> 00:50:00.041
But Brandon's alive.
I heard you.

719
00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:04.170
Well. I wouldn't
say alive exactly.

720
00:50:04.254 --> 00:50:06.798
I also wouldn't say all
the way dead either.

721
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:09.384
Then he'll come for me.

722
00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:10.802
If he's alive.
he'll look for me.

723
00:50:10.885 --> 00:50:12.178
I'm counting on it.

724
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:15.807
What do you mean?

725
00:50:20.729 --> 00:50:22.147
There's a cathedral
in Woodsboro.

726
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:23.523
It's perfect.

727
00:50:23.606 --> 00:50:25.525
Woodsboro's like
four hours from here.

728
00:50:25.608 --> 00:50:28.236
Oh. yeah. real out of the way.

729
00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:30.280
It's a haul. so it will
eat up his time.

730
00:50:30.363 --> 00:50:32.949
Speaking of which.
stash her in my trunk.

731
00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:33.950
We're leaving.

732
00:50:34.034 --> 00:50:35.410
What if he doesn't show?

733
00:50:35.493 --> 00:50:37.245
He'll show.

734
00:51:58.785 --> 00:52:00.286
Where's Sofia?

735
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:03.081
Dinner table!
Boss left you a note.

736
00:52:19.055 --> 00:52:20.306
[motorcycle engine roars]

737
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:25.372
Rise and shine. Sofia!

738
00:53:28.458 --> 00:53:29.709
Nice night. isn't it?

739
00:53:33.129 --> 00:53:34.297
What are we doing out here?

740
00:53:37.509 --> 00:53:40.428
Waiting for your one true love.

741
00:53:40.512 --> 00:53:41.680
What else?

742
00:53:42.764 --> 00:53:44.224
He's coming here?

743
00:53:44.307 --> 00:53:47.227
If he wants you back. yes.

744
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:51.481
And when he does.
we're ready for him.

745
00:53:51.564 --> 00:53:56.444
But no job is too immense
when you have confidence.

746
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.837
What happened to us?

747
00:54:17.007 --> 00:54:19.426
You were into me
once. right?

748
00:54:20.802 --> 00:54:24.139
Think we could give
it another go?

749
00:54:28.393 --> 00:54:32.647
I am very forgiving
for the most part.

750
00:54:37.068 --> 00:54:38.903
I get it!
I tried to kill you!

751
00:54:38.987 --> 00:54:40.447
Fair point.

752
00:54:42.449 --> 00:54:44.242
Jessica Lewis happened to us.

753
00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:49.998
Who's that?

754
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.793
She was my best friend.

755
00:54:56.087 --> 00:54:58.590
She got hooked.

756
00:54:58.673 --> 00:55:02.260
Someone sold her bad shit
and she died.

757
00:55:04.012 --> 00:55:05.472
She was 17!

758
00:55:08.767 --> 00:55:12.687
Then I found out it was you
that sold her that shit!

759
00:55:14.356 --> 00:55:16.691
I despised you.

760
00:55:16.775 --> 00:55:17.817
I wanted you dead.

761
00:55:19.819 --> 00:55:21.488
I wanted me dead.

762
00:55:23.365 --> 00:55:25.700
Maybe I could have saved her.

763
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:41.925
For what it's worth.
I am human.

764
00:55:45.887 --> 00:55:48.056
I loved you and you hurt me.

765
00:55:52.018 --> 00:55:55.230
I wouldn't have gone through all
this trouble if I wasn't hurt.

766
00:56:00.694 --> 00:56:03.530
Naturally. I'm bitter.
so I guess we're even.

767
00:56:04.948 --> 00:56:06.074
[spits]

768
00:56:13.289 --> 00:56:16.835
If that's the best you got.
then I pity you.

769
00:56:16.918 --> 00:56:20.338
-You're evil!
-It helps!

770
00:56:20.422 --> 00:56:22.924
I wasn't bluffing!

771
00:56:23.008 --> 00:56:25.385
I'll kill myself before you
send me anywhere!

772
00:56:29.514 --> 00:56:34.686
Hm. well. that would be
an utterly shocking waste.

773
00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:40.859
Luckily. we traffic in
cadavers for medical schools

774
00:56:40.942 --> 00:56:43.236
that don't ask questions.

775
00:56:47.991 --> 00:56:52.203
Now. sit back and relax.

776
00:56:52.287 --> 00:56:54.205
His time's almost up.

777
00:56:55.915 --> 00:56:57.417
His time for what?

778
00:57:28.698 --> 00:57:31.034
Time's almost up. Brandon.

779
00:57:31.117 --> 00:57:32.827
I figured you'd show up.

780
00:57:32.911 --> 00:57:35.163
You don't think
I'd miss the grand finale?

781
00:57:35.246 --> 00:57:37.749
You do know this is a trap?

782
00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:40.669
Figured they'd play dirty.

783
00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:42.837
Yeah. well. there's
a lot about all this

784
00:57:42.921 --> 00:57:45.048
that isn't exactly kosher.

785
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:48.385
What happens to Sofia
when I'm gone?

786
00:57:48.468 --> 00:57:51.179
Well. if you clear the deck
as in all the guys

787
00:57:51.262 --> 00:57:53.264
that wanna pack her off
to Mexico.

788
00:57:53.348 --> 00:57:55.141
I suppose she gets
on with her life.

789
00:57:55.225 --> 00:57:57.727
grows old and dies
happy and fulfilled.

790
00:58:00.814 --> 00:58:02.107
Good enough.

791
00:58:03.942 --> 00:58:05.068
See you soon. kid.

792
00:58:07.779 --> 00:58:09.698
They're around the back.
Waiting for you.

793
00:58:21.793 --> 00:58:25.213
Hey! There he is!

794
00:58:25.296 --> 00:58:28.341
This guy damned his soul
for you. you know?

795
00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:30.260
Oh my God. Brandon!

796
00:58:30.343 --> 00:58:31.803
Not God.

797
00:58:31.886 --> 00:58:33.138
Not exactly.

798
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:35.765
You okay?
Did he hurt you?

799
00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:36.891
Are you okay?

800
00:58:38.643 --> 00:58:41.813
That's far enough. lover boy.

801
00:58:41.896 --> 00:58:43.690
Was it all worth it. Angel?

802
00:58:45.358 --> 00:58:47.527
I mean. wouldn't
you say she's worth it?

803
00:58:48.903 --> 00:58:51.114
I mean. you did sell
your damn soul

804
00:58:51.197 --> 00:58:53.825
to the devil for her. right?

805
00:58:53.908 --> 00:58:55.702
Too many people have died.

806
00:58:55.785 --> 00:58:58.997
Just let her go. please. okay?

807
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.499
Give me your word
she'll be safe. I'll back off.

808
00:59:03.918 --> 00:59:05.253
I don't believe you.

809
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.006
You have my word.

810
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:09.507
You're gonna have to trust me.

811
00:59:09.591 --> 00:59:12.135
Hm. and if I do that.

812
00:59:12.218 --> 00:59:14.512
if I let her go right now

813
00:59:14.596 --> 00:59:19.934
and you go back to wherever
it is you're going to.

814
00:59:20.018 --> 00:59:24.189
how can you trust me
to keep my promise

815
00:59:24.272 --> 00:59:25.982
that I won't go after her again?

816
00:59:27.108 --> 00:59:29.402
Just gonna have to trust you.

817
00:59:29.486 --> 00:59:32.155
Saying that out loud. it doesn't
seem like a good idea.

818
00:59:36.034 --> 00:59:38.953
No. it's a brilliant idea.
Let's try it.

819
00:59:39.037 --> 00:59:41.623
What happened to you?

820
00:59:41.706 --> 00:59:43.166
I don't know where to begin.

821
00:59:45.085 --> 00:59:47.796
Are you... dead?

822
00:59:50.715 --> 00:59:52.884
Did you really do
what he says you did?

823
00:59:57.514 --> 00:59:58.973
Why did you do that?

824
00:59:59.057 --> 01:00:00.767
-Sofia...
-It should be obvious.

825
01:00:01.976 --> 01:00:03.478
I don't have time for this.

826
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.607
Ah!

827
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:11.403
[Angel laughs]

828
01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:13.530
Oh. what's the matter?

829
01:00:13.613 --> 01:00:15.115
Did that hurt?

830
01:00:15.198 --> 01:00:16.449
What is this?

831
01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:19.077
I mean. don't you get it?

832
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.831
Instant holy ground!

833
01:00:22.914 --> 01:00:26.918
Just add holy water.

834
01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:29.587
No trespassing for you.

835
01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:35.677
Pretty good. huh?

836
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:40.682
Must really burn you up to be
so close. yet so far. far away.

837
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.477
No. no. no. no!
You're staying with me.

838
01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:50.066
You wouldn't shoot me.
not after all this.

839
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.818
I mean. I would.

840
01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:54.738
I'm unpredictable.

841
01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:06.750
Oh. my God. Bran!

842
01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:08.460
Fleck!

843
01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:18.970
The devil itself!

844
01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:21.639
Do it!

845
01:01:21.723 --> 01:01:22.974
Yes.

846
01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:26.019
What do you think you're doing?

847
01:01:26.102 --> 01:01:27.520
Hurry up. Father!
Splash him!

848
01:01:27.604 --> 01:01:31.274
In the name of the Father
and of the Son...

849
01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:33.985
-No! Stop!
-Quiet!

850
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:35.653
It's just getting good!

851
01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:41.576
And the Holy Spirit. I command
you to leave this man!

852
01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:45.330
Whoa. holy water is no joke!

853
01:01:47.832 --> 01:01:50.710
Dear God. merciful God!

854
01:01:56.174 --> 01:01:57.092
Brandon?

855
01:01:58.176 --> 01:02:00.261
You're a monster!

856
01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:02.430
Me? Look at him!

857
01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:05.600
He's got a burning
pumpkin head!

858
01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:07.727
I'm the normal one here!

859
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.187
Brandon. can you hear me?

860
01:02:11.523 --> 01:02:14.901
I'm sorry. Sofia.

861
01:02:14.984 --> 01:02:16.444
Look. I don't know
when you made

862
01:02:16.528 --> 01:02:18.321
this little super
powered agreement.

863
01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:22.158
but I'm guessing
time's almost up for you.

864
01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:23.952
Jesus. Angel.
Just let me go.

865
01:02:24.035 --> 01:02:25.704
You don't have to
do any of this!

866
01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:27.914
What? No.

867
01:02:27.997 --> 01:02:29.332
Angel!

868
01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:37.549
I'm not finished yet!

869
01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:41.511
Famous last words!

870
01:02:41.594 --> 01:02:44.723
In case you haven't
noticed. it's over.

871
01:02:44.806 --> 01:02:46.057
I win.

872
01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:48.727
[rumbling]

873
01:02:51.438 --> 01:02:53.565
Whoa!

874
01:02:53.648 --> 01:02:55.608
Sounds like that's for you.

875
01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:03.158
Brandon!

876
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:04.826
Time's up. friend.

877
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:14.794
Brandon!
What's happening?

878
01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:20.633
I love you.

879
01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:22.594
I love you. Brandon.

880
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:29.017
Take these.

881
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.685
She won't have need for those.

882
01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:33.855
I'll love you forever.

883
01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:39.069
[screams]

884
01:03:39.152 --> 01:03:42.906
No!

885
01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:44.824
Brandon!

886
01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:48.203
No! No!

887
01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:49.204
[cackling]

888
01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.415
You don't see that every day.

889
01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:56.419
Fleck. did you see that?

890
01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.129
Oh. I saw it.

891
01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:04.636
Merciful God...

892
01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:08.431
Oh. what's the matter?

893
01:04:08.515 --> 01:04:11.226
You never seen an ex-boyfriend
dragged back to hell before?

894
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:12.435
Get away from me!

895
01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:14.312
Cheer up.

896
01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:17.315
You two would have
never lasted anyway.

897
01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:30.453
Father. thank you for your help.

898
01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:35.375
He... he was possessed.

899
01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:39.713
Yeah. something like that.

900
01:04:39.796 --> 01:04:43.675
Don't look so surprised. Father.

901
01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:47.345
Don't they prepare you guys
for stuff like this?

902
01:04:47.429 --> 01:04:49.180
I'd imagine it's Priest 101.

903
01:04:56.604 --> 01:05:01.276
I... I have to report this
to the Monsignor.

904
01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:06.781
He... He has to know about
this immediately.

905
01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:11.536
No. no. mum's the word.

906
01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:12.912
You understand?

907
01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:18.960
This needs to stay between us.

908
01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:21.546
Seal of the confessional
and all that.

909
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:29.929
You have to understand

910
01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:34.100
what I just witnessed
doesn't happen too often.

911
01:05:34.184 --> 01:05:37.604
Frankly. I've never
heard of anyone

912
01:05:37.687 --> 01:05:40.190
who's seen anything
remotely like this.

913
01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:43.568
It's... It's huge.

914
01:05:43.651 --> 01:05:47.572
It's a big deal. I know.
I understand.

915
01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:48.740
It's immense!

916
01:05:50.658 --> 01:05:52.369
It's unfathomable.

917
01:05:54.621 --> 01:05:56.456
Do you know what this
could mean for the church?

918
01:05:56.539 --> 01:05:59.459
Father. do you know
what this could mean

919
01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:02.462
if I get connected
to something like this?

920
01:06:06.091 --> 01:06:08.134
Uh. I'd...

921
01:06:08.218 --> 01:06:10.053
I'd keep your
name out of this.

922
01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:14.224
I'd keep my mouth shut
about your involvement

923
01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:17.060
and your associate's
involvement. too.

924
01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:24.943
Yeah. Well. you see. it
is important. nay imperative

925
01:06:25.026 --> 01:06:29.030
that you keep your
mouth shut about all of this.

926
01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:30.407
Can you do that?

927
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:32.409
Look. Mr. Cregar...

928
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:38.248
Like I keep saying...

929
01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:39.374
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I get it.

930
01:06:42.919 --> 01:06:44.087
No.

931
01:06:52.762 --> 01:06:54.389
We got a problem.

932
01:06:54.472 --> 01:06:55.598
What are you talking about?

933
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.853
You gotta be kidding me!
You weren't watching her!

934
01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:03.148
She was tied up.
I'm one guy!

935
01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:04.607
I had to back you up
with the priest!

936
01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:06.901
Did it look like I needed
backup with the priest?

937
01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:07.902
Well. you never know!

938
01:07:13.074 --> 01:07:13.992
I'll find her!

939
01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:15.618
I know where she went.

940
01:07:15.702 --> 01:07:16.953
Where?

941
01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:21.041
To where it all began.

942
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.417
The bridge?

943
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.918
Because there's no way...

944
01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:25.628
Gather the boys!

945
01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:29.966
The ones that are alive. double
their pay if they survive.

946
01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:32.969
And toss the priest.

947
01:08:35.156 --> 01:08:37.659
Are you here?

948
01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:39.411
I wanna make a deal
just like Brandon!

949
01:08:41.496 --> 01:08:44.124
Please. if you're there. I'm
willing to give all that I have!

950
01:08:48.586 --> 01:08:51.339
Please! Please!

951
01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.551
Please. are you there?

952
01:08:59.514 --> 01:09:01.599
Why so sad?

953
01:09:01.683 --> 01:09:03.560
He gave his life for me.

954
01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:06.604
Now I wanna do the same.

955
01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:10.108
Love makes humans fools.

956
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:11.526
I do love him.

957
01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.653
He doesn't deserve to
die like that.

958
01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:16.322
And you do?

959
01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:18.116
Make no mistake. young lady.

960
01:09:18.199 --> 01:09:21.953
That is what you're asking me.
or am I mistaken?

961
01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:23.538
You're not.

962
01:09:25.123 --> 01:09:27.625
I see what Brandon sees in you.

963
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:29.169
You wear guts well.

964
01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:32.964
You're...

965
01:09:33.048 --> 01:09:35.842
Oh. yeah.
You can feel it.

966
01:09:35.925 --> 01:09:37.344
I know you can feel it.

967
01:09:41.306 --> 01:09:45.435
But you mentioned something
about giving your life.

968
01:09:45.518 --> 01:09:47.437
A trade.

969
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.189
A trade?

970
01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:51.900
You know. I don't normally
like to trade.

971
01:09:51.983 --> 01:09:56.071
But exchanging his soul
for your ivory pure one.

972
01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:58.198
that would be a
bargain. wouldn't it?

973
01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:01.284
The men that took me...

974
01:10:01.368 --> 01:10:04.287
They're still alive. I know.

975
01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:07.040
And they're coming here now.

976
01:10:07.123 --> 01:10:09.042
They were promised to me.

977
01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:11.920
You'll have them.

978
01:10:12.003 --> 01:10:13.588
You'll deliver them?

979
01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:19.886
Now I know why
Brandon loves you.

980
01:10:23.014 --> 01:10:27.394
But once the coast is clear.
you're staying with me.

981
01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:30.689
No ifs. ands or buts about it.

982
01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:32.816
You understand the terms
of the agreement?

983
01:10:34.901 --> 01:10:37.404
Yes.

984
01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:40.657
On the condition that he returns
with no obligation to you.

985
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.033
Promise.

986
01:10:43.118 --> 01:10:44.494
You accept my gift?

987
01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:46.621
Your gift?

988
01:10:57.507 --> 01:10:58.883
I accept.

989
01:11:07.308 --> 01:11:08.727
Why would she come back here?

990
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:10.353
It's where I would go.

991
01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:11.980
I think she went to the cops.

992
01:11:12.063 --> 01:11:14.149
This is beyond cops. Fleck.

993
01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:16.860
She could be anywhere.

994
01:11:16.943 --> 01:11:19.070
No. She's on that bridge.

995
01:11:20.739 --> 01:11:21.781
Listen up!

996
01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:23.700
Get the girl and
take her alive.

997
01:11:23.783 --> 01:11:27.037
She's merchandise.
so treat her nice.

998
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.081
No rough stuff...

999
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.666
unless you have
to be convincing.

1000
01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:36.713
Vamonos!

1001
01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:51.686
Hey!

1002
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:52.729
Where'd you go?

1003
01:11:55.982 --> 01:11:57.192
Sofia?

1004
01:11:59.069 --> 01:12:01.196
Oh. my God!
You're back!

1005
01:12:05.116 --> 01:12:06.493
Where am I?

1006
01:12:08.244 --> 01:12:09.371
Did we win?

1007
01:12:11.956 --> 01:12:14.542
What does that mean?

1008
01:12:14.626 --> 01:12:15.794
I brought you back.

1009
01:12:15.877 --> 01:12:18.588
You brought me back?

1010
01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:20.131
Wait...
Wait. wait.

1011
01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:22.258
We're back on the bridge.

1012
01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.386
What did you do?

1013
01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:25.804
What I had to.

1014
01:12:27.263 --> 01:12:28.765
No. you shouldn't
have done that!

1015
01:12:28.848 --> 01:12:30.266
What else was
I supposed to do?

1016
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:32.185
When I said I'd love
you forever. I meant it.

1017
01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:33.186
Same.

1018
01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.315
Look. this is all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

1019
01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:40.777
You did nothing wrong.
okay. except talking to him.

1020
01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:44.364
I had no other choice.

1021
01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:47.742
Angel and his guys are
on their way here right now.

1022
01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:49.160
But they don't know
what's coming for them.

1023
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.957
Now how do I work this thing
so I can kick their ass?

1024
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.542
At this point. I think
we should just kill her.

1025
01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:57.669
She's become
too much of a problem.

1026
01:12:57.752 --> 01:13:00.046
You guys go on up ahead.

1027
01:13:02.882 --> 01:13:04.175
What's the matter?

1028
01:13:04.259 --> 01:13:07.053
You want us to go first?

1029
01:13:07.137 --> 01:13:10.557
Oh. I could hold your
hand if you're scared.

1030
01:13:32.954 --> 01:13:34.831
So who'd you say
we were looking for?

1031
01:13:34.914 --> 01:13:36.499
Sofia.

1032
01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.917
Well. she ain't here.

1033
01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:48.803
Uh. okay.

1034
01:14:11.826 --> 01:14:13.536
Screw this!

1035
01:14:19.459 --> 01:14:20.543
Fine.

1036
01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:23.838
Keep it.
Consider it a gift.

1037
01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:28.093
Let me be the first
to apologize.

1038
01:14:28.176 --> 01:14:32.389
I know things went too far
and for that. I'm sorry.

1039
01:14:34.349 --> 01:14:35.558
Too late.

1040
01:14:51.157 --> 01:14:54.577
Get up... slowly.

1041
01:15:00.291 --> 01:15:03.586
No metal hand tells me bullets
might mean more to you now.

1042
01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:08.591
Walk in front of me.
Don't be stupid.

1043
01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:12.303
You run. I shoot.

1044
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.146
Please!

1045
01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:25.316
You don't want me.

1046
01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.317
Let's make a deal.

1047
01:15:29.404 --> 01:15:31.698
I get you Angel.

1048
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:35.410
And in exchange.
you let me walk outta here.

1049
01:15:38.538 --> 01:15:40.582
-What are you doing?
-Squashing a flea.

1050
01:15:40.665 --> 01:15:42.417
No. No!

1051
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.627
I don't deserve this!

1052
01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:45.837
Please!

1053
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.963
[neck cracks]

1054
01:15:50.425 --> 01:15:51.343
He snuck up on me.

1055
01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:52.594
Let him go!

1056
01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:55.722
I mean. I'm not gonna do that.

1057
01:15:55.805 --> 01:15:58.391
You keep making
the wrong choices.

1058
01:15:58.475 --> 01:15:59.642
You know you're
gonna die. right?

1059
01:15:59.726 --> 01:16:01.978
I've accepted that outcome.

1060
01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:05.565
It was all supposed
to be so simple!

1061
01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:08.068
Don't do it!

1062
01:16:08.151 --> 01:16:10.945
You know what they say.

1063
01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:13.365
If you can't beat 'em.
take 'em with you.

1064
01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:14.574
Ah!

1065
01:16:27.837 --> 01:16:28.755
[grunts]

1066
01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:34.386
You broke my heart.

1067
01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:35.762
Get over it!

1068
01:16:44.521 --> 01:16:46.439
Not bad!

1069
01:16:47.899 --> 01:16:49.275
Had a good teacher.

1070
01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:50.985
You're right about this thing.

1071
01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:51.986
MVP of the night.

1072
01:16:54.447 --> 01:16:55.657
No!

1073
01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.411
In a way...
I... still... win.

1074
01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:08.586
Sofia?

1075
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:12.465
It's okay. I'm okay.

1076
01:17:12.549 --> 01:17:14.259
I've been through
this a few times.

1077
01:17:14.342 --> 01:17:16.594
Hurts like hell. right?

1078
01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:19.305
Don't worry.
You'll bounce right back up.

1079
01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:22.100
But you'll need to feed. right?

1080
01:17:22.183 --> 01:17:23.810
You won't want to.
but you'll need to.

1081
01:17:23.893 --> 01:17:24.936
It hurts!

1082
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.063
I can get Angel and...

1083
01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:28.648
No.

1084
01:17:28.732 --> 01:17:29.858
Stay with me.

1085
01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:33.028
Be with me.

1086
01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:34.946
Hold my hand.

1087
01:17:41.202 --> 01:17:42.954
Could you love me forever?

1088
01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:50.628
And ever.

1089
01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:57.635
You weren't dead.

1090
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:01.097
What did you promise
him to bring me back?

1091
01:18:06.686 --> 01:18:10.023
Oh. no. no. you didn't!

1092
01:18:10.106 --> 01:18:11.733
Brandon...

1093
01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:15.653
No! Don't take her!
She doesn't deserve this!

1094
01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:17.072
Bran. please...

1095
01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:18.490
Don't you take her from me!

1096
01:18:26.581 --> 01:18:28.333
I don't want you to go.

1097
01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:31.211
I'm so sorry.

1098
01:18:33.213 --> 01:18:34.631
It's okay.

1099
01:18:35.965 --> 01:18:36.925
You're worth it.

1100
01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:51.022
No!

1101
01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:53.108
No! Sofia. no!

1102
01:18:55.777 --> 01:18:57.696
How could you take her from me?

1103
01:18:57.779 --> 01:18:59.406
How could you?

1104
01:19:02.617 --> 01:19:06.329
Hey! I know you can hear me!

1105
01:19:06.413 --> 01:19:09.124
Bring her back!
Please don't do this!

1106
01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:10.625
She's gone.

1107
01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:18.133
Bring her back.

1108
01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:20.385
-A deal's a deal.
-It's not fair.

1109
01:19:20.468 --> 01:19:22.220
I'm always fair.

1110
01:19:22.303 --> 01:19:24.389
It was her choice.

1111
01:19:24.472 --> 01:19:26.683
She's gone. you're here.

1112
01:19:26.766 --> 01:19:28.393
Debts paid.

1113
01:19:28.476 --> 01:19:30.520
No. No. I can't accept that.

1114
01:19:30.603 --> 01:19:33.523
There must be
something I can do.

1115
01:19:33.606 --> 01:19:37.861
It's always possible. but don't
you think you've done enough?

1116
01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:41.573
Remember. she gave up her
life on your behalf.

1117
01:19:46.536 --> 01:19:48.413
Be a good man.

1118
01:19:48.496 --> 01:19:49.581
Live a good life.

1119
01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:52.751
Earn her sacrifice.

1120
01:19:52.834 --> 01:19:54.044
I wanna make a new deal.

1121
01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:58.381
Kid. listen.
Walk away.

1122
01:19:58.465 --> 01:20:00.050
Be selfish.

1123
01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:01.760
You know what you could do?

1124
01:20:01.843 --> 01:20:04.971
Dedicate a park bench in her
name. something like that.

1125
01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:06.222
Just be done with it.

1126
01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:08.391
I just want her back.

1127
01:20:08.475 --> 01:20:10.852
Doesn't work like that.

1128
01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:12.520
There's tit for tat.

1129
01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:15.982
I want. you want.
I get. you get.

1130
01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:17.859
I understand. okay?

1131
01:20:17.942 --> 01:20:18.902
There must be something
I can give.

1132
01:20:18.985 --> 01:20:24.282
I just want her back. Please.

1133
01:20:24.366 --> 01:20:28.244
I knew I was
right about you two.

1134
01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:30.080
What does that mean?

1135
01:20:30.163 --> 01:20:32.332
I knew if I got
Sofia under contract.

1136
01:20:32.415 --> 01:20:36.294
I wouldn't have both of you.

1137
01:20:36.378 --> 01:20:40.799
Now hold on. hold on.
I didn't pull anything tricky.

1138
01:20:40.882 --> 01:20:42.425
She came calling.

1139
01:20:42.509 --> 01:20:44.844
You didn't have
to accept her deal.

1140
01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:47.681
Why wouldn't I?

1141
01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:49.432
Okay. let's fix it!

1142
01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:53.228
Fix it?

1143
01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:55.522
All right. let me think.
let me think.

1144
01:20:55.605 --> 01:20:58.316
Now you proved that
you're a man of your word.

1145
01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.444
But you're used goods.

1146
01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:06.741
Your soul is filthy.
You're useless.

1147
01:21:06.825 --> 01:21:08.993
But I have worked with worse.

1148
01:21:09.077 --> 01:21:10.662
Sure. you have.

1149
01:21:10.745 --> 01:21:14.541
Well. every tool has its use.
no matter how rusted.

1150
01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:16.167
Name it!

1151
01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:17.460
If not my soul. then what?

1152
01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:21.256
Oh. no. no. no.
Your soul is included.

1153
01:21:21.339 --> 01:21:25.176
I just have to figure out how
to amend our original agreement.

1154
01:21:29.139 --> 01:21:32.976
Would you consider
killing again... for me?

1155
01:21:34.352 --> 01:21:35.937
I hated it.

1156
01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:40.734
Kid. it's for Sofia. the
girl who made you feel seen.

1157
01:21:40.817 --> 01:21:43.069
the girl who
completed you... Sofia.

1158
01:21:47.157 --> 01:21:49.617
For her. I would.

1159
01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.162
I have.

1160
01:21:53.663 --> 01:21:55.707
So. yes.

1161
01:22:01.046 --> 01:22:03.965
That's a beautiful thing. kid.

1162
01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:10.555
I get. you get.

1163
01:22:11.806 --> 01:22:13.516
In exchange for Sofia's life.

1164
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.894
Deal.

1165
01:22:15.977 --> 01:22:18.438
Now let's go
paint the town... red.

1166
01:22:18.521 --> 01:22:20.732
[laughs]
