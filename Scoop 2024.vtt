00:13:08.416 --> 00:13:10.083
[guests clapping]

177
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:18.041
Maybe for the best no one came.

178
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.333
[Andrew] Ah. there we are.

179
00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:26.416
All right. now say Pitch@Palace.

180
00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:28.333
[all] Pitch@Palace!

181
00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:30.750
Pitch@Palace!

182
00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:34.666
Uh... I'd like it to be <i>fair.</i>

183
00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:37.083
I mean. you don't mention Epstein

184
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.833
every time there's a story
about Bill Clinton. do you?

185
00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:42.375
[man] <i>Bill Clinton
isn't the Queen's favorite son.</i>

186
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:46.541
[sighs] And if you had been here.
then you would have seen for yourself

187
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:50.375
the... the wonderful job that...
that he does with Pitch.

188
00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:52.791
encouraging young entrepreneurs.

189
00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:55.750
<i>How young? These entrepreneurs?
How young is young?</i>

190
00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:58.750
Piss off. Nick.

191
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.416
How do they get away with this?

192
00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:08.875
That is why we have hired Jason.
To manage this.

193
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.125
Time.

194
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:15.916
- It takes time.
- Time? That photograph is nine years old.

195
00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.083
- Sir. just--
- No.

196
00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:25.541
- No quick fix to a story like this.
- So you people keep telling me.

197
00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:29.708
[Jason] <i>And you are 100% right.</i>

198
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.208
Your Royal Highness.

199
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:34.458
About what?

200
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:39.833
You've been dealing with
this Epstein mess for nearly a decade.

201
00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:42.916
You haven't seen him
in that time. correct?

202
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.333
Uh... No. No. um...

203
00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:46.833
No. absolutely. It was. um...

204
00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:50.250
Uh... December 2010.

205
00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:55.166
Then my instinct is...
you haven't had the right strategy.

206
00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:58.750
Epstein. and the whole...
Playboy Prince thing.

207
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.125
should have been put to bed
a long time ago.

208
00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:04.166
And I can make it go away.

209
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:07.416
But you have to let me control it.

210
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.083
Amanda?

211
00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:15.458
Well. uh. Jason knows the press.

212
00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:16.958
That's why we hired him.

213
00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.000
Uh...

214
00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.500
I think he can help us.

215
00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:30.583
I've. uh. put together
a list of friendly journalists.

216
00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:32.958
That's a... contradiction in terms. innit?

217
00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:37.041
Invite them here. one by one. for tea.

218
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.583
They feel special.

219
00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:42.416
You get to know each other.
all off the record.

220
00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:45.750
and slowly they realize
you're a decent human being.

221
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.583
who is. by the way.

222
00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:50.250
prepared to acknowledge
errors of judgment.

223
00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:52.916
[grunts]

224
00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:54.833
Slowly.

225
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.333
It's always slowly. Always time.

226
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:00.833
I'm 60 next year.

227
00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.583
And my mother. well...

228
00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.375
none of us are getting any younger.

229
00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:29.458
Jason's list of journalists.

230
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.666
[inhales deeply]

231
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.000
Mm...

232
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.958
What?

233
00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:38.500
[sighs] Well. this...

234
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:42.083
This list. This... strategy.

235
00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:44.916
We've been down this road before.

236
00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:01.375
["Don't Rain On My Parade"
plays as ringtone]

237
00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.500
- Hello?
- [Amanda] <i>Hello. Sam.</i>

238
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.625
<i>It's Amanda Thirsk
from the Duke of York's office.</i>

239
00:17:10.625 --> 00:17:11.541
Hi.

240
00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:13.916
But we don't do red lines.

241
00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:16.208
No questions off the table.

242
00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:19.291
- Maybe just think on it.
- <i>I'll get back to you.</i>

243
00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:21.208
Great. Speak soon.

244
00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:26.291
- [woman] Anything good?
- Not sure. The Palace.

245
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.583
- Right. what have we got?
- You know what I think?

246
00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.458
For intelligent analysis.
we're the only place in town.

247
00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:34.375
Brexit again.

248
00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:37.375
Sam. didn't you have something?
The Palace?

249
00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:39.708
Uh. not for tonight. But we have Lupita.

250
00:17:39.708 --> 00:17:41.750
Great. Which bit of the Palace?

251
00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:45.833
- Prince Andrew's private secretary.
- Okay. what do they want?

252
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.625
Pitch@Palace. It's like <i>The Apprentice.</i>

253
00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:51.875
only you get Prince Andrew
instead of Donald Trump.

254
00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:54.291
- It's not on television--
- Not <i>Newsnight</i>. is it?

255
00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:55.416
Do you know Andrew's PS?

256
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.541
- No.
- Did she reach out to you first?

257
00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:01.125
[Sam] Yeah.

258
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.166
Yeah.

259
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.041
Okay. everyone. keep looking.
and let's talk again in an hour.

260
00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:11.041
[pensive music plays]

261
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:36.666
[Sam] I need a connect.

262
00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:40.666
Uh. Jae Donnelly. A pap.
Based in New York. Do you know him?

263
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:44.583
Great.

264
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.125
God... For Christ's sake.

265
00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:51.166
Farage isn't available.
We need somebody else.

266
00:18:51.166 --> 00:18:53.875
Maybe even he's bored with it by now.
Give me a minute.

267
00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:55.500
- Who's on the phone?
- Photographer.

268
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.791
Working for who? Paparazzi?

269
00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:00.958
All your favorites. Freddy.
<i>The Sun</i>. <i>The Mail</i>.

270
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.125
For Christ's sake.

271
00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:04.291
[Sam] You know what?
If we had half the instincts

272
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:07.666
and a quarter of the contacts
for the average tabloid pap.

273
00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:09.708
maybe we wouldn't be scrabbling around

274
00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:12.541
for new ways to have
the same argument every night.

275
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:15.125
So just. you know. leave it with me. yeah?

276
00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:16.416
Coming right up.

277
00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:19.958
Someone... Someone
for Emily to really tell off.

278
00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.166
- All the dinner parties in North London...
- Sam.

279
00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:26.333
- ...say. "Did you see <i>Newsnight</i> last night?
- Sam.

280
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:31.458
"Wasn't it amazing how Emily Maitlis said
all the great things we all agree with?"

281
00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:36.333
We're mistaking talking to ourselves
for news. Freddy. and it's killing us.

282
00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:37.625
[inhales deeply]

283
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:44.541
- Stewart.
- Mm?

284
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:46.250
I'm heading down to the studio.

285
00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:50.500
[pensive music plays]

286
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:54.416
- Come! Moody!
- [dog whimpers]

287
00:19:57.041 --> 00:20:01.125
I behave like that... insulting people
in front of the entire office.

288
00:20:02.416 --> 00:20:04.750
I mean. am I still here?
Do I still have a job?

289
00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:18.416
We have an issue

290
00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:20.416
with Sam.

291
00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.208
We? Who's we?

292
00:20:22.208 --> 00:20:24.750
[scoffs] Well. I do.

293
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.416
Freddy. and now possibly Emily.

294
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.458
I'm not a snob. but she's very <i>Daily Mail</i>.

295
00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:33.166
I'm not saying
we can't cope with different opinions.

296
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.208
but she is...

297
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:36.958
she's too defensive.

298
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:46.708
[woman] Put the lights up a touch.

299
00:20:47.708 --> 00:20:49.000
It's too cold.

300
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.333
I didn't say "turn back down."

301
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:55.416
[tech] Sure. but this is
the correct set level for broadcast.

302
00:20:55.416 --> 00:20:57.458
I'm aware of that. Back up.

303
00:20:58.041 --> 00:20:59.375
Thanks for coming. Sam.

304
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:01.875
That level but warmer.

305
00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:03.416
[tech] All right. okay.

306
00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:05.541
I'll just have to switch
some things around.

307
00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:09.375
You understand the pressure we're under?

308
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:12.041
All of us.
I've got enough fights on my hands

309
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:13.750
without having them in my own team.

310
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.166
Maybe you should speak with--

311
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:18.958
I am speaking to them. and I'm saying
to them the same thing I'm saying to you.

312
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:22.375
- Help me out.
- What about something like that?

313
00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:24.458
Warmer. much warmer.

314
00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:28.416
I'm trying to make changes.
I want a broader audience.

315
00:21:28.416 --> 00:21:32.000
That's how we survive.
I've no interest in echo chambers.

316
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.416
I want different voices. I want tension.

317
00:21:34.416 --> 00:21:35.583
And passion.

318
00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:43.958
- Look. Emily. I'm sorry.
- No. you're not.

319
00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:46.666
You meant every word.

320
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.541
Not every word.

321
00:21:49.166 --> 00:21:51.583
Don't think I don't know
what people think about me.

322
00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:53.958
The point is.
if we're at each other's throats.

323
00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.833
then none of this is going to work.

324
00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:58.333
[tech] So what are we saying?

325
00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.166
No. warmer.

326
00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:02.083
Okay. stop there.

327
00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.500
- I like it.
- [tech] Great.

328
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.333
Okay. understood. Anything else?

329
00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:10.166
- I--
- [Emily] Three women and a whippet.

330
00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:13.625
You wouldn't have seen that
in a BBC studio when I started.

331
00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.166
[woman laughs]

332
00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:29.375
- [girl] Oh my God. n--
- Oh my God. that is--

333
00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:31.541
- No. no. no. no. no!
- No. no. no. no!

334
00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:34.375
- [exclaiming]
- I told you!

335
00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:36.458
[overlapping excited chatter]

336
00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:37.958
[musical ringtone playing]

337
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:38.916
Oh.

338
00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:45.750
<i>Sorry about the noise. I'm working.
I might have to go without saying goodbye.</i>

339
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.375
Thanks for calling me back. Anything good?

an apartment block on 66th Street</i>

348

<i>owned by Epstein's brother.
rented by Jeffrey.</i>

349
00:23:22.166 --> 00:23:25.791
<i>It's a warehouse of girls.</i>

350
00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:28.541
<i>He calls them his "nubiles."</i>

351
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:29.458
[scoffs]

352
00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:31.250
This is still happening?

353
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.416
<i>It's industrial. Sam.</i>

354
00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:35.708
I've been in New York for years.

355
00:23:35.708 --> 00:23:39.166
All I have to do is spend
24 hours outside of that place.

356
00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:40.750
and you see them come and go.

357
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.458
How do we not know about this?

358
00:23:42.458 --> 00:23:44.791
<i>Because it's young girls
no one cares about</i>

359
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:46.333
<i>going in and out of a house.</i>

360
00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:48.375
And he's rich.

361
00:23:49.541 --> 00:23:53.375
You know. he went to jail. Now he's out.
Frankly. hardly anyone gives a shit.

362
00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:56.541
And Andrew. is he in there often?

363
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:58.791
<i>- Oh. back in the day. sure.</i>
- Any proof?

364
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.083
<i>Of Andrew actually at Epstein's?</i>

365
00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.833
<i>Other than the park picture?</i>

366
00:24:02.833 --> 00:24:04.041
Uh... no.

367
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:06.083
No. they're careful.

368
00:24:07.375 --> 00:24:09.083
<i>But I can promise you he was there.</i>

369
00:24:09.583 --> 00:24:12.250
- You know about Ghislaine Maxwell. right?
- [clamoring]

370
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.166
- Andrew's friend?
- <i>No.</i>

371
00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:17.666
Well. you should. I've gotta go.
Ghislaine. Look her up. I'll be in touch.

372
00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:18.625
Thanks.

373
00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:26.875
- [girl 1] Guys.
- [girl 2] What?

374
00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:29.291
- [girl 1] Look at this.
- [girl 3] Let me see.

375

- A what?
- [softly] Writing a poem.

380
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.083
Lucas?

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.750
[horns honking]

382
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
[woman speaking indistinctly on TV]

383
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.083
So who is she?

384
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.333
I'm not in her class.

385
00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:35.083
Listen. I... I know I'm your mum.
and I'm biased and everything.

386
00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:37.958
but you're very handsome.
so you shouldn't--

387
00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:40.791
No. Oh my. I mean my actual class.

388
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:42.875
- She's in the year above.
- Oh.

389
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.875
Well. I like your ambition. [laughs]

390
00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:47.500
- [man] Chili sauce. yeah? The usual?
- Yes. please.

391
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:50.333
You want a tip? How to talk to girls?

392
00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:52.291
- Do I have a choice?
- Not really. no.

393
00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:54.833
You listen. Most people want to talk.

394
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:57.583
But most people are terrible at listening.

395
00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:58.583
Mm.

396
00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:01.041
[news jingle playing]

397
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:05.666
But you promised the British people
there wouldn't be an issue.

398
00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:07.916
{\an8}And at the time. I followed that through--

399
00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:10.291
{\an8}- Were you wrong at the time?
- I don't accept that.

400
00:26:10.291 --> 00:26:13.958
Well. you were either wrong
or making a promise you couldn't keep.

401
00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:14.875
<i>Which is it?</i>

402
00:26:15.916 --> 00:26:19.708
<i>You described yourself
as a man of principle.</i>

403
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:25.000
<i>You also guaranteed voters
that border checks between the UK and EU</i>

404
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.791

Hi. Jae. It's Sam.

and a girl. 17 at the time...

412
00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:26.875
Uh. 2001. Virginia Roberts.
Do you know anything about it?

413
00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:30.541
Um... Give me a call
when you get this. Thanks.

414

Bloody hell.

418
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:04.791
[chuckles] Okay. Okay.

<i>And a spoon.</i>

421
00:28:07.666 --> 00:28:09.083
Okay. bye.

422
00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:11.083
- [driver] Don't tell me.
- What?

423
00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:13.208
Is it Phil the Greek?

424
00:28:14.458 --> 00:28:15.500
Jugface?

425
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.625
I can't say.

426
00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:19.083
It can't be Her Majesty.
Her flag's not up.

427
00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:24.041
Well. just as long as
it's not that Randy fucking Andy.

428
00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:25.375
[chuckles]

429
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.208
Here we go.

[pensive music playing]

431
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:34.666
Whew!

432
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:36.416
Thanks.

[sighs]

434
00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:42.000
- Hello. Morning.
- Morning.

435
00:28:42.791 --> 00:28:43.625
Yeah.

436
00:28:44.708 --> 00:28:46.041
- Okay.
- Thank you.

437
00:28:48.208 --> 00:28:50.291
Follow the path.
They'll let you in at the top.

438
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:51.666
Okay. great. Thanks.

[pensive music builds slowly]

440
00:29:12.875 --> 00:29:14.125
[man] Good afternoon.

441
00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:46.791
[Amanda] Earl Grey or chamomile?

442
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:48.125
[chuckles. sighs]

443
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.333
[Amanda] We lose a fair few.

444
00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:56.750
- Teaspoons.
- [both chuckle]

445
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.041
They just seem to

446
00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.250
go.

447
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:04.125
It's seen as a good thing.

448
00:30:04.125 --> 00:30:07.583
- It means everybody wants a part of us.
- Us?

449
00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:11.583
[inhales] Well.
I've been here for a long time.

450
00:30:11.583 --> 00:30:16.500
It's like family. The day we don't need
to budget for extra teaspoons...

451
00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:20.041
And... would he be
prepared to talk about that?

452
00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:24.291
The theft of teaspoons
from Buckingham Palace?

453
00:30:24.291 --> 00:30:28.375
The future of the monarchy.
What it will mean when the Queen dies.

454
00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:31.166
[quietly] We don't talk about that.

455
00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:34.000
Too painful? For a favorite son?

456
00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:37.708
[inhales sharply. exhales]

457
00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:40.000
One thing about Her Majesty.

458
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.500
she is a very good judge of character.

459
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:46.291
Mm.

460
00:30:47.916 --> 00:30:49.791
So... what's she like?

461
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:51.708
- Who?
- Emily.

462
00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:54.875
Oh. well. she runs... [chuckles]

463
00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:57.458
She swims. she interviews.

464
00:30:57.458 --> 00:31:00.625
Nobody's ever seen her eat.
She's Superwoman.

465
00:31:01.583 --> 00:31:04.125
- And the Bic.
- Harry Potter has his wand.

466
00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:06.458
Emily Maitlis has her Bic.

467
00:31:06.458 --> 00:31:07.750
[Amanda chuckles softly]

468
00:31:08.708 --> 00:31:11.875
And Andrew? How's his judge of character?

469
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:18.625
He's a... a very loyal friend.

470
00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:22.000
Too loyal for his own good sometimes.

471
00:31:23.416 --> 00:31:24.583
Ghislaine Maxwell.

472
00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:25.833
[elevator dings]

473
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:28.750
- She was a good friend. yes.
- Mm-hmm.

474
00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:33.166
Straight to the point.

475
00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.791
There was some small talk.

476
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:39.583
but we're both busy women.
and we both know why we're here. Amanda.

477
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:46.333
[whispers] Do you want
to get a real drink?

478
00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:47.333
[chuckles]

479
00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:49.416
- [elevator dings]
- [pensive music plays]

480
00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:53.541
Amanda?

481
00:31:58.833 --> 00:31:59.666
Amanda?

482
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.583
Uh... she's out.

483
00:32:02.083 --> 00:32:03.791
With Sam McAlister.

484
00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:07.166
Who?

485
00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:12.833
What do you think you know about me. Sam?

486
00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:14.708
[inhales deeply]

487
00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:16.833
I know you come from banking.

488
00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:18.708
A single mum.

489
00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:23.833
I know that you've been
doing this job for seven years.

490
00:32:23.833 --> 00:32:26.416
and you have a problem that won't go away.

491
00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.791
And I know that you're here

492
00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:31.791
and Jason Stein isn't.

493
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.833
So?

494
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:37.208
So maybe it's you
who wants to do things differently.

495
00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:40.833
Or we're just looking at options.

496
00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:44.000
- Or that.
- [both laugh]

497
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.125
- [phone buzzing]
- [Amanda] Oh...

498
00:32:46.125 --> 00:32:47.583
Uh...

499
00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:49.500
Sorry. it's Andrew. He needs me.

500
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.833
Um. I'm only trying
to be honest with you. Amanda.

501
00:32:52.833 --> 00:32:53.875
I always am.

502
00:32:53.875 --> 00:32:57.083
And you know it can't just be Pitch.

503
00:32:57.083 --> 00:33:02.000
And like I said before.
you wouldn't be here talking to <i>Newsnight</i>

504
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.916
if you didn't already know that.

505
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.541
[inhales sharply] But I'm not talking
to <i>Newsnight</i>. Sam.

506
00:33:08.208 --> 00:33:09.375
I'm talking to you.

507
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.916
And there <i>is</i> a red line.

508
00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:14.500
[melancholy music playing]

509
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.916
Thank you for meeting.

510
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.750
[Andrew] <i>You'll like this too.
This is moments</i>

511
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.625
after I've just narrowly been missed
by inches by an Exocet missile.

512
00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:31.000
And as soon as it came. I'd...

513
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.125
Out of the way. and I'd come down.
I'd do that two times a day.

514
00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:36.416
[woman] Must have been terrifying moments.

515
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:37.791
Oh. some of the worst.

516
00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:40.208
And some of the best.

517
00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:43.125
Those... Those... Those men.

518
00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:45.625
they... they-they really knew me. you know?

519
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.208
Well. there's no hiding in war.

520
00:33:48.708 --> 00:33:50.500
From your shipmates. Um...

[Jason] <i>Newsnight</i>? <i>Newsnight</i>?!

528
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:09.291
You saw that.

529

Can't... Can't you see
how good he is with people?

530
00:34:12.791 --> 00:34:15.208
How they like him

531
00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:18.041
- That's the plan. Amanda.
- Look. it's called charm.

532
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:20.958
Jason. you have to be
in the room with it to feel it.

533
00:34:21.875 --> 00:34:22.708
Television?

534
00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:24.833
Look. it was just a meeting.

535
00:34:24.833 --> 00:34:27.291
A meeting you shouldn't have taken.

536
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:28.750
Especially without me.

537
00:34:29.666 --> 00:34:30.708
This is my job.

538
00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:35.375
No. not now. Freddy.

539
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:39.333
- Did the liquid lunch go on the BBC tab?
- [sighs] I was so close.

540
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:44.125
Really? Think you have special powers over
a big beast like Buckingham Palace Comms?

541
00:34:44.125 --> 00:34:46.833
It was just the two of us. Nobody else.

542
00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:49.375
- And we were so close.
- To what?

543
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:53.000
An interview.
This Epstein story isn't going away.

544
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.375
Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein's girlfriend.
is one of Andrew's oldest friends.

545
00:34:57.375 --> 00:35:00.041
Then they're not gonna
talk to us about it. are they?

546
00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:02.625
Sam. it's celebrity fluff. not <i>Newsnight</i>.

547
00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:05.541
[Sam] It's not fluff.
It's exactly what we should be doing.

548
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:07.875
I'm sorry. but we don't have time
for you to spend

549
00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:11.666
a whole day chasing a story that
we're never gonna get. Not anymore.

550
00:35:12.708 --> 00:35:16.000
We're meant to be a team.
Why do you think you're so special?

551
00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:20.833
This is the work.

552
00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:25.208
All right? Today was the work because
this story is only going to get bigger.

553
00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:28.500
And when it does. we don't wanna be
the first people making the call.

554
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.833
We wanna be the first people <i>they</i> call.
And if I--

555
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.458
If I can't do my job
the way it needs to be done.

556

It's important. Thanks. bye.

You all right?

568

D'you know. I spend half my time

[Emily] I can't tell you
what the questions will be

- Well. um. <i>Newsnight</i> is forensic.

Um. it's tough. but never sensational.
And so is Emily.

00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:07.041
- And she's a woman.
- And she's a woman.

I can turn it around. Frankly. I mean...

it's a mistake even being in this room.

[Sam] And yet here you are.

772
00:49:39.666 --> 00:49:41.416
And I can promise you one thing.

773
00:49:41.416 --> 00:49:44.833
You can't turn it around
by staying silent.

774
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.208
You know how people see you. don't you?

775
00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:55.208

And. with respect.
the public see these stories.

781
00:50:15.666 --> 00:50:18.000

"Never complain. never explain."
But I'm afraid those days are over.

Yes. everyone has a voice now.

and what they're saying about you

794
00:50:58.208 --> 00:51:03.166
is a lot... stronger
than anything I just said.

795
00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:09.833
- Have you seen Twitter?
- No. I don't. uh. pay attention to that.

796
00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:10.916

So I'm just saying that's the story.

800
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.208
and it doesn't change

Your story.

804

Stewart. you're producing.
Sam. anyone who needs you. gets you.

866
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.041
Yes. is Fran there?

867
00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.500
Yes. extremely urgent.

868
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.166
With the director-general? Which opera?

869
00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:37.583
[woman singing opera in distance]

870
00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:38.791
[Fran] <i>When it's done.</i>

871
00:55:38.791 --> 00:55:42.083
nobody sees the cut
until the DG and I have seen it.

872
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.583
[opera singing continues]

873
00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:46.166
Lovely to see you both.

874
00:55:52.083 --> 00:55:54.083
Tony's keeping his options open.

875
00:55:54.583 --> 00:55:57.166
Well. it's not over
till the fat lady sings.

876
00:55:59.375 --> 00:56:01.416
[Esme] So the question is.

877
00:56:01.916 --> 00:56:04.083
what are we looking for?

878
00:56:04.583 --> 00:56:06.708
A confession?

879
00:56:06.708 --> 00:56:08.916
String of denials?

880
00:56:08.916 --> 00:56:10.166
An apology?

881
00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.041
No way he's confessing
unless he wants to go to jail.

882
00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:17.541
and we're not settling for an apology.
so we go after him hard with the facts.

883
00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:20.458
- Fine. So where do we start?
- [Freddy] Mm.

884
00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:24.916
July 15th. 2006. Jeffrey Epstein.
Ghislaine Maxwell. and Harvey Weinstein

885
00:56:24.916 --> 00:56:27.750
are at Beatrice's
Victorian-themed 18th birthday party.

886
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:31.000
Epstein wore white with gold buttons
and a chestful of medals.

887
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.708
His Florida home
had just been raided by police.

888
00:56:33.708 --> 00:56:36.041
Sorry. that's a lot to take in. in one go.

889
00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:37.875
July 15th. 2006.

890
00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:40.416
Epstein. Maxwell. and Harvey Weinstein

891
00:56:40.416 --> 00:56:43.791
are all at Beatrice's
Victorian-themed 18th birthday party.

892
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:47.833
Epstein wore white with gold buttons
and a chestful of medals.

893
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:50.500
His Florida home
had just been raided by police.

894
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.625
Sorry. that's a lot to take in. in one go.

895
00:56:52.625 --> 00:56:54.708
[all laughing]

896
00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:57.416
That is fantastic. Nowhere to hide.

897
00:56:58.416 --> 00:57:01.041
[Freddy] Andrew's tried to make it seem
his friendship with Ghislaine

898
00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:03.625
was the main reason
he spent time with Epstein.

899
00:57:04.125 --> 00:57:07.375
Problem is. it looks like
she was absolutely complicit

900
00:57:07.375 --> 00:57:09.583
in so much of what Epstein was doing.

901
00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:18.750
This painting of Clinton...
That's the Lewinsky dress.

902
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.041
[Freddy] Yep. Epstein had it on his wall.

903
00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:28.458
There was a life-sized naked doll
hanging from a chandelier.

904
00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:30.291
A massage room.

905
00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:32.583
Soap shaped like genitalia.

906
00:57:33.875 --> 00:57:36.625
You couldn't be anywhere near Epstein
and not know.

907
00:57:40.208 --> 00:57:43.708
[Sam's mum] <i>You know Lucas can
stay here tonight if you have to work.</i>

908
00:57:43.708 --> 00:57:46.166
No. it's fine. They don't need me anyway.

909
00:57:47.375 --> 00:57:48.958
<i>I don't believe that for a second.</i>

910
00:57:50.916 --> 00:57:52.708
Then why didn't they ask me to stay. Mum?

911
00:57:52.708 --> 00:57:56.166
<i>I bring in the interview.
and they still don't want me in the room.</i>

912
00:57:56.166 --> 00:57:58.958
Sam. you know how this works.

913
00:57:59.875 --> 00:58:02.000
People like us. we don't wait to be asked.

914
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.750
<i>We do what we have to do.</i>

915
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.125
<i>Did they ask you
to go after Prince Andrew?</i>

916
00:58:08.125 --> 00:58:10.583
- No.
- <i>No. they didn't.</i>

917
00:58:10.583 --> 00:58:11.500
<i>But you did.</i>

918
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.208
<i>Remember that.</i>

919
00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:16.333
And this interview.

920
00:58:17.708 --> 00:58:18.625
does it matter?

921
00:58:21.458 --> 00:58:22.750
Yeah. it matters.

922
00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.208
<i>Well. there you go. then.</i>

923
00:58:25.208 --> 00:58:27.291
[footsteps in lobby]

924
00:58:31.208 --> 00:58:32.833
Love you. Mum. [chuckles softly]

925
00:58:32.833 --> 00:58:34.583
I love you too. sweetheart.

926
00:58:36.375 --> 00:58:37.291
[sniffs]

927
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.500
[gentle music builds slowly]

928
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:14.875
[sighs deeply]

929
00:59:19.041 --> 00:59:21.041
[musical ringtone playing]

930
00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:25.708
Hello.

931
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.833
[Amanda] Sam. Uh...

932
00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.125
I hope it's not too early.

933
00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:36.916
[Esme] And the 29th. And you've got.
what. everything from the 17th of June?

934
00:59:36.916 --> 00:59:38.000
[Freddy] That's right.

935
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.208
- Can you put those on a memory stick?
- Yeah.

936
00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:41.291
[Sam] Amanda called.

937
00:59:44.083 --> 00:59:45.500
Is she pulling the plug?

938
00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:48.875
South Drawing Room.

939
00:59:49.666 --> 00:59:52.291
Two chairs in the middle of the floor.
Six feet apart.

940
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.708
It's like a western.

941
00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.791
<i>Like a gunfight in a western.</i>

942
00:59:57.791 --> 01:00:00.250
[tense music builds slowly]

943
01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:07.958
- Right.
- Huh.

944
01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:09.875
All set?

945
01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:11.916
[Esme] Emily.

946
01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:13.541
What's wrong?

947
01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:17.625
What if he just apologizes?

948
01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:21.166
What if I lay out all the facts.

949
01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:25.625
he doesn't admit to anything.
but he does say sorry?

950
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.125
What if he's good. Esme?

951
01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:31.958
Then it'll be great television.

952
01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:34.333
Well. that's not why I'm doing it.

953
01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:36.208
Well. why <i>are</i> you doing it?

954
01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:41.208
Monica Lewinsky.

955
01:00:42.541 --> 01:00:46.125
I feel like I let women down
by not asking Clinton about her.

956
01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:49.541
Sex with that woman
was actually consensual.

957
01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:52.958
She was 21.
He was the president of the United States.

958
01:00:53.666 --> 01:00:57.291
He got his life back.
She got decades of vicious misogyny.

959
01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:00.000
You push.

960
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
What?

961
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.500
If he's good. if he's saying sorry
for what these girls went through.

962
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.458
then... lean in and ask him
if he feels responsible as well as sorry.

963
01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:09.583
[Emily] What if he says no?

964
01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:12.583
Push again. with the photograph.
Show him the picture. Here.

965
01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:15.958
Here.

966
01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:22.916
But this photograph... is you.

967
01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:25.583
I don't believe I was ever there.

968
01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:29.458
that I ever even went upstairs
in that house.

969
01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:32.833
Um... You don't <i>recollect.</i>
Your Royal Highness.

970
01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:34.583
Yes. of course.

971
01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:36.750
So... it's a fake?

972
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.208
[Andrew] <i>As I say.</i>

973
01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:41.958
I have no recollection
of ever having been there

974
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.625
or even meeting that woman.

975
01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:48.208
Ms. Roberts.
Please don't ever say "that woman."

976
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.125
Ever.

977
01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:51.750
- Oh. for heaven's sake.
- I understand this is difficult.

978
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.250
And. of course.

979
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:56.583
you couldn't have been there
on that date. correct?

980
01:01:58.291 --> 01:01:59.166
Hm.

981
01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:03.708
You have denied. many times.

982
01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:07.583
having even met Virginia Giuffre.

983
01:02:07.583 --> 01:02:12.625
You have denied
her extremely serious allegations

984
01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:16.041
that she was forced to have sex with you

985
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:19.833
when she was just 17 years old.

986
01:02:19.833 --> 01:02:22.250
Now. either this happened

987
01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:25.125
or she's lying.

988
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.333
Which is it?

989
01:02:27.833 --> 01:02:28.750
[exhales]

990
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.958
Bingo. Brilliant.

991
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:33.791
We got him.

992
01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.208
Sam.

993
01:02:48.083 --> 01:02:48.916
Tell me.

994
01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:51.750
Nothing.

995
01:02:52.416 --> 01:02:53.291
Tell me.

996
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.583
I'm going in there. You're not.

997
01:02:56.583 --> 01:02:59.041
If you have something to say.
I want to hear it.

998
01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:01.375
[inhales deeply. sighs]

999
01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:05.666
It's just we offered him... space and time.

1000
01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:08.666
We offered him an interview.

1001
01:03:10.416 --> 01:03:13.583
Men like that hate it
when they're not heard.

1002
01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.125
He'll want to be heard.

1003
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:29.750
So the really big question...
is what do I wear?

1004
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.708
[laughter]

1005
01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:31.958
Black dress.

1006
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:34.541
Simple. elegant.

1007
01:03:34.541 --> 01:03:35.750
Hepburn/Maitlis.

1008
01:03:36.625 --> 01:03:37.666
My knees.

1009
01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:39.958
You've got the best knees on TV.

1010
01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:42.083
I don't want people looking at my knees.

1011
01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:45.416
You don't want <i>him</i> looking at your knees.
Actually. we <i>do</i> want him looking.

1012
01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:47.458
- That would be good TV.
- [chuckling]

1013
01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:49.166
[exhales deeply]

1014
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:53.125
[Esme] Emily?

1015
01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:56.833
Go home.

1016
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.500
I want you raring to go in the morning.

1017
01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:08.750
[Emily] 2006.

1018
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:13.125
Epstein was convicted of trafficking girls
as young as 14.

1019
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:18.250
Yet you continued relations with him
for another four years.

1020
01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.333
And yet you...

1021
01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:25.625
and yet you continued
your friendship with him until 2010.

1022
01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:27.708
[tense music plays softly]

1023
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.833
[panting] And yet you continued...

1024
01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.333
- [dog barks]
- Moody!

1025
01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.541
[tense music builds slowly]

1026
01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:58.500
That's great. Yeah. just in this room.
All right. Through there.

1027
01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:00.958
Moody!

1028
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.375
- ID. please. miss.
- Yeah. um...

1029
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.000
She's with me.

1030
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.375
Thanks!

1031
01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:13.458
Thanks.

1032
01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:21.208
[sighs]

1033
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.833
You chase them. you'll never catch them.

1034
01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:32.208
And then when they're ready to come.
you won't be there.

1035
01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:42.750
He might walk out. If Emily's doing to him
what I think. it's a strong possibility.

1036
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.458
If he does. film it.

1037
01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:47.750
- Whatever he does. do not stop filming.
- Stewart.

1038
01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.458
- Right.
- Um...

1039
01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:55.666
Your Royal Highness.

1040
01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:25.000
[Andrew] Sure about this?

1041
01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:27.250
Little bit. um...

1042
01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:30.250
[woman] A bit of powder.
Your Royal Highness?

1043
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.875
- Sure. What's your name?
- Cat.

1044
01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.375
- Okay? First question.
- Yeah.

1045
01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:37.000
I want it to set the tone. Straight in.
"Jeffrey Epstein was a child abuser."

1046
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.041
"You knew that when you went
to stay with him. didn't you?"

1047
01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.875
Only one answer to that.
Already he's got nowhere to go.

1048
01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:45.625
[Andrew] No. this needs
to be on the other side.

1049
01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:48.625
It's going through
the opposite edge of the chair.

1050
01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:50.458
That way. it won't stick out.

1051
01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:52.375
- Oh God.
- No. wait.

1052
01:06:53.791 --> 01:06:56.458
Let him be. We want him to be comfortable.

1053
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.583
Trousers.

1054
01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:06.791
[chuckles]

1055
01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:12.625
[bell ringing]

1056
01:07:12.625 --> 01:07:13.916
[Andrew grunts]

1057
01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:16.000
[stark. pensive music plays]

1058
01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:25.666
Just. uh...

1059
01:07:27.541 --> 01:07:30.083
<i>Just... be yourself.</i>

1060
01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:38.250
[Sam clears throat]

1061
01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:42.458
[Sam] That's not great.

1062
01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:46.333
Donal McCabe.
He's from the Queen's press office.

1063
01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.416
[Stewart] We didn't agree to that. did we?

1064
01:07:48.916 --> 01:07:50.041
[Sam] With the Queen?

1065
01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.166
No. But by all means. take it up with her.

1066
01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:54.375
[chuckles lightly]

1067
01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:00.500
[woman] Sound speed.

1068
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.250
[clock ticking]

1069
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:08.833
[man] Set.

1070
01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:11.625
Your Royal Highness.

1071
01:08:12.666 --> 01:08:15.583
We've come to Buckingham Palace

1072
01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:19.416
in highly unusual circumstances.

1073
01:08:20.291 --> 01:08:22.250
Normally. we'd be discussing your work...

1074
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.583
- [Andrew] Mm.
- ...your duty.

1075
01:08:23.583 --> 01:08:24.833
We'll come on to that.

1076
01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:26.375
But today.

1077
01:08:27.125 --> 01:08:30.250
you've chosen to speak out
for the first time.

1078
01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:34.375
Why have you decided to talk now?

1079
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.375
Because there is no good time

1080
01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:45.541
to talk about. um... Mr. Epstein

1081
01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:48.125
and all things associated.

1082
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.250
And we've been talking
to <i>Newsnight</i> for some time

1083
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:56.500
about. um. doing something
around the work that I was doing.

1084
01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.750
And unfortunately.
we've just not been able

1085
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:03.333
to fit into either your schedule
or my schedule until now... now.

1086
01:09:03.333 --> 01:09:08.583
Actually. it's a very good opportunity.
I'm delighted to be able to see you today.

1087
01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:10.583
As you say.

1088
01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:15.500
it all goes back to your friendship
with Jeffrey Epstein.

1089
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.625
Hmm.

1090
01:09:17.583 --> 01:09:20.333
How did you first become friends?

1091
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:21.750
How did you meet?

1092
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:25.500
Well. I met through his girlfriend.

1093
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.416
Um...

1094
01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:27.958
Back in 1999.

1095
01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:30.666
[whispers] It's too open. It's too easy.

1096
01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:33.375
[Andrew] I'd known Ghislaine
since university. In the UK.

1097
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:37.500
<i>And. um. I didn't spend much time...</i>

1098
01:09:38.916 --> 01:09:43.958
<i>I suppose I saw him once or twice a year.
perhaps maximum three times a year.</i>

1099
01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:50.083
and... quite often. um. if I was
in the United States and doing things.

1100
01:09:50.083 --> 01:09:52.541
and he wasn't there. he'd say.

1101
01:09:53.041 --> 01:09:56.000
"Why don't you come and use my houses?"

1102
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.166
And I said. "Thank you very much indeed."

1103
01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:04.250
But it would be... a considerable stretch
to say that we were very close friends.

1104
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.833
But he had the most extraordinary ability

1105
01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:11.583
to. um... to bring...
extraordinary people together.

1106
01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:14.041
And that's the bit that I remember.

1107
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:17.541
It's going to dinner parties
where you would meet...

1108
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:18.500
What's she doing?

1109
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.833
...academics. politicians...

1110
01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:22.625
She's letting him talk.

1111
01:10:22.625 --> 01:10:26.000
[Andrew] It was a cosmopolitan group
of what I would call--

1112
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.416
Did you trust him?

1113
01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:31.416
[hesitates] Um...

1114
01:10:31.416 --> 01:10:33.125
Yes. I think I probably did.

1115
01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.750
but. um...

1116
01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:40.625
Obviously. I don't go into...
um. a friendship

1117
01:10:41.166 --> 01:10:45.375
looking for the... the wrong thing.
if you understand what I mean.

1118
01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.458
I... I'm an engaging person.

1119
01:10:47.458 --> 01:10:50.000
I want to be able to engage.

1120
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.916
Am I right in thinking
you threw a birthday party

1121
01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:58.916
for Epstein's girlfriend.
Ghislaine Maxwell. at Sandringham?

1122
01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:02.500
No. it was a shooting weekend.

1123
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.583
A shooting weekend?

1124
01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:06.916
Yes. just a straightforward...
straightforward shooting weekend.

1125
01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:14.166
But during these times
that he was a guest at Windsor Castle.

1126
01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:16.666
at Sandringham. this shooting weekend...

1127
01:11:16.666 --> 01:11:17.750
Yep.

1128
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:21.583
We now know... that he had been

1129
01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:26.416
procuring young girls...
for sex trafficking.

1130
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.541
We <i>now</i> know that.

1131
01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.208
At the time.

1132
01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:40.125
there was no indication.

1133
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.583
to me... or anybody else.

1134
01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:47.833
that that's what he was doing.

1135
01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.958
Absolutely no indication.

1136
01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.333
- [knocking]
- [inhales]

1137
01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:54.125
Flight logs for Epstein's jet.

1138
01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.541
The. uh. quote "Lolita Express."

1139
01:11:57.458 --> 01:12:00.333
PA. Prince Andrew. is a frequent flyer.

1140
01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:01.958
So is BC. Bill.

1141
01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.833
and GM. Ghislaine Maxwell.

1142
01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:07.375
Princes. presidents. and females.

1143
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:09.875
The girls don't get named.

1144
01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:14.625
Just so our ducks are in a row
when all of Fleet Street comes knocking.

1145
01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:19.708
Just for the record.
you've been on his private plane.

1146
01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:21.208
Yes.

1147
01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:24.750
You've been to stay on his private island.

1148
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.083
Yes.

1149
01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.750
You've stayed at his home in Palm Beach.

1150
01:12:30.291 --> 01:12:31.125
Yes.

1151
01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:34.708
So. in 2006. in May.

1152
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.875
an arrest warrant was issued for Epstein

1153
01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:41.750
for sexual assault of a minor.

1154
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:42.833
Yes.

1155
01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:47.458
He was released in July of 2010.

1156
01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:48.916
And within months.

1157
01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:52.541
you went to stay with him
at his New York mansion.

1158
01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:56.875
Why?

1159
01:12:57.708 --> 01:13:01.750
Why were you staying
with a convicted sex offender?

1160
01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:09.791
Now. I went to see him
with the sole purpose of saying to him

1161
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:14.625
that because he had been convicted.

1162
01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:20.500
it was inappropriate
that we should be seen together.

1163
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:25.125
I felt that doing it over the telephone
was the chicken's way of doing it.

1164
01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:27.625
I had to go and see him and talk to him.

1165
01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:31.708
I went to see him. We had an opportunity
to go for a walk in the park.

1166
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:35.208
and that was the... uh. conversation.

1167
01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.750
coincidentally.

1168
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.958
that was photographed.

1169
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:45.958
When I... I said to him. I said.
"Look. because of what has... happened.

1170
01:13:47.208 --> 01:13:52.708
I don't think it is appropriate
for us to remain in contact."

1171
01:13:53.375 --> 01:13:54.916
And by mutual decision.

1172
01:13:55.416 --> 01:13:58.458
we agreed to part company. and I left.

1173
01:13:58.458 --> 01:14:02.958
He threw a party to celebrate his release.

1174
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.458
and you were invited as a guest of honor.

1175
01:14:06.458 --> 01:14:07.625
No. I didn't go.

1176
01:14:11.125 --> 01:14:12.541
Oh. in 2010.

1177
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:17.083
There... Well. there...
There certainly wasn't a... a party

1178
01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:23.708
to celebrate his release in... December.
because it was only a small dinner party.

1179
01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:26.208
There were only
eight or ten of us at the dinner.

1180
01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.250
If there was a... a party.

1181
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:29.916
then I know nothing about that.

1182
01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:32.041
You were invited to that dinner

1183
01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:34.041
as a guest of honor.

1184
01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:39.166
I was there. so I was at the dinner.
I don't think it was as you might put it.

1185
01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.708
but. okay. I was there.
I was there at a dinner.

1186
01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:43.333
I'm just trying to work this out

1187
01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:46.666
because you said
you went to break up the relationship.

1188
01:14:46.666 --> 01:14:51.750
and yet you stayed
at that New York mansion several days.

1189
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:53.166
I'm wondering how long--

1190
01:14:53.166 --> 01:14:55.583
I was doing a number
of other things while I was there.

1191
01:14:55.583 --> 01:14:58.583
But you were staying at the house
of a convicted sex offender.

1192
01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:00.708
It was a convenient place to stay.

1193
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:04.750
[brooding music plays softly]

1194
01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.416
So I've spoken to <i>Panorama</i>.

1195
01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:17.625
Virginia Roberts says the original photo
was printed and date stamped

1196
01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:19.416
two days after it was taken.

1197
01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:22.500
and we have an affidavit
from a witness in 2001

1198
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.375
who saw the photo at the time.

1199
01:15:25.916 --> 01:15:27.458
- Freddy?
- Yeah?

1200
01:15:27.458 --> 01:15:28.458
Thank you.

1201
01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:29.416
Yeah.

1202
01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:33.708
[Emily] One of Epstein's accusers.

1203
01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:35.000
Virginia Roberts.

1204
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:39.125
made allegations against you.

1205
01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:41.916
In a legal deposition.

1206
01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:47.875
she said she had sex with you three times.

1207
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:51.166
Once in a London house

1208
01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:55.333
when she was trafficked to you
in Maxwell's house.

1209
01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:56.250
[softly] Uh...

1210
01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:59.458
Once... in New York

1211
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.958
a month or so later in Epstein's mansion.

1212
01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:06.791
and once on his private island.

1213
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.625
in a group of seven or eight other girls.

1214
01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:16.166
No. [scoffs]

1215
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.375
No to all of it?

1216
01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:20.291
All of it.

1217
01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:25.250
Absolutely no to all of it.

1218
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:30.125
Are you saying you don't believe her?

1219
01:16:30.666 --> 01:16:31.833
She's lying?

1220
01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:40.541
That's a difficult thing
for me to. um... answer

1221
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:43.833
because I don't know

1222
01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:48.208
what she's. um. trying to achieve.

1223
01:16:48.208 --> 01:16:50.166
But I can tell you...

1224
01:16:51.208 --> 01:16:53.333
uh... categorically.

1225
01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:57.458
I don't remember meeting her at all.

1226
01:16:58.333 --> 01:17:01.750
I do not remember
a photograph being taken.

1227
01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.416
and I've said.

1228
01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:07.375
consistently and. um...

1229
01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.416
frequently.

1230
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.250
that we never had
any sort of sexual contact whatever.

1231
01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:21.791
She says she met you in 2001.

1232
01:17:23.041 --> 01:17:25.041
She says she dined with you.

1233
01:17:25.833 --> 01:17:27.458
danced with you.

1234
01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.125
You bought her drinks

1235
01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:32.250
at Tramp nightclub in London.

1236
01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:35.375
There's a number of things wrong
with that story. One of which is that...

1237
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:42.833
I don't know where the bar is in Tramps.

1238
01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:45.291
Um...

1239
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.666
Um. I don't drink.

1240
01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:56.125
Um. I... I don't think I've ever bought
a drink in Tramps whenever I was there.

1241
01:17:56.125 --> 01:17:58.416
Do you remember dancing with her?

1242
01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:03.291
No. that couldn't have happened
because on that particular date.

1243
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:06.083
I was. um. at home.
I was with the children.

1244
01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:11.083
And I had taken Beatrice
to a Pizza Express in Woking

1245
01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:16.666
for a party. I think...
round about 4:00. 5:00 in the afternoon.

1246
01:18:16.666 --> 01:18:19.916
Why would you remember that
so specifically?

1247
01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:25.166
Because going to Pizza Express in Woking

1248
01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:28.625
is an unusual thing for me to do.

1249
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.083
A very unusual thing for me to do.

1250
01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:37.333
Uh. stop. Um...

1251
01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:38.708
Can... Can we?

1252
01:18:39.416 --> 01:18:41.958
Please. um. I would like to go back.

1253
01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:45.750
I would like to make a...
a specific reference to the date.

1254
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:46.791
March the 10th.

1255
01:18:46.791 --> 01:18:49.125
I think it's perfectly clear.
Do we need that?

1256
01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:51.250
I think we're rolling well.
don't you. Emily?

1257
01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:54.208
- No?
- No.

1258
01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.083
[scoffs]

1259
01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:07.833
- She was very specific about that night.
- Mm-hmm.

1260
01:19:07.833 --> 01:19:10.583
She described dancing with you.

1261
01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:13.041
- No.
- And you profusely sweating.

1262
01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:14.083
[scoffs]

1263
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:20.041
Um. there's a... there's a. um...
a slight problem with the sweating.

1264
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:24.833
But... because I have. um.
a... peculiar condition.

1265
01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:28.250
which is that I don't sweat.
or rather I didn't sweat at the time.

1266
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.500
And that would. um... Oh. actually...

1267
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.083
Yes. I didn't sweat at the time.

1268
01:19:33.083 --> 01:19:34.916
and that's because I suffered

1269
01:19:34.916 --> 01:19:40.291
what I would describe as an overdose
of adrenaline in the Falklands War

1270
01:19:40.291 --> 01:19:42.666
when I was shot at. and I simply. um...

1271
01:19:42.666 --> 01:19:46.708
it... it... it was almost impossible
for me to... to... to sweat.

1272
01:19:53.458 --> 01:19:54.541
I wonder

1273
01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:59.041
if you have any sense of

1274
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.708
guilt. regret. or shame

1275
01:20:06.041 --> 01:20:08.625
about any of your behavior

1276
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:11.500
in your friendship with Epstein.

1277
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500
On balance...

1278
01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:24.000
could I have avoided... ever meeting him?

1279
01:20:25.041 --> 01:20:25.875
Mm...

1280
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.000
I don't think so.

1281
01:20:28.541 --> 01:20:32.000
and that's because of
my friendship with Ghislaine.

1282
01:20:34.833 --> 01:20:38.000
[sighs through lips] Do I regret the fact

1283
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000
that he's quite obviously. uh.
conducted himself in a manner unbecoming...

1284
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.208
[Emily] "Unbecoming"?
He was a sex offender.

1285
01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.250
Yes. I'm sorry. I... I was being polite.

1286
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:52.833
I mean. in the sense that
he was a sex offender. But. no. um...

1287
01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:57.583
Was I right in having him as a friend?

1288
01:20:58.583 --> 01:20:59.500
Um...

1289
01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:01.833
At the time.

1290
01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:08.583
bearing in mind this was some years before
he was accused of being a sex offender.

1291
01:21:10.708 --> 01:21:14.875
I don't think
there was anything wrong... then.

1292
01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:23.125
The problem was. after the fact.
that after he had been convicted...

1293
01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.041
- You stayed with him.
- I stayed with him.

1294
01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:28.083
And that's the bit that. um. as it were.

1295
01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:30.583
I kick myself for
on a daily basis. [chuckles]

1296
01:21:30.583 --> 01:21:34.833
Because that... it was... it was not. um.
becoming of a member of the royal family.

1297
01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:39.000
and we... we try to uphold
the highest standards and practices.

1298
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.916
and I... I let the side down.
simple as that.

1299
01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.541
- [music fades]
- [clock ticking]

1300
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:04.958
Is there anything
you feel has been left unsaid

1301
01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:07.541
that you would like to say now?

1302
01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:12.041
No. I don't think so.

1303
01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:17.875
You probably dragged out of me
most of what's required.

1304
01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:19.958
[breathes deeply]

1305
01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:22.958
[tense music playing]

1306
01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:25.125
[camera whirring]

1307
01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:26.250
[exhales deeply]

1308
01:22:26.916 --> 01:22:27.833
I'm gonna go.

1309
01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:32.458
I have a biker downstairs.
The memory cards. Both copies...

1310
01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:34.583
Now. would you all like a tour?

1311
01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:35.583
Some stills?

1312
01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:39.666
Ah. Yes. of course. Um...
Tell you what. two birds. one stone.

1313
01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:42.041
You take your snaps
while I show Emily around.

1314
01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:44.125
[unsettling music intensifies]

1315
01:22:46.083 --> 01:22:48.083
[soundscape distorts eerily]

1316
01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.541
[distorted] Wasn't he wonderful?

1317
01:23:04.458 --> 01:23:05.583
[softly] Wonderful.

1318
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:10.375
[music fades]

1319
01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:11.833
[sighs]

1320
01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:13.791
[tense music builds]

1321
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.333
- [chattering indistinctly]
- [camera clicks]

1322
01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:37.250
[music fades out]

1323
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.500
You know. I thought
that all went very well.

1324
01:23:41.458 --> 01:23:43.083
Like a walk in the park.

1325
01:23:49.916 --> 01:23:51.916
[pensive music plays]

1326
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.041
[clattering]

1327
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:00.791
Expecting a car. madam?

1328
01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:03.250
Uh... Uh. no. Thank you.

1329
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:05.750
Um... I think I'm going to walk.

1330
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:06.791
But thank you.

1331
01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:20.750
- I think I might be sick.
- [both chuckle]

1332
01:24:45.708 --> 01:24:46.958
Emily. That was...

1333
01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:49.041
[breathes deeply]

1334
01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:52.041
That was him... right there. You did it.

1335
01:24:54.041 --> 01:24:54.875
<i>We</i> did it.

1336
01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:58.458
Thanks. Sammy.

1337
01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:03.875
[pensive music continues]

1338
01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:10.458
[Stewart] How are we doing?

1339
01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:12.791
Twitter teasers are nearly ready.
When do we go live?

1340
01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:15.125
[Stewart] I'm gonna talk
to the DG about that now.

1341
01:25:22.208 --> 01:25:23.083
[chuckles softly]

1342
01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:28.500
She had her man in the room when you shot
the interview. He recorded it. Yes?

1343
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.916
Could she stop it going out. Tony?

1344
01:25:30.916 --> 01:25:34.875
Well. she is the Queen.
I mean. I'd have to take the call.

1345
01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:37.541
We want to trail it on Friday night
after the show. live.

1346
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:38.875
With Emily?

1347
01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:41.208
Of course.
With teasers on socials afterwards.

1348
01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:44.083
[Tony] I'll tell the Palace
we're broadcasting on Saturday night.

1349
01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.666
Wait for me to get back to you.

1350
01:25:51.458 --> 01:25:52.875
[doors opening]

1351
01:26:00.333 --> 01:26:01.166
How long?

1352
01:26:01.666 --> 01:26:02.500
Fifteen minutes.

1353
01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.708
[Emily] I guess no news is good news.

1354
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:07.125
Oh...

1355
01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:12.416
- Tony?
- <i>Esme. hi.</i>

1356
01:26:16.791 --> 01:26:18.958
Pull the trigger. We're on.

1357
01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:23.208
Tomorrow night.
in a <i>Newsnight</i> special program.

1358
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:29.250
we will hear for the first time
from the duke himself.

1359
01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:31.666
In an unprecedented interview.

1360
01:26:31.666 --> 01:26:35.958
he speaks to us at length
about his friendship with Epstein

1361
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.625
and the claims made against him.

1362
01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:42.666
Prince Andrew. the Duke of York.

1363
01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:48.333
has long faced questions about his ties
to the financier Jeffrey Epstein.

1364
01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:51.166
who took his life earlier this year

1365
01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.333
while awaiting trial on sex...

1366
01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:55.375
[gentle anticipative music builds slowly]

1367
01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:57.458
[notification alerts chime faintly]

1368

[phone buzzes]

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.708
[music trails off]

1370
01:27:47.416 --> 01:27:50.375
- Where does this bloody dust come from?
- I know. sir.

1371
01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:55.083
[elevator dings]

1372
01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:59.083
[Amanda] <i>"For the prince. the whole

1373
01:27:59.083 --> 01:28:01.541

1377
01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:19.000
Huh.

1378
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.041
