to be taken?

was not by her design.

It wasn't Elisabeta's.

183
00:18:26.504 --> 00:18:27.639
Does it mean anything to you?

184
00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:31.710
It's forgery.

nonetheless.

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:43.822
I know you have your ways.

189
00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:46.791
What kind of friend would I be
if I abandoned Elisabeta

190
00:18:46.824 --> 00:18:49.327
in her hour of need?

191
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.396
I'll ask my spirit guides.

192
00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:55.767
You know. she blames me
for her mother's passing.

193
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.574
Her feelings for you
were... complicated.

194
00:19:02.607 --> 00:19:05.243
What else could I do?

195
00:19:05.276 --> 00:19:09.614
Watch as they grow old and die?

196
00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:11.383
I loved them.

197
00:19:13.818 --> 00:19:17.355
Her mother could not stand

198
00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:21.593
the burden of this
new way of living.

199
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:28.500
You call it living. but I don't
think Elisabeta ever did.

200
00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:31.803
I could not stand an
eternity if I lost her.

201
00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:36.241
She is the last mortal thing
I was responsible for.

202
00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:40.378
I must find her.

203
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:43.215
You could pay Ramses a visit.

204
00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:44.916
He may be able to help you.

205
00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:46.785
Ramses?

206
00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:49.821
Why him of all creatures?

207
00:19:49.854 --> 00:19:54.660
Because this forgery is
of Egyptian make.

208
00:20:07.672 --> 00:20:09.541
[footsteps approaching]

209
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:13.745
[grunts]

210
00:20:29.827 --> 00:20:30.929
I'll starve.

211
00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:36.568
Wait. wait.

212
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:37.869
What's your name?

213
00:20:42.573 --> 00:20:44.243
Boris.

214
00:20:47.078 --> 00:20:50.448
What are you. Boris?

215
00:20:50.481 --> 00:20:51.850
You don't smell like him.

216
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.754
You smell like me.

217
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.960
Like the dead.

218
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.366
Dead.

219
00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:09.501
How is that possible?

220
00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:14.773
May I touch your face?

221
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.375
Hurt?

222
00:21:17.408 --> 00:21:19.444
No. no. no. no hurt.

223
00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:29.354
-Father!
-[Frankenstein cackling]

224
00:21:36.527 --> 00:21:38.563
I. I saw what he did to you.

225
00:21:41.432 --> 00:21:44.102
When I touch someone.

226
00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:47.539
I can see things.
feel things.

227
00:21:49.006 --> 00:21:50.809
I can't shift into creatures
of the night

228
00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:53.812
or mist like my father.

229
00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:58.517
but the one thing I can do that
he cannot is read minds.

230
00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:02.487
Share people's memories.

231
00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:13.698
Let me out. and I will rip
your father into a thousand

232
00:22:13.731 --> 00:22:16.067
bright red pieces
for what he did to you.

233
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.602
[grunts]

234
00:22:17.635 --> 00:22:19.070
What is it?

235
00:22:19.103 --> 00:22:22.474
Don't trust vampires.

236
00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.409
Please. I just want to...

237
00:22:24.442 --> 00:22:25.977
Boris. wait!

238
00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:47.532
Ramses?

239
00:22:50.968 --> 00:22:52.504
Show yourself.

240
00:23:21.632 --> 00:23:24.436
I sense you. old friend.

241
00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:28.707
It is a shame to see
you wasted like this.

242
00:23:31.008 --> 00:23:32.911
Who would seek your
immortal heart?

243
00:23:34.178 --> 00:23:35.914
What good would it do?

244
00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:40.051
[rat squeaking]

245
00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:41.453
Tanna leaves.

246
00:24:16.587 --> 00:24:18.957
Rise. Ramses.

247
00:24:26.597 --> 00:24:28.500
Damn.

248
00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:38.977
Despite it all. to your friends.
you were always kind-hearted.

249
00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:43.949
A heart.

250
00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:55.760
Too desiccated.

251
00:24:55.793 --> 00:24:57.596
Needs to be fresh.

252
00:25:00.164 --> 00:25:01.766
Must find it.

253
00:25:18.282 --> 00:25:19.584
[rat squeaks]

254
00:25:22.186 --> 00:25:23.555
[rat squeals]

255
00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:51.950
That should do it.

256
00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.162
I'm sorry. my friend.

257
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.268
I tried. but your
curse is stubborn.

258
00:26:16.307 --> 00:26:19.811
But my blood is
stronger than curses.

259
00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:35.059
Rise. Ramses.

260
00:26:35.092 --> 00:26:37.896
I command you!

261
00:26:40.965 --> 00:26:41.967
[groaning]

262
00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:46.638
Osiris be praised.

263
00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:48.340
Osiris had help.

264
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.112
Vlad Dracul.

265
00:26:56.313 --> 00:27:00.318
You shared your blood with me.

266
00:27:00.351 --> 00:27:02.420
Do not worry.

267
00:27:02.453 --> 00:27:05.657
If I don't bite.
you won't turn.

268
00:27:07.925 --> 00:27:10.328
Blood is life.

269
00:27:10.361 --> 00:27:11.930
I owe you mine.

270
00:27:14.098 --> 00:27:16.300
Don't consider me ungrateful.

271
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:18.970
but why are you here?

272
00:27:20.938 --> 00:27:22.173
Long story.

273
00:27:25.843 --> 00:27:27.745
Tell me...

274
00:27:27.778 --> 00:27:29.814
What happened to you?

275
00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:33.818
Someone came.

276
00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:37.055
A big man.

277
00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:39.824
But it was not a man.

278
00:27:39.857 --> 00:27:41.726
He took my...

279
00:27:43.494 --> 00:27:47.732
my...
My heart.

280
00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:50.735
It does not fit.

281
00:27:51.969 --> 00:27:55.373
Because it is not yours.

282
00:27:55.406 --> 00:27:58.710
Whose is it?

283
00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.244
Just...

284
00:28:00.277 --> 00:28:03.815
Concentrate on recovering
what is rightfully yours.

285
00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:07.218
Yes.

286
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:09.353
And recover it. I will.

287
00:28:09.386 --> 00:28:12.323
The creature will pay dearly.

288
00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:15.827
The creature that...

289
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.295
wore this.

290
00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:18.429
Yes.

291
00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:20.898
This is how it drew me out.

292
00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:24.035
It is a forgery.
but I was fooled.

293
00:28:26.103 --> 00:28:28.173
Something similar
belonged to my bride.

294
00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:33.845
Why would he seek
out your heart?

295
00:28:35.112 --> 00:28:37.315
Many reasons.

296
00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:38.917
Immortality. for one.

297
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.187
Didn't work for you.

298
00:28:44.054 --> 00:28:46.157
When the heart is removed.

299
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.893
the magic goes with it.

300
00:28:48.926 --> 00:28:53.865
I. however. am a
cursed weapon of Anubis.

301
00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:58.870
And I have other ways
to stay alive.

302
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.139
You knew this much.

303
00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:04.275
And again.
I am in your debt.

304
00:29:05.476 --> 00:29:07.945
Have you seen him before?

305
00:29:07.978 --> 00:29:10.248
He was a stranger.

306
00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:12.049
Did he say anything?

307
00:29:12.082 --> 00:29:15.186
He did say one thing.

308
00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:16.521
Frankenstein.

309
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:20.125
Frankenstein?

310
00:29:22.459 --> 00:29:24.028
Who's that?

311
00:29:31.202 --> 00:29:32.370
Where have you been?

312
00:29:37.474 --> 00:29:39.010
All right. come here.

313
00:29:42.146 --> 00:29:46.584
Tonight. you're going
to this address.

314
00:29:46.617 --> 00:29:50.454
That's the one and
only Invisible Man.

315
00:29:50.487 --> 00:29:54.325
Yeah.
And he's a bad man.

316
00:29:54.358 --> 00:29:57.929
So. if he happens
to get killed.

317
00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.231
it's not going to be a problem.

318
00:30:00.264 --> 00:30:03.301
I just need a piece of his skin.

319
00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.369
It will reappear

320
00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:08.439
when it's disconnected
from his circulatory system.

321
00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:12.577
You're going to need this.

322
00:30:16.413 --> 00:30:18.549
Get a nice long piece.

323
00:30:18.582 --> 00:30:20.451
More than one if you can.

324
00:30:22.286 --> 00:30:24.889
Put it in here.

325
00:30:24.922 --> 00:30:26.357
Okay. and bring it back.

326
00:30:29.193 --> 00:30:30.295
Okay.

327
00:30:47.244 --> 00:30:49.247
[knocking]

328
00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:54.952
Oh. hell.

329
00:30:54.985 --> 00:30:56.988
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

330
00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.623
Hold your horses.

331
00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:00.592
Friend or foe.
answer quickly.

332
00:31:02.593 --> 00:31:05.396
Hello?

333
00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:06.998
Well. that's rude.

334
00:31:08.432 --> 00:31:10.334
[grunts]

335
00:31:10.367 --> 00:31:12.136
Now...

336
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:13.271
You weren't invited.

337
00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:16.607
You don't want to do that.

338
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.543
Who sent you?
Was it Tobias?

339
00:31:19.576 --> 00:31:21.512
I told him I'd pay
him on Sunday.

340
00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:23.481
It's Friday. for God's sake.

341
00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:25.449
Good for the money.

342
00:31:25.482 --> 00:31:27.518
I never welsh on a debt.

343
00:31:28.986 --> 00:31:30.922
Damn!

344
00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:31.956
Getting serious. now. huh?

345
00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:48.439
FRANKENSTEIN [voice over]:
My magnum opus is at an end.

346
00:31:48.472 --> 00:31:52.143
If all goes well.
death will be conquered

347
00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:55.947
and I'll be fully
a god among men.

348
00:31:58.382 --> 00:32:01.185
-Why are you doing this?
-Frankenstein.

349
00:32:01.218 --> 00:32:02.620
[screaming]

350
00:32:22.272 --> 00:32:26.210
A stout and a red.

351
00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.320
Very nice.

352
00:32:36.353 --> 00:32:39.123
You know. my skin gets dry. too.

353
00:32:39.156 --> 00:32:42.326
I would suggest a
little sheep's milk.

354
00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:44.095
if you do not mind the smell.

355
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:45.129
You can just rub
it in and...

356
00:32:45.162 --> 00:32:47.598
Thank you. dear lady.

357
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:49.734
I don't think sheep's milk
would suit me.

358
00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.702
You never know.

359
00:32:51.735 --> 00:32:55.573
My aunt Selma. she used
to have the driest skin.

360
00:32:55.606 --> 00:32:57.141
That will be all.

361
00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:07.752
She's right. you know.

362
00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:11.022
Sheep's milk is a miracle
cure for dry skin.

363
00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.757
My grandmother swore by it.

364
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.394
Do you think it would cure
being dead for centuries?

365
00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:18.396
Worth a try.

366
00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.531
Allow me to draw your
wandering attentions

367
00:33:20.564 --> 00:33:23.634
to the pressing facts.

368
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:27.371
If this Frankenstein is in
possession of the bracelet...

369
00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:30.241
Then this Frankenstein is
in possession of Elisabeta.

370
00:33:34.211 --> 00:33:37.648
Which means we have
a common enemy.

371
00:33:37.681 --> 00:33:42.053
Yes. but who in
Hell's dominion is Frankenstein?

372
00:33:46.356 --> 00:33:48.426
I haven't the foggiest notion.

373
00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:51.162
but luckily I just dug up
someone who may.

374
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.733
[whispering]

375
00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:16.254
I have always found
necromancy so distasteful.

376
00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:23.661
Lucky for us. Mila doesn't
mind getting the hands dirty.

377
00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.469
[whispering continues]

378
00:34:38.842 --> 00:34:43.614
In her day. Browning was
a world-renowned medium.

379
00:34:43.647 --> 00:34:47.251
She was so powerful that
even in death

380
00:34:47.284 --> 00:34:50.688
she could be called upon
to consult the other side.

381
00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:53.757
She walks between worlds.

382
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.660
She likes to say
corpses are forever.

383
00:34:59.496 --> 00:35:03.234
Good evening. Miss Browning.

384
00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:06.137
It's you. Mila.

385
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.738
How you've grown.

386
00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:10.574
You look just like
your darling mother.

387
00:35:10.607 --> 00:35:13.844
We're searching for someone and
I was hoping you could help us.

388
00:35:13.877 --> 00:35:16.714
I'll do my best.

389
00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:20.484
Does the name Frankenstein
mean anything to you?

390
00:35:20.517 --> 00:35:22.653
I knew a man.

391
00:35:22.686 --> 00:35:26.157
A foreign doctor by that name.

392
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.326
He was famous in his homeland.

393
00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:31.395
Infamous. really.

394
00:35:31.428 --> 00:35:33.664
And where is he?

395
00:35:33.697 --> 00:35:35.399
Uh...

396
00:35:37.901 --> 00:35:39.570
[whispering voices]

397
00:35:43.507 --> 00:35:44.609
Is she asleep?

398
00:35:47.444 --> 00:35:49.313
I'm searching the beyond.

399
00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:52.517
Apologies.

400
00:35:55.919 --> 00:35:57.655
[whispering voices]

401
00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:03.861
Whereabouts unknown.

402
00:36:03.894 --> 00:36:07.231
It's like he's been cast
from our purview.

403
00:36:07.264 --> 00:36:11.235
He's blind to all third eyes.

404
00:36:11.268 --> 00:36:16.507
He's being punished
for playing God.

405
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.242
Playing God?

406
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.749
He made a man and gave it
life against God's will.

407
00:36:28.952 --> 00:36:31.222
What could this
Doctor Frankenstein want

408
00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:33.391
with a vampire
and an immortal heart?

409
00:36:36.927 --> 00:36:40.264
Whatever it is. he was willing
to kill me to get it.

410
00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:44.835
And who knows what he
is doing to Elisabeta.

411
00:36:44.868 --> 00:36:47.238
Elisabeta was taken alive.

412
00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:49.540
Whatever he needs from her.
he won't kill her for it.

413
00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:52.643
She still lives.

414
00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:55.846
She still breathes.

415
00:36:57.814 --> 00:37:01.285
I can sense her life.

416
00:37:01.318 --> 00:37:04.388
[whispering voices]

417
00:37:04.421 --> 00:37:10.327
Resurrection is what
the others whisper.

418
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.663
Resurrection?

419
00:37:12.696 --> 00:37:15.766
Perhaps he wants
to become a vampire.

420
00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:19.237
There are easier ways
to damn your soul.

421
00:37:21.605 --> 00:37:23.541
And why would
he need my heart for that?

422
00:37:24.908 --> 00:37:26.744
Wait.

423
00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:30.881
[whispering voices]

424
00:37:30.914 --> 00:37:33.917
A warning.

425
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:35.486
What he attempts...

426
00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:40.758
must be brought
to an end immediately.

427
00:37:41.825 --> 00:37:43.861
What is he attempting?

428
00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:49.333
He seeks to make death obsolete

429
00:37:49.366 --> 00:37:51.569
so he can create...

430
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:57.074
a homunculus from immortals.

431
00:37:57.107 --> 00:38:00.477
It's a foul. twisted thing.

432
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:05.816
an unkillable abomination that
will wreak havoc on the world.

433
00:38:05.849 --> 00:38:08.552
We cannot allow him to continue.

434
00:38:08.585 --> 00:38:10.487
He must be stopped.

435
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.589
Then tell me where he is.

436
00:38:12.622 --> 00:38:16.060
I will tear him apart
if you just point the way.

437
00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.363
Cannot.

438
00:38:19.396 --> 00:38:22.333
Mediums are limited by what the
spirit world allows them to see.

439
00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.002
Wait.

440
00:38:25.035 --> 00:38:28.005
[whispering voices]

441
00:38:28.038 --> 00:38:29.407
Yes. I see.

442
00:38:31.408 --> 00:38:34.812
They tell me he seeks
the unseen man.

443
00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:37.781
Who?

444
00:38:37.814 --> 00:38:39.516
Griffin.

445
00:38:39.549 --> 00:38:40.818
We must go.

446
00:38:42.652 --> 00:38:44.455
I thank you. ladies.

447
00:39:02.038 --> 00:39:03.841
I think we have the right place.

448
00:39:07.177 --> 00:39:08.512
What?

449
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.482
Blood.

450
00:39:13.116 --> 00:39:14.118
[groaning]

451
00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:21.058
[groaning continues]

452
00:39:21.091 --> 00:39:22.693
Griffin.

453
00:39:22.726 --> 00:39:24.762
Help me.

454
00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.430
Who did this?

455
00:39:26.463 --> 00:39:28.165
Big fella.

456
00:39:28.198 --> 00:39:30.768
Strong.
As an ox.

457
00:39:33.136 --> 00:39:34.838
Was it Frankenstein?

458
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:37.908
How... do you know that name?

459
00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:43.414
Will you heal?

460
00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:45.149
Not any time soon.

461
00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:47.418
I'm raw.

462
00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.052
I can't move.

463
00:39:49.085 --> 00:39:51.555
Will you allow me to share
my blood with you?

464
00:39:51.588 --> 00:39:55.192
It will heal you.

465
00:39:55.225 --> 00:39:57.928
Will I... you know?

466
00:39:57.961 --> 00:40:00.464
No.

467
00:40:00.497 --> 00:40:03.134
You will not join
the Legion of the Undead.

468
00:40:06.236 --> 00:40:09.973
[groaning]

469
00:40:10.006 --> 00:40:11.542
[electrical crackling]

470
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.489
Oh. good.

471
00:40:25.522 --> 00:40:26.624
Put it down.

472
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:29.660
Yeah.

473
00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.462
Wow.

474
00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.864
That's incredible.

475
00:40:33.897 --> 00:40:37.201
Hey. Griffin was
a genius. wasn't he?

476
00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:38.502
Did you kill him?

477
00:40:40.837 --> 00:40:42.573
It's all right.

478
00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.708
It was good.

479
00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:49.179
I.... good?

480
00:40:49.212 --> 00:40:53.951
You're nothing more than a
human hammer. mostly useless.

481
00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:56.687
except when
I need to make a dent.

482
00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.823
I'm going to need you tomorrow
night for another job.

483
00:40:59.856 --> 00:41:01.659
Until then you can
get out of here.

484
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:07.498
Go. Boris.

485
00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:08.632
I can barely stand
to look at you.

486
00:41:23.213 --> 00:41:24.615
[grunting]

487
00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.283
[footsteps approaching]

488
00:41:26.316 --> 00:41:27.985
[gasps]

489
00:41:43.867 --> 00:41:45.870
I... scare?

490
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.207
No. I'm not scared.

491
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.612
I...
I suppose I'm just annoyed.

492
00:41:58.248 --> 00:42:00.017
Have you been crying?

493
00:42:02.852 --> 00:42:04.221
Did he hurt you again?

494
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.667
I'd be happy to.

495
00:42:18.868 --> 00:42:21.105
I can read your
thoughts. remember?

496
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.543
I'd be more than happy
to read to you.

497
00:42:30.847 --> 00:42:32.850
Come on now.
Hand it over.

498
00:42:42.859 --> 00:42:46.263
Ah... I feel like a new man.

499
00:42:46.296 --> 00:42:47.831
You feel better.

500
00:42:47.864 --> 00:42:50.834
As good as I will get.
I suppose.

501
00:42:50.867 --> 00:42:54.137
Now. I'd put some
solid cash on a wager

502
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.306
that there is a reason
Count Dracula

503
00:42:56.339 --> 00:43:00.010
and the exalted Ramses
rushed to my door

504
00:43:00.043 --> 00:43:02.846
at the appointed hour
of my death.

505
00:43:02.879 --> 00:43:04.982
A zombie sent us.

506
00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:06.316
Come again?

507
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:10.220
Frankenstein is why we are here.

508
00:43:10.253 --> 00:43:12.889
First I heard that name was
when the big guy cut me up.

509
00:43:12.922 --> 00:43:15.359
And you have no clue who he is.

510
00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:17.328
Wish I could help you.

511
00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.398
Obviously. he knew you.

512
00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:26.069
Well. I am reclusive. but
not without some notoriety.

513
00:43:26.102 --> 00:43:28.772
And the thing only
wanted your skin.

514
00:43:28.805 --> 00:43:32.242
Didn't offer an
explanation or nothing.

515
00:43:32.275 --> 00:43:33.977
I'm sorry
we didn't arrive sooner.

516
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.746
save you some trouble.

517
00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.314
I'm happy you showed up at all.

518
00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:39.716
I'd have died if you hadn't.

519
00:43:39.749 --> 00:43:42.686
I'm sure Frankenstein
expected you to.

520
00:43:42.719 --> 00:43:48.392
Listen... No one takes my skin
and walks away with it.

521
00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:52.730
If you're aiming to bury
this guy. I'm in to help big.

522
00:43:54.864 --> 00:43:58.368
So he wanted Ramses' heart.

523
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:02.305
your skin.
and my daughter.

524
00:44:02.338 --> 00:44:04.207
What for?

525
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.110
He's collecting
outsiders like us.

526
00:44:07.143 --> 00:44:10.113
I'm not a fan of that
term personally.

527
00:44:10.146 --> 00:44:12.816
but following that
line of thinking...

528
00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:16.820
Is he done or
will there be others?

529
00:44:16.853 --> 00:44:18.989
Who else is there?

530
00:44:19.022 --> 00:44:23.427
There is one man.

531
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.895
Who?

532
00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:26.263
A beast.

533
00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:29.800
You mean Charles Conliff?

534
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.702
Isn't he dangerous?

535
00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.136
Uh. yeah.

536
00:44:33.169 --> 00:44:35.939
That is why we need him.

537
00:44:35.972 --> 00:44:40.177
If he isn't a target.
then he'll be an ally.

538
00:44:42.145 --> 00:44:44.915
I hope he doesn't hold grudges.
I think I owe him some money.

539
00:44:53.289 --> 00:44:56.493
Today. the butterfly has flown.

540
00:44:56.526 --> 00:45:00.964
but she was not
here to see it fly.

541
00:45:00.997 --> 00:45:04.802
And sorrowing. I wonder why
the empty shell is mine alone.

542
00:45:06.169 --> 00:45:09.873
Perhaps the secret
lies in this.

543
00:45:09.906 --> 00:45:13.276
I. too. found
the chrysalis.

544
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:16.346
and death
that robbed me of delight.

545
00:45:16.379 --> 00:45:19.450
was but the radiant
creature's flight.

546
00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.858
Pretty.

547
00:45:29.325 --> 00:45:32.463
What means?

548
00:45:35.098 --> 00:45:36.933
Well...

549
00:45:36.966 --> 00:45:41.104
the poem is about
a butterfly's chrysalis. yes.

550
00:45:41.137 --> 00:45:45.242
but it's also

551
00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:48.112
about a mother
grieving her dying child.

552
00:45:52.248 --> 00:45:56.787
Sometimes pretty things
can also be sad things.

553
00:45:59.889 --> 00:46:03.093
Like you.

554
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:11.969
Boris. why won't you
let me go?

555
00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.872
Why am I here?

556
00:46:15.905 --> 00:46:18.341
Why?

557
00:46:18.374 --> 00:46:20.944
I am your friend. yes?

558
00:46:20.977 --> 00:46:22.813
Please. tell me.

559
00:46:25.014 --> 00:46:29.586
I won't be mad at you.
but I need to know.

560
00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:33.557
Please. will you tell me?

[Frankenstein laughs.

562
00:46:48.204 --> 00:46:50.107
My father...

563
00:46:53.142 --> 00:46:54.444
You don't need me here.

564
00:46:55.578 --> 00:46:58.482
You need my father's blood.

565
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.385
He was damned by
the devil himself.

566
00:47:02.418 --> 00:47:05.122
and that is the power source
that Frankenstein requires.

567
00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:11.328
When I kill Frankenstein.

568
00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:16.099
I will not even give him the
honor of drinking his blood.

569
00:47:16.132 --> 00:47:19.135
I will let him
spill himself dry.

570
00:47:19.168 --> 00:47:22.206
I will water the roses
with his blood.

571
00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:27.611
I...

572
00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:29.546
FRANKENSTEIN: Boris. come!

573
00:47:33.049 --> 00:47:35.519
I... go.

[shrieks]

575
00:47:46.696 --> 00:47:48.599
It's where you're going.

576
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:53.003
Almost finished.

577
00:47:56.239 --> 00:47:59.476
Now. take this.

578
00:47:59.509 --> 00:48:03.947
I need the arms and the legs.

579
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.282
And the last piece.

580
00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:08.986
Okay.

581
00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:37.580
So now you think
this Frankenstein

582
00:48:37.613 --> 00:48:39.516
wants something from me?

583
00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:42.652
It's a safe bet.
You'd likely be a target.

584
00:48:42.685 --> 00:48:44.587
No one's been here
besides you guys.

585
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.691
Either we beat the devil here.
or we are wrong.

586
00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:50.593
Either way...

587
00:48:50.626 --> 00:48:52.729
You need my help.

588
00:48:52.762 --> 00:48:56.266
Yes. strength in numbers.

589
00:48:56.299 --> 00:48:58.568
So. what's the plan?

590
00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:01.237
Find Frankenstein's
lair. infiltrate it.

591
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:04.741
and get my daughter back.

592
00:49:04.774 --> 00:49:07.544
Personally. I'd like
to skin him a little too.

593
00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:10.180
And rip his heart out.

594
00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:13.616
I got nothing against
this Frankenstein.

595
00:49:13.649 --> 00:49:16.520
But it does sound fun. I'm in.

596
00:49:18.187 --> 00:49:20.156
However. we still
need to find him.

597
00:49:20.189 --> 00:49:22.159
Therein lies the rub.

598
00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:26.363
You smell that?

599
00:49:28.264 --> 00:49:31.001
Smells rank.

601
00:49:33.202 --> 00:49:35.172

the castle defenses all ready.

[grunting]

611
00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:01.391
Did we get him?

612
00:51:09.632 --> 00:51:11.568
We are too late.

613
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:15.072
Poor Charlie.
He took his arms and legs.

614
00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:19.742
He's collecting parts. remember.

615
00:51:19.775 --> 00:51:21.812
What the hell does he
need his arms and legs for?

616
00:51:23.446 --> 00:51:24.914
That remains a mystery.

617
00:51:28.784 --> 00:51:30.387
And he left this.

618
00:51:35.658 --> 00:51:37.360
His hands were probably full.

worked on the bead.

With blood magic.
we can track the owner.

wield blood magic?

I do indeed.

Help him.
Bleed for him.

626
00:52:05.588 --> 00:52:09.792
No.

treats you that way.

I know how you feel.

637
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.686
I sometimes feel like
an accessory to my father.

638
00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:14.724
Just another useless trinket
that he can take notice of

639
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:17.494
whenever it suits him.

640

No. Boris. wait.

641

Stay.

Keep me company.

So. how does that happen?

644
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.764
It's one of the side
effects of lycanthropy.

645
00:53:54.797 --> 00:53:58.868
I can be chopped up to bits
and regrow it all back.

-Ah.

you on the battlefield.

Yes.

664
00:55:11.607 --> 00:55:14.344
And let's hope he's close so
I don't get lightheaded.

665
00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:18.581
Perhaps a drink first
to fortify the blood.

666
00:55:18.614 --> 00:55:19.949
Couldn't hurt.

667
00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.089

Makes sense.

Frankenstein waits for
us in a cemetery?

673
00:56:03.859 --> 00:56:06.763
Plenty of body parts there.
Why is he messing with us?

674
00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:11.401
Well. Highgate cemetery sits at
the foot of Candlewood castle.

675
00:56:11.434 --> 00:56:14.504
Once a stronghold
for the Turks.

676
00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:17.140
He waits for us there.

677
00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:20.076
It won't be easy.

678
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:22.946
I have always said nothing
worth doing is easy.

679
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.917
Then let us not keep
the devil waiting.

You drop it off though.

Fine.

If I tell you something. do you
promise to keep it between us?

01:00:43.105 --> 01:00:46.142
Kill him.
That is the plan.

738
01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.277
Well. okay. sure.

739
01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:49.245
[sniffing]

740
01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.083

742
01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:00.823
Where is Elisabeta?

743
01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:03.926
I show.

744
01:01:03.959 --> 01:01:05.161
We all go.

745
01:01:06.962 --> 01:01:07.930
Alone.

746
01:01:10.265 --> 01:01:12.301
Yeah. so that's
not going to happen.

747
01:01:12.334 --> 01:01:14.704
No. no. we go together.

748
01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.707
Or we resist.

749
01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.044
Griffin. blow a hole in him.

750
01:01:22.377 --> 01:01:24.814
I kicked a hornet's nest once.

751
01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.149
This is what it felt like.

752
01:01:29.985 --> 01:01:31.320
Damn.

753
01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:33.823
Silver bullets deliver
serious stopping power.

754
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:37.393
I... failed.

755
01:01:37.426 --> 01:01:39.028
You did.

756
01:01:47.002 --> 01:01:52.375
My friends. it would appear
that luck is on our side.

757
01:01:54.409 --> 01:01:56.345
But the moon isn't.

758
01:01:56.378 --> 01:01:58.881
Going in without
my wild side. boys.

759
01:02:16.832 --> 01:02:18.300
Something's not right.

-You hear that?

761
01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.810
Frankenstein has studied
the Pharaoh's ways.

762
01:02:27.843 --> 01:02:30.112
Meaning what. exactly?

763
01:02:30.145 --> 01:02:33.449
I believe in this day and age
they call them booby traps.

764
01:02:33.482 --> 01:02:35.952
All right. well.
we find another way.

765
01:02:37.452 --> 01:02:40.422
This is the direct route.

766
01:02:40.455 --> 01:02:41.991
We will not detour.

767
01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.494
Stand back.

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.186

01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.652
Thanks. pal.

786
01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:51.487
It didn't get you?

787
01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.490
We're going to have to rely
on reflexes for this one.

788
01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.392
I got this.

789
01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.193
What if it's silver?

790
01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:01.264
Whatever it is.
it won't touch me.

791
01:05:12.374 --> 01:05:13.676
It should be clear now.

792
01:05:15.143 --> 01:05:16.345
We must hurry.

793
01:05:34.396 --> 01:05:35.464
Wait.

794
01:05:56.084 --> 01:05:59.689
Something tells me we should
not be seen by the mirrors.

795
01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:04.293
I could go. but then again

796
01:06:04.326 --> 01:06:08.230
I'm not altogether transparent
without clothes.

797
01:06:08.263 --> 01:06:11.534
Right. I get it.
My turn.

[footsteps. humming]

This way.

I can smell her.

804
01:06:54.843 --> 01:06:58.047
Smells like a trap.

805
01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.716
What choice is there?

806
01:07:00.749 --> 01:07:03.152
We will go this way.
Meet you at the top.

807
01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.625
Hurry up.
Freezing my biscuits off.

808
01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.763
Father.

809
01:07:14.796 --> 01:07:17.099
Hear me.

810
01:07:17.132 --> 01:07:18.367
Follow my voice.

811
01:07:19.734 --> 01:07:21.103
Father...

812
01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:27.309

You bastard.

816
01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:37.519
Keep them teeth to yourself.

817
01:07:37.552 --> 01:07:39.555
I'm will fight you with every
fiber of my being.

818
01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.223
Oh. yeah. little girl?
Come on.

819
01:07:41.256 --> 01:07:44.259
Get up there.
Get up there.

820
01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:47.096
Your blood will paint a
thousand of my portraits.

821
01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.597
Have a way with words.
don't you?

822
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:50.466
I'll have my way
with your veins.

823
01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:52.901
You better settle down.
Your daddy's on the way.

824
01:07:56.771 --> 01:07:59.175
You will regret having
crossed my path.

825
01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:03.612
Father!

826
01:08:03.645 --> 01:08:05.214
Elisabeta. I'm coming.

827
01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.549
Stop right there.

828
01:08:07.582 --> 01:08:12.488
Frankenstein. I presume.

829
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:15.390
The honor is all mine.

830
01:08:15.423 --> 01:08:19.862
Honor is something you
are in short supply of.

831
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.765
Are you all right?

832
01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:26.635
I'm fine.

833
01:08:26.668 --> 01:08:28.403
Did he hurt you?

834
01:08:28.436 --> 01:08:30.539
He couldn't possibly
hurt me.

835
01:08:30.572 --> 01:08:32.774
I think I probably
could pretty easily.

836
01:08:32.807 --> 01:08:36.145
Stop right there.

837
01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:41.583
You will pay in
excruciating agony

838
01:08:41.616 --> 01:08:44.653
that will feel like centuries

839
01:08:44.686 --> 01:08:48.891
until your heart stops
from sheer panic.

840
01:08:50.458 --> 01:08:53.229
Or you will die screaming.

841
01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:56.499
Not before I take her first.

842
01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.371
Why have you done all this?

843
01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.173
Sit down over there
and I'll let you know.

844
01:09:07.509 --> 01:09:09.344
I refuse.

845
01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:11.380
Then she dies.

846
01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.714
Sit in that chair.

847
01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:14.583
and we can have
a civilized conversation.

848
01:09:14.616 --> 01:09:16.185
Do it now.

849
01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:19.788
Get over there.

850
01:09:20.855 --> 01:09:22.224
Very well.

851
01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:45.280
What is this?

852
01:09:45.313 --> 01:09:47.650
The key to my new life.

If the goddess Hathor
guides my ears correctly.

856
01:10:07.402 --> 01:10:09.304
the voices came from down here.

857
01:10:09.337 --> 01:10:10.906
How can you be sure?

858
01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:12.975
Yeah. it's like an
echo chamber in here.

859
01:10:16.811 --> 01:10:17.846
Vibrations...

860
01:10:19.748 --> 01:10:21.650
Was not he dead?

861
01:10:21.683 --> 01:10:23.385
Hey. where's Frankenstein?

862
01:10:23.418 --> 01:10:24.987
Sorry.

863
01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.256
Yeah. we're gonna need
a little bit more than that.

864
01:10:30.792 --> 01:10:33.729
I wasn't expecting him to run.

865
01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:34.763
Do we go after him?

866
01:10:47.909 --> 01:10:48.911
Tell me.

867
01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.915
Why?

868
01:10:53.948 --> 01:10:55.884
Because I'm dying.

869
01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:59.454
My body's giving up on me.

870
01:10:59.487 --> 01:11:03.625
So. you are collecting pieces

871
01:11:03.658 --> 01:11:09.398
to create a new
body for yourself.

872
01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:11.933
That's correct.

873
01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:14.403
I'll make a new body...

874
01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:18.040
out of all the greatest
monsters that ever lived.

875
01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:21.910
It will not work.

876
01:11:21.943 --> 01:11:24.980
You are not God.

877
01:11:25.013 --> 01:11:28.450
[chuckles]
I'm close to it.

878
01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:30.052
You...

879
01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.356
You're closer to meeting God
than becoming him.

880
01:11:37.692 --> 01:11:39.361
Friend.

881
01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:40.662

Please!

Hey. hey. hey.

883
01:11:43.064 --> 01:11:44.500
This is not about you.

884
01:11:50.438 --> 01:11:52.774
Hurt her?

885
01:11:52.807 --> 01:11:54.743
Yes! Please. Boris. he hurt me.

Please. get me free.

01:11:56.611 --> 01:12:00.115
Don't listen to her.
She can't even feel any pain.

888
01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:01.583
Let me finish this.

889
01:12:01.616 --> 01:12:02.984
Boris. he's going to kill me.

890
01:12:03.017 --> 01:12:04.353
Back off.

891
01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:07.622
You break promise.

892
01:12:07.655 --> 01:12:11.026
I break no promise.

893
01:12:11.059 --> 01:12:12.561
Stop listening to her.

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:20.068
It's too late.

01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:21.670
It's too late for all of you.

You're all going to die.

897
01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.381

You've all come.

903
01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:58.106
You've got friends
in low places.

904
01:12:58.139 --> 01:13:02.411
Why... kill?

905
01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.913
Boris. I feel like I should
say that I'm sorry.

906
01:13:04.946 --> 01:13:06.648
but he was going to kill us.

907
01:13:10.218 --> 01:13:12.921
Wait.

908
01:13:12.954 --> 01:13:14.089
I'm sensing something.

that blanket.

912
01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:39.081

917
01:14:11.179 --> 01:14:12.881
I got this.

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:48.584
Boris...

923
01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.086
Father hurt.

924
01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:07.202
Father hurt.

925
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:11.039
I know.

926
01:15:11.072 --> 01:15:14.276
You have to believe me when I
say he does not care for you.

927
01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:16.879
I'm sorry. Boris.
but it's the truth.

928
01:15:19.013 --> 01:15:21.616
Friend... good.

929
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:22.918
Yes. good.

930
01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:30.792
Frankenstein is going
to destroy the village

931
01:15:30.825 --> 01:15:33.094
if we don't hurry up.

932
01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:36.164
Join us. Help us.

933
01:15:36.197 --> 01:15:39.200
If that thing is the sum
of all of our parts.

934
01:15:39.233 --> 01:15:41.336
this fight ain't
going to be easy.

935
01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:43.638
Not to mention
it's the size of a building.

936
01:15:43.671 --> 01:15:45.941
If it has the best of us.
it has the worst of us.

937
01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:48.310
Our weaknesses.

938
01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:50.211
Yes. but it still has my heart.

939
01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:52.347
That may be too great
of a challenge.

940
01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.249
even for all of
our efforts combined.

941
01:15:55.683 --> 01:15:57.185
Easy is boring.

942
01:15:57.218 --> 01:15:58.787
Let's kill this thing.

943
01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:03.091
[thunder]

944
01:16:03.124 --> 01:16:05.661
[roaring]

945
01:16:16.137 --> 01:16:18.840
As long as it has my heart.
it is invulnerable.

946
01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:21.610
So a giant immortal.
Great.

947
01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:23.011
We're going to need
something bigger.

948
01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:35.591
Father. you're alive.

949
01:16:41.796 --> 01:16:43.365
I am revived. child.

950
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:49.404
Ramses. you said that once
the heart is taken out.

951
01:16:49.437 --> 01:16:51.272
the magic goes with it.

952
01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:53.341
Yes.

953
01:16:53.374 --> 01:16:57.946
But like you said. we're going
to need something bigger.

954
01:16:57.979 --> 01:17:00.982
Mother always said your pride
would lead to your death.

955
01:17:01.015 --> 01:17:05.087
She was wise.
but not always fair.

956
01:17:06.988 --> 01:17:11.326
Leave this to me. and I will
drag this thing back to hell.

957
01:17:23.971 --> 01:17:25.040
[roaring]

958
01:17:27.008 --> 01:17:28.910
I wasn't expecting him
to do that.

959
01:17:34.882 --> 01:17:36.184
[screaming]

960
01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:58.673
[roaring]

961
01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.312
We have to help him somehow.

962
01:18:04.345 --> 01:18:06.748
There's nothing more we can do.

963
01:18:06.781 --> 01:18:08.417
It's up to Dracula now.

964
01:18:11.986 --> 01:18:13.422
[screaming]

965
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.996
My father doesn't stand
a chance against that thing.

966
01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:23.932
Especially if it
can heal like Charles.

967
01:18:31.105 --> 01:18:32.741
[roars]

968
01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.747
Father!

969
01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.148
They're coming this way.

970
01:18:40.181 --> 01:18:41.249
[growls]

971
01:18:51.492 --> 01:18:53.795
It's weakening.

972
01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:55.096
If we can keep it on the ground.

973
01:18:55.129 --> 01:18:57.799
we may be able to
carve its heart out.

974
01:18:57.832 --> 01:18:59.367
I'm up to the task.

975
01:19:14.982 --> 01:19:16.951
It's going to kill him!

976
01:19:16.984 --> 01:19:18.220
We have to do something.

977
01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.228
I... hammer!

978
01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.798
[grunts]

979
01:19:33.167 --> 01:19:34.336
Hit him again!

980
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.009
[roars]

981
01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.978
There!
That's his chance!

982
01:19:58.226 --> 01:19:59.427
Run!

983
01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:23.952
Rest in pieces. Frankenstein.

984
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.896
Here we go.

985
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.301
Here we are.

986
01:20:40.334 --> 01:20:42.503
What do you look like
under those bandages?

987
01:20:42.536 --> 01:20:44.005
Want to find out?

988
01:20:44.038 --> 01:20:47.141
I am engaged to be wed. sir.

989
01:20:47.174 --> 01:20:48.109
Thanks to you.

990
01:20:51.245 --> 01:20:52.547
You ordered milk?

991
01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.482
Correction. goat's milk.

992
01:20:54.515 --> 01:20:56.117
It's good for the skin.

993
01:20:57.585 --> 01:21:00.188
What's wrong?
You look nervous.

994
01:21:00.221 --> 01:21:01.522
Nervous?

995
01:21:01.555 --> 01:21:03.959
Hey boy. you ever
been drunk before?

996
01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:07.462
Oh. it's wonderful.

997
01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.931
Cures nervousness.

998
01:21:09.964 --> 01:21:11.199
This will fix you right up.

999
01:21:13.634 --> 01:21:15.303
Come on. there you go.

1000
01:21:19.273 --> 01:21:20.975
Good.

1001
01:21:21.008 --> 01:21:23.044
Damn right. it's good.

1002
01:21:23.077 --> 01:21:25.146
That's right. down the hatch.

1003
01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:31.386
I heard you sought
out the cure once.

1004
01:21:33.354 --> 01:21:35.523
I did.

1005
01:21:35.556 --> 01:21:37.025
I was lost.

1006
01:21:38.592 --> 01:21:39.627
But now I'm found.

1007
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.062
[Boris belches]

1008
01:21:46.133 --> 01:21:51.139
Despite my outward
behavior... you know.

1009
01:21:52.506 --> 01:21:53.441
I know.

1010
01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:00.281
Pity it took a madman
to bring you all together.

1011
01:22:00.314 --> 01:22:03.451
You all have so much in common.

1012
01:22:03.484 --> 01:22:07.455
Things like us always
hide in the shadows.

1013
01:22:07.488 --> 01:22:10.058
Well. maybe we
should change that.

1014
01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.428
You do realize we kind of
saved the world. right?

1015
01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.129
We're like heroes.

1016
01:22:15.162 --> 01:22:18.066
No. no.
Let's not make a habit of this.

1017
01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.635
I disagree.

1018
01:22:20.668 --> 01:22:22.170
I think it suits us.

1019
01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:25.073
I propose a toast.

1020
01:22:28.142 --> 01:22:31.479
Here now. we gather as friends.

1021
01:22:31.512 --> 01:22:35.583
Yesterday. we were apart.

1022
01:22:35.616 --> 01:22:39.354
And tomorrow.
we may never meet again.

1023
01:22:42.289 --> 01:22:45.493
But here. in this moment.

1024
01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:49.631
we are together and safe.

1025
01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:57.038
It is rare. but tonight.
my heart is full.

1026
01:22:57.071 --> 01:23:00.475
I've lived for centuries.
and yet today.

1027
01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:04.212
I discover kinship.

1028
01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:08.183
I thank you. and I honor you.

1029
01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:14.455
And with that. I propose a toast

1030
01:23:14.488 --> 01:23:17.993
to heroes and old friends.

1031
01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.429
And new beginnings.

1032
01:25:04.231 --> 01:25:08.302
FRANKENSTEIN : To a new era...
of gods and monsters.

1033
01:25:08.335 --> 01:25:11.239
[Frankenstein laughs]
