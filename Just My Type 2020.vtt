Hey Vanessa. do you have
a minute?

16
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.195
Sure.

17
00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:09.156
I'm allotting space
for the next issue.

18
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:11.027
Do you have enough
to fill four columns?

19
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.854
Yeah. I think so.

20
00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:13.160
It shouldn't be a problem.

21
00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:14.813
And when should I expect
a draft?

22
00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:17.555
I'm putting finishing touches
on probably end of day tomorrow.

23
00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.296
Great. Early as usual.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.993

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:22.560
Uh. yeah.

26
00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.867
So it's a lifestyle piece on
the exploding yoga industry.

27
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.651
Hot yoga. cold yoga. goat yoga.

28
00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.654
But really. it's an examination
of transitory communities

29
00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:31.047
in modern culture.

30
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.092

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:33.571
Remember your audience.

32
00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:36.139
They want to know the trends
and where to find them.

33
00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:39.534
Our job is either reporting
on pop culture or creating it.

34
00:01:39.577 --> 00:01:40.665
Got it.

35
00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:41.927
I appreciate your drive.
Vanessa.

which is why I wanted
to talk to you.

Nancy's moving to Los Angeles
to open a California office.

38
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.847
and we're going to need someone
to take over her position

39
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.545
as senior lifestyle editor.

40
00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:53.722
Oh. well I happen to know
the perfect person.

41
00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.767
We're considering several people
in house.

42
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.422
but I just wanted to let
you know you're in the mix.

43
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.945
Great.

44
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.033
A lot of weight will be given
to each candidate's work

45
00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:02.470
on this next issue.

46
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:04.167
so let's hope your yoga thing
blows everyone away.

47
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.517
Well. I feel more than up
for the challenge.

48
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:07.518
Thank you.

49
00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:09.912
Goat yoga.
That's really a thing?

50
00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.522
Yeah.

51
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:12.915
It's like regular yoga. but
goats climb on you like trees.

52
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.264
That can't be good.

53
00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.571
Oh. I almost forgot.

54
00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:18.660
Stacey and I are having a little
get together this weekend.

55
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:20.140
Why don't you and Jack stop by?

56
00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:23.926
Um. Jack and I are
no longer together.

57
00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.885
It's okay. it's...
it's for the best.

I mean. don't you really just
pick somebody and make it work?

61
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.290
Hm.

62
00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:43.250
Can you make it work if it's not
the right person. though?

63
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.169
Now reach for the sky...
hold.

64
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:52.389
Keep holding.

65
00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.043

It's research.

Okay. don't turn around.

75
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.369

but great. great class.

How long you been seeing
each other?

I mean. we broke up a while ago.

106
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.766
It shouldn't still bother me.
but I guess I just wasn't ready

107
00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.333
to see him with somebody else.

108
00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:07.986
The right one is out there.

109
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.119
You just have to keep doing what
you're doing and focus on you.

110
00:04:10.162 --> 00:04:11.686
Yeah.

111
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.296
I mean. god knows I've got
enough to focus on with work.

112
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.732
How is work. by the way?

113
00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:16.908

for a huge promotion.

00:04:16.952 --> 00:04:17.692

117
00:04:18.997 --> 00:04:19.781

118
00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:20.608

119
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:21.609
Okay. what's the job?

120
00:04:21.652 --> 00:04:23.088
It's senior lifestyle editor.

121
00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:24.307
I'd have a lot
more responsibility.

122
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.787
a lot more autonomy.

123
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.615

that have more substance.

125
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:31.009

not to take you.

what I really think you need?

129
00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:37.929
I mean. when was the last time
you took some time away

130
00:04:37.973 --> 00:04:39.844
to just relax and recharge?

131
00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:41.237
When do I have time?

132
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.194
Okay. look.

133
00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:43.631
I'm going away this weekend.

134
00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:45.154
and I'm going to my parents'
bed and breakfast

135
00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:46.721
up at Thomson Lake.

136
00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:48.984
It's in this adorable little
town in upstate Washington.

137
00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:52.074
and it is so. so beautiful
this time of year.

138
00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.294
And the season for them doesn't
kick off until Founder's Day.

139
00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:56.252
so they have no guests
until then.

140
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.734
It's simple. but it's
the perfect place to unwind.

141
00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:02.780
and it would just be you and me.
and the fresh spring air.

142
00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:04.173
It'll be fun.

143
00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:05.435
I'm really not sure I should
take off right now.

144
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.437
All you do is work.
You work all the time.

145
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.744
I know. but it's bad timing
right now.

146
00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:12.399
And you say that all the time.

147
00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:13.704
I have to work
for this promotion.

148
00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:14.836
You'll just be away
for the weekend

149
00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.882
and you'll come back on Monday.

150
00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:21.973
Well. I did tell my boss
I'd be done writing tomorrow.

151
00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:22.800
Okay. let's do it.

152

Clayborne pumping our gas?

170
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.292
Wait. who's Martin Clayborne?

171

The man pumping our gas.

172
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.774
How do you know the name
of the guy pumping our gas?

173
00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:24.906
Because he's a famous writer.

174
00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.212
He's the master of mystery.

175
00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:29.911
Why would the master of mystery
be pumping our gas?

How do you know that it's him?

178

00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:41.879
Look at that.

184
00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:44.404
That's a dog.

185
00:06:44.447 --> 00:06:46.406
That. that is his dog. Ernie!

186
00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.670
Wait. how do you know
the name of his dog?

187
00:06:49.713 --> 00:06:52.847
All Clayborne fans know Ernie.

188
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.587
I'll go talk to him.

189
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.936
No. don't. don't. don't!

190
00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.328
What are you going to say?

191
00:06:56.372 --> 00:06:58.374
I'm. first. going to apologize
for mistaking him

192
00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.984
for being our gas attendant.

193
00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:01.986
and then I'm going to ask him
to sign your book.

194
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.988
No. no. no. I don't want
to be that person.

195
00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:05.903
You know the name of his dog.

196
00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:07.557
You already are that person.

197
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:09.733
No I'm not. I'm not
a crazy fan.

198
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:10.821
A little bit.

199
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:11.953
No. I only went
to one book signing.

200
00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:13.215
You said you went to a few.

201
00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:16.305
All right. uh. anything else
I can do for ya?

202
00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:17.611
Change the oil?

203
00:07:17.654 --> 00:07:20.265
[forced laughing]

204
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:21.876
No. we're good.
Thank you.

205
00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.791
Yeah. uh. my friend thinks that
you're her favourite writer

206
00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:25.270
and she wants you to sign
her book.

207
00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:29.100
You look a lot like him.

208
00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.754
Let me guess.

209
00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:32.887
Martin Clayborne.

210
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.931
Yeah.

211
00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:36.020
Yeah. I get that a lot.

212
00:07:36.064 --> 00:07:37.544
But no. sorry.

213
00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:38.632
Oh.

214
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:42.418
Anyway. uh. if there's nothing
else I can do for you...

215
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.811
Sorry about the
misunderstanding.

216
00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:45.160
No worries at all.

217
00:07:47.162 --> 00:07:48.206
Hey Martin!

218
00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:50.818
What was it?

219
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:51.732
It's a problem
with the alternator.

220
00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:52.689
Ahh.

221
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.517
Why did he lie?

222
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:55.910
You don't understand.

223
00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:57.215
He's like the J.D. Salinger
of mystery writers.

224
00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:58.565
He's sold millions of books.

225
00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:00.654
he's got fans all over
the world.

226
00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:03.439
And five years ago.
he just disappeared.

227
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.441
I mean. I had heard rumours
he was out west. but...

228
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.398
Is he still writing?

229
00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:07.399
Yeah. he still writes.

230
00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:08.400
He's more popular than ever.

231
00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:09.706
I see you really are a fan.

232
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.142
I am.

233
00:08:11.186 --> 00:08:12.927
Yeah. his early books inspired
me to write my own.

234
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.016
Uh. you wrote a book?

235
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:16.626
Yeah. well I didn't wri...

236
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.672
No. actually I didn't. I wrote
a few chapters. and then...

237
00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:20.064
Why didn't I know about this?

238
00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:22.240
Because it's not even
worth mentioning?

239
00:08:22.284 --> 00:08:24.721
If my best friend writes a book.
it's worth mentioning.

240
00:08:24.765 --> 00:08:27.202
It's a pipe dream
that I had years ago.

241
00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:29.204
No. I had no idea.

242
00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:30.422
Yeah.

243
00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:33.034
Okay. Well this conversation
is not over.

244
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.565
And here we are.

245
00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:43.784
Aww.

246
00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:51.313
Oh. I love it here.

247
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:01.279

Hey!

00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:07.547
This is Vanessa.

Hi.

Hi.

Oh my gosh. so nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

I've heard so much about
you guys.

Thank you.

00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:18.035
Aww. I'm really looking forward
to this.

261
00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:20.429
Well then. let's...
let's get you settled in.

262
00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:20.995
Okay.

263
00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:22.170
- May I?
- Sure.

264
00:09:22.213 --> 00:09:22.823
Thank you.

265
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:23.911
Such a gentleman.

[whispering]

267
00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:26.653
Well. I hope you'll be
comfortable in here.

268
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.655
Oh my gosh. this
is so beautiful.

Uh. TV's. um...

271
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.616
There's a whole bunch of books

272
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.009
and board games
down in the lobby.

273
00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:36.445
Even better.
Thank you.

274
00:09:36.488 --> 00:09:37.359
You guys hungry?

275
00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:38.447
[Both] Yes!

276
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.230
Great. I'll whip
you up something.

277
00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:40.101
Make yourselves at home.

278
00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:40.971
Okay.

279
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.195
[door opens]

[gasps]

281
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.589
You should interview Martin
for the magazine.

282
00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:50.764
You scared me!

283
00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:52.026
I'm sorry.

284
00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:54.071
I know I should've knocked.

285
00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:57.118
but I was just too excited
by my brilliant idea.

286
00:09:57.161 --> 00:09:58.510
What am I. what am I
supposed to do?

287
00:09:58.554 --> 00:10:00.338
Just go and knock on his door
wherever that is

288
00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:01.775
and say "hi. you don't know me.

289
00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:03.951
but I'd like you to grant me
your only interview

290
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:05.256
in the last five years."

291
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.693
Yes.

292
00:10:06.736 --> 00:10:08.216
Wait. why doesn't he
do interviews?

293
00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:10.174
Because he doesn't do any
press or public appearances.

294
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:11.828
Well. he needs to get over that.

295
00:10:11.872 --> 00:10:14.918
Okay. I love your enthusiasm.
but you are clearly delirious.

296
00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.093
you need to go to sleep.

297
00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:18.052
Okay. But this discussion
isn't over.

298
00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:18.922
Okay?

299
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:19.749
Get outta here.

00:10:19.793 --> 00:10:21.142

00:10:32.414 --> 00:10:34.764
Okay. what is stopping you?

303
00:10:34.808 --> 00:10:37.549
Well for starters I wouldn't
know where to find him.

304
00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:39.726
All right. well
then let's review.

305
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:42.511
He's on a first-name basis
with the gas station attendant.

306
00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:44.034
which tells us he's a local.

307
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:47.081
I'm a journalist. I know how
to find him if I want to.

308
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:48.952
Look. I want to respect
his privacy. okay?

309
00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:53.348
Mom. do you know any famous
writers that live in the area?

Oh. we've got two.

00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:58.092
There's Earl Harper who does
the monthly newsletter.

312
00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:02.444
and then there's Marty
who lives up by the lake.

313
00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:04.620
You guys know Martin Clayborne?

314
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.969
Of course we do.

315
00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:07.536
I mean. we know all
the residents around here.

316
00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:08.711
I mean. it's funny
you should mention him.

317
00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:11.714
because we actually have
a package for him

318
00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.673
that was delivered to us
by mistake.

319
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.979
You're welcome to take it
up there if you like.

320
00:11:16.023 --> 00:11:18.895
Oh gee. I'd love that.
That would be amazing.

Who knew!

324
00:11:23.117 --> 00:11:24.640
I prefer reading
Westerns myself.

325
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.729
but I hear he's a pretty
good writer.

326
00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:28.339
Yeah. he's amazing.
He's the best.

327
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:30.646
He's actually.
he's a famous recluse.

328
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.648
So it's wild that I found
him up here.

329
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.519
and your daughter.
who I love like a sister.

330
00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:36.130
thinks I should interview him.

331
00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:38.349
Oh. well he's always been very
friendly to Stanley and me.

Celebration every year.

334
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:45.356
But other than that he's pretty
private and we don't pry.

335
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.055

"don't stick your nose in other
people's business."

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.450

in his younger days.

a heads up.

I just got out of a meeting
with the editors.

353
00:12:17.562 --> 00:12:19.651
and it looks like they're
leaning towards

354
00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:21.479
another candidate for the job.

355
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:22.742
Did they say why?

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.569

landed some...

but save it for later.

the promotion is probably mine.

hasn't agreed to anything yet.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.114
Well. then you'll want
to accessorize.

544
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.725
Hey. thanks for being
on my side.

545
00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:23.510
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you?

546
00:19:23.553 --> 00:19:25.251
Yes. I'm going to be fine.
This is great.

547
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:26.643
I've got my phone.

548
00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:28.254
I will text you when I'm ready
to get picked up.

549
00:19:28.297 --> 00:19:29.342
Wish me luck.

550
00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:30.299
I'm going to go catch
a big fish.

551
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:31.648
Wow.

552
00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:33.215
I'm going boldly.

553
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.827
I'm starting to wish you had
a different motto!

554
00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:49.536
Hey.

555
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.364
Hey... Vanessa.

556
00:19:51.407 --> 00:19:52.452
What are the odds?

557
00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:54.062
[laughs]

558
00:19:54.105 --> 00:19:55.455
Mind if I join you?

559
00:19:55.498 --> 00:19:57.413
Sure. sure.
Why not?

560
00:19:57.457 --> 00:19:58.501
Great.

561
00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:02.897
What are you fishing for?

562
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.246
Uh...

563
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.118
What am I fishing for?
That's a good question.

564
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.948
Really good question.

565
00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:14.604
Okay. You want to get back
to me on that?

566
00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:15.692
[laughs uncomfortably]

567
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:16.954
You're funny.

568
00:20:16.998 --> 00:20:18.913
Nah. I'm going to... uh...

569
00:20:18.956 --> 00:20:21.742
I'm going to fish for
catfish today.

570
00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:22.786
Wow. catfish.

571
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.223
Yeah. yeah.

572
00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:27.138
Wow. I didn't know that this
lake even had catfish.

573
00:20:27.182 --> 00:20:28.923
Oh yeah. yeah.

574
00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:30.054
Lots of 'em.

575
00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:32.361
I'm gonna catch 'em.

576
00:20:32.405 --> 00:20:34.145
[laughs awkwardly]

577
00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:36.670
- Okay.
- Okay.

578
00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:39.020
So what do you plan to use
for the catfish?

579
00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:40.282
What am I gonna use?

580
00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:41.370
You hear that. Ernie?

581
00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:42.980
He wants to know
what I'm going to use.

582
00:20:43.024 --> 00:20:46.201
I mean my... my fishing pole.
of course.

583
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:47.811
Uh. no. no.

584
00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:51.075
I meant what... what type of
bait are you going to use?

585
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:51.946
A jig?

586
00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:55.297
Spinner bait? Sinker?

587
00:20:55.341 --> 00:20:57.386
Yeah. I mean probably
just one of each

588
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.388
and just really increase
my odds.

589
00:20:59.432 --> 00:21:00.998
- Hmm. yeah.
- Yeah.

590
00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:01.695
No. of course. of course.

591
00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:02.391
That makes sense.

592
00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:03.131
Feeling that?

593
00:21:03.174 --> 00:21:03.697
Mm-hmm.

594
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.874
All right. Okay.

595
00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:08.876
So... well. that's
pretty good.

596
00:21:08.919 --> 00:21:11.052
Here we go.
Here it goes.

597
00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:12.662
Okay.

598
00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:17.928
I think you have
to release the bail

599
00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:18.973
in order for that to...

600
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:20.583
Yeah. yeah.

601
00:21:20.627 --> 00:21:23.325
No. no. I um. I like to do some
practice throws before I uh...

602
00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:24.718
Really get going.

603
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:25.371
So.

604
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:26.633
Yeah. no. no. no.

605
00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:28.243
Oh!

606
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.549
Jeez.

607
00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:32.203
Yeah. Maybe I should
just help you.

608
00:21:32.247 --> 00:21:33.379
Don't... careful.

609
00:21:33.422 --> 00:21:34.205
Okay.

610
00:21:34.249 --> 00:21:34.771
Careful.

611
00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:35.990
Okay.

612
00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:37.818
Okay.

613
00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:42.126
[laughs]

614
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.214
Sorry.

615
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:45.695
There we go.

616
00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.218
Thank you.

617
00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:48.219
You're off the hook.

618
00:21:48.263 --> 00:21:49.873
[laughs]

619
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:52.485
I should probably
get going anyway.

620
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:54.574
Yeah. you're going to go?

621
00:21:54.617 --> 00:21:55.792
I have some work to do.

622
00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:58.012
Yeah. me too.
I work.

623
00:21:58.055 --> 00:21:59.927
Actually. I should probably
get some work done too.

624
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.667
Ah. I should go.

625
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.625
You're right.

626
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:04.975
Really? You just got here.

627
00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.847
Yeah. but I've had
a long morning

628
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.501
and the fish aren't really
biting today.

629
00:22:08.544 --> 00:22:09.893
You know?

630
00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:11.025
Okay. great.

631
00:22:11.068 --> 00:22:11.939
Well.

632
00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:13.506
Yeah. I'll just call my ride.

633
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:15.899
Oh.

634
00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:18.380
Okay.

635
00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:19.773
[exhales]

636
00:22:19.816 --> 00:22:21.688
Oh no.

637
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:24.430
What are... what are you doing?

638
00:22:24.473 --> 00:22:26.562
I'm trying to get some service.

639
00:22:26.606 --> 00:22:29.652
I don't have any reception.

640
00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:31.393
It's okay.

641
00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:32.307
You know... she'll.
she'll probably just come
looking for me.

642
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.309
my friend. if I don't come back.

643
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.136
[barks]

644
00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:36.485
Ernie! Let's go.

645
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:38.618
- Hey. hey.
- Ernie.

646
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:40.707
Buddy. Aw. you're cute.

647
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.447
Ernie.

648
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.013
Hi buddy.

649
00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:44.624
I guess he likes me.

650
00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:45.842
Hey bud. hi!

651
00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:47.322
[sighs]
All right.

652
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.150
Ernie has spoken.

653
00:22:49.193 --> 00:22:53.763
I have to go into town
anyway. so...

654
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:55.504
I will give you a ride.

655
00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:56.853
Great. okay.

656
00:22:56.897 --> 00:22:57.680
Thanks.

657
00:22:57.724 --> 00:22:59.290
Follow me.

658
00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:03.860
Okay. okay. okay.

659
00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:07.168
So uhh. look.

660
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:11.128
This will just take a second.
but uh. make yourself at home.

661
00:23:11.172 --> 00:23:13.217
Just not too at home.

662
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.743
Really thought you could
pass yourself off

663
00:23:16.786 --> 00:23:17.787
as a fisherman. huh?

664
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:20.660
Fisherwoman.
thank you very much.

665
00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:25.229
I just was excited to talk
to my favourite author.

666
00:23:25.273 --> 00:23:26.840
Well. I'm flattered.

667
00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:30.670
But last time I opened up my
personal life to a journalist.

668
00:23:30.713 --> 00:23:35.022
let's just say.
it didn't end well.

669
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:36.893
Yeah. I know.

670
00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:38.982
I know what interview
you're talking about.

671
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:42.333
And it didn't paint you
in the best light.

672
00:23:42.377 --> 00:23:44.118
But don't you think this
would be a great chance to.

673
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:47.121
you know. set
the record straight?

674
00:23:47.164 --> 00:23:50.603
Look. I am done caring about
what people think of me.

675
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:53.649
Wow. must be nice.

676
00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:55.651
You don't think it's valuable
to connect with your fans?

677
00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:57.914
Let them know where you've been.
how you live.

678
00:23:57.958 --> 00:23:59.525
what makes you tick?

679
00:23:59.568 --> 00:24:02.049
I can't tell you what comfort
your books have brought me.

680
00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:04.443
They've inspired me.

681
00:24:07.837 --> 00:24:11.188
Look. I'm just a regular guy.

682
00:24:11.232 --> 00:24:15.192
I ride my horses. I help out
at the town hall meeting.

683
00:24:15.236 --> 00:24:19.501
I fish in the mornings.
actually fish.

684
00:24:19.545 --> 00:24:22.591
I just try and be a good
neighbour. okay?

685
00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:25.812
That's about it.

686
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:28.031
I think there's more to you
than that.

687
00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:36.866
Which one?

688
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.737
Which one what?

689
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.652
Which book inspired you?

690
00:24:39.695 --> 00:24:42.524
Well. "Burden of Proof"
was the game-changer.

691
00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:44.657
And I loved "The Case of the Blue Rose."

692
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.355
I am really enjoying "Circumstantial Evidence."

693
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:50.445
Good. Good.

694
00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:52.273
Good to know.

695
00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:54.797
Maybe you do care
what people think.

696
00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:58.584
We should get going.

697
00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:00.542
I'm sure your friend is
wondering where you are.

698
00:25:00.586 --> 00:25:01.891
Yeah. yeah. I'm sure she is.

699
00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:03.023
You sure it's not
too much trouble?

700
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:04.241
I guess I could call a...

701
00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:05.547
Ask me again I'm going
to change my mind.

702
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:06.853
[laughs]

703
00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:07.723
Yeah. but then you'd be stuck
here with me.

704
00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:09.246
That's a good point.

705
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.770
Bye. Ernie!

706
00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:12.162
[barks]

707
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.519
Thank you for the ride.

708
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:23.043
Hope I didn't completely
ruin your day.

709
00:25:23.086 --> 00:25:26.829
It was definitely entertaining.

710
00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:29.092
I'd like to continue
our conversation.

711
00:25:29.615 --> 00:25:34.707
Look. I wish I could help you.
but the answer's still no.

712
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.447
Sorry.

713
00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:37.536
Yeah.

714
00:25:40.277 --> 00:25:47.371
[phone rings]

715
00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:48.547
Hi Peter.

716
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.896
I just wanted to check in
and see how

717
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:51.245
the article's coming along.

718
00:25:51.288 --> 00:25:52.899
Is he as difficult
as people say?

719
00:25:52.942 --> 00:25:54.204
You know what?
Don't tell me.

720
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.379
I'll wait till I read a draft.

721
00:25:55.423 --> 00:25:56.598
Uh. listen Peter.

722
00:25:56.642 --> 00:25:58.078
I... I have something
I have to tell you.

723
00:25:58.121 --> 00:25:59.514
Oh. before I forget.
I wanted to tell you

724
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.385
about my meeting
with Jerry in ad sales.

725
00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:02.996
He's already sold
two full-page ads

726
00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:05.085
based on this
Clayborne interview.

727
00:26:05.128 --> 00:26:07.261
Vanessa. I think this could
be one of our biggest sellers.

728
00:26:07.304 --> 00:26:09.524
so I'm clearing some serious
space for you.

729
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:11.526
I'm giving you 10 columns.

730
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.790
10 columns? Wow.

731
00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.618
And I'm going to see if
we can get Franco to do

732
00:26:16.662 --> 00:26:18.315
the accompanying photo spread
and cover shot.

733
00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:20.883
Now keep in mind. we're up
against an aggressive deadline.

734
00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:22.015
But I'm sorry. I cut you off.

735
00:26:22.058 --> 00:26:23.016
You were going to tell
me something.

736
00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.844
Right. Right. um.

737
00:26:24.887 --> 00:26:30.371
I... I uh. I wanted to tell
you that um...

738
00:26:30.414 --> 00:26:32.329
I need more time.

739
00:26:32.373 --> 00:26:34.505
I'm going to stay
for an extra week.

740
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:36.464
Well. that's pushing it
a little.

741
00:26:36.507 --> 00:26:38.422
but I trust you'll get there.

742
00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:40.424
I'm really proud of you.
Vanessa.

743
00:26:40.468 --> 00:26:43.079
If I told you when I first hired
you that in a few short years

744
00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:45.212
you'd be doing an authorized
cover story

745
00:26:45.255 --> 00:26:47.431
on one of the best-selling
authors in the world.

746
00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:49.477
what would you say?

747
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.435
I'd have said you were crazy.

748
00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.654
Keep up the good work.

749
00:26:52.698 --> 00:26:53.916
I'll check in with you later.

750
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.004
Okay.

751
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:56.527
Goodnight. Peter.

752
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:01.010
[whispers] You're going
to get fired.

753
00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:08.539
[sighs]

754
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:12.413
The good news is.
you bought some time.

755
00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:14.502
We'll figure something out.

756
00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:16.939
Babe. let's face it.
I am sunk.

757
00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:19.899
And what are you girls
up to today?

758
00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:22.336
We're going to go into town.
do a little shopping.

759
00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:24.207
maybe some plotting.

760
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:25.774
How about you two?

761
00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:28.734
I'm going to put a fresh coat
of paint on the back room.

762
00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:30.170
Founder's Weekend is coming up

763
00:27:30.213 --> 00:27:32.433
and we need as much space
as possible.

764
00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:33.521
[laughs]

765
00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:36.306
I'm off to the town
hall meeting.

766
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.699
Can we come?

767
00:27:37.743 --> 00:27:39.135
Well. sure.

768
00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:41.616
I can't promise you it's going
to be very exciting.

769
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.011
Oh. I think it will be.

770
00:27:46.012 --> 00:27:47.666
[laughs]

771
00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:52.714
All in favour of moving Taco
Tuesday to Wednesday next week

772
00:27:52.758 --> 00:27:55.804
to avoid conflict with Movie
in the Park Night?

773
00:27:57.763 --> 00:27:59.634
Okay.

774
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.592
Those opposed?

775
00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.376
No.

776
00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:03.725
Duly noted. Gus.

777
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:05.945
Next item on the agenda
is in fact

778
00:28:05.988 --> 00:28:07.468
the Founder's Day Celebration.

779
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:08.861
I'm going to turn this
over to Martin

780
00:28:08.904 --> 00:28:11.820
because he. once again.
is serving as the head

781
00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:12.821
of the organizing committee.

782
00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:13.866
So it's all yours. sir.

783
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:15.215
Thank you. Stanley.

784
00:28:15.258 --> 00:28:17.260
Um. well. it's shaping up
to be another great

785
00:28:17.304 --> 00:28:19.306
Founder's Day Celebration
this year.

786
00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:21.961
What is this Founder's Day
everybody's talking about?

787
00:28:22.004 --> 00:28:24.746
It's this big celebration
of how the town came to be.

788
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.923
There's like food. dancing.
it's a whole big thing.

789
00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:30.491
Now. we do need help
with the raffle.

790
00:28:30.534 --> 00:28:33.276
So if anyone would like
to do that...

791
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.364
Wait a minute.

792
00:28:34.408 --> 00:28:36.018
Gus. I don't see
your name down here.

793
00:28:36.062 --> 00:28:37.759
so I'm going to...

794
00:28:37.803 --> 00:28:40.283
Right. the arm.

795
00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:43.417
I would like to point out that
Dottie has graciously agreed

796
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.027
to do our banners this year.

797
00:28:45.071 --> 00:28:46.550
So round of applause
for Dottie please.

798
00:28:46.594 --> 00:28:47.421
[applause]

799
00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:49.031
Thank you very much.

800
00:28:49.075 --> 00:28:51.120
Dottie: My pleasure.

801
00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:54.167
And also new this year is
the face painting station

802
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.516
for the kids.

803
00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:58.258
So if anyone knows anyone
who's good with kids

804
00:28:58.301 --> 00:28:59.868
who has any artistic...

805
00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:01.391
I'd love to.

806
00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:04.307
Hey. wow.
Thank you. Lauren.

807
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:08.398
You are hereby anointed
resident facial artist.

808
00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:09.835
Nice.

809
00:29:09.878 --> 00:29:11.097
All right. so.

810
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.316
We still have ice cream.
again my favourite.

811
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.970
And flowers as well.

812
00:29:15.014 --> 00:29:16.102
Go.

813
00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:17.494
I'll catch up with you
at my parents.

814
00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:18.626
Ok.

815
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:19.540
Martin: Oh. beautiful.

816
00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:21.411
All right. thank you very much.

817
00:29:21.455 --> 00:29:22.412
That is a good choice.

818
00:29:22.456 --> 00:29:23.849
Thank you again. Susan.

819
00:29:23.892 --> 00:29:24.719
All right we'll...

820
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:25.633
Hello again.

821
00:29:25.676 --> 00:29:27.243
[sighs]

822
00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:30.464
You know I moved to get away
from people like you?

823
00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:31.944
Well. you don't even know me.

824
00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:35.730
I know that you won't take no
for an answer.

825
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:36.992
Okay. Okay.

826
00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:38.167
I won't ask you again.

827
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:39.647
Okay.

828
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.127
I just really want you to think
about the opportunity

829
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.389
that you have to let the world
know who you really are.

830
00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:43.738
Anything that you want
people to know.

831
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.131
Anything at all.

832
00:29:45.174 --> 00:29:46.654
It's free publicity.

833
00:29:46.697 --> 00:29:49.744
You could tease your next novel.

834
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.572
Look. I don't need
the publicity.

835
00:29:51.615 --> 00:29:55.794
My last five books sold two
million copies. so why you?

836
00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:01.364
Because I care.

837
00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:06.805
You're not... an interview
conquest on a checklist for me.

838
00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:08.458
You're an artist.

839
00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:11.200
And I can relate. I... I know
what it's like to craft a story

840
00:30:11.244 --> 00:30:13.637
and fall in love
with your characters.

841
00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:17.467
You have to when you want to
tell a story that moves people.

842
00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:18.599
And that's all I want to do.

843
00:30:18.642 --> 00:30:19.643
I want to move people.

844
00:30:19.687 --> 00:30:21.167
That's all I've ever wanted
to do.

845
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.997
and I'm really good at it.

846
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.176
And I think you should
give me a chance.

847
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.182
Why "Shadows of Doubt"?

848
00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:40.403
Yesterday. when you listed
my books that inspired you.

849
00:30:40.447 --> 00:30:41.883
you didn't say "Shadows of Doubt."

850
00:30:41.927 --> 00:30:45.321
I'm just curious why.

851
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:46.888
Do you really want to know?

852
00:30:46.932 --> 00:30:50.631
Yeah. kind of.

853
00:30:50.674 --> 00:30:52.633
I thought your main character
was predictable.

854
00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:54.026
[scoffs]

855
00:30:54.069 --> 00:30:55.418
He's the grizzled detective
who destroys everything

856
00:30:55.462 --> 00:30:57.681
that he cares about in favour
of his career.

857
00:30:57.725 --> 00:31:00.293
and it's glorified.

858
00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:02.338
He's made out to be a hero
for doing it.

859
00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:05.907
but the truth is he destroyed
everything that he loves

860
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:08.692
because he didn't want
to get hurt first.

861
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:12.131
I felt like he was playing
it safe. and...

862
00:31:12.174 --> 00:31:13.045
And it's a cop out.

863
00:31:13.088 --> 00:31:15.438
Yes. but aren't we all?

864
00:31:15.482 --> 00:31:17.005
Maybe.

865
00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:19.051
But for me. that's what
I've always loved

866
00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:21.096
about your characters.

867
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.579
They take chances. they
make themselves vulnerable.

868
00:31:25.622 --> 00:31:28.190
Which is what I'm asking of you.

869
00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:35.284
Sorry. I didn't mean to offend
you. I'm just...

870
00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:36.851
Being honest.

871
00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:43.292
I have some ground rules.

872
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:49.342
We keep this limited to
my writing career only.

873
00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:52.911
I'll give you three interviews.
half an hour each.

874
00:31:55.087 --> 00:31:57.785
No deal.

875
00:31:57.828 --> 00:31:59.569
I have to be able to ask you
whatever I want.

876
00:31:59.613 --> 00:32:01.484
and I want to shadow you
for an all-access.

877
00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:03.660
unvarnished account of how
you live and work.

878
00:32:03.704 --> 00:32:06.707
It's the only way to do it
right. and you know it.

879
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.230
Fine.

880
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.276
But with one caveat.

881
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.713
I get to read the story
before it goes to print.

882
00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:17.283
That's my insurance that
I'm not being misrepresented.

883
00:32:17.326 --> 00:32:18.762
Fine.

884
00:32:18.806 --> 00:32:22.157
But I expect nothing but
complete and total honesty.

885
00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:23.680
Fine.

886
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:27.858
And you get to help me with
Founder's Day Celebration.

887
00:32:27.902 --> 00:32:28.511
Get to?

888
00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:30.949
Oh yeah.

889
00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:33.516
It's a big job. so I need
some help.

890
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.083
[clears throat]

891
00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:38.478
Deal.

892
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.699
Deal.

893
00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:46.181
We start tomorrow.
bright and early.

894
00:32:49.184 --> 00:32:51.447
Why did you just say yes?

895
00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:57.758
Maybe there is something
that I want the world to know.

896
00:32:57.801 --> 00:32:59.629
Good.

897
00:32:59.673 --> 00:33:01.022
The interview hasn't started
yet. so.

898
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:03.894
When you say "bright
and early." you'll call me.

899
00:33:03.938 --> 00:33:05.113
Yep.

900
00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:08.856
[sighs]

901
00:33:11.902 --> 00:33:12.903

904

his mind?

to trust me.

I gave him some constructive
criticism on one of his books.

909
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:27.831

as less of a fan

capable of telling the truth.

with a hammer.

What about your childhood?

I know you were born
in the Midwest.

965
00:35:52.715 --> 00:35:53.803

your teenage years?

Yeah. you're right.
That was just a line.

988
00:36:29.448 --> 00:36:33.626
Uh... I was always shy
as a kid.

989
00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:35.628
It was hard for me
to make friends.

990
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:38.457
especially with us moving
all the time.

991
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.808
When I was 10. I created
this imaginary character

992
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:44.289
named Danny Boyd.

993
00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:45.899
I have no idea where
the name came from.

994
00:36:45.942 --> 00:36:48.815
it just sort of wrote itself.

995
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:54.603
I wrote all this back story and
wrote down every last detail.

996
00:36:54.647 --> 00:36:56.649
Yeah. I guess that's
where it all started.

997
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.999
Been creating characters
ever since.

998
00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:00.696
Why mystery?

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.047

1001

characters solving problems.

Vanessa: Oh!

1082
00:40:10.582 --> 00:40:13.193
These are gorgeous. Dottie.

1083
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:14.542
Thank you so much
for doing these.

1084
00:40:14.586 --> 00:40:16.022
Oh. don't mention it.

1085
00:40:16.065 --> 00:40:19.025
Any excuse to get
the paintbrushes out.

1086
00:40:19.068 --> 00:40:20.853
These are amazing.

1087
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.681
Oh. thank you.

1088
00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:24.117
Did you take them yourself?

1089
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.162
Yeah. and thousands more.

1090
00:40:26.206 --> 00:40:27.860
Wow.

1091
00:40:28.513 --> 00:40:30.079
And you do portraits also?

1092
00:40:30.123 --> 00:40:32.342
Yeah. when I get a chance.

1093
00:40:32.386 --> 00:40:33.909
They're really exceptional.

1094
00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:35.520
Now you're going to make
me blush.

1095
00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:37.043
[chuckles]

1096
00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:46.226
Hey guys. I almost forgot.

1097
00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:48.533
A little something
for you later.

1098
00:40:48.576 --> 00:40:51.710
in case you get hungry while
you're out running errands.

1099
00:40:51.753 --> 00:40:53.668
Oh. thank you!

1100
00:40:53.712 --> 00:40:55.235
You're welcome.

1101
00:40:55.278 --> 00:40:56.628
That's sweet.

1102
00:40:56.671 --> 00:40:59.108
So. you coming to
the Founder's Day Celebration

1103
00:40:59.152 --> 00:41:00.501
next Saturday?

1104
00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:03.809
Um. no. I'm going to be back
in Portland. so.

1105
00:41:03.852 --> 00:41:06.507
Oh. that's a shame.

1106
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:09.031
I know. I keep telling her
she's missing out.

1107
00:41:09.075 --> 00:41:10.380
[laughs]

1108
00:41:11.643 --> 00:41:13.296
Well. thank you again
for these. Dottie.

1109
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:13.862
They're beautiful.

1110
00:41:13.906 --> 00:41:15.081
[laughs]

1111
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:16.865
You two have a great day.
'Kay.

1112
00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:17.736
Thanks. Dottie.

1113
00:41:17.779 --> 00:41:19.389
- Bye.
- Bye.

1114
00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:25.047
Okay. so Founder's Day.

1115
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:26.658
I want details.

1116
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:33.926
Well. the legend goes
that in the spring of 1857.

1117
00:41:33.969 --> 00:41:36.450
a rancher named Festus Thompson

1118
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:39.540
won the town in a poker game
with a wealthy landowner.

1119
00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:40.802
'Kay.

1120
00:41:40.846 --> 00:41:43.065
Apparently there was only
$3 in the pot too.

1121
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:44.240
That's quite a deal.

1122
00:41:44.284 --> 00:41:45.590
Yeah. I'll say.

1123
00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:49.898
So. Thompson fell in love
with the place

1124
00:41:49.942 --> 00:41:53.772
and when he settled it.
he named it after himself.

1125
00:41:53.815 --> 00:41:54.990
Thompson Lake.

1126
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:57.123
So it's both a celebration
of spring

1127
00:41:57.166 --> 00:41:59.081
and the birth of our town.

1128
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:01.257
It's a really fun time.
actually.

1129
00:42:01.301 --> 00:42:03.346
Kind of sad you're not going
to be here.

1130
00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:07.046
Yeah. me too.

1131
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:09.352
It's really important to you.
huh?

1132
00:42:09.396 --> 00:42:11.398
Yeah. yeah it is.

1133
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:12.965
I don't know.

1134
00:42:13.008 --> 00:42:15.358
I just think it's important
for people to come together

1135
00:42:15.402 --> 00:42:18.797
and get to know their neighbour.

1136
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.059
It's a sense of community

1137
00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:22.714
I never really had
in the big city.

1138
00:42:22.757 --> 00:42:23.671
Hmm.

1139
00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:26.413
You ever miss it. the city?

1140
00:42:26.456 --> 00:42:29.285
What. the noise and traffic.

1141
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:31.070
and everyone bumping
into each other?

1142
00:42:31.113 --> 00:42:32.419
No. no. Not really.

1143
00:42:32.462 --> 00:42:33.855
Not even a little bit?

1144
00:42:36.162 --> 00:42:37.119
No.

1145
00:42:37.163 --> 00:42:39.818
No. this is my home now.

1146
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:41.863
So why here?
Why Thompson Lake?

1147
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:47.086
Sometimes you just know.

1148
00:42:47.129 --> 00:42:48.870
You know?

1149
00:42:48.914 --> 00:42:52.308
Yeah. Yeah.

1150
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:53.396
It's kind of like...

1151
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.225
kind of like a relationship.
really.

1152
00:42:56.269 --> 00:42:59.446
Yeah. Yeah.
It is.

1153
00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:03.232
Speaking of which. um. is there
anybody special in your life?

1154
00:43:03.276 --> 00:43:04.973
Oh. impressive segue.

1155
00:43:05.017 --> 00:43:06.845
[laughing]
Thank you. I'm
a professional.

1156
00:43:06.888 --> 00:43:07.933
[laughs]

1157
00:43:07.976 --> 00:43:10.152
Uh. no. No. I can't say
that there is.

1158
00:43:10.196 --> 00:43:11.719
Oh. okay.

1159
00:43:11.763 --> 00:43:16.245
You never wanted to get married
or have a family?

1160
00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:18.421
This is... this is the life
I chose.

1161
00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:22.687
and that's all there really is
to say about that.

1162
00:43:27.735 --> 00:43:31.086
It's just. he reveals some.
and then he shuts down.

1163
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.305
and then he opens up.

1164
00:43:32.348 --> 00:43:33.262
and it's like bits and pieces.
you know?

1165
00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:34.786
It'll take time though.

1166
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:37.223
I mean. imagine divulging
your entire life to a stranger

1167
00:43:37.266 --> 00:43:39.225
knowing millions of people
are going to read it.

1168
00:43:39.268 --> 00:43:40.400
Yeah.

1169
00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:42.315
I just don't have much time.

1170
00:43:42.358 --> 00:43:44.534
So is he what you thought?

1171
00:43:44.578 --> 00:43:47.842
Um. he's got a very gentle
and caring side.

1172
00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:49.757
Oh. okay. okay.

1173
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:52.281
And. um. you know he's not quite
the curmudgeon

1174
00:43:52.325 --> 00:43:53.500
everybody thought he was.

1175
00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:54.370
He's actually pretty easy
to be around.

1176
00:43:54.414 --> 00:43:55.676
so that's nice.

1177
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.373
He's cute.

1178
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.113
Yes.

1179
00:43:58.157 --> 00:44:00.550
Is he single?

1180
00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:01.595
Yes.

1181
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:02.814
Why?

1182
00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:04.380
Because you guys would make
a cute couple.

1183
00:44:04.424 --> 00:44:06.034
Okay. You know what?

1184
00:44:06.078 --> 00:44:07.383
I'm trying to focus
on my work right now.

1185
00:44:07.427 --> 00:44:09.603
so I just want to keep
this professional.

1186
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.170
Anyway I'm going to go to bed.

1187
00:44:11.213 --> 00:44:12.650
because who knows what he has
in store for me tomorrow?

1188
00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:14.521
But you can't tell me
you haven't been lost

1189
00:44:14.564 --> 00:44:16.436
in those amazing blue eyes.

1190
00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:17.567
Brown.

1191
00:44:17.611 --> 00:44:18.351
Oh my...

1192
00:44:18.394 --> 00:44:19.526
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1193
00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:29.754
I have to say. this version
of you is very different

1194
00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:32.060
from the cosmopolitan
Martin Clayborne

1195
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:34.759
that burst onto the literary
scene years ago.

1196
00:44:34.802 --> 00:44:38.371
Well. I'm afraid
that guy's long gone.

1197
00:44:38.414 --> 00:44:40.808
Yeah. You were. um. you were
telling me yesterday

1198
00:44:40.852 --> 00:44:42.941
about how you ended up here
in Thompson Lake.

1199
00:44:42.984 --> 00:44:44.682
Care to elaborate?

1200
00:44:44.725 --> 00:44:47.206
There's not much
to elaborate on.

1201
00:44:47.249 --> 00:44:50.209
Well. there are a million
quiet places with nice people.

1202
00:44:50.252 --> 00:44:53.255
Why settle down here?

1203
00:44:53.299 --> 00:44:55.693
I don't know.

1204
00:44:55.736 --> 00:44:58.391
Some things can't be described.

1205
00:44:58.434 --> 00:45:01.786
Now that is an interesting
statement from a writer.

1206
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:04.005
Well. I don't know.
You're a writer.

1207
00:45:04.049 --> 00:45:06.747
How would you describe
what home means to you?

1208
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:08.706
Um...

1209
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:13.798
Fair enough.

1210
00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:15.756
Yeah. it can be really hard
to put into words

1211
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.976
the things that we love.

1212
00:45:22.023 --> 00:45:27.594
Speaking of love. you uh. have
anyone special back at home?

1213
00:45:27.637 --> 00:45:29.552
Impressive segue.
It's good.

1214
00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:30.292
Learned from the best.

1215
00:45:30.336 --> 00:45:31.163
[laughs]

1216
00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:32.077
The answer is no.

1217
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.905
Just no?

1218
00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:35.080
You care to elaborate?

1219
00:45:35.123 --> 00:45:36.124
Uh. not really.

1220
00:45:36.168 --> 00:45:37.909
There's not much
to elaborate on.

1221
00:45:37.952 --> 00:45:39.432
Okay.

1222
00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:42.478
[laughs]

1223
00:45:42.522 --> 00:45:43.828
You think he's trying
to tell us something?

1224
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:45.655
I mean. how can you deny
that face?

1225
00:45:45.699 --> 00:45:46.874
I can't.

1226
00:45:46.918 --> 00:45:48.702
Aww!

1227
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:49.485
Come here.

1228
00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:50.269
Oh.

1229
00:45:50.312 --> 00:45:51.357
Want me to get the ball?

1230
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.054
Okay. sit. I will throw
the ball.

1231
00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:54.621
but you have to answer some
questions first.

1232
00:45:54.664 --> 00:45:55.448
Are you ready?

1233
00:45:55.491 --> 00:45:56.101
Uh-oh.

1234
00:45:56.144 --> 00:45:57.015
Okay.

1235
00:45:57.058 --> 00:45:59.974
What is Martin's greatest fear?

1236
00:46:02.672 --> 00:46:04.196
It's probably too hard.
It's probably too hard.

1237
00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:06.851
Okay. What is Martin's
favourite colour?

1238
00:46:11.203 --> 00:46:13.074
Oh. you really are loyal.

1239
00:46:13.118 --> 00:46:14.293
Go get it!

1240
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.904
[laughs]

1241
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:19.689
Oh well.

1242
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.431
Blue.

1243
00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:28.002
And uh. I'm afraid that
if I stopped writing.

1244
00:46:28.046 --> 00:46:29.917
no one would care.

1245
00:46:32.964 --> 00:46:33.878
Here we go.

1246
00:46:33.921 --> 00:46:35.357

1249
00:46:53.636 --> 00:46:54.768
I think he likes you.

Fine.

00:59:57.506 --> 00:59:59.378
[gasps]
Wow!

1616
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:06.559
Exactly what I said
the first time I saw it.

1617
01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.430
Figured if I can't be
inspired here.

1618
01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:09.997
I'm beyond hope.

1619
01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:11.608
[sighs]

1620
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.309
So uh. I know you did
your research on me.

1621
01:00:17.352 --> 01:00:20.268
Yes. well what little
there is to do.

1622
01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:22.575
So you know my story.

1623
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.360
I know that you became
a celebrity author

1624
01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:28.755
and you kind of got caught up
in the literary high life.

1625
01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.322
Right. right.

1626
01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:35.544
Well. there's fiction
and then there's reality.

1627
01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:36.981
The truth is...

1628
01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:41.159
I was engaged.

1629
01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:44.336
I was in a happy.
committed relationship.

1630
01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:47.556
All I really wanted to do
was just get married.

1631
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.906
settle down.

1632
01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.342
What happened?

1633
01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:54.215
Well. we met in New York
just after college

1634
01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:57.741
and I kept putting off marriage
until I had some success.

1635
01:00:57.784 --> 01:01:00.265
Still unpublished then.

1636
01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:02.920
And then once I did have
success with my first book.

1637
01:01:02.963 --> 01:01:05.139
it just... I don't know.

1638
01:01:05.183 --> 01:01:06.619
Everything changed.

1639
01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.056
I suddenly had all these people
telling me where to go.

1640
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.538
what parties to attend.
how to play the game.

1641
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:15.933
According to my agent. it
was all to create a persona.

1642
01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:18.805
This celebrity writer.

1643
01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:21.286
They thought it would help
sell more books.

1644
01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:26.160
And it worked.
just a little too well.

1645
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:27.684
What happened to your fiancé?

1646
01:01:27.727 --> 01:01:29.816
Oh. she wanted nothing
to do with the spotlight.

1647
01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.339
Nope.

1648
01:01:31.383 --> 01:01:37.258
Wasn't what she signed up
for. so. um. so we broke up.

1649
01:01:37.302 --> 01:01:38.433
I'm sorry.

1650
01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:41.393
Must've been painful.

1651
01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:45.005
Yeah. It was.

1652
01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:48.792
And then you left New York when?

1653
01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:51.098
Not long thereafter.

1654
01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:55.015
I agreed to let a journalist
like yourself tag along.

1655
01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:56.974
do a profile.

1656
01:01:57.017 --> 01:02:00.760
And when the article came out.
it was like...

1657
01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:04.329
I didn't even recognize myself.

1658
01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:08.246
It was like this character
that I helped write

1659
01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:11.640
and I just hated it. you know?

1660
01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:15.340
After that I wanted nothing to
do with celebrity life either.

1661
01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:21.781
So... I packed up my stuff.
headed west. no destination.

1662
01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.609
Just drove.

1663
01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:25.872
I stopped at little towns
along the way.

1664
01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:29.658
but when I stopped here
it felt like home.

1665
01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:30.703
Mm.

1666
01:02:32.705 --> 01:02:34.794
Um...

1667
01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:38.189
Made it here. nobody cares
about who you were.

1668
01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:41.018
Just care about who you are.

1669
01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:42.846
Seems like it's worked out
really well for you.

1670
01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:44.891
You've... you've had
an amazing career.

1671
01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:48.590
Oh. success beyond
my wildest dreams.

1672
01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:52.899
Only now the story is that
I'm another bitter writer

1673
01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:57.164
who couldn't handle the real
world. so he hid himself away.

1674
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.166
Is there any truth to that?

1675
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:05.999
As far as I'm concerned.
this is the real world.

1676
01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:07.827
Yeah.

1677
01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:10.525
I agree with you.

1678
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:15.226
So you're telling me this whole
time you've been here.

1679
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:18.272
there's been no one special?

1680
01:03:18.316 --> 01:03:20.971
I don't know.

1681
01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:23.538
Wouldn't say that.

1682
01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:28.195
Uh. would you care to elaborate?

1683
01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:29.457
Not yet.

1684
01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:32.156
Okay.

1685
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:37.857
Uh. well you got
your notes. so...

1686
01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:38.771
Yeah.

1687
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:39.728
Maybe we should...

1688
01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:41.165
Okay. sure.

1689
01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:52.959
Well. this is nice.

1690
01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:54.091
Thank you.

1691
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:56.223
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

1692
01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:58.008
- Okay.
- Okay.

1693
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:00.314
Um... Hey. before you go.

1694
01:04:00.358 --> 01:04:04.188
Do you want to come inside
for a cold drink?

1695
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.276
Yeah. sure.

1696
01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:05.929
All right.

1697
01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:06.886
Okay.

1698
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:07.713
Lauren: Hey. Martin!

1699
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:08.757
Oh.

1700
01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:09.846
Oh!

1701
01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:13.240
Thought I had the wrong time.

1702
01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:14.241
No. no.

1703
01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:15.547
You have the right time.

1704
01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:18.202
I just lost track of time.
sorry about that.

1705
01:04:18.245 --> 01:04:20.378
Um. can we do a rain check
on that?

1706
01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:22.032
Yeah. of course. of course.
No problem.

1707
01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:22.771
I'm Vanessa.

1708
01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:23.903
Oh hi. I'm Lauren.

1709
01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:25.296
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1710
01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:26.427
Sorry. yes.

1711
01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:29.213
Vanessa is in town
doing an article.

1712
01:04:29.256 --> 01:04:30.257
Great.

1713
01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:34.783
And Lauren is a teacher
who is helping me

1714
01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.220
with the Founder's Day
Celebration.

1715
01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:37.961
Great. Okay.

1716
01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.179
Well I'll leave you to it.

1717
01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:39.919
Have fun.

1718
01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:41.399
- Okay.
- Okay.

1719
01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:42.226
Uh. see you tomorrow.

1720
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:43.836
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

1721
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.663
Bye.

1722
01:04:44.706 --> 01:04:45.620
Sorry about the...

1723
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.362
[sighs]

1724
01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:49.494
Hi.

1725
01:04:51.713 --> 01:04:53.715
Now I'm really confused.

1726
01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:55.021
Explain.

1727
01:04:55.065 --> 01:04:58.851
Um. we... I'm not sure
how to put it exactly.

1728
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.985
Try words.

1729
01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:05.031
We had a moment.

1730
01:05:05.075 --> 01:05:06.119
Okay.

1731
01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:07.251
And?

1732
01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:09.383
And I wanted to keep it
professional.

1733
01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.994
so we went back to the house.

1734
01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:13.344
And then guess who was waiting
for him on his front porch?

1735
01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:14.519
The girl from the library?

1736
01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:15.824
Lauren.

1737
01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:17.000
And he gets all weird.
and he's. like. awkward.

1738
01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:18.958
and just like didn't
know what to do or say.

1739
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:20.525
and it was so strange.

1740
01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:21.961
He's hiding something from me
and I don't know what it is.

1741
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.441
You'll just have
to keep digging.

1742
01:05:23.484 --> 01:05:24.921
I don't have much time.

Oh.

- Hi.
- Hi.

1749
01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:11.184
I didn't catch you in the middle
of something. did I?

1750
01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:12.359
Um. no.

1751
01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:15.536
No. I'm just getting ready
to turn in.

1752
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.973
What's going on?

1753
01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:21.194
Well. I was hoping that we could
talk about tomorrow.

1754
01:06:21.238 --> 01:06:22.717
Yeah.

1755
01:06:22.761 --> 01:06:24.719
What kind of manual labour
do you have planned for me?

1756
01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:29.028
Well. I was actually hoping
that we could switch it up.

1757
01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.769
Okay. like what?

grab a bite.
stroll through town?

1760
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.212
Or not.

1761
01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:40.474
We don't...

1762
01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.432
No. no. That sounds great.
That's great.

1763
01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:42.172
Great.

1764
01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:43.042
All right.

1765
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.043
Well. it is a date.

1766
01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:45.653
It is a plan.

1767
01:06:45.697 --> 01:06:47.786
It's a plan. yeah.

1768
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:48.656
A plan for tomorrow.

1769
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.744
Okay. great.

1770
01:06:49.788 --> 01:06:50.615
Time?

1771
01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:52.312
Let's say 6:00.

1772
01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.183
Great. That's great.

1773
01:06:53.226 --> 01:06:55.272
Okay. See you then.

1774
01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:57.230
Take good care.

1775
01:06:57.274 --> 01:06:58.536
You too.

1776
01:07:01.626 --> 01:07:03.976
Thanks for getting our dinner.
That was nice.

1777
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.849
Aw. let's call it
small-town hospitality.

1778
01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.373
That's how we roll up here.

1779
01:07:09.416 --> 01:07:10.765
Oh!

1780
01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:17.511
So tell me something
embarrassing.

1781
01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:20.601
Something that most people
don't know about you.

1782
01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:22.429
I think you're missing
the concept

1783
01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:25.476
of interviewer. interviewee
relationship.

1784
01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:27.391
Maybe. but I was thinking
that maybe tonight

1785
01:07:27.434 --> 01:07:30.350
we could forget about that.

1786
01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:34.659
Just for tonight. just be
two people talking.

1787
01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:38.402
Embarrassing. huh?

1788
01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:40.012
Yeah.

1789
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.754
Um. I can't dance.

1790
01:07:42.797 --> 01:07:44.016
[laughs]

1791
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:44.669
Really?

1792
01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:45.191
Yeah.

1793
01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:45.844
Not at all?

1794
01:07:45.887 --> 01:07:46.410
No. not at all.

1795
01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:47.759
Like. I'll try.

1796
01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:49.369
Uh-huh.

1797
01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:52.546
So I remember we had to learn
the one-two-three. one-two...

1798
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.331
Like. my brain tells my feet.
and I can't.

1799
01:07:54.374 --> 01:07:55.245
I can't do it.

1800
01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:56.550
That's alright.

1801
01:07:56.594 --> 01:08:00.163
What about you? Got some
embarrassing stories?

1802
01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:01.120
When I was a kid...

1803
01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:02.469
Thank you.

1804
01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:07.431
I used to think that
if you ate an apple seed

1805
01:08:07.474 --> 01:08:10.564
an apple tree would actually
grow inside your stomach.

1806
01:08:10.608 --> 01:08:12.131
I think all kids think that.

1807
01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:13.089
Really?

1808
01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:13.741
Yeah.

1809
01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:14.438
They do?

1810
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:15.265
Stop it.

1811
01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:17.049
No. really. I didn't know.

1812
01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.791
Now I feel a lot better
actually. thank you.

1813
01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:21.619
[laughs]

1814
01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:23.447
Okay. this is good.
This is good.

1815
01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:24.970
Um. well...

1816
01:08:25.013 --> 01:08:25.927
I will tell you. I'm going
to trust you with this now.

1817
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:27.712
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm?

1818
01:08:27.755 --> 01:08:30.062
I also had an invisible friend.

1819
01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.196
[posh accent] Her name was
Victoria Farnsworth Longfellow.

1820
01:08:33.239 --> 01:08:34.849
Oh. wow. Very royal.

1821
01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:36.634
Yes. and she was a queen.

1822
01:08:36.677 --> 01:08:38.418
She liked to order
everybody around.

1823
01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:40.159
And I miss her terribly.

1824
01:08:45.382 --> 01:08:46.861
Hmm.

1825
01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:57.133
You know. I have been meaning
to tell you something.

1826
01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:59.135
Remember when I agreed
to do the interview.

1827
01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:04.749
I said that there was something
that I needed to tell the world?

1828
01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:05.793
Yeah?

1829
01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:09.667
I'm quitting.

1830
01:09:13.758 --> 01:09:14.933
Are you serious?

1831
01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:16.587
I am.

1832
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.110
What?

1833
01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:22.854
I am. My career as a mystery
writer has come to an end.

1834
01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:23.942
Why?

1835
01:09:23.985 --> 01:09:25.161
The last couple years.

1836
01:09:25.204 --> 01:09:26.771
I just. I felt like all
I've been doing is

1837
01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:30.557
repackaging the same stories
in new jacket covers.

1838
01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:32.603
Wow.

1839
01:09:32.646 --> 01:09:36.346
That definitely puts a new spin
on the article. but...

1840
01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:39.349
I thought you'd be happy.

1841
01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:40.306
I'm happy for the article.

1842
01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.221
I mean. that's a good. um...

1843
01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.397
I mean. you have the scoop
or whatever.

1844
01:09:44.441 --> 01:09:46.094
Scoop. yeah.

1845
01:09:46.138 --> 01:09:48.575
I just can't imagine a world
in which I am not

1846
01:09:48.619 --> 01:09:53.145
looking forward to reading the
next Martin Clayborne novel.

1847
01:09:55.539 --> 01:09:57.410
Thank you for that.

1848
01:09:57.454 --> 01:09:59.804
That's very sweet of you to say.

1849
01:09:59.847 --> 01:10:03.242
But I wasn't even planning
on making an announcement.

1850
01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:07.420
I thought it was just best if I.
you know. kind of faded away.

1851
01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:09.466
Then I met you.
and you convinced me

1852
01:10:09.509 --> 01:10:13.600
that my fans deserve the truth.

1853
01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:15.036
They do.

1854
01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:18.518
And I thought that this was
going to be a perfect platform.

1855
01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:19.563
you know?

1856
01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:21.434
This is the perfect way
to go out.

1857
01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:24.045
You're giving up a life
so many people want.

1858
01:10:24.089 --> 01:10:28.049
I would kill for your career.

1859
01:10:28.093 --> 01:10:30.574
Then finish your novel.

1860
01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:31.879
That is not the same.

1861
01:10:31.923 --> 01:10:33.490
It's not that simple for me.

1862
01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:35.274
I know you didn't ask
for my two cents.

1863
01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:37.581
but I'm going to give it
to you anyway.

1864
01:10:37.624 --> 01:10:41.280
The last thing you want to do
is wake up and realize

1865
01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:44.762
you didn't do what
you are destined to.

1866
01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:50.463

Yeah. He's hanging it up.

1872

1873

That's quite a scoop

writing things I actually
care about.

1884
01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:11.370

I'm not.

1890
01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.297
Amber. trying to be a successful
novelist is a really hard life.

1891
01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.517
I don't know if I'm cut out
for this.

1892
01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:33.087
What?

1893
01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:34.001
Nothing.

1894

Oh. nothing nothing.
What?

1895
01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:39.093
I just. I'm thinking about you
and your motto.

1896
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:42.096
which is "go boldly in
the direction of your dreams

1897
01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.751
and live the life
you've imagined."

1898
01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:47.406
You know. it's not "go boldly in
the direction of your dreams

1899
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:50.453
and then give up when
it gets really. really hard."

1900
01:12:50.496 --> 01:12:52.411
I hear you.

1901
01:12:52.455 --> 01:12:54.413
I know what I'm doing.

1902
01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:57.938
Are you ready?

1903
01:12:57.982 --> 01:12:59.375
Yeah. almost.

Just about to go down

1910
01:13:11.212 --> 01:13:14.041

We're going to head back.

You're leaving now?

1919
01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:26.271
Yeah.

1920
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:29.796
Oh.

1921
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.800
I can't thank you enough
for taking me on this adventure

I can't let you go.

1926
01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:49.686
There's something I need
to show you.

1927
01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:51.209
Oh.

1928
01:13:52.079 --> 01:13:53.603

01:14:23.763 --> 01:14:25.417

Well. there will be no more

This is the end of one chapter
and the beginning of the next.

1942
01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:36.210
And I didn't want this work
to get an unfair advantage

1943
01:14:36.254 --> 01:14:39.170
or disadvantage
because of my name.

1944
01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:42.042
Why children's books?

1945

Writing these makes me happy.

1946
01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:47.787
and it's taken me a long time
to realize

1947
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:51.051
that if it doesn't
make you happy.

1948
01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:52.662
