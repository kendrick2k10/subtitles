00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.995
Did your client ever make
a call on the basketball court

4
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.831
that was influenced
by his association with gamblers?

5
00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:32.592
He denies that it ever took place?

6
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.599
What are we doing here?

7
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.105
Why is everybody's story
about the Marriott so different?

8
00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:45.150
Had he not made that threat...

9
00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:47.694
...would you have bet with him?

10
00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.193
We've got a ref
in our hip pocket.

11
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.070
What's his name?

12
00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:20.211
What's his name?

13
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:22.672
Tim Donaghy.

14
01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:17.066
- Were you inside?
- No. You?

15
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.609
Yeah. he got 15 months.

16
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:21.279
Fifteen months is
what I hear. Three years probation.

17
01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:28.841
Stern offered you a job
in the course of the investigation.

18
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:29.842
Is that true?

19
01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.990
I think that your concern
that you would appear well-off

20
01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.701
is only problematic if you made

21
01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:50.663
more money than you say you did.

22
01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.289
-Right?
-Right. Sure.

23
01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:56.502
Did you make more money
than you said you did?

24
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:40.439
I had asked you if you made
more money than you told people.

25
01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:43.484
and you said you didn't know.
Is that honest?

26
01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.742
Okay. Did you make
more money than you said you did?
