The impact on Broadway

157
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.189
has been devastating --

158
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.170
thousands of theater jobs lost.

159
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.019
and each week

160
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.019
Broadway is closed.

161
00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.220
it loses tens of millions

162
00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.220
in ticket sales.

163
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.009

164
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.009
be back and better than ever.

165
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.129
But until that time.

166
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.129
theater professionals

167
00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.050
are turning to Broadway Cares

168
00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.050
to stay afloat.

169
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.060

171

172

173
00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.189
Thank you. Tina. And by the way.

174
00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.189
I loved you in "The Crown."

175
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.180
As you may or may not know.

176
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.180
I made my Broadway debut in 1982

177
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.149
at the Circle

178
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.149
in the Square Theatre

179
00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.100
in a revival of Noel Coward's

180
00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.100
"Present Laughter"

181
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.079
starring and directed by the

182
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.079
late. great George C. Scott.

183
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.250
I've appeared in

184
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.250
23 Broadway shows since then

185
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.149
and at least as many

186
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.149
off-Broadway.

187
00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.019
so my connection

188
00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.019
to the New York theater

189
00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:59.079
and its people runs deep.

190
00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.259
One of the many reasons

191
00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.259
I love theater people

192
00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.189
is because you can always

193
00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.189
count on them to be there.

958
00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:06.160
From then on. every Saturday.

959
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.089
I took the subway

960
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.089
from Brooklyn to Manhattan

961
00:31:09.089 --> 00:31:10.250
to see another show.

962
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.160
After I moved to Manhattan

963
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.160
when I was 16.

964
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.150
I was so happy to get a job

965
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.150
on New Year's Eve

966
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.059
as an usher

967
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.059
in a Broadway theater.

968
00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:23.259
where I was paid -- I remember

969
00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:23.259
that. too --

970
00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:26.259
$4.15 an hour

971
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:29.210
and got to see the show

972
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:29.210
for free.

973
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.049
Little did they know

974
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.049
I would have paid them.

975
00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:34.289
When I was 19.

976
00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:39.019
I was lucky to be cast

977
00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:39.019
in my first Broadway role.

978
00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:43.049
as the lovelorn secretary

979
00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:43.049
Miss Marmelstein

980
00:31:43.049 --> 00:31:45.289
in "I Can Get It

981
00:31:43.049 --> 00:31:45.289
For You Wholesale."

982
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:48.240
Two years later.

983
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:48.240
I found myself playing

984
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.019
the lead role of Fanny Brice

985
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.019
in "Funny Girl."

986
00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:54.059
What I think about it.

987
00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:54.059
I can still feel

988
00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:57.059
the excitement

989
00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:57.059
of the creative process.

990
00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:00.099
working on the script.

991
00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:00.099
or rehearsing the songs.

992
00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:04.289
And it makes me think

993
00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:04.289
of all the young people today

994
00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:07.210
who dream of being on the stage

995
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:12.069
but have no outlet for their

996
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:12.069
talent and creative energy.

997
00:32:12.069 --> 00:32:17.150
I'm worried about the thousands

998
00:32:12.069 --> 00:32:17.150
of dedicated professionals

999
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:22.099
who have lost their jobs --

1000
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:22.099
actors. writers. directors.

1001
00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:24.210
choreographers. costume people.

1002
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.079
set designers.

1003
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.079
sound and lighting technicians.

1004
00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:32.140
makeup artists.

1005
00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:32.140
musicians. stagehands.

1006
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.029
And what about the audience --

1007
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.029
all of the people

1008
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:39.079
who simply want a break

1009
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:39.079
from their daily lives.

1010
00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:42.000
who go to a show

1011
00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:42.000
to be transported

1012
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.210
into another reality

1013
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.210
for a few hours?

1014
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:50.240
Because there is nothing more

1015
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:50.240
exhilarating than live theater.

1016
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.170

1017
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.170

1262

is a really unique one.

1263
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.230
One of the wonderful things

1264
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.230
about Motown was the start

1265
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.030
of the intersection

1266
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.030

1267
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.019

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.019

1269
00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:23.099
not knowing what the other end

1270
00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:23.099
of it looks like.

1271
00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:24.289
but knowing they got

1272
00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:24.289

1273
00:42:24.289 --> 00:42:26.050
There's speaking the message.

1274
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.250
and then there's just

1275
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.250
being the message.

1276
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.219
And this show is the message.

1277
00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:32.260
