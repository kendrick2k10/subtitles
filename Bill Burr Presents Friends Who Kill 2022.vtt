[announcer] <i>Please welcome Bill Burr.</i>

5
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.843
All right. what's going on?

6
00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:52.844
How are you?

7
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.096
Good evening.

8
00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.932
Good evening and welcome.

9
00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:04.522
Welcome to this wonderful evening
of stand-up comedy.

10
00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.984
All right. you guys have great energy.

11
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.110
I like that.

12
00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.196
I'm liking the energy already.

13
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.284
It's safe to say
I guess the pandemic's over?

14
00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.578
It kinda is. right?

15
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:24.709
I mean. nobody gives a fuck anymore.
so basically. it's over. right?

16
00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:28.213
It killed all the weak people. you know?

17
00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.382
The strong people are here to survive.

18
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.552
The fatties are gone. the asthmatics.

19
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.012
people with lisps.

20
00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.347
None of 'em made it!

21
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.437
But you guys survived.

22
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.981
Yeah. you guys survived.

23
00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.111
Yeah. they said it killed a whole bunch
of people. but I gotta be honest.

24
00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.530
Have you really noticed?

25
00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.784
I mean. you drive down the highway.
there's still traffic.

26
00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.786
I thought it was gonna be like. "Wow!

27
00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.330
Holy shit. a lot of people died.

28
00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:06.960
That's so sad. but fucking awesome.
all at the same time!"

29
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.130
I gotta be honest though.

30
00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.841
I saw a lot of you youngsters
didn't wear masks.

31
00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.050
I got upset at first.

32
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.970
but then I did the math.
I understand why you didn't wear 'em.

33
00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.472
You know what I mean?
You knew you were gonna survive.

34
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.765
Right?

35
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.185
You went to college. You bought the dream.

36
00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.980
You left with the debt
and there was no jobs.

37
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.525
So you played the only card you had.

38
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.862
Get COVID and breathe on somebody older

39
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.321
with a corner office.

40
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.576
That's what you do. all right?

41
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.037
Power is not given away.
It has to be taken.

42
00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.874
And people have to die.

43
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.333
historically speaking.

44
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.545
People have to go.

45
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.050
You know what did amaze me
during all of this?

46
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.636
Was the amount of shit that doctors got

47
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.391
from non-doctors...
slash complete fucking morons.

48
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.685
People who had to go to summer school.

49
00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.730
"According to my Internet research.

50
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:12.984
if you take a little bleach.
vitamin D and aspirinâ€¦"

51
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.653
And people are like. listening to 'em.

52
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.575
Like. my favorite heckle doctors got
from people was. like.

53
00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:23.620
"Dude. what's the last thing
they even cured?

54
00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.413
What?

55
00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.749
Fucking polio?"

56
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.044
It's like. "No. HPV."

57
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.547
They just came out with a vaccine for HPV.

58
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.133
No more warts on your dick.

59
00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:41.512
We should be carrying these people
around on our shoulders.

60
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:42.680
Thank you...

61
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.851
for not having to make me go down
to the doctor.

62
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.145
And be like.
"That's not a birthmark. is it?"

63
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.397
Or even worse. you're too shy to go.

64
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.483
so you try to do self-surgery

65
00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:57.445
with a frozen Bud Light can.
"Stick it on there. freeze it off!"

66
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.118
Bud Light. one of the big sponsors
of this comedy tonight.

67
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:10.375
They say that. "What was the last
thing they cured?" How about AIDS?

68
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.460
Dude. AIDS was gonna kill everybody.

69
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.836
You get it from fucking.

70
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.047
It was over.
Now look at it.

71
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.800
Now you can get it.
they give you one pill.

72
00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.885
It doesn't even show up on a test!

73
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.097
You can go out and bang somebody.
no condom. they don't even get it!

74
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.599
According to my Internet research!

75
00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.854
Don't listen to me. but I think
that's what I overheard in a bar.

76
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.775
"What's the last thing they cured?"

77
00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.736
Do you know what fake legs looked like
when I was a kid?

78
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.030
Huh?

79
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:45.702
First of all. there was only one color.
it was like Band-Aid color.

80
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.996
And everybody knew you had a fake leg.

81
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.833
You're fucking walking down the street and
everybody... "He's got a fake leg!

82
00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.878
What do you think happened?" Motorcycle
accident. fell down a flight of stairs.

83
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.047
got impatient with a woodchipper.

84
00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.965
Right?

85
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.887
Everybody knew you had a fake leg.

86
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.348
Now. if you have fake legs.

87
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:11.019
you're not allowed
to compete with people with real legs

88
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:16.232
in the Olympics. because not
having legs is now more of an advantage

89
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.817
than having real legs.

90
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.779
Doctors make better legs than God.

91
00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:28.369
All right. your calves. and your feet
flopping around. are no match for a couple

92
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:29.454
of sickles.

93
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.332
These people just skiing down
the fucking street.

94
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.460
You get 'em by some train tracks
that go downhill.

95
00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.295
you're never gonna see 'em again!

96
00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:44.260
I enjoyed people being their own doctors.
I loved it.

97
00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.846
Good. kill yourselves. kill yourselves.

98
00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.807
There's too many of us. it's fantastic.

99
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:55.563
All right. this is a weird thing to say
in LA. but I'm really into guns.

100
00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.233
I do. I love guns.

101
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:03.279
I don't own a gun. I didn't grow up
with them. so. I know that I'm an idiot.

102
00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:07.033
so I'll probably kill myself. but I don't
have a problem with guns. you know?

103
00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:10.411
Liberals gotta quit trying to take away
conservative people's guns.

104
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.163
they just gotta stop doing that shit.

105
00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:14.457
Because when you try
to take away their guns.

106
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.167
then you get them in a corner where

107
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.003
they gotta start defending everybody
with a gun. You know?

108
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.631
Like that fucking idiot.
Rittenhouse. right?

109
00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:22.590
That moron.

110
00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:25.760
And they're gonna sit there like.
"No. he's a bright guy.

111
00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.929
He was a good guy with a gun."

112
00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.599
My favorite thing about that
was why did he go up there?

113
00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:35.186
It's like. "Well. he loved his town.
He loved it."

114
00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:39.398
It's like. "Oh. yeah. when it snows out.
does he show up with a shovel?"

115
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.985
"Private Rittenhouse. reporting for duty.

116
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.989
Boy. oh boy. do I love this sidewalk.

117
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.491
My goodness."

118
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.957
I'll tell ya. that guy went
there to feel threatened.

119
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.043
And he felt threatened
and he fucking killed two people.

120
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:03.297
Turns out the two people he killed
were a convicted child molester.

121
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.966
and a skateboarder.

122
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.427
Two of the most annoying people
in society.

123
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:14.142
So as dumb as this kid is.
he somehow went two for two.

124
00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.561
Unbelievable!

125
00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:21.357
It's like when they bring some fat guy out
of the crowd. halftime at an NBA game.

126
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:26.195
"You hit this half-court shot. fatty.
you could win a Dodge-- fucking Durango."

127
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.572
"All right."

128
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.948
[shouts]

129
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:29.907
[blows air]

130
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.951
"Nothing but net! Holy shit!"

131
00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:36.247
Yeah. Rittenhouse did it twice.
"I got the other side!

132
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.290
Bam!

133
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.918
Skateboarder. go fuck yourself!"

134
00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.132
People try to say
his mother drove him to the riot.

135
00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:49.844
I don't believe that. I think that's some
liberal horseshit they made up.

136
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:53.014
I just can't imagine that conversation
going down like that.

137
00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:56.434
Like. she's sitting at home.
hears him upstairs and is like. "Honey!

138
00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.228
Honey. what are you doing?

139
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.857
You going out tonight?
What are you doing?"

140
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.984
"Going to a riot."

141
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.945
"Do you want a ride?"

142
00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:13.201
"All right. but you gotta drop me off
like two blocks away.

143
00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:17.580
so my other racist friends
don't see my mommy drove me."

144
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.751
"All right.
are you gonna wear a jacket?"

145
00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:22.752
"Mom!"

146
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.926
"Don't yell at me the way your father did!

147
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.594
And bring your AR-15.

148
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.013
I'll see you in the car."

149
00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:37.975
I don't know about that dude.

150
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.562
Only thing I can say about that dude
is I hope he never does a 23andMe.

151
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:45.858
Okay. because with those big pouty lips
I don't think he's gonna like the results.

152
00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:52.323
Then he's gonna have to go down
to the hideout. knocking on the door.

153
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.493
"Come on. man. I'm like 91% you."

154
00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:59.455
<i>"Und the FÃ¼hrer </i>only accepts
100% percent Caucasian!"

155
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.917
All right. give yourselves
a round of applause. everybody!

156
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.834
[applause]

157
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.045
We're gonna keep this show going.

158
00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:09.465
We've got nothing.
nothing but killers on this show.

159
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.467
You guys are an awesome crowd.

160
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.762
and I can't think
of a better way to start this show.

161
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:16.681
This is one of my favorite joke writers
out there.

162
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:18.599
She's written for all
the late-night shows.

163
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.352
even performed for a president.
and she's here tonight for you.

164
00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.646
Please welcome the amazing Michelle Wolf!

165
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.356
Come on. everybody!

166
00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:28.985
[cheers and applause]

167
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.371
Give it up for Bill!

168
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.124
[cheers and applause]

169
00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:47.753
You know. we're both redheads. I don't
know if this is a show or a fetish.

170
00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:53.134
I. um. I want women to get ahead.

171
00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:55.678
[light whooping]

172
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.305
Yeah. we only needed four.

173
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.893
I want women to get ahead. but I just
don't know if it's gonna happen.

174
00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:06.772
Because. uh. we're not good at it.

175
00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.359
Like. we have the first female
vice president.

176
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.570
and everyone got really excited.

177
00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:15.364
They were like.
"Now little girls everywhere.

178
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.326
little girls everywhere

179
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:19.910
will know it's possible."

180
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:25.625
Yeah. little girls everywhere else
already knew it was possible.

181
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.086
America's like the last place
to have a female leader.

182
00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.007
She's not even really... the leader.

183
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:41.140
We're like. the last place to have
a female leader.

184
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:46.604
Kosovo's been a country for 13 years.
they've already had two female leaders.

185
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:51.484
Germany had Angela Merkel
for I don't know how long.

186
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:53.944
long enough for me
to know it's "An-guh-lah."

187
00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:01.160
Myanmar's one of the least
developed countries in Asia.

188
00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:05.373
It's had a female leader who's been
overthrown by the military twice!

189
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:10.586
And each time. that little Asian lady
claws her way back up to the top.

190
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:16.425
She is definitely not a white woman.

191
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.595
She would've just stayed down
and been like. "This is not fair."

192
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.684
"Little girls everywhereâ€¦"

193
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.147
Some people make the argument.
they're like. "Well. some people

194
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.484
just need to see it happen
to know it's possible."

195
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:36.487
All right. well then. you're not a leader.

196
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.824
That's like the exact opposite definition
of a leader.

197
00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.618
Like. "Guys. I'm gonna show you the way.

198
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.413
if you could just--
if I could follow you maybe."

199
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.084
And use that anywhere else.
you're in school.

200
00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:52.795
You're in school.
you're looking at someone's paper.

201
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.754
and they're like--

202
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.298
the teacher comes up to you
and she's like. "What are you doing?"

203
00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.677
And you're like.
"I just need to know it was possible."

204
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.763
"Little girls."

205
00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:06.475
And they only do this
when good things happen to women.

206
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.811
They don't do this
when bad things happen to women

207
00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.355
or when women achieve bad things.

208
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:15.067
You know. like when <i>Two Girls. One Cup</i>
came out. no one was like...

209
00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:20.781
"Now little girls everywhereâ€¦"

210
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.708
I make fun of white women a lot.

211
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.836
But only because it's fun and easy.

212
00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:37.798
You know?

213
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.051
And white women.
we blame a lot of stuff on white men.

214
00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:45.473
We blame a lot of stuff on white men.
which I think is a little bit crazy

215
00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:47.224
because we did make you.

216
00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.938
It's just made me very sure of one thing.

217
00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:57.318
White women should never be allowed
to make robots.

218
00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:01.906
Before you get all. like huffy.
I'm not saying you can't make robots.

219
00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:04.116
although I doubt it a little bit.

220
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.534
I'm not--

221
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:09.413
I'm just saying you
should never be <i>allowed </i>to make robots.

222
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.290
because if robots get out of hand

223
00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:14.168
and start taking over everything
and being real evil.

224
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:17.505
white women will be like.
"Well. I don't know. I just love 'em."

225
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.258
"I mean. not my robot."

226
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.681
Not all white women are bad.

227
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:30.684
Some white women really do try
to put in the work.

228
00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:32.353
They try to do good things.

229
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:34.563
You know. like. uh. two summers ago.

230
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.691
we realized that Black lives matter.

231
00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.492
Then we fixed it. We did.

232
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:54.416
Waiting till two summers ago
to realize Black lives matter

233
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.711
is like needing to see that documentary
to know SeaWorld is bad.

234
00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:01.757
Like. "Did you know whales
shouldn't live in a sink?"

235
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.475
But white women. they really put
in the work. you know?

236
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:16.438
We protested.
We made signs. We really tried.

237
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.734
But then something terrible happened
to a lot of white women.

238
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.570
Something terrible happened to us.

239
00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:26.949
Some of us realized that we've actually
been racist this whole time.

240
00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:29.827
We were shocked!

241
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.496
We were so shocked.
we pulled our purse closer.

242
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.879
But after that. we were like.
"Well. from now on.

243
00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.423
we're gonna learn. we're gonna listen.

244
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:46.510
we're gonna hear. we're gonna open
a small Black business.

245
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:51.348
But most importantly. from now on.

246
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.101
we're gonna do better.
We wanna do better."

247
00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:59.398
And all jokes aside. I think that's the
only way forward for us as a society.

248
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:04.236
You can't change the past.
All you can do is better moving forward.

249
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.281
And I think that's what
we should try to do.

250
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:09.158
[cheers and applause]

251
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:10.910
Except...

252
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:16.123
that's almost exactly
the same thing men said about #MeToo.

253
00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:19.043
and we found that answer
completely unacceptable.

254
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.756
Men were like.
"Us? The whole time?"

255
00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.842
"Well. from now on.
we're gonna learn.

256
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.179
we're gonna listen.

257
00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:34.475
we're gonna hear.
we're gonna open a small Black business.

258
00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:40.481
But most importantly. from now on.
we're gonna do better.

259
00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:41.941
We wanna do better."

260
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:45.319
And we were like.
"No! Not good enough!

261
00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:47.279
You all have to die!

262
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.325
It doesn't matter what you did.
you could've raped somebody

263
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.285
or accidentally whispered into a boob.

264
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.536
It's all the same!

265
00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.414
And you have to die!"

266
00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:01.835
#MeToo was
the worst-run movement I've ever seen.

267
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.463
We ran #MeToo like Amelia Earhart.

268
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.261
We crashed it immediately.

269
00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.890
It should've been a conversation.

270
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:18.102
We needed to have a conversation about
these things. and you weren't even allowed

271
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.269
to ask questions.

272
00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:22.648
And I know men had questions.
because I had questions.

273
00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:27.069
Like I'd hear some women say something
that was a #MeToo. and I'd be like.

274
00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:31.156
"Hey. the thing that you just said is a
#MeToo. is actually a thing that I like."

275
00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:37.913
So how do we tell men about that?

276
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.960
Some women would be like. "Men shouldn't
use their power to have sex."

277
00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:44.503
And then other women would be like.

278
00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:47.256
"I like it when men use their power
to have sex."

279
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.010
And then men were like.
"Can you tell us which one you are?

280
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:55.431
And we were like.
"No! But for different reasons."

281
00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:01.186
Some women would be like.
"This man. he hit on me at work.

282
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.064
It made me uncomfortable.
That's harassment."

283
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:07.234
It's like. "Okay. so do you
want no one to hit on you at work?"

284
00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.778
"No. I only want the men
who I want to hit on me

285
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.196
to hit on me at work."

286
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.536
"Okay. do you wanna
make. like. a list of who they are?"

287
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.413
"No. I'm mysterious."

288
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.126
"Well then. buckle up.
Nancy Drew.

289
00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.837
you've got some uncomfortable
times headed your way."

290
00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:31.258
White women. we do this all the time.
we say. "You made me uncomfortable.

291
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.636
I'm uncomfortable."
Like we're supposed to be comfortable.

292
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.848
I've never been comfortable once
in my entire life.

293
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.560
When I'm about to fall asleep.
at my most relaxed.

294
00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:46.023
when I'm about to fall asleep. my body
jerks awake. like. "Never rest. bitch!"

295
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:53.322
We say everything makes us uncomfortable--
men. women--

296
00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.449
We say women make us uncomfortable.

297
00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.242
That's the one I hate the most.

298
00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.871
We say women of color. all the time.
we tell them they make us uncomfortable.

299
00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:03.207
Like. a couple of years ago.
at the Super Bowl.

300
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.918
we say J. Lo and Shakira
made us uncomfortable.

301
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.212
A couple years before that
at the Super Bowl.

302
00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.047
we said BeyoncÃ© made us uncomfortable.

303
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.800
A couple years before that
at the Super Bowl.

304
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.594
we said Janet Jackson
made us uncomfortable.

305
00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:19.389
I think a lot of white women only see
women of color at the Super Bowl.

306
00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:23.143
They're like.
"This show is different than <i>Friends."</i>

307
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.648
But this one makes me so mad.

308
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:31.735
because this one.
women. we say it's family values.

309
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:36.657
We say. "How dare those women move their
hips like that in front of my children

310
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.118
and my husband. It's immoral."

311
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:41.245
I don't think that's the word you meant.

312
00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.413
I think you meant "jealous."

313
00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:50.295
"How dare you show my husband
how hips can move like mine can't."

314
00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:55.050
You ever seen a white woman try to twerk?

315
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.302
You ever seen it?

316
00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:01.765
It looks like Pinocchio trying to walk
as a real boy for the first time.

317
00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.101
Just like...

318
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.525
"Am I doing it?"

319
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:15.654
Thank you. guys. very much.
I'm Michelle Wolf. have a good night.

320
00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.197
[cheers and applause]

321
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.032
[Burr] Michelle Wolf. everybody!

322
00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.869
Michelle Wolf. come on!

323
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:26.540
Killing it. killing it.

324
00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:29.585
All right. you guys hanging in there.
you're having a good time. right?

325
00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.670
Just keeps getting better.

326
00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:34.381
All right. this next guy comes all the way
from London. England.

327
00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:36.550
one of the biggest comics out there.

328
00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:40.304
he has a great special out called
<i>His Dark Material </i>on Netflix.

329
00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:43.724
please welcome the one and only
Jimmy Carr. everybody. come on!

330
00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:45.934
[cheers and applause]

331
00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:46.852
Nice.

332
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:51.690
Okay.

333
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.239
Thank you. thank you very much.

334
00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:04.494
Well. good evening. ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Jimmy Carr.

335
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.663
It's great to be with you here
this evening.

336
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:08.498
I'll tell you why it's great to be here.

337
00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:11.501
We're drinking. my friends.
in the Last Chance Saloon.

338
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:15.923
What I'm saying onstage tonight
is barely acceptable now.

339
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:20.177
In ten years' time.
fucking forget about it.

340
00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:24.306
You're gonna be able to tell your
grandchildren about seeing this show.

341
00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:25.891
Yeah.

342
00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.645
You'll say.
"I saw a man. and he stood on stage.

343
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.689
and he made light of serious situations.

344
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.484
We used to call them jokes.

345
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.779
And people would laugh."

346
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.324
And your grandchildren
will ask. they'll say.

347
00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:44.993
"Non-binary elder."

348
00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.955
[laughter]

349
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:54.670
"Non-binary elder.
what's a joke?"

350
00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:58.924
And you'll say. "You are."

351
00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:09.476
I say you can joke about anything.
but not with anyone.

352
00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:12.896
I think with you good people this evening.
I should be fine. right?

353
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.606
[audience cheers]

354
00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.361
Well. let's see. shall we?

355
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.197
We'll put that to the test.

356
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:29.329
Having sex is like riding a bikeâ€¦
my uncle taught me when I was a kid.

357
00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.006
People say the best things
in life are free.

358
00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:41.758
but those people have clearly
never had sex.

359
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.768
I like it when the girl puts the condom
on for you.

360
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.229
but I was asked to leave the pharmacy.

361
00:21:58.942 --> 00:22:02.696
My girlfriend doesn't think that her
sister is trustworthy. but believe me.

362
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:04.656
that girl can keep a secret.

363
00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.833
Is anyone here
in a controlling relationship?

364
00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:16.251
Raise your partner's hand.

365
00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:19.546
Yes.

366
00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:30.599
I want One Direction to do a BTS covers
medley at my funeral. because that way.

367
00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.017
I'll be glad I'm dead.

368
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:39.524
Now. you might think this is silly.
but I assure you it's absolutely true.

369
00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:44.654
When Zane left One Direction.
for me. it was like 9/11.

370
00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:48.784
Yeah. I didn't care about that either.

371
00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.876
Well. there's a real generational
divide there. I can seeâ€¦

372
00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:02.005
Some people are looking at me like.
"9/11. steady on."

373
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.049
And other people
are looking at me like.

374
00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:06.551
"One Direction.
don't take their name in vain!"

375
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.642
I was actually supposed to be on one
of the planes on 9/11.

376
00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:16.311
But the more interesting story
is how I met Osama.

377
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.323
When you're young. pedophiles are
something to laugh at. the local creep.

378
00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:33.328
But then you grow up. have your own kids.
with their own unique personalities

379
00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:36.456
and quirks and difficulties.
and it suddenly hits you.

380
00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:39.835
"What the fuck do these pedos
see in these little shits?"

381
00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.176
I can do a brilliant Michael Jackson
impersonation.

382
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.761
would you like to see it?

383
00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.221
[audience cheers]

384
00:23:52.013 --> 00:23:55.642
Okay. I just need a young volunteer who
can keep a secret. come on up.

385
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:57.352
Yeah.

386
00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:59.229
What are you getting up for?

387
00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:02.524
Wait a second. this is a teachable moment.

388
00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:05.694
If a grown man beckons you forth.

389
00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:08.029
as he undoes his flies.

390
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.825
this is some stranger danger. son.

391
00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:14.452
What's your name?

392
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:16.246
-Mikey.
-[Carr] Mikey.

393
00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:18.415
Let's hear it for Mikey. everyone.

394
00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:20.876
That-- because. you know why?

395
00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.088
That is commitment to a night out
at a comedy show.

396
00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:28.508
That is a young man
that's thought to himself.

397
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:31.219
"Oh. it's the bit in the show
where I suck his cock. Great!"

398
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.059
Everyone loved Michael Jackson
in the '80s. right?

399
00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:41.771
He was the coolest guy in the world.
Coolest guy in the world. bar none.

400
00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:45.859
And really. the high point of that cool
was the moonwalk at the Grammys.

401
00:24:45.942 --> 00:24:48.486
Remember that? People lost their minds
at how cool it was.

402
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.406
when really. the moonwalk was no more
than-- it was that.

403
00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:56.536
I know I'm not nailing this.
but that was the gist of it. right?

404
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.539
That was the coolest shit
we'd ever fucking seen!

405
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:02.667
Of course. we didn't realize at the time.
it had been developed

406
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:05.670
for sneaking in and out
of children's bedrooms. We had no idea.

407
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:08.965
It's so obvious now.

408
00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:12.219
Now. I've never fucked a kid.

409
00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:14.221
I nearly did just then. didn't I?

410
00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.765
But I've never fucked a kid.

411
00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:19.935
But if I did fuck a kid. I think I know
how I'd leave the room.

412
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.735
Do you remember the incident in the '90s
with Michael Jackson?

413
00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:33.073
Where he was on tour in Germany?
He had the whole top floor of a hotel?

414
00:25:33.156 --> 00:25:38.912
And he had the baby. and he held the baby
over the balcony. and he shook the baby.

415
00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:40.914
Crazy.

416
00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:44.042
You can't get cum off a baby like that.

417
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:51.424
[cheers and applause]

418
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.553
Somewhat ironically that has really
separated the men from the boys.

419
00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:56.721
hasn't it?

420
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:01.601
I've been Jimmy Carr.
thank you very much indeed.

421
00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:03.061
Cheers. Good night. Thank you.

422
00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.021
Cheers.

423
00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:07.274
[Burr] Jimmy Carr. everybody.

424
00:26:08.483 --> 00:26:10.485
Not bad for a foreigner. huh?

425
00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:13.571
Yeah. he comes from England.

426
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:16.241
That's ground zero
for white people right there.

427
00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:17.951
Yes. it is.

428
00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:22.330
That's why I got the vaccine. because they
were testing it out in England first.

429
00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:26.835
And I'm like. "That's the whitest fucking
place ever. That shit must work." Right?

430
00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:30.797
If they tried it out initially in Haiti.
I'd be like. "All right.

431
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.967
My people are up
to their old tricks again."

432
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.469
"Are they putting it in blankets?"

433
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:39.222
"Oh!" It happened.

434
00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:41.474
You're groaning history.
you fucking pussies.

435
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:44.311
All right. let's keep this show
moving along.

436
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:47.731
This next comedian. I actually just
saw a clip of her on Instagram

437
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:50.025
a couple months ago
and instantly became a huge fan.

438
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.610
She's absolutely hilarious.
I love her to death.

439
00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:55.822
Please welcome Steph Tolev. everybody.
Come on. Steph Tolev.

440
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:57.282
[cheers and applause]

441
00:26:57.365 --> 00:26:58.950
-[Burr] Welcome back.
-[Tolev shouts]

442
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:00.785
Hey!

443
00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:02.620
How the hell are we?

444
00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:07.334
This is nice. 'scuse me.
gotta air out the puss. huh?

445
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.463
Gotta let the big ol' gal breathe a bit.
huh. ladies?

446
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.175
Take in a deep. big breath of air. huh?

447
00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:17.177
I'm wearing shorts. what are you. 16?

448
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.929
You're like. "Whoopsies.
excuse me. how are we?"

449
00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:21.598
I'm kidding. I check IDs.

450
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:23.391
How are we? This is fun.

451
00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.352
How do we like the mullet?

452
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:27.896
[audience cheers]

453
00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:30.940
Okay. now that's a reaction!

454
00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:32.984
Did any straight men clap?

455
00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:37.322
Not enough of you. not enough!

456
00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.616
Damn it all to hell.

457
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:42.952
I am straight. and this haircut is not
fucking helping me.

458
00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:47.749
Neither is anything I'm doing right now.
Does this help. if I take a knee?

459
00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.125
Is this what men like?

460
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:51.711
When a gal gets down like this?

461
00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:54.631
I'm straight. I'll prove it right now.
I swear to God.

462
00:27:54.714 --> 00:27:57.467
Little guy. get up here. I'll jerk you off
right now. I swear to God.

463
00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:00.678
Bring your little friend.
I'll do you both at the same time.

464
00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:02.680
Yeah! Fuck!

465
00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.433
Like those ropes in the gym...

466
00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.269
All right! Here we go! Fuck!

467
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:10.688
I'll make 'em slap. don't worry.

468
00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:13.149
Oh. it's not gonna feel good. no. no. no.

469
00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.443
No. you're not gonna like it at all.

470
00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:20.115
I'll make sure you finish. don't worry.
[laughs evilly]

471
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.741
It'll take a while.

472
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:26.746
I'm so sorry.
I don't wanna be like this. um...

473
00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.706
I've tried women. I have.

474
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.418
You're like. "We know."
I've tried several times.

475
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.420
I keep ending up down there. I'm like.

476
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:35.547
"This again?
What the heck am I eating out?"

477
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.966
I finish my plate though.
I'm not rude.

478
00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:40.969
I'm not gonna leave it. that's rude.
I lick the whole thing clean.

479
00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:43.555
What am I. a waste? I don't think so.

480
00:28:43.638 --> 00:28:46.641
Oh. I'm not a rude person. I swear to God.

481
00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:49.728
Dating in LA is a nightmare. can we agree?

482
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:51.646
It's a fucking piece of shit. dating here?

483
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.814
-[light cheering]
-Yeah.

484
00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.984
Four people. the rest of you are in love.
Go suck my ass.

485
00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:57.360
Pieces of shit.

486
00:28:57.444 --> 00:29:00.739
I'm a boiled ham
in Los Angeles on Tinder.

487
00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:03.992
Don't-- Relax. I'm a hot piece
in Grand Rapids. Michigan.

488
00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:05.160
So don't worry.

489
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:07.829
Yeah. get my tits sucked right off

490
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.706
in Michigan. feels good.

491
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:13.752
I will say though. I did clean up on
Tinder in LA during the pandemic because.

492
00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:17.380
ooh. all the hot boys. you got real sad.
didn't ya?

493
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:20.633
You got real lonely.

494
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.178
And you got real desperate.

495
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:28.099
And all the pretty blond girls
didn't swipe right. did they?

496
00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:32.228
Guess who did? [laughs]

497
00:29:32.312 --> 00:29:35.940
Old Stephy T. crawled out of the well.
[laughs]

498
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.485
Oh yeah. I fucked a bunch of tens.

499
00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:39.778
Felt good. felt good.

500
00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:43.072
Yeah. thank you. it felt good to be on top
for once. it really did.

501
00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:46.159
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

502
00:29:46.242 --> 00:29:49.370
One cried. Paul.
Yeah. he was very upset.

503
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.791
He's like. "Can we please turn lights
off?" I'm like. "We're keeping them on."

504
00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:56.920
I was being disgusting during
the pandemic. just being a gross person.

505
00:29:57.003 --> 00:29:58.296
I was having sex outside.

506
00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:01.007
I'm like. "You can't get COVID
if you're in a field."

507
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.220
You can get chlamydia. though.
You can. you can.

508
00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:10.433
Yeah. but is it chlamydia
if all of the STD clinics are closed?

509
00:30:12.393 --> 00:30:15.647
Yeah. it was chlamydia. yeah. for sure.
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

510
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.483
You need a pill for that drip.
big time. big time.

511
00:30:20.693 --> 00:30:22.821
Only person who's had an STD. shut up.

512
00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:25.740
I'll come by and check your underwear
one by one.

513
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:28.409
You're like. "This is very strange.
please don't."

514
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.662
Are you pigs still 69-ing out there?

515
00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:32.956
[audience cheering]

516
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.918
Disgusting. every last one of you.
I think it should be a federal offense.

517
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.379
You should be arrested on sight
for doing it.

518
00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:40.880
It's for young. hot. thin people.

519
00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:44.634
You get older. you get bigger.
things get slippy. things get sloppy.

520
00:30:45.885 --> 00:30:48.847
I got duped by a man at 10:00 a.m.
with two rattails.

521
00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:51.224
It's a lot to unpack.

522
00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:52.642
Take that in for a second.

523
00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.937
Two rattails?
One rattail too many.

524
00:30:57.313 --> 00:30:59.774
Two rattails?
Two too many.

525
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.318
10:00 a.m.. 69 lady?

526
00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:04.112
No one's ready for that.

527
00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:07.991
On all fours. sun beaming directly
into your asshole.

528
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.787
Oh. you all have pristine anuses
in this room?

529
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.247
I don't think so.

530
00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:17.375
The same mullet on my head.
also over my asshole.

531
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:20.378
Doesn't matter how many times I shave.

532
00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:22.630
There's a couple stragglers
back there. huh?

533
00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:27.844
Couple loosies peeking out to say.
"Hello! Miss me?"

534
00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.265
I'm on all fours. sucking in.

535
00:31:32.348 --> 00:31:34.684
I'm tucking in. everything's hanging out.

536
00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:37.979
Oh. only one other woman
has a fat labia? Yeah. right.

537
00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.900
No one has the old dog tongue.
just hanging out the side?

538
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:44.444
I'm the only one? Relax.

539
00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:49.824
I'm holding onto his ankles.
his feet are so dirty for some reason.

540
00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:54.537
Covered with hair and crumbs. I'm like.
"Where were you before this. man?

541
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:58.833
"Walking around a play place?
Turn on a sock. what are you doing?"

542
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.211
Looking at his long.
disgusting balls.

543
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:05.506
I'm like. "I don't think they're supposed
to be stretched out like this. why is it?

544
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.426
It just looks like something
ran it over before you got here.

545
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.804
You need to seek medical attention
immediately after this."

546
00:32:13.014 --> 00:32:16.851
Sniffing the tip
of his disgusting penis.

547
00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:21.314
Every man in this room thinks that women
smell down there.

548
00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:25.526
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.
but. your cock fucking reeks.

549
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.444
Sorry.

550
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:28.321
Excuse me.

551
00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:31.407
Yeah. the guys got real quiet. huh?

552
00:32:32.158 --> 00:32:35.203
Let's see who we got here. guy
in the front row. You've got a stinker.

553
00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:40.124
You've got an old. tiny.
middle of a book stink. huh?

554
00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:43.044
The Old Testament. this guy smells like.

555
00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:48.800
So easy to clean it. simple stuff.

556
00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:52.303
Go to the bathroom. fill up the sink.
dip him in.

557
00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:57.350
Splish splash. just the tip. mwah.
a little smooch to the water.

558
00:32:58.184 --> 00:33:00.937
You don't think every girl in here
has gone to freshen up?

559
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.357
You guys know what freshening up means?
When we go. "Be right back!"

560
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.316
[laughs]

561
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:08.736
In the bathroom.
sink on. leg up. full blast like...

562
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.531
"Fuck me! Fuck!

563
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:13.116
He's gonna know!"

564
00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:18.287
Using that watered-down soap.
if there's no suds. that's no longer soap.

565
00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:20.748
That's water in a jar.

566
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:25.044
Using that crusted towel.
just wipes the water around.

567
00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.422
Come out dripping. he's like.
"You ready to go?"

568
00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:31.884
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm horny. let's fucking
do this. You made me so wet."

569
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:36.222
Men don't like funny women.

570
00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:38.474
You say you do. you say you want it.
No. you don't.

571
00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.184
No you don't. you're liars.

572
00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:41.602
Especially in the bedroom.

573
00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:45.231
Not the time. not the place.
don't bring the jokes to the boudoir.

574
00:33:45.314 --> 00:33:48.818
Kept doing this one bit where I take out
a guy's dick and go. "Is this thing on?"

575
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:50.528
Never got a laugh. not once.

576
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.698
Did it for a year. it was like.
"Read the room."

577
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:55.825
Kept doing this other bit.
this one I had to stop

578
00:33:55.908 --> 00:33:58.369
because guys were getting
freaked out before we'd finish up.

579
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:02.832
He'd be like. "Oh. what do I do with
the condom?" I'm like. "I'll take that."

580
00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:05.334
"I'm saving it for later!"

581
00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:08.796
And I would pretend that I had a weird

582
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.550
mini-fridge in my room for some reason.
I'm like. "It's still warm." [growls]

583
00:34:13.092 --> 00:34:16.471
I'm like. "Why am I acting like a gargoyle
the second sex is finished?"

584
00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:19.223
So if anybody wants
to come back to my well tonight.

585
00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:21.476
I got a little bit more room
in the fridge. [growls]

586
00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.936
Thank you so much. my name is Steph Tolev.

587
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.772
[cheers and applause]

588
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.816
Steph Tolev. everybody. Steph Tolev.

589
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:29.734
Come on!

590
00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:33.780
Amazing. amazing.

591
00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:38.242
"Middle of a book stink."
I don't think I'll forget that.

592
00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:43.289
I don't even read.
and I know what that smells like.

593
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:47.794
The next people coming to the stage.
two of my favorite comedians

594
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:50.880
actually come out together and do
something called "Bumping Mics."

595
00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:54.133
Please welcome Jeff Ross and Dave Attell.

596
00:34:54.675 --> 00:34:56.427
[cheers and applause]

597
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.553
What's up?

598
00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:01.641
Here you go. Boom!

599
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:03.643
Bump it out!

600
00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:06.229
-How's it going. everybody?
-Bump it out!

601
00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:07.188
Yes!

602
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:10.191
That's what I'm talking about!

603
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:11.359
Awesome!

604
00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:14.445
-Yeah!
-Look at it.

605
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:15.947
This is amazing. Dave.

606
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.032
-Welcome to Hollywood. baby.
-We did it.

607
00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:21.285
Netflix is a Joke Comedy Festival.
what do you think?

608
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:24.372
Dude. I am so excited.
I gotta tell you something.

609
00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:28.417
First of all. I haven't seen this guy
in like. three variants.

610
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:29.877
And you know.

611
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:33.297
Jeff. I know. um.
you can't stay all night

612
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:36.509
because you have to get up early
to work security at a food court.

613
00:35:36.592 --> 00:35:37.552
But. um...

614
00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:41.305
Thanks. Dave.

615
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:42.890
It's a slamfest. my friend.

616
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:45.893
I'm gonna be nice to you.
I don't wanna tease you because...

617
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:47.603
you know. Dave and I.

618
00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:50.356
Dave's had some health issues.
we have the same doctor.

619
00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:54.402
My proctologist is Dave's
ear. nose. and throat doctor.

620
00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:57.613
Jeff. you know what?

621
00:35:57.697 --> 00:36:00.366
Dave'sâ€¦ I'm gonna
keep going. motherfucker.

622
00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:02.910
Go ahead. buddy.
hit me with something already.

623
00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.705
Dave's not on TikTok.
but he does have seconds to live.

624
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:09.500
Everyone loves a math joke.

625
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:12.336
-Can I do some more? Can I-- Hold on!
-Dave how long have you...

626
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.671
-Can I do some...
-No!

627
00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:17.383
Dave's not just a good comedian.
he's also a great impressionist.

628
00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:20.720
Every night he does an impression
of Amber Heard when he shits his bed.

629
00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:24.765
Oh. dude. all right. that's it.

630
00:36:25.933 --> 00:36:27.560
Hey. it's time for me to go.

631
00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:28.728
All right?

632
00:36:28.811 --> 00:36:31.272
Jeff. you know. I have to tell you this.
all right?

633
00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:34.192
You're the kind of guy who buys a gerbil.
but keeps the receipt.

634
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:36.402
just in case it doesn't fit.
All right?

635
00:36:36.903 --> 00:36:38.863
They grow. they grow.

636
00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:40.948
I'm just telling you. buddy.

637
00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.034
I don't care. Dave.
I'm feeling invincible.

638
00:36:43.117 --> 00:36:45.328
I just got my 38th vaccine shot.

639
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:46.287
[Attell] Sweet.

640
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.498
Johnson & Johnson & Johnson
& Johnson & Johnson & Johnson...

641
00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:50.499
[Attell] That's the best.

642
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:54.253
I've been licking strangers' assholes
at the airport all day. I feel great.

643
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:55.171
Oh. why not?

644
00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:57.215
Did you get vaccinated?

645
00:36:57.298 --> 00:36:59.800
Well. I'm old. so I got mine in 1919.

646
00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:03.179
You know. it was me. Chaplin. and...

647
00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:07.516
This crowd's so young. they don't even
know what we're talking about here.

648
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.103
I got COVID.
Any other COVID survivors?

649
00:37:11.187 --> 00:37:12.980
[audience cheers]

650
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.316
Anybody else lose their sense of taste?

651
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:19.654
I went to see the Dave Matthews Band
at the Greek.

652
00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:24.575
-Nice one.
-Thanks.

653
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:25.534
[Attell] Wow.

654
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:28.746
It was touch and go with Nickelback
for a while. but I'm okay now.

655
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:30.665
Jeff. you're killing it tonight.

656
00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:32.250
It's good times. Dave.

657
00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:35.711
And look at this crowd. dude. I know how
you love to jump into the crowd.

658
00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:37.630
You are the Roastmaster.
Are you going down?

659
00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:40.341
Go down. buddy.
Get down there.

660
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.719
Here he comes. everyone. the Roastmaster.

661
00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:44.929
[Ross] Oh. look at this guy.

662
00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.139
Fully vaxxed. fully waxed.

663
00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:49.475
All right. Who wants to say hi?
You want to say hi?

664
00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:51.227
-Stand up for a second.
-Oh.

665
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.312
Look. it's Dave Chappelle's
security guard.

666
00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:54.230
Wow.

667
00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:57.525
I got a question for this guy.

668
00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.277
-What?
-What's your name. buddy?

669
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.236
My name's Ari.

670
00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:02.405
Ari. what time does Legoland open?

671
00:38:02.488 --> 00:38:03.864
I wanna know...

672
00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:08.619
Who you here with. Ari?
The rest of the <i>yeshiva?</i>

673
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.250
This guy right here.
the whole cast of <i>Squid Game.</i>

674
00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:15.918
-[Attell] Yes!
-Thank you for coming.

675
00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:19.714
I won a lot of money on you. man.
Way to go.

676
00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.841
This is like an infomercial for My Pillow.

677
00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:22.800
I love it.

678
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:24.844
Miss. how ya doing?

679
00:38:24.927 --> 00:38:27.263
Dave. you have a cat joke for this woman?

680
00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:28.180
Nice.

681
00:38:29.682 --> 00:38:31.642
-What's your name?
-Kat.

682
00:38:35.021 --> 00:38:38.607
Jeff. we only got seven minutes before
they take back the audio. Come on.

683
00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:40.818
Get back up here. dude.

684
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:42.903
We have to bring it. buddy.

685
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.366
-It's a good crowd. Dave. very good crowd.
-They're awesome.

686
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.952
-I got a big week coming up.
-What are you doing?

687
00:38:50.036 --> 00:38:53.331
I have an audition tomorrow
for Alec Baldwin's new sitcom.

688
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.498
What is it?

689
00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:56.292
Yeah. it's called "30 Glock."

690
00:38:58.627 --> 00:39:01.881
It's a cross between <i>Just Shoot Me!</i>
and <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

691
00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:02.840
Oh. my God.

692
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:05.760
-Is nothing sacred?
-Nothing.

693
00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.720
What about you?
What's going on with you?

694
00:39:07.803 --> 00:39:10.765
Well. you saw that movie about my career.
<i>A Quiet Place?</i>

695
00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.308
-Yeah.
-And. um...

696
00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:16.979
I don't know what to tell ya.
buddy. um...

697
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.689
We comics. we need each other.

698
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.941
-And we need to laugh more than ever.
-[Attell] We do.

699
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:25.196
I wanna give a shout-out to my friend.
and Dave's favorite comic of all time.

700
00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:27.406
Gilbert Gottfried
who passed away recently.

701
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.908
One of the greats.

702
00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.495
He was a great guy.

703
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:37.750
I was with him the night
before he passed away.

704
00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:39.251
and then you went to see him.

705
00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:41.712
You might be the last person
that ever saw him alive.

706
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:44.799
Yes. I'll never forget holding
that pillow over his head.

707
00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:48.094
And-- I was trying
to make him comfortable.

708
00:39:49.678 --> 00:39:54.517
In honor of our friend Gilbert.
can we have a moment of screaming?

709
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.434
Yes.

710
00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:59.313
[audience screams]

711
00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:02.900
Thank you. I love you guys so much.

712
00:40:02.983 --> 00:40:06.779
-Can we bring Bill out for a second?
-[Attell] Yeah. let's bring Bill out.

713
00:40:06.862 --> 00:40:08.114
Here he comes.

714
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:10.449
-What's up. gentlemen?
-Captain of the ship.

715
00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:11.450
Hi. Bill.

716
00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:13.994
I don't like standing
in between the two of you guys.

717
00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:17.373
Feel like you're gonna say something.
make me hurt my feelings or something.

718
00:40:17.456 --> 00:40:19.375
Thanks for having us on your shitty show.

719
00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:20.292
It's awesome.

720
00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:24.088
Well. they said we want to get some
of the shittiest comics we could find.

721
00:40:24.171 --> 00:40:26.715
-and I said. "I can get you two for one."
-[Attell] Thank you.

722
00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:28.342
[all laugh]

723
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:30.052
Hey!

724
00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:32.138
[Attell] Good hit. Bill.

725
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:33.889
[Ross] That's good.

726
00:40:33.973 --> 00:40:36.350
Why are you wearing a children's bathrobe?

727
00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:39.186
Nice one. Bill.

728
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.356
I always wondered what
the Blue Man Group would look like

729
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.025
when they weren't wearing the makeup.
And it's--

730
00:40:48.028 --> 00:40:49.947
Oh. guilty as charged.

731
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.949
I like it.
I like it. Dave.

732
00:40:52.032 --> 00:40:54.160
Dave. I gotta tell you.
you're my favorite hoarder.

733
00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:55.536
[laughs] Thank you.

734
00:40:58.247 --> 00:41:01.709
Nice to see you wore your clean jacket
for this TV taping.

735
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:05.504
Bill. and I can never thank you
enough for letting me live in your car.

736
00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:06.839
I really...

737
00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:09.508
Dave's dressed for Wednesday and Thursday.

738
00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:10.551
Thank you.

739
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:15.639
You look like that guy they interview on
the news. "This guy was here to see it!"

740
00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:18.225
-Nice.
-"Can you tell us what happened. sir?"

741
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.685
You guys...

742
00:41:19.768 --> 00:41:22.521
-Bill Burr is such a great guyâ€¦
-Fuck you. Jeff.

743
00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:24.315
-A great comedian.
-Get off the stage.

744
00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:25.649
He is.
He's one of the best.

745
00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:29.153
This guy's so New England.
he's the color of clam chowder.

746
00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:30.863
[all laugh]

747
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:32.948
[Attell] Nice.

748
00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:35.201
-[Burr] Oh. that one hurt.
-[Attell] You got him.

749
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:36.368
You got him good.

750
00:41:37.244 --> 00:41:39.788
You look like you just got fished
out of a lake.

751
00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:43.876
Jeff looks like Bill if he made
way better choices.

752
00:41:46.545 --> 00:41:47.838
I'm good with that.

753
00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:50.257
-Yes.
-I look like Bill Burp.

754
00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:54.887
I have the best job because I get to work
with my favorite comedian.

755
00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.347
-Aw. thanks.
-Thank you. Dave.

756
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.848
Thank you for coming to LA.

757
00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:59.600
Thank you for having me
on the show.

758
00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.936
-Thank you guys for being awesome.
-Jeff Ross. Dave Attell.

759
00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:02.978
Bill Burr.

760
00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:05.314
-"Bumping Mics."
-Thank you. Bill.

761
00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:07.483
Leaving me hanging on the five.

762
00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:10.736
"Bumping Mics."
Jeff Ross. Dave Attell.

763
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.157
Two Jews without money.
You don't see that a lot.

764
00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:22.748
They really looked homeless. didn't they?

765
00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:26.168
This next guy coming to the stage.
he's one of my favorite comics.

766
00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:28.712
I started out with him a long time ago
back in New York.

767
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:29.922
when we both had hair.

768
00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:32.925
He's one of the best joke writers
I ever met. and a tremendous person.

769
00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:35.844
Please welcome Ian Edwards. everybody.
Come on!

770
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:38.806
[cheers and applause]

771
00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.268
What's up. everybody?

772
00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:44.728
How's everybody doing?

773
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.814
[audience cheering]

774
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:51.569
Shit. I'm the only Black guy on the show.
and I gotta follow two white guys.

775
00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:53.988
Everybody good?

776
00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.656
[audience cheering]

777
00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:56.907
All right. that's dope.

778
00:42:56.991 --> 00:43:00.327
All right. Jimmy earlier was talking
about Michael Jackson.

779
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:04.039
And I spent a lot of the pandemic
watching TV.

780
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:08.043
If you have seen
the Michael Jackson documentary on HBO

781
00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:10.754
and still listen to his music.

782
00:43:11.297 --> 00:43:13.799
you are a piece of shit.

783
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:17.720
Straight trash.

784
00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:23.350
Now. I on the other hand.
have not seen the documentary.

785
00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:32.401
So I can listen to his music guilt-free.
you know what I'm saying?

786
00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:35.946
Y'all fucked-up. I found a loophole.

787
00:43:37.656 --> 00:43:41.577
Michael Jackson for life. baby. Yeah.

788
00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:45.080
I even canceled my HBO subscription.

789
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.293
Just so I don't stumble across that shit
on accident.

790
00:43:51.378 --> 00:43:53.839
I'm sorry. y'all. I was raised
on Michael Jackson.

791
00:43:53.922 --> 00:43:56.508
and I heard he ruined
those kids' childhood.

792
00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.511
I ain't gonna watch that shit
and have him ruin mine.

793
00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:08.937
Also watched <i>Handmaid's Tale.</i>
Any <i>Handmaid's Tale </i>fans in the house?

794
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:10.356
[audience cheering]

795
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:11.774
All right. we got some.

796
00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:16.820
It's based on a book written in 1984.
and it's a fictional story.

797
00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:19.156
set in a dystopian future.

798
00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:22.743
where a totalitarian government
enslaves America.

799
00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:25.829
and then we have a hero.
her name is June Osborne.

800
00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:29.583
and she rescues her baby.
and then stays behind.

801
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.545
And then she rescues 78 other people.
and then stays behind.

802
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:38.342
Then she escapes. comes back.
and rescues 25 other people.

803
00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:43.138
And I was talking to the homie.
and I was like. "Wait a minute.

804
00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:45.641
This is the Harriet Tubman story."

805
00:44:50.896 --> 00:44:53.982
It's like the author
moved slavery to the future.

806
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.944
and made white women the heroes.

807
00:44:58.529 --> 00:44:59.988
Which is fucked-up.

808
00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.992
'Cause Black people.
we didn't want slavery.

809
00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:07.329
but now you can't steal it from us.

810
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:13.919
And then charge us money
to watch it on Hulu.

811
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:19.716
Now we gotta pay for this shit twice?

812
00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:26.557
And now you can't even make
the Harriet Tubman story.

813
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.477
'cause everybody's gonna be like.
"Hey. man. that's <i>Handmaid's Tale.</i>

814
00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:37.901
I can't believe these Black people
are culturally appropriating from us."

815
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.615
I'm glad the pandemic is over.

816
00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:47.369
You know. one thing I do miss
about the pandemic was the no traffic.

817
00:45:47.953 --> 00:45:51.081
Like. no traffic in LA was mwah!

818
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:52.040
Right?

819
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:58.714
Right? I used to get in my car during the
pandemic. and the homies would be like.

820
00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:01.216
"Where are you going?"
And I'd be like. "Nowhere.

821
00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:05.637
I just wanna see how long
it really takes to get there."

822
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.600
"Two minutes?

823
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:15.272
Why the fuck did this shit
used to take five days?"

824
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.400
But now traffic is back.

825
00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:21.278
Don't you all feel frustrated in traffic?

826
00:46:22.029 --> 00:46:26.074
Yeah? Am I the only person here that feels
like murdering someone in traffic?

827
00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.577
All right. cool.

828
00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.790
That makes me comfortable enough to admit
to y'all that regular traffic bugs me

829
00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:35.751
way more than sex trafficking.

830
00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:43.926
You feel me?

831
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.681
'Cause a sex trafficker's never made me
late for work.

832
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:55.187
They actually gotta be the best drivers
on the road.

833
00:46:55.938 --> 00:46:58.440
'Cause they can't afford to get
into an accident.

834
00:46:59.024 --> 00:47:00.275
Or pulled over.

835
00:47:02.236 --> 00:47:04.738
So whenever you're driving
and some dude is like.

836
00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:07.366
"Go ahead. cut in front of me.
you're good. you're good."

837
00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:10.118
That's a vicious
fucking animal right there.

838
00:47:13.288 --> 00:47:15.457
With two girls tied up in his trunk.

839
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.962
And whenever some dude cuts you off.

840
00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:21.255
gives you the finger.

841
00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:25.634
and then steps out of his truck
to fight you. that's a decent human being.

842
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.180
With nothin' to hide.

843
00:47:31.598 --> 00:47:34.142
Shake his hand.
He's grinding for his family.

844
00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:40.774
I feel really bad for women who are being
sex trafficked.

845
00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:42.776
and they're stuck in traffic.

846
00:47:47.781 --> 00:47:51.159
And I know it sounds cold-blooded.
but I'm a dude.

847
00:47:51.243 --> 00:47:53.745
I don't have to worry
about sex trafficking.

848
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:59.001
I don't have any daughters. and my sisters
are not in sex trafficking shape.

849
00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:05.757
I know it's fucked-up.

850
00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:10.929
All right. let me just ask one question
before I get outta here.

851
00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:14.725
Why do pregnant couples
have gender reveal parties

852
00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:18.228
when they don't know what gender
their kid is gonna claim?

853
00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:23.942
Right?

854
00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:32.242
Why don't they just wait a few birthdays.
and then let the kid tell them?

855
00:48:33.368 --> 00:48:35.203
And then they can have the party.

856
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:37.789
What if you're wrong?

857
00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:42.586
You're gonna be wrong and burn down
half of California?

858
00:48:46.882 --> 00:48:50.052
Then you have this video of this party
that you threw for your kid

859
00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:51.762
that you can never show your kid.

860
00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:55.599
Then you got to tell everybody
who was at the party.

861
00:48:55.682 --> 00:48:59.144
"Don't ever tell my child
about that fucking party."

862
00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:03.607
And you know
the kid's gonna find the video.

863
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.068
And one day. he's like.
"Hey. y'all. get in here.

864
00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.569
What the fuck is this?

865
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.322
That smoke ain't me.

866
00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:18.914
Can't believe you spent all this money
on this party.

867
00:49:18.997 --> 00:49:21.792
and I need that money
for my operation...

868
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.173
so I can be who I really wanna be."

869
00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:33.387
All I'm saying is.
if you're a dad.

870
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.472
and you always wanted a son.

871
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:39.017
and the smoke is pink. don't give up."

872
00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:44.481
My name is Ian Edwards.
Good night. y'all. Peace.

873
00:49:44.564 --> 00:49:47.776
[cheers and applause]

874
00:49:48.735 --> 00:49:51.279
Ian Edwards!

875
00:49:53.281 --> 00:49:57.452
This next guy coming to the stage is one
of my great friends that I've had in life.

876
00:49:57.536 --> 00:50:00.706
Forget about as a stand-up comedian.
he's an absolutely amazing friend

877
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:02.958
and stand-up comedian.
I love him to death.

878
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:05.919
Please welcome the one and only
Joe Bartnick. everybody.

879
00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:08.004
Come on. Joe Bartnick!

880
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:09.965
[cheers and applause]

881
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:18.181
What is up. Los Angeles?

882
00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:21.101
[cheers and applause]

883
00:50:21.643 --> 00:50:23.687
I'm in a good mood. I'm feeling good.

884
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.731
I recently lost 80 pounds.

885
00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:27.190
[audience cheers]

886
00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:32.028
I know what you're thinking.
"He still kinda looks like shit."

887
00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:36.241
I know. that's why
I'm wearing a collared shirt.

888
00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:38.452
you got man-titties.
you gotta wear a collar.

889
00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:43.415
Takes 15 right off the top.

890
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.462
That's why golfers wear 'em.
it makes 'em almost look athletic.

891
00:50:50.672 --> 00:50:52.549
Like. I can't wear a wifebeater.

892
00:50:52.632 --> 00:50:55.844
You can't wear a wifebeater.
if you look like a wife beater.

893
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.601
If you have a six pack.
wear a wifebeater.

894
00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:05.562
If you just drank a six pack.
keep your sleeves on.

895
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.901
I know a young girl like yourself.
you want abs.

896
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:12.110
I get it.

897
00:51:12.986 --> 00:51:16.656
But the older ladies who have lost
all their hopes and dreams.

898
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.285
they dig the dad bod.

899
00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:24.790
Yeah. ladies. this body says "fun."

900
00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:30.670
This body says.
"Everybody's getting appetizers."

901
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:36.885
Nobody has to split dessert
with this body.

902
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:41.097
This body's built for comfort.

903
00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:44.184
This body sleeps in on Saturdays.

904
00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:48.230
Nobody has to get up
and ride a bike with this body.

905
00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:53.401
Glad I lost the weight. though.
'cause now I can shop at Marshall's again.

906
00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:57.823
Yeah. 'cause now I can fit
in double-X clothing.

907
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.243
There's nothing left at Marshall's
with triple-X.

908
00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:04.371
It's all green or purple or fuchsia.

909
00:52:05.872 --> 00:52:07.332
I can't wear those colors.

910
00:52:07.415 --> 00:52:08.667
I'm not Black.

911
00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:15.757
Yeah. Black guys look good in anything.
Black guys look good bald.

912
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.760
Imagine me bald.

913
00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.890
Black guys look good in dreadlocks.

914
00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:26.935
A white guy has dreadlocks.
you're like. "Fucking asshole."

915
00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:31.815
Black guy has 'em. you're like.
"That guy's cool."

916
00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.609
I'm not even really white. I'm Italian.

917
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:38.363
Yeah. We weren't white until the '40s.

918
00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:43.410
Till Frank Sinatra and Joe DiMaggio.

919
00:52:44.452 --> 00:52:47.539
You have to be really good at something.
then they'll let you be white.

920
00:52:48.957 --> 00:52:51.042
Like Obama. they let him be white.

921
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:55.213
Prince. Prince was white.

922
00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:59.217
OJ was white for a while.
then he fucked it up.

923
00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:05.974
Will Smith is the whitest man alive.

924
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:12.522
He assaulted a Black dude
and they gave him an award.

925
00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:20.405
Tiger Woods is white again!

926
00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:23.867
How awesome is that?

927
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:26.620
I fucking love Tiger.
He's my man.

928
00:53:27.787 --> 00:53:30.707
Wearing the black pants and the red shirt
on Sunday.

929
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:34.419
I love Tiger so much I used to listen
to golf on the radio.

930
00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.798
People got upset
when he cheated on his wife.

931
00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.091
"How could he cheat on her?

932
00:53:40.175 --> 00:53:44.054
She's beautiful. she's gorgeous.
she's an 11."

933
00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:45.305
[whines]

934
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.185
That's exactly why he cheated on her.
Because she's beautiful and gorgeous.

935
00:53:50.268 --> 00:53:52.812
You know she just laid there in bed
and didn't move.

936
00:53:58.026 --> 00:53:59.569
She didn't have to.

937
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:01.821
She's beautiful.

938
00:54:03.114 --> 00:54:06.326
But Tiger's got a billion dollars.

939
00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:09.162
He wants someone to lick his ass.

940
00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:16.711
Like only someone who works
in an Applebee's can.

941
00:54:20.048 --> 00:54:22.968
I'm Joe Bartnick!
You guys have been fantastic.

942
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:25.303
[cheers and applause]

943
00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.223
Joe Bartnick. everybody.

944
00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:34.145
This next comedian. oh man.
she is unbelievable.

945
00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:37.273
This is one of the few comics.
there's a handful of 'em out there

946
00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:40.568
that if you're going on after 'em.
you're sitting in the back of the club.

947
00:54:40.652 --> 00:54:43.989
you gotta come up with a game plan.
'cause she fucking destroys.

948
00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:47.617
Absolutely hilarious. please welcome
Jessica Kirson. everybody.

949
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:48.535
Come on!

950
00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.495
Jessica Kirson!

951
00:54:50.578 --> 00:54:53.289
[cheers and applause]

952
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:56.126
Hey. how ya doin'?

953
00:54:57.168 --> 00:54:58.086
Great.

954
00:54:58.169 --> 00:55:00.422
I'm so miserable. ugh.

955
00:55:01.881 --> 00:55:05.176
Although I. you know.
I am a miserable person.

956
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.221
I... basically.
I can barely get out of bed.

957
00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.598
This is a lot.
for me to be here right now.

958
00:55:10.682 --> 00:55:12.892
I know some of you look really sad.

959
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:16.563
I don't care how this goes.
I have to be honest with you.

960
00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:19.149
Um. it doesn't matter anymore.

961
00:55:19.607 --> 00:55:22.652
Basically. during COVID.
I stopped chewing food.

962
00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:26.406
I just started fucking my face with it.

963
00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:29.075
I've never cut my wrists.

964
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:33.163
but I started cutting my mouth
on the inside with chips.

965
00:55:33.246 --> 00:55:36.791
I became a cutter
on the inside. just... [loud gag]

966
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:39.335
You know. just fucking my face.

967
00:55:40.128 --> 00:55:42.839
And I was like. "I'm gonna blow up again.

968
00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:45.675
I'm gonna blow up."
'Cause I used to be a house.

969
00:55:45.759 --> 00:55:49.137
If you Google me. Zillow will come up.
I was a fucking house.

970
00:55:49.804 --> 00:55:54.559
So. I was like. "I need to do something."
So I joined Weight Watchers.

971
00:55:54.642 --> 00:55:57.604
where you download the app.
and it counts the points.

972
00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.272
The problem is I lie on it.

973
00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:03.526
I lie on my own app.
and I'm the only one that sees it.

974
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.570
Do you know how sick that is?

975
00:56:05.653 --> 00:56:10.742
The other day. I had a pint of ice cream.
and I wrote down "one baby carrot."

976
00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:14.162
Like. that's insane.

977
00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:15.747
'Cause I was a fat kid.

978
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:17.665
Um. I was really fat.

979
00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:19.709
I actually went to fat camp.

980
00:56:20.126 --> 00:56:24.172
It was amazing. like.
fat camp was the best time of my life.

981
00:56:24.255 --> 00:56:26.382
My parents didn't send me. I wanted to go.

982
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:30.303
Every summer I was like.
"I want to go to fat camp!"

983
00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.347
'Cause that's how fat kids talk.

984
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:37.727
'cause we slam doughnuts.
and muffins and furniture in our throats.

985
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:41.773
like. "I want to go to fat camp!"

986
00:56:41.856 --> 00:56:44.776
I'm gonna keep doing it
till all of you laugh.

987
00:56:45.443 --> 00:56:47.487
I'll do it for the next five minutes.

988
00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:50.573
"I wanna go..." I just peed.

989
00:56:50.657 --> 00:56:54.369
Anyway. so. fat camp was fun.

990
00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:56.579
We all went on our own bus.

991
00:56:57.205 --> 00:57:01.042
We used to play a lot of fun games.

992
00:57:01.126 --> 00:57:03.253
like breathing. umâ€¦

993
00:57:04.212 --> 00:57:05.088
chafing.

994
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:07.132
try-to-hide-and-seek.

995
00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:10.218
Try-to-hide-and-seek was great.

996
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:12.679
I would say to my friend Jodi.
"I can see you

997
00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.806
behind the barn. you fat fuck.

998
00:57:15.306 --> 00:57:17.559
Find a mountain."
Anyway...

999
00:57:18.476 --> 00:57:21.521
I have four daughters from two baby mamas.

1000
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:24.899
I'm like a fucking rapper.
I call myself "Lil Jew."

1001
00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:28.570
I saw an old friend recently.

1002
00:57:28.653 --> 00:57:30.238
and she's like. "You have four daughters?

1003
00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:33.074
Were they planned?"
I think it's the dumbest question

1004
00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:36.244
that anyone's ever asked me
in my entire life.

1005
00:57:36.327 --> 00:57:38.830
if my children with women were planned.

1006
00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:41.583
I'm like.
"No. I wasn't wearing protection.

1007
00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.169
they were all a mistake.

1008
00:57:44.252 --> 00:57:47.547
and we're pro-life
so we kept them for Jesus.

1009
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.467
Jesus."

1010
00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:55.138
Let's get even darker with this.
because some of you look uptight.

1011
00:57:55.221 --> 00:57:57.974
like I feel like your assholes
are like this right now.

1012
00:57:58.057 --> 00:57:58.892
Yeah.

1013
00:57:59.434 --> 00:58:01.019
Yeah. this is gonna be fun.

1014
00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:05.899
Religious people. some of them say that
gay people try to make their kids gay.

1015
00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:09.235
That we. you know. we want them to be gay.

1016
00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:12.572
And I hate to admit that. at this show
right now with this taping.

1017
00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.073
but that is totally true.

1018
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:20.163
That is the only reason I agreed to have
children. was to create four big dykes.

1019
00:58:20.872 --> 00:58:25.335
I don't care if my kids are kind.
I don't care if they're loving.

1020
00:58:25.418 --> 00:58:26.753
I don't care if they

1021
00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:29.631
smell like feces.
I don't care if they're educated.

1022
00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:32.300
I just want them to be
fucking truck drivers.

1023
00:58:32.383 --> 00:58:34.719
That's all I care about.

1024
00:58:34.802 --> 00:58:38.139
So we are doing everything we can
to make that happen.

1025
00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:42.268
And by the way. I shouldn't be telling you
this. but we're out to get your kids too.

1026
00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.979
This goes out to all the straight people

1027
00:58:45.063 --> 00:58:47.273
in the audience.
everywhere around the world.

1028
00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:49.108
we have secret Facebook groups.

1029
00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.902
we have a ton of funding.

1030
00:58:50.985 --> 00:58:54.364
we have vans. we have candy.

1031
00:58:54.447 --> 00:58:59.202
we even have long nets. where we can grab
your children from off the lawn.

1032
00:58:59.285 --> 00:59:01.162
Look how dumb some of you are.
you're likeâ€¦

1033
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.127
So we have been doing everything we can

1034
00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:10.046
to make our children dykes.

1035
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:13.091
We've been taking them
to a lot of softball games.

1036
00:59:14.342 --> 00:59:18.888
All four of my daughters have crewcuts.
they have military haircuts.

1037
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:23.268
We've been blasting the Indigo Girls and
Melissa Etheridge into their ears.

1038
00:59:23.351 --> 00:59:26.980
24 hours a day. seven days a week.

1039
00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:30.108
They march everywhere with feminist signs.

1040
00:59:30.191 --> 00:59:33.152
and we named all four of them
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

1041
00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.696
so we're justâ€¦

1042
00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:39.492
Jessica. that joke
would've done a lot better

1043
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:42.078
if you didn't fuck it up. but it's okay.

1044
00:59:42.161 --> 00:59:44.622
You're really talented. you really are.

1045
00:59:44.706 --> 00:59:48.793
You work so hard. you know.
everything's gonna be okay.

1046
00:59:48.876 --> 00:59:52.589
You're almost done.
it's all gonna be okay.

1047
00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:56.009
And soon you'll be in your hotel room
and you can secretly eat.

1048
00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.470
You know. today you ate a bag of Tostitos

1049
00:59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.681
and told yourself
it was a serving of corn.

1050
01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:02.807
You're a liar.

1051
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:06.060
You lie to yourself on a daily basis.

1052
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:09.355
And the guy in the second row
is not your father.

1053
01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.985
Okay. some of you-- yeah.

1054
01:00:14.068 --> 01:00:19.115
It's all gonna be okay. it's all--
I love you so much. you just got that.

1055
01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:21.200
Because it was very creative
what I just did.

1056
01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.370
and it was improv.
but some people won't get it.

1057
01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.831
'cause they're not aware.
Do you understand?

1058
01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:28.625
They have no idea what I just did.

1059
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.419
They don't understand that I just
completely turned around

1060
01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:34.505
and had a conversation with themselves.
They think I'm mentally ill.

1061
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:39.302
Which I am. I'm heavily medicated and
I haven't felt my vagina in three years.

1062
01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:43.681
Okay. what the fuck did I just say?

1063
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:50.980
This is the thing. I have very bad
anxiety. and loud voices make me crazy.

1064
01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.857
and I was at a store the other day.

1065
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.026
and these two girls
were having a conversation.

1066
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:57.070
and I could not believe
what it sounded like.

1067
01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.364
this is literally what it sounded like:

1068
01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.199
[high-pitched] "Oh my God. Chelsea.
you're not gonna believe it.

1069
01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:03.201
but I was on Instagram
the other day and I posted the most

1070
01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:05.536
amazing video. because I went to
Sephora and had my makeup done.

1071
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.206
'and it was like unbelievable.
because it looked so good.

1072
01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:10.750
Nobody commented. nobody did anything.
I couldn't believe it

1073
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:13.169
because I looked so amazing. like.
everyone's upset about the war.

1074
01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:16.130
but the war isn't happening here.
so like. who cares about the war?

1075
01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:19.592
I don't care about the war... [gibberish]
I put the same video on TikTok...

1076
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.219
[gibberish]

1077
01:01:21.302 --> 01:01:23.054
The other girl was like. "Oh my God.

1078
01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:25.765
you should've called me or texted me.
I'm your best friend. like..."

1079
01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.100
[gibberish]

1080
01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:29.519
[normal voice]
So I killed them. I fucking killed them.

1081
01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.146
I know. I did.

1082
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.148
I killed them.

1083
01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.986
Because I don't think you realize this.
these girls aren't going anywhere.

1084
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:42.782
That's who's gonna be in our country.
they're staying. they're gonna have jobs.

1085
01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.743
Like. your kids are gonna go to school
and walk into math class...

1086
01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.954
[high-pitched] "Oh my God. girls.
welcome to math class!

1087
01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:52.208
This is gonna be so exciting. it's...
[gibberish] Algebra!

1088
01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.001
It's gonna be amazing!"

1089
01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:56.546
[normal voice] Like. you're gonna
go to a therapist that talks like that.

1090
01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.298
You're gonna walk in and be like.
"Hi. I'm just really anxious."

1091
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.842
[high-pitched]
"Oh my God! You're anxious?

1092
01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:03.761
That's so horrible. well.
I haven't been feeling well at all.

1093
01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:05.471
Like. I haven't been able to swallow.

1094
01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:08.766
I met the cutest guy the other day.
I swallowed his load. I was like...

1095
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.310
I swallowed his load.
and it's been really hard for me too."

1096
01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.020
[normal voice]
How do you fuck a girl like that?

1097
01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:15.148
I don't understand.
I've been fucking women for years.

1098
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.442
[high-pitched] "Oh my God. fuck me harder.
that feels so amazing.

1099
01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.360
fuck me harder..."
[gibberish]

1100
01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.237
"That feels so good. I'm gonna cum.

1101
01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.365
Oh my God. I'm gonna kill all your
ex-girlfriends. you better call me.

1102
01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:25.992
[deep voice] You better call me!"

1103
01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:29.328
[high-pitched gibberish]

1104
01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:32.248
"Tick tock. tick tock. tick tock..."

1105
01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:33.207
[gibberish]

1106
01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:35.793
"Oh my God. I'm gonna cum.
I'm gonna kill your mother.

1107
01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.920
[deep voice]
I'm gonna kill your mother. motherfucker!"

1108
01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:38.838
[high-pitched gibberish]

1109
01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.924
"Oh my God. I'm gonna kill someone.
oh my God. I'm cumming!"

1110
01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:46.053
You guys are amazing.
I'm Jessica Kirson. thank you so much.

1111
01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:49.432
Thank you. I love you.

All right. we got a band back here.
everybody. say hello to the band.

1117
01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.823
This is the Goddamn Comedy Jam Band.

1118
01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.200
[audience cheers]

1119
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:10.787
They do a great show. A lot
of comedians started off playing in bands.

1120
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.414
They still have that musical thing they
wanna get involved in.

1121
01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:16.292
so they created this band for guys
to come out and sing along to.

1122
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.711
The man that created it.
I will be introducing right now.

1123
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:23.299

hilarious comedian from Baltimore.

You're all young.

1130
01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:47.323
One. two. three. fourâ€¦

1131
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.746
No.

1132
01:03:55.748 --> 01:03:57.208
I know what you're wondering.

1133

â™ª <i>None of you know who the fuck I am </i>â™ª

1134

â™ª <i>Why is this guy</i>
<i>Such an egomaniac? </i>â™ª

1135
01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:14.058
â™ª <i>Because I don't have an act</i>

Fuck. dude.

1146
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.080
I mean. it was something.

1147
01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:40.001
So we didn't get a song clearance.
so we wrote our own.

1148
01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:42.795
but we need help
from all of you guys here.

1149
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:46.507
So you really have to sing this.
all right? It goes like this.

1150
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:49.969
â™ª <i>We're gonna titty-fuck your buttcheeks</i>

I was flying on an airplane.

1218
01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:01.368
I saw this video of him. I was like.
"This guy is funny.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:04.497
This guy has potential." And like.
a week later. he was on <i>The Daily Show.</i>

to inspire myself

1243
01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:11.480
when I was younger and first starting
to do comedy.

1244
01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.108
