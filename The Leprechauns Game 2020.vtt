00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:13.747
(anxious music)

4
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.598
- [Lucy] Stop.

5
00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:32.066
- [Belle] What?

6
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.734
- What do we do?

7
00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.536
- You have to keep going.

8
00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.505
We don't stop we outrun
that son of a bitch

9
00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:38.972
and we just keep going.

10
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.608
- What if he never stops coming?

11
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.675
What if we can't stop it?

12
00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.776
- We can do this. okay.

13
00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:45.879
Look at me.

14
00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.948
We just keep running
and we'll lose him.

15
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.386
- I'm not sure if I want to
run away from what we had.

16
00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:53.987
I don't wanna never
see my family again.

17
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.525
- But we had two
choices. money. a future.

18
00:00:57.525 --> 00:01:00.328
easy life or the same
shitty existence.

19
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.329
We chose money.

20
00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:03.831
I'm not giving up this gold.

21
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.867
- Are you sure about this?

22
00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.068
- [Belle] I couldn't
be more sure.

23
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:08.869
- Okay.

24
00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:13.374
- [Belle] Look. we can have
a happy life. all right?

25
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.008
We can have everything
we ever wanted.

26
00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.410
Fuck the past.

27
00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:18.146
He's just one obstacle.

28
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:19.547
- Fuck the others?

29
00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:20.714
- They just didn't
make it. okay.

30
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.883
I feel really shitty about that.

31
00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:24.652
But trust me. if it was
the other way round.

32
00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.853
they would do the same.

33
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:27.955
- Bell. but--

34
00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:28.922
- No. no. buts.

35
00:01:29.757 --> 00:01:30.924
- This is ours. Lucy.

36
00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.528
We've committed to this.

37
00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:36.364
Now you either get
out of the car now

38
00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:37.731
or you continue on with me.

39
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:40.568
You make a decision.

40
00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:42.069
You make it fast. Lucy.

41
00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.075
- Drive.

42
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.445
(engine turning over)

43
00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:52.280
- Bollock.

44
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.185
- What's going on?

45
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:58.286
- I don't know.
it's not starting.

46
00:01:58.286 --> 00:01:59.387
- Bell. drive!

47
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:01.289
- I can't.

48
00:02:01.322 --> 00:02:03.257
(evil laughing)

49
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:04.925
- [Lucy] What's going on?

50
00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.360
- Give me. me gold.

51
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.830
(tense music)

52
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:19.807
(air swishing)

53
00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.648
(Belle screaming)

54
00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.117
- [Lucy] Can't see. I can't see.

55
00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:31.719
- [Leprechaun] What's wrong?

56
00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:34.322
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

57
00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.962
(anxious music)

58
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:54.642
(Lucy screaming)

59
00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:57.077
(ax thudding)

60
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.359
(thunder crashing)

61
00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:32.613
(rain pattering)

62
00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.448
- [Belle] Where is he?

63
00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:46.960
(thunder rumbling)

64
00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:06.547
(coins jingling)

65
00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:10.150
(muffled thudding)

66
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.354
(coins jingling)

67
00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:15.989
(evil laughing)

68
00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:21.629
(coins jingling)

69
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.001
(upbeat music)

70
00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.110
- How long have you known?

71
00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.080
Misha?

72
00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:52.920
- A few weeks.

73
00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.689
- Well. I didn't know
when to tell you.

74
00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:57.024
when the time was right.

75
00:06:00.828 --> 00:06:02.996
- Why did you then wait
so long to tell me?

76
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.937
- It wasn't easy to come
to terms with myself.

77
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:15.576
We haven't even had money
to celebrate Christmas.

78
00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:17.044
You know. things have
been tight recently.

79
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.278
We've got no money. Karl.

80
00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:22.650
- I know.

81
00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:27.955
And now that we have a kid
coming into this picture.

82
00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:34.327
- Don't worry.

83
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.537
- What?

84
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.639
- Well. don't worry about
any of it. it's fine.

85
00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:48.208
- What are you saying?

86
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.044
(worrisome music)

87
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.482
- I can abort the kid.

88
00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:58.185
- No.

89
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.055
We got this. okay?

90
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:03.891
We're gonna be all right.

91
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:06.927
Like they say. when there's
a will. there's a way.

92
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:07.728
Okay?

93
00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.166
- Karl.

94
00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.505
- [DJ] After this new
chat by Frankie FC.

95
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.972
and this is called Macronica.

96
00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.240
(upbeat music)

97
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.611
(cellular phone ringing)

98
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.881
- Hey. Marshall.

99
00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:29.883
- [Marshall] What's
happening. Karl.

100
00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.519
You got a minute?

101
00:07:31.552 --> 00:07:33.253
- Sure. go for it.

102
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.489
- [Marshall] Look. I've
got another job coming.

103
00:07:35.523 --> 00:07:37.725
Not the type or
anything like that.

104
00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.760
It's a weird one. but
I've got a feeling.

105
00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.361
you're gonna like this one.

106
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:43.931
Gonna go meet him
later for the deal.

107
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:47.400
- Look. mate. I don't wanna
do anymore dodgy work.

108
00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:50.070
I'm done with this shit.
especially the last time.

109
00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:53.006
- [Marshall] Listen. you've
got my word. I promise you.

110
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.375
you're not gonna be in
anything like the last time.

111
00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.212
- Look mate. you can't keep
promises in this line of work.

112
00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:01.448
Christ. we almost
ended up arrested.

113
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.884
That was fucked up. man.

114
00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.054
- [Marshall] Listen
calm down. bro yeah.

115
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.557
Come with me to the meeting
and if you like it okay.

116
00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:11.892
if not I'll still respect you.

117
00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:13.761
You know. but I have a
feeling you're really gonna

118
00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:16.163
want in on this one.

119
00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:19.466
Plus all that extra
cash will help. huh?

120
00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:25.272
- Okay. where do you wanna meet?

121
00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:31.444
(sirens blaring)

122
00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.484
Marshall.

123
00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:38.886
- How's it going. mate?

124
00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.788
- Been better. fine.

125
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.856
- Good. what's about being
about the missus. good?

126
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:43.857
- Fine.

127
00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:44.792
- [Marshall] Good. good.

128
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.093
- So what is this job offer?

129
00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:47.595
- That I still don't know.

130
00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.963
We're gonna go and see him
about the details of it.

131
00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.632
I think it's an in and out job.

132
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:55.636
Pick one up give him the money.
cash. go grab. that's it.

133
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:56.804
- All right.

134
00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:58.238
- You're down. yeah?

135
00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.372
- Let's go.

136
00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:00.207
- You ready?

137
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:06.346
(door knocking)

138
00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:09.683
- Thanks for coming.

139
00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:10.684
John.

140
00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.185
Nice to meet you.

141
00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.154
You must be Marshall?

142
00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:14.988
- Good guess.

143
00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.991
- And your friend?

144
00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:21.328
- He's actually my
business partner. Karl.

145
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.295
- Business partner.

146
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:36.409
So I need someone who
can do a job for me.

147
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:39.613
A quick in and out. no hassle.

148
00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.883
- You've come to the
right people. my friend.

149
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:45.853
- That's very reassuring.

150
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.391
- So. what is this that
you want us to collect?

151
00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:56.363
- Well. you may think
I'm a bit crazy.

152
00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:58.799
but I'm a collector.

153
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.937
I collect proof of other beings.

154
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:06.840
- Other beings?

155
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:12.045
- I've always had a weird
fascination in knowing there

156
00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:16.083
is more life out there
than we truly comprehend.

157
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:22.890
You name it. I own it. nearly.

158
00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:26.193
- What. like Father
Christmas (chuckles)?

159
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.799
- Now you may think this
is some kind of a joke.

160
00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.669
but what we're dealing
with here. is far more

161
00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:38.872
than we can ever understand.

162
00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:41.208
(suspenseful music)

163
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:46.046
Over the years. I've
collected such trophies

164
00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:50.517
as Bigfoot's claw. a Yeti's fur.

165
00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:57.758
the sack that Krampus used
to collect his children.

166
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.961
(Marshall laughing)

167
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.563
- Sorry is this
some kind of sell?

168
00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.397
Sorry.

169
00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:08.635
- This is why I pay good money.

170
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.604
There is a risk.

171
00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:12.973
You won't believe me.

172
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.809
but if I pay you well.

173
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.313
that is the incentive
for you to go

174
00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:22.816
and collect what I desire.

175
00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:23.683
Right?

176
00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.519
- Yes. sir. everyone
has a price.

177
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:28.956
- Good.

178
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:34.294
- So what do you want this
time. Rapunzel's hair?

179
00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:36.997
(Marshall laughing)

180
00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:41.068
- I want the Leprechauns gold.

181
00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:44.972
- Right.

182
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.510
- At the end of the
rainbow is his gold.

183
00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:56.850
I want you to go and collect
it and bring it to me.

184
00:11:58.351 --> 00:11:59.987
- So you would like us to
find a little pot of gold.

185
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.488
that's at the end
of the rainbow.

186
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:02.322
- Yes.

187
00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:08.328
- So if it's that simple.
why did you need us to go?

188
00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:13.000
- Ah. now this is where
I need you and your men.

189
00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:19.873
If you go. there is a risk
that you may lose you're life.

190
00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:24.344
- Hold up. you want
me and my friends

191
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.313
and my team to lose our lives?

192
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.517
- These are dangerous beings.

193
00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:32.786
creatures that we
are dealing with.

194
00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:41.028
Acting upon impulse. they will
fight to keep what is theirs.

195
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.331
- How much we talking?

196
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.572
- I will give you 100.000 pounds

197
00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:54.574
for the sack of gold.

198
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.413
- And if we don't deliver?

199
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:02.249
- Nothing.

200
00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:07.287
- Wait. you're sending
us on a wild goose chase

201
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.289
and we might not
even get the money.

202
00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:12.425
We'd have to be reimbursed and
have something for our time.

203
00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:19.199
- I will pay you 1000
pounds each for your time.

204
00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:21.534
Fair?

205
00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:26.039
- A grant is a grant.

206
00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.611
- Its a deal.

207
00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.445
Shake it.

208
00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:45.225
(anxious music)

209
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.793
This guy is off his tits.

210
00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:49.729
- Bro. a grand is a grand.

211
00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.166
- So what are you thinking?

212
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.734
- What am I thinking?

213
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.803
I'm thinking we get this done.

214
00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:04.011
- Such a completely
wasted chase.

215
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:06.479
I mean. no leprechaun exists.

216
00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.681
- Listen. you know that
as well as I know that.

217
00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.683
let's just get this
grand and fuck off.

218
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.652
- Okay.

219
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.486
When?

220
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.856
- Well I'm hearing it's
a little risky one.

221
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.527
So I'm thinking we could
hire a couple of local lads.

222
00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:22.395
Split the payment.

223
00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:23.496
How does that sound?

224
00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:28.535
- Give 'em 500 and
we keep the rest.

225
00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:29.869
- And it sounds good to me.

226
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.471
There's my business partner.

227
00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.441
(glasses tickling)

228
00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:39.646
(suspenseful music)

229
00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.883
(Tammy coughing)

230
00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:51.724
- How are you feeling?

231
00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:54.962
- I'm better. thank you. honey.

232
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.333
- I'm gonna go out
for a bit. all right?

233
00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:01.368
- [Tammy] Where you're going?

234
00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.238
- I have an odd job. kind of
thing. that's needs seeing to.

235
00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:10.477
- Please. don't tell me
you're not going back

236
00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.045
to that line of work?

237
00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:12.845
Please?

238
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:15.715
Ruby?

239
00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:16.516
Look at me.

240
00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:20.553
- It's not like before.

241
00:15:21.721 --> 00:15:23.256
But I need the cash. all right?

242
00:15:25.392 --> 00:15:27.160
I need to sort
this situation out.

243
00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:30.930
- We can find ways.

244
00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:34.267
- No. I will find us a way.

245
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.337
You need professional help.

246
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.373
Help. I can't afford to get you

247
00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:42.242
in a better state
with your health.

248
00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:46.246
I got this. all right?

249
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:50.617
You trust me. don't you?

250
00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:54.687
- Always.

251
00:15:56.756 --> 00:16:00.527
- Then trust when I tell
you everything is all okay.

252
00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:17.910
(Tammy coughing)

253
00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:22.215
(birds singing)

254
00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:26.919
- We're a little
bit exposed here.

255
00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:29.756
- What are we doing
here. Marshall?

256
00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:31.324
- This better be good.

257
00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.926
- Look. we've been hired to
do a job. a quick in and out.

258
00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:35.895
- The woods.

259
00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.933
- Look. some fool has hired
me and Karl to find something.

260
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.935
If we find it. we
get a hundred grand.

261
00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.637
If not. we get one
K for our time.

262
00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:45.438
Sound fair?

263
00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:48.775
- This better be no
longer than an hour.

264
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:52.079
My going rate is usually one K.

265
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:54.081
- Fuck me. I'll
take one K an hour.

266
00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:56.449
- Look. it's not gonna
take long at all. yeah.

267
00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:58.985
- [Ruby] How can you be so sure?

268
00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:00.653
- [Tim] Fuck the
time. I want my 100 K.

269
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.089
What do we need to get?

270
00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:05.925
- See over there. my friends?

271
00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.494
You find the end
of that rainbow.

272
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.762
you'll find yourself
a sack of gold.

273
00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:11.998
If not. we get one
K for our time.

274
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.067
So let's go find some
gold. my friends.

275
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.936
- You've gotta be shitting me?

276
00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:19.172
Pot of gold at the
end of a rainbow.

277
00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:20.640
- [Marshall] Look. stranger
things have happened

278
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.309
to me in my life.

279
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.511
- Someone's actually
paying you for this?

280
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.147
- Listen. it's a trusted
payer. dealt with him before.

281
00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.849
so go find yourself
some gold. my friends.

282
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.287
- All right.
- Let's do it.

283
00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.889
(gentle music)

284
00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:13.092
(mysterious music)

285
00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:34.073
(birds singing)

286
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.316
- This is ridiculous.

287
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.685
- Yeah. granted.
it's weird as fuck.

288
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.488
But 100 K. do you
know what I mean?

289
00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:49.756
What can you do
with a hundred K?

290
00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:51.758
Kind of grand if we fuck up.

291
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.963
- I mean. I could get me a
new Louis Vuitton with that.

292
00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:58.931
- Yeah. you do love you Louis V.

293
00:19:58.965 --> 00:19:59.766
- [Nel] I do.

294
00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:11.478
(coins jingling)

295
00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:12.312
- Hey. guys!

296
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.047
Guys. over here.

297
00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:27.794
- Find yourself a
pot of gold yet?

298
00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:30.497
- This is crazy.

299
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.331
- It is.

300
00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.667
But as he said. stranger things.

301
00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:39.171
So how did you get
involved in this?

302
00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:42.208
I thought you were
out of it last time.

303
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.610
- I was out.

304
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.479
But something crept up.

305
00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:47.514
Now I need the money.

306
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:54.053
- With what happened last
time. it was a mistake.

307
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.723
It shouldn't have
ended up like that.

308
00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:58.024
I hope you know that. right?

309
00:21:01.694 --> 00:21:03.763
- It wouldn't make
it any different

310
00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:07.033
when you guys left
me behind. huh?

311
00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.469
- Still banging on
about job gone wrong?

312
00:21:09.536 --> 00:21:11.203
Wrong place. wrong
time. my friend.

313
00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:12.171
No more to say.

314
00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:13.239
- Oh. easy said than done.

315
00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:19.446
I could've ended up in prison
for 15 fucking years. mate.

316
00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.448
- Yeah well. you didn't.

317
00:21:21.514 --> 00:21:24.551
You're here and you're
fine. so let's move on. hey.

318
00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:27.954
- [Marshall] Hey. guys!

319
00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:30.122
Guys.
- Fuck up.

320
00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:37.397
(group cheering)

321
00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:39.065
- [Karl] Hey. what is it?

322
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.133
- [Marshall] I
can't believe this.

323
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.770
- [Mick] Shit. man.
we're rich. bitches!

324
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.972
- I literally can't
believe I'm saying this.

325
00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:48.074
- [Tim] That's not possible.

326
00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:49.075
- [Marshall] Turns
out you can find

327
00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:52.912
the end of a fucking rainbow.

328
00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:54.414
- [Ruby] What's
inside that pack?

329
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:57.083
- Who's ready to be filthy
fucking rich. people?

330
00:21:57.116 --> 00:21:59.118
Look. think of
what I'm thinking.

331
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.488
this is worth more than
his measly 100 grand.

332
00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:02.955
We're literally
sitting on hundreds

333
00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:04.924
of thousands of
pounds here. people.

334
00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:06.025
- You gonna keep it?

335
00:22:06.092 --> 00:22:07.827
- Am I fucking gonna keep it?

336
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:08.895
Finders keepers.

337
00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:10.430
- (laughs) You the man.

338
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.065
- Hey. wait. wait. wait. how
much is this worth really?

339
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.968
- It's about half a mill.

340
00:22:17.136 --> 00:22:18.771
Like that's a 100 K each.

341
00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:21.441
(Mick laughing)

342
00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:26.479
(upbeat music)

343
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.224
* It's being so long ago
since I held you in my arms *

344
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.295
* It's being so right. I
live through your charms *

345
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.131
- Here we go. ladies.

346
00:22:46.132 --> 00:22:46.866
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

347
00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:47.967
- There we go.

348
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.001
Chi-ching.

349
00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:51.337
This is petrol station's finest.

350
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.005
Picked it over on my way up.

351
00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:54.907
Phoebe loves it. anyway.

352
00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:55.808
- How is Phoebe?

353
00:22:55.842 --> 00:22:57.043
- Oh. she's all right.

354
00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.244
She don't know about
the money yet though.

355
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.512
- Oh. a surprise.

356
00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:00.547
- It's gonna be a

357
00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:01.881
- A toast.

358
00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:02.749
To us.

359
00:23:03.816 --> 00:23:04.984
- [Al] To us.

360
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:06.152

361
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:07.353
- Yeah. baby.

362
00:23:07.353 --> 00:23:10.557

portion and live well.

363
00:23:10.657 --> 00:23:12.525
Live like fucking

364
00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:17.730
Another?

365
00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:24.471
- Are you sure about this?

366
00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:25.705
- What'd you mean am I sure?

367
00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:27.106
This is my first
glass of the night.

368
00:23:28.775 --> 00:23:30.777
- That's not what
I'm talking about.

369
00:23:30.843 --> 00:23:32.845
I mean. what if he...

370
00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:38.485
I don't know. what if
he's looking for it?

371
00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:40.520
And comes after us.

372
00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:42.254
- Comes after us?

373
00:23:42.288 --> 00:23:43.890
Well. I suggest
you start spending.

374
00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:46.358
Spend. spend. spend. buddy.

375
00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:50.329
Book a flight. take a holiday.
put a deposit on a house.

376
00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:52.198
That's what I'm gonna do.

377
00:23:52.231 --> 00:23:54.000
- You're not intimidated by him?

378
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.936
- This guy asked us to
help a leprechaun's gold.

379
00:23:56.969 --> 00:23:57.770
don't panic.

380
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:04.443
- Babe. I'm home.

381
00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:07.847
Sweetie?

382
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.551
You in bed?

383
00:24:40.547 --> 00:24:41.748
- [Answering Machine] I'm sorry.

384
00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:43.816
but the person you've
called is not available.

385
00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:45.785
Please leave your
message after the tone.

386
00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:46.719
(cellular phone beeping)

387
00:24:46.753 --> 00:24:47.920
- Hey. sweetie.

(muffled giggling)

393
00:25:17.283 --> 00:25:18.651
Is someone there?

394
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:21.320
Babe?

395
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:44.877
- Wha. got ya!
(Mick groaning)

396
00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:46.012
- Oh. shit.

397
00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:47.346
You scared the life out of me.

398
00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:48.514
- [Phoebe] I had to.

399
00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:50.149
'Cause what you did
to me last time.

400
00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:51.718
- Yeah. but you're a bad girl.

401
00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:54.320
I have...

402
00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:57.790
I've got some good news for you.

403
00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:00.893
Really good news.

404
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.730
I've come into a
little bit of money.

405
00:26:03.763 --> 00:26:05.164
- You promised me you
wouldn't fuck about

406
00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:06.432
with those guys again.

407
00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:08.567
- Babe. nah-nah.

408
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:09.602
It's nothing like that. babe.

409
00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:11.370
It's nothing like that at all.

410
00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.573
I just might to have happened
to have won the lottery.

411
00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:19.545
- (laughs) Say that again.

412
00:26:19.612 --> 00:26:20.479
What?

413
00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:22.414
- Maybe won the lottery.

414
00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:23.883
- How much?

415
00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:24.984
- Just 100 K.

416
00:26:26.152 --> 00:26:27.553
- What?

417
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.388
No ways?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:31.658
Serious. 100 K.
- No way.

419
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.033
(couple giggling)

420
00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:48.507
- [Mick] What does it feel like.

421
00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:49.776
Feels good to be rich?

422
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:50.710
- [Phoebe] Huh-uh.

423
00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:52.544
So what you gonna buy me?

424
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.881
- [Mick] Well. I'm paying
you in kind. you know that.

425
00:26:54.881 --> 00:26:56.048
- [Phoebe] Go away.

426
00:26:56.082 --> 00:26:57.249
(couple laughing)

427
00:26:57.283 --> 00:26:58.284
- [Mick] I'm joking.

428
00:27:02.088 --> 00:27:02.889
Oh. baby.

429
00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.957
- [Phoebe] Ow.

430
00:27:05.024 --> 00:27:06.358
- [Mick] Oh. watch
your head there. love.

431
00:27:06.392 --> 00:27:09.195
(couple laughing)

432
00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:13.766
You know. I'm gonna go
grab a shower. babe.

433
00:27:13.766 --> 00:27:15.935
- All right.
- It's being a long day and...

434
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.871
- [Phoebe] Don't
be too long. yeah?

435
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:20.206
- Yeah. you just thinking about

436
00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:21.874
how you're gonna spend my money.

437
00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.710
- [Phoebe] Yeah. I gotta figure
out how to spend that cash.

438
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.077
(couple laughing)

439
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:28.614
- [Mick] I'm sure
you'll have a long list.

440
00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.283
- Hot.

441
00:27:31.283 --> 00:27:34.086
(water splashing)

442
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:38.791
(muffled giggling)

443
00:27:49.802 --> 00:27:52.805
(suspenseful music)

444
00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:19.866
(Phoebe screaming)

445
00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:21.033
- Where is it?

446
00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.602
- Where is what?

447
00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:24.403
- Me gold.

448
00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:33.679
(dramatic music)

449
00:28:33.813 --> 00:28:36.615
(Phoebe coughing)

450
00:28:41.988 --> 00:28:44.957
(water splashing)

451
00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:48.127
(anxious music)

452
00:28:48.127 --> 00:28:48.928
- Babe?

453
00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:52.331
You all right. babe?

454
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.719
(dramatic music)

455
00:29:17.123 --> 00:29:18.557
- Run!

456
00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:21.360
(Phoebe coughing)

457
00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:24.831
(Mick groaning)

458
00:29:24.897 --> 00:29:27.867
(suspenseful music)

459
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:46.785
- Who are you?

460
00:29:48.254 --> 00:29:49.889
- What do you think I am?

461
00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:52.124
(Mick groaning)

462
00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:52.925
Thief.

463
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.495
You all just thief's.

464
00:29:56.495 --> 00:29:58.530
You can talk to her soon.

465
00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:02.969
(Mick gasping)

466
00:30:03.002 --> 00:30:05.704
(mystical music)

467
00:30:08.007 --> 00:30:11.077
What do you think
happens to thief's?

468
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:33.165
(evil laughing)

469
00:30:33.232 --> 00:30:35.767
(gentle music)

470
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:40.106
- Oh my god.

471
00:30:41.807 --> 00:30:43.075
What's all this?

472
00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:46.845
Come on. tell me.

473
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.548
- I. um...

474
00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:53.752
Shit. how do I say this?

475
00:30:56.322 --> 00:30:57.289
We're gonna be fine.

476
00:30:59.025 --> 00:30:59.791
- Huh?

477
00:31:01.027 --> 00:31:04.430
- Me. you and the little one.

478
00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:06.732
- Did you get a job?

479
00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:09.335
- Yeah.

480
00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:10.536
I got a job today.

481
00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:13.172
I got paid very handsomely.

482
00:31:15.241 --> 00:31:16.842
- You've got to be kidding me?

483
00:31:17.977 --> 00:31:18.744
- What?

484
00:31:20.346 --> 00:31:21.680
- No. you promised.

485
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.515
You promised that
after the last time.

486
00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:27.954
Please tell me that I'm wrong?

487
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.024
- It's a lot of money.

488
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.129
- And what did you have
to do for this money?

489
00:31:37.163 --> 00:31:38.397
- You'll never believe me.

490
00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:41.000
- Try me.

491
00:31:46.305 --> 00:31:48.007
- [Ruby] Tammy?

492
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.241
- Ruby.

493
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.044
I thought you coming
back home late?

494
00:31:52.078 --> 00:31:53.879
I haven't got any
food sorted yet.

495
00:31:54.013 --> 00:31:55.147
Let me put the oven on.
- No.

496
00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:56.949
No cooking tonight.

497
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:58.317
We're gonna celebrate.

498
00:32:00.486 --> 00:32:01.253
The job.

499
00:32:01.287 --> 00:32:02.088
Did me well.

500
00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:04.490
We are gonna be fine.

501
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:06.692
- How much?

502
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.329
- All you need to know is.
your medication is sorted.

503
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.466
And for tonight. at
least. you're not cooking.

504
00:32:16.402 --> 00:32:17.403
We are going out.

505
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.073
Finest place you can think of.

506
00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:23.409
Steak?

507
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:25.711
You want it?

508
00:32:25.711 --> 00:32:26.512
You got it.

509
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:31.450
- Please tell me wherever
you got this money from

510
00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:33.885
that it won't come
back to haunt you.

511
00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:34.686
- No.

512
00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:37.389
This is clean money.

513
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:38.657
All right?

514
00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:39.425
No issues.

515
00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:43.895
It's over.

516
00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:48.034
Living this way.

517
00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:54.240
It's over.

518
00:32:58.744 --> 00:32:59.545
I told you.

519
00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:02.048
I told you. didn't I?

520
00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:05.751
(women chuckling)

521
00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:11.723
- So we have 100 K?

522
00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:15.994
- We have a 100 K.

523
00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:19.731
- And you're definitely
not shaming me.

524
00:33:21.167 --> 00:33:23.935
- Well. if we can manage to
sell it. it could be worth more.

525
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.305
- Oh. christ.

526
00:33:27.806 --> 00:33:28.607
Oh my god.

527
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.812
Everything's gonna be okay.

528
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:34.646
- It is.

529
00:33:36.915 --> 00:33:38.550
- Right. I love you.

530
00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:40.319
Well. lets do that
ever again. all right?

531
00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:44.890
- I love you too.

532
00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:54.433
(cat purring)

533
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:11.117
(cellular phone buzzing)

534
00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:23.129
(cat purring)

535
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:26.332
So what are we gonna
do about this gold?

536
00:34:26.332 --> 00:34:27.633
- What are we gonna do?

537
00:34:27.633 --> 00:34:29.401
I've got one of my
divas come around.

538
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:31.203
hopefully we're gonna
sell our share of the gold

539
00:34:31.203 --> 00:34:32.704
and then get rich.

540
00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.806
That's what's gonna happen.

541
00:34:34.873 --> 00:34:37.676
- What about the guy
who originally hired
us to do the job?

542
00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:40.546
I mean. what are these
gonna go look for it.

543
00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:42.314
- Well. they shouldn't have
hired us for the job then.

544
00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:43.849
he should've done it himself.

545
00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:46.385
(men laughing)

546
00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:50.522
(door knocking)

547
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.933
- Got something for me?

548
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.670
(coins jingling)

549
00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.443
Right.

550
00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:13.078
Well. it sure is real gold.

551
00:35:15.514 --> 00:35:16.315
- Great.

552
00:35:16.348 --> 00:35:17.249
So--

553
00:35:17.283 --> 00:35:19.518
- So what do you want for it?

554
00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:23.989
What price?

555
00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:26.725
- Kind of like...

556
00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:33.832
- All right. we can take
a 100 K for this portion.

557
00:35:33.932 --> 00:35:37.436
If you want more. we can
get you in touch with others

558
00:35:37.436 --> 00:35:39.238
who can give you the rest.

559
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:41.873
- (laughs) You're joking. right?

560
00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.074
A hundred K?

561
00:35:43.108 --> 00:35:44.610
For gold that doesn't
even have a certificate.

562
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:47.879
And I don't have an inkling
of where it's come from.

563
00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:50.081
Let's say. the
police track me down.

564
00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:52.050
Let's say you two
get in the shit.

565
00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:53.919
Then I'll get in the shit.

566
00:35:53.952 --> 00:35:56.322
This is dodgy gold.

567
00:35:56.388 --> 00:35:59.024
And for that. we're gonna
need a discounted price.

568
00:36:00.326 --> 00:36:02.561
- Stew. you know the
price of the gold.

569
00:36:02.561 --> 00:36:04.563
We know the price of the gold.

570
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.632
- 30 K.

571
00:36:06.632 --> 00:36:07.633
That's my offer.

572
00:36:16.842 --> 00:36:19.478
(anxious music)

573
00:36:36.828 --> 00:36:39.831
(suspenseful music)

574
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.711
(evil laughing)

575
00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:29.815
(evil laughing)

576
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.720
(evil laughing)

577
00:37:40.526 --> 00:37:43.161
(evil laughing)

578
00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:02.681
(evil laughing)

579
00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:15.160
- Nel?

580
00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:16.562
- I'm scared.

581
00:38:16.562 --> 00:38:17.963
- Are you all right?

582
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:22.834
- Marshall. I think something's
after us for what we did.

583
00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:26.037
- What's going on. Nel?

584
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:27.806
- I'm not joking
about. Marshall.

585
00:38:28.974 --> 00:38:30.809
- Nel. what's going on?

586
00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:38.083
(anxious music)

587
00:38:38.083 --> 00:38:38.917
Oh. my god.

588
00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:30.168
(knife whooshing)
(dramatic music)

589
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:42.280
(knife thumping)

590
00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:52.057
(knife thudding)

591
00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.296
(cellular phone humming)

592
00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:59.631
- Hello?

593
00:39:59.631 --> 00:40:01.467
- Ruby. get down to Karl's now.

594
00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:03.435
- What is it?

595
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.072
- No questions. I'll
spill when you get here.

596
00:40:07.072 --> 00:40:08.840
Just get the fuck
down here. yeah?

597
00:40:08.874 --> 00:40:09.841
Shit's hit the fan.

598
00:40:15.514 --> 00:40:18.517
(gentle organ music)

599
00:40:27.826 --> 00:40:30.195
- Thanks for meeting me here.

600
00:40:31.396 --> 00:40:32.731
- I haven't seen
you since school.

601
00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:36.668
- Two of your friends
have gone missing. Ruby.

602
00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:39.437
Nellona Fox and Mick Sybil.

603
00:40:40.906 --> 00:40:42.608
We're assuming foul play
due to the amount of blood

604
00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:44.476
found at the crime scenes.

605
00:40:44.576 --> 00:40:46.845
Both bodies must've
suffered an immense trauma.

606
00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:51.249
- I don't know what to say.

607
00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:56.588
- We have you on CCTV
a few days ago. Ruby.

608
00:40:57.756 --> 00:40:59.390
We have you. and
your friends meeting

609
00:40:59.491 --> 00:41:00.892
at the Dickings Wood Trail.

610
00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.295
Your all together and
within a matter of hours.

611
00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:05.363
two of them are gone.

612
00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:09.768
What were you doing down
that side of the woods?

613
00:41:12.437 --> 00:41:13.772
- We were having a reunion.

614
00:41:14.773 --> 00:41:15.707
Just catching up.

615
00:41:16.842 --> 00:41:18.844
- Just a year ago. Karl
was nearly arrested

616
00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:20.546
for a 10 year
sentence for robbery.

617
00:41:21.647 --> 00:41:23.248
We failed to find pure evidence.

618
00:41:23.281 --> 00:41:25.884
but you and your
friends were suspected

619
00:41:25.884 --> 00:41:27.886
to be involved in
this apparent robbery.

620
00:41:28.987 --> 00:41:29.888
Now. listen to me.

621
00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:33.692
If you are hiding
something or someone

622
00:41:33.692 --> 00:41:35.761
or you know more than
you want to tell me.

623
00:41:36.695 --> 00:41:38.764
I would advise speaking up now.

624
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:40.966
- I know nothing.

625
00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:45.336
I don't know what
happened to them.

626
00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:47.773
And if I knew. I would tell you.

627
00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:50.876
- I don't feel like you're
telling me the whole truth.

628
00:41:50.909 --> 00:41:52.110
I'm trying to help you.

629
00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:54.312
Police aren't trying
to get in the way.

630
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.682
be a pain. we are
trying to help.

631
00:41:58.316 --> 00:41:59.985
We solve crimes. you hear me?

632
00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:03.989
- I wish I could help
find where my friends are

633
00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:06.124
but I know nothing.

634
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:14.165
- Whatever you lot are
messed up in. be careful.

635
00:42:14.165 --> 00:42:16.367
What ever's going on.
you could be next.

636
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.772
If you remember anything.
just contact me.

637
00:42:21.607 --> 00:42:23.241
I'm just trying to help.

638
00:42:23.308 --> 00:42:24.175
That's all.

639
00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:22.333
(muffled giggling)

640
00:43:23.568 --> 00:43:26.772
- Ruby?

641
00:43:26.805 --> 00:43:29.808
(suspenseful music)

642
00:43:40.285 --> 00:43:42.087
(dramatic music)

643
00:43:42.087 --> 00:43:43.254
- Boo!

644
00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:45.123
(Tammy gasping)

645
00:43:45.123 --> 00:43:46.324
- What are you?

646
00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.527
- Where is it?

647
00:43:52.097 --> 00:43:52.864
- What?

648
00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.535
- Don't play games. mate.

649
00:43:59.771 --> 00:44:01.439
A double-spawn puppet.

650
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.911
Me gold.

651
00:44:07.112 --> 00:44:08.113
Where is it?

652
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:13.852
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

653
00:44:13.852 --> 00:44:16.487
(anxious music)

654
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:19.290
(Tammy groaning)

655
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:38.309
(Tammy yelling)

656
00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:47.152
(bones cracking)

657
00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:48.987
- Nobody likes a liar.

658
00:45:00.866 --> 00:45:01.666
Oh.

659
00:45:03.668 --> 00:45:05.837
Never lie to a leprechaun.

660
00:45:09.507 --> 00:45:10.842
- Welcome.

661
00:45:10.876 --> 00:45:11.877
Take a seat.

662
00:45:16.347 --> 00:45:18.116
- Thank you.

663
00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:21.152
I really appreciate
you squeezing me in
at the last minute.

664
00:45:23.121 --> 00:45:23.922
- No problem.

665
00:45:24.856 --> 00:45:26.057
Is there anything in particular

666
00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:27.625
that you'd like
to focus on today?

667
00:45:27.692 --> 00:45:28.493
- Well. yes.

668
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:31.529
- Go on.

669
00:45:34.165 --> 00:45:36.167
- I would like to ask
you about the job.

670
00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:40.205
- You're thinking of
a change in career?

671
00:45:40.205 --> 00:45:44.209
- No. about the job I
have taken on recently

672
00:45:44.242 --> 00:45:46.044
that I perhaps shouldn't have.

673
00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:51.116
I was desperate but now I'm
worried about the repercussions.

674
00:45:54.052 --> 00:45:56.855
- And you'd like me to
consult my spirit guide

675
00:45:56.888 --> 00:45:58.489
to see if anything
comes through?

676
00:45:58.523 --> 00:46:00.125
- Yes. please.

677
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.526
I'm really worried.

678
00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:03.161
- Okay. well. let's begin.

679
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:07.265
If you wouldn't mind
shuffling this deck.

680
00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:10.068
Only your energy channel
the right answers.

681
00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:35.360
First of all. I'm sensing
someone close to you.

682
00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:37.829
T.

683
00:46:40.265 --> 00:46:41.532
Tanya.

684
00:46:41.566 --> 00:46:42.400
- Tammy.

685
00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:44.035
Tammy. yes. Tammy.

686
00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:47.038
She has a weakened spirit light.

687
00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:50.375
May I ask. is she unwell?

688
00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:53.211
- Yes.

689
00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:55.446
That's the reason why I took
this job in the first place

690
00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:59.484
for us to make a better
life for both of us.

691
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.287
She's weak. frail.

692
00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.923
- You're struggling to cope?

693
00:47:06.524 --> 00:47:08.159
I can sense a shift in energy.

694
00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:11.963
- I'm constantly worried.

695
00:47:11.997 --> 00:47:14.465
I'm just trying to
provide for both of us.

696
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.868
- I see.

697
00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:18.569
My spirit guide senses an arc.

698
00:47:20.305 --> 00:47:23.108
A bright path made
of many colors.

699
00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:23.975
- Colors?

700
00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:26.611
- Yes.

701
00:47:26.644 --> 00:47:28.746
And at the end may not
lie what you're expecting.

702
00:47:30.315 --> 00:47:32.450
- You're not making much sense.

703
00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:34.119
- Black magic.

704
00:47:34.152 --> 00:47:35.520
- I'm sorry?

705
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.688
- You've been dabbling
in black magic.

706
00:47:37.722 --> 00:47:40.825
- No. that's not why I'm here.

707
00:47:40.825 --> 00:47:42.360
- You are in danger.

708
00:47:42.427 --> 00:47:44.629
You must protect yourself.

709
00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:45.530
- From who?

710
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:46.731
- From him.

711
00:47:46.764 --> 00:47:48.799
- From that guy.
that hired Marshall?

712
00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:50.068
- No.

713
00:47:50.168 --> 00:47:53.038
He's an evil entity
of the oldest kind.

714
00:47:53.038 --> 00:47:56.107
He spawns from the ancient
valleys of Ireland.

715
00:47:56.207 --> 00:47:57.175
- Who is this?

716
00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:00.811
- This is an entity.
not of human descent.

717
00:48:00.845 --> 00:48:02.480
- You can't be serious?

718
00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:04.682
- There is only one
way to stop him.

719
00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:05.850
- How?

720
00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:07.185
- The four leaf clover.

721
00:48:07.185 --> 00:48:09.454
- A four leaf clover?

722
00:48:09.487 --> 00:48:11.322
How is that going to help?

723
00:48:11.356 --> 00:48:13.959
- The magical properties of
the four leaves combined.

724
00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:17.996
faith. love. luck and hope
only these can overpower him.

725
00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.865
- Okay. I've had enough.

726
00:48:20.932 --> 00:48:22.968
I shouldn't have come here.

727
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:24.269
You're nothing but a frog.

728
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.872
- You must find the
four leaf clover

729
00:48:27.872 --> 00:48:28.839
to stop this evil spirit.

730
00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.475
You must end this.

731
00:48:30.575 --> 00:48:31.376
- Enough.

732
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.213
- It can be found outside
the house of faith.

733
00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:37.882
(anxious music)

734
00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:53.831
- What is going on?

735
00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.266
- I've got things to be doing.

736
00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:56.267
Money to be spending.

737
00:48:58.236 --> 00:48:59.037
- They're dead.

738
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:08.413
Mick and Nel. both murdered.

739
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:11.816
No bodies. but excessive
blood at the crime scenes.

740
00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:14.885
- Wait. if there's no bodies.
then it could be anything.

741
00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:16.354
- Listen.

742
00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:18.356
My mate. Paul. who's just
joined the police force said

743
00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:20.925
that they're treating
this as a murder.

744
00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:22.393
Excessive blood.

745
00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:24.095
They had to treat
it as a murder.

746
00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:26.864
- You don't think...

747
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:28.866
John?

748
00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:33.071
- Who else d'you think?

749
00:49:33.104 --> 00:49:34.305
Of course it's John.

750
00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:35.706
He's the one who
put us on this job

751
00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.808
and he's the one who
wants his gold back.

752
00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.045
- So what do we do about it?

753
00:49:41.279 --> 00:49:44.282
(suspenseful music)

754
00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:48.386
(gun clicking)

755
00:49:49.387 --> 00:49:50.988
- That's what we're gonna do.

756
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.323
- Fuck. where'd
you get that from?

757
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.193
- Listen. don't ask
me any questions.

758
00:49:55.226 --> 00:49:57.228
Don't worry about
where I got it from.

759
00:49:57.328 --> 00:50:00.398
worry about. I'm here to
protect you lot's arses.

760
00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:04.635
Listen. Nel phoned
me last night.

761
00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:05.803
Running from something.

762
00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:08.906
She was petrified.

763
00:50:10.441 --> 00:50:13.744
I think she was murdered.

764
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.814
For fuck sake man.

765
00:50:20.085 --> 00:50:23.254
Listen. all of us. we
just gotta stick together.

766
00:50:23.288 --> 00:50:24.855
Stay in twos.

767
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.291
No one's safe.

768
00:50:26.324 --> 00:50:28.326
Not one of us.

769
00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:31.129
As long as we're in this
thing together still.

770
00:50:31.162 --> 00:50:33.798
- And how do we deal with this?

771
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:35.633
- How do we deal with this?

772
00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:37.635
First things first. we've
got to get to the root

773
00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:39.137
of this issue. yeah.

774
00:50:39.204 --> 00:50:41.506
Me and you. we're
gonna go see John.

775
00:50:41.506 --> 00:50:45.176
You two. stay here. don't
leave each other's side.

776
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:46.411
No one's safe.

777
00:50:46.444 --> 00:50:48.613
Not as long as
we's got his gold.

778
00:50:48.646 --> 00:50:49.647
Serious.

779
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:08.399
Listen. Karl. when
we go in the house.

780
00:51:08.466 --> 00:51:10.135
don't show any signs of fear.

781
00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:13.838
no signs of nerves and
we're gonna be a-okay.

782
00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:15.039
- Got ya.

783
00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:16.641
You think we're gonna be okay?

784
00:51:16.674 --> 00:51:18.676
- Listen. like I said before.

785
00:51:18.676 --> 00:51:21.679
if you didn't show any signs
of nerves. no fear. we're good.

786
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.082
- You don't think he's
gonna do anything to us?

787
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:28.085
- (chuckles) Listen.
we're good. man.

788
00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.526
- She's pregnant.

789
00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:36.327
Misha.

790
00:51:37.562 --> 00:51:39.029
- Shit. are you serious?

791
00:51:40.265 --> 00:51:41.466
- Yeah.

792
00:51:41.566 --> 00:51:43.734
So that's why I'm
a bit more on edge.

793
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:44.569
More than usual.

794
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.671
We need that money.

795
00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:49.507
And I want her to be okay.

796
00:51:49.574 --> 00:51:52.377
I need to be okay
for her and the baby.

797
00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:56.214
I don't want her to
grow up without a dad.

798
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:58.916
'Cause I know what it's like.

799
00:51:58.916 --> 00:51:59.884
I had that before.

800
00:52:02.887 --> 00:52:04.555
- Listen. it's gonna be good.

801
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:05.523
You've got my word.

802
00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:10.127
So what you want
a boy or a girl?

803
00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:11.929
- A girl.

804
00:52:13.764 --> 00:52:15.866
I want her to take after Misha.

805
00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:18.135
Fuck. having another
one of me running round.

806
00:52:18.169 --> 00:52:19.570
- (laughs) Your funny.

807
00:52:21.439 --> 00:52:22.240
- Right. let's go.

808
00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:46.231
- So you found it then?

809
00:52:46.297 --> 00:52:49.667
- Listen. just stop what you're
doing and leave us alone.

810
00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:50.968
- Excuse me?

811
00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:53.170
- Listen. two of our
men are dead. yeah.

812
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.072
And we haven't got any
money to show for it.

813
00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:55.906
What's happening?

814
00:52:57.007 --> 00:53:00.211
(John laughing)

815
00:53:00.245 --> 00:53:01.011
- He's laughing.

816
00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:03.214
Is this a fucking joke?

817
00:53:03.281 --> 00:53:05.283
- You stupid fuckers.

818
00:53:05.283 --> 00:53:08.519
You've really gone and fucked
it up this time. haven't you?

819
00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:09.387
- Fucked what?

820
00:53:10.655 --> 00:53:13.624
- It's not me that's
taking your men down.

821
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:16.994
That's where you've got
this twisted. you hear?

822
00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:17.928
- Who is it then?

823
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.931
- The leprechaun.

824
00:53:20.965 --> 00:53:22.967
You took his gold.

825
00:53:22.967 --> 00:53:24.935
- Just stop fucking
with us. all right.

826
00:53:24.969 --> 00:53:26.437
- I'm not.

827
00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:30.975
And deep down. I think.
you know. I'm not.

828
00:53:35.813 --> 00:53:37.815
- Can't believe they're gone.

829
00:53:40.685 --> 00:53:42.320
- Think we could
split their cash?

830
00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:50.628
What?

831
00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:54.732
- Really?

832
00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:57.968
Oh. my god.

833
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.572
I'm going to the bathroom.

834
00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:11.081
(muffled giggling)

835
00:54:14.719 --> 00:54:17.054
(suspenseful music)

836
00:54:17.121 --> 00:54:19.990
(muffled giggling)

837
00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:59.597
(birds singing)

838
00:55:09.607 --> 00:55:12.242
(anxious music)

839
00:56:04.695 --> 00:56:07.932
(keys clicking)

840
00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:10.768
- Oh. hey. Crypto's. it's
me. the daddy of doom.

841
00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:14.905
Thanks for joining me again
for this week's new entry.

842
00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:18.008
The leprechaun. true or false?

843
00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:20.478
The leprechaun has been
believed in for centuries.

844
00:56:20.478 --> 00:56:22.613
dating back to the 1800s.

845
00:56:22.647 --> 00:56:25.115
The leprechaun is said
to be an escaped demon

846
00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:27.918
who escaped from the
wrath of Leviathan.

847
00:56:27.952 --> 00:56:30.955
Leviathan is one of the seven
devils of the underworld.

848
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:32.857
He is said to have
collected creatures

849
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.792
and made them work
in the dark depths

850
00:56:34.792 --> 00:56:37.127
of the underworld for centuries.

851
00:56:37.161 --> 00:56:39.797
(birds singing)

852
00:57:14.832 --> 00:57:17.835
(suspenseful music)

853
00:57:51.435 --> 00:57:54.772
(muffled evil laughing)

854
00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:33.811
(anxious music)

855
00:59:19.724 --> 00:59:22.727
(suspenseful music)

856
01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.681
(knife thudding)
(dramatic music)

857
01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:19.283
(keys ticking)

858
01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.090
- Leviathan is one of the
seven devils of the underworld.

859
01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.925
He has said to have
collected creatures

860
01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:29.426
and made them work
in the dark depths

861
01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:31.729
of the underworld for centuries.

862
01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:34.765
It all goes back to the 1800s.
when a leprechaun was sent

863
01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:37.868
to earth to retrieve an
escape soul by Leviathan.

864
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.070
The leprechaun was there
to retrieve the soul

865
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.573
however. this is where
it took a very dark turn.

866
01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:46.243
the leprechaun got a
taste of the outside world

867
01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.712
and when he returned
with the soul.

868
01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.880
he told Leviathan that
he had paid his dues

869
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.949
and was ready to live
in the mortal world.

870
01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:55.119
However Leviathan
was not having it.

871
01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:58.723
And he said that the leprechaun
could not walk the earth

872
01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.158
and must live in the deep
darks of the cave below.

873
01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:06.430
- Please.

874
01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.732
Please don't do this.

875
01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:09.333
- Give me the gold. now!

876
01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:11.168
- What the hell?

877
01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:12.737
This can't be happening.

878
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.304
- Give me. me gold.

879
01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.074
- I don't have it.

880
01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:20.077
- Where is it?

881
01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:21.145
- I spent it.

882
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.283
No.

883
01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:27.317
No. no. please. don't.

884
01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.787
(Tim yelling)

885
01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.591
(match flickering)

886
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:38.028
(anxious music)

887
01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:38.929
No. please!

888
01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:45.035
- Sick and tired of it.

889
01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.037
The leprechaun is said
to have stolen a bucket

890
01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:50.307
of Leviathan's riches and
fled to the mortal world

891
01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.010
going into hiding in
the hills of Ireland.

892
01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.345
This is why the leprechaun
is known to hide

893
01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:56.881
like a cockroach.

894
01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:59.716
He hides amongst the living.
never wanting to be seen.

895
01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.152
A great trickster.
a talented hider.

896
01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:04.955
blending into any background.

897
01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:08.325
However. although the
legend goes. he is friendly.

898
01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:10.795
but he can turn on
a human in the drop

899
01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:14.164
of a heartbeat if
his gold is stolen.

900
01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.166
He sees his gold is a victory.

901
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.602
a victory of escaping
from the underworld.

902
01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:20.971
And if a human were
to steal his gold.

903
01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:24.241
he can open up a
wrath of anger inside.

904
01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.811
Now the leprechaun.
he may be small.

905
01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:29.413
but he has a golden box. which
is why he was originally sent

906
01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.148
to the underworld to begin with.

907
01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.850
He was a soul collector.

908
01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:34.318
He collected the souls of those

909
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.353
who stole amongst the living.

910
01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.722
And he was sent to the
underworld for his crimes.

911
01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:40.925
Now. if you betray him. beware.

912
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:46.096
he is lurking.
waiting to collect.

913
01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.998
Maybe to collect you.

914
01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:51.735

922
01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.450
(suspenseful music)

923
01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:24.068
(anxious music)

924
01:03:24.068 --> 01:03:25.235
(flames crackling)

925
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.872
(Tim groaning)

926
01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:43.954
- What's going on?

927
01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:45.923
- Run.

928
01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:54.798
(women coughing)

929
01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:02.772
- It'll be for your turn.

930
01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.508
- What is that thing?

931
01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:09.479
(mysterious music)

932
01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:13.317
(Ruby screaming)

933
01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:14.118
- Misha?

934
01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.322
- Karl. what was that thing?

935
01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:21.591
That creature. he tried to
attack us and it killed Tim.

936
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:22.826
- Misha. where are you?

937
01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:25.529
- Oh. I'm with Ruby.
but we're driving to you

938
01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:26.763
and the car broke down.

939
01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.666
And we're at Mount Tread Woods.

940
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:30.867
By the church.

941
01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.470
- Okay. wait there. I'm coming.

942
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.372
Fuck.

943
01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:36.806
He's right.

944
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.841
We've gotta go. now.

945
01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:44.048
(dramatic music)

946
01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:53.657
(ax thudding)
(Karl groaning)

947
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.360
(anxious music)

948
01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:06.636
- There's the thief.

949
01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.572
- Oh. shit.

950
01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.410
- An actual leprechaun.

951
01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.393
I can't fucking believe it.

952
01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.896
- You told them to take me gold.

953
01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:34.064
(mystical music)

954
01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:36.600
- I wanted a piece
of your history.

955
01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:45.709
(anxious music)

956
01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.448
- Give me back what's mine.

957
01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:56.886
(magical music)

958
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.689
Before you can
join your friends.

959
01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:15.305
Now. what am I doing here?

960
01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.843
(John groaning)

961
01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.257
- Hello?

962
01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.124
Anyone?

963
01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.793
- Ruby. what is going on?

964
01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.031
- We messed up badly.

965
01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:42.232
I'm so sorry. Misha.

966
01:06:42.266 --> 01:06:43.267
- No. I need specifics.

967
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.069
Tell me what is happening.

968
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:47.271
- We stole from a leprechaun.

969
01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.673
We stole the gold
from a leprechaun.

970
01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:53.009
Now it's taking our
souls. one by one

971
01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:54.311
until he gets it back.

972
01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:59.083
- And what do we
do to stop this?

973
01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:01.485
- A four leaf clover.

974
01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:05.555
We find one and we're
gonna finish this with it.

975
01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:10.794
Until now. I guess the church
is the best place to hide out.

976
01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.264
- Where we gonna
get one of those?

977
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.732
- Wait in here.

978
01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:16.866
And we'll see.

979
01:07:21.105 --> 01:07:24.441
- Please. please Father. look
after me and my unborn child.

980
01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.177
Please.

981
01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:30.214
(suspenseful music)

982
01:07:38.322 --> 01:07:39.723
- Ain't no god gonna help ya.

983
01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:44.161
(Misha screaming)

984
01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:48.398
(leprechaun chuckling)

985
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.522
- They grow in the
garden of faith.

986
01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:22.332
(anxious music)

987
01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:46.256
(Misha gasping)

988
01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:54.964
(mystical music)

989
01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.269
I found one.

990
01:09:01.905 --> 01:09:04.574
(anxious music)

991
01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.110
- No. no. no!

992
01:09:10.614 --> 01:09:11.415
No. no.

993
01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:12.749
No. please. no!

994
01:09:14.284 --> 01:09:15.084
Ruby!

995
01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:18.388
- Misha.

996
01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:21.825
- Ruby. Ruby. please help.

997
01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:25.595
Please. I can't get this open.

998
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.800
- [Ruby] I'm trying.

999
01:09:39.476 --> 01:09:41.878
- (sobs) Go!

1000
01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:54.258
- [Karl] We gotta find 'em.

1001
01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:01.465
(Ruby panting)

1002
01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.833
- Ruby. we can't keep running.

1003
01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:08.037
- We use this four
leaf clover to kill it.

1004
01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.607
- It will bite our hands off.

1005
01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:13.009
How exactly are
we gonna do that?

1006
01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.345
- We hold the fucker down
and force it down its--

1007
01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:16.513
(dramatic music)
(ax thudding)

1008
01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.014
(Ruby groaning)

1009
01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.684
(anxious music)

1010
01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:26.122
Go!

1011
01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.357
- [Misha] Ruby!

1012
01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:29.125
Ruby.

1013
01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:31.795
(foot thumping)

1014
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.365
- I'll be right behind you.

1015
01:10:52.316 --> 01:10:54.718
(ax thumping)

1016
01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.564
(mystical music)

1017
01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.504
- Another soul to keep.

1018
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.241
- [Marshall] Shit.

1019
01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.777
- Ready to pay back your sins?

1020
01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.245
And join the quad?

1021
01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.115
- Marshall!

1022
01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.884
- I can't see.

1023
01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.753
(mystical music)

1024
01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:32.556
(bones creaking)

1025
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:55.612
- Run. Misha!

1026
01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:58.247
(hand thumping)

1027
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.388
- Oh. where d'you get that from?

1028
01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:07.090
- You can have it. if you want.

1029
01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:10.727
- Oh. you're not all
mean and bastards. then.

1030
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.961
- [Karl] Misha!

1031
01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.800
(anxious music)

1032
01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:26.376
(leprechaun coughing)

1033
01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.815
- I put something special in.

1034
01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.451
It's got four leaves
and it's green.

1035
01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:36.953
(leprechaun coughing)

1036
01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:39.989
(leprechaun gasping)

1037
01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:43.159
- You did it.

1038
01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:43.960
- It's over.

1039
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:50.033
(mystical music)

1040
01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.374
- They're souls.

1041
01:12:58.442 --> 01:12:59.242
They're set free.

1042
01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:16.793
Any day now.

1043
01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:19.596
- Any day.

1044
01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:25.735
- You excited about
being in our new home?

1045
01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:28.905
- (laughs) of course.

1046
01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:32.709
- It was worth it.

1047
01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:34.644
That gold.

1048
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.280
- Yeah.

1049
01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:43.352
(Karl yawning)

1050
01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:46.790
- Sweetheart. I'm gonna go
have a sleep. all right?

1051
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.158
I'm gonna let you carry
on watching the film.

1052
01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.561
- You don't wanna watch
the end of the movie?

1053
01:13:51.595 --> 01:13:53.096
- I don't even understand it.

1054
01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:56.766
It's a scarecrow. there's
some sort of 48 hour thing.

1055
01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:57.834
I don't even...

1056
01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:01.004
I'm gonna go.

1057
01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:02.405
- All right.

1058
01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:03.573
- See you upstairs. all right?

1059
01:14:03.607 --> 01:14:04.407
- Okay.

1060
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.597
(water running)

1061
01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.874
(anxious music)

1062
01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:41.811
- Shucks. I'm back.

1063
01:14:42.746 --> 01:14:45.448
(mystical music)

1064
01:15:03.567 --> 01:15:06.169
(Misha gasping)

1065
01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:09.205
(suspenseful music)

1066
01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:15.011
(Misha groaning)

1067
01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:17.614
- Karl!

1068
01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:25.388
Karl!

1069
01:15:33.763 --> 01:15:34.564
Karl!

1070
01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:39.168
(stair chair whizzing)

1071
01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:57.053
- Go on then. give
us a smile then.

1072
01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:02.558
(Misha screaming)

1073
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.161
(upbeat music)

1074
01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:27.777
(bright music)

1075
01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.761
(anxious music)
