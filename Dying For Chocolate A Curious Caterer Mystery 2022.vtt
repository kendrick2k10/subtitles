5
00:00:58.767 --> 00:00:59.867
- Mom.
- Olive.

6
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.367
I really don't think
the kids are gonna like

7
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.533
gruyere biscuits.

8
00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.367
You're goin' on a field
trip to the mountains

9
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.467
and I promised Mr. Bowman
that I would provide

10
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700
an appropriate snack.

11
00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:12.633
I'm pretty sure
he meant trail mix.

12
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.367
Gruyere is an Alpine cheese.

13
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.033
And we're going
to the Rockies.

14
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.266
And Mr. Bowman's
not even coming.

15
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.633
He says he's needed at that.

16
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.700
Right. So am I.

17
00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.100
Okay. so I think
they're gonna love 'em.

18
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.233
Yes. and you're gonna
have the best time.

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.900
I love you.

20
00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:32.934
You're gonna have a great time.

21
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.800

- Bye.

That is the chocolate-covered
shortbread I have read about.

37
00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.333
Hi. Laura!

38
00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:17.867
Hi. honey.

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.934
Or do I need to call you
Dr. Smiley on school grounds.

40
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.767
Eh. call me excited
for your feast.

41
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.200
Oh. you're gonna be here!

42
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.266
Barring a student in need
of emergency counseling.

43
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.533
I will be here.

44
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:28.767
Aw.

45
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.000
Well. that makes me
very happy because

46
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.533
I would not have this
job if it weren't for you

47
00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:34.934
pitching me to Adele.

48
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.333
Oh. I'd love to
take the credit.

49
00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.500
but when I went to Adele
to sing your praises.

50
00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:40.767
they'd already been
sung quite well

51
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.000
by another faculty member.

52
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.367
Any guesses as to who?

53
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.667
Brad Bowman?

54
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.200
Gold star for Goldy.

55
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.000
Has he asked you out yet?

56
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.266
No.

57
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.867
He's Olive's teacher.

58
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.934
There is no policy against
faculty-parent relationships.

59
00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.934
Did you come in here
to make me go on a date?

60
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.500
No.

61
00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.000
Actually. I wanted to talk
to you about something

62
00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:04.233
that I've noticed.

63
00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:05.333
There's been-
- Goldy.

64
00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:07.900
Oh. hi. Laura.

65
00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:09.166
Hi. Brad.

66
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.667
It's funny. we were
just talking about-

67
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.500
When people were gonna arrive.

68
00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:14.500
Uh. well. that would be now.

69
00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.033
They're gathering out front.

70
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.600
Sending the menu in advance
was clearly a brilliant move.

71
00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:19.900
Yes. it was.

72
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.667
So. are we good
to open the doors?

73
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.667
Absolutely.

74
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.900
I'll handle it.

75
00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.400
Oh. I thought
you wanted to talk.

76
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:26.533
Later.

77
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.500
I was wondering-

78
00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.333
When I was gonna
finish these cookies?

79
00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.100
Well. the answer is now.

80
00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:37.600
Yeah.

81
00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:51.600
Hi. hi. um.

82
00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:52.667
Hi.

83
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.066
I'm sorry about that.

84
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.600
Oh. no worries.

85
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.500
I'm just gonna say it. okay?

86
00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:01.233
Okay.

87
00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:05.166
I haven't been on a
date since my divorce.

88
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.967
which technically means
I haven't been on a date

89
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.734
since before I was married.
- Right.

90
00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:10.800
And it's easy to say that
I just haven't had time

91
00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:13.400
between Olive and being
a chef at The Bistro

92
00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:14.467
and starting my own business.

93
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.266
but the truth is. um.

94
00:04:18.867 --> 00:04:21.467
I am terrified

95
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.400
to even think about it.

96
00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.400
I understand.

97
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.233
You are very understanding.

98
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:31.066
I'm a teacher.

99
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.166
So.

100
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.133
Friday night. The Bistro.

101
00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.967
I go on my first date

102
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.133
in 12 years.

103
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:44.166
Ah.

104
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.467
- With you.
- Okay.

105
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.633
If you're free.

106
00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:48.767
I am.

107
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.467
I'll meet you at 7:00.

108
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.900
Sounds good.

109
00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:55.967
There she is.

110
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.467
And there he is.

111
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.967
Hey. Adele. Archie.

112
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.166
Excuse me.
- Okay.

113
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.533
Goldy. confession.

114
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:05.867
Brad did have to twist
my arm to convince me

115
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.200
to use the booster club as the
beta test for your business.

116
00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:10.667
But look who's smiling now.

117
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.033
Oh. I certainly am.

118
00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:15.467
It's like I'm sitting at Cafe
du Mont in the French Quarter.

119
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.467
Yes. I had to stop
Archie from going back

120
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.300
for second beignets.

121
00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:21.700
Anyways. everything looks
absolutely gorgeous.

122
00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:24.467
It's like you've been
doing this for eons.

123
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.734
Thank you.

124
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.633
And thank you so much
for this opportunity.

125
00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:29.533
I really appreciate it.

126
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:30.700
And you know what?

127
00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:32.133
We have reserved
beignets in the kitchen.

128
00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:35.967
Oh. be still my heart.

129
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.066
All right. you.

130
00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:48.700
Marla!

131
00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:50.533
That is exactly what
these shortbreads said

132
00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:52.200
when I walked in.

133
00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.233
They went. "Marla!"

134
00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:57.633
They called my name and now
we're in love.

135
00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:01.166
Well. as long as the beignets
weren't talking to you.

136
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.533
Archie Dennison is already
in a committed relationship

137
00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:04.533
with them.

138
00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:06.133
Oh. I wonder if Adele knows.

139
00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.367
Maybe she'll catch him in
the act with the beignets.

140
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.800
Stop it!

141
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:11.533
She didn't catch anyone.

142
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.467
Oh. it's not the
story Adele tells.

143
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.533
I have told you. there
is nothing going on

144
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.934
between Archie and Laura.

145
00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.533
Yeah. you did tell me that.

146
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.367
just like you told me you and
Richard weren't splitting up.

147
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.934
Oh! Hey now!

148
00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:23.367
Going for the jugular.

149
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.367
No. not at all.

150
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.433
I'm going for the truth.

151
00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:27.433
He's here. by the way.

152
00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:29.200
- Who?
- Your ex.

153
00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:32.266
Yeah. he's cornered Brad Bowman.

154
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.867
Might wanna go save Brad.

155
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.266
Ugh.

156
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.133
There's not enough
shortbread in this room.

157
00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:40.200
Not only is it a
great investment.

158
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.367
but it's also great
for the community.

159
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.533
I know that means a lot to you.

160
00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.367
being a a fourth
generation Elk Parker.

161
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.934
Wow. how did you know that?

162
00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:50.967
Trust me. I do lots of
research on potential investors.

163
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.600
Well. I'm not sure I'm that-

164
00:06:52.734 --> 00:06:54.533
Brad. I am.

165
00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:56.533
You are what?

166
00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.033
Ah. Goldy. hello.

167
00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:00.667
Nicely done. by the way.

168
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.333
I should never have doubted you.

169
00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:03.500
Well. if you
hadn't doubted me.

170
00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:04.867
then I might not
have been so impelled

171
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.767
to prove you wrong.

172
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.967
You were what?

173
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.166
Confident that Mr.
Bowman here will invest

174
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.333
in a tremendous new
opportunity that will be

175
00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:14.533
a boon for the town.

176
00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:20.433
The Elk Park Wellness Center.

177
00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:21.700
What?

178
00:07:21.834 --> 00:07:22.934
Yeah.

179
00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:24.533
I mean. you're not the
only one that could

180
00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.033
start a new business.

181
00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:28.834
Forgive me. Dr. Korman.

182
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:30.000
I see a parent in distress.

183
00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:31.166
Brad. yeah. thank you.

184
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.700
I'll be in touch.

185
00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:40.533
Oh. come on.

186
00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:42.433
You don't have to worry
about your child support.

187
00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.266
I'm not. I'm not.

188
00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:47.600
But how much are you
putting into this thing?

189
00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:49.767
I'm a minority investor.

190
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.333
Come on. you and
Olive will be fine.

191
00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:52.867
I'm not worried about that.

192
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.433
Look. my new business
is just me doing

193
00:07:57.567 --> 00:07:59.867
what I've always done. cooking.

194
00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:02.767
Since when are you a
property developer?

195
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.934
I'm a doctor. and the
property happens to be

196
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.600
the wellness center.

197
00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:09.834
Well. if you're hitting
up school teachers

198
00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:11.567
for an investment. I
can tell you right now-

199
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.100
I'm hitting up school
teachers who happen to be

200
00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:15.734
worth over $5 million dollars.

201
00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:17.834
thank you to their
family's silver mine.

202
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.333
And I'm not the only investor.

203
00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:23.567
Who?

204
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.000
Well. um.

205
00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:27.433
Archie. for one.

206
00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:30.000
That doesn't make
me feel better.

207
00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:33.000
And the other one is
about to make his way over.

208
00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:34.834
- Owen Gentle?
- Dr. Gentle.

209
00:08:34.967 --> 00:08:36.900
I know he's a doctor.

210
00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.000
- Goldy.
- Hi.

211
00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:39.900
The meal is sublime.

212
00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:41.400
Oh.

213
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.400
I confess to inhaling my
poached salmon.

214
00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:45.834
Mmm. well. I must
confess that my supplier

215
00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:48.834
was short and it's
actually steelhead trout.

216
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:51.000
Hmm. and yet the
advanced menu said salmon.

217
00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:54.100
so my tongue tasted salmon.

218
00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.400
Power of suggestion
at work. eh. Richard?

219
00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:57.834
Absolutely.

220
00:08:57.967 --> 00:08:59.333
Power of suggestion?

221
00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:01.800
Oh. I. uh. use it all
the time in my hypnotherapy

222
00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:04.133
to treat serious addictions.

223
00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:05.400
Hmm.

224
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:06.967
Oh. and speaking of
treating addictions.

225
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.967
I was just telling
Goldy about our venture

226
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.000
and she was-
- Confused.

227
00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:16.233
But so happy that
you're a part of it.

228
00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:20.300
I'm happy. too.

229
00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:22.000
Well. I have to
get back to work.

230
00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:23.133
Great job.

231
00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:24.500
Thank you. Enjoy.

232
00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:29.333
Right?

233
00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:30.633
Oh!

234
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:31.800
There we go. Sorry.

235
00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:33.467
It's okay.

236
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.567
Okay. that's all right.

237
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.000
No. it's all good.

238
00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:38.467
Okay. no. it's fine.

239
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.467
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

240
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.400
I didn't bring the champagne!

241
00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:43.834
Hey. I got it. I
got it. I got it.

242
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.500
It's not a party until
someone breaks a glass.

243
00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:55.467
I'm sorry. but um. I
think we need to leave.

244
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.867
and would it be okay
if I brought you

245
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.900
your check tomorrow?

246
00:09:58.033 --> 00:09:59.000
Oh. of course. yeah.

247
00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:05.300
- You okay?
- Yeah. okay.

248
00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:08.066
Well. that was well handled.

249
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.967
Well. cleaning up that
glass is a lot easier

250
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.967
than fixing what's broken
in that relationship.

251
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.900
Can we still talk?

252
00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:17.400
Yeah. go for it.

253
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:18.500
Somewhere else.

254
00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:20.800
Okay. do you want
me to come meet you

255
00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:21.834
at your office when I'm done?

256
00:10:21.967 --> 00:10:23.633
I'm heading out.

257
00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:24.900
Counseling clinic?

258
00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:26.667
Would my house be okay?

259
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800
Yeah.

260
00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:28.900
You meet me there?

261
00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:30.000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

262
00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:31.500
I'll see you there.
- Okay.

263
00:10:50.767 --> 00:10:51.633
Excuse me.

264
00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:53.633
Can I help you?

265
00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:54.667
Julian.

266
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.000
Hey. Mr. Bowman.

267
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:57.300
Hey.

268
00:10:57.433 --> 00:10:58.900
Uh. your mom and Archie.
they left awhile ago.

269
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.567
Yeah. no. I'm actually
not here for them.

270
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.800
Okay.

271
00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:04.567
Well. can I help
you with something?

272
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.367
No. I'm just
waitin' on someone.

273
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.367
Okay.

274
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.867
Well. uh. it's good
to see you. Julian.

275
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.467
Yeah. you too. Mr. Bowman.

276
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.200
We've
got your usual Elk Park

277
00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:54.800
drive time traffic report.

278
00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:58.633
Now we are getting some
reports of an accident

279
00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:01.600
on Copper Canyon Road that
could really slow things

280
00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:05.600
down tonight. so please
drive accordingly.

281
00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.533
Call Laura Smiley.

282
00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:19.367
Hi. it's Laura.

283
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.700
You know what to do.

284
00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:22.100
Hey. it's me.

285
00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:23.233
Um.

286
00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:25.200
There's been an accident.

287
00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:26.600
I'm so sorry.

288
00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:29.266
I just. I don't know how
long this is gonna take.

289
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.567
but I guess I'll see
ya when I see ya.

290
00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:38.333
Hey. Mason!

291
00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:39.367
What's goin' on?

292
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.367
Hey. Goldy.

293
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.367
Hey.

294
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.567
Car ran off the cliff.

295
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.700
What?

296
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.600
Is it someone from Elk Park?

297
00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:48.934
Listen. before we
announce a death.

298
00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:51.033
we need to confirm
ID. notify the family.

299
00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:54.200
Vehicle
registered to one Laura Smiley.

300
00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:55.433
What?

301
00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.767
No. no. no. no. no. no.

302
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.033
Goldy. you can't go in there!

303
00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.500
Goldy. you can't go down there!

304
00:13:01.633 --> 00:13:03.000
Ma'am. ma'am.
get back. get back.

305
00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:04.867
There's already one
body down there.

306
00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:06.900
What?

307
00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:08.600
- Mason.
- She's dead?

308
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:11.166
Laura's dead?

309
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.667
Laura's her friend.

310
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.333
She heard the dispatcher
give the ID on my walkie.

311
00:13:14.467 --> 00:13:15.433
No. no. no. no.

312
00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:16.834
I was. I was just with her.

313
00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:18.500
Miss Barry. she's gone.

314
00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.000
Okay. there's
nothing you can do.

315
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.000
No.

316
00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.000
Mason's gonna
take care of you.

317
00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:23.133
I'll be by in a minute.

318
00:13:41.467 --> 00:13:43.333
Detective Shultz is
gonna talk to you now.

319
00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:47.600
He's. um. he can come on
kinda strong sometimes.

320
00:13:47.734 --> 00:13:51.834
but he's a great guy and.
you know. a real detective.

321
00:13:51.967 --> 00:13:53.500
I just mean he's
super experienced.

322
00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.000
He just transferred
from San Francisco

323
00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.066
and he's worked on major
cases and he's got this wavy-

324
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200
Mason.

325
00:14:00.633 --> 00:14:01.867
He's right behind
me. isn't he?

326
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.266
Yup.

327
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.900
Detective. I was just
explaining that you've

328
00:14:08.033 --> 00:14:08.900
worked on a lot of-

329
00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:10.600
Major cases?

330
00:14:10.734 --> 00:14:12.333
Yeah.

331
00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:16.066
Thanks. Mason.

332
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.900
Mason.

333
00:14:18.033 --> 00:14:21.667
Notepad.

334
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.433
I have my notepad.

335
00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:26.166
You have to take
notes too. okay?

336
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.500
It's good to have more
than one perspective.

337
00:14:28.633 --> 00:14:29.600
Yes. sir.

338
00:14:31.133 --> 00:14:37.266
Miss Barry. I'm
Detective Tom Shultz.

339
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.166
I'm sorry for your loss.

340
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.667
and I know this is the
last thing you wanna be

341
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.266
doing right now. but I have
to ask you some questions

342
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.233
about your friend. okay?

343
00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:45.700
Okay.

344
00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:50.233
So how long have
you known Miss Smiley?

345
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:52.533
Dr. Smiley. actually.

346
00:14:53.967 --> 00:14:58.667
She's a. um.

347
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.166
Was.

348
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.300
She was a psychiatrist.

349
00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:11.066
And how long have
you known Dr. Smiley?

350
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.333
Uh.

351
00:15:13.467 --> 00:15:17.734
When she first moved to
town about four years ago.

352
00:15:17.867 --> 00:15:20.800
She was a counselor at my
daughter Olive's school.

353
00:15:20.934 --> 00:15:21.900
Elk Park Prep.

354
00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:25.967
But she's only been doing
that for like a year.

355
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.834
She has a private
practice and. um.

356
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.400
Olive was a client of
hers when my marriage

357
00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:35.500
was coming apart.

358
00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:38.800
She married?

359
00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:40.567
- No.
- Children?

360
00:15:45.767 --> 00:15:47.066
You said you saw
her this afternoon.

361
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.667
Where was that?

362
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.000
Uh. the luncheon.
the booster club.

363
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.734
I was catering.

364
00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:57.066
Was there alcohol
at the lunch?

365
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.300
Mimosas.

366
00:15:58.433 --> 00:15:59.967
I'm sure that Laura
didn't have any.

367
00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:01.467
You know. it was just
mostly for parents.

368
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.967
you know. the big donors.

369
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.967
She have a heart condition?

370
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.967
No.

371
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.066
Her health. as
far as you know?

372
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:13.133
She was a skier.
a runner. a hiker.

373
00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:14.633
- Was she depressed?
- No.

374
00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:19.533
That was a quick no.

375
00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:22.967
Why are you
asking me all this?

376
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.867
There's no skid marks.

377
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.967
No signs that Dr.
Smiley tried to stop.

378
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.533
We'll know more when
we've done the autopsy.

379
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:38.367
but for now we're treating
this as a suspicious death.

380
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.800
Hi.

381
00:16:55.934 --> 00:16:56.967
Hi.

382
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.066
Did you figure out the. um-

383
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.233
Cause of death?

384
00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:01.834
Yeah.

385
00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:05.700
Can I come in?

386
00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:11.467
Sure. yes. Please.

387
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.734
So. uh. when is
the autopsy done?

388
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.300
Well. in a different
sized city. not long.

389
00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:20.467
but Ferma County has
a medical examiner

390
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.033
that happens to be at
a conference in Florida

391
00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:24.700
and she's not back for
a couple more days.

392
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:26.367
So then what happens?

393
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.400
Forensics is
processing her car.

394
00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:30.533
and they've confirmed
that there was nothing

395
00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:32.133
done to disable it.

396
00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:33.700
What. it?

397
00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:36.967
Are you saying that you think
that someone might've. what?

398
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.300
No. I'm saying
what I already said.

399
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.633
Her death is suspicious.

400
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.400
and it's my job to look
at every possibility.

401
00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:51.300
You mind if I ask you
a few more questions?

402
00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:53.233
Okay if I keep cooking?

403
00:17:53.367 --> 00:17:54.700
Sure.

404
00:17:56.934 --> 00:18:01.100
So. um. Laura's license. it
had a Denver address on it.

405
00:18:01.233 --> 00:18:02.433
She kept her condo.

406
00:18:02.567 --> 00:18:03.633
Uses it as an Airbnb.

407
00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:04.700
So she's not married.

408
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:08.033
She seeing anyone?

409
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:10.100
No.

410
00:18:10.233 --> 00:18:13.033
Why the hesitation?

411
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:16.633
There's. there's just
this ugly rumor going around

412
00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:19.100
that she's having an
affair with a married man.

413
00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:23.033
but it's not true. and
Laura swore it wasn't.

414
00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:24.433
Okay. well. who was it?

415
00:18:24.567 --> 00:18:25.633
Archie Dennison.

416
00:18:26.734 --> 00:18:29.700
His wife's Adele.

417
00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:32.266
Does Adele know
about this gossip?

418
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.767
As far as I know. she
probably started it.

419
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.300
Would you like me to give
you a tour of my house?

420
00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:41.300
No. I'm fine.

421
00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:43.867
How long have Dr. Smiley
and Mr. Dennison been-

422
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.867
Look. hey!

423
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.533
They haven't been anything.

424
00:18:48.734 --> 00:18:50.767
I just told you that.

425
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.266
How long have Dr.
Smiley and Mr. Dennison

426
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.800
been allegedly involved?

427
00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:01.433
I heard the rumor
a few days ago.

428
00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:03.934
And were Archie and Adele
at the booster club luncheon?

429
00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:07.333
Yes. they both
were because Adele is

430
00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:08.867
the president of the boosters.

431
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.767
Anything happen there
between the Dennisons

432
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.867
and Dr. Smiley?

433
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.600
What?

434
00:19:14.734 --> 00:19:17.433
Archie had a few
too many mimosas.

435
00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:19.600
and he's a flirt.
but not with Laura.

436
00:19:19.734 --> 00:19:24.600
and Adele and Archie left
hours before it was even over.

437
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.266
What do they do.
Archie and Adele?

438
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.533
Well. Adele is rich and
Archie is married to Adele.

439
00:19:32.667 --> 00:19:36.200
but apparently he
is now partnered up

440
00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:40.033
with my ex-husband to help
build a wellness center.

441
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:43.834
You have something
against wellness centers?

442
00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:45.333
Not at all. no.

443
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:47.767
I just would never expect
for either one of them

444
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.033
to be involved with one.

445
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.133
Gotcha.

446
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.033
Well. thanks for the coffee.

447
00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:55.834
Look. I'm sorry.

448
00:19:55.967 --> 00:19:57.767
I'm just usually not. um-

449
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.333
Dealing with the
death of a dear friend

450
00:19:59.467 --> 00:20:02.166
while talking to a
detective in your kitchen?

451
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.266
Pretty much.

452
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.033
I'll let you get
back to your cooking.

453
00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:15.967
Uh. listen.

454
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.166
This probably doesn't
mean anything.

455
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.600
but at the luncheon

456
00:20:22.734 --> 00:20:24.266
Laura asked to talk to me

457
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.133
and she wanted to
talk in private.

458
00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:30.266
That's why I was on the
Canyon Road tonight.

459
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.867
I was going to see her.

460
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:36.934
And you have no idea
what it was about?

461
00:20:40.567 --> 00:20:41.934
I'll see myself out.

462
00:20:56.633 --> 00:20:58.433
Mr. Bowman?

463
00:20:58.567 --> 00:21:00.533
Do you know about...

464
00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:01.667
Dr. Smiley?

465
00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:04.233
I do.

466
00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:05.834
And we're gonna make a lot
of space today in class

467
00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:07.033
to talk about it.

468
00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:10.900
Go on in. kiddo.

469
00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:18.600
How are you?

470
00:21:18.734 --> 00:21:19.900
A mess.

471
00:21:20.033 --> 00:21:21.000
I bet.

472
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.100
Listen. ah. we can
take a rain check

473
00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:27.100
this Friday at The Bistro.

474
00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:30.700
No. I. uh. I actually
think it'll be good.

475
00:21:32.734 --> 00:21:35.133
And I'm looking forward
to it.

476
00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:36.266
Me. too.

477
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.834
Take care of her.

478
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.000
I will.

479
00:22:58.033 --> 00:22:59.066
Excuse me. Goldy?

480
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.800
Hi.

481
00:23:02.934 --> 00:23:05.900
Oh.

482
00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:07.533
You must've heard.

483
00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:09.800
It's. um.

484
00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:11.700
It's devastating.

485
00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:15.200
So. so tragic.

486
00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:17.467
The police called this morning.

487
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.567
I just. I...

488
00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:21.867
I can't believe it.

489
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.867
I know.

490
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.734
Oh. I know.

491
00:23:24.867 --> 00:23:29.967
Oh. I'm so sorry.

492
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.967
Goldy. please let
me know if I can help

493
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.133
in any way with the funeral.

494
00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:36.667
That's so nice. thank you.

495
00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:40.800
Dr. Gentle?

496
00:23:44.834 --> 00:23:46.033
Dr. Gentle?

497
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:47.133
Yes.

498
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.367
Detective Tom Shultz.

499
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.800
We spoke earlier.

500
00:23:51.934 --> 00:23:52.900
Owen Gentle.

501
00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.433
My condolences.

502
00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:56.567
Thank you.

503
00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.867
Miss Barry. what are you?

504
00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:01.066
What are you doing here?

505
00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:06.767
I just came by to
make sure that Owen

506
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.033
had heard the news.

507
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.033
Well. I told you not to
touch anything in her office.

508
00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:15.867
And I heeded your wishes.

509
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.667
So what were you
doing in there?

510
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.700
Uh.

511
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:22.800
Actually. I was in the office.

512
00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:29.033
Okay.

513
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.266
Well. I need to speak to you.

514
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.133
but I have to talk to
you first. Dr. Gentle.

515
00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:34.600
And I really need
to get to work.

516
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:35.600
That wasn't a request.

517
00:24:35.734 --> 00:24:37.100
You have somewhere we can talk?

518
00:24:37.233 --> 00:24:38.100
Uh. of course.

519
00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:39.400
My office is right over here.

520
00:24:43.266 --> 00:24:47.100
Have a seat.

521
00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:09.166
- Look. I don't-
- Come with me.

522
00:25:10.567 --> 00:25:12.333
What were you doing in
Dr. Smiley's office?

523
00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:15.266
I was. what does that mean?

524
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.767
It's a pretty direct question.

525
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.333
I was. I wasn't
doing anything.

526
00:25:18.467 --> 00:25:21.200
I was only in there for 30
seconds before Owen came in.

527
00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:22.700
Well. unfortunately we
don't have security cameras

528
00:25:22.834 --> 00:25:23.867
to prove that. do we?

529
00:25:25.333 --> 00:25:29.333
What are you implying?

530
00:25:29.467 --> 00:25:31.867
I think your
behavior is suspicious.

531
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.033
Suspicious?

532
00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:35.000
Yes. it's suspicious.

533
00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:36.000
So answer my question.

534
00:25:36.133 --> 00:25:37.266
What are you doing here?

535
00:25:42.233 --> 00:25:44.834
I was dropping
Olive off at school

536
00:25:44.967 --> 00:25:48.767
when I saw Adele coming out
of Laura's counseling office.

537
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.600
Adele didn't see me. but
why would she be in there?

538
00:25:52.734 --> 00:25:54.367
And I went to open the
door. but it was locked.

539
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.633
Why didn't you
call me. Miss Barry?

540
00:25:58.133 --> 00:25:59.033
Well. next time I will!

541
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:01.567
Good.

542
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.600
You being here. did you find
out more about Laura's death?

543
00:26:10.633 --> 00:26:12.734
Did you bake
chocolate-covered cookies

544
00:26:12.867 --> 00:26:13.734
for the luncheon?

545
00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:15.166
Chocolate-coated shortbread.

546
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.433
Well. we recovered
chocolate-covered shortbread

547
00:26:16.567 --> 00:26:18.533
from the front seat
of Dr. Smiley's car.

548
00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:24.333
Well. she probably
just took some to go.

549
00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:28.166
Why are you asking me this?

550
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.066
Yeah. well. we're still
processing her office.

551
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.600
But if you hear or see or
even think of anything else.

552
00:26:36.734 --> 00:26:37.734
you call me.

553
00:26:37.867 --> 00:26:39.000
Of course.

554
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.400
Good.

555
00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:43.500
One more thing.

556
00:26:43.633 --> 00:26:44.934
You know Julian Geddes?

557
00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:46.767
- Yeah. that's Adele's son.
- Yeah. from her first husband.

558
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.000
- Right.
- Yeah.

559
00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:52.100
Did Laura mention
anything to you about him?

560
00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:54.567
Why would Laura talk
to me about Julian?

561
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.033
Why would she?

562
00:27:07.266 --> 00:27:08.300
- Ah!
- Hey.

563
00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:09.500
Well. this is kismet.

564
00:27:09.633 --> 00:27:10.500
What is?

565
00:27:10.633 --> 00:27:12.734
I was just coming to find you.

566
00:27:12.867 --> 00:27:15.133
I. um. I actually
had a question.

567
00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:18.900
Did you ever teach
a Julian Geddes?

568
00:27:19.033 --> 00:27:20.900
- That's weird.
- Why?

569
00:27:21.033 --> 00:27:23.166
Well. Julian was a
junior my first year here.

570
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.734
but what's weird is that
I saw him yesterday.

571
00:27:26.967 --> 00:27:28.300
Where?

572
00:27:28.433 --> 00:27:29.800
There.

573
00:27:29.934 --> 00:27:31.233
I was on my way from the
dining hall after the luncheon

574
00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:33.667
and I saw him pacing
around the parking lot.

575
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.633
And you. you recognized him?

576
00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:38.233
Not at first.

577
00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:40.300
No. I just saw a man lurking
around the school parking lot

578
00:27:40.433 --> 00:27:41.900
with a hoodie on. so.

579
00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:42.900
Hmm.

580
00:27:43.033 --> 00:27:43.900
Yeah.

581
00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:45.400
Said he was waiting for someone.

582
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.066
Can you show me where
exactly he was pacing?

583
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.734
Yeah.

584
00:27:52.867 --> 00:27:54.266
I was there.

585
00:27:55.867 --> 00:27:58.133
He was.

586
00:27:58.266 --> 00:28:01.967
he was probably here.

587
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.100
Yeah.

588
00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:05.133
Why?

589
00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:07.900
Is. is he in trouble or?

590
00:28:08.033 --> 00:28:09.033
Is everything okay?

591
00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:10.133
Uh.

592
00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:14.133
That's...

593
00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:16.800
Suspicious.

594
00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:21.700
Yeah.

595
00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:35.800
- Hello?
- Adele?

596
00:28:35.934 --> 00:28:37.033
It's Goldy Barry.

597
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.033
- Hi.
- Hi.

598
00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:55.600
You found the place?

599
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.200
I did. yes.

600
00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:03.767
You'll have to forgive me.

601
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.500
My mind has been in a
million different directions.

602
00:29:06.633 --> 00:29:08.000
Ah. I know the feeling.

603
00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:09.166
I'm sure you do.

604
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.500
That meal yesterday?

605
00:29:10.633 --> 00:29:11.934
My goodness.

606
00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:13.867
I mean. I can barely
manage not to burn toast.

607
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.867
Oh.

608
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.133
I don't believe that.

609
00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:20.834
Well. you don't know me.

610
00:29:25.734 --> 00:29:28.934
Did I see your son
at school yesterday?

611
00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:30.433
- Julian?
- Yeah.

612
00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:32.767
I can't imagine that he'd
be back at his alma mater.

613
00:29:35.233 --> 00:29:38.600
And he lives here
now with you. right?

614
00:29:38.734 --> 00:29:41.467
In the guest quarters for now.

615
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600
Hmm.

616
00:29:46.066 --> 00:29:48.000
Why do you ask?

617
00:29:48.133 --> 00:29:50.600
Oh. um.

618
00:29:50.734 --> 00:29:54.700
I'm always on the lookout
for potential cater waiters.

619
00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:58.800
Well. I will pass that along.

620
00:29:58.934 --> 00:29:59.867
Here you are.

621
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.367
Thank you so much.

622
00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:09.934
Goldy.

623
00:30:10.066 --> 00:30:11.767
I heard about Laura Smiley.

624
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.834
and I know the two
of you were friends.

625
00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:15.667
and I am so sorry.

626
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.767
Thank you.

627
00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:19.767
I mean. I can't
understand why the police

628
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.000
are calling her
death suspicious.

629
00:30:22.133 --> 00:30:24.100
Haven't they heard the
cliche doctors are the last

630
00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:25.200
people to seek help?

631
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.767
Well. I don't know that we
should be making assumptions.

632
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.100
What else could it be?

633
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.100
I think that she was more
fragile that she let on.

634
00:30:38.233 --> 00:30:40.834
Working those two
terribly draining jobs?

635
00:30:40.967 --> 00:30:43.500
Is it any surprise
she literally ends up

636
00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:45.033
driving herself to death?

637
00:30:48.133 --> 00:30:50.600
Well. I. um.

638
00:30:50.734 --> 00:30:54.934
I realize that you probably
weren't the president

639
00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:56.133
of her fan club.

640
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.333
You heard the rumors.

641
00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:02.433
I did.

642
00:31:04.233 --> 00:31:08.734
And Laura assured me that
there is no truth to them.

643
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.834
Goldy.

644
00:31:11.967 --> 00:31:14.333
I saw her.

645
00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:18.900
I saw her sneaking out
of here late at night.

646
00:31:19.033 --> 00:31:21.266
When?

647
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.834
About a week ago.

648
00:31:23.967 --> 00:31:26.500
I was in Denver at the opera

649
00:31:26.633 --> 00:31:32.233
and I had a headache
so I came home early.

650
00:31:32.367 --> 00:31:37.100
And my husband claims that he
didn't even know she was here.

651
00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:41.900
Adele. I'm so sorry.

652
00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:44.400
My father warned me.

653
00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:47.500
Never marry a handsome
man. and I married two.

654
00:31:51.967 --> 00:31:55.834
I never met your
first husband.

655
00:31:55.967 --> 00:32:01.633
Uh. he was gone before Julian
and I came back to Elk Park.

656
00:32:01.767 --> 00:32:04.967
Gone as in?

657
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.967
There's someone at the gate.

658
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.967
Would you excuse me?

659
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.166
Of course. yeah.

660
00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:25.567
Miss Barry. you tell me
this was a coincidence?

661
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.233
- I was just-
- Detective?

662
00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:30.233
I've just been advised by my
husband not to speak to you.

663
00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:31.567
Seriously?

664
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.567
I wouldn't joke
about legal matters.

665
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.734
Look. I just. I just wanna
ask you a couple questions.

666
00:32:37.867 --> 00:32:39.633
And you're perfectly
welcome to do that.

667
00:32:39.767 --> 00:32:42.567
I'll have my attorney contact
you and schedule a meeting.

668
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.767
Goldy. thank you so much.

669
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.900
No worries.

670
00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:53.233
What are you doing here?

671
00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:54.300
Getting paid for yesterday.

672
00:32:54.433 --> 00:32:55.300
Oh. yeah. really.

673
00:32:55.433 --> 00:32:56.300
No. seriously.

674
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:57.400
Look. See?

675
00:33:01.867 --> 00:33:03.033
So you're telling me
you didn't come here

676
00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:05.700
because of what you told
me you saw her doing?

677
00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:08.533
I will tell you that.
and I will tell you more.

678
00:33:08.667 --> 00:33:09.967
Just not here.

679
00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:16.467
Fine.

680
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:23.700
Follow me.

681
00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:36.567
As you can see. there's
a lot you don't know

682
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.800
that goes into solving a crime.

683
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.300
which is why I need
you to stop trying

684
00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:41.567
to do my job for me.

685
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.200
Look. I'm not
trying to do your job.

686
00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:55.033
I care about Laura and
about what happened to her.

687
00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.066
And I know this community.

688
00:34:02.667 --> 00:34:03.700
What did you want to tell me?

689
00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:05.100
So after you
mentioned Julian to me.

690
00:34:05.233 --> 00:34:07.533
I went to ask a
friend about him. and-

691
00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:09.967
You told somebody I
was looking into Julian?

692
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.800
Oh. give me some
credit. Detective. no.

693
00:34:11.934 --> 00:34:13.033
I just asked a friend.

694
00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:14.033
Name?

695
00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:15.066
Brad Bowman.

696
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.300
He's a teacher.

697
00:34:16.433 --> 00:34:18.266
Teaches history and
was at the luncheon.

698
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.300
Yeah. give me some
credit. Miss Barry.

699
00:34:21.834 --> 00:34:25.033
Well. I asked Brad if
he had ever taught Julian.

700
00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:27.600
but he said that he
actually saw Julian

701
00:34:27.734 --> 00:34:30.100
in the parking lot
after the luncheon.

702
00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:31.700
Yeah. I know. I know.

703
00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:34.300
Dr. Gentle saw him there. too.

704
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.433
So that's why you
asked me about him.

705
00:34:39.567 --> 00:34:43.200
Well. Brad also said
that he asked Julian

706
00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:45.200
what he was doing there
and he said that he was

707
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.767
waiting on someone
and he was standing

708
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.266
right in front of Laura's car.

709
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.200
Yeah. Dr. Smiley
invited him there.

710
00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:53.567
How do you know that?

711
00:34:54.934 --> 00:34:56.266
'Cause she sent him an email.

712
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.600
What did the email say?

713
00:34:57.734 --> 00:34:59.600
I'm not discussing
this with you. okay?

714
00:34:59.734 --> 00:35:01.100
- Okay. okay.
- Yeah.

715
00:35:01.233 --> 00:35:02.800
Thank you very much. Miss Barry.

716
00:35:05.233 --> 00:35:06.333
There's just one more thing.

717
00:35:06.467 --> 00:35:07.467
Um.

718
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.333
I did go to Adele's house
to pick up my check.

719
00:35:12.467 --> 00:35:16.367
But also. she has a desk
drawer in her office

720
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.433
full of prescription medications.

721
00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:21.600
and she tried to convince me
that Laura took her own life.

722
00:35:21.734 --> 00:35:24.033
and I am pretty sure
that her ex-husband

723
00:35:24.166 --> 00:35:25.266
was unfaithful to her.

724
00:35:28.633 --> 00:35:31.600
Where did Adele live before
she came back to Elk Park?

725
00:35:31.734 --> 00:35:32.700
Salt Lake.

726
00:35:43.233 --> 00:35:47.333
Whoa.

727
00:35:47.467 --> 00:35:50.367
Mr. Geddes' car

728
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.333
found by hikers.

729
00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:57.367
He drove off a cliff.

730
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.800
Vincent Geddes seems like-

731
00:36:07.934 --> 00:36:10.767
A con artist who married
rich and sponged off his wife?

732
00:36:12.266 --> 00:36:14.066
You know. Adele filed for
divorce a couple months

733
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.834
before the crash and
then she rescinded it.

734
00:36:17.767 --> 00:36:19.066
Why?

735
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.500
Well. maybe they made up.

736
00:36:22.033 --> 00:36:26.967
Or maybe she didn't
file a prenup.

737
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.166
I bet I could
find out from Adele.

738
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.567
And she won't have her lawyers
there when I talk to her.

739
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.734
Miss Barry.

740
00:36:35.867 --> 00:36:37.734
You gotta stop
with the Miss Barry.

741
00:36:37.867 --> 00:36:38.900
It's Goldy.

742
00:36:39.033 --> 00:36:40.000
Okay. Goldy.

743
00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.066
I realize you might think
you're in a position to help.

744
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.233
I am in a position to help.

745
00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:48.734
People talk to
me. they trust me.

746
00:36:48.867 --> 00:36:50.300
And I've already helped you.

747
00:36:50.433 --> 00:36:51.467
Well. I don't need your help.

748
00:36:54.433 --> 00:36:55.400
Oh. am I interrupting?

749
00:36:55.533 --> 00:36:57.333
Yes.

750
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:03.400
Call me if you need more help.

751
00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:07.200
Good to see you. Mason.

752
00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:10.867
More help with what?

753
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.700
This case.

754
00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:14.133
Oh.

755
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:16.400
Well. she is very helpful.

756
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.200
I. I...

757
00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:21.967
Drop.

758
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.867
Hey. Mar.

759
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.867
Hey. Goldy.

760
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.233
I am so sorry about Laura.

761
00:37:31.367 --> 00:37:33.467
Yeah. it's awful.

762
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.300
I'll swing by her house to
make sure everything's okay.

763
00:37:36.433 --> 00:37:37.300
You know?

764
00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:39.033
Trying to stay proactive.

765
00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:41.133
Hmm. well. speaking
of proactive.

766
00:37:41.266 --> 00:37:43.367
I was talking to
Archie Dennison.

767
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.066
Yes. I cleaned up
the glass. remember?

768
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.233
No. just now.

769
00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:49.367
Actually. we had lunch.

770
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.533
Marla. he is after you.

771
00:37:51.667 --> 00:37:53.467
Well. and I'm after a job.

772
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.367
So I know that we were both
invited to Adele's birthday.

773
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.900
but how would you
like to work it?

774
00:37:59.033 --> 00:38:00.533
Seriously?

775
00:38:00.667 --> 00:38:03.467
Yeah. Archie had a different
caterer and florist set up.

776
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.033
He was so wowed with the
luncheon that I convinced him

777
00:38:06.166 --> 00:38:07.867
to go with us.

778
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.700
Now I know it's coming up
fast and you're gonna have to

779
00:38:09.834 --> 00:38:11.266
spend a little bit more time
at their house. but I'm-

780
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.467
I'll take it.

781
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.767
Oh. that was easy.

782
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.367
Shall we make a plan
over dinner. chez you?

783
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.200
As long as you
bring me flowers.

784
00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:21.367
Of course.

785
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.700
I'll see you tonight.

786
00:38:22.834 --> 00:38:24.433
Bye.

787
00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:50.000
Pick up. come on.

788
00:39:50.133 --> 00:39:51.934
Pick up. pick up. pick up.

789
00:39:52.066 --> 00:39:53.033
Goldy.

790
00:39:53.166 --> 00:39:54.300
- I'm in Laura's house.
- What?

791
00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:56.133
And somebody else is
in the house. upstairs.

792
00:39:56.266 --> 00:39:57.166
What are you doing?

793
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.767
And I'm hiding in the closet.

794
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.600
Stay there and stay hidden.

795
00:40:00.734 --> 00:40:01.767
I'm on the way.

796
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.934
They're banging around.

797
00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:04.533
I think they're
looking for something.

798
00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:06.266
I just. I can't see.

799
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.834
If I could just get
a little closer.

800
00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:09.834
Stay there and don't hang up.

801
00:40:09.967 --> 00:40:10.967
Okay. okay.

802
00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:14.000
Hey. hey!

803
00:40:14.133 --> 00:40:15.500
We need a patrol car on Laura
Smiley's house right now.

804
00:40:15.633 --> 00:40:16.633
Sirens and lights.

805
00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:19.166
Yeah. we're comin'.

806
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.266
Okay.

807
00:40:28.066 --> 00:40:28.934
We're rolling.

808
00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:30.033
Stay put.

809
00:40:49.734 --> 00:40:51.600
They're leaving.

810
00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:53.333
We're almost there.

811
00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:58.433
Okay.

812
00:41:00.567 --> 00:41:02.600
Better?

813
00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:07.934
Thank you. yeah.

814
00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:11.233
Well. you
were definitely
trespassing this time.

815
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.367
You gonna arrest me?

816
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.000
Don't tempt me.

817
00:41:25.967 --> 00:41:26.834
Did they take anything?

818
00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:28.934
No. no. nothing important.

819
00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:32.467
We'd already been here yesterday
and took all of her files.

820
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.567
Her laptop?

821
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.667
At the station.

822
00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:45.900
I wanna show you something.

823
00:41:46.033 --> 00:41:50.734
I promise. that key was
not there when I got here.

824
00:41:50.867 --> 00:41:53.500
Well. you know
what that means.

825
00:41:53.633 --> 00:41:54.700
That whoever broke in
the house knew that there

826
00:41:54.834 --> 00:41:55.834
was a key under there.

827
00:41:55.967 --> 00:41:56.934
Well. I knew because
I water her plants

828
00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:58.100
when she's out of town.

829
00:41:58.233 --> 00:41:59.266
And you haven't
told anybody else?

830
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.333
No.

831
00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:01.967
No.

832
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.233
Ah. there she is.

833
00:42:05.133 --> 00:42:06.734
Tell her how many
goals you've scored?

834
00:42:06.867 --> 00:42:07.734
Yeah.

835
00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:08.834
You gonna brag?

836
00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:11.633
Maybe.

837
00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:13.767
Sorry. sorry. sorry.
sorry. sorry. ugh.

838
00:42:14.633 --> 00:42:16.000
Ah. that's okay.

839
00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:19.734
I was just in surgery and
handed over the scalpel.

840
00:42:19.867 --> 00:42:21.333
He's kidding. Mom.

841
00:42:21.467 --> 00:42:24.000
He was five minutes away
when you texted him.

842
00:42:24.133 --> 00:42:25.467
Guys.

843
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.734
We were with Owen.

844
00:42:26.867 --> 00:42:28.967
We were scouting the
wellness center site.

845
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:29.967
Wow.

846
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.734
You guys have land already.

847
00:42:31.867 --> 00:42:34.433
Yeah. Goldy. I told you.
we're serious about this.

848
00:42:36.533 --> 00:42:38.300
Well. thanks for being here.

849
00:42:38.433 --> 00:42:39.734
Ah. don't worry about it.

850
00:42:39.867 --> 00:42:42.066
You've got a lot going on.

851
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.166
You have no idea.

852
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.467
And I just got a new gig.

853
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.066
Adele Dennison's birthday party.

854
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.300
Wow.

855
00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:51.967
Means I am already a
week behind.

856
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.800
Okay. I'll tell you what.

857
00:42:53.934 --> 00:42:56.967
What would you think about
staying at Dad's house tonight?

858
00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.233
Can we order Vietnamese?

859
00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.133
Anything you want.

860
00:43:00.266 --> 00:43:01.133
Ah. you don't have to.

861
00:43:01.266 --> 00:43:02.800
No. I know. but I want to.

862
00:43:04.367 --> 00:43:05.233
Go on.

863
00:43:05.367 --> 00:43:06.266
Give your mom a hug.

864
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.800
Let's head out.

865
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.800
Well. as lousy as
he was as a husband.

866
00:43:15.934 --> 00:43:17.967
Richard is really
coming through as a dad.

867
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.367
Well. Olive has
this magical power

868
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.633
of making him forget
his gigantic ego.

869
00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:26.133
Well. he could've used
all of it at the luncheon.

870
00:43:26.266 --> 00:43:28.400
He can really go off on people.

871
00:43:28.533 --> 00:43:30.133
Don't ever let
him do that to you.

872
00:43:30.266 --> 00:43:32.133
Oh. I am not talking about me.

873
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.367
Who?

874
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.533
Okay. don't get upset.
but toward the end

875
00:43:37.667 --> 00:43:39.300
I was taking out some
trash and I saw him

876
00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:40.800
and Laura arguing.

877
00:43:42.266 --> 00:43:44.200
About what?

878
00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:45.300
I don't know.

879
00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:46.633
I was too far away to hear.

880
00:43:46.767 --> 00:43:47.734
Hmm.

881
00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:50.400
All right. all right. ready?

882
00:43:50.533 --> 00:43:53.734
Yes. please.

883
00:43:53.867 --> 00:43:54.834
Oh my goodness.

884
00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:56.967
What is in this?

885
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.066
Guess.

886
00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.633
Okay. well. um.

887
00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:02.200
Tomatoes. obviously.

888
00:44:02.333 --> 00:44:04.033
Oh. I'll get it.

889
00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:05.133
Okay.

890
00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:13.367
Mmm.

891
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.433
Detective.

892
00:44:15.567 --> 00:44:19.433
Did you come to arrest me?

893
00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:21.867
I'm beginning to think
you wanna be arrested.

894
00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:27.266
I came to tell you that I
got the medical examiner

895
00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.633
to come back a day early.

896
00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:34.100
Autopsy's gonna
be done tomorrow.

897
00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:37.033
Okay.

898
00:44:37.166 --> 00:44:38.867
Goldy.

899
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.633
You gonna introduce me?

900
00:44:41.767 --> 00:44:44.033
Um. this is
Detective Tom Shultz.

901
00:44:44.166 --> 00:44:46.200
Tom. this is my friend Marla.

902
00:44:48.233 --> 00:44:50.433
Um. Marla McGuire.

903
00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:52.800
You did the flowers
for the luncheon.

904
00:44:52.934 --> 00:44:54.633
I did.

905
00:44:54.767 --> 00:44:56.967
Did you wanna question me or?

906
00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:01.000
Marla and I are working
on a party for Saturday

907
00:45:01.133 --> 00:45:03.000
for Adele Dennison.

908
00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:04.300
Oh. you should come.

909
00:45:06.633 --> 00:45:09.000
You know what? I should come.

910
00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:12.433
But she'll never invite me.

911
00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:16.000
I'll let you two get back
to what you were doing.

912
00:45:16.133 --> 00:45:17.367
Nice to meet you.

913
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.467
You. too.

914
00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.266
Goodnight. Detective.

915
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.500
Okay.

916
00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:28.834
Um.

917
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:30.834
When were you gonna tell me
about this cute detective

918
00:45:30.967 --> 00:45:32.200
that has a little crush on you?

919
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.200
He does not.

920
00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:34.767
I'm helping him with something.

921
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.266
Uh-huh.

922
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.100
I am. and it would be
weird and unprofessional.

923
00:45:38.233 --> 00:45:41.033
and besides. I'm going out
with Brad Bowman on Friday.

924
00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:43.433
Oh. and you don't
think that's weird?

925
00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:44.834
Because he's Olive's teacher?

926
00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:46.667
No. because of him and Laura.

927
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.166
Him and Laura what?

928
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.600
He's Laura's ex.

929
00:45:49.734 --> 00:45:50.934
She didn't tell you that?

930
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.834
No.

931
00:45:56.967 --> 00:46:02.300
And neither did he.

932
00:46:02.433 --> 00:46:04.066
es Ma?

933
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.734
She said Laura
told her years ago

934
00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:07.667
when she first moved to town.

935
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.900
And Laura never told you?

936
00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:10.000
Nope.

937
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.400
Maybe it wasn't a
big deal to Laura.

938
00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:14.934
You know what?

939
00:46:15.066 --> 00:46:16.400
Maybe. I don't know. maybe
I could do some more digging

940
00:46:16.533 --> 00:46:18.000
tomorrow night.

941
00:46:18.133 --> 00:46:19.233
Tomorrow night?

942
00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:20.900
What do you. what do
you have tomorrow night?

943
00:46:21.934 --> 00:46:27.500
Brad and I are having dinner.

944
00:46:27.633 --> 00:46:29.500
Oh.

945
00:46:29.633 --> 00:46:33.166
Unless you think
it's a bad idea.

946
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.734
No. I don't think
it's a bad idea.

947
00:46:39.533 --> 00:46:42.800
Where's this dinner
taking place?

948
00:46:42.934 --> 00:46:45.166
The Bistro.

949
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.066
You know it?

950
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.900
Yeah. yeah. yup. heard of it.

951
00:46:53.033 --> 00:46:54.567
Hey.

952
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.967
Maybe you could be there. too.

953
00:47:00.166 --> 00:47:01.533
I don't think Brad
wants me at your dinner.

954
00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:03.533
No. no. not. not with us.

955
00:47:03.667 --> 00:47:06.867
You know. just in case
he. he tells me something

956
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.233
and I have to tell
you something or...

957
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.467
Something.

958
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.700
Yeah. okay.

959
00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:21.066
But you know. um. I
should bring a date.

960
00:47:23.033 --> 00:47:25.467
- Oh.
- Mason.

961
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.467
I'm taking you to
dinner tomorrow night.

962
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.200
Me?

963
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

964
00:47:45.934 --> 00:47:47.533
I have to tell you.
I was over the moon

965
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:49.633
when I found out Archie
had this inspired notion

966
00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:50.967
to get you to handle the event.

967
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.300
Ah. me. too.

968
00:47:52.433 --> 00:47:53.633
Although I was looking
forward to getting

969
00:47:53.767 --> 00:47:54.900
dressed up to attend.

970
00:47:55.033 --> 00:47:56.367
Oh. you'll still be attending.

971
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.300
No. no. no. no.
no. I'll be working.

972
00:47:58.433 --> 00:48:00.266
You'll be working
in a dual capacity.

973
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.467
so you can get dressed
up and bring a plus one.

974
00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:07.033
You're the boss.

975
00:48:07.166 --> 00:48:09.033
Literally.

976
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:10.767
So. how can I help you?

977
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.033
I have the guest list.

978
00:48:12.166 --> 00:48:13.934
I just need to scout.
make a detailed plan.

979
00:48:14.066 --> 00:48:16.200
I won't trouble you unless
I have any questions.

980
00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:18.700
Sounds like we're
in excellent hands.

981
00:48:18.834 --> 00:48:19.767
I'll let you get to it.

982
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.700

Hello?

999
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:10.967
Hi.

1000
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.600
Oh!

1001
00:50:12.734 --> 00:50:14.500
Archie!

1002
00:50:14.633 --> 00:50:16.266
Oh. you startled me.

1003
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.266
Whoops. sorry.

1004
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.367
Oh. it's okay.

1005
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.200
Um. do you. do you know
if this oven works?

1006
00:50:24.333 --> 00:50:26.934
Eh. well. we'd get it
fixed if the current tenant

1007
00:50:27.066 --> 00:50:28.367
would do any cooking.

1008
00:50:29.567 --> 00:50:30.667
Oh.

1009
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.533
Is this where your
stepson is staying?

1010
00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.500
Oh. It's okay.

1011
00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:37.100
I actually think
this will work better

1012
00:50:37.233 --> 00:50:39.667
for a staging area for my crew.

1013
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.934
Do you think Julian will mind?

1014
00:50:42.066 --> 00:50:44.367
Maybe I can use it as
an excuse to evict him.

1015
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.533
Yes. I know. I'm awful.

1016
00:50:47.667 --> 00:50:49.667
Truth is. I should be
grateful to Julian.

1017
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.266
His troubles are what
inspired me to build

1018
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.467
the wellness center.

1019
00:50:53.734 --> 00:50:55.533
Oh. I guess I
thought Richard had-

1020
00:50:55.667 --> 00:50:56.934
No. no.

1021
00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:58.500
I wanted to bring
in medical partners.

1022
00:50:58.633 --> 00:51:00.066
- Yeah.
- As I told Owen.

1023
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.500
it's my vision.

1024
00:51:01.633 --> 00:51:04.166
A state-of-the-art treatment
facility for anyone

1025
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.934
battling the illness
of addiction.

1026
00:51:07.367 --> 00:51:08.233
Like the Betty Ford Center.

1027
00:51:08.367 --> 00:51:09.433
Exactly.

1028
00:51:09.567 --> 00:51:11.734
We'll have capacity
for 100 residents.

1029
00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:13.767
Wow.

1030
00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.567
That's amazing.

1031
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.734
So I'm assuming then that
Julian will be at the party.

1032
00:51:20.867 --> 00:51:21.767
Who knows?

1033
00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.934
He's as reliable as the wind.

1034
00:51:24.066 --> 00:51:25.567
Adele's been trying
to reach him for days.

1035
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.734
No answer.

1036
00:51:28.633 --> 00:51:30.166
And speak of the wife.

1037
00:51:31.934 --> 00:51:32.834
Hello. darling.

1038
00:51:32.967 --> 00:51:34.767
Just helping Goldy.

1039
00:51:36.066 --> 00:51:38.233
On my way.

1040
00:51:38.367 --> 00:51:40.400
Excuse me.

1041
00:51:44.834 --> 00:51:45.800
Do you mind?

1042
00:51:45.934 --> 00:51:46.834
It's a bit warm in here.

1043
00:51:46.967 --> 00:51:48.500
Not at all.

1044
00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:55.934
Miss Langsam.

1045
00:51:56.066 --> 00:51:57.000
Detective Tom Shultz.

1046
00:51:57.133 --> 00:51:58.000
Sarah's fine.

1047
00:51:58.133 --> 00:51:59.734
And this is my husband.

1048
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:02.734
Archie Dennison.
this is Deputy Kildea.

1049
00:52:02.867 --> 00:52:04.200
Mason.

1050
00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:07.734
My first name. Mason.

1051
00:52:07.867 --> 00:52:10.000
I thought we were all
saying our first names.

1052
00:52:10.133 --> 00:52:11.567
Sorry.

1053
00:52:14.533 --> 00:52:15.800
Mind if we take a seat?

1054
00:52:15.934 --> 00:52:17.734
Please.

1055
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.400
Well. thank you
for seeing us today.

1056
00:52:22.533 --> 00:52:24.233
As I said on the phone.
we're viewing this

1057
00:52:24.367 --> 00:52:26.633
as a suspicious death.

1058
00:52:26.767 --> 00:52:28.900
I'm not sure what's
suspicious about it.

1059
00:52:29.033 --> 00:52:31.300
She was a deeply troubled woman
who decided to end it all.

1060
00:52:31.433 --> 00:52:32.900
What makes you say that?

1061
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.633
Well. isn't it obvious?

1062
00:52:35.767 --> 00:52:37.066
Can you be more specific?

1063
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.967
Uh. I didn't know
her terribly well.

1064
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.633
Well. you knew her
well enough to diagnose

1065
00:52:42.767 --> 00:52:43.633
her mental state. though.

1066
00:52:43.767 --> 00:52:45.233
Detective.

1067
00:52:46.934 --> 00:52:51.233
How well did you
know her. Mr. Dennison?

1068
00:52:51.367 --> 00:52:52.800
Only socially.

1069
00:52:52.934 --> 00:52:55.734
Ah. 'cause a week
ago. Mrs. Dennison.

1070
00:52:55.867 --> 00:52:58.133
didn't you see Dr. Smiley
leaving here late at night?

1071
00:52:58.266 --> 00:52:59.467
Do you have
an eyewitness to that?

1072
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.133
Mrs. Dennison told
several people that.

1073
00:53:01.266 --> 00:53:02.800
So no eyewitness.

1074
00:53:02.934 --> 00:53:04.567
I'd consider it idle
gossip not worthy of

1075
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.800
your taxpayer funded time.

1076
00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:07.900
Well. gossip starts
somewhere. right?

1077
00:53:08.033 --> 00:53:09.967
And I'm afraid
it started with me.

1078
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.066
Adele.

1079
00:53:12.934 --> 00:53:15.200
I imagined an affair.

1080
00:53:15.333 --> 00:53:17.800
Did you imagine the same
thing with your first husband?

1081
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.700
Vincent?

1082
00:53:22.834 --> 00:53:25.867
I'd love to speak to Vincent.

1083
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.700
but that's not possible.

1084
00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:29.700
I'm not sure what
Adele's prior marriage

1085
00:53:29.834 --> 00:53:30.900
has to do with any of this.

1086
00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:32.500
You haven't told
your attorney. Adele?

1087
00:53:37.667 --> 00:53:40.900
Vincent Geddes was
killed in a car accident.

1088
00:53:42.934 --> 00:53:45.867
The kind where the
car falls off a cliff.

1089
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:46.867
This interview's over.

1090
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.300
Hold on a second. okay?

1091
00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:50.867
Detective. my clients
have nothing further to say.

1092
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.734
So unless they're under
arrest. I'll show you both out.

1093
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.433
We'll be in touch.

1094
00:54:06.567 --> 00:54:07.533
You have my number.

1095
00:54:14.567 --> 00:54:15.600
He was accusing you-

1096
00:54:15.734 --> 00:54:18.200
Yes. of killing Vincent.

1097
00:54:18.333 --> 00:54:19.700
Archie. I figured that out.

1098
00:54:21.734 --> 00:54:26.700
And of killing Laura.

1099
00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:30.133
My darling Archie. what
possible motive would I have

1100
00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:31.600
for killing Laura?

1101
00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:33.667
You told me there was nothing
between the two of you.

1102
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.800
There wasn't.

1103
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.300
But

1104
00:54:38.433 --> 00:54:40.800
hypothetically.

1105
00:54:40.934 --> 00:54:43.967
if I did discover that you lied.

1106
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.300
then I guess I would
just simply divorce you.

1107
00:54:47.433 --> 00:54:49.400
as per our prenuptial agreement.

1108
00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.967
All that money.

1109
00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.333
Gone.

1110
00:55:00.467 --> 00:55:03.600
And that is a lot
of money to lose.

1111
00:55:07.967 --> 00:55:09.033
That would be a
perfect motive for you

1112
00:55:09.166 --> 00:55:11.266
to keep Laura
quiet. wouldn't it?

1113
00:55:17.233 --> 00:55:22.100
Take this. will you?

1114
00:55:22.233 --> 00:55:26.700
I'm heading to book club.

1115
00:55:51.467 --> 00:55:53.000
He threw the glass?

1116
00:55:53.133 --> 00:55:56.333
He threw his glass.
and it was nice crystal.

1117
00:55:56.467 --> 00:55:58.767
Well. I mean.
Adele did it. right?

1118
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.400
Deputy.

1119
00:56:00.533 --> 00:56:01.400
But the way Archie lost it
like that. maybe he did it.

1120
00:56:01.533 --> 00:56:02.400
Mason.

1121
00:56:02.533 --> 00:56:03.467
And what happened to Julian?

1122
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.900
Maybe he's dead. too!
- Mason.

1123
00:56:06.033 --> 00:56:07.967
Sorry. I got excited.

1124
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.500
Never been part of a
homicide investigation.

1125
00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:10.834
And you still might
not be when we're waiting

1126
00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.000
on the autopsy results.

1127
00:56:12.133 --> 00:56:13.500
Well. yeah.

1128
00:56:13.633 --> 00:56:16.400
Sure. but you said it
was a suspicious death.

1129
00:56:16.533 --> 00:56:18.066
and now it's really
suspicious with these two.

1130
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.066
Yeah. and now they
won't talk to me.

1131
00:56:22.934 --> 00:56:24.400
Why don't you come to
Adele's birthday party

1132
00:56:24.533 --> 00:56:26.066
with me as my plus one?

1133
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.800
- Could he do that?
- You're gonna do that?

1134
00:56:27.934 --> 00:56:29.900
The invitation
said you and a guest.

1135
00:56:32.133 --> 00:56:34.233
Do I have to wear a tux?

1136
00:56:34.367 --> 00:56:36.800
Fresh tie will do.

1137
00:56:36.934 --> 00:56:38.333
Anyway.

1138
00:56:38.467 --> 00:56:40.834
I have to go talk to
my daughter's father.

1139
00:56:45.433 --> 00:56:47.734
She's divorced.

1140
00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:49.500
That's why she
said it like that.

1141
00:56:49.633 --> 00:56:51.467
I know that.

1142
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.834
I think it looks nice.

1143
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.166
Enter.

1144
00:57:07.033 --> 00:57:08.533
Uh-oh.

1145
00:57:08.667 --> 00:57:10.200
Am I in trouble?

1146
00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:12.066
Now why would you assume that?

1147
00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:17.734
Skier?

1148
00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:20.567
No. snowboarder. but that
was from a car accident.

1149
00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.567
Oh. no.

1150
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.800
He okay?

1151
00:57:22.934 --> 00:57:26.066
She. and she will
be when I'm done.

1152
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.800
Okay. really though.
am I in trouble?

1153
00:57:31.934 --> 00:57:35.066
Not trouble. no.

1154
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.700
Um.

1155
00:57:36.834 --> 00:57:37.900
I just. uh.

1156
00:57:43.867 --> 00:57:46.200
Were you and Laura fighting
outside the dining hall

1157
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:47.233
the day of the luncheon?

1158
00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:48.467
Wow.

1159
00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.467
Seriously?

1160
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.800
I'm just asking a question.

1161
00:57:52.934 --> 00:57:55.533
Oh. just like old
times when you would

1162
00:57:55.667 --> 00:57:58.066
just ask a question
that sounded a lot more

1163
00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.967
like an accusation.

1164
00:58:01.667 --> 00:58:02.934
This is not about us.

1165
00:58:03.066 --> 00:58:04.100
- No?
- No.

1166
00:58:04.233 --> 00:58:06.200
Okay. well. um.

1167
00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:08.100
I wasn't fighting with Laura.

1168
00:58:08.233 --> 00:58:11.800
I was just passionately
conveying an opinion.

1169
00:58:11.934 --> 00:58:13.033
Okay.

1170
00:58:13.166 --> 00:58:14.266
What about?

1171
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.600
I was concerned
about all the rumors

1172
00:58:16.734 --> 00:58:19.033
and gossip about her and
Archie and how it might

1173
00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:20.633
impact the wellness center.

1174
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.266
I can fix bones in a few hours.

1175
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.934
but what Owen does.
it takes longer.

1176
00:58:29.066 --> 00:58:30.467
He fixes lives.

1177
00:58:32.433 --> 00:58:34.266
Did you know that his
mother was an addict?

1178
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.433
I didn't.

1179
00:58:35.567 --> 00:58:36.700
Yeah. he was
gonna be a surgeon.

1180
00:58:36.834 --> 00:58:38.967
but when she died. he
switched to psychiatry.

1181
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.900
The man is on a mission and
I'm doing whatever I can

1182
00:58:43.033 --> 00:58:44.033
to help him.

1183
00:58:45.233 --> 00:58:47.934
As I passionately
conveyed to Laura.

1184
00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:51.734
more people need access to
what her and Owen actually do.

1185
00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:57.533
And I'm living proof of that.

1186
00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:01.333
You're in therapy.

1187
00:59:01.467 --> 00:59:04.934
Yeah.

1188
00:59:05.066 --> 00:59:06.433
Good for you.

1189
00:59:06.567 --> 00:59:09.333
Yeah. well. maybe I
should've done it long ago

1190
00:59:09.467 --> 00:59:10.967
like you wanted me to.

1191
00:59:12.166 --> 00:59:15.166
Things might've turned
out differently.

1192
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.700
Well. how did. um. how did
things turn out with Laura?

1193
00:59:22.834 --> 00:59:24.266
Well. I didn't get a
chance to talk to her

1194
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.867
and she got a call
from a patient.

1195
00:59:28.233 --> 00:59:31.867
Goldy. what is with
all the questions?

1196
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.100
I'm sorry.

1197
00:59:36.233 --> 00:59:40.667
I'm just trying to
understand how my friend...

1198
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.033
Of course.

1199
00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:47.166
Look. I'm sorry.

1200
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.166
You know. the one
thing that I've learned

1201
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:52.700
from all of this therapy is
that life is like a mystery

1202
00:59:52.834 --> 00:59:56.767
and sometimes you just
have to accept that.

1203
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.867
- Shultz.
- Hey. it's Goldy.

1204
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.767
So. my ex-husband did talk
to Laura after the luncheon

1205
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.500
before she got in
her car and left.

1206
01:00:19.633 --> 01:00:20.700
Did he see something?

1207
01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:22.433
No. but he did say
that she received a call

1208
01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:23.700
from a patient.

1209
01:00:23.834 --> 01:00:25.500
Around what time?

1210
01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:27.333
Probably 4:00ish.

1211
01:00:27.467 --> 01:00:28.433
Hey. Mason.

1212
01:00:28.567 --> 01:00:29.433
You're looking at
incoming calls. right?

1213
01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:30.934
Yeah. what do you need?

1214
01:00:31.066 --> 01:00:32.367
Check out a call before
the crash around 4:00.

1215
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.367
Hey. this number.

1216
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.800
It's Julian Geddes' number.

1217
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.333
They talked for just a minute.

1218
01:00:40.467 --> 01:00:41.333
It was Julian.

1219
01:00:41.467 --> 01:00:42.433
They just talked for a minute.

1220
01:00:42.567 --> 01:00:43.500
He was probably
calling her to tell her

1221
01:00:43.633 --> 01:00:44.700
he was coming to
the parking lot.

1222
01:00:44.834 --> 01:00:46.367
She got another call
nine minutes later.

1223
01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:49.000
An unlisted number.

1224
01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:50.533
This call was for 30 minutes.

1225
01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:51.767
- Hang on.
- What?

1226
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.834
- Wait a second.
- What's going on?

1227
01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:57.266
The distance from the school
to where she crashed. it's...

1228
01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:02.567
Tom?

1229
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.233
I think we just figured
out that Laura was on a call

1230
01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:06.333
with somebody when she
went off the cliff.

1231
01:01:06.467 --> 01:01:07.900
With who?

1232
01:01:08.033 --> 01:01:10.333
That's an excellent question.

1233
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.400
And Goldy's going
to ask Brad about

1234
01:01:13.533 --> 01:01:15.400
his relationship with Laura.

1235
01:01:15.533 --> 01:01:17.100
Shouldn't she
be wearing a wire?

1236
01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.667
We're not there yet.

1237
01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.400
They're here.

1238
01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:31.400
I used to have a
major crush on Goldy

1239
01:01:31.533 --> 01:01:32.600
when she was my babysitter.

1240
01:01:32.734 --> 01:01:33.900
Really?

1241
01:01:34.033 --> 01:01:35.233
She used to bring
me delicious treats

1242
01:01:35.367 --> 01:01:36.934
she cooked in mason jars.

1243
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.834
Thought she had the jars
specifically made for me.

1244
01:01:42.967 --> 01:01:46.400
I don't have a crush on her
anymore. for the record.

1245
01:01:46.533 --> 01:01:47.567
Mmm.

1246
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.734
I mean. she's
cool. but. you know.

1247
01:01:50.867 --> 01:01:52.500
Think we'd be a bad fit.

1248
01:01:52.633 --> 01:01:53.834
Oh. yeah.

1249
01:01:53.967 --> 01:01:55.734
Who would date a prep?

1250
01:01:55.867 --> 01:01:57.433
Uh. technically. two.

1251
01:01:57.567 --> 01:02:02.467
Um. I guess it just feels
like one.

1252
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.467
I have to confess.

1253
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.233
I'm a little bit disappointed.

1254
01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:08.467
About what?

1255
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.333
I knew you were
going to Adele's.

1256
01:02:10.467 --> 01:02:12.734
and I was really hoping
to dance with you.

1257
01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:15.633
Well. that could still happen.

1258
01:02:15.767 --> 01:02:17.133
Adele made me promise
that I would at least

1259
01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.000
spend some time as a guest.

1260
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.266
They seem to be
having a nice time.

1261
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.066
Do you think she's into
him or just. you know.

1262
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.333
playing along for
the investigation?

1263
01:02:29.467 --> 01:02:30.567
You know her better than I do.

1264
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.667
Sure.

1265
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:38.400
I think she's playing along.

1266
01:02:38.533 --> 01:02:40.800
He reminds me of Richard.

1267
01:02:40.934 --> 01:02:42.066
He doesn't look
anything like Richard.

1268
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.000
He's good-looking.
slick. well-dressed.

1269
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.400
And wrong for her.

1270
01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:52.633
Yeah.

1271
01:02:57.967 --> 01:03:04.066
Listen. I. um. I have to
ask you an awkward question.

1272
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.467
As Olive has heard
me say a hundred times.

1273
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.233
I have never heard a question
that I didn't appreciate.

1274
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.667
Just ask.

1275
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800
Okay.

1276
01:03:14.834 --> 01:03:16.467
Is there any truth
to the rumor that you

1277
01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.166
and Laura once dated?

1278
01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.967
Oh. no.

1279
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.467
I think I just asked you a
question you didn't appreciate.

1280
01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:30.400
No. it's just
a pathetic story.

1281
01:03:30.533 --> 01:03:31.900
I'll be the judge of that.

1282
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.033
Laura and I met
in Aspen. skiing.

1283
01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:42.200
Cliche. I know. but
we really hit it off.

1284
01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:44.533
We made it work for a
couple years long distance.

1285
01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:47.633
and then she decided she
wanted to move to Elk Park.

1286
01:03:47.767 --> 01:03:50.367
She said she just fell
in love with the place.

1287
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.900
but I thought it
was more than that.

1288
01:03:55.166 --> 01:03:58.967
and I bought a ring.

1289
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.533
which I returned a
couple days later.

1290
01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:08.633
Well. that couldn't
have been easy.

1291
01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:10.100
No.

1292
01:04:10.233 --> 01:04:12.100
And I'm sure it was
even harder when she took

1293
01:04:12.233 --> 01:04:13.533
the school counseling job.

1294
01:04:14.734 --> 01:04:18.800
I handled it.

1295
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.600
Ah.

1296
01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:24.100
Now you owe me a
painful romance story.

1297
01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:28.266
I have one or two of
those stories.

1298
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.533
Well. ante up.

1299
01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:33.266
I. uh. I definitely will.

1300
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.934
I'll be back.

1301
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:44.934
What's going on?

1302
01:04:45.066 --> 01:04:45.967
The autopsy came back.

1303
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.467
The crash didn't kill her.

1304
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.433
She was poisoned.

1305
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.834
The ME said the poison
was water hemlock.

1306
01:05:01.967 --> 01:05:05.033
which apparently grows
all over the place here.

1307
01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:07.200
I'm having forensics test the
chocolate-covered shortbread

1308
01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:08.934
that was in the front
seat of her car.

1309
01:05:09.066 --> 01:05:11.033
Chocolate is a great
masker of flavor.

1310
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.767
Wait a minute. you
don't think that?

1311
01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.000
You're the killer?

1312
01:05:15.133 --> 01:05:16.200
You've been helping me
in the investigation

1313
01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.767
because you wanna get caught?

1314
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.333
No. Okay?

1315
01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:27.500
But there's no question
that there is a killer now.

1316
01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:31.667
And hemlock takes 30
minutes to take effect.

1317
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.100
Laura was on the
phone with someone for-

1318
01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:35.000
30 minutes.

1319
01:05:35.133 --> 01:05:37.266
Yeah. and since nobody
came forward after her death.

1320
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.166
I'm assuming the killer
was on the phone with her-

1321
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.166
To make sure that she died.

1322
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.266
Yeah.

1323
01:05:43.633 --> 01:05:46.367
That is awful.

1324
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.000
Well. Brad. Brad
just admitted to me

1325
01:05:48.133 --> 01:05:52.700
that he proposed to Laura
and she turned him down.

1326
01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:54.166
I mean. he was trying
to joke about it.

1327
01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.433
but it was clearly
still painful to him.

1328
01:05:56.567 --> 01:05:58.867
I mean. do you think that he?

1329
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.900
I have to look into it.

1330
01:06:04.033 --> 01:06:06.400
God.

1331
01:06:06.533 --> 01:06:09.667
You should. you
should probably get
back to your dinner.

1332
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.100
I've lost my appetite.

1333
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.266
I'm so sorry.

1334
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.734
It's Olive. I need to go.

1335
01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:21.100
Okay. let's
get out of here.

1336
01:06:21.233 --> 01:06:22.133
Olive needs you.

1337
01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:23.233
You're just being a great mom.

1338
01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:24.600
But you still owe me a story.

1339
01:06:25.567 --> 01:06:27.667
Tomorrow. while we're dancing.

1340
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.567
That sounds great.

1341
01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.567
Thank you.

1342
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.567
You're welcome.

1343
01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.200
Goodnight.

1344
01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:55.166
I just. I thought
I'd check in on you.

1345
01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.900
Thank you.

1346
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:05.000
I'm actually. um. doing
an impression of you.

1347
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.800
So these are for
the party tomorrow.

1348
01:07:12.934 --> 01:07:16.233
They're not quite as
visual as your board.

1349
01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:17.633
I like what you're
doing here. though.

1350
01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:18.834
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1351
01:07:18.967 --> 01:07:20.433
Well. I'm just
trying to figure out

1352
01:07:20.567 --> 01:07:23.400
who was at the luncheon that
had access to the shortbread.

1353
01:07:23.533 --> 01:07:24.967
All of them?

1354
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.000
When it was on
the buffet. yes.

1355
01:07:27.133 --> 01:07:29.333
but that was in plain sight.

1356
01:07:30.767 --> 01:07:32.300
How about before you brought
them out to the buffet?

1357
01:07:32.433 --> 01:07:36.633
Well. I was in the
kitchen with Brad.

1358
01:07:36.767 --> 01:07:39.900
but we were together
the entire time.

1359
01:07:40.033 --> 01:07:41.300
But then-

1360
01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:42.500
What?

1361
01:07:42.633 --> 01:07:43.967
Well. I just. I went
out into the hall.

1362
01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:48.000
and when I came back. Marla
was in the kitchen alone

1363
01:07:48.133 --> 01:07:50.066
eating the shortbread.

1364
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.834
And she was the one who told
me about Laura and Brad.

1365
01:07:52.967 --> 01:07:56.400
and she was the
one that invited me

1366
01:07:56.533 --> 01:08:01.400
to do this last minute gig
after going out with Archie.

1367
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.734
Going. going out?

1368
01:08:03.867 --> 01:08:04.734
On a date?

1369
01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:06.133
I mean. I don't know.

1370
01:08:06.266 --> 01:08:08.066
They were clearly
flirting at the luncheon.

1371
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.467
Wow.

1372
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.200
But the thing
is. is. I've just.

1373
01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:12.800
I've known Marla for years.

1374
01:08:12.934 --> 01:08:15.400
There's just no way
that she's a killer.

1375
01:08:15.533 --> 01:08:16.633
In my experience.

1376
01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.133
there's always a way

1377
01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:25.867
for anyone of us.

1378
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.033
It's just a matter of things
coming together in a way

1379
01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:35.867
that makes it happen.

1380
01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.400
Take the appetizers
to the staging area.

1381
01:08:58.533 --> 01:08:59.700
Thank you.

1382
01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:02.367
So beautiful.

1383
01:09:06.233 --> 01:09:07.300
Oh.

1384
01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:09.266
You as friendly
with Adele Dennison?

1385
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.367
As friendly as I need to be.

1386
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.467
What about Julian Geddes?

1387
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.967
That's Adele's son.

1388
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.867
Well. I was his teacher
for a couple of years. but...

1389
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.100
And how is he doing now?

1390
01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:31.200
I'm sorry. but that
would be violating

1391
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.633
doctor-patient privileges.

1392
01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:07.533
Mmm.

1393
01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:08.633
Excuse me.

1394
01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:09.767
I'll see you later.

1395
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.266
- Wow. Goldy.
- Yeah?

1396
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.467
We're only in the appetizers.

1397
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.934
and it's already magnificent.

1398
01:10:15.066 --> 01:10:16.533
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1399
01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:20.867
However. I have been
instructed by the hostess

1400
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.633
to ask you to shed
your outerwear.

1401
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.100
Okay.

1402
01:10:28.233 --> 01:10:29.200
She's the boss.

1403
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.433
I'll go stow this.

1404
01:10:32.567 --> 01:10:33.934
No. please. let me.

1405
01:10:34.066 --> 01:10:35.133
I can take it for you.
- Really?

1406
01:10:35.266 --> 01:10:36.533
I actually have
to use the restroom.

1407
01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:39.133
Oh. thank you. thanks.

1408
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.533
Goldy. you look...

1409
01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:46.533
Oh. my.

1410
01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:48.533
You struck Richard dumb. Goldy.

1411
01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:50.266
Is there anything you can't do?

1412
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.266
I don't know. I'm sure Richard
can think of a few things.

1413
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.066
Oh. yeah. you
two are hilarious.

1414
01:10:56.567 --> 01:10:58.633
Owen. the O'Connors
would love to hear more

1415
01:10:58.767 --> 01:10:59.700
about the wellness center.

1416
01:10:59.834 --> 01:11:00.767
Can you?

1417
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.500
Uh. duty calls.

1418
01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.100
Have fun.

1419
01:11:23.066 --> 01:11:28.567
Oh!

1420
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.066
Don't scream.

1421
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.667
It's me.

1422
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.100
I didn't want to scare you.

1423
01:11:35.867 --> 01:11:36.767
Well. you failed!

1424
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.934
I'm sorry!

1425
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.734
And first off. what are
you doing without gloves?

1426
01:11:41.867 --> 01:11:43.433
Put these on. okay?

1427
01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:44.600
You wanna be detective.
you've gotta get better

1428
01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:45.767
at sneaking around.

1429
01:11:48.133 --> 01:11:51.867
This is Adele's desk.

1430
01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.166
Look.

1431
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.567
Clonazepam.

1432
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.633
Isn't that for seizures?

1433
01:12:04.767 --> 01:12:07.000
I worked with a
chef who had them.

1434
01:12:07.133 --> 01:12:08.600
Well. there also for anxiety.

1435
01:12:11.433 --> 01:12:13.166
Looks like he hasn't
taken them in months.

1436
01:12:21.367 --> 01:12:23.667
"Stay away from
my husband or I will

1437
01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.166
end things for you here."

1438
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.633
Maybe she was
talking about getting

1439
01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:32.166
Laura fired from school?

1440
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.300
Yeah. maybe.

1441
01:12:37.433 --> 01:12:39.667
Don't you wanna take that?

1442
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.567
Not until I come back
with a search warrant.

1443
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.000
Oh. yeah. Yes.

1444
01:12:46.767 --> 01:12:48.967
I was. um. starting
to think that you

1445
01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.667
weren't gonna make it.

1446
01:12:53.367 --> 01:13:00.233
Needed to buy a fresh tie.

1447
01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:05.700
You did good.

1448
01:13:14.533 --> 01:13:17.300
Wow.

1449
01:13:17.433 --> 01:13:20.867
You are good at what you do.

1450
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.467
So are you.

1451
01:13:26.834 --> 01:13:30.000
You know. I've been
meaning to ask you.

1452
01:13:30.934 --> 01:13:34.367
What are you doing here?

1453
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.567
In Elk Park. I mean.

1454
01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.467
That's a. that's a
funny story. actually.

1455
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.166
My ex-wife is from here.

1456
01:13:45.433 --> 01:13:46.967
Ex-wife.

1457
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.700
Yup.

1458
01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:52.300
Hmm.

1459
01:13:52.433 --> 01:13:54.300
Yeah. she was always talking
about how much she missed it.

1460
01:13:54.433 --> 01:13:57.200
especially when we were
going through a rough patch.

1461
01:13:57.333 --> 01:14:01.600
which was a good description
of all three years

1462
01:14:01.734 --> 01:14:02.700
of our marriage.

1463
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.433
Oh.

1464
01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:10.533
Anyway. I saw this job
listed and I thought.

1465
01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:12.967
you know. maybe. maybe
that'll be the thing to

1466
01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.266
save our marriage.

1467
01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.700
She served me with
the divorce papers

1468
01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:20.900
on the same day the
job offer came through.

1469
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.867
But you came anyway.

1470
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.133
Yeah. San Francisco
just wasn't the same.

1471
01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:33.767
And I needed a break
from all the crime.

1472
01:14:37.433 --> 01:14:39.100
What was her name?

1473
01:14:39.233 --> 01:14:40.200
Jessamine.

1474
01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:41.367
Jessamine?

1475
01:14:42.233 --> 01:14:44.533
Jessamine Cole?

1476
01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:45.600
You know her?

1477
01:14:45.734 --> 01:14:46.900
Since kindergarten.

1478
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:55.467
I'm surprised you lasted
three years.

1479
01:15:06.233 --> 01:15:09.333
Ladies and gentlemen. will
you please head this way?

1480
01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:10.934
Dinner will be served shortly.

1481
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.934
Owen.

1482
01:15:50.066 --> 01:15:51.367
Goldy.

1483
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.533
What are you doing?

1484
01:15:55.834 --> 01:16:00.600
Hoping not to find something.

1485
01:16:00.734 --> 01:16:02.166
I don't understand.

1486
01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.900
My patient Julian Geddes
lives here. and. uh.

1487
01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:06.233
What?

1488
01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:08.433
I'm afraid Julian has. uh.

1489
01:16:08.567 --> 01:16:11.567
developed an unhealthy fixation.

1490
01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.834
An obsessive attraction.
really. to. uh.

1491
01:16:16.133 --> 01:16:19.433
a mutual friend of ours.

1492
01:16:19.567 --> 01:16:21.667
To Laura?

1493
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.500
She obviously didn't tell you.

1494
01:16:23.633 --> 01:16:26.233
probably trying to
protect him. I'm sure.

1495
01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:29.166
But my concern was that
he might've somehow...

1496
01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.734
Do you know that Julian's
father was killed

1497
01:16:32.867 --> 01:16:34.767
the same way.
driving off a cliff?

1498
01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:38.667
I did. actually.

1499
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.266
I was praying that...

1500
01:16:48.533 --> 01:16:53.000
That's water hemlock.

1501
01:16:53.133 --> 01:16:54.166
The police said it
was in the shortbread

1502
01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.166
that Laura ate before she died.

1503
01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.734
Your shortbread?

1504
01:16:57.867 --> 01:16:59.934
Same recipe. minus the poison.

1505
01:17:03.533 --> 01:17:07.467
I posted the menu online a
week before the luncheon.

1506
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.066
Goldy. Julian was in
the parking lot with Laura

1507
01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.467
that day before she left.

1508
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.467
Do you think-
- What I think

1509
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.600
is that the person who planted
the hemlock in the drawer

1510
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.233
should've gone to the trouble
to look in Julian's kitchen.

1511
01:17:24.367 --> 01:17:27.333
Do you know if this oven works?

1512
01:17:27.467 --> 01:17:29.166
Yeah. we'd get it fixed
if the current tenant

1513
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.400
ever did any cooking.

1514
01:17:33.967 --> 01:17:37.734
Julian couldn't
bake shortbread.

1515
01:17:37.867 --> 01:17:40.400
but I bet your oven
works just fine.

1516
01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:42.967
Hang on.

1517
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.066
You. you think that I-

1518
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.900
Planted the hemlock in the
drawer before I walked in.

1519
01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.066
Yeah. I do.

1520
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.734
But I'm not a detective. so.

1521
01:17:57.867 --> 01:18:01.567
Maybe I'm wrong.

1522
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.033
I'm just gonna run it
by Detective Shultz.

1523
01:18:03.166 --> 01:18:04.133
Wait.

1524
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.066
Goldy!
- What?

1525
01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:16.100
Owen!

1526
01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:25.767
You at the station?

1527
01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.100
No. we're coming to you.

1528
01:18:27.233 --> 01:18:28.533
Mason. we're
about to have dinner.

1529
01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:30.934
We're watching Julian's
surveillance camera.

1530
01:18:31.066 --> 01:18:32.700
Goldy's in trouble!

1531
01:18:35.233 --> 01:18:36.800
He's taking her into the forest.

1532
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.033
Go on. deeper into
the woods. hurry.

1533
01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:41.266
- Okay. just-
- Come on.

1534
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.433
Just let me take
my heels off. okay?

1535
01:18:42.567 --> 01:18:44.700
- Come on.
- I can't walk in them.

1536
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.600
Goldy!

1537
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.266
Goldy!

1538
01:19:24.567 --> 01:19:26.200
Goldy!

1539
01:19:38.667 --> 01:19:39.633
Goldy!

1540
01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:45.266
Goldy!

1541
01:19:50.233 --> 01:19:51.166
Hey.

1542
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.333
Your head! Are you okay?

1543
01:19:52.467 --> 01:19:53.333
Yeah.

1544
01:19:53.467 --> 01:19:54.600
It's Owen.

1545
01:19:54.734 --> 01:19:56.600
He killed Laura and he's
trying to frame Julian.

1546
01:19:59.233 --> 01:20:01.767
Owen. put the gun down.

1547
01:20:03.233 --> 01:20:05.433
Owen. Owen. look
at me. look at me.

1548
01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:06.533
You knew.

1549
01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:08.834
- Hey. Laura.
- Hi.

1550
01:20:08.967 --> 01:20:10.767
Uh. here. For you.

1551
01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:11.767
What is this?

1552
01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.834
I don't know.

1553
01:20:12.967 --> 01:20:14.133
Goldy just...

1554
01:20:14.266 --> 01:20:15.333
You knew if she
started eating right away

1555
01:20:15.467 --> 01:20:16.333
that the hemlock
would hit as she was

1556
01:20:16.467 --> 01:20:18.667
driving up the mountain.

1557
01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.166
And you stayed on
the phone with her

1558
01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.467
just to make sure that
your plan would work.

1559
01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.266
You should've stayed
out of it. Goldy.

1560
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.600
Stayed out of what?

1561
01:20:27.734 --> 01:20:30.100
- I'm trying to help people!
- You killed Laura!

1562
01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.333
No. you don't under.
you don't understand.

1563
01:20:33.467 --> 01:20:34.934
Don't you see?

1564
01:20:35.066 --> 01:20:37.433
The wellness center can help
treat people with addiction.

1565
01:20:37.567 --> 01:20:39.533
Oh. I use it all the
time in my hypnotherapy

1566
01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:41.333
to treat serious addiction.

1567
01:20:41.467 --> 01:20:44.100
Modify behavior. help people
break through limitations

1568
01:20:44.233 --> 01:20:45.433
in their thinking.

1569
01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:47.166
The power of suggestion.

1570
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:51.166
What if Julian was
the inspiration to build

1571
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:52.500
a wellness center?

1572
01:20:52.633 --> 01:20:54.266
His troubles gave
me the inspiration

1573
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.800
to build the wellness center.

1574
01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.834
And what about Julian?

1575
01:20:59.967 --> 01:21:01.400
You were supposed to help him.

1576
01:21:01.533 --> 01:21:04.433
Julian. tell your mother
that the wellness center

1577
01:21:04.567 --> 01:21:08.166
is a wonderful investment.
and to give Archie the money.

1578
01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.266
Yeah. but
then Julian realized

1579
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.834
what he was trying to do.

1580
01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:12.333
Because he stopped
taking his medications.

1581
01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.266
You both think you're
so clever. don't you?

1582
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.166
It wasn't Archie who Laura
was gonna see that night.

1583
01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:20.767
It was Julian. and he
told her what you did.

1584
01:21:22.467 --> 01:21:24.600
And Laura made a complaint
to the state medical board.

1585
01:21:24.734 --> 01:21:26.333
How did you know that?

1586
01:21:26.467 --> 01:21:28.233
You know. the state of
Colorado has strict laws

1587
01:21:28.367 --> 01:21:30.600
against the misuse
of hypnotherapy?

1588
01:21:30.734 --> 01:21:32.066
You're probably gonna
lose your license.

1589
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.066
Answer me!

1590
01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.166
How did you know that?

1591
01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:35.600
So what's your next move?

1592
01:21:37.233 --> 01:21:39.433
You gonna shoot us both?

1593
01:21:39.567 --> 01:21:41.600
Put it on Julian?

1594
01:21:41.734 --> 01:21:43.734
The thing you don't
know is that Julian has

1595
01:21:43.867 --> 01:21:45.734
an alibi right now.

1596
01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:48.133
For the past hour. he's
been with Deputy Kildea.

1597
01:21:48.266 --> 01:21:50.233
No.

1598
01:21:50.367 --> 01:21:53.166
No. you're. you're bluffing.

1599
01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.500
Just like you bluffed Julian

1600
01:21:55.633 --> 01:21:57.834
when you sent him that email
from Laura's work computer.

1601
01:21:57.967 --> 01:22:00.967
You needed people to see
Julian in the school parking lot

1602
01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:05.166
with Laura before she
died because all you did

1603
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.734
was tip Laura off.

1604
01:22:06.867 --> 01:22:09.333
As soon as Julian told her
that she sent him an email.

1605
01:22:09.467 --> 01:22:11.233
Laura suspected that
he was in danger

1606
01:22:11.367 --> 01:22:13.400
and she sent him somewhere safe.

1607
01:22:13.533 --> 01:22:15.900
Julian's got a lot to
share with Deputy Kildea.

1608
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.467
With the thumb drive
Laura gave him.

1609
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.233
with the medical
board complaint.

1610
01:22:22.633 --> 01:22:25.133
and the fact that two
weeks ago Julian installed

1611
01:22:25.266 --> 01:22:27.900
hidden security cameras
in the guest quarters.

1612
01:22:28.033 --> 01:22:30.467
That's how you knew
we were in the woods.

1613
01:22:33.367 --> 01:22:35.500
You're lying. You're lying!

1614
01:22:35.633 --> 01:22:37.400
Owen had to plant
the poison tonight

1615
01:22:37.533 --> 01:22:38.734
so that by the time
the medical examiner

1616
01:22:38.867 --> 01:22:39.934
got back from her conference.

1617
01:22:40.066 --> 01:22:41.734
I'd have reason to
search Julian's room.

1618
01:22:41.867 --> 01:22:43.734
But Owen. I had the ME
come back a day early.

1619
01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:46.500
so we're a few
steps ahead of you.

1620
01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.800
- It's over.
- Don't!

1621
01:22:49.934 --> 01:22:50.800
Hey. hey!

1622
01:22:50.934 --> 01:22:51.800
Owen.

1623
01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:52.800
Don't.

1624
01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:55.734
Don't get any closer. Goldy.

1625
01:22:58.266 --> 01:22:59.967
Owen. look.

1626
01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:04.633
I know. I know that you
just wanna help people.

1627
01:23:04.767 --> 01:23:08.000
and the wellness center.
it is such a great cause.

1628
01:23:09.867 --> 01:23:12.200
But Owen.

1629
01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:15.200
your mother. she. she
wouldn't want this.

1630
01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:17.700
Did you know that his
mother was an addict?

1631
01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.200
I could've helped
so many people.

1632
01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:24.300
I know.

1633
01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:25.467
Detective! Goldy!

1634
01:23:31.567 --> 01:23:33.200
Hey.

1635
01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:35.900
Hey.

1636
01:23:36.033 --> 01:23:39.033
Take him away.

1637
01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:46.633
You have the
right to remain silent.

1638
01:23:46.767 --> 01:23:49.066
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1639
01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.066
in the court of law.

1640
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.633
I was closer.

1641
01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.367
You're good.

1642
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.200
Yeah.

1643
01:24:03.767 --> 01:24:06.200
Hey. doin' all right?

1644
01:24:17.066 --> 01:24:20.433
So you. like. you
like disarmed him?

1645
01:24:20.567 --> 01:24:22.133
Well.

1646
01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:24.367
I tackled him.

1647
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.100
You're like the
coolest person I know.

1648
01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:29.867
and that even includes
Detective Shultz.

1649
01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:37.200
Mason.

1650
01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:41.967
I'm gonna head
to the station now.

1651
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.767
Well. I hate to be uncool.

1652
01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.867
but I gotta head there as well.

1653
01:24:50.433 --> 01:24:52.533
Got a long night of
paperwork ahead of me.

1654
01:24:54.767 --> 01:24:56.100
I'm gonna need you to come
to the station tomorrow.

1655
01:24:56.233 --> 01:24:57.700
Is that okay?

1656
01:24:57.834 --> 01:24:59.467
- Of course.

1657

01:25:15.467 --> 01:25:18.000

1660
01:25:18.133 --> 01:25:21.000
Well.
