[client]<i> I need money</i>

00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:45.680

12
00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:54.191
<i>I want to get</i>

13
00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:55.557
<i>like. uh. the--</i>
<i>The Laughing Hut.</i>

14
00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.363
[Lenny]<i> Yes. I could</i>
<i>totally see you there.</i>

15
00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:59.025
[client]<i> And can you-- can you</i>
<i>get me into these places?</i>

16
00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:00.428
[Lenny]<i> Yeah. I can get you</i>
<i>into all those places. buddy.</i>

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.035
-<i> Yes.</i>
- [client]<i> Yeah. like. I need--</i>

18
00:01:02.137 --> 00:01:03.633
<i>But I need that</i>
<i>to happen. like. now.</i>

19
00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:05.204
<i>I need something to happen</i>
<i>finally. you know what I mean?</i>

20
00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:07.104
- [Lenny]<i> Yes!</i>
- [client]<i> Okay. so let's go.</i>

21
00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:09.140
- Make it happen.
- Hey. I get it.

22
00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:12.309
Look. fame. fortune.
that's everything

23
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:14.343
and don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

24
00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.677
because without that.
you're nobody.

25
00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:20.684
But you can't do it alone.
It takes two to tango.

26
00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:23.988
Okay. I feel like
you're not listening to me
or hearing me at all.

27
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:25.422
No. I hear you.
You're in a rut.

28
00:01:25.524 --> 00:01:27.456
You're not booking.
You wanna make some changes.

29
00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:30.296
So. we'll find a new agent.
new manager.

30
00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:32.132
and. you know. maybe
you could shake things up too.

31
00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.199
Like. work a dummy
into your act or something.

32
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:36.167
I hear ventriloquism
is making a comeback.

33
00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:38.235
It's not. I don't know
who told you that.

34
00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:40.441
- People. and it is.
- No. it is not.

35
00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:41.469
Yes. it is.

36
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:43.542
Find a puppet
that looks like you.

37
00:01:43.644 --> 00:01:44.777
[laughs]

38
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:45.945
I can see it right now.

39
00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:48.012
- [laughs]
- That's not a thing.

40
00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:49.445
- It is a thing.
- No. it's not.

41
00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:50.915
- It's a great thing.
- What are you talk--

42
00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:52.081
What is this? What is this--

43
00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:53.314
this puppet suggestion?

44
00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:55.250
Look. it's been months. okay?

45
00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:56.416
And you've brought me nothing.

46
00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:58.188
Nobody. No agents.
no managers.

47
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.157
You've introduced me
to zero people.

48
00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.061
Well. it takes time.
[chuckles]

49
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:03.695
Yeah. I'm not sure
I even know what you do.

50
00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:05.265
What do you do?

51
00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:08.434
What do you mean "what"?
I do it all. I'm your guy.

52
00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.568
You said you're a publicist.
but you don't even
have a website.

53
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.331
- There's no
phone number to call.
- No. I am. I am.

54
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.667
Oh. excuse me. uh...

55
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.504
- Are you a publicist?
- Yes. Eight dollars?

56
00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:18.212
- You are?
You're a real publicist?
- Yes.

57
00:02:18.314 --> 00:02:20.808
- You have other clients?
- Excuse me. I'm counting.

58
00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:22.612
One...

59
00:02:23.552 --> 00:02:24.311
Two...

60
00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:27.551
[distant siren blaring]

61
00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:31.450
- Three.
- I'm letting you go.

62
00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:32.584
- I'm moving on.
- What?

63
00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:35.527
- You're fired.
- What about us?

64
00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.256
- What about our relationship?
- "Us"? What does that mean?

65
00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:39.197
- What about the tip
that you promised?
- There is no us. The tip?

66
00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.263
There is no us.
You care about yourself.

67
00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:42.497
You don't care
about me at all.

68
00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.034
That is not true.
No. I think of both.

69
00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:47.373
I need you.

70
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:49.375
I don't need you.

71
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.507
Fine! Rip my heart out.
why don't you?

72
00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.908
No. I don't need you. anyway.

73
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.977
I'll find somebody better.
Just you wait and see.

74
00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.681
- I'll find myself
a real somebody.
- [door closes]

75
00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:04.321
[doctor 1] The patient.
essentially. is nobody.

76
00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:07.756
- No family. no friends.
- [doctor 2] Hmm.

77
00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:11.793
His condition is quite frankly
bizarre. to say the least.

78
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.496
He has the mind of a--
a five-year-old.

79
00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:19.773
or say. um.
a Labrador retriever.

80
00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.240
Understanding very little

81
00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:24.242
and allowing himself
to be quite easily led.

82
00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:27.875
Observe. Patient.
would you stand up?

83
00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.848
Stand up. Yeah. up. up.

84
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.583
Yeah. Perfect.

85
00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:34.849
How about you. uh. maybe
put your hand on your head?

86
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:37.350
Can you do that for me? Yeah.
put your hand on your head.

87
00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:39.026
On your head. Yep.

88
00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:41.755
Now your nose.
your finger on your nose.

89
00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:45.396
Yeah. yeah. Right.
How about your chin? Do that?

90
00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:47.664
How about for your--
Can you find your ear?

91
00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:50.738
Yeah. Great. Have a seat.

92
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.606
You can have a seat now.

93
00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:54.368
Have a seat.

94
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.573
No. no. Sit. You're done.

95
00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:58.904
Here you go. just sit down.
Yeah. you're good.

96
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:01.311
You're good. We're done.
No. no. you did great.

97
00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:04.683
You did wonderfully.
Good job.

98
00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:07.821
- See? It's...
- What do you think it is?

99
00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:09.418
Age regression. perhaps?

100
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.652
We do think
it is that. in part.

101
00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:14.391
possibly caused
by some severe trauma.

102
00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:16.394
the loss of a loved one.
It's hard to say.

103
00:04:16.496 --> 00:04:18.596
The patient has lost
the ability to speak.

104
00:04:18.698 --> 00:04:21.198
- [doctor 2] Oh. I see.
- [doctor 1] He's not deaf

105
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.234
and he's technically not mute.

106
00:04:23.336 --> 00:04:25.171
His case is medically
undefinable.

107
00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:26.566
[doctor 2]
Is his condition reversible?

108
00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:28.040
[clicks tongue] Mm. you know.

109
00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.373
with a proper amount of care

110
00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:32.112
and. uh. a lot
of exposure therapy

111
00:04:32.214 --> 00:04:34.809
and neurophysical
cognitive therapy.

112
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:39.180
and if he were to have
one meaningful connection.

113
00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:43.223
yes. it's possible
that he could regain
his understanding of the world.

114
00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.552
his ability to speak.
his-- his emotions.

115
00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:49.162
- Fascinating.
- Hmm.

116
00:04:49.264 --> 00:04:51.363
So. what's our first course
of action?

117
00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:53.664
Well. the state is not gonna pay
for any of that.

118
00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.932
so we are gonna put his ass
on the first bus downtown.

119
00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:04.037
[bright upbeat music playing]

120
00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:20.427
Hey. Don. it's Lenny!

121
00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:24.691
You don't even know
why I'm calling you. buddy.

122
00:05:25.227 --> 00:05:28.730
Okay. that. yeah. that is why
I'm calling you. But listen.

123
00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:31.001
No. I'm just talking
about representation.

124
00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:32.599
Hello? Oh. man.

125
00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:35.470
Geez. Louise. Geez. Louise!

126
00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:37.807
[both struggling. grunting]

127
00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:44.246
[train whooshing]

128
00:05:44.348 --> 00:05:46.612
[train horn blaring]

129
00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:48.548
Mikey. Mikey. please.

130
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.056
I just-- I'm begging you.

131
00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:54.126
I just-- I need a client.

132
00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:55.523
No. you're getting personal.

133
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.597
I am a real publicist. Mikey.

134
00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.294
No. I get people things.

135
00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:01.633
[children laughing]

136
00:06:04.137 --> 00:06:07.773
[whistle blowing]

137
00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:09.042
[laughing]

138
00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:11.709
[bright upbeat music continues]

139
00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:16.010
[cheering]

140
00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:19.585
What? Are you kidding?

141
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.984
[groans] No!

142
00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:25.454
God! Ugh!

143
00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.791
[bright upbeat music continues]

144
00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:34.534
Hi. Armando.

145
00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:37.771
Yeah. How you doin'. buddy?

146
00:06:37.873 --> 00:06:39.803
Oh. Oh. shoot.

147
00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:42.509
Hold on. let me call you back.

148
00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:45.809
[Lenny grumbling]

149
00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:52.816
[people chattering]

150
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:07.765
[soft music playing]

151
00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:19.639
Hey. it's Lenny
from Starmaker Publicity.

152
00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:23.109
I'm sorry. I just don't see
your name on the list.

153
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:25.413
Um. which film production
are you with again?

154
00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:26.782
I'm with the. um...

155
00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.850
Um. you know me.
I'm a big-time publicist. so...

156
00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.589
- You said that.
- I mean. well. you know.

157
00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:33.591
I'm not some bozo
that. um. you know. just...

158
00:07:33.693 --> 00:07:37.660
I-- I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I don't. um...

159
00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:40.063
Okay. look.
I can give you some money.

160
00:07:40.165 --> 00:07:43.032
I mean. just a little bit.
I mean. not now.
but down the line.

161
00:07:43.134 --> 00:07:46.768
Look. I find the right client.
I cut you in on the profits.

162
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.970
Bing. bang. boom.
We're somebodies.

163
00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:50.871
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

164
00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:52.675
Okay. well. wait.
wait. wait. Okay.

165
00:07:52.777 --> 00:07:54.642
I'll give you
five dollars. Please.

Just let me on the lot. please.

We've been shooting
second unit stuff.

211
00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:13.912

- but he said he'd be back.
- Is he sober?

215

Yeah. make an announcement

237
00:11:22.217 --> 00:11:25.258
It's Sir Billy the Kid
from now on.

238
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.758
Listen to me. fuckface.

239
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.158
You're either a Sir
and an actor from England.

240
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.396
or you're Billy the fucking Kid.
but you can't be both.

241
00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:33.699
[speaking gibberish]

242
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:35.964
No. I'm done. I'm done.
I'm sick of this shit.

243
00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:38.298

What about him?

247
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:47.943
He's a dead ringer for you.

248
00:11:48.045 --> 00:11:49.274
This man don't look
nothin' like me.

249
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.747
I mean. look at him.
He's too short.

250
00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:52.145
He's the exact
same height as you.

251
00:11:52.247 --> 00:11:53.817
He's just not wearing
lifts like you do!

252
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.149
Hey. now you listen
to me. all right?

253

00:11:57.087 --> 00:11:58.757
You know what? I'm done.
I'm fuckin' done.

255
00:11:58.859 --> 00:12:00.222
I probably don't even know
what a lift is

256
00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:01.627
- 'cause they haven't
been invented yet.
- Stop.

257
00:12:01.729 --> 00:12:04.059
- Stop the shit.
- Stop and cut the shit.

258
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:05.662
Don't think I'm not gonna
take him into makeup

259
00:12:05.765 --> 00:12:07.265
so he can finish
the day for you.

260
00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.936

- Oh. my God...

269
00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:28.149

You're actually
way more attractive.

I would agree with that.
actually. The bone structure.

274
00:12:34.896 --> 00:12:36.488
But I don't see it at all.
I don't see it all.

275
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.390
- You are always so negative.
- You're crazy.

276
00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:40.195
Would you help instead
of hurting things?

277
00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:42.429
- I just-- Over here.
- Is this your first time?

278

All right. just be yourself now.
Be yourself. Come on.

337
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.856
Just connect your emotions with
the suffering of the streets.

338
00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.292
[breathes deeply]
Feel me? Hmm?

339
00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:23.993
I'm gonna come at you hard. bro.
I'm gonna come at you real hard.

340
00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:26.594
Stay on the box.
Right here. Good.

341
00:15:27.063 --> 00:15:28.400
Come on. let's spin 'em.

342
00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:31.397
32-A. take one.

343
00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:33.471
- [Chad grunts]
- [Tony] All right.

344
00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:36.067
And... action.

345
00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:39.874
You think you can mess
with my girl. Billy?

346
00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:41.110
You get him. Bart.

347
00:15:41.212 --> 00:15:43.178
He's a cheatin'
sack of shit as it is.

348
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.816
You think you're fast.
but I'm faster.

349
00:15:45.918 --> 00:15:48.885
You wanna get to know my blade?

350
00:15:48.987 --> 00:15:50.717
You wanna get to know my blade?

351
00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:53.323
- He's looking right
into camera.
- Just keep rolling.

352
00:15:53.425 --> 00:15:56.794
You wanna-- You wanna
get to know my blade? You wanna?

353
00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:58.661
Do you want-- What is the line?

354
00:15:58.763 --> 00:16:01.695
- "And you will know the other."
- [spits] I don't need
the line reading.

355
00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:04.231
- Also. it's a stupid line.
- Just say the goddamn line.

356
00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.665
- will ya?
- It's a terrible line.

357
00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.302
The line is terrible. okay?
I don't wanna say it.

358
00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:09.372
I'll say it for you
if you can't figure out how.

359
00:16:09.474 --> 00:16:11.277
- No. I know how to say it.
- Talkin' about your gun.

360
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.640
- No. I know what... [mumbling]
- In case you didn't
read the script.

361
00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:15.944
- Maybe you should go home...
- [Tony] Try not looking

362
00:16:16.046 --> 00:16:17.914
at the camera on this one?

363
00:16:18.016 --> 00:16:19.412
- Yeah. you.
- Terrible line.

364
00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:21.486
- Come over here. Step...
- Marker.

365
00:16:21.588 --> 00:16:23.619
And. action.

366
00:16:23.722 --> 00:16:26.692
- [Chad] You think
you can mess...
- [Tony] Right into camera.

367
00:16:26.794 --> 00:16:28.226
It's his first time doing this.

368
00:16:28.328 --> 00:16:30.124
[Christiana] He's a cheatin'
sack of shit as it is.

369
00:16:30.226 --> 00:16:32.426
Over there. Over there. There.

370
00:16:32.528 --> 00:16:34.359
All right. Can we--
Can I just go back?

371
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.932
[Tony] Put him back on the box.

372
00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:38.602
- Take three.
- And. action.

373
00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:40.804
[Chad grunting]

374
00:16:40.906 --> 00:16:42.372
- There we go.
- Four.

375
00:16:42.474 --> 00:16:44.068
- [Tony] Action!
- I'm feelin' good now.
Feelin' good.

376
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:46.906
- Can I just go back?
- [Tony] Yes. Uh. take it
from the top.

377
00:16:47.008 --> 00:16:48.178
Take five.

378
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.243
You gonna step in line
and get the blade.

379
00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:53.383
or you gonna get the...

380
00:16:53.485 --> 00:16:56.355
- What-- what is the line?
- Just the word "other"!

381
00:16:56.457 --> 00:16:57.952
[sighs]

382
00:16:58.054 --> 00:16:59.184
[Chad] The other.

383
00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:00.693
- Oh.
- Twenty.

384
00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:01.992
- [Tony] Action.
- You think

385
00:17:02.094 --> 00:17:03.958
you can mess
with my girl. Billy?

386
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.495
You get him. Bart.

387
00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:07.792
- [Chad] Hmm?
- He's a lyin' sack
of shit as it is.

388
00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:10.932
- Cut his tiny little balls off.
- Oh. shut up. you.

389
00:17:11.034 --> 00:17:12.302
Hey. don't improv.

390
00:17:12.404 --> 00:17:14.438
- You don't improv.
- How many fucking times?

391
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.170
We're over lunch by an hour.
All these extras
are in pain and...

392
00:17:17.272 --> 00:17:19.210
[Tony] Rolling. Action.

393
00:17:19.312 --> 00:17:23.815
Now. you should step in line
and get the blade...

394
00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.317
[tense quirky music playing]

395
00:17:32.058 --> 00:17:34.622
- The other.
- I hate you. Billy!

396
00:17:36.225 --> 00:17:38.959
- [yells]
- Bang. and cut!

397
00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:40.760
[buzzer blaring]

398
00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:43.128
[Chad] Hey. hey. hey.

399
00:17:43.998 --> 00:17:46.131
- You gotta breathe.
- [Tony] We're going
to go again.

400
00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.734
Latte. pronto.

401
00:17:49.478 --> 00:17:50.510
Good work.

402
00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.812
Excuse me. Mr. Pronto.
I'm a publicist for the. um...

403
00:17:54.914 --> 00:17:56.346
Can I call you Latte?

404
00:17:56.448 --> 00:17:58.610
- Is that your name?
- Oh. my God. I love that name.

405
00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:00.352
- Amazing. You are.
- I had no idea!

406
00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:02.848
A lot of big stars are going
by inanimate objects these days.

407
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.892
Stepping in. Uh. we're
at lunch. folks. That's lunch.

408
00:18:05.994 --> 00:18:07.323
- Oh. thank you. Yeah. yeah.
- Aww.

409
00:18:07.426 --> 00:18:09.455
I'm gonna take Latte Pronto
if you need us.

410
00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:11.524
- [chuckles]
- I'm sorry. Who?

411
00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.999
Oh. oh. no. it's.
uh. Latte Pronto.

412
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:15.795
He's the star of--
Yeah. Latte Pronto.

413
00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:18.099
- Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry.
Mr. Pronto.
- Oh. [stammers]

414
00:18:18.201 --> 00:18:19.201
I will write that down.

415
00:18:19.303 --> 00:18:20.501
- Oh. that's okay.
- It's okay.

416
00:18:20.603 --> 00:18:21.975
You're doing great.
you're doing awesome.

417
00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:23.840
- So sweet.
- No. you guys are so sweet.

418
00:18:23.942 --> 00:18:26.477
Are you kidding me?
You've just been so great
in expediting everything.

419
00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:28.573
- Thank you. Okay.
I'm so sorry again.
- Oh. it's okay.

420
00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:30.082
All right. see you
guys at lunch.

421
00:18:30.184 --> 00:18:31.280
- We'll be on the lot.
- See you at lunch.

422
00:18:31.382 --> 00:18:32.477
- Absolutely. thank you.
- See you there.

423
00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:33.778
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

424
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.419
- She's disgusting.
- She is the absolute

425
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:36.648
- worst person on this Earth.
- I can't stand her.

426
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.186
Are you kidding me?
"It's time for lunch."

427
00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:40.524
[Lenny laughing] Right here.

428
00:18:40.626 --> 00:18:41.823
Hmm.

429
00:18:41.925 --> 00:18:44.857
Mm...

430
00:18:45.898 --> 00:18:47.926
Wow. Latte Pronto.

431
00:18:48.028 --> 00:18:50.763
You and me are gonna do
big things. pal. I can feel it.

432
00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:52.667
Look. that guy's the head
of the studio over there.

433
00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:55.140
All his teeth are fake.
by the way. I'll say hi later.

434
00:18:55.242 --> 00:18:57.108
Oh. see her? The one
who looks like a model?

435
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.443
Don't look. She's actually
a prostitute.

436
00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:02.245
- Hi.
- Hi. Let's do two
of the salmon salads--

437
00:19:02.347 --> 00:19:03.777
Hold the salmon
'cause of the mercury.

438
00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:06.385
No cheese or fatty nuts
of any kind on there. please.

439
00:19:06.487 --> 00:19:09.248
Oh. balsamic on the side--
Actually. scratch that.
No dressing.

440
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.018
just the lettuce rinsed
thoroughly with Evian water.
we're gonna split that.

441
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.453
Oh. and five energy drinks.
You want any?
Oh. and take this away.

442
00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:16.160
What. are you
trying to kill us?

443
00:19:16.262 --> 00:19:18.163
Who still serves bread
at a restaurant?

444
00:19:18.265 --> 00:19:19.561
Might as well feed us
a pack of cigarettes.

445
00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:21.100
- You don't smoke. do you?
- [cell phone ringing]

446
00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:24.297
Well. hang on.
That's the production. Hello?

447
00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:26.671
Yeah. I'm with Mr. Pronto.

448
00:19:26.773 --> 00:19:27.801
Wait. what?

449
00:19:29.107 --> 00:19:32.212
Slow down. What? What?

450
00:19:32.943 --> 00:19:33.972
Okay.

451
00:19:34.914 --> 00:19:36.883
I'll let him know.

452
00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:39.315
- [cell phone thuds]
- [sighs]

453
00:19:39.417 --> 00:19:41.579
Great news. Latte. Sir
Bingsley's dead.

454
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.152
As some of you may have heard.

455
00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:46.622
Sir Thomas Kit Bingsley

456
00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:49.257
died a few hours ago.

457
00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:50.763
- [murmuring]
- [woman] Died?

458
00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:52.161
[man] Who? What? How is...

459
00:19:52.263 --> 00:19:53.327
Of course. there's gonna be

460
00:19:53.429 --> 00:19:56.031
a complete autopsy eventually.

461
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.797
<i>but it appears</i>
<i>that he asphyxiated himself.</i>

462
00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:02.373
presumably while trying
to find some truth

463
00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:05.740
for the big hanging scene
we're shooting tomorrow.

464
00:20:08.314 --> 00:20:11.515
The asphyxiation
may also have been...

465
00:20:13.184 --> 00:20:15.087
autoerotic in nature.

466
00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:16.685
- [all exclaiming]
- Now. that makes sense.

467
00:20:16.787 --> 00:20:20.722
We. we-- we don't know and--
and it's all very unclear.

468
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.296
Uh. but I think it was.

469
00:20:25.428 --> 00:20:26.727
- Wow.
- Well. that was stupid.

470
00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:30.068
Now. I'd like to take
a moment to speak towards

471
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.904
what-- what Tommy
would've wanted.

472
00:20:33.006 --> 00:20:35.207
He. of course. would say.

473
00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:38.307
"Let's stop filming.
can the entire movie."

474
00:20:38.409 --> 00:20:40.278
- What? That's crazy.
- Yeah.

475
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.208
No. no. we gave it a go.
You know. we tried.

476
00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:46.847
But you all know
and would agree.

477
00:20:48.154 --> 00:20:49.722
Tommy was a fuckin' asshole.

478
00:20:49.824 --> 00:20:50.883
- Yes.
- Well...

479
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:52.722
- Yeah. he was.
- He was a bit of an asshole.

480
00:20:52.824 --> 00:20:55.754
- [all chattering]
- That's the long
and short of it.

481
00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.427
But we're gonna
finish this movie

482
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:59.357
and we're gonna finish it
with that guy.

483
00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:01.961
[all chattering]

484
00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:05.734
- [man] Oh. shit.
- Oh. fuck.

485
00:21:06.741 --> 00:21:09.474
[laughing]

486
00:21:09.576 --> 00:21:11.773
Got no time to lose.
Can't let them
change their minds.

487
00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:14.946
This is big time.
Move outta the way.
Move. move!

488
00:21:15.048 --> 00:21:16.248
Stars coming through.

489
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.214
Hey. Latte. Welcome.
Welcome to your team.

490
00:21:19.316 --> 00:21:20.649
You got me. your agent.

491
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:23.189
I'll handle all incoming calls.
I take ten percent.

492
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:25.454
Got your manager.
He'll manage affairs.

493
00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:27.860
Ten percent also.
It's industry standard.

494
00:21:27.962 --> 00:21:28.986
Got your business manager.

495
00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:31.497
He'll manage business affairs.
Five percent.

496
00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:34.259
Got your lawyer.

Five percent too.

497

Got your publicist.
you know him.
we'll put him on a weekly.

498
00:21:37.202 --> 00:21:38.435
Stylist. Weekly. also.

499
00:21:38.537 --> 00:21:40.940
We got a personal assistant.
She's hourly.

500
00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:42.408
Plus. we got you an intern.

501
00:21:43.538 --> 00:21:45.039
Good news is he's free.

502
00:21:45.775 --> 00:21:48.375
- [whispering indistinctly]
- Really? Hmm.

503
00:21:48.477 --> 00:21:52.047
Well. I guess there's a law
against that now.
so you'll have to pay him too.

504
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:53.551
[Lenny] Ah.

505
00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:58.286
Ah. Latte. Who's got
your back. huh?

506
00:21:58.388 --> 00:22:01.391
You know. the studio was gonna
stick you in some hotel
or apartment somewhere.

507
00:22:01.493 --> 00:22:03.092
but I talked
some sense into them.

508
00:22:03.194 --> 00:22:04.956
Look at this spot.

509
00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:07.565
It's perfect for you.
Latte. Think about it.

510
00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:10.562
You can look over the streets
you once begged on.

511
00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:12.834
Latte Pronto killing it.

512
00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:17.509
- [distant sirens blaring]
- [insects trilling]

513
00:22:23.314 --> 00:22:26.914
[floorboards creaking]

514
00:22:35.391 --> 00:22:37.628
[soft music playing]

515
00:23:01.649 --> 00:23:03.549
[soft music continues]

516
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:05.854
[distant siren blaring]

517
00:23:26.812 --> 00:23:28.777
[Lenny] Latte! What. are you
trying to sleep out here?

518
00:23:28.879 --> 00:23:31.511
What are you looking for?
Drugs? That's no good.

519
00:23:31.613 --> 00:23:35.221
Look. I can get you some
if you need it. but we can't
have that in the papers.

520
00:23:35.323 --> 00:23:36.848
No. I've been
following you all night.

521
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.455
I was parked
outside your house.

522
00:23:38.557 --> 00:23:39.586
waiting to take you
to set tomorrow.

523
00:23:39.688 --> 00:23:41.321
but enough is enough. buddy.

524
00:23:41.423 --> 00:23:44.023
Gosh. you gotta be
on set in two hours.
You're gonna be exhausted.

525
00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:46.464
I mean. I like a good walk
as much as anybody.

526
00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:47.962
but let's not make a habit
out of this. okay?

527
00:23:48.064 --> 00:23:49.798
- Walking around the street?
- Walking around outside?

528
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.765
- The streets of LA?
- You could've been mugged.

529
00:23:51.867 --> 00:23:53.271
That's insane.
Nobody walks in LA.

530
00:23:53.373 --> 00:23:54.604
Have the studio
call a car for you.

531
00:23:54.707 --> 00:23:56.135
- Are you serious right now?
- [overlapping]

532
00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:58.737
Looking really-- it's looking
blotchy on this side.

533
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.138
- On this side...
- Wake up.

534
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.711
- Oh. my God. this is insane.
- [knock on door]

535
00:24:01.813 --> 00:24:03.349
Oh. I'm sorry. are you
knocking on the door again?

536
00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:05.309
- Wow. wow.
- He just got in the chair!

537
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:08.317
I need you not to rush me.
all right? Where is the wig?

538
00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:10.182
[Tony] Cameras rolling.

539
00:24:11.155 --> 00:24:12.423
Action.

540
00:24:12.525 --> 00:24:13.884
[Christiana]
Don't leave me. Billy.

541
00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:17.561
You leave me. Billy.
I swear to God.
I'll blow my brains out.

542
00:24:17.663 --> 00:24:20.526
Christ. He can barely
keep his eyes open.

543
00:24:20.628 --> 00:24:21.966
Just keep rolling.

544
00:24:22.068 --> 00:24:24.166
Latte. Open.

545
00:24:24.268 --> 00:24:26.872
Open. Eyes open.

546
00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:28.104
I mean it. Bill.

547
00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:30.973
What does that other girl
have on me. huh?

548
00:24:31.742 --> 00:24:34.211
Is it the tobacco?
'Cause I can quit that.

549
00:24:34.313 --> 00:24:35.546
[Tony] Why is he smiling?

550
00:24:35.649 --> 00:24:36.811
There's nothing
in the script about smiling.

551
00:24:36.913 --> 00:24:38.813
I-- I know there's nothing
in the script.

552
00:24:38.915 --> 00:24:40.979
Look. he's about to leave
his wife. right?

553
00:24:41.081 --> 00:24:43.487
And I can't have him
smiling! [grunts]

554
00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:46.886
Latte. Latte. no.
No. no smiling.

555
00:24:46.988 --> 00:24:49.788
The script says.
"Look sorrowful." so...

556
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.830
[producer] Just do nothing!

557
00:24:51.933 --> 00:24:54.266
It doesn't say do nothing.
It actually says.
"Look sorrowful."

558
00:24:54.368 --> 00:24:56.733
- if you have the sides.
- Elaine?

559
00:24:56.835 --> 00:24:58.367
- I'm just gonna...
- [Tony sighs] Oh. God...

560
00:24:58.469 --> 00:25:00.801
Bill. is it my clothes?

561
00:25:00.903 --> 00:25:03.503
My hair? Is it the fact
that we's cousins?

562
00:25:03.605 --> 00:25:05.673
He's blinking now.

563
00:25:05.775 --> 00:25:08.311
Look at... [sighs]
Look at her.

564
00:25:08.413 --> 00:25:10.015
Look. look. look at her.

565
00:25:10.718 --> 00:25:14.620
Her. Yeah. yeah. look at the--
the pretty dirty lady.

566
00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:16.522
Yes!

567
00:25:16.624 --> 00:25:19.658
Have it your way. Billy.
I hate your guts. anyway.

568
00:25:22.463 --> 00:25:25.392
Now she's doing it.
Oh. Jesus Christ.

569
00:25:25.494 --> 00:25:26.761
[sighs] Cut!

570
00:25:26.863 --> 00:25:28.968
- [buzzer blaring]
- [Tony] Moving on.

571
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.398
I think we got it.

572
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.962
[people chattering]

573
00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:33.772
Are you ready
for this next bit?

574
00:25:33.874 --> 00:25:35.901
I'm gonna come at you hard. bro.
You better start stretchin'.

575
00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:38.108
Stretch 'em out now.
Stretch 'em out.

576
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.337
[Chad grunts]

577
00:25:42.578 --> 00:25:44.848
[grunts] Fuck. Ugh.

578
00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:47.950
[snoring]

579
00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:53.156
That's what you get.

580
00:25:53.258 --> 00:25:54.490
[spits] Dumbass.

581
00:25:54.592 --> 00:25:56.821
[tense dramatic music playing]

582
00:25:56.923 --> 00:25:58.323
[Chad] How did that feel?

583
00:26:00.596 --> 00:26:04.869
I'm gonna kill you.
Billy. you no good.
woman-stealing sack of shit.

584
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:06.701
Hmm?

585
00:26:06.803 --> 00:26:08.670
- Yeah. that's it!
- More pain.

586
00:26:08.772 --> 00:26:10.539
- Harder! Harder!
- More pain!

587
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:13.041
Come on. now.
get on up there.

588
00:26:13.574 --> 00:26:14.476
Yeah.

589
00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:17.181
Yes. yes.
it's great. Yes!

590
00:26:17.283 --> 00:26:19.915
Yeah. Messin' around

591
00:26:20.017 --> 00:26:22.685
- with another man's wife.
- [Tony] Excellent!

592
00:26:22.787 --> 00:26:24.256
- More struggle.
- [Chad] There's rules.

593
00:26:24.358 --> 00:26:26.288
There are rules to this. Billy.

594
00:26:26.924 --> 00:26:29.022
- You gonna pay the price now.
- More pain!

595
00:26:29.124 --> 00:26:31.492
- More pain. it hurts!
- [Chad grunting]

596
00:26:32.027 --> 00:26:34.628
Nice. huh? That's nice
and tight. huh?

597
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.567
Yeah. Now. how that feel?

598
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:39.001
- That's it. Perfect.
- [Tony laughs]

599
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:42.541
Can I get you a coffee. sir?

600
00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:45.007
Or did you wanna sit?
Let me get you a chair.

601
00:26:45.972 --> 00:26:47.412
Hey. bud. How you feelin'?

602
00:26:47.514 --> 00:26:49.114
Whoa. whoa. wait.
Hey. hey. hey.

603
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:50.749
Whoa. hey. hey. hey.

604
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.382
You were good.
You were good.
I felt the fear.

605
00:26:54.484 --> 00:26:55.580
It was palpable.

606
00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:59.719
Yeah. I go half method
these days. yeah. [chuckles]

607
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:00.988
Used to go full method.

608
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.192
But. uh. you know.
some people got hurt.

609
00:27:03.294 --> 00:27:04.997
Not me.

610
00:27:05.099 --> 00:27:05.858
[clears throat]

611
00:27:05.961 --> 00:27:07.832
Kinda like Tommy.
you know.

612
00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:10.868
Couldn't handle it.

613
00:27:12.639 --> 00:27:14.407
Amazing how much
you look like him. huh?

614
00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:16.472
It's like. it's
truly remarkable.

615
00:27:16.574 --> 00:27:17.872
[chuckles] It's uncanny.

616
00:27:17.974 --> 00:27:19.171
Can I get you guys
some chairs. or--

617
00:27:19.273 --> 00:27:20.978
No. no. no.
We're good.
We're good.

618
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:26.611
Hey. I just want to tell you
that I dig what you're doing.

619
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.856
Really. I just think.
like. words are overrated.

620
00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:34.585
You know? They're such
crutches for us as actors.

621
00:27:34.687 --> 00:27:37.560
- Can I get you guys
some chairs?
- No. We're standing.

622
00:27:38.296 --> 00:27:41.498
You know. Spielberg said
that you should be able
to watch a movie

623
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.962
with the sound off if it's...

624
00:27:43.064 --> 00:27:45.566
Hey. guys.
Got those chairs for you--

625
00:27:45.668 --> 00:27:47.069
Get 'em outta here.

626
00:27:50.975 --> 00:27:52.641
You know. sometimes
I'll go to the movies

627
00:27:52.743 --> 00:27:55.077
and I'll plug my ears. Yup.

628
00:27:55.179 --> 00:27:58.116
I'll even go the extra mile
and close my eyes too.

629
00:27:58.218 --> 00:27:59.751
[inhales deeply]

630
00:27:59.853 --> 00:28:03.588
Yeah. You know. to really
experience something.

631
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.956
you have to completely
shut it out.

632
00:28:07.495 --> 00:28:10.488
I did that
with my ex-wife too.

633
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.262
Yeah. didn't talk to her
or look at her for a month once.

634
00:28:16.502 --> 00:28:18.067
She didn't get it at all.

635
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.673
Hey. I'm throwing
a party tonight.

636
00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:24.404
You'll love it. But. uh.
I'll give you a ride.

637
00:28:24.506 --> 00:28:27.910
I'm gonna go do some push-ups.
Get jacked for this one. Ah.

638
00:28:28.012 --> 00:28:30.813
[clears throat]
I got your chair. Mr. Pronto.

639
00:28:30.915 --> 00:28:32.477
They're ready
for you. Mr. Pronto.

640
00:28:33.749 --> 00:28:34.880
[tires screeching]

641
00:28:34.982 --> 00:28:37.757
[upbeat music playing]

642
00:28:44.364 --> 00:28:45.391
Have some of that.

643
00:28:47.096 --> 00:28:48.826
James Dean died
right over there.

644
00:28:48.928 --> 00:28:50.995
[engine revving]

645
00:28:51.097 --> 00:28:52.532
[Chad] Terrible tragedy.

646
00:28:53.469 --> 00:28:56.974
Except I got the big brake kit
in this baby. Watch it go.

647
00:28:57.677 --> 00:29:00.278
- [engine revving]
- [laughing]

648
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.846
Yeah. motherfucker!

649
00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:04.447
Hold the wheel.
Stay straight.
stay straight.

650
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:05.878
[tires screeching]

651
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.353
Where the fuck is it?

652
00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:10.356
- [gun clicks]
- [laughs]

653
00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:12.289
- [gunshots]
- [Chad yelling]

654
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:15.227
Whoo! Yeah!

655
00:29:15.329 --> 00:29:17.060
[yelling. laughing]

656
00:29:20.201 --> 00:29:21.163
[sizzles]

657
00:29:22.934 --> 00:29:24.802
- [glass shatters]
- What the fuck?

658
00:29:24.904 --> 00:29:27.770
That was a fresh
fuckin' drink. douchebag!

659
00:29:27.872 --> 00:29:29.675
Ugh. Christ.
Who the fuck does that?

660
00:29:29.777 --> 00:29:31.940
This party sucks.
And this house sucks.

661
00:29:32.042 --> 00:29:33.272
Hey. have any of you
seen my boyfriend?

662
00:29:33.374 --> 00:29:35.547
Hello? No one? None of you
have seen Greg?

663
00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:37.811
Awesome. Thanks so much
for nothing.

664
00:29:37.913 --> 00:29:39.379
Where is my boyfriend?

665
00:29:40.748 --> 00:29:42.453
[gasps]

666
00:29:42.555 --> 00:29:43.818
- Chad. hi.
- Hey.

667
00:29:43.921 --> 00:29:46.892
- Your house is so sick.
- Cool.

668
00:29:48.427 --> 00:29:49.559

00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:25.990
Ah! Sorry to keep you
waiting like that. dude.

1005
00:46:26.092 --> 00:46:29.325
Was dealing with some. uh.
bank stuff. you know. just...

1006
00:46:29.427 --> 00:46:31.327
Anyway. Hey...

1007
00:46:31.429 --> 00:46:33.832
Maria! Sun!

1008
00:46:34.598 --> 00:46:36.828
- Yes?
- Sun!

1009
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.729
- What?
- Sun!

1010
00:46:38.831 --> 00:46:40.201
Okay!

1011
00:46:41.705 --> 00:46:42.971
There you go. [chuckles]

1012
00:46:43.073 --> 00:46:44.200
Dude. I can't believe
you're here. man.

1013
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:45.672
Thanks so much for coming by.

1014
00:46:45.774 --> 00:46:46.941
Huge fan. Huge fan.

1015
00:46:47.043 --> 00:46:48.272
I love the shit
you've been doing. man.

1016
00:46:48.374 --> 00:46:49.678
Breaking the fourth wall
and everything.

1017
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.075
and it-- it got me thinking.

1018
00:46:51.177 --> 00:46:52.683
got the old wheels turning.

1019
00:46:52.785 --> 00:46:54.414
that. you know.
you look into the camera

1020
00:46:54.516 --> 00:46:57.251
with two eyes and the audience
just. you know. they love it.

1021
00:46:57.353 --> 00:47:00.851
They love it. right? So. what if
you had a thousand eyes?

1022
00:47:01.787 --> 00:47:04.927
'Cause mosquitoes got a shit ton
of eyes. you know that. right?

1023
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.259
I mean. can you imagine
the audience's reaction

1024
00:47:07.361 --> 00:47:09.829
if you locked all those
fuckin' eyes on 'em?

1025
00:47:09.931 --> 00:47:12.068
I mean. it'd be crazy.

1026
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.532
Their brains would explode
inside of their skulls.

1027
00:47:14.634 --> 00:47:16.573
It would just be like
a fuckin' lava lamp in there

1028
00:47:16.675 --> 00:47:17.974
when they get MRIs. [laughs]

1029
00:47:18.076 --> 00:47:20.036
Yeah. Hey. come on.
Lemme show you the house. right?

1030
00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:22.078
Maria. espressos!

1031
00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.541
Oh.

1032
00:47:24.643 --> 00:47:27.578
So if you have any questions.
please. fire away.

1033
00:47:29.253 --> 00:47:31.582
Yeah. and all this wood is real.
you know. I think so.

1034
00:47:31.684 --> 00:47:34.218
Oh. here. here we go.
This is it. This.
this right here?

1035
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.252
This was a gift
from Prince Harry.

1036
00:47:36.355 --> 00:47:37.891
Uh. I think
it was Prince Harry.

1037
00:47:37.993 --> 00:47:39.796
The. you know.
the ginger one.

1038
00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:42.228
Yeah. it. uh-- it was
one of the original

1039
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.527
<i>Knights of the Round Table</i>
sword or somethin'.

1040
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.296
Can't really remember.
'cause I wasn't listening

1041
00:47:46.398 --> 00:47:48.168
when he gave it to me.
but. uh. yeah.

1042
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.401
No. it's. uh. like one
of three in the world.

1043
00:47:50.503 --> 00:47:53.008
A lot of the art
in this joint is very rare.

1044
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:54.804
- All has a story behind it.
- [shatters]

1045
00:47:54.906 --> 00:47:58.144
Uh. I mean. you could literally
take all day talking about it.

1046
00:47:58.246 --> 00:48:00.777
The house was built
by Orson Welles.

1047
00:48:00.879 --> 00:48:03.449
I had to redo most of it though.
The guy had terrible taste.

1048
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:05.448
Olivia Newton-John lived here
for a short time too.

1049
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.256
She put in the disco room.
Oh. dude.

1050
00:48:07.358 --> 00:48:09.754
I had the craziest
Russian chicks in here
the other day.

1051
00:48:09.857 --> 00:48:12.660
I mean. just insane.
Yeah. I mean.
Russians know how to party.

1052
00:48:12.762 --> 00:48:15.195
It's 'cause of all that snow
they got over there.
you know that. right?

1053
00:48:15.297 --> 00:48:17.933
Makes people insane.
Yeah. Russians love me.

1054
00:48:18.035 --> 00:48:19.363
Putin actually asked me
to be best man

1055
00:48:19.465 --> 00:48:20.965
at one of his
karate tournaments.

1056
00:48:21.067 --> 00:48:22.335
Whatever that means.

1057
00:48:22.437 --> 00:48:23.673
I actually couldn't do it.
Here. check it out.

1058
00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:26.108
- [door slams]
- [lock clicks]

1059
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.644
[Lex] Wanna go ahead.
take a deep breath. relax.

1060
00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:31.543
[static hums on TV]

1061
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:33.952
<i>Namaste.</i>

1062
00:48:34.818 --> 00:48:36.713

1063

[camera shutter clicking]

1067
00:48:44.397 --> 00:48:45.425
There you go.

1068
00:48:46.597 --> 00:48:47.824
[Lex sighs]

1069
00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:50.628
- [dings]
- I'm creating a book
of celebrity photos.

1070
00:48:53.604 --> 00:48:56.366
You know. I feel like
the mosquito
isn't appreciated by people

1071
00:48:56.468 --> 00:48:58.369
because of the itchiness
of the bite.

1072
00:48:58.471 --> 00:49:01.007
You know? But you gotta
respect 'em. man.

1073
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:02.341
I mean. they can fly around

1074
00:49:02.444 --> 00:49:04.475
with a tremendous amount
of blood in their noses.

1075
00:49:04.578 --> 00:49:07.381
which is much more than
I can say for you or me.

1076
00:49:08.421 --> 00:49:09.818
Hey. Maria!

1077
00:49:09.921 --> 00:49:12.221
- [cups clattering]
- Maria?

1078
00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:14.155
Yeah?

1079
00:49:14.257 --> 00:49:16.086
- Which belt?
- They're the same. yeah?

1080
00:49:16.188 --> 00:49:18.023
- Belt?
- Yeah.

1081
00:49:18.125 --> 00:49:20.292
- Which belt?
- Both?

1082
00:49:20.394 --> 00:49:22.033
Hmm. all right.
I'll try it. yeah.

1083
00:49:23.364 --> 00:49:25.502
Okay. I gotta get
to the bank. Maria.

1084
00:49:25.604 --> 00:49:27.570
Shoo. shoo. shoo!

1085
00:49:27.672 --> 00:49:28.971
Shoo. shoo. shoo!

1086

Shoo. shoo. shoo. shoo.
shoo. shoo. shoo. shoo...

1089
00:49:37.248 --> 00:49:39.644
Hop in. Mr. Pronto.
They want us out of here.

1090

Latte.

1093
00:49:59.435 --> 00:50:01.766
I'm going to the south
of France for a few days.

1094
00:50:02.402 --> 00:50:04.007
I've been invited
by Louis Ver.

1095
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:06.776
the handbag designer.
to stay at his villa.

1096
00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:08.409
and I'm taking
the children.

1097
00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:11.181
I just think we need
a little breather.

1098
00:50:11.283 --> 00:50:14.679
given your rage episodes
and this whole lawsuit thing.

1099
00:50:15.988 --> 00:50:17.450
The shaman is out back
waiting for you.

1100
00:50:17.552 --> 00:50:22.487
- [bells jingling]
- [woman chanting gibberish]

1101
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:27.028
[singsong] Look at me.
Don't look at me.

1102
00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:29.999
Look at me.
Don't look at me. ha!

1103
00:50:30.101 --> 00:50:33.602
Look at me in the face.
Don't look away.

1104
00:50:33.704 --> 00:50:34.669
Do look at me.

1105
00:50:34.771 --> 00:50:37.507
Beige banana.

1106
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:39.676
Beige banana.

1107
00:50:39.778 --> 00:50:43.611
Do you have any bananas?

1108
00:50:43.714 --> 00:50:44.946
I'm hungry.

1109
00:50:45.048 --> 00:50:46.577
[chants indistinctly. blows air]

1110
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.852
- [drum pounding]
- [chanting indistinctly]

1111
00:50:48.954 --> 00:50:50.016
- [thuds]
- Good. we're done.

1112
00:50:50.118 --> 00:50:51.384
I really do apologize

1113
00:50:51.487 --> 00:50:54.191
for getting a little bit
of wax in your eyeball.

1114
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:59.028
So. today's session
will be 6.000 dollars.

1115
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:01.493
and. uh. for check
writing purposes.

1116
00:51:01.596 --> 00:51:03.431
I know I told you my name
is Mountain Bride.

1117
00:51:03.533 --> 00:51:06.663
but. uh. if you could
make it out to Shelley Gube.

1118
00:51:06.765 --> 00:51:09.072
- We are mosquito people now.
- [laughing]

1119
00:51:09.174 --> 00:51:10.908
- We sure are.
- Isn't that right. Latte?

1120
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.877
My psychic said
it was gonna happen.

1121
00:51:12.979 --> 00:51:14.276
I knew we were gonna
work together again.

1122
00:51:14.378 --> 00:51:15.473
- We are so excited.
- Have you been working out?

1123
00:51:15.575 --> 00:51:17.080
We're so excited.
You look so good.

1124
00:51:17.182 --> 00:51:18.545
You do. it looks like
you've been in the sun.

1125
00:51:18.647 --> 00:51:20.347
- Have you gotten sun?
You've gotten sun.
- Yeah.

1126
00:51:20.449 --> 00:51:22.517
I feel like--
have you been using that--

1127
00:51:23.053 --> 00:51:24.552
- Which line?
- Hey. boss?

1128
00:51:24.654 --> 00:51:26.588
I know you're waiting
on number one
to jump out of HMU.

1129
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.725
but I want you to know
that FX is all set
and ready to pop. okay?

1130
00:51:29.827 --> 00:51:30.994
What the hell is this?

1131
00:51:31.563 --> 00:51:34.294
This is your tennis ball
cannon. okay? We're set.
we're ready to go.

1132
00:51:34.396 --> 00:51:35.660
I got your speed.
I got your violence.

1133
00:51:35.762 --> 00:51:37.561
I got your velocity.
I got all you can handle.

1134
00:51:37.663 --> 00:51:39.067
Okay. I thought it was
gonna be like a--

1135
00:51:39.169 --> 00:51:40.971
Like a handheld thing
so you can--

1136
00:51:41.073 --> 00:51:42.404
That's-- that's not
what I was told.

1137
00:51:42.506 --> 00:51:44.234
Talk to your production
designer. Watch your face.

1138
00:51:44.336 --> 00:51:46.976
But we're gonna be over here.
I'm on 13. You tell me
anything you need.

1139
00:51:47.078 --> 00:51:48.042
- All right?
- Excellent. Thank you.

1140
00:51:48.144 --> 00:51:49.510
You look great in that hat.

1141
00:51:50.517 --> 00:51:51.614
Thank you.

1142
00:51:51.716 --> 00:51:53.818
[metal clanking]

1143
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.513
Oh. um...
Ugh. this is Victor.

1144
00:51:56.615 --> 00:51:58.583
He specializes
in monster makeup.

1145
00:51:58.686 --> 00:52:00.523
He'll be applying
your mosquito prosthetics.

1146
00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:02.654
- so good luck with that.
- [woman 1] Just hold
your breath.

1147
00:52:02.756 --> 00:52:04.160
- [woman 2] Wow.
- [woman 1] Hold your breath.

1148
00:52:04.262 --> 00:52:05.625
[woman 2] You look like
the Mosquito already.

1149
00:52:05.727 --> 00:52:08.564
[woman 1] It's almost on
your face. Just count to three.

1150
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.927
[rumbling]

1151
00:52:14.334 --> 00:52:16.570
[tense music playing]

1152
00:52:20.776 --> 00:52:21.740
Oh!

1153
00:52:27.016 --> 00:52:28.747
Okay. let's do this.

1154
00:52:29.714 --> 00:52:31.282
Okay. so. uh.
here's the action.

1155
00:52:31.384 --> 00:52:32.954
You got tennis ball one.

1156
00:52:33.056 --> 00:52:34.254
That's gonna be Crow Man.

1157
00:52:34.356 --> 00:52:35.757
All right?
Crow Man comes at you.

1158
00:52:35.859 --> 00:52:37.058
Ah! You duck.

1159
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.458
Tennis balls two and three.

1160
00:52:38.561 --> 00:52:41.397
those are blasts
from his bug spray cannons.

1161
00:52:41.499 --> 00:52:43.532
All right. they hit you.
Okay. then I need a. you know.

1162
00:52:43.634 --> 00:52:46.062
"Oh. shit. I'm down. Crow Man's
gonna eat me." kind of face.

1163
00:52:46.164 --> 00:52:47.871
And that's when you do your
eye thing right to the camera.

1164
00:52:47.973 --> 00:52:49.639
You ready? Here we go. folks.

1165
00:52:49.741 --> 00:52:51.574
And playtime.

1166
00:52:52.044 --> 00:52:53.607
- [ball fires]
- [ball thuds]

1167
00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.739

01:00:27.998 --> 01:00:29.961
you've been backed into
this corner right here. right?

1335
01:00:30.063 --> 01:00:32.362
And-- no way out.
What's gonna happen?

1336
01:00:32.464 --> 01:00:35.568
For the first time.
this is when you sprout
your wings.

1337
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.840
you jump and then you fly.

1338
01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:42.745
Right? Hey. hey. hey. hey.
Hey. don't worry.

1339
01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:44.540
Don't worry. no stress. okay?
It's easy. All right?

1340
01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:47.881
All you gotta do is just go over
and let gravity do the rest.

1341
01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:50.115
Latte. all the top guys
do their own stunts.

1342
01:00:50.217 --> 01:00:51.888
- Mm-hmm. Will you
fuck off. please?
- Okay.

1343
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.088
Yeah. thank you.
All right. here. listen.
This stuff is easy.

1344
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.424
You know what?
We'll rehearse one.
You'll get a feel for it.

1345
01:00:56.526 --> 01:00:57.726
Hey. are my henchmen ready?

1346
01:00:57.828 --> 01:01:00.928
Okay. so. all right.
here we go. And playtime!

1347
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:05.300
- [actors shouting]
- [dramatic music playing]

1348

[monitor beeping]

1352
01:01:24.816 --> 01:01:26.949
There he is.

1353
01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.891
You're lucky to be alive.

1354
01:01:30.492 --> 01:01:32.059
Energy drink?

1355
01:01:33.495 --> 01:01:35.060
No? Okay.

1356
01:01:35.162 --> 01:01:38.395
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

1357
01:01:40.138 --> 01:01:41.168
[sighs]

1358
01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:43.868
Latte. I can't actually see you.

1359
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.607
I've had a little work done

1360
01:01:45.709 --> 01:01:47.102
and I have to wear
these bandages

1361
01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.106
for another week or so. but...

1362
01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:51.341
I understand you're
in terrible shape.

1363
01:01:51.443 --> 01:01:54.081
Well. I'm glad you're alive.
I really. truly am.

1364
01:01:54.183 --> 01:01:58.116
but I can't take these wild
emotional swings anymore.

1365
01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:00.821
You're getting arrested
and then the lawsuits.

1366
01:02:00.923 --> 01:02:02.686
and now this attempt
on your own life.

1367
01:02:02.788 --> 01:02:05.221
Well... [sighs]

1368
01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:07.930
There's no easy way
to say it. but...

1369
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.460
we're getting divorced.

1370
01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:14.266
I'm with Chad now.

1371
01:02:15.674 --> 01:02:17.907
- Where is he?
- [Chad] I'm over here.

1372
01:02:21.313 --> 01:02:23.044
[sighs] Sorry. bro.

1373
01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.048
[Christiana] Take care. Latte.

1374
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.784
Oh...

1375
01:02:30.582 --> 01:02:34.121
- [PA system beeps]
- [indistinct PA announcement]

1376
01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.288
Bummer.

1377
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.058
Well. look on the bright side.

1378
01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.298
They finished the film
with your stand-in

1379
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.358
and word on the street.

1380
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.429
and I don't want you
to get too excited.

1381
01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:48.335
is that it's the best movie
in the history of filmmaking.

1382
01:02:48.437 --> 01:02:49.339
[sighs]

1383
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:50.704
"One of the worst movies

1384
01:02:50.806 --> 01:02:52.876
in the history of filmmaking"?

"Latte Pronto's old tricks

In this he sucks

1388
01:03:00.851 --> 01:03:02.315
Okay. guys.
let's keep it going. huh?

1389
01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:05.081
I got you a second truck so it
wouldn't take forever. Let's go.

1390
01:03:05.184 --> 01:03:06.850
What the hell's
going on here?

1391
01:03:07.453 --> 01:03:08.920
- What are you doing?
What is that?
- Oh.

1392

What's going on here. guys?

1393
01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:12.057
Hey. Latte. how you doin'?

1394
01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:14.124
Remember me?
I'm your business manager.

1395
01:03:14.226 --> 01:03:15.965
Yeah. a little bit
of bad news.

1396
01:03:16.067 --> 01:03:19.736
Uh. it looks like between
the shamans. the divorce.

1397
01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.570
and your expensive lifestyle
in general.

1398
01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.837
you-- you don't have any monies.

1399
01:03:23.939 --> 01:03:25.572
Isn't it your job
to make him money?

1400
01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:27.574
You from the IRS?

1401
01:03:27.676 --> 01:03:28.973
No. I'm an intern.

1402
01:03:29.075 --> 01:03:30.645
Oh. well. then the answer is no.

1403
01:03:30.747 --> 01:03:32.075
it's my job to make me money.

1404
01:03:32.177 --> 01:03:34.647
That's what a job is. [laughs]

1405
01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:36.579
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1406
01:03:37.488 --> 01:03:38.751
Do you need an intern?

1407
01:03:38.853 --> 01:03:39.984
[manager] I can't pay you.

1408
01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:41.625
[intern] Legally you'd have to.

1409
01:03:41.727 --> 01:03:42.822
Well. no. there's
ways around that.

1410
01:03:42.924 --> 01:03:44.725
You got a lot to learn. kid.

1411
01:03:44.827 --> 01:03:46.088
You want the job or what. eh?

1412
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.060
- Sure.
- Ah. good move.

1413
01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:50.230
You're gonna do
very well in this town.

1414
01:03:50.332 --> 01:03:52.732
Now. go get me a coffee
and keep the receipt. okay?

1415
01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:53.865
[intern] Oh. no problem.

1416
01:03:53.967 --> 01:03:55.400
Take care. Mr. Pronto.

1417
01:03:58.076 --> 01:04:01.772
Latte. things turn around
for you. you gimme a call. okay?

1418
01:04:01.874 --> 01:04:03.243
I'm your guy.

1419
01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:04.981
[Lenny] I think it's time
we popped in on your agent

1420
01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:07.146
and let her know you're ready
to get back in the game.

1421
01:04:07.249 --> 01:04:08.877
And there's nothing to panic
about here. pal.

1422
01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.152
You're still an A-list guy.
so let's keep
our heads up. right?

1423
01:04:12.254 --> 01:04:15.659
Hi. I'm here with Latte Pronto
to see his agent.

1424
01:04:15.761 --> 01:04:17.820
Oh. I'm sorry.
She's in a meeting.

1425
01:04:17.923 --> 01:04:19.157
We can wait.

1426
01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:21.525
Well. she has a lot
of meetings today.

1427
01:04:21.627 --> 01:04:24.493
How can you-- How do you know?
What is-- You know what?

1428
01:04:24.595 --> 01:04:28.297
You can't do this.
I'm here with Latte Pronto.

1429
01:04:28.399 --> 01:04:29.900
- Uh-huh?
- Do you know who he is?

1430
01:04:30.002 --> 01:04:31.937
He's an A-list guy.

1431
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.710
- Uh-huh. right.
- No. he's an--

1432
01:04:34.812 --> 01:04:37.273
- He's an A-list guy!
- Right.

1433
01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.378
You can't do this.
and you know what?

1434
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.585
I need to talk to your--
No. I don't-- We're going in.

1435
01:04:42.687 --> 01:04:45.481
Hey. you can't go back there!

1436
01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:47.519
- [door slams]
- What the hell is going on?

1437
01:04:47.621 --> 01:04:51.628
This some kind of power play?
Latte Pronto is an A-list guy.

1438
01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.489
He's an A-list
and he wants to work.

1439
01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:56.733
so let's get cracking--
Wait. what is this?

1440
01:04:56.835 --> 01:04:58.767
Look. I would love
to help you guys.

1441
01:04:58.869 --> 01:05:00.534
but between the fighting
and the ODs.

1442
01:05:00.636 --> 01:05:03.166
and most importantly.
the bad movie.
the phone's just not ringing.

1443
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:05.306
What-- You put him
in that movie.

1444
01:05:05.408 --> 01:05:10.006
What do you want me to say?
The phone... is not... ringing.

1445
01:05:10.108 --> 01:05:11.580
What the-- [grumbles]

1446
01:05:11.682 --> 01:05:13.609
Well. then call somebody.

1447
01:05:13.711 --> 01:05:16.214
Look. why don't you just lay low
for a little while?

1448
01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:17.479
I'll call you
if something comes up.

1449
01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.187
Right now. there's just
nothing happening.

1450
01:05:19.289 --> 01:05:21.318
Now. if you'll excuse me.
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

1451
01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.321
You remember
your stand-in. right?

1452
01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:26.424
Is this has-been
gonna take up all my time?

1453
01:05:26.526 --> 01:05:29.361
Get the hell outta here. man.
You make me sick.

1454
01:05:29.463 --> 01:05:32.395
You make me sick!
You're why<i> Mosquito Boy</i> sucked.

1455
01:05:32.497 --> 01:05:35.069
You know what?
We don't need you guys.

1456
01:05:35.171 --> 01:05:37.700
I'll get Latte a gig myself.
You're fired!

1457
01:05:58.191 --> 01:06:00.426
[soft mysterious music playing]

1458
01:06:05.063 --> 01:06:06.300
Come this way.

1459
01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:08.132
Just down here.

1460
01:06:08.234 --> 01:06:10.337
[people shouting indistinctly]

1461

- This one's mine.
- [distant siren wailing]

1462
01:06:26.222 --> 01:06:28.383
I'm sorry. this place
is a bit of a mess.

1463
01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.226
Just all about work these days.

1464
01:06:34.196 --> 01:06:39.833
Also. if I'm being
completely honest. I...

1465
01:06:39.935 --> 01:06:41.335
I haven't made much money.

1466
01:06:43.137 --> 01:06:44.767
You're my first real client.

1467
01:06:47.177 --> 01:06:49.508
I'm from a small town
in Northern Canada.

1468
01:06:53.516 --> 01:06:55.882
[voice breaking]
I don't really have
anyone back there.

1469
01:06:55.984 --> 01:06:57.219
Or here. for that matter.

1470
01:07:05.893 --> 01:07:07.130
Except you.

1471
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.104
I'm so grateful to you.

1472
01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:17.767
[sniffles] You have no idea.

1473
01:07:19.408 --> 01:07:22.942
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. [sniffles]

1474
01:07:23.044 --> 01:07:25.310
Let me finish. [sniffles]

1475
01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:29.449
Don't worry. pal.
I'll get us back on top.

1476
01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:33.453
It's just baby steps.
It's just baby steps. [mumbles]

1477
01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:37.024
I'll get you in front
of that camera where you belong.

1478
01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:39.690
'Cause it only takes
one good gig.

[soda can hisses open]

1481
01:07:50.509 --> 01:07:51.841
[sighs] Okay.

1482
01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.172
they're reducing
the offer by half.

1483
01:07:53.274 --> 01:07:54.439
but they'll let you
keep the mask.

1484
01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.947
I know I used your celebrity
to get the gig.

1485
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:58.648
but I'm starting to think
it's for the best

1486
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.774
that you stay anonymous.

1487
01:07:59.877 --> 01:08:02.017
Are you sure you don't need
an energy drink? Mm.

1488
01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:04.514
Remember. it's not porn.
it's erotica.

1489
01:08:04.616 --> 01:08:06.651
so just be yourself
and try to have fun.

1490
01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.325
[woman grunts. sniffles]

1491
01:08:11.624 --> 01:08:16.133
Well. I can't afford
the rent. Mr. Landlord.

1492
01:08:16.235 --> 01:08:19.796
But I'm sure there are some
other ways I can pay you.

1493

[chuckles]

1494
01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:24.372
Come on. big boy.

1495
01:08:26.374 --> 01:08:29.472
Let's see what we're
workin' with here.

1496

- Huh? Huh?
- [bed squeaking]

1497
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:33.576
Here. Here.

[director groans]

1500
01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:42.686
Oh. yeah. oh yeah.
You like that. baby?

1501
01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:45.459
You like watching your wife
fuck the landlord

1502
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:48.825
'cause your limp dick
can't pay the fucking rent?

1503
01:08:50.628 --> 01:08:52.728
Okay. That was not
a great idea.

1504
01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:55.535
Erotica. my ass.
That was definitely pornography.

1505
01:08:55.637 --> 01:08:58.203
We should have tried to book
a sitcom or a commercial.

1506
01:08:58.305 --> 01:08:59.671
No. we went too far. too fast.

1507

Okay. wait. wait. wait.
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1508
01:09:01.373 --> 01:09:02.372
Did they see your penis?

1509
01:09:02.474 --> 01:09:04.947
Oh. I can see the papers now.

1510
01:09:05.049 --> 01:09:06.243
Oh. it's the only thing
in showbiz

01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:07.444
you can't get away with.

1512
01:09:07.546 --> 01:09:09.551
They'll crucify you!
We'll be ruined!

1513
01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:11.119
Mm. mm. mm.

1514
01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:13.690
Okay. Okay. we can put
a good spin on this.

1515
01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:16.391
No. no. Ah. there's. uh...

1516
01:09:17.662 --> 01:09:18.756
I just gotta--

Excuse me. Mr. Pronto?

1521
01:09:47.456 --> 01:09:49.721
Could I speak to you
in the hall. please?

1522
01:09:57.234 --> 01:10:00.633
So. there's no easy way
of saying this.

1523
01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:05.166
Could I take a selfie?

1524
01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.639
For my wife. really.
She's a big fan!

1525
01:10:08.742 --> 01:10:11.144
This one is stable.
I'll move him down to three.

1526
01:10:11.246 --> 01:10:12.744
I got a dead John Doe here.

1527
01:10:12.846 --> 01:10:15.615
Take him down to cremation.
I'll start the paperwork.

1528

Sorry it's so many.

1531
01:10:23.621 --> 01:10:25.794
Maybe funny faces this time.

1533
01:10:29.966 --> 01:10:31.267
Sorry about that.

1534
01:10:31.369 --> 01:10:33.666
Let's take a couple
more pictures. Carol. come here!

1535
01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.470
My wife's gonna love this.

1536
01:10:37.573 --> 01:10:41.306
My whole family's
gonna love this. [laughs]

1537
01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:44.446
Oh. Were you with the patient?

1538
01:10:45.477 --> 01:10:46.775
I'm afraid he passed.

1539
01:10:46.877 --> 01:10:49.286
We just sent him down
to cremation.

1540
01:10:50.586 --> 01:10:53.521
I'm so sorry.
You missed his final moments.

Hello. is anyone there?

1544

How are you feeling?

1545
01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:11.807
Alive. That's good. I guess.

1546
01:11:11.909 --> 01:11:13.343
That's everything.

1547
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.047
Is there anyone here for me?

1548
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:21.949
Hmm. there was a man.
but he left.

1549

He didn't come back.

1550
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.656
Hmm... That makes sense.

1551
01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:35.090
I did him wrong. really.

1552
01:11:36.994 --> 01:11:39.094
I never should have
pushed him that hard.

1553
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.836
What was I thinking?

1554
01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:48.304
Erotic films?

1555
01:11:48.406 --> 01:11:50.347
I lost my mind.

1556
01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:55.781
I don't always see
the big picture.

1557
01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:08.596
I need to be more observant
to the needs of others
around me.

That's what you do
all day. right?

It was the only urn
I had available
in your price range.

1565
01:12:39.828 --> 01:12:45.134
On another note.
I'm a huge fan
of all your movies.

But I'm telling you.
everything is by design.

down eventually.

[birds squawking]

1673
01:19:08.384 --> 01:19:09.412
Damn. man.

1674
01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:11.480
My bad.

1675
01:19:14.687 --> 01:19:17.420
[coughing]

1676
01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.329
[choking. coughing]

1677
01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:42.084
Good thing you were here.
You saved that guy's life.

1678
01:19:42.186 --> 01:19:43.215
Wait.

1679
01:19:43.982 --> 01:19:45.283
Are you Latte Pronto?

1680
01:19:47.524 --> 01:19:49.053
Oh. [chuckles excitedly]

1681
01:19:49.155 --> 01:19:51.557
Oh. my God. Alvie!
It's Latte Pronto!

1682
01:19:51.659 --> 01:19:53.590
Latte Pronto. Huh?

1683
01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:54.725
[laughs]

1684
01:19:54.827 --> 01:19:56.161
Oh. my gosh. Yeah.

1685
01:19:56.263 --> 01:19:58.731
[sighs] Look. Lenny.
you're just not on the list.

1686
01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:00.703
But you know me by now. Gandhi.

1687
01:20:00.805 --> 01:20:02.298
Yeah. but that doesn't put you
on the list.

1688
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.473
But you're not even looking
at the list.

1689
01:20:04.575 --> 01:20:05.974
'Cause I know you're not on it.

1690
01:20:07.573 --> 01:20:10.343
Look. I'm sorry. you're right.
Anything we can work out?

1691
01:20:10.445 --> 01:20:11.172
[sighs]

1692
01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:12.714
Hey. did you hear about Latte?

1693
01:20:12.816 --> 01:20:14.882
No. You know something
about Latte?

1694
01:20:14.985 --> 01:20:17.013
They're giving him a key
to the city. [chuckles]

1695
01:20:17.115 --> 01:20:18.852
Some guys got all the luck. huh?

1696
01:20:18.954 --> 01:20:20.251
[mayor on TV]
<i>In honor of his courage</i>

1697
01:20:20.353 --> 01:20:22.318

<i>toward his fellow man.</i>

1698
01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.688

1699

- Wow.

1700
01:20:26.557 --> 01:20:27.794
<i>...that I present Mr.</i>
<i>Pronto with this.</i>

1701
01:20:27.896 --> 01:20:29.993
the key to the city
of Los Angeles.

1702

[crowd cheering and applauding]

1703
01:20:33.498 --> 01:20:35.568
Now. don't try to get in
the City Hall with that.

1704
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:36.769
It's purely symbolic.

1705
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:38.468
- [chuckles]
- [crowd laughs]

1706
01:20:39.476 --> 01:20:40.768
But all jokes aside.

1707
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:44.445
I'd like to talk to you
in earnest about
running for office.

1708
01:20:44.547 --> 01:20:46.113
Let's grab lunch. huh?

1709
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:48.512
I've had a good run.

1710
01:20:49.215 --> 01:20:51.184
But nobody wants
to be mayor forever.

1711
01:20:53.021 --> 01:20:54.116
If you're not moving up
in this world.

1712
01:20:54.218 --> 01:20:57.056
you're moving out. or over.

1713
01:20:57.158 --> 01:20:59.357
[chuckles] Or whatever
the expression is.

1714
01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:03.296
That's why I'm gonna take a run
at the Senate. [chuckles]

1715
01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:06.230
Now. I'm gonna need somebody
to fill my shoes.

1716
01:21:06.332 --> 01:21:09.001
Somebody who's gonna
endorse me. of course.

1717
01:21:09.103 --> 01:21:11.903
And someone
who the people will love.

1718
01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:14.776
And that's where you come in.

1719
01:21:14.878 --> 01:21:17.340
Well. people love
a comeback story.

1720
01:21:17.443 --> 01:21:20.145
If you can pretend to be
a person in the movies.

1721
01:21:20.247 --> 01:21:22.479
you can pretend to be
a person in life.

1722
01:21:22.581 --> 01:21:24.753
- [footsteps approaching]
- [woman] Sorry. I'm late.

1723
01:21:24.855 --> 01:21:26.950
Did some quick polling.
They love him.

1724
01:21:27.052 --> 01:21:28.484
They absolutely love him.

1725
01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:30.452
- Ah.
- I've always been able
to pick a winner.

1726
01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:33.958
Well. speaking of winners.
Latte. this is Terry.

1727
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.760
[Terry] We have a lot to do.

1728
01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:37.263
His image is fine.

1729
01:21:37.365 --> 01:21:39.294
but we have to figure out
what platform he'll run on.

1730
01:21:39.396 --> 01:21:41.837
Oh. that's easy.
He's for the people.

1731
01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:43.704
Well. every candidate
is for the people.

1732
01:21:43.806 --> 01:21:45.136
That's why it works. [chuckles]

1733
01:21:45.238 --> 01:21:48.002
No. The people
are ready for change.

1734
01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:50.438
How about. um...

1735
01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:54.409
Freeing America
from its corporate grip?

1736
01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:57.047
He's the anti-big
business candidate.

1737
01:21:57.149 --> 01:22:00.220
The-- the corporation killer.

1738
01:22:01.986 --> 01:22:03.085
I like that.

1739
01:22:03.854 --> 01:22:06.658
And. yes. he is for the fucking
people too. for Christ's sake.

1740
01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.629
[both laughing]

1741

[quirky music playing]

1742
01:22:10.029 --> 01:22:11.699
We'll be in touch. Latte.

1743
01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:13.294
You're gonna be great. Latte.

1744
01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:15.136
But I'm gonna need this back.

1745
01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:17.336
They're just for show.

1746
01:22:30.948 --> 01:22:32.252
Get in.

1747
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:39.424

[man groaning]

1754
01:23:52.535 --> 01:23:57.031
[Ed] I'm afraid my brother
is under the weather.
Mr. Pronto.

1755
01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:01.770
So. I will be speaking
on his behalf.

1756
01:24:03.109 --> 01:24:05.477
You're a man of few words.

1757
01:24:08.712 --> 01:24:12.517
It is very hard to trust
a man of few words.

1758
01:24:13.484 --> 01:24:15.418
It is hard to know
where he stands.

1759
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.861
So when he is selected.
and believe me.

1760
01:24:18.963 --> 01:24:21.559
all men in your position
are selected.

1761
01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:26.295
it is very disconcerting
to discover that suddenly.

1762
01:24:26.397 --> 01:24:28.731
he is a man with an agenda.

1763
01:24:29.567 --> 01:24:33.269
He has traded in
his cape for a cause.

1764
01:24:33.371 --> 01:24:36.908
He is a "corporation killer."

1765
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:38.741
"Anti-big business."

1766
01:24:39.749 --> 01:24:42.646
He's for the people.

1767
01:24:45.888 --> 01:24:47.750
Some dissent is good.

1768
01:24:49.893 --> 01:24:52.293
You must allow some dissent.

1769
01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.529
But is that what
"the people" want...

1770
01:24:59.966 --> 01:25:01.368
Mr. Pronto?

1771
01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:06.804
What do you know
of the people. hmm?

1772
01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:12.513
For the people
are bloodthirsty. Mr. Pronto.

1773
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:17.918
They sit in the dark
and sip syrupy sodas

1774
01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.420
like the blood of their enemies

1775
01:25:20.522 --> 01:25:25.554
while they watched
hyper-realized versions
of themselves

1776
01:25:25.656 --> 01:25:29.829
kill and kill
and kill some more.

1777
01:25:29.931 --> 01:25:31.827
And do you know why?

1778
01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:36.502
Because it makes them forget.

1779
01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:42.072
It makes them
stop asking questions.

1780
01:25:42.607 --> 01:25:46.446
Because we want
to ask the questions.

1781
01:25:47.079 --> 01:25:48.951
Such as...

1782
01:25:49.053 --> 01:25:52.947
Who are you really.
Latte Pronto?

1783
01:25:58.928 --> 01:26:00.328
Where do you come from?

1784
01:26:02.899 --> 01:26:04.661
What do you want. really?

1785
01:26:04.763 --> 01:26:08.298
Our little birdies
couldn't find a thing on you.

1786
01:26:08.401 --> 01:26:11.504
and we find that
most disturbing.

1787
01:26:12.304 --> 01:26:14.903
Most disturbing. indeed.

1788
01:26:17.073 --> 01:26:22.076
However. I do not need
to know your true identity.

1789
01:26:22.746 --> 01:26:25.350
I don't need to know
your past history

1790
01:26:25.452 --> 01:26:28.383
to know what it is
that you really want.

1791
01:26:28.485 --> 01:26:30.759
because it is what I want.

1792
01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:33.261
It is what all men want.

1793
01:26:33.363 --> 01:26:38.065
That is why we crave fame.
and power and money.

1794
01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:41.132
For what you want.
what I want.

1795
01:26:41.234 --> 01:26:43.566
and what all men want

1796
01:26:43.668 --> 01:26:48.974
is the unimpeded expulsion
of our jism!

[Don Cote groaning]

1798
01:26:50.178 --> 01:26:52.741
And when you seek to destroy

1799
01:26:52.843 --> 01:26:56.711
another man's fame.
or wealth. or power.

1800
01:26:56.813 --> 01:26:59.384
you seek to eliminate
the very tools

1801
01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:03.787
he has amassed to ensure
that expulsion!

1803
01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:10.029
My brother and I
will not be robbed

1804
01:27:10.131 --> 01:27:12.527
of our ability to expel!

1805
01:27:13.163 --> 01:27:18.571
We will not have the flow
of our natural desires
plugged up!

1806
01:27:19.837 --> 01:27:23.675
Our fluid will not be forced
to retreat inward!

1807
01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:25.879
So help me God!

01:27:25.981 --> 01:27:27.943

[dramatic music plays]

1810
01:27:31.684 --> 01:27:34.386
Latte! My man.
It's good to have you back!

1811
01:27:34.488 --> 01:27:36.924
You're a hero.
Everybody loves a hero!

1812

Key to the city? Come on!

1813
01:27:38.729 --> 01:27:39.820
And great news.

1814
01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:41.724
Despite being a colossal
critical failure.

1815
01:27:41.826 --> 01:27:43.431
<i>Mosquito Boy</i>
did rather well overseas.

1816
01:27:43.533 --> 01:27:46.131
I guess. uh. mosquitoes
are kind of a global irritant.

1817
01:27:46.233 --> 01:27:47.266
so people could relate.

1818
01:27:47.368 --> 01:27:48.662
I just feel like.
at this point.

1819
01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.038
you need someone
that gets you.

1820
01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:52.969
"I get Latte."
You know?

1821
01:27:53.071 --> 01:27:55.304
And the first step--
'cause you and I
are gonna do big things.

1822
01:27:55.406 --> 01:27:59.380
So the first step for that
is you gotta cut the rest
of the team loose.

1823
01:27:59.482 --> 01:28:03.282
Cut ties. You and me
are now doing big things.

1824
01:28:03.384 --> 01:28:05.079
We are out there.
We are scared.

1825
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:07.882
We don't have a plan.
so we're thinking on our feet.

1826
01:28:07.984 --> 01:28:10.291
We're on our backs.
thinking on our feet.

1827

We don't know what these
big opportunities are.

1828

We just know that
we have to get them.

1829

so exciting about being--

1842
01:29:11.319 --> 01:29:12.914
Come on. you know you love him.

1843
01:29:13.017 --> 01:29:14.988
You know you need him.
He's got what it takes.

1844
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:16.856
Give us another shot.

1845
01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:18.056
Please.

1846
01:29:18.726 --> 01:29:20.960
- I thought you didn't need me.
- Oh. but I do.

1847
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:25.366
I do. And I'm willing to change.
Big time. right?

1848
01:29:25.468 --> 01:29:28.800
Yeah. I want
the Latte Pronto treatment.

1849
01:29:33.508 --> 01:29:35.510
Latte Pronto...
[chuckles softly]

1850
01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.046
I don't know.

1851
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:41.043
Fame. fortune.
do they matter?

1852
01:29:42.548 --> 01:29:44.518
You really wanna be somebody.

1853
01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:48.721
I'd say find someone
who really cares about you.

1854
01:29:50.622 --> 01:29:52.021
That's what really matters.

1855
01:29:53.592 --> 01:29:55.794
[emotional music continues]

1856
01:29:58.869 --> 01:30:00.062
Jumpin' Jesus.

1857
01:30:01.299 --> 01:30:02.364
Latte!

1858
01:30:02.466 --> 01:30:03.837

Latte!

1864

Latte.

1866
01:30:28.457 --> 01:30:29.729
Latte.

1867
01:30:31.196 --> 01:30:32.226
Latte.

1868
01:30:33.902 --> 01:30:34.932
Latte.

1869
01:30:43.074 --> 01:30:47.076
[panting] Latte. please.
Just let me say one thing.

1870
01:30:47.743 --> 01:30:49.480
I'm sorry. [exhales]

1871
01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:51.979
I did you wrong.
I see that now.

1872
01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:53.614
If there's something
you need to tell me.

1873
01:30:53.716 --> 01:30:55.152
then just say it.

1874
01:30:55.254 --> 01:30:56.821
Say it.

1875
01:30:56.923 --> 01:31:00.362
I can handle it. I can change.
Just let me have it.

1876
01:31:00.464 --> 01:31:02.795
Help me become
the better version of myself.

1877
01:31:04.599 --> 01:31:08.003
Got it. Silent treatment.
That's fair.

1878
01:31:08.105 --> 01:31:09.269
You probably hate my guts.

1879
01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:11.265
But listen.
for what it's worth.

1880
01:31:12.274 --> 01:31:13.938
I don't care about the work.

1881
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:16.072
I just miss you.

1882
01:31:17.277 --> 01:31:20.643
I just miss you.

1883
01:31:20.745 --> 01:31:22.683
'Cause I really love you. pal.

1884
01:31:23.315 --> 01:31:24.685
I mean it.

1885
01:31:29.785 --> 01:31:31.956
I... love you too.

1886
01:31:35.393 --> 01:31:36.631
Thank you.

1887
01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:39.095

[laughing]

1891
01:31:55.415 --> 01:31:56.981
What's this? For me?

1892
01:31:59.451 --> 01:32:00.688
[chuckles]

1893
01:32:03.858 --> 01:32:06.089
Is this for real. pal?
[chuckles] It's just...

1894
01:32:08.729 --> 01:32:10.665
What am I looking
at here? Is this...

1895
01:32:11.761 --> 01:32:14.566
Could be real. Yeah...

1896
01:32:14.668 --> 01:32:16.704
It could be a bunch
of fool's gold.

1897
01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.334
You know?

1898
01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:24.146
You know what?

1899
01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:25.977
Forget it. We got each other.

1900
01:32:28.013 --> 01:32:30.619
You hungry? Come on.
let's grab a bite to eat.
