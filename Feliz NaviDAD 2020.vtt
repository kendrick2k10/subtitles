00:36:49.076 --> 00:36:51.121
That was fun.

878
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.341
- It was fun.

879
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:58.390
- Maybe we can bring out
the reindeer piñata this year?

880
00:36:58.477 --> 00:37:00.566
Hmm.
- Yeah.

881
00:37:00.653 --> 00:37:02.829
Maybe we can bring back
that part of the tradition.

882
00:37:04.918 --> 00:37:07.616
- Thank you. tía.

883
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.792
- Go.
Go see Charlotte for a break.

884
00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:11.098
Studying will still be here.

885
00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:12.621
and so will
my traditional borrowing

886
00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:14.319
of your index finger
for all the gift wrapping.

887

888
00:37:16.582 --> 00:37:17.974

- Hey. there. not-so-stranger.

892
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:47.221
- Toy lady.

893
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:48.701
Wow.

894
00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:51.443
- Oh. you clean up good.
I'll order us something.

895
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.271
You want to grab a table?

896
00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:55.098
- Oh. I'm sorry.

897
00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:58.885
I'd love to hang out.
but I sort of got a date.

898
00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:01.322
- Okay...

899
00:38:01.366 --> 00:38:03.803
- Yeah. My daughter set up
this dating profile for me.

900
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.413
and I promised
I'd give it a try.

901
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.719
She also made me promise

902
00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:08.373
not to tell the date
I have a daughter

903
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.679
because it might scare her off
before it even gets started.

904
00:38:10.766 --> 00:38:13.247
- Oh.

905
00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:16.816
Mm. you are terrible at this...

906
00:38:16.903 --> 00:38:21.342
But I get why you're confused.
Um. I'm the date.

907
00:38:21.386 --> 00:38:23.649
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

908
00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:27.261
Yes. and I'm scared
of children. so bye.

909
00:38:30.612 --> 00:38:33.876
I got you on that one.
I did. Yeah. I did.

910
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.574
Look. I had a late breakfast.
I'm just going to get coffee.

911
00:38:35.661 --> 00:38:37.880
You want something else?

912
00:38:37.924 --> 00:38:39.752
- Hey. I was supposed
to say that.

913
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:43.103
- Oh. well.
now you don't have to.

914
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.148
- So you picked me. huh?

915
00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:48.282
- Mm-hmm.
Swiped right on my SSD guy.

916
00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:50.806
You do like Christmas movies.
though. right?

917
00:38:50.893 --> 00:38:52.634
- Yes.

918
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:55.463
- And do you love Harry Styles
and boy bands in general.

919
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.771
or am I on a date
with your daughter?

920
00:38:58.858 --> 00:39:00.381
- Eh. I'm a little more
into classical music.

921
00:39:00.468 --> 00:39:02.427
- Oh.

922
00:39:02.514 --> 00:39:04.037
- Like Bach. Beethoven?
- Stones. Eagles--

923
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.082
- What?
- Who?

924
00:39:06.126 --> 00:39:07.823
- I mean. you said classical.
so I thought you meant--

925
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.738
- Oh. no. I'm sorry.
I meant classic music.

926
00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:12.045
not elevator music.

927
00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:13.699
- Elevator music. uh-huh.

928
00:39:13.786 --> 00:39:15.788
- You know. songs you hear.
like. in an elevator. right?

929
00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:17.180
- Yeah. okay.

930
00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:19.182
Hi. Can we get
two black coffees. please?

931
00:39:19.269 --> 00:39:20.793
- Sure.
- Thank you.

932
00:39:29.497 --> 00:39:32.935
-
All right. so...

933
00:39:33.022 --> 00:39:34.720
you like men in uniform.

934
00:39:34.807 --> 00:39:36.025
- Yeah.

935
00:39:36.112 --> 00:39:37.418
Well. typically the uniform

936
00:39:37.505 --> 00:39:40.465
comes with polite
and well-mannered.

937
00:39:40.552 --> 00:39:43.163
- Lucky you. because you got
charming and funny as a bonus.

938
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.687
- Oh. yeah. uh-huh.

939
00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:47.776
- Look. here's the deal.

940
00:39:47.863 --> 00:39:51.563
You're my first date
in... a while.

941
00:39:52.999 --> 00:39:54.261
- We can tell.

942
00:39:55.697 --> 00:39:56.959
Me too.

943
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:58.396
I mean. I downloaded the app.

944
00:39:58.483 --> 00:39:59.962
because once I get
back to Phoenix.

945
00:40:00.006 --> 00:40:01.964
I finally got to put myself
out there again.

946
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:03.749
- Ooh. great.

947
00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:05.794
That takes the pressure off
for both of us.

948
00:40:05.881 --> 00:40:08.144
- Oh. definitely.
- Good.

949
00:40:08.188 --> 00:40:09.494
- I mean. we get points
for just showing up.

950
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:11.104
- Mm-hmm.
- I saw your picture online.

951
00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:13.628
Same shirt. right?
Cute.

952
00:40:13.715 --> 00:40:15.891
I was like. "He'd be good
for a dry run."

953
00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:18.067
- I see.

954
00:40:18.154 --> 00:40:20.461
- So. a daughter.

955
00:40:20.548 --> 00:40:24.422
I did not picture my SSD guy
with a family.

956
00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:25.814
- Yeah?

957
00:40:25.858 --> 00:40:27.468
So you were picturing me.

958
00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:29.296
- Maybe.

959
00:40:29.383 --> 00:40:31.820
I'm a bit
of a mind reader myself.

960
00:40:31.907 --> 00:40:33.561
You deliver by day.

961
00:40:33.648 --> 00:40:35.476
By night. you dedicate yourself

962
00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:37.783
to a midnight rec center
b-ball league

963
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.220
for at-risk youth.

964
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:41.830
- Am I good at it?
- Oh. you're the best.

965
00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:43.441
I mean. you know
all the kids' names.

966
00:40:43.528 --> 00:40:45.834
plus the parents'--
it's a whole thing.

967
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:48.620
- That's actually not too far
from the truth.

968
00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:50.099
- Wait. really?

969
00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:51.840
- I'm a high-school principal.

970
00:40:51.927 --> 00:40:54.364
and I deliver
during the holidays.

971
00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:56.541
- Oh. well. you're better
than my principal.

972
00:40:56.584 --> 00:40:58.847
He smelled like BENGAY
and wore a back brace.

973
00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:01.676
- Mr. Carruthers
from Lakestone. yes.

974
00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:03.939
He's retired.
You ever hear from him?

975
00:41:04.026 --> 00:41:06.638
- No. but I don't really keep
track of school administrators

976
00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:08.291
who barred me from jazz band

977
00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:10.337
because I played
the French horn.

978
00:41:10.424 --> 00:41:12.905
- Ah. lady French horn player
who lives in Phoenix.

979
00:41:12.992 --> 00:41:15.821
Tell me more.

980
00:41:15.908 --> 00:41:18.040
All right. after Mr. Carruthers
derailed your music career.

981
00:41:18.127 --> 00:41:20.086
what happened next?

982
00:41:20.173 --> 00:41:22.175
- Well. plot-twist time.

983
00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:24.482
I'm first chair horn
for the Phoenix Symphony.

984
00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:29.356
- Ah. classical music. right?

985
00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:30.749
Not just...

986
00:41:30.836 --> 00:41:33.578
- What did you call it.
elevator music?

987
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:35.841
- I like a good elevator jam
now and then.

988
00:41:35.928 --> 00:41:37.320
- No. you're right.

989
00:41:37.407 --> 00:41:38.887
I mean. classical music
is pretty old-school.

990
00:41:38.974 --> 00:41:40.498
- Hey. vintage. antique.

991
00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:42.369
I just don't know
too much about it.

992
00:41:42.412 --> 00:41:44.980
but I'm willing to learn.

993
00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:47.940
Favorite Christmas song?

994
00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:50.420
- "Santa Claus Is Comin'
To Town." Bruce Springsteen.

995
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:52.684
- Didn't expect that.
Okay.

996
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:55.295
- You?

997
00:41:55.382 --> 00:41:58.298
- "Blue Christmas" by Elvis.

998
00:41:58.385 --> 00:42:00.126
- Classic.
- Yeah.

999
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:02.171
Impression?
- Oh. no. that wasn't good.

1000
00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:03.521
- No?
Come on.

1001
00:42:03.608 --> 00:42:05.392
A little bit?
- No. not very good. No.

1002
00:42:09.396 --> 00:42:11.093
I wasn't hungry.

1003
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.269
Now I'm thinking the coffee
might need a little company.

1004
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:15.315
- Yeah. I'm feeling
pretty wired. too.

1005
00:42:15.402 --> 00:42:16.925
- Are you sure it's not
just the amazing conversation

1006
00:42:17.012 --> 00:42:18.536
giving you butterflies?

1007
00:42:18.623 --> 00:42:20.059
I have that effect on people.

1008
00:42:20.146 --> 00:42:22.017
- I'm pretty sure
it's just the coffee.

1009
00:42:22.104 --> 00:42:24.542
Besides. this is just
a practice date. right?

1010
00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:26.108
- Right.

1011
00:42:26.152 --> 00:42:27.414
- You know.
we could've gone to Walt's.

1012
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:29.198
- My dad loves
that ice cream shop.

1013
00:42:29.285 --> 00:42:30.939
- Oh. every December.
he comes up

1014
00:42:31.026 --> 00:42:32.462
with these special
holiday flavors

1015
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.116
like Graham Cracker Truffle

1016
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.901
and White Chocolate
Irish Cream.

1017
00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:37.380
- Okay. you're making me
hungry.

1018
00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:38.860
- All right.
last year. he did

1019
00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:40.296
this Christmas Churro

1020
00:42:40.383 --> 00:42:41.471
with condensed milk
and. wait for it.

1021
00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.082
real cinnamon.

1022
00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:46.476
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1023
00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:48.609
- They have one that I love
this year

1024
00:42:48.696 --> 00:42:51.307
called Granny Smith...
Apple Pandowdy.

1025
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:54.049
- Come on.
that's my favorite. too.

1026
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.790
Walt's is the best. huh?

1027
00:42:55.834 --> 00:42:58.314
Noel?

1028
00:42:58.401 --> 00:43:00.012
- Dad.
Wow.

1029
00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:02.841
Uh. Charlotte and I were just

1030
00:43:02.928 --> 00:43:04.930
mailing the Christmas cards.

1031
00:43:05.017 --> 00:43:06.845
- Hi. I'm Sophie.

1032
00:43:06.932 --> 00:43:08.934
- Sophie.
this is my daughter. Noel.

1033
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:11.240
and her best friend. Charlotte.

1034
00:43:11.327 --> 00:43:13.155
- Nice to meet you.

1035
00:43:13.242 --> 00:43:16.419
- Sophie is
a professional musician.

1036
00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:20.293
and when Noel isn't spying on
people. she also enjoys music.

1037
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.687
- Really?
What. do you sing. play?

1038
00:43:22.774 --> 00:43:25.254
- Singing is my jam.
but I also play on bell choir.

1039
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:26.865
- But now she's late
for something I like to call.

1040
00:43:26.952 --> 00:43:29.041
"I know what you're doing.
Now go home."

1041
00:43:29.128 --> 00:43:30.912
- We've actually formed
an a cappella group

1042
00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:32.740
for our high school
for the Frosty Fest--

1043
00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:34.481
las Bocas Locas.

1044
00:43:34.568 --> 00:43:37.179
- Noel is super good.
- Stop.

1045
00:43:37.223 --> 00:43:38.703
- Well. it's time to study

1046
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:39.921
something you're not
super good at. ladies.

1047
00:43:40.008 --> 00:43:42.402
Bye. mi'ja.
Adiós. Charlotte.

1048
00:43:42.489 --> 00:43:44.491
- Well. Noel. if you ever want
to pick my brain.

1049
00:43:44.578 --> 00:43:46.667
I'm actually here

00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:57.945
and then the Bocas Locas
emerge from the bells. huh?

This is only our second one.
