00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:42.012
Or expressive.

126
00:06:42.012 --> 00:06:43.974

Sorry.
I kinda feel like that was my fault.

155
00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:04.301
No. no. no. no. Nath kinda seemed like
he needed the boost.

156
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.386
Plus. it's an investment.

I've gotta pay my dues.

241
00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:35.974
And paying my dues means
not paying my rent

242
00:11:35.974 --> 00:11:38.605
or being able to afford cute cocktails.

243
00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:42.445

"the" break-up. meaning it's fresh?

But we were goin' out for six years.

for a year and a bit though--

268

Did you wake up every day and lie there
trying to muster the energy to breathe?

269
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:51.542
No. 'Cause I finished with him.

270

and empowered afterwards. you know?

Il Giardino. There.

363

364
00:16:54.694 --> 00:16:56.447
No. Absolutely not.

365
00:16:56.447 --> 00:16:57.909

We'll go to Laser Quest.
merk some eight-year-olds.

367
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.334
Tempting. but I think it's actually
something I need to do.

368
00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:04.213
Like. I get what they did was peak.

369
00:17:04.213 --> 00:17:06.510

you know?

370
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.971
Like. not at all.

371
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:10.183
You're gonna let them off the hook
after how they treated you?

372
00:17:10.183 --> 00:17:12.855
Um. see. I don't think you're getting it.
This is part of the process.

373
00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:15.443
The process of you rolling over
like a bitch?

374
00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:18.157
Sorry. Too far.

375
00:17:18.157 --> 00:17:19.243
It's fine.

376
00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.003

in there with me. am I?

380
00:17:33.229 --> 00:17:34.941
Okay. Fair.

- They grow up. They change.
- Well. I didn't change.

I was talking about me.

00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:27.077
I mean. this whole thing came
as a surprise to me too. you know.

449
00:20:27.578 --> 00:20:32.755
Like. one day I woke up and I realised.
this just didn't make sense anymore.

450
00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:36.721
But this did.

451

the great conjunction happened--

00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:43.192
- I'm starting to think maybe this wasn't--
- Sorry.

454
00:20:43.192 --> 00:20:45.614
I was on a call with the New York office.
I was like. "I gotta go!"

455
00:20:45.614 --> 00:20:47.535
And they were like. "No!" [laughs]

456
00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:49.831
Anyway... [gasps] You must be Gia.

- You are...
- Yas. Dom's...

466
00:21:09.579 --> 00:21:12.626
Well. we're not really labelling it yet.
are we?

467
00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:15.173
But I guess we're just kind of
low-key fucking at the moment.

Uh. we're vibin'. so. you know...

469
00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:18.597

Not up.

473
00:21:24.232 --> 00:21:26.236
Um. I thought we agreed--

474
00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:29.451
I know what I said.
but I missed you. my sexy dumpling.

475

You guys don't mind. right?

476

- [clears throat] No.
- Mm-mmm.

477
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.087
No. I-- I love that you're here.

478
00:21:35.087 --> 00:21:38.385
Um. we actually ordered some bits
for the table. so help yourself.

479
00:21:38.385 --> 00:21:41.433
And try one of those croquette tings.
it'll make you cream.

480
00:21:41.935 --> 00:21:43.187

bub.

486
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.512
You guys heard of Nothin' But A G Thang?

487
00:21:59.512 --> 00:22:01.891
It's this fire hip-hop karaoke night.

488
00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:03.895
Me and my girls were there
a few nights back.

489
00:22:03.895 --> 00:22:07.778
And. you know. I was just chillin'.
fighting off an onslaught of dead guys.

490
00:22:07.778 --> 00:22:08.947
And just as I'm thinkin'.

491
00:22:08.947 --> 00:22:13.957
"Rah. there isn't a single decent guy
in this entire place." I hear...

492
00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:16.420
- We have Yas! Come on!
- [applause]

493
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.217
Turns out one of my girls put
my name down as a joke! [laughs]

494
00:22:19.217 --> 00:22:22.600
[emcee] How about
we have ourselves a little duet?

495
00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:32.327
And it was just this immediate.
deep. animal attraction.

496
00:22:32.327 --> 00:22:35.124
Palpable sexual energy crackling.
Everyone in the room could feel it.

497
00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:36.210
- [laughs]
- Really?

498
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.130
- Yeah.
- Yeah. really.

499
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.928
But. you know. calling it "a room"
makes it sound kinda small.

500
00:22:40.928 --> 00:22:44.434
[crowd cheering]

501
00:22:44.434 --> 00:22:48.442

this sea of people.

504
00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.834
- Like a mini concert.
- Mmm.

505

the crowd started chanting...</i>

00:30:16.588 --> 00:30:19.594
[Dom chuckles] Were you two living
together then before you... [clicks tongue]

684
00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:21.430
Uh. no. We weren't quite there yet.

685
00:30:21.932 --> 00:30:23.017
Makes it easier. I guess.

686
00:30:23.017 --> 00:30:25.188
Not having to chainsaw
the flat-screen in half.

687
00:30:25.188 --> 00:30:26.775
[clears throat] There's that.

688
00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:29.781
Plus. I doubt there'd be a lot of.
uh. bike rides

689
00:30:29.781 --> 00:30:31.618
and boiled eggs if I rocked up home.

690
00:30:31.618 --> 00:30:32.704
[Dom chuckles]

691
00:30:33.664 --> 00:30:34.666
[Yas grunts]

692
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.137
[instructor] Four...

693
00:30:41.137 --> 00:30:43.349
- [Yas] That will be me one day. man.
- Five...

694
00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:46.982
[Yas] Couple rich ex-husbands.
menstruation a distant memory.

695
00:30:46.982 --> 00:30:49.028
sat out in the park with both my legs
behind my head.

696
00:30:49.028 --> 00:30:50.447
It's just beautiful.

697
00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.284
[instructor] Three.

698
00:30:52.284 --> 00:30:53.494
[groans]

699
00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:55.833
- Four.
- [groaning]

700
00:30:57.127 --> 00:30:58.923
- [Dom] That will be me.
- Five.

701
00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:01.637
Old but still thirsty.

702
00:31:01.637 --> 00:31:03.097
[chuckles]

703
00:31:03.097 --> 00:31:04.183
[instructor] Six...

704
00:31:04.183 --> 00:31:05.268
[chuckles]

705
00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:08.066
- [sighs]
- [instructor] Change your legs.

706
00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:12.199
So. before the Eric stuff.
you had no idea you and Gia were done?

707
00:31:14.078 --> 00:31:16.625
Nope. Thought we were all set. [chuckles]

708
00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:18.671
[Yas] Really?

709
00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:20.423
There wasn't a single moment?

710
00:31:21.425 --> 00:31:24.348
A tiny crack in the beautiful pottery
that was you and her?

711
00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:28.899
I'm gonna need to think about that.

712
00:31:30.778 --> 00:31:32.114
You go first.

713
00:31:32.114 --> 00:31:34.368
When did you realise you
and your ex were done?

714
00:31:34.368 --> 00:31:38.585
Oh. There were probably a shitload
of alarm bells I was snoozing through.

715
00:31:38.585 --> 00:31:41.675
But if I had to pick a specific moment...

716
00:31:46.183 --> 00:31:47.352
He don't wave at boats.

717
00:31:47.854 --> 00:31:48.856
Say again?

718
00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:50.025
[passengers cheering]

719
00:31:50.025 --> 00:31:52.947
[Yas] <i>If people on a boat wave at you.
you have to wave back.</i>

720
00:31:52.947 --> 00:31:54.033
<i>It's the law.</i>

721
00:31:54.033 --> 00:31:56.538
Tourism funds sex trafficking.

722
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.542
Hmm.

723
00:31:59.627 --> 00:32:02.550
[ship horn blows]

724
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.763
[chuckles] What?

725
00:32:04.763 --> 00:32:07.852
So apparently there are two types
of people in this world.

726
00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:10.231
The ones who wave at boats

727
00:32:10.816 --> 00:32:12.152
and the ones who hate joy.

728
00:32:12.152 --> 00:32:13.572
Which one am I?

729
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.582
Haven't decided yet.

730
00:32:24.093 --> 00:32:28.101
Oh. so. I have thought about
my writing-on-the-wall moment.

731
00:32:28.644 --> 00:32:30.898
This still wakes me up at night cringin'.

732
00:32:30.898 --> 00:32:32.234
[Yas] Ooh. this gonna be good.

733
00:32:32.234 --> 00:32:33.319
[Dom sighs]

734
00:32:34.572 --> 00:32:41.377
Okay. um. so. a while back.
for our anniversary.

735
00:32:41.377 --> 00:32:43.131
I wanted to do something special.

736
00:32:44.466 --> 00:32:47.932
<i>So I booked the place we ended up at
on our first date.</i>

737
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:50.938
Can't believe
I filled in my eyebrows for this.

738
00:32:51.438 --> 00:32:53.151
- [Dom] <i>Late-night Morley's.</i>
- [vehicle passes]

739
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:55.405
<i>I thought it would be cute and romantic.</i>

740
00:32:55.405 --> 00:32:57.367
<i>A sweet little throwback...</i>

741
00:32:58.035 --> 00:32:59.204
[knocking]

742
00:32:59.204 --> 00:33:01.543
Hey-yo. boss man! I need chicken!

743
00:33:02.043 --> 00:33:03.462
[Dom] <i>...but apparently not.</i>

744
00:33:03.964 --> 00:33:05.843
Hey. you're a lucky girl. aren't you?

745
00:33:05.843 --> 00:33:07.930
[smoke alarm beeping]

746
00:33:08.765 --> 00:33:11.145
Anyway.
that was the last grand gesture I tried.

747
00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:13.984
Okay. I'm not even lyin'. yeah?

748
00:33:13.984 --> 00:33:16.071
That is literally my dream date.

749
00:33:16.071 --> 00:33:21.958
In fact. if I had a restaurant.
I'd call it "Nuggets by Candlelight".

750
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:23.461
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

751
00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:24.923
- No. but I'm not even joking.
- Loser.

752
00:33:24.923 --> 00:33:26.383
How could she not find that cute?

753
00:33:26.383 --> 00:33:27.553
I don't know.

754
00:33:27.553 --> 00:33:31.143
But that is my side of the story. innit?

755
00:33:31.143 --> 00:33:33.982
I bet Gia must have loads of
writin'-on-the-wall stories about me.

756
00:33:33.982 --> 00:33:36.237
And there you go again.
trying to share the blame.

757
00:33:36.237 --> 00:33:39.284
Well. I'm just saying.
what if they actually are meant to be?

758
00:33:39.786 --> 00:33:42.123
- Gia and Eric?
- Yeah.

759
00:33:42.123 --> 00:33:44.712
What if I'm the awkward hook-up story?

760
00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:48.762
A funny anecdote
in a future best man's speech?

761
00:33:49.973 --> 00:33:52.561
Wow. That is insanely forgiving.

762
00:33:53.855 --> 00:33:56.528
[clicks tongue] I know.
Maybe you've just inspired me.

763
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.241
How chill you are about your ex.

764
00:33:59.742 --> 00:34:01.453
Maybe it's time I tried that shit.

765
00:34:02.038 --> 00:34:06.881
[chuckles] Hey. Not everyone can be this.
uh. progressive. Takes talent.

766
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:08.885
[Yas laughs]

767
00:34:09.595 --> 00:34:12.183
So. you were a grand gesture guy. then?

768
00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:13.269
[Dom] Big time.

769
00:34:13.269 --> 00:34:15.231
I once hid chocolates
in my girlfriend's bed.

770
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:17.444
but they melted.
and she thought I shit myself.

771
00:34:17.444 --> 00:34:19.615
[Yas laughs]

772
00:34:20.116 --> 00:34:22.913
[Dom laughing]

773
00:34:22.913 --> 00:34:24.625
- I won't be doing that again.
- [Yas] Uh-huh.

774
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.721
[dog barking]

775
00:34:34.478 --> 00:34:35.731
We should go get a drink.

776
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.152
Definitely.

777
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:41.200
I'll make you miss your last train today.

778
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.285
Is it now?

779
00:34:42.285 --> 00:34:44.164
- Mm-hmm.
- [both chuckle]

780
00:34:44.164 --> 00:34:46.377
No. but seriously. I can't. [sighs]

781
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.466
But if you're havin' a good time.
you won't realise.

782
00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:51.178
If I miss it. it's a night bus.

783
00:34:51.178 --> 00:34:53.474
And if I'm lucky enough to survive that.
it's a taxi.

784
00:34:53.474 --> 00:34:55.019
Not an Uber. a taxi.

785
00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:58.819
Yeah. but sometimes you just gotta say.
"I'ma see what happens."

786
00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:01.908
Like. fuck it.
No plannin'. balls to the wall.

787
00:35:01.908 --> 00:35:03.620
just go where the breeze takes you.

788
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.956
"I'ma see what happens"?

789
00:35:04.956 --> 00:35:06.543
It's good for the soul. trust.

790
00:35:12.053 --> 00:35:13.055
So?

791
00:35:17.565 --> 00:35:18.567
I got time.

792
00:35:22.825 --> 00:35:25.288
Can I get a cranberry juice.
a pint of lager

793
00:35:25.288 --> 00:35:27.041
and a packet of salt and vinegar?

794
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.545
- [phone ringing]
- Thank you.

795
00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:30.716
- [dance music playing on stereo]
- [patrons chattering]

796
00:35:30.716 --> 00:35:31.801
Yas speaking.

797
00:35:31.801 --> 00:35:34.640
<i>Hey. this is Theresa from Upon Films.
The costume designer.</i>

798
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.934
Oh. hi.

799
00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:40.276
<i>Yeah. sorry to do this. but we're gonna
have to shift you back half an hour?</i>

800
00:35:40.276 --> 00:35:41.361
<i>Is that okay?</i>

801
00:35:42.615 --> 00:35:44.284
- You know what?
- [credit card machine beeps]

802
00:35:44.284 --> 00:35:46.581
- That actually doesn't work for me.
- Thank you.

803
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:47.792
Is it cool if I reschedule?

804
00:35:47.792 --> 00:35:51.298
<i>Yeah. actually.
we were hoping to make a decision today.</i>

805
00:35:51.298 --> 00:35:52.801
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Uh. okay.

806
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:54.555
- Love you. See you later. bye!
- <i>Yeah-- Uh--</i>

807
00:35:54.555 --> 00:35:55.891
- [chuckles. sighs]
- <i>Hello? Hello--</i>

808
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:57.728
- Who's that?
- Oh. that-that was Cass.

809
00:35:58.229 --> 00:35:59.231
How is she?

810
00:36:00.107 --> 00:36:01.820
Yeah. yeah. better.

811
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.155
Thank you.

812
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.286
Hey. I was. um. I was meaning to ask you.

813
00:36:06.286 --> 00:36:09.167
- Do you really recognise Eric from Tinder?
- Oh. [chuckles] No.

814
00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.506
But you just know he's still on there.
huntin'.

815
00:36:12.465 --> 00:36:14.177
I'm guessing you're not on the apps. no?

816
00:36:14.177 --> 00:36:15.639
Nah.

817
00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:17.893
It's Valentine's Day at primary school
all over again.

818
00:36:17.893 --> 00:36:19.814
Oh. wait. let me guess.

819
00:36:19.814 --> 00:36:21.776
Little Dom didn't get any cards.

820
00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:24.030
- No. But you know who did?
- [chuckles]

821
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.451
Lewis Younge. who had pubes at nine

822
00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:28.748
and would punch people
in the nuts for fun.

823
00:36:28.748 --> 00:36:30.669
Why are guys like that
always called Lewis? [laughs]

824
00:36:30.669 --> 00:36:31.754
I know. right?

825
00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:34.426
And now. everyone's only as good
as their profile pic.

826
00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:36.388
We're back to Lewis Younge
and his drawer full of cards.

827
00:36:36.388 --> 00:36:37.558
[inhales deeply]

828
00:36:37.558 --> 00:36:40.856
Oh! You still haven't told me
your break-up story.

829
00:36:40.856 --> 00:36:42.233
Uh. it really isn't that deep.

830
00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:45.031
No. no. You broke up with him
and didn't look back.

831
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.408
That's iconic.

832
00:36:46.408 --> 00:36:47.536
[retches. chuckles]

833
00:36:47.536 --> 00:36:50.584
- 'Ey. 'ey. 'ey.
- [Yas squeaks] Stop. Shut up. [laughs]

834
00:36:50.584 --> 00:36:52.546
No. also-- also. dude. you met my ex.

835
00:36:52.546 --> 00:36:54.967
Ah. oh. Okay. Fine.

836
00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.394
We broke up
because of A Tribe Called Quest.

837
00:37:01.396 --> 00:37:02.566
- [Yas's ex] Aw. fuck!
- Oh.

838
00:37:02.566 --> 00:37:04.277
Hey. babe. How's your day been?

839
00:37:04.277 --> 00:37:08.578
Mediocre with a sprinklin' of the entire
universe trying to fuck with me.

840
00:37:08.578 --> 00:37:10.039
Wait. wait. wait.

841
00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.208
Jules?

842
00:37:11.208 --> 00:37:12.795
Nathan's mate? The sculptor?

843
00:37:12.795 --> 00:37:13.880
That's your ex?

844
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.007
Oh. he doesn't just sculpt.

845
00:37:15.007 --> 00:37:17.303
He calls himself an artistic polymath.

846
00:37:17.303 --> 00:37:19.517
which is just another term
for being a cunt.

847
00:37:19.517 --> 00:37:21.311
- But. yeah. him.
- [chuckles]

848
00:37:21.311 --> 00:37:22.940
Things were getting kind of stale.

849
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.198
so I decided to try
and get things flowing again. you know?

850
00:37:27.198 --> 00:37:28.618
Reawaken the magic.

851
00:37:28.618 --> 00:37:29.704
Your breath.

852
00:37:30.914 --> 00:37:32.375
That will be the homemade hummus.

853
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:33.460
- Listen.

I heard you chattin'.

That was you in the toilet
back at Nathan's thing?

1083
00:47:54.744 --> 00:47:57.415
And that's why we're hanging out today.
'cause you felt sorry for me.

1084
00:47:57.415 --> 00:47:58.543
No.

1085
00:47:59.211 --> 00:48:00.213
Uh. kind of.

1088
00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:07.561

1089
00:48:07.561 --> 00:48:10.818
for a job doing costume
on a low-budget film.

1090
00:48:12.278 --> 00:48:13.949
I didn't know whether I wanted to go.

1091
00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:16.203
And then they called me to push it back.

1092
00:48:16.203 --> 00:48:18.290
and we were having such a nice time.
so I thought--

1093
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:19.711
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

since I finished my course.

for another no.

You know. for a lad you're not that into.
you do talk about him a lot. love.

1508
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.586
- No. I don't.
- You do.

1509
01:10:13.586 --> 01:10:15.213
- I don't.
- You do.

1510
01:10:15.213 --> 01:10:16.967
- [director] So. I was thinking.
- I don't.

1511
01:10:16.967 --> 01:10:18.888
She's just been through this huge battle.

1512
01:10:18.888 --> 01:10:20.808
but she's also been
through an internal battle.

1513
01:10:20.808 --> 01:10:21.894
Do I?

1514
01:10:21.894 --> 01:10:25.735
[director] You know. sort of figuring out
that this guy is actually pretty special.

1515
01:10:26.987 --> 01:10:30.953
This needs to be iconic.
It's the end of the movie.

1516
01:10:30.953 --> 01:10:35.420
He deserves. like.
some kind of grand gesture. you know?

1517
01:10:38.343 --> 01:10:40.263
["Blow You Away (Delilah)" playing]

1518
01:10:40.263 --> 01:10:44.313
We know more about Neptune
than we do about the human anus.

1519
01:10:44.313 --> 01:10:45.482
Yeah?

1520
01:10:45.482 --> 01:10:46.694
That's a fact.

1521
01:10:47.612 --> 01:10:51.411
Last night. I was at this soirée
with the white brother from <i>Twilight</i>.

1522
01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:52.496
Yeah.

1523
01:10:52.496 --> 01:10:56.170
He was telling me
my next ting should be toenails.

1524
01:10:57.089 --> 01:10:58.341
- Toenails?
- Yeah.

1525
01:11:06.107 --> 01:11:07.610
[breathes heavily]

1526
01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:10.616
[muttering]

1527
01:11:12.829 --> 01:11:14.666
[laughs]

1528
01:11:17.087 --> 01:11:18.173
You're such a knob.

1529
01:11:18.758 --> 01:11:20.218
[person in bathroom stall] Uh. sorry?

1530
01:11:20.218 --> 01:11:22.682
Sorry. not-- Sorry. not. just. uh...

1531
01:11:22.682 --> 01:11:25.228
Actually. not gonna do this again.
I'm leaving now.

1532
01:11:25.228 --> 01:11:27.316
[song continues]

1533
01:11:31.742 --> 01:11:32.744
Hey. babes.

1534
01:11:33.495 --> 01:11:35.415
I beg you. let me buy the hairy one.

1535
01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:37.879
- Not gonna happen. babe.
- Please.

1536
01:11:37.879 --> 01:11:39.633
- [Gia] Absolutely not.
- [Eric] Please.

1537
01:11:39.633 --> 01:11:40.676
[Gia] No.

1538
01:11:42.054 --> 01:11:44.141
That's mine. in case anyone was wondering.

1539
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:46.939
Nice.

1540
01:11:48.567 --> 01:11:50.028
It's okay. Dom. You can look.

1541
01:11:50.028 --> 01:11:51.824
Nah. I'm-- I'm cool.

1542
01:11:55.413 --> 01:11:56.792
- So--
- She's not here.

1543
01:11:58.086 --> 01:11:59.631
[Gia] What happened?

1544
01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:02.469
You and Yas were annoyingly perfect
for one another.

1545
01:12:02.469 --> 01:12:03.639
Mm-hmm.

1546
01:12:06.435 --> 01:12:08.189
I don't think either of us were ready.

1547
01:12:09.233 --> 01:12:13.032
And. um. I guess she still isn't.

1548
01:12:15.203 --> 01:12:16.289
[Eric] Oh. shit.

1549
01:12:16.289 --> 01:12:18.501
Babes.
they're bringin' out the new "canaps."

1550
01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.588
- Uh--
- Let's go.

1551
01:12:19.588 --> 01:12:22.134
Go. go. go. go. go.
go. go. go. go. go. go.

1552
01:12:22.134 --> 01:12:24.180
Go on. Go on.

1553
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.604
Just have a sneaky look.

1554
01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:28.689
No.

1555
01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:30.192
It'll cheer you up.

1556
01:12:30.192 --> 01:12:31.987
Mmm. I'm not looking at your bum.

1557
01:12:31.987 --> 01:12:33.908
It's got healing powers.

1558
01:12:33.908 --> 01:12:35.493
Leave me alone.

1559
01:12:40.503 --> 01:12:42.341
[Cass] That's mine. by the way.

1560
01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:44.763
[phone ringing]

1561
01:12:51.902 --> 01:12:54.365
- [Yas. on phone] <i>Uh. hey.</i>
- Hey.

1562
01:12:54.365 --> 01:12:57.580
[Yas] <i>Um. I was prayin'
that you weren't gonna pick up.</i>

1563
01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.793
Thought I'd be too busy
wanking away in my single bed?

1564
01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:03.759
[Yas groans] <i>Turns out. I was the wanker.</i>

1565
01:13:03.759 --> 01:13:05.972
<i>Um. a-are you at Nathan's show?</i>

1566
01:13:05.972 --> 01:13:08.226
Yeah. But you're not.

1567
01:13:08.226 --> 01:13:10.564
[Yas] <i>Actually. I should be by any second.</i>

1568
01:13:10.564 --> 01:13:12.819
Oh. cool. It'd be good to see you.

1569
01:13:12.819 --> 01:13:14.154
- Cheers.
- [Yas] <i>Yeah?</i>

1570
01:13:15.198 --> 01:13:16.492
<i>Turn around.</i>

1571
01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:19.498
[Yas chuckles]

1572
01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:21.545
<i>That's you. right?</i>

1573
01:13:21.545 --> 01:13:23.841
[ship horn blows]

1574
01:13:23.841 --> 01:13:25.385
[Yas chuckles]

1575
01:13:25.385 --> 01:13:27.472
[ship horn blows]

1576
01:13:27.472 --> 01:13:29.686
[Yas laughs] <i>I knew you were a boat waver!</i>

1577
01:13:29.686 --> 01:13:32.149
Wait. is that you?

1578
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:33.234
Yeah.

1579
01:13:35.573 --> 01:13:38.161
What are you doin'? You're miles away.

1580
01:13:38.161 --> 01:13:39.539
[Yas] <i>Come down and meet me.</i>

1581
01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.962
[ship horn blows]

1582
01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:45.926
Please?

1583
01:13:50.101 --> 01:13:53.191
Listen. I'm really sorry
for all the shit I said. I was a dick.

1584
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:55.278
I was being overly sensitive.

1585
01:13:55.278 --> 01:13:58.577
Can you stop being nice? Please.
I'm trying to explain.

1586
01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:04.046
The thing is.
that day at Nathan's thing. I just--

1587
01:14:04.631 --> 01:14:06.510
I didn't wanna be sad anymore.

1588
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.806
And so. I lied.

1589
01:14:09.808 --> 01:14:11.895
And then you called me iconic.

1590
01:14:12.396 --> 01:14:15.360
And I liked that you saw me that way.
so I kept on lyin'.

1591
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.994
Come on. It wouldn't have mattered.
I'd think you were cool either way.

1592
01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:21.080
- [Yas] <i>Yeah.</i>
- [Dom chuckles]

1593
01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.750
I know that now.

1594
01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:26.090
[Dom. on phone] <i>Maybe we can start over.</i>

1595
01:14:27.425 --> 01:14:31.518
Yas! Wait. Where you going? Yas! Wait!

1596
01:14:31.518 --> 01:14:33.271
I'm on a fucking boat!

1597
01:14:33.271 --> 01:14:34.691
[Dom laughs]

1598
01:14:34.691 --> 01:14:35.818
[chuckles] Sorry. Sorry.

1599
01:14:35.818 --> 01:14:38.030
Why are you on a fucking boat?

1600
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:41.245
'Cause I figured you deserve
the grand gestures for once. bub.

1601
01:14:41.245 --> 01:14:42.832
- [laughs]
- [Yas laughs]

1602
01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:45.003
What's happening?

1603
01:14:45.003 --> 01:14:49.303
Right. Yeah. I didn't-- I didn't actually
check what route this is taking. so--

1604
01:14:49.303 --> 01:14:50.931
Stay where you are. I'm comin'. okay?

1605
01:14:50.931 --> 01:14:52.685
[Yas] <i>I don't really have a choice.</i>

1606
01:14:53.186 --> 01:14:56.275
And just so you know.
I still think you're iconic. [laughs]

1607
01:14:56.275 --> 01:14:57.402
I'm coming. Captain!

1608
01:14:57.402 --> 01:14:59.406
- [laughs]
- [Yas laughs]

1609
01:15:06.212 --> 01:15:07.380

1610
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:20.574
Where are--

1611
01:15:36.105 --> 01:15:38.192
- [chuckles]
- [Yas chuckles]

1612
01:15:41.825 --> 01:15:42.827
Hey.

1613
01:15:43.829 --> 01:15:44.872
Hey.

1614
01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:48.797
So...

1615
01:15:52.262 --> 01:15:54.224
- Do you wanna-- [chuckles]
- Do you fancy-- No. [chuckles]

1616
01:15:54.224 --> 01:15:56.521
You-- You go.

1617
01:15:58.399 --> 01:15:59.902
I was just gonna say. do you wanna--

1618
01:16:10.298 --> 01:16:11.342
[Dom] Go ahead.

1619
01:16:13.137 --> 01:16:15.391
I was just gonna say...

1620
01:16:16.393 --> 01:16:18.147
Do you wanna go for a stroll?

1621
01:16:19.399 --> 01:16:20.694
Yeah.

1622
01:16:20.694 --> 01:16:24.409
But you do have to make
the last train though. right?

1623
01:16:27.248 --> 01:16:28.250
Nah.

1624
01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:31.090
I'ma see what happens.

1625
01:16:49.544 --> 01:16:52.758
