I don't know if you guys have heard
that theory...

21
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.516
...that if you want something
with all the desire in the world.

22
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.436
the universe conspires to give it to you.

23
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:06.979
Have you heard it?

24
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.691
Well. this is dumb.

25
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.484
If that was true.

26
00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:18.240
Mexico would've won a World Cup a long
time ago. and cellulitis wouldn't exist.

27
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.787
But wishing is not enough.
You have to create it.

28
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.501
This place is packed.

29
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.087
I told you the bar was gonna be a hit.
partners.

30
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.549
"Partner" until you pay
your share of the bar.

31
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.677
It's my dad. he already sent me
a photo of the transfer.

32
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.556
But for some reason it's not in
my account yet. You know how banks are.

33
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.058
I already know
how you are.

34
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.559
You've been saying for six months

35
00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:48.687
that your dad will send you the money.
and it doesn't happen.

36
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:49.897
It hasn't been six months.

37
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.358
Yes. baby. it's been six months.

38
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:56.028
Well. but...
Six very successful months. right?

39
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:01.033
The thing is you haven't done
what you said. aren't you ashamed?

40
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.201
No.

41
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.202
I'm not.

42
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:08.290
It's a shame that cutie is alone
right there.

43
00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:09.667
Who is he?

44
00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:12.586
I've had better.

45
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.131
No way. girl.
He's totally out of our league.

46
00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:18.676
I've been with models.

47
00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.971
Cheap models I bet. I've never seen you
with someone like that.

48
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.307
Sure. don't you remember the...?

49
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.560
-Okay. show us some photos.
-Photos of what?

50
00:04:28.644 --> 00:04:31.105
-You take pictures of everything.
-No.

51
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:34.858
Oh. baby. for God's sake.
your whole life is on social media.

52
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.112
Or at least what they think my life is.

53
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.281
They say. "If life gives you lemons.
make lemonade."

54
00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:43.117
To hell with lemonade.

55
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.536
-Are you going to take them?
-No.

56
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:48.288
I want a cocktail with champagne.

57
00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.628
And if life gives me tepache.
I fake the bubbles...

58
00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:57.756
until it turns to champagne.

59
00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.598
Because to become the person you want

60
00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:07.725
HELLO - DREAM BIG

61
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.185
you have to look the part first.

62
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.438
Americans call it:

63
00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.776
Fake it until you make it.

64
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.570
And I have achieved it.

65
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:31.957
So. why are there no photos
of your models on your social media?

66
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.878
Because that's
what my private life is. It's private.

67
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:37.629
Oh. yes. of course.

68
00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:43.177
-I've never lied.
-Lu.

69
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.138
I wouldn't lie. I've had guys like that
and a thousand times better.

70
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.767
I bet you whatever you want that
I can make this guy fall in love with me.

71
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:51.643
Anything we want?

72
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.228
Anything.

73
00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.565
-How about your share of the bar?
-What are you talking about?

74
00:05:56.648 --> 00:06:00.277
Yes. if the boy falls in love with Lu.
she will no longer have to pay anything.

75
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.573
But if she can't make it. she won't be
a partner anymore and will work for us.

76
00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:10.621
It's the moment of truth. Penalty kick!
They're leaving everything on the pitch.

77
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:11.997
Deal.

78
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.292
Deal.

79
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:27.179
How long did we have until the wedding?
How could you leave me hanging like this?

80
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:31.225
It's like you're standing me up
at our wedding.

81
00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:35.395
And you don't even have the guts
to answer the messages. the calls.

82
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:37.981
-You know what?
-What?

83
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.943
-Go fuck yourself.
-Me?

84
00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:46.990
Who are you? Bring me the check.
I want to go to the hotel.

85
00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:49.660
Are you leaving? No. No.

86
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.495
The match is not over yet.

87
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:55.499
Argentina versus México. are you kidding?
That's not a football game. Please.

88
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.838
Well. Mexico just scored another goal
and now we are winning.

89
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:05.634
We are going to catch them in the rematch
and give them what they deserve.

90
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.970
As always.
Bring me the check. I want to go.

91
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.013
No. because today is a lucky day.

92
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:13.475
I'm one of the owners here.
So the next drink is on me.

93
00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:18.939
I'm one of the 15 best bartenders
in Mexico.

94
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.817
I have some cocktails that will blow
your mind. Tequila. mezcal.

95
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.070
-Tequila. Bring me a tequila.
-Tequila.

96
00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:27.990
But put that juice... What's it called?
Grape? Fruit?

97
00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:31.034
-Grapefruit?
-That's it. grapefruit.

98
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:36.582
Would you like to take a look at the menu.
just in case you want to eat something?

99
00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:42.004
I already did. and honestly. it looks
like shit. It's like a menu for cows.

100
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.339
No. this menu was designed by me.

101
00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:48.010
Yes. I've been a vegetarian
for eight years.

102
00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:52.639
Your Argentine accent is amazing.

103
00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:55.642
Here's your drink.

104
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.186
The check.

105
00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:02.649
How's it going with your drunk friend?

106
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:06.195
We already talked about the match.
menu recommendations...

107
00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.948
And he said something
about taking my clothes off.

108
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.744
I know. my plan is working.

109
00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.413
Better think of a plan B.
because plan A is slipping away.

110
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:22.669
No. I came to tell you that we're leaving.
Girls. you tend the bar.

111
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.298
Are you okay?

112
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:29.676
Are you okay?

113
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.595
Everything is fine.

114
00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:34.806
Did you hurt yourself?

115
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.518
Because slips are the leading cause
of death among Argentines.

116
00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:41.188
Because they're always
on their high horses.

117
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.857
and whenever they get distracted. boom...

118
00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:48.528
they fall back to reality
and the fall is deadly.

119
00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:54.201
So. you're a waitress. a vegetarian.
and a comedian. Good. huh?

120
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.661
-Wow!
-Careful. careful.

121
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:59.498
-Oh. what a nice wind.
-No stairs. we'll use the ramp.

122
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.751
-Thank you. Thank you. waitress.
-Of course.

123
00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.670
I am not a waitress.

124
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:09.091
I'm an owner of this bar and I'm one
of the ten best bartenders in Mexico.

125
00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.469
-Ten?
-Yes.

126
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:16.556
In there. you told me 15.
What happened? Did you kill five of them?

127
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.310
No. I said that just to see
if you were paying attention.

128
00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.939
It's very cold. isn't it?

129
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.317
Thank you.

130
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:34.408
So what are you. eh?
Are you a fashion model?

131
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:36.535
Are you fucking with me?

132
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.621
-No.
-I own a bookstore.

133
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:45.460
Don't you want to take advantage
of this good lighting?

134
00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:48.046
Look. Look how pretty the city looks.

135
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:52.926
-What are you doing?
-I'm just taking a picture.

136
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.473
-With a kiss?
-Don't you like women?

137
00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:08.442
I like women.
I love them. But I don't like you.

138
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:15.073
The Argentines believe
that they were born from gods.

139
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.706
-You're jealous.
-I'm not jealous.

140
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.544
It's just that you're really hot.
Really hot.

141
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.088
But if the lights went out.
who would you impress?

142
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:35.594
Who do I have to impress? Who? You?

143
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.390
I would if I liked you.

144
00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:51.943
No.

145
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.155
-It's here.
-Okay.

146
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.615
Yes. It's here.

147
00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.117
No.

148
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.913
That way.

149
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.959
Mexico controls the ball
but Argentina...

150
00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:12.506
Mexico!

151
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.257
And the shot... very close!

152
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:17.511
Yes.

153
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.428
Don't move.

154
00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:22.599
Hey.

155
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.768
My name is Lu.

156
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:26.812
Yes.

157
00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.356
-Diego.
-Nice to meet you.

158
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.234
It is here.

159
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.152
-It is here.
-Give me your key.

160
00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:35.445
Take it. take it.

161
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:41.451
This is a credit card.

162
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.292
-Okay.
-Here we go.

163
00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.045
-Just a little.
-It's nice.

164
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.842
DO NOT DISTURB

165
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.193
Diego.

166
00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.368
Diego.

167
00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:39.676
Diego.

168
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.809
-Hello.
-Good morning.

169
00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:51.396
-Where do I leave your breakfast?
-I didn't order breakfast.

170
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.648
Mr. Diego ordered it.

171
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:59.279
Yes? Did he order it for me?
Do I have to pay?

172
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.740
-No. it's already paid.
-You can come in.

173
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.536
He remembered I'm a vegetarian.

174
00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.260
-Would you like me to serve you coffee?
-Yes. please.

175
00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.142
Diego Quiroga.

176
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.536
Details to fall in love for.

Hashtag "vegetarian breakfast."

178
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:56.336
Hashtag "couple life."

179
00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.508
THE WHOLE OF YOU COMES TO MEET ME
AND FOR A MOMENT WE BOTH DISAPPEAR

180
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:07.347
The whole of you comes to meet me
And for a moment we both disappear

181
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:10.725
How cute.

182
00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:15.689
Right? And thoughtful.
The breakfast thing was amazing.

183
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.274
Yes. Partners?

184
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:22.362
No. not partners. You slept with the guy.
so what? He was very drunk.

185
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.781
No. he wasn't that drunk.

186
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.783
otherwise he wouldn't have done
all he did.

187
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.244
-What did he do to you?
-Tatiana.

188
00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.039
Do you have evidence?

189
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.167
According to yesterday's bet.
I'm officially a member.

190
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.838
I said "make him fall in love with you".
not sleep with him.

191
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.506
Yes. girl. Fer said "fall in love".

192
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.925
He is very much in love. he even cried.

193
00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.469
-Did he cry?
-He cried when I left.

194
00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.598
But he had to return to Argentina. so...

195
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:53.643
If he is very much in love.
he will surely come back for you.

196
00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.688
Then we'll see if you won the bet.

197
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.442
What if he doesn't come back?

198
00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.153
It means that it was only
a one-night stand.

199
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:07.157
Yes. friend. technically
it would be a one-night stand.

200
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.491
And the bet?

201
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.535
Then you would have lost it.

202
00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:14.289
There are many reasons
why he can't come. He's very far.

203
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:18.793
So. he would do anything
for you to go there. right? It's love.

204
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:24.049
-He told me to go. in the note.
-That note has no address.

205
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.092
He left me this note...

206
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.013
with an address.

207
00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:36.895
Lu. if he really wanted for you to go.
he would have left you a ticket.

208
00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.065
And so he did. obviously.

209
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:46.071
But what would I go there for?
I can't leave you guys on your own.

210
00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:49.783
Girl. my dad has a cousin
who lives in Argentina.

211
00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:53.328
He worked as an actor.
portraying a villain.

212
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.790
He's a little weird.
but I'm going to give you his number.

213
00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.209
Lu is not going.

214
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:03.755
How is she not going? He is handsome
and he left a ticket for her.

215
00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.341
He didn't leave her anything.
It was just a one-night stand.

216
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.219
You're so bad.

217
00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:12.681
Okay.

218
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.895
I'll go to Argentina. with the ticket he
bought me. because he's in love with me.

219
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.022
So you know I won the bet
and I'm a partner.

220
00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:26.361
Tequila.

221
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.822
Take care of the bar.

222
00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.575
Girl. write to my dad's cousin.

223
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.869
-I'll send you his contact info.
-Okay.

224
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.581
What a thrill! It's like a romantic movie.

225
00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.793
One that could be called
International Harassment.

226
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.050
It's not enough.

227
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.094
Is there something else I can do?

228
00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.475
Maybe if you do some layovers.

229
00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:01.312
Yes. I will do what is necessary.

230
00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:03.314
-Passport.
-Sure.

231
00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.404
First time abroad.

232
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:14.868
Yes.

233
00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:39.768
27 HOURS LATER

234
00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.208
TATI'S FRIEND

235
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.383
-Tona?
-Do you want an autograph?

236
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.469
Take this.

237
00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:21.017
What? What does your sign say?
"Tati's friend".

238
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.769
I'm Tati's friend.

239
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.525
Sorry. My brain is an artistic volcano.

240
00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:33.655
And inside of it.
the spaces of creation converge...

241
00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.616
along with passion and action.

242
00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.746
Come on. I'll help you.

243
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.053
Thanks.

244
00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:02.308
What? Something happened?

245
00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.270
I have to go through here.
because the other door is stuck.

246
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.938
Okay.

247
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.898
-Thank you.
-Of course.

248
00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:23.496
My name is Lu.

249
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.875
Your name seems oriental.

250
00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:31.212
No. it's Lu from "Guadalupe".
"Lupita." Lu.

251
00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.756
I am Tona.

252
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.092
Tonatiuh.

253
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.937
-Where are we going?
-Of course. Sorry.

254
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:52.525
Here.

255
00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.366
-Give me my glasses. they're in there.
-Here?

256
00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.083
Let me see.

257
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.088
-He's handsome. right?
-Tona!

258
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.761
Don't worry. child.

259
00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:27.644
Everyone drives horribly here.
They drive like they talk.

260
00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.147
Hey. did you come here just for him?

261
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.234
No. I didn't come just for him.
I came for tourism.

262
00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:43.743
You met one night. had wild sex.

263
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:46.162
and traveled to the end of the world...

264
00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.957
just to conquer it.

265
00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:53.962
How did you do that?

266
00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.007
Tatiana told me.

267
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:02.428
Tona!
I swear. for a second I believed you.

268
00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:07.308
No. you didn't believe me.
You lived it with me.

269
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.687
Because I'm an actor.

270
00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.347
Whatever you need. let me know.

271
00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:48.975
Good luck.

272
00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:51.519
Thanks. Tona.

273
00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:32.226
We are about to close.

274
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.897
I'm looking for Diego... Diego Quiroga.

275
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:40.026
-Professional or personal matters?
-Personal.

276
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:44.155
-Up the stairs.
-Thanks.

277
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:59.253
Diego. how are you?
I'm not here just for you. Of course not.

278
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:03.049
Your wallet was one of the reasons.

279
00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:06.427
Would you like to show me Argentina.
as a thank-you gift?

280
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.144
Fake it until you make it.

281
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:26.155
Diego.

282
00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:31.702
Diego?

283
00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:36.624
Hello?

284
00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:42.046
Diego.

285
00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:52.390
-Why are you naked in a bookstore?
-What? No. This is my home.

286
00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.559
Well. it's not like
I haven't seen this before.

287
00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:56.185
What are you doing here?

288
00:23:56.269 --> 00:24:00.148
No... I asked for you and a kind granny
told me to go up the stairs and that's it.

289
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:02.525
Your face looks familiar to me.
Do we know each other?

290
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:03.442
Yes.

291
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.944
-Your name is?
-Lu.

292
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:07.071
-Lu?
-Yes.

293
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:08.823
-The Mexican.
-Yes.

294
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:12.326
-The waitress. the vegan. the comedian?
-No. vegetarian and owner.

295
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.162
But what are you doing here?

296
00:24:14.996 --> 00:24:17.165
I... I brought your wallet.

297
00:24:17.248 --> 00:24:18.708
You came just to bring the wallet.

298
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:20.835
-all the way from Mexico?
-Obviously not.

299
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:23.963
You're not a psychopath who falls in love
after a one-night stand?

300
00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:26.132
-Tell me you didn't come just for that.
-I didn't.

301
00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:27.592
-No? Do you swear?
-No.

302
00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:30.011
I brought you... I brought you a tequila.

303
00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:32.680
You came here for one night of sex.

304
00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:36.934
-One night of what?
-Of sex. Leave this there or take it.

305
00:24:37.018 --> 00:24:39.395
-There's the door. Leave it there.
-No. I didn't...

306
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:41.814
Hey. I didn't come for a night of sex.

307
00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:45.943
Okay. No. It was because of the chemistry.

308
00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:47.445
No? Also. I...

309
00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:53.159
No. What happened is that...

310
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:58.247
I'm not one of those crazy people
who create stories in their head.

311
00:24:58.331 --> 00:25:02.501
I thought you...
Because you left me those notes.

312
00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:06.422
-What notes are you talking about?
-With the vegetarian breakfast.

313
00:25:07.048 --> 00:25:09.550
The breakfast was included at the hotel.

314
00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:10.927
But not a vegetarian one.

315
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.096
Vegetarian?
It's called a continental breakfast.

316
00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:18.601
-But what about the rose?
-It was part of the decoration.

317
00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:21.103
Did you eat it because you are vegan?

318
00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:23.773
I didn't eat it. because I'm a vegetarian.

319
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:27.693
What can you tell me about this?

320
00:25:27.777 --> 00:25:31.239
-I don't know what that is.
-This is what you wrote me.

321
00:25:31.322 --> 00:25:34.659
"The whole of you comes to meet me
And for a moment we both disappear"

322
00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:38.621
-It's a poem.
-I know. from Sabines. I love it.

323
00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:40.581
You wrote it. asking me to come.

324
00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:44.418
I write poems to make bookmarks.
for the bookstore.

325
00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:48.631
Look...

326
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:55.012
There.

327
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:03.771
Diego. give me three days.

328
00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:06.691
If you get to know me.
you will fall in love with me.

329
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:08.901
-Five.
-Five?

330
00:26:09.527 --> 00:26:12.780
This way we get to know each other better
and we can take more photos.

331
00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:14.740
Four.

332
00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:18.202
-You wouldn't dare.
-No?

333
00:26:18.286 --> 00:26:20.788
-I came to the end of the world. Diego.
-Three.

334
00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:25.126
Just so you know. I faked my orgasm.

335
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:26.377
Oh. my God. all four?

336
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.920
-It was three.
-Two.

337
00:26:28.004 --> 00:26:29.171
It was three.

338
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:35.136
Your mom is calling you. Why don't you
take the call? I'm gonna stay here.

339
00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:36.679
No.

340
00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:40.599
Maybe she left you a message. Check it.
Maybe you'll change your mind.

341
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.269
One. Bye.

342
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:46.480
Out.

343
00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:52.153
Good evening. Police station.

344
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:55.823
Hello. I dialed by mistake.
but everything is in order.

345
00:26:57.283 --> 00:26:58.576
Oh. God...

346
00:27:00.036 --> 00:27:02.663
Oh. God...

347
00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:05.458
The self-improvement books
are in aisle three.

348
00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:27.897
Diana. a few moments ago.
a girl came up to my house.

349
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:33.652
A crazy one. Don't let anyone go up to
my house. It is not part of the bookstore.

350
00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.363
-Please.
-Of course.

351
00:27:36.197 --> 00:27:37.031
Okay.

352
00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:41.118
You can go.
I will close the bookstore.

353
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:46.123
Hi. Mom. listen to me.

354
00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:51.712
If you're calling to apologize for not
being able to come to the wedding...

355
00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:55.633
Why should I apologize
for a mistake you're about to make?

356
00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:58.469
Will you let me explain?

357
00:27:58.552 --> 00:28:00.262
What do you want to explain to me?

358
00:28:00.346 --> 00:28:03.265
You get excited and then you give it up.

359
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:05.476
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
TELL US EVERYTHING

360
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.621
Diego. remember
when you saw a photo exhibit.

361
00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:29.375
you loved it and you set up a studio.
hiring many people.

362
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:33.504
Then you saw a TV show
and bought a food truck.

363
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:36.424
Then you wanted to be a yoga teacher.

364
00:28:36.507 --> 00:28:40.177
a diver. and you abandoned everything.

365
00:28:41.178 --> 00:28:47.143
But tell me. when did you meet this girl?
That's what matters most to me.

366
00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:51.564
Eight months ago. Well. a little less.

367
00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:56.861
Do you realize that is crazy?
In three months. the problems will begin.

368
00:28:56.944 --> 00:28:57.778
LIBRARY EL SUR

369
00:28:57.862 --> 00:29:00.030
You will not know how to solve them.
the woman will get tired.

370
00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:04.410
and you will end up crying.
drunk. in a seedy bar.

371
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:10.374
You know what? You're wrong.

372
00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:12.251
I'm going to get married.

373
00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:16.505
then I'm going to be a father
and you'll have grandchildren.

374
00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:20.134
Just so you know.
I'm going out to dinner right now

375
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:24.430
with the love of my life to celebrate
the fact that we love each other deeply.

376
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:28.142
Are you both at the bookstore?
I'm on my way.

377
00:29:30.895 --> 00:29:31.937
Are you in Buenos Aires?

378
00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:35.774
Of course.
I'm five blocks from the bookstore.

379
00:29:35.858 --> 00:29:39.403
I came to meet my future daughter-in-law.

380
00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:44.700
I'm not going to stay for the wedding.
Don't wanna see your asshole of a father.

381
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:46.035
I'll see you soon.

382
00:29:50.372 --> 00:29:51.332
Hey!

383
00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:52.500
Waitress!

384
00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:55.920
Vegan. Mexican!

385
00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:58.923
Hey! Stop. please stop.

386
00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:02.092
-Leave me alone. I'm leaving.
-I know. I'm sorry.

387
00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:06.222
-I was rude. don't go. I need your help.
-Yes.

388
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:10.100
-About what?
-A lady will arrive. elegantly dressed.

389
00:30:10.184 --> 00:30:12.770
in her sixties. My mom.

390
00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:15.022
I need you to pretend something
for me. Please.

391
00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:18.067
-Pretend?
-Yes. That you are my girlfriend.

392
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.778
Look who's getting ideas in his head.
You are wrong.

393
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:23.239
-No. no. wait. please.
-No.

394
00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:26.700
You are my Argentine girlfriend.
and we are getting married in three days.

395
00:30:26.784 --> 00:30:28.327
-You and I are getting married?
-Yes.

396
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:29.828
Okay. Get on your knees.

397
00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:32.373
-Yes
-Yes.

398
00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:34.041
-Please...
-Just kidding. Diego. stop.

399
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:36.835
Pretend you're Argentine.
you do the accent very well.

400
00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:40.548
If she asks you something.
you just say "okay"

401
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.550
-or "gorgeous."
-Gorgeous.

402
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:47.846
No. it's better you don't talk.
It's... It's that one.

403
00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:51.225
Try not to talk
because she doesn't like Mexicans.

404
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.561
-Why does she hate Mexicans?
-Ma.

405
00:30:56.939 --> 00:31:00.693
Did you want to meet her?
Here she is. Lu. Lucía.

406
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.947
It's a pleasure to meet you. Lucía.

407
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:11.328
We canceled dinner. Mom. we're too tired.

408
00:31:11.412 --> 00:31:14.290
Tell me which hotel you are staying at
and tomorrow I'll visit you

409
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:16.041
and we can chat and...

410
00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:18.127
I'm hungry.

411
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:20.504
Me too.

412
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.299
Gorgeous.

413
00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:28.137
-Hi. son.
-Nice to see you.

414
00:31:29.013 --> 00:31:29.888
Hello.

415
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:37.605
Let's go to dinner. Yes.

416
00:31:37.688 --> 00:31:41.817
I will close the bookstore.
drop the suitcase off and we can go.

417
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.527
Where did you get that suitcase?

418
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:52.494
We found it in the street. and I was going
to keep it in case the owner came back.

419
00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:56.415
You're crazy. that suitcase stays here.

420
00:31:56.498 --> 00:32:00.002
You don't know what's inside.
the suitcase stays here.

421
00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:02.755
-She's right.
-It stays here?

422
00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:04.506
-Yes. we have to leave it.
-It stays.

423
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.844
-Okay.
-Yes?

424
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:12.181
Come on! What's happening?
You seem like a couple of fools. Let's go.

425
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.025
Is your mom always like this?
She makes me nervous.

426
00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:24.568
Yes. Let's go.

427
00:32:26.612 --> 00:32:31.116
Mrs. Martina. good evening.
your table is ready.

428
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.409
Thank you very much.

429
00:32:34.203 --> 00:32:36.288
I'm also going to show you
some cuts of meat...

430
00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:42.836
I'm sorry about the suitcase. I'm going
to replace everything you had inside.

431
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.798
You better. because inside I had Chanel.

432
00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:49.677
-Gucci. Christian Dior. and Prada. and...
-Well. I'm just asking...

433
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:52.179
that you pretend to be Argentine.

434
00:32:52.262 --> 00:32:54.515
Tell me. silly. why does
she hate Mexicans so much?

435
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.642
The story is long but to give you an idea.

436
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:59.645
when I was a kid. I wasn't allowed
to watch El Chavo del 8.

437
00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:01.188
I mean. that's not normal.

438
00:33:02.064 --> 00:33:05.943
She hates Christian Castro.
Verónica Castro. Ricardo Arjona.

439
00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:09.738
-Arjona is from Guatemala.
-Well. for her. they are all Mexican.

440
00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.865
What is her problem?

441
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.617
-Do we live together?
-No.

442
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:16.120
-How long have we been together?
-Eight months.

443
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:19.081
Guys. let's eat some meat. Come on.

444
00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:22.418
You shouldn't talk too much.
so she doesn't notice your accent.

445
00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:25.838
-I don't know what you mean.
-You better not talk.

446
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:32.845
This menu is like Noah's Ark.

447
00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:38.225
-Do you want me to give you more time?
-No. we're ready to order.

448
00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:41.770
Chitterlings. well-done gizzards.

449
00:33:42.104 --> 00:33:48.026
Later we will eat ribeye.
flank steak and rare steak

450
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.238
-with blood. lots of blood.
-Lots of blood.

451
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:52.865
Please. you know me.

452
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.869
In my family. eating meat
is like a religion.

453
00:33:56.952 --> 00:33:59.455
In fact. my mother's family members

454
00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.290
were devoted to it all their lives.

455
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:02.958
To religion?

456
00:34:03.876 --> 00:34:07.004
-To the farm. little girl.
-Anything else?

457
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:10.340
Yes. Three still waters. please.

458
00:34:10.424 --> 00:34:13.719
-I...
-No bubbles. and the usual wine.

459
00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:15.387
Can I order something?

460
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:18.098
-Of course.
-A salad...

461
00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:20.851
with green spinach. anything green.

462
00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:21.852
Of course.

463
00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:24.730
It's just that I don't eat meat
for dinner. It's too heavy.

464
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:27.649
But today you're going to do it.
you can't let me down.

465
00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:29.610
-Okay...
-Excuse me.

466
00:34:32.196 --> 00:34:34.364
-What wine did I order?
-The usual.

467
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:37.159
Can you go check. please?

468
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:42.247
No. but I'm sure you asked for the usual.

469
00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:43.791
Go check it.

470
00:34:51.882 --> 00:34:54.802
You must think that my age
affects my lucidity. right?

471
00:34:55.677 --> 00:34:57.679
To be honest.
I don't know much about medicine.

472
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.934
You are very funny. right?
Look me in the eyes.

473
00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:09.733
I believe that we are all the same.
no matter our age or where we came from.

474
00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:13.403
I was just thinking
about where you're from.

475
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:18.075
And looking at you
I realize that you are...

476
00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:21.829
a very humble girl.

477
00:35:22.788 --> 00:35:25.749
You've been dating for eight months.
and will get married?

478
00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:29.044
What are you looking for?

479
00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:33.131
Love.

480
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:38.136
Look. Diego is my only son and he is going
to inherit a cattle empire.

481
00:35:38.762 --> 00:35:41.473
And you know that.

482
00:35:41.557 --> 00:35:46.645
No. I didn't know anything.
Now I know because you keep saying it.

483
00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:47.938
Sorry?

484
00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:55.904
Where is the wine?
It's taking a long time. don't you think?

485
00:35:56.697 --> 00:36:00.033
There is something about you
that I don't like.

486
00:36:03.245 --> 00:36:04.621
It must be my eyebrows.

487
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:08.333
I will explain to you
so that you know a little.

488
00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:11.670
When my father died. no one trusted me.

489
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:16.300
Do you know what I did?
I invited all the managers of the company

490
00:36:16.967 --> 00:36:22.347
to one of my slaughterhouses. I welcomed
them dressed in an apron full of blood.

491
00:36:23.265 --> 00:36:26.810
and I gutted a cow in front of everyone.

492
00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:28.020
Gutted?

493
00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:32.482
I grabbed the piece of meat
that was hanging from a hook...

494
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.361
I stuck in the knife...

495
00:36:37.988 --> 00:36:38.947
I split it in half...

496
00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:47.414
and I took out the entrails of the animal
and showed it to them.

497
00:36:47.497 --> 00:36:51.877
And I said.
"This is what you guys love to eat."

498
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.715
Some threw up and others became
vegetarians for the rest of their lives.

499
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:58.216
At least it did some good.

500
00:36:59.468 --> 00:37:01.178
Can I change the knives?

501
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:04.264
-Please.
-Please.

502
00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:11.021
Did you understand what I said?

503
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:14.983
It is very sharp.

504
00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:24.034
-Is everything fine?
-Wonderful.

505
00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:27.537
You have a weird accent.

506
00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:30.958
-Are you from the mountains? Córdoba?
-From Veracruz.

507
00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:33.669
-Veracruz?
-From Santa Fe de La Veracruz.

508
00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:34.753
...Veracruz.

509
00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.172
So. are you from Córdoba or Santa Fe?

510
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.591
-In the middle.
-Oh. borderline.

511
00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:41.510
-Near north.
-North?

512
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:42.970
-Near the river.
-What river?

513
00:37:43.053 --> 00:37:45.138
-Bravo.
-Caterina.

514
00:37:45.222 --> 00:37:48.058
-They call it "Bravo". it means fast.
-Very fast.

515
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.186
-Here you go. Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

516
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.689
Take that away right now. please.

517
00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:58.777
Let's take a photo.

518
00:37:59.528 --> 00:38:01.238
-Photo?
-She loves it.

519
00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:06.660
What the heck is Cointreau?

520
00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:14.001
-Why did you bring all them back?
-Customers didn't want them.

521
00:38:14.084 --> 00:38:15.419
They don't taste like Lu's drinks.

522
00:38:15.502 --> 00:38:17.087
Hey. look at this.

523
00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:23.468
Dinner with my mother-in-law.
a successful woman.

524
00:38:23.552 --> 00:38:24.678
Hashtag "my new family".

525
00:38:24.761 --> 00:38:26.430
Hashtag "we are so alike".

526
00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:34.396
Aren't you going to eat the chitterling?

527
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:37.524
She's on a diet.
so she can look good in the dress.

528
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.986
I should worry more about you
than about the dress. don't you think?

529
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:42.362
And your voice.

530
00:38:42.446 --> 00:38:45.782
True. I also have to take care of my voice
because I sing. you know?

531
00:38:45.866 --> 00:38:48.285
-Do you sing?
-No.

532
00:38:48.368 --> 00:38:52.122
-Do you sing tango?
-Of course I sing tango.

533
00:38:52.205 --> 00:38:55.667
Argentines love to sing tango
and eat beef.

534
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:57.711
What is your favorite tango song?

535
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.632
My favorite? There are many.

536
00:39:05.427 --> 00:39:06.344
"Volver"?

537
00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:07.888
-"Volver".
-"Volver"?

538
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:10.891
-What?
-Of course. that song is very well-known.

539
00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:13.602
I'd say it's a classic.

540
00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:15.771
What is the part you like the most?

541
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:16.980
All.

542
00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:20.317
But there must be a part
that you like most.

543
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.072
"Return.
I want to return to your arms again."

544
00:39:25.155 --> 00:39:27.324
You are joking with me.

545
00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:30.077
-This girl is kidding.
-Yes. it's a joke.

546
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.080
-It was a little joke.
-I didn't tell you. my mom.

547
00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:35.165
-she doesn't like jokes.
-She doesn't?

548
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:40.337
-Don't put the napkin on the table.
-Excuse me.

549
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.588
She knows it.

550
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:42.798
It doesn't look like it.

551
00:39:43.632 --> 00:39:45.092
I'm ready. "Volver".

552
00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:48.929
"Return with my forehead all wrinkled.

553
00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:52.265
My temples turned silver
by time's snowfall."

554
00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:54.726
-Turned silver?
-That part is beautiful.

555
00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:57.729
What are you looking at?

556
00:39:58.855 --> 00:40:01.066
What? I'm just looking down. because...

557
00:40:02.526 --> 00:40:06.655
Because for me this is very deep.
it touches my soul.

558
00:40:08.824 --> 00:40:12.119
And my soul is a volcano...

559
00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:16.873
where the winds of passion.
creation. and action come together.

560
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:25.549
That's why I love her. I love her.

561
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:27.175
Excuse me.

562
00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:29.594
Here is your steak.

563
00:40:29.678 --> 00:40:32.639
-Serve the steak to the lady.
-Of course.

564
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:37.018
-Mrs. Martina. what would you like?
-Give me some roasted steak.

565
00:40:37.102 --> 00:40:39.271
-Of course. What about you. sir?
-Thank you.

566
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:40.230
Gizzard.

567
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.357
It's hot.

568
00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:44.693
Enjoy it.

569
00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:50.365
So? You have to try the meat.

570
00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:55.704
I have already tried this cut of meat.
it is very good.

571
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:58.665
Try this one.

572
00:41:51.218 --> 00:41:53.261
How is it?

573
00:41:56.306 --> 00:41:57.265
Juicy.

574
00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:03.897
It's hot.

575
00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:16.326
She's nervous because of the wedding.

576
00:42:19.287 --> 00:42:20.789
I'm well...

577
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:22.999
well above my limit.

578
00:42:32.801 --> 00:42:34.386
We had a good time. right?

579
00:42:36.513 --> 00:42:38.640
Yes. too good.

580
00:42:39.683 --> 00:42:42.018
Mom. I will take you to your hotel.
We're close.

581
00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:47.315
No way. First we take the lady
because I have to talk to you alone.

582
00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:49.609
Tomorrow. We'll talk tomorrow.

583
00:42:49.693 --> 00:42:53.947
It's rude. we'll take the girl first.
Where do you live?

584
00:42:55.907 --> 00:42:59.202
-I...
-Mom. you make her nervous.

585
00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:02.622
La Bamba Street. number 805.

586
00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:04.165
-La Bamba?
-Pampa.

587
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:05.166
Pampa.

588
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.668
805 Pampa Street. We are close.

589
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:11.006
So let's go to 805 La Pampa.

590
00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:15.093
Gorgeous.

591
00:43:21.558 --> 00:43:23.518
Why are you moving so slowly?

592
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:24.853
As a precaution. Mom.

593
00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:29.816
That... That's my house.

594
00:43:30.442 --> 00:43:32.944
The one with the wooden door.

595
00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:33.945
Let's see.

596
00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:43.830
Where are we? Does anyone live here?

597
00:43:43.913 --> 00:43:45.749
Yes. but they're Mexican.

598
00:43:45.832 --> 00:43:48.251
For God's sake.

599
00:43:49.252 --> 00:43:52.756
They are buildings from the last century.
but they are very sturdy.

600
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:56.134
-Yes. They are sturdy.
-Very.

601
00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:59.095
Bye. Go. Go.

602
00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:00.805
-You guys have a lot to discuss.
-Yes.

603
00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:04.684
We are not going to leave.
we cannot leave you here alone.

604
00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:07.312
Open the door. go inside.
and then we'll leave.

605
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:17.989
Honey. don't tell me
you lost your keys again.

606
00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:21.159
Yes. I lost them.

607
00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:22.911
Let's go back to the restaurant.

608
00:44:22.994 --> 00:44:24.120
Yes. let's do that.

609
00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:25.830
-We probably left them here.
-Yes.

610
00:44:25.914 --> 00:44:27.207
Do you live with someone else?

611
00:44:27.749 --> 00:44:28.583
Yes. I do.

612
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:31.586
With my dad.

613
00:44:35.382 --> 00:44:36.216
Dad.

614
00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:38.676
Dad!

615
00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:43.264
Hey! Watch out.

616
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:44.599
It's me.

617
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:45.683
-Lu?
-Yes.

618
00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:49.979
Hug me. while I explain what's going on.
But not so strong.

619
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:53.733
Speak with an Argentine accent.
not like a Mexican.

620
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:55.860
Argentine.

621
00:44:58.905 --> 00:44:59.823
He's my dad.

622
00:45:01.783 --> 00:45:04.369
Antonio. Tona. Martina.

623
00:45:05.078 --> 00:45:05.912
Nice to meet you.

624
00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:07.038
Nice to meet you.

625
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.999
And he is Diego.

626
00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:12.961
Oh. my pleasure.

627
00:45:13.837 --> 00:45:17.841
The neighborhood is a bit rough.
so I like to be prepared.

628
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:21.636
You do the right thing
by being prepared.

629
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:23.304
Do you wanna come in?

630
00:45:23.388 --> 00:45:24.305
No.

631
00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:25.974
Yes. let's go.

632
00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:29.394
Martina. but you left your purse
in the car. didn't you?

633
00:45:29.477 --> 00:45:31.354
-Yes. Let's go.
-You're right.

634
00:45:31.438 --> 00:45:32.939
-And my phone.
-And your phone.

635
00:45:33.022 --> 00:45:34.107
I know where it is.

636
00:45:38.862 --> 00:45:40.947
I don't have time to explain
but I need your help.

637
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.866
-Okay.
-You are my dad. Okay?

638
00:45:43.616 --> 00:45:46.661
And Martina can't know
that we're Mexican.

639
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:48.705
Can you speak with an Argentine accent?

640
00:45:49.038 --> 00:45:52.584
Che. I'm fabulous.

641
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:54.752
I'm not just fabulous.

642
00:45:54.836 --> 00:45:57.338
I am spectacular.

643
00:45:58.298 --> 00:46:00.467
What. didn't you like it?

644
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:02.844
Incredible.

645
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.763
-We're getting married in three days.
-You and I?

646
00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:08.099
No. Diego and I.

647
00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:10.101
-Congratulations. Lu.
-No.

648
00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:12.770
I remember those days.

649
00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:16.649
carrying you in these arms.
And I told myself...

650
00:46:16.733 --> 00:46:18.234
my own blood...

651
00:46:18.902 --> 00:46:21.696
and now I only imagine
you dressed in white.

652
00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:25.533
arriving with me. walking down the aisle.

653
00:46:27.494 --> 00:46:28.328
What are you doing?

654
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:29.913
I'm getting into character.

655
00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:34.501
I'm not going to get married. not even
as a joke. We're lying to Martina.

656
00:46:34.584 --> 00:46:36.044
Why are you doing that?

657
00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:37.629
At this point. I don't know either.

658
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:46.054
No!

659
00:46:50.183 --> 00:46:52.185
No. No.

660
00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:55.939
You brought us to Mexico.
Martina hates Mexico.

661
00:47:00.693 --> 00:47:02.111
What is all this?

662
00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:05.073
Hey. hey. calm down.

663
00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:06.908
-We have to get rid of this.
-But why?

664
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:08.618
Hey!

665
00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:10.912
We have to get rid of this.

666
00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:13.206
Lu. you're freaking out.

667
00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:15.291
-Don't do that. Please.
-What?

668
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.584
-No. no. no!
-What?

669
00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:18.711
-What?
-These belong to my wife.

670
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:22.715
She died three years ago.

671
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.926
Tona. I'm sorry.

672
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:29.472
Okay. we should continue.

673
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.393
Yes. I would like that.

674
00:47:34.394 --> 00:47:36.854
We have to continue
with your boyfriend and his mom.

675
00:47:36.938 --> 00:47:37.772
Oh. yeah.

676
00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:40.108
Who. by the way. doesn't look bad at all.

677
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:41.442
Tona.

678
00:47:41.526 --> 00:47:44.529
Sorry. my love.
I just wanted to say that...

679
00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:48.908
she looks very healthy.
Don't think badly of me.

680
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:53.413
Okay.

681
00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:57.417
Here you are.

682
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.797
My apologies. my daughter is shy.
and I'm not well-dressed.

683
00:48:03.423 --> 00:48:06.968
And she didn't want her mother-in-law
to see me dressed in a bad way.

684
00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:10.388
I was listening to some tangos
while drinking vermouth.

685
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:12.307
And reading the newspaper

686
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.684
to see how my soccer team is doing.

687
00:48:14.767 --> 00:48:19.230
We're not gonna stay.
We just came to bring Lu. We're leaving.

688
00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:20.732
I'm here for a couple of days

689
00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:24.193
to find out absolutely everything
about my future daughter-in-law.

690
00:48:24.277 --> 00:48:26.279
We can meet at the wedding. right?

691
00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:28.448
No. I will not be here on that day.

692
00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:32.076
What a shame.

693
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.995
How about going to dinner tomorrow?

694
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:36.706
With a tango show.

695
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.668
Tango?

696
00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:44.213
No. Tomorrow. we have many things to do.

697
00:48:44.297 --> 00:48:49.260
Doesn't seem like a bad idea to me.
I don't usually go to those tourist traps.

698
00:48:49.344 --> 00:48:50.386
Promise?

699
00:48:51.763 --> 00:48:53.473
See you there. Martina.

700
00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:56.893
Let's go.

701
00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:00.938
We'll walk you out.

702
00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:04.901
Have a good night.

703
00:49:05.652 --> 00:49:07.612
Bye. my love.

704
00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:09.072
Bye. darling.

705
00:49:16.204 --> 00:49:17.622
Bye...

706
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.209
Thank you.

707
00:49:25.588 --> 00:49:27.340
-No way.
-Unbelievable.

708
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:31.636
-Do you have more of those patches?
-Up there.

709
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:45.983
Diego.

710
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.237
It looks delicious.

711
00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:51.239
It's warm.

712
00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:54.659
What is this? Vegan breakfast?

713
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:57.995
Continental. right?

714
00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.164
Right. Continental.

715
00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:05.253
So. you were going to Mexico. and then?

716
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.214
I was going to go to Mexico and...

717
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:10.925
the day before. I started feeling
that everything was weird.

718
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:13.845
Everything was different.

719
00:50:14.387 --> 00:50:17.640
I arrived in Mexico. I turned on
my phone and had a lot of missed calls.

720
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:21.519
I called her and the call...

721
00:50:22.395 --> 00:50:24.480
It was very brief.

722
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:28.651
She told me that she didn't want
to marry me.

723
00:50:29.861 --> 00:50:35.366
And from that moment on. she wouldn't
answer my calls or my messages.

724
00:50:38.327 --> 00:50:42.874
Lu. I'm just asking you to continue...

725
00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:45.918
pretending we're in a relationship
for two more days.

726
00:50:46.836 --> 00:50:47.670
Two days.

727
00:50:47.754 --> 00:50:50.757
I don't know.
I don't like this pretending.

728
00:50:52.592 --> 00:50:56.053
In addition to the clothes. in addition
to the first-class plane ticket...

729
00:50:58.097 --> 00:50:59.474
you can ask whatever you want.

730
00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:03.019
Whatever I want?

731
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.826
I can't believe this!

732
00:51:20.203 --> 00:51:21.579
He proposed to her.

733
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:26.417
No way. no way.

734
00:51:26.501 --> 00:51:27.460
No way.

735
00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:28.711
No way.

736
00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:32.673
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

737
00:51:32.757 --> 00:51:35.092
-Gorgeous.
-Gorgeous.

738
00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:37.303
The pronunciation is a little bit softer.

739
00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:38.221
Gorgeous.

740
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:42.892
-Are you gonna keep shopping?
-Of course!

741
00:51:42.975 --> 00:51:43.810
It already hurts.

742
00:51:43.893 --> 00:51:44.727
What hurts?

743
00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:46.062
My wallet.

744
00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:47.772
Your wallet?

745
00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:51.400
After so much shopping. I'm now starving.

746
00:51:51.484 --> 00:51:55.613
That's a little exaggerated.
It's lighter.

747
00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:56.531
Like this?

748
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:58.157
-The H shouldn't be as heavy.
-Okay.

749
00:51:58.241 --> 00:51:59.242
It's too strong.

750
00:51:59.325 --> 00:52:01.244
You can also use it with the T.

751
00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:02.703
-Taking.
-Taking.

752
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:04.664
-Take it.
-Take it.

753
00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:06.666
-John Lennon.
-John Lennon.

754
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:09.794
I have to take this weed
to John Lennon.

755
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:11.921
We call weed "Mari".

756
00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:15.132
No one would say that.
but it sounded better.

757
00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:16.050
-Yes?
-Yes.

758
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:17.051
-Better?
-Yes.

759
00:52:17.552 --> 00:52:20.721
Argentines seem to be deflating
when they speak.

760
00:52:21.347 --> 00:52:25.393
It's because they have to take a breath
to fill themselves with ego.

761
00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:27.728
The truth is that...

762
00:52:28.271 --> 00:52:29.981
People from here. from Buenos Aires.

763
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:33.484
when the French arrived.

764
00:52:33.568 --> 00:52:36.737
we changed our accent.
with words like champagne.

765
00:52:36.821 --> 00:52:38.823
champignon. et cetera.

766
00:52:38.906 --> 00:52:40.199
Diego. stop joking around.

767
00:52:40.283 --> 00:52:42.702
I'm not kidding. this is true.

768
00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:44.328
Lu...

769
00:52:46.706 --> 00:52:48.374
This boutique looks great.

770
00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:54.839
So I'm going to marry Lord Bull.

771
00:52:54.922 --> 00:52:56.674
Owner and lord of the cows.

772
00:52:58.301 --> 00:52:59.343
No?

773
00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:03.848
No. I don't own anything.
my mom owns everything.

774
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:07.435
If she decides not to leave me anything
and instead donates everything.

775
00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:09.729
I will not see a dime of her fortune.

776
00:53:10.438 --> 00:53:12.440
That's why she always wanted
to be independent.

777
00:53:13.649 --> 00:53:15.443
She don't give you credit.

778
00:53:16.402 --> 00:53:18.946
It's "doesn't". not "don't".

779
00:53:19.614 --> 00:53:22.742
But tell me. why do you say that?

780
00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:25.202
Did you buy this condo with your money?

781
00:53:25.995 --> 00:53:27.496
And the bookstore?

782
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:31.834
No. my mom helped me a little.

783
00:53:31.918 --> 00:53:34.503
But I'm going to give it back. All of it.

784
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.018
Do you like it?

785
00:53:50.186 --> 00:53:53.898
Yes. It fits you well. Do you like it?

786
00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:55.191
Yes.

787
00:53:59.070 --> 00:53:59.946
I'm going to change.

788
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:01.614
I'm going to change.

789
00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:14.502
The cows moo in the humid Pampas.

790
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.421
While they ruminate
on the freshly eaten grass.

791
00:54:18.089 --> 00:54:21.467
they ignore the thugs
who pass by in Malón.

792
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:23.469
who have kidnapped a girl.

793
00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:27.473
But a brave pawn confronts them...

794
00:54:27.974 --> 00:54:29.976
on behalf of Argentina.

795
00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.791
I guess the flickering

796
00:54:54.417 --> 00:54:56.877
Of the lights at distance

797
00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:59.547
They mark my return

798
00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:03.467
They are the same ones that lit up

799
00:55:03.551 --> 00:55:06.012
With its pale reflections

800
00:55:06.095 --> 00:55:08.556
Many hours of pain

801
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:11.017
I haven't danced the tango
for a long time.

802
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:16.939
Let's dance.

803
00:55:22.486 --> 00:55:25.406
When this is all over.
I'll take my mom home to sleep.

804
00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:28.159
And tomorrow morning.
after I drop her off at the airport

805
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:33.164
and make sure she's gone.
I will buy you a ticket to Mexico.

806
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:34.540
-Okay. perfect.
-Yes.

807
00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:36.876
-Is that okay?
-Yes. it's perfect.

808
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:53.225
What do you think about them?

809
00:55:55.227 --> 00:55:59.106
They look healthy. strong.

810
00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:03.444
I'm talking
about their relationship. Tona.

811
00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:08.699
They're deeply in love.

812
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.287
However. your daughter seems...

813
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.748
I don't know. she's a bit weird.

814
00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:18.375
Are you telling me
that you don't like my daughter?

815
00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:21.378
No. what I'm saying is that
I don't find her to be...

816
00:56:22.213 --> 00:56:23.547
very affectionate.

817
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.552
Well. maybe your son also has his issues.

818
00:56:29.595 --> 00:56:32.807
Do you think I like that my daughter
is marrying a spoiled man?

819
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:37.019
If you want us to be honest.
let's tell each other everything.

820
00:56:38.104 --> 00:56:40.439
And you already told Lucía all this?

821
00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:43.192
I don't have to like him.

822
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:45.736
She's the one marrying him.

823
00:56:46.695 --> 00:56:48.114
Look at them.

824
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:50.449
What could go wrong for them?

825
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:55.788
I hope you're right.
I'm sorry. Tona. but my shoes...

826
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:57.456
I can't stand them anymore.

827
00:56:58.624 --> 00:56:59.458
Yes.

828
00:57:05.297 --> 00:57:07.842
Hey. we have a problem.

829
00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:10.302
Your mom is suspicious
of your relationship

830
00:57:10.386 --> 00:57:11.929
because you don't seem affectionate.

831
00:57:12.388 --> 00:57:14.306
What are we supposed to do?

832
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:16.934
I don't know. I'm just telling you.

833
00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:20.020
And I'm leaving.
because my wife is by herself.

834
00:57:20.688 --> 00:57:22.148
-What?
-Sorry.

835
00:57:23.107 --> 00:57:25.109
-Your mother.
-Respect. Tona.

836
00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:26.193
-Yes. sorry.
-Okay.

837
00:57:26.277 --> 00:57:27.153
Yes.

838
00:57:27.236 --> 00:57:28.362
My mom is so young.

839
00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:30.865
-Let's act a little.
-Okay.

840
00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:31.782
Yes?

841
00:57:33.576 --> 00:57:36.287
Yes. but a little more noticeable.

842
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:38.706
What are you talking about?

843
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:40.708
-Like there's laughter and affection.
-Got it.

844
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:45.462
-It was too much.
-I noticed it.

845
00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:49.133
So get a little closer.

846
00:57:49.884 --> 00:57:50.885
Wait for me.

847
00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:52.553
Grab the phone.

848
00:57:52.636 --> 00:57:54.430
This is so cute. let's make a video.

849
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:56.348
What are you doing?

850
00:57:56.432 --> 00:57:57.266
Ready?

851
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.104
No way.

852
00:58:05.357 --> 00:58:06.567
Come on.

853
00:58:08.027 --> 00:58:09.111
Let's go.

854
00:58:09.195 --> 00:58:10.446
I'm coming. damn it.

855
00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:11.780
Bye.

856
00:58:11.864 --> 00:58:12.698
What are you doing?

857
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.034
-Why did you do that?
-Let's save it.

858
00:58:15.117 --> 00:58:17.661
We have to show my mom
that we love each other.

859
00:58:17.745 --> 00:58:18.579
Okay.

860
00:58:19.622 --> 00:58:20.456
Do something.

861
00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:22.208
You have very beautiful skin. you know?

862
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:23.125
Really?

863
00:58:23.209 --> 00:58:24.835
Yes. but it looks horrible over here.

864
00:58:25.753 --> 00:58:27.504
I think age affected you quite a bit.

865
00:58:28.714 --> 00:58:30.507
-What's up with your hands?
-Nothing.

866
00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:34.011
They feel like sandpaper.
I thought you were exfoliating me.

867
00:58:34.136 --> 00:58:36.680
It is because they are the hands
of someone

868
00:58:36.764 --> 00:58:39.850
who has actually worked in their life.
Not everyone is a princess.

869
00:58:39.934 --> 00:58:41.769
-You are not a princess.
-Nope.

870
00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:42.686
Hence the mustache.

871
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.688
-I don't have a mustache.
-No?

872
00:58:48.067 --> 00:58:48.901
You see?

873
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:51.779
I told you everything is fine.

874
00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:53.864
Yes. apparently you were right.

875
00:58:53.948 --> 00:58:55.616
We must leave them alone.

876
00:58:56.408 --> 00:58:58.535
If they're not under pressure.
things go better.

877
00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:00.454
Not always.

878
00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:09.713
When you feel like something feels heavy
inside of you...

879
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.133
let it go.

880
00:59:14.093 --> 00:59:15.010
Let it go.

881
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.766
Thanks. Tona.

882
00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:23.894
-Let's dance.
-I don't know how.

883
00:59:23.978 --> 00:59:25.062
Is my mom looking?

884
00:59:27.356 --> 00:59:28.774
Should we leave through the back?

885
00:59:28.857 --> 00:59:30.651
Through the back?

886
00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:31.860
That's it.

887
00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:34.071
I don't know how to dance.

888
00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:35.281
Just like this.

889
00:59:35.364 --> 00:59:38.325
-Easy. To the right.
-It will be embarrassing.

890
00:59:38.409 --> 00:59:40.703
No. Your leg to the front.

891
00:59:41.287 --> 00:59:43.163
-There.
-There you go.

892
00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:46.667
Now. sideways.

893
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.002
Come back.

894
00:59:48.085 --> 00:59:49.253
Sideways again.

895
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:51.964
And your leg.

896
00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:54.883
That was cheating.
I don't want to play anymore.

897
00:59:54.967 --> 00:59:56.552
-Actually no.
-Lu.

898
00:59:56.635 --> 00:59:57.511
Easy.

899
00:59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.889
Trust me. close your eyes.

900
01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.727
Seriously. Diego. if you make me...

901
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.854
-Let me lead you.
-...fall over.

902
01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.939
Nothing is going to happen.

903
01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.650
We walk to the side slowly.

904
01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:15.195
Turn. That's right.

905
01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:59.615
Thank you for sharing
this magical night with us.

906
01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:02.451
What's happening?

907
01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:03.660
She is no longer watching.

908
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.456
So you are an actor?

909
01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.293
Yes. film. television. theater.

910
01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:12.586
And do you work here?

911
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.796
Yes. exactly.

912
01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:15.631
You put on a show.

913
01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:16.548
That's it.

914
01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:18.133
Nice. Tona.

915
01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.929
They got applause and everything.

916
01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.430
Yes. I'm a little embarrassed.

917
01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:27.101
We have to go to sleep. Mom. We have to be
at the airport early tomorrow.

918
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.770
Do you have to go now?

919
01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:33.690
I really don't have anything urgent to do.

920
01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.360
You're not going to be at the wedding.

921
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.570
At least stay one more day.

922
01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:41.115
Do it for them and for you.

923
01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:46.370
The truth is that.
after what you just told me.

924
01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:51.083
my ex-husband and the Aztec mummy
are not going to get

925
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.293
anything else from me.
for the rest of my life.

926
01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:55.546
Can we watch the game?

927
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.340
Around the corner from Diego's bookstore.
there is a bar.

928
01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:00.968
How does it sound?

929
01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:03.971
-Great?
-Great?

930
01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:11.562
"Do it for them and for you."
Are you serious?

931
01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:14.815
Martina is not as bad as you think.

932
01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:19.319
She better tell you how she gutted
a baby cow to impress some men.

933
01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.612
Also...

934
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.699
I think there's something going on
between the two.

935
01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:24.867
Between Diego and me?

936
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.618
Between Martina and me.

937
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.872
I saw it clearly in her eyes
when I told her...

938
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:34.835
"When you feel something heavy
building up inside of you...

939
01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:38.797
drop it and let it go."

940
01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:43.760
Tona. did you flirt with her using
a catchphrase from a laxative commercial?

941
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.430
That's pretty low. isn't it?

942
01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:47.723
Can you imagine...

943
01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.017
a double wedding?

944
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.854
There will be no double or single wedding.
There will be no wedding at all.

945
01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.564
It is a real shame.

946
01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.487
How long have you owned this bookstore?

947
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:06.492
Two years. Almost three. actually.

948
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.453
What about you with the bar?

949
01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:12.122
Two-- No. six months.

950
01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:16.460
Six months. But before.
I was an employee there.

951
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.131
That's how I met my partners.
They went there every weekend.

952
01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:27.679
Then I heard the owner was going to sell
the bar. so I convinced them to buy it.

953
01:03:29.348 --> 01:03:31.433
They come from a family with money.

954
01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:33.310
Like you.

955
01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:39.691
How great. But are you also a partner?
Did you also invest money?

956
01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.151
Yes. of course.

957
01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:46.698
My dad has a trust that...
It's complicated.

958
01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.243
-But he...
-Lu...

959
01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:51.995
Even you don't believe that.

960
01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:53.997
Neither do you.

961
01:03:56.959 --> 01:03:59.169
The truth is. I don't have a dad.

962
01:04:00.629 --> 01:04:02.172
He left when I was little.

963
01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:04.508
and the only thing he left
was a book by Sabines.

964
01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:08.637
That's why I knew the poem
that I thought you wrote for me.

965
01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:12.516
I've given up on my partners.
but I think that after this trip...

966
01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:14.768
I will have the money.

967
01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:18.355
Why after this trip?
What are you going to do?

968
01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:25.112
Why does your mom hate Mexicans?
And who is the Aztec mummy?

969
01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:31.118
My parents traveled to Acapulco
to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

970
01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:36.331
And on that trip. they met
a very beautiful and elegant woman.

971
01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.960
She offered them a yacht for purchase.

972
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.172
They bought it
and put it in my dad's name.

973
01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:49.678
In the end. it turned out that
this woman was my dad's lover.

974
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.555
-No.
-Yes. and there they are.

975
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.724
sailing around the world. happily.

976
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.936
Some time later.
my mother received the divorce papers.

977
01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:02.149
And they were sent with a tequila sunrise.

978
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.066
No.

979
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.776
Yes. just as you hear it.

980
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.281
If you knew my mom a little more.
you would understand why this is so.

981
01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:12.951
It was difficult for her.
she had to raise me on her own.

982
01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:17.080
I think she was a bit overprotective.

983
01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:18.290
A little.

984
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:19.750
What did you say?

985
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.586
I said "a little". not much.

986
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.296
I am working on it.

987
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.425
What were you doing in Mexico?

988
01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:33.722
I went to visit some investors who wanted
to open a bookstore like this one.

989
01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:34.890
And what happened?

990
01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.933
My fiancee broke up with me via text.

991
01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.645
And the truth is that I wasn't
in a good mood for business.

992
01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:40.562
I see.

993
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.587
FINAL ARGENTINA VS MEXICO
TODAY 7:00 PM

994
01:06:09.091 --> 01:06:11.343
To the side.

995
01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:15.347
Mexico may obtain something.

996
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.431
Damn!

997
01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:18.558
What happened?

998
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:20.644
I miss Lu.

999
01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:22.229
I miss her too.

1000
01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.815
Now. the Argentinian team...

1001
01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:28.443
What if we put on a song by Luis Miguel
after the game. like she used to?

1002
01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.570
No. that would make it worse.

1003
01:06:31.363 --> 01:06:34.491
Who will dominate the ball?
Down!

1004
01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.744
No! That's a foul!
It's a foul!

1005
01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:41.331
This son of a bitch referee!

1006
01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:42.916
Oh. God. I'm going to break this.

1007
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.501
-No. no!
-Stop!

1008
01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.211
This is not possible!

1009
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.588
-Stop. stop!
-Easy.

1010
01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.842
Fucking ass!

1011
01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.176
Is your mom always like this?

1012
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.261
No. she gets worse.

1013
01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.971
For eight years he has missed goals.

1014
01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:57.264
This is passion.

1015
01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:59.015
Motherfucker!

1016
01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.767
-Fire.
-Oh. please.

1017
01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.602
-It's a storm.
-Through there. Yes!

1018
01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:06.022
Shit.

1019
01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:17.617
Diego.

1020
01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.620
Oh. no. too many cooks spoil the soup.

1021
01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:24.291
It's been so long. How have you been?

1022
01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.709
-Good. good.
-Yes?

1023
01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:29.629
Yes. let me introduce you to Lu.
She is my fiancee.

1024
01:07:30.756 --> 01:07:31.798
Your fiancee? Where?

1025
01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:34.468
Here. Behind the gem.

1026
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.553
How cute.

1027
01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:40.348
We've known each other for so long
and you always preferred a good physique.

1028
01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:42.726
I see you changed your preferences.
Quite a lot.

1029
01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:45.771
After a certain age. I began
to care more about brains.

1030
01:07:45.854 --> 01:07:47.522
I have a master's in astrophysics.

1031
01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:48.940
And feelings.

1032
01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:53.278
I have a foundation
to help orphaned children.

1033
01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:54.780
-I'm kind of...
-Pure crap.

1034
01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:57.574
Martina. Is the game so bad?

1035
01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.243
I wasn't exactly referring to the game.

1036
01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:01.995
I imagined.

1037
01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:04.164
Your mom never changes. does she?

1038
01:08:05.207 --> 01:08:08.919
She is the worst. A total snake.

1039
01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.880
You are the only one who has to shine. Go.

1040
01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:15.383
Okay! How cute is this meeting. right?

1041
01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:18.470
But I think it's time to go back
to the table. with your mom.

1042
01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.388
-Yeah. come on.
-Can we go with them?

1043
01:08:20.472 --> 01:08:22.057
I came with some friends.

1044
01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.477
Only if you don't mind
the fact that I was Diego's first love.

1045
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.104
No. you were not my first love.

1046
01:08:28.188 --> 01:08:30.148
You learned everything from me. Diego.

1047
01:08:30.232 --> 01:08:31.608
-I don't have any problem.
-Nope?

1048
01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:34.569
-He already told me about you.
-Yes?

1049
01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:36.530
-And all those who came after.
-Yes.

1050
01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:37.447
Those too.

1051
01:08:38.365 --> 01:08:40.534
Honey. she needs to see
the photos of the proposal.

1052
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.161
-Come on. show her the photos. love.
-No.

1053
01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.996
Thanks. what a nice moment.

1054
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.791
We have to tell him
about our honeymoon plans.

1055
01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:52.921
You know what?
I'll just sit at another table.

1056
01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:54.756
-this way it's easier with the check.
-No!

1057
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.842
Thanks. See you.

1058
01:08:56.925 --> 01:08:59.219
Congratulations on your marriage. Diego.

1059
01:08:59.302 --> 01:09:01.263
Thank you. thank you.
it was nice to see you.

1060
01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:06.142
You were incredible!

1061
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.106
Hey!

1062
01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.819
No. it's very cold here.

1063
01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:26.246
Look over there. there's the match.

1064
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.791
Argentina! Argentina!

1065
01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.126
Hey. hey. hey!

1066
01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:35.714
Argentina! Argentina!
Hey. hey. hey!

1067
01:09:35.797 --> 01:09:37.132
-Hey. hey. hey!
-Let's go!

1068
01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.969
Please don't let yourself
be overshadowed by that woman.

1069
01:09:41.052 --> 01:09:45.015
We'll be back
We'll be back

1070
01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:48.685
We will come back again

1071
01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:52.188
We will be champions again

1072
01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:55.317
Just like in '86

1073
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.195
We'll be back. we'll be back...

1074
01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:01.698
-Stop the singing.
-Why?

1075
01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:05.076
-Don't play along.
-We're singing. Mom.

1076
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.161
Stop.

1077
01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:09.122
Just like in '86...

1078
01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:12.042
Lucía. you are the one
who has to lead. Let's go.

1079
01:10:14.336 --> 01:10:16.421
-Let's go.
-Just like her.

1080
01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.006
The stadium chanting.

1081
01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:21.468
They sing it during the games.

1082
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.136
I don't know how to sing it.

1083
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.055
-So?
-I can't sing.

1084
01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.514
I have to take care of my voice.

1085
01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:28.183
You have to sing. come on.

1086
01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.101
Mom. don't bother Lucía anymore.

1087
01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:32.103
You bother me. Enough.

1088
01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:37.943
Ladies. gentlemen.
She is getting married tomorrow.

1089
01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:43.573
That's why she has to sing. Sing.

1090
01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:50.413
We'll be back. we'll be back...

1091
01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:58.129
Why aren't they singing? She just sang it.
Don't they know it?

1092
01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:02.842
We just sang this one. so you have
to pick another one. Do you know others?

1093
01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.135
Yes.

1094
01:11:04.219 --> 01:11:06.262
-Don't make me look bad. Lucía.
-Of course.

1095
01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:08.556
-You are going to help me.
-Me?

1096
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.308
-Yes. Yes.
-Come on.

1097
01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:11.935
The one that... Dad.

1098
01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.687
You taught it to me. actually.

1099
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.939
If you push her. she gets uncomfortable.

1100
01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:16.898
Smooth!

1101
01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.149
Look. she's singing.

1102
01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:22.320
My heart is on the court

1103
01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:25.156
-Smooth!
-Smooth!

1104
01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:29.577
We will always... win

1105
01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:31.413
-Smooth!
-Smooth!

1106
01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:32.414
It's a popular song.

1107
01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.457
Blue-- White. and sky blue

1108
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.418
As I always dreamed

1109
01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.920
-As I always dreamed of you
-Smooth!

1110
01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:41.923
My heart is on the court

1111
01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:43.508
-Smooth!
-Smooth!

1112
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.176
White and sky blue

1113
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:48.096
As I always dreamed of

1114
01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.806
-As I always dreamed of you
-Smooth!

1115
01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:53.101
My heart is on the court

1116
01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:54.352
Smooth!

1117
01:11:54.436 --> 01:11:57.480
We will always win

1118
01:11:57.564 --> 01:11:58.940
Smooth!

1119
01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:02.902
White and sky blue
As I always dreamed of

1120
01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.989
As I always dreamed of you

1121
01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:19.252
No. no. no. Let's see.
That was very weird.

1122
01:12:20.128 --> 01:12:21.171
What happened. baby?

1123
01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:24.174
This is a Mexican song.
As if she was...

1124
01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:27.886
Mexican.

1125
01:12:33.892 --> 01:12:38.104
Come here. you.
Come here! What did you say?

1126
01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:40.315
That this girl is not Argentine.
she is Mexican.

1127
01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:43.693
Mexican? Little bitch!

1128
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:33.701
Free shots for everyone!

1129
01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:41.918
Wait. wait.

1130
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.963
Who is going to pay for all this?

1131
01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:47.173
Me. her mother-in-law.

1132
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.304
Thank you.

1133
01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:12.740
I could not avoid it.

1134
01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:14.159
I shouldn't show you the video.

1135
01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:15.118
Did she post it?

1136
01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.411
It's a viral video.

1137
01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.371
-Viral?
-Viral.

1138
01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:21.166
As I always dreamed of you!

1139
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.258
I want you to try the dessert I made.

1140
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:33.178
Don't fuck with me. you don't know how
to prepare desserts. please.

1141
01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:34.470
Never in his life.

1142
01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:38.057
Well. I ordered it.
but I'm going to serve it.

1143
01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:41.186
You can never lie to your mother.

1144
01:14:41.269 --> 01:14:43.229
The girls took care of the drinks.

1145
01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:46.482
No worries.

1146
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.485
Hey. what's for dessert?

1147
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:57.493
Lu... What do you like about Diego?

1148
01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:02.665
I already realized
what Diego likes about you.

1149
01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:04.083
But what do you like about him?

1150
01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:07.587
Speaking of Diego.

1151
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:11.174
I like that he is brave. I like that.

1152
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.091
Brave?

1153
01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:15.470
Yes. he tries to do many things.

1154
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.431
And he almost always fails.

1155
01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:24.395
But he takes risks. he is brave like you.

1156
01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:26.814
My dear girl.

1157
01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:30.318
You are also brave.

1158
01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:34.155
Okay!

1159
01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.408
Tona. darling. bring me a drink.

1160
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:41.371
"Dear". huh?

1161
01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:44.290
In a moment. darling. Anyone else?

1162
01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:45.667
I'm fine. thanks.

1163
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.295
I'm fine too. dear. thank you.

1164
01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:51.339
Sometimes he is a fool.

1165
01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.258
A little jealous too.

1166
01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:54.175
A little.

1167
01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.135
With me too.

1168
01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.138
-Right. my love?
-Sorry. I didn't hear it.

1169
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:02.225
I've never seen him like this. ever.

1170
01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:03.309
Neither have I.

1171
01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:06.813
It's so cute.

1172
01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.147
Yes.

1173
01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:13.861
Dessert is coming.

1174
01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:14.779
Cheers.

1175
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:19.784
Something happened?

1176
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:23.997
Martina.

1177
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.331
This drink is very strong.

1178
01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:26.374
Are you okay?

1179
01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:28.126
I'm fine.
but what kind of liquor is it?

1180
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.336
We should cut down on alcohol a bit.

1181
01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.880
No. don't fuck with me. please.

1182
01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:35.258
It's my last night with you.
What kind of liquor is it?

1183
01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.342
EMBOSCADA
AGED TEQUILA

1184
01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.136
It's... It's...

1185
01:16:39.387 --> 01:16:41.180
-No. no.
-You don't remember?

1186
01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:42.932
No.

1187
01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:53.860
It looks like the girl
is the drunkest of all.

1188
01:16:54.736 --> 01:16:55.903
What happened?

1189
01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:57.739
Something happened.

1190
01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:00.074
I dropped the bottle.
But the cat is fine.

1191
01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:01.200
What happened?

1192
01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.119
I'll tell you what's going on.

1193
01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:05.705
I don't think you need to know
the whole truth.

1194
01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:09.083
The bottle that Lu just threw...

1195
01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:10.752
-What was it?
-Was it whiskey?

1196
01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:11.794
No. it was tequila.

1197
01:17:11.878 --> 01:17:12.879
Tequila?

1198
01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.547
Yes. what happened is that Dad

1199
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.466
-came with his wife--
-Yes. the Aztec mummy.

1200
01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:19.260
He came.
he brought a royal tequila

1201
01:17:19.344 --> 01:17:22.388
and Tona served it to you
without realizing it.

1202
01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.933
Did he want to ruin
my last night with you?

1203
01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.769
That was it.

1204
01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:30.563
It seems very unfair to me.

1205
01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.816
Because they're coming to your wedding
and I am not.

1206
01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:38.363
But I know something. Tona told me.

1207
01:17:39.072 --> 01:17:43.409
"When you feel something heavy
building up inside of you. let it go.

1208
01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:44.994
Let it go."

1209
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.831
Unclog-it Plus.

1210
01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:49.749
What?

1211
01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.418
It's good for you. Martina.

1212
01:17:52.502 --> 01:17:56.631
Wait. I don't understand
what's being said.

1213
01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.092
That I will stay for your wedding.

1214
01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.344
-What?
-No.

1215
01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:04.305
Wait. Dad confirmed that he's coming
with the woman.

1216
01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:07.225
I don't give a fuck about the Aztec mummy.

1217
01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.519
She won't rip my heart out again.

1218
01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:12.063
Because this time around.
l know how to defend myself.

1219
01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.733
But I won't miss your wedding.

1220
01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:18.403
And much less with this incredible woman.

1221
01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:20.530
Just so you know.

1222
01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:21.447
Cheers!

1223
01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.117
Cheers.

1224
01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.119
Cheers.

1225
01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:12.373
Will she be all right?

1226
01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:16.252
It's weird that she hasn't left the room
and won't make a sound.

1227
01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:17.795
Let's hope she doesn't remember.

1228
01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:21.841
Come on. come on.
there are many things to do.

1229
01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:25.344
But why do they have these faces?

1230
01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:28.055
It looks like a funeral. not a wedding.

1231
01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:31.434
Let's go out. I have to buy my dress.

1232
01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.144
-Dress.
-Of course.

1233
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:36.314
Do you want to come with me?

1234
01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:39.484
No... No. I'd love to.

1235
01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:41.319
But I have a lot of things to do.

1236
01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.070
Yes. Mom. the wedding day is a problem.

1237
01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:44.614
We have a lot to organize.

1238
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.115
I'd be delighted to come with.

1239
01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:48.701
You're so old.

1240
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.077
Just like wine.

1241
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:54.499
Dad. remember.
you promised to come with me.

1242
01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.044
To...To that.

1243
01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.170
It's...

1244
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:03.841
Forgive me. Martina.
but I have to go with you.

1245
01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:08.804
Excuse me. You have everything
organized for the wedding.

1246
01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:11.682
but I'm missing my dress.

1247
01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:16.062
And I want to remind you that
there are only ten hours left.

1248
01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:17.480
Bye.

1249
01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:18.898
-Bye. Mom.
-Cheers.

1250
01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.191
Be careful going down.

1251
01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:21.108
Yes.

1252
01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.538
How many shampoos
do you have up there?

1253
01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:35.915
I've got...

1254
01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.500
-Like 16.
-I didn't count them.

1255
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.335
It could be. Was it enough?

1256
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.670
Yes. I used all 16.

1257
01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:48.594
Diego. we can't get married.
It would be crazy.

1258
01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:52.265
And what do we do? Do we run away?

1259
01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:56.894
Do you want to do the same thing your
asshole daddy did? To me? To your mom?

1260
01:20:57.395 --> 01:20:59.689
We have to tell them the truth. Now.

1261
01:21:00.398 --> 01:21:01.399
I can't. I'm...

1262
01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:03.943
I'm a failure.

1263
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:08.364
Diego. you are not a failure. Hey.

1264
01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.075
You're just single.

1265
01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:17.999
It's just that I've never. in all my life.
seen my mom so happy.

1266
01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.710
Never. and I'm a coward.

1267
01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:25.339
Because I could have stopped this sooner
without involving you.

1268
01:21:27.133 --> 01:21:28.843
I swear. I don't want to hurt anyone.

1269
01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:34.140
Well. we all make mistakes and tell lies.

1270
01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:37.852
Assuming we get married.
what happens then?

1271
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.272
My mom goes home...

1272
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.191
and you go back to Mexico.

1273
01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:46.319
And then what happens?

1274
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.531
You're going to tell her a different lie
every time she asks why I'm not here.

1275
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.411
We get married. and months later.
I'll tell her it didn't work out.

1276
01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.997
I'll be like everything else
in your life.

1277
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:03.919
Like the photo gallery. like the museum.
like the food truck.

1278
01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:06.172
We have to get married.

1279
01:22:11.177 --> 01:22:12.720
What if you say no at the altar?

1280
01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:15.056
No. no. listen.

1281
01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:20.311
It would be like your mom said.

1282
01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:22.146
that we want to give ourselves more time.

1283
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.106
that we want
to get to know each other more.

1284
01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.734
Diego. you have to say no at the altar.

1285
01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.403
Say something.

1286
01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:33.908
It makes a lot of sense.

1287
01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.660
Okay. I'll say no...

1288
01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:38.579
I'll say no.

1289
01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.918
I can only think about what I really want.

1290
01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:46.379
What do you want?

1291
01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:56.949
LOVE

1292
01:23:58.993 --> 01:24:01.871
You look nice. Tona.
Handsome.

1293
01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:05.416
Your wife is beautiful.

1294
01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.295
I'm going to take care of everything.

1295
01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.380
Let me worry about it. You relax.

1296
01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:13.048
I'm ready.

1297
01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:37.823
The groom must not see the bride
in her dress before the wedding.

1298
01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:40.159
Tona. it's a fake wedding

1299
01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:42.995
It really is a fake wedding.

1300
01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:44.705
Of course.

1301
01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.291
How do I look?

1302
01:24:48.626 --> 01:24:49.668
Gorgeous.

1303
01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:52.087
You're not supposed to see her. idiot.

1304
01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:54.548
Beautiful.

1305
01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.093
My wife's wedding gown.

1306
01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:02.640
You look divine.

1307
01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:07.061
My wife and I never asked for children.

1308
01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:10.981
But we would have loved
to have someone like you.

1309
01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:15.319
No. No tears.

1310
01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:17.655
I need you to be calm.

1311
01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:20.282
Meanwhile. I'll fix everything else.

1312
01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.494
Are you sure you can organize a wedding?

1313
01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:25.120
It was unavoidable.

1314
01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:28.290
Sooner or later this had to happen.

1315
01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:29.834
What?

1316
01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:33.462
Going from actor to producer.

1317
01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:37.883
We are going to produce a wedding.

1318
01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:39.260
The budget.

1319
01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:40.553
We need a budget.

1320
01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:44.431
We need cash. credit cards. everything.

1321
01:25:44.515 --> 01:25:46.058
Money. funds.

1322
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.434
bills. dough.

1323
01:25:47.518 --> 01:25:48.519
Benjamins.

1324
01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.356
Excuse me. I'm going to get ready.

1325
01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:53.440
Thank you.

1326
01:25:59.071 --> 01:25:59.989
Do you think...

1327
01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:03.200
it's prudent that Tona
takes care of all that?

1328
01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:07.037
You're forbidden from seeing me.

1329
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:14.336
I'll see you at the church then.

1330
01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:17.756
See you there.

1331
01:26:30.144 --> 01:26:31.270
UNION OF ACTORS AND EXTRAS

1332
01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:32.688
Can't believe it's stuck again.

1333
01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:36.567
Graciela. where did you take the computer
to get fixed? It's stuck again.

1334
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:37.735
Shitty computer.

1335
01:26:37.818 --> 01:26:39.320
LUCRECIA COPPOLA
SECRETARY

1336
01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.655
The director's niece.

1337
01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:44.658
I hear you.

1338
01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:47.870
I need 30 extras

1339
01:26:48.579 --> 01:26:50.539
to pretend to be invitees at a wedding.

1340
01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:52.458
When are you shooting?

1341
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:55.628
We won't really be recording.

1342
01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:56.754
Is it a play?

1343
01:26:56.837 --> 01:26:59.340
Not that either.
I don't know how to explain.

1344
01:26:59.423 --> 01:27:03.344
If you don't know. I don't know either.
Is it a performance?

1345
01:27:03.928 --> 01:27:04.762
Yes.

1346
01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:09.934
I would need 15 men and 15 women.
more or less.

1347
01:27:10.017 --> 01:27:11.185
When?

1348
01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:12.311
For today.

1349
01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:13.395
Oh. for today.

1350
01:27:13.479 --> 01:27:16.732
Graciela. track down 15 men
and 15 women for today.

1351
01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:21.070
And tea for today too. Anything else?

1352
01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:26.158
Yes. I need half the people
to be like me.

1353
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.117
Seniors?

1354
01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:30.079
Just like me.

1355
01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:31.288
Oh. an LI.

1356
01:27:31.372 --> 01:27:33.415
-LI?
-Latin International.

1357
01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:34.667
That's it.

1358
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.211
LI. 15. due today!

1359
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.588
I'll tell you what.
if they have to talk...

1360
01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:42.132
they charge extra.

1361
01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:43.133
No talking then.

1362
01:27:43.217 --> 01:27:44.385
No talking.

1363
01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:47.554
I have to hurry. because I'm picking up
a surprise for my daughter.

1364
01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:50.224
-Ready. we stay like this.
-Greetings to your uncle.

1365
01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:51.767
We don't talk.

1366
01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:53.769
-No?
-No.

1367
01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:56.021
It's noticeable.
Yes. See you later.

1368
01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:58.816
Graciela. the tea!

1369
01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:11.870
Lu. I have a surprise for you.

1370
01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:12.788
What?

1371
01:28:18.836 --> 01:28:21.839
What are you doing here?
What do you think?

1372
01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:23.716
Did you want to see if all this was true?

1373
01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:25.634
How could you do this to us?

1374
01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:26.719
Do what?

1375
01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.846
Get married without us.

1376
01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.139
Oh. that.

1377
01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.391
Everything happened so fast.

1378
01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.643
And I didn't think
my partners could come here.

1379
01:28:34.727 --> 01:28:36.562
Lupe. we are not your partners.

1380
01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:38.022
We are your best friends.

1381
01:28:38.105 --> 01:28:40.566
No. we are your sisters.

1382
01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:43.027
We have always admired you.

1383
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:44.737
You are brave. daring.

1384
01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:48.157
If Tona hadn't told us. we wouldn't
have found out about your wedding.

1385
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.950
You look beautiful.

1386
01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:53.662
But it's going to be
a super small thing. tiny.

1387
01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:56.123
Then we'll see if we do something else.

1388
01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:59.460
Well. it won't be so tiny.
I don't think so.

1389
01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:02.629
We agreed it would be small.

1390
01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.968
You know how Tona Productions works.

1391
01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:18.979
Son. you look amazing.

1392
01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:20.147
I told you. right?

1393
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:22.066
Three times just today.

1394
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:24.568
I'd have to go back in time
for all of them.

1395
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:26.612
Don't be bad.

1396
01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:30.949
Can you believe I don't see
your father anywhere?

1397
01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:35.954
I called him and asked him not to come.
I don't want any drama.

1398
01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:38.665
Can I tell you something?
I could care less about him.

1399
01:29:38.749 --> 01:29:40.292
Good for you.

1400
01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:44.171
-Who are all these people?
-Friends. Mom.

1401
01:29:44.254 --> 01:29:46.256
But I don't know anyone.

1402
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:48.050
They're Lu's friends.

1403
01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:50.886
-But if...
-Look. Charly! You know Charly!

1404
01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.679
Charly.

1405
01:29:52.763 --> 01:29:55.808
I met Charly at a booksellers
convention in Lima.

1406
01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:57.684
What a good trip.

1407
01:29:57.768 --> 01:30:00.521
-Yes.
-Wait. Charly.

1408
01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:03.565
What do you think of Lu?

1409
01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:08.320
Tona! There's Tona.

1410
01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:09.446
There's Tona.

1411
01:30:09.947 --> 01:30:11.240
Tona!

1412
01:30:12.658 --> 01:30:14.284
Are you nervous?

1413
01:30:14.368 --> 01:30:16.120
And Lu. where is she?

1414
01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:19.790
Waiting for you to come in
to meet her at the altar.

1415
01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:23.210
I have to talk to her.
Excuse me. gentlemen.

1416
01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:24.920
Excuse me.

1417
01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:30.425
I'm sorry for not believing you.

1418
01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:34.346
There's your mother-in-law.

1419
01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.933
See you inside. partner.

1420
01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.229
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1421
01:30:43.564 --> 01:30:44.398
Thanks.

1422
01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:53.115
Sit down.

1423
01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:00.622
Look...

1424
01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:04.001
I just wanted to tell you that...

1425
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.963
you are the best thing
that could've happened to our family.

1426
01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:11.842
And now I can rest easy...

1427
01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:15.554
because Diego found his soulmate.

1428
01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:22.227
Thank you for being so authentic.

1429
01:31:24.563 --> 01:31:27.608
You are the most authentic woman
I have ever met.

1430
01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:33.030
Thanks.

1431
01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:35.490
I love you. my girl.

1432
01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:37.826
Me too.

1433
01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:52.424
These are all extras?

1434
01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:53.967
Almost every one of them.

1435
01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:55.385
What do you mean?

1436
01:31:55.469 --> 01:31:58.305
It is not easy
to convince a real priest

1437
01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:01.058
to let us use a real church...

1438
01:32:01.767 --> 01:32:04.561
to host a fake wedding
with a fake priest.

1439
01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:06.855
And how did you convince him?

1440
01:32:06.939 --> 01:32:09.942
I didn't convince him.
The priest is a real one.

1441
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.258
This decision they have made...

1442
01:32:34.841 --> 01:32:36.218
is transcendental.

1443
01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:39.179
It requires maturity...

1444
01:32:40.264 --> 01:32:42.599
and responsibility.

1445
01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:47.562
It requires sincere and mutual love.

1446
01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:48.563
And love for God.

1447
01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:50.816
Do you understand?

1448
01:32:52.276 --> 01:32:54.194
-Yes. Father.
-Yes.

1449
01:32:54.987 --> 01:32:56.238
Well. Diego...

1450
01:32:57.614 --> 01:33:00.117
do you take Lucía.

1451
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:03.412
to be your lawfully wedded wife.

1452
01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:05.914
to love and respect her...

1453
01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:09.042
til death do you part?

1454
01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:21.930
Yes.

1455
01:33:23.056 --> 01:33:24.266
I do.

1456
01:33:25.559 --> 01:33:26.476
I can't say it.

1457
01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:31.940
Jackass.

1458
01:33:33.442 --> 01:33:34.276
Lucía...

1459
01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:37.404
do you accept Diego

1460
01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:40.365
as your lawfully wedded husband.

1461
01:33:40.449 --> 01:33:44.494
to love and respect him

1462
01:33:44.578 --> 01:33:47.706
till death do you part?

1463
01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:09.770
No.

1464
01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:10.896
What?

1465
01:34:12.272 --> 01:34:13.482
My God.

1466
01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:16.193
Sorry.

1467
01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:18.236
Sorry. Father.

1468
01:34:19.613 --> 01:34:21.907
Forgive me. Diego.
I can't marry you like this.

1469
01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:24.117
Martina.

1470
01:34:25.035 --> 01:34:26.203
My name is not Lucía.

1471
01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:28.288
My name is Lupe.

1472
01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:30.123
From Guadalupe.

1473
01:34:30.207 --> 01:34:31.249
I am Mexican...

1474
01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:33.543
and vegetarian.

1475
01:34:34.336 --> 01:34:36.296
And all of this is a lie. it is a farce.

1476
01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:38.340
We don't know anyone here.

1477
01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:41.134
No one here is family or friends.

1478
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.470
The two of them are my friends.

1479
01:34:43.929 --> 01:34:46.765
although I don't think they will be
after what I'm about to confess.

1480
01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:50.227
Diego is very cute.

1481
01:34:51.686 --> 01:34:53.647
He is to die for.

1482
01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:56.525
But he lacks guts.

1483
01:34:57.818 --> 01:34:58.985
Father. excuse me.

1484
01:34:59.069 --> 01:35:02.030
You can hand me the list of
Our Fathers that I'll have to pray

1485
01:35:02.114 --> 01:35:05.075
so we can get even.

1486
01:35:06.952 --> 01:35:07.786
Diego is scared.

1487
01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:10.080
He is very afraid of letting her down.

1488
01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:11.873
Martina. sorry...

1489
01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.127
but he's panicking that
you won't accept him

1490
01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.379
when all he wants is for you
to be proud of him.

1491
01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:23.593
And what am I doing here in all this?

1492
01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:25.303
I pretended...

1493
01:35:26.388 --> 01:35:27.973
I pretended that Diego wanted me here

1494
01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:30.100
when I knew he didn't.

1495
01:35:30.851 --> 01:35:32.561
But that's what I do. I pretend.

1496
01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:35.730
I pretended until I got it. and I got it.

1497
01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.025
I pretended I was a bartender
until I made it.

1498
01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:41.987
I told my friends
I had money to invest in a bar.

1499
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:45.907
promising them money from my dad.

1500
01:35:46.533 --> 01:35:47.742
but I don't have a dad.

1501
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:49.453
I have no family.

1502
01:35:50.579 --> 01:35:54.499
Tona is the closest thing I've ever had
to a family. and it was all fake.

1503
01:35:56.877 --> 01:35:58.211
If I faked all this...

1504
01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:02.507
it wasn't because I thought
you and I had a thing.

1505
01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:07.012
I faked it because I made a bet
with my friends...

1506
01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:09.264
with my remaining shares of the bar...

1507
01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:11.933
that I could make you
fall in love with me.

1508
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:22.819
Forgive me.

1509
01:36:41.922 --> 01:36:43.965
No. where are the keys?

1510
01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:46.051
-No--
-Lu!

1511
01:36:47.052 --> 01:36:47.886
No. no.

1512
01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:50.138
I know I'm not what you expected.
Sorry.

1513
01:36:50.222 --> 01:36:53.391
And that I am a farce.
that you no longer want to be my friends.

1514
01:36:53.475 --> 01:36:55.185
Don't talk nonsense.
Guadalupe.

1515
01:36:55.268 --> 01:36:57.938
There is nothing to forgive.
We are your best friends.

1516
01:36:58.021 --> 01:36:59.564
We are your partners.

1517
01:37:00.065 --> 01:37:01.525
We are your family.

1518
01:37:01.608 --> 01:37:03.902
You are very brave. baby.
Very brave.

1519
01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:08.740
Can you get out?

1520
01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:12.869
The front door is locked. and
if I don't get in first. I can't drive.

1521
01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:18.750
-Oh. Tona.
-Come.

1522
01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:23.338
Forgive me for getting you into all this.
It's not fair.

1523
01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:24.506
No.

1524
01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:27.592
Being your father has been
the best role of my life.

1525
01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.940
-Hey.
-Let's go!

1526
01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:43.024
Inside. inside.

1527
01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:47.362
Let's go.

1528
01:37:47.445 --> 01:37:49.114
No. not my ass!

1529
01:37:51.408 --> 01:37:52.993
Hold on tight.

1530
01:37:53.493 --> 01:37:56.413
Babe. are you the groom?
I mean. because of how you look.

1531
01:37:56.496 --> 01:37:59.749
-Yes.
-They told me the wedding was called off.

1532
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:03.211
Well. I don't know
if I should congratulate you.

1533
01:38:03.295 --> 01:38:05.797
I'm just telling you. you have to pay me

1534
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.676
every penny for all the work
we've done. We belong to a union.

1535
01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:11.469
-Did you understand that?
-Yes.

1536
01:38:11.553 --> 01:38:12.512
Done deal.

1537
01:38:12.596 --> 01:38:13.888
Hey. extras!

1538
01:38:13.972 --> 01:38:15.890
The wedding has been called off.

1539
01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:18.977
Let's go to the van. I'm in a rush.

1540
01:39:32.342 --> 01:39:33.468
What's going on?

1541
01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:36.680
Why did everyone lie to me? Why?

1542
01:39:36.763 --> 01:39:41.351
I've always felt there was
something weird with Lu.

1543
01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:44.854
And have you thought that
it was your son who lied to you?

1544
01:39:46.106 --> 01:39:47.023
Martina.

1545
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:51.319
Didn't it occur to you
that your son lied to you?

1546
01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:54.489
She is no longer in Argentina.

1547
01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:57.075
-No.
-And her name is not Lu.

1548
01:39:57.617 --> 01:39:59.077
My name is not Tona. either.

1549
01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:02.163
My name is Tonatiuh.

1550
01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:05.250
Tonatiuh?

1551
01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:08.253
That's right. nice to meet you.

1552
01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:12.632
Tonatiuh.

1553
01:40:15.468 --> 01:40:17.595
And Lu and I are Mexican.

1554
01:40:37.615 --> 01:40:40.034
Listen to me very clearly.
I have instructions

1555
01:40:40.118 --> 01:40:42.203
to not let anyone pass.

1556
01:40:42.912 --> 01:40:45.081
And I'm determined to say
that you can't go.

1557
01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.500
-No. no.
-Please!

1558
01:40:47.584 --> 01:40:49.669
-But. please.
-Enough!

1559
01:40:49.753 --> 01:40:51.045
-Stop it!
-No.

1560
01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:54.758
This is my mom. Diana.

1561
01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:58.720
What's happening?

1562
01:41:08.146 --> 01:41:08.980
Look. Diego...

1563
01:41:09.939 --> 01:41:12.275
all my life I fought to be respected...

1564
01:41:14.319 --> 01:41:16.154
but I never fought to be loved.

1565
01:41:18.615 --> 01:41:20.533
Can we talk. please. son?

1566
01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:28.792
Your drinks.

1567
01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:29.834
Thank you.

1568
01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:33.296
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

1569
01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:35.256
Tequila?

1570
01:41:36.174 --> 01:41:37.509
Did you order tequila?

1571
01:41:38.802 --> 01:41:40.470
I fell in love with tequila.

1572
01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:44.557
I want to tell you that I feel very silly.

1573
01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:51.314
Because I always suspected Lu's accent

1574
01:41:51.564 --> 01:41:52.565
was weird.

1575
01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:58.029
I would have loved if all that story
you made up was real.

1576
01:41:59.197 --> 01:42:01.407
And I went looking for you because...

1577
01:42:01.491 --> 01:42:05.036
I wanted to tell you
that you are not a failure.

1578
01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:08.915
I don't know. all my life...

1579
01:42:10.333 --> 01:42:11.543
you worked very hard

1580
01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:13.753
-to list all the times I failed.
-No.

1581
01:42:13.837 --> 01:42:18.132
I listed the times
you didn't fight for what you wanted.

1582
01:42:20.343 --> 01:42:22.971
That's why I beg you
to fight for love this time.

1583
01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:25.849
Fight.

1584
01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:29.561
Diego...

1585
01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:30.979
What?

1586
01:42:31.688 --> 01:42:34.691
I love you with my heart and soul.

1587
01:42:36.276 --> 01:42:37.902
I love you. old lady.

1588
01:42:37.986 --> 01:42:40.572
You are so handsome. Be strong.

1589
01:42:42.991 --> 01:42:44.576
Cheers.

1590
01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:52.375
Harsh.

1591
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.043
Like life.

1592
01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.014
DELETE PHOTO

1593
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:10.935
Oh. girl.

1594
01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.062
I don't like to see you like this.

1595
01:43:13.146 --> 01:43:15.857
Dull. sad. disillusioned.

1596
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.774
Blue.

1597
01:43:19.027 --> 01:43:21.195
Believe it or not.
I learned a lot from him.

1598
01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:25.950
Hey. didn't you catch that disease?

1599
01:43:26.034 --> 01:43:29.746
The hostage who falls in love
with the kidnapper.

1600
01:43:30.538 --> 01:43:32.749
-It's called...
-"Stockhole" Syndrome.

1601
01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:34.083
Stockholm.

1602
01:43:34.167 --> 01:43:36.210
But no. not at all.

1603
01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.464
I decided to go there.
He didn't force me.

1604
01:43:40.298 --> 01:43:42.008
There were a lot of bad decisions.

1605
01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:44.260
-from both of us.
-Equally.

1606
01:43:44.761 --> 01:43:46.095
That's right.

1607
01:43:46.179 --> 01:43:47.597
Hello. who is Lu?

1608
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.514
Me.

1609
01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:50.975
Someone asked me to deliver this to you.

1610
01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:54.979
JAIME SABINES
LOVE POEMS

1611
01:44:03.613 --> 01:44:05.198
LU. CAN YOU COME OUT?

1612
01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:23.132
The whole of you comes to meet me

1613
01:44:23.883 --> 01:44:26.094
And for a moment we both disappear

1614
01:44:26.761 --> 01:44:28.888
We get into the mouth of God

1615
01:44:28.972 --> 01:44:31.683
Until I tell you I'm hungry or sleepy

1616
01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:36.980
Every day I love you
And I hate you irremediably

1617
01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.196
Diego. what are you doing here?

1618
01:44:46.531 --> 01:44:50.034
The difficult part was not
choosing the poem. The difficult part...

1619
01:44:51.244 --> 01:44:54.747
was choosing the words to say
when I had you in front of me.

1620
01:44:56.708 --> 01:44:57.542
Lu...

1621
01:44:59.585 --> 01:45:02.922
you made me see that my life
had reached a point of no return.

1622
01:45:03.923 --> 01:45:05.508
And since I met you...

1623
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.636
my life changed.

1624
01:45:10.513 --> 01:45:12.265
When I said yes during the wedding.

1625
01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:16.019
I wasn't faking it. It was true.
I want to marry you.

1626
01:45:16.227 --> 01:45:17.061
It's for real.

1627
01:45:19.188 --> 01:45:22.817
I can't ask you to marry me now
because I sold the ring.

1628
01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:26.696
and gave my mom the money back.
And I sold the bookstore...

1629
01:45:26.779 --> 01:45:27.989
and everything else.

1630
01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:30.533
-You did what?
-I sold everything.

1631
01:45:32.035 --> 01:45:35.830
In the end you were right when you told me
that I would surely end up...

1632
01:45:35.913 --> 01:45:36.831
living in Mexico.

1633
01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:40.209
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1634
01:45:41.627 --> 01:45:44.047
But I know what I came here for.

1635
01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:45.339
To fight for you.

1636
01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:49.302
Are you going to say anything?

1637
01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:54.932
When things aren't perfect.
what are you going to do?

1638
01:45:56.559 --> 01:45:57.393
I'll fight.

1639
01:45:58.102 --> 01:46:00.438
I'll fight with much more desire.

1640
01:46:01.731 --> 01:46:02.648
What about you?

1641
01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:24.629
I'm so happy that I've arrived

1642
01:46:24.712 --> 01:46:26.214
To the right place

1643
01:46:27.006 --> 01:46:28.800
My mother sent them.
as a gift.

1644
01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:30.718
She doesn't hate
Mexicans anymore?

1645
01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:33.596
No. in fact. it's quite the opposite.

1646
01:46:35.348 --> 01:46:36.265
-Tona?
-Tona.

1647
01:46:36.766 --> 01:46:39.268
Yes. but let's not talk about it. please.

1648
01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:54.992
If you want something
with all the desire in the world.

1649
01:46:55.076 --> 01:46:57.411
the universe conspires to give it to you.

1650
01:46:57.495 --> 01:46:58.746
Do you remember that?

1651
01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:01.958
Lu Sanchez. do you take Diego Quiroga
as your husband?

1652
01:47:07.171 --> 01:47:08.297
Yes. I do.

1653
01:47:08.381 --> 01:47:10.758
And by the power vested in me by the law.

1654
01:47:10.842 --> 01:47:13.886
I pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

1655
01:53:17.458 --> 01:53:21.545
Do you know why Argentines go out
in the street during electrical storms?

1656
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:22.880
Why?

1657
01:53:22.963 --> 01:53:25.883
Because they believe
God is photographing them.

1658
01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:28.886
Well done.

1659
01:53:28.969 --> 01:53:30.721
Do you know why Mexicans

1660
01:53:30.804 --> 01:53:33.015
-don't go to the Olympics?
-Why?

1661
01:53:33.098 --> 01:53:37.478
Because all those who can run and swim
have already crossed to the United States.

1662
01:53:42.525 --> 01:53:44.985
Want to hear something that's not a joke?

1663
01:53:47.238 --> 01:53:48.489
I love you.

1664
01:53:49.073 --> 01:53:50.324
I love you too.

1665
01:53:56.205 --> 01:53:57.790
Long live Mexico!

1666
01:53:58.415 --> 01:54:00.543
-Long live Argentina!
-That's right!

1667
01:54:01.293 --> 01:54:02.336
Cheers!
