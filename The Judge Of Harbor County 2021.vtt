00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.350
- [James] One night.

5
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.923
I had a dream.

6
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.740
The problem I got right now

7
00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:07.110
is some days

8
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.930
I couldn't tell you if I
ever woke up from that dream.

9
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.788
(soft haunting music)

10
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.373
See one day.

11
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.853
I found a watch.

12
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.780
Next to it was a US Marshal badge

13
00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:35.683
and a sign:

14
00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:38.390
"Town

15
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.830
needs

16
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.957
a marshall."

17
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.933
Next to that sign was a hat.

18
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.763
Yeah. I needed me a hat.

19
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.793
But I couldn't take my
eyes from that watch.

20
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.603
Then I read the back of the sign:

21
00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:00.859
"Lotta dead people around here."

22
00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:01.692
Hmm.

23
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.143
I coulda told you that one for free.

24
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.223
look at things a different way.

25
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.860
Hell.

26
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.783
I'm one of 'em.

27
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.283
My name was Clinton Butler.

28
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.493
Whole town considered me dead.

29
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.010
But the good Dr. Roth

30
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.473
oversaw the documents
of my official rebirth.

31
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.633
And after a year clawin'
my way back from the dead.

32
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.663
Marshal James Jennings I became.

33
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.513
I don't know if this was my punishment.

34
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.763
I don't know if this is
my heaven or my hell.

35
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.693
but it seems like I found
that watch 1.000 times over.

36
00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:56.860
(soft haunting music)

37
00:05:04.922 --> 00:05:08.089
(dark haunting music)

38
00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:15.030
(eerie chattering)

39
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.280
(eerie haunting music)

40
00:05:28.312 --> 00:05:33.312
(dark mystical music)
(chair creaking)

41
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.070
In 1861. in the vicinity of Helena. Texas.

42
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.210
a few rough acres of woodland

43
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.510
were described by their
solitary inhabitant

44
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.043
as Harbour County.

45
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.070
Reports suggested a small homestead

46
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.633
sat somewhere on the land.

47
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.580
Those who found it and
set foot in the property

48
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.920
were considered to be the guests

49
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.713
of US Marshal James Jennings.

50
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.380
Stories of the mysterious marshal grew.

51
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.270
He became infamous amongst outlaws

52
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.380
who claimed they had killed him

53
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.593
in the town of Goliad years previously.

54
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.600
In the summer months.

55
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.720
a crude rope lined the
boundary of Harbor County.

56
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.010
By the onset of winter.

57
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.023
only a single sign to the
residence would be found.

58
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.393
(dark mysterious music)

59
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.793
Inside Redemption.

60
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.540
a man could attest

61
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.658
or disprove his sins.

62
00:06:59.658 --> 00:07:02.991
(dark mysterious music)

63
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.263
- Mr. Jennings.

64
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.800
not sure how long this one's got.

65
00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:26.143
Looks to me like she's done for.

66
00:07:26.143 --> 00:07:29.310
(dark haunting music)

67
00:07:31.887 --> 00:07:34.804
(Susanna coughing)

68
00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:05.360
(Susanna coughing)

69
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.623
- He tried to take me in the barn.

70
00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:14.027
I have been right.

71
00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:16.649
He didn't believe me

72
00:08:17.877 --> 00:08:18.710
and he.

73
00:08:21.337 --> 00:08:22.813
- You take my word:

74
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.280
I give you vengeance

75
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.223
and I'll make your husband sweat.

76
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.523
- You're a good man. James.

77
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:39.913
The sorta man I shoulda married.

78
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.160
Make him suffer. Mr. Jennings.

79
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.163
He's a bad man.

80
00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:52.230
- So you gonna talk. my friend?

81
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.603
Hell. you must be on fire down there.

82
00:08:56.924 --> 00:09:00.070
(chuckles softly) Now I challenge
any regular-speakin' man

83
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.850
to sit in that chair with
untreated venereal disease

84
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.130
of the highest order

85
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.380
and not say

86
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.520
a word.

87
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.400
- Please. show me the
compassion you're famed for.

88
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.613
- We are not in the land
of hospitality here.

89
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.403
I know things. Mr. Cooper.

90
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.790
- What do you know?

91
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.543
- She took to whorin'
herself to get back at you.

92
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.380
- That's not true.

93
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.213
I'll tell ya.

94
00:09:28.213 --> 00:09:31.003
- You accused those boys of raping her

95
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.373
when they did nothin' of the sort.

96
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.013
They thought it was paid for.

97
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.350
- I never agreed to that.

98
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.020
They're making that up.

99
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.070
Wait. there ain't nothing
wrong with me. Mr. Jennings

100
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.807
- Did you rape your wife?

101
00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:48.510
- Are you playin' mind games with me?

102
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.150
- Did the blade go in before

103
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.410
or after?

104
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.510
- I'm an innocent man.

105
00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.180
- That's the tragedy of death. I'm afraid.

106
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.927
- We had an argument a few days back.

107
00:10:01.927 --> 00:10:03.620
but I ain't seen much of her.

108
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.130
- When I got there.

109
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.073
Susanna come 'round.

110
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.610
I told her Dr. Roth would
be a good couple hours away.

111
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.530
but we could cauterise
the wound. all that.

112
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.970
But

113
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.033
she'd bled.

114
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.253
She'd bled good.

115
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.770
So she sat there

116
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.627
and she said.

117
00:10:30.627 --> 00:10:32.853
"Find my husband.

118
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.360
I won't die until you brought
that bastard in front of me."

119
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.183
Give her some honour in death.

120
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.743
She's dead.

121
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.660
Just acknowledge that
you probably behind it.

122
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.810
- I'll make a deal with you.

123
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.602
I'll sit here like this.

124
00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:56.510
No pains. no crying

125
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.980
and you'll see there ain't
nothing wrong with me

126
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.110
which will prove that I
did not do what you claim.

127
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.840
- I'll give you eight
days to think about this.

128
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.350
Now if you can sit there for
eight days and not demonstrate

129
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.360
a symptom of the disease

130
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.083
that I know will be ravaging your body.

131
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.870
then you a free man

132
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.560
and I am the devil for subjecting you

133
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.103
to such a torture.

134
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.840
Might be a good idea to shut
your eyes for a little bit.

135
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.173
Get some rest.

136
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.290
I don't want you wakin' up with no fever.

137
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.210
I don't wanna get you well
just to then watch you hang.

138
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.860
- You ain't never hanged
a person in your life.

139
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.590
- Is that the compassion I'm famed for?

140
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.370
- That's what they say.

141
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.120
You give people a chance
to prove themselves.

142
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.573
- Stay alive long enough. you'll find out.

143
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.853
Now your eight days.

144
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.761
they begin now.

145
00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:59.928
(soft haunting music)

146
00:12:06.714 --> 00:12:09.881
(dark haunting music)

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:53.383
♪ Down by the river ♪

148
00:13:53.383 --> 00:13:56.237

153
00:14:15.828 --> 00:14:16.983
I didn't stab her.

154
00:14:18.285 --> 00:14:21.560
I don't know why people
think that I would do that.

155
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.308
She's my wife. you know?
(dead man coughing)

156
00:14:23.308 --> 00:14:26.320
I don't know why people would
think I was gonna do that.

157
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.153
- [Dead Man] Shut up.

158
00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:28.250
- [William] I don't know why

159
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.420
everybody would've thought
I woulda done that.

160
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.980
but it wasn't me.

161
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.173
I mean she's my wife.

162
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.003
- (coughs) Shut up!

163
00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:40.373
- [William] (sighs) Nobody
wants to listen to me.

164
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.320
not even a dead man.

165
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.487
(soft haunting music)

166
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.713
- Eight days.

167
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.080
Why'd you put yourself
through that. Mr. Cooper?

168
00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.300
- Because I don't think a word

169
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.263
about what they say about you is true.

170
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.113
- And now you know I am a man of my word.

171
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.710
When am I gonna hang then?

172
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.750
- You're not gonna hang. Coop.

173
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.670
See. I challenged you.

174
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.580
I said. "Any man that can sit there

175
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.630
with venereal disease of the highest order

176
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.950
for eight days

177
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.010
and not show any symptoms

178
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.277
can walk free."

179
00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:33.623
I don't like you.

180
00:15:33.623 --> 00:15:36.283
I don't enjoy the
pleasure of your company.

181
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.500
But two things happened

182
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.163
before I pulled you in
that you were unaware of.

183
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.010
You have a house girl called Callie.

184
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.760
Is that correct?

185
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.130
- What she got to do with all this?

186
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.400
- Well Callie has been the
recipient of your desire

187
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.658
for the past year. has she not?

188
00:15:56.658 --> 00:16:00.170
(soft intriguing music)

189
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.640
- Yeah.

190
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.723
- Don't mind me sayin'. but
she ain't exactly purty.

191
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.580
- No. she's ugly as sin.

192
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.563
But the only person who
has lain with her is me.

193
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.240
- And Susanna caught you.
waited for you to clean up.

194
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.640
then confronted you.

195
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.550
- I'll never rape Susanna.

196
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.550
I never stabbed her.

197
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.560
I've been here eight days.

198
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.660
Do you not believe me?

199
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.963
- No. I believe you.

200
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.090
It's the rest of the town that don't.

201
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.090
You'd have been hanged a week
ago if I hadn't pulled you in.

202
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.850
You betrayed your wife

203
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.770
and she got back at
you by openin' her legs

204
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.663
to the whole of the town.

205
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.800
You're the man who's gotta live with that.

206
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.810
- What I do next?

207
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.683
- We hanged William Cooper a week ago.

208
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.753
I inspected your property.

209
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.000
I found a will that you recently signed

210
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.210
leavin' your estate to Callie Mitchell.

211
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:10.160
But seizing all cash assets to deal with:

212
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.840
your funeral $20.

213
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.047
unpaid wages

214
00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:16.690
$680.

215
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.367
unpaid bar tab

216
00:17:18.367 --> 00:17:19.713
$16.

217
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.310
general store payments in lieu $410

218
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.530
and a clerk's fee for the remainder.

219
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.170
Approximately $3.400

220
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.890
for landholdings.

221
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.050
identifications

222
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.640
and passage

223
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.303
to a new world.

224
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.350
- You liquidated my business.

225
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.510
- Nope.

226
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.270
we just paid up what you owed

227
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.290
and we got you a one-way ticket

228
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:54.020
to not bein' annihilated by a bayin' mob

229
00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.540
who were quite prepared
to pull you to pieces.

230
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.157
- You're for real. aren't you?

231
00:17:59.157 --> 00:18:00.863
- You see this guy in front of me?

232
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.123
I walked I don't know
how long to find him.

233
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.200
I dragged his sorry ass back here

234
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.200
because rumour is this man is
worth a hell of a lotta money.

235
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.760
- I was a rich man before
I walked into this place.

236
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.970
- You're richer now. believe me.

237
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.710
- Yeah. I'm starting to think that way.

238
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.543
So

239
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:30.950
what next?

240
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.860
- Get yourself together.

241
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.130
Have a look in that bag

242
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.903
and understand why you came to Redemption.

243
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.050
- My folks left England for a better life.

244
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.223
- William Cooper is
leaving for a better life.

245
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.420
one where he ain't dead.

246
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.420
- How'd you fix all this so quick?

247
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.663
- Wise up. Mr. Cooper.

248
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.880
You a healthy man.

249
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.210
You start walkin' South

250
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.020
and y'all hit the coastline
in about three days

251
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.270
if you get yourself down

252
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.563
to what they now calling Corpus Christi.

253
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.380
Go East and y'all hit Galveston.

254
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.340
But that's about seven or eight days walk.

255
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.100
So maybe you wanna pick up a horse.

256
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.210
let it loose on the
outskirts when you get there.

257
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.029
But don't be tradin'

258
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.529
'cause you a dead man walkin'.

259
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.880
- You got this all figured out. ain't ya?

260
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.560
- I got this figured out
same way for everybody.

261
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.853
Hell. you're home free.

262
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.890
Even if you jump a steam
ship takes you to New York.

263
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.380
that don't matter.

264
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.800
You just find another one headin'
home to queen and country.

265
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.400
- Bein' dead has a price

266
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.500
- That it does. Mr. Cooper.

267
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.610
That it does.

268
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.150
- So you're just gonna let me go?

269
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.980
- Yeah. we had our talk.

270
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.070
Life has moved on.

271
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.369
Hell. you're dad the only one

272
00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.460
who might've had a beef with you.

273
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.800
You got a piece of paper that
says you are somebody else

274
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.050
and you got a death
certificate and documents

275
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.193
that relate to a family friend.

276
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.380
- A week ago. I had everything.

277
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.770
Now I've got nothing.

278
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.913
- You been redeemed.

279
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.353
Now get out.

280
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.273
- Wait. you never bought me any shoes.

281
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.483
- Well shoot.

282
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.533
Have mine.

283
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.380
I can't help you with that. Cooper.

284
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.170
Why don't you ask the dead man
here if he'll lend you his?

285
00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:35.390
- Oh. be reasonable.

286
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.740
It's freezin' out there.

287
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.850
Well then improvise

288
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.643
or ask the dead man.

289
00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:45.693
- (sighs) Can I take your shoes?

290
00:20:48.387 --> 00:20:49.633
- $20.

291
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.633
I want a burial.

292
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.080
Jennings can't pay that for me.

293
00:20:59.247 --> 00:21:00.080
- $20.

294
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:06.210
That boy is thinking ahead. (chuckles)

295
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.300
- That it?

296
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.313
Can I go now?

297
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.773
- [James] Pay him the $20.

298
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.280
Put it in his hand or put
it in his shirt pocket.

299
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.130
- Why?

300
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.830
You're only gonna take it off him.

301
00:21:18.568 --> 00:21:20.113
- I want my shoes back.

302
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.730
- [James] Man wants his shoes back. Coop.

303
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.483
- I want my shoes back.

304
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.790
- Look. I'm puttin' $40 in his hand.

305
00:21:38.219 --> 00:21:39.469
- I don't care.

306
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.263
I want my shoes back.

307
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.960
40's not enough.

308
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.017
100.

309
00:21:47.017 --> 00:21:50.184
(soft haunting music)

310
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.135
- [James] You're not 60 short are you?

311
00:21:54.135 --> 00:21:54.968
- No.

312
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.240
Look.

313
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.370
here's a $100

314
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.940
for this man's shoes.

315
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.273
Thank you. dead man.

316
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.673
- Next time. just pull a dead
man's shoes off his feet.

317
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.757
I stopped feelin' my legs hours ago.

318
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.770
- What did he say?

319
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.940
- He said next time.

320
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.170
just pull a dead man's shoes off his feet.

321
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.323
He stopped feelin' his legs hours ago.

322
00:22:22.323 --> 00:22:24.333
- I want my $100 back.

323
00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:26.984
- Nuh-uh.

324
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.213
That man is next in that chair.

325
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.033
Redemption has a price. Mr. Cooper.

326
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.260
More money you have comin' in.

327
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.540
the better your chances
are of gettin' out.

328
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.565
Got it?

329
00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:44.898
(soft intriguing music)

330
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.348
- I need water.

331
00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:12.214
(soft haunting music)

332
00:23:12.214 --> 00:23:13.047
Water.

333
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:23.090
- I could give you water.

334
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.610
But we live in parts where
they sell liquor by the keg

335
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.960
because it's cheaper than water.

336
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.610
But I can give you

337
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.523
water.

338
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.370
So

339
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.663
what's your name?

340
00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:47.686
(cup clanking)

341
00:23:47.686 --> 00:23:49.113
- You sold him my shoes.

342
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.290
- [James] What's your name?

343
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.640
I thought you knew Leyland.

344
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.557
- My name isn't important.

345
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.383
You'll kill me if I tell you.

346
00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:06.940
but I know Leyland.

347
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.110
- [James] Prove it to me.

348
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.297
- Leyland saw his father hanged.

349
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.513
Look.

350
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.023
there's gonna be a Confederate
man comin' for you.

351
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.373
He's an imposter.

352
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:27.780
- [James] Imposter.

353
00:24:28.777 --> 00:24:31.033
You know of this imposter's name?

354
00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:36.041
- It's Jacob Fulford.

355
00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:38.853
- [James] Jacob Fulford.

356
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:40.103
So the name.

357
00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.587
You knowin' the name of the imposter.

358
00:24:41.587 --> 00:24:43.920
but you can't tell me yours.

359
00:24:46.312 --> 00:24:48.812
- You'd kill me if I tell you.

360
00:24:54.027 --> 00:24:57.037
- [James] Well I think
you's done for. my friend.

361
00:24:57.037 --> 00:25:00.370
(soft mysterious music)

362
00:25:02.312 --> 00:25:07.312
You know. my friend. that
I have a gift. don't you?

363
00:25:07.343 --> 00:25:08.883
You know that I can hear you.

364
00:25:10.255 --> 00:25:12.173
I can translate your thoughts.

365
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.753
And I think all you wanna say is this:

366
00:25:19.947 --> 00:25:23.853
"Why wouldn't you just
let me die in peace?

367
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.180
I wouldna have last through
the night in that cold.

368
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.810
but you bring me here with your vengeance

369
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.450
and your talk of redemption.

370
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.713
Hell. I am redeemed.

371
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.213
I'm a bad man."

372
00:25:41.213 --> 00:25:43.180
But a bad man dies

373
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.844
the same way he lives

374
00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:46.993
(cup clanking)

375
00:25:46.993 --> 00:25:48.160
in the gutter.

376
00:25:51.734 --> 00:25:54.401
(dark rumbling)

377
00:26:10.377 --> 00:26:12.538
(rain trickling)
(owl hooting)

378
00:26:12.538 --> 00:26:15.705
(dark military music)

379
00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:31.468
(eerie reverent music)
(owl hooting)

380
00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:03.479
(wind whooshing)

381
00:27:12.504 --> 00:27:15.754
(eerie reverent music)

382
00:27:34.682 --> 00:27:37.265
(wind howling)

383
00:28:28.422 --> 00:28:33.422
(dark reverent music)
(wind howling)

384
00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:03.765
(dark intriguing music)

385
00:29:53.157 --> 00:29:55.327
(liquid trickling)

386
00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:58.244
(glasses clinking)

387
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.147
(eerie mysterious music)

388
00:31:15.176 --> 00:31:18.109
- [Rosanna] (knocks) Mr. Jennings.

389
00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:20.359
Mr. Jennings. it's Rosanna.

390
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.435
(soft haunting music)

391
00:31:23.435 --> 00:31:26.102
(James sighing)

392
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.200
- I know who you are.

393
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.760
You the devil tauntin' me
on this strange night. girl?

394
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.193
- [Rosanna] You gotta help.

395
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.540
- I don't

396
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.063
gotta help.

397
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.070
- [Rosanna] Leyland and
Elisha are comin' here.

398
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.133
Jacob Fulford and his
gang are huntin' them.

399
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.680
- You seen that man outside?

400
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.142
- [Rosanna] Which one.

401
00:31:55.142 --> 00:31:58.853
the one who was yellin' or
the dyin' one on the porch?

402
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.493
- The dyin' one.

403
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.930
He said Fulford and his gang

404
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.443
are union imposters.

405
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.983
Look. I can't keep that man alive.

406
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:13.723
This?

407
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.283
This is Redemption.

408
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.363
This ain't a hospital.

409
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.000
- Well Leyland and Elisha
are comin' with a doctor.

410
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.727
so maybe you should drag him back inside

411
00:32:25.727 --> 00:32:28.768
and I can see what I
can do to attend to him.

412
00:32:28.768 --> 00:32:31.433
If he ain't dead. you
can't leave him outside.

413
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.842
not with this storm comin'.

414
00:32:34.842 --> 00:32:39.842
- Well (sighs) I guess you
better get yourself inside then.

415
00:32:40.607 --> 00:32:45.003
(liquid trickling)
(glasses clinking)

416
00:32:45.003 --> 00:32:48.170
(soft haunting music)

417
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.683
You see that man outside. Rosanna?

418
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.043
He's better off dead.

419
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:17.250
I mean I'll put the knife
to him myself I have to.

420
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.643
I mean that's harsh

421
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:20.963
but humane.

422
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.953
He's like a lame horse.

423
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.060
He ain't gonna pull through.

424
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.180
See. this room?

425
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.393
This room is justice.

426
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.540
It exists

427
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.880
so the thieves

428
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.850
and lawbreakers

429
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.473
can have some kinda reckoning.

430
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.710
But at dawn.

431
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.150
hell. we're gonna have
one swayin' Jacob Fulford

432
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.713
returnin' to settle a score with me.

433
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.313
Do you understand?

434
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.010
I mean when he comes back

435
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.360
this time.

436
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.773
he'll be prepared.

437
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.200
- You're drunk.

438
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.300
Sober.

439
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.283
you'd never be scared of
Jacob Fulford and his gang.

440
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.750
Mr. Jennings. before you bought
this place and this acre.

441
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.810
this was my family home.

442
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:19.963
Did you know that?

443
00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.930
I mean I'm shocked that you call it

444
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.610
Harbour County and Redemption and all.

445
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.670
but I was only a little girl

446
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.203
before my family moved
that mile away into town.

447
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.920
You weren't originally
from Karnes. were ya?

448
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.560
No. my daddy said you
were from Goliad County.

449
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.070
Is that right?

450
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:45.070
He said you were a religious
man who strived for order.

451
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.520
- Well bless your daddy

452
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.363
he speaks the truth.

453
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.130
Yes.

454
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.193
I strive for order.

455
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.200
To a certain extent.

456
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.753
I am a religious man.

457
00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.543
I am from Goliad County.

458
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.980
but I fail to see what your connection

459
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.660
with my land has to do

460
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.820
with the massacre

461
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.060
we may find ourselves the victims of.

462
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.740
- Oh we won't be the victims
of no massacre. Mr. Jennings.

463
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.577
We came here to hide.

464
00:35:23.577 --> 00:35:27.347
- (chuckles) Well good luck hidin'.

465
00:35:28.262 --> 00:35:30.540
- Can I go through to
your private quarters?

466
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.610
- I only got two rooms in this place.

467
00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.223
I wouldn't call either
one of them private.

468
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.250
but you go right ahead.

469
00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.064
You go look.

470
00:35:41.064 --> 00:35:44.231
(soft haunting music)

471
00:35:58.573 --> 00:36:01.323
(board grinding)

472
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:08.763
- [Rosanna] Can you hear me?

473
00:36:11.524 --> 00:36:13.080
- [James] Rosanna. where'd you go?

474
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.740
- [Rosanna] Mr. Jennings. I'm right here.

475
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.088
Can you not hear me?

476
00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:21.255
(soft haunting music)

477
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.613
- Rosanna.

478
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.187
where did you just go?

479
00:36:31.509 --> 00:36:33.648
- The ice store.

480
00:36:33.648 --> 00:36:35.187
You did know there's an ice
store under here. didn't ya?

481
00:36:39.007 --> 00:36:40.340
- An ice store?

482
00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.032
Well

483
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.360
I know I got one now you told me.

484
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.550
How'd you get in it?

485
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.220
- Move the bed. lift the boards

486
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.313
and you can step on down
into the abyss. Mr. Jennings.

487
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.430
Now we'll be hidin' on down there

488
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.473
and you can do your shootin' up here.

489
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.380
- So you came to hide
in a part of my place

490
00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.300
that I didn't even know existed?

491
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.520
- Well my daddy dug it out.
kinda a secret and all.

492
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.760
The man you bought the land
from. well he's dead now.

493
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.830
But he harassed my daddy
for it for quite some time.

494
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.250
He thought there was somethin' of value

495
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.990
in the ground 'round here.

496
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.590
Oil. I think.

497
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.860
There wasn't. not here.

498
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.860
But before daddy sold on. he
satisfied his own curiosity.

499
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.940
He spent two summers diggin' a hole.

500
00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.760
big as a house and then bigger still.

501
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.400
It's hard rock. so cool too.

502
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.920
Nice hideaway from the sun.

503
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.390
But daddy didn't want no
one knowin' about the hole

504
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.220
and he was a good carpenter.

505
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.120
So he laid up a new floor.

506
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.000
You can't even tell there's
anythin' under there.

507
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.310
- Why didn't you just tell
me this before. Rosanna?

508
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.683
- Well I didn't really know you. did I?

509
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.483
I still don't.

510
00:38:02.483 --> 00:38:04.830
I never had no reason
to tell you anythin'.

511
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.010
but I never had no one

512
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.330
chasin' and beatin' up my family before.

513
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.980
Never had no reason to hide.

514
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.140
But now I do find myself
with reason to hide.

515
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.990
I will hide in the best place I know.

516
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.823
- Look.

517
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.023
I got liquor and I got cups.

518
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.400
So why don't you take a seat

519
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.343
and we'll sit this one out?

520
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:43.593
That chair is reserved for lawbreakers.

521
00:38:44.465 --> 00:38:47.240
(dark foreboding music)

522
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.690
- It's a chair. Mr. Jennings.

523
00:38:49.558 --> 00:38:51.870
You're gonna make me sit on the floor?

524
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:55.203
(dark foreboding music)

525
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.500
- Now weren't you gonna
attend to that corpse outside.

526
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.333
I mean

527
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.883
if he's still alive that he is?

528
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.997
I just got no use for him in here.

529
00:39:12.997 --> 00:39:16.330
(dark foreboding music)

530
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.453
- Mr. Jennings.

531
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.173
I think he's dead.

532
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.293
- Oh. you think he's
dead? (chuckles softly)

533
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.390
Yeah. I thought he was dead.

534
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:43.300
I mean I was damn convinced he was dead.

535
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.410
But if I didn't drag him
a couple of hundred yards

536
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:47.993
back to this place.

537
00:39:49.187 --> 00:39:51.490
then I coulda been sleepin' in my bed

538
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.670
and Jacob Fulford woulda crept up on me

539
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.253
and slit my throat whilst I slept.

540
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.607
So the doctor definitely comin'?

541
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:17.140
- Yes. Dr. Roth from Goliad
County like yourself.

542
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.460
Oh. she don't like it 'round here.

543
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.443
Says the injuries remind her
of bein' on the battlefield.

544
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.150
- You know they started this
new way of settlin' scores

545
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.983
amongst the thieves in town?

546
00:40:28.983 --> 00:40:32.844
(soft intriguing music)

547
00:40:32.844 --> 00:40:36.173
They'd tie a pair of 'em
together. buckskin at the arm.

548
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.973
And they put a little one-inch
blade into their hands.

549
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.330
And the bettin' in the circle intensifies

550
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.113
then the fight begins.

551
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
And these fools. they slicin'
and cuttin' at each other.

552
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.973
Because these little
blades only an inch thick.

553
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.563
you can't really deliver the fatal blow.

554
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.010
So these guys. hell.
they're losin' so much blood

555
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.543
'til eventually one of
'em hits the ground.

556
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.043
And the thing is it's the
collapse that's the real killer.

557
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.930
'Cause even if you deliver
the death blow first.

558
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.600
oh hell. that man's
bringin' you down with him.

559
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.767
(soft haunting music)

560
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:32.320
- I seen it.

561
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.280
- Well that's why a man of law

562
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.393
and a man of order.

563
00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:42.083
(sighs) We're better than that.

564
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.440
We're not animals.

565
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.603
We're not supposed to just
cut each other to pieces.

566
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.963
But that's what these men do.

567
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.463
Look.

568
00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:00.270
go see if we can drag that man
back in here. clean him up.

569
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.323
find out who he actually might be.

570
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.953
- Mr. Jennings.

571
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.923
the man is gone.

572
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.263
- Hmm.

573
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:21.113
Well on a night like tonight.
that just don't surprise me.

574
00:42:24.016 --> 00:42:27.183
(dark haunting music)

575
00:43:19.009 --> 00:43:22.176
(dark reverent music)

576
00:43:59.944 --> 00:44:00.777
= it's mighty kind of you

577
00:44:00.777 --> 00:44:03.445
letting my wife and I
hide here. Mr. Jennings.

578
00:44:03.445 --> 00:44:05.003
That Jacob Fulford is crazy.

579
00:44:07.064 --> 00:44:12.064
(soft haunting music)
(boots clacking)

580
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.253
- You know you're the last
of Karankawa. don't you?

581
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.883
I know what you come for.

582
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.200
but I ain't ready to give it to you yet.

583
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:49.840
So you're just gonna
have to head back outside

584
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.723
and wait for that storm to come in.

585
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.910
then you'll know when.

586
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.477
(soft haunting music)

587
00:45:18.487 --> 00:45:21.820
(dark mysterious music)

588
00:45:27.299 --> 00:45:29.966
(glasses clank)

589
00:45:44.896 --> 00:45:48.063
(soft haunting music)

590
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.477
- Who were you talkin' to?

591
00:46:09.494 --> 00:46:10.327
- Myself.

592
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.483
I talk to myself a lot.

593
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.853
They all comfortable down there?

594
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.850
- They alive down there.

595
00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:22.673
I don't think I'd be sayin'
that if they stayed in town.

596
00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.343
- You told 'em to hush down there?

597
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.070
- Mr. Jennings. ELisha
about to have a baby.

598
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.560
I don't think she gonna be able to hush.

599
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.730
- Well then I'm gonna have to go

600
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:40.483
with what my gut's been tellin'
me for the past few hours.

601
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:46.580
I think the first life
to come out of Redemption

602
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.833
ain't gonna be quiet about it.

603
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.933
Well we take that as a good omen.

604
00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.893
The way that room echoes.

605
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:03.260
any screams be comin' from
that place. (chuckles)

606
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.133
Hell.

607
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:09.193
Well they gonna pierce the
night like the devil himself.

608
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:11.893
Can you tell time?

609
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.360
- Not proper.

610
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.351
I get the hands the wrong way.

611
00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:18.184
- See.

612
00:47:19.334 --> 00:47:21.084
I got a pocket watch.

613
00:47:22.885 --> 00:47:23.718
I mean I earned it.

614
00:47:23.718 --> 00:47:28.030
but it was payment for a job

615
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.303
and it sits here you know.
pretty close to my heart. right?

616
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.883
I can't wind it and I can't read it.

617
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:40.450
See. I never had the time to

618
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.280
sit down with the damn thing and

619
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:47.603
work a few things out.

620
00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.700
- If you can't tell the time.

621
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.640
then how do you know
when the hangings are?

622
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.493
- I don't.

623
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:59.430
I just know you walk from Redemption

624
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.980
into Helena at sunrise

625
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.113
and you on time.

626
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.700
Look. Rosanna.

627
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.880
I'm in the sad business of keepin' law

628
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.883
and that means killin' people.

629
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.553
I don't much like doin' it.

630
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.363
It makes me feel like a-

631
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.303
- Like a judge?

632
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.763
- Yeah.

633
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.963
like a judge.

634
00:48:28.416 --> 00:48:30.450
You know how old you are?

635
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.390
- Well I know I'm not
a little girl anymore

636
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.030
and they've been callin' you a judge

637
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.193
since however long ago that was.

638
00:48:39.457 --> 00:48:43.157
- "The Judge of Harbor County."

639
00:48:44.472 --> 00:48:49.472
(chuckles) That's what the
damn newspapers do for ya.

640
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.473
Hell. periodicals. magazines.

641
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.390
- Well Leyland reads out that story to me

642
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.633
whenever he needs to try and
explain why he works with you.

643
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.993
But the Judge ain't all
they call you. Mr. Jennings.

644
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.943
They call you the devil of Helena.

645
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.210
- In a God-fearing world.

646
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.043
I am.

647
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.573
- You ain't no devil. Mr. Jennings.

648
00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.003
- You see that's what the
real devil don't like.

649
00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.040
I'm on the side of God

650
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.553
because he is on the side of order.

651
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.853
- You have a wife before?

652
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.853
- Before when?

653
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.700
- Before you came to Helena.

654
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.783
- Well maybe that's the paradox.

655
00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.600
- What?

656
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.290
You say some strange words. Mr. Jennings.

657
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:51.120
for someone who can't read
and who can't tell time.

658
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.293
What does that mean?

659
00:49:53.529 --> 00:49:55.649
- I've been telling
you too much all night.

660
00:49:55.649 --> 00:49:57.566
but you're curious.

661
00:49:57.566 --> 00:49:59.135
I can see that.

662
00:49:59.135 --> 00:50:01.620
- I been curious all my life.

663
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.173
It's just nobody ain't
ever told me anythin'.

664
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.590
- Well look. you wanna
learn about the world?

665
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.323
Well you gotta get on a steam
ship and cross the ocean.

666
00:50:13.214 --> 00:50:14.214
- That what you did?

667
00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.533
- I seen the other side.

668
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.433
but that's why I came back.

669
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.340
- You came back and
started hangin' people.

670
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:30.320
- No. I came back and I started
educating people up East.

671
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.040
Lotta people ask me to
start preachin' instead.

672
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.040
but I said I never want to
proclaim the words of that book.

673
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.390
It's a story that God
don't ask you to read.

674
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.743
so why make others listen?

675
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.220
- So you weren't a preacher?

676
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.573
The stories say you turned your
back on God a long time ago.

677
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.733
- I turned my back on
preachin' to the converted.

678
00:50:56.733 --> 00:50:59.123
Churchgoer don't think for himself.

679
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.420
He thinks what the
preachers just told him.

680
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.090
His neighbour agrees with him

681
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:08.020
because the preacher told him
the same thing a week ago.

682
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.820
- Don't explain why you kill people.

683
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.210
- Look. I came back to
Goliad expectin' my family.

684
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.613
my wife to still be around.

685
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:22.080
I didn't know. but I'd
been gone for 10 years.

686
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.893
You see the night before I left.

687
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:29.080
this old Indian comes
down from the forest.

688
00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.483
He stands at my door. he
looks at me with an arrow.

689
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.243
Points at the babe wrapped up in the cot.

690
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:38.603
Indian

691
00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.750
cuts me.

692
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:42.943
then he takes the babe
away into the night.

693
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.043
I saw the Indian in my dream.

694
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.800
The Indian said he'd

695
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:51.630
taken my baby to

696
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:55.070
ensure good passage for the journey

697
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.530
that I was about to undertake.

698
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.463
When I came back to Goliad
all those years later.

699
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.840
my cousin had taken my wife as his own.

700
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.493
She dragged up the past.

701
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.430
said it was me sacrificin' our baby

702
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.273
that justified her adultery.

703
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.623
10 years away and what do
you think they try and do?

704
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.940
Kill me in the bath.

705
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.343
- Are you tryin' to scare
me up. Mr. Jennings?

706
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.810
Bad enough we waitin' here to be shot up.

707
00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:34.470
you sit there tellin' me your tragedy?

708
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.450
- Rosanna. have you
ever seen a photograph?

709
00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:40.290
- I've seen some from time to time.

710
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.100
- Would you like to see a photograph?

711
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.250
- Well who's it gonna be a picture of?

712
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.083
- Me.

713
00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.270
- Is it a nice picture?

714
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.103
- No.

715
00:52:50.337 --> 00:52:52.253
It's a death pose.

716
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.907
You still wanna see?

717
00:52:55.907 --> 00:52:59.240
(soft foreboding music)

718
00:53:06.408 --> 00:53:08.158
- Is that really you?

719
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:10.840
I ain't no doctor.

720
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:15.030
but you got an axe in your head

721
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.580
and an axe in your head
usually means you a dead man.

722
00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.553
In that picture. you look dead.

723
00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:25.093
You have succeeded in
scarin' me. Mr. Jennings.

724
00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.493
- No commotion. Dr. Roth.

725
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.300
You have a look at the picture for us.

726
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:39.310
- I know you've showed
me before 100 times.

727
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.660
It's you. James.

728
00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.943
It's the same face I'm looking at now.

729
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.413
What's this about?

730
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.410
You playin' tricks on Rosanna?

731
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.860
- I'm just telling Rosanna the truth.

732
00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.610
You know. the truth about
me being dead in that bath.

733
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:01.020
- How are you still alive. old man?

734
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:05.090
- Look. I need to be back
downstairs with Elisha.

735
00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:05.923
But Rosanna.

736
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.740
you need to believe what's
right for you with Mr. Jennings.

737
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.533
You can't explain it quickly.

738
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.573
- The Indian

739
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.913
came to me in my head.

740
00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.383
showed me the path to follow.

741
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.723
Next time I opened my eyes.

742
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:29.513
I woke up in this place.

743
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:34.583
I didn't know how I got here
or what I was supposed to do.

744
00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.930
Except in my hand. I had a newspaper.

745
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.450
And in it. it had a story about a man

746
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:43.170
who was murdered by his wife

747
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:47.240
with a little line drawing
of that death pose.

748
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.860
- How'd you get better?

749
00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:49.693
- Rosanna.

750
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.173
I didn't get better.

751
00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.020
- Well your wife and cousin

752
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.803
don't sound like the sorta
people I'd like to mix with.

753
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.993
- Life weaves us a circle.

754
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:10.610
That day the Indian left you at my door

755
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.373
with the axe on your
chest. do you remember?

756
00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:17.563
In my mind. it's clear as day.

757
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.703
I never thought I'd be so
happy to see something broken.

758
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.580
- Anyone would think
this was a sewin' circle

759
00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.620
the yarn you spinnin'.

760
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:33.140
- Do you not know the outcome
of this yarn thing. Rosanna?

761
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.623
- It's a story about an axe.

762
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.433
- Well?

763
00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.130
- There ain't no explanation.

764
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:43.900
It's just a dead man
look like Mr. Jennings.

765
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.963
- No. that was Mr. Jennings.

766
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.763
Show her your charm. James.

767
00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:52.440
- I thought we was gonna
be gettin' shot at.

768
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.920
What're you showin' me?

769
00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.520
- [James] Sacred piece of metal.

770
00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.570
- There's life in this metal.

771
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:01.910
- You see that?

772
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:05.300
That's a perfect fracture curve.

773
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.180
You know when metal's been badly forged

774
00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.673
and it gets too cold and
cracks under pressure.

775
00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.760
Well the old axe that me and my father

776
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.760
had used for many years was
just that. badly forged.

777
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.020
It was just waiting for the right hit

778
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.013
to crack the metal clean through.

779
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.800
I knew that. my father knew that.

780
00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.423
so we respected the flaw.

781
00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.980
Thieves who stole that axe.

782
00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.813
well

783
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.293
they didn't know that.

784
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.833
They used the axe for murder.

785
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:47.670
In their barbaric excitement.

786
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.940
they hit the poor school teacher so hard

787
00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.680
that they snapped the metal

788
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.313
and lost it inside her
flesh without realising.

789
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.213
She was dead in a single blow.

790
00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:03.500
Now James here was in the
bath. but it was dark.

791
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.370
And they struck his head with such force

792
00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:08.383
that the axe clamped around his head.

793
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.250
Blood seeped out

794
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:12.993
and they couldn't even
pull the weapon free.

795
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:20.653
To their eyes. James here was
dead with an axe in his head.

796
00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.400
The deed was done and the
murderers escaped into darkness.

797
00:57:28.947 --> 00:57:32.114
(soft haunting music)

798
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:37.740
- Well I reckon dawn's
just about to break.

799
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.777
so you best keep your wits about you.

800
00:57:40.777 --> 00:57:44.695
- [Elisha] Oh doctor! (groans)

801
00:57:44.695 --> 00:57:48.028
(soft foreboding music)

802
00:57:52.833 --> 00:57:55.500
(weeps) Doctor.

803
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.791
- Mr. Jennings.

804
00:58:00.791 --> 00:58:04.124
(soft foreboding music)

805
00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.593
- God's called me. Rosanna.

806
00:58:15.446 --> 00:58:18.696
- I don't know what you're
sayin'. Mr. Jennings.

807
00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:22.029
(soft foreboding music)

808
00:58:24.388 --> 00:58:25.620
(Elisha groaning)

809
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.283
- Go downstairs and help with Elisha.

810
00:58:28.283 --> 00:58:29.970
- But I-

811
00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:31.513
- I told you. Rosanna.

812
00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.153
God has called me.

813
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:42.993
I know what you come for. my friend.

814
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:46.193
But this time.

815
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.653
you can't take my baby.

816
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.800
So you're gonna have to take me instead.

817
00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:58.593
I mean this is precious metal.

818
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:03.163
I understand what happens
when I give this up.

819
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:06.153
I know what's comin' to me.

820
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.367
So it's yours now. my friend.

821
00:59:11.503 --> 00:59:14.670
(dark haunting music)

822
01:00:09.844 --> 01:00:11.011
Jacob Fulford?

823
01:00:12.695 --> 01:00:13.862
Jacob Fulford.

824
01:00:15.747 --> 01:00:17.083
I'm gonna make you famous.

825
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.433
Are you a coward?

826
01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.880
I said

827
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.152
are you

828
01:00:40.152 --> 01:00:41.001
a coward?

829
01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:45.647
(dark haunting music)
(Elisha whimpering)

830
01:00:45.647 --> 01:00:49.230
(Elisha breathing heavily)

831
01:00:51.082 --> 01:00:53.141
(gun blasting)

832
01:00:53.141 --> 01:00:58.141
(dark haunting music)
(shoes clacking)

833
01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:59.610
- [Rosanna] Can you hear me?

834
01:01:01.999 --> 01:01:06.999
(Elisha breathing heavily)
(baby weeping)

835
01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.818
(gun blasting)

836
01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:26.010
- [Jacob] Nobody is going to call me

837
01:01:26.873 --> 01:01:27.706
a coward.

838
01:01:30.601 --> 01:01:31.768
Nobody is here

839
01:01:33.092 --> 01:01:35.289
but the two of us.

840
01:01:35.289 --> 01:01:36.122
- Oh no.

841
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.823
I reckon there's at least four people.

842
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.810
Who are witness to the fact that

843
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.970
you are just a coward

844
01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:54.181
and a coldblooded murderer. Jacob Fulford.

845
01:01:54.181 --> 01:01:55.210
- [Jacob] You are not dead yet.

846
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.560
- [James] I'll give myself a minute.

847
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:03.276
Shame you didn't shoot my watch.

848
01:02:03.276 --> 01:02:05.970
That maybe coulda saved my life.

849
01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:09.450
I think it started tickin'. (chuckles)

850
01:02:10.649 --> 01:02:14.066
- [Jacob] Mortals said you could not die.

851
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.583
but I have injured you with their weapons.

852
01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.733
- You didn't just shoot me. Jacob Fulford.

853
01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:29.940
I just opened the door. (chuckles)

854
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.410
(watch ticking)

855
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.323
When that watch stops.

856
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:38.593
I'll be dead.

857
01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:41.323
Now if you keep that watch.

858
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:45.013
just remember one thing:

859
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.193
that watch.

860
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.643
it don't tell time.

861
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.733
It tells you how long you got left.

862
01:02:57.646 --> 01:03:02.646
(soft haunting music)
(watch ticking)

863
01:03:02.827 --> 01:03:06.050
Well you just remember. Mr. Fulford.

864
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.123
Redemption.

865
01:03:10.303 --> 01:03:14.079
Redemption is a magnet for souls like you.

866
01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:19.079
(soft haunting music)
(watch ticking)

867
01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:31.909
(James wincing)

868
01:03:41.078 --> 01:03:44.245
(soft haunting music)

869
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.003
- Leave. Fulford.

870
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.553
- [Jacob] Your precious judge is gone.

871
01:03:56.293 --> 01:03:59.126
Have I not done enough to come in?

872
01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.710
- No.

873
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.460
Cowardly act like that doesn't
deserve anything at all.

874
01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:10.650
We don't want you.

875
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:11.553
You can leave.

876
01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:17.188
- [Jacob] I have his watch.

877
01:04:18.853 --> 01:04:20.603
I have his power now.

878
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:22.893
do I not?

879
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.103
- You're a cursed man now. Jacob.

880
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:33.093
Leave.

881
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.323
We have our own business to settle.

882
01:04:39.137 --> 01:04:44.137
(soft haunting music)
(watch ticking)

883
01:05:01.077 --> 01:05:04.963
- "Why won't you just let me die in peace?

884
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:10.320
I wouldn't have lasted
the night in that cold.

885
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.940
but you bring me here with your vengeance

886
01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:16.060
and your talk of redemption.

887
01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.727
Hell. I am redeemed."

888
01:05:19.026 --> 01:05:22.193
(soft haunting music)

889
01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.533
Redemption is a magnet for souls like you.

890
01:05:44.123 --> 01:05:47.202
You the devil tauntin' me
on a strange night. girl?

891
01:05:47.202 --> 01:05:48.682
- You gotta help.

892
01:05:48.682 --> 01:05:51.849
(soft haunting music)

893
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.920
Is he comin' back?

894
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.163
- Find out tomorrow.

895
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.310
- What does that mean. Dr. Roth?

896
01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:15.310
- Think about what he told you. Rosanna.

897
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.883
- Well Mr. Jennings
tells me a lotta things.

898
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.533
- He told you everything
you need to know about him.

899
01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.258
You don't know much about the
law in these parts. do you?

900
01:06:32.258 --> 01:06:35.425
(dark haunting music)

901
01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:02.220
- [James] In spring 1862.

902
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:05.440
the remains of a small rural homestead

903
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.600
were found by US marshals

904
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.463
searching for their
brother-in-arms. James Jennings.

905
01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.630
In the near-frozen location.

906
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:18.660
personal effects were
found abandoned in the snow

907
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.463
and a crude rope marked the boundary.

908
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:26.070
Months earlier. the sounds
of an intense battle

909
01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:29.167
were reported by the townsfolk of Helena.

910
01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:31.348
- [Marshal] Charge 'er up. W.

911
01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:32.756
- [Marshal] Judge. you gonna get it now.

912
01:07:32.756 --> 01:07:35.160
(explosion bursting)

913
01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.570
- [James] Explosions and
the screams of a posse

914
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.533
of Confederate army deserters.

915
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.833
No evidence of any such
battle could be found.

916
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.550
The marshals had been led to the location

917
01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:54.900
by a respected Goliad doctor.

918
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.500
Make sure Dr. Roth knows what's goin' on.

919
01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.930
The young family also present

920
01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:02.800
insisted a girl had come from the woods

921
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.940
to guide them to the property

922
01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.940
and help them seek refuge in a
hidden underground ice house.

923
01:08:09.983 --> 01:08:13.150
(soft haunting music)

924
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.210
In their report to superiors.

925
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:21.800
the marshals noted that
despite an extensive search

926
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.173
no additional rooms were uncovered.

927
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.130
The body of James Jennings

928
01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:32.390
also known as the Judge was never found

929
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.830
and the testimony of the group

930
01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:39.140
reduced to that of drunken hysteria

931
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.810
on a macabre night of celebration

932
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.631
all Hallows' Eve.

933
01:08:45.631 --> 01:08:48.964
(soft foreboding music)

934
01:08:50.345 --> 01:08:52.293
- [Marshal] Charge 'er up. W.

935
01:08:52.293 --> 01:08:53.676
- [Marshal] Judge. you gonna get it now.

936
01:08:53.676 --> 01:08:55.192
(explosion bursting)

937
01:08:55.192 --> 01:08:59.491
- [Marshal] Give Jennings a warning shot.

938
01:08:59.491 --> 01:09:02.658
(soft haunting music)

939
01:09:04.325 --> 01:09:05.983
(baby cries)

940
01:09:05.983 --> 01:09:10.983
(eerie mystical music)
(music box winding)

941
01:09:34.653 --> 01:09:36.320
- [James] One night.

942
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:38.203
I had a dream.

943
01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:42.960
the problem I got right now

944
01:09:45.245 --> 01:09:46.350
is some days

945
01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:50.230
I couldn't tell you if I
ever woke up from that dream.

946
01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:55.556
(dark haunting music)

947
01:11:38.632 --> 01:11:41.215
(wind howling)
