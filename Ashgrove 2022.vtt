3
00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:16.797
And we're back.

4
00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.364
We're talking to professor
of water chemistry.

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.105
Dr. Jennifer Ashgrove.

6
00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.237
one of the many scientists
around the world

7
00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.501
trying to find a solution
to the water pandemic.

8
00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:29.070
Dr. Ashgrove. we know it's too
late now to create a vaccine

9
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.247
now that the entire world
is infected with this virus.

10
00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:33.640
But can you explain to me

11
00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:36.817
what exactly are you and
your team working on?

12
00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:40.821
As we all know.

13
00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.301
this virus feeds on oxygen molecules

14
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.302
in the water that we drink.

15
00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:44.738
making water consumption toxic

16
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.697
and unfortunately. eventually fatal.

17
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.483
So essentially. my team
and I are looking for ways

18
00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.485
to bond the oxygen
molecules more securely

19
00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:54.835
to the hydrogen molecules
in the water we drink

20
00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:58.970
so the virus will starve and
eventually. hopefully die.

21
00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:01.755
You know. this time in history

22
00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:03.931
has been nicknamed the great paradox.

23
00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:06.151
We obviously need water to survive.

24
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.718
but now if we drink too
little. we'd dehydrate.

25
00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:11.069
We drink too much and the
toxicity builds up in us

26
00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:12.461
and it can kill us.

27
00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:13.419
Well. it really comes down to

28
00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.637
self-regulation here.

29
00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.161
The death rates are astounding.

30
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.032
but they would slow
down if people carefully

31
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.729
rationed their water intake.

32
00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:23.821
But you know.
obviously relying on individuals

33
00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:25.779
to change their
behaviors. often enough.

34
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.737
I mean. the numbers. as you
mentioned are astounding.

35
00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:31.089
That's 60 million people
around the world have died

36
00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:33.352
and the rest of the
population is now expected

37
00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:35.658
to perish within five years.

38
00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.139
Well. I know a lot of people are looking

39
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.620
to you specifically to
help get us out of this.

40
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.753
I saw that the UK Science
Journal reported last week.

41
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:46.756
that of all the teams around the world.

42
00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:48.846
you might be the closest
to a breakthrough.

43
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.195
That is flattering

44
00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:52.545
but I can't really comment on that now

45
00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:54.329
but I can promise you

46
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.549
that I haven't taken a single
day away from this work

47
00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.856
since the outbreak started and won't.

48
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.467
I know that you're married.

49
00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.164
And I imagine working a job like this

50
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:06.951
that has such a demand
on you every single day.

51
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:08.430
what kind of toll does that take?

52
00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:13.392
- Uh. yes. well. it's
all about balance

53
00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:14.436
and I think...

54
00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:19.093
In this situation. you make it work.

55
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.878
You just. you find a way.

56
00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:23.489
We're doing okay.

57
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.992
Oh my God.

58
00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:49.341
- Jenn?

59
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.171
- I gotta go.

60
00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:06.619
Fuck. Frank. pick up.

61
00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:09.665
This is Frank. leave a message.

62
00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:10.405
- Frank!

63
00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:13.626
Frank. Frank. I figured it out.

64
00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:16.759
Get the team together

65
00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:19.110
and meet me at the office in 45 minutes.

66
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.982
I figured it out. Frank. I-

67
00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:26.378
Fuck. I figured it out.

68
00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:54.449
- Hey.

69
00:03:56.582 --> 00:03:57.757
- Hi.

70
00:03:57.844 --> 00:03:58.976
How you doing?

71
00:03:59.063 --> 00:03:59.802
- Hmm.

72
00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.632
A little groggy.
- Yeah.

73
00:04:05.634 --> 00:04:06.722
- Oh. I'm sorry.

74
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.681
No. don't be sorry.

75
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:10.988
- I know. I slept a long time.

76
00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:15.122
- Hi. I'm Dr. Lakeland.

77
00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:19.648
Yeah. so you feeling okay. Jennifer?

78
00:04:23.478 --> 00:04:24.392
- Yes.
- Okay.

79
00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.916
- So.
- Sorry. this is-

80
00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:28.309
- I know. I know. I'm so sorry

81
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.702
to sort of surprise you
like that. I'm sorry.

82
00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.530
- Hmm hmm.
- I'm sorry.

83
00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:33.140
But I just wanted to make
sure that I could talk to you

84
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:34.402
when you woke up.

85
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.882
We've determined that you're suffering

86
00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.015
from a bit of a dissociative amnesia.

87
00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:40.669
which just means things. you know.

88
00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:42.584
before you collapse might
be a little bit fuzzy.

89
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.629
That's okay.

90
00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.109
And that's normal. guys.

91
00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:45.761
So I don't want you to worry about that.

92
00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:46.806
- Okay-
- Some things.

93
00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:48.286
It's no problem.

94
00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:49.765
When you collapsed.

95
00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:51.550
do you know how much water
you'd consume that day?

96
00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:56.338
- It was. uh.
directly after lunch.

97
00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:58.601
So. 25.

98
00:04:58.688 --> 00:05:00.038
- Okay. great.

99
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.257
So we can rule out any toxicity.

100
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.607
Jennifer. I understand you
have a bit of a history

101
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.740
of having these like
stress-induced blackouts.

102
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.437
Is that correct?

103
00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:09.221
- Umm.

104
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:12.572
Well. no. I don't think.

105
00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:16.097
a bit of a history. is a correct way to.

106
00:05:16.184 --> 00:05:18.708
Well. I've had. there's
been several times

107
00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:21.885
that I've lost time for a moment.

108
00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:24.279
but it's.

109
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.021
it doesn't happen every
day is what I'm saying.

110
00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:29.676
- Okay and have you ever
been hospitalized with those?

111
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.112
- No. no. no.

112
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:39.773
I have. I was in the hospital
last year for four days.

113
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:44.256
We had a miscarriage and so I.

114
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.868
it has nothing to do with the blackouts.

115
00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:48.738
This was more...

116
00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:53.308
Personal.
- Okay.

117
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.006
Well. since you have

118
00:05:56.094 --> 00:05:58.531
what I would consider a medical history

119
00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:00.010
with these blackouts

120
00:06:00.098 --> 00:06:04.058
and because I know that
you're under very extreme.

121
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.713
like unimaginable stress right now.

122
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.497
I think that what's going
to be really great for you

123
00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:10.804
is if you take a
little bit of time off.

124
00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:13.546
if you have a little bit of a
rest. just a couple of days.

125
00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:14.982
I think that's going to be great for you

126
00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.679
and ultimately. great for everybody else.

127
00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:21.249
- You understand what
I do for a living?

128
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.946
Correct?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:25.601
- Well. then you realize
that it's not possible for me

130
00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:26.907
to take any sort of break.

131
00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:29.605
I feel great right now.

132
00:06:29.736 --> 00:06:31.172
- Well. so. okay.

133
00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:32.434
So here's the thing.

134
00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:34.132
Because of the stress you're under

135
00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.307
and because you do have this history.

136
00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:38.397
my concern would be that
these blackouts reoccur.

137
00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:39.876
So I think what's going
to be great for you

138
00:06:40.007 --> 00:06:43.010
and it's going to ultimately
help you do your job.

139
00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:44.925
is if we can reset your system a bit.

140
00:06:45.055 --> 00:06:46.231
I'm just talking about a weekend.

141
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:47.623
You know-
- Okay.

142
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.885
- I'm not saying
take a month off.

143
00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:50.017
Just like a couple of days.
- Okay.

144
00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:51.453
- Is there somewhere
maybe you could go

145
00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:53.803
where you could just relax.
get away from everything?

146
00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.067
- Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:59.722
We have a farm. her family farm.

148
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.725
- Yeah.

149
00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:03.509
- That sounds great.

150
00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.693
- You're not
supposed to be here.

151
00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:16.348
- Good morning. Frank.

152
00:07:17.392 --> 00:07:18.828
Just saving the world.

153
00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:19.873
I'll be out in 15 minutes.

154
00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:21.179
- Goddammit. Jennifer.

155
00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:21.831
- Don't goddammit. me.

156
00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:23.006
I'm not even here.

157
00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:24.660
- We have had this conversation.

158
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:26.184
- Look away.

159
00:07:26.314 --> 00:07:27.446
- You just had a blackout.
- Why are following me?

160
00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:30.013
- You had a blackout
a month ago.

161
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.363
I can't use you like this.

162
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.756
Doctor's orders. you need to rest.

163
00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:35.454
- I'm not resting.

164
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:36.977
I'm going to head upstairs to my office.

165
00:07:37.064 --> 00:07:38.631
You will barely notice me.

166
00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:40.633
And then. we can get back to work.

167
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.243
- Why don't you go to that
place you got in the country

168
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.462
with your husband?

169
00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:44.941
- Sure.

170
00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:46.552
Every day. a hundred thousand people die

171
00:07:46.682 --> 00:07:48.641
but I'm going to go. head
up and have a vacation.

172
00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:52.166
- Green team is still working
on your new toxicity formula.

173
00:07:52.297 --> 00:07:55.778
Geneva needs two days to send
them the bacteria results.

174
00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:56.866
You've got the time.

175
00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:00.130
- Who's going to run
point man when I'm gone?

176
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:01.871
For two days. who's going to take over?

177
00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:06.093
- This isn't a request.

178
00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:08.965
If you're still here in 10
minutes. I'm calling the MPs.

179
00:08:09.052 --> 00:08:10.271
have you sent home.

180
00:08:10.402 --> 00:08:11.229
- You gotta be
kidding me. Frank.

181
00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:11.925
- Nine minutes. 58 seconds.

182
00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:13.056
- Frank!

183
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:14.884
Frank!

184
00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:17.409
Sorry.

185
00:08:19.193 --> 00:08:20.281
- Who is gonna run point man?

186
00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:22.936
- Did I say point man?

187
00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.024
I meant point woman.

188
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:25.112
- That makes it better?

189
00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:27.157
- Well point person.
- All right.

190
00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:29.334
- Point people. if we could
have multiple people running.

191
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:31.945
Quit while
you're ahead. man. Jesus.

192
00:08:32.075 --> 00:08:33.120
- Okay. fill me in.

193
00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:35.775
- Bacteria patterning.

194
00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:37.516
You know what Snowmax is?

195
00:08:37.603 --> 00:08:40.170
It's the fake snow on ski hills.

196
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:42.869
It's made using the bacteria.
pseudomonas syringae.

197
00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:44.218
- Yeah.

198
00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:45.567
- Bacteria is amazing
ice nuclear. right?

199
00:08:45.698 --> 00:08:46.351
You know that.

200
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:47.917
So you take bacteria.

201
00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:49.136
And when it's in ice form.

202
00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:52.095
the molecules are more
firmly bound together

203
00:08:52.182 --> 00:08:54.141
so the virus would have a
hard time ripping it apart.

204
00:08:54.228 --> 00:08:56.143
So what we need to do is
come up with a pre-ice.

205
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.579
- And it could still
possibly be digested?

206
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.886
- I don't know. find out.

207
00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.061
I'll do some modeling over the weekend

208
00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:04.151
while you go away to the farm

209
00:09:04.238 --> 00:09:05.848
and then we can deal with it-
- Elliot.

210
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.243
Enough.

211
00:09:09.374 --> 00:09:12.159
What is your obsession
with a farm. you people.

212
00:09:12.246 --> 00:09:14.117
- It's not an obsession
with the farm. Jennifer.

213
00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:15.771
You need some time to relax.

214
00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:17.947
You need some time to just
get away from this. okay?

215
00:09:18.034 --> 00:09:19.819
I promise you. if you
go away for the weekend.

216
00:09:19.906 --> 00:09:21.473
I'll do this work.

217
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.126
We'll revisit it Monday morning

218
00:09:23.213 --> 00:09:24.432
and I'll have some answers for you.

219
00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.348
Look. you're stuck.

220
00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:29.350
You need to stop thinking
about it for a couple of days.

221
00:09:29.437 --> 00:09:31.483
And I don't know. maybe the
solution will come to you.

222
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.310
- Fine.

223
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.360
But if I'm going to the
farm. you're coming with me.

224
00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:40.622
- I'm not going to the farm.

225
00:09:40.753 --> 00:09:41.536
I'm gonna stay here.
- Yes. you are.

226
00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.755
Just listen to me. please.

227
00:09:42.885 --> 00:09:43.669
You and Sam can

228
00:09:45.758 --> 00:09:47.281
come up for dinner.

229
00:09:47.368 --> 00:09:49.065
I can't do this alone.

230
00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:50.719
And I can't sit up there
at that farm without you.

231
00:09:50.806 --> 00:09:51.633
- Yup.

232
00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:52.808
We'll go.
- Yeah?

233
00:09:52.939 --> 00:09:53.896
- Hmm hmm.

234
00:09:53.983 --> 00:09:55.985
- And we will relax.

235
00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:58.336
And Jason will make

236
00:09:59.772 --> 00:10:01.426
a Colombian dish.

237
00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:04.211
Colombian?

238
00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:06.256
- Yep. he's going to make
a delicious Colombian-

239
00:10:06.387 --> 00:10:08.215
- Oh. goddamnit. that's good.

240
00:10:08.302 --> 00:10:11.000
Yes. get him to make a
Colombian meal for me and-

241
00:10:11.087 --> 00:10:12.306
- It's going to be wonderful.

242
00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:13.438
And you're going to regret saying that.

243
00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:15.135
And it's going to be a wonderful weekend.

244
00:10:15.265 --> 00:10:17.398
- Hmm hmm. what are you
going to do up there.

245
00:10:17.485 --> 00:10:18.965
over the weekend?

246
00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:20.445
- I don't know.

247
00:10:20.532 --> 00:10:22.316
I'm going to do whatever I
need to do to let you guys know

248
00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:25.014
that I am okay and to get you off my back.

249
00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:27.147
I will be relaxed.

250
00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:28.061
I'm going to have fun

251
00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:29.889
at the farm.

252
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.303
It's nice there.

253
00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:31.304
- Um. I moved all your
stuff into the drawers.

254
00:14:31.434 --> 00:14:32.914
the two top drawers.

255
00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:35.438
But I see that you've
moved everything around

256
00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:36.396
that used to be there.

257
00:14:36.483 --> 00:14:38.485
Yeah.

258
00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:41.967
- Thank you.

259
00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:43.795
For?

260
00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:47.407
- You've done a lot of
work around the house

261
00:14:47.494 --> 00:14:49.322
and have taken care of it.

262
00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:51.498
- You're welcome.
- It's good.

263
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:53.588
You've done a lot.

264
00:14:53.719 --> 00:14:56.156
- Yeah. no. it's
keeping me busy.

265
00:14:56.243 --> 00:14:57.723
It's good.

266
00:14:57.853 --> 00:14:59.550
Yeah. I mean. you know.

267
00:14:59.638 --> 00:15:03.990
if you want anything moved
back. just let me know.

268
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.514
- No. I don't want
anything moved back.

269
00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:11.824
Um. also you play the ukulele.

270
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:16.393
- Very observant.

271
00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:19.266
When did you?

272
00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:22.356
Why and when?

273
00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:24.010
- Uh.
- But mostly why.

274
00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:30.364
- Uh. I did it in. I
picked it up last March.

275
00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:33.236
And I just been working on it.

276
00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:35.499
I don't know. it's been
a good thing for me.

277
00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:38.415
It keeps me company on
those lonely nights.

278
00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:41.331
- Nice.

279
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.163
Listen. I.

280
00:15:49.513 --> 00:15:52.560
I don't want to do this.

281
00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:53.909
this weekend.

282
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.910
of just.

283
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:57.913
just a little.

284
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.742
it keeps me company digs and I don't.

285
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:02.875
I just. I don't want to
do that this weekend.

286
00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:06.443
- Why are you pissed
off at me right now?

287
00:16:06.574 --> 00:16:09.403
- It's just. Jason. I love
the fact that you learned

288
00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:12.623
a completely. random instrument

289
00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:14.016
with all of the time that you have off.

290
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.322
It has nothing to do with that.

291
00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:16.627
- So then what are
you pissed off about?

292
00:16:16.758 --> 00:16:19.587
- I just don't need
you to use it as a tool

293
00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:24.374
to remind me of how alone
you feel or are. or I just-

294
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:26.420
Listen. I love it.

295
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.856
I think it's great.

296
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.597
I am glad that you found
something to do with your time

297
00:16:29.684 --> 00:16:31.904
besides moving stuff around the house.

298
00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:36.473
- Let's make lunch.

299
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.257
Let's make lunch.

300
00:16:38.388 --> 00:16:40.216
And I'm fucking thirsty.

301
00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:41.435
I'm ready for a sip. you?

302
00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:43.480
Come.

303
00:16:45.308 --> 00:16:46.614
Let's eat.

304
00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:50.313
Uh. are we
doing doing sandwiches?

305
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.097
- Yeah.

306
00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:54.622
All right.

307
00:16:56.493 --> 00:16:57.756
I'm thinking maybe we could

308
00:16:58.582 --> 00:17:01.324
make some rules.

309
00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:02.369
rules for the weekend.

310
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:03.152
I'll lay down some.

311
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:06.112
I'm going to commit to.

312
00:17:07.853 --> 00:17:09.245
I'm not gonna make.

313
00:17:09.332 --> 00:17:11.160
I'm not going to do any
more passive aggressive

314
00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:15.991
shitty things for your
acknowledgement or attention.

315
00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:17.776
I won't.

316
00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:19.908
That is my promise to you
for the weekend. okay?

317
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:20.779
Well. hopefully. forever.

318
00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:22.432
but definitely for the weekend.

319
00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:25.784
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

320
00:17:25.871 --> 00:17:27.524
Well then. if you're doing that.

321
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:29.483
I am going

322
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.791
to be present.

323
00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:36.403
The whole time. here.

324
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.491
- Yeah?

325
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.623
That'd be great.

326
00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:41.364
- Okay.

327
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.499
- I promise no more
wisecracks about you

328
00:17:46.717 --> 00:17:48.981
being off. saving the planet

329
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:52.332
while I'm stuck at home with my ukulele.

330
00:17:55.248 --> 00:17:56.553
- Is it a ukulele
or is it a banjo?

331
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.816
- You know. it's a ukulele.

332
00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:01.384
- Well then. uh.

333
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:04.474
it looks like it's going
to be a nice weekend.

334
00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:07.913
I'm not going to have a sandwich anymore.

335
00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:08.870
I don't really feel like one.

336
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:10.306
I'm just gonna eat a salad.

337
00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:12.613
- Ah. I think you.
why. are you sure?

338
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.615
- Yeah.

339
00:18:14.702 --> 00:18:15.834
- Let me make you this sandwich.

340
00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:18.749
I really feel like
you're going to like it.

341
00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:21.100
I've been working on my
sandwich-making abilities

342
00:18:21.187 --> 00:18:23.102
and it's going to be
the best turkey sandwich

343
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:23.885
you've ever had.

344
00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:25.234
- I'm sure it is.

345
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:26.845
I just. honestly. I just want a salad.

346
00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:31.197
- All right. look.

347
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.504
This is silly. but.

348
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.942
I baked the bread.

349
00:18:37.072 --> 00:18:38.073
I baked the bread and

350
00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:40.162
when I baked it.

351
00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:40.902
I imagined us.

352
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.688
eating the sandwiches together.

353
00:18:44.775 --> 00:18:48.257
That's stupid and it's weird
and sentimental and dumb.

354
00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:50.825
If you wanna have a salad. I get it.

355
00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:53.480
Have a salad.

356
00:18:56.265 --> 00:18:56.962
- Yes. Fine.

357
00:18:57.092 --> 00:18:58.485
Yes. thank you.

358
00:18:58.572 --> 00:18:59.573
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

359
00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:00.443
I just. I'd love one.

360
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.533
- Okay.

361
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.406
Would you join me in
trading five ounces of water

362
00:19:07.842 --> 00:19:09.409
for a three ounce glass
of wine for lunch?

363
00:19:12.325 --> 00:19:13.065
- Yes.

364
00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:14.675
Yes.

00:19:14.762 --> 00:19:15.763
- Okay.

366
00:19:15.894 --> 00:19:17.069
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

367
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:19.375
- I'm at 25.

368
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.163
- Wanna go and pick a bottle?

369
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.207
- Yeah.

370
00:19:25.338 --> 00:19:25.947
Are you okay?

371
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:29.298
- I'm good.

372
00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:30.082
- Are you okay?

373
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.087
- Yes.

374
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.437
- Okay.

375
00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:41.441

376
00:19:42.746 --> 00:19:43.443
- White.

377
00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:49.797
Fuck me.

378
00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:55.411
- Potatoes. I dug
those up already.

379
00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:57.239
Do you remember the scallop potatoes

380
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.806
I made with the veal chop?
- Yeah.

381
00:19:58.937 --> 00:20:00.503
- Yeah. that was those.

382
00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.810
Asparagus went to seed like. months ago.

383
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:04.768
So that's done.

384
00:20:04.855 --> 00:20:06.118
- You've done a lot of work.

385
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.425
It's really good.
- Thanks.

386
00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:11.645
Yeah. and I'm getting good at it.

387
00:20:11.775 --> 00:20:13.386
Thumb's turning green.

388
00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:14.300
- Let me see?

389
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.996
- I should probably get that.

390
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.737
Looked at.

391
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:18.782
- I'll grab the far end.
- Okay.

392
00:20:18.913 --> 00:20:19.609
You good?

393
00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:22.873
Ready and lift.

394
00:20:26.007 --> 00:20:27.095
- You okay?
- Yep.

395
00:20:33.928 --> 00:20:35.712
You have weight. no. no.

396
00:20:35.843 --> 00:20:37.062
Just paddle on the right.

397
00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:39.586
Paddle on the right.
- Oh. Jesus Christ.

398
00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.153
- You want me to help?

399
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.764
Are you trying to turn
this perpendicular?

400
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:45.244
What are you doing?

401
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.855
You tell me if you see a
rock. so we can avoid it.

402
00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:48.987
- You know what?
- Yep.

403
00:20:49.074 --> 00:20:50.466
- Here's my guess.
- Yeah.

404
00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:51.990
- There's rocks
fucking everywhere.

405
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.602
Are we going forwards or backwards?

406
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:56.864
South.

407
00:20:56.995 --> 00:20:58.692
- Which way is South?

408
00:20:58.822 --> 00:20:59.954
I don't know.

409
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:02.087
So relaxing.

410
00:21:02.217 --> 00:21:03.305
Fuck.

411
00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.785
- How are you doing back there?

412
00:21:04.872 --> 00:21:06.308
- I'm doing great. just amazing.

413
00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:08.180
It's been enlightening.

414
00:21:12.662 --> 00:21:15.796
It's pretty.

415
00:21:15.926 --> 00:21:17.841
- Wish it could tell
me what it's thinking.

416
00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.064
We should do this more often.

417
00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:52.659
Oh.

418
00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:07.021
Oh my God.

419
00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:07.761
- Fuck.

420
00:22:11.156 --> 00:22:12.331
Fuck.

421
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:13.636
- How much did you have left?

422
00:22:15.725 --> 00:22:16.596
- I don't know.

423
00:22:17.727 --> 00:22:18.902
I don't know.

424
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:27.563
Fuck.

425
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.827
What are you doing?

426
00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:32.786
Stop.
- Hey. hey. hey.

427
00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:34.179
I'll follow you.

428
00:22:46.713 --> 00:22:48.106
- I'm sorry.

429
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:54.808
You know. I feel like a bit.

430
00:22:54.938 --> 00:22:55.809
no. a lot of a

431
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.161
shit person.

432
00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:02.816
because I haven't asked you
anything about your book.

433
00:23:04.165 --> 00:23:05.123
Like anything.

434
00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:08.778
The whole year has been about me and.

435
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.304
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:13.783
- No. it's fine.

437
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.176
I don't want to talk about work.

438
00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:16.656
We promised we weren't
going to talk about work.

439
00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.006
- But I wanna know
about your work.

440
00:23:20.355 --> 00:23:22.705
- Yeah. but we made a rule and.

441
00:23:22.836 --> 00:23:25.882
can't break a rule.

442
00:23:26.013 --> 00:23:26.709
- What do you want
to talk about. then?

443
00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:27.275
- I don't.

444
00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:29.712
I'm trying to write something.

445
00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:30.670
What do you think?

446
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.019
- You want to write something?

447
00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.063
- No. I'm trying
to. I've got the.

448
00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:43.073
- Did you write that?

449
00:23:43.204 --> 00:23:43.987
- Yeah.
- No. you didn't.

450
00:23:44.074 --> 00:23:45.467
- It took me three months.

451
00:23:55.782 --> 00:23:56.609
- Is it finished?

452
00:23:56.739 --> 00:23:58.088
- No.

453
00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:00.047
No. I'd like to put words in.

454
00:24:03.398 --> 00:24:07.010
I would never. I tried and I'm shit.

455
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:08.360
So I'll just go silly like.

456
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:09.709
- Just make something up.

457
00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:40.783
I do.

458
00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.106
- Nice!

459
00:25:10.901 --> 00:25:11.859
I think it's a hit.

460
00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:12.729
I think it's amazing.

461
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.253
- Yeah. you got a winner there?

462
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.949
- Hmm hmm.

463
00:26:37.988 --> 00:26:38.728
I hate you!

464
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.036
You betrayed me first!

465
00:26:43.864 --> 00:26:44.821
- What is it?

466
00:26:44.952 --> 00:26:46.562
You okay?

467
00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:47.346
You okay?

468
00:26:48.651 --> 00:26:49.391
What was it?

469
00:26:49.478 --> 00:26:50.349
What was it?

470
00:26:52.176 --> 00:26:53.090
- Uh.
- Do you remember?

471
00:26:58.966 --> 00:27:01.098
- No.
- Okay. okay.

472
00:27:01.185 --> 00:27:02.796
Go back to sleep.

473
00:27:02.883 --> 00:27:04.928
Shh. come on.

474
00:27:05.015 --> 00:27:05.973
- I'm sorry.

475
00:27:06.103 --> 00:27:07.757
- No. it's okay. come.

476
00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:11.195
- I'm okay.

477
00:27:11.326 --> 00:27:12.588
- It's all right. it's okay.

478
00:27:12.675 --> 00:27:13.372
Come here.

479
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:22.598
It's okay. go back to sleep.

480
00:29:00.522 --> 00:29:02.437
Hey. you wanna
go to the farmer's market?

481
00:29:02.568 --> 00:29:04.657
I would love to
go to the farmer's market.

482
00:29:09.923 --> 00:29:12.273
Can I get the yellow beans?

483
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.058
A dozen corn.

484
00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:16.756
Can we get a basket of the mixed peppers?

485
00:29:16.886 --> 00:29:17.496
Sure.

486
00:29:20.542 --> 00:29:22.196

487
00:29:22.326 --> 00:29:23.110
Yeah. sure.

00:29:23.197 --> 00:29:24.807
Hi.

489
00:29:24.894 --> 00:29:25.242
Can we get a
bag of the honey crisp?

490
00:29:25.373 --> 00:29:26.722
You give me the stuff.

491
00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:29.159
You go grab the apple crumbled pie.

492
00:29:29.246 --> 00:29:30.770
I'll meet you back at the car.

493
00:29:30.857 --> 00:29:33.424
As usual. do you
have any apple crumbled pie?

494
00:29:33.512 --> 00:29:35.122
Oh no. I don't have those today.

495
00:29:35.209 --> 00:29:37.864
But we have the apple cake
here. that's very nice.

496
00:29:39.605 --> 00:29:41.520
- So Hans didn't have any
more apple crumble. but.

497
00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:43.826
he gave me strawberry rhubarb.

498
00:29:43.957 --> 00:29:45.393
His last one. he sends his apologies.

499
00:29:45.524 --> 00:29:46.394
- Oh. okay.

500
00:29:49.092 --> 00:29:50.180
Uh.

501
00:29:51.268 --> 00:29:52.313
Are you sure he didn't have any?

502
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.096
- Yeah.

503
00:29:54.402 --> 00:29:55.969
He was very upset for you.

504
00:29:56.056 --> 00:29:56.709
- Uh.

505
00:29:58.624 --> 00:30:01.496
Sometimes. he has some in the back.

506
00:30:01.627 --> 00:30:03.150
- He didn't. he had.
he didn't have any.

507
00:30:03.237 --> 00:30:03.759
- You know what?

508
00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:08.372
Humor me. I'm
gonna double-check.

509
00:30:08.459 --> 00:30:09.417
- You don't have
to double check.

510
00:30:09.504 --> 00:30:10.810
- I'll be one sec.
I'll be one sec.

511
00:30:10.897 --> 00:30:11.550

00:30:18.861 --> 00:30:20.167
Hey...

00:30:33.397 --> 00:30:34.137
Got it.

514
00:30:35.965 --> 00:30:37.053
- How did you get it?
- He always does that.

515
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.011
- He's losing it. man.

516
00:30:38.098 --> 00:30:38.751
He's losing it.

517
00:30:40.753 --> 00:30:42.450
Let's go.
- He checked in the back.

518
00:30:46.106 --> 00:30:46.585
He lied to me.

519
00:32:19.982 --> 00:32:20.679
- It's not easy.

520
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:24.857
I'm trying.

521
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:27.947
Yeah.

522
00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:33.300
You think I don't know that?

523
00:32:35.345 --> 00:32:37.130
Yeah. okay. I will.

524
00:32:39.698 --> 00:32:41.351
Yeah. she's in the hammock.

525
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.224
Alright.

526
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.141
Okay. bye.

527
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.984
Fuck.

528
00:33:23.089 --> 00:33:23.785
Jenn?

529
00:33:25.134 --> 00:33:26.614
- Hey.

530
00:33:29.443 --> 00:33:30.400
- Right here.

531
00:33:30.487 --> 00:33:31.662
Oh.

532
00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:33.316
Hey. what are you. what's going on?

533
00:33:33.403 --> 00:33:36.232
- Oh. I'm just uh.

536
00:33:45.938 --> 00:33:46.765
Uh?

539
00:33:52.292 --> 00:33:54.337
- Yeah. I just wanted to
give them a couple of things

540
00:33:54.424 --> 00:33:55.861
for the baby.

541
00:33:55.991 --> 00:33:59.038
It's like an early surprise baby present.

542
00:33:59.125 --> 00:33:59.734
I thought it'd be nice.

543
00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:00.953
Just at dinner tonight.

544
00:34:02.432 --> 00:34:04.260
- Well-

545
00:34:04.347 --> 00:34:06.349
- I don't wanna give them
any sort of the artificial.

546
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.700
weird sterile crap that
they have in their registry.

547
00:34:09.788 --> 00:34:10.832
I just want to give
them something personal.

548
00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:12.094
I thought it would be nice.

549
00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:14.880
And I think it's just a nice gesture

550
00:34:14.967 --> 00:34:17.360
to give them something
that means something to us.

551
00:34:18.361 --> 00:34:19.449
Well. me.

552
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.363
- No. us.

553
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.800
No. no. us.

554
00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:22.670
It means something to us.

555
00:34:22.801 --> 00:34:24.106
- I know.

556
00:34:24.237 --> 00:34:26.108
And I want Sam and Elliot to have it.

557
00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.371
I think it would be nice for them to have.

558
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:29.938
Like. it's just.

559
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.940
and something's. ah. there it is.

560
00:34:33.724 --> 00:34:34.377
Hmm.

561
00:34:35.857 --> 00:34:38.120
- Babe. I don't. I don't.
- It's nice.

562
00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:40.296
- I don't think we should
give them this stuff.

563
00:34:41.123 --> 00:34:42.733
- Why?

564
00:34:42.821 --> 00:34:45.301
We were saving
Bubba for something.

565
00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:50.567
- Yeah. but he's
currently living in a box.

566
00:34:50.698 --> 00:34:51.831
And I want him to be used.

567
00:34:51.918 --> 00:34:52.701
And so.

568
00:34:54.398 --> 00:34:57.837
let's give him to some
people that would use him.

569
00:34:57.924 --> 00:34:59.664
- I thought we
were going to use.

570
00:35:05.322 --> 00:35:06.193
So are you...

571
00:35:08.238 --> 00:35:09.587
- I don't want to talk.

572
00:35:09.718 --> 00:35:10.458
I don't want to do this right now.

573
00:35:10.545 --> 00:35:11.372
- Just hold on.

574
00:35:14.027 --> 00:35:15.724
It's like. you're saying
we're never going to have-

575
00:35:15.811 --> 00:35:17.639
- I can't do this right now.

576
00:35:17.769 --> 00:35:18.683
- Okay. we haven't
talked about it.

577
00:35:18.814 --> 00:35:20.511
I mean. it's been-
- Not now.

578
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:23.601
I just want to give them something nice.

579
00:35:23.732 --> 00:35:26.256
He lives in a fucking box.

580
00:35:26.343 --> 00:35:27.040
Please.

581
00:35:28.258 --> 00:35:29.564
Please just give me five minutes.

582
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:31.696
- Just please don't
make this decision

583
00:35:31.783 --> 00:35:33.829
until we do talk about it.

584
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.570
You can have. take the time you need.

585
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.528
but you. can we not.

586
00:35:37.659 --> 00:35:40.183
just make a call on it yet?

587
00:35:40.314 --> 00:35:41.315
Let's talk about tomorrow.

588
00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.062
- Okay.
- Okay.

589
00:36:35.847 --> 00:36:38.024
You need help?

590
00:36:38.154 --> 00:36:40.548
- You look beautiful.

591
00:36:40.635 --> 00:36:42.158
- You look beautiful.

592
00:36:42.245 --> 00:36:44.334
No. I don't need any help.

593
00:36:44.421 --> 00:36:45.161
I got this.

594
00:36:45.248 --> 00:36:46.597
You do the table.

595
00:36:46.728 --> 00:36:48.686
I do the food prep.

596
00:36:48.817 --> 00:36:49.992
Everything is-
- Situation and-

597
00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:50.950
- Everything's
right on schedule.

598
00:36:51.037 --> 00:36:52.690
- I don't know that.
- It is.

599
00:36:52.821 --> 00:36:56.651
- I don't want us to end up
eating at like 11:30 at night.

600
00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:57.695
That's not going to happen.

601
00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:59.567
- It happened once.

602
00:36:59.697 --> 00:37:00.655
- That was not ny fault.

603
00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.874
That was a technical issue.

604
00:37:03.005 --> 00:37:03.963
It had nothing to do with me.

605
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.660
A little bit. your fault.

606
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.793
You sure you don't want help?

607
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.838
No. I'm good.

608
00:37:09.969 --> 00:37:10.752
You set the table.

609
00:37:10.839 --> 00:37:11.883
- I'm done setting the table.

610
00:37:12.014 --> 00:37:13.363
Okay. well just relax.

611
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:14.538
You can hang with me. but I'm good.

612
00:37:14.669 --> 00:37:15.452
I'm going to do the chopping.

613
00:37:15.539 --> 00:37:16.888
I got this under control.

614
00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:18.978
- Okay.

615
00:37:19.108 --> 00:37:20.936
I think I'm just going to grab a salad.

616
00:37:21.023 --> 00:37:22.198
- What. no. no.

617
00:37:22.285 --> 00:37:23.678
There's no salad in this.

618
00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.027
This does not include salad.

619
00:37:25.114 --> 00:37:26.420
- It's just a salad.

620
00:37:26.507 --> 00:37:27.290
- Please. please.
please. please.

621
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:27.987
There's no salad in this.

622
00:37:28.074 --> 00:37:28.857
There's no salad.

623
00:37:28.988 --> 00:37:30.641
I've got everything organized.

624
00:37:30.728 --> 00:37:31.642
Everything is going exactly
where it's supposed to go

625
00:37:31.729 --> 00:37:33.122
at the right time

626
00:37:33.253 --> 00:37:34.645
and I just don't want you
messing with it with salad.

627
00:37:34.732 --> 00:37:35.646
- Okay. I'm not messing with it.

628
00:37:35.733 --> 00:37:36.430
I just wanted to make. it's okay.

629
00:37:36.517 --> 00:37:37.779
- I know. I'm sorry.

630
00:37:37.866 --> 00:37:39.041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

631
00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:39.868
- It's okay.

632
00:37:42.653 --> 00:37:43.437
What's going on?

633
00:37:46.657 --> 00:37:47.702
Jason?

634
00:37:50.487 --> 00:37:51.184
Hey.

635
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.709
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

636
00:37:55.927 --> 00:38:00.323
You just been a little weird lately

637
00:38:00.454 --> 00:38:03.718
about food and particularly
the stuff with the sourdough

638
00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:04.806
and the sandwiches.

639
00:38:04.936 --> 00:38:08.375
The shit at the market with the pie.

640
00:38:08.462 --> 00:38:10.725
You've been chopping vegetables
for like an hour and a half.

641
00:38:12.292 --> 00:38:14.772
You snuck upstairs to have
that weird phone call.

642
00:38:14.903 --> 00:38:15.730
Little hushed voices.

643
00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.818
I heard you.

644
00:38:16.905 --> 00:38:18.080
- Oh no. that.

645
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:19.516
I didn't want to-

646
00:38:19.603 --> 00:38:20.126
- And since
when did we go upstairs

647
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:21.040
with hushed voices?

648
00:38:21.127 --> 00:38:22.519
- I didn't want you to hear it.

649
00:38:22.606 --> 00:38:23.390
Who were you talking to. then?

650
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.043
- Richard calling me about.

651
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.522
bugging me about pages.

652
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:26.349
And I didn't want you to
hear me have a work call

653
00:38:26.523 --> 00:38:28.786
'cause I said no work calls.

654
00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:30.179
And I promised we weren't
going to do that and then-

655
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.268
- Does Richard often
ask where I am?

656
00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:33.661
- What?

657
00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:34.531
- Why did you have
to explain to Richard

658
00:38:34.662 --> 00:38:35.445
where I was in the house?

659
00:38:35.532 --> 00:38:36.403
And my exact whereabouts?

660
00:38:36.533 --> 00:38:37.708
- I don't think I did that.

661
00:38:37.795 --> 00:38:39.667
- I absolutely
heard you say that.

662
00:38:39.754 --> 00:38:40.581
And then you got it

663
00:38:40.711 --> 00:38:41.930
and you're trying to work on it

664
00:38:42.017 --> 00:38:43.236
and you're trying to fix it.

665
00:38:44.498 --> 00:38:45.847
I'm sorry.

666
00:38:45.977 --> 00:38:47.196
The food thing is weird. I get it.

667
00:38:47.327 --> 00:38:48.632
I'm under a lot of pressure. okay?

668
00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:49.938
- Copy. Cool

669
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:51.505
What I'm saying is-

670
00:38:51.592 --> 00:38:52.897
- No. I understand.

671
00:38:52.984 --> 00:38:54.464
You're under a tremendous
amount of pressure.

672
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:56.075
I know.

673
00:38:56.162 --> 00:38:59.991
You have a ukulele deadline coming.

674
00:39:00.122 --> 00:39:00.731
You're under pressure.

675
00:39:00.862 --> 00:39:01.819
I got it.

676
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.604
You're under pressure.

677
00:39:03.734 --> 00:39:05.084
- It is not possible that I
could also be under pressure?

678
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:07.086
- It's not possible
for you to be

679
00:39:07.173 --> 00:39:08.652
under the same amount of pressure.

680
00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:10.393
- Did I say-

681
00:39:10.524 --> 00:39:11.525
Did I say that I was under
the same amount of pressure?

682
00:39:11.612 --> 00:39:13.004
- You used the word pressure.

683
00:39:13.092 --> 00:39:14.615
What possible pressures
do you have in your life?

684
00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:16.007
- You know. what's-

685
00:39:16.095 --> 00:39:17.835
- To make you go so
strange and crazy

686
00:39:17.966 --> 00:39:19.968
to sneak around and
have strange phone calls

687
00:39:20.055 --> 00:39:22.884
to be so obsessed with food.

688
00:39:23.014 --> 00:39:25.104
- Jen. there's a lot
going on right now. okay.

689
00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:26.844
- What is going on. then?

690
00:39:26.975 --> 00:39:29.064
- I'm trying to support
you and be there for you.

691
00:39:29.151 --> 00:39:30.326
And I'm just.

692
00:39:30.413 --> 00:39:31.197
I'm constantly trying to lift you up.

693
00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.024
- That's your job as my husband!

694
00:39:33.112 --> 00:39:35.157
- You have no idea
what I'm doing

695
00:39:35.244 --> 00:39:36.637
to help you find your cure. okay?

696
00:39:36.724 --> 00:39:38.073
- I have no idea?

697
00:39:38.204 --> 00:39:39.509
I'm lifting
you up. all the time.

698
00:39:39.596 --> 00:39:41.207
- You're doing nothing except
playing the fucking banjo.

699
00:39:41.337 --> 00:39:42.947
- How can you say that to me!

700
00:39:43.034 --> 00:39:45.994
- And chopping vegetables.
is all you're doing.

701
00:39:46.081 --> 00:39:47.996
That's all you ever do is sit on your ass.

702
00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:49.824
It took you 10 years to write a book.

703
00:39:49.911 --> 00:39:51.869
It takes you 10 years to do anything.

704
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.349
Don't tell me you're helping me.

705
00:39:53.436 --> 00:39:54.785
Do you think I want to be here?

706
00:39:54.872 --> 00:39:56.091
- I don't want to
do this anymore!

707
00:39:56.222 --> 00:39:57.223
- I don't want to do
this anymore. either.

708
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.049
- I don't want to
do this anymore!

709
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.355
- I don't want to do it either.

710
00:39:59.442 --> 00:40:00.226
Great. we're on the same page.

711
00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:01.749
- They're here!

712
00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:04.143
They're here.

713
00:40:10.497 --> 00:40:11.367
- Hi.

714
00:40:11.498 --> 00:40:12.151
Aww!

715
00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:17.939
Oh my God.

716
00:40:18.026 --> 00:40:19.549
- I know. it's been a minute.

717
00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:20.333
- Oh my God.

718
00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.379
- Hey. I'm coming in.

719
00:40:23.466 --> 00:40:24.075
Can I hug her first?

720
00:40:24.902 --> 00:40:26.948
It's okay. never mind.

721
00:40:27.035 --> 00:40:28.384
Hi.
- How are you?

722
00:40:28.471 --> 00:40:30.343
- Great. how are you?
- Good.

723
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.258
- Oh.
- Hey. welcome.

724
00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:33.172
- Congratulations.
- How you doing?

725
00:40:33.259 --> 00:40:34.608
- Good.
- You?

726
00:40:34.695 --> 00:40:35.913
- Good. what's that?

727
00:40:36.044 --> 00:40:36.697
No. I'm just happy for you guys.

728
00:40:36.784 --> 00:40:38.264
- Dessert. my man.

729
00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:39.047
- Okay.
- Two ounces of watermelon.

730
00:40:39.178 --> 00:40:40.831
One ounce of water.

731
00:40:40.918 --> 00:40:42.964
- Seems like a fair trade.

732
00:40:43.094 --> 00:40:44.270
Let's be careful with it. shall we?

733
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.010
- What's happening.
how you feeling?

734
00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:46.968
- I can smell something.
- Good.

735
00:40:47.055 --> 00:40:47.708
- Yeah?
- How you'd doing?

736
00:40:47.795 --> 00:40:49.405
- Good. I'm great.

737
00:40:49.492 --> 00:40:51.973
- I'm good. how are you?
- Thank you for coming.

738
00:40:52.103 --> 00:40:53.627
- Of course.
- Taking up a little more.

739
00:40:53.714 --> 00:40:55.629
- How was the uh-
- How could I not come-

740
00:40:55.716 --> 00:40:57.065
- Be careful. careful
with the steps!

741
00:40:57.152 --> 00:40:58.632
- She's fine.
- How was the drive?

742
00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:01.417
- Please. let's not do
that anymore. this weekend.

743
00:41:01.504 --> 00:41:03.245
- This is a very-
- She's fine.

744
00:41:03.332 --> 00:41:07.031
- She has to help me upstairs.
- Precious cargo.

745
00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:17.868
- I'm so. so sorry.

746
00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.224
I really fucked up.

747
00:41:31.882 --> 00:41:32.622
- Yeah.

748
00:41:35.712 --> 00:41:36.409
Yeah.

749
00:41:38.237 --> 00:41:39.977
Yeah. so did I.

750
00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.240
We both did. right?

751
00:41:42.763 --> 00:41:43.807
- Yeah.

752
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:51.815
- So. how's it going?

753
00:41:58.909 --> 00:41:59.997
- Not well.

754
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.263
- Shit.

755
00:42:10.617 --> 00:42:12.445
God. is there any way we can just tell her?

756
00:42:13.402 --> 00:42:14.447
- Sammy.

757
00:42:14.534 --> 00:42:15.839
Sammy?

758
00:42:15.926 --> 00:42:16.623
Look at me.

759
00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:20.061
That is not an option.

760
00:42:20.148 --> 00:42:20.975
Do you get that?

761
00:42:30.332 --> 00:42:31.028
- Yeah.

762
00:42:33.509 --> 00:42:34.467
- We got this.

763
00:42:41.387 --> 00:42:44.041
You going to be a dad?

764
00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.565
- Yes. I'm going to be a dad.

765
00:42:45.695 --> 00:42:47.610
- You're gonna be a dad.

766
00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:48.307
- I know.

767
00:42:50.004 --> 00:42:51.440
How did that happen. Jennifer?

768
00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:54.617
I can tell you.

769
00:42:54.748 --> 00:42:56.010
How do you feel?

770
00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:56.880
- Um.

771
00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:00.319
I. you know.

772
00:43:02.843 --> 00:43:05.280
Are you okay to talk about this?

773
00:43:05.411 --> 00:43:07.021
- Yes.
- Seriously for real?

774
00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.937
- Oh. um. thank you.

775
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.547
Yeah. Yes.

776
00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:15.116
- I'm going to have a kid.
- I know.

777
00:43:15.203 --> 00:43:16.987
- In like three months.

778
00:43:17.118 --> 00:43:18.206
Come on. look where we live.

779
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.512
Look. what's happening.

780
00:43:21.209 --> 00:43:22.776
How am I supposed to welcome
someone into the world.

781
00:43:22.906 --> 00:43:24.343
knowing that?

782
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.345
- You're going to fix this

783
00:43:26.432 --> 00:43:28.434
and you're going to do it with me.

784
00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:31.088
And so. the baby's going to be fine

785
00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:31.872
and you're going to be fine.

786
00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:34.614
It's okay to be scared.

787
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:35.354
You should be.

788
00:43:37.268 --> 00:43:38.313
You'll probably fuck it up.

789
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.054
You will fuck it up.

790
00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:41.925
- Thank you. Jennifer.

791
00:43:42.012 --> 00:43:43.362
- You're welcome.

792
00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.150
- How are you. really?

793
00:43:49.237 --> 00:43:50.194
How's the weekend going?

794
00:43:52.501 --> 00:43:54.068
- I don't know.
I'm a little lost.

795
00:43:56.287 --> 00:43:57.027
- How so?

796
00:43:58.899 --> 00:43:59.943
- I just. uh.

797
00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:05.209
Before you came. we had a fight.

798
00:44:05.296 --> 00:44:08.691
just devolved into madness.

799
00:44:08.822 --> 00:44:11.128
And I said things and he said things

800
00:44:11.259 --> 00:44:13.043
and they were hurtful
and they were bad and...

801
00:44:15.437 --> 00:44:17.396
- I think we got to
give them some slack.

802
00:44:17.483 --> 00:44:19.136
I mean. both of them.

803
00:44:19.267 --> 00:44:21.835
Just think of the
pressure they're under.

804
00:44:21.922 --> 00:44:24.533
They're trying to take care
of us and connect to us.

805
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.362
We're off doing. God
knows what. in their eyes.

806
00:44:27.493 --> 00:44:28.929
They don't understand what we're doing.

807
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:32.236
They just see what we're coming home.

808
00:44:32.323 --> 00:44:33.629
weighted down with every night.

809
00:44:33.716 --> 00:44:34.195
And they're trying to
figure out how to love us.

810
00:44:34.282 --> 00:44:36.110
And that's...

811
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.328
So he's been tasked with trying

812
00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:38.982
to give you a good weekend here.

813
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:40.767
a relaxing weekend.

814
00:44:40.897 --> 00:44:43.509
a way to get rid of all the
other stresses as best he can.

815
00:44:43.596 --> 00:44:45.598
And he doesn't understand
that. that's impossible.

816
00:44:47.904 --> 00:44:48.992
He loves you so much.

817
00:44:52.693 --> 00:44:54.042
- I know.

818
00:44:54.129 --> 00:44:57.262
- Just try to give
over to it. you know?

819
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:58.307
And cut off some slack.

820
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:01.179
- Thank you.

821
00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:05.488
- No problem.

822
00:45:08.448 --> 00:45:09.187
- Are we done?

823
00:45:10.232 --> 00:45:12.016
- Jesus. Come on.

824
00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:13.975
- I just want to
know if it's over.

825
00:45:14.105 --> 00:45:16.151
It was nice.

826
00:45:17.544 --> 00:45:18.501
So welcome to Colombia.

827
00:45:19.676 --> 00:45:21.504
is the unofficial national dish.

828
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:24.725
So don't be intimidated by
the number of dishes you see

829
00:45:24.812 --> 00:45:26.378
'cause it all comes
together on your plate.

830
00:45:26.509 --> 00:45:28.729
You can just start with rice.

831
00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.426
You're going to add red beans.

832
00:45:30.557 --> 00:45:33.081
which is cooked through
with slow roasted pork.

833
00:45:33.168 --> 00:45:34.343
We've got ground beef.

834
00:45:34.474 --> 00:45:37.085
I've got a chorizo and more pork.

835
00:45:37.215 --> 00:45:38.913
Plantains. fried plantain.

836
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.915
and then you've got fresh avocado.

837
00:45:41.002 --> 00:45:42.569
There's no right or wrong way to do this.

838
00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:44.919
- I just wanted to
ask you traditionally-

839
00:45:45.049 --> 00:45:46.529
- Yeah.

840
00:45:46.616 --> 00:45:48.400
- This dish is served
single serving.

841
00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:50.054
It's never served family style.

842
00:45:50.185 --> 00:45:51.360
So I'm curious about
why you made the choice

843
00:45:51.491 --> 00:45:52.709
to do it this way.

844
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.757
- I guess I'm giving
it my own twist.

845
00:45:56.844 --> 00:45:58.367
Give me a fried egg.

846
00:45:58.454 --> 00:46:00.151
- The yolk is usually runny.

847
00:46:00.238 --> 00:46:01.544
- Ah. you really boned up

848
00:46:01.631 --> 00:46:03.590
on your Colombian food history. there.

849
00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:05.766
- I did. about 20 years.
- He lived in Colombia.

850
00:46:05.853 --> 00:46:07.332
- Oh. you lived in Colombia?
- We lived there.

851
00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:08.595
- So you actually.

852
00:46:08.725 --> 00:46:10.118
you've eaten the real thing.
- Yeah.

853
00:46:10.248 --> 00:46:11.728
- How's it taste. though?

854
00:46:12.816 --> 00:46:14.252
- It's tastes great.

855
00:46:14.383 --> 00:46:15.558
The Elliot stamp of approval.

856
00:46:15.645 --> 00:46:16.559
- Thank you. man.
- You did it.

857
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:17.734
- I appreciate it.

858
00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:19.040
- And most
importantly. at least.

859
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.607
we're not being
served at 1:00 a.m.

860
00:46:20.737 --> 00:46:22.696
Oh.

861
00:46:24.785 --> 00:46:25.960
- Is this never
going to be forgiven?

862
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:26.917
- No.

863
00:46:27.004 --> 00:46:28.615
- It was a technical issue.

864
00:46:31.443 --> 00:46:34.838
- I desperately want you
guys to tell the story

865
00:46:34.969 --> 00:46:36.448
of your very first date.

866
00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:37.406
- I've heard enough about it.

867
00:46:37.537 --> 00:46:38.538
I don't know that we need to-

868
00:46:38.668 --> 00:46:39.843
- You need to hear
the story. it's fun.

869
00:46:39.974 --> 00:46:41.541
- It wasn't a date.
- It was. yeah.

870
00:46:41.628 --> 00:46:42.977
- It was a date
and it was a kiss.

871
00:46:43.107 --> 00:46:44.456
- No.

872
00:46:44.587 --> 00:46:45.501
You lept like Clark Kent into the crowd

873
00:46:45.588 --> 00:46:48.460
and suddenly started body surfing.

874
00:46:48.548 --> 00:46:50.898
It was just like hands on
butts and boots and faces.

875
00:46:51.028 --> 00:46:52.377
- Hands on butts?
- Oh. I mean. yeah.

876
00:46:52.464 --> 00:46:53.901
- People are propelling you.
- 'Cause they're passing-

877
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:55.250
- They're passing
you from one to the other.

878
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.034
- Oh. I thought you
meant your hands.

879
00:46:57.121 --> 00:46:58.645
Your hands were on-
- No.

880
00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:01.822
- That's another version.
- No. it was like. yeah.

881
00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:04.085
So you got pushed into kissing?

882
00:47:04.215 --> 00:47:04.912
You were forced into it.
- Pushed into. yes.

883
00:47:05.042 --> 00:47:06.435
Physical contact.

884
00:47:06.522 --> 00:47:08.872
- And threw you into
a passionate kiss.

885
00:47:09.003 --> 00:47:10.570
- It was not a passionate kiss.

886
00:47:10.657 --> 00:47:12.441
- And that was all
we needed to know.

887
00:47:12.572 --> 00:47:13.703
That was-

888
00:47:13.834 --> 00:47:15.009
- The first one
doesn't sound romantic.

889
00:47:15.096 --> 00:47:16.184
But was the second one romantic?

890
00:47:16.314 --> 00:47:18.273
The second kiss?

891
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.883
- It was like
literally two seconds.

892
00:47:20.014 --> 00:47:21.276
Tried again and it was-

893
00:47:21.406 --> 00:47:22.364
- It wasn't even a do-over.

894
00:47:22.494 --> 00:47:23.670
So you remember that right?

895
00:47:23.757 --> 00:47:24.496
- You were trying to
finish what you started?

896
00:47:24.627 --> 00:47:25.802
- And we could tell instantly-

897
00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:27.151
- And definitely.
- There was nothing going on.

898
00:47:27.238 --> 00:47:28.370
Nope.

899
00:47:28.457 --> 00:47:29.676
- Well. it's interesting.

900
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.807
how many times you told the story.

901
00:47:30.894 --> 00:47:32.243
How come we're only hearing this now?

902
00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:33.549
- You never wanted
to hear it before.

903
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.245
- I heard some of this.
- You find it amusing.

904
00:47:34.376 --> 00:47:35.290
- It's hilarious.

905
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.944
- It's such a boring story.

906
00:47:37.074 --> 00:47:39.468
- You wanna maybe tell us
about any other kisses?

907
00:47:41.296 --> 00:47:41.862
Is there a
third. or a fourth or a fifth?

908
00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.254
- Yeah. exactly.

909
00:47:43.341 --> 00:47:44.560
- Maybe we should
go to a concert.

910
00:47:44.691 --> 00:47:45.866
Yeah. let's go bang teeth.

911
00:47:48.346 --> 00:47:50.261
- I'm gonna try some
of the crazy hot sauce.

912
00:47:51.393 --> 00:47:52.176
You wanna try it?

913
00:47:55.179 --> 00:47:55.745
- I'll follow you.

914
00:47:57.051 --> 00:47:58.443
- What is. the frig is this?

915
00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:00.271
I'll follow you. business?

916
00:48:00.358 --> 00:48:02.839
- The first summer after we
hooked up. I had to leave.

917
00:48:02.926 --> 00:48:05.059
- After we hooked up.
- Less romantic.

918
00:48:05.146 --> 00:48:07.322
- To go back to Winnipeg
to work at my dad's store.

919
00:48:07.452 --> 00:48:08.497
- I thought we would.

920
00:48:08.584 --> 00:48:09.629
I did not think we were going to see-

921
00:48:09.716 --> 00:48:11.239
- Totally gone.
- Until he came-

922
00:48:11.326 --> 00:48:12.153
- Taking the summer off.

923
00:48:12.283 --> 00:48:14.242
And then I get to my dad's.

924
00:48:14.372 --> 00:48:15.199
One of the first day.

925
00:48:15.286 --> 00:48:15.896
the first morning.

926
00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:16.810
Who walks in the door?

927
00:48:16.897 --> 00:48:17.680
The first customer in the door.

928
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:19.464
And she said. I followed you.

929
00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:20.901
And this became our...

930
00:48:20.988 --> 00:48:22.685
It didn't become a thing
until the next year

931
00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:24.078
when we graduated

932
00:48:24.165 --> 00:48:25.645
and you got into the
master's program at UVic

933
00:48:25.775 --> 00:48:28.560
and I gave up my life to go and follow you.

934
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.344
You gave up your life?

935
00:48:29.474 --> 00:48:30.345
- Well. you know.

936
00:48:30.475 --> 00:48:31.563
brought my life with me-

937
00:48:31.694 --> 00:48:33.653
- With you. as I
brought my life. yeah.

938
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.654
And that's the thing.

939
00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:35.959
- And then. we kept doing that.

940
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.352
And then you kept doing that.

941
00:48:37.482 --> 00:48:38.745
- Well. I went to
Dublin for the PhD.

942
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:41.443
- Followed her again
and then again.

943
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.054
And then you followed her again.

944
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:45.882
Well.

945
00:48:45.969 --> 00:48:48.145
There's reciprocity in the following.

946
00:48:48.276 --> 00:48:52.062
It's not just him sort of
stalking me around the globe.

947
00:48:52.193 --> 00:48:53.760
I understand.
you're both following in love.

948
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.632
- Aww.
- It's a beautiful story.

949
00:48:56.719 --> 00:48:58.199
- Thank you.
- Aww.

950
00:48:59.504 --> 00:49:01.724
- That's a good one.
- Hmm.

951
00:49:03.552 --> 00:49:04.596
- Well. that's the story.

952
00:49:04.727 --> 00:49:05.989
- It's a good one.
- It's a great one.

953
00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.774
- And I have no idea-
- Thank you for sharing.

954
00:49:07.904 --> 00:49:09.993
Thank you for asking.

955
00:49:13.214 --> 00:49:14.519
I want more than five. though.

956
00:49:15.303 --> 00:49:16.130
Savor it.

957
00:49:21.178 --> 00:49:22.397
- Nice!

958
00:49:23.528 --> 00:49:24.573
- Try it again.
- So. what-

959
00:49:26.706 --> 00:49:28.403
- Oh my gosh. I got it close.

960
00:49:29.665 --> 00:49:31.362
- Good shot.
- Perfect.

961
00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:35.627
- Nailed it.
- Yes.

962
00:49:35.758 --> 00:49:37.542
- Your point.
- Oh. that was terrible.

963
00:49:37.629 --> 00:49:38.979
Good effort. good effort.

964
00:49:39.066 --> 00:49:40.937
- One more time for the baby.
- Good effort.

965
00:49:41.024 --> 00:49:43.287
- A for effort.
- That was a half measure.

966
00:49:46.726 --> 00:49:47.552
- This is fun.

967
00:49:48.815 --> 00:49:50.207
- Nope. no. no. no.

968
00:49:50.294 --> 00:49:51.556
- You gotta redo.
- Look over there.

969
00:49:51.643 --> 00:49:53.341
- You want some of this?
- Okay.

970
00:49:55.996 --> 00:49:57.345
- You're counting
your ounces today?

971
00:49:57.432 --> 00:49:58.389
- Don't worry about me.

972
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:03.481
Hmm.

973
00:50:03.612 --> 00:50:05.396
Measures out so we each get five pieces.

974
00:50:05.483 --> 00:50:06.615
You've had more than five pieces.

975
00:50:06.702 --> 00:50:07.485
- I know what I'm doing. okay.

976
00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:08.225
- It's gonna fuck you up if you-

977
00:50:08.312 --> 00:50:09.879
- I know what I'm doing.

978
00:50:11.228 --> 00:50:12.490
- Great.

979
00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:14.101
- Since I can't bend over.
- Nice.

980
00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:16.756
- My turn.
- Yep.

981
00:50:18.714 --> 00:50:21.282
- I wanna apologize
for. um. something.

982
00:50:23.066 --> 00:50:24.154
I uh...

983
00:50:25.852 --> 00:50:28.071
I've just taken Elliot
away. a lot for work.

984
00:50:28.202 --> 00:50:29.725
And I know that right now.

985
00:50:29.856 --> 00:50:30.726
you should be with your husband and-

986
00:50:30.813 --> 00:50:31.727
- It's okay.
- And I felt bad about it.

987
00:50:31.814 --> 00:50:33.076
- No. please.
- I know.

988
00:50:33.207 --> 00:50:33.990
- You have to do
what you have to do.

989
00:50:34.077 --> 00:50:35.165
- Right.
- It's fine.

990
00:50:35.252 --> 00:50:36.993
And I'm not alone.

991
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.212
I mean. you've got Elliot.

992
00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:39.474
And I've got Jason.

993
00:50:40.605 --> 00:50:42.477
- Wait. okay.
- But.

994
00:50:42.607 --> 00:50:43.826
Having lunch once a week

995
00:50:43.913 --> 00:50:45.697
does not make up for a missing husband.

996
00:50:45.828 --> 00:50:48.222
- And dinner and movies

997
00:50:48.352 --> 00:50:50.224
and card games

998
00:50:50.311 --> 00:50:51.921
and you know.

999
00:50:52.052 --> 00:50:52.879
whatever Jason wants to do.

1000
00:50:53.009 --> 00:50:53.749
I'm like. okay.

1001
00:50:53.836 --> 00:50:55.533
So. I'm far from alone.

1002
00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.449
It's fine. please.

1003
00:50:58.536 --> 00:51:00.321
Don't ever feel like you need to apologize.

1004
00:51:02.236 --> 00:51:02.802
Oh!

1005
00:51:04.847 --> 00:51:06.501
So you'll go first. Sammy.

1006
00:51:06.631 --> 00:51:08.982
You'll pick five
questions out of the bowl.

1007
00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:15.031
- Which family
member annoys you?

1008
00:51:15.118 --> 00:51:16.467
- Elliot. what'd you get?

1009
00:51:16.554 --> 00:51:19.470
- That would be
your racist uncle.

1010
00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:21.603
- Yes. I'm going to go
with uncle Tim. as well.

1011
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.691
He is racist and he is-

1012
00:51:22.822 --> 00:51:24.258
- Your uncle Tim is racist?

1013
00:51:24.388 --> 00:51:25.868
Sorry.

1014
00:51:25.955 --> 00:51:26.608
- And he was an
inappropriate tickler.

1015
00:51:26.695 --> 00:51:27.696
- He's not inappropriate.

1016
00:51:27.827 --> 00:51:29.611
He's just a tickle monster.

1017
00:51:29.698 --> 00:51:30.394
- Well. that's inappropriate.

1018
00:51:30.481 --> 00:51:31.395
What do you got?

1019
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.050
- Your mom.

1020
00:51:34.137 --> 00:51:35.051
- Well. I think Elliot
would agree with that.

1021
00:51:35.138 --> 00:51:35.747
- Hmm hmm.

1022
00:51:35.878 --> 00:51:36.487
- What was your answer?

1023
00:51:36.618 --> 00:51:37.532
- Uncle Tim.

1024
00:51:37.662 --> 00:51:38.925
- Hmm. I get a point.

1025
00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:40.709
Okay. Second question.

1026
00:51:40.796 --> 00:51:44.974
- What I most like
about the weekend?

1027
00:51:46.454 --> 00:51:47.585
- Morning sex.

1028
00:51:47.672 --> 00:51:48.325
I know this.

1029
00:51:48.456 --> 00:51:49.761
I shouldn't-

1030
00:51:49.892 --> 00:51:50.458
- Uh oh. Elliot.

1031
00:51:50.588 --> 00:51:52.155
What'd you get?

1032
00:51:52.286 --> 00:51:53.853
- My cooking is a favorite
part of her weekend.

1033
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.333
- I'm going to go
with the sleep in.

1034
00:51:56.464 --> 00:51:59.293
- Yes. you're all right.

1035
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.903
- But what did you write
down. as the question?

1036
00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:03.514
- Lately. you know.

1037
00:52:03.601 --> 00:52:04.820
it's definitely been the sleep in.

1038
00:52:04.907 --> 00:52:06.169
Ah.

1039
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.692
- But I'll take your
cooking any day.

1040
00:52:09.564 --> 00:52:11.131
Favorite smell.

1041
00:52:11.218 --> 00:52:14.351
- Her favorite smell is Musk.

1042
00:52:14.482 --> 00:52:15.787
- Hmm. okay.

1043
00:52:15.918 --> 00:52:17.398
I also have Musk. but I'm doing.

1044
00:52:17.528 --> 00:52:18.747
I'm guessing a three-way tie

1045
00:52:18.834 --> 00:52:21.184
between Musk. Jasmine and lilacs.

1046
00:52:21.315 --> 00:52:21.881
What do you got?

1047
00:52:22.751 --> 00:52:25.058
- I said food.

1048
00:52:26.581 --> 00:52:28.104
- So vague.
- Not the worst guess.

1049
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:29.149
- No. mine's vague.

1050
00:52:29.236 --> 00:52:30.846
Yours is very. very specific.

1051
00:52:30.977 --> 00:52:31.847
- I'll tell ya what.
I know I'm right

1052
00:52:31.934 --> 00:52:32.804
and I'll tell you why.

1053
00:52:32.935 --> 00:52:33.544
- It's pretty specific.

1054
00:52:33.675 --> 00:52:34.763
- You know. right?

1055
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.156
- What did you say mine was?

1056
00:52:36.243 --> 00:52:36.896
- It's Musk.

1057
00:52:37.853 --> 00:52:40.812
- Okay baby. you're not wrong.

1058
00:52:40.943 --> 00:52:41.596
But you're the most right.

1059
00:52:41.726 --> 00:52:44.425
- So round two.

1060
00:52:44.555 --> 00:52:47.907
how often would I like to have sex.

1061
00:52:47.994 --> 00:52:49.821
- Don't care.
- Every single day.

1062
00:52:49.952 --> 00:52:51.693
- Hmm.
- Probably twice a day.

1063
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.216
Maybe three times a day.

1064
00:52:53.347 --> 00:52:54.217
- What did you write down?

1065
00:52:54.348 --> 00:52:56.002
- I wrote every single day.

1066
00:52:56.132 --> 00:52:57.786
- Every single day.
- Every day.

1067
00:52:57.873 --> 00:52:59.875
- Elliot. what do you think
is my sexual appetite?

1068
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.704
- That's interesting.

1069
00:53:02.834 --> 00:53:05.402
'cause I actually down.
half to one time a week.

1070
00:53:07.448 --> 00:53:09.363
- Okay.

1071
00:53:09.493 --> 00:53:10.103
Sammy?

1072
00:53:11.756 --> 00:53:12.453
- Three times a week.

1073
00:53:15.804 --> 00:53:17.501
- I wrote down
three times a week.

1074
00:53:17.632 --> 00:53:20.548
But I'm sure that
Jennifer is much more correct.

1075
00:53:20.635 --> 00:53:21.984
- Every day would be splendid.

1076
00:53:22.115 --> 00:53:22.942
- Yes.
- I just.

1077
00:53:23.029 --> 00:53:24.204
I didn't want to push it.

1078
00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:25.770
I didn't want to push my luck.

1079
00:53:29.252 --> 00:53:30.210
Okay.

1080
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.167
Four and...

1081
00:53:31.254 --> 00:53:34.431
What is a skill that I have.

1082
00:53:35.476 --> 00:53:37.608
that nobody else knows about?

1083
00:53:37.695 --> 00:53:39.001
- Sweetheart. what'd you get?

1084
00:53:39.088 --> 00:53:41.438
- I just only found
this out recently.

1085
00:53:42.744 --> 00:53:44.093
Playing the banjo.

1086
00:53:45.573 --> 00:53:46.313
- It's a ukulele.

1087
00:53:47.618 --> 00:53:48.358
Elliot?

1088
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:51.883
- Just grasping at straws here.

1089
00:53:52.014 --> 00:53:53.537
Sleep doctor.

1090
00:53:56.845 --> 00:54:00.631
Right?

1091
00:54:03.808 --> 00:54:04.809
- Why is that funny?

1092
00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.638
- No. this is drinking
too much watermelon

1093
00:54:07.725 --> 00:54:10.511
and getting just a tad water toxic.

1094
00:54:10.598 --> 00:54:12.774
So Sammy?

1095
00:54:12.904 --> 00:54:14.732
- I know it's the ukulele.
- You okay?

1096
00:54:14.863 --> 00:54:16.778
- But another string instrument.

1097
00:54:16.865 --> 00:54:18.040
- She meant ukulele.

1098
00:54:18.127 --> 00:54:18.823
by the way.
- I'm sure.

1099
00:54:18.954 --> 00:54:20.042
- Yeah.
- Number four.

1100
00:54:20.129 --> 00:54:21.435
What is my favorite dessert?

1101
00:54:21.522 --> 00:54:22.697
- I don't know.

1102
00:54:22.827 --> 00:54:24.699
- My favorite dessert. come on.

1103
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:25.874
- What'd you write down?

1104
00:54:26.005 --> 00:54:27.919
- Sam. tell me.

1105
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.271
- Well. I only know 'cause if
it's not really. really warm.

1106
00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:32.533
you send it back.
- Ah!

1107
00:54:34.013 --> 00:54:35.753
- It's molten
chocolate lava cake.

1108
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.233
- But you knew this.

1109
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.582
She knew that. too.

1110
00:54:38.713 --> 00:54:40.671
- I'm sure it's changed.
but like for 20 years.

1111
00:54:40.758 --> 00:54:42.151
- You know what guys.
you don't have to explain

1112
00:54:42.282 --> 00:54:44.284
and rationalize every answer. okay?

1113
00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:45.676
You guys are good friends. that's fine.

1114
00:54:45.763 --> 00:54:46.634
- Didn't know that was
one of the rules. yeah.

1115
00:54:46.721 --> 00:54:48.027
- Probably because you guys

1116
00:54:48.157 --> 00:54:49.071
are just spending every day together.

1117
00:54:49.158 --> 00:54:50.117
- Well. there's a whole
thing with the smells.

1118
00:54:50.247 --> 00:54:51.857
- See. this is what
I don't I understand.

1119
00:54:51.944 --> 00:54:53.250
If you guys have been spending
all this time together.

1120
00:54:53.337 --> 00:54:54.730
- Hmm hmm.

1121
00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:55.905
- Are you writing?

1122
00:54:56.036 --> 00:54:58.125
Where is. how you working on your book?

1123
00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:01.867
He hasn't
touched it in six months.

1124
00:55:05.088 --> 00:55:07.525
You know. been doing other things. right?

1125
00:55:08.744 --> 00:55:10.789
Other skills. life skills.

1126
00:55:11.964 --> 00:55:13.575
Like hanging out skills.

1127
00:55:13.705 --> 00:55:16.230
Learning an instrument. right?

1128
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.408
- Yeah. um.

1129
00:55:21.452 --> 00:55:23.759
Sorry. you said. you know.

1130
00:55:23.889 --> 00:55:24.934
just because you guys have
been going out to lunch.

1131
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:26.631
he hasn't touched his book in six months?

1132
00:55:26.762 --> 00:55:27.980
- I mean. maybe he has.

1133
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:29.156
As far as I know. I don't know.

1134
00:55:29.286 --> 00:55:30.766
- No. no. no. it's
been off and on.

1135
00:55:30.896 --> 00:55:31.636
I mean. it's-
- Yeah.

1136
00:55:33.682 --> 00:55:35.640
Well. yeah. we should go.

1137
00:55:35.771 --> 00:55:37.860
- Yeah. we should-

00:55:37.947 --> 00:55:38.817
- Yeah.

1139
00:55:38.904 --> 00:55:39.862
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1140
00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:41.733
I can drive.

1141
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.431
- No.
- I can drive. yeah.

1142
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:45.955
Easy does it.

1143
00:55:46.086 --> 00:55:46.738
Step.

1144
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:49.741
Thank you. so much.

1145
00:55:49.828 --> 00:55:50.916
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for coming. guys.

1146
00:55:51.003 --> 00:55:52.875
- That was a fantastic day.

1147
00:55:52.962 --> 00:55:53.963
- It really was. guys.

1148
00:55:54.094 --> 00:55:55.747
You knocked yourselves out.

1149
00:55:55.878 --> 00:55:56.966
Thank you so much.

1150
00:55:57.097 --> 00:55:57.749
Key?

1151
00:55:59.142 --> 00:56:01.057
- That's good.
- Okay.

1152
00:56:01.188 --> 00:56:02.841
- See ya. Monday.
- See ya. Monday!

1153
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:33.785
- Hey.
- Hey.

1154
00:56:33.872 --> 00:56:35.178
- Water. I brought
your water up.

1155
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:37.093
You still have like. 10 left.

1156
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.051
even with the watermelon. so.

1157
00:56:39.182 --> 00:56:41.053
That's good.
- Thank you.

1158
00:56:41.184 --> 00:56:42.316
- You got a good drink tonight.

1159
00:56:54.676 --> 00:56:56.330
- Getting an early jump on the-

1160
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.857
What are you doing?

1161
00:57:05.208 --> 00:57:06.688
- Don't ask me stupid questions.

1162
00:57:06.818 --> 00:57:08.429
Don't do that.

1163
00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:09.952
- Put your stuff-
- Don't do that.

1164
00:57:10.039 --> 00:57:11.171
- Put your stuff away.

1165
00:57:17.438 --> 00:57:19.831
- Why have you been lying
to me about your book?

1166
00:57:23.226 --> 00:57:23.922
No.

1167
00:57:28.188 --> 00:57:32.192
Why are you a liar?

1168
00:57:36.196 --> 00:57:37.893
You've been lying to me about your book.

1169
00:57:39.024 --> 00:57:40.069
You lied about Richard.

1170
00:57:41.723 --> 00:57:43.942
You lied about hanging
out with Sam every day.

1171
00:57:46.684 --> 00:57:49.296
So I'm packing because I
don't want to stick around

1172
00:57:49.383 --> 00:57:52.212
to find out how much more
you've been lying about.

1173
00:57:57.739 --> 00:57:59.567
Why were you lying to me about your book?

1174
00:58:01.699 --> 00:58:02.396
- Okay.

1175
00:58:03.658 --> 00:58:05.834
I stopped writing because I.

1176
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:07.531
I haven't been able to.

1177
00:58:07.662 --> 00:58:12.493
I haven't been able to write
because I don't see a point

1178
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.190
in writing a stupid book

1179
00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:15.844
about some civilization
that nobody cares about it.

1180
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:17.454
And...

1181
00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:18.412
- There's no point.

1182
00:58:19.761 --> 00:58:21.545
- Yeah.

1183
00:58:21.632 --> 00:58:22.111
- There's no point because
we're not going to make it.

1184
00:58:22.242 --> 00:58:23.939
There's no point because I.

1185
00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.814
I'm not going to be able to fix it.

1186
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.904
Then. why the fuck drag me up here?

1187
00:58:32.991 --> 00:58:34.079
If you think my work is pointless.

1188
00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:35.385
If you think that I am pointless.

1189
00:58:35.516 --> 00:58:36.865
If you think that what
I'm doing is pointless.

1190
00:58:36.952 --> 00:58:38.519
- No. no. no...

1191
00:58:38.606 --> 00:58:39.650
- I'm pointless?

1192
00:58:39.737 --> 00:58:40.390
- No!

1193
00:58:40.521 --> 00:58:41.261
You're. you're...

1194
00:58:41.348 --> 00:58:42.740
- You just said. it's pointless.

1195
00:58:44.394 --> 00:58:46.135
- I just meant. it's
hard to rationalize

1196
00:58:47.397 --> 00:58:49.312
me doing something so meaningless

1197
00:58:49.399 --> 00:58:50.792
when you're doing
something so meaningful.

1198
00:58:50.922 --> 00:58:51.532
- It's not what you've said.

1199
00:58:51.619 --> 00:58:52.881
You said it's pointless.

1200
00:58:52.968 --> 00:58:53.534
You said you didn't want to work on it

1201
00:58:53.664 --> 00:58:54.926
because it's pointless.

1202
00:58:55.013 --> 00:58:55.753
which means that you don't fucking

1203
00:58:58.321 --> 00:58:59.627
think that I can do it.

1204
00:59:02.282 --> 00:59:03.108
- You don't understand.

1205
00:59:03.195 --> 00:59:04.284
- I do understand.

1206
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:08.157
- Babe.
- Don't.

1207
00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:09.463
I need you to believe in me.

1208
00:59:11.813 --> 00:59:12.988
And you don't.

1209
00:59:15.164 --> 00:59:18.994
And on top of it. you're
fucking lying about it.

1210
00:59:21.779 --> 00:59:22.650
Who are you?

1211
00:59:25.087 --> 00:59:26.306
Why have you been lying about

1212
00:59:28.177 --> 00:59:32.050
the copious amounts of time
you've been with Sammy?

1213
00:59:34.096 --> 00:59:36.185
Tell me the truth.

1214
00:59:37.404 --> 00:59:39.057
because I think that you owe me that.

1215
00:59:42.931 --> 00:59:43.975
- Yeah.

1216
00:59:51.635 --> 00:59:53.376
So something happened between Sammy and I.

1217
00:59:53.463 --> 00:59:54.377
- Hmm hmm.

1218
00:59:54.508 --> 00:59:56.771
- One time.
- Hmm hmm.

1219
00:59:56.858 --> 00:59:58.468
- Earlier this year
and it was one night

1220
00:59:58.599 --> 01:00:01.428
and it was completely
stupid and meaningless.

1221
01:00:01.558 --> 01:00:03.995
And we do not feel that
way about each other.

1222
01:00:04.996 --> 01:00:05.910
And I love you so much.

1223
01:00:05.997 --> 01:00:07.172
- Fuck you.

1224
01:00:07.259 --> 01:00:09.697
- And it was a
stupid. stupid thing

1225
01:00:09.827 --> 01:00:11.351
and we both hated it and it was awful.

1226
01:00:11.438 --> 01:00:12.787
- Fuck you.
- And it was one time.

1227
01:00:12.874 --> 01:00:15.833
- You bring her into
my house where. when?

1228
01:00:15.964 --> 01:00:17.444
- Their house. their house.
you guys were working late.

1229
01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:20.272
You and Elliot were
working late. and...

1230
01:00:20.403 --> 01:00:21.535
When did this happen?

1231
01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:23.363
- In February?

1232
01:00:25.495 --> 01:00:27.367
It was February or March.
I don't remember exactly.

1233
01:00:27.454 --> 01:00:28.106
- Hmm hmm.

1234
01:00:30.413 --> 01:00:33.329
- No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no.

1235
01:00:33.416 --> 01:00:34.809
Don't even go there.

1236
01:00:34.896 --> 01:00:36.245
It's not. it's not that.

1237
01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.813
Honey. you gotta believe me.

1238
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.857
Please.

1239
01:00:39.944 --> 01:00:40.771
- Oh my God.
- No.

1240
01:00:49.258 --> 01:00:50.651
- Well. congratulations. Jason.

1241
01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:51.782
No.

1242
01:00:51.869 --> 01:00:53.480
- What am I suppose to do?

1243
01:00:57.179 --> 01:01:00.182
I can't believe...

1244
01:01:00.269 --> 01:01:03.315
Don't!

1245
01:01:03.446 --> 01:01:04.055
Don't!

1246
01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:07.407
I...

1247
01:01:10.105 --> 01:01:13.151
Fucking hate you.

1248
01:01:13.282 --> 01:01:14.805
- Don't say that.
please. don't say that.

1249
01:01:18.983 --> 01:01:19.854
- I don't!

1250
01:01:35.739 --> 01:01:36.871
Fuck!

1251
01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:53.801
- Did something happen?

1252
01:01:55.063 --> 01:01:56.325
- I'm leaving you.

1253
01:01:57.587 --> 01:01:59.154
That's what happened.

1254
01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:28.575
- Can you open your
window. please. Jennifer?

1255
01:02:30.707 --> 01:02:31.795
Hi. Jennifer.

1256
01:02:31.926 --> 01:02:32.622
I'm Dr. Lakeland. you remember?

1257
01:02:32.753 --> 01:02:33.536
We met yesterday.

1258
01:02:33.623 --> 01:02:34.668
I'm the neurologist.

1259
01:02:36.017 --> 01:02:37.322
I know. they're fine.

1260
01:02:37.409 --> 01:02:38.672
They're going to stay right there. okay.

1261
01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:40.848
So Jennifer. I need 10
minutes of your time. okay.

1262
01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.329
And then I'm going to tell you
everything that's going on.

1263
01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:45.287
- Now. is not a good time.

1264
01:02:45.374 --> 01:02:46.767
- I know. it's not.

1265
01:02:46.854 --> 01:02:49.639
Trust me. I know it's
not a good time for you.

1266
01:02:49.726 --> 01:02:51.467
I know it's not and I need just 10 minutes

1267
01:02:51.598 --> 01:02:53.425
and I promise you. I'm gonna
explain everything to you.

1268
01:02:53.513 --> 01:02:55.340
So you and I need to go
back in your house. please.

1269
01:02:55.427 --> 01:02:57.212
- I'm not going anywhere.

1270
01:02:57.342 --> 01:02:58.256
Who are those people?

1271
01:02:58.387 --> 01:02:59.170
- They're going to move.

1272
01:02:59.257 --> 01:03:00.302
as soon as we go in the house.

1273
01:03:00.389 --> 01:03:01.085
they're going to go.

1274
01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:04.045
They're just helping me right now.

1275
01:03:07.004 --> 01:03:08.440
I know. I know.

1276
01:03:08.571 --> 01:03:09.572
And I know it's the worst possible time

1277
01:03:09.659 --> 01:03:10.834
for me to be showing up
and doing this to you.

1278
01:03:10.965 --> 01:03:12.444
- How do you know?
- I'm gonna tell-

1279
01:03:12.532 --> 01:03:13.576
- What do you mean. you know?

1280
01:03:13.663 --> 01:03:14.621
- I'm going to tell
you everything.

1281
01:03:14.751 --> 01:03:16.405
I just want 10 minutes. okay. please.

1282
01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.146
I'm trying to help you
save the world. okay.

1283
01:03:18.233 --> 01:03:20.540
I need you to give me 10
minutes of your time. okay?

1284
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.763
Yeah. go in. okay.

1285
01:03:31.855 --> 01:03:32.552
Okay.

1286
01:03:34.205 --> 01:03:37.252
So. Jennifer. what I want you to do

1287
01:03:37.339 --> 01:03:40.734
is walk me through what happened
in here with Jason. okay?

1288
01:03:42.257 --> 01:03:44.085
Would it help you if he was in here?

1289
01:03:48.176 --> 01:03:49.090
- Yes.

1290
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.395
- Okay. Okay.

1291
01:03:51.919 --> 01:03:54.095
- Jason.
- Yeah.

1292
01:03:54.225 --> 01:03:56.445
- Can you come in. please?
- Yep.

1293
01:03:56.576 --> 01:03:59.274
- Okay. so. thank you so much.
- Yep.

1294
01:03:59.404 --> 01:04:00.580
- Both of you. okay.

1295
01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:01.842
Here's what we need you to do.
- Okay.

1296
01:04:04.018 --> 01:04:06.586
- I'd like. you two.
please. to walk me through

1297
01:04:07.717 --> 01:04:09.501
what happened.

1298
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:12.940
- She was there and I came in
with the water bottles and.

1299
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.335
I put hers here and. uh.

1300
01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:22.166
I drank from mine and then I put it here.

1301
01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:26.301
- And then he came over

1302
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:28.477
and told me that he was
fucking our best friend.

1303
01:04:31.045 --> 01:04:31.785
So. that happened.

1304
01:04:31.872 --> 01:04:33.134
Is that what you're looking for?

1305
01:04:33.264 --> 01:04:34.875
- Yeah. okay.

1306
01:04:34.962 --> 01:04:36.224
So how did you feel when he told you that?

1307
01:04:43.274 --> 01:04:44.667
- How would you feel?

1308
01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:45.494
- It doesn't matter
how I would feel.

1309
01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:46.974
I want to know how you felt.

1310
01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:50.848
- Like. I'm dying.

1311
01:04:52.937 --> 01:04:53.634
Betrayed.

1312
01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.855
And fucking angry and.

1313
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:03.818
heartbroken and I feel so stupid.

1314
01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:08.300
I feel like an idiot for trusting you.

1315
01:05:08.387 --> 01:05:10.215
I feel so stupid.

1316
01:05:10.302 --> 01:05:11.521
I feel gutted.

1317
01:05:13.915 --> 01:05:15.786
Like. I want to die.

1318
01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:18.571
but like. I want you to die. more.

1319
01:05:18.702 --> 01:05:20.312
And what did
you say to him after he told

1320
01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:21.400
you. what did you say to him?

1321
01:05:22.532 --> 01:05:23.968
- I went-
- Don't!

1322
01:05:24.099 --> 01:05:25.927
- Please. please. just
let him do it. okay?

1323
01:05:26.057 --> 01:05:26.710
Let him do it. please.

1324
01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:28.233
- I went for you.

1325
01:05:28.364 --> 01:05:29.539
- I don't even remember.

1326
01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:33.151
I don't know. he came and then I left

1327
01:05:33.238 --> 01:05:34.587
and I went to the bathroom

1328
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.329
and I collected my fucking
self because it was a moment.

1329
01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.157
And then I went to the car

1330
01:05:39.244 --> 01:05:41.594
and then you showed up with
whatever bullshit this is.

1331
01:05:41.725 --> 01:05:42.987
That's what happened.

1332
01:05:43.118 --> 01:05:44.467
- Okay. we're going
to do that. okay.

1333
01:05:48.297 --> 01:05:49.559
Okay. you can do this.

1334
01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.039
So tell me what you did
when you came in here.

1335
01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:57.306
- I closed the door.

1336
01:05:57.393 --> 01:05:58.002
- And did you close it?

1337
01:05:58.133 --> 01:05:59.438
How did you close it?

1338
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.184
What did you do next. Jennifer?

1339
01:06:06.315 --> 01:06:06.924
- I grabbed.

1340
01:06:08.056 --> 01:06:08.883
I don't know.

1341
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:09.884
I actually don't remember.

1342
01:06:10.885 --> 01:06:11.929
I slammed something.

1343
01:06:12.016 --> 01:06:13.975
Maybe like. I don't remember.

1344
01:06:14.062 --> 01:06:15.411
Do you
remember what you were feeling?

1345
01:06:16.368 --> 01:06:17.587
- Yes.

1346
01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:18.675
I don't remember what I did.

1347
01:06:18.762 --> 01:06:20.416
I don't understand what's going on.

1348
01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:21.809
I don't remember what happened.

1349
01:06:21.896 --> 01:06:23.811
I know the feeling if that's
what you're asking me.

1350
01:06:23.941 --> 01:06:25.203
That's what I'm asking you.

1351
01:06:26.639 --> 01:06:27.510
- The feeling?
- Yeah?

1352
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.903
We're going to stop this. okay.

1353
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.600
Frank?

1354
01:06:31.557 --> 01:06:33.951
You can come in. now.

1355
01:06:34.082 --> 01:06:34.735
- What?

1356
01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:42.917
- Dr. Lakeland.

1357
01:06:44.135 --> 01:06:45.484
- Come on. sit
down. please. Frank.

1358
01:06:45.571 --> 01:06:46.268
- Jennifer.

1359
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.185
- So. Jennifer.

1360
01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:52.622
I'm going to tell you
what's been going on. okay.

1361
01:06:52.753 --> 01:06:53.710
I want you to listen to me.

1362
01:06:53.841 --> 01:06:54.537
And when you have questions. of course.

1363
01:06:54.624 --> 01:06:55.625
you're going to have questions

1364
01:06:55.756 --> 01:06:57.496
and Frank and I.

1365
01:06:57.627 --> 01:06:59.716
we're going to try to answer
them as best we can. okay.

1366
01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:01.936
So. do you remember when
you woke up yesterday

1367
01:07:02.023 --> 01:07:03.676
and I told you.

1368
01:07:03.807 --> 01:07:06.244
you were suffering from
acute dissociative amnesia?

1369
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.203
Okay. so you had had a.

1370
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:11.075
like a stress-induced blackout

1371
01:07:11.206 --> 01:07:14.078
and you forgot about two days of your life.

1372
01:07:14.209 --> 01:07:16.602
So here's what happened
in those two days.

1373
01:07:16.689 --> 01:07:18.735
You came to this house with Jason.

1374
01:07:18.822 --> 01:07:20.781
You had a lovely day together.

1375
01:07:20.868 --> 01:07:21.999
You had a lovely night.

1376
01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:25.481
The next day you went to the market

1377
01:07:25.568 --> 01:07:26.743
and then your friends came over for dinner.

1378
01:07:26.874 --> 01:07:28.658
Samantha and Elliot came over for dinner.

1379
01:07:30.181 --> 01:07:33.619
They left and you and Jason went upstairs.

1380
01:07:34.577 --> 01:07:35.317
Then you had a fight.

1381
01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:40.670
You went into the loo by yourself.

1382
01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:41.802
And while you were in there.

1383
01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:44.979
you had an epiphany
about the water crisis.

1384
01:07:46.415 --> 01:07:48.112
We know this

1385
01:07:48.243 --> 01:07:50.027
because when you left.

1386
01:07:50.114 --> 01:07:52.551
you got in your car and you called Frank

1387
01:07:52.638 --> 01:07:53.857
and you left him a message.

1388
01:07:53.988 --> 01:07:55.641
And you told him that you had solved it.

1389
01:07:55.728 --> 01:07:57.121
that you had figured it out.

1390
01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.993
And you wanted him to
get your team together.

1391
01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.864
- No.
- Yes.

1392
01:08:00.951 --> 01:08:02.257
We don't know exactly
what happened after that

1393
01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:04.520
but you were found unconscious

1394
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.348
but unhurt on the side of the road.

1395
01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.179
Welcome back.

1396
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:13.355
- Why are you here?

1397
01:08:13.485 --> 01:08:14.965
- What's the last
thing you remember?

1398
01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:17.272
- I was at the office

1399
01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:21.015
and I ran downstairs to do some lunch.

1400
01:08:22.494 --> 01:08:23.582
Had a hamburger.

1401
01:08:24.453 --> 01:08:25.497
- That's it?

1402
01:08:26.672 --> 01:08:27.369
- And a hash brown.

1403
01:08:28.718 --> 01:08:29.762
- It was clear to Frank

1404
01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:32.156
that you did not remember calling him.

1405
01:08:32.287 --> 01:08:34.593
You did not remember having that epiphany.

1406
01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:36.726
And you did not remember
that whole weekend.

1407
01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:38.336
So here's what happened. okay.

1408
01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:40.904
You were medically sedated. safely.

1409
01:08:42.036 --> 01:08:43.472
And Frank called me.

1410
01:08:47.911 --> 01:08:49.782
Hello?
- Dr. Rebecca Lakeland?

1411
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:52.307
Right now there's a team waiting
for you outside your door

1412
01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:53.917
with our verification documents.

1413
01:08:54.048 --> 01:08:55.266
Take you to Auckland Airport

1414
01:08:55.353 --> 01:08:57.529
and put you on a plane to come here.

1415
01:08:57.616 --> 01:08:58.879
- I'm a memory specialist

1416
01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:02.447
and the work that I do is
around context dependent memory.

1417
01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:06.147
The context or the
situation that you're in.

1418
01:09:06.234 --> 01:09:08.279
when a memory is formed.

1419
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:11.195
that impacts the way that
that memory is retrieved.

1420
01:09:11.326 --> 01:09:12.980
So I'm going to interview.

1421
01:09:13.067 --> 01:09:14.590
I'm going to ask each of
you questions individually.

1422
01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.506
and I want you to think
in terms of senses. okay.

1423
01:09:17.593 --> 01:09:18.507
So go through. what did it smell like?

1424
01:09:18.637 --> 01:09:20.074
What did it tastes like?

1425
01:09:20.161 --> 01:09:20.770
What did it sound like?

1426
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:22.598
All those things.

1427
01:09:22.685 --> 01:09:26.558
And also in terms of physical
or emotional state. okay.

1428
01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:27.733
So what were you feeling?

1429
01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.170
What was Jennifer feeling?

1430
01:09:29.257 --> 01:09:31.041
Okay. the fascinating thing
about this kind of work

1431
01:09:31.172 --> 01:09:33.043
is that a person moving
through this sort of thing.

1432
01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:36.177
70% of the time. they're
going to repeat the behavior.

1433
01:09:36.307 --> 01:09:38.135
And if you feel her going off.

1434
01:09:38.222 --> 01:09:40.703
that's where you sort
of. as a group. you know.

1435
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:41.704
you get her back on.

1436
01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:43.445
Okay. so can you walk me through

1437
01:09:43.575 --> 01:09:45.403
what happened when Jennifer
came into the office?

1438
01:09:45.534 --> 01:09:49.016
- I just knew that she
needed some time off.

1439
01:09:49.146 --> 01:09:50.669
This isn't a request.

1440
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.281
- You and Sam are going
to come to dinner.

1441
01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:57.285
- We will go over dinner if
buddy makes Colombian food.

1442
01:09:57.415 --> 01:09:59.765
You're going up there just
to kind of be buffered.

1443
01:09:59.852 --> 01:10:01.593
- There's a piece of art.

1444
01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.639
a statue that's by the front door.

1445
01:10:03.769 --> 01:10:05.162
- You moved this.

1446
01:10:05.249 --> 01:10:06.772
- She kind of pretended
like she was okay with it.

1447
01:10:06.859 --> 01:10:08.470
but I could tell that she was not.

1448
01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.167
Okay. and
you said she was surprised to

1449
01:10:10.254 --> 01:10:11.864
know that you had learned the ukulele.

1450
01:10:11.995 --> 01:10:13.257
- You're sitting
here on the couch

1451
01:10:13.388 --> 01:10:16.260
and you're just sort of
performing for the whole house.

1452
01:10:16.391 --> 01:10:17.435
Do you want a standing ovation?

1453
01:10:17.566 --> 01:10:18.610
It's lovely.

1454
01:10:18.741 --> 01:10:20.047
Good job.

1455
01:10:20.177 --> 01:10:21.657
- I think we had
lunch after that.

1456
01:10:21.787 --> 01:10:25.182
I think there was turkey
sandwich with mayo and mustard.

1457
01:10:25.269 --> 01:10:27.097
Yeah. so then we went for a canoe ride.

1458
01:10:28.664 --> 01:10:30.231
We were having trouble
finding the rhythm.

1459
01:10:30.318 --> 01:10:31.623
It was a bit awkward.

1460
01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.060
I'm not afraid of drowning in it.

1461
01:10:33.147 --> 01:10:36.672
I just don't want to fall into
it and get all wet and cold.

1462
01:10:36.802 --> 01:10:38.108
We made a stir fry.

1463
01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:39.718
And we have a routine
when we make the stir fry

1464
01:10:39.805 --> 01:10:42.025
and it's like a dance. almost.

1465
01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.680
She fed me a piece of red pepper.

1466
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:46.856
Is she going to do that again?

1467
01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:48.075
Maybe. I hope so. I hope so.

1468
01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:49.990
I hope so that she has the same impulses.

1469
01:10:50.077 --> 01:10:51.426
- That'll be wild.
- Yeah.

1470
01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.775
- I knocked her
water bottle over

1471
01:10:52.862 --> 01:10:54.255
and before she could stop me.

1472
01:10:54.385 --> 01:10:56.648
I opened it up and I dumped my water out.

1473
01:10:56.779 --> 01:10:58.781
We made up a song.

1474
01:10:59.651 --> 01:11:01.566
- What is this?

1475
01:11:01.697 --> 01:11:05.440
- So we had an intimate
moment. on the swing.

1476
01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.485
She grabbed me and kissed me.
- Okay.

1477
01:11:08.573 --> 01:11:09.879
- This I remember.

1478
01:11:10.097 --> 01:11:12.142
because this hasn't
happened in a long time.

1479
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:13.796
So in the morning. I got up before she did.

1480
01:11:13.883 --> 01:11:15.319
Okay.

1481
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:18.105
- And I went downstairs and
I made her a cup of coffee

1482
01:11:18.192 --> 01:11:21.499
and we like to do a canoe.
a paddle before we eat.

1483
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:22.848
And the water was amazing.

1484
01:11:22.935 --> 01:11:24.198
It was a nice morning?

1485
01:11:24.328 --> 01:11:26.113
Yeah. it was a nice morning.

1486
01:11:26.243 --> 01:11:27.375
Okay.

1487
01:11:27.505 --> 01:11:27.810
- Went to the farmer's market.
- Yep.

1488
01:11:27.897 --> 01:11:28.811
- Get the pie?

1489
01:11:28.898 --> 01:11:29.855
- I did.

1490
01:11:29.942 --> 01:11:31.118
- It was an apple crumble

1491
01:11:31.248 --> 01:11:33.033
with the caramel like drizzled.

1492
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.382
Hammock time.

1493
01:11:34.512 --> 01:11:35.818
And she was reading.

1494
01:11:35.948 --> 01:11:37.472
Well. then we started
getting ready for dinner.

1495
01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:40.866
Pulled up in the
back of their farmhouse.

1496
01:11:40.953 --> 01:11:43.608
I remember that Jennifer
went to Samantha first

1497
01:11:43.695 --> 01:11:44.653
and said. hi.

1498
01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.741
- She was really happy.

1499
01:11:46.829 --> 01:11:48.091
Really happy to see me.

1500
01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:49.701
Jennifer and
Elliot went for a walk

1501
01:11:49.832 --> 01:11:51.181
to discuss work. I assume.

1502
01:11:51.312 --> 01:11:52.704
Do you
remember the route you took?

1503
01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:54.141
- Yeah. we were
over by the fence.

1504
01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:55.098
Do you remember exactly

1505
01:11:55.185 --> 01:11:56.665
what you were saying to her?

1506
01:11:56.752 --> 01:11:58.101
- Are you sure?

1507
01:11:58.188 --> 01:11:59.102
Is it okay to talk about this. really?

1508
01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:00.843
I don't know if you know this. but.

1509
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:02.627
she had a miscarriage.

1510
01:12:02.714 --> 01:12:04.238
- Yes.

1511
01:12:04.368 --> 01:12:05.326
Jason didn't
mention that to you?

1512
01:12:05.456 --> 01:12:06.892
No he didn't.

1513
01:12:06.979 --> 01:12:08.329
No. no. but we're just sort
of walking through events.

1514
01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:10.026
So if it didn't come up with him. you know.

1515
01:12:10.157 --> 01:12:11.854
it wasn't a thing that would
have walked me through.

1516
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:13.595
- Right.

1517
01:12:13.725 --> 01:12:15.118
And what
did you talk about at dinner?

1518
01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:17.686
- Normally. it's served
single serving platters.

1519
01:12:17.773 --> 01:12:18.556
as opposed to

1520
01:12:20.732 --> 01:12:21.733
Ponderosa style.

1521
01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.562
- Families.
- That's true.

1522
01:12:24.693 --> 01:12:25.868
- He's not wrong.
- He's not wrong.

1523
01:12:25.998 --> 01:12:27.130
- We criticize
each other's meals.

1524
01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.176
It's kind of a friendly
competition thing.

1525
01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.091
You can only find out so
much on Wikipedia. right?

1526
01:12:31.178 --> 01:12:32.875
So that's where we were.
- Wow.

1527
01:12:33.005 --> 01:12:33.832
- It was all in
good fun. you know.

1528
01:12:33.963 --> 01:12:35.443
Just teasing each other.

1529
01:12:35.573 --> 01:12:40.187
- I still think it's crazy
that the two of you dated.

1530
01:12:40.317 --> 01:12:41.971
- Jennifer. for whatever reason.

1531
01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:46.410
loves the story about the not
date that Jason and I had.

1532
01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:48.891
- It was the most awkward kiss.

1533
01:12:48.978 --> 01:12:50.936
It was gross. actually.

1534
01:12:51.023 --> 01:12:52.416
- It was gross?
- Yes. it was.

1535
01:12:52.547 --> 01:12:54.157
- Oh. thanks.

1536
01:12:54.244 --> 01:12:54.897
And after
dinner. we played croquet.

1537
01:12:54.984 --> 01:12:56.551
It was fun. but Elliot.

1538
01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:58.161
he ate too much watermelon.
- Okay.

1539
01:12:59.554 --> 01:13:01.382
Ah. fuck it.

1540
01:13:01.469 --> 01:13:02.339
I always bring a watermelon.

1541
01:13:02.426 --> 01:13:04.820
It's a special treat.
- Yeah. great.

1542
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:05.908
- Don't do that all the time.

1543
01:13:06.038 --> 01:13:07.736
- And then we went back
inside to play a game.

1544
01:13:07.866 --> 01:13:09.346
Favorite smell.

1545
01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:11.566
My answers are never straightforward.

1546
01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.089
which Jason knows.

1547
01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:13.916
So Sammy knew more about you

1548
01:13:14.003 --> 01:13:15.222
than Jennifer knew about you?

1549
01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:17.398
- In this particular
instance. yes.

1550
01:13:17.485 --> 01:13:19.487
And so how
did Jennifer feel about that?

1551
01:13:20.792 --> 01:13:22.142
- She didn't like that.

1552
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:23.447
Kind of highlighted that we haven't

1553
01:13:23.578 --> 01:13:24.883
been spending a lot of time together

1554
01:13:25.014 --> 01:13:26.058
and it made her feel uncomfortable

1555
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:29.410
and suspicious and jealous.
- Okay.

1556
01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.889
- It got weird.

1557
01:13:30.976 --> 01:13:32.413
- Yeah. time to go.

1558
01:13:32.543 --> 01:13:33.370
So. she stormed in the house

1559
01:13:33.457 --> 01:13:33.979
and went up to the bedroom?

1560
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.329
- She was packing.

1561
01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:37.113
We had a fight.

1562
01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:38.810
You're the scientist that
they plucked from obscurity

1563
01:13:38.941 --> 01:13:40.029
to fix everything.

1564
01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.683
- But I can and I will and I-

1565
01:13:41.813 --> 01:13:44.033
- I don't want you
to save this world.

1566
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.601
My world is lonely and sad and useless.

1567
01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:49.081
- Get away from me!

1568
01:13:49.169 --> 01:13:52.041
- She asked me if
anything had happened

1569
01:13:52.172 --> 01:13:52.824
between me and Sam.

1570
01:13:52.955 --> 01:13:54.217
We had sex one time-

1571
01:13:54.304 --> 01:13:55.000
- Fuck you.

1572
01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.437
- And I told her the truth.

1573
01:13:56.524 --> 01:13:58.265
It was a stupid mistake.

1574
01:13:58.352 --> 01:14:00.136
And if you want to make it all
about that. then go for it.

1575
01:14:00.267 --> 01:14:02.007
- I don't understand the point!

1576
01:14:02.094 --> 01:14:03.139
I don't understand how you could do this!

1577
01:14:03.226 --> 01:14:04.749
- You betrayed me first!

1578
01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.664
You gave up on this marriage!

1579
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:08.753
You gave up on this friendship!

1580
01:14:08.884 --> 01:14:10.494
You gave up on this whole thing!

1581
01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:12.017
- I hate you.

1582
01:14:12.844 --> 01:14:14.455
- Yeah. that's obvious.

1583
01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:16.065
You've hated me for a very long time.

1584
01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.719
- If you made mistakes
in that fight.

1585
01:14:17.849 --> 01:14:19.416
if you said things you
wish you hadn't said.

1586
01:14:19.503 --> 01:14:22.071
you gotta do it all like that. okay?

1587
01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.203
- That's-
- You can't fix it.

1588
01:14:24.508 --> 01:14:25.509
So if you feel like you've fucked up-

1589
01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.032
- That sucks.
- No. it does.

1590
01:14:27.119 --> 01:14:29.905
I know. but it's important
that it stays there. okay.

1591
01:14:31.123 --> 01:14:32.908
How long was she in there?

1592
01:14:33.038 --> 01:14:35.345
Not long. maybe 30 seconds.

1593
01:14:35.476 --> 01:14:36.607
And then she stormed down the stairs

1594
01:14:36.694 --> 01:14:38.348
and that was the last time I saw her.

1595
01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:40.829
- And then I got this call.

1596
01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:42.134
- Get the team together

1597
01:14:42.265 --> 01:14:44.920
and meet me at the office in 45 minutes.

1598
01:14:46.313 --> 01:14:47.793
I figured it out. Frank. I-

1599
01:14:49.882 --> 01:14:51.406
- Here we are.

1600
01:14:51.536 --> 01:14:52.711
- The next thing
that's going to happen

1601
01:14:52.798 --> 01:14:54.539
is we're going to wake Jennifer up.

1602
01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:56.062
Jason and I are going to be there.

1603
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:58.282
And based on her reaction.

1604
01:14:58.413 --> 01:15:00.153
I'm going to decide

1605
01:15:00.284 --> 01:15:02.373
whether or not we actually
go ahead with this. okay?

1606
01:15:02.504 --> 01:15:04.375
If we go ahead. you're
going to be contacted.

1607
01:15:07.073 --> 01:15:09.815
So what we have been doing

1608
01:15:09.902 --> 01:15:12.427
and what you have been
experiencing for the last two days

1609
01:15:14.124 --> 01:15:18.041
is a reconstruction of
those days that you lost.

1610
01:15:18.128 --> 01:15:21.914
And we did that because our hope

1611
01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:24.569
is that by moving you through that again.

1612
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.397
you would come to the same discovery.

1613
01:15:26.528 --> 01:15:28.138
You would have that epiphany.
- Stop.

1614
01:15:28.269 --> 01:15:29.139
And you would to remember.
- Stop.

1615
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.184
- That didn't happen. okay?
- Stop.

1616
01:15:31.315 --> 01:15:31.968
- Yeah.

1617
01:15:40.324 --> 01:15:41.499
- So you sent me here

1618
01:15:43.893 --> 01:15:44.850
to put on a play?

1619
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:48.941
That's what you're telling me?

1620
01:15:49.072 --> 01:15:51.292
That none of this was real?

1621
01:15:51.379 --> 01:15:54.295
That 15 minutes ago didn't happen?

1622
01:15:55.948 --> 01:15:56.645
That...

1623
01:15:58.951 --> 01:16:00.605
You recreated this?

1624
01:16:00.736 --> 01:16:02.303
- We didn't have a choice.

1625
01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:04.522
You didn't have a choice?

1626
01:16:04.609 --> 01:16:06.350
- We wanted you to
have the same thought

1627
01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:09.353
and we wanted that to happen
as organically as possible.

1628
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.137
- How am I supposed to get
this out of my fucking head.

1629
01:16:11.224 --> 01:16:12.269
what just happened to me?

1630
01:16:12.356 --> 01:16:13.966
- It's okay. it's okay.

1631
01:16:14.053 --> 01:16:16.229
You don't have to do
anything right now. okay?

1632
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.231
So can I tell you one more thing?

1633
01:16:18.362 --> 01:16:19.972
- I don't care what
you want me to know.

1634
01:16:20.059 --> 01:16:21.931
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.

1635
01:16:22.018 --> 01:16:23.541
This is so fucked up.

1636
01:16:23.628 --> 01:16:25.935
You have no idea how fucked up this is.

1637
01:16:26.022 --> 01:16:27.502
- No-

1638
01:16:27.632 --> 01:16:28.024
- I don't
know what's in my head!

1639
01:16:28.111 --> 01:16:28.851
- I know. you don't.

1640
01:16:28.938 --> 01:16:30.026
I know you don't.

1641
01:16:30.156 --> 01:16:31.462
But it is in there

1642
01:16:31.593 --> 01:16:32.202
and we're going to help you get it out.

1643
01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:33.899
- So what now?

1644
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:35.292
- This is what we're
going to figure out. okay?

1645
01:16:35.423 --> 01:16:36.859
We are not going to do it right now.

1646
01:16:36.989 --> 01:16:39.818
- You can take some time.

1647
01:16:39.949 --> 01:16:41.516
Process all this.

1648
01:16:43.169 --> 01:16:44.345
- You want to help me?

1649
01:16:45.171 --> 01:16:46.434
- Yep.

1650
01:16:46.564 --> 01:16:47.957
I do.

1651
01:16:48.044 --> 01:16:49.262
- If you wanted to help me.

1652
01:16:49.393 --> 01:16:51.656
you would have said
something in the first place.

1653
01:16:51.787 --> 01:16:53.179
If you wanted to help me.

1654
01:16:53.266 --> 01:16:54.355
you wouldn't have done...

1655
01:16:56.661 --> 01:16:58.924
All of you can go fuck yourselves.

1656
01:17:52.021 --> 01:17:53.457
- Okay. so I just
got off the phone

1657
01:17:53.588 --> 01:17:55.198
with the best hypnotherapy
therapist around

1658
01:17:55.328 --> 01:17:56.939
and she can be here in the morning.

1659
01:17:57.069 --> 01:17:59.158
I think that is probably our
best bet now to go that route.

1660
01:18:01.073 --> 01:18:03.859
- Hypnotherapy has been known
to implant false information.

1661
01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:04.729
I can't trust it.

1662
01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.078
- No. that's not going to happen

1663
01:18:06.165 --> 01:18:07.558
with the hypnotherapy
therapist that I've got

1664
01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:10.082
but I feel like you probably
have another idea. right?

1665
01:18:10.213 --> 01:18:12.650
So what's your plan?

1666
01:18:18.177 --> 01:18:19.614
Cytidol.

1667
01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:21.877
- What?

1668
01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:22.660
What is that?

1669
01:18:24.357 --> 01:18:25.750
- You wouldn't know.
it's classified.

1670
01:18:25.837 --> 01:18:28.884
but it's been known to
work in 90% of cases.

1671
01:18:32.496 --> 01:18:34.324
- So. what have we been doing?

1672
01:18:34.411 --> 01:18:36.761
Why'd you bring me here. 90%?

1673
01:18:36.892 --> 01:18:38.850
Why didn't you just do
that in the first place?

1674
01:18:38.937 --> 01:18:41.810
- Because 75% of
cases end up catatonic

1675
01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.899
after successful extraction.

1676
01:18:46.728 --> 01:18:48.381
- So what happens if
you're not successful?

1677
01:18:48.512 --> 01:18:51.384
And then also now. Jennifer's catatonic?

1678
01:18:51.472 --> 01:18:54.518
So you've just taken
the most important brain

1679
01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:55.563
on the whole planet right now.

1680
01:18:55.693 --> 01:18:57.086
And you've destroyed it.

1681
01:18:57.216 --> 01:18:59.044
- There's something else.

1682
01:18:59.175 --> 01:19:02.395
We've told everyone. they have five years.

1683
01:19:02.526 --> 01:19:05.181
The truth is. it's less than that.

1684
01:19:06.748 --> 01:19:07.662
A lot less.

1685
01:19:13.537 --> 01:19:15.321
- Jesus Christ.

1686
01:19:39.563 --> 01:19:41.217
- Yeah. I understand.

1687
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:45.177
I don't know.

1688
01:19:48.093 --> 01:19:49.094
No. I don't know.

1689
01:19:54.143 --> 01:19:54.665
How long?

1690
01:19:57.059 --> 01:19:58.408
Uh. I'm going to call you back.

1691
01:20:00.236 --> 01:20:01.193
- Hi.
- Hey.

1692
01:20:02.804 --> 01:20:04.283
Can I come in?
- Yeah.

1693
01:20:15.773 --> 01:20:17.558
- So how long have
we known each other?

1694
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:20.386
- Almost two years.

1695
01:20:20.473 --> 01:20:22.301
- Well. after
getting to know you

1696
01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:24.739
over the last couple years.

1697
01:20:27.393 --> 01:20:30.396
I realized that you

1698
01:20:30.483 --> 01:20:32.790
never ask anyone to do anything

1699
01:20:34.879 --> 01:20:36.664
outside of their comfort zone.

1700
01:20:36.751 --> 01:20:40.058
unless you think it's really necessary.

1701
01:20:40.145 --> 01:20:42.408
And while what you did
to me was fucked up.

1702
01:20:44.628 --> 01:20:45.673
I recognize that you thought

1703
01:20:45.803 --> 01:20:47.152
it was absolutely necessary. so.

1704
01:20:50.155 --> 01:20:50.808
I'm here.

1705
01:20:53.419 --> 01:20:54.464
And I want to help you.

1706
01:20:54.595 --> 01:20:55.596
I want to do whatever

1707
01:20:56.901 --> 01:20:58.163
it is you need me to do.

1708
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:04.343
- Well. we have to go
to the next option.

1709
01:21:06.868 --> 01:21:07.477
- Which is?

1710
01:21:09.522 --> 01:21:13.657
- There is a drug
that's classified.

1711
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:16.355
It's called Cytidol.

1712
01:21:30.935 --> 01:21:31.632
- Okay.

1713
01:21:37.463 --> 01:21:38.639
What happens if I say no?

1714
01:21:43.252 --> 01:21:43.992
- You can't.

1715
01:21:47.125 --> 01:21:47.822
- Frank.

1716
01:21:49.345 --> 01:21:52.522
- You have information
locked in your brain

1717
01:21:53.697 --> 01:21:55.481
that could save the human race.

1718
01:21:56.744 --> 01:21:59.355
If we don't get it in 18
months. we're all gone.

1719
01:22:04.882 --> 01:22:06.405
- When is this
supposed to happen?

1720
01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:12.629
- They authorized me
to give you 24 hours

1721
01:22:12.716 --> 01:22:14.152
to get your affairs in order.

1722
01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:24.336
- 24 hours?

1723
01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:32.910
Thank you.

1724
01:22:51.015 --> 01:22:51.712
- Hey.

1725
01:22:56.238 --> 01:22:57.892
So what are you going to do?

1726
01:23:00.546 --> 01:23:02.548
I don't know.

1727
01:23:03.811 --> 01:23:06.074
I think you do.

1728
01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:09.251
- I feel like I haven't
been home in 20 years.

1729
01:23:11.253 --> 01:23:12.254
- Yeah. me too.

1730
01:23:18.129 --> 01:23:19.914
- Actually. that's not
true 'cause I feel like

1731
01:23:21.785 --> 01:23:22.873
work is my home.

1732
01:23:26.485 --> 01:23:27.573
- Hmm hmm.

1733
01:23:32.665 --> 01:23:34.972
- And the one constant
thing about that has been.

1734
01:23:37.235 --> 01:23:37.758
um...

1735
01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:43.111
You.

1736
01:23:46.984 --> 01:23:49.595
I need you to promise me

1737
01:23:49.682 --> 01:23:52.337
that you are going to go off and be happy

1738
01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:55.558
with your wife and your new baby.

1739
01:23:55.688 --> 01:23:58.648
And live a very happy life
because you owe that to me.

1740
01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:10.355
You're not promising.

1741
01:24:10.442 --> 01:24:11.661
- I promise.

1742
01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:12.444
- Thank you.

1743
01:24:18.973 --> 01:24:19.800
I have to go.

1744
01:24:23.847 --> 01:24:25.457
I want you to finish up.

1745
01:24:28.634 --> 01:24:29.853
Don't fuck it up.

1746
01:25:12.157 --> 01:25:13.724
- I don't want to bother
telling you how ashamed I am

1747
01:25:13.811 --> 01:25:15.508
because I think that's really obvious.

1748
01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.513
And this might be the weirdest thing to say

1749
01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.907
but this had nothing to do with you.

1750
01:25:26.171 --> 01:25:27.999
I've just been alone
for a really long time.

1751
01:25:29.783 --> 01:25:31.394
It's no excuse. but it's the truth.

1752
01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:35.528
I can see how you were lonely.

1753
01:25:36.921 --> 01:25:40.446
And I can see how Jason was lonely.

1754
01:25:42.796 --> 01:25:44.886
- The worst part about this is.

1755
01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.409
I think I betrayed you the most

1756
01:25:48.672 --> 01:25:52.458
and I wouldn't dream of
asking you to forgive me.

1757
01:25:52.545 --> 01:25:54.330
More than anything.

1758
01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:55.461
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive him.

1759
01:25:57.724 --> 01:25:59.683
You're his whole world.

1760
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:01.467
He loves you more than anything.

1761
01:26:03.774 --> 01:26:05.732
- I think the thing that
has come out of all of this

1762
01:26:05.819 --> 01:26:07.169
is that I realized

1763
01:26:07.256 --> 01:26:09.388
that there are so many
different ways to love.

1764
01:26:10.563 --> 01:26:11.956
You have hope.

1765
01:26:14.916 --> 01:26:15.960
With or without me.

1766
01:26:17.353 --> 01:26:19.137
Just know that I want you to be happy.

1767
01:26:21.835 --> 01:26:23.446
And I'll see you on the other side.

1768
01:26:29.539 --> 01:26:31.280
I miss you already.

1769
01:26:49.428 --> 01:26:50.168
Hi.

1770
01:26:51.256 --> 01:26:51.953
- Hey.

1771
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:02.964
They told me.

1772
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:06.358
they told me I couldn't call you.

1773
01:27:06.445 --> 01:27:08.621
So I didn't call.

1774
01:27:08.752 --> 01:27:09.361
- I know.

1775
01:27:18.588 --> 01:27:19.632
- I'm...

1776
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:24.986
I'm really sorry about

1777
01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:27.727
all of this.

1778
01:27:29.425 --> 01:27:30.165
- I know.

1779
01:27:34.778 --> 01:27:35.997
I don't have a lot of time.

1780
01:27:43.874 --> 01:27:45.571
Last year when I was in the hospital.

1781
01:27:46.877 --> 01:27:49.662
when I called you

1782
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.145
and I told you that I
had had a miscarriage.

1783
01:27:56.321 --> 01:27:57.192
I was...

1784
01:28:02.066 --> 01:28:05.548
I didn't have a miscarriage. Jason.

1785
01:28:09.334 --> 01:28:11.597
We didn't have a miscarriage.

1786
01:28:22.043 --> 01:28:24.610
I had to make a choice.

1787
01:28:26.873 --> 01:28:27.831
I couldn't do both.

1788
01:28:27.918 --> 01:28:29.398
I couldn't be a mother

1789
01:28:31.008 --> 01:28:33.750
and then do what I was expected to do.

1790
01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.754
So I made a choice
and I chose and I...

1791
01:28:37.884 --> 01:28:38.537
And I'm sorry.

1792
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:48.286
Please.

1793
01:29:06.522 --> 01:29:07.175
No.

1794
01:29:12.745 --> 01:29:13.442
- You...

1795
01:29:15.705 --> 01:29:16.662
- I remember.

1796
01:29:18.795 --> 01:29:19.796
- Jenn.

1797
01:29:20.797 --> 01:29:22.973
Jenn. you have to go.

1798
01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:24.801
- No. no. no. no.
I'm not leaving.

1799
01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:29.675
- I'll follow you.
