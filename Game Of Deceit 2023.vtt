00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.896
♪ Oh. I'll make you better

4
00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:29.000
I don't do this a lot.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.275
Neither do I.

6
00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:36.620
So. have you been
doing all right?

7
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.896
I'm sorry. that was
a silly question.

8
00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:38.758
Of course not.

9
00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:40.379
No. it's okay.

10
00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:43.655
I've been fine. all
things considered.

11
00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.551
Of course. it's hard with
two daughters. and...

12
00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.344
I still miss him.

13
00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:54.068
It still feels like a
dream that he's dead.

14
00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:55.620
You probably don't
wanna talk about this now.

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.448
It's actually kind of
nice to talk about it.

16
00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:02.034
It's been over a year. and
no one even says his name.

17
00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:03.655
So...

18
00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.310
Wish I knew him
better. you know?

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.827
I wish I got to know you better.

20
00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:09.620
I mean. we barely spoke
in high school. right?

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.068
Yeah.

22
00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:12.551
Crazy how we bumped
into each other.

23
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.620
Well. you two probably
would've been friends.

24
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.137
Mm.

25
00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:17.724
Yeah. he was a
really great guy.

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.137
An amazing husband.
a wonderful father.

27
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.379
Wow.

28
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:33.172
You know. my mom
died a few years ago.

29
00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.655
my father before that. so I
know what you're going through.

30
00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:41.310
Yeah.

31
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.862
This is probably
a heavy conversation

32
00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:44.103
for a first date. right?

33
00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:47.103

church on Sunday. right?

Are you okay if the girls

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:22.793
Girl. I have had enough.

Nope.

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:46.827
Ian. I have had enough.

73
00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:48.965
I'm done.

74
00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.206
Maya. I'm not the only
one who's fallen apart.

75
00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:52.724
You've fallen apart too.

76
00:03:52.724 --> 00:03:54.448
You've struggled and
I've helped you. baby.

77
00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:55.724
I've helped you get through it.

78
00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:56.793
Are you gonna
go there with me?

79
00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:01.034
I was depressed because
I lost my husband.

80
00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:02.862
but I got my life together.

81
00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:05.827
You. on the other hand.
can't seem to do that.

82
00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:06.827
Baby. all right.
look. look. look.

83
00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:09.000
I just need a little
more time. okay?

84
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.172
I'll go to the program.

85
00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:11.000
I'll go get help. baby.

86
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.068
I want to be better.

87
00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:13.517
I just need a little more time.

88
00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:16.172
I told you I am done.

89
00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.586
What part don't you understand?

90
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.896
Baby. look. I. I love you.

91
00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:24.103
I love you. and I
love your kids. baby.

92
00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:25.413
Look at me.

93
00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:27.965
Baby. I want to be
a real family. okay?

94
00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:31.413
There's nothing more that I
want than a real family. okay?

95
00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:32.931
I'm. I'm going to
go to the program.

96
00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:33.896
I'm going to get help.

97
00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:34.655
Baby. look at me.

98
00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:37.793
One more chance. that's it.

99
00:04:37.793 --> 00:04:40.448
Ian. you have
had enough chances.

100
00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:42.724
What else do you want from me?

101
00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:45.275
How many do you
want me to give you?

102
00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:47.586
I have trust you. you
have violated my trust.

103
00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:48.620
What do you want from me?

104
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.517
Baby. just one more. okay?

105
00:04:57.344 --> 00:05:01.275
So. I was waiting
for the right moment.

106
00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:02.448
The right moment never came.

107
00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:05.724
so. you know. that's
all. that's all my fault.

108
00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:09.034
Love you so much.

109
00:05:10.482 --> 00:05:12.965
I'm sorry for everything
that I've done.

110
00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:17.000
Maya. I'll go get help. I'll
do whatever I need to do.

111
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.379
but I can't lose you.

112
00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:23.275
I can't.

113
00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:26.896
Baby. I am no good without you.

114
00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:31.655
I'm no good alone. baby.

115
00:05:33.413 --> 00:05:35.827
We've been through
so much. so much.

116
00:05:37.413 --> 00:05:39.034
Baby. please don't
give up on me now.

117
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:43.724
Please.

118
00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.724
You don't make me regret this.

119
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.620
One more chance.

120
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.586
But you have to promise me.

121
00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:03.827
promise me no more drinking
and no more gambling.

122
00:06:03.827 --> 00:06:04.793
I mean it.

123
00:06:05.827 --> 00:06:06.620
Okay.

124
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.793
I'm serious.

125
00:06:27.724 --> 00:06:29.000
Mama.

126
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.310
Mama?

127
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.379
Mama!

128
00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.724
Oh. God. baby.

129
00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:35.000
What's wrong?

130
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.517
You wouldn't wake up.

131
00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:38.724
Oh. Mommy's so sorry.

132
00:06:39.724 --> 00:06:41.034
I must have overslept again.

133
00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:44.655
Look. why don't
you head downstairs

134
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:46.620
and I'll meet you
in a minute. yeah?

135
00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:48.724
Can I have a kiss?

136
00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:53.896
You got on my favorite PJs.

137
00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:00.551
Ow.

138
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:05.068
Ow.

139
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.620
Noelle. Grace!

140
00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:16.862
Maya.

141
00:07:16.862 --> 00:07:20.068
Oh my God. Ian. you scared me.

142
00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:21.586
What are you doing home?

143
00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:22.758
I left work early.

144
00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:24.103
I decided to take a shower here.

145
00:07:24.103 --> 00:07:25.896
What. what are you doing?

146
00:07:25.896 --> 00:07:28.000
I don't know. what does
it look like I'm doing?

147
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:30.413
It looks like you've lost it.

148
00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:31.689
Funny.

149
00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:33.620
No. the nanny starts today.

150
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.620
so I figured a little extra
security couldn't hurt.

151
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.655
You know. since Mama's going
back to work full time.

152
00:07:39.655 --> 00:07:41.620
she needs to keep an
eye on her babies.

153
00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:45.793
I get that. but. baby.
you worry too much.

154
00:07:45.793 --> 00:07:47.655
All right?

155
00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:49.482
Come on now. you stay with
a cop. you live with a cop.

156
00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:51.896
Not to mention the sexiest
cop in the district.

157
00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:54.206
Oh my God.

158
00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:55.586
I'm all the security you need.

159
00:07:55.586 --> 00:07:57.310
Girl. what do you
think she's gonna pull?

160
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.482
Well. first of all. she
was the only nanny available.

161
00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:01.206
so that's telling you a lot.

162
00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:05.103
And I've never left a
stranger with the kids before.

163
00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:06.620
Right. I get that.

164
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.379
but you're still
worrying too much.

165
00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:11.344
And that looks a little creepy.

166
00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:12.965
That doesn't look creepy.

167
00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:14.448
Baby. that. that's
a little creepy.

168
00:08:14.448 --> 00:08:16.103
Can you take it down. please?

169
00:08:16.103 --> 00:08:17.206
Fine.

170
00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:18.000
Thanks.

171
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.551
God.

172
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:29.000
Look. I'm. I'm gonna
go change. okay?

173
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.206
All right.

174
00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:31.724
And promise me one thing?

175
00:08:31.724 --> 00:08:33.517
No more weird stuff. at
least while I'm gone.

176
00:08:33.517 --> 00:08:34.688
It wasn't weird.

177
00:08:34.688 --> 00:08:35.758
No. that was pretty weird.

178
00:08:37.136 --> 00:08:39.413
My wife.

179
00:08:39.413 --> 00:08:40.586
I'll be back.

180
00:09:35.827 --> 00:09:38.689
Hey. and here is the kitchen.

181
00:09:38.689 --> 00:09:40.758
Oh. nice.

182
00:09:40.758 --> 00:09:44.275
And here we have
Noelle. and this is Grace.

183
00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:46.206
Hi. girls.

184
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.827
Hey. Ian.

185
00:09:50.827 --> 00:09:52.172
Ian. this is Elle.

186
00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:53.206
Elle. Ian.

187
00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:54.241
The new babysitter.

188
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:55.344
Hi. nice to meet you.

189
00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.655
Nice to meet you.

190
00:09:56.655 --> 00:09:57.758
Have we met before?

191
00:09:57.758 --> 00:09:59.586
I mean. you look familiar.

192
00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:01.517
I don't think we've met.

193
00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.275
but Maya gave me
the full rundown.

194
00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:05.379
You have a beautiful home.

195
00:10:06.517 --> 00:10:07.310
Thank you.

196
00:10:08.827 --> 00:10:10.862
What's their usual
bedtime routine?

197
00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:12.551
Anything you want me to do?

198
00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:14.103
We don't usually
start bedtime stuff

199
00:10:14.103 --> 00:10:16.862
for another hour or
two. but if you want.

200
00:10:16.862 --> 00:10:18.275
you can go with the
girls to their room

201
00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:20.379
and you guys can get
to know each other.

202
00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:21.827
- Okay.
- Yeah?

203
00:10:21.827 --> 00:10:22.931
All right. girls.
what do you say?

204
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:23.724
You wanna show me your room?

205
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:25.275
Yeah.

206
00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:27.206
Noelle and Grace.
such beautiful names.

207
00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:28.000
All right.

208
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.724
How's your day?

209
00:10:32.724 --> 00:10:35.379
Oh. don't you mean
how was my morning?

210
00:10:37.034 --> 00:10:39.034
I've been so exhausted lately

211
00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:40.827
that I slept through a
meeting with the principal.

212
00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:42.379
Maybe you shouldn't go in now.

213
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.172
Honey.

214
00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:47.413
Look. we agreed that when
the girls were of age.

215
00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.896
I would go back to work.

216
00:10:49.896 --> 00:10:52.103
You said that you
were okay with that.

217
00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:53.482
I know. baby.

218
00:10:53.482 --> 00:10:55.172
but sometimes I think you put
too much pressure on yourself.

219
00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.068
You just need to take
it one day at a time.

220
00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:00.896
Maybe you're right.

221
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.379
How's work going?

222
00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:04.793
Mm.

223
00:11:04.793 --> 00:11:06.793
I talked to the Chief today.

224
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:09.827
And?

225
00:11:09.827 --> 00:11:12.724
And they are promoting
your boy to Lieutenant.

226
00:11:12.724 --> 00:11:15.896
Finally.

227
00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:19.724
Oh. baby.

228
00:11:19.724 --> 00:11:21.241
You know. it's
not settled yet.

229
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:23.000
They still have to push
through some paperwork

230
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.241
and everything. but
it's safe to say

231
00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:28.000
that I will be on my best
behavior for the next few weeks.

232
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.724
Well. you have
nothing to worry about.

233
00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:32.517
Oh. boy.

234
00:11:32.517 --> 00:11:35.310
Well. I guess we gotta have
something a little fancier

235
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.689
than nuggets to celebrate
that big promotion.

236
00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:41.068
And I could think of
one way to celebrate.

237
00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:46.793
That's right. I have the
perfect present in mind.

238
00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:47.793
A little prince.

239
00:11:49.344 --> 00:11:50.931
A son to carry my name.

240
00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:53.862
Baby. I told you I
am done with diapers.

241
00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:56.137
I have a career that I love
that I wanna get back to.

242
00:11:56.137 --> 00:11:59.034
and here you are trying to
keep me barefoot and pregnant?

243
00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:01.310
Would you stop it?

244
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.310
Call me Lieutenant.

245
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.793
No. no. no. no.

246
00:12:06.068 --> 00:12:08.103
Have you been drinking?

247
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.827
Oh. gosh.

248
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.931
Come on. baby.

249
00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:14.758
it was just one drink with
the guys to celebrate.

250
00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:17.000
And look. now it's our
turn to celebrate. okay?

251
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.655
No.

252
00:12:17.655 --> 00:12:18.724
- Just one drink.
- No.

253
00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:19.965
- Just one.
- No. Ian.

254
00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:22.862
We know how this thing
goes. it's a cycle.

255
00:12:22.862 --> 00:12:24.965
One drink goes to the
next. goes to the next.

256
00:12:24.965 --> 00:12:27.000
and here we are
back at square one.

257
00:12:28.068 --> 00:12:30.413
Baby. you have a big
promotion on the line.

258
00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:31.965
You can't jeopardize it.

259
00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:36.482
Okay.

260
00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:39.344
All right. I'm. I'm sorry.

261
00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:42.517
We just have to find a
safer way to celebrate.

262
00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.034
Baby. I already told you.

263
00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:47.275
I can think of another
way we can celebrate.

264
00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:50.241
Come on.

265
00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:51.793
Please.

266
00:12:54.517 --> 00:12:56.379
Oh. baby.

267
00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.103
Baby. grab a condom.

268
00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:03.413
Ian. honey. come on.
please. grab a condom.

269
00:13:10.517 --> 00:13:12.344
You're betting again?

270
00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:17.172
Oh God. I can't believe you.

271
00:13:18.413 --> 00:13:19.793
Baby.

272
00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:24.586
♪ Baby. we both just
lit the candle ♪

273
00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:30.965
♪ Place it up. that's
when it's stable ♪

274
00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:36.344
♪ I know the stakes are high

275
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:42.206
♪ All is fair in
love and strife ♪

276
00:13:42.724 --> 00:13:44.206
♪ Come

277
00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:30.000
Oh. coffee's ready.

278
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.275
Thanks. Elle.

279
00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:36.000
Morning.

280
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.172
Good morning.

281
00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:38.965
Hey.

282
00:14:40.344 --> 00:14:42.000
I gotta make a call
with the principal.

283
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.206
I thought you slept
through that meeting.

284
00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:47.275
Mm-hmm. but he was
very understanding
and we rescheduled.

285
00:14:47.275 --> 00:14:49.137
Well. that was nice of him.

286
00:14:49.137 --> 00:14:51.931
Look. I might be late
coming home tonight.

287
00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:54.034
They have me out on
patrol all week. okay?

288
00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:55.206
All right.

289
00:14:55.206 --> 00:14:56.620
So. I'll see you later.

290
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.413
Okay. I'll see
you later. babe.

291
00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:58.620
Have a good day.

292
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.206
Oh. I can only take one cup.

293
00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:02.379
I can't be late when
I'm up for a promotion.

294
00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:03.275
A promotion?

295
00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:05.344
Well. that's wonderful.

296
00:15:05.344 --> 00:15:07.241
I'll be Lieutenant
any day now.

297
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:10.862
Well. maybe I shouldn't
get my hopes up too high

298
00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:12.344
until it's official. but...

299
00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.275
I'm sure you're gonna get it.

300
00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:16.896
Maya told me you've been at the
station for. what. 10 years?

301
00:15:16.896 --> 00:15:17.827
Right?

302
00:15:17.827 --> 00:15:19.344
Yeah.

303
00:15:19.344 --> 00:15:20.896
You're like a local hero.

304
00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:22.413
Give me too much credit. Elle.

305
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.344
I gotta get out here.

306
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:29.931
All right?

307
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:31.068
Welcome to the family.

308
00:15:37.586 --> 00:15:39.448
Grabbed your mail again.

309
00:15:39.448 --> 00:15:41.551
They really should put
the boxes further apart.

310
00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:43.000
Thank you.

311
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.344
So you have company over?

312
00:15:45.896 --> 00:15:48.827
Yeah. new nanny.
my wife's idea.

313
00:15:48.827 --> 00:15:51.241
Quite the looker. for a nanny.

314
00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:55.172
Have a good day. Mr. Stocklan.

315
00:16:17.413 --> 00:16:21.586
The cab's on its way. so
I'm having a little pre-drink.

316
00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:23.758
Girl. of course I don't
drink in front of Ian.

317
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.379
I've got a secret bottle stashed
away for special occasions.

318
00:16:32.724 --> 00:16:34.068
All right. see you soon.

319
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.758
Who was that?

320
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:41.931
That was Megan.

321
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:43.482
Oh.

322
00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:45.413
Oh. honey. I'm
so sorry. I just-

323
00:16:45.413 --> 00:16:46.965
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. babe.

324
00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.448
Listen. I made
dinner reservations

325
00:16:48.448 --> 00:16:50.586
at your favorite
restaurant tonight.

326
00:16:50.586 --> 00:16:53.172
But. honey. I told you
I was going out tonight.

327
00:16:53.172 --> 00:16:55.655
Baby. I know. but I just
wanted to surprise you.

328
00:16:55.655 --> 00:16:58.068
Look. I'm tired of the
rift between us. all right?

329
00:16:58.068 --> 00:16:59.586
And you'd be happy to know

330
00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:01.517
that I'm meeting with my
sponsor in the morning.

331
00:17:03.344 --> 00:17:05.378
Baby. I just wanna be perfect
for you. for the family.

332
00:17:05.378 --> 00:17:07.034
Honey. that is so sweet.

333
00:17:07.034 --> 00:17:08.964
but can we do this
tomorrow night instead?

334
00:17:08.964 --> 00:17:10.862
No. baby. come on.

335
00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:12.482
Look. I just wanna spend a
little more time with you

336
00:17:12.482 --> 00:17:14.378
before you go back
to work. all right?

337
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.413
Listen. we still have
a chance. all right?

338
00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:23.137
You've been tired lately. and
baby. I never get to see you.

339
00:17:23.137 --> 00:17:25.205
So I wanna see you tonight.

340
00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:27.550
The point is. I promised
Megan that I would go.

341
00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.310
Okay. so what I'm hearing is
that you'd rather spend time

342
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.000
with your little friends than
stay home with me. right?

343
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.413
What. are you trying
to avoid me. Maya?

344
00:17:34.413 --> 00:17:36.482
I'm not trying to avoid you.

345
00:17:36.482 --> 00:17:38.000
Really?

346
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.137
We never spend
any time together.

347
00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:41.310
No. because every time we do.

348
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.965
all you wanna talk
about is having a son.

349
00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:45.965
Honey. I have told
you a million times

350
00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:48.206
that I don't want another baby.

351
00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:50.379
especially not with
someone who keeps on lying

352
00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:51.827
about their drinking
and gambling.

353
00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:54.482
Look. Ian. you are an addict.

354
00:17:54.482 --> 00:17:56.310
So what you're saying is
you'll have another child.

355
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.310
just not by me. right?

356
00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.344
Honey. that's not
what I'm saying.

357
00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:03.206
I'm trying to say that I don't
want another kid. period.

358
00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:05.068
But what about me. Maya?

359
00:18:05.068 --> 00:18:06.310
Huh?

360
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.724
Why do I never get a say?

361
00:18:07.724 --> 00:18:09.275
You're always telling
me what to do.

362
00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:10.758
but you never listen
to what I want.

363
00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:13.448
Ian. I am not trying
to tell you what to do.

364
00:18:13.448 --> 00:18:15.413
I'm just asking you
to stop drinking

365
00:18:15.413 --> 00:18:18.241
and gambling our savings away.

366
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:20.310
And if you think that's
me being controlling.

367
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.758
then I'm sorry to say it.
babe. but you're delusional.

368
00:18:23.758 --> 00:18:26.517
You don't get to
speak to me like that.

369
00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:27.862
Calm down.

370
00:18:27.862 --> 00:18:29.517
I'm going out.

371
00:18:29.517 --> 00:18:30.413
Let me!

372
00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:32.068
I'm your husband.

373
00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:34.586
You don't get to just walk out.

374
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:37.448
Ian.

375
00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:42.137
We can talk about this tomorrow.

376
00:18:42.137 --> 00:18:42.931
Please.

377
00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:48.413
You know what?

378
00:18:48.413 --> 00:18:49.241
Fine.

379
00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:53.172
Do what you want.

380
00:18:57.586 --> 00:18:58.413
Oh.

381
00:20:01.655 --> 00:20:02.482
Oh. baby.

382
00:20:04.896 --> 00:20:07.482
Looks like your friends
are gonna miss you tonight.

383
00:20:27.758 --> 00:20:28.655
Oh my God.

384
00:23:19.344 --> 00:23:21.344
All right. what happened?

385
00:23:21.344 --> 00:23:23.172
Man. I left my
phone in the office.

386
00:23:23.172 --> 00:23:24.965
Gotta go back inside.

387
00:23:24.965 --> 00:23:26.551
All right.

388
00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:27.344
I'll wait for you. huh?

389
00:23:27.344 --> 00:23:28.896
All right.

390
00:23:38.827 --> 00:23:41.344
Hey. I'm Liz. Deputy Chief.

391
00:23:41.344 --> 00:23:42.758
Hi.

392
00:23:42.758 --> 00:23:44.379
Do you need help
with something?

393
00:23:44.379 --> 00:23:46.206
I was hoping that
someone can help me out

394
00:23:46.206 --> 00:23:49.241
with this situation that I-

395
00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:50.000
Maya.

396
00:23:51.241 --> 00:23:52.034
Hey.

397
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.793
Hey. baby.

398
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:02.034
What are you doing here?

399
00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:05.413
I thought you were
on patrol today.

400
00:24:05.413 --> 00:24:07.241
I was. but I
left my phone here.

401
00:24:09.103 --> 00:24:10.137
I'm sorry.

402
00:24:10.137 --> 00:24:13.068
I know how much you hate
being a traffic cop.

403
00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:17.862
Oh. I know you've
been forgetting your lunch

404
00:24:18.448 --> 00:24:19.896
a lot lately.

405
00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:22.620
so I decided I would bring
you something just in case.

406
00:24:24.517 --> 00:24:25.724
Thank you. baby.

407
00:24:25.724 --> 00:24:27.689
Okay. I'm gonna leave.

408
00:24:27.689 --> 00:24:29.206
Wait. wait. wait.

409
00:24:29.206 --> 00:24:30.482
Are you sure you're doing okay?

410
00:24:30.482 --> 00:24:32.000
Yes. honey. I'm fine.

411
00:24:34.862 --> 00:24:36.000
Wait here.

412
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:44.931
It's nice to meet you.

413
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.931
Ian talks very highly of you.

414
00:24:48.931 --> 00:24:50.068
Thanks.

415
00:24:51.724 --> 00:24:54.172
That's sweet of you.
bringing him his lunch.

416
00:24:56.241 --> 00:24:57.206
It's no big deal.

417
00:24:57.206 --> 00:24:58.517
Yeah.

418
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.103
My phone number.

419
00:25:05.482 --> 00:25:07.586
In case you ever need it.

420
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:12.586
Are you sure you're all right?

421
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.448
Baby. I'm just going to
go ahead and take you home.

422
00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.655
Chief said it's all good.

423
00:25:17.655 --> 00:25:18.931
He's gonna send
someone else out.

424
00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:20.758
Honey. I told you
that's not necessary.

425
00:25:20.758 --> 00:25:22.448
I'm just going
over to the store.

426
00:25:22.448 --> 00:25:24.655
Baby. it's no big
deal. all right?

427
00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:26.931
Besides. that's for the best.

428
00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:29.586
You look a little tired anyway.

429
00:25:31.275 --> 00:25:32.862
I'm gonna go change. all right?

430
00:25:32.862 --> 00:25:34.517
Chief'll keep you company.

431
00:25:34.517 --> 00:25:35.931
His daughter's in
the music class.

432
00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:45.655
What you over there doing?

433
00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:46.965
You reading?

434
00:25:46.965 --> 00:25:47.758
Yeah.

435
00:25:58.931 --> 00:26:01.344
Was there something else
you wanted to show me?

436
00:26:01.344 --> 00:26:02.310
Come. come.

437
00:26:03.965 --> 00:26:06.206
Oh. okay you want me
to see something else?

438
00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:07.379
Let's go. all right.

439
00:26:10.448 --> 00:26:13.517
Oh. what do you want me to see?

440
00:26:13.517 --> 00:26:15.551
Can we play with my dolls?

441
00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:16.758
Your dolls?

442
00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:19.172
Of course we can
play with your dolls.

443
00:26:19.172 --> 00:26:20.275
Is that your doll house?

444
00:26:20.275 --> 00:26:21.034
Yeah.

445
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.310
Show me how you like
to play with your dolls.

446
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.275
All right. I'll be right
back. sweetheart. okay?

447
00:26:34.275 --> 00:26:35.827
- Okay.
- Okay.

448
00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:37.172
Stay right here. okay?

449
00:27:13.896 --> 00:27:15.068
What about your car?

450
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.896
I'll bike in tomorrow
and pick it up.

451
00:27:21.103 --> 00:27:22.827
What were you doing there. Maya?

452
00:27:24.448 --> 00:27:26.448
Can't a wife do something
nice for her husband?

453
00:27:42.448 --> 00:27:44.068
No. seriously. what do
you think you were doing.

454
00:27:44.068 --> 00:27:45.827
just showing up at
my work like that?

455
00:27:48.137 --> 00:27:51.034
You know. I've just been
anxious lately and I missed you.

456
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.241
You know. sometimes
you forget your lunch.

457
00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:57.206
so I figured I'd bring
something by the station.

458
00:27:58.655 --> 00:28:01.103
Elle's home with the kids. so...

459
00:28:04.689 --> 00:28:06.206
Ian. I'm sorry about yesterday.

460
00:28:08.068 --> 00:28:10.379
You were right. we don't
spend enough time together.

461
00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:11.965
just the two of us.

462
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:16.793
It's okay.

463
00:28:16.793 --> 00:28:18.103
You sure that's everything?

464
00:28:19.896 --> 00:28:21.379
I talked to the principal

465
00:28:21.379 --> 00:28:24.172
and he said there
may not be a budget

466
00:28:25.724 --> 00:28:27.103
to where they can hire
me back full-time.

467
00:28:28.137 --> 00:28:29.827
In fact. they may be getting rid

468
00:28:29.827 --> 00:28:32.482
of the music program
altogether. so...

469
00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:35.689
You know how bad I've
wanted this. Ian.

470
00:28:35.689 --> 00:28:38.000
I was just. I was upset.

471
00:28:39.827 --> 00:28:42.103
But I knew you were the
person to cheer me on.

472
00:28:46.137 --> 00:28:48.000
Baby. I'm sorry
to hear about that.

473
00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:51.551
Wait. I thought your meeting

474
00:28:51.551 --> 00:28:53.103
with the principal
was yesterday.

475
00:28:58.137 --> 00:29:02.862
Yeah. but I let
them borrow my music stand.

476
00:29:02.862 --> 00:29:04.517
so I had to go back
and pick it up.

477
00:29:10.827 --> 00:29:13.586
Would you mind stopping
at the grocery store?

478
00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:16.241
Elle said she needed a few
things for dinner tonight.

479
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:19.000
Can stop by there later.

480
00:29:19.931 --> 00:29:21.862
Don't worry about that.

481
00:29:25.206 --> 00:29:26.000
Hi.

482
00:29:27.689 --> 00:29:29.413
Hi. little lady.

483
00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:32.758
I'll be back downstairs
in a second. okay?

484
00:29:32.758 --> 00:29:33.551
What you doing?

485
00:29:36.103 --> 00:29:40.551
I'm planning a surprise
for your mommy and daddy.

486
00:29:40.551 --> 00:29:44.482
They're gonna be really happy
about it. okay?

487
00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.034
They're gonna be so happy.

488
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.482
But you have to keep
it between me and you.

489
00:29:47.482 --> 00:29:48.896
just for a little bit. okay?

490
00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:50.620
You can't tell
them I was in here.

491
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.275
A surprise?

492
00:29:53.551 --> 00:29:56.206
Yeah. like a surprise party!

493
00:29:56.206 --> 00:29:57.068
Right?

494
00:29:58.413 --> 00:30:02.586
So. this is our
little secret. okay?

495
00:30:06.206 --> 00:30:06.965
Noelle?

496
00:30:06.965 --> 00:30:09.034
Is that me?

497
00:30:09.034 --> 00:30:10.965
Can I. let me see. let
me see if that's you.

498
00:30:10.965 --> 00:30:12.379
Hold on. let. can I see it?

499
00:30:12.379 --> 00:30:13.689
Give it back. Noelle.

500
00:30:13.689 --> 00:30:14.689
Give it back.

501
00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:16.620
Noelle. let me. okay.

502
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.413
Noelle.

503
00:30:19.862 --> 00:30:21.241
This isn't funny. Noelle.

504
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:24.586
Give it back.

505
00:30:24.586 --> 00:30:26.517
Ow. you're hurting me!

506
00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:29.517
Give it back. I need it.

507
00:30:29.517 --> 00:30:30.344
I need that back.

508
00:30:35.379 --> 00:30:35.965
Come here. I'm sorry.

509
00:30:35.965 --> 00:30:37.586
Are you okay?

510
00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:38.379
You okay?

511
00:30:39.931 --> 00:30:41.379
I gotta get back to work.

512
00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:43.586
Babe. you need to rest.

513
00:30:43.586 --> 00:30:45.068
You seem a little off.

514
00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:46.137
I know. but if they
keep the program.

515
00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:47.344
I've got a lesson plan due.

516
00:30:48.862 --> 00:30:49.965
You wanna go play?

517
00:30:50.758 --> 00:30:51.793
Yeah. you do.

518
00:30:51.793 --> 00:30:53.379
Come on. let's go.

519
00:30:53.379 --> 00:30:54.620
Let's go play.

520
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.896
Remember I showed you that?

521
00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:56.896
Let's go play.

522
00:30:56.896 --> 00:30:58.172
Elle. girls.

523
00:30:59.793 --> 00:31:00.965
We need to talk.

524
00:31:00.965 --> 00:31:02.206
Ian. I am busy.

525
00:31:02.206 --> 00:31:04.172
Babe. we need to talk now.

526
00:31:04.172 --> 00:31:06.310
God. do you not
understand what busy means?

527
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.275
But you have to promise me.

528
00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:11.586
Come on. pinky promise
that you won't say anything

529
00:31:11.586 --> 00:31:12.655
to mommy or daddy.

530
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:16.241
We don't want daddy
to get mad. right?

531
00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:18.655
All right. promise.

532
00:31:18.655 --> 00:31:20.310
I promise.

533
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.137
Nice.

534
00:31:23.758 --> 00:31:24.517
What's this?

535
00:31:34.103 --> 00:31:35.620
Who did you show this to?

536
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.586
I didn't show it to anyone.

537
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.758
What is wrong with you. Maya?

538
00:31:42.758 --> 00:31:43.931
What's wrong with me?

539
00:31:45.655 --> 00:31:47.068
What happened last night. Ian?

540
00:31:48.965 --> 00:31:51.517
You wanna tell me why I've
been sleeping so much?

541
00:31:51.517 --> 00:31:55.275
Why I have no idea how I
got into the bed last night?

542
00:31:55.275 --> 00:31:58.448
I know that you put
something in my drink.

543
00:31:58.448 --> 00:32:01.172
If you show that to someone.
you will destroy our family.

544
00:32:01.172 --> 00:32:04.137
You have already
destroyed our family!

545
00:32:05.862 --> 00:32:08.172
With all of the gambling and
the drinking and now this?

546
00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:10.034
You didn't give
me a choice. Maya.

547
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:13.034
You're being selfish.

548
00:32:13.034 --> 00:32:15.310
I've adopted your kids
and what did I get. huh?

549
00:32:16.827 --> 00:32:19.689
You know how much I want a son.

550
00:32:19.689 --> 00:32:21.206
A family. baby.

551
00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:22.275
a son to be able to
pass something down to.

552
00:32:22.275 --> 00:32:24.000
just like my dad did for me.

553
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.206
That's exactly what
this world needs.

554
00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.068
Another drunk trying to
deal with his demons.

555
00:32:31.448 --> 00:32:33.379
I thought you were
different. Ian.

556
00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:38.000
What you have done to me.
what you have done to my kids?

557
00:32:38.862 --> 00:32:40.206
I just want a son.

558
00:32:42.172 --> 00:32:43.758
A perfect family. baby.

559
00:32:43.758 --> 00:32:44.517
Don't touch me.

560
00:32:52.068 --> 00:32:54.827
Hello. I'd like to
report a disturbance.

561
00:32:54.827 --> 00:32:56.206
You disgust me.

562
00:32:57.862 --> 00:32:59.689
Wait. what did you say?

563
00:32:59.689 --> 00:33:01.172
You think you're the only one

564
00:33:01.172 --> 00:33:03.000
to be able to
gather up evidence?

565
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.586
What if the wrong things ended
up in your purse or your car?

566
00:33:06.586 --> 00:33:09.827
Or maybe in your system
because of a drug-laced drink.

567
00:33:09.827 --> 00:33:11.068
Huh?

568
00:33:11.068 --> 00:33:13.413
I am going to be a lieutenant.

569
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.137
And baby. you already know
the influence that I have.

570
00:33:17.137 --> 00:33:18.586
the people that I know.

571
00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:19.896
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

572
00:33:19.896 --> 00:33:21.310
We're married. Maya.

573
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.931
And I'll have
custody of the kids

574
00:33:22.931 --> 00:33:24.413
if anything was
to happen to you.

575
00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:27.689
And then maybe then
I'll find a real woman

576
00:33:27.689 --> 00:33:30.206
who can gimme the family
that I need. that I deserve.

577
00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:32.551
Baby. if you try to run.

578
00:33:34.827 --> 00:33:35.724
I'll find you.

579
00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.551
You remember what
happened last time. right?

580
00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:41.413
Cops pulled you over

581
00:33:41.413 --> 00:33:44.206
and they brought you right
back home to me. to Daddy.

582
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.896
You know it could have ended
up very differently though.

583
00:33:49.896 --> 00:33:50.724
right?

584
00:33:52.758 --> 00:33:55.241
You will never escape me. Maya.

585
00:33:56.413 --> 00:33:57.206
Ever.

586
00:33:58.827 --> 00:33:59.758
My reach is too long.

587
00:34:07.655 --> 00:34:08.482
This right here?

588
00:34:09.793 --> 00:34:10.655
This is your problem

589
00:34:13.482 --> 00:34:15.137
because you're always
holding on to things

590
00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:16.275
that haunt our family.

591
00:34:27.724 --> 00:34:30.275
He was a better man
than you will ever be.

592
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.447
I thank God every day that those
kids are his and not yours.

593
00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:39.103
I hate you.

594
00:34:40.172 --> 00:34:41.206
I want my son.

595
00:35:17.137 --> 00:35:18.172
Ian.

596
00:35:20.689 --> 00:35:22.206
Mommy!

597
00:35:22.206 --> 00:35:23.862
Oh. hey. baby. hey.

598
00:35:25.793 --> 00:35:27.034
Is everything okay?

599
00:35:27.034 --> 00:35:28.068
Yeah. yeah.

600
00:35:28.068 --> 00:35:30.206
Maya just broke a glass.

601
00:35:30.206 --> 00:35:32.103
So. baby. watch your foot.

602
00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:33.793
It's okay. baby.
everything's fine.

603
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.068
Why don't you take
Noelle back outside

604
00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:39.137
while we clean up in here?

605
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:39.931
Where's Grace?

606
00:35:41.206 --> 00:35:42.379
She's in her room.

607
00:35:42.379 --> 00:35:43.931
You want me to go get her?

608
00:35:43.931 --> 00:35:45.827
No. no. no. I'll take her.

609
00:35:45.827 --> 00:35:47.862
I'll grab Grace too. 'cause I
gotta go to the store anyways.

610
00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:49.551
I'll help clean up.

611
00:35:49.551 --> 00:35:51.034
Let's let Maya clear her head.

612
00:35:51.034 --> 00:35:52.689
No. no. Noelle can go.

613
00:35:54.206 --> 00:35:56.137
Grace can stay right
here where she is.

614
00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:57.172
Here with Daddy.

615
00:35:58.551 --> 00:36:01.482
Okay. I'll stay and
give Grace her bath.

616
00:36:23.275 --> 00:36:24.275
What's going on over here?

617
00:36:24.275 --> 00:36:26.103
Is everything all right?

618
00:37:52.758 --> 00:37:54.379
Hernandez. you
know there's a reason

619
00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:56.000
why they refer to
it as a call in.

620
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.758
I'm not calling you in.

621
00:37:57.758 --> 00:38:00.000
We received a call from
one of your neighbors.

622
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.482
Something about a disturbance.

623
00:38:03.137 --> 00:38:05.034
You know. me and Maya.
we just had a little spat.

624
00:38:06.275 --> 00:38:07.310
I mean. you know how it is.

625
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.103
No. I don't.

626
00:38:09.482 --> 00:38:10.482
Can I come in?

627
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:23.103
So. where is Maya?

628
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:25.896
That's your wife's name. right?

629
00:38:25.896 --> 00:38:27.068
She went to the store.

630
00:38:27.068 --> 00:38:28.931
Is this really necessary?

631
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:31.034
We have to follow through
with any calls we receive.

632
00:38:32.241 --> 00:38:33.379
You know that.

633
00:38:36.103 --> 00:38:37.689
Liz. Liz.

634
00:38:37.689 --> 00:38:39.965
Always doing
everything by the book.

635
00:38:39.965 --> 00:38:40.793
That's me.

636
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.793
This way.

637
00:38:49.103 --> 00:38:50.586
Liz. this is our nanny. Elle.

638
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.517
Oh.

639
00:38:53.517 --> 00:38:55.689
Are you here to chat with
the soon to be Lieutenant?

640
00:38:55.689 --> 00:38:58.413
I wanted to talk
to Maya actually.

641
00:38:58.413 --> 00:39:00.241
Do you know when she'll be back?

642
00:39:00.241 --> 00:39:01.379
No idea.

643
00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:02.448
Sorry.

644
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.413
Is there a problem?

645
00:39:05.413 --> 00:39:07.206
One of the neighbors called.

646
00:39:07.206 --> 00:39:08.793
probably heard the scream
when Maya dropped the glass.

647
00:39:08.793 --> 00:39:10.310
You know how clumsy she can be.

648
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.379
Glass?

649
00:39:11.379 --> 00:39:13.482
Right. the glass.

650
00:39:18.344 --> 00:39:20.379
Sounds like it's
gonna be a long shift.

651
00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:21.172
Apparently.

652
00:39:22.206 --> 00:39:23.000
I gotta go.

653
00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:24.896
I'll see you tomorrow.

654
00:39:26.344 --> 00:39:27.482
Thanks for stopping by. Liz.

655
00:39:27.482 --> 00:39:29.482
It's always a pleasure.

656
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:44.793
Hey.

657
00:39:46.344 --> 00:39:48.241
I'm about to put the
kids down for a nap.

658
00:39:48.241 --> 00:39:51.758
Miss Grace won't sleep until
you sing the alphabet remix.

659
00:39:51.758 --> 00:39:54.793
Ah. she will be coming
after your job soon.

660
00:40:00.241 --> 00:40:01.689
You seen anything interesting?

661
00:40:06.896 --> 00:40:07.724
Are you all right?

662
00:40:10.034 --> 00:40:11.724
Oh. Maya. are you okay?

663
00:40:14.827 --> 00:40:16.482
Here. let me. let me help you.

664
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.344
Come on. I got you.

665
00:40:21.344 --> 00:40:22.137
Sorry.

666
00:40:24.896 --> 00:40:26.379
You okay?

667
00:40:26.379 --> 00:40:27.448
Yeah.

668
00:40:30.034 --> 00:40:33.689
Just haven't been feeling so
great these past couple days.

669
00:40:33.689 --> 00:40:35.482
Something like a stomach bug?

670
00:40:36.241 --> 00:40:37.000
Yeah.

671
00:40:39.862 --> 00:40:40.793
I guess so.

672
00:40:46.206 --> 00:40:48.000
Hey. Elle. don't
worry about it.

673
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.827
I don't think Maya's gonna
be eating with us anyway.

674
00:40:50.827 --> 00:40:52.827
You know. she's
not feeling well.

675
00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:53.827
She'll probably be down
for the rest of the night.

676
00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:55.482
Plus the kids already ate. so...

677
00:40:55.482 --> 00:40:57.241
Well. I don't mind
cooking for you.

678
00:40:57.241 --> 00:40:59.793
And I could eat.

679
00:40:59.793 --> 00:41:02.275
Maybe we just have
dinner together.

680
00:41:02.275 --> 00:41:03.724
if that's okay with you.

681
00:41:05.517 --> 00:41:07.068
Sure.

682
00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:08.413
All right.

683
00:41:08.413 --> 00:41:09.655
Go relax.

684
00:41:09.655 --> 00:41:11.000
I'll take care of everything.

685
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.517
I did. I used to play.

686
00:41:28.517 --> 00:41:29.724
I was really good.

687
00:41:29.724 --> 00:41:31.241
No.

688
00:41:31.241 --> 00:41:32.379
- Yes. I was.
- No. you weren't.

689
00:41:32.379 --> 00:41:33.827
Yeah. you should believe me.

690
00:41:33.827 --> 00:41:34.758
Don't I look like a
basketball player?

691
00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.034
Like. look at my arms.

692
00:41:36.034 --> 00:41:37.206
You don't.

693
00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:39.068
I work out.

694
00:41:39.068 --> 00:41:42.689
And I definitely. definitely
can shoot some hoops. so...

695
00:41:42.689 --> 00:41:44.448
Don't tell Maya about this.

696
00:41:44.448 --> 00:41:45.413
What?

697
00:41:45.413 --> 00:41:47.034
Of course not.

698
00:41:47.034 --> 00:41:47.862
Thank you.

699
00:41:49.241 --> 00:41:51.862
I haven't had the chance
to get to know you yet.

700
00:41:51.862 --> 00:41:54.206
so it's nice to have
a drink with you.

701
00:41:54.206 --> 00:41:56.068
It is nice.

702
00:41:56.068 --> 00:41:56.862
Cheers.

703
00:41:58.413 --> 00:42:00.448
And I deserve it. right?

704
00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:02.310
I do.

705
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.310
I mean. it's not like Maya's
here to nag me about it anyway.

706
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.586
Gosh. she worries too much.

707
00:42:08.689 --> 00:42:10.620
I can handle myself.

708
00:42:11.413 --> 00:42:12.241
She cares.

709
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:14.655
That's. that's what that is.

710
00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:15.931
That's what that is?

711
00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:17.482
Yeah.

712
00:42:17.482 --> 00:42:18.068
I mean. you guys
have a good thing.

713
00:42:20.448 --> 00:42:21.586
You know what?

714
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:25.379
I've been jealous
of women like Maya.

715
00:42:25.379 --> 00:42:26.103
Jealous. why?

716
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.000
I just. come on.

717
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.655
She has everything
that I've ever wanted.

718
00:42:32.655 --> 00:42:34.586
A good husband.

719
00:42:34.586 --> 00:42:36.827
This house is amazing.

720
00:42:36.827 --> 00:42:40.068
And your kids are so cute.

721
00:42:41.482 --> 00:42:42.931
They really are.

722
00:42:42.931 --> 00:42:44.275
I. I've always
wanted to be a mom.

723
00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:46.310
Really?

724
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:47.103
Mm-hmm.

725
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.586
I've always
wanted to be a dad.

726
00:42:50.586 --> 00:42:51.482
Really?

727
00:42:51.482 --> 00:42:53.344
Yeah.

728
00:42:53.344 --> 00:42:55.655
I mean. it'd be nice to
have one of my own one day.

729
00:42:57.137 --> 00:42:59.068
You know. I mean. gosh.

730
00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:02.103
that's all I've ever wanted.

731
00:43:02.103 --> 00:43:05.172
You know. my dad used
to always tell me.

732
00:43:05.172 --> 00:43:09.137
"A man's not a man unless
he knows how to raise one."

733
00:43:10.724 --> 00:43:12.379
Oh. well. that's an
interesting saying.

734
00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:15.758
He had a lot of them.

735
00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:19.827
All I've ever wanted to
do was to make him proud.

736
00:43:21.586 --> 00:43:25.862
Show him that I'm
my own man. right?

737
00:43:25.862 --> 00:43:27.827
Like. I hope I did that.

738
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.931
Yeah. well. I can relate.

739
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:37.000
I've had baby fever
since I was little.

740
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.551
Really?

741
00:43:38.551 --> 00:43:39.896
Yes. I remember my
kindergarten teacher.

742
00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:44.724
She. she was pregnant

743
00:43:44.724 --> 00:43:48.241
and the next year she had
the cutest little baby.

744
00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:50.068
I was so obsessed with him.

745
00:43:50.068 --> 00:43:52.896
I kept wanting to carry him
around every time she visited.

746
00:43:53.896 --> 00:43:55.241
She was my favorite teacher.

747
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.413
My kindergarten teacher
was a crazy bitch.

748
00:43:59.413 --> 00:44:00.827
Really?

749
00:44:00.827 --> 00:44:02.000
Yeah. my gosh.

750
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.103
So sorry. that's awful.

751
00:44:05.551 --> 00:44:08.310
Ms. Johnson.

752
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:09.724
Still remember her name.

753
00:44:09.724 --> 00:44:11.724
I will never forget her.

754
00:44:13.931 --> 00:44:15.620
Hey. where.

755
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.448
where'd you say you
went to school at again?

756
00:44:17.448 --> 00:44:18.413
Seattle.

757
00:44:19.758 --> 00:44:21.310
Hooping in Seattle.

758
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.586
Oh.

759
00:44:22.586 --> 00:44:23.103
Yeah. I didn't grow up here.

760
00:44:25.689 --> 00:44:30.310
Well. Miss Seattle.
who never played ball.

761
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.068
Come on.

762
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.724
I think you're going to
make a great mom one day.

763
00:44:38.241 --> 00:44:39.551
Cheers to that?

764
00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:41.551
Cheers to that.

765
00:44:43.586 --> 00:44:45.068
You didn't drink it.

766
00:44:45.068 --> 00:44:46.724
It's not real if
you don't drink it.

767
00:44:46.724 --> 00:44:48.206
I'm not worried about that.

768
00:44:52.413 --> 00:44:54.275
I'll...

769
00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:57.793
I'll check
on the girls when I head out.

770
00:44:58.793 --> 00:45:00.793
I gotta go to bed anyway. huh?

771
00:45:00.793 --> 00:45:04.793
Look. just maybe
not say anything.

772
00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:06.448
Keep this between us.

773
00:45:06.448 --> 00:45:08.000
Of course.

774
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.310
Good night. Elle.

775
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.275
Good night.

776
00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:18.448
Be careful.

777
00:45:18.448 --> 00:45:19.482
Them stairs.

778
00:45:19.482 --> 00:45:20.793
I know. I know.

779
00:45:42.965 --> 00:45:43.793
You.

780
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.275
You're unbelievable.

781
00:45:48.068 --> 00:45:50.206
I've done so much for you

782
00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:55.172
and you can't do this
one thing for me.

783
00:45:58.172 --> 00:45:58.965
Just one.

784
00:45:59.896 --> 00:46:01.517
But you know what?

785
00:46:05.758 --> 00:46:10.379
I realize there's so
many women out there

786
00:46:10.379 --> 00:46:12.206
that would love to
gimme what I need.

787
00:46:13.517 --> 00:46:14.344
You know why?

788
00:46:15.517 --> 00:46:16.344
No?

789
00:46:18.758 --> 00:46:21.379
'Cause I'm a good man.

790
00:46:21.379 --> 00:46:22.586
A damn good man.

791
00:46:24.206 --> 00:46:26.000
Life would be so much
easier without you.

792
00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.586
Why?

793
00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:32.896
So you can use my insurance
money to pay off your debts?

794
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:42.000
Huh.

795
00:46:44.137 --> 00:46:46.862
Now why didn't I think of that?

796
00:47:05.482 --> 00:47:07.448
No. no. no. no.

797
00:47:07.448 --> 00:47:08.586
Ian. Ian. stop.

798
00:47:10.206 --> 00:47:11.000
Ian. stop!

799
00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:13.344
Ian. I'm pregnant.

800
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:16.241
I'm pregnant.

801
00:47:17.965 --> 00:47:19.137
I'm pregnant.

802
00:47:20.931 --> 00:47:21.931
What?

803
00:47:24.586 --> 00:47:27.655
Are you serious?

804
00:47:27.655 --> 00:47:29.620
I'm serious. I'm serious.

805
00:47:36.862 --> 00:47:39.482
Baby. that explains it then.

806
00:47:41.379 --> 00:47:43.000
That explains it.

807
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.931
Why. why you've been so
hysterical. right. baby?

808
00:47:47.275 --> 00:47:49.551
Because of the hormones. right?

809
00:47:49.551 --> 00:47:53.965
Because. because
of the hormones. baby.

810
00:47:53.965 --> 00:47:58.172
Baby. baby. baby. we're
gonna have a child.

811
00:47:58.172 --> 00:47:59.000
Baby.

812
00:48:00.137 --> 00:48:02.896
Baby. we're gonna have a child.

813
00:48:02.896 --> 00:48:04.137
Oh my God. oh.

814
00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:07.034
Baby. you need your rest.

815
00:48:07.034 --> 00:48:09.000
You need your rest.

816
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.758
You need to rest.
come on. right here.

817
00:48:12.758 --> 00:48:14.172
Lay down right here. lay down.

818
00:48:14.172 --> 00:48:15.689
lay. lay. lay down.

819
00:48:22.896 --> 00:48:23.689
Baby.

820
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.379
You're pregnant. baby.

821
00:48:26.379 --> 00:48:28.172
You're pregnant.

822
00:48:28.172 --> 00:48:30.103
Baby. I'm gonna be a father.

823
00:48:30.103 --> 00:48:32.689
Thank you. thank you. thank you.

824
00:49:14.448 --> 00:49:16.310
Good to see you.

825
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.103
Thank you.

826
00:49:19.482 --> 00:49:20.896
Hey.

827
00:49:20.896 --> 00:49:22.655
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

828
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:25.896
Hey.

829
00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:28.482
Thanks. man. appreciate it.

830
00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:30.000
Good morning. Chief.

831
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.655
Good morning.

832
00:49:31.655 --> 00:49:32.448
LT.

833
00:49:34.586 --> 00:49:36.724
You are gonna be Lieutenant
by the end of the day.

834
00:49:36.724 --> 00:49:38.448
The paperwork is almost done.

835
00:49:38.448 --> 00:49:39.965
Congratulations.

836
00:49:39.965 --> 00:49:41.448
So proud of you.

837
00:49:41.448 --> 00:49:42.310
Thank you. Chief.
it's an honor.

838
00:49:43.137 --> 00:49:44.827
Hey. listen.

839
00:49:44.827 --> 00:49:46.000
Me and the guys
wanna take you out

840
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.137
at the end of the shift. right?

841
00:49:47.137 --> 00:49:48.310
So don't go anywhere. right?

842
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:49.137
- Let's do it.
- All right.

843
00:49:49.137 --> 00:49:50.310
You know where.

844
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.379
Excuse me.

845
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.137
Emily Stocklan called again.

846
00:49:54.137 --> 00:49:56.586
looking for a wellness
check on her dad.

847
00:49:56.586 --> 00:49:58.241
I told you we don't have
the manpower for that.

848
00:49:58.241 --> 00:49:59.000
Wait. wait. wait.

849
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.620
Who?

850
00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.241
A woman wants us to
check in on her father.

851
00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:04.068
Apparently he's not
answering the phone.

852
00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:06.068
She's called three
times this morning.

853
00:50:06.068 --> 00:50:07.206
What's the address?

854
00:50:11.448 --> 00:50:13.068
What?

855
00:50:13.068 --> 00:50:16.413
It's my neighbor.
older guy. confused.

856
00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:18.931
Chief. you mind if I pop
in and check in on him?

857
00:50:18.931 --> 00:50:20.068
I'll come with you.

858
00:50:20.068 --> 00:50:21.620
No. no. it's. it's fine.

859
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.896
You should have
someone with you.

860
00:50:22.896 --> 00:50:23.724
I said I can handle it. Liz.

861
00:50:23.724 --> 00:50:25.586
Hey. hey. hey.

862
00:50:25.586 --> 00:50:26.758
Both of you go.

863
00:50:26.758 --> 00:50:27.551
Make it fast.

864
00:50:41.068 --> 00:50:42.137
Have you seen
him around lately?

865
00:50:42.137 --> 00:50:44.137
A couple days ago.

866
00:50:44.137 --> 00:50:46.206
He dropped off some mail
that he grabbed by accident.

867
00:50:51.724 --> 00:50:52.551
Mr. Stocklan!

868
00:50:53.724 --> 00:50:55.034
It's Ian Flynn. your neighbor!

869
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.206
Let's go around back.

870
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.793
Oh. wait a minute. wait.

871
00:51:12.793 --> 00:51:14.793
I think I see something.

872
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.896
Hey. Chief.

873
00:51:42.896 --> 00:51:45.310
Yeah. suicide from
the looks of it.

874
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.655
Yeah. coroner's taking
a look right now.

875
00:51:46.655 --> 00:51:49.551
but it looks like it's
gonna be pretty cut and dry.

876
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:50.793
Yeah. yeah.

877
00:51:50.793 --> 00:51:51.827
Okay.

878
00:51:51.827 --> 00:51:53.896
Hernandez is talking to
the family right now.

879
00:51:53.896 --> 00:51:55.137
Okay.

880
00:51:55.137 --> 00:51:56.482
No. no. no. it's fine.
I'll. I'll wait around.

881
00:51:56.482 --> 00:51:58.724
You know. just in case
they need anything.

882
00:51:59.862 --> 00:52:01.275
All right. bye-bye.

883
00:52:04.068 --> 00:52:05.620
Talk to the daughter?

884
00:52:06.689 --> 00:52:08.206
Did you know him well?

885
00:52:09.103 --> 00:52:11.034
Ran into him in the streets
a couple times. you know?

886
00:52:11.034 --> 00:52:13.931
Lonely guy. but friendly.

887
00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:14.965
Seemed nice.

888
00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:15.862
It's a shame.

889
00:52:15.862 --> 00:52:17.172
Yeah.

890
00:52:18.827 --> 00:52:21.241
His daughter says it
came outta nowhere.

891
00:52:21.241 --> 00:52:22.448
Well. I mean.

892
00:52:22.448 --> 00:52:24.310
some people don't talk
about anything. you know?

893
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:25.103
That's the way it is.

894
00:52:25.103 --> 00:52:26.206
Especially family.

895
00:52:26.206 --> 00:52:28.275
He had his keys on him.

896
00:52:28.275 --> 00:52:29.931
Your point?

897
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:32.862
His house keys. in his pocket.

898
00:52:34.379 --> 00:52:36.103
Who carries their
keys around on them

899
00:52:36.103 --> 00:52:38.724
when they're planning
on killing themself?

900
00:52:38.724 --> 00:52:40.620
A lonely old man. Liz.

901
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.344
Everybody's not as
sharp as you. Hernandez.

902
00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:46.689
Yeah. but something's off.

903
00:52:48.275 --> 00:52:50.206
Well. we'll wait for a
coroner's report. you know.

904
00:52:50.206 --> 00:52:52.620
get a cause of death.

905
00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.413
But. I mean. it
just is what it is.

906
00:52:55.413 --> 00:52:58.448
I mean. we have our people
looking at the scene. Liz.

907
00:52:59.482 --> 00:53:02.310
I mean. this guy. I mean. there
was no fingerprints. right?

908
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.275
Nobody forced
themselves in the house.

909
00:53:04.275 --> 00:53:06.275
This guy had no enemies.

910
00:53:06.275 --> 00:53:08.344
Just a lonely old man

911
00:53:08.344 --> 00:53:10.827
who his only family lived
hours away from him.

912
00:53:12.517 --> 00:53:15.034
You know. sometimes the
answer's right in front of you.

913
00:53:15.034 --> 00:53:17.000
Don't think too hard.

914
00:53:18.827 --> 00:53:20.724
I'm gonna stick around.

915
00:53:20.724 --> 00:53:23.586
Why don't you head back to
the station. Lieutenant?

916
00:53:24.724 --> 00:53:26.931
Sure there's a party
brewing for you

917
00:53:26.931 --> 00:53:28.758
that you should get back to.

918
00:53:30.103 --> 00:53:31.931
Yeah. right.

919
00:54:12.344 --> 00:54:14.724
Are you ready for
the tickle monster?

920
00:54:19.379 --> 00:54:20.517
Oh. bedtime
already. huh?

921
00:54:20.517 --> 00:54:22.965
Will you tell me
a bedtime story?

922
00:54:22.965 --> 00:54:27.655
Well. the only one I know
is about a Queen Noelle.

923
00:54:27.655 --> 00:54:29.034
Have you ever heard of that one?

924
00:54:30.103 --> 00:54:30.862
- No.
- No?

925
00:54:32.689 --> 00:54:36.034
Well. there once was a
beautiful queen named Noelle.

926
00:54:36.034 --> 00:54:39.172
She lived in a magical castle
with her sister. Grace.

927
00:54:39.172 --> 00:54:39.931
and their mom.

928
00:54:41.689 --> 00:54:44.827
And her big crown
and her big sword.

929
00:54:44.827 --> 00:54:46.689
Of course.

930
00:54:46.689 --> 00:54:50.241
So when there was a dragon that
came to attack the castle...

931
00:54:50.241 --> 00:54:51.724
She fought it.

932
00:54:51.724 --> 00:54:52.586
No.

933
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:56.413
Queen Noelle was way
smarter than that.

934
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.620
She knew there were
people inside that castle

935
00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.379
who could be hurt
by that dragon.

936
00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:03.896
So instead of fighting.

937
00:55:03.896 --> 00:55:06.068
she helped them escape
to another castle

938
00:55:06.068 --> 00:55:07.931
deep inside the woods

939
00:55:07.931 --> 00:55:10.793
where she knew they would
be safe from that dragon.

940
00:55:10.793 --> 00:55:13.310
Queen Noelle wouldn't
run away from a fight.

941
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:14.379
Hmm.

942
00:55:15.793 --> 00:55:17.586
Well. sometimes running away is

943
00:55:19.172 --> 00:55:20.724
the smartest thing you can do.

944
00:57:47.379 --> 00:57:48.172
Noelle?

945
00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:50.862
Maya!

946
00:57:50.862 --> 00:57:51.724
Noelle?

947
00:57:51.724 --> 00:57:52.379
Grace?

948
00:57:52.379 --> 00:57:53.965
Maya!

949
00:57:53.965 --> 00:57:55.137
Oh my God.

950
00:57:55.137 --> 00:57:56.620
Ian. why are you yelling?

951
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.034
Hey. baby. the.
the kids are missing.

952
00:57:58.034 --> 00:57:59.379
What do you mean
they're missing?

953
00:57:59.379 --> 00:58:00.896
They're not in their rooms.

954
00:58:00.896 --> 00:58:02.172
They're gone. I don't
know where they are.

955
00:58:02.172 --> 00:58:02.655
- Ian!
- Noelle!

956
00:58:04.137 --> 00:58:05.655
- Oh my God.
- Grace!

957
00:58:08.965 --> 00:58:11.103
I didn't hear
anything. I don't know.

958
00:58:12.965 --> 00:58:15.931
What time do you think
you went to bed last night?

959
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:16.862
Maybe 10.

960
00:58:18.724 --> 00:58:20.758
The next thing I know. Ian
is yelling that they're gone.

961
00:58:25.275 --> 00:58:26.689
It's okay.

962
00:58:26.689 --> 00:58:28.000
We're gonna find them.

963
00:58:29.103 --> 00:58:30.655
Okay?

964
00:58:30.655 --> 00:58:32.896
Now. I don't know
if Ian told you.

965
00:58:32.896 --> 00:58:34.931
but I stopped by your
house the other day.

966
00:58:37.241 --> 00:58:38.793
Why?

967
00:58:38.793 --> 00:58:39.689
We got a call from
one of your neighbors

968
00:58:39.689 --> 00:58:40.931
about a disturbance.

969
00:58:42.206 --> 00:58:44.793
And I saw you guys have
some cameras set up.

970
00:58:44.793 --> 00:58:46.758
Please don't tell Ian.

971
00:58:46.758 --> 00:58:48.586
He has no idea
that I have those.

972
00:58:48.586 --> 00:58:49.793
And what do you mean?

973
00:58:51.827 --> 00:58:53.862
He wanted me to take them down

974
00:58:53.862 --> 00:58:55.862
'cause he thought they
looked creepy. but I didn't.

975
00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:01.344
That footage gets
downloaded to my computer.

976
00:59:01.344 --> 00:59:05.034
but I have no idea what. or if
anything useful is on there.

977
00:59:06.896 --> 00:59:08.655
Well. why did you put
them up in the first place?

978
00:59:10.586 --> 00:59:12.172
Because I was
going back to work

979
00:59:14.068 --> 00:59:17.896
and I wanted to keep an eye
on the nanny and the kids.

980
00:59:20.551 --> 00:59:21.931
I know. Chief.

981
00:59:26.206 --> 00:59:27.137
Right.

982
00:59:28.586 --> 00:59:29.344
Give me a second.

983
00:59:35.965 --> 00:59:37.827
We're gonna pull out
every resource we have.

984
00:59:37.827 --> 00:59:39.310
Chief. those are my kids.

985
00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:40.068
I know.

986
00:59:47.034 --> 00:59:50.000
I think they're finished
sweeping your house for prints.

987
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.034
so you and Ian are
fine to go back.

988
00:59:54.034 --> 00:59:58.724
But when you do. I want you to
plug this into your computer.

989
01:00:03.551 --> 01:00:05.689
It'll give me remote access

990
01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:07.310
and let me look
through the footage.

991
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.379
Thank you.

992
01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:20.241
You're welcome.

993
01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:32.448
Only you would sleep
through the kidnapping

994
01:00:32.448 --> 01:00:33.344
of your own children.

995
01:00:37.379 --> 01:00:38.758
I can't do this.

996
01:00:40.344 --> 01:00:41.172
I need some air.

997
01:00:43.068 --> 01:00:44.689
Flynn!

998
01:00:44.689 --> 01:00:45.931
There's something
you need to see.

999
01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:52.068
Well. we're currently waiting
on fingerprint analysis.

1000
01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:54.172
Locks on the back
door were broken

1001
01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:56.068
and it looked like
nothing was stolen.

1002
01:01:06.379 --> 01:01:07.379
Elle.

1003
01:01:10.103 --> 01:01:11.344
Ian.

1004
01:01:11.344 --> 01:01:12.827
What the hell is happening?

1005
01:01:12.827 --> 01:01:13.931
Maya texted me to
come to the station.

1006
01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:16.344
Kids are gone.

1007
01:01:16.344 --> 01:01:17.482
What do you mean gone?

1008
01:01:17.482 --> 01:01:18.620
I just saw them last night.

1009
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.551
Where's Maya?

1010
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:21.103
I don't know.

1011
01:01:21.103 --> 01:01:22.827
She went to get some
air or something.

1012
01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:24.413
Let me go see
if I can find her.

1013
01:01:24.413 --> 01:01:26.655
but just call me if you
need something. okay?

1014
01:01:26.655 --> 01:01:28.655
Hey. can we chat real quick?

1015
01:01:28.655 --> 01:01:30.034
I'd love to get a statement.

1016
01:01:31.448 --> 01:01:32.241
Of course.

1017
01:01:48.655 --> 01:01:50.034
Everything good over there?

1018
01:01:51.517 --> 01:01:52.965
Yeah. yeah. I'll be back soon.

1019
01:01:54.517 --> 01:01:55.793
Oh. it's fine. I'm
using a burner.

1020
01:02:01.448 --> 01:02:02.620
Ian.

1021
01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:02.896
Something's wrong.

1022
01:02:04.275 --> 01:02:04.896
What?

1023
01:02:13.034 --> 01:02:16.172
So I dug a little deeper.

1024
01:02:16.172 --> 01:02:18.655
There's no one named Elle Taylor

1025
01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:20.827
that's even registered
in this state.

1026
01:02:21.793 --> 01:02:23.344
She doesn't exist.

1027
01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:27.827
Who is she?

1028
01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.448
Okay.

1029
01:02:45.172 --> 01:02:47.793
We have facial recognition
software running.

1030
01:02:47.793 --> 01:02:48.793
We'll find her.

1031
01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:51.172
Hernandez. we
need you out here.

1032
01:03:10.379 --> 01:03:13.689
Sorry. Chief. I
gotta find my wife.

1033
01:03:44.379 --> 01:03:45.793
Maya!

1034
01:03:53.241 --> 01:03:54.413
Rachelle Turner.

1035
01:04:19.931 --> 01:04:20.862
What's going on over here?

1036
01:04:20.862 --> 01:04:22.034
Is everything all right?

1037
01:04:22.034 --> 01:04:23.620
Everything's fine. sir.

1038
01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.413
Can I help you?

1039
01:04:28.655 --> 01:04:29.482
Ian?

1040
01:04:31.586 --> 01:04:33.103
Mr. Stocklan.

1041
01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:35.034
Heard a commotion
coming from your house.

1042
01:04:35.034 --> 01:04:37.758
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1043
01:04:37.758 --> 01:04:39.275
Are you feeling all right?

1044
01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:41.206
I'd like to speak
with your wife.

1045
01:04:41.206 --> 01:04:42.655
She's out back
taking out the garbage.

1046
01:04:42.655 --> 01:04:44.620
We had a little accident.

1047
01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.103
But I'm sure she'll tell you

1048
01:04:46.103 --> 01:04:48.068
that this was all just
a misunderstanding.

1049
01:04:49.689 --> 01:04:50.689
Here. let me show you.

1050
01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:51.517
Take you out back.

1051
01:04:58.758 --> 01:05:00.827
I guess she'll be back.

1052
01:05:00.827 --> 01:05:01.655
Where is she?

1053
01:05:03.172 --> 01:05:04.862
She went to the store.

1054
01:05:04.862 --> 01:05:06.241
It's funny. she
was just out here.

1055
01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:07.827
I heard her scream.

1056
01:05:07.827 --> 01:05:09.206
I saw you hit her!

1057
01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:11.206
I've already called the police.

1058
01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:12.689
They're on their way.

1059
01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:43.000
Chief!

1060
01:05:45.206 --> 01:05:46.724
Chief!

1061
01:05:46.724 --> 01:05:48.206
So this whole time.

1062
01:05:48.206 --> 01:05:49.827
you've been some sort
of actress. right?

1063
01:05:49.827 --> 01:05:51.275
It's not what you think.

1064
01:05:51.275 --> 01:05:53.344
Well. correct me if I'm wrong.

1065
01:05:53.344 --> 01:05:55.448
I think Rachelle went
to our high school.

1066
01:05:55.448 --> 01:05:56.827
I think you know
that she never worked

1067
01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:58.000
for a nannying company.

1068
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.586
You hired her. independently.

1069
01:06:00.586 --> 01:06:03.000
I think you knew that she
was using a fake name.

1070
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Hell. I think you knew
that this whole time.

1071
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.172
she was the one trying
to kidnap our kids.

1072
01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:09.241
They're not your kids.

1073
01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:13.413
No you don't.

1074
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.896
I got you. Rachelle.

1075
01:07:32.896 --> 01:07:34.137
What's her name?

1076
01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:35.379
What's my girl's
name right here?

1077
01:07:36.827 --> 01:07:39.000
Hmm. oh. wow.

1078
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.172
Good job.

1079
01:07:40.172 --> 01:07:42.241
That's nice.

1080
01:07:42.241 --> 01:07:45.620
Okay. so now we should. we
should see if the giraffe...

1081
01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:49.724
Girls. girls. shh.

1082
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.965
Let's play quietly. okay?

1083
01:07:52.965 --> 01:07:55.965
Stay right here
and play quietly.

1084
01:07:55.965 --> 01:07:56.793
I'll be right back.

1085
01:08:29.862 --> 01:08:32.033
Thank God you're all right.

1086
01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:33.517
I was so worried he'd hurt you.

1087
01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:38.103
Thank you for
everything. Rachelle.

1088
01:08:38.103 --> 01:08:39.550
They're safe.

1089
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.413
We did it.

1090
01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:41.517
We got away with it.

1091
01:08:42.862 --> 01:08:43.792
We're not safe yet.

1092
01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:46.862
He knows about you.

1093
01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:51.517
Noelle. Grace.

1094
01:08:53.758 --> 01:08:55.517
Babies. are you there?

1095
01:08:55.517 --> 01:08:57.033
Oh!

1096
01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.379
Oh. look at you.

1097
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:02.827
Oh. I'm so happy to see you.

1098
01:09:02.827 --> 01:09:04.309
Are you guys okay?

1099
01:09:10.137 --> 01:09:12.033
Thank you for
everything. Rachelle.

1100
01:09:12.033 --> 01:09:14.931
You girls always had my
back. ever since high school.

1101
01:09:16.517 --> 01:09:18.448
Sis.
you know I got you.

1102
01:09:20.172 --> 01:09:21.792
Sorry I've been
away for so long.

1103
01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.344
I still can't forgive myself
for missing the funeral.

1104
01:09:26.344 --> 01:09:28.344
No. what matters is
that you're here now.

1105
01:09:28.344 --> 01:09:30.448
If you weren't traveling
and working so much.

1106
01:09:30.448 --> 01:09:33.033
you wouldn't have
this beautiful ranch.

1107
01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:33.827
Yeah.

1108
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.241
And we should be safe here.

1109
01:09:38.482 --> 01:09:40.448
If you would've told
me what was going on.

1110
01:09:40.448 --> 01:09:43.103
I would've left
sooner. seriously.

1111
01:09:43.103 --> 01:09:44.585
Rachelle. no one knew.

1112
01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:47.309
And I was stupid enough

1113
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:48.931
to think that I could
handle it by myself.

1114
01:09:51.931 --> 01:09:53.033
He was keeping me disoriented.

1115
01:09:53.033 --> 01:09:54.172
away from my family and friends.

1116
01:09:54.172 --> 01:09:55.448
I was done.

1117
01:09:57.309 --> 01:09:59.448
And trust that he would've
tried to pull us apart.

1118
01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:01.275
Never.

1119
01:10:02.862 --> 01:10:04.517
We go too far back for that.

1120
01:10:06.103 --> 01:10:07.620
Everything's gonna be fine now.

1121
01:10:10.482 --> 01:10:13.448
I think me going to the
police station worked.

1122
01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:15.275
made me seem less
suspicious to Ian.

1123
01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.206
Yeah. well. I think
it was a good idea

1124
01:10:18.206 --> 01:10:19.309
that I brought that
stupid sandwich

1125
01:10:19.309 --> 01:10:20.517
and pretended it was his lunch!

1126
01:10:21.379 --> 01:10:22.827
You know what?

1127
01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:23.758
That's my girl.

1128
01:10:26.275 --> 01:10:28.585
Sometimes you gotta
laugh instead of crying.

1129
01:10:30.862 --> 01:10:32.241
Rachelle. I'm scared of him.

1130
01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.413
That man is dangerous.

1131
01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.448
And it's only a matter of time

1132
01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:41.585
before he figures
everything out and finds us.

1133
01:10:43.482 --> 01:10:45.344
That man is never gonna stop
looking for me. Rachelle.

1134
01:10:49.103 --> 01:10:50.413
And I guess his plan worked.

1135
01:10:54.172 --> 01:10:55.344
I'm pregnant.

1136
01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:02.448
So now what's gonna
happen to me and my girls?

1137
01:11:02.448 --> 01:11:04.517
Nothing's gonna happen.

1138
01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:05.862
Our plan won't change.

1139
01:11:07.689 --> 01:11:11.275
I should have left
that man a long time ago.

1140
01:11:11.275 --> 01:11:13.344
but I was afraid that
he would hurt himself

1141
01:11:14.448 --> 01:11:16.379
like his dad did.

1142
01:11:16.379 --> 01:11:18.448
Wait. you never
told me about his dad.

1143
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:19.655
He was a cop too.

1144
01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:24.862
Struggled with depression
and took his own life.

1145
01:11:24.862 --> 01:11:26.000
right before I met Ian.

1146
01:11:27.758 --> 01:11:29.550
God. I put myself.

1147
01:11:31.931 --> 01:11:35.413
I put my girls in danger
because I pitied him.

1148
01:11:37.689 --> 01:11:39.103
I thought that I could save him

1149
01:11:39.103 --> 01:11:41.655
and in the meantime lost myself.

1150
01:11:43.585 --> 01:11:48.000
Girl. some things we have to
turn over to God and therapy.

1151
01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:51.206
You were never meant
to save that man.

1152
01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.413
Yes. but by the
time I realized that.

1153
01:11:52.413 --> 01:11:54.241
he threatened to set me up.

1154
01:11:54.241 --> 01:11:56.517
Just stop it. okay?

1155
01:11:56.517 --> 01:11:58.517
That's why we're here.

1156
01:11:58.517 --> 01:12:00.448
That's why you devised a
plan that's going to work.

1157
01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:01.931
We just have to follow it.

1158
01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:06.585
My friend will have new
IDs for you by morning.

1159
01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:08.585
I'll disappear with the girls

1160
01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:10.344
and you go to the police and
tell them everything you have.

1161
01:12:10.344 --> 01:12:13.103
I just told you. he's
the new lieutenant.

1162
01:12:13.103 --> 01:12:15.034
Everybody over there loves him.

1163
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.965
Now. Rachelle. I'm
trying to tell you

1164
01:12:17.965 --> 01:12:19.655
that I don't know about
this plan anymore.

1165
01:12:19.655 --> 01:12:22.793
No. we're sure about the plan.

1166
01:12:22.793 --> 01:12:24.724
Didn't you say you
trust that lady cop?

1167
01:12:26.344 --> 01:12:27.931
I don't know if I
trust anyone anymore.

1168
01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.068
Someone's at the gate.

1169
01:12:32.068 --> 01:12:33.137
Here it is.

1170
01:12:33.137 --> 01:12:33.931
Here.

1171
01:12:37.344 --> 01:12:38.103
We have to go.

1172
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:39.931
My God.

1173
01:12:46.517 --> 01:12:47.620
My God. we gotta get outta here.

1174
01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.309
Okay. go grab the bags.

1175
01:12:49.309 --> 01:12:50.655
There's only one
road in and out.

1176
01:12:50.655 --> 01:12:52.758
They're already on their way.

1177
01:12:52.758 --> 01:12:54.585
Noelle. come on. let's go
to my secret hiding place.

1178
01:12:54.585 --> 01:12:56.103
Let's go. let me show you.

1179
01:12:56.103 --> 01:12:56.965
Here's Mama.

1180
01:12:56.965 --> 01:12:58.000
Hey. baby.

1181
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.172
Okay. this is yours.

1182
01:12:59.172 --> 01:13:00.758
I wanna stay here with you.

1183
01:13:00.758 --> 01:13:02.379
No. no. no. no. no.
baby. listen. listen.

1184
01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:03.482
We're just playing
hide and seek. okay?

1185
01:13:03.482 --> 01:13:05.241
I need you to hide for Mommy.

1186
01:13:05.241 --> 01:13:07.550
Just promise me you'll take
care of your sister. okay?

1187
01:13:08.655 --> 01:13:10.379
Okay. I love you so much.

1188
01:13:10.379 --> 01:13:12.550
Okay. you guys get
outta here. okay?

1189
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:14.448
It'll be just fine.
baby. I promise.

1190
01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:16.137
Got it. baby?

1191
01:13:16.137 --> 01:13:17.379
Come on. okay.

1192
01:13:17.379 --> 01:13:18.448
Got it?

1193
01:13:18.448 --> 01:13:19.103
Alright. let's go.

1194
01:13:29.793 --> 01:13:31.413
Come on.

1195
01:13:31.413 --> 01:13:35.241
Let's go. let's keep
going. go to the right.

1196
01:13:35.241 --> 01:13:36.034
Okay.

1197
01:13:41.965 --> 01:13:43.000
Okay.

1198
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.344
Stay right here. okay?

1199
01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:45.655
Until I come and get you.

1200
01:13:47.068 --> 01:13:47.862
Okay.

1201
01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:51.655
Sorry.

1202
01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:01.034
Okay.

1203
01:14:06.724 --> 01:14:07.517
Okay.

1204
01:14:18.379 --> 01:14:20.379
Forgive me for
bringing you into this.

1205
01:14:20.379 --> 01:14:22.448
That's what sisters are for.

1206
01:14:22.448 --> 01:14:23.517
Okay?

1207
01:14:24.275 --> 01:14:25.034
Maya!

1208
01:14:27.862 --> 01:14:30.931
Baby. I know you're in there.

1209
01:14:30.931 --> 01:14:31.758
Elle!

1210
01:14:33.206 --> 01:14:36.103
Or should I call you Rachelle?

1211
01:14:36.103 --> 01:14:37.655
Come out. both of you.

1212
01:14:37.655 --> 01:14:38.965
or I will come in
and drag you out.

1213
01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:42.172
We're making it outta
this together. you hear me?

1214
01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:45.172
Come on. baby. I'm
giving you a choice!

1215
01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.448
That's how you wanna play?

1216
01:14:48.448 --> 01:14:51.068
You can never make things easy
for me. can you. sweetheart?

1217
01:15:03.379 --> 01:15:04.793
Come on. come on.

1218
01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:27.448
Everything's gonna be okay.

1219
01:15:27.448 --> 01:15:28.172
I'll protect you.

1220
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:31.309
I'll shoot if either
one of you move.

1221
01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:33.793
Do it. coward.

1222
01:15:33.793 --> 01:15:35.482
Where are the girls?

1223
01:15:35.482 --> 01:15:37.620
You will never
see my babies again.

1224
01:15:39.413 --> 01:15:40.793
Don't you dare.

1225
01:15:42.655 --> 01:15:46.241
If you shoot her. I will
kill myself and your baby.

1226
01:15:50.448 --> 01:15:51.758
Baby. you ain't got it in you.

1227
01:15:51.758 --> 01:15:52.931
I don't believe you.

1228
01:15:52.931 --> 01:15:53.793
Try me.

1229
01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.517
No one's here.

1230
01:16:01.517 --> 01:16:02.655
The place is torn up.

1231
01:16:04.103 --> 01:16:05.896
What could he have
done with her?

1232
01:16:07.275 --> 01:16:09.896
If you just let Elle
go. I will go with you.

1233
01:16:11.793 --> 01:16:15.689
I won't hurt myself or our
baby if you just let her go.

1234
01:16:17.103 --> 01:16:18.344
No. no.

1235
01:16:18.344 --> 01:16:20.137
She'll tell everybody.

1236
01:16:20.137 --> 01:16:21.275
Oh. no. no. no. baby. we're
in the middle of nowhere.

1237
01:16:21.275 --> 01:16:22.862
She won't have time.

1238
01:16:22.862 --> 01:16:25.344
Honey. we will be long gone.

1239
01:16:25.344 --> 01:16:26.448
All right?

1240
01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:27.172
You. me. and our family.

1241
01:16:30.034 --> 01:16:31.655
'Cause we're family. right?

1242
01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:32.724
Yes. baby.

1243
01:16:32.724 --> 01:16:33.896
That's right.

1244
01:16:33.896 --> 01:16:35.517
Better than my old man. right?

1245
01:16:35.517 --> 01:16:36.517
And I never abandoned you.

1246
01:16:36.517 --> 01:16:38.172
I never abandoned you.

1247
01:16:38.172 --> 01:16:39.172
No. no. no. no. no.

1248
01:16:39.172 --> 01:16:40.689
You tried to leave me.

1249
01:16:40.689 --> 01:16:41.862
Because pregnancy
makes you confused.

1250
01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:44.172
Okay?

1251
01:16:44.172 --> 01:16:45.689
It's okay.

1252
01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:47.517
I promise you. we
can just leave.

1253
01:16:47.517 --> 01:16:49.275
We can get out of town.

1254
01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:52.413
and I promise you. promise you
that I will obey this time.

1255
01:16:52.413 --> 01:16:54.103
Okay?

1256
01:16:54.103 --> 01:16:59.068
All you have to do
is let Rachelle go.

1257
01:16:59.758 --> 01:17:01.585
Ian. come on.

1258
01:17:01.585 --> 01:17:03.309
You know how to
make us disappear.

1259
01:17:03.309 --> 01:17:04.655
Yeah?

1260
01:17:04.655 --> 01:17:06.309
Yeah.

1261
01:17:06.309 --> 01:17:09.620
Listen. Ian. she'll
just slow us down.

1262
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.309
Just let her go.

1263
01:17:11.309 --> 01:17:13.482
She serves no purpose.
honey. come on.

1264
01:17:13.482 --> 01:17:16.068
it's just us and the family.

1265
01:17:16.068 --> 01:17:18.379
Elle. get outta here
before I change my mind.

1266
01:17:19.309 --> 01:17:20.137
Go!

1267
01:17:21.448 --> 01:17:23.034
It's okay. it's okay. go. go!

1268
01:17:33.931 --> 01:17:34.896
Hello?

1269
01:17:34.896 --> 01:17:36.793
Can somebody hear me?

1270
01:17:36.793 --> 01:17:37.827
Hello. hello?

1271
01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:39.655
Can somebody hear me?

1272
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.206
We need help. hello.

1273
01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.862
How do I know
you won't shoot me?

1274
01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.550
Baby. I have my priorities
straight. all right?

1275
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:07.448
Okay.

1276
01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:09.309
Okay.

1277
01:18:09.309 --> 01:18:10.793
Just put the gun down so
I know you won't hurt me.

1278
01:18:10.793 --> 01:18:12.585
All right.

1279
01:18:12.585 --> 01:18:14.275
All right. it's
going away. okay?

1280
01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:17.517
It's gone. okay?

1281
01:18:17.517 --> 01:18:18.827
Baby. put the knife down.

1282
01:18:20.309 --> 01:18:21.965
Come on. put it down.

1283
01:18:23.275 --> 01:18:24.103
Okay.

1284
01:18:31.344 --> 01:18:32.689
Okay. come here.

1285
01:18:32.689 --> 01:18:34.103
Come here. baby.

1286
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.413
Okay. now where did you stash
the girls over here. right?

1287
01:18:39.413 --> 01:18:43.620
Tell 'em that daddy's home to
come save the day. all right?

1288
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.482
Okay?
Okay.

1289
01:18:45.482 --> 01:18:48.137
You can just stay right
here and I'll go get them.

1290
01:18:51.413 --> 01:18:53.793
How should I explain
all this to the girls?

1291
01:18:55.137 --> 01:18:58.275
Just. just tell 'em
the truth. baby. okay?

1292
01:19:00.172 --> 01:19:02.000
Tell 'em that Elle made Mommy
and Daddy fight. all right.

1293
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.413
and now she's gone and
she'll never come back. okay?

1294
01:19:04.413 --> 01:19:05.793
Okay. okay.

1295
01:19:05.793 --> 01:19:07.827
Would you mind getting my car?

1296
01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:10.034
Because yours is gonna
be too easy to track.

1297
01:19:10.034 --> 01:19:10.793
What are you talking about?

1298
01:19:10.793 --> 01:19:11.931
I'm not stupid.

1299
01:19:11.931 --> 01:19:12.758
No. no. no. Ian. I
know that you're not-

1300
01:19:29.413 --> 01:19:30.724
Oh. babies. babies.

1301
01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:31.585
- Mommy!
- I love you so much.

1302
01:19:31.585 --> 01:19:32.655
Come on.
What's going on?

1303
01:19:32.655 --> 01:19:34.689
It's okay. baby. everything's
gonna be just fine.

1304
01:19:34.689 --> 01:19:36.000
Come on now. hurry.

1305
01:19:38.137 --> 01:19:40.793
We're fine. baby. we're fine!

1306
01:19:40.793 --> 01:19:42.758
Okay. Noelle. don't
hurt yourself!

1307
01:19:42.758 --> 01:19:44.862
Okay. Noelle. go
in the other side.

1308
01:19:44.862 --> 01:19:45.758
Go in the other side.

1309
01:19:45.758 --> 01:19:47.241
Okay. Grace. let's get in here.

1310
01:19:54.517 --> 01:19:55.931
Okay.

1311
01:19:55.931 --> 01:19:57.965
Come on. Elle. come on!

1312
01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:00.241
It's okay. baby.

1313
01:20:00.241 --> 01:20:00.931
It's okay.

1314
01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:02.550
You guys okay?

1315
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:03.862
Yeah. we need
to go. we need to go!

1316
01:20:03.862 --> 01:20:05.241
Ian. no!

1317
01:20:05.241 --> 01:20:07.206
Ian. the girls are in the car!

1318
01:20:07.206 --> 01:20:08.034
Stop it!

1319
01:20:08.034 --> 01:20:09.448
Oh my God. what do I do?

1320
01:20:09.448 --> 01:20:11.206
Elle. what do I do?

1321
01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:14.517
I don't know. drive the car!

1322
01:20:26.793 --> 01:20:29.103
Maya. Rachelle.
are you all right?

1323
01:20:29.103 --> 01:20:29.896
Yeah.

1324
01:20:31.517 --> 01:20:32.620
Ian. he...

1325
01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.448
Where is he?

1326
01:20:36.309 --> 01:20:40.068
Right there.

1327
01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:44.482
Lieutenant Flynn. you have
the right to remain silent.

1328
01:20:44.482 --> 01:20:46.241
Anything you say...

1329
01:21:24.862 --> 01:21:26.482
Right.

1330
01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:28.206
♪ Merrily. merrily.
merrily. merrily ♪

1331
01:21:28.206 --> 01:21:30.034
♪ Life is but a dream

1332
01:21:30.034 --> 01:21:31.862
Good job today!

1333
01:21:31.862 --> 01:21:33.379
Oh my gosh.

1334
01:21:33.379 --> 01:21:35.862
All right. I'll
see you tomorrow.

1335
01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:37.758
Whew. good job!

1336
01:21:37.758 --> 01:21:40.034
They love you so much.

1337
01:21:40.034 --> 01:21:42.137
They're gonna be so upset
when you leave again.

1338
01:21:42.137 --> 01:21:43.344
I won't be gone long.

1339
01:21:44.862 --> 01:21:46.482
Thanks for covering
my class for me.

1340
01:21:46.482 --> 01:21:48.034
Of course.

1341
01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:49.068
It's my pleasure.

1342
01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.758
That used to be the song.

1343
01:21:54.758 --> 01:21:55.931
So good to see you ladies.

1344
01:21:55.931 --> 01:21:57.482
You too. you too.

1345
01:21:57.482 --> 01:21:58.965
Wow. so catch us up.

1346
01:21:58.965 --> 01:22:00.137
What's been going on?

1347
01:22:00.137 --> 01:22:01.931
Tell us about the station.

1348
01:22:01.931 --> 01:22:04.517
Well. it's a lot more work.

1349
01:22:04.517 --> 01:22:07.655
but being promoted to
Chief is a huge honor.

1350
01:22:10.344 --> 01:22:12.448
Are you guys gonna
drink that in front of me?

1351
01:22:12.448 --> 01:22:14.896
Ah. come on. we can
give you a little whiff.

1352
01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.000
Oh. thank you.

1353
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.517
Yeah. yeah. great.

1354
01:22:17.517 --> 01:22:19.413
Oh. did you see
today's headline?

1355
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:23.827
Oh my God. everything
happened so fast.

1356
01:22:23.827 --> 01:22:25.448
It doesn't seem real.

1357
01:22:25.448 --> 01:22:27.413
Please. after all
that's happened.

1358
01:22:27.413 --> 01:22:29.827
he was a strain
on the department.

1359
01:22:29.827 --> 01:22:31.413
They were happy to wrap that up.

1360
01:22:32.931 --> 01:22:34.034
And I don't know
if I ever told you.

1361
01:22:34.034 --> 01:22:36.206
but in the middle of all this.

1362
01:22:36.206 --> 01:22:38.862
I thought it was you that
was behind everything.

1363
01:22:38.862 --> 01:22:42.000
I could have swore I was gonna
see your face on the news.

1364
01:22:43.689 --> 01:22:45.275
Yeah. well. if you think
she's scandalous now.

1365
01:22:45.275 --> 01:22:46.862
you should have seen
her in high school.

1366
01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:49.103
And I plead the fifth.

1367
01:22:49.103 --> 01:22:51.827
You better
plead the fifth.

1368
01:22:51.827 --> 01:22:53.655
So how far along are you?

1369
01:22:53.655 --> 01:22:56.241
Ah. second trimester.

1370
01:22:56.241 --> 01:22:59.068
You think the third time
around would be easier. but no.

1371
01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:03.103
That's why I'm happy
I got my girl back.

1372
01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.655
She's gonna help me
out with the other two

1373
01:23:04.655 --> 01:23:06.931
while I go back to teaching.

1374
01:23:06.931 --> 01:23:07.724
Yay!

1375
01:23:09.413 --> 01:23:11.034
You know what you're having?

1376
01:23:12.413 --> 01:23:14.550
A boy.

1377
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:18.379
Well. ain't that something?

1378
01:23:19.379 --> 01:23:20.793
It is.

1379
01:23:20.793 --> 01:23:22.275
So when is the baby shower?

1380
01:23:22.275 --> 01:23:23.585
'Cause that's what
I'm talking about.

1381
01:23:23.585 --> 01:23:26.000
How about a destination
baby shower?

1382
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.241
I'm talking Cabo.

1383
01:23:27.241 --> 01:23:29.758
