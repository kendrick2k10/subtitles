Will you just hurry up?

-Well. how do you know it works?
-I don't.

16
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.312
That's why you're going in
and I'm keeping watch.

Matt. I'm not going
in that house!

Ten grand.
Think about it.

19
00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:33.319

I paid for the mask.
It's on you.

[panting] No. he fell...
he fell in like a hole.

51
00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.831
I saw him.

A developing situation. not

is an officer shot.

72
00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:18.137
or there is a need to get
people to emergency care...

We can't go back there.

92
00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:35.948
When Ms. Dillard gets home.
she'll see she got robbed.

93
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:37.683
She'll call the cops.

94

I thought I
was trapped down here.

108

I was chasing some kids
and then I fell.
I think I broke my ankle.

-Oh. yeah?

174
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.430
You're the oldest. Matt.
She knows you push me around.

175
00:14:25.463 --> 00:14:26.899
You'll get in the most trouble.

176
00:14:29.634 --> 00:14:31.403
Fuck.

177
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.639
You're such a girl.

178
00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:37.376
We need to help him.

179
00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:39.078
We could take him some water.

180
00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:42.314
Fine.

181
00:14:46.184 --> 00:14:47.620
We don't show our faces.

182
00:14:56.728 --> 00:14:58.697
You made this whole thing up.
didn't you?

183
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.432
I'm telling you.
he was in the hole.

184
00:15:00.465 --> 00:15:02.100
Yeah? He better be.
‘cause if he's not...

185
00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:03.702
[Hamby groaning]

186
00:15:03.735 --> 00:15:07.172
-Oh. shit!
-See?

187
00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:09.942
-Hey. Mr. Hamby? It's me.
-[Hamby] Oh!

188
00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:12.278
Hey. you're back.
Did you bring the police?

189
00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:16.281
They're on their way.
My mom called them.

190
00:15:16.314 --> 00:15:17.549
I brought you some water.

191
00:15:20.118 --> 00:15:22.120
[Hamby] Ah! Ow!

192
00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:24.189
I'm sorry. I dropped it!
Why would you do that?

193
00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:27.559
It's okay!
Thanks. I got it.

194
00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:31.063
We checked on him.
He's fine. Let's go.

195
00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:33.966
He's not fine. He's still stuck.
We need to tell someone.

196
00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.336
Is someone up there with you?

197
00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:39.304
No. It's just me.

198
00:15:39.337 --> 00:15:42.274
Oh. Yeah. Come closer.

199
00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:45.510
-I want to see you.
-Yeah. Sure.

200
00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:47.746
What did you say your name
was again? Matt?

201
00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:51.516
-You told him my name?
-It just slipped out!

202
00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:53.652
I can hear you talking
to somebody up there.

203
00:15:53.685 --> 00:15:55.487
-No. I said I was alone.
-Yeah. but you're not.

204
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.356
I can hear you.
It's another boy.

205
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.360
[sighs]

206
00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.629
You're the two kids
I was chasing.

207
00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:12.304
Yeah. there's someone
else here all right.

208
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.743
My name is David Hamby.
and I need your help.

209
00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:22.381
What are you two. brothers?

210
00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.082
[Matt] What's it to you?

211
00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:26.651
Look. I'm not gonna snitch.
Okay?

212
00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:28.487
I don't care what you guys
were up to.

213
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.722
What do you think
we were up to?

214
00:16:30.755 --> 00:16:34.059
Playing tag? I don't know.
I'll say whatever you want.

215
00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:38.063
How do we know
you'll keep your word?

216
00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:40.232
Look. I was a kid once too.
all right?

217
00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.500
I know what it's like.

218
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.670
Let me and my brother talk.

219
00:16:45.703 --> 00:16:48.607
Hey. We can save him.
We can do this.

220
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.742
I bet he saw you sneaking
out of Ms. Dillard's house.

221
00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:53.345
Twenty years in jail.
Think about it.

222
00:16:53.378 --> 00:16:56.114
Let's tell Ma. okay?
This is too big for you and me.
She'll know what to do.

223
00:16:56.147 --> 00:16:57.649
We can't tell Ma we robbed
Ms. Dillard. Are you nuts?

224
00:16:57.682 --> 00:16:59.451
-[Hamby] Guys?
-Shut up!

225
00:16:59.484 --> 00:17:01.086
We're still talking.

226
00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:02.554
Let's just make
an anonymous phone call.

227
00:17:02.587 --> 00:17:04.689
There's a payphone
on Quigley at the 7-11.

228
00:17:04.722 --> 00:17:06.758
Mr. Hamby will sing like
Tweety Bird when he's safe.

229
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:09.161
But. Matt. he knows our faces.

230
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:11.596
It'll be worse if someone else
helps him and we don't.

231
00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:14.366
Maybe no one will help him.

232
00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.235
That could work too.

233
00:17:17.402 --> 00:17:19.204
Boys. come on. please!

234
00:17:19.237 --> 00:17:21.606
-I said shut up!
-I'm in a lot of pain!

235
00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:23.842
-Goddamn it! Shut up!
-Matt. don't yell at him.

236
00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.578
How hard is it to fetch
a grown-up. you stupid brats?

237
00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:29.281
-I'll show you
exactly how hard it is.
-Matt. stop!

238
00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:37.389
-Jesus. Matt!
-No! No! Ah!

239
00:17:37.422 --> 00:17:42.127
Goddamn it! Fuck you!

240
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.163
I'm in charge now.
and I said shut up!

241
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.598
Are you're crazy?
He'll hate us now.

242
00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:47.866
-He already hated us.
-No. he didn't.

243
00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:49.134
Why would you do that?

244
00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:51.503
Because it worked. Listen.

245
00:17:55.173 --> 00:17:57.643
Some people only
understand a harsh hand.

246
00:17:59.811 --> 00:18:01.346
It's like Dad always said.

247
00:18:04.182 --> 00:18:06.184
That man
is someone else's problem.

248
00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:08.387
Not mine. and not yours either.

249
00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:14.526
I'm sorry. Mr. Hamby!

250
00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:46.358
[TV plays indistinctly]

251
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.336
[Mother]
It's cold outside. baby.

252
00:18:58.369 --> 00:19:02.574
-The TV says 43.
-Yeah.

253
00:19:02.607 --> 00:19:05.444
Can you fetch me a diet soda?

254
00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:07.679
Sure. Ma.

255
00:19:10.815 --> 00:19:13.719
What's wrong? Are we out?

256
00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.722
-No.
-Oh. good.

257
00:19:17.755 --> 00:19:20.492
Could you fetch me
a glass with some ice too?

258
00:19:20.525 --> 00:19:22.594
Yeah.

259
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.266
-[TV continues indistinct]
-[sighs]

260
00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:29.668
What a world.

261
00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:48.187
Mr. Hamby?

262
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.622
It's me. The nice one.

263
00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:55.360
My real name's Joey.
Matt's my brother.

264
00:19:57.395 --> 00:19:58.931
I brought you some food.

265
00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:04.469
Mr. Hamby. Are you asleep?

266
00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:13.879
Your brother
pissed on my face.

267
00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:17.482
Yeah. I know. Sorry.

268
00:20:19.984 --> 00:20:21.286
I brought you some food. though.

269
00:20:21.319 --> 00:20:23.855
I brought a bologna sandwich.

270
00:20:23.888 --> 00:20:26.992
uh. chips and a soda pop.

271
00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:28.594
Okay. Toss it down.

272
00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:39.238
Does your brother
know you're here?

273
00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.642
Yeah. I didn't think so.

274
00:20:50.014 --> 00:20:52.917
So. Joey. are you gonna help me?

275
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.254
Seems like we
got a standoff here.

276
00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:58.823
Yeah. You know. um.

277
00:20:58.856 --> 00:21:00.725
my brother doesn't trust you.

278
00:21:00.758 --> 00:21:02.694
He thinks that you're
gonna get us in trouble.

279
00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:07.966
Well. you don't have to do
everything your brother says.

280
00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.402
-How old is he?
-Seventeen.

281
00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:12.737
-And you're what. 15?
-In three months.

282
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.674
Well. you're old enough
to stand up to him.

283
00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.047
You seem like a good kid.

284
00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:26.318
You go to church. Joey?

285
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.752
I mean.
I don't get there every Sunday.

286
00:21:27.785 --> 00:21:30.055
But you believe in God. right?

287
00:21:32.056 --> 00:21:35.927
-Yeah.
-Yeah. so do I.

288
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.331
That's why you gotta
do the right thing.

289
00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.600
You gotta do
the Christian thing.

290
00:21:43.434 --> 00:21:46.071
Oh. God!

291
00:21:48.072 --> 00:21:50.875
Oh. my leg
hurts something awful.

292
00:21:50.908 --> 00:21:52.778
I can get you some
of my mom's painkillers.

293
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:55.947
I can't stay down here forever.

294
00:21:56.881 --> 00:21:59.017
I know. I just...

295
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.953
-I need some time to think.
-Think about what?

296
00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:05.724
No. you gotta take charge.
Gotta step up.

297
00:22:06.524 --> 00:22:08.360
I know. I should.

298
00:22:10.528 --> 00:22:14.333
Are you more afraid of your
brother than you are of God?

299
00:22:16.701 --> 00:22:18.870
I was afraid of my brother.

300
00:22:18.903 --> 00:22:21.773
He once kicked a basketball
in my face. broke my nose.

301
00:22:21.806 --> 00:22:23.608
That sounds like
something Matt would do.

302
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:25.110
[chuckles]

303
00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:26.845
You have a sister?

304
00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:30.849
No. Just me and Matt. You?

305
00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:32.951
I had one.

306
00:22:33.918 --> 00:22:35.554
She died in a car wreck.

307
00:22:38.723 --> 00:22:41.626
-You love your mom. Joey?
-Of course.

308
00:22:42.593 --> 00:22:44.429
Yeah.

309
00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:46.031
I love my mom too.

310
00:22:47.765 --> 00:22:51.636
But. if you leave me
to die down here.

311
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.706
how's she gonna feel?

312
00:22:54.739 --> 00:22:56.775
She'd be sad. I guess.

313
00:22:56.808 --> 00:22:58.377
Real sad.

314
00:23:00.711 --> 00:23:04.049
She'd be all alone.
except for my brother.

315
00:23:05.716 --> 00:23:08.453
and we've already determined
he's kind of an asshole.

316
00:23:08.486 --> 00:23:10.722
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

317
00:23:11.856 --> 00:23:14.492
See. Joey? Help me out.

318
00:23:14.525 --> 00:23:17.962
Don't let the assholes win.

319
00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:21.166
I was so scared of you
at first. though.
When you were chasing us.

320
00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:24.002
I know. I was scared too.

321
00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:27.639
-I didn't think there
was anyone else around.
-Me neither.

322
00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:34.512
Hey. You know. if you don't want
to call a policeman.

323
00:23:34.545 --> 00:23:36.815
is there another
grown-up you could call?

324
00:23:39.784 --> 00:23:42.787
Or maybe you just get a rope

325
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.959
and I could pull myself out.
you know.
if you tied it to a tree.

326
00:23:47.992 --> 00:23:49.961
I don't think that's
a good idea. Not yet.

327
00:23:51.195 --> 00:23:53.765
-You know. I gotta go.
-No!

328
00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:55.834
I mean. wait.

329
00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:58.236
Please. I...

330
00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:00.972
-I like talking to you.
-I'll be back tonight.

331
00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:03.775
I'll bring you a dinner
and some... some blankets.

332
00:24:03.808 --> 00:24:06.845
-Okay. Call someone.
-I will.

333
00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:11.049
Joey? Joey?

334
00:24:13.684 --> 00:24:15.987
Joey!

335
00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:27.265
[Joey] I think they're
taking the tent off.

336
00:24:27.298 --> 00:24:31.269
I want to see if they
notice the broken window

337
00:24:31.302 --> 00:24:33.004
and if they call the cops.

338
00:24:35.773 --> 00:24:38.009
[Matt] Guess they're
leaving it on longer.

339
00:24:38.042 --> 00:24:41.146
They sometimes do that
if the infestation's bad.

340
00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:45.917
Matt?
Do you believe in God?

341
00:24:49.153 --> 00:24:51.589
Sure I do.

342
00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:54.092
Me and God made a deal

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.971
I'm just tired.

516
00:36:51.441 --> 00:36:53.544
[sighs] The news is back on.

517
00:36:59.983 --> 00:37:03.387
So I booked a room
at the Red Carpet Inn tonight.

518
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.623
Gonna go party with
Tom Chowdee and some girls.

519
00:37:08.825 --> 00:37:11.862
You can come if you want.
Peace offering.

520
00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:15.032
Tom's got beers.

521
00:37:15.065 --> 00:37:17.635
-Pass.
-Oh. yeah?

522
00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:20.304
I don't want to go anywhere
with you ever again.

523
00:37:20.337 --> 00:37:21.505
Good.

524
00:37:22.906 --> 00:37:24.909
I didn't want you
to come anyway.

525
00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:29.380
Ah!

526
00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.815
-Clean up on aisle pussy.
-You know what? Maybe I will go.

527
00:37:31.848 --> 00:37:33.384
Especially if you
don't want me to.

528
00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.953
Party starts at nine.

529
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:10.788
[indistinct chatter]

530
00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.940
-Hey there. bud.
-What's up. Tom?

531
00:38:29.973 --> 00:38:32.343
-You know. Matt's upstairs.
-All right.

532
00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:35.646
-Hey. take a hit.
-No. I don't... I'm good.

533
00:38:35.679 --> 00:38:37.414
Do it.

534
00:38:37.447 --> 00:38:40.718
-Is this your first time?
-No.

535
00:38:44.888 --> 00:38:46.924
-[coughing]
-[laughs]

536
00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:50.861
-[continues coughing]
-Hey. you're all right
by me. bud.

537
00:38:50.894 --> 00:38:52.696
Nice work
on Ms. Dillard's place.

538
00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:55.899
-Matt told me everything.
-He did?

539
00:38:55.932 --> 00:39:00.104
[coughs] Of course he did.
Who do you think is paying
for this party?

540
00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:02.740
It ain't me.
I'm stone broke.

541
00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.485
-[loud rock music plays]
-[indistinct chatter]

542
00:39:23.059 --> 00:39:24.428
You came!

543
00:39:27.063 --> 00:39:28.933
Now drink like a fish.

544
00:39:30.467 --> 00:39:31.668
Matt. who's paying
for all this?

545
00:39:31.701 --> 00:39:33.670
What the fuck
does it matter?

546
00:39:33.703 --> 00:39:35.939
You're paying for it. aren't
you. with the money we stole?

547
00:39:35.972 --> 00:39:38.409
-For a stupid party?
-Naw.

548
00:39:40.043 --> 00:39:41.645
Well. maybe a little.

549
00:39:41.678 --> 00:39:43.046
You said the money
was for Ma's medical bills.

550
00:39:43.079 --> 00:39:44.882
There's enough to go around.

551
00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.017
-Not if you waste it all.
-What. you got an MBA now?

552
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.053
-We owed Tom Chowdee
for the tip.
-This isn't about Tom Chowdee.

553
00:39:50.086 --> 00:39:53.056
This is about girls and pot
and beer and you.

554
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:56.126
And there's something
wrong with that?

555
00:39:56.159 --> 00:39:59.797
Joey. we are gonna
have an amazing time.

556
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.966
-Jesus!
-He ain't here. Joey.

557
00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:06.904
You said the money was for Ma.
It was never for Ma.

558
00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:08.739
It was always for you.

559
00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:12.009
That's not fair!

560
00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.011
Why you gotta bitch and moan?

561
00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:16.180
Don't you like having fun?

562
00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.618
You know where to find me.

563
00:40:23.887 --> 00:40:26.523
She gives head for 20 bucks.
I'll sponsor you.

564
00:40:26.556 --> 00:40:28.659
-Get the fuck off me!
-What's the matter. you gay?

565
00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:32.730
Hey. it's cool. I won't tell.
Dad would be so proud of you.

566
00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:37.201
Matt. you're an idiot
and you're a liar.

567
00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:40.537
And you're gonna
get us both caught.
Dad would regret your existence.

568
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:42.973
Well. Dad's gone.
so I'm all you got left.

569
00:40:43.006 --> 00:40:45.109
You're worse than nothing.

570
00:40:51.181 --> 00:40:52.783
Okay. listen up. everyone!

571
00:40:52.816 --> 00:40:55.486
Music off! Music off!

572
00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.154
[shuts off music]

573
00:40:58.522 --> 00:41:01.058
Okay. listen. Listen.

574
00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:04.228
I got something I wanna say
and it'll only take a sec.

575
00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:07.030
This here's my
baby brother. Joey.

576
00:41:07.063 --> 00:41:09.066
I love my brother.
did you know that?

577
00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:11.535
I'm not even sure that
he knows that. but it's true.

578
00:41:11.568 --> 00:41:13.070
-[girl] Aw.
-But guess what. everyone?

579
00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:15.939
I just heard a story
that my brother

580
00:41:15.972 --> 00:41:18.208
has been robbing from old folks.

581
00:41:18.241 --> 00:41:21.011
What do you think about that?
A dirty thief. My own brother.

582
00:41:21.044 --> 00:41:23.146
[all booing]

583
00:41:23.179 --> 00:41:25.949
-Matt. shut up.
-I heard he's been robbing

584
00:41:25.982 --> 00:41:27.885
from old ladies
who ain't even home!

585
00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:31.121
-Shut up. damn it.
-[booing]

586
00:41:31.154 --> 00:41:33.790
Better get stepping.
Nobody likes a thief.

587
00:41:33.823 --> 00:41:36.126
-[boy 1] Little thief!
-[boy 2] You better
get out of here.

588
00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:40.063
-[all shouting]
-Why don't we show him
what we think of thieves!

589
00:41:40.096 --> 00:41:42.833
He's tougher than that.
He can take more than that.

590
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.669
[all shouting]

591
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.138
Matt killed somebody!

592
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:50.774
Matt killed a man!

593
00:41:50.807 --> 00:41:52.609
And nobody knows it but me.

594
00:41:52.642 --> 00:41:54.678
His name was Mr. Hamby!

595
00:41:55.211 --> 00:41:57.180
David Hamby!

596
00:41:57.213 --> 00:41:59.683
And Matt killed him.

597
00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:01.185
Matt killed him with poison gas!

598
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.557
-[farting sound]
-Now that's some poison gas!

599
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.258
[all laugh]

600
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:10.794
I'm serious.
I swear. I saw him.

601
00:42:11.928 --> 00:42:13.297
I saw it.

602
00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:26.076
[groaning]

603
00:42:36.886 --> 00:42:39.756
-Matt. what the fuck?
-Why the fuck would you
say that about me?

604
00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:42.192
Huh? A killer?

605
00:42:43.326 --> 00:42:46.196
I didn't ask
to be put in charge.

606
00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:48.031
-I'm just trying
to have a good time.
-No. you're not!

607
00:42:48.064 --> 00:42:50.000
You're trying
to get me in trouble!

608
00:42:50.033 --> 00:42:51.635
You're trying to frame me for
robbing Ms. Dillard's place!

609
00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:54.271
You're such an ungrateful
fuckin' dick!

610
00:42:54.304 --> 00:42:55.839
Aren't you?

611
00:42:58.108 --> 00:43:00.611
-Matt. stop!
-Pretty easy
to get hurt out here.

612
00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:02.980
You wanna be careful
spreading rumors.

613
00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.082
As soon as I get home.
I'm gonna tell Ma everything!

614
00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:11.221
You're not telling Ma.

615
00:43:11.254 --> 00:43:13.123
Think about the consequences.

616
00:43:13.156 --> 00:43:14.691
Huh?

617
00:43:14.724 --> 00:43:17.361
Ma being so frail and all.

618
00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:20.898
Bad things happen
to weak people.

619
00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:23.934
Just look at Dad.

620
00:43:26.436 --> 00:43:29.773
Ah. fuck! [groans. sobs]

621
00:43:29.806 --> 00:43:31.275
Get up. Joe.

622
00:43:33.209 --> 00:43:35.746
I said get up.

623
00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.314
Look at what
you've done now. hm?

624
00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:39.149
-[sobbing]
-Hm?

625
00:43:39.182 --> 00:43:40.951
You should face it.

626
00:43:42.385 --> 00:43:44.788
I'll always
be one step ahead of you.

627
00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:49.726
[whooping]

628
00:43:49.759 --> 00:43:51.228
Whoo!

629
00:43:52.962 --> 00:43:55.833
-Ahh!
-[yelps]

630
00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:06.276
[door opens]

631
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:07.778
-[door slams]
-Joey. can you--

632
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.047
Get your own damn soda!

633
00:44:10.947 --> 00:44:13.384
Someone's in a mood.

634
00:44:17.887 --> 00:44:19.990
I wasn't even gonna
ask you for a soda.

635
00:44:20.023 --> 00:44:22.359
I was... just gonna say.

636
00:44:22.392 --> 00:44:26.229
"Can you come and sit
down a spell?" But...

637
00:44:26.262 --> 00:44:28.899
maybe you need to be left alone.

638
00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:48.385
Are you okay. baby?

639
00:44:49.986 --> 00:44:51.255
Yeah.

640
00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:58.028
-Matt's giving you grief again.
isn't he?
-No.

641
00:44:58.061 --> 00:45:00.197
He hasn't been the same
since Daddy died.

642
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.233
Sure he has. Mom.
but it's just gotten worse.

643
00:45:06.803 --> 00:45:09.173
I don't have the strength
to deal with him.

644
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.810
[sighs]
Not like a mother should.

645
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.279
That's okay. Ma.

646
00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:20.117
You know.
as bad as your daddy was...

647
00:45:22.552 --> 00:45:25.355
some days I wish
he was still here.

648
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.040
I'm sorry. Joey.

649
00:45:46.242 --> 00:45:48.345
I know. Ma.

650
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.352
If you ever need to talk...

651
00:45:56.252 --> 00:45:57.954
here I am. okay.

652
00:45:57.987 --> 00:45:59.757
You know that. right?

653
00:46:00.356 --> 00:46:02.059
Yeah.

654
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.799
Look.

655
00:46:10.233 --> 00:46:14.805
-A murderer's on the loose.
-A murderer?

656
00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.907
Yeah. they've been
showing his face all day.

657
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.478
He shot his wife
and kids in Raleigh.

658
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:23.346
He was spotted around here.

659
00:46:23.379 --> 00:46:26.316
"Armed and dangerous"
is what they say.

660
00:46:28.084 --> 00:46:30.086
He doesn't have
the jaw line of a killer.

661
00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:33.557
but you can never tell
until it's too late.

662
00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:38.428
His name
is Randy Michael Sadler.

663
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:40.197
Holy shit!

664
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.367
He shot his whole family.
Blew their brains out.

665
00:46:44.367 --> 00:46:47.204
I guess he just snapped.

666
00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:49.173
like people do.

667
00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:51.942
Baby?

668
00:46:52.909 --> 00:46:54.177
-Holy shit.
-Baby!

669
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.213
I wasn't trying to scare you.

670
00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.281
I just want to keep you safe.

671
00:46:58.314 --> 00:47:02.352
Fuck! Holy fuck.
Holy fuck. Holy shit.

672
00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.889
Jesus!

673
00:47:05.922 --> 00:47:07.891
Jesus! Jesus!

674
00:47:07.924 --> 00:47:10.828
[static on walkie]

675
00:47:13.162 --> 00:47:15.833
[static on walkie]

676
00:47:17.533 --> 00:47:19.569
[Hamby] Joey.

677
00:47:19.602 --> 00:47:22.272
Joey. Are you there?

678
00:47:22.305 --> 00:47:24.875
Over.

679
00:47:37.086 --> 00:47:38.989
Mr. Hamby?

680
00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:43.126
[Hamby]
You forgot to say... "over."

681
00:47:45.995 --> 00:47:48.966
You're... you're alive?

682
00:47:49.565 --> 00:47:51.134
Over.

683
00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:53.370
[Hamby] Your brother...

684
00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:56.973
Was that... poison?

685
00:47:57.006 --> 00:47:59.643
From Ms. Dillard's
termite house.

686
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.346
My lungs hurt...

687
00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:05.649
and my eyes aren't right.

688
00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:07.517
It's time.

689
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.319
Get me out of here.

690
00:48:10.353 --> 00:48:12.222
No more excuses.

691
00:48:13.256 --> 00:48:17.561
-Mr. Hamby?
-Yeah?

692
00:48:19.395 --> 00:48:21.298
I know who you really are.

693
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:28.105
Joey...

694
00:48:29.472 --> 00:48:31.375
Come see me in the morning.

695
00:49:04.774 --> 00:49:06.510
How come you're still alive?

696
00:49:12.715 --> 00:49:15.552
You dropped this
when I was chasing you.

697
00:49:20.256 --> 00:49:22.058
You saved my life.

698
00:49:22.091 --> 00:49:24.761
Why were you chasing us?
You're gonna hurt us?

699
00:49:24.794 --> 00:49:27.230
I saw you robbing the place.

700
00:49:27.263 --> 00:49:29.333
I was gonna take what you stole.

701
00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:33.403
Things didn't
go according to plan.

702
00:49:33.436 --> 00:49:36.306
So I guess I should call you
Randy from now on.

703
00:49:38.574 --> 00:49:40.110
Hey. Joey.

704
00:49:42.445 --> 00:49:44.414
How did your dad die?

705
00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.449
I never asked you.

706
00:49:46.482 --> 00:49:49.486
-He got shot.
-Shot?

707
00:49:52.288 --> 00:49:55.125
He was drunk and. um.

708
00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:58.294
messed with the wrong person.

709
00:49:58.327 --> 00:50:01.498
He had cancer anyway.
Lung cancer. [sniffs]

710
00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:03.200
My mom got it too.

711
00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:07.237
Tough draw.

712
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.639
Both my folks died
in a car wreck.

713
00:50:09.672 --> 00:50:11.208
Just like your sister?

714
00:50:13.476 --> 00:50:15.112
Yeah.

715
00:50:16.679 --> 00:50:18.181
Just like her. Joey.

716
00:50:18.214 --> 00:50:20.150
You never even
had a sister. did you?

717
00:50:25.321 --> 00:50:26.723
Why didn't you ever
tell me your real name?

718
00:50:26.756 --> 00:50:29.126
Same reason you
didn't tell me yours.

719
00:50:30.793 --> 00:50:32.596
So is it true?

720
00:50:35.364 --> 00:50:37.501
You know. what they said
about you in the news?

721
00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:42.672
Well. it probably went down

722
00:50:42.705 --> 00:50:44.641
a little different
than they said it did.

723
00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:48.144
Why'd you want me to call
the cops? There's a manhunt.

724
00:50:48.177 --> 00:50:50.047
Well. maybe I had a plan.

725
00:50:52.448 --> 00:50:55.185
They said that you...
you killed your family.

726
00:50:56.486 --> 00:51:00.223
Your wife and your two kids.
eight and ten.

727
00:51:00.256 --> 00:51:02.659
Then you burned your house down.

728
00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.794
What do you think
about that. Joey?

729
00:51:04.827 --> 00:51:06.563
[Joey] Why were you wearing
a security guard outfit?

730
00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:10.366
They say you work
at a tire factory.

731
00:51:10.399 --> 00:51:12.836
[chuckles]
How about that?

732
00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.671
A tire factory.

733
00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:17.274
Why can't you just
give me a straight answer?

734
00:51:19.308 --> 00:51:22.846
Maybe I ran into a security
guard and stole his clothes.

735
00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:26.516
Desperate men
do desperate things.

736
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.487
So do you still want me
to call the cops?

737
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.322
Oh...

738
00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:35.625
It's a bit more challenging
now that I'm all over the news.

739
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.596
But if you were to get a rope.

740
00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:42.432
I wouldn't say no.

741
00:51:42.465 --> 00:51:45.168
Tie it to a tree.
I could climb out.

742
00:51:46.469 --> 00:51:47.704
You know. I could turn you in.

743
00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.306
I bet there's big reward money.

744
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.375
I bet there is.

745
00:51:53.776 --> 00:51:56.279
But you're not gonna do that.
are you. Joey?

746
00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.254
[groans]

747
00:52:06.722 --> 00:52:08.425
Now. go get that rope.

748
00:52:09.692 --> 00:52:12.228
There's a rope in the garage.
I can get it.

749
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:13.863
Good man.

750
00:52:13.896 --> 00:52:17.600
Bring it here quick.
We're running out of time.

751
00:52:17.633 --> 00:52:19.236
First I got a question.

752
00:52:20.236 --> 00:52:22.405
Actually. it's more of a...

753
00:52:22.438 --> 00:52:23.773
a favor than a question.

754
00:52:23.806 --> 00:52:26.709
-Hit me.
-If I get you that rope

755
00:52:26.742 --> 00:52:29.179
and help you out...

756
00:52:32.815 --> 00:52:35.318
will you come back to the house
and punish Matt for me?

757
00:52:37.453 --> 00:52:39.623
-Joey?
-Yes. Randy?

758
00:52:41.357 --> 00:52:43.260
It would be my delight.

759
00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:51.634
[indistinct shouting]

760
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:54.771
All you do pop pills
and watch TV all day!

761
00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:57.407
Don't you rag my ass
about how I live!

762
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.576
[sobbing]
I'm worried about you!

763
00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:02.378
The manager of Red Carper Inn
called and said...

764
00:53:02.411 --> 00:53:04.314
Screw that guy. he's lying!

765
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.516
-...you and Tom Chowdee...
-I've never been in that dump!

766
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:08.552
-...threw a party
and wrecked a room.
-Hey. Matt!

767
00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.987
Mom!

768
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.856
[Mother] Go up to your room.
Lock the door.

769
00:53:13.889 --> 00:53:15.858
Stop talking about me
like I'm not even in here!

770
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:17.860
He's been stealing
my pain pills too.

771
00:53:17.893 --> 00:53:20.630
-No. you're fuckin' lying!
-Matt. stop!

772
00:53:20.663 --> 00:53:22.832
-Not my TV!
-Matt. Matt. Matt!

773
00:53:22.865 --> 00:53:26.669
Okay. I was taking
your pain pills. That was me.
I was taking them.

774
00:53:26.702 --> 00:53:28.738
-What? You?
-That was me.

775
00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:32.542
You? Why?

776
00:53:32.575 --> 00:53:35.278
-I... I was bored.
-Why?

777
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:37.314
-Time for rehab.
-Shut up!

778
00:53:39.715 --> 00:53:42.586
[sobbing] I feel so helpless
with you boys.

779
00:53:43.419 --> 00:53:45.688
[sobbing] Baby. can...

780
00:53:45.721 --> 00:53:48.558
-Can you get me a diet soda?
-Sure. Ma.

781
00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.396
You two make me sick.

782
00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:56.633
Baby. Ma! Baby. Ma!

783
00:53:57.767 --> 00:54:00.403
-Fuck it.
-[clattering]

784
00:54:00.436 --> 00:54:02.239
I hate this place.

785
00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.843
I'll get you that soda. Ma.

786
00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:09.412
I'm helping you clean up. okay?

787
00:54:34.036 --> 00:54:38.375
-Here. baby. [groans]
-It's okay. Ma.

788
00:55:22.518 --> 00:55:24.787
-[Randy] That you. Joey?
-Yeah. I got the rope.

789
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:27.557
Okay. Good man.

790
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.991
[Joey] Yeah.
this might take a while.

791
00:55:29.024 --> 00:55:32.562
That's okay.
Take your time and do it right.

792
00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:35.431
Tie it around the nearest tree.

793
00:55:35.464 --> 00:55:37.700
Do you know how
to make a clove hitch?

794
00:55:37.733 --> 00:55:40.937
-My dad taught me.
-All right.
Make sure it's tight.

795
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.773
It's got to support
all of my weight.

796
00:55:43.806 --> 00:55:46.009
-Oh. it'll hold.
-Okay.

797
00:55:55.651 --> 00:55:59.589
-Okay. here it comes.
-All right. There we go.

798
00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:03.360
Good. Come on. Little further.

799
00:56:04.727 --> 00:56:05.895
Got it!

800
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:10.100
All right. Joey. stand back.

801
00:56:12.101 --> 00:56:15.505
[grunting]

802
00:56:23.579 --> 00:56:27.083
[panting. grunting]

803
00:56:27.116 --> 00:56:29.386
Pull me up. Pull me up.

804
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.827
[moans. sighs]

805
00:56:38.994 --> 00:56:40.563
Oh. wow.

806
00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:47.837
Get me a branch for a cane.

807
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:51.007
-Otherwise I'm no good
for walking.
-Okay.

808
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.877
[sighs. pants]

809
00:56:56.078 --> 00:56:58.148
I forgot what freedom was.

810
00:57:04.086 --> 00:57:06.689
[groans]

811
00:57:11.193 --> 00:57:13.596
Okay. Help me up.

812
00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:16.599
[moans] Okay.

813
00:57:19.835 --> 00:57:22.071
-You okay?
-Yeah.

814
00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:24.874
Ow!

815
00:57:27.676 --> 00:57:30.180
[sighs. pants]

816
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:34.784
-Sorry about this. Joey.
-Sorry about what?

817
00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.458
[panting]

818
00:57:42.858 --> 00:57:46.596
Randy? Have you had that gun
in the hole the entire time?

819
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.898
It didn't do me
much good in the hole.

820
00:57:50.065 --> 00:57:51.935
Different story outside.

821
00:57:53.969 --> 00:57:57.006
Are... are you gonna shoot me?

822
00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.213
Nah.

823
00:58:08.617 --> 00:58:10.820
Here. [sniffs]

824
00:58:10.853 --> 00:58:11.988
You take it.

825
00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.723
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

826
00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:15.492
You might like the feel.

827
00:58:18.193 --> 00:58:20.863
I wish I had two.

828
00:58:20.896 --> 00:58:22.665
I'd take you hunting.

829
00:58:23.165 --> 00:58:24.834
Teach you.

830
00:58:25.701 --> 00:58:27.203
Like your daddy wanted.

831
00:58:29.738 --> 00:58:31.107
Go on. then.

832
00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:36.779
-Is it loaded?
-It's loaded. Safety's off.

833
00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:39.949
You could shoot a man.

834
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.553
[imitates gunshots]

835
00:58:47.122 --> 00:58:49.893
-[imitates gunshots]
-Looks good on you.

836
00:59:00.736 --> 00:59:02.872
Police are looking for you
in five states.

837
00:59:04.773 --> 00:59:06.543
Five states. huh?

838
00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.778
That's big.

839
00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.947
You shot your family
and that's all you can say?

840
00:59:12.681 --> 00:59:14.784
Sometimes...

841
00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:19.221
That doesn't matter now.

842
00:59:19.254 --> 00:59:20.857
It matters to me.

843
00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.996
You better give me
that gun back.

844
00:59:40.275 --> 00:59:42.111
Tell me what you
were going to say.

845
00:59:44.279 --> 00:59:46.316
Sometimes...

846
00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:51.921
you wish you could
go back in time.

847

Before life knocked
your knees out.

848
00:59:59.194 --> 01:00:03.366
-I should shoot you right now.
-Probably so.

849
01:00:14.176 --> 01:00:15.378
Take your gun.

850
01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:22.251
Take me to your house.

851
01:00:22.284 --> 01:00:24.654
I'm gonna need cash and a car.

852
01:00:26.188 --> 01:00:28.224
And we'll settle
that score with your brother.

853
01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:31.127
Right.

854
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.430
Let's just scare him. though.
all right? Don't hurt him.

855
01:00:34.463 --> 01:00:36.098
Exactly.

[indistinct

857
01:00:57.286 --> 01:01:00.756
Just let me do
the talking. all right?
She saw you on the news.

858
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:02.659
Fair enough.

859
01:01:04.226 --> 01:01:07.096
-Hey. Ma.
-Baby.

860
01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:09.966
-Can you fetch me a diet soda?
-Not today.

You're...

01:01:22.277 --> 01:01:25.247
you're Randy Michael Sadler.

-From the TV!
-Don't worry.

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:31.087
I'm not gonna hurt you.

865
01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.156
Go sit on the couch by your mom.

866
01:01:35.357 --> 01:01:38.494
-Baby...
-It's okay. Ma. It's okay.

867
01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:40.429
He's not gonna hurt us.

868
01:01:40.462 --> 01:01:43.332
-Is Matt home?
-Oh. no. no.

869
01:01:43.365 --> 01:01:45.068
He's... he's out.

870
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.776
You take whatever you need
and you get out.

871
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:56.178
Just don't hurt my boy.

872
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:58.114
Your boys have some money.

873
01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:00.249
And Joey said there's
a car I can use?

874
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.353
In the... in the garage.

875
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.289
Their daddy's old truck.

876
01:02:07.322 --> 01:02:10.793
All right.
I'll get out of your hair soon.

877
01:02:10.826 --> 01:02:13.229
-I'm sorry about this. ma'am.
-You should be.

878
01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:16.799
-Your mom have a cell phone?
-No.

879
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.337
Grab that phone so
she doesn't call the cops.

880
01:02:22.504 --> 01:02:24.941
Get me some fresh clothes
and a towel.

881
01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.543
Meet me by the car.

882
01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:30.179
-Sure. Randy.
-You're on his side?

883
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.150
-It's complicated.
-Baby!

884
01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.419
Just don't move
'cause he might shoot you.

885
01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.522
Also. you still want
that diet soda?

886
01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:41.491
Not right now.

887
01:02:42.057 --> 01:02:43.926
Okay.

888
01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:48.498
Excuse me.
Officer Friendly?

889
01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:53.469
-You lost. son?
-No such luck.

890
01:02:53.502 --> 01:02:57.373
-Well. we're working here.
-I need to talk to you
about Ms. Dillard's place.

891
01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.476
You know something
about that broken window?

892
01:03:00.509 --> 01:03:02.111
I sure do.

893
01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:03.579
And it's more
than just a broken window.

894
01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:05.915
Yeah? Hey. Crane.

895
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.451
What's going on?

896
01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:11.554
I saw this kid the other day
sneak into this house.

897
01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.455
right through the termite tent.

898
01:03:13.488 --> 01:03:16.425
Came out with cash
in both his hands. Boats full.

899
01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:18.795
What kid?
You know his name?

900
01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:21.864
His name's Joey.

901
01:03:23.165 --> 01:03:25.368
He lives in my house. He's...

902
01:03:27.169 --> 01:03:28.470
Well. he's my little brother.

903
01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:30.940
-He's your little brother?
-Yes. sir.

904
01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.409
I saw what he stole.
and it was a whole lot.

905
01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.413
I can take you
to the cash if you want.

906
01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.115
You can see for yourself.

907
01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:48.190
It's really never been driven
since your daddy was shot?

908
01:03:48.223 --> 01:03:50.893
My ma's got a car.
but Matt never learned how.

909
01:03:50.926 --> 01:03:53.563
Huh. Well.
I'll tell you one thing.

910
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:57.133
Your dad sure
loved this truck.

911
01:04:00.035 --> 01:04:03.039
-He ever take you riding in it?
-Yeah. sometimes.

912
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.212
-Randy?
-Yep.

913
01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.352
Can you...
can you take me with you?

914
01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.589
Wherever you're going?

915
01:04:21.423 --> 01:04:25.027
Yeah. I knew you were
gonna ask me that.

916
01:04:28.063 --> 01:04:30.199
I'm not planning
on ever coming back here.

917
01:04:30.232 --> 01:04:32.534
And besides.

918
01:04:32.567 --> 01:04:35.238
I don't think your mama
would approve.

919
01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:39.275
Oh. sure she would.

920
01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.610
So I'm the Pied Piper now? Huh?

921
01:04:41.643 --> 01:04:43.279
[chuckles]

922
01:04:46.348 --> 01:04:48.284
If you don't take me with you.

923
01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:50.386
I'll tell the police
everything I know about you.

924
01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:53.088
Everything.

925
01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:55.491
Blackmail. huh?
Say it ain't so. Joe.

926
01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:58.628
-I'm not bluffing!
-[chuckles] I know.

927
01:05:03.598 --> 01:05:06.035
Why don't you come on
and take a ride with me?

928
01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:10.172
-[bangs on truck]
-What about Matt? You promised.

929
01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:14.010
Yeah. We'll find him
along the way. Come on.

930
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:18.047
Just up here.

931
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.916
It's the little
white house on the corner.

932
01:05:22.617 --> 01:05:24.353
Oh. shit. that's my dad's truck.

933
01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:28.123
Hey. wait. wait.
Matt's in that cop car.

934
01:05:28.156 --> 01:05:30.226
Matt's in the back
of that cop car.

935
01:05:32.027 --> 01:05:34.563
What do we do?
What do we do?

936
01:05:37.299 --> 01:05:39.936
[laughs]

937
01:05:41.703 --> 01:05:45.041
Uh... you got me.

938
01:05:49.611 --> 01:05:51.614
-We're gonna be all right. Joey.
-How?

939
01:05:56.218 --> 01:06:00.222
Just put your fingers in your
ears when the shooting starts.

940
01:06:00.255 --> 01:06:03.592
The shooting? The cops might
not know who you are. Randy!

941
01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:07.029
-Wait. wait. wait. You. you--
-Stay in the car.

942
01:06:07.062 --> 01:06:09.098
Fingers in your ears.

943
01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:18.040
-Shit. It's Mr. Hamby
from the hole.
-[Crane] The hole?

944
01:06:18.073 --> 01:06:20.042
This kid don't
make a lick of sense.

945
01:06:20.075 --> 01:06:23.179
-No. you don't understand.
-I gotta check it out.

946
01:06:25.213 --> 01:06:27.583
-How you doing. officer?
-Fucking car. Fuck!

947
01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:30.085
-Let me out of this
fuckin' car right now!
-[Crane] Calm down!

948
01:06:30.118 --> 01:06:32.087
-What is wrong with you?
-Can I help you with something?

949
01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.655
If you don't mind. I'd like to
ask you a couple of questions.

950
01:06:33.688 --> 01:06:36.025
-Oh. yeah.
-I have a guy in the back...

951
01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.326
No! Gun!

952
01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.299
Let me out of this fuckin' car!

953
01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.770
We don't have to do this!

954
01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.572
There's kids around!

955
01:06:51.506 --> 01:06:53.442
-I recognize you!
-I figured you would.

956
01:06:53.475 --> 01:06:55.478
Put down the gun!
I gotta take you in!

957
01:07:00.215 --> 01:07:01.517
Get off the street!

958
01:07:03.752 --> 01:07:05.454
Randy. you shot that cop.

959
01:07:05.487 --> 01:07:09.258
He'll be okay.
He just got to get doctored up.

960
01:07:11.326 --> 01:07:13.829
-That's my brother in your car!
-I said get back inside!

961
01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:16.832
You heard the lady.
That's good advice.

962
01:07:16.865 --> 01:07:19.502
[Crane] Put down the gun
or I'll shoot!

963
01:07:22.404 --> 01:07:25.207
-Jesus Christ. move!
-Hey. hey. hey! Wait!

964
01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.776
You're not gonna take Randy.
All right?
You're not gonna hurt him!

965
01:07:27.809 --> 01:07:29.645
-Get out of the--
-[gunshot]

966
01:07:36.651 --> 01:07:37.686
Stay down!

967
01:07:40.455 --> 01:07:42.358
I'm not worth it.

968
01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.660
Promise.

969
01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.371
[Joey] Randy?

970
01:08:00.542 --> 01:08:03.179
If you weren't here.
they'd be dead.

971
01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:07.216
Take it.

972
01:08:11.386 --> 01:08:14.590
[Matt shouting. banging]
Let me the fuck out of here!

973
01:08:17.192 --> 01:08:20.729
Let me out of this fuckin' car.
Unlock this fuckin' door. Joey.

974
01:08:20.762 --> 01:08:23.666
Unlock the fuckin' door
right now!

975
01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:30.472
Ma'am. I'm gonna
need your car keys.

976
01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:31.640
[Matt] Shit!

977
01:08:34.442 --> 01:08:38.147
All right. Matt.
climb on in.

978
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.883
Joey. get that rope.
toss it in the hole.

979
01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.186
The cops are gonna kill you!

980
01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:46.455
I don't see any cops
around here. Do you?

981
01:08:47.322 --> 01:08:49.525
Joey. Joey. look at me.

982
01:08:59.534 --> 01:09:00.769
Bang!

983
01:09:00.802 --> 01:09:02.371
You flinched.

984
01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:13.849
Get going. Matt. Go on.

985
01:09:16.284 --> 01:09:18.487
-How do I get down?
-Jump.

986
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.402
Fuck!

987
01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.277
-Ah! Fuck! [groans]
-[thuds]

988
01:09:42.777 --> 01:09:45.514
Ow! I hate your guts. Joey!

989
01:09:45.547 --> 01:09:47.282
[laughs]

990
01:09:47.315 --> 01:09:49.485
So what do we do now?

991
01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:52.321
Now?

992
01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.456
Now is your big chance.

993
01:09:54.489 --> 01:09:57.993
-To do what?
-To show him that things
have changed.

994
01:09:58.026 --> 01:09:59.928
That you rule the roost now.

995
01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:01.530
I rule the roost?

996
01:10:01.563 --> 01:10:03.832
Don't tell me. Tell him.

997
01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:10.505
-I rule the roost. Matt.
-Like hell you do!

998
01:10:10.538 --> 01:10:11.907
Come on. louder.

999
01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.508
Put some muscle
behind it. Joey!

1000
01:10:13.541 --> 01:10:16.979
-I rule the roost!
-Go fuck yourself!

1001
01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:18.647
Louder!
He's laughing at you!

1002
01:10:20.582 --> 01:10:22.451
I rule the roost!

1003
01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.453
Look at you! You're nobody!

1004
01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.989
You're as dumb as a brick
and everybody knows it!

1005
01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.890
You're dead meat when I get
out of here. You hear me?

1006
01:10:28.923 --> 01:10:30.626
Tell him things
are different now.

1007
01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.527
You're not gonna
eat his shit anymore.

1008
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.998
He's not the boss anymore!
That you're the man now!

1009
01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.668
-I'm the man now!
-You're the man now!

1010
01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:43.572
I'm the boss to you!
You're down there!
I'm up here! All right?

1011
01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:45.841
I'm the boss!
[panting]

1012
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:51.614
[chuckles]

1013
01:10:55.717 --> 01:10:58.520
-Hand that over.
-I like the feel of that.

1014
01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:01.624
Yeah. I thought you would.

1015
01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:06.395
But... [clears throat]

1016
01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:09.365
I got some bad news.

1017
01:11:10.665 --> 01:11:12.000
What?

1018
01:11:12.033 --> 01:11:13.869
There's only one place
for you to go.

1019
01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.938
Where?

1020
01:11:19.641 --> 01:11:22.644
Down... down there?

1021
01:11:22.677 --> 01:11:24.313
Where else?

1022
01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:27.383
Ha! Send him down to me!
Yeah. send him down!

1023
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:30.085
I can't. I can't go
down there.

1024
01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:31.853
He'll kill me.

1025
01:11:31.886 --> 01:11:34.690
Yeah. That's how
it goes sometimes.

1026
01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:39.061
Or else you learn
to stand up to him and fight.

1027
01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.996
teach him to respect you.

1028
01:11:41.029 --> 01:11:43.799
But he's all riled up.
You made me say those things.

1029
01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:47.035
No. Those things were
inside of you already.

1030
01:11:47.068 --> 01:11:52.040
I can't go down there.
I won't. I can't.
there's no way.

1031
01:11:52.073 --> 01:11:54.677
Okay. Fair enough.

1032
01:11:56.544 --> 01:11:58.080
-Ah!

[muffled sounds]

1037
01:12:48.596 --> 01:12:50.532
[Mother] You.

1038
01:12:58.206 --> 01:12:59.842
Drop your gun.

1039
01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:13.422
Is that all of them?

1040
01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:25.768
How'd you find me?

1041
01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:35.911
[scoffs] GPS.

1042
01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:37.479
[chuckles] Shit.

1043
01:13:38.513 --> 01:13:40.549
Better than a cell phone.

1044
01:13:41.783 --> 01:13:43.051
Where are my boys?

1045
01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:44.786
I had to give them a time out.

1046
01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:47.923
They're in a hole
not far from here.

1047
01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:51.626
-Take me there.
-There's no need.

1048
01:13:51.659 --> 01:13:53.962
You can hear 'em.

1049
01:13:55.129 --> 01:13:56.498
Listen.

Come on. I said get up!
Fight me!

1053
01:14:04.105 --> 01:14:05.974
Fight me!

Mister.

1056
01:14:17.852 --> 01:14:21.857
They say you shot your family.

1057
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.592
And I saw you shoot those cops.

1058
01:14:24.192 --> 01:14:26.028
I can't let you go.

1059
01:14:28.763 --> 01:14:30.799
I've known men like you.

1060
01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:33.568
Violent men.

1061
01:14:33.601 --> 01:14:35.070
My husband was one of 'em.

1062
01:14:36.304 --> 01:14:39.674
Someone shot him. Joey says.

1063
01:14:39.707 --> 01:14:45.113
Someone who got fed up
with his drinking.

1064
01:14:45.146 --> 01:14:47.549
who got fed up
with getting hit.

1065
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:52.220
who got lung cancer

1066
01:14:52.253 --> 01:14:55.657
from his cigarette smoke
when he wouldn't quit.

1067
01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.163
Shit!

1068
01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:03.866

Joey?

1070
01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.610
Joey. you okay?

1071
01:15:15.643 --> 01:15:17.779
I haven't been there
for my boys.

1072
01:15:19.714 --> 01:15:21.884
But I'm here right now.

1073
01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:25.687
Anything I could say
to get out of this?

1074
01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:29.057
We could wait for the cops.

1075
01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:33.962
Nah. they'll just drag it out.

1076
01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:42.204
Don't let those boys down. Okay?

This was too big for you and me.

I just wanted
to take care of things.

1101

I'm sorry.
