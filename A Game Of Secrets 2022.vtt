3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.275
Sport is a reflection
of the world we live in.

4
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.199
And there are a bunch
of nefarious characters.

5
00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.396
There's always something going on.

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.396
Power. politics -

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.916
- money. corruption.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600
The darker recesses of the games.

9
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.796
When you think of a hacker.
you think of someone -

10
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.756
- who's in a basement
hacking into complex security systems.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.280
And what he did was pretty simple.

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.395
He just found the weakest point.

13
00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:01.196
When I gave that click. I opened the
door. He just took everything he wanted.

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.439
18 million documents. e-mails.
contracts. spreadsheets.

15
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.316
Cristiano Ronaldo faces a conviction
for tax fraud.

16
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.075
It opens a window in society
that was not supposed to be opened.

17
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.400
We were facing a colossal fraud.

18
00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:30.159
What is Doyen? A company in London
which is owned by these Kazakh mafiosi.

19
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.995
It was the Wolf of Wall Street
invading football.

20
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.275
We were not dealing with
Mickey Mouse money but serious money.

21
00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.355
Constantly you're wondering who's the
puppet master behind these revelations.

22
00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.596
Of course it raises the alarms.
"Do we have a rat inside?"

23
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.000
He said to me.
"Clean football and clear my name."

24
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.760
Nobody knew who was doing it and what
would come next. It could be them.

25
00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.996
I don't like too much media exposure.
I preserve my privacy a lot.

26
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.476
So I don't know how your
script for this thing is -

27
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.756
- and I don't care in the end.

28
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.996
Unless you're going to portrait me as
the big bandito in the world of football.

29
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.960
But okay. let's go.

30
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.675
In 2015. Nélio Lucas was doing great.

31
00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.675
He was doing business with every
Portuguese club.

32
00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:07.675
Nélio Lucas is heading one of the major
investment funds in football.

33
00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.596
He's having a nice time at the beach.
so thanks once again for being here.

34
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.756
Nélio Lucas created a company
named Doyen Sports Investment.

35
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.075
They were presented in the beginning
as someone there to help clubs.

36
00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.316
The biggest assets of the clubs
are the players.

37
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.235
And you give them an alternative finance
for them to acquire those assets.

38
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.876
What does soccer need? A better
and more fair distribution of the money.

39
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.436
Fair competition. equal opportunities
and professionalism.

40
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.395
If a club couldn't afford a player.
instead of going to the bank -

41
00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.316
- they would go to Doyen.
who would then buy part of that player.

42
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.196
And then that same player would be sold
for 20-30 million euros -

43
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.515
- and their margin of profit
would be huge.

44
00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.599
So they had a nice business model.

45
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.919
From all the big clubs to the players to
the agencies. We worked with everybody.

46
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.235
We became probably
the most prominent and powerful -

47
00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.995
- powerhouse in the industry.

48
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.916
In only four years. they invested more
than 100 million euros in players -

49
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.916
- and managed the interest
of very famous people -

50
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.276
- like Xavi Hernández.
Neymar or David Beckham.

51
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.795
So it was a remarkable success
in such a short time.

52
00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.636
He was dining in London's most
expensive restaurants. driving a Bentley.

53
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.355
He owned a yacht worth more
than three million euros.

54
00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.276
Always on the phone. in a plane.

55
00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.076
I was a phone call away
from any president. manager. player.

56
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.956
If I call a president and they see
my number. they'll know it's important.

57
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.195
On my WhatsApp. I say that I'm always
available for a good deal.

58
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.836
I understood the industry -

59
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.000
- and I think it was successful.

60
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.956
I remember exactly where I was
when it first emerged.

61
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.079
I was walking back to my office.

62
00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.636
I got a text from a Brazilian lawyer.

63
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.839
And he said.
"Have you seen Football Leaks?"

64
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.399
I had no idea what he was talking
about. and he sent me this link.

65
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.519
It was to this website.
It was called Football Leaks.

66
00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.199
And it had some player contracts on it.

67
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.995
There was very confidential information
posted there.

68
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:55.396
My immediate reaction was "Oh God!".
because I was writing a book -

69
00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.636
- about the player trading market. and
it was so hard to get player contracts.

70
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.839
And someone's just put a website on
and is giving it away.

71
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.355
We thought of it like some kind
of WikiLeaks. a website -

72
00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:17.956
- where someone was posting confidential
documents they somehow had obtained.

73
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.235
We weren't used to reading
those kind of documents.

74
00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:26.636
They had details and little clauses.

75
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.639
And they seemed legitimate.

76
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.720
On their website. they had a statement...

77
00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:47.759
...saying they wanted to bring some light
into the darkness of the football world.

78
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.675
They were sick of how dirty
the football industry was -

79
00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.920
- and owed it to supporters
to show the true face of football.

80
00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:01.195
I tried to e-mail the guys
from the website -

81
00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:04.519
- but they never answered my e-mails.

82
00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:29.435
"John" appeared when he decided to speak
to the New York Times.

83
00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:33.075
He presented himself as "John" -

84
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:38.440
- and as a representative of a group
of people behind Football Leaks.

85
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.516
When you read about John's interview
with New York Times. how did that feel?

86
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.399
It sucked.

87
00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:05.080
Initially. people didn't get
the dimensions or the scale of this.

88
00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:15.919
And then it kind of exploded into life.

89
00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:40.475
It was very important to Real Madrid -

90
00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:45.595
- that they kept their biggest star happy.
and it wasn't Gareth Bale but Ronaldo -

91
00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:50.440
- who was bought years earlier
for a world-record fee.

92
00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.276
So. publicly they stated a fee -

93
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.996
- in the 90 millions for Gareth Bale.

94
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.835
It is a world-record deal. right?

95
00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:10.156
I don't want to get involved with that.
That's not for us to comment on.

96
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.715
- But it's not a bad deal.
- Towards 90 million is a lot of money.

97
00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:18.360
I'm not gonna comment on the amount.
but he's worth every penny.

98
00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:23.075
Football Leaks showed -

99
00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:28.440
- this contract that says
Gareth Bale cost 101 million euros.

100
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.639
It's quite funny.
You cannot upset Cristiano Ronaldo.

101
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.795
When these leaks were published -

102
00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:50.960
- I was absolutely shocked and disgusted.
I just think it's so wrong.

103
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.960
It's just nobody's business.
It's a private thing.

104
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.955
It kind of blows you away
even now to think about.

105
00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:15.955
You have some of the biggest
figures in football. whether it's Neymar -

106
00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.955
- or Gareth Bale -

107
00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:24.879
- and the biggest transaction is just
being pushed out on a random website.

108
00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:33.876
It created a lot of fear because
nobody knew who was doing it -

109
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.360
- and no one knew what would
come next. It could be them.

110
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.480
If you talk about sports in Portugal.
you talk about football.

111
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.315
People are glued to the screen -

112
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:15.315
- and many people choose football
over family and work.

113
00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:18.715
Football is a lifestyle in Portugal.

114
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:23.396
You have a huge passion
regarding three main clubs:

115
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.000
Benfica. Porto and Sporting.

116
00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:32.675
I was born into football.

117
00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:35.996
My very first memory is of FC Porto -

118
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.356
- and I made it my life.
both playing and being a fan.

119
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.715
I always loved the magic -

120
00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:46.876
- the cheering. the fumes. the flags.
the chants. All those things.

121
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.996
Daily. daily. daily...
I've done it my whole life -

122
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.919
- and I'm still here.

123
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.960
Benfica is the biggest club in Portugal
with the biggest amount of fans.

124
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.156
And then you have Porto.

125
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.159
They represent an anti-capital.
anti-power force from the north.

126
00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:26.840
Benfica is our biggest rival.

127
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.120
To me. Benfica represents corruption
and the state.

128
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.879
We're like Israel and Palestine.
like Ukraine and Russia.

129
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.279
I clearly remember
the day of the first contact.

130
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.276
I was having lunch nearby.

131
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.000
I got a weird e-mail.

132
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:31.679
So I reply. "How can I verify
the authenticity of this material?"

133
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.519
A few minutes later.
I receive another e-mail.

134
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.240
It was screenshots of Benfica's
e-mail inbox.

135
00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:53.679
So I reply. "Okay. looks real.
Do you have more?"

136
00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:05.679
That is how I got 20 gigabytes
of information.

137
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:19.636
It was an exchange of e-mails between
a highly respected referee -

138
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.036
- and someone from Benfica's management -

139
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:30.356
- in which they assumed that the referees
were being controlled by Benfica.

140
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.276
Most shocking was a list of phone numbers.
addresses -

141
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.996
- and things about
the private lives of referees.

142
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.835
Their lovers. girlfriends.
ex-girlfriends.

143
00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:49.996
This referee's girlfriend.
the daughter of that guy and so on.

144
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.996
It was absolutely shameful.

145
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.075
This is very serious.

146
00:15:56.159 --> 00:16:02.440
It can be used
to manipulate the referees.

147
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.715
This was absolutely shocking.

148
00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:12.279
We were facing colossal fraud.

149
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.195
I knew that the material we had
was explosive.

150
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:23.116
Should I go to the police?

151
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.320
Or make it public?

152
00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:35.955
...those were referees who were
at the service of Benfica.

153
00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:41.396
This is a referee corruption scheme
in favour of Benfica.

154
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.075
Over the course of six months.
we revealed e-mails -

155
00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:50.516
- showing Benfica's fraud.

156
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:56.200
Benfica wanted me arrested live on tv.
while I was reading the material on air.

157
00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:01.996
These are phone numbers I've blocked -

158
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.440
- because Benfica fans were calling
and sending me death threats.

159
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.359
Eventually. my family and I had to move
because of that.

160
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.995
I thought. "Who's sending me this?
A hacker?"

161
00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.836
A very good hacker. apparently.

162
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.156
I never learned who was sending me this.
I asked. but the person didn't reply.

163
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.960
This person was highly critical
of the football world.

164
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.596
This Doyen Group were clearly -

165
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.079
- the biggest investors in third-party
ownership and they came out of nowhere.

166
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:22.200
We wanted to know more about them.

167
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:34.316
I got 20 minutes with Nélio. who I was
really looking forward to talking to.

168
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.515
He was the front man for this business.

169
00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:40.396
This slick agent.

170
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.755
Sharp-suited. shiny shoes. good teeth.

171
00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:49.076
I asked him at the time.
"Who are your investors?"

172
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.596
"They're very rich. They're private."

173
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.675
"They're so rich
that this is just a plaything for them."

174
00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:00.759
It was very hard to get any information.

175
00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:15.000
Someone called me and pointed me
to this website. It came out of nowhere.

176
00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:21.240
It was strange.

177
00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:29.715
Once Football Leaks happened.
one of the stories -

178
00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:35.235
- had the schematic organisation chart
and the company structure.

179
00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:38.596
There was a holding company in Malta -

180
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.035
- and a split of assets
with this Nélio Lucas.

181
00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:48.275
For me it was like. "God.
we've been looking for this for years!"

182
00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:53.316
Of course it raised the alarms. "Where is
this coming from? Who's doing it?"

183
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.235
"Do we have a rat? Is this my shadow?
Is this my right hand?"

184
00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.960
"My lawyer? My IT guy? Who is it?"

185
00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:07.755
I went to my lawyers. and we pressed
charges against whatever was behind this.

186
00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:12.640
And we did it in Portugal
because the website was in Portuguese.

187
00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:18.356
The day they filed it to the authorities -

188
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.435
- was the day
I received the first e-mail -

189
00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:25.119
- from the person behind Football Leaks.

190
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.876
At a certain point in time.
the people behind Football Leaks stopped -

191
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.720
- publishing documents on the website.

192
00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:53.200
And they gave the exclusive
to Der Spiegel.

193
00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:05.356
We got a call from Der Spiegel
who told us:

194
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.515
"Look. We've contacted one of the guys
behind the Football Leaks website."

195
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:13.720
"He accepted to give us a lot of data."

196
00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:19.156
There were more
than 18 million documents.

197
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.319
Everything from e-mails. contracts.
pictures. video. spreadsheets.

198
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.076
Nobody knew how many documents
there were -

199
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.435
- and which documents
would be published next.

200
00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:42.720
So it created quite a sense of fear
in the football world.

201
00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:57.916
These stories showed
the structures built -

202
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.076
- in order for these guys to be paid.

203
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.796
They suggested that there was
an element of potential tax evasion -

204
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.720
- linked to some of the world's
biggest players.

205
00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:21.836
Coaches. players and agents
used fiscal planning -

206
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.519
- in an extreme way
with the clear goal of paying less taxes.

207
00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:32.316
There was Lionel Messi's tax affairs.

208
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.000
José Mourinho at the time.
Cristiano Ronaldo was involved.

209
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.759
It attracted the attention
of tax authorities across Europe.

210
00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:50.475
Cristiano Ronaldo
had to go to court in Madrid -

211
00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:54.995
- to plead guilty to the charges
against him of tax fraud.

212
00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:58.799
I was in Madrid to watch this trial.

213
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.755
It was a very intense day
with a lot of information.

214
00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:07.076
There was a lot of confusion
and excitement.

215
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.636
The world's best player was in court.
not knowing what could happen.

216
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.475
Cristiano Ronaldo faces
a conviction for tax fraud.

217
00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:21.235
He will pay 19 million euros -

218
00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:26.480
- to clear his criminal record
and avoid a prison sentence.

219
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.995
I can imagine the fear that gripped world
football as these leaks were coming out.

220
00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:39.079
Who's gonna be next?
Because this did have consequences.

221
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.876
I was in my house in London.

222
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.596
It was very early in the morning -

223
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.000
- and I received an e-mail
from this person. Artem Lobuzov.

224
00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:16.599
Would you mind reading out the e-mails?

225
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.435
The first e-mail...

226
00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:25.316
"The leak is much bigger
than you can imagine ..."

227
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.836
"The entire operation of Doyen is known.
The loans coming from the investors -

228
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.235
- the business model in Brazil.
Turkey and Central Asia." Bla. bla...

229
00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:41.316
"All this and much more can appear online.
Surely you shouldn't want that. right?"

230
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.755
"But we can talk."

231
00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:47.759
This was serious. of course it was.

232
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.755
You don't want a guy inside your house.
removing your things in your bedroom -

233
00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:58.960
- taking out your underwear. opening
your safe and trying to get access to it.

234
00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:06.076
He continued. "I have no interest
in harming you or your collaborators."

235
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.995
"I have nothing against you.
even respect for the way -

236
00:25:10.079 --> 00:25:13.995
- you rose to the top
of the football world."

237
00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:19.715
And then my reply. "I don't know
who you are. but what do you want?"

238
00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:23.235
I was trying to understand
who was behind this.

239
00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:28.076
And his immediate reply was very short
as well. "A generous donation -

240
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.316
- and you can be sure that all the
information will be deleted right away."

241
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.480
Then I asked. "What do you mean
by generous donation?"

242
00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:42.876
"Somewhere between
500 thousand and 1 million -

243
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.359
- will be a good donation
for this material."

244
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.675
Actually. I was surprised.
I thought it would be much more.

245
00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:59.796
You start to think.
"What information does he have?"

246
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.720
"What is he going to publish?"

247
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.995
I thought. "Okay.
we are dealing with a guy -

248
00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:12.440
- in Russia. China or North Korea."

249
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.636
But to make this even more bizarre.
he said to us:

250
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.995
"We can resolve this easily
and in the greatest possible secrecy -

251
00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:29.796
- between preferred lawyers."
I thought this was a joke.

252
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.796
How can lawyers be involved
in extortion -

253
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.680
- or in this kind of operation?

254
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.880
Artem Lobuzov presented his own lawyer.

255
00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:47.636
And a meeting was arranged -

256
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.356
- at a gas station on a highway -

257
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.359
- on the outskirts of Lisbon.

258
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.755
The term "super agent" is made up by the
press. I'm not quite sure what it means.

259
00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:22.955
If you ask me personally.
I'm a super person. so...

260
00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:26.876
The role of agents in football
is a controversial one.

261
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.200
They are the oil of the transfer industry
that has grown to seven billion dollars.

262
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.836
As far as I can tell. you are
the most successful agent in the world?

263
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.515
I haven't counted other people's money.
but numbers-wise -

264
00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:48.995
- and business-wise. I think
we are the most successful in the world.

265
00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:52.955
There are a handful of these people -

266
00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:55.920
- at the centre of world football.

267
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:02.916
They will start with Pini Zahavi.
Mino Raiola -

268
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.796
- Jorge Mendes and Jonathan Barnett.

269
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.440
They determine where some
of the best talent ends up.

270
00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:16.156
Gareth Bale is the one I'm best known
for being associated with -

271
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.156
- because we broke the world record.

272
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.839
It just propelled us to the very top.

273
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.796
For the agents who have spent decades
earning huge amounts of money -

274
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.515
- there was no great transparency about
how they earned it -

275
00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:39.035
- and exactly how much.
That suited them just fine.

276
00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:41.475
Football Leaks showed -

277
00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:45.396
- this huge commission they could make
and how they made it -

278
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.160
- the mechanisms inside the contracts.
And some of it was quite ugly.

279
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.116
One of the most significant stories
in Football Leaks -

280
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:05.076
- was the story of Paul Pogba's transfer
back to Manchester United -

281
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.440
- from Juventus...

282
00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:17.195
...and the amount of money
that went to Paul Pogba's agent.

283
00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:23.995
It showed that he was paid tens of
millions of euros for his role in this -

284
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:28.876
- just to be the man
who could get this thing done.

285
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.480
That just seems absolutely insane.

286
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.235
Mino made quite a lot of money.
Does that make him greedy?

287
00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:43.759
I don't think so.
It makes him quite clever.

288
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.515
Every fan in the world wants their team
to have the best players.

289
00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:53.596
They should be thankful to the agent
for getting them.

290
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.319
I think it's people being jealous.

291
00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:07.636
Would you go as far as to say that you
don't care about what fans think of you?

292
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.680
About me? I don't give a damn.

293
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:37.275
Nélio Lucas was communicating
with this Artem Lobuzov for several weeks.

294
00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:43.680
He actually sent a contact of a lawyer who
was ready to sit with us. Very bizarre.

295
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.435
The police said. "Find a public place
you're comfortable with."

296
00:30:55.519 --> 00:31:00.356
"And I'm sure someone will protect you
in case something goes wrong."

297
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.715
I set the place.
which was in a gas station in Oeiras.

298
00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:08.035
I wanted a place with other people.

299
00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:13.796
I didn't know if the lawyer was coming.
"Is he coming alone or with someone else?"

300
00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:19.515
Imagine you go to a place. there
is a truck. and they push you inside it.

301
00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:22.480
Of course it's scary.

302
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.356
The judiciary police was on the outside
of the gas station.

303
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.076
And they had two police officers
inside. at a table nearby -

304
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.160
- so they could listen in on the
conversation and act if necessary.

305
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:47.076
The emotions as you can imagine
were quite powerful -

306
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.955
- because you don't know what to expect.

307
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:55.796
Fortunately. it was just a meeting
between us and this lawyer.

308
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.195
It started like normal people.

309
00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.519
"Hello. good afternoon. how are you?
My name is this. my name is that."

310
00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:10.035
They tried to propose a way
to transform this thing -

311
00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:13.035
- into a document.

312
00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:18.755
They were trying to find a way
that it wasn't blackmail.

313
00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:23.435
Then I interrupted and said.
"Look. actually I would like to speak."

314
00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:27.156
"First thing I don't understand is how you
are going to transform extortion -

315
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.396
- into a contract?
It sounds very bizarre."

316
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.995
Nélio Lucas' goal was to make
Aníbal Pinto speak -

317
00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:40.156
- so they could get more leads -

318
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.316
- in order to discover
who was really behind the attack.

319
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.995
During my conversation with him.
I was trying to portray the fact -

320
00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:53.195
- that if this guy is really talented -

321
00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:57.356
- instead of paying him for the silence
I would like him to work for me.

322
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.675
I created a way to try
to push more from him -

323
00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:03.839
- and it actually worked.

324
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.356
Aníbal Pinto gave me some idea
of his qualifications.

325
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.435
First of all he said: "This guy is
very talented with computers."

326
00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:22.156
"And he never gets caught. I helped him
in a case with a bank in the Caymans."

327
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.480
"He took money. and in the end
I managed to save him."

328
00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:34.715
That was interesting
for the police investigators.

329
00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:38.755
They started to see
a lot of coincidences -

330
00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:43.195
- with a case that happened
two years before.

331
00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:48.400
They were wondering. "I wonder
if it's the same person behind this."

332
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.960
John in 2018 got in touch with me -

333
00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.236
- by encrypted mail.

334
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.320
He was looking for a lawyer. because
he was quite scared to be arrested.

335
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.635
I've been a lawyer for 40 years. dedicated
to defend main whistleblowers.

336
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.876
I'm still the lawyer of Edward Snowden -

337
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.595
- and Antoine Deltour.
who is at the origin of LuxLeaks.

338
00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:55.480
And Hervé Falciani. Swiss Leaks.

339
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.719
So. of course I was interested
in Football Leaks.

340
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.760
I flew to Budapest in August 2018...

341
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.480
...just to explore how I could help him.

342
00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:21.756
We had a drink and dinner -

343
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.676
- and we talked extensively
about his case.

344
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.955
It was important to obtain
his confidence.

345
00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:32.796
And he said to me. as a roadmap -

346
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.955
- as a clear frontier:

347
00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:40.796
"I want to clean football
and clear my name."

348
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.880
"Clean football and clear my name."

349
00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:57.035
Football Leaks presented Doyen
as an evil organisation.

350
00:35:57.119 --> 00:36:01.320
They started exhibiting contracts
between us and the clubs.

351
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.119
And they would really portray us
very bad. Very unfairly bad.

352
00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:24.196
The only goal of Doyen Sports
was to make money.

353
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.000
It was the Wolf of Wall Street
invading football.

354
00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:44.836
They were very strict
and very detailed contracts.

355
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.995
If there was an offer above a certain
amount for a player -

356
00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:52.515
- the clubs were forced to sell.

357
00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:55.356
If the player is sold for this amount -

358
00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.000
- Doyen will get 10-50% of the money
that they have invested.

359
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.400
We haven't seen any contract
like this before.

360
00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:13.356
Towards the end of 2018. there were
revelations that really shook the game.

361
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.916
Thousands and thousands of documents...

362
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.995
It was the whole panorama of football -

363
00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:23.995
- exposed in different ways.

364
00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:27.360
How is this all likely to rock
the global game?

365
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.676
Manchester City. this team that is owned
by the brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi -

366
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.480
- had allegedly inflated its revenues -

367
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:49.075
- in a way that. what the revelation
showed. was an illegal way.

368
00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:53.276
<i>Massive breaking news. UEFA
has decided that Manchester City -</i>

369
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.360
<i>- are to be hit hard
for breaking financial rules.</i>

370
00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:11.876
Also around that time. this story
that is still having disastrous effects -

371
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.995
- for the FIFA president
Gianni Infantino appeared.

372
00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:19.716
This is about these meetings
between the FIFA president -

373
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.880
- and the then prosecutor general
of Switzerland.

374
00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:31.599
And that investigation into Infantino
and those meetings remains ongoing.

375
00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:39.515
Another very significant one was a story
about some of Europe's biggest clubs -

376
00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:44.115
- hatching a plot to create
a breakaway super league.

377
00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:46.876
It would affect
every single fan in Europe -

378
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.155
- and fundamentally rock
the football business.

379
00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:53.515
This super league project
did materialise -

380
00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:57.716
- albeit in such a poor fashion
that it collapsed in 48 hours.

381
00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:04.239
But it's the closest football has come
to a seismic breakaway of its kind.

382
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.756
There was a general revulsion
from a lot of the public.

383
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.000
You had a sense that there was
a decay in football.

384
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:22.635
But these leaks confirmed it.

385
00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:26.756
That the game had lost its bearings -

386
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.995
- had become unmoored from
what football was -

387
00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:33.876
- which was these football teams
in their local community -

388
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.239
- giving a few hours of distraction
to people.

389
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:49.635
Instead it's this often vulgar business -

390
00:39:49.719 --> 00:39:53.115
- where power and money are colliding -

391
00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:58.960
- and a few actors are able to take
what they can from the people's game.

392
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.995
Constantly you're wondering.
"Who is the puppet master -

393
00:40:09.079 --> 00:40:12.280
- behind these revelations?"

394
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.035
At that point in time.
the football atmosphere -

395
00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:36.276
- in Portugal was completely toxic.

396
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.440
This is a referee corruption scheme
in favour of Benfica.

397
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.760
We were trying to find out more about
who was behind the Benfica leaks case.

398
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:52.840
And we were calling people.
calling sources.

399
00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:56.276
We started to hear some rumours -

400
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.400
- but no one was telling his name.

401
00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:09.440
But in early September 2018. a case
that involved Benfica got to its end.

402
00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:13.876
And when it ended. a source told us:

403
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.475
"Go there and have a look
into the appendices of the process."

404
00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.876
"Okay. Why?"

405
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:25.716
"Because the guy you're looking for.
his name is there."

406
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.639
And we went.
"Wow! Okay. Let's have a look."

407
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.115
In the morning. I went to the court.

408
00:41:49.199 --> 00:41:53.955
I had asked for permission to see -

409
00:41:54.039 --> 00:41:57.800
- the files about the investigation.

410
00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:10.475
There was a folder
which had the case about Benfica.

411
00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:14.035
I was looking. looking. looking -

412
00:42:14.119 --> 00:42:17.480
- until I got to a page.

413
00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:23.796
There was a written note
by the public attorney.

414
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.995
It described part of the investigation -

415
00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:33.199
- and part of the meeting
at the gas station on the highway.

416
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.635
"This investigation originated
in a complaint by Doyen Sports -

417
00:42:40.719 --> 00:42:46.115
- against unknown. The complaint is from
Nélio Lucas against Artem Lobuzov."

418
00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:50.475
"There's an identified suspect."

419
00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:53.356
And there it was.

420
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.719
Rui Pinto.

421
00:42:58.519 --> 00:43:03.276
That's how I found the name of Rui Pinto.

422
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.119
It was in the public documents.

423
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:19.635
- Do you have the magazine with you?
- Yes.

424
00:43:19.719 --> 00:43:23.800
- Can we see it?
- Sure. You haven't seen it before?

425
00:43:25.159 --> 00:43:30.035
The headline says. "The hacker
who stole the Benfica secrets."

426
00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:34.196
Then it has a small text saying
he's an IT genius -

427
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.435
- and that he created Football Leaks
with information from Doyen -

428
00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:42.276
- Real Madrid. Porto and Sporting -

429
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.115
- and he's being investigated
in Portugal and in Spain.

430
00:43:47.199 --> 00:43:52.035
We found out that he was a young guy
from Porto -

431
00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:54.435
- and that he was living abroad.

432
00:43:54.519 --> 00:44:00.356
And that he was like a self-made man
in terms of IT knowledge.

433
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.196
On Sábado magazine's front page -

434
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.316
- the man suspected of stealing secrets
from Benfica is a Portuguese hacker...

435
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.756
When we published that story. it was
all over the news for weeks and weeks.

436
00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.276
Rui Pinto created Football Leaks.

437
00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.760
In 2015. he started getting into football.
the mess with companies and clubs.

438
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.995
For months. Rui Pinto's father
and sister were the targets of wiretaps.

439
00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:32.196
But one day. they intercepted a message
on the telephone of Rui Pinto's father -

440
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.880
- about the purchase of flight tickets
to Budapest. Hungary.

441
00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:51.475
Rui Pinto's father and stepmother
were followed from the airport -

442
00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:55.599
- to his apartment in Budapest.

443
00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:07.276
Then Rui Pinto was surprised at home
early in the morning -

444
00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.196
- by the Hungarian police.
who served a European arrest warrant -

445
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.920
- with Rui Pinto's name on it.
issued by the Portuguese authorities.

446
00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:28.836
The arrest of the mastermind
of Football Leaks -

447
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:35.280
- was a global headline
because of the years of crazy stories.

448
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.995
Hi. This is Rui Pinto. I am John -

449
00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:02.159
- the whistleblower from Football Leaks.

450
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.920
John. Rui Pinto. Artem.
it is all the same person.

451
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.316
There he was with this hair.
This is the guy behind Football Leaks.

452
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.716
Your face drops.

453
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:35.356
It was quite funny in a way
that this small kid -

454
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.955
- had unleashed what he had.

455
00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:44.035
This spiky-haired university student -

456
00:46:44.119 --> 00:46:48.800
- with a backpack
and a cherubic. childlike face.

457
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.435
It just did not fit the mould -

458
00:46:54.519 --> 00:47:00.159
- of a man who has brought so
much chaos into the world of football.

459
00:47:01.559 --> 00:47:05.595
That's the fascinating part of it.
Because when you think of a hacker -

460
00:47:05.679 --> 00:47:10.316
- you think of someone who's in
a basement doing very complicated stuff -

461
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.995
- hacking into complex security systems.

462
00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:19.199
And what he did was pretty simple.
He just did some phishing.

463
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.075
He just sent e-mails to people. And people
don't know how to use computers.

464
00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:34.159
I received an e-mail. apparently from the
sports director of FC Porto at that time -

465
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:40.396
- who wanted to share a file
with information on players.

466
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.435
Someone sends an e-mail
with an attachment or a link -

467
00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:48.276
- that seems credible.
and people will click.

468
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.356
I considered it legit.
I pressed to open the file.

469
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.115
In a very logical and very simple way -

470
00:47:57.199 --> 00:48:00.840
- he just found the weakest point
in an IT system.

471
00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:06.756
Basically. when I gave that click.
I opened the door.

472
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.595
He just went there
and took everything he wanted.

473
00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:14.480
Until he was caught.

474
00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:31.356
The Portuguese authorities
issued a European arrest warrant -

475
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.280
- for him to be extradited to Portugal.

476
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.840
We knew that he would be put
on a plane soon.

477
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.960
In March 2019.
he was extradited to Portugal.

478
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.320
He was questioned by a judge
and sent to pre-trial detention.

479
00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:10.916
And then it was a new chapter -

480
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.079
- of this saga. this soap opera.

481
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:17.000
He was sent to jail.

482
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.075
William Bourdon. whom I had worked with
on other cases -

483
00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:52.955
- came to see me in my office
in the EU Parliament and told me:

484
00:49:53.039 --> 00:49:59.356
"I've been called to defend a young guy
who's been arrested in Hungary."

485
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.876
"He's supposed to be the source
of Football Leaks."

486
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.599
"He's going to jail
and he will be tried in Portugal."

487
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.115
I said. "Portugal did nothing about -

488
00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:18.115
- the money laundering
and tax evasion activities -

489
00:50:18.199 --> 00:50:22.196
- that we could see
thanks to Football Leaks."

490
00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.916
"And now they're going to focus
on the guy who has exposed -

491
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.639
- the illicit activity?"

492
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.995
And William asked.
"I will need a good lawyer in Portugal -

493
00:50:35.079 --> 00:50:37.356
- to help me with his case."

494
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.679
So I put William in touch with
Francisco Teixeira da Mota.

495
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.995
William Bourdon and I came
to the conclusion -

496
00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:52.035
- that it would be good to work together.

497
00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:58.356
When he was in jail. we went there
once or twice a week.

498
00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.515
He was not happy with
what we saw in football.

499
00:51:02.599 --> 00:51:07.075
These third-party ownerships that were.
for him. destroying football.

500
00:51:07.159 --> 00:51:11.475
He thought it was wrong
and hidden from society.

501
00:51:11.559 --> 00:51:15.356
And he decided to make it public.

502
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.316
In Portugal there was a lot of excitement.
Everybody called him "the hacker".

503
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.836
He was being portrayed
in a very negative way.

504
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.716
And I was asking all the time.
"How come the Portuguese authorities -

505
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.039
- take a complaint from Doyen
and then go after Rui Pinto?"

506
00:51:36.519 --> 00:51:39.995
The second award goes to a person -

507
00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:43.519
- who is now in custody in Portugal.

508
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:50.276
About that time. one of the political
groups of the European Parliament -

509
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.800
- was giving an award to whistleblowers.

510
00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:59.079
He's the architect of the
Football Leaks whistleblowing case.

511
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:07.760
I went there because among the awardees
was Rui Pinto.

512
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.316
Some powerful people
would prefer to keep the truth -

513
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.635
- about corruption in the football world
in the shadows. and this is unacceptable.

514
00:52:16.719 --> 00:52:20.356
All supporters who are more committed
to the value of sports than to money -

515
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.480
- should support Rui Pinto.

516
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.916
Since Rui Pinto wasn't able to be there -

517
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.515
- they asked me if I would be able
to deliver this to him.

518
00:52:32.599 --> 00:52:38.000
So I decided to ask permission
from the authorities to see him in jail.

519
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.756
I think he was pleased and felt
this was indeed a recognition -

520
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.635
- that part of the society really
appreciated what he had done.

521
00:52:57.719 --> 00:53:03.196
The first time we met. I was surprised.
He looked much younger than he was -

522
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.716
- with a funny hair shape.

523
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.955
He was very serious and very persuaded -

524
00:53:13.039 --> 00:53:15.880
- of the importance of what he had done.

525
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.519
I had to participate in something bigger.
I had to...

526
00:53:23.039 --> 00:53:26.595
...try to make a difference.

527
00:53:26.679 --> 00:53:30.756
Fortunately. I had the chance -

528
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.356
- to gather a quantity of documents -

529
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.955
- related to football.

530
00:53:38.039 --> 00:53:40.960
Well. the next steps were to...

531
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.916
...try to expose what was wrong.

532
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.515
I was... impressed with the kid.

533
00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:54.679
I was genuinely impressed.

534
00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.719
Public opinion little by little changed.

535
00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:06.995
Remember what happened in some stadiums.

536
00:54:07.079 --> 00:54:09.719
"Thank you. Rui Pinto!"

537
00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:16.159
"Free Pinto!"

538
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.515
People shouting. "Free Pinto!"

539
00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:24.356
Because a community of players -

540
00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.916
- understood that what Pinto did -

541
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.199
- makes him a friend of football.

542
00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.995
Rui Pinto was in preventive detention -

543
00:54:41.079 --> 00:54:46.599
- and there were many demonstrations
demanding the young man's release.

544
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:11.756
I saw on Facebook that there was
a demonstration in support of Rui Pinto.

545
00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:18.435
I contacted the organization and asked
if I could bring 200-300 Porto fans.

546
00:55:18.519 --> 00:55:23.000
We also decided to join. not only
as citizens but as supporters.

547
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.760
Because a person who did good
was being penalised.

548
00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:36.435
I think Rui Pinto should be decorated
as a national hero -

549
00:55:36.519 --> 00:55:39.316
- for making this discovery -

550
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.679
- and for having exposed it.

551
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.635
He was more than a year in prison.

552
00:55:54.719 --> 00:55:57.876
He was angry and outraged -

553
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.435
- that the authorities had followed
the complaints of the crooks -

554
00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:06.475
- and going after the whistleblower
instead of the crooks.

555
00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:11.595
What matters for me and for Football Leaks
is that the documents are authentic.

556
00:56:11.679 --> 00:56:17.435
I don't care about the origin.
I'm a whistleblower so I have to expose.

557
00:56:17.519 --> 00:56:21.000
That's the only thing that matters to me.

558
00:56:30.239 --> 00:56:34.955
Once I learned that Doyen was -

559
00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:41.960
- the main accuser of Rui Pinto.
I did my own investigation into Doyen.

560
00:56:46.679 --> 00:56:49.716
What do I find out? That it is -

561
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.276
- this company who doesn't even
have headquarters in Portugal.

562
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.236
That it's based in Malta.
Already quite suspicious.

563
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.159
That this Portuguese guy.
Nélio Lucas. is a front man.

564
00:57:03.719 --> 00:57:07.836
Malta is in the European Union
and it's not forbidden nor a crime -

565
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:14.916
- to use a tax-efficiency jurisdiction
to optimise the results of your business.

566
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.356
If I can pay five instead of ten.
why should I pay ten?

567
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.679
For some reason. these things exist.
I didn't create them.

568
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.075
What did they have against us? Nothing.

569
00:57:29.159 --> 00:57:32.635
They could claim. "These guys
are making a lot of money." Okay.

570
00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:36.995
We were not dealing with
Mickey Mouse money but serious money.

571
00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:42.119
So they tried to understand. "Who's
behind? Where is this money coming from?"

572
00:57:46.119 --> 00:57:50.995
I was a witness in this court case
against Rui Pinto.

573
00:57:51.079 --> 00:57:54.916
The day I was going to court to testify -

574
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.836
- the judge asked. "Explain to me.
how did your partners make money?"

575
00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:05.480
What a stupid question. I said.
"Look. I don't know how they make money."

576
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.995
Who's behind Nélio Lucas
is a very interesting question.

577
00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:16.836
In the Football Leaks document
they write:

578
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.916
"Nélio Lucas must be
the only face of Doyen."

579
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.155
"Nobody must know who's behind it."
And who's behind -

580
00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:31.396
- is a family of Kazakh-Turkish
oligarchs called the Arifs.

581
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.075
When the Berlin Wall
and the USSR collapsed -

582
00:58:35.159 --> 00:58:38.356
- they made their fortunes
in mineral resources.

583
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.396
They built a huge and secret empire.

584
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:47.079
A maze of offshore companies in all
the worst tax havens on the planet.

585
00:58:52.719 --> 00:58:55.276
There are four brothers -

586
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.595
- and Tevfik Arif is
the only public figure.

587
00:58:59.679 --> 00:59:04.796
He was based first in Turkey.
Then he moved to the US -

588
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:11.119
- where he began to invest in real estate
in association with Donald Trump.

589
00:59:15.079 --> 00:59:19.515
The US Congress has recently established
that they are an organisation -

590
00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:24.075
- laundering money for the Russian mafia.

591
00:59:24.159 --> 00:59:27.239
They thought that football
would be a good investment.

592
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.276
And at some point they decided
to create an office in London -

593
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.119
- that they called Doyen Sports.

594
00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.396
In the beginning of the 2010s.
Tevfik Arif asks his son -

595
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.796
- Arif Efendi to go to London -

596
00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:50.396
- to run Doyen Sports with Nélio Lucas.

597
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.955
Because of the past of the family.
their connections -

598
00:59:54.039 --> 00:59:58.356
- in the heads of people.
this leads immediately -

599
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.995
- to something unknown
or strange or bizarre.

600
01:00:03.079 --> 01:00:06.876
Immediately you see these people
with long beards. Kalashnikovs.

601
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.995
And no. these are people with suits.
big investments. international deals.

602
01:00:11.079 --> 01:00:16.039
From there. you just invest your money
the best way possible.

603
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.435
The first thing that got the police
on the tail of Rui Pinto -

604
01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:28.760
- was the meeting at the highway
between Nélio Lucas and Aníbal Pinto.

605
01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.876
Aníbal Pinto mentioned.
that he had represented his client -

606
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:40.119
- in a previous investigation
where he had hacked into a bank.

607
01:00:44.199 --> 01:00:49.396
A couple of years before Football Leaks.
someone was able to access the server -

608
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.960
- of the Caledonian Bank. an offshore
bank located on the Cayman Islands.

609
01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.955
On September 18th. 2013. Rui Pinto
entered the Caledonian Bank servers -

610
01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:07.276
- went to an account of a client
and transferred 46.000 dollars -

611
01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.676
- to his own bank account
in Deutsche Bank in Lisbon.

612
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.639
That transfer went unnoticed.

613
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.955
But then in October. he went back
to the Caledonian Bank -

614
01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:23.039
- and transferred 310.000 dollars.

615
01:01:24.719 --> 01:01:27.995
That specific account was part
of a pensions fund -

616
01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:34.196
- so they immediately noticed
that there was 300.000 dollars missing.

617
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:40.635
Initially Rui Pinto said. "No. I have
nothing to do with it. That's my money."

618
01:01:40.719 --> 01:01:46.995
Then he recognised that the 310.000
dollars weren't his and gave it back -

619
01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:51.679
- but he said
that the 46.000 dollars were his.

620
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.435
His lawyer. Aníbal Pinto. went to the
lawyers that represent Caledonian Bank -

621
01:01:58.519 --> 01:02:02.756
- and said. "Okay. let's go to court.
I will call all your clients to testify -

622
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.716
- and the entire world will know
that the bank was hacked."

623
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.000
Immediately the lawyers from the bank
said. "No. let's find an agreement."

624
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.396
Rui Pinto would give back half
the money from those 46.000 dollars -

625
01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.480
- and that's it. In judicial terms.
it's a closed case in Portugal.

626
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.800
Rui Pinto's record is clean.

627
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.035
But the Caledonian Bank tells us something
about Rui Pinto's past.

628
01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:42.236
It doesn't fit with the story
he's telling about himself -

629
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.000
- as a whistleblower.
a Robin Hood of the football industry.

630
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.995
<i>Correspondence violation.
hacking. IT fraud -</i>

631
01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:57.435
<i>- illegitimate access. illegal tapping.</i>

632
01:02:57.519 --> 01:03:02.276
The Caledonian Bank tells a story
of someone who went to a bank -

633
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.676
- in an offshore territory
looking for money.

634
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.995
Someone who was trying to enrich himself.

635
01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:14.836
It's this dark side of his own story -

636
01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.039
- that doesn't fit with the rest.

637
01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:23.316
It's a contradiction. You see a guy -

638
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.716
- that actually should have some ability.

639
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.276
He did something
that you need to have knowledge to do.

640
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.236
Simultaneously. he's probably not
the brightest mind in the world.

641
01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.075
A guy that takes money from a bank
and sends it to his bank account...

642
01:03:40.159 --> 01:03:46.280
It's a little bit. "Come on. At a minimum
at least try to pass it somewhere."

643
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.796
We discovered that Doyen Sports
had absolutely no interest -

644
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.515
- in the careers of the football players
they invested in.

645
01:04:02.599 --> 01:04:05.716
For them. football players
were like objects.

646
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:12.796
For instance. when Brazil qualified
for the World Cup semi-finals in 2014 -

647
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.199
- they wrote: "Neymar bitch.
Nigga making us money."

648
01:04:18.679 --> 01:04:25.196
Another example is Radamel Falcao.
In 2013. he moved to Monaco.

649
01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.236
They made a very good profit
with Falcao's sale. but they wanted more.

650
01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.756
They published WhatsApp texts between
you and Arif. I'll just read them out.

651
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.995
They have you saying about Falcao:

652
01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:42.796
"He went to Monaco. that fuck.
His career is finished."

653
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.396
This is a message between him and me.

654
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.276
If I go to your mobile phone
and start reading messages -

655
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.035
- I'm sure I'm going to find something
you don't want exposed.

656
01:04:54.119 --> 01:04:59.356
It's like if I see a girl in a restaurant
and say. "Nice boobs. Nice ass."

657
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.920
Then you read that out of context and say.
"What kind of word has he selected?"

658
01:05:05.719 --> 01:05:11.396
We can see from the documents that
Doyen has a regular use of prostitutes.

659
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:18.400
Nélio Lucas and Arif Efendi
often discuss prostitutes on WhatsApp.

660
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.515
In order to be discreet. Arif Efendi
calls the prostitutes "footballers".

661
01:05:24.599 --> 01:05:28.155
"Organise footballers now.
Don't fucking waste time."

662
01:05:28.239 --> 01:05:32.000
"We're gonna end up
like last night with nothing."

663
01:05:43.159 --> 01:05:48.115
Definitely. me not involved in this.
For sure not. 100%.

664
01:05:48.199 --> 01:05:51.920
Run your biggest. deepest investigation.

665
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.280
Got it. Can you tell me about your trip
to Miami in August 2013?

666
01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:09.236
In August 2013. there is
a promotional tournament in Miami -

667
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.440
- with some big European teams.

668
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.635
It was a trip like any other. I went there
to see the pre-season games.

669
01:06:18.719 --> 01:06:24.035
His main goal is not to watch football
but to try to sell one of the players -

670
01:06:24.119 --> 01:06:28.796
- in which he has a stake.
a French player. Geoffrey Kondogbia.

671
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:34.515
There is a release clause
of 20 million euros in his contract.

672
01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:40.356
So Nélio Lucas is doing everything he can
so that Kondogbia is sold.

673
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.159
And we know that because they are
discussing the matter on WhatsApp.

674
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.000
At some point Nélio Lucas
writes to Arif Efendi:

675
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.995
He says that even Florentino Pérez.
the president of Real Madrid -

676
01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:26.475
- removed his tie and danced.
partied on the dance floor.

677
01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:29.635
We went to a club.
We had nice drinks and a lot of fun.

678
01:07:29.719 --> 01:07:34.079
Something normal between friends.
I'm happy he enjoyed it.

679
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The most interesting is
what happens the day after.

680
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:51.115
The Arif family have a huge penthouse
on Fisher Island -

681
01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:56.836
- which is basically a billionaire's
island. just off Miami Beach.

682
01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.000
Nélio Lucas texts Arif Efendi
and tells him:

683
01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:13.635
The messages are quite explicit
about the fact that this is a sex party -

684
01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:17.355
- and that the girls he wants
to bring are prostitutes -

685
01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:20.000
- and they want to invite
Florentino Pérez.

686
01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:45.395
Arif Efendi's father. Tevfik Arif...
Arif Efendi calls him Skip.

687
01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:49.315
And Nélio answers. "I will give
Skip's room to Florentino then."

688
01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:53.840
Arif answers:
"For 20 million euros. for Kondogbia."

689
01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.796
I don't recognise these texts.
It is definitely not from me.

690
01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.039
If I want to do something like this.
I don't need to ask permission.

691
01:09:08.199 --> 01:09:10.676
This is like. "The movie is nice -

692
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.195
- but if you add a nude sex scene.
it's much more interesting."

693
01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.920
At least think and come up
with a better story.

694
01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:23.155
Florentino Pérez strongly denied -

695
01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:26.319
- having taken part in this party.

696
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.476
In another text a few days later.
Nélio Lucas says to Arif Efendi -

697
01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:40.235
- that Florentino Pérez was interested
in the player but would pay only 15.

698
01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:47.000
So. finally AS Monaco accepted to pay
the 20 million and to buy Kondogbia.

699
01:10:00.199 --> 01:10:05.075
September 2020.
It's the first day of Rui Pinto's trial -

700
01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:09.955
- in Lisbon's main court.
and the apparatus is enormous.

701
01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:14.636
It was a full house. You had dozens
of reporters from around the world -

702
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.275
- waiting outside for the trial to start.

703
01:10:18.359 --> 01:10:20.836
There were police all over the place.

704
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.955
And there were rubberneckers and the
public trying to understand the circus.

705
01:10:26.039 --> 01:10:29.796
When will Rui Pinto make a statement?

706
01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't commit crimes. I'm an honourable
lawyer. and I'm here to clarify.

707
01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:39.596
This was a major event for the country.

708
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.756
Rui Pinto is accused of 90 crimes -

709
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.876
- among them attempted extortion.

710
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.756
He faced years and years of detention.

711
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.355
Rui Pinto represents
a world free from corruption -

712
01:10:55.439 --> 01:11:00.995
- and doesn't act out of personal greed
or personal interest.

713
01:11:01.079 --> 01:11:03.920
He stands up for a better society.

714
01:11:09.279 --> 01:11:12.395
He doesn't enter through the main door.
he goes through the garage.

715
01:11:12.479 --> 01:11:16.520
Wears a bulletproof vest in the courtroom.

716
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:25.836
Extreme security measures
never seen before in Portugal.

717
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.275
At the same point in time.
there was a trial for terrorism -

718
01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:34.436
- in which some people were accused of
being a part of the Islamic State.

719
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.596
And security measures weren't that high.

720
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.756
People have lost a lot of money. People
have had their reputations shredded.

721
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.235
They are furious that their innermost
business secrets were leaked.

722
01:11:47.319 --> 01:11:51.395
If you've upset that many people. there is
a chance that one or two of them -

723
01:11:51.479 --> 01:11:53.600
- might want to do you harm.

724
01:11:58.479 --> 01:12:00.275
Knowledge is power.

725
01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:06.836
So people that have power try
to prevent others from having knowledge.

726
01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:13.720
I think Rui opens a window in society
that was not supposed to be open.

727
01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.436
He's been accused of 90 crimes
of improper access -

728
01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.836
- correspondence violation.
illegitimate access.

729
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.115
The hacker guaranteed before the court
that he didn't consider himself a hacker -

730
01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:32.395
- but a whistleblower who revealed
a lot of information -

731
01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:36.195
- that made it possible
to open several inquiries -

732
01:12:36.279 --> 01:12:41.395
- not only in Portugal
but also in other European countries.

733
01:12:41.479 --> 01:12:45.195
Thank you for hearing me today.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden.

734
01:12:45.279 --> 01:12:49.275
The final accounting
of any act of whistleblowing -

735
01:12:49.359 --> 01:12:52.079
- is found in its consequences.

736
01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:57.995
Rui Pinto is the Edward Snowden
of the fight against corruption.

737
01:12:58.079 --> 01:13:01.436
In the case of Rui Pinto.
there is no question -

738
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.275
- that the stories uncovered -

739
01:13:04.359 --> 01:13:08.436
- have advanced the public interest.
And I hope you will agree.

740
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.275
Such an exceptional whistleblower
as Pinto has to be protected.

741
01:13:13.359 --> 01:13:17.075
Has to be recognised
by the judge as someone -

742
01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:21.836
- who sacrificed himself
for public interest.

743
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.035
I think it's offensive to Edward Snowden
when you compare Rui Pinto to him.

744
01:13:26.119 --> 01:13:29.676
You can't compare them. You just can't.

745
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.995
The whistleblower defence.
for me. is slightly worrying.

746
01:13:33.079 --> 01:13:36.716
The idea that someone
can essentially walk into your house -

747
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.756
- see if you're not a good person
and then leave.

748
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.000
It doesn't work that way.
The ends don't justify the means.

749
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.596
Did you ever ask him where he got his
information from or did you not care?

750
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.955
I did ask him.

751
01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:08.916
He was never clear to me. so I thought
that I should not insist too much.

752
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.355
Can you explain how Rui Pinto
got hold of the material?

753
01:14:12.439 --> 01:14:16.355
I don't worry about it.
As a lawyer I don't need to know that.

754
01:14:16.439 --> 01:14:22.596
The details of his adventure
are not a matter of interest for me.

755
01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.399
I don't give a damn.

756
01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:27.720
What does it change?

757
01:14:29.039 --> 01:14:34.636
The first day he spoke in court. Rui Pinto
assured that he was a whistleblower -

758
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.395
- and that he had never asked for money
in exchange for not revealing information.

759
01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:43.275
In the background.
Doyen is the main complainant -

760
01:14:43.359 --> 01:14:46.995
- that takes the pirate to court.

761
01:14:47.079 --> 01:14:51.476
The important thing that's on trial
is the extortion attempt.

762
01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.955
It doesn't fit with the story
Rui Pinto is telling about himself.

763
01:14:56.039 --> 01:14:59.516
They tried to portray it
like David against Goliath.

764
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.636
These guys from Doyen are banditos.
full of cash -

765
01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:08.800
- and this guy is in the middle of nowhere
trying to expose them.

766
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.960
You can't not talk about
the extortion case.

767
01:15:14.119 --> 01:15:19.315
He has spoken about wanting to rid
football of all the murkiness.

768
01:15:19.399 --> 01:15:23.075
If this guy appeared at a point
to try and profit -

769
01:15:23.159 --> 01:15:27.275
- from his ability to access files
he shouldn't -

770
01:15:27.359 --> 01:15:30.476
- this is a little stain
across all of that.

771
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.239
It will be an original sin
for the Football Leaks project.

772
01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:41.955
He never the intention
to receive any money.

773
01:15:42.039 --> 01:15:45.239
It was just a game. It was just a game.

774
01:15:46.319 --> 01:15:50.920
I decided to play with them.
I contacted Nélio Lucas.

775
01:15:55.279 --> 01:16:01.516
I basically said. "Yeah.
I have some documents about Doyen."

776
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.796
I wanted to see their reaction.
I wanted to know -

777
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:11.355
- how valuable
these documents were for them.

778
01:16:11.439 --> 01:16:15.239
I wanted to know
how far they were ready to go.

779
01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:30.319
He feigned to have the willingness
to receive money -

780
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.676
- to demonstrate their fear.

781
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.315
Because if you accept to pay some money -

782
01:16:40.399 --> 01:16:45.800
- it's because you're obsessed to maintain
a law of silence.

783
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.159
If there is something that does not
interest Pinto it's money.

784
01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.800
He doesn't give a damn.

785
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.636
It doesn't make any sense
that they're just trying to see -

786
01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.880
- how much money
Doyen was available to pay.

787
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.920
There are some e-mails in which
Rui Pinto talks with Aníbal Pinto...

788
01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:28.239
...about setting up
an account in Malta...

789
01:17:31.359 --> 01:17:34.960
...because he would have fiscal benefits.

790
01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:50.840
It's highly ironic he's fighting fiscal
evasion and people paying less taxes...

791
01:17:54.239 --> 01:18:00.960
...but he himself saw that he would
pay less tax in Malta than in Hungary.

792
01:18:23.479 --> 01:18:26.955
I think Rui Pinto did an excellent job.

793
01:18:27.039 --> 01:18:30.476
He helped the Portuguese and the world -

794
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.439
- to understand everything
that is happening in football.

795
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.476
He achieved all of that.

796
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.399
The whole machine that was assembled
was dismantled.

797
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.195
I will invite him to come
and see a game -

798
01:18:52.279 --> 01:18:58.079
- so that everyone can applaud him
and thank him for everything he has done.

799
01:19:03.399 --> 01:19:09.916
You may say that thanks to Rui Pinto
some illegal behaviour -

800
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.520
- of some actors in the football industry
is no longer possible.

801
01:19:19.119 --> 01:19:22.676
I recall everything
that was written about me.

802
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.476
These guys are calling you a criminal -

803
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.876
- like you're acting for these
bad organisations in the world.

804
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.035
You don't sleep. You get nervous.

805
01:19:34.119 --> 01:19:37.359
You lose business opportunities.

806
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.955
The guy who ran Doyen...
I don't wanna mention the name. but...

807
01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:49.720
What he was doing and how he lived his
life in the football world was terrible.

808
01:19:51.239 --> 01:19:55.476
There has been criminal investigations
opened in several countries.

809
01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.319
A real awareness of the dirty tricks
of the football world.

810
01:20:02.279 --> 01:20:05.239
How are those stories received?

811
01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.676
You want an honest answer?
People don't care.

812
01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.796
That's on the news cycle
for a couple of days -

813
01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:19.399
- but the next weekend. Cristiano scores
two goals and everything goes away.

814
01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.676
The absolute paradox of this story is -

815
01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:40.195
- that when the trial started. on one hand
he appeared as a protected witness.

816
01:20:40.279 --> 01:20:43.716
Simultaneously he's criminalised.

817
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.395
He did a lot of harm to me.
to my company. to my family. a lot.

818
01:20:48.479 --> 01:20:50.476
I hope he pays for what he did -

819
01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.395
- and I'm sure
that justice will make him pay.

820
01:20:55.479 --> 01:20:59.876
In the beginning. there probably
was a financial motivation -

821
01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.916
- but I think that eventually he changed.

822
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.680
And I think his goal was really to try
to reveal stuff he thought was wrong.

823
01:21:11.239 --> 01:21:15.039
Those are two versions of him.
A hero and a villain.

824
01:21:17.479 --> 01:21:21.115
It puts your mind in a real dilemma.

825
01:21:21.199 --> 01:21:24.676
It tells you
the world really functions in a grey area.

826
01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.195
There is nothing
that is completely pure -

827
01:21:28.279 --> 01:21:31.955
- and not this other end
which is pure evil.

828
01:21:32.039 --> 01:21:37.319
There is this kind of mess in the middle
that we all are operating in.

829
01:23:54.079 --> 01:23:57.359
