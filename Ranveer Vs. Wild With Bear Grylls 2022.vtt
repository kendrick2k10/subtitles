00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:18.041
<i>Stubbornness.</i>

4
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.541
<i>to come out of your comfort zone.</i>

5
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.500
<i>to break all rules.</i>

6
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.500
<i>to give your life a new direction</i>

7
00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.750
<i>and sometimes being stubborn breaking
through all limits for the sake of love.</i>

8
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.625
<i>But there's one thing about stubbornness.</i>

9
00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:42.291
<i>You never know
what tricky situation it can land you in.</i>

10
00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:21.333
Hey. my imported Tarzan!

11
00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:22.708
Hey. my Mowgli!

12
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.125
I'll kiss you!

13
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.375
don't try and fight the <i>bhalu!</i>

14
00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.000
Buddy. my bad to mess with a bear!

15
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:37.708
It's crazy getting involved
with these bears!

16
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:40.083
Was I out of my mind?
He was ready to make a meal out of me.

17
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.166
-Salute. sir!
-Thank you.

18
00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:15.166
It's for the love of my life.
My baby. My <i>jaan.</i> My Deepika. My wife.

19
00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:48.291
-Oh. buddy?
-A mirror?

20
00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:07.041
-What's this?
-This is pancake.

21
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.791
My mother made this with all her heart
and given it to us like. "Take it. son."

22
00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:37.500
So. guys. let's decide.

23
00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:40.833
Bear Grylls says we can bring one
or the other of these.

24
00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:43.750
The flare or the rope and grappling hook.

25
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.958
My destiny is in your hands.

26
00:04:56.458 --> 00:05:01.541
So. guys. you have chosen
the grappling hook.

27
00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:03.750
I think it'll come in handy
and I'll put it in the bag. Thank you.

28
00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.208
<i>On this journey.
we'll face major obstacles</i>

29
00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:51.708
<i>freezing cold rivers. deadly predators
and challenging weather.</i>

30
00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:03.333
<i>On this journey.</i>

31
00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:08.083
<i>you. the viewers. will be deciding
what I do. and how I do it.</i>

32
00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.291
<i>But with only 36 hours
to reach the evacuation point.</i>

33
00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:13.458
<i>we're tight on time.</i>

34
00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:21.291
Buddy Bear. honestly. I have to do this.

35
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.583
Singh salutes the land of Serbia!

36
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.208
-Come on.
-This is great.

37
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:17.250
I've applied wolf poo to my forehead.

38
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.458
Oh. God.

39
00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:26.666
Now. king of the jungle says.
I have two options.

40
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.291
either I go solo on the Tyrolean

41
00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.541
or he would accompany me on a rappel.

42
00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:36.083
My heart is pounding hard
so his company would ease my nerves.

43
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:39.083
I am scared to death of both options.

44
00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:44.458
So now. you guys decide.
The choice is yours.

45
00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:53.000
One slip up and Ranveer Singh is gone.

46
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.750
I'm shit scared and he's enjoying it.

47
00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:05.875
Oh. he left me behind.

48
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:30.833
Big brother! All okay?

49
00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:54.541
The most interesting thing is that he does
these adventurous things so casually.

50
00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:40.958
You guys are sitting on the couch
with the remote.

51
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:43.375
Here. I am terrified.

52
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:04.041
As I look down.
I am scared out of my wits.

53
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.500
I am scared. What has he asked me to do?

54
00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.291
If God is with you. none can harm you.
Yes?

55
00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:21.208
At this juncture.
I will recite some poor verse.

56
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.833
I have a choice so let me say it…

57
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.583
your friend is hanging in the air…

58
00:16:29.208 --> 00:16:33.500
Bear is in a hurry.
there's a deep trench beneath me.

59
00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:37.000
one slip up and Ranveer is gone.

60
00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:40.583
but we have to try to get that flower.

61
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.250
and. baby. I am going to try.

62
00:17:15.416 --> 00:17:18.958
So. whoever chose this Tyrolean option.

63
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:21.500
I would like to tell you
that this was very difficult.

64
00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:04.041
<i>The tyrolean takes a lot of time.
You have to go at it without letting up.</i>

65
00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.708
<i>But I needed even more time
since I was doing it for the first time.</i>

66
00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:11.041
<i>We only have 36 hours
and 4 hours have already passed.</i>

67
00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:15.250
<i>Don't just press the button but pray that
we reach that GPS as early as possible.</i>

68
00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:22.458
He is a survivor.

69
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:26.125
Whatever you say. he is a hero. Great guy.

70
00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:18.833
<i>We are stuck. man. Now you all decide.</i>

71
00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:22.791
<i>Old-school navigation with Bear.
or go back and recover the GPS?</i>

72
00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:26.791
<i>Please. press the button and save me.</i>

73
00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:38.833
We tried everything.
sweated hard and gave it our best.

74
00:25:38.916 --> 00:25:42.291
Not for "GPS." but "GPL."

75
00:25:44.583 --> 00:25:47.416
Now what? Big brother
will help us reach it. I have full faith.

76
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.000
I trust Bear!

77
00:25:50.958 --> 00:25:55.000
<i>Though the Tyrolean set us back.</i>

78
00:25:55.083 --> 00:25:59.500
<i>hopefully Bear's old navigation trick
will get us back on track.</i>

79
00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:02.750
<i>Hail. Bear!</i>

80
00:26:30.916 --> 00:26:32.750
Two brothers connected by a single rope.

81
00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:28.958
Oh. brother…

82
00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:35.083
this GPS battery dying
has created a lot of issues.

83
00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:39.041
<i>We can't afford to stop and take a break.</i>

84
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:42.125
<i>It's getting dark
and there are wolves nearby.</i>

85
00:27:42.208 --> 00:27:45.416
Come on. All is well.

86
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.833
<i>Saying all is well is not enough.</i>

87
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:51.791
<i>There are only 28 hours left
and the dangers are many.</i>

88
00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:56.250
<i>But I'll give it my all to get the flower.</i>

89
00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:22.250
How can a bear poop so much?

90
00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:26.125
And how crazy is Bear?
He knows it's bear poop.

91
00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:30.166
And Bear Grylls is so crazy that
he's sniffing this shit like it was gold!

92
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.208
Okay. guys. This bear is after my life.
We're short on time so decide quickly.

93
00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:39.791
Either we play dead.

94
00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:43.833
-or. give him an apple.
-We should move back. Move back.

95
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.791
…maybe it will distract him.

96
00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:49.000
-Please decide fast.
-Hey.

97
00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:52.375
-Stay.
-He is after my life.

98
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:54.041
Decide. please. guys. Press the button.

99
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.416
<i>So guys. this was the end
of the day's play. end of day one.</i>

100
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.041
I did what you commanded.

101
00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.333
Even going forward.

102
00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:55.791
you are going to decide
what your brother's gonna do.

103
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.916
Your finger on the button.
my focus on the flower.

104
00:39:16.125 --> 00:39:17.708
Style. naturally.

105
00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:05.000
Everything okay?

106
00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:14.458
-Are all your parts safe?
-Absolutely. brother.

107
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:55.708
-Be careful.
-You look after me.

108
00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:04.791
They are waiting for you. Hurry up!

109
00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:17.375
Oh. wow. my Parsi Tom Cruise.

110
00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:58.791
-Weight that rope.
-Did you see that?

111
00:43:58.875 --> 00:44:00.791
This is what an action hero can do.

112
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:02.458
Oh. please. Just go.

113
00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.625
-What happened? You got scared?
-Just shut up!

114
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.416
<i>We haven't had anything for two days.</i>

115
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.708
<i>It's impossible to survive in the jungle
without eating anything.</i>

116
00:45:46.541 --> 00:45:48.541
<i>We will have to eat whatever we find.</i>

117
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:09.291
-is more in danger.
-Is the bait.

118
00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:21.541
I think you should go and scare them.
They will be scared looking at you.

119
00:46:21.625 --> 00:46:25.208
Dude. this is a wolf.
an actual one. not a dog.

120
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:27.833
-Just go. You're a hero. right?
-You're a lion. right?

121
00:46:27.916 --> 00:46:30.041
You go first. You are a hero. Right?
You are a lion. right?

122
00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:31.708
Why is the lion fearful of a wolf?
Yesterday you were a lion.

123
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.750
-Just go.
-So you have to decide.

124
00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:38.875
should Ranveer steal and Karan scare?

125
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:42.250
Or will Ranveer scare and Karan steal?

126
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:44.875
This or that? Choose.

127
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.750
You choose it.

128
00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:12.583
<i>Dance away. O. you man
Just dance away. dance away</i>

129
00:47:20.125 --> 00:47:21.291
You fucker.

130
00:48:19.208 --> 00:48:20.125
God.

131
00:48:23.416 --> 00:48:26.166
Dude. you have come in
quite overconfident.

132
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:29.541
Lured by the Bear.
you are ready to do anything?

133
00:48:29.625 --> 00:48:31.333
Oh. man.

134
00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:38.291
Loads and loads of thanks to you.

135
00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:42.250
Your correct decisions
have brought us here.

136
00:48:42.333 --> 00:48:45.208
Film is not over yet.
We still haven't got the flower.

137
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.083
So. help us in the journey ahead as well.

138
00:48:49.166 --> 00:48:51.916
Press the button
and save your brothers' lives.

139
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:22.916
You have found a great space. Mr. Broker.

140
00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:35.666
Our humble abode.

141
00:50:30.791 --> 00:50:33.791
In and out. To and fro.

142
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.583
<i>-Opa.</i>
-There we go.

143
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:11.416
They are like pus fritters.

144
00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:45.583
So brother. the problem is that…

145
00:55:45.666 --> 00:55:48.500
-Brother Bear is saying that…
-There's no other option.

146
00:55:48.583 --> 00:55:52.583
…the meat is spoiled.
you can't eat the meat.

147
00:55:52.666 --> 00:55:56.416
Now either it's pus fritters.
i.e.. maggots.

148
00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.041
so would you feed me insects
or the testicles of a wild boar?

149
00:56:00.125 --> 00:56:02.166
You are the one-and-only almighty.

150
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.375
You guys decide now.
We will do as you say.

151
00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:03.291
-You are going. bro?
-Yeah. I am going.

152
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.583
<i>We have much less time to finish
the actual purpose of this mission.</i>

153
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:17.583
<i>We just have a few hours.</i>

154
00:58:17.666 --> 00:58:22.041
<i>We have to find the flower
at the earliest and reach the evac point.</i>

155
00:58:22.125 --> 00:58:27.250
<i>If we get the flower but can't reach
the evac point. we will be stuck here.</i>

156
00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:31.458
<i>And if we miss the flower.
the whole mission would be a failure.</i>

157
00:59:46.458 --> 00:59:50.541
Oh. man. this is no less than a trophy.

158
00:59:50.625 --> 00:59:52.958
At this stage.
if we didn't have a grappling gun.

159
00:59:53.041 --> 00:59:54.583
we would have been stuck here.

160
01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:33.333
You have supported me at every point.

161
01:02:34.666 --> 01:02:40.750
Every decision of yours has been right.
I have made it to here.

162
01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:47.250
Just the last bit.

163
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:50.875
This is gonna be the most difficult.

164
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.875
<i>"Jai Bajrang Bali."</i>
Can you say that with me?

165
01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:08.041
<i>-Jai.
-Jai…</i>

166
01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:09.666
<i>-Bajrang…
-Bajrang…</i>

167
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.000
<i>-Bali.
-Bali.</i>

168
01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:16.458

<i>-Jai Bajrang Bali.</i>
-Yes. I've got this. man.

170
01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:10.208
I was done.

171
01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:13.041
I thought this would not work. no chance.

172
01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:19.000
But somewhere. it came from somewhere.

173
01:08:21.916 --> 01:08:23.583
It's all God's doing.

174
01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:31.291
I want to really.
really thank you guys a lot.

175
01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:36.416
Every decision of yours was right.

176
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.208
You got me here.

177
01:08:38.291 --> 01:08:44.416
and somewhere around here. Bear says.
we will find Serbica Ramonda.

178
01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:14.375
Baby. I told you earlier
and I am telling you now.

179
01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:18.125
I guarantee you
that you won't find a lover like me.

180
01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:20.375
And you all…

181
01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:27.291
your love has given me
all the strength I needed.
