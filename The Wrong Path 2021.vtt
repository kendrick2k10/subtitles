3
00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:07.660
- You're so bad at checkers.

4
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.330
You're so bad.

5
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.422
You suck at checkers.

6
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:11.255
You suck.

7
00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.298
Whoa.

8
00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:15.679
Chill. man.

9
00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.512
You suck.

10
00:02:19.388 --> 00:02:20.236
- Fuck.

11
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180
I'm disappointed
what you did to Roger.

12
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.888
- Yeah well. he's a taunter.

13
00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:28.721
You should try playing him

14
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:30.960
and maybe you wouldn't be so surprised.

15
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.410
- I'm not the one in therapy.

16
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.470
Jack. I may be able to get you out of here

17
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.770
under my supervision. but you're
gonna have to work harder.

18
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.370
- I would do anything.

19
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.740
I bet I can get my old job back.

20
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.573
- That would help.

21
00:02:45.573 --> 00:02:47.883
I will work as
hard as you need me to.

22
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.183
- Jack.

23
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.350
Your mother's not doing well.

24
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.053
It's another reason you need
to get your life together.

25
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.090
- You have my word.

26
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.003
- Hey.

27
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.070
How are your sessions going?

28
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.460
- They suck.

29
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.180
I'm not getting anything out of them.

30
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.380
Why don't you just release me

31
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.090
and let me get out of here full time?

32
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.120
- Release somebody with
your violent history?

33
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.180
- I stabbed one bitch in one bar one time.

34
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.770
- It was your best friend.

35
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.290
- Well. she shouldn't have
been checking out my man.

36
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.790
- I'm disappointed you
think that's a good reason.

37
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.720
Remember when you were telling me

38
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.940
during one of our sessions
about your sexual dreams.

39
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.500
You were being choked.

40
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.333
- Those weren't dreams.

41
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:47.970
They were the real deal.

42
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.960
- I have to help somebody
with their violent end

43
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.270
and anger issues and I was hoping

44
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.800
maybe you would become my
assistant in a small capacity

45
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.710
and of course only if you want to.

46
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.640
- I wouldn't have to come back here?

47
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.130
- Not unless you went off the reservation.

48
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.230
then I'd have to bring you here full time.

49
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.960
- I'll think about it.

50
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.663
- Thank you.

51
00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:27.304
- Marnie.

52
00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:28.646
Marnie.

53
00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:29.479
One more.

54
00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.580
- Jack. I'm not doing this.

55
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.060
Just one more. okay?

56
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.893
Just get it for me.

57
00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:33.726
- You're cut off.

58
00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:34.559
Go home.

59
00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:35.392
- Just one more. Marnie.

60
00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:36.510
- You're hurting me.

61
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.423
Go home now.

62
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.250
- Hey buddy. get lost.

63
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.533
That's my beer.

64
00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.140
Do you believe this guy?

65
00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:54.174
Oh.

66
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.573
- Jack. wait a second.

67
00:05:03.573 --> 00:05:04.667
I just bailed you out.
- No. I gotta go home.

68
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:05.500
Go to sleep.

69
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.333
I'll call you tomorrow.

70
00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:07.166
- Not to mention I drove your van here

71
00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:08.740
without a driver's license.

72
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.737
- Then get one.

73
00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:10.970
- You know why I won't.

74
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.443
- Right because you got
broadsided years ago.

75
00:05:12.443 --> 00:05:13.590
It fucked up your leg.

76
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.618
You're a doctor of psychology.

77
00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:16.080
- What are you doing getting bar fights?

78
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.913
- Just figure it out.

79
00:05:16.913 --> 00:05:17.746
- We've been working so hard in therapy.

80
00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:19.500
- Maybe it's not working. okay.

81
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.003
Do I look better?

82
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.700
- Come to my office tomorrow
at two o'clock. okay.

83
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.350
I have a special session for you.

84
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:27.742
- Jesus.

85
00:05:27.742 --> 00:05:29.282
- Two o'clock. Jack. okay.

86
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.950
- What's this about?

87
00:05:50.837 --> 00:05:52.980
- A customer needs that done by tonight.

88
00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:57.840
- I have too many parts to change.

89
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.810
I got you your job back.

90
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.643
You get it done.

91
00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:03.870
- What so. I owe you something now?

92
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.810
I can walk away at any time.

93
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.187
- Like how you walked away
from our relationship?

94
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:09.750
- Why do you always bring that up?

95
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.500
- My dad's taking a risk
letting you work here.

96
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.330
You quit and the doctor's gonna send you

97
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.220
right back to the loony bin.

98
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.640
No one's gonna hire you.

99
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.707
- You know what?

100
00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:20.813
You don't worry about it.

101
00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:21.646
I'll fix it.

102
00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:23.010
- You're crazy.

103
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.600
Hey Jack. what are you doing?

104
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.273
What are you two arguing about?

105
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.391
It's nothing. Melvin. okay.

106
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:32.010
It's nothing.

107
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.300
- My business will be nothing

108
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.440
if you two don't get
along and get to work.

109
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.950
I was hoping when I brought you back

110
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.610
that you two would get back together.

111
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.500
- Dad. stop it.

112
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.910
Jack doesn't wanna hear that.

113
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.060
- Look. you spend time in an
institution it changes you.

114
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.893
Okay?

115
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.994
- No crap.

116
00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:51.244
Throwing parts.

117
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.324
- I'm surprised you're here. Melvin.

118
00:06:55.324 --> 00:06:56.157
How you doing?

119
00:06:56.157 --> 00:06:57.170
You feeling all right?

120
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.003
- Not good.

121
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.770
It's better I come to work
than sit home waiting to die.

122
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.540
- Dad. don't talk like that.

123
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.723
You're not gonna die.

124
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.340
- Don't worry 'bout me.

125
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.783
Please. you two get along
so this business survives.

126
00:07:12.445 --> 00:07:14.890
- Let me help you. okay.

127
00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:20.266
Look. Pearl.

128
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.066
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:25.899
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.940
Can you cover me this afternoon?

131
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.070
I have this experimental
session with my doc.

132
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.020
I have to be there.

133
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.513
- Sure.

134
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.603
Hope it goes well.

135
00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:39.722
- Thank you.

136
00:07:39.722 --> 00:07:41.055
Again I'm sorry.

137
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.300
So what am I supposed to do?

138
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.030
I'm supposed to stand
here and stare into space?

139
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.610
- Just relax and remember this
is an experimental exercise.

140
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.443
Okay?

141
00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.590
So close your eyes and take a deep breath.

142
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.200
Somebody's going to
approach you from behind

143
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.100
and I want you to respond accordingly.

144
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:08.605
- Don't you touch that.

145
00:08:08.605 --> 00:08:09.438
Don't fucking touch.

146
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:26.074
Die.

147
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.563
- Thank you. Bonnie.

148
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.733
Jack.

149
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.840
We have some work to do.

150
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.373
You okay?

151
00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:25.710
- No.

152
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.510
I was looking for Bonnie to.

153
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.203
She's on a break right now.

154
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.190
- Look. Doc. this therapy is not working.

155
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.673
- Well. you have to give a little time.

156
00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.083
- I still carry this stupid wire.

157
00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.293
You don't have to.

158
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.370
- Can't let it go.

159
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.100
Every time I just I see my
father dying in front of me

160
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.969
and my mother being destroyed by it.

161
00:09:48.969 --> 00:09:50.082
- Dad. wait.

162
00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:51.570
You forgot your thermos.

163
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.760
- Jack. you're gonna have to let it go.

164
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.593
Okay?

165
00:10:15.593 --> 00:10:18.030
I mean. we can't change the past.

166
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.130
And you've worked so hard to become

167
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.210
an electrician like your father.

168
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.510
but maybe that wire's becoming

169
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.400
a detriment to your progression.

170
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.590
- I'm not ready to give it up.

171
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.183
- And I'm not asking you to.

172
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.010
We'll retrain your behavior

173
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.518
and once the anger is
gone. so to the wire.

174
00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:34.090
- You really believe that?

175
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.403
- I do because I believe in you.

176
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.560
- Suppose I should be grateful
to you for not killing me.

177
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.600
You slapped me.

178
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.433
- What else was I supposed to do?

179
00:10:43.433 --> 00:10:45.110
You were trying to strangle me.

180
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.943
- Okay.

181
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.023
- It's okay.

182
00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:48.856
Just let him go.

183
00:11:14.224 --> 00:11:15.820
Hands up. motherfucker.

184
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.653
Keep 'em up.

185
00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:18.403
Give me the fucking money now.

186
00:11:21.537 --> 00:11:23.648
- Do you know who the
fuck you're messing with?

187
00:11:23.648 --> 00:11:24.830
- I don't give a fuck.

188
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.623
Give me the fucking money now.

189
00:11:28.849 --> 00:11:30.073
Fucking asshole.

190
00:11:32.783 --> 00:11:33.616
- Plates.

191
00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:34.933
Plates. write down his number.

192
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.170
- You okay?

193
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.003
- Yeah.

194
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.010
I spoke to Miss Griffin over a week ago.

195
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.840
I'm wondering what's
delaying that grant check.

196
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.590
- Sure she'll get back to you soon.

197
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.903
Where's mine?

198
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.320
- You two should talk about
what happened rationally.

199
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.153
Okay?

200
00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:00.986
I'll be back later.

201
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.580
- Thanks for crushing it.

202
00:12:09.982 --> 00:12:12.373
Peselowe's broke so he
can't buy a new one.

203
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.720
- I don't need it anymore.

204
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.120
I'm fine.

205
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.830
- We both hoped that this exercise

206
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.970
would prove you could control your anger.

207
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.250
- I guess you were wrong.

208
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.750
I just tried to choke you out.

209
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.660
- These aggression control
training works on milder cases.

210
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.770
You're screwed up. but I'll put you right.

211
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.700
- Wow. I guess you've got a new line

212
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.720
of work in psychology. huh?

213
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.830
- Well I know how to get things done.

214
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.250
I'll get rid of your hot button.

215
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.780
- Yeah. I guess if
anybody has a hot temper.

216
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.470
you can just zap 'em.

217
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.920
Whatever it takes.

218
00:12:47.756 --> 00:12:48.589
- Do you think the Doc just thinks

219
00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:51.130
of me as some lab experiment?

220
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.573
- His methods are extreme.

221
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.253
but great reward requires great risk.

222
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.463
Maybe I overreacted.

223
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.460
I wouldn't be here if I didn't trust you.

224
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.350
I'm on your side.

225
00:13:15.778 --> 00:13:17.776
- You're bad news.

226
00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:01.860
- Hey.

227
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.797
What do we got?

228
00:14:02.797 --> 00:14:03.630
- Well.

229
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.670
Don't worry. Charles.

230
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.570
Chief Nelson and I will find this guy.

231
00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:10.948
- The hell did he take?

232
00:14:10.948 --> 00:14:12.260
There's nothing in this dive.

233
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.043
- Charles had the presence of mind

234
00:14:14.043 --> 00:14:16.310
to get the license plate number.

235
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.750
Guy wore a ragged green Army jacket.

236
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.789
- Yeah. with a sergeant's stripe
and a hell on wheels patch.

237
00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:23.840
- Had to be a drug addict.

238
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.517
Attack you with a gun and
get only how much. Charles?

239
00:14:25.517 --> 00:14:26.467
- $200.

240
00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:27.300
- $200.

241
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.913
That's not a whole lot of money.

242
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.210
Devlin.

243
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.840
Was I not clear when I said I don't want

244
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.200
these illegal machines in my town?

245
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.100
- Come on. Chief.

246
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.323
You know everybody has 'em.

247
00:14:39.323 --> 00:14:40.960
I mean. even the firehouse has one.

248
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.800
We're just trying to keep
local businesses afloat.

249
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.550
- Oh. hey. then let's put
one up in the precinct. huh?

250
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:48.560
We don't have the big budgets

251
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.070
that these large corporate cities have.

252
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.520
but don't you worry. Charles.

253
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.290
we're gonna get your lousy 200 bucks back.

254
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.547
What a racket.

255
00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:03.148
- $200.

256
00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:05.577
That's funny.

257
00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:08.170
I thought this place made
a lot more money than that.

258
00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:29.138
- All right. this matches.

259
00:15:29.138 --> 00:15:31.055
- It's an oven in here.

260
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.240
Brenner.

261
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.630
Jack Brenner.

262
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.930
Yeah?

263
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.060
- You're under arrest for armed robbery

264
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.130
at the Hideaway Tavern.

265
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:40.963
- What?

266
00:15:40.963 --> 00:15:41.900
- What's going on?

267
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.389
Hey. hey.
don't fucking touch her.

268
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:44.222
- Hey. hey. hey.

269
00:15:44.222 --> 00:15:45.420
- What kind of cop are you. huh?

270
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.576
- The kind that does what
he likes when he likes.

271
00:15:47.576 --> 00:15:49.037
- Do you have a warrant?

272
00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:50.543
- Warrant for your arrest.

273
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.490
Where's the gun?

274
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.470
- I don't have one.

275
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.133
Search all you want.

276
00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:55.966
- That's all right.

277
00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:56.810
We got a search warrant. too.

278
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.100
- It's a shame your anger issues

279
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.110
have escalated to assault and robbery.

280
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.943
Come on.

281
00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:02.100
- Fuck you.

282
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.160
You're going down. Brenner.

283
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.300
- Everything's gonna be fine. Jack.

284
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.483
I'll call your lawyer.

285
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.790
- He's Dr. Peselowe's latest pet project.

286
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.480
Even gives Bonnie the creeps.

287
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.313
- Bonnie Lang?

288
00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:19.146
Charles girlfriend?

289
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.963
- It's okay.

290
00:16:25.253 --> 00:16:26.730
- Look what we found in your car.

291
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.563
Go 'head. try it on.

292
00:16:27.563 --> 00:16:29.380
- You gonna do something about this?

293
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.963
- Wally. you do not have
a case against my client.

294
00:16:31.963 --> 00:16:35.400
Counselor.
explain some things to me.

295
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.770
Mask. the car. the plates. the clothes.

296
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.020
All witnessed during the robbery.

297
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.380
Explain those things to me

298
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.790
and it'll make it so much easier.

299
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.340
- Your client's under
psychiatric treatment. right?

300
00:16:48.755 --> 00:16:49.870
Bit of a loose canon. are we?

301
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.230
- Watch what you say about my client.

302
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.520
- Look. I'm fucking innocent.

303
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.420
- You may have been born that way.

304
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.440
but you didn't stay that way.

305
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.990
You needed money so you took it.

306
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.800
- I'd be insane to wear my jacket

307
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.130
and drive my car to rob a place.

308
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.450
- Newsflash. you are insane.

309
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.690
Bonnie Lang said so.

310
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.598
- Bullshit.

311
00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:04.431
You know what?

312
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:05.264
I'm out of here.
- No. you're not.

313
00:17:05.264 --> 00:17:06.097
We're not done with you.

314
00:17:06.097 --> 00:17:06.930
Sit down.

315
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.533
- That's police brutality on my client.

316
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.610
- You're watching too much TV.

317
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:14.810
You gotta get out more.

318
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.210
Police brutality.

319
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.490
- No worries.

320
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.781
We'll solve it one way or the other.

321
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:20.981
- What. you don't knock?

322
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.160
You're free to go.

323
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.993
Made bail.

324
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.700
- Now you boys have a very shaky case.

325
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.890
Dr. Peselowe has always been Jack's alibi

326
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.160
and you better keep your
hands off my client or.

327
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.270
- Or what?

328
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.470
- Or I'll sue you and
bankrupt this dive town.

329
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.303
- Good luck with that.

330
00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:44.136
Go 'head.

331
00:17:44.136 --> 00:17:45.340
Might make about 100 bucks.

332
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.237
- Y'all come back now. you hear?

333
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.627
- Come on. let's get on this.

334
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.000
Thanks for bailing me out again.

335
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.610
I know you put it all on the line.

336
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.120
- Yeah. just don't do anything foolish.

337
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.953
- I'm innocent.

338
00:18:02.953 --> 00:18:03.940
You have nothing to worry about.

339
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.990
- I've never been much of a worrier.

340
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.340
Besides. I think the police

341
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.810
will find the true culprit quickly.

342
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.700
- The only thing the cops do
quickly is jump to conclusions.

343
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.160
I don't trust them to do a damn thing.

344
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.993
- Patience. okay.

345
00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.512
Can they just do their job?

346
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.920
- Oh at least let me drive you home.

347
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.980
You don't have to take cab.

348
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.090
- It's nonsense.

349
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.190
Okay. can you just fix the
electrical outlet in my office

350
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.390
like I've asked you to
do and we'll be even.

351
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.720
- Hey.

352
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.623
Yeah. I need to talk to you anyway.

353
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:38.830
All right.

354
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.801
Yeah. I'll just come.

355
00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:40.892
Bye.

356
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.340
- I heard about your
trouble with the police.

357
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.890
Thought we should talk.

358
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.183
- So you can give them
more information about me?

359
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.140
- Save your anger for those who hurt you.

360
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.290
I'm trying to help you.

361
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.830
Face facts.

362
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.123
You make a great suspect.

363
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:26.000
That's Cathy Moffitt from out of the past.

364
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.510
My favorite onscreen hero.

365
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.343
Nerves of steel.

366
00:19:29.343 --> 00:19:32.350
Didn't hesitate to shoot
any man who got in her way.

367
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.790
- Is that normal?

368
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.770
Normal's overrated.

369
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.603
- Is it now?

370
00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:38.293
- A gentleman prefers blondes.

371
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.100
- Where's your picture. Bonnie?

372
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.440
- Got a lot of balls. pal.

373
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.250
Bonnie. what do we run the psych ward now?

374
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.280
- Oh. that's very funny. Charles.

375
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.510
You look like a prime candidate.

376
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.810
- Oh. now you're on his side.

377
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.927
Bonnie and Jack. eh?

378
00:20:02.822 --> 00:20:03.655
- Okay.

379
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.260
- Did he call?

380
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.450
- Yeah.

381
00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.600
Said there's a problem.

382
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.190
- My good friend Devlin.

383
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.023
Have a seat.

384
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.723
Come on. relax.

385
00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:23.556
Have a seat.

386
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.420
Sit down. relax.

387
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.043
Magnificent thread you have on.

388
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.370
And those shoes.

389
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.890
I can only dream of
having a pair of those.

390
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.480
- How can I help you?

391
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.400
Bruno was tightlipped as usual.

392
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.860
- This robbery is bad for business.

393
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.220
- Not only bad. it's insulting.

394
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.720
Know what I mean?

395
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.673
I need a report on this investigation.

396
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.710
- I've got two suspects.

397
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.890
One with a solid alibi.

398
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.580
- Well you know I'm a
respectable business man

399
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.520
and I can help you in many ways.

400
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.760
And I can make Bruno available
to talk to your suspects.

401
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.573
Bruno can be a very
persuasive interviewer.

402
00:21:05.093 --> 00:21:07.340
- I've got it under control.

403
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.201
No one gets away with crime in our town.

404
00:21:10.201 --> 00:21:12.079
- Our town.

405
00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:13.340
Our town.

406
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.440
Bruno. where the hell
does he come up with this?

407
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.273
Our town.

408
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.380
- Oh. I forgot to tell you.

409
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.390
Miss Griffin called.

410
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.070
I'm getting that grant money next week.

411
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.030
- Thank God.

412
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.980
You've been on a bad streak lately.

413
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.990
Some things are looking up though.

414
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.440
Jack has a good alibi in you.

415
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.533
- What. you have doubts?

416
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.200
Doubts are unacceptable.

417
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.010
I must succeed with Jack.

418
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.020
Otherwise you know where you're headed.

419
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.290
- I know where I'm headed

420
00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.993
and what I have to do to get there.

421
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.890
- You're not in jail.

422
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.850
So what?

423
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.220
- Yeah. but if I don't
do something quickly.

424
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.950
the cops are gonna arrest me again.

425
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.320
- Dr. Peselowe stuck his
neck out to save you.

426
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.150
He now wonders what the
hell he was thinking.

427
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.060
- Bonnie. that's enough.

428
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.940
- Okay. you're the one out on a limb.

429
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.120
- Look. I appreciate everything
you guys are doing for me.

430
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.920
If you wanna steer clear. I get it.

431
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.300
- Who else is gonna take care of you?

432
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.210
- Apparently half the town.

433
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.720
Why. are you offering?

434
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.963
- Sure. Mr. Only Suspect.

435
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.762
- Goddamn thing.

436
00:22:34.163 --> 00:22:36.190
What are you doing here?

437
00:22:40.688 --> 00:22:42.358
What. you don't shut doors?

438
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.703
- Chief Nelson's dead set on you.

439
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.210
Whew.

440
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.300
It's personal.

441
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.940
Small town personal.

442
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.780
- You know I didn't do it.

443
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.593
- Even if that's what my
gut tells me. he's my boss.

444
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.567
Somebody's gotta go to jail. right.

445
00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:15.223
I've got some leads.

446
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.130
Like this guy.

447
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.748
We were able to pull a
partial print off your van.

448
00:23:20.748 --> 00:23:21.649
Know him?

449
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:22.482
- No.

450
00:23:22.482 --> 00:23:23.920
Should I?

451
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.107
- I'm betting he knows something.

452
00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:27.907
I don't have enough to bring him in.

453
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.413
Bathroom.

454
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.610
Now Jack. you make any new
friends. you give me a holler.

455
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.460
Oh and don't do anything
reckless on your own.

456
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.041
Okay. champ?

457
00:24:34.567 --> 00:24:37.241
Hey Jack. what are you having?

458
00:24:37.241 --> 00:24:39.344
- Hey. how you doing. Marnie?

459
00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:40.761
Can I get a beer?

460
00:24:41.907 --> 00:24:42.834
You know what?

461
00:24:42.834 --> 00:24:44.431
Get one for this guy. too.

462
00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:47.058
Sure thing.

463
00:24:47.058 --> 00:24:49.260
- Must be my lucky day.

464
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:57.634
- What you got there?

465
00:24:57.634 --> 00:25:00.163
- My bail bondsmen gave me this.

466
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.073
I was hire of the year.

467
00:25:04.967 --> 00:25:06.073
Name's Sharky.

468
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.053
- Sharky.

469
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.010
Sounds like a name of a
guy who would rob a place

470
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.410
and pin it on somebody else.

471
00:25:14.996 --> 00:25:16.496
Like the Hideaway.

472
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.270
I got arrested for that job the other day

473
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.030
and I didn't do it but I guess
you already know that. huh?

474
00:25:26.052 --> 00:25:27.302
- So you're Jack Brenner.

475
00:25:28.774 --> 00:25:31.174
- And I'm looking for the
scumbag who set me up.

476
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.610
Wouldn't it be wise for you
and me to go to the cops?

477
00:25:38.015 --> 00:25:40.192
- You look a lot dumber than you thought.

478
00:25:40.192 --> 00:25:41.413
- Yeah.

479
00:25:41.413 --> 00:25:43.516
Well you're not thinking at all.

480
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.367
- Get lost. Jack.

481
00:25:50.432 --> 00:25:52.424
- You're coming with me.

482
00:25:52.424 --> 00:25:54.697
- Jack. get out now.

483
00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:58.784
- This isn't over.

484
00:25:58.784 --> 00:26:00.380
- Yeah. that's right.

485
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.014
This ain't over.

486
00:26:02.014 --> 00:26:03.473
Next time I see you. you're a dead man.

487
00:26:04.617 --> 00:26:05.450
You know what?

488
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.810
Get me a shot on his fucking money.

489
00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:30.862
What the hell is she doing here?

490
00:26:30.862 --> 00:26:32.097
You need a bodyguard?

491
00:26:32.097 --> 00:26:33.770
- The cops are after Jack Brenner.

492
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.063
It was perfect. except
you hit me too hard.

493
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.224
Time to pay up.

494
00:26:38.224 --> 00:26:39.110
- New deal. junkie.

495
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.397
Next time you wanna get high.

496
00:26:40.397 --> 00:26:42.340
you come and visit your buddy Sharky

497
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.473
and then everybody's happy.

498
00:26:44.511 --> 00:26:45.990
- Are you crazy?

499
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.460
We give you a job and
you're gonna screw us?

500
00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.440
You're gonna pay us our money
or I visit Sharky in jail.

501
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.038
- You both set this up.

502
00:26:55.038 --> 00:26:56.498
I'm not fucking playing.

503
00:26:56.498 --> 00:26:58.700
You were too scared to
get the fucking money.

504
00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.800
Now it's fucking mine.

505
00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.210
Bitch. you pull something on me.

506
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.900
you better be ready to fucking use it.

507
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.550
- Oh. I'm ready to use it.

508
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.403
but more importantly I'm
not afraid to use it.

509
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.570
Don't get greedy. Sharky.

510
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.260
You stick to the plan.

511
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.320
You don't know who you're messing with.

512
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.120
- At least you got more balls
than bitch number one here.

513
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.970
- We made the plan.

514
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.970
We took the risks.

515
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.280
It's time to pay up.

516
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.380
- I'll think about it.

517
00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:26.450
But I'm keeping most of it.

518
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.840
- You better get that money.

519
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.050
You promised me that you
could get me to Mexico.

520
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.370
- I'll get you the money.

521
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.493
I promise I will get you the money.

522
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.050
- You better. Charles. 'cause I need

523
00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.646
to get out of this town.

524
00:27:45.646 --> 00:27:47.312
You understand?

525
00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:39.765
- Hey. Mom.

526
00:29:43.207 --> 00:29:44.540
I got you these.

527
00:29:46.806 --> 00:29:47.806
How are you?

528
00:29:51.768 --> 00:29:53.100
I hope somehow you're able

529
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.933
to find happiness wherever you are.

530
00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.743
I brought you a little something.

531
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.967
Just don't tell Susan. okay.

532
00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:05.796
She'll kick my butt.

533
00:30:15.967 --> 00:30:18.723
It's not fair what happened to us.

534
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.633
To our family.

535
00:30:23.303 --> 00:30:24.703
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

536
00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:27.035
I just cause you trouble.

537
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.420
I want you to know that Dr. Peselowe.

538
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.427
he's tried so hard to help me.

539
00:30:34.892 --> 00:30:37.309
I feel like I'm almost there.

540
00:30:38.213 --> 00:30:40.793
I'll find a way. okay.

541
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.423
God. I miss Dad.

542
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.631
- I said you're not leaving me.

543
00:30:51.631 --> 00:30:52.905
Never.

544
00:30:52.905 --> 00:30:53.950
Don't turn your back on me.

545
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.800
- Okay. okay. okay.

546
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.090
That's excellent. Maggie.

547
00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.923
Joe. thank you.

548
00:30:58.923 --> 00:30:59.756
Have a seat.

549
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.210
Before we call it. would
anybody else like to share?

550
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.360
Benny?

551
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.600
- Why would you call on me?

552
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.879
You know I hate when you call on me.

553
00:31:08.879 --> 00:31:09.712
Why?

554
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.203
Sorry.

555
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.163
- It's okay.

556
00:31:19.222 --> 00:31:22.610
Let's go ahead and stop right there.

557
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.470
I want you all to have a nice. calm night.

558
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.303
Okay?

559
00:31:26.303 --> 00:31:27.210
We'll see you next session.

560
00:31:28.908 --> 00:31:31.350
Jack. would you mind
staying behind. please?

561
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.210
- What happened?

562
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.330
- I met the guy who framed me.

563
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.253
We didn't get along so well.

564
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.720
- Well that's foolish.

565
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.553
Did you learn anything?

566
00:31:42.553 --> 00:31:45.150
- No. I mean. he lost his
shit and I guess I lost mine.

567
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.143
but I stopped before anything happened.

568
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.700
- Well. at least we're making progress.

569
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.763
What do you think?

570
00:31:51.763 --> 00:31:52.963
- I think so. too.

571
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.723
- Okay.

572
00:32:06.198 --> 00:32:08.710
- That was excellent. Jack.

573
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.230
You're getting close my friend.

574
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.530
- Close?

575
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.700
Close?

576
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.050
No. you're getting close.

577
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.853
Close to killing her and
driving me fucking insane.

578
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.890
- Jack. you can stop whenever you'd like.

579
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.600
Just remember we have
your best interest here.

580
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.500
Fuck you.

581
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.627
- It's just a little messy. huh?

582
00:32:44.627 --> 00:32:45.877
- A little bit.

583
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.090
- I estimate the time of death to be

584
00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.400
between six and 12 last night.

585
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.910
There are signs of strangulation

586
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.640
with a wire around his neck.

587
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.660
but someone definitely
tried to play basketball

588
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.720
with his head against the floor.

589
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.750
- So you think somebody bashed
his head into the ground.

590
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.630
- No. it was a single strike.

591
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.520
There's no indentation on the head

592
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.860
to indicate that he was struck

593
00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.743
with a blunt object of any kind.

594
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.750
He cracked his skull from a fall.

595
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.290
Maybe he tripped or something.

596
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.570
- Or maybe the killer strangled him

597
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.070
and dropped him on the ground.

598
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.690
- Or that.

599
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.790
- And there's tools all
over the ground. right?

600
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.143
No blood on the tools.

601
00:33:23.026 --> 00:33:24.960
Obviously a scuffle.

602
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.710
During the scuffle. maybe
the toolbox gets broken open.

603
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.890
- There's a toolbox.

604
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:30.723
Where is it?

605
00:33:30.723 --> 00:33:31.690
I examined the body.

606
00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.350
I didn't see a toolbox anywhere.

607
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.740
- So it appears we can
rule out accidental death.

608
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.573
- I would agree with that.

609
00:33:37.573 --> 00:33:38.720
- Narrow that down.

610
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.330
- Gee. you think?

611
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:44.100
Listen. I spoke to the worker
that found Sharky's body

612
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.453
and he said that his
red toolbox was missing.

613
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.420
- That solves the toolbox mystery.

614
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.363
- So. the work of a mad
electrician possibly?

615
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:55.940
Can we get Brenner back to the station?

616
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.773
Yeah. I'm on it.

617
00:33:56.773 --> 00:33:57.606
- Thank you.

618
00:33:57.606 --> 00:33:58.913
Hope not to see you again soon.

619
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.210
Where's Doc?

620
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.353
- He's dealing with a patient.

621
00:34:04.353 --> 00:34:05.903
I got you some coffee.

622
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.975
- Thank you.

623
00:34:08.975 --> 00:34:10.720
You're welcome.

624
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.970
- You know. you really should think

625
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:14.385
about ditching this jacket.

626
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.530
- Yeah well. I'm attached to it.

627
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.600
- It's hard to get rid of
things you're attached to.

628
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.833
- Like in your case Charles?

629
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.040
- The police are here.

630
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.690
They're looking through your van.

631
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.663
- Oh shit.

632
00:34:31.663 --> 00:34:33.130
I gotta get out of this town.

633
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.749
- Where you gonna go?

634
00:34:34.749 --> 00:34:35.693
- I don't know.

635
00:34:35.693 --> 00:34:36.660
Acapulco.

636
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.800
- Mexico?

637
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.200
Dr. Peselowe said you'd
never leave your mother.

638
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.643
Would you. Jack?

639
00:34:43.799 --> 00:34:44.632
- I gotta go. okay.

640
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.343
Fucking dick.

641
00:35:00.747 --> 00:35:02.003
- Cut yourself shaving?

642
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.840
- You're wasting your time with me.

643
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.040
- Maybe I like wasting my time.

644
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.223
- Look. I had nothing to do
with the robbery or the murder.

645
00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:14.377
- Do you by any chance
have a talk with Sharky?

646
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.287
If you did. be smart to tell me now

647
00:35:17.287 --> 00:35:20.880
'cause this has your MO all over it.

648
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.080
- No idea what you're
talking about it. sir.

649
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.300
- You know. his killer
unleashed a lot of anger.

650
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.303
Very violent.

651
00:35:30.303 --> 00:35:31.136
- Your point?

652
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.800
- Does this look familiar?

653
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.263
- I got all kinds of wires.

654
00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.190
- How 'bout the robbery then?

655
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.050
Can't see Sharky doing this on his own.

656
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.363
You know it's a lot more than $200.

657
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.123
And between you and me.
I don't trust Charles.

658
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.900
Couldn't find anything in
his place or his bar so.

659
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.830
- Oh. so you're telling
me that small town cops

660
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.180
are having a hard time
figuring things out. hm.

661
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.123
- You got me.

662
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.520
You're just way smarter than us.

663
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.980
I give up.

664
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.860
Where's the money. Jack?

665
00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.830
- What's wrong?

666
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.310
You don't have any other suspects?

667
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.860
- Sorry.

668
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.280
No do overs.

669
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.300
You had your chance.

670
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.113
- You think you're the only
one after me right now. Devlin?

671
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.852
- I'm just getting started
coming after you. Brenner.

672
00:36:24.852 --> 00:36:26.270
- Okay.

673
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.920
- Where do you think you're going?

674
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.580
- You would have arrested
me if you had any evidence.

675
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.540
so when you make some up. you let me know.

676
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.593
- You know me.

677
00:36:32.593 --> 00:36:34.423
I'll do whatever it takes.

678
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.163
Prick.

679
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.437
Can I get
you another one. Nash?

680
00:36:43.437 --> 00:36:44.890
- Sure.

681
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:45.733
Hey. Jack.

682
00:36:48.484 --> 00:36:49.817
Where you going?

683
00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.023
My favorite client.

684
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.920
Thanks for meeting me here.

685
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.040
Why were you walking back out?

686
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.670
- Nevermind that.

687
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.920
- Listen.

688
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.960
I appreciate that you met with Devlin.

689
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.483
but please do not go without me again.

690
00:37:10.994 --> 00:37:13.850
That is a dangerous maneuver. my friend.

691
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.743
Yeah. well I handled it.

692
00:37:15.743 --> 00:37:16.576
- Cheer up.

693
00:37:16.576 --> 00:37:17.797
You're a free man.

694
00:37:17.797 --> 00:37:19.207
For now.

695
00:37:19.207 --> 00:37:21.280
Can I get you a shot. Jack?

696
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.140
- Just a beer. Marnie.

697
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.530
Sure thing.

698
00:37:27.653 --> 00:37:30.237
- All I need is my six shooter. you know.

699
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.670
Another private experimental exercise.

700
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.327
Would you let me again?

701
00:37:42.327 --> 00:37:45.703
All these marks on poor Jack's face.

702
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.350
Go take a seat. Charles.

703
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.203
Take a load off.

704
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.844
- I know you want what's mine.

705
00:38:04.844 --> 00:38:06.314
That's not gonna happen.

706
00:38:06.314 --> 00:38:07.399
- No.

707
00:38:07.399 --> 00:38:09.010
Chill out.

708
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.900
Sorry about that. Nash.

709
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.030
- It's okay.

710
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.992
You all right?

711
00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:19.825
Yeah.

712
00:38:19.825 --> 00:38:20.902
I'm good.

713
00:38:26.456 --> 00:38:27.583
- Is there much pain. Melvin?

714
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.810
- Comes and goes.

715
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.460
- Sorry you got it so tough. man.

716
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.433
- Pearl told me about
that robbery frame up.

717
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.680
- Yeah. well I'll manage.

718
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.980
- She worries.

719
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.863
You find the guy who did
it. you'll go off on him.

720
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.320
- Thank you.

721
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.153
- Welcome.

722
00:38:52.442 --> 00:38:53.359
- Oh. here.

723
00:38:55.227 --> 00:38:56.274
Got it.

724
00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.750
Melvin. I got it. okay.

725
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:03.793
- You're kind. Jack.

726
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.000
- Where are your glasses?

727
00:39:08.093 --> 00:39:10.250
- I bought contacts.

728
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.533
Takes getting used to.

729
00:39:12.432 --> 00:39:14.140
Like the look?

730
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.140
- It's nice.

731
00:39:18.077 --> 00:39:20.193
- She wants to look good for you. Jack.

732
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.070
She's always helping me.

733
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.623
whether it's for my
business or my illness.

734
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.367
When I'm gone. she needs a
life with a good man .

735
00:39:33.174 --> 00:39:34.174
- Oh. Jesus.

736
00:39:35.691 --> 00:39:38.333
- Not gonna be around forever.

737
00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:39.353
What will she do?

738
00:39:39.353 --> 00:39:40.353
- I'm sorry.

739
00:39:41.582 --> 00:39:43.415
I'll take care of her.

740
00:39:44.792 --> 00:39:47.300
Got to head out. okay.

741
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.710
Taking off. Pearl.

742
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:49.910
Thanks for the lemonade.

743
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.694
- Bye. Jack.

744
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.510
I think we can agree

745
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.010
that Brenner's not a murderer.

746
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.000
- Doctor. you really think
you can cure these people?

747
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.250
- Cure?

748
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.563
You can't cure violence.

749
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.990
I mean. with hard work and dedication.

750
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.400
they can get a grip on their lives

751
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.810
and yes I stand by my treatments.

752
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.760
- But they're not always successful.

753
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.610
- Oh. we're talking
about human nature here.

754
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.493
- Human nature?

755
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.023
So you treat these people.

756
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.570
You let them out into the world

757
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.903
and when they commit atrocities.

758
00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:32.653
you write it off as human nature.

759
00:40:34.417 --> 00:40:36.510
- Has the doctor told
you he has a few ideas

760
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.230
on how to clear Jack?

761
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.260
He gave me the gist.

762
00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.493
- Bonnie. the people we treat
count on our discretion.

763
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.793
- I wonder.

764
00:40:47.793 --> 00:40:49.823
What did you have to do to get this job?

765
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.473
- Prick.

766
00:41:07.473 --> 00:41:09.963
- I think he must've had
a difficult childhood.

767
00:41:11.147 --> 00:41:11.980
Hey. doc.

768
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.100
- Hey.

769
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.400
- Came to fix that outlet.

770
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.610
- Excellent.

771
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.720
Can you do me a favor and
check the breaker box as well?

772
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.150
- I can't do it now. but I'll
come back later. all right.

773
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.983
- Fine.

774
00:41:22.983 --> 00:41:23.816
That works for me.

775
00:41:23.816 --> 00:41:25.380
I'm gonna go use the little boy's room.

776
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.200
- I was just gonna call you.

777
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.690
Charles and I would
like to invite you over

778
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.860
for a home cooked meal.

779
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.780
- Charles invited me
and you think I'm nuts.

780
00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.780
- Give it a chance.

781
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.624
You have the doctor convinced
that somebody framed you.

782
00:41:38.624 --> 00:41:39.680
Why don't you convince Charles?

783
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.360
- Because I don't care
what Charles thinks.

784
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.430
I don't care if he believes me.

785
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.730
I don't trust him.

786
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.000
- Do you trust me?

787
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.050
I'd like to.

788
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.320
- Wow.

789
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.803
And I let you choke me.

790
00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.650
Forget it.

791
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.810
I knew you wouldn't come.

792
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.643
- Bonnie.

793
00:41:53.643 --> 00:41:54.480
No.

794
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.313
- Bonnie.

795
00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.223
What time?

796
00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.087
Jesus.

797
00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.883
- Can I ask you something?

798
00:42:13.883 --> 00:42:15.697
Between you and I.

799
00:42:17.793 --> 00:42:19.153
Did you kill someone?

800
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.170
- So you don't believe me either?

801
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.664
I want to.

802
00:42:23.664 --> 00:42:25.056
- And what does that mean?

803
00:42:25.056 --> 00:42:25.889
- Well I don't know.

804
00:42:25.889 --> 00:42:27.700
I mean. did you happen to
notice a dead body at your feet

805
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.110
with your fingers around his throat?

806
00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:30.670
- So first I'm framed for robbery

807
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.480
and now I'm some fucking psycho killer?

808
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.390
- Bad luck can make a man or break a man.

809
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.107
That choice is up to you.

810
00:42:36.107 --> 00:42:37.950
And you would be rotting
in prison right now

811
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:39.675
if I didn't lie for you.

812
00:42:39.675 --> 00:42:41.820
It kind of looks like you took the money.

813
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.653
- That's crazy.

814
00:42:42.653 --> 00:42:44.000
For 200 bucks?

815
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.860
Of all people. I thought
you would see the truth.

816
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.680
- I'm not sure you know what
the truth is. my friend.

817
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.950
- The truth is I don't have the money

818
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:51.990
and I didn't rob the place.

819
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:53.770
but I intend to find out who does.

820
00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:54.840
- You have no way of attacking.

821
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.360
- I can fucking kill you
right now with this cane.

822
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.193
You know that?

823
00:42:58.193 --> 00:42:59.026
- Sorry please. all right.

824
00:42:59.026 --> 00:43:00.000
I was just testing your anger

825
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.600
without the safety of role play.

826
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.850
You're an unsteady man. Jack.

827
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.740
- Yeah. well not too
unsteady to take you home.

828
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.573
Let's go.

829
00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.710
Hey. guys.

830
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:24.543
Sorry I'm late.

831
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.293
Brought a little something.

832
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.920
- Bonnie tells me you
think you were set up

833
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.830
for robbing my tavern and that
same guy killed that biker.

834
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.560
Sounds like a two for one special.

835
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.290
- Yeah. frame up special.

836
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.290
- Of course it couldn't have been Jack.

837
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.650
He's such a good little boy
now that my girl's tamed him.

838
00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.310
- Is this what you invited me here for

839
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.890
so I can listen to this crap?

840
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.723
- Charles.

841
00:43:50.723 --> 00:43:51.556
- Charles what?

842
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:53.503
Mark my words.

843
00:43:53.503 --> 00:43:55.373
He's gonna turn on you and Doc.

844
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.960
Come on.

845
00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.793
Open it up.

846
00:43:58.793 --> 00:44:00.513
Let's see what loony tunes brought you.

847
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:19.643
Dead end on the money so far.

848
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.120
- Dead end.

849
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.963
Well. in that case. I don't give a shit.

850
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.340
I want the 500.000 that Brenner took.

851
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.173
- Come on. man.

852
00:44:29.173 --> 00:44:30.525
I'm trying to figure this out.

853
00:44:30.525 --> 00:44:32.727
I'm still working on Dr. Peselowe.

854
00:44:32.727 --> 00:44:33.560
- Charles.

855
00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.130
Come on. you know how this works.

856
00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.840
Either that money finds
it's way back to me

857
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.110
or you become the dead end.

858
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.510
- Doc said that he asked
Jack about the money.

859
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:48.310
- And I'm sure he tried his hardest.

860
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.511
I want you to take this gun.

861
00:44:52.511 --> 00:44:55.371
I want you to find Peselowe
and I want you to kill him.

862
00:45:02.142 --> 00:45:04.593
I need to break Brenner.

863
00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.613
Don't worry.

864
00:45:06.613 --> 00:45:08.570
I'm gonna pin it on Jack.

865
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.436
Now take the gun and kill Peselowe.

866
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.823
You're worthless.

867
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.173
Your girlfriend has
more balls than you do.

868
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.493
Cheer up. Charlie.

869
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.880
I'm gonna give you a temporary reprieve.

870
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.700
but you better come up
with a reason real fast

871
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.370
for me to change mind or
you might find yourself

872
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.570
in the trunk of a stolen car

873
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.799
with a couple of bullets in your brain.

874
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.850
Goodnight.

875
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.163
- Hello.

876
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.563
Who's there?

877
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.756
Hello.

878
00:46:35.434 --> 00:46:36.533
Oh God.

879
00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.143
- Hey. Doc.

880
00:46:56.865 --> 00:46:57.770
No. Doctor.

881
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.700
Doc. you okay?

882
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.559
Doc.

883
00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:01.392
- Hey. Dr. Peselowe.

884
00:47:01.392 --> 00:47:02.943
That electrician van is parked illegally.

885
00:47:02.943 --> 00:47:04.060
I'm gonna need you to move it.

886
00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:04.893
Hey.

887
00:47:05.919 --> 00:47:06.752
Hey.

888
00:47:08.024 --> 00:47:08.857
Shit. Doc.

889
00:47:10.793 --> 00:47:12.277
Doc.

890
00:47:14.914 --> 00:47:16.716
911. what's your emergency?

891
00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:28.780
- Dr. Peselowe got attacked.

892
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.080
Looks like he's gonna be fine.

893
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.880
But Edgar the security guard found him

894
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.907
and sees Jack running out of the house.

895
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.360
- Look. nothing's missing
so we can rule out robbery.

896
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.493
- Well. why would Brenner
attack the good Dr. Peselowe?

897
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.073
- Human nature.

898
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.400
- What?

899
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.233
- I don't know.

900
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.130
- Let's go talk to Jack Brenner again.

901
00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.203
The jackass.

902
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.490
- How many times are
we gonna do this. guys?

903
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.323
- You tell me.

904
00:48:04.323 --> 00:48:05.156
Just have a seat.

905
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.690
Dr. Peselowe was almost murdered.

906
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.420
but that's no big surprise to you.

907
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.430
- No. you know what would be a surprise?

908
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.535
Some good news.

909
00:48:15.535 --> 00:48:17.350
- Well. here's some.

910
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.690
We have a witness that saw you
fleeing the doctor's office.

911
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.600
but that's more for us really.

912
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.130
- Gentlemen. good news.

913
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:24.540
Here's our guy.

914
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.360
Nobody knocks.

915
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.430
- Oh.

916
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.330
Oh. yeah.

917
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:29.163
That's the guy right there.

918
00:48:29.163 --> 00:48:30.560
- Edgar have a seat.

919
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.494
- Have a seat.

920
00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:33.210
What. no two way mirrors?

921
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.510
- No. that's for cowards.

922
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.343
Take a seat.

923
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.560
- Edgar.

924
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.022
Is this the man you saw
fleeing Dr. Peselowe's office?

925
00:48:46.022 --> 00:48:47.500
- Mm hm.

926
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.633
- I want my lawyer.

927
00:48:49.563 --> 00:48:52.070
- You're going away for a long time.

928
00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.310
- I'm not guilty.

929
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.560
I would never hurt the doctor.

930
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.740
He saved my life.

931
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.393
- You beat him with his
own cane like an animal.

932
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.853
Ooh.

933
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.720
An on off switch.

934
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.410
I guess that wasn't working earlier. huh?

935
00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:10.370
- Oh yeah. his switch is still on.

936
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:12.030
This dude is crazy.

937
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:13.530
I don't want no part of this.

938
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.410
This guy is crazy. man.

939
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:16.370
I'm out of here.

940
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.203
- Hey.

941
00:49:17.203 --> 00:49:18.036
Nah.

942
00:49:18.036 --> 00:49:18.869
- Edgar.

943
00:49:21.678 --> 00:49:23.523
- Bonnie just alibied Jack.

944
00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.410
Says she was with him the whole night.

945
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:28.460
- That's never gonna.

946
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.053
- See you later. guys.

947
00:49:31.053 --> 00:49:33.393
- Don't get comfortable. Jack.

948
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:43.470
- Look. we need to convince
them I didn't do this.

949
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.543
- Devlin's got you in his cross hairs now.

950
00:49:46.543 --> 00:49:47.893
He's not gonna let up.

951
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.460
- Swear to God I gotta quit drinking.

952
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.735
I can't remember anything.

953
00:49:53.735 --> 00:49:54.568
Ugh.

954
00:49:54.568 --> 00:49:55.401
Ah.

955
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.210
Find a way to get back to work.

956
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.410
Can you hand me my notebook?

957
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:00.590
Did you find it?

958
00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.960
- I'm sure it's gonna turn up.

959
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.410
- Why would somebody
take your notebook. Doc?

960
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.470
- I don't know.

961
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:06.640
Because there are people out there

962
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.870
that aren't fans of my method

963
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.150
and they would like to see me fail.

964
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.960
- I don't wanna see you fail.

965
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.650
but I do think I can prove
that Jack didn't do this.

966
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.143
I just I need to go home.

967
00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.470
Can you take her?

968
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:19.440
- Doc.

969
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.273
- I'm fine.

970
00:50:20.273 --> 00:50:21.106
I'm fine.

971
00:50:21.106 --> 00:50:22.363
I have some things I need to do.

972
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.890
I'll call you later. Doctor.

973
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.200
Thank you.

974
00:50:38.945 --> 00:50:40.300
- All right. so I'm here.

975
00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.290
Where's the proof?

976
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.850
- Wait here.

977
00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:43.980
- Bonnie. stay away from this guy.

978
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.424
- Don't fucking touch me.

979
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.240
We'll finish this later. okay?

980
00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.940
You gonna be all right?

981
00:50:58.025 --> 00:51:01.015
- Yeah. now you worry
after you beat up her boss.

982
00:51:01.015 --> 00:51:04.260
Already made enough trouble
between Bonnie and I.

983
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.490
- No. Charles.

984
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.100
You do that all by yourself.

985
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.340
How am I supposed to find
out if Jack has the money

986
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.150
if this is how you act every
time you see us together?

987
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:14.920
Stick to the plan.

988
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.840
- Devlin wants Jack in jail
so he can break him down.

989
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.703
- Okay. if Jack is in jail.
we'll never see the money.

990
00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:23.303
Plus. what if he doesn't
even have it to begin with?

991
00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.220
- Just don't fuck it up with Devlin.

992
00:51:27.676 --> 00:51:30.893
- Hey. you don't look so good. my friend.

993
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:34.573
Usually you're a well dressed man.

994
00:51:35.828 --> 00:51:38.460
- Well. maybe it's because
I've been working overtime

995
00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.480
trying to find some missing money.

996
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.313
- Some money?

997
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.810
- I need more time.

998
00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.030
- Look. I've had it with
your excuses. Devlin.

999
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.180
- Nero. I'll-

1000
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.300
- Don't Nero me.

1001
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.850
What do I look like. a fool?

1002
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:56.160
Just get me that $500.000
within 48 hours or else.

1003
00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.210
You understand?

1004
00:51:58.210 --> 00:51:59.870
- It's impossible.

1005
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:03.227
- Nothing's impossible when
you only have 48 hours to live.

1006
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.653
Remember. I own this town.

1007
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.624
Now go get my money.

1008
00:52:28.202 --> 00:52:32.673
- You know. I figured out
who ripped this place off.

1009
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.220
It was Sharky and you.

1010
00:52:36.335 --> 00:52:37.647
- Yeah.

1011
00:52:37.647 --> 00:52:40.530
Wasn't that smart and I'm not that dumb.

1012
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:41.363
- Okay.

1013
00:52:41.363 --> 00:52:44.212
So it was you and Jackie.

1014
00:52:44.212 --> 00:52:45.045
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1015
00:52:45.045 --> 00:52:45.878
My best friend.

1016
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.813
- You knew I was coming
to make that pickup.

1017
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.510
Now I've got Nero up my
ass and I'm out 50 grand.

1018
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.580
- Yeah. you know everything.

1019
00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:59.981
That's what I've come you
expect from a dirty cop.

1020
00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:02.800
Charles.

1021
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.460
You know. honesty. decency.

1022
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.690
They're nice words. but they've
never kept anybody well fed

1023
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:10.723
and I have quite an appetite.

1024
00:53:12.444 --> 00:53:16.720
Put pressure on Bonnie
to make Jack open up.

1025
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.330
Oh.

1026
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.390
You didn't think I knew about that?

1027
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:21.223
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1028
00:53:21.223 --> 00:53:22.793
Not after what Jack did to Doc.

1029
00:53:24.616 --> 00:53:26.986
- Tell your girlfriend be a better lay.

1030
00:53:29.657 --> 00:53:31.280
You ever pull anything like that again

1031
00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.603
and I will fucking napalm
your goddamn world.

1032
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.312
Find the fucking money.

1033
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.087
Ah.

1034
00:54:16.639 --> 00:54:17.803
- Sorry. Jack.

1035
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.283
- She had such a hard
life after my dad died.

1036
00:54:24.764 --> 00:54:26.300
You know. everything
that she went through.

1037
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.450
she just couldn't cope.

1038
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.330
- I'll take care of the proceedings.

1039
00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:34.995
I don't want you to worry about anything.

1040
00:54:34.995 --> 00:54:39.995
- Thank you for everything
that you've done for her.

1041
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:41.780
how you've cared for her.

1042
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:43.800
How you've helped me.

1043
00:54:45.695 --> 00:54:47.745
I wish there was a way I could repay you.

1044
00:54:49.459 --> 00:54:50.762
- Maybe there is.

1045
00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.133
I've always had a connection
with you and your mother. Jack.

1046
00:55:05.673 --> 00:55:07.123
I tried so hard to help you.

1047
00:55:08.967 --> 00:55:10.830
And I watched you improve so much

1048
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.470
to gain control of your life.

1049
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:13.303
- Yes. sir.

1050
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.360
- In your fragile mind.
stopping your father

1051
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.260
in the street is what caused his death

1052
00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:23.523
when actually it was the driver's fault.

1053
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:28.823
- I still blame myself.

1054
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:36.130
I mean. the only facts I have
are that I stopped my father

1055
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.163
and he was killed.

1056
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.533
I mean. you've helped me
so much to control it.

1057
00:55:46.553 --> 00:55:49.467
I mean. I feel like I'm almost there.

1058
00:55:49.467 --> 00:55:52.053
- Like you. I suffer from extreme guilt.

1059
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:56.253
To rid mine has been
a complicated journey.

1060
00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:01.300
but I hope what I'm
about to show you today

1061
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.013
will ease that burden not only for you

1062
00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.610
and bring us both peace of mind.

1063
00:56:32.376 --> 00:56:35.798
You forgot your thermos.

1064
00:56:35.798 --> 00:56:37.930
- You were the driver?

1065
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:38.980
- I was a young doctor

1066
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.093
on the cutting edge of psychoanalysis.

1067
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.910
Pioneering new methods. I had the world

1068
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.483
in the palm of my hand. Jack.

1069
00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:49.637
I was on my way home from an office party.

1070
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.430
I was celebrating an offer

1071
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.160
that I received from Oxford University.

1072
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.263
- So you were drunk?

1073
00:56:56.936 --> 00:56:57.769
- No.

1074
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.033
I never touched a drop
before the accident.

1075
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.000
I've always regretted my decision. Jack.

1076
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.600
I ended somebody's life and
I didn't wanna end mine.

1077
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.623
So I compensated by taking
care of you and your mother

1078
00:57:12.623 --> 00:57:15.267
and I know that's not enough. Jack.

1079
00:57:15.267 --> 00:57:16.100
How could it be?

1080
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.972
I took your father's life.

1081
00:57:43.974 --> 00:57:45.390
Jack.

1082
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:48.193
Now's a perfectly acceptable
time for you to get angry.

1083
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.710
Jack. aren't you gonna
call the cops at least?

1084
00:57:59.025 --> 00:58:00.108
I deserve it.

1085
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:07.420
- Hey. Jack.

1086
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:09.083
- Hey. what's up?

1087
00:58:09.083 --> 00:58:10.216
Hey. can I get a beer?

1088
00:58:10.216 --> 00:58:11.049
- Yeah.

1089
00:58:12.383 --> 00:58:14.233
- Sorry to hear about your mom.

1090
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.780
Are you having a service?

1091
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:19.703
- No.

1092
00:58:19.703 --> 00:58:22.120
No. I don't believe in wasting
money on funeral expenses.

1093
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.370
I mean. what's the point?

1094
00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.253
- Sensitive question.

1095
00:58:27.346 --> 00:58:29.483
Do you get any insurance money?

1096
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:31.780
- Seriously. Nash?

1097
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.360
Right now?

1098
00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.060
You're gonna get your money. okay.

1099
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.923
Okay. okay. I trust you.

1100
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.960
- Someone you don't trust was asking

1101
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.120
a lot of questions about you.

1102
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.963
Stoned and in a bad mood.

1103
00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:47.369
Charles.

1104
00:58:47.369 --> 00:58:49.660
- Yeah. what's new?

1105
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.910
- He was asking me if you
dropped a lot of bills in here.

1106
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:56.413
He invited me to the Hideaway
for a special gambling event.

1107
00:58:56.413 --> 00:58:57.246
- What?

1108
00:58:57.246 --> 00:58:59.280
- Gambling downstairs.

1109
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.113
- Downstairs?

1110
00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:03.460
You know. I'm gonna check
that out for myself.

1111
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.448
- I don't think you're
gonna get an invitation.

1112
00:59:05.448 --> 00:59:06.281
- No?

1113
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:07.977
Yeah. well I don't need one.

1114
00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:09.477
You meet me there.

1115
00:59:14.695 --> 00:59:15.778
Don't forget.

1116
00:59:39.518 --> 00:59:41.394
Who are you?

1117
00:59:41.394 --> 00:59:44.220
- Charles asked me to meet him here.

1118
00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.350
- He didn't tell me.

1119
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.010
- Yeah. well we hang out.

1120
00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.110
Mind if I wait here 'til he shows?

1121
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.760
- Hey Charles. get down here now.

1122
00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.045
Hey. how'd you get in here?

1123
00:59:54.045 --> 00:59:56.030
- I mean. the door wasn't locked.

1124
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:57.090
- What do you mean it wasn't locked?

1125
00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:57.970
We have an alarm.

1126
00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.620
- Well. you better get it checked out.

1127
00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.750
Look. I hope I didn't get
anybody any trouble. guys.

1128
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.920
- The only one in trouble is gonna be you.

1129
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.659
You tell this guy you
were gonna meet him here?

1130
01:00:06.659 --> 01:00:07.492
- What him?

1131
01:00:07.492 --> 01:00:08.325
That's Jack Brenner.

1132
01:00:08.325 --> 01:00:09.526
He's the guy that has your money.

1133
01:00:13.658 --> 01:00:15.084
- Don't just stand there.

1134
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.234
Just tell me who has my money.

1135
01:00:23.234 --> 01:00:24.705
- What are you talking about?

1136
01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:25.750
- Answer the man.

1137
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.060
You killed the biker and
stole the money. right?

1138
01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.960
- That's fucking crazy.

1139
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.733
I'm looking for the guy who set me up.

1140
01:00:33.633 --> 01:00:35.220
- No. no. no. no. Bruno.

1141
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.860
I don't want another dead body.

1142
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.993
I just want my money.

1143
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.518
I want my money.

1144
01:00:45.116 --> 01:00:46.383
Police.

1145
01:00:46.383 --> 01:00:47.216
Police.

1146
01:00:47.216 --> 01:00:48.677
- Come in already.

1147
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.848
- You're lucky you're my client.

1148
01:00:53.848 --> 01:00:56.443
- You're lucky you still have a client.

1149
01:00:56.443 --> 01:00:57.776
Get out of here.

1150
01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:08.546
Those bastards.

1151
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:13.580
You shouldn't
confront Charles yet.

1152
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.840
- Why not?

1153
01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.340
Everyone's fucking with me and I'm done.

1154
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.693
- You need to be careful.

1155
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.630
Those mob guys who attacked you own

1156
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.133
that gambling bar and Charles.

1157
01:01:24.133 --> 01:01:27.090
- So then Charles has to be behind this.

1158
01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:30.200
- Charles couldn't execute a
plan if a bit him in the ass.

1159
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.813
- Yeah well. he sure executed
those kicks out right.

1160
01:01:38.022 --> 01:01:40.690
I never thanked you for alibiing me.

1161
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:42.049
Thank you.

1162
01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:44.020
- Well I had to do something.

1163
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.230
They were gonna put you in jail

1164
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:46.740
and what good would that do anyone?

1165
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.120
- Why?

1166
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.223
Who does it matter to?

1167
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.213
- Me.

1168
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.200
I promised Peselowe that I would help you.

1169
01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.483
So let me help you.

1170
01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:01.710
- I don't need your help.

1171
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:02.543
Not anymore.

1172
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.650
- Then give me the wire.

1173
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.950
- Doesn't control me anymore.

1174
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:20.803
Hey.

1175
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.433
Yeah. no.

1176
01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:24.933
All right. I'll be right over.

1177
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.493
What happened?

1178
01:02:28.493 --> 01:02:29.326
Is everything all right?

1179
01:02:29.326 --> 01:02:30.159
- Yeah. no. it's fine.

1180
01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:31.900
I just I gotta take care of something.

1181
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.720
Look. I'll drop you off at home.

1182
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:45.422
Pearl.

1183
01:02:48.185 --> 01:02:49.018
Pearl.

1184
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:52.319
Hey.

1185
01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:53.152
You okay?

1186
01:02:54.796 --> 01:02:56.478
What's that smell?

1187
01:02:59.965 --> 01:03:02.717
Pearl. where's your father?

1188
01:03:06.123 --> 01:03:07.866
No. no. Jack.

1189
01:03:17.365 --> 01:03:19.770
- What happened here?

1190
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.437
Why didn't you call anyone?

1191
01:03:23.568 --> 01:03:25.274
- So afraid.

1192
01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:29.738
- Jesus.

1193
01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:34.815
We got this. okay?

1194
01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:36.582
We got this.

1195
01:03:36.582 --> 01:03:37.935
Here.

1196
01:03:37.935 --> 01:03:39.153
- No. not the police.

1197
01:03:40.582 --> 01:03:43.209
I have to show you something.

1198
01:04:06.615 --> 01:04:09.365
It's all there. except for 5.000.

1199
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.220
I bought my contact lenses.

1200
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.393
went to the dentist and got my hair done.

1201
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:18.803
All for you. Jack.

1202
01:04:18.803 --> 01:04:20.410
- I don't wanna hear it.

1203
01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:22.910
This money has fucked up my life.

1204
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:23.963
Do you realize that?

1205
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.110
I've been arrested.

1206
01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:28.640
I've been beat up.

1207
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.184
I was almost killed.

1208
01:04:34.702 --> 01:04:36.193
So what?

1209
01:04:36.193 --> 01:04:38.110
You followed me to Charles' warehouse?

1210
01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:38.943
Is that it?

1211
01:04:38.943 --> 01:04:41.503
- Sometimes I follow you
thinking you're meeting Bonnie.

1212
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.950
I was surprised you went
to the bar and left so soon

1213
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:46.870
and at this warehouse I heard a scream

1214
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:48.747
and went in to make sure you didn't.

1215
01:04:48.747 --> 01:04:51.453
- You should not have gone there.

1216
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.363
- He looked dead.

1217
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.400
He swung at me wildly and did it himself.

1218
01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.293
I didn't do it.

1219
01:05:00.604 --> 01:05:01.771
Help me. Jack.

1220
01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:04.351
Please.

1221
01:05:08.353 --> 01:05:10.331
- You put this away.

1222
01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:12.228
I'll deal with the rest.

1223
01:05:37.154 --> 01:05:39.640
- I haven't heard from you all day.

1224
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.250
What happened yesterday?

1225
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:42.888
- Nothing.

1226
01:05:42.888 --> 01:05:44.138
Nothing at all.

1227
01:05:51.967 --> 01:05:53.543
That's my van.

1228
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:56.411
What the fuck is this?

1229
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:06.052
Charles set me up.

1230
01:06:06.052 --> 01:06:06.885
- Okay.

1231
01:06:08.485 --> 01:06:10.127
He's a jerk. but maybe
he's just a fall guy.

1232
01:06:10.127 --> 01:06:12.260
- No. is that Charles' jacket?

1233
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.800
That proves it.

1234
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.603
I gotta call Devlin and
have him arrest Charles.

1235
01:06:17.746 --> 01:06:18.579
Bonnie.

1236
01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:22.511
Bonnie.

1237
01:06:24.052 --> 01:06:24.885
Hey. hey. hey.

1238
01:06:24.885 --> 01:06:28.688
- How did I end up with
a loser like Charles?

1239
01:06:28.688 --> 01:06:29.995
- It's okay.

1240
01:06:29.995 --> 01:06:31.995
I'm so naive.

1241
01:06:33.087 --> 01:06:35.005
- It's not your fault. okay.

1242
01:06:35.005 --> 01:06:36.672
It's not your fault.

1243
01:06:37.748 --> 01:06:39.120
All right. come on.

1244
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.440
- At first it was fun and then.

1245
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:44.423
And now I'm just cleaning
up all of his messes

1246
01:06:44.423 --> 01:06:46.912
and I can't take it anymore.

1247
01:06:46.912 --> 01:06:48.476
- I know.

1248
01:06:48.476 --> 01:06:50.226
It's a lot right now.

1249
01:06:51.825 --> 01:06:54.905
It's okay. all right.

1250
01:06:54.905 --> 01:06:56.427
Bonnie.

1251
01:06:56.427 --> 01:06:57.777
Bonnie. what about Charles?

1252
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:00.930
- Charles isn't coming home tonight.

1253
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.483
Don't you want me?

1254
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:09.460
- I just I don't know if this is right.

1255
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.520
- Right.

1256
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.353
Left.

1257
01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:16.949
All directions lead somewhere.

1258
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.423
- Very nice.

1259
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.563
Playing Mr. Detective?

1260
01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:20.813
- So what?

1261
01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:22.915
You and Sharky framed me.

1262
01:08:23.965 --> 01:08:25.180
For what?

1263
01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.690
The money?

1264
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:29.600
I saw the pictures of
the van in the jacket.

1265
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.120
- You killed Sharky.

1266
01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.043
By the way. where is my money?

1267
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.760
- Killing me will only make
it worse for you. Charles.

1268
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.943
Neither one of us is a murderer.

1269
01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.810
- So someone else is out
there stealing stolen money?

1270
01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:46.858
Killing?

1271
01:08:46.858 --> 01:08:47.691
Who?

1272
01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:52.545
- The only thing we have
left is to help each other.

1273
01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.121
Come with me down to the station.

1274
01:08:55.121 --> 01:08:56.371
Think about it.

1275
01:08:57.370 --> 01:08:58.820
And if you're gonna shoot me.

1276
01:08:59.683 --> 01:09:02.798
you're gonna have to do it in the back.

1277
01:09:28.994 --> 01:09:30.810
I turn around and he went down.

1278
01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:32.357
- Sounds a little convenient to me.

1279
01:09:32.357 --> 01:09:33.190
- Seriously?

1280
01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:35.460
What. are you just gonna
pin everything on me?

1281
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.293
- Let's go.

1282
01:09:36.293 --> 01:09:37.126
- What the fuck?

1283
01:09:37.126 --> 01:09:38.410
Are you arresting me?
- Easy.

1284
01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:39.243
- Are you serious?

1285
01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.076
I called you guys.

1286
01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:41.640
Why would I call the cops if I did it?

1287
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.780
That'd be dumb.

1288
01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.760
- Maybe you're not as
dumb as we think you are

1289
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.400
or maybe you're too
smart for your own good.

1290
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.410
Either way. we're gonna talk
about it at the station.

1291
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.243
There he is.

1292
01:09:49.243 --> 01:09:50.784
Hey.

1293
01:09:50.784 --> 01:09:51.617
Where the hell you going?

1294
01:09:51.617 --> 01:09:52.940
I didn't think you'd wanna miss this.

1295
01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.990
We're holding him on attempted murder.

1296
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:57.920
Or murder if Charles dies.

1297
01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.910
Let's go. genius.

1298
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:00.010
- What happened there?

1299
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.400
- Jack. I heard what happened.

1300
01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.580
- So you don't believe me now either?

1301
01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.710
- Of course I believe you.

1302
01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.330
I just don't understand why.

1303
01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:12.560
I didn't want you anywhere near Charles.

1304
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.460
- Charles set me up.

1305
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.893
Okay. I had to do something.

1306
01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.640
- And look where it got you.

1307
01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.280
Under arrest for attempted murder.

1308
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.630
- No.

1309
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:24.627
I didn't do it. okay. but I know who did

1310
01:10:24.627 --> 01:10:26.640
and I know where the money is.

1311
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.180
Now will you help me?

1312
01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.430
- Of course I will. Jack.

1313
01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.830
We've been through so much together

1314
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:35.053
and we deserve a better life.

1315
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.620
Leave it to me.

1316
01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.580
I know how to clear you.

1317
01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:40.413
- Okay.

1318
01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.573
Yeah.

1319
01:10:43.661 --> 01:10:44.636
Bye.

1320
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:59.807
Hello?

1321
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:04.185
Is anybody there?

1322
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:25.880
- Hey. we're going over to Bonnie's.

1323
01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.280
Jack said Charles planted
some evidence over there.

1324
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.782
- Oh. when did he tell you that?

1325
01:11:29.782 --> 01:11:31.120
Is that before you tried to murder him?

1326
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.620
- Why are you so upset. huh?

1327
01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.057
Friends with Charles?

1328
01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:35.730
- Hey. hey. hey.

1329
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.320
Knock it out. come on.

1330
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.686
Let's get over there. come on.

1331
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:52.560
Where's your boss?

1332
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.200
- Oh. is it my turn to watch him?

1333
01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.300
None of your business.

1334
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.850
- It's right up here.

1335
01:12:05.963 --> 01:12:08.053
- What do you expect to find up there?

1336
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.900
A whole lot of nothing.

1337
01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:13.684
Hold on.

1338
01:12:13.684 --> 01:12:18.027
I think I see something.

1339
01:12:32.777 --> 01:12:33.853
- What'd I tell you?

1340
01:12:43.854 --> 01:12:45.060
- $200.

1341
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.043
Guess that clears Jack. huh?

1342
01:12:48.644 --> 01:12:50.419
- Very convenient.

1343
01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.941
- Gentlemen.

1344
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:02.176
Enjoy your day.

1345
01:13:05.472 --> 01:13:06.305
Oh. Jesus.

1346
01:13:07.198 --> 01:13:08.031
Did you cut yourself shaving?

1347
01:13:08.031 --> 01:13:09.850
- I oughta take you out right here.

1348
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.310
- Oh. you're not happy it's Charles.

1349
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:13.800
- Where's the fucking money?

1350
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.670
- Sorry.

1351
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:15.520
What money again?

1352
01:13:16.933 --> 01:13:19.092
- Oh. you really must be crazy. huh?

1353
01:13:19.092 --> 01:13:19.925
Don't you understand?

1354
01:13:19.925 --> 01:13:22.270
I will kill everyone.

1355
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.780
Bonnie. the doc.

1356
01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.210
I'll pin it on you.

1357
01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.590
What are you gonna do. huh?

1358
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:28.802
Call the cops?

1359
01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:29.635
- Nah.

1360
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.837
50 50 split.

1361
01:13:31.837 --> 01:13:33.930
250.000 each.

1362
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:34.930
Take it or leave it.

1363
01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:39.918
- Deal.

1364
01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:40.751
- Good.

1365
01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:42.880
I'll be back in a half an hour.

1366
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.140
- I see that hand again. it
better be holding my money.

1367
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.452
Half an hour.

1368
01:13:52.271 --> 01:13:53.104
It was Devlin.

1369
01:13:53.104 --> 01:13:53.937
- How do you know?

1370
01:13:53.937 --> 01:13:55.110
- He was at the warehouse.

1371
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:56.450
I gave him that cut.

1372
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.020
- We have to tread very carefully here.

1373
01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.150
Should you let Wally know?

1374
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:01.800
- What. with no proof?

1375
01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.443
He could've gotten that cut anywhere.

1376
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.944
You stay in the house.

1377
01:14:05.944 --> 01:14:07.144
All right. I'll be back.

1378
01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:17.640
- Where's the money. bitch?

1379
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.473
- Fucking piece of shit.

1380
01:14:25.739 --> 01:14:27.261
- Give me the gun.

1381
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:36.150
You go make our arrangements.

1382
01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:38.064
I'll take care of Devlin.

1383
01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.613
Jack. I need your help now.

1384
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.950
- I'm glad you finally came to
your senses about the money.

1385
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:03.213
- Yeah well. it was never
about the money for me.

1386
01:15:04.191 --> 01:15:05.358
- There he is.

1387
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.420
Jack. this is Mr. Van Damn.

1388
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.250
He's the gentleman I told you about.

1389
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.450
- So where's the pickup?

1390
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.105
- Thanks for coming. Wally.

1391
01:15:20.105 --> 01:15:21.700
- Of course.

1392
01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.310
Charles came out of the coma

1393
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.280
and admitted setting up the robbery.

1394
01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.220
but he didn't kill Sharky.

1395
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.580
And I want Devlin to interview him.

1396
01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.998
but Devlin's not answering his phone.

1397
01:15:30.998 --> 01:15:31.831
- Hm.

1398
01:15:32.715 --> 01:15:35.015
You know. it's unreal
that I was framed twice.

1399
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:38.700
Wally. you lived a good. moral life.

1400
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.533
I mean. you tell me.

1401
01:15:39.533 --> 01:15:41.377
You think there's any payoff in the end?

1402
01:15:42.219 --> 01:15:43.130
- I don't know about a payoff.

1403
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:46.010
but sometimes I wonder how
much fun I could've had

1404
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:48.300
if I didn't stay on the
straight and narrow.

1405
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.250
but my wife is basically a
walking Sicilian lie detector

1406
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.740
and I value my testicles.

1407
01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.500
- Got it. yeah.

1408
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.890
Well. if I've learned anything
through this whole thing.

1409
01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:58.820
it's just that money isn't everything.

1410
01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.653
Well. let's get in there.

1411
01:15:59.653 --> 01:16:00.486
They're waiting.

1412
01:16:00.486 --> 01:16:02.080
Pearl doesn't have much family.

1413
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:08.934
- Very sorry for your loss.

1414
01:16:08.934 --> 01:16:09.767
- Thanks.

1415
01:16:09.767 --> 01:16:10.600
Chief Nelson.

1416
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.936
- Chief. very sorry.

1417
01:16:11.936 --> 01:16:12.803
Please.

1418
01:16:41.898 --> 01:16:43.231
- My Aunt Josie.

1419
01:16:44.258 --> 01:16:46.175
- Thank you for coming.

1420
01:16:47.153 --> 01:16:47.986
- So sorry.

1421
01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:49.920
- Thank you for coming.

1422
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.360
- And Wally. this is
Pearl's uncle Seymour.

1423
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.210
Jack.

1424
01:16:54.258 --> 01:16:55.480
Sorry for your loss.

1425
01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.563
- Nice to meet you.

1426
01:16:56.563 --> 01:16:58.310
I just wish it was under
different circumstances.

1427
01:16:58.310 --> 01:17:00.950
You know. Jack here has been a great help.

1428
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.747
He's been like the rock
of Gibraltar for Pearl.

1429
01:17:03.747 --> 01:17:05.785
I don't know what she'd do without him.

1430
01:17:05.785 --> 01:17:09.563
- Have to admit I misjudged
him a couple times.

1431
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:12.490
He's one standup guy.

1432
01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:13.693
- Oh. thank you. gentlemen.

1433
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.980
- Well Seymour. you have my condolences.

1434
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.530
I know this must be very hard.

1435
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:20.363
- Thank you.

1436
01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:23.600
My brother suffered terribly.

1437
01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.563
You know. he was down to 90 pounds.

1438
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.333
Told Pearl I thought a
closed casket was best.

1439
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.923
- Take care.

1440
01:17:35.923 --> 01:17:37.212
Thanks. Jack.

1441
01:17:48.995 --> 01:17:51.861
- Will the family gather
together for the final goodbye?

1442
01:18:35.452 --> 01:18:36.285
All right.

1443
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:19.150
Guests for hire.

1444
01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:20.110
That is brilliant.

1445
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:22.640
That must be a lucrative business.

1446
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.833
You do weddings. too?

1447
01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:27.500
- Well. we provide people
for all kinds of events.

1448
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.117
People just wanna show
their distant relatives

1449
01:19:29.117 --> 01:19:31.950
and their coworkers that
they've got friends and family.

1450
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.850
So we learn a few facts about our client.

1451
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.460
We make them someone.

1452
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.370
- You mean. somebody better?

1453
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:40.130
- Americans have aim. but business.

1454
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.140
Business is good.

1455
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.933
Hope you're satisfied with our service.

1456
01:19:44.974 --> 01:19:45.807
- Later.

1457
01:19:45.807 --> 01:19:46.861
Be well.

1458
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.298
- Tequila. Bonnie?

1459
01:20:10.298 --> 01:20:11.430
- Oh. si.

1460
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:13.073
Hard work being a Pearl.

1461
01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.750
What is the matter?

1462
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:24.743
We pulled it off.

1463
01:20:26.331 --> 01:20:27.530
- You had the doctor's notebook

1464
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:29.280
because you attacked him to get it.

1465
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:32.230
You believed I had the
money and you thought

1466
01:20:32.230 --> 01:20:34.856
that if you replaced
him. you could get to me.

1467
01:20:34.856 --> 01:20:36.850
- Peselowe found out I took
some of his grant money.

1468
01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:38.170
I wanted to get rid of him anyway.

1469
01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:39.330
And Devlin?

1470
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:41.129
How long before I'm next?

1471
01:20:41.129 --> 01:20:42.610
- He lunged at me.

1472
01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:44.290
I had to defend myself.

1473
01:20:44.290 --> 01:20:45.123
Same with Pearl.

1474
01:20:45.123 --> 01:20:47.840
She attacked me from behind
and I had to fight for my life.

1475
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:50.680
- You killed Pearl?

1476
01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.480
How could you do that?

1477
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.460
She was an innocent kid.

1478
01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:56.820
- What does it matter?

1479
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.920
We're going to Mexico.

1480
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.433
- No. Bonnie.

1481
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.320
I'm not going and neither is this.

1482
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.513
- That leaves with me.

1483
01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.963
I told you when I take great
risk. I expect great reward.

1484
01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.263
- Leave now without the money.

1485
01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:22.600
- I'll hate myself if I have to shoot you.

1486
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.833
The money now.

1487
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:26.803
Three.

1488
01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:29.937
Two.

1489
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:34.783
Good boy.

1490
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:38.970
- You're making a big mistake. Bonnie.

1491
01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:43.582
Maybe I'll see you again sometime.

1492
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.010
- I don't believe in maybe.

1493
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:52.880
With me. it's now or never
and you picked never so.

1494
01:22:36.057 --> 01:22:37.594
- Give me the bag now.

1495
01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.940
- Let's make a deal.

1496
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.773
- No deal.

1497
01:22:42.773 --> 01:22:44.462
Just give me the bag.

1498
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:20.403
- That was a stupid move.

1499
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.696
You are bad.
