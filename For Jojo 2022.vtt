00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.750
I'm coming. I'm coming!

8
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:09.416
Okay.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:41.375
Pull it hard! Pull it!

10
00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:02.166
I'm not really into that.

11
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.333
Huh?

12
00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:06.833
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm not into that.

13
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.250
Okay.

14
00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:11.375
That's fine.

15
00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.666
Is that better?

16
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:23.625
Shit!

17
00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:27.791
Oh. shit!

18
00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.333
Can't you think of anything more exciting?

19
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.625
-You fucking crazy?
-Hey. what the fuck?

20
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:24.541
-How long have you been standing there?
-Long enough to see how boring you are.

21
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:30.625
Cool. Okay.

22
00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.416
-Huh?
-Nah. dude. You can go now.

23
00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:35.791
You sure?

24
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:39.375
-Yeah. now shut up.
-Paula. come on.

25
00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:41.541
No. come on. I want you to myself.

26
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.958
Sorry.

27
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.625
You need to go now.

28
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.375
Okay.

29
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.958
Hey. I don't know if you think
what you're doing here is cool.

30
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:57.375
but it's not cool at all.

31
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.250
Poor guy.

32
00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.666
That's super awesome.

33
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
Thanks. yeah.

34
00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:14.416
Oh. man!

35
00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.041
Was that necessary?

36
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.666
Don't be so melodramatic.

37
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.000
Want me to get him back?

38
00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:27.916
No.

39
00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.041
Come on. Jojo.
can't you stay here. please?

40
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:33.083
I need you.

41
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.750
We've been best friends forever.

42
00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:37.125
I'll miss you so much.

43
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.791
-Pauli. hurry up!
-Yeah.

44
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.375
-Oh!
-Paula?

45
00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:51.125
Can you get my suitcase?

46
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:53.125
Paula. come on!

47
00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:55.666
Sorry.

48
00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:58.958
Paula. come on. come on!

49
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:08.208
So…

50
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.083
-Hey!
-Sorry. I didn't mean to.

51
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:13.125
Come on. cut it out.

52
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.375
It's not me. it's the computer.

53
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.625
Go stand over there!

54
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.958
Well. I'll get the food.

55
00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:21.750
You sit here.

56
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:22.916
Hey. look.

57
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.416
Yeah. sure.

58
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.333
It's Daniel.

59
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:31.916
-Cut it out. please. I'm struggling here.
-Jojo. dude. it's him.

60
00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.333
"Him" who?

61
00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.083
The guy from back home.

62
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.083
Oh. you're right!

63
00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.083
That's awesome.

64
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:43.708
He doesn't look so bad now.

65
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.041
Oh. well. sure. whatever.

66
00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:52.708
Hi.

67
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.916
What are you two doing here?

68
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:58.916
-Where are you flying to?
-It's just me. I'm flying to Tulum. so…

69
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.750
Me too. I'm also going to Tulum.

70
00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:03.458
-Really?
-Yeah. What are you doing in Mexico?

71
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:06.916
Sorry. nice seeing you. but Jojo and I
were just saying goodbye. so…

72
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.875
I'm working.

73
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.916
What do you do?

74
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.166
Nothing special.
For a tour operator.

75
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.416
-No. that's great.
-And you?

76
00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:17.291
Um. I'm going there to surf.

77
00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:20.166
You should join me sometime.

78
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.583
No. we have a "no surfer dude" rule.

79
00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:26.500
Yeah. but who cares?
I'll join you anyway maybe.

80
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.041
Cool.

81
00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.750
And what do you do?

82
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.083
For work. right?

83
00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.541
Yeah.

84
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.208
It's funny
how people ask about work first.

85
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.666
-Yeah. super funny.
-In England. they talk about the weather.

86
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.541
This is the shittiest conversation ever.
You know that?

87
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.750
-Shit.
-Oh. shit. we have to go!

88
00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:50.166
-Can I help you?
-No. I'm helping her. Thanks.

89
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.125
-Bye. Pauli.
-No. I'm coming with you.

90
00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:53.083
It's okay.

103
00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:10.375
Cool.

104
00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:12.375
<i>We just chatted the whole time.</i>

105
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.041
<i>His dad died. Do you remember him?</i>

106
00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.750
That's a shame. Your parents are
both dead. I think you're soulmates.

107
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:21.875
<i>Man. you're full of shit.</i>

108
00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958
Where does he live now. your surfer boy?

109
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.291
<i>He still lives there.</i>

110
00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.666
Ugh! In Shitsville. right?

111
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.333
Oh. I knew it!
He looks like that type of dude.

112
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.708
<i>He inherited the farm from his father.</i>
<i>but he just sold it</i>

113
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:35.750
<i>because he. um…</i>

114
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.750
<i>It was too much for him.</i>

115
00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:38.916
Interesting.

116
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.416
Um. on another note…

117
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:44.375
On the subject of the rent…

118
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.916
<i>Oh. no. Paula.</i>

119
00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:48.291
<i>No.</i>

120
00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:50.958
-<i>Didn't you take care of it?</i>
-Sure. I did.

121
00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:52.750
In theory. I did take care of it.

122
00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:53.958
<i>No. you didn't.</i>

123
00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:58.083
Sure. I did.

124
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.666
But. um. can you cover it
for one more month?

125
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:04.916
-I'll figure it out then.
-<i>How?</i>

126
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:15.708
Ah!

127
00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:22.291
Uh…

128
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:23.875
Hello. job center?

129
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.416
NUMBER - ROOM
TICKETS

130
00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:45.916
Ms. Peska. you know
why we canceled your payments?

131
00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:48.625
Because you're assholes?

132
00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:51.708
You violated the application requirement
several times.

133
00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:53.291
They were shitty jobs.

134
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:54.833
No. they were not.

135
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.666
What are you living on right now?

136
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.708
I'm living off my best friend.

137
00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.666
And so the job center is
kind of like your best friend too?

138
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.583
You studied law for six years for nothing.

139
00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:12.625
Only to fuck up your final exam.

140
00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:18.541
I do understand that you're. uh.
lacking some motivation now.

141
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:19.875
I probably would be too.

142
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:21.625
Hmm.

143
00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:23.333
Uh. but that doesn't help.

144
00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:27.666
I don't know what I can do for you.

145
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:30.291
Come to my place tonight?

146
00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:33.916
-I'm sorry?
-Or do you have a girlfriend?

147
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.083
You should bring her.

148
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.625
Don't you want some further training?
Maybe you could learn JavaScript.

149
00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:55.875
Here are two jobs.
Have a look at them and apply here.

150
00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:57.666
Cleaning lady? Really?

151
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.875
-The other one's at a bowling alley.
-Huh?

152
00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:03.958
-Maintenance.
-Uh-huh.

153
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:46.750
Come on. Jojo. can you maybe pick up
when I call? I miss you.

154
00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:49.416
This really sucks.
Stick your voicemail up your ass!

155
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.875
I wanna see your face. man. Fuck you!

156
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:52.541
<i> I miss you.</i>

157
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.541
<i>What?</i>

158
00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:56.875
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

159
00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:57.791
<i>Hello?</i>

160
00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:00.125
<i> I miss you!</i>

161
00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:02.958
-<i>Pauli!</i>
-<i>What are you doing?</i>

162
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.000
<i>Jojo?</i>

163
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:08.791
Jojo?

164
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:11.333
<i>-Um. I can't hear…</i>
-<i>Who is it?</i>

165
00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:12.916
<i>Hold on.</i>

166
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.083
<i>I can't hear you very well. Can you. um…</i>

167
00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:17.333
Don't worry.
We'll talk another time. okay?

168
00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:18.916
<i>Let's talk later. yeah?</i>

169
00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:00.041
<i> Jojo. hi.</i>

170
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:00.958
<i>Pauli.</i>

171
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:02.625
<i>Um…</i>

172
00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:04.125
<i>I'm coming home.</i>

173
00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:05.541
What. now?

174
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.583
-<i>Can you pick me up at the airport?</i>
<i>-</i>But…

175
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:11.291
-Um…
-<i>I was fired.</i>

176
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:13.250
But is everything okay?

177
00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:17.333
<i> Um. I can…</i>
<i>I'll tell you when I get back. okay?</i>

178
00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.166
<i>I'll text you my flight details.</i>

179
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.500
Just tell me real quick.

180
00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:21.416
<i>See you.</i>

181
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.833
Pauli!

182
00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:51.500
Pauli!

183
00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:55.083
WELCOME HOME FROM PRISON

184
00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:57.166
I feel sick. I think I'm gonna throw up.

185
00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.083
There you are! Whoo!

186
00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:04.125
-I missed you so much.
-Hi.

187
00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:05.041
Mornin'.

188
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.166
Hi.

189
00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:11.916
Can we. um. drop you off somewhere?

190
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:13.750
No. I'm coming with you.

191
00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:21.500
Hmm.

192
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.708
So. what happened?
Why are you back?

193
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.958
Everything is so damn ugly here. right?

194
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:32.666
-You ever noticed?
-No.

195
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.625
Oh. dude!

196
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:40.708
What's wrong?

197
00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:44.916
Tell me what's going on.

198
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.125
Come on. keep driving.

199
00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:49.166
No way.

200
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.333
What happened?

201
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:53.750
Was your boss harassing you?

202
00:16:55.708 --> 00:16:56.666
I can't say.

203
00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.583
Why not?

204
00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:06.125
You've got cancer.

205
00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:07.583
No.

206
00:17:07.666 --> 00:17:09.500
Come on. let's go get a beer.

207
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.583
I don't want a beer.

208
00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:14.583
-You do. You always want a beer.
-But not this time.

209
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.416
That's a sign something's not right.

210
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.250
Tell me what's going on. Don't say
you're pregnant. I'll jump off the bridge.

211
00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:22.833
Please. just keep driving.

212
00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:30.166
-Go!
-I don't give a shit. I'm staying here.

213
00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:33.875
Just drive.

214
00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:42.541
I can't tell you right now.
I just can't. but…

215
00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:44.083
Paula!

216
00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:46.000
Wait! You… Stop it!

217
00:17:46.083 --> 00:17:48.000
-Tell me what's going on.
-No!

218
00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:49.833
-Will you cut it out if I do?
-Yeah.

219
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:52.291
-Get in and I'll tell you.
-Okay.

220
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:55.208
Paula. are you crazy? Get in the car!

221
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.583
Stop fucking around!

222
00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:58.375
Hey!

223
00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:01.791
Okay.

224
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:03.916
We're getting married.

225
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.041
-What?
-Daniel and I are getting married.

226
00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.083
-So you're pregnant?
-No.

227
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:19.291
-Then why get married?
-I think he's great.

228
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.125
He's an island boy.

229
00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:28.000
-No. he's not.
-Does he wear a Barbour jacket?

230
00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:29.500
Yeah. but ironically.

231
00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:33.583
Paula. get to know him.

232
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.125
Maybe you should get
to know him first.

233
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:39.375
-You have to marry him right away?
-Yeah. because I want to.

234
00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:41.041
Because it feels right.

235
00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:45.583
Actually. that's not all.

236
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:51.666
You're pregnant.

237
00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:54.416
Uh-uh.

238
00:18:58.916 --> 00:19:00.541
Oh God. I know what it is.

239
00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:04.583
You're going with him.

240
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.125
Back to Shitsville.

241
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.375
I want to be with him.
and he doesn't want to move here.

242
00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:15.375
What about us?

243
00:20:57.833 --> 00:21:00.458
-With cheese?
-Didn't want a million ingredients.

244
00:21:00.541 --> 00:21:03.583
-That wasn't the reason.
-All right. I get it.

245
00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:07.125
Millions of ingredients killed.
Ah!

246
00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:08.333
Are you listening? Ow!

247
00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:10.416
I have to do it now. That hurt!

248
00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:13.875
Paula.

249
00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:20.583
Um… I'm going to the bathroom.

250
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:31.041
Close your eyes.

251
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:33.791
Okay.

252
00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:38.375
You're not gonna punch me. are you?

253
00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:40.416
We'll see.

254
00:21:41.916 --> 00:21:43.041
You can open them now.

255
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:50.375
Welcome home!

256
00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:56.041
Thank you.

257
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:00.500
Make a wish.

258
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.875
Out loud or to myself?

259
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.125
I guess it depends.

260
00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:09.750
Pauli…

261
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.291
Just do it
before the candle goes out.

262
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.000
Okay. I'll wish for both.

263
00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:28.875
Well. then. I hope your wish… comes true.

264
00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:33.833
I'm not letting you get married.

265
00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:37.416
So. uh. what do you want to drink?

266
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.166
I've got beer and liquor.

267
00:22:43.916 --> 00:22:45.708
I didn't have money for wine. so…

268
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:49.250
Um. listen. Daniel is exhausted.

269
00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:51.666
He couldn't sleep at all on the plane.

270
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.166
Well. he can do that now.

271
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:57.208
I'm sorry.
I'm totally dead on my feet too.

272
00:22:58.541 --> 00:23:00.041
We'll do this later. okay?

273
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.583
Yeah. Sure.

274
00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:08.583
Jet lag and all that.

275
00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:09.958
Thanks.

276
00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:12.666
-Um…
-Hmm?

277
00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:35.541
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

278
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:38.291
It's okay.

279
00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:47.541
And I know
this is all really crazy. so…

280
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.541
But. Pauli. I'm so madly in love with him.

281
00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:55.416
I'm completely lost.

282
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.500
I've never felt like this before.

283
00:23:58.583 --> 00:24:02.500
Everything is different. Everything
about this feels right. I know it does.

284
00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:04.375
I want this so badly.

285
00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:06.625
I know exactly what I want. I want him.

286
00:24:06.708 --> 00:24:10.000
It's like I've always known him.
I don't want anything else.

287
00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:12.791
I'm pretty sure
that it's like being in a tunnel.

288
00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:16.958
I can't see to my left or right. I'm just
in this tunnel. this super cool tunnel.

289
00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:18.791
And I'm just completely lost.

290
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.750
I can't see what surrounds it.

291
00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:22.125
It's like. uh… It's just…

292
00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:23.333
You know what I mean?

293
00:24:23.416 --> 00:24:25.750
It's like…
like when you were studying law.

294
00:24:25.833 --> 00:24:28.833
You had that. you knew
that was all you wanted to do and…

295
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:34.708
Oh God. shit. That sucked. I suck.

296
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.500
-Paula. want some too?
-No.

297
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:01.166
-Hey. try some.
-No.

298
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.833
-Here.
-No. I don't like pancakes.

299
00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:06.250
-You made 'em too thick.
-All right.

300
00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:13.000
I'll help you in a moment.

301
00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:23.541
Gross.

302
00:25:30.208 --> 00:25:31.875
You two aren't really doing this.

303
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.458
You're not really doing this.

304
00:25:35.458 --> 00:25:36.291
Pauli…

305
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.083
Can you just be happy for me?

306
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:42.375
Okay.

307
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.000
But I'm coming with you. then.

308
00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:53.458
Mm-hmm.

309
00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:56.750
And what will you do there?
Visit your mother?

310
00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:57.666
Or what?

311
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:02.208
I'll figure it out. There are still
a few people we know there.

312
00:26:02.291 --> 00:26:03.375
I'll make some calls.

313
00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:05.625
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

314
00:26:05.708 --> 00:26:06.541
Mm-hmm.

315
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:08.583
I can't think of anyone.

316
00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:13.750
No. but you can still count
on me coming with you.

317
00:26:18.458 --> 00:26:19.958
I'd like to do this on my own.

318
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:23.708
No.

319
00:26:45.041 --> 00:26:47.000
That little backpack's enough?

320
00:26:47.833 --> 00:26:48.666
Yeah.

321
00:26:50.416 --> 00:26:51.833
I'll give you guys two days.

322
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:55.000
Oh. yeah?

323
00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:58.500
Well. maybe till the weekend. so…

324
00:27:02.458 --> 00:27:03.291
All right.

325
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:07.500
I need to pee.

326
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:14.333
Sorry. I need to pee.

327
00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:15.750
She needs to pee.

328
00:27:15.833 --> 00:27:17.333
He's got ears. He heard me.

329
00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:19.750
She needs to pee.

330
00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:52.416
We're almost there.
Are you ready?

331
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.041
I just saw it.

332
00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:58.583
-Oh God. I'm getting scared.
-What. have you changed your mind?

333
00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:02.208
-Have you?
-I'll show you everything.

334
00:28:02.291 --> 00:28:03.125
Okay.

335
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:11.416
-Well. you're here now.
-Yeah.

336
00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.666
Fuck. we're really doing this.

337
00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:20.541
-Tell me. what do you think?
-Yeah. Yeah!

338
00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:22.708
Yeah? Right. this is our garden.

339
00:28:22.791 --> 00:28:25.416
-Yes. And this?
-That's the door.

340
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.458
-So nice.
-It is. right?

341
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:29.750
Our left-hand window.
our right-hand window.

342
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.166
Yeah. no problem.

343
00:28:31.958 --> 00:28:34.250
I'll carry everything. you fuckers.

344
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:43.500
You can't see it from here…

345
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:49.208
Yeah. so.
if you look at it like this.

346
00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:51.333
this would appear Texas-shaped…

347
00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:52.375
Right.

348
00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:54.333
Uh-huh? Yeah?

349
00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:55.583
Awesome.

350
00:28:57.208 --> 00:28:58.541
Did you paint that?

351
00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:00.583
I painted everything myself.

352
00:29:00.666 --> 00:29:02.416
What will you do with these things?

353
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.125
Um. I guess
I'll take them to my other fiancée.

354
00:29:06.208 --> 00:29:08.625
Don't throw it all away.

355
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.166
-Come here.
-Hmm?

356
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.625
I'll make some space.
Then all your stuff will fit.

357
00:29:14.708 --> 00:29:16.875
Oh. and here? Is this the bathroom?

358
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.833
-Whoa! Is it. is it?
-This is the bathroom.

359
00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:23.000
You can spend all your time here. Really.

360
00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:24.291
I believe you!

361
00:29:24.833 --> 00:29:27.625
-Wow. this is beautiful!
-I carved it myself.

362
00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:30.291
That's. um…

363
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.291
Um. that has to…

364
00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:36.833
Wait. I'll show you more stuff.
What else do you want to see?

365
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:39.041
I can show you
the good places to make out.

366
00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:44.791
-What's that?
-Okay. if you look out here…

367
00:29:44.875 --> 00:29:46.875
Oh. look. look! What is that?

368
00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:50.291
That's how it's supposed to look.
I'll get rid of it.

369
00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:52.333
Don't look at it. don't look at it.

370
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:55.375
-But if you look out here. you see it?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

371
00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:54.791
Jojo.

372
00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:03.333
Jojo.

373
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:33.333
This is horrible.

374
00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:36.375
-Oh. is it now?
-Mm-hmm.

375
00:32:36.458 --> 00:32:37.583
Is it now?

376
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:40.250
Okay then. missus…

377
00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:41.750
But. uh. um…

378
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.125
-Is there still enough over there?
-Yeah.

379
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:48.000
Okay.

380
00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:51.416
In both.

381
00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:52.833
In both.

382
00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:02.125
It's my place too. isn't it?

383
00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:03.708
Dick!

384
00:33:08.958 --> 00:33:11.416
Uh. we're going to a restaurant later.
Wanna come?

385
00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:13.666
Janosch is coming too.

386
00:33:14.791 --> 00:33:15.625
Don't know him.

387
00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:17.458
Come on.

388
00:33:18.041 --> 00:33:21.916
No. I've suppressed
all memories of this horrible island.

389
00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:25.750
He wanted to set you up.
but I said it was a terrible idea.

390
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.208
That's where I always
used to cross the dunes.

391
00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:38.083
-Wow.
-There was a beach behind there.

392
00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:40.666
Hmm! You don't have to look
because of that?

393
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.125
No. I'd rather look at you.

394
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:44.791
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

395
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:47.916
I don't know anyone
who still has CDs.

396
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.125
Neither do I.

397
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:11.541
There's Janosch.

398
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.583
-So?
-What's up?

399
00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:25.583
Daniel's driving. You like danger?

400
00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:26.500
-You good?
-You?

401
00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:27.416
-Hey.
-Hey.

402
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.375
You both remember my cousin?

403
00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:30.875
No.

404
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:33.916
Take the road on the left.
There was a traffic jam up there.

405
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.708
All right. Mr. Navigator.

406
00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:37.250
Mr. Navigator.

407
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.333
Well. how are you doing?

408
00:34:39.416 --> 00:34:41.041
Yeah. so far. so good.

409
00:34:41.125 --> 00:34:44.541
-Got everything done?
-Yeah. And you two? Excited?

410
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:46.708
-Yeah…
-I am.

411
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:48.083
Are you happy?

412
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.458
Are we happy?

413
00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:50.458
Mm-hmm.

414
00:34:52.416 --> 00:34:53.458
Whoa!

415
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:55.166
Shit!

416
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.625
Wow. look at that.
That's so beautiful. isn't it?

417
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.791
Remember our first time here.
Janosch? That was awesome.

418
00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:21.375
Come on. we've seen everything now.
We can go home.

419
00:35:22.875 --> 00:35:23.916
We found you a guy.

420
00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:26.000
So. shut up now.

421
00:35:26.083 --> 00:35:27.666
Yuck! Ugly.

422
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.625
Maybe you. Not me. bro.

423
00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:33.791
You should've seen the waves in Mexico.

424
00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:36.291
-Wait!
-You should've been there.

425
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:37.375
-Hey.
-Hey.

426
00:35:37.458 --> 00:35:39.333
Here we are.

427
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.750
Can you pass me the olives?
Pass me the olives.

428
00:35:42.833 --> 00:35:44.791
Here. here. Dip. dip. dip.

429
00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:46.666
-This is awesome.
-Want some?

430
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.208
-That one's my favorite.
-Kind of salty.

431
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:50.583
Isn't it?

432
00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:55.833
Here. do you want some cutlery?
Or are you eating with your fingers?

433
00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:58.125
Can you give me some bread? Thank you.

434
00:35:58.208 --> 00:35:59.208
Oh God!

435
00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:01.416
Are we really doing this?

436
00:36:02.083 --> 00:36:04.041
-Well. we can leave.
-No.

437
00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:05.791
No. definitely not.

438
00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:16.250
-Ever tried these? Super delicious.
-No.

439
00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.375
Those are the last things I wanna try.

440
00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:20.958
-Okay. Want some?
-Yeah.

441
00:36:21.041 --> 00:36:22.666
-Come on.
-There you go.

442
00:36:23.208 --> 00:36:24.541
Oh. shit.

443
00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:25.791
Hmm?

444
00:36:25.875 --> 00:36:26.875
It's Dani's ex.

445
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:30.708
Hi.

446
00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:34.458
Um… I…

447
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:35.875
Your car was outside.

448
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.083
Hi.

449
00:36:38.708 --> 00:36:40.833
I had no idea you were back.

450
00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:42.875
Um. yeah. for…

451
00:36:42.958 --> 00:36:44.166
for a few days now.

452
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Hi.

453
00:36:46.958 --> 00:36:48.000
Um. have a seat.

454
00:36:48.541 --> 00:36:52.000
Um. no. thanks. Dani. I'll go.

455
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:56.166
Why didn't you let me know
you were coming?

456
00:36:57.041 --> 00:36:57.875
Ellin…

457
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:01.000
I'm sorry.

458
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.875
-Okay.
-Um…

459
00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:06.791
Sorry.

460
00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.250
Awkward.

461
00:37:16.875 --> 00:37:18.708
No. she wasn't awkward at all.

462
00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:24.333
I'm pretty sure
I haven't tried this one.

463
00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:28.125
I thought she looked really sad. actually.

464
00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:35.833
-How are things with you. Paula?
-Huh?

465
00:37:36.958 --> 00:37:39.291
-Yeah. what do you do?
-Stuff. This and that.

466
00:37:41.458 --> 00:37:43.166
What does that mean?

467
00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:45.750
Well. you know. just stuff.

468
00:37:45.833 --> 00:37:46.708
No. tell us.

469
00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:53.125
-I…
-Hmm?

470
00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:54.375
-Um…
-Yeah?

471
00:37:58.625 --> 00:37:59.666
Hmm?

472
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.000
Ever heard of boundaries?

473
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:04.833
-Yeah.
-He's just interested in you. Come on.

474
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:06.708
Paula doesn't do anything.

475
00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:09.250
Hey.

476
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:10.875
What?

477
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:15.625
You started a degree.
flunked your exam. and after that. nada.

478
00:38:17.541 --> 00:38:19.666
-Really. Johanna?
-That's how it is. Admit it.

479
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.416
-You can't get anything done.
-Well…

480
00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:27.000
When I think about it.
we got some fun things done.

481
00:38:27.083 --> 00:38:31.458
For example. we once made a bet
about hooking up with a different person

482
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:32.666
every week for a year.

483
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.916
-Paula!
-So. like. 52 weeks. 52…

484
00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.041
Fifty-two men.

485
00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:41.875
<i>People. </i>you heteronormative
island schmuck!

486
00:38:42.458 --> 00:38:45.541
You fucked 52 people in one year?

487
00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:48.333
-No. we didn't do it.
-We did do it. Sure.

488
00:38:48.416 --> 00:38:51.916
-Wow!
-No. it wasn't like that.

489
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.833
It was.

490
00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:55.000
-What was it like?
-Good. Really--

491
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.208
It was nothing.

492
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:57.666
-It was.
-Uh-uh.

493
00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:02.125
-And. um. what kind of people were they?
-Good ones.

494
00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:03.583
-Hmm.
-Good people.

495
00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.833
Wanna know who won the bet?

496
00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:07.291
-No.
-I don't know.

497
00:39:07.375 --> 00:39:08.208
Of course.

498
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:18.458
Do you realize how embarrassing this is?

499
00:39:21.708 --> 00:39:22.666
My phone's ringing.

500
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:36.583
Paula!

501
00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:38.875
Paula!

502
00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:41.250
Paula!

503
00:39:42.166 --> 00:39:43.083
I'm on the phone.

504
00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:44.750
No. come on. that's my trick.

505
00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:48.666
What do you want?

506
00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:51.833
Hey. are you out of your mind or what?

507
00:39:53.083 --> 00:39:54.583
Why'd you bring that shit up?

508
00:39:55.625 --> 00:39:56.750
It was a great bet.

509
00:39:56.833 --> 00:39:58.916
In case you forgot. we had a lot of fun.

510
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.083
Twenty years ago.

511
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:01.500
-Two.
-Paula!

512
00:40:04.333 --> 00:40:05.291
What about his ex?

513
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.375
What ex?

514
00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:10.625
-Come on. you're not stupid.
-Yeah. what do you mean?

515
00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:13.541
You know. Something's still going on.

516
00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:16.250
Why are you doing this?

517
00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:18.958
-What?
-Ruining it for me.

518
00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:21.458
Uh. sorry?

519
00:40:22.916 --> 00:40:23.750
My God.

520
00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:27.666
-How can I go in there now?
-The same way you came out.

521
00:40:29.583 --> 00:40:30.541
Forget it.

522
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:33.000
No. this is getting really pathetic.

523
00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:37.916
Can you just go now?

524
00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:42.208
Wow.

525
00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.041
Yeah.

526
00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:11.541
GERRYS GRILLCAFÉ
HARBOR KIOSK

527
00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:32.000
Huh?

528
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:34.416
-Dude. you scared me.
-What are you doing here?

529
00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:38.166
Did you sleep here? Are those my clothes?

530
00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:42.125
-I'll be gone soon.
-Where are you going?

531
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.583
You got big!

532
00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.625
Kids grow up. It's a miracle.

533
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.000
When did you get cool?

534
00:44:51.625 --> 00:44:53.041
So. can I visit you now too?

535
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:56.250
Sure. You can visit me anytime.

536
00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.416
I just had a lot to do.

537
00:44:59.583 --> 00:45:00.833
Hmm. all right.

538
00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:06.916
When is Jojo's wedding?

539
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.875
-It's not gonna happen.
-Huh? Why not?

540
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:12.416
She's out of her mind.

541
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:15.416
Well. because it's all bullshit.

542
00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:24.041
But isn't she your best friend?

543
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.583
I bet you this wedding won't even happen.

544
00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:30.041
I don't get it.

545
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:33.333
That's because your brain
isn't fully developed yet.

546
00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:35.208
But maybe it'll happen still.

547
00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:38.791
Listen. you don't have a boyfriend
or a hobby or something?

548
00:45:43.791 --> 00:45:45.458
Here. That's my boyfriend.

549
00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:50.000
You're absolutely crazy.

550
00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.041
I need to go now.

551
00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:55.875
-I'll take you.
-No.

552
00:45:55.958 --> 00:45:57.166
Why not?

553
00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.875
Because I'm going with that guy.

554
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:02.000
-That guy over there?
-Yeah. that guy.

555
00:46:02.083 --> 00:46:04.083
-Looks nice.
-Yeah.

556
00:46:04.166 --> 00:46:05.000
Hey.

557
00:46:05.541 --> 00:46:06.833
-Hi.
-Hi.

558
00:46:06.916 --> 00:46:08.583
-Who are you?
-Jeremy. Hi.

559
00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:11.208
This is my sister.
She was just about to fuck off.

560
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:15.291
-Yeah.
-Oh. Basti told me a lot about you.

561
00:46:15.375 --> 00:46:17.375
-Really?
-That's not true.

562
00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:18.875
Yeah. but she believed it.

563
00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:23.000
Well. uh. we have to go.

564
00:46:23.583 --> 00:46:24.916
<i>Salut.</i> sister.

565
00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:29.625
-She seemed nice.
-Yeah?

566
00:48:09.541 --> 00:48:11.875
I asked you
a straightforward question.

567
00:48:11.958 --> 00:48:13.541
-I heard you.
-Did you?

568
00:48:13.625 --> 00:48:15.625
I said everything I had to say.

569
00:48:15.708 --> 00:48:18.833
Now. why don't you tell me more
about that little bet of yours?

570
00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:20.041
How about that. huh?

571
00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:22.250
Come on.
you're dodging my question.

572
00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:25.083
I mentioned it. so we don't need
to talk about it now.

573
00:48:25.166 --> 00:48:28.208
I asked you a straightforward question.
Why don't you answer?

574
00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:32.208
Leave those things alone for a moment.
What is it with these avoidance tactics?

575
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:35.750
You are the one avoiding stuff.
That is what's happening.

576
00:48:35.833 --> 00:48:37.708
-It's not.
-You don't have to pretend.

577
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:40.375
-What do you mean?
-I was sitting right next to you!

578
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.625
What are you doing here?

579
00:49:14.083 --> 00:49:15.791
I just came to get my things.

580
00:49:18.125 --> 00:49:20.041
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

581
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.291
Everything's great.

582
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.708
What's he doing?

583
00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:36.750
He's going to work.

584
00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:39.125
What kind of work?

585
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:44.541
I'm not really sure.

586
00:49:45.458 --> 00:49:47.000
Ah… Okay.

587
00:49:48.625 --> 00:49:51.166
Do you guys talk sometimes.
or do you just fuck?

588
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.833
At the moment. we just fuck.

589
00:50:05.375 --> 00:50:06.541
Sorry about yesterday.

590
00:50:15.833 --> 00:50:18.041
You do know
I'm going ahead with this. right?

591
00:50:18.666 --> 00:50:19.583
With what?

592
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.333
Marriage.

593
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:26.000
No.

594
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:29.625
I don't think you'll marry him.

595
00:50:34.708 --> 00:50:36.416
What was that fight about earlier?

596
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:40.666
Well. people fight sometimes.

597
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.125
Paula. no bullshitting now.

598
00:50:46.708 --> 00:50:47.833
What will you do then?

599
00:50:48.541 --> 00:50:49.458
After the wedding?

600
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.250
Fuck the wedding photographer?

601
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.916
No. I mean after that.

602
00:50:55.875 --> 00:50:57.750
With me gone and you all alone.

603
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.416
What am I supposed to do?

604
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.041
Well. I don't know.

605
00:51:14.208 --> 00:51:15.666
Just get married first.

606
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:16.750
Then we'll see.

607
00:51:24.375 --> 00:51:25.458
Okay. I have an idea.

608
00:51:28.916 --> 00:51:30.583
Let's go get you a wedding dress.

609
00:51:32.166 --> 00:51:33.000
Really?

610
00:51:33.875 --> 00:51:36.083
-Yeah.
-Are you being serious?

611
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:40.166
Yeah. of course. If you think about it
any longer. I'll change my mind.

612
00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:44.291
I love you!

613
00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:03.166
Hello.

614
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.083
Hey.

615
00:52:13.416 --> 00:52:14.791
Too cute.

616
00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:16.875
Show me. Mm-hmm.

617
00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:20.750
You look like a Karen!

618
00:52:26.333 --> 00:52:28.791
-Look. this is the one.
-That's the one.

619
00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:30.500
-Cheesy as hell!
-Nice. simple.

620
00:52:30.583 --> 00:52:31.708
With these glasses.

621
00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:33.958
That's how I'd get married.

622
00:52:41.416 --> 00:52:42.250
Hey. babe.

623
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.833
Oh God!

624
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:50.958
I love you.

625
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:53.208
I love you too.

626
00:52:54.666 --> 00:52:55.500
Kiss me.

627
00:52:58.416 --> 00:52:59.541
I'll kiss you.

628
00:53:07.208 --> 00:53:08.041
Oh!

629
00:53:10.666 --> 00:53:12.375
-Mm-hmm.
-So?

630
00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:13.958
-Nice.
-I'll try it on.

631
00:53:37.416 --> 00:53:38.333
I'm coming!

632
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.583
Ta-da!

633
00:53:43.916 --> 00:53:45.791
-Well?
-Beautiful!

634
00:53:49.416 --> 00:53:51.833
Please marry me. Jojo. I mean it.

635
00:53:54.416 --> 00:53:55.250
Hello.

636
00:54:05.291 --> 00:54:08.250
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.
Paula! Paula!

637
00:54:09.166 --> 00:54:10.375
Paula!

638
00:54:10.958 --> 00:54:12.541
Paula. Paula.

639
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.833
Did you know?

640
00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:17.916
No.

641
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.458
-You did. I can tell by your face.
-I didn't.

642
00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.708
-Paula?
-No. I really didn't.

643
00:54:26.375 --> 00:54:28.583
I want to get this off!
Help me get this off!

644
00:54:28.666 --> 00:54:29.625
Okay. okay.

645
00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:33.958
-Oh. it's sewn up at the back.
-Hurry up! Here!

646
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:35.416
Wait…

647
00:54:38.416 --> 00:54:39.666
Fuck!

648
00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:49.708
Here. I'll help you.

649
00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:52.625
-Oops.
-Thanks.

650
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:56.916
Stop.

651
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.541
What is this? You're kidding me. right?

652
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.708
That's how we found it.

653
00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:03.458
Aren't you the…

654
00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:05.875
Hi.

655
00:55:06.833 --> 00:55:08.166
What are you doing here?

656
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.750
-Nothing. We were just leaving.
-Right.

657
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.833
You need to pay for this dress.

658
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.333
Well. that. uh. that wasn't us. so…

659
00:55:20.416 --> 00:55:21.750
Yeah. I'm not an idiot.

660
00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:26.458
Cash?

661
00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:28.166
Card?

662
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.583
You're a good fit for him.

663
00:55:47.375 --> 00:55:49.833
Two inconsiderate assholes
have found each other.

664
00:55:53.166 --> 00:55:54.416
Thanks for shopping here.

665
00:55:55.333 --> 00:55:56.333
Have a nice day.

666
00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:16.375
Why did you take me there?

667
00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:19.291
What do you mean?

668
00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:23.208
Oh. Paula. come on. cut the bullshit.
You were acting strange the whole time.

669
00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:25.625
No. Uh-uh.

670
00:56:26.666 --> 00:56:28.833
I thought
what she said earlier was strange.

671
00:56:32.125 --> 00:56:33.541
Yeah. it doesn't matter now.

672
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:35.166
I'm going home.

673
00:56:37.083 --> 00:56:38.291
We haven't finished our drinks.

674
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.666
I'm done for today.
Can I drop you off somewhere?

675
00:56:46.166 --> 00:56:47.375
No. Jojo. come on.

676
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:49.750
I'm sorry. Can't we talk about it?

677
00:56:50.583 --> 00:56:51.500
Thanks. but no.

678
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:55.208
Can't you just stay with me for once?

679
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:57.666
I just told you I'm going home.

680
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.875
Why are you so angry all of a sudden?

681
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:04.750
Wait a minute.

682
00:57:11.041 --> 00:57:12.416
Just stop.

683
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.500
-Jojo!
-Please get out!

684
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:17.666
Jojo. don't be so angry. okay?

685
00:58:16.333 --> 00:58:18.375
-Everything good?
-Hey!

686
00:58:18.458 --> 00:58:19.833
Good to see you. man.

687
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:22.958
Mind if I grab a few?

688
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:28.750
I'll be right back.

689
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.375
The only thing I like
about this shitty island is the kiosk.

690
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:48.375
-So. what happened?
-Hmm?

691
00:58:49.416 --> 00:58:51.125
To make you hate it so much.

692
00:58:55.375 --> 00:58:56.291
Okay. I get it.

693
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:06.625
And you?

694
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.458
Why do you like it here?

695
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.833
I don't know. I guess it's just home.

696
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.750
My home is Jojo.

697
00:59:52.875 --> 00:59:53.708
What's up?

698
01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:01.500
That's my uncle.

699
01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:04.250
My uncle was the first surfer
on the island.

700
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:06.041
Great.

701
01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:10.083
Hey! Good to see you. brother.

702
01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.541
-This is Paula.
-Hey.

703
01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:14.958
Hi.

704
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.416
-Paula. you want a beer?
-Yeah.

705
01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:26.583
Good to see you.

706
01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:37.250
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah. totally.

707
01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:18.208
Hey.

708
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.500
Well. he's still arguing
with a random guy in France

709
01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:48.416
who claims he was the first to surf.
but that's not true.

710
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.583
My grandpa was already surfing in 1952.

711
01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:57.333
He saw it on the news. people surfing
on these weird boards in Hawaii.

712
01:01:58.125 --> 01:02:00.458
At the time.
only the royal family could do it.

713
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.458
He was a lifeguard. so he got a hold
of a board and just went surfing.

714
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:08.791
Do you like surfing?

715
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.833
Honestly?

716
01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah.

717
01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.208
I think it's stupid.

718
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.250
How can you think it's stupid?

719
01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.708
I'm scared of the sea.

720
01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:30.916
You're from here.

721
01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:35.583
The sea is all around us.
How are you scared of it?

722
01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:38.375
I don't know.

723
01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:43.416
You're funny.

724
01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:45.958
How would you know?

725
01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:48.625
No idea. Aren't you?

726
01:02:53.708 --> 01:02:56.416
How do you know what someone's like
before getting to know them?

727
01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:02.041
Intuition?

728
01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.791
-I think I'd better go back in.
-Now?

729
01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:13.708
Yeah.

730
01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.375
Can I sleep at your place?

731
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:22.541
I don't think so.

732
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:26.541
Why not?

733
01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:30.666
No idea.

734
01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:33.541
Okay.

735
01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:36.958
Take care.

736
01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:11.708
Basti?

737
01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:36.125
You again.

738
01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:39.791
What time is it?

739
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.875
Almost two.

740
01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:47.875
I could sleep all the time.

741
01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah. another form of denial.

742
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.583
You look like shit too.

743
01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.291
Who was that guy the other day?

744
01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:59.166
That's none of your business.

745
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.416
Are you in love or something?

746
01:06:04.666 --> 01:06:06.625
Oh. he's just an exchange student.

747
01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.500
He'll be gone soon.
I won't let my heart get broken.

748
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.333
And you?

749
01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:21.583
I heard something was going on
between you and Janosch.

750
01:06:23.041 --> 01:06:23.875
No.

751
01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:28.333
I won't let my heart get broken either.

752
01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.791
So. are we both
really clever or really dumb?

753
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.041
Come here.

754
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:03.083
-What are you doing here?
-I was looking for you.

755
01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:07.208
Cut the bullshit.
Right in front of his ex's shop?

756
01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:10.375
We had a fight.

757
01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:12.125
Who?

758
01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.375
The Pope and I. Come on. Paula.

759
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.333
Why?

760
01:07:19.916 --> 01:07:21.916
I asked him again about Ellin. and then…

761
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.416
he suddenly got kind of weird.
so I thought…

762
01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:27.416
I'd ask her.

763
01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:31.208
Ask her?

764
01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:33.375
I feel like shit.

765
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:36.291
-That's a good idea.
-No. it's a really shit idea.

766
01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:40.833
I feel like I cheated on him.
I didn't even talk to her yet.

767
01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:45.041
What's really going on?

768
01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:48.666
I don't know.

769
01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:50.708
Tell me.

770
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.916
I've no idea.

771
01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:00.541
Everything has just changed
since we got here.

772
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:03.333
It's so serious.

773
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.583
What if we go visit your mom?

774
01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:14.750
Yeah.

775
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.333
We were lucky she hit a rock.

776
01:08:57.958 --> 01:08:59.958
Just imagine all that hassle with a bib

777
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:02.208
and cleaning up the drool
and all that shit.

778
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500
Well done. Ulrike!

779
01:09:12.083 --> 01:09:13.208
Well done…

780
01:09:13.958 --> 01:09:14.958
Mama!

781
01:09:23.583 --> 01:09:26.333
Your mom jumped because she saw
no other way out of her marriage.

782
01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:28.000
You do realize that. don't you?

783
01:09:33.833 --> 01:09:34.875
Oh. Pauli.

784
01:09:36.583 --> 01:09:38.333
It's not as simple as that.

785
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:42.125
It's not?

786
01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:52.208
I know exactly what I want.

787
01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:54.375
Why are you crying. then?

788
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.583
Because we had a fight. It's no big deal.

789
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:05.041
Who are you trying to fool?

790
01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:10.375
Tell me. can you only be happy
when I feel like shit? Is that it?

791
01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:12.666
Jojo. you know
that's not what this is about.

792
01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:17.666
I just want you to realize how…
how shitty it actually is here.

793
01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:45.250
Well done. Jojo!

794
01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:48.791
Jojo!

795
01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:51.708
Jojo!

796
01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:54.083
Jojo?

797
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:56.958
Jojo!

798
01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.291
Jojo!

799
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:44.041
So. I guess I'll be off.

800
01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:47.000
Okay.

801
01:13:51.083 --> 01:13:53.208
Um. was that it. then?

802
01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:56.083
What do you mean?

803
01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:01.791
No idea.
I don't know what I mean either.

804
01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:08.708
I'm sure you girls do this
in Berlin all the time. don't you?

805
01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:14.625
Yeah.

806
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.458
I guess so. yeah.

807
01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:36.875
Don't you want to come to bed?

808
01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:10.375
Sorry.

809
01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:13.625
What are you doing here?

810
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.541
I wanted to apologize.

811
01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:20.291
You already paid for the dress. It's okay.

812
01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:22.750
Yeah. but I'm sorry about our behavior.

813
01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.750
In theory. we're actually still together.

814
01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.041
What?

815
01:19:04.916 --> 01:19:05.750
Charge!

816
01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:15.916
Move in!

817
01:19:19.791 --> 01:19:20.625
Paula…

818
01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:22.166
Move in!

819
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.166
Paula. we shouldn't be here.

820
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:28.083
Retreat.

821
01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:30.541
Retreat.

822
01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:35.500
Retreat!

823
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.833
Ellin. what are you doing here?

824
01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:53.708
Hey. yo.

825
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.833
Hey. Have you two been drinking?

826
01:19:57.333 --> 01:20:00.083
Nah. just an aperitif. A small one.

827
01:20:00.166 --> 01:20:01.125
Can we come in?

828
01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:06.208
-Can I come in too?
-Please do. madam. Come right in! Jojo!

829
01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:09.958
Paula! Hey. we have so much to eat.

830
01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.958
Janosch brought
a couple of bottles of wine too.

831
01:20:14.333 --> 01:20:17.416
-Come. I'll show you the fish!
-I need to talk to you.

832
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.666
All right.
wait a second. I just have to. um…

833
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:23.250
What is it?

834
01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:24.833
I brought someone with me. so…

835
01:20:25.458 --> 01:20:27.791
I see. Cool.
That's cool. Uh. who is it?

836
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.958
Well. maybe you're gonna hate me now.

837
01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:34.208
but that's okay because maybe
you won't hate me so much one day.

838
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:35.875
What are you saying? Huh?

839
01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:41.250
Dani?

840
01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:44.458
Paula…

841
01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:47.041
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

842
01:20:50.166 --> 01:20:51.500
What are you doing here?

843
01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:53.750
I just told you I brought her.

844
01:20:55.791 --> 01:20:56.958
Uh. sure.

845
01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:00.666
Uh. do you girls want a drink?

846
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.041
-No.
-Yep. sure. Great.

847
01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:03.166
-Uh…
-White wine?

848
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:04.125
Uh-uh.

849
01:21:04.208 --> 01:21:07.208
Paula? Paula.
can we go outside for a second?

850
01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:10.916
Yeah. but now's not such a good time.
We have a guest. That'd be rude.

851
01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:12.541
Yeah.

852
01:21:13.125 --> 01:21:14.000
Uh…

853
01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:16.916
Hi. I'm Jojo.

854
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.833
-Would you like a drink?
-No. thanks.

855
01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.083
Yeah. sure. Just give her a glass of wine.

856
01:21:22.166 --> 01:21:23.916
No. I'll do it. Um…

857
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.041
Here. There you go.

858
01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:27.458
Oh!

859
01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:30.875
-It's okay. I'll get something.
-No. just leave it there.

860
01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:33.250
It's no problem.
Tell me where the bucket is.

861
01:21:33.333 --> 01:21:35.291
-Leave it.
-Are you his maid?

862
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.333
-I said it's no problem.
-Just leave it.

863
01:21:38.416 --> 01:21:40.583
It's okay.
Just tell me where it is. please.

864
01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:42.583
Under the sink next to the trash bin!

865
01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:45.708
It's okay. I'll get it.

866
01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.625
Ellin. please. just stay…

867
01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:50.541
Just…

868
01:21:53.083 --> 01:21:56.250
Paula. can you tell me
exactly why you brought her here. hmm?

869
01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.541
Johanna. can you chill
for just five seconds?

870
01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:01.125
Uh. Jojo. I think we need to talk.

871
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.916
-Talk to me? Yeah?
-Yep.

872
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.208
-Oh.
-Yep.

873
01:22:06.916 --> 01:22:09.666
That was so obvious.
Could you just shut up for once?

874
01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.208
What is it?

875
01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:14.458
It's. um. it's…

876
01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:19.625
No. Ellin. leave it.

877
01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.958
-Come on. Ellin. I'll do it.
-I'll do it.

878
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:23.875
-I can do it too. I said--
-Leave it.

879
01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:25.291
-I'll do it.
-I'm doing it!

880
01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.208
Okay.

881
01:22:30.375 --> 01:22:31.208
Okay.

882
01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:32.958
Good.

883
01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:35.166
Well. then…

884
01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.833
Then. uh. let's all just sit down now.

885
01:22:39.291 --> 01:22:41.458
Yeah. Ellin.
where do you wanna sit?

886
01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:47.333
Daniel. what's going on here?

887
01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:55.833
I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to you.
but. um… but not now.

888
01:22:56.708 --> 01:22:59.208
-Huh? What's going on here right now?
-Hey.

889
01:22:59.291 --> 01:23:03.125
What are you sorry about exactly?
The fact that she's still your girlfriend?

890
01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:06.791
-What? That's not true.
-When did you break up with me?

891
01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:08.708
I… I said I needed some space. so…

892
01:23:08.791 --> 01:23:11.291
When you two met.
he was still with me.

893
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:16.958
And when you two decided to get married.
that whole time. he was still with me.

894
01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:18.125
-And when you--
-Dude!

895
01:23:18.208 --> 01:23:21.791
When you go to fucking Mexico and say
you need space. the message just…

896
01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:22.958
It's pretty clear.

897
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.125
No.

898
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.208
You wrote to me all the time.

899
01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:32.041
Is that true?

900
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:35.125
Yeah. because I…

901
01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:39.041
um. because…
'cause you're important to me.

902
01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:39.958
Okay.

903
01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:42.875
Uh… That's. uh…

904
01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:44.791
That's interesting… too.

905
01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.833
And because I was worried
about you. you know?

906
01:23:47.916 --> 01:23:50.916
I want you to be okay.
I… don't want to hurt you.

907
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.333
-So…
-What the hell's going on right now?

908
01:23:53.416 --> 01:23:55.083
This isn't doing any good at all.

909
01:23:58.916 --> 01:24:00.333
I was gonna tell you.

910
01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:01.250
Well. when?

911
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:05.583
Tell me when?
After this absurd wedding. or…?

912
01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.625
I don't understand why you're so angry.

913
01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:10.125
It… It has…
It really has nothing to do with you.

914
01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:12.083
What. are you dumb?

915
01:24:12.166 --> 01:24:14.291
Listen. you have no right to interfere.

916
01:24:14.375 --> 01:24:15.625
-None at all.
-What?

917
01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:19.750
I'm not interfering. I'm just
protecting her from fuckers like you!

918
01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:23.041
-I don't get what your fucking problem is!
-Just leave her alone!

919
01:24:26.708 --> 01:24:27.541
No.

920
01:24:50.333 --> 01:24:51.166
Hey!

921
01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:48.916
What the hell is this?

922
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.750
Your relationship
was based on a pile of shit.

923
01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:59.000
-And I feel really bad for Ellin.
-Excuse me?

924
01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:07.666
I think you should be thanking me.
actually.

925
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:12.833
Why show me up like that.
in front of everyone?

926
01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:15.708
You wouldn't listen otherwise.

927
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.000
Come on. the guy's an asshole.

928
01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:24.291
Get that into your head for once!
He doesn't need you.

929
01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:27.083
But I need you.

930
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.750
Paula. you're absolutely nuts.
Have you completely lost your mind?

931
01:26:32.375 --> 01:26:33.708
You're a psycho. Paula.

932
01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:34.708
A wreck!

933
01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:37.916
You're a completely deranged lunatic.

934
01:26:39.666 --> 01:26:42.291
Do you enjoy dragging others
into your shit? Hmm?

935
01:26:42.791 --> 01:26:44.291
Do you get a kick out of that?

936
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:49.666
What do you actually want?
What are you doing here?

937
01:26:50.666 --> 01:26:53.000
Get a grip on your life
and let me live mine!

938
01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:59.583
Stop interfering all the time.
for the love of God!

939
01:27:16.208 --> 01:27:17.291
Do you need help?

940
01:27:17.875 --> 01:27:20.291
No. I'm fine.

941
01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.833
Or maybe… Do you have a drink for me?

942
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:25.791
Sure.

943
01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:36.583
-Where are you from?
-Denmark.

944
01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:39.708
I'm Olli. and this is Freja.

945
01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:43.750
I'm Paula. and this is Karen Heiner.

946
01:27:45.166 --> 01:27:48.208
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Are you from here?

947
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:49.791
Yes and no.

948
01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:52.708
You wanna get a drink with us?

949
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:55.625
Actually. we were just about
to take a tour on our quads.

950
01:27:56.666 --> 01:27:58.916
Hey. maybe…
maybe you can come with us?

951
01:27:59.916 --> 01:28:02.083
Hmm… Yeah.

952
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.541
Why not? We love quads.

953
01:28:04.625 --> 01:28:05.750
Right. Karen Heiner?

954
01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:08.833
What the hell are quads?

955
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:14.333
Nice.

956
01:29:42.458 --> 01:29:43.666
Let's go home tomorrow.

957
01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:53.083
I need you.

958
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
What was that?

959
01:33:11.708 --> 01:33:13.416
Husband… and wife.
