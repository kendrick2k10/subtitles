Fucking stay still!

6
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.375
Hey! What are you doing? Let her go.

7
00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.416
-Fucking stay still!
-No!

8
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.125

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.750

13
00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:14.791
Are you okay?

14
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:16.875
-Yes.
-Yes?

15
00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:17.791
Yes.

16
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:19.458
Careful.

17
00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.000
Fuck.

18
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:31.166
I can treat you.

19
00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:33.958
Treat me?

20
00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:37.375
-Where? At your house?
-My employers'.

21
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.541
Sure? I don't want to cause trouble.

22
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.166
It's fine.

23
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:02.916
Sorry. I didn't mean to make noise.

24
00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:06.000
-Doesn't matter. Nobody's home.
-They're not here?

25
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.541
Away for the whole weekend.

26
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.333
Hey. I was thinking…

27
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.708
-What?
-Maybe you should report it.

28
00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.375
Then at least the police
would take a look.

29
00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.333
In case they come back.

30
00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:29.166
I can't.

31
00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:31.000
I…

32
00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:33.875
I don't want to lose this job.

33
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.750
And why would you?

34
00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:42.625
My employers are particular.
They don't want to draw attention.

35
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:43.916
Did you hear that?

36
00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:47.916
-What?
-A door.

37
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.833
Is anyone coming to work now?

38
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.291
There's a cook.
but she comes in the morning.

39
00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:57.291
Maybe they followed us.

40
00:04:58.458 --> 00:04:59.541
Shit.

41
00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:10.458
I'll take a look.

42
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.541
You stay here.

43
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.833
If you hear something odd.
call the cops. please.

44
00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.750
Yes.

45
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:09.333
Hey! Easy.

46
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:11.583
-Sorry.
-Easy.

47
00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.375
False alarm.
It was a window in the bathroom.

48
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:23.125
Are you okay?

49
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.708
Well. goodbye.

50
00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.916

Listen. Wendy. let me give you my number.

53

If you want.
I drive over there almost every day.

54
00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:45.416
So. I don't know. maybe…
I can give you a ride some other Saturday.

55
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.083
Of course.

I'm juggling 20 things
and you're stuck on this shit.

62
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.875
Why?

63
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:23.250
He's clean. He's been in the party since
he was 18. No problems.

64
00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:27.125
He's no trouble. draws no attention.
He may be on the next ballot to fill space

65
00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.875
but chances are he won't be elected.

66
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.875
Come on. Juan.
Someone must know something.

67
00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.875
They always do.

68
00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.125
A schoolmate who never liked you.

69
00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.500
The best friend whose life you ruined.

70
00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:42.291
There's always someone.
What can I tell you?

71
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:45.500
I've found nothing so far.
Doesn't drink. smoke. or see women.

72
00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:48.416
A bit of porn
every now and then. but that's it.

73
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.333
Normal porn?

74
00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:53.875
He's even boring with that. And his wife?

75
00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:57.791
Does she watch porn?

76
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.333
-How we doing?
-They came back home.

77
00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:08.708
The cameras are working fine.
but nothing yet.

78
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.708
Someone called.

79
00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:19.458
<i>Hey. Juan. I need to see you. It's urgent.</i>
<i>Tomorrow at eight. usual spot.</i>

80
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:33.833
Sportswear suits you.

81
00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:38.375
-Yeah? Does it turn you on?
-You know what turns me on.

82
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.375
You got anything good to tell me?

83
00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:44.625
I'm fucked. Juan.
Selling an ad page is crazy.

84
00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:47.041
And digital or not.
salaries need to be paid.

85
00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:50.041
-You're top of my list. you know that.
-Yes…

86
00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:53.291
The moment I have something good.
the scoop is yours. for now…

87
00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.083
"Let's clean the trash in this country."

88
00:09:56.166 --> 00:10:00.041
"Now with digital. there's no
company policy to cover up corruption."

89
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.958
"Come on. take the leap."

90
00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:04.541
Well. here I am.

91
00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:07.791
I took the leap. and I'm still in the air
waiting for you to decide

92
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:10.166
to give me something serious. good.

93
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.458
Have I ever given you
a tip that wasn't true?

94
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:14.916
You use me to screw
whoever at that moment.

95
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.375
So why are we talking?

96
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:19.875
I give you information.
you verify it. check it.

97
00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.125
If it's worth it. you go public.
If not. tell me to fuck off.

98
00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:24.416
Pretty clear. right?

99
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:27.166
I'm an idiot.

100
00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:30.458
I thought you meant it.

101
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:32.500
That you were sick of it all

102
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:35.958
and at some point you were going
to help me tell the truth.

103
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:38.375
-The truth?
-Yes. the truth. Juan.

104
00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:39.541
Do you remember?

105
00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:42.583
That's a lot. isn't it? "The truth."

106
00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:56.041
I can talk to someone
and get you some ads. Just to get by.

107
00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.333
In exchange for what?

108
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:00.416

-I want to meet with him.
-Galán?

146
00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:34.375
-To offer him your services?
-For whatever I want.

147
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:36.416

148
00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:39.041

152
00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:10.750

And I can't get her to come out.

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:17.458

156
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.208
I took it. but before I did.
she called the cops.

157
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:23.458
I called the boss.
I didn't know what to do.

158
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.958
But listen. I really didn't want to do it.

159
00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:28.625
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

160
00:15:28.708 --> 00:15:32.041
Wait in the living room.
Don't move. and don't let anyone in.

161
00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:34.166
-Okay?
-Yes. okay.

162
00:15:39.416 --> 00:15:40.250
Branka?

163
00:15:41.666 --> 00:15:43.458
Branka. my name is Rodrigo.

164
00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:44.750
I'm from the police.

165
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.583
You can come out.
Your husband won't hurt you.

166
00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:52.416

so we can help you.

169
00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:16.208
Yeah. he's here. Huh?

170
00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:19.916
Yeah. but I don't know
how the fuck he'll do it.

171
00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:22.500
I messed up her fucking face.

172
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.791
Shit. I messed up her face.

173
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:35.458
Branka. listen.

174
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:40.208
Now. in a moment.
we're going to leave and go to a hospital.

175
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.333
To have you examined
and get a medical report. Okay?

176
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.666
-I don't want to see him.
-You won't.

177
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.583
-That bastard ruined my life.
-Branka. that's not true.

178
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:54.791
-Look at me. for fuck's sake.
-I am.

179
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:58.625
I'm telling you. in a few months.
when you look in that mirror.

180
00:16:58.708 --> 00:17:00.458
you'll be the same person.

181
00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:03.541
It's just a matter of time.

182
00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:07.875
Nothing has happened yet
that can't be fixed.

183
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:09.708
"Yet"?

184
00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:13.666
"Yet"?

185
00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:18.041
He'll rot in jail after this.

186
00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:22.208
I want everyone to know
the kind of person that bastard really is.

187
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.708
And they will know it. Branka.

188
00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.458
In a few hours.
it'll be all over the news.

189
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:30.125
I'm not scared anymore.

190
00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:31.041
Good.

191
00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:33.250
Very good.

192
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.708
Listen…

193
00:17:35.791 --> 00:17:39.083
Is… there anything
that could be used against you?

194
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.416
Against me?

195
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.083
They must've been following you for months
in case they needed to pressure you.

196
00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.333
I've done nothing. I have nothing to hide.

197
00:17:49.416 --> 00:17:51.125
Someone close to you? Family?

198
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.458
What does my family
have to do with all this?

199
00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:56.541
We're talking about a team whose president

200
00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:59.458
is one of the most
influential businessmen in this country.

201
00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.875
And he's about to lose a lot of money.

202
00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958
My family doesn't live in Spain.
They're in Ukraine.

203
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:13.541
This is from six months ago.
On the right. is the president of Ukraine.

204
00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:16.208
The contract for the new subway line.

205
00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:18.750
the Ministry of Justice in Kiev--

206
00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:20.916
They're going to screw my family.

207
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.875
Motherfuckers!

208
00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:27.333
He can't just get away with it after this.

209
00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.625
There must be a way.

210
00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:35.583
There could be.

211
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.416
-So?
-She won't report it.

212
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.375
Yes! Fuck. yeah!

213
00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:54.000
Fucking awesome.
That's great. I'm gonna talk to her.

214
00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:55.583
No. you can't. Listen up.

215
00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:59.708
The police are waiting outside.
There are reporters too.

216
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.666
For fuck's sake. How did they find out?

217
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.750
I don't know.

218
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:05.791
They can't see her.

219
00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:08.583
But she has to go to the hospital.

220
00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:12.583
We'll come up with a story
everyone can believe.

221
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.500
-Perfect. a story.
-A burglary.

222
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.458
There have been several cases
of soccer players lately.

223
00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:22.333
But in this case.
it will be a violent burglary.

224
00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.416
After beating the owners up.
they open the safe and disappear.

225
00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:30.500
-That won't work.
-Why?

226
00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:32.291
Because I'm fine.

227
00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:58.625
Thank you.

228
00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:10.583
That's the buyer. We've located him.
His name is Günter Schull. German.

229
00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:13.625
He has links
with supremacist and Neo-Nazi groups.

230
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.083
Do we know what he's buying?

231
00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:21.500
We need access to that laptop.

232
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.666
Wendy!

233
00:20:31.166 --> 00:20:32.125
Hi. Álex.

234
00:20:32.208 --> 00:20:33.666
Alright? Want a ride?

235
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:36.750
No. the bus will be here any minute.

236
00:20:36.833 --> 00:20:39.500
Get in.
Give your friends something to talk about.

237
00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:06.958
So you're…

238
00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:08.416
-Six sisters.
-Six.

239
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.708
Seven. including me.

240
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.208
All girls and all working across Europe.

241
00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:14.125
Yes.

242
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.333
We're saving money
to build a house in the Philippines.

243
00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:21.000
A house? So all of you can live there?

244
00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:22.416
Live and work.

245
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.375
We have the land.

246
00:21:24.458 --> 00:21:28.333
We're going to build three storeys
with rooms for tourists.

247
00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:30.250
And with sea views.

248
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.125
What if you get married?

249
00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:37.250
You'll live with them?
Or you won't get married?

250
00:21:38.333 --> 00:21:40.875
No. Well. I don't know.

251
00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:43.166
Yeah. well. You're right.

252
00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:45.125
Why complicate things?

253
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.125
Fifteen minutes.

254
00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:01.166
So quick.

255
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:04.666
It's very late. I have to go back now.

256
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.083
I'll take you.

257
00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:09.791
There's no need. I'll take the bus.

258
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:12.708
No. really. I don't mind.
I'll feel more at ease.

259
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:14.208
Okay.

260
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:21.958
The other day. in the house.
I noticed something.

261
00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:24.375
What?

262
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.250
In your room.

263
00:23:30.708 --> 00:23:32.833
There was nothing of yours.
Nothing personal.

264
00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:36.583
It's not my room. I just live there.

265
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:39.041
That's why I don't have much.

266
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.875
It makes moving to another house easier.

267
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:48.375
Everything in a suitcase.

268
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.833
-There it is.
-What do you think?

269
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:38.583
Either those shoes are expensive.
or there's something behind.

270
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:53.083
You went a bit far.

271
00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:55.958
-You think?
-A couple of hits is fine. but this…

272
00:25:56.041 --> 00:25:59.583
He'll be out for at least three
or four games. The boss is fuming.

273
00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.833
Better than losing everything. right?

274
00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:07.166
You hate having to do this kind
of thing. right? You don't get it.

275
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.041
I get it. but I don't like it.

276
00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:11.500
-We have to take care of friends.
-Whose?

277
00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:15.375
-Today's favor…
-Is tomorrow's key. I know.

278
00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:19.833
And thanks to you. millions of Spaniards

279
00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:22.291
can still enjoy
the best soccer league in the world.

280
00:26:23.208 --> 00:26:24.583
You should be pleased.

281
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:26.708
So…

282
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:30.208
-Any news on our favorite politician?
-Not much.

283
00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:33.666
-Not much is something.
-He has a fake profile on social media.

284
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:37.416
-That sounds good.
-Don't get your hopes up.

285
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.791
I thought I'd found something
but there's nothing major.

286
00:26:40.875 --> 00:26:42.083
So why did he do it?

287
00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:44.791
To chat without anyone knowing
he's a politician.

288
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:45.708
About what?

289
00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:47.916
TV series.

290
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
music stuff. sharing videos…

291
00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:51.916
Of kittens?

292
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.958
Extreme sports. and people getting
weird tattoos. Things like that.

293
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:56.958
Seriously?

294
00:26:57.875 --> 00:27:00.000
-I don't buy it.
-Galán. there's nothing.

295
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:02.541
Just someone playing at being anonymous.

296
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.208
THE SHOES ARE MOVING.

297
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.708
Something's come up. Gotta go.

298
00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:09.750
Juan.

299
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:12.500
We all have a desire.

300
00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:15.250
Find his.

301
00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:18.375
Give it to him. and record it.

302
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:20.166
Easy as that.

303
00:27:21.416 --> 00:27:22.541
Easy as that?

304
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:24.208
Any problems?

305
00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:30.833
It's one thing to look for shit.
and another to throw it at him.

306
00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:34.791
If he's the saint you say he is.
it won't touch him. Right?

307
00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.166
Come on. Juan. Don't let me down.

308
00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:40.583
It'd be the first time.

309
00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:55.125
Hell yeah. we're in.

310
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:09.791
Not even a phone call
or a message in seven days.

311
00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:14.708
Be honest. if I hadn't shown up.
would you have bothered to call me?

312
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:15.625
No.

313
00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:17.041
I don't think so.

314
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:22.666
I prefer things to happen
when they're meant to.

315
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.833
They just left. Go.

316
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.041
OPEN FROM EXTERNAL DEVICE

317
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:09.958
RECENT ITEMS

318
00:29:14.541 --> 00:29:16.375

COPY ALL DATA

320
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:42.875
What?

321
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:45.250
Nothing.

322
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:50.000
Nothing?

323
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.208
This is weird. right?

324
00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:58.458
I don't know. look at you.

325
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.208
And look at me.

326
00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:02.583
We couldn't be more different.

327
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:05.166
Yes. And?

328
00:30:07.708 --> 00:30:08.541
Nothing.

329
00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:25.500
<i>Cobalt-60.</i>

330
00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:28.916
It's used in industry to measure
the thickness of metals and plastics.

331
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.541
And in medical facilities
to sterilize materials.

332
00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:32.791
And to make bombs.

333
00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:35.583
If you connect a conventional bomb
to a piece of Cobalt-60.

334
00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:38.791
even if it's 30cm.
you contaminate a whole city.

335
00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:41.666
It's from an abandoned
military hospital in Argentina.

336
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.250
Generals are making big money
selling it on the black market.

337
00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:49.333
Neo-Nazi terrorists buying a dirty bomb.

338
00:30:49.416 --> 00:30:51.666
They may hand it over here or in Germany.

339
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.791
We should warn them.
and pass this intel to the BND.

340
00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:56.916
They'll smuggle it through Spain.

341
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.791
-Why?
-There's an email account.

342
00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:01.541
It was deleted after sending it.
but they're in touch

343
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:04.208
with a network
that's been smuggling coke into Europe

344
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:07.041
from several countries.
including Argentina. for a year.

345
00:31:07.125 --> 00:31:09.875
I think they'll be using
one of their routes.

346
00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:13.041
We need to find out
where they'll smuggle the goods.

347
00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:16.083
Check if we know someone
who works with them too.

348
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.041
László Kurucz?

349
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:18.875
Maybe. Check it out.

350
00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:22.833
I need you to set something up for me.

351
00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:25.583

This isn't enough.

354
00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:36.333
For it to work.
I need to invent at least six months back.

355
00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:38.750

00:33:54.541 --> 00:33:57.458
…or you guys call it. Calimocho.

376
00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:00.833
I tried this mix at <i>los Sanfermines.</i>
Ever been there?

377
00:34:00.916 --> 00:34:01.875
Never.

378
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:07.291
<i>Los Sanfermines. la Semana Grande.</i>
Carnival of Tenerife…

379
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:11.166
You guys in Spain
really know how to party.

380
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.708
Is that why

381
00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:15.500
you like to do business over there?

382
00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:18.875
I like to do business
whatever the treatment.

383
00:34:18.958 --> 00:34:21.541
-It's a mutual respect. you know. man.
-Well…

384
00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:25.750
Last time you went over.
things weren't that smooth. right?

385
00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:30.041
I've heard you had a little problem
with the Guardia Civil.

386
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:33.833
They confiscated 50 kilos
of coke from you. right?

387
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:37.375
It's the nature of our business.

388
00:34:38.291 --> 00:34:42.541
But you just came here
all over to give me this bullshit?

389
00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:43.458
No.

390
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:48.916
I'm here to give you back
what belongs to you.

391
00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:50.875
The 50 kilos.

392
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.625
You mean the police.
or how you guys call them. the "picoletos"

393
00:34:57.125 --> 00:35:00.041
are just going to give me back
my precious cocaine

394
00:35:00.125 --> 00:35:02.583
with some note saying. "We are sorry"?

395
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.791
Not exactly. I'll get it for you.

396
00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:11.083
I have some friends there.
and I know where they burn it.

397
00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:15.333
I'll get the stuff
and drop it off wherever you want.

398
00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:17.875
In a one by one exchange
for your information.

399
00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:18.791
Yeah.

400
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:24.500
This info you're after
must be really important for you. huh?

401
00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:30.625
Do you know these guys?

402
00:35:41.125 --> 00:35:43.583
-Yes?
-We know where they'll smuggle the goods.

403
00:35:43.666 --> 00:35:45.833
<i>-It'll be through Bilbao's harbor.</i>
-Great.

404
00:35:45.916 --> 00:35:48.375
Hey. I'll call you back.
I'm with my mom. okay?

405
00:35:48.458 --> 00:35:50.000
<i>-Okay. bye.</i>
-See you later.

406
00:36:16.916 --> 00:36:17.958
Marta!

407
00:36:19.666 --> 00:36:20.500
Hey!

408
00:36:20.583 --> 00:36:22.083
-How are you?
-Good.

409
00:36:22.666 --> 00:36:25.375
-You?
-Good. So you come here now?

410
00:36:25.458 --> 00:36:26.541
No. I work here.

411
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.333
-Any problems?
-No. none.

412
00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:31.666
-No? Okay.
-Or is there?

413
00:36:32.541 --> 00:36:36.875
No. Rent. books. university.
they don't pay for themselves. you know?

414
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.208
Your dad doesn't help you?

415
00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:42.791
I don't give a shit about my father.
I get by on my own.

416
00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:43.708
I see that.

417
00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:47.166
This is a job like any other.

418
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.958
People love to spend money and
we help them. Anything wrong with that?

419
00:36:51.041 --> 00:36:54.791
Not until one of them wants more
than just a drink with you.

420
00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:55.750
There's security.

421
00:36:56.458 --> 00:36:57.291
Don't worry.

422
00:36:57.375 --> 00:37:00.583
And besides. look.
That guy with the tie on his head…

423
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.083
District council member.

424
00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:04.500
Yep.

425
00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:10.250
Why do I bother if you know
half these people better than I do?

426
00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:13.333
-That's why I'm saying to be careful.
-Thank you.

427
00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:31.708
It'll be easy.

428
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:34.958
The camera will be out.
and the patrol watching the site

429
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:37.625
will be making a long round
on the opposite side.

430
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:38.875
You're the fucking man!

431
00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:42.500
Fifty kilos need to be delivered
to La Jonquera. okay?

432
00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:44.541
There's the address. The rest is for you.

433
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:45.458
Great.

434
00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:49.916
You're the fucking man. Juan.
Stay and have a drink with the boys.

435
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.958
-Another time. Goyito.
-Come on. stay.

436
00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:52.875
Okay.

I prefer to come in

00:38:57.833 --> 00:39:00.583
I should've told you I'd be away for work.

443
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.416
No need.

444
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:05.208
But I want to.

445
00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:08.250
I'm not used to depending on anyone.

<i>Okay. copy.</i>

474
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.791
He just left the cab. okay?
He's leaving early.

475
00:41:49.875 --> 00:41:51.000
Come on. let's go.

476
00:41:57.416 --> 00:41:58.541
<i>He's on the esplanade.</i>

477
00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:01.208
He's headed for the parking lot. Go.

478
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:06.916
<i>Come on. you can start assembling now. Go.</i>

479
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.500
It's not here. Fuck!

480
00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:22.583
I'm going to lose sight of him.
He'll show up any minute. Go.

481
00:42:22.666 --> 00:42:23.625
Let's go!

482
00:42:27.416 --> 00:42:29.166
<i>Get out of there!</i>

483
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.666
-What the hell happened?
-Maybe he left it in his locker.

484
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.916
They searched it. there's nothing
there or in the cabin of the crane.

485
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.375
He didn't see anyone today?

486
00:43:04.458 --> 00:43:07.125
-Maybe the intel wasn't good.
-No. impossible.

487
00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:11.291
No. László wouldn't lie
about the Germans getting a sample today.

488
00:43:11.375 --> 00:43:14.500
-It isn't worth it to fuck with us.
-Or they changed their minds.

489
00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:18.416
Let's go over it from the start.

490
00:43:18.916 --> 00:43:20.000
We can do that.

491
00:43:20.916 --> 00:43:24.750
But no one has come close to the car
or seen him since he arrived

492
00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:26.125
until he left just now.

493
00:43:26.208 --> 00:43:27.125
Maybe there.

494
00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:28.375
Where?

495
00:43:28.458 --> 00:43:29.791
In the security gatehouse.

496
00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:32.500
We have his entry and exit on tape. right?

497
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
We do. yeah. but…

498
00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:35.916
Let's see.

499
00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:42.875
Okay. stop.

500
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.250
Zoom in. Play.

501
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:48.708
Slowly.

502
00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.291
Stop!

503
00:43:52.375 --> 00:43:53.250
There.

504
00:43:53.333 --> 00:43:54.166
What's that?

505
00:43:54.875 --> 00:43:56.041
Car keys.

506
00:43:56.666 --> 00:43:58.083
Son of a bitch.

507
00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:42.875
It's him. It's Günter Schull.

508
00:44:42.958 --> 00:44:45.666
The other one
is likely testing the sample.

509
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.541
If everything's fine. they'll call again
for the delivery.

510
00:44:50.958 --> 00:44:52.083
Intel was good.

511
00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:55.625
We now know how they're moving it.

512
00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:18.291
Shit!

513
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:22.791
Shit. come on. Pick up.

514
00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:40.083
Are you going to nag me
about the nightclub?

515
00:45:40.166 --> 00:45:42.166
-No. I'm not here to nag you.
-No?

516
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.958
I need to ask you a favor.

517
00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:46.291
-Yes?
<i>-Are you with Juan?</i>

518
00:45:46.375 --> 00:45:48.583
-I don't know where he is.
-He won't pick up.

519
00:45:48.666 --> 00:45:50.666
-What's wrong?
<i>-We've fucked up.</i>

520
00:45:51.833 --> 00:45:53.500
The Filipina found a camera.

521
00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:58.000
Are you out of your fucking mind
or what? I'm not a whore.

522
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.166
If I thought a whore could do it.
I'd be asking one. but I need you.

523
00:46:03.833 --> 00:46:04.833
Why?

524
00:46:04.916 --> 00:46:07.041
You're exactly who he wants to meet.

525
00:46:07.625 --> 00:46:09.791
You just have to change your look.

526
00:46:12.333 --> 00:46:13.583
Go to hell.

527
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.333
Marta.

528
00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:20.958
Marta! Listen to me.

529
00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:23.083
-Marta!
-I was sick.

530
00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:26.875
I was sick.
I was 15. and I was totally hooked.

531
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:29.833
-I helped you leave.
-You promised no one would see the video.

532
00:46:29.916 --> 00:46:31.125
And no one ever has.

533
00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:32.958
You still have it?

534
00:46:33.041 --> 00:46:35.541
They wanted to sell it to a magazine
and I stopped it.

535
00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:38.750
You kept it so you can screw me
whenever you want.

536
00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:39.708
Marta. listen.

537
00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:42.500
-It's blackmail.
-I'm asking a favor.

538
00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:43.958
Like hell you are!

539
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:47.791
If I don't go on a date.
you'll leak it and let everyone see

540
00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:50.041
the daughter
of the most famous actor on TV

541
00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:52.458
blowing a drug dealer
for some fucking smack!

542
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:53.583
That won't happen.

543
00:46:54.666 --> 00:46:56.000
It doesn't need to happen.

544
00:47:07.666 --> 00:47:10.666
-What's she saying?
-There are no bugs there or in her room.

545
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.333
-She didn't go to the garden.
-How is that relevant?

546
00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:16.500
She could've gone to tell them
what she found.

547
00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:19.208
Just because she hasn't yet
doesn't mean she won't.

548
00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:20.500
We have to get her out.

549
00:47:20.583 --> 00:47:23.083
If she disappears.
they could get suspicious.

550
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.791
We don't want changes in the house.

551
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:28.583
Whether we want it or not.
there's a change. She knows.

552
00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:05.000
Wendy.

553
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:08.041
Are you leaving?

554
00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:10.125
Can I tell you something?

555
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.666
-Wendy. listen.
-Álex. leave me alone. please.

556
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.125
I wish I could explain. I can't.

557
00:48:17.708 --> 00:48:20.625
-I don't need an explanation.
-You need to stay.

558
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:23.625
I'm doing something important.
you have to trust me.

559
00:48:23.708 --> 00:48:24.541
Trust?

560
00:48:25.666 --> 00:48:28.708
-I know I can't ask you that. it's hard.
-Why did you come back?

561
00:48:29.916 --> 00:48:32.833
The first time. you tricked me
to get in here. After that. why?

562
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.916
I wanted to be with you.

563
00:48:37.083 --> 00:48:40.833
-You said you didn't want to hurt me.
-That's the last thing I'd want.

564
00:48:40.916 --> 00:48:43.458
-What's between us is real.
-Is that true?

565
00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:48.833
Wendy. I understand
you don't want to see me ever again.

566
00:48:48.916 --> 00:48:51.708
you feel betrayed.
but please listen to me.

567
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.250
You're leaving without telling them
because you know they're bad news too.

568
00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:05.500
You want to disappear and avoid trouble.
but they won't let anyone

569
00:49:05.583 --> 00:49:07.666
jeopardize what they're working on.

570
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.208
I assure you. Wendy. they will find you.

571
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.458
They'll get you out of the way.

572
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:17.041
You and anyone who stands in their way.
You know that's true.

573
00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:26.875
She won't say anything.

574
00:49:26.958 --> 00:49:29.541
-Why should we believe her?
-Because she won't. dammit.

575
00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:33.208
If I wasn't sure.
she'd be in that trunk now.

576
00:49:33.291 --> 00:49:34.500
Are we clear or not?

577
00:49:35.958 --> 00:49:36.958
Yes. we're clear.

578
00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:38.541
So quit busting my balls.

579
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.833
Where is he?

580
00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:03.666
There.

581
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.041
SERGIO_93
ARE YOU UPSTAIRS?

582
00:50:21.166 --> 00:50:22.625
SARA
YES. I DON'T SEE YOU

583
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.208
THERE'S A PRIVATE AREA. SEE IT?

584
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.750
SERIOUSLY? VIP AREA: 0

585
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:36.958
COME

586
00:50:57.708 --> 00:50:58.541
Hi.

587
00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:16.166
RED LEATHER TOP?

588
00:51:17.416 --> 00:51:21.666
GETTING WARMER…

589
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.583
I think you have something to tell me.

590
00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:35.875
I think you have
something to tell me too. right?

591
00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:37.291
Hi. Sara.

592
00:51:38.125 --> 00:51:38.958
Sergio.

593
00:51:57.083 --> 00:51:58.625
So? How'd it go?

594
00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:04.125
Fine. Well. I don't know. I was a bit mean
at first. because of the photo thing.

595
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:07.083
He said I'd done the same thing.
so we laughed.

596
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.291
And. from there. we went to his room.

597
00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:15.208
He pushed me against the closet
and started to fuck me.

598
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:18.125
Can you believe it?
He didn't seem the type. but…

599
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.333
What?

600
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:25.208
Sorry. but you wanted me
to get him in my pocket. right?

601
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.750
Will you tell me what happened?

602
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:29.583
You know what?

603
00:52:29.666 --> 00:52:33.083
You could've put a bug on me
and you'd already know everything.

604
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:34.291
Well. I could have.

605
00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:38.208
And you didn't because. deep down.

606
00:52:38.291 --> 00:52:42.041
you weren't so sure I wouldn't end up
naked in a room with him.

607
00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:43.416
Admit it.

608
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:46.666
Not on the first date. He's not the type.

609
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:48.750
Oh. right.

610
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:49.708
So?

611
00:52:50.833 --> 00:52:52.833
I told him what you told me to.

612
00:52:52.916 --> 00:52:56.333
That I don't trust anyone because I had
to get rid of a couple of guys

613
00:52:56.416 --> 00:52:59.416
it didn't end well with.
so that's why I have a fake profile.

614
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500
And him?

615
00:53:00.583 --> 00:53:02.791
He said his photos are fake.
but not the rest.

616
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:06.291
He said he's a lawyer
and he has to keep up appearances.

617
00:53:06.375 --> 00:53:09.041
A lawyer. Well. it's true he studied law.

618
00:53:09.125 --> 00:53:13.250
And so I said it's fine.
that I'm not angry.

619
00:53:13.833 --> 00:53:16.166
but that it's not what I'm looking for.

620
00:53:17.083 --> 00:53:19.291
-But that we can be friends.
-Keep chatting…

621
00:53:19.375 --> 00:53:21.083
Yeah. and getting to know each other.

622
00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:22.708
Good.

623
00:53:23.458 --> 00:53:24.583
I don't know…

624
00:53:24.666 --> 00:53:25.500
What?

625
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:29.625
He was a bit nervous.

626
00:53:30.333 --> 00:53:32.541
I think it's the first time
he's done this.

627
00:53:34.083 --> 00:53:35.291
He may disappear.

628
00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:38.375
Well. we'll find out soon.

629
00:54:22.708 --> 00:54:25.000
-Yes?
<i>-The goods are on their way.</i>

630
00:54:25.875 --> 00:54:26.708
What?

631
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:29.958
<i>The woman just told Schull</i>
<i>the cobalt has left Argentina.</i>

632
00:54:30.041 --> 00:54:33.083
<i>It arrives in Bilbao in a few days.</i>
<i>We just need the ship's name.</i>

633
00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:35.708
They can't catch us off guard.
Chema can't miss anything.

634
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:38.375
I need people listening 24/7. Everything.

635
00:54:42.083 --> 00:54:43.291
<i>I can't leave Spain now.</i>

636
00:54:43.375 --> 00:54:46.125
This is a big one.
Otherwise. I wouldn't turn to you.

637
00:54:46.208 --> 00:54:47.666
I know you're flat out.

638
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.875
I'm not dropping an operation for this.

639
00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:52.958
We're talking two days. Three tops.

640
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.875
Okay. look. I'll tell you what.

641
00:54:57.583 --> 00:55:00.708
You do me this favor.
and I get the politician out of your hair.

642
00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:06.041
-Isn't that what you wanted?
-I've given him bait. I'm waiting.

643
00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:08.583
-Well. we can pass it to Azcona.
-Azcona?

644
00:55:09.083 --> 00:55:11.416
-He's with us now?
-I know you don't like him.

645
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:15.208
but he's keen.
and at least he's not as picky as you are.

646
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:16.666
So send him to Panama.

647
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.125
No. he's too green.

648
00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:23.458
Besides. they want you. And so do I.
I don't trust anyone else for this.

649
00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:25.458
Two days?

650
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.166
Three at the most.

651
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.833
But I stay with Ángel González.
It's not a good idea to change now.

652
00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:33.250
Awesome. Your call.

653
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.416
Do we know what the Panamanians want?
I can't go empty-handed.

654
00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:41.250
Don't worry. you won't go empty-handed.

655
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.375
PANAMA CITY

656
00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:02.625
Naranjo?

657
00:56:03.166 --> 00:56:04.041
Shit!

658
00:56:04.708 --> 00:56:05.708
How are you. bro?

659
00:56:06.333 --> 00:56:08.958
Whatever happened to my Madrid friend?

660
00:56:09.041 --> 00:56:11.166
Who'd recognize you. man? Sit down.

661
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.583
-Come on. sit.
-You're the same as always.

662
00:56:15.291 --> 00:56:18.583
That's the upside of being ugly
from a young age. It can't get worse.

663
00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:21.375
Delia.

664
00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:24.833
-Another one. please. You want anything?
-The same as him.

665
00:56:25.666 --> 00:56:28.333
How long ago did you come back
from Madrid? Five years?

666
00:56:28.416 --> 00:56:29.583
Time flies.

667
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.708
-I miss the nights in Madrid.
-The Madrid style of life.

668
00:56:34.625 --> 00:56:36.708
So. what shall we do with this guy?

669
00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:41.041
-Well. we'll have to sort something out.
-Good.

670
00:56:41.916 --> 00:56:43.333
We have him held in his room.

671
00:56:43.916 --> 00:56:47.625
Two days have passed.
and it hasn't gone public yet.

672
00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:49.083
We appreciate that.

673
00:56:50.875 --> 00:56:51.708
Look.

674
00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:55.250
This is the guy.

675
00:56:56.291 --> 00:56:59.375
A guy who ran marijuana. Small-time.

676
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:01.541
Apparently. they met in a bar.

677
00:57:01.625 --> 00:57:04.291
They had a couple of drinks
and went to the hotel.

678
00:57:08.208 --> 00:57:12.291
Is it true that your friend
decides the life and freedom of people?

679
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.166
-He has a good reputation.
-Fuck.

680
00:57:16.958 --> 00:57:20.125
Well. if that's how they make decisions
in the Supreme Court.

681
00:57:20.208 --> 00:57:21.916
I pity you poor Spaniards.

682
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:28.166
Thank you.

683
00:57:29.083 --> 00:57:29.916
Look.

684
00:57:31.416 --> 00:57:35.125
The family doesn't know the details.
They know the kid is dead.

685
00:57:35.208 --> 00:57:37.666
He had epileptic seizures from childhood.

686
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:40.458
and they were told
that was the cause of his death.

687
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.625
He had a seizure and fell off a balcony.

688
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:47.583
Now. if you want our help.
you'll have to compensate the family.

689
00:57:48.083 --> 00:57:49.125
Them. and us.

690
00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:56.083
Compensation for everyone.

691
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:06.833
Money.

692
00:58:08.041 --> 00:58:10.041
Don't fuck with me. man.

693
00:58:10.833 --> 00:58:13.791
That's alright for the family. But for us?

694
00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:16.708
Do you really think we need your money?

695
00:58:24.625 --> 00:58:25.750
Here you go.

696
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:30.541
An important banker of this country
having fun with a gigolo in Chueca.

697
00:58:31.625 --> 00:58:32.916
Enough compensation?

698
00:58:52.958 --> 00:58:54.666
-Take care.
-Have a nice trip.

699
00:58:56.416 --> 00:58:58.750
And stay out of trouble. sir.

700
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.583
Thank you.

701
00:59:11.625 --> 00:59:13.916
-When we get to Madrid--
-No one knows anything.

702
00:59:16.583 --> 00:59:19.291
-My wife must've been told--
-A visa issue.

703
00:59:19.875 --> 00:59:22.791
-A diplomatic incident.
-A diplomatic incident.

704
00:59:23.958 --> 00:59:25.875
A setup. that's what it was.

705
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:32.083
As soon as I finished my conference.
they took me to the airport.

706
00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:34.416
The plane malfunctions. I stay the night--

707
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.041
You don't need to explain.

708
00:59:37.083 --> 00:59:40.416
-I didn't pay for a boy's services.
-He was in your room.

709
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.500
He was a fucking dealer! Can't you see?

710
00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:47.041
The canceled flight. the guy in the bar.
he comes to my room. does lines…

711
00:59:52.333 --> 00:59:53.375
Hang on a minute.

712
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.833
What?

713
00:59:55.958 --> 00:59:57.083
Was this you?

714
00:59:59.333 --> 01:00:01.291
You guys from the Agency staged all this?

715
01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:03.500
It's that shit. right?

716
01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.458
What do you call it?
"Robes control." right?

717
01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:09.458
You screw me. then come to the rescue.

718
01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.750
You wanted me on a leash.
like Remesana and Escudero.

719
01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:14.583
but since you couldn't find anything…

720
01:00:18.541 --> 01:00:20.791
You've been after me for six months.
But not this.

721
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:22.958
As soon as I get to Madrid.
I'll investigate

722
01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:26.041
what the association that paid
for me to come here really is.

723
01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:29.000
If I find out
you people are involved in this…

724
01:00:31.208 --> 01:00:35.250
The guy has an epileptic seizure.
and His Grace. who thinks he's dying.

725
01:00:35.333 --> 01:00:39.208
doesn't want him found in his room.
so throws him off the balcony.

726
01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:42.666
Who the fuck could stage that.
you cowardly piece of shit?

727
01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:09.291
We have to go now.
The goods have arrived at the harbor.

728
01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.625
-When?
-Today.

729
01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:11.583
Let's go.

730
01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:16.708
The building is
under the control of local dealers.

731
01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:19.750
The goods are inside.
waiting to be handed to Schull's people.

732
01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:24.000
-Do we know when the delivery is?
-Today. tomorrow… don't know.

733
01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:27.375
-If we set up a coordinated operation--
-We can't wait.

734
01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:30.791
Those houses are like Swiss cheese.
They're connected to each other.

735
01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:34.333
Before we get in. they can take it out
through 50 backyards. halls…

736
01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:36.500
No. if it's there. we have to get in now.

737
01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:39.375
It'll be very hard to get in
without attracting attention.

738
01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:42.000
Letting that get out of there
is not an option.

739
01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:51.916
Hi. guys. you want
some coke. ecstasy. pills?

740
01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:53.583
Speed? Nothing?

741
01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:03.125
Hi there. do you want some coke.
MDMA. speed…?

742
01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:05.541
-A bit of speed.
-Speed? Yes. follow me.

743
01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:28.250
It's here. Go to the third floor.

744
01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:05.083
What do you want?

745
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.875
We wanted a bit of speed.

746
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.333
Okay. come in.

747
01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:17.791
Come on.

748
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.625
Ana. they spotted him!

749
01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:28.833
<i>Go down the hall. turn left.</i>

750
01:07:28.916 --> 01:07:31.375
<i>Into the kitchen.</i>
<i>There's a hole. get inside.</i>

751
01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:39.375
Come on. Ana.

752
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.750
Agent 80-32 here. We need backup.

753
01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.708
Freeze! Let go of him!

754
01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:43.625
Now!

755
01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:46.375
Are you okay?

756
01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:51.458
Police!

757
01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:52.541
On the ground!

758
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:53.875
On the ground!

759
01:08:53.958 --> 01:08:54.958
Police! Stop!

760
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:56.625
Don't move! Freeze!

761
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.958
SERGIO_93 LIKES YOUR PHOTO

762
01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:16.583
SARA
HEY!

763
01:09:22.416 --> 01:09:23.583
THE GHOST

764
01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:34.000
LOT OF WORK

765
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:40.166
YOU HAVEN'T SENT ME 1 SINGLE LIKE IN AGES

766
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.333
Hey. I mean…

767
01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:44.541
No. I'm sick
of the individualistic discourse…

768
01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:49.791
DO YOU NOT LIKE ME ANYMORE?

769
01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:54.250
NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TOO ACTIVE YOURSELF.

770
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:56.041
TRYING TO GET BY. WORK IS AWFUL.

771
01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:06.500
IF YOU NEED A PHILOLOGIST
WITH EXPERIENCE IN BARS…

772
01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:08.500
HAVING DRINKS?

773
01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:14.041
HAHAHAHA. NO. STUPID! AS A WAITRESS!!

774
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.333
BUT IF YOU BUY ME A DRINK…

775
01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:27.666
CONSIDER IT DONE

776
01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:32.791
WHEN?

777
01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.041
AS SOON AS I HAVE TIME

778
01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:45.583
FRIDAY?

779
01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.625
AWAY. WORK TRIP.

780
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.375
TALK TO YOU LATER X

781
01:11:00.166 --> 01:11:01.041
Wendy!

782
01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:04.750
Can we talk for a moment?

783
01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:12.750
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. Don't go back to the house.

784
01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:16.583
There's police there. they may think
you have something to do with them.

785
01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:19.541
Is it over?

786
01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:20.458
Yes.

787
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.875
They're not a danger to you or anyone now.

788
01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:27.000
Thanks for telling me.

789
01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:33.458
Do you have a place to stay?

790
01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.291
I'll ring a friend.

791
01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:41.000
Wendy…

792
01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:47.541
I guess it's the last thing you want.
but you can stay at mine.

793
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.500
Until you find something.

794
01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:04.000
You can sleep in my bed. or there.
on the sofa-bed. Your choice.

795
01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.875
Here is fine. Thank you.

796
01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:12.541
You don't have many things.

797
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.166
No.

798
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.250
Everything in a suitcase.

799
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.583
Like you.

800
01:12:22.416 --> 01:12:23.750
It's easier like that. right?

801
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:26.541
Open the door and disappear.

802
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.416
If only that was enough.

803
01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:34.583
But it's hard not to leave a trail.

804
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.333
I'm sure you know how.

805
01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:43.333
I could try.

806
01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:48.166
We could try together.

807
01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.125
I mean it.

808
01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:56.625
I know a place where we wouldn't be found.

809
01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:01.375
<i>Good evening.</i>

810
01:13:01.458 --> 01:13:05.541
Top Sports magazine is all dressed up
for one of the big events of the year…

811
01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:09.166
A major event not only for sports.
but for representatives of culture.

812
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:11.875
politics and business in this country.

813
01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:14.166
The red carpet is full of public figures…

814
01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:26.500
How are you. Fernando?

815
01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.250
Smile. Fernando.

816
01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:37.333
We'll be there…

817
01:13:38.416 --> 01:13:41.541
-I have to go. Have fun. And best of luck.
-Thank you.

818
01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:45.791
Your Honor.

819
01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:47.666
Hey. Ángel!

820
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:50.125
You're here?
They invite you to these parties now?

821
01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:52.416
Well. it's the culture
and sports commission…

822
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.125
-So you're obliged?
-Pretty much.

823
01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:57.625
Hey. let me introduce you
to my wife. Alicia. Ángel González.

824
01:13:57.708 --> 01:14:00.541
-Pleasure.
-Dedicated student and now congressman.

825
01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:01.791
Dedicated student?

826
01:14:01.875 --> 01:14:04.958
Lousy exams. but very good essays.
That's something.

827
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.000
-Yes.
-And your wife?

828
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.708
No. she couldn't make it.
Our kid's sick. so…

829
01:14:09.791 --> 01:14:10.625
Right.

830
01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:16.125
Thank you.

831
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:23.000
Excuse me one second.

832
01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:03.916
The lawyer part was true.

833
01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:05.250
Well.

834
01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:07.416
I got my degree.

835
01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:12.625
Sara.

836
01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:15.625
listen to me.

837
01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:16.541
Who are you?

838
01:15:18.708 --> 01:15:19.791
I want to know you.

839
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:22.625
Sure.

840
01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:27.708
I know I'm not doing it right. but…

841
01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:33.791
I can't just go around telling people
I'm a politician and I work in Congress.

842
01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:35.708
Why didn't you say you were married?

843
01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:41.125
I don't know.

844
01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:46.000
I guess I didn't want
to complicate things… more.

845
01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:50.625
I'm sorry.

846
01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:53.208
Wait.

847
01:16:00.291 --> 01:16:01.375
I'm not angry.

848
01:16:03.875 --> 01:16:04.708
Really?

849
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.166
I understand.

850
01:16:12.958 --> 01:16:14.208
We all have secrets.

851
01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:17.708
And I don't like to be judged.
so I don't judge.

852
01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:30.958
-I have to go back in.
-Yeah. me too.

853
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.208
But if you want… I mean…

854
01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:38.500
for us to meet up again. then…

855
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.458
I don't know. if you want.

856
01:16:42.375 --> 01:16:44.750
-I'm going to Madrid after this.
-I'm not.

857
01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:46.666
No?

858
01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:48.541
I have a room.

859
01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.875
Here. I mean… in…

860
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:53.083
Oh. yeah?

861
01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:54.875
Yes. I have a hotel.

862
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.083
No. don't worry.
I just came back from the gala.

863
01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:10.666
No. I'll get up early tomorrow and arrive
in plenty of time for Nacho's game.

864
01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:14.250
Yes. One second.

865
01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:15.166
Hey!

866
01:18:15.666 --> 01:18:17.166
I'll call you back. Wait.

867
01:18:57.916 --> 01:18:59.375
Police. Can I come in?

868
01:19:02.666 --> 01:19:03.791
Come in.

869
01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:04.750
<i>Yes. I'm with him.</i>

870
01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:10.833
Yeah. of course. Sure. talk to you later.

871
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:16.750
The girl stands by what she said.
She wants to file charges.

872
01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:19.833
What charges?
She came here of her own free will.

873
01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:22.750
Well. she says you forced her.

874
01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:26.708
That she tried to push you off.
but couldn't until it was over.

875
01:19:26.791 --> 01:19:29.916
That's a lie. for God's sake.
I didn't do anything.

876
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.875
-But you admit having sex with her.
-Yes. we had sex by mutual consent.

877
01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:35.458
-By mutual consent?
-Yes.

878
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:38.333
Yet she's on her way
to the hospital now with a colleague?

879
01:19:38.416 --> 01:19:40.375
Okay. no. listen to me.

880
01:19:40.458 --> 01:19:43.583
She was perfectly fine when she went
in the bathroom.

881
01:19:43.666 --> 01:19:47.916
She suddenly came out bleeding.
and went straight for the door. That's it.

882
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.208
<i>-Did you do drugs?</i>
<i>-No. of course not.</i>

883
01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:33.958
<i>There's cocaine in the bathroom.</i>

884
01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:42.958
It doesn't… It can't be.

885
01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:47.208
I have absolutely nothing
to do with that. I swear.

886
01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:51.750
You say you previously had sex.
so when she's examined in the hospital and

887
01:20:51.833 --> 01:20:53.833
-they take a sample--
-We did.

888
01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.791
That's it. I swear.
I didn't do anything she didn't want.

889
01:20:58.208 --> 01:20:59.041
<i>With a minor?</i>

890
01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:03.250
<i>A minor? No. she's not a minor.</i>

891
01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:05.166
<i>No. she's 19 years old.</i>

892
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:06.708
She told me she was 19.

893
01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:08.041
Is that her purse?

894
01:21:08.541 --> 01:21:09.375
Yes.

895
01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:11.458
I guess so.

896
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:22.083
Listen.

897
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:24.125
Listen to me.

898
01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:27.375
I give you my word.
she told me she was of legal age.

899
01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:30.458
<i>-And she looked of legal age.</i>
<i>-Looked it…</i>

900
01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:31.375
Son of a bitch.

901
01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:32.291
<i>…but isn't.</i>

902
01:21:33.416 --> 01:21:34.916
At least not for six months.

903
01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:40.708
No.

904
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.458
-No. I can show you--
-I don't think so.

905
01:21:44.541 --> 01:21:47.583
I can. I have her messages here.
where she said she was 19.

906
01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:51.000
-There it is. Please look at it.
-That's not her name.

907
01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:51.916
But it's her.

908
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.125
-It's a fake profile. but it's her.
-Calm down.

909
01:21:54.208 --> 01:21:55.791
If you look. you'll see it's her.

910
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:59.916
Who's this "Sergio_93"?

911
01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:01.791
It's me.

912
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.625
I made a fake profile too. as…
a precaution. do you understand?

913
01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:08.875
I don't understand.
Please identify yourself--

914
01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:11.000
<i>-No. listen to me--</i>
<i>-You listen to me.</i>

915
01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:12.833
<i>I'm asking you to identify yourself.</i>

916
01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:16.166
<i>If you won't. we'll go to the station</i>
<i>and continue from there.</i>

917
01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:27.708
Are you…?

918
01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:31.625
Are you Ángel González. the congressman?

919
01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:35.125
Yes.

920
01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:38.083
Hence the fake profile?

921
01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:39.875
I…

922
01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:42.208
I wanted to avoid…

923
01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:46.250
It doesn't matter anymore.

924
01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:52.208
Ángel.

925
01:22:53.291 --> 01:22:54.625
Ángel. tell me the truth.

926
01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:57.458
I won't say anything
until I have a lawyer here. sorry.

927
01:22:57.541 --> 01:23:00.000
Listen. Do you think you've been set up?

928
01:23:01.791 --> 01:23:05.958
Of course I have.
A girl like her. out of nowhere…

929
01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:10.958
<i>I've been such an idiot. A moron…</i>

930
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.791
<i>-Who do you think could've set you up?</i>
<i>-I don't know!</i>

931
01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:16.875
-I don't know.
-Someone from the party?

932
01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.958
No. I don't think so.

933
01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:23.083
Think carefully. Ángel. It usually comes
from those closest to you.

934
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.791
-I don't have enemies.
-You clearly do.

935
01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:29.541
No one goes to these lengths for nothing.

936
01:23:29.625 --> 01:23:32.833
There must be a reason.
You pose a danger to someone.

937
01:23:32.916 --> 01:23:34.208
-Or a threat.
-No.

938
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:39.541
I doubt I'll get on the ballot this year.
Who would want me out of their way?

939
01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:42.958
-Maybe because of what you know.
-What I know?

940
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.125
Some sort of
sensitive information about someone

941
01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:49.208
that you may have come across
and that they want to iron out.

942
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:51.291
What information?

943
01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:54.625
Someone delivering an envelope to someone.

944
01:23:54.708 --> 01:23:57.000
a meeting with a judge
that shouldn't happen.

945
01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.416
-You know.
-No. I don't.

946
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.791
-No. there's nothing.
-Concentrate. please. There must be.

947
01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:05.541
Maybe something someone let slip
after a meeting. on a cigarette break.

948
01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:06.791
-Or at a party.
-No.

949
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:11.208
Something that could endanger someone's
reputation. Think carefully and don't lie!

950
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:14.000
If you want me to help you.
you must work with me.

951
01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:17.583
-We have to get to the bottom of this.
-I'm telling the truth!

952
01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:20.416
-There has to be something!
-I'm telling the truth. dammit.

953
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.250
I'm telling you the truth.

954
01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:26.625
I don't have any information on anything
or anyone. I don't have anything!

955
01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:28.208
I don't have…

956
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:31.125
Believe me. please. Believe me.

957
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:34.916
Right.

958
01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.083
So it was the girl. for money.

959
01:24:46.666 --> 01:24:48.291
It's over.

960
01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:50.625
It's over. that's it.

961
01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:52.125
<i>It's the end.</i>

962
01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:54.708
<i>No. not necessarily.</i>

963
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:56.208
<i>It doesn't have to be.</i>

964
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.083
<i>We can offer a sum</i>
<i>and see how she responds.</i>

965
01:24:59.166 --> 01:25:02.750
<i>Then we'll know at least</i>
<i>if she's really the one behind this.</i>

966
01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:18.416
Marta?

967
01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:46.208
-Where's Marta?
-What the fuck. dude?

968
01:25:46.291 --> 01:25:48.916
Hey. man. you can't come in!

969
01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.458
Out.

970
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.708
Get out!

971
01:26:08.916 --> 01:26:09.791
What are you doing?

972
01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:13.041
-You came for your stuff. right?
-Yes.

973
01:26:13.625 --> 01:26:15.708
Okay. it's there. In the closet.

974
01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:22.833
Smashed to pieces.
They say it's the best way. I don't know.

975
01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:25.416
Don't you feel sick?

976
01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:29.375
When I saw you
talking to him in the same tone.

977
01:26:29.458 --> 01:26:31.083
with the same words.

978
01:26:31.166 --> 01:26:33.791
with the same fucking lies…
Don't you make yourself sick?

979
01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:37.666
I wanted to throw up so badly…
Actually. I did throw up.

980
01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:41.250
Yes. run away. very good.

981
01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:45.375
Fuck you. dude. do you hear me?
And publish whatever you want!

982
01:26:45.875 --> 01:26:49.125
But if you want to screw that guy.
you'll have to fuck him yourself.

983
01:26:49.625 --> 01:26:50.791
You hear me?

I'll head there in a few days.

What about Ángel?

997
01:28:21.041 --> 01:28:22.666
Nothing. It didn't work.

998
01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.791
I gave him the bait. but he didn't bite.

999
01:28:27.791 --> 01:28:28.666
He got scared.

1000
01:28:29.666 --> 01:28:32.625
At the last minute.
he pulled up his pants and left.

1001
01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:35.166
He has it all. He's boring and a coward.

1002
01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:40.666
But he's pretty much out.
The heads of the party want to get rid.

1003
01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:45.750
They need room for their own.
Ángel now has no patrons in the party.

1004
01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.625
So we've been wasting our time.

1005
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.166
I can try something else if you want…

1006
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:59.125
No. if you're sure.
it seems there's no point in persisting.

1007
01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:00.458

-Where is she?

-What the fuck are you doing?
-She has nothing to do with the case.

1012
01:30:26.666 --> 01:30:28.375
That's for a judge to decide.

1013
01:30:28.458 --> 01:30:30.750
She only worked in the house.
I have it all logged.

1014
01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:32.708
That's the problem. Juan.

1015
01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:37.500
-You should share a bit more.
-What did Galán promise you?

1016
01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:45.208
You're being a fool. Juan.

1017
01:30:46.333 --> 01:30:47.583
You know that. right?

1018
01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:51.333
As soon as I get her a lawyer.
you have to let her go.

1019
01:30:51.416 --> 01:30:52.583
You have nothing.

1020
01:30:53.708 --> 01:30:54.541
Nothing.

1021
01:30:54.625 --> 01:30:57.541
Did you know
your friend not only keeps bad company…

1022
01:30:58.333 --> 01:31:00.333
but doesn't have her work permit in order?

1023
01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:04.333
Yeah. big shot. That's right.

1024
01:31:05.375 --> 01:31:06.708
So behave yourself.

1025
01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:09.708
Or I'll see to it personally

1026
01:31:09.791 --> 01:31:13.583
that the Filipina you're shagging
is deported back to her fucking country.

1027
01:31:14.541 --> 01:31:15.375
Is that clear?

1028
01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.875

-Charo.

why would you stop it?

01:32:13.458 --> 01:32:14.291
Right.

1041
01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:21.291
You're using me as a safety clause
so they can't fuck you over. is that it?

1042
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:24.500
If it all goes badly.
I'll be really fucked indeed.

1043
01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.291
but you'll have the exclusive you wanted.

1044
01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:29.541
Is that a good deal?

1045
01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:33.583
-I don't want you to…
-If that moment comes. be careful.

1046
01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:37.333
If anyone knows
what you're doing. they'll stop you.

1047
01:32:37.416 --> 01:32:40.166
Let's think it through.
There must be another way.

1048
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:43.375
-Let's think about it.
-There's no more thinking left. Charo.

1049
01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:45.916
It is what it is.

1050
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:48.583
But why me?

1051
01:32:50.375 --> 01:32:53.375
You're the first on my list.
I always told you that.

1052
01:33:19.916 --> 01:33:20.791
Can we talk?

1053
01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:23.666
Yeah. sure. Sorry.

1054
01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:30.041
Those old geezers were driving me mad.

1055
01:33:30.125 --> 01:33:32.833
-Especially Manchado…
-How long have you been following me?

1056
01:33:38.583 --> 01:33:39.750
No family.

1057
01:33:40.958 --> 01:33:42.583
No romantic relationships.

1058
01:33:43.291 --> 01:33:44.250
No vices.

1059
01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:46.208
Too much control.

1060
01:33:46.291 --> 01:33:49.208
Sooner or later.
it had to burst somewhere.

1061
01:33:49.291 --> 01:33:52.708
And eventually. of course…
that Filipina got you whipped.

1062
01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:56.958
-Now you can screw me over.
-No one wants to screw you over. Juan.

1063
01:33:57.583 --> 01:33:59.041
We just want to trust you.

1064
01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:00.833
As we do with Ángel González.

1065
01:34:03.458 --> 01:34:05.583
We set him up. He's clean.

1066
01:34:05.666 --> 01:34:08.583
In the end. the clean people
turn out to be the most dangerous.

1067
01:34:09.666 --> 01:34:13.166
Nothing more unpredictable
than a politician with no secrets.

1068
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:15.666
When they get a little power.
they become caustic.

1069
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.375
start to have their own ideas.

1070
01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:22.083
Some insist on doing what they promised.
Look under the rug. do some cleaning up…

1071
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:23.666
And that's the end.

1072
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:26.250
-For us?
-For everyone. Juan.

1073
01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:29.208
We live in a world of balance.

1074
01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:33.000
A very delicate fabric
woven over many years.

1075
01:34:33.083 --> 01:34:35.708
and if someone
insists on pulling the thread…

1076
01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:37.916
Anyway.

1077
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.375
since you worry so much
about our friend. don't worry.

1078
01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:44.166
Things will go well
for him from now on. Very well.

1079
01:34:44.833 --> 01:34:49.000
What? His profile is great for the cleanup
the voters are crying out for.

1080
01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:53.791
Besides. we know no one will find anything
on him. beyond that little slip.

1081
01:34:55.041 --> 01:34:57.916
I have to go.
they're giving me this damn medal.

1082
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
So if you brought me any presents…

1083
01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:16.875
-She stays clean.
-Clean.

1084
01:35:16.958 --> 01:35:19.541
-They won't deport her.
-They won't deport her.

1085
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:30.833
Juan. how about we forget about all this?
What do you think? Like it never happened.

1086
01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.791
We need you. dammit.
There's so much work to do.

1087
01:35:36.791 --> 01:35:39.416
Alright. I have to go.

1088
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:16.666
Are you okay?

1089
01:36:18.875 --> 01:36:19.708
Yes.

1090
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:21.958
Now I am.

1091
01:36:25.333 --> 01:36:26.208
I'm sorry.

1092
01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:40.208
What is it?

1093
01:36:41.625 --> 01:36:43.791
Everything you need is in here.

1094
01:37:03.583 --> 01:37:04.500
Just one ticket.

1095
01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:18.500
And you?

1096
01:37:20.416 --> 01:37:22.375
I have things to settle here.

1097
01:37:26.833 --> 01:37:27.666
One thing.

1098
01:37:29.458 --> 01:37:30.666
Is your name Álex?

1099
01:37:34.625 --> 01:37:35.666
Juan.

1100
01:37:37.875 --> 01:37:38.750
Abaday.

1101
01:37:40.791 --> 01:37:41.625
That's my name.

1102
01:37:42.541 --> 01:37:45.291
The agency said it didn't sound Filipino.

1103
01:37:46.916 --> 01:37:50.083
That I'd better chose
something more… normal.

1104
01:37:52.208 --> 01:37:53.041
Abaday.

1105
01:38:28.416 --> 01:38:30.708
A guest house by the sea.

1106
01:38:32.333 --> 01:38:34.083
Run by seven sisters.

1107
01:38:36.333 --> 01:38:37.333
I'll be there.
