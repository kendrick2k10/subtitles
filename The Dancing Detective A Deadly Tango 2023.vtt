- (phones ringing)

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.519
Oh...

9
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.187
Next time. I'm giving you
a ticket. Ralph.

10
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.731
You wanted
to see me. Captain?

11
00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.316
Bailey. take a seat.

12
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.944
Great.

13
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.157
Nice job
on the Collymore case.

14
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.700
Ah. Thank you. sir.

15
00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:42.203
Heaven knows what made you sift
through 1600 personnel files

16
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.123
to find the only two employees
who both studied botany.

17
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.332
I was just being thorough.

18
00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.168
Well. that's one word for it.

19
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.711
"Obsessive" might be another.

20
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.421
I'm not obsessive.

21
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.381
The devil is
in the details. sir.

22
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.883
You know. you could've asked
Sergeant Beaumont

23
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.217
to help you with that.

24
00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.303
Oh. he was busy with other
aspects of the case.

25
00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.804
What other aspects?

26
00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.849
Beaumont tells me you barely
let him make coffee.

27
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.809
I let him do things.

28
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.354
Bailey. you're a great detective
and you get results.

29
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:10.315
but you've got to learn how to
work well with other people.

30
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.983
I do work well
with other people.

31
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.903
Not according to Beaumont
or Reynolds or Whittaker.

32
00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.364
You've been through three
partners in three years

33
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.699
and all because you insist on
doing everything yourself.

34
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.202
Right. because I just like
things done correctly.

35
00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.870
Bailey. have you ever wondered

36
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.582
why you haven't had
a promotion in five years?

37
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.835
If you want to get ahead.
you gotta... loosen the reins.

38
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.879
you gotta learn how
to be a little flexible.

39
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.714
I can be flexible.

40
00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:37.926
Well. we'll see.

41
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.554
Have you heard of Mark Aston?

42
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.473
Any relation to Senator Aston?

43
00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.934
Yeah. his brother.
and he's dead.

44
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.436
Possibly suspicious. yesterday.

45
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.230
Wait. Why are we just
hearing about this?

46
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.648
It happened in Malta.

47
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.732
Oh.

48
00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.776
Yeah. quite the
jet-setters. the Astons.

49
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.820
proper global socialites.

50
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.825
Anyway. the Senator is insisting
that we send our best detective.

51
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.743
Really? Interesting.

52
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.328
It's being coordinated
through Interpol.

53
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.831
But. uh. I don't know. Bailey.

54
00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.083
could you work with
someone in Malta?

55
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:11.960
Sir. I can work with anyone.

56
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.255
Well. they might do things
a little different there.

57
00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:18.049
You might have to go
with the flow a little bit.

58
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.719
Oh. I can go with the flow.
I can totally go with the flow.

59
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.679
Absolutely.

60
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.973
I mean. we don't even know for
sure if Aston was murdered.

61
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:28.226
I mean. he ran some kind of...
ballroom dance company.

62
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.603
for heaven's sake.

63
00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.189
But if there was foul play.
this could be big for you.

64
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.650
career-wise.
what with Interpol watching.

65
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.610
I get it.

66
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:40.447
I get it. and I can--
I can absolutely do this.

67
00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:44.659
Okay. Bailey.
I'll take a chance.

68
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.621
But you've got to tread lightly.
and remember. collaborate.

69
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.957
I can collaborate with anyone.

70
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.711
Thank you.

71
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:07.682
*

72
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.948
Thank you. sir.

73
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.494
Detective Constance Bailey?

74
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:29.496
Yes. Bailey is fine;
it's what everyone calls me.

75
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.747
Sergeant Spiteri?

76
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.208
Ana. Interpol asked me
to be your liaison.

77
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.334
Okay.
Very nice to meet you. Ana.

78
00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.127
So. what's the plan?

79
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.420
Well. before you
check into the hotel.

80
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.464
I thought I'd share
with you some case details

81
00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.508
and introduce you
to your partner.

82
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.468
Okay. great.
Is there any way my--

83
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.221
my jet lag could meet
some coffee along the way?

84
00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.722
Sure. My car's just over there.

85
00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.224
Okay. good.

86
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.309
(horn honking)

87
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.310
Man: Careful. love.

88
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.311
(brakes screeching)

89
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.688
Enjoy your stay!

90
00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.231
(horn honking)

91
00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.066
Can you believe that guy?

92
00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.402
Sorry.
We drive on the left here.

93
00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.028
I should have told you
to look the other way.

94
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.072
He was still going way too fast.
but I think I got the plate.

95
00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:12.789
*

96
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.668
Ah. that's better.

97
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.670
All right. let's walk and talk.
Less ears that way.

98
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:28.555
So. two days ago. Mark Aston.
the CEO of Aston International.

99
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.724
is found dead
at the Iniala Hotel.

100
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.059
It's a resort
overlooking the Grand Harbor.

101
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.561
And his death is suspicious?

102
00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.563
Well. he's a wealthy American
with no health issues.

103
00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.732
He was found lying
on the floor of his room.

104
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.400
There was a glass
by his hand

105
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.652
with a few indications
of possible poisoning.

106
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.154
Do you have a toxicology report?

107
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.489
No. not yet.
It may take a few days.

108
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.241
but that may be too late.

109
00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.909
What do you mean "too late"?

110
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.121
Aston was about to host his
team-building event.

111
00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:56.207
where senior executives get to
compete in a dance competition.

112
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.876
A dance competition?

113
00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.753
Yes. that is what
Aston International does.

114
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.921
They have ballroom
dance schools all over the world

115
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.549
and they hold annual dance
competitions around the world.

116
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.509
Have you not seen them before?
Sometimes they're on TV.

117
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.261
It's really not my thing.

118
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.055
Well. Aston believed

119
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.432
that his executives would
understand the business better

120
00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.642
if they had
the opportunity to compete.

121
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.270
So. him and his wife hold
an annual dance competition.

122
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.774
The event is this weekend.
Then. everybody flies home.

123
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.902
But if it is murder. our
potential suspects could be gone

124
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.820
by the time we get
confirmation of foul play.

125
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.281
Yes. which is
why we need someone now

126
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.617
to compete and investigate.

127
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.745
Wait. Hang on.
Did you say compete?

128
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.457
Interpol said you have
done undercover work.

129
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.502
Well. sure. undercover -

130
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.463
a lab technician.
an accountant -

131
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.924
normal things.
but not ballroom dancer.

132
00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.093
Oh. these are not
professional dancers.

133
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.136
They're just executives
and their partners.

134
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.638
not real dancers.

135
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.973
I've never danced
a day in my life.

136
00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.852
(sighing)
Look. I really--

137
00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.605
I really
want to go with the flow.

138
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.401
but I do not see how I credibly
enter a dance competition.

139
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.194
Oh. you don't need
to worry about that.

140
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.279
We have taken care
of everything.

141
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.490
- How?
- We found you a dance partner.

142
00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.992
He'll also play your husband.

143
00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.328
What?

144
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.706
I...
(clearing throat)

145
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.166
Great.

146
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.714
(sighing)

147
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:34.931
(music playing softly over P.A.)

148
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.516
This is Sebastian.

149
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.643
Oh. He looks kind of familiar.

150
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.061
Oh. you like musicals. then?

151
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.647
I do not.

152
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.733
Wait. Where have I seen him?

153
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.027
Ana: In the magazines maybe?

154
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.486
I think he's what
you call "a bad boy".

155
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.738
He has dated many famous women.

156
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.573
No. no. no. that's not it.

157
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.658
But wait. if he's famous won't--
won't he blow my cover?

158
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.035
People might recognize him.

159
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.537
Famous?
Oh. no. no. no. not so much.

160
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.289
These posters are old.

161
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.291
He's more of
a star in his own mind.

162
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.422
(big band music playing)

163
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.508
Leslie! Oh. yes.

164
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.052
(big band music playing)

165
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.720
Love it. Leslie.

166
00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.597
Winifred. attitude - love it.

167
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.892
And yes. yes. yes.

168
00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.268
Yes. Come on!

169
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.187
Are you sure this guy can help?

170
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.230
Oh. yes. He has already agreed.

171
00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.232
Sebastian: Oh. let me in.
let me in. let me in.

172
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.692
Woman: Oh!

173
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.071
You two are just too gorgeous.
Come on. There we go.

174
00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:34.199
(big band music playing)

175
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.451
Away!

176
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.952
You've told him about the case?

177
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.704
Oh. well. I had to find you
someone who could teach you

178
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.248
to dance and pretend
to be your husband.

179
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.583
and was already in Malta.

180
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.918
Sebastian: That's right. smile!

181
00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.128
He's perfect.

182
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.922
(big band music playing)

183
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.006
Here we go!

184
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.258
Okay. everyone.

185
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.679
He can teach you to dance and he
will make a good undercover.

186
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.056
I just can't have him
interfering with my case.

187
00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.641
No. no. no.

188
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:03.603
I'm sure he will just
help with the dancing.

189
00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.731
(big band music playing)

190
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.275
Ann!
Up and down!

191
00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:12.737
Up and down! Up and down!

192
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.614
Why does he have
to be my husband?

193
00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.200
That is your cover.
We had to set it up quickly.

194
00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.328
Interpol got an inside contact
at Aston's head office

195
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.205
through his brother.
the Senator.

196
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.958
They made papers for you that
you are a new employee

197
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.086
hired directly
by Mr. Aston.

198
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:31.339
and invited here...
with your husband.

199
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.466
Mm. Great. Okay.

200
00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:34.718
Okay. everyone.
you lovely people.

201
00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.136
you look amazing.

202
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.264
- Go with the flow.
- Sebastian: Shimmy!

203
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.807
(big band music playing)

204
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:44.310
Big finale. Gladys.
Come on. Florie!

205
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:49.065
(big band music playing)

206
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.988
Ah. ladies.
I'll be right with you.

207
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.365
Right.

208
00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:00.618
Okay. everybody. nice work.

209
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.245
Good place to stop. I think.

210
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.330
But remember.
I'm supposed to be teaching you.

211
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.291
not the other way around.

212
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.752
Okay.

213
00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:12.297
Ah. Well. well. well...

214
00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.424
My wife.

215
00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.051
Mm. hello.

216
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.802
Oh. someone's not looking
forward to this. are they?

217
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.304
How could you tell?

218
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.098
Well. you see. Constance.
dancers read body language.

219
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.059
It's kind of
one of our superpowers.

220
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.729
Bailey.
Everybody calls her Bailey.

221
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.356
I used to have a
second cousin called Constance.

222
00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.732
She was great fun.

223
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.025
A bit of a terror
at parties. though.

224
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.318
Huh.

225
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.153
Right.

226
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.988
Shall we see what I have
to work with. Constance?

227
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.323
Bailey. It's Detective Bailey.

228
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:42.160
Oh. Detective.
Oh. I love detectives. yes.

229
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.663
Aunt Vera and I watched
them all - Starsky and Hutch.

230
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.832
Miss Marple. Perry Mason.

231
00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.876
Yes. I've even
played a detective.

232
00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.921
Kind of a
detective expert. actually.

233
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.172
Oh. that's great. Columbo.

234
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.882
but I just need a
really quick dance lesson.

235
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.592
Oh. you need
a little more than that.

236
00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.802
What's that supposed to mean?

237
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.554
Well. you look like a detective.

238
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.766
and you walk like a detective.

239
00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.852
and I'm guessing you'll
dance like a detective.

240
00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.896
If you're going to
pull this off.

241
00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.941
you're going to have
to let your hair down.

242
00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.526
Great.

243
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.487
Literally.
The ponytail's got to go.

244
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:21.574
Oh. Okay. fine.
Right. yeah.

245
00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.202
- I'll just go with the flow.
- Great. That's much better.

246
00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.788
Now. come here.

247
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.165
(inhaling sharply)
Big deep breath and...

248
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.750
(inhaling sharply)

249
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.920
(exhaling sharply)
...let it all go.

250
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.338
- Let it go. Let it go.
- What is happening?

251
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.048
Shh. It's okay.

252
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.802
Okay. Now. we're going
to start basic frame.

253
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:45.724
Foxtrot rhythm -
slow. slow. quick. quick. slow.

254
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:49.394
Okay? And step forward
with the left foot.

255
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.147
And slow. slow. quick. quick.

256
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.024
Hello. foxy.
That's it. to the side.

257
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.483
- Nice.
- Oh. nice. Okay.

258
00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:56.735
Same again. but just backwards.

259
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.777
What?

260
00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.154
Backwards. with the right foot.

261
00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:00.780
- Ready?
- Right. right foot.

262
00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.532
And here we go.

263
00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:05.535
Slow. slow. quick. slo--

264
00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.619
(grunting)

265
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.455
Sorry. Oh. yeah. sorry.

266
00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.581
No. no. it's fine.

267
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.832
You're very. very.
very determined.

268
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.208
I'm sorry. I just..

269
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.960
Okay. yes. Uh...

270
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.921
let's continue the lessons
at the resort. shall we?

271
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.966
Um. I am going to get the car

272
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.427
because we have to go
and get our wardrobes.

273
00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.055
You okay?

274
00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.639
Oh. yeah. No. this is great.

275
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.099
You're doing well.

276
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.019
Yeah.
That was... fabulous.

277
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.646
Okay for me to
leave you with him?

278
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:34.773
Yeah. sure.

279
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.316
I'll go back to the station.

280
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.568
They should have gotten more
details about the guests now.

281
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.944
I'll bring them to you.

282
00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.446
Okay. great. Just text me
where you want to meet.

283
00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:43.615
And what time should
we check in at the hotel?

284
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.158
In time for lunch?
I'll see you soon.

285
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.451
Thank you.

286
00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.245
(horn honking)

287
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.832
I knew it.

288
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.000
I knew I recognized you.

289
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.877
Oh. I get that a lot.

290
00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.545
No. it's probably from
my many roles in the theatre.

291
00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:59.089
No. it's the plates.

292
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.633
You were the maniac who nearly
ran me over this morning.

293
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.010
Oh. the jaywalker.

294
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.059
You do know they drive
on the left here.

295
00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.728
(engine revving)

296
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:23.947
*

297
00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.746
Here are the people closest
to Mr. Aston who matter.

298
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.456
Okay. based on?

299
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.041
Two things: motive -

300
00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.293
they are now on the running
to take over the company -

301
00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.753
and opportunity -

302
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.714
they all checked in
before Mr. Aston died.

303
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.882
Most of the other
guests arrived today.

304
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:44.384
We will have more soon.

305
00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.886
Interpol are still
gathering details.

306
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.889
Okay. Let's talk backstories.

307
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.183
Now. what do we know about
Sally and her husband?

308
00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.560
Wait. Who?

309
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.895
Well. when Sergeant Spiteri
here offered me the gig.

310
00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.897
I told her to
check us into the resort

311
00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.733
at Stuart and Sally Miller.

312
00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.151
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

313
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.778
This is not a gig. okay?
This is a murder investigation.

314
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.572
And we are undercover.

315
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:08.074
We need aliases and backstories.

316
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.784
So. Stuart and Sally?

317
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.245
Did you ever watch
McMillan and Wife?

318
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.914
Stuart and Sally McMillan?
Married...

319
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.624
and solved murders.

320
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.084
Oh. wow. that's great.

321
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.627
You know. why don't you just go
with - I don't know -

322
00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.129
Jonathan and Jennifer Hart?

323
00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.632
Well. you don't want to be
too obvious. Constance.

324
00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.885
That's why
I changed McMillan...

325
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.137
to Miller.

326
00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.097
Oh...

327
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.442
(American accent:) Howdy.

328
00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:46.529
I'm Stuart Miller and this
is my lady wife Sally.

329
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.615
(Scottish accent:)
Hi. How are you doing?

330
00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:52.035
My name's Stuart Miller
and this is my wife Sally.

331
00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.454
(New York accent:)
Hey. how you doing?

332
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.790
I'm Stuart.
this is Sal. my wife.

333
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.375
What are you doing?

334
00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.460
(regular voice:) Oh. I'm just.
you know. finding my character.

335
00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:03.797
What do you think?
Texas? Scottish. East Coast?

336
00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.299
Oh. is that what those were?

337
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.051
You know.
I'm just trying them out.

338
00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.637
That way.
I can then hone one of them.

339
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:13.306
Right. You know. but why don't
you just use your regular voice?

340
00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:16.935
Oh. you like
my English accent. do you?

341
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.688
Of the option's available. yes.

342
00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:32.367
*

343
00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.134
Darling. isn't this wonderful?

344
00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.593
Oh. absolutely.

345
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.680
Thank you.
Reminds me of our honeymoon.

346
00:16:56.099 --> 00:17:00.186
Oh. What do you think?
Time for a ride later?

347
00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.398
Oh. yes. maybe later. Mm-hmm.

348
00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.651
Seriously?

349
00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.126
How are you. Mary?

350
00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:26.880
It's not every day that...
one's husband dies.

351
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.132
(sighing)

352
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.217
Can I do anything?

353
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.360
Wow.

354
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:53.948
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

355
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.701
We've got it from here.

356
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.037
(sighing contentedly)

357
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:02.207
Oh. wow. look at that view.

358
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.212
Wow.

359
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.839
Oh...
Beautiful.

360
00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.466
- (knocking)
- Hello?

361
00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.426
- Ahh.
- Hello.

362
00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.220
Hello.

363
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.638
It's a stunning view. isn't it?

364
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.515
Both: It is.

365
00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:22.477
Barbara Stone -
Aston International. Welcome.

366
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.563
The last-minute additions?
We just got the paperwork.

367
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.107
I only just joined
the company last week.

368
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:30.193
but Mr. Aston insisted we come.

369
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:33.279
But then.
we heard he'd passed and...

370
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:34.948
I know. and we really
didn't know what to do.

371
00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.449
Oh. you did the right thing.

372
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.120
The competition is going ahead.
if you can't believe it.

373
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.956
Does anyone know
what happened to Mr. Aston?

374
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.958
They're not sure.

375
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.127
But you know these
workaholic bosses -

376
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.753
no sense of perspective.

377
00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.047
They work themselves
and those around them

378
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:54.009
into the ground...
literally.

379
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.554
But the competition
is still going ahead.

380
00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:01.349
Mrs. Aston says that's what
her husband would have wanted.

381
00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:06.187
They take the annual company
dance very seriously here.

382
00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:09.190
It's why all senior
executives have to compete.

383
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.986
Anyway.
lunch is in half an hour.

384
00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.154
so you have time to freshen up.

385
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.156
I'll see you down there.

386
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.699
Thank you.

387
00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.832
(sighing)

388
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.876
Okay. Romeo.

389
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.720
Wow. this is incredible.

390
00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:44.309
Oh. hi.

391
00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.643
Welcome to the inner circle.

392
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.063
You'll be seated
at the top table.

393
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.065
- Oh. great.
- Oh.

394
00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.192
(phone chiming)

395
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.527
I'll catch up with you shortly.

396
00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:56.029
Okay.

397
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.572
- Ooh. this is the good bit.
- Huh?

398
00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.616
The meet the suspects moment.

399
00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:03.328
Someone in this room
is the murderer.

400
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.330
Okay listen. Miss Marple.
let's just have lunch

401
00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.207
and leave
the detective work to me.

402
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.626
Oh. absolutely...
partner.

403
00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.843
(chattering)

404
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.136
Hello.

405
00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:21.346
Oh. hello.

406
00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.473
Hello. everyone.

407
00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.892
I'm Stuart Miller and this
is my lovely wife Sally.

408
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.520
Sally. Barbara tells me
you've just joined.

409
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.189
Welcome. I'm Mary Aston.

410
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.524
It's so nice to meet you.

411
00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.025
Very sorry to hear
about your husband.

412
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.694
Mary: Oh. thank you. dear.

413
00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:38.613
But Mark would have wanted us
to continue business as usual.

414
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.990
so I'm glad you could come.

415
00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:44.744
If you have any questions.
always feel free to talk to me.

416
00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.247
If I'm not at the hotel. you'll
find me down at the harbor.

417
00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:51.084
We have a boat docked there -
the Duchess.

418
00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.794
Hang on. You've just joined?

419
00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.045
Yes.

420
00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:56.006
How did you get
invited to this?

421
00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.258
Mary. thought
the invitations this year

422
00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.635
were supposed to be
performance-based.

423
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.930
Tom...
Mark invited them himself.

424
00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:09.227
And my husband here is actually
a very experienced dancer.

425
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.104
Ah. I dabble.

426
00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:12.355
(people exclaiming)

427
00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.524
That explains it.

428
00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:16.443
You married a dancer.

429
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.737
That's one way to
get ahead here. isn't it?

430
00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.489
Tom. I doubt Sally married her
husband on the off chance that.

431
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.658
one day. she would
get to work at this company.

432
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.077
You never know
what people will do.

433
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:29.039
Stuart. Sally.

434
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.915
this is Tom Stevens - our CFO.

435
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:34.377
You'll have to
excuse his behavior.

436
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.795
I'm sure it's just...

437
00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:39.215
shock from
the sad news about Mark.

438
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.761
Tom: Ah. yes.
you're right Jennifer.

439
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.262
Sorry.

440
00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.222
Jennifer Tate -
head of marketing.

441
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:47.640
Pleasure.

442
00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:50.769
It's nice to welcome
such a lovely couple.

443
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.063
We're looking forward
to seeing your moves.

444
00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:54.439
Aren't we all?

445
00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.399
I'm Kevin Hamilton -
events director.

446
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.817
Very nice to meet you.

447
00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.694
So. where are
everyone's partners?

448
00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.446
We can't be the only
married couple here.

449
00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:02.989
Divorcee.

450
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.908
Unmarried.

451
00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.826
Happily single.

452
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.873
Um....

453
00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:14.125
Well. I really look forward to
getting to know all of you.

454
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.710
And I apologize in advance

455
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.797
if I bombard you with questions
as I get up to speed.

456
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.466
Bombard away.
we're one big happy family here.

457
00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:23.510
Yes. absolutely.

458
00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:26.638
Maybe we could get some
dancing tips from your husband.

459
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.682
if you're not feeling
too competitive.

460
00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.767
Oh. I'm sure he'd be glad
to share his expertise.

461
00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:31.935
No. I...

462
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.186
would be delighted.

463
00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:34.896
Hi.

464
00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:37.107
Um. we're just getting
ready to serve lunch.

465
00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:39.442
Everyone enjoying themselves?

466
00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:41.194
Oh. yes. We're just
telling Stuart and Sally

467
00:22:41.236 --> 00:22:43.154
how we're one big happy family.

468
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.824
Oh.

469
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.201
Well. nothing's more
important than family.

470
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.163
Thanks.

471
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.970
So. who do you
think the killer is?

472
00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:09.055
Can you just stop doing that
thing with your sunglasses?

473
00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:10.598
Yep.

474
00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:15.979
I think it's the wife -
Mary Aston.

475
00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:17.856
What?
She barely said two words.

476
00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:20.483
Yeah. but she wasn't exactly
grief-stricken. though. was she?

477
00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:23.403
Well. some people do
keep things on the inside.

478
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:26.197
Not everyone
wants to... put on a show.

479
00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:29.367
Maybe. But I think she's
definitely having an affair

480
00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:30.702
with that Hamilton chap.

481
00:23:30.744 --> 00:23:33.038
What?
Oh. hold on. Jessica Fletcher.

482
00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.497
What is that based on?

483
00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.791
Uh. instinct.

484
00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.918
Yeah. something
about their body language.

485
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.628
the way they looked
at each other.

486
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.215
Okay. you've seen way
too many detective shows.

487
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:46.092
All right. let's do this.

488
00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.686
Man on phone: I can't believe
what I'm looking at right now.

489
00:23:56.728 --> 00:23:58.897
No. I'm serious.

490
00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:00.440
That's what I'm saying.
It's beautiful.

491
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:01.816
You've got to come join.

492
00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:03.943
What do you make
of the new girl?

493
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:07.030
I don't think
she's a threat.

494
00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:11.826
I wouldn't be surprised if Aston
hired her for her husband.

495
00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:15.372
Never could resist
the cute dancer.

496
00:24:15.413 --> 00:24:16.915
It's one thing
we had in common.

497
00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:18.458
Yes.

498
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.420
Well. Mark Aston won't be
doing any dancing now. will he?

499
00:24:22.462 --> 00:24:24.589
This couldn't have worked out
better if you had planned it.

500
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:26.925
What are you talking about?

501
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:30.053
Come on. we both know
how ambitious you are.

502
00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:33.098
Aston's sudden demise
is rather convenient for you.

503
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:35.433
For me? What about you?

504
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:36.601
Me?

505
00:24:36.643 --> 00:24:38.770
Look. spare me
the mock outrage. okay?

506
00:24:38.812 --> 00:24:41.773
Neither of us
were fans of Aston.

507
00:24:41.815 --> 00:24:44.859
To be honest.
I wouldn't think any less of you

508
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:47.320
if you played
a part in his demise.

509
00:24:47.362 --> 00:24:50.156
Quite the contrary.

510
00:24:50.198 --> 00:24:52.117
I suppose with Mark gone.

511
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:56.121
now you can roll out your new
campaign globally after all.

512
00:24:56.162 --> 00:24:58.248
What a great shop
window for your talents.

513
00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:59.290
You must be delighted.

514
00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:02.043
Almost as delighted
as you must be.

515
00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:03.962
now that you're in line
for the top job.

516
00:25:04.004 --> 00:25:07.340
All right.
We can both benefit from this.

517
00:25:07.382 --> 00:25:09.384
So. let's just try to
watch out for one another.

518
00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:11.177
Okay?

519
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.810
(church bell ringing)

520
00:25:18.852 --> 00:25:22.647
(soft music playing)

521
00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:24.899
How is this helping?

522
00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:26.693
Dancers maintain connection.

523
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:28.570
You can't feel
self-conscious about it.

524
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:31.281
We support each other.
we move as one.

525
00:25:31.322 --> 00:25:33.408
Again.

526
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.827
And slow. slow.

527
00:25:35.869 --> 00:25:38.455
Quick. quick. quick.
Promenade.

528
00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:42.292
Slow. You got it.

529
00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:43.460
That's it. You've got it.

530
00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:44.836
Right. it's just.
you know. we're outside.

531
00:25:44.878 --> 00:25:46.546
people are around.
it's kind of embarrassing.

532
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:47.881
Well. there's going
to be a lot of people

533
00:25:47.922 --> 00:25:49.299
watching us tomorrow night.

534
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:51.051
Look. connection is critical.

535
00:25:51.092 --> 00:25:54.387
But remember.
dance is happiness.

536
00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:56.681
You've got to feel it. live it.

537
00:25:56.723 --> 00:25:59.809
show it off. and smile.

538
00:25:59.851 --> 00:26:02.228
What if I don't
feel like smiling?

539
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.730
Like. say - I don't know -

540
00:26:03.772 --> 00:26:06.191
I'm in the middle of a
potential homicide investigation

541
00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:09.527
with a crazy Englishman who
thinks he's a TV detective.

542
00:26:09.569 --> 00:26:11.154
Well. like most good things.

543
00:26:11.196 --> 00:26:14.032
dance involves
a little make-believe.

544
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:16.326
Keeps you from taking
yourself too seriously.

545
00:26:16.368 --> 00:26:17.744
What?

546
00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:19.746
You think I take
myself too seriously?

547
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:23.041
All I'm saying is keep it light.

548
00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:25.919
And remember.
our expressions tell a story.

549
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.837
Imagine you've fallen in love.

550
00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:30.090
Find that expression

551
00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:33.468
and maintain it
throughout the dance.

552
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.887
And...

553
00:26:35.929 --> 00:26:37.722
*

554
00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:40.183
So. which suspect
should we target first?

555
00:26:40.225 --> 00:26:43.228
Let's just finish
the dance lesson. Poirot?

556
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:47.899
*

557
00:26:58.952 --> 00:27:08.920
*

558
00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:22.308
(camera shutter clicking)

559
00:27:23.768 --> 00:27:24.978
(camera shutter clicking)

560
00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:27.480
(phone dialing. ringing)

561
00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:28.982
Hi.

562
00:27:29.024 --> 00:27:30.900
What a crazy few days.

563
00:27:30.942 --> 00:27:32.944
Anyway.
I've sent you the papers.

564
00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:35.321
I'm getting out of here.

565
00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:39.868
What? Why?

566
00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:44.164
Fine. but I'm charging extra.

567
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:53.298
Oh. really?

568
00:27:59.137 --> 00:28:01.014
- (clearing throat)
- What are you doing?

569
00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:04.100
Nothing.

570
00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:06.061
On the dock. you said
that we tell stories

571
00:28:06.102 --> 00:28:07.479
with our expressions.
so I was...

572
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.980
I was just practicing.

573
00:28:09.022 --> 00:28:13.318
Oh. And what's the story?
"Help. I need a doctor"?

574
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.613
It's time to start digging.

575
00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:18.198
We need to get to
know our suspects.

576
00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:20.241
You know what. I'm going
to go chat with Mary Aston.

577
00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:26.581
What are you putting
on your face?

578
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:28.041
Oh. it's a wrinkle mask.

579
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:29.876
Very useful after a lot of sun.
You should try it.

580
00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:35.715
Why don't you let me
chat to Mrs. Aston?

581
00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:37.050
Sebastian. this is not a game.

582
00:28:37.092 --> 00:28:38.468
There's a potential
murderer at large.

583
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.678
Oh. I know. No. I know.

584
00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:41.012
and I get it. I do.

585
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:43.348
but there are a lot
of people to question.

586
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.684
Might look a bit weird
if you approach them all.

587
00:28:45.725 --> 00:28:49.979
Just tell me what you need
to know and I will ask her.

588
00:28:50.021 --> 00:28:52.440
I don't know.

589
00:28:52.482 --> 00:28:55.694
Come on. you've seen how easy it
is for people to open up to me.

590
00:28:55.735 --> 00:28:59.406
And besides.
we do need to collaborate.

591
00:28:59.447 --> 00:29:01.616
Collaborate?

592
00:29:01.658 --> 00:29:03.034
Also.

593
00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:05.829
Mary Aston thinks
of you as a clever executive.

594
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.330
She might be more inclined

595
00:29:07.372 --> 00:29:09.040
to let something slip
in front of the dumb husband.

596
00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:12.794
Oh. you do play
dumb very convincingly.

597
00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:15.672
And. that would free you
up to talk to her lover.

598
00:29:15.714 --> 00:29:18.758
There is absolutely no evidence
yet that Kevin Hamilton

599
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.843
is involved with her.

600
00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.970
Yet? Let's compare notes

601
00:29:22.012 --> 00:29:24.139
after our chats. shall we?

602
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.016
Look.
if I don't get what you need

603
00:29:26.057 --> 00:29:28.226
from Mrs. Aston. you can
always approach her later.

604
00:29:28.268 --> 00:29:31.604
But this way.
we cover more ground.

605
00:29:31.646 --> 00:29:33.898
See?

606
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.985
Not so dumb after all.

607
00:29:37.027 --> 00:29:40.030
The game is afoot.

608
00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:48.163
Trust me. I've got this
all under control.

609
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.217
(cannon firing)

610
00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:05.722
Thank you. Joy.
That's all for now.

611
00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:08.767
Hello.

612
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.560
Sally. Everything all right?

613
00:30:10.602 --> 00:30:12.103
Hi. Kevin.

614
00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:15.106
Yes. I just wanted to
come over and enjoy the view.

615
00:30:15.148 --> 00:30:16.900
Stunning. isn't it?

616
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:18.526
- Sit.
- Thank you.

617
00:30:18.568 --> 00:30:21.446
It really is.
It's just incredible.

618
00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:24.074
You seem a little nervous
about the competition.

619
00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:26.493
I'm more than a little nervous.
I'm a lot nervous.

620
00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:28.119
No need to be.
We're going to have fun.

621
00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:31.122
Oh. I hope so.
You know what?

622
00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:33.249
Would you mind if I asked you
just a few questions?

623
00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:34.751
Just to help myself
acclimatize.

624
00:30:34.793 --> 00:30:36.628
Of course. of course.
I'm just going through my list.

625
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.046
Ask away.

626
00:30:38.088 --> 00:30:39.255
So. you've been putting on these

627
00:30:39.297 --> 00:30:41.299
international
competitions for a while?

628
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:42.842
Ah. yes.

629
00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:44.219
Must have been decades ago

630
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.513
that Mary first asked me
to put something together.

631
00:30:46.554 --> 00:30:48.932
Oh. was it Mary's idea.
not Mark's?

632
00:30:48.973 --> 00:30:50.642
Mary was the driver.

633
00:30:50.684 --> 00:30:53.269
She's something
of a force of nature.

634
00:30:53.311 --> 00:30:54.604
You've known her a long time?

635
00:30:54.646 --> 00:30:56.439
Since we were teenagers.

636
00:30:56.481 --> 00:30:59.776
We used to dance together
in junior competitions.

637
00:30:59.818 --> 00:31:03.488
And then. years later. I heard
from her again. out of the blue.

638
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.241
she wanted to put on
a dance competition in Paris.

639
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:09.661
Well. we've been doing
international events ever since.

640
00:31:09.703 --> 00:31:11.079
That's incredible.

641
00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:15.125
You know. I was...
I was a little surprised

642
00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:17.460
when I heard everything was
going ahead.

643
00:31:17.502 --> 00:31:19.129
considering Mr. Aston just died.

644
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.757
Life is short. Sally.

645
00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:25.635
We all take happiness
where we can get it.

646
00:31:25.677 --> 00:31:29.597
I don't know how canceling a
happy event would help anyone.

647
00:31:29.639 --> 00:31:31.391
I guess I just
thought Mrs. Aston

648
00:31:31.433 --> 00:31:33.184
might be too upset to go on.

649
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.521
Mary is a very pragmatic woman.

650
00:31:36.563 --> 00:31:46.531
*

651
00:31:54.873 --> 00:31:56.458
Ahoy there!

652
00:31:56.499 --> 00:31:59.210
Oh. hello!

653
00:31:59.252 --> 00:32:01.129
I saw the boat
and I just couldn't resist

654
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:02.339
coming for a closer look.

655
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.007
Well. boats are nice to look at.

656
00:32:04.049 --> 00:32:06.426
Come and join me.

657
00:32:06.468 --> 00:32:08.720
Don't mind if I do.

658
00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:23.735
What a splendid view.
Mrs. Aston.

659
00:32:23.777 --> 00:32:25.362
Oh. call me Mary.

660
00:32:25.403 --> 00:32:27.572
Where's your lovely wife?

661
00:32:27.614 --> 00:32:30.283
Oh. you know. doing...
lovely wife stuff.

662
00:32:30.325 --> 00:32:31.868
(chuckling)

663
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.244
Between you and I.

664
00:32:33.286 --> 00:32:35.205
I think she's a bit nervous
about the competition.

665
00:32:35.246 --> 00:32:36.539
Aw. no need.

666
00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:38.500
She has you.

667
00:32:38.541 --> 00:32:40.543
Would you like
to sit down. Stuart?

668
00:32:40.585 --> 00:32:42.587
Oh. thank you.

669
00:32:45.757 --> 00:32:48.635
I appreciate that this must
be a difficult time for you.

670
00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:52.222
Your husband?

671
00:32:52.263 --> 00:32:54.599
Oh. yes. Well...

672
00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:56.893
it wasn't entirely unexpected.

673
00:32:56.935 --> 00:33:01.189
He did work himself and everyone
around him to the ground.

674
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:04.401
It became a bone of contention.

675
00:33:04.442 --> 00:33:06.861
Is Sally a workaholic.

676
00:33:06.903 --> 00:33:08.571
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

677
00:33:08.613 --> 00:33:10.949
Although. I'm sure that
she will work very hard for you.

678
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.910
Oh. it's okay.
This isn't a test.

679
00:33:13.952 --> 00:33:17.330
The fact is I don't expect
or want all our executives

680
00:33:17.372 --> 00:33:20.041
to be work-crazed monsters.
you know?

681
00:33:20.083 --> 00:33:21.835
Although.
we have a few of those.

682
00:33:21.876 --> 00:33:25.088
Ah.
(chuckling)

683
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.257
No. life isn't all about work.

684
00:33:27.298 --> 00:33:30.927
It must have its pleasures.

685
00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:32.679
Hmm.

686
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:36.725
"No profit grows where
is no pleasure taken."

687
00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:38.393
Shakespeare.

688
00:33:38.435 --> 00:33:41.062
Taming of the Shrew.

689
00:33:42.814 --> 00:33:46.359
Bring us a bottle of Cabernet
Sauvignon. The Heitz. 2014.

690
00:33:50.655 --> 00:33:55.535
So... what other surprises
do you have in store for me?

691
00:34:07.839 --> 00:34:09.215
Hello.

692
00:34:09.257 --> 00:34:11.301
- Oh.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

693
00:34:11.343 --> 00:34:13.511
Sorry. Thanks.

694
00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:18.933
So. how did it go
with Kevin Hamilton?

695
00:34:18.975 --> 00:34:20.769
Fine.

696
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.938
Turns out he's
quite fond of Mary Aston.

697
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.648
Yes. I knew it.

698
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.400
They've known each other
since they were teenagers.

699
00:34:27.442 --> 00:34:29.027
before she met Mark Aston.

700
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:30.653
They used to dance together.

701
00:34:30.695 --> 00:34:33.615
and his eyes totally light up
when he talks about her.

702
00:34:33.656 --> 00:34:35.992
and turns out that
she's actually responsible

703
00:34:36.034 --> 00:34:37.494
for getting him this job.

704
00:34:37.535 --> 00:34:40.455
Like. his life kind
of revolves around her.

705
00:34:40.497 --> 00:34:41.998
Oh. Who would have thought?

706
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.876
Okay. Rockford. don't get smug.
It doesn't suit you.

707
00:34:46.378 --> 00:34:48.588
What did you find out
from Mary Aston?

708
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.841
Well. she reminds me of a
casting director I once knew.

709
00:34:51.883 --> 00:34:56.012
Yes. a woman driven
by the pursuit of pleasure.

710
00:34:56.054 --> 00:34:58.682
I think she does what
she wants when she wants.

711
00:34:58.723 --> 00:34:59.933
Really?

712
00:34:59.974 --> 00:35:01.810
Yes. it might have
been Mark Aston's company.

713
00:35:01.851 --> 00:35:03.520
but I get the distinct
impression

714
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:05.772
that Mary was
the power behind the throne.

715
00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:09.317
I'm not too sure the two of them
are so close anymore. though.

716
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:10.527
And how do you know that?

717
00:35:10.568 --> 00:35:12.946
Well. she may have said

718
00:35:12.987 --> 00:35:14.948
that she'd welcome
a private dance lesson.

719
00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:16.700
Did she make a pass at you?

720
00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:18.243
Are you jealous?

721
00:35:18.284 --> 00:35:20.912
No! No. of course not.

722
00:35:20.954 --> 00:35:25.333
It's just...
It's just principle. you know?

723
00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:26.710
You don't really
want someone

724
00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:28.503
making a pass at your husband.
even if it's your...

725
00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:30.630
- pretend undercover husband.
- Well. fear not.

726
00:35:30.672 --> 00:35:34.426
Your pretend undercover husband
was completely faithful.

727
00:35:34.467 --> 00:35:37.762
Although. I'm not so sure we can
say the same about Mary.

728
00:35:37.804 --> 00:35:39.723
But that doesn't
make her a killer.

729
00:35:39.764 --> 00:35:41.182
No. but there was
something she said

730
00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:44.352
about Mark working himself
and others into the ground.

731
00:35:44.394 --> 00:35:46.730
It was definitely
a bone of contention.

732
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:48.857
but I think she was referring to
something more specific.

733
00:35:48.898 --> 00:35:50.692
All right.
we'll see what Ana can dig up.

734
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:54.237
Right. I guess we'd better
go and get ready.

735
00:35:54.279 --> 00:35:56.322
- Hmm?
- The competition?

736
00:35:56.364 --> 00:35:59.242
We're dancing this evening.
You haven't forgotten. have you?

737
00:35:59.284 --> 00:36:00.827
No. I've tried to.

738
00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:04.581
I poked my head into the
ballroom earlier and...

739
00:36:04.622 --> 00:36:06.249
these people
are not messing around.

740
00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:07.709
Well. neither are we.

741
00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:09.502
Come on.

742
00:36:09.544 --> 00:36:11.421
You'll be good.

743
00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:13.256
I'll be great.

744
00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:15.592
Do you ever get worried?

745
00:36:15.633 --> 00:36:17.385
Not one there's nothing
to worry about.

746
00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:19.804
Come on. partner.

747
00:36:42.535 --> 00:36:44.079
Where did you get this dress?

748
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.413
It's from one of my shows.

749
00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:47.207
Well. I feel like
I should be. uh...

750
00:36:47.248 --> 00:36:48.917
on top of a wedding cake.

751
00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:51.419
You look marvelous.

752
00:36:52.837 --> 00:36:53.963
Okay...

753
00:36:54.005 --> 00:36:56.257
Just remember.
posture and smile.

754
00:36:56.299 --> 00:36:57.801
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

755
00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:03.139
(big band music playing)

756
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:06.059
Oh. boy.

757
00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:08.269
Seriously.
you do look wonderful.

758
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:09.771
Oh. thank you. Inspector Morse.

759
00:37:09.813 --> 00:37:13.024
but save the Brit charm
for the suspects.

760
00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:16.945
(big band music playing)

761
00:37:18.488 --> 00:37:20.281
Let's welcome our
competing couples.

762
00:37:20.323 --> 00:37:21.991
(audience applauding)

763
00:37:22.033 --> 00:37:23.702
- (applauding)
- Oh. Here we go.

764
00:37:23.743 --> 00:37:25.286
Wait.
What's happening right now?

765
00:37:25.328 --> 00:37:27.122
The presentational promenade.

766
00:37:27.163 --> 00:37:29.541
Just follow my lead and smile.

767
00:37:29.582 --> 00:37:32.168
You didn't say
anything about this part.

768
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.837
Hello.

769
00:37:35.463 --> 00:37:38.633
(audience applauding)

770
00:37:38.675 --> 00:37:40.343
- Oh. Stuart. Sally?
- Sebastian: Yes.

771
00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:41.720
Let me take you
over to the table.

772
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:43.304
- Thank you.
- Bailey: Thanks.

773
00:37:43.346 --> 00:37:45.724
Just this way.

774
00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:47.225
Just over here.

775
00:37:47.267 --> 00:37:48.685
- Thanks so much.
- You look lovely.

776
00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:51.021
- Thanks.
- Thank you. Barbara.

777
00:37:51.062 --> 00:37:55.191
- Darling.
- Honey.

778
00:37:55.233 --> 00:37:56.317
Barbara: You both look lovely.

779
00:37:56.359 --> 00:37:58.028
Sebastian: Thank you.

780
00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:02.782
Good luck tonight. everyone.

781
00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:06.619
Good evening.
So lovely to have a new couple.

782
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:08.663
I'm looking forward
to seeing you two dance.

783
00:38:08.705 --> 00:38:10.957
- Oh.
- (all chuckling)

784
00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:12.834
We might have some competition.

785
00:38:12.876 --> 00:38:15.337
Well. that's what
we're here for. Mary.

786
00:38:15.378 --> 00:38:18.298
And to have fun. Tom.

787
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.966
Are you dancing together?

788
00:38:20.008 --> 00:38:21.634
Well. neither of us had
a partner when we joined.

789
00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:23.345
so it's a practical
solution.

790
00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:25.597
And we also enjoy dancing
together. don't we?

791
00:38:25.638 --> 00:38:29.309
Yes. of course.
That goes without saying.

792
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:31.478
(all chuckling)

793
00:38:32.812 --> 00:38:35.523
I expect the two of you
make a dazzling duo.

794
00:38:35.565 --> 00:38:38.651
Looks. charm. and that accent.

795
00:38:38.693 --> 00:38:40.987
You really landed a good one.

796
00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:43.448
I did.

797
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.370
Welcome everyone.

798
00:38:48.411 --> 00:38:51.039
to our annual
Aston Company dance.

799
00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:55.835
where our senior executives
compete for fun. for friendship.

800
00:38:55.877 --> 00:38:58.213
and to better understand
the business we're in.

801
00:38:58.254 --> 00:38:59.506
one step at a time.

802
00:38:59.547 --> 00:39:00.674
(audience applauding)

803
00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:03.385
This year we are
in beautiful Malta.

804
00:39:03.426 --> 00:39:05.553
where you'll be dancing
in some of the country's

805
00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:09.974
most iconic locations to
better inspire your dances.

806
00:39:10.016 --> 00:39:13.895
And as always.
Kevin has done a wonderful job.

807
00:39:13.937 --> 00:39:17.357
(audience applauding)

808
00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:18.942
Kevin: Thank you very much.

809
00:39:18.983 --> 00:39:22.445
Once again. three judges
will be watching you dance -

810
00:39:22.487 --> 00:39:26.282
Mary. myself. and our new event
liaison Barbara Stone.

811
00:39:26.324 --> 00:39:28.326
(audience applauding)

812
00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:31.830
We'll be looking at a
combination of factors.

813
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:34.749
I'll be judging skill.
Mary - presentation

814
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:36.501
and Barbara -

815
00:39:36.543 --> 00:39:38.670
chemistry.
And who knows?

816
00:39:38.712 --> 00:39:41.881
Mary and I may even come and
join you on the dance floor.

817
00:39:41.923 --> 00:39:42.799
(audience cheering)

818
00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:45.051
Thank you. thank you. thank you.

819
00:39:45.093 --> 00:39:47.721
(audience applauding)

820
00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:52.142
Hi.

821
00:39:52.183 --> 00:39:54.602
Will you not
be dancing. Barbara?

822
00:39:54.644 --> 00:39:57.939
I didn't come here to dance.
I'll judge from afar.

823
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:02.736
So. Tom. are you now in line
to take over the company?

824
00:40:02.777 --> 00:40:07.282
Oh. I-I mean. that is up to
the board and Mary to decide.

825
00:40:07.323 --> 00:40:10.285
But it's a possibility.
as CFO.

826
00:40:10.326 --> 00:40:13.371
Although.
a relatively new CFO.

827
00:40:13.413 --> 00:40:15.081
Oh. what happened
to the former CFO?

828
00:40:15.123 --> 00:40:16.541
He died.

829
00:40:16.583 --> 00:40:18.293
Tom: I thought that was
before you arrived. Barbra.

830
00:40:18.335 --> 00:40:20.754
I heard about it.

831
00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:23.340
Cocktail time.

832
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:24.591
It's an hour
before the competition.

833
00:40:24.632 --> 00:40:26.343
they're serving cocktails
on the terrace.

834
00:40:26.384 --> 00:40:27.344
Would you like to join?

835
00:40:27.385 --> 00:40:28.928
Yeah?

836
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:30.013
Sure. yeah.

837
00:40:30.055 --> 00:40:31.014
We'll join you.

838
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.684
(Laughing)

839
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.064
So. when did the former CFO die?

840
00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:41.024
About a year ago. wasn't it?

841
00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:42.359
A heart attack. I think.

842
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.110
Oh. yes.

843
00:40:44.152 --> 00:40:46.529
He was close to retirement.
Days away. I think.

844
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:47.906
Oh. how unfortunate.

845
00:40:47.947 --> 00:40:49.949
Well. this place
can do that to you.

846
00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:53.203
Mark drives--
drove us all pretty hard.

847
00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:54.496
That's not unique
to this company.

848
00:40:54.537 --> 00:40:56.206
It's a very
competitive industry.

849
00:40:56.247 --> 00:40:59.834
True. but it doesn't hurt not
to take things too seriously.

850
00:40:59.876 --> 00:41:01.252
Don't let this one fool you.

851
00:41:01.294 --> 00:41:04.172
She's as competitive
and as ambitious as anyone.

852
00:41:04.214 --> 00:41:06.216
Tom. that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

853
00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:09.427
(both chuckling)

854
00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:12.472
Mary: Okay. everyone.
It's time to foxtrot!

855
00:41:12.514 --> 00:41:13.973
Shall we?

856
00:41:14.015 --> 00:41:14.933
I guess so.

857
00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:20.397
*

858
00:41:20.438 --> 00:41:22.065
Lovely.

859
00:41:22.107 --> 00:41:24.359
Just remember the rhythm.

860
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:26.403
And... That's it.

861
00:41:26.444 --> 00:41:28.113
You're doing great.
Don't think about it.

862
00:41:28.154 --> 00:41:30.824
It's all I can think about.

863
00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:34.369
I loved how you asked Tom if
he was in line for the top job.

864
00:41:34.411 --> 00:41:35.704
His face.

865
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:39.499
I think he's definitely
hiding something.

866
00:41:39.541 --> 00:41:41.793
That's it. Smile.

867
00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:43.378
So. are we making progress?

868
00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.964
Well. I'm starting to think no
one at our table can be trusted.

869
00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:47.090
Is that progress?

870
00:41:50.176 --> 00:41:52.721
Well. I understand
why Mary's a suspect.

871
00:41:52.762 --> 00:41:55.598
Loveless marriage.
drifted apart.

872
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.183
Kevin Hamilton might
be in love with her.

873
00:41:57.225 --> 00:41:58.476
so that puts him in the frame.

874
00:41:58.518 --> 00:42:01.688
Likewise. the nakedly
ambitious Tom Stevens.

875
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.566
But what is
Jennifer Tate's motivation?

876
00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:06.067
Bailey:
Maybe you can talk to Tom.

877
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:07.736
See if he'll reveal
anything about her.

878
00:42:07.777 --> 00:42:09.821
I can't tell if they like
or loathe each other.

879
00:42:09.863 --> 00:42:19.831
*

880
00:42:22.584 --> 00:42:23.835
(Clearing throat)

881
00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:27.964
(audience applauding)

882
00:42:29.924 --> 00:42:31.593
Nice job.

883
00:42:31.634 --> 00:42:32.844
Do you think we did enough?

884
00:42:32.886 --> 00:42:34.429
Are you kidding?
We're easily in the top half.

885
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:36.056
Top three. I reckon.

886
00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:37.307
I think we did okay.

887
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:38.975
Oh. someone's getting
a little competitive.

888
00:42:39.017 --> 00:42:40.477
No. it's called
maintaining cover.

889
00:42:40.518 --> 00:42:42.645
Oh. really? When was the last
time you had this much fun

890
00:42:42.687 --> 00:42:43.772
on a case?

891
00:42:43.813 --> 00:42:45.065
Okay. stop it. Crockett.

892
00:42:45.106 --> 00:42:46.608
We have work to do.

893
00:42:46.649 --> 00:42:48.735
I want Ana to look into the CFO.

894
00:42:48.777 --> 00:42:51.112
the former CFO. and see if
there's anything fishy there.

895
00:42:51.154 --> 00:42:53.031
and we need to speak with
the maid who discovered

896
00:42:53.073 --> 00:42:54.282
Mark Aston's body.

897
00:42:54.324 --> 00:42:56.743
Hm. Roger that. detective.

898
00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:02.290
Thank you.

899
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.795
Well done. you two.

900
00:43:06.836 --> 00:43:08.421
I knew you'd be
fun to watch.

901
00:43:08.463 --> 00:43:09.798
Careful. Mary.
we don't want to reveal

902
00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:11.883
the judges' thoughts quite yet.

903
00:43:11.925 --> 00:43:13.468
Oh. quite right.
Consider me silenced.

904
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.638
Well. as a judge of chemistry.
I can say it was crystal clear

905
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.641
that you are a very
happily married couple.

906
00:43:19.683 --> 00:43:21.226
Every time you
looked at each other.

907
00:43:21.267 --> 00:43:22.477
your faces just lit up.

908
00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:23.728
Oh.

909
00:43:26.147 --> 00:43:29.651
Um. I think I'm going to go to
the bar and get a proper drink.

910
00:43:29.693 --> 00:43:31.194
Anyone fancy joining me?

911
00:43:32.862 --> 00:43:36.574
I'd actually love to pick
Jennifer's brain about shoes.

912
00:43:36.616 --> 00:43:37.992
I think my heels
are just too high.

913
00:43:38.034 --> 00:43:40.870
I think I'll join you. Stuart.

914
00:43:40.912 --> 00:43:42.288
Great.

915
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:43.331
Okay.

916
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:46.334
My feet are killing me.

917
00:43:50.672 --> 00:43:52.757
I have to say. Tom.
I'm rather impressed with

918
00:43:52.799 --> 00:43:53.883
your dance skills.

919
00:43:53.925 --> 00:43:55.176
Oh. it's just pragmatism.

920
00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:56.678
People who dance.
they do better here.

921
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.846
So. I learned.

922
00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:02.183
Two whiskeys please.

923
00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:04.185
Thank you.

924
00:44:05.895 --> 00:44:08.857
Don't tell me you don't enjoy
the dancing. though. Tom.

925
00:44:08.898 --> 00:44:11.693
Well. I enjoy that
I work for a market leader.

926
00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:13.528
If the Aston's
made us play softball.

927
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.405
I would have gotten
good at softball.

928
00:44:15.447 --> 00:44:16.406
(Chuckling)

929
00:44:21.077 --> 00:44:23.580
You and Jennifer do make
a splendid dance couple though.

930
00:44:23.621 --> 00:44:24.873
Well. like I told you.

931
00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:27.125
Jennifer's just
as ambitious as I am.

932
00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:28.710
She must have
been upset. though.

933
00:44:28.752 --> 00:44:30.670
with the death of Mark Aston.

934
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:33.173
No. They weren't close.

935
00:44:33.214 --> 00:44:35.425
Actually.
she was frustrated with him.

936
00:44:35.467 --> 00:44:38.511
She'd been planning this
new global rebranding campaign

937
00:44:38.553 --> 00:44:43.141
for months. very high profile.
and mark. he wasn't keen.

938
00:44:43.183 --> 00:44:46.895
In fact.
he was stalling her career.

939
00:44:46.936 --> 00:44:49.105
And that's not
wise with Jennifer.

940
00:44:49.147 --> 00:44:50.106
(chuckling)

941
00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:56.738
Thanks for the advice.
I'm really not used to...

942
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.531
Well. I'm not
used to any of this.

943
00:44:58.573 --> 00:45:00.116
It's all a little strange.
isn't it?

944
00:45:00.158 --> 00:45:02.369
But every company
has its quirks.

945
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.745
You'll find your way.

946
00:45:03.787 --> 00:45:05.455
Oh. you and Tom seem to
have worked it all out.

947
00:45:06.956 --> 00:45:09.751
Can I be honest? I don't know
that he really likes me.

948
00:45:09.793 --> 00:45:11.336
Tom doesn't like anyone.

949
00:45:11.378 --> 00:45:14.047
he doesn't find it
an efficient use of time.

950
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:16.758
Hm. Do you think
he'll be the new boss?

951
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.095
Mm. Well. he wanted to be CFO
and that happened.

952
00:45:20.136 --> 00:45:22.639
and now he wants
to be in charge.

953
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:25.600
and there's
an opening. so.

954
00:45:25.642 --> 00:45:28.186
Mm. this was
just delicious.

955
00:45:28.228 --> 00:45:29.187
(chuckling)

956
00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:31.147
(music ending)

957
00:45:36.194 --> 00:45:44.244
*

958
00:45:44.285 --> 00:45:46.955
Congratulations to
our wonderful executives.

959
00:45:46.996 --> 00:45:50.250
Your passion for our business
shows itself on the dance floor.

960
00:45:50.291 --> 00:45:52.293
(audience applauding)

961
00:45:52.335 --> 00:45:54.170
Thank you to our
last year's champions.

962
00:45:54.212 --> 00:45:55.422
Steven and Andrea.

963
00:45:55.463 --> 00:45:57.173
You have been
an inspiration to us all.

964
00:45:57.215 --> 00:45:58.717
Thank you.

965
00:45:58.758 --> 00:46:03.680
(all applauding)

966
00:46:08.601 --> 00:46:11.521
Now let's find out the six
couples who made the final!

967
00:46:11.563 --> 00:46:14.983
They are Michael and Claire.

968
00:46:17.277 --> 00:46:18.361
Jeffrey and Rebecca.

969
00:46:18.403 --> 00:46:21.114
Christian and Brenda.

970
00:46:21.156 --> 00:46:23.366
Tom and Jennifer.

971
00:46:23.408 --> 00:46:25.285
James and Simone.

972
00:46:25.326 --> 00:46:26.661
Oh. no.
There's only one spot left.

973
00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:28.455
Wait for it.

974
00:46:28.496 --> 00:46:31.833
And finally.
our newest arrivals.

975
00:46:31.875 --> 00:46:33.835
Stuart and Sally.

976
00:46:33.877 --> 00:46:35.920
Let's give all of them
a round of applause.

977
00:46:35.962 --> 00:46:39.841
(audience applauding. cheering)

978
00:46:41.343 --> 00:46:43.803
And round two will be the tango.

979
00:46:43.845 --> 00:46:47.265
- (cheering. applauding)
- (chuckling)

980
00:46:47.307 --> 00:46:50.560
Congratulations. you two.

981
00:46:50.602 --> 00:46:53.146
Now things get serious.

982
00:46:53.188 --> 00:46:55.982
Challenge accepted.

983
00:46:56.024 --> 00:46:58.109
Yes. Bring it on.

984
00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:00.153
(glasses clinking)

985
00:47:00.195 --> 00:47:08.161
*

986
00:47:08.203 --> 00:47:09.329
(knocking)

987
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:11.664
Housekeeping: Breakfast!

988
00:47:11.706 --> 00:47:12.707
Alright.

989
00:47:14.542 --> 00:47:16.670
Uh. one moment. please!

990
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:18.254
(whispering)
Seb-- Sebastian!

991
00:47:18.296 --> 00:47:21.216
(grunting)

992
00:47:21.257 --> 00:47:22.967
Come here. Here. Come on.

993
00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:30.684
Housekeeping: Good morning.

994
00:47:30.725 --> 00:47:31.726
Hello.

995
00:47:31.768 --> 00:47:37.232
*

996
00:47:37.273 --> 00:47:38.817
I feel like I ran a marathon.

997
00:47:38.858 --> 00:47:40.735
Well. you use a lot of muscles
dancing that you're not used to.

998
00:47:40.777 --> 00:47:41.903
There's bound to be a reaction.

999
00:47:41.945 --> 00:47:43.071
Makes sense.

1000
00:47:43.113 --> 00:47:44.197
And then there
was the champagne.

1001
00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:45.657
I had one glass.
maybe two.

1002
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:49.744
Ooh. that is bright.

1003
00:47:51.955 --> 00:47:53.623
Shall I pour coffee?

1004
00:47:53.665 --> 00:47:56.209
Oh. no. We'll manage.
Thank you.

1005
00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:58.545
Wow.
What a wild few days. huh?

1006
00:47:58.586 --> 00:48:01.631
Oh. I know. So crazy.

1007
00:48:01.673 --> 00:48:04.467
Yes.
Oh. we heard about Mr. Aston.

1008
00:48:04.509 --> 00:48:07.595
Now. we were told that
a maid discovered the body.

1009
00:48:07.637 --> 00:48:09.639
It wasn't you. was it?

1010
00:48:09.681 --> 00:48:12.809
Imagine! No. no.
It was poor Judy Maxwell.

1011
00:48:13.768 --> 00:48:16.021
On her second day. poor thing.

1012
00:48:18.106 --> 00:48:19.566
I don't think she'll stay.

1013
00:48:19.607 --> 00:48:21.735
So. the last person
to see Aston alive

1014
00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:23.903
started just the day before?

1015
00:48:23.945 --> 00:48:25.655
Really?

1016
00:48:25.697 --> 00:48:29.492
Ana: (knocking)
Hello. Are you decent?

1017
00:48:29.534 --> 00:48:31.411
- Oh.
- Oh. hey.

1018
00:48:31.453 --> 00:48:34.080
Oh. uh... How was your dance?

1019
00:48:34.122 --> 00:48:36.082
Oh. we survived.

1020
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:39.627
How's the research?

1021
00:48:39.669 --> 00:48:42.547
Oh. good.
I have a lot of information.

1022
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:43.673
Do you have a suspect?

1023
00:48:43.715 --> 00:48:45.925
Too many.
Let's have some coffee.

1024
00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:51.473
(sighing)

1025
00:48:54.517 --> 00:48:55.477
How are you. Ana?

1026
00:48:55.518 --> 00:48:56.811
I'm good. thank you.

1027
00:48:56.853 --> 00:48:57.771
How are you?

1028
00:48:57.812 --> 00:48:59.272
Oh. very good.

1029
00:48:59.314 --> 00:49:02.108
Very impressed
with this one's skills.

1030
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.277
On the dance floor.

1031
00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:05.653
Ah.

1032
00:49:05.695 --> 00:49:08.198
Um. I think I'll go
and take a shower.

1033
00:49:08.239 --> 00:49:09.324
unless the two of you need me.

1034
00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:10.742
No. I think we got it from here.

1035
00:49:14.412 --> 00:49:16.039
Looks like I found you
a good partner.

1036
00:49:16.081 --> 00:49:19.292
He's a nightmare.
He thinks he's Sherlock Holmes.

1037
00:49:19.334 --> 00:49:20.669
So. who do you
want me to look at?

1038
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.462
Alright. from these
background checks.

1039
00:49:22.504 --> 00:49:24.714
I want you to
focus on Mary Aston.

1040
00:49:24.756 --> 00:49:27.550
Tom Stevens. Kevin Hamilton.

1041
00:49:27.592 --> 00:49:29.469
and Jennifer Tate.

1042
00:49:29.511 --> 00:49:31.471
Oh. and there's a maid here.
Judy Maxwell.

1043
00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:33.473
Do a check on her.
Anything you can find.

1044
00:49:33.515 --> 00:49:34.641
I understand.

1045
00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:36.768
Oh. and then lastly.
will you look into

1046
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.812
the former CFO of the company?

1047
00:49:38.853 --> 00:49:39.729
What's his name?

1048
00:49:39.771 --> 00:49:41.648
I don't know. but he was CFO

1049
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.483
up until his death last year.

1050
00:49:43.525 --> 00:49:45.360
Just dig up
anything you can find.

1051
00:49:45.402 --> 00:49:47.404
including how he died.

1052
00:49:47.445 --> 00:49:56.830
*

1053
00:49:56.871 --> 00:49:59.082
You know.
we could cycle on the beach.

1054
00:49:59.124 --> 00:50:00.917
There's a bike path.

1055
00:50:00.959 --> 00:50:03.670
Too much sun.
too much breeze. people.

1056
00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:04.963
It's a more efficient pace here.

1057
00:50:05.005 --> 00:50:08.174
Well. a little inefficiency
isn't always bad.

1058
00:50:08.216 --> 00:50:09.217
Maybe not for you.

1059
00:50:11.803 --> 00:50:15.015
Stuart and Sally were
quite good. weren't they?

1060
00:50:15.056 --> 00:50:16.808
He carried her.

1061
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.351
They worked well together.

1062
00:50:18.393 --> 00:50:20.520
They're not gonna win it. if
that's what you're suggesting.

1063
00:50:20.562 --> 00:50:23.398
I just think they
coordinated well.

1064
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.025
What are you getting at?

1065
00:50:25.066 --> 00:50:28.194
When you were at
the bar with Stuart.

1066
00:50:28.236 --> 00:50:29.571
what did you talk about?

1067
00:50:29.612 --> 00:50:32.657
I don't know.
The competition. the company.

1068
00:50:32.699 --> 00:50:34.534
He asked about you.

1069
00:50:34.576 --> 00:50:36.995
And I'm sure
you said nice things.

1070
00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:39.247
She asked about you.

1071
00:50:39.289 --> 00:50:40.623
Asked what?

1072
00:50:40.665 --> 00:50:42.417
How you got the CFO role.

1073
00:50:42.459 --> 00:50:44.044
Really?

1074
00:50:44.085 --> 00:50:45.754
Mm-hm.

1075
00:50:45.795 --> 00:50:47.047
They're a lovely couple.

1076
00:50:47.088 --> 00:50:49.466
but they do ask
a lot of questions.

1077
00:50:49.507 --> 00:50:53.219
You wouldn't want to be
hiding any big secrets.

1078
00:50:56.431 --> 00:50:57.349
I'm going to go shower.

1079
00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:00.727
Okay. see you later.

1080
00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:10.570
*

1081
00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:12.655
Excuse me. is there
any way we could have

1082
00:51:12.697 --> 00:51:13.907
a word with Judy Maxwell?

1083
00:51:13.948 --> 00:51:14.908
Judy.

1084
00:51:14.949 --> 00:51:16.284
Yes.

1085
00:51:16.326 --> 00:51:17.452
She's on the breakfast patio.

1086
00:51:17.494 --> 00:51:18.578
cleaning up after
the morning rush.

1087
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.246
I can call her for you.

1088
00:51:20.288 --> 00:51:23.291
Oh. no. That's okay.
We're actually headed that way.

1089
00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:24.793
Is everything okay?

1090
00:51:25.877 --> 00:51:27.253
Oh. yes. yes. yes.
I just wanted--

1091
00:51:27.295 --> 00:51:29.547
wanted to thank her for
a restaurant she recommended.

1092
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:31.216
Very well. Madam.

1093
00:51:31.257 --> 00:51:32.258
Thanks.

1094
00:51:33.593 --> 00:51:35.303
You lie very well.

1095
00:51:35.345 --> 00:51:38.598
You are a constant delight.

1096
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.974
Oh. I see what you did there.

1097
00:51:40.016 --> 00:51:41.976
Maybe I should be an actor.
How hard could it be?

1098
00:51:47.399 --> 00:51:50.151
I think that might be her.

1099
00:51:50.193 --> 00:51:53.029
Here. Put these on.

1100
00:51:53.071 --> 00:51:54.239
Why?

1101
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.157
You'll see. Mr. Actor.
We're collaborating.

1102
00:52:00.161 --> 00:52:02.580
Um. excuse me. Judy?

1103
00:52:02.622 --> 00:52:04.332
Yes. Madam. Can I help you?

1104
00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:05.458
Actually.
I think we can help you.

1105
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.335
I'm sorry?

1106
00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:09.379
My husband here
is a psychiatrist.

1107
00:52:09.421 --> 00:52:10.380
He is?

1108
00:52:10.422 --> 00:52:11.673
I am.

1109
00:52:11.715 --> 00:52:13.925
Mm. and when we heard
about your whole ordeal.

1110
00:52:13.967 --> 00:52:15.176
I mean. discovering a dead body.

1111
00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:17.053
he thought you might
need to talk to someone.

1112
00:52:17.095 --> 00:52:21.349
Yes. and discovering a body
can be rather traumatic.

1113
00:52:21.391 --> 00:52:23.768
I'm fine. Thank you.

1114
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.229
Are you sure?

1115
00:52:26.271 --> 00:52:28.982
We often find that
shock isn't immediate.

1116
00:52:29.024 --> 00:52:31.026
It takes the brain
a day or two to process.

1117
00:52:31.067 --> 00:52:35.071
Why don't you tell me.
in your own words.

1118
00:52:35.113 --> 00:52:36.489
what happened?

1119
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:38.658
You may find that it's helpful.

1120
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.160
Oh. honey.
You have helped so many people.

1121
00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:42.662
If I were you.
I would talk to him.

1122
00:52:42.704 --> 00:52:44.581
Look. I'm fine.

1123
00:52:44.622 --> 00:52:46.833
I just went to the suite
to do turn-down service.

1124
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:49.294
The guy asked me
for some towels.

1125
00:52:49.336 --> 00:52:50.837
then he must have keeled over.

1126
00:52:50.879 --> 00:52:52.088
Wait. so you didn't
see him fall?

1127
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.966
No. I was in
another room tidying.

1128
00:52:55.008 --> 00:52:57.802
I thought turn-down service
was just getting the bed ready.

1129
00:52:57.844 --> 00:52:59.137
What is this?

1130
00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:00.847
No. no. no. It's good to
focus on the details.

1131
00:53:00.889 --> 00:53:04.059
You see. that's how we get
to the root of any trauma.

1132
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.561
I'm not traumatized. Thank you.

1133
00:53:06.603 --> 00:53:09.022
I just want to
get on with my work.

1134
00:53:09.064 --> 00:53:11.816
Well. I'm here if
you feel differently.

1135
00:53:15.236 --> 00:53:18.281
(sighing)
Well. she didn't want to talk.

1136
00:53:18.323 --> 00:53:19.657
No.

1137
00:53:19.699 --> 00:53:21.618
Add her to the list of suspects?

1138
00:53:21.659 --> 00:53:24.204
Yeah. why not?
Everyone else is on the list.

1139
00:53:24.245 --> 00:53:26.456
*

1140
00:53:26.498 --> 00:53:30.293
It's me. I know you wanted me
to stay on. but I'm leaving.

1141
00:53:30.335 --> 00:53:32.170
No. I don't care.
I got you the papers.

1142
00:53:32.212 --> 00:53:34.255
That was the job.
I didn't sign up

1143
00:53:34.297 --> 00:53:35.882
to trip over dead bodies.

1144
00:53:35.924 --> 00:53:38.134
I'm being psychoanalyzed
by the guests.

1145
00:53:38.176 --> 00:53:39.094
Enough is enough.

1146
00:53:40.929 --> 00:53:42.806
I don't know.
some doctor and his nosy wife

1147
00:53:42.847 --> 00:53:44.265
started asking me questions.

1148
00:53:44.307 --> 00:53:47.227
He was tall. dark hair.
English accent.

1149
00:53:47.268 --> 00:53:50.480
She was-- Yes. English.
She was American.

1150
00:53:50.522 --> 00:53:51.815
Kind of blunt.

1151
00:53:51.856 --> 00:53:53.066
(line going dead)

1152
00:53:53.108 --> 00:53:55.026
Hello? Hello!

1153
00:53:55.068 --> 00:54:05.036
*

1154
00:54:09.457 --> 00:54:11.042
So. the tango. huh?

1155
00:54:11.084 --> 00:54:13.378
Oh. don't worry.
There's nothing to it.

1156
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.255
It's called the walking dance.

1157
00:54:15.296 --> 00:54:19.759
Ah. it's basically
walking with attitude.

1158
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:20.802
and you can do that.
I've seen you.

1159
00:54:20.844 --> 00:54:21.886
(chuckling)

1160
00:54:21.928 --> 00:54:23.430
You know what. Mr. Fancy Pants?

1161
00:54:23.471 --> 00:54:24.431
I have a question for you.

1162
00:54:24.472 --> 00:54:25.765
Mm-hm?

1163
00:54:25.807 --> 00:54:27.142
Why is it that
you're travelling

1164
00:54:27.183 --> 00:54:31.396
all over the world
teaching dance to old people?

1165
00:54:31.438 --> 00:54:34.357
And cranky detectives?

1166
00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:37.277
Well. I guess. I don't know.

1167
00:54:37.318 --> 00:54:41.114
When you achieve and certain
amount of fame and success.

1168
00:54:41.156 --> 00:54:45.618
it's very easy to get
caught up in. I don't know.

1169
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.870
things that don't matter.

1170
00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:52.500
See. when I was young I spent
a lot of time with my Aunt Vera.

1171
00:54:52.542 --> 00:54:54.044
She basically brought me up.

1172
00:54:54.085 --> 00:54:56.463
She is the one
who taught me to dance.

1173
00:54:56.504 --> 00:54:58.131
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1174
00:54:58.173 --> 00:55:00.675
We used to have
this dressing up box.

1175
00:55:00.717 --> 00:55:04.471
and every day I would--
I would jump in

1176
00:55:04.512 --> 00:55:05.972
and throw on a costume

1177
00:55:06.014 --> 00:55:07.432
and I would
become that character

1178
00:55:07.474 --> 00:55:08.975
until the sun went down.

1179
00:55:09.017 --> 00:55:10.018
Sounds like fun.

1180
00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.436
It was.

1181
00:55:11.478 --> 00:55:14.981
And a few years ago.
my Aunt Vera got very sick.

1182
00:55:15.023 --> 00:55:18.026
I was scared I was
going to lose her.

1183
00:55:18.068 --> 00:55:20.528
but she pulled through.

1184
00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:23.698
When she did. I realized that

1185
00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.076
I don't want to
spend any more time

1186
00:55:26.117 --> 00:55:27.577
on things that don't matter.

1187
00:55:28.995 --> 00:55:30.121
So. I asked her.

1188
00:55:31.873 --> 00:55:35.418
How do I know
what I should be doing?

1189
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.253
And what did she say?

1190
00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:38.922
She said. "If it's not
helping someone else.

1191
00:55:38.963 --> 00:55:40.715
then why are you doing it?

1192
00:55:40.757 --> 00:55:43.093
Well. she sounds like
a very smart woman.

1193
00:55:43.134 --> 00:55:46.137
She is. So now. whenever I can.
I enjoy helping people.

1194
00:55:46.179 --> 00:55:48.723
young or old.
Teach them to dance.

1195
00:55:48.765 --> 00:55:51.309
move. laugh.
play well with others.

1196
00:55:51.351 --> 00:55:53.353
all the while
utilizing my astonishing

1197
00:55:53.395 --> 00:55:54.646
crime-solving skills.

1198
00:55:56.064 --> 00:56:00.985
Anyway. enough investigating me.
Detective.

1199
00:56:01.986 --> 00:56:03.363
It's time for us to tango.

1200
00:56:10.787 --> 00:56:11.996
Ready?

1201
00:56:12.038 --> 00:56:14.833
(water sloshing)

1202
00:56:14.874 --> 00:56:16.126
Why are we in the water?

1203
00:56:16.167 --> 00:56:17.669
Because I want you to
forget about your feet.

1204
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:21.131
I need my feet.

1205
00:56:21.172 --> 00:56:23.174
I want your feet
to slide and glide

1206
00:56:23.216 --> 00:56:25.635
so that we can concentrate
on the connection

1207
00:56:25.677 --> 00:56:27.554
of the upper body. okay?

1208
00:56:27.595 --> 00:56:29.931
And-- No. See?

1209
00:56:29.973 --> 00:56:31.599
Resist me.

1210
00:56:31.641 --> 00:56:34.978
Yes. Why did I ever think
that that would be a problem?

1211
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.188
Ready? And splash.

1212
00:56:39.649 --> 00:56:40.567
Oh. Not me.

1213
00:56:40.608 --> 00:56:42.652
Oh. sorry.

1214
00:56:42.694 --> 00:56:43.820
And...

1215
00:56:43.862 --> 00:56:49.451
*

1216
00:56:49.492 --> 00:56:52.579
So. this is the most
important thing to the tango.

1217
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.539
This is what I call
"central connection."

1218
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.916
We cannot dance without this.

1219
00:56:56.958 --> 00:57:00.003
Now. if you lean back.
I lean back.

1220
00:57:00.045 --> 00:57:02.756
You lean. I lean.

1221
00:57:02.797 --> 00:57:05.759
You lean.
and we never lose connection.

1222
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.011
Trust me. I anticipate you.

1223
00:57:08.053 --> 00:57:10.013
I trust you. You anticipate me--

1224
00:57:10.055 --> 00:57:11.056
Oh. I get it.

1225
00:57:11.097 --> 00:57:12.766
Oh. no! Don't let go! No. no!

1226
00:57:12.807 --> 00:57:16.144
(splashing)

1227
00:57:16.186 --> 00:57:17.187
Sorry! I'm so sorry!

1228
00:57:17.228 --> 00:57:18.688
You broke
the central connection.

1229
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:20.648
I-- I understand that.
I'm so sorry.

1230
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:24.027
I am so sorry.
Here. just let me help you up.

1231
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:25.070
- (grunting)
- (laughing)

1232
00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:26.363
I'm so sorry.

1233
00:57:26.404 --> 00:57:27.781
You did that on purpose.
didn't you?

1234
00:57:27.822 --> 00:57:29.324
- I did not. I really didn't.
- Yes. you did.

1235
00:57:29.366 --> 00:57:30.825
I wish I could say I did.
but I--

1236
00:57:30.867 --> 00:57:33.953
(laughing)

1237
00:57:33.995 --> 00:57:34.954
There you go.

1238
00:57:37.165 --> 00:57:38.541
- Ready?
- Yes.

1239
00:57:38.583 --> 00:57:39.584
And...

1240
00:57:41.419 --> 00:57:47.217
*

1241
00:57:47.258 --> 00:57:48.385
There you go.

1242
00:57:50.512 --> 00:57:51.763
- Hop. I did it.
- (laughing)

1243
00:57:54.265 --> 00:57:55.350
(chuckling)
I'm so sorry.

1244
00:57:55.392 --> 00:57:57.644
That's it. and here.

1245
00:57:57.686 --> 00:57:58.645
And.

1246
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:12.367
*

1247
00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:24.713
You good?

1248
00:58:24.754 --> 00:58:26.548
Yeah. That was good.

1249
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:27.549
Great.

1250
00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:28.550
Alright.

1251
00:58:30.301 --> 00:58:34.097
(both laughing)

1252
00:58:34.139 --> 00:58:35.223
Hah!

1253
00:58:35.265 --> 00:58:36.808
Okay. okay. Lesson's over.

1254
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.226
(laughing)

1255
00:58:38.268 --> 00:58:39.686
Oh. Mr. Fancy Pants.

1256
00:58:40.979 --> 00:58:48.987
*

1257
00:58:56.703 --> 00:58:59.372
I saw Sally and Stuart earlier.

1258
00:58:59.414 --> 00:59:00.957
What do you make of them?

1259
00:59:00.999 --> 00:59:02.375
Hm.

1260
00:59:02.417 --> 00:59:06.296
She asks a lot of questions.
Must be ambitious.

1261
00:59:06.338 --> 00:59:07.589
He's a good dancer.

1262
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:08.965
But he asks
a lot of questions. too.

1263
00:59:09.007 --> 00:59:10.342
He does?

1264
00:59:10.383 --> 00:59:13.094
Mm-hm. He came to see me
a couple of days ago.

1265
00:59:13.136 --> 00:59:14.763
He's very charming.

1266
00:59:14.804 --> 00:59:16.473
Mm.

1267
00:59:16.514 --> 00:59:18.308
Mark would have liked him.

1268
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:21.644
You know I almost miss him.

1269
00:59:21.686 --> 00:59:23.313
No. you don't.

1270
00:59:23.355 --> 00:59:25.565
Does that make me a bad person?

1271
00:59:25.607 --> 00:59:26.858
No!

1272
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.069
He wasn't a very nice man.

1273
00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.653
and he didn't make you happy.

1274
00:59:30.695 --> 00:59:33.156
He did make me
very rich. though.

1275
00:59:33.198 --> 00:59:34.199
Us.

1276
00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.367
He made us rich.

1277
00:59:35.408 --> 00:59:39.204
Not yet. darling.

1278
00:59:39.245 --> 00:59:40.663
You still have
one last thing to do

1279
00:59:40.705 --> 00:59:42.290
to complete your
part of the deal.

1280
00:59:42.332 --> 00:59:44.209
It's all in place.

1281
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:53.677
*

1282
00:59:53.718 --> 00:59:55.261
Are you sure you
know where we're going?

1283
00:59:55.303 --> 00:59:56.930
Trust me. it's the best
coffee on the island.

1284
00:59:56.971 --> 00:59:57.889
It's just down there.

1285
00:59:57.931 --> 00:59:58.890
(tires squealing)

1286
00:59:58.932 --> 00:59:59.974
Look out!

1287
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.063
CBU 89-- 896. 8--

1288
01:00:06.272 --> 01:00:08.608
So. you're okay then?

1289
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.151
Yes. I'm fine.
thank you.

1290
01:00:10.193 --> 01:00:11.736
I think I may have
landed on my hand.

1291
01:00:12.987 --> 01:00:14.197
Oh. Ow. Ooh.

1292
01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:15.365
Are you okay?

1293
01:00:15.407 --> 01:00:17.826
No. I think I. uh.
twisted my ankle.

1294
01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:19.703
Well. come on. Hopalong.
I got you.

1295
01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:21.996
Okay.

1296
01:00:22.038 --> 01:00:23.164
I need some ice on it.

1297
01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:24.791
Yeah. ice will help.

1298
01:00:30.755 --> 01:00:33.049
Could I get some ice
sent up to the room. please?

1299
01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:34.134
Definitely. sir.
Are you okay?

1300
01:00:34.175 --> 01:00:35.677
Oh. yes. No. I'm fine.

1301
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:38.346
Just-- Just a--
Just a minor mishap.

1302
01:00:38.388 --> 01:00:41.933
Okay. Well. someone left
a message for you.

1303
01:00:46.646 --> 01:00:49.024
*

1304
01:00:49.065 --> 01:00:51.151
Do you know who left this?

1305
01:00:51.192 --> 01:00:52.318
I'm sorry. no.

1306
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.571
It was placed on the desk.
I believe.

1307
01:00:54.612 --> 01:00:56.781
presumably by
one of the other guests.

1308
01:00:56.823 --> 01:00:58.074
Thank you.

1309
01:00:58.116 --> 01:00:59.242
You're welcome.

1310
01:00:59.284 --> 01:01:01.119
Look at this.

1311
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:04.831
"Stop asking questions.
You just had your one warning."

1312
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.376
You seem a little
happy for someone

1313
01:01:08.418 --> 01:01:09.794
who's just been run over.

1314
01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:11.921
Yeah. don't you see?
We've got someone rattled.

1315
01:01:11.963 --> 01:01:13.757
I mean. attacking us
is an admission of guilt.

1316
01:01:13.798 --> 01:01:15.925
It's confirmation that
a crime is being covered up.

1317
01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:19.804
(phone vibrating)

1318
01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:20.972
It's Ana.

1319
01:01:21.014 --> 01:01:22.599
(phone vibrating)

1320
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.060
I have some information for you.

1321
01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:26.936
Okay. great. but first I need
you to check out a plate.

1322
01:01:26.978 --> 01:01:27.937
You ready?

1323
01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:28.980
Mm-hm.

1324
01:01:29.022 --> 01:01:29.981
Charlie. Bravo. Uniform.

1325
01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:31.775
8-9-6.

1326
01:01:31.816 --> 01:01:32.942
Maybe 8-9-8.

1327
01:01:32.984 --> 01:01:35.403
It was moving fast.
It's a Mini Cooper.

1328
01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:37.280
It's a rental car.

1329
01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:39.657
Booked under the Aston
corporate account.

1330
01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:41.034
Do you have a name?

1331
01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:44.788
No. and we can't get
bank details before Monday.

1332
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:46.706
(groaning)
Alright. what else you got?

1333
01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:49.876
Kevin Hamilton
and the widow Mary

1334
01:01:49.918 --> 01:01:51.294
were once engaged.

1335
01:01:51.336 --> 01:01:52.671
Yup. called it.

1336
01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:53.672
You did?

1337
01:01:53.713 --> 01:01:54.589
Mm-hm.

1338
01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:55.548
Don't encourage him.

1339
01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:56.800
Well. he's right.

1340
01:01:56.841 --> 01:01:58.927
And he left to go travelling.

1341
01:01:58.968 --> 01:02:02.055
A year later.
she married Mark Aston.

1342
01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:05.225
So. Mary was always
in love with Kevin.

1343
01:02:05.266 --> 01:02:06.976
What about Judy Maxwell?

1344
01:02:07.018 --> 01:02:08.853
Not yet. Later today.

1345
01:02:08.895 --> 01:02:11.648
and details about
the lost CFO. too.

1346
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.651
but I do have something
on Jennifer Tate.

1347
01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:17.487
She's well-regarded
in her field.

1348
01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:21.324
but she left her
last job very suddenly.

1349
01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:23.827
Well. that's interesting.

1350
01:02:23.868 --> 01:02:27.789
And nobody had anything nice
to say about Tom Stevens.

1351
01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:30.083
Yeah. well.
that's not surprising.

1352
01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:32.085
Ana: Yeah. but this is.

1353
01:02:32.127 --> 01:02:35.338
He knew Kevin Hamilton before
he joined Aston International.

1354
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.965
Wait. what?

1355
01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:40.093
Yup. They both are listed as
directors in a shell company

1356
01:02:40.135 --> 01:02:44.639
called Madison Holdings
that formed several months

1357
01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:45.890
before he joined Aston.

1358
01:02:45.932 --> 01:02:48.059
So. Tom Stevens
and Kevin Hamilton

1359
01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:49.352
are working together? Ow.

1360
01:02:49.394 --> 01:02:50.645
Are you okay?

1361
01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:53.106
No. I'm fine. It's nothing.

1362
01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:55.358
Call us back when
you have the other details.

1363
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.693
Okay.

1364
01:02:56.735 --> 01:02:59.779
Okay. let's get you
back to the room.

1365
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:00.947
- No.
- Ah. ah. ah. ah.

1366
01:03:00.989 --> 01:03:04.200
Dancers need rest.
especially injured ones.

1367
01:03:04.242 --> 01:03:05.285
- (groaning)
- Come on.

1368
01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:19.257
*

1369
01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:21.301
Okay. I'm going to take a bath

1370
01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:23.345
and ice my foot.
get the swelling out.

1371
01:03:23.386 --> 01:03:25.597
-and you are going to rest.
-Oh. no. no. no.

1372
01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:27.432
There's no way I can sleep
right now. My mind is racing.

1373
01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.268
Just sit down
and put your feet up.

1374
01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:31.686
Just think of it as preparation

1375
01:03:31.728 --> 01:03:33.021
for the dance
competition tonight.

1376
01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:37.275
Here. Put the TV on.

1377
01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:38.610
Fine.

1378
01:03:38.651 --> 01:03:39.611
Fine. fine. fine.

1379
01:03:43.656 --> 01:03:44.616
(sighing)

1380
01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:46.368
Man #1: America. I am so--

1381
01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:51.122
Man #2: I know what you think.
You think I'm vain.

1382
01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:53.375
You think I'm shallow.
but just look again. darling.

1383
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.085
There's more to me
than meets the eye.

1384
01:03:55.126 --> 01:03:57.003
You know it's true.

1385
01:03:57.045 --> 01:03:58.713
Woman on TV: I don't know
what to think anymore.

1386
01:03:58.755 --> 01:04:01.591
This case has got me
upside down and turned around.

1387
01:04:02.717 --> 01:04:04.469
Man:
Just play the odds. darling.

1388
01:04:04.511 --> 01:04:06.930
It always comes down
to the same three things.

1389
01:04:06.971 --> 01:04:08.890
Woman: Oh. I know that.

1390
01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.351
But why don't you show me
and spell it out?

1391
01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:16.981
Power. Passion. Revenge.

1392
01:04:17.023 --> 01:04:18.858
The three things
that make a killer.

1393
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.111
Power. that fits
two of them for sure.

1394
01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:23.863
Passion. well. that puts
a different pair in frame.

1395
01:04:23.905 --> 01:04:26.783
But revenge? I don't know.

1396
01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:29.160
There's just something
I'm not seeing.

1397
01:04:29.202 --> 01:04:31.287
Hm. Perhaps we need to see this

1398
01:04:31.329 --> 01:04:33.289
from a different angle. darling.

1399
01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:39.170
*

1400
01:04:39.212 --> 01:04:41.172
How's your fancy footwork
going to help us now?

1401
01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:45.385
Well. it certainly can't hurt.

1402
01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:55.395
*

1403
01:05:17.834 --> 01:05:27.802
*

1404
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:51.284
(phone vibrating)

1405
01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:54.496
(phone vibrating)

1406
01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:55.747
Oh. uh...

1407
01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.334
(phone vibrating)

1408
01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:01.461
(clearing throat)
Ana. hi.

1409
01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:03.421
Ana:
I have details. Can we meet?

1410
01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:06.216
There's a cafe near
your hotel called Marla's.

1411
01:06:06.257 --> 01:06:08.301
We should sit at separate tables
so we're not seen together

1412
01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:10.512
by any hotel guests
who might go there.

1413
01:06:10.553 --> 01:06:12.305
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Of course.
We'll meet you there.

1414
01:06:17.435 --> 01:06:18.436
What?

1415
01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:19.896
Were you just
kissing your pillow?

1416
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.149
No. Weird.

1417
01:06:25.443 --> 01:06:35.412
*

1418
01:06:36.913 --> 01:06:38.248
What happened to you?

1419
01:06:38.289 --> 01:06:39.958
Oh. it's nothing.
Someone's just getting nervous.

1420
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.418
What do you got?

1421
01:06:41.459 --> 01:06:44.129
The CFO who died.
it doesn't look suspicious.

1422
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:46.381
His name was James Travertine.

1423
01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:49.259
He was 64.
a widower. one daughter.

1424
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.969
Do we know how he died?

1425
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:52.303
Heart attack.

1426
01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:54.639
And he was just one week
away from retirement.

1427
01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:56.683
Yes. we heard that.

1428
01:06:56.725 --> 01:06:58.435
He must have been
planning some adventures.

1429
01:06:58.476 --> 01:07:00.228
He'd just bought a boat. Look.

1430
01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:08.194
*

1431
01:07:08.236 --> 01:07:10.488
Funny Girl.

1432
01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:12.073
Oh. I love Funny Girl.

1433
01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:13.825
Didn't Streisand
win an Oscar for that?

1434
01:07:15.952 --> 01:07:17.787
Who's the girl? His daughter?

1435
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:20.707
I think so.
but that's not the big news.

1436
01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:22.459
I saved the best for last.

1437
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.003
The maid. Judy Maxwell.
she's a spy.

1438
01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:26.004
What?

1439
01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:27.547
I knew it.

1440
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:29.591
Yes. a spy.
Industrial espionage.

1441
01:07:29.632 --> 01:07:31.676
She works for a company
called Grey Circle.

1442
01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:33.845
They do corporate
and business research.

1443
01:07:33.887 --> 01:07:35.430
Do we know who hired them?

1444
01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:38.016
No. and they won't tell us
unless we get a warrant.

1445
01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:39.392
but that may take time.

1446
01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:43.063
Well. I guess we'll just
have to ask Judy Maxwell.

1447
01:07:43.104 --> 01:07:44.856
And we probably better hurry.

1448
01:07:44.898 --> 01:07:47.275
We don't know how much longer
she's going to be at the hotel.

1449
01:07:51.488 --> 01:07:53.990
Man: See. it's right there.
I told you it's right there.

1450
01:07:57.327 --> 01:07:59.037
Excuse me. I need to
speak with Judy Maxwell.

1451
01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:00.372
Oh. you just missed her.

1452
01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:02.123
She's already
finished for the day?

1453
01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:03.750
Uh. no.
She's leaving I'm afraid.

1454
01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:06.670
She decided the job
wasn't a good fit.

1455
01:08:06.711 --> 01:08:08.421
Do you know where
she is right now?

1456
01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:12.842
She was taking her bags to
the elevator for the car park

1457
01:08:12.884 --> 01:08:14.052
about two minutes ago.

1458
01:08:14.094 --> 01:08:15.261
Thank you.

1459
01:08:15.303 --> 01:08:17.180
Do you have ear phones
for your phone?

1460
01:08:17.222 --> 01:08:18.682
Yes. why?

1461
01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:20.642
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

1462
01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:22.936
The car park comes out on the
side street behind the resort.

1463
01:08:22.977 --> 01:08:24.521
If we approach it
from both sides.

1464
01:08:24.562 --> 01:08:26.272
one of us will see her.
Stay on your phone.

1465
01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:38.076
*

1466
01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:39.244
I have eyes on Judy.

1467
01:08:39.285 --> 01:08:40.412
Bailey: Eyes?

1468
01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.080
Well. that's what you say.
isn't it?

1469
01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:43.581
Sure.
Wait. where are you?

1470
01:08:43.623 --> 01:08:45.083
We're approaching
the intersection with

1471
01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:46.084
the red telephone boxes.

1472
01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:47.293
Alright. I know it.

1473
01:08:50.964 --> 01:08:53.675
Sebastian: Where did you
learn to ride a scooter?

1474
01:08:53.717 --> 01:08:55.343
Bailey: I started my career
as a traffic officer.

1475
01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:56.511
Motorcycle patrol.

1476
01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:59.014
Sebastian:
Well. that explains your skill.

1477
01:08:59.055 --> 01:09:00.640
She's coming to a stop.

1478
01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:06.229
*

1479
01:09:06.271 --> 01:09:07.605
(tires squealing)

1480
01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:09.274
Sebastian:
Oh. I think she's onto us.

1481
01:09:09.315 --> 01:09:11.568
Bailey: Stick with her.
I'll circle around.

1482
01:09:15.739 --> 01:09:17.365
Well. you can
add reckless driving

1483
01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:19.075
to her list of misdemeanors.

1484
01:09:19.117 --> 01:09:25.165
*

1485
01:09:25.206 --> 01:09:26.499
Bailey:
Veer closer to the main road.

1486
01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:30.545
I'll go straight.

1487
01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:39.554
*

1488
01:09:40.972 --> 01:09:42.140
Where are you?

1489
01:09:42.182 --> 01:09:44.351
Um. we're by the sea.

1490
01:09:44.392 --> 01:09:46.478
Bailey: Just stay on her.
I'll cut her off.

1491
01:09:46.519 --> 01:09:52.984
*

1492
01:09:53.026 --> 01:09:53.985
You okay?!

1493
01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:54.944
I'm fine.

1494
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.031
Sebastian: Hello.

1495
01:09:58.073 --> 01:09:59.699
Fancy a chat?

1496
01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:09.584
The local police
will be here shortly.

1497
01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:10.794
You have a lot
of explaining to do.

1498
01:10:10.835 --> 01:10:13.672
What's this about?
Why were you chasing me?

1499
01:10:13.713 --> 01:10:14.756
We know you're not a maid.

1500
01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:16.257
We know you work
for Grey Circle.

1501
01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:18.426
That's not a crime.

1502
01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:20.345
It is when you're obstructing
a murder investigation.

1503
01:10:20.387 --> 01:10:21.805
What?

1504
01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:23.306
We have reason to believe
Mark Aston was poisoned.

1505
01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:25.975
and you were the last
person to see him alive.

1506
01:10:26.017 --> 01:10:28.561
Poisoned? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1507
01:10:28.603 --> 01:10:29.688
I just cleaned the room.

1508
01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:31.064
Spare us the act.

1509
01:10:31.106 --> 01:10:32.482
You weren't in
the room to clean it.

1510
01:10:32.524 --> 01:10:34.359
What were you there for?

1511
01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:35.819
And remember.
anything you say could be

1512
01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.404
used in evidence against you.

1513
01:10:37.445 --> 01:10:38.780
At a murder trial.

1514
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:45.120
Look. I was just hired to get
some papers from Aston's room.

1515
01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:47.914
I was to take pictures of them
and email them to the client.

1516
01:10:47.956 --> 01:10:50.500
That was it.
but then. as I was leaving.

1517
01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:51.918
I saw him on the floor.

1518
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.671
I checked his pulse.
but he was already dead.

1519
01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:56.715
I assumed he'd had
a heart attack.

1520
01:10:56.756 --> 01:10:58.383
There was nothing I could do.

1521
01:10:58.425 --> 01:10:59.551
Who hired you?

1522
01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:00.927
That's confidential.

1523
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:04.055
Not according to the warrant.
which is on its way.

1524
01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:10.562
It was a woman
called Jennifer Tate.

1525
01:11:10.603 --> 01:11:16.735
*

1526
01:11:16.776 --> 01:11:18.028
(knocking)

1527
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:25.410
Ah. Stuart. Sally.
What a nice surprise.

1528
01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:26.411
Come in.

1529
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.291
Is this not
a social visit. Sally?

1530
01:11:31.332 --> 01:11:34.794
It's Bailey.
Detective Bailey. actually.

1531
01:11:34.836 --> 01:11:36.588
and this is my--

1532
01:11:36.629 --> 01:11:38.214
Partner.
Detective Moore.

1533
01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:40.342
Inspector?

1534
01:11:41.509 --> 01:11:43.303
Consultant?

1535
01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:44.554
Liaison.

1536
01:11:44.596 --> 01:11:46.056
Do you mind stepping out
so we can have a word?

1537
01:11:48.516 --> 01:11:51.478
Well. I guess that's why
you ask so many questions.

1538
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:55.982
Can you tell us
why you hired

1539
01:11:56.024 --> 01:11:57.692
Grey Circle to break
into Mark Aston's room

1540
01:11:57.734 --> 01:11:59.110
on the night
of his death?

1541
01:12:01.529 --> 01:12:05.784
I wanted to see Mark's
projections and plans

1542
01:12:05.825 --> 01:12:06.868
for the forthcoming year.

1543
01:12:10.038 --> 01:12:12.874
Look. I left my last job
because it was a boy's club.

1544
01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:15.377
and they kept me out of
the loop in important decisions.

1545
01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:19.130
So. when I discovered
that Tom Stevens was

1546
01:12:19.172 --> 01:12:21.007
conspiring with
Kevin Hamilton on something.

1547
01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:24.386
I-- I was determined not
to be kept in the dark again.

1548
01:12:25.929 --> 01:12:28.515
I thought if I could get
hold of Mark's papers.

1549
01:12:28.556 --> 01:12:30.725
I would level the playing field.

1550
01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:31.976
I mean. I didn't
know he was going to

1551
01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:33.561
drop dead of a heart attack.

1552
01:12:35.188 --> 01:12:37.357
What makes you think
it was a heart attack?

1553
01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:38.566
I just assumed.

1554
01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:42.320
He was a workaholic. okay?

1555
01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:44.280
And he drove the last CFO
to a heart attack.

1556
01:12:44.322 --> 01:12:47.409
So. it would be some
form of karmic justice.

1557
01:12:49.285 --> 01:12:51.371
You mean it wasn't
a heart attack?

1558
01:12:51.413 --> 01:12:53.373
(chuckling)

1559
01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:56.710
I knew it was
too convenient.

1560
01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:58.378
Convenient for who?

1561
01:12:58.420 --> 01:12:59.879
Take your pick.

1562
01:12:59.921 --> 01:13:01.923
The wife in love
with someone else.

1563
01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:04.551
That man after his own
slice of the fortune.

1564
01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:06.386
The ambitious CFO.

1565
01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:07.846
Maybe they're all
in on it together.

1566
01:13:07.887 --> 01:13:11.725
We can't comment on
an ongoing investigation.

1567
01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:14.686
but we will need to hold you
for further questioning.

1568
01:13:14.728 --> 01:13:17.105
and I'm afraid if you spoke to
anyone you could be considered

1569
01:13:17.147 --> 01:13:19.524
an accessory after the fact.

1570
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:21.735
and there is the small matter

1571
01:13:21.776 --> 01:13:23.445
of you hiring someone
to commit theft.

1572
01:13:30.368 --> 01:13:38.335
*

1573
01:13:40.628 --> 01:13:44.049
Sebastian: Just going to ask
you to. uh. help me with these.

1574
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:45.717
Sure. Of course.

1575
01:13:47.635 --> 01:13:48.553
Oh. nice.

1576
01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:52.849
How's the new
strapping on the wrist?

1577
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:54.100
It's much better.

1578
01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:55.685
Yeah. it's going to be fine.
I think.

1579
01:13:55.727 --> 01:13:56.936
Good.

1580
01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:59.439
You ready for tonight?

1581
01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:01.775
You mean the competition
or the case?

1582
01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:03.360
Well. I know
you'll crack the case.

1583
01:14:07.155 --> 01:14:08.615
I wanted to say thank you.

1584
01:14:08.656 --> 01:14:10.867
For what?

1585
01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:12.660
For helping me
with the competition.

1586
01:14:14.788 --> 01:14:19.542
You really are
quite a good teacher.

1587
01:14:19.584 --> 01:14:24.339
Oh. Well. you really
are quite a natural.

1588
01:14:24.381 --> 01:14:27.092
Okay. now I know you're just
being nice. because--

1589
01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:29.219
(chuckling)
--before this weekend.

1590
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.388
I hadn't danced in my life.

1591
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.557
- Really?
- Yeah.

1592
01:14:34.599 --> 01:14:36.559
What about weddings?

1593
01:14:36.601 --> 01:14:38.978
School disco? Prom?

1594
01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.980
I didn't go to prom.

1595
01:14:41.022 --> 01:14:43.483
I thought all Americans
went to prom.

1596
01:14:43.525 --> 01:14:47.237
It was a very
complicated time in my life.

1597
01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:53.493
My mom passed away
when I was 14.

1598
01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:55.995
Oh. I'm sorry.

1599
01:14:56.037 --> 01:14:59.124
No. I just--
I became very serious. you know?

1600
01:14:59.165 --> 01:15:00.959
I had to focus
on serious things.

1601
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:03.336
"Serious things?"

1602
01:15:03.378 --> 01:15:06.006
Yeah. like going to school.
getting good grades.

1603
01:15:06.047 --> 01:15:07.382
going to college.
It's...

1604
01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.803
It's why I became
so self-sufficient.

1605
01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:16.016
I thought that detectives
had to work with partners.

1606
01:15:16.057 --> 01:15:18.101
Ugh. now you sound
exactly like my captain.

1607
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:25.442
I don't know. I've just always
felt like it was best to just

1608
01:15:25.483 --> 01:15:26.860
do things myself.

1609
01:15:26.901 --> 01:15:30.238
To answer your question. no.

1610
01:15:31.906 --> 01:15:33.408
I'd never danced
before I met you.

1611
01:15:34.784 --> 01:15:37.579
Well. let's go dancing.
detective.

1612
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.080
Let's go. partner.

1613
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:53.470
*

1614
01:16:07.108 --> 01:16:08.860
- Sebastian: Oh. hello!
- Tom: Hey. Stuart.

1615
01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:10.070
Mary:
Well. don't you look handsome?

1616
01:16:10.111 --> 01:16:11.821
Oh. why thank you. Mary.
Likewise.

1617
01:16:11.863 --> 01:16:13.073
Thank you.

1618
01:16:13.114 --> 01:16:14.908
And Sally.
that is a lovely dress.

1619
01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:16.242
Oh. thank you so much.

1620
01:16:16.284 --> 01:16:17.619
Oh. but what happened
to your hand?

1621
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.538
Oh. it's just a little accident.
It's nothing.

1622
01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.083
Well. I hope it won't
affect your performance.

1623
01:16:23.124 --> 01:16:24.542
You know what?

1624
01:16:24.584 --> 01:16:26.461
I actually think it's gonna
help me focus more.

1625
01:16:26.503 --> 01:16:27.962
Where's--
Where's Jennifer?

1626
01:16:28.004 --> 01:16:30.382
She's been taken ill.
apparently.

1627
01:16:30.423 --> 01:16:32.092
which takes her
out of the running.

1628
01:16:32.133 --> 01:16:35.428
Still. it's going to be
a very competitive night.

1629
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.681
The judges won't go easy
on anyone. will they. Barbra?

1630
01:16:37.722 --> 01:16:39.265
Huh?

1631
01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:40.934
Oh. no.
(chuckling)

1632
01:16:40.975 --> 01:16:42.602
I won't go easy on anyone.

1633
01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:44.521
Excellent.
That's what I like to hear.

1634
01:16:44.562 --> 01:16:49.526
*

1635
01:16:54.406 --> 01:16:57.492
(applauding)

1636
01:16:57.534 --> 01:17:00.412
Good evening. everyone.

1637
01:17:00.453 --> 01:17:02.789
Well done on making
the final night.

1638
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:04.374
Kevin. will you do the honors?

1639
01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:05.375
Absolutely.

1640
01:17:06.876 --> 01:17:09.796
Dancers. take your places.

1641
01:17:09.838 --> 01:17:11.381
and get ready to tango!

1642
01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:12.549
(applauding. cheering)

1643
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:14.509
Musica!

1644
01:17:14.551 --> 01:17:19.514
(applauding)

1645
01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:22.434
(music playing)

1646
01:17:22.475 --> 01:17:24.227
How's your foot?

1647
01:17:24.269 --> 01:17:26.104
Is it going to be okay
on the stone floor?

1648
01:17:26.146 --> 01:17:27.230
Oh. it'll be fine.

1649
01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:31.359
I think this stone
is Travertine.

1650
01:17:33.069 --> 01:17:34.696
Now. remember
the central connection.

1651
01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:36.114
When I lean. you follow.
And...

1652
01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:39.868
Travertine is a stone.

1653
01:17:39.909 --> 01:17:43.204
The former CFO who died.
his name was Travertine.

1654
01:17:43.246 --> 01:17:44.122
Uh-huh.

1655
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.251
What happened to the former CFO?

1656
01:17:52.339 --> 01:17:55.884
Heart attack. and he was just
one week away from retirement.

1657
01:17:58.928 --> 01:18:00.764
They'd just bought a boat. Look.

1658
01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:06.936
*

1659
01:18:06.978 --> 01:18:08.313
He died.

1660
01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:09.898
Tom: I thought that was
before you arrived. Barbra.

1661
01:18:09.939 --> 01:18:11.024
I heard about it.

1662
01:18:12.984 --> 01:18:14.235
Who's the girl? His daughter?

1663
01:18:14.277 --> 01:18:17.405
Nothing's more
important than family.

1664
01:18:17.447 --> 01:18:21.159
They work themselves and those
around them into the ground.

1665
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:22.118
Literally.

1666
01:18:26.539 --> 01:18:28.333
Barbra Stone.

1667
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:30.085
She's Travertine's daughter.

1668
01:18:30.126 --> 01:18:31.961
She's the one in the photograph.

1669
01:18:32.003 --> 01:18:34.172
The mousey girl in
the picture is Barbra?

1670
01:18:36.257 --> 01:18:39.511
Wow. and I thought
you made a transformation.

1671
01:18:39.552 --> 01:18:41.888
Wait. if Barbra
poisoned Mark Aston.

1672
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.599
she shouldn't be left alone
with everyone's drinks.

1673
01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.434
Let's go.

1674
01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:50.980
*

1675
01:18:51.022 --> 01:18:52.482
Sebastian: Excuse me. sir.

1676
01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:56.277
Bailey: Barbra.
I need to speak with you.

1677
01:18:56.319 --> 01:18:58.530
(gasping)

1678
01:19:01.241 --> 01:19:02.826
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

1679
01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:14.838
*

1680
01:19:20.593 --> 01:19:21.553
Bailey: Barbra!

1681
01:19:24.514 --> 01:19:25.515
Barbra. just stop!

1682
01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:29.894
Ouch! Ouch. ouch.

1683
01:19:29.936 --> 01:19:31.730
Oh. these women are fast.

1684
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:39.487
*

1685
01:19:39.529 --> 01:19:41.489
Barbra. just wait!

1686
01:19:41.531 --> 01:19:44.159
*

1687
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.326
(panting)

1688
01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:47.328
Come on.

1689
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:49.789
There's nowhere to go.

1690
01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:50.957
(panting)

1691
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.586
They don't deserve to live.

1692
01:19:56.129 --> 01:19:57.380
They killed my father.

1693
01:19:58.548 --> 01:20:00.091
They stole our future!

1694
01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:02.260
I don't want to
cause you any more pain.

1695
01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:06.765
Okay. just come on.
Let's sit down.

1696
01:20:06.806 --> 01:20:08.683
We'll talk.

1697
01:20:08.725 --> 01:20:09.893
We'll figure this out.

1698
01:20:10.894 --> 01:20:11.811
(screaming)

1699
01:20:11.853 --> 01:20:13.980
(grunting)

1700
01:20:14.022 --> 01:20:16.483
(both grunting)

1701
01:20:16.524 --> 01:20:18.026
Bailey!

1702
01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:22.280
(both grunting)

1703
01:20:22.322 --> 01:20:24.199
Barbra Travertine.
you're under arrest for--

1704
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.533
for the murder of Mark Aston.

1705
01:20:26.576 --> 01:20:29.120
(both panting)

1706
01:20:29.162 --> 01:20:33.041
Nice move. breaking the central
connection. detective.

1707
01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:40.298
(people speaking over radio)

1708
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.717
So. it was all
about revenge. huh?

1709
01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:44.511
Revenge and money.

1710
01:20:44.552 --> 01:20:47.389
Barbra blamed Mark Aston for
working her father to death.

1711
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.225
but also. because he never
reached retirement.

1712
01:20:50.266 --> 01:20:52.811
he didn't get the final bonus or
share options he was promised.

1713
01:20:52.852 --> 01:20:54.145
That would have
amounted to millions.

1714
01:20:54.187 --> 01:20:56.356
which would have
eventually gone to Barbra.

1715
01:20:56.398 --> 01:20:58.233
Mm. you know
what they say. huh?

1716
01:20:58.274 --> 01:21:00.276
It's always
about the spouse.

1717
01:21:00.318 --> 01:21:02.737
Not in this case.
Mrs. Aston was innocent.

1718
01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:04.447
Well. innocent of murder.

1719
01:21:04.489 --> 01:21:05.949
Before Mark Aston's death.

1720
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:08.243
Kevin Hamilton and Tom Stevens
were conspiring

1721
01:21:08.284 --> 01:21:10.745
to position the company
for a hostile takeover.

1722
01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:12.414
And Mary was helping them.

1723
01:21:12.455 --> 01:21:13.915
She wanted a new
life with Hamilton.

1724
01:21:13.957 --> 01:21:15.875
and he wanted a chunk
of the sale money.

1725
01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.836
And Stevens wanted
the CEO job.

1726
01:21:17.877 --> 01:21:20.171
But sharp business
practices aren't a crime.

1727
01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:23.883
Are they?

1728
01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:25.510
Not in this case.

1729
01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:28.471
Alright. you two. I better go
and start the paperwork.

1730
01:21:28.513 --> 01:21:30.557
It's been a pleasure
working with you. Ana.

1731
01:21:30.598 --> 01:21:31.641
Thank you for everything. Ana.

1732
01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:32.642
You're welcome.

1733
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.146
(sighing)

1734
01:21:38.481 --> 01:21:40.275
What's wrong?

1735
01:21:40.316 --> 01:21:42.110
Nothing.

1736
01:21:42.152 --> 01:21:45.488
It's just we didn't get
to do the dance we learned.

1737
01:21:48.366 --> 01:21:49.284
Follow me.

1738
01:21:49.325 --> 01:21:59.336
*

1739
01:22:01.212 --> 01:22:11.181
*

1740
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:27.489
*

1741
01:22:35.455 --> 01:22:45.423
*

1742
01:22:55.141 --> 01:22:58.019
Well. you have to admit.

1743
01:22:58.061 --> 01:22:59.771
We make a pretty good team.

1744
01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:02.190
Ah. whatever you say. Sherlock.

1745
01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:05.527
Oh. I'm glad you agree with me.
my dear Watson.

1746
01:23:05.568 --> 01:23:06.903
Wait. hang on.

1747
01:23:06.945 --> 01:23:09.739
There's no way I'm the Watson
in this arrangement.

1748
01:23:09.781 --> 01:23:10.740
Arrangement?

1749
01:23:12.117 --> 01:23:13.618
I was thinking partnership.

1750
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:15.704
Oh. don't start with me.

1751
01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:17.747
(laughing)

1752
01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:22.293
*

1753
01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:25.046
So. now that
you've dazzled Interpol.

1754
01:23:25.088 --> 01:23:27.048
where do you think
our next case will take us?

1755
01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:28.133
Our next case?

1756
01:23:28.174 --> 01:23:30.051
I think I fancy Paris.

1757
01:23:30.093 --> 01:23:32.303
London. or Broadway.

1758
01:23:32.345 --> 01:23:34.848
(laughing)
Steady there. Benoit.

1759
01:23:34.889 --> 01:23:35.765
One step at a time.
