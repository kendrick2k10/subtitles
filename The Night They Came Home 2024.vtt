3
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.155
Hello. sun.

4
00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.681
I ain't never thought
I had much to lose.

5
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.166
But now they done separated me
from my brothers.

6
00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:52.650
Though I know
we shall reunite
once we leave this earth.

7
00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:02.356
My last time getting
to see you rise.

8
00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:10.929
My last morning
on your green earth.

9
00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:20.287
Things look a whole lot
more beautiful

10
00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:23.464
when you know
it's the last time
that you gonna see 'em.

11
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.261
<i>No dancin'
to your heathen music.
Rufus Buck!</i>

12
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.785
<i>And no praying
to your animal gods.</i>

13
00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:44.876
<i>No speakin'
in no savage tongues
of yours either.</i>

14
00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.406
<i>We will kill the Indian
in you. Rufus Buck.</i>

15
00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:54.059
<i>to save the man.</i>

16
00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:02.807
Hey there. feller.

17
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:07.725
Heard you're
a gravedigger.

18
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.511
Said you buried
a few famous people.

19
00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.556
Buy you a drink?

20
00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:16.604
Cognac!

21
00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:18.954
Top shelf.

22
00:04:21.217 --> 00:04:23.524
Higher.
Top shelf. Bob.

23
00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:55.338
Call you Digger?

24
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:57.688
Digging graves
is what I do.

25
00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.212
I'd like to think
it doesn't define me...

26
00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:03.172
but it does.

27
00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:06.958
There's talk about the frontier
coming to an end.

28
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:09.265
especially for men
like you and me.

29
00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:13.313
You've been out there.
What have you seen?

30
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:16.925
Seen too many
reckless youngsters

31
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.015
end up with. uh. bullets
in their skull.

32
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:24.498
But as far
as the Wild West
being over.

33
00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:29.720
it ended in my mind.
July 1st. 1896.

34
00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:33.376
And what happened then?

35
00:05:36.074 --> 00:05:38.250
Last outlaw gang
was hanged.

36
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.516
down Fort Smith way.

37
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.608
I was there
to do dirty work
at an unmarked grave.

38
00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:49.566
And what was
so special about this gang

39
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.003
that they ended
the Wild West
all by theyselves?

40
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.485
Easy there.
this is liquid gold.

41
00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.184
You want to hear
the end of the story or not?

42
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.541
They called themselves
the Rufus Buck Gang.

43
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.546
Teenage boys.
half Black. half injun.

44
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.984
Came together
at the hanging
of Cherokee Bill.

45
00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:20.336
down Fort Smith way.
in March '96.

46
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.512
Had plans for an uprising.

47
00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:27.387
or a vengeance
over the whites
who stole their land.

48
00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:33.436
Some say they were
haunted by wild spirits.

49
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.223
ghosts of fallen injuns
and slaves.

50
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.226
Others that they were
senseless killers.

51
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.446
just too young
to know better.

52
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.231
took down
Sheriff John Garrett.

53
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.365
But their reign
of terror began

54
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.846
<i>with the old Palmer family.</i>

55
00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.810
Let's go say bye
to Paul and Tommy.

56
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:12.475
I'm ready to go. Dad.

57
00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:13.955
Oh. Tommy.
hold your pants on.

58
00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:16.131
I'm almost done.

59
00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:17.437
Well. why don't you
come over here
and give us a big hug?

60
00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:22.964
Tommy!

61
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.056
We made enough food
for two days.

62
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.492
Three. in case
you need it.

63
00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:32.016
I mean.
if you get held up.

64
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.018
Thank you.

65
00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:35.455
There's some jerky
in there too
you can chew on.

66
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:36.978
if you get in a pinch.

67
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.371
Tommy.

68
00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:44.289
- Oh. I love you.
- I love you.

69
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.727
- You're all grown up now.
-  Oh.

70
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:49.512
- You and Pa gotta watch
out for each other.
- Ma. you're being silly.

71
00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:52.428
Fort Smith is only
20 miles away.
we'll be there tonight.

72
00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:55.779
Get supplies in the morning.
then we'll head straight home.

73
00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:58.086
Just leave a porch lantern
burning for us.

74
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.436
As soon as we hear
that buckboard comin'.
we'll put coffee on.

75
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.177
- Grandma?
- That's right.

76
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:03.961
And we'll bake
a chocolate cake tomorrow.

77
00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:05.702
I wanna go with you.
Daddy.

78
00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:07.138
Please? I ain't been to town
since last March

79
00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:08.531
I know.

80
00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:09.663
- Next time. all right?
- Please.

81
00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:11.752
You gotta stay here.

82
00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:13.710
You gotta help
Mama and Granny
with all the cannin'.

83
00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:16.104
All right?
I'll bring you back
something special.

84
00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:17.845
I hate cannin'.

85
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.629
I'll have everything
under control while you're gone.

86
00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:21.892
You know. the tribes
has been quiet as mice

87
00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:24.112
especially since Judge Parker
started hanging
a bunch of 'em.

88
00:08:26.418 --> 00:08:29.117
All right. Tommy. come on.
We got a schedule to keep.

89
00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:32.860
Godspeed. Chuck.

90
00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:34.557
Give your parents
our love.

91
00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:39.823
- Bye. Daddy. I love you.
- I love you too.

92
00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:42.043
- I'll do a good job
with the cannin'.
- All right.

93
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:45.786
And maybe.
for my surprise.

94
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.439
you'll get me that gingham dress
I picked out of that catalog?

95
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:50.181
-  Nope.
- Maybe?

96
00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:52.488
I don't know
what you're talking about.

97
00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:54.534
- But I love you!
- I love you too!

98
00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:02.498
Grandpa said
Judge Parker's right

99
00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:04.761
in hanging them outlaws
in public.

100
00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:06.197
It's a gruesome
practice. son.

101
00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:08.330
I don't even think
in a civilized world

102
00:09:08.504 --> 00:09:11.594
that that should be
indulged in.

103
00:09:11.768 --> 00:09:14.031
But our preacher says
an eye for an eye
is in the Bible.

104
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.990
Yeah. but an eye for an eye.

105
00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:18.645
if both men end up blind.
what good is that?

106
00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:22.126
I think there's a creek...

107
00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:27.305
right down over there.
Let's stop it right up here.

108
00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:30.047
Why don't you
fill up the canteen?

109
00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:31.266
All right.

110
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.482
Pa!

111
00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:19.183
Pa!

112
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:21.751
You all right?

113
00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:40.204
I think we got your horse
back for you. Sheriff.

114
00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:42.337
Ain't he hitched
to this here buckboard?

115
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:49.431
Color me blind
if he ain't. Maoma.

116
00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:51.215
Well. well.

117
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:53.435
Looks like we got ourselves
a couple of horse thieves.

118
00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:55.089
We ain't
no horse thieves!

119
00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:56.220
No. no. no.

120
00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:57.744
No. this. uh--

121
00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:59.484
this here horse
is-is mine.

122
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.573
I bought it five years ago
at Fort Smith.

123
00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:03.314
I still have
the bill of sale.

124
00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:05.142
You wouldn't have
that bill of sale up on you?

125
00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:07.275
No. I don't have the bill
of sale on my person.

126
00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:10.104
but the ranchers around here
know that this is my-my horse.

127
00:11:10.278 --> 00:11:11.801
His name is Casey.

128
00:11:11.975 --> 00:11:13.585
We ain't the ranchers
from around here now. is we?

129
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.024
And that horse
right there. that's mine.

130
00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:19.417
And his name ain't
no Casey. it's Demon.

131
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:21.115
And you stole him.

132
00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:27.034
Which is a hanging offense
in these here parts.

133
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.515
If my understanding of the law
serves me correct-like.

134
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.169
Listen closely. old feller.

135
00:11:32.343 --> 00:11:33.997
You most wrongly
transgressed

136
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.651
when you done pilfered
our good sheriff's mount.

137
00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:38.436
He ain't more than 19.

138
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.829
How're you a sheriff?

139
00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:41.178
He's older than he look!

140
00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:42.397
We his posse.

141
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:44.007
We've been
legally deputized

142
00:11:44.181 --> 00:11:45.922
by the chiefs
of the Creek Tribe.

143
00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:48.098
We ain't about to take no buck
from no horse thieves.

144
00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:49.883
Boys. I say
we have a trial first.

145
00:11:50.057 --> 00:11:52.973
You need a fair trial.
always before a hangin'.

146
00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.104
Sam.

147
00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:56.106
Maoma.

148
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.499
Let's go ahead
and tie him up.

149
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.637
Sir.
you're making
a huge mistake.

150
00:12:05.812 --> 00:12:07.770
But this horse is mine.
I swear.

151
00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:09.598
- Maoma.
- This horse is mine.
I am not a horse rustler.

152
00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:11.382
Maoma. get the boy.

153
00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:13.689
No. no. no. no. no.
No. you can't. you can't.

154
00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:16.561
You can't tell us
what we can't do.

155
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.911
Pa!

156
00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:21.305
But if'n you behave.

157
00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:24.961
I'll go ahead and let
your boy live and go free.

158
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:26.876
Pa. no!

159
00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:30.575
No need to be
getting upset. boy.

160
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.360
You know.
when I was in school.

161
00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:35.798
they told me a story
about y'all white folk God.

162
00:12:35.972 --> 00:12:38.845
and how he done killed
all y'all people in a Flood

163
00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:41.935
for being so evil
and sinful.

164
00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:44.633
Now. you believe
in God. boy?

165
00:12:44.807 --> 00:12:46.548
Sure do.
God is good!

166
00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:48.419
"God is good."

167
00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:51.858
Well. why'd he go ahead
and let y'all live again?

168
00:12:52.032 --> 00:12:54.469
To come and take
the Indian land?

169
00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:56.340
Can't you see

170
00:12:56.514 --> 00:12:59.300
that there just might need
to be another Flood?

171
00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:00.997
We did--

172
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:02.477
We didn't do this
to your people. friend.

173
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.521
- Hey!

174
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:05.393
We are not your friends.

175
00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:06.655
Hey. Lewis.

176
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:08.439
How many men we done hanged

177
00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:10.485
that claimed
that they was innocent

178
00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:12.617
if'n we listen to them.
which we did not?

179
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.184
Damn straight. Lucky.

180
00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:15.882
We saw right through
their dirty lies.

181
00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:18.014
I beg you. please.
Please don't do this.

182
00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:21.539
Okay. now. We ain't gonna be
needing no more testimony.

183
00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:23.454
Justice shall now be served.

184
00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:25.152
Aight.

185
00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:26.327
Okay. y'all boys go ahead
and be the jury.

186
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.720
I'll be the judge. Now...

187
00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:32.420
How many of y'all see
that this horse thief
right here is guilty?

188
00:13:32.594 --> 00:13:34.596
- Aye.
-  Aye.

189
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.512
Ayes have it.
Guilty as charged. then.

190
00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:40.645
The sentence is
death by hanging.

191
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.951
Pa!

192
00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:43.126
No!

193
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.171
Sam.

194
00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.177
Pa!

195
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:53.049
Pa!

196
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:58.838
Pa! Pa. no!

197
00:13:59.012 --> 00:14:00.013
Hold it right there.

198
00:14:01.014 --> 00:14:02.363
Go ahead and let him have

199
00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:03.755
a little minute with his boy.

200
00:14:05.018 --> 00:14:07.107
- Tommy. come here. Hey.
- No. Pa!

201
00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:08.935
- Hey. hey.
- No.

202
00:14:09.109 --> 00:14:11.546
- You be a good boy. okay?

203
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.114
You take care of your mama.
You don't let her pity on me.

204
00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:15.680
-  No. Pa.
- You let her know

205
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.552
that I return
to the Lord now. okay?

206
00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:21.730
- Sam.
- No!

207
00:14:25.647 --> 00:14:28.215
Stop it! Stop!

208
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.739
Pa. please!

209
00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:35.570
No!

210
00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:38.529
No. Pa!

211
00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:44.144
No. Pa!

212
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.987
Let's trade out
these horses. leave
this boy and his wagon.

213
00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:17.786
You. girl!

214
00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:21.094
Where's your keeper?

215
00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:24.227
You know
who I'm talking about.

216
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:26.751
Peta Nocona.

217
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.362
Keeper of the harem.

218
00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:30.146
You go get him.

219
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.888
- Why are you here?
- Go from here.

220
00:15:34.846 --> 00:15:36.631
Girl. you better
go get him now.

221
00:15:39.503 --> 00:15:40.940
How can I help you?

222
00:15:53.648 --> 00:15:59.001
Sheriff Garrett was killed
recently. Mr. Nocona.

223
00:15:59.175 --> 00:16:01.177
But you already know that.

224
00:16:01.351 --> 00:16:03.266
As a medicine man.

225
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.051
you know everything
that happens
in the Creek Nation.

226
00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:12.623
People tell me things
because they trust me.

227
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:16.976
I'm about to have
my lunch. Come.

228
00:16:19.152 --> 00:16:23.243
John Garrett was killed
down the road a ways.

229
00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:25.375
Eat. Drink with me.

230
00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.337
I'll have his body
brought to you.

231
00:16:31.729 --> 00:16:34.123
I assume. then.
you know
who murdered him.

232
00:16:34.297 --> 00:16:35.820
"Know" is a strong word.

233
00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:38.867
I suspect it was young
Rufus Buck

234
00:16:39.085 --> 00:16:40.956
<i>and some others.</i>

235
00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:44.699
<i>The Davis Brothers.
Lewis and Lucky.</i>

236
00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:46.092
Perhaps. uh.

237
00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:49.051
<i>Sam Sampson
and Maoma July.</i>

238
00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:51.923
They all observed
the hanging of Cherokee Bill
at Fort Smith.

239
00:16:52.098 --> 00:16:54.143
A little blackbird told me

240
00:16:54.317 --> 00:16:57.277
it kindled a rage
in these young half-breeds.

241
00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:00.671
They felt the need
to kill somebody.

242
00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:03.892
Somebody white. that is.

243
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.026
Where do you reckon
these five be now?

244
00:17:09.637 --> 00:17:10.681
Who knows?

245
00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:13.554
But they won't go far.

246
00:17:13.728 --> 00:17:15.512
Well. why is that?

247
00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:17.123
Because they are very stupid.

248
00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:19.908
Hm.

249
00:17:20.082 --> 00:17:21.475
Well. stupid is
the worst kind
of dangerous.

250
00:17:23.172 --> 00:17:25.218
Especially now
that they got
a taste for blood.

251
00:17:25.392 --> 00:17:26.480
But can you blame them?

252
00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:27.742
For murder?

253
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.658
It would only be fair.

254
00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:33.487
Well. what about you.
Mr. Maledon?

255
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:35.141
I don't blame 'em.

256
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:37.273
I hang 'em.

257
00:17:38.318 --> 00:17:40.407
- Mm.
- As the law dictates.

258
00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:44.019
The white man's law dictated

259
00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:47.283
that generations
of Indian men and women

260
00:17:47.457 --> 00:17:48.980
were slaughtered
on their own lands.

261
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:51.461
Not to mention
the African people

262
00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:52.984
were brought here in chains.

263
00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:55.639
This law you speak of.

264
00:17:55.813 --> 00:17:59.339
it is a fickle judge indeed
of what you claim is fair.

265
00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:01.906
Hm.

266
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:05.084
Hey. you have a spittoon?

267
00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:18.749
Thank you.

268
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:24.886
That's a filthy habit. sir.

269
00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:26.801
Hm.

270
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:31.806
Well. you got a lot
of these young squaws

271
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.417
running around
for your pleasure.

272
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:37.377
Is that a filthy habit
or is that a predilection?

273
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:39.292
I get those two
mixed up. George.

274
00:18:41.337 --> 00:18:43.818
I look after my people
as family. Mr. Heck Thomas.

275
00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:45.559
Hm.

276
00:18:46.516 --> 00:18:49.476
Mr. Nocona. you gave us
the names of the killers.

277
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.391
For that. we are grateful.

278
00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:54.089
Those Indian
school missionaries

279
00:18:54.263 --> 00:18:55.873
thought they were doing
their god's work.

280
00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:58.746
by driving the heathen demons
out of us savages.

281
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.575
Whatever happened
to Rufus Buck and his gang.

282
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:03.272
they were turned
that way by the whites.

283
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.754
I call it
death by civilization.

284
00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:08.930
Hm.

285
00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.977
Well. that's
a real sad story.

286
00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:17.634
What's so special
about this Rufus?

287
00:19:17.808 --> 00:19:20.202
They think he's destined
to be a great leader

288
00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:22.248
and drive
all the white people
from the land.

289
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:26.469
I can't say I agree
about his future.

290
00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:30.212
but I'm just
a simple medicine man.

291
00:20:22.438 --> 00:20:24.440
So. uh.

292
00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:27.182
you suspect you're gonna
take your turn walking
anytime soon. George?

293
00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:30.185
Let me ride
a little more.

294
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.361
This lumbago
is killing me.

295
00:20:32.535 --> 00:20:34.885
You ain't got
not damn lumbago.

296
00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:37.584
I've seen you prancing up
on them gallows

297
00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:39.238
like you was a damn cat
with a canary.

298
00:20:39.412 --> 00:20:41.152
You ain't got
no damn lumbago.

299
00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:44.765
Lumbago hurts
all the time.

300
00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:46.810
I just don't let
the people see it.

301
00:20:46.984 --> 00:20:50.031
Oh. so it's your pride
that makes you ride. huh?

302
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:53.469
No. Just appearance
and style.

303
00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:55.602
That's what you gotta have.

304
00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:58.822
You don't have that.
you're nothing
but skin and bones.

305
00:20:58.996 --> 00:21:01.956
Besides. I got
this writer. Crosby.

306
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.133
He's gonna do a piece
on me for a dime novel.

307
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:08.136
What. you gonna be
the next Buffalo Bill Cody?

308
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.444
Nope. Just a simple hangman.

309
00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:13.707
With a legend to tend to.

310
00:21:13.881 --> 00:21:15.317
Now. George. how in the hell
did you become

311
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:17.885
such a celebrity
for hangin' people?

312
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:20.496
I'm not just a hangman.

313
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.542
I'm a deputy marshal.
just like you.

314
00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:26.459
And I've dealt with my share
of hard cases.

315
00:21:26.633 --> 00:21:30.811
Not as many as you. though.
but a half dozen or so.

316
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:32.421
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

317
00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:34.945
- Oh. Georgie. Look.

318
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:56.010
Boy.

319
00:21:56.184 --> 00:21:58.055
What you doin' out here?

320
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:05.585
It's all right. son.

321
00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:08.152
We're federal marshals
out of Fort Smith.
for Judge Parker.

322
00:22:10.503 --> 00:22:12.766
Man who killed my father
had a badge too.

323
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.726
Said my father
was a horse thief.

324
00:22:18.162 --> 00:22:19.729
That your daddy
in the back. son?

325
00:22:21.644 --> 00:22:23.385
Yes. sir.

326
00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:26.345
Man with the badge let me
take him home to bury him.

327
00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:33.787
You mean they did this
to your daddy?

328
00:22:35.136 --> 00:22:37.225
Sheriff and four men.

329
00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:40.402
Said they was his deputies.

330
00:22:40.576 --> 00:22:44.319
And they was all young.
some of them was half-breeds.

331
00:22:47.627 --> 00:22:48.802
Let's take him with us.

332
00:23:28.276 --> 00:23:30.147
All right. Tommy.

333
00:23:30.321 --> 00:23:32.193
I want you to stay here.
son. all right?

334
00:23:32.367 --> 00:23:33.977
- Yes. sir.
- You tend the horses.

335
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:35.196
Let's go. George.

336
00:24:52.882 --> 00:24:55.058
Where's Jolene?!

337
00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:56.625
- God damn it. George.
get that boy outta here!

338
00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.758
He don't need to see this!
Get him out of here!

339
00:24:58.932 --> 00:25:01.717
Jolene! She could still
be in there!

340
00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:05.460
We all die.
It was their turn.

341
00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:07.331
Relax. Relax.

342
00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:04.911
<i>Heck Thomas
was as tough as old boot.</i>

343
00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:09.655
Turned many a soul like Maoma
over to types like me.

344
00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:13.789
though none would imagine
little old Jolene...

345
00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:16.966
would do the honors
with a pitchfork.

346
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.504
Hey there. cousin.

347
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:35.855
If it isn't
Charles Buck himself.

348
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:38.422
How's the fishing?
Catch us any supper?

349
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:40.468
Haven't caught nothing.

350
00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:42.252
One bite and I lost it.

351
00:26:42.426 --> 00:26:43.906
How is you. Rufus?

352
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.517
Oh. I'm better than ever.
And yourself?

353
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:50.478
Disgusted.
My ma and pa want me

354
00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:53.437
to keep going
to that there Indian school.

355
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:54.656
They won't let me drop out.

356
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.571
Indian school.

357
00:26:56.745 --> 00:26:58.312
What they trying to teach
you all up in there. huh?

358
00:26:58.486 --> 00:27:01.010
How to be more
like the paleface?

359
00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:03.404
Tell you that our ways
of life is over?

360
00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:07.147
I don't feed
into their poison
not one bit.

361
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:10.541
Reason we started
robbing 'em. killing 'em.

362
00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:12.456
We gonna scare 'em
off this land.

363
00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:15.721
And we gonna take
they women too.
just like they took ours.

364
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:20.421
We wild and free.

365
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:23.467
Wild and free. huh?

366
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.468
Who is we. Rufus?

367
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.035
Oh. you know 'em.

368
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:28.647
Sam. Lucky. Lewis.

369
00:27:29.604 --> 00:27:31.084
What about Maoma?

370
00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:34.740
Little white girl
done killed 'em...

371
00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:38.657
while we was kidnapping 'em.

372
00:27:38.831 --> 00:27:40.267
So we gon' go ahead
and sell her off

373
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.486
to that medicine man
in the Creek Nation.

374
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.053
But on the way
to Creek Nation.

375
00:27:44.227 --> 00:27:47.709
we's going pull us off
one big ol' job.

376
00:27:47.883 --> 00:27:51.321
Have all the white folks
around here scared of us.

377
00:27:53.062 --> 00:27:54.455
You reckon I could take
Maoma's place?

378
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:56.675
Just what I was thinking.

379
00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:08.425
Seeing all that blood
up on you. Maoma's blood.

380
00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:10.601
make me wanna
kill you myself

381
00:28:10.776 --> 00:28:12.647
for my dearly
departed brother.

382
00:28:46.812 --> 00:28:49.902
All right. So what's
the play here. boss?

383
00:28:50.076 --> 00:28:51.730
We gonna take what we want?

384
00:28:51.904 --> 00:28:53.470
- Damn straight. Lucky.

385
00:28:53.644 --> 00:28:55.037
Hey!

386
00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:57.387
Hey. Bart!

387
00:28:57.561 --> 00:28:58.649
Get out here!

388
00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:02.828
What in the hell is
the matter with you?

389
00:29:03.002 --> 00:29:05.700
Shouting at me like that.
I spilled my whiskey.

390
00:29:05.874 --> 00:29:07.571
Get down
and lick it up then.

391
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:10.400
Bart. you got plenty much more
where that came from.

392
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:12.011
Now ain't that right. Bart?

393
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.361
I...

394
00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:18.800
Yeah. I...

395
00:29:18.974 --> 00:29:21.281
I'm gonna head-head
back to the hole

396
00:29:21.455 --> 00:29:23.022
and get you guys
some firewater.

397
00:29:23.196 --> 00:29:25.502
Don't you call it
no firewater. God damn it.

398
00:29:25.676 --> 00:29:28.027
That's what you call it
when you water it down
and give it to us injuns.

399
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.464
Get 'em drunk. fleece 'em.

400
00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:34.076
You know.

401
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.339
I spent some time
with your late father.

402
00:29:36.513 --> 00:29:40.604
I always gave him
whiskey for free. Rufus.

403
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.346
And you remember that.
don't you. son?

404
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.959
Oh. sure. sure. sure.
I remember.

405
00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:48.525
I remember
you used to water it down

406
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:51.441
and charge us triple
the price for a bottle.

407
00:29:51.615 --> 00:29:55.402
Same bottle that paleface
ain't even wanna touch.
Right?

408
00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:58.100
Same paleface used
to give us trinkets
and stole all our land?

409
00:30:01.887 --> 00:30:03.366
You remember?

410
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.804
We fixin' to drive
all the palefaces out.

411
00:30:05.978 --> 00:30:09.720
There's too many
of us nowadays.

412
00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:13.899
It's 1895.
You can't drive
a white man out

413
00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:18.860
with butchering and scalping
and everything like that.

414
00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:20.775
left and right.

415
00:30:20.949 --> 00:30:22.646
We should learn
to get along.

416
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:25.998
I mean. the white man
and the the red man. and...

417
00:30:26.172 --> 00:30:27.869
and even the Black man.

418
00:30:28.043 --> 00:30:29.740
Shut up. old man.
Fetch us that whiskey.

419
00:30:29.915 --> 00:30:32.569
Don't be stingy now.
grab one for each of us.

420
00:30:32.743 --> 00:30:35.094
I don't mind.
I just. uh.

421
00:30:35.268 --> 00:30:36.747
I hide the good stuff
back there.

422
00:30:36.922 --> 00:30:39.141
so I'll be
right-right back. boys.

423
00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:41.013
Just hang there.

424
00:31:15.917 --> 00:31:17.136
What you doin' there. Bart?

425
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.983
Whew!

426
00:31:45.294 --> 00:31:46.992
Whooo! Hey. Rufus!

427
00:31:50.517 --> 00:31:53.302
Hey. I mean...

428
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:56.740
We can sell
all this whiskey
and these rifles

429
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.003
for a lot of cash. Rufus.

430
00:31:58.177 --> 00:32:00.048
Damn right. Lucky.

431
00:32:00.222 --> 00:32:03.269
We gonna get stinkin' drunk
and have us a hell of a party.

432
00:32:07.577 --> 00:32:12.843
Go ahead and dedicate this
to our dearly departed
brother. Maoma.

433
00:32:15.672 --> 00:32:17.239
He died for our cause.

434
00:32:17.413 --> 00:32:19.459
<i>If I had to choose a man</i>

435
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:21.896
to bring the rest
of them hellions in.

436
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.333
it would be Heck Thomas.

437
00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:25.813
How many you hunted?

438
00:32:25.987 --> 00:32:27.946
Law ain't my trade.

439
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.122
Well. the law
is the trade...

440
00:32:31.645 --> 00:32:35.692
of men the likes
of old Judge Parker.

441
00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:38.739
and his public executioner.

442
00:32:38.913 --> 00:32:41.176
George Maledon

443
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:48.444
They're the most diabolical
bastards in the territory.

444
00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:52.231
I relish the thought
of giving them a dose
of their own medicine.

445
00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:55.103
My ropes will stretch.

446
00:32:55.277 --> 00:32:57.105
That's a promise.

447
00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:00.630
George. you do not
hang a man!

448
00:33:00.804 --> 00:33:03.982
I do not hang a man!

449
00:33:04.156 --> 00:33:07.550
The hand of God spreads
all across this country!

450
00:33:09.117 --> 00:33:11.641
The law hangs a man.

451
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:13.817
The law. George.

452
00:33:15.645 --> 00:33:17.560
And now you tell me

453
00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:21.303
that at least one
of these desperadoes

454
00:33:21.477 --> 00:33:26.352
will not have to suffer
the twinges of your twine.

455
00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:28.049
Heck found 'im.

456
00:33:28.223 --> 00:33:29.790
He was stuck like a pig
with a pitchfork.

457
00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:33.272
One of the Palmers got him
on the business end.

458
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:37.015
And you think
that young daughter
could've done that?

459
00:33:37.189 --> 00:33:39.495
Who knows?
Somebody did it.

460
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:40.931
But she's gone.

461
00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:43.456
And Heck.
he wants to find her

462
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.501
before something
worse happens.

463
00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:50.245
Now this Heck Thomas.
he's a-he's a renegade type.

464
00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:53.161
Would you agree
with me on that. George?

465
00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:56.251
He's frontier justice-type.
We need more of 'em.

466
00:33:56.425 --> 00:34:00.473
After we buried the bodies.
I brought the boy back.

467
00:34:00.647 --> 00:34:04.477
And Heck. he's gonna
track 'em at first light.

468
00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:07.480
A brave man.
or a foolish one.

469
00:34:07.654 --> 00:34:09.482
Or maybe
a little bit of both.

470
00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:12.224
He wants to save that girl.

471
00:34:12.398 --> 00:34:16.054
Do you really think
she's still alive. George?

472
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.231
I hope so.

473
00:34:19.405 --> 00:34:23.409
'Cause if she's not.
I'll hang 'em twice.

474
00:34:29.676 --> 00:34:31.591
-  <i>I's hungry.</i>
-  <i>Quit your bellyaching.</i>

475
00:34:31.765 --> 00:34:34.072
<i>Sit patient. Charlie'll be back
soon with some supplies.</i>

476
00:34:35.725 --> 00:34:37.423
I need
a private moment.

477
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:41.209
I need a private moment!

478
00:34:48.477 --> 00:34:49.826
Untie the bitch.

479
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.525
Let her go ahead
and do her business.

480
00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.440
And then when she's done.

481
00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:57.312
just go ahead
and tie her to that tree
over there yonder.

482
00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:59.532
Make sure you tie them knots
nice and tight.

483
00:34:59.706 --> 00:35:02.187
Don't worry yourself
none. Rufus.

484
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:04.363
She won't be going nowhere.

485
00:35:04.537 --> 00:35:06.408
- Especially if I get
on top of her.
- Wait hold on now.

486
00:35:06.582 --> 00:35:09.107
Now. now. I want to go
at her first now.

487
00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:11.065
Ya'll boys go get
some more wood
for this fire.

488
00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:13.633
- You ain't my boss.
- Hey. quit your sassin'.

489
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:17.941
We's gonna need to operate
as a tight knit unit.
we gonna raise us an army.

490
00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:19.813
And I second what he said.

491
00:35:20.944 --> 00:35:22.772
- Get to gettin'.
- Okay. all right. Rufus.

492
00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:25.819
We're goin'.
Don't you fret none.

493
00:35:34.654 --> 00:35:36.438
You ready
for your private moment?

494
00:35:49.277 --> 00:35:51.584
You thought
you was gonna get away
from us. bitch?

495
00:35:57.416 --> 00:35:59.809
God will save me!

496
00:36:01.507 --> 00:36:03.813
Ain't no God
down here with us.

497
00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:18.192
Traitor.

498
00:37:19.802 --> 00:37:21.195
He was trying
to send a telegram.

499
00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:22.805
so I nailed
the no good bastard.

500
00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:26.374
Oh. yeah? Let 'em
send that telegram.

501
00:37:26.548 --> 00:37:29.856
Let 'em spread the word
of the Rufus Buck Gang.

502
00:37:31.684 --> 00:37:35.470
Let 'em know that we got
this reign of terror
all over this town.

503
00:37:35.644 --> 00:37:37.994
We's famous now.

504
00:37:38.168 --> 00:37:40.519
They'll all be around soon.
Shouldn't we ramble?

505
00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:42.129
Let 'em send they best.

506
00:37:42.303 --> 00:37:43.957
And we gonna take
them fools out too.

507
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:46.829
And we's gonna take
this back in blood.

508
00:38:20.385 --> 00:38:22.865
Sam Sixkiller.
My old friend.

509
00:38:28.436 --> 00:38:29.872
Reckoned you'd show up. Heck.

510
00:38:31.265 --> 00:38:33.615
This man is
Corporal Paden Tolbert.

511
00:38:33.789 --> 00:38:36.488
He heard you were
in Muskogee last night.

512
00:38:36.662 --> 00:38:38.838
asking questions
about Rufus Buck.

513
00:38:39.012 --> 00:38:41.014
None of 'em
talk to strangers.

514
00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:44.060
especially <i>Mugani</i> lawmen.

515
00:38:48.108 --> 00:38:50.153
<i>Mugani</i> lawmen.

516
00:38:52.982 --> 00:38:54.593
I'll bite.

517
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.986
What in the hell
is a <i>Mugani</i> lawman?

518
00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:00.338
White man. like you.

519
00:39:02.949 --> 00:39:06.344
Tolbert. correct?
Corporal Tolbert.

520
00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:09.695
Well. you are Indian police.

521
00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:11.740
so hopefully this information

522
00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:14.569
might be of interest to you.

523
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:19.966
Rufus Buck and his gang.

524
00:39:20.183 --> 00:39:24.013
they murdered a <i>Mugani</i> lawman.
John Garrett.

525
00:39:25.711 --> 00:39:27.234
And after they killed him.

526
00:39:27.452 --> 00:39:30.672
they decided to find
two <i>Mugani</i> ranch women.

527
00:39:30.846 --> 00:39:34.197
and rape and torture 'em.

528
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:36.156
And when they were
done with 'em.

529
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:40.247
they slit the throats.
like true farm animals.

530
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:44.860
After that. they found
three <i>Mugani</i> men.

531
00:39:45.034 --> 00:39:46.296
They took one of those men.

532
00:39:46.471 --> 00:39:48.255
and they decided to hang him.

533
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:52.259
right in front
of his little <i>Mugani</i> son.

534
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:54.740
just so he could watch him die.

535
00:39:54.914 --> 00:39:59.440
So when you tell me
that the people you talk to

536
00:39:59.658 --> 00:40:02.182
don't want to talk
to a <i>Mugani</i> lawman.

537
00:40:02.356 --> 00:40:03.966
that don't surprise me.

538
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.968
What surprises me is
that the people you talk to

539
00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:08.406
wanna talk
to any lawman
of any color.

540
00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:13.236
Anyways. Sam...

541
00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:18.546
I trailed them boys
for quite a few miles

542
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.070
till the trail went cold
at Durham Creek.

543
00:40:21.244 --> 00:40:24.987
Reckon you want me
to get up a posse.
hunt 'em down?

544
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:26.902
No. I don't want
your damn posse out there

545
00:40:27.076 --> 00:40:28.817
banging around the bush.

546
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:31.211
You'd scramble these boys
from here to kingdom come.

547
00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:34.040
I'm gonna go back out.
pick up the tracks again.

548
00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:36.782
I'm gonna trail them boys
to wherever they're holed up.

549
00:40:36.956 --> 00:40:39.001
and then I'm gonna set
an ambush for 'em.

550
00:40:39.175 --> 00:40:40.829
I know you're not
the type to partner.

551
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:42.962
but I would like you
to team up with Paden here.

552
00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:45.355
That way you can vouch
for each other.

553
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.706
I don't want
a Cherokee uprising.

554
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.490
If people think those boys

555
00:40:49.664 --> 00:40:52.101
had vigilante justice
without a fair trial...

556
00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:55.061
it could get ugly.

557
00:40:55.235 --> 00:40:57.803
Things are already ugly.
Sam Sixkiller.

558
00:40:57.977 --> 00:40:59.369
And you know me.

559
00:40:59.587 --> 00:41:03.461
This old <i>Mugani</i> lawman

560
00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:06.420
- works best alone.
- Same with me.

561
00:41:06.594 --> 00:41:08.683
I could do this job
better without you.

562
00:41:08.857 --> 00:41:13.427
- You'd just get in my way.
- There we go. all settled.

563
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:18.084
Yes. it is.
Heck Thomas.

564
00:41:33.273 --> 00:41:35.144
That's a filthy habit.

565
00:41:35.318 --> 00:41:38.974
And what do you call
that damn cigar
in your hand?

566
00:41:39.148 --> 00:41:40.498
It's a prayer cigar.

567
00:41:40.672 --> 00:41:42.151
Tobacco comes
from my people.

568
00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:43.892
What about the whiskey?

569
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.285
It's from the <i>Maganis.</i>

570
00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:46.982
White man invented it

571
00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:49.158
to keep the Cherokee
from ruling the world.

572
00:41:49.332 --> 00:41:50.682
Well. I'll drink to that.

573
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.476
Sam Sixkiller
is part white.

574
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:06.480
His father was Cherokee named.
Redbird Sixkiller.

575
00:42:06.654 --> 00:42:09.178
Red got in a gunfight
with some Creeks.

576
00:42:09.352 --> 00:42:10.528
killed six.

577
00:42:11.703 --> 00:42:13.182
And they killed him.

578
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:15.881
I did not know that.
What happened then?

579
00:42:17.273 --> 00:42:18.884
His mother
couldn't handle him.

580
00:42:19.058 --> 00:42:21.582
So she sent him
to the Indian boarding school

581
00:42:21.756 --> 00:42:23.584
in Carlisle. Pennsylvania.

582
00:42:23.758 --> 00:42:26.239
And that's how
he was educated.

583
00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:27.675
Hm.

584
00:42:29.982 --> 00:42:32.506
Now. where did you
get your education?

585
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.248
I don't tell
stories of myself.

586
00:42:37.642 --> 00:42:40.819
- Only about other people?
- Only other people.

587
00:42:43.038 --> 00:42:45.475
That's the way
of a real detective.

588
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:51.481
The telegraph operator
at Western Union

589
00:42:51.656 --> 00:42:54.789
got a cutoff message
from the Army Trading Post.

590
00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:56.965
When he tried to respond.
he got nothing.

591
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:58.488
The line was dead.

592
00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:02.057
He reckoned
the wires were cut.

593
00:43:02.231 --> 00:43:04.059
What was the message
they sent?

594
00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:05.670
Army distress signal.

595
00:43:05.844 --> 00:43:07.585
The kind they use
for Indian attacks.

596
00:43:08.934 --> 00:43:10.631
All right. thank you.

597
00:43:12.459 --> 00:43:14.243
Let's hope that prayer cigar
of yours works

598
00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:16.419
and brings us
some good luck.

599
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.900
You ready to ride.
Mr. Paden Tolbert?

600
00:43:19.074 --> 00:43:22.208
Ready as you.
Mr. Heck Thomas.

601
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.091
Wishing we could've met
in church.

602
00:43:36.265 --> 00:43:38.790
We could've been
boyfriend and girlfriend.

603
00:43:38.964 --> 00:43:40.705
I'd sooner die.

604
00:43:40.879 --> 00:43:42.141
What's the matter. baby?

605
00:43:42.315 --> 00:43:43.708
You don't like Indian boys?

606
00:43:45.318 --> 00:43:47.233
I'm only 17.

607
00:43:47.407 --> 00:43:50.018
and I ain't afraid
of nobody.

608
00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:52.020
When I turn 18.

609
00:43:52.194 --> 00:43:54.022
I'll be a rich man
in the Rufus Buck Gang.

610
00:43:54.196 --> 00:43:55.937
You ain't gonna
live that long.

611
00:43:56.111 --> 00:43:57.373
You gonna get shot
or hanged.

612
00:44:01.682 --> 00:44:02.683
You mean
like your daddy did?

613
00:44:09.908 --> 00:44:12.040
You know
that's what Rufus
done to him. right?

614
00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:13.651
Strung him up real good.

615
00:44:13.825 --> 00:44:16.566
hoity-toity little brat.

616
00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:17.785
Real good.

617
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.705
- I hate you!
- Come on. baby.

618
00:44:25.837 --> 00:44:27.099
I can be nice too.

619
00:44:27.273 --> 00:44:28.709
Charles!

620
00:44:30.145 --> 00:44:31.320
Leave her be.

621
00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:33.105
She's mine. not yours.

622
00:44:37.022 --> 00:44:38.719
We's gonna have to clear out.

623
00:44:38.893 --> 00:44:40.416
Well. damn. Rufus!
What's the big hurry?

624
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.462
'Cause we gonna
need to prepare.

625
00:44:44.246 --> 00:44:46.335
Why? Because of them soldiers
in Fort Smith?

626
00:44:46.509 --> 00:44:48.424
They won't be here
till about three hours.

627
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:50.731
even on fast trail.

628
00:44:50.905 --> 00:44:52.602
And they're still gonna need
to get themselves
together first.

629
00:44:52.777 --> 00:44:54.604
All right. now. I said
we's gonna need to clear out.

630
00:44:56.302 --> 00:44:58.478
But. Rufus. don't we need
to doll up Jolene?

631
00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:00.785
- If we wanna sell her.
-  That is right.

632
00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:03.657
If we're gonna get her
all fine and. uh.

633
00:45:03.831 --> 00:45:05.311
and gussied up. then. um...

634
00:45:08.444 --> 00:45:10.185
Can I propose something. boss?

635
00:45:10.359 --> 00:45:13.841
Can't we all just take
a turn on her. once?

636
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:16.626
So she can go ahead
and be damaged goods?

637
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.152
I'll have to go ahead
and sell her cheap? Hm?

638
00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:22.763
I'm gonna let y'all know.
the man I'm gonna sell her to.

639
00:45:22.937 --> 00:45:25.331
oh. that's one bad <i>hombre.</i>

640
00:45:25.505 --> 00:45:27.507
That's Peta Nocona.

641
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:29.727
And you know how he like 'em?

642
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:31.250
He like 'em young.

643
00:45:31.424 --> 00:45:33.208
He like 'em white.

644
00:45:33.382 --> 00:45:35.645
Lucky!

645
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.996
And he like 'em virgin.

646
00:45:39.693 --> 00:45:40.738
Boss...

647
00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.872
I also like 'em that way too.

648
00:45:45.046 --> 00:45:46.439
Me too!

649
00:45:46.613 --> 00:45:47.962
That's everybody's thing.

650
00:45:50.486 --> 00:45:51.792
All right now.

651
00:45:53.315 --> 00:45:55.535
Lewis! Lewis!

652
00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:59.234
Why you look so glum.
keep downing up
all that whiskey?

653
00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:01.454
Don't you wanna
roll with us?

654
00:46:01.628 --> 00:46:03.238
Feeling guilty about some
of the innocent people
we killed.

655
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:06.851
Not all of 'em.
but some of 'em.

656
00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:09.244
God damn it. Lewis!

657
00:46:09.418 --> 00:46:11.899
There is nothing innocent
when it comes to whites.

658
00:46:14.859 --> 00:46:17.209
Did you forget?

659
00:46:17.383 --> 00:46:18.688
They stole
our land from us.

660
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.476
They murdered us
by the thousands.

661
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.999
That's not innocent.

662
00:46:25.173 --> 00:46:27.741
They're too powerful.
Rufus.

663
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:31.092
We may have our way
for a while.

664
00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:33.834
but they will hunt us down
and kill us.

665
00:46:34.008 --> 00:46:37.098
Not if we go ahead
and raise us an Indian army.

666
00:46:39.318 --> 00:46:43.278
A new generation
of fearless spirit warriors...

667
00:46:44.889 --> 00:46:47.282
who ain't afraid to die
for the Indian land.

668
00:46:47.456 --> 00:46:48.849
Preach.

669
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.809
You really think
we could scare off
all them white people. cousin?

670
00:46:56.639 --> 00:47:00.861
The only thing
that white men fear is this.

671
00:47:02.428 --> 00:47:06.780
Now. if y'all go ahead
and follow me.

672
00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:09.696
I'm gonna make y'all
kings of this new world.

673
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.524
All right?

674
00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:15.180
Anything y'all see.
anything y'all want.

675
00:47:15.354 --> 00:47:18.226
it's gonna be yours
for the taking.

676
00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:23.362
Where does the evil
of men get born?

677
00:47:23.536 --> 00:47:28.497
Jesus said he saw Satan
fall like lightning
from Heaven.

678
00:47:28.671 --> 00:47:34.286
The devil was cast down
to Earth to walk among us.

679
00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.114
What's that have
to do with anything?

680
00:47:37.593 --> 00:47:39.944
Something possessed
them young boys.

681
00:47:40.118 --> 00:47:41.684
What they done
wasn't natural.

682
00:47:42.903 --> 00:47:45.210
Unless...

683
00:47:45.384 --> 00:47:47.734
Something
gets inside of you...

684
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.826
like a parasite.

685
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.263
takes ahold of you.

686
00:47:55.437 --> 00:47:57.570
and took ahold
of their better angels.

687
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:00.703
Well. how did Heck
and Paden catch 'em?

688
00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.575
Was there some big gunfight
or something?

689
00:48:02.749 --> 00:48:03.837
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

690
00:48:05.404 --> 00:48:06.622
Easy.

691
00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:09.451
Don't get ahead
of yourself

692
00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:10.975
and get
your money's worth.

693
00:48:14.848 --> 00:48:15.893
Tommy.

694
00:48:16.981 --> 00:48:18.286
Don't be scared.

695
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:21.420
They'll never be able
to hurt you again.

696
00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:24.902
That's what I say to myself
every time I pull that lever.

697
00:48:25.076 --> 00:48:26.816
"They'll never
hurt anyone."

698
00:48:29.428 --> 00:48:31.299
What about the ones
that are still on the loose?

699
00:48:33.649 --> 00:48:35.651
You're a fine boy.

700
00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:39.177
How would you like
what happened to you

701
00:48:39.351 --> 00:48:40.787
to be told to the world?

702
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:42.658
Now. I have a writer.

703
00:48:42.832 --> 00:48:44.617
and he can publish
your story.

704
00:48:49.883 --> 00:48:51.711
They're still out
there somewhere.

705
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:53.713
Rufus Buck and his gang.

706
00:48:54.627 --> 00:48:56.542
Yeah. but...

707
00:48:56.716 --> 00:48:58.413
you'll never
see 'em alive again.

708
00:48:59.806 --> 00:49:01.155
Heck's hunting 'em down.

709
00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:04.289
They can run and hide
like rats they are.

710
00:49:04.463 --> 00:49:07.118
but what Heck
doesn't shoot...

711
00:49:08.206 --> 00:49:09.772
my ropes will get.

712
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:15.474
The thing I worry about
the most is my sister.

713
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.521
Do you think
she's still alive?

714
00:49:23.438 --> 00:49:25.484
I pray she is.

715
00:49:25.658 --> 00:49:27.660
and that Heck
will bring her back.

716
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.619
Anybody in there?

717
00:50:13.793 --> 00:50:15.925
Anybody in there?

718
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.145
U.S. Deputy Marshal
Heck Thomas!

719
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:19.625
Y'all put
your weapons down.

720
00:50:19.799 --> 00:50:21.018
come out
with your hands up.

721
00:50:21.192 --> 00:50:22.584
I promise you
a fair trial!

722
00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:51.048
My God.

723
00:51:18.945 --> 00:51:20.599
I'll keep
these reins handy

724
00:51:20.773 --> 00:51:22.470
if you want to go on
and get my medicine. darling.

725
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:25.691
Do you think it's really
doing you any good. Sam?

726
00:51:25.865 --> 00:51:27.127
I read about it.

727
00:51:27.301 --> 00:51:29.390
It's all alcohol
and paregoric.

728
00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:33.220
- Well. it helps me sleep.

729
00:51:40.749 --> 00:51:41.968
Hello?

730
00:51:43.143 --> 00:51:44.492
Mr. Foster?

731
00:51:48.453 --> 00:51:50.019
Sorry. Mary.

732
00:51:50.194 --> 00:51:54.198
I knew you were coming.
but. uh. nature called.

733
00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:58.071
I have Sam's medicine
right here.

734
00:51:58.245 --> 00:52:00.247
Seventy-five cents.
as usual.

735
00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:08.037
Sam?

736
00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:10.170
Sam!

737
00:52:20.441 --> 00:52:22.617
Hyah. hyah!

738
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:29.450
Well. as we expected.
they cut the telegraph wire.

739
00:52:29.624 --> 00:52:32.453
so we can't contact
ol' Sam Sixkiller

740
00:52:32.627 --> 00:52:34.760
to send us
some reinforcements.

741
00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:37.371
Meantime.

742
00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:40.853
let's go out here
and inspect this crime scene

743
00:52:41.027 --> 00:52:42.246
before it fades away.

744
00:52:43.769 --> 00:52:46.163
What do you see out here?

745
00:52:47.642 --> 00:52:49.470
Looks like the killers
went thataway.

746
00:52:49.644 --> 00:52:51.124
Yeah. well.
I can see that.

747
00:52:51.298 --> 00:52:52.647
But see here?

748
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:54.301
We've got a number
of horses here.

749
00:52:54.475 --> 00:52:56.999
with mounted riders.

750
00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:59.524
The other one here
looks like it's pulling
a wagon.

751
00:52:59.698 --> 00:53:00.655
You're right.

752
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:02.483
What about Jolene?

753
00:53:02.657 --> 00:53:04.006
What you reckon
happened to her?

754
00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:07.923
Maybe they're
keeping her alive
for their pleasure.

755
00:53:08.097 --> 00:53:11.536
God forbid. or holding her
for a big ransom.

756
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.973
Wouldn't put anything
past the bastards.

757
00:53:16.628 --> 00:53:18.673
Hm.

758
00:53:18.847 --> 00:53:22.721
Well. you're not defending
their renegade Injun ways.
I see.

759
00:53:22.895 --> 00:53:25.027
They ain't Indians.
they're half-breeds.

760
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:26.551
Makes 'em crazy sometimes.

761
00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:29.206
I'll have to factor that
into my figurin'.

762
00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.946
Now. who do you reckon

763
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.080
they think would pay
a big ransom for Jolene?

764
00:53:34.254 --> 00:53:35.690
Her family's
not exactly royalty.

765
00:53:35.864 --> 00:53:36.952
by the looks
of their ranch.

766
00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:38.563
What about Peta Nocona?

767
00:53:38.737 --> 00:53:41.740
The old Indian
medicine man.

768
00:53:41.914 --> 00:53:43.263
Likes 'em young.

769
00:53:43.437 --> 00:53:45.570
He'll pay for the pretty
ones. so they say.

770
00:53:45.744 --> 00:53:47.311
May well be with him.

771
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.706
You know. I've been
to his place.

772
00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:55.144
and I cannot fault you
on your detective work.

773
00:53:55.319 --> 00:53:57.538
Not by my mind. partner.

774
00:53:58.583 --> 00:54:00.149
You're my partner now?

775
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.029
Just ran into
that cracker lover.
Sammy Sixkiller.

776
00:54:10.203 --> 00:54:13.250
Did him and his old lady
right there on they wagon.

777
00:54:15.208 --> 00:54:16.688
Been waiting to do that one
a long time. boys.

778
00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:19.343
The man was a disgrace
to us Indians.

779
00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:22.215
Man. how far away
is this guy
who's gonna buy Jolene?

780
00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:23.869
Not too far.

781
00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:25.610
Off in that Creek Nation.

782
00:54:25.784 --> 00:54:27.481
Should be about 20 miles.
be there by dusk.

783
00:54:27.655 --> 00:54:29.309
So what. we just
gonna sell her to him?

784
00:54:29.483 --> 00:54:30.702
What's he gonna do
with her?

785
00:54:30.876 --> 00:54:33.574
Shit. he got
about four wives.

786
00:54:33.748 --> 00:54:36.751
He just don't like
to keep no one
when they get past they teens.

787
00:54:36.925 --> 00:54:39.276
He go ahead
and drown 'em.
skin 'em.

788
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.408
Don't even matter now.

789
00:54:41.582 --> 00:54:42.757
He just like to keep
a few of 'em around
for some work.

790
00:54:42.931 --> 00:54:44.150
Cook for him.
clean for him.

791
00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:47.675
Hey. that's all women
are good for. ain't it?

792
00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:49.024
Fuckin'.
and makin' em work.

793
00:54:53.986 --> 00:54:55.292
All right. y'all.
Saddle up.

794
00:55:02.777 --> 00:55:04.736
- Tommy!

795
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:07.347
Good to see you.
I was afraid
you weren't going to come.

796
00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:08.740
Come on in.

797
00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:13.701
My name's
Seth Crosby. Tommy.

798
00:55:20.099 --> 00:55:22.449
I write for <i>Frank Leslie's
Pictorial Newspaper</i>

799
00:55:24.886 --> 00:55:26.410
I also write dime novels.

800
00:55:27.367 --> 00:55:30.762
In fact. I'm working on one
about Mr. Maledon
as we speak.

801
00:55:30.936 --> 00:55:32.329
He told me.

802
00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:36.507
Mr. Maledon told me
what you went through.

803
00:55:37.943 --> 00:55:39.292
You're a brave young lad.

804
00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:42.077
I don't feel so.

805
00:55:44.297 --> 00:55:45.864
It's hard to get
through the nights.

806
00:55:47.387 --> 00:55:49.171
Did you talk
to your grandparents
about it?

807
00:55:50.738 --> 00:55:52.610
My grandma cries
every night.

808
00:55:54.394 --> 00:55:56.048
She tries to muffle it
in her pillow.

809
00:55:56.222 --> 00:55:59.268
but I still hear it.

810
00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:07.929
I just want to kill the people

811
00:56:08.103 --> 00:56:10.976
that killed my family
and took my sister.

812
00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:30.691
Can I help you?

813
00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:33.346
Can I help you. son?

814
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.913
Hi. there.

815
00:56:35.087 --> 00:56:36.610
We're on our way
to the Creek Nation.

816
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:39.004
Been traveling now for.
say. a day and a half.

817
00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:41.354
And we was really just hoping
that your missus

818
00:56:41.528 --> 00:56:44.270
would maybe be able
to muster us up
a warm cooked meal.

819
00:56:44.444 --> 00:56:48.100
if'n. of course.
we was to pay you $20.

820
00:56:48.274 --> 00:56:50.407
What's your name. son?

821
00:56:50.581 --> 00:56:52.713
Where are my manners?
Sheriff John Garrett.

822
00:56:52.887 --> 00:56:53.975
Indian Police.

823
00:56:54.149 --> 00:56:56.804
And these here
are my deputies.

824
00:56:56.978 --> 00:56:58.806
We got designs
on hunting down a man

825
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.027
by the name
of. oh. Rufus Buck.

826
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.202
You ever heard of him?

827
00:57:03.376 --> 00:57:05.334
We've heard of him.

828
00:57:05.509 --> 00:57:07.336
He don't operate
around here. though.

829
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.470
Yeah. we didn't
think so neither.

830
00:57:10.644 --> 00:57:13.081
We think he might be hiding off
in the Creek Nation.

831
00:57:13.255 --> 00:57:14.953
but you know. we have to take
all our provisions

832
00:57:15.127 --> 00:57:16.998
to make sure we stay
hot on his trail.

833
00:57:20.175 --> 00:57:23.440
Now. we's about half-starved
and worn out.

834
00:57:23.614 --> 00:57:26.965
Would you be able to maybe
get us up some grub?

835
00:57:27.139 --> 00:57:28.532
I can probably
rustle up something.

836
00:57:28.706 --> 00:57:31.317
Might be enough
to feed all of you.

837
00:57:31.491 --> 00:57:32.666
Except maybe
that tall one.

838
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.451
I'll check with the missus.

839
00:57:34.625 --> 00:57:36.235
see if she got
some chicken parts.

840
00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:45.679
We's gonna be
here a while. girl.

841
00:57:45.853 --> 00:57:47.638
You best not make no fuss.

842
00:57:47.812 --> 00:57:49.857
We'll kill you
and the farmer.

843
00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:51.424
All right?

844
00:57:54.122 --> 00:57:56.690
She says she's got enough.
She'll make sure
your bellies are full.

845
00:57:56.864 --> 00:57:58.431
Y'all come on in
and sit around the table.

846
00:57:58.605 --> 00:57:59.911
Make yourself at home.

847
00:58:00.085 --> 00:58:02.522
Well. sir.
we'd be much obliged.

848
00:58:02.696 --> 00:58:06.526
Mind if I ask you
for that 20 up front?

849
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.311
Oh. that'd be no problem. sir.

850
00:58:47.872 --> 00:58:49.743
How can I help you. gentlemen?

851
00:58:49.917 --> 00:58:51.745
We come
about Rufus Buck.

852
00:58:55.619 --> 00:58:57.185
Who's your Cherokee friend?

853
00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.491
That's my partner.

854
00:58:58.665 --> 00:59:00.493
Paden Tolbert.

855
00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:02.843
Tolbert.

856
00:59:04.497 --> 00:59:06.543
That's a French name.

857
00:59:06.717 --> 00:59:08.370
White man named
my great-grandfather
when he was a tracker

858
00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:11.460
in the French and Indian War.

859
00:59:11.635 --> 00:59:13.593
Following
in his footsteps. I see.

860
00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:16.857
as you track
these young ruffians
through the wilderness.

861
00:59:17.031 --> 00:59:20.034
Well. we have reason
to believe that they. uh.

862
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:23.864
kidnapped a young girl.
killed her parents.

863
00:59:24.038 --> 00:59:26.737
and we don't believe
that they're gonna ransom her.

864
00:59:26.911 --> 00:59:29.740
And what do you believe
their intentions would be?

865
00:59:29.914 --> 00:59:32.003
Maybe they think
they could sell her to you.

866
00:59:37.225 --> 00:59:39.880
I told you they were
stupid. did I not?

867
00:59:40.054 --> 00:59:43.754
Well. you did say something
to that effect. yes.

868
00:59:43.928 --> 00:59:45.407
I would not pay
for that girl.

869
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:47.801
for I would not
want to be hanged.

870
00:59:47.975 --> 00:59:50.108
Maledon will gladly
do that business.

871
00:59:50.282 --> 00:59:51.718
But how about. uh.

872
00:59:51.892 --> 00:59:54.025
you aid us
in our investigation.

873
00:59:54.199 --> 00:59:57.419
therefore putting you on the...
the right side of the law?

874
00:59:57.594 --> 00:59:58.638
Hm.

875
00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.597
Your side.

876
01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.208
The side you call the law

877
01:00:03.382 --> 01:00:05.776
is as crooked
as the criminal side.

878
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:08.692
You only dress it up
in fancy clothes.

879
01:00:08.866 --> 01:00:10.389
It's a matter of money.

880
01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:13.435
It spends both ways.
wouldn't you say?

881
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.872
Hm.

882
01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:16.569
Are you. uh.

883
01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:20.529
suggesting that we
pay you for information?

884
01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:23.620
No. No.

885
01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:25.186
Nothing that distasteful.

886
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.058
I will help you. gentlemen.

887
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.321
What information
do you have. Nocona?

888
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.063
If they're headed this way...

889
01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:37.634
they're on a rampage.
and they will rape and kill.

890
01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:39.810
Who. Mr. Medicine Man?

891
01:00:41.681 --> 01:00:43.248
The farmers of this area.

892
01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:45.990
The Patterson farm
comes to mind.

893
01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:47.687
Yeah. I know that place.

894
01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:49.689
These boys were ripped
from their parents.

895
01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:54.433
sexually abused.
as was I in my youth.

896
01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:56.087
Ain't no excuse
for what they done.

897
01:00:56.261 --> 01:00:59.612
Oh... It's not
an excuse.

898
01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:02.397
But it is...

899
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:04.399
What?

900
01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:08.142
It is the seed
of much evil.

901
01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:17.543
That's a mighty
fine meal. Ms. Ellie.

902
01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.588
We're much obliged.

903
01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:22.896
We need us all our energy

904
01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:24.593
- to go ahead and chase down
them bad guys.
-  Mm-hm.

905
01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.813
And Rufus Buck is
one of the worst.

906
01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:34.255
Now. I'm curious about
something. Mr. Spencer.

907
01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:36.518
Pray tell.

908
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.651
how did you get to own
this little piece
of property here?

909
01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:41.088
My parents left it
to us. me and Ellie.

910
01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:44.004
And we built a cabin
down there by the way.

911
01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:46.093
so we can help 'em
work the fields.

912
01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:48.400
So now we just keep
the cabin for guests.

913
01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:49.923
and we moved in here.

914
01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:52.709
Well.
ain't that sweet.

915
01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:55.624
Well. we get by.
but it takes a whole lot
of hard work.

916
01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.061
Hm.

917
01:01:57.235 --> 01:02:00.542
Now. I can't help
but wonder.

918
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.241
how did your mom and daddy
own the farm? Hm?

919
01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:05.852
Who'd they pay for it?

920
01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.506
We didn't pay
anybody for it.

921
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.334
When the territory opened up.

922
01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:12.946
you know. settlers
came out. took land.

923
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.209
make something of themselves.

924
01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:17.472
Hard work.

925
01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:20.911
That kind of opportunity.
it doesn't exist back East.

926
01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:24.088
Ain't it bother you none.
or your pappy.

927
01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:26.264
that this was
already Native land?

928
01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:31.443
To be honest. we never
really thought about it.

929
01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:36.404
You know? The government
makes the law.
not the Indians.

930
01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:38.580
Besides.
they wasn't working it.

931
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.931
They was just letting it
go to waste.

932
01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:43.760
We didn't do anything wrong.
and neither did
my husband's parents.

933
01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:46.632
Everything they did
was fair and legal.

934
01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:48.155
By whose laws?

935
01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:52.072
Indians got laws.
Indians got ways.

936
01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:55.902
The way I see it.
this land is stolen.

937
01:02:56.076 --> 01:02:58.949
Yeah. the whole thing
vexes me.

938
01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:00.777
Shouldn't be this way.
Rufus.

939
01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:04.911
- I mean. Sheriff Garrett.

940
01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:16.009
Let's get on up
out of here. Rufus.

941
01:03:16.183 --> 01:03:18.316
We may not have much time.

942
01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:22.624
Let's negotiate.

943
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:26.367
Now. that was a mighty
fine meal. Ms. Ellie.

944
01:03:27.934 --> 01:03:31.068
But food is only one
of the animal urges.

945
01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:35.942
So let's go ahead
and say $20 for the meal...

946
01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:40.468
and how about $3
for our other appetites?

947
01:03:40.642 --> 01:03:42.601
You're crazy!

948
01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:44.821
She's not gonna
let you violate her.
and neither am I!

949
01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:46.431
Why?

950
01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:48.999
Don't you like the price?

951
01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:53.960
What if we go ahead
and up it by two bits?

952
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:55.788
Now Ellie.

953
01:03:55.962 --> 01:03:59.705
this is your chance
to save your husband's life.

954
01:03:59.879 --> 01:04:02.316
Now.
we giving you
a choice.

955
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.971
and that's a whole
lot more than we got

956
01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:06.755
when our land was stolen.

957
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:10.063
women raped.
children killed.

958
01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:11.891
We had nothing
to do with that!

959
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.980
That's 1.000 years ago.

960
01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:16.765
Now y'all keep
calling me crazy.

961
01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.073
but can't you see
that I'm the one
in control here?

962
01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:23.511
Or is you just too stupid
to see that. farmer?

963
01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:27.428
It's plain. I'll do
whatever it takes
to save our lives.

964
01:04:27.602 --> 01:04:30.431
Now that's most sensible.
Ms. Ellie.

965
01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.565
And if you gots to do it.
you might as well enjoy.

966
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.570
You only get in
what you put in.

967
01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:40.093
Now ain't that right. boys?

968
01:04:40.267 --> 01:04:42.269
-  Yeah.
-  That's right.

969
01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:44.358
I don't want
no sloppy seconds. Rufus.

970
01:04:44.532 --> 01:04:46.578
- Hush up.
-  How about. uh...

971
01:04:46.752 --> 01:04:48.841
we draw for it?

972
01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:50.712
High card wins.
Lewis?

973
01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:08.556
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Got me a ace.

974
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.036
I know y'all boys
can't beat that.

975
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.169
Now that ain't fair!
He's just a kid.

976
01:05:16.173 --> 01:05:17.609
King.

977
01:05:17.783 --> 01:05:19.132
I guess I'll go second.

978
01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:22.744
Now you see
how diplomatic I is. boy?

979
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.356
Lowly six.

980
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.053
I'm lower than that.
I got a three.

981
01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:28.968
That's too bad.

982
01:05:29.142 --> 01:05:31.188
Go ahead now. Charles.

983
01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:33.799
Didn't I tell you
you'd be doing good
once you joined us?

984
01:05:33.973 --> 01:05:35.844
Come on. girl.

985
01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:37.237
- Oh. hey!

986
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:38.891
You're all going to hell!

987
01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:42.025
And I tell you this.
you better kill me.

988
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.682
- Girl. get in there.
- And be quick.

989
01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.728
'cause these boys
are hankerin'.

990
01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:51.686
Oh. yeah!

991
01:05:54.124 --> 01:05:55.821
Don't try nothing funny now.

992
01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:58.432
Do as I say.
and we'll let you live.
okay. honey?

993
01:05:58.606 --> 01:06:00.043
And don't you worry none.

994
01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:02.610
I'm real good.
You're gonna enjoy it.

995
01:06:02.784 --> 01:06:04.264
Stop all that crying.

996
01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.400
We start young
with our squaws. okay?

997
01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:10.967
- Don't worry about it.

998
01:06:14.361 --> 01:06:15.972
Nothing funny now.
Stop it.

999
01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:18.670
This will be fun.

1000
01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:24.937
Stop it!

1001
01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:27.505
Stop it.

1002
01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:33.685
Stop it.

1003
01:06:38.472 --> 01:06:39.647
Ow!

1004
01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:47.307
- Come on.

1005
01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:52.573
- Ow!
- Shh!

1006
01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:57.013
Slowly. slowly.
Slowly.

1007
01:06:58.579 --> 01:06:59.711
Mm.

1008
01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:03.280
- Like that?

1009
01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:08.676
Mm.

1010
01:07:15.118 --> 01:07:16.075
Here.

1011
01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:35.616
Mm.

1012
01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:37.749
Yeah...

1013
01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.273
Shh...

1014
01:08:23.838 --> 01:08:25.275
Come on. boy.

1015
01:08:25.449 --> 01:08:27.494
Come on. quiet.
quiet. quiet. quiet.

1016
01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:33.021
Sorry. boys.

1017
01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:35.154
Lady Luck rides with me again!

1018
01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.549
Come on.

1019
01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:43.989
<i>Ellie and Jolene
made a break for it.</i>

1020
01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:46.252
with the lawmen
tracking them boys

1021
01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:49.821
through Indian territory.
where borders blur

1022
01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:52.867
between civilized lands
and wilderness...

1023
01:08:54.391 --> 01:08:57.829
and men's morals
can blur just the same

1024
01:08:58.003 --> 01:09:01.224
in the ruthless
and unforgiving outlands.

1025
01:09:03.095 --> 01:09:04.096
Marshal!

1026
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.622
Marshal! Marshal!

1027
01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.408
I'm Ellie Patterson.

1028
01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:12.626
They killed my husband.
they tried to rape me.

1029
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.758
and I got away.

1030
01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:15.194
Where are they?

1031
01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:16.891
They're at the house.

1032
01:09:17.065 --> 01:09:18.632
They're a bunch
of half-breeds.

1033
01:09:18.806 --> 01:09:21.157
He said his name
was Sheriff Garrett.

1034
01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:23.159
Who is this girl?

1035
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:26.640
I'm Jolene Palmer.
They killed my mom.
my family.

1036
01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:28.686
They done kept me for days
against my will

1037
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.253
- until she came.
- All right.
listen to me. girl.

1038
01:09:30.427 --> 01:09:32.080
You get her in town now.
go see the doctor.

1039
01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.430
You fly like the wind.
you hear me?

1040
01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.127
- Yes. sir.
- Go!

1041
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:42.090
This ends now.

1042
01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.794
Hey. come on now. Charlie.

1043
01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:52.405
These boys are waiting.
Hurry it on up.

1044
01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:54.364
-  Come on!

1045
01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:55.452
Let's see 'im!

1046
01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:12.120
<i>All right now.
Charlie.</i>

1047
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.559
Come on now.
your time's up.

1048
01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.004
That bitch!

1049
01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:27.658
Hey. she getting away!

1050
01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:31.575
- U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas!

1051
01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:32.924
You're under arrest!

1052
01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:37.363
All y'all boys
take position!

1053
01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:39.409
Get to a window!
To a window!

1054
01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:42.977
You want peace?

1055
01:10:45.066 --> 01:10:46.154
Come and get it!

1056
01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:56.643
- Hey! I want to talk to you!
- Come on!

1057
01:10:56.817 --> 01:10:59.124
- Huh?
- Come on. you dumb shit!

1058
01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:03.781
You can fight and die here.

1059
01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:05.739
or you can surrender
and go back in shackles

1060
01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:07.611
and face justice. boys.

1061
01:11:11.179 --> 01:11:12.268
Fuck me!

1062
01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:13.791
Till you've been
in a shootout.

1063
01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:16.010
you'll never know
what it's like.

1064
01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:19.013
Your senses
go into a haze.

1065
01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:23.714
It's like time stops.
and you enter a dream state.

1066
01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:27.413
Anything's possible
in that world--

1067
01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:30.460
Feats of daring
or disgrace.

1068
01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:35.029
Hard men
maintain their focus.

1069
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.251
where the rest
die like dogs.

1070
01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:43.081
Stop firing. God damn it!
You're wasting bullets.

1071
01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:45.213
So are they.

1072
01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:46.737
We gotta keep 'em
pinned down in that house.
all right?

1073
01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:48.782
They're gonna run
out of ammunition.

1074
01:11:48.956 --> 01:11:50.784
So I need you--
listen to me!
Listen. God damn it!

1075
01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.830
Work your way
around the backside.

1076
01:11:53.004 --> 01:11:54.571
so you can cover
the back of the house.
You got me?

1077
01:11:56.224 --> 01:11:57.791
- Do you hear me?
- Great plan.

1078
01:11:57.965 --> 01:11:58.792
as long as I don't
get killed in the meantime.

1079
01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.970
I told you you'd
be good at dime novels. Heck.

1080
01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:04.668
How'd you know
we was out here?

1081
01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.452
I stopped
at Peta Nocona's.

1082
01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:09.673
I thought
your lumbago was bad.

1083
01:12:09.847 --> 01:12:11.196
It is.

1084
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.459
I got some sad news for you.

1085
01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:15.548
Sam Sixkiller
and his wife were killed.

1086
01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:18.072
I believe by the Rufus Gang.

1087
01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:20.597
- Where?
- In Muskogee.

1088
01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:26.559
The ones
that killed him

1089
01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.518
are inside the house
shooting at us.

1090
01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:30.824
- I'll cover the back.
-  I got you.

1091
01:12:38.136 --> 01:12:40.747
- So. what do we do now?
- I got a plan.

1092
01:12:42.706 --> 01:12:44.925
One of us re-directs shots.

1093
01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.884
Two of 'em go pick 'em out.

1094
01:12:47.058 --> 01:12:48.886
while the other two
slip out the back.

1095
01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.409
How about one of us
keeps 'em pinned

1096
01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:51.715
while three get away?

1097
01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:56.197
- Get away where?
-  Into the forest!

1098
01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:57.764
Anywhere they ain't!

1099
01:12:57.938 --> 01:12:59.200
We'll do like Custer
and his men did.

1100
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.551
Custer?! What's so good
about Custer?

1101
01:13:01.725 --> 01:13:02.856
That bitch!

1102
01:13:03.553 --> 01:13:05.206
They kept their last bullet
to they own selves.

1103
01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.469
when they couldn't do no more.

1104
01:13:06.643 --> 01:13:08.949
They blew they own brains out.

1105
01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:13.084
Custer's lieutenants
just didn't wanna
be tortured.

1106
01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:15.782
Them boys ain't
stand for nothing.

1107
01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:17.393
They ain't wanna face
no punishment.

1108
01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:18.437
Would you?

1109
01:13:20.178 --> 01:13:22.441
White man.
he ain't gonna torture.

1110
01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:24.617
He think
he more civilized than us.

1111
01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:30.536
So. what will they do?

1112
01:13:33.017 --> 01:13:34.061
They gonna put us on trial.

1113
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.977
And that's when we can
defend ourself.

1114
01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:40.328
Let the whole world know
what we did and why for.

1115
01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:43.984
We gon' probably go ahead
and get the rope...

1116
01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:47.466
but they might just be
soft-hearted.

1117
01:13:54.908 --> 01:13:57.476
By and by.

1118
01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:00.305
We all knew
it had to come to this.

1119
01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.612
Chips been stacked
against us.

1120
01:14:02.786 --> 01:14:04.918
And it's been that way
our whole lives.

1121
01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:11.577
It's been a pleasure
rolling with you boys.

1122
01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.188
Hey. hey. hey. Now.
what are you
talking about. Rufus?

1123
01:14:14.362 --> 01:14:17.540
All right. Are you--
Are you trying
to cash in on us?

1124
01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:20.107
What about all that talk
about us raising an Indian army?

1125
01:14:20.281 --> 01:14:22.675
You said we were gonna
raise an Indian army.
What about--

1126
01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:27.463
Y'all was it. my brothers.

1127
01:14:38.778 --> 01:14:41.215
We might as well be
ready to call it the end.

1128
01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:48.309
Unless somebody wanted
to go head on out there.

1129
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.660
and distract them lawmen.

1130
01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:52.531
while the rest of us.

1131
01:14:52.705 --> 01:14:54.141
we make it out
through the back.

1132
01:14:58.363 --> 01:15:00.234
It'd be my honor. Rufus.

1133
01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:02.367
Lewis...

1134
01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:10.549
You give 'em hell. okay?

1135
01:15:10.723 --> 01:15:12.508
Tell mama I love her.

1136
01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:19.558
I tip my hat
to the Rufus Buck Gang.

1137
01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:46.629
If you want to surrender.

1138
01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:48.761
you put your guns down.

1139
01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.590
and you come out
with your hands
where I can see 'em.

1140
01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:54.332
We ain't fools!
You'll gun us down!

1141
01:15:54.506 --> 01:15:56.769
Not if you're
surrendering.
you dumb shit!

1142
01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:00.425
I'm U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas.

1143
01:16:00.599 --> 01:16:02.558
and my word means something.

1144
01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:14.004
Come out!

1145
01:16:19.183 --> 01:16:21.664
Paden. you stay on the back!

1146
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.453
Come on!

1147
01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:30.760
Come on. you simple
son of a bitch. Come on!

1148
01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.116
Where's the rest of your boys?

1149
01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.340
Surprise. surprise.

1150
01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:48.995
You watch him. George.

1151
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:53.652
Don't you move.

1152
01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:56.133
You got
a good neck to stretch.

1153
01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.800
- They all come out?
- Yes.

1154
01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:22.202
I'm getting
real low on ammo. Rufus.

1155
01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:24.814
We ain't gonna need much ammo
for what I got in store.

1156
01:17:24.988 --> 01:17:27.425
Now. let's put
some pep up on our steps.

1157
01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:29.427
Put some space between us
and them boys. all right?

1158
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:31.734
- All right?
- Okay. Come on. let's go.

1159
01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:50.927
We've got
two sets of tracks here.

1160
01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:52.537
A single set here.

1161
01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:55.496
looks like you have two
or three on this side

1162
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.499
Let's split up.
You'll take on that track.
I'll take on this track.

1163
01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:14.124
Howdy there. Marshal.

1164
01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:17.388
Go ahead
and turn around for me.

1165
01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:19.651
Real molasses-like.

1166
01:18:23.394 --> 01:18:26.049
Woo-hoo!
Slow down now.

1167
01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:28.051
Go ahead and drop
that gun for me.

1168
01:18:29.313 --> 01:18:32.359
Now you heard me.
I said go ahead
and toss that rifle.

1169
01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:40.846
That piece too.

1170
01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:47.723
While you're at it.
go ahead and toss
that buck knife.

1171
01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:53.467
I ain't gonna strip you naked.
don't you worry none.

1172
01:18:56.906 --> 01:18:58.908
- Appreciate you.

1173
01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:05.305
Ah.
the great Heck Thomas!

1174
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:10.702
To get
little old Rufus Buck.

1175
01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:13.705
You done brought
more men in to hang
than anybody

1176
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.533
off in this Indian
territory.

1177
01:19:15.707 --> 01:19:17.187
I am honored.

1178
01:19:20.146 --> 01:19:24.368
And I give
every single one of 'em
the chance to surrender.

1179
01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:27.327
just like I'm giving
you now. Rufus Buck.

1180
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.199
Oh. is that right?

1181
01:19:29.373 --> 01:19:31.244
That's right.

1182
01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:35.553
Damn it.
only one bullet left.

1183
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.731
Son of a bitch!
Hey! Sam!

1184
01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.646
- You okay? Okay.
- Yeah. I'm good. Lucky.

1185
01:19:44.605 --> 01:19:45.868
You mine. boy.

1186
01:19:47.304 --> 01:19:48.348
Remember the name Lucky.

1187
01:19:48.522 --> 01:19:50.655
- Lucky!

1188
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:58.489
Drop it. boy!

1189
01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.317
Or I'll drop you.

1190
01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:08.934
Death or justice. huh?

1191
01:20:09.108 --> 01:20:10.980
Your choice.

1192
01:20:11.154 --> 01:20:12.459
It seems like you
just gonna have
to be remembered

1193
01:20:12.633 --> 01:20:14.331
as a man
who gets done in
by Rufus Buck.

1194
01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:17.551
And you gonna be remembered
as a murdering coward.

1195
01:20:17.725 --> 01:20:20.990
raper and torturer
of women and children.

1196
01:20:21.164 --> 01:20:23.819
All for what. son?
The color of their skin?

1197
01:20:25.559 --> 01:20:28.084
The same as your people
done did to us!

1198
01:20:28.258 --> 01:20:31.783
All we done was brought y'all
civilization and opportunity.

1199
01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:34.655
You can't stop progress. son.

1200
01:20:40.096 --> 01:20:42.576
Well. it looks like
I'm just gonna have
to stop progress.

1201
01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.672
Paden!

1202
01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.283
I think you better
go help your partner.

1203
01:20:53.457 --> 01:20:56.373
I'll take care
of these buckos.

1204
01:21:03.597 --> 01:21:05.469
Go for it.
Go for it. son!

1205
01:21:06.426 --> 01:21:07.863
How fast are you?

1206
01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:09.952
If you think you're
fast enough. go for it.

1207
01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:21.615
Glad you could finally
make it. partner.

1208
01:21:21.789 --> 01:21:23.879
I see you got yourself
a little puppet.

1209
01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:25.619
He's a good little Injun.

1210
01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:27.795
Do you take
all your orders from him?

1211
01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:30.711
You done pledged
allegiance to they flag.

1212
01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.757
homage to Indian police?

1213
01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:35.455
That white man don't care
none about you.

1214
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:37.588
That man don't care
for you none.

1215
01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.504
I can start us up again.

1216
01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:42.462
I'll bring us back.

1217
01:21:42.636 --> 01:21:44.943
Our culture.
our land. our tongue.

1218
01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:47.903
I promise you.
I promise you!

1219
01:21:48.077 --> 01:21:49.295
I'll start us up a revolution.

1220
01:21:49.469 --> 01:21:51.471
You listen
to that white man.

1221
01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:53.430
he ain't gonna do nothing
but take. take.
take from you.

1222
01:21:53.604 --> 01:21:55.040
I just need you to do
one thing for me now.

1223
01:21:55.214 --> 01:21:57.390
Just one thing for me.

1224
01:21:58.391 --> 01:22:00.959
Kill that white man.
You hear me?

1225
01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:02.439
Do you hear me?

1226
01:22:04.093 --> 01:22:05.442
Kill that white man.

1227
01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:06.617
Kill that white man!

1228
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.532
Kill that white man right now!

1229
01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:13.406
Cannot do that.

1230
01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.060
You murdered my friend.

1231
01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:17.410
Your gang
will face justice.

1232
01:22:19.325 --> 01:22:21.371
<i>Man's gotta decide one day</i>

1233
01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:25.592
that he's gotta rise
above the level of animal.

1234
01:22:25.766 --> 01:22:28.030
Not that animals are bad.

1235
01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:32.773
they have a purity
in their instincts.
But man...

1236
01:22:34.601 --> 01:22:36.995
A man can touch
the face of God.

1237
01:22:37.169 --> 01:22:41.695
and live on
in that supernatural
presence.

1238
01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:44.960
Takes a lot of death
to see it all that way.

1239
01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:47.658
And believe me.

1240
01:22:47.832 --> 01:22:51.749
I've seen it all.
with a shovel in my hand.

1241
01:22:53.577 --> 01:22:54.665
But how does it end?

1242
01:22:54.839 --> 01:22:55.883
Couldn't say.

1243
01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.451
I'm not the Reaper.

1244
01:22:58.625 --> 01:23:00.758
I'm just a simple
gravedigger.

1245
01:23:00.932 --> 01:23:03.195
with a taste
for fine cognac.

1246
01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:06.242
For the people in the story.
not for me.

1247
01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:08.070
We're just dying to know.

1248
01:23:08.244 --> 01:23:12.900
In one man's story
is every man's story.

1249
01:23:13.075 --> 01:23:15.251
Remember that. stranger.

1250
01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:18.341
Only the grave
remains undefeated.

1251
01:23:18.515 --> 01:23:21.692
and it keeps me
in business.

1252
01:23:21.866 --> 01:23:24.434
But I've seen
all their ghosts.

1253
01:23:24.608 --> 01:23:26.653
6and I'll tell you...

1254
01:23:28.177 --> 01:23:31.006
which one
met their maker first.

1255
01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:43.888
All right. listen up!

1256
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.586
I know you want justice.

1257
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.414
And you want justice now.

1258
01:23:48.588 --> 01:23:50.503
Yeah!

1259
01:23:50.677 --> 01:23:52.940
But that ain't the way
the law works.
and you know it.

1260
01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:54.507
Uh. Sheriff.

1261
01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:57.206
The law don't work
too well up here.

1262
01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.164
But I'm willing to bet

1263
01:23:59.338 --> 01:24:02.341
this rope here
works just fine.

1264
01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:04.387
- Ain't gonna happen. partner.

1265
01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:05.910
It ain't the way
it's gonna happen.

1266
01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:08.173
Says who. Sheriff?

1267
01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:15.311
Don't make me
shoot you. mister.

1268
01:24:18.923 --> 01:24:20.446
Sheriff. you know
just as well as I do

1269
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.188
those boys in that cell.
they need to hang!

1270
01:24:23.362 --> 01:24:25.234
They need to hang tonight.
and you know it.

1271
01:24:25.408 --> 01:24:29.629
What I know is
the man on my right
is George Maledon.

1272
01:24:30.456 --> 01:24:31.718
The hangman!

1273
01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:39.117
Judge Parker's right hand
for fittin' neckties.

1274
01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:44.209
Now. George and I hunted hard
to bring these killers in

1275
01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:45.863
so they could face justice.

1276
01:24:47.604 --> 01:24:51.260
And as God as my witness.
we will see justice done.

1277
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.135
We're taking these boys
to Fort Smith tomorrow.

1278
01:24:57.309 --> 01:25:00.095
so they can face
Judge Parker.

1279
01:25:01.487 --> 01:25:03.141
And anybody.

1280
01:25:03.315 --> 01:25:06.666
any one of you sons of bitches
tries to stop us.

1281
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.451
you're gonna face
the same brand of punishment

1282
01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:11.584
that these boys
are about to face.

1283
01:25:11.758 --> 01:25:13.020
Now these boys are gonna be

1284
01:25:13.195 --> 01:25:14.631
on that prison train
tomorrow at noon.

1285
01:25:14.805 --> 01:25:16.415
Now go on. get.

1286
01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:18.548
Go home.

1287
01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:21.028
- Get!

1288
01:25:23.596 --> 01:25:25.163
Go on!

1289
01:25:25.337 --> 01:25:27.731
You got no business
here no more.

1290
01:25:27.905 --> 01:25:30.603
You take your rope
with you. mister. go ahead.

1291
01:25:34.564 --> 01:25:36.392
Those sons of bitches.

1292
01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:58.501
- And what business
are you about?

1293
01:25:58.675 --> 01:25:59.719
Heck.

1294
01:25:59.893 --> 01:26:01.678
We got a story to tell.

1295
01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:03.680
That's the writer
I told you about.

1296
01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:05.290
Let him in.

1297
01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:09.120
From what I hear.

1298
01:26:09.294 --> 01:26:11.340
you boys don't have much
going for you
in the way of a defense.

1299
01:26:11.514 --> 01:26:13.298
So this is your chance

1300
01:26:13.472 --> 01:26:14.952
to tell your side
of the story.
if you'd like.

1301
01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:16.475
You're the leader. right?

1302
01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:21.132
Rufus Buck.
of the infamous Rufus Buck Gang.

1303
01:26:21.306 --> 01:26:25.005
That's right.
I'm him.

1304
01:26:26.746 --> 01:26:30.576
Great commander and martyr
of the next uprising.

1305
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.187
Is that what this
was all about?

1306
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:35.277
A freedom movement
of some sort?

1307
01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:37.931
Well. it's my name
that you sellin' them books
and papers on. right?

1308
01:26:38.105 --> 01:26:40.107
I'm Rufus Buck.

1309
01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:42.849
so I guess it's all about
whatever I say it is.

1310
01:26:44.677 --> 01:26:48.464
Yes. Mr. Buck.
That is a salient point.

1311
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:54.600
Plus. you want to be
well remembered. right?

1312
01:26:54.774 --> 01:26:56.341
Yeah.

1313
01:26:56.515 --> 01:26:58.387
<i>Frank Leslie's
Pictorial Newspaper</i>

1314
01:26:58.561 --> 01:27:00.737
is the best place
to see to that.

1315
01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:05.350
Jesse James was
a stone cold killer.

1316
01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:07.352
- Jesse James?
- The Jesse James.

1317
01:27:07.526 --> 01:27:09.049
But we cleaned up his image.

1318
01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:12.488
and now he is
a Confederate hero

1319
01:27:12.662 --> 01:27:14.359
who was wrongly accused.

1320
01:27:14.533 --> 01:27:16.100
Jesse James.

1321
01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.103
George.

1322
01:27:19.277 --> 01:27:21.105
Just so you know.

1323
01:27:22.498 --> 01:27:25.501
Paden and I. we ain't coming
to Fort Smith with you
on the train tomorrow.

1324
01:27:28.852 --> 01:27:30.549
You know I ain't partial
to courtrooms.

1325
01:27:30.723 --> 01:27:32.464
We're gonna stay
right here in Muskogee.

1326
01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:35.250
Well. Heck...

1327
01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:39.297
I appreciate
all you've done for us.

1328
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:42.779
- Anytime. old partner.
- Yeah.

1329
01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:49.612
Do you think the viciousness
you boys experienced
during childhood

1330
01:27:49.786 --> 01:27:50.830
caused you to go astray?

1331
01:27:51.004 --> 01:27:52.397
Well. I mean.

1332
01:27:52.571 --> 01:27:55.922
our...
our daddy was way worse.

1333
01:27:56.096 --> 01:27:58.403
Uh. way worse
than them Indian schools.

1334
01:27:58.577 --> 01:28:00.318
Our daddy was. uh.

1335
01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:01.798
well. he was probably
the meanest man

1336
01:28:01.972 --> 01:28:03.408
in the whole wide world.

1337
01:28:03.582 --> 01:28:05.323
Yeah. you'd think
being a freed slave

1338
01:28:05.497 --> 01:28:07.412
would cure him
of that curse.

1339
01:28:07.586 --> 01:28:10.372
but he mainly
just took it out
on me and my brother.

1340
01:28:10.546 --> 01:28:13.679
and my mama.
who was also Creek.

1341
01:28:13.853 --> 01:28:15.028
You gonna write that in?

1342
01:28:15.202 --> 01:28:16.856
- Yes.
- Okay.

1343
01:28:18.205 --> 01:28:20.512
What about you. Mr. Buck?

1344
01:28:20.686 --> 01:28:24.995
It is your story
as the leader
of this revolution

1345
01:28:25.169 --> 01:28:27.606
our readers most
want to learn about.

1346
01:28:34.483 --> 01:28:36.093
My ma. my pa?

1347
01:28:37.486 --> 01:28:38.704
Wasn't nothing like theirs.

1348
01:28:40.271 --> 01:28:42.229
There was no mean bone
in they body.

1349
01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.799
My mama Black.
daddy a Creek.

1350
01:28:48.018 --> 01:28:51.282
And they loved their little
simple life at the tribe.

1351
01:28:51.456 --> 01:28:53.763
I ain't seen
nothing wrong with it

1352
01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:56.113
till I got a little older.

1353
01:28:56.287 --> 01:28:59.072
I saw what y'all been
doing to our people...

1354
01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:03.250
and I started to hate
my mama and daddy

1355
01:29:03.425 --> 01:29:05.470
for being so damn weak.

1356
01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:07.690
Trying to be
like y'all white folk.

1357
01:29:07.864 --> 01:29:11.520
They told me stories
about how the Indians
freely roamed the land.

1358
01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:14.392
and how there was
millions of buffalo.

1359
01:29:14.566 --> 01:29:17.656
When I asked them
what happened
to all them buffalo...

1360
01:29:19.528 --> 01:29:22.748
they told me that the paleface
done killed them all.

1361
01:29:24.446 --> 01:29:29.581
And with no buffalo
wasn't gonna be no Indian.

1362
01:29:29.755 --> 01:29:32.584
Ain't got no buffalo
to hunt. to eat.

1363
01:29:32.758 --> 01:29:34.412
no buffalo for us
to make our leather.

1364
01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:36.893
so we got
our clothes and shelter.

1365
01:29:37.067 --> 01:29:40.113
And that be just one reason
why I hate y'all.

1366
01:29:45.641 --> 01:29:48.861
But you fellas
didn't just kill
white people.

1367
01:29:49.035 --> 01:29:52.082
Other Indians were
your victims as well.

1368
01:29:52.256 --> 01:29:54.258
Them boys was fighting
on the other side.

1369
01:30:03.702 --> 01:30:06.401
It's just kinda like something
just possessed us. is all.

1370
01:30:06.575 --> 01:30:08.664
Some kind of evil spirit.

1371
01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:12.755
Is this a different spirit
than the Great Spirit
you spoke of?

1372
01:30:12.929 --> 01:30:15.410
Could be.
Or you know what?

1373
01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:17.455
It could just be
that devil person

1374
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:20.153
y'all Bible people
keep talking about.

1375
01:30:20.327 --> 01:30:22.286
The one they taught about
in the Indian school?

1376
01:30:23.896 --> 01:30:25.724
What happened to you
at the Indian school?

1377
01:30:25.898 --> 01:30:27.900
Don't you worry
none about that.

1378
01:30:28.074 --> 01:30:31.208
Same thing happened to me
is happening to them boys.

1379
01:30:31.382 --> 01:30:33.515
But that is the origin
of all this evil.

1380
01:30:33.689 --> 01:30:35.952
To hell
with your origin story.

1381
01:30:37.649 --> 01:30:40.478
I hate all y'all
for not allowing this world

1382
01:30:40.652 --> 01:30:43.960
to be the way
the Great Spirit
intended it to be.

1383
01:30:44.134 --> 01:30:46.615
And how did he
intend it to be?

1384
01:30:46.789 --> 01:30:50.227
A place where my daddy
got to roam free.

1385
01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:52.577
a place where my mama
wasn't in no chains

1386
01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:55.450
and a place where you stayed
your ass right back
where you belong!

1387
01:31:07.026 --> 01:31:07.940
Did you get what you need?

1388
01:31:08.114 --> 01:31:09.594
Yes. sir. I did.

1389
01:31:09.768 --> 01:31:10.639
Good.

1390
01:31:12.641 --> 01:31:14.643
Told you
I'd make you famous.

1391
01:31:24.566 --> 01:31:27.220
Well. I don't know. boys but...

1392
01:31:28.657 --> 01:31:30.615
I think he ate up
that story. hook. line. sinker!

1393
01:31:30.789 --> 01:31:32.574
- Whoo!

1394
01:31:33.575 --> 01:31:36.055
We's gonna be famous. huh?

1395
01:31:37.622 --> 01:31:38.928
What about you. Rufus?

1396
01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:42.540
You don't really
give a damn
about that buffalo

1397
01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:44.455
and Great Spirit talk. right?

1398
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:47.153
I wouldn't know no buffalo
from no bull. man.

1399
01:31:51.288 --> 01:31:53.420
And I ain't even sure
about no Great Spirit.

1400
01:31:55.074 --> 01:31:57.686
Same way that white man
can't be sure about no God.

1401
01:31:59.383 --> 01:32:01.298
But if there is one.

1402
01:32:01.472 --> 01:32:03.474
how could they let us
get away with all
that we did?

1403
01:32:03.648 --> 01:32:06.259
We didn't get away
with it all. did we?

1404
01:32:10.568 --> 01:32:12.483
Hey. Rufus.

1405
01:32:12.657 --> 01:32:14.833
Do you think our story's gonna
make any difference in court?

1406
01:32:19.664 --> 01:32:20.709
Not a lick.

1407
01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:24.843
But we's going
have us a story

1408
01:32:25.017 --> 01:32:26.715
for when we dead
and buried.

1409
01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:32.068
<i>I should not expect
a happily ever. then.</i>

1410
01:32:32.242 --> 01:32:33.635
No. friend.

1411
01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:36.028
Tales like this
don't end pretty.

1412
01:32:36.202 --> 01:32:39.728
Not like. uh. them
in the dime novels.

1413
01:32:39.902 --> 01:32:41.773
with the fancy shootouts

1414
01:32:41.947 --> 01:32:46.343
in between the advertisement
for cigars and soap.

1415
01:32:46.517 --> 01:32:49.346
Justice may be blind.

1416
01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:53.176
but she's a cold ass bitch
to the man in chain.

1417
01:32:53.393 --> 01:32:54.786
<i>Let's go. boys.</i>

1418
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.483
Keep up.

1419
01:33:09.496 --> 01:33:10.759
Told
the townsfolk noon.

1420
01:33:10.933 --> 01:33:12.630
but it's a six a.m. train.

1421
01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:16.939
Maybe that train just ain't
gonna be coming. old man.

1422
01:33:20.638 --> 01:33:23.510
- Right on time.

1423
01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:37.437
Neither Tommy Palmer
nor Jolene Palmer

1424
01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.135
will be testifying
in court.

1425
01:33:39.309 --> 01:33:40.963
Why not?

1426
01:33:41.137 --> 01:33:43.008
Tommy saw them
lynch his father.

1427
01:33:43.182 --> 01:33:45.402
Jolene saw them rape
and kill her mother.

1428
01:33:45.576 --> 01:33:47.056
Yep.

1429
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:48.797
The death penalty
would be a sure thing.

1430
01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:50.189
Yeah. you'd think.

1431
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:53.453
Prosecutors decided
to try them boys first

1432
01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.718
for the rape
of Ms. Rosetta Hassan.

1433
01:33:56.892 --> 01:33:58.458
Happened
about three weeks ago.

1434
01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:01.548
Carries the same death
penalty as killing.

1435
01:34:01.723 --> 01:34:04.987
Though those boys
did not manage to kill
that poor woman.

1436
01:34:05.161 --> 01:34:10.079
I reckon some folks think
that rape is worse
than murder.

1437
01:34:10.253 --> 01:34:12.168
They did so much evil.

1438
01:34:12.342 --> 01:34:14.605
Who would vote them
innocent?

1439
01:34:14.779 --> 01:34:17.086
Prosecutor thinks
it might be too devastating
for Tommy and Jolene.

1440
01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.175
especially at their age.

1441
01:34:19.349 --> 01:34:22.482
And says that if he doesn't get
the guilty verdict
like he wants.

1442
01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:26.225
we can always try them again
for the murder
of the Palmer family.

1443
01:34:26.399 --> 01:34:29.228
I'll never understand
the white man's laws.

1444
01:34:30.926 --> 01:34:32.623
Now that saves you

1445
01:34:32.797 --> 01:34:36.018
from trying to figure that
which cannot be figured.

1446
01:34:37.628 --> 01:34:40.196
I also just wanna tell you.

1447
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.372
thank you for always
having my back. partner.

1448
01:34:42.546 --> 01:34:43.939
Same here. partner.

1449
01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:47.507
This is
on the house. fellas.

1450
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.252
Paden Tolbert...
Let's get drunk.

1451
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.387
To Rufus Buck
and his boys hanging.

1452
01:35:05.264 --> 01:35:07.789
<i>You just take
your time. Mrs. Hassan.</i>

1453
01:35:09.442 --> 01:35:11.140
I asked them
if they were hunters.

1454
01:35:13.751 --> 01:35:15.361
He just laughed.

1455
01:35:15.535 --> 01:35:17.973
and asked him
for some water.

1456
01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:22.586
My husband.
being the generous man
that he is.

1457
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.807
sent my brother
down to the stream
to fetch a pail.

1458
01:35:29.636 --> 01:35:32.422
Then the real
nasty-looking one

1459
01:35:32.596 --> 01:35:35.164
pulled his horse
up in front of the others...

1460
01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.645
and doffed his hat at me.

1461
01:35:43.476 --> 01:35:45.827
And I looked at my husband.

1462
01:35:46.001 --> 01:35:47.959
because I knew for certain
we would be lucky

1463
01:35:48.133 --> 01:35:50.483
if we saw another day
on this earth.

1464
01:35:57.664 --> 01:36:02.539
I wanted desperately to save
my husband and my babies.

1465
01:36:02.713 --> 01:36:06.195
I told myself
that my own life
wouldn't matter

1466
01:36:06.369 --> 01:36:09.198
if it would just prevent them
from getting killed.

1467
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.637
But God help me.

1468
01:36:13.811 --> 01:36:18.250
I do think a part of me wished
to save my own life too.

1469
01:36:22.254 --> 01:36:26.563
And now I'm having to live
this wretched existence
because I didn't have

1470
01:36:26.737 --> 01:36:29.914
the courage of the saints
and the martyrs
that I believe in.

1471
01:36:38.618 --> 01:36:41.012
Please.
continue. Mrs. Hassan.

1472
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:53.546
They took me behind the barn.

1473
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.506
made me undress.

1474
01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.726
and held me at gunpoint...

1475
01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:03.600
while all four of 'em
ravaged me.

1476
01:37:05.863 --> 01:37:08.474
I'll have
order in this courtroom!

1477
01:37:08.648 --> 01:37:11.738
Can you point out
the four men in this room

1478
01:37:11.913 --> 01:37:12.914
who did this to you?

1479
01:37:13.088 --> 01:37:14.872
Them.

1480
01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.269
I done wrote me a poem.

1481
01:37:22.619 --> 01:37:25.665
so they ain't just gonna
call me no stupid killer.

1482
01:37:35.632 --> 01:37:37.677
"I dreamt I wasn't here.

1483
01:37:38.983 --> 01:37:41.029
And when the angels fell.

1484
01:37:43.727 --> 01:37:46.643
I never seen
none so handsome.

1485
01:37:46.817 --> 01:37:49.602
a twine and golden hair.

1486
01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:53.215
They looked so neat.

1487
01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:57.349
and they sang so sweet.

1488
01:38:00.613 --> 01:38:02.528
and played the golden harp.

1489
01:38:05.792 --> 01:38:09.013
I was about to go ahead
and pick one out.

1490
01:38:11.059 --> 01:38:14.105
and take her to my heart.

1491
01:38:17.935 --> 01:38:20.590
But the moment that
I began to plead.

1492
01:38:25.073 --> 01:38:26.901
I thought of you. my love.

1493
01:38:28.076 --> 01:38:33.516
And there were none
I'd seen so beautiful

1494
01:38:35.605 --> 01:38:39.870
on earth and your Heaven above."

1495
01:38:53.623 --> 01:38:55.059
"Goodbye. my dear wife.

1496
01:38:57.932 --> 01:39:00.412
Goodbye. my dear mother.

1497
01:39:05.591 --> 01:39:07.376
Also my sisters."

1498
01:39:28.527 --> 01:39:30.486
So. was you there
for the hanging?

1499
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:32.662
I was.

1500
01:39:32.836 --> 01:39:36.492
<i>Saw young Jolene
in the crowd.
with her brother Tommy.</i>

1501
01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:40.061
<i>There was awestruck
by the spectacle.</i>

1502
01:39:42.889 --> 01:39:44.630
<i>And the gang...</i>

1503
01:39:44.804 --> 01:39:47.720
choked back sobs.

1504
01:39:48.765 --> 01:39:50.854
<i>trying to be brave men.</i>

1505
01:39:51.028 --> 01:39:54.989
<i>but they looked
like young boys.</i>

1506
01:39:55.163 --> 01:39:58.514
They weren't the terror
of the Wild West.

1507
01:39:58.731 --> 01:40:01.386
<i>except for Rufus Buck.</i>

1508
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.998
He looked wistful.

1509
01:40:04.172 --> 01:40:06.783
<i>not once taking
his eyes off 'em.</i>

1510
01:40:08.263 --> 01:40:09.655
<i>Young Jolene.</i>

1511
01:40:12.484 --> 01:40:16.923
<i>I swear I saw a tear fall
from her pretty little cheek</i>

1512
01:40:17.141 --> 01:40:19.622
<i>when Maledon pulled that lever.</i>

1513
01:40:23.495 --> 01:40:27.630
<i>And the Rufus Buck Gang
disappeared forever.</i>

1514
01:40:45.691 --> 01:40:47.128
Hey. <i>vato.</i>

1515
01:40:49.173 --> 01:40:52.568
At dawn.
I'll bring the shovels.

1516
01:40:52.742 --> 01:40:54.439
Don't be late.

1517
01:41:07.104 --> 01:41:09.106
Another dead soldier.

1518
01:41:10.368 --> 01:41:14.024
I thank you
for the fond evening.

1519
01:41:14.198 --> 01:41:17.549
and. uh. I bid you <i>adios.</i>

1520
01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:24.382
Well. that was. uh.
quite a journey.

1521
01:41:24.556 --> 01:41:25.688
