3
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.530
Oh. I gotta stop.
I gotta stop this story.

4
00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:32.282
I gotta stop the story.
Stop story.

5
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.577
Oh. come on. Load.
why are you taking so long.

6
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.496
Why are you so slow.

7
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.123
Oh. I need to stop the story.

8
00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.000
No updates now!

9
00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:46.171
Oh. come on. I gotta stop it.

10
00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.382
He's coming.
He's coming up the stairs.

11
00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.385
He's coming up the stairs.
I have to stop it now!

12
00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.972
Come on. stop. stop. stop. stop.

13
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.932
Go away! Call 911.

14
00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:00.686
Somebody call 911. Oh. geez! No!

15
00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.439
No. no. no!

16
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.155
- Jasmin?
- Yes?

17
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:38.283
Alexandria. Do you have
a quick second to talk?

18
00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.219
I don't feel like talking
to the press right now.

19
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.745
I'm not the press.

20
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.389
I actually work with
your father really closely

21
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:44.581
at destiny publishing.

22
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.083
- Okay.
- Did he mention

23
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.685
any short stories
that we was working on?

24
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.461
It could be his best work yet.

25
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.171
I have to go right now. may I?

26
00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.090
This actually might be
worth a lot of money.

27
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.634
seems like you might need it.
It could help you out a lot.

28
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.219
- Excuse me? You got...
- The expenses

29
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.428
on the house. taxes...

30
00:02:58.512 --> 00:02:59.930
You've got some nerve.

31
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.432
- May I?
- It could help you out a lot.

32
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.702
- How long are you in town for?
- A couple of days. a week.

33
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.520
- what does it matter?
- Here's my card.

34
00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.773
If you happen to find anything.
just give me a call.

35
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.191
Whatever.

36
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.214
Jasmin. where did you get this?

37
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.406
In your room. daddy!

38
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.741
Why did you bring it down here?

39
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.493
To play with them.

40
00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.995
But it's not a toy. it's
a very expensive collectible.

41
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.538
It's worth a lot of money.

42
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.624
Do not play
with this again. Ever.

43
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.084
Jasmin. I'm busy right now.
I'm writing.

44
00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.836
I'm writing.
Just put it over there.

45
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.922
I'll look at it later. okay?

46
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.590
Jasmin. what are you doing here?

47
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.467
Papa'. gpor quÃ© no me quiere?

48
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.052
Speak English. Jasmin!

49
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.304
We don't speak Spanish
anymore in this house.

50
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.307
I lost my accent.
you can lose your accent.

51
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.725
Listen. practice this.

52
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.312
"she sells seashells
by the sea shore."

53
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.480
Can you do that?

54
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.398
She sells she...

55
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.900
Ugh. whatever!

56
00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.110
You've been hanging around
that maid too much.

57
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.737
You're speaking
too much Spanish.

58
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.572
You need to go out with
the anglo boys and

59
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.991
- learn better English. now!
- At least she cares!

60
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.003
Pass...

61
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:38.713
Word.

62
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.057
Jasmin.

63
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.866
Frankenstein.

64
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.165
How pathetic.

65
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.632
Oh. my dear Jasmin.

66
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:26.469
As you are watching this.
uh. I'm most likely dead.

67
00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.638
Or maybe you've broken
into my computer.

68
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.933
I'm gonna go with dead for now.

69
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.978
Listen. I know you think
I've always been hard on you.

70
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.523
or ignored you.
but at a certain point.

71
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:40.233
you did the same to me.

72
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.611
Have you ever read
any of my books? Even one?

73
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.696
Did you ever show
any interest in my work?

74
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.532
So. as I see it. we're even.
It's tit for tat.

75
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.285
Jasmin. I know in death.
families always want to have

76
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.163
a moment of resolution where
they get together and say.

77
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.998
"I wish we 'd said this
to one another

78
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.416
while we were still alive."

79
00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.501
and then we'd have closure.

80
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.338
My point of view is.
if we didn't say it back then.

81
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.131
we ain't gonna say it now.

82
00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:06.760
Jasmin. whatever resolutions
you wanted to have.

83
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.720
or hoped to have with me.

84
00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.847
I guess
they're not gonna happen.

85
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.266
Now. Jasmin.
I need to talk about the will.

86
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.978
Um. it's gonna happen someday.
you're gonna get everything.

87
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.772
Everything in
the house is yours.

88
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.982
the books are
the most valuable thing.

89
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.110
and all the movie rights and
the royalties that go with it.

90
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.737
you get all that.

91
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.740
Let me tell you about
my most recent project.

92
00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.201
Aw. it's gonna be great!
It's gonna be big!

93
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.578
80 big. it's gonna be the
biggest thing I've ever done.

94
00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:37.165
I bought a 17th century book
on black magic.

95
00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:41.503
And in that book. they teach
you how to cast magical spells

96
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.171
by writing stories about them.

97
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.507
And when you read
these stories aloud.

98
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.258
they come to life.

99
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.219
So. this could be
much bigger than anything

100
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.972
than you'd see in 3D.
men in tights

101
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.682
hanging from
some walls somewhere.

102
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.475
No. this is gonna be
so much bigger.

103
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.478
Because when you read
these stories out loud.

104
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.230
they come to life.

105
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.816
You can have a real vampire
in your own kitchen.

106
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.568
Now. if you do this.
remember you don't...

107
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.948
Oh my god. he's gone crazy.

108
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.919
Hello. everyone.
Welcome to the audio book of

109
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.422
my famous
short story collection.

110
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.007
monsters in the closet.

111
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.885
Based on a 17th century book
of black magic.

112
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.722
Our first story takes place
on a misty night

113
00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.599
with the smell
of mold everywhere.

114
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.326
Forced it shut!

115
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.085
Shit! Oh fuck! No!

116
00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.797
Ah. no! No!

117
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.507
Oh fuck!

118
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.225
Hello?

119
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.146
Somebody there?

120
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.568
Hey. Hey. man. you need help?

121
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.904
Oh. shit!

122
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.740
It's gotta be somewhere.

123
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.082
Oh. my god. Twinkie.

124
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.923
Oh. these are...

125
00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.345
Not how I remember them tasting.

126
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.359
Apple.

127
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.749
Ugh!

128
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:14.043
Oh. god.

129
00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.260
Oh!

130
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:52.141
Hey. wait for me! I'm coming
with you.

131
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.936
Maybe we can work as a team.

132
00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.247
Is that door locked too?

133
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.332
Get the fuck away from me!

134
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.085
- Fuck!
- Maybe we can...

135
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.336
Oh. shit!

136
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.838
May... urr.

137
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.592
- Fuck.
- You piece of shit!

138
00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:29.011
Hey. what the fuck?
I'm trying to help you!

139
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.431
Ah!

140
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.818
All right!
Bring it on. you fucking scum!

141
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.947
Oh. fuck! Oh god. that hurts!

142
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.574
Oh. fuck!

143
00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.203
Get off!

144
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.990
Dude.

145
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.743
You okay?

146
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.370
What is that wonderful smell?

147
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.331
Is that...

148
00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:39.832
Is that coming from...

149
00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:40.958
Is that coming from you?

150
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:45.296
Please. please be lasagne
in your pockets. Please.

151
00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.930
Mm. mmm. mm.

152
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.932
Why'd I do that?

153
00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.892
I just meant to smell it.

154
00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.978
Hey. stop. No. Don't.

155
00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:04.315
Spit it out. spit it. spit it.

156
00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:05.650
Good girl.

157
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.946
Chris?

158
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.322
Chris?

159
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.452
Oh. Chris. Not you too.

160
00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.705
I'm sorry.

161
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.458
Oh. oh yeah. No. uh...

162
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:26.796
I'm not going to finish it.
You can have the rest.

163
00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.091
So you will not believe
what I just did.

164
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:33.094
Oh wait. no.
Yeah. maybe you would.

165
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.805
Yeah. Right.

166
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.766
Hey. do you mind
if we stick together?

167
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.977
This is kind of...

168
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.062
I mean.
are they going to eat us?

169
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.606
Are we going to eat them?

170
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.526
Is there a cure for this shit
or is it like herpes?

171
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:52.989
You know. I probably should have

172
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.825
told you this before. but...

173
00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.121
I used to have
the hugest crush on you.

174
00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.459
Yeah. not so much right now.

175
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:09.130
So. how long
have you been a zombie?

176
00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.299
Are there rules I should know?

177
00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.658
You know.
you really haven't changed

178
00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.078
all that much.
come to think of it.

179
00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.429
- Ugh!
- What?

180
00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.014
[Gunshofl

181
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.730
Oh. baby.

182
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.648
It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.

183
00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.317
I know. I would be scared too.

184
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.402
but everything is gonna
be all right. I pro...

185
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:36.032
Fuck. oh fuck!

186
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.034
Fuck. did I just do that?

187
00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.911
I didn't mean... Chris.
Shit. I didn't mean to do that.

188
00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:46.042
No. no. no.
I won't let you have her.

189
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.044
Come on. come with me.

190
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.879
Come on. Get away from them.

191
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.547
Leave her alone.
Get out. get away.

192
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.257
I won't let you have her.

193
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.218
We'll hide in here.
I know just the place.

194
00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.554
Shh. be very quiet.

195
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.640
Be very quiet.
they won't find us.

196
00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.395
Stay right there. wait for me.
I'm gonna lock the door.

197
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.860
They won't find us in here.
I promise you. Come on.

198
00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:14.904
Let's get away from the door.
Come with me.

199
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.824
You have to be very still.
be very quiet.

200
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.744
That's a good girl.

201
00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.996
Shh. shh. shh.

202
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.164
Be a good girl.

203
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.874
Be a good girl.

204
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.544
Wait right here with me.

205
00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.546
We will... shit.

206
00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:34.924
It's all right.

207
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.302
We'll wait them out.
They'll go away.

208
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:41.389
They'll go away. They can't
get in. The door is locked.

209
00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.265
I promise you.
they can't get in.

210
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:44.558
It's going to be all right.

211
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.268
Just stay with me.
Stay very still.

212
00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:48.104
Be very quiet. Stay with me.

213
00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.272
I've got you.
I've got you. it's okay.

214
00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.775
No. no!

215
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.944
Please go away. It's okay.

216
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.947
It's going to be okay.
Don't worry. I've got you.

217
00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:00.449
I won't let them hurt you.
I won't let you hurt her.

218
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.244
It's gonna be all right.
Stay right here with me.

219
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.413
No. no. no.

220
00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:07.123
You can't have her. Please!

221
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.542
For god's sake. leave her alone.

222
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.681
Oh. no.

223
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.004
Ugh! Damn it.

224
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:07.933
Damn it.

225
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.269
These hands.

226
00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.564
Oh. here.

227
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.524
Here.

228
00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.860
Take it. take the gun. Take it.

229
00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.404
Take it! Kill me. kill me.

230
00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.698
Kill me. You fucker. kill me!

231
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:26.744
Kill. kill. kill me! Kill me.

232
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.420
I'm so sorry.

233
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.215
Please don't hate me.

234
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.885
No!

235
00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.637
Oh. that's pretty.

236
00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:51.060
See. there's always something
to smile about.

237
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.939
The sun is out. the air is...

238
00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:58.067
Well. it's pretty rank.
actually. But...

239
00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.236
Over there. quick.

240
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.072
Eat led. zombie bitch.

241
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.243
Folks.
wasn't that a great story?

242
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.828
A little bit scary.

243
00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:10.371
Zombies. you gotta
stay away from 'em

244
00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:12.373
because
they're after your brains.

245
00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.124
But let me tell you how to make

246
00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.626
a great egg salad sandwich.

247
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.586
First. you go to
the grocery store

248
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.439
and you go to where
they have all these little

249
00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:20.923
plastic containers
on the shelves

250
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.716
and you find one
that says egg salad.

251
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.260
And then you buy a loaf of bread

252
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.970
and then you buy
a head of lettuce

253
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.596
and you put them all together.

254
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.723
And that's how you make
egg salad sandwich.

255
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:31.559
And don't try
to give one to a zombie.

256
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:33.727
A zombie wants
a brain salad sandwich.

257
00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:48.909
Hello?

258
00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.915
Hello?

259
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.590
Hello. is anyone downstairs?

260
00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:11.724
I said hello.

261
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:25.613
Hello?

262
00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:32.786
Hello.

263
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.253
I gotta stop smoking weed.

264
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.544
For this next story.
we see a young woman

265
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:06.380
looking longingly
at her empty backyard.

266
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:29.528
Honey.
isn't this is so exciting?

267
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.530
Oh. it's beautiful!

268
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:33.407
I can't believe we did it.

269
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.552
I can't believe we actually
finally bought our first house.

270
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:38.037
After all
that freaking paperwork.

271
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.080
It was so ridiculous.

272
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:42.458
Oh my god.
I swear the minute I told them

273
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.626
that I was South African.
that was it.

274
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.712
They were like. "well.
now we need extra deposits

275
00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:50.299
and extra guarantors."
and it was just like...

276
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.301
Little bit of xenophobia.

277
00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.720
Yeah.
like a little bit. honestly.

278
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:56.221
But still. I'm so excited.

279
00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:57.931
This is so amazing.
I love you so much!

280
00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.308
I love you too!

281
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.060
Can you come?
I can't really reach.

282
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:03.103
Yeah!

283
00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:21.830
You just made a massive hole!

284
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:25.000
That's from the door!

285
00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:29.004
I'm gonna need a whole can
of spackle just for that hole!

286
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.255
We can have a little cat!

287
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.584
The water's totally brown!

288
00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:09.169
That is disgusting.

289
00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:12.965
There's probably at least
1.500 parasites in there.

290
00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:15.843
That is so nasty!

291
00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:19.054
We could be puking by morning.

292
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.939
Babe. I really...

293
00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:30.732
Oh. god. Babe... oh. ow!

294
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:36.280
This is great. right?

295
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:38.157
I mean. the appraisal
looks pretty good.

296
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.244
Yeah. uh. it's yeah.
I mean. it's just that

297
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:47.583
I wasn't expecting
so many wires and holes.

298
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.918
A lot of holes.

299
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:53.130
I mean. look. it's...

300
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:55.799
It's gonna be hard work. okay?

301
00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:57.259
I'm not gonna lie to you.

302
00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:59.094
but it's not going
to be a lot of work.

303
00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:03.056
Just some elbow grease.
you know. painting some walls.

304
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.351
spackle some holes.
replace the carpet.

305
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.519
fix the banister.

306
00:28:07.603 --> 00:28:09.605
We should put some tiles in.

307
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:12.316
I think that would be...
Or you know.

308
00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:13.817
Yeah. And you know.

309
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:15.611
we probably just have
to patch the roof.

310
00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:17.463
Not like. replace the whole
thing. It's gonna be fine.

311
00:28:17.487 --> 00:28:19.364
Kinda looks like
it needs to be replaced.

312
00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:20.657
But. um. you know what?

313
00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:22.576
You're... you're right.
Honestly.

314
00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:24.286
you know what?
We... we worked so hard.

315
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.222
We bought this house.
and that's all that matters.

316
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:27.956
And as long as we have a shower

317
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.459
and... and
some running water. that's.

318
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.003
you know...
You checked the plumbing.

319
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:35.756
I am going to check
the plumbing too.

320
00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.424
That's... that's on the list.

321
00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:42.804
So we don't know
if we have a shower right now.

322
00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:44.640
- We will.
- We will?

323
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.308
- We will!
- We will know.

324
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:50.646
You know how we'll know.
because we hired a contractor.

325
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.606
We did. We did that.
And that's so great

326
00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:53.875
'cause you emailed
the contractor

327
00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:55.609
like I asked you to. right?

328
00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:57.819
He's gonna fix all of this.

329
00:28:57.903 --> 00:28:59.821
This is... this is fine.

330
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.156
What am I stressing about.

331
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.367
We hired the contractor. right?

332
00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:08.580
The contractor?

333
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:09.998
I sent you his email address

334
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.668
and you said that
you contacted him.

335
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.213
And that he was gonna
fix everything.

336
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:22.010
Babe. I spent all of
our money on buying the house.

337
00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:25.764
so there's no money left
for a contractor.

338
00:29:25.847 --> 00:29:27.599
We don't have a contractor?

339
00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:31.478
Babe. it's fine.
I took shop in high school.

340
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.730
You did honey.
and you got an a-plus.

341
00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:40.862
I got a letter with a plus sign
after it every semester.

342
00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.573
So that's a good sign.

343
00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:47.035
Great.
Yeah. that's... that's fine.

344
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.912
You are right. You know what?

345
00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:50.664
Are you sure?

346
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:53.333
Look. anything
that we need to find out.

347
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:55.294
we look up on the YouTube.

348
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:59.047
And that way we don't
have to pay some dumb plumber

349
00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:01.717
to come down and have us
stare at his ass crack

350
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.928
while he. like. hits on you
and does shoddy plumbing.

351
00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:06.638
- Right.
- We just do it ourselves and we

352
00:30:06.722 --> 00:30:09.224
don't have to pay anybody
'cause the Internet is free.

353
00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:12.769
- The Internet is free. Right.
- You're so cute

354
00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:14.104
when you realize things.

355
00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:16.523
We're gonna make
this house so cute.

356
00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:18.275
I love you. shmoopy.

357
00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:21.361
I love you more! No. that nose!

358
00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:23.488
- No. that nose.
- You're gonna make it greasy.

359
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.742
- Don't touch it.
- Okay. time to work.

360
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.243
Okay.

361
00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:30.746
You do that.

362
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.506
Okay. so you're saying that...

363
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.091
Right.
that after I nail that one.

364
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.218
after I've sanded and then...

365
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.845
Yeah. I know. Okay.

366
00:30:46.928 --> 00:30:48.555
But what happens to the spackle?

367
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.016
I gotta let you go.

368
00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:52.684
Shmoopy. what happened.

369
00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:54.895
You dropped it because
you were too busy on the phone

370
00:30:54.978 --> 00:30:56.271
because you're
not concentrating.

371
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.065
You're right.

372
00:30:58.148 --> 00:30:59.524
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:03.111
Let's just... keep going. Okay?

374
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:05.572
- Come on. shmoopy.
- All right. shmoopy.

375
00:31:05.655 --> 00:31:07.199
I love you. shmoopy.

376
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:08.950
- I love you.
- I love you more.

377
00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:10.535
No. really. I love you more.

378
00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:13.163
- No. I love you more.
- No. really.

379
00:31:13.246 --> 00:31:14.414
It's... I love you.

380
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:27.344
Okay. honey. do you have
all the slats in place?

381
00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:29.388
- Yeah. the slats are in.
- Perfect.

382
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:31.973
- Nails are through the hinges.
- Awesome.

383
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:35.685
Yeah. I mean. I think
this is pretty well hung.

384
00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:38.063
I just have a question.

385
00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:39.773
- Yeah?
- Why is there so much space

386
00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:41.525
between the top and the sides

387
00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:44.736
that kind of defeats the entire
purpose of having a door.

388
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.447
Baby. trust me.
I looked at the diagnostic

389
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:49.408
blueprints for
the door frame. Okay?

390
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:51.034
- You did?
- Yeah.

391
00:31:51.118 --> 00:31:53.662
there's supposed to be
at least one inch of space.

392
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.997
The diagnostic blueprints
of the door

393
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.666
told you to have space.

394
00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:03.422
Minimum one inch
between door frame and door

395
00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:06.591
for ventilation
in case of a fire.

396
00:32:06.675 --> 00:32:08.969
- That's what it said.
- I'm going to... all right.

397
00:32:09.052 --> 00:32:10.595
I'm gonna trust you.

398
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.848
This is definitely
at least one inch.

399
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.182
You're really smart.

400
00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:15.642
You are. You're... no!

401
00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:18.520
You're... you're a-door-able!

402
00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:21.857
That's too good.
I can't top that. That's a...

403
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.944
God. what the hell?

404
00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.571
Yeah. I told you that was wrong.

405
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.573
but you just don't want
to listen to me. so...

406
00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:31.450
Maybe if you just listened
to me sometimes.

407
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:32.951
you would
get things right. but...

408
00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:34.870
When did you tell me
that it was wrong?

409
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.848
Yeah. I said. like. "you're
doing the whole thing wrong."

410
00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:39.875
Like. three times.
but you just ignored me.

411
00:32:40.417 --> 00:32:42.794
Do you have the blueprint there?

412
00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:45.338
You know. I guess I'll find it.

413
00:32:45.422 --> 00:32:46.882
Shmoop!

414
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:50.385
What happened? I thought
you were looking at the...

415
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:53.096
- Shmoopy...
- Okay. I was making it up.

416
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.015
I'm sorry. I was confused.

417
00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:58.059
- You... no!
- I was just playing.

418
00:32:58.143 --> 00:33:00.270
You're such a playful one.

419
00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:01.855
Stop it.

420
00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:03.190
No. you stop!

421
00:33:03.273 --> 00:33:04.900
No. Stop.

422
00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.818
-Seriously
-no. stop. Stop hitting me.

423
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:09.005
No. can you... I'm trying to...
Can you stop? Stop hitting me.

424
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:10.572
If you hit me.
I'm gonna hit you back.

425
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.325
- Stop hitting me.
- As long as I get the last hit.

426
00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:14.635
You're being difficult. shmoop.

427
00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:15.899
Did you just call me difficult?

428
00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:19.056
If you call me difficult.
I'll gorge your eyes out.

429
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.292
I said.
you're being divine. shmoopy.

430
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:24.586
Stop being so silly.

431
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:33.929
- Honey?
- Yes?

432
00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:38.016
Why are you painting a 2
across our brand new wall?

433
00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:40.393
Well. because darling. that is

434
00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:42.604
the most efficient way
to paint a wall.

435
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:46.233
No. actually. according
to howtopaintyourhouse. Com.

436
00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:50.529
it most certainly says
that you start with a w.

437
00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:52.614
Well. shmoopy.
when I was in shop

438
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:55.784
in high school getting
pluses on all my grades

439
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:59.621
all six years.
it was always with a z shape.

440
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:03.875
Okay. Well. I really do think

441
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:14.010
I think the 2 looks way better.

442
00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:16.930
Really?

443
00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:18.682
I think the w looks better.

444
00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:20.925
What are you gonna do...
What do you gonna do about it?

445
00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:22.435
The man says 2!

446
00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:27.107
You don't even have
as much paint on me

447
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.317
as I have on you
and you've done three passes.

448
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:30.986
Yeah. well. I'm just being nice.

449
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:32.779
I'm trying not to
stuff up your...

450
00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:35.824
- Z shape!
- I'm just a nice person.

451
00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.493
- And you...
- You can't even get a w

452
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:39.911
on your husband's chest.

453
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.250
You're almost whiter
than this wall!

454
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.419
Your hair glove is falling off!

455
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:52.716
Look. 2 shapes all day.

456
00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:56.011
z shapes all day.
2 shapes all day.

457
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.596
the man says 2.

458
00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:01.141
And calls crocodile tears.

459
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:06.229
Crocodile tears. shmoops.

460
00:35:57.697 --> 00:36:00.784
I am so sorry.

461
00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:04.204
That was totally a mistake.

462
00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:07.415
I don't even know if
I believe that.

463
00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:09.376
- to be honest with you.
- Shmoopy!

464
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.628
You know
I would never try to hurt you.

465
00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:15.340
Who's my favorite shmoopy!

466
00:36:15.423 --> 00:36:17.384
I love you. shmoopy.

467
00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:18.843
Yeah. yeah. whatever.

468
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.613
I love you too. shmoopy.

469
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:22.597
No. I love you more. shmoopy.

470
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:24.367
No. I love you more. shmoopy.

471
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:25.993
No. it's me. I love you more.

472
00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:27.370
- Does this face look amused?
- What?

473
00:36:27.394 --> 00:36:29.020
Do I look amused?

474
00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:32.107
You look like you're just
having so much fun like me.

475
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.192
So. shmoopy.
would you mind handing me

476
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:38.446
that bucket. please.
so I can keep working up here?

477
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.740
- You want the bucket?
- Who's my favorite shmoop?

478
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:42.575
- You want the bucket?
- Yeah.

479
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:44.637
Could you hand me the bucket?
Yeah. that'd be really nice.

480
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:46.371
Shmoopy. I love you.

481
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:47.956
- Love you!
- You're my favorite.

482
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.499
- You're my favorite!
- Who's got the

483
00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:51.251
best nose in all the land?

484
00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:53.628
- Thank you. shmoopy.
- Oh.

485
00:36:53.712 --> 00:36:55.004
Oops.

486
00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:57.465
That's okay.

487
00:36:57.549 --> 00:37:00.051
I love you. still. shmoopy.

488
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:02.762
But. if next time you could
just hand me the bucket

489
00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:05.056
when I ask you to actually
hand me the bucket.

490
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.475
I'd really appreciate it.
then maybe it wouldn't

491
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:11.062
come crashing down on your head
while I'm working.

492
00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:13.356
I love you.
Please keep up your good work.

493
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.108
Thank you. shmoop.

494
00:38:09.788 --> 00:38:12.248
I love you. shmoopy.

495
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.793
Fuck you.

496
00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:19.005
Love you.

497
00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:20.298
Ah!

498
00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.260
Time to nail.

499
00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:32.560
What?

500
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:37.899
Oh!

501
00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:43.863
Does it hurt?

502
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:52.413
It's okay. it's okay.
it's okay. shmoopy.

503
00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:53.873
We're almost done.

504
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:57.085
Just a little bit
more paint and spackle.

505
00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.795
We're almost there.

506
00:39:00.547 --> 00:39:02.006
Okay.

507
00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:06.696
What are you...
What are you doing?

508
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:10.116
Cutting ceramic tile.

509
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.584
You got... you gotta to stop.

510
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.377
You gotta stop!

511
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:22.837
Stop!

512
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:25.840
Stop!

513
00:40:28.593 --> 00:40:29.719
Stop!

514
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.348
That's really dangerous.

515
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.016
Okay? The...

516
00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:39.187
The dust from the tile
could go into your lungs and...

517
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.274
And it's... it can kill you
and there's no cure.

518
00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.861
there is no cure.

519
00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:12.178
I want a divorce.

520
00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:25.733
Oh. honey. I'm sorry.

521
00:41:30.989 --> 00:41:32.115
Sweetie.

522
00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:35.076
Shmoop.

523
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:37.578
Oh!

524
00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:38.913
Oh!

525
00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:40.456
Oh. god.

526
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.291
Oh you. bitch.

527
00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:45.962
Oh. you bitch!

528
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:48.756
You know when I told you
I loved your old sugar cookies?

529
00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:52.510
I lied. That shit tastes
like camel spit.

530
00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:58.850
Oh. god!

531
00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:17.035
Oh fuck you. shmoopy.

532
00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:19.162
Fuck you too. shmoopy.

533
00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:22.749
Till death do us
fucking part. bitch.

534
00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:34.719
_

535
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.971
Fuck you. shmoopy.

536
00:42:48.149 --> 00:42:50.068
Ugh!

537
00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:11.214
Oh god. why?

538
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:23.810
I love you. shmoop.

539
00:43:23.893 --> 00:43:26.479
I love you.

540
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:06.787
Wow. Wasn't that something

541
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.581
with all that blood
flying around?

542
00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:10.958
I'm not sure I'm gonna
eat my cereal now.

543
00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:13.127
but that raises the question.

544
00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:14.378
is cereal soup?

545
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:15.662
You know. when you were a kid.

546
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:17.215
you made soup out of stones.

547
00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:19.467
Why can't you make
soup out of cereal

548
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.344
if you really want to? You know.

549
00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:22.887
there '3 a cereal
that kind of has

550
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.639
a rabbit
whenever you see it on TV.

551
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:26.807
You can make soup out of rabbit.

552
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.809
So why can't you make soup
out of cereal?

553
00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:32.271
You know. why don't we put
some carrots and celery in it

554
00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:34.075
and have the cereal
with carrots and celery?

555
00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:35.788
Then it really would be soup.
wouldn't it?

556
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.238
You know. chop in some celery.
and some onions.

557
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:43.282
and some carrots. and now
you've got cereal soup.

558
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:45.910
Stop. Get away from me.

559
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.127
Well. I don't think
you'd like the cereal

560
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:57.171
with carrots and celery
in it now.

561
00:45:57.255 --> 00:45:58.714
I don't think so.

562
00:45:58.798 --> 00:46:00.424
So. let's just
come to a conclusion.

563
00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.510
- Cereal is not soup.
- Get away from me.

564
00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.512
Get away from me!

565
00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.459
For our next story. we join

566
00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:38.045
a very rich businessman
and his daughter

567
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:41.382
as they share coffee
in downtown Manhattan.

568
00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:57.064
This is so unfair.

569
00:46:58.065 --> 00:46:59.400
Tiffany. life is unfair.

570
00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.986
But you are being
more than unfair.

571
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:04.155
Look. fair is my middle name.

572
00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:05.906
Just ask my bridge partners

573
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.075
or even the guys on
the trading floor.

574
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:11.412
You saw me talk to
the chauffeur the other day.

575
00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:14.999
I told him he has every right
to be as rich as I am.

576
00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:16.834
All he has to do is work for it.

577
00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:22.131
I started my business with
a couple of million dollars.

578
00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:24.008
He could do the same.

579
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.760
But obviously he's lazy.

580
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.846
Otherwise. he wouldn't
still be driving cars.

581
00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:33.642
He's not Mexican lazy.
but... still.

582
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:36.937
He gets what he deserves.

583
00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:39.106
I get what I deserve.

584
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.608
And you get what you deserve.

585
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.109
And I deserve this.

586
00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:46.489
It's just a camping trip
with my friends.

587
00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.701
And why haven't
I ever met these friends?

588
00:47:50.785 --> 00:47:52.370
I mean. what are they like?

589
00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:54.455
They're nice people. daddy.

590
00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:55.831
Nice.

591
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:59.210
So you like one of them.

592
00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:01.003
some cute boy. perhaps?

593
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:02.755
Maybe.

594
00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:05.758
What's his name?

595
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:07.635
- Is it the wellingworth boy...
- No. daddy.

596
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:08.969
you don't know him.

597
00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:12.306
His name is... Vinnie.

598
00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:17.561
Vinnie. Oh. Jesus.

599
00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:19.397
Are you telling me he's Italian?

600
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.941
He's really sweet.

601
00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:24.485
Sweet. What does his father do?

602
00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:27.279
Okay. I don't know.
I think he's a plumber.

603
00:48:27.363 --> 00:48:29.365
Oh. my god. Oh...

604
00:48:29.448 --> 00:48:31.659
Are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

605
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:34.328
All right. You know what?
This is just...

606
00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:37.998
It's just...
All right. Yeah. Hang on.

607
00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:40.126
Here. wait a minute.

608
00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:41.669
I'll tell you what.

609
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.592
why don't you go shopping
this weekend instead?

610
00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:48.217
Wouldn't you prefer a nice
bracelet or a pretty dress?

611
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.637
No. I want to go camping.

612
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.431
I worked hard
to get into the school

613
00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:54.932
that you wanted me to go to.

614
00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:58.185
You chose Princeton. not me.

615
00:48:58.269 --> 00:49:00.688
Don't I deserve
a little bit of a reward?

616
00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:04.692
It's just a trip
with my friends.

617
00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:09.738
You don't get it. sweetie.

618
00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:11.031
They're not your friends.

619
00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:13.451
They hate you. They hate me.

620
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:18.831
We are what they would call
one percenters.

621
00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:23.335
Your friends are... not.

622
00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:25.254
They're the 99 belower.

623
00:49:25.337 --> 00:49:28.507
And Vinnie.
he may even be a negative five.

624
00:49:29.717 --> 00:49:31.927
Look. your friends
have been brainwashed

625
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:34.430
into believing
that you and I hate america.

626
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:37.391
but in fact.
it's them who hate america.

627
00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:39.602
And everything it stands for.

628
00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:44.064
Now. really. if you want
to go ahead and feel common.

629
00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:46.400
why don't you buy yourself
a little hermes bracelet

630
00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:48.402
or some little thing like that

631
00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:50.321
and forget about
the camping nonsense?

632
00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:53.073
Okay. first of all.
daddy. it's "air-mes."

633
00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:57.912
Second of all. in three months.
I'm going to be in Princeton.

634
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:00.122
making my own mistakes.
getting drunk.

635
00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:04.251
failing midterms. eating pizza
with the wrong fork.

636
00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:06.670
You're not going to be there
to save me.

637
00:50:06.754 --> 00:50:09.632
I need to start learning
from my own mistakes.

638
00:50:12.134 --> 00:50:14.094
It's just a weekend.

639
00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:16.555
Think of it as training wheels.

640
00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:20.351
Come... come on. daddy.
I've earned this.

641
00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:22.686
Fine. fine.

642
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.189
But you're taking
your cell phone.

643
00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:26.899
you're turning it on.

644
00:50:26.982 --> 00:50:29.527
and most importantly...

645
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.111
Call us if you need it.

646
00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:32.756
Thank you. thank you.
thank you. thank you.

647
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.241
You are the best daddy ever.

648
00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:39.245
Vinnie.

649
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:42.331
This is not going to end well.

650
00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:14.196
Hey. Tiffany.
look. I pissed on myself.

651
00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:17.324
You must be
very proud of yourself.

652
00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:19.302
No. no. actually. I just...
I didn't pee on myself.

653
00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:21.203
I just sprayed beer all over.

654
00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:25.332
Wait! Do you want
to take a closer look?

655
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:30.921
So what's up.
what did you want to show me?

656
00:51:31.005 --> 00:51:33.716
I got this...
This thing for Tiffany.

657
00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:35.509
Oh yeah. I saw you
put it in your pocket.

658
00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:37.052
Yeah. I'm kind of nervous.

659
00:51:37.136 --> 00:51:38.738
- It's a big weekend for me.
- Don't be nervous.

660
00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.389
- Let me see it.
- All right.

661
00:51:40.472 --> 00:51:42.558
- Yeah. definitely.
- How big is it?

662
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:43.934
It's not that big.

663
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:45.686
Oh. you're probably
being modest.

664
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:48.022
Come on. Just show me. Hold on.
Oh. wait. here she comes.

665
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.898
Can we go somewhere else?

666
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:52.359
Listen. you having a good time?

667
00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:56.697
Can you just give me a moment?

668
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.490
We can go somewhere
and have a talk.

669
00:51:58.574 --> 00:52:00.614
I just want to finish
the conversation with Maureen.

670
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.663
Listen. just try to have fun.

671
00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:07.374
You're much prettier
when you smile.

672
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:10.502
We'll be right back.

673
00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:53.462
Yeah. So. I mean. I know
this is crazy. but. um...

674
00:52:54.213 --> 00:52:55.297
I'm crazy about her.

675
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:57.216
- Aw!
- And I know that

676
00:52:57.299 --> 00:53:00.094
we've only been dating for.
like. three months. but...

677
00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:02.930
Think I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

678
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.348
What? That's amazing!

679
00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:06.058
Yeah. I'm going to do it
this weekend.

680
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:17.945
- Well. do you have it with you?
- Yeah. I do.

681
00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.256
I mean. I've only been carrying
it around with me all day.

682
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.741
Let me see it. let me see it.
How are you gonna do it?

683
00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:24.368
Are you gonna
get down on one knee?

684
00:53:24.451 --> 00:53:26.179
Are you gonna just. like.
spring it on her? Like...

685
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.746
- I... I don't know.
- That's...

686
00:53:34.086 --> 00:53:36.839
- That is so amazing.
- Thanks.

687
00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:44.179
- Oh. she's gonna love that.
- You think so?

688
00:53:44.263 --> 00:53:45.848
Is there something on it?

689
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:48.267
Yeah. there's an inscription
I had them put on it.

690
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:58.152
That is so sweet.

691
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.654
Oh. yes.
she is going to love that.

692
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:02.573
Perfect find. Absolutely.

693
00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:04.408
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate that.

694
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:05.784
I just had to tell somebody.

695
00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:07.619
My god. I'm so excited for you.

696
00:54:07.703 --> 00:54:09.580
Thank you.

697
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:15.043
[Gunshofl

698
00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:23.260
Vinnie. Vinnie?
Vinnie. are you okay?

699
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:26.096
- Oh. my god. what happened?
- It was an accident.

700
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.683
Oh. Vinnie. Oh. my god.

Oh. my god! Vinnie. Vinnie?

He has a big time attorney.

708
00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:41.945

You know. rich people
like to go hunting.

They like to go after animals
like elephants

784
01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.526
and bison and stuff like that.

785
01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.212

what would they say

786
01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.570
about being shot at?

787
01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.155

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.366

not take so well

789
01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:09.160
to being shot at
by voicing their opinion?

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.870

I think the rudest animal
would be a sloth.

794
01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.081
All they want to do
is hang around

795
01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.365
and if you try to get them
to do something. they'll say.

796

"yeah. get the fuck
away from me. pal."

a turtle. the same way.

he can beat the rabbit.

Yes. Well. sir. we actually
had a really good meeting.

didn't get her number.

Jasmin Grant today.

811
01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.270

Why?

812
01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.021
I didn't want to push it.

813
01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.333

Push it.
We're all going through a lot.

816
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.071
Do you have any idea
how many publishers

817
01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:52.532
are knocking on that decrepit
door to get to that book?

818
01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.201
This is a big deal.
This book is gonna be huge.

819

820
01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.205
She doesn't even know.

821
01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.666
Raymond had deadlines.

822
01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:03.877
and he was constantly
missing all the deadlines.

823
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.963
For all we know. it could be
a collection of just post-its.

824
01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.424
Right. Post-its.

825
01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:14.053
Yeah. right. We were probably
gonna drop him anyway.

826
01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.848
Last couple of films
flopped at the box office.

827
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:18.558
Book sales tanked.

828
01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.810
He kept saying. "I just
need one. one more hit and...

829
01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.145
I'm back on top."

830
01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.399
Exactly. we all thought
he just had a writer's block.

831
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.943
You know. his best stuff
was his early work.

832
01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.987
Towards the end...

833
01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.281
Just like bands.
win three albums.

834
01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:35.158
after that they all suck.

835
01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:36.910
Same thing.

836
01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.304
You know what happens
to those bands

837
01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.412
when their front man dies?

838
01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.457
Everybody and their mother
is clawing to get

839
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.351
the last album because
it might be worth something.

840
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.335
even though they haven't
had a hit in two decades.

841
01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:50.256
No. yeah. you're right.

842
01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.081

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.225
And if I didn't tell you that
your job depended on this one.

845
01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:01.976
well. I'd be lying.

846

- So let me know.
- Okay.

847
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.121
Well. those are the perils
of being invisible.

848
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.207
That's why
they wear those yellow vests

849
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.084
out on the highway. right?

850
01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.187
Invisible man would never
work on the highway. Oh my.

851
01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.923
Anyway. the question we need
to address right now is

852
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:33.967
how many chickens would it take

853
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.343
to kill an elephant?

854
01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:44.561
Hello?

855
01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.440
Hello?

856
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.285
Hello?

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.040

858
01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:12.964
Hello?

859
01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.217
Hello?

860
01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.554
Anyone home?

861
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:27.437
! Oye! GquÃ© te pasa?
GquÃ© tu haces en mi casa?

862
01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.691
Lesperate! No soy.

863
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:51.169
Um. would it take 500
elephant-sized chickens

864
01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.630
to kill
an elephant-sized chicken?

865
01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:05.767
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go with.

866
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.519
it's gonna take
one elephant-sized chicken

867
01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:09.937
to kill an elephant.

868
01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:11.564
And that would be
one big chicken.

869
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.401
When he pecks. earthquake time.

870
01:09:15.485 --> 01:09:18.571
Our next story is about
a conference of scientists.

871
01:09:18.655 --> 01:09:20.865
It's a typical
scientific meeting

872
01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:24.619
where some scientists are
more welcome than others.

873
01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:03.116
Why the hell do we have
to live in a castle?

874
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.492
It's just one of the many perks

875
01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:06.327
of being a mad scientist.
my darling.

876
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:07.912
But you're not mad.

877
01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:10.248
- No.
- You're not even annoyed.

878
01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.250
You're...

879
01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.376
Perky.

880
01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.753
Why the hell are you so perky?

881
01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:19.257
It's your birthday.

882
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.009
That's says 50. Do I look 50?

883
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:23.469
Uh. no. no. no.

884
01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.430
And you do not look 50
the other eight times

885
01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.306
we celebrated
your 50th birthday either.

886
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:30.351
Seven. I am 57.

887
01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.979
Do I look 58?

888
01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.982
Why can't you invent
something useful.

889
01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.442
like an anti-aging formula

890
01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.610
and not roller skates
for squirrels?

891
01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:43.322
Well. I will admit to a bit
of a dry period lately.

892
01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:46.117
but honestly.
this cake is del... oh!

893
01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.340
Don't worry. baby.

894
01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.509
It's just a little bit stuck.

895
01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.678
You'll be fine.

896
01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.263
Just stay still. Don't move.

897
01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.974
You're not moving.
You're good at not moving.

898
01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.225
Oh!

899
01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:15.646
Honey. honey. honey!
Honey. you okay?

900
01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.684
She's alive!

901
01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:55.019
She's alive!

902
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.648
Crapola!

903
01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.587
She's alive!

904
01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.214
She's alive!

905
01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:24.757
Motherfucker!

906
01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.440
Mr. Frankenstein.

907
01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.651
Dr. Frankenstein. actually.

908
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.486
Whatever. What is it this time?

909
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.406
I was wondering if
I could borrow a little power.

910
01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.782
just as scooch.

911
01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.284
Power.

912
01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.803
That's all you mad
scientists think about.

913
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:55.454
power to rule the world.

914
01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.224
Well. I don't think
you even have enough power

915
01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.666
to mow your lawn.

916
01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.585
Ah. yes. the death weeds.

917
01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.712
Well. I promise to get
to them next Tuesday.

918
01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.132
There was an experiment
that went wrong.

919
01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.718
- Sorry about the dog.
- What?

920
01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.636
Huh? What?

921
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.764
Look. last week
it was a cup of sugar.

922
01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:16.183
the week before that
it was tea bags.

923
01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.185
Now this.

924
01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.605
What do you need
my electricity for?

925
01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.317
Just to reanimate the dead.

926
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.443
It's no biggie.

927
01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:26.903
Very low power consumption.

928
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.364
- Huh.
- Yeah. it's...

929
01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.283
Funny. actually. Funny story.

930
01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.493
I accidentally killed my wife.
and you know.

931
01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.496
I would like to see her back
so. if I could just...

932
01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.749
Yeah. whatever.

933
01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.167
Thank you.

934
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.044
What a bitch.

935
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.776
She's alive.

936
01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.361
She's alive!

937
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.697
What the fuck are you doing?

938
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.741
Just checking to see
if you're alive again.

939
01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.535
Again?

940
01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:00.246
Did you fucking kill me?

941
01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.415
Just temporarily.
You're a lot better now.

942
01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.125
Look. you're siting up
and everything.

943
01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.669
You stabbed me?

944
01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:10.214
Oh. my god. you better not
have left a scar.

945
01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:14.010
No. you look as lovely as ever.

946
01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:15.553
Where's the mirror?

947
01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:19.265
Where's that damn mirror?

948
01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.951
Well. there's one by the
kitchen. there's another one

949
01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.518
in the bathroom...
Let's go this way.

950
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.020
This is a nice big one.

951
01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.648
Victor. you motherfucker.
I'm hideous!

952
01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.067
Only on the outside.

953
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.319
I mean. beauty's only skin deep.

954
01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:33.988
Oh. god.

955
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.865
Oh. god. What has he done?

956
01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.746
Honey. what are you doing?

957
01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.168
You know. it's not so bad...

958
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:49.045
With a little make up on

959
01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.589
you'll be as beautiful
as the day I met you.

960
01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.552
Honey?

961
01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.471
Honey boo-boo?

962
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.152
I don't know what happened.

963
01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.738
You must have tripped
and accidentally swallowed

964
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.865
all those pills.
but do not worry.

965
01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:19.825
Threw them all out.
We'll be just fine.

966
01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.203
Right. An accident.

967
01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:25.164
I got a little surprise for you.

968
01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.124
- What?
- Upstairs.

969
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.834
I set up the VCR
with all those tapes

970
01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.419
of you winning
the beauty contest.

971
01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:32.671
I know how that cheers you up.

972
01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.007
We'll go upstairs
and watch them. yeah? Come on.

973
01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.258
Come on.

974
01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.317
There she is!

975
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.444
Oh. my god. Honey. you are so...

976
01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.863
Oh. by the way.

977
01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:00.491
I was thinking
about how to deal with.

978
01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:02.701
let's call them
blemishes on your face.

979
01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.955
and while you were away.

980
01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.665
I took an art class.

981
01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.542
I think I was able
to reconstruct

982
01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.085
your face really well.

983
01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:13.546
Oh. yeah? You fixed me.

984
01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.591
So you're telling me I'm
as beautiful as I was before?

985
01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:20.302
Even better.
and I got a perfect score

986
01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:22.012
from my art teacher.

987
01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.722
I don't know.

988
01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.600
It doesn't feel right.

989
01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.853
What artist did you study?

990
01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:30.229
Picasso!

991
01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:41.574
What the hell is this?

992
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:45.244
I knew your affections for
the cat were very strong. so.

993
01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:50.166
You attached Fifi to me?

994
01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.418
Yes! Don't you love it?

995
01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.503
Now. you guys
will never be separated.

996
01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:58.090
What the fuck is wrong with you?

997
01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.758
Wait. you don't like this?

998
01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.472
If that's Fifi.

999
01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:08.267
who the hell is this
you've attached to me?

1000
01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:12.605
I don't know.
he was back by the dumpsters.

1001
01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.566
So cute. looks just
like Fifi. doesn't it?

1002
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.822
Think of it as like
a windshield wiper.

1003
01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:25.618
you grow used to it.
your friends will be jealous.

1004
01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:43.052
Victor. stop bringing me back.

1005
01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:44.637
But I love you!

1006
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.848
But I don't love
living this way.

1007
01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:50.476
What can I do to make you happy?

1008
01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.811
You can make me beautiful again.

1009
01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.522
But you already are beautiful.

1010
01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:57.149
No. I'm not.

1011
01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.652
You're the most beautiful
women that I know.

1012
01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.654
I'm ugly.

1013
01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.322
You're a masterpiece.

1014
01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:04.907
Your delicate hands...

1015
01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.161
Your wonderful eyes.
Your beautiful smile.

1016
01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.373
Your radiance knows no bounds.

1017
01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:14.333
You really think so?

1018
01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.460
I most certainly do. my darling.

1019
01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.087
Then kiss me.

1020
01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.548
- What?
- Kiss me.

1021
01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:25.010
If I'm not vile to look at
then make love to me.

1022
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.848
If I'm as beautiful as ever.

1023
01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:34.603
then you should want
to pounce on me right now.

1024
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.985
Crapola.

1025
01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.572
Are you sure
you're in the mood. honey?

1026
01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:47.491
- Yes.
- Because. you know.

1027
01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:49.052
we could watch television
or something.

1028
01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:52.121
Make me feel beautiful.

1029
01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:53.914
Yeah. Cool. Cool. cool. Sure.

1030
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.553
Okay. okay. Let's do this.

1031
01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.904
Is it good for you. baby?

1032
01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:29.491
I should have made the daddy
hole a little bit bigger.

1033
01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:34.830
Oh. it's the balloon.

1034
01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.498
Just the balloon.

1035
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.716
Are you okay. Victor?

1036
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.845
Yeah. that was amazing. baby.

1037
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.891
Just like our wedding night.

1038
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:41.271
You have definitely
not aged one bit.

1039
01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:43.982
Oh. my god.

1040
01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.693
Oh. I'll get it. baby.

1041
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.823
I ordered dinner.

1042
01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:55.035
So you just stay there and bask
in the glory of... my love.

1043
01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:56.829
I'll get the dinner.

1044
01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.124
Magic pizza!

1045
01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:05.087
We deliver in less than five
hours or your soda is half off.

1046
01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.798
Yes.
Wonderful. wonderful. Honey!

1047
01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.383
I'm just going
to get some pizza.

1048
01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:11.468
put in the blender
for your food hole.

1049
01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.262
Let's see what I got there.

1050
01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:15.347
How are you doing. buddy?
What's your name?

1051
01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:16.598
Fuck off.

1052
01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.184
Fuckov? Is that Russian? Fuckov?

1053
01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:21.854
Say.
there's something on your roof.

1054
01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.856
Huh? What?

1055
01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.616
Oh. shit.

1056
01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.879
What are you complaining about?

1057
01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:51.467
It's only been a couple of
weeks. you'll get used to it.

1058
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:55.262
Besides. not only did
you get your second hand back.

1059
01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:58.140
but you have
a third one as a spare.

1060
01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:03.479
Hey! Those are my lips.

1061
01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.647
Ah. fuckov.
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.

1062
01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:08.400
You're a very good kisser.
though.

1063
01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:17.784
Nibbling on your ears
is positively delicious.

1064
01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:20.913
Victor. this has to stop.

1065
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.123
What? I can always get
more pizza. What you think?

1066
01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:24.887
He's the only pizza guy
in the world. baby?

1067
01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:27.628
I'm done. I want out.

1068
01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.505
Okay. you want to go out?

1069
01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:30.923
Let's see.
we could go to the park

1070
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.883
if we go out the backdoor...

1071
01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:35.719
I want a divorce.

1072
01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:40.599
Look at me. Just look at me.

1073
01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:44.937
Can you honestly tell me
I'm beautiful?

1074
01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:47.147
Honestly.

1075
01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.983
I'm not gonna lie.
it's taking a little bit

1076
01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:51.711
to get used to you new features
but you know.

1077
01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:53.445
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1078
01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.572
We all change physically.

1079
01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.660
It's not the physical things
that are important. though.

1080
01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:02.287
I did not fall in love
with you for your beauty alone.

1081
01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.498
I fell in love with you for
your kindness and

1082
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:06.792
your sense of humor
and the way you cheered me up

1083
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.126
when my experiments went wrong.

1084
01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:09.711
and you had to do
that quite a bit.

1085
01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:11.713
Am I kidding? No.

1086
01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:16.301
The heart does not use
the eyes to see.

1087
01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:20.681
True beauty can not
be reflected in the mirror.

1088
01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:25.060
I love you. The real you.
the deep down inside you.

1089
01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:28.522
Nothing could change that. ever.

1090
01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:30.190
You know.
they call me a mad scientist.

1091
01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:31.984
Well. yes. I am mad.

1092
01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.736
I'm mad about you.

1093
01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.072
You know what?

1094
01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.491
I have a cousin
who's a plastic surgeon.

1095
01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.827
I'm sold. Goodbye. Victor.

1096
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.287
Have a nice life.

1097
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.247
Wait...

1098
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.833
Wait. what? What?

1099
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:55.507
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1100
01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.635
Wait. wait.

1101
01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.022
A monster. kill it!

1102
01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.399
Oh. hey.

1103
01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.068
Oh. great. great read.

1104
01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:59.321
You must be. are you...
Are you representing Jasmin?

1105
01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.407
I will have
my people talk to Jasmin.

1106
01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.576
You must be
her boyfriend. right?

1107
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.745
Okay. I really have to go.

1108
01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:04.094
Jasmin. darling.

1109
01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:06.471
Fantastic seeing you.

1110
01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.806
Thank you. Thank you.

1111
01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.683
We here at snake oil publishing.

1112
01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:11.309
we love the book.

1113
01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:13.145
We just loved it.

1114
01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.438
You actually read it?

1115
01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:16.273
Oh. no.

1116
01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:18.358
But I talked to
my people on the phone

1117
01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:21.737
and they could not
stop screaming about it.

1118
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.739
Oh. I see.

1119
01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.615
Mh-mm. I talked
to the distributors

1120
01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:29.035
and they say
the new Raymond castle book

1121
01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.662
is going to be huge.

1122
01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.164
- Well. that's great news.
- Yeah.

1123
01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:34.249
we're gonna have
tons of copies in Wal-Mart.

1124
01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:36.668
in Barnes & noble.

1125
01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:39.171
It's gonna be
the next goosebumps.

1126
01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.590
Oh. that's good. Good.

1127
01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:44.676
This book. it's gonna be killer.

1128
01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:52.142
Well. I hope so.
