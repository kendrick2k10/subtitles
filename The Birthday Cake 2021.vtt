00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.677
By who? By everyone.
That's who. Forget about it.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.005
Whether it's mets. jets.
or nets. we play it all.

7
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.761
Put a 25-cent wing in your mouth

8
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.058
and wash it down with
a handful of domestic draft.

9
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.430
You kidding me right now?

10
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.058
No. I'm not kidding you right now.

11
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.638
Located in bensonhurst. Brooklyn.

12
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.849
right off of bay parkway...
You know the place.

13
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:11.310
Siriso's. located next
to the emporium nightclub.

14
00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.169
What?

15
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.468
What do you want me to say?

16
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.511
Ain't nothing to say. Right?

17
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.384
That's right.

18
00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:42.307
And that's the way it's got to be.
you understand?

19
00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.194
You don't say nothing
that don't concern you.

20
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.559
That's how you keep out of trouble.

21
00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.892
Gio and Sofia. what are
they supposed to do now?

22
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:55.024
That's Angelo's thing.
He'll do right by them.

23
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.857
He'll sort everything out. Understand?

24
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.782
It's just so fucked.

25
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.239
I mean. uncle Angelo couldn't do nothing?
I thought he was boss.

26
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.163
Hey.

27
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.117
You're skating on thin
ice. my little friend.

28
00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.467
Don't you got something
for me. anyway. huh?

29
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.340
Where's my taste from the chinks?

30
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.716
Come on. Cough it up.

31
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.137
Hey!

32
00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.014
I got money on that game.
Oh. seriously.

33
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.936
I can't listen to them
getting beat no more.

34
00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:32.232
Touch my radio again.
I'll crack your head open.

35
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.317
You know you're my favorite nephew.

36
00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.136
Even though you got
terrible taste in music.

37
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.287
Will you look at this shit?
On my grandmother's block.

38
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.580
Yo. my man. those your bikes?

39
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.334
- Yo. fuck off.
- Hey. Believe this kid?

40
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.506
Whatever. Fuck him.
I got to go meet gio anyway.

41
00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.779
Let's just go.
Hey. man. what do you suck

42
00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:59.072
your mother's dick with that mouth?

43
00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:01.963
- The fuck you say?
- Huh? Stop.

44
00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.721
Don't do anything stupid.

45
00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.268
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. man.

46
00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.708
- Let me see some ID.
- For what? I didn't even do nothing. man.

47
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.017
Show me your ID. then.

48
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.898
Ricardo.

49
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.698
Ricardo.

50
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.696
Now you broke my glasses.

51
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.326
Ricardo. just calm down.

52
00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:32.501
Just calm down. Okay. okay. Fuck.

53
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:39.459
Jo

54
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.303
Gio.

55
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.888
Hey. father Kelly.

56
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.261
Gio. my boy.

57
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.640
It's good to see you. How's your mother?

58
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.972
She gave me this to give to you.

59
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:41.232
People. you know.
keep bringing food by the house.

60
00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:44.565
and the fridge is full...
Since the funeral.

61
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.821
You want to tell me
what happened to your eye?

62
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.918
I was sitting in the cafeteria

63
00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.380
with Vicky. eating lunch. like normal.
and these... these Russian kids

64
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.745
who were sitting a few tables over
starting throwing things at us.

65
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.762
And it hit... hit Vicky in the head
with a chicken nugget.

66
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.847
So I got up. Like. what the... the heck?

67
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:20.685
You know? That's it. That's all I did.

68
00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.604
I woke up in the nurse's office.

69
00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.991
I'm suspended.

70
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.664
What did your mother say?

71
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.709
I tried to talk to her.

72
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.457
All she does is lay in bed.

73
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.883
You have to be patient with her. gio.

74
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.713
Your mother.
she's going through a lot right now.

75
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.549
I tell you what... I'll speak to her.

76
00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.383
I could use an extra hand around here.

77
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.888
Get you out of the house
while you're suspended.

78
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.755
You remember the bannister
you painted with your father

79
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.144
all those years ago?

80
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.070
Well. time for a touch-up.

81
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.453
There's gonna be lots of changes now. gio.

82
00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.876
Revelations that you
may not like or understand.

83
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:24.377
but you will. in time.

84
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.334
With tragedy comes strength.

85
00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:31.297
Trust that. Put your faith in our lord.

86
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.807
You stay strong for me.
I have mets-braves tickets...

87
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.763
Third base line with your name on it.

88
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.688
- Seriously?
- Would a priest lie?

89
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.443
Go on. Get out of here.

90
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.037
A couple of weeks ago.
gio's father was discovered

91
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.544
strangled to death in the
trunk of his Cadillac.

92
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:10.002
Confused and scared.
gio turned to his family.

93
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.553
But I was beginning
to worry that this family

94
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:14.552
and all of its traditions

95
00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.304
would hurt the boy even further.

96
00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.595
There he is. right there.

97
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.557
Today the storm will begin as snow
and change over to a rainy mix.

98
00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:30.356
Hey. gio. Come over here.
How you holding up. gio?

99
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.360
I'm okay.

100
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.942
Hey. Ricardo. I'll
catch up with you later.

101
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:39.368
What'd I say about slamming the door?

102
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.871
All right. gio.
Say hi to your mother for me.

103
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.247
All right. uncle Ricardo.

104
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.502
Put that on.
You're gonna catch a cold.

105
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.029
Your mother's worried sick about you. man.

106
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.656
She don't need to worry
about you in a t-shirt.

107
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.422
- I had to get out of the house.
- Yeah? Hey.

108
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.052
Let me see that eye.

109
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.059
Marone.

110
00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.306
- I'm okay.
- You're okay?

111
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.856
- I'm okay. Leo. I'm okay.
- Gio...

112
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:14.408
Jo

113
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.109
Leo. for real. man. I got to get home.

114
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.411
Hey. hey. trust me.
This will only take a minute.

115
00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.701
Gio. listen.
those the guys that jumped you?

116
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.126
- No.
- Hey. hey. hey. Come here.

117
00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.953
Come here. Come here.

118
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:31.007
I would never let anyone hurt you.
You know that. right?

119
00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.425
Right?

120
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:45.055
Hey. um. what is it...
You remember your dog sparks. man?

121
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.063
That little fucking dog?
He tore up your ma's place?

122
00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.019
You loved that dog so much.

123
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.782
Did you forget what your
old man said to you

124
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.579
if you wanted to keep the dog?

125
00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.623
He told you. if you train
it. you can keep it.

126
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.247
And what did he give to you. huh?

127
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.374
Jo

128
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.797
Gave you that water gun.

129
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.921
Told you to shoot them in the face
every time he misbehaves.

130
00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:18.802
Jo

131
00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.099
After a while. sparks started to listen.

132
00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.346
Yeah?

133
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.595
This is no different.

134
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.019
If you want those animals to stop.

135
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.646
you got to treat them the same way.

136
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.398
It's for their own good.

137
00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:39.325
Gah. come on. Look. Look.

138
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.404
- I want to go home.
- I know you do. I know you do.

139
00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:43.989
But this is important.

140
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.500
Look. your pops ain't around no more.

141
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.924
And I ain't always gonna
be there to protect you either.

142
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.878
You got to learn to look out for yourself.

143
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.598
No one gonna protect you
like you can. okay?

144
00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:05.097
Not Angelo.

145
00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:09.056
Not me. Just you.

146
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.141
Now go.

147
00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.067
Just like we talked about.

148
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:19.274
Just like sparks. man. Just like sparks...

149
00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.779
Gio.

150
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:29.167
Jo

151
00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.620
Attaboy.

152
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:37.175
Jo

153
00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.839
Jo

154
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.017
Back for more. little dago fuck?

155
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:49.938
Yeah. you fucking are back for more.

156
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:56.566
Jo

157
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.487
Oh shit. he's got a gun.

158
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.951
Whoa. Whoa. What?

159
00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:06.738
You think you're fucking
funny-fucking funny. huh?

160
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.039
You think 'cause your
uncle Angelo runs this shit.

161
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.121
you're fucking hard?

162
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:17.457
Jo

163
00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.417
Bitch.

164
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.221

174
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:11.223
Leo. Hey.
I've been trying to get ahold of you.

175
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.805
Those guys stopped by
and grabbed me on the street again.

176
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.294
- Yeah?
- Asking all these questions.

177
00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.934
- What about?
- What do you mean what about? About you.

178
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.882
Did you go see uncle Angelo?
Did you talk to him?

179
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.066
Yo. chill.

180
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.301

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.157
Come by Camila's. You remember?

183
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.889
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:27.913
Yeah. I remember.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.203
- Meet me there.
- Okay.

186
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.518
- You remember where it is?

187
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.078
- Yeah. Come by.
- Okay.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:33.908

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:35.272
Okay. yeah. I'll come by.

190
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.161
From there. we go to Angelo's. all right?

191
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.667
Is that your cousin on the phone?

192
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.965
Ma. I could have been naked in there.

193
00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.917
Oh. please. Hello. Leonardo.

194
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.220
Ma. Ma. He hung up.
He hung up already.

195
00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.550
You know that I had coffee
with his mother yesterday.

196
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:55.264
and she told me that Leonardo
has not gone to see her yet.

197
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.752
Yeah. well. he's going
through a lot right now.

198
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.732
Oh. is that right?

199
00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.922
Look. what do you think. ma?

200
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.382
He's not gonna go see his own mother?

201
00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.112
Just give him a minute. okay?

202
00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.860
I don't know. I don't know.

203
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.532
What do you mean you don't know?

204
00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.156
Look at me. Look at me.

205
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.329
Okay.

206
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.657
- I look good. right?
- Yeah. yeah. that's it.

207
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:19.712
Jo

208
00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:24.418
What business does he have
getting mixed up with drugs?

209
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.865
Look. uncle Ricardo said he's
gonna take care of everything.

210
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.426
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine. He promised.

211
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.098
Uncle Ricardo.

212
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.228
Well. he might be a cop.
That doesn't mean he's a good one.

213
00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:41.355
Leonardo has been a Saint to this family

214
00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.563
ever since we lost your father.

215
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.194
More than my own brother. that's for sure.

216
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.194
But what's going on out there...

217
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.156
The cops. the drugs...

218
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.162
Giovanni. listen to me.

219
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.244
This never ends well. Okay. ma.

220
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.250
You got to calm down.
You got to calm down.

221
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.651
You're gonna give us both a heart attack.

222
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.666
- I'm calm. I'm calm.
- Okay. good. Good.

223
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:05.821
Deep breaths. remember? - Calm.

224
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.176
Deep breaths.

225
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.552
I got something for you.

226
00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.507
Yeah. okay.

227
00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.970
J to you j

228
00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:24.028
Jo

229
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:28.573
J happy birthday j

230
00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:35.576
Jo

231
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:03.520
Oh.

232
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:09.356
When you were little. your father
would always do the tie for you.

233
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:15.161
And I would say to him.
"Sam. teach him. He wants to learn."

234
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:17.534
But he wouldn't hear me.

235
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.456
He would say.

236
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.910
"Sofia. sweetheart...

237
00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:25.292
"I don't want to teach him...

238
00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.045
'Cause then he won't need me."

239
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.843
Jo

240
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.716
Mm.

241
00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.391
Your father loved dancing to this song.

242
00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.308
And when he proposed...

243
00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.432
Yeah. when he
asked you to marry him. he...

244
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.144
And when he pulled you back up.

245
00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.671
the ring was already on your finger.

246
00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.606
Yep.

247
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:50.234
Well...

248
00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:53.066
Oh. I know you heard
the story a billion times.

249
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:58.076
but it does make me happy remembering it...

250
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.827
Especially today.

251
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.872
Yeah. me too. ma.

252
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:04.963
Gio.

253
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.290
I was going through this old photo box.

254
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:14.596
looking for some baby pictures
for your cousin Marie's wedding.

255
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:17.048
And. um...

256
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.976
I found these at the bottom of the box.

257
00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.434
Your father bought them for you

258
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:28.859
right before we lost him.

259
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.779
He had them made in Miami.

260
00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.858
when he was down there
with your uncle Angelo.

261
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.702
But. uh...

262
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:45.035
He never had the chance
to give them to you.

263
00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.122
So...

264
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.833
Merry Christmas. son.

265
00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:58.299
Jo

266
00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.007
Hey.

267
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.058
Maybe you want to come tonight.

268
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.432
you know. maybe towards
the end. just for a little bit.

269
00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:05.980
just to say hi to the family.

270
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.307
I don't know.

271
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:13.150
It's the ten-year. ma.

272
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.864
Jo

273
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.321
It's uncle Angelo. I got to take this.

274
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.575
I love you so much.

275
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.783
Hey. uncle Angelo.

276
00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.583
Yeah. I'm here. I'm here.

277
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.541
What? Yeah. okay.

278
00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.044
Jesus Christ. Hold on.

279
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.090
I'll take care of it. Bye.

280
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.929
Butter.

281
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:43.055
He needs butter to make the gravy. I guess.
You know. wants me to hurry up.

282
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.931
- Butter. huh?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.227
Okay. Shit.

284
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.559
Language.

285
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.144
Sorry.

286
00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.729
All right.

287
00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:57.865
How do I look?

288
00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.572
You gonna be okay tonight?

289
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.872
Yeah. I'll be just fine.

290
00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.917
Okay. All right. I love you. Bye.

291
00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:15.917
Hey. Don't forget to go to church
and light a candle for your father. okay?

292
00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.864
Ma. I'll just go with you
in the morning. all right?

293
00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:20.300
I don't have much time. No. gio.

294
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:23.007
You have to go tonight
and light the candle.

295
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.138
And say hi to father Kelly.

296
00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.436
And don't forget the cake.

297
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.809
Okay. Got it.

298
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.358
Huh?

299
00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:37.564
You don't have to do this anymore. ma.

300
00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:40.946
I don't make it for them.
I make it for your father.

301
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.277
Yeah.

302
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.532
And you make me carry it.
It's embarrassing.

303
00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.455
I'm not a kid anymore. you know.

304
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:49.875
You're embarrassed by a cake?
Get out of here.

305
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.670
- Hey.
- Hey. gio. You look handsome.

306
00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.178
Oh. thanks. Bye.

307
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:06.384
Have a good night.

308
00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:26.366
Jo

309
00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:27.822
What the fuck?

310
00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.453
Hey. listen. we need to talk.

311
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.315
Have you lost your fucking mind?

312
00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:35.295
You know where the fuck you are?

313
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:39.296
Jo

314
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.593
Come on. man.

315
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.505
Yo. gio. Where you going?

316
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.136
Where's your cousin?

317
00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:49.811
Yeah. Where is Leo?
Some shit's happening.

318
00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:51.249
Then fucking call him. I don't know.

319
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.059
- Cut the bullshit.
- Come on.

320
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.628
You and I both know
your cousin's been paying

321
00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.880
for you and your mother's rent
for years now with dirty money.

322
00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:57.939
- No.
- So if I were you.

323
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.316
I'd be very careful about
how you talk to us right now.

324
00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.024
I promise you. I will lock
both you and your mommy up in prison.

325
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.030
You want your mom to go to prison?

326
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.112
Oh. you scumbag.

327
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.993
Just tell me. where the fuck is Leo?

328
00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.103
I don't know where he's at. okay?

329
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.118
I haven't seen him since he got out. okay?

330
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.792
- Hold on. Let me take this with me.
- Hey. Hey.

331
00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.669
Hey. Hey. Agent p. What do you think?

332
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.405
Think the young man is
being honest with us?

333
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.420
Who the fuck is this guy?

334
00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:24.754
I'm your friend.

335
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:30.936
Jo

336
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.261
Who is that?

337
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.852
That your friend. too?
You recognize that car?

338
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.212
- I got to go.
- Who's in that car?

339
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.396
- I don't know.
- Hey.

340
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.899
Hold on. I'll tell you who I think it was.

341
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.529
I think it was your uncle
Angelo's guys. Huh?

342
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:47.701
Gio. Gio.

343
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:50.780
It's time to make some right decisions.

344
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:54.743
How do you know your cousin
hasn't already flipped?

345
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:56.202
A tough guy like Leo...

346
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.083
We made him flip for. what. five kilos?

347
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.667
What do you think we can make you flip for?

348
00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:04.673
Maybe protect your mother?

349
00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.972
Hey. Use your head.

350
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.549
You don't think Angelo knows that?

351
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:14.978
Jo

352
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:20.435
If we don't hear from your cousin
by tonight. it's not good.

353
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.190
Okay.

354
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:26.194
I'm gonna call you.
Just please don't come back here.

Be smart. gio.

356
00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:32.242
Jo

357
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.291
Leo. Leo. those FBI guys
just showed up at my place.

358
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:36.867
Man. they threatened my fucking mom.

359
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.315
Listen. if those feds had anything.

360
00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:40.500
you'd be in cuffs right now.
All right. Fuck.

361
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.152
Look. just... you got to tell
uncle Angelo. all right?

362
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.403
You got... you got to let him help you.

363
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:45.964
- Don't tell Angelo nothing.
- Yeah. Right.

364
00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.465
Look. I won't say nothing.

365
00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:51.140
Okay. just please be at
Camila's place. okay?

366
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.012
So we can figure this out.

367
00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:52.932
They're cops.

368
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.476
They're fucking with you. Yeah.

369
00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:55.973
- Trust me.
- I trust you.

370
00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:58.397

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.021

372
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:05.901
Jo

373
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:08.653
Last month Leo was pulled over in Jersey.

374
00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:12.328
and the police found
five kilos of heroin in his trunk.

375
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:16.532
The FBI picked up the case.
and soon after. Leo was released.

376
00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:19.664
whereupon he disappeared
almost immediately.

377
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:23.543
He asked gio to buy him
some time to figure things out.

378
00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:26.922
But gio knew he couldn't
protect his cousin for much longer.

379
00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.338
- I can't take this!
- Yes. you fucking can!

380
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:32.118
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- What do you mean?

381
00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.245
- It's worthless.
- Yeah. fuck you!

382
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:34.269

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:38.558

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:40.514

387
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:43.646

389
00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:52.114

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.571
- Crazy.

00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:56.781

What do you mean?

399
00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:29.405
Whoa. man. what happened to your face?

400
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.027
- What happened?
- Yeah.

401
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:37.906
- I don't know. I thought Angelo...
- No. listen.

402
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.280
Your uncle has been running shit

403
00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:42.577
out the back my whole life.
and this is what I get?

404
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:46.209
I thought he was supposed to be
looking out. Look at my face. bro.

405
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.710
Sorry. man.

406
00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.008
These fucking too-tight-
t-shirt-wearing Russians

407
00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.364
came down here from Brighton beach

408
00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:54.175

and break my fucking face.

409
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.632
'cause we don't want to sell?

410
00:23:56.727 --> 00:23:58.330
It's not even the fucking Russians no more.

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.749

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:15.221
Fuck them. man! Fuck them!

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.803
Yo. my guy.

00:24:58.288 --> 00:24:59.824
Okay. Leo.

432
00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:09.793
Jo

433
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:22.636
Jo

434
00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:32.024

This is where...

494
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:54.211
This is where
Angelo got shot in the throat.

495
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:57.415
I know. That's crazy.

496
00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.093
- Hey. Pam.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

497
00:28:05.184 --> 00:28:06.799
Did they fucking leave?

498
00:28:06.894 --> 00:28:09.476
Pam. you know you can't
have that out here.

499
00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:11.019
Come on. Come on. Give it to me.

500
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.391
Give it to me. please.

501
00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:15.144

00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:22.610
Hey. brother. Hang on. Hang on.

505
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.038
Yeah. man. Hey. peeno. I got to...

506
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.582
Hang on a second. Come here.

507
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:34.079
What's up?

508
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:37.129
Don't look. but these
two guys in the front.

509
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.296
these two puerto rican guys
at the bar. you see them?

510
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.668
- Yeah.
- You know them?

511
00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:44.424
No. No. Why?

512
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:49.717
They've been posted up at the bar all
day. I've been serving them drinks.

513
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:53.019
I think... I think I heard them
say something about Leo.

514
00:28:54.483 --> 00:28:56.394
Leo? What? What were they saying?

515
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.184
I don't know.

516
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.007
I don't know.
My Spanish isn't shit.

517
00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:05.115
But it didn't sound like
regular homey shit. you know.

518
00:29:05.202 --> 00:29:06.692
I think something might be up.

519
00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:09.766
Yeah. well. you know.
Leo's been hanging out

520
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.934
with that puerto rican girl. Camila.

521
00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:14.746
So I'm sure it's just... like. her
ex-boyfriend's crazy and shit. you know.

522
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:19.125
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Camila?

523
00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:22.834
Yeah.
They've been hanging out for a while now.

524
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:25.761
Well. I guess who gives a fuck. right?

525
00:29:25.847 --> 00:29:27.847
- Yeah. It's all good.
- I should get back to work.

526
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:30.470
All right. man.
Good to see you. Take care.

527
00:29:33.563 --> 00:29:40.480
Jo

528
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:59.333
Jo

529
00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:15.761
Hey. Yo. Gio.

530
00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:18.313
Yeah.

531
00:30:21.403 --> 00:30:24.190
Tommy. how you doing?
Hey. man. nice to see you.

532
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:26.522
- Hey. Diane.
- Hey. gio.

533
00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:28.402
I didn't know you were coming in tonight.

534
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:29.357
Yeah.

535
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:32.240
Relax. You don't want to lose count.

536
00:30:32.331 --> 00:30:35.789
Hey. miss tucci. you
got a winner tonight?

537
00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:39.494
- Oops. Guess I lost count.
- Oh. yeah. I bet you did.

538
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:42.751
Hey. why don't you let gio do it?
He's good with money.

539
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.797
Hey. speaking of.
isn't it hanukkah or some shit?

540
00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:46.195
I didn't know you was Jewish. gio.

541
00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:48.426
Yeah. well. technically. no.
I mean. my old man was.

542
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.741
All right. quit fucking distracting her.

543
00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:51.050
We're gonna be here all night.

544
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:55.183
I saw your cousin Marie
with Lee and Claire last night.

545
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.165
Them girls looked lit up
like a fucking Christmas tree.

546
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.395
Yeah. that makes sense.

547
00:30:58.482 --> 00:30:59.834
You know. I know
I've said it a million times.

548
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.940
but I can't stand
your fucking uncle Angelo.

549
00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:04.643
What a fucking prick. man.
Yeah. what'd he do this time?

550
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:08.151
Well. I come over to say hi.
you know. like normal. out of respect.

551
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:10.607
I sit down with him for a few.
and then every fucking time

552
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:13.614
I say something. he either doesn't
say nothing back. or he cuts me off.

553
00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:15.696
He doesn't look at me. not even once.

554
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:18.533
When he brings shots back to the table.
he acts like he miscounted.

555
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.480
He's just busting your balls.
He don't mean nothing by it.

556
00:31:20.504 --> 00:31:23.211
Yeah. whatever. man. He's corny.
all right? And I don't trust him.

557
00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:25.630
I got my reasons. Trust me.

558
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.628
Yeah. why you always say that?

559
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:31.382
Come on. gio. even your mother doesn't
fuck with him. and that's her brother.

560
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:36.217
Jo

561
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:39.098
- Hey. Tommy.
- Yo.

562
00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:42.056
You ever feel like...
I don't know. like the right thing

563
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.544
and the wrong thing
are the same sometimes?

564
00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:44.774
Like there's no difference?

565
00:31:47.197 --> 00:31:49.859
- Every fucking day.
- You do?

566
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.486
Sure. Why not?

567
00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:55.114
It's like every time I
screw around on Tracey.

568
00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:57.446
I feel bad. you know?

569
00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:03.210
Like it feels like the right thing
at the time. but I know it's wrong.

570
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:04.706
Jesus. Tommy. that's your wife.

571
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:07.652
All right. relax. father Kelly. I already
got him breathing down my neck

572
00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:09.041
every time I run into him.

573
00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:13.298
- Have a great night.
- Why you asking. anyway?

574
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:19.472
No. these FBI guys just
stopped me on the street. asking about Leo.

575
00:32:19.563 --> 00:32:20.832
What? You didn't talk to them. did you?

576
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.848
No. I mean. I spoke to them.
but I didn't say nothing.

577
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.420
All right. No. No. No.
I don't want to know

578
00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:27.171
anything about that shit.
all right. gio? Fuck.

579
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:30.795
I'm not trying to get you involved or anything.
I'm just saying. I don't know what to do.

580
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.240
What a fucking moron.

581
00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:37.865
What the fuck was Leo doing
moving dope for those puerto ricans anyway?

582
00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:41.239
I mean. when he got busted.

583
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:44.076
didn't he lose mad weight for those guys?

584
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:45.752
How the fuck's he gonna pay them back?

585
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.586
Everything's fucked up right now. man.

586
00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:52.542
Listen. if I was you.

587
00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:55.128
I wouldn't repeat anything
you said about the feds to anyone.

588
00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:58.181
All right? No one.
Especially not your uncle Angelo.

589
00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:04.479
Jo

590
00:33:08.612 --> 00:33:10.819
Jo

591
00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:11.906
- Hey.
- Hey.

592
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.350
- You want to kill these?
- Oh. no.

593
00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:15.399
my throat would close up. I can't eat that.

594
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:19.282
- You allergic to chocolate?
- Yeah. Yeah. No. it sucks. right?

595
00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:21.863
- Seriously.
- I'm cursed or something.

596
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:23.436
You want me to box that up for you?

597
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.540
Yeah. you know. why not?

598
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:25.913
- It someone's birthday?
- Yeah.

599
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.121
Jesus. next week.
Just box the fucking cake. Diane.

600
00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:31.582
- It was my dad's birthday.
- Oh. nice.

601
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:32.961
Tell him I said happy birthday.

602
00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:35.965
Jesus. Diane. will you shut the fuck up?
He's dead. all right?

603
00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:38.843
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

604
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.635
Hey. how many times
I got to tell you not to do that shit?

605
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:49.270
Jo

606
00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:50.271
Oh. shit.

607
00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:52.899
Sacred heart reunion.
What's up. Tracey?

608
00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:55.275
- Hey. girl.
- Hey. what's up? How are you?

609
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:56.948
- I got this.
- Yeah? Thanks.

610
00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:59.155
- Dude. gio. how have you been?
- I'm all right. Yeah.

611
00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:01.536
Hanging in there. How are you?
How was Teresa's last night?

612
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.992
- No. I wasn't at Teresa's.
- Oh. yeah. No. my bad.

613
00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:08.372
I thought maybe my cousin Marie
said she saw you there.

614
00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:10.233
Oh. wait. it's her
bachelorette tonight. right?

615
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:11.167
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:13.874
God. I haven't seen that girl in forever.
How is she?

617
00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.676
You know. I think she's okay.

618
00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:18.970
She's probably drunk as fuck right now.

619
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.826
Yeah. you know what?
I wanted to go out last night.

620
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.933
But Tommy got too stoned and passed out.

621
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.831
Well. that weed he smokes
is no joke. you know?

622
00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:26.855
It'll put him in a coma.

623
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.683
Coma or not. we are going out tonight.
or your bff can find another girl.

624
00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:31.796
Oh. yeah? Who you gonna date?

625
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.607
You should see the people
she hangs out with. gio.

626
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:35.841
What the fuck does that mean?

627
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.776
All huddle up outside
of the supreme store?

628
00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:39.470
Still living with their mas?
No offense. gio.

629
00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:40.904
Wow. the hating.

630
00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:42.952
God. I swear you secretly hate everyone.

631
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:44.475
No. No. No. It's not a secret. I do.

632
00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:46.990
I hate everybody. I hate...
Even gio. I hate.

633
00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:50.168
What. me? Fuck. Tommy.

634
00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.166
- Here you go. gio.
- Oh. wow. Thank you.

635
00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:54.543
Little bow and everything. Appreciate it.

636
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:58.343
All right. guys. I got to get going.

637
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.218
- All right.

638
00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:05.927
But I'll see you around. gio.
All right. yeah. see you around.

639
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.434
Hey. you know what?
I'm gonna walk you out.

640
00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:12.015
- Hey. bye. Diane.
- Bye.

641
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:15.818
You need help with this?

642
00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.361
Just get the fuck out of here.

643
00:35:18.408 --> 00:35:21.571
Sorry that Tommy's such
a dick all the time.

644
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:23.652
I don't know why I put up with him.

645
00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:26.614
'Cause it's Tommy. and you love him.

646
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:30.417
And. you know. it doesn't hurt
that he's best friends with gio.

647
00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:31.743
You like him?

648
00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:35.622
You know. maybe.

649
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:38.424
- Slut.
- Whatever.

650
00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:54.771
Jo

651
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.774
What the fuck was that?

652
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.609
I don't know. but it was creepy.

653
00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:08.204
Okay. I got to go. It's freezing.

654
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.122
Bye. babe.

655
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.001
Hey. uh. hey. Diane.

656
00:36:15.715 --> 00:36:18.047
Hey. can I ask you something?
Yeah.

657
00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:20.921
I was just wondering
if maybe you want to get a drink with me.

658
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.627
like. next weekend or something?

659
00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.713
- Yeah. I'd like that.
- Yeah?

660
00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:27.800
- Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

661
00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:29.747
- I'll see you then.
- All right. good night. Yeah.

662
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:31.102
Both: Bye.
- Get home safe. yeah?

663
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.645
Man. gio.

664
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:37.672
What's going on with you?
You want to get a drink?

665
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:39.903
Nah. I got to go to my uncle's.

666
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:41.945
Whoa. Whoa. Hey.

667
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.948
I don't know if you know this.
but we actually had class together

668
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:50.826
the year you lost your pops.

669
00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:52.828
Yeah. we did?

670
00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:55.126
Yeah. We didn't know each other.

671
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:57.499
But I don't know.
I would stare at you in class.

672
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.425
and I thought that you would just shatter
into a million pieces. and you didn't.

673
00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:07.472
That's weird. I don't remember that.

674
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:09.675
Well. I hope you have a good night.

675
00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:11.805
- Thanks. trace.
- Yo. we got to go!

676
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:13.511
- Tommy!
- Let's go. let's go. let's go.

677
00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:16.348
- What the fuck? Oh. my god.
- Hey. you coming?

678
00:37:16.443 --> 00:37:18.003
- No. I'm just gonna walk.
- No. come on.

679
00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:19.630
You're going to your uncle's. right?
It's on the way.

680
00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:21.986
- Nah. it's fine. man.
- No. come on.

681
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.654
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.931
Hey. yo. my man. my man. we're
gonna make two stops now. all right?

683
00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:30.558
He's gonna hop out
a couple blocks before us.

684
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:31.412
Okay. you got it.

685
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:33.364
Yeah. ['ll tell you where to go. Thanks.

686
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:37.369
Tommy. slow down. We have all night.

687
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:42.465
Yo. guys. Diane and I
just saw some sketchy-ass

688
00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:44.133
puerto rican dudes drive by the bakery.

689
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.240
I don't know. they were staring
at you guys. It was really weird.

690
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:48.004
- Are you serious?
- By the bakery?

691
00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:50.841
Yo. fuck that. gio. man.
Don't bring me into your fucking drama.

692
00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:51.765
I don't need that shit.

693
00:37:51.853 --> 00:37:53.122
- I didn't do anything.
- All right. does someone

694
00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:55.683
want to tell me what the fuck
you guys are talking about?

695
00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:57.494
Yeah. real talk. gio. people are talking.

696
00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:59.808
Man. your cousin really
fucked up this time.

697
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:02.394
What do you mean?
W-who's talking? What people?

698
00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:05.856
People. man. that's who.
People are fucking talking.

699
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.303
Your uncle Angelo's getting pissed off.

700
00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:09.013
and now the fucking
puerto ricans are involved?

701
00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:10.368
- Yo. my man.
- Yeah.

702
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:13.117
Not for nothing. but I'm puerto rican.
and I'm proud. okay?

703
00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:15.995
So what. man? Who asked you?
You want a fucking cookie?

704
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:18.417
- A fucking cookie?
- Chill. Tommy. chill out.

705
00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:19.369
You're so fucking intense.

706
00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:22.126
Man. fuck this bullshit. man.
I'm trying to get fucked up.

707
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:23.652
- You're an animal. you know that?
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:38:23.676 --> 00:38:25.321
Hey. I'm just gonna hop
out right here. okay?

709
00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:26.585
Yeah. you do that. Thank you.

710
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:27.543
- Later. trace.
- Good to see you.

711
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:29.425
- See you later. Tommy.
- Yeah. whatever.

712
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:30.722
Thank you.

713
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:34.513
What the fuck's your problem?

714
00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.415
What's all this shit
about "people are talking"?

715
00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:37.599
Huh? How do you know?

716
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.794
'Cause I fucking know.
'Cause I'm not fucking blind.

717
00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:41.308
Oh.

718
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:43.005
It's 'cause you hang out at siriso's.
That's why.

719
00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:44.673
So what?
I can't hang out at siriso's now?

720
00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:47.404
Yeah. I don't want you
hanging out with fucking mobsters.

721
00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:49.053
Mobsters?
I'm not the one you got to worry about.

722
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.846
Gio's the one that's getting
all mixed up in this shit

723
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.735
with his stupid-ass cousin.

724
00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:55.573
Gio's not the type. You know what?

725
00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.311
If he is in trouble. you're
not fucking helping.

726
00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.121
Don't twist shit. all right?

727
00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:00.731
If you would be
straight up with him for once.

728
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:03.337
maybe he'd have a grip on shit.

729
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:05.903
Yo. so it's my fault?
It's my fault that he's a fucking idiot?

730
00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:09.090
No. you're the fucking idiot.

731
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.795
God. it's all your fault.

732
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.677
Honestly. is he the only person
in this entire neighborhood

733
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.329
that doesn't know what
the fuck happened to his dad?

734
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.844
It's like I said. all right?
It's not my problem.

735
00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:20.681
I'm his friend. all right?
Not his fucking guardian angel.

736
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:23.608
It's the real fucking world. Tracey. Jesus.

737
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:26.528
- God. you're a fucking child. you know that?
- Fuck you.

738
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:28.980
Suck my dick. dude. I fucking hate you.

739
00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:31.566
- Hey. uh. guys.
- Do another line.

740
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.697
Guy. guys. guys. I got this great book.

741
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.120
- Huh?
- It's "30 lessons for loving."

742
00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.789
Check it out. It saved my marriage.

743
00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:41.334
February makes 28 years I'm married.

744
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.503
- Do another fucking line.
- What the fuck?

745
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.923
Hey. Hey.
Let's take it easy. guys. Come on.

746
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.302
You guys hungry?

747
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:52.219
- What?
- Seriously?

748
00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:55.027
No. I'm just saying. in the book.
there's a great chapter that says

749
00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.300
don't get into a fight if you're hungry.

750
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.636
Before you say something nasty
to each other.

751
00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:01.292
like. put something yummy in your mouth.

752
00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:03.002
Yo. man. just pull over
here. all right? I'm good.

753
00:40:03.026 --> 00:40:04.962
- Oh. yeah? Yeah? You're gonna leave?
- Yo. my man... all right. I mean. look...

754
00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:06.942
- Yo. it's fine.
- Look. I know my wife says...

755
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.237
- Unlock the fucking door.
- Really?

756
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:11.940
Go fuck your whores!
What is that shit?

757
00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:15.072
That's gonna be your
ex-husband real soon.

758
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:16.573
Where you going? Where you going?

759
00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:18.601
You want me to take you
to the police station or something?

760
00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:20.536
Do you feel safe?

761
00:40:20.627 --> 00:40:22.083
Yo. Yo. Kick his ass.

762
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:24.252
That's what I would do.
Kick his fucking ass.

763
00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:29.082
Ooh.

764
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:30.917
That song gives me the chills.

765
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.253
Hey. cool cats. how you doing out there?

766
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:36.340
What's going on? Talk to me.

767
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.766
I haven't seen this city
this stressed since 9/11.

768
00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:40.184
Mmm.

769
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.933
These are scary. desperate times. folks.

770
00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:46.516
So give me a call.
Let's start the conversation.

771
00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.522
I'm with it. I'm feeling you.

772
00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:50.899
Phone lines are open all night.

773
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.790
Hope you're being safe...

774
00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:55.449
Yo! What the fuck. bro?

775
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:58.532
Hey. I'm sorry. man. I forgot my cake.

776
00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.409
No shit. you forgot your fucking cake.

777
00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:03.583
That's a good fucking cake. man.

778
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.504
I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you
I was about to destroy that shit.

779
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.002
Would have messed up my night
and your night. but we good.

780
00:41:10.093 --> 00:41:11.320
All right. Thanks. Hey. sorry.

781
00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:12.629
Homegrown. baby.

782
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.584
- Nah. I'm all right.
- Sure?

783
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.295
- Yeah. Have a great night.
- Okay.

784
00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:19.598
Take care. vito corleone.

785
00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:26.894
Brooklyn. Bronx. queens. Manhattan.

00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:29.852
staten island. junkies. hookers. pimps.

787
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:33.029
hustlers. cops. robbers. and superheroes.

788
00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:36.574
You don't know what I'm talking about.
then you don't know this city.

789
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:41.200
This one is for all of you walking those
streets. keeping the dream alive.

790
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:45.954
Jo

791
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:47.706
Hey. How are you?

792
00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:49.913
They having a fucking party in there?

793
00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:52.215
No. I don't think so.

794
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:58.714
I don't think he can hear me.
Cops were just here.

795
00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:01.966
- What?
- Yeah.

796
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:04.973
I can spot an undercover from a mile away.

797
00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:08.272
I know that bitch is out of town.
and she can't be airbnb-ing this shit out

798
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.940
to a bunch of hood rats or whatever.

799
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.519
You tell them that. All right?

800
00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:14.820
I don't need no cops up in my business.

801
00:42:15.742 --> 00:42:17.528
Yeah. okay. I'll tell her.

802
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.527
It's open. Sorry.

803
00:42:23.249 --> 00:42:25.831
Yeah. turn it fucking down in there!
Show some class!

804
00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:27.457
Leo!

805
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.501
Jo

806
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:31.454
Leo. you upstairs?

807
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:36.509
Jo

808
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.347
Leo.

809
00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.800
Neighbor's about to call
the cops on your dumb ass.

810
00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:51.937
Hey. buddy. How are you? Hi.

811
00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:53.234

00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:56.942
Leo. where you at? You downstairs?

813
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:16.332
Leo.

814
00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:21.755
Yo. man. where the fuck is he?

815
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:23.931
He's here. man. He's here. I promise.

816
00:43:26.896 --> 00:43:29.558
Shut that fucking dog up.

817
00:43:29.649 --> 00:43:31.230
Video game's on.

818
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:36.402
Jo

819
00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:38.175
See that? I told you. he's here. all right?

820
00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:40.155
Okay. Well. let's keep searching. man.

821
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:44.444
Hey. Leo.

822
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:48.030
Where is he?

823
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:49.645
He probably just stepped out
to get something to eat.

824
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:52.832
I don't know. man. but.
look. I did what you asked.

825
00:43:52.922 --> 00:43:54.958
I brought you to Leo.

826
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:57.461
Can we... can we... can we settle up?

827
00:43:57.552 --> 00:44:00.464
Jo

828
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.170
- You want to settle?
- Yeah.

829
00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:06.349
This clown wants to settle.
Yeah. it's funny. right?

830
00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:11.429
Yeah. let's settle. Let's settle.
Okay. Yeah. See that?

831
00:44:11.524 --> 00:44:15.813
Jo

832
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.518
All right.

833
00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:19.353
Papa. settle it.

834
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.404
You want to settle up. papito?

835
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:24.154
Here. this is for you. all right?

836
00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:25.781
Toma.

837
00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:27.578
Jo

838
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:30.372
It's all you. papa. All for you.

839
00:44:30.459 --> 00:44:36.375
Jo

840
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:38.225
Yo. you guys aren't
gonna hurt him. right?

841
00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:44.007
Man. do we look like
we hurt people. my brother?

842
00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:46.714
Yo. look at me. We're businessmen.

843
00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:50.301
Jo

844
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:51.790
You know that me and
Leo go way back. right?

845
00:44:51.814 --> 00:44:54.897
He's a good guy. You're gonna see that.

846
00:44:54.984 --> 00:44:57.020
He...

847
00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:59.548
Look. man. I'm just about peace
and love. you know what I mean?

848
00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:01.528
Peace and love. We were 12 years old.

849
00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:02.634
We're talking about bridging the gap

850
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:03.760
between the neighborhoods.
you know what I mean?

851
00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:07.618
- Yeah.
- So you guys got what you need. all right?

852
00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:09.115
Where you going. my man?

853
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.040
Back here.

854
00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.243
Jo

855
00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:16.544
Bro. Bro. Bro.

856
00:45:20.843 --> 00:45:24.927
Where the fuck is Leo? Enough games. yo.

857
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:27.300
Shut that fucking dog up.

858
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.507
Please. You don't need to do this.

859
00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:31.638
Shh. Shut the fuck up.

860
00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:37.856
Fuck. man!

861
00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:44.816
Jo

862
00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:10.681
Gio knew peeno
was no stranger to trouble.

863
00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:14.681
He'd had a gun pulled on him
once or twice before at the bar.

864
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:17.684
But why would he sell Leo out like that?

865
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:20.061
For what? Drugs?

866
00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:24.695
The neighborhood had changed so much.

867
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.568
Gio knew the people
who were looking for Leo

868
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:29.116
weren't gonna stop until they found him.

869
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.159
And he couldn't go to Angelo for help.

870
00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:34.367
He had to find his cousin.

871
00:46:39.422 --> 00:46:42.789
- Whoa. Slow down.
- Hey. You seen Leo in here? My cousin?

872
00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:44.123
- Who?
- Leo. Leo.

873
00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:46.755
He just texted me. said he was in here.

874
00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.336
I don't know.

875
00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:56.431
Jo

876
00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:57.344
Hey.

877
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440
Hey. Excuse me. Hey.

878
00:46:58.482 --> 00:46:59.767
Is Leo in here? Did you see him?

879
00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:02.521
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Thank you so much.

880
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:08.231
Jo

881
00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:11.284
Gio. What the hell
are you doing here. huh?

882
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.889
Look at this. Look who I found. It's gio.

883
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:13.823
- Hey. uncle Tony.
- This is perfect.

884
00:47:13.914 --> 00:47:16.268
We was headed over to Angelo's.
You're gonna come with us. right?

885
00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:18.499
Yeah. Yeah. The cake.
He brought the cake.

886
00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:19.951
Marone. your mother. What a cook.

887
00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:21.982
I look forward to this cake every year.
Don't let him touch the cake.

888
00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:23.608
He'll eat the thing before we get there.
What are you doing?

889
00:47:23.632 --> 00:47:24.747
Gonna grab the wine?

890
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.445
What wine?
They got cases of wine at the house.

891
00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:27.629
It's a nice gesture.

892
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.448
You know what. guys?
Hey. I forgot the butter.

893
00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:30.699
So I'm just gonna meet you guys there.

894
00:47:30.723 --> 00:47:32.701
What are you talking about?
Forget about the butter.

895
00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:33.765
You don't need the butter.

896
00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:35.595
How'd you get here?
Where you coming from?

897
00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.246
You walked all this way from your ma's?

898
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.514
Yeah. I was just buying
some smokes. you know?

899
00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:44.021
What about... what about Leo. your cousin?

900
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.715
I mean. is he here? Is he around?
You talk to him? Where is this kid?

901
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:49.526
You would think a day like this.
he should be with you.

902
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:52.074
Yeah. I don't know. I haven't seen him.

903
00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:54.152
How are you doing? You all right?

904
00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:55.702
Jo

905
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.906
You don't talk much. do you. kid?

906
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.831
It's been a long day. uncle Tony.

907
00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:02.410
Yeah. Yeah. I get it. I understand.

908
00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:04.541
Jo

909
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:07.214
Oh. my god. look at this. Look at this.

910
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:10.088
Monica. Monica!

911
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:13.592
You don't ever call me? You like that?

912
00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:15.798
Hey. stugots! Let's go!

913
00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:19.810
Get down from there!

914
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.728
Right here. Right here.

915
00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:24.807
What. you got a problem?

916
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.813
You got a fucking problem? Huh?

917
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:28.064
Go get him down.

918
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:29.816
She's fucking too good for me.

919
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.073
What? What the fuck?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Monica.

920
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.638
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry. you fucking drunk.

921
00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:35.972
Hey. don't talk to the customers.

922
00:48:35.996 --> 00:48:37.474
Come on. Come on.
I got to tell you something.

923
00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:38.237
I got to tell you something.

924
00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:41.870
Don't you ever fucking

925
00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:44.498
Don't fucking talk to me.

00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:51.500
What's wrong with you? Come on. kid.

929
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:56.134
Appreciate it. Thank you.

930
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:06.103
Jo

931
00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:28.037
Angelo.

932
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:31.711
Hey. ang.

933
00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:38.054
Jo

934
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:39.257
Hey.

935
00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:46.063
Jo

936
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.390
- Hey. guys.
- Hey.

937
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:48.545
You got a bottle of wine. huh?

938
00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:50.172
- I did.
- What'd you pay... 20 bucks for that?

939
00:49:50.196 --> 00:49:52.061
No. No. No. It's a good one.

940
00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:53.383
Please tell me. you made the meatballs?

941
00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:55.318
Yeah. I did all the cooking here.

942
00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:57.946
Oh. The cake. huh?

943
00:49:58.037 --> 00:50:00.653
- Yeah.
- Your mother. she never disappoints.

944
00:50:00.748 --> 00:50:01.908
Right. ang?

945
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:03.535
Now. that's a good woman. your mother.

946
00:50:03.626 --> 00:50:04.866
Yeah. she is.

947
00:50:06.629 --> 00:50:09.041
- The butter.
- You know what?

948
00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:11.588
Yeah. the bodega was having some problems.

949
00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.585
I can go get some right now.

950
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.507
Don't worry about it.
Your fat uncle bootsy

951
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:16.460
brought enough
for the entire neighborhood.

952
00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:18.261
- You sure? It's two seconds.
- Yeah.

953
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:20.510
What's the matter with this kid?
He's pale as a ghost.

954
00:50:20.601 --> 00:50:22.120
It's just been a long day. that's all.

955
00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.914
Yeah. Well. good thing
your father's not around.

956
00:50:23.938 --> 00:50:25.258
'cause you smell like an ashtray.

957
00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:27.857
Yeah.

958
00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:31.734
Hey. ciao a tutti.

959
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.106
- Hey. kid.
- Happy holidays. gio.

960
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:37.655
Yeah.

961
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.950
You know. when Angelo was on the inside.

962
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:43.183
your old man would send him
all these art books. you know?

963
00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.868
Let his mind escape.

964
00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:47.666
He got that one at an auction
just a couple of weeks ago.

965
00:50:47.753 --> 00:50:49.744
Hell of an investment. you ask me.

966
00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:52.830
Yeah. Yeah. it's pretty
good. uncle Angelo.

967
00:50:52.925 --> 00:50:55.028
Pretty good? Forget about it.
It's a fucking masterpiece.

968
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.531
Look at the water. the way
it's flowing down there in the canal

969
00:50:57.555 --> 00:51:00.012
and everything like that... I don't know.

970
00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:01.509
Makes me want to go back to Italy.

971
00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:02.744
Come on. Where's he going?

972
00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:03.954
Let's go say hello to your uncle carmine.

973
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.969
- Yeah. how's he doing?
- He's doing good.

974
00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.980
Hey. uncle carmine.

975
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.360
How you doing?

976
00:51:22.955 --> 00:51:25.241
It's me. gio.

977
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:26.742
It's been a while. huh?

978
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.210
Good to see you. all right?
Happy holidays. huh?

979
00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:50.187
She's fresh off the boat.

980
00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:51.855
She got the warpaint on and everything.

981
00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.523
- Oh. really?
- Yeah.

982
00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:55.091
You might as well wear a headdress.

983
00:51:55.154 --> 00:51:57.507
They don't wear headdresses.
Those are the fucking Indians.

984
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:58.611
- Salut.
- Oh.

985
00:51:58.699 --> 00:51:59.734
Salut.

986
00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:02.858
Shakedown today?

987
00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.944
- Need a drink.
- You came to drink?

988
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.958
- Have another drink.
- Fucking lush. this guy.

989
00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:14.412
Yeah. but no one fucks
with your brothers.

990
00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:15.506
Understand?

991
00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:25.256
- Hey. Hey.
- What's up?

992
00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:26.578
- Hey. you burning something?
- How are you. dude?

993
00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:28.638
Hey. Look who decided to show up.

994
00:52:28.729 --> 00:52:30.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

995
00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:35.600
Hey.

996
00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:37.650
Where you coming from?

997
00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:40.150
- Just saying hi to uncle carmine.
- No. before that.

998
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:45.359
I just stopped by the bakery quick.
said hey to Tommy.

999
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:47.365
Oh.

1000
00:52:47.456 --> 00:52:49.617
No Leo this year?

1001
00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:51.073
Yeah. I guess not.

1002
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:53.500
What. you haven't spoken to him?

1003
00:52:53.587 --> 00:52:55.919
You guys are like two peas in a pod.

1004
00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:57.416
Eh...

1005
00:52:57.508 --> 00:53:00.796
We've been celebrating your father
every year for ten years on this day.

1006
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:05.175
All of a sudden. he's missing.
and you ain't worried?

1007
00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:07.426
Who said he was missing?

1008
00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:11.727
I mean. I-l don't know where he is.
if that's what you're asking me.

1009
00:53:11.814 --> 00:53:14.851
Well. why don't you give him a call.
ask to come?

1010
00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:17.775
- Want me to call him?
- Well. he might have forgotten the date.

1011
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.317
Call him up.

1012
00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:22.693
I would. but I lost my phone tonight.

1013
00:53:22.783 --> 00:53:24.239
When?

1014
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:26.282
Just earlier tonight. A couple hours ago.

1015
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.405
Where?

1016
00:53:29.248 --> 00:53:32.706
Well. if I knew where I lost my phone.
it wouldn't be lost. would it?

1017
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.916
Use mine.

1018
00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:41.089
You serious?

1019
00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:44.464

00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:46.637
- Fucking call him.
- Fine.

1021
00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:49.557
I'll call him.

1022
00:53:54.690 --> 00:54:00.731
Jo

1023
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:03.858
Please leave your message for 64...

1024
00:54:03.949 --> 00:54:05.485
I don't know. It went to voice mail.

1025
00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:06.816
What a fucking piece of work.

1026
00:54:06.869 --> 00:54:09.406
this cousin of yours. not
honoring his family.

1027
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:11.904
What?

1028
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:13.309
What? He knows I'm fucking with him.

1029
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:14.539
Right. gio?

1030
00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:17.163
He knows I'm fucking... what?

1031
00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.619
What are you looking at him for?

1032
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:20.955
You know I'm fucking with you. right?

1033
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:23.040
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah?

1034
00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:27.674
I think he said "yeah." but it sounded like
he was getting fingered by his girlfriend.

1035
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:30.802
I'm not a kid anymore. all right?
You can't talk to me like that.

1036
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.429
What's that?

1037
00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:34.931
Have some respect. okay?

1038
00:54:35.022 --> 00:54:40.062
Jo

1039
00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:42.484
Go fuck yourself. huh? - Whoa.

1040
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.610
You take that?

1041
00:54:48.827 --> 00:54:49.691
All: Whoa!

1042
00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:50.947
What the fuck?

1043
00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:53.536
What?

1044
00:54:53.624 --> 00:54:55.489
What. like he's never seen a gun before?

1045
00:54:55.584 --> 00:54:57.074
You've seen a gun before. right?

1046
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:59.410
No fucking guns in this house.

1047
00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:00.505
And that means you. too.

1048
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:02.375
Don't give me this "I'm a cop” bullshit.

1049
00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.146
- I'm just having a little fun.
- Oh. yeah?

1050
00:55:04.176 --> 00:55:04.961
- Yeah.
- Fun?

1051
00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:07.418
This looks like a fucking
nightclub to you? Huh?

1052
00:55:07.513 --> 00:55:09.174
Anybody else bring a gun?

1053
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:14.015
How many times Angelo's
got to say something before you listen?

1054
00:55:14.102 --> 00:55:16.309
Tonight's about family. Please.

1055
00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:24.602
All right. All right. All right.

1056
00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.857
Jo

1057
00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:29.941
- Come on!
- Fucking maniac.

1058
00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:36.952
Jo

1059
00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:40.766
Sometimes you think you lost your phone.

1060
00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:44.084
and it's right in your pocket
the whole fucking time.

1061
00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:47.086
Happens all the time.
Are you happy now? Huh?

1062
00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:50.089
You drunk fucking cock-sucking cop.

1063
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.966
Don't you have someplace to be.

1064
00:55:52.057 --> 00:55:54.048
like maybe on duty or something?

1065
00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:57.100
This is who we hire to protect us.

1066
00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.179
Motherfucking crooked-cop motherfucker.

1067
00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:01.810
Fuck him. Fuck him!

1068
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:07.315
Jo

1069
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:08.691
Fucking ruined our night.

1070
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:11.865
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Come on.

1071
00:56:11.952 --> 00:56:13.692
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

1072
00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:20.874
The whole fucking thing...
You only see her eyes.

1073
00:56:20.961 --> 00:56:22.730
What do they call that?
What do they call that?

1074
00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:24.244
It's the durka? Durka?

1075
00:56:24.339 --> 00:56:26.125
- A burka.
- Burka or durka?

1076
00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.777
- It's a burka. You fucking idiot.
- I don't know.

1077
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:29.462
Fuck. I don't know. burka. durka.

1078
00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:30.918
This guy's worldly.

1079
00:56:34.182 --> 00:56:35.968
- All right.
- I'll see you there.

1080
00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:36.969
You're paying. right?

1081
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.246
You know what?
I got to tell you something.

1082
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:39.622
I saw that broad
you were with the other night.

1083
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:42.228
and everybody kept asking me...
It was highly questionable.

1084
00:56:42.316 --> 00:56:44.127
Yeah. they wanted to know
if it was a broad or not.

1085
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:46.733
What's up with your girls?
They all got fake asses.

1086
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.685
Not. they don't. No. they don't.

1087
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.817
- Oh. I forgot.
- Yours was questionable.

1088
00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:55.493
Hey. Tony. That's the kid over there.

1089
00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:57.535
- Hey. Hey. gio.
- Yeah.

1090
00:56:57.623 --> 00:56:59.159
Come on over here. Sit down.

1091
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.411
How you doing?

1092
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:06.711
- Good.
- How's your ma?

1093
00:57:06.798 --> 00:57:08.834
She still working at that pharmacy?

1094
00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:12.339
- Yeah. Yeah. She's good. She's still there.
- Good.

1095
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:16.263
You know. your father.
he was a real shark.

1096
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:17.510
Could never read him.

1097
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:19.683
No matter how sharp you thought you was.

1098
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.809
- Come on. I'm always winning. baby.
- No. you ain't.

1099
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:27.642
You know. when I say
your pops was a shark.

1100
00:57:27.736 --> 00:57:29.442
I ain't talking about cards.

1101
00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:34.656
Okay.

1102
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:39.407
See. the difference
between you and your old man...

1103
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:42.285
He was good here.

1104
00:57:42.376 --> 00:57:46.335
You. gio. you're good here.

1105
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:50.456
Sometimes you only get
dealt one or the other.

1106
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:53.542
This or this.

1107
00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:59.013
You got to learn the other. gio.

1108
00:57:59.101 --> 00:58:01.717
Otherwise. it's gonna get you in trouble.

1109
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:02.972
Capisce?

1110
00:58:05.232 --> 00:58:06.688
Capisce?

1111
00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:08.982
Yeah. Yeah. I get it.

1112
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:10.809
All right.

1113
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:12.485
- Hey. fellas.
- Hey.

1114
00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:14.092
- Hey. look who it is.
- Hey. Happy holidays.

1115
00:58:14.116 --> 00:58:17.449
Hey. what'd they get you
some phonebooks to sit on?

1116
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:19.572
You're a regular fucking Don rickles.

1117
00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:21.528
Except a lot uglier.
Hey. go in the kitchen.

1118
00:58:21.623 --> 00:58:23.238
Get something to eat.
What's up. kid?

1119
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.119
- Hey.
- Enjoy the sausage. gentlemen.

1120
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.292
You remember. you eat the sausage. okay?

1121
00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:29.244
Who are those guys?

1122
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.920
Don't worry about them.

1123
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:32.748
They're nothing. They're nobody.

1124
00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:34.583
Hey. don't worry about them. all right?

1125
00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:35.508
Okay.

1126
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:37.782
- All right. what do we got?
- I'm taking all this money.

1127
00:58:37.806 --> 00:58:39.592
You ain't taking shit.

1128
00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:41.344
Give me the cards. Let me deal it out.

1129
00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:46.098
This guy ruined the whole hand. Let's go.

1130
00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:48.771
Hey. uncle Angelo.
I noticed it's only guys tonight.

1131
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:49.859
Am I missing something?

1132
00:58:49.943 --> 00:58:51.854
I thought we told you.

1133
00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:53.901
- Told me what?
- You know. your cousin Marie.

1134
00:58:53.989 --> 00:58:56.105
she's having that
bachelorette party tonight.

1135
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:59.532
So we decided to make it a boys' night.

1136
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.280
What's the matter?

1137
00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:02.736
Hey. ang. he don't trust us.

1138
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:05.197
He don't think we can cook or something.

1139
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:09.205
No. No. it's fine. Of course.
Yeah. boys' night. Hey.

1140
00:59:16.762 --> 00:59:19.344
Jo

1141
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.431
Talk to them.

1142
00:59:22.267 --> 00:59:23.427
Come here.

1143
00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:28.975
Here. sit down. - Okay.

1144
00:59:29.066 --> 00:59:30.146
What's going on?

1145
00:59:34.529 --> 00:59:35.644
Yeah. Of course.

1146
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.446
I think so.

1147
00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:56.256
Jo

1148
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:58.049
No.

1149
00:59:58.136 --> 00:59:59.922
I've been trying to get ahold of him.

1150
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.013
I can't get ahold of him.

1151
01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.714
Yeah. well. he hasn't
even called his own mother.

1152
01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:05.891
And we're worried about him. That's all.

1153
01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:10.095
I mean. when was the last time
you two saw each other?

1154
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.085
I don't know. it's been a while...

1155
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.029
I didn't ask you how long it's been.
I asked you when you seen him last.

1156
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.506
I've been trying to get ahold of them.

1157
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.986
I don't know. I want to help him.

1158
01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.273
- You want to help him?
- Yeah.

1159
01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:21.781
Well. he got mixed up with
some dangerous fucking people.

1160
01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.780
Look. Angelo wants to even the debt.

1161
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:28.034
But Leo's got to come see us.
you understand?

1162
01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.207
Yeah. Look. trust me.
if I could get ahold of him.

1163
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.126
I would tell him to be here
to work it out with you. Angelo. I would.

1164
01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.590
He must be scared. I'd be.

1165
01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:41.464
You know. I'm just worried
that he's being bullied

1166
01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.968
by those cock-sucking cops.
even worse. the feds.

1167
01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.515
If it's the feds. it can be tricky.

1168
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:50.344
if you don't know who you're dealing with.

1169
01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.645
Have you heard if he's
been talking to them?

1170
01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:57.355
No. No. I haven't heard
anything like that.

1171
01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:02.360
Jo

1172
01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.702
I know.

1173
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:12.704
Look. if there's anything that you
want to say to us. now is the time.

1174
01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:15.160
I promise. your uncle won't get mad.

1175
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.712
But he can't help unless he knows.

1176
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.166
Uh. no.

1177
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.717
No. not me.

1178
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:31.635
Um. I don't know.
I'm just worried about him. That's all.

1179
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:38.602
Jo

1180
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.607
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

1181
01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.334
Do I know why you have long hair? No.

1182
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.139
Yeah.

1183
01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.169
I don't know. Maybe hers?

1184
01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:09.942
Gd

1185
01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:12.118
Before a drive-by shooting took his voice

1186
01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.661
and almost his life.

1187
01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:18.117
Angelo had always thrown
grand parties for the neighborhood.

1188
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.372
Fireworks on the fourth of July.

1189
01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.920
Turkey giveaways at Thanksgiving.

1190
01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:27.092
Everyone loved and respected him.
especially gio.

1191
01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.668
But since the shooting.

1192
01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.926
Angelo had grown paranoid and isolated.

1193
01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.804
and the family's influence had waned.

1194
01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:38.603
leaving a power vacuum in its wake...

1195
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.022
Leaving blood in the water.

1196
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.942
Bootsy. How many of those
male strippers' cocks

1197
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.924
do you think are in your wife's mouth
right now at that bachelorette party?

1198
01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:50.691
How many cocks do you think
she's sucking right now?

1199
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.491
Hey. give me-give me that.

1200
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:53.944
There you go. Eat that.

1201
01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:57.156
Yeah. get another ball in your mouth.
just like your fucking big wife.

1202
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.161
All: Oh!

1203
01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.730
I gave you a beating in the backyard.

1204
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.791
I'm gonna give you another fucking beating.

1205
01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:05.762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look. look. I love you.

1206
01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.207
- You're jealous.
- I love you.

1207
01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.712
You're jealous.

1208
01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.339
You had too much to drink.
I'm sorry.

1209
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:12.591
I fucking love you. You know that.

1210
01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.633
- I'm only joking.
- I know you are.

1211
01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:17.513
All right. Okay.

1212
01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.765
All right. Settle down. Settle down.
Settle down.

1213
01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:30.029
Thanks. Angelo.

1214
01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.606
I want to say a few words.

1215
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.196
Ten years ago today...

1216
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.203
We lost one of our brothers. gio's father.

1217
01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.627
The husband to Angelo's
younger sister Sofia.

1218
01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:48.923
A good man. An honest man. A family man.

1219
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:52.002
Tonight we bury our hearts.

1220
01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:55.589
and we break bread
to celebrate in his memory.

1221
01:04:55.683 --> 01:05:00.427
I remember when me and Angelo
were just your age.

1222
01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.979
Life back then was a little more
black and white. so to speak.

1223
01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:07.059
No computers. None of this cell phone shit.

1224
01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.769
Our heads were up. Our eyes were open.

1225
01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.446
And like glue. we stuck together.

1226
01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:15.822
- Ain't that the truth?
- I guess what I'm trying to say

1227
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.574
is family wasn't optional.

1228
01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.823
Loyalty...

1229
01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.284
Loyalty was essential.

1230
01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:28.171
We didn't have a choice
but to lean on each other.

1231
01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:35.262
Family wasn't something we just
leaned on when we needed it.

1232
01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:37.009
Our blood is the glue.

1233
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.092
It runs through every one
of us at this table.

1234
01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.223
Through our veins. Connected.

1235
01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:47.478
But blood needs to be spilled
in order for you to see it working.

1236
01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:52.275
And in the case...

1237
01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:54.651
Of gio's father.

1238
01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:58.155
sometimes we're brought
together through tragedy.

1239
01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.792
Jo

1240
01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.040
You know. sometimes I talk too much.

1241
01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:13.925
You got something to say?
I mean. you're family. You're blood.

1242
01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:20.929
Jo

1243
01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.143
Yeah. um...

1244
01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.108
Family is loyalty.

1245
01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:36.190
My ma. she's the one that taught me that...
From day one.

1246
01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.400
But. uh...

1247
01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:40.952
She also taught me that sometimes

1248
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.951
to be a real man.
you got to stand on your own two feet.

1249
01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:47.125
Jo

1250
01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:50.875
Not lean on anything. just like my pops.

1251
01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.671
Jo

1252
01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.169
So...

1253
01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:58.420
I really appreciate the
night. but it's getting late.

1254
01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.847
So I do got to go check on...

1255
01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.299
Thank you. Angelo.

1256
01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.393
Relax..

1257
01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.565
Yeah. Yeah. the cake.

1258
01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:13.314
The cake. - The cake.

1259
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.318
Here we are. rambling on
about our family tradition.

1260
01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:20.445
and we're all about to blow
a ten-year family tradition.

1261
01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.902
your mother's famous cake.

1262
01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.032
Everybody's gonna get a piece.
No exceptions.

1263
01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.988
Joey. get a knife.

1264
01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.200
Jo

1265
01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:31.001
Hey. This is some cake here.

1266
01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:37.961
Jo

1267
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.555
Thanks. uncle ang.

1268
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:54.313
Jo

1269
01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.986
I'm actually allergic to chocolate.

1270
01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.448
I can't eat that.

1271
01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:05.450
Jo

1272
01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.161
Okay. Everybody. eat. Eat.

1273
01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.837
Come on. It's past gio's bedtime.

1274
01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.130
All right. Finally.

1275
01:08:16.217 --> 01:08:17.570
This frosting looks all fucked up.

1276
01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.130
What'd you do? Kick it around?

1277
01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:22.758
- Mmm. good.
- That's a good cake.

1278
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:26.467
Bootsy. watch your fingers.

1279
01:08:26.561 --> 01:08:29.894
A delicious cake. gio.
Thank you for that.

1280
01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.814
You know what. uncle Angelo?
I can... I'll just stop by tomorrow

1281
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.106
and get the present. you know?

1282
01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:37.105
Just a second. He'll be right out.

1283
01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:39.232
Don't want to spoil the surprise.

1284
01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:46.196
Jo

1285
01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.491
Mmm.

1286
01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:55.625
Jo

1287
01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.583
Hey. ang!

1288
01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:01.292
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1289
01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:02.843
Need a hand in there?

1290
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.431
Somebody call an ambulance?

1291
01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:08.638
- Angelo!
- Come on. Come on.

1292
01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:11.123
Come on. Come on. Move. Move. Move.
What the fuck is going on?

1293
01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.604
What the fuck is going on?
Angelo!

1294
01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:20.608
Angelo! Angelo! Angelo!

1295
01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.635
I need an ambulance!
Get the fuck out of my way.

1296
01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:25.071
Where's the fucking ambulance?
What's the address here?

1297
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.776
Angelo. what? What?

1298
01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:31.077
- Sofia.
- Sofia?

1299
01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.909
Why is he saying "Sofia"?
What did you do?

1300
01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:37.416
You motherfuck...

1301
01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:38.963
Vito!

1302
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:45.967
Jo

1303
01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.146
Gio. What did you do?

1304
01:09:55.233 --> 01:10:02.105
Jo

1305
01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:13.801
Jo

1306
01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.392
Carmine. It's Ricardo.

1307
01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:25.604
I keep calling Angelo.
but he ain't picking up.

1308
01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.609
They found our little friend.

1309
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.440
Shut the fuck up.

1310
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.786
Hello. carmine.

1311
01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:40.210
Jo

1312
01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.917
Fuck you.

1313
01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:48.422
Jo

1314
01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.965
Touch my robe.

1315
01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:00.977
Jo

1316
01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:53.070
Jo

1317
01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:33.949
Jo

1318
01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:43.704
Jo

1319
01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:55.716
Jo

1320
01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:10.731
What have I been telling you.
Leo. all your fucking life?

1321
01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.614
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

1322
01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:23.114
You disappear on me. and now I find
out you're talking to the feds?

1323
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.541
The fucking feds?

1324
01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.038
Jesus!

1325
01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.120
Oh!

1326
01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.751
Christ!

1327
01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:37.838
Jo

1328
01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.923
Fucking kicker of it all...

1329
01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:44.597
Is the one person
who was trying to protect you

1330
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.179
is dead 'cause of you.

1331
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.515
'Cause of you. gio is dead.

1332
01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:53.228
Jo

1333
01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.903
Don't fucking move.

1334
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.204
I said don't move.
I heard you. gio. I heard you.

1335
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.531
Just relax. - Leo. you okay?

1336
01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:13.922
You said you wasn't a kid anymore.

1337
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.883
Earlier. at your uncle Angelo's...

1338
01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:23.808
That's what you said to me. right?

1339
01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.475
Sometimes...

1340
01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:29.431
Jo

1341
01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:33.438
Us grown-ups need to do things that...

1342
01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.815
Well. they're hard. and they're confusing.

1343
01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:39.490
You don't want to hurt anyone.
Just... just give me the gun.

1344
01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:44.737
Just give me the gun.
and we'll talk. like adults.

1345
01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:49.996
No one loves your cousin more than me.

1346
01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:53.045
But he's a rat. gio.

1347
01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:56.841
Why do you think he's hiding
here at this whore's house?

1348
01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:00.886
Huh? I know you're smarter than that.

1349
01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:03.214
Jeopardize the entire family.

1350
01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:04.515
No.

1351
01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:08.345
Jo

1352
01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:10.270
Leo.

1353
01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:13.394
Just hand me the gun. I'll take you home.

1354
01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:16.943
I'll take you home.

1355
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:23.869
Jo

1356
01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:34.916
Where the fuck is that gun?

1357
01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:41.594
Jo

1358
01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.236
I got to give it to you.

1359
01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:05.652
You put up a better fight
than your old man did.

1360
01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:12.663
Jo

1361
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:33.057
Leo. Leo. Leo. Hey. hey.

1362
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.731
You okay? Hey. Hey.
Where are you hurt?

1363
01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:39.276
- Gio. Gio.
- Hey. Shh.

1364
01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:40.728
Leo!

1365
01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:46.818
Shh. Shh. Shh. Be quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet.

1366
01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:49.153
Leo. Shut up. Leo. Shh. Stop. Stop.

1367
01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:51.990
Leo. you're gonna puke.
and you'll fucking die.

1368
01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:55.576
Leo. don't fucking die. Leo. Leo.

1369
01:17:58.132 --> 01:18:01.374
Leo. don't fucking die! Leo!

1370
01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:04.426
Leo! -

1371
01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:05.969
no. Leo.

1372
01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:09.389
Jo

1373
01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:11.967
Somebody help me!

1374
01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:13.393
Leo! Fuck!

1375
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:20.397
Jo

1376
01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.850
At Sofia's request.

1377
01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:01.150
I read this verse for gio
at his father's funeral.

1378
01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.779
"When you pass through the waters.

1379
01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.403
"I will be with you.

1380
01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:10.826
"And when you pass through the rivers.

1381
01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:12.574
they will not sweep over you.

1382
01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:19.042
"When you walk through the fire.
you will not be burned.

1383
01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:21.495
The flames will not set you ablaze."

1384
01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:27.251
"Others were given in exchange for you.

1385
01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:30.258
"I traded their lives for yours.

1386
01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.886
because you are precious to me."

1387
01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:36.140
Jo

1388
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.686
For ten years.

1389
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:40.981
gio carried that cake for his father

1390
01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:44.185
while his mother waited
for him to become a man.

1391
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:44.002
Gio! Gio! It's me!

1392
01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.455
Gio. Gio. It's okay.

1393
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:51.260
My son. My child. Are you hurt?

1394
01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:52.347
Father.

1395
01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.298
Father.

1396
01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:59.055
My son.

1397
01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:02.855
Father. everybody's dead.

1398
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:05.853
Leo. he's dead.
Oh. my boy. My boy.

1399
01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:08.731
It's okay. It's okay to cry.

1400
01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.187
It's okay. my son.

1401
01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:14.696
My son. you must listen to me.
Listen. Listen.

1402
01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:17.199
I knew you were coming.
I knew you were coming.

1403
01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.017
I've been waiting for you.
I've been praying.

1404
01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:21.874
What are you talking about?

1405
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.370
I know what's happened.

1406
01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.212
Trust me.

1407
01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.379
Thank you. gio.

1408
01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:41.303
- What?
- Thank you for painting.

1409
01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:46.437
Thank you for all the painting
you've done in the church all night long.

1410
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:52.188
Why are you
covering for me. father?

1411
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.907
That's my burden to bear.

1412
01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:00.953
It's time.

1413
01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:02.827
It's time for you to learn the truth.

1414
01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:07.249
The truth?

1415
01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.795
What's the truth. father?

1416
01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.890
My boy.

1417
01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:23.310
Jo

1418
01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:27.515
My boy. It's okay.

1419
01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.565
You're safe now.

1420
01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:34.443
Jo

1421
01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:37.525

Jo

1434
01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:43.303
Jo

1435
