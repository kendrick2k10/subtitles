00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:08.954
When do I get to go?

4
00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.218
When you know
what you're looking at.

5
00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:13.133
Dad. I know.

6
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.789
One 1.000. two 1.000. three--

7
00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.835
Less than a mile away.

8
00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.927
Here. put this on.

9
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.195
You hear it?

10
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:39.071
One day. your mom and I
are gonna build one for that.

11
00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.598
-  Are you ever scared?
-  Nah.

12
00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.165
When you do something you love.

13
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.644
there's nothing
to be afraid of.

14
00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:50.170
<i>BWQ. it's time.</i>

15
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.694
Bill. you better keep
your phone on this time.

16
00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:54.478
-  Hey. I mean it.

17
00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.089
Wait!

18
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.181
Wait! Dad!

19
00:03:19.503 --> 00:03:21.418
<i>...all the way to the ground.</i>

20
00:03:21.418 --> 00:03:23.638
<i>but there's definite
strong rotation</i>

21
00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:25.335
<i>right in the middle
of that rain.</i>

22
00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:27.772
<i>and that's going to be
near I-40. just after I-40.</i>

23
00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:30.253
<i>or near and just be.
I would say.</i>

24
00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:32.516
<i>uh. the first Geary exit.</i>

25
00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:35.911
<i>the first. that would be
Highway 281 exit</i>

26
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:37.913
<i>here from Geary exit.
Gary. Thank you.</i>

27
00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:39.610
<i>All right. you're watching</i>

28
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.917
<i>the storm west on Highway 33</i>

29
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:44.093
<i>west of Kingfisher tornado.</i>

30
00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:46.443
<i>These storms
continue to intensify</i>

31
00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:48.271
Will. don't play with
Mommy's things.

32
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:49.664
<i>...developing and circulating</i>

<i>around Southwest Kingfisher

35
00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:55.104
<i>All these are cyclonic.
and there's another one</i>

36
00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:57.628
<i>just due south of Greenfield
moving northeast.</i>

37
00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:01.502
<i>- There's the one west
-</i> Where's Daddy headed?

38
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.463
Hey. hey. hey.

39
00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:08.160
Hey. buddy.
We got two of them.

40
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.381
We're gonna figure out some
kind of seating arrangement.

41
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.776
Sorry. Mr. Brody.
I brought my classmate.
I hope that's all right.

42
00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:16.604
Your funeral.

43
00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:18.432
And you're in
Long Horn Country now.

44
00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.001
Everything's bigger in Texas.

45
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:24.742
- Roy...
-  Yeah.

46
00:04:24.742 --> 00:04:28.006
Put Quinn's probes
in their trunk.

47
00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:29.834
You take the lead.

48
00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.009
You sure?

49
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.446
I'll ride with these guys.

50
00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:37.320
-  All right. go ahead.
-  Yup.

51
00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:55.773
<i>...hundred miles an hour</i>

52
00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:58.472
<i>...still on the ground
to Southeast--</i>

53
00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:00.604
What do you mean
my student is driving?

54
00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:03.346
<i>We couldn't fit.</i>

55
00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:07.176
OU only covers our truck
and Bill as a driver.

56
00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:09.570
- Do you understand?
<i>- What do you want me to do?</i>

57
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.136
<i>He's chasing the storm.
I'm chasing him.</i>

58
00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:12.703
Jesus.

59
00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:14.401
What's your twenty?

60
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:20.972
<i>...you are not
gonna see them coming.</i>

61
00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:23.932
<i>You're gonna have to basically
be in the barricade to...</i>

62
00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:26.108
Tell my husband
to answer his phone.

63
00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:28.502
<i>MBQ. I wish
you could see this!</i>

64
00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:30.330
- Dad!
- <i>It's biblical!</i>

65
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.809
<i>Looks like a grass fire.</i>

66
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.507
<i>the way the dirt's
being pulled in.</i>

67
00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:35.596
<i>Being in a car in a tornado
is a really bad idea.</i>

68
00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:39.643
<i>-</i> Bill. you have a phone
for a reason!

69
00:05:39.643 --> 00:05:43.517
We are not pulling
another storm like Joplin.

70
00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:45.170
-  <i>It's just
to the south of us.</i>

71
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.694
<i>We can get ahead of her.</i>

72
00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:50.175
<i>and I'd say she's closer
to Hallam. Nebraska.</i>

73
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:51.481
<i>No. Bill. It's more like</i>

74
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.091
<i>if Jarrell and Joplin
had a baby.</i>

75
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:55.267
<i>Just pulling
huge volumes of air.</i>

76
00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:56.399
Now you listen here.

77
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:58.270
Forty-four. Turn North.

78
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.142
<i>Bill. let's do what she says.
Exit here.</i>

79
00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:01.796
<i></i> [Quinn] Forty-four.
Turn North.

80
00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.406
-  <i>Bill. let's end this!
-</i>

81
00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:04.886
- Bill.
-  <i>We can't
afford to lose it!</i>

82
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.149
<i>- Go. go. go!
-</i> Bill.

83
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.369
It's too wide.

84
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.284
- Bill. north now.
-  <i>Stop!</i>

85
00:06:12.284 --> 00:06:13.634
<i>Bill. do you copy?</i>

86
00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:15.375
<i>Floor it.
She's cutting you off.</i>

87
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.854
<i>- Floor it!</i>

88
00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:18.900
Bill.

89
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.032
<i>It's the type of storm
that will kill you.</i>

90
00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:22.425
<i>-</i> Bill.
-  <i>We're looking to southwest...</i>

91
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:24.079
Bill!

92
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.863
<i>Tornado or not.
what I can tell you</i>

93
00:06:25.863 --> 00:06:29.258
<i>is the whole sky is
sitting on the ground</i>

94
00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:30.999
<i>and it Is just churning.</i>

95
00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.622
One 1.000. two 1.000 <i>...</i>

96
00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:48.277
three 1.000. four...

97
00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:17.045
<i>...red or burgundy red hair...</i>

98
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:22.354
We found one kid
about 200 yards that way.

99
00:07:22.354 --> 00:07:24.139
We're still looking
for the other.

100
00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:28.709
He most likely
had his seatbelt on.

101
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:39.170
I just mopped that.

102
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.694
Yeah. I know.
We've gotta get going.

103
00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:41.999
We're gonna fall behind.

104
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:19.384
You all done up here?

105
00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:32.702
What about the second load?

106
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.838
I don't want her to see me here.

107
00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:40.667
Please. Mom.

108
00:09:42.538 --> 00:09:44.061
Come on. Mom. Let's go.

109
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:45.628
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

110
00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:53.854
Are you wearing lipstick?

111
00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:56.596
What? No.

112
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.249
I gotta get eggs
when we get home.

113
00:09:58.249 --> 00:09:59.468
Don't worry about it.

114
00:10:01.383 --> 00:10:03.603
- Now. I'm gonna be late.
- Ah. that's my boy.

115
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.648
- Aye.

116
00:10:05.648 --> 00:10:07.519
Oh. great.

117
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:09.304
You know it always
takes two tries.

118
00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:10.740
- There we go.

119
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.220
Yeah.

120
00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:16.354
-  Don't do that.

121
00:13:09.092 --> 00:13:11.268
Oh. my God.
Yeah. yeah. yeah. I can...

122
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:13.009
Okay. okay.

123
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:14.750
Okay. class. don't forget.

124
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.839
- thermodynamic packets
are due when?

125
00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:18.493
- End of the week. all right?

126
00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:20.190
If you guys
would like to procrastinate.

127
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.539
I'II give you
four days to do this.

128
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:23.150
- You started yet?
-  Come on.

129
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.847
- Nearly done.
- Serious?

130
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.980
- If you help me with mine.

131
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.546
I'll give you
another driving lesson.

132
00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:30.722
Deal.

133
00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:32.376
William Brody.

134
00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:34.814
could you please escort
this officer to your locker?

135
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.693
She asked for this.

136
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:48.784
I don't even know
what she's looking for.

137
00:13:48.784 --> 00:13:51.700
Please stay seated until
Mr. Keaton's ready for you.

138
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.834
Yes. he was in the office.
He was being sure.

139
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:22.426
-  Hey!
- William Brody!

140
00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:24.341
Okay. Temperature conversion.

141
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:26.909
it's in the packet.
it's important.

142
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:28.215
Make sure that y--

143
00:14:33.698 --> 00:14:35.875
- What is that?
- It's Brody.

144
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.529
- Yeah. that's him.
- Oh. my gosh.

145
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.074
Does Brody think
he's Spider-Man?

146
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:15.871
Why's he still up there?

147
00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:17.177
He's gonna
get hit by lightning.

148
00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:19.570
- Oh. my God. Is he doing--

149
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:27.796
-  I told you he's crazy.
- He is so--

150
00:15:35.108 --> 00:15:37.066
So you thought
it would be a good idea

151
00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:39.112
to get up on the roof

152
00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:41.418
in the middle of a thunderstorm.

153
00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:44.465
turn this thing on
and see what happens?

154
00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:46.075
It's what Dad did.

155
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:48.338
Dad didn't go to college.

156
00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:49.949
It's just a microphone.

157
00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:53.909
How would you know if it works?

158
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.216
I'm not going to be
the reason you get expelled.

159
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:58.827
College is your way out.
you understand?

160
00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:00.785
Do you understand?

161
00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:02.831
Will--

162
00:16:06.095 --> 00:16:08.445
- For god's sake.

163
00:16:26.898 --> 00:16:28.422
I can't do this.

164
00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.337
It's okay.
It's all about timing.

165
00:16:30.337 --> 00:16:32.556
This is why people
have automatics.

166
00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:33.993
Okay.

167
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.432
When I squeeze.

168
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:41.826
I want you to give it gas. Okay?

169
00:16:42.653 --> 00:16:44.351
Yeah.

170
00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:01.107
See? You did it.

171
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.894
Whoa. we're moving.

172
00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.417
-  We're moving. Okay.
-  Yeah.

173
00:17:07.417 --> 00:17:09.550
-  Okay. nice and slow.

174
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.769
Turn. turn. turn...

175
00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:19.168
- And come to a stop.

176
00:17:22.389 --> 00:17:24.086
It worked.

177
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.178
Can I ask you a question?

178
00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:34.401
Who goes out onto a roof
to get close to the sky?

179
00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:43.279
Do you ever think about
where you go when you die?

180
00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:55.770
-  This is not stopping.
This is not stopping!

181
00:17:58.642 --> 00:18:00.514
Harper. I'm--I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:02.342
- Don't sweat it. It's okay.
- Shit.

183
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.175
You got a pen pal in Texas?

184
00:18:59.312 --> 00:19:01.183
Hey.

185
00:19:01.183 --> 00:19:03.490
Come here. Check this out.

186
00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:20.811
My dad was a genius.

187
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.603
She never understood him.

188
00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:32.083
Maybe you don't understand her.

189
00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:37.045
When I lost my mom...

190
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:39.743
that's when I realized how
important she was to my dad.

191
00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:47.316
-  Hey! I have take-out.

192
00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:50.014
Hey. hey.
Mom. did you know about this?

193
00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:53.192
- He kept such detailed notes.
- Where did you get that?

194
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.672
Does it- does it matter?
I mean. you could use it
for your research.

195
00:19:55.672 --> 00:19:57.500
Harper. I think it's time
for Harper to go.

196
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.242
Hey. wait. wait. wait.
No. no. no. No.

197
00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:02.157
What are you so upset about?

198
00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:04.507
This is the best chance I've
ever had at understanding Dad.

199
00:20:04.507 --> 00:20:06.553
I loved your dad.

200
00:20:06.553 --> 00:20:09.382
I miss him every bit
as much as you do. Will.

201
00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:11.688
but that book.
that book is not for you.

202
00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:13.386
- You are better than--
- Hey. hey. what the hell?

203
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:16.998
Better than what?

204
00:20:16.998 --> 00:20:18.913
The man who got
all your research tested?

205
00:20:18.913 --> 00:20:20.784
And that's why you gave up
on fieldwork. right?

206
00:20:20.784 --> 00:20:22.351
Too much of a chicken shit
to put yourself in real danger?

207
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:25.180
No. Will. gave up fieldwork
to be your mother.

208
00:20:26.964 --> 00:20:28.401
And sometimes
it's okay to be afraid

209
00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:30.229
because I am standing
here and he's not.

210
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.407
When you do something you love.
there's nothing to be afraid of.

211
00:20:34.407 --> 00:20:37.018
Yeah. yeah. I heard that before.

212
00:20:37.018 --> 00:20:39.281
Thanks to you.
I have no idea who my dad was.

213
00:20:47.202 --> 00:20:49.248
I think I'll leave. actually.

214
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.989
Oh... yeah.

215
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.294
-  Will. honey?

216
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.254
Will. you awake?

217
00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:42.344
Will?

218
00:21:57.838 --> 00:22:00.319
Oh. for the love of God.

219
00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:20.339
Thank you. sir.

220
00:25:14.817 --> 00:25:17.733
State your name and business.

221
00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:19.343
Uncle Roy?

222
00:25:26.263 --> 00:25:29.136
I knew I shouldn't have
put a return address.

223
00:25:30.137 --> 00:25:31.791
Hey. wait!

224
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:33.880
How the hell did you
even get here anyway?

225
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.795
I just took a few--

226
00:25:35.795 --> 00:25:40.713
And what in the world has that
woman been feeding you. huh?

227
00:25:40.713 --> 00:25:44.238
You know what?
Never mind. the less know...

228
00:25:45.848 --> 00:25:47.763
Let me guess. you came
to be a storm chaser

229
00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:49.243
just like your dad.

230
00:25:49.243 --> 00:25:51.158
No. I never
really thought about it.

231
00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:52.725
Yeah. I bet you didn't.

232
00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:57.468
Does your mom know you're here?

233
00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:59.949
I'm guessing not.

234
00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:02.865
She's the reason I'm here.

235
00:26:02.865 --> 00:26:05.955
She really never
talks about him anymore.

236
00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:07.566
So I started reading
through the journal--

237
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.176
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

238
00:26:09.176 --> 00:26:11.482
The journal
wasn't an invitation.

239
00:26:11.482 --> 00:26:14.834
I'm not your parent.
I'm not even really your uncle.

240
00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.749
Your dad...

241
00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:22.406
There was no one like him.

242
00:26:22.406 --> 00:26:24.191
Never will be. Including you.

243
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:26.628
There. That's the speech.

244
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:36.899
She cleans houses. Roy.

245
00:26:39.423 --> 00:26:42.035
The smartest woman
you've ever met cleans houses.

246
00:26:44.211 --> 00:26:47.649
I can't babysit you. kid.
It is primetime storm season

247
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:51.000
and now I make a living
babysitting tourists.

248
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.915
and--and idiots.

249
00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:56.266
Idiot tourists. worst of all.

250
00:26:56.266 --> 00:26:59.269
But here. I'll tell you what.

251
00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:04.971
Here. Ticket home. it's on me.

252
00:27:04.971 --> 00:27:07.103
And then. if your mom asks.

253
00:27:07.103 --> 00:27:11.673
here. you couldn't find me
or--or I'm dead.

254
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:13.327
You pick.

255
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.400
-  Van is way
bigger than you.
-  Barely.

256
00:27:58.764 --> 00:28:02.681
Bill. your kid is here.

257
00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:20.133
You so much as breathe on me.
I will shoot you.

258
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.793
Here. check this out.

259
00:28:31.622 --> 00:28:32.841
<i>Oh. wow.</i>

260
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:34.582
<i>All that heating at 90 degrees</i>

261
00:28:34.582 --> 00:28:35.757
<i>cooking all that moisture.</i>

262
00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:37.280
You can't get out of the pot.

263
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.762
Once that cap goes away.
it explodes.

264
00:28:40.762 --> 00:28:44.810
Then you kick in
the low-level jet. Bingo.

265
00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:47.203
What's this do?

266
00:28:47.203 --> 00:28:50.903
Well. police lights
for emergencies.

267
00:28:50.903 --> 00:28:55.385
- Is it legal?
- No. not-not exactly.

268
00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:58.127
Look. he's 16.
and he doesn't have his phone.

269
00:28:58.127 --> 00:29:00.347
So I'm sure he's gonna
be back before dark.

270
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:02.001
If he ain't here by sundown.

271
00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:03.872
then we'll officially designate
him a missing person.

272
00:29:03.872 --> 00:29:05.569
Start an investigation.

273
00:29:05.569 --> 00:29:08.311
So what am I
supposed to do now?

274
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:09.965
All you can do is wait.

275
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.670
Son of a--

276
00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:20.122
It's about damn time.

277
00:30:24.257 --> 00:30:26.912
Hey. remember this.

278
00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:29.828
Please. you are not
William Brody.

279
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:32.613
Not today. You stay put.

280
00:30:36.965 --> 00:30:39.838
Hi. Hey. good morning. everybody.

281
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.274
- Yeah. Good morning.
- Good morning. Finally.

282
00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:43.058
Uh-huh.
Good morning. Chuck.

283
00:30:43.058 --> 00:30:47.019
Remember. today's the last day
to get your merchandise.

284
00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:48.847
[Chuck[ Yeah. no thanks.
You guys charge too much.

285
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:50.413
Oh. come on. Chuck.
We take cash.

286
00:30:50.413 --> 00:30:53.634
- We take PayPal. We take--
- Are we gonna see a tornado?

287
00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:58.900
- Roy speaking.
-  <i>He's with you.
isn't he?</i>

288
00:31:04.732 --> 00:31:06.342
<i>-</i> Yeah.
<i>-</i> Where are you. Roy?

289
00:31:06.342 --> 00:31:07.691
I'm getting in the car.

290
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:12.522
It's. uh...
it's our last day today. Quinn.

291
00:31:12.522 --> 00:31:14.611
I'll--I'll get him home.

292
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:16.091
<i>Just know that he's safe. okay?</i>

293
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:18.398
There is no place in that
entire time zone

294
00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:20.095
<i>that's safe this
time of year. Roy.</i>

295
00:31:20.095 --> 00:31:21.618
<i>Where's the target?</i>

296
00:31:21.618 --> 00:31:23.142
Call you back.

297
00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:38.505
Take it from me.

298
00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:40.942
Plan the wedding for winter.

299
00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:42.596
Then your wife's happy

300
00:31:42.596 --> 00:31:44.337
'cause you'll never risk
missing your anniversary

301
00:31:44.337 --> 00:31:45.816
for chase season.

302
00:31:51.213 --> 00:31:52.693
You lost?

303
00:31:52.693 --> 00:31:54.956
That's my nephew.
He's just here for the night.

304
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.958
You're paying for his seat?

305
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:59.395
We're not running
a charity here.

306
00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:00.788
Paperwork.

307
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.057
Just sign this.

308
00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:13.757
It says consent of
the parent or guardian--

309
00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:15.759
For god's sake.
just sign the damn thing.

310
00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:19.502
He doesn't talk.
his name isn't on the manifest.

311
00:32:19.502 --> 00:32:20.939
He was never here.

312
00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:23.985
Let's go.

313
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:32.733
Ladies and gentlemen.

314
00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.256
please keep your arms
and your legs

315
00:32:34.256 --> 00:32:35.475
inside the vehicle at all times.

316
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:36.824
Thank you.

317
00:32:38.434 --> 00:32:40.001
Don't break anything.

318
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:44.397
You better buckle up.
We got an enhanced risk today.

319
00:32:44.397 --> 00:32:46.225
So true.

320
00:33:08.203 --> 00:33:10.597
He's not here. is he?

321
00:33:10.597 --> 00:33:12.599
We--

322
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:15.254
Well. let me come with.
I can help.

323
00:33:15.254 --> 00:33:18.909
You're a kid. Go home. No.

324
00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:18.404
How's Florida?

325
00:34:18.404 --> 00:34:19.970
It's a whole place.

326
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.060
They get storms there. too.

327
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.714
-  Lightning capital
of the world.

328
00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:29.110
I wouldn't call them storms.
More like afternoon showers.

329
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.243
You're gonna get
an education today. kid.

330
00:34:31.243 --> 00:34:34.028
Kid's probably forgot
more about meteorology

331
00:34:34.028 --> 00:34:35.290
than you'll ever know.

332
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.987
-  Him?
-  Yeah.

333
00:34:36.987 --> 00:34:38.902
All right. kid.

334
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:41.079
Explain to me where
we're going today and why.

335
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:43.646
May I?

336
00:34:49.174 --> 00:34:50.523
Judging from that.

337
00:34:50.523 --> 00:34:52.916
dry line's
over the Texas Panhandle.

338
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:55.615
If dew points rise. converging
winds should set things off

339
00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:56.920
in a few hours.

340
00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.487
Should be an explosive day.

341
00:34:58.487 --> 00:35:01.490
But. uh. I'm sure
you all knew that.

342
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.796
Kid's a genius.

343
00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:05.103
Nice.

344
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.887
You want to bust my balls?

345
00:35:06.887 --> 00:35:10.108
Let's try it again
when we're in chaos.

346
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:12.719
Finding the finger of God
inside of a target zone

347
00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:15.156
over 100.000 miles...

348
00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:16.636
...that's what we do.

349
00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:18.899
We do follow three rules.

350
00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:20.596
Rule number one:

351
00:35:20.596 --> 00:35:23.817
always make sure you got
at least a half a tank of gas.

352
00:35:23.817 --> 00:35:27.299
Rule number two:
always. always. always

353
00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:29.127
make sure you got an escape.

354
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:31.999
Generally. these storms
move to the east and the north.

355
00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:34.001
Wait. why "generally?"

356
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:35.959
It's just typical.
It's not hard and fast.

357
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:39.441
The goal is to target
the southeast corner of a cell

358
00:35:39.441 --> 00:35:41.095
and to lead it.

359
00:35:41.095 --> 00:35:43.097
That way.
all you got to worry about

360
00:35:43.097 --> 00:35:45.534
is driving east and south
to get out of its way.

361
00:35:45.534 --> 00:35:47.493
Find yourself
having to improvise

362
00:35:47.493 --> 00:35:49.886
and you're already
in trouble.

363
00:35:49.886 --> 00:35:51.540
So what's rule number three?

364
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:58.199
Never get caught
in the Bear's Cage.

365
00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:01.071
- Never get caught in the vault.
-  Mm-hmm.

366
00:36:01.071 --> 00:36:02.682
The most violent tornadoes
are rain-wrapped.

367
00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:04.553
You won't see nothing
until you're...

368
00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:07.165
30 feet in the sky.

369
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.601
No. sir.

370
00:36:08.601 --> 00:36:10.211
Your first time?

371
00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:14.172
So. uh. what happens if you get
caught in the Bear's Cage?

372
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.174
You better find
a ditch or a pool.

373
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.611
Ha! Bring your sunblock
and your swim trunks.

374
00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.265
if you dare.

375
00:36:28.273 --> 00:36:32.581
Hey. chasin' is
90 percent driving

376
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:36.194
and 10 percent witnessing
the Creator's wrath.

377
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.196
I pride myself on
getting closer to the heat

378
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:40.720
than any other tour company.

379
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.244
When you kiss it
right on the mouth.

380
00:36:58.651 --> 00:37:01.262
So what's the deal
with the thing?

381
00:37:01.262 --> 00:37:02.785
What thing?

382
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:05.788
It looked like a bomb.
Will took it up on the roof.

383
00:37:05.788 --> 00:37:07.094
Not a bomb.

384
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:09.227
Not a bomb.

385
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:13.970
It can save lives.

386
00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:21.326
So what's the deal
with you and Will?

387
00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:25.721
He thought you were pretty
since the third grade.

388
00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:31.161
That's not it.

389
00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:32.467
You treat him good.

390
00:37:36.645 --> 00:37:39.779
I... I like the way
that he looks at the sky.

391
00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:53.836
- It--it's fine.
- I...

392
00:37:53.836 --> 00:37:55.316
If you're gonna smoke.
it's fine.

393
00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:56.883
I'II save it or later.

394
00:38:07.937 --> 00:38:10.592
Cell's developing here
pretty quick.

395
00:38:15.162 --> 00:38:16.990
It's telling me
it's ten miles out.

396
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.252
I can't see shit.

397
00:38:18.252 --> 00:38:19.514
Just wait till
we clear the rocks.

398
00:38:22.778 --> 00:38:24.998
Okay. once we clear the canyon.

399
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:27.217
that's when you're gonna
want to pull out your cameras.

400
00:38:31.787 --> 00:38:33.572
Can I help you?

401
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.851
What are you doing. boy?

402
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:53.331
It's absolutely massive.

403
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:56.203
Get back there
before it starts moving.

404
00:38:56.203 --> 00:38:58.118
Like having a puppy in the car.

405
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.427
Do you want to get me fired?

406
00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:07.997
God Almighty.

407
00:39:18.573 --> 00:39:20.140
Hey.
pull over here. right here.

408
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.795
You sure?
There's no pavement there.

409
00:39:22.795 --> 00:39:24.623
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

410
00:39:24.623 --> 00:39:26.973
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey.
- What. Frank?
What are you gonna do?

411
00:39:26.973 --> 00:39:28.366
Don't park in the grass.

412
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.411
Get off the grass. Zane.
You piece of shit.

413
00:39:30.411 --> 00:39:32.674
Blow that out your ass. Frank.

414
00:39:47.123 --> 00:39:48.908
Remember.
stay away from the road.

415
00:39:48.908 --> 00:39:51.693
Stay tight as a group.
And when I say we go. we go.

416
00:39:51.693 --> 00:39:55.567
And hey.
enjoy the show.

417
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:57.133
Keep him on a leash.

418
00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:07.840
-  Finally.

419
00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:19.417
See how the anvil blasts
miles out over the horizon?

420
00:40:30.558 --> 00:40:31.907
You feel that?

421
00:40:33.822 --> 00:40:36.477
That cool breeze?
You feel it?

422
00:40:38.566 --> 00:40:42.004
Yeah. that's her outflow.

423
00:40:42.004 --> 00:40:43.963
I don't remember them
being this big.

424
00:40:46.052 --> 00:40:49.011
Well. they get bigger.

425
00:40:49.011 --> 00:40:53.015
You got yourself
a classic Supercell right there.

426
00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:56.454
You can see her rotating from
the wall cloud below the base

427
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.848
all the way up her updraft.

428
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:03.939
Now... when the wind
turns warm from the back.

429
00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:06.594
that's when she's feeding.

430
00:41:06.594 --> 00:41:08.596
growing toward you.

431
00:41:10.816 --> 00:41:12.470
I should have brought my phone.

432
00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:18.432
Hey. Chuck.
you're boning my shot.

433
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.794
Keep your eye on that funnel!
This thing is happening.

434
00:41:32.794 --> 00:41:36.363
Right now. it's just a funnel.

435
00:41:36.363 --> 00:41:37.799
But watch.

436
00:41:39.061 --> 00:41:41.673
Watch. Watch the ground beneath.

437
00:41:41.673 --> 00:41:43.979
Soon as you see
debris kick up...

438
00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:48.288
you got yourself
a bona fide tornado.

439
00:41:56.688 --> 00:41:57.950
It's real.

440
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.475
Wow.

441
00:42:10.789 --> 00:42:13.182
This is gonna buy me a Rolex.

442
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:17.622
Why aren't we closer?

443
00:42:17.622 --> 00:42:19.928
We got the best seat
in the house.

444
00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:24.672
Being in the front row
just gets you killed.

445
00:42:24.672 --> 00:42:28.589
- The cell to the south is
choking her off.

446
00:42:29.851 --> 00:42:32.332
-  Come on.
-  Let's go!

447
00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:34.726
- Let's go!
- Everybody in the van!

448
00:42:34.726 --> 00:42:37.119
- Big winds on the way.

449
00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.818
Let's go! Let's go! Get in!

450
00:42:42.908 --> 00:42:44.083
God.

451
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.919
Shit.

452
00:42:53.919 --> 00:42:56.704
-  I'm gunning it.
It's not moving.

453
00:42:58.663 --> 00:43:00.099
Give it a rest.

454
00:43:03.798 --> 00:43:06.540
Hail core's about
to pass overhead.

455
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.209
Two inches?

456
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.430
Three and a half.

457
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:31.957
Is it bad?

458
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:35.351
It's real bad.

459
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.910
Everybody okay?

460
00:44:15.217 --> 00:44:17.089
Is that a yes?!

461
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:19.439
-  Yeah. We're okay.

462
00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:23.138
You just experienced
gorilla hail. Ha-ha.

463
00:44:26.925 --> 00:44:28.143
You're welcome.

464
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:33.583
Did you see
the size of the hail?

465
00:44:44.246 --> 00:44:46.727
That's what we get
for going off the pavement.

466
00:44:46.727 --> 00:44:49.599
Storage is just over
the state line from Shamrock.

467
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.427
You want me
to get the other van?

468
00:44:51.427 --> 00:44:53.255
Try to catch us one more
chase before sundown.

469
00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:55.736
Hey. listen.
I want to talk to you.

470
00:44:55.736 --> 00:44:57.085
I think we can get
our money back.

471
00:44:57.085 --> 00:44:59.174
Hey. don't even
think about it. Chuck.

472
00:44:59.174 --> 00:45:00.393
You're not getting your money back.

473
00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:02.308
You signed a waiver. remember?

474
00:45:02.308 --> 00:45:04.136
Hey. was hat a tornado?

475
00:45:05.746 --> 00:45:07.748
If it was.
we'd be deader than dead.

476
00:45:10.882 --> 00:45:14.363
Yes. I know. So you guys
are still in Panhandle?

477
00:45:14.363 --> 00:45:16.191
<i>We'll be in Liberal tonight.</i>

478
00:45:16.191 --> 00:45:18.759
<i>-</i> Kansas?
<i>-</i> Yeah. that's the one.

479
00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:20.935
<i>I should be there by lunch.</i>

480
00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:23.938
You're. uh...

481
00:45:23.938 --> 00:45:26.724
you're not mad at me. are you?
He ambushed me.

482
00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.770
<i>You have my only kid. Roy.</i>

483
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.512
He doesn't know
how dangerous this world is.

484
00:45:33.818 --> 00:45:35.994
He's in good hands.

485
00:45:35.994 --> 00:45:38.083
Damn. girl.
Where are you coming from?

486
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:40.738
Right. I'll be in touch.

487
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:43.741
Hey. buddy.
Hi.

488
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:45.351
If you want to hit on somebody.

489
00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:46.874
why don't you hit on
someone your age. eh?

490
00:45:46.874 --> 00:45:50.617
Yeah.
You got a smoke?

491
00:45:52.837 --> 00:45:54.142
Oh. thanks. man.

492
00:45:54.142 --> 00:45:55.578
Lighter.

493
00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:00.453
Trade that.
Gentlemen shouldn't smoke.

494
00:46:00.453 --> 00:46:04.152
I was just playing around.
Where are you going?

495
00:46:04.152 --> 00:46:06.676
You ever been to Kansas.
Dorothy?

496
00:46:54.724 --> 00:46:56.596
Why didn't he listen to you?

497
00:46:58.511 --> 00:47:00.556
Well. Zane's changed.

498
00:47:04.169 --> 00:47:05.997
Every time you sell
one of those trucker hats

499
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:08.260
with our name on it.

500
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.652
does my mom get a cut?

501
00:47:12.394 --> 00:47:14.092
Yeah.

502
00:47:14.092 --> 00:47:16.050
I already knew
the answer to that.

503
00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:20.315
You know...

504
00:47:20.315 --> 00:47:22.709
one of the things
I loved most about your dad?

505
00:47:22.709 --> 00:47:24.842
How he could...

506
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:27.279
He could look up at the sky
and know...

507
00:47:27.279 --> 00:47:28.846
everything
he needed to know.

508
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:31.718
He didn't need
some radar on his phone.

509
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:39.857
Nowadays. you download some app.

510
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:43.686
run a car.
you call yourself a chaser.

511
00:47:43.686 --> 00:47:45.514
What's that
got to do with anything?

512
00:47:47.342 --> 00:47:48.822
Right after we lost your dad.

513
00:47:48.822 --> 00:47:51.694
your mom was
forced to bankrupt the lab.

514
00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:56.351
Brody Storm Labs eventually
became Brody Storm Tours...

515
00:47:57.831 --> 00:48:00.094
And here we are.

516
00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:02.705
What about Zane?

517
00:48:02.705 --> 00:48:04.577
You really needed
that guy as a partner?

518
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.929
Do I look like a partner?

519
00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:12.890
Huh? I'm an employee.

520
00:48:14.065 --> 00:48:15.631
Hey...

521
00:48:15.631 --> 00:48:17.329
I gotta eat.

522
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:18.678
So do we.

523
00:48:18.678 --> 00:48:21.202
Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa.
If it helps...

524
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.163
your name is
the only reason it's still here.

525
00:48:26.947 --> 00:48:28.949
It has value.
It means something.

526
00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:31.821
Yeah. That some crazy asshole
got two students killed.

527
00:48:38.654 --> 00:48:39.917
We gotta go.

528
00:48:42.963 --> 00:48:44.269
Come on!

529
00:49:07.335 --> 00:49:08.989
See that wall of cloud?

530
00:49:08.989 --> 00:49:10.425
Wait. that one?

531
00:49:10.425 --> 00:49:13.428
You dumb son of a bitch.
that one right there.

532
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.431
Hurry up!

533
00:49:16.431 --> 00:49:18.564
Round the place.

534
00:49:18.564 --> 00:49:19.957
There's Cornshit.

535
00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:24.135
Hurry up.

536
00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:25.919
Get the mask.
Put them inside. Let's go.

537
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:27.965
Okay. all right. Start it up.

538
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:30.315
Took you long enough.

539
00:49:30.315 --> 00:49:33.231
- Pulled a two-hour turn around.
- Okay. kid. Get out.

540
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.801
You change his diapers?

541
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:41.326
Chuck is really startin' to
piss me off this year.

542
00:50:06.873 --> 00:50:08.657
-  Daphne. you hear me?

543
00:50:08.657 --> 00:50:12.139
Put it down.
You don't need that.

544
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:15.534
You only get one.
You hear me? One.

545
00:50:46.478 --> 00:50:48.175
That's us. Let's go.

546
00:50:50.525 --> 00:50:52.136
Where's the kid?

547
00:50:52.136 --> 00:50:54.051
- I don't know.
- We gotta go. man.

548
00:51:03.756 --> 00:51:06.193
<i>The National
Weather Service in Warren Town</i>

549
00:51:06.193 --> 00:51:08.326

<i>National Weather Service

554
00:51:17.639 --> 00:51:19.424
Hey. man. You got the time?

555

<i>...a severe thunderstorm

556

557
00:51:26.518 --> 00:51:29.477
- Look. he's safer here anyway.
- We can come back for him.

558
00:51:29.477 --> 00:51:31.349
We'll be leaving in
just a moment. folks. Yeah.

559
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:35.483
There's one person in there.
a there's a whole bunch here.

560
00:51:35.483 --> 00:51:39.574
This is not a choice;
I will fire you.

561
00:51:55.416 --> 00:51:57.679
<i>...for potential shelter...</i>

562
00:51:57.679 --> 00:51:59.507
Don't worry.
If it was headed this way.

563
00:51:59.507 --> 00:52:01.988
all those chasers
would still be here.

564
00:52:30.582 --> 00:52:32.018
Lock that door.

565
00:52:32.018 --> 00:52:33.672
Lock it.

566
00:52:55.607 --> 00:52:57.174
Shelter.

567
00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:07.967
This isn't a shelter.

568
00:53:11.797 --> 00:53:13.799
No. no. no!

569
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:49.791
Yeah. he's in here.

570
00:53:50.879 --> 00:53:52.403
How many--

571
00:53:52.403 --> 00:53:55.623
Your nephew's got a horseshoe
stuck up is ass.

572
00:53:55.623 --> 00:53:58.060
Probably make
the seven o'clock news.

573
00:53:59.975 --> 00:54:02.021
That'd be good.

574
00:54:04.545 --> 00:54:06.982
We're here with the son of
the legendary Storm Chaser

575
00:54:06.982 --> 00:54:08.288
Bill Brody. who just survived

576
00:54:08.288 --> 00:54:10.508
the Shamrock tornado
in a phone booth.

577
00:54:10.508 --> 00:54:13.685
Tell us what
happened here today.

578
00:54:13.685 --> 00:54:15.252
Well. yeah. Well. I-I was--

579
00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:16.644
Hey. everybody. I'm Zane Rogers.

580
00:54:16.644 --> 00:54:19.821
proud owner of
the Brody Storm Tours Company.

581
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:23.085
William Brody here is set to
join the family business and--

582
00:54:23.085 --> 00:54:25.218
and carry on his father's work.
Am I right. son?

583
00:54:25.218 --> 00:54:28.090
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey. you're interrupting me.

584
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:29.962
You may have been able
to buy the Brody name.

585
00:54:29.962 --> 00:54:32.269
- but you will never be
Bill Brody.
- Oh. really?

586
00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:35.315
Aren't you the one that turned
his father into a hood ornament?

587
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.883
Yeah.

588
00:54:37.883 --> 00:54:40.146
We are the premier
tour company in this area.

589
00:54:40.146 --> 00:54:41.495
hope you realize
we've been doing this

590
00:54:41.495 --> 00:54:43.454
for probably nigh on
about 20--

591
00:54:50.243 --> 00:54:51.897
You can fire me now.

592
00:54:51.897 --> 00:54:53.681
Hurry. hurry. Set up the shots.

593
00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:55.727
-  Hold on. Hold on.

594
00:54:55.727 --> 00:54:57.468
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

595
00:54:57.468 --> 00:54:59.296
-  Zoom in on him.

596
00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:00.949
- Where the hell were you?
- Huh? What?

597
00:55:00.949 --> 00:55:02.342
You know what I'm talking about.

598
00:55:02.342 --> 00:55:03.735
Do you have any idea
how scared I was?

599
00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:05.040
I just wanted some popcorn.

600
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.043
You think this is a game?

601
00:55:09.523 --> 00:55:10.829
No.

602
00:55:15.442 --> 00:55:17.357
Then why'd you send me this?

603
00:55:17.357 --> 00:55:20.404
What? What use is it to me?

604
00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:22.319
I thought it was a nice gesture.

605
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.972
No. that's bullshit.

606
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.500
No. you need me.

607
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:33.895
The hell I do.
What do I need with a kid?

608
00:55:38.857 --> 00:55:40.075
I'll show you.

609
00:55:51.522 --> 00:55:53.132
I'll be damned.

610
00:55:55.395 --> 00:55:56.570
She did it.

611
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.398
I got to charge it tonight. but...

612
00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.445
I found it.

613
00:56:01.445 --> 00:56:02.881
Found- found what?

614
00:56:05.492 --> 00:56:08.060
Mom. She cracked it.

615
00:56:09.757 --> 00:56:11.324
All this time...

616
00:56:11.324 --> 00:56:13.195
Now we can hear it
coming from miles away.

617
00:56:17.199 --> 00:56:18.375
Wait.

618
00:56:20.115 --> 00:56:21.290
Hey.

619
00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:26.513
- Wow.

620
00:56:38.786 --> 00:56:40.266
Go on. Get in.

621
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:07.467
I can almost smell him.

622
00:57:09.774 --> 00:57:13.604
My dad. his hands were so big.

623
00:57:17.346 --> 00:57:19.784
I'd stare at them for hours
while he drove.

624
00:57:22.003 --> 00:57:23.744
I'd wonder if mine
would look like that.

625
00:57:25.093 --> 00:57:26.530
That's what makes you a man.

626
00:57:28.662 --> 00:57:30.142
To be honest. Will.
I don't think that

627
00:57:30.142 --> 00:57:31.535
has anything to do with it.

628
00:57:44.286 --> 00:57:45.897
Hey. slide over.

629
00:57:47.551 --> 00:57:49.814
- Where are we going?
- Oh. you'll see.

630
00:58:17.537 --> 00:58:18.712
Keep your eyes on the radar.

631
00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:20.061
I'll watch the road.

632
00:58:27.634 --> 00:58:29.157
You got a girl?

633
00:58:32.465 --> 00:58:34.598
Yeah? Is she cute?

634
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:36.208
She's smart.

635
00:58:36.208 --> 00:58:37.514
That's what I like.

636
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:40.517
Cute. too. bet.

637
00:58:42.301 --> 00:58:43.824
Since the seventh grade.

638
00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:56.663
All right.
we're through it in no time.

639
00:58:57.882 --> 00:58:59.971
How long you two been dating?

640
00:58:59.971 --> 00:59:01.276
I don't know.

641
00:59:02.974 --> 00:59:04.323
We're just friends.

642
00:59:05.585 --> 00:59:06.891
That won't keep.

643
00:59:08.893 --> 00:59:10.329
You're a Brody.

644
00:59:17.379 --> 00:59:20.208
All right. You ready?

645
00:59:37.965 --> 00:59:40.577
Welcome to
the backside of a Supercell.

646
00:59:44.232 --> 00:59:46.060
This is unbelievable.

647
00:59:54.112 --> 00:59:55.330
Hey.

648
01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:19.050
You think
I'll ever see him again?

649
01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:23.445
I mean...

650
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:25.578
when it's over for me. too.

651
01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:28.625
Do you think so?

652
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:36.241
I'm not much of
the spiritual type. But...

653
01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:39.592
I'll tell you what.

654
01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:43.988
There was this. uh...

655
01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:48.645
old lady in--in Shamrock.

656
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.648
Back in '77. and she told me...

657
01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:54.868
she left for the bank one day.

658
01:00:54.868 --> 01:00:59.220
and. um. she forgot her paycheck
on the dining room table.

659
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.790
That day. a tornado
took her home. everything.

660
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.184
everything was gone.

661
01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:10.188
The fridge had been tossed
about two miles on the other
side of 1-40.

662
01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:14.671
The only thing left standing...

663
01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:20.633
was that dining table.
with the check still on it.

664
01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.161
If there's
anything I've learned

665
01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:28.859
from all of this. it's...

666
01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:32.166
any law you got.

667
01:01:33.298 --> 01:01:34.778
it will defy it.

668
01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:41.872
So yeah.

669
01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:47.051
Yeah. I think
you'll see your dad again.

670
01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:51.272
Well. uh...

671
01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:54.232
Mom won't be
cleaning houses much longer.

672
01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.668
I'll make sure of that.

673
01:01:58.105 --> 01:02:02.544
The sky will always show
you something you haven't seen.

674
01:02:02.544 --> 01:02:05.069
It's why we feel the way we do
the morning of a chase.

675
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.073
For me...

676
01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.903
well. that's the end of it.

677
01:02:12.903 --> 01:02:16.558
Well. I'm just getting started.

678
01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:30.007
Woo-hooo!

679
01:02:30.007 --> 01:02:33.793
Whoo! Whooo!

680
01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:35.839
- Whoo-hoo!

681
01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:50.070
You know. Will made me watch
every episode of <i>Storm Chasers.</i>

682
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.898
That must have been painful.

683
01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:55.772
Why'd you let them film you?

684
01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.774
Bill thought...

685
01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.079
that if we raised our profile.

686
01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:00.777
people would
open up their pocketbooks.

687
01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:04.476
He was right.

688
01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:06.957
You're lucky. Harper.

689
01:03:06.957 --> 01:03:09.350
Money solves a lot of problems.

690
01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.268
If I could. I'd trade it all

691
01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:15.835
for my dad to come
watch me play soccer.

692
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.454
You know. a long time ago.

693
01:03:26.454 --> 01:03:29.457
Bill introduced me to the sky.
and I fell in love with him.

694
01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:33.679
He also used my science in a
whole bunch of different ways

695
01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:34.898
that nobody ever had
in the business.

696
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.421
I don't understand.

697
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.293
You guys were the best at what
you did. How could--

698
01:03:57.311 --> 01:03:59.139
When you do something
as dangerous

699
01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:02.708
as going into a place where
the wind that can throw your car

700
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.492
hundreds of yards.

701
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.104
every ride home.

702
01:04:09.236 --> 01:04:11.586
you get little more numb.

703
01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:13.284
So the next time you go back...

704
01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:17.679
you want to go in further...

705
01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:19.551
and you want to stay longer...

706
01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:23.772
to satisfy some sort of...

707
01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:26.166
<i>what. I don't know.</i>

708
01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:33.870
If my grad student
hadn't taken a friend.

709
01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.178
they'd be here.

710
01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:41.790
If they would have loaded one

711
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:45.055
<i>50-pound probe into the truck
rather than two.</i>

712
01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:47.753
they'd be here.

713
01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:50.582
If they'd taken
Highway 44. they'd be here.

714
01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:58.111
If they had been on
any other stretch of land

715
01:04:58.111 --> 01:04:59.678
at that moment. they...

716
01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:07.381
I used to think that the risk
that we took

717
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.557
had some
sort of calling because...

718
01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:21.439
Because we chased
for knowledge...

719
01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:23.920
not thrill.

720
01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:29.229
I guess Mother Nature
doesn't care.

721
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.801
Then why do it?

722
01:05:37.759 --> 01:05:40.719
Because somebody has to.

723
01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:42.503
I just don't want it to be Will.

724
01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:09.269
Dry line stalled.

725
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:11.184
Take a look at these
lapse rates for tomorrow.

726
01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:12.969
Oh. you thinking about
Southwest Nebraska?

727
01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.796
- Oh. yeah.
- All right.

728
01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:16.276
- Hey. bud.
-  Hey.

729
01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:18.975
You chase today?

730
01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.498
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
For the first time.

731
01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:22.369
All right. hang on.
Give this kid a beer.

732
01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:23.849
- Come on in. buddy.
- Sure.

733
01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:25.894
Yeah. first chase.
first beer. man.

734
01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:27.026
Thanks. guys.

735
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:29.028
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

736
01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:31.117
You know about
the HRRR and the NAMNEST?

737
01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:33.076
Um. yeah. Yeah. a little bit.

738
01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:35.513
Okay. What about. uh.
what about CAPE values?

739
01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:36.993
Look. let me tell you.

740
01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.778
Okay. so at about
a thousand CAPE. all right.

741
01:06:39.778 --> 01:06:40.953
- you're gonna get thunderstorms.
- Mm-hmm.

742
01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:42.215
It's as simple as that.

743
01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:44.000
Today. the CAPE was 2.600

744
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.523
and you saw
what happened. right?

745
01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:49.744
All right. now look at this.
At four p.m. tomorrow...

746
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:51.007
Six p.m.

747
01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:54.053
Eight p.m.

748
01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:57.709
At eight p.m.. Southwest
Nebraska is forecasted to see

749
01:06:57.709 --> 01:07:00.929
CAPE values between
4.500 and 5.000.

750
01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:02.235
A loaded gun.

751
01:07:02.235 --> 01:07:04.498
That-that's good. right?

752
01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:07.719
Is it good? Son. those are
Wichita Fall numbers.

753
01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:09.025
Yeah.

754
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.504
The day Bill Brody
and those kids

755
01:07:10.504 --> 01:07:12.506
became a missile.

756
01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.030
-  Ding dong.

757
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.119
Mr. Brody Storm Tours himself!

758
01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:18.121
Zane. kid here
popped his cherry today.

759
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.774
-  No shit.
-  Yup.

760
01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:21.689
I'm so sorry. guys.
Thanks for the beer.

761
01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:23.517
Um. I--I should go.

762
01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:25.911
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

763
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:29.045
You don't know who this is?

764
01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.438
You're disrespecting
his old man?

765
01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:34.398
This is Bill Brody's son!

766
01:07:35.442 --> 01:07:38.967
Wait. you're the kid?

767
01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:42.275
I heard that you rode one out
in a phone booth.

768
01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:46.192
Hey. your father's a legend.

769
01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:53.069
This kid's parents are
the reason I started chasing.

770
01:07:54.026 --> 01:07:55.375
Did you know that?

771
01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:58.030
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

772
01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.163
Wow.
The probes they engineered.

773
01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:02.861
Yeah. They--they still hold
the record for most intercepts.

774
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:05.994
Boy. your mom has some brass.

775
01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:07.561
We used to call her
the Mama Bear

776
01:08:07.561 --> 01:08:10.086
because of all the time
she spent in that Bear's Cage.

777
01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:13.915
Nobody collects data there
unless it's by accident.

778
01:08:13.915 --> 01:08:15.961
Yeah. except for the Brodys.

779
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.795
Bill Brody did things
nobody else dared to do

780
01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:25.840
and he did 'em
again and again.

781
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.929
I mean. he pulled off
the moon landing

782
01:08:27.929 --> 01:08:29.931
with nothing more than
a high school diploma.

783
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:33.152
Now how does somebody like that
ever get into money trouble?

784
01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:35.285
I--I don't follow.

785
01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:37.417
Science love scientists.

786
01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:38.984
Even though
your dad had your mom.

787
01:08:38.984 --> 01:08:40.594
he was always
gonna be an outsider.

788
01:08:40.594 --> 01:08:43.684
People love labels. It's easier.

789
01:08:43.684 --> 01:08:45.251
To them. he was...

790
01:08:45.251 --> 01:08:47.166
an adrenaline junkie.

791
01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:49.473
- Just like the rest of us.
- Cheers.

792
01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:51.301
- Why can't you be both?

793
01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:53.912
Well...

794
01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.783
when you're ready
to prove them wrong.

795
01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:57.176
you know where to find me.

796
01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.702
Anyway...

797
01:09:03.356 --> 01:09:05.880
I need my hat here. boy.

798
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.275
I got me a van
full of new troops in the AM

799
01:09:09.275 --> 01:09:12.278
and I don't have
an effing driver. Gawd!

800
01:09:12.278 --> 01:09:14.150
Ah. I should probably
head out too. guys.

801
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:16.413
All right. well. hey. boys.

802
01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:18.023
Y'all be safe tomorrow.

803
01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:20.286
If those Southwesterlies
get backed by the southeast...

804
01:09:20.286 --> 01:09:22.114
Wake up. Whoo!

805
01:09:22.114 --> 01:09:23.681
Don't become friends with them.

806
01:09:23.681 --> 01:09:26.336
They're gonna be dead
by the end of the month.

807
01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:28.468
-  Son of a bitch.

808
01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:29.687
Hey.

809
01:09:30.427 --> 01:09:31.689
Hey!

810
01:09:32.472 --> 01:09:33.517
Wait.

811
01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:39.305
Why did you tel me all that?

812
01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:41.438
I meant everything I said.

813
01:09:42.656 --> 01:09:44.310
But there's a dark side to this.

814
01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.530
and your father
crossed over from time to time.

815
01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:48.096
Shit. we all have.

816
01:09:48.096 --> 01:09:51.143
But he never lost sight
of what was important.

817
01:09:55.974 --> 01:09:57.367
Nice watch.

818
01:09:58.281 --> 01:09:59.717
Battle scars.

819
01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.937
I dig it.

820
01:10:29.573 --> 01:10:31.357
We were all laughing.

821
01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:40.279
Hey.

822
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.676
That's Bill Brody's son.

823
01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.333
It's your fan club.

824
01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:55.381
What's happening?

825
01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:57.296
Ghost of a giant. kid.

826
01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.776
Follow me.

827
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:21.146
- Are you some sort of celebrity?

828
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:27.370
So. what can I get you fellas?

829
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:31.287
I am gonna have the world-famous
huevos rancheros. please.

830
01:11:32.897 --> 01:11:33.854
You know what?

831
01:11:33.854 --> 01:11:35.769
Make it two.

832
01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:43.255
I hate to be a bother.
but how bad is it gonna get?

833
01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:44.691
Where do you live?

834
01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:47.085
Well. I'm just a couple
of miles down the road.

835
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.522
But my sister lives up in Colby.

836
01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:51.524
- Does she have a shelter?
- Yes. sir.

837
01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:52.917
Tell her to stay near it.

838
01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:54.353
The storms are probably
going to clear

839
01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:56.921
to the northeast.
but best be safe.

840
01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:03.014
I used my dad's concept
as a guide.

841
01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:12.589
So. uh. when I reviewed
the models...

842
01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:14.634
-  Hey. new reports out.
-  ...it all clicked.

843
01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:16.506
-  What does it say?
-  Imperial. yeah.

844
01:12:16.506 --> 01:12:18.943
-  Oh. really?
-  Hey. hey.
Southwest Nebraska.

845
01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:20.336
Well. don't wait for us!
Let's go!

846
01:12:29.519 --> 01:12:32.696
No. no. no.
Your mom is meeting us here.

847
01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:35.263
And she's on her way.
Until then. we stay put.

848
01:12:35.263 --> 01:12:37.570
How does she know where I was?

849
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:40.312
You're my responsibility
until you become your mom's.

850
01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:42.880
so sit your ass down.

851
01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:46.231
Don't wait. bro. Let's go.

852
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:47.841
Roy Cameron.

853
01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:51.845
Just wait.

854
01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:54.152
If you taste those
huevos rancheros.

855
01:12:54.152 --> 01:12:55.806
it'll change your life.

856
01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:59.113
Hey. get outta there.
You're being a dick. Let's go.

857
01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:01.377
You boys ready? Let's go.

858
01:13:07.078 --> 01:13:10.429
Got a high roller today.
bought out the tour.

859
01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:12.431
Can't afford to worry about
an intercept now.

860
01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:15.391
Just get me within range.
I need this.

861
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.829
And think of the story;
it'll tell itself.

862
01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:21.092
Okay. The next few hours.
I'm God.

863
01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:23.529
Whatever I say goes. All right?

864
01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:26.010
Have you ever heard of
plausible deniability?

865
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:27.359
Every day.

866
01:13:27.359 --> 01:13:29.056
- I'm serious.

867
01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:30.928
If you're tired of
messing around.

868
01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:32.625
being a tour operator...

869
01:13:34.148 --> 01:13:35.411
give me a call.

870
01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:40.677
- Say hi to Kim for me.
- I will.

871
01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.214
Not again.

872
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:28.942
Mr. Khan.
you're in for a treat today.

873
01:14:28.942 --> 01:14:31.292
We've got the son of the
legendary Storm Chaser.

874
01:14:31.292 --> 01:14:33.207
Bill Brody.
riding along with us.

875
01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:40.258
Big Bill. The Dalai Lama
of storm chasers.

876
01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:46.177
What did he say?

877
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:48.571
You like history?

878
01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.876
I love history.

879
01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:52.879
In 1949. a guy named
Dr. Horace Byers

880
01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:55.273
was hired by
the government to find out why

881
01:14:55.273 --> 01:14:58.885
commercial airliners
were falling out of the sky.

882
01:14:58.885 --> 01:15:01.584
He got some fighter pilots
to fly their jets

883
01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:03.542
through thunderstorms
and they discovered

884
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:06.502
that nearly all storms
are like lungs.

885
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.721
One breath in. one breath out. Simple.

886
01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:12.420
But there was an outlier.

887
01:15:13.813 --> 01:15:15.511
Under the right conditions.

888
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:18.078
there was a particular storm
that would rotate its rain

889
01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:19.471
out of its throat.

890
01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:22.518
allowing it
to breathe in and out...

891
01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.649
for hours.

892
01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:25.782
You know what he called it?

893
01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:28.654
Supercell.

894
01:15:31.788 --> 01:15:32.919
Good boy.

895
01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:54.462
Roy. Uh-huh.

896
01:15:57.117 --> 01:15:58.423
Hello. Roy.

897
01:15:58.423 --> 01:16:00.817
- He abducted me.
- Uh-huh. I'm sure.

898
01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:03.559
You look...

899
01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.563
like a whole person still.

900
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.868
Gee. thanks.

901
01:16:08.868 --> 01:16:10.217
Where's my son
before I castrate you?

902
01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:11.741
Really? In front of the kid?

903
01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.220
I'm 17.

904
01:16:14.874 --> 01:16:17.442
You're the heartbreaker
since the seventh grade.

905
01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:18.574
Where's my son. Roy?

906
01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:44.121
We haven't seen storm
as severe as this before.

907
01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:18.242
Does that tin can work?

908
01:17:25.075 --> 01:17:26.685
<i>Zane. come in.</i>

909
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.121
<i>You got William Brody
with you?</i>

910
01:17:28.121 --> 01:17:30.341
<i>-</i> [William] Shit.

911
01:17:30.341 --> 01:17:32.299
Hey. hey. hey. Careful.

912
01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:36.303
Put it back in the van.
Let's go.

913
01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.271
can't believe it.

914
01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:49.055
You're still pulling
the same shit

915
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:50.361
that you did ten years ago?

916
01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:51.710
Why don't you just eliminate me?

917
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:54.017
You're so good at
eliminating the Brodys.

918
01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:55.714
You know. if it wasn't for me.

919
01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:58.935
Bill would have checked out
long before Wichita Falls.

920
01:17:58.935 --> 01:18:00.806
I took on that man's load

921
01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:03.679
while you stayed at home
playing keyboard cowboy!

922
01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.376
I was raising our son. Roy.

923
01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:07.117
But I stayed here!

924
01:18:07.987 --> 01:18:10.033
I was here...

925
01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:12.644
trying to--to
preserve something.

926
01:18:12.644 --> 01:18:13.906
And I gotta tell you
something. Quinn.

927
01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.778
Your son?

928
01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:17.867
He is one of us.

929
01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:20.957
You had no right to give him
that journal. Roy.

930
01:18:20.957 --> 01:18:22.523
He loves you. Quinn.

931
01:18:22.523 --> 01:18:24.874
but you can't put a collar
on a no-collar dog

932
01:18:24.874 --> 01:18:26.832
- and expect him to be happy.
- Hey!

933
01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:29.748
Shouldn't we be chasing?

934
01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:34.710
I'll drive my husband's truck.

935
01:18:40.237 --> 01:18:42.543
- You getting in?

936
01:19:05.784 --> 01:19:08.831
Buckle up. We're going to war.

937
01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.486
So exciting to be here.

938
01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:17.013
So exciting to be here.

939
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.337
-  Anything?

940
01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:02.275
I thought Imperial
was the target.

941
01:20:02.275 --> 01:20:04.843
Not for deployment.

942
01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:06.627
But we don't need to get close
with the microphone.

943
01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:08.891
The whole point is that we can
do it from a safe distance.

944
01:20:08.891 --> 01:20:11.545
Come on. son. We're cowboys.
just like your dad.

945
01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:29.389
The place they're going to
is very dangerous.

946
01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:06.949
Oh. God.

947
01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:37.153
Find me an East route
or we're gonna lose it.

948
01:21:37.153 --> 01:21:38.371
No. we're too close.

949
01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:40.896
We're not too close.
East route. now!

950
01:21:44.943 --> 01:21:47.250
It's very bumpy.

951
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:49.861
There's no pavement
for another two miles.

952
01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:51.558
I don't need pavement.

953
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.347
They feel
this is the correct route.

954
01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:06.530
Always follow the good air.

955
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.967
Get your phones ready.

956
01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.578
Oh. no.

957
01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:18.542
They're driving recklessly.

958
01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:32.469
Our escape route
is around the bend.

959
01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:34.688
about one mile. Highway 33.

960
01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:36.212
Now's your chance. Let's go.

961
01:22:40.303 --> 01:22:41.782
We're inside.

962
01:22:43.915 --> 01:22:46.048
Major Tom. why don't you put
your headphones on

963
01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:47.745
and find me a pulse.

964
01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.013
Don't be scared.

965
01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:58.016
We haven't lost anyone yet.

966
01:22:58.016 --> 01:23:00.105
Leave me alone. Yeah.

967
01:23:33.095 --> 01:23:35.053
Just keep your eyes
up there. you understand?

968
01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:36.359
Oh. no.

969
01:23:38.056 --> 01:23:40.754
Hey. never mind that.
it's just the RFD.

970
01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.931
Where the hell you going?

971
01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:44.992
Get in!

972
01:24:44.992 --> 01:24:46.907
And close that door!

973
01:24:51.869 --> 01:24:54.219
Hey. Roy. Please come in.
Do you copy?

974
01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:57.309
We're on a dirt road
about a mile west of Exit 33.

975
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:00.356
Let's go.

976
01:25:00.356 --> 01:25:02.314
-  Go forward!

977
01:25:02.314 --> 01:25:03.620
Hey. I'm gonna push.

978
01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:08.407
You drive.
I'll get out and push.

979
01:25:08.407 --> 01:25:10.192
When I give you the thumbs up.

980
01:25:10.192 --> 01:25:12.107
you start to ease back.

981
01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.412
Okay?

982
01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:43.181
Keep it spinning.
Keep it spinning.

983
01:25:49.013 --> 01:25:51.320
Come on.
Come on!

984
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.713
-  Come on!

985
01:25:58.979 --> 01:26:00.111
Oh. my God.

986
01:26:33.144 --> 01:26:34.232
No!

987
01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:36.756
Get in. Get in.

988
01:26:36.756 --> 01:26:38.758
Reverse! Reverse!

989
01:26:38.758 --> 01:26:41.239
Ah! Can you even drive?

990
01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:43.415
I absolutely cannot!

991
01:26:49.639 --> 01:26:51.206
Heads down!

992
01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:04.349
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

993
01:27:04.349 --> 01:27:06.177
<i>You're in the Bear's Cage!</i>

994
01:27:13.184 --> 01:27:15.491
<i>We're heading down 33!</i>

995
01:27:15.491 --> 01:27:18.145
<i>- Which mile marker are you on?</i>
- I'm going backwards here.

996
01:27:18.145 --> 01:27:19.669
How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

997
01:27:28.634 --> 01:27:31.071
Brake! Brake!

998
01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:41.517
- William!
- Mom?

999
01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:48.088
- Mom!
-  Move over.

1000
01:27:52.136 --> 01:27:54.094
-  <i>Follow us.</i>

1001
01:28:01.493 --> 01:28:03.103
Where's Zane?

1002
01:28:04.496 --> 01:28:05.845
Why were you driving?

1003
01:28:07.673 --> 01:28:09.501
The tornado was
right on top of us.

1004
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:15.290
It's okay.

1005
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:18.249
I'm here with you now.
It's okay.

1006
01:28:20.599 --> 01:28:21.774
Hey.

1007
01:28:23.341 --> 01:28:24.951
It's gonna be all right.

1008
01:28:24.951 --> 01:28:26.779
<i>South storm
ate the North storm.</i>

1009
01:28:26.779 --> 01:28:28.564
The low-level jet
just kicked in.

1010
01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:33.656
Well. at least
it's stopped raining.

1011
01:28:33.656 --> 01:28:35.135
That's good. right?

1012
01:28:35.135 --> 01:28:36.311
No.

1013
01:28:38.835 --> 01:28:40.358
<i>We're still in the cage.</i>

1014
01:28:40.358 --> 01:28:41.838
<i>If we get through McCook.</i>

1015
01:28:41.838 --> 01:28:43.448
<i>we got a South route.
two miles.</i>

1016
01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:50.325
That... that whole thing's
a tornado?

1017
01:28:57.984 --> 01:29:00.335
Mom. Fuel. we're low.

1018
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:03.773
Forget the South route.
We need a shelter now.

1019
01:29:03.773 --> 01:29:05.905
- The Victory Christian Academy.

1020
01:29:05.905 --> 01:29:08.386
it's two blocks North.
three blocks East.

1021
01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.184
Where is it. Roy?

1022
01:29:24.184 --> 01:29:25.534
Hey. over there.

1023
01:29:25.534 --> 01:29:27.362
- Turn around! Turn around!
-  <i>On it.</i>

1024
01:29:40.679 --> 01:29:42.377
<i>We're out of gas.</i>

1025
01:29:43.943 --> 01:29:45.380
You all right?

1026
01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:53.910
Harper! Take this. Get inside.

1027
01:29:59.568 --> 01:30:01.091
Tour is over. Let's go.

1028
01:30:01.091 --> 01:30:04.660
Please move! Let's go.

1029
01:30:06.966 --> 01:30:08.925
-  Come on!

1030
01:30:12.058 --> 01:30:14.452
No. no. Come on.

1031
01:30:15.714 --> 01:30:16.889
What are you doing?

1032
01:30:16.889 --> 01:30:18.238
Dad's journal is under the seat.

1033
01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:19.544
What? What?

1034
01:30:26.203 --> 01:30:27.334
Get in here!

1035
01:30:27.334 --> 01:30:28.901
Is Will in there?

1036
01:30:28.901 --> 01:30:30.512
There's no time for that.

1037
01:30:30.512 --> 01:30:33.123
- No. I can't leave it.
- Look. hey! Let it go.

1038
01:30:35.995 --> 01:30:37.170
I'm stuck.

1039
01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:39.042
-  What?
-  I'm stuck.

1040
01:30:43.525 --> 01:30:45.178
It's your watch! Your watch!

1041
01:30:45.178 --> 01:30:47.050
Undo it! Undo it!

1042
01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:48.834
- Come on. Undo it.
-  It's stuck.

1043
01:30:48.834 --> 01:30:50.140
Will!

1044
01:30:56.276 --> 01:30:57.974
Will!

1045
01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:02.195
Come inside! You're gonna die.

1046
01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:05.416
Roy!

1047
01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:06.809
Where are you going?

1048
01:31:11.422 --> 01:31:12.597
-  Will!

1049
01:31:12.597 --> 01:31:14.381
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1050
01:31:14.381 --> 01:31:17.515
-  I think
I broke something.
-  You okay?

1051
01:31:17.515 --> 01:31:19.735
You're gonna make it.

1052
01:31:21.867 --> 01:31:23.608
Oh. my God.

1053
01:31:27.743 --> 01:31:29.135
The pool.

1054
01:31:34.401 --> 01:31:36.969
All right. All right.

1055
01:31:42.758 --> 01:31:45.543
Hold your breath.
Hold your breath.

1056
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:22.624
On my count. ready?

1057
01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:25.844
- One. two. three.

1058
01:32:37.377 --> 01:32:39.249
How'd y'all plan on
getting home?

1059
01:32:40.076 --> 01:32:41.686
I don't know.

1060
01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:43.079
Haven't thought about it.

1061
01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:06.406
Well. at least you know
how to drive now.

1062
01:33:56.282 --> 01:33:57.588
I lost it.

1063
01:33:59.503 --> 01:34:00.765
We can build another.

1064
01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.639
Your dad would be proud.

1065
01:34:06.031 --> 01:34:07.467
I did it for you.
