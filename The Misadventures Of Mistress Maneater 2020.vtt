3
00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:16.357
- Help me.

4
00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:20.327
- That's not your safe word.

5
00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:21.862
I need your safe word. Frank.

6
00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.535
Do you not remember your safe word?

7
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.339
Hold on. I got it in your contract.

8
00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.108
What's your Wi-Fi password?

9
00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:35.476
- Sperm whale.

10
00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:36.310
Of course it is.

11
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:43.284
Nice try. Frank. but I'm
not doing mouth-to-mouth.

12
00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:45.820
- Screw it.

13
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.154
- You wish.

14
00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:49.857
- Mistress. can I have the lighter now?

15
00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:51.058
Please.

16
00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:52.326
- Freaking firebug.

17
00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:54.228
Are you out of your furry phase already?

18
00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:55.896
- Fire. yeah.

19
00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.264
Fire. fire.

20
00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:00.067
- It shuts up or it gets the duct tape.

21
00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:01.936
- Promises. promises.

22
00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:44.078
- Do you ever dress up like Barbie

23
00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:46.180
or a naughty Hogwarts student?

24
00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:47.848
- No.

25
00:01:47.848 --> 00:01:51.719
- It's gonna be so fun to share him.

26
00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.420
Sharing wasn't in the contract.

27
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.420
Well. this
should take care of that.

28
00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:03.397
- It wasn't in the contract.

29
00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:04.965
You signed the contract.

30
00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.600
- Bite me.

31
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.668
- Not in the contract.

32
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:09.370
What are you?

33
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.539
Some kind of union boss or something?

34
00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.140
Let's go.

35
00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:16.644
- Yeah. a union boss

36
00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:17.678
with a whip.

37
00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:23.117
- How much extra for hummer?

38
00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:26.353
- Somebody didn't read the contract.

39
00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.058
- Would you stop doing that?

40
00:02:31.058 --> 00:02:33.561
I mean. you think you
just get all of this dough

41
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:34.828
because you order me around

42
00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:36.630
and wear the cute little costume?

43
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.132
Come on. what are you. stupid?

44
00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:52.313
- Oh my God.

45
00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:53.647
Oh.

46
00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:04.592
Ow. goddamn. son of bitch.

47
00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:05.426
Ow

48
00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:11.198
- Mom!

49
00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:22.376
Once upon a time.
there was a dominatrix

50
00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:24.111
who wanted out.

51
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.081
But there's no safe word
for golden handcuffs.

52
00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:35.222
I hate that moniker. semi-colon.

53
00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:39.126
it makes me sound like
Godzilla. exclamation point.

54
00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:41.595
Shit.

55
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.100
My bid for freedom was
investing a half million

56
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.669
in my best friend Gabe's
real estate company.

57
00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.538
His business partner. Lloyd.
put it in a development deal

58
00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:55.075
in the boonies that would nab
us millions in six months.

59
00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:57.044
And I have this new boyfriend. Boris.

60
00:03:57.044 --> 00:03:59.580
I borrowed that investment money from.

61
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.182
He was the sweetest
acquaintance for 10 years.

62
00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:03.651
Then we went out.

63
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:06.220
Yeah. his boys. Vlad and
Viktor. more on them later.

64
00:04:24.338 --> 00:04:26.573
These clowns think I'll
actually have sex with them.

65
00:04:26.573 --> 00:04:29.043
I told you that buy one. get
one promo would backfire.

66
00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:32.212
- Guess who I'm going as to
the super BS Halloween party?

67
00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:33.213
- Oscar Wilde.

68
00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:35.749
- See. you are a genius.

69
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.017
- You've been Oscar Wilde every Halloween

70
00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:38.285
for the past decade.

71
00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:41.155
- But which Oscar Wilde
will I go as this year?

72
00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:42.056
- A gay one.

73
00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:43.524
How's Lloyd's deal going?

74
00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:46.427
- Someone's a little
antsy about her money.

75
00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:48.429
Is that Russian mafia
boss of yours finally

76
00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:50.164
putting the screws to you?

77
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:52.766
Oh. wait. that's right. he's gay.

78
00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:56.003
- Boris is not gay and he's not a mobster.

79
00:04:56.003 --> 00:04:57.171
Just because he's Russian and rich

80
00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:59.506
doesn't mean he goes around
breaking people's kneecaps.

81
00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:02.142
- And denial ain't just
a river in Egypt. honey.

82
00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:04.578
Let's not forget what happened

83
00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:06.046
to your buddy Professor Solomon.

84
00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:06.880
- Don't. Gabe.

85
00:05:08.248 --> 00:05:11.852
- Sooner you never see the
Godfather again. the better.

86
00:05:17.057 --> 00:05:18.192
- That's right. lemmings.

87
00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:21.595
I'm a goddess and I shit
rainbows and unicorns.

88
00:05:21.595 --> 00:05:23.731
God. it was a stupid. silly game.

89
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:26.567
And in six months. I'd
never have to play it again.

90
00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:30.170
I didn't wanna be here with
these IQ waving narcissists.

91
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.739
I wanted to be home in yoga pants.

92
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:34.308
bingeing on ice cream and BBC dramas.

93
00:05:37.778 --> 00:05:39.012
- Who is that?

94
00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.215
- Why?

95
00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:42.816
You wanna get your kink on?

96
00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:43.650
- Excuse me?

97
00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:45.753
- Go on.

98
00:05:45.753 --> 00:05:49.423
Ask her. ask her how
much you cost per hour.

99
00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:50.824
- You mean.

100
00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:51.925
- Yeah.

101
00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:54.294
- But with whips. and chains

102
00:05:54.294 --> 00:05:57.264
and all that kinky shit.

103
00:05:57.264 --> 00:05:59.800
Good money for spreading your legs.

104
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.671
- Test.

105
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.873
Testing.

106
00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:07.040
- No one cares. Karen.

107
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.342
They're here to drink.

108
00:06:08.342 --> 00:06:10.677
- Ladies and gentlemen. may I introduce

109
00:06:10.677 --> 00:06:14.581
our newest Super Brain Society
member. Jordan Gronendyke

110
00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:17.418
- Gronendyke

111
00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:19.253
Jordan Gronendyke.

112
00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:22.423
I'm 19 and the youngest masters
graduate from the state.

113
00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:24.091
4.0 GPA.

114
00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:28.595
- I have been the
youngest masters graduate

115
00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:29.530
in the state.

116
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.931
I thought I always would be.

117
00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:34.935
- And I was just accepted
into the Stanford PhD program.

118
00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:37.805
Can't go too soon though.
as I'm being honored

119
00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:39.206
at the White House in August.

120
00:06:43.544 --> 00:06:44.511
- I needed air.

121
00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.181
One new client and we could leave.

122
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.882
one new client and we could leave.

123
00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:52.052
- Looks like he just replaced
Ava as the new wunderkind.

124
00:06:52.052 --> 00:06:53.587
- Freaks pay her to spank them.

125
00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:54.688
Can you believe it?

126
00:06:54.688 --> 00:06:56.690
- Didn't she get expelled
from her PhD program?

127
00:06:57.524 --> 00:06:59.126
- Oh. how the mighty have fallen.

128
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.845
- And then I saw him.

129
00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:19.146
Fresh meat.

130
00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:23.317
Good evening.

131
00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:25.886
I'm Ava.

132
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.654
- Hi.

133
00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:31.291
- A little birdie told me
you needed some company.

134
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:32.125
- Excuse me.

135
00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:34.661
- It's an old expression.

136
00:07:37.865 --> 00:07:40.300
And what is your name?

137
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.602
- Radovan.

138
00:07:41.602 --> 00:07:42.903
- Where are you from. Radovan?

139
00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:43.737
- The Balkans.

140
00:07:43.737 --> 00:07:44.872
You know where that is?

141
00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:47.007
- Yes. I do.

142
00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:49.009
You are at an intellectually elitist party

143
00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.445
for IQs 140 and over. Mr. Radovan.

144
00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:56.316
This little birdie also mentioned
that there would be music

145
00:07:56.316 --> 00:07:58.485
and do you mind like
to join me for a dance.

146
00:07:58.485 --> 00:07:59.887
- Thank you. I'd rather not.

147
00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:04.091
- You see those people at
12 o'clock watching us?

148
00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:06.560
If I walk away right now. they'll think

149
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.961
you turned me down flat.

150
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:10.364
You wouldn't do that to me now. would you?

151
00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:12.299
- Perhaps you should not let the opinions

152
00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:14.334
of others dictate what you do.

153
00:08:16.737 --> 00:08:17.571
- Touche.

154
00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:22.943
Perhaps we could continue
this conversation?

155
00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:23.810
- Thank you.

156
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.214
I am sure it is a very expensive
card and I appreciate it.

157
00:08:28.348 --> 00:08:30.884
But I would hate for
you to waste it on me.

158
00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:31.919
Excuse me.

159
00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.793
- I got a special song

160
00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:41.562
for all of you love birds here tonight.

161
00:08:41.562 --> 00:08:44.665
Here's one for y'all called
"The Masterpiece of You."

162
00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:48.368
- Stick a fork in me.

163
00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:49.202
I'm done.

164
00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:52.272
- Oh. Mister Black-on-Charcoal

165
00:08:52.272 --> 00:08:54.374
didn't wanna play "Fifty
Shades" with you. hmm?

166
00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:57.644
- He eats from the other
side of the buffet.

167
00:08:57.644 --> 00:08:59.346
- Oh. he's not gay.

168
00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:00.714
Trust me.

169
00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:02.182
I did my worst.

170
00:09:02.182 --> 00:09:04.017
- You have the gay-dar of an armadillo.

171
00:09:04.017 --> 00:09:05.919
- I give great gay-dar.

172
00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:08.388
Besides. you're the one who
thought you had a chance

173
00:09:08.388 --> 00:09:10.123
with Nathan Mueller.

174
00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:11.458
- We were freshmen.

175
00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:13.160
He didn't even know he was gay.

176
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.127
For sure.

177
00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:16.496
- He drove a Beetle convertible

178
00:09:16.496 --> 00:09:17.497
and wore lipstick.

179
00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:18.365
- That was for a show.

180
00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:21.335
- And the fact that he was
a musical theater major

181
00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:22.469
didn't tip you off?

182
00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:24.104
- Shut up or I'll whip you for free.

183
00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:26.406
- Mr. Amador.

184
00:09:26.406 --> 00:09:27.641
- Father Radovan.

185
00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:29.242
Glad you're able to make it in.

186
00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:30.377
And how's the parish?

187
00:09:30.377 --> 00:09:32.012
- Gabe. you dick.

188
00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:34.481
- Very well.

189
00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:35.315
Thank you.

190
00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:37.684
I did not realize you
were in conversation.

191
00:09:37.684 --> 00:09:39.052
I'll just--
- Oh no. no. no. no.

192
00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:40.120
Please. please.

193
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.888
I believe you've met Miss Moriarty.

194
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.827
- Yes.

195
00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:48.862
- It's wonderful that you were
able to make it out tonight.

196
00:09:48.862 --> 00:09:51.531
So Lloyd's business deal
that you're so concerned

197
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:55.302
with is right by Father
Radovan's Episcopal parish.

198
00:09:55.302 --> 00:09:57.137
Beautiful church. Built

199
00:09:57.137 --> 00:09:58.305
by the firm that I believe you

200
00:09:58.305 --> 00:10:01.708
did your speech on in Kusper's class.

201
00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:02.542
Remember?

202
00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:04.845
- Burnham and Root or Lopez and Adams?

203
00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:06.380
- That one.

204
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.214
- Then it has to be

205
00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:09.149
the 1952 English Gothic
Revival Commission right

206
00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:10.050
before Lopez died.

207
00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:13.587
- It's a real treasure.

208
00:10:13.587 --> 00:10:15.122
Beautiful church.

209
00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:18.592
But it's also very expensive
to maintain and insure.

210
00:10:18.592 --> 00:10:20.360
So father Radovan was hoping

211
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.130
to borrow against the art collection.

212
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.298
- It was a suggestion made by Mr. Lloyd.

213
00:10:25.298 --> 00:10:27.467
His fiance. Ashley. is a parishioner.

214
00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:30.170
- Ashley Hicks?

215
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.638
The selfie reporter?

216
00:10:31.638 --> 00:10:33.206
- She runs our town's news site.

217
00:10:34.808 --> 00:10:37.377
Perhaps I spoke out of turn.
- Oh. not at all.

218
00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:39.413
We're both partners with him.

219
00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:42.482
We just didn't realize
that they were so serious.

220
00:10:42.482 --> 00:10:43.750
- You are both?

221
00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:47.888
- Yeah. Ava's our recent silent partner.

222
00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:49.289
But her day job is actually...
- I've been told

223
00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:51.091
what her day job is.

224
00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:53.160
- Oh. excellent.

225
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.228
Well. she's the art historian
that you were so eager

226
00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:56.863
for Lloyd to introduce you to.

227
00:10:56.863 --> 00:10:57.698
- Her?

228
00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:58.932
But she is a...

229
00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:01.168
she is a...

230
00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:02.736
- Excuse me.

231
00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.337
I'm not a pronoun.

232
00:11:04.337 --> 00:11:05.472
I'm standing right here.

233
00:11:05.472 --> 00:11:08.408
I'm not deaf and I speak
English better than most.

234
00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:09.710
Ava.

235
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.745
- I've dealt with this long enough. okay?

236
00:11:13.146 --> 00:11:15.716
What I do for a living doesn't
mean I don't have a brain.

237
00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:18.652
How I pay my utility bill
doesn't make me unworthy

238
00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:20.320
of basic human respect.

239
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.521
Just like what you do doesn't mean

240
00:11:21.521 --> 00:11:22.923
you're not a heartless boor.

241
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.829
- I apologize.

242
00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:30.363
I am sorry for my presumption.

243
00:11:30.363 --> 00:11:33.300
I did not intend to
insult or cause offense.

244
00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:35.602
You are correct.

245
00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:43.744
- I don't bite.

246
00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:45.712
Unless it's contracted.

247
00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:47.280
- We could not afford your services.

248
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.715
I am sure.

249
00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:50.817
As an art expert. I mean.

250
00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:52.052
I shouldn't have bothered you.

251
00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:52.886
Thank you.

252
00:11:54.121 --> 00:11:55.322
Excuse me.

253
00:11:55.322 --> 00:11:56.156
Good night.

254
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:59.426
- And here it comes.

255
00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:02.896
- What the Frankie Goes to
Hollywood's gotten into you?

256
00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:04.131
- I can't do this. Gabe. okay?

257
00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:05.398
Not tonight.

258
00:12:05.398 --> 00:12:06.233
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:07.067
I just.

260
00:12:09.703 --> 00:12:10.704
I'll call you. okay?

261
00:12:10.704 --> 00:12:13.240
Only six more months of public humiliation

262
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.375
before I could cash out and get out.

263
00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:17.811
Only six more months of tolerating Boris.

264
00:12:17.811 --> 00:12:20.614
Lloyd's promised return
couldn't come soon enough.

265
00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:24.518
Now he on ground!

266
00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:31.858
- Oh. Ava.

267
00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:32.826
We need to talk.

268
00:12:34.027 --> 00:12:35.762
- Do they have to be here?

269
00:12:35.762 --> 00:12:36.630
If this is about the toilet paper.

270
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.464
I'll turn it the other way.

271
00:12:37.464 --> 00:12:39.299
- This isn't working out between us.

272
00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:42.068
There is no win-win for me
to date you. just lose-lose.

273
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:45.472
- Okay.

274
00:12:47.307 --> 00:12:48.742
I--
- My construction business

275
00:12:48.742 --> 00:12:51.178
is growing into development.

276
00:12:51.178 --> 00:12:52.913
Very high profile.

277
00:12:52.913 --> 00:12:55.482
Many politicians and I rub shoulders now.

278
00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:57.150
I need to impress.

279
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.251
- Okay.

280
00:12:58.251 --> 00:13:00.353
- And I tried to be reasonable.

281
00:13:00.353 --> 00:13:02.289
but you are very selfish.

282
00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:04.624
You don't even want to have baby.

283
00:13:04.624 --> 00:13:06.893
Relationships supposed to be 50-50.

284
00:13:06.893 --> 00:13:09.863
Yet I give you money for a loan.

285
00:13:09.863 --> 00:13:11.531
you give me nothing in return.

286
00:13:13.433 --> 00:13:15.802
Dating dominatrix is not impressive.

287
00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:19.706
I could date a doctor or author.

288
00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.108
Person with brain. that would impress.

289
00:13:23.376 --> 00:13:26.646
- You think I'm stupid because
of what I do for a living?

290
00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:33.620
What did he say?

291
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.290
- PG version. he say you
are not only stupid idiot.

292
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.493
but you are a lazy. easy whore.

293
00:13:42.062 --> 00:13:43.330
- Oh. wow.

294
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.898
I guess that means even easy whores

295
00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:46.833
won't give you a second look.

296
00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:48.001
This is about Vlad.

297
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:50.237
Vlad wants you to date
his sister. doesn't he?

298
00:13:50.237 --> 00:13:51.838
That bottle blonde.

299
00:13:51.838 --> 00:13:53.039
- Enough talking.

300
00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:54.841
Get your things. get out. we're done.

301
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:58.578
- This is really rich.
considering it was your party.

302
00:13:58.578 --> 00:13:59.946
your asshole guest

303
00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:02.249
and the three of you were the only reason

304
00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:05.218
I became a dominatrix to begin with.

305
00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:07.254
Did you post that video of me too?

306
00:14:07.254 --> 00:14:09.089
I wouldn't be surprised.

307
00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:11.825
- Why you think I give you massive loan?

308
00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:12.926
Because I am nice?

309
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:16.329
'Cause I want to sleep with you?

310
00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:19.766
It was supposed to be soft
landing out of what you're doing.

311
00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:23.370
No mother of my child be sex worker.

312
00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:25.538
Don't want to be mother?

313
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.108
Give me my money back.

314
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:33.280
- You'll get it.

315
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.116
In six months when Gabe
and Lloyd's deal clears.

316
00:14:36.116 --> 00:14:37.751
as we agreed.

317
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.388
- I loaned you $500.000.

318
00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:47.861
720.000 and 82 cents.

319
00:14:50.964 --> 00:14:53.366
Payment due within 30 days.

320
00:14:53.366 --> 00:14:54.801
- That wasn't our contract.

321
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:58.071
- Contract has changed.

322
00:15:00.707 --> 00:15:02.809
- That money was my entire future.

323
00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:03.777
My escape.

324
00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:09.516
You'll get your damn 720.

325
00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:11.918
- And 82--
- And 82 cents.

326
00:15:14.454 --> 00:15:17.324
- And I'm not taking you
to Realtor gala this year.

327
00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:19.859
- I bought my own ticket. asshole.

328
00:15:23.263 --> 00:15:25.999
Lloyd. why aren't you picking up?

329
00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:28.001
Call me back. okay?

330
00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:29.069
I need my money.

331
00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:52.192
- Majko

332
00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:06.006
- For your nurse and the insurance. mama.

333
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.146
- Practice your English. majko.

334
00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:19.119
- In case anything happens to me.

335
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:27.227
- I

336
00:16:27.227 --> 00:16:28.795
forbid

337
00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:30.030
you.

338
00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:33.900
- For 20 years you're the only one

339
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.036
I can speak our language with.

340
00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:38.471
- I'm the only one you
talk to besides the doctor.

341
00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:39.506
- And the TV.

342
00:16:39.506 --> 00:16:41.574
- Yelling at the news doesn't count.

343
00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:48.882
What did the doctor say?

344
00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:51.518
- The cancer spread.

345
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.562
- What we do now?

346
00:17:04.597 --> 00:17:07.100
Whatever you need. mama.
I'll make it happen.

347
00:17:12.872 --> 00:17:14.074
- What were you humming?

348
00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:16.876
- Oh. an old love song.

349
00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:21.081
My majko sang it to me when I was a girl.

350
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:21.915
My favorite.

351
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.419
We used to have such music in our family.

352
00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:31.357
- We used to have a bigger family.

353
00:17:31.357 --> 00:17:34.160
- I miss your voice. Radko.

354
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.262
I wish you would sing
again .

355
00:17:37.964 --> 00:17:39.532
- I wish I could. mama.

356
00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:48.575
Was baka an artist like your uncle?

357
00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:52.812
- No. but she loved music.

358
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.117
She always wanted to
see the orchestra again.

359
00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:57.951
but

360
00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:00.954
then the war came and...

361
00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.925
Don't let that happen to me. Radko.

362
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:10.196
Take us back to Serbia.

363
00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:11.364
Let's go back home.

364
00:18:59.445 --> 00:19:01.447
Read aloud mode enabled.

365
00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:05.018
Nice spread. Ava.

366
00:19:05.018 --> 00:19:07.954
Never thought I'd get to say that. LOL.

367
00:19:11.424 --> 00:19:14.794
- Come on. come on.

368
00:19:14.794 --> 00:19:16.429
- Early this morning. Lloyd Bartman

369
00:19:16.429 --> 00:19:18.665
was found dead here in his townhome.

370
00:19:19.532 --> 00:19:22.235
Authorities are investigating
it as a suicide.

371
00:19:22.235 --> 00:19:24.137
but I was the one who found him.

372
00:19:24.137 --> 00:19:26.573
And I want you to know the truth.

373
00:19:26.573 --> 00:19:28.508
It was an accident.

374
00:19:28.508 --> 00:19:30.610
He wasn't suicidal.

375
00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.212
He was the love of my life.

376
00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:35.782
He died because of one person.

377
00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:38.851
a greedy self-serving pervert
who is tempting your husbands

378
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:41.387
and boyfriends into
doing this to themselves.

379
00:19:41.387 --> 00:19:43.556
- I told him autoerotic asphyxiation

380
00:19:43.556 --> 00:19:45.391
was adult supervision only.

381
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:48.728
- Ava Moriarty. this is personal.

382
00:19:48.728 --> 00:19:50.496
You took my Lloyd.

383
00:19:50.496 --> 00:19:53.299
I'm tearing down your empire of masochism.

384
00:19:53.299 --> 00:19:54.867
- Not a bad domain name.

385
00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:56.269
Empire of Masochism.
- I just published

386
00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:57.670
your client list. Ava.

387
00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.938
Your history.

388
00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:00.273
- Oh. no. oh. no.

389
00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:03.142
I needed my client base
until Lloyd's deal closed.

390
00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:05.745
This is Gay Lord.

391
00:20:05.745 --> 00:20:07.313
My wife just figured out

392
00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:08.982
you are not a random biker chick.

393
00:20:10.216 --> 00:20:11.784
Or the dogwalker.

394
00:20:12.752 --> 00:20:14.387
Do you have a couch?

395
00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:17.657
This is Gay Lord's wife.

396
00:20:17.657 --> 00:20:20.526
You should be ashamed of
your horrible tramp self.

397
00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:22.262
Burn in hell.

398
00:20:23.329 --> 00:20:26.266
- Mrs. Evans. comma. I never had sex

399
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:29.869
with your husband. period.
or any of my clients. period.

400
00:20:29.869 --> 00:20:31.971
My services are--

401
00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:34.207
You are a
homewrecker and you have the boobs

402
00:20:34.207 --> 00:20:35.341
of an eighth grader.

403
00:20:38.411 --> 00:20:39.812
- Congrats. period.

404
00:20:39.812 --> 00:20:43.816
I hear you play World Cup Soccer
with yours. exclamation point.

405
00:20:47.387 --> 00:20:48.454
- What's in the bank?

406
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:51.924
What are your liquid assets?

407
00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:53.760
- I put everything into buying a third

408
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.295
of your company. remember?

409
00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.630
Because of Lloyd's
mysterious development deal?

410
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.968
- I just printed this out.

411
00:21:06.005 --> 00:21:07.774
- They're empty accounts.

412
00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:11.377
- Those are our company assets.

413
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.814
- What do you mean?

414
00:21:15.948 --> 00:21:17.984
What happened to my money?

415
00:21:17.984 --> 00:21:20.186
- Well. I called the bank

416
00:21:20.186 --> 00:21:22.221
and apparently Lloyd

417
00:21:23.122 --> 00:21:26.726
took everything out two weeks ago.

418
00:21:29.095 --> 00:21:30.496
They have no idea where it is.

419
00:21:38.204 --> 00:21:40.106
- When's the memorial?

420
00:21:40.106 --> 00:21:42.709
- Tomorrow in Justamere.

421
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.945
- Father Dracula's podunk town?

422
00:21:52.585 --> 00:21:54.987
- I wonder if he'll drown
us in Lake Michigan.

423
00:21:55.922 --> 00:21:59.125
or if he'll break our
kneecaps first. then drown us.

424
00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:00.660
- We're dying together now. are we?

425
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.728
How romantic.

426
00:22:01.728 --> 00:22:02.628
- Isn't it?

427
00:22:02.628 --> 00:22:06.399
Although if we're dying
together. and I'm being honest.

428
00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:08.768
I would much prefer if
your name was Raphael

429
00:22:08.768 --> 00:22:11.137
and you're 6'4 with an eight pack.

430
00:22:11.137 --> 00:22:12.205
- Funny that.

431
00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.906
I would much rather you be named Raphael

432
00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:15.808
and be 6'4 with an eight pack too.

433
00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:17.243
- I'm sure Boris would agree.

434
00:22:18.544 --> 00:22:20.580
- Erectile dysfunction has a number

435
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.181
of medical causes and reasons.

436
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:23.549
- His erectile didn't function

437
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:26.753
with you because he's gay.

438
00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:37.330
Focus.

439
00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:40.032
This is the part where I say.

440
00:22:40.032 --> 00:22:42.535
"Oh. doesn't he look like himself?"

441
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.773
- He looks like a roided up salt shaker.

442
00:22:46.773 --> 00:22:49.776
Shh!

443
00:22:49.776 --> 00:22:52.512
- Make me into a diamond
when I'm dead. okay?

444
00:22:52.512 --> 00:22:54.847
- Oh. honey. you know
I don't wear diamonds.

445
00:22:54.847 --> 00:22:55.848
- I heard it's blue.

446
00:22:56.716 --> 00:22:57.950
- Okay. maybe then.

447
00:22:59.452 --> 00:23:01.454
Lloyd should have opted to be a diamond.

448
00:23:02.722 --> 00:23:03.556
I'd wear him.

449
00:23:04.524 --> 00:23:05.358
Right

450
00:23:05.358 --> 00:23:06.225
here.

451
00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:11.898
Then in death. he finally
would have realized

452
00:23:11.898 --> 00:23:13.466
his lifelong dream.

453
00:23:15.968 --> 00:23:18.371
Poor Lloyd always wanted to be a stud.

454
00:23:24.977 --> 00:23:27.313
- Miss Moriarty. may I have a word?

455
00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:30.983
I'm Mayor Kupsik.

456
00:23:30.983 --> 00:23:32.752
Perhaps we can speak in the back.

457
00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:42.195
I need to contract your
services. Miss Moriarty.

458
00:23:42.195 --> 00:23:43.896
Not for myself. mind you.

459
00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:46.566
I don't need any misconduct accusations

460
00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:47.400
with the election.

461
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.302
- You got a friend?

462
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.369
- Not exactly.

463
00:23:50.369 --> 00:23:51.804
Have you met Father Markovic?

464
00:23:53.406 --> 00:23:55.608
- Not the highlight of my year.

465
00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:58.478
- I will hire you to get photos

466
00:23:58.478 --> 00:24:01.380
of you two in a compromising
position. preferably

467
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.616
with some of the appliances

468
00:24:03.616 --> 00:24:06.652
that you use to do what you do.

469
00:24:08.387 --> 00:24:10.022
- Let me explain what it means

470
00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:13.826
to be an honest. self-respecting
person. Mr. Mayor.

471
00:24:13.826 --> 00:24:16.762
I'm not a whore and I'm
not an extortionist.

472
00:24:16.762 --> 00:24:17.597
- Come on.

473
00:24:17.597 --> 00:24:18.664
He's Episcopal.

474
00:24:18.664 --> 00:24:20.600
They're allowed to make whoopee.

475
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:23.970
Wait.

476
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.937
- Make it good.

477
00:24:26.172 --> 00:24:27.073
- Name your price.

478
00:24:28.007 --> 00:24:30.276
I'm willing to pay big.

479
00:24:30.276 --> 00:24:31.110
Just...

480
00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:34.447
I'll give you some time to think about it.

481
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:40.019
- This is perfect.

482
00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:41.420
- It's bullshit.

483
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.790
Unlike Lloyd. I have a little
something called a moral code.

484
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.926
which is why I never got
the internship I wanted

485
00:24:46.926 --> 00:24:47.860
If you recall.

486
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.229
- Moral codes are for when
it isn't life or death

487
00:24:50.229 --> 00:24:51.697
in 28 days.

488
00:24:51.697 --> 00:24:52.765
- Gabe--
- No.

489
00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:54.467
do you not think Boris is serious?

490
00:24:55.835 --> 00:24:57.937
What about his associates
Beavis and Butthead?

491
00:24:57.937 --> 00:25:00.373
Do you think they were hired
for their ironing prowess?

492
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:01.207
Come on.

493
00:25:01.207 --> 00:25:03.543
- I'm not a prostitute.

494
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:05.177
I'm not a bad person.

495
00:25:05.177 --> 00:25:06.112
No one is saying

496
00:25:06.112 --> 00:25:08.714
you have to sleep with Dracula.

497
00:25:08.714 --> 00:25:10.716
Get him drunk. get some photos.

498
00:25:10.716 --> 00:25:12.218
done.

499
00:25:12.218 --> 00:25:13.419
- Like I could get that close.

500
00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:15.221
The man hates me.

501
00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:17.757
- Okay. what's your grand plan?

502
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.430
- Fine. I'll stay in
town a while. blend in.

503
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.298
get the lay of the land and figure out

504
00:25:25.298 --> 00:25:27.533
what this scheme is all about.

505
00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:29.402
- You?

506
00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:33.339
Much better plan.

507
00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:02.435
- Holy hell.

508
00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:03.269
Gabe was right.

509
00:26:32.865 --> 00:26:35.034
Who the hell was at the
church at this hour?

510
00:26:36.869 --> 00:26:38.204
You left me
standing there with my dick

511
00:26:38.204 --> 00:26:39.038
in my hands.

512
00:26:39.038 --> 00:26:41.874
- Oh. I thought that
was it's favorite place.

513
00:26:41.874 --> 00:26:42.908
Real nice. smart ass.

514
00:26:42.908 --> 00:26:44.944
You know that guy I wanted you to meet?

515
00:26:44.944 --> 00:26:46.178
Boris Vasiliev?

516
00:26:48.848 --> 00:26:50.783
- Boris Vasiliev. the Russian?

517
00:26:50.783 --> 00:26:54.220
- No. Boris Vasiliev the Nigerian prince.

518
00:26:56.422 --> 00:26:57.623
- You never mentioned Boris Vasiliev.

519
00:26:57.623 --> 00:27:00.126
He's got big
money riding on the 30th

520
00:27:00.126 --> 00:27:02.194
and he wants to purpose
a business arrangement.

521
00:27:02.194 --> 00:27:03.796
He wasn't a happy camper when you ghosted

522
00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:04.630
before he could meet you--

523
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.565
- I didn't agree to meet him. Walter

524
00:27:06.565 --> 00:27:08.034
and I'm not going to.

525
00:27:09.035 --> 00:27:11.270
I don't make money for anyone but myself.

526
00:27:17.209 --> 00:27:19.245
- Uh. yeah. I always
came back from the gym

527
00:27:19.245 --> 00:27:21.280
with enough cash for a Cadillac.

528
00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:44.170
- Miss Moriarty. what are you doing here?

529
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.438
- Forget first impressions.

530
00:27:45.438 --> 00:27:47.206
Third time's the real charm.

531
00:27:54.213 --> 00:27:55.614
I was out for a walk

532
00:27:55.614 --> 00:27:57.616
and I.

533
00:27:57.616 --> 00:28:01.220
I thought I saw an owl in the yard.

534
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.054
I thought.

535
00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:09.128
I could have hurt you.

536
00:28:09.128 --> 00:28:11.931
If you must walk alone at night.

537
00:28:11.931 --> 00:28:14.333
you should take a class.

538
00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:16.001
Self-defense.

539
00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:17.069
- Yes. you're right.

540
00:28:17.069 --> 00:28:18.270
Sorry.

541
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.406
- You know. you should
consider some tuck-pointing.

542
00:28:20.406 --> 00:28:21.907
Just saying.

543
00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:26.746
- Miss Moriarty. are you all right?

544
00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:28.380
- I'm good. all fine.

545
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.182
God. let there be ice in my freezer.

546
00:28:50.069 --> 00:28:50.903
Why don't you tell me the reason

547
00:28:50.903 --> 00:28:54.006
you want Radovan Markovic
humiliated and discredited.

548
00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:55.474
- Look. Miss Moriarty.

549
00:28:55.474 --> 00:28:58.110
This is why I told you to name your price.

550
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.612
I don't have time to tap dance

551
00:28:59.612 --> 00:29:01.580
to this Sherlock Holmes routine.

552
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.783
My offer stands.

553
00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:05.284
Now. I'm a very busy man.

554
00:29:05.284 --> 00:29:06.986
Are you gonna get the pictures or not?

555
00:29:06.986 --> 00:29:09.855
If not. we're done here.

556
00:29:10.823 --> 00:29:13.359
- I'll consider meeting your conditions.

557
00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:14.860
but you'll meet my price.

558
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:16.862
- And what's that?

559
00:29:25.704 --> 00:29:28.507
- And 82 cents?

560
00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:31.377
- I'll let you think on it.

561
00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:40.352
Before accepting any business proposal.

562
00:29:40.352 --> 00:29:43.455
due diligence requires a
certain amount of research.

563
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:50.462
And if you can't make allies.
you buy them with chocolate.

564
00:29:50.462 --> 00:29:52.865
- My family has been going
to St. Michael's for years.

565
00:29:52.865 --> 00:29:54.400
Ever since Father Dave.

566
00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:57.169
He's long gone now. bless his soul.

567
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:58.971
- So when did Father Radovan arrive?

568
00:30:00.472 --> 00:30:02.641
- 20 years ago maybe?

569
00:30:02.641 --> 00:30:05.177
He was assistant pastor under Father Dave.

570
00:30:05.177 --> 00:30:07.246
He went to seminary right outside town.

571
00:30:07.246 --> 00:30:09.915
- You know. I saw the parking
lot on Sunday morning.

572
00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:11.317
Congregation seems pretty small

573
00:30:11.317 --> 00:30:13.652
to financially support the property.

574
00:30:13.652 --> 00:30:16.021
- Look I'm on the board even I don't know

575
00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:18.157
how Father keeps the lights on.

576
00:30:18.157 --> 00:30:20.392
We need all the help we can get.

577
00:30:24.196 --> 00:30:29.034
- So why don't you invite
Father Dracula to the gala

578
00:30:29.034 --> 00:30:30.502
since you don't have a date anymore.

579
00:30:30.502 --> 00:30:31.804
- You know about the gala?

580
00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:34.707
- Lloyd and I were one of the sponsors.

581
00:30:39.979 --> 00:30:40.913
- Where you going?

582
00:30:40.913 --> 00:30:42.047
- Hot date in the city.

583
00:30:42.982 --> 00:30:43.816
Don't wait up.

584
00:31:09.475 --> 00:31:10.809
- Stop calling me that.

585
00:31:14.213 --> 00:31:15.881
I'm trying to survive Isaiah.

586
00:31:21.654 --> 00:31:22.488
Too late.

587
00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:44.209
- Hey there. anything you
see you want. take it.

588
00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:15.607
- Why the hell were
Tweedledee and Tweedledum here?

589
00:32:15.607 --> 00:32:16.775
Had they followed me?

590
00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:25.117
- A need for tuckpointing has
been brought to my attention.

591
00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:26.652
Anyone comfortable doing that?

592
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:30.589
Kurt. you handle that.

593
00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:31.423
All right.

594
00:32:31.423 --> 00:32:34.727
Anyone have experience
with stone mosaic repair?

595
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:36.829
Anybody?

596
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:37.663
All right.

597
00:32:37.663 --> 00:32:40.833
How about stone restoration
for St. Michael statue?

598
00:32:42.735 --> 00:32:46.405
Deb. why don't you handle
the stained glass cleaning?

599
00:32:46.405 --> 00:32:47.773
The ammonia is in the cellar.

600
00:32:47.773 --> 00:32:50.142
- Only if you wanna destroy the paint.

601
00:32:50.142 --> 00:32:51.343
- Deb. the vinegar.

602
00:32:51.343 --> 00:32:52.978
- No ammonia. no vinegar.

603
00:32:52.978 --> 00:32:55.514
You need neutral pH soap
and lint free cloths.

604
00:32:57.182 --> 00:33:00.019
- What is your previous
experience. Miss Moriarty?

605
00:33:00.986 --> 00:33:01.987
- Oh. you know.

606
00:33:01.987 --> 00:33:04.923
Restoring the largest Gothic
Rose window in North America.

607
00:33:04.923 --> 00:33:06.258
Are the cames oxidized?

608
00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:09.228
- The what?

609
00:33:09.228 --> 00:33:11.263
- The black parts that
hold the glass together.

610
00:33:11.263 --> 00:33:12.097
They're lead.

611
00:33:12.097 --> 00:33:14.400
You scrub that. that's
what you'll be inhaling.

612
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.337
- It's all yours.

613
00:33:23.308 --> 00:33:24.276
- Deb?

614
00:33:25.144 --> 00:33:26.378
Kurt?

615
00:34:04.783 --> 00:34:05.617
Hello.

616
00:34:10.055 --> 00:34:11.256
Well. that wasn't him.

617
00:34:11.256 --> 00:34:13.826
And the birthdate was too
young to be dear old dad.

618
00:34:20.766 --> 00:34:22.901
Whatever he was hiding.
I was going to find it.

619
00:34:22.901 --> 00:34:24.803
And I wasn't going to get caught aga--

620
00:34:26.438 --> 00:34:27.606
Serious respect.

621
00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:30.275
He took resting dick face
to a whole new level.

622
00:34:30.275 --> 00:34:31.443
- May I help you?

623
00:34:33.045 --> 00:34:38.045
- I was looking for the bathroom
when I saw all your books.

624
00:34:38.217 --> 00:34:39.384
I'd love to learn more about the church.

625
00:34:39.384 --> 00:34:40.385
I imagine you're busy right now.

626
00:34:40.385 --> 00:34:42.888
but perhaps some time we could talk.

627
00:34:47.726 --> 00:34:50.496
- This is a little dry. but it is at least

628
00:34:50.496 --> 00:34:52.431
what is word. concise.

629
00:34:53.298 --> 00:34:54.133
- Oh.

630
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:55.934
thanks.

631
00:34:57.769 --> 00:34:59.438
I've been wondering

632
00:34:59.438 --> 00:35:03.742
aren't most Christian Serbians
Orthodox. not Episcopal?

633
00:35:03.742 --> 00:35:04.576
- Yes.

634
00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:10.916
- The bathroom is down
the hall to the left.

635
00:35:18.657 --> 00:35:20.425
- Any new discoveries?

636
00:35:20.425 --> 00:35:21.326
Maybe.

637
00:35:21.326 --> 00:35:22.794
The guy who finally finished construction

638
00:35:22.794 --> 00:35:23.629
on the church

639
00:35:23.629 --> 00:35:26.765
was one of the town's big
wigs. Joseph Oberstein.

640
00:35:26.765 --> 00:35:28.367
- Joseph Oberstein?

641
00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:29.735
The gay guy?

642
00:35:29.735 --> 00:35:30.903
- What?

643
00:35:30.903 --> 00:35:34.306
- Yeah. he was an art
collector around World War II.

644
00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:36.241
Fled the Nazis with his art collection.

645
00:35:37.142 --> 00:35:39.178
He was closeted. but still very well known

646
00:35:39.178 --> 00:35:40.012
in my community.

647
00:35:41.113 --> 00:35:43.482
- Well. Oberstein died in 1955

648
00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:45.517
and the church building
sold to an immigrant

649
00:35:45.517 --> 00:35:48.420
from Yugoslavia named Oto Ekres.

650
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.454
Upon Oto's death.

651
00:35:49.454 --> 00:35:53.559
it went into a trust named
Justamere Trust. of course.

652
00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:56.195
And I can't seem to
find the current owner.

653
00:35:57.329 --> 00:36:00.465
So what happened to
Oberstein's art after he died?

654
00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:47.079
- Oberstein had over a hundred paintings

655
00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:50.249
with a particular interest
in Baroque masters.

656
00:36:51.817 --> 00:36:55.020
Mardee. do you have any idea
what happened to his paintings?

657
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.256
- Now that's the million dollar question.

658
00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:58.924
Literally.

659
00:36:58.924 --> 00:37:01.159
All his files were lost in the fire.

660
00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:03.729
Summer 1956.

661
00:37:03.729 --> 00:37:06.732
Fire might've gotten
some of the paintings.

662
00:37:06.732 --> 00:37:09.668
Hard to say as that's before
they auctioned off his estate.

663
00:37:10.702 --> 00:37:13.438
- Do you think I can get a
copy of the auction program?

664
00:37:15.173 --> 00:37:16.275
- Let me call my aunt.

665
00:37:28.654 --> 00:37:30.689
- What are you hoping to find?

666
00:37:30.689 --> 00:37:31.757
- I don't know.

667
00:37:32.824 --> 00:37:35.127
Hopefully something that
links the mayor to the church

668
00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:37.362
and explains his motivation for extortion.

669
00:37:37.362 --> 00:37:39.898
Or Radovan's gym bag of cash.

670
00:37:45.237 --> 00:37:49.508
- Word on the street is that
Lloyd got her savings too.

671
00:37:55.314 --> 00:37:56.481
- One for her.

672
00:37:57.416 --> 00:37:59.551
- Oh. how magnanimous of you.

673
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:00.752
- Don't polish my halo.

674
00:38:00.752 --> 00:38:03.522
They're on special.

675
00:38:03.522 --> 00:38:06.625
- I'd let you polish
way more than my halo.

676
00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:07.726
Hubert's the name.

677
00:38:07.726 --> 00:38:09.294
Welcome to the joint.

678
00:38:09.294 --> 00:38:10.996
How you doing. little lady?

679
00:38:10.996 --> 00:38:13.699
- And here comes the creepy pickup line.

680
00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:15.167
- Wait. I know you.

681
00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:17.336
Ava Moriarty.

682
00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:19.338
I might be interested in your

683
00:38:20.539 --> 00:38:22.307
services.

684
00:38:22.307 --> 00:38:23.141
- Wait for it.

685
00:38:23.141 --> 00:38:24.476
wait for it.

686
00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:26.645
Do you charge more for super-sized?

687
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.715
I got truck balls that are modeled

688
00:38:29.715 --> 00:38:30.782
after real life. you know.

689
00:38:30.782 --> 00:38:32.551
- If I had a dime.

690
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:35.487
My insurance prohibits
overweight health risks.

691
00:38:35.487 --> 00:38:37.456
Thank you for your interest. goodnight.

692
00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:47.566
- Hi. Ava.

693
00:38:49.067 --> 00:38:51.370
I'm Deb. we met at the church cleaning.

694
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.004
- Yes I remember.
- Yeah.

695
00:38:53.004 --> 00:38:57.442
- So. Kurt and I. we are
getting married in a few weeks.

696
00:38:57.442 --> 00:38:58.577
- Oh. congrats.

697
00:38:58.577 --> 00:39:00.545
- Yes. so that's why I
wanted to talk to you

698
00:39:00.545 --> 00:39:04.883
because he is having a
bachelor party next weekend.

699
00:39:04.883 --> 00:39:07.386
I know you don't know that. probably.

700
00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:10.889
but please hear me out.

701
00:39:44.189 --> 00:39:45.023
- Hubert.

702
00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:49.227
How have you been?

703
00:39:49.227 --> 00:39:50.762
- Hey Father.

704
00:39:51.663 --> 00:39:54.499
- I don't believe the lady
asked for your escort home.

705
00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:57.569
- Why don't you mind your own business?

706
00:39:57.569 --> 00:40:00.238
- You assaulting a woman
when I could have prevented

707
00:40:00.238 --> 00:40:01.807
it is my business.

708
00:40:01.807 --> 00:40:04.309
- Hey. keep your Hungarian mouth shut.

709
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:06.211
Otherwise I'm gonna go tell everybody

710
00:40:06.211 --> 00:40:09.781
about how you and Father
Dave were so chummy.

711
00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:10.982
If you know what I mean.

712
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.295
- Hi. Chief.

713
00:40:24.563 --> 00:40:27.299
Hubert passed out behind bar again.

714
00:40:28.834 --> 00:40:29.768
No. I'll stay.

715
00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:50.121
if I found gym bags full
of ill gotten gains.

716
00:40:50.121 --> 00:40:51.189
I wouldn't have to woo him

717
00:40:51.189 --> 00:40:53.892
with my new found knowledge of Jeremiah.

718
00:40:53.892 --> 00:40:56.561
God. that dude needed Prozac.

719
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.744
I knew it immediately.

720
00:41:12.744 --> 00:41:14.246
It was a Merisi.

721
00:41:14.246 --> 00:41:16.214
A Merisi no one had seen.

722
00:41:16.214 --> 00:41:18.383
Judith and Holofernes. the holy grail

723
00:41:18.383 --> 00:41:20.619
of Baroque scholars around the world.

724
00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:22.020
It was magnificent.

725
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.922
As breathtaking as his Taking of Christ.

726
00:41:23.922 --> 00:41:26.091
as stunning as his Seven Works of Mercy.

727
00:41:35.934 --> 00:41:37.302
He has a Merisi.

728
00:41:40.338 --> 00:41:42.974
It should be at the National Gallery.

729
00:41:42.974 --> 00:41:44.175
At the Vatican. even.

730
00:41:46.177 --> 00:41:49.648
- How did a piece of art that
old make to to Justamere?

731
00:41:49.648 --> 00:41:50.615
- Oberstein.

732
00:41:51.483 --> 00:41:53.919
Art dealer fleeing the Nazis. remember?

733
00:41:53.919 --> 00:41:56.021
A bunch of his art went
missing when he died.

734
00:41:56.021 --> 00:41:58.123
I'm betting it wound up in the church.

735
00:41:58.123 --> 00:42:01.159
Radovan hid the painting
because he knows what it's worth

736
00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:03.695
and he would make millions if he sold it.

737
00:42:04.629 --> 00:42:06.998
I bet he's already been
selling Oberstein's paintings

738
00:42:06.998 --> 00:42:08.333
on the black market.

739
00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:11.403
And that's where that
sack of cash came from.

740
00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:13.505
And that's why he wanted an art appraisal.

741
00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:15.740
- Son of a bitch.

742
00:42:16.875 --> 00:42:18.944
- The mayor met my price.

743
00:42:20.679 --> 00:42:22.247
I'm gonna bring Dracula down.

744
00:42:24.282 --> 00:42:25.684
- He was at the bar tonight.

745
00:42:28.687 --> 00:42:32.190
- I heard them run out
when I called for you.

746
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.392
Maybe it was a dream.
maybe it was a warning.

747
00:42:34.392 --> 00:42:36.328
- Then maybe you should
lock the doors like

748
00:42:36.328 --> 00:42:37.429
I tell you to. huh?

749
00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:39.030
What do you want me to do. huh?

750
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.098
- The painting.

751
00:42:40.098 --> 00:42:41.666
Take it from here.

752
00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:44.903
Keep it safe in your church
where no one can find it.

753
00:42:46.538 --> 00:42:47.772
- Uncle Oto's painting?

754
00:42:47.772 --> 00:42:49.574
Why would anyone want to steal that?

755
00:42:51.643 --> 00:42:53.044
Okay. if it makes you happy.

756
00:42:53.044 --> 00:42:56.681
But I'm flushing these.

757
00:42:56.681 --> 00:42:58.316
- It will be yours when I die.

758
00:42:58.316 --> 00:42:59.985
Then you will understand.

759
00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:01.152
- Can't wait.

760
00:43:04.422 --> 00:43:05.657
I need to go.

761
00:43:05.657 --> 00:43:07.926
- Go. have fun. get laid.

762
00:43:07.926 --> 00:43:09.160
- Majko.

763
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.363
- It's good for heart.

764
00:43:11.363 --> 00:43:13.498
Besides. you're not getting any younger.

765
00:43:13.498 --> 00:43:14.833
It's good stress reliever.

766
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:15.667
- Majko.

767
00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:18.937
- Bring me home good girl.

768
00:43:18.937 --> 00:43:20.171
One who makes you happy.

769
00:43:21.006 --> 00:43:22.474
Someone you can take care of.

770
00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:24.376
You need someone to nag when I'm gone.

771
00:43:25.777 --> 00:43:27.445
- Don't talk about being gone.

772
00:43:30.682 --> 00:43:31.883
You'll be here forever.

773
00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:34.653
- I wish I could be.

774
00:43:34.653 --> 00:43:37.956
but do you know your father
and your brother wait for me.

775
00:43:39.624 --> 00:43:41.793
It's you I worry about. Radko.

776
00:43:42.961 --> 00:43:44.462
You've been alone too long.

777
00:43:44.462 --> 00:43:46.598
It's not good for men to be alone.

778
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.308
- You missed a spot.

779
00:45:04.476 --> 00:45:06.177
- Text Gabe.

780
00:45:06.177 --> 00:45:08.947
I need you tomorrow night. semi-colon.

781
00:45:08.947 --> 00:45:10.782
Bring your camera. period.

782
00:45:16.554 --> 00:45:18.990
The two monochromatic ones
on the end are contemporary.

783
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.425
No more than 60 years old.

784
00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:22.894
- How do you know?

785
00:45:22.894 --> 00:45:23.928
- They're acrylic.

786
00:45:23.928 --> 00:45:25.764
The first usable acrylic resin dispersion

787
00:45:25.764 --> 00:45:27.365
wasn't developed until 1934.

788
00:45:27.365 --> 00:45:30.235
And didn't become commercially
available until the 1950s.

789
00:45:31.169 --> 00:45:32.670
This one's a steel engraving.

790
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.106
1880s I'd guess. probably
from a German book.

791
00:45:35.106 --> 00:45:36.808
Get about 15 bucks for it on eBay.

792
00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:42.013
This is a print I
recognize from the 1930s.

793
00:45:42.013 --> 00:45:44.516
This one's a giclee. so post-1991.

794
00:45:44.516 --> 00:45:46.718
You'd get more for the frame.

795
00:45:46.718 --> 00:45:49.788
This one. late pre-Rafaelite.

796
00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:52.457
likely turn-of-the-century
lithographic reproduction.

797
00:45:52.457 --> 00:45:54.559
Unusual insofar as that school

798
00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.395
rarely painted Biblical scenes.
Hunt being the exception.

799
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.132
- I believe I understood half of that.

800
00:46:02.033 --> 00:46:04.969
- And you have no idea of the
provenance of any of them?

801
00:46:04.969 --> 00:46:05.904
- The what?

802
00:46:05.904 --> 00:46:08.740
- How. when. why they came to be here.

803
00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:11.042
Uh-huh.

804
00:46:12.677 --> 00:46:15.880
Well. I can make recommendations
for a second opinion.

805
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.649
but I would say they're probably worth

806
00:46:17.649 --> 00:46:19.717
more as part of the church's history.

807
00:46:19.717 --> 00:46:20.718
- Thank you.

808
00:46:21.686 --> 00:46:23.621
You are a true genius. you know.

809
00:46:23.621 --> 00:46:25.123
That was brilliant.

810
00:46:25.123 --> 00:46:26.691
- You're easily impressed. Father.

811
00:46:26.691 --> 00:46:28.793
Don't brush me off.

812
00:46:28.793 --> 00:46:31.329
You have a gift.

813
00:46:31.329 --> 00:46:34.332
Why don't you do this more?

814
00:46:34.332 --> 00:46:36.367
Do this for a living.

815
00:46:36.367 --> 00:46:38.570
- You think doing this
paid for grad school?

816
00:46:40.038 --> 00:46:42.240
There're things you do for love. Father.

817
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.375
And there are things
to do for your SEP IRA.

818
00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:47.545
Or because your best
was just never enough.

819
00:46:47.545 --> 00:46:50.114
Sometimes life doesn't work
out the way we planned.

820
00:46:51.783 --> 00:46:53.051
- No. it doesn't.

821
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.089
- Well. now you owe me.

822
00:46:58.089 --> 00:47:00.358
Can I take you for coffee sometime?

823
00:47:00.358 --> 00:47:01.993
- Perhaps. Text me sometime.

824
00:47:03.261 --> 00:47:04.562
- How about now?

825
00:47:04.562 --> 00:47:06.097
- I have confessions.

826
00:47:07.065 --> 00:47:08.299
- Afterwards?

827
00:47:08.299 --> 00:47:09.734
- Homily to write.

828
00:47:35.126 --> 00:47:36.728
Miss Moriarty.

829
00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:38.796
- A little birdie told
me you might be hungry.

830
00:47:38.796 --> 00:47:41.933
I have walnut shrimp. kung pow chicken

831
00:47:41.933 --> 00:47:42.901
and broccoli and beef.

832
00:47:42.901 --> 00:47:43.801
What do you think?

833
00:47:46.938 --> 00:47:48.539
I can take it back.

834
00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:49.340
- No.

835
00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:53.978
it all smells very good.

836
00:47:53.978 --> 00:47:56.748
but uh... You know. come in.

837
00:47:56.748 --> 00:47:57.582
Thank you.

838
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.251
Please forgive the mess.

839
00:48:02.253 --> 00:48:05.323
- And this is for you.

840
00:48:05.323 --> 00:48:07.258
- Oh. this is great one.

841
00:48:07.258 --> 00:48:08.092
Thank you.

842
00:48:09.327 --> 00:48:11.329
Oh. good timing.

843
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:12.530
I am starving.

844
00:48:13.898 --> 00:48:14.766
What do you like?

845
00:48:20.338 --> 00:48:22.206
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

846
00:48:22.206 --> 00:48:24.208
- Oh. no. who did I scandalize now?

847
00:48:25.576 --> 00:48:26.411
Not that.

848
00:48:28.446 --> 00:48:30.581
Not all the streets are lit in town.

849
00:48:32.116 --> 00:48:34.452
It might not be safe for a
woman to walk alone at night.

850
00:48:34.452 --> 00:48:36.621
That's why I recommended--
- The self defense class.

851
00:48:36.621 --> 00:48:37.455
I remember.

852
00:48:39.924 --> 00:48:40.892
What would you suggest?

853
00:48:40.892 --> 00:48:43.194
The way you laid me out on
the side of the church--

854
00:48:43.194 --> 00:48:44.062
- I'm very sorry about that.

855
00:48:44.062 --> 00:48:45.897
- No. you got some moves.

856
00:48:47.198 --> 00:48:50.101
What would I do if someone
grabbed me like this?

857
00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:53.171
Please show me.

858
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:55.039
My life is in your hands.

859
00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:57.475
- Okay. okay quick I'll
show you .

860
00:48:59.777 --> 00:49:00.979
Grab my wrist.

861
00:49:02.647 --> 00:49:04.549
You think hitchhiking.

862
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:06.851
Pull wrist up and twist.

863
00:49:39.183 --> 00:49:41.552
Enough for today.

864
00:49:41.552 --> 00:49:42.987
You practice on your own.

865
00:49:42.987 --> 00:49:44.522
- So how did you learn all this?

866
00:49:44.522 --> 00:49:46.524
Seminary Fight Club?

867
00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:52.730
- No. I learned because
of my brother. actually.

868
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:56.067
- He taught you?

869
00:49:57.235 --> 00:49:58.069
- No.

870
00:50:00.571 --> 00:50:03.608
He went to clubbing one
night and never came home.

871
00:50:03.608 --> 00:50:05.476
I found him in alley.

872
00:50:05.476 --> 00:50:09.414
He died in hospital. blunt force trauma.

873
00:50:11.682 --> 00:50:12.517
I'm so sorry.

874
00:50:14.018 --> 00:50:17.188
Did you find out who--
- A gang.

875
00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:18.856
There was Ustashe graffiti.

876
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.927
They are group like Nazis.

877
00:50:22.927 --> 00:50:25.096
Killed half a million Serbs in World War.

878
00:50:27.598 --> 00:50:29.700
Jews. communists. gypsies too.

879
00:50:31.335 --> 00:50:33.905
There are still people who
call themselves Ustashe

880
00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:36.841
and there are still people who
use any excuse to hate gays.

881
00:50:40.378 --> 00:50:42.346
- Is that why you're Episcopal?

882
00:50:42.346 --> 00:50:44.082
Because of the church's progressive stance

883
00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:45.249
on the gay community?

884
00:50:51.222 --> 00:50:52.723
I'm sorry for what happened.

885
00:50:53.858 --> 00:50:56.127
- My mistake. I shouldn't have told you.

886
00:50:56.127 --> 00:50:57.695
- No. I mean it.

887
00:50:57.695 --> 00:50:59.897
Thank you for telling
me about your brother.

888
00:51:03.134 --> 00:51:03.968
- Sometimes

889
00:51:11.008 --> 00:51:12.743
- Is everything okay?

890
00:51:12.743 --> 00:51:15.446
.

891
00:51:15.446 --> 00:51:17.448
- Yeah. you've been sitting
in that chair all day.

892
00:51:17.448 --> 00:51:18.282
Here. here.

893
00:51:18.282 --> 00:51:19.250
Turn this way. here.

894
00:51:20.918 --> 00:51:22.620
Is that where you're sore?

895
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.454
How about that one?

896
00:51:23.454 --> 00:51:24.889
Yeah. you got a knot right there.

897
00:51:26.824 --> 00:51:29.660
Yeah?

898
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.495
Why don't you get on the ground

899
00:51:30.495 --> 00:51:31.562
so I can get some better leverage?

900
00:51:33.798 --> 00:51:36.901
Okay. I expect best Shiatsu
for what I'm paying you.

901
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:38.269
- That's exactly what you're gonna get.

902
00:51:40.771 --> 00:51:43.474
- Here. take a look at
this when you get a chance.

903
00:51:43.474 --> 00:51:46.244
There is a special
exhibit at an art museum

904
00:51:46.244 --> 00:51:48.880
I thought you might be interested in.

905
00:51:56.654 --> 00:51:57.488
- Okay. okay.

906
00:51:57.488 --> 00:51:58.322
Let me up please.

907
00:51:58.322 --> 00:51:59.524
Please let me up.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

908
00:51:59.524 --> 00:52:00.825
did I hurt you?
- No. no. no.

909
00:52:00.825 --> 00:52:03.060
- Did I do something wrong?
- You were fine.

910
00:52:04.028 --> 00:52:04.862
It's getting late.

911
00:52:04.862 --> 00:52:05.696
I lost track of time.

912
00:52:05.696 --> 00:52:06.664
Please
- Let me clean up.

913
00:52:06.664 --> 00:52:08.032
- No. no. please. please.

914
00:52:08.032 --> 00:52:09.901
I will do dishes.

915
00:52:09.901 --> 00:52:11.202
Thank you for coming and
thank you for dinner.

916
00:52:11.202 --> 00:52:12.036
Thank you.

917
00:52:13.638 --> 00:52:14.472
- Goodnight.

918
00:52:22.847 --> 00:52:24.382
- Could've been good.

919
00:52:24.382 --> 00:52:26.417
Of course. if there wasn't a
desk between you two and me.

920
00:52:26.417 --> 00:52:28.186
- Oh. what was I supposed to do?

921
00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:29.787
Oh. please. Father. let me straddle you

922
00:52:29.787 --> 00:52:31.155
on this side of the desk.

923
00:52:31.155 --> 00:52:33.591
At this rate. he won't
let me within three feet.

924
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:35.226
- Ava.

925
00:52:35.226 --> 00:52:36.227
We need to talk.

926
00:52:37.295 --> 00:52:39.197
Me being in Justamere

927
00:52:39.197 --> 00:52:42.333
It's not helping us save the business.

928
00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:43.868
We're just wasting time.

929
00:52:43.868 --> 00:52:45.203
- But

930
00:52:45.203 --> 00:52:46.804
I need you.

931
00:52:46.804 --> 00:52:48.139
I always need you.

932
00:52:48.139 --> 00:52:49.240
- You're a big girl.

933
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.374
You'll be fine.

934
00:52:50.374 --> 00:52:51.209
Okay?

935
00:52:51.209 --> 00:52:52.977
You just. you stay here.

936
00:52:52.977 --> 00:52:54.712
You keep working your angles.

937
00:52:54.712 --> 00:52:57.815
I'm gonna go back to the
city and keep working mine.

938
00:52:57.815 --> 00:53:00.017
Now. I've been tracing Lloyd's money

939
00:53:00.017 --> 00:53:02.653
and I think I'm getting really close.

940
00:53:04.288 --> 00:53:05.122
Hey.

941
00:53:06.357 --> 00:53:07.692
we're gonna be okay.

942
00:53:09.193 --> 00:53:10.861
Promise you.

943
00:53:16.901 --> 00:53:17.735
- Hey.

944
00:53:17.735 --> 00:53:18.970
Here's the deposit.

945
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:20.504
You came at the perfect time.

946
00:53:20.504 --> 00:53:23.608
Father Radovan is here about the ceremony.

947
00:53:23.608 --> 00:53:25.610
- So he knows about...

948
00:53:28.112 --> 00:53:29.180
- I know about what?

949
00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.148
- I came over to help.

950
00:53:31.148 --> 00:53:33.484
- Yes. with the favors.

951
00:53:33.484 --> 00:53:34.318
- Wonderful.

952
00:53:34.318 --> 00:53:35.219
Then I can go.

953
00:53:35.219 --> 00:53:36.520
- Oh. no you don't.

954
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.623
- Oh. come on.
- Let's go.

955
00:53:40.124 --> 00:53:42.526
- So Gabe told me that Hubert followed me

956
00:53:42.526 --> 00:53:43.728
out of the bar that night.

957
00:53:43.728 --> 00:53:44.795
- What night?

958
00:53:44.795 --> 00:53:46.397
- You stopped him. didn't you?

959
00:53:46.397 --> 00:53:48.499
- Hubert was drunk.

960
00:53:48.499 --> 00:53:51.469
He collapsed on--
- You stopped him. didn't you?

961
00:53:51.469 --> 00:53:52.970
- If you'll let me finish.

962
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.841
Hubert was drinking too
much and he hit his head--

963
00:53:56.841 --> 00:53:59.310
- Wrong answer. Hans. try again.

964
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:03.147
You forget. Father Markovic.
I know all of your secrets.

965
00:54:07.318 --> 00:54:08.886
- Speaking of secrets.

966
00:54:08.886 --> 00:54:11.355
you never let me return the favor.

967
00:54:11.355 --> 00:54:13.958
You grilling me on my personal history.

968
00:54:13.958 --> 00:54:14.959
- Hold on.

969
00:54:14.959 --> 00:54:16.460
I did not grill.

970
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:17.862
- Lightly fried.

971
00:54:20.164 --> 00:54:22.066
- What do you wanna know?

972
00:54:22.066 --> 00:54:22.900
- When you.

973
00:54:26.404 --> 00:54:27.238
do you.

974
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.075
I've never met anyone with your business.

975
00:54:31.075 --> 00:54:32.610
So I don't.

976
00:54:34.011 --> 00:54:37.014
- You wanna ask me about
being a dominatrix?

977
00:54:37.014 --> 00:54:38.482
Go ahead.

978
00:54:38.482 --> 00:54:39.817
I make sure it's safe.

979
00:54:39.817 --> 00:54:41.018
It's legal.
- Legal?

980
00:54:42.486 --> 00:54:43.988
You're not

981
00:54:43.988 --> 00:54:45.656
Amsterdam?

982
00:54:45.656 --> 00:54:48.526
No.

983
00:54:48.526 --> 00:54:51.529
No. I am not Amsterdam or Vegas.

984
00:54:51.529 --> 00:54:52.697
I have to admit plenty of people assume

985
00:54:52.697 --> 00:54:53.631
that I have sex for money

986
00:54:53.631 --> 00:54:55.800
and accuse me of having sex for money.

987
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.270
But no one has ever before
compared me to a city.

988
00:55:00.604 --> 00:55:02.373
Truth be told. in my life

989
00:55:02.373 --> 00:55:07.244
I've only ever had three
romantic partners. shall we say.

990
00:55:11.148 --> 00:55:12.083
What?

991
00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:14.185
- I have more experience than dominatrix.

992
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:16.921
That's funny.

993
00:55:21.258 --> 00:55:23.994
Are you with anyone now?

994
00:55:23.994 --> 00:55:26.664
is there somebody special for you?

995
00:55:26.664 --> 00:55:27.498
- You. buddy.

996
00:55:27.498 --> 00:55:28.966
Laser focus.

997
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.671
No. there was a guy I met years ago

998
00:55:33.671 --> 00:55:37.375
and dated recently. briefly. for a bit.

999
00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:39.577
but he's no good.

1000
00:55:39.577 --> 00:55:42.012
And I guess I just
turned a blind eye to it.

1001
00:55:44.014 --> 00:55:45.549
You know. you owe me an answer.

1002
00:55:46.884 --> 00:55:48.886
Art museum exhibit?

1003
00:55:50.287 --> 00:55:51.555
- That sounds very nice

1004
00:55:51.555 --> 00:55:53.891
and I appreciate the invite. truly I do.

1005
00:55:53.891 --> 00:55:58.262
but I am very busy at
the parish this week.

1006
00:55:58.262 --> 00:56:00.197
- Next week then.

1007
00:56:00.197 --> 00:56:02.166
- Miss Moriarty--
- I'll call you Radovan

1008
00:56:02.166 --> 00:56:04.068
If you call me Ava.

1009
00:56:04.068 --> 00:56:05.636
- That is what they mean. Ava.

1010
00:56:06.937 --> 00:56:08.506
As priest. I have to be very careful

1011
00:56:08.506 --> 00:56:10.608
about what I do and how I am seen.

1012
00:56:13.077 --> 00:56:16.647
- You know. a very
interesting man once told me.

1013
00:56:16.647 --> 00:56:17.481
what was it?

1014
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:20.484
Perhaps you shouldn't let the opinions

1015
00:56:20.484 --> 00:56:22.219
of others dictate what you do.

1016
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:29.760
That night. I rented a car
and followed him out of town.

1017
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.496
If he was selling Oberstein's
art on the black market.

1018
00:56:32.496 --> 00:56:34.432
I'd catch him red handed.

1019
00:58:01.552 --> 00:58:02.386
- Hey. Serb.

1020
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.589
I heard you won't fight
for Boris Vasiliev.

1021
00:58:07.358 --> 00:58:10.761
You shouldn't have come back.

1022
00:58:34.885 --> 00:58:36.787
- Get in the car! Move!

1023
00:58:39.223 --> 00:58:40.057
- Hey.

1024
00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:50.200
- What are you doing here?

1025
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.402
Did you follow me?

1026
00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:52.236
- What?

1027
00:58:52.236 --> 00:58:53.337
No. what do you think I am?

1028
00:58:53.337 --> 00:58:54.305
Crazy?

1029
00:58:54.305 --> 00:58:56.373
What are you doing here?

1030
00:58:56.373 --> 00:58:57.942
- Church insurance premium.

1031
00:59:00.778 --> 00:59:02.413
- That's how you make money. you fight?

1032
00:59:02.413 --> 00:59:05.316
- He clipped my temple.
can you see anything?

1033
00:59:05.316 --> 00:59:07.518
- Little late to be worrying
about your modeling career.

1034
00:59:07.518 --> 00:59:08.552
- I'm serious.

1035
00:59:08.552 --> 00:59:09.386
What do you think?

1036
00:59:09.386 --> 00:59:10.220
I don't want to lie

1037
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:13.624
to church board members.

1038
00:59:13.624 --> 00:59:15.492
- I'm betting on a black eye by morning.

1039
00:59:16.694 --> 00:59:17.528
Let me take you to my place.

1040
00:59:17.528 --> 00:59:18.729
I got a killer concealer.

1041
00:59:18.729 --> 00:59:19.697
- No.

1042
00:59:19.697 --> 00:59:20.931
no. it's okay.

1043
00:59:20.931 --> 00:59:22.466
I'll say I tripped in shower.

1044
00:59:23.834 --> 00:59:25.069
- You're a sucky liar.

1045
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:26.003
They'll think you had a session

1046
00:59:26.003 --> 00:59:27.605
with the new dominatrix in town.

1047
00:59:30.941 --> 00:59:32.476
- You think so. for real?

1048
00:59:33.811 --> 00:59:35.279
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

1049
00:59:37.348 --> 00:59:40.017
- So tell me what you're
doing with my concealer.

1050
00:59:40.017 --> 00:59:43.687
- Apply with fingers in layers.

1051
00:59:43.687 --> 00:59:45.055
- And if it's still purple?

1052
00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:47.625
- Use yellow corrector.

1053
00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:50.594
I'm so proud

1054
00:59:52.863 --> 00:59:53.731
- Interesting ink.

1055
00:59:53.731 --> 00:59:55.366
What's it mean?

1056
00:59:55.366 --> 00:59:56.200
- That was a

1057
00:59:57.635 --> 00:59:59.103
mistake.

1058
00:59:59.103 --> 01:00:01.639
- Well. I knew what my next
Google search would be.

1059
01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:41.712
Are you okay?

1060
01:00:41.712 --> 01:00:44.515
- Are you still going to that
art exhibit you mentioned?

1061
01:00:54.725 --> 01:00:56.126
This is Tesla. yes?

1062
01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:58.395
- Model S 70D
- Beautiful.

1063
01:00:59.596 --> 01:01:01.999
Nikola Tesla was Serbian. you know?

1064
01:01:01.999 --> 01:01:03.233
- I know.

1065
01:01:03.233 --> 01:01:04.835
You're into cars?

1066
01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:08.906
- Miss Moriarty. last time I checked.

1067
01:01:08.906 --> 01:01:10.474
I am still a man.

1068
01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:13.677
- Well. this bad boy goes
zero to 60 in five seconds flat.

1069
01:01:15.012 --> 01:01:16.814
- You call it "him"?

1070
01:01:16.814 --> 01:01:18.549
Isn't it always "her"?

1071
01:01:19.583 --> 01:01:21.185
- Not when I'm doing the riding.

1072
01:01:26.156 --> 01:01:27.291
- What's his name?

1073
01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:30.027
- I'm not one of those crazy
people who names my car.

1074
01:01:30.027 --> 01:01:31.261
- Oh. crazy people like me?

1075
01:01:31.261 --> 01:01:32.996
- Oh. I could just guess
what you named your car.

1076
01:01:32.996 --> 01:01:33.897
- What?

1077
01:01:33.897 --> 01:01:35.299
- Wilma.
- Wilma?

1078
01:01:35.299 --> 01:01:36.200
- It looks like a Wilma.

1079
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.302
Do not tell me it doesn't
look like a Wilma.

1080
01:01:38.302 --> 01:01:43.302
- Do not insult Gertrude.

1081
01:01:55.588 --> 01:01:58.591
- Good job. this one's
harder than it looks.

1082
01:01:58.591 --> 01:01:59.725
Right?

1083
01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:03.128
Matching tone and value is killing me.

1084
01:02:04.797 --> 01:02:06.165
- Is Plummer your prof?

1085
01:02:06.165 --> 01:02:07.232
He loves this one.

1086
01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:09.101
- Totally.

1087
01:02:10.469 --> 01:02:11.570
Are you a student too?

1088
01:02:12.638 --> 01:02:14.506
- No. I graduated a while back.

1089
01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.511
- I'm Lana.

1090
01:02:19.511 --> 01:02:20.879
- Ava.

1091
01:02:20.879 --> 01:02:22.815
- Not Ava Moriarty.

1092
01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:26.318
- Yeah.

1093
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.088
- Oh my God.

1094
01:02:30.322 --> 01:02:33.025
Plummer has not stopped talking about you.

1095
01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:35.761
I can't believe I
actually get to meet you.

1096
01:02:36.996 --> 01:02:40.599
Were you really only. like. 20
when you got your masters?

1097
01:02:40.599 --> 01:02:42.868
- One year older than Jordan Gronendyke.

1098
01:02:43.869 --> 01:02:44.703
Don't be too impressed.

1099
01:02:44.703 --> 01:02:45.638
that was a while ago.

1100
01:02:45.638 --> 01:02:48.107
- Nothing impresses
Plummer and you sure did.

1101
01:02:49.742 --> 01:02:50.809
What are you up to now?

1102
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.611
- Oh. just starring as the poster child

1103
01:02:52.611 --> 01:02:54.847
for unequivocal failure.

1104
01:02:54.847 --> 01:02:58.550
- Miss Moriarty is helping
St. Michael's Episcopal.

1105
01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:00.452
She is appraising our
historic art collection

1106
01:03:00.452 --> 01:03:02.955
and it's provenance.

1107
01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.191
You got your master's at age 20?

1108
01:03:06.258 --> 01:03:07.893
That's incredible.

1109
01:03:07.893 --> 01:03:10.863
- Yeah. that and three bucks
and I could ride the bus too.

1110
01:03:10.863 --> 01:03:12.631
Thanks for saving me back there.

1111
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:13.465
- You didn't need saving.

1112
01:03:13.465 --> 01:03:15.901
I just told the truth.

1113
01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:19.838
Don't dismiss your
accomplishments. Moriarty.

1114
01:03:22.274 --> 01:03:24.076
- I never finished my doctorate.

1115
01:03:26.311 --> 01:03:27.112
- So?

1116
01:03:40.826 --> 01:03:43.128
There's a concert of
love songs next month.

1117
01:03:44.263 --> 01:03:46.632
My mother would love that.

1118
01:03:46.632 --> 01:03:47.766
- Not you?

1119
01:03:47.766 --> 01:03:51.036
- I like her favorite one.
"Masterpiece" something.

1120
01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:51.870
I think.

1121
01:03:53.405 --> 01:03:54.239
- Wanna see the theater?

1122
01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:55.074
Come on.

1123
01:04:00.279 --> 01:04:02.281
I think I know your mom's favorite song.

1124
01:04:03.482 --> 01:04:04.950
It's one of my favorites too.

1125
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.044
- Excuse me.

1126
01:05:06.044 --> 01:05:06.879
You can't be in here.

1127
01:05:06.879 --> 01:05:08.046
The hall is closed.

1128
01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:17.022
- No one had ever looked
at me that way before

1129
01:05:17.022 --> 01:05:18.423
and I wish he always could.

1130
01:05:49.555 --> 01:05:50.823
W-T-F Lloyd.

1131
01:05:50.823 --> 01:05:52.424
My money was tied up in this?

1132
01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:53.926
Who paid this much to live in cornfields?

1133
01:05:59.932 --> 01:06:01.066
The church!

1134
01:06:01.066 --> 01:06:02.467
Radovan!

1135
01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:06.638
- No. no. Majko!

1136
01:06:06.638 --> 01:06:07.472
Majko. no!

1137
01:06:07.472 --> 01:06:08.307
No!

1138
01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.942
No!

1139
01:06:09.942 --> 01:06:11.310
I need help!

1140
01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.144
Help me hold her!

1141
01:06:12.144 --> 01:06:13.846
She's lost her mind!

1142
01:06:13.846 --> 01:06:15.247
- My painting!

1143
01:06:15.247 --> 01:06:17.616
My painting is in there!

1144
01:06:18.116 --> 01:06:18.951
- I'll get it!
- No!

1145
01:06:18.951 --> 01:06:20.953
Ava. you can't go in there. no!

1146
01:06:20.953 --> 01:06:22.487
- I have to get the painting!

1147
01:06:22.487 --> 01:06:24.957
- It's nothing. it's
worthless. let it burn!

1148
01:06:24.957 --> 01:06:25.791
- Let me go!

1149
01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:28.126
- Ava. her uncle painted
it. it's worthless.

1150
01:06:28.126 --> 01:06:29.127
Let it burn!

1151
01:06:30.562 --> 01:06:31.930
- He didn't know.

1152
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:32.898
- Majko. breathe.

1153
01:06:32.898 --> 01:06:34.099
I need help!

1154
01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:35.667
Majko!

1155
01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:37.302
Ava!

1156
01:06:37.302 --> 01:06:38.537
- You cannot go in there!

1157
01:06:38.537 --> 01:06:39.338
You cannot go in there!

1158
01:06:39.338 --> 01:06:41.740
- You have to go in there!
- You cannot--

1159
01:07:19.378 --> 01:07:20.212
- Trapped!

1160
01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:20.072
- You crazy woman!

1161
01:08:20.072 --> 01:08:21.740
You want to be a hero so bad!

1162
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.308
You could have killed yourself!

1163
01:08:24.476 --> 01:08:25.877
- I just saved one

1164
01:08:25.877 --> 01:08:29.348
of the world's greatest lost masterpieces.

1165
01:08:29.348 --> 01:08:30.482
- What the hell are you talking about?

1166
01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:32.617
It is an ugly painting by my uncle.

1167
01:08:33.719 --> 01:08:35.654
- This is a Merisi!

1168
01:08:35.654 --> 01:08:37.456
You don't even know who
the hell that is. do you?

1169
01:08:37.456 --> 01:08:38.290
- I don't care.

1170
01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:40.292
It's a piece of canvas with paint on it.

1171
01:08:40.292 --> 01:08:42.494
- What's wrong with you?

1172
01:08:42.494 --> 01:08:45.764
That is a priceless work of art worth

1173
01:08:45.764 --> 01:08:47.132
more than 30 of your churches.

1174
01:08:47.132 --> 01:08:49.701
- It is not worth your life.

1175
01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.538
- Who the hell do you think you are?

1176
01:08:53.538 --> 01:08:55.007
- I decide that.

1177
01:08:55.007 --> 01:08:56.475
Not you.

1178
01:08:56.475 --> 01:08:58.910
You don't know the first thing about me.

1179
01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:01.113
I'm a worthless piece of
shit for all you know.

1180
01:09:01.113 --> 01:09:01.947
- I don't know about that.

1181
01:09:01.947 --> 01:09:05.650
but I know you are a stupid idiot.

1182
01:09:09.855 --> 01:09:11.690
- You think I'm lazy and easy too?

1183
01:09:13.258 --> 01:09:14.726
- I don't know what to think anymore.

1184
01:09:14.726 --> 01:09:17.829
You throw your life away to be dominatrix.

1185
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:20.098
You throw your life away for a painting.

1186
01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:24.002
- You threw your life away to
become a judgmental hypocrite.

1187
01:09:24.002 --> 01:09:25.103
Getting your skull bashed in

1188
01:09:25.103 --> 01:09:28.240
so you can keep spinning fairy
tales to an empty church.

1189
01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.074
- You know what?

1190
01:09:29.074 --> 01:09:31.243
You're right. I am a stupid idiot.

1191
01:09:31.243 --> 01:09:34.613
This. us. was a stupid idea.

1192
01:09:35.647 --> 01:09:38.283
- You're no different from any of them.

1193
01:09:38.283 --> 01:09:40.719
It doesn't matter what I do or say.

1194
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.954
You think I'm a whore.

1195
01:09:42.954 --> 01:09:44.890
- I think you're insane.

1196
01:09:45.824 --> 01:09:46.658
- Bite me.

1197
01:09:46.658 --> 01:09:50.829
- Oh. classy act.
Moriarty. really class act.

1198
01:09:56.334 --> 01:09:59.204
- For a moment. I'd felt like a hero.

1199
01:09:59.204 --> 01:10:01.206
I thought this failure
could redeem herself

1200
01:10:01.206 --> 01:10:03.008
in everyone's eyes.

1201
01:10:03.008 --> 01:10:04.709
In his eyes.

1202
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:05.944
In my own eyes.

1203
01:10:09.114 --> 01:10:10.615
I was stupid.

1204
01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.455
You've reached Ava Moriarty.

1205
01:10:16.455 --> 01:10:17.956
I'm not available right now.

1206
01:10:30.235 --> 01:10:32.938
The flowers were a surprise.
as was the hospital bill.

1207
01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:35.373
And I'd almost forgotten the
bachelor party was tonight.

1208
01:10:35.373 --> 01:10:36.908
- Hello. Ava.

1209
01:10:36.908 --> 01:10:37.742
- Hey.

1210
01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:39.845
- Where's the money?

1211
01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:42.547
- Boris gave me a month.

1212
01:10:42.547 --> 01:10:44.015
- Boris changed his mind.

1213
01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:46.751
He needs the money for
tomorrow's tournament.

1214
01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:50.555
See. your boy won't work for
him even when we ask nice.

1215
01:10:50.555 --> 01:10:53.125
And you were no help.

1216
01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:54.359
- Look. guys.

1217
01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.794
you gotta talk to him.

1218
01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:58.663
Come on. you hurt me.
he doesn't get anything.

1219
01:10:58.663 --> 01:10:59.531
Nobody wins.

1220
01:10:59.531 --> 01:11:00.365
- You like Vegas?

1221
01:11:00.365 --> 01:11:02.467
I like Vegas.

1222
01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.468
Roulette's my game.

1223
01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:06.004
I might have to take a
early trip this year.

1224
01:11:06.004 --> 01:11:11.004
I might have to go stay at
82 Sunrise Lane. Henderson.

1225
01:11:12.377 --> 01:11:13.211
- Look. Viktor.

1226
01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:15.647
Don't bring my mom into this.

1227
01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:18.750
This is on me and I'm not the enemy.

1228
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.385
You know me.

1229
01:11:20.385 --> 01:11:21.219
- Oh. I do.

1230
01:11:21.219 --> 01:11:24.623
So go find another
sugar daddy and put out.

1231
01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:28.293
- Thanks for being flexible.

1232
01:11:28.293 --> 01:11:29.494
Go suck yourself.

1233
01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:34.566
- Let me make this painfully clear.

1234
01:11:47.846 --> 01:11:50.582
You have 24 hours to pay up.

1235
01:11:50.582 --> 01:11:51.416
- You run.

1236
01:11:56.721 --> 01:11:58.857
- We go sun bathe with mommy.

1237
01:12:04.763 --> 01:12:06.364
- Freaking firebug!

1238
01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:12.237
Firebug.

1239
01:12:12.237 --> 01:12:13.505
The church fire.

1240
01:12:13.505 --> 01:12:15.307
Boris's revenge on Radovan.

1241
01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:18.009
Ding. ding. ding.

1242
01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:20.845
Dracula was right.

1243
01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.281
I was stupid

1244
01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:25.083
with a history of stupid.

1245
01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:26.818
- Fire has ravaged a church

1246
01:12:26.818 --> 01:12:28.954
in Justamere Town. south of Chicago.

1247
01:12:28.954 --> 01:12:32.757
But is St. Michael's Episcopal
merely the latest casualty?

1248
01:12:32.757 --> 01:12:33.959
The property is part

1249
01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:36.828
of the hotly contested
expansion of Route 27.

1250
01:12:36.828 --> 01:12:39.497
leading some just speculate
that last night's fire

1251
01:12:39.497 --> 01:12:42.200
was merely the latest
act of arson designed

1252
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.302
to force owners to move.

1253
01:12:45.136 --> 01:12:46.504
In other news. sources say law enforcement

1254
01:12:46.504 --> 01:12:49.241
is closing in on an
underground gambling operation

1255
01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:50.242
with mob ties.

1256
01:12:50.242 --> 01:12:52.477
We investigate at 10.

1257
01:12:52.477 --> 01:12:54.279
- I heard you were at the fire last night.

1258
01:12:54.279 --> 01:12:56.214
I'm glad I wasn't.

1259
01:12:56.214 --> 01:12:58.149
I'm guessing it's all over now.

1260
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:59.384
- What is?

1261
01:12:59.384 --> 01:13:02.254
- The church was barely staying
above water financially.

1262
01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:04.256
And now with all the fire damage.

1263
01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:05.924
you know. there's not enough money

1264
01:13:05.924 --> 01:13:07.192
to even pay the rent.

1265
01:13:08.627 --> 01:13:09.861
- Rent?

1266
01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:11.596
The church pays rent?

1267
01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:14.733
- The building's owned by
Justamere Trust or something.

1268
01:13:14.733 --> 01:13:17.202
Radovan's handling all of that.

1269
01:13:17.202 --> 01:13:18.670
They've gone easy on us.

1270
01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:20.472
not even charging us for years.

1271
01:13:20.472 --> 01:13:24.142
But any businessman with
half a brain will sell out

1272
01:13:24.142 --> 01:13:25.110
to the highway now.

1273
01:13:27.012 --> 01:13:28.313
- The highway extension.

1274
01:13:29.547 --> 01:13:31.349
- Rad doesn't like talking about it.

1275
01:13:32.217 --> 01:13:33.051
But the mayor has based

1276
01:13:33.051 --> 01:13:35.420
his entire re-election campaign on it.

1277
01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.588
- Why?

1278
01:13:36.588 --> 01:13:37.622
What does it mean for Justamere?

1279
01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:39.024
Well. lots of new developments.

1280
01:13:39.024 --> 01:13:41.293
where there's just cornfields.

1281
01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:44.162
The mayor's townhouses would finally sell.

1282
01:13:44.162 --> 01:13:46.965
but St. Michael's is right
where an on-ramp would be.

1283
01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:53.204
- I've been asking the wrong questions

1284
01:13:53.204 --> 01:13:54.639
about the wrong century.

1285
01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:57.475
Lloyd's development deal
would make us a fortune.

1286
01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:00.045
Like him though. I
wouldn't live to see it.

1287
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.205
That's what
I'm talking about. baby.

1288
01:14:27.205 --> 01:14:30.508
- A little birdie told me there
was a bachelor at the party.

1289
01:14:42.287 --> 01:14:43.688
- Oh. yeah.

1290
01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.023
- Come on. Kurt.

1291
01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:55.867
- It ain't a real show
until we see some boobs.

1292
01:14:57.102 --> 01:14:59.371
- Come on. sit down.

1293
01:14:59.371 --> 01:15:01.940
- Maybe it was the stress
of losing a half million.

1294
01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.608
Maybe it was watching the smoldering ashes

1295
01:15:03.608 --> 01:15:05.343
of my life and deciding to burn the bridge

1296
01:15:05.343 --> 01:15:06.978
for shits and giggles.

1297
01:15:06.978 --> 01:15:09.414
Or maybe it was latex giving
me the world's worst wedgie

1298
01:15:09.414 --> 01:15:11.983
where I just had glass picked out.

1299
01:15:11.983 --> 01:15:13.218
I was done.

1300
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:16.187
- I got your "Fifty Shades"
right here for you. baby.

1301
01:15:16.187 --> 01:15:18.256
- Get off the pier. take the chair.

1302
01:15:18.256 --> 01:15:21.159
I've had more
excitement at a baby shower.

1303
01:15:21.159 --> 01:15:21.993
- Hey!

1304
01:15:21.993 --> 01:15:22.927
Shut the hell up!

1305
01:15:22.927 --> 01:15:23.962
You're ruining the show!

1306
01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:26.698
- Why don't you come up here and join me.

1307
01:15:26.698 --> 01:15:27.532
Do it. do it

1308
01:15:27.532 --> 01:15:28.366
Do it. do it. do it. do it

1309
01:15:28.366 --> 01:15:29.200
Okay. baby.

1310
01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.302
Things are about to get interesting.

1311
01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:37.675
- We're gonna do a
different type of show now.

1312
01:15:37.675 --> 01:15:39.210
a little roleplaying.

1313
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.044
- Yeah.

1314
01:15:40.044 --> 01:15:43.415
- Only. you get to be
yourself. an asshole.

1315
01:15:43.415 --> 01:15:46.351
And I get to be myself. a dick.

1316
01:15:46.351 --> 01:15:47.886
Do you know what that means?

1317
01:15:49.988 --> 01:15:52.123
Let me go.

1318
01:15:52.123 --> 01:15:55.693
- Insulting women will
not solve your insecurity.

1319
01:15:55.693 --> 01:15:59.130
Objectifying us doesn't cure micropenis.

1320
01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:00.465
- Help. she's crazy.

1321
01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.269
- That's not your safe word.

1322
01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:07.705
But you sure got a purty mouth. boy.

1323
01:16:07.705 --> 01:16:10.542
I bet you can squeal like a pig.

1324
01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:18.783
The face of the world
is changing. dickshiner.

1325
01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:20.452
And it doesn't look like you.

1326
01:16:31.029 --> 01:16:34.098
I can't swim. I can't swim!

1327
01:16:40.872 --> 01:16:42.640
To hell with this shit.

1328
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.849
What could I do with only
one day left to live?

1329
01:16:53.551 --> 01:16:56.821
What could I do in a day
with nothing left to lose?

1330
01:17:10.935 --> 01:17:11.769
Morning.

1331
01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.609
- We have new visitor.

1332
01:17:17.609 --> 01:17:18.576
Happy Sunday.

1333
01:17:19.511 --> 01:17:21.446
- Still having church?

1334
01:17:21.446 --> 01:17:24.849
- Jesus said. "Where two
or more gather in my name.

1335
01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.985
"there am I with them."

1336
01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.921
- Book of Matthew.

1337
01:17:31.623 --> 01:17:33.424
That's right.

1338
01:17:33.424 --> 01:17:35.260
Okay. homily over.

1339
01:17:36.661 --> 01:17:38.563
- No. I'm sure you wrote a good one

1340
01:17:38.563 --> 01:17:40.465
and I would love to hear it.

1341
01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:43.334
- Well. I wrote the first one

1342
01:17:43.334 --> 01:17:45.770
about Ecclesiastes 3.

1343
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:46.638
about change.

1344
01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:52.610
Especially as I realize I
stayed priest for wrong reasons.

1345
01:17:53.778 --> 01:17:58.249
I think it's time for a change.

1346
01:18:00.985 --> 01:18:02.954
Shortest mass ever. I get prize.

1347
01:18:04.756 --> 01:18:06.958
- So. let's hear the second one.

1348
01:18:09.027 --> 01:18:13.064
- Well. that was about forgiveness.

1349
01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:15.900
Asking for forgiveness.

1350
01:18:18.603 --> 01:18:19.871
- Oh.

1351
01:18:19.871 --> 01:18:22.874
- Of God. first of all.
but that's easy to do.

1352
01:18:22.874 --> 01:18:26.177
God is father. God is perfect.

1353
01:18:26.177 --> 01:18:28.479
.

1354
01:18:28.479 --> 01:18:32.116
God does not drop his cell phone.

1355
01:18:35.353 --> 01:18:38.423
But it's harder to
apologize to other people.

1356
01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:41.559
Sometimes we have good motives.

1357
01:18:41.559 --> 01:18:43.795
but we do or say the wrong things.

1358
01:18:43.795 --> 01:18:47.465
Sometimes there are things
we wish we could take back.

1359
01:18:48.399 --> 01:18:51.603
For example. I wish I could
take back how I hurt you.

1360
01:18:52.537 --> 01:18:56.474
And I'm sorry for how I attacked you.

1361
01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:00.278
- You were right.

1362
01:19:01.145 --> 01:19:03.848
It's only someone really messed up

1363
01:19:03.848 --> 01:19:07.185
who thinks that a painting
is worth more than her life.

1364
01:19:07.185 --> 01:19:11.222
- I should have shown
compassion. not judgment.

1365
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:14.692
Are you okay?

1366
01:19:17.662 --> 01:19:18.496
- No.

1367
01:19:19.497 --> 01:19:20.498
- Excuse me. Father.

1368
01:19:20.498 --> 01:19:21.566
Can I get confession?

1369
01:19:23.101 --> 01:19:23.935
- Of course. John.

1370
01:19:23.935 --> 01:19:25.069
Follow me.

1371
01:19:25.069 --> 01:19:28.039
The confessional is still intact.

1372
01:19:28.039 --> 01:19:29.674
Thank you.

1373
01:19:48.559 --> 01:19:51.629
- Friday night. you said
I threw my life away

1374
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:53.164
to become what I am.

1375
01:19:53.164 --> 01:19:55.900
- I misspoke. I--
- Mistress Maneater

1376
01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.002
is not how I pictured my life.

1377
01:20:01.973 --> 01:20:04.475
My PhD dissertation
was gonna be on Merisi.

1378
01:20:05.943 --> 01:20:07.378
- Merisi?

1379
01:20:07.378 --> 01:20:08.579
Same painter as--
- Yep

1380
01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:11.282
Brilliant artist.

1381
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:15.353
Killed a man. died young in exile.

1382
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:20.224
- What happened to you?

1383
01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.830
- There was this internship

1384
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:27.565
that 300 of us wanted.

1385
01:20:28.733 --> 01:20:30.802
The department head. Solomon.

1386
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:34.439
said I wouldn't beat out the top 10.

1387
01:20:36.274 --> 01:20:38.810
I wasn't.

1388
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:40.144
I wasn't enough.

1389
01:20:41.679 --> 01:20:43.648
- Was that true?

1390
01:20:43.648 --> 01:20:44.882
- I don't know.

1391
01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:48.886
I thought.

1392
01:20:51.322 --> 01:20:52.724
I thought I could trust him.

1393
01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:58.396
He promised to recommend
me for the position

1394
01:20:58.396 --> 01:21:00.665
if I went to this costume party with him.

1395
01:21:01.833 --> 01:21:03.201
He said he needed to impress

1396
01:21:03.201 --> 01:21:05.336
the host. some big donor from Russia.

1397
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:07.438
- What happened?

1398
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.875
- Solomon got me alone at the party.

1399
01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:19.851
- I told him no.

1400
01:21:23.788 --> 01:21:25.056
- I'm so sorry.

1401
01:21:25.056 --> 01:21:26.858
- I'm not the one to feel sorry for.

1402
01:21:52.817 --> 01:21:54.552
Viktor thinks he's into BDSM.

1403
01:21:54.552 --> 01:21:56.487
but that would require consent.

1404
01:21:58.556 --> 01:22:00.658
I was terrified of saying no again.

1405
01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.130
So I became his puppet.

1406
01:22:10.835 --> 01:22:12.770
The host. my future ex.

1407
01:22:13.838 --> 01:22:14.972
came in and stopped it.

1408
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:33.791
But it was too late.

1409
01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:35.660
Someone posted a video of it online.

1410
01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:40.164
When that went viral. people
came out of the woodwork

1411
01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.300
to get punished by Mistress Maneater.

1412
01:22:43.367 --> 01:22:45.670
Big people who paid a lot of money.

1413
01:22:47.038 --> 01:22:48.406
What about Solomon?

1414
01:22:49.574 --> 01:22:50.975
- He disappeared that night.

1415
01:22:52.376 --> 01:22:53.477
He was alive when I left.

1416
01:22:53.477 --> 01:22:54.312
but

1417
01:22:55.947 --> 01:22:56.881
my ex killed him.

1418
01:22:59.884 --> 01:23:02.453
All these years. I wouldn't believe it.

1419
01:23:04.322 --> 01:23:07.491
A decade later he calls me
up and I go out with him.

1420
01:23:08.492 --> 01:23:09.327
Stupid.

1421
01:23:10.728 --> 01:23:13.030
- I'm glad he didn't
kill you with Solomon.

1422
01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:18.669
- You know. at the time.

1423
01:23:21.005 --> 01:23:25.977
I wished I was dead.

1424
01:23:25.977 --> 01:23:28.145
I was a suspect in the disappearance.

1425
01:23:31.349 --> 01:23:33.584
I got expelled from the PhD program.

1426
01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:43.194
Any school or employer Googles my name.

1427
01:23:43.194 --> 01:23:44.562
there's that video forever.

1428
01:23:50.468 --> 01:23:52.870
My ex called me a stupid idiot.

1429
01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:57.942
and lazy. and easy and a whore.

1430
01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:03.180
And I've heard it so much and for so long.

1431
01:24:04.348 --> 01:24:06.284
I think I started to believe it.

1432
01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.152
- I was no better.

1433
01:24:09.553 --> 01:24:11.055
- You didn't know.

1434
01:24:13.357 --> 01:24:15.593
- when you rushed into that fire.

1435
01:24:16.894 --> 01:24:18.195
- You cannot go in there.

1436
01:24:18.195 --> 01:24:19.563
When you
rushed into that fire.

1437
01:24:19.563 --> 01:24:20.798
and I couldn't stop you.

1438
01:24:20.798 --> 01:24:23.267
I thought I'd never see you again.

1439
01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.201
Ava!

1440
01:24:24.201 --> 01:24:26.137
I'd built walls.

1441
01:24:26.137 --> 01:24:28.572
I'd built walls no one could penetrate.

1442
01:24:28.572 --> 01:24:29.407
But

1443
01:24:31.142 --> 01:24:34.779
without me even knowing when or how.

1444
01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:38.916
you walked right through them.

1445
01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:41.719
You make me vulnerable again.

1446
01:24:43.387 --> 01:24:45.289
I was terrified I'd lost you.

1447
01:24:46.657 --> 01:24:49.160
Somebody that common sense dictated

1448
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.494
I could never be with.

1449
01:24:53.397 --> 01:24:57.335
Even if you made it. I'd still lose you.

1450
01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:02.406
The only answer was to shove you away.

1451
01:25:04.842 --> 01:25:08.512
I just. I feel so much
when I'm with you. Ava.

1452
01:25:08.512 --> 01:25:11.315
I don't know what to do
with what's between us.

1453
01:25:14.618 --> 01:25:16.354
You make me feel

1454
01:25:20.224 --> 01:25:21.092
understood.

1455
01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:25.496
Not so alone

1456
01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:26.864
behind my walls.

1457
01:25:28.132 --> 01:25:29.533
because you care.

1458
01:25:32.103 --> 01:25:34.071
- You don't know the whole story.

1459
01:25:34.071 --> 01:25:35.773
That's just what I wanted you to think.

1460
01:25:35.773 --> 01:25:37.808
- I don't think. I know.

1461
01:25:37.808 --> 01:25:38.642
- No.

1462
01:25:40.311 --> 01:25:44.081
Because of my ex. because
of money I owe him.

1463
01:25:45.483 --> 01:25:46.317
a lot of money.

1464
01:25:49.286 --> 01:25:50.988
I agreed to do something horrible.

1465
01:25:52.890 --> 01:25:54.025
So he wouldn't hurt me.

1466
01:25:58.662 --> 01:26:00.664
And now I can't go through with it.

1467
01:26:00.664 --> 01:26:02.099
- That's wonderful.

1468
01:26:03.601 --> 01:26:07.471
You chose the right path
because you are a good person.

1469
01:26:07.471 --> 01:26:09.273
- You don't know me.

1470
01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:14.273
- I know you are most
incredible woman I've ever met.

1471
01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:18.649
You are light in a dark place. Ava.

1472
01:26:20.484 --> 01:26:22.486
You are not an object.

1473
01:26:22.486 --> 01:26:24.355
you are genius.

1474
01:26:35.633 --> 01:26:36.467
- Ava?

1475
01:26:42.973 --> 01:26:44.508
- When were you going to
tell me the real reason

1476
01:26:44.508 --> 01:26:45.476
you hired me?

1477
01:26:45.476 --> 01:26:46.310
- I didn't hire you

1478
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:49.213
to be a private
investigator. Miss Moriarty.

1479
01:26:49.213 --> 01:26:52.083
I hired you to do what you do best.

1480
01:26:52.983 --> 01:26:55.186
And I believe you
exhibited that last night.

1481
01:26:56.787 --> 01:26:58.823
- Disciplining chauvinist assholes?

1482
01:26:58.823 --> 01:27:00.891
Yeah. I'm good at that.

1483
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:01.892
When were you going to tell me

1484
01:27:01.892 --> 01:27:03.961
about your arsonists burning property

1485
01:27:03.961 --> 01:27:05.396
throughout the entire county?

1486
01:27:05.396 --> 01:27:07.264
- Are you an arson investigator?

1487
01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:08.732
A fire marshal?

1488
01:27:09.633 --> 01:27:13.104
No. you're a stripper. right?

1489
01:27:14.138 --> 01:27:17.374
- You had St. Michael's torched.

1490
01:27:17.374 --> 01:27:18.876
- Those are groundless accusations

1491
01:27:18.876 --> 01:27:21.145
and you don't know what
you're talking about.

1492
01:27:21.145 --> 01:27:24.315
This town needs that
highway and new development.

1493
01:27:24.315 --> 01:27:26.817
- Oh. it needs a mayor
who'll extort innocent men?

1494
01:27:26.817 --> 01:27:29.253
Save me the stump speech.

1495
01:27:29.253 --> 01:27:31.856
I don't want your money.

1496
01:27:31.856 --> 01:27:32.690
I'm out.

1497
01:27:51.041 --> 01:27:54.211
Everyone loses
everything sooner or later.

1498
01:27:54.211 --> 01:27:56.747
So what did it mean to truly live?

1499
01:27:56.747 --> 01:27:58.215
To truly win?

1500
01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.451
Being happy.

1501
01:28:01.418 --> 01:28:04.455
Tonight. I would be happy.

1502
01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:08.993
- May I have this dance?

1503
01:28:14.365 --> 01:28:16.133
- Check out my asshole ex.

1504
01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:18.869
Radovan?

1505
01:28:18.869 --> 01:28:19.703
What the--

1506
01:28:26.043 --> 01:28:28.145
- Your ex boyfriend is Boris Vasiliev?

1507
01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.548
- Yeah.

1508
01:28:30.548 --> 01:28:31.782
so?

1509
01:28:32.816 --> 01:28:35.085
Please don't tell me
you owe him money too.

1510
01:28:35.085 --> 01:28:36.987
- No. no. I don't owe him money.

1511
01:28:36.987 --> 01:28:39.390
- Is this about the guys who
beat you up on Wednesday?

1512
01:28:40.257 --> 01:28:41.091
- No.

1513
01:28:42.193 --> 01:28:45.896
Yes. you don't wanna know.

1514
01:28:47.164 --> 01:28:49.500
- Is this about the fake
passport in your name?

1515
01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:03.280
Well. he's called my loan due tonight.

1516
01:29:04.682 --> 01:29:09.653
So I'm going to enjoy a high
calorie. high octane cocktail

1517
01:29:10.354 --> 01:29:12.056
and a very nice last supper.

1518
01:29:13.724 --> 01:29:15.926
Unless you got 700K sitting around.

1519
01:29:20.297 --> 01:29:21.131
That's okay.

1520
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.803
That's not why I fell for
you. Radovan Markovic.

1521
01:29:30.741 --> 01:29:32.710
You were my light in a dark place too.

1522
01:29:38.048 --> 01:29:38.882
- Ava.

1523
01:29:41.719 --> 01:29:43.821
Radovan Markovic is dead.

1524
01:29:46.023 --> 01:29:47.558
He died 20 years ago

1525
01:29:49.326 --> 01:29:50.160
in the war.

1526
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:52.463
I killed him.

1527
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.302
War in Bosnia had already begun.

1528
01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:02.239
The day I graduated secondary school.

1529
01:30:02.239 --> 01:30:03.941
I joined my friends in militia.

1530
01:30:03.941 --> 01:30:05.242
I don't even know why.

1531
01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:08.112
Be some hero.

1532
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.415
to avenge my brother's murder.

1533
01:30:12.816 --> 01:30:14.018
be some patriot.

1534
01:30:15.119 --> 01:30:16.920
An eye for an eye.

1535
01:30:19.056 --> 01:30:20.291
I was a boy.

1536
01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:21.925
I was a stupid boy.

1537
01:30:23.761 --> 01:30:26.630
Boris Vasiliev was with paramilitary too.

1538
01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:29.400
The White Wolves. Russians.

1539
01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:31.902
My unit was Chetnik.

1540
01:30:33.771 --> 01:30:36.874
Markovic. he looked
like me and my brother.

1541
01:30:39.209 --> 01:30:40.844
Same coloring. same build.

1542
01:30:42.112 --> 01:30:44.481
And when I told him about Milos' murder.

1543
01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:45.382
he said.

1544
01:30:46.617 --> 01:30:50.154
"Now I will be your brother."

1545
01:30:50.154 --> 01:30:52.256
And then Srebrenica happened.

1546
01:30:54.191 --> 01:30:55.025
It was chaos.

1547
01:30:55.025 --> 01:30:56.827
It was a sea of blood.

1548
01:30:58.128 --> 01:30:59.430
There was a Bosniak mother.

1549
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:00.931
She was pregnant.

1550
01:31:02.599 --> 01:31:05.169
Markovic cornered her and...

1551
01:31:07.805 --> 01:31:09.340
I arrived too late.

1552
01:31:12.276 --> 01:31:14.478
There was a little girl.

1553
01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:19.550
she was six or seven years old.

1554
01:31:21.618 --> 01:31:24.988
She sat there screaming
over her mother's body.

1555
01:31:24.988 --> 01:31:27.624
I tried to drag Markovic away.

1556
01:31:27.624 --> 01:31:28.459
I tried to stop him

1557
01:31:28.459 --> 01:31:30.828
but he had ten kilos on me. easy.

1558
01:31:35.999 --> 01:31:38.602
I knew what he did to other little girls.

1559
01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:43.140
He grabbed her hair in his hand like this

1560
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.708
and she saw me from behind him

1561
01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.677
and she started screaming at me.

1562
01:31:49.313 --> 01:31:50.147
Pomozi mi!

1563
01:31:51.448 --> 01:31:54.118
Over. and over and over again.

1564
01:31:54.118 --> 01:31:56.053
Pomozi mi. pomozi mi.

1565
01:31:59.022 --> 01:32:00.090
Help me.

1566
01:32:01.925 --> 01:32:05.028
The next thing I knew.
she was covered in blood.

1567
01:32:05.929 --> 01:32:07.097
But she wasn't hurt.

1568
01:32:09.366 --> 01:32:13.237
There was a knife in my hand
and Markovic was at my feet.

1569
01:32:14.505 --> 01:32:17.007
his head almost off from his body.

1570
01:32:19.676 --> 01:32:24.676
I grabbed his gun. his three
clips of ammo. and his passport

1571
01:32:24.948 --> 01:32:26.850
and I became him.

1572
01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:27.684
And I ran.

1573
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:31.855
This is what I am.

1574
01:32:34.258 --> 01:32:37.361
This is what I am. Ava.

1575
01:32:37.361 --> 01:32:40.330
You confess to me. you
tell me you have secrets.

1576
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:45.169
but I have blood on my hands
that no penance can cleanse.

1577
01:32:47.871 --> 01:32:49.239
You don't want me. Ava.

1578
01:32:51.842 --> 01:32:54.044
You don't want me.

1579
01:32:54.044 --> 01:32:55.712
I'm gonna burn in hell.

1580
01:33:03.153 --> 01:33:06.223
- Then I'll be there waiting for you.

1581
01:33:34.251 --> 01:33:35.085
Shit!
- Hey

1582
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:41.925
- May I have your attention please?

1583
01:33:41.925 --> 01:33:43.927
The final development phase

1584
01:33:43.927 --> 01:33:46.897
of the Vasiliev endeavor is complete.

1585
01:33:46.897 --> 01:33:51.201
Within a week. we will have
secured the last titles

1586
01:33:51.201 --> 01:33:55.772
to the holdout properties
in my town of Justamere.

1587
01:33:55.772 --> 01:33:59.776
Eye sores like this will
soon be a thing of the past.

1588
01:33:59.776 --> 01:34:02.946
Due in no small part to this week's merger

1589
01:34:02.946 --> 01:34:06.316
of Vasiliev Industries
and the Chicago firm

1590
01:34:06.316 --> 01:34:09.720
of Bartman/Amador Real
Estate Investments.

1591
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.991
In five years. we project
new residential sales

1592
01:34:13.991 --> 01:34:17.828
to top $200 million.

1593
01:34:17.828 --> 01:34:22.132
Ladies and gentlemen. the
future of the far south suburbs.

1594
01:34:22.132 --> 01:34:23.700
Thank you very much.

1595
01:34:34.578 --> 01:34:36.179
- Ashley?

1596
01:34:36.179 --> 01:34:39.016
- Hey. Father. did you catch my speech?

1597
01:34:39.016 --> 01:34:42.286
No. I guess you got other
things on your mind.

1598
01:34:42.286 --> 01:34:44.788
Oh. look at that.

1599
01:34:44.788 --> 01:34:47.324
That's gonna be viral tomorrow morning.

1600
01:34:48.458 --> 01:34:49.626
Oh. don't bother.

1601
01:34:49.626 --> 01:34:52.462
They've already been
sent to the church board.

1602
01:34:52.462 --> 01:34:53.931
Not ideal lighting.

1603
01:34:53.931 --> 01:34:58.001
but that's why I hired a professional.

1604
01:34:58.001 --> 01:34:59.570
her.

1605
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:00.771
- He hired you?

1606
01:35:01.838 --> 01:35:03.874
To seduce me?

1607
01:35:03.874 --> 01:35:05.742
- No. no. I couldn't go through with it.

1608
01:35:05.742 --> 01:35:08.645
That's the horrible thing
I told you I couldn't do.

1609
01:35:08.645 --> 01:35:11.415
- Oh. but you followed through anyway.

1610
01:35:11.415 --> 01:35:13.650
- I told him the deal was off

1611
01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:16.320
when I found out he had
Boris burn the church.

1612
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.289
- Oh. they're serving tenderloin.

1613
01:35:19.289 --> 01:35:20.157
Excuse me.

1614
01:35:20.157 --> 01:35:23.193
- You still will not get the church.

1615
01:35:23.193 --> 01:35:25.596
- If you think that board will defend you

1616
01:35:25.596 --> 01:35:27.397
after they get a load of you

1617
01:35:27.397 --> 01:35:30.834
and a dominatrix rutting like prom kids.

1618
01:35:30.834 --> 01:35:32.970
You're delusional. boy.

1619
01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:34.938
- She broke off the deal. I heard it.

1620
01:35:36.573 --> 01:35:38.175
- What are you gonna do?

1621
01:35:38.175 --> 01:35:39.443
Hit me?

1622
01:35:39.443 --> 01:35:41.244
Drive me into the ground like you did

1623
01:35:41.244 --> 01:35:44.348
that sorry excuse of a church?

1624
01:35:44.348 --> 01:35:45.782
If he does.

1625
01:35:45.782 --> 01:35:46.883
get photos.

1626
01:35:47.851 --> 01:35:50.554
You haven't paid rent in months.

1627
01:35:50.554 --> 01:35:53.957
You don't even have a pot to piss in.

1628
01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:55.292
Why do you think I came
to your little town

1629
01:35:55.292 --> 01:35:56.927
in the middle of nowhere. huh?

1630
01:35:57.561 --> 01:36:00.497
My Great Uncle Oto left
church to Justamere Trust.

1631
01:36:00.497 --> 01:36:02.566
I am sole beneficiary.

1632
01:36:02.566 --> 01:36:04.635
And I'm not selling.

1633
01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:09.339
- Where the hell did Boris go?

1634
01:36:10.173 --> 01:36:12.376
- I don't answer to you.

1635
01:36:15.412 --> 01:36:16.246
- Where is he?

1636
01:36:17.347 --> 01:36:19.750
- Dead woman walking.

1637
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:21.051
- That's right.

1638
01:36:21.051 --> 01:36:22.586
I got nothing to lose.

1639
01:36:37.601 --> 01:36:38.435
Gabe?

1640
01:36:41.638 --> 01:36:44.608
This is what you were so busy with?

1641
01:36:44.608 --> 01:36:47.077
You stole my best riding crop.

1642
01:36:47.077 --> 01:36:48.178
- Borrowed.

1643
01:36:49.246 --> 01:36:52.482
- What the fu--

1644
01:37:00.724 --> 01:37:03.527
- Erectile dysfunction. my ass!

1645
01:37:14.905 --> 01:37:16.406
- Radko Jovanovic.

1646
01:37:17.908 --> 01:37:20.110
Risen from mass grave.

1647
01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:21.545
- How much does she owe you?

1648
01:37:22.746 --> 01:37:23.714
- Her?

1649
01:37:23.714 --> 01:37:25.582
720.000

1650
01:37:25.582 --> 01:37:27.718
and 82 cents.

1651
01:37:28.752 --> 01:37:31.888
- If I fight for you. score is settled.

1652
01:37:32.756 --> 01:37:33.990
Debt is forgiven.

1653
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:35.992
She owes nothing.
- What?

1654
01:37:35.992 --> 01:37:36.993
- One match. that's it.

1655
01:37:36.993 --> 01:37:38.995
Just like you wanted for tournament.

1656
01:37:40.464 --> 01:37:41.932
- The tournament is tonight.

1657
01:37:41.932 --> 01:37:43.233
You go in ring tonight.

1658
01:37:44.634 --> 01:37:47.237
- After that. you will let us be.

1659
01:37:47.237 --> 01:37:49.806
No threats. no retribution.

1660
01:37:49.806 --> 01:37:52.709
I will win fight for you
tonight and tonight only.

1661
01:37:55.412 --> 01:37:58.482
- You are not going to win for me.

1662
01:37:58.482 --> 01:38:00.383
You are going to throw the fight.

1663
01:38:02.552 --> 01:38:04.221
- Excuse me. please.

1664
01:38:04.221 --> 01:38:06.123
I'm number 847.

1665
01:38:06.123 --> 01:38:08.325
The cobalt fur stole.

1666
01:38:08.325 --> 01:38:10.093
You know. cobalt. blue?

1667
01:38:10.093 --> 01:38:11.661
A little darker than azure.

1668
01:38:11.661 --> 01:38:13.797
Looks much more natural.

1669
01:38:13.797 --> 01:38:16.733
Two very different colors.

1670
01:38:16.733 --> 01:38:18.802
I can't stand it when you
order from the catalog

1671
01:38:18.802 --> 01:38:21.037
and they call the colors the wrong name.

1672
01:38:21.037 --> 01:38:22.439
Thank you. sweetheart.

1673
01:38:26.042 --> 01:38:27.644
- Shit.

1674
01:38:27.644 --> 01:38:29.813
You know. plenty of women
find out their best friend

1675
01:38:29.813 --> 01:38:32.415
is screwing their ex. but
this was not a scenario

1676
01:38:32.415 --> 01:38:34.251
I predicted for us. Gabriel.

1677
01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:36.286
- Oh. like you're a paragon of virtue!

1678
01:38:36.286 --> 01:38:38.622
You put semicolons in your texts.

1679
01:38:38.622 --> 01:38:39.489
Who does that?

1680
01:38:39.489 --> 01:38:41.825
A sociopath. that's who.

1681
01:38:41.825 --> 01:38:43.827
- You would know.

1682
01:38:43.827 --> 01:38:45.796
- Hello. Agent Washington

1683
01:38:45.796 --> 01:38:46.830
of the FBI.

1684
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:49.432
Keep your eyes on the road.

1685
01:38:49.432 --> 01:38:50.233
No. I'm here.

1686
01:38:50.233 --> 01:38:51.101
Yeah. yes. I'm with her.

1687
01:38:51.101 --> 01:38:53.503
We are trailing Vasiliev's
car heading north

1688
01:38:53.503 --> 01:38:55.238
towards the fight location.

1689
01:38:55.238 --> 01:38:56.540
No. we're not close
enough to see the plates.

1690
01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:57.908
Can you...

1691
01:38:57.908 --> 01:38:59.843
Okay. no. hold on. I can get the plate.

1692
01:39:00.844 --> 01:39:02.045
It's P

1693
01:39:02.045 --> 01:39:02.879
U

1694
01:39:02.879 --> 01:39:03.713
T

1695
01:39:03.713 --> 01:39:04.581
N

1696
01:39:04.581 --> 01:39:06.183
space L

1697
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:08.018
V R.

1698
01:39:08.018 --> 01:39:09.986
You've gotta be kidding me.

1699
01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:11.988
I'll be outside to flag you down.

1700
01:40:14.384 --> 01:40:15.218
- Radovan!

1701
01:40:33.703 --> 01:40:35.171
He's down!

1702
01:40:35.171 --> 01:40:36.139
Call the fight!

1703
01:40:36.139 --> 01:40:36.973
He's down!

1704
01:41:03.934 --> 01:41:04.801
Radovan!

1705
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:07.370
You have to stay down.

1706
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:08.905
It's nice but
he's still breathing.

1707
01:41:08.905 --> 01:41:10.440
I want him dead.

1708
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.142
I want to finish this.

1709
01:41:12.142 --> 01:41:13.143
Finish this.

1710
01:41:30.593 --> 01:41:32.128
- Feds!

1711
01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:33.763
It's a raid!

1712
01:41:33.763 --> 01:41:35.799
- No one can hear you. Ava.

1713
01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:37.000
They never have.

1714
01:41:38.501 --> 01:41:39.269
Ow!

1715
01:41:41.237 --> 01:41:43.573
It's a raid!

1716
01:42:05.395 --> 01:42:07.797
If I can't have him.
you sure as hell can't.

1717
01:42:07.797 --> 01:42:09.632
- I should have killed you with Solomon.

1718
01:42:09.632 --> 01:42:14.037
You are nothing but foolish. stupid bitch.

1719
01:42:14.037 --> 01:42:17.407
- I am not stupid.

1720
01:42:17.407 --> 01:42:19.576
I am not an object.

1721
01:42:19.576 --> 01:42:21.778
I am a genius.

1722
01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.554
Radovan.

1723
01:42:31.554 --> 01:42:32.389
Radovan.

1724
01:42:32.389 --> 01:42:33.757
Stay with me.

1725
01:42:33.757 --> 01:42:35.091
Stay with me.

1726
01:42:35.091 --> 01:42:35.925
Radovan.

1727
01:42:35.925 --> 01:42:37.327
Stay where you are.

1728
01:42:38.161 --> 01:42:38.995
Stay with me.

1729
01:42:40.363 --> 01:42:41.431
Stay with me.

1730
01:42:42.465 --> 01:42:43.633
Help's coming.

1731
01:42:58.314 --> 01:43:00.383
- Mama. what is going on?

1732
01:43:04.154 --> 01:43:05.588
What is this?

1733
01:43:06.856 --> 01:43:09.059
- Radko. We need to talk.

1734
01:43:16.099 --> 01:43:19.235
I lied to you about the insurance price.

1735
01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:20.437
It wasn't that high.

1736
01:43:21.805 --> 01:43:23.073
But don't worry.

1737
01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:26.042
I had Kurt invest in good Serbian stock.

1738
01:43:26.042 --> 01:43:28.078
- Majko. where are you going?

1739
01:43:28.078 --> 01:43:29.479
What are you doing?

1740
01:43:29.479 --> 01:43:33.083
- You have done right by
your majko for many years.

1741
01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:35.151
Now I do right by you.

1742
01:43:35.151 --> 01:43:37.020
I'm cutting the apron strings.

1743
01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.521
- What?

1744
01:43:38.521 --> 01:43:40.623
- I'm going home to Belgrade.

1745
01:43:40.623 --> 01:43:42.525
I want to be home when I die.

1746
01:43:42.525 --> 01:43:44.127
- Then I am coming with you.

1747
01:43:44.994 --> 01:43:46.062
- No. Radko.

1748
01:43:46.062 --> 01:43:48.698
You can't and I wouldn't want you to.

1749
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.369
This land is your home now.

1750
01:43:53.369 --> 01:43:55.305
Stay and live.

1751
01:43:57.907 --> 01:44:00.810
There's a special woman here for you.

1752
01:44:00.810 --> 01:44:03.179
The brave one I met. yes?

1753
01:44:03.179 --> 01:44:04.948
- It's complicated. majko.

1754
01:44:04.948 --> 01:44:07.283
She made it complicated.

1755
01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:08.418
- You're a strong man.

1756
01:44:08.418 --> 01:44:10.520
I raised you to be one.

1757
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:13.223
Life is short. make it uncomplicated.

1758
01:44:15.191 --> 01:44:16.993
- The painting is yours now.

1759
01:44:16.993 --> 01:44:18.695
Do with it as you wish.

1760
01:44:18.695 --> 01:44:19.996
- Mama. I can't accept it.

1761
01:44:19.996 --> 01:44:21.664
It's priceless.

1762
01:44:21.664 --> 01:44:25.768
- And it can be yours now
because you know it's true value.

1763
01:44:32.242 --> 01:44:33.176
Now go get laid.

1764
01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:35.912
I want grandbabies.

1765
01:44:35.912 --> 01:44:37.680
I'll haunt you till I get them.

1766
01:46:16.012 --> 01:46:17.947
I want you to have this.

1767
01:46:18.915 --> 01:46:21.017
I has belonged to my family for a century.

1768
01:46:22.051 --> 01:46:25.154
I want you to take it. write your thesis

1769
01:46:25.154 --> 01:46:27.123
and make all of your dreams come true.

1770
01:46:29.125 --> 01:46:31.761
Love. R.

1771
01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:35.598
P.S. You are so much more than enough.

1772
01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:36.933
You always have been.

1773
01:46:55.885 --> 01:46:57.353
Please leave a message.

1774
01:46:57.353 --> 01:46:58.988
- I just found it.

1775
01:47:01.357 --> 01:47:03.660
It's the greatest gift
anyone's ever given me.

1776
01:47:07.196 --> 01:47:08.831
No. that's not true.

1777
01:47:11.701 --> 01:47:15.204
It's the greatest gift anyone's given me

1778
01:47:15.204 --> 01:47:17.473
that price tag could be put on.

1779
01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:23.813
I'm so sorry for what I did.

1780
01:47:23.813 --> 01:47:25.315
For the position I put you in.

1781
01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:28.685
I'm sorry for everything.

1782
01:47:31.354 --> 01:47:34.457
I had no idea how I would
come to feel for you.

1783
01:47:35.925 --> 01:47:38.061
I wish I could fix it all.

1784
01:47:38.061 --> 01:47:40.396
I wish I could set it right.

1785
01:48:11.294 --> 01:48:12.595
Hi.

1786
01:48:12.595 --> 01:48:13.429
- Hi.

1787
01:48:18.368 --> 01:48:19.702
- I thought I'd never see you again--

1788
01:48:32.415 --> 01:48:33.816
- You owe me a dance.

1789
01:48:46.429 --> 01:48:49.832
So. you didn't really throw the catsuit

1790
01:48:49.832 --> 01:48:51.401
in the lake. did you?

1791
01:48:53.035 --> 01:48:54.170
- Why?

1792
01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:55.004
Did you like it?

1793
01:48:56.672 --> 01:48:59.242
- Last time I checked. I'm still a man.

1794
01:49:01.043 --> 01:49:04.313
- Sounds like somebody

That is a priceless work of art worth

1803
01:49:57.567 --> 01:49:59.235
more than 30 of your churches.

what my line is. I'm sorry.
