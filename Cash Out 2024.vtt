00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:13.888
Unfortunately.

710
00:32:13.975 --> 00:32:15.455
Okay. do a background check on--

711
00:32:15.542 --> 00:32:17.500
- what the fuck was her name?
- Isabelle Pharaoh.

712
00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:20.112
Isabelle Pharaoh.
Do the whole gamut.

713
00:32:20.199 --> 00:32:22.723
I just. I don't understand.
It's gotta be in here.

714
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.508
[sighs] Shawn. it's a decoy box.

715
00:32:25.595 --> 00:32:29.077
[intense music continues]

716
00:32:29.164 --> 00:32:31.862
[phone ringing]

717
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.953
- Bank robbers are us.
- [Amy] <i>Hey. Link.</i>

718
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:39.566
- Amy. is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

719
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:41.133
[Link] <i>Oh. my God.
it's been forever!</i>

720
00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.005
Yeah. I know. right?
How are you?

721
00:32:44.092 --> 00:32:47.356
I've been okay.
How about you. still jogging?

722
00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:49.358
No. I pulled my hip
out a couple weeks back

723
00:32:49.445 --> 00:32:50.403
doing some fieldwork.

724
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.275
Ugh. hate when that happens.

725
00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:54.798
On point for this one?

726
00:32:55.582 --> 00:32:56.670
Sure am.

727
00:32:59.368 --> 00:33:01.718
It just doesn't seem like Mason.

728
00:33:01.805 --> 00:33:04.199
[indistinct chatter]

729
00:33:04.286 --> 00:33:05.331
Shawn?

730
00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:09.291
Can I talk to Mason?

731
00:33:09.378 --> 00:33:12.599
[Link] <i>Sure. no problem.
One sec.</i>

732
00:33:12.686 --> 00:33:15.254
[phone beeps]

733
00:33:16.907 --> 00:33:19.127
[Link exhales]

734
00:33:19.214 --> 00:33:21.521
- Uh. Chief?
- [Mason] <i>Yeah?</i>

735
00:33:21.608 --> 00:33:23.827
I got the negotiator
on the line.

736
00:33:23.914 --> 00:33:26.308
Okay. I have to go.

737
00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:28.006
If he moves. you shoot him.

738
00:33:32.749 --> 00:33:35.143
[sirens blaring]

739
00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:40.409
[footsteps tapping]

740
00:33:40.496 --> 00:33:42.150
You should probably be
sitting down for this.

741
00:33:42.237 --> 00:33:43.673
- Oh. yeah?
- [Link] Yeah.

742
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:48.374
[chair rattles]

743
00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:50.028
- [phone beeps]
- Go ahead.

744
00:33:51.116 --> 00:33:52.204
[Amy] <i>Hi. Mason.</i>

745
00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:57.383
[bright music]

746
00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:02.562
- Amy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

747
00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:04.433
How are you?

748
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.480
Doing pretty good.
you know. considering.

749
00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:09.438
[bright music continues]

750
00:34:09.525 --> 00:34:11.266
No. that's a lie.

751
00:34:11.353 --> 00:34:14.095
It's. it's. you know.
pretty crappy to be honest.

752
00:34:14.182 --> 00:34:16.880
But now that I hear
your voice not. not bad.

753
00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:20.145
- Y-you sound really good.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

754
00:34:20.232 --> 00:34:23.104
I-- I've been busting my
ass with this fieldwork.

755
00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:25.454
Oh. yeah?
How's that going?

756
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:28.414
Good. they promoted me
to the special unit.

757
00:34:28.501 --> 00:34:30.546
<i>Really? Well. that's good.</i>

758
00:34:30.633 --> 00:34:34.333
I'm happy for you.
Couldn't happen
to a better person.

759
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.206
So. uh. I gotta ask.
FBI throwing this party?

760
00:34:38.293 --> 00:34:40.078
Yeah. you're not wrong.

761
00:34:40.165 --> 00:34:42.819
Of course they got you.
Cars were here quick. huh?

762
00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:44.517
You had a head start.

763
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:45.431
[Amy] <i>Yeah. we picked up
on the white chatter</i>

764
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:47.085
<i>a couple weeks back.</i>

765
00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:50.610
Oh. of course. Shawn.
Sloppy.

766
00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:51.611
[Amy] <i>I. I'm sure
he was just trying</i>

767
00:34:51.698 --> 00:34:54.527
<i>to help you in his own way.</i>

768
00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:59.662
Hey. Amy. I'm.
I'm happy it's you.

769
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:01.534
Uh. I couldn't help but notice

770
00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:03.579
that your inside
surveillance is dark.

771
00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:04.928
<i>Link did an excellent
job controlling</i>

772
00:35:05.015 --> 00:35:06.452
<i>the seats on your perimeter.</i>

773
00:35:06.539 --> 00:35:09.846
Well. she's the best. isn't she?

774
00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:13.720
Um. I guess we should
get down to business.

775
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:15.374
[Mason] <i>Well. okay.</i>

776
00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:17.811
All right. so this is
the part where you say

777
00:35:17.898 --> 00:35:19.204
<i>that. uh. you've got
everything covered.</i>

778
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:21.380
The entrance. the exits.
you've got tactical.

779
00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:24.209
you've got snipers. you've
got electronic surveillance.

780
00:35:24.296 --> 00:35:28.126
And I in turn tell you that
I've got a bunch of hostages.

781
00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:29.301
and I don't wanna hurt them.

782
00:35:29.388 --> 00:35:30.911
But. you know. if you bust in.

783
00:35:30.998 --> 00:35:32.652
I gotta do blah.
blah. blah. blah. blah

784
00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:35.524
to each and every one
of them. and what's new?

785
00:35:35.611 --> 00:35:37.744
How many hostages?

786
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:40.703
[Mason] <i>Twenty-three. if you
include staff and security.</i>

787
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.315
Okay. well. if Anton
is on crowd control.

788
00:35:43.402 --> 00:35:45.578
<i>I'm sure they're in good hands.</i>

789
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:49.234
Okay. so. uh. I have
a special request.

790
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.933
[Amy] <i>Okay. shoot.
I'll do my best.</i>

791
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.109
I need 50 feet.

792
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:57.459
- 50 feet?
- 50 feet.

793
00:35:57.546 --> 00:35:59.026
Why 50 feet?

794
00:35:59.113 --> 00:36:01.028
I mean. that's new.

795
00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:02.725
Oh. I don't know. Amy.

796
00:36:02.812 --> 00:36:05.250
I guess I'm feeling
kind of claustrophobic.

797
00:36:05.337 --> 00:36:07.252
<i>Sides. front of the
building. everyone back.</i>

798
00:36:07.339 --> 00:36:10.516
<i>cops. tacticals. everyone.</i>

799
00:36:10.603 --> 00:36:12.648
<i>Oh. and include the sidewalk.</i>

800
00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:16.478
- [dramatic music]
- [sirens blaring]

801
00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:18.611
<i>You know how I get
when I'm in a corner.</i>

802
00:36:18.698 --> 00:36:20.482
[Link] <i>What do you
think she's doing?</i>

803
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:24.138
[chuckles] She's trying
to figure out 50 feet.

804
00:36:24.225 --> 00:36:26.314
[dramatic music continues]

805
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:28.316
[Link] <i>She doesn't look that
comfortable in that suit.</i>

806
00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:30.144
<i>It's not her.</i>

807
00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:32.929
[Mason] <i>Nah. it's not bad.
I kinda like it.</i>

808
00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:34.192
Oh. she looks good.

809
00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:37.020
Oh. she looks great.

810
00:36:37.107 --> 00:36:41.199
And she's got that little
confidence bump in her voice.

811
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:43.375
Like when she beats you at pool?

812
00:36:43.462 --> 00:36:45.420
No. she never beat me a pool.

813
00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:49.685
But [sighs] she's really doing
well for herself. isn't she?

814
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.515
[chuckles] Wow.

815
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:55.822
[dramatic music continues]

816
00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:59.304
Captain. I'm gonna need a
360 sweep of the perimeter.

817
00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:01.001
All right.
I'll let you negotiate.

818
00:37:01.088 --> 00:37:04.047
but I'm still in charge
of this operation.

819
00:37:04.134 --> 00:37:05.527
And I will let you
keep that narrative

820
00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:07.225
as long as you do what I say.

821
00:37:07.312 --> 00:37:11.751
[indistinct radio chatter]

822
00:37:11.838 --> 00:37:14.319
[suspenseful music]

823
00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:17.539
Sniper 3 in position. 52 feet.

824
00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:21.674
[suspenseful music continues]

825
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.247
[clears throat] So nothing
in the 50-foot range.

826
00:37:29.334 --> 00:37:31.336
Not nothing.

827
00:37:31.423 --> 00:37:32.859
There's gotta be something or
he wouldn't have asked for it.

828
00:37:32.946 --> 00:37:34.643
All right. there's a
protocol that we follow here.

829
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.602
trade-offs. escalation.
sweat equity.

830
00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:38.125
We make one hour feel like 10.

831
00:37:38.212 --> 00:37:39.735
Then when the sun drops.
we drill hard.

832
00:37:39.822 --> 00:37:43.304
I am aware of the
protocol and so is he.

833
00:37:43.391 --> 00:37:45.263
If you don't think that Mason
is one step ahead of us.

834
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:46.612
you're a fool.

835
00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:48.527
<i>Mason is a wolf.</i>

836
00:37:48.614 --> 00:37:52.008
<i>He will chew his leg off
to get out of a trap.</i>

837
00:37:52.095 --> 00:37:54.489
Yeah. you and him are
pretty intimate. yeah?

838
00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:56.143
How do I know you're
not helping him?

839
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.536
Why should I trust you?

840
00:37:57.623 --> 00:38:00.539
It is not important
if you trust me.

841
00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:03.063
It's important that
you're superiors do.

842
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.499
Turn that up. please.

843
00:38:06.632 --> 00:38:08.547
<i>I've exclusively
learned the identity</i>

844
00:38:08.634 --> 00:38:10.940
<i>of one of the
alleged bank robbers.</i>

845
00:38:11.027 --> 00:38:13.726
<i>and it's none other than
Mason Andrew Goddard.</i>

846
00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:15.641
<i>My sources confirm
he is the notorious</i>

847
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:19.253
<i>international criminal.
the Ace of Spades.</i>

848
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.169
Okay. we got black
coffee with ice.

849
00:38:22.256 --> 00:38:24.040
Would you like a. uh.
creamer with that?

850
00:38:24.127 --> 00:38:25.694
We got hazelnut.
We've got vanilla.

851
00:38:25.781 --> 00:38:27.696
Ugh. gross.
That's a joke. right?

852
00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:30.177
What's happening?

853
00:38:30.264 --> 00:38:31.918
The tactical team looks serious.

854
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:35.487
- Oh. yeah.
- You're not worried?

855
00:38:35.574 --> 00:38:38.359
Nah. that's what
she wants us to be.

856
00:38:38.446 --> 00:38:41.841
worried so we make a
mistake and slip up.

857
00:38:41.928 --> 00:38:45.975
Okay. If there's a decoy box.
there's a hidden account.

858
00:38:46.062 --> 00:38:47.760
I need you to find it.

859
00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:49.414
And what we should
be doing is looking

860
00:38:49.501 --> 00:38:50.937
for our escape route.

861
00:38:51.024 --> 00:38:53.853
No. no. no. That's
what she wants. okay?

862
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.942
We just have to keep
one step ahead of her.

863
00:38:57.509 --> 00:39:00.555
[radio crackling]

864
00:39:00.642 --> 00:39:02.340
Yeah. yeah.
Okay. I'll be right there.

865
00:39:02.427 --> 00:39:04.298
Now listen.
don't overthink this.

866
00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:06.431
Okay? I'll buy you as
much time as you need.

[suspenseful music]

868
00:39:09.216 --> 00:39:11.740
Whoo!

869
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:14.439
[Anton] That's it.
Everybody on me. on me.

870
00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:15.744
[suspenseful music continues]

871
00:39:15.831 --> 00:39:17.833
Look down. Stay to the
right of that wall.

872
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.140
[Hector] Let's pick
up the pace. people!

873
00:39:20.227 --> 00:39:21.968
Come on. Let's move!

874
00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:24.449
Let's go!

875
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:26.451
Face down.
Don't look at me. man.

876
00:39:26.538 --> 00:39:28.017
[Hector] Keep your eyes forward!

[footsteps stomping]

878
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.375
Yeah. we're clear here.

879
00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:43.424
[suspenseful music continues]

880
00:39:45.339 --> 00:39:47.210
[Anton] Everybody
get comfortable.

881
00:39:47.297 --> 00:39:50.388
We gonna figure out some
food and drinks in a minute.

882
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:52.868
Get to know each other. relax.

883
00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:55.262
Consider this a vacation
from your busy lives. folks.

884
00:39:57.699 --> 00:40:00.049
- What do you need?
- Food and drinks.

885
00:40:00.136 --> 00:40:01.834
All right.

886
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:03.966
Me and Hector got this
whole room under control.

887
00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:06.491
- Ain't that right. Hec?
- Yes. sir!

888
00:40:06.578 --> 00:40:08.362
[suspenseful music continues]

889
00:40:08.449 --> 00:40:11.060
All right. just so you know.
there is a plan.

890
00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:12.497
You the boss.

891
00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:15.064
[suspenseful music continues]

892
00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:17.066
[birds chirping]

893
00:40:17.153 --> 00:40:18.459
Are you sure we can't
find something visual?

894
00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:21.027
Just maybe an old security
camera in the lobby?

895
00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:22.463
I mean. anything.

896
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.769
She locked it all down tight.

897
00:40:23.856 --> 00:40:26.336
Landlines. feeds. everything.
She's a pro.

898
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:27.599
Yeah. I know.

899
00:40:27.686 --> 00:40:29.862
Mossad outsourced her.

900
00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:30.950
All right.

901
00:40:31.037 --> 00:40:33.866
There's 23 hostages.

902
00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:36.956
All of them were smart devices.

903
00:40:37.043 --> 00:40:39.480
But you know. Anton didn't
let them keep any of them on.

904
00:40:40.655 --> 00:40:42.962
But a tech with your skills

905
00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:45.660
could probably turn
one back on remotely.

906
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:48.184
Yes?

907
00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:51.013
Uh. okay.

908
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.755
Got something here.
One second.

909
00:40:53.842 --> 00:40:56.279
[gentle music]

910
00:40:56.366 --> 00:40:58.586
Wait. is that spa music?

911
00:40:59.892 --> 00:41:01.241
Wow.

912
00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:03.765
[gentle music]

913
00:41:03.852 --> 00:41:04.766
Brilliant.

914
00:41:04.853 --> 00:41:07.334
[gentle music]

915
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:09.205
[zipper rasps]

916
00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:11.164
[telephone ringing]

917
00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:12.513
Command trailer.

918
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:15.690
It's for you.

919
00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:18.563
[button beeping]

920
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.695
That spa music was a nice touch.

921
00:41:20.782 --> 00:41:23.524
So you can remotely control
someone's personal device.

922
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:24.699
<i>Isn't that illegal. Amy?</i>

923
00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:26.919
It's a gray area.

924
00:41:27.006 --> 00:41:29.965
Hmm. Can't help but
notice the buildup.

925
00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:32.011
[Amy] <i>Yeah. the
troops are getting antsy.</i>

926
00:41:32.098 --> 00:41:34.317
Hmm. Yeah. well. we're
antsy in here. too.

927
00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:37.582
Okay. I got a request for you.

928
00:41:37.669 --> 00:41:39.627
That's not fair.
I gave you 50 feet.

929
00:41:39.714 --> 00:41:40.628
you haven't
given me anything.

930
00:41:40.715 --> 00:41:42.543
Nobody's hurt. that's fair.

931
00:41:43.762 --> 00:41:45.024
What do you want?

932
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:48.462
I want two dozen pizzas.
A mixed variety.

933
00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:50.333
And a Hawaiian for Shawn.

934
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.554
And then for drinks.
let's just do a mix of sodas.

935
00:41:53.641 --> 00:41:58.603
some water. maybe an
apple juice for the kid.

936
00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.474
and beer for me.

937
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:01.867
<i>In under 30 minutes.</i>

938
00:42:01.954 --> 00:42:04.391
- Anything else?
- Yes.

939
00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:09.048
I want you to deliver it.
Alone.

940
00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:10.049
On the steps.

941
00:42:10.136 --> 00:42:12.355
Timer started.

942
00:42:12.442 --> 00:42:14.227
And don't forget the beer.

943
00:42:14.314 --> 00:42:17.360
Beer? Don't you think that's
a little premature?

944
00:42:17.447 --> 00:42:18.840
Have some faith in me. will you?

945
00:42:18.927 --> 00:42:20.755
And I'll see you in
under 30 minutes.

946
00:42:21.843 --> 00:42:24.585
[upbeat music]

947
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.684
- [finger snapping]
- [upbeat music]

948
00:42:39.687 --> 00:42:41.733
- Hey. Shawn.
- [Shawn] <i>Yeah?</i>

949
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.213
Check the decoy box. would you?

950
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.781
Look through all the
personal things. like rings.

951
00:42:46.868 --> 00:42:48.174
lockets. whatever.

952
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:49.392
Just give me any
numbers you find.

953
00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:51.177
Like. any numbers at all.

954
00:42:51.264 --> 00:42:54.354
[upbeat music]

955
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:57.096
[lid thuds]

956
00:42:57.183 --> 00:42:59.968
[Shawn] You knew this was
a decoy box. didn't you?

957
00:43:00.055 --> 00:43:02.057
We got thousands of customers.

958
00:43:02.144 --> 00:43:03.885
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

959
00:43:03.972 --> 00:43:04.843
[Shawn] Yeah. right.

960
00:43:10.413 --> 00:43:13.895
I sense a little tension
between you and your brother.

961
00:43:13.982 --> 00:43:15.027
How do you know he's my brother?

962
00:43:15.114 --> 00:43:17.029
Hey. step back.

963
00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:19.509
- Get back.
- I guessed.

964
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.903
You confirmed it.

965
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:23.122
You know. I got an
older brother. too.

966
00:43:23.209 --> 00:43:25.515
Bossy.

967
00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:27.909
I simply detest the holiday
get-togethers. because of it.

968
00:43:27.996 --> 00:43:29.781
Yeah. no matter
what I say or do.

969
00:43:29.868 --> 00:43:31.260
he's always got a one-up me.

970
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.654
Yeah. Mason's not like that.

971
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:38.093
Treats you like a child.

972
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.965
I mean. this was supposed
to be your big score.

973
00:43:40.052 --> 00:43:41.619
Now look. you're
relegated to holding

974
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:43.751
the bank manager hostage.

975
00:43:43.838 --> 00:43:46.058
I fucked up. I deserve it.

976
00:43:46.145 --> 00:43:48.713
Well. is that what
he makes you think?

977
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.237
Enough! You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

978
00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:52.717
all right. bro?

979
00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:53.892
Step the fuck back.

980
00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.374
Hey. Link?

981
00:43:58.461 --> 00:44:00.594
[Link] <i>Have anything yet?</i>

982
00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:02.378
I think I found your number.

983
00:44:02.465 --> 00:44:03.771
[suspenseful music]

984
00:44:03.858 --> 00:44:07.079
About 24 hostages at this time.

985
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:10.691
and we're still waiting
for the initial hostages

986
00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:12.606
to be released.
but at this point.

987
00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:14.652
we don't know how
long it's gonna take.

988
00:44:14.739 --> 00:44:17.132
[upbeat music]

989
00:44:19.613 --> 00:44:22.268
Oop. Here she comes.

990
00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:27.055
- [gentle upbeat music]
- [birds chirping]

991
00:44:40.939 --> 00:44:43.506
[gentle upbeat music]

992
00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.124
- [Amy exhales sharply]
- [gentle upbeat music]

993
00:44:55.997 --> 00:44:56.955
Hi there.

994
00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.305
Hi.

995
00:45:02.874 --> 00:45:06.704
I'd invite you in. but uh.
a lot of people watching.

996
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:09.489
There's that. yeah.

997
00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:13.493
Uh. how many crosshairs
am I in right now?

998
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.626
Uh. I'd say about 12.

999
00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:18.672
Hmm. big turnout.

1000
00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:19.717
- I know. right?
- Yeah.

1001
00:45:19.804 --> 00:45:22.328
You're a popular guy.

1002
00:45:22.415 --> 00:45:23.721
Hey. I'm sorry about turning you

1003
00:45:23.808 --> 00:45:25.548
into the pizza delivery girl.

1004
00:45:25.635 --> 00:45:30.118
but it's the only way
I could do a face-to-face.

1005
00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:33.165
you know. just you
and me and of course.

1006
00:45:33.252 --> 00:45:35.167
everybody else. but...

1007
00:45:35.254 --> 00:45:39.562
So. um. I'm gonna
need two hostages.

1008
00:45:39.649 --> 00:45:41.260
non-negotiable. give to get.

1009
00:45:41.347 --> 00:45:43.218
Okay.

1010
00:45:43.305 --> 00:45:45.394
And then after that.
two every hour.

1011
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:46.656
All right. fine.

1012
00:45:47.919 --> 00:45:50.312
You're not even gonna counter?

1013
00:45:50.399 --> 00:45:52.358
Why? It's a good. fair deal.

1014
00:45:53.533 --> 00:45:55.883
You working out?

1015
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:59.539
Uh. uh. I mean. a. a little bit.

1016
00:45:59.626 --> 00:46:01.323
I-- I think it's
just the fieldwork.

1017
00:46:03.586 --> 00:46:05.719
You know what would be cool?

1018
00:46:05.806 --> 00:46:08.940
If. um. after all this is over.

1019
00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:12.247
we went to our
private little island

1020
00:46:12.334 --> 00:46:15.990
and you know. the one with the
fishing dock and the garden?

1021
00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:23.519
I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

1022
00:46:23.606 --> 00:46:26.174
No. you don't have
to worry about that.

1023
00:46:26.261 --> 00:46:28.655
But this isn't gonna end well.

1024
00:46:28.742 --> 00:46:31.397
Well. maybe. maybe not.

1025
00:46:31.484 --> 00:46:33.442
Look. at some point. the
gloves are gonna come off.

1026
00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:35.444
and people are gonna get hurt.

1027
00:46:35.531 --> 00:46:37.577
Okay. well. first of
all. I did not plan this.

1028
00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:38.970
This is Shawn. okay?

1029
00:46:39.057 --> 00:46:40.928
And I'm just here
to bail him out.

1030
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:42.190
After what happened with us.

1031
00:46:42.277 --> 00:46:44.932
I-- I retired. just so you know.

1032
00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:48.022
So just turn yourself in now.

1033
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:49.894
I can't do that.
We'd all go to prison.

1034
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:52.418
Well. it beats dying in
a hailstorm of bullets.

1035
00:46:52.505 --> 00:46:53.636
I know about that.

1036
00:46:53.723 --> 00:46:55.247
My dad died in prison.

1037
00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.640
I think he would've
chosen the hailstorm.

1038
00:46:58.859 --> 00:47:00.687
I need my two hostages.

1039
00:47:02.645 --> 00:47:04.517
And I need my pizza.

All right. pizzas. pizza. man.
Let's go.

1043
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.625
Cold or hot. eat it.

1044
00:47:25.712 --> 00:47:27.540
Just put it in your damn
stomach and shut up.

00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:18.765
So. I threw 2-1-3-4
into the algorithm.

1055
00:48:18.852 --> 00:48:20.332
and you're never
gonna believe this.

1056
00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:21.855
[laughs] Oh. you gotta match.

1057
00:48:21.942 --> 00:48:23.726
Yes. to Isabelle Pharoah.

1058

Of course. it's dark.

1059
00:48:27.078 --> 00:48:28.427
but you know. without the
number. you won't find the name.

1060
00:48:28.514 --> 00:48:30.342
- Yeah. yeah. this is good.
- Yeah.

1061
00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:31.865
Shawn. this is good.

1062
00:48:31.952 --> 00:48:34.781
Just. just find the box 2-1-3-4.

1063
00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:37.349
[Shawn] <i>I'm telling you.
there is no 2-1-3-4 here.</i>

Okay. you know what?

1066
00:48:42.006 --> 00:48:43.355
I-- I think it's time for me

1067
00:48:43.442 --> 00:48:45.139
to have a little talk
with Mr. Manager.

1068
00:48:45.226 --> 00:48:47.228

What the fuck's going on?

1077
00:49:24.222 --> 00:49:25.701
Where did he go?

1078
00:49:25.788 --> 00:49:27.268
He bolted.

1079
00:49:27.355 --> 00:49:31.403

It's not a box.

1118

Very few people know that
the building next door

1119
00:52:54.345 --> 00:52:55.737
is part of the bank.

1120
00:52:55.824 --> 00:52:58.523
It's for our special accounts.

1121
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.046
It's location is a secret

1122
00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:01.830
even to the account
holders themselves.

1123
00:53:01.917 --> 00:53:04.442
so they can't be blackmailed.

1124
00:53:04.529 --> 00:53:06.748
Okay. so how do
we get over there?

1125

You walk down the sidewalk.

1126
00:53:08.707 --> 00:53:11.362
Okay.

1127
00:53:11.449 --> 00:53:13.364
You're gonna find another
way for us to get there.

1128
00:53:15.017 --> 00:53:17.455
Please. I'm begging you.

1129
00:53:17.542 --> 00:53:18.760
Abandon this now
while you still can.

1130
00:53:18.847 --> 00:53:21.763
I-- I got a family.

We-- we don't want to hurt you.

1132
00:53:23.852 --> 00:53:26.072
All we want is this
woman's crypto account.

1134
00:53:27.639 --> 00:53:29.771
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

1135

When he finds out
what's happening.

1136
00:53:31.904 --> 00:53:33.601
he's gonna kill everybody
in this building

1137
00:53:33.688 --> 00:53:34.863
to protect that account.

1138
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.300
Who?

1139
00:53:37.605 --> 00:53:39.520
Abel Salazar.

1143

funded all those coups.

1144
00:53:47.659 --> 00:53:48.964

1145
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:50.792
Yeah.

1146
00:53:50.879 --> 00:53:53.447
And his mistress
is Isabelle Pharoah.

[suspenseful music]

1148
00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:03.631
- We're dead.
- [Shawn] I'm not following.

1149
00:54:03.718 --> 00:54:05.633
It's a dirt box.

1150
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.592
It's-- it's-- it's the most
powerful people in the world

1151
00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:10.203
have their dirty little
secrets in there.

1152
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.813
And I'm telling you.

1153
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.294
it's the most serious
leverage imaginable.

1154
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.863
How do you know there's
real dirt in there?

1155
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:20.648
Because nobody bothers
to go to this level

1156
00:54:20.735 --> 00:54:23.521
of hiding things unless
it's all fucked up.

1157
00:54:23.608 --> 00:54:27.089
And that-that decoy
with the mistress.

1158
00:54:27.176 --> 00:54:28.700
I don't know why the fuck
they trusted this guy with it.

1159
00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:30.615
for God's sakes.
And look at this.

1160
00:54:30.702 --> 00:54:33.705
Our fan base is big.
but not that big.

1161
00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:38.492
Oh. man.
If. if I'm wrong. we're dead.

1162
00:54:38.579 --> 00:54:41.713
And if I'm right.
we call the shots.

1163
00:54:43.018 --> 00:54:44.672
And we get the crypto.

1164
00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:46.500
[Link] We're gonna
need the schematics.

1165
00:54:46.587 --> 00:54:47.762

You have the schematics.

1166
00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:49.590

I'd like to speak with you.

1177
00:55:36.637 --> 00:55:38.204

1179
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.557
I'll be back.

1180
00:55:45.342 --> 00:55:46.952
Remind me again.
You are?

1181

Mr. Flowers.

1182
00:55:50.477 --> 00:55:51.783
My client has a
personal interest

1183
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.525
in this particular
establishment and uh. well.

1184
00:55:54.612 --> 00:55:56.788

Who's your client?

1186
00:55:58.746 --> 00:56:00.835
Your superior knows who he is.

1187
00:56:00.922 --> 00:56:02.794
Well. there's no
need to be concerned.

1188
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:04.752
I have everything under control.

1189
00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:08.016
Is there some reason you haven't
breached the building yet?

1190
00:56:08.103 --> 00:56:10.802
Yeah. they've been returning
hostages on schedule.

1191
00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:13.326
No one's been hurt.
I have no reason to.

1192
00:56:13.413 --> 00:56:16.024
My client's only concern is
the security of his property.

1193
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:18.766
No one is getting
out of that building

1194

1195

Perhaps you don't get
my gist. Agent Decker.

1196
00:56:23.467 --> 00:56:25.207
Secure this establishment now

1197
00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:27.775
or there will be an avalanche.

1198
00:56:27.862 --> 00:56:31.257

Okay. it's plastic.
What do you got?

- It's drywall. I got my mallet.
- Good.

brought my equipment now. huh?

I'm very. very proud of you now.
Now. let's go.

- Okay. stand back.
- Okay.

00:57:45.113 --> 00:57:46.680
- [bag thuds]
- You're next.

1224
00:57:46.767 --> 00:57:49.335
- Come on.
- Yeah. coming. [grunts]

1225
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.473
Shit.

1226
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.648
It's a fucking brick wall.

1227
00:57:57.735 --> 00:58:00.564
Link. what do we do with this?

1228
00:58:00.651 --> 00:58:02.609
[Anton] <i>Yo. boss.
it's time for the hostages.</i>

1229
00:58:06.439 --> 00:58:08.702
Shawn. get your gun out.

1230
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:10.922
You get in the corner.
Right now.

1231
00:58:11.009 --> 00:58:12.924
Now listen. he moves.
you fucking shoot him.

1232
00:58:13.011 --> 00:58:14.360
- Okay?
- Yeah. okay.

1233
00:58:14.447 --> 00:58:16.449
I'm not kidding.
I'll be right back.

1234
00:58:16.536 --> 00:58:18.190
Hostage coming out!

1235
00:58:18.277 --> 00:58:19.408
Go ahead. Go.

1236
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:20.714
Go.

1237
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:23.543
[door thuds]

1238
00:58:25.066 --> 00:58:26.590
Anton.

1239
00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:27.634
- Yeah. Chief.
- I need two more.

1240
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:29.288
Who are the medication people?

1241
00:58:30.332 --> 00:58:31.377
You. come. Now.

1242
00:58:31.464 --> 00:58:32.900
Let's go. let's go.

1243
00:58:32.987 --> 00:58:34.728
- Yo. get up. get up. get up.
- Come on.

1244
00:58:34.815 --> 00:58:36.295
Quick. quick.

1245
00:58:40.168 --> 00:58:41.605
Okay. who's next on the list?

1246
00:58:41.692 --> 00:58:43.868
Two college girls
with the final exams.

1247
00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:45.130
[Mason] Okay. bring
'em. bring 'em.

1248
00:58:45.217 --> 00:58:45.957
- Get 'em.
- Let's go. Come on.

1249
00:58:48.612 --> 00:58:49.656
Quicker. move.

[suspenseful music]

1251
00:58:55.227 --> 00:58:57.055
- Two more coming out!
- [Officer] Hold your fire.

1252
00:58:57.142 --> 00:58:58.273
Two more coming out.

1253
00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.363
[suspenseful music]

1254
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.322
Through this way.
Let's go. let's go.

1255
00:59:03.409 --> 00:59:05.542
DRD in position.
Get 'em over to medical.

1256
00:59:05.629 --> 00:59:06.891
Eyes on the engine.
Coming through.

[suspenseful music]

1259
00:59:23.603 --> 00:59:24.561
Okay.

1260
00:59:24.648 --> 00:59:27.172
[Shawn panting]

1261
00:59:30.828 --> 00:59:35.572
- [hammer thudding]
- [cement crashing]

[suspenseful music]

1263
00:59:46.757 --> 00:59:49.586
- [Mason] Let's go.
- Okay. I'm going. I'm going.

1264
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:53.372
[men panting]

1265
00:59:58.116 --> 00:59:58.986
Ah.

1266
01:00:00.031 --> 01:00:00.858
Ah.

1267
01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:03.251
Woo.

1268
01:00:03.338 --> 01:00:06.994
[suspenseful music]

1269
01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:11.259
Look. you gotta
tell me something.

1270
01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:13.653
Who else have you ever
talked to about this?

1271
01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:18.353
<i>Who told you about this job?</i>

1272
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.052
You remember my
friend Al from L.A.?

1273
01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:23.576
He's a good guy.
You met him before.

1274
01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:27.624
Yeah. Al's the one who was in
San Quentin for 10 years. yes?

1275
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.714
Yeah. hey. he must have got out.

1276
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:32.716
Why are you interrogating
me about this?

1277
01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:36.415
[Mason] <i>Oh. God. I gotta
make a call. keep digging.</i>

1278
01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:38.722
- [college girl]
Hey. are you Decker?
- Yeah.

1279
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:39.592
Um. he asked me to
give this to you.

1280
01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.333
He-- he said it was plan B.

1281
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.856
Thank you.

1282
01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:47.382
- [cell phone ringing]
- Hey.

1283
01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:50.734
Amy. I knew you were ruthless.
but not this ruthless.

1284
01:00:50.821 --> 01:00:52.257
What are you talking about?

1285
01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:54.520
<i>You used Al to
get to my brother.</i>

1286
01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:55.913
Al?

1287
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.479
Yes. you got him
outta prison early.

1288
01:00:57.566 --> 01:00:59.438
Then he talked my
brother into this gig.

1289
01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:01.396
[Amy] <i>That is not
what's happening.</i>

1290
01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:04.225
Then why this box?
Amy. this box.

1291
01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:05.400
<i>You want to get us all killed?</i>

1292
01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:07.925
No. of course not.

1293
01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:10.754
Mason. I've been honest
with you this entire time.

1294
01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:12.625
Oh. really. how about Miami?

1295
01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:14.583
Was it. was that real?

1296
01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.455
Yes. I mean. most of it.

1297
01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:18.979
Obviously not the job part.
but the rest of it. yes.

1298
01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:20.720
[Mason] <i>And how about now?</i>

1299
01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:23.114
[sighs] Mason. I swear to you.

1300
01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:26.117
I don't know anything
about this box.

1301
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:27.988
[Mason] <i>Oh. you don't know that.</i>

1302
01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:29.773
that this was Salazar's
mistress' box?

1303
01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.209
You didn't know that?

1304
01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:32.993
[suspenseful music]

1305
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.908
Abel Salazar?

1306
01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:38.520
Yes. yes. you directed it
right to. right to his dirt box.

1307
01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:40.392
[Amy] <i>Okay. I'm gonna have
to call you right back.</i>

1308
01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:42.786
[suspenseful music]

1309
01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:44.526
Oh. fuck.

1310
01:01:44.613 --> 01:01:47.268
- [telephone ringing]
- Decker.

1311
01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:50.054
You set them up and
you used me to do it.

1312
01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:51.925
If I had told you everything.

1313
01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:53.492
<i>would you have gone
through with it?</i>

1314
01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.450
No. no. of course not.

1315
01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:57.801
Exactly. my point has been made.

1316
01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:59.280
What is in the box?

1317
01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:02.066
Hold on.

1318
01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:06.418
[folks chattering]

1319
01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:10.335
I am not at liberty to
divulge that information

1320
01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:12.598
at this point in time.
but what I can tell you

1321
01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:15.079
<i>is that it's much bigger
than you can imagine.</i>

1322
01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.558
Okay. if this is so big.

1323
01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:19.170
then why didn't we
just confiscate it?

1324
01:02:19.257 --> 01:02:21.172
[Decker] <i>Salazar's lawyers
are the best.</i>

1325
01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:22.782
As soon as they would've
found out that we knew.

1326
01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:24.088
they would've blocked
all legal channels.

1327
01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:26.612
and the box would've
magically disappeared.

1328
01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:30.747
Vern. Salazar's liaison
contacted me. Mr. Flowers.

1329
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.706
They are not messing around.
They wanna kill all of them.

1330
01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:35.969
[Decker] <i>Let's just hope
it doesn't get to that.</i>

1331
01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:37.884
But can you just shorten
his leash a little?

1332
01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:39.581
Give me some time!

1333
01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:41.496
Unfortunately. that
time's already passed.

1334
01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:43.281
Mr. Salazar's already
already gone over my head.

1335
01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:44.978
How can that be?

1336
01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:46.545
The fucking corrupt CIA.

1337
01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:48.765
They've activated joint
special operations.

1338
01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:51.506
This will be under military
jurisdiction by nightfall.

[Link] <i>Straight ahead.

What do we got?

1364
01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:34.435
It's a steel plate
in the middle.

1365
01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:35.436
It's gonna take
a while to drill.

1366
01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.960
Can we use a C4?

1367
01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:38.613
No. no. that's too
much attention.

1368
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.963
You got the cobalt drill?

1369
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:41.878

They're taking over. JSOC.

1376
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.167
I can try to stall them.

1377
01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:12.169

everybody's head.

When have I ever been smart?

Just let me know
how I can help you.

You can contact all your

I can try. I mean. it's gonna
take some time.

still releasing hostages.

1394
01:06:14.492 --> 01:06:16.189
This has been a
peaceful transaction.

1395
01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:18.017
The FBI has conceded
their authority.

1396
01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:21.978
and this operation is
under my jurisdiction now.

1397
01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:25.590
Sit tight. I should have this
wrapped up inside the hour.

1398
01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:26.939
Connect me to the
bank's main line.

1399
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:29.028
[JSOC Operator] You got it. sir.

1400
01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:30.856
You're welcome to stay.
but just get out of our way.

My name is Cyrus.
Commander Special Ops.

1406
01:06:53.139 --> 01:06:55.750
Conciliation is no
longer an option.

1407
01:06:55.837 --> 01:06:59.537
and negotiations are over.
Am I making myself clear?

1408
01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:03.193
Special Ops. whoa. we really
hit a nerve here. didn't we?

1409
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.760
You're going to release
the remaining hostages.

1410
01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:07.762
They will exit the
bank in a single file.

1411
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:09.721
And whenever I give the signal.

1412
01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:13.594
<i>you and your crew will follow.

1413
01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:15.422
Hands in the air?

1414
01:07:15.509 --> 01:07:18.251
Well. how are we supposed
to put hands in the air.

1415
01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:20.732
<i>and-- and push a--
a wheelbarrow?</i>

1416

<i>That's why you're here.

1420
01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:31.960

pulled some strings?

1421
01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:36.095
Leave everything inside the bank

1422
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.228
exactly where you found it.

1423
01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:41.231
In precisely 15 minutes from
the second that this call ends.

1424
01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:44.625
we are coming in with
extreme prejudice.

1425
01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:46.453
Okay. I'm not the
smartest guy in the world.

1426
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:50.109
but I know a threat
when I hear one.

1427
01:07:50.196 --> 01:07:52.024
So this is my counter to you.

1428

Okay. do you have a pen?

1429

Okay. good. are.

I love the name.

1738
01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:26.523
Okay. you know how this works.

1739
01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:29.047
You have to meet our demands

1740
01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:30.875
or the whole content
of that hard drive

1741
01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:33.182
gets released immediately.

1742
01:23:33.269 --> 01:23:35.445

we're dead or in jail.

- What are your demands?
- Okay. good.

1745
01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:44.062
So the first is I want my
crew released immediately.

1746
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:47.370
Um. I want identities
for all of us. new ones.

1747

each of our accounts.

and maybe 1 million for
each of the hostages.

That's it.

How should we proceed?

1758
01:24:26.322 --> 01:24:28.846
Well. I think first we
should blow up that C4

1759
01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:30.804
and uh. fake our deaths.

1760
01:24:30.891 --> 01:24:32.197

Well. guy's got to do his job.

01:24:45.602 --> 01:24:48.474
So where does that leave us?

1766
01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:49.910
Right back at the beginning.

1767
01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:56.613

Isn't it funny that
greatest score ever

1777
01:25:22.726 --> 01:25:26.860
was as a result of my kid
brother's incompetence?
