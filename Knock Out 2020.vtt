3
00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:21.491
He loved the boxing ring

4
00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.204
because like life...

5
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:29.327
The ring was about the fight for survival.

6
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.824
Truth is. before the age of six...

7
00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.074
I never saw my father.

8
00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:36.741
Whenever I asked about him

9
00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:42.076
mama always said he'd be back soon

10
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:45.083
welcome to the cotai arena here in Macau!
For today's main event...

11
00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.741
Introducing the challenger
Tanaka hiroshi!

12
00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.454
Going up against the
reigning and defending...

13
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.200
Ibf middleweight champion...

14
00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.699
Zhou shi.

15
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Shi!

16
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.866
Olympic champion zhou shi
turned pro 4 years ago.

17
00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.623
Known for his brute determination...

18
00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.828
To knockout opponents...

19
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.706
Shi remains undefeated.

20
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.750
Get him. shi!

21
00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:08.208
Beautiful!

22
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.707
Shi has Tanaka on the ropes.

23
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.119
Stop! Get back!

24
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.073
In your corners!

25
00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:26.199
Shi is fearless.

26
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.332
Exactly. he attacks like a mad wolf!

27
00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.081
He doesn't hold back.

28
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.823
Who will win the title tonight?

29
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.706
Will it be Japan's Tanaka...

30
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.832
With a 18-2-2 record?

31
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.240
Or our very own...

32
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:39.328
Zhou shi the wolf?

33
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.449
Undefeated. shi holds a record of...

34
00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:43.699
16 wins. 14 knockouts...

35
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.331
An 87.5% tko rate!

36
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.450
The fast boxer reigns supreme!

37
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.081
The bout resumes!

38
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.243
Box!

39
00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:56.499
Get him. Tanaka!

40
00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.328
Pace yourself.

41
00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:03.618
We're witnessing...

42
00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.999
Shi decimating Tanaka.

43
00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:07.375
Shi!

44
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Hit him!

45
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.615
Hit him!

46
00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.949
- That's a foul...
- Are you blind?

47
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:19.823
Despite Tanaka's illegal move...

48
00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.573
The referee hasn't stopped the fight.

49
00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:22.868
The bout continues.

50
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.455
Is that a smile?

51
00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:34.333
Whoa!

52
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:35.572
Shi is...

53
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:37.949
Out for blood. pounding Tanaka!

54
00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.494
Shi is on fire!

55
00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.954
Is he trying to kill Tanaka?

56
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Stop.

57
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:54.615
Shi!

58
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.873
Are you ok?

59
00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:56.875
Box.

60
00:03:58.167 --> 00:03:59.782
Stop! Stay back!

61
00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:03.785
Wow... shi literally knocked
Tanaka out of the ring!

62
00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:05.327
Fight's over!

63
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.447
Shi finished Tanaka with a left hook!

64
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.331
- Hey. papa won!
- Shi triumphs...

65
00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.198
- We won!
- With yet another ko win!

66
00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:14.448
Shi successfully...

67
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:16.574
Defended his title.

68
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.490
This bout has come to an end

69
00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:21.249
the winner by way of knockout...

70
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.865
And the ibf middleweight

71
00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.536
- champion of the world...
- Shi!

72
00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.869
Zhou shi!

73
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.040
King boxer... king boxer!

74
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.831
I feel boxing jabs!

75
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.081
I'm afraid our baby...

76
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.332
Will end up being a little boxer.

77
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.369
You still wear this?

78
00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:55.499
I'll get you a new one...

79
00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:56.702
Something nicer.

80
00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:00.824
You bought it after your first win.

81
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.869
You used every penny you had.

82
00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:07.124
What should I buy you this time?

83
00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:09.373
I don't need anything.

84
00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:13.114
I just want you and our child...

85
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:14.661
To be healthy and safe

86
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.831
In tonight's...

87
00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.116
Ibf championship fight.

88
00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:45.078
after losing in a tko.

89
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.744
Japanese boxer Tanaka...

90
00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:48.536
Was knocked out of the ring...

91
00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:50.658
And struck his head against a post.

92
00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:52.373
Tanaka was rushed to emergency.

93
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:54.411
He sustained skull base fractures...

94
00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:57.033
And suffered from paralysis
due to severe...

95
00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.452
Brain hemorrhaging.

96
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.699
Tanaka may never recover
from his comatose state.

97
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:03.996
The international boxing
federation expresses deep regrets.

98
00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:06.782
I'm standing here today.

99
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.115
After fighting for a decade.

100
00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.328
this is what I believe:

101
00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:13.994
Never hold back!

102
00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:14.872
Yes!

103
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.411
Never hold back!

104
00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:21.491
King boxer... king boxer!

105
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.500
Cheers!

106
00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.286
Avenge Tanaka!

107
00:06:25.292 --> 00:06:27.283
Boxing is not a license to kill!

108
00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.083
Don't move!

109
00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:38.622
Let my brothers go!

110
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.288
Let go!

111
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:43.768
Deal with me if you have a problem.

112
00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:45.999
You won't be leaving Macau tonight!

113
00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.375
Shi!

114
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.198
Xin.

115
00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:45.743
Xin...

116
00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:08.573
Police! Run!

117
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.081
- Let's go!
- Leave me.

118
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.240
Police are here.

119
00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:15.577
Let's go...

120
00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:18.833
Let's go!

121
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.949
Freeze! Hands behind your head!

122
00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:30.114
The defendant has been
found guilty of assault...

123
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.786
Causing bodily harm.

124
00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:35.205
In light of the extenuating circumstances.

125
00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:39.030
I sentence zhou shi to 6 years in prison.

126
00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:04.739
"Restricted area"

127
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.490
Where's Mina?

128
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.740
Get in the car.

129
00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:01.698
Really. tell me.

130
00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.369
If she wants to leave me...

131
00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:06.657
I understand.

132
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.660
She's dead.

133
00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:12.365
Mina passed away.

134
00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:19.583
It's...

135
00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.994
Nothing to joke about.

136
00:10:22.042 --> 00:10:23.703
Impossible.

137
00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.700
You can't be serious.

138
00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:39.198
It can't be true.

139
00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.573
That day Mina and your child...

140
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.207
Were walking down the street.

141
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.617
A car suddenly charged.

142
00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:50.994
The driver was drunk.

143
00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.449
Mina tried to protect your child...

144
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:58.074
By jumping in front of the car.

145
00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:00.743
She died.

146
00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:04.207
That was 3 months ago.

147
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.490
Impossible!

148
00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:18.373
She promised...

149
00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:21.285
To wait for me.

150
00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:24.873
Now she's gone?

151
00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:34.157
Are you kidding me?

152
00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:44.198
She was so young.

153
00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:21.707
I later learned that...

154
00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:23.619
Mina sold the house.

155
00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:25.077
But at least...

156
00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.619
She got a good price.

157
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:30.741
Mother and child had enough to live on.

158
00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:33.824
Plus the boxing club is nearby.

159
00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:37.374
Here's Mina's ID card. bank card and...

160
00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:39.115
Your child's birth certificate.

161
00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:40.657
Don't come here anymore.

162
00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:43.494
I don't want my daughter
to remember having...

163
00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:47.498
An inmate for a father.

164
00:13:55.833 --> 00:13:56.948
Shi.

165
00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.699
We'll wait for you at home.

166
00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:07.993
Where's my daughter?

167
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.206
Blithe. look.

168
00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:32.323
This is your father.

169
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:34.198
He's here to take you home.

170
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.832
You don't need to stay here anymore.

171
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:38.494
You can go home.

172
00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.995
I'm sorry. papa has come late.

173
00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:00.083
Blithe.

174
00:15:02.208 --> 00:15:03.448
Greet your father.

175
00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:11.497
He looks the same as the photos at home.

176
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.697
Blithe. he really is your father.

177
00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:23.448
I'm blithe.

178
00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:26.950
Mama said papa named me.

179
00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.323
True?

180
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:33.958
Yes.

181
00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:36.949
Blithe - carefree and happy.

182
00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:39.949
What took you so long?

183
00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.448
Where have you been?

184
00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:50.073
Papa was busy boxing.

185
00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:52.198
But I'm back now.

186
00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:56.949
Papa will never leave you again.

187
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.082
I'm going to bed.

188
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:54.371
Blithe. why are you still up?

189
00:17:57.458 --> 00:17:59.198
I'm sorry...

190
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:02.700
Did mama leave because of me?

191
00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:17.073
It's not your fault.

192
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.206
It is my fault.

193
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.494
I didn't take good care of mama.

194
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.115
I didn't take care of you.

195
00:18:34.167 --> 00:18:36.328
Don't cry.

196
00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.118
Come here.

197
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:42.244
Blithe and mama took so many pictures.

198
00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:45.327
Where's this from?

199
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.539
The park.

200
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.748
And this?

201
00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:50.914
Mama's birthday.

202
00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:53.624
We went to a restaurant.

203
00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:56.158
Take papa there next time. okay?

204
00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:20.869
Bring the chairs.

205
00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:26.573
Come... come eat!

206
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.824
Get the hotplate... over here.

207
00:19:30.083 --> 00:19:31.789
Can't you do anything right?

208
00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:33.328
Get the table.

209
00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:35.782
Brother.

210
00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:37.282
These past years...

211
00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:39.954
Boss put a lot of pressure on feng.

212
00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.494
To keep the boxing club afloat...

213
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.663
We even offer fitness and yoga classes...

214
00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:46.123
Anything to attract clients.

215
00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:48.122
Brothers.

216
00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:49.285
Feng.

217
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.447
King boxer shi has finally returned.

218
00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:55.618
Are you excited?

219
00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:56.702
Yes!

220
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.830
I'm announcing...

221
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.992
The official comeback of
the shi boxing squad!

222
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.240
Hurray!

223
00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:07.114
Shi.

224
00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:08.956
Drink up! Drink up!

225
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.164
A toast to you all.

226
00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.164
Cheers!

227
00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.909
Cheers...

228
00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:23.958
Feng.

229
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:27.539
I'm done with boxing.

230
00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:33.706
You're done?

231
00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:35.039
What will you do?

232
00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:39.452
Take care of my child.

233
00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:43.413
All the more reason for
you to make a comeback.

234
00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:45.703
Boxing can't be my only option.

235
00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:53.698
I'm past my prime.

236
00:20:54.583 --> 00:20:56.824
I don't belong in the ring anymore.

237
00:20:58.083 --> 00:21:00.699
I no longer have the hunger to win.

238
00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:04.869
What happened to the old shi...

239
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.367
Who was eager to fight each new opponent?

240
00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:12.532
Feng. I've lost too much.

241
00:21:13.917 --> 00:21:16.329
I just want to raise my daughter.

242
00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.289
She's all I have now.

243
00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:49.081
I'm sorry. Mr. zhou.

244
00:22:49.417 --> 00:22:52.739
We can't hire you with
your criminal record.

245
00:22:52.792 --> 00:22:54.657
But. sir! It was an accident.

246
00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:56.703
We have hiring guidelines.

247
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.331
Please understand.

248
00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:06.749
We require employees to be licensed.

249
00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:08.493
Are you licensed?

250
00:23:08.917 --> 00:23:09.906
Licensed?

251
00:23:09.917 --> 00:23:11.407
We're hiring chefs.

252
00:23:11.417 --> 00:23:13.829
Your past boxing career is irrelevant.

253
00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:15.619
You should know...

254
00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:17.161
We're stationed in Africa.

255
00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:18.703
Are you prepared to relocate?

256
00:23:18.708 --> 00:23:21.575
There's a 6 year gap in your work history.

257
00:23:21.583 --> 00:23:24.245
What were you doing during that period?

258
00:23:52.458 --> 00:23:53.914
Yang tai... who's Yang tai?

259
00:23:53.917 --> 00:23:54.997
Come in.

260
00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:00.448
Any related experience?

261
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.955
No.

262
00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:04.414
Can you ride a motorbike?

263
00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:05.623
Are you familiar with the roads...

264
00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:07.456
Of the nearby area?

265
00:24:07.792 --> 00:24:08.907
I can ride a motorbike.

266
00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:10.077
I'm a local.

267
00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.573
I know the area well.

268
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:13.072
Alright.

269
00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:14.539
7 yuan a pop; 400 orders a month.

270
00:24:14.542 --> 00:24:15.452
Start tomorrow.

271
00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:16.823
For each late delivery or complaint...

272
00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:18.243
A fine will be deducted from your pay.

273
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.410
Understood?

274
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.703
Understood.

275
00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:26.993
Blithe.

276
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.365
Wake up.

277
00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:33.328
Papa can't be late for
his first day of work.

278
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:34.618
Be good.

279
00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:36.167
Hey.

280
00:24:36.292 --> 00:24:38.157
You were drooling.

281
00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:40.914
Get up and wash you face.

282
00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:43.948
Please. get up.

283
00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:45.949
I'm going to be late.

284
00:24:45.958 --> 00:24:47.789
Help papa...

285
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.331
I'm sorry...

286
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:51.698
Time is running out.

287
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:52.875
Here.

288
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500
Here.

289
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.660
What would you like?

290
00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:11.498
Toast and omelet.

291
00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:15.708
Sure.

292
00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:50.667
Knife...

293
00:25:55.917 --> 00:25:57.282
Spatula... where is it?

294
00:25:57.292 --> 00:25:58.452
There.

295
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.740
Almost done.

296
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.830
Papa promises...

297
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.956
To do better tomorrow.

298
00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:42.074
Keep up the good work.

299
00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:45.458
Eat.

300
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.832
Wait for me here after school.

301
00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:57.199
Don't go anywhere until you see me.

302
00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:00.583
Bye.

303
00:27:02.708 --> 00:27:04.699
Your father is a delivery boy.

304
00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.448
No! Papa is a boxing champ.

305
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:08.448
Eat whatever you want.

306
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.457
Whenever you want...

307
00:27:11.708 --> 00:27:14.666
Just make your order...

308
00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:17.454
We deliver...

309
00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:20.454
On time...

310
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.366
With courteous service...

311
00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:24.990
Turn left.

312
00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:27.956
Forward! March!

313
00:27:29.583 --> 00:27:30.583
Park there.

314
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.910
No entry with takeout orders.

315
00:27:43.292 --> 00:27:44.452
I'm sorry. sir.

316
00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:45.664
Can I leave this here?

317
00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:47.123
Would you please notify the customer?

318
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.205
Why should 1?

319
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.491
Call him yourself.

320
00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:54.498
No calls allowed here.

321
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.910
Do it outside.

322
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.750
Go outside.

323
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:00.573
Hurry.

324
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.285
Mr. wang.

325
00:28:08.667 --> 00:28:10.328
I'm downstairs by the hotel entrance.

326
00:28:10.792 --> 00:28:12.532
The guards refuse to let me in.

327
00:28:12.542 --> 00:28:14.498
Please come downstairs to get your food?

328
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.706
I'll be waiting.

329
00:28:15.708 --> 00:28:16.708
Thank you.

330
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.536
Aren't you that...

331
00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:21.163
Boxing champion?

332
00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:22.282
You're mistaken.

333
00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:25.579
Show me some moves. I'm a fan.

334
00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:28.667
I'm busy.

335
00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:32.119
This boxer-turned-delivery-boy...

336
00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.831
Still thinks he's a bigshot.

337
00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:36.788
Cut that out.

338
00:28:36.792 --> 00:28:38.202
Don't tell me what to do.

339
00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:38.867
Stop it.

340
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:39.455
Smile...

341
00:28:39.458 --> 00:28:40.458
Stop it.

342
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.956
What's your problem?

343
00:28:42.917 --> 00:28:44.532
You broke my phone! Pay for it!

344
00:28:44.917 --> 00:28:46.327
Pay for it!

345
00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:51.828
Aren't you a champ? Hit me!

346
00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:53.869
Don't give me that look.

347
00:28:54.458 --> 00:28:55.743
Listen. loser.

348
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.035
I dare you to hit me.

349
00:28:57.042 --> 00:28:59.124
Go ahead. hit me.

350
00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:01.664
Why are you staring?

351
00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.077
Why?

352
00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:06.698
What do you want?

353
00:29:10.417 --> 00:29:11.417
Boss.

354
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.330
Brother.

355
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.750
Boss.

356
00:29:26.458 --> 00:29:27.573
He's my brother.

357
00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:30.161
My brother!

358
00:29:30.167 --> 00:29:32.704
I'm sorry. so sorry...

359
00:29:32.708 --> 00:29:33.663
You're in trouble!

360
00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:34.702
I'm so sorry...

361
00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:35.538
You're dead!

362
00:29:35.542 --> 00:29:37.032
I'm so sorry...

363
00:29:37.042 --> 00:29:38.623
I'll deal with you later.

364
00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:39.785
I'm sorry...

365
00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:51.872
Here.

366
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.083
Use this.

367
00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:02.164
They're lucky you held back...

368
00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:05.203
Or they'd be dead.

369
00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:09.823
Have one.

370
00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:18.495
What is it? Money problems?

371
00:30:22.417 --> 00:30:23.782
I can help you.

372
00:30:24.667 --> 00:30:26.157
I book boxing matches.

373
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:29.207
When you get out. come fight for me.

374
00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:33.454
I'm a boxer. not a thug.

375
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.785
Make the shot.

376
00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:48.083
Move.

377
00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:51.081
Protect the champ!

378
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.115
Stand back.

379
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.750
My turn.

380
00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:58.365
Yeah!

381
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.160
What have you been up to?

382
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.698
Nice uniform.

383
00:31:05.708 --> 00:31:07.790
Doing a reality show?

384
00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:10.123
You look good.

385
00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:12.081
I'll get you one if you like.

386
00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:22.539
You quit boxing

387
00:31:24.417 --> 00:31:27.159
to be a delivery boy?

388
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.911
It's a decent job.

389
00:31:30.917 --> 00:31:32.748
Boxing champ to delivery boy?

390
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:33.956
Are you sick?

391
00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:37.416
You should come work for me.

392
00:31:38.458 --> 00:31:40.369
I own many boxing clubs and hotels.

393
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:42.366
I book events. I need boxers.

394
00:31:43.542 --> 00:31:44.577
What do you say?

395
00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:47.331
I don't box anymore.

396
00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:52.790
I have to go pick up my
daughter from school.

397
00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:54.456
Thanks for your help.

398
00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:57.660
Brother.

399
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.831
We have cake today.

400
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:06.490
This is yours.

401
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.706
This one is mine.

402
00:32:08.958 --> 00:32:10.038
Eat this first.

403
00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:16.619
Wait... wipe it clean.

404
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.705
Good.

405
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:18.367
It's yummy.

406
00:32:18.417 --> 00:32:19.452
Really?

407
00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:51.740
Sir. is ♪11 ready?

408
00:32:51.792 --> 00:32:52.531
Yes.

409
00:32:52.542 --> 00:32:53.542
Here you go.

410
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:07.208
Papa.

411
00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:09.031
What is it?

412
00:33:09.042 --> 00:33:10.042
Nothing.

413
00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:19.868
Blithe.

414
00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:21.115
Put this on.

415
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.580
Don't catch a cold.

416
00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:25.823
Put this on.

417
00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:32.448
Stop running or I'll spank you.

418
00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:53.038
We're late.

419
00:33:53.042 --> 00:33:54.498
My pants are slipping.

420
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.161
Be good in school today.

421
00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.452
Put this on.

422
00:33:57.792 --> 00:33:59.498
Pick me up on time today.

423
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.865
I will. don't worry.

424
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:02.285
Okay. let's go.

425
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:03.327
Papa.

426
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:04.243
What?

427
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.250
It's a promise.

428
00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:06.875
It's a promise.

429
00:34:07.042 --> 00:34:08.042
Let's go.

430
00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:12.033
Blithe. let's wait inside?

431
00:34:17.375 --> 00:34:18.956
He's here. finally

432
00:34:18.958 --> 00:34:20.573
why are you so late?

433
00:34:20.583 --> 00:34:21.743
I'm sorry.

434
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.035
Blithe said you promised to...

435
00:34:23.042 --> 00:34:24.623
Pick her up at the gate.

436
00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:25.910
She refused to budge.

437
00:34:25.917 --> 00:34:27.077
My apologies.

438
00:34:27.333 --> 00:34:28.618
Take the umbrella.

439
00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:30.035
Get home safely.

440
00:34:30.042 --> 00:34:31.077
Thank you.

441
00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:32.323
- Thanks.
- No worries.

442
00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:34.956
Sorry. papa was late.

443
00:34:34.958 --> 00:34:38.576
I thought you died and left me.

444
00:34:43.417 --> 00:34:44.452
No.

445
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:47.995
Papa will never leave you.

446
00:34:50.042 --> 00:34:51.373
Papa will never be late again.

447
00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:53.490
You promise.

448
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.740
Be early next time.

449
00:34:55.167 --> 00:34:56.247
I promise.

450
00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:09.037
You have a fever. you can't go to school.

451
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:11.991
Am I going to die?

452
00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:14.282
No.

453
00:35:14.292 --> 00:35:16.032
Children get fevers all the time.

454
00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:19.949
I'm not a child.

455
00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:22.373
I'm a lady.

456
00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:27.533
My young lady...

457
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.580
Will get well soon.

458
00:35:30.958 --> 00:35:33.825
Boss. I need to take the day off.

459
00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:34.948
A day off?

460
00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.664
Just quit then.

461
00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:37.782
Don't bother coming back.

462
00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:39.373
That's not what I meant.

463
00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:40.535
Just for today?

464
00:35:40.542 --> 00:35:41.827
My daughter has a fever.

465
00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:43.539
When people don't want to work...

466
00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:44.827
It's always a family emergency.

467
00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:46.698
Sick parents. sick children...

468
00:35:46.708 --> 00:35:47.823
We don't need you.

469
00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:48.993
Boss...

470
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Hello?

471
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.035
Feng.

472
00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:04.490
I want to come back here to work...

473
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.572
As a janitor or trainer. anything.

474
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:10.907
I need a place where...

475
00:36:10.917 --> 00:36:12.157
I can also look after...

476
00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:13.823
Blithe.

477
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.240
Some white wine?

478
00:36:43.458 --> 00:36:44.789
Hello. everyone.

479
00:36:44.792 --> 00:36:47.829
I'm zhou shi's daughter. blithe.

480
00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:49.744
I'm not here to train.

481
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.911
But I'll be good.

482
00:36:53.542 --> 00:36:54.622
You're so cute.

483
00:36:54.625 --> 00:36:55.625
Hi.

484
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.956
Go do your homework over there.

485
00:36:57.958 --> 00:36:59.164
Papa will check on you later.

486
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:42.958
Brother.

487
00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.664
This is my weight loss class.

488
00:37:45.667 --> 00:37:46.907
Take over for me.

489
00:37:46.917 --> 00:37:48.282
Don't push them too hard

490
00:37:48.292 --> 00:37:49.577
or they won't return.

491
00:37:49.875 --> 00:37:51.365
I've got to go.

492
00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:53.073
Go.

493
00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:58.948
You're stuck.

494
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:02.285
Have one.

495
00:38:04.208 --> 00:38:05.323
It's delicious.

496
00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:06.702
Pubg?

497
00:38:10.417 --> 00:38:11.372
Do a lap first.

498
00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.375
Huh?

499
00:38:12.958 --> 00:38:14.243
Can't I finish the game first?

500
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.285
Let's move.

501
00:38:16.917 --> 00:38:18.373
Return my snack afterwards.

502
00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:21.538
Your phone.

503
00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:23.956
Don't let me die.

504
00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:25.038
Keep an eye on it.

505
00:38:25.583 --> 00:38:26.914
I'm an actor in real life.

506
00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:30.624
I've been in lots of films and TV shows...

507
00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:32.866
Just bit parts with almost no lines.

508
00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:36.074
All the directors think I'm talented.

509
00:38:36.875 --> 00:38:38.240
But I think my fat body...

510
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.866
Is holding back my career.

511
00:38:42.875 --> 00:38:43.705
Come.

512
00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:44.493
One. two.

513
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.205
Come.

514
00:38:45.208 --> 00:38:45.947
One. two.

515
00:38:45.958 --> 00:38:46.447
Come.

516
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:47.664
One. two. three. four.

517
00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:51.198
I'm an attorney.

518
00:38:51.708 --> 00:38:52.823
Business is okay.

519
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.948
But because I'm so skinny...

520
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.706
People think...

521
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.456
I'm untrustworthy.

522
00:38:58.458 --> 00:38:59.573
I thought boxing...

523
00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:01.456
Would make me stronger

524
00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:02.573
and bigger.

525
00:39:08.583 --> 00:39:10.164
I own a small pub.

526
00:39:10.167 --> 00:39:11.452
I work at night.

527
00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:13.240
I've had my heart broken...

528
00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:14.740
Many times.

529
00:39:15.167 --> 00:39:17.249
But I refuse to give up on myself...

530
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.457
Even after dating so many jerks.

531
00:39:19.458 --> 00:39:20.493
I want to box...

532
00:39:20.833 --> 00:39:23.074
I want Donnie yen's skill and...

533
00:39:23.083 --> 00:39:23.947
Eddie peng's body.

534
00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:24.788
Leading man...

535
00:39:24.792 --> 00:39:25.531
One. two.

536
00:39:25.542 --> 00:39:26.281
Leading man...

537
00:39:26.292 --> 00:39:27.202
One. two. three. four

538
00:39:27.208 --> 00:39:27.993
leading man...

539
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.036
I want to show those directors that...

540
00:39:30.042 --> 00:39:31.282
I can do it!

541
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.706
My goal is simple:

542
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:37.496
Firm chest. toned arms. perky butt.

543
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.115
And abs.

544
00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:48.950
Igawa decimates his opponent
with a flurry of punches.

545
00:39:49.458 --> 00:39:51.058
His speedy attack strategy is working...

546
00:39:51.333 --> 00:39:53.289
70 seconds into the round one...

547
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.332
Igawa already ko'd his challenger!

548
00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:59.120
General guan defeated the villain
before his wine cooled.

549
00:39:59.458 --> 00:40:01.039
We didn't even finish a beer before...

550
00:40:01.042 --> 00:40:02.077
He got ko'd.

551
00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:03.994
They promised 12 rounds.

552
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.911
I want my 12 rounds.

553
00:40:06.083 --> 00:40:08.699
Uncle feng. who's that man?

554
00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:11.073
Igawa yuji...

555
00:40:11.083 --> 00:40:13.119
The current ibf middleweight champion.

556
00:40:13.125 --> 00:40:14.786
He's only 24.

557
00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:16.657
Since turning pro...

558
00:40:16.667 --> 00:40:17.998
He hasn't been defeated

559
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.080
just like your father.

560
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.493
Champion?

561
00:40:20.792 --> 00:40:22.328
Isn't that papa?

562
00:40:23.375 --> 00:40:25.331
Your papa was the champ.

563
00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:28.040
But when he quit boxing...

564
00:40:28.042 --> 00:40:31.159
Igawa took his place.

565
00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:33.249
Uncle feng. you're lying.

566
00:40:33.583 --> 00:40:35.073
My papa is still the champ!

567
00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:36.948
Stop lying or I'll get mad!

568
00:40:36.958 --> 00:40:37.993
Blithe.

569
00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:39.618
Calm down.

570
00:40:54.917 --> 00:41:02.917
"Little eyes see the world.
lighting the once cold place"

571
00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:14.208
"only realized when they come alive."

572
00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:20.415
"Love is being bold
enough to make a choice."

573
00:41:20.958 --> 00:41:26.123
"it turns bitter into sweet."

574
00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:32.993
"protecting an innocent heart..."

575
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.664
"From harm."

576
00:41:48.958 --> 00:41:50.448
Uncle. keep fighting.

577
00:41:50.958 --> 00:41:52.118
Uncle. keep fighting.

578
00:41:52.458 --> 00:41:53.458
Uncle. keep fighting.

579
00:41:54.083 --> 00:41:55.493
Uncle. keep fighting.

580
00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:01.198
What happened?

581
00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:03.073
Why are they saying that?

582
00:42:03.292 --> 00:42:05.749
I told them that you're a boxing champ...

583
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.035
And they'll see you on TV soon

584
00:42:07.042 --> 00:42:09.249
defeating igawa yuji.

585
00:42:11.292 --> 00:42:12.532
You...

586
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Let's go.

587
00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:20.199
Has papa's cooking improved?

588
00:42:20.208 --> 00:42:21.914
Big improvement.

589
00:42:21.917 --> 00:42:23.282
How was school today?

590
00:42:23.292 --> 00:42:24.292
Good.

591
00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:25.827
Blithe.

592
00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:28.623
What do you want to be when you grow up?

593
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.910
I want to write stories.

594
00:42:31.292 --> 00:42:32.623
A writer?

595
00:42:32.958 --> 00:42:33.958
Yes.

596
00:42:35.042 --> 00:42:36.623
Will you write about me?

597
00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:38.083
Yes!

598
00:42:38.375 --> 00:42:41.287
I'll write about my beloved papa.

599
00:42:41.958 --> 00:42:43.744
Papa. I want water.

600
00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.744
I'll get you some.

601
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.115
Were you a good girl today?

602
00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:04.414
Someone's here for you.

603
00:43:04.417 --> 00:43:05.953
I already told her you weren't here.

604
00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:07.414
Is everything okay?

605
00:43:09.167 --> 00:43:10.657
I'll find out.

606
00:43:11.958 --> 00:43:12.958
Come.

607
00:44:00.292 --> 00:44:01.498
You can't just slap people!

608
00:44:02.042 --> 00:44:03.327
I didn't slap anyone

609
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.081
just him.

610
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:08.698
I'll kill him.

611
00:44:08.917 --> 00:44:10.703
Give her back.

612
00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:12.577
Didn't you promise...

613
00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.494
To take good care of her?

614
00:44:14.792 --> 00:44:16.157
Give her back.

615
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:19.115
Give her back to me.

616
00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:33.414
Stop.

617
00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:35.373
Don't hit my papa.

618
00:44:44.417 --> 00:44:45.657
He's your father?

619
00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:47.208
Yes.

620
00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:48.993
Mina wang is...

621
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.331
My mama.

622
00:44:56.375 --> 00:44:58.957
Let me hug you.

623
00:44:58.958 --> 00:44:59.993
Come.

624
00:45:00.167 --> 00:45:00.826
No!

625
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:02.243
Don't be afraid.

626
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:04.206
I'm your mama's mother.

627
00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:10.032
Greet your grandma.

628
00:45:15.333 --> 00:45:16.743
You bastard.

629
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.706
If Mina hadn't met you...

630
00:45:18.708 --> 00:45:21.165
She wouldn't have come
to such a tragic end.

631
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:23.039
With such a lowlife...

632
00:45:24.583 --> 00:45:26.699
How could you bring a child here?

633
00:45:27.083 --> 00:45:28.664
You want to ruin her life too?

634
00:45:28.667 --> 00:45:31.579
No! Papa takes good care of me.

635
00:45:34.292 --> 00:45:35.577
In the beginning.

636
00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:38.290
your mama said the same thing...

637
00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:40.248
When she came home to visit...

638
00:45:41.083 --> 00:45:43.449
That he took good care of her.

639
00:45:46.583 --> 00:45:47.743
In the end?

640
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:53.744
In the end...

641
00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:05.706
Name your price.

642
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.286
I'm taking her away.

643
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.036
She's my daughter.

644
00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:16.414
My daughter gave birth to her.

645
00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:18.323
She's my daughter's child.

646
00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:19.664
She's mine too.

647
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.240
See you in court.

648
00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:16.872
Miss zhou.

649
00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.957
Your grandmother is expecting you.

650
00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:21.032
Papa. I'm scared.

651
00:47:21.042 --> 00:47:23.033
Do I have to go?

652
00:47:30.458 --> 00:47:32.073
She's your grandma.

653
00:47:32.875 --> 00:47:34.706
Mama would have wanted you to...

654
00:47:34.958 --> 00:47:35.743
Visit her...

655
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:37.365
Do I have to go to Hong Kong?

656
00:47:37.375 --> 00:47:39.582
It's so far away.

657
00:47:39.583 --> 00:47:41.869
Two days is too long.

658
00:47:42.792 --> 00:47:44.748
Mama grew up in Hong Kong.

659
00:47:44.875 --> 00:47:46.331
She would have wanted you to see it.

660
00:47:46.542 --> 00:47:48.658
Two days will go by in a flash.

661
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.866
Papa. pick me up on time...

662
00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:53.285
Be on time.

663
00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:56.619
No... be early.

664
00:47:57.917 --> 00:47:58.952
I promise you.

665
00:48:01.792 --> 00:48:03.874
I'll miss you.

666
00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:06.078
Don't forget me.

667
00:48:06.958 --> 00:48:08.414
Listen to your grandma.

668
00:48:08.417 --> 00:48:09.623
Let's go.

669
00:48:12.083 --> 00:48:14.368
Bye.

670
00:48:26.208 --> 00:48:27.208
Madam fang.

671
00:48:27.583 --> 00:48:28.583
She's here.

672
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.581
Blithe.

673
00:48:30.958 --> 00:48:31.958
Hey.

674
00:48:32.208 --> 00:48:33.493
Do you want water?

675
00:48:35.792 --> 00:48:36.622
Look.

676
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:39.583
Grandma brought all these toys for you.

677
00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.406
Come.

678
00:48:41.417 --> 00:48:44.033
Let's play with... beads?

679
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.831
We'll make you a necklace?

680
00:48:45.833 --> 00:48:46.993
It'll be pretty.

681
00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:48.455
Never mind.

682
00:48:50.292 --> 00:48:51.372
This?

683
00:48:53.375 --> 00:48:57.948
Blithe. whatever you want...

684
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.412
Just ask grandma.

685
00:49:00.417 --> 00:49:02.703
Except for the stars in the sky...

686
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:05.370
Grandma can get you anything.

687
00:49:07.125 --> 00:49:11.038
If 1 accept your gifts. can I go home?

688
00:49:16.917 --> 00:49:18.782
You may leave in a few days.

689
00:49:20.333 --> 00:49:21.413
In the meantime...

690
00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:25.624
Keep grandma company.

691
00:49:26.042 --> 00:49:28.249
Just play with grandma for a few days?

692
00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:29.990
Please?

693
00:49:45.667 --> 00:49:47.077
Do you like to read?

694
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.740
Cinderella

695
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.581
do you know the story?

696
00:49:54.333 --> 00:49:56.995
She ends up becoming a Princess.

697
00:49:58.708 --> 00:50:02.246
Grandma has many books
here. take your time.

698
00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:05.948
One of the determining factors...

699
00:50:05.958 --> 00:50:07.664
Is blithe's relationship...

700
00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:10.204
With you and with her grandmother.

701
00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:12.290
Now that she's with her grandmother.

702
00:50:12.292 --> 00:50:14.283
If they bond.

703
00:50:14.292 --> 00:50:16.078
it doesn't bode well for your case.

704
00:50:16.792 --> 00:50:18.908
Your mother-in-law already
filed the lawsuit.

705
00:50:19.375 --> 00:50:21.832
You even delivered blithe to the enemy.

706
00:50:21.833 --> 00:50:23.789
The closest person to blithe now...

707
00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:25.706
Other than me. is her grandmother.

708
00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:27.577
Well. it's up to you.

709
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.037
Blithe. look at grandma's outfit.

710
00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:41.993
Is it pretty?

711
00:50:43.292 --> 00:50:44.577
Are you happy?

712
00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:49.204
The world is a big place.

713
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:53.239
Grandma will take you around the world...

714
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.242
To see the different countries.

715
00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:58.407
It's my first time on a plane

716
00:50:58.417 --> 00:51:00.328
and my first time on a boat.

717
00:51:00.417 --> 00:51:03.614
From now on. we'll fly...

718
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:05.035
And sail everywhere.

719
00:51:06.667 --> 00:51:07.622
When you grow up...

720
00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:11.038
I'll send you to the best school.

721
00:51:11.292 --> 00:51:12.828
You'll get the best education...

722
00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:14.789
And visit the most exciting places.

723
00:51:15.917 --> 00:51:17.873
We'll take papa along.

724
00:51:21.417 --> 00:51:23.578
Your situation looks grim.

725
00:51:23.583 --> 00:51:24.868
First. your mother-in-law is...

726
00:51:24.875 --> 00:51:27.116
A major shareholder of a public company.

727
00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:28.456
She's rich.

728
00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:30.449
You just can't compete financially.

729
00:51:30.458 --> 00:51:31.072
Secondly...

730
00:51:31.083 --> 00:51:32.118
Enough.

731
00:51:32.125 --> 00:51:33.535
I know my situation.

732
00:51:34.042 --> 00:51:35.202
No matter what...

733
00:51:35.208 --> 00:51:36.823
I won't give blithe up.

734
00:51:36.833 --> 00:51:37.572
Fine.

735
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.619
Then we'll need to prove that...

736
00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:42.082
She's unfit to care for a child.

737
00:51:42.083 --> 00:51:43.823
I'll do my best to help you.

738
00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:49.989
Let me show you our family photos.

739
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.788
Look. this is your grandfather.

740
00:51:54.792 --> 00:51:56.532
He's American.

741
00:51:57.458 --> 00:52:01.121
This is your uncle Bruce.

742
00:52:01.792 --> 00:52:06.456
This is your auntie Annie.

743
00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:08.243
Your mama.

744
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.741
Your mama and I were very close
when she was little.

745
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.163
I loved your mama best.

746
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:20.242
When did mama meet papa?

747
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.581
When she's 19...

748
00:52:23.292 --> 00:52:25.908
Shi came to Hong Kong to train.

749
00:52:26.792 --> 00:52:28.657
I was against it from the start.

750
00:52:31.417 --> 00:52:32.827
Why?

751
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:37.083
Boxers are not husband materials...

752
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.367
Nothing but muscle and brawn.

753
00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:44.323
Mina. stop right there.

754
00:52:45.083 --> 00:52:47.825
I'm warning you. if you leave...

755
00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:49.698
And marry that boxer...

756
00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:51.539
Don't ever come back!

757
00:52:51.542 --> 00:52:53.328
I'll disown you

758
00:52:53.333 --> 00:52:55.164
even after you die!

759
00:52:55.167 --> 00:52:56.202
Ma.

760
00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:58.743
Don't worry.

761
00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:00.248
Take care.

762
00:53:00.583 --> 00:53:03.746
I missed your mama dearly.

763
00:53:04.125 --> 00:53:06.081
I often worried about her.

764
00:53:09.708 --> 00:53:11.118
A few years ago...

765
00:53:11.958 --> 00:53:13.698
I fell ill.

766
00:53:14.208 --> 00:53:17.951
It was a long and difficult recovery.

767
00:53:18.625 --> 00:53:20.456
When I was ill...

768
00:53:22.167 --> 00:53:24.704
I had time to reflect...

769
00:53:25.708 --> 00:53:29.371
Maybe I wasn't a good mother.

770
00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:33.164
I was too strict.

771
00:53:36.583 --> 00:53:39.199
If I was nicer to your mama.

772
00:53:40.667 --> 00:53:42.123
perhaps...

773
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:46.371
She would have come to
me when she needed help.

774
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.036
I could have helped her.

775
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:57.117
You know. you resemble your mama...

776
00:53:57.125 --> 00:53:58.490
In many ways.

777
00:54:11.625 --> 00:54:13.581
Treat uncle to a candy.

778
00:54:17.167 --> 00:54:18.703
You ate his candy.

779
00:54:40.542 --> 00:54:42.578
Mr. zhou. madam fang asked
me to inform you...

780
00:54:42.583 --> 00:54:43.948
No need to wait.

781
00:54:43.958 --> 00:54:46.290
Miss had a long day and is now asleep.

782
00:54:46.292 --> 00:54:47.953
We'll send her back tomorrow.

783
00:54:47.958 --> 00:54:49.164
Don't worry.

784
00:55:50.542 --> 00:55:51.327
Blithe. you're back.

785
00:55:51.333 --> 00:55:52.333
Yes.

786
00:55:56.167 --> 00:55:57.167
Papa.

787
00:55:57.833 --> 00:55:59.949
Grandma gave me lots of presents...

788
00:55:59.958 --> 00:56:01.448
Like this iPad

789
00:56:03.417 --> 00:56:05.123
I finally have my own iPad.

790
00:56:05.792 --> 00:56:06.872
Look.

791
00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:10.039
I have so many toys.

792
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:11.205
Like this one...

793
00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:12.789
I can finally...

794
00:56:12.792 --> 00:56:14.032
Plays drums.

795
00:56:14.167 --> 00:56:16.158
And with this one... I won't feel...

796
00:56:21.292 --> 00:56:22.077
Also...

797
00:56:22.083 --> 00:56:24.825
Grandma gave me lots of stuffed animals.

798
00:56:25.125 --> 00:56:26.490
They're so much fun.

799
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.660
Like this one...

800
00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:32.743
Super fun.

801
00:56:35.333 --> 00:56:36.994
When I'm bored...

802
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.036
I can play with it.

803
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:44.750
Blithe.

804
00:56:46.458 --> 00:56:47.573
Are you hungry?

805
00:56:48.917 --> 00:56:50.782
Last night grandma and I...

806
00:56:50.792 --> 00:56:53.704
Watched fireworks as we ate dinner.

807
00:56:54.083 --> 00:56:55.914
We also watched a magic show

808
00:56:55.917 --> 00:56:58.454
and saw a real Princess.

809
00:56:58.458 --> 00:57:00.323
We also flew on a plane

810
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:02.369
and went to ocean park.

811
00:57:02.375 --> 00:57:03.205
Mr. zhou. we're leaving now.

812
00:57:03.208 --> 00:57:04.914
It was super fun.

813
00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:08.789
Look at this

814
00:57:10.125 --> 00:57:11.581
and this

815
00:57:14.958 --> 00:57:16.994
and the clothes.

816
00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:19.618
Is it pretty?

817
00:57:28.083 --> 00:57:29.083
Blithe...

818
00:57:30.708 --> 00:57:32.744
Want to live with grandma
and study in the uk?

819
00:57:32.792 --> 00:57:33.907
The uk?

820
00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.953
Do they have fun stuff there?

821
00:57:35.958 --> 00:57:37.823
And real princesses?

822
00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:46.823
You can't play all the time.

823
00:57:47.083 --> 00:57:48.573
You should study too.

824
00:57:49.208 --> 00:57:50.618
What are you saying?

825
00:57:51.208 --> 00:57:52.698
I get good grades.

826
00:57:52.708 --> 00:57:54.039
That's not enough.

827
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:57.914
You need to learn more.

828
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.616
Grandma can give you things I can't.

829
00:58:02.375 --> 00:58:03.865
If you stay with me. you'll be...

830
00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:05.618
A loser.

831
00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:08.241
What do you mean "loser"?

832
00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:26.449
Zhou shi was a terrible husband.

833
00:58:26.917 --> 00:58:29.533
He convinced my daughter to...

834
00:58:29.542 --> 00:58:31.373
Leave me and cut all ties.

835
00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:34.207
I didn't hear from them after they eloped.

836
00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:38.573
Back then. zhou shi promised to...

837
00:58:38.583 --> 00:58:40.539
Take good care of my daughter.

838
00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:41.955
In the end...

839
00:58:42.625 --> 00:58:45.367
He only cared about his boxing career.

840
00:58:45.792 --> 00:58:47.828
When my daughter was about...

841
00:58:47.833 --> 00:58:50.165
To deliver her baby...

842
00:58:50.167 --> 00:58:51.373
Where was he?

843
00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:55.246
He was in prison. serving
a sentence for assault.

844
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.457
He abandoned his wife and child.

845
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.706
My mother-in-law is right.

846
00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:04.869
I was a terrible husband...

847
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:07.323
And a bad father.

848
00:59:10.542 --> 00:59:12.453
When my wife and daughter...

849
00:59:12.875 --> 00:59:13.864
Needed me the most...

850
00:59:13.875 --> 00:59:15.206
I wasn't there for them.

851
00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:20.074
I've already lost my wife.

852
00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:23.869
I will not give up my daughter.

853
00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:25.661
By the time I found zhou shi.

854
00:59:25.667 --> 00:59:28.204
I discovered he was
raising my grandchild...

855
00:59:28.208 --> 00:59:31.530
In a sleazy boxing club.

856
00:59:32.333 --> 00:59:34.665
The child is still in her formative years.

857
00:59:35.083 --> 00:59:36.289
As a father.

858
00:59:36.292 --> 00:59:39.409
he should encourage her
to learn and study...

859
00:59:39.417 --> 00:59:41.749
Instead of taking her to a boxing club.

860
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.332
And exposing her to such a violent sport.

861
00:59:44.333 --> 00:59:46.824
zhou shi is unfit to be a father.

862
00:59:47.208 --> 00:59:49.449
His actions prove that...

863
00:59:49.458 --> 00:59:51.574
He's negligent...

864
00:59:51.583 --> 00:59:52.823
Woefully unqualified...

865
00:59:52.833 --> 00:59:55.825
And incapable of raising
my grandchild properly.

866
00:59:56.167 --> 00:59:58.453
I'm struggling to earn a living...

867
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.411
I can't always provide the best...

868
01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:04.948
In terms of properly caring for her.

869
01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:07.493
But...

870
01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:10.619
It doesn't mean that I don't love her.

871
01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:12.782
I'm a successful business woman...

872
01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:14.748
Major shareholder of a public company.

873
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.707
I have the means and resources...

874
01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:18.948
To provide for my grandchild...

875
01:00:18.958 --> 01:00:21.916
In a safe and nurturing environment

876
01:00:21.917 --> 01:00:24.374
with the best education.

877
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:27.533
I implore the court to...

878
01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.749
Award me the custody of my grandchild.

879
01:00:30.042 --> 01:00:32.408
Zhou shi escorts blithe
to and from school himself.

880
01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:34.078
He has never been late...

881
01:00:34.292 --> 01:00:35.452
Rain or shine.

882
01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:37.289
He's devoted to her.

883
01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:39.786
He's more punctual than most parents.

884
01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:41.578
When shi was the boxing champ.

885
01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:43.619
he made hundreds of thousands...

886
01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:45.081
From just one match.

887
01:00:45.667 --> 01:00:48.409
He could afford houses and cars.

888
01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:51.078
Today. for his child's sake...

889
01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:51.868
He's left...

890
01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.957
The boxing career that he loved.

891
01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:57.328
Let me ask everyone here.

892
01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.039
Haven't we all...

893
01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:00.873
Encountered setbacks in life?

894
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:07.873
Truth is. I love my mama the most.

895
01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:10.914
But she went...

896
01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.124
Somewhere faraway.

897
01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:19.706
I know grandma loves me and she's amazing.

898
01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:23.330
She can buy me many things

899
01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:25.949
that papa cannot.

900
01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:30.333
But when papa holds me in his arms.

901
01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:33.409
I feel like...

902
01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:36.249
Mama is still with me.

903
01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:40.451
I feel like I still have a family.

904
01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:46.200
Every time I call for him.

905
01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:48.707
papa comes immediately.

906
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.206
I believe in him.

907
01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:57.451
I know papa will never abandon me.

908
01:01:58.208 --> 01:02:00.244
I know he loves me.

909
01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:03.949
If we were to part...

910
01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:07.207
It would break my heart.

911
01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.457
Papa is good to me.

912
01:02:11.833 --> 01:02:15.530
When I can't sleep. he keeps me company.

913
01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:20.242
He makes me breakfast everyday.

914
01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:27.955
When I'm sad. he hugs me.

915
01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.823
he comforts me.

916
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.745
Grandma. I don't want your gifts.

917
01:02:37.167 --> 01:02:39.032
I just want papa.

918
01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:04.493
Listen...

919
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.866
The court may have faith
in you but I don't.

920
01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:08.956
I'll use every means at my disposal...

921
01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:10.948
Until you surrender custody.

922
01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.115
Hold me - come.

923
01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.994
Look at the skyline.

924
01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:37.577
It's beautiful.

925
01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:42.034
The stars have gone home
because of the rain.

926
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.115
Papa.

927
01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:47.198
Will you leave me one day?

928
01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:51.909
Papa will never leave you ever again.

929
01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:02.373
Hot water! Hot water!

930
01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:04.990
Here we go.

931
01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:08.417
Good.

932
01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:10.042
Thanks.

933
01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:11.414
Well. umm...

934
01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:13.203
Everyone. I want to say a few words

935
01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.998
I know I'm not a good speaker.

936
01:04:16.917 --> 01:04:18.407
I just want to thank you all...

937
01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:20.248
For helping me in my time of need.

938
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.036
And... and blithe...

939
01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:23.330
Umm...

940
01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:24.948
Enough.

941
01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:27.198
Shi and I went to the superstore today.

942
01:04:27.625 --> 01:04:29.991
Australian-raised Mongolian beef.

943
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.490
It's fattier than me.

944
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.990
We also have Mongolian shrimps.

945
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.786
I picked everything.

946
01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:36.578
He paid the bill.

947
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.661
Let's get started.

948
01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:39.577
More meat...

949
01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.619
Your favorite - jujube.

950
01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:43.410
Hot!

951
01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:44.953
Have you never eaten hotpot?

952
01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:47.452
Just eat your shrimp.

953
01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:48.288
Keep eating.

954
01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:49.873
Where's my meatball?

955
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.080
Where?

956
01:04:51.083 --> 01:04:51.822
Here.

957
01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:52.413
In my mouth.

958
01:04:52.417 --> 01:04:53.202
That's mine. give it back...

959
01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:54.664
Can I have more sauce. please?

960
01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:56.157
Let's get more later.

961
01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:57.702
You lost. drink up.

962
01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:59.539
No. you lost.

963
01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:02.033
Hey. you hit my face.

964
01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:05.567
I will do laundry when we get home.

965
01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.158
Messy.

966
01:05:09.417 --> 01:05:10.577
Drink up!

967
01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:14.997
We're out of meat.

968
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.614
Hot!

969
01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:16.917
Hot!

970
01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:17.781
Hot!

971
01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:18.792
What is it?

972
01:05:18.917 --> 01:05:19.656
Grow up.

973
01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:20.747
Bring me water.

974
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.365
Come drink some water.

975
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:23.080
Come.

976
01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:23.913
Okay...

977
01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:25.453
Drink some water...

978
01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:27.748
Some stupid prank of yours!

979
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.250
Hey...

980
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:32.240
Come on...

981
01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:34.912
Just a bit of chili pepper. You'll be fine.

982
01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:38.874
She coughs... blood.

983
01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.365
Papa. it hurts.

984
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.410
You fed her chili pepper?

985
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.162
It's okay. papa's here...

986
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.489
Don't be afraid.

987
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.910
We'll go to the hospital?

988
01:05:47.917 --> 01:05:48.781
Let's go now?

989
01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:49.907
Let's go.

990
01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:55.705
This way.

991
01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:56.413
Doctor...

992
01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:57.532
Doctor?

993
01:05:57.542 --> 01:05:58.998
Where's the emergency room?

994
01:05:59.042 --> 01:05:59.997
Through there.

995
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.456
Over there...

996
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.456
Straight ahead...

997
01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:06.163
Papa.

998
01:06:06.167 --> 01:06:07.202
Almost done...

999
01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:08.414
Papa's here.

1000
01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:10.782
It's okay...

1001
01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:13.368
Almost done.

1002
01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:14.955
Don't worry.

1003
01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:16.789
Don't worry.

1004
01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:20.573
My daughter just choked a little.

1005
01:06:21.042 --> 01:06:22.452
Why is she bleeding so much?

1006
01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:26.248
Doctor. is she okay?

1007
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.490
Her nosebleed has stopped.

1008
01:06:27.833 --> 01:06:28.913
Based on her current condition...

1009
01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:30.498
I recommend admitting her for observation

1010
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.956
and further tests.

1011
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:37.162
These are blithe's test results

1012
01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:40.369
that confirm...

1013
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:44.038
Your daughter has acute
lymphocytic leukemia.

1014
01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.328
Treating leukemia...

1015
01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:50.789
Is a long and difficult process.

1016
01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:53.119
We need to immediately...

1017
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:54.285
Begin chemotherapy.

1018
01:06:54.792 --> 01:06:56.282
How is this possible?

1019
01:06:56.292 --> 01:06:58.328
My daughter is healthy.

1020
01:06:58.333 --> 01:06:59.698
I understand how you feel.

1021
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:02.950
Chemotherapy causes severe side effects.

1022
01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:05.824
But success rates are improving.

1023
01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:09.659
There's only a 20% chance of recurrence.

1024
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.536
But we can also try...

1025
01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:13.624
A bone marrow transplant.

1026
01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:15.869
After successful treatment...

1027
01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.331
Survival rates are quite high.

1028
01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:19.414
The outlook for your child...

1029
01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:21.328
Is still positive.

1030
01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:24.032
You must not despair.

1031
01:07:26.708 --> 01:07:30.121
Doctor. there must be a mistake...

1032
01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:32.031
Listen...

1033
01:07:32.042 --> 01:07:34.249
Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants...

1034
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.536
Are quite costly.

1035
01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:39.784
Make the necessary financial
arrangements quickly.

1036
01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:41.243
That's all.

1037
01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:44.740
Hang in there. blithe.

1038
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:46.081
Almost done.

1039
01:08:46.083 --> 01:08:47.914
Stop...

1040
01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.123
It hurts.

1041
01:08:53.042 --> 01:08:54.452
It hurts.

1042
01:08:57.792 --> 01:08:59.032
Stop...

1043
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:01.910
It hurts.

1044
01:09:04.542 --> 01:09:06.533
It hurts.

1045
01:09:08.333 --> 01:09:10.790
Stop...

1046
01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:18.123
It's done.

1047
01:09:35.583 --> 01:09:38.495
Blithe. don't worry. papa's here.

1048
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.037
Papa. it hurts.

1049
01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:43.283
Am I going to die?

1050
01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:44.865
No.

1051
01:09:45.708 --> 01:09:47.198
You're the daughter of a champ.

1052
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.831
We won't lose this fight.

1053
01:09:49.833 --> 01:09:51.915
But it hurts.

1054
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.740
I'm tired.

1055
01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:56.704
No more needles.

1056
01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:59.081
Blithe. you know...

1057
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.036
Papa has taken a few blows in the ring.

1058
01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.994
It's the same in life.

1059
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.410
Sometimes you win.

1060
01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.865
sometimes you lose.

1061
01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:15.040
It's important not to quit.

1062
01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:16.956
You must not give up.

1063
01:10:17.667 --> 01:10:20.033
You must keep fighting.

1064
01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:24.538
You must keep going even if you get hit.

1065
01:10:26.333 --> 01:10:27.448
If you stay on your feet...

1066
01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:30.198
You have a chance of winning.

1067
01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:35.030
If I win. I'm a champ. right?

1068
01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:36.747
Of course.

1069
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:40.165
Let's win this fight together.

1070
01:10:58.375 --> 01:10:59.330
Here. one more.

1071
01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:00.698
Move... move

1072
01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:02.698
load them to the truck.

1073
01:11:05.417 --> 01:11:08.864
Stop.

1074
01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:10.702
It hurts.

1075
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:12.740
Stop.

1076
01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.573
Stop.

1077
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:21.993
It hurts.

1078
01:11:22.542 --> 01:11:24.203
Stop.

1079
01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.616
The compatibility test results are in.

1080
01:11:30.792 --> 01:11:32.032
I'm sorry.

1081
01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:34.579
You're not a match for your daughter.

1082
01:11:39.917 --> 01:11:42.203
We can only hope...

1083
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:45.120
For a match to turn up.

1084
01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:48.411
Meanwhile...

1085
01:11:48.417 --> 01:11:49.748
You and your family...

1086
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:51.365
Should work to raise funds.

1087
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:52.740
I'm her father.

1088
01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:54.990
How can I not be a match?

1089
01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:58.120
How can a hospital this
big fail to find a match?

1090
01:11:58.458 --> 01:12:00.323
She's just a child.

1091
01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:01.948
She can't endure much more.

1092
01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.198
Doctor. find another way.

1093
01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:04.789
There must be another way.

1094
01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:06.831
Please try?

1095
01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:28.615
I'm zhou shi.

1096
01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:31.289
I would like to meet.

1097
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:37.824
Are you ready to negotiate?

1098
01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:42.370
Blithe has acute lymphocytic leukemia.

1099
01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:44.748
What?

1100
01:12:45.833 --> 01:12:46.833
Blithe...

1101
01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:49.369
Leukemia?

1102
01:12:50.917 --> 01:12:53.374
She needs to find a bone marrow donor.

1103
01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:56.574
She was perfectly fine.

1104
01:12:56.958 --> 01:13:00.075
How come anyone around you gets jinxed?

1105
01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:03.415
You're cursed. zhou shi.

1106
01:13:09.917 --> 01:13:11.578
Where is she now?

1107
01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:13.583
In the hospital.

1108
01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:17.155
Fine. I'll take over from here.

1109
01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:19.578
I'll get her the best treatment.

1110
01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:21.868
However...

1111
01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:24.618
Let's get one thing clear...

1112
01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:26.286
I'm giving up custody

1113
01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:29.248
but you must get her cured.

1114
01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.865
Of course.

1115
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:34.780
Without me. what can you do for her?

1116
01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.866
If it wasn't for me...

1117
01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:39.957
What can you do?

1118
01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:42.119
What can you do for her?

1119
01:13:45.917 --> 01:13:48.374
My lawyer will draft the
agreement for you to sign.

1120
01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:49.740
After that...

1121
01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:53.124
Disappear from our lives.

1122
01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:08.489
Papa.

1123
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.539
I love this Princess wig
that you brought me.

1124
01:14:12.708 --> 01:14:16.451
I'll grow my hair long too.

1125
01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:20.208
Yes.

1126
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:25.413
Blithe.

1127
01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:28.539
Papa also brought this for you.

1128
01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:31.702
Here.

1129
01:14:34.375 --> 01:14:36.206
It's mama's necklace.

1130
01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:46.081
Oh. grandma came to visit the other day.

1131
01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:49.075
She said you asked her to come.

1132
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.208
Blithe.

1133
01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:03.823
I'll be too busy...

1134
01:15:05.125 --> 01:15:06.615
To come visit you.

1135
01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:09.698
It doesn't mean...

1136
01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:12.243
That I don't love you.

1137
01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:15.995
You know papa loves blithe very much.

1138
01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:18.990
I think it's befter...

1139
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.865
If grandma looks after you.

1140
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.332
No! I want papa.

1141
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.244
Papa don't leave me.

1142
01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.949
If grandma comes. I'll chase her away.

1143
01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:32.619
I don't want to see her ever again.

1144
01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:33.910
I just want papa.

1145
01:15:34.625 --> 01:15:36.411
Papa has his own life to live too.

1146
01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:40.165
I can't spend all my
time and energy on you.

1147
01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:44.289
I'm tired...

1148
01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:46.915
Of looking after you everyday.

1149
01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:51.158
I'll get better.

1150
01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:56.991
You won't be tired anymore.

1151
01:15:57.042 --> 01:15:59.704
I promise to be good.

1152
01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:03.789
Because of you...

1153
01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.157
I can't do anything.

1154
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.410
You throw tantrums.

1155
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.241
you're a picky eater.

1156
01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.703
you won't go to bed. you wake up late.

1157
01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:17.199
You're too much trouble.

1158
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.414
I'm sorry.

1159
01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:21.910
Everyday...

1160
01:16:21.917 --> 01:16:23.953
I have to buy food. cook for you...

1161
01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:25.448
Clean your room...

1162
01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:26.823
Put away your toys.

1163
01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:29.449
I can't take it anymore.

1164
01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:31.198
I hate it.

1165
01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:33.665
I'm sorry...

1166
01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:36.158
I've spent a fortune on your treatment.

1167
01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:37.873
I'm broke now.

1168
01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:38.830
I have nothing left.

1169
01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:40.539
Your father is a failure.

1170
01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:41.748
You know?

1171
01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:43.042
I'm sorry.

1172
01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:45.161
I won't be a picky eater.

1173
01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.249
I'll go to bed early.

1174
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:49.411
I'll study.

1175
01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.078
I'll keep my room tidy.

1176
01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.368
I'll get better.

1177
01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.457
Don't leave me.

1178
01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:04.532
Blithe. time to face reality.

1179
01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:09.994
You're lucky grandma still wants you.

1180
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.582
Who else would take you in?

1181
01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:14.577
I can't.

1182
01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:17.823
We'll see each other when you grow up.

1183
01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:21.749
Just focus on getting better.

1184
01:17:23.292 --> 01:17:25.032
Otherwise. you won't see me again.

1185
01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.456
Understand?

1186
01:17:31.875 --> 01:17:33.706
Don't leave me.

1187
01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:35.573
Papa. come back.

1188
01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.828
I'll get better.

1189
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.956
Come back.

1190
01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:42.658
Papa. don't leave me.

1191
01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:56.917
Mr. zhou?

1192
01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:45.782
What can you do for her?

1193
01:18:46.792 --> 01:18:49.033
Really. if it wasn't for me...

1194
01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:50.703
What can you do?

1195
01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:53.036
What can you do for her?

1196
01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:17.782
Blithe has been...

1197
01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:19.328
Making good progress.

1198
01:19:19.708 --> 01:19:22.120
All of her blood test results
are in the normal range.

1199
01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.180
We'll continue our current treatment plan.

1200
01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:25.948
Hope everything goes well. god bless.

1201
01:19:28.542 --> 01:19:29.827
Grandma.

1202
01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:33.701
Will I get better faster in this hospital?

1203
01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:36.449
Can you ask the doctor...

1204
01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:39.325
When I'll be discharged?

1205
01:19:40.083 --> 01:19:41.539
You'll get well soon.

1206
01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:46.450
Just listen to the doctors and nurses.

1207
01:19:52.917 --> 01:19:55.784
Grandma. I want to play games.

1208
01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:57.999
Do you have a phone?

1209
01:20:00.667 --> 01:20:02.407
You want to call someone?

1210
01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:06.124
I told you. I want to play games.

1211
01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:11.539
Naughty girl.

1212
01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:32.125
Hello?

1213
01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:33.413
Papa.

1214
01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:35.160
Blithe.

1215
01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.415
Papa. have you eaten?

1216
01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.578
I miss you so much.

1217
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.206
Papa misses you too.

1218
01:20:48.917 --> 01:20:52.455
Are you mad at papa for yelling at you?

1219
01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:55.786
I know you just wanted me to go...

1220
01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:57.748
With grandma.

1221
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:59.490
You've never yelled at me before.

1222
01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:02.449
Grandma took me to Beijing...

1223
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.540
To a big hospital.

1224
01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:06.664
The people here are nice.

1225
01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:09.199
I behave and take my shots and pills.

1226
01:21:09.708 --> 01:21:11.744
Grandma even found me a tutor...

1227
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:14.082
To help me study.

1228
01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:15.664
Don't worry about me.

1229
01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:17.247
That's good.

1230
01:21:17.667 --> 01:21:19.658
Listen to your grandma.

1231
01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:20.702
Okay?

1232
01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:24.574
I'll get well soon...

1233
01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:25.948
And grow up fast.

1234
01:21:25.958 --> 01:21:29.701
so I can be with papa again.

1235
01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:30.708
Right?

1236
01:21:35.167 --> 01:21:36.167
Yes.

1237
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.491
Blithe will be with papa soon.

1238
01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:45.667
Blithe...

1239
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:51.198
Papa knows that fighting this disease...

1240
01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:52.698
Is painful.

1241
01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:56.704
But remember what papa told you.

1242
01:21:58.083 --> 01:21:59.539
If you endure the punches...

1243
01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:01.407
You can still win.

1244
01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:06.080
You must work hard. okay?

1245
01:22:06.083 --> 01:22:07.289
It's like life.

1246
01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:09.206
No one wins all the time.

1247
01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:12.166
Sometimes you win. sometimes you lose.

1248
01:22:12.167 --> 01:22:14.704
Papa. I'm going to win.

1249
01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:15.993
My papa is a champ.

1250
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.082
I'm a champ's daughter.

1251
01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:20.199
I can punch back. too.

1252
01:22:28.167 --> 01:22:29.167
That's right.

1253
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.740
Blithe is the smartest.

1254
01:22:35.875 --> 01:22:36.875
Papa...

1255
01:22:37.792 --> 01:22:38.952
Will never give up.

1256
01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:43.155
Blithe must never give up. too.

1257
01:22:46.417 --> 01:22:47.532
Blithe.

1258
01:22:50.958 --> 01:22:52.448
Be free and happy.

1259
01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.619
Papa. when I call you next time...

1260
01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:58.616
Pick up quickly.

1261
01:23:04.625 --> 01:23:05.910
I promise you...

1262
01:23:07.042 --> 01:23:09.749
I'll wait by the phone. okay?

1263
01:23:11.125 --> 01:23:11.989
Papa.

1264
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
What is it?

1265
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.706
It's okay.

1266
01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:15.948
Bye. papa.

1267
01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:18.123
Papa.

1268
01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:27.206
I love you too.

1269
01:23:39.458 --> 01:23:41.414
Godard. punch harder.

1270
01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:44.331
Feng.

1271
01:23:47.667 --> 01:23:50.830
I want to return to the
ring and reclaim my title.

1272
01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:22.498
Chairman wang.

1273
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:23.455
Remember me?

1274
01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:24.948
I'm zhou shi's agent.

1275
01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:27.368
Zhou shi...

1276
01:24:27.917 --> 01:24:29.953
He retired 7 years ago.

1277
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:31.250
Can he still fight?

1278
01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:32.580
Of course.

1279
01:24:32.583 --> 01:24:34.869
He's still in good shape.

1280
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.957
His age is his unique selling point.

1281
01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:39.038
You should start...

1282
01:24:39.042 --> 01:24:41.829
With an opponent ranked twentieth...

1283
01:24:41.833 --> 01:24:44.495
Work your way up to the
top 10 over three years.

1284
01:24:46.083 --> 01:24:47.368
I can't wait that long.

1285
01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:49.123
Just 18 months.

1286
01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:52.956
Just one bite.

1287
01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:57.499
You'll have no strength if you don't eat.

1288
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.500
Exactly.

1289
01:24:58.625 --> 01:24:59.410
7 years ago.

1290
01:24:59.417 --> 01:25:01.373
ibf middleweight champion zhou shi...

1291
01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:03.081
Disappeared from public view.

1292
01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:06.250
The wolf just announced his
comeback next month...

1293
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.706
- Papa!
- Against 26-year-old...

1294
01:25:07.708 --> 01:25:10.365
- Why is he on TV?
- Thai champion surachai.

1295
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.740
That's my papa!

1296
01:25:11.792 --> 01:25:13.748
Are you ready?

1297
01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.698
- Papa is amazing!
- Some say...

1298
01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:17.198
You're a has-been.

1299
01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.164
How do you respond?

1300
01:25:19.167 --> 01:25:20.282
Blithe...

1301
01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:22.789
Papa will win.

1302
01:25:23.792 --> 01:25:24.872
Super cool.

1303
01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.536
Let's pray for the wolf...

1304
01:25:26.542 --> 01:25:28.624
After a 7-year hiatus...

1305
01:25:28.625 --> 01:25:30.411
That he won't be slaughtered.

1306
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.740
Papa's got to win!

1307
01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:32.792
Young miss.

1308
01:25:33.125 --> 01:25:34.240
Have a bite.

1309
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:36.832
Grandma. can we go see the match live?

1310
01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:38.073
I want to see papa.

1311
01:25:38.083 --> 01:25:39.118
Only if you eat.

1312
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:40.080
Alright.

1313
01:25:40.083 --> 01:25:41.038
Give me the bowl.

1314
01:25:41.083 --> 01:25:42.573
If it was shi from 7 years ago...

1315
01:25:42.583 --> 01:25:44.494
Surachai would be no match for him.

1316
01:25:44.542 --> 01:25:46.578
But in boxing. youth...

1317
01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:48.331
Is half the battle.

1318
01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.493
The wolf of today is...

1319
01:25:49.542 --> 01:25:52.249
No match for surachai in terms of
strength and stamina.

1320
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:54.536
Welcome to Thailand. ladies and gentlemen.

1321
01:25:54.667 --> 01:25:55.747
It's been a long time...

1322
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.365
But he's finally back...

1323
01:25:57.375 --> 01:26:00.492

Stop!

1329
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:07.865
One...

1330
01:27:09.333 --> 01:27:10.448
Two...

1331
01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:13.743
Three...

1332
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:16.832
Papa. I'm going to win.

1333
01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:18.448
My papa is a champ.

1334
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.115
I'm a champ's daughter.

1335
01:27:20.167 --> 01:27:22.328
I can punch back too.

1340
01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:35.073
Can you continue?

1341

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.657
first comeback fight...

1349
01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:55.907
Has certainly impressed...

1350
01:27:55.917 --> 01:27:57.407
Younger fans...

1351
01:27:57.417 --> 01:27:59.032
Unfamiliar with his attack strategy.

1352
01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:01.790
Can the wolf continue to defy expectations?

1353
01:28:02.417 --> 01:28:04.999
You must take your medication

1354
01:28:05.333 --> 01:28:06.072
and eat more...

1355
01:28:06.083 --> 01:28:12.534

1358
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.697
win after win.
zhou shi has been looking incredible.

1359
01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.073
Moving on to his next challenge

1360
01:28:35.083 --> 01:28:37.324
in London. england...

1361
01:28:39.833 --> 01:28:41.414
I'm not sure if he's...

1362
01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:42.702
The greatest fighter of all time.

1363
01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:43.447
But I guarantee.

1364
01:28:43.458 --> 01:28:45.494
he has the greatest fighting spirit.

1365
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.832

Wow. papa was amazing!

1369
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.456
Igawa yuji...

1370
01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:06.825
If 1 didn't retire from the ring...

1371
01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.949
You wouldn't be the champion.

1372
01:29:10.042 --> 01:29:12.078
I challenge you to a match!

1373
01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:14.907
Beat igawa.

1374
01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:15.917
Alright.

1375
01:29:16.208 --> 01:29:17.948
Enough TV.

1376
01:29:24.542 --> 01:29:27.374
Papa. the doctor said
I've made huge progress.

1377
01:29:27.375 --> 01:29:30.492
I saw you boxing on TV.

1378
01:29:30.875 --> 01:29:34.493
I can see you wherever you fight.

1379
01:29:34.542 --> 01:29:37.955
When I'm well. I'll go see you fight live.

1380
01:29:37.958 --> 01:29:39.494
Papa. keep fighting.

1381
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.957
Papa wants to win the
world championship belt

1382
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:44.368
for you.

1383
01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:48.451
Papa is fighting hard.
blithe must fight too.

1384
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.697
Never give up. let's win
this fight together.

1385
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.740
Yes. papa.

1386
01:30:14.833 --> 01:30:15.833
Faster.

1387
01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:18.208
Again.

1388
01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:20.993
Brother.

1389
01:30:37.458 --> 01:30:39.073
How did you find me?

1390
01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:40.365
I saw you fight.

1391
01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:43.081
It's what you're meant for.

1392
01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:47.073
You deserve to be hit.

1393
01:30:47.083 --> 01:30:48.619
Why didn't you call?

1394
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:50.785
What for?

1395
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:53.490
What for?

1396
01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:54.875
Hey.

1397
01:30:55.333 --> 01:30:56.994
Didn't you announce live...

1398
01:30:57.042 --> 01:30:58.998
You wanted to challenge igawa yuji?

1399
01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:01.869
I'm the only one who can...

1400
01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:04.832
Make this match happen.

1401
01:31:05.625 --> 01:31:06.956
I can guarantee...

1402
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.581
Igawa will agree to the match.

1403
01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:10.250
But...

1404
01:31:10.833 --> 01:31:12.824
If you fight in your current state.

1405
01:31:13.667 --> 01:31:15.328
he'll slaughter you.

1406
01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.208
Two months...

1407
01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:23.368
Give me two months.

1408
01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:24.990
It's no use.

1409
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:27.160
We need to...

1410
01:31:27.458 --> 01:31:29.699
Find the best team to train you.

1411
01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:32.369
I'll take care of it.

1412
01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:39.324
Don't thank me.

1413
01:31:40.875 --> 01:31:43.241
I plan to make a fortune.

1414
01:31:52.958 --> 01:31:56.701
Match of the century
between the former and...

1415
01:31:56.750 --> 01:32:00.447
The current middleweight world champions.

1416
01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:02.244
Igawa San. you're...

1417
01:32:02.292 --> 01:32:05.079
Undefeated with 21 wins and 18 kos.

1418
01:32:06.042 --> 01:32:09.364
Why did you accept zhou shi's challenge?

1419
01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:12.370
What made you come to the decision of...

1420
01:32:12.417 --> 01:32:16.080
Accepting the old champ's challenge?

1421
01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:20.577
Before I turned pro.
I used to watch zhou shi fight...

1422
01:32:20.583 --> 01:32:24.576
And think to myself:

1423
01:32:24.708 --> 01:32:26.494
I can ko him.

1424
01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.824
Within 3 rounds?

1425
01:32:32.708 --> 01:32:34.244
3 punches.

1426
01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:41.155
He doesn't even have the
same killer instinct.

1427
01:32:41.708 --> 01:32:46.452
I despise boxers who fight for show only.

1428
01:32:47.625 --> 01:32:51.368
My agent was lured in by the prize money...

1429
01:32:51.917 --> 01:32:54.624
Otherwise I wouldn't have
agreed to fight him.

1430
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.865
Zhou shi.

1431
01:32:57.917 --> 01:33:01.239
You were once a brash champion yourself.

1432
01:33:01.292 --> 01:33:04.329
Do you have any comment?

1433
01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:11.077
Il... umm

1434
01:33:12.917 --> 01:33:15.454
I want to tell my daughter:

1435
01:33:17.583 --> 01:33:18.948
Papa didn't give up...

1436
01:33:20.167 --> 01:33:21.498
Will never give up.

1437
01:33:23.458 --> 01:33:25.574
Even if life deals you a bad hand...

1438
01:33:26.792 --> 01:33:28.703
You can triumph with
faith and determination.

1439
01:33:29.167 --> 01:33:32.455
I have faith you'll beat the disease

1440
01:33:32.958 --> 01:33:35.620
coz' you're a champ's daughter.

1441
01:34:05.833 --> 01:34:08.620
You may have skill and experience

1442
01:34:10.708 --> 01:34:13.620
but you must change your attack strategy.

1443
01:34:14.875 --> 01:34:17.662
We've analyzed igawa's past bouts.

1444
01:34:17.667 --> 01:34:20.784
He's as good as you were 7 years ago.

1445
01:34:20.792 --> 01:34:23.408
You can't match him in
terms power and stamina.

1446
01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.617
You think you can beat
yourself from 7 years ago?

1447
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:29.036
You need more strength and
conditioning training.

1448
01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:30.998
It's an endurance battle.

1449
01:34:32.042 --> 01:34:34.579
We'll build up your muscle strength quickly

1450
01:34:35.167 --> 01:34:37.374
to counter igawa's attack.

1451
01:34:38.625 --> 01:34:41.207
Imagine you have just one
chance to hit igawa.

1452
01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:42.789
That punch...

1453
01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:45.329
Must pack the force of an oncoming train.

1454
01:35:01.208 --> 01:35:02.744
Faster.

1455
01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.368
Stop.

1456
01:35:15.458 --> 01:35:17.119
Blithe is a good girl.

1457
01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:18.990
No more needles.

1458
01:35:20.917 --> 01:35:22.248
You'll get better in no time.

1459
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.786
Stop.

1460
01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:31.119
It hurts just a little.

1461
01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:32.205
Stop.

1462
01:35:39.708 --> 01:35:41.699
Bear with it.

1463
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.707
Maximize each chance to land a blow...

1464
01:35:52.708 --> 01:35:55.199
Give it the full force of 1000-pound weight

1465
01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:57.244
then a miracle may happen.

1466
01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:14.698
Blithe.

1467
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:17.116
Papa is already in Japan.
preparing for the fight.

1468
01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:18.743
Let's win this fight together.

1469
01:37:40.458 --> 01:37:42.119
Uncle feng. you're here!

1470
01:37:43.917 --> 01:37:45.157
Did you miss me?

1471
01:37:45.167 --> 01:37:46.077
Yes.

1472
01:37:46.083 --> 01:37:47.664
Want to see your father fight in Japan?

1473
01:37:47.667 --> 01:37:48.281
Yes.

1474
01:37:48.292 --> 01:37:51.580
I begged grandma but she won't let me...

1475
01:37:52.375 --> 01:37:53.785
Don't listen to that old hag.

1476
01:37:53.792 --> 01:37:55.908
Uncle will take you.

1477
01:37:55.917 --> 01:37:57.032
Godard...

1478
01:37:57.250 --> 01:37:58.865
What is your status?

1479
01:37:58.917 --> 01:38:00.828
I snuck in posing as a guard.

1480
01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:03.582
I have blithe's passport;
See you at the airport.

1481
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:06.865
You'll meet your father soon. blithe.

1482
01:38:06.917 --> 01:38:08.202
Hurry...

1483
01:38:11.833 --> 01:38:12.948
What are you doing?

1484
01:38:12.958 --> 01:38:14.323
Where are you taking her?

1485
01:38:14.333 --> 01:38:15.823
This is kidnap!

1486
01:38:15.833 --> 01:38:16.948
Who are you?

1487
01:38:17.208 --> 01:38:19.199
Grandma. don't be mad.

1488
01:38:19.625 --> 01:38:21.707
They're papa's friends.

1489
01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:24.491
I want to see papa fight.

1490
01:38:24.542 --> 01:38:26.954
Yell at me if you want.

1491
01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:29.119
Sorry. it's a misunderstanding.

1492
01:38:29.167 --> 01:38:30.077
Misunderstanding?

1493
01:38:30.083 --> 01:38:32.950
I'm warning you... I'll call the police.

1494

If you must go. grandma will take you.

01:43:30.708 --> 01:43:33.120
Shi isn't backing off
despite sustaining many blows.

1579
01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:34.490
Move it... come on!

1580
01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:35.948
He's like ironman...

1581
01:43:35.958 --> 01:43:37.869
Zhou shi doesn't feel pain.

1582
01:43:37.875 --> 01:43:39.285
He just keeps taking the blows.

1583
01:43:39.292 --> 01:43:40.077
Stop!

1584
01:43:40.083 --> 01:43:42.290
- To your corner!
- Igawa is light on his feet.

1585
01:43:42.292 --> 01:43:44.408
By contrast. unlike his formidable foe...

1586
01:43:44.417 --> 01:43:45.998
Zhou shi appears sluggish.

1587
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.956
Zhou shi may be tough as steel.

1588
01:43:50.292 --> 01:43:53.079
but he has yet to land a real blow.

1589
01:43:53.083 --> 01:43:54.539
Ironman zhou shi...

1590
01:43:54.542 --> 01:43:57.534
Has yet to land a substantial blow.

1591
01:43:57.542 --> 01:44:00.204
- Make sure you keep your hands up.
- Good job...

1592
01:44:00.458 --> 01:44:02.574
Look. he's done for.

1593
01:44:02.708 --> 01:44:04.790
Should I go easy on him?

1594
01:44:05.083 --> 01:44:06.823
He won't last long.

1595
01:44:07.333 --> 01:44:09.039
Don't let your guard down.

1596
01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:10.282
I'll be fine.

1597
01:44:10.708 --> 01:44:11.708
Keep your guard up.

1598
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:12.785
Don't let him get close.

1599
01:44:12.792 --> 01:44:14.908
Don't get too comfortable.

1600
01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:17.823
You got this.

1601
01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:18.875

Papa.

1608
01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.948
Hands up! Hands up!

1609
01:45:09.458 --> 01:45:10.458
Stop!

Sit down. relax... that was a good round.

You have to push him back. alright?

1615

Box!

1617
01:45:49.583 --> 01:45:50.789
Get off the ropes.

1618
01:45:56.667 --> 01:45:57.873
Break it up...

1619
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:59.490
Go to your corner.

1620
01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:02.074
Doctor... zhou shi. look at me.

1621
01:46:02.333 --> 01:46:03.448
Head up...

1622
01:46:07.958 --> 01:46:08.743
Zhou. relax.

1623
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:10.331
Compose yourself... take your time.

1624
01:46:10.333 --> 01:46:11.493
Listen to me.

1625
01:46:12.333 --> 01:46:13.539
Hang in there.

1626
01:46:13.542 --> 01:46:14.657
He's dropping his guard.

1627
01:46:14.667 --> 01:46:17.283
W ait for a chance to
land the decisive blow.

1628
01:46:18.042 --> 01:46:19.623
- Is it okay to continue?
- Come on...

1629
01:46:19.708 --> 01:46:22.199

And... box!

Move... move... take your time.

1632
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:45.081
Stop! Break it up!

1633
01:46:45.125 --> 01:46:46.740
Go back to your corner!

1634
01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:03.375
Box!

1635
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.582
Don't meet force with force.

1636
01:47:17.958 --> 01:47:20.700
Igawa's lightning fast jabs
hit the Mark every time.

1637
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:22.206
Zhou shi can barely fight back.

1638
01:47:22.208 --> 01:47:24.620
He's been hit in the face repeatedly.

1639
01:47:24.667 --> 01:47:25.873
Zhou shi is down!

1640
01:47:29.375 --> 01:47:33.072
Look. igawa's lightning blows!

1641
01:47:33.083 --> 01:47:34.198
It's over.

1642
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:36.491
No one can recover from such a blow.

1643
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.740
Come on. zhou shi. get up!

1644
01:47:38.792 --> 01:47:40.703
Get up! Get up!

1645
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Two...

1646
01:47:45.333 --> 01:47:46.333
Three...

1647
01:47:52.208 --> 01:47:53.948
Mom used to say...

1648
01:47:54.583 --> 01:47:58.576
Papa was an awesome boxer.

1649
01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:01.823
He won every single time.

1650
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:04.750
Four...

1651
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.240
Is that true?

1652
01:48:09.958 --> 01:48:10.617
Five...

1653
01:48:10.625 --> 01:48:11.865
Papa.

1654
01:48:12.375 --> 01:48:13.660
Papa.

1655
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:16.115
Papa.

1656
01:48:16.667 --> 01:48:17.531
Six...

1657
01:48:17.542 --> 01:48:20.329
Papa. papa.

1658
01:48:20.875 --> 01:48:24.197
Papa. papa.

1659
01:48:27.833 --> 01:48:28.697
Seven...

1660
01:48:28.833 --> 01:48:29.833
Wow...

1661
01:48:30.583 --> 01:48:33.074
Zhou shi is getting up!

1662
01:48:33.875 --> 01:48:35.866
His determination is incredible.

1663
01:48:35.875 --> 01:48:38.287
Hats off to the wolf.

1664
01:48:38.833 --> 01:48:39.697
Eight...

1665
01:48:39.833 --> 01:48:41.824
Zhou shi is back on his feet.

1666
01:48:41.875 --> 01:48:43.115
He hasn't given up.

1667
01:48:43.167 --> 01:48:44.122
He's still standing!

1668
01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:46.123
What an extraordinary display of will.

1669
01:48:46.375 --> 01:48:48.582
Zhou shi stood back up
before the referee reached 10.

1670
01:48:48.583 --> 01:48:50.289
The boxer has a will of iron.

1671
01:48:51.042 --> 01:48:53.033
Stay here... time...

1672
01:48:53.583 --> 01:48:54.823
Hand me the towel.

1673
01:48:55.417 --> 01:48:57.658
Papa! Papa!

1674
01:48:58.625 --> 01:49:00.741
Keep fighting!

1675
01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:02.956
Get ready... time...

1676
01:49:04.292 --> 01:49:05.292
Box!

1677
01:49:06.833 --> 01:49:08.448
Igawa is growing impatient.

1678
01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:09.743
He attacks shi with a flurry of punches.

1679
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:11.240
He has him on the ropes.

1680
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:14.456
Break it up.

1681
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.661
Zhou shi is struggling.

1682
01:49:19.042 --> 01:49:20.953
Ilgawa's strength and stamina
are on full display.

1683
01:49:20.958 --> 01:49:22.698
He's not even breathing hard.

1684
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:25.456
Break!

1685
01:49:36.083 --> 01:49:39.325
Stop! Igawa. go to your corner.

1686
01:49:42.292 --> 01:49:44.328
Shi. how do you feel?

1687
01:49:44.333 --> 01:49:45.493
Sit down.

1688
01:49:56.458 --> 01:49:57.493
It's okay.

1689
01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.865
Here. drink some water.

1690
01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:01.365
Spit it out.

1691
01:50:02.875 --> 01:50:06.117
He has a death wish... he hits hard though.

1692
01:50:06.375 --> 01:50:08.206
You'll be fine.

1693
01:50:08.208 --> 01:50:10.449
You're winning.

1694
01:50:10.458 --> 01:50:14.326
He's struggling. we'll be fine.

1695
01:50:14.458 --> 01:50:17.780
I didn't expect him to
recover after that punch.

1696
01:50:17.792 --> 01:50:20.829
He's tougher than we thought.

1697
01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:23.115
Finish him off quickly.

1698
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.832
You can't continue.

1699
01:50:25.833 --> 01:50:27.414
You put up a good fight.

1700
01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:29.164
Let's call it quits.

1701
01:50:31.667 --> 01:50:34.739
If you throw in the towel. I'll kill you.

1702
01:50:44.417 --> 01:50:45.873
Come on... let's go!

1703
01:50:46.292 --> 01:50:49.455
Zhou shi's spirit is indomitable.

1704
01:50:50.167 --> 01:50:52.249
I'm amazed he's still standing.

1705
01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:58.039
He's still standing.

1706
01:50:58.042 --> 01:50:59.998
Maybe miracles do happen.

1707
01:52:01.125 --> 01:52:04.447
Stop! Zhou shi. go to the neutral corner.

1708
01:52:05.042 --> 01:52:07.203

Three... four...

1710
01:52:10.833 --> 01:52:12.539
Are you okay? Can you continue?

1711
01:52:12.542 --> 01:52:13.452
Ready...

Stop!

1729
01:53:16.917 --> 01:53:19.829
Zhou shi is down once again.

1730
01:53:19.833 --> 01:53:22.324
That blow was deadly!

1731
01:53:22.333 --> 01:53:24.619
Igawa put his full force behind it...

1732
01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:27.412
It's bound to cause damage.

1733
01:53:27.417 --> 01:53:28.452
Three...

1734
01:53:29.042 --> 01:53:30.202

Both fighters gave it
their best and put on...

1752
01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:38.198
A hell of a show.

1753
01:54:38.917 --> 01:54:43.206
Zhou shi's indomitable
spirit created a miracle.

1754
01:54:43.583 --> 01:54:44.698
King boxer...

Great sportsmanship
displayed by both boxers.

1758
01:54:52.583 --> 01:54:55.199
It truly was spectacular.

1759
01:55:01.083 --> 01:55:09.083
Zhou shi... zhou shi.

1760
01:55:20.708 --> 01:55:24.371
The fighters display tremendous efforts.

1761
01:55:24.375 --> 01:55:27.162
What an amazing 12th rounds of fighting.

1762
01:55:33.917 --> 01:55:41.917
"In the ring. and in life. never give up."

1763
01:55:54.042 --> 01:55:55.157
Ms. zhou.

1764
01:55:55.167 --> 01:55:57.283
you are a best-selling writer.

1765
01:55:57.292 --> 01:55:58.577
What inspired you

1766
01:55:58.583 --> 01:56:00.369
to write about your fight against cancer?

1767
01:56:01.375 --> 01:56:03.081
Specifically. I was inspired by

1768
01:56:03.083 --> 01:56:07.122
what had transpired
between my father and me.

1769
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.197
He taught me to be persevering like him.

1770
01:56:11.208 --> 01:56:12.493
He encouraged me.

1771
01:56:13.083 --> 01:56:15.825
He helped give me a second chance at life.

1772
01:56:16.417 --> 01:56:18.658
which I gladly took.

1773
01:56:19.417 --> 01:56:22.955
He gave me a lifetime supply
of faith and courage.

1774
01:56:22.958 --> 01:56:25.745
enabling me to have overcome my illness.

1775
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.241
Therefore. in my heart...

1776
01:56:30.958 --> 01:56:32.994
Papa will always be a champion.

1777
01:56:34.333 --> 01:56:36.324
Even though he is no longer around

1778
01:56:36.333 --> 01:56:38.244
to read my book.

1779
01:56:38.292 --> 01:56:41.125
there are no longer any regrets

1780
01:56:41.167 --> 01:56:42.828
in either of our lives.

1781
01:56:43.458 --> 01:56:46.120
All I want to tell you. papa.

1782
01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:49.575
is that you won in the end.

1783
01:56:50.083 --> 01:56:52.119
I will live my life to the fullest.
