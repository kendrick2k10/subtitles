3
00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.597
Everything changes.

4
00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.566
It's a fact.

5
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:19.438
Everything is destined
to undergo a change.

6
00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:24.773
We live to take care of our
children. to protect them.

7
00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:27.644
to make sure that they're well.

8
00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.878
We live every day with the
fear that unexpected events

9
00:03:30.913 --> 00:03:33.881
can change our life.

10
00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:38.292
But time. it doesn't stop.

11
00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:40.459
It doesn't wait.

12
00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:42.923
You can't control it.

13
00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:47.961
It's life. a breath. a moment.

14
00:04:10.623 --> 00:04:11.919
Laura?

15
00:04:11.954 --> 00:04:12.788
We better head down.

16
00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:15.021
It's almost dark.

17
00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:15.588
Go ahead.

18
00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:18.695
I'll catch up with you.

19
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.565
I'm heading down with the guys.

20
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.863
Call me when you're on the road.

21
00:04:21.898 --> 00:04:25.438
I'll call you when I'm
back at the lab. Adam.

22
00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.704
Oh. leave everything in the car.

23
00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:31.576
Next week. when we get back.
we need to update and analyze

24
00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:33.380
all the data we need to send.

25
00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:35.481
Get some rest over
the next seven days.

26
00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:37.648
We deserve it. right?

27
00:04:37.683 --> 00:04:39.518
I'm not coming back.

28
00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:41.113
Everything's in my notes.

29
00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:42.917
Your tour is over?

30
00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:44.017
Time flies.

31
00:04:44.052 --> 00:04:44.688
I'll call you.

32
00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:45.326
Be careful.

33
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.397
My name is Laura--

34
00:04:50.432 --> 00:04:51.959
Laura Winslet.

35
00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:53.928
I'm a geologist.

36
00:04:53.963 --> 00:04:57.932
I study the seismic
activity of volcanoes.

37
00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:00.836
When I was a kid. while
I was at school on a day

38
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:05.071
just like any other. an
earthquake rocked our desks.

39
00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:07.645
We looked at each
other. terrified.

40
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.549
Something totally unexpected
had happened from one moment

41
00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:12.584
to another.

42
00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:17.490
Volcanoes. the Earth. time--

43
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:20.625
life is just one of those things
that you just can't predict.

44
00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:47.113
Are you still there?

45
00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:49.181
Adam. I'm almost home.

46
00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:51.920
What do you want. to hear my
dogs barking or something?

47
00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:54.153
I just need to
park and I'm there.

48
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:55.087
All right.

49
00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:58.597
I'm taking my son to
the falls tomorrow.

50
00:05:58.632 --> 00:06:04.097
And if you can get in touch
with me or if you need anything.

51
00:06:04.132 --> 00:06:05.505
just leave me a message.

52
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.934
OK.

53
00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:09.872
Listen. you want to--

54
00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:16.043
go-- jeez.

55
00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:18.210
Mommy. when are you coming?

56
00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:22.148
Grandpa says you're
never coming.

57
00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:24.018
Yeah. you've got
to be here. mommy.

58
00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:26.592
Time for a party.

59
00:06:26.627 --> 00:06:27.087
Press off.

60
00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:35.029
Shit.

61
00:09:25.234 --> 00:09:29.775
The worst never ends.

62
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.780
I've heard it said again
and again. but it's a lie.

63
00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:36.683
There is an end.

64
00:09:36.718 --> 00:09:40.148
And it starts when
you hit the bottom.

65
00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:43.283
I had just fallen.

66
00:09:43.318 --> 00:09:44.889
If you're so sure
that I'm not going

67
00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:47.221
to die because I'm the one
telling you this story.

68
00:09:47.256 --> 00:09:50.994
that's a pretty big assumption.

69
00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:55.229
We'll anticipate what
will happen next.

70
00:09:55.264 --> 00:09:58.034
I had been working
there for 30 days.

71
00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:01.202
I was sure of where I was going.

72
00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:03.908
Nothing could surprise me.

73
00:10:03.943 --> 00:10:05.976
But now I'm here.

74
00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:09.243
I'd made the same mistake again.

75
00:10:09.278 --> 00:10:16.250
I'm sure about tomorrow. but
now what have you fallen into?

76
00:10:18.859 --> 00:10:19.957
Nothing but darkness.

77
00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.114
I know what you're thinking--

78
00:13:30.149 --> 00:13:34.217
scream. look for
help. do something.

79
00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:37.418
I could yell. cry.
get all worked up--

80
00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:39.926
for what?

81
00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:41.488
I just fell in here
a few minutes ago.

82
00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:45.096
but I am already certain
that there's no way out.

83
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:51.057
As with all true
beginnings. everything

84
00:15:51.092 --> 00:15:53.224
starts with you trying
to reach something.

85
00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:59.362
I already know what I won't
find in that backpack--

86
00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:03.729
no ladder. no rope.
nothing that I can

87
00:16:03.764 --> 00:16:05.632
use to pull myself out of here.

88
00:17:57.746 --> 00:18:02.782
A half a liter of water. a
pack of gum. nothing to eat.

89
00:18:05.424 --> 00:18:07.688
The others will be
back in a week--

90
00:18:07.723 --> 00:18:10.691
seven days and eight nights.

91
00:18:10.726 --> 00:18:14.332
I skipped lunch today. damn it.

92
00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:16.829
What kind of shitty situation
did I get myself into?

93
00:21:59.658 --> 00:22:02.461
Mommy. wake up.

94
00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:03.429
Wake up.

95
00:22:06.093 --> 00:22:07.631
Wake up.

96
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.033
Mommy. wake up.

97
00:22:47.904 --> 00:22:52.071
Oh. oh. hi.

98
00:22:55.648 --> 00:22:58.044
Mommy. you remember
what day is today.

99
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.984
It is your birthday.

100
00:23:04.019 --> 00:23:07.053
Happy birthday. sweetheart.

101
00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:07.691
Oh--

102
00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:14.027
Uh-huh.

103
00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:17.569
It's at our house.

104
00:23:25.777 --> 00:23:30.912
That's lovely. fantastic.

105
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.250
Adam called a few times.

106
00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:40.625
I want you to call him back.

107
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:50.030
You're going up to
the volcano. too?

108
00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.702
Yeah. I just--

109
00:23:51.737 --> 00:23:54.639
I have to get some
more soil samples.

110
00:23:54.674 --> 00:23:57.202
I understand. I understand.

111
00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:07.014
Hey. that's a
beautiful palm tree.

112
00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:09.280
And all the flowers
outside the house--

113
00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:10.820
that's beautiful.

114
00:24:10.855 --> 00:24:12.624
You're so clever.

115
00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:14.692
I want to color some in.

116
00:24:14.727 --> 00:24:15.495
Lovely windows--

117
00:24:20.898 --> 00:24:22.227
Just step up here.

118
00:24:22.262 --> 00:24:25.065
You don't-- you can put
my hand right there.

119
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.869
All right.

120
00:24:26.904 --> 00:24:29.267
Here we go.

121
00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:31.137
OK.

122
00:24:31.172 --> 00:24:33.271
OK.

123
00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:35.911
Are you sure you want to wait
until later to open it with me?

124
00:24:35.946 --> 00:24:36.578
Yes.

125
00:24:36.614 --> 00:24:38.749
Don't be late for the party.

126
00:24:38.784 --> 00:24:42.016
I won't be-- can't. I promise.

127
00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:47.857
I'm disappointed. Laura.

128
00:24:47.892 --> 00:24:48.990
That's enough. Dad.

129
00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:53.060
If you can't get
through on my phone.

130
00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:55.865
just send me voice messages.

131
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.671
OK. be careful.

132
00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:07.206
We'll going to have a party.

133
00:25:07.241 --> 00:25:08.339
Yay!

134
00:25:08.374 --> 00:25:08.977
Yay!

135
00:25:15.854 --> 00:25:17.018
Laura. about last night.

136
00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:24.762
You don't have to say anything.

137
00:25:24.797 --> 00:25:27.930
You were drinking.

138
00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:31.032
You weren't yourself.

139
00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:37.973
I know I had a couple of drinks.
but everything I said is true.

140
00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:41.543
I feel the same.

141
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:48.016
Adam. you're my best friend.

142
00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:51.052
We work together.

143
00:25:51.087 --> 00:25:55.320
What happened between us
doesn't change anything.

144
00:25:55.355 --> 00:25:57.058
We're just friends.

145
00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:06.133
You know it's more than that.

146
00:26:06.168 --> 00:26:09.301
I mean. whatever
we do. I feel good.

147
00:26:09.336 --> 00:26:11.204
I want to leave Emily.

148
00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:14.042
I don't love her anymore.

149
00:26:14.077 --> 00:26:15.043
And--

150
00:26:44.305 --> 00:26:46.943
Mommy. when are you?

151
00:26:46.978 --> 00:26:50.683
Grandpa says you're coming.

152
00:26:50.718 --> 00:26:52.344
Yeah. you're got
to be here. mommy.

153
00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:54.346
Time for a party.

154
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:57.822
Press off.

155
00:26:57.857 --> 00:26:59.219
Sweetheart. I'll be home soon.

156
00:28:21.468 --> 00:28:23.776
Have you ever dreamed
your memories?

157
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:24.844
I do it all the time.

158
00:28:24.879 --> 00:28:30.475
It's amazing how real they
seem. but I'm still here

159
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.443
in this shit hole.

160
00:28:37.286 --> 00:28:40.221
Mommy. when are you coming?

161
00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:44.390
Grandpa says you're coming.

162
00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:46.293
Yeah. you're got
to be here. mommy.

163
00:28:46.328 --> 00:28:48.999
Time for a party.

164
00:28:49.034 --> 00:28:50.803
Press off.

165
00:28:50.838 --> 00:28:52.200
I told you a lie. Christine.

166
00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:26.222
I get it.

167
00:31:26.257 --> 00:31:27.960
It doesn't seem
that solid. but it's

168
00:31:27.995 --> 00:31:30.358
the best idea I could think up.

169
00:34:57.534 --> 00:35:07.542
Yes. yes. yes-- no. no. no.

170
00:35:07.577 --> 00:35:09.874
On to my phone.
holding the rope--

171
00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:10.908
help me!

172
00:35:23.692 --> 00:35:26.528
Fuck.

173
00:35:26.563 --> 00:35:27.166
Shit.

174
00:35:51.291 --> 00:35:51.685
Help!

175
00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:09.571
Snakes.

176
00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:49.159
Dad. I don't remember what I
said the last time I saw you.

177
00:38:49.194 --> 00:38:53.702
Sometimes we don't recognize
the really important moments.

178
00:38:53.737 --> 00:38:55.440
They slip away
without knowing we

179
00:38:55.475 --> 00:39:01.941
won't have another opportunity
to go back and say. I'm sorry.

180
00:39:01.976 --> 00:39:05.076
I love you. and thanks.

181
00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:10.785
When I was a little girl.
you always found an answer

182
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.919
to all my questions--

183
00:39:12.954 --> 00:39:16.461
or at least I thought you did.

184
00:39:16.496 --> 00:39:20.696
You probably didn't. but
I couldn't understand it.

185
00:39:20.731 --> 00:39:22.863
I thought that as
a parent. I would

186
00:39:22.898 --> 00:39:25.536
have an answer to everything.

187
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:27.769
I'd like to think so.

188
00:39:27.804 --> 00:39:32.906
Now that I am a parent.
I know that's not true.

189
00:39:32.941 --> 00:39:37.977
There are too many questions.
and new ones never stop coming.

190
00:41:06.034 --> 00:41:08.672
What a way to go--

191
00:41:08.707 --> 00:41:10.839
I never would have guessed it.

192
00:41:10.874 --> 00:41:17.912
The silence. the heat. the cold
at the heart of the volcano--

193
00:41:17.947 --> 00:41:21.146
ending my days in
total agony down here.

194
00:41:21.181 --> 00:41:28.021
I wouldn't wish it upon anybody.
but it's happening to me.

195
00:41:28.056 --> 00:41:30.155
It's like one of those
stories you see in a film

196
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.862
or you hear people talk about.

197
00:41:33.897 --> 00:41:36.799
How long can her body
keep going without eating.

198
00:41:36.834 --> 00:41:40.132
without drinking. in
conditions like this?

199
00:41:47.108 --> 00:41:49.614
I may end up
drinking my pee soon.

200
00:41:49.649 --> 00:41:53.651
because my water is
going to run out.

201
00:41:53.686 --> 00:41:56.214
Yeah. it's something I've
heard of plenty of times.

202
00:41:56.249 --> 00:41:59.184
but I would never
think of doing it.

203
00:43:49.901 --> 00:43:53.199
Hey Laura. it's me.

204
00:43:53.234 --> 00:43:54.904
Call me-- bye.

205
00:45:20.959 --> 00:45:23.322
I'm sorry I'm late. princess.

206
00:45:23.357 --> 00:45:25.159
OK. mommy.

207
00:45:25.194 --> 00:45:27.964
I'm going to go help
Grandpa with the cake. OK?

208
00:45:27.999 --> 00:45:29.394
I want to stay with you.

209
00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:30.065
Oh. I know.

210
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.429
Me too. sweetie.

211
00:45:31.464 --> 00:45:32.697
You know what?

212
00:45:32.732 --> 00:45:35.400
Why don't you go play with the
others. and I'll be right back.

213
00:45:35.435 --> 00:45:36.467
OK. Mommy.

214
00:45:36.502 --> 00:45:37.105
OK.

215
00:46:26.453 --> 00:46:27.892
Thank you. dad.

216
00:46:55.053 --> 00:46:57.548
Christine. Christine.
come here--

217
00:46:57.583 --> 00:46:59.616
it's OK. it's OK.

218
00:46:59.651 --> 00:47:00.518
Come here. breathe.

219
00:47:00.553 --> 00:47:02.190
Mommy's here. OK?

220
00:47:02.225 --> 00:47:03.191
Breathe.

221
00:47:03.226 --> 00:47:09.197
One. two. three. breathe.

222
00:47:09.232 --> 00:47:15.137
One. two. three. breathe.

223
00:47:15.172 --> 00:47:19.108
One. two. three. breathe.

224
00:47:22.113 --> 00:47:26.115
One. two. three. breathe.

225
00:48:44.063 --> 00:48:48.593
Mommy. finish-- I'm better
now. Mommy. all better.

226
00:48:48.628 --> 00:48:50.496
You are better.

227
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:52.267
Every night. you
and mommy are going

228
00:48:52.302 --> 00:48:55.171
to do these exercises so
we can get better together.

229
00:48:55.206 --> 00:48:57.041
OK?

230
00:48:57.076 --> 00:48:59.274
Mommy. we never opened the gift.

231
00:48:59.309 --> 00:49:02.145
Oh. you're right. honey.

232
00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:02.739
Let's open it.

233
00:49:17.558 --> 00:49:18.656
Who is this?

234
00:49:18.691 --> 00:49:19.998
What's her name?

235
00:49:22.596 --> 00:49:27.170
She is a geologist.
just like mommy.

236
00:49:27.205 --> 00:49:32.043
and her name is Clarissa.

237
00:49:32.078 --> 00:49:33.407
Clarissa.

238
00:49:33.442 --> 00:49:35.178
Yeah.

239
00:49:35.213 --> 00:49:37.114
She goes to study the soil.

240
00:49:37.149 --> 00:49:39.512
And she comes right
back home. because she

241
00:49:39.547 --> 00:49:41.679
knows her daughter
is waiting for her.

242
00:51:27.358 --> 00:51:28.621
It's all right.

243
00:51:32.198 --> 00:51:33.197
It's like Christine.

244
00:51:37.962 --> 00:51:40.600
Mommy's not like Clarissa.

245
00:51:40.635 --> 00:51:42.173
Mommy's always late.

246
00:51:46.344 --> 00:51:53.514
Why can't-- your mommy's
not a good mother.

247
00:52:13.305 --> 00:52:19.243
Oh. god-- help!

248
00:52:22.776 --> 00:52:23.511
Help me!

249
00:52:25.878 --> 00:52:26.481
Help!

250
00:52:29.882 --> 00:52:31.222
Is anybody there!

251
00:52:33.952 --> 00:52:34.654
Help me out.

252
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:35.721
I'm down here!

253
00:54:16.857 --> 00:54:21.728
One. two. three. breathe.

254
00:54:21.763 --> 00:54:26.997
One. two. three. breathe.

255
00:54:27.032 --> 00:54:31.903
One. two. three. breathe.

256
00:54:31.938 --> 00:54:36.776
One. two. three. breathe.

257
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:40.582
One. two. three. breathe.

258
00:54:43.785 --> 00:54:51.560
Breathe-- one. two.
three. breathe.

259
00:54:51.595 --> 00:54:53.529
One--

260
00:55:54.988 --> 00:55:55.822
It's not the heat.

261
00:55:58.662 --> 00:56:01.729
It's not the hunger.

262
00:56:01.764 --> 00:56:04.897
It's the silence.

263
00:56:04.932 --> 00:56:08.439
The silence is destroying
my eardrums. my mind.

264
00:56:10.971 --> 00:56:14.071
The black rocks
all around me. all

265
00:56:14.106 --> 00:56:20.176
of my screams. all of my
pleas for help are sucked up.

266
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:24.455
And I'm stuck here alone.
and nobody will ever find me.

267
00:56:26.855 --> 00:56:28.789
Nobody will ever know
what's happening to me.

268
00:56:31.662 --> 00:56:35.499
They'll think I ran
off because of my life.

269
00:56:35.534 --> 00:56:38.964
Adam didn't get the message.

270
00:56:38.999 --> 00:56:42.506
No one will find me.

271
00:56:42.541 --> 00:56:46.807
I have to get myself
out of here. but how?

272
00:56:56.753 --> 00:56:58.082
Laura?

273
00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:10.621
Sorry. pal.

274
00:59:10.656 --> 00:59:12.117
You're right.

275
00:59:12.152 --> 00:59:14.856
I'm the one that
barged into your house.

276
00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:15.957
but I didn't mean to.

277
00:59:15.992 --> 00:59:20.389
And if you come close again.
I'll have to kill you.

278
00:59:20.424 --> 00:59:23.161
It's just a question
of survival.

279
00:59:23.196 --> 00:59:24.261
It's nothing personal.

280
01:00:37.105 --> 01:00:37.804
I'm sorry.

281
01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:39.303
You caught me at
a bad time. man.

282
01:00:43.078 --> 01:00:44.275
What is it?

283
01:00:47.412 --> 01:00:50.721
They're checking the areas.

284
01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:52.987
It's been three days
without any news.

285
01:00:57.356 --> 01:00:58.289
I won't go there.

286
01:01:01.162 --> 01:01:04.999
I'm sorry. but I won't.

287
01:01:47.978 --> 01:01:49.912
Think of something. Laura.

288
01:01:49.947 --> 01:01:50.341
Think.

289
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:58.954
Look at us.

290
01:01:58.989 --> 01:02:02.254
We put work before
everything. and now what?

291
01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:09.492
Now. we're all alone.

292
01:02:09.527 --> 01:02:10.427
I know.

293
01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:20.074
I'm a lousy mother.

294
01:02:25.884 --> 01:02:27.048
What's the point in going on?

295
01:02:31.857 --> 01:02:34.418
Maybe being down here is the
best thing that could happen.

296
01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:44.395
You're right.

297
01:02:47.136 --> 01:02:52.975
I should probably just let go.

298
01:02:55.914 --> 01:02:57.309
Give up hope.

299
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:07.957
Do it. Laura.

300
01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:08.551
Do it.

301
01:03:14.262 --> 01:03:18.330
A demon seen-- no.

302
01:03:18.365 --> 01:03:22.268
Just my lack of a will to
live telling me what to do.

303
01:03:22.303 --> 01:03:23.973
That can be sweet--

304
01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:26.437
another way of solving
all your problems.

305
01:03:26.472 --> 01:03:28.274
Is that what you want. Laura?

306
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:32.542
Do you really want to
throw in the towel and die?

307
01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:33.076
OK. ready?

308
01:03:33.111 --> 01:03:34.577
We can do it again.

309
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.517
OK. so--

310
01:05:44.313 --> 01:05:44.712
Good morning.

311
01:05:44.747 --> 01:05:47.083
Good morning.

312
01:05:47.118 --> 01:05:49.448
I'm Nick Winslet. her father.

313
01:05:49.483 --> 01:05:50.614
When news is there?

314
01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:53.221
Hey. bud.

315
01:05:58.129 --> 01:05:59.328
Unfortunately. no.

316
01:05:59.364 --> 01:06:02.098
We are doing everything we can.
but that area is very large.

317
01:06:02.133 --> 01:06:04.793
How long can she survive?

318
01:06:07.402 --> 01:06:09.798
We're putting all
efforts in the search.

319
01:06:27.785 --> 01:06:29.323
Where are you. Laura?

320
01:06:34.363 --> 01:06:36.693
Where-- where are you?

321
01:07:31.222 --> 01:07:34.190
My leg doesn't hurt as bad.

322
01:07:34.225 --> 01:07:37.259
I don't know if
that's a good thing.

323
01:07:37.294 --> 01:07:38.524
I'm hungry.

324
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:41.824
I'm trying not to drink.
but I'm so thirsty.

325
01:07:41.859 --> 01:07:45.465
I have two swallows of water
left. and then that's it.

326
01:08:31.711 --> 01:08:33.876
I feel so weak.

327
01:08:33.911 --> 01:08:35.746
I can't make it.

328
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:36.912
I just can't.

329
01:10:14.352 --> 01:10:16.847
Am I really managing
to climb out?

330
01:10:16.882 --> 01:10:20.851
I'm going to fall and really
hurt myself this time.

331
01:10:20.886 --> 01:10:22.985
I have no strength left.

332
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.054
I've never been able to
get where I want to go.

333
01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:28.023
but now I want to get
to that damn backpack

334
01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:32.599
so I can rest up
there. catch my breath.

335
01:10:32.634 --> 01:10:34.370
and try and keep climbing.

336
01:12:55.139 --> 01:12:56.743
Laura. can you hear me?

337
01:13:05.688 --> 01:13:06.082
Help!

338
01:13:17.634 --> 01:13:21.097
My leg is broken. I can't move.

339
01:13:21.132 --> 01:13:26.003
Just relax. I'll pull you out.

340
01:13:26.038 --> 01:13:29.743
It hurts like hell.

341
01:13:56.706 --> 01:14:01.236
If you hadn't shown up.
I'd have died down there.

342
01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:06.516
You saved my life.

343
01:14:06.551 --> 01:14:07.748
You held out for four days.

344
01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:16.218
You would have made it
out of there without me.

345
01:14:16.253 --> 01:14:16.889
You're wrong.

346
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:22.125
I would have died down
there if it weren't for you.

347
01:14:40.013 --> 01:14:43.553
You figured as much. right?

348
01:14:43.588 --> 01:14:45.148
It's too easy to
dream that someone

349
01:14:45.183 --> 01:14:48.987
stretches out their hand to you
and pulls you out of trouble.

350
01:14:49.022 --> 01:14:50.824
It'd be too sweet--

351
01:14:50.859 --> 01:14:54.256
too easy to fix
everything like that.

352
01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:57.567
This time. I really
have to drag myself out

353
01:14:57.602 --> 01:15:00.999
of this mess on my own.

354
01:15:01.034 --> 01:15:03.232
I don't want to let
you down. Christine.

355
01:15:03.267 --> 01:15:06.642
but Mommy is really tired.

356
01:15:06.677 --> 01:15:08.908
I know I disappointed
you. and that you're

357
01:15:08.943 --> 01:15:12.615
sure Mommy can get out of
here without any problems--

358
01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:15.145
just like your Clarissa.

359
01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.116
But I don't have any
strength left. my love.

360
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:23.087
I just can't make
it out of this hole.

361
01:15:23.122 --> 01:15:26.123
It's swallowed me up--

362
01:15:26.158 --> 01:15:27.597
doesn't want to let me go.

363
01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:08.902
Dad-- Dad. listen. I want
to tell you something.

364
01:17:04.025 --> 01:17:06.190
Oh. Christine.

365
01:17:06.225 --> 01:17:07.730
It's Mommy.

366
01:17:11.197 --> 01:17:14.968
Just so you know.
I won't be late.

367
01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:16.002
I'm on my way.

368
01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:34.284
Christine. Christine.
Christine--

369
01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:40.895
Talking down here. saying
my daughter's name--

370
01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:43.799
it helps me feel better.

371
01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:46.769
It makes me feel at peace.

372
01:17:46.804 --> 01:17:53.204
Dad. Christine-- naming the
people you love most in life

373
01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:57.274
can bring you relief. it's true.

374
01:17:57.309 --> 01:18:01.916
In this place.
there's a choked echo.

375
01:18:01.951 --> 01:18:07.053
For a split second. I can hear
my voice bounce back to me.

376
01:18:07.088 --> 01:18:09.990
just as if it were
speaking to me.

377
01:18:10.025 --> 01:18:12.487
I'm not alone.

378
01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:12.887
Laura--

379
01:18:12.923 --> 01:18:13.862
With myself.

380
01:18:16.999 --> 01:18:18.163
Laura. come on.

381
01:18:22.268 --> 01:18:24.169
Laura. get up.

382
01:18:24.204 --> 01:18:24.840
Get up.

383
01:18:27.471 --> 01:18:29.339
Christine's waiting for you.

384
01:18:49.064 --> 01:18:51.097
You won't disappoint her again.

385
01:20:36.138 --> 01:20:37.137
¦

386
01:27:29.881 --> 01:27:30.484
OK.

387
01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:56.642
Now what?

388
01:27:56.677 --> 01:27:59.579
Now you're there. halfway
between the bottom

389
01:27:59.614 --> 01:28:01.009
and the exit.

390
01:28:01.044 --> 01:28:03.385
Nobody's going to pull you out.

391
01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:06.355
You have no idea how
to do it yourself.

392
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:10.854
I can try to balance
myself. shimmy out.

393
01:28:10.889 --> 01:28:12.592
My legs won't hold.

394
01:28:12.627 --> 01:28:15.892
If I fall this time. the
risk of cracking my skull

395
01:28:15.927 --> 01:28:18.829
and bleeding to death
is almost a sure thing.

396
01:28:18.864 --> 01:28:20.963
My friend down there
would be happy.

397
01:28:20.998 --> 01:28:22.536
He'd have food to eat for weeks.

398
01:28:36.453 --> 01:28:39.850
The sun is covered.

399
01:28:39.885 --> 01:28:42.523
Don't faint. Laura.

400
01:28:42.558 --> 01:28:44.558
Don't faint. or you won't
make it back up again.

401
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.598
I'm exhausted.

402
01:28:51.633 --> 01:28:53.160
Being up here makes
me feel safer.

403
01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:56.834
but I have no strength left.

404
01:28:56.869 --> 01:29:00.739
I'm far away from that snake.
which might be harmless anyway.

405
01:29:00.774 --> 01:29:03.808
but I've never been
crazy about snakes.

406
01:29:45.951 --> 01:29:46.884
I have to drink.

407
01:29:52.023 --> 01:29:59.061
Adam. you're a good man. and
Emily deserves your love.

408
01:29:59.096 --> 01:30:03.868
It's clear we have something
special between us. I just--

409
01:30:03.903 --> 01:30:05.100
I don't want to ruin that.

410
01:30:10.943 --> 01:30:17.178
If you're still in love with
Eric. I'll stop insisting.

411
01:30:17.213 --> 01:30:18.652
I don't know what else to say.

412
01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.495
Adam. we're just friends.

413
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:31.797
That's all I need.

414
01:30:31.832 --> 01:30:34.195
OK. whatever you want.

415
01:30:40.577 --> 01:30:45.272
This is how Laura Winslet comes
to an end and makes her exit.

416
01:30:45.307 --> 01:30:52.081
Adam. he's a good man.
he makes me feel good.

417
01:30:52.116 --> 01:30:54.688
But he's married.

418
01:30:54.723 --> 01:30:55.920
He's my friend.

419
01:30:55.955 --> 01:31:00.155
Friendship isn't
love. right. Laura?

420
01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:03.796
Why am I thinking about him now?

421
01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:06.128
They say that before you die.
you think of the people that

422
01:31:06.163 --> 01:31:11.705
are most important to you.
the ones you'll miss the most.

423
01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.542
He's one of them.

424
01:31:40.769 --> 01:31:42.197
I have to get down from here.

425
01:31:44.971 --> 01:31:46.234
What time is it?

426
01:33:34.146 --> 01:33:36.949
No-- no news yet.

427
01:33:36.984 --> 01:33:39.314
OK. Adam.

428
01:33:39.349 --> 01:33:41.690
So we'll talk tomorrow?

429
01:33:41.725 --> 01:33:42.119
I'm sorry.

430
01:34:34.503 --> 01:34:35.106
Laura!

431
01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:48.790
I will find you. Laura.

432
01:34:48.825 --> 01:34:51.188
I will find you.

433
01:38:15.328 --> 01:38:15.931
Dad?

434
01:38:34.644 --> 01:38:36.050
I've been calling you nonstop.

435
01:38:39.154 --> 01:38:40.087
Why don't you answer?

436
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:55.201
I'm not going anywhere.

437
01:40:13.809 --> 01:40:15.842
Perhaps dying in this
hole is a way to end

438
01:40:15.877 --> 01:40:21.749
the suffering. a predictable
way to end it all.

439
01:40:21.784 --> 01:40:25.423
But something inside
me says that this

440
01:40:25.458 --> 01:40:28.624
can't be the last chapter.

441
01:40:28.659 --> 01:40:31.198
Something tells me that
I have to keep on living.

442
01:40:35.369 --> 01:40:37.567
Not for my daughter--

443
01:40:37.602 --> 01:40:39.800
she's gone.

444
01:40:39.835 --> 01:40:49.117
Not for my father. not
for Adam. for myself.

445
01:40:49.152 --> 01:40:51.812
I have to do it for myself.

446
01:40:51.847 --> 01:40:52.379
.

447
01:40:52.414 --> 01:40:54.419
Mommy when are coming?

448
01:40:54.454 --> 01:40:58.588
Grandpa says that you're coming.

449
01:40:58.623 --> 01:41:01.294
Nobody's going to
pull me out of here.

450
01:41:01.329 --> 01:41:05.496
Only I can do it. if I
really want to do it.

451
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:11.799
Only I can find the strength
inside me to fight back.

452
01:41:11.834 --> 01:41:14.340
I have to live--

453
01:41:14.375 --> 01:41:16.408
I want to live.

454
01:43:37.815 --> 01:43:42.015
Healing from a wound that does
not want to heal takes time.

455
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:46.327
Healing can be slow. very slow.

456
01:43:46.362 --> 01:43:50.826
Months can pass.
sometimes even years.

457
01:43:50.861 --> 01:43:55.369
But in the end. even after
the deepest darkness.

458
01:43:55.404 --> 01:43:58.306
the sun always rises again.

459
01:43:58.341 --> 01:44:02.838
And I start to breathe
again. aware that something

460
01:44:02.873 --> 01:44:05.313
has changed in me--

461
01:44:05.348 --> 01:44:08.580
completely. forever.
