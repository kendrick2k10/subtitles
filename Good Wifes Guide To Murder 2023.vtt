00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:35.140
Do you have anything else
planned for me today?

6
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.309
Well. if you'd just
listened to me.

7
00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.520
I don't need you to manage me.

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.942

Here you go.

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.362
You deserve it.

14
00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.655
About time. right?

15
00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:37.535
Hm.

Help! My husband.
isn't breathing!

27
00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:23.290
[Kate]Okay. murder junkies.
What did she do wrong?

28
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.832
Intentional allergy attack.

29
00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.877
Well. I guess the classics
never go out of style.

30
00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:30.672
But. honey. throwing out
the murder weapon

31
00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.131
at the scene of the crime?

32
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.300
Hmm. should've known better.

33
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.429
Now. let's look
at my top ten rules.

34
00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:38.930
Number one. make a plan.

35
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.973
Okay. I'll give her that.

36
00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:42.684
But she really
flubbed the number two.

37
00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.727
"Appearances are everything."

38
00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:48.399
Her and her husband were seen
bickering by neighbors...

39
00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:49.524
No alibi. rule five.

40
00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:53.195
But I guess she did try
to hide the murder weapon.

41
00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:55.989
she just didn't do it
very well.

42
00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.532
Bad girl!

43
00:02:57.532 --> 00:03:00.493
[scoffs] Now. the police were
on to her right away.

44
00:03:00.493 --> 00:03:04.415
And she was combative.
not cooperating.

45
00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:05.665
And her best friend

46
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:11.629
gave an interview that
spilt all of her secrets.

47
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.757
Hey. lady. you gotta keep
your friends close

48
00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:17.844
and you got to control
the narrative.

49
00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:20.389
Some "best friend"
you got there.

50
00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.932
And that is how
her case was solved.

51
00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:27.229
so learn from
her mistakes. people.

52
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.689
Now. this wraps up today's case.

53
00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.695
And a reminder... my first
true crime docu-series

54
00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:36.863
starts streaming soon.

55
00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:39.283
And it will be filled
with tales

56
00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:40.783
of marriage and mayhem.

63
00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.222
[Kate] Gotcha!
[Matt] Oh-oh!

64
00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.351
[chuckling] You scared me.

65
00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:08.353
[chuckles] Okay. well.
next time.

66
00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:11.022
I'll announce my arrival
with a bullhorn.

67
00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:13.400
-Or some flares?
-Oh!

68
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.404
Mmm. are you making that...
blackberry IPA again this year?

69
00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:20.615
You bet. I know how crazy you
went for it last year.

70
00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:22.284
Hm-hm.

71
00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:23.659
Mmm.

72
00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:26.497
What time are Peter and Lenore
coming over?

73
00:04:26.497 --> 00:04:30.292
6:00. I think. Though.
she might have to work late.

74
00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:35.464
Hmm. What do you think
about kiwi? Mango?

75
00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:37.131
You could do a entire
fruit theme.

76
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:39.967
Oh. yeah? Taking advantage
of Massachusetts'

77
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:41.010
lush mango orchards?

78
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.349
[scoffs] You never take my
suggestions seriously.

79
00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.185
I'm the craft brewer. you're the
producer/influencer.

80
00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:51.813
-Let's stay in our lanes.
-Huh.

81
00:04:56.485 --> 00:05:00.029
[solemn music]

82
00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:07.579
See. how it's more of a twist?

83
00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:08.955
We're not making
toothpaste. babe.

84
00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.206
Doesn't have to
be complete mush.

85
00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:12.584
Oh. thank God
we're not making toothpaste.

86
00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:16.295
-Could you imagine green teeth?
-You'd still be gorgeous.

87
00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:17.589
[Kate chuckles]

88
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.757
-Hey.
-Hey.

89
00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:21.217
The station was crazy today.

90
00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:23.970
And since I've been
promoted to sergeant.

91
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.180
the paperwork never ends.

92
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.432
I just wanted to drop this off

93
00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:28.975
before I head next
door to change.

94
00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:31.978
I'm making your favorite.
rack of lamb.

95
00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:33.480
Uh... Kate.

96
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.273
You told me
to bring chardonnay.

97
00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:38.360
Oh. well. I thought
we were having salmon.

98
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.486
-Lenore hates fish.
-Okay.

99
00:05:39.486 --> 00:05:42.364
Well. just leave it on the
counter and we'll get to it.

100
00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:44.657
-All right.
-Thank you.

101
00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:48.703
Where's Peter?

102
00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:51.164
-Oh. he's out for his run.
-Ah.

103
00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:53.625
Lunch break weights.
6:00 p.m. run.

104
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.502
I thought he might
take a night off.

105
00:05:55.502 --> 00:05:57.421
but Peter's a machine.

106
00:05:57.421 --> 00:05:58.671
That reminds me.
I need to call the bar.

107
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:01.257
make sure Lisa and Javier
have it all under control.

108
00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:02.842
No. It's games night.

109
00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:04.218
You need to learn
to trust your staff.

110
00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:08.973
and let them run Mendaville
for one night.

111
00:06:13.853 --> 00:06:16.022
Okay. fine. You. go get changed.

112
00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:19.443
You... you get one text.

113
00:06:23.863 --> 00:06:24.489
Hmm.

114
00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:28.159
What's the plan for this
year's couples vacation?

115
00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:33.206
Some of us have press
tours to plan around.

116
00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:34.957
What are you thinking?

117
00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:38.044
-Hawaii.
-Kate. honey...

118
00:06:38.044 --> 00:06:39.045
No. it-it'll be great.

119
00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:40.589
There's this local beer tour
for you.

120
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:41.839
Lenore will get
her fill of nature.

121
00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:45.927
Peter and I can lay on the beach
and hit up the hotel spa.

122
00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:47.803
Everyone will be happy.

123
00:06:47.803 --> 00:06:50.056
[Peter] But Hawaii is
so expensive.

124
00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:52.476
And. uh. I don't think
it's a good time

125
00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:54.686
for me to be away
from the firm right now.

126
00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:57.481
Yeah. work is pretty busy
for me too. Kate.

127
00:06:57.481 --> 00:07:00.399
Okay. well. it doesn't
have to be now. It could be...

128
00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.695
um. in a month
or for the holidays?

129
00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:05.697
I think. we should wait.

130
00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:08.241
It's just...

131
00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:10.743
not the right time.

132
00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:16.082
Okay. vacation talk
is tabled... for now.

133
00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:19.752
[instrumental music]

134
00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.713
[door opens]

135
00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:22.755
Garrett?

136
00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:24.591
-[Garrett] In the office!
-I picked up coffee.

137
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.969
-How's my favorite client?
-I'm not sure you need this.

138
00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.514
Gimme. You excited for our
sleepover tonight?

139
00:07:30.514 --> 00:07:34.183
Yes. But I'm not sure how much
you gonna be sleeping.

140
00:07:34.183 --> 00:07:35.434
Are you vibrating?

141
00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:37.019
[both chuckle]

142
00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:38.730
How's the schedule looking?

143
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.733
-I just emailed you the latest.
-Oh.

144
00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:46.237
-Garrett.
-What?

145
00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.905
This is not what
we discussed.

146
00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:51.660
We're leveling up so you can
become an international brand.

147
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.327
That means lots of press.

148
00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:55.580
It all starts with
this first docuseries.

149
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.916
We need big numbers.
binging. ravenous fans

150
00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:00.627
who need more content
from you.

151
00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:04.922
And then it's T-shirts.
movie deals. you name it.

152
00:08:04.922 --> 00:08:08.510
Okay. look. I love that
you're so ambitious.

153
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.344
And I love that you
believe in me.

154
00:08:10.344 --> 00:08:12.054
That is why I signed
with you.

155
00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:14.932
But. uh. Matt and I have an
agreement.

156
00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:15.891
We put our marriage first.

157
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.729
and we don't spend more
than a week apart.

158
00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:21.690
Ugh. fine.
he can come with us.

159
00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:24.275
He has a brewery to run.

160
00:08:24.817 --> 00:08:27.320
What? This schedule
is a thing of beauty.

161
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.823
It took me weeks to
finalize everything.

162
00:08:34.703 --> 00:08:37.997
Fine. I'll make adjustments.

163
00:08:37.997 --> 00:08:40.124
Thank you. I love you.

164
00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:42.043
I love you right back.

165
00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.462
Okay. so.
AM Boston tomorrow...

166
00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:46.088
What are you going to wear?

167
00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:48.257
I don't know.
It's a radio interview.

168
00:08:48.257 --> 00:08:49.050
So...

169
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.384
When has that ever mattered?

170
00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:52.136
[both chuckle]

171
00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:53.597
[birds chirping]

172
00:08:53.597 --> 00:08:54.806
[instrumental music]

173
00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:57.224
[door opens]

174
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.938
Oh. Are these the new creations?

175
00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:05.149
I just siphoned them
from the fermenter.

176
00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:06.735
It's not kiwi or mango.
but you definitely

177
00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:10.071
got me thinking about using
local fruit more often.

178
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:11.864
Hmm...

179
00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:13.199
These are amazing.

180
00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:13.908
[laughs]

181
00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:16.911
So what time's the AM Boston
interview tomorrow?

182
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:19.914
It's at 6:00. but I have
to be there at 5:15.

183
00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:22.124
You sure you want to sleep
at Garrett's tonight?

184
00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:24.669
Yeah. it's easier. It saves me
the drive in the morning.

185
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:28.590
I have tomorrow off. I could
drive you while you chug coffee.

186
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.548
[chuckles]

187
00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:32.761
No. you should sleep in
for once.

188
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:34.887
Besides. don't you have
all this work to do

189
00:09:34.887 --> 00:09:37.390
on Mendaville. the Sequel?

190
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.894
What? You used to talk about a
second location all the time.

191
00:09:41.894 --> 00:09:44.731
You were-you were scouting
places in New York. Boston.

192
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:46.982
I can't find a space that
I love. and I don't want to

193
00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:50.027
get trapped in somewhere
that's not perfect.

194
00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.445
You know. market is
so saturated right now.

195
00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:54.323
everyone and their mother's
making craft beer.

196
00:09:54.323 --> 00:09:55.908
I don't know.

197
00:09:58.703 --> 00:10:03.750
First you shut down about
Hawaii. now... now this.

198
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.126
-Are you okay?
-Stress. bills.

199
00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:09.046
State of the world. destruction
of the planet. the usual.

200
00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:10.131
Okay. well. if money is tight.

201
00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:12.425
you can always dip into
the docuseries cash.

202
00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:15.887
-I don't want to do that.
-Why not?

203
00:10:15.887 --> 00:10:17.930
That's your money.

204
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.432
Matt. what's mine is yours.

205
00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:22.017
-We're. we're partners.
-I know that.

206
00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:23.394
But you've worked so hard
for that money.

207
00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:25.938
I don't want to toss it away on
a venture that could fail.

208
00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:30.234
It won't! You-you... You're
building your busine--

209
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:32.486
I don't want to do it. okay?

210
00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:35.448
[tense music]

211
00:10:37.074 --> 00:10:40.369
Look. I'm stressed out and
I shouldn't take it out on you.

212
00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:42.747
But our deal with Stayaway
Hotels fell through and I have

213
00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:46.250
all this extra product
that I can't move...

214
00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.044
it's a bit of a mess
right now.

215
00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:53.382
It did?
Why. why didn't you tell me?

216
00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:55.844
I was embarrassed.

217
00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:58.889
People are upset and I'm the
boss. I take the blame.

218
00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:01.850
I get it. but you have to
tell me these things.

219
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.810
We've-we've talked
about this.

220
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.562
You don't have to remind me.

221
00:11:09.482 --> 00:11:12.736
You know. maybe this press tour
will be good for us.

222
00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:16.155
Some space.

223
00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:20.326
Okay.

224
00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:24.873
Right. um...
Well. I should pack.

225
00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:30.419
[sighs]

226
00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:34.089
[somber music]

227
00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.674
Hey...

228
00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:41.013
You...

229
00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:43.641
You never say you're
sorry after a fight.

230
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:46.560
It's because I know
you know I'm sorry.

231
00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:50.022
It would still be nice
to hear.

232
00:12:00.909 --> 00:12:02.243
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:04.871
I love you more than anything.

234
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.413
I love you.

235
00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:09.751
Knock 'em dead.

236
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.754
I always do.

237
00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:24.849
-[Kate] Hi. Peter.
-Hey. Kate.

238
00:12:25.683 --> 00:12:27.268
Have a good interview tomorrow.

239
00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:29.938
Thank you. Have a good night.

240
00:12:33.024 --> 00:12:37.695
[Cornelius]Good morning. Today.
I'm joined by Kate Kelsey

241
00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:42.575
from the popular channel
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder."

242
00:12:42.575 --> 00:12:44.869
-Kate. welcome.
-Thank you.

243
00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:46.078
I am thrilled to be here.

244
00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:51.083
You exclusively focus on
tales of mariticide.

245
00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:53.920
How did you hone in on that?

246
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.587
Husband murder?

247
00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:59.091
That has a little bit more
flare in the MMO.

248
00:12:59.091 --> 00:12:59.926
MMO?

249
00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:02.053
Motive. Means. Opportunity.

250
00:13:02.053 --> 00:13:05.389
It's the. uh. the basis
of every investigation.

251
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:10.519
And with husband murder. the
motive is usually can be juicy.

252
00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.815
Revenge. jealousy. power. money.

253
00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:17.068
[laughs] We're going to
take a short break.

254
00:13:17.068 --> 00:13:21.113
We'll return with more
from Kate Kelsey.

255
00:13:21.113 --> 00:13:23.198
This is AM Boston.

256
00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:27.202
Kate. this is my assistant.
Brit.

257
00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:29.956
-[Cornelius] She's a fan.
-Ms. Kelsey. Kate.

258
00:13:29.956 --> 00:13:33.250
Ahh! This is so amazing.
I am obsessed with you.

259
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.503
I never miss your show.
And I always leave a comment.

260
00:13:36.503 --> 00:13:38.965
I once left a suggestion
about the woman

261
00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:41.550
who strangled her husband
with Christmas lights?

262
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.552
Oh. I-I think
I remember that one.

263
00:13:43.552 --> 00:13:45.471
-Really? Oh. my goodness.
-Hm-hm.

264
00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:48.223
I mean there are so many
murder shows out there.

265
00:13:48.223 --> 00:13:49.934
but yours is so special.

266
00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:52.020
It's darkly sarcastic.

267
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.899
Thank you for watching. I hope
you check out the new series.

268
00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:58.359
So. have you ever thought about
starting your own channel?

269
00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:01.528
Oh. my God. Yes! I want to be
doing what you doing.

270
00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:04.239
I'm just waiting for an
inspiration. you know?

271
00:14:04.239 --> 00:14:05.282
[Cornelius] We're up in ten.

272
00:14:05.282 --> 00:14:07.743
Well. I am sure it will strike.

273
00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:10.496
Good luck. Brit. Slay safe.

274
00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:11.998
[exclaims]

275
00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:17.169
[instrumental music]

276
00:14:26.012 --> 00:14:27.388
Hm.

277
00:14:30.516 --> 00:14:32.060
-[Peter] Hey.
-Hey.

278
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.106
-So. how was your interview?
-I killed.

279
00:14:36.563 --> 00:14:37.481
Is Matt home?

280
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:39.109
Ah. he should be.
It's his day off.

281
00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:42.361
I texted him last night.
He never replied.

282
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.405
Huh? It's weird.

283
00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:48.701
Um. you wanna come in
and grab a coffee?

284
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:51.996
-I. ah. I need a boost.
-Sure.

285
00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:54.331
I-I'll get that.

286
00:14:59.253 --> 00:15:00.504
Matt?

287
00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:04.050
-Where do you want it?
-Um. anywhere's good.

288
00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.553
Matt?

289
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.473
-Kate. Stay there.
-What?

290
00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:13.101
Just don't...

291
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.519
[Kate] Matt! Matt!

292
00:15:15.686 --> 00:15:18.355
No. no. no. No. don't.

293
00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:20.733
Matt! Matt!

294
00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:22.860
[crying] Matt!

295
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.820
[sobbing]

296
00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:28.323
Call 911.

297
00:15:29.366 --> 00:15:30.659
[Peter] Hello. emergency.

298
00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:33.037
Yeah. there's been an accident.

299
00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:37.708
[Kate crying]

300
00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:41.087
[tense music]

301
00:15:41.087 --> 00:15:42.005
[Kate sniffling]

302
00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:45.549
[Kate whimpering]

303
00:15:51.055 --> 00:15:54.391
[crying]

304
00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:59.063
[indistinct radio chatter]

305
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:10.741
It's okay to lay back
on this one. sarg.

306
00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:15.038
[tense music]

307
00:16:18.499 --> 00:16:19.875
No.

308
00:16:22.503 --> 00:16:24.963
I'm gonna need to take her
down to the station

309
00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:26.632
and decide.

310
00:16:26.632 --> 00:16:30.178
[Kate sobbing]

311
00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:35.432
[music continues]

312
00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:39.812
[crying]

313
00:16:42.648 --> 00:16:46.194
[Kate sobbing]

314
00:16:49.404 --> 00:16:51.032
[Diggs]You were in Boston
last night

315
00:16:51.032 --> 00:16:53.159
at the home of Garrett Lucas?

316
00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:54.743
[Kate]My agent. Yeah.

317
00:16:54.743 --> 00:16:56.453
What time did you leave?

318
00:16:56.453 --> 00:16:59.165
Look. it makes sense that
I'm your prime suspect.

319
00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:03.502
uh... you should always
look at the wife.

320
00:17:03.502 --> 00:17:05.003
But. um...

321
00:17:05.337 --> 00:17:07.464
we have to figure out
who did this.

322
00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:10.093
We have to. so...

323
00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:12.761
[sighs] Um...

324
00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:15.139
I left around 6:00.

325
00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:17.641
I know that because I saw Peter
on his nightly run.

326
00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:21.062
But you should check with him
to confirm that.

327
00:17:21.353 --> 00:17:24.523
What time did you get back
to the house today?

328
00:17:24.523 --> 00:17:26.567
It's a blur. Um...

329
00:17:27.235 --> 00:17:28.861
Noon maybe?

330
00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:31.738
That's pretty big window.
Anybody see you last night?

331
00:17:31.738 --> 00:17:33.365
Well. Garrett can confirm
that I was

332
00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:37.452
at his house last night.
and I left this morning.

333
00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:41.332
You just produced a show about
women who kill their husbands

334
00:17:41.332 --> 00:17:42.916
and get away with it.

335
00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:45.419
True crime is a popular genre.

336
00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:48.172
-Did you and Matt get along?
-[Kate] Of course.

337
00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.715
Any disagreements lately?

338
00:17:49.715 --> 00:17:54.220
-Not really.
-I'll take that as a "yes."

339
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.639
Married couples squabble
from time to time.

340
00:17:57.639 --> 00:18:00.017
Squabble?
So there was a fight.

341
00:18:00.017 --> 00:18:00.934
I don't know...

342
00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:02.936
I don't know
if you could call it a fight.

343
00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:07.608
I think lot of people
were mad at Matt and. um...

344
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.527
he took it out on me.

345
00:18:10.736 --> 00:18:14.698
But he apologized
immediately and...

346
00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:17.368
[whimpering]

347
00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:20.579
-Right on cue.
-What?

348
00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.956
The tears. You're doing
a very good job

349
00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:24.125
of playing a bereaved wife.

350
00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:28.754
My husband was just murdered.
How do you like me to act?

351
00:18:31.006 --> 00:18:32.591
Where's Lenore?

352
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.178
Hm.

353
00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:42.517
[door opens]

354
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:50.943
You were out there
the whole time?

355
00:18:50.943 --> 00:18:52.362
Kate.

356
00:18:53.028 --> 00:18:54.238
You think I did this?

357
00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:56.031
Sweetie. when word gets out.
the whole

358
00:18:56.031 --> 00:18:58.159
world will think
you did this.

359
00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.535
Don't call me "sweetie."

360
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.081
[Lenore] Look...

361
00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:04.790
just...

362
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.210
tell me what happened.

363
00:19:14.132 --> 00:19:15.509
[sighs]

364
00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:19.972
Did you confirm with the agent?

365
00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:23.725
Yeah. And he corroborated
her alibi.

366
00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:26.270
There's CCTV footage of her
arriving in the evening.

367
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.646
and leaving the next morning.

368
00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:30.816
So she leaves the victim
at 6:00 p.m. That's 18 hours.

369
00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:32.276
She could have
found the back door.

370
00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:33.860
she could avoid
the cameras completely.

371
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.487
She's not the type.
A few days ago

372
00:19:35.487 --> 00:19:38.865
she was planning their vacation.
a trip to Hawaii.

373
00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:41.827
Still. Her channel?

374
00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:44.955
She's our number one suspect.

375
00:19:45.373 --> 00:19:48.750
I'm telling you.
she wouldn't do this.

376
00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:51.920
There's no way she could have.

377
00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:54.840
You're too close to this one.

378
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.052
She's your friend and you're not
thinking like a detective.

379
00:19:59.052 --> 00:19:59.886
I'm a sergeant now.

380
00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:01.930
Speaking of.
where were you last night?

381
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.434
I mean. you're right next door.
did you see anything.

382
00:20:04.434 --> 00:20:05.476
did you hear anything?

383
00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:10.063
I was on shift.
Got home around 1:00 a.m.

384
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.941
Peter?

385
00:20:12.941 --> 00:20:15.527
Yeah. He was out late. too.
No idea where.

386
00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:18.905
He tells me less
and less these days.

387
00:20:18.905 --> 00:20:20.283
Hm.

388
00:20:23.286 --> 00:20:25.329
You think she's innocent.

389
00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:27.248
I think she's guilty.

390
00:20:27.248 --> 00:20:28.874
We did always work best
when one of us

391
00:20:28.874 --> 00:20:31.626
was trying to prove
the other wrong.

392
00:20:32.627 --> 00:20:33.920
Diggs...

393
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.131
Let me run lead on this.

394
00:20:36.131 --> 00:20:39.760
Please. I can do this.
Trust me.

395
00:20:42.596 --> 00:20:46.016
The precinct won't survive
another scandal.

396
00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:49.395
No mistakes this time.

397
00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:51.563
There will be consequences.

398
00:20:51.563 --> 00:20:57.986
Unlike you. I know all
about consequences... partner.

399
00:20:57.986 --> 00:21:00.113
[Garrett] What's going on here?

400
00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:02.283
-Garrett?
-Hi. Lenore.

401
00:21:02.283 --> 00:21:03.867
Where's Kate?
Are you charging her?

402
00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:06.912
It's Sergeant Thompson.
And not yet.

403
00:21:06.912 --> 00:21:11.501
Great. I'm her agent and
her lawyer. We're leaving.

404
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:14.961
Tell me you didn't
answer any questions.

405
00:21:15.338 --> 00:21:16.506
-Well. I--
-Uh.

406
00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:17.839
I'm your lawyer.
so starting now

407
00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.592
you don't speak
to anyone without me.

408
00:21:20.592 --> 00:21:22.135
[sighs] This story
is blowing up.

409
00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:24.930
I've been getting interview
requests all day.

410
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.390
and not just local news.

411
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.934
This is big! Huh!

412
00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:30.143
No bad press. right?

413
00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:33.564
I-I can't even think about
that right now.

414
00:21:33.564 --> 00:21:35.399
Right. Of course.

415
00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:39.570
What do you want to do?
Whatever you need.

416
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.738
Well. I. um...

417
00:21:41.738 --> 00:21:42.948
I can't go back to the house.

418
00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:45.326
They. they said
they'd tell me when. but...

419
00:21:45.326 --> 00:21:49.037
We'll go to my place. You can
stay as long as you want.

420
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:54.668
This all feels like a bad dream.

421
00:21:55.252 --> 00:21:58.339
He's. uh... he's really gone.

422
00:21:59.507 --> 00:22:03.469
I... I don't know what to do.

423
00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:07.222
Oh. hon. Come here.

424
00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:09.141
Oh.

425
00:22:09.475 --> 00:22:12.894
You know what always helps me
get through stuff?

426
00:22:12.894 --> 00:22:13.437
What?

427
00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:17.107
Writing everything down.
It's therapeutic.

428
00:22:17.107 --> 00:22:20.652
Plus. later... you can use it.

429
00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:23.697
-Use it?
-You know...

430
00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:26.741
-It's material. Right?
-Garrett...

431
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:30.704
I love you. but can you please
stop being my agent.

432
00:22:30.704 --> 00:22:33.206
and just start being my friend?

433
00:22:33.206 --> 00:22:35.292
Oh. my God. Of course.

434
00:22:35.292 --> 00:22:36.668
[sighs] My bad.

435
00:22:36.668 --> 00:22:38.753
[chuckles]

436
00:22:38.753 --> 00:22:40.130
Whoops!

437
00:22:43.216 --> 00:22:46.596
[Javier] Hey. Kate.
How you holding up?

438
00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:48.598
Javier. Lisa.

439
00:22:48.598 --> 00:22:52.225
Thank you so much for
setting all this up.

440
00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:54.769
Anything for Matt. And you.

441
00:22:55.979 --> 00:22:57.814
He was a genius.

442
00:22:57.814 --> 00:23:01.985
His energy.
his brewing expertise...

443
00:23:02.612 --> 00:23:04.279
[sighs]

444
00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.656
is gone.

445
00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:07.240
Is gone.

446
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.783
I can't believe it's gone!

447
00:23:08.783 --> 00:23:14.206
I'm sorry. Kate. this-this
must be so hard for-for you.

448
00:23:18.043 --> 00:23:18.877
It's not just Matt.

449
00:23:18.877 --> 00:23:22.465
We're both a little on edge
about the future.

450
00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:23.507
Inventory sitting on shelves.

451
00:23:23.507 --> 00:23:24.966
ingredients rotting
in the fridge.

452
00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:27.470
We're thinking about
reopening later this week.

453
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.431
reduced hours.
if that's okay?

454
00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:32.098
Um...

455
00:23:32.098 --> 00:23:34.267
You own the building now. Kate.

456
00:23:35.268 --> 00:23:38.021
Right. Right. Um...

457
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:39.856
Sure. Javier. I trust you.

458
00:23:39.856 --> 00:23:41.816
I don't want Mendaville
to close.

459
00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:47.906
This was. uh. Matt's dream.
and I want to keep it alive.

460
00:23:51.535 --> 00:23:55.330
He shouldn't have said anything.
It's not the right time.

461
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.584
Why the hell is that
detective here?

462
00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:00.794
Oh. it's a... it's an open wake.

463
00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:05.924
We. we figured. everyone
deserved to. ah...

464
00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:06.634
to mourn Matt.

465
00:24:06.634 --> 00:24:11.221
He's not mourning.
He's trawling for suspects.

466
00:24:12.013 --> 00:24:14.140
-He is?
-Uh...

467
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.059
-I'll go talk to him.
-Yeah.

468
00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:18.479
That's not protocol.

469
00:24:21.314 --> 00:24:23.609
I'm gonna go grab a drink.
You okay?

470
00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:25.777
-Yeah.
-All right.

471
00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.657
[Garrett] Any idea where those
two were that night?

472
00:24:29.657 --> 00:24:32.200
-What?
-Well. they knew Matt.

473
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.995
[Garrett] He didn't smash
his own head in with a...

474
00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:37.122
Wait. what was the weapon?

475
00:24:37.122 --> 00:24:39.625
The police don't know yet.

476
00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:42.836
Oh. Um...

477
00:24:42.836 --> 00:24:44.755
-Hi. Uh...
-Brit.

478
00:24:44.755 --> 00:24:47.966
I am so honored that
you remembered me.

479
00:24:47.966 --> 00:24:49.175
I'm so sorry for your loss.

480
00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:51.011
Do you work for the police
or something?

481
00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:51.970
I totally should.

482
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.181
The local PD had a press
conference this morning.

483
00:24:55.181 --> 00:24:57.560
Matt was fatally struck
by a blunt object.

484
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.562
But. at the moment.
no such object

485
00:24:59.562 --> 00:25:01.564
has been recovered
from the crime scene.

486
00:25:01.564 --> 00:25:06.026
Which means. the killer
either hid it. or kept it.

487
00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:09.780
-Who are you?
-You must be Garrett.

488
00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:12.616
I'm looking
for representation.

489
00:25:12.616 --> 00:25:16.537
Uh... She works with
Cornelius Boothe at AM Boston.

490
00:25:16.537 --> 00:25:20.332
Not anymore. I quit.
To start my own podcast.

491
00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:21.833
or web series.

492
00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:23.084
I don't know yet.

493
00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:24.294
Oh. I. I thought you were

494
00:25:24.294 --> 00:25:25.588
waiting for the right
inspiration.

495
00:25:25.588 --> 00:25:29.049
And I found it. Famous wife.
murdered husband.

496
00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:32.302
small suburb where everyone
has a secret.

497
00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:34.846
-It's perfect.
-Uh...

498
00:25:34.846 --> 00:25:38.016
And I def want your perspective.
but not yet.

499
00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:39.100
I'm laying the ground work.

500
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.188
outlining the crime scene.
analyzing the suspects.

501
00:25:43.188 --> 00:25:46.650
And. of course.
I'm using your Top Ten.

502
00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:51.154
Oh. Is that Lenore?

503
00:25:51.863 --> 00:25:53.865
And Peter?

504
00:25:55.576 --> 00:25:57.327
Okay. tell me you're not
letting that little

505
00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:58.286
Eve Harrington scoop you?

506
00:25:58.286 --> 00:26:00.455
[Kate] Okay. I have better
things on my mind

507
00:26:00.455 --> 00:26:02.248
than getting scooped.

508
00:26:02.248 --> 00:26:05.543
I've been in denial.

509
00:26:05.543 --> 00:26:07.504
Someone killed Matt.

510
00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:12.092
In my house.
Probably someone he knows.

511
00:26:13.468 --> 00:26:14.678
[Kate sighs]

512
00:26:14.678 --> 00:26:16.471
They're probably here.

513
00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:18.473
And I'm the number one suspect.

514
00:26:18.473 --> 00:26:19.516
[Garrett] Wonder why that is?

515
00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:21.017
If detective Diggs
is focused on me.

516
00:26:21.017 --> 00:26:23.604
then no one is looking
for the right killer.

517
00:26:23.604 --> 00:26:25.313
No one's trying to
figure out why.

518
00:26:25.313 --> 00:26:28.233
Well. Matt could be
a bit of an ass.

519
00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:30.151
Half this town
probably wanted him dead

520
00:26:30.151 --> 00:26:32.278
for one reason or another.

521
00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:36.157
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
why I said that.

522
00:26:36.157 --> 00:26:40.036
Oh! This is what happens
when I skip breakfast.

523
00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:43.581
[tense music]

524
00:26:49.337 --> 00:26:51.005
I'm making a coffee run.
You want?

525
00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:53.550
Uh. yeah. The usual.

526
00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:06.020
[sighs]

527
00:27:07.522 --> 00:27:11.067
[tense music]

528
00:27:37.469 --> 00:27:40.597
[music continues]

529
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.516
[Garrett] What are you doing?

530
00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:50.565
Matt went to
Littlefield Central. too.

531
00:27:50.565 --> 00:27:52.442
You... you never mentioned.

532
00:27:52.442 --> 00:27:55.278
Did you know him in school?

533
00:27:58.615 --> 00:28:01.117
Why is this page ripped?

534
00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:05.330
It was covered with slurs.

535
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.041
I didn't want my mom to see it.

536
00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:11.169
Who would do that?

537
00:28:13.463 --> 00:28:14.464
No.

538
00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:16.007
[Garrett scoffs]

539
00:28:16.508 --> 00:28:17.968
It was mostly just name-calling.

540
00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:22.013
But there was always the threat
of something worse.

541
00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:25.225
Matt was your high school bully?

542
00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:28.186
Why didn't you ever tell me?

543
00:28:28.186 --> 00:28:32.190
I only realized it
after I signed you as a client.

544
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.902
Of course. he didn't
remember me at all.

545
00:28:35.068 --> 00:28:39.239
I stupidly thought he might
actually apologize someday.

546
00:28:40.573 --> 00:28:44.787
Yeah. He was never really
good at saying sorry.

547
00:28:48.874 --> 00:28:51.709
Y-you're were holding a grudge.

548
00:28:52.753 --> 00:28:54.797
That's a motive.

549
00:28:55.005 --> 00:28:57.215
Kate. don't be an idiot.

550
00:28:57.215 --> 00:29:00.343
You're my favorite client.
My friend.

551
00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:04.097
And let's be honest.
he wasn't good enough for you.

552
00:29:05.933 --> 00:29:09.853
I'm not sorry he's dead.
But I did not kill Matt.

553
00:29:09.853 --> 00:29:12.982
He was still alive
when I left the house.

554
00:29:15.108 --> 00:29:17.903
When were you at my house?

555
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.115
I was in the area.
so I popped by to see

556
00:29:22.115 --> 00:29:24.117
if Kate wanted a ride
into the city.

557
00:29:24.117 --> 00:29:27.161
-[Diggs] Did you see Matt?
-Yes. He answered the door.

558
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:29.706
And told me Kate had
already left.

559
00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:31.249
What time was this?

560
00:29:31.249 --> 00:29:34.377
7:00. I think. I had tickets
to a play in Boston.

561
00:29:34.377 --> 00:29:38.131
-Curtain at 8:30.
-Can anyone corroborate this?

562
00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:40.174
My boyfriend was in the car.

563
00:29:41.384 --> 00:29:44.805
So you were the last person
to see Matt alive.

564
00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:45.889
[chuckles]

565
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:48.433
Other than the killer.
of course.

566
00:29:48.934 --> 00:29:51.144
Why didn't you mention
this earlier?

567
00:29:51.144 --> 00:29:55.024
No one asked.
Am I supposed to do your job?

568
00:29:55.189 --> 00:29:57.400
-You didn't like Matt.
-[Garrett] Is that a crime?

569
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.404
Maybe you went back later that
night. settle an old score.

570
00:30:01.654 --> 00:30:04.324
I went to pick up Kate.
She wasn't there. so I left.

571
00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:07.368
Look. I should have given
a statement earlier.

572
00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:09.245
but I've been focused on Kate.

573
00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:11.999
She's my best friend.
and my client.

574
00:30:11.999 --> 00:30:15.710
and she's heartbroken
over Matt's death.

575
00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:20.715
So you think Kate's innocent?

576
00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:22.425
Without a doubt.

577
00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:23.927
In fact...

578
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.804
I think she's in danger.

579
00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:30.808
Okay. Thanks for the update.

580
00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:32.310
Yeah. Bye.

581
00:30:33.937 --> 00:30:35.355
-Well?
-It checks out.

582
00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:39.068
Garrett and his boyfriend
are on camera at the theater.

583
00:30:39.068 --> 00:30:40.110
Well. that doesn't prove much.

584
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.614
Kate could've doubled back.
killed Matt after 7:00 p.m.

585
00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:46.240
I'm not ruling anything out.

586
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.160
but you have to build
your case. detective.

587
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.372
The case would be a lot easier
if we had the murder weapon.

588
00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:55.208
-Or Matt's phone.
-[scoffs]

589
00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.794
Well. we've done more with less.

590
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.923
That's one of Kate's rules.
you know.

591
00:31:00.923 --> 00:31:03.174
To hide the murder weapon.
Maybe the missing phone.

592
00:31:03.174 --> 00:31:05.385
It's her trying to control
the narrative.

593
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:09.222
Hiding the weapon
is every murderer's rule.

594
00:31:10.223 --> 00:31:11.599
[sighs]

595
00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:14.352
What about the letters?

596
00:31:21.192 --> 00:31:24.529
Hey. Kate. could I see you
for a second?

597
00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:26.739
Yeah.

598
00:31:31.577 --> 00:31:33.329
[Lenore] Could you tell
us about these?

599
00:31:33.329 --> 00:31:35.832
All of Kate's fan mail
comes to my address.

600
00:31:35.832 --> 00:31:38.626
These have been showing
up for a few months.

601
00:31:38.626 --> 00:31:40.921
Months?
Why didn't you tell me?

602
00:31:40.921 --> 00:31:41.964
I didn't want you to be upset.

603
00:31:41.964 --> 00:31:45.591
So. you really don't know
where these are from?

604
00:31:48.219 --> 00:31:50.180
Wait a minute.

605
00:31:54.684 --> 00:31:56.227
[Kate sighs]

606
00:31:57.687 --> 00:31:59.647
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

607
00:32:00.773 --> 00:32:02.900
[Diggs] Yeah. we can track
the postmark.

608
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.861
What if someone was
looking for me?

609
00:32:04.861 --> 00:32:07.156
If Garrett has been getting
these for months.

610
00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:09.615
and suddenly they
show up at my house...

611
00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:12.452
Yeah. your channel does
make you a target.

612
00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:14.871
You never mentioned Matt
in your show.

613
00:32:14.871 --> 00:32:19.084
but you do call yourself
a "good wife."

614
00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:21.627
I could help you.
We should work together.

615
00:32:21.627 --> 00:32:24.922
Leave the police work to us.
stay out of the way.

616
00:32:24.922 --> 00:32:27.300
And I wanna ask you
some more questions.

617
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.220
Oh. more questions.

618
00:32:30.762 --> 00:32:32.181
Great.

619
00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:38.519
This refines the timeline.
right?

620
00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:41.231
Thank you for convincing
Garrett to come in.

621
00:32:41.231 --> 00:32:42.732
But I can't answer that.

622
00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:44.734
This is an active investigation.

623
00:32:44.734 --> 00:32:48.279
[tense music]

624
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.660
You good?

625
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.809
[music continues]

626
00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:25.025
You like the fruity ones. right?

627
00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:27.277
Yeah.

628
00:33:27.693 --> 00:33:29.570
Strawberry ale.

629
00:33:30.738 --> 00:33:33.158
Thanks. Javier. Um...

630
00:33:33.158 --> 00:33:34.367
Is. is Lisa around?

631
00:33:34.367 --> 00:33:36.494
Yeah. she's in the stock room.
Why? What's up?

632
00:33:36.494 --> 00:33:40.414
I just was wondering if Matt
happen to have. I don't know.

633
00:33:40.414 --> 00:33:43.835
any disgruntled customers.
fired workers?

634
00:33:43.835 --> 00:33:46.420
I know you were already
questioned by Detective Diggs.

635
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.298
but I need to find
my own answers.

636
00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:52.760
[sighs] Yeah. Matt pretty much
got along with everyone.

637
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.638
He was the boss.
so. maybe that's why.

638
00:33:55.847 --> 00:33:59.059
Can you make sure these are
cold before Happy Hour?

639
00:34:02.187 --> 00:34:05.648
He and Lisa got into it
sometimes.

640
00:34:06.191 --> 00:34:07.984
Really? How so?

641
00:34:09.236 --> 00:34:10.736
Lisa is ambitious.

642
00:34:10.736 --> 00:34:11.946
She wants to take
our craft brews.

643
00:34:11.946 --> 00:34:15.950
partner with one of the big
brands. distribute nationally.

644
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.661
There were some rumors
about her and Matt...

645
00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:22.623
what she'd be willing to trade
for a title bump.

646
00:34:22.623 --> 00:34:23.208
[scoffs]

647
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:24.417
[Javier] It's just gossip.

648
00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:26.836
They would stay late.
work on brew recipes.

649
00:34:26.836 --> 00:34:30.215
They would fight and banter.
and then later

650
00:34:30.215 --> 00:34:33.718
all the tension would be...
gone.

651
00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:37.638
-[man 2] Hey. Javier.
-Just give me a sec.

652
00:34:39.974 --> 00:34:42.311
You shouldn't be here.

653
00:34:43.103 --> 00:34:46.480
-I. I own the place.
-Go.

654
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.649
So. Lisa.
Matt and her fought.

655
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:50.818
I thought bartenders were
supposed to be tight-lipped.

656
00:34:50.818 --> 00:34:53.654
-Does she have an alibi?
-I'm following up on Lisa.

657
00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:55.865
I'm following up on
all the potential suspects.

658
00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:58.910
But. when the husband of the
woman who makes a living

659
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.496
talking about dead husbands
shows up murdered...

660
00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:04.291
I do have a hard time believing
that as a coincidence.

661
00:35:04.291 --> 00:35:06.584
I want justice for Matt.
I'm going to find his killer.

662
00:35:06.584 --> 00:35:09.129
And if you keep up with
your side investigation.

663
00:35:09.129 --> 00:35:11.422
you're gonna find yourself
for an obstruction

664
00:35:11.422 --> 00:35:12.924
of justice charge.

665
00:35:12.924 --> 00:35:15.302
Better than a murder charge.

666
00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:18.471
[sighs]

667
00:35:22.058 --> 00:35:25.395
Look. what about a. uh...

668
00:35:25.395 --> 00:35:27.605
a peace offering?

669
00:35:29.316 --> 00:35:31.276
Matt...

670
00:35:31.276 --> 00:35:33.861
had an apartment upstairs.

671
00:35:34.363 --> 00:35:35.863
We can look at it together.

672
00:35:35.863 --> 00:35:41.452
Or I can look at it.
and you can wait for a warrant.

673
00:35:50.212 --> 00:35:53.047
[Diggs]
So. this is Matt's man cave?

674
00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:57.260
When's the last time
someone was here?

675
00:35:57.802 --> 00:35:59.388
I don't know.

676
00:35:59.637 --> 00:36:01.764
Well. I need you to stay
where I can see you.

677
00:36:01.764 --> 00:36:04.309
and do not touch anything.

678
00:36:05.768 --> 00:36:09.522
This place is a mess.
Matt was a real neat freak.

679
00:36:09.522 --> 00:36:10.273
-Really?
-Hm.

680
00:36:10.273 --> 00:36:13.109
[Diggs] Seems like he might not
have been alone.

681
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:16.529
That. that doesn't
prove anything. Matt wouldn't...

682
00:36:19.073 --> 00:36:20.658
What's in here?

683
00:36:20.658 --> 00:36:22.618
[Kate] Uh. I don't know.

684
00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:24.745
Let's find out.

685
00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:28.916
What the hell!

686
00:36:29.834 --> 00:36:31.378
[Diggs] Hm.

687
00:36:35.923 --> 00:36:38.175
Tell me. that's not yours?

688
00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:40.594
Of course. not. It's...

689
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:49.229
Matt had late nights.

690
00:36:49.229 --> 00:36:52.648
And he had early morning
deliveries.

691
00:36:52.648 --> 00:36:55.901
"That's the beer business."
That's what he said.

692
00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:57.903
And I...

693
00:36:57.903 --> 00:37:01.615
I was worried about him
driving home tired.

694
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.035
[scoffs]

695
00:37:04.035 --> 00:37:05.370
[mellow music]

696
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.787
Sure.

697
00:37:07.163 --> 00:37:09.832
I'm gonna get a team in here.

698
00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:13.669
Were you aware...

699
00:37:13.669 --> 00:37:15.422
Matt was having an affair?

700
00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:19.133
I've never seen any of those
things before.

701
00:37:19.133 --> 00:37:21.010
I. uh...

702
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.927
[sighs]

703
00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:24.555
I didn't know my husband.

704
00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:32.355
[pensive music]

705
00:37:36.485 --> 00:37:38.611
-Kate.
-Hi. Lisa.

706
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:41.364
Yeah. if I won't talk to the
police. why would I talk to you?

707
00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:45.868
-Did you sleep with my husband?
-I have somewhere to be.

708
00:37:45.868 --> 00:37:46.952
All your theatrics at the wake.

709
00:37:46.952 --> 00:37:50.290
The sobbing.
The calling him a "genius..."

710
00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.124
-He was a genius.
-Yeah.

711
00:37:52.124 --> 00:37:54.877
I found your little
sex toy trunk.

712
00:37:54.877 --> 00:37:57.171
-Oh. you think that was mine?
-Yeah.

713
00:37:57.171 --> 00:38:01.634
As if I'd ever be caught dead
in a pleather G-string .

714
00:38:04.887 --> 00:38:06.597
We flirted at work and sexted.

715
00:38:06.597 --> 00:38:10.017
He sent me photos.
so I sent some back.

716
00:38:10.017 --> 00:38:10.976
We never had sex. I swear.

717
00:38:10.976 --> 00:38:14.523
Those toys must have been
for his other flings.

718
00:38:15.189 --> 00:38:18.776
He was my boss. Kate.
What was I supposed to do?

719
00:38:19.361 --> 00:38:21.153
Well. that sounds
like harassment.

720
00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:24.533
Did he... Was it unwanted?

721
00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:27.369
I wanted a promotion.

722
00:38:27.536 --> 00:38:30.287
To have more input in the brews
and the business.

723
00:38:30.287 --> 00:38:32.623
And it seemed harmless at first.

724
00:38:32.623 --> 00:38:34.959
I really did admire him.

725
00:38:36.503 --> 00:38:38.045
But later...

726
00:38:39.548 --> 00:38:43.175
Well. I had already gone along
with so much of it...

727
00:38:43.175 --> 00:38:45.261
Yeah. I knew you loved him.

728
00:38:45.845 --> 00:38:48.139
But Matt was not a good husband.

729
00:38:50.307 --> 00:38:53.686
Geez! Open your eyes.

730
00:38:53.686 --> 00:38:55.896
[pensive music]

731
00:38:55.896 --> 00:38:58.525
[scoffs] Oh. that. uh...

732
00:38:58.525 --> 00:39:01.861
That is the same...

733
00:39:02.695 --> 00:39:03.946
phrase.

734
00:39:03.946 --> 00:39:06.323
And you signed the guest book
at the wake.

735
00:39:06.323 --> 00:39:10.370
And the writing matches.
What is this. a threat?

736
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.122
No. I...

737
00:39:13.498 --> 00:39:14.790
just wanted to warn you.

738
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.750
About Matt?

739
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:21.881
-Did you kill him?
-No.

740
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:23.841
[music intensifies]

741
00:39:23.841 --> 00:39:25.552
You should go to the police
and tell them everything.

742
00:39:25.552 --> 00:39:28.888
So I become the prime suspect?
That works out nicely for you.

743
00:39:28.888 --> 00:39:30.264
No. they have all the rest
of the letters.

744
00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:32.434
Withholding evidence
just makes you look guilty.

745
00:39:32.434 --> 00:39:35.604
-Get out of my way. Kate.
-Hey. uh... Come on. Lisa.

746
00:39:35.604 --> 00:39:37.730
I'm just trying to help you.

747
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.190
Like you were trying to help me.

748
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.484
Oh. thank you.

749
00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:47.865
Can I help you?

750
00:39:47.865 --> 00:39:50.034
Hi. Is Peter Thompson in?

751
00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:50.910
He just left.

752
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.621
I don't know
when he'll be back.

753
00:39:52.621 --> 00:39:55.789
nobody tells me anything
around here.

754
00:39:55.998 --> 00:39:59.043
-Do you have an appointment?
-No. I'm a friend.

755
00:39:59.043 --> 00:40:01.295
I could wait in his office.

756
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:02.589
You're her.

757
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:06.258
[chuckles] The. uh.
the husband murder lady.

758
00:40:06.258 --> 00:40:09.471
Kate K. "Slay safe."

759
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.180
Yeah. that's me.

760
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.392
[laughs] Oh! Big fan!

761
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:16.894
You know...

762
00:40:16.894 --> 00:40:19.813
my husband's a real
piece of work.

763
00:40:19.813 --> 00:40:23.150
Ugh! Oh!
Like yours. I guess.

764
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.986
Oh. no. I-it wasn't. Um...

765
00:40:25.986 --> 00:40:29.156
Matt and I loved
each other re...

766
00:40:29.156 --> 00:40:30.324
Oh. yeah. sure.

767
00:40:30.324 --> 00:40:31.283
[chuckles] I mean...

768
00:40:31.283 --> 00:40:34.328
we're all in love
until we're not. right?

769
00:40:34.995 --> 00:40:36.623
I think you're innocent.

770
00:40:36.623 --> 00:40:39.626
But. if you weren't. I get it.

771
00:40:39.626 --> 00:40:42.002
[whispers] Men are pigs.

772
00:40:43.337 --> 00:40:45.130
Thanks for watching.

773
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:49.969
-The police were here yesterday.
-Oh. let me guess.

774
00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:54.932
Uh. a serious guy.
about this tall named Diggs?

775
00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:56.267
That's him.

776
00:40:56.267 --> 00:40:59.144
He was investigating.
you know...

777
00:40:59.144 --> 00:41:01.063
[whispers] The incident.

778
00:41:02.439 --> 00:41:06.235
Right. The incident.
Of-of course.

779
00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:08.613
He took a copy
of the security footage.

780
00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:09.614
-[Kate] Oh.
-Hm.

781
00:41:09.614 --> 00:41:13.367
And... I have a copy too.

782
00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:14.201
One for myself.

783
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:17.622
You never know when you're gonna
need it. right?

784
00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:21.208
You know. Tammy...

785
00:41:21.208 --> 00:41:25.879
it would be really helpful
if I could see that footage.

786
00:41:26.797 --> 00:41:31.093
I-I would ask the manager but it
seems you're the only one here

787
00:41:31.093 --> 00:41:32.928
who knows anything.

788
00:41:34.263 --> 00:41:36.348
You know what? When my show
is up and running.

789
00:41:36.348 --> 00:41:40.520
youshould come on it
as a special guest.

790
00:41:41.437 --> 00:41:43.773
-Really?
-Yeah.

791
00:41:50.613 --> 00:41:53.240
-When was this?
-Last month.

792
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.409
Peter... I mean. Mr. Thompson

793
00:41:55.409 --> 00:41:58.747
was handling some financial
matters for Mr. Kelsey.

794
00:41:58.747 --> 00:42:00.956
-What kind?
-I don't know.

795
00:42:00.956 --> 00:42:05.169
[Tammy] Something
about a second location.

796
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:07.338
Hm.

797
00:42:07.797 --> 00:42:09.882
I've never seen them
argue before.

798
00:42:09.882 --> 00:42:12.509
They were best friends.

799
00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:14.428
Detective Diggs saw this?

800
00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:16.180
Yep.

801
00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:18.974
[sighs]

802
00:42:20.976 --> 00:42:23.187
-Thanks.
-Yep. Any time.

803
00:42:23.187 --> 00:42:25.898
So. when am I gonna be
on your show?

804
00:42:25.898 --> 00:42:27.776
[chuckles]

805
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.529
Hey. stranger.

806
00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:35.199
Brit. what are you doing here?

807
00:42:35.199 --> 00:42:36.367
You're my muse.

808
00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:40.079
and I'm hoping. my mentor?

809
00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:40.871
I. uh...

810
00:42:40.871 --> 00:42:42.539
Come on. we'd make such
a great team.

811
00:42:42.539 --> 00:42:46.586
I'm flattered. but someone is
trying to frame me for murder.

812
00:42:46.586 --> 00:42:50.381
Maybe even kill me. I've got the
gossip rags all over me.

813
00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:51.716
-So--
-That's the thing though.

814
00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:55.804
They think you're guilty.
I don't. I could help you.

815
00:42:55.804 --> 00:42:56.887
Just answer a few questions.

816
00:42:56.887 --> 00:43:00.474
Look. any second Detective Diggs
could slap some cuffs on me.

817
00:43:00.474 --> 00:43:01.517
I'm-I'm running out of time.

818
00:43:01.517 --> 00:43:04.687
and it seems like everyone
in this town has a secret.

819
00:43:04.687 --> 00:43:06.188
-Do you?
-What?

820
00:43:06.188 --> 00:43:08.190
-Have a secret?
-Of course not.

821
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.527
The truth always comes out.
One way or another.

822
00:43:11.527 --> 00:43:13.655
Well. sure. I hope so.

823
00:43:13.655 --> 00:43:17.074
[dramatic music]

824
00:43:45.436 --> 00:43:46.813
[gasps]

825
00:43:47.312 --> 00:43:48.690
[sighs]

826
00:43:50.524 --> 00:43:52.609
-Hey! You okay?
-Ah!

827
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:55.195
-You look freaked out.
-Uh. I. I don't know.

828
00:43:55.195 --> 00:43:58.825
I... I thought. uh...
I don't know what I thought.

829
00:43:58.825 --> 00:44:00.743
I saw you come out
of the office.

830
00:44:00.743 --> 00:44:03.078
Were you looking for me?

831
00:44:03.078 --> 00:44:04.455
Sort of.

832
00:44:05.456 --> 00:44:08.083
Okay. look. I don't know
what they told you.

833
00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:10.670
But... we've been friends
for a long time.

834
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.505
and I deserve a chance
to explain myself.

835
00:44:15.466 --> 00:44:16.550
[sighs]

836
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.218
Matt and I. we...

837
00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:23.348
Well. it's complicated.
I just. I need you to know

838
00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:26.310
that I had nothing
to do with those photos.

839
00:44:27.186 --> 00:44:29.021
The what?

840
00:44:30.732 --> 00:44:32.065
What's this?

841
00:44:32.065 --> 00:44:33.400
[Peter] Someone leaked
pictures of us

842
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.070
to what seems like every news
site on earth.

843
00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:38.948
[sighs]

844
00:44:38.948 --> 00:44:40.783
[sighs] Okay. I have to go.

845
00:44:40.783 --> 00:44:43.619
Kate. please. Look.
I need the chance to explain

846
00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:46.038
what you saw at the firm.

847
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.713
[breathing heavily]

848
00:44:54.588 --> 00:44:56.006
Lenore.

849
00:44:56.006 --> 00:44:58.425
Are you okay?
Did you run here?

850
00:44:58.425 --> 00:45:01.971
Did you see the photo?
It's innocent. I-I swear.

851
00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:04.306
Kate... Kate. breathe.

852
00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:06.851
I saw the picture
and immediately recognized

853
00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:09.520
from our couples' vacation
last year.

854
00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:14.776
Is this. is this illegal?
It-it feels illegal.

855
00:45:15.484 --> 00:45:17.946
Where did they get the photo?

856
00:45:17.946 --> 00:45:18.821
No idea.

857
00:45:18.821 --> 00:45:19.906
One of us get hacked?

858
00:45:19.906 --> 00:45:24.827
But. the thing is. is
I think Matt took that photo.

859
00:45:24.827 --> 00:45:27.997
So then. somebody
has Matt's phone.

860
00:45:27.997 --> 00:45:29.581
[phone rings]

861
00:45:31.041 --> 00:45:33.377
[pensive music]

862
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.922
[Kate] Oh. my God!

863
00:45:36.255 --> 00:45:37.589
What?

864
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:41.093
It's Matt... and Lisa.

865
00:45:41.093 --> 00:45:43.345
[music intensifies]

866
00:45:43.345 --> 00:45:45.597
These photos are
spreading everywhere.

867
00:45:45.597 --> 00:45:48.810
I'm gonna be a meme
in 20 minutes.

868
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.727
[cup shattering]

869
00:45:54.523 --> 00:45:57.651
Hey. I hate that
this is happening to you.

870
00:45:57.651 --> 00:46:00.529
We're gonna find out
who did this.

871
00:46:00.529 --> 00:46:02.865
[Garrett]
What's the problem here?

872
00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.075
You look great.

873
00:46:05.075 --> 00:46:06.035
And Peter is hot!

874
00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:07.912
I don't know what
you're so pissed about.

875
00:46:07.912 --> 00:46:12.041
They're private photos
from Matt's phone.

876
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:13.208
What can we do. legally?

877
00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:16.753
Oh. you can't sue the
whole internet.

878
00:46:17.254 --> 00:46:18.047
Oh. yikes!

879
00:46:18.047 --> 00:46:19.966
Looks like Matt and Lisa
were brewing up

880
00:46:19.966 --> 00:46:21.884
more than just pale ales.

881
00:46:21.884 --> 00:46:22.802
Okay. that is not funny.

882
00:46:22.802 --> 00:46:24.929
And she's the one that's
sending me those hate letters.

883
00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:28.975
Hm. Meanwhile.
Brit is gaining followers.

884
00:46:28.975 --> 00:46:31.727
You know. I bet
she's behind these leaks.

885
00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:32.769
Unless it's you.

886
00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:35.188
There's no such thing
as bad press.

887
00:46:35.188 --> 00:46:36.523
I would never!

888
00:46:36.523 --> 00:46:40.611
Like you said. it's probably
the little wannabe. Right?

889
00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:42.404
Did I tell you that
she ambushed me

890
00:46:42.404 --> 00:46:43.990
demanding that we work together?

891
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.199
Well. there you go.

892
00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:49.411
Maybe you should take her up
on that offer.

893
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:51.622
See what she knows.

894
00:46:51.622 --> 00:46:54.666
[mellow music]

895
00:47:04.886 --> 00:47:08.221
[intense music]

896
00:47:12.894 --> 00:47:14.353
Hello?

897
00:47:17.023 --> 00:47:18.482
Hello?

898
00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:26.698
[distant creaking]

899
00:47:29.618 --> 00:47:31.161
[switch clicks]

900
00:47:34.414 --> 00:47:38.086
[suspenseful music]

901
00:47:47.929 --> 00:47:49.304
[grunts]

902
00:47:51.306 --> 00:47:53.183
[water sloshing]

903
00:47:53.183 --> 00:47:55.394
[Lenore] I am working
the night shift.

904
00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:57.897
I just came home
for a quick shower.

905
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.231
Didn't think you'd be here.

906
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:02.068
Sorry. if you're trying
to avoid me.

907
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:05.529
It's been a long day.

908
00:48:05.529 --> 00:48:07.698
[Peter] Yeah. for me. too.

909
00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:10.826
My work is stressful.
you've no idea.

910
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.828
Peter. please.

911
00:48:13.537 --> 00:48:14.038
[sighs]

912
00:48:14.038 --> 00:48:18.000
Okay. Uh. can just go ahead
and finalize the separation?

913
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.294
This limbo thing
is driving me crazy.

914
00:48:21.795 --> 00:48:24.966
It is not really right time.

915
00:48:24.966 --> 00:48:27.009
with everything going on.

916
00:48:28.218 --> 00:48:29.594
Yeah. of course.
you care more about

917
00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:31.847
how it looks than I how feel.

918
00:48:36.185 --> 00:48:36.768
Hey.

919
00:48:36.768 --> 00:48:38.980
I'm sorry.
I should've called first.

920
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.441
But I just couldn't be
alone in the house.

921
00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:44.860
Figured we could do game night?

922
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.278
I'm going for a run.

923
00:48:46.278 --> 00:48:48.363
I'll stick to my usual schedule
from now on.

924
00:48:48.363 --> 00:48:50.907
You can avoid me
if you want to.

925
00:48:54.996 --> 00:48:56.872
Well. you're welcome to stay
for a bit.

926
00:48:56.872 --> 00:49:00.001
but I'll have to go
to the station soon.

927
00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:04.088
We really don't have to...

928
00:49:04.088 --> 00:49:04.755
No.

929
00:49:04.755 --> 00:49:07.507
[inhales deeply] I want to.

930
00:49:21.105 --> 00:49:23.024
[Lenore sighs]

931
00:49:23.024 --> 00:49:24.108
[Kate chuckles]

932
00:49:24.108 --> 00:49:24.733
So. uh...

933
00:49:24.733 --> 00:49:28.904
do you wanna talk about
what I just walked in on?

934
00:49:28.904 --> 00:49:31.406
Are you and Peter okay?

935
00:49:32.365 --> 00:49:33.993
No.

936
00:49:34.493 --> 00:49:36.286
And. no.

937
00:49:39.331 --> 00:49:41.291
[phone ringing]

938
00:49:44.544 --> 00:49:46.296
Sergeant Thompson.

939
00:49:49.466 --> 00:49:51.052
At Mendaville?

940
00:49:51.968 --> 00:49:55.347
-What?
-[Lenore] Yeah. I'm on my way.

941
00:49:55.347 --> 00:49:57.474
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

942
00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.727
-[Lenore] Sit back here?
-Okay.

943
00:50:01.229 --> 00:50:03.980
-Cause of death?
-What's she doing here?

944
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.025
She owns the crime scene.

945
00:50:06.025 --> 00:50:08.236
What's the cause of death?

946
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.489
Lisa was bludgeoned with
an unknown blunt object.

947
00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:14.200
Similar head wound.
length. depth.

948
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.659
So. yeah. we can wait
for the crime lab

949
00:50:15.659 --> 00:50:17.119
to give us the report.
but my gut tells me

950
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:20.872
it's gonna be the same murder
weapon used in Matt's death.

951
00:50:20.872 --> 00:50:22.833
Oh. shit!

952
00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:24.459
Do we have a time frame?

953
00:50:24.459 --> 00:50:26.295
Javier left her here alone
around 6:00 p.m..

954
00:50:26.295 --> 00:50:28.421
weekend bartender came in
found her body.

955
00:50:28.421 --> 00:50:29.840
He was here to get
his paycheck.

956
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.217
Her body is still warm upstairs!

957
00:50:31.217 --> 00:50:32.759
[Diggs] I missed something.
[Lenore] Hey.

958
00:50:32.759 --> 00:50:34.344
[Diggs]
And this is happening again.

959
00:50:34.344 --> 00:50:37.806
Keep it together.
You are a professional.

960
00:50:37.806 --> 00:50:40.934
And I need you
to solve this now...

961
00:50:41.185 --> 00:50:43.728
before someone else gets hurt.

962
00:50:44.855 --> 00:50:48.024
You mean killed. sarge?

963
00:50:48.024 --> 00:50:49.776
Before someone gets killed.

964
00:50:49.776 --> 00:50:53.197
[dramatic music]

965
00:50:58.952 --> 00:51:00.329
[grunts]

966
00:51:02.998 --> 00:51:04.833
Kate. Hey.

967
00:51:06.835 --> 00:51:08.378
Hey. Peter.

968
00:51:09.588 --> 00:51:11.215
How are you?

969
00:51:11.215 --> 00:51:13.508
Not sleeping so great. You?

970
00:51:13.675 --> 00:51:18.347
Same. Yeah. I guess I'm trying
to tire myself out.

971
00:51:18.555 --> 00:51:21.391
You said you wanted
to tell me the truth.

972
00:51:23.393 --> 00:51:24.436
Yeah.

973
00:51:24.436 --> 00:51:26.646
Ah. let's go get some tea.

974
00:51:33.403 --> 00:51:36.781
Diggs wants me to come in
for questioning later.

975
00:51:37.908 --> 00:51:38.408
Oh.

976
00:51:38.408 --> 00:51:41.578
[scoffs] I hate that
I'm a suspect.

977
00:51:42.078 --> 00:51:43.038
I would never hurt Matt.

978
00:51:43.038 --> 00:51:46.958
And I didn't even know
this Lisa woman.

979
00:51:48.543 --> 00:51:52.422
What were you and Matt
fighting about at the office?

980
00:51:54.133 --> 00:51:57.844
I used to have a gambling
problem in college.

981
00:51:57.844 --> 00:51:59.554
I outgrew it. straightened up.

982
00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:02.682
And then. a few years ago.
I started again.

983
00:52:02.682 --> 00:52:04.310
Little sports betting.

984
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.355
It was harmless.
until I started losing.

985
00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:08.855
How much?

986
00:52:08.855 --> 00:52:12.318
I had a secret credit card.
and I maxed it out.

987
00:52:15.279 --> 00:52:17.281
Did Matt know this?

988
00:52:18.407 --> 00:52:20.201
He offered to help me
payoff my debt

989
00:52:20.201 --> 00:52:23.954
and kick the habit if I
introduced him at the office.

990
00:52:23.954 --> 00:52:25.080
He wanted to secure financing

991
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.249
for Mendaville's
second location.

992
00:52:27.249 --> 00:52:29.042
[breathing deeply]

993
00:52:29.042 --> 00:52:31.044
Called in favors.
got my boss on board.

994
00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:35.840
And then a few weeks ago.
he swings by and says he's out.

995
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.634
Just like that.

996
00:52:38.386 --> 00:52:40.221
I threatened him.

997
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:42.306
I just felt used.

998
00:52:43.182 --> 00:52:45.309
He didn't want me
involved. either.

999
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:49.230
Like. why would he go to you
when we have the money?

1000
00:52:50.063 --> 00:52:52.233
Yeah. I don't know.

1001
00:52:55.777 --> 00:52:57.028
What were you doing that night?

1002
00:52:57.028 --> 00:53:01.450
You went for your run. and
you saw me leave. and then?

1003
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.455
I went to a poker game.

1004
00:53:07.872 --> 00:53:08.623
[chuckles]

1005
00:53:08.623 --> 00:53:10.459
I texted Matt before.
I was hoping

1006
00:53:10.459 --> 00:53:13.044
that I could borrow
some money.

1007
00:53:13.628 --> 00:53:15.297
He never replied.

1008
00:53:15.588 --> 00:53:18.883
Thought I could win it all back.
and pay off the debt...

1009
00:53:18.883 --> 00:53:21.011
make everything right.

1010
00:53:21.928 --> 00:53:23.347
I lost. of course.

1011
00:53:23.347 --> 00:53:26.850
Is this what you and Lenore
were fighting about?

1012
00:53:27.934 --> 00:53:29.311
Yeah.

1013
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:31.896
She found my credit card
statement.

1014
00:53:33.189 --> 00:53:36.277
Things between us have
not been good.

1015
00:53:36.818 --> 00:53:39.447
[breathing deeply]

1016
00:53:43.492 --> 00:53:45.577
Everything is gonna be okay.

1017
00:53:45.577 --> 00:53:49.248
I'll-I'll help you in
anyway that I can.

1018
00:53:49.248 --> 00:53:52.584
But. you need to go
and talk to a therapist.

1019
00:53:52.584 --> 00:53:55.296
And no more gambling.

1020
00:53:58.048 --> 00:54:00.091
Thanks. Kate.

1021
00:54:02.344 --> 00:54:03.720
Hey.

1022
00:54:04.721 --> 00:54:06.097
What are you doing here. Kate?

1023
00:54:06.097 --> 00:54:10.018
Uh. we were just talking
about yesterday.

1024
00:54:10.018 --> 00:54:13.021
-Hm.
-About everything.

1025
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:14.440
Hm.

1026
00:54:16.066 --> 00:54:17.485
Yeah.

1027
00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:23.407
Okay. Um. I am-I am...

1028
00:54:23.407 --> 00:54:26.993
I'm gonna give you guys
a minute.

1029
00:54:32.999 --> 00:54:36.044
Diggs is expecting you
at the station.

1030
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.005
Maybe I should get a lawyer.

1031
00:54:40.424 --> 00:54:43.344
Well. just don't lie
to the police.

1032
00:54:43.344 --> 00:54:44.345
and I'm sure you'll be fine.

1033
00:54:44.345 --> 00:54:46.888
[Peter] It's nice to have you
give a damn about me

1034
00:54:46.888 --> 00:54:47.847
for a change. Lenore.

1035
00:54:47.847 --> 00:54:49.891
Peter. please.
don't start this again.

1036
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:53.479
I'm under enough pressure
at the station.

1037
00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:02.363
[door opens]

1038
00:55:02.695 --> 00:55:06.074
-Kate. hey. Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

1039
00:55:06.074 --> 00:55:08.910
Um. isn't this still
a crime scene?

1040
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:09.953
Should. should we be here?

1041
00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:11.746
Oh. uh.
the back room is taped off.

1042
00:55:11.746 --> 00:55:13.665
Plus. no one was murdered
out here. they said

1043
00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:15.334
we can reopen
in a couple of days.

1044
00:55:15.334 --> 00:55:16.292
-Oh.
-Sit. sit.

1045
00:55:16.292 --> 00:55:19.754
[Javier] I have some small batch
whiskeys I want you to try.

1046
00:55:20.171 --> 00:55:23.425
Of course. I want to honor
Matt's vision for Mendaville.

1047
00:55:23.425 --> 00:55:27.303
but it doesn't mean we can't
update a little bit. right?

1048
00:55:27.471 --> 00:55:29.013
Um. I guess.

1049
00:55:29.013 --> 00:55:31.724
But doesn't it feel a bit soon?

1050
00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:36.355
Um... I don't want
to sound insensitive.

1051
00:55:36.355 --> 00:55:37.689
But I can't help but feel

1052
00:55:37.689 --> 00:55:40.108
that this is the moment
I've been waiting for.

1053
00:55:40.108 --> 00:55:42.193
You know. I...
I have everything we need

1054
00:55:42.193 --> 00:55:43.903
to take Mendaville
to the next level.

1055
00:55:43.903 --> 00:55:46.281
-Hm.
-I'm ready. Kate.

1056
00:55:46.281 --> 00:55:48.783
-You can trust me.
-Hm.

1057
00:55:49.117 --> 00:55:53.830
Matt had no vision.
no drive to expand.

1058
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.333
Uh. why do you say that?

1059
00:55:58.251 --> 00:56:00.128
Well. 'cause he was content
to stay here.

1060
00:56:00.128 --> 00:56:04.007
I mean. he's been jerking those
VC guys around for months.

1061
00:56:05.049 --> 00:56:08.303
So. you were mad at Matt?

1062
00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:12.724
Sure. I mean.
I saw the way he treated Lisa.

1063
00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:15.810
He wasn't a good guy.

1064
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.567
Um... Look. Javier.

1065
00:56:21.567 --> 00:56:25.904
I. I know you are
a savvy businessman.

1066
00:56:25.904 --> 00:56:27.406
But. um. I just don't know

1067
00:56:27.406 --> 00:56:29.533
if it's the right time
to make big moves

1068
00:56:29.533 --> 00:56:30.325
for the business.

1069
00:56:30.325 --> 00:56:33.953
So. why don't we let
the investigation wrap up

1070
00:56:33.953 --> 00:56:37.165
and then... then we can talk?

1071
00:56:37.666 --> 00:56:39.834
No. I'm not gonna be cut out...

1072
00:56:40.919 --> 00:56:42.463
left behind.

1073
00:56:45.006 --> 00:56:46.592
Sign this!

1074
00:56:47.635 --> 00:56:49.511
[intense music]

1075
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:51.846
-Now!
-Oh.

1076
00:56:51.846 --> 00:56:53.973
"A transfer of
business ownership?"

1077
00:56:53.973 --> 00:56:56.184
I... No. No. I-I...

1078
00:56:56.184 --> 00:56:58.353
-I have to speak to Garrett.
-Don't be stupid.

1079
00:56:58.353 --> 00:57:01.105
Don't be stupid. Kate.
We know how much you resented.

1080
00:57:01.105 --> 00:57:02.148
how much time Matt spent here.

1081
00:57:02.148 --> 00:57:05.569
Just sign the papers.
and be done with it once...

1082
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.155
I'm not gonna hurt you. Kate.

1083
00:57:09.155 --> 00:57:11.074
Or maybe I'm the one
who should be afraid.

1084
00:57:11.074 --> 00:57:15.621
Your husband's dead.
His girlfriend. dead.

1085
00:57:16.412 --> 00:57:17.498
Huh!

1086
00:57:17.498 --> 00:57:20.416
I'm one of the only friends
you have left.

1087
00:57:22.085 --> 00:57:24.295
Police! Don't move!

1088
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:28.049
She pulls a knife on me and I'm
the one going to the station?

1089
00:57:28.049 --> 00:57:32.762
Just a quick chat. Don't make me
regret not using cuffs.

1090
00:57:33.012 --> 00:57:35.516
Smart move. calling Lenore.

1091
00:57:35.974 --> 00:57:37.559
[sighs] Yeah.

1092
00:57:38.101 --> 00:57:39.978
Um... Tsk.

1093
00:57:39.978 --> 00:57:42.021
I've. uh. I've got
another scoop

1094
00:57:42.021 --> 00:57:44.065
that I think
you'll find useful.

1095
00:57:44.065 --> 00:57:49.362
But. you've got to tell me
about you and Lenore.

1096
00:57:53.283 --> 00:57:54.409
Fine.

1097
00:57:54.409 --> 00:57:56.745
Okay. Um...

1098
00:57:56.745 --> 00:57:58.664
I talked to Peter.
and he told me

1099
00:57:58.664 --> 00:58:02.501
that his gambling landed him
in hot water with Lenore.

1100
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:06.462
And I walked in on them...

1101
00:58:06.796 --> 00:58:09.465
talking about getting a divorce.

1102
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:14.178
So...

1103
00:58:14.887 --> 00:58:17.558
I-I told you what I know.

1104
00:58:19.267 --> 00:58:20.268
You and Lenore...

1105
00:58:20.268 --> 00:58:22.604
You guys were partners. right?

1106
00:58:22.604 --> 00:58:25.649
She never talked to you
about this?

1107
00:58:25.649 --> 00:58:27.025
No.

1108
00:58:27.693 --> 00:58:29.152
Okay.

1109
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:32.864
Last year.
we catch a homicide.

1110
00:58:32.864 --> 00:58:36.409
Now. there was some problem
submitting the evidence.

1111
00:58:36.409 --> 00:58:38.286
There was a little mistake.

1112
00:58:38.286 --> 00:58:41.749
Thing is. the guy gets off
on a technicality...

1113
00:58:41.749 --> 00:58:43.916
they call a police error.

1114
00:58:45.669 --> 00:58:47.962
He goes out and he kills again.

1115
00:58:47.962 --> 00:58:48.797
Hm.

1116
00:58:48.797 --> 00:58:51.550
She and I were partners.
but it was my signature

1117
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:53.719
on the botched report.

1118
00:58:54.135 --> 00:58:56.471
I get leave with no pay...

1119
00:58:58.724 --> 00:59:01.810
she gets my promotion
to sergeant.

1120
00:59:03.604 --> 00:59:04.979
Oh.

1121
00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:09.859
So. uh...

1122
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:12.571
you got something to prove.

1123
00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:15.239
You can't mess this up.

1124
00:59:15.239 --> 00:59:18.577
-[sighing] Hmm.
-Hm.

1125
00:59:18.577 --> 00:59:21.204
This is bullshit. I was just
trying to talk to her.

1126
00:59:21.204 --> 00:59:23.456
Oh. a pro tip.
women don't feel threatened

1127
00:59:23.456 --> 00:59:25.958
by guys who just want to talk.

1128
00:59:26.125 --> 00:59:29.045
I don't think you guys are
gonna solve this thing.

1129
00:59:29.755 --> 00:59:31.799
Is that right?

1130
00:59:31.799 --> 00:59:33.341
This town...

1131
00:59:33.925 --> 00:59:35.426
everybody's got a secret...

1132
00:59:35.426 --> 00:59:36.886
everybody's trying to cover
their own ass.

1133
00:59:36.886 --> 00:59:38.471
I mean. how are the police's
supposed to find out

1134
00:59:38.471 --> 00:59:40.849
who killed Matt when. when they
don't know the whole story?

1135
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:43.727
They can't see
the complete picture?

1136
00:59:43.727 --> 00:59:45.978
What's your secret?

1137
00:59:49.817 --> 00:59:50.734
[sighs]

1138
00:59:50.734 --> 00:59:52.527
Lisa and I. um...

1139
00:59:53.277 --> 00:59:54.278
We used to date.

1140
00:59:54.278 --> 00:59:56.572
And then she became
so obsessed with Mendaville

1141
00:59:56.572 --> 00:59:58.116
and getting a promotion...

1142
00:59:58.116 --> 01:00:01.994
Once Matt started flirting
with her. she-she dumped me.

1143
01:00:01.994 --> 01:00:05.998
We used to dream about running
the brewery together.

1144
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.961
Honestly. she changed
so much when Matt died.

1145
01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:12.714
I thought maybe
Lisa had done it.

1146
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:15.967
And now?

1147
01:00:16.175 --> 01:00:18.804
Any idea who might have
killed Matt?

1148
01:00:20.263 --> 01:00:22.766
I told you my secret.

1149
01:00:22.766 --> 01:00:23.474
What's yours?

1150
01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:27.771
I know you never trusted me.
and you were right not to.

1151
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:30.398
I guess. I had motive.

1152
01:00:31.775 --> 01:00:34.653
Anger. revenge.

1153
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.572
But. uh...

1154
01:00:39.323 --> 01:00:42.368
I loved Matt.

1155
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:44.954
And I didn't kill him.

1156
01:00:45.873 --> 01:00:48.166
Please believe me.

1157
01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.712
[knocking on window]

1158
01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:54.088
What do you think about her?
She's always

1159
01:00:54.088 --> 01:00:55.799
popping at crime scenes.

1160
01:00:55.799 --> 01:00:59.594
-So are you. Kate.
-Yeah. but I have an alibi.

1161
01:01:05.558 --> 01:01:07.059
Hey. You are not posting
that video.

1162
01:01:07.059 --> 01:01:11.397
My fans expect content.
You know what it's like.

1163
01:01:11.397 --> 01:01:12.064
This is my life.

1164
01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:14.902
My-my entire reputation.
my freedom is on the line.

1165
01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:17.069
I've been watching your videos
since high school.

1166
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:20.031
Your videos are what inspired me
to go into journalism.

1167
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:22.033
And now that I have my
own big scoop.

1168
01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:24.494
you want me to just... drop it?

1169
01:01:24.494 --> 01:01:27.079
You got hustle.
I'll give you that.

1170
01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:29.040
You. um...

1171
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.001
You remind me of me
when I just started.

1172
01:01:32.878 --> 01:01:34.670
Look. if you delete that video.

1173
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:38.257
we can work together
on something bigger.

1174
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:40.676
-Really?
-Yeah. You're tenacious.

1175
01:01:40.676 --> 01:01:43.722
You're smart. Why wouldn't
I wanna work with you?

1176
01:01:43.722 --> 01:01:45.849
Oh. my God. Kate!

1177
01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:46.725
I won't let you down.

1178
01:01:46.725 --> 01:01:50.686
But you have to tell me
everything that you know.

1179
01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:53.523
It's time to come clean.

1180
01:01:58.946 --> 01:02:00.488
[exhales deeply]

1181
01:02:02.866 --> 01:02:04.367
That's-that's Matt's phone.

1182
01:02:04.367 --> 01:02:07.662
It's not what it looks like.
I-I found it.

1183
01:02:07.913 --> 01:02:10.540
I was looking through the house
after the police left

1184
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.500
and I found it in the garden.

1185
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.252
I was gonna turn it in
to the cops.

1186
01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:16.629
but then I found your photos.

1187
01:02:16.629 --> 01:02:18.714
of you and Peter.

1188
01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:23.511
So. you leaked them
to the press.

1189
01:02:27.139 --> 01:02:29.768
Where were you the night
that Matt died?

1190
01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:31.477
I was working overnight
at the station.

1191
01:02:31.477 --> 01:02:35.816
7:00 to 7:00. I was still there
when you had your interview.

1192
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:41.029
Okay. Okay. fine.

1193
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:43.197
But you turn up
everywhere that I go.

1194
01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:44.950
How is that possible?
It's like...

1195
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:47.786
It's like someone
is helping you.

1196
01:02:48.912 --> 01:02:52.290
Now that you're my mentor.
I have to admit.

1197
01:02:52.665 --> 01:02:55.209
I've had an inside man.

1198
01:02:55.209 --> 01:02:56.711
[chuckles]

1199
01:02:58.046 --> 01:02:59.171
[sighs]

1200
01:02:59.171 --> 01:03:02.091
Yes. fine. It was me.

1201
01:03:02.091 --> 01:03:04.594
-Why?
-It's a 24-hour news cycle.

1202
01:03:04.594 --> 01:03:06.304
People were starting
to lose interest.

1203
01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:09.473
I needed to do something
to stir you into action.

1204
01:03:09.473 --> 01:03:11.935
Brit was an easy mark.

1205
01:03:11.935 --> 01:03:13.311
Thank you.

1206
01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:15.104
Okay. can we stay
focused here. please?

1207
01:03:15.104 --> 01:03:18.900
Look. I'm sorry I fed Brit
info about your whereabouts.

1208
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.735
Okay? I'm sorry.

1209
01:03:20.735 --> 01:03:21.485
I'm sorry.

1210
01:03:21.485 --> 01:03:24.196
You're lucky that I have Diggs
finally on my side.

1211
01:03:24.196 --> 01:03:27.450
and Javier is on the top
of the suspects list.

1212
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.451
He had the most to gain now that

1213
01:03:28.451 --> 01:03:30.954
Lisa and Matt
are out of the picture.

1214
01:03:30.954 --> 01:03:33.164
It could be someone else.

1215
01:03:33.164 --> 01:03:35.791
A random killer. a-a stalker.

1216
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:38.711
No. it's always the least
likely suspect.

1217
01:03:38.711 --> 01:03:39.880
Do you ever watch my shows?

1218
01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.091
It's always the
mostlikely suspect.

1219
01:03:44.759 --> 01:03:46.677
[sighs]

1220
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.853
Do we have a meeting?

1221
01:03:54.853 --> 01:03:58.814
[sighs] Did you get any leads
from Javier?

1222
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:01.860
Uh. he's being questioned now.

1223
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.277
He says that
we're not gonna solve this

1224
01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:05.030
'cause no one's telling
the truth...

1225
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:07.740
that we can't see
the full picture.

1226
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.533
So. he is our prime suspect
right now.

1227
01:04:09.533 --> 01:04:13.121
but we do have a
new suspect at play.

1228
01:04:13.704 --> 01:04:15.082
Who?

1229
01:04:17.918 --> 01:04:20.336
You told me
that you were on shift

1230
01:04:20.336 --> 01:04:22.964
the night that
Matt was murdered.

1231
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:27.510
But I pulled the logs.
and you're not on them.

1232
01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:31.555
You told me you were here.
but you weren't.

1233
01:04:33.182 --> 01:04:34.558
I lied.

1234
01:04:39.772 --> 01:04:41.942
[phone ringing]

1235
01:04:43.651 --> 01:04:45.528
It's Peter.

1236
01:04:45.528 --> 01:04:46.947
No.

1237
01:04:46.947 --> 01:04:47.446
Hey.

1238
01:04:47.446 --> 01:04:49.782
-[Peter]Where are you?
-Uh. I'm at Garrett's. Why?

1239
01:04:49.782 --> 01:04:51.492
[Peter]Lenore forgot her lunch.
so I'm at the station.

1240
01:04:51.492 --> 01:04:55.038
I just overheard. I think
they're going to arrest you.

1241
01:04:55.038 --> 01:04:56.288
-What?
-[Peter]Yeah.

1242
01:04:56.288 --> 01:04:57.748
Apparently.
there's new evidence.

1243
01:04:57.748 --> 01:04:59.918
-What did they find?
-[Peter]I don't know.

1244
01:04:59.918 --> 01:05:03.130
But... but you're innocent.
right?

1245
01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:05.548
Maybe you should just go.

1246
01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:07.550
Get on a plane or...

1247
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:08.634
I don't know.

1248
01:05:08.634 --> 01:05:10.886
I could help you.
if you wanted me to.

1249
01:05:10.886 --> 01:05:12.304
No. I-I-I can't run away now.

1250
01:05:12.304 --> 01:05:15.474
Not when I'm so close
to solving this. I...

1251
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:18.811
I care about you. Kate.

1252
01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:24.316
Stay there. I've got a plan.

1253
01:05:25.986 --> 01:05:28.071
Brit. let's go.

1254
01:05:29.197 --> 01:05:30.698
Just Brit.

1255
01:05:32.033 --> 01:05:33.617
That's fine.

1256
01:05:33.617 --> 01:05:37.164
[tense music]

1257
01:05:49.842 --> 01:05:53.138
Okay. Lenore is gone.
Where are you?

1258
01:05:53.138 --> 01:05:54.638
[whispers] Bull pen.

1259
01:05:54.638 --> 01:05:57.017
-Hi.
-[Kate]Walk with confidence.

1260
01:05:57.017 --> 01:05:58.684
And don't make eye contact.

1261
01:05:58.684 --> 01:06:01.104
[Peter]Her office is straight.
and to the left.

1262
01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:03.023
Her name is on the door.

1263
01:06:03.023 --> 01:06:05.025
I see it.

1264
01:06:13.365 --> 01:06:14.034
Lock screen!

1265
01:06:14.034 --> 01:06:15.618
[Peter]Open the lower
right desk drawer.

1266
01:06:15.618 --> 01:06:17.870
There should be a list of
passwords in there.

1267
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:19.955
She can never remember hers.

1268
01:06:19.955 --> 01:06:21.332
Got it.

1269
01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:27.630
[Kate]Look for the digital
evidence file.

1270
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.549
I-I need to know
what they have on me.

1271
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:33.220
Some photos.

1272
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.306
CCTV footage from
Garrett's building.

1273
01:06:37.306 --> 01:06:40.392
Witness statements from Peter...

1274
01:06:40.392 --> 01:06:41.936
Javier...

1275
01:06:43.604 --> 01:06:45.148
and Lenore.

1276
01:06:48.943 --> 01:06:51.821
Lenore gave a witness statement?

1277
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:52.613
Send it.

1278
01:06:52.613 --> 01:06:56.201
[suspenseful music]

1279
01:07:13.093 --> 01:07:14.052
Oh.

1280
01:07:14.052 --> 01:07:15.803
Wow. I. uh...

1281
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:20.015
This must've been
going on for...

1282
01:07:20.015 --> 01:07:21.684
Lenore and Matt?

1283
01:07:21.684 --> 01:07:23.352
According to this.
they've been

1284
01:07:23.352 --> 01:07:26.647
having an affair
for three years.

1285
01:07:30.818 --> 01:07:33.863
I thought it was my gambling
that was pulling us apart.

1286
01:07:33.863 --> 01:07:35.323
but it was here.

1287
01:07:35.323 --> 01:07:37.449
She's a cheater.

1288
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.082
What a twist!

1289
01:07:44.082 --> 01:07:46.500
Our show is gonna be huge.

1290
01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:49.879
Don't you realize
what this means?

1291
01:07:51.172 --> 01:07:52.798
What?

1292
01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:56.136
Lenore killed Matt.

1293
01:07:59.889 --> 01:08:01.308
[sighs]

1294
01:08:02.142 --> 01:08:05.145
[pensive music]

1295
01:08:10.275 --> 01:08:13.819
[mellow music]

1296
01:08:24.455 --> 01:08:26.415
[phone ringing]

1297
01:08:33.131 --> 01:08:35.300
[Kate]I know about you
and Matt.

1298
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.052
I'm surprised
it took this long.

1299
01:08:38.052 --> 01:08:40.221
We weren't always careful.

1300
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:43.057
I think it's time
we have a talk.

1301
01:08:44.184 --> 01:08:46.353
Where are you?

1302
01:08:46.353 --> 01:08:48.687
At home. in my studio.

1303
01:08:49.272 --> 01:08:51.523
I'll be right there.

1304
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:54.109
[tense music]

1305
01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:56.321
[both sighing]

1306
01:09:00.449 --> 01:09:02.952
[exhales deeply]

1307
01:09:21.762 --> 01:09:24.890
[music continues]

1308
01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:36.151
You must think I'm an idiot.

1309
01:09:36.151 --> 01:09:40.489
You record me and then edit
this any way you want?

1310
01:09:44.034 --> 01:09:46.246
[Kate] They're not on.

1311
01:09:47.162 --> 01:09:49.207
But this is an interview?

1312
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.380
[inhales deeply]

1313
01:09:58.173 --> 01:09:59.174
[sighs]

1314
01:09:59.174 --> 01:10:01.093
[suspenseful music]

1315
01:10:02.011 --> 01:10:05.014
Did you ever have sex
in my bed?

1316
01:10:06.098 --> 01:10:07.516
Kate. come on.

1317
01:10:07.516 --> 01:10:10.644
[Kate] No. I should clarify.
Did you ever have sex

1318
01:10:10.644 --> 01:10:14.648
with my dead husband
in my bed?

1319
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:20.863
We only ever met at the bar.

1320
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:28.662
So. it was your trunk
of toys I found.

1321
01:10:28.662 --> 01:10:33.251
And here. I thought Matt and
I had an exciting sex life.

1322
01:10:36.086 --> 01:10:41.675
Matt and I were two lonely
people in unhappy marriages.

1323
01:10:45.054 --> 01:10:48.182
I never wanted to hurt you.

1324
01:10:48.682 --> 01:10:51.311
You're my best friend.

1325
01:10:51.311 --> 01:10:52.811
I just...

1326
01:10:53.812 --> 01:10:57.107
I fell in love
with the wrong man.

1327
01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:05.325
That trip to Aspen...

1328
01:11:05.325 --> 01:11:07.285
you and Peter wanted
to shop and ski.

1329
01:11:07.285 --> 01:11:10.371
and that left me alone
with Matt.

1330
01:11:10.913 --> 01:11:15.335
We thought it would
be a one time thing.

1331
01:11:15.335 --> 01:11:17.378
just on vacation.

1332
01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:20.548
And that we'd come back home
and everything would

1333
01:11:20.548 --> 01:11:22.716
go back to normal.

1334
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:26.595
But it didn't.

1335
01:11:36.188 --> 01:11:38.483
Why did you kill him?

1336
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.237
What?

1337
01:11:44.154 --> 01:11:47.616
Was it because you realized that
he was never gonna leave me?

1338
01:11:47.616 --> 01:11:48.826
Or that he was screwing
Lisa. too.

1339
01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:52.204
so you. so you bashed in
his brain and then hers or...?

1340
01:11:52.204 --> 01:11:54.248
[Kate] Or did you want me
out of the way?

1341
01:11:54.248 --> 01:11:55.082
Were you coming for me?

1342
01:11:55.082 --> 01:11:59.002
And then. I was in the city
so I messed up your plans.

1343
01:11:59.002 --> 01:12:01.339
and so you decided to frame me.

1344
01:12:03.341 --> 01:12:04.967
Ah...

1345
01:12:05.217 --> 01:12:08.637
You say you spent that night
at Garrett's house that night.

1346
01:12:08.637 --> 01:12:13.142
and. yes. there is CCTV footage
of you arriving.

1347
01:12:13.142 --> 01:12:15.936
But there's a back door
that doesn't have a camera.

1348
01:12:15.936 --> 01:12:20.023
And you could have snuck out
without anybody knowing.

1349
01:12:20.774 --> 01:12:22.276
Okay. so because
Garrett's too cheap

1350
01:12:22.276 --> 01:12:25.446
to put in more cameras.
I'm a murderer?

1351
01:12:25.446 --> 01:12:30.493
I came here because I thought
you were ready to confess.

1352
01:12:30.493 --> 01:12:33.912
Why would I confess
when you're the killer?

1353
01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:40.669
Notice those lights
over by your house?

1354
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:43.005
I-I wonder what
they're doing there?

1355
01:12:43.005 --> 01:12:45.215
I wonder what they'll find?

1356
01:12:48.636 --> 01:12:50.012
Kate...

1357
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.391
-What did you do?
-[Kate] Oh.

1358
01:12:53.391 --> 01:12:55.684
No. you're. you're off duty.

1359
01:12:55.684 --> 01:12:59.062
You never carry your gun
when you're off duty.

1360
01:12:59.606 --> 01:13:01.315
What were you gonna do?
Were you going to shoot me.

1361
01:13:01.315 --> 01:13:04.818
and try to. try to pretend
it was an accident?

1362
01:13:05.068 --> 01:13:07.988
You're hoping
I'll incriminate myself...

1363
01:13:07.988 --> 01:13:10.199
agree with one of your
wild accusations.

1364
01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:12.326
But I'm a cop.
and I know how justice works.

1365
01:13:12.326 --> 01:13:16.830
[chuckles] A home-wrecker.
with moral righteousness.

1366
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:22.420
Well. I bet right now
Brit's livestream viewers...

1367
01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:25.797
they think you're
pretty damn guilty.

1368
01:13:27.341 --> 01:13:30.844
[intense music]

1369
01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:36.934
Oh. she did it.

1370
01:13:37.602 --> 01:13:39.646
[indistinct radio chatter]

1371
01:13:39.646 --> 01:13:44.191
[Lenore]You say you spent the
night at Garret's house...

1372
01:13:44.191 --> 01:13:47.903
-We found something.
-Oh. my God.

1373
01:13:48.237 --> 01:13:51.616
-Where did that come from?
-Where's your wife?

1374
01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:53.825
[indistinct chatter]

1375
01:13:53.825 --> 01:13:55.578
I think they're at Kate's.

1376
01:13:55.578 --> 01:13:56.912
[indistinct chatter]

1377
01:13:56.912 --> 01:13:58.665
[Diggs] What the hell
is she doing?

1378
01:13:58.665 --> 01:14:01.959
[indistinct chatter]

1379
01:14:06.838 --> 01:14:08.257
Pick up. Lenore.

1380
01:14:08.257 --> 01:14:08.924
[phone ringing]

1381
01:14:08.924 --> 01:14:12.094
-You did it.
-Somebody help!

1382
01:14:12.094 --> 01:14:13.804
I have to arrest you!

1383
01:14:13.804 --> 01:14:15.847
[grunting]

1384
01:14:15.847 --> 01:14:17.891
You're a murderer!

1385
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:19.434
[Lenore groans]

1386
01:14:20.018 --> 01:14:23.523
-You're crazy!
-No. Kate. I'm not!

1387
01:14:23.523 --> 01:14:26.900
[grunting]

1388
01:14:29.487 --> 01:14:30.862
[thuds]

1389
01:14:31.238 --> 01:14:32.948
Run. Kate. run!

1390
01:14:33.533 --> 01:14:37.953
You're interfering with the
arrest of a murder suspect.

1391
01:14:40.163 --> 01:14:41.666
[phone rings]

1392
01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:44.669
-Diggs. it's Kate.
-[Brit] Don't believe her!

1393
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:46.295
She did it!
She's on the run.

1394
01:14:46.295 --> 01:14:49.507
Lenore. stay where you are.
I'm on my way.

1395
01:14:49.507 --> 01:14:53.010
[intense music]

1396
01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:56.388
[grunts]

1397
01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:05.397
Come on. Kate.
There's nowhere to go.

1398
01:15:08.859 --> 01:15:11.654
This doesn't have to end badly.

1399
01:15:11.654 --> 01:15:13.656
Stay away from me!

1400
01:15:14.323 --> 01:15:16.867
Come on. Kate. please.

1401
01:15:16.867 --> 01:15:20.329
Just come to the
station with me.

1402
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:28.503
[sighs] Come on. don't make me
come up there.

1403
01:15:31.173 --> 01:15:32.550
[sighs]

1404
01:15:39.973 --> 01:15:41.475
[screams]

1405
01:15:42.392 --> 01:15:44.812
[Kate] Lenore! Oh. my God.

1406
01:15:44.812 --> 01:15:47.732
Help! Help! Lenore!

1407
01:15:47.732 --> 01:15:49.900
Help! We're in here!

1408
01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:50.942
Lenore?

1409
01:15:50.942 --> 01:15:53.070
Help! We're in here!

1410
01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:59.534
Lenore! Lenore!
Kate. what happened?

1411
01:15:59.534 --> 01:16:03.831
-She-she fell.
-Back up. don't touch her.

1412
01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:09.587
This is Officer Diggs.
I'm in the barn.

1413
01:16:09.587 --> 01:16:13.048
Officer down!
Officer down!

1414
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.844
[dramatic music]

1415
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:20.765
All vitals absent.

1416
01:16:21.431 --> 01:16:24.935
[dramatic music]

1417
01:16:29.106 --> 01:16:31.609
[birds chirping]

1418
01:16:32.567 --> 01:16:34.152
[lock clicks]

1419
01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:40.075
-[Brit] Hey.
-Hey.

1420
01:16:40.075 --> 01:16:42.745
-Do you need help?
-I'm good.

1421
01:16:42.994 --> 01:16:45.205
-So. a few things.
-Mm-hm.

1422
01:16:45.205 --> 01:16:46.164
Garrett wants a meeting to

1423
01:16:46.164 --> 01:16:47.582
discuss your
new development deal.

1424
01:16:47.582 --> 01:16:50.795
He's asking for more money
and creative freedom.

1425
01:16:50.795 --> 01:16:53.338
-So I'll set that for tomorrow?
-Hm.

1426
01:16:53.631 --> 01:16:56.216
Okay. And Javier called again.

1427
01:16:56.216 --> 01:16:59.094
About his Mendaville
buyout offer.

1428
01:16:59.094 --> 01:17:02.931
-Let's let him sweat a bit.
-Hm. Ahem.

1429
01:17:02.931 --> 01:17:05.100
And finally.
did you get a chance

1430
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.936
to review my notes
on our new podcast?

1431
01:17:07.936 --> 01:17:10.605
[Kate] Yes. They are great.

1432
01:17:10.605 --> 01:17:12.357
Let's talk about it
this afternoon

1433
01:17:12.357 --> 01:17:13.316
when I'm done recording.

1434
01:17:13.316 --> 01:17:15.695
-Perfect. Yeah.
-Okay.

1435
01:17:17.195 --> 01:17:18.572
Perfect.

1436
01:17:20.532 --> 01:17:24.161
Now. I know this is
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder."

1437
01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:26.955
But I'm thinking
about of a title change.

1438
01:17:26.955 --> 01:17:30.918
I. I want to honor
what happened to Matt.

1439
01:17:31.168 --> 01:17:33.253
And to me.

1440
01:17:34.379 --> 01:17:37.466
[scoffs] My best friend
betrayed me.

1441
01:17:37.466 --> 01:17:40.510
She slept with my husband.
she killed him.

1442
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:44.097
and then used her knowledge
of my Top Ten rules

1443
01:17:44.097 --> 01:17:45.974
to try to frame me.

1444
01:17:48.018 --> 01:17:49.561
Rule one...

1445
01:17:49.812 --> 01:17:50.938
make a plan.

1446
01:17:50.938 --> 01:17:54.107
[suspenseful music]

1447
01:17:58.445 --> 01:18:01.699
Appearances are everything.

1448
01:18:03.575 --> 01:18:05.912
Wait for the right opportunity.

1449
01:18:08.497 --> 01:18:11.291
Hide the murder weapon.

1450
01:18:19.674 --> 01:18:21.009
Solidify an alibi.

1451
01:18:21.009 --> 01:18:24.137
[music continues]

1452
01:18:46.493 --> 01:18:47.870
[thuds]

1453
01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:50.080
[thudding]

1454
01:18:51.331 --> 01:18:53.124
Patience is a virtue.

1455
01:18:53.124 --> 01:18:56.879
Let the inevitable
investigation unfold.

1456
01:18:57.587 --> 01:19:02.634
Work with the police for
as long as it benefits you.

1457
01:19:03.718 --> 01:19:05.888
Get a lawyer.

1458
01:19:07.765 --> 01:19:10.058
Keep your friends close.

1459
01:19:10.977 --> 01:19:12.602
Control the narrative.

1460
01:19:12.602 --> 01:19:16.231
[music continues]

1461
01:19:23.655 --> 01:19:28.618
Now. there may be one or two
wildcards that you don't expect.

1462
01:19:28.618 --> 01:19:29.286
But...

1463
01:19:29.286 --> 01:19:31.998
chaos can be helpful.

1464
01:19:32.455 --> 01:19:36.084
[music continues]

1465
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:46.469
-Sergeant Diggs.
-Yes?

1466
01:19:46.469 --> 01:19:51.141
Got back the autopsy on
Sergeant Thompson. uh. Lenore.

1467
01:19:52.559 --> 01:19:54.352
-Anything unusual?
-[woman 1] Not really.

1468
01:19:54.352 --> 01:19:57.815
Acute subdural hematoma that's
consistent with her injury.

1469
01:19:57.815 --> 01:20:00.525
But she also had a cranial
fracture that's weird.

1470
01:20:00.525 --> 01:20:03.695
considering she fell on the back
of her head.

1471
01:20:04.529 --> 01:20:06.489
Thank you.

1472
01:20:14.623 --> 01:20:18.126
[dramatic music]

1473
01:20:26.176 --> 01:20:27.053
[grunts]

1474
01:20:27.053 --> 01:20:28.595
[Lenore screams]

1475
01:20:30.138 --> 01:20:32.432
Help! Help! We're in here!

1476
01:20:32.432 --> 01:20:35.644
And. one extra rule
that I'm not sure

1477
01:20:35.644 --> 01:20:36.519
if I'll ever share

1478
01:20:36.519 --> 01:20:41.358
is there's always
a better suspect out there.

1479
01:20:42.275 --> 01:20:43.861
So find them.

1480
01:20:44.028 --> 01:20:46.488
Let's face it.
No one's really interested

1481
01:20:46.488 --> 01:20:49.116
in a "Good Wife's Guide
to Murder."

1482
01:20:49.116 --> 01:20:53.620
What we want is a
"Good Wife's Guide to Murder.

1483
01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.082
And How to Get Away With It."

1484
01:20:57.041 --> 01:20:57.540
Tsk.

1485
01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:00.502
I'm Kate K..
and that's all for this week

1486
01:21:00.502 --> 01:21:02.712
in "Murder And Marriage."

1487
01:21:03.713 --> 01:21:05.465
Slay safe.

1488
01:21:07.592 --> 01:21:08.969
[sighs]

1489
01:21:09.511 --> 01:21:13.015
[dramatic music]

1490
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:43.045
[music continues]

1491
01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:51.469
[suspenseful music]

1492
01:22:17.746 --> 01:22:21.499
[music continues]

1493
01:22:37.766 --> 01:22:41.519
