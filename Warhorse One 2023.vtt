3
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.833
Dave. I have Mike Stevens

4
00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.458
calling again.
Connecting you now.

5
00:00:45.583 --> 00:00:46.666
Sorry.
I got your message.

6
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:48.541
We're just a little bit busy
around here right now.

7
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.375
What can I do for you?

8
00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:55.750
Yeah. Dave. Listen.
I need your help.

9
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.708
I need you to help me to
get a group of missionaries

10
00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.250
out of Pakistan.

11
00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:06.791
Missionaries? Come on. Mike.

12
00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:09.083
I've got thousands of people
trying to escape the country.

13
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.708
Three administrations
we kept this thing together.

14
00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:13.291
and this one
just wants to walk away

15
00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.333
and let the enemy
take over the country.

16
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:17.041
So now they're hitting
us with everything they've got.

17
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.541
just as we're trying to pull out
and claim some kind of victory.

18
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.625
I... I know.

19
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:24.833
I know.

20
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.375
You can't tell me that these
people didn't know the risks

21
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.000
when they went in there.

22
00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.083
Look. you're just
going to have to tell them

23
00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:38.416
to bag it up and get out.

24
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:41.958
They're Americans.

25
00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:48.000
Americans? Americans.

26
00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.458
This ministry brought
this guy and his family over

27
00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:58.666
here to start a church

28
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:00.416
in this little village
called Sarad.

29
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:02.000
We've been using them

30
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:05.916
to coordinate the evacuation
of these ANSF interpreters.

31
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:06.958
But they just...

32
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.041
they stayed too long.

33
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.666
Mike...

34
00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.583
look. you didn't
hear this from me.

35
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:22.625
but they're pushing hundreds

36
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.791
of insurgents into that area.

37
00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.000
They've already
hit the embassy

38
00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.875
in Cabel.
government buildings.

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.583
police stations.

40
00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.125
They're even trying to dig
into the surrounding villages.

41
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.291
It's like the
TET offensive out there.

42
00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.208
The media is saying
it's the Taliban.

43
00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:36.458
but these guys
are getting trucked in

44
00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:38.500
from Pakistan. Syria...

45
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.666
They're cleansing
everything. Mike.

46
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.958
This guy is risking
his family's life for us.

47
00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:52.583
It may not mean anything to you.
but it does to me.

48
00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:54.916
I need help.

49
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:04.083
Let me see what I can do.

50
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.083
Just showed up.

51
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.291
We made it very clear.

52
00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:17.583
We told them to evac
the area immediately.

53
00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.458
He says he's leaving
tomorrow morning.

54
00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:24.125
Tell them to get
on the road right now.

55
00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:29.666
He says he's not leaving
until he evacuates everyone

56
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:32.208
from the village.
- Hold up. hold up.

57
00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:33.500
All right. there is

58
00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:38.000
a SOCOM operation
in a village in Kunar.

59
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:39.750
Let me see
if I can move them.

60
00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.916
Get you an escort
and extraction.

61
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.833
Thank you.

62
00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.625
Thank you.

63
00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:52.875
This is filing with me.

64
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.083
Soldiers...

65
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.541
All right.
I need that intel. Mike.

66
00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:57.791
What do you got for me?

67
00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:00.708
Roger that.

68
00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:02.500
All told. I've got
six of them traveling...

69
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.208
Yeah. Hit me.

70
00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:06.416
Logan. Make sure
you get all the drives.

71
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.875

And their kids.

77
00:04:28.707 --> 00:04:30.000
All right.

Rami Ahmadi
and Majida Ibrahimi.

82
00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:50.291
- 'K.

83
00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:53.832
Come on. guys. We gotta go.

84
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:03.625
We got all six
traveling right now

85
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.291
in a dark green '93 Trooper.

86
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.291
Hey.

87
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:12.791
You watch yourself over there.

88
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:18.332
Sir. we're out of clock.

89
00:05:18.457 --> 00:05:20.291
We gotta move.

90
00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:22.125
showed up.

91
00:05:25.707 --> 00:05:28.375
Commander Johns. I've got
six American missionaries

92
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.082
traveling through
the Kunar Province.

93
00:05:30.207 --> 00:05:31.457
They're in a green

94
00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:32.500
Trooper.

95
00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:35.916
They were making a run
for the Pakistani border.

96
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.000
We just heard from them.

97
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.166
They got turned around
and they're lost.

98
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.832
We need to send a unit
to link up with them ASAP.

99
00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:55.750

100
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.791

RPG! RPG!

103
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.582
I don't know
if things happen for a reason.

104
00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:23.707
If it's fate. destiny.
or the hand of God.

105
00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:00.458
Team Warhorse.
this is Warhorse One.

106
00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:01.666
Give me a sit rep. Over.

107

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:28.541
What's your status? Over.

00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:09.333
Anyone Team Warhorse. respond.

113
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:30.625
Castle. this is Warhorse One.

114
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.125
This is Chief Mirko.
We have a helo down.

115
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.458
I say again.
we have a helo down.

116
00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:40.665
Do you have eyes
on our position. how copy?

117
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:44.165
We have a helo down.

118
00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:47.333
Guys.

119
00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:48.250
[over comms] I say again.
we have a helo down.

120
00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:50.333
Do you have eyes
on our position. how copy?

121
00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.165
Roger. Warhorse.
this is Castle.

122
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.583
We are tracking your position
via UAV. Over.

123
00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:04.291
I was separated from the helo

124
00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:06.541
when we were hit.
but I am on my feet.

125
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:07.666
I am good to go.

126
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:10.875
I have contacted my team.

127
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.291
I get no comeback on comms.

128
00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:15.250
Are there any guns
up at the crash site?

129
00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:25.750
I say again. is anyone moving.
how copy?

130
00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:27.291
Solid copy. Warhorse.

131
00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:28.833
We have eyes
on the crash site

132
00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.750
due east
of your current position.

133
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:33.790
It looks like
the helo broke up on impact.

134
00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:37.375
We have no observable movement
on FLIR or comms

135
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.333
coming from the crash site. Over.

136
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.165
I say again. the crash site
is due east of your POS.

137
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.083
Over.

138
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:19.708
How copy? Over.

139
00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:24.125
Solid copy. Castle.

140
00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:30.666
I am moving to the crash site
to verify.

141
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.290
I've got tangos at 500 meters
to the north.

142
00:12:34.415 --> 00:12:38.415
They are pushing the crash site.
I am moving to intercept.

143
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.290
Over.

144
00:12:40.415 --> 00:12:41.290
Negative. Warhorse.

145
00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:43.750
I say again. the helo
broke up on impact.

146
00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:44.958
Disengage.

147
00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:48.540
Negative. Castle.

148
00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:51.458
Those are my men in that helo.
and if there are any survivors.

149
00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:53.208
I'm not leaving them
up here to die.

150
00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.333
You have a significant
aggressor force

151
00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:58.500
advancing from your northeast.
Disengage!

152
00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:01.166
We have no movement.
no signatures.

153
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:04.500
no guns up. you have
no close air support.

154
00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:08.208
Disengage.
fall back. find cover.

155
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.083
Oh. they hit them again.

156
00:13:16.208 --> 00:13:17.333
I'm moving to intercept.

157
00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:18.166
I'm going to pull them
off the crash site.

158
00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:19.416
Mirko out!

159
00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:23.833
Negative. Warhorse. Disengage.

160
00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:27.458
Somebody get me Johns!

161
00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:36.083
Go get 'em. Master Chief.

162
00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:40.875
Let's go.

163
00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:02.166
Gotcha.

164
00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:15.708
Castle to Warhorse.

165
00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:16.833
Warhorse. do you copy?

166
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.540
Warhorse. this is Castle.

167
00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:37.208
Come in. Warhorse.

168
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.333
Go for Warhorse. Over.

169
00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:41.833
[over comms] Be advised.
you have tangos advancing

170
00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.083
on your position. Over.

171
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.833
Roger that. I'm good.

172
00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.165
Negative.

173
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.208
That force has a lead element
of 30 to 40 men.

174
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:52.165
And they are moving quickly
on your position.

175
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.415
Over.

176
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.583
Roger that. I have time.

177
00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:02.666
Master Chief. this is Johns.

178
00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:03.958
Do you copy?

179
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:10.333
Mirko. do you copy?

180
00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958
Commander.

181
00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:16.250
Master Chief.

182
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.083
you have seconds here and
they're evaporating fast.

183
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.291
We're looking at
the crash site right now.

184
00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:26.666
Your team is gone.

185
00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:30.833
I don't see anybody
moving down there.

186
00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:34.165
You're on your own. son.

187
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.000
Either you break contact
and get moving...

188
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.790
or you're going to die
on that mountain.

189
00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:47.040
I can live with that.

190
00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:48.333
I can live with that.

191
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.833
Yeah. but I don't want to. son.

192
00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.875
I don't need to lose
all my guys today.

193
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.125
Fall back.
come back here. re-group.

194
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.083
and we'll go back in
and bring our boys home.

195
00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:05.750
You owe them that.

196
00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:08.250
How copy?

197
00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:16.583
Understand. Master Chief?

198
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.750
Mirko. do you copy?

199
00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:27.375
Copy. Commander.

200
00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:33.416
Falling back. Mirko out.

201
00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.791
Lieutenant. Reece!

202
00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:42.625
Get Vanzant on the horn.
Find out about assets for a QRF.

203
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.041
I want my frogman
off that mountain.

204
00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:46.666
And talk to those
Air Force guys.

205
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:48.208
Tell 'em to sort their shit out.

206
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.541
We need eyes
on this doggone mess.

207
00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:51.791
Yes. sir.

208
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.791
Come on. fuckers.

209
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:22.250
Warhorse. this is Castle.

210
00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:23.791
Do you copy. Warhorse? Over.

211
00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:33.625
Castle. this is Warhorse.
Not a good time...

212
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:43.250
No. fuck that.

213
00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:15.541
I'm a frogman.
You can't drown me.

214
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.625
You can't drown me.

215
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.416
Walters.

216
00:27:23.666 --> 00:27:24.916
Help...

217
00:27:28.041 --> 00:27:29.125
help me... help me...

218
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.583
Walters.

219
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:33.583
Relax now.

220
00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:35.875
- Help me. Help me. Help me.
- Walters.

221
00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:40.208
All right. relax.

222
00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:41.250
Please.

223
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:44.833
Not me! Not me.

224
00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:46.125
Her.

225
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:48.625
Her. Help her.

226
00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:52.166
Her.

227
00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:05.416
Shit.

228
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:10.625
Shit.

229
00:28:48.833 --> 00:28:49.791
Zoe?

230
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:53.166
Ssssh. Mama's sleeping.

231
00:28:57.708 --> 00:28:59.833
Are you Zoe?

232
00:28:59.958 --> 00:29:01.916
Mama says
we're going to be okay.

233
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:03.666
We're going here.

234
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:20.875
No. we're
not going there yet.

235
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:27.750
You see that?

236
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.541
That's where it's safe.

237
00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:35.541
Up there?

238
00:29:38.416 --> 00:29:40.250
Yeah. and my friends
are coming to meet us.

239
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:45.791
We have to wait
until she wakes up.

240
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:53.791
We should let her sleep.

241
00:29:56.458 --> 00:29:59.541
It's okay.
She'll meet us up there.

242
00:30:06.208 --> 00:30:08.083
We gotta go now.

243
00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:10.333
It's okay. Come on.

244
00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:45.333
Kid. let's go.

245
00:31:46.916 --> 00:31:48.416
You're not my papa.

246
00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:58.791
Listen. kid.

247
00:32:00.666 --> 00:32:02.750
When all this is over.
we can be friends.

248
00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:05.666
Until then. I'm in charge.

249
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.500
Got it?

250
00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:13.666
Move out.

251
00:35:17.416 --> 00:35:19.416
Hey. that's mine.

252
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:24.666
Yeah.
and if somebody spots it.

253
00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:25.833
it will give away our position.

254
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.416
You can take this one.

255
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:08.291
Papa says
guns don't solve problems.

256
00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:10.333
Yeah.

257
00:36:12.958 --> 00:36:14.458
That's why
you always carry a knife.

258
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.666
He told me you can't fight
evil stuff with evil stuff.

259
00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:26.833
Kid.
I'm one of the good guys.

260
00:36:26.958 --> 00:36:30.041
Those guys back there
that hurt your papa.

261
00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:31.958
those are the bad guys.

262
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:34.125
Why.
because they're Muslims?

263
00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:42.333
I don't care
what they believe in.

264
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:48.250
If you're intentionally
killing innocent people.

265
00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:49.875
then you're the bad guys.

266
00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:58.083
Come on. We gotta go.

267
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.083
Kid. don't move...

268
00:40:17.791 --> 00:40:18.916
You see this?

269
00:40:24.166 --> 00:40:26.708
This is why you don't
run around like a wild girl.

270
00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:30.833
There's tons of bad stuff
like this out here.

271
00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:34.500
Okay. What is it?

272
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:36.416
It's a bad thing.

273
00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:39.666
When that pin comes out.

274
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:43.375
it sets this fuse off
that detonates this bomb.

275
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.541
Oh.

276
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:53.125
Listen. no matter what you see.

277
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.125
or what you hear.
if I put you somewhere.

278
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.208
you stay there
and you stay quiet.

279
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:05.166
'Cause of the bad guys?

280
00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:08.375
Yeah.
Yeah. because of the bad guys.

281
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.083
All right. we should
get out of here.

282
00:43:06.708 --> 00:43:09.541
Psst! Now go.

283
00:44:54.583 --> 00:44:55.666
You're bleeding.

284
00:45:00.375 --> 00:45:01.500
It's not mine.

285
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.041
Come on. we gotta go.

286
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.333
Come on!

287
00:45:55.458 --> 00:45:56.458
You left me.

288
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.875
You left me.

289
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:23.750
I'm sorry. kid.

290
00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:26.458
It won't happen again.

291
00:46:28.541 --> 00:46:29.458
Promise?

292
00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:32.541
Promise.

293
00:46:59.625 --> 00:47:01.250
Let's go.

294
00:47:04.791 --> 00:47:05.916
Come on. kid.

295
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.458
It's okay. they're gone.

296
00:48:42.916 --> 00:48:43.916
What?

297
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:49.916
They killed Billy.
The one with the hat.

298
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.000
The one with the scar.

299
00:48:58.541 --> 00:48:59.958
I'll remember 'em.

300
00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:08.708
All right. come on.
We should go.

301
00:49:49.208 --> 00:49:51.000
Hey. I'll be right back.

302
00:49:51.125 --> 00:49:52.083
No. wait!

303
00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.333
It's okay.

304
00:49:57.125 --> 00:49:58.833
I'm just going to go take
a peek at the next ridge.

305
00:50:01.791 --> 00:50:02.708
We made a promise.

306
00:50:05.125 --> 00:50:09.000
Sit here. don't move.
and don't make a sound.

307
00:50:38.666 --> 00:50:40.166
Castle. this is Warhorse One.
do you copy?

308
00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:41.875
Over.

309
00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:49.875
Castle. this is Warhorse One.
Do you read me? Over.

310
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.958

We have you Lima Charlie.

[over comm]

314
00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:05.916
Bad comms. Over.

315
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:07.750
Roger. Command needs a sit rep.

316
00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:09.041
What's your status?

317
00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:14.708
I have a heavy aggressor
force hunting me and my AO.

318
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:17.791
I need immediate evac. Over.

319
00:51:17.916 --> 00:51:19.750
Roger that. What is your
current pos?

320
00:51:23.875 --> 00:51:27.625
I am one kilometer past Giants
pushing to Raiders.

321
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.625
I have one mission objective.

322
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.000
I say again. I have one

323
00:51:32.125 --> 00:51:36.916
small objective.
need immediate extraction.

324
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:38.750
How copy?

325
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:41.166
[over comm] Good copy on
the objective. updating now.

326
00:51:41.291 --> 00:51:44.916
We have no air assets
available in theater.

327
00:51:45.041 --> 00:51:47.125
Looking for birds
to allocate your direction

328
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.666
but you will have to stand by.

329
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:51.333
We are dealing with
heavy TIC at this time.

330
00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:53.791
Roger that.

331
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:58.541
I'll wait for further. Over.

332
00:51:58.666 --> 00:51:59.458
We understand the urgency

333
00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:00.791
of your situation.

334
00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:03.416
You will have to stand by.

335
00:52:03.541 --> 00:52:05.208
Hold what you got.

Oh six hundred. Castle?

Affirmative. Warhorse.

339
00:52:13.458 --> 00:52:15.416
That's the best
we can do at this time.

340
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.125
Roger that. Castle.

341
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.583
Advise if you can
implement sooner.

342
00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:27.583
Warhorse One out.

343
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.125
Roger. Castle out.

344
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.666
Reece.
what's the word on Vanzant?

345
00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:37.208
No word yet. sir.

346
00:52:37.333 --> 00:52:39.041
Give me a phone.
I'll call him myself.

347
00:53:34.708 --> 00:53:35.583
Whatcha doing?

348
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:40.750
A little surprise
for the bad guys.

349
00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:42.083
Come on. it's time to rack out.

350
00:54:09.375 --> 00:54:10.625
Are we going to die?

351
00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:15.041
No. we're going to
be just fine.

352
00:54:19.666 --> 00:54:21.416
We just have to make it
to the top of that mountain.

353
00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:26.166
How did you know
I was here?

354
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.416
We were in the area
looking for someone.

355
00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:34.125
Looking for a bad guy?

356
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.000
Yeah. looking for
a bad guy.

357
00:54:38.666 --> 00:54:41.250
Then we got the redirect
that your family

358
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:45.458
was trying to escape the area.
so we came looking for you.

359
00:54:47.125 --> 00:54:48.041
We?

360
00:54:50.666 --> 00:54:52.083
Yeah. my friends and I.

361
00:54:55.666 --> 00:54:57.583
Where are your friends now?

362
00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:03.541
Our helicopter
was shot down.

363
00:55:05.333 --> 00:55:06.625
What about you?

364
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:12.750
I fell out
before it crashed.

365
00:55:15.125 --> 00:55:18.041
You fell from the sky?
Like an angel?

366
00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:26.125
I'm no angel.

367
00:55:29.916 --> 00:55:31.458
You're my angel.

368
00:55:45.916 --> 00:55:48.083
I hope the bad guys
don't get us.

369
00:55:50.875 --> 00:55:51.791
They won't.

370
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.833
Time for bed. kid.

371
00:56:10.416 --> 00:56:12.208
Can you tell me a story?

372
00:56:14.916 --> 00:56:18.291
A story. huh?
What kinda story?

373
00:56:19.916 --> 00:56:22.166
I like superheroes.

374
00:56:23.583 --> 00:56:24.833
Superheroes. huh?

375
00:56:29.875 --> 00:56:31.583
I got a hero story for ya.

376
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.500
It's about the bravest man
I've ever met.

377
00:56:37.958 --> 00:56:39.625
Aziz Latiri.

378
00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:43.333
He was a Muslim.

379
00:56:46.625 --> 00:56:47.541
One day...

380
00:56:47.666 --> 00:56:49.416
No. once upon a time.

381
00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:55.625
Okay.
Once upon a time.

382
00:56:55.750 --> 00:57:00.000
in a faraway place
called Kirkuk.

383
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:04.250
me and my friends
were pinned down

384
00:57:04.375 --> 00:57:06.541
and surrounded by enemies.

385
00:57:08.416 --> 00:57:10.375
And it didn't look good for us.

386
00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.375
I didn't think we were
gonna make it out.

387
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:30.875
And all of a sudden.
a truck pulled up.

388
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.208
and a guy jumped out.
a peshmerga fighter.

389
00:57:39.375 --> 00:57:42.375
and he gave us cover
and allowed me and my friends

390
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.708
to get outta there.

391
00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:50.125
At first I thought
he was just crazy.

392
00:57:55.625 --> 00:57:58.250
And then I realized
he was just really brave.

393
00:58:05.333 --> 00:58:07.041
He saved our lives that day.

394
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:23.958
Rest your soul. Aziz.

395
00:58:29.125 --> 00:58:30.083
Rest your soul.

396
00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:04.875
Team Warhorse.

397
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.250
Change of plans. boys.
Robin Hood is a push.

398
00:59:08.375 --> 00:59:09.625
We have a new objective.

399
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:12.291
We need an immediate
extraction of U.S. citizens.

400
00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:14.208
They are traveling
in a green Trooper

401
00:59:14.333 --> 00:59:17.625
heading east on Nangala Road.
Six friendlies.

Good luck. Mirko.

One minute. boys.

411
00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:55.833
RPG! RPG!

412
01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:10.750
Wake up. Wake up. kid.

413
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.291
Let's go.

414
01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:38.625
Who's that?

415
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.875
Snap out of it. kid.
We gotta go.

416
01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:21.208
Kid! Snap out of it. let's go!

417
01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:33.666
We gotta go.

418
01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:37.458
Go ahead.

419
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:38.500
Ha!

420
01:04:42.333 --> 01:04:43.458
Come here.

421
01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:48.666
Grip it tight.

422
01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:50.833
That way.
in case you gotta swing.

423
01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.833
it won't fall outta your hand.

424
01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:58.250
When you're ready to throw it.
loosen your grip.

425
01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:03.291
imagine you're
cutting through your target.

426
01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:06.875
and drive the tip of that blade

427
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.916
right into the center
of that target.

428
01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:11.875
Got it?

429
01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:16.500
- Ha!

430
01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:19.625
Better.

431
01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:28.875
Now try it with this.

432
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:33.416
It's okay.

433
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.166
Ha!

434
01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:51.000
Not bad. kid.

435
01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:57.125
Get your bag.

436
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.458
It's nothing.

437
01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:34.458
It's nothing.

438
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:07.666
No.

439
01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:29.916
What's that?

440
01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:36.416
It's gum.

441
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.541
Chew it. Don't swallow it.

442
01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:54.916
Good. huh?

443
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:55.958
Mm-hm.

444
01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.041
What's her name?

445
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:50.750
It's a boy.

446
01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:55.416
What's his name?

447
01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:57.958
Louie.

448
01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:01.541
Louie.

449
01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:04.291
That's a good name.

450
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:07.875
Billy says
it's a dumb name.

451
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.291
A noonkie name.

452
01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:11.666
Noonkie name. huh?

453
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:15.333
I like it.

454
01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:20.750
Mama told me
when we got back to America.

455
01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:23.375
she would get me a real Louie.

456
01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:32.083
I miss Mama.

457
01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:38.208
I know.

458
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.416
I know she's not sleeping.

459
01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:08.083
She's gone.
like Papa and Billy.

460
01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.666
It's just
a part of life. kid.

461
01:11:16.333 --> 01:11:17.875
Everybody dies.

462
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.583
Even us?

463
01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:31.083
Yeah.

464
01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:35.333
But not here.

465
01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:39.458
Not yet.

466
01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:53.333
I'm gonna get us outta here.

467
01:13:59.458 --> 01:14:00.375
Pst.

468
01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:35.166
It's very dangerous here.

469
01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:39.791
Where is your Papa and Mama?

470
01:14:39.916 --> 01:14:42.625
You shouldn't be here
by yourself.

471
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:44.500
I'm not. I'm with him.

472
01:15:00.166 --> 01:15:02.500
Please. don't shoot.

473
01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:06.500
I--I'm a simple goat herder.
searching my goat.

474
01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:15.041
This is a dangerous place.

475
01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:16.166
You shouldn't be here.

476
01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:18.250
Drop that Burner. fucker.

477
01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.083
Here. Take it. take it.

478
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:27.791
I use it for protection
against the Daesh bastards.

479
01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.000
I can help you get out of here.

480
01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:34.333
My village is not
too far from here.

481
01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:36.125
Right in the next valley. huh?

482
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.416
Yes. I will help.

483
01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:52.583
Come. I help.

484
01:15:58.875 --> 01:15:59.750
Turn around.

485
01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:14.000
You look
in the wrong direction.

486
01:16:14.125 --> 01:16:16.000
I will fucking kill you.
you understand?

487
01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:22.000
I help you.
I help you. I help you.

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:23.041
Go.

489
01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:19.166
The village
is not far from here.

490
01:17:19.291 --> 01:17:21.166
My village.

491
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:26.083
Daesh came in a few days ago.
like a brush fire.

492
01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.208
They left and now
they back again.

493
01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.375
You from here?

494
01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:41.250
No. from Pakistan.

495
01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:46.291

So no. I was not born here.

496
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:48.875
But I will die here. inshallah.

497
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.166
What about you. my friend?
Why are you here?

498
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:55.500
Just visiting.

499
01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:59.500
Very dangerous place
to visit by yourself.

500
01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:01.208
Yeah. the world's
a dangerous place.

501

Sketchy comms on our end

546
01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:43.291
Hold.

547
01:30:51.416 --> 01:30:53.416
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

548
01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:03.291
Showtime. big boy.

549
01:31:17.458 --> 01:31:18.291
Allah Akbar.

550
01:34:42.291 --> 01:34:44.791
There is a storm coming.

551
01:35:20.208 --> 01:35:21.166
Junior?

552
01:35:26.166 --> 01:35:27.250
Kobe?

553
01:37:18.125 --> 01:37:19.208
Where is she?

554
01:37:21.041 --> 01:37:22.541
Never you worry about her.

555
01:37:25.166 --> 01:37:27.666
You know. I admire
your strength.

556
01:37:29.625 --> 01:37:33.000
It must be very painful
to be here all alone.

557
01:37:33.125 --> 01:37:35.250
with none of your soldiers
to help you.

558
01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:40.083
Jarrah.

559
01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:04.708
Tell me when and where
your helicopter

560
01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:07.875
is coming for you.
And I'll let you live.

561
01:38:09.833 --> 01:38:11.208
What helicopter?

562
01:38:16.916 --> 01:38:19.000
Do you think
you are playing with me?

563
01:38:31.666 --> 01:38:34.791
So I tell you
where my helicopter is coming.

564
01:38:34.916 --> 01:38:36.333
so you can kill more of my men.

565
01:38:36.458 --> 01:38:38.958
You have killed
thousands of my brothers.

566
01:38:39.083 --> 01:38:41.958
Civilians.
Innocent women. children.

567
01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:43.000
For what?

568
01:38:45.416 --> 01:38:49.708
For the poppies. the pipelines?

569
01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:52.875
Or just another financed
puppet government?

570
01:38:54.708 --> 01:38:56.708
I think it's just
to kill shitheads like you.

571
01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:04.375
Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

572
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.208
Slaughtered invaders
throughout history.

573
01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:12.083
Alexander. the Khans.
the Persians. British.

574
01:39:12.208 --> 01:39:17.000
Soviets. and the West
will suffer the same fate.

575
01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:27.541
You American scum.

576
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.166
Sending assassins to kill us
in our peaceful villages.

577
01:39:33.291 --> 01:39:35.291
This ain't your village. asshole.

578
01:39:37.416 --> 01:39:40.750
It is now.

579
01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:45.458
And you ain't
from Afghanistan...

580
01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:49.958
but you're gonna die here.

581
01:39:55.583 --> 01:39:57.666
And so will you. American.

582
01:39:59.875 --> 01:40:01.291
And so will you.

583
01:40:44.708 --> 01:40:45.958
You like. little girl?

584
01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:02.875
You like?

585
01:41:06.375 --> 01:41:07.625
You like. little girl?

586
01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:16.625
Come. Come.

587
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:23.375
Come.

588
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.375
Come!

589
01:41:36.666 --> 01:41:37.541
Peeky boo!

590
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.333
Peeky boo!

591
01:42:16.416 --> 01:42:19.416
You are both going to die
for your transgressions today.

592
01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:11.541
Zoe?

593
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:37.708
This is mine. fucker.

594
01:46:39.416 --> 01:46:42.375
Warhorse One. this is Castle. Over.

595
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.291
Listen. Master Chief. I'm not
sure if you're reading this.

596
01:46:44.416 --> 01:46:45.708
but there's a large group
of reinforcements

597
01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:48.000
inbound on the village.

598
01:46:48.125 --> 01:46:49.083
Any luck. Reece?

599
01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:51.541
Negative contact. sir.

600
01:46:51.666 --> 01:46:53.375
How close
are those reinforcements?

601
01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.666
If he's in the village. sir.
they're almost on top of him.

602
01:47:04.708 --> 01:47:06.541
Aaah!

603
01:47:20.458 --> 01:47:21.708
Papa!

604
01:47:23.291 --> 01:47:24.625
Hey. kid.

605
01:48:17.583 --> 01:48:19.000
I told you
I'd never leave you.

606
01:48:28.666 --> 01:48:31.166
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

607
01:48:47.166 --> 01:48:48.083
All right. come on.

608
01:49:01.416 --> 01:49:02.875
Stay down. kid.

609
01:49:23.333 --> 01:49:24.833
Stay! Ears!

610
01:51:01.416 --> 01:51:03.583
Come on.
Come on. get up.

611
01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:09.000
Go!

612
01:51:16.625 --> 01:51:17.583
Come on.

613
01:52:24.083 --> 01:52:26.791
Get behind the plates.

614
01:52:26.916 --> 01:52:29.708
Get behind the vest.
Get behind the plates.

615
01:52:31.666 --> 01:52:33.083
Okay.

616
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:22.666
Come on.

617
01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:27.958
It's okay. we'll be okay.

618
01:54:01.125 --> 01:54:03.000
No. it's okay.

619
01:54:05.958 --> 01:54:07.000
It's okay.

620
01:54:07.125 --> 01:54:08.458
You're my angel.

621
01:54:11.375 --> 01:54:12.750
You're my angel.

622
01:54:15.333 --> 01:54:16.166
You're my angel.

623
01:54:33.416 --> 01:54:34.625
We're going to be okay.

624
01:54:39.541 --> 01:54:40.416
You're my angel.

625
01:54:47.083 --> 01:54:49.666
On line! On line!

626
01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:23.541
On line!
On line! On line!

627
01:56:13.875 --> 01:56:16.375
Mirko...
look at me. brother.

628
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.708
Eyes on me.

629
01:56:21.291 --> 01:56:22.166
Are you hit?

630
01:56:22.291 --> 01:56:23.416
Yeah. my back.

631
01:56:29.125 --> 01:56:31.375
Woodsy!
We're going critical.

632
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:32.958
We need to get
the fuck off the x.

633
01:56:37.333 --> 01:56:40.958
No. the girl.
Get the girl outta here.

634
01:56:48.083 --> 01:56:49.000
The package.

635
01:56:49.125 --> 01:56:50.083
I got the package.

636
01:56:50.208 --> 01:56:51.208
Roach!

637
01:57:02.666 --> 01:57:03.708
Little help!

638
01:57:05.458 --> 01:57:07.583
Clean. 150 meters.
two o'clock.

639
01:57:07.708 --> 01:57:08.875
I don't have a shot.

640
01:57:20.125 --> 01:57:20.791
[over comms] Looks like
these guys are buggin' out

641
01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:21.791
and going home. chief.

642
01:57:21.916 --> 01:57:23.000
You're clear to move.

643
01:57:24.375 --> 01:57:25.708
Roger that! Clean!

644
01:57:25.833 --> 01:57:26.833
Take us out.

645
01:57:39.291 --> 01:57:41.000
Move! Let's go. let's go!!!

646
01:58:17.041 --> 01:58:19.458
Reaper. this is Bladerunner.

647
01:58:19.583 --> 01:58:22.583
We have a full head count.
We're headed to your pos now.

648
01:58:22.708 --> 01:58:23.708
Over.

649
01:58:55.333 --> 01:58:58.750
I still don't know
if things happen for a reason.

650
01:58:58.875 --> 01:59:05.041
Whether it's fate.
destiny. or the hand of God.

651
01:59:08.125 --> 01:59:11.041
But what happened
that day changed me.

652
01:59:13.083 --> 01:59:15.583
I lost a piece of myself
that day.

653
01:59:19.291 --> 01:59:23.291
But I also gained something. Someone.

654
01:59:25.833 --> 01:59:30.791
Someone who reminded me
that the things in life

655
01:59:30.916 --> 01:59:32.375
worth living for...

656
01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:36.583
are worth dying for.

657
01:59:48.125 --> 01:59:50.458
I could never replace
the family she lost.

658
01:59:54.083 --> 01:59:56.083
but Louie and I
will do our best.

659
01:59:58.833 --> 02:00:00.625
She's my everything now.

660
02:00:01.958 --> 02:00:03.666
She's my family.

661
02:00:09.916 --> 02:00:12.000
And for the brothers
I lost that day...

662
02:00:13.625 --> 02:00:17.333
for them.
there will be a reckoning.
