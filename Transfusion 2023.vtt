00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:24.783
I got no idea.

189
00:17:24.884 --> 00:17:26.663
[chuckles]

190
00:17:26.763 --> 00:17:28.983
Probably the same shit
you dribbled to me.

191
00:17:29.084 --> 00:17:31.084
Yeah.

192
00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:33.644
Just be honest. son.

193
00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:37.263
No. we're all just men.

194
00:17:37.364 --> 00:17:39.263
None of us is Superman.

195
00:17:39.364 --> 00:17:41.364
We're not made of steel.
We're not invincible.

196
00:17:42.283 --> 00:17:44.483
Just trying to walk a line
between courage and fear.

197
00:17:46.644 --> 00:17:48.623
Pure courage is…

198
00:17:48.723 --> 00:17:50.923
taking on a task
that you're ill equipped to do.

199
00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:53.384
The job of the instructors here

200
00:17:53.484 --> 00:17:55.463
is to equip you
for any situation

201
00:17:55.563 --> 00:17:57.263
you find yourself
in the field of duty.

202
00:17:57.364 --> 00:17:59.183
[indicator clicks]

203
00:17:59.283 --> 00:18:01.604
We minimise the fear
by the repetition of training.

204
00:18:05.644 --> 00:18:08.164
Pure courage is minimised…

205
00:18:08.924 --> 00:18:10.263
because it needs to be.

206
00:18:10.364 --> 00:18:12.624
Because in the face of fear
your actions and decisions

207
00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.183
can be compromised.

208
00:18:14.283 --> 00:18:17.463
[soft eerie music]

209
00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.104
And you're in near the end?
Right?

210
00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.782
-Right?
-[men] Yeah.

211
00:18:20.883 --> 00:18:22.883
Yeah.

212
00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:24.262
That's good.

213
00:18:24.362 --> 00:18:26.143
But we're still gonna push you
physically and mentally

214
00:18:26.243 --> 00:18:28.243
harder than you ever thought
possible.

215
00:18:28.723 --> 00:18:30.723
You just gotta keep your line.

216
00:18:31.362 --> 00:18:32.623
You just gotta keep the line.

217
00:18:32.723 --> 00:18:34.723
[tyres screech]

218
00:18:35.562 --> 00:18:37.563
[car horn drones]

219
00:18:41.724 --> 00:18:43.724
Just gotta try
and keep your line.

220
00:18:46.684 --> 00:18:47.863
That's it.

221
00:18:47.964 --> 00:18:49.964
[scattered applause]

222
00:18:56.963 --> 00:18:58.342
Mate. are you right?

223
00:18:58.443 --> 00:19:00.443
[groans]

224
00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:04.262
Ambulance. Yeah.

225
00:19:04.362 --> 00:19:06.562
[tense music]

226
00:19:08.443 --> 00:19:10.443
[breathes heavily]

227
00:19:18.602 --> 00:19:20.602
[exhales]
[music stops]

228
00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:31.763
[solemn music]

229
00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:36.322
[weeping]

230
00:19:53.763 --> 00:19:55.763
Just please don't go.

231
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:03.441
When then?

232
00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:12.902
[sniffs]

233
00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.362
[solemn music continues]

234
00:20:20.963 --> 00:20:23.302
[woman] And just as a final
thought. Your Honour.

235
00:20:23.402 --> 00:20:24.782
I'd ask you to take into
consideration

236
00:20:24.882 --> 00:20:28.162
the upheaval this young man has
faced over the past seven years.

237
00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:31.021
He's been to six schools.

238
00:20:31.121 --> 00:20:33.362
Lived in Brisbane. Adelaide.
Perth and now here.

239
00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:37.061
And what are the reasons
for that?

240
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:39.021
His father. Your Honour.
has had trouble finding

241
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:41.161
fulfilling employment
since leaving the army.

242
00:20:43.961 --> 00:20:46.482
-Is your father here. son?
-Yes. Your Honour.

243
00:20:47.641 --> 00:20:49.641
Mr Logan?

244
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.441
Yes. Your Honour?

245
00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:58.323
So did you see active service.
Mr Logan?

246
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.182
Yes. Your Honour.

247
00:21:00.283 --> 00:21:03.681
Well. I had an uncle in the
Army. served in Vietnam…

248
00:21:05.882 --> 00:21:09.262
He…well. he struggled in
the years after.

249
00:21:09.362 --> 00:21:10.581
I'm fine. Your Honour.

250
00:21:10.681 --> 00:21:12.821
Now. hear me out. Mr Logan.

251
00:21:12.921 --> 00:21:14.861
Now. look. I have read over
your son's offences.

252
00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:18.141
Now this is the third time
that he's appeared here.

253
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:22.461
It was stealing. drug possession
and now destruction of property.

254
00:21:22.562 --> 00:21:24.941
And all occasions he's been
picked up by the police

255
00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:26.621
after some days away
from your care.

256
00:21:26.721 --> 00:21:28.621
that being. he's run away.

257
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:30.861
And I also read here
that his mother passed away

258
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.961
eight years ago.
so it's only you?

259
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.020
Yes. Your Honour.

260
00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:39.542
[exhales]

261
00:21:39.642 --> 00:21:41.861
Mr Logan. I sympathise with your
situation.

262
00:21:41.961 --> 00:21:43.861
I've seen your struggle
firsthand.

263
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:45.861
You're also a single parent.

264
00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:48.101
but the situation with your son
is dire.

265
00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:51.261
And by that. I mean. if he
appears before this court again.

266
00:21:51.362 --> 00:21:53.882
he'll either be sent away
or taken from your care.

267
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:55.941
Now that's the process.

268
00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:57.661
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

269
00:21:57.761 --> 00:21:59.761
Yes. Your Honour.

270
00:22:02.082 --> 00:22:04.082
And son. do you understand this?

271
00:22:05.961 --> 00:22:07.961
Yes. Your Honour.

272
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.280
Good. You're free to go
Mr Logan.

273
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.799
Thank you.
-Bow. bow.

274
00:22:26.481 --> 00:22:27.941
[door closes]

275
00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:31.001
[solemn music]

276
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.721
[soft pensive music]

277
00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:32.201
[eerie music]

278
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.960
[solemn music]

279
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.360
[school bell rings]

280
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:21.280
[man] Missed 10 days
over one term.

281
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.280
Does that sound right?

282
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.160
Yeah.

283
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.420
Billy…

284
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.859
could you wait outside
for a moment?

285
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960
Thank you.

286
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.560
[floorboards creak]

287
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:53.180
[sighs]

288
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.539
Mr Logan.
paying the amount of money

289
00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:56.899
that one does for school
like this

290
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
doesn't guarantee anything.

291
00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:01.460
What do you mean?

292
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.619
What I'm saying is…

293
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.240
Billy could be just as well
suited to a good public school.

294
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.899
You don't want him.

295
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.059
It's not about what I want.

296
00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:15.879
He doesn't seem
to want to be here. Does he?

297
00:25:20.639 --> 00:25:22.639
Mr Logan…

298
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.059
you haven't paid
last term's fees.

299
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:29.639
All I'm saying is
there are good alternatives.

300
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.419
He might be happier
at a public school.

301
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.619
It might be better for him
and easier for you.

302
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.879
I'll make sure that I pay
what's outstanding.

303
00:25:40.879 --> 00:25:42.879
And he won't miss
anymore school.

304
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.720
[waves break]

305
00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:57.879
[solemn music]

306
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.480
Hey. here he is!

307
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.379
You look thin.

308
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.260
-Do I?
-Yeah.

309
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.579
What have you done
to your fucking hair?

310
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.679
What you don't like this?

311
00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:30.898
Well. it's good on you.

312
00:26:30.998 --> 00:26:33.058
But I did try that. mate.
I looked like a fuckwit.

313
00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:35.158
[laughs]

314
00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:40.259
So you came home. eh. mate?

315
00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:43.058
Yeah. Better job.

316
00:26:43.158 --> 00:26:45.818
See her and. you know.
kid's in school.

317
00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:47.918
They're buried here.

318
00:26:49.158 --> 00:26:51.158
Well. it's really good to see
you. son.

319
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.979
Billy good?

320
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.080
How's Layla?

321
00:27:03.159 --> 00:27:05.159
Na. she sort of cut me off.

322
00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:09.679
She ended up fucking some bloke
she worked with.

323
00:27:10.958 --> 00:27:13.059
Big fat cunt.

324
00:27:13.159 --> 00:27:14.857
I followed him.
he's one of those guys

325
00:27:14.957 --> 00:27:17.618
that gets all dressed up
in lycra to ride his bike

326
00:27:17.718 --> 00:27:19.718
on a weekend.

327
00:27:21.278 --> 00:27:23.338
I nearly run the fucker over.

328
00:27:23.438 --> 00:27:25.478
-But you didn't?
-No I didn't. Corporal.

329
00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:31.258
Your daughters…
you had two of them?

330
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.359
How are they doing?

331
00:27:36.477 --> 00:27:38.517
Ah. they don't talk to me.

332
00:27:39.878 --> 00:27:41.258
Sorry to hear that.

333
00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:43.359
No. what can you do?

334
00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:47.819
You know. I thought about
going back bush

335
00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:50.099
there for a little while.
you know. going home.

336
00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:52.199
Good idea. Why didn't ya?

337
00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:55.658
Me mum and dad died and then…

338
00:27:55.758 --> 00:27:57.758
there's no work.

339
00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:00.618
Me brother and me sister.
you know. them they…

340
00:28:00.718 --> 00:28:02.958
they fucked off. there's just
no one there I knew.

341
00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:07.958
What about your boy?
How old's he now?

342
00:28:10.358 --> 00:28:12.358
He's a teenager.

343
00:28:13.997 --> 00:28:16.338
Fuck. What's he like?

344
00:28:16.438 --> 00:28:18.098
Like a teenager.

345
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:20.217
[laughs]

346
00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:22.297
Does he listen to you?

347
00:28:22.398 --> 00:28:23.497
[snorts]

348
00:28:23.598 --> 00:28:26.599
Nup. it's hard being a soldier.
when you're not a soldier.

349
00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:29.599
No cunt will listen to you.

350
00:28:30.758 --> 00:28:33.058
What are you doing for work?
What do you do?

351
00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:34.619
I'm a sales rep.

352
00:28:34.719 --> 00:28:36.719
[both laugh]

353
00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:40.099
Yeah…

354
00:28:40.199 --> 00:28:42.198
what about you? You…

355
00:28:43.037 --> 00:28:45.037
still doing the same thing?

356
00:28:47.077 --> 00:28:49.077
It's what we're good at.
Corporal.

357
00:28:50.958 --> 00:28:53.678
And I haven't got enough room in
my brain to learn other things.

358
00:28:55.517 --> 00:28:58.517
One of the reasons
I want to see you. son.

359
00:28:59.678 --> 00:29:00.977
Wanted to know
if you'd be interested

360
00:29:01.077 --> 00:29:03.077
in doing something with me.

361
00:29:05.517 --> 00:29:07.657
I need your help. son.

362
00:29:07.757 --> 00:29:09.757
Alright.

363
00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:12.578
So we can stop talking
this kind of shit now

364
00:29:12.679 --> 00:29:15.158
and talk about stuff
that really matters?

365
00:29:16.478 --> 00:29:19.697
Look. I need help.
One night. right?

366
00:29:19.797 --> 00:29:21.797

Well. we shouldn't have fucking
been there. should we?

856
01:06:26.339 --> 01:06:28.339
So. where's my car?

857
01:06:29.498 --> 01:06:31.498
I burned it.

858
01:06:32.859 --> 01:06:34.118
I beg your pardon?

859
01:06:34.218 --> 01:06:35.839
I burned it. it was a write-off.

860
01:06:35.939 --> 01:06:37.939
Figured you'd have insurance.

861
01:06:39.259 --> 01:06:42.259
So you want me to say
it was stolen and then torched?

862
01:06:48.419 --> 01:06:50.498
Do you know what I do
for a living. soldier?

Very fucking prestigious one.

865
01:06:59.418 --> 01:07:00.958
Do you have any idea
what would happen

866
01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.758
if I made a false
insurance claim

867
01:07:02.858 --> 01:07:04.938
like the one you've set me up
to make?

868
01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:08.158
And upon the mandatory
investigation of the claim.

869
01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:10.258
it was found to be fraudulent…

870
01:07:11.258 --> 01:07:13.258
I could go to jail.

871
01:07:14.059 --> 01:07:16.498
At the very least I wouldn't be
practicing law ever again.

872
01:07:25.938 --> 01:07:28.378
My son said your boy's
a fucking ratbag.

873
01:07:30.498 --> 01:07:31.878
OK.

874
01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:33.978
He's already been in trouble
with the cops.

875
01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:38.318
Yeah.

876
01:07:38.418 --> 01:07:40.419
Your boy…

877
01:07:40.939 --> 01:07:42.939
he was pissed.

878
01:07:43.499 --> 01:07:45.399
They were all drinking.

879
01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:46.839
Yeah. they might have been
drinking.

880
01:07:46.939 --> 01:07:48.798
but they didn't get behind
the fucking wheel of a car.

881
01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.278
did they?

882
01:07:50.379 --> 01:07:52.379
My car.

883
01:07:53.499 --> 01:07:55.499
Yeah.

884
01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:00.857
You need this to go away?

885
01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:05.697
Please.

886
01:08:16.458 --> 01:08:18.458
Sorry. I can't help you.

887
01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:21.617
To claim on my insurance.
I need to be honest.

888
01:08:23.617 --> 01:08:25.598
But here's some free counsel.

889
01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:26.919
As far as the fire goes.

890
01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:29.279
I'd let that fall on
your son's shoulders.

891
01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:31.118
Sounds like he's in
enough trouble already.

892
01:08:31.219 --> 01:08:33.337
and there's no upside
in you admitting to that.

893
01:08:37.618 --> 01:08:39.558
OK. so the police
are gonna be involved?

894
01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:41.658
Of course.

895
01:08:42.258 --> 01:08:44.258
What if I pay for the car?

is worth?

[chuckles softly]

899
01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:58.618
I'll get you the money and then
you just leave it alone.

900
01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:04.417
Yeah?

901
01:09:05.256 --> 01:09:07.657
You get me the money.
we'll see what we'll see.

902
01:09:09.058 --> 01:09:11.858
In the meantime. tell your boy
to find some new friends.

903
01:09:13.257 --> 01:09:15.938
I don't need my son
hanging around with trouble.

904
01:09:27.257 --> 01:09:29.257
Just give me a couple of days.

905
01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:31.598

-OK?
-Yep.

914
01:10:27.337 --> 01:10:29.337
I got you. You understand?

915
01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:36.196
Mr Logan.

916
01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:37.757
Yeah?

917
01:10:37.857 --> 01:10:39.878
Mr Logan. your wife and your son

918
01:10:39.978 --> 01:10:42.317
are both in
the RH null blood group.

919
01:10:42.418 --> 01:10:44.417
There's no RH antigens.

920
01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:46.317
Yeah. that's right.

921
01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:48.237
So you're aware of what
the problems with that are?

922
01:10:48.337 --> 01:10:50.157
Yeah. they give blood
all the time.

923
01:10:50.257 --> 01:10:52.036
They have to. It's here.

924
01:10:52.137 --> 01:10:53.237
So there's not enough blood.

925
01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.956
There's some on the way.
but we don't have enough time.

926
01:10:56.057 --> 01:10:57.237
They're both bleeding internally

927
01:10:57.337 --> 01:10:59.757
and your son has ruptured
his spleen.

928
01:10:59.857 --> 01:11:01.197

01:11:04.417 --> 01:11:06.557
And she has severe
head injuries.

932
01:11:06.657 --> 01:11:09.937
She's bleeding from her liver
from her entire gut.

933
01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:13.417
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

934
01:11:17.056 --> 01:11:19.976
Yeah. well. give them the blood.
How is the baby?

935
01:11:21.696 --> 01:11:22.916
The baby's died. OK?

936
01:11:23.016 --> 01:11:25.236
So there's not enough blood
for both of them.

937
01:11:25.336 --> 01:11:27.336
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

938

-How much?
-Couple hundred thousand.

957
01:12:54.654 --> 01:12:56.155
I don't even know
if I can pay you back.

958
01:12:56.256 --> 01:12:58.856
It was something Billy did
and I need to…
