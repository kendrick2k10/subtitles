00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.108
That's good whiskey
you're wasting.

4
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:19.982
Been away a few days. Tom.

5
00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:23.246
How'd you find me. Ranger?

6
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.031
Hound got your scent
back at the ranch.

7
00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:28.599
Shit. I smelled you
from miles away.

8
00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.602
Who am I supposed
to have pissed off anyhow?

9
00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:35.389
Hey. you done violated
the conditions of your parole.

10
00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:36.912
Like hell I did.

11
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.483
Assault. brandishing
a firearm in a public place.

12
00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:47.966
You stole a horse. rifle.
whiskey from your employer.

13
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.490
You want me to go on?

14
00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:50.578
That's my rifle.

15
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:52.493
What business do you have

16
00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:55.496
with a 10.000-dollar
plains rifle. Tom?

17
00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.108
Oh. saddle up son.
You're done.

18
00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:02.981
Try to run. I'll kill ya.

19
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.941
Hunting to feed
my family. Ranger.

20
00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:08.030
Too bad it ain't
hunting season.

21
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.686
And you're just
more trash

22
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.079
from Terlingua County
like me. Tom.

23
00:04:14.123 --> 00:04:16.473
Stop pretending
to be what you ain't.

24
00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:18.649
<i>Tyree. you got your ears on. buddy? Where you at. partner?</i>

25
00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:20.129
About 15 miles south

26
00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:23.219
of Manse Point
over Alkali Flats.

27
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.483
Just picked up Tom
that stole a horse and rifle

28
00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:28.485
and beat Joe Hansons.

29
00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.487
What can I do for you. Elmer?

30
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:33.882
<i>10-65. old Mutual Bank
over here in Mount Verde</i>

31
00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:36.711

about a half hour ago.</i>

32
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:38.452
<i>Four heavily armed gunmen</i>

33
00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.323
<i>driving one of them
off-road type rigs</i>

34
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.499
<i>came in raising
all manners of hell.</i>

35
00:04:42.543 --> 00:04:45.981
<i>Got a 10-99 code on it.
Killed three officers.</i>

36
00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:48.549
<i>Even put old Ben Copper's boy
in the ER.</i>

37
00:04:48.592 --> 00:04:51.160
<i>so figured they'd be heading
your direction there. Alex.</i>

38
00:04:51.203 --> 00:04:52.422
<i>Watch your six. buddy.</i>

39
00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:08.351
<i>10-22. subjects are armed with automatic weapons.</i>

40
00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:10.353
<i>At present. no other units
are available to assist you.</i>

41
00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:13.356
10-24. we got eyes
on that 10-80.

42
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.750
Avenue J. outside of El Paso.

43
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:17.012
We are currently in pursuit.

44
00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:18.405
<i>10-22. to confirm.</i>

45
00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:21.146
<i>four subjects carrying AK-47s.</i>

46
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.148
Left on Avenue 245.

47
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:27.327
Whoo. they're coming in hot.
Watch it. watch it.

48
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.416
Ooh. this sumbitch is flying.

49
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.156
Come on. man.
you gonna lose 'em.

50
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.914
<i>10-22.
we have a chopper inbound. ETA: 17 minutes.</i>

51
00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.003
Let's go. Gas. gas. gas!
Let's go!

52
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:08.803
10-24. we lost 'em.

53
00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.587
They're heading
southbound on Terlingua.

54
00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:12.546
Shit.

55
00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:26.298
<i>10-22 has broken pursuit.</i>

56
00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:30.259
<i>Suspects were last seen headed
southbound on Terlingua Street.</i>

57
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.960
One suspect has left
the vehicle.

58
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:37.309
We are going to engage.

59
00:06:37.353 --> 00:06:39.616
"And there before me
was a white horse.

60
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.749
Its rider was named Death

61
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.272
and Hell...

62
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:45.013
- ...so close behind Devil."
- Shit! Gun! Get out now!

63
00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:54.762
<i>10-22.
this is 10-24. Come in.</i>

64
00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:56.416
<i>Are you engaging the suspects?</i>

65
00:06:57.504 --> 00:07:00.420
<i>Shane. if you're there.
answer me.</i>

66
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:15.478
They'll make the border
before the state police have a chopper off the ground.

67
00:07:15.522 --> 00:07:17.132
Yeah. wish I was with them.

68
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:19.961
Creaky bastard like you

69
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.093
creeping up
on a full-blood Tonkawa.

70
00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:24.966
Spot me.

71
00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.448
<i>Mexican police
ain't got a unit close enough to intercede.</i>

72
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.710
<i>These boys should be considered</i>

73
00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:31.886
<i>extremely dangerous
there. partner.</i>

74
00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.627
<i>Proceed with caution
now. Tyree.</i>

75
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.848
Hah. You gonna
shoot out their tires?

76
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.155
It's half a mile away. Ranger.

77
00:07:43.332 --> 00:07:45.421
You're a good shot.
but that's impossible.

78
00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:56.780
That's six feet high.
Jesus. Alex.

79
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.623
Goddamn! That's some
shooting there. Ranger.

80
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.626
What happened? What the fuck happened?

81
00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:34.557
Shattered the block
and killed the engine.

82
00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:38.082
Takes a big round to do that.

83
00:08:51.313 --> 00:08:54.272
Save your ammo!
You're not getting a shot at that range.

84
00:08:54.316 --> 00:08:55.578
Are they shootin' at us?

85
00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:02.280
We shot at him.
so he shot back. you dumb fuck.

86
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.547
I'm leaving you. Tom.

87
00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:10.288
You look after the horses.

88
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:12.639
but know this.

89
00:09:12.682 --> 00:09:15.467
I care more about
that horse than I do you.

90
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:35.270
I'll fire. you run.
then you cover me as I run.

91
00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:36.358
Let's fucking go.

92
00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:07.345
Agh! Fuck.

93
00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:16.659
Agh. fuck!

94
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:18.356
Fuck. fuck. fuck!

95
00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:50.127
Alex.

96
00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:55.698
He's a wanted criminal. asshole.

97
00:10:55.742 --> 00:10:57.613
I don't care
if he lives or dies.

98
00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.833
Thanks a lot. brother man.

99
00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:05.752
You got me.

100
00:11:38.088 --> 00:11:40.743
Damn! Have I saw
a shooting like that before.

101
00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:43.528
Radio call said there
were four men. Ranger.

102
00:11:43.572 --> 00:11:44.834
You gonna go
after the other guy?

103
00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:49.404
Yeah. that other one
won't get far on his own.

104
00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:51.145
Now you'll be letting me go.
huh. Ranger?

105
00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:53.713
You going to jail. Tom.

106
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.523
I did suggest he knock first.

107
00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:08.831
He was concerned since you
weren't answering your phone.

108
00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:12.661
That man is Special Agent
Derby of the FBI.

109
00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:15.446
British Intelligence.

110
00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:18.493
I take it you're
Ranger Alex Tyree?

111
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.409
Major Edwards said
we could find you here.

112
00:13:24.151 --> 00:13:26.762
We'd like to come in
for a chat. if that's okay.

113
00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:36.250
You all right?

114
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.427
Give me two minutes.

115
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:46.651
British Intelligence?

116
00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:49.829
We're here with the approval
of your State Department.

117
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.484
Special agent Derby
was tasked with making sure

118
00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:55.269
I didn't get into trouble.

119
00:13:55.312 --> 00:13:58.228
Well. he's lucky I didn't
shoot him through the door.

120
00:13:59.012 --> 00:14:00.840
You have a lot
of enemies. Ranger?

121
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.366
I put people in jail.

122
00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:07.368
They tend to take
offense to that.

123
00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:10.850
I realize you have
a different way

124
00:14:10.893 --> 00:14:12.895
of handling things here. Ranger.

125
00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:16.333
And it can be quite
difficult to grasp from a desk in London. but...

126
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.860
we're very aware of the elite
investigative skills

127
00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:24.124
of the Texas Rangers.
and we know what you do works.

128
00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:28.519
We're not some cowboy
operation. Agent Smith.

129
00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:34.438
We go by the book.
just like they do in London.

130
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:36.963
I'm here because
Major Edwards said

131
00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:38.486
you're the best ranger
he's ever seen.

132
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:42.229
so I've been sent to ask you
to go into Mexico

133
00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:43.404
and collect a prisoner.

134
00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:47.625
Federales won't allow
an official British or US extraction.

135
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:49.932
but unofficially.
they've asked for you.

136
00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:52.282
You'll be there
as a private citizen.

137
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:55.285
If anything goes wrong.
our association will be basically deniable

138
00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:56.939
in every conceivable way.

139
00:14:56.983 --> 00:14:59.768
It's been nice meeting you.
Agent Smith.

140
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:00.987
Excuse me?

141
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.467
You got the wrong moron. lady.

142
00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:05.339
Crossed the border myself.

143
00:15:05.382 --> 00:15:06.818
Federales laughed in my face

144
00:15:06.862 --> 00:15:09.082
when I told them I was there
to extradite a prisoner.

145
00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:12.868
I'm late for work.

146
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.783
Carmen here will see you out.

147
00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:17.525
The prisoner in question
is the bank robber

148
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:20.397
who killed the three deputies
in Esperanza County.

149
00:15:23.052 --> 00:15:24.532
What is he to you?

150
00:15:24.575 --> 00:15:27.013
His name is Declan McBride.

151
00:15:27.056 --> 00:15:28.579
Ex-provisional IRA

152
00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:31.495
wanted for a string
of terrorist activities

153
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:33.671
on and off the British mainland.

154
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:37.066
He's extremely vicious
and very resourceful.

155
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.329
And if we don't move quick.

156
00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:42.419
he will find a way
to negotiate himself out prison.

157
00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:45.335
And what's an Irishman
doing robbing banks in Texas?

158
00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.512
Well. he's gone rogue.
charging a small fee to rob banks

159
00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:52.125
and passing the proceeds
to the worst criminal causes imaginable.

160
00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:54.910
Through his old partner.

161
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:58.522
we found out he's planning
a job on the British mainland.

162
00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:03.092
I'm asking you to do this
on behalf of my country.

163
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:28.378
The English agents
insulted my intelligence

164
00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.380
by attempting
to threaten me. Alex.

165
00:16:31.207 --> 00:16:33.862
I was tempted not to give him
an extradition at all.

166
00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:35.559
but then I thought of you.

167
00:16:35.603 --> 00:16:37.735
I remembered you helped me
with a situation

168
00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:40.129
that was very delicate.

169
00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:43.828
That small act
had large consequences.

170
00:16:43.872 --> 00:16:45.874
It made me indebted to you.

171
00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:47.354
Today I pay you back.

172
00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:51.227
The simple extradition
will be now a deportation.

173
00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:54.578
and the paperwork
is already filled out.

174
00:16:54.622 --> 00:16:55.579
Right.

175
00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:04.936
Thanks for the hospitality.

176
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.634
Mexico's a lovely place.

177
00:17:06.677 --> 00:17:08.375
You're welcome.

178
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.665
I can make it
worth your while if you drop me off here.

179
00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:39.058
Save your breath. partner.

180
00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:56.510
I'm sorry
about the police officers.

181
00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:58.338
Genuinely am.

182
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.514
but I acted in the cause
of a greater good.

183
00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.995
How much more
of this is off-road?

184
00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:06.346
Less than ten miles.
we'll be at the border cross.

185
00:18:06.389 --> 00:18:09.000
Twenty minutes from there
we'll be in Nuevo Laredo.

186
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:13.222
You know who led the first
successful revolution against colonial empire?

187
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:15.094
Huh?

188
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.183
George fucking Washington.

189
00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:20.838
See. justice is just
your perspective. Ranger.

190
00:18:21.578 --> 00:18:24.973
Elements working here are far
bigger than the two of us.

191
00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:27.758
You talk more than my ex-wife.

192
00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:29.369
Shame
of it is. Ranger.

193
00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:31.675
I think I'd have liked
going up against you.

194
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:27.078
Good to see you again. boss.

195
00:19:27.122 --> 00:19:28.254
No injuries?

196
00:19:28.297 --> 00:19:29.603
Only my pride. brother.

197
00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:32.519
I told you. the bank robbery
was a bad idea.

198
00:19:32.562 --> 00:19:35.217
Next time I'll listen.
Go get that cop.

199
00:19:43.094 --> 00:19:45.096
That's our cue. Oleg.

200
00:19:45.923 --> 00:19:47.229
He's seen your face.

201
00:19:47.273 --> 00:19:48.491
Choose your battles.

202
00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:12.880
Two faces

203
00:21:12.923 --> 00:21:14.838
that warm the heart

204
00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:17.624
with memories of conflict past.

205
00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:22.150
We have walked through
the dark as friends.

206
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:30.550
Which is better than to walk
through the light alone.

207
00:21:33.204 --> 00:21:34.336
Yuri.

208
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.904
Declan. You will stay.

209
00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:38.122
I have food

210
00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:41.387
and Ukrainian vodka.

211
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.954
My men are peasants
but they raid well.

212
00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:46.348
Come.

213
00:21:46.392 --> 00:21:49.133
We will toast to comrades lost.

214
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:58.882
It is unwise to refuse
the generosity of Cossack.

215
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.321
lest they change their minds.

216
00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:04.366
Appreciate the invitation.

217
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.325
We're on the job
. brother.

218
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:08.544
So it is business.

219
00:22:08.588 --> 00:22:10.807
Mm-hmm.

220
00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:20.251
So. gentlemen.

221
00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:26.736
Cold War
155-millimeter-long gun.

222
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.610
It will fire
100-pound projectile

223
00:22:30.653 --> 00:22:32.829
14 miles on good day.

224
00:22:32.873 --> 00:22:34.265
And on a bad day?

225
00:22:34.309 --> 00:22:35.615
On bad day.

226
00:22:35.658 --> 00:22:38.748
it will be the nightmare
that ends your life

227
00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:40.315
before you hear the sound.

228
00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:43.318
Have your men deliver
to this address.

229
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.581
I'll take it from there.

230
00:22:51.544 --> 00:22:52.675
You know.

231
00:22:55.417 --> 00:23:00.379
I worry that you will upset
many people with this toy.

232
00:23:01.728 --> 00:23:03.686
I like you. Declan.

233
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.427
You are like brother.

234
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:11.172
But when this job is over.
then so are we.

235
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.139
I expected you to look worse.

236
00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:29.364
You got a lot of nerve. lady.

237
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.235
You've every right
to be indignant.

238
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:33.194
You were ambushed.
likely set up.

239
00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:37.503
but you did your job. and
thank God you're still alive.

240
00:23:37.546 --> 00:23:39.766
Thank God I'm alive.

241
00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:42.421
Ranger Daniels was a good man.

242
00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:45.902
He was a husband. father.

243
00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:49.340
and a damn fine lawman.

244
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:52.039
He was also my friend.

245
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:55.346
I'm sorry.

246
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.435
Sorry?

247
00:23:58.393 --> 00:24:00.134
That ain't gonna cut it.

248
00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:02.528
But work with me. Tyree.

249
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:04.225
Help me bring in McBride.

250
00:24:04.268 --> 00:24:07.054
You've seen him close-up.
talked to him.

251
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:08.969
You know him better than
anyone else we have.

252
00:24:09.012 --> 00:24:10.536
I doubt that.

253
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:12.886
You knew they were gonna try
to spring him. didn't you?

254
00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:18.152
Need to get yourself
another errand boy. lady.

255
00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:20.415
If I go after McBride.

256
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.983
it's gonna be under my terms.

257
00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:25.725
with my men. and my rules.

258
00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:28.031
Just sit down. please.

259
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:30.817
Ranger Tyree. please.

260
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.907
You got one good reason
why I should help you?

261
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.171
You want a reason.
I'll give you multiple reasons.

262
00:24:37.214 --> 00:24:40.914
The 1993 killings
of US servicemen in Somalia.

263
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:43.351
The '98 bombings
of US embassies.

264
00:24:43.394 --> 00:24:45.701
The kidnapping of 16
Western tourists in Yemen

265
00:24:45.745 --> 00:24:47.486
- that same year.
- Yemen?

266
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:52.142
All executed and planned
by a man named Aden Kashmiri.

267
00:24:52.708 --> 00:24:56.538
Now. we believe Kashmiri
has retained McBride's services

268
00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:58.279
for a substantial fee

269
00:24:58.322 --> 00:25:01.630
to cause or instigate
a terrorist event in London.

270
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.808
McBride working for Kashmiri

271
00:25:05.852 --> 00:25:08.768
makes him the world's most
dangerous terrorist for hire.

272
00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:10.683
Keep talking.

273
00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:12.946
Help me track him down.

274
00:25:12.989 --> 00:25:14.600
Do what you do.

275
00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:22.390
Uh. the department
would have to sign off on it.

276
00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:26.437
and nothing really gels
around here that efficiently.

277
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:27.438
so...

278
00:25:32.095 --> 00:25:34.489
You've already talked
to the major. haven't ya?

279
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.582
Right.

280
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.770
You remind me of my dad.

281
00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:59.427
He was a police detective
in London.

282
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.168
We're in the East End.

283
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:02.778
It used to be a rough area.

284
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:06.652
He was killed on the job
when I was 17.

285
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:10.220
Mm.

286
00:26:10.264 --> 00:26:11.613
Sorry to hear that.

287
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:15.095
It was then and there I decided
to go into law enforcement.

288
00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:16.313
Ah.

289
00:26:16.357 --> 00:26:19.186
Switched college courses
to criminal science.

290
00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:21.971
was recruited straight
out of college by MI6.

291
00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.278
You did all right.

292
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:27.237
He'd approve.

293
00:26:27.281 --> 00:26:29.718
Don't underestimate
McBride. Ranger.

294
00:26:30.676 --> 00:26:35.115
Declan is a sociopathic
murderer with a genius IQ.

295
00:26:35.158 --> 00:26:38.292
Misjudged him once.

296
00:26:38.335 --> 00:26:39.598
Won't happen again.

297
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.382
I believe that.

298
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.213
I should ask.

299
00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:49.956
Do you plan on even
remotely trying to blend in?

300
00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:59.139
I guess I could lose
the hat in London.

301
00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:25.644
Section Control Geddes.
Call me Chief Control

302
00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:28.298
or just Geddes.
We're informal here.

303
00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:31.432
- Who's "we"?
- The agency.

304
00:27:31.475 --> 00:27:33.652
We who ensure the security

305
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:37.873
of the entire island nation
of Great Britain and it's Commonwealth.

306
00:27:37.917 --> 00:27:39.658
Glad you can join us.

307
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.704
Alex Tyree.

308
00:27:42.748 --> 00:27:44.793
Nice hat. very subtle.

309
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:47.361
I'll order you one.

310
00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:50.712
If you had to give a threat
assessment number out of ten.

311
00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:53.672
in your opinion. where
would Declan McBride sit?

312
00:27:53.715 --> 00:27:56.675
I don't rate 'em.
Just catch 'em and brand 'em.

313
00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:59.068
Mm. You actually talk like that.

314
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:03.290
This asshole got away
from me once.

315
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.422
I'll drop the boom
on him next time.

316
00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:08.991
You've been closer to him
than any living operative.

317
00:28:09.035 --> 00:28:11.080
you've spoken to him
and survived.

318
00:28:11.124 --> 00:28:13.996
That makes you
a temporary asset. Ranger.

319
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.870
McBride is in London.
and it's our responsibility

320
00:28:17.913 --> 00:28:20.742
to see to it
that he doesn't leave.

321
00:28:20.786 --> 00:28:22.309
Is that clear?

322
00:28:22.352 --> 00:28:24.746
Yeah. I get your drift. chief.

323
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:30.143
If you do something.
anything that reflects poorly on the agency.

324
00:28:30.186 --> 00:28:32.449
asset status terminated.

325
00:28:32.493 --> 00:28:33.799
You're on your own. son.

326
00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:37.106
Am I crystal fucking clear?

327
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.542
I'm not your son.

328
00:28:38.586 --> 00:28:40.109
And I'm not your fucking daddy.

329
00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:42.416
Just answer
the question. cowboy.

330
00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:44.200
We understand. Control.

331
00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:46.028
Thank you for accommodating us.

332
00:28:46.072 --> 00:28:48.291
And we will do everything
in our power

333
00:28:48.335 --> 00:28:50.293
to respect the agency's wishes

334
00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:52.774
and the discreet nature
of our position.

335
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:56.256
There'll be a detective
in the lobby. 7:30 a.m.

336
00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:57.823
He's your liaison.

337
00:28:57.866 --> 00:29:01.435
You are not permitted to move
around the city without him.

338
00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:04.786
That five-peso star
affords you no more rights

339
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.702
than any other guest
to this city.

340
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:10.574
Agent Smith.
you're in the UK now.

341
00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:14.100
Protocol is everything.

342
00:29:14.143 --> 00:29:15.405
Yes. Control.

343
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.889
Okay. Seven and three-eighths.

344
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:24.458
My hat size.

345
00:29:36.035 --> 00:29:39.038
Yeah?
Who said you could stop?

346
00:29:41.997 --> 00:29:43.956
You owe me more than that.
you lazy cunt.

347
00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:47.611
Always a sweet talker.

348
00:29:58.405 --> 00:29:59.798
You shouldn't have left me.

349
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.844
You got what
shouldn't be gotten.

350
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.460
I need your help. Angel.

351
00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:16.684
I know.

352
00:30:17.903 --> 00:30:20.775
Knew it when I saw you.
Knew it when you made love.

353
00:30:22.429 --> 00:30:24.605
Know it's the only reason
you're here now.

354
00:30:35.485 --> 00:30:36.530
Angel...

355
00:30:46.627 --> 00:30:48.411
Angel...

356
00:30:48.455 --> 00:30:50.022
Kid outside worships me.

357
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:53.634
I give him kale and he'll
slice you into dozen pieces

358
00:30:53.677 --> 00:30:55.244
and throw you in the Thames.

359
00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:59.031
Shouldn't have done
what you did to me.

360
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.209
Swore if I ever saw you again.
I'd fuck you back.

361
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.869
So this is it?

362
00:31:13.741 --> 00:31:16.309
You turned on too many
old friends. me included.

363
00:31:20.443 --> 00:31:21.880
Now you can leave.

364
00:31:34.109 --> 00:31:37.939
Alex Tyree.
you're in room 207. Elevator's to the left.

365
00:31:37.983 --> 00:31:40.463
- Thank you.
- Wanna walk off the cab ride?

366
00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:43.510
As opposed to a massage?

367
00:31:43.553 --> 00:31:45.207
Luke will take
any luggage for you.

368
00:31:48.558 --> 00:31:49.690
Thank you. Luke.

369
00:31:49.733 --> 00:31:50.865
With pleasure. sir.

370
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.345
Throw it on the bed.

371
00:31:57.785 --> 00:31:59.352
You call this April?

372
00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:02.050
Should've listened to Carmen
and wore a warmer jacket.

373
00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:04.574
So you staying at the hotel?

374
00:32:05.532 --> 00:32:07.229
Well. I lived in Langley
for three years.

375
00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:09.405
I don't keep a place
in the UK anymore.

376
00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:11.755
Stranger in your own town. huh?

377
00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:16.064
Geddes wants us to work
with his babysitter

378
00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:17.936
but they won't be here
till morning.

379
00:32:19.807 --> 00:32:21.940
This ain't a walk
for our health. is it?

380
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.116
It's a long shot.

381
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:26.248
There's a potential
intelligence source.

382
00:32:26.292 --> 00:32:28.207
- Taxi.
- Ah.

383
00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:33.560
Her name's Angel. ex-IRA.

384
00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:36.215
and she's got a real axe
to grind when it comes to McBride.

385
00:32:36.258 --> 00:32:38.565
Let's hope
she feels like talking.

386
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.920
Nice company
you keep. Smith.

387
00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:33.141
People looking to stay
in our good grace. you know how it is.

388
00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:34.969
No. I don't. Not really.

389
00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:37.667
I'm many things to many people.

390
00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:40.670
and today.
I get to call in a favor.

391
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:43.891
Mm-hmm.

392
00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:59.298
Long time. no see.
you British cunt.

393
00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:02.736
How are you anyway.
filthy Irish trollop.

394
00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:04.433
I was all right
until yous arrived

395
00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:06.914
stinking up my drinking space.

396
00:34:06.957 --> 00:34:08.437
Can I join you for a drink?

397
00:34:09.264 --> 00:34:11.919
Or is looking at your reflection
caused you to. you know.

398
00:34:11.962 --> 00:34:13.225
empty the bar already?

399
00:34:14.922 --> 00:34:16.489
You brought
your girlfriend here.

400
00:34:17.403 --> 00:34:19.361
Part of the States
you're from. yeah?

401
00:34:19.405 --> 00:34:20.667
Texas. ma'am.

402
00:34:21.494 --> 00:34:23.104
Great state of Texas.

403
00:34:23.148 --> 00:34:26.629
Well. you may want to invest
in some local wardrobe.

404
00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:28.718
You stand out like
a baller in sweatpants.

405
00:34:30.155 --> 00:34:32.026
I know what yous want. Smith.

406
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.681
Hmm. Bad news travels fast.

407
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.553
Get outta here.

408
00:34:37.597 --> 00:34:39.294
Give us some privacy.
you fucking apes.

409
00:34:39.338 --> 00:34:42.558
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

410
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:06.669
Don't screw me around. Angel.

411
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.107
You know me better than that.

412
00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:14.503
Sit down. Sit down.

413
00:35:16.201 --> 00:35:17.811
He's here in town. for sure.

414
00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:20.901
You're not gonna find him
without my help.

415
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:26.559
Why should I believe anything
you have to say about him?

416
00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:28.648
You're hardly
a disinterested party.

417
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:30.040
I know what you're implying.

418
00:35:30.084 --> 00:35:31.999
but anything between
McBride and me died

419
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:33.696
when he took my fucking eye.

420
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.700
Hmm. 'Cause I heard he saved
your life after the attack

421
00:35:37.744 --> 00:35:38.832
where you lost your eye.

422
00:35:39.528 --> 00:35:41.226
You heard fucking wrong.

423
00:35:41.269 --> 00:35:45.273
You expect me to believe
that any animosity you have for McBride

424
00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:48.189
is motivation enough
to sully your reputation?

425
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.020
- I want money.
- Ah.

426
00:35:53.063 --> 00:35:54.326
Cash money.

427
00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:56.197
Man's fucking dangerous.

428
00:35:56.241 --> 00:36:00.027
So in addition. I'll be wanting
three men released.

429
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.248
Not parole. but released.

430
00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:06.164
These lads need a clean record
to get their year citizenship.

431
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:09.167
So much harder since 9/11.

432
00:36:12.387 --> 00:36:14.607
You can appreciate that.
don't you. Ranger?

433
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:17.871
You don't have anything.

434
00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:21.222
I can negotiate
a visa entry.

435
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.925
And arrange for leniency.
customs and immigrations

436
00:36:28.969 --> 00:36:31.189
in extenuating
circumstances. you see.

437
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:33.974
You have my word on it.

438
00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:41.024
<i>You'll find McBride
when you find Oleg.</i>

439
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:45.159
<i>Checked in two days ago.
Room 27.</i>

440
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.204
Right.

441
00:36:50.817 --> 00:36:51.905
Jesus.

442
00:36:57.606 --> 00:37:01.044
You sure take me
to the nicest places. Smith.

443
00:37:01.088 --> 00:37:02.785
Just make sure
you stay behind me.

444
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:03.873
Ahh.

445
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:09.270
McBride finds out I'm in town.

446
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:13.970
he'll go Casper on us.
which gives us hours not days.

447
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:17.496
And time is of the essence.

448
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:21.326
What is that?

449
00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:26.156
They told me to leave
my .45 at home.

450
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.811
You are just an observer
here. Tyree.

451
00:37:28.855 --> 00:37:30.465
Study shows it's a lot
more dangerous

452
00:37:30.509 --> 00:37:32.598
when law enforcement are armed.

453
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:34.600
Weren't dangerous.
wouldn't need one.

454
00:37:41.563 --> 00:37:44.740
You think your sweet talking
Irish friend set us up?

455
00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:47.830
That's always a possibility.
Check that way.

456
00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:25.912
What a rat's nest.

457
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.222
Football.

458
00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:05.386
This is CSI Smith.
We need backup.

459
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.345
223 Green Street. Hackney.

460
00:39:07.388 --> 00:39:09.303
We have one armed suspect.

461
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:10.522
Automatic weapon.

462
00:39:10.565 --> 00:39:12.785
He has a gun.
We are receiving fire.

463
00:39:23.273 --> 00:39:25.145
You should have killed me
when you had the chance. you motherfucker.

464
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.557
Stop! Stop! You fucking freeze.

465
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.647
Don't you fucking dare. Agh!

466
00:39:51.737 --> 00:39:53.956
Fuck! You okay?

467
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.349
Go. Go.

468
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:04.837
Hold it! Freeze!

469
00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:14.803
- You all right. mate?
- Tyree. cease fire! Civilian!

470
00:40:21.157 --> 00:40:22.811
Police! Drop your gun! Now!

471
00:40:22.855 --> 00:40:24.900
No! This is MCA
official business.

472
00:40:24.944 --> 00:40:27.816
We're on active assignment.
Check my ID. Check it.

473
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:44.137
Technical branch
performed a digital forensic

474
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.748
on the cell phone
you acquired. Smith.

475
00:40:46.792 --> 00:40:49.403
Belongs to Oleg Jakovenko.

476
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:54.452
McBride's second in command.
a worthy target of opportunity.

477
00:40:54.495 --> 00:40:56.889
Tragic that you
let him slip away.

478
00:40:58.499 --> 00:41:02.372
If Jakovenko is in London.
then McBride's nearby.

479
00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:05.419
Give me access to the data.
let me find him. Control.

480
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:11.338
An arresting officer
has already gone on record

481
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:14.994
saying that someone
in a cowboy hat

482
00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:20.521
fired shots at a fleeing suspect
in a crowded area.

483
00:41:20.565 --> 00:41:25.657
Even allowing for certain
quaint West Texas customs.

484
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:29.530
uh. wouldn't you agree that
that was quite reckless?

485
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:33.360
Last time I saw him.

486
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:36.276
he murdered my friend
and partner. chief.

487
00:41:39.192 --> 00:41:41.455
You don't forget a man
does that to you.

488
00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:48.897
Give me something that I can
take to the agency executive.

489
00:41:48.941 --> 00:41:52.118
Parliamentary council
is breathing down their necks.

490
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:56.601
Nobody enjoys parrying
questions from Etonians

491
00:41:56.644 --> 00:41:59.647
with no concept
of field intelligence.

492
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.956
They're actually already talking
about a possible scapegoat.

493
00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:07.699
Any reason I shouldn't
give them one?

494
00:42:07.742 --> 00:42:09.309
Ranger Tyree is the only asset

495
00:42:09.352 --> 00:42:11.833
that's seen Declan McBride
in person.

496
00:42:11.877 --> 00:42:14.096
We're British Intelligence.

497
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.577
We have considerable
assets. don't we?

498
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:17.970
Use them.

499
00:42:18.013 --> 00:42:20.973
Convince me that
you are the right team

500
00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:22.452
for this assignment.

501
00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.759
I need concrete evidence

502
00:42:24.803 --> 00:42:27.545
that McBride is operating
on British soil.

503
00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:29.808
<i>Ad colligenda bona.</i>

504
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:32.550
Thanks. boss.

505
00:42:33.986 --> 00:42:38.120
And I will also need
a written report. Ranger Tyree.

506
00:42:38.164 --> 00:42:40.122
about yesterday's action.

507
00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:46.172
I wasn't sure what
I thought of you. chief.

508
00:42:46.215 --> 00:42:49.567
I'm just a simple
operative like you.

509
00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:52.439
Perhaps.

510
00:42:52.482 --> 00:42:56.312
I'm sure we're gonna get
along very. very well. Ranger.

511
00:42:56.356 --> 00:42:57.575
Mm-hmm.

512
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:37.658
Count it.

513
00:43:37.702 --> 00:43:38.790
I trust you.

514
00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:40.400
Don't ever trust a terrorist.

515
00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:43.316
It's just... I need
the moneys. desperately.

516
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:46.449
Mm. All men are desperate
one way or another.

517
00:43:47.842 --> 00:43:50.758
During the Troubles.
the British SAS.

518
00:43:50.802 --> 00:43:52.499
they had a Nemesis program

519
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:55.502
where they take Republican
prisoners into the woods

520
00:43:56.155 --> 00:43:57.243
and disappear them.

521
00:43:58.592 --> 00:43:59.854
never to be seen again.

522
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:04.598
I'm gonna give more to your
family than the British gave us.

523
00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:38.676
Join me for a drink. Ranger?

524
00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:42.375
My stomach's saying breakfast.

525
00:44:43.463 --> 00:44:44.856
but a drink will do.

526
00:44:54.387 --> 00:44:56.781
You got family in the UK?

527
00:44:58.565 --> 00:45:00.175
Scattered to the four winds.

528
00:45:03.526 --> 00:45:05.659
Mr. Smith. is he American?

529
00:45:07.443 --> 00:45:10.446
Oh. Mr. Smith was my father.

530
00:45:11.447 --> 00:45:15.234
Spend a lot of time in hotels.
so wedding ring's a deterrent.

531
00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:17.410
- Ah.
- I don't like small talk.

532
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:22.720
Yeah. Tough to have a laugh
doing what we do.

533
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.421
My ex-wife always wanted kids.

534
00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:32.860
I was never home long enough
to seal the deal.

535
00:45:34.644 --> 00:45:36.385
By the time I was ready.

536
00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:39.084
she'd already left me.

537
00:45:40.215 --> 00:45:42.914
Yeah. I wouldn't have
a relationship in this line of work.

538
00:45:42.957 --> 00:45:43.915
Mm.

539
00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:49.529
My father left a unfixable
void when he died.

540
00:45:50.573 --> 00:45:51.618
It's not fair.

541
00:45:54.577 --> 00:45:58.320
What would your next step be
if we were in Texas?

542
00:45:58.364 --> 00:45:59.408
Hunt him

543
00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:01.497
relentlessly.

544
00:46:03.412 --> 00:46:05.937
I convinced technical branch

545
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.549
to share the data transcript
from Oleg's phone.

546
00:46:11.377 --> 00:46:13.118
We were able to trace a number.

547
00:46:14.554 --> 00:46:17.165
Initiative. Smith. I like it.

548
00:46:18.471 --> 00:46:19.907
Here's to that.

549
00:46:29.917 --> 00:46:31.919
Thank you
for your hospitality.

550
00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:18.270
They'll have
more reinforcements. We have to move!

551
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:22.883
Get to the street
and don't look back. Go.

552
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.048
Come on. let's have you.

553
00:47:57.091 --> 00:47:58.310
The woman shot me.

554
00:47:58.353 --> 00:47:59.485
Get the fuck in.

555
00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:16.415
It's gonna sting.

556
00:48:16.458 --> 00:48:18.112
- All right.
- Ugh.

557
00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:19.809
- You're tough.
- Mm.

558
00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:23.422
- There we go.
- They targeted us.

559
00:48:24.075 --> 00:48:25.772
That means we've got
their attention.

560
00:48:25.815 --> 00:48:28.296
Well. if he's smart.

561
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.257
he'll cancel whatever plans
he has and break camp.

562
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.562
Then we've lost him.

563
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:37.827
You need to rest this arm.

564
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:39.568
Your system's going into shock.

565
00:48:41.962 --> 00:48:45.923
You'll get sleepy.
but that's okay. I'll be here.

566
00:48:49.056 --> 00:48:50.579
All right. little press.

567
00:48:50.623 --> 00:48:52.886
Ah.

568
00:48:55.845 --> 00:48:56.890
Hm.

569
00:49:00.328 --> 00:49:01.939
You did good today.

570
00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:06.813
Went against him
when he had you dead to rights.

571
00:49:08.293 --> 00:49:10.948
Yeah. you saved my life.

572
00:49:12.384 --> 00:49:16.127
Gave. uh. them folks
a reason to run.

573
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:20.087
Probably got yourself into
a lot of trouble with Control.

574
00:49:20.131 --> 00:49:22.089
That takes guts.

575
00:49:22.133 --> 00:49:24.222
With that little pistol too.

576
00:49:24.265 --> 00:49:26.311
Don't knock my little pistol.

577
00:49:26.354 --> 00:49:28.661
I'm gonna dig us up some grub.

578
00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:31.446
Shock wears off. it leaves
a hell of an appetite.

579
00:49:32.447 --> 00:49:34.319
Thank you. Ranger.

580
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:36.756
Alex.

581
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:39.411
Thank you. Alex.

582
00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:40.847
Don't want you coming after me

583
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:42.675
with that little
pistol of yours.

584
00:49:51.292 --> 00:49:52.772
Ah. There you go.

585
00:49:57.603 --> 00:49:59.692
Here. Drink will make you
feel better.

586
00:50:01.737 --> 00:50:03.565
Here you go.

587
00:50:03.609 --> 00:50:05.654
Reggie. bring that down
to the man.

588
00:50:05.698 --> 00:50:07.308
Good boy.

589
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:22.280
I have fond memories
of our time together. Declan.

590
00:50:22.323 --> 00:50:24.282
but I can't say I'm happy
about seeing you

591
00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:25.805
under these circumstances.

592
00:50:25.848 --> 00:50:27.067
We need to talk.

593
00:50:29.504 --> 00:50:30.636
In front of the boy?

594
00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:32.551
Ah. don't worry about him.

595
00:50:32.594 --> 00:50:35.249
Our special. sweet-minded boy.

596
00:50:35.293 --> 00:50:37.077
God chose to touch his mind.

597
00:50:39.123 --> 00:50:40.863
Declan...

598
00:50:40.907 --> 00:50:43.736
what you do now.
you do for the love of chaos.

599
00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:45.738
It's not what you were.

600
00:50:45.781 --> 00:50:47.740
We were part of something
bigger than us.

601
00:50:47.783 --> 00:50:51.918
There's a certain grace
in crusading for lost causes.

602
00:50:51.961 --> 00:50:53.876
I'm finished
with lost causes. doc.

603
00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:59.273
Reggie. give us
a song. will you?

604
00:50:59.317 --> 00:51:01.797
"The Foggy Dew." Good lad.

605
00:51:01.841 --> 00:51:03.669
I thought you said
he didn't talk.

606
00:51:03.712 --> 00:51:07.586
He doesn't talk.
but he does sing.

607
00:51:07.629 --> 00:51:13.548

608
00:51:13.592 --> 00:51:18.249

616
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:55.286
Good lad. good lad. Well done.

617
00:51:58.811 --> 00:52:00.247
Angel's been talking.

618
00:52:01.596 --> 00:52:05.383
Three of our men.
prisoners in Belmarsh Prison

619
00:52:05.426 --> 00:52:08.081
had their sentences exonerated.

620
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.430
Word on the street...

621
00:52:11.084 --> 00:52:13.042
diplomatic pressure from above.

622
00:52:13.695 --> 00:52:15.349
If you got something to say.

623
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.569
then you spit it out.

624
00:52:18.613 --> 00:52:20.180
You're on your own now. Declan.

625
00:52:20.224 --> 00:52:23.357
everyone is turning
against you. even her.

626
00:52:24.358 --> 00:52:25.490
Even your angel.

627
00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:26.839
You don't know anything.

628
00:52:26.882 --> 00:52:28.710
What I did for your friend
over there

629
00:52:28.754 --> 00:52:30.669
is my repayment
to the debt I owe you.

630
00:52:32.671 --> 00:52:34.151
When you leave here tonight.

631
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:38.111
don't ever come back.

632
00:52:54.867 --> 00:52:55.911
Bingo.

633
00:53:02.962 --> 00:53:04.137
Oh.

634
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.921
I found us some food.

635
00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:07.532
if you can call it that.

636
00:53:07.575 --> 00:53:08.620
Listen.

637
00:53:09.664 --> 00:53:12.014
I had a friend
dig a little deeper

638
00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:14.234
- on Oleg Jakovenko.
- Oh. yeah?

639
00:53:14.278 --> 00:53:16.889
Sentenced to 40 years
hard labor

640
00:53:16.932 --> 00:53:20.240
in Lukianivska Prison
for war crimes.

641
00:53:20.284 --> 00:53:21.981
Here. you should eat something.

642
00:53:22.024 --> 00:53:23.287
I don't eat pork.

643
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:25.637
He escaped with McBride
and two other prisoners.

644
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.378
and during the escape.

645
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:29.945
Oleg killed the two guards
who were watching McBride.

646
00:53:31.338 --> 00:53:34.167
Yeah. sounds like
a real charmer.

647
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.560
Oh. yeah.

648
00:53:35.603 --> 00:53:39.390
Interpol alert for Northern
Ireland. Libya. Iran.

649
00:53:39.433 --> 00:53:41.696
Chechnya. Bosnia. Rwanda.

650
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.222
I mean. the list reads like
a soldier of fortune world tour.

651
00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:48.355
Look. McBride's
planning something.

652
00:53:48.399 --> 00:53:50.531
But why did he break cover
to kill you?

653
00:53:51.532 --> 00:53:53.230
Well. he ain't special.

654
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:57.103
I bring him in.
head down over the saddle.

655
00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:59.497
just like any other horse thief.

656
00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:02.630
I forget that's how
you actually speak.

657
00:54:04.719 --> 00:54:06.982
I had an instructor
used to tell us.

658
00:54:07.026 --> 00:54:09.420
there's two types in this game.

659
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:13.685
Those on the run.
and those doing the hunting.

660
00:54:15.077 --> 00:54:18.080
And. man. McBride's a man
on the run. that's all.

661
00:54:18.124 --> 00:54:19.560
Hmm.

662
00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:23.695
The address on the Ukrainian
cell phone could be nothing.

663
00:54:25.653 --> 00:54:26.698
Wanna go look?

664
00:54:32.878 --> 00:54:35.794
What could possibly
go wrong?

665
00:54:48.763 --> 00:54:51.462
I'm thinking maybe
this is McBride's safe house.

666
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:53.899
We bust enough of 'em.

667
00:54:53.942 --> 00:54:56.989
think it'll get us back
in good graces with Control?

668
00:55:08.479 --> 00:55:11.569
Get off the phone.
Get off the fucking phone.

669
00:55:11.612 --> 00:55:12.918
- And who the fuck are you?
- Ah.

670
00:55:14.006 --> 00:55:15.834
- Get off the phone.
- What the fuck are you doing?

671
00:55:15.877 --> 00:55:18.271
- Get up.
- What are you-- Ow!

672
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:21.361
Anya. who did you call?

673
00:55:21.405 --> 00:55:23.363
Fucking Tooth Fairy.
Who do you think?

674
00:55:23.407 --> 00:55:26.323
- He's upstairs.
- How did you know?

675
00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:29.978
Well. he's written
"Russian gangster. Room 212" right here.

676
00:55:30.022 --> 00:55:32.981
- Seriously?
- I did not fucking write that.

677
00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:34.809
Sit the fuck down.
Don't fucking move.

678
00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:35.941
Fucking hell.

679
00:55:40.293 --> 00:55:41.381
Yes. ma'am.

680
00:55:42.948 --> 00:55:44.689
Getting that déjà vu feeling.

681
00:55:44.732 --> 00:55:46.386
You wanna call for backup?

682
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:47.692
Please.

683
00:55:47.735 --> 00:55:49.258
Don't touch any firearms.

684
00:56:03.664 --> 00:56:05.579
Did he really write
"Russian gangster"?

685
00:56:05.623 --> 00:56:08.147
No. I just wanted
to see his reaction.

686
00:56:09.714 --> 00:56:12.543
This is the only occupied room.

687
00:56:15.415 --> 00:56:17.461
Freedom fighting is many things.

688
00:56:18.462 --> 00:56:20.072
but glamorous it isn't.

689
00:56:33.215 --> 00:56:36.393
Irishman's tied
a tin can to our tail.

690
00:56:38.177 --> 00:56:40.832
Fuck. Fire escape?

691
00:56:40.875 --> 00:56:42.964
Nah. he'd have thought of that.

692
00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:44.052
So?

693
00:56:45.097 --> 00:56:46.577
We got the advantage.

694
00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:48.448
How's that?

695
00:56:52.147 --> 00:56:54.062
He thinks he got the drop on us.

696
00:56:54.106 --> 00:56:55.455
On my mother's.
I catched him.

697
00:56:55.499 --> 00:56:57.544
I won't tell him a word.
I promise.

698
00:56:57.588 --> 00:56:58.937
Please. they came
bowling in here.

699
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.460
I didn't even get
a fucking chance to speak.

700
00:57:00.504 --> 00:57:02.027
They took my phone
off me and all.

701
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.291
Oh. God!

702
00:58:04.568 --> 00:58:06.091
Have you stopped
shooting my men?

703
00:58:08.093 --> 00:58:10.182
Becoming very difficult
to find gunmen.

704
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.881
But after these ones.
what am I gonna do?

705
00:58:13.925 --> 00:58:15.753
Put your fucking hands up!

706
00:58:23.761 --> 00:58:26.328
I knew you weren't dead
when I left you in desert.

707
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:29.854
I told him it was a mistake
not to finish you.

708
00:58:31.159 --> 00:58:33.684
Will you
pass me a napkin. Ranger?

709
00:58:36.382 --> 00:58:37.557
Something in my eye.

710
00:58:53.007 --> 00:58:55.357
Why are you
with this outfit. Oleg?

711
00:58:56.881 --> 00:59:00.537
Discretion is like
the calcium in my bones. Ranger.

712
00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:07.848
You could help me
bring him in.

713
00:59:10.808 --> 00:59:13.767
When you're in Texas. we say.

714
00:59:14.899 --> 00:59:17.945
first to talk
is the first to walk.

715
00:59:18.685 --> 00:59:22.080
He's waited a long time
to see this city burn.

716
01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:56.887
- Stop!
- Government agent.

717
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.585
I got a government agent here.

718
01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:01.195
You do fine. easy fellas.

719
01:02:02.457 --> 01:02:04.155
One suspect.

720
01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:06.766
I have an injured suspect
wearing an IED explosive vest.

721
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.289
We need a bomb squad here now!

722
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.682
Go get 'em. fellas.

723
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.097
An embarrassing result.

724
01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.751
Ah. we look good together.

725
01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.624
Uh. perhaps not
the kind of image

726
01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:41.932
the agency is hoping to purvey.

727
01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:45.544
Can either of you give me
a reason why I don't punish you

728
01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:48.068
to the full extent
of my authority?

729
01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:52.246
We except full responsibility
for the indiscretion. Control.

730
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.162
An explanation will be outlined
in detail in my report.

731
01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:56.250
Mm-hmm.

732
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:00.777
You've had a promising
career up to now. Agent Smith.

733
01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:06.217
Expert in diplomatic
protocol and procedure.

734
01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.048
Frankly. I am shocked
by your reckless behavior.

735
01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.485
Having said that.

736
01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:17.358
evidence we recovered led us
to a nuclear scientist

737
01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:19.926
with a painkiller addiction.

738
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.322
It seems that he sold a quantity

739
01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:29.283
of high isotope
uranium 235 to McBride.

740
01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:31.068
He's making a dirty bomb?

741
01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:34.375
We're putting every agent
in the field.

742
01:03:34.419 --> 01:03:38.597
Intel says McBride will be
ready to strike next week.

743
01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:40.686
We need to get to work then.

744
01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:45.517
Eleven EOD has one
of your shooters in isolation.

745
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.086
He was wearing a suicide vest
that failed to detonate.

746
01:03:49.129 --> 01:03:51.436
Fortune favors the bold.

747
01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:54.961
Drop a logistics waiver
and get over there.

748
01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:57.094
Quickish.

749
01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:07.017
Information on the
prisoner's family.

750
01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.714
Tell me
about the ordinance.

751
01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:10.324
Layered PD4 derivative.

752
01:04:10.368 --> 01:04:12.370
detonator enveloped
inside the accelerant.

753
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:14.720
High pressure water cutter?

754
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:19.029
There's an RDX crystal
compound on the detonator.

755
01:04:19.072 --> 01:04:21.118
safeguards against tampering.

756
01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:23.816
I haven't seen anything this
advanced since the EOD school.

757
01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:28.603
Open the security door.

758
01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:31.563
I wish to talk to the prisoner.

759
01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:39.614
This guy hear us
through this thing?

760
01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:41.181
I can turn on two-way
for you. sir.

761
01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:48.710
McBride talked you
into blowing yourself up.

762
01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:50.669
What's your family
think about that?

763
01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:53.498
"Every soul shall
have a taste of death."

764
01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:55.892
"But only on the day
of judgment

765
01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:57.894
shall you be paid in full."

766
01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:00.766
You know the words?

767
01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:01.854
I do.

768
01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:05.336
They are just
words to you.

769
01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:08.469
Gor. Gor.

770
01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:11.298
How do we find Declan McBride?

771
01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.213
You have your mission.

772
01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:16.869
Mine is to protect my family.

773
01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:21.178
Full diplomatic protection.

774
01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:24.398
They'll be in a secure location
by tomorrow morning.

775
01:05:24.442 --> 01:05:25.573
You have my word.

776
01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:31.492
He's gonna do it.

777
01:05:32.841 --> 01:05:33.973
I love them.

778
01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.063
He has left.

779
01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:39.805
What?

780
01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:42.112
He spoke about finding
a glass skylight.

781
01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:45.985
a window from a tall building.

782
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:48.466
When? Where?

783
01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.207
Overlooking the river.

784
01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.166
The ancient clock.

785
01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:56.039
Where you don't buy hope.

786
01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.171
Come what may.

787
01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.567
Today is not the end of history.

788
01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.005
No...

789
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.746
Oh. boy.

790
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:09.704
RDX relay has been engaged.

791
01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:13.360
<i>You have 30 seconds
to get out of there. Smith.</i>

792
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:14.535
Gor...

793
01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:16.450
Show them where
to find my family.

794
01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:17.712
Gor. can you disarm it?

795
01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:20.759
Gor. can you disarm it?

796
01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:23.980
Disarm it! Gor!

797
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.767
- Smith. get outta there.
- Gor!

798
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.161
<i>The agent needs
to exit the bomb bay now.</i>

799
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.872
What a waste.

800
01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:48.743
Not to his way of thinking.

801
01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:51.050
Delusions of grandeur.

802
01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:53.009
Hebephrenic schizophrenia.

803
01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:56.969
In Texas. we'd say not enough
cotton balls on a bush

804
01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.319
to haul a full trailer
to the gin...

805
01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:00.973
if you know
what I'm saying.

806
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.716
Eh. he thinks
he's one of his heroes.

807
01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:07.762
Michael Collins.
George Washington.

808
01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:10.765
Struggling against the British.
Wants fame.

809
01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:14.334
Mm. it's not much use
if you're dead or in prison.

810
01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:16.684
Mm. thought process
don't work like that.

811
01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:21.994
McKinley's assassin bought
a pearl-handled revolver

812
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:26.694
so it would look nice
in a museum next to his photo.

813
01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:29.175
It's not next week.

814
01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:31.743
It's in two days.

815
01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:33.310
April 24th.

816
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.529
The Easter Monday uprising
against the British.

817
01:07:35.573 --> 01:07:38.315
April 24th. 1916.

818
01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:41.840
Ancient clock. Big Ben
near Houses of Parliament.

819
01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:43.668
He's gonna launch a dirty bomb.

820
01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:44.799
Not bad.

821
01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:49.761
But you got there 'cause
of my comment about Michael Collins. didn't you?

822
01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:51.632
Really?

823
01:07:58.248 --> 01:08:02.861
In 1954. French forces
suffered a defeat so definitive

824
01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:05.298
that they withdrew
all colonial forces

825
01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.126
and quit the conflict
in Indochina.

826
01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:09.868
To surprise the French.

827
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.653
Viet men had attacked
from mountains overlooking the French positions.

828
01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:15.917
dismantling their artillery
and carried on bicycles

829
01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:18.137
on women's backs
up into the mountain.

830
01:08:18.181 --> 01:08:20.226
In front of me. Mr. Kashmiri.

831
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.099
is a 152-millimeter Howitzer

832
01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.797
smuggled into the country
piece by piece.

833
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.146
Reassembled

834
01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:29.366
and aimed directly
at the House of Parliament.

835
01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:33.326
<i>You have performed your task
remarkably. Brother McBride.</i>

836
01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:37.330
<i>Now I must ask you
to step away.</i>

837
01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:38.462
Step away?

838
01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:42.161
This is the single greatest
terrorist plot since 9/11

839
01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.510
and you're asking me
to stand down

840
01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:44.946
before the command performance?

841
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.514
<i>The threat is greater
than the act.</i>

842
01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:50.300
<i>Until it is proved that
we can do what we promise.</i>

843
01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:53.999
<i>we can negotiate our demands.</i>

844
01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:55.174
Demands?

845
01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:58.873
You're just another
fucking politician.

846
01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:01.006
<i>I am Aden Kashmiri!</i>

847
01:09:01.049 --> 01:09:02.573
<i>Your spiritual leader!</i>

848
01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:06.925
<i>You will do as I command
and stand down. McBride.</i>

849
01:09:06.968 --> 01:09:08.361
<i>Stand down!</i>

850
01:09:08.405 --> 01:09:11.538
<i>The blood of the prophet
runs in me. Don't do it!</i>

851
01:09:37.347 --> 01:09:38.739
I thought you'd quit.

852
01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:43.657
Killed Protestants in the name
of the Catholic faith.

853
01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.357
Buddhists in the name of China.

854
01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.881
Hindus in the name of Buddha.

855
01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.491
I killed Christians
in the name of Islam.

856
01:09:51.535 --> 01:09:52.971
and now they ask me to stop.

857
01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:02.285
Bloody religions.
To hell. them all.

858
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.295
I'll drink to that.

859
01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:18.431
The ranger will be coming.

860
01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:29.442
Time to finish old business.

861
01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:31.052
Let's go.

862
01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.026
Chopper unit with FLIR

863
01:10:48.069 --> 01:10:50.376
discovered an off-the-charts
radium deposit.

864
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.988
Requires at least
50 pounds of isotope

865
01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:55.381
to give off a reading
that intense.

866
01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:56.556
Thanks. sir.

867
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.602
I served in Kyrgyzstan
and Syria. Ranger.

868
01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.909
You don't see it.
You don't smell it.

869
01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:03.215
You don't hear it.

870
01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.173
It kills absolutely
and without warning.

871
01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:06.827
I am not sending
my men in there.

872
01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:08.742
- But I need to go in.
- Well. you can do as you wish.

873
01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:10.527
but you're gonna have to wait
until the area's evacuated.

874
01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.658
Evacuated?

875
01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:13.486
I ordered a two-mile
radius evacuated.

876
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:16.489
and when it is.
I'm hitting that building with a JDAM explosive missile.

877
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:19.187
I need time.
We need this guy alive.

878
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.886
He's our only link
to Aden Kashmiri.

879
01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:25.455
A JDAM missile
will take out the entire block.

880
01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:26.978
Give me two rocket launchers

881
01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:28.675
on the building
across the street.

882
01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:30.024
and wait for my order.

883
01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:34.638
<i>I can give you 30 minutes. Smith.</i>

884
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.857
<i>and then we're hitting
the building whether you're out or not.</i>

885
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:37.945
<i>Am I clear?</i>

886
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.908
We need to be careful.

887
01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:46.040
We don't want McBride
triggering this thing.

888
01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:49.305
We'll catch him
like a rabbit.

889
01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:51.829
Cage will be on him
before he knows what hit him.

890
01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.209
I'll take care of this guy.

891
01:12:25.602 --> 01:12:27.821
I'll go upstairs.
I'll wait for you.

892
01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.715
Security building's
been breached.

893
01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.983
By a tall piece of piss
wearing a ten-gallon hat.

894
01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.074
Oleg will take care of it.

895
01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:06.947
Move out.

896
01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:13.954
Ranger.

897
01:13:17.741 --> 01:13:18.959
We're getting old.

898
01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:23.007
and the men we break in
are just getting younger.

899
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.227
I drink vodka in the morning
to ease the pain of a long life.

900
01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:32.669
<i>Is that machine gun fire I'm hearing. Smith?</i>

901
01:13:32.712 --> 01:13:34.671
I need more time. lieutenant.
you gotta give me something.

902
01:13:34.714 --> 01:13:36.063
<i>You have 25 minutes left.</i>

903
01:13:47.684 --> 01:13:50.774
Modern ammunition
wait for no man. Ranger.

904
01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.650
We never finished our dance.

905
01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:00.174
This is ridiculous.

906
01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:02.350
Look at us.

907
01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:06.137
Maybe. But you took my eye.

908
01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.792
Each time we meet.
you get the worst of it.

909
01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.099
Beginner's luck. Ha.

910
01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:16.103
Three times?
Throw in the towel. son.

911
01:14:16.147 --> 01:14:19.106
Maybe I got hit in the head
too many times. Ranger.

912
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:24.329
But to get to him.
you must go through me.

913
01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.233
Stay down. Oleg.

914
01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:28.409
Not possible.

915
01:16:28.453 --> 01:16:30.586
It don't need to be like this.

916
01:16:49.779 --> 01:16:50.867
Fuck.

917
01:16:52.085 --> 01:16:53.652
What the fuck?

918
01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:56.002
You look like you've
been hit by a truck.

919
01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:59.179
- I'm just an observer. Smith.
- Only that was like

920
01:16:59.223 --> 01:17:02.095
the fourth fucking time.

921
01:17:02.139 --> 01:17:04.707
Just need to catch my breath.

922
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.273
Okay. I mean. take a minute.

923
01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:10.190
- but we kind of need to go.
- I'm good to go.

924
01:17:10.234 --> 01:17:11.539
You sure?

925
01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.585
- Good to go.
- Okay. take this gun.

926
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.588
We've got 20 minutes.

927
01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.895
McBride is dug in
on the seventh floor.

928
01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:22.899
Right.

929
01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:28.992
The raw isotope has now
impregnated the explosive.

930
01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:30.950
RDD is ready for
the final mission. sir.

931
01:17:35.912 --> 01:17:38.871
I don't expect allegiance from
any of you when the job's done.

932
01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:42.658
I'll understand if you
and your men want to cut out.

933
01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:45.356
We've spoken about it.
and we stand by you.

934
01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:50.927
No one else fucking has.

935
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:55.279
Not women.

936
01:17:56.976 --> 01:17:58.064
family.

937
01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.067
even friends.

938
01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:05.028
Yous the only ones that have.

939
01:18:07.378 --> 01:18:08.553
Well. then.

940
01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:10.947
Let's get to it. shall we?

941
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.487
All 11 targets painted. ma'am.

942
01:18:30.096 --> 01:18:31.619
<i>Ready to engage
at your command.</i>

943
01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:36.886
You're a hundred percent sure
you can neutralize the threat?

944
01:18:36.929 --> 01:18:38.757
<i>They have not armed
the uranium device.</i>

945
01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:41.629
We can hit them now. but the
window closes if they arm it.

946
01:18:41.673 --> 01:18:43.153
We are on the sixth floor.

947
01:18:43.196 --> 01:18:44.807
so just keep
that fire localized.

948
01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.765
You may wanna brace
for this. Ranger.

949
01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:49.812
<i>Smith. you need to move.
Move now.</i>

950
01:18:50.682 --> 01:18:52.684
<i>We have two 84-millimeter
rocket launchers</i>

951
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.381
<i>ready to fire.</i>

952
01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.687
Fuck!

953
01:18:56.688 --> 01:18:58.211
Engage the enemy. gentlemen.

954
01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.647
Fire!

955
01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:19.842
Hit it.

956
01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:23.557
Hold your fucking fire.
I'm coming out.

957
01:20:24.689 --> 01:20:25.821
I'm coming out.

958
01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.738
I'm throwing my gun.

959
01:20:30.782 --> 01:20:32.088
We've got him.

960
01:20:43.273 --> 01:20:47.625
Declan McBride. you're not
an easy man to find.

961
01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:51.324
Why don't you show me
them hands. son?

962
01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:57.113
Here's two I prepared earlier.

963
01:20:57.156 --> 01:20:59.898
Shoot me. We'll salute
St. Michael together.

964
01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:02.335
Get on your fucking knees now.

965
01:21:02.379 --> 01:21:05.121
Careful. Ranger.
Put the gun down.

966
01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:07.514
You may be suicidal.

967
01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:09.952
Her? Not so sure.

968
01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:14.086
No matter how far
I have to track you.

969
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.566
whatever it takes.

970
01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:20.832
I guarantee I will not quit
until you're behind bars

971
01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.312
or six feet under.

972
01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:25.619
Well. then...

973
01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:27.360
Good luck to you. Ranger.

974
01:21:35.716 --> 01:21:38.154
I repeat. he's on the run.

975
01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:00.219
<i>Lost sight
of McBride. Smith.</i>

976
01:22:00.263 --> 01:22:03.092
<i>Repeat. We do not have
eyes on the target.</i>

977
01:22:03.135 --> 01:22:05.529
<i>McBride is Charlie Foxtrot.</i>

978
01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:17.280
<i>Orwell said
that people sleep peaceably in their beds at night</i>

979
01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:20.979
because rough men. and
in our case. rough women.

980
01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:25.941
stand ready to do violence
on their behalf.

981
01:22:25.984 --> 01:22:29.335
The world owes you both
a great debt of appreciation.

982
01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:33.949
and I want to thank you
on behalf of the agency.

983
01:22:35.646 --> 01:22:38.910
Agent Smith. you'll
return to your unit.

984
01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:42.131
Ranger Tyree. I assume
you'll be leaving us

985
01:22:42.174 --> 01:22:44.394
at your earliest convenience.

986
01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:46.744
Well. I am. and I will.

987
01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:49.442
Happy trails.

988
01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:51.618
I'll be checking my mail.

989
01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.881
Seven and three-eighths
cattleman.

990
01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:55.274
You want boots to go with it?

991
01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:57.842
Just the hat. Ranger.

992
01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:05.458
You're not going home.
are you. Ranger?

993
01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:06.894
Ah. things...

994
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.680
ain't that simple.

995
01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.858
We're done. Good guys won.

996
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:16.208
Got your payback.

997
01:23:19.559 --> 01:23:22.780
When Ranger Daniels
graduated from the academy.

998
01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:26.523
married his high school sweetheart.

999
01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:33.008
At their wedding.
I promised her I'd look out for him.

1000
01:23:35.445 --> 01:23:37.316
That promise ended
in the dirt.

1001
01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.538
side of the road
in Laredo County. so...

1002
01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:46.238
I've got to make good on that.

1003
01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:47.544
You're going after him?

1004
01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:50.460
Don't reckon I have a choice.

1005
01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:40.205
The DEA drone
over Sinaloa. Mexico

1006
01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:43.078
spotted what they think
is a smuggling outfit

1007
01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.818
led by McBride.

1008
01:24:44.862 --> 01:24:46.342
They have me
deep in another project.

1009
01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:48.387
or I would be there with you.

1010
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:50.868
I'll send you all
the information we have.

1011
01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:52.217
Good luck. Alex.

1012
01:26:57.864 --> 01:26:59.301
Ranger Tyree.

1013
01:27:00.476 --> 01:27:01.955
You come all the way
down here for me?

1014
01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:06.003
It's the law of the jungle
out here.

1015
01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:08.005
You ready to commit
to that. Ranger?

1016
01:27:08.658 --> 01:27:09.920
Get your boots on.

1017
01:27:19.973 --> 01:27:21.540
You gonna kill all of us?

1018
01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:24.064
Well. I'd prefer not to.

1019
01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:27.851
You're all on your lonesome.

1020
01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:30.288
I asked you to get
your boots on.

1021
01:27:31.637 --> 01:27:33.422
Don't make me repeat myself.

1022
01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:37.034
Fine.

1023
01:27:42.735 --> 01:27:44.128
That was foolish.

1024
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.390
Agh!

1025
01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.831
Don't you have a life. Ranger?

1026
01:29:20.616 --> 01:29:23.532
There's two types
in this game. McBride.

1027
01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:28.232
Those on the run.
and those doing the hunting.

1028
01:29:30.103 --> 01:29:31.801
Dead or alive.

1029
01:29:33.542 --> 01:29:34.934
Your choice.

1030
01:29:42.202 --> 01:29:43.769
I thought so.

1031
01:29:43.813 --> 01:29:48.165
Tie something around that leg.
Use it as a tourniquet.

1032
01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:49.558
It's a long walk.

1033
01:29:52.604 --> 01:29:54.301
You got this covered. Ranger?

1034
01:29:54.345 --> 01:29:55.520
Chief.

1035
01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.916
You're gonna find a mess
of deceased smugglers back yonder.

1036
01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:01.874
Once again.
I'm indebted to you.

1037
01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:04.268
Many people
will not think it so.

1038
01:30:06.357 --> 01:30:09.578
I believe a man should always
celebrate a job well done.

1039
01:30:10.187 --> 01:30:11.275
<i>Ciggaro?</i>

1040
01:30:11.318 --> 01:30:13.799
I like your line
of reasoning. chief.

1041
01:30:16.933 --> 01:30:19.762
All right.

1042
01:30:19.805 --> 01:30:21.154
It might be
a better arrangement

1043
01:30:21.198 --> 01:30:23.069
to have the Irishman
buried with his mules.

1044
01:30:23.113 --> 01:30:24.767
You know. I'm right here. chief.

1045
01:30:25.724 --> 01:30:28.335
Might just come
to that. Ignacio.

1046
01:30:28.379 --> 01:30:31.121
I might suggest to stay
clear out of Mexico

1047
01:30:31.164 --> 01:30:33.689
for a-- a decade or so.

1048
01:30:53.883 --> 01:30:55.319
Adios. Ranger!

1049
01:30:56.363 --> 01:30:58.453
And that's all
it took to take me down?

1050
01:30:58.496 --> 01:31:00.585
One riot. and one
fucking ranger.

1051
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:02.326
Just doing my job.
