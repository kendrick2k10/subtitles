kindly lent me his News of the World.

an amusement sheet posing as a newspaper…

25
00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:40.475

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:10.130
Good evening. Scotland Yard launched
its biggest murder investigation today…

[reporter 1]
…after the discovery of bodies in London.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.968
[reporter 2] In the next few hours.

38
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.263
the scale of this crime
will begin to unfold.

39
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.894
[Nilsen] Well.
what is this article's accuracy?

40
00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.273
Oh yes.
I was definitely convicted for murder.

41
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.777
Eh. but apart from that.
most of the stuff is just pure fiction.

42

were not disappointed.

[Nilsen] Great. "Des Nilsen. the monster."

46
00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.840
"Oh. Nilsen."
As soon as you mention the name.

47
00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:55.884
people have made their mind up about it.

48
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.553
Dennis Nilsen.

56
00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.206
[Nilsen] It's a tale beyond comprehension.

Right. let's go!

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.763
London. 1983.

59
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:44.641
Good afternoon to you.

60
00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.851
Well. it's decidedly parky
to say the least.

61
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:50.230
And. in fact. it's not gonna get
any warmer. really. in the next few days

62
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.899
because we're going to keep
these north to northeasterly…

63
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:58.196
[McCusker] I certainly remember the day
because it was cold and miserable outside.

64
00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.323
and I was sitting in my office

65
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.493
when a colleague of mine told me

66
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.246
that he had been called
to Cranley Gardens.

67
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:11.626
where suspected human remains
were pulled out of a manhole there.

68
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.181
When we got there. the tenants
were standing around the manhole.

69
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.684
The toilets had been blocked.

70
00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.813
and an engineer had been called
to clear the drains.

71
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:36.276
and he discovered
huge amounts of flesh and bone.

72
00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.403
I have a limited knowledge.

73
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.989
but very heavily suspected

74
00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:44.284
that it wasn't. um. animal. shall we say.

75
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.412
[interviewer] Did anyone express
any particular interest in what you found?

76
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:51.165
Yes. The guy. I believe.
was living in the top-floor flat.

77
00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:58.298
[McCusker] Then the tenants told me
that the previous evening.

78
00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.757
around about midnight.

79
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.719
they had heard a scraping noise outside.

80
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.263
When they went to the front door
and opened it.

81
00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.432
they saw the man from the upstairs flat.

82
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.518
He was dressed in just a simple vest.

83
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:13.771
And bearing in mind.
this was February. freezing cold.

84
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.773
And they asked him if he was all right.

85
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.193
And he said.
"I am. I've just been outside for a pee."

86
00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.906
I made further inquiries
at Cranley Gardens

87
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.286
and found out he was
at the local Jobcentre where he worked.

88
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.963
And he normally returned from his work

89
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.174
at half past five every evening.

90
00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:49.265
We then found out
that the pieces of bones from the drains

91
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:52.477
were indeed from a human body.

92
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.396
And the pathologist said
that the piece of flesh

93
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.399
appeared to have
strangulation marks on it.

94
00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.485
[tense suspenseful music playing]

95
00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.489
[McCusker] And lo and behold.

96
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.699
we saw a man walking up the road.

97
00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.957

♪ The time is coming! ♪

99
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.005
He was very calm indeed.

100
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.012
[Nilsen] When I arrived
to Cranley Gardens.

101
00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.473
the police were unsure of their ground.

102
00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:36.229
They were fishing tentatively
in the hope of gaining information

103
00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:40.191
concerning the samples of human flesh
found down the house…

104
00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:41.359
…drains.

105
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.655
Nilsen then said. "Very strange
that police officers should come

106
00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.407
and talk to me about my drains."

107
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.658
[camera shutter clicks]

108
00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.536
[McCusker] But he let us into the house…

109
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.787
[camera shutter clicks]

110
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.081
[McCusker]
…and we went up to the attic flat.

111
00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.750
[camera shutter clicks]

112
00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.128
[McCusker] And as soon
as he opened the door.

113
00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.797
the smell just came at you.

114
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.924
[camera shutter clicks]

115
00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.052
[camera shutter clicks]

116
00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.306
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[McCusker] I knew that awful smell.

117
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.350
So we said to him…

118
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:18.229
[Nilsen overlaps] "Stop messing about.
Where's the rest of the body?"

119
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.064
And he looked at me.

120
00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.691
and he pointed

121
00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.943
to the wardrobe.

122
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.240
And when I opened it.

123
00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:33.453
there were
two huge. black bin sacks. sagging.

124
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:34.745
[camera shutter clicks]

125
00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.416
[McCusker] So I got him by the cuff.

126
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:42.086
and he was told that he was being arrested
on suspicion of murder.

127
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.880
[vehicle moving]

128
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.011
[McCusker] On the way back
to the police station.

129
00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:51.262
I sat beside him.

130
00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.807
but something was bothering me.

131
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.936
Those two bin sacks were huge.

132
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:07.069
[Nilsen] In the car. on the journey
to the police station. I was asked…

133
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.031
"Are we talking
about one body or two here?"

134
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.661
[Nilsen] I immediately replied with…

135
00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.664
[overlaps with Nilsen] "15 or 16."

136
00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.920
[McCusker] It made the hair
on the back of my neck stand up.

137
00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:30.301
And I could see
the detective chief inspector

138
00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:32.553
looking into the mirror at me.

139
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.391
And I had to tell him
to concentrate on the driving

140
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.727
'cause he started to veer across the road.

141
00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.063
And it hit me.

142
00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:43.940
"We have a serial killer here."

143
00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:46.484
[menacing music plays]

144
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.195
[indistinct chattering]

145
00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:58.454
[Nilsen] I glide
down a long corridor with my escort.

146
00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:02.875
and I'm lodged in the first cell
at the end of the line.

147
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:08.381
I am deposited there.
in this antiquated room.

148
00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:10.049
with a small bench

149
00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:13.010
and rough. upright.
small stool of a table.

150
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.807
I sit there.
light up a cigarette. and pause.

151
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.268
[tense music playing]

152
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.062
[McCusker] We didn't know for sure

153
00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:26.232
if what Nilsen was telling us
was actually truthful.

154
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:29.110
You think. "15 or 16 people?"

155
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:33.656
But we've only had the authority
to keep him in custody for 48 hours.

156
00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.074
and that's it.

157
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:38.953
You've gotta get
everything out of this guy that you can.

158
00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.042
But you don't wanna put
that much pressure on him

159
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.044
that he doesn't wanna talk to you.

160
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.219
[Nilsen] Wary of the expected
long train of questioning.

161
00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:58.681
I surprised the CID trio

162
00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:02.435
by interjecting
that I would tell them everything.

163
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.606
[McCusker] Nilsen wouldn't stop talking.

164
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.902
He started telling us
exactly what had happened.

165
00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:16.741
He would go into a pub

166
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:19.952
and speak to someone.

167
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.038
take them back to his flat.

168
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.498
They would be drinking.
They'd be listening to music.

169
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.710
The following morning.
Nilsen would wake up.

170
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.920
and there would be a dead body beside him.

171
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.803
And when he was pressed on this.
he just said

172
00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:40.556
he couldn't remember what had happened.

173
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.063
Normally. in a murder case.

174
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.564
you'll have a victim.

175
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.233
and then
you will go looking for the murderer.

176
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.528
In this case. we had a murderer.

177
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.865
but he didn't know who the victims were.

178
00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:04.664
So we had to go backwards. if you like.

179
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.123
and trace all the victims.

180
00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:12.088
[Nilsen] There was no questions
I refused to answer.

181
00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:19.804
Going into minute detail.

182
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.351
If anything…

183
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.981
no other British murderer

184
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.818
has ever been so forthright…

185
00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:39.740
in confronting his offending behavior
than I have been.

186
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:49.375
He was giving very limited information.
but they were mainly young men.

187
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.129
But I thought.

188
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:56.257
if what Nilsen was telling us
was truthful.

189
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.884
how on earth. in a place like London.

190
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:02.972
could 15 people have been murdered
without anyone noticing?

191
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.310
[Nilsen]
The police had all the ingredients

192
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.104
to lay a charge against me.

193
00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:15.735
This would have placed the whole matter
under the protection of sub judice

194
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:18.779
and out of reach
of the sensation-hungry media.

195
00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:24.577
This was to be the biggest case
in all of their careers.

196
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.914
and in order to enhance their own place
in the professional public spotlight.

197
00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.792
they made sure
that the entire nation knew about it

198
00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.879
when they sat down
to their breakfast tables.

199
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:44.305
[man] I was up at the office.

200
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:48.642
and the news desk called me over
and gave me this sheet of paper

201
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:52.563
that said
that a plumber working for Dyno-Rod

202
00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:57.067
had found pieces of human flesh
down a drain.

203
00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:02.114
I phoned Scotland Yard.
but they knew nothing about it.

204
00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.742
So I carried on and wrote the story.

205
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.413
But there was resistance
to the story being used.

206
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.498
because in those days.

207
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.501
you never really wanted
to upset people over the breakfast table.

208
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.835
And there's no doubt

209
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:18.339
that the reality of Cattran's discoveries

210
00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:22.051
would make people dry heave
over their cornflakes.

211
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:29.099
So I had no idea
if the story was gonna be used.

212
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:37.316
[man 2] Well. I was told
there had been a… a murder inquiry

213
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.567
at Cranley Gardens.

214
00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:42.029
and could I get up there
as quickly as possible?

215
00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.781
Well. I wasn't too excited about it.

216
00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:46.992
I thought.
"This is a… a fairly mundane story."

217
00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:50.579
"If I'm lucky. I might get a lead that'll
get me a piece on the Six O'Clock News.

218
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.331
and it'll be forgotten."

219
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:58.796
Well. normally.
when you get to a scene like that.

220
00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:01.966
the road's already been cordoned off.
Never mind the house. the road.

221
00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:04.969
No sign of that here.
We were right up on the doorstep.

222
00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:11.517
But we did interview one or two people
who had noted him. you know.

223
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.687
They had seen him. They thought
he was a bit strange. a bit quiet.

224
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.356
[interviewer] Is he a man
whom you'd seen in this area before?

225
00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:21.151
Oh yes. I've seen him out walking his dog
and just nodded hello to him.

226
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:24.113
And then. half an hour later. uh.

227
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:27.783
we hear that this. uh… [chuckles]

228
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.953
…this killer
hasn't just killed one person.

229
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:33.831
He's killed 15 or 16.

230
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:34.874
What?

231
00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:41.463
In some ways… This sounds awful.

232
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.217
but I had this great flow
of adrenaline at the time.

233
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.344
[chuckles] I have to admit. you know.

234
00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.471
I was totally transfixed on this.

235
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.142
As yet. few in Cranley Gardens
have been able to gather

236
00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.311
the enormity of what's happened.

237
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.689
For. within hours.
what seemed just another inquiry

238
00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:02.318
developed into
one of the biggest mass murder inquiries

239
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.986
ever conducted in Britain.

240
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.613
The news editors are asking.

241
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:08.490
"What more do you know?
What more can you give us now?"

242
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.411
[Nilsen]
Nobody else knew the published details

243
00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:14.914
but for the officers on the case and me.

244
00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:19.668
As I was incommunicado.
there was no leaks from me to the press.

245
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.672
It was the police
who gave the press all the information

246
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.675
that hit the headlines
in the next couple of days.

247
00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:33.849
Then we hear that this man has a job
as an executive officer

248
00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:37.603
at a Jobcentre interviewing people!

249
00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:41.398
For the past six months. he's been working
here at the Manpower Services Commission.

250
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.068
known to his colleagues at work as Des.

251
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.363
Well. I thought. you know… [chuckles]

252
00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.531
"This guy's a psychopath. all right."

253
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.910
[Nilsen] A clearly prejudiced picture

254
00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:55.329
had been allowed to form
in the public's mind.

255
00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:57.915
even before I was charged
with any offense.

256
00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:01.168
giving the media
full latitude to milk their property.

257
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:03.629
This allowed the images of monstrosity

258
00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:05.005
to take full flight

259
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:08.801
to whet the profitable public imagination.

260
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:15.683
[Bence] As a newspaper reporter.
nothing really shocks or surprises you.

261
00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:19.228
As a human being.
things do shock and surprise you.

262
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:23.899
When I heard that he'd killed
15 or 16 people over four years.

263
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.068
I thought.
"How can that happen for four years.

264
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.070
in this so-called civilized country.

265
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.572
and we had no knowledge of it?"

266
00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:37.913
We were all talking about
how the big problem for any killer

267
00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.249
is getting rid of the body.

268
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.585
But how did he get rid of 15 or 16?

269
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.837
[camera shutter clicks]

270
00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:49.925
[McCusker] We only found the remains
of three bodies at Cranley Gardens.

271
00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:52.803
So I asked him.

272
00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:56.015
where did he kill the other people at?

273
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:03.981
[Nilsen] My memory rolled back the fact
that I killed three at Cranley Gardens

274
00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:06.442
and the others

275
00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:09.987
[overlapping with Nilsen]
at 195 Melrose Avenue.

276
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.995
[McCusker] Which is only
a few miles from Cranley Gardens.

277
00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:27.212
[woman] It was absolutely freezing.

278
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:28.756
icy cold.

279
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.010
But we got the call
from the detective chief inspector.

280
00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:35.804
who said.
"Right. everybody in. Everybody in."

281
00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:38.432
"We will go down to Melrose Avenue."

282
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.352
"We'll be briefed there."

283
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:45.647
Bear in mind we didn't know
what we were gonna walk into there.

284
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.941
There was no prep. We were the first wave.

285
00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.443
So off we went.

286
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.615
But when we got to Melrose Avenue.

287
00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:57.242
the officers
who were investigating the crime said.

288
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.578
"Right. We've had information

289
00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:03.123
Dennis Nilsen
used to live in Melrose Avenue.

290
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.254
and that he has admitted
to killing quite a few people.

291
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.090
and that they're buried in the garden."

292
00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.678
So there was this stunned silence.

293
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.598
And then we were given green overalls.

294
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.934
"There you go. Karen.
Put your overalls on."

295
00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:23.727
"There's a pitchfork. Start digging."

296
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.020
[reporter] A few minutes ago.

297
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.648
a police van
suddenly drew up outside the house.

298
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.608
and a squad of half a dozen officers.

299
00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:32.861
equipped with spades.
sieves. and other digging implements.

300
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.531
hurried down the side passage
to the back garden.

301
00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:40.119
"Find what you can. Is this guy lying.
or is he telling us the truth?"

302
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.037
He could have been a fantasist.

303
00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.627
[McCusker] Nilsen told us
about his system of disposal

304
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.088
of the bodies at Melrose Avenue.

305
00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:55.092
[Nilsen clearing throat]

306
00:18:55.968 --> 00:19:00.055
I was putting the corpses
under the floorboards…

307
00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:05.102
but eventually. there was the smell.

308
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:08.522
and the rot. and the maggots.

309
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:13.402
And at one stage.
there was no room under the floorboards.

310
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.195
There were so many bodies there.

311
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.533
He had to come up with an idea.

312
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:26.248
[Bence] I spoke to a neighbor
who said she remembers

313
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.417
that he had a series of bonfires.

314
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.044
Er. mostly in the evening time

315
00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:33.380
'cause I used to work evenings.

316
00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:35.299
Um. that's all.

317
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.843
[interviewer 1]
Did you think rubbish was being burned?

318
00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:38.760
Yes. Yes.

319
00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.263
[interviewer 2] Does it appear
that the bodies have been burnt

320
00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.890
in the back garden before burial?

321
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.308
Uh. it's a possibility.

322
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:45.559
[camera shutter clicks]

323
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:48.770
[Hunt] What he'd done
filters through to us.

324
00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.566
He burned them in the back garden.

325
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:56.278
and when they were down to ash.

326
00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.657
he would spread them out over the garden
and dig them in.

327
00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:05.037
But there would have been
regular bonfires in that garden.

328
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.498
I am unaware
of anybody making a complaint.

329
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:12.336
[reporter] The whole area
has now been completely cordoned off.

330
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.838
and newsmen ordered away from the scene.

331
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:15.964
Come on. move back!

332
00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.257
[dog whimpers]

333
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.719
It was numbing work
because the ground was frozen.

334
00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.430
I said.
"We're never gonna get through this."

335
00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:26.225
We felt we were gonna be there a year
digging that place up.

336
00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.435
[reporter] By late afternoon.

337
00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:31.605
a grim and somewhat dispirited squad
packed up and left.

338
00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:35.192
shaking their heads when asked
if the day's work had yielded anything.

339
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.654
[Hunt] Then you start asking.

340
00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:42.157
why hasn't there been this huge outcry of.

341
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.285
"Yeah. my son… My father's missing"?

342
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.411
It wasn't happening.

343
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.874
It was as if they didn't matter.

344
00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.091
[McCusker] Who were these people?

345
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:01.843
It's almost an impossible task.

346
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:07.641
But Nilsen had told us
we needed to search Cranley Gardens

347
00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:09.476
for a tea chest.

348
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.315
[camera shutter clicks]

349
00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:17.359
[camera shutter clicks]

350
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:19.444
[camera shutter clicks]

351
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.280
[camera shutter clicks]

352
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:26.118
[McCusker] And there.
we discovered more body parts…

353
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.954
-[camera shutter clicks]
-…which we took to the mortuary.

354
00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:31.748
One of the pieces
that were removed from the flat

355
00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:32.916
was an arm.

356
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:34.668
with a hand.

357
00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:41.133
We took the fingerprints of this hand.

358
00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:43.844
and we were absolutely amazed

359
00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:46.221
when we got a match.

360
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:53.312
It was a young man
by the name of. uh. Stephen Sinclair.

361
00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:58.025
He was on police records

362
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:02.195
because he had been in trouble
for various minor criminal matters.

363
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.740
but he was never reported missing.

364
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:09.161
So we made every effort
to contact any family that he had.

365
00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:18.754
[woman] One night.
we were talking about things.

366
00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:21.173
and he said
that he would love to go to London.

367
00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:23.175
that he was going to London.

368
00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:25.886
And my husband said.
"Well. Stephen. you're silly

369
00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:28.930
because it's no' a place
for a… a boy like you."

370
00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:31.141
He says. "Oh. but I'm going."

371
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.899
[McCusker] Sinclair was a drifter

372
00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:43.487
who'd come down from Scotland.
and he was swallowed up by London.

373
00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:05.384
It was beginning to look
like most of these victims were

374
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.136
homeless youths.

375
00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.222
down-and-outs.

376
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.477
It was that kind of class of people.

377
00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:21.650
[Bence] You have to look
at Britain at that time.

378
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.862
There was high unemployment
all over the country.

379
00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:28.407
The consequence of high unemployment is

380
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.368
you get people drawn like a magnet
to London.

381
00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:34.287
They think
the streets are paved with gold.

382
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.706
In fact. they're not paved with gold.

383
00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:39.960
And you get down on your luck.

384
00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:45.215
Nilsen went round with his vacuum cleaner.

385
00:23:45.715 --> 00:23:47.759
swooping up these victims.

386
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.095
these vulnerable young men.

387
00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:55.600
[reporter] Efforts to identify the victims
are centered

388
00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:58.228
among London's growing population
of young dropouts.

389
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:02.357
Police theorize the victims
were male runaways under age 21.

390
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:05.735
lured to the house with a promise
of food and a place to spend the night.

391
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.410
[Nilsen]
Leave the old autobiography alone.

392
00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.122
Now I think
it's time to go and pick up lunch.

393
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:18.790
Excusez-moi.

394
00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:29.217
All right. welcome back.
I've just collected my lunch.

395
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.928
It's a kind of a curry.

396
00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:34.431
I don't think these cooks down there
have got much of a clue.

397
00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:36.349
The curry seems to have been supplemented

398
00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:42.063
by soya. texturized protein.
simulated meat.

399
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:45.484
I'll bang some
of this West Indian sauce on top.

400
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.944
and that might give it some taste.

401
00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:50.780
Right. Let's taste this.

402
00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:56.786
[chewing]

403
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.582
Mmm! That's quite pleasant.
I'm surprised myself.

404
00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:04.544
Must have been the West Indian sauce
I put in it has given it some taste.

405
00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:08.089
Anyway. where was I? Yes.

406
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.388
1983.

407
00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:18.308
[ominous music playing]

408
00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:26.233
Good evening. A 37-year-old civil servant

409
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:29.402
has been charged
with the murder of a 20-year-old man

410
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:32.113
whose remains were found
at a house in North London

411
00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.281
earlier this week.

412
00:25:34.115 --> 00:25:37.452
Dennis Andrew Nilsen
will appear in court tomorrow.

413
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:40.288
[Nilsen] I'm crushed
inside a security van.

414
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.957
en route from prison.

415
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.166
It is the first day

416
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.253
whereon I shall stand exposed
before my peers.

417
00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:52.592
[Bence] We knew the man's name.

418
00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:54.761
but we'd never seen him.

419
00:25:54.844 --> 00:25:56.638
We had no idea what he looked like.

420
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:03.562
You expect a big. beefy fellow.

421
00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.272
Uh. strong.

422
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:07.774
You're expecting
a heavyweight boxer almost.

423
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.115
[Bence] There was press everywhere.

424
00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:18.451
waiting for the first picture
of this monster.

425
00:26:21.162 --> 00:26:22.497
I said to the photographer.

426
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.583
"He's gonna come out
with a sheet over his head."

427
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:26.001
"We're not gonna see him."

428
00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:37.762
But. of course.
he didn't have a sheet over his head.

429
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.268
[Nilsen] I am a man.

430
00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:45.395
not a monster.

431
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:48.982
Awkward. isn't it?

432
00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:53.903
It was almost a feeling of…

433
00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:56.281
It's a horrible way to put it.

434
00:26:56.364 --> 00:26:57.657
…sort of disappointment.

435
00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:59.367
Could this possibly be the man?

436
00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:05.040
He just didn't seem to fit
the picture of a mass killer.

437
00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.458
[camera shutter clicks]

438
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.127
[Bence] How could
a man like that do what he's done.

439
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.296
-this ordinary-looking bloke…
-[camera shutter clicks]

440
00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:14.841
…that you'd walk past in the street
without a second look?

441
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.261
[reporter] The van made its way
to Hornsey Police Station

442
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:20.513
where investigations are continuing.

443
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.558
[Hamilton] Obviously. now.
we want to know something

444
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.101
about Nilsen's upbringing.

445
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:29.814
Well. the only people
who can tell you that are his own family.

446
00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:35.737
We knew that he came from Aberdeenshire.

447
00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:38.782
So I looked up
the Aberdeenshire phone book.

448
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.744
and there's only one entry "Nilsen."

449
00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:49.042
And I make a telephone call
to his mother and said.

450
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:53.296
"Obviously. you know
that we've got to do a program on this."

451
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.883
And she said. "Well. not today.
I don't really feel up to it."

452
00:27:56.966 --> 00:28:00.053
I said. "Well. I just happen to be
in Aberdeenshire today."

453
00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:03.515
"Would be a bit of a shame
if we had to come back again."

454
00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:05.517
She said. "All right. then."

455
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.315
Outside her house was a little notice

456
00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:17.320
to say that her garden had been
the best garden in the whole area.

457
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:18.738
[clock ticking]

458
00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:21.908
[Hamilton] The house inside was pristine.

459
00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:25.620
Not a speck of dust anywhere.

460
00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.622
[kettle whistling]

461
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:30.667
She went into the kitchen.
She brought in a silver salver.

462
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.585
Homemade shortbread.

463
00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:41.803
And I said to her.

464
00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.513
"Well. you know. how did you…"

465
00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:46.266
"How did you feel
when you heard this news about him?"

466
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.852
And she said…

467
00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:52.355
I've tried to think
what could have gone wrong.

468
00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:56.943
And. I mean. why the people
in London who worked with him.

469
00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:59.362
why would they not see something there…

470
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:03.283
before this? It's gone on all this time.

471
00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:07.203
I believe if he'd been at home.
I would have seen something was wrong.

472
00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:10.957
Because normally.
you couldn't live with a person

473
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.294
unless you could see
that there was something bothering him.

474
00:29:15.044 --> 00:29:19.466
Because it's not the Dennis I knew
that's doing this. somehow or other.

475
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:24.679
[Nilsen] Oh dear! Deary. deary me!

476
00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:29.142
[Scott] He was really a quiet boy.

477
00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:32.562
Nothing extraordinary about him. really.
when he was young.

478
00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:34.564
Just a normal. quiet boy.

479
00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:39.527
[Nilsen] I was an inwardly troubled boy.

480
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.780
and nobody seemed to notice.

481
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.742
[gulls squawking]

482
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:52.499
[Nilsen] I remember… I remember

483
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:57.378
as if there was a Moviola
running in my mind.

484
00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:04.511
I see a small. frail boy.

485
00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:10.141
He is new against a background
of powerful forces acting on him.

486
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:15.480
[clock ticking]

487
00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:18.775
[Nilsen] I had the feeling
of being somehow different.

488
00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:24.405
Perhaps being poor.
thin. and shabbily dressed

489
00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:29.327
was that first definable assault
on my awakening self-esteem.

490
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.874
Not having a father to boast about
might well have been another.

491
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.669
[menacing music playing]

492
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.650
[Scott] His father.
he never was really a person

493
00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:03.444
that was close to the family and that.

494
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.488
I had to bring them up myself.

495
00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:09.742
[Nilsen] Then there was this great gulf
between me and my mother.

496
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:15.790
[Scott] I was a caring person.
and I just did my best.

497
00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.751
He was brought up
just the same way as the others.

498
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:20.962
[Nilsen] Well… [sighs]

499
00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:23.882
Damned lies.

500
00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:29.929
When I was about eight or nine.

501
00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:33.683
I was first afflicted
by that thing called love.

502
00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:37.687
It was for another boy
with whom I'd never even spoken.

503
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.775
Visions of him. as seen in school.
filled my whole consciousness.

504
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.991
It was a strange.
vibrant. and compelling situation.

505
00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.913
but the stern moral principles
of society and the church

506
00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:56.414
were of such a magnitude

507
00:31:56.497 --> 00:32:01.127
that my inner joys and longings
had to be kept secret from the world.

508
00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:03.129
[dance music playing in video]

509
00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:04.923
[reporter] Men who choose
to love other men

510
00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:07.550
are treated
not only with intolerance and contempt

511
00:32:07.634 --> 00:32:09.344
but prosecuted and jailed.

512
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:12.847
For many of us. this is revolting.
men dancing with men.

513
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:16.476
Most homosexuals
must lead a secret. dark existence.

514
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.903
[Nilsen] It is a great hurt

515
00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:30.573
to begin to appreciate
that one's genetic personality

516
00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:33.701
was considered
to be monstrous and detestable.

517
00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:37.997
There I was. not into my second decade.

518
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:42.418
and regarded as a criminal.
an outsider. an abomination.

519
00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:46.130
had been convicted
and punished to serve a sentence

520
00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:50.009
for the crime of what nature had made.

521
00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:53.429
I was forced not to be anything true

522
00:32:53.513 --> 00:32:54.973
outside of my head.

523
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:04.524
[McCusker] The interrogators
were happy enough

524
00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:08.194
to let Nilsen tell his story
without pressing him too much

525
00:33:08.277 --> 00:33:10.446
because he was free flowing with his talk.

526
00:33:16.619 --> 00:33:19.956
So I thought.
"I'll sit down with Nilsen myself."

527
00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:22.875
I wanted to see
if he could remember anything extra

528
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.338
about the pubs
where he picked some of the victims up.

529
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:29.966
And he told us a lot of them

530
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.469
were gay bars…

531
00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:38.975
in the West End of London.

532
00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:42.645
[Nilsen] Of course I'm homosexual.

533
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.690
but I keep myself to myself.

534
00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:48.985
The last thing
anyone would ever admit to is being gay.

535
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.741
[McCusker] So I concentrated my squad
in the West End of London.

536
00:33:57.785 --> 00:34:00.955
Then we found out
he picked up men in gay pubs.

537
00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:04.333
And once you've got something
that you can nail to it.

538
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:05.960
"the gay killer."

539
00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:07.628
it's gonna stick.

540
00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:11.257
Whatever the reality.
whatever the truth of it.

541
00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:13.259
it's gonna stick.

542
00:34:15.762 --> 00:34:16.888
[Nilsen] Exclusive!

543
00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:20.850
Gay Killer Dennis the Mincing Menace.

544
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:22.310
Oh dear.

545
00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:27.940
[Bence] Even though. in 1983.

546
00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:31.986
consenting adults of 21 and over
would no longer be prosecuted.

547
00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:34.947
gay men and women were ostracized.

548
00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:38.201
There was a lot
of institutional homophobia

549
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:42.038
in lots of aspects of Britain's society.
including the press and the police.

550
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:46.459
And as we were about to find out.
Nilsen knew that was the case.

551
00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:47.668
perfectly well.

552
00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:53.633
I remember sitting having a cup of tea

553
00:34:53.716 --> 00:34:56.594
with a member of staff
from Scotland Yard's Press Bureau.

554
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.180
and he said. "This is an amazing story.

555
00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:02.016
but it's even more amazing
'cause he's one of our own."

556
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.645
He's an ex-copper!

557
00:35:09.565 --> 00:35:10.650
[Nilsen snickers]

558
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.570
When we found out
he was a police officer. we…

559
00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:19.117
Well. I thought. "That's why
he's got away with it for so long."

560
00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:23.287
"He's a police officer.
He's gonna be one step ahead."

561
00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:27.875
There were two officers I knew.
in uniform. who'd worked with him.

562
00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:35.883
[man] The detective chief superintendent
running the inquiry ordered me

563
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.593
to come over to his office.

564
00:35:39.178 --> 00:35:41.597
'cause he wanted me
to come and tell them all about

565
00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:43.975
my friend Dennis.

566
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.271
He was one of these people.

567
00:35:48.354 --> 00:35:50.773
if you spoke to him.
he would drop his head.

568
00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:53.192
He would avoid eye contact.

569
00:35:53.276 --> 00:35:54.986
A real loner.

570
00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:59.115
He wore a uniform

571
00:35:59.198 --> 00:36:00.950
but didn't really achieve anything.

572
00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:03.077
I don't think his interest was in it.

573
00:36:05.788 --> 00:36:08.082
He went before he was pushed.

574
00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:13.462
I don't think anybody batted an eyelid.

575
00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.093
You know. there was no leaving do.

576
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:20.803
[siren sounding]

577
00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:23.347
[Brenton] And then. a few years later.

578
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.099
before he killed anybody.

579
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.768
I got a phone call
ordering me to go to an address

580
00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.937
to investigate a serious assault.

581
00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:35.943
And the first thing I noticed was
the walls had been painted black.

582
00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:39.155
which really wasn't my color.

583
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.703
The living-room window
had been completely smashed.

584
00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:47.830
and there's blood everywhere.

585
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:53.002
A young juvenile
had been taken from the address

586
00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:54.170
to the hospital.

587
00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:58.507
And he was just a pale.
skinny waif of a kid.

588
00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.261
And if I remember rightly.
he had over 100 stitches.

589
00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:06.224
He had been picked up in a pub

590
00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:12.355
by a man with a dour Scot's voice

591
00:37:14.273 --> 00:37:16.275
and was taken back to the flat…

592
00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.822
plied with alcohol.

593
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.824
and then he woke up

594
00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:27.620
and discovered
that he was completely naked.

595
00:37:27.703 --> 00:37:30.248
and this man was coming towards him.

596
00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:33.459
So. fight-or-flight.

597
00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:36.379
he just hurled himself through the window.

598
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:44.220
So I went back to the police station.
and this Scottish man was there.

599
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.554
and it was

600
00:37:46.722 --> 00:37:47.974
my friend Dennis.

601
00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.477
So I asked him.

602
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.773
"Why did this young juvenile
hurl himself through the window?"

603
00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:59.527
And then he said.
"Well. I don't know why he did it."

604
00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:03.739
"But if you got the evidence.
you charge me."

605
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.117
"If you don't. you gotta let me go."

606
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.204
And that was our Dennis. He knew the law.

607
00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:20.548
We then discovered
that the juvenile was a missing person.

608
00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.425
And we spoke to his parents.

609
00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:25.219
but his father just said.

610
00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.887
"He's not going to court."

611
00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.434
And I remember saying to his father.

612
00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:33.185
"Do you realize

613
00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:36.772
what is going to happen

614
00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:40.109
if you do not bring a prosecution?

615
00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.611
"He's gonna do this to somebody else."

616
00:38:43.195 --> 00:38:45.489
"No." They were adamant.

617
00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.074
I was fuming.

618
00:38:49.452 --> 00:38:51.579
I didn't say very much to him other than.

619
00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:54.540
"You have no idea.
Dennis. how lucky you are."

620
00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:56.709
Because he would have gone to prison.

621
00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.962
Grievous bodily harm with intent.

622
00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:02.214
potentially life imprisonment.

623
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:06.635
When you dealt with somebody.

624
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:10.389
it was incumbent upon you
to type out an intelligence card.

625
00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:14.060
And at the top of the card. I typed.

626
00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:17.438
"In my opinion.
this man is a dangerous psychopath."

627
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.196
I always think about
what if they had said.

628
00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:26.614
"We'll prosecute him"?

629
00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:29.200
Who would still be breathing today?

630
00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.286
But there was a shame factor.

631
00:39:32.953 --> 00:39:34.080
They would be shamed.

632
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:39.085
Um. and. "We want to take him home
and. you know. forget all about it."

633
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.673
He must have thought
he was the luckiest person in the world.

634
00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:49.011
And he would never forget that.

635
00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:01.482
[McCusker] The West End was a vibe.

636
00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:05.111
Plenty of action. lots of people.

637
00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:07.113
a way to get lost.

638
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.785
It was just teeming
with millionaires to paupers.

639
00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:20.292
But one of the officers on my team
came back to me. and he said.

640
00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:23.254
"I've been to the pub
and spoken to some people there."

641
00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:27.883
And they had described a guy called John.
and he was known as John the Guardsman.

642
00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:34.515
Nilsen had already told us
about a guy called John

643
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:39.228
who wore a woolly hat
that looked like a Guardsman's hat.

644
00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:50.364
But we found out that John the Guardsman
was known in that area

645
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.491
as a rent boy.

646
00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:02.209
It's the first time
that I had heard the term "rent boy."

647
00:41:06.922 --> 00:41:09.758
[Nilsen] Night bringeth the wild dance.

648
00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:13.596
It is the prenuptials before the feast

649
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:15.848
where all appetites are sated.

650
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:19.935
Helter-skelter into the fray of the dance.

651
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:23.105
satisfying these appetites.

652
00:41:29.778 --> 00:41:31.614
[Bence] It was a playground. wasn't it?

653
00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:35.409
And Nilsen could get whatever he wanted.

654
00:41:36.535 --> 00:41:38.245
It was just a flesh market.

655
00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:43.792
[McCusker] We went
to West End Central Police Station.

656
00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:46.253
And they had an index
of all the rent boys.

657
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.588
and there was hundreds.

658
00:41:50.799 --> 00:41:53.344
We were able to identify
John the Guardsman

659
00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:55.930
as a man called John Howlett.

660
00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:59.141
and I spoke to his mother.

661
00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.685
Howlett had left home of his own accord.

662
00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:03.395
He'd got involved in drugs.

663
00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:07.775
and there was quite simply an acceptance
that her son had died.

664
00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:15.449
Nilsen obviously knew that
if these young rent boys went missing.

665
00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:20.496
usually. they just vanished
into the London ether.

666
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:39.640
[Hunt] It got easier.
digging that little garden.

667
00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:43.143
but it became evident
that he wasn't lying.

668
00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:48.023
We're finding dozens. and dozens.
and dozens of tiny bones.

669
00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:56.574
But nothing was so intact
that we could identify people from it.

670
00:42:57.992 --> 00:42:59.201
And then I started thinking

671
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:02.329
perhaps we weren't ever gonna find out
who these people were.

672
00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:06.458
And you think.
"How on earth have you got to this place?"

673
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:08.836
"What journey did you go on

674
00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:11.380
to end up here?"

675
00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:16.969
[man] The police contacted me.

676
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:21.682
They'd found
my National Insurance card in Des's flat.

677
00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:25.269
I expect the police
did have suspicions about me at first

678
00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:27.521
as to who I was. and why wasn't…

679
00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.399
why wasn't I done away with?

680
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.914
It was a warm night.

681
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:51.503
I was playing a fruit machine.

682
00:43:52.713 --> 00:43:55.424
and a guy behind me was watching me.

683
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:59.094
I could see him
from the reflection in the machine.

684
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:01.430
He said. "You won't win much on that one."

685
00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:04.308
I said. "Oh. now you tell me."

686
00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:07.061
And he said. "I think it's just paid out."

687
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:10.648
And he said. um.
"Do you want to come home?"

688
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:15.527
We went back to Melrose Avenue.

689

[classical music playing]

690
00:44:16.945 --> 00:44:19.323
[Martyn] And he put on classical music.

691
00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:24.703
[Nilsen] Who is this man?

692
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:30.709
A unit in the herd.

693
00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.672
A ghost in society.

694
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:38.300
How is he formed?

695
00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:42.680
Who and what has placed him
towards this fate?

696
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:46.725
He asked me where I came from.
He asked me about my family.

697
00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:48.644
So he seemed quite caring.

698
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.813
and that impressed me.

699
00:44:50.896 --> 00:44:54.066
And I thought. "Ah! Okay. I like you."

700
00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:56.777
But I never said it.
But I thought. "I like this guy."

701
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.362
[classical music continues]

702
00:45:02.157 --> 00:45:05.744
[Martyn] I told him
that I was from Exeter. outside London.

703
00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:10.749
When I was younger.
a few people knew that I was gay.

704
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.877
but it was just. "He'll grow out of it."

705
00:45:15.587 --> 00:45:18.173
All the kids seemed to think
I was a bit of a joke.

706
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.261
So I would go to my bedroom.

707
00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.805
I just wanted to be in the darkness.

708
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.688
I was 14 when I ran away.

709
00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:37.901
Think I had not much more than about £10
or something like that.

710
00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:41.280
but it was enough to get me to London.

711
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.871
I remember thinking. "So this is London."

712
00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:54.042
"I'm in London!
Nobody knows who I am now."

713
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:55.627
"I can get lost up here."

714
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.882
But I had no way of living.
I didn't know what to do.

715
00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:01.091
And I was freezing.

716
00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:07.139
So I found somewhere to sleep
in a car park behind Piccadilly Circus.

717
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:12.186
But then I could see
these other boys just hanging around.

718
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.937
"I wonder what that's about?"

719
00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:16.023
I see money changing hands.

720
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.859
I see men kissing boys.

721
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.196
But then some old man was passing by.

722
00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.656
and he explained we were on the meat rack.

723
00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:28.911
where each lamppost
was owned by a rent boy.

724
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.914
And they all had nicknames.

725
00:46:31.997 --> 00:46:35.209
You wouldn't call somebody
by their proper name. That's for sure.

726
00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.293
And they weren't all gay.

727
00:46:36.376 --> 00:46:38.295
They were just doing it
because they needed money.

728
00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:44.259
Some of the customers
were not very pleasant sometimes.

729
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.888
But you'd do it
because you need to survive.

730
00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:53.894
But Des was quite friendly.
very friendly. in fact.

731
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.647
And you ain't seen nothing yet.

732
00:46:57.272 --> 00:47:01.109
The other week.
we got this TV here. 360 quid.

733
00:47:01.193 --> 00:47:03.695
Stereo set. about 200 quid.

734
00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:08.450
And budgerigar up here. Hamish.
Have a look at Hamish. Priceless.

735
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.703
He even showed me the gardens.

736
00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:22.756
When we came here. this back garden
was like a bloody rubbish heap with…

737
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.301
There was tons of old cookers.
and tires. and debris.

738
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:28.929
and plaster. and wood.
and God knows what else.

739
00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.889
It was completely overgrown with rubbish.

740
00:47:30.973 --> 00:47:34.518
And we. the good old tenant.
trying to improve the property.

managed to make it what it is now.

742
00:47:37.437 --> 00:47:40.148
Look at it. It's quite neat and tidy.
There's a little fence there.

743
00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:42.359
There's vegetables in abundance growing.

744
00:47:42.442 --> 00:47:43.735
And what else can I say?

745
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:46.780
But then he had Bacardi in a bottle.

746
00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:49.324
and he drank that as we were speaking.

747
00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:50.993
Uh. and then.

748
00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:53.495
we went to bed.

749
00:47:58.292 --> 00:48:00.002
[Nilsen] As is my desire.

750
00:48:00.085 --> 00:48:03.297
the most beautiful creature in my universe

751
00:48:03.797 --> 00:48:08.135
is sleek. slim. male youth.

752
00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:12.264
The sight of him. in his adamant glory.

753
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:17.853
sends my mind
into a concentration of cathartic spasms.

754
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.647
The man obsessed.

755
00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:22.774
The drive powerful.

756
00:48:24.192 --> 00:48:26.320
The heart a-pounding!

757
00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:30.490
He is oblivious to the future.

758
00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:34.536
[Martyn] It must have been
about two hours later.

759
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.706
I opened my eyes.
and there was smoke in front of me.

760
00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:40.167
and he was straddled across me.

761
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:43.378
And just pushing him backwards.

762
00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:46.006
I said.
"What's happening? What's happened?"

763
00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:48.800
And he said.
"You knocked the fire off the wall."

764
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.431
I got water. poured it over the floor.

765
00:48:54.514 --> 00:48:56.975
and I left.
'cause I was really quite upset.

766
00:48:57.059 --> 00:48:59.895
because I thought.
"I've caused that damage to his flat."

767
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:03.982
But it didn't make sense.

768
00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:07.152
The fire wouldn't have been on
because it was a warm night.

769
00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:11.865
Then I realized
he was trying to kill me that night.

770
00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:26.296
But I didn't know who to talk to.
I didn't know where to turn.

771
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.051

was extremely homophobic.

772
00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.636

The press certainly were.

774
00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:38.058
So I stayed quiet. in a room.

when I was younger. in the dark.

It wasn't as if.
after three or four hours.

"Oh. I found one."

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.374

to that kind of stuff.

Police have half a dozen names

may have been victims.

you know. had been breaking and…

I don't know. I…
Of course I was interested.

805

I mean. who wasn't?

806
00:51:43.892 --> 00:51:46.645
It was horrific. and I thought.
"God. them poor parents."

And that was it.

808
00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:53.860
But then there was a knock on the door.

809
00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.404
and this police officer said.
"Can we come in?"

810
00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:58.490
I said. "What's it about?"
He said. "Can we come in?"

811
00:51:58.573 --> 00:52:00.909
"I think you better sit down."
I thought. "Oh God."

812
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:02.828
Still never entered my head.

813
00:52:03.578 --> 00:52:06.123
And when we got indoors.
he showed me this photo.

814
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:07.999
He said. "Do you know this person?"

815
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:11.628
I said. "Yeah. of course I know him."

816

It was Graham. the love of my life.

817
00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:18.885
And then he said.
"Have you heard of a man called Nilsen?"

818
00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.805
Even then.
I didn't put two and two together

819
00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:26.351
because they said that Nilsen
was only picking on homeless homosexuals.

820
00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:32.065
So that put my mind
a bit at rest that he was…

821
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.568
It couldn't be him. He's not homosexual.

822
00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:39.990
And then they asked me. "Had he had
any dental treatment just lately?"

823
00:52:40.073 --> 00:52:42.951
I was thinking.
"Why do you keep asking me these things

824
00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:45.871
about dental records.
and teeth. and jaws?"

825

00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:58.526

852
00:54:00.195 --> 00:54:01.029
Yeah.

[ominous music playing]

854
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.704
[Shane] I was coming home
from the little sweet shop at the top.

855
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.958
and as I got down the road.
I could hear screaming.

856
00:54:14.542 --> 00:54:17.629
And for some reason.
I knew that was my mother's voice

857
00:54:17.712 --> 00:54:19.381
and that was my mother's pain.

858
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:24.261
and when we got in there.
my mother was in the kitchen crying.

859
00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:29.557
My father had been murdered
at the hands of Dennis Nilsen.

860
00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:33.311
[Lesley] The reporters were barbaric.

861
00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:35.897
You know. they say.
"They're all homeless. all homosexuals."

862
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:38.024
They weren't. you know?

863
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:41.653
Don't clump 'em all in one box.
They were all individuals.

864
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:44.406
I phoned up newspapers
and blew my top at 'em.

865
00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:48.952
And then
we had the press round at the door.

866
00:54:49.035 --> 00:54:50.161
God. it was awful.

867
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:54.582
And one of the reporters asked me.
did I know all the facts?

868
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:57.252
I said. "I know as much
as the police have told me."

869
00:54:58.086 --> 00:55:00.297
He said. "They haven't told you
what happened afterwards?"

870
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.381
I said. "No. Why?"

871
00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:02.549
He said. uh.

872
00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:06.094
"It's not very nice.
Do you want me to tell you?"

873
00:55:06.177 --> 00:55:07.470
I said. "Yes."

874
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:14.769
It was just some compulsion.
that I had to know.

875
00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:19.607
Nilsen was down the West End.

876
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:25.196
And he saw Graham trying to get a cab.

877
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.115
but no cabs would stop for him

878
00:55:27.198 --> 00:55:29.034
because he was staggering
all over the place.

879
00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.954
And Nilsen took him back to his place.

880
00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.041
where he went behind him…

881
00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:40.879
and strangled him.

882
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:46.551
That was his words.

883
00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:53.433
And then he sat him in an armchair
for two days while he went to work.

884
00:55:53.975 --> 00:55:57.187
He came back
and sat next to him on the settee.

885
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.938
and they watched TV together.

886
00:56:00.565 --> 00:56:03.234
On the third night. he stripped him naked.

887
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.780
stood him up in front
of. like. a dressing table mirror.

888
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.573
and held him from behind.

889
00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:12.869
covered him in talcum powder.
and then masturbated over him.

890
00:56:17.248 --> 00:56:18.750
I just wanted to pretend

891
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:20.877
it didn't happen.

892
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.546
He overdosed.
and he was dead somewhere. No! No!

893

But you can't turn your mind off.

Yes.

902
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:55.286
I think it was yesterday
I received a letter

903
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.747
from a reporter fishing for a story.

904
00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:00.834
"I realize
you're producing an autobiography…"

906
00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:04.087
"What are you saying in it?"

907
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:05.255
Yak. yak. yak.

908
00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:15.348
[man] I was a young
wannabe investigative journalist.

909
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.559
I was completely green behind the ears.

910
00:57:18.476 --> 00:57:20.895
And one morning I read in the paper

911
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.482
that there was this serial killer.

912
00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:26.901
killed 15 people.

913
00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:31.656
who was now writing
his own autobiography in prison.

914
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.325
and I was intrigued.

915
00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:37.203
So then I started writing to Nilsen.

916
00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.330
saying. "Dear Mr. Nilsen.

917
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:45.170
I believe your book will become
a landmark work of criminology.

918
00:57:45.253 --> 00:57:46.546
and I'd like to cover it

919
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:50.049
for a serious
British broadsheet newspaper."

920
00:57:52.343 --> 00:57:55.096
After a week. this letter arrived.

921
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:59.017
The first thing I noticed was

922
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:03.229
the Biro was pressed really hard
against the paper.

923
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:06.691
uh. like a man bursting to tell his story.

924
00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:09.777
"Dear Russ. thank you for your letter."

00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:12.739
"You're keen to know
how I justify the publication of my book?"

926
00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.783
"Well. my first instinct
is to quote dear old Oscar."

927
00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:18.703
"'There is no such thing
as a moral or amoral book.'"

928
00:58:18.786 --> 00:58:20.955
"'It's either well written
or badly written.'"

When I first got

"You're just not gonna believe

was to do with his grandfather.

is too great for this short narrative.

and then. of course. the religious people.
they never say they're dead.

They just said.
"Oh. he's gone to a better place."

954
00:59:56.175 --> 00:59:58.678
He says.
"He always took me everywhere with him."

00:59:59.178 --> 01:00:02.140
"Why could he not have taken me
to that better place with him?"

when he saw his grandfather's body.

turning point in his life

1000
01:03:20.004 --> 01:03:22.298
was when he became a cook in the army.

1001
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.970
And that was when Nilsen.
for the first time. had his own room.

And he would strip himself naked
and put talcum powder over his body.

1003

as if he was seeing a dead body.

Some of them were gay but not all of them.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.551
no one would notice anytime soon.

1021
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.138
All the victims were young men.

1022
01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.308
Martyn Duffey from the Wirral.

1023
01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.144
Malcolm Barlow from Rotherham.

1024
01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:02.565
Kenneth Ockenden.
a 26-year-old Canadian student

1025
01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:05.318
who was visiting this country
three years ago.

1026
01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:07.737
And William Sutherland of Edinburgh…

1027
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.198
I just can't get over it.

1028
01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:15.411
[interviewer]
Would you have any kind of warning

1029
01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:18.247
for the parents of youngsters

1030
01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:21.292
who were thinking in terms
of going down to London?

1031
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.336
Never to go. [sniffles]

1032
01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:27.965
It's such a cruel.
horrible place. [sniffs]

1033
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.970
[Lesley] The police told me
the trial was beginning. and they said.

1034
01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:36.307
"Listen.
we've just come to advise you not to go

1035
01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:40.561
because they will be talking about Graham.
and they will have some of the…

1036
01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:44.190
more or less.
tools of the trade that he used there."

1037
01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.942
And I thought. "No. I'm going."

1038
01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:49.403
I just had that compulsion.
that feeling that I had to go.

1039
01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:53.366
In a way. it was me…
in my frame of mind. really.

1040
01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:56.744
that I was paying
my last respects to Graham.

1041
01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.581
Sort of. you know.

1042
01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.876
saying goodbye to him. really.

1043
01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:06.712
You know. and I didn't want…

1044
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.256
I didn't want them talking about him.

1045
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:13.344
and. uh. you know.
he didn't have anyone there for him.

1046
01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:15.972
so I just felt that need that I-- [sniffs]

1047
01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:17.181
That I had to go.

1048
01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:18.599
and that's what I did.

1049
01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.644
[tense music playing]

1050
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:26.065
[Nilsen] Morning of Monday. 24th October.

1051
01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.942
I'm inside a security van

1052
01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:31.988
en route to No. 1 Court
of Central Criminal Court. the Old Bailey.

1053
01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:34.740
It is now.

1054
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.077
today. the reckoning.

1055
01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:44.333
[Bence] The Central Criminal Court

1056
01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.586
is. without question.
the most famous court in the world.

1057
01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.463
It is a theater.

1058
01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.677
[Nilsen] It is a theater of the absurd.

1059
01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.346
Parts have been written.

1060
01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:02.393
The actors clear their throats
for their oratorical delivery.

1061
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.813
I can remember
the first time he walked up the steps

1062
01:07:05.896 --> 01:07:07.690
in No. 1 Court. the Old Bailey…

1063
01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:11.235
…and stood. um. all the eyes are on him.

1064
01:07:11.318 --> 01:07:14.822
We all had expected
that he would plead guilty.

1065
01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:21.454
[Nilsen] I can imagine a Panavision camera

1066
01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:25.499
on a crane. idling round the court.

1067
01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.712
[Bence] If there's a guilty plea.
there'd have been no trial.

1068
01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.839
but the journalists
would be very disappointed

1069
01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:33.090
because there's no story.

1070
01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.301
That's it. Story over.

1071
01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:41.891
At the Old Bailey. civil servant
Dennis Nilsen has pleaded not guilty.

1072
01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:47.521
I couldn't believe it.
He never flinched. Nothing.

1073
01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:50.608
I'm thinking.
"Are you human. actually? Are you?"

1074
01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:53.152
[Nilsen] Silence in court!

1075
01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:59.742
[whispering] Silence. silence.
silence. silence. silence.

1076
01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:01.243
[playing "Für Elise"]

1077
01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.462
[producer] Had you ever defended
a serial killer before?

1078
01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:13.380
No.

1079
01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:15.466
Nor since.

1080
01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.929
I mean. if you rule out the Krays.

1081
01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.181
["Für Elise" continues]

1082
01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:26.852
[Lawrence] Looking at it
from an ordinary person's point of view.

1083
01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:29.355
all this behavior was madness.

1084
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.441
It didn't seem to us to be arguable

1085
01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:35.027
that the fellow wasn't deranged.

1086
01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.906
But the whole thing for me.

1087
01:08:38.989 --> 01:08:44.120
was he too mad to be sentenced
to life imprisonment for murder?

1088
01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:49.458
It has been said
that if he behaved normally…

1089
01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:54.338
He was. after all. a civil servant
working in the labor exchange.

1090
01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:55.965
and he'd been a policeman.

1091
01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:59.218
So if he was capable of rational behavior.

1092
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.303
then he can't be mad.

1093
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.808
Ah. but. you see. the law says

1094
01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:10.604
that you can be behaving
perfectly normally for a lot of the time.

1095
01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:16.235
and then on this particular incident
when you kill somebody. you were deranged.

1096
01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:19.321
and then you went back to being normal.

1097
01:09:20.197 --> 01:09:22.700
Then you're guilty
of diminished responsibility

1098
01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:25.327
and. therefore. of manslaughter.

1099
01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:30.332
I don't want him to be mad.
I want him to pay.

1100
01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:31.917
Let him pay.

1101
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.545
Make him responsible for what he's done.

1102
01:09:36.088 --> 01:09:38.257
"He's not insane."
insisted the prosecution.

1103
01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.050
"nor is he mentally ill."

1104
01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.969
"He has an abnormal mind."

1105
01:09:42.052 --> 01:09:46.640
"But his responsibility for his acts
was not substantially impaired."

1106
01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:50.102
"He knew what he was doing."
Nilsen is alleged to have told the police.

1107
01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:52.438
"I've taken a lot of people
back to my flat.

1108
01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:54.023
and I haven't killed them all."

1109
01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.193
We needed to prove
that he had premeditation

1110
01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:00.571
and had intent to go down
to the West End to pick these victims up.

1111
01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:02.948
which put us in a little bit of a panic.

1112
01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.451
We trawled. obviously. looking for anybody

1113
01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.120
who'd met him in a bar
that he'd just had a drink with.

1114
01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.040
"Have you met this guy?
Did you go to his house?"

1115
01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.042
But back in 1983?

1116
01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.336
Ah! Brick wall.

1117
01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:21.342
[Martyn] I didn't really want
to be standing in that theater.

1118
01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:24.511
'Cause that's what it was to me.
The whole world would be watching that.

1119
01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:27.806
I didn't want
everybody to know that I was gay.

1120
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.141
I didn't want that.

1121
01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:31.769
Why should I have to go through that

1122
01:10:31.852 --> 01:10:34.563
because of what somebody else has done?
Why should we?

1123
01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.191
I was warned by people beforehand

1124
01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:41.612
whoever solicitor was against you
would tear you apart and expose your life.

1125
01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:44.990
So I didn't want to be involved
any more than what I was.

1126
01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:49.703
[Hunt] When we eventually found
some of these men.

1127
01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.248
they were afraid
people would think they were gay.

1128
01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.875
And that was a problem with the press

1129
01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.670
homing in
on this one aspect of this investigation.

1130
01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:00.130
[recorder clicks]

1131
01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:04.635
[Nilsen] My mind now turns to one night.

1132
01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:09.890
I met a wandering spirit like me.

1133
01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:15.229
Nilsen had talked
about a young man called Carl Stottor.

1134
01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:17.231
who'd actually survived him.

1135
01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:23.779
[Coffey] I'd seen the name Carl Stottor
appear in the autobiography.

1136
01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.615
so I felt that it was very important

1137
01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:30.035
that I get to know one
of Nilsen's survivors' side of the story.

1138
01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:36.166
We arranged for me to come down
and meet him in his flat near the sea.

1139
01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.503
[Coffey on recording]
I'm trying to put you

1140
01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:41.463
into the context of the Nilsen story.

1141
01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:42.881
[Stottor on recording] Mmm.

1142
01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:46.552
[Coffey] How much can you recollect
of the night prior to the incident?

1143
01:11:48.595 --> 01:11:50.097
[Stottor] I was on my own.

1144
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.515
It was a gay pub.

1145
01:11:51.598 --> 01:11:55.686
and he came over
and asked me if I minded if he joined me.

1146
01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:59.481
You know.
I found him quite comfortable to talk to.

1147
01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.693
and we hailed a cab
and went to Cranley Gardens.

1148
01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:10.075
We were just chatting.
And he poured a drink. which was Bacardi.

1149
01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.619
and. um. we ended up going to bed.

1150
01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.623
[water running]

1151
01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.711
[Stottor] But before we got into bed.
he said. "Oh. be careful.

1152
01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:23.589
because you might get caught
in the sleeping bag zip."

1153
01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.758
-The zip had broken away.
-[Coffey] Yeah.

1154
01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:30.471
[Stottor] But I felt tired.
so we cuddled up. and I fell asleep.

1155
01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:36.185
And all of a sudden. I felt cold.

1156
01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.521
[water running]

1157
01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:42.566
[Stottor] And then I realized
I was in a bath of cold water.

1158
01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.788
I tried to get out.
and he pushed me back down.

1159
01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:59.416
And three times I came up.
and I managed to say.

1160
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.543
"Stop! Please. no more!"

1161
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:07.174
And I remember just lying there.
I couldn't fight anymore.

1162
01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:10.594
I remember just breathing in the water.

1163
01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:15.641
It was like breathing solid air.

1164
01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:21.480
I remembered thinking. "You're dying."

1165
01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.108
"And this is what it feels like."

1166
01:13:25.275 --> 01:13:26.485
And a light…

1167
01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:34.618
[Nilsen] We are moral creatures
of drives and conscience.

1168
01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:38.497
I am both strong and weak.

1169
01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:42.000
angelic and demonic.

1170
01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:46.922
both the cool hand
to soothe the fevered forehead

1171
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:51.260
and the desperate. raging hand
at the throat.

1172
01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:56.515
The harbinger of both life and death.

1173
01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.944
[Stottor] I remember
coming round and the pain.

1174
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.906
I could hardly breathe. It was awful.

1175
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.951
But I was confused.
You know. I couldn't remember anything.

1176
01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.246
But I knew somebody had tried to kill me.

1177
01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:21.915
So I went to the police.

1178
01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:26.879
They didn't believe me.
They didn't take any notice.

1179
01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:31.216
I was just a silly little poofter.
a drama queen.

1180
01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.140
[Bence] Carl Stottor went to the police.
but nothing was done.

1181
01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:40.851
Then we found out
there was a string of about five of them.

1182
01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:43.353
They went to the police.
and lodged complaints.

1183
01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:44.688
or tried to lodge complaints.

1184
01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:47.232
and were treated
fairly disdainfully. really.

1185
01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.775
So no action was taken.

1186
01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:53.697
[Stottor] I thought.
"Maybe they're right."

1187
01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.074
"They know what they're doing.
They know their job."

1188
01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:58.285
"It was me."

1189
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:00.579
"I imagined it."

1190
01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:07.878
[Coffey] Nilsen gave them information
that led to them finding you.

1191
01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:08.962
[Stottor] Hmm.

1192
01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.636
[Stottor] The detective
that interviewed me said.

1193
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:19.848
"We just wanna ask you a few questions.
Do you know anyone called Dennis Nilsen?"

1194
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:20.933
I went. "No."

1195
01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.937
He said.
"You ever been to Cranley Gardens?"

1196
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.605
I went. "Where's that?"

1197
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.484
And he went.
"Okay then. just one more question."

1198
01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:32.569
and said. "Sleeping bag."

1199
01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.072
and I started shaking.

1200
01:15:37.407 --> 01:15:38.784
And it all came back.

1201
01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:40.827
everything

1202
01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.205
in detail.

1203
01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:45.791
It was Nilsen.

1204
01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.670
He used the sleeping bag zip
to strangle me.

1205
01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:50.587
[Coffey] Right.

1206
01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:53.382
[Stottor] But before we got into bed.
he said. "Oh. be careful.

1207
01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:56.343
because you might get caught up
in the sleeping bag zip."

1208
01:15:56.426 --> 01:16:00.264
But by prewarning me.
he was already premeditating my death.

1209
01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:03.100
If he hadn't succeeded.
then he had an alibi.

1210
01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:06.353
He knew what he was doing.
There wasn't anything psychotic about him.

1211
01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.564
He was totally in control.

1212
01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:12.651
The simple reason why I'm alive

1213
01:16:13.193 --> 01:16:16.905
is because Nilsen had no more room
under the floorboards to house my body.

1214
01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:23.870
[McCusker] Carl Stottor's story proved
that Nilsen had premeditation.

1215
01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:27.165
But most of these victims
would tell you things.

1216
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:30.168
but in no circumstances
would they ever want to be a witness.

1217
01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:34.840
[Hunt] It would have been
absolutely horrendous

1218
01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.384
for these young men to come forward.

1219
01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.847
They would have been vilified.

1220
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:44.141
I've been in court hundreds of times

1221
01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:47.853
and seen victims.
witnesses torn to shreds.

1222
01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:51.398
So people are not gonna put themselves
in that position.

1223
01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.319
[Stottor] I hated
the way the press claimed

1224
01:16:55.402 --> 01:17:01.867
that all of Nilsen's victims were waifs.
and strays. and pathetic homosexuals.

1225
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.160
It was awful.

1226
01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:07.873
I remember thinking. "No. I have worth."

1227
01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:11.710
And. in one respect.
I have to thank Nilsen for that.

1228
01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:14.588
because had I not died
and had that near-death experience.

1229
01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:15.839
I would never have known.

1230
01:17:16.673 --> 01:17:19.384
There's nothing to fear but fear itself.

1231
01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:22.679
Remove the fear.
and there's nothing left to fear anymore.

1232
01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.600
[reporter 1] On the second day
of the Dennis Nilsen trial.

1233
01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:29.519
the prosecution
has continued outlining its case.

1234
01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.693
[reporter 2] Carl Stottor told
of going to bed with Nilsen

1235
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.320
and waking in the middle of the night

1236
01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:41.448
unable to breathe.
feeling pressure around his neck.

1237
01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:47.037
In a tiny. quiet voice. he told the court
he heard Nilsen whispering. "Keep still."

1238
01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:50.415
[Hunt] I have absolutely nothing
but admiration

1239
01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:53.835
for their courage
and strength of character

1240
01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:54.920
to come forward.

1241
01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.215
Well. the…
the thought that went through my mind was.

1242
01:17:58.715 --> 01:18:01.510
"You are drowning.
You are being murdered by this man.

1243
01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:04.262
and this is what it feels like.
and you're going to die."

1244
01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:08.475
[reporter 3] At the Old Bailey. a number
of former partners of Dennis Nilsen

1245
01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:12.062
have been speaking of Nilsen's
alleged attempts to murder them.

1246
01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:19.277
[Martyn] I remember thinking to myself.
"You have to get through this."

1247
01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.612
"Just survive it."

1248
01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:22.781
I thought to myself.

1249
01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:26.284
"Let's do it. I can face it.
Whatever life throws at me. bring it on."

1250
01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:31.289
So I did attend the trial.

1251
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.669
I fell asleep.
and about half past three in the morning.

1252
01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.672
I woke up. and he was right beside me.

1253
01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.549
I looked at him and said.
"What are you doing?"

1254
01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:42.718
And he said. "You knocked the fire over."

1255
01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:47.139
So I found that kind of freedom.
I can express myself a bit more.

1256
01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.307
I don't have to hide
what I feel all the time.

1257
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.602
It's lovely.

1258
01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:56.773
First. though. at the Old Bailey.
the jury has now retired

1259
01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.317
to consider its verdict
in the case of Dennis Nilsen.

1260
01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:02.279
And indeed. if we hear
any more news from the Nilsen trial.

1261
01:19:02.362 --> 01:19:05.490
we'll bring it to you as soon as possible
later in the program.

1262
01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:08.660
[Nilsen] How can you express
the contents of a trial?

1263
01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:14.541
Ten days of chatter posing
as ten days of relevant evidence.

1264
01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.919
[reporter 4] When they returned to court.
they'd reached a verdict

1265
01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.589
on all counts of murder
and two of attempted murder.

1266
01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:26.094
Ten jurors had agreed. Two had dissented.
The foreman of the jury answered

1267
01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:30.432
that they'd reached majority verdicts
of guilty on all six murder charges.

1268
01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:33.351
[reporters clamoring]

1269
01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:36.855
[reporter 4] The jury has. in effect.

1270
01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:39.775
found him to be fully responsible
for his actions.

1271
01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:41.610
not out of his mind.

1272
01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:45.405
[Coffey] Everybody
who's involved in the Nilsen story

1273
01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:47.282
eventually comes to a point

1274
01:19:47.365 --> 01:19:50.911
where they decide
that Nilsen was bad and… and not mad.

1275
01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:55.040
You just have to know him for long enough.

1276
01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.793
It's like the Wizard of Oz
behind the curtain.

1277
01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:02.214
You're left
with this little piece of dirt.

1278
01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:09.679
Nilsen could paint such a vivid picture
of a romantic outsider character

1279
01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:15.811
that made it hard to believe
that he killed out of pure evil.

1280
01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:23.068
He needed to see himself in a certain way.

1281
01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.947
And the grandfather story. it's possible.

1282
01:20:27.447 --> 01:20:29.491
but there's no evidence for it.

1283
01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:31.576
So I cannot help but feel

1284
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.788
that it's simply Nilsen trying
to find another villain…

1285
01:20:34.871 --> 01:20:38.083
[chuckles] …other than himself.
to point the blame elsewhere.

1286
01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:42.212
[Nilsen] At teatime today.

1287
01:20:42.295 --> 01:20:46.842
I was given this categorization review.
Category A.

1288
01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:51.263
"Your custodial behavior is satisfactory."

1289
01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:57.102
"Reports. however. describe you
as a cold and calculating individual.

1290
01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:02.941
who has shown little inclination
to confront your offending behavior."

1291
01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:05.569
"There are no recommendations
for downgrading

1292
01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:08.738
due to the absence of any real remorse."

1293
01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:10.699
Well!

1294
01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:16.997
So I took it upon myself
to provide a very short comment.

1295
01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:20.834
"This report
is just the sort of politically correct.

1296
01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.919
prejudiced hatchet job

1297
01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:29.009
which one can expect from petty officials
anxious to embroider the monster myth

1298
01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:30.510
than make any objective--"

1299
01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:31.469
[recorder clicks]

1300
01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:38.018
[Coffey] Society didn't create Nilsen.
That's what he'd like you to believe.

1301
01:21:41.938 --> 01:21:46.943
But we've still got to take responsibility
for creating the prejudiced society

1302
01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:49.988
that enabled him
to kill over and over again.

1303
01:21:52.782 --> 01:21:53.867
[Bence] It was easy.

1304
01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:57.829
He just knew from his experiences
and the circumstances.

1305
01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:00.332
nobody really cared.

1306
01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.045
[Hunt] I swear to you. in Cranley Gardens.

1307
01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:08.173
if the bodies
had not got stuck in the drain

1308
01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:11.426
and affected the people
who lived below him.

1309
01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:13.470
he'd have killed for another few years.

1310
01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.139
The only reason he was stopped

1311
01:22:16.222 --> 01:22:20.852
is because his activities
imposed on somebody else.

1312
01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.605
Nothing to do with the victims.

1313
01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.299
[ominous music playing]

1314
01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.183
My Shane came in and told me.

1315
01:23:00.266 --> 01:23:02.560
I was in bed.
He come in and said. "Nilsen's dead."

1316
01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.522
And I said. "Don't lie."
He said. "I'm telling you. He's dead."

1317
01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:13.530
And I never mentioned it again because…

1318
01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:16.950
it just didn't mean anything to me.

1319
01:23:20.453 --> 01:23:22.539
And the newspapers again. you know.

1320
01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:24.708
"What do you think
now the monster's dead?"

1321
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:27.377
I said. "I don't think anything.
I don't think about him."

1322
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.547
"Even when he's dead.
I'm not letting him make me a victim."

1323
01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.258
You know?

1324
01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.802
But I just hope wherever he goes.
he don't meet Graham.

1325
01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:37.929
'cause Graham would be sober. [laughs]
