3
00:01:54.949 --> 00:02:01.037
Despite possible coincidences.
this film is fictional.

4
00:02:04.737 --> 00:02:08.346
Rio de Janeiro present time

5
00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:39.959
We'll wait behind the hospital.

6
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.793
Tell us when he comes out. okay?

7
00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:49.968
He's going to the parking lot.

8
00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:52.721
Attention. He's coming out.

9
00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:42.767
This may look like an
American movie cliche

10
00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:45.853
but it's when facing death
that we understand life.

11
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.397
I beat up a lot of junkies.

12
00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.316
I took down many crooked cops.

13
00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:52.318
I sent a ton of
thugs into a ditch.

14
00:03:53.403 --> 00:03:55.236
But it was nothing personal.

15
00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:57.781
Society prepared me for this.

16
00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:00.825
And a mission assigned. my friend.
is a mission accomplished.

17
00:04:04.192 --> 00:04:09.679
ELITE SQUAD 2:
THE ENEMY WITHIN

18
00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:39.696
Special Ops. (BOPE)

19
00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:40.862
You'll never be one of us!

20
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:52.708
Talk. talk! Who's the killer?
Tell me!

21
00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:09.139
- Tell me you want out!
- No. sir!

22
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.390
If not. you're out!

23
00:05:13.687 --> 00:05:15.437
...that I'm about to have a son.

24
00:05:31.704 --> 00:05:32.995
She has two kids!

25
00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:44.756
I tried to save my family...

26
00:05:44.758 --> 00:05:46.424
I left a guy I trusted
in my place.

27
00:05:46.968 --> 00:05:48.760
Didn't work out.
and I came back.

28
00:05:49.304 --> 00:05:51.304
I was with BOPE many years.

29
00:05:51.764 --> 00:05:53.972
I commanded the unit.
Fought until the end.

30
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:57.309
I'd still be with BOPE.
if not for what happened...

31
00:05:57.311 --> 00:05:59.895
at the Penitentiary Laercio
da Costa Pellegrino...

32
00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:02.355
better known as "Bangu One".

33
00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.233
(Bangu One. 4 years earlier)

34
00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:06.359
- Big Curio.
- Hey! How you doing?

35
00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:10.196
- All good?
- Quiet.

36
00:06:10.198 --> 00:06:11.363
Enough work there?

37
00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:17.203
This is where the drug lords
ended up...

38
00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:18.329
Hey. partner.

39
00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:20.831
...the guys that the police
caught and didn't execute...

40
00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.792
because they had a lot
dough to lose.

41
00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:24.375
- All good here?
- All good.

42
00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:29.339
Each drug gang was put
in its own isolated wing.

43
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.176
If left to mix.
these punks would kill each other.

44
00:06:41.644 --> 00:06:43.393
You know what they did inside?

45
00:06:43.687 --> 00:06:45.395
The same as outside.

46
00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:49.691
They were at war. vying for
control of trafficking in the city.

47
00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:07.667
If up to me. I'd lock them up.
throw away the key...

48
00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:09.876
and let them slaughter
each other inside.

49
00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:13.255
But there are liberal
intellectuals...

50
00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:15.257
who make a living
defending these punks.

51
00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:19.052
What's worse is that they get
into the heads of many people.

52
00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:22.848
...the craziest thing we've been
discussing is that prison today...

53
00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.723
is a place that costs enormously...

54
00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:28.435
only to make people worse.

55
00:07:29.063 --> 00:07:30.855
And look what more and more...

56
00:07:30.857 --> 00:07:32.731
Fraga lived to call me
a fascist

57
00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:34.984
but didn't have the courage
to tell it to my face.

58
00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:38.070
When we spoke face to face.
he pretended to respect me.

59
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:41.322
And the fucked-up thing is
I had to do the same.

60
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.742
...Just to give you an idea.
in 1996...

61
00:07:44.744 --> 00:07:49.038
the Brazilian prison population
was 148.000 prisoners.

62
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.709
Today. 10 years later.
the prison population...

63
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.711
is over 400.000 prisoners.

64
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.131
It's more than double.
It's almost triple.

65
00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:04.011
I made a calculation.
It's perverse. I have it here.

66
00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:06.054
Obviously. doesn't make sense.

67
00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:08.931
Picture this. a history professor
doing math. What a disaster.

68
00:08:09.434 --> 00:08:12.852
But this one I must make sure
to share with you...

69
00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:15.062
which is that I noticed...

70
00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:18.149
that the Brazilian
prison population...

71
00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:21.736
doubles. on average.
every 8 years.

72
00:08:21.904 --> 00:08:25.655
While the Brazilian population...

73
00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:28.783
doubles every 50 years.

74
00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:33.914
If we continue this way.
in 2081...

75
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:40.754
the Brazilian population will be
570 million...

76
00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:43.881
in other words. your kids.
grandkids. and great-grandkids.

77
00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:47.927
while the Brazilian prison
population...

78
00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:52.473
will be 510 million.

79
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:58.937
Your children. grand-children.
and great-grandchildren!

80
00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:03.608
In other words. 90% of Brazilians
will be in prison.

81
00:09:05.152 --> 00:09:07.152
Can you picture it? Huh. Julia?

82
00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:09.613
Is this the retirement
you had in mind?

83
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:13.867
But listen. don't worry.
don't worry...

84
00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:16.036
because this situation here
gets better.

85
00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:20.707
In 2083. all Brazilians
will be living here.

86
00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:24.460
In a gated community
like this one here.

87
00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:26.128
Bangu One.

88
00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:28.965
our first maximum
security prison.

89
00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:30.841
- What's up. Curio.
- Hey. how's it going?

90
00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:33.177
I'm gonna fix a
problem with Beirada...

91
00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:35.096
- but it's all good. ok?
- That's cool. partner.

92
00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:36.721
Here inside.
ladies and gentlemen...

93
00:09:36.723 --> 00:09:39.849
are the 40 guys
considered the most dangerous...

94
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:41.184
in Rio de Janeiro. 40!

95
00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:43.728
Ali Baba is outside.
He's at the palace.

96
00:09:44.064 --> 00:09:46.398
But the 40 are inside.
guaranteed.

97
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.109
Waddup.

98
00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.278
Yo. Curio.
What you got for us?

99
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.779
What's up. Beirada.

100
00:09:55.283 --> 00:09:58.117
Here. as we agreed...

101
00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:02.746
- Gimme.
- Here are the pieces.

102
00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:05.623
Here. hold this.

103
00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:07.125
All good. right?

104
00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:09.294
Yo. I'm checking it's all here.

105
00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:10.295
Tie him there.

106
00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:14.007
If you pay attention.
Bangu One will remind you

107
00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:16.009
of reality today in our city.

108
00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:19.679
Rio de Janeiro today
is. let's put it this way...

109
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.432
divided into 3 criminal factions
in constant conflict...

110
00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:26.351
and Bangu One is exactly
the same thing...

111
00:10:26.353 --> 00:10:27.436
- Tie him there.

112
00:10:27.438 --> 00:10:31.023
3 criminal factions feeding
the hatred...

113
00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:32.899
and rivalry among them.

114
00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:36.027
Goddamn it. Beirada.
what the fuck?

115
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.779
"What the fuck" is a shitload.
Shut up. shut your mouth.

116
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:40.323
You're getting a shitload of dough.

117
00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:43.909
Real quiet. Kids.
quiet. ok. Quiet.

118
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.040
A miserable bunch...

119
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:51.041
who never had a chance
at education...

120
00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:53.918
who never had any chance
in life...

121
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:58.840
locked and forgotten in the worst
conditions imaginable...

122
00:10:59.676 --> 00:11:02.052
and controlled by police...

123
00:11:02.054 --> 00:11:04.262
with strong tendencies toward
corruption.

124
00:11:05.473 --> 00:11:07.181
Beirada is out.

125
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.683
Notify the authorities
Bangu One's blowing up.

126
00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:12.603
Oh. and bring me coffee.
Hard bread sucks.

127
00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:34.206
- It's Quale that I want!
- Easy. easy!

128
00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:37.084
Out of the way. move. move. move.
Move. goddamn it.

129
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.752
Sit down!

130
00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:40.087
So you were gonna kill me?

131
00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:42.255
You gonna die.
You gonna get it in the ass.

132
00:11:42.383 --> 00:11:44.633
- I'm just a soldier. yo.
- That's the fucker.

133
00:11:44.635 --> 00:11:46.218
- I'm just a soldier.
- He's the boss.

134
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.970
Yet. some folks still
open their mouths to say...

135
00:11:48.971 --> 00:11:50.721
Brazil's the
country of impunity.

136
00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:54.266
It may even be. for one
particular sector of society.

137
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.104
Because for the others.
for the working classes...

138
00:11:58.106 --> 00:12:01.190
for mere mortals.
there's hell to pay.

139
00:12:01.858 --> 00:12:03.775
Put this shit in.
Put him in the oven.

140
00:12:04.903 --> 00:12:07.862
- Come on!
- Go to hell. cocksucker.

141
00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:09.030
The guy's gonna die!

142
00:12:09.866 --> 00:12:12.992
Hey. man. you fattened the pig.
now we're gonna roast it!

143
00:12:12.994 --> 00:12:16.121
There. get the mattress there.
Bring it. bring it.

144
00:12:22.002 --> 00:12:24.920
Go in. go in. Rape. soak him.

145
00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.798
- Our time. boss.
- Soak him. Now you'll...

146
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.924
Our time.
Bath time.

147
00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:31.135
...learn how to roast pork.
motherfuckers.

148
00:12:31.137 --> 00:12:33.137
- Bath!
- Soak him.

149
00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:41.936
Now let's go to the Third.

150
00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:44.021
Let's get that motherfucker
over there.

151
00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:47.775
You're surrounded.
You can't escape.

152
00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:49.276
Sons of bitches.

153
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.653
- Red assholes.
- I'm going to shoot.

154
00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:53.572
Pieces of shit.

155
00:12:53.824 --> 00:12:56.324
Whoever fears death.
homes. shouldn't be born. Got it?!

156
00:12:56.326 --> 00:12:57.826
We're at war!

157
00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:02.581
- Open this shit there. son.
- Let's fucking go!

158
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.836
What. bro?
Go fuck yourself. son!

159
00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:11.172
I don't negotiate with police.
Go to hell.

160
00:13:11.174 --> 00:13:13.048
If you come in. everyone will die.

161
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.593
Negotiate my cock!

162
00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.719
Call Fraga. call Fraga...

163
00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:19.387
I don't negotiate with police.

164
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:20.972
Open this shit. kid.

165
00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:26.811
I asked you to turn off
your phones and I left mine on.

166
00:13:27.063 --> 00:13:29.397
Just a moment.
Real quick.

167
00:13:31.108 --> 00:13:34.109
It's guys like Fraga who thugs
need when they start shit.

168
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:35.277
Right now?

169
00:13:40.075 --> 00:13:42.993
And the shit that Beirada started
changed Fraga's story...

170
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.622
and Rio's story...

171
00:13:47.874 --> 00:13:49.207
and my story.

172
00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.834
The punks set fire to Quale.

173
00:13:51.836 --> 00:13:54.420
He's on fire. but everyone's
in the main hall already.

174
00:13:54.422 --> 00:13:56.297
- Can you hear me?
- Affirmative.

175
00:13:56.299 --> 00:14:00.009
From here. I think it's
one long and two short.

176
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.093
I think it's a twelve-gauge
and two pistols.

177
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:05.639
The guards are tied to the bars.
close to you there.

178
00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:07.641
They want to break thru.
What door is that?

179
00:14:07.643 --> 00:14:10.644
- Third Command.
- Zoom in on that door.

180
00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:15.774
The guys want to enter
the wing of the Third.

181
00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:17.775
They want to kill everyone there too.

182
00:14:18.402 --> 00:14:19.985
They want in. we'll let 'em in.

183
00:14:19.987 --> 00:14:21.445
We'll let them in.

184
00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:24.323
Andre. get the squad
in position...

185
00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:26.242
but do nothing until
I give the order. understood?

186
00:14:26.244 --> 00:14:28.035
We're gonna let these guys
go in there.

187
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.871
- Understood? Do you copy?
- Affirmative. Colonel.

188
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:51.014
Zero One. in position.

189
00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:54.393
- Show me the squad.
- Monitor 4. Colonel.

190
00:14:57.398 --> 00:14:58.689
Confirm...

191
00:14:58.691 --> 00:15:01.900
Andre. confirm it's a twelve-gauge
in that punk's hand.

192
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.573
Where's the Third?
I wanna go into the fucking Third.

193
00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.577
Affirmative. Colonel.
Do you copy?

194
00:15:14.162 --> 00:15:15.287
Copy.

195
00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:25.422
Commander. we have a
good opportunity here.

196
00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:27.966
Nascimento. one minute...

197
00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:29.301
I need authorization
from the Governor.

198
00:15:29.302 --> 00:15:31.594
Just a minute. Pardon me.

199
00:15:31.637 --> 00:15:33.929
The Red Commandos killed
the heads of ADA.

200
00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:37.099
Nascimento wants authorization
to enter and finish the job.

201
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.851
Could be a good idea. Governor.

202
00:15:38.853 --> 00:15:40.185
It solves the problem completely.

203
00:15:40.187 --> 00:15:41.228
The public will support it.

204
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.855
Nobody tolerates these
assholes anymore.

205
00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:44.732
No. I don't want
another "Carandiru".

206
00:15:45.108 --> 00:15:47.609
- Where's the guy from human rights?
- I already sent him.

207
00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:49.611
He should be there soon.

208
00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:51.738
Tell Nascimento to buy some time.

209
00:15:55.327 --> 00:15:56.951
Does the Governor realize
the opportunity...

210
00:15:56.953 --> 00:15:58.620
we have right here. Commander?

211
00:15:59.246 --> 00:16:02.456
- And you'll let this guy go in?
- The man's here. Colonel.

212
00:16:05.002 --> 00:16:06.668
He's already here.

213
00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:11.089
Open this shit now.
I want the fucking Third. man!

214
00:16:12.092 --> 00:16:13.759
Sup. bro? Wassup?

215
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.344
Nascimento. let's deal
with this problem and...

216
00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:18.095
- not make it personal. Cool?
- Cool. Fraga.

217
00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:20.222
Unfortunately I cannot
authorize your entry.

218
00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:22.141
If I don't go in.
there'll be a bloodbath.

219
00:16:22.143 --> 00:16:23.434
- It's already started.
- I know.

220
00:16:23.436 --> 00:16:24.685
- It's already started.
- I know. I know.

221
00:16:24.687 --> 00:16:26.854
I don't want to pull
your body from there.

222
00:16:26.856 --> 00:16:28.356
Colonel. you have to understand...

223
00:16:28.357 --> 00:16:30.649
my entry's already been
authorized by your boss.

224
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:32.025
I'm going in.

225
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:33.902
Fraga!

226
00:16:35.656 --> 00:16:37.280
- The vest. Renan.
- No need.

227
00:16:37.282 --> 00:16:39.783
- No need. I won't use it.
- Wear the vest. Fraga.

228
00:16:40.035 --> 00:16:41.910
If I go in with a vest. Colonel...

229
00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:43.119
they won't trust me.

230
00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:50.250
Andre. Che Guevara here is
going in without a vest.

231
00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:59.009
Beirada. what the hell is this?

232
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.176
What's going on here?

233
00:17:00.178 --> 00:17:02.595
This fuck isn't coming close?

234
00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.600
He's right in front of you.
Andre. Can you hear me?

235
00:17:07.602 --> 00:17:09.018
With all due respect...

236
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.269
- Affirmative.
- With all due respect...

237
00:17:10.271 --> 00:17:12.063
we're solving our own problem.
understand?

238
00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:13.606
Solving your problem?
This way?!

239
00:17:13.607 --> 00:17:15.023
Beirada has a pistol in his hand.

240
00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:17.150
We gotta do what we gotta do.
you feel me. Fraga?

241
00:17:17.152 --> 00:17:18.944
- Let me tell you something...
- With all due respect.

242
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.613
BOPE is outside and is coming
to kill everyone.

243
00:17:21.615 --> 00:17:23.448
Fuck 'em! We'll kill all
these fuckers here.

244
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.033
They're not even here for
these people.

245
00:17:25.035 --> 00:17:28.203
Think! BOPE doesn't give a
shit about these guys.

246
00:17:28.204 --> 00:17:31.038
They haven't come in yet
because I'm fucking here.

247
00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:33.708
He's doing well.
Hold. stay calm.

248
00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:36.210
If I leave. you're fucked.
Release these guys.

249
00:17:36.212 --> 00:17:38.045
- You guarantee?
- I guarantee. Let them go.

250
00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:39.672
- You guarantee. Fraga?
- Do it. Beirada.

251
00:17:39.674 --> 00:17:41.674
- Man to man.
- I'll stay. Let them go.

252
00:17:41.967 --> 00:17:43.049
Think. damn it.

253
00:17:43.468 --> 00:17:46.219
Let these guys go so I can come
in and talk with you. Do it.

254
00:17:48.223 --> 00:17:50.098
Do it. Let them go.

255
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.439
- Let these guys go. Beirada.
- You guarantee. Fraga?

256
00:17:57.815 --> 00:17:59.690
If I leave. you're fucked.

257
00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:02.234
Let's end this
as quickly as possible.

258
00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.658
Let them go and
let's get this over with.

259
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.952
Enough damn killings.
Let's end this.

260
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.996
- Do it. Let them go.
- Paulinho. let these guys go.

261
00:18:14.998 --> 00:18:16.122
- Let them go.
- Okay.

262
00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.958
Let them fucking go.

263
00:18:19.252 --> 00:18:21.627
He's untying the hostages. Andre.
He's untied one.

264
00:18:21.838 --> 00:18:23.755
The man's in control of
the situation. Andre.

265
00:18:23.757 --> 00:18:25.715
Hold. Stay put.

266
00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:30.886
He opened the door. Okay?

267
00:18:31.013 --> 00:18:32.637
He opened the door.
he's letting them go.

268
00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:35.098
One's out. two's out.
Fraga went in.

269
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.850
Easy. he's in charge. Andre.

270
00:18:36.852 --> 00:18:40.979
Stop. Andre! Stop. Andre!
Fuck.

271
00:18:48.863 --> 00:18:51.113
Don't shoot. damn it!
Don't shoot!

272
00:18:51.115 --> 00:18:52.865
- He's gonna die. son.
- Lower your gun. Beirada.

273
00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:53.866
Lower my gun. fuck that.

274
00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:55.117
Lower your gun. he won't shoot.

275
00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:56.744
- He will. bro.
- Do you hear. Captain?

276
00:18:56.745 --> 00:18:59.704
- Let the hostage go.
- He won't shoot anymore. It's over.

277
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.290
No one will shoot anymore.
do you hear. Captain?

278
00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:08.421
- Lower your gun. Beirada.
- Lower my gun. my ass.

279
00:19:08.423 --> 00:19:10.131
- Shit.
- No more shooting. Captain!

280
00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:13.134
Lower your gun. Lower your gun
coz it's over. It's over. Beirada.

281
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:16.011
- Listen. Beirada. it's over.
- Let him go.

282
00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:17.805
- You can trust me.
- It's a trick. son.

283
00:19:17.807 --> 00:19:19.765
Trust me. Beirada. It's over.
Lower the damn gun.

284
00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:22.643
Lower your gun.
trust me. Lower it.

285
00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:27.147
Matias seized his chance.

286
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:30.149
He did as trained in BOPE.

287
00:19:30.276 --> 00:19:32.777
He killed the punk to
protect the hostage.

288
00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:35.780
The problem. my friend.
is that a.762 bullet makes...

289
00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:37.323
a small entry hole...

290
00:19:38.201 --> 00:19:41.160
but the exit hole is
the size of a tangerine.

291
00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:46.790
The team entered and in
less than a minute...

292
00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:48.166
we had the problem resolved.

293
00:19:48.168 --> 00:19:50.085
Matias eliminated the toughest guy

294
00:19:50.087 --> 00:19:51.558
in the history of Red Commandos.

295
00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.671
Hands on your head!

296
00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:55.048
There was just one detail
that spoiled everything.

297
00:19:55.758 --> 00:19:57.716
That fucking T-shirt.

298
00:19:57.718 --> 00:20:00.427
"Human Rights" written
in English and covered in blood...

299
00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:02.680
That shit turned into
headlines the world over.

300
00:20:02.682 --> 00:20:05.599
A massacre. total carnage.
that's what happened inside.

301
00:20:05.852 --> 00:20:08.602
The Governor will have to explain how.
after he promised me...

302
00:20:08.604 --> 00:20:11.605
that there would be no massacre.
immediately after...

303
00:20:11.606 --> 00:20:13.857
Colonel Nascimento
and Captain Matias...

304
00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:16.109
executed the prisoners
in cold blood.

305
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:18.236
Because it was an execution.
It was an execution.

306
00:20:18.238 --> 00:20:20.613
Give us more details.
Was there a negotiation?

307
00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:21.948
No. No time for negotiation.

308
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.868
The bullets from Captain Matias. on
orders from Colonel Nascimento...

309
00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:25.993
got there first.

310
00:20:25.995 --> 00:20:29.788
BOPE entered only and exclusively
to kill and they killed.

311
00:20:29.957 --> 00:20:33.208
In fact. they did what they're used to
doing in the slums of Rio.

312
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.253
Ethnic cleansing.
Social cleansing.

313
00:20:36.255 --> 00:20:39.089
That's what they do.
And that's what they're paid for.

314
00:20:39.091 --> 00:20:41.091
To be cowards.

315
00:20:41.092 --> 00:20:43.634
BOPE today were cowards
in that prison...

316
00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:45.761
just as they are cowards
in our community.

317
00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:00.358
I'd like. just one time.

318
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.237
to see BOPE invade
and arrest a drug dealer...

319
00:21:04.239 --> 00:21:05.655
in a luxury condo.

320
00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:07.657
But it's not what they do. right.

321
00:21:07.659 --> 00:21:09.367
Mr. Secretary of Public Security?

322
00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:13.037
There. the Skulls don't go in.
do they. Mr. Chief of Police?

323
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:15.164
So you think that BOPE
acted with excessive force?

324
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:16.749
Is this what doomed
the operation?

325
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.877
What we can't admit is that
a representative of the State...

326
00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:22.922
is more violent than those
that we want...

327
00:21:22.924 --> 00:21:25.257
in prison for violent crimes.

328
00:21:25.425 --> 00:21:28.635
It's absurd.
This is becoming routine.

329
00:21:28.637 --> 00:21:32.013
This is becoming normal.
And no one thinks it's odd?

330
00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:35.058
To have a police force
whose symbol is a skull?

331
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.769
To have a police force
whose symbol is death?

332
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:40.813
I find this inexplicable.
Mr. Governor.

333
00:21:44.902 --> 00:21:46.944
I'm perplexed.

334
00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:49.154
Sir. you will have to give
an explanation.

335
00:21:49.156 --> 00:21:51.698
And it won't do to say that
Colonel Nascimento...

336
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.283
ignored your orders.

337
00:21:53.285 --> 00:21:55.911
Yes. Colonel Nascimento
was a coward.

338
00:21:55.912 --> 00:21:58.704
Yes. he led the entire massacre.

339
00:21:58.831 --> 00:22:01.332
But the one who orders
the police is the Governor.

340
00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:03.084
It's all his responsibility.

341
00:22:03.086 --> 00:22:05.878
Fuck. I did everything to save
Fraga and the guy bashed me.

342
00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:10.174
I never butted into Rosane's life
after we separated.

343
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.425
But marrying him was a low blow.

344
00:22:13.053 --> 00:22:15.845
The guy went around filling
my son's head with bullshit.

345
00:22:27.608 --> 00:22:29.984
It's best you don't come in.
Did you read the paper today?

346
00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:35.739
So why isn't Formoso here
talking to me now?

347
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:40.076
Why can't I talk to Formoso?

348
00:22:40.203 --> 00:22:41.369
So when...

349
00:22:42.247 --> 00:22:43.955
So when he comes to talk to us...

350
00:22:43.957 --> 00:22:47.208
we'll speak to the press. Pinheiro.
Cheers.

351
00:22:47.627 --> 00:22:50.628
Commander. the decision to
go in was mine.

352
00:22:51.214 --> 00:22:52.338
I'm the one who killed.

353
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.215
Let me take responsibility alone.

354
00:22:54.216 --> 00:22:55.757
The responsibility is mine. Andre.

355
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.761
The responsibility is mine.
I'm in command.

356
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.221
Colonel. you'll excuse me...

357
00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:05.017
but if we're gonna go down.
better to go down shooting.

358
00:23:05.644 --> 00:23:07.352
Our unit is being thrown
to the dogs.

359
00:23:07.354 --> 00:23:09.771
Let's call the press
and let the shit hit the fan.

360
00:23:09.772 --> 00:23:11.105
Let's fuck these bastards. sir.

361
00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:12.273
Andre. you heard what I said?

362
00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:14.358
You heard my conversation
with Pinheiro just now?

363
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.778
- Were you listening? You heard?
- Yes. sir.

364
00:23:19.157 --> 00:23:21.115
So you want to fight
with the Governor? Now?

365
00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:24.118
In the press? You want to fuck
the Battalion over?

366
00:23:25.996 --> 00:23:27.370
You don't want this.

367
00:23:29.249 --> 00:23:31.124
Lupe. did you find
the Commander-General?

368
00:23:31.126 --> 00:23:32.625
No. he went to lunch.

369
00:23:32.627 --> 00:23:34.669
Then find out where
and let me know.

370
00:23:34.671 --> 00:23:36.796
These guys are afraid
to talk to me.

371
00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:39.298
I'm not afraid to talk to them.

372
00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:42.134
After the accusations from
the representative...

373
00:23:42.136 --> 00:23:45.137
of Human Rights AID that
reverberated around world...

374
00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:48.932
Guanabara Palace said
that they will relieve from duty...

375
00:23:48.934 --> 00:23:52.770
the BOPE officers involved in the
occupation of the Bangu One prison.

376
00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:54.020
True.
But if not Otavio...

377
00:23:54.022 --> 00:23:55.188
who will you put. Guaracy?

378
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.690
Who it'll be. or who it
won't be. matters little.

379
00:23:57.942 --> 00:24:01.069
The Governor wants that son a bitch
Nascimento discharged tomorrow.

380
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:02.153
- Okay.
- End of story.

381
00:24:02.155 --> 00:24:03.571
Let's resolve this quickly.

382
00:24:03.573 --> 00:24:05.823
We'll quickly put.
promote the sub-commander?

383
00:24:05.825 --> 00:24:06.908
- Renan?
- Quickly.

384
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:08.033
- Good idea.
- Yeah. Renan.

385
00:24:08.035 --> 00:24:10.786
Later we'll see who to put
in his place and done.

386
00:24:10.788 --> 00:24:11.953
True.

387
00:24:12.956 --> 00:24:14.164
Oh shit.
Don't look now...

388
00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:15.957
but that asshole
is coming in right now.

389
00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:17.918
- Who?
- Fucking Nascimento. Look.

390
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.003
The Governor needed a scapegoat.

391
00:24:20.172 --> 00:24:22.422
He put Beirada's death on me.

392
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.175
But for the public. my friend.
a good thug is a dead thug.

393
00:24:33.226 --> 00:24:34.934
Well done.

394
00:24:37.062 --> 00:24:39.187
Go talk to him.
Go hug him.

395
00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.855
Go talk to him.
Go talk to him.

396
00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:44.192
Colonel! Welcome.

397
00:24:45.112 --> 00:24:46.736
What a pleasant surprise.

398
00:24:47.197 --> 00:24:48.321
Welcome.

399
00:25:01.877 --> 00:25:04.962
Now I'd like to ask for a
little of your attention...

400
00:25:04.964 --> 00:25:08.132
gentlemen.
and your attention ladies.

401
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.217
Queixada. close in.

402
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:14.053
Open up. Imperador.

403
00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:18.099
Governor of this wonderful
state...

404
00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:20.893
of Rio de Janeiro.
pay attention.

405
00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.108
Do you know what this is. Governor?

406
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.235
Big steps.

407
00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:33.113
It's what's happening
to our city...

408
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.908
which is taking big steps
toward barbarism.

409
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.121
Governor. do not discharge
Colonel Nascimento of duty.

410
00:25:42.248 --> 00:25:46.250
Because if you do. it'll stink.

411
00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:50.921
Stink with a capital S.

412
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.799
Because you would be giving
the green light...

413
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:59.095
for them to return to the streets.
prowl the bars...

414
00:25:59.097 --> 00:26:03.057
the plazas. the schools. offering
drugs to our sons...

415
00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:04.934
to our daughters.

416
00:26:07.396 --> 00:26:12.191
Governor. you would
be turning our city...

417
00:26:13.027 --> 00:26:17.571
into an enormous pool of blood.

418
00:26:19.158 --> 00:26:21.575
Is this what you want?

419
00:26:22.285 --> 00:26:25.286
To transform our city...

420
00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:28.706
into an enormous pool of blood?

421
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:30.291
No!

422
00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:33.544
Don't do that.

423
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.048
Do this right now.

424
00:26:37.174 --> 00:26:39.009
Close in. Queixada.

425
00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:41.134
Close in. Imperador.

426
00:26:42.304 --> 00:26:44.846
"Dagger in the Skull"...

427
00:26:45.724 --> 00:26:48.141
and strike these thugs.

428
00:26:48.143 --> 00:26:50.852
Release the steel.
Finger on the trigger.

429
00:26:51.145 --> 00:26:53.562
The man's show has a
a rating of almost 30 points.

430
00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:56.232
They get tons of letters
from the audience.

431
00:26:57.293 --> 00:26:59.193
- The tide will turn. Governor.
- Now I'm a fan...

432
00:26:59.195 --> 00:27:00.319
I know what I'm doing.

433
00:27:00.321 --> 00:27:02.613
...of Colonel Nascimento...
- Nascimento is out of BOPE.

434
00:27:02.615 --> 00:27:04.949
my wife is a fan.
even my dog Diana...

435
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.742
is a fan of Colonel Nascimento.

436
00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:12.121
Don't transform our city
into a pool of blood.

437
00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:16.084
Combat trafficking now.

438
00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:50.741
And that's how Fraga toppled
me from the command of BOPE.

439
00:27:52.244 --> 00:27:56.342
Only. I didn't fall down. my friend.
I fell up.

440
00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:57.914
Mr. Sub-secretary. good morning.

441
00:27:58.166 --> 00:28:00.917
I'm Valmir Magalhaes.
coordinator here of SSI.

442
00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:04.796
The Secretary asked me to
welcome you. Please.

443
00:28:04.797 --> 00:28:07.047
If voters were saying
that I was a hero...

444
00:28:07.216 --> 00:28:09.216
who was the Governor
to say otherwise?

445
00:28:09.218 --> 00:28:11.677
Renata. please send me
the report.

446
00:28:17.143 --> 00:28:18.642
If you'll be so kind...

447
00:28:20.395 --> 00:28:23.062
in a while. we'll need to
record your fingerprints.

448
00:28:23.064 --> 00:28:25.189
The first day I was almost lost.

449
00:28:25.191 --> 00:28:26.722
Hell. I never had a computer before.

450
00:28:26.724 --> 00:28:27.670
The room.

451
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.779
How could I be
Sub-secretary of Intelligence?

452
00:28:32.282 --> 00:28:33.948
How could I be responsible...

453
00:28:33.949 --> 00:28:35.699
for all the wiretaps of
Rio de Janeiro?

454
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:38.952
- This is all wiretapping?
- That's Monitoring.

455
00:28:40.205 --> 00:28:42.080
You can see we have
cameras there...

456
00:28:42.082 --> 00:28:44.333
we have access to all
the cameras in the city.

457
00:28:45.252 --> 00:28:47.961
This is the Watchdog.
where we log...

458
00:28:47.962 --> 00:28:50.171
all phone interceptions.

459
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.214
It would be difficult...

460
00:28:52.216 --> 00:28:54.675
but I had landed where
no Skull had ever been.

461
00:28:54.969 --> 00:28:58.095
In the Secretariat of Security.
I wouldn't be fighting only drugs.

462
00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:00.556
I'd be able to fight the system.

463
00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:03.100
Commander. this Skull
will fuck up our scheme...

464
00:29:03.101 --> 00:29:04.100
in our unit. goddamn it.

465
00:29:04.102 --> 00:29:05.977
Put him in an operation.
let him take a shot...

466
00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:07.103
friendly fire and done...

467
00:29:07.105 --> 00:29:08.855
- bury him with military honours.
- Captain.

468
00:29:08.857 --> 00:29:11.066
You have been very well
commended in this battalion...

469
00:29:11.068 --> 00:29:12.275
but I'm in command. goddamn it.

470
00:29:12.277 --> 00:29:13.693
You're gonna fuck up
our scheme.

471
00:29:13.695 --> 00:29:15.070
- Fuck our scheme.
- This is fucked.

472
00:29:15.072 --> 00:29:16.279
- This is fucked.
- What. Mario?

473
00:29:16.281 --> 00:29:17.697
What the fuck is "this"?

474
00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:22.117
I'm telling you. We can't lay
a finger on a Skull. goddamn it.

475
00:29:22.286 --> 00:29:25.120
It's an order. He's my friend.

476
00:29:25.706 --> 00:29:27.498
He saved my life one time.

477
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.708
I'll put him in a corner
out of the way.

478
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.835
Forget this fucking shit.

479
00:29:32.004 --> 00:29:35.881
Fuck up my battalion here.
Tell the Captain to enter.

480
00:29:35.965 --> 00:29:38.132
Then it's on you. okay. Commander.

481
00:29:38.885 --> 00:29:41.010
It seemed all was going
to end well.

482
00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:43.596
But things were beginning
to crumble.

483
00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.640
The Governor. who wasn't
an idiot at all...

484
00:29:45.642 --> 00:29:47.308
decided to please the left.

485
00:29:47.893 --> 00:29:51.311
Someone had to pay for the blood
on the shirt of human rights.

486
00:29:52.523 --> 00:29:54.523
Permission to present myself.
Colonel.

487
00:29:54.525 --> 00:29:56.733
What a pleasure. trainee.

488
00:29:56.735 --> 00:29:59.736
The mere thought of Matias
wearing that blue uniform...

489
00:29:59.738 --> 00:30:00.904
gave me hives.

490
00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:03.281
Mr. Secretary. I'd like
if you could intercede...

491
00:30:03.282 --> 00:30:05.282
with the Governor
in relation to the situation...

492
00:30:05.284 --> 00:30:06.909
of Captain Andre Matias.

493
00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:11.163
It's not fair for him
to be in that unit.

494
00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:14.750
Matias is one of the best
cops we have.

495
00:30:16.337 --> 00:30:19.755
It's not right for him to be there.
it's not correct. it's not fair.

496
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:24.050
I was in command of the
operation at Bangu. Mr. Secretary.

497
00:30:25.887 --> 00:30:27.804
I'd like you to take this...

498
00:30:27.806 --> 00:30:29.764
as a personal request from me.

499
00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:34.310
Well. Colonel. I think your
position is commendable.

500
00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:36.061
I think your request is fair.

501
00:30:37.314 --> 00:30:39.898
I will speak to the Governor.
touch on this subject.

502
00:30:40.192 --> 00:30:41.775
I'm sure he will understand.

503
00:30:41.777 --> 00:30:45.279
Matias. I knew that Nascimento
was an asshole. partner.

504
00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:47.281
He thinks he's got the biggest cock.

505
00:30:47.282 --> 00:30:50.658
But betrayal. I didn't expect that.
That's bullshit.

506
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.953
The guy there in the government
and you expelled from BOPE?

507
00:30:53.955 --> 00:30:56.831
- Son of a bitch.
- Fabio. don't meddle in this shit...

508
00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:58.374
- It's not your business.
- What's wrong?

509
00:30:58.376 --> 00:30:59.959
- Don't meddle.
- Relax. Matias.

510
00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:00.960
Stay out of this.

511
00:31:00.961 --> 00:31:02.210
I'll make you relax.

512
00:31:02.212 --> 00:31:04.588
I'll put you where you can relax.

513
00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:07.382
Trust me! You're going
to relax big time. partner.

514
00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:18.226
- This is where you'll be.
- Fucking hell. Fabio.

515
00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:20.352
Central Archives. It's important!

516
00:31:21.564 --> 00:31:23.355
Organize this shit for me. okay?

517
00:31:23.357 --> 00:31:26.942
I tried to help Matias. but
he couldn't stand the humiliation.

518
00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:30.237
He called Clara Vidal. the most
controversial journalist in the city...

519
00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:31.864
May I record what you're saying?

520
00:31:31.865 --> 00:31:33.698
You may. I'll repeat.

521
00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:35.366
...and let the shit hit the fan.

522
00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:37.994
It's cowardly for the Governor...

523
00:31:38.246 --> 00:31:40.830
to blame me for the prison deaths.

524
00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:43.750
BOPE has been abandoned
for long time.

525
00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:47.587
Cops go into the streets to
kill thugs every day.

526
00:31:47.588 --> 00:31:49.379
I can't accept this cowardice.

527
00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:52.132
Especially from a government
that only thinks about politics...

528
00:31:52.134 --> 00:31:53.842
and only thinks of themselves.

529
00:31:55.012 --> 00:31:57.763
The Governor was furious
and Matias was completely fucked.

530
00:31:57.848 --> 00:31:59.640
On top of being in a unit
of corrupt cops...

531
00:31:59.642 --> 00:32:01.725
he got 30 days in jail.

532
00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:04.268
May I come in?

533
00:32:17.157 --> 00:32:19.366
How can I get you
out of here. Andre?

534
00:32:21.286 --> 00:32:24.037
"BOPE Officer Blames Governor"

535
00:32:24.623 --> 00:32:26.915
What are you trying to
accomplish by stirring shit up?

536
00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:28.542
- I don't get it.
- Stirring shit. Colonel?

537
00:32:28.544 --> 00:32:31.294
You mean. telling the truth.
defending the Battalion...

538
00:32:31.295 --> 00:32:32.628
is stirring shit up?

539
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:33.754
Watch your tone with me.

540
00:32:33.756 --> 00:32:35.172
- I was telling the truth.
- Show respect!

541
00:32:35.174 --> 00:32:36.173
Watch your tone with me.

542
00:32:36.175 --> 00:32:38.634
Don't talk to me about
defending the Battalion.

543
00:32:44.641 --> 00:32:46.808
You defend the Battalion
doing what I taught you.

544
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.893
Not giving interviews
to papers.

545
00:32:55.318 --> 00:32:57.777
You're in jail. Andre.

546
00:32:58.822 --> 00:33:01.322
You'll defend what from here?
You're in jail. old friend.

547
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:06.827
If there's anyone here...

548
00:33:06.829 --> 00:33:08.787
here in this room who can
defend the Battalion...

549
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:10.205
excuse me. but it's not you.

550
00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:12.082
I can defend the Battalion
from the SSI.

551
00:33:12.084 --> 00:33:13.208
- I can do...
- Colonel...

552
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.335
for the unit what no one
has ever done for the unit.

553
00:33:15.336 --> 00:33:16.544
- Colonel...
- I can.

554
00:33:16.546 --> 00:33:19.547
Colonel. with all due respect.

555
00:33:21.301 --> 00:33:24.093
these sons of bitches
that you're mingling with...

556
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.095
only care about politics.

557
00:33:27.682 --> 00:33:30.600
The only thing that'll change
with you inside the Secretariat...

558
00:33:31.935 --> 00:33:33.602
is yourself.

559
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:38.231
Unless you've already changed. huh?

560
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.537
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

561
00:33:54.123 --> 00:33:56.957
To make things worse. Fraga
turned his 15 minutes of fame...

562
00:33:56.959 --> 00:33:58.542
into a candidacy
for state representative.

563
00:33:58.543 --> 00:33:59.584
...campaign proposals...

564
00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:00.710
what I'd like you...

565
00:34:00.712 --> 00:34:02.587
Of course. all the intellectuals
on the left...

566
00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:04.964
and all the potheads
would vote for him.

567
00:34:04.966 --> 00:34:07.258
Hi. how are you? Some
proposals from my campaign.

568
00:34:07.552 --> 00:34:09.260
I don't want you
stuck in front of him.

569
00:34:09.262 --> 00:34:11.137
I want you circling.
Circling.

570
00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.388
Don't stop in front of him.

571
00:34:13.099 --> 00:34:15.266
This armchair Che Guevara
already pissed me off...

572
00:34:15.267 --> 00:34:17.726
as NGO head.
imagine what he'd do...

573
00:34:17.728 --> 00:34:19.728
if he held public office.

574
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.146
It would be fucked up.

575
00:34:21.273 --> 00:34:23.982
And my family would be
caught in the crossfire.

576
00:34:23.984 --> 00:34:26.401
Grab the kimono with
both hands. Rafa!

577
00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:28.862
The kimono with both hands. Rafa!

578
00:34:30.114 --> 00:34:31.989
I won't deny it.
I like fighting.

579
00:34:32.575 --> 00:34:34.992
For me. only those who can
fight can live in peace.

580
00:34:37.997 --> 00:34:39.789
I only wanted to teach
this to my son...

581
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:42.041
without worrying about
the opinion of others.

582
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:43.959
Come on. Rafa. Come on. come on!

583
00:34:44.711 --> 00:34:47.045
Sit up! Good. good. good.

584
00:34:47.547 --> 00:34:49.631
Good. Rafa. Good. Rafa.

585
00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:59.557
Good. Good.

586
00:34:59.558 --> 00:35:01.642
Watch the sweep. the sweep.

587
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.949
All good. All good.

588
00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:20.576
You know the only thing
I didn't like?

589
00:35:20.578 --> 00:35:23.663
Your hand loose.
You have to grab here...

590
00:35:23.665 --> 00:35:26.165
Both hands on the kimono.
No hand loose.

591
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:29.168
- I didn't want to fight.
- Didn't want to fight?

592
00:35:29.169 --> 00:35:31.628
You pestered me all month
long to come fight.

593
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.171
Why didn't you want
to fight. son?

594
00:35:33.507 --> 00:35:35.173
We're here. let's fight
to win now.

595
00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:36.842
We won't lose.
Fight to win.

596
00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:39.636
I'm not like you.
beating people up.

597
00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:57.528
How are you?

598
00:36:01.742 --> 00:36:03.032
Have you calmed down?

599
00:36:05.787 --> 00:36:08.538
Beto. the problem isn't what
Rafa does or doesn't hear.

600
00:36:08.665 --> 00:36:09.748
It's what you do.

601
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.791
The man tells my son
I'm a murderer...

602
00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:13.792
- and the problem is what I do?
- He didn't.

603
00:36:13.794 --> 00:36:15.627
He spoke on TV and Rafa heard.

604
00:36:15.629 --> 00:36:17.546
Ah. right. On TV. he can?
On TV. it's okay?

605
00:36:17.673 --> 00:36:19.047
Did he lie?

606
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.258
I'm a cop. Rosane.

607
00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.718
I'm not. I'm not...
A coffee.

608
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.094
I'm not gonna argue
this with you.

609
00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:25.846
A coffee. please.

610
00:36:25.848 --> 00:36:27.890
I'm not gonna argue with
you either...

611
00:36:27.891 --> 00:36:29.682
the definition of murderer.

612
00:36:30.268 --> 00:36:32.810
I just won't hide the
truth from my son.

613
00:36:33.062 --> 00:36:34.562
If you don't want
to lose Rafa...

614
00:36:34.564 --> 00:36:36.105
- That's what you think?
...speak to...

615
00:36:37.108 --> 00:36:39.859
That's what you think I am. now?

616
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.320
Doesn't matter what I think.

617
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.613
If you want to be
close with Rafa...

618
00:36:44.615 --> 00:36:46.072
you'll have to tell him the truth.

619
00:36:46.074 --> 00:36:48.074
I won't lie to my son.

620
00:36:48.076 --> 00:36:50.243
You'll have to find
a way to explain to him...

621
00:36:50.245 --> 00:36:51.870
what you do for a living. Beto.

622
00:36:59.128 --> 00:37:01.879
Battalion. Attention!

623
00:37:02.673 --> 00:37:04.882
Battalion. At ease!

624
00:37:05.718 --> 00:37:07.551
My son was afraid of me...

625
00:37:07.845 --> 00:37:09.845
...Rosane considered me
a fascist...

626
00:37:09.847 --> 00:37:12.014
...Matias considered me
a traitor.

627
00:37:13.183 --> 00:37:14.849
I should have been
depressed. my friend.

628
00:37:15.602 --> 00:37:17.101
But I wasn't.

629
00:37:17.103 --> 00:37:19.020
My mission was more important...

630
00:37:19.022 --> 00:37:20.647
than my personal problems.

631
00:37:20.649 --> 00:37:23.900
Gentlemen. BOPE is a
fundamental part...

632
00:37:24.152 --> 00:37:26.778
of our mandate of
public security.

633
00:37:28.072 --> 00:37:32.908
I have total confidence
in your abilities.

634
00:37:33.285 --> 00:37:36.578
- Together always.
- Skulls!

635
00:37:37.164 --> 00:37:39.331
I dove into my work. my friend.

636
00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:41.583
I exorcized my demons...

637
00:37:41.584 --> 00:37:44.085
in Rio's Secretariat of
Public Security

638
00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:45.670
Skulls!

639
00:37:45.672 --> 00:37:49.340
Go and defeat.
Know no defeat.

640
00:37:49.592 --> 00:37:53.553
- Special Ops!
- Bravo. well done.

641
00:37:53.555 --> 00:37:54.433
Bravo!

642
00:37:54.434 --> 00:37:56.639
I did what I told Matias I'd do.

643
00:37:56.849 --> 00:37:59.099
I turned BOPE
into a war machine.

644
00:37:59.935 --> 00:38:01.643
With me in the Secretariat
of Security...

645
00:38:01.645 --> 00:38:03.687
BOPE got up to 390 officers...

646
00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:05.355
and 16 tactical teams.

647
00:38:05.858 --> 00:38:08.149
Before. we had 8 cars.

648
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:11.987
Now. we had armoured cars
and a helicopter.

649
00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:23.789
For some. war is cure.

650
00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:26.959
War acts as an escape valve.

651
00:38:27.794 --> 00:38:30.795
When pressure mounts at home.
vent it on the streets.

652
00:38:31.673 --> 00:38:33.214
With me. it was always like that.

653
00:39:03.912 --> 00:39:05.661
There! Hit there.

654
00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:22.802
Pinheiro. can you hear me?

655
00:39:23.013 --> 00:39:25.972
Concentrate fire at the top.
they're gonna come down.

656
00:39:27.224 --> 00:39:28.974
Look there. Keep it there.

657
00:39:31.854 --> 00:39:33.228
Let's go!
Let's go!

658
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.981
You can go in. Pinheiro.
Send everyone up.

659
00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:37.858
Do you copy. Pinheiro?

660
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.860
After I arrived at the
Secretariat of Security...

661
00:39:40.153 --> 00:39:42.153
the thugs no longer had peace.

662
00:39:42.864 --> 00:39:44.530
The war machine I helped set up...

663
00:39:44.532 --> 00:39:46.866
busted trafficking in Rio.

664
00:39:46.993 --> 00:39:48.743
It was only a matter of time.

665
00:39:48.954 --> 00:39:52.580
With trafficking out of the game.
the corruption spree would end.

666
00:39:52.749 --> 00:39:55.291
Finally. I would fuck up the system.

667
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:03.006
In theory. my plan had
everything to succeed.

668
00:40:03.092 --> 00:40:05.759
The less pot and cocaine consumed...

669
00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:07.511
the less return from trafficking.

670
00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.846
Hey. Marcinho. what you got
for us. son?

671
00:40:09.847 --> 00:40:11.889
Hey listen. We ain't got
nothing for you.

672
00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:13.265
Ah. don't give me that. Marcinho.

673
00:40:13.267 --> 00:40:15.017
I came here. bro. you
gotta lay some eggs.

674
00:40:15.019 --> 00:40:16.060
...your buddies killed...

675
00:40:16.062 --> 00:40:18.604
If the dealers broke.
the dirty cops would break too.

676
00:40:18.606 --> 00:40:19.605
Sup. buddy?

677
00:40:19.607 --> 00:40:21.565
We're choking. can't
sell nothing. Rocha.

678
00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:22.274
Marcinho.

679
00:40:22.276 --> 00:40:23.901
Come on. buddy.
let go the loot. son.

680
00:40:23.902 --> 00:40:26.194
Listen. we only got
500 bones from cable TV.

681
00:40:26.196 --> 00:40:28.238
You make me come up here
for 500 fucking bones?

682
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.781
- Beat it. son.
- Shut up. pothead.

683
00:40:29.783 --> 00:40:31.533
- Go fuck yourself.
- Go fuck yourself. bro.

684
00:40:31.535 --> 00:40:32.784
Come on. Rocha.

685
00:40:32.786 --> 00:40:35.078
Give my hood a break. man.

686
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.079
Don't sweat.

687
00:40:36.081 --> 00:40:38.748
When the scratch is light.
my friend. the love is gone.

688
00:40:41.544 --> 00:40:43.293
Let's go. Santos.
Check it out. Goncalves.

689
00:40:43.295 --> 00:40:45.629
Yay. there's already 20 here.

690
00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:47.798
Check the wallet. check
his backpack too.

691
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.967
Take the watch. Good.
Leave them there.

692
00:40:50.136 --> 00:40:53.554
Without their cut from drugs. the
crooks wouldn't get along anymore.

693
00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:55.555
Damn. took Marcinho out?

694
00:40:55.557 --> 00:40:57.849
You want to fuck me.

695
00:40:57.851 --> 00:41:00.101
30 per week? What is that?

696
00:41:00.103 --> 00:41:02.645
Wanna fuck the unit over?
Wanna fuck me out of my command?

697
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.567
Colonel. every dog licks
his own dick.

698
00:41:08.152 --> 00:41:09.276
And another thing...

699
00:41:09.278 --> 00:41:11.570
Who said you're in command?

700
00:41:12.948 --> 00:41:14.614
- Commander. your subordinate...
- Fabio!

701
00:41:14.616 --> 00:41:16.658
...challenging me.
disrespecting me...

702
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.909
- ordering around...
- Easy. Fabio.

703
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:19.870
I'll hold him 30 days.
then run him over.

704
00:41:19.872 --> 00:41:21.830
Captain Rocha is key
to the administration.

705
00:41:21.832 --> 00:41:23.331
But he's demoralizing me.

706
00:41:23.332 --> 00:41:25.624
I have to satisfy
a lot of interests. Fabio.

707
00:41:25.626 --> 00:41:26.792
I'm in command. Formoso!

708
00:41:26.794 --> 00:41:29.962
Colonel. what do you want?
You want another post?

709
00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:31.881
You want to switch unit?

710
00:41:31.883 --> 00:41:33.966
I'll switch you.
But you'll be fucked. okay?

711
00:41:35.678 --> 00:41:37.053
A suggestion.

712
00:41:37.055 --> 00:41:38.804
You won the lottery. Fabio.

713
00:41:38.805 --> 00:41:40.638
Don't throw it away.

714
00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.184
With all due respect.
listen to me.

715
00:41:44.186 --> 00:41:46.019
Dismissed. Colonel Fabio.

716
00:41:46.313 --> 00:41:48.855
And I was gonna kill two birds
with one stone.

717
00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:50.315
Son of a bitch.

718
00:41:50.567 --> 00:41:52.817
That would have been the
first step in the clean-up...

719
00:41:52.818 --> 00:41:54.610
of the Military Police of Rio.

720
00:41:55.154 --> 00:41:57.696
Except. in practice.
everything went wrong.

721
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:03.327
The guys are coming up there.

722
00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:05.079
These guys. fuck.
What. faggot?

723
00:42:05.081 --> 00:42:06.163
Don't start with that.

724
00:42:06.165 --> 00:42:09.124
What actually happened was
not what I had planned

725
00:42:09.334 --> 00:42:10.792
What you got for us. son?

726
00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:12.627
Here's the deal. bro.

727
00:42:12.629 --> 00:42:14.879
I only have 500 Reals to
give you. Rocha.

728
00:42:14.881 --> 00:42:17.006
Where's this dough coming from
if you can't sell?

729
00:42:17.008 --> 00:42:18.549
- You're selling your ass now?
- Fuck that!

730
00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:20.134
That shit's from cable TV.
Rocha.

731
00:42:20.136 --> 00:42:21.177
That shit ain't from drugs. bro.

732
00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:22.470
From cable TV?
Talk to me!

733
00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:25.180
This shit here. each resident's
gotta give us 12 Reals.

734
00:42:25.182 --> 00:42:26.848
Got it? That's nothing.

735
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.850
Just so that each resident
can have a TV at home.

736
00:42:28.852 --> 00:42:32.646
Yep. nothing like an economic
crisis to trigger innovation.

737
00:42:32.898 --> 00:42:35.315
It only took the loss of drug bribes
for the crooked cops...

738
00:42:35.317 --> 00:42:37.067
to see the obvious.

739
00:42:37.068 --> 00:42:38.943
Each poor neighbourhood in Rio...

740
00:42:38.945 --> 00:42:41.153
is much more than
a place to sell drugs.

741
00:42:41.155 --> 00:42:42.738
Come on. Rocha.

742
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.074
Give my hood a break. man.

743
00:42:45.076 --> 00:42:46.325
Don't sweat.

744
00:42:46.452 --> 00:42:48.494
Who said this is your hood?

745
00:42:51.623 --> 00:42:53.706
Rocha realized.
by eliminating the middleman...

746
00:42:53.708 --> 00:42:55.875
the system grossed more.

747
00:42:56.044 --> 00:42:58.670
It was obvious.
It was simple math.

748
00:42:58.922 --> 00:43:01.047
Hey. Irineu? Selling
many subscriptions?

749
00:43:01.049 --> 00:43:02.882
Hey. boss. Soon. there
won't be enough poles!

750
00:43:02.884 --> 00:43:04.509
No. We'll arrange poles.
Just continue.

751
00:43:04.511 --> 00:43:06.678
Slum folks like cable TV.

752
00:43:07.179 --> 00:43:08.262
Hey. Valdir.

753
00:43:08.264 --> 00:43:10.055
Slum folks drink water.

754
00:43:10.683 --> 00:43:12.266
Slum folks get online.

755
00:43:12.268 --> 00:43:14.685
People connecting?
...Damn!

756
00:43:14.687 --> 00:43:16.687
Everyone's plugged in!
Here. Santos.

757
00:43:16.897 --> 00:43:18.689
Slum folks cook with gas.

758
00:43:18.691 --> 00:43:22.484
Pops. I'm confiscating this.
I'm gonna leave it there.

759
00:43:22.861 --> 00:43:26.654
You'll go down the slope.
take the first left.

760
00:43:27.073 --> 00:43:29.907
Go to Danilo Baiano. there
you'll buy gas.

761
00:43:29.909 --> 00:43:31.242
Hurry. it's closing.

762
00:43:31.244 --> 00:43:32.743
Slum folks take out loans.

763
00:43:32.745 --> 00:43:35.705
We're not like just any
bankers. Mrs. Severina.

764
00:43:35.706 --> 00:43:38.206
We're fair. But here.
you have to pay.

765
00:43:38.208 --> 00:43:39.457
- I know.
- You have to pay.

766
00:43:39.459 --> 00:43:41.960
Aranha. I'm outta here. ok.
I zeroed the register.

767
00:43:41.962 --> 00:43:43.712
- No worries.
- Ready?

768
00:43:43.714 --> 00:43:45.046
I just need your name...

769
00:43:45.048 --> 00:43:46.464
Every slum is a huge market...

770
00:43:46.466 --> 00:43:48.258
of purchases and sales.

771
00:43:48.969 --> 00:43:51.970
Rocha figured out it was better
to tax the whole slum...

772
00:43:51.971 --> 00:43:53.971
than a bunch of fucked-up
drug dealers.

773
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:57.892
Each time money changed hands.
Rocha took a tax.

774
00:43:58.186 --> 00:44:00.144
The crooks' own Robin Hood tax.

775
00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:02.980
Motherfuckers robbin' the hood.

776
00:44:03.482 --> 00:44:06.233
Pretext? To defend the
hood from trafficking.

777
00:44:06.651 --> 00:44:08.735
The truth was quite different.

778
00:44:08.737 --> 00:44:11.112
This fucking van doesn't
make much. dude.

779
00:44:11.114 --> 00:44:12.238
Barely enough for one. man.

780
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.073
How can I split with you. Rocha?

781
00:44:14.242 --> 00:44:16.534
You won't split?
I'll give you a break.

782
00:44:16.536 --> 00:44:18.828
It's 90% for us and
10% for you. ok?

783
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.289
What? Are you crazy. dude?
I have a family to feed.

784
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.831
10% ain't enough for anyone!

785
00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:25.000
Marreco. take over this shit.

786
00:44:25.836 --> 00:44:27.586
Beat this bitch.
Marreco. fuck him up!

787
00:44:27.588 --> 00:44:28.962
- Bring him here.
- Fuck him up!

788
00:44:28.964 --> 00:44:30.505
Leave him to me.

789
00:44:30.507 --> 00:44:32.174
You don't wanna pay the tax.
huh. bitch?!

790
00:44:32.176 --> 00:44:33.675
Good.

791
00:44:34.928 --> 00:44:35.968
My turn.

792
00:44:38.598 --> 00:44:41.140
- Let's take a walk!
- Let's take a walk. yeah. Yeah!

793
00:44:41.726 --> 00:44:43.267
Santos. Santos.

794
00:44:43.519 --> 00:44:45.853
Shake him well to jiggle his head.

795
00:44:45.855 --> 00:44:47.813
You gotta pay the tax. kid.

796
00:44:48.942 --> 00:44:50.274
Fuck him up.

797
00:45:03.956 --> 00:45:06.206
Whereas Fabio pulled in
30.000 every month...

798
00:45:06.207 --> 00:45:08.749
Rocha pulled in 300.000.
tax-free.

799
00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:16.173
In 4 years. the system
took over almost all...

800
00:45:16.175 --> 00:45:18.175
the West Side of Rio.

801
00:45:19.052 --> 00:45:22.053
In the past. we invaded and
the dealers came back.

802
00:45:22.889 --> 00:45:25.556
But when the dirty cops
started occupying the slums...

803
00:45:25.558 --> 00:45:27.809
the dealers didn't come back.

804
00:45:30.605 --> 00:45:33.898
For a while. I thought the
system was helping BOPE.

805
00:45:34.108 --> 00:45:37.776
But really. it was BOPE
helping the system.

806
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.573
Yeah. I helped create the monster
that was going to devour me.

807
00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:46.827
(Present time)

808
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:50.247
What's worse is that only
one person realized this...

809
00:45:51.124 --> 00:45:53.207
Representative Diogo Fraga.

810
00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:56.919
You know what I found
about homicides...

811
00:45:56.921 --> 00:45:58.254
in the areas of the militia?

812
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.007
Many witnesses started dying.

813
00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:02.249
It was Rocha's gang.

814
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:03.801
They killed my brother.

815
00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:06.052
More than 20 shots.
in front of everyone.

816
00:46:06.054 --> 00:46:09.222
And before dying. these same
witnesses gave new statements.

817
00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:11.808
- Then who was it?
- Who it was. I don't know. ma'am.

818
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.643
I know who didn't do it.
It wasn't Rocha.

819
00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:15.770
You can put that down.
It wasn't Rocha.

820
00:46:16.148 --> 00:46:19.232
Wherever there's militia.
there's profit and death...

821
00:46:19.692 --> 00:46:22.860
fostered by public agents
in charge of security.

822
00:46:26.073 --> 00:46:28.115
In practice. the militia is the
mafia.

823
00:46:28.117 --> 00:46:31.076
You pay them to protect
you from them.

824
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.048
With the growth of militias...

825
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.258
Fraga found another cause...

826
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.968
in the name of human rights.

827
00:46:49.094 --> 00:46:52.220
And like all good politicians.
he exploited it to the fullest.

828
00:46:53.098 --> 00:46:55.182
Because. on top of the violence
that you can see here...

829
00:46:55.184 --> 00:46:57.434
they talk as if they're legitimate.

830
00:46:57.895 --> 00:47:00.645
Of protection. of self-defence
against trafficking...

831
00:47:00.647 --> 00:47:02.481
but. in reality. they want control.

832
00:47:02.899 --> 00:47:04.982
Damn! That's a lot of bullets.
huh. Fraga.

833
00:47:04.984 --> 00:47:08.903
Yeah. What we're dealing with
is the mafia. Mr. President.

834
00:47:08.905 --> 00:47:11.155
Because that's what it is.
The militia is the mafia.

835
00:47:11.157 --> 00:47:13.199
True organized crime.

836
00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:15.451
Permission to speak.
Representative. President.

837
00:47:15.453 --> 00:47:17.244
You may speak. Representative.

838
00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:19.621
Fraga. for the love of God.

839
00:47:19.956 --> 00:47:22.749
You're talking about the mafia.
son? Nonsense.

840
00:47:22.751 --> 00:47:26.002
The mafia are Italians who
love pasta. rondelli. gnocchi.

841
00:47:26.296 --> 00:47:28.755
- Rep. Fortunato. I...
- We love rice and beans.

842
00:47:28.757 --> 00:47:31.925
I'm a huge fan of your sense
of humour. you know that.

843
00:47:31.927 --> 00:47:33.718
But I think it fits better
on your show.

844
00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:35.928
In Italy there's no trafficking.
you know that.

845
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.013
- No trafficking?!
- This is hood self-protection.

846
00:47:38.015 --> 00:47:39.932
Yes. but folks are dying
in these hoods.

847
00:47:39.934 --> 00:47:41.683
- Hood self-protection.
- Self-protection?

848
00:47:41.685 --> 00:47:42.976
That's what you call it?

849
00:47:42.978 --> 00:47:44.478
Pay them to protect from them.

850
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.896
- Go there. see if...
- I go there!

851
00:47:45.898 --> 00:47:47.481
You have any idea
how many people...

852
00:47:47.482 --> 00:47:49.023
die in these neighbourhoods?

853
00:47:49.025 --> 00:47:50.483
- They're protecting themselves.
- Any idea?

854
00:47:50.485 --> 00:47:53.194
- Decorum! Decorum. please!
- Forgive me. Mr. President.

855
00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:55.488
Listen. Let me tell you
something. Fraga.

856
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:58.658
We're in an election year.
Everyone's in campaign mode.

857
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.535
- You have your own campaign.
- Election year?

858
00:48:00.537 --> 00:48:01.994
It's like any other year for me.

859
00:48:01.995 --> 00:48:03.995
- What! Don't say that.
- You know very well that...

860
00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:05.997
a CPI enquiry in an election year...

861
00:48:05.999 --> 00:48:08.542
- turns into campaigning.
- No. Mr. President...

862
00:48:08.544 --> 00:48:10.627
I just think that this matter
is more important...

863
00:48:10.629 --> 00:48:13.549
than whatever election year.
That's my position.

864
00:48:13.966 --> 00:48:15.924
Look. Fraga. I'm not saying
you're wrong...

865
00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.509
nor that he's right.

866
00:48:17.718 --> 00:48:20.511
What I'm saying is this:
In an election year...

867
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.930
I will not accept your CPI.

868
00:48:22.932 --> 00:48:25.182
Clear your head.
think about something else...

869
00:48:25.184 --> 00:48:28.227
Fraga's strategy was to fight
the government head-on.

870
00:48:28.521 --> 00:48:31.730
He loved provoking us to
see what came out in the media.

871
00:48:32.149 --> 00:48:34.149
Fraga wanted to be a federal
representative...

872
00:48:34.484 --> 00:48:37.235
and a CPI would be his
ticket to the capital. Brasilia.

873
00:48:38.196 --> 00:48:41.030
But 4 years later.
everyone still believed...

874
00:48:41.032 --> 00:48:43.241
that my plan had worked.

875
00:48:43.243 --> 00:48:46.077
Guaracy was cashing in from
my blows on trafficking.

876
00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:47.495
Good morning. Mr. Governor.
Good morning.

877
00:48:47.496 --> 00:48:48.704
It was so successful...

878
00:48:48.706 --> 00:48:50.539
that he ditched the
Secretariat of Security...

879
00:48:50.541 --> 00:48:51.999
and left to be a federal
congressman.

880
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:53.917
- How are you? Good?
- I already went ahead.

881
00:48:53.919 --> 00:48:55.669
The Governor in the center.
please.

882
00:48:55.671 --> 00:48:58.046
Vermont. I'm not convinced
about this tie. Yellow?

883
00:48:58.048 --> 00:48:59.006
- It's great!
- Gold.

884
00:48:59.008 --> 00:49:00.507
- Yellow's nice. Governor.
- It's nice.

885
00:49:00.509 --> 00:49:02.759
Even the Governor was
reaping the fruits of my labour.

886
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.553
His re-election was guaranteed.

887
00:49:06.473 --> 00:49:09.098
The problem was. the more
votes Guaracy won...

888
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.850
the more Fraga criticized me.

889
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.852
And the more he criticized me...

890
00:49:13.104 --> 00:49:15.104
the more my son distanced
himself from me.

891
00:49:18.484 --> 00:49:20.525
Rafael. if you want a ride.
I'm leaving.

892
00:49:21.028 --> 00:49:22.527
OK.

893
00:49:25.032 --> 00:49:26.740
This is for Fraga.

894
00:49:30.578 --> 00:49:32.786
- Fraga.
- Thanks. kid.

895
00:49:33.247 --> 00:49:35.581
Julia is leaving now.
Can I go with her?

896
00:49:35.583 --> 00:49:38.000
- Of course. You can go.
- Thanks.

897
00:49:38.294 --> 00:49:39.960
Thanks for today.

898
00:49:42.215 --> 00:49:43.964
Ready to go?

899
00:49:44.592 --> 00:49:45.841
Let's go.

900
00:49:48.136 --> 00:49:51.846
Yeah. my friend. just when
things couldn't get worse.

901
00:49:52.557 --> 00:49:54.807
After Fraga became state
representative...

902
00:49:55.143 --> 00:49:57.268
I couldn't even look
him in the face.

903
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.645
Here it is. Representative.

904
00:49:58.897 --> 00:50:02.065
She just needs to sign this
document...

905
00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:06.610
appear in court and that's all.

906
00:50:06.612 --> 00:50:09.029
Understood. Here. Julia.

907
00:50:10.074 --> 00:50:13.075
Read carefully.
don't rush. then sign.

908
00:50:13.994 --> 00:50:16.995
- Barata. how's it going?
- Colonel. how are you?

909
00:50:16.996 --> 00:50:18.829
- Good.
- What happened here?

910
00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.582
- Nothing. it's all resolved.
- Can I see the statement?

911
00:50:21.584 --> 00:50:22.875
- Of course.
- Beto...?

912
00:50:23.461 --> 00:50:24.835
I was going to tell you.

913
00:50:24.837 --> 00:50:26.003
Can I read?
He's my son.

914
00:50:26.005 --> 00:50:27.547
Rafa had nothing to do with this.

915
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:28.577
Can we remain civil?

916
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:31.092
Tell him not to talk to me.

917
00:50:31.301 --> 00:50:33.176
Calm down. calm down.

918
00:50:37.015 --> 00:50:38.640
100 grams. Barata?

919
00:50:40.102 --> 00:50:41.851
You were buying for the
entire office. miss?

920
00:50:41.853 --> 00:50:43.478
A moral lecture. now?

921
00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.772
Barata. look. my son is 16.

922
00:50:46.148 --> 00:50:48.190
Nowadays. that's
corruption of minors.

923
00:50:49.318 --> 00:50:52.111
And 100 grams. nowadays.
that's drug trafficking.

924
00:50:52.113 --> 00:50:53.112
Beto. stop it.

925
00:50:53.114 --> 00:50:55.281
I said. don't talk to me.

926
00:50:55.283 --> 00:50:56.699
- Folks. please.
- I told you...

927
00:50:56.701 --> 00:50:59.326
to shut your mouth and
not speak to me.

928
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.829
- Shut your mouth!
- Dad!

929
00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:04.497
The pot was mine.

930
00:51:04.624 --> 00:51:07.166
You can put that down. sir.
the pot was mine.

931
00:51:15.217 --> 00:51:16.592
His father is right.

932
00:51:16.594 --> 00:51:18.510
100 grams of pot is no joke.

933
00:51:18.512 --> 00:51:20.137
Hey. you shouldn't have
taken the blame.

934
00:51:20.139 --> 00:51:23.473
Yeah? And let her get arrested?
Because of your argument?

935
00:51:23.684 --> 00:51:25.684
That has nothing to do
with it. Rafael.

936
00:51:25.978 --> 00:51:27.519
By the way. you
have to fire her.

937
00:51:27.521 --> 00:51:28.562
Why would I fire her?

938
00:51:28.564 --> 00:51:29.563
For exposing Rafa.

939
00:51:29.564 --> 00:51:31.063
She took responsibility.
didn't she?

940
00:51:31.065 --> 00:51:32.898
Rafa is right. If there's
a problem here...

941
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.983
it's not her.

942
00:51:34.152 --> 00:51:35.318
OK. if you don't...

943
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.652
Rafa won't work there anymore.

944
00:51:36.654 --> 00:51:38.195
That's what he wants.
Exactly what he wants.

945
00:51:38.197 --> 00:51:39.905
He wants us to fight.
to push Rafa from me.

946
00:51:39.907 --> 00:51:40.906
That's exactly it.

947
00:51:40.908 --> 00:51:42.158
You think this was normal?

948
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.200
No. not normal. Rosane.

949
00:51:43.202 --> 00:51:44.910
Just like it wasn't normal
how he acted.

950
00:51:44.911 --> 00:51:46.244
He was deciding the kid's life.

951
00:51:46.246 --> 00:51:48.705
He didn't decide. He arrived
at the station...

952
00:51:48.707 --> 00:51:50.498
and his son was there with
100 grams of pot.

953
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.875
Right in front of us.

954
00:51:51.877 --> 00:51:53.752
He wants what's best
for his son.

955
00:51:53.754 --> 00:51:54.961
At no time did he ask us...

956
00:51:54.963 --> 00:51:56.546
I'm tired.
I lost my appetite.

957
00:51:56.548 --> 00:51:58.506
You're acting just like my father.

958
00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.014
Of course. I didn't want
to hear what Fraga...

959
00:52:07.016 --> 00:52:08.724
was saying about the militias.

960
00:52:08.726 --> 00:52:10.684
It was hard separating things.

961
00:52:11.187 --> 00:52:13.687
That's why I couldn't see
what was happening...

962
00:52:13.688 --> 00:52:15.521
in Rio.

963
00:52:15.523 --> 00:52:18.107
The system was changing. evolving.

964
00:52:18.652 --> 00:52:21.944
Before. politicians used
the system to make money.

965
00:52:22.197 --> 00:52:25.573
Now they depended on the
system to get elected.

966
00:52:26.201 --> 00:52:27.700
You understand?

967
00:52:27.952 --> 00:52:29.952
The sports centre is
already open...

968
00:52:29.953 --> 00:52:31.578
the kids are playing sports.

969
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.163
The renovation of the
public square...

970
00:52:33.165 --> 00:52:34.665
is on its way.
trash collection...

971
00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.249
You know you have our support.

972
00:52:36.251 --> 00:52:38.210
The Governor is here
so I can't lie.

973
00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:41.922
You can be sure that
one of our priorities...

974
00:52:41.924 --> 00:52:44.549
- is the support of the community.
- Governor. speechless.

975
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:46.759
Sincerely. Just a moment.
Just a moment.

976
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:48.594
Just a moment. godfather.

977
00:52:48.596 --> 00:52:50.805
Paquito. take a picture.
Paquito. damn it.

978
00:52:50.807 --> 00:52:52.765
You're too slow.

979
00:53:05.987 --> 00:53:09.072
Relax. folks. today
it's in celebration.

980
00:53:11.034 --> 00:53:12.492
It's in celebration.

981
00:53:12.952 --> 00:53:16.578
I'd like to thank you all in
the community for being here.

982
00:53:16.706 --> 00:53:18.997
We're very happy for you.

983
00:53:18.999 --> 00:53:23.627
But I couldn't begin this
without honouring...

984
00:53:23.629 --> 00:53:26.046
3 people very important to us.

985
00:53:26.048 --> 00:53:29.758
First. the honourable
Governor Gelino...

986
00:53:29.759 --> 00:53:32.719
up for re-election.
Thank you. Governor.

987
00:53:34.472 --> 00:53:36.639
You will be re-elected here
by the community.

988
00:53:36.641 --> 00:53:38.766
You can count on that.

989
00:53:38.768 --> 00:53:40.810
Thank you. Governor.

990
00:53:41.938 --> 00:53:44.731
I'd also like to note
the presence of...

991
00:53:44.732 --> 00:53:47.107
the Secretary of Public Security
in Rio. Guaracy.

992
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:49.234
Thank you. Guaracy.

993
00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:53.864
Guaracy who is now a fed.

994
00:53:53.866 --> 00:53:55.657
Thanks to us as well.

995
00:53:55.659 --> 00:54:00.495
And our eternal godfather.
Representative Fortunato.

996
00:54:00.496 --> 00:54:02.663
Thank you. Representative.

997
00:54:02.749 --> 00:54:05.875
- I'm your fan.
- We're with you.

998
00:54:06.043 --> 00:54:07.835
- Thank you. thank you.
- We're with you.

999
00:54:08.588 --> 00:54:09.628
A blessing.

1000
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:13.257
Today is a celebration
of 4 years...

1001
00:54:13.258 --> 00:54:16.968
of our Community Center
of Rio das Rochas!

1002
00:54:18.638 --> 00:54:19.804
It's all ours!

1003
00:54:19.806 --> 00:54:22.807
Let's do some samba now
and tear this shit up.

1004
00:54:30.983 --> 00:54:33.066
Waddup. Yeah. baby.

1005
00:54:33.068 --> 00:54:34.568
Beautiful.

1006
00:54:34.862 --> 00:54:38.030
Oh. lovely.

1007
00:54:40.242 --> 00:54:45.704
"A new leader is born
in the hills of the flagpole."

1008
00:54:45.705 --> 00:54:47.163
Remember what I told you before?

1009
00:54:47.165 --> 00:54:49.791
In the slums. cash flows.
deals are closed...

1010
00:54:49.793 --> 00:54:51.834
and the system levies a tax?

1011
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:55.046
Well. yeah. but I skipped
one thing. my friend.

1012
00:54:55.548 --> 00:54:57.882
In Brazil. elections are business...

1013
00:54:57.883 --> 00:55:01.718
and votes are the most valuable
commodity in the slums.

1014
00:55:02.596 --> 00:55:05.138
Didn't take long for Guaracy.
Fortunato. and Gelino...

1015
00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:08.558
to realize the militia expanded
the Governor's constituency.

1016
00:55:09.853 --> 00:55:13.188
The more slums the militia controlled.
the more votes they got.

1017
00:55:14.607 --> 00:55:16.524
Hey. Fabio? You like the boat?

1018
00:55:16.526 --> 00:55:18.442
Fuck. you gotta appreciate
me more. Rocha.

1019
00:55:18.444 --> 00:55:20.861
- I'm at the front lines.
- Shit. you got balls.

1020
00:55:20.863 --> 00:55:22.446
You're already bitching?
Hey. Santos.

1021
00:55:22.448 --> 00:55:24.865
- Why you bitching?
- Shit. Fabio. listen...

1022
00:55:24.867 --> 00:55:26.659
I didn't bring you here for this.

1023
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:27.867
Here's the deal.

1024
00:55:27.869 --> 00:55:30.745
We're taking the whole West Side.
Tanque will be ours.

1025
00:55:30.747 --> 00:55:31.788
You're gonna help me.

1026
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.414
Fuck. bro. that's
gonna be a bitch.

1027
00:55:33.416 --> 00:55:35.625
There's more guns there
than in my unit.

1028
00:55:35.627 --> 00:55:37.710
- Just a moment.
- Fabio. take it easy. man.

1029
00:55:37.712 --> 00:55:40.129
Something's happening right now
that'll change our lives.

1030
00:55:40.429 --> 00:55:42.727
(Police Station. Tanque area)

1031
00:55:42.762 --> 00:55:44.424
Go. go!
Come on!

1032
00:55:45.135 --> 00:55:48.136
- Don't fuck with me!
- Why you looking at me?

1033
00:55:48.764 --> 00:55:50.681
- On the ground.
- Let's go.

1034
00:55:50.683 --> 00:55:52.057
- Come on!
- Come on. goddamn it.

1035
00:55:52.768 --> 00:55:55.185
- Game over.
- I'm gonna fuck you up!

1036
00:55:56.729 --> 00:55:57.854
- Face the wall.
- Wait!

1037
00:55:58.147 --> 00:55:59.605
Easy. easy!

1038
00:55:59.607 --> 00:56:02.149
Don't fuck around. so no one
gets hurt. all right?

1039
00:56:02.151 --> 00:56:03.568
- Are you the Chief?
- Yes. sir.

1040
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.152
The key for the reserve arsenal!

1041
00:56:05.154 --> 00:56:06.946
- Take it easy.
- The fucking key quickly!

1042
00:56:07.949 --> 00:56:10.491
Face on the fucking floor.

1043
00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:13.451
Here. the rifles are here.

1044
00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:15.996
Hello. Yeah. Sem Alma.

1045
00:56:16.665 --> 00:56:18.415
Good. son. good.

1046
00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:20.959
Scratch them but
don't bury them. ok.

1047
00:56:21.169 --> 00:56:23.628
Don't bury them. we'll need them.

1048
00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:25.964
Thanks. Speak. Fabio.
What's your question?

1049
00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:28.132
- Something I don't understand.
- Speak. damn it.

1050
00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:29.633
We wanted the Skull
out of the way.

1051
00:56:29.635 --> 00:56:31.594
We did. but not anymore.

1052
00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:33.012
- Why not?
- To take Tanque...

1053
00:56:33.014 --> 00:56:34.805
who am I gonna entrust?

1054
00:56:34.807 --> 00:56:36.181
The crooks in your battalion?

1055
00:56:36.183 --> 00:56:38.517
Are you fucking kidding me?

1056
00:56:39.811 --> 00:56:41.185
He's such a joker. isn't he?

1057
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:44.188
Romance your woman. Fabio.

1058
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:46.941
- Shit. relax.
- Shit. I'm annoyed.

1059
00:56:48.945 --> 00:56:51.446
Militiamen are primitive
but not stupid.

1060
00:56:51.448 --> 00:56:52.488
You love me.

1061
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:55.533
Tanque was the last stronghold
of trafficking on the West Side.

1062
00:56:55.534 --> 00:56:57.492
Let's go. Mariguela.
Ready?

1063
00:56:57.494 --> 00:57:00.454
Lots of money there
and lots of votes.

1064
00:57:00.915 --> 00:57:02.664
But lots of guns too.

1065
00:57:02.666 --> 00:57:04.875
Let's record. ok. Roll VT.

1066
00:57:05.836 --> 00:57:08.795
Rolling. 4. 3...

1067
00:57:08.797 --> 00:57:11.673
The militia could never take
Tanque alone.

1068
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.509
What's happening to
our city Rio de Janeiro?

1069
00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:19.972
What's happening to
our wonderful city?

1070
00:57:21.476 --> 00:57:26.187
Thugs come into a police
station and steal weapons.

1071
00:57:26.188 --> 00:57:30.732
Weapons from inside
a police station!

1072
00:57:31.652 --> 00:57:34.819
This isn't crime. no sir.

1073
00:57:34.988 --> 00:57:36.780
This is terrorism!

1074
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:40.867
Don't talk to me
about human rights...

1075
00:57:40.868 --> 00:57:43.702
because terrorists.
to me. aren't people.

1076
00:57:43.996 --> 00:57:46.747
It's because of "blah. blah.
blah. human rights".

1077
00:57:46.791 --> 00:57:49.041
Can't touch the thugs
Don't touch the thugs.

1078
00:57:49.043 --> 00:57:50.709
Don't touch the thugs.

1079
00:57:50.836 --> 00:57:53.003
Give candy to the thugs.

1080
00:57:53.464 --> 00:57:55.881
Send roses to the thugs.

1081
00:57:56.007 --> 00:57:58.216
This is a circus. man.

1082
00:57:59.052 --> 00:58:01.511
Here. close in on me. Imperador.

1083
00:58:03.556 --> 00:58:05.264
Governor...

1084
00:58:09.728 --> 00:58:12.771
you know what this is?
This is a little dance.

1085
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.190
This is what will happen
to your administration.

1086
00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:17.901
Your administration will dance
if you don't respond...

1087
00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:20.862
because these thugs
will take these guns...

1088
00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:23.865
to take on your government.

1089
00:58:23.866 --> 00:58:27.034
We can't let that happen.
What is this. people?

1090
00:58:27.245 --> 00:58:29.078
What is this?

1091
00:58:29.747 --> 00:58:32.873
They want to fight
the administration...

1092
00:58:33.084 --> 00:58:36.127
that best cleaned up this city...

1093
00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.963
of narcotics trafficking.

1094
00:58:39.965 --> 00:58:41.756
Governor...

1095
00:58:42.634 --> 00:58:45.719
Destroy them!

1096
00:58:48.223 --> 00:58:51.808
Secretary. I have to admit that
this asshole can speak.

1097
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:54.810
I agree. Governor...

1098
00:58:54.812 --> 00:58:56.562
- I'm talking to Guaracy.
- He's right.

1099
00:58:56.564 --> 00:58:58.772
If we play weak now.
we'll lose votes.

1100
00:58:58.774 --> 00:59:00.065
We have to strike...

1101
00:59:00.067 --> 00:59:01.942
to guarantee these elections.

1102
00:59:01.944 --> 00:59:03.902
Listen. bystanders could
end up dead...

1103
00:59:03.904 --> 00:59:05.946
- with this kind of operation.
- Excuse me.

1104
00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:08.115
Governor. the campaign
materials are in.

1105
00:59:09.576 --> 00:59:11.409
I decide these things. Formoso.

1106
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:12.410
Sure.

1107
00:59:12.579 --> 00:59:14.412
Let's go see the campaign
materials.

1108
00:59:14.414 --> 00:59:17.874
- Goddamn. I don't believe it.
- You like it?

1109
00:59:17.876 --> 00:59:19.125
- Vermont...
- It's very good.

1110
00:59:19.127 --> 00:59:21.085
- Very good.
- You've outdone yourself.

1111
00:59:21.087 --> 00:59:22.837
- Great. isn't it?
- Don't you think?

1112
00:59:22.838 --> 00:59:25.630
It looks like shit.
Look at this gold tie.

1113
00:59:25.966 --> 00:59:27.132
I told you it wouldn't work.

1114
00:59:27.134 --> 00:59:29.926
It won't connect with the
public. It's not popular.

1115
00:59:30.429 --> 00:59:33.597
Look at Fortunato's tooth.
that broken tooth.

1116
00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:35.849
This speaks to the people.
you understand?

1117
00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:38.977
All the campaign material
must be redone. ok?

1118
00:59:38.978 --> 00:59:39.852
- Redo it?
- Do it.

1119
00:59:39.854 --> 00:59:42.897
Governor. we already owe
a ton of suppliers.

1120
00:59:43.566 --> 00:59:45.775
You owe? Pay with this.

1121
00:59:45.777 --> 00:59:49.070
You can't vote for an administration
that can't even protect a station.

1122
00:59:49.405 --> 00:59:53.407
Either the Governor would respond
or the press would eat him alive.

1123
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:55.158
How many? You remember?

1124
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.118
And that's what the militia
was betting on.

1125
00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.620
...or 8.

1126
00:59:58.955 --> 01:00:01.873
7 or 8.
And they assaulted you?

1127
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.043
They came in here.
beat everyone.

1128
01:00:06.046 --> 01:00:08.004
They cleaned everything out.

1129
01:00:08.047 --> 01:00:11.048
Could you identify any
dealer from the area?

1130
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:17.679
Turn that off.

1131
01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.643
It's off.

1132
01:00:23.394 --> 01:00:26.646
What I'm about to tell you.
you didn't hear from me. ok?

1133
01:00:27.565 --> 01:00:29.190
They weren't dealers at all.

1134
01:00:29.901 --> 01:00:32.193
They came in with combat boots...

1135
01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:34.403
Show us where the
reserve arsenal is.

1136
01:00:34.405 --> 01:00:36.656
They referred to the
"reserve arsenal".

1137
01:00:36.657 --> 01:00:38.657
That's not the
vocabulary of dealers.

1138
01:00:38.659 --> 01:00:40.909
Cops? So it was the militia.

1139
01:00:40.911 --> 01:00:42.619
He said that?
That it was the militia?

1140
01:00:42.621 --> 01:00:43.703
No. he didn't say that.

1141
01:00:44.414 --> 01:00:46.832
Because he was afraid
to say anything.

1142
01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:49.417
But think about it.
the guy's Chief of Police...

1143
01:00:49.419 --> 01:00:51.461
he heard them speak.
He understands. right?

1144
01:00:51.462 --> 01:00:52.503
The language.

1145
01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:54.171
Sure. Of course.
Yeah. it's possible.

1146
01:00:55.174 --> 01:00:57.007
It's very possible. in fact.

1147
01:00:57.009 --> 01:00:58.676
You know what I think
about the militia?

1148
01:00:58.678 --> 01:01:00.469
I know. That's why
I came straight here.

1149
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.722
- Rafa! Do me a favour?
- Yeah?

1150
01:01:04.058 --> 01:01:06.684
Bring a complete copy of
the file on the militias...

1151
01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:08.434
to give to Clara. please.

1152
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:09.978
- OK.
- Thanks.

1153
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.897
- You're giving me the militia file?
- This is very serious. Clara.

1154
01:01:12.899 --> 01:01:14.607
- I know.
- What we're talking about...

1155
01:01:14.609 --> 01:01:16.901
is the worst problem in Rio.

1156
01:01:16.903 --> 01:01:19.529
It's the mafia.
Thanks. Rafa.

1157
01:01:20.448 --> 01:01:22.699
I have no doubt that the
militia is involved.

1158
01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:26.201
You have no idea what the
militia is capable of.

1159
01:01:26.704 --> 01:01:29.454
Look. this is the file with
the main clues on all...

1160
01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:30.497
we've been talking about.

1161
01:01:30.499 --> 01:01:33.458
If you help me expose this...

1162
01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:36.086
I'll serve the CPI.

1163
01:01:37.547 --> 01:01:39.797
Take it. read it with care.

1164
01:01:40.133 --> 01:01:42.133
I'll read it and speak to my
editor. all right?

1165
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.678
- Excuse me. Colonel.
- Close the door.

1166
01:01:48.933 --> 01:01:50.057
Yes. sir?

1167
01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:52.434
The Governor wants to
take Tanque.

1168
01:01:52.436 --> 01:01:54.436
- I know.
- A massive operation.

1169
01:01:54.438 --> 01:01:56.188
He thinks the weapons are there.

1170
01:01:57.191 --> 01:01:59.566
- Are you getting feeds from there?
- Yes. I am.

1171
01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:03.820
So mobilize everyone.
I want to hear everything. ok?

1172
01:02:03.822 --> 01:02:05.488
- Got it.
- We have little time.

1173
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.490
That's right.
The militia was so sure...

1174
01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:10.701
that the government would
rid Tanque of the dealers...

1175
01:02:10.953 --> 01:02:14.121
that they were already recruiting
people to keep them out.

1176
01:02:15.124 --> 01:02:17.124
And to scare dealers. my friend...

1177
01:02:17.126 --> 01:02:19.126
nothing better than the Skulls.

1178
01:02:19.128 --> 01:02:20.502
Ah. he's here.

1179
01:02:20.545 --> 01:02:23.504
Sup. Fabio.
Hey. buddy.

1180
01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.756
Sup. Rocha.

1181
01:02:24.758 --> 01:02:27.759
Sup. Matias. How you doing. man?
A beer. please.

1182
01:02:27.761 --> 01:02:29.010
Good?

1183
01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:32.430
- Cool. mate?
- What do you want with me?

1184
01:02:32.766 --> 01:02:34.140
What I want is simplicity.

1185
01:02:34.142 --> 01:02:36.184
Look at the neighbourhood. partner.
Just look.

1186
01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.518
A mother can walk with
her son peacefully.

1187
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520
The vans are working.
Look at the MP there.

1188
01:02:40.522 --> 01:02:43.148
No one has to hide their wallet
to go to work anymore.

1189
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.149
It's not like before.

1190
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:45.984
It was a fucking mess. partner.

1191
01:02:45.986 --> 01:02:47.778
And there's no more theft.

1192
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.613
The slum is damn good to live in.

1193
01:02:49.864 --> 01:02:52.531
- What's that got to do with me?
- Shit. Matias.

1194
01:02:52.533 --> 01:02:55.368
I learned that the police will do
a massive operation in Tanque.

1195
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:58.120
If the MP invades. it'll
be easy for us to occupy it.

1196
01:02:58.122 --> 01:03:00.498
And I don't know anyone
better than you to...

1197
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.124
- manage this here.
- Me?

1198
01:03:02.543 --> 01:03:03.793
Fucking Skulls. man.

1199
01:03:03.795 --> 01:03:05.795
Someone the thugs fear.

1200
01:03:05.796 --> 01:03:06.878
Aren't you a Skull?

1201
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.838
You'll understand what I'm saying.

1202
01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:13.134
Godfather. can you hear me?

1203
01:03:13.762 --> 01:03:16.388
- Talk to me.
- Godfather. listen.

1204
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.556
What can we do to return
a friend to BOPE?

1205
01:03:18.558 --> 01:03:21.184
- Help him out.
- Is he solid? Can I trust him?

1206
01:03:21.602 --> 01:03:23.560
More than solid. godfather. 100%.

1207
01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:24.728
The best Skull we got.

1208
01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.605
He's going to help us with the project.

1209
01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:29.608
Get his ID and tell him
to show up Monday.

1210
01:03:31.153 --> 01:03:34.029
So. Matias? You going
back to BOPE or what?

1211
01:03:37.575 --> 01:03:38.992
Hey. boss...

1212
01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:41.911
No one got that shit
and they're already calling...

1213
01:03:42.205 --> 01:03:43.871
No one wants to show
these guns.

1214
01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:46.833
Poke Moleira coz this shit's
about to get hot.

1215
01:03:46.835 --> 01:03:49.585
I already talked to Moleira.
he thought it was you too.

1216
01:03:49.586 --> 01:03:52.004
He said to stay alert coz the
cops are pissed.

1217
01:03:55.384 --> 01:03:57.592
I joined this meeting
to say that the taps...

1218
01:03:57.594 --> 01:04:00.095
proved that the dealers
didn't know shit...

1219
01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:00.881
about stolen arms.

1220
01:04:00.883 --> 01:04:03.056
- Secretary. good afternoon.
- I know what to do.

1221
01:04:03.058 --> 01:04:04.224
- Sorry I'm late.
- Nascimento.

1222
01:04:04.225 --> 01:04:06.642
But when I came in.
I couldn't utter a word.

1223
01:04:13.776 --> 01:04:15.860
I was reviewing the intel.

1224
01:04:17.947 --> 01:04:20.072
Secretary. our opinion remains
the same...

1225
01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:22.407
there is no reason
to justify an invasion.

1226
01:04:22.576 --> 01:04:25.535
Sub-secretary. the Governor
gave the order to invade.

1227
01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:29.164
And we have reliable info
from Colonel Fabio's informant...

1228
01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:30.623
- Right. Colonel?
- Affirmative.

1229
01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:32.083
That the arms are there.

1230
01:04:33.045 --> 01:04:34.627
Plus I think the dealers...

1231
01:04:34.628 --> 01:04:36.086
are deceiving you on the phone.

1232
01:04:36.464 --> 01:04:38.213
Secretary. excuse me.
with all due respect...

1233
01:04:38.215 --> 01:04:40.924
but I have 300 hours
of phone recordings here.

1234
01:04:42.636 --> 01:04:45.888
That's 300 hours of recording
against the word of one informant...

1235
01:04:46.432 --> 01:04:48.098
that only Colonel Fabio knows.

1236
01:04:48.099 --> 01:04:50.975
Secretary. with all due respect.
my informant is reliable.

1237
01:04:50.977 --> 01:04:54.145
Colonel. can you tell us
the name of your informant?

1238
01:04:54.147 --> 01:04:55.897
- Nascimento!
- My informant is reliable.

1239
01:04:55.899 --> 01:04:56.981
Can you tell us...

1240
01:04:56.983 --> 01:04:58.691
- who your informant is.
- Nascimento!

1241
01:04:59.152 --> 01:05:01.903
This operation is wrong.
Formoso.

1242
01:05:01.905 --> 01:05:04.655
The arms aren't there.
This operation is wrong.

1243
01:05:04.865 --> 01:05:07.491
Secretary. if the intel is correct...

1244
01:05:07.493 --> 01:05:09.117
then there's no reason to invade.

1245
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.917
Let me consult with the Governor.
just a minute.

1246
01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.629
Telephone for Dr. Guaracy.

1247
01:05:23.925 --> 01:05:25.132
Come in.

1248
01:05:26.094 --> 01:05:27.843
- Telephone. sir.
- Thank you.

1249
01:05:29.138 --> 01:05:30.596
Hello?

1250
01:05:32.933 --> 01:05:35.016
Formoso. I won't
speak to the Governor.

1251
01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.977
He's for invasion. Invade
that shit and pronto.

1252
01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:40.146
Right.

1253
01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:42.941
The Governor ordered us
to proceed.

1254
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:45.443
We're invading.
Excuse me.

1255
01:05:46.488 --> 01:05:47.737
Excuse me.

1256
01:05:48.155 --> 01:05:49.655
Valmir. take this to the car
for me.

1257
01:05:49.657 --> 01:05:51.532
Can I speak to you for a minute?

1258
01:05:56.564 --> 01:05:57.788
- What. sir?
- I want to know...

1259
01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:59.706
how you got back into BOPE.

1260
01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:02.418
If you don't know...

1261
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.420
then. clearly. it wasn't
you who helped me. sir.

1262
01:06:08.174 --> 01:06:10.049
Permission to leave?

1263
01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.391
Permission granted. Andre.

1264
01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:24.479
The cops in Tanque were
so corrupt that not even I...

1265
01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.731
could get rid of the thugs there.

1266
01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:29.025
To take Tanque. only a massive
operation would do.

1267
01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.068
Check out those guys.

1268
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.695
But the Governor didn't want that.

1269
01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:34.196
In an election year. there
could be no dead bystanders.

1270
01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:37.533
And that's when Matias
had a genius idea...

1271
01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.201
but dangerous as hell.

1272
01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:42.913
He entered Tanque in broad
daylight and rolled in slowly...

1273
01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:44.748
right in front of the thugs.

1274
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.459
Zero One. check that guy. there.

1275
01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.792
Hey. what's up.

1276
01:06:48.753 --> 01:06:50.211
There were guns everywhere.

1277
01:06:50.505 --> 01:06:53.923
If anyone suspected a thing.
Matias was fucked.

1278
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.553
But Matias was disguised as
a dirty cop...

1279
01:06:58.555 --> 01:07:00.972
and the thugs thought
they were among friends.

1280
01:07:02.516 --> 01:07:03.765
- All good. partner?
- All good.

1281
01:07:04.226 --> 01:07:05.392
You can go.

1282
01:07:05.394 --> 01:07:06.977
OK. thanks. Good job. guys.

1283
01:07:06.979 --> 01:07:07.978
Quiet?

1284
01:07:11.233 --> 01:07:14.234
Bocao. Moraes. do the rounds
below for me?

1285
01:07:14.236 --> 01:07:15.527
Going.

1286
01:07:16.446 --> 01:07:18.196
The team spent the night
in the outpost...

1287
01:07:18.531 --> 01:07:21.407
at a strategic point in the slum
waiting for daybreak.

1288
01:07:21.868 --> 01:07:23.618
Waiting for us to invade.

1289
01:08:01.738 --> 01:08:03.071
Shoot them!

1290
01:08:05.075 --> 01:08:06.616
Go. go. go!

1291
01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:39.480
Go. go. goddamn it!

1292
01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:41.649
Whenever we tried
to invade Tanque...

1293
01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.693
Felpa's gang escaped
the same way.

1294
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:45.945
The MP's would land...

1295
01:08:48.031 --> 01:08:49.739
the thugs would jet.

1296
01:08:51.702 --> 01:08:53.535
Go! Hurry the fuck up!

1297
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:57.789
The armoured car followed
as far as possible.

1298
01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:02.668
When the convoy hit
Felpa's alleys. he resisted.

1299
01:09:05.673 --> 01:09:08.924
He held everyone up until
his posse spilled toward the outpost.

1300
01:09:09.552 --> 01:09:12.177
The MP's there wouldn't
even see the punks pass.

1301
01:09:12.179 --> 01:09:14.471
It was a game with marked cards.

1302
01:09:16.057 --> 01:09:17.682
But that day. my friend...

1303
01:09:17.684 --> 01:09:20.435
it wasn't the paid-off MP's
that were at the outpost.

1304
01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.395
It was the Skulls.

1305
01:09:26.735 --> 01:09:28.151
- Going for it. Zero One.
- Wait.

1306
01:09:28.153 --> 01:09:30.528
- Going for it.
- Wait.

1307
01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:31.903
Fire!

1308
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:40.537
Die. you fucks!

1309
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:43.624
- Go. go!
- Die.

1310
01:09:48.004 --> 01:09:49.879
Go. let's go.
Let's go!

1311
01:09:55.553 --> 01:09:58.387
Attention. Bocao!
Let's check the weapons.

1312
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.182
One by one the dealers
of Tanque would die.

1313
01:10:02.768 --> 01:10:05.185
The whole West Side would be
in the hands of Rocha...

1314
01:10:05.771 --> 01:10:07.812
and join the constituency
of the administration.

1315
01:10:09.024 --> 01:10:11.191
Zero One. I think that's all.
Call the Colonel?

1316
01:10:13.153 --> 01:10:15.445
- Call him.
- Show the weapons. Bocao!

1317
01:10:15.446 --> 01:10:18.197
Ask him to show the weapons.
Valmir.

1318
01:10:21.786 --> 01:10:23.535
Hey. Zero One. show them.

1319
01:10:25.831 --> 01:10:27.665
- Hey. Azevedo?
- Those aren't the arms.

1320
01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:29.583
Those aren't from the station.

1321
01:10:29.584 --> 01:10:31.709
- Are you recording this. Valmir?
- Yes. sir.

1322
01:10:33.004 --> 01:10:34.962
You know what this operation
should be called?

1323
01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.382
- No. sir.
- Operation Iraq.

1324
01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:42.679
The strategy of the system
was well thought-out.

1325
01:10:43.889 --> 01:10:45.806
The drug lord of Tanque
could even escape...

1326
01:10:46.392 --> 01:10:48.642
but he'd never have
the courage to return.

1327
01:10:57.069 --> 01:10:58.985
Check the punk there.
The punk! Felpa.

1328
01:10:58.986 --> 01:10:59.985
It's Felpa.

1329
01:10:59.987 --> 01:11:01.821
Let BOPE take him out. Fabio.

1330
01:11:02.907 --> 01:11:04.699
- Tatui! Bocao!
- What?

1331
01:11:04.826 --> 01:11:06.450
- There!
- Where'd he go. Zero One?

1332
01:11:06.452 --> 01:11:07.910
- There. in the alley.
- There.

1333
01:11:08.037 --> 01:11:10.371
Didn't I tell you BOPE
would go get him. There.

1334
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.790
Move! Fucking move!

1335
01:11:21.717 --> 01:11:22.757
Give up!

1336
01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:26.010
I give up. I give up. fuck!

1337
01:11:26.513 --> 01:11:27.887
Just one problem.

1338
01:11:28.222 --> 01:11:31.390
Rocha called for Matias
to work with him.

1339
01:11:31.392 --> 01:11:32.599
- I surrender.
- Tie him up. Bocao.

1340
01:11:32.601 --> 01:11:34.893
And I'm the one who trained
Matias. my friend.

1341
01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:37.980
He wouldn't stop until
he had found those arms.

1342
01:11:38.441 --> 01:11:39.736
It wouldn't be pretty.

1343
01:11:39.738 --> 01:11:40.816
You're the boss?

1344
01:11:41.193 --> 01:11:42.609
I am.

1345
01:11:43.486 --> 01:11:45.403
So here's what you'll do...

1346
01:11:46.197 --> 01:11:50.450
you'll tell me now where
the police weapons are.

1347
01:11:50.869 --> 01:11:51.909
What police weapons?

1348
01:11:51.911 --> 01:11:53.411
Dunno shit about no weapons. man.

1349
01:11:53.413 --> 01:11:55.455
- You don't. huh?
- Dunno shit about no weapons.

1350
01:11:55.457 --> 01:11:57.039
- Where are the guns?
- Dunno about guns.

1351
01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.708
- I'm telling you!
- Where are the guns?

1352
01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.668
What guns? I dunno!
Let's work it out...

1353
01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:03.545
- I dunno about no guns!
- Listen. punk.

1354
01:12:04.089 --> 01:12:05.922
This ain't a negotiation.

1355
01:12:06.467 --> 01:12:08.633
I want to know where
the fuck those guns are!

1356
01:12:08.635 --> 01:12:10.886
- I dunno about no fucking guns!
- Talk!

1357
01:12:10.888 --> 01:12:12.554
- I dunno
- Talk. you fuck.

1358
01:12:12.555 --> 01:12:14.472
- Fucking talk.
- I don't fucking know.

1359
01:12:14.474 --> 01:12:15.598
I don't fucking know!

1360
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.849
Let's work him over. Zero One.

1361
01:12:16.851 --> 01:12:18.017
Put him in the bag.

1362
01:12:22.064 --> 01:12:24.023
Fuck. this is taking forever.

1363
01:12:24.442 --> 01:12:25.691
Let's check this shit out.

1364
01:12:25.693 --> 01:12:27.067
Come on. Nunes.
Marreco. come.

1365
01:12:27.068 --> 01:12:28.588
- Check it out?
- Take over. Goncalves.

1366
01:12:28.987 --> 01:12:30.028
Let's go.

1367
01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.448
He's fucked up. Zero One.

1368
01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:33.865
He doesn't know anything.

1369
01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:36.910
Look at me. cocksucker.

1370
01:12:36.912 --> 01:12:38.077
You're gonna tell me...

1371
01:12:38.079 --> 01:12:40.622
where the police weapons are
right now. got it?

1372
01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:42.582
- I don't got 'em.
- You don't got 'em. huh?

1373
01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.459
You got 'em. Tell me now
where they are!

1374
01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:46.919
Talk. motherfucker.

1375
01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:49.004
I don't got 'em. I don't...

1376
01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.089
- You don't want to cooperate?
- I already told you...

1377
01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:52.932
- Don't want to cooperate?
- I don't got 'em...

1378
01:12:53.427 --> 01:12:55.469
Put him in the bag again.
Bocao.

1379
01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.476
What the fuck. Rocha?

1380
01:13:04.604 --> 01:13:05.645
Are you fucking nuts?

1381
01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.980
He was the boss!
He was gonna give me the arms!

1382
01:13:07.982 --> 01:13:10.483
Well done. Excellent work by
BOPE. Captain.

1383
01:13:10.485 --> 01:13:11.943
That's who we were after.

1384
01:13:11.944 --> 01:13:13.443
Right. Commander?

1385
01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:16.488
- What's going on. Fabio?
- Sad for the thug. Matias?

1386
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:19.616
Bocao! Tatui! Take the boss down...

1387
01:13:19.618 --> 01:13:21.952
so I can have a little chat
with Fabio.

1388
01:13:25.582 --> 01:13:27.874
What the fuck. Colonel?
What's going on?

1389
01:13:28.417 --> 01:13:30.668
I smell bullshit.

1390
01:13:31.754 --> 01:13:34.755
- Who's the informant?
- I'll find out and let you know.

1391
01:13:34.757 --> 01:13:36.549
Who's X9?

1392
01:13:38.386 --> 01:13:41.512
Here's what you'll do.
you'll call me...

1393
01:13:41.513 --> 01:13:44.806
later. you'll give me
the name and number of X9.

1394
01:13:45.016 --> 01:13:47.934
And I want this today!

1395
01:13:49.896 --> 01:13:51.771
Understood. Major?

1396
01:14:00.698 --> 01:14:03.782
Stop! What the fuck. Russo?

1397
01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:07.035
What the fuck. Marreco?
What the fuck?

1398
01:14:08.747 --> 01:14:09.955
You fucking killed him!

1399
01:14:09.957 --> 01:14:11.790
Fuck. didn't you want
him out of the way?

1400
01:14:11.791 --> 01:14:13.499
He's out of the way.
What you want?

1401
01:14:13.501 --> 01:14:15.501
You're gonna light a candle
for this fucking Skull?

1402
01:14:16.045 --> 01:14:18.546
Marreco. mark 15 minutes...

1403
01:14:19.048 --> 01:14:20.923
inform the superior of this shit...

1404
01:14:20.925 --> 01:14:23.009
say the bullet came from
who the fuck knows.

1405
01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.928
And say that me and
Commander Fabio...

1406
01:14:26.597 --> 01:14:28.471
were not on location.

1407
01:14:28.473 --> 01:14:29.723
Right. Fabio?

1408
01:14:31.393 --> 01:14:32.726
Let's go. Fabio.

1409
01:14:32.728 --> 01:14:35.812
Let's get the fuck out.

1410
01:14:38.984 --> 01:14:40.483
Let's go. Fabio!

1411
01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:21.605
You won't investigate
his death. Secretary?

1412
01:15:21.607 --> 01:15:23.148
We're waiting on
Ballistics. Colonel.

1413
01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:24.816
The ballistics are this.
Formoso:...

1414
01:15:24.817 --> 01:15:26.525
Andre died from a bullet
in the back...

1415
01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:29.070
far from his squad.
and the arms weren't there.

1416
01:15:29.447 --> 01:15:30.927
Nascimento. I understand your pain...

1417
01:15:31.407 --> 01:15:32.990
I know this is difficult...

1418
01:15:32.992 --> 01:15:35.534
but you must understand
the public supported the operation.

1419
01:15:35.536 --> 01:15:37.787
11 dealers dead and
15 weapons seized.

1420
01:15:37.789 --> 01:15:39.622
Major Matias was a casualty.

1421
01:15:39.623 --> 01:15:40.664
Could have been anyone.

1422
01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:42.123
Matias wasn't just anyone.

1423
01:15:56.889 --> 01:15:58.889
Salute.

1424
01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:06.647
Fire!

1425
01:16:07.483 --> 01:16:08.983
Attention!

1426
01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:43.055
Colonel Fabio? Can I speak
with you for a minute?

1427
01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:47.685
Colonel. A terrible loss
to our organization.

1428
01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:50.563
My condolences.
Excuse me.

1429
01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:55.358
I will investigate his death.

1430
01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:58.945
And I will find out what
happened to Andre. Fabio.

1431
01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:02.157
If you know something.
you'd better tell me now.

1432
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.162
Nascimento. Andre was
also my friend.

1433
01:17:07.955 --> 01:17:10.539
And I believe in my men.

1434
01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:14.710
If you find out anything.
let me know.

1435
01:17:21.052 --> 01:17:22.509
This is gonna go to shit.

1436
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:24.594
- Go to shit. why?
- Because it will.

1437
01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:25.595
What did you want me to do?

1438
01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:26.804
The guy gets in my face...

1439
01:17:26.806 --> 01:17:28.139
- and I sit there?
- So what?

1440
01:17:28.141 --> 01:17:29.348
And Nascimento's on my ass.

1441
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:30.558
- Who's on your ass.
- Nascimento!

1442
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.809
Fuck Nascimento.

1443
01:17:32.395 --> 01:17:34.520
- Kojak. coffee. please.
- Water for me.

1444
01:17:34.522 --> 01:17:36.429
- Hey. Nunes?
- Major. Commander.

1445
01:17:36.431 --> 01:17:37.565
Listen. buddy.

1446
01:17:37.733 --> 01:17:39.983
Nascimento doesn't have
anything on us.

1447
01:17:40.694 --> 01:17:42.069
And another thing. partner.

1448
01:17:42.071 --> 01:17:43.737
If I'm in deep shit.
you're in deep shit.

1449
01:17:43.739 --> 01:17:44.780
You should remember that.

1450
01:17:44.782 --> 01:17:46.990
And you should know that
now everything's 50-50.

1451
01:17:46.992 --> 01:17:48.408
50-50. no fucking way. Fabio.

1452
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.702
Fucking way.
The "I know" tax. Rocha.

1453
01:17:51.038 --> 01:17:52.037
The what tax?

1454
01:17:52.039 --> 01:17:53.955
Are you out of your mind?
You forgot?

1455
01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.123
If you wanna giggle.
you gotta tickle.

1456
01:17:57.752 --> 01:18:00.086
Motherfucker.
Kojak. hold that shit.

1457
01:18:00.088 --> 01:18:02.379
- I'm off. Nunes.
- It's all on his tab now. Kojak.

1458
01:18:02.381 --> 01:18:04.757
- OK. commander.
- Nunes. how's everything?

1459
01:18:05.093 --> 01:18:07.176
Like an ocean. boss.
Salty. ain't it?

1460
01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:10.345
Took me a long time to realize
my work in the government...

1461
01:18:10.347 --> 01:18:12.597
had nothing to do with
public security.

1462
01:18:12.641 --> 01:18:15.433
Valmir. we're not going to
renew the requests...

1463
01:18:15.435 --> 01:18:17.977
for the wiretaps of the
operation in the Tanque.

1464
01:18:18.188 --> 01:18:19.854
Excuse me.
Colonel Nascimento said...

1465
01:18:19.856 --> 01:18:21.147
That's all. Valmir. Thank you.

1466
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:23.483
It was all a strategy to get votes.

1467
01:18:23.818 --> 01:18:26.985
To them. Matias' death
meant nothing.

1468
01:18:27.655 --> 01:18:30.155
In the media. the operation
had been a success.

1469
01:18:30.991 --> 01:18:32.741
That was all that mattered.

1470
01:18:33.786 --> 01:18:35.452
You called Rafa?

1471
01:18:39.499 --> 01:18:42.083
- No.
- What is it. Beto?

1472
01:18:45.839 --> 01:18:48.881
- What happened?
- They killed Andre.

1473
01:18:50.051 --> 01:18:53.427
I heard.
Are you taking care of yourself?

1474
01:18:55.472 --> 01:18:57.681
I don't know what's happening.

1475
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:01.351
I'm going to find out.

1476
01:19:06.065 --> 01:19:08.899
We haven't been talking...

1477
01:19:10.069 --> 01:19:11.735
for some time.

1478
01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:16.115
- Beto...
- He was right.

1479
01:19:17.952 --> 01:19:21.620
- Andre was right.
- Beto. I want to know about Rafa.

1480
01:19:22.497 --> 01:19:24.539
I'm sorry about Andre...

1481
01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:27.000
but I want you to call your son.

1482
01:19:28.879 --> 01:19:31.671
You're alienating yourself.
Beto.

1483
01:19:32.883 --> 01:19:35.049
Don't do this to your son.

1484
01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:37.843
He was only protecting
his friend.

1485
01:19:38.012 --> 01:19:39.845
You should be proud.

1486
01:19:40.931 --> 01:19:42.556
Don't waste time...

1487
01:19:42.558 --> 01:19:44.850
don't wait for him to
want to talk to you.

1488
01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:47.519
Call Rafa to have a chat.

1489
01:20:15.881 --> 01:20:18.381
You're gonna trade your
neck for your arm?

1490
01:20:28.142 --> 01:20:29.683
Breathe.

1491
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:31.685
Relax.

1492
01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.692
Breathe.

1493
01:20:48.787 --> 01:20:51.955
Come. Come. Mount.
Get on.

1494
01:21:04.592 --> 01:21:05.800
Son!

1495
01:21:15.812 --> 01:21:18.562
You think I believed
that weed was yours?

1496
01:21:27.823 --> 01:21:29.990
Julia must be pretty hot
for you to take the rap...

1497
01:21:29.992 --> 01:21:32.575
for 100 grams of weed
right in front of me. huh?

1498
01:21:35.413 --> 01:21:37.121
I'm not afraid of you.

1499
01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:44.461
I don't want you to be
afraid of me.

1500
01:21:49.467 --> 01:21:51.968
I want you to know
that I'm your father.

1501
01:21:53.471 --> 01:21:54.804
I know.

1502
01:21:58.435 --> 01:22:00.143
- Do you?
- I do.

1503
01:22:07.443 --> 01:22:09.943
- You really know?
- I know.

1504
01:22:13.866 --> 01:22:16.033
Wow. I'll even let you grab
my arm again.

1505
01:22:16.035 --> 01:22:17.826
Grab it.

1506
01:22:18.828 --> 01:22:20.786
You only grab it when I let you.

1507
01:22:21.831 --> 01:22:22.997
Wait. wait.

1508
01:22:32.884 --> 01:22:34.467
Yes. Valmir.

1509
01:22:38.055 --> 01:22:40.472
I know... You know why
this will go on. Valmir?

1510
01:22:41.516 --> 01:22:43.475
You know why this will go on?

1511
01:22:43.477 --> 01:22:45.727
Because what they want
are votes. Valmir.

1512
01:22:46.646 --> 01:22:48.813
I don't want votes. I want
to know who killed Andre.

1513
01:22:55.321 --> 01:22:57.071
I appreciate it. then.

1514
01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:00.699
I'm with my son.
we'll talk later. ok?

1515
01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:05.829
OK. Thanks.
Thank you.

1516
01:23:07.332 --> 01:23:09.332
Your friend died in the operation?

1517
01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.752
Something to do with the militia
that stole the guns?

1518
01:23:16.049 --> 01:23:17.465
Who told you this?

1519
01:23:19.051 --> 01:23:21.468
I bet a year's salary that
it was the militia...

1520
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:23.428
who stole the guns and
will invade the slum...

1521
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:26.390
I'll accept it. but only
as an investigative report.

1522
01:23:26.558 --> 01:23:27.641
Investigative?

1523
01:23:27.643 --> 01:23:28.725
- More than...
- I need deeper.

1524
01:23:28.727 --> 01:23:30.936
I need documents.
photos. statements.

1525
01:23:30.938 --> 01:23:33.021
Infiltrate. Disguise yourself.
Figure it out.

1526
01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:36.565
Camelo. wait.
Give me the cover then.

1527
01:23:36.859 --> 01:23:38.609
Bring me the goods. all right?

1528
01:23:39.779 --> 01:23:41.445
You'll give me the cover?

1529
01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.701
Tap the land-line now.
Today.

1530
01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.537
The mobile. put it on
account of some probe.

1531
01:23:50.539 --> 01:23:52.122
I want to hear everything
Fraga says...

1532
01:23:52.124 --> 01:23:53.706
- to this journalist. got it?
- Colonel...

1533
01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:56.000
- he's a representative.
- I take full responsibility.

1534
01:23:58.588 --> 01:23:59.629
What time do you get off?

1535
01:23:59.631 --> 01:24:01.965
Hey partner. can't hear you
well. Still hissing.

1536
01:24:02.716 --> 01:24:04.341
I'll check the signal.

1537
01:24:09.348 --> 01:24:11.723
- OK.
- Beautiful.

1538
01:24:12.726 --> 01:24:15.060
Preparing to record.

1539
01:24:16.021 --> 01:24:17.354
Recording.

1540
01:24:19.983 --> 01:24:21.607
If it were up to Rocha...

1541
01:24:21.609 --> 01:24:23.818
the militia would enter
Tanque real slow.

1542
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:25.695
No one would even notice.

1543
01:24:26.823 --> 01:24:28.948
Look here. Clara. here.

1544
01:24:29.617 --> 01:24:31.993
You see the scratch there?
You see?

1545
01:24:31.994 --> 01:24:33.660
- Where? The white bit?
- That's it.

1546
01:24:33.662 --> 01:24:34.744
What about it?

1547
01:24:34.746 --> 01:24:36.621
I think it's the coat-of-arms
of the police.

1548
01:24:36.623 --> 01:24:38.707
They scratched it out
to disguise themselves.

1549
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:41.001
But the election was coming up.

1550
01:24:41.003 --> 01:24:42.085
They were pushing...

1551
01:24:42.087 --> 01:24:44.754
and Rocha set up camp
in the house of a widow.

1552
01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:47.132
- I have to go in somehow.
- Easy. easy. easy.

1553
01:24:47.133 --> 01:24:48.549
- I have to go in.
- Easy!

1554
01:24:48.676 --> 01:24:50.009
And gas?

1555
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:52.636
Gas got us 8.600.

1556
01:24:53.431 --> 01:24:56.932
This here keeps sadness at bay.
A beautiful thing. my friend.

1557
01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.018
As soon as the media
forgot Tanque...

1558
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.479
the militia would probably
microwave her.

1559
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.563
Mrs. Olga. first month
in advance.

1560
01:25:03.815 --> 01:25:06.566
Her house would become HQ
for the police patrol...

1561
01:25:06.776 --> 01:25:09.027
and Rocha would
terrorize the slum.

1562
01:25:09.029 --> 01:25:10.403
An almost perfect plan.

1563
01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:11.779
Look.
I think they're leaving.

1564
01:25:11.781 --> 01:25:13.615
Easy. easy. Clara.
Easy. Clara.

1565
01:25:13.617 --> 01:25:14.824
Forget easy. Let's go!

1566
01:25:15.327 --> 01:25:17.035
Hide the camera.
Come on.

1567
01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:19.786
The photos were already enough
for the cover.

1568
01:25:19.788 --> 01:25:21.663
Say that we're a couple
looking for a rental.

1569
01:25:21.665 --> 01:25:23.749
But journalists. my friend.
are curious.

1570
01:25:24.001 --> 01:25:26.376
Clara wouldn't rest until
she discovered...

1571
01:25:26.378 --> 01:25:28.003
what was in that house.

1572
01:25:28.005 --> 01:25:29.421
How's this thing here?

1573
01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:32.673
Twenty. Aranha. have a ball.

1574
01:25:32.675 --> 01:25:34.300
Keep an eye out.
they're fuckers.

1575
01:25:34.302 --> 01:25:35.760
When they get more.
it's fucked...

1576
01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:37.136
- Hey. godfather.
- Fucking around?

1577
01:25:37.138 --> 01:25:39.055
- We did the collection.
- Goddamn it.

1578
01:25:39.057 --> 01:25:41.432
I told you not to walk around
with these guns in Tanque.

1579
01:25:41.434 --> 01:25:42.767
We went quickly and came back.

1580
01:25:42.769 --> 01:25:45.102
- Who stayed at at the base?
- Who's at the base?

1581
01:25:45.522 --> 01:25:47.438
- No one.
- No fucking one?

1582
01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:48.688
Didn't I tell you to call...

1583
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.357
Are you fucking kidding me?

1584
01:25:50.359 --> 01:25:52.609
Shit. Nunes. 20 years
in this shit. huh.

1585
01:25:52.611 --> 01:25:55.111
Like I told you.
the price is 700.

1586
01:25:55.113 --> 01:25:56.530
OK. deal.

1587
01:25:56.532 --> 01:25:58.823
When a journalist smells a scoop.
get out the way.

1588
01:25:58.825 --> 01:26:00.075
It's a bit messy...

1589
01:26:00.077 --> 01:26:03.036
but take a look.
and I'll be back. ok?

1590
01:26:03.037 --> 01:26:04.574
- OK. thank you.
- It's great.

1591
01:26:04.575 --> 01:26:06.330
Clara sweet-talked the widow...

1592
01:26:06.332 --> 01:26:09.083
promised her the world and
the widow was as high as a kite.

1593
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:12.586
Hello. Hi. Mrs. Olga. yes?

1594
01:26:13.589 --> 01:26:16.340
No. I'm not gonna pay more
than what we agreed.

1595
01:26:17.092 --> 01:26:18.675
What couple. Mrs. Olga?!

1596
01:26:19.594 --> 01:26:20.906
That's how people are...

1597
01:26:20.908 --> 01:26:21.344
Clara...

1598
01:26:21.346 --> 01:26:23.096
they only care about themselves.

1599
01:26:29.396 --> 01:26:31.020
Check this out.

1600
01:26:34.483 --> 01:26:35.941
- Whoa.
- Hello.

1601
01:26:36.151 --> 01:26:37.693
Get the camera.

1602
01:26:40.322 --> 01:26:43.031
Fraga. it's Clara. Fraga.
I'm in the Tanque neighbourhood.

1603
01:26:43.033 --> 01:26:44.074
Doing what. Clara?

1604
01:26:44.076 --> 01:26:46.493
I found the guys who stole
the guns from the station.

1605
01:26:46.494 --> 01:26:48.536
Now I'm certain
it was the militia.

1606
01:26:48.705 --> 01:26:51.497
Clara. listen to me.
Get out now. Clara.

1607
01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:53.457
These people are very dangerous.

1608
01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:54.792
No. it's ok.
It's all ok.

1609
01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:57.920
No. I went in the house.
You won't believe this.

1610
01:26:57.922 --> 01:26:59.922
I found the Governor's
campaign materials.

1611
01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:02.424
There's posters. banners.
everything.

1612
01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:04.509
No. it's full of
photos of the Governor

1613
01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:05.927
with Fortunato and Guaracy.

1614
01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:07.679
Clara. who are you with?
Are you alone?

1615
01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:08.930
Calm down...

1616
01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.519
Who's on the phone. bitch?

1617
01:27:15.062 --> 01:27:17.313
- Give me that.
- Take it easy.

1618
01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.356
- What are you doing here?
- Take it easy...

1619
01:27:19.358 --> 01:27:21.108
- Clara? Can you hear me?
- Take it easy...

1620
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.651
Hello? Clara?

1621
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:25.529
- What's wrong?
- Where are the car keys?

1622
01:27:25.656 --> 01:27:28.532
- What happened?
- The militia's got Clara.

1623
01:27:28.534 --> 01:27:30.492
There's at least 20 years
of jail for us here.

1624
01:27:30.493 --> 01:27:32.994
- Oh yeah? You're X9? You're what?
- No.

1625
01:27:33.747 --> 01:27:35.913
You scared? You scared?

1626
01:27:35.915 --> 01:27:37.707
Motherfucker.
You scared?

1627
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:39.125
Stop it!

1628
01:27:39.544 --> 01:27:41.669
Take this bitch to
the living room.

1629
01:27:41.671 --> 01:27:43.171
- Get the fuck up.
- Give me the keys.

1630
01:27:43.173 --> 01:27:44.839
Let the police take care of it...

1631
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.548
The police are exactly
the problem.

1632
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:47.674
Honey. give me the keys.

1633
01:27:48.344 --> 01:27:49.468
Call me then. please.

1634
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:51.303
Diogo. for God's sake. Diogo!

1635
01:27:52.723 --> 01:27:55.974
Rep. Fraga.
Who else knows you're here?

1636
01:28:02.482 --> 01:28:04.523
You want to get a beating then?

1637
01:28:05.568 --> 01:28:07.818
Don't do that. boss.
She's fine.

1638
01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:09.528
Let me play with her first.

1639
01:28:12.408 --> 01:28:14.742
Finish with her. then. and
then clean up the mess.

1640
01:28:15.952 --> 01:28:17.160
No!

1641
01:28:17.454 --> 01:28:18.495
- Take off your clothes.
- No.

1642
01:28:18.497 --> 01:28:19.977
- Take off your fucking clothes.
- No!

1643
01:28:24.961 --> 01:28:26.127
Chief.

1644
01:28:27.756 --> 01:28:30.840
Nothing? Well. Representative.
that's it.

1645
01:28:31.926 --> 01:28:33.967
Without evidence it's hard.
you know?

1646
01:28:35.346 --> 01:28:36.804
No witnesses. nothing.

1647
01:28:37.598 --> 01:28:41.350
Look. if we find a body.
any clue...

1648
01:28:41.352 --> 01:28:43.352
you'll be the first
to know. ok?

1649
01:28:45.605 --> 01:28:47.563
She was telling me
on the phone...

1650
01:28:47.565 --> 01:28:50.483
she had found the stolen weapons.
before she was interrupted.

1651
01:28:50.485 --> 01:28:52.819
Obviously. she was surprised
by those guys.

1652
01:28:52.821 --> 01:28:54.612
You have to publish this. Camelo.

1653
01:28:54.614 --> 01:28:56.406
I've got nothing to publish.
I have no proof.

1654
01:28:56.408 --> 01:28:57.615
Proof. Camelo?!

1655
01:28:57.617 --> 01:28:59.951
The government is our partner.
My hands are tied.

1656
01:28:59.952 --> 01:29:02.411
What you have on your hands
is a missing employee.

1657
01:29:02.579 --> 01:29:05.664
Obviously. the militia killed Clara
and ditched her body.

1658
01:29:05.666 --> 01:29:06.832
What body. Fraga?

1659
01:29:08.335 --> 01:29:09.960
She was working for your paper.

1660
01:29:09.962 --> 01:29:11.837
All this came with the job.

1661
01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:17.883
To be or not to be.
that is the question. partner.

1662
01:29:19.011 --> 01:29:21.887
What would be more noble
for the militia?

1663
01:29:22.098 --> 01:29:25.558
Kill the vermin that
enter our lives...

1664
01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:29.019
or live to enjoy the
buzz of a beer?

1665
01:29:29.062 --> 01:29:30.395
Tell me. Goncalves.

1666
01:29:30.647 --> 01:29:31.938
Enough with the bullshit!

1667
01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.314
You're quoting the bible. now?

1668
01:29:33.316 --> 01:29:36.484
Bible? It's a novella.
you dumbfuck.

1669
01:29:37.779 --> 01:29:40.321
- Hurry. Pull those teeth out.
- This shit stinks.

1670
01:29:40.449 --> 01:29:43.491
But are you sure the
journalist called Fraga?

1671
01:29:44.618 --> 01:29:46.910
Guaracy. there's a 3-minute
call here.

1672
01:29:47.329 --> 01:29:48.662
You think for a bedtime story?

1673
01:29:48.664 --> 01:29:49.830
She opened her trap.

1674
01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:53.876
Goddamn it. This is very
serious. huh. Representative.

1675
01:29:54.587 --> 01:29:56.336
What are we gonna do?

1676
01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:59.839
"We"?
What are YOU gonna do?

1677
01:29:59.924 --> 01:30:01.924
Fraga is your problem.

1678
01:30:03.887 --> 01:30:07.889
Representative. easy.
Fraga is our problem.

1679
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.641
And we take care of
our problems.

1680
01:30:11.352 --> 01:30:12.894
Farewell. Guaracy.

1681
01:30:13.312 --> 01:30:15.604
I found the guys who stole
the arms from the station.

1682
01:30:15.606 --> 01:30:17.689
Now I'm certain
it was the militia.

1683
01:30:17.691 --> 01:30:19.608
Clara. listen to me.
Get out now. Clara.

1684
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.026
These people are very dangerous.

1685
01:30:21.028 --> 01:30:22.068
You won't believe this.

1686
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:24.070
I found the Governor's
campaign committee.

1687
01:30:24.072 --> 01:30:26.490
There's posters. banners.
everything.

1688
01:30:26.492 --> 01:30:28.700
No. it's full of
photos of the Governor

1689
01:30:28.701 --> 01:30:29.867
with Fortunato and Guaracy.

1690
01:30:29.869 --> 01:30:31.535
Clara. who are you with?
Are you alone?

1691
01:30:32.789 --> 01:30:33.996
Who's on the phone. bitch?

1692
01:30:33.998 --> 01:30:36.332
- Hello? Clara?
- Give me that.

1693
01:30:36.334 --> 01:30:38.459
Play the end. Valmir. just the end.

1694
01:30:40.546 --> 01:30:41.629
You won't believe this.

1695
01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:43.630
I found the Governor's
campaign committee.

1696
01:30:43.632 --> 01:30:45.882
There's posters. banners.
everything.

1697
01:30:45.967 --> 01:30:47.926
No. it's full of
photos of the Governor

1698
01:30:47.928 --> 01:30:49.469
with Fortunato and Guaracy.

1699
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:50.804
Clara. who are you with?
Are you alone?

1700
01:30:50.806 --> 01:30:52.472
- When was this. Valmir?
- 11 pm.

1701
01:30:52.849 --> 01:30:54.349
- Is it in the system?
- Not yet.

1702
01:30:54.351 --> 01:30:55.767
It's here. in my recorder.

1703
01:31:00.898 --> 01:31:03.106
It's like I got punched
in the face.

1704
01:31:03.943 --> 01:31:04.942
In one blow...

1705
01:31:04.944 --> 01:31:07.444
I had discovered
it wasn't just the militia...

1706
01:31:07.446 --> 01:31:09.071
that was behind the
arms robbery...

1707
01:31:09.073 --> 01:31:11.949
Clara's disappearance.
and Andre's murder.

1708
01:31:16.621 --> 01:31:18.955
The militia wouldn't
campaign for the Governor...

1709
01:31:18.957 --> 01:31:20.540
and Guaracy for free.

1710
01:31:20.834 --> 01:31:23.000
The hole went a lot deeper.

1711
01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:28.381
I was surrounded by enemies.
Real enemies.

1712
01:31:29.508 --> 01:31:32.384
The Secretariat of Security
was the core of the system.

1713
01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:35.387
Public security in the State
of Rio de Janeiro...

1714
01:31:35.806 --> 01:31:37.639
was in the hands of crooks.

1715
01:31:37.641 --> 01:31:39.141
And I could trust no one.

1716
01:31:39.143 --> 01:31:39.975
Nascimento.

1717
01:31:39.977 --> 01:31:41.685
Perfect. I'll deliver it.

1718
01:31:42.603 --> 01:31:44.520
The arms robbery
and Matias' death...

1719
01:31:44.522 --> 01:31:46.605
meant nothing for the system.

1720
01:31:48.401 --> 01:31:50.526
The system is ruled by politics...

1721
01:31:50.528 --> 01:31:52.570
and politics only respects the media.

1722
01:31:53.406 --> 01:31:56.365
Only this time. the militia
had killed a journalist.

1723
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.658
The system would have to catch up.

1724
01:31:59.703 --> 01:32:00.910
- Valmir.
- Secretary.

1725
01:32:01.538 --> 01:32:03.079
Valmir. tap this number for me.

1726
01:32:05.584 --> 01:32:07.542
This is the phone of Rep. Fraga?

1727
01:32:07.544 --> 01:32:09.002
Tap it.

1728
01:32:10.046 --> 01:32:12.589
- It was already intercepted.
- How's that?

1729
01:32:14.592 --> 01:32:16.466
Colonel Nascimento ordered
its interception.

1730
01:32:16.468 --> 01:32:17.843
Fine. give me a copy...

1731
01:32:17.845 --> 01:32:19.678
and you can delete the file.

1732
01:32:20.556 --> 01:32:21.972
He just took it with him.

1733
01:32:22.016 --> 01:32:24.600
The evidence had been microwaved.

1734
01:32:25.852 --> 01:32:28.644
There were no witnesses.
It was right in my face.

1735
01:32:28.813 --> 01:32:31.606
The system was going to kill Fraga.
And soon.

1736
01:32:31.608 --> 01:32:34.609
Fraga was next.

1737
01:32:39.532 --> 01:32:41.073
Goddamn it. Rosane.

1738
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:43.408
Rosane. it's Roberto again.

1739
01:32:43.410 --> 01:32:44.576
I'm on your street...

1740
01:32:44.578 --> 01:32:47.621
I'll wait for you at the
door of your building. ok?

1741
01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:49.539
When you get this message...

1742
01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:51.958
I'll be at your building door.
you'll find me there.

1743
01:32:56.631 --> 01:32:59.757
- Your dad called. Rafa?
- Why?

1744
01:33:00.009 --> 01:33:02.927
Nothing... just to know.

1745
01:33:11.061 --> 01:33:13.478
- Mom. there's Dad!
- Your Dad?

1746
01:33:30.537 --> 01:33:32.621
No! Stay in the car!
Rosana.

1747
01:33:34.083 --> 01:33:35.540
Rafa!

1748
01:33:37.002 --> 01:33:39.461
- Get in the car!
- Talk to me. Rafa!

1749
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:42.088
Drive! Drive!
Go! Go! Go!

1750
01:33:42.674 --> 01:33:44.340
Oh my god!

1751
01:33:44.842 --> 01:33:45.967
Go!

1752
01:33:59.356 --> 01:34:02.941
What did the doctor say?

1753
01:34:02.943 --> 01:34:05.652
The surgery will take
7 to 8 hours...

1754
01:34:06.029 --> 01:34:09.698
because he was shot
in the kidney.

1755
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:13.659
He said he will be...
he will...

1756
01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.687
- Beto...
- I'll be back. I'll be back.

1757
01:34:44.106 --> 01:34:45.605
Even by chance...

1758
01:34:45.733 --> 01:34:48.608
the system ends up hurting us
where it hurts most.

1759
01:34:49.945 --> 01:34:51.486
It's going to take 7 to 8 hours...

1760
01:34:51.488 --> 01:34:52.696
I spent my entire life...

1761
01:34:52.698 --> 01:34:54.990
believing that the police
could do the right thing.

1762
01:34:54.991 --> 01:34:56.282
It'll be fine.

1763
01:34:56.284 --> 01:34:59.076
One hour to the next. all
that conviction was gone.

1764
01:35:01.789 --> 01:35:03.622
I had no alternative.

1765
01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:06.000
I'd have to hit
the system head-on.

1766
01:35:06.586 --> 01:35:09.795
Doctor. there's a checkpoint
in front of your condo.

1767
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.506
How's that. Braddock?

1768
01:35:13.508 --> 01:35:15.300
There's a checkpoint
in front of your condo.

1769
01:35:15.302 --> 01:35:16.384
Can I stop. Doctor?

1770
01:35:16.386 --> 01:35:19.345
But. in Brazil. it's hard
to arrest authorities.

1771
01:35:19.347 --> 01:35:21.306
Pull over. so I can
straighten them out.

1772
01:35:21.308 --> 01:35:22.974
So a politician. forget it.

1773
01:35:23.267 --> 01:35:24.641
Stop the fucking car.

1774
01:35:24.643 --> 01:35:26.727
Imagine how fucked up it'd
be if BOPE worked over

1775
01:35:26.729 --> 01:35:28.979
a corrupt representative
just like a dealer.

1776
01:35:29.732 --> 01:35:31.065
Lower your weapon. son.

1777
01:35:31.067 --> 01:35:33.025
Who's in charge here?

1778
01:35:33.944 --> 01:35:34.943
I am.

1779
01:35:34.945 --> 01:35:37.446
Wait... What's this?
What's this?

1780
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:45.078
You motherfucker. Look at me.

1781
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.329
Look at me!

1782
01:35:46.748 --> 01:35:48.623
If anything happens
to my son...

1783
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.667
if anything happens to
anyone in my family...

1784
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:53.878
if my son dies.
I will kill everyone.

1785
01:35:53.879 --> 01:35:55.545
You understand?
Look at me!

1786
01:35:55.798 --> 01:35:59.800
And the first to die will
be you. you motherfucker.

1787
01:36:30.872 --> 01:36:32.288
Your honour.

1788
01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:33.790
You opened the CPI.
your honour?

1789
01:36:33.792 --> 01:36:34.999
- What's this?
- What's this?!

1790
01:36:35.001 --> 01:36:37.877
Have you read the paper?
Dead journalist. Fortunato!

1791
01:36:37.878 --> 01:36:39.670
- People die everyday!
- What a mess.

1792
01:36:39.672 --> 01:36:42.422
You subpoenaed Colonel
Roberto Nascimento!

1793
01:36:42.424 --> 01:36:44.424
- I did.
- A CPI during elections...

1794
01:36:44.426 --> 01:36:46.051
- helps this gentleman!
- Cynical.

1795
01:36:46.053 --> 01:36:47.302
You're a punk!

1796
01:36:47.304 --> 01:36:48.637
- Cynical.
- Calm down. Fortunato!

1797
01:36:48.639 --> 01:36:50.931
If there's a CPI.
I'll be the narrator!

1798
01:36:50.933 --> 01:36:52.432
Narrator. my ass!

1799
01:36:52.642 --> 01:36:56.269
In this CPI. Representative.
you're under investigation.

1800
01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:58.396
- Punk!
- You're the punk.

1801
01:36:58.481 --> 01:37:00.857
- Calm down.
- I'll see you in session.

1802
01:37:00.859 --> 01:37:03.818
- Punk!
- Calm down. Fortunato.

1803
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:05.820
Fortunato. calm down!

1804
01:37:05.864 --> 01:37:08.698
First. I'd like to say
that this administration...

1805
01:37:08.699 --> 01:37:11.449
supports the establishment of
the CPI and hopes...

1806
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:14.911
that our representatives will
help us discover the truth.

1807
01:37:15.414 --> 01:37:17.455
I'd also like to say that
the search for the...

1808
01:37:17.457 --> 01:37:19.624
whereabouts of the
journalist and photographer...

1809
01:37:19.626 --> 01:37:22.878
was transferred to
the kidnapping division...

1810
01:37:23.379 --> 01:37:25.462
as there are no bodies.
and no clues...

1811
01:37:25.464 --> 01:37:29.466
I repeat. no evidence
that they were murdered.

1812
01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:32.344
The only evidence we have
until now...

1813
01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:35.014
is the electronic recording
of Rep. Fraga...

1814
01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:38.559
which was obtained illegally
via a wiretap...

1815
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:40.852
ordered by Colonel
Roberto Nascimento...

1816
01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:43.730
in the house of his ex-wife
to spy on her.

1817
01:37:44.649 --> 01:37:45.940
The Governor. obviously...

1818
01:37:45.942 --> 01:37:49.402
has relieved Colonel Nascimento
of his duties and the military police...

1819
01:37:49.404 --> 01:37:51.821
has initiated the process
of his expulsion.

1820
01:38:41.494 --> 01:38:43.577
The politicians were not
interested in my dying...

1821
01:38:43.579 --> 01:38:44.912
before I testify.

1822
01:38:45.414 --> 01:38:47.957
I'd become a martyr of human rights
in the middle of a CPI...

1823
01:38:47.959 --> 01:38:49.625
and Fraga would turn the
Governor...

1824
01:38:49.627 --> 01:38:51.293
into a murder suspect.

1825
01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.420
But the system doesn't have
central planning...

1826
01:38:54.422 --> 01:38:55.922
nor a board of directors.
my friend.

1827
01:38:56.508 --> 01:38:58.424
The system is an inhuman
mechanism...

1828
01:38:58.635 --> 01:39:00.802
an expression of twisted
interests.

1829
01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:04.264
Let's go. folks. It's time.

1830
01:39:04.932 --> 01:39:06.056
- Sup. boss.
- Sup.

1831
01:39:06.058 --> 01:39:07.849
I told you to hide the
shirt. Come on.

1832
01:39:08.852 --> 01:39:10.602
Pull in the front. Nunes.

1833
01:39:12.439 --> 01:39:14.356
The Governor did
what was best for him...

1834
01:39:15.276 --> 01:39:18.402
he smeared my name and
ended my police career.

1835
01:39:27.578 --> 01:39:29.036
I have to go. ok?

1836
01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:35.459
Call me if there's anything.

1837
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:41.798
The tactic of the militia
would be different.

1838
01:39:41.967 --> 01:39:44.467
Rocha knew if someone had
to go down in the CPI...

1839
01:39:44.469 --> 01:39:46.594
the politicians would
dump it all on him.

1840
01:39:46.596 --> 01:39:48.513
Aranha. see where he is.

1841
01:39:48.765 --> 01:39:50.056
Where are you. partner?

1842
01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:52.474
I'm in front of the pub.

1843
01:39:53.019 --> 01:39:55.019
We'll wait behind the hospital.

1844
01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:56.603
Tell us when he comes out. ok?

1845
01:40:04.863 --> 01:40:08.406
For the militia. the sooner
I died. the better.

1846
01:40:09.284 --> 01:40:10.867
He's going to the parking lot.

1847
01:40:37.894 --> 01:40:40.019
Attention. He's coming out.
He's at the door.

1848
01:40:40.021 --> 01:40:42.021
Pull out. partner.
Pull out.

1849
01:40:56.328 --> 01:40:58.453
Let's go. get that cocksucker!

1850
01:41:10.299 --> 01:41:11.632
Luckily. I discovered...

1851
01:41:11.634 --> 01:41:13.550
my true enemies in time.

1852
01:41:14.887 --> 01:41:17.596
When they came. I wasn't alone.

1853
01:41:28.525 --> 01:41:30.066
- You ok?
- Skulls.

1854
01:41:31.945 --> 01:41:34.070
He's on the ground.

1855
01:41:39.368 --> 01:41:40.784
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

1856
01:41:45.541 --> 01:41:47.332
Behind the fucking car!

1857
01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:50.376
Go! Go! Get the other one
get the other one!

1858
01:41:51.546 --> 01:41:53.254
Let's go. Go!

1859
01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.266
The motherfucker escaped...

1860
01:42:06.268 --> 01:42:08.768
but my war on the system
was just beginning.

1861
01:42:09.563 --> 01:42:11.271
Now it was personal.

1862
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.607
And I would keep fighting.
but in a different way.

1863
01:42:17.987 --> 01:42:19.403
Silvio. please.

1864
01:42:21.949 --> 01:42:23.782
The last page of the
document is missing.

1865
01:42:23.784 --> 01:42:26.618
Tell them I need
a xerox to distribute.

1866
01:42:33.585 --> 01:42:35.001
Excuse me. ladies
and gentlemen.

1867
01:42:35.003 --> 01:42:37.628
May I have your attention...

1868
01:42:38.423 --> 01:42:42.049
so that we may hear
the testimony of...

1869
01:42:42.051 --> 01:42:45.011
- Colonel Roberto Nascimento.
- One moment. please.

1870
01:42:45.013 --> 01:42:48.514
I'd like to utter a few
words before this circus.

1871
01:42:48.515 --> 01:42:49.723
Representative. please.

1872
01:42:49.725 --> 01:42:53.310
This CPI was opened on
the eve of elections.

1873
01:42:53.828 --> 01:42:55.645
This is just part of an
electoral campaign.

1874
01:42:55.647 --> 01:42:57.022
You are a clown!

1875
01:42:57.316 --> 01:43:00.608
You're plotting against
the city of Rio de Janeiro.

1876
01:43:00.861 --> 01:43:03.361
You do not have the
right to speak.

1877
01:43:03.362 --> 01:43:04.528
I'm cutting your microphone.

1878
01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:07.781
Rep. Diogo Fraga. you are a clown!

1879
01:43:08.618 --> 01:43:10.868
You're plotting against our city.

1880
01:43:11.454 --> 01:43:13.954
You're plotting against us!

1881
01:43:13.956 --> 01:43:15.080
Gentlemen. please.

1882
01:43:15.082 --> 01:43:16.707
- Let's get to the questions.
- A circus!

1883
01:43:18.627 --> 01:43:20.627
Colonel Nascimento. are you ready?

1884
01:43:21.213 --> 01:43:23.379
Can we start with the questions?

1885
01:43:25.425 --> 01:43:26.674
If you'll allow...

1886
01:43:26.676 --> 01:43:28.718
I would like to say a few words...

1887
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.637
before answering questions.

1888
01:43:30.639 --> 01:43:32.972
You may. Take all the time
you need.

1889
01:43:38.729 --> 01:43:40.771
My name is Roberto Nascimento.

1890
01:43:42.441 --> 01:43:44.483
I am Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Military Police...

1891
01:43:44.485 --> 01:43:46.068
of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

1892
01:43:47.612 --> 01:43:50.738
I've dedicated 21 years
of my life to the police.

1893
01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:55.243
It is thus not easy.
what I'm about to say...

1894
01:43:55.245 --> 01:43:58.079
but the truth is that the
MP of Rio needs to be abolished.

1895
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:05.335
Please.

1896
01:44:05.462 --> 01:44:13.843
When my son was 10...

1897
01:44:13.845 --> 01:44:17.347
he asked me why my job
was to kill.

1898
01:44:23.854 --> 01:44:27.106
My son Rafael.
who is now in the hospital...

1899
01:44:27.108 --> 01:44:29.024
victim of a gunshot.

1900
01:44:32.862 --> 01:44:35.405
And I couldn't answer him.

1901
01:44:38.868 --> 01:44:41.703
I've been a cop 21 years
and I couldn't say...

1902
01:44:41.705 --> 01:44:44.747
for what and for whom I killed.

1903
01:44:46.292 --> 01:44:49.710
But what I can say.
without a doubt. Representatives...

1904
01:44:51.797 --> 01:44:54.673
is that a cop doesn't
pull the trigger alone.

1905
01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.430
Rep. Fraga. half of your
colleagues in this house...

1906
01:45:01.431 --> 01:45:03.639
should be in jail.

1907
01:45:05.476 --> 01:45:06.517
Gentlemen. please.

1908
01:45:06.519 --> 01:45:10.521
I request silence for
the testimony. Please.

1909
01:45:10.523 --> 01:45:12.523
- Half is low. Representative.
- Let's maintain silence!

1910
01:45:12.525 --> 01:45:14.275
Please. Please.

1911
01:45:14.277 --> 01:45:16.319
Half is low. Representative.

1912
01:45:16.945 --> 01:45:19.529
There are only 6 or 7
with a clean sheet.

1913
01:45:20.282 --> 01:45:23.742
Gentlemen. let's maintain silence
for the testimony.

1914
01:45:23.744 --> 01:45:24.784
Please.

1915
01:45:24.786 --> 01:45:29.789
Rep. Fortunato.
you are the leader...

1916
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:32.875
of one of the largest criminal
organizations in this city.

1917
01:45:32.877 --> 01:45:35.753
Please! Let's maintain
silence. please.

1918
01:45:35.755 --> 01:45:38.464
You act in concert with
the Commander...

1919
01:45:38.466 --> 01:45:40.758
the ex-Commander of the MP
of the State of Rio...

1920
01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.927
and ex-Secretary of Security.
Guaracy Novaes...

1921
01:45:43.929 --> 01:45:46.764
one of the worst crooks that
I've had the displeasure of knowing...

1922
01:45:46.765 --> 01:45:48.389
in my life as a police officer.

1923
01:45:49.017 --> 01:45:50.933
And I can affirm here.
Representative...

1924
01:45:51.728 --> 01:45:53.770
that the Governor of the
State of Rio de Janeiro...

1925
01:45:53.772 --> 01:45:56.314
is directly involved in
the crimes...

1926
01:45:56.316 --> 01:45:58.566
under investigation here
in this house.

1927
01:45:59.443 --> 01:46:04.571
I affirm that the Governor
of the State is involved...

1928
01:46:04.573 --> 01:46:07.741
in the crimes investigated
by Rep. Diogo Fraga.

1929
01:46:08.786 --> 01:46:11.578
Rep. Fortunato. you
are responsible for...

1930
01:46:12.247 --> 01:46:15.415
more than 20 murders
in the West Side of the city.

1931
01:46:16.834 --> 01:46:20.753
Among which. you are responsible
for the murder of my friend...

1932
01:46:21.339 --> 01:46:24.590
Captain of the Military Police.
Andre Matias.

1933
01:46:27.804 --> 01:46:29.553
Gentlemen. please!

1934
01:46:29.971 --> 01:46:33.556
Let's maintain silence.
please. Let's refrain...

1935
01:46:33.642 --> 01:46:35.975
I went to Fraga's CPI
to detonate the system.

1936
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.520
I went to speak the truth.

1937
01:46:38.522 --> 01:46:40.438
To say what I felt.

1938
01:46:41.274 --> 01:46:43.733
I told everything I knew.
I acknowledged my errors...

1939
01:46:43.901 --> 01:46:45.984
and spoke for over 3 hours.

1940
01:46:50.533 --> 01:46:52.533
And knocked down a lot of people.

1941
01:46:54.745 --> 01:46:57.538
I put many corrupt
politicians in jail.

1942
01:46:58.331 --> 01:47:00.998
Thanks to my speech.
there were fuckers...

1943
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.418
who ended up in a ditch
long before I had hoped.

1944
01:47:04.963 --> 01:47:07.880
It was the biggest paper-
shredding in Rio's history.

1945
01:47:09.968 --> 01:47:12.844
And even then. the system
remained standing.

1946
01:47:14.722 --> 01:47:17.806
Take his gold and put the anchor
on that piece of shit.

1947
01:47:18.267 --> 01:47:20.684
The system cuts off its hand
to save its arm.

1948
01:47:20.853 --> 01:47:24.354
The system reorganizes.
entertains new interests.

1949
01:47:24.648 --> 01:47:26.440
Creates new leadership.

1950
01:47:26.442 --> 01:47:29.901
Gentlemen. four more years!
Congratulations!

1951
01:47:29.902 --> 01:47:31.743
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations. everyone!

1952
01:47:32.613 --> 01:47:35.448
As long as the conditions for
the system's existence remained...

1953
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:36.782
it would resist.

1954
01:47:36.784 --> 01:47:38.701
We all know that Rep. Guaracy...

1955
01:47:38.703 --> 01:47:42.037
was elected with money from crime.
with money from the militia.

1956
01:47:42.039 --> 01:47:44.790
If you confirm him as
president of this commission...

1957
01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.750
you will certify that
you are like him...

1958
01:47:46.752 --> 01:47:50.295
crooks dressed up as
representatives of the people...

1959
01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:51.337
I request to speak.

1960
01:47:51.339 --> 01:47:52.922
...the source of injustice!

1961
01:47:52.924 --> 01:47:54.299
Calm down. Representative.

1962
01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.384
You do not qualify to be
a congressman.

1963
01:47:56.386 --> 01:47:57.886
- I will not accept...
- Do not quality

1964
01:47:57.887 --> 01:47:59.344
your challenging my
competence...

1965
01:47:59.346 --> 01:48:01.472
- A representative of crime...
...and that of my colleagues.

1966
01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:03.474
cannot be a representative
of the people!

1967
01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:05.684
I was democratically elected
president of this council.

1968
01:48:05.686 --> 01:48:07.269
- Democratically!
- With the evidence...

1969
01:48:07.271 --> 01:48:08.771
- it's irrefutable!
- I was elected...

1970
01:48:08.773 --> 01:48:11.482
and you will have to swallow
your defamatory accusations.

1971
01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:12.900
What I can't swallow is
your criminal record!

1972
01:48:12.901 --> 01:48:14.984
Because I will assume
my duties here...

1973
01:48:14.986 --> 01:48:16.611
whether you like or not.

1974
01:48:22.702 --> 01:48:24.368
Now answer me this...

1975
01:48:24.954 --> 01:48:27.413
who do you think sustains
all this?

1976
01:48:30.375 --> 01:48:34.878
Yeah... And it costs.
It costs a lot.

1977
01:48:37.382 --> 01:48:39.716
The system is much bigger
than I thought.

1978
01:48:40.344 --> 01:48:43.011
There's a reason dealers.
cops and militias...

1979
01:48:43.012 --> 01:48:45.346
kill so many people in the slums.

1980
01:48:45.473 --> 01:48:47.807
There's a reason
the slums even exist.

1981
01:48:48.434 --> 01:48:50.851
There's a reason for all the
scandals in Brasilia and...

1982
01:48:50.853 --> 01:48:53.604
regardless of administration.
for corruption to continue.

1983
01:48:54.398 --> 01:48:57.274
Change takes a long time.

1984
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.527
The system is fucked up.

1985
01:49:01.488 --> 01:49:03.738
A lot of innocent folks
will keep dying.

1986
01:49:40.733 --> 01:49:41.983
Rafa!
