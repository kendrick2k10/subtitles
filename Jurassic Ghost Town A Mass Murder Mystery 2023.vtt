I have never seen anything
like this in my whole career.

8
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.166

dinosaurs a long time.

39
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.367

So. Taylor. safety. weather.

41
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.166
On site. it's gonna be
about 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

42

[Ronan] <i>This remote corner</i>

51

52

about six

53
00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.166

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:21.867

[Phil] What have you got?

105
00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:09.100
So. I was cleaning up the wall

106
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.000
for the stratigraphic column

107
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.634
and found this nice big
limb bone right here--

108
00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:14.867
[Phil] Ooh.

109
00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:16.233
Can I have that?

110
00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:19.500
Wow.

111
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.600
[man] It's a bit cracked--

112
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.900
Oh. it's going into that.
it's going in. it's going in.

113
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.000
[Ronan] <i>Another bone means</i>
<i>another chance</i>

116
00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:32.266
[Phil] <i>Some sites</i>
<i>you find bones.</i>

117
00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.634
<i>Some you find tracks.</i>

118
00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:35.166
and some you find
fossil plants

119
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:38.100
or other creatures that lived
at the time of the dinosaurs.

120
00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:40.533
<i>Here. you find everything.</i>

121
00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:44.166
<i>That's what makes</i>
<i>this site so important.</i>

122
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.533
[Ronan]
<i>First question for Phil.</i>

123
00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:50.900
<i>What kind of dinosaur</i>
<i>did this bone belong to?</i>

124
00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:53.266
Well. it.
it's definitely a limb bone.

125
00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:54.967
-[woman] Yeah.
-There's no question
on that.

126
00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:56.100
And it's from a big animal.

127
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.467
So judging
by the... the depth
and the size of this.

128
00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:00.000
we're probably dealing
with a sauropod dinosaur.

129
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.800
we're probably dealing
with a sauropod dinosaur.

130
00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:10.500
[Ronan] <i>These huge</i>
<i>plant-eating reptiles</i>

131
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.467
<i>dominated</i>
<i>the Jurassic Wild West.</i>

132
00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:18.166
<i>At least 24 different kinds</i>
<i>roamed the forest.</i>

133
00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:20.600
<i>including</i>
<i>the famous diplodocus</i>

134
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.166
<i>and brachiosaurus.</i>

135
00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:25.734
<i>Sauropods were</i>
<i>the biggest creatures</i>

136
00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:27.533
<i>ever to walk the planet.</i>

137
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600
Sauropod dinosaurs really were
the giants of the Jurassic.

138
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.367
at over 90 feet in length.

139
00:06:36.367 --> 00:06:39.967
That's like putting
three Greyhound buses
end to end.

140
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:43.500
The next could be over
25 feet in length

141
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.433
and their tails twice
as long as that.

142
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:54.500
[Ronan] <i>At the far end</i>
<i>of the site.</i>

143
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.600
<i>another huge bone</i>
<i>is now Phil's biggest problem.</i>

144
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.000
This is a massive
shoulder blade

145
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.166
This is a massive
shoulder blade

146
00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:03.100
from this vast
sauropod dinosaur.

147
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.000
[Ronan]
<i>He believes this fossil</i>
<i>could be a crucial key</i>

148
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.600
<i>in understanding</i>
<i>how some of the dinosaurs</i>

149
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.867
<i>might have died here.</i>

150
00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:11.500
[Phil] <i>Hopefully.</i>
<i>by close of play today.</i>

151
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.533
we can lift this thing.

152
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:14.367
It will move
for the first time

153
00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:17.100

154
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.533
[Ronan]
<i>It's not just the bone itself</i>
<i>he's interested in.</i>

155
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.867
<i>the way it's buried and even</i>
<i>what's hidden beneath it</i>

156
00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:26.333
<i>could all help to answer</i>
<i>the question.</i>

157
00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:30.000
<i>But to reach that evidence.</i>
<i>Phil has to dig up the bone.</i>

158
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.800
<i>But to reach that evidence.</i>
<i>Phil has to dig up the bone.</i>

159
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.467
<i>To protect the crime scene.</i>

160
00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:36.467
<i>Phil needs to stabilize</i>
<i>the bone</i>

161
00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:38.467
<i>inside a protective jacket.</i>

162
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.266
[Phil] You cannot flip
the bone this big

163
00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:43.500
without having a nice bandage

164
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.734
holding everything
in or hugging it.

165
00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:48.100
[Ronan] <i>Just like a cast</i>
<i>on a broken limb.</i>

166
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.100
<i>this mixture of plaster</i>
<i>and burlap</i>

167
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.100
<i>should hold</i>
<i>everything together.</i>

168
00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:55.166
<i>But it's extremely heavy.</i>

169
00:07:56.867 --> 00:07:58.800
And how much do you reckon
is the weight. Peter?

170
00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:01.634
Two. three hundred pounds.

171
00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:03.266
Yeah.

172
00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:04.734
A mere 200. 300 pounds.

173
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:08.266
A mere 200 to 300 pounds
of dinosaur.

174
00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:09.734
And that's just the scapula.

175
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.266
[Ronan] <i>It's the riskiest part</i>
<i>of the whole job.</i>

176
00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:15.867
[Phil] <i>At some digs.</i>
<i>you can see</i>

177
00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:17.600
<i>these horrific situations</i>

178
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.600
<i>where bones</i>
<i>or even whole skeletons</i>

179
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.266
<i>have been lifted up</i>
<i>and the jacket utterly fails.</i>

180
00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:24.500
<i>And the animal then sort</i>
<i>of turns to dust</i>

181
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.533
<i>and drops out of the underside</i>
<i>of the jacket.</i>

182
00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:28.233
<i>That's the worst-case</i>
<i>scenario.</i>

183
00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:33.266
-[man] Oh. we can...
-[man] Keep moving.

184
00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:35.100
[man] Keep going.
Can you touch it there?

185
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.166
Yeah. Just checking.
it's flat. Go for it.

186
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:39.166
[man]
Do you want to put a couple
of chisels under there?

187
00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:40.700
-The long chisels?
-[man] Yeah.

188
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.467
[man] One. two. three.

189
00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:44.967
[man] Keep going.
keep going. keep going.

190
00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:46.100
Nice one.

191
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.700
Woo-hoo.

192
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.266
Ho-ho. look scapula.

193
00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.533
That's amazing.

194
00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:53.900
That's beautiful.

195
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.000
There... there you go.

196
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.467
There... there you go.

197
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.367
Six foot four.

198
00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:04.734
When we talk about
our own height.

199
00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:07.367
we think of like.
"I'm five foot nine."

200
00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:10.734
This bone
is a little over six feet.

201
00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:12.634
So standing next to me.

202
00:09:12.634 --> 00:09:14.266
this is the length
of the bone.

203
00:09:15.634 --> 00:09:17.367
[laughing]

204
00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:18.967
[Ronan] <i>Keeping the bone</i>
<i>in one piece</i>

205
00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:20.800
<i>isn't the only good news.</i>

206
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.600
<i>Underneath it.</i>
<i>Phil has struck gold.</i>

207
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.166
<i>a jumble of different fossils.</i>
<i>including parts of a tree.</i>

208
00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:30.000
[Phil] <i>You've got</i>
<i>a complete mash of bones</i>

209
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.266
[Phil] <i>You've got</i>
<i>a complete mash of bones</i>

210
00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.533
<i>and plants and trunks</i>
<i>washed together.</i>

211
00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:36.800
<i>creating this complete mess.</i>
<i>basically.</i>

212
00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:41.166
[Ronan] <i>To Phil's trained eye.</i>
<i>it all points to a potential</i>

213
00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:43.600
<i>cause of death</i>
<i>being swept away</i>

214
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.634
<i>by a fast flowing river.</i>

215
00:09:45.634 --> 00:09:46.700
[Phil] <i>Large chunks of rock</i>

216
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.734
<i>being dragged along</i>
<i>the bed of the river.</i>

217
00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:51.100
<i>That means the river</i>
<i>is in flood to pick up.</i>

218
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.066
<i>move big chunks of rock along.</i>

219
00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.467
<i>And if you ever look</i>
<i>at a river.</i>

220
00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:57.100
<i>where there's a log-jam</i>
<i>and piled up logs.</i>

221
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.533
<i>um. this is the sort</i>
<i>of structure</i>

222
00:09:58.533 --> 00:10:00.000
<i>that would have caught</i>
<i>the bodies of these dinosaurs.</i>

223
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.467
<i>that would have caught</i>
<i>the bodies of these dinosaurs.</i>

224
00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.700
[Ronan] <i>Phil reckons</i>
<i>that a river flowed here</i>

225
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.166
<i>150 million years ago.</i>

226
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.266
Oh. yes.

227
00:10:07.266 --> 00:10:10.266
Oh. that's beautiful.

228
00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:14.800
Looks like a trunk
and some branches coming off.

229
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.700
[Ronan] <i>And he thinks</i>
<i>that a violent storm</i>

230
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.967
<i>once turned it</i>
<i>into a death trap</i>

231
00:10:20.967 --> 00:10:22.734
<i>for at least one dinosaur.</i>

232
00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:26.166
It ended up in a watery grave.

233
00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.900
washed in
with a huge flood deposit.

234
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.166
[Ronan]
<i>But did the dinosaur drown</i>

235
00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.233
<i>or was it dead</i>
<i>before the flood?</i>

236
00:10:35.166 --> 00:10:37.100
<i>Phil can't be sure.</i>

237
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.266
<i>but there was certainly</i>
<i>water here</i>

238
00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:41.066
<i>and lots of it.</i>

239
00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:42.367
<i>Could this be the reason</i>

240
00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:45.467
<i>so many dinosaurs</i>
<i>came to visit the site?</i>

241
00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:51.533
<i>Lower down the hill.</i>

242
00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:55.066
<i>the team has discovered</i>
<i>more evidence of water.</i>

243
00:10:55.066 --> 00:10:57.734
<i>Ripples like</i>
<i>geological fingerprints.</i>

244
00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:00.000
<i>preserved in mud.</i>
<i>that may once have lain</i>

245
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.367
<i>preserved in mud.</i>
<i>that may once have lain</i>

246
00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:03.066
<i>at the bottom</i>
<i>of a very shallow pool.</i>

247
00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:05.634
These ripples
didn't form yesterday.

248
00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:07.867
They formed
150 million years ago.

249
00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.100
when there was
a few millimeters of water

250
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.800
covering
what was this mudflat.

251
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.467
[Ronan]
<i>Phil thinks this was not</i>
<i>a dangerous river.</i>

252
00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.533
<i>but a life-saving</i>
<i>watering hole.</i>

253
00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:23.000
So like this pond-like
environment. shallow water.

254
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.100
the wind was blowing.

255
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.000
the surface
of the water creating

256
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.166
these beautiful ripple marks.

257
00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.000
[Ronan] <i>It could have drawn</i>
<i>dinosaurs to drink here</i>

258
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.967
[Ronan] <i>It could have drawn</i>
<i>dinosaurs to drink here</i>

259
00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:32.600
<i>in huge numbers.</i>

260
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600
If you go to a waterhole today
on the savanna of Africa.

261
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.066
you will see a lot of animals

262
00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.266
drinking at the side
of that waterhole.

263
00:11:42.266 --> 00:11:44.533
It's a very. very busy place.

264
00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:59.600
[Ronan]
<i>Dr. Victoria Egerton wants</i>
<i>to find out</i>

265
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.000
<i>if the area was some kind</i>
<i>of sauropods' Garden of Eden.</i>

266
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.166
<i>if the area was some kind</i>
<i>of sauropods' Garden of Eden.</i>

267
00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:06.166
<i>an oasis of plentiful food.</i>

268
00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:14.100
You can see the bits of fossil
give things a light--

269
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.266
[Ronan]
<i>It's the kind of evidence</i>

270
00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:18.000
<i>that's usually</i>
<i>very hard to find.</i>

271
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.266
<i>But once again.</i>

272
00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:21.367
<i>the Jurassic Mile</i>
<i>is different.</i>

273
00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:24.367
Not only do we get some
really awesome dinosaur bones.

274
00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:26.000
but we get plants.

275
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.900
This is incredibly rare.

276
00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:30.000
<i>It is a treasure trove</i>
<i>of information</i>
<i>for the Jurassic.</i>

277
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.533
<i>It is a treasure trove</i>
<i>of information</i>
<i>for the Jurassic.</i>

278
00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:35.367
not just about the dinosaurs.

279
00:12:35.367 --> 00:12:39.700
<i>but about the environment</i>
<i>that they lived in as well.</i>

280
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.533
[Ronan]
<i>Uncovering these secrets</i>
<i>from the remote past</i>

281
00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:45.734
<i>is what brings Victoria</i>
<i>back here year after year.</i>

282
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.000
<i>What I enjoy</i>
<i>most about paleontology</i>

283
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.166
<i>is that it's storytelling.</i>

284
00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:54.166
You're recreating
this environment

285
00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:56.700
and trying to understand
how these animals live

286
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.634
<i>and what the world</i>
<i>looked like.</i>

287
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.533
[cooing]

288
00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:05.734
[Ronan] <i>Victoria finds</i>
<i>plant fossils everywhere.</i>

289
00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:09.500
<i>It's clear evidence</i>
<i>that this area</i>
<i>was green and lush.</i>

290
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.734
<i>but in a way</i>
<i>that was very alien to us.</i>

291
00:13:12.734 --> 00:13:14.266
<i>During the Jurassic.</i>

292
00:13:14.266 --> 00:13:18.066
<i>the plants and landscape</i>
<i>was pretty different.</i>

293
00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:20.867
We had no flowering plants.

294
00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:24.734
That means no fruits.
no vegetables. and no grass.

295
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.867
<i>You're gonna eat</i>
<i>what's available.</i>

296
00:13:27.867 --> 00:13:30.000
Everything from ferns
to cycads.

297
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.734
Everything from ferns
to cycads.

298
00:13:30.734 --> 00:13:33.367
<i>as well as lots</i>
<i>and lots of conifers</i>

299
00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:34.800
<i>like monkey puzzle trees.</i>

300
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.867
[Ronan]
<i>She soon finds evidence</i>
<i>of a water-loving weed</i>

301
00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:41.367
<i>called horsetails.</i>

302
00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:44.000
That's really nice.

303
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.500
So. right here.
if you look at this one.

304
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.066
what we have here
is Equisetum or horsetail.

305
00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:52.367
And you can see
the stem right there.

306
00:13:52.367 --> 00:13:54.800
And we've got some
little tiny leaves attached.

307
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.166
[Ronan] <i>There may be</i>
<i>plenty of them.</i>

308
00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:00.000
<i>but they're tough</i>
<i>and hard to digest.</i>

309
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.634
<i>but they're tough</i>
<i>and hard to digest.</i>

310
00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:09.500
<i>If this was all there</i>
<i>was to eat.</i>

311
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.467
<i>how did these giant dinosaurs</i>
<i>get enough nutrition?</i>

312
00:14:13.467 --> 00:14:16.533
<i>Did these sauropods starve</i>
<i>to death?</i>

313
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.166
[Ronan] <i>High</i>
<i>in the Wyoming desert.</i>

314
00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:32.634
<i>a dinosaur graveyard</i>
<i>is emerging from the ground.</i>

315
00:14:32.634 --> 00:14:34.867
and a team of scientists
is investigating

316
00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:36.233
the scene of the crime.

317
00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:40.967
<i>They want to know what killed</i>
<i>these Jurassic giants.</i>

318
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:42.634
[Phil] Wow.

319
00:14:42.634 --> 00:14:44.500
[Ronan] <i>So far.</i>
<i>the team has found</i>

320
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.100
<i>the fossilized remains</i>
<i>of 10 dead sauropods.</i>

321
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.066
<i>huge. long-necked dinosaurs</i>

322
00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:52.280
<i>like diplodocus</i>
<i>and brachiosaurus.</i>

323
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.100
<i>like diplodocus</i>
<i>and brachiosaurus.</i>

324
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.533
<i>along with evidence of their</i>
<i>strictly herbivorous diet.</i>

325
00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:02.734
<i>These super-sized animals</i>
<i>had appetites to match.</i>

326
00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:06.533
<i>but only tough.</i>
<i>low-nutrition plants</i>
<i>to sustain them.</i>

327
00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:07.967
<i>Was the Jurassic Mile</i>

328
00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:10.533
<i>too popular</i>
<i>as a dinosaur diner?</i>

329
00:15:11.734 --> 00:15:14.900
<i>Did they run out of food.</i>
<i>too weak to move on</i>

330
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.800
<i>to the next</i>
<i>life-saving Eden?</i>

331
00:15:20.967 --> 00:15:22.280
[Ronan] <i>The answer may come</i>
<i>from living animals.</i>

332
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.634
[Ronan] <i>The answer may come</i>
<i>from living animals.</i>

333
00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:28.266
<i>These enormous reptiles</i>
<i>are giant tortoises.</i>

334
00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:32.166
<i>Together with birds</i>
<i>and crocodiles.</i>

335
00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:33.967
<i>they form a group of animals</i>

336
00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:36.967
<i>that are the closest</i>
<i>living relatives to dinosaurs.</i>

337
00:15:39.367 --> 00:15:42.634
<i>Biologist. Dr. Stephen Blake</i>
<i>and wildlife vet.</i>

338
00:15:42.634 --> 00:15:44.166
<i>Dr. Sharon Deem</i>

339
00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:48.266
<i>have been researching</i>
<i>these animals for 12 years.</i>

340
00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:49.533
<i>both here at the zoo</i>

341
00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:52.000
<i>and in the animal's</i>
<i>natural habitat</i>

342
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.280
<i>on the Galapagos Islands.</i>

343
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.867
<i>on the Galapagos Islands.</i>

344
00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:54.967
[Stephen] All right.

345
00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:56.166
See how big this one is.

346
00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:57.467
Here we go.

347
00:15:59.066 --> 00:16:00.100
[Ronan] <i>They're investigating</i>

348
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.333
<i>how tortoises maintain</i>
<i>a healthy diet.</i>

349
00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:07.867
<i>Here in the zoo.</i>
<i>the tortoises are treated</i>

350
00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:09.734
<i>to a daily vegetable buffet.</i>

351
00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:14.367
<i>But in the wild.</i>
<i>it's a very different story.</i>

352
00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:17.166
In the wild.
the tortoises have to.

353
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:22.266
uh. eat both low-quality
forage and lots of it.

354
00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:22.280
[Ronan] <i>Just like</i>
<i>Jurassic sauropods.</i>

355
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.533
[Ronan] <i>Just like</i>
<i>Jurassic sauropods.</i>

356
00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:27.634
<i>the tortoises can survive</i>
<i>on poor-quality food</i>

357
00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:32.166
<i>that would be unable</i>
<i>to support other large animals</i>

358
00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:34.066
<i>because a cocktail of bacteria</i>

359
00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.367
<i>in their gut helps</i>
<i>to break it down.</i>

360
00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:39.533
<i>extracting precious nutrients</i>
<i>locked inside.</i>

361
00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:42.734
[Sharon] <i>They can really get</i>
<i>a lot of energy.</i>

362
00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:45.066
<i>calories. minerals. vitamins</i>

363
00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:48.533
out of food that may be
less. less quality

364
00:16:48.533 --> 00:16:50.467
<i>than it would be</i>
<i>for someone like us.</i>

365
00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:52.280
[Ronan]
<i>But they're eating strategy</i>

366
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.634
[Ronan]
<i>But they're eating strategy</i>

367
00:16:53.634 --> 00:16:55.367
<i>leaves them</i>
<i>with the same problem</i>

368
00:16:55.367 --> 00:16:56.800
<i>as our sauropods.</i>

369
00:16:58.266 --> 00:17:00.900
<i>Even with their</i>
<i>specialist digestion.</i>

370
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.166
<i>their food is so low</i>
<i>in nutrition</i>

371
00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:05.634
<i>that they need</i>
<i>to eat huge quantities.</i>

372
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.533
<i>Eventually. they eat</i>
<i>everything in sight.</i>

373
00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:12.967
In the dry season.
on the Galapagos.

374
00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:15.166
the lowlands receive
no rainfall

375
00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:17.367
and are very dry
and become very desert like.

376
00:17:17.367 --> 00:17:19.166
<i>There's very little</i>
<i>food around.</i>

377
00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:25.467
[Ronan] <i>Sharon and Steve</i>
<i>decided to find out</i>

378
00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:27.467
<i>how they get around</i>
<i>this problem.</i>

379
00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.367
<i>By fitting GPS trackers</i>

380
00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:34.467
<i>to a group</i>
<i>of Galapagos tortoises.</i>

381
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:37.233
<i>what they discovered</i>
<i>was a huge surprise.</i>

382
00:17:38.533 --> 00:17:40.967
<i>As their own</i>
<i>graphic model reveals</i>

383
00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:42.634
<i>when they run out of food.</i>

384
00:17:42.634 --> 00:17:45.533
<i>hungry giant tortoises</i>
<i>go on a hike.</i>

385
00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:51.166
<i>Well. nobody knew tortoises</i>
<i>migrated. within six months.</i>

386
00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:52.280
we realized that
this phenomenon was real.

387
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.433
we realized that
this phenomenon was real.

388
00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:57.467
<i>When the food runs out</i>
<i>in the lowlands.</i>

389
00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:59.367
<i>they moved to a higher ground.</i>

390
00:18:00.734 --> 00:18:03.367
[Sharon] <i>Giant tortoises go</i>
<i>from the lowlands.</i>

391
00:18:03.367 --> 00:18:06.266
<i>where the food quality is low</i>
<i>to the highland.</i>

392
00:18:06.266 --> 00:18:10.500
where they have a...
what we call
a salad bowl of choices.

393
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.166
[Ronan] <i>Slowly clambering</i>
<i>more than six miles</i>

394
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:14.967
<i>through volcanic</i>
<i>boulder fields.</i>

395
00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:17.066
<i>its equivalent</i>
<i>to a human walking</i>

396
00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:20.000
<i>from New York City</i>
<i>to Philadelphia.</i>

397
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.280
[Stephen] <i>Tortoises</i>
<i>are not known</i>
<i>for their sprinting abilities.</i>

398
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.734
[Stephen] <i>Tortoises</i>
<i>are not known</i>
<i>for their sprinting abilities.</i>

399
00:18:23.734 --> 00:18:24.867
<i>Having said that.</i>

400
00:18:24.867 --> 00:18:26.967
they're a lot more mobile
than people

401
00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:28.533
give them credit for.

402
00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:30.533
[Ronan] <i>Finding enough food</i>
<i>throughout the year</i>

403
00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:33.000
<i>is a major challenge</i>
<i>for big animals.</i>

404
00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:38.000
<i>As they grow larger.</i>
<i>so does their need to feed.</i>

405
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.166
We always say giant tortoises
need a lot of food.

406
00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:41.634
but you imagine a sauropod

407
00:18:41.634 --> 00:18:43.467
needs a colossal
amount of food.

408
00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:45.367
<i>so they got to move</i>
<i>and to get out</i>

409
00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:47.900
<i>of one habitat into another.</i>

410
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.367
<i>You've probably got</i>
<i>to move a long way.</i>

411
00:18:49.367 --> 00:18:51.100
<i>maybe hundreds of miles.</i>

412
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.280
It's the same
evolutionary solution

413
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.367
It's the same
evolutionary solution

414
00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:57.533
to the same problem.

415
00:18:57.533 --> 00:19:00.967
[Ronan]
<i>As food supplies withered</i>
<i>in the Jurassic dry season.</i>

416
00:19:00.967 --> 00:19:02.066
<i>the watering hole</i>

417
00:19:02.066 --> 00:19:03.867
<i>could have been</i>
<i>a vital rest stop</i>

418
00:19:03.867 --> 00:19:06.467
<i>on the way to higher.</i>
<i>greener ground.</i>

419
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.266
<i>But sauropods were many times</i>
<i>bigger than giant tortoises.</i>

420
00:19:13.266 --> 00:19:16.000
<i>How can we know</i>
<i>if they were just as mobile?</i>

421
00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:28.066
<i>Animal movement expert.</i>
<i>Prof. Bill Sellers.</i>

422
00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:31.367
<i>is trying to find out</i>

00:19:31.367 --> 00:19:33.266
<i>weighing up to 80 tons</i>

424
00:19:33.266 --> 00:19:36.533
<i>were capable</i>
<i>of making long journeys.</i>

425
00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:39.166
<i>He's discovered</i>
<i>extraordinary evidence</i>

426
00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.634
<i>that could help</i>
<i>to answer that question.</i>

427
00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:44.634
<i>Super-sized</i>
<i>dinosaur footprints.</i>

428
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.634
I'm interested
in how dinosaurs moved.

429
00:19:48.634 --> 00:19:51.867
And one of the best pieces
of evidence we have

430
00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:52.280
about dinosaur movement
is footprints.

431
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.367
about dinosaur movement
is footprints.

432
00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:55.634
[Ronan] <i>These fallen rocks</i>

433
00:19:55.634 --> 00:19:57.900
<i>were once a patch</i>
<i>of fine sand.</i>

434
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.000
<i>higher up the hill.</i>
<i>and baked into them.</i>

435
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.533
<i>are the tracks of a sauropod</i>

436
00:20:02.533 --> 00:20:06.433
<i>that walked</i>
<i>by 150 million years ago.</i>

437
00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:11.467
You can see the toe marks here
and you can see

438
00:20:11.467 --> 00:20:14.266
the base of the foot
in some detail

439
00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:16.467
'cause they have
rather cylindrical feet

440
00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:18.533
that stick into the ground.

441
00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:21.800
[Ronan] <i>Just one preserved</i>
<i>footprint is a precious find.</i>

442
00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:25.166
<i>But a trackway</i>
<i>of multiple prints</i>

443
00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.233
<i>is an information goldmine.</i>

444
00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:31.266
If we actually
go higher up the cliff.

445
00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:33.533
we can start
to find other footprints.

446
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.533
So. here. we have another
sauropod footprint.

447
00:20:38.533 --> 00:20:40.166
and it's been
cut in half here.

448
00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:42.967
This is almost certainly
from the same. um.

449
00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:44.467
the same trackway as that.

450
00:20:45.367 --> 00:20:47.867
[Ronan] <i>From the pattern</i>
<i>of the footprints.</i>

451
00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:51.967
<i>Bill can use a finely-tuned</i>
<i>computer program</i>

452
00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:52.280
<i>to find out</i>
<i>how this leviathan walked.</i>

453
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.000
<i>to find out</i>
<i>how this leviathan walked.</i>

454
00:20:57.533 --> 00:20:59.166
We can take measurements
from things

455
00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:03.000
like the length of the stride
and the size of the foot.

456
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.266
and then we can use
that to produce a scaled

457
00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:09.533
model of the dinosaur
we think made the tracks.

458
00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:12.166
We have put on the muscles

459
00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.634
that we expect to find
for an animal this size.

460
00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:17.500
And then. we can use
the computer simulation

461
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.266
to try and make it
actually walk in

462
00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:20.800
the trackways
that we'd measured.

463
00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:22.280
[Ronan] <i>Best of all.</i>
<i>Bill's program can calculate</i>

464
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.734
[Ronan] <i>Best of all.</i>
<i>Bill's program can calculate</i>

465
00:21:24.734 --> 00:21:26.634
<i>the dinosaur's top speed.</i>

466
00:21:27.867 --> 00:21:29.734
<i>It's surprisingly high.</i>

467
00:21:29.734 --> 00:21:32.467
<i>Diplodocus didn't dawdle.</i>

468
00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:35.634
These guys can walk at about
7.5 meters per second

469
00:21:35.634 --> 00:21:38.734
simply because they can walk
with really long legs.

470
00:21:38.734 --> 00:21:41.634
So. in fact. um.
it's quite fast.

471
00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:48.734
[Ronan] <i>At more than 15 miles</i>
<i>an hour.</i>

472
00:21:48.734 --> 00:21:51.800
<i>sauropods were as swift</i>

474
00:21:55.533 --> 00:21:57.233

<i>stopping off</i>
<i>at the Jurassic Mile.</i>

477
00:22:02.533 --> 00:22:04.066
<i>like a roadside diner.</i>

478
00:22:04.066 --> 00:22:06.233
<i>for life-saving</i>
<i>food and water.</i>

479
00:22:07.734 --> 00:22:09.867
<i>So. if it wasn't starvation</i>

480

496
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.467
If the weather hits before
the bones are
out of the ground.

497
00:23:08.467 --> 00:23:10.367
it's a potential disaster.

498
00:23:10.367 --> 00:23:13.066
[Ronan] <i>Jen's team rushes</i>

499

500
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.967
<i>They need</i>

501
00:23:18.967 --> 00:23:20.467
Nice weather for ducks.

502
00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:22.280
The storm is coming.
We got to go.

503
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.734
The storm is coming.
We got to go.

504
00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:24.967
Go. go. go.

505
00:23:26.066 --> 00:23:28.367
[Ronan] <i>Now all that protects</i>
<i>this open grave</i>

506
00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:31.266

507
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.100
<i>Phil can only hope</i>

508
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:48.166
[Ronan] <i>In the high desert</i>

512
00:24:01.266 --> 00:24:04.367
<i>And last night.</i>
<i>a ferocious storm</i>

513
00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:09.867
The lightning show

was really amazing.

514

515
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.166
I've never really seen

516
00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:14.734

[Ronan] <i>Storms can destroy</i>

524
00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:36.166
It's a pain when the site
gets wet

525
00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:38.867
'cause it means
you start picking up bone

526
00:24:38.867 --> 00:24:41.920

[Ronan]
<i>But the team is in luck.</i>

529
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:46.100
<i>All the evidence is intact.</i>

530
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.467

531
00:24:51.967 --> 00:24:55.166
<i>So far. the team has found</i>

532
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:57.367
<i>from 10 sauropods.</i>

533
00:24:57.367 --> 00:25:00.967
<i>Giant dinosaurs like</i>
<i>diplodocus and brachiosaurus</i>

534
00:25:00.967 --> 00:25:03.333

<i>between dinosaurs</i>
<i>and modern birds.</i>

541
00:25:23.967 --> 00:25:26.367
<i>which could provide</i>
<i>the best evidence yet</i>

542

<i>of what killed</i>
<i>these giant beasts.</i>

543
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.634
What we have is the neck bone

544
00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:32.000
and curving
into this one

545
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.900
and getting smaller
as we go this way.

546
00:25:36.367 --> 00:25:40.734
[Ronan] <i>There could be</i>
<i>as many as 15</i>

549
00:25:45.066 --> 00:25:48.367
<i>With a tiny head</i>

550

<i>sauropods looked like</i>

551
00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:52.000
<i>one of nature's</i>
<i>great mistakes.</i>

552
00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:55.166
Imagine having
to hold your arm out

553
00:25:55.166 --> 00:25:57.100
and hold a giant rock.

554
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.166
and that's what you have
to do the rest of your life.

555
00:26:00.166 --> 00:26:02.734
Your muscles

556

[Ronan] <i>Their long necks look</i>

<i>hidden inside their necks.</i>

561
00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:18.600
Sauropod dinosaurs are some
of the weirdest animals

562
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.166
ever to have walked

563
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.867

<i>that these organisms</i>
<i>evolved over</i>

565
00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:28.634
<i>millions of years to become</i>

<i>They are the walking</i>

[Ronan] <i>But new research</i>

570
00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:52.867
<i>At the Museum of the Rockies.</i>

571

<i>sauropod expert.</i>
<i>Dr. Cary Woodruff</i>

<i>is investigating</i>
<i>a collection of fossils.</i>

573
00:27:00.266 --> 00:27:03.233
<i>unearthed from another site</i>
<i>in the Morrison formation.</i>

574
00:27:04.634 --> 00:27:07.066
<i>This is from</i>
<i>a long-necked dinosaur</i>

575
00:27:07.066 --> 00:27:09.867
<i>that we discovered.</i>
<i>and we named this animal.</i>
<i>Dolly.</i>

576
00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:11.920
It gets that name
after country Western singer.

577
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.166
It gets that name
after country Western singer.

578
00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.634
Dolly Parton.

579
00:27:13.634 --> 00:27:17.333
So Dolly was alive
about 150 million years ago.

580
00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:21.166
[Ronan]
<i>Examining Dolly's neck bones.</i>

581
00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:23.266
<i>Cary spotted a clue</i>
<i>that gives</i>

582
00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:27.800
<i>an unprecedented glimpse</i>
<i>into the life</i>
<i>and death of this dinosaur.</i>

583
00:27:29.634 --> 00:27:33.266
Well. if we look
at a normal sauropod
vertebra here.

584
00:27:33.266 --> 00:27:36.166
you see the bone
along these areas

585
00:27:36.166 --> 00:27:38.367
is incredibly smooth

586
00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:41.100
and sometimes
almost glassy like.

587
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.920
But I knew something
was special about Dolly

588
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.266
But I knew something
was special about Dolly

589
00:27:43.266 --> 00:27:45.734
because as soon as I looked
at those same areas.

590
00:27:45.734 --> 00:27:47.734
we see that rough
and wrinkled bone

591
00:27:47.734 --> 00:27:50.634
and even coming outside
of some of those sockets

592
00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:51.967
are this weird.

593
00:27:51.967 --> 00:27:54.533
almost broccoli-like
irregular bone growths.

594
00:27:55.867 --> 00:27:56.967
[Ronan] <i>The growths appeared</i>

595
00:27:56.967 --> 00:27:59.333
<i>on several</i>
<i>of Dolly's neck vertebrae.</i>

596
00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:02.634
<i>Puzzled.</i>
<i>Cary shared his discovery</i>

597
00:28:02.634 --> 00:28:04.433
<i>with colleagues</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

598
00:28:05.367 --> 00:28:07.100
<i>I literally took a picture</i>
<i>of these features</i>

599
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.867
<i>and posted it on social media</i>

600
00:28:08.867 --> 00:28:11.000
and said.
"What the heck are these?"

601
00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:14.266
[Ronan] <i>One reply</i>
<i>was from a veterinarian.</i>

602
00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:17.800
<i>who recognized these marks</i>
<i>as a serious bone infection.</i>

603
00:28:19.166 --> 00:28:22.066
<i>And the only way</i>
<i>they could explain</i>
<i>the infection</i>

604
00:28:22.066 --> 00:28:26.066
<i>was by a respiratory disease</i>
<i>that normally affects birds.</i>

605
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.867
The group answer was.
"Holy cow.

606
00:28:29.867 --> 00:28:33.333
we've never seen
a respiratory infection
in a dinosaur before."

607
00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:37.600
[Ronan] <i>Cary wondered</i>
<i>how a bird lung disease</i>

608
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.734
<i>could affect Dolly's bones.</i>

609
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:41.920
<i>The answer lies</i>
<i>in the surprising way</i>

610
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.367
<i>The answer lies</i>
<i>in the surprising way</i>

611
00:28:43.367 --> 00:28:45.634
<i>that sauropods</i>
<i>solve the problem</i>

612
00:28:45.634 --> 00:28:47.734
<i>of holding up</i>
<i>their massive necks.</i>

613
00:28:50.867 --> 00:28:53.500
<i>Paleontologists</i>
<i>think sauropod chests</i>

614
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.266
<i>held large chambers</i>
<i>called air sacs.</i>

615
00:28:57.266 --> 00:29:00.367
<i>They kept the lungs constantly</i>
<i>supplied with oxygen.</i>

616
00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:03.367
<i>Smaller tube-shaped air sacs</i>

617
00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:05.533
<i>ran all the way</i>
<i>along the neck.</i>

618
00:29:05.533 --> 00:29:06.967
<i>surrounding the bones</i>

619
00:29:06.967 --> 00:29:09.100
<i>and filling</i>
<i>their hollow cavities.</i>

620
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.920
<i>This may be the secret</i>

621
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.066
<i>This may be the secret</i>

622
00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:15.867
<i>to how sauropods held up</i>
<i>their long necks.</i>

623
00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:17.867
<i>Taking the place</i>
<i>of dense bone.</i>

624
00:29:17.867 --> 00:29:21.066
<i>the air-filled tubes made them</i>
<i>light enough to lift.</i>

625
00:29:23.266 --> 00:29:24.467
<i>Modern birds</i>

626
00:29:24.467 --> 00:29:27.000
<i>are distant descendants</i>
<i>of dinosaurs.</i>

627
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.367
<i>and birds too have air sacs.</i>

628
00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:32.500
<i>They reduce weight enough</i>
<i>to allow for flight.</i>

629
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.734
<i>but they have a big downside.</i>

630
00:29:34.734 --> 00:29:38.500
<i>They increase birds' risk</i>
<i>of serious infection.</i>

631
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.920
We were able to hypothesize
that Dolly had air sacculitis.

632
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.066
We were able to hypothesize
that Dolly had air sacculitis.

633
00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:45.100
and that
respiratory infection.

634
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.634
the air sacculitis was so bad

635
00:29:47.634 --> 00:29:50.900
that it actually caused
a secondary bone infection.

636
00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:56.734
[Ronan] <i>Using modern</i>
<i>CT-scanning technology.</i>

637
00:29:56.734 --> 00:29:57.867
<i>Cary can work out</i>

638
00:29:57.867 --> 00:30:00.533
<i>just how advanced</i>
<i>the infection was.</i>

639
00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:04.066
[Cary] Dolly would have
had labored breathing.

640
00:30:04.066 --> 00:30:06.467
probably sneezing
and nasal discharge.

641
00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:07.867
and. basically.
the same symptoms

642
00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:09.533
that we think
of that we've all had

643
00:30:09.533 --> 00:30:11.920
with the cold or flu
or pneumonia.

644
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.367
with the cold or flu
or pneumonia.

645
00:30:12.367 --> 00:30:15.066
[Ronan] <i>The scans reveal</i>
<i>that Dolly's air sac infection</i>

646
00:30:15.066 --> 00:30:18.166
<i>had spread</i>
<i>deep inside the bones.</i>

647
00:30:18.166 --> 00:30:21.734
<i>causing illness far more</i>
<i>serious than a cold.</i>

648
00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:25.166
Here we have a case.
from 150 million years ago.

649
00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:28.367
of an individual dinosaur
that was sick.

650
00:30:28.367 --> 00:30:30.500

it probably died

651
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.867
from that illness.

652
00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:33.867
And I think those are

653
00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:35.266
the closest thing
to time machines

654
00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.634
we'll ever get
these little windows

655
00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:41.266

in the life of a dinosaur.

656
00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:45.634
[Ronan] <i>Were the dinosaurs</i>

661
00:31:03.734 --> 00:31:05.367
<i>the team will need</i>
<i>to keep looking</i>

662
00:31:05.367 --> 00:31:07.333
<i>for other potential killers.</i>

663
00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:14.100
<i>The answer</i>

664
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.166
<i>Back on site.</i>

665
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:19.634
<i>Jen has unearthed</i>
<i>another spectacular discovery</i>

666
00:31:19.634 --> 00:31:22.100
<i>that may be the lead</i>
<i>they're looking for.</i>

667
00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:25.367
[Ronan] <i>This new find revealed</i>

668
00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:27.066
<i>that the long-necked sauropods</i>

669

weren't the only visitors
to this watering hole.

670
00:31:31.266 --> 00:31:34.266
<i>And the others may have</i>
<i>had murder on their mind.</i>

671
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.634
<i>In the Wyoming Badlands.</i>

672
00:31:46.634 --> 00:31:50.100
<i>a 150-million-year-old</i>
<i>crime scene</i>

673
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.066
<i>is emerging from the ground.</i>

674
00:31:53.166 --> 00:31:56.166
<i>A team of paleontologists</i>
<i>is trying to figure out</i>

675
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:59.100
<i>how 10 giant</i>
<i>sauropod dinosaurs</i>

676
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.166
<i>met their end right here.</i>

677
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.634
<i>Investigations have revealed</i>
<i>that some of the dinosaurs</i>

678
00:32:06.634 --> 00:32:10.533
<i>may have been killed</i>
<i>in sudden floods</i>

679
00:32:10.533 --> 00:32:11.440
<i>and also that their</i>
<i>neck-lightening air sacs</i>

680

<i>and also that their</i>
<i>neck-lightening air sacs</i>

681
00:32:13.166 --> 00:32:15.634
<i>could risk severe infections.</i>

682
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.533
<i>Now. Jen may have discovered</i>
<i>a major new suspect...</i>

683
00:32:23.533 --> 00:32:26.467
<i>A skeleton that reveals</i>
<i>the long-necked sauropods</i>

684
00:32:26.467 --> 00:32:29.467

to this watering hole.

685
00:32:29.467 --> 00:32:32.166
Right here.
we have a large theropod.

686
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.867
We've got back. we've got hip.

687
00:32:34.867 --> 00:32:38.000
all the way back
to a lovely tail.

688
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.967
[Ronan] <i>Lying just feet away</i>
<i>from the emerging tail bones</i>

689
00:32:40.967 --> 00:32:41.440
<i>of a plant-eating sauropod.</i>

690
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.734
<i>of a plant-eating sauropod.</i>

691
00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:45.100
<i>her diggers have uncovered</i>

692
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.533
<i>the backbone</i>
<i>of a ferocious carnivore.</i>

693
00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:51.100
<i>Jen thinks this may be</i>
<i>a skeleton</i>

694
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.000
<i>of the apex predator</i>
<i>of the Jurassic Wild West.</i>

695
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.233
Allosaurus.

696
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:02.967
[Ronan] <i>Eighty million years</i>
<i>before T. rex.</i>

697
00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:06.634
<i>allosaurus was the king</i>
<i>of the Jurassic Frontier.</i>

698
00:33:06.634 --> 00:33:08.100
[cooing]

699
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.367
[Ronan] <i>It attacked its prey</i>
<i>with razor sharp.</i>

700
00:33:10.367 --> 00:33:11.440
<i>serrated teeth</i>
<i>and powerful grasping arms.</i>

701
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.734
<i>serrated teeth</i>
<i>and powerful grasping arms.</i>

702
00:33:17.867 --> 00:33:21.367
<i>So was this watering hole</i>
<i>the site of a bloody clash</i>

703
00:33:21.367 --> 00:33:23.166
<i>between predator and prey?</i>

704
00:33:24.467 --> 00:33:26.967
<i>And since</i>
<i>both bodies fell here.</i>

705
00:33:26.967 --> 00:33:28.367
<i>who came out on top?</i>

706
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.000
<i>To find out. Jen needs</i>
<i>to study this apex predator.</i>

707
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
<i>That means getting it out</i>
<i>of the ground</i>

708
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
<i>intact to look</i>
<i>for signs of violence.</i>

709
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.100
But it's lying in a bed
of super hard rock.

710
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.634
We've actually
broken rock saws

711
00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:48.166
and crowbars on this.

712
00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:50.634
So it's gonna take some
special kinds of equipment.

713
00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:56.467
[Ronan]
<i>They've had to bring in</i>
<i>an air-powered mini jackhammer</i>

714
00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.066
<i>to chip away at the stone.</i>

715
00:33:59.467 --> 00:34:01.800
The first thing is just like
feeling the vibrations

716
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.000
and feeling a bit scared

717
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.867
that you have something
powerful in your hand.

718
00:34:04.867 --> 00:34:06.800
[Ronan] <i>This tool brings</i>
<i>its own danger.</i>

719

723
00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:15.967
[Ronan]
<i>It's painstaking work.</i>

724
00:34:15.967 --> 00:34:21.533

761
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.266
Ooh.

762
00:36:26.166 --> 00:36:28.266
Oh. thank God. You look good.

763
00:36:28.266 --> 00:36:31.000
This fossil
is already very exposed.

764
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
so it could have gotten
a lot of abrasion damage.

765
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.166
Looks like maybe
one piece broke.

766
00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:39.100
So. uh. that's the only thing
that broke.

767

Yeah.

774
00:37:02.533 --> 00:37:05.533
Yeah. well. I think. I think

<i>a fleeing sauropod.</i>

828
00:39:25.266 --> 00:39:29.533
<i>He's pioneering a new method</i>
<i>of calculating dinosaur speeds</i>

829
00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:31.467
<i>with a detailed</i>
<i>computer model.</i>

830
00:39:32.467 --> 00:39:34.280
<i>based on the size</i>
<i>of their bones</i>

831
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:34.367
<i>based on the size</i>
<i>of their bones</i>

832
00:39:34.367 --> 00:39:36.100
<i>and the bounce of their tails.</i>

833
00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:39.634
Potentially.
it might have been
able to run very fast.

834
00:39:39.634 --> 00:39:41.166
but we don't know yet.

835
00:39:42.634 --> 00:39:44.634
[Ronan] <i>He's found</i>
<i>the ideal specimen</i>

836
00:39:44.634 --> 00:39:46.967
<i>to answer the question.</i>

837
00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:49.634
<i>Its leg bones</i>
<i>are perfectly preserved.</i>

838
00:39:50.634 --> 00:39:54.266
Right now.
I'm measuring the left tibia.

839
00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:55.800
which is the left shin bone.

840
00:39:58.734 --> 00:40:01.734
It's about 23.5 inches.

841
00:40:01.734 --> 00:40:04.266
[Ronan] <i>Pasha soon has</i>
<i>all the measurements he needs</i>

842
00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:04.280
<i>to see how this predator moves</i>

843
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.967
<i>to see how this predator moves</i>

844
00:40:06.967 --> 00:40:11.367
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in 150 million years.</i>

845
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:14.166
<i>And to find out</i>
<i>if allosaurus had the pace</i>

846
00:40:14.166 --> 00:40:16.734
<i>to catch a speedy sauropod.</i>

847
00:40:16.734 --> 00:40:20.266
It's actually a bit more work
than I would have liked.

848
00:40:20.266 --> 00:40:21.367
Right.

849
00:40:21.367 --> 00:40:23.734
[Ronan] <i>Bill Sellers</i>
<i>is teaming up with Pasha</i>

850
00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:25.533
<i>after discovering</i>
<i>that sauropods</i>

851
00:40:25.533 --> 00:40:28.166
<i>could move</i>
<i>at 15 miles an hour.</i>

852
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:30.233
<i>as fast as Olympic athletes.</i>

853
00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:33.734
<i>Bill has researched</i>
<i>the top speeds</i>

854
00:40:33.734 --> 00:40:34.280
<i>of different predatory</i>
<i>dinosaurs</i>

855
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.734
<i>of different predatory</i>
<i>dinosaurs</i>

856
00:40:35.734 --> 00:40:37.000
<i>in past studies.</i>

857
00:40:38.066 --> 00:40:40.533
You have these
wonderful pointy sources.

858
00:40:40.533 --> 00:40:42.266
but we did a T. rex
and allosaurus.

859
00:40:42.266 --> 00:40:43.634
various other theropods.

860
00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:45.533
We came up with top speeds

861
00:40:45.533 --> 00:40:48.800
from this of about 8 meters
per second for the T. rex.

862
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.266
Uh. so. it's the slowest.

863
00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:53.166
And then. just over 10 meters
per second for the allosaurus.

864
00:40:53.166 --> 00:40:54.533
[Ronan] <i>Using his models.</i>

865
00:40:54.533 --> 00:40:56.533
<i>Bill estimated</i>
<i>that both predators</i>

866
00:40:56.533 --> 00:41:00.100
<i>might be able to run</i>
<i>at nearly 20 miles an hour.</i>

867
00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:04.280
<i>But he discovered</i>
<i>a big problem for big T. rex.</i>

868
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.967
<i>But he discovered</i>
<i>a big problem for big T. rex.</i>

869
00:41:05.967 --> 00:41:10.066
It was only when we started
looking at the bone loading

870
00:41:10.066 --> 00:41:13.467
that the really high speeds
on the T. rex seemed unlikely

871
00:41:13.467 --> 00:41:17.066
because. as you know.
when you run faster.

872
00:41:17.066 --> 00:41:18.734
you put more stress
on the bone.

873
00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.000
[Ronan] <i>Bill concluded that</i>
<i>if T. rex tried to run.</i>

874
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.533
<i>it would break its own legs.</i>

875
00:41:27.533 --> 00:41:29.100
<i>At best. it could manage</i>

876
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.166
<i>little more than</i>
<i>a 10-mile-an-hour walk.</i>

877
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.280
<i>not even enough to catch</i>
<i>a sauropod at full tilt.</i>

878
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.166
<i>not even enough to catch</i>
<i>a sauropod at full tilt.</i>

879
00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:37.967
<i>But can Pasha's</i>
<i>prototype model</i>

880
00:41:37.967 --> 00:41:41.000
<i>reveal whether allosaurus</i>
<i>was fast enough</i>

881
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.734
<i>to catch a speeding sauropod?</i>

882
00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.367
Allosaurus was further away

883
00:41:45.367 --> 00:41:48.066
from T. rex than T. rex
was from us.

884
00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:49.266
So there are bound to be

885
00:41:49.266 --> 00:41:52.166
many differences
between these animals.

886
00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:53.967
[Ronan] <i>His research takes</i>
<i>into account</i>

887
00:41:53.967 --> 00:41:57.166
<i>the built-in bounce</i>
<i>of allosaurus' tail.</i>

888
00:41:57.166 --> 00:42:00.066
<i>He's shown that their tails</i>
<i>had a natural rhythm</i>

889
00:42:00.066 --> 00:42:01.634
<i>like a pendulum.</i>

890
00:42:01.634 --> 00:42:04.000
<i>and he believes that</i>
<i>if they stepped in time</i>

891
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.280
<i>with that rhythm.</i>
<i>they could walk much faster.</i>

892
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.634
<i>with that rhythm.</i>
<i>they could walk much faster.</i>

893
00:42:07.634 --> 00:42:10.066
<i>We treated the entire tail</i>
<i>as this big</i>

894
00:42:10.066 --> 00:42:11.867
rod suspended by springs.

895
00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:14.734
And if you find
the natural frequency of this.

896
00:42:14.734 --> 00:42:16.634
um. I think this gives you
a good idea

897
00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.166
of the step frequency.

898
00:42:18.166 --> 00:42:21.634
So. it's much more sort
of pogo-stick-type locomotion.

899
00:42:21.634 --> 00:42:23.233
relying on elastic storage.

900
00:42:25.266 --> 00:42:28.266
[Ronan]
<i>With all the data entered</i>
<i>into Pasha's test model.</i>

901
00:42:28.266 --> 00:42:30.800
<i>his allosaurus</i>
<i>quickly gathers speed...</i>

902
00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:34.280
<i>And runs at an astonishing</i>
<i>25 miles an hour.</i>

903
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.734
<i>And runs at an astonishing</i>
<i>25 miles an hour.</i>

904
00:42:37.066 --> 00:42:38.734
<i>Compared to T. rex.</i>

905
00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:41.734
<i>allosaurus was like</i>
<i>a thoroughbred racehorse.</i>

906
00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:44.367
<i>It could easily outpace</i>

907
00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:47.266
<i>a retreating sauropod</i>
<i>like diplodocus.</i>

908
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.266
<i>The team has shown that</i>
<i>sauropods and allosauruses</i>

909
00:42:54.266 --> 00:42:57.066
<i>both visited</i>
<i>this watering hole</i>

910
00:42:57.066 --> 00:42:59.734
<i>and allosaurus</i>
<i>had the speed to run down</i>

911
00:42:59.734 --> 00:43:01.900
<i>the giant herbivores.</i>

912
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.280
<i>But maybe</i>
<i>it wasn't just about speed.</i>

913
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.266
<i>But maybe</i>
<i>it wasn't just about speed.</i>

914
00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.100
<i>it was about surprise too.</i>

915
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.266
<i>If so. how could</i>
<i>a three-ton allosaurus</i>

916
00:43:11.266 --> 00:43:12.533
<i>creep up on a sauropod</i>

917
00:43:12.533 --> 00:43:16.000
<i>and launch an attack</i>
<i>without being noticed?</i>

918
00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:18.634
<i>To answer that.</i>

919
00:43:18.634 --> 00:43:21.533
<i>scientists are studying</i>
<i>living animals.</i>

920
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.433
<i>At Whipsnade Zoo</i>
<i>in England...</i>

921
00:43:33.166 --> 00:43:34.280
<i>Dr. Beth Mortimer</i>

922
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.066
<i>Dr. Beth Mortimer</i>

923
00:43:36.066 --> 00:43:39.367
<i>and Dr.Tarje Nissen-Meyer</i>

924
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:41.533
<i>are researching animal senses.</i>

925
00:43:43.367 --> 00:43:45.634
Hopefully. they would come
through the fence here

926
00:43:45.634 --> 00:43:46.967
and we can pick up
the vibrations--

927
00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:48.066
Hopefully.

928
00:43:48.066 --> 00:43:50.066
[Ronan] <i>Beth and Tarje</i>
<i>want to find out</i>

929
00:43:50.066 --> 00:43:52.266
<i>how today's</i>
<i>biggest land animals</i>

930
00:43:52.266 --> 00:43:56.100
<i>detect threats</i>
<i>like approaching predators.</i>

931
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.100
<i>In particular.</i>

932
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.900
<i>they want to see</i>
<i>whether elephants</i>

933
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.734
<i>can use</i>
<i>a special sixth sense.</i>

934
00:44:01.734 --> 00:44:04.166
<i>which tunes in</i>
<i>to seismic vibrations</i>

935
00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:04.280
<i>in the ground.</i>

936
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.634
<i>in the ground.</i>

937
00:44:05.634 --> 00:44:06.867
How far away do you think

938
00:44:06.867 --> 00:44:08.166
we'll be able to pick up
the elephants?

939
00:44:08.166 --> 00:44:09.967
Huh. completely depends on
what they're doing.

940
00:44:11.634 --> 00:44:13.166
Let me try here.

941
00:44:16.867 --> 00:44:18.967
[Ronan] <i>Elephants</i>
<i>are the modern-day equivalent</i>

942
00:44:18.967 --> 00:44:21.266
<i>of the</i> Jurassic's giant
<i>sauropods.</i>

943
00:44:22.266 --> 00:44:24.800
[Beth] <i>The reason we studied</i>
<i>elephants to start off</i>

944
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.634
<i>with is because of their size.</i>

945
00:44:27.634 --> 00:44:29.867
<i>Because elephants</i>
<i>are really large.</i>

946
00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.533
they're generating
a lot of motion in the ground.

947
00:44:32.533 --> 00:44:34.280
kind of mini earthquakes.
if you like.

948
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:34.800
kind of mini earthquakes.
if you like.

949
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.734
just as they're moving around.

950
00:44:36.734 --> 00:44:39.166
[Ronan] <i>So. the way</i>
<i>they detect threats may shed</i>

951
00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:42.166
<i>light on the way their ancient</i>
<i>counterparts did.</i>

952
00:44:43.266 --> 00:44:47.166
<i>Ground vibrations are almost</i>
<i>undetectable to humans.</i>

953
00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:49.467
<i>but can be picked up</i>
<i>by elephants through</i>

954
00:44:49.467 --> 00:44:51.634
<i>special sensors in their feet.</i>

955
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.100
We've got sensors
that are embedded

956
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.000
in our skin. uh.
which can detect vibrations.

957
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.166
um. and elephants
have a large number

958
00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:02.467
of these types of sensors
on their feet.

959
00:45:04.266 --> 00:45:04.280
[Ronan] <i>Beth and Tarje</i>
<i>use a geophone.</i>

960
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.066
[Ronan] <i>Beth and Tarje</i>
<i>use a geophone.</i>

961
00:45:08.066 --> 00:45:12.367
<i>a sensor that can detect</i>
<i>ultra-low vibrations.</i>

962
00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:15.533
-[Tarje] The audible sound.
are you recording them?
-[Beth] Yes.

963
00:45:15.533 --> 00:45:17.533
We got the elephant coming
over here.

964
00:45:17.533 --> 00:45:21.333
so we're just picking up. uh.
the vibrations
that she's making.

965
00:45:22.266 --> 00:45:25.467
[Ronan] <i>In her fieldwork</i>
<i>in Kenya. Africa.</i>

966
00:45:25.467 --> 00:45:27.800
<i>Beth has shown that</i>
<i>seismic senses</i>

967
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.433
<i>are a vital part</i>
<i>of an elephant's</i>
<i>defensive system.</i>

968
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:34.280
<i>Her team records</i>
<i>seismic ground vibrations</i>

969
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.166
<i>Her team records</i>
<i>seismic ground vibrations</i>

970
00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:39.266
<i>made by humans.</i>

971
00:45:39.266 --> 00:45:42.533
<i>When these vibrations</i>
<i>are played back to elephants.</i>

972
00:45:42.533 --> 00:45:44.066
<i>they are able</i>
<i>to interpret them</i>

973
00:45:44.066 --> 00:45:46.967
<i>as dangerous</i>
<i>and quickly retreat.</i>

974
00:45:51.367 --> 00:45:55.867
<i>Elephants are not alone</i>
<i>in tuning</i>
<i>into this infrasonic world.</i>

975
00:45:55.867 --> 00:45:59.367
<i>Beth and Tarje have studied</i>
<i>this kind of seismic detection</i>

976
00:45:59.367 --> 00:46:01.467
<i>in a number</i>
<i>of different animals.</i>

977
00:46:02.533 --> 00:46:04.280
<i>And Tarje thinks that</i>
<i>one making vibrations</i>

978
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.533
<i>And Tarje thinks that</i>
<i>one making vibrations</i>

979
00:46:05.533 --> 00:46:10.266
<i>as large as a sauropod</i>
<i>would also evolve</i>
<i>to detect them.</i>

980
00:46:10.266 --> 00:46:12.734
[Tarje] <i>So. we know</i>
<i>many examples</i>
<i>in the animal world</i>

981
00:46:12.734 --> 00:46:14.867
that use seismic sensing.

982
00:46:14.867 --> 00:46:17.066
So. it's... I think.
the best assumption to...

983
00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:19.867
to think. well.
if there's a signal. um.

984
00:46:19.867 --> 00:46:21.734
why shouldn't they use it?

985
00:46:21.734 --> 00:46:24.100
[Ronan] <i>It's likely these</i>
<i>giants could have detected</i>

986
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.367
<i>seismic signals</i>
<i>from a very long way away.</i>

987
00:46:28.367 --> 00:46:30.100
[Beth] <i>Essentially.</i>
<i>the bigger they are.</i>

988
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.533
<i>the larger distances over</i>
<i>which they can communicate.</i>

989
00:46:33.533 --> 00:46:34.280
So. if you have
a larger dinosaur source

990
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.166
So. if you have

<i>through the ground. in theory.</i>

993
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.467
that's then information that
could be propagating over
larger distances.

994
00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:51.467
[Ronan] <i>Just like their giant</i>

[Jennifer]
One of the very interesting
discoveries

1073
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.634
we have of this year
that was only found
a couple of days ago.

1074
00:51:34.634 --> 00:51:37.500
So. we've got a tail going
into the wall.

1075
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.100
So. this is something
we really want to focus
on this year.

1076
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.266
[Ronan] <i>A sauropod's tail</i>
<i>could exceed 25 feet</i>

1077
00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.240

1078
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.900
<i>in length and weigh</i>
<i>5.000 pounds.</i>

1079
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.900
Right now. we have one. two.
three. four.

1080
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.600
five. six.
seven is poking out.

1081
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.900
They can have about
80 bones in just the tail.

1082
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.266
[Ronan] <i>The tail was more</i>
<i>than five feet thick</i>

1083
00:51:59.266 --> 00:52:02.100
<i>at the base and tapered down</i>
<i>to the thickness</i>

1084
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.467
<i>of a pencil at the tip.</i>

1085
00:52:04.467 --> 00:52:06.700
[Jennifer] And the good news
is they're getting larger.

1086
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.266
They're going from the size
of my pinky to something

1087
00:52:09.266 --> 00:52:12.000
that's gonna be like
serving plate size.

1088
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.240
[Ronan] <i>For decades.</i>
<i>paleontologists have wondered</i>

1089
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:14.634
[Ronan] <i>For decades.</i>
<i>paleontologists have wondered</i>

1090
00:52:14.634 --> 00:52:19.000
<i>why sauropods</i>
<i>had such long whip like tails.</i>

1091
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.533
<i>Was it part</i>
<i>of their defensive armory?</i>

1092
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:31.500
<i>In Seattle. Washington.</i>
<i>a team is trying to find out.</i>

1093
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.533
<i>They're headed up</i>
<i>by tech pioneer.</i>
<i>Dr. Nathan Myhrvold.</i>

1094
00:52:36.967 --> 00:52:39.800
[Nathan] <i>I was always</i>
<i>fascinated by dinosaurs</i>
<i>as a child.</i>

1095
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.166
And ever since the discovery
of the sauropod dinosaurs.

1096
00:52:44.166 --> 00:52:44.240
people wondered
what was this
enormous tail for.

1097
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.266
people wondered
what was this
enormous tail for.

1098
00:52:48.266 --> 00:52:50.967
[Ronan] <i>Nathan's company</i>
<i>specializes in solving</i>

1099
00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:54.800
<i>scientific mysteries</i>
<i>by thinking outside the box.</i>

1100
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.166
<i>To decipher the riddle</i>
<i>of the sauropod tail.</i>

1101
00:52:59.166 --> 00:53:01.367
<i>they came up with this.</i>

1102
00:53:03.367 --> 00:53:07.100
[Nathan] So. this is
a physical model of a tail

1103
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.600
of a sauropod dinosaur.

1104
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.100
Specifically. it's an exact
replica of an apatosaurus

1105
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.240
that's in the American Museum
of Natural History.

1106
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.900
that's in the American Museum
of Natural History.

1107
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.166
So... So. this is
a one-quarter scale model.

1108
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:23.066
So. it's around 12-feet long.

1109
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.533
[Ronan] <i>Even without</i>
<i>any soft tissue.</i>

1110
00:53:27.533 --> 00:53:29.600
<i>the lightweight</i>
<i>aluminum construction</i>

1111
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.166
<i>is as close to the real thing</i>
<i>as Nathan's engineering team</i>
<i>can create.</i>

1112
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.867
The scale mass is correct
within less than a percent.

1113
00:53:40.867 --> 00:53:42.467
So. it's very accurate.

1114
00:53:42.467 --> 00:53:44.240
[Ronan] <i>Now. it's time to see</i>
<i>what this model can do.</i>

1115
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.266
[Ronan] <i>Now. it's time to see</i>
<i>what this model can do.</i>

1116
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:50.467
<i>Immediately. Nathan detects</i>
<i>a problem with the fine.</i>

1117
00:53:50.467 --> 00:53:52.634
<i>delicate tip of the tail.</i>

1118
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.100
[Nathan] <i>There are dinosaurs</i>
<i>that use tails</i>

1119
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:59.367
as defensive weapons.
and they almost always
have clubs or spikes

1120
00:53:59.367 --> 00:54:02.266
or something really nasty
on the end
to get something with.

1121
00:54:02.266 --> 00:54:05.100
<i>The trouble is the end</i>
<i>of it is really skinny.</i>

1122
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.734
<i>it's less than a garden hose.</i>

1123
00:54:06.734 --> 00:54:10.166
It didn't seem plausible to me
that they were a weapon.

1124
00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:13.600
[Ronan] <i>He believes the tail</i>
<i>wasn't designed for fighting.</i>

1125
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.240
<i>Instead. he wonders</i>
<i>if they may have had</i>

1126
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.500
<i>Instead. he wonders</i>
<i>if they may have had</i>

1127
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.066
<i>a much less violent purpose.</i>
<i>communication.</i>

1128
00:54:21.066 --> 00:54:24.066
<i>Nathan believes</i>
<i>the tail's shape</i>
<i>could make it perfect</i>

1129
00:54:24.066 --> 00:54:26.000
<i>to act like a bullwhip.</i>

1130
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.367
<i>Cracked with enough force</i>
<i>to create a sonic boom.</i>

1131
00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:32.700
So. in the same way
that a human can pick up

1132
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.266
a bullwhip and
with a very ordinary arm
can make it crack.

1133
00:54:36.266 --> 00:54:39.166
<i>I think this would require</i>
<i>a negligible amount of energy</i>

1134
00:54:39.166 --> 00:54:40.867
<i>in the sauropod's part.</i>

1135
00:54:43.166 --> 00:54:44.240
[Ronan] <i>High-speed cameras</i>
<i>record the tail in action.</i>

1136
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.533
[Ronan] <i>High-speed cameras</i>
<i>record the tail in action.</i>

1137
00:54:50.266 --> 00:54:53.266
So. here. we are moving
the tail.

1138
00:54:53.266 --> 00:54:55.634
And what's gonna happen
is that tail...

1139
00:54:55.634 --> 00:54:59.166
this part here will get
flipped up. and boom.

1140
00:54:59.166 --> 00:55:02.166
there it gets flipped up
and that would be
the sonic boom.

1141
00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:04.367
[Ronan] <i>Nathan calculates</i>
<i>that the tip of the tail</i>

1142
00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:09.734
<i>exceeds 760 miles per hour.</i>
<i>faster than the speed</i>

going off.

1148
00:55:21.533 --> 00:55:23.100

1149
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.467
Kaboom!

1150
00:55:25.467 --> 00:55:28.467
[Ronan] <i>Nathan thinks</i>
<i>sauropods may have</i>
<i>used their tails</i>

1151
00:55:28.467 --> 00:55:30.467
<i>to get a dinosaur date.</i>

1152
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.600
[Nathan] <i>I think</i>
<i>it's a good chance</i>

1153
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.066
that they used this amazingly
loud noise

1154
00:55:37.066 --> 00:55:39.467
<i>that they create</i>
<i>with their tails</i>

1155

1156
00:55:41.467 --> 00:55:43.533
You know. "Kaboom! See?

1157
00:55:43.533 --> 00:55:44.240

1158

I can really crack my tail."

1159
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.634
And then. the next guy says.
"Oh. yeah. you heard that?"

1160
00:55:47.634 --> 00:55:49.367
Kaboom.

1161
00:55:49.367 --> 00:55:52.100
[Ronan] <i>Nathan doesn't claim</i>

1163
00:55:56.266 --> 00:55:57.600
[Nathan] <i>Just a question</i>
<i>of. okay.</i>

1164
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.066
<i>what does the mathematics say?</i>

1165
00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:02.533
<i>If we do an accurate</i>
<i>engineering model.</i>

1166
00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:04.967
what is the answer?

1167
00:56:04.967 --> 00:56:07.000
The answer comes out.
of course.

1168
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
that it cracks supersonically.
[cooing]

1169
00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.100

<i>the weight</i>
<i>of its alleged assailant</i>

1174
00:56:22.734 --> 00:56:27.066
<i>was a sauropod just too big</i>

1175
00:56:28.066 --> 00:56:30.266
<i>This missing piece</i>
<i>of the predatory puzzle</i>

1176
00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:31.967

1177
00:56:31.967 --> 00:56:35.433
<i>Allosaurus</i>

1178

<i>Victoria is examining evidence</i>

1179
00:56:45.867 --> 00:56:47.000
[woman] Yeah.

1180
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.266
[Victoria] Hey. guys.
What you got?

1181
00:56:48.266 --> 00:56:49.600
Hey.

1182

<i>of several allosauruses.</i>

1184
00:56:56.367 --> 00:56:58.467
Within this block.
we have at least two.

1185
00:56:58.467 --> 00:57:00.533
maybe three allosaurus.

1186
00:57:00.533 --> 00:57:05.800
We've got a leg bone here
and then another leg bone
up there.

1187
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:11.100
And one is significantly
smaller than at least one
other one.

1188
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.240
So. the smaller one
was probably a juvenile.

1189
00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.000
So. the smaller one
was probably a juvenile.

1190
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.266
[Ronan] <i>Victoria thinks</i>
<i>it's no coincidence</i>

1191
00:57:17.266 --> 00:57:20.367
that several predators are
buried together here.

1192
00:57:20.367 --> 00:57:21.634
<i>If they died together.</i>

1193
00:57:21.634 --> 00:57:25.166
<i>it may mean</i>
<i>they lived together</i>
<i>in family groups.</i>

1194
00:57:26.166 --> 00:57:29.600
<i>That raises the possibility</i>
<i>that they hunted in packs</i>

1195
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.900
<i>to take on</i>
<i>more massive prey.</i>

1196
00:57:33.734 --> 00:57:36.500
[Victoria] To take down one
of those sauropods

1197
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:40.467
would have been
incredibly difficult

1198
00:57:40.467 --> 00:57:42.700
because they're 10 times

1199
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.240
or more than the size
of these allosaurus.

1200
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.166
or more than the size
of these allosaurus.

1201
00:57:46.166 --> 00:57:49.700
So. the question is.
would the allosaurus

1202
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.266
have tried to take down
an adult?

1203
00:57:51.266 --> 00:57:53.266
And if they did.
they would probably

1204
00:57:53.266 --> 00:57:56.166
have to do it together
and work as a pack.

1205
00:58:01.266 --> 00:58:03.700
[Ronan] <i>Hunting in packs</i>
<i>would give allosaurus</i>

1206
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:09.100
<i>a much better chance</i>
<i>of bringing down</i>
<i>a 16-ton sauropod.</i>

1207
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.734

we can tell a lot.

[Ronan] <i>Larry uses</i>
<i>a CT scanner to look</i>
<i>inside skulls.</i>

[Larry] <i>CT scanning</i>
<i>has revolutionized our field.</i>

1284
01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:20.000
but we can actually look
through the bone.

1285
01:02:27.266 --> 01:02:29.066
[Ronan] <i>The scanner</i>
<i>measures differences</i>

1286
01:02:29.066 --> 01:02:34.066
<i>in density and builds up</i>
<i>a 3D model</i>
<i>of the internal structure.</i>

1287
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.734
[Larry] We can actually work
our way back

1288
01:02:43.734 --> 01:02:45.500
to where that brain would be.

1289
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.467
And so. we can actually see
the brain cavity.

1290
01:02:51.066 --> 01:02:55.533

this really big skull.

1291

[Ronan] <i>This relatively small</i>
<i>brain cavity in a large skull</i>

1292

<i>that size isn't everything.</i>

1295
01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:16.100
So. we now know that
brain size is important

1296
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.066
and how big your brain
is relative to your body.

1297
01:03:19.066 --> 01:03:22.166
What we've discovered is that
actually the structure

1298
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.533
of the brain itself winds up
being potentially

1299
01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.040
even more important.

1300
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:26.867
even more important.

1301
01:03:26.867 --> 01:03:30.066
[Ronan] Larry wants to know
what's going
on inside

1302
01:03:30.066 --> 01:03:32.000
<i>an allosaurus' brain.</i>

1303
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.367
<i>To find out.</i>
<i>he's turning to birds.</i>

1304
01:03:36.367 --> 01:03:40.266
<i>Birds are the direct</i>
<i>descendant of dinosaurs</i>
<i>like allosaurus.</i>

1305
01:03:40.266 --> 01:03:44.867
<i>And just like their ancestors.</i>
<i>they have very small brains.</i>

1306
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:47.467
<i>But that doesn't stop them</i>
<i>from being clever.</i>

1307
01:03:47.467 --> 01:03:51.266
<i>versatile hunters</i>
<i>and even using tools.</i>

1308
01:03:51.266 --> 01:03:55.500
Birds. it turns out.
have pretty remarkable
cognitive ability.

1309
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.040
something we've discovered.
um. and really in the past
10 or 15 years.

1310
01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.533
something we've discovered.
um. and really in the past
10 or 15 years.

1311
01:04:00.533 --> 01:04:03.066
[Ronan] <i>The secret</i>
<i>of a bird brain success</i>

1312
01:04:03.066 --> 01:04:05.967
<i>is in its compact structure.</i>

1313
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:09.266
[Larry] They actually have
a huge number of neurons

1314
01:04:09.266 --> 01:04:11.266
in that brain.
but they're smaller

1315
01:04:11.266 --> 01:04:15.467
and packed together.
much more tightly than
what we see in mammals.

1316
01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:18.967
[Ronan] <i>By cramming</i>
<i>more brain cells</i>
<i>into a small space.</i>

1317
01:04:18.967 --> 01:04:20.634
they have greater
thinking power

1318
01:04:20.634 --> 01:04:22.800
than was ever
thought possible.

1319
01:04:23.967 --> 01:04:26.040
Larry's scans revealed
that allosaurus brains

1320
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:26.500
Larry's scans revealed
that allosaurus brains

1321
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.100
had some strikingly
birdlike features.

1322
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.634
We used to look
at a brain like this
and sort of say. like.

1323
01:04:32.634 --> 01:04:35.266
"Well. there's probably not
a whole lot going on here."

1324
01:04:35.266 --> 01:04:38.634
But the reality
is allosaurus probably

1325
01:04:38.634 --> 01:04:40.634
had much greater
cognitive abilities

1326
01:04:40.634 --> 01:04:43.867
than what we would have
ever thought in the past.

1327
01:04:43.867 --> 01:04:46.634
[Ronan]
<i>This could have made it</i>
<i>a sophisticated hunter.</i>

1328
01:04:47.867 --> 01:04:50.500
<i>Perhaps even capable</i>
<i>of working in teams</i>

1329
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.734
<i>to bring down</i>
<i>a 16-ton sauropod.</i>

1330
01:04:55.066 --> 01:04:56.040
[Larry] <i>Was allosaurus able</i>
<i>to solve problems.</i>

1331
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.867
[Larry] <i>Was allosaurus able</i>
<i>to solve problems.</i>

1332
01:04:57.867 --> 01:05:01.000
was it able to defeat
the defenses of...

1333
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.734
of the prey species
and be an effective predator

1334
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.734
<i>because it was smart?</i>

1335
01:05:06.734 --> 01:05:10.533
<i>Was it capable of things</i>
<i>like cooperative hunting?</i>

1336
01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:13.166
You know. 15 years ago.
we would have said.

1337
01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:14.867
"No. absolutely not."

1338
01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:16.800
But now
we're kind of going. "Maybe."

1339
01:05:18.867 --> 01:05:21.066
[Ronan] <i>Fossil evidence</i>

1356
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.500

1358
01:06:32.634 --> 01:06:33.867
[Jennifer]
It's just remembering

1359
01:06:33.867 --> 01:06:35.967
that dinosaurs are animals.

1360
01:06:35.967 --> 01:06:38.367
Because we didn't get
to observe these animals.

1361
01:06:38.367 --> 01:06:41.700
we have to use what we.
we can observe in nature today

1362
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.000

<i>American plains bison</i>

1387

[Ronan] <i>And to Jen.</i>

[Jennifer] And so. we've got

1399
01:08:36.367 --> 01:08:39.433

multiple times. or maybe
other predatory dinosaurs

1430
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.066

<i>like the cuts</i>

1436
01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:35.367
[Phil] The animal
was deliberately going
for the joint capsules.

1437
01:10:35.367 --> 01:10:36.967
It's trying to pop
the joint capsules

1438
01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:39.166
with its sharp teeth
'cause those capsules

1439
01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:42.100
are incredibly strong
and that...

1440
01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:46.367
that enables the animal
then to remove
a chunk of tail.

1441
01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:49.600
And that's fascinating.
That's not just feeding.

1442
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.840
Feeding would have bite marks
all over the vertebrae.

1443

<i>scavenging opportunity.</i>

1457
01:11:29.867 --> 01:11:33.867
<i>They expertly picked apart</i>
<i>a mountain of free meat.</i>

1458
01:11:33.867 --> 01:11:36.333
<i>left after a sauropod</i>
<i>died here.</i>

1459
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.734
<i>But if the apex predator</i>
<i>of the Jurassic</i>

1460
01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:43.333
<i>didn't kill the giant</i>
<i>herbivore. what did?</i>

1461
01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:47.734
<i>To solve this mystery</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

1462
01:11:47.734 --> 01:11:50.840

1463
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.734
<i>the team needs</i>
<i>to find evidence</i>
<i>of some other cause of death.</i>

1464
01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:57.266
<i>But with only days left</i>
<i>before the site closes down</i>
<i>for the winter.</i>

1465
01:11:57.266 --> 01:12:00.533
<i>the tough rock of the badlands</i>
<i>is holding them up.</i>

1466
01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.700
We have concrete
hard rock. where the bones

1467
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.367
have been embedded
in some of the toughest rocks

1468
01:12:07.367 --> 01:12:09.100
I've ever come across.

1469
01:12:10.266 --> 01:12:12.433
[Ronan] <i>They throw</i>
<i>everything at it.</i>

1470
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.734
[indistinct chatter]

1471
01:12:20.467 --> 01:12:20.840
[Phil] <i>Rock is winning.</i>

1472
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.867
[Phil] <i>Rock is winning.</i>

1473
01:12:21.867 --> 01:12:23.600
<i>But we have another trick</i>
<i>up our sleeve.</i>

1474
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.367
<i>and it's a rather</i>
<i>large jackhammer</i>

1475
01:12:25.367 --> 01:12:27.867
<i>which we can attach</i>
<i>to the front of the bobcat.</i>

1476
01:12:27.867 --> 01:12:29.166
[Ronan] <i>It's a risk.</i>

1477
01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:32.700
<i>Big machinery</i>
<i>can destroy fragile bones.</i>

1478
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.266
<i>but it's their only chance</i>
<i>to get at the fossils</i>

1479
01:12:35.266 --> 01:12:37.600
<i>beneath this rock</i>
<i>and potentially</i>

1480
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.367
<i>to solve the mystery</i>
<i>of the dinosaur deaths</i>

1481
01:12:40.367 --> 01:12:43.734
<i>before the season ends</i>
<i>and evidence is lost.</i>

1482
01:12:46.367 --> 01:12:50.367
<i>Phil hopes to claw back</i>
<i>precious time.</i>

1483
01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:50.840
<i>but his hope</i>
<i>doesn't last long.</i>

1484
01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.634
<i>but his hope</i>
<i>doesn't last long.</i>

1485
01:12:54.533 --> 01:12:56.967
Pieces are shaking off
of this thing.

1486
01:12:56.967 --> 01:12:59.867
It looks like
it's leaking right here.

1487
01:12:59.867 --> 01:13:01.600
So. we're losing
hydraulic fluid.

1488
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.166
Think one of
the seals is gone.

1489
01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:05.600
[Ronan] <i>The team now</i>
<i>has a big problem.</i>

1490
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.367
Let's call the bobcat place.

01:13:07.367 --> 01:13:09.533
-Oh. yes.
-I'll do it now.

1492
01:13:09.533 --> 01:13:12.100
[Ronan] <i>Until a replacement</i>

1493

1499
01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:46.967

1503
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.166
Leaking from this thread.
which I don't have a way

1504
01:14:01.266 --> 01:14:02.867
[Ronan] <i>They've had</i>

1506
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.634
So. a new part.

1507
01:14:08.634 --> 01:14:10.367
[Ronan]
<i>The vital replacement seal</i>

1509
01:14:12.867 --> 01:14:15.800
We can plug our breaker
back up over there

1510
01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.166
and get through this really
thick piece of sandstone

1511
01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:19.600
that has been causing trouble
for us for the past few days.

1512
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.166
that has been causing trouble
for us for the past few days.

1513
01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.266
[grunting]

1514
01:14:24.266 --> 01:14:25.800
[Ronan] <i>It's a big relief.</i>

1515
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.533
<i>Now the team can get on</i>
<i>with building</i>
<i>their final case.</i>

1516
01:14:33.266 --> 01:14:36.700
<i>The team has found evidence</i>
<i>here of a fast-flowing river</i>

1517
01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:41.867
<i>that may have swept some</i>
<i>of the dinosaurs</i>
<i>to their death.</i>

1518
01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:45.900
<i>And clues</i>
<i>to a deadly infection</i>
<i>that could have felled them.</i>

1519
01:14:47.367 --> 01:14:49.600
<i>They've investigated</i>
<i>whether there was a standoff</i>

1520
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:49.867
<i>They've investigated</i>
<i>whether there was a standoff</i>

1521
01:14:49.867 --> 01:14:54.433
<i>between giant sauropods</i>
<i>and a pack</i>
<i>of predatory allosauruses.</i>

1522
01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:57.800
<i>But autopsies</i>
<i>have convinced them</i>

1523
01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.967
<i>that the herbivores</i>
<i>were probably scavenged</i>
<i>after death.</i>

1524
01:15:01.967 --> 01:15:04.867
<i>So. with more</i>
<i>than a dozen dinosaur deaths</i>

1525
01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:08.166
<i>to account for.</i>
<i>how did they die?</i>

1526
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.166
<i>With the hard rock</i>
<i>now cleared away.</i>

1527
01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:18.166
<i>Phil is searching for evidence</i>
<i>of what could have killed</i>

1528
01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:19.600
<i>the sauropods.</i>
<i>if they weren't victims</i>
<i>of the Jurassic's</i>

1529
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.634
<i>the sauropods.</i>
<i>if they weren't victims</i>
<i>of the Jurassic's</i>

1530
01:15:21.634 --> 01:15:24.367
<i>apex predator. allosaurus.</i>

1531
01:15:24.367 --> 01:15:28.166
<i>And he's found a new clue</i>
<i>right next to the skeleton</i>

1532
01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:30.800
<i>of one of the giant sauropods.</i>

1533
01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.700
<i>Here. a pool of water</i>
<i>created ripples in the sand</i>

1534
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.533
<i>150 million years ago.</i>

1535
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.634
At different times in the life
of this pond. it dried out.

1536
01:15:43.634 --> 01:15:47.166
And you can see
when the water shallowed

1537
01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:49.367
that the wind was blowing
the surface of the water

1538
01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:49.600
creating these beautiful
ripple marks.

1539
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.066
creating these beautiful
ripple marks.

1540
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.533
[Ronan] <i>Phil thinks this pond</i>
<i>often shallowed out</i>
<i>in the dry season.</i>

1541
01:15:57.533 --> 01:16:00.066
<i>But that in extreme</i>
<i>dry seasons.</i>

1542
01:16:00.066 --> 01:16:02.467
<i>something more</i>
<i>dramatic happened.</i>

1543
01:16:02.467 --> 01:16:05.333
<i>The pool dried up completely.</i>

1544
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.166
And it looks like the water
continued drying up

1545
01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:11.867
to a point where we got
a cracked surface.

1546
01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:14.367
literally desiccation cracks.

1547
01:16:14.367 --> 01:16:16.467
[Ronan] <i>For Phil.</i>
<i>these faint cracks</i>

1548
01:16:16.467 --> 01:16:18.533
<i>in the mud are a vital clue.</i>

1549
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.367
[Phil] It's such
an extreme event.

1550
01:16:21.367 --> 01:16:26.000
it got incredibly hot and dry.
and this whole area dried out.

1551
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.734
This animal was looking
for the place

1552
01:16:27.734 --> 01:16:30.600
where it knew it could
find water and couldn't.

1553
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.734
And it's days ended here
in a dried out pond.

1554
01:16:36.066 --> 01:16:38.266
[Ronan] <i>Phil believes</i>
<i>he's solved the mystery</i>

1555
01:16:38.266 --> 01:16:42.166
<i>of why so many</i>
<i>sauropod skeletons</i>
<i>are buried here.</i>

1556
01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:48.266
<i>His theory is that</i>
<i>the</i> Jurassic Mile <i>was home</i>

1557
01:16:48.266 --> 01:16:49.600
<i>to a watering hole.</i>
<i>where many sauropods passed</i>

1558
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.066
<i>to a watering hole.</i>
<i>where many sauropods passed</i>

1559
01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:54.634
<i>on their way</i>
<i>between feeding grounds.</i>

1560
01:16:59.734 --> 01:17:03.266
<i>But just like an extreme</i>
<i>wet season could flood it.</i>

1561
01:17:03.266 --> 01:17:07.634
<i>an extreme dry season</i>
<i>could turn it</i>
<i>into a wasteland.</i>

1562
01:17:11.367 --> 01:17:14.367
<i>When that happened.</i>
<i>some dinosaurs arrived</i>

1563
01:17:14.367 --> 01:17:19.600
<i>too late for food and water.</i>
<i>instead finding</i>
<i>only a fetid mud pit.</i>

1564
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.333
<i>too late for food and water.</i>
<i>instead finding</i>
<i>only a fetid mud pit.</i>

1565
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.000
<i>They succumb to thirst</i>
<i>and starvation.</i>
<i>dying right here.</i>

1566
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.734
<i>And Phil believes</i>
<i>this explains</i>

1567
01:17:32.734 --> 01:17:36.266
<i>why so many allosauruses</i>
<i>were here. too.</i>

1568
01:17:36.266 --> 01:17:40.533
The carcass was rotting away
and it would have stunk
to high heaven.

1569
01:17:40.533 --> 01:17:43.100
and was probably
a signal for all predators

1570
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.166
and scavengers around
the landscape

1571
01:17:45.166 --> 01:17:47.634
and they'd have come here
for a free meal.

1572
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.166
[Ronan] <i>But for at least</i>
<i>one allosaurus. whose bones</i>

1573
01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:56.800
<i>lie a few feet</i>
<i>from this sauropod.</i>

1574
01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.100
<i>this may have been</i>
<i>the last meal it ever ate.</i>

1575
01:18:05.367 --> 01:18:08.700
<i>which leaves</i>
<i>one final mystery to solve.</i>

1576
01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.634
<i>what killed</i>
<i>this ferocious predator?</i>

1577
01:18:12.634 --> 01:18:15.433
<i>Jen may have found</i>
<i>an answer at last.</i>

1578
01:18:16.467 --> 01:18:19.600
<i>To her expert eye.</i>
<i>the bones of this allosaurus</i>

1579
01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.000
<i>To her expert eye.</i>
<i>the bones of this allosaurus</i>

1580
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.700
<i>reveal something about life</i>
<i>in the Jurassic.</i>

1581
01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:28.867
<i>It was incredibly dangerous.</i>
<i>even for apex predators.</i>

1582
01:18:28.867 --> 01:18:31.734
They're the kings.
if you will. of the Jurassic.

1583
01:18:31.734 --> 01:18:33.967
When you have
all these different animals
living together.

1584
01:18:33.967 --> 01:18:35.800
you're gonna have
different conflicts.

1585
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.066
This is the kind of world that
the allosaurus is living in.

1586
01:18:39.066 --> 01:18:41.700
[Ronan] <i>Most allosaurus bones</i>
<i>here have scars</i>

1587
01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:45.734
<i>from serious injuries</i>
<i>and infections that</i>
<i>affected them in life.</i>

1588
01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.600
<i>Just as they are</i>
<i>for predators today.</i>

1589
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.100
<i>Just as they are</i>
<i>for predators today.</i>

1590
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:55.700
<i>hunting injuries were common</i>
<i>and there was always</i>
<i>competition for meat.</i>

1591
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:59.266
Allosauruses tend
to be a pretty beat up lot.

1592
01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:01.800
You're dealing with big preys.
there's also other

1593
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.500
allosauruses and other
meat-eating dinosaurs
they have to interact with.

1594
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:09.166
they have to defend territory.
they could probably be
fighting over a mate.

1595
01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:10.800
[Ronan] <i>Sometimes.</i>
<i>these injuries</i>

1596
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.100
<i>could be very serious.</i>

1597
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.100
<i>The bones already excavated</i>
<i>from this allosaurus</i>

1598
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:19.600
<i>have made her wonder</i>
<i>if it may have suffered</i>
<i>a broken leg.</i>

1599
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:19.734
<i>have made her wonder</i>
<i>if it may have suffered</i>
<i>a broken leg.</i>

1600
01:19:21.266 --> 01:19:24.367
[Jennifer] This is where I saw
a split down the femur.

1601
01:19:24.367 --> 01:19:26.967
And so. right on what looks
to be maybe a fracture.

1602
01:19:26.967 --> 01:19:30.967
so an injury. didn't look like
it got to heal too much.

1603
01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:34.100
It was starting to heal.
but it didn't get
all the way there.

1604
01:19:35.266 --> 01:19:38.000
[Ronan] <i>With such an injury.</i>
<i>this allosaurus</i>

1605
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.100
<i>would have been</i>
<i>at a big disadvantage</i>
<i>in the hunt.</i>

1606
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.166
<i>or if challenged</i>
<i>by another large predator.</i>

1607
01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.266
[Jennifer] Probably
wasn't gonna be sprinting

1608
01:19:47.266 --> 01:19:48.500
after healthy animals.

1609
01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.600
So probably
it's scavenging. but it...

1610
01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600
So probably
it's scavenging. but it...

1611
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.367
it definitely found
a way to...

1612
01:19:52.367 --> 01:19:54.867
to live at least a couple
of weeks more.

1613
01:20:01.467 --> 01:20:05.367
[Ronan] <i>Maybe this allosaurus</i>
<i>had made its final journey.</i>

1614
01:20:06.467 --> 01:20:09.367
<i>Attracted here</i>
<i>to feast. injury.</i>

1615
01:20:09.367 --> 01:20:13.700
<i>mud and ferocious rivals</i>
<i>may have proved too much</i>

1616
01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.634
<i>and it died right next</i>
<i>to its last meal.</i>

1617
01:20:18.367 --> 01:20:19.600
<i>As the season changed</i>
<i>and the rains returned.</i>

1618
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.500
<i>As the season changed</i>
<i>and the rains returned.</i>

1619
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.166
<i>its remains were lost</i>
<i>below the water.</i>

1620
01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:28.100
<i>Predator and prey</i>
<i>entombed together</i>

1621
01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.433
<i>for 150 million years.</i>

1622
01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:41.266
<i>Jen has found</i>
<i>this crucial evidence</i>
<i>in the nick of time.</i>

1623
01:20:41.266 --> 01:20:44.100
<i>It's the last day</i>
<i>of the summer's dig season.</i>

1624
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.600
<i>Phil and the team are wrapping</i>
<i>and protecting</i>
<i>any exposed bones.</i>

1625
01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.533
<i>Phil and the team are wrapping</i>
<i>and protecting</i>
<i>any exposed bones.</i>

1626
01:20:54.734 --> 01:20:56.867
[Phil] Don't have it taut.
Remember?
There should be no...

1627
01:20:56.867 --> 01:20:58.000
Yeah. no tension.

1628
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.967
[Phil] No... no...
That's it. No tension.

1629
01:20:59.967 --> 01:21:02.000
[Ronan] <i>Until they return</i>
<i>next year.</i>

1630
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.800
<i>they want all evidence</i>
<i>to be safe against</i>
<i>the harsh Wyoming winter.</i>

1631
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.266
[Phil]
<i>You're protecting the fossils</i>

1632
01:21:08.266 --> 01:21:09.634
from the extreme
weather conditions

1633
01:21:09.634 --> 01:21:11.166
that persist here in winter.

1634
01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:15.166
<i>can get down to -37 or more.</i>
<i>it's pretty terrifying.</i>

1635
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.867
[Ronan] <i>There are still</i>
<i>some major finds to cover.</i>

1636
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.333
[Phil] There's so much bone
that's been exposed.

1637
01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:34.600
This is the last day.
everyone's stressed.

1638
01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.166
[Ronan] <i>So.</i>
<i>it's all hands on deck.</i>

1639
01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:38.800
[Bill] We just. we want
a few longer ones

1640
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.266
just so we can wrap them
absolutely all the way around.

1641
01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:42.800
It makes it stronger.

1642
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.600
[Ronan] <i>And with one</i>
<i>final push. time is up.</i>

1643
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.734
[Ronan] <i>And with one</i>
<i>final push. time is up.</i>

1644
01:22:07.533 --> 01:22:12.800
<i>At the Children's Museum</i>
<i>of Indianapolis.</i>

1645
01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.000
<i>the completed</i>
<i>dinosaur skeletons</i>

1646
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.600
<i>from the</i> Jurassic Mile
<i>are finally resurrected</i>
<i>after 150 million years.</i>

1647
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.233
<i>from the</i> Jurassic Mile
<i>are finally resurrected</i>
<i>after 150 million years.</i>

1648
01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:26.467
[Jennifer] <i>Dinosaurs</i>
<i>are so bizarre.</i>

1649
01:22:26.467 --> 01:22:28.266
They're the closest things
we have to like

1650
01:22:28.266 --> 01:22:30.166
mystical beasts.
but they're real.

1651
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.166
[Ronan] <i>For those left</i>
<i>in the ground.</i>

1652
01:22:33.166 --> 01:22:36.433
<i>silence will return</i>
<i>for another long winter.</i>

1653
01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:39.734
<i>But the team will be back.</i>

1654
01:22:39.734 --> 01:22:42.100
I think the <i>Jurassic Mile</i>
will yield

1655
01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:47.867
hundreds of dinosaurs over
the next 20. 30. 40 years.

1656
01:22:47.867 --> 01:22:49.600
[Ronan] <i>They may have</i>
<i>solved this particular</i>
<i>murder mystery.</i>

1657
01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.266
[Ronan] <i>They may have</i>
<i>solved this particular</i>
<i>murder mystery.</i>

1658
01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:56.700
<i>But this extraordinary place</i>
<i>has many more secrets</i>
<i>to unearth.</i>

1659
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.867
I've been very lucky
to chase dinosaurs

1660
01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:01.967
around the globe
for the last 30 years.

1661
01:23:01.967 --> 01:23:06.166
but I've never found
a site like this one.

1662
01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:10.900
I mean. it... it could keep
100 paleontologists busy
for 100 years.

1663
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.800
[Ronan] <i>For many years</i>
<i>to come.</i>

1664
01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.100
<i>this remarkable site</i>
<i>will continue</i>

1665
01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:19.000
<i>to give these scientists</i>
<i>a unique window</i>

1666
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:19.600
<i>into a long lost world.</i>

1667
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600
<i>into a long lost world.</i>

1668
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.467
<i>The</i> Jurassic Mile
<i>is dinosaur country.</i>
