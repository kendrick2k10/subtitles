ALARM

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.538
Yes. motherfucker. yes!
Let's go. Victoria!

6
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.998
What is it. Vicky?

7
00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:04.750
I got an email from Cloudsystems.

8
00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.710
They chose me as head of programming.

9
00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:07.711
Are you kidding?

10
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:10.589
No. this is my best moment.

11
00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:11.966
Vicky. Victoria.

12
00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.468
Video conference in half an hour.

13
00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.637
-Didn't you see it?
-I hadn't.

14
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.056
VICENTE
CALLING

15
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.392
The phone is ringing. Give it to me.

16
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.685
But I just sat down.

17
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:25.521
-Vicente is calling.
-What?

18
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.357
-Vicente.
-Hi. Vicky. how are you?

19
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.193
I'm busy. I'm going to a meeting.
What's up?

20
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:32.987
I'm heading over in five.

21
00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.780
Over where?

22
00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:37.074
What do you mean?
Your house with the kids.

23
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.117
Why?

24
00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:41.161
My God. Vicky. have you forgotten?

25
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:43.414
Yes. No. I remember perfectly.

26
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.166
You're going to Panama.
The kids are staying here.

27
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.377
You could've told me through WhatsApp.

28
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.547
I've been sending you messages
the past three weeks.

29
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.093
Yes. I saw them. but couldn't they stay
at your mom's house?

30
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.178
My mom died last year.

31
00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:03.434
That was a low blow. I'm sorry.
You never got along with her.

32
00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.812
Remember when she asked you
for money and then played dumb?

33
00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:11.609
It's four days. Unless you don't want
your kids to stay with you?

34
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.194
Of course I do.
They're my kids. I love them.

35
00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:17.573
I was waiting for them.
I thought they'd come earlier. but...

36
00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:21.243
I have everything ready.
I'm waiting for them. Come whenever.

37
00:03:21.327 --> 00:03:25.289
Remember. Julián is having problems
at school. I told you that.

38
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.584
Yes. I know. in biology.
He doesn't understand mitochondria.

39
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.755
-Math. Vicky.
-That's right. math. the hypotenuse.

40
00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.798
It's all good. I'll take care of it.

41
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:38.344
Before you hang up.
please limit their screen time.

42
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:41.221
-They're addicted.
-We're on the same page.

43
00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:43.015
No screens. I'll take care of it.

44
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.892
-Okay.
-Relax. Bye.

45
00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.811
-Vicky. can I ask you something?
-Yes.

46
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.273
Who's taking the kids to school?

47
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:55.527
Uber. Easytaxi. Cabify...
I don't know. DiDi. Beat...

48
00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:56.862
Who will cook for them?

49
00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:01.450
PedidosYa. Glovo. Uber Eats...
I don't know. Cornershop...

50
00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.534
Homework?

51
00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:06.914
For homework. there's Wikipedia. Google.
YouTube. Duolingo. TED Talks.

52
00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:09.458
-I can relate to you.
-Really?

53
00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:11.585
I had a horrible mom too.

54
00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:15.965
I'm not a horrible mom. Ángela.

55
00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:20.761
I'm a modern mom. which is different.
Really. I know about situations like that.

56
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.555
My dad was awful to me.
He made my life impossible.

57
00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.183
My relationship
with Vicente was awful as well.

58
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.851
He always acted superior

59
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.396
because he was successful
and earned money.

60
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.066
He rubbed it in your face.
belittled you because he's an asshole.

61
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.860
Victoria! By God! I can hear you!

62
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:41.657
But a good asshole. A good dad.
Just so that it's clear.

63
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.535
He's always been a great dad
and I appreciate that.

64
00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.620
I'd love to tell you that more often.

65
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:48.455
Okay. bye.

66
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:53.293
Bye? Where are you going? The meeting
is in 20 minutes. Let's tidy up.

67
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:55.045
I'm just stopping by.

68
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.756
Ángela. you've been here for two years.

69
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.678
If you need me. I'm on my phone.
Instagram. Messenger. Facebook. DM.

70
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.648
Dear. cheer up.

71
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.403
There is absolutely nothing I can do.

72
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.710
Please. it's four days.

73
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.630
Four days will fly by.

74
00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:44.803
It's your mom. by God.

75
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.904
put your thumb up.

76
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.782
Perfect. great.

77
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.873
Vicky Gallo in Chilean.

78
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.086
Don't worry. I speak Spanish too.

79
00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.963
Good. I was getting all sweaty. Good.

80
00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:23.467
This opportunity is wonderful.
I have many abilities.

81
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.512
I'm responsible and organized.
Organization is my thing.

82
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:30.349
You know we demand
a high level of commitment. right?

83
00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:34.478
You will have it. As a programmer.
my commitment is at 100%.

84
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.816
The other candidate told us
the same thing. that she's available 24/7.

85
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.487
There's another candidate?
Well. I'm more available. 26/7.

86
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:47.282
Victoria. what's up?
Does Ángela still live here?

87
00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:51.453
-She doesn't want to share her room.
-I told you I wanted the bed on top.

88
00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:55.958
I'm in a meeting. Leave. please.

89
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.127
I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.546
Don't worry.
I know what having kids is like.

91
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.465
They're not mine.
They're my niece and nephew.

92
00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:05.300
Let me mute myself for a second.

93
00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:12.307
I am busy in an important meeting. Out!

94
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:16.728
Leave. we'll sort this out later.
Close the door nice and hard.

95
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.649
There we go. So sorry.

96
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:26.822
Okay. the final decision will be conveyed
today at 9:00 p.m. Chile time.

97
00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.867
You'll receive an email
stating the chosen programmer.

98
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.910
At 9:00 p.m. I'll be on standby.

99
00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:35.038
I'll do more than that.
I'll be checking all the time.

100
00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.291
Sounds good. I'll log off now.

101
00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:40.169
It's a saying. I never log off.

102
00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:44.464
I'm online 28/7. Okay. thanks. bye.

103
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:52.890
-Hey. come on.
-No.

104
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:57.728
You look great! I love having you here.
I've been waiting for you for weeks.

105
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:02.024
I was ordering everything.
I put a blouse on. all for you! Hugs!

106
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:06.737
You're big all over. Big curls. big head.
big size. everything.

107
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.864
Wait. I just have to put
a name here...

108
00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.991
VICKY HAS CREATED THE GROUP "4 DAYS"

109
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.911
There. I made a Whatsapp group
so we can be connected.

110
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.164
"Okay. Mom." I love hearing you guys.

111
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.709
Send me an emoticon.
even if it's just a wink.

112
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.923
The first rule
of this house goes like this...

113
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.180
Exactly. there's nothing
because there are no rules in this house.

114
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.478
Mom is cool! Mom is awesome!

115
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:43.398
I know! There are no rules.
You can use your cell phone all you want.

116
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:46.109
If they run out of battery. no problem.

117
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.238
there are chargers here.
there. in the bedroom. everywhere.

118
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.282
Chargers. may nothing go uncharged.

119
00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.409
Mom. did you change the Wi-Fi password?

120
00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:58.038
Yes. now it's "You messed up
if you want to steal my Internet."

121
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.167
Messed with a capital M. okay?
Look. come to the bedroom.

122
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.756
-It's not working.
-Steal is with an S.

123
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.635
Got it.

124
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.764
Well. here is your bedroom.

125
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:19.351
Don't worry. Ángela will sleep with me.
That's how it goes.

126
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:21.687
Hey.

127
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.273
-Who is that?
-Move your legs!

128
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.276
-Victoria. so rough!
-How heavy!

129
00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:30.320
There are the beds.
Who will sleep in which one?

130
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.572
-Me up top!
-No. I sleep up top!

131
00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:35.325
-I said it first!
-But I'm 15 and you're 9.

132
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:39.371
-That's a three year difference.
-The math thing is true.

133
00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:40.497
-What?
-Nothing.

134
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.339
Victoria! Where do I put my clothes?

135
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:52.301
It's four days. Keep them in your bag.

136
00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.094
I have a walk-in closet at home.

137
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.639
You have it here too.
It's not a walk-in. but you have a closet.

138
00:09:57.723 --> 00:09:58.557
Yeah. yeah.

139
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.102
But the walk-in part
is walking over. Walking.

140
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.687
How will we get to school?

141
00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:06.940
YOUR BICYCLE HAS BEEN UNLOCKED!

142
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.568
Here. These two here are unlocked.

143
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.029
Have a nice day.
I love you. See you later.

144
00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.448
-You're not coming?
-Me?

145
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.783
I'm not prepared. I don't have shoes on.

146
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.494
I have to work.
I have to deliver a website.

147
00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:21.413
We don't know how to get to school.

148
00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.124
What is GPS for? Why does it exist?

149
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.545
Okay.

150
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.631
I'll go with you. But only this once.

151
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.508
It's very easy. You'll see.

152
00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:35.969
You put the school's name in the GPS...

153
00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:37.095
What's it called?

154
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.890
-Santa Cecilia.
-Santa Cecilia.

155
00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.018
Just kidding! How would I not know?

156
00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.936
It's written on the seal. Obviously.

157
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.647
There it is. Santa Cecilia.

158
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.274
No humor. We'll work on that.

159
00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:52.194
-I'll grab this. Those are yours.
-I call this one.

160
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:31.400
For lunch. buy something at the stand.

161
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:32.317
I have no money.

162
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:33.944
Tell them you'll pay tomorrow.

163
00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.362
-I love you.
-Bye.

164
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.781
Ma'am! Good morning. Julián.

165
00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.032
Are you his mom?

166
00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.201
-You are...
-Alejandra.

167
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:42.953
Alejandra...

168
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.455
Your son Julián's teacher.

169
00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:47.791
Yes. the teacher. You're new. right?

170
00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.209
No. I've always been here.

171
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.504
I don't know if you're aware

172
00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:55.257
of how poorly he's been doing
in math all year long.

173
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.969
Yes. I got the note.
I signed the notebook.

174
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.512
We sent an email.

175
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.224
By email. I meant
I signed it electronically.

176
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.518
I'm aware. but it's not that serious.

177
00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.687
Who hasn't had problems with math?

178
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.689
And he's young. He's 10 years old!

179
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:11.982
I'm 9 years old.

180
00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.694
See how good he is with numbers?
He's attentive.

181
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:19.865
As we said in the report.
your son has only gotten bad grades.

182
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.285
The final exam is coming.
If he fails. he'll repeat the year.

183
00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.453
The whole year?

184
00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:28.373
Yes. he'd fail the entire year.
not just part of it.

185
00:12:28.457 --> 00:12:30.709
In fact. I'm concerned.

186
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:35.338
The best app for math is Math Professor.

187
00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.048
And we're downloading it.

188
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.718
So. hashtag. we'll turn this thing around.

189
00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:46.099
You think Julián will do better
in math with an application?

190
00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:47.309
It all adds up.

191
00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:50.562
Since we're talking about math.
it all adds up.

192
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.106
-I get it.
-I'll see you in the afternoon.

193
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.902
You're in your best moment.
You look your best.

194
00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.320
Right now. Take care.

195
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:21.468
-Victoria.
-Vicky.

196
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.719
-Pizza.
-Thank you.

197
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.679
Wait. Five stars. Better than a tip.

198
00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:29.226
-Victoria?
-Vicky.

199
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.394
-Sushi.
-Thank you. Five stars!

200
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.396
I don't know if the tempura is warm.

201
00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:48.203
Please pass the ketchup?

202
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.376
Ketchup. please.

203
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:03.760
Hey.

204
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.099
What an enriching chat. but I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

205
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.184
Get some rest. Brush your teeth.

206
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:17.691
That's a lie.
She's going to look at her inbox.

207
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.569
Ángela. I'm in that group too.

208
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.823
ÁNGELA WAS REMOVED FROM THE GROUP

209
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.366
You removed me!

210
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.492

Are you coming to Arica?

214
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.719
Yes. well...

215
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:50.473
I'd love to. But it's hard to get there.

216
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.226
You'll miss the big party.

217
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:55.687
Yes?

218
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.692
And when would that be?

219
00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.320
Next month. Think about that.

I don't know. looks like it's down.

I'm checking. I'll restart the router.

There. it's back. No. it's not.

What's up? There's no Internet.

229

I'm trying to figure it out.

It's like it's dead.

Mine neither. dear.

Can't you see my email won't open.

-Dammit!
-Damn. we're screwed.

No. we're not. Let's calm down.

Let's breathe. It's all good.
Ángela. go look for candles.

236
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:04.381
When did we buy candles?

237
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.174
Okay. put them on the list.

238
00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.636
It's back! We're good. It's back.

Ask the neighborhood chat
if anything happened.

242
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:19.521
There's no Internet.
so I don't have Whatsapp.

243
00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:20.897
I don't have it.

244
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.441
It's all good.
I'll go talk to the neighbors.

245
00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.611
See you later. Calm down.

Hi. I'm from apartment 75.
Do you have Internet?

247
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.245
Hi. Can you ask your mom
if you have Internet?

248
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.707
Hi. I'm your neighbor. Internet?

249
00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:42.544
Oh. hi. Victoria.

How are you? Do you have Internet?

252
00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:49.801
No.

253
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.553
Neither do we.

254
00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.514
It seems like no one on this floor does.

255
00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.558
No. I've never had it.

256
00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.227
-Never?
-Never.

257
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.938
-Never ever?
-Never ever.

258
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.941

It seems that all
the geostationary satellites

263
00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.293
stopped working
because of a solar eruption.

264
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:07.337
which has caused irreparable damage

265
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.672
to the lines that provide Internet.

266
00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:14.969
Professor. we know
the last big solar storm was in 1859.

267
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.763
But this one is far worse.

268
00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.056
What happened?

269
00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:22.769
How will this explosion
affect life on the planet?

270
00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:26.689
Well. life will be severely disrupted.

271
00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:32.362
The television still works.
but the Internet. which is basic. doesn't.

272
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:36.491
Cellphones are out of reception.
They don't work.

273
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.243
So now I'm disconnected.

274
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:40.745

275
00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:44.290
all flights. domestic and international.

276
00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.625
are cancelled.

277
00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.460
Dad won't be able to come back.

278
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.504
We repeat.

279
00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.924
The entire planet has been left
without Internet indefinitely.

280
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.141
Mom? Mom!

281
00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.184

Mom!

283
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.604
What?

284
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.154
Excuse me.

285
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.623
It's like a video game.

286
00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:28.167
All this because of the Internet?

287
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.379
Yes. we're back to the dark ages.

288
00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:32.380
Careful.

289
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.728
Out of the way. Excuse me.

290
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:47.645
What's going on?

291
00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.856
I don't know. The bank is closed.

292
00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:55.069
Excuse me. Careful. Excuse me.

293
00:19:58.573 --> 00:19:59.908

294
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.993
Go. go. go.

295
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.369
Excuse me.

296
00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.872
Excuse me.

297
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.210
Hey! It doesn't even work!

298
00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:15.340
We have to leave. Here comes a taxi.

299
00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.884

300
00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:21.095

301
00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.643
Here comes another. Taxi. Taxi!

302
00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.064
-Get in.
-Wait. Do you have cash?

303
00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:34.275
How would I have cash
if there are no ATMs working?

304
00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.526
What's your deal?

305
00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.696
Let's walk. Let's go over there.

306
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.031
Don't leave my side.

307
00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:49.374
No. not here. Let's go over here.

Shit. there's no Internet.

309
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:06.683

00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:41.778
Careful.

312
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:46.282
-Let's go over here.
-No. Victoria.

313
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.910
-Yesterday we went left.
-This is another way.

314
00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:51.996
Careful. Stay close and hurry up.

315
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.167
Everyone together. okay? Careful.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.127
There. Don't fall behind. Julián.

317
00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:00.922

318
00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.689
This isn't it. This isn't school.

319
00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:20.399
It's a short stop. okay?

320
00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:22.568
No. What's your deal? No. sorry.

321
00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:24.445
We're still using it.

322
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:26.322
Find another one.

323
00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.866
Don't let go of them. Bring the bikes.

324
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.577
-Where are we going?
-Just a quick stop.

325
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:33.663
Then we'll go to school.

326
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.206
Excuse me.

327
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:36.749
Why isn't this line moving?

328
00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.292
The cards don't work.

329
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:40.837
Let's go. Sorry. they're waiting for me.

330
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.754
You can't.

331
00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:43.965
Excuse me. sorry.

332
00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:45.174
Without touching.

333
00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:47.969
There are many people waiting
and bikes don't fit.

334
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:50.680
-Let's use the stairs.
-Excuse me. Careful.

335
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:52.515
It's not a lot. How many?

336
00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:55.268
-Fourteen floors.
-We have to go 14 floors?

337
00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:56.644
I'm not going up.

338
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.864
There were 19. not 14.

339
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:10.116
Nineteen! We're here!

340
00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:13.369
You complained about 14.
Imagine if I had told you 19.

341
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:14.912
Yeah. I would've complained.

342
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.043
Come here. Wait for me two seconds.

343
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.091
Where did you get that bike?
Do you have Internet?

344
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:29.802
No. I broke the lock.

345
00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:34.682
My name is Victoria Gallo.
I am a programmer.

346
00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:37.059
And I've been chosen
as head of programming.

347
00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:38.978
We have no information here.

348
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:41.731
Well someone must have information.
I don't know.

349
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:45.693
Who is she?

350
00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.236
The head of communications.

351
00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:52.575
-Susana.
-Don't speak to me.

352
00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:56.454
-Hello. Cloudsystems?
-Yes.

353
00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:58.206
Hi. I'm Raquel. I'm a programmer.

354
00:24:58.289 --> 00:25:01.250
And I've been chosen
as the new head of programming.

355
00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:04.879
Hi. I'm Victoria. I'm the other candidate.

356
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.634
-The other one.
-Yes. the other one.

357
00:25:09.717 --> 00:25:10.885
Excuse me.

358
00:25:14.805 --> 00:25:16.974
Excuse me. who can we speak to?

359
00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:18.476
The chief of staff.

360
00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:20.186
Where is his office?

361
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:22.438
There. you can stand in line if you like.

362
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:27.485
-The tone is back. What do I do?
-Call 103.

363
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:29.570
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

364
00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:31.530
-I'd like to ask...
-Yeah. me too.

365
00:25:31.614 --> 00:25:33.324
But I asked first. Mine is short.

366
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.785
Who is the new head of programming?

367
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.412
The info is in an email
you sent last night.

368
00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:41.624
You'll have to wait
for the Internet to come back.

369
00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:44.502
If it comes back.
I'm going to talk to Ricardo.

370
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:45.711
-Ricardo?
-Yes.

371
00:25:45.795 --> 00:25:48.297
Excuse me. who is Ricardo?
Maybe he can help.

372
00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:55.012
Clara? Julián?

373
00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:56.430
Clara?

374
00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.892
Clara? Julián?

375
00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:02.853
Clara! Julián!

376
00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:04.563
Clara!

377
00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.288
Clara! Julián!

378
00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:25.418
Clara! Clara! Julián!

379
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.921
Hey. stop!

380
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:31.465
Stop! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

381
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:32.883
-To Dad's house.
-Why?

382
00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:34.135
What do you mean "Why"?

383
00:26:34.218 --> 00:26:36.721
Look around. The world has gone to shit.

384
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:38.389
And all you care about is work.

385
00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.683
It was for a bit. Now we'll go to school.

386
00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:42.435
How will we go to school now?

387
00:26:42.518 --> 00:26:44.353
-Why not?
-Because it's late.

388
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:48.274
You're left without Internet.
We're left without a mom.

389
00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:52.361
No. sorry. Your nephew and niece.
according to you.

390
00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:54.530
You're exaggerating. We're even then.

391
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.991
You never call me mom
and I gave birth to you.

392
00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:59.785
-It's the only thing you did.
-That's not true.

393
00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:03.247
I pay attention to you and what you do.
I "like" all your posts.

394
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:06.834
Mom. we love you.
not your likes or any of that.

395
00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:08.627
I didn't know you didn't like it.

396
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:11.464
You didn't tell me.
I won't "like" anymore. No more.

397
00:27:11.547 --> 00:27:14.717
There's no Internet.
How could you give me a like?

398
00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:18.637
Okay.

399
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:20.931
We're stressed. Let's calm down a bit.

400
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.601
We'll go to the store
and buy something delicious.

401
00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:26.270
We won't go to school
because it's way too late.

402
00:27:26.354 --> 00:27:28.564
We'll talk about it at home. Okay?

403
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:29.982
-Okay.
-Okay.

404
00:27:34.945 --> 00:27:37.448
Let's go. It's getting very dangerous.

405
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:39.575
Let's go somewhere safer.

406
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:45.873
Julián. careful. No. Get down.

407
00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:47.500
Excuse me. What's going on?

408
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:49.835
The cards aren't working.

409
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:52.421
So you have to take everything
without paying.

410
00:27:53.964 --> 00:27:56.175
Lucho. let go of that. It's vegan.

411
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.011
Meat.

412
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:02.390
-Lucho. bring some wine.
-White or red?

413
00:28:02.473 --> 00:28:04.725
Whichever. I'll be in the parking lot.

414
00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:09.814
Okay. Let's go to the dairy section.

415
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:11.774
I'm lactose intolerant.

416
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.194
You're too young to be so intolerant.

417
00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:16.487
But I eat tofu.

418
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.280
But tofu isn't food.

419
00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:19.532
Grab whatever. Quickly.

420
00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:21.909
You go for breakfast foods.
I'll get dairy.

421
00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:24.829
-Stay together.
-Julián.

422
00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:27.206
Mine. mine.

423
00:28:36.257 --> 00:28:37.842
Leave that!

424
00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.093
Sorry.

425
00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:41.387
I'm not stealing.
I have no problem paying.

426
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.391
But the cards don't work.
I'll put everything back. Here.

427
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.396
I'm missing cheese and milk. Thank you.

428
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:55.818
-Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm okay.

429
00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:58.904
I'll take the cheese
because it's the last one.

430
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:02.074
The milk is yours. Give me the cheese.
I saw it first.

431
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:04.118
Tie your shoes or else you might fall.

432
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.494
Okay. thanks.

433
00:29:13.127 --> 00:29:14.211
Faster.

434
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.258
I love coming to the grocery store!

435
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:20.676
Yes. it's good.

436
00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:40.738
MAIL LOADING

437
00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:44.158
YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED

438
00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:59.715
I never thought I'd be without
Internet this long.

439
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:03.886
Me neither. Two days seems like a ton.

440
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.471
I've never not had Internet.

441
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:08.224
I never thought Internet could run out.

442
00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:09.975
And how will you go to school?

443
00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:12.102
We have a way. but I can't tell you.

444
00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:14.188
We stole some bikes. Look.

445
00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:18.651
Bye! Have a good day!

446
00:30:18.734 --> 00:30:20.486
I gave you lunch. Julián.

447
00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:22.696
A can of tuna with a can opener.

448
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.906
Kisses!

449
00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:35.960
Victoria!

450
00:30:40.214 --> 00:30:41.590
Careful! Excuse me!

451
00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:15.874
FACE TO FACE
NOTIFICATIONS

452
00:31:15.958 --> 00:31:21.672
Multiply by negative 2. that gives us
a total of negative 34.

453
00:31:22.256 --> 00:31:24.466
The numerical operation goes like this.

454
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.094
Negative two. open parenthesis.

455
00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:28.721
five plus. open parenthesis.

456
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:30.347
four. open parenthesis.

457
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:32.057
six minus. open parenthesis.

458
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:35.769
two to the power of four
minus one. close parenthesis.

459
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:37.855
divided by three. close parenthesis.

460
00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:40.399
minus. open double parentheses.

461
00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:43.235
square root of nine.
plus seven. close parenthesis.

462
00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:45.279
divided by ten. close parenthesis.

463
00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:48.490
times eight. close parenthesis.
Very simple.

464
00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:51.243
So. negative two. open parenthesis.

465
00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:53.037
Five plus four plus eight.

466
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.123
Why? Because I bring down the five.
Four times one. four.

467
00:31:56.206 --> 00:31:57.499
And the eight goes here.

468
00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:00.002
Since they're negative.
the answer is positive.

469
00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:02.838
And. for that. five plus four
plus eight gives us 17.

470
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.715
And we multiply that by minus two.

471
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:07.760
This gives us a total of minus 34.

472
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:08.969
Do you understand?

473
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:12.431
Negative two. open parenthesis...

474
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:22.316
I want to know what's going on
with Clara. but she won't talk.

475
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:23.233
There?

476
00:32:23.317 --> 00:32:25.444
Yes. a little lower. There.

477
00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:27.863
I don't know.
maybe it's because of her crush.

478
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.240
-What crush?
-Tommy.

479
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:31.825
Tommy who?

480
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:33.243
The surfer.

481
00:32:33.327 --> 00:32:36.830
-What surfer?
-Her admirer.

482
00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:39.625
I think she's sad
because she can't talk to him.

483
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:42.211
Why didn't she tell me?
She doesn't talk to me!

484
00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:44.880
I'm lucky to get her
to answer my audio messages.

485
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:47.966
There. Send her an audio message.

486
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.843
We don't have Internet. How?

487
00:32:49.927 --> 00:32:51.929
-Can we change the subject?
-Okay.

488
00:32:52.012 --> 00:32:55.349
I left a bowl.
so people can pin things here.

489
00:32:55.432 --> 00:32:57.267
For example. here.

490
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:59.353
I NEED A MATH TEACHER
URGENT: APT 75

491
00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:01.647
This too. That. there.

492
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.565
Like a notification. so people know.

493
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:05.150
What time do the kids get out?

494
00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:06.985
At 3:00. Why?

495
00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:10.239
No. no reason. Since it's 3:05.

496
00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:13.534
Shit!

497
00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:19.039
-Vicky!
-What?

498
00:33:19.123 --> 00:33:20.666
-The bike!
-Shit!

499
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:22.543
It's here.

500
00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:28.924
Sorry!

501
00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:31.760
Sorry. I was running late.
I had no way to tell you.

502
00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:34.096
Let's go before the teacher shows up.

503
00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:36.140
Finally! Are you okay?

504
00:33:36.223 --> 00:33:39.184
Yes. We're running late. yes. Let's go.

505
00:33:39.268 --> 00:33:41.562
I'm worried about your son.

506
00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:44.732
Julián was a disaster today in geometry.

507
00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:49.486
Geometry. It depends what angle
you look at it from.

508
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.448
Think about that. Let's go. It's late.

509
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:53.991
Bye. teacher!

510
00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:56.160
Bye.

511
00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:59.621
Don't leave the bikes.
You have to bring them.

512
00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:01.540
Who moved the sign?

513
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.876
Excuse me.

514
00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:04.793
There.

515
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:08.046
-Are you from apartment 75?
-Yes.

516
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.798
You need math classes?

517
00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:11.675
-You know who can help you?
-Who?

518
00:34:11.759 --> 00:34:13.927
Rigoberto. from apartment 77.

519
00:34:14.011 --> 00:34:16.680
The owner of the hardware store
around the corner.

520
00:34:16.764 --> 00:34:20.267
My grandson was about to fail
and he saved him.

521
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.228
Now he's an engineer and lives in Toronto.

522
00:34:23.312 --> 00:34:24.605
Toronto. Canada.

523
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.067
Can I help you. dear?

524
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:32.112
No. it's fine.

525
00:34:32.196 --> 00:34:33.113
Slowly but surely.

526
00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:37.659
Engineer?

527
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.830
1967.

528
00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:44.833
The Math Olympiad in Buenos Aires.

529
00:34:44.917 --> 00:34:46.585
The boy on the right is me.

530
00:34:47.377 --> 00:34:49.505
I didn't know there was a Math Olympiad.

531
00:34:49.588 --> 00:34:52.174
-There is a lot of ignorance.
-Yes. a lot.

532
00:34:54.802 --> 00:34:57.221
Math is beautiful.

533
00:34:57.888 --> 00:35:02.726
It really is. but it's very discredited
because it has gotten a bad rap.

534
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:03.644
Yes.

535
00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:08.482
I'd give anything to teach a class
in front of a crowd. Don't touch!

536
00:35:08.565 --> 00:35:13.403
They don't listen because they're
wrapped up in their phones all day

537
00:35:13.487 --> 00:35:17.241
and don't do anything
but look at their phones. Please!

538
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.535
In my time. it was drugs.

539
00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:21.620
Now it's the Internet.

540
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:26.291
They don't realize it kills brain cells.
so they do poorly in school.

541
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.627
And you know who's to blame? The parents!

542
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.214
They must take responsibility
for their children's education.

543
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:33.382
It's logical.

544
00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:34.800
Yes. that's why I'm here.

545
00:35:34.883 --> 00:35:38.136
I wanted to ask you if you could
teach math to my son.

546
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.514
No!

547
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:44.601
No. I don't have enough time.

548
00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:48.063
But just a little time. Just the basics.

549
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.606
Addition. subtraction.

550
00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.860
Multiplication. The parentheses thing.

551
00:35:52.943 --> 00:35:54.278
And division. And that.

552
00:35:55.654 --> 00:35:57.114
What is the boy's average?

553
00:35:57.781 --> 00:35:59.533
The boy has an average

554
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:01.535
of 3.55.

555
00:36:02.995 --> 00:36:05.372
And math drives him crazy.

556
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.458
Well. then I can't say no.

557
00:36:09.334 --> 00:36:10.377
-Really?
-Yes.

558
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.964
Thank you. Rigoberto.
I really appreciate it.

559
00:36:14.047 --> 00:36:17.217
Hey. your apartment is very beautiful.

560
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:19.928
It's like being in a museum.
It has so much...

561
00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:22.556
-You have a landline!
-Of course.

562
00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:24.099
-Does it work?
-Don't touch!

563
00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:25.559
-Sorry.
-Of course it does.

564
00:36:25.642 --> 00:36:27.978
I used to have carrier pigeons.
but they died.

565
00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:29.521
A cat ate the last one.

566
00:36:30.314 --> 00:36:31.523
Really?

567
00:36:31.607 --> 00:36:33.400
No. It's a joke.

568
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:52.127
-You like a surfer?
-Damn. Ángela. what a loud mouth.

569
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.254
No. I swear it wasn't your cousin.

570
00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:55.505
Then who was it?

571
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:58.216
Me. my maternal instinct. I'm your mom.

572
00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:02.095
I'd like to talk.
so that I know what's going on with you.

573
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:04.556
You've never given me advice in person.

574
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.144
The only thing you do is send messages
with excuses or some dumb meme.

575
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.314
Okay.

576
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:27.120
Hi. Clarita. it's your mom.
and I'm sending you this to ask what's up.

577
00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:30.165
What are you doing?

578
00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:34.127
Hi. Clara. it's me again.

579
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:38.966
You don't need to answer me.
but I want you to know you can trust me.

580
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:41.093
Kisses.

581
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:43.762
Is there anything more ridiculous?

582
00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:49.226
Hi. Clara. I'm very excited
to receive your message. I love it.

583
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.478
Even though you find it ridiculous.

584
00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:52.938
but I...

585
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:57.275
I want to know who you like.
What's going on with this boy?

586
00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:59.403
I want to talk with you. dammit.

587
00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:00.821
Give me a chance.

588
00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:05.283
Even if it's a test period. a free trial.
a seven-day subscription.

589
00:38:05.367 --> 00:38:07.536
If you don't like it. you get a refund.

590
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:10.080
This is a quick message.
so don't speed it up.

591
00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:11.415
Kisses. bye.

592
00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:22.175
Hi. Vicky.

593
00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:27.681
Look. I'm leaving you this message

594
00:38:27.764 --> 00:38:30.267
to tell you I met someone on Instagram.

595
00:38:32.394 --> 00:38:34.980
He's a surfer. He lives in Arica.

596
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:40.485
His name is Tommy.

597
00:38:41.611 --> 00:38:44.072
And... I don't know!

598
00:38:44.156 --> 00:38:45.323
He's cute.

599
00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:49.911
He's cute and...

600
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:51.997
And I like him.

601
00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:54.124
I like him a lot.

602
00:38:55.292 --> 00:38:57.461
But I haven't spoken to him.

603
00:38:57.544 --> 00:39:00.255
I haven't heard from him
since the Internet crashed.

604
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:04.342
And. I don't know. the truth is

605
00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:06.386
that makes me very anxious.

606
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:11.183
Clara. I'm very excited
to receive your message.

607
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:13.769
Two thumbs-up emojis.

608
00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:16.271
I also have some things to tell you.

609
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.148
Open-eyed emoji.

610
00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:21.818
First. Julián is taking classes
from our neighbor

611
00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:24.696
who has a landline. Phone emoji.

612
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.867
I imagine the Arica Surf Association.
surfboard emoji.

613
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.746
also has a landline. and perhaps
they could contact your friend.

614
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:34.289
Closed-eyed emoji.

615
00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:37.375
If you'd like. we could find out.

616
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:39.836
I have to go now. Kisses.

617
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.758
Three kissing face emojis.
And then a red heart.

618
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.761
Should I close the door?

619
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.597
No.

620
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.515
Leave it open.

621
00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:23.547
I'm coming.

622
00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.551
Dear. why the long face?

623
00:40:27.634 --> 00:40:30.387
You told the man I had an average of 5.5?

624
00:40:31.221 --> 00:40:32.722
He doesn't want to teach me.

625
00:40:32.806 --> 00:40:35.517
No. I told him 3.5.

626
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.103
And that I'm crazy about math?

627
00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:43.024
He misinterpreted me. I said "crazy"
in a bad way. not a good way.

628
00:40:43.108 --> 00:40:46.528
Maybe it's because he's old
and he doesn't hear well.

629
00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.113
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

630
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:49.990
He went to the hardware store.

631
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.576
I'll go to the hardware store.

632
00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:57.664
And I'll go now. I'll talk to him
and tell him everything. Now.

633
00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:03.503
So. Mr. Luis. what do you need?

634
00:41:05.422 --> 00:41:07.591
Do you remember my aunt Zenaida?

635
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.010
-Yes. of course.
-My aunt.

636
00:41:10.093 --> 00:41:11.511
A very good friend of yours.

637
00:41:11.595 --> 00:41:15.015
Yes. my aunt.
She was like my mother. She...

638
00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:17.601
And what about your mom? Where is she?

639
00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:18.852
She passed away.

640
00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:22.230
I don't believe you. How?
She was doing so well.

641
00:41:22.314 --> 00:41:24.316
-Yes.
-So she wasn't doing so well.

642
00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:26.109
-What do you need?
-That.

643
00:41:26.193 --> 00:41:27.736
She left me a box.

644
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:31.573
A box about this big.
but with many details!

645
00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:34.367
-Some little things here and there.
-Did it break?

646
00:41:34.451 --> 00:41:37.913
No. And it has some...

647
00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:39.831
-Some drawers.
-No.

648
00:41:39.915 --> 00:41:41.041
Compartments.

649
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:45.837
And. look. this thing
fell off of one of them.

650
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:49.549
-The handle? To open it?
-Yes. that thing.

651
00:41:49.633 --> 00:41:52.093
-I have handles.
-You do?

652
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.722
He's talking to me.

653
00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:57.807
Look. here they are.

654
00:41:57.891 --> 00:42:00.227
There are two black ones.

655
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.187
-Two white ones.
-He does a good job.

656
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.689
Of course. I'll take these then.

657
00:42:04.773 --> 00:42:05.815
That's all.

658
00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:08.109
Thanks a lot. Put it on my tab.

659
00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:10.987
-Yes. I'll put it down.
-See you later. Take care.

660
00:42:11.071 --> 00:42:13.365
I'm working. I'm selling things here.

661
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:14.908
I've come to buy.

662
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.953
-What have you come to buy?
-I've come to buy...

663
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:19.079
This. I'll take it.

664
00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:20.163
That's not for sale.

665
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:25.043
Rigoberto. I lied.
I know I shouldn't have.

666
00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.920
I admit it. I'm sorry.

667
00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:28.755
Julián hates math.

668
00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:32.467
If he had to choose between math
and eating glass. he'd eat glass.

669
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.262
I'm not making this up.
He really did tell me that.

670
00:42:36.096 --> 00:42:38.181
And what kind of a mom are you?

671
00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:43.561
One who knows she was wrong.
who recognizes that.

672
00:42:43.645 --> 00:42:46.815
and has come to beg
for another opportunity.

673
00:42:48.692 --> 00:42:49.734
I'm not interested.

674
00:42:59.953 --> 00:43:02.789
Leave me alone to my work. please.

675
00:43:02.872 --> 00:43:06.001
Please. Rigoberto.

676
00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:07.919
Fix things with your son first.

677
00:43:10.046 --> 00:43:11.423
I don't live with my kids.

678
00:43:12.632 --> 00:43:15.802
Their father won custody
of them several years ago.

679
00:43:16.678 --> 00:43:18.096
And rightly so because...

680
00:43:19.556 --> 00:43:20.932
Because I'm a disaster.

681
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:26.438
I now have a real chance to help Julián

682
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:28.857
and I don't want to waste it.

683
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:34.029
-Candy?
-No. thank you.

684
00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:36.573
You reject my candy?

685
00:43:37.907 --> 00:43:39.617
-No. I want one.
-Too late.

686
00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:47.167
What if I help you in the hardware store?

687
00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:50.295
Yes. we'll barter.

688
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.339
What do you mean?

689
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.007
It's an exchange.

690
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.301
We both do something for each other.

691
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.970
I know what it means.
But what will we barter?

692
00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:01.056
We'll barter time.

693
00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:04.184
You'll spend a few hours helping Julián.

694
00:44:04.267 --> 00:44:07.520
and in exchange.
I'll spend many hours here helping you.

695
00:44:08.897 --> 00:44:10.565
You're not cut out for this job.

696
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.817
-Because I'm a woman?
-No.

697
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:15.904
This job is about relating to clients.

698
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:18.823
and you can't even relate to your kids.

699
00:44:18.907 --> 00:44:20.325
Give me a test period.

700
00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:22.285
Let's do a seven-day trial.

701
00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:24.829
Like a streaming platform subscription.

702
00:44:25.705 --> 00:44:26.915
Yes. that may work.

703
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:29.417
If you don't like it. the deal is off.

704
00:44:29.501 --> 00:44:33.088
I'll never bother you again.
You won't have to talk to me.

705
00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:34.839
But I can start now.

706
00:44:34.923 --> 00:44:37.258
I have immediate availability.

707
00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:38.468
What do you say?

708
00:44:45.558 --> 00:44:46.518
No.

709
00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:54.651
What do you mean "no"?

710
00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:03.910
I NEED SOMEONE TO BUY MEDICINE.
APARTMENT 71

711
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:06.788
Because it's already been seen.

712
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.873
I don't know who's idea it was...

713
00:45:08.957 --> 00:45:12.377
There you go. Mrs. Lucila.
They're all there. except this.

714
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.920
But they'll have it tomorrow.

715
00:45:14.003 --> 00:45:17.382
Thank you so much. sweetie. God bless you.

716
00:45:17.465 --> 00:45:19.551
If you need anything. let me know.

717
00:45:19.634 --> 00:45:22.595
I need one for anxiety.
but I don't have a prescription.

718
00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:25.181
Those have a red star. so I can't get it.

719
00:45:25.265 --> 00:45:26.850
But if you get it. I'll buy it.

720
00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:33.398
ALARM

721
00:46:04.012 --> 00:46:07.223
TODAY 11 AM AT THE HARDWARE STORE

722
00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:09.851
Most customers come to talk.

723
00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:11.519
-You have to talk.
-You told me.

724
00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:13.605
I understand. You told me many times.

725
00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:15.273
Don't worry. I'll do it.

726
00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:17.650
You think you can handle it on your own?

727
00:46:17.734 --> 00:46:20.487
Relax. I've got this.

728
00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.989
I'm at my best and full of energy. Look.

729
00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:24.073
Yes. two what?

730
00:46:24.157 --> 00:46:26.951
-No. not two. V for Victoria.
-For Victoria.

731
00:46:27.577 --> 00:46:29.871
-So you can do it then?
-Yes.

732
00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:30.830
Yes.

733
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:33.958
-Good luck.
-Okay.

734
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:45.428
Now then. Julián.

735
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:50.016
Why do you want to study math?

736
00:46:51.184 --> 00:46:52.352
So I don't flunk?

737
00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:58.900
Yes. that's right.
It's good for not flunking.

738
00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:02.779
But it's also good
for developing intelligence.

739
00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:05.240
to sharpen critical thinking...

740
00:47:10.078 --> 00:47:10.912
Shoes.

741
00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:11.829
Julián!

742
00:47:12.622 --> 00:47:14.874
Are you interested in understanding math

743
00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:17.085
or this is just about passing the class?

744
00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:19.337
Passing the class.

745
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.423
Okay.

746
00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:35.228
MATH FOR DUMMIES

747
00:48:01.337 --> 00:48:02.880
-Hello.
-Hello.

748
00:48:02.964 --> 00:48:05.216
-How are you?
-Good. thanks.

749
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.011
How may I help you? What do you need?

750
00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:09.596
Honestly.

751
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.265
I need a husband.

752
00:48:13.308 --> 00:48:16.019
Yes. but I'm asking
about the hardware store.

753
00:48:16.102 --> 00:48:19.606
Since we're in one.
do you need anything from here?

754
00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:20.607
Paintbrushes.

755
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.150
I like that green one.

756
00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:24.402
-Do you want to see it? You want it?
-No.

757
00:48:24.485 --> 00:48:26.613
I was just saying I like it.

758
00:48:26.696 --> 00:48:30.199
Same with the screwdrivers. all by size.

759
00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:32.243
So pretty!

760
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:33.328
Do you want one?

761
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:38.291
The color discs are so pretty.

762
00:48:38.374 --> 00:48:40.835
One. two. three. four.
There are eight. nine.

763
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.003
You want to see one?

764
00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:44.339
No. what would I do with one of those?

765
00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:48.635
Do you like talking to customers?

766
00:48:48.718 --> 00:48:49.927
I love it.

767
00:49:22.585 --> 00:49:24.045
Mr. Rigoberto. I'm here.

768
00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.464
Okay. come in.

769
00:49:27.215 --> 00:49:28.299
Come in.

770
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:35.807
My sister is here. She wants a favor.

771
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.726
Yes. what is it about?

772
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.813
Hi. yes. it's just that...

773
00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:43.856
I have a friend who is very sick.

774
00:49:44.399 --> 00:49:47.110
And I wanted to know
if I could use your phone.

775
00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:49.696
-Of course. it's right there.
-Yes?

776
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:50.905
Thank you.

777
00:50:03.084 --> 00:50:04.752
Excuse me. how do I dial?

778
00:50:06.379 --> 00:50:09.340
That's a walkie-talkie
from the war of 1940.

779
00:50:09.424 --> 00:50:12.343
The phone is the other one.
the greenish one below.

780
00:50:12.427 --> 00:50:13.302
Okay.

781
00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:22.937
Did you bring your homework?

782
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.188
Yes. it's here.

783
00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:26.774
Okay.

784
00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:29.110
Let's see.

785
00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.250
Wrong.

786
00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:55.178
Wrong. Wrong. No.

787
00:51:03.519 --> 00:51:06.856
This sum here is right.

788
00:51:06.939 --> 00:51:10.026
-Really?
-Good. good!

789
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:11.277
There's hope.

790
00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:16.032
Wrong. Wrong.

791
00:51:16.115 --> 00:51:17.700
I don't think it works.

792
00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:21.120
What do you mean?

793
00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:27.668
Yes. one moment.
Someone will speak to you.

794
00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:31.339
It seems like your friend's better.
Your friend is at a surf club.

795
00:51:34.509 --> 00:51:35.426
Thank you.

796
00:51:40.681 --> 00:51:41.724
Hello?

797
00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:44.727
Hello!

798
00:51:47.188 --> 00:51:48.856
What are your abilities?

799
00:51:50.024 --> 00:51:55.571
Advanced level of Illustrator.

I also work with Google Calendar.

802
00:52:03.454 --> 00:52:04.956
Can you start today?

803
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.375
-Today?
-Yes.

804
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:09.544
-Now?
-Yes.

805
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:15.174
-We're all from the same line of work.
-Really?

806
00:52:15.258 --> 00:52:20.555
Yes. the busgirl over there created a code
to avoid bank scams. The best.

807
00:52:20.638 --> 00:52:21.889
Now she dries dishes.

808
00:52:23.266 --> 00:52:25.768
-And what did you do?
-Me? An influencer.

809
00:52:25.852 --> 00:52:27.770
Thousands of followers. Millions.

810
00:52:27.854 --> 00:52:29.564
-Millions?
-Tons of sponsorships.

811
00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:31.232
I didn't pay for anything.

812
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:33.442
-What a shame.
-Now I pay for everything.

813
00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:34.402
Right.

814
00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:36.404
Table number seven wants the bill.

815
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:37.321
Okay. Coming.

816
00:52:38.197 --> 00:52:39.824
-Cristina.
-Yes.

817
00:52:40.533 --> 00:52:41.659
Which is table seven?

818
00:52:45.204 --> 00:52:47.832
Cristina. can you come in tomorrow?

819
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.585
It happens to be my day off.

820
00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:52.628
In the afternoon?

821
00:53:21.616 --> 00:53:22.617
MATH FOR DUMMIES

822
00:53:23.284 --> 00:53:24.911
HARDWARE STORE FOR DUMMIES

823
00:53:29.415 --> 00:53:33.002
Did anyone say ice cream?
One for you and one for you.

824
00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:45.431
It's good.

825
00:53:45.514 --> 00:53:47.433
Ángela. can you cut the onion?

826
00:53:47.516 --> 00:53:50.144
Are you crazy? I'm on my break.

827
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.771
-I'll help you.
-No.

828
00:53:51.854 --> 00:53:54.106
No. Mr. Rigoberto. sit down.

829
00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:57.151
-Can I get you something? Water?
-Wine.

830
00:53:57.234 --> 00:54:01.280
And now... Los Auténticos Decadentes!

831
00:54:01.364 --> 00:54:03.115
I love this song!

832
00:54:05.201 --> 00:54:10.039
I don't know what happens to me
When I'm with you

833
00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:15.711
Your smile hypnotizes me
Your stare disarms me

834
00:54:15.795 --> 00:54:18.214
And there's nothing left of me

835
00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:22.468
I melt like ice in the sun

836
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:24.512
If you're going to sing. I'm leaving.

837
00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:26.639
I didn't lend you the radio for that.

838
00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:31.227
When we go somewhere I never choose

839
00:54:31.352 --> 00:54:35.940
Because all I want is to go with you

840
00:54:36.941 --> 00:54:41.278
I live to follow you

841
00:54:41.362 --> 00:54:46.409
Like an abandoned dog
That follows you in the street

842
00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:47.576
Say something!

843
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:52.039
But I'm not your prisoner
And I don't have a robot's soul

844
00:54:52.123 --> 00:54:57.628
There's just something about your face
That I like and it took my heart

845
00:54:57.712 --> 00:55:01.841
I'm not your prisoner
And I don't have a robot's soul

846
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:07.513
There's just something about your face
That I like and it took my heart

847
00:55:08.222 --> 00:55:13.019
It took. it took. it took my heart

848
00:55:13.102 --> 00:55:17.690
It took. it took. it took my heart

849
00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:23.070
It took. it took. it took my heart

850
00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:26.365
It took my heart

851
00:55:26.449 --> 00:55:28.409
It took. it took my heart

852
00:55:29.035 --> 00:55:30.077
Good!

853
00:55:33.205 --> 00:55:35.750
-Want help?
-Everything is ready.

854
00:55:37.752 --> 00:55:40.880
-Are you crying?
-No. the onion is very strong.

855
00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:44.091
It's so strong.

856
00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:51.057
Silvita. is the broken socket
where you plug the lamp in your room?

857
00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.267
No. the lamp in the living room.

858
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.936
The one you bought
on your honeymoon in Paris?

859
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.188
Yes. that one.

860
00:55:57.271 --> 00:56:00.357
I can't believe it! That's a gem! Yes.

861
00:56:00.441 --> 00:56:05.112
This is the standard one.
but this old porcelain socket is better.

862
00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:06.781
-They are very sturdy.
-Okay.

863
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.492
I don't know if I have change.

864
00:56:09.575 --> 00:56:12.119
Don't worry. You can pay me later.

865
00:56:12.203 --> 00:56:14.955
-I'll mark that down.
-Thank you. Vicky.

866
00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:17.583
-I'll be back if I need anything.
-Of course.

867
00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:20.503
You'll have to come back now.
You left your package.

868
00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:23.255
-What package?
-The socket. That's why you came.

869
00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:26.675
-That's why you came.
-Okay.

870
00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:29.512
Vicky. I have to talk to you.

871
00:56:29.595 --> 00:56:30.721
Did you grab a number?

872
00:56:32.014 --> 00:56:33.682
You need to grab a number.

873
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.186
-No one's here.
-We're strict about that.

874
00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:40.106
When it's your turn. we'll talk.

875
00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:42.733
Nine?

876
00:56:44.068 --> 00:56:44.985
Ten?

877
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:47.154
-Eleven?
-Eleven!

878
00:56:48.114 --> 00:56:49.448
How may I help you?

879
00:56:49.532 --> 00:56:53.536
Some colleagues from the café
gave me confidential information.

880
00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:55.830
-What kind?
-The motherfucking kind.

881
00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:57.456
-I'm listening.
-Okay.

882
00:56:58.374 --> 00:57:02.044
It seems as if one of the satellites
survived the solar explosion

883
00:57:02.128 --> 00:57:05.089
and is sending Internet signals
to several places.

884
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:07.341
-Motherfucker!
-I told you!

885
00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:09.677
Wait. let me tell you where.

886
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.887
-Where?
-Up north!

887
00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:14.223
-In what part?
-In Belén.

888
00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:16.976
-Where Jesus was born?
-I said the same thing!

889
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:19.770
Belén is there! Next to Arica!

890
00:57:19.854 --> 00:57:21.564
There it is!

891
00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:25.860
I can't believe it. It's a divine signal.
It's wonderful.

892
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:28.529
The star of Belén is guiding us.
Jesus' star.

893
00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:31.782
Why do you want to connect?
What's in it for you?

894
00:57:31.866 --> 00:57:33.117
Certainty. Ángela.

895
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.743
I've had uncertainty for days.

896
00:57:34.827 --> 00:57:38.122
I want... No. I need to know
if they gave me the job.

897
00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:40.040
Okay. where is Santiago?

898
00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:42.126
-Here.
-Santiago is here.

899
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:46.046
Then we will go... Arica. Belén.

900
00:57:47.006 --> 00:57:49.341
That's like 2.500 kilometers to the north?

901
00:57:49.425 --> 00:57:52.761
How will you go? Flights are canceled.

902
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:56.932
"ANITA"
HARDWARE STORE

903
00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:59.935
Let me see. This!

904
00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:03.189
I have this for special occasions.

905
00:58:03.314 --> 00:58:07.526
Yes. I'm so happy you knocked on my door.

906
00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:13.199
You've helped me with the hardware store
and you've done me an even bigger favor.

907
00:58:13.282 --> 00:58:14.742
Having me teach Julián.

908
00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:18.913
Because for an old man.
well. a mature man like me.

909
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:22.625
feeling useful is what's most important.

910
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:23.876
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

911
00:58:35.346 --> 00:58:36.347
Is it very strong?

912
00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:41.352
No. it's fine.

913
00:58:45.314 --> 00:58:47.942
I also want to thank you. Rigoberto.

914
00:58:48.025 --> 00:58:51.487
You helping Julián
is very important to me.

915
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:52.821
-By God!
-Thank you.

916
00:58:52.905 --> 00:58:54.698
I am indebted to you.

917
00:58:54.782 --> 00:58:57.660
Whatever you may need. ask away.

918
00:58:58.494 --> 00:59:03.249
There is something I'd like to ask.
but I'll muster some courage first.

919
00:59:03.332 --> 00:59:04.458
I'm listening.

920
00:59:10.547 --> 00:59:11.632
-Vacation?
-Vacation?

921
00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:15.594
Yes. a vacation!

922
00:59:15.678 --> 00:59:18.430
Us. You guys. me. the family.

923
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:21.183
What's the destination?

924
00:59:21.267 --> 00:59:23.102
It's a surprise.

925
00:59:23.185 --> 00:59:24.478
-Arica.
-Ángela!

926
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.231
-Arica?
-Why Arica?

927
00:59:27.314 --> 00:59:30.943
Because it's pretty.
and I've never been there.

928
00:59:31.026 --> 00:59:34.321
We deserve a good vacation. and also

929
00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:38.617
because Clara will be able to visit
her surfer friend she misses so much.

930
00:59:38.701 --> 00:59:40.744
Enjoy your trip. but I'm not going.

931
00:59:40.828 --> 00:59:42.246
That's not an option. Why?

932
00:59:42.329 --> 00:59:45.749
The test is in a week
and I am not prepared.

933
00:59:45.833 --> 00:59:49.295
How so? With how much you have studied?

934
00:59:49.378 --> 00:59:51.547
I'm 70% prepared.

935
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.466
but the remaining 20% is fundamental.

936
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:58.304
Don't worry. Someone who can help you
is coming with us.

937
00:59:58.387 --> 01:00:00.597
-Who?
-Rigoberto!

938
01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.975
Ángela!

939
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.227
Rigoberto.

940
01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:14.153
-Julián?
-What?

941
01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.238
-Do you have your notebooks?
-You think?

942
01:00:16.322 --> 01:00:17.781
You don't. That's why I ask.

943
01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:19.074
-I have them.
-Good.

944
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.831
-Julián. do you have your notebooks?
-Yes. stop asking.

945
01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:31.003
You left behind your notebooks
and your books.

946
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.173
Don't bother him!

947
01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.178
Here comes Rigoberto.

948
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.432
How great!

949
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:45.517
Is this a joke?

950
01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:47.895
It's excellent.

951
01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:53.650
Wow.

952
01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:57.488
-How do you like it?
-It's excellent.

953
01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:58.822
It's a cell.

954
01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:00.616
-No!
-Yes.

955
01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:03.952
Of course. it's enclosed.
There aren't any windows. but...

956
01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:07.790
Wow.

957
01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:10.834
I don't want to travel
in a hardware store van!

958
01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:14.046
Relax. no one will find out.

959
01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:42.199
How are we doing over here?

960
01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.368
Great. enjoying the view.

961
01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.537
I can describe everything going on.

962
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.497
A red car just passed us.

963
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.500
A car passed us. Many cars passed us.

964
01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.461
We are on a bridge.
Bridge. bridge. bridge.

965
01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:56.213
A car passed on the other side.

966
01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.798
Highway. highway. truck.

967
01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:58.757
With a trailer.

968
01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:00.759
-Enough. Victoria.
-Enough. Mom.

969
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.805
You can go faster here.

970
01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:06.682
If you want...

971
01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.770
Rev up the engine. Surely it'll go faster.

972
01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:17.651
Because if you want to go fast.

973
01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:19.695
you can go fast.

974
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.738
Like a space ship.

975
01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:23.824
I feel like we're moving slowly.

976
01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:27.536
The other cars are going...

977
01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.874
The signs always say the maximum speed.

978
01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:36.044
They should put the minimum too
because it's also dangerous.

979
01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.672
It can cause rear-end accidents.

980
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.843
At a certain speed. anyone can reach you.

981
01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:46.597
Look. Did you see the turtle?

982
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.434
Shall we pass the granny walking?

983
01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:52.811
Okay. you can do it. Let's go. Rigoberto!

984
01:02:53.479 --> 01:02:54.897
No. we won't reach her.

985
01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:06.909
-Yes?
-Julián needs to go.

986
01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.160
Do you want us to stop?

987
01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:11.246
-Yes. obviously.
-Okay.

988
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.540
I'll tell Rigoberto to go faster.

989
01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.476
Excuse me!

990
01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.241
How wonderful!

991
01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:52.871
With this scenery. who needs the Internet?

992
01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.501
-Me.
-Me.

993
01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.462
-And me.
-Me too.

994
01:04:03.382 --> 01:04:05.008
So do you want to go?

995
01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:06.301
-Yes!
-Yes. please.

996
01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:08.679
Let's go then. ungrateful little shits.

997
01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.140
-There's nothing here.
-Nothing.

998
01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:13.141
Nothing.

999
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.894
To the van! Let's go!

1000
01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:19.356
What a shitty generation.

1001
01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.527
Hurry up. Toretto! Let's go!

1002
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.729
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1003
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.152
What are you looking for?

1004
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.113
My acne cream. I can't find it.

1005
01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:13.785
Are you nervous?

1006
01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.204
No. why would I be nervous?

1007
01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:18.707
I would be nervous.

1008
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.503
I'd be thinking the whole time.
"I'm going to meet the boy I like."

1009
01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:26.298
"I don't know him well. but I like him."

1010
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.924
"And if he doesn't like me?"

1011
01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:29.551
"And if he likes me?"

1012
01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:31.762
"Do I have to sleep with him?"

1013
01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:33.639
"Yes?"

1014
01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:35.974
"Do I have to start my sex life this way?"

1015
01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.103
I understand.

1016
01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:45.275
But I want to tell you
your virginity is yours.

1017
01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.736
It's your body.

1018
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.617
Men want to take advantage.
but it's not up to them.

1019
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.118
Your body is not a trophy.

1020
01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:59.247
If you are up for it.
if you like him. it's fine.

1021
01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:04.711
And if you aren't up for it.
it's also perfectly fine.

1022
01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:09.424
It's your body. It's your decision.

1023
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:11.510
Okay?

1024
01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:14.513
Okay.

1025
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.101
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1026
01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:21.019
Who wants juice?

1027
01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:22.979
-Who wants juice?
-I don't.

1028
01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:26.108
Now that we all have juice.
I'd like to make a toast.

1029
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.819
I'd like to raise a toast to our driver.

1030
01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:32.280
Rigoberto. thanks so much for everything.

1031
01:06:32.364 --> 01:06:33.782
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

1032
01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.951
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1033
01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.870
Speech. speech!

1034
01:06:38.954 --> 01:06:41.832
I'm 80 years old.
I never thought I'd travel

1035
01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.625
with such a strange family.

1036
01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.381
It's the worst idea I've had in my life.

1037
01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:54.261
-Cheers to that!
-Cheers!

1038
01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.387
Cheers!

1039
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.764
-Cheers. cheers.
-Cheers. cheers. cheers!

1040
01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:02.227
But give me the exact address.

1041
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.395
Clara?

1042
01:07:47.856 --> 01:07:49.232
Bitch!

1043
01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:56.031
We're going!

1044
01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:58.283
-What happened?
-Everything's paid for.

1045
01:07:58.366 --> 01:07:59.326

1051
01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:12.422
-I don't talk like that!
-Yes. you do.

1052
01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:13.673
He won't realize it.

1053
01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:43.870

1054

The surprise I had for you.

Which is?

1063
01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.539
It's a surprise. I can't tell you.

1064
01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:29.457
-What surprise?
-Come on. Tell us.

1065
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.252

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.194
Vicky.

1075
01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:22.946
-Vicky.
-Victoria.

1076
01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:30.036
Rigoberto is here in the back.
Both of you help me.

1077
01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.831
Rigoberto.

1078
01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:34.582
Rigoberto.

1079
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.794
Stretch your legs a little
and get some sun.

1080
01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:39.963
Your hand. There.

1081
01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.554
Mom. Mom!

1082
01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:37.812
Do you have a signal?

1083
01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.106
No. not yet.

1084
01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.858
I had it before. Now I don't.

1085
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.071
Shit. shit. shit!

1086
01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.322
Mom!

1087
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.323
Wait.

1088
01:12:49.157 --> 01:12:51.367
-Mom...
-Wait. for Pete's sake!

1089
01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:56.748
I want to leave.

1090
01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:01.336
Give me a moment.
Surely it's intermittent.

1091
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:02.796
I need a few minutes.

1092
01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:05.173
-Let's go. Victoria.
-Come on.

1093
01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:08.843
Give me a few minutes.
I'm sure the signal will come.

1094
01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:11.429
You're still a shitty mom.

1095
01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:13.306
If I was. I would have come alone.

1096
01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.518
Just five minutes.
Is that too much to ask?

1097
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.978
I only want to know if I got the job.

1098
01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:20.730
This was your surprise?

1099
01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:23.650
It's the job I've dreamed of all my life!

1100
01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:28.363
You always complained
that your dad was shitty to you.

1101
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:33.493
Congratulations. you're just like him.

1102
01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:39.999
Great! Super great.

1103
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.294
Clara!

1104
01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:45.421
Clara!

1105
01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.064
Jesús!

1106
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.109
Excuse me.

1107
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.115
-Tell me.
-Please help with the bags.

1108
01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:37.742
Yes.

1109
01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:43.790
I hope you and your beautiful family
enjoy your stay. Mrs. Victoria.

1110
01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:44.874
Thank you.

1111
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.846
Rigoberto. your room.

1112
01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.225
-And the key?
-That's it.

1113
01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:11.484
I'll leave you guys
the suite if you'd like.

1114
01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.494
We're stuck with what's left.

1115
01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:28.584
I hate to say "I told you so."
but fuck. I told you so.

1116
01:16:30.128 --> 01:16:31.838
-I want to die.
-Stop screwing up.

1117
01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.631
Don't die here. die in Santiago.

1118
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.050
I can't promise anything.

1119
01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:40.430
Can I hit the minibar?
Beléngate left me anxious.

1120
01:16:41.973 --> 01:16:43.099
See you later.

1121
01:16:51.566 --> 01:16:52.608
Wait.

1122
01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:58.781
You wanted another opportunity.
You got it and you threw it away.

1123
01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:00.742
-Rigoberto.
-Listen to me.

1124
01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:06.414
My wife. Ana. and I
always wanted to have kids...

1125
01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:09.375
It wasn't possible because. anyway...

1126
01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:11.878
And now that I see you.

1127
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.088
I ask myself again

1128
01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.341
why do some people.

1129
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:20.720
even if they are unprepared.
get to bring kids into the world.

1130
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.353
What kind of mother do your kids deserve?

1131
01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:32.857
The answer lies with you.

1132
01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:37.695
Are you sure this is the key?

1133
01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:39.781
Yes. like this.

1134
01:17:57.924 --> 01:18:01.886
Mom!

1135
01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:05.306
What?

1136
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:07.683
-Clara's not here!
-What?

1137
01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:09.185
She's not anywhere!

1138
01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:25.993
Clara!

1139
01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.249
-Clara!
-Look for her there.

1140
01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:36.003
Excuse me.

1141
01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:38.798
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen her?

1142
01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:40.967
Have you seen this girl?

1143
01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.051
She's not there.

1144
01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:56.482
This is my daughter.
Did you see her?

1145
01:18:56.566 --> 01:18:57.442
-Yes.
-Where?

1146
01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:59.402
No. I didn't see her.

1147
01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:02.280
-We could ask Jesús.
-Yes. ask him.

1148
01:19:03.281 --> 01:19:04.240
Jesús!

1149
01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:08.828
Bro! I started getting Whatsapp messages!

1150
01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.163
The Internet is up!

1151
01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:12.290
Don't tell me! Wait!

1152
01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.792
-There's Internet!
-We have Internet!

1153
01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.597
It's true. We have Internet.

1154

-She's not here.
-She's nowhere.

1159
01:19:52.163 --> 01:19:53.414
What? Did you call her?

1160
01:19:53.498 --> 01:19:56.626
Fifty times. She's not answering.
Let me track her.

1161
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.002
She must be at the party.

1162
01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:00.505

1163

You tell me now?

1166
01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:07.803
You just asked me.

1167
01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.347
How could I ask?

1168
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.807
-How would I have known?
-I found her.

1169
01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:14.769
She's there! She appeared.

1170
01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:16.979
No. Vicente! Just now.

1171
01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.775
Hello? Vicente. I'm super busy.
I'll call you later. Bye.

1172
01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:22.151
-Dad!
-Excuse me.

1173
01:20:22.235 --> 01:20:24.987
I'm not in the mood to talk
to my stupid ex-husband.

1174
01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:27.907
For the love of God. I can hear you.

1175
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:31.285
-Sorry!
-Is it that hard to hang up?

1176
01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:33.287
I don't know. I have a problem.

1177
01:20:33.371 --> 01:20:37.166
I hang up. but my fingers are short
or sweaty and it doesn't hang up.

1178
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.377
Let's worry about this first.
Clara's here.

1179
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.670
Stay with Rigoberto.

1180
01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.088
We will go look for her.

1181
01:21:04.986 --> 01:21:06.779
What's the point? There's Internet.

1182
01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:07.738
I don't care.

1183
01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:39.478
Hello!

1184
01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.022
Hello!

1185
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:43.274
I'm looking for Tommy.

1186
01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:46.360
You're not the only one.

1187
01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:48.029
Don't be mean.

1188
01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:49.655
He's around here.

1189
01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:52.783
Thank you.

1190
01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:54.994
Hey. guys! The Internet is back!

1191

-Clara.
-Hey. How are you?

1193
01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:27.318
I'll introduce you to everyone.

1194
01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.071
Guys. this is Clara.

1195
01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:33.324
She came from Santiago.
so let's give her a warm welcome.

1196
01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:35.618
Yeah!

1197
01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:40.289
Do you want something to drink? A beer?

1198
01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:42.750
A rum. a vodka. a piscola?

1199
01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:46.587
-Beer.
-Beer?

1200
01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:48.339
I'll go look for one inside.

1201
01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.082
-Damn!
-What?

1202
01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:24.709
Clara turned off her GPS.

1203
01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:26.669
But I saw where she was.

1204
01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:27.920
Excuse me!

1205
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.132
Careful!

1206
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.800
Careful!

1207
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.526
What's up?

1208
01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:53.112
-Here's your beer.
-I don't want it.

1209
01:23:53.988 --> 01:23:55.364
This is Rosario.

1210
01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:57.116
-Hi. Clara.
-Hello.

1211
01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.118
She came from Santiago to the party.

1212
01:23:59.744 --> 01:24:00.745
No.

1213
01:24:01.579 --> 01:24:04.457
No. I came to see you.
That's what we agreed on.

1214
01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:07.543
No. there's a misunderstanding.

1215
01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:08.586
What's up?

1216
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:10.296
I don't know. I barely know her.

1217
01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:14.133
You are disgusting.
Did you invite me to laugh at me?

1218
01:24:15.176 --> 01:24:18.637
You're a liar. You don't care about me.
You were fooling me.

1219
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:20.347
-Relax.
-What?

1220
01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:23.684
You invite me here
and now you won't even look at me!

1221
01:24:23.768 --> 01:24:26.479
Didn't you want to get to know me?

1222
01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:27.980
No. you misunderstood.

1223
01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.191
You know how far I traveled to see you?

1224
01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:34.528
You haven't changed.
You're the same as always.

1225
01:24:34.612 --> 01:24:36.739
-You're still an asshole.
-What?

1226
01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.616
You promised us a vacation.

1227
01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:40.284
You made us think you cared.

1228
01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:42.578
We gave you a chance. I gave you a chance.

1229
01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:45.122
-What are you talking about?
-Go to hell!

1230
01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.226
Hello?

1231
01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:07.812
Are you sure?

1232
01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:09.271
Okay. I'll be right over.

1233
01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:38.592
Mr. Rigoberto. I...

1234
01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.865
Tommy? Are you Tommy?

1235
01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:03.409
Tommy?

1236
01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.620
-Tommy?
-Are you Tommy?

1237
01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.249
Where is he? Who is Tommy?

1238
01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:11.375
-Tommy?
-Yes.

1239
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.298
Hey. are you Tommy?

1240
01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:18.382
No. he is.

1241
01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.968
-You?
-Yes. what's going on now?

1242
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:22.136
Where's Clara?

1243
01:26:23.888 --> 01:26:25.556
-Dumb chick.
-What do you mean?

1244
01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:27.641
She's my daughter. Where is Clara?

1245
01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:30.853
I don't know. She left.
I haven't seen her since.

1246
01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.605
Where's the girl. idiot?

1247
01:26:33.606 --> 01:26:35.065
She's not a girl. She's 18.

1248
01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:38.027
She's not 18. She's 15.

1249
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:41.405
So you're either a jerk or a pervert.

1250
01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:43.532
She left like 20 minutes ago.

1251
01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:46.285
I don't know her.
I don't even know who you are.

1252
01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:49.371
Stop saying that. I've always been there.

1253
01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:52.374
Perhaps I haven't been so close.
but I've tried.

1254
01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:56.754
It's always been easier
and more comfortable to live with Dad.

1255
01:26:56.837 --> 01:26:58.923
My dad left when I was little.

1256
01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:01.592
Who took care of you?

1257
01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:02.801
My mom.

1258
01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.305
Your mom!

1259
01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:07.932
Where?

1260
01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:14.355
He left a while ago. My mom said he left
in the morning and he never came back.

1261
01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:15.648
Where did Clara go?

1262
01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:17.733
I have no idea.

1263
01:27:17.816 --> 01:27:19.443
She didn't say where she went.

1264
01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:21.278
Let's go.

1265
01:27:21.362 --> 01:27:23.781
Couple of idiots!

1266
01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:25.783
Relax.

1267
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:28.744
Remember who took care of you. Your mom!

1268
01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:31.205
Assholes!

1269
01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:32.206
Relax.

1270
01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:35.334
-Walk to the hotel.
-Why?

1271
01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.962
If Clara is there.
you'll take care of her.

1272
01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:39.797
You think she'll be there?

1273
01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.675
No. but just in case.

1274
01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:45.260
Fine. but think about
where she'd feel safe.

1275
01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.682
Vicente's house.

1276
01:28:09.368 --> 01:28:10.869
Excuse me!

1277
01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.446
Excuse me. have you seen this girl?

1278
01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:48.240
Have you seen this girl?

1279
01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.576
Have you seen this girl around here? No?

1280
01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:53.746
Have you seen this girl?

1281
01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:54.663
No?

1282
01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.669
Has this girl bought a ticket here?

1283
01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.966
Has this girl bought a ticket here?

1284
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.884
No.

1285
01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:16.560
Has this girl bought a ticket here?

1286
01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.145
-Yes.
-Yes?

1287
01:29:18.228 --> 01:29:19.855
A while ago. She was with a boy.

1288
01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.774
A boy? What time does the bus leave?

1289
01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:22.941
Five minutes ago.

1290
01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:29.865
Ma'am! The bicycle!

1291
01:29:29.948 --> 01:29:31.200
Shit!

1292
01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:54.139
Sorry!

1293
01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:55.516
Get lost. idiot!

1294
01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:06.068
-Sorry!
-Crazy lady! You broke the mirror!

1295
01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:08.403
Sorry!

1296
01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:58.162
How many are there? How many? Sorry.

1297
01:31:15.554 --> 01:31:17.931
CLOUDSYSTEMS
CONNECTING YOU EVEN ON THE MOON

1298
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:21.018
Oh. shit!

1299
01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.479
Shit. something's wobbling.

1300
01:31:31.195 --> 01:31:32.321
I'm too old for this!

1301
01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.245
Shit. they're both the same!

1302
01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:38.095
Julián!

1303
01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:40.222
Clara!

1304
01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:42.474
Julián!

1305
01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:55.737
Is that Mom?

1306
01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:57.864
How could that be Mom?

1307
01:32:57.948 --> 01:33:00.409
It's really Mom. She came looking for us.

1308
01:33:24.683 --> 01:33:27.019
What's your deal? Are you crazy?

1309
01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:28.562
Clara! Julián!

1310
01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:30.272
We're here!

1311
01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:36.903
How did you know where we were?

1312
01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:38.989
I didn't know.

1313
01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:41.992
But you still found us.

1314
01:33:42.993 --> 01:33:45.620
I need you to get off the bus.
We have a schedule.

1315
01:33:45.704 --> 01:33:48.582
I know. Give me a few minutes.
It won't take long.

1316
01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.799
I've spent a lot of time

1317
01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:00.552
disconnected from you two.

1318
01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:06.224
I've lied to you.

1319
01:34:08.477 --> 01:34:10.520
I tricked you to bring you up north.

1320
01:34:12.606 --> 01:34:17.319
And it's true I denied
that you were my children.

1321
01:34:18.612 --> 01:34:20.989
Not for long. but I did it.

1322
01:34:22.324 --> 01:34:25.035
And something happened.

1323
01:34:25.118 --> 01:34:28.955
Something happened
when the Internet went down...

1324
01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:33.001
I felt that we were connected.

1325
01:34:35.796 --> 01:34:37.047
And I screwed up.

1326
01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:39.341
I screwed up again.

1327
01:34:40.384 --> 01:34:41.843
I do that. I screw up.

1328
01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:45.430
And it kills me because...

1329
01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:50.560
I feel like I'm the worst mom
that you could get.

1330
01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:57.150
But you got me the best math teacher.

1331
01:34:59.653 --> 01:35:01.279
That's not enough. dear.

1332
01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.825
It all adds up.

1333
01:35:07.661 --> 01:35:11.957
When I was your age. I was bad at math.
I think I was worse.

1334
01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:14.793
But there are certain numbers

1335
01:35:16.253 --> 01:35:17.462
that I never forget.

1336
01:35:18.839 --> 01:35:22.551
You were born at 4:42 a.m.

1337
01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.928
You weighed 4.569 kilograms.

1338
01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:26.930
A chubby baby.

1339
01:35:27.556 --> 01:35:29.433
You were 51 centimeters.

1340
01:35:30.434 --> 01:35:33.812
Your first steps were
at 11 months. 3 days old.

1341
01:35:35.397 --> 01:35:39.359
And your first word was "abuyebadaba."

1342
01:35:40.444 --> 01:35:44.030
"Abuyebadaba." I have no idea
what it means. We never knew.

1343
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.660
And I was rebellious like you. Clara.

1344
01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:50.745
More than you were.

1345
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.248
You are a great girl.

1346
01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:54.833
I...

1347
01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.628
I fought with my mom a lot too.

1348
01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:01.423
I ran away several times.

1349
01:36:02.549 --> 01:36:06.761
I messed around with guys like Tommy.
who's a jerk.

1350
01:36:07.721 --> 01:36:10.348
He's cute. but he's a jerk.

1351
01:36:13.477 --> 01:36:16.688
I know I've made a lot of mistakes.

1352
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:20.650
And I regret them all.

1353
01:36:22.569 --> 01:36:26.781
But there's something I will never regret.

1354
01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:31.912
Having the two of you.

1355
01:36:34.247 --> 01:36:37.751
You're the most wonderful things
that have ever happened.

1356
01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:44.424
And I'd love for us to be more connected.

1357
01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:48.637
Ma'am. please.

1358
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.139
Do you not realize this is important?

1359
01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:53.433
Are you guys in a hurry too?

1360
01:36:53.517 --> 01:36:55.977
-No. no.
-Thanks.

1361
01:36:56.061 --> 01:36:57.896
Thanks. This is important to me.

1362
01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:03.944
I don't know. Tell me.

1363
01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:06.696
What do you feel?

1364
01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:10.158
I want to know what's going on.

1365
01:37:15.664 --> 01:37:19.668
I don't know what happens to me

1366
01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.420
When I'm with you

1367
01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:27.092
Your smile hypnotizes me

1368
01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:29.636
Your stare disarms me

1369
01:37:35.392 --> 01:37:39.437
And there's nothing left of me
I melt

1370
01:37:41.064 --> 01:37:43.525
Like ice in the sun

1371
01:37:54.244 --> 01:37:57.998
I love you two with all my heart.

1372
01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:00.041
We know that...

1373
01:38:02.586 --> 01:38:04.004
Mom.

1374
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:13.847
And now can we go?

1375
01:38:53.053 --> 01:38:55.013
You wanted windows? Now you have them.

1376
01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:58.642
I can't see.

1377
01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:11.363
So many colors.

1378
01:39:11.988 --> 01:39:17.494
Well. yes. so... one color per side!

1379
01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:26.961
First. congratulations.

1380
01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:29.881
-Thank you!
-Because now comes the hardest part.

1381
01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:33.802
Yes. and I'm ready.
I'm glad to be a part of Cloudsystems.

1382
01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:37.722
And. like I told you. as a programmer
you can count on me 100%.

1383
01:39:37.806 --> 01:39:38.932
Perfect. thank you.

1384
01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:41.518
Mom. I'm supposed to sleep on top.

1385
01:39:41.601 --> 01:39:44.104
I'm in a meeting. Hold on.

1386
01:39:44.187 --> 01:39:49.150
I haven't introduced my kids to you.
Julián. Clara. say hi.

1387
01:39:49.234 --> 01:39:51.903
You'll understand
that they are my priority.

1388
01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:55.699
I'm happy to hear that
because here our kids are our priority.

1389
01:39:55.782 --> 01:39:58.243
Then you'll understand I have to hang up

1390
01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:02.414
because Julián has a very important test.
We're nervous.

1391
01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:04.749
Thank you very much. I'm logging off.

1392
01:40:04.833 --> 01:40:06.918
-See you soon.
-Thank you.

1393
01:40:08.336 --> 01:40:09.796
Damn. he takes his time!

1394
01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:12.173
Here he comes.

1395
01:40:17.721 --> 01:40:18.638
Excuse me.

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:20.807
-How did it go?
-Seven.

1397
01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:22.642
-Congrats! Was it hard?
-No.

1398
01:40:22.726 --> 01:40:24.561
Really? What did they ask?

1399
01:40:24.644 --> 01:40:26.229
They're giving away sevens.

1400
01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:27.230
"Seven."

1401
01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:33.069
Here he comes! Yes.

1402
01:40:51.588 --> 01:40:52.797
3.7.

1403
01:41:00.513 --> 01:41:02.056
Well. dear.

1404
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.769
in life there are highs and lows.

1405
01:41:05.852 --> 01:41:08.229
This is the latter. but...

1406
01:41:08.313 --> 01:41:11.608
But that gives me an average
of four and I pass the class!

1407
01:41:16.613 --> 01:41:18.907
And all thanks to my mom!

1408
01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:22.327
I love you!

1409
01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:25.038
In your face!

1410
01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:28.333
We're happy!

1411
01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.585
-Family celebration!
-Yes!

1412
01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:33.296
Fist bump.

1413
01:41:34.964 --> 01:41:36.341
My favorite 3.7.
