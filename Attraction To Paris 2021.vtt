Do you speak English?

No. [French language].

10
00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:28.050
Oh.

11
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.057
Just these.
Oui.

12
00:04:38.974 --> 00:04:41.019
Thank-- Merci beaucoup.

[French language].

14
00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:49.811
Excuse me. is this seat taken?

15
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:52.553
Oh. damn it.

16
00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:53.728
You dropped your book.

17
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.164
Oh. you speak English.

18
00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:57.166
Yes. of course. Doesn't
everyone?

19
00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:59.864
I feel like I'm in grade school
trying to find a seat at the
lunch table.

20
00:04:59.908 --> 00:05:01.213
You can sit with me if you like.

21
00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:02.345
Thanks.

22
00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:05.217
I haven't had anything to eat
all day.

23
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:08.830
So are you backpacking through
Europe?

24
00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:10.614
Is that a really clichÃ© thing to
do?

25
00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.921
No. It's a great way to see
Europe.

26
00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:14.531
See France.

27
00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:16.316
I still can't believe that I'm
here.

28
00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:18.840
Paris? It's so beautiful.

29
00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:21.843
Let me guess. you're an artist?

30
00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:23.714
Not so much.

31
00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:25.412
A story in the back you could
say.

32
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.936
Welcome to the club.

33
00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:30.939
Any reason why you chose art?

34
00:05:30.982 --> 00:05:33.333
You could say
it was my father's influence.

35
00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:35.900
Was he an artist?

36
00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:39.426
No. He's the CEO
of a major pharmaceutical
company

37
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.297
and a professional asshole.

38
00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:44.953
I only chose art
because I knew who wouldn't
approve.

39
00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.479
It was a good excuse
to go to the US for a few years
and study.

40
00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.526
What about you?

41
00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.093
My dad taught art history at
Penn State.

42
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.445
I would sit in on classes
from time to time.

43
00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.229
I got the bug from him.

44
00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:02.449
So we are both inspired by our
fathers.

45
00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:05.452
but in very different ways.

46
00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:08.890
When he passed away last year.
I almost gave up.

47
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.720
It took some time to get over
that
but eventually I found my way
again.

48
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.199
Your mother?

49
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:17.768
I don't remember much of her.
only glimpses.

50
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:19.422
like hazy photographs.

51
00:06:19.683 --> 00:06:21.468
She died when I was two of
cancer.

52
00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:24.514
but I wish I had more time with
her as a child.

53
00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:28.562
Astrid. we need your opinion
on something.

54
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.912
If it's how big your--

55
00:06:30.955 --> 00:06:33.001
No. nothing like that.

56
00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:35.395
Who do you think would win in a
fight?

57
00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.529
Well. you of course.
Pierre wouldn't stand a chance.

58
00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:44.142
I don't. like a descendant
of Marco Sekunden would lose to
anyone.

59
00:06:44.447 --> 00:06:47.755
The French great one.
champion of the world 1948.

60
00:06:47.798 --> 00:06:50.105
'48. I know.
You speak about him all the
time.

61
00:06:50.148 --> 00:06:53.325
The fighting genes skip certain
generation.
yours is one of them.

62
00:06:58.287 --> 00:07:00.855
I see.
who's your pretty friend?

63
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:02.813
Oh. where are my manners?

64
00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:04.772
Vivi.

65
00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:06.861
Heather. it's nice to meet you.

66
00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:08.471
Nice to meet you.

67
00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:11.169
Time for a latte?
Yes. my latte. Latte. latte.
latte.

68
00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:15.870
Sorry. Heather.

69
00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:18.263
So. American?

70
00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.049
I love Americans.

71
00:07:21.092 --> 00:07:23.747
You're more fun
than these European girls.

72
00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.621
I'm sure Heather has no interest
in you. Pierre.

73
00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:31.668
Most women find me extremely
charming.

74
00:07:32.103 --> 00:07:33.496
Most?

75
00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:36.673
Go get your own.

76
00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:38.632
Ooooh.

77
00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:39.894
I'll be back.

78
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.638
What brings you to Paris?

79
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:45.943
A vacation?

80
00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:48.206
You could say that.

81
00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:51.993
You should come out with us
tonight.
We'll show you the real Paris.

82
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.822
It'll be fun.

83
00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:57.477
You should.

84
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.002
Maybe some other time.
I'm still adjusting from the
jet lag.

85
00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:03.134
I will keep you safe. I promise.

86
00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:05.615
Who will keep her safe from you.
Pierre?

87
00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:08.488
I really should get some rest.

88
00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:10.577
Oh. come on.

89
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.405
Did you fly all the way down
here
to rest and stay locked up in
the room?

90
00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:16.278
Or did you come over
to see something new?

91
00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.324
Sometimes you just have to say
yes.

92
00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:22.502
It's going to be fun. Say yes.

93
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:26.331
Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.

94
00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.724
Yes.

95
00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:29.073
I'm in.

96
00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:30.640
Yes.

97
00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.337
To Paris.

98
00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.252
Welcome to Paris.

99
00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:35.863
Thank you.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:44.219
[music]

101
00:08:44.262 --> 00:08:46.917
Get everything finished
and call me when you're done.

102
00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:50.747
[knock]

103
00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:51.966
Come in.

104
00:08:55.273 --> 00:08:56.492
How are you?

105
00:08:58.015 --> 00:08:59.190
Surprised.

106
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:01.410
Sit down.

107
00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:06.197
Have you been sleeping?

108
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.550
No. still not sleeping well.

109
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:14.510
I'm sure you didn't call me in
here
to ask me about my sleep.

110
00:09:15.642 --> 00:09:17.252
Taking your medication?

111
00:09:17.992 --> 00:09:20.255
Still not sleeping well.
even with the pills.

112
00:09:20.298 --> 00:09:22.736
Elizabeth. what is this about?

113
00:09:24.738 --> 00:09:26.043
They want you gone.

114
00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:28.872
Who?

115
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:33.573
Look. you've done an exceptional
job
and you still do an exceptional
job.

116
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.401
except times have changed

117
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:39.013
and so have you.

118
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:45.585
I'm doing an exceptional job
and they want me gone.

119
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:47.587
Who. Elizabeth?

120
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:51.808
Those politicians who only care
about themselves and their
positions

121
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.029
or the committee?

122
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.248
I am the committee.

123
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.859
I know

124
00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:01.078
and that's why I'm saying this
to you.

125
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:04.995
In the past when you were a cop.
you wouldn't talk like this.

126
00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:08.042
Let's go get some coffee.

127
00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:13.482
Can't believe they bugged your
office.

128
00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.223
The tides have changed.

129
00:10:15.702 --> 00:10:17.138
They don't want a scandal.

130
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.838
The power between countries
has gotten really. really
difficult.

131
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:24.014
I just capture terrorists.

132
00:10:24.493 --> 00:10:29.063
You capture terrorists.
but worse. you want revenge.

133
00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:31.587
I do my job. Elizabeth.

134
00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:36.157
Look. we've been friends for so
many years
and there's times that I turn
my face

135
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.724
and I look the other way.

136
00:10:37.767 --> 00:10:40.857
You know why?
Because I know that you're
good.

137
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:43.991
but there's nothing I can do
right now.

138
00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:46.297
So. I'm out?

139
00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:50.040
They want to restructure things.
They're scared.

140
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.260
There's new terrorists now.

141
00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:55.437
They don't care
about the bombing in 2005 in
London.

142
00:10:55.872 --> 00:10:58.179
They care about the terrorist
right now.

143
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:01.661
What about Al Sawari and Abdel
Fariq?

144
00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:04.751
They're the past. They have no
power.

145
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:07.492
Nobody's interested but you.

146
00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:11.583
Oh. so you're saying the only
reason
why I have any interest in them

147
00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:13.455
is because they killed my son.
right?

148
00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:16.023
A lot of people died in London.
Elizabeth.

149
00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:20.070
They still have an active terror
cell there.

150
00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.506
I know it.

151
00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:25.554
Oh. come on.

152
00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:28.339
What did they promise you. huh?

153
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:30.907
What did they promise you
to get me out of here?

154
00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:33.823
They want your resignation on my
desk
by Friday.

155
00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:35.129
Elizabeth.

156
00:11:35.607 --> 00:11:37.131
Elizabeth. listen to me.

157
00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:39.873
I'm close.

158
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.703
Just give me a little more time.

159
00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:45.705
There's nothing I can do.

160
00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:47.619
It's politics.

161
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:49.404
There's elections.

162
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.406
You don't even like politics.

163
00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:54.975
Just move on and live.

164
00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:58.065
You know I can't live like that.

165
00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:00.502
Well. you're going to have to
learn.

166
00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:03.461
I did.

167
00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:05.594
Yes.

168
00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.598
I could see that.

Little--

175
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.868
What? No. no. no. no.
You're not going in the hostel.

176
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.739
You would never want to travel
again.

177
00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:17.090
We're going to my place.
you're going to love it.

178
00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.179
Look at how beautiful the lights
are.

179
00:15:19.222 --> 00:15:20.528
Come on. baby.

180
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:23.879

I'm sorry.
Would you mind repeating that
to me?

197
00:17:37.012 --> 00:17:38.274
I'm so sorry.

198
00:17:38.318 --> 00:17:40.450
No. wait. wait.
He's just drunk. I'm so sorry.

199
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:42.235
Just get him out of my face.

00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:44.672
Okay. fine.

202
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:51.722
I was just inviting him to a
beer.

203
00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:53.594
I'm just inviting him a beer.

204
00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:57.119
I was okay. I say. I say. I say.

205

Hey. I could have taken that
pip.

Oh my God.
Sure you could. champ.

207

You call this an apartment?
Yes.

208
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.433
This is bigger
than the house I grew up in.

209
00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:07.738
You like this place. huh?

210
00:18:07.782 --> 00:18:10.045

Yes. and that he's recognized
what I'm fighting for.

We need that detonator.

228
00:19:17.504 --> 00:19:21.725
Find Rashid. and make him
understand

Did you destroy the files yet?

I'm taking that with me.
This place is too hot.

250

I won't have time to destroy
them.

00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:23.918
Perfect. Just make sure you do.

My brother. I trust no one else.

253
00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:32.970

I'm tired.
Do you know where I can sleep?

I'm going to regret tomorrow.

How would you know?

00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:47.121
How would you regret something

267
00:23:47.164 --> 00:23:49.776
if you did not take the chance
in the first place?

268
00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:03.877

about it tomorrow.

Go to the bathroom.
Get the emergency kit and

You're okay.

We need to call the police.

336

That is not an option right now.
Here.

Pierre is dead

We call the police now and I go
to jail.

339
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.242
As simple as that.

340
00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:33.636
So you deal with your drugs
here and there.

341
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.334
Do you think they're going to
care

342
00:34:35.377 --> 00:34:37.553
when they see dead bodies
in the next room?

343
00:34:38.032 --> 00:34:40.165
Astrid. I had to make a deal
with the police.

344
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:45.431
I was looking at a couple of
years
so I had to give them Ravel.

345
00:34:45.822 --> 00:34:47.302
You sold out Ravel?

346
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.697
He owns half of Europe.
Are you insane?

347
00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.394
He has cops on his payroll.

348
00:34:52.438 --> 00:34:55.745
Yes. If he finds out where I am.
I'm as good as dead.

No.

Shit.

351
00:35:00.054 --> 00:35:01.795
What are we supposed to do now?

352
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:05.059
Just sit here
and wait for them to kill us?

353
00:35:05.581 --> 00:35:09.455
We clean up as best as we can
and hopefully you didn't think
it was Pierre.

00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:10.760
Not that gun.

00:36:35.802 --> 00:36:37.630
Okay. Okay. Careful.

371
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.893
You're okay.

372
00:36:39.936 --> 00:36:41.503
Ow. Ow. Ow.

373
00:36:41.547 --> 00:36:42.765
Come on.

374
00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:44.854
The boy. What about the boy?

00:36:46.073 --> 00:36:47.509

00:36:57.519 --> 00:36:59.260
Don't open the door to anybody.
Yes.

00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:44.670
He's going to his car.
Please calm down.

389
00:38:44.713 --> 00:38:45.845
What are we going to do?

390
00:38:45.888 --> 00:38:47.934
I can't calm down. Pierre is

Abdel is dead.

394
00:39:00.686 --> 00:39:01.991
What?

395
00:39:02.557 --> 00:39:04.298
[?].

396
00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:07.388
There is a dead kid here
with Abdel's body.

397
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.956
What about the computers? The
files?

398
00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:11.261
I don't see that.

399
00:39:11.305 --> 00:39:13.394
His desk has been wiped clean.

400
00:39:13.655 --> 00:39:14.874
Find them.

401
00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:31.978
Abdel is dead.

00:40:02.182 --> 00:40:03.444
Good morning. Elizabeth.

405
00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:04.750
Good morning. Edward.

406
00:40:04.793 --> 00:40:06.926
I thought about
what you told me yesterday.

407
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:08.710
Perfect.

408
00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:10.277
I'm not resigning.

409
00:40:12.235 --> 00:40:15.674
I understand and I knew
I was going to get this phone
call.

410
00:40:15.717 --> 00:40:17.937
The truth is. I wouldn't resign
either.

411
00:40:18.633 --> 00:40:20.156
You have until Friday.

412
00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:22.681
Good luck with the conference.

413
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:30.079
[applause]

414
00:40:30.689 --> 00:40:31.994
Thank you.

415
00:40:32.038 --> 00:40:33.518
Thank you all very much.

416
00:40:35.215 --> 00:40:37.652
Beneath The Ashes is but a
glimpse
into the world of terror.

417
00:40:39.001 --> 00:40:42.701
We've all seen the face of
terror
plastered on the news and the
internet.

418
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:47.967
but what many people don't
understand
is how often that face changes.

419
00:40:49.055 --> 00:40:51.318
No matter how many terrorists
we take down.

420
00:40:51.361 --> 00:40:53.451
another one will always arise

421
00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:56.236
until we get to the head of the
snake.

422
00:40:58.368 --> 00:40:59.935
Over the last several years.

423
00:41:02.068 --> 00:41:04.287
my research has lead to the
identity
of the top men of the London
bombings.

424
00:41:04.984 --> 00:41:08.074
Erich Hau.
his stepbrother. Abdel Fariq.

425
00:41:09.249 --> 00:41:11.904
and their leader. Omar Al
Sawari.

426
00:41:12.687 --> 00:41:17.300
Taking men such as these
takes years of hard work and
patience.

427
00:41:18.693 --> 00:41:21.087
but taking these men down

428
00:41:21.696 --> 00:41:26.309
is the only way to ensure
a total collapse of their
organization.

429
00:41:27.093 --> 00:41:29.312
Since the 2005 bombings.

430
00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:34.100
my team and I have captured or
killed
12 of 20 most wanted terrorists
on the planet.

431
00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:39.497
but when men such as these
are still breathing.

432
00:41:39.975 --> 00:41:44.197
I can only consider
the war on terror a failure.

433
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:47.287
Yes. sir.

434
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.072
Mr. Remington.
can you comment on those

435
00:41:50.116 --> 00:41:55.556
who accuse you of profiting off
of the death of those in the
London bombing?

436
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.690
I would like to make it
perfectly clear to everybody.

437
00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:01.040
and it's important to me
that you understand.

438
00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:05.610
that I do not make a profit off
of anyone's death. unlike Al
Sawari.

439
00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:08.830
All the profits from my book

440
00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:12.399
go to charities around the world
for victims of terror

441
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:18.710
and any story that says
otherwise

442
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:23.105
is just not true. and that's
that.

443
00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:25.978
Sir. there are those who argue

444
00:42:26.021 --> 00:42:28.850
that you are too focused
on the Al Sawari organization

445
00:42:29.111 --> 00:42:33.028
and that there are far more
dangerous terrorist cells
emerging everyday

446
00:42:33.289 --> 00:42:36.554
and that you should be removed
from your post at Interpol.

447
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.121
Sir. we have a situation.

448
00:42:40.296 --> 00:42:43.996
I just got a report of two
bodies
found here in a Paris
apartment.

449
00:42:44.257 --> 00:42:46.607
There were explosive devices
there as well.

450
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.915
One of the bodies
is identified as Abdel Fariq.

451
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:51.743
Abdel Fariq?
Yes.

452
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.706
Ladies and gentlemen. I'm sorry.
something has just come up and
I must leave.

453
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.143
I want to thank you all
for attending tonight

454
00:43:01.187 --> 00:43:03.102
and I appreciate everything.

455
00:43:03.145 --> 00:43:06.061
Thank you so much and please
take
a copy of my book on your way
out.

456
00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:07.149
Thank you.

457
00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:11.284
Two dead. one young kid. 20s.

458
00:43:11.327 --> 00:43:14.853
From the looks of it. he
stumbled
to something his eyes were
never meant to see.

459
00:43:14.896 --> 00:43:17.072
Abdel spots him.
quickly disposes of him.

460
00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:19.248
His prints were found
in the knife he used.

461
00:43:20.162 --> 00:43:23.078
[background noise]

462
00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:28.867
Check the evidence and report.
Okay.

463
00:43:29.824 --> 00:43:32.392
My inspector tells me
that you have a license ID.

464
00:43:32.435 --> 00:43:34.960
Correct.
The card belongs to one Olivier
Dumont.

465
00:43:35.003 --> 00:43:39.399
the other ones are three young
people
running with their bags.

466
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.227
Dumont was one of them.

467
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.230
He lives in an apartment next
door.
the broken door.

468
00:43:44.273 --> 00:43:45.579
Abdel Fariq?

469
00:43:46.058 --> 00:43:48.277
Blanche.
Yes.

470
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.066
There he is.

471
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:56.895
Puncture wound to the jugular.
he died in seconds.

472
00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:59.114
There are two types of blood.

473
00:43:59.158 --> 00:44:02.161
the second one belonging. most
likely.
to our other person of
interest.

474
00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:06.513
Can you give me a second?

475
00:44:06.556 --> 00:44:07.819
Yes.

476
00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:09.690
Thanks.

[music]

478
00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:31.886
Question is. who got to Abdel?

479
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.064
Well. Olivier Dumont
has a significant rap sheet.

480
00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:40.025
trust fund baby
of the global ex-pharmaceutical
fortune.

481
00:44:40.068 --> 00:44:42.680
French authorities brought him
in
a few years ago

482
00:44:42.723 --> 00:44:44.333
for possible drug trafficking.

483
00:44:44.377 --> 00:44:47.902
He cooperated. which led
to the arrest of the drug lord
Ravel

484
00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:50.383
and some of his runners and
enforcers.

485
00:44:50.426 --> 00:44:52.690
Dumont has been in hiding ever
since.

486
00:44:52.733 --> 00:44:54.648
Maybe you check on family and
friends.

487
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:56.171
I'll make a team on it.

488
00:44:56.215 --> 00:44:58.043
You think Dumont's funding
Abdel?

489
00:44:58.565 --> 00:44:59.566
Hard to say.

490
00:45:00.175 --> 00:45:01.786
Abdel's been here for a while.

491
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:04.614
The landlord said
he was getting ready to leave
soon.

493
00:45:11.578 --> 00:45:13.275
You've got to see this.

494
00:45:14.189 --> 00:45:15.625
They got quite the hit list.

495
00:45:15.669 --> 00:45:18.890
the Golden Gate Bridge.
the Eiffel Tower. and you.

496
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.197
Looks like I got a fan club.

497
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.900
This guy here walked in
on something he shouldn't have
seen

498
00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:30.640
so Abdel had to get rid of him.

499
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:35.123
I'm sure by now Al Sawari
has heard about his dead
commander.

500
00:45:36.951 --> 00:45:39.824
So whoever stopped this
and saved my life

501
00:45:41.477 --> 00:45:43.523
has now put their life in
danger.

Astrid. stay with her.
I'll get some water.

It's been a long time
since I've been here.

511
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:28.367
Since your divorce.

512
00:47:30.151 --> 00:47:31.457
Have you seen the brief?

513
00:47:31.761 --> 00:47:33.459
Yes. Blanche showed me today.

514
00:47:35.156 --> 00:47:36.462
They are after you.

515
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.116
You got lucky.

516
00:47:39.291 --> 00:47:41.423
I also saw your brief on Al
Sawari.

517
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.948
Al Sawari isn't done yet.

518
00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:47.647
He was going to plant a bomb
in Paris today.

519
00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:52.260
Aren't you politicians
even remotely concerned about
that?

520
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.046
They just want to paint a new
picture.

521
00:47:55.307 --> 00:47:56.874
It gives them an impression.

522
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:59.267
That's what the politicians care
about.

523
00:48:00.703 --> 00:48:02.923
You're still going to be
terminated
on Friday.

524
00:48:03.184 --> 00:48:04.577
What about those kids?

525
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.057
They're still in danger.

526
00:48:06.535 --> 00:48:08.189
You don't care about those kids.

527
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:10.235
You have so much hatred.

528
00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:13.194
I don't believe you.

529
00:48:15.544 --> 00:48:16.894
Quinoa?

530
00:48:19.679 --> 00:48:20.898
Sure.

531
00:48:22.595 --> 00:48:24.031
Can I help you?

You have to eat something.

535
00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:41.614
You lost a lot of blood.

536
00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:45.792
How are you feeling?

537
00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:49.100
I've been better. but I'm fine.

538
00:48:53.365 --> 00:48:55.323
What exactly happened this
morning?

539
00:48:57.021 --> 00:48:58.718
I found Pierre dead.

540
00:49:02.026 --> 00:49:04.332
and then.
this guy come out of nowhere.

541
00:49:05.029 --> 00:49:07.422
started chasing me
around his apartment.

542
00:49:08.902 --> 00:49:10.948
I don't even know how I killed
him.

543
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:15.648
We need to call the police.

544
00:49:15.691 --> 00:49:18.259
It was self-defense.
I didn't do anything wrong.

545
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:22.829
She's right.
Olivier. we have to call the
police.

546
00:49:23.743 --> 00:49:25.788
I didn't do anything wrong.

547
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.057
[sighs]

548
00:49:36.103 --> 00:49:37.496
Okay.

549
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.937
Toxicology report on Pierre
Chareau
came in off the charts.

550
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:46.548
Looks like he and his friends
were partying there.

551
00:49:46.592 --> 00:49:48.376
Which puts them near the crime
scene.

552
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.248
Which fills tight into your
theory

553
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:53.686
that they must've stumbled
into something they weren't
meant to see.

554
00:49:53.729 --> 00:49:55.079
Yes.
Got something else.

555
00:49:55.122 --> 00:49:57.995
A pharmacist called in
about a suspicious trio.

556
00:49:59.213 --> 00:50:01.476
Which matches
the witnesses' descriptions?

557
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.305
Yes. one of them
had several lacerations and
injuries.

558
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:05.567
I had stills in my office

559
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.569
Should be in by now.

560
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.576
See there. Olivier Dumont.

561
00:50:14.837 --> 00:50:18.145
The girl with them was ID
as Astrid Van Wyck. Olivier's
girlfriend.

562
00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:20.452
What about the injured girl?

563
00:50:20.495 --> 00:50:23.672
Hard to believe she might be
the one who encountered Abdel
Fariq.

564
00:50:23.716 --> 00:50:24.978
Yes. Right.

565
00:50:27.198 --> 00:50:29.591
There were multiple prints
at the crime scene.

566
00:50:29.635 --> 00:50:33.378
They all match to everyone else
that was there but none to our
mystery girl.

567
00:50:33.421 --> 00:50:35.336
Nobody has reported anybody
missing?

568
00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.946
No. nothing on that yet

569
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:39.862
but we did match Dumont's plates
to his Mustang convertible.

570
00:50:39.906 --> 00:50:41.255
How long till a warrant?

571
00:50:41.299 --> 00:50:43.344
I have a team working on it.
two or three hours.

572
00:50:43.388 --> 00:50:44.432
Excellent.

573
00:50:44.476 --> 00:50:45.564
Blanche here.

574
00:50:51.178 --> 00:50:52.397
Oh my God.

575
00:50:54.486 --> 00:50:56.053
Who leaked this?

576
00:50:58.098 --> 00:50:59.969
Al Sawari is one step ahead of
us.

577
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:22.035
Olivier. you need to see this.

578
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:26.431
By now. the world knows
that one of our brothers has
fallen.

579
00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:28.433
Abdel Fariq.

580
00:51:28.781 --> 00:51:32.045
I promise that there'll be
consequences
for his death.

581
00:51:32.567 --> 00:51:35.092
A retaliation from us is
inevitable.

582
00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:37.877
People will die until

583
00:51:38.573 --> 00:51:41.010
we find those responsible.

584
00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:43.752
To those responsible.

585
00:51:43.796 --> 00:51:47.713
if you're watching this.
I urge you to turn yourself in

586
00:51:47.756 --> 00:51:50.629
and spare thousands of innocent
lives.

587
00:51:51.456 --> 00:51:53.501
This is your only warning.

588
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.940
What are we going to do?

589
00:52:05.948 --> 00:52:08.255
[knock]

590
00:52:16.002 --> 00:52:17.351
Who is it?

591
00:52:17.395 --> 00:52:19.005
Private security.

592
00:52:21.312 --> 00:52:23.792
What do you want?
No one here called for
security.

593
00:52:25.446 --> 00:52:29.189
Garage door was open
so I need to check in if
everything is okay.

594
00:52:45.945 --> 00:52:47.468
Bonsoir.
Bonsoir.

595
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.778
Garage door was open
so I need to check in if
everything is fine.

596
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:54.127
Everything is fine.

597
00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:56.999
I left it open. It's my fault.

598
00:52:57.826 --> 00:53:00.351
Even though it's your fault.
I still need to check in.

599
00:53:07.967 --> 00:53:09.098
Okay.

600
00:53:13.973 --> 00:53:17.629
So. is it just you two?

601
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.371
Yes. Just me and my girl.

602
00:53:25.027 --> 00:53:31.033
[struggles]

603
00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:02.848
[gunshots]

604
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:18.472
You are okay. you are okay.
you are okay.

605
00:54:26.872 --> 00:54:28.482
Fuck.

606
00:54:30.832 --> 00:54:32.181
Shit.

607
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.230
Hey. what are you doing?

608
00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.797
I'm calling the police.
Stop.

609
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.146
Don't you get it?

610
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:42.279
They found us faster than the
police.

611
00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:44.890
Then I'm calling my father.

612
00:54:46.195 --> 00:54:47.588
What are you doing?

613
00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:50.199
Anyone looking for us
can track us through these.

614
00:54:53.942 --> 00:54:55.379
Give me your phone. Heather.

615
00:54:56.031 --> 00:54:58.382
Heather. your phone.

616
00:55:02.081 --> 00:55:03.430
We're going to Spain.

617
00:55:03.474 --> 00:55:04.953
What's in Spain?

618
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:08.740
I know a guy
who can give us some passports.

619
00:55:08.783 --> 00:55:11.482
I don't want passports.
I don't even want to go to
Spain.

620
00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:13.614
I want to call my father.
We are leaving.

621
00:55:13.875 --> 00:55:16.313
I don't know who that fucking
guy was.

622
00:55:16.356 --> 00:55:18.097
I don't know why she killed him.

623
00:55:18.663 --> 00:55:20.839
Once we get to Spain
we can call your father

624
00:55:20.882 --> 00:55:22.449
then see what he can do for us.

625
00:55:23.015 --> 00:55:24.495
but until then.

626
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.540
I don't want to die.

627
00:55:29.717 --> 00:55:31.066
so you decide.

628
00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:47.996
Looks like Al Sawari beat us
again.

629
00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.824
And yet these kids survived?

630
00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:51.652
For how long I don't know.

631
00:55:51.696 --> 00:55:54.046
They took out their GPS.
Okay.

632
00:55:55.134 --> 00:56:01.096
[music]

633
00:56:19.463 --> 00:56:25.730

[music]

638
00:57:36.104 --> 00:57:37.410
We should be here soon.

639
00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:48.769
All this is crazy.

640
00:57:50.597 --> 00:57:52.512
Hey. you said you wanted an
adventure.

641
00:57:52.556 --> 00:57:53.818
How can you say that?

642
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:55.994
Pierre is dead and I killed
someone.

643
00:57:57.604 --> 00:57:58.823
I'm sorry.

644
00:57:59.606 --> 00:58:02.000
Pierre was my friend. you know?

645
00:58:04.568 --> 00:58:05.917
I'm scared too.

646
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:10.051
Very scared.

647
00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:21.019
It's so beautiful here.

648
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.160
We should get going.
I need real food and a shower.

649
00:58:33.074 --> 00:58:34.511
Yes. a shower.

650
00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.690
You are such a jerk.

651
00:58:42.344 --> 00:58:49.003
[music]

652
00:59:31.655 --> 00:59:33.308
Is your friend meeting us here?

653
00:59:33.352 --> 00:59:35.093
No. I still need to track him
down.

654
00:59:35.354 --> 00:59:37.574
We need to stay out of sight
in the meantime.

655
00:59:45.146 --> 00:59:47.714
We have Dumont's car.
It was spotted in Spain.

656
00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.673
How quickly can we get there?

657
00:59:49.716 --> 00:59:51.631
I have a charter waiting at the
airport.

658
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.952
Commander Diaz. good to see you
again.

659
01:00:07.995 --> 01:00:11.259
You as well. my friend. though I
wish
it were under different
circumstances.

660
01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:13.348
Well. I guess we'll just never
learn. will we?

661
01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:15.568
Diaz. this is Inspector Claudine
Blanche.

662
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.701
She's been on my team now for
the last nine years.

663
01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:19.920
My pleasure.
Welcome to Spania. inspector.

664
01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.400
Thank you.

665
01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:23.489
Diaz and I.
we worked on the Madrid
bombings. yes.

666
01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:24.838
Yes. old days.

667
01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:26.623
Your police officer told us

668
01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:29.756
that they have a confirmed
sighting
of the trio on a local hotel?

669
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.151
Yes. The manager in the
establishment
identify all three suspects.

670
01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:34.761
Excellent.

671
01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:37.285
I could organize a team
to go in and secure the
suspects.

672
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:40.071
No. if we go in now.
we're going to lose Al Sarwi.

673
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.551
You're going to use them as
bait?
For now.

674
01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:47.078
This could be our best chance
at drawing out key personnel in
his network.

675
01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.691
Stay on them.
Back on the clock. everyone.

676
01:00:53.954 --> 01:01:00.047
[music]

677
01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:13.017
Fermin. mi hermano.

678
01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:15.106
It's been a long time. my
friend.

679
01:01:15.149 --> 01:01:16.629
Olivier. what's up. men?

680
01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:19.980
I know I should have called.
but I was in the area.

681
01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:22.722
These girls with you?
Yes. they're with me.

682
01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.985
We need a favor from Tadeo.

683
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:26.204
Favor?

684
01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.253
All right. let's go. This way.

685
01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:36.823
Tadeo's out back.

686
01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:44.701
Oye. guapo.
Hey. handsome.

687
01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:47.007
Â¿Tienes fuego?
Do you have a light?

688
01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:49.096
SÃ­. mamita. Para ti. sÃ­.
For you. of course.

689
01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:03.023
Gracias.
Thank you.

690
01:02:03.067 --> 01:02:04.242
De nada.
You're welcome.

691
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.900
EstÃ¡ buena. coÃ±o.
She's hot.

692
01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.645
Oh. yes. look there.

693
01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:21.215
You could put some ears
to that window.

694
01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:22.869
We're already on it.

695
01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:25.698
Carmen. if you can get closer
to the left hand window there.

696
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.960
On it. Yes.

697
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.839
She's in place.

698
01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.797
That's Carmen.
my top intelligence agent.

699
01:02:38.363 --> 01:02:39.930
We had her on the patrol nearby.

700
01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:42.193
We know she would be
the best one for the assignment

701
01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:44.021
since the area's a hotbed
for working girls.

702
01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:45.457
Come here. you fuck.

703
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.241
Whoa. Are you crazy. man?

704
01:02:47.285 --> 01:02:49.940
I should be asking you the same
thing.
What are you doing here?

705
01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:52.899
Your fucking face is all over
the TV.
and you're trying to get me
pinched?

706
01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:54.379
Sorry. I didn't know.

707
01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.164
You didn't know? You?

708
01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.907
When you kill
one of Interpol's most wanted.

709
01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:02.996
you tend to end up in the news.
Olivier.

710
01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:05.042
I didn't know what else to do.

711
01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:10.264
Here I thought
you were one of the smart ones.

712
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.311
You know what?

713
01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:17.097
I should kill you. turn your
body in.
and save a headache.

714
01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.795
All too good. [?].

715
01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:21.754
You know that guy you killed.
Abdel Fariq?

716
01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:26.019
Belongs to the Al Sarwi Network.
a big fish for the Interpol.

717
01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:28.848
Jesus.

718
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.981
Okay. I saw the bombs. Okay?

719
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.897
I thought he was just some crazy
working on his own.

720
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.855
You thought. you thought. you
thought.

721
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:39.511
and then you and these two
go inside to show yourself.

722
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.339
Good.

723
01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:43.297
Very good. Excellent.

724
01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.822
Very good. Except this one.

725
01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:49.738
They haven't been able
to identify her yet.

726
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.351
so she might be still safe
for the time being.

727
01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:56.180
What did you say your name was?
Heather.

728
01:03:56.484 --> 01:03:57.703
Heather.

729
01:03:58.399 --> 01:04:00.227

acquaintance.

731
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:08.018
Unfortunately. not for long.

732
01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:12.936
You see. if they come in here
right now
looking for the three of you.

733
01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:15.025
there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

734
01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:16.330
Here we go.

735
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.898
and we're locked in.

736
01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.204
Locked on. They're in.

737
01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:23.555
Look. I came to you
because I was desperate.

738
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.078
Okay?

739
01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:27.211
We used to do business together.

740
01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:30.214
Now. I need your help.

741
01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.520
Olivier. a lot of people
come to me for help.

742
01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.219
but nobody brings me this kind
of heat.

743
01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:38.962
For all I know. there's
a line of cops outside wanting
to bust in.

744
01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.354
There are no cops outside.

745
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:43.923
We disembarked in Paris.
and we came to you to keep it
that way.

746
01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:47.579
All we need are passports.
documents. files.

747
01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:49.581
anything to get us out of [?].

749
01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.769
I'm going to help you
with the paper work.

750
01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.162
I will.

751
01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:07.816
but only in one condition.

752
01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:11.211
after this.

753
01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:13.953
I don't want to ever see you
again.

754
01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:15.912
Okay?

755
01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:19.089
I have to turn my back on you.
Olivier.

756
01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:23.006
Once my services are rendered.
you're on your own.

757
01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:25.182
You are dead to me now.

758
01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.661
Do you understand?

759
01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:29.664
Same goes for the two of you.

760
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.670
How much will this set me back?

761
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.282
20.000 euros.

762
01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:43.940
Consider the extra tax you pay
a hazard charge

763
01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:46.290
When can it happen by?

764
01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:47.944
Come by tomorrow morning.

765
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.163
Tomorrow?

766
01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:52.383
What do you mean tomorrow?
We can all be in jail or dead.

767
01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:53.732
I'm sorry. Olivier.

768
01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.995
I just don't see
how is that any of my concern?

769
01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:58.693
You said we need to make it out
of here
as soon as possible. Tadeo.

770
01:05:58.737 --> 01:05:59.999
Wait. wait. wait.

771
01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:03.872
You want quality. that takes
time. Okay?

772
01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:06.701
This is not some kind
of fast food restaurant

773
01:06:06.745 --> 01:06:08.225
I don't know. Do you?

774
01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:09.617
Hide out. lay low.

775
01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:11.576
It's just one day.

776
01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:13.360
One day.

777
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:15.580
Fine. but we still have an
issue.

778
01:06:15.841 --> 01:06:16.973
Which is?

779
01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:21.673
I don't have any money.
but you know I can get it.

780
01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:23.501
You know how this works.
Olivier?

781
01:06:23.544 --> 01:06:25.938
It's cash upfront. or nothing.

782
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:27.984
You can find somebody else to do
it.

783
01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:32.901
How about something else in
return?

784
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:34.991
Something else?

785
01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:36.688
Well. that depends.

786
01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:45.914
Will that be enough?

787
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:54.010
You really know me well.
Olivier.

788
01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:58.362
You got yourself a deal.

789
01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:02.366
Now. if you don't mind.

790
01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:05.238
I do have some pressing matters
to attend to. so--

792
01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:16.815

All others. eyes and ears on the
three kids.

796
01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:29.045
Good job. Carmen.

797
01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:34.137
Lets just hope
your friend comes through.

798
01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:35.573
He always does.

799
01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.966
Then what? What are we going to
do?

800
01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:39.968
Go home?

801
01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:42.754
No. Well. at least not right
now.

802
01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.061
Then where?

803
01:07:45.409 --> 01:07:47.541
I don't know. Brazil. maybe.

804
01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:49.369
No extradition there.

805
01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:51.632
We can stay in Brazil
until things cool down.

806
01:07:51.676 --> 01:07:52.981
I don't want to go to Brazil.

807
01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.854
I want to go home. back to my
life.

808
01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:58.161
I don't deserve to be here.

809
01:07:58.204 --> 01:07:59.901
I didn't do anything.

810
01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:02.165
This is all her fault.

811
01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:03.731
My fault?

812
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.298
Yes. your fault.

813
01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.561
What was I supposed to do?
Let him kill me?

814
01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:11.348
Maybe. I don't know. I don't
care.

815
01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:13.176
I didn't do anything wrong.

816
01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:14.916
Astrid. you need to calm down.
Okay?

817
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.527
She did what was necessary.

818
01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.398
And because of that.
we're all going to wind up
dead.

819
01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:20.835
Stop it. Okay?
I would have done the same
thing.

820
01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:22.402
Go ahead. Stand up for her.

Do you think that I don't see
what's going on between the two
of you?

What are you talking about?
I see the way you look at her.

We have dangerous people after
us.

through your mind?

all this.

they can actually make sure
nothing happens to me.

and you're dead.

I'll take my chances.

832
01:08:49.342 --> 01:08:51.562

have him.

Do you have footage on that?

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.711
and I'm still running things
until tomorrow.

891
01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:17.148
Just keep those kids safe.

892
01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.150
I can take it. Elizabeth.

893
01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:21.152
You don't even care about the
kids.

894
01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.415
People are calling me and
complaining.

895
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.591
I have London calling. Holland.
Madrid.

896
01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:27.027
The list goes on and on.

897
01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.377
Look. the Dutch girl is fine.

898
01:14:29.421 --> 01:14:31.989
She's going to be reunited
with her father tomorrow.

899
01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.381
and I promise.

900
01:14:33.904 --> 01:14:35.514
I promise you.

901
01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:38.474
those other kids will make it
out.

902
01:14:39.126 --> 01:14:40.650
Just keep them alive.

903
01:14:41.259 --> 01:14:42.478
Alive.

904
01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:47.395
It's not their fault
that you're putting them at
risk.

905
01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:50.311
You know what?

906
01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:52.662
I kind of like that. Heather.

907
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.229
She took care of Abdel.
and she's tough.

908
01:14:55.273 --> 01:14:56.883
She'd make a great agent.

909
01:14:57.275 --> 01:15:00.321
This is not the time
for you giving recommendations.

910
01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:03.934
Tomorrow night at 6:00.
you'll be done with Interpol.

911
01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:06.066
And you can rest without me.

912
01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:09.461
Edward?

913
01:15:09.809 --> 01:15:11.115
Edward?

914
01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:45.584
[music]

915
01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:56.073
[explosion sound]

916
01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:06.518
[music]

917
01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:32.892
[music]

918
01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:54.044
It's him.

919
01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.089
Take your time.

920
01:16:56.133 --> 01:17:01.965
[music]

921
01:17:53.799 --> 01:18:00.023
[music]

922
01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:18.911
They escaped again.

923
01:18:20.652 --> 01:18:24.177
but tomorrow they pick up
passports
from one of our contacts.

924
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:30.009
[music]

925
01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.606
[foreign language] Hello.
handsome.

926
01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:29.999
How are you?

927
01:20:33.524 --> 01:20:35.831
[foreign language] Okay.
darling. And you?

928
01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:39.051
[foreign language] You know. my
days are always beautiful.

929
01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:42.402
I don't know if you noticed.

930
01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:44.665
but there aren't many people.

931
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:47.016
You should look on another
street
for work.

932
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:50.019
He's going to find her out.

933
01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:52.325
He's going to make her.
Just give her a second.

934
01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:53.805
[foreign language] Yes. I
noticed.

935
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:57.374
but my friend. Roxana.
told me this place was okay.

936
01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:02.858
unless you know someone feeling
lonely

937
01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:05.817
and in need of

938
01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:08.211
a woman like me.

939
01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:10.778
I need money.

940
01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.566
I can give you a discount
if you bring me two or three
guys.

941
01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:17.611
[chuckles]

942
01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:26.882
[foreign language] I can't. I'm
on duty.

943
01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:32.278
Find another guy.

944
01:21:32.322 --> 01:21:35.716
[foreign language] Well. your
loss.

945
01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:38.502
She is delicious.

946
01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:40.896
Work is shit.

947
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.990
In position.

948
01:21:57.477 --> 01:21:59.392
Olivier.

949
01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:02.134
your computer.

950
01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:04.441
That's not my computer.

951
01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:16.670
This is why they're after us.

952
01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:18.977
We have to go.

953
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:25.027
[music]

954
01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.513
Hey.

955
01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:40.956
[background noise]

956
01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:43.741
Go.

957
01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:50.008
[background noise]

958
01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.686
[?]. This is it. They're being
chased.

959
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.342
We have eyes on the target.
They're being chased across the
building.

960
01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:32.268
[background noise]

961
01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:35.271
Come on. jump.
No.

962
01:23:35.314 --> 01:23:36.707
We have to jump.

963
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:42.017
[background noise]

964
01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:49.807
Come here. come here.

965
01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.822
Confirm. they're coming down.

966
01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:07.172
They're coming down the fire
escape
right now.

967
01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:14.049
[background noise]

968
01:24:15.137 --> 01:24:16.355
You okay?

969
01:24:16.399 --> 01:24:20.142
[background noise]

970
01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.600
Hey. stop. Stop.

971
01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:45.384
To the wall. To the wall. To the
wall.

972
01:24:45.428 --> 01:24:47.169
[foreign language] Against the
wall.

973
01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:48.605
On your knees

974
01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:51.782
[foreign language] Hands up.

975
01:24:52.174 --> 01:24:53.653
We got the [?] under control.

976
01:24:53.697 --> 01:24:55.612
They've got them.
Can they send a photo?

977
01:24:55.655 --> 01:24:57.614
Can you send a photo across?
Yes.

978
01:24:58.005 --> 01:24:59.659
[?].

979
01:24:59.703 --> 01:25:01.400
Perfect. It's coming across now.

980
01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:06.101
It's Rashid.

981
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:09.234
[?]

982
01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.716
Yes. that's him.

983
01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:14.761
Two more.

984
01:25:19.201 --> 01:25:20.463
[door knocking]

985
01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.029
Come in.

986
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.210
Give this to the Director of
Operations.

987
01:25:32.866 --> 01:25:34.041
Stop.

988
01:25:34.085 --> 01:25:35.391
Hold up. man.

989
01:25:37.044 --> 01:25:38.089
Boss says he's on alert.
He says you might have some
heat.

990
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.395
I've got to check you.

991
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.403
Now her.
No. she's not wearing a wire.

992
01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:49.666
We just want to go in there
as quickly as possible.

993
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:52.190
If I'm not sure.
you guys get to turn around
without your stuff.

994
01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:53.496
Is that what you what?

995
01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:55.498
Okay. fine.

996
01:26:05.812 --> 01:26:08.511
I got Olivier and his girl. [?].

997
01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:11.731
Let them in.

998
01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:13.733
Copy. Let's go.

999
01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:17.694
[foreign language]. Take them.

1000
01:26:22.002 --> 01:26:23.395
On my way.

1001
01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:28.835
Yes. we can see you. Copy that.

1002
01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:33.449
Hombre. right on time.

1003
01:26:33.492 --> 01:26:35.277
Just the two of you?
Yes.

1004
01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.713
Where's the Dutch girl?

1005
01:26:36.756 --> 01:26:39.106
She's taking her chances
and going back to Holland.

1006
01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:44.242
You know there's a lot of people
from here to the Atlantic
looking for you.

1007
01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:46.113
I doubt she'd make it far.

1008
01:26:46.636 --> 01:26:49.291
Yes. well. that is her problem
now.

1009
01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:52.207
How are you two holding up?

1010
01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:56.080
Fine. considering how many times
we're almost killed.

1011
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:58.082
Coffee?

1012
01:26:59.953 --> 01:27:01.259
I love coffee.

1013
01:27:02.129 --> 01:27:04.610
Always with two spoons of sugar.

1014
01:27:05.307 --> 01:27:06.699
You have the papers?

1015
01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:08.223
Papers?

1016
01:27:09.049 --> 01:27:11.051
Yes. I got the papers.

1017
01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.228
No refunds by the way.

1018
01:27:13.532 --> 01:27:16.883
I made the Dutch girl her
papers.
so I've got to charge you.

1019
01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:19.146
It would be unlikely if you
didn't.

1020
01:27:19.886 --> 01:27:21.497
Ain't she a beauty?

1021
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:24.848
That's a 1983 [?] transmission.

1022
01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.111
You don't see one every day. do
you?

1023
01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:29.592
We really need to get going.
Tadeo.

1024
01:27:31.028 --> 01:27:33.073
Young people. always in a rush.

1025
01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:36.425
Venga. Follow me.

1026
01:27:48.001 --> 01:27:49.307
[foreign language] Hey. girl.

1027
01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:51.135
Girl.

1028
01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:53.746
[foreign language] Oh my God.
you scared me. boy.

1029
01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:57.359
I am a good girl. I won't cause
you any trouble.

1030
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.056
Listen.

1031
01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:02.146
[foreign language] I need you to
go right now.

1032
01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:04.322
Look for another place to work.

1033
01:28:05.062 --> 01:28:08.892
I promise I'll be a good girl.

1034
01:28:08.935 --> 01:28:12.896
I won't cause you any trouble.

1035
01:28:12.939 --> 01:28:14.854
This property belongs to Tadeo.

1036
01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:17.901
You understand? Move. Now.

1037
01:28:19.381 --> 01:28:21.296
Don't make me angry. Now.

1038
01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:24.777
[foreign language] Okay. I move.
You don't have to be so rough.

1039
01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:27.258
Your loss.

1040
01:28:36.615 --> 01:28:39.966
By the way. Olivier.
I made you a great Canadian
passport.

1041
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:42.621
You're now [?].

1042
01:28:42.839 --> 01:28:44.231
Something like that.

1043
01:28:46.059 --> 01:28:49.106
Heather. you're now an American
by the name of Ashley
Scarborough.

1044
01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:53.676
Of course. we have wasted
a very good work on the Dutch
girl.

1045
01:28:54.764 --> 01:28:59.334
but you did pay for it and it is
yours.

1046
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:01.510
We're in the office.

1047
01:29:09.082 --> 01:29:10.693
Sir. we have a problem.

1048
01:29:11.084 --> 01:29:12.825
What's going on?
[hushes]

1049
01:29:12.869 --> 01:29:16.307
Sir. there's four suspicious
cars
coming from the south alley.

1050
01:29:19.136 --> 01:29:22.531
They're going through the main
entrance.
Waiting for instructions.

1051
01:29:25.403 --> 01:29:27.057
What's happening?
What's going on?

1052
01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:29.059
Sir. do you read me?

1053
01:29:30.147 --> 01:29:31.366
Fix it.

1054
01:29:31.409 --> 01:29:32.932
Carmen. can you hear me? Carmen.

1055
01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:35.370
Sir? Sir. do you read me?

1056
01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:39.243
Okay. everybody standing by

1057
01:29:41.332 --> 01:29:43.552
Snipers?
Yes. ma'am. Ready.

1058
01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:45.118
Team one.
Ready set.

1059
01:29:45.162 --> 01:29:46.381
Team two.
Ready. ma'am.

1060
01:29:46.424 --> 01:29:47.817
All right. Standby.

1061
01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.174
Can anybody see them?

1062
01:29:57.217 --> 01:30:03.049
[music]

1063
01:30:12.624 --> 01:30:14.496
I've got your passports right
here.

1064
01:30:16.715 --> 01:30:20.415
I'm sure you will be
very impressed with the work.

1065
01:30:22.112 --> 01:30:23.853
One. two. three.

1066
01:30:25.115 --> 01:30:26.595
All yours.

1067
01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:32.992
