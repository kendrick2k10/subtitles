00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:46.375
[breathing deeply]

179
00:11:52.708 --> 00:11:54.958
[Doris] I don't know
how you sleep like that.

180
00:11:56.791 --> 00:11:58.791
I'm not sleeping. Meditating.

181
00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:00.083
[inhaling sharply]

182
00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:01.083
Does it help?

183
00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.625
Hmm. Think so.

184
00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:11.541
You know when you wake up in the morning.
everything is good for a minute

185
00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:13.208
before the shittiness hits you?

186
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:14.750
[inhaling]

187
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:16.541
I get that minute when I meditate.

188
00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:21.125
I tried yoga when my hip started hurting.
but...

189
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:22.583
it didn't work for me.

190
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.708
Do you. uh...

191
00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.416
You have a little something
to help me sleep?

192
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.958
I don't do that anymore.

193
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:37.708
You know the judge said
that I wasn't allowed.

194
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:43.083
Well. I guess you really aren't using
if you're awake too.

195
00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:46.458
I'm gonna head to work.

196
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.541
I'll stop at the pharmacy
and get you something.

197
00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:54.916
[floorboards creaking]

198
00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:12.416
[woman 1] Why don't you get some sleep?

199
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.208
[Noah] I'm not tired.

200
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.125
Look at all the shooting stars.

201
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.708
Those are satellites. Noah.

202
00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:38.083
[people shouting indistinctly]

203
00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:41.875
[indistinct screaming]

204
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.000
[more indistinct screaming]

205
00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:56.125
[indistinct shouting]

206
00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.458
[people chattering
and laughing indistinctly]

207
00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:06.000
-Hey. hey. hey. I need more stuff.
-Relax. okay?

208
00:14:06.083 --> 00:14:10.666
Downers. benzos. phennies. tooies.
red jackets. people are crazy right now.

209
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.833
amped up. That shit'll be. like. gold.
I'll double the price.

210
00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:15.500
No. fuck. I didn't say that.

211
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:17.416
Yeah. Yeah. you did say that.

212
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.708
All right. I'll do it. Fucking Gregg's
a man of his word. all right?

213
00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:22.791
Cash in. cash out. Cycle of life.

214
00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:25.833
I'll double the price
on all types of zombie pills. Come on.

215
00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:28.375
-Okay.
-Okay.

216
00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:39.041
Angel?

217
00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:42.458
Where the fuck is everyone?

218
00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:06.583
[keys jangling]

219
00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:11.166
[brakes squealing]

220
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.083
[indistinct chattering]

221
00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:20.708
[woman 4] How'd you get
your cars to run. huh?

222
00:15:20.791 --> 00:15:23.416
How come our cars aren't working?
What the fuck is going on?

223
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.375
[banging on door]

224
00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:32.291
-Hey!
-Easy.

225
00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:35.416
Easy. I'm 68 Whiskey. Corporal Adams.
Out of Fort Huachuca.

226
00:15:35.916 --> 00:15:37.291
What are you doing up here?

227
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.791
Not active anymore. I mean. I might be.

228
00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:42.458
I don't know. They call in reserves yet?
I just don't know.

229
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:43.458
She's fine.

230
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.333
That's a lot of pills. Jill.

231
00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:49.500
I can explain.
It's not what it looks like. I promise.

232
00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:52.041
-[woman 5] Pack those up for me. please.
-[Jill] Yes. ma'am.

233
00:15:56.291 --> 00:16:00.041
I know you stuck your neck out for me
to get this job. and I am so appreciative.

234
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.250
-and-- and I know I screwed up--
-I don't care.

235
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.000
Was that an EMP yesterday? Are we at war?

236
00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:10.375
People are saying it's been happening
all over. Who would we even attack?

237
00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:13.291
[Jill] Major Murphy?

238
00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:16.500
Hard drives are useless.
Anything with a microchip is fried.

239
00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:18.500
Here's everything I have on hard copy.

240
00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:20.250
-Hey.
-Hey.

241
00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:22.250
[soldier] Any additional personnel?

242
00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:24.541
I'm starting a hub.

243
00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:26.041
We could use you.

244
00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:27.333
What's going on. Murphy?

245
00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:31.583
We were the "get answers" people
over there. They need those people again.

246
00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:32.583
[soldier] Major...

247
00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:34.458
we need to go now.

248
00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.208
I can't do that anymore.

249
00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:44.375
This is the location of the hub.

250
00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:46.750
I'd like you to get Lori and my children.
and...

251
00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:48.750
get down there as soon as you can.
all right?

252
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.125
Absolutely. No problem.

253
00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:56.000
[man 3]
You don't understand how serious this is.

254
00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:58.291
You should have gone with her.

255
00:16:58.375 --> 00:17:01.041
How is Murphy gonna bring the power back?
She's a psychiatrist.

256
00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:02.500
[man 3] It's not about the power.

257
00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:05.916
There are contingencies for that.
Replace enough wires and fuses...

258
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.250
It's about the people.

259
00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:10.666
Nobody can sleep.

260
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.166
[exhaling] After 48 hours of no sleep.
there's a loss of critical thinking.

261
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.875
Ninety-six hours.
hallucinations. motor failure.

262
00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:20.500
But what about after that?
Organs will fail but then what?

263
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.708
Days of lying in paralysis
until the heart shuts off?

264
00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.000
Yeah. yeah. I know what happens.

265
00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:29.041
Of course. you do.

266
00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:31.000
But this is different.

267
00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:32.916
Everything is accelerated.

268
00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:35.791
Symptoms are appearing
two to three times quicker.

269
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.208
It's gonna be total chaos.

270
00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:40.291
We're not all going to die.

271
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:46.916
-Well. this is not happening to everyone.
-Yes. it is.

272
00:17:48.166 --> 00:17:50.958
Well. there is this one woman
who can sleep.

273
00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:52.708
They're bringing her to this hub.

274
00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:56.166
Matilda was sleeping too.
My daughter was sleeping.

275
00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:58.875
Are you sure?

276
00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:03.750
Jill. they're setting up a whole station
based on this one sleeper.

277
00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.791
That's how big of a deal she is.

278
00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:10.416
Are you sure your daughter was sleeping?

279
00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.708
Oh. I-I... I got into a car accident.

280
00:18:14.166 --> 00:18:16.333
-but I'm fine.
-Was your daughter also hurt?

281
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.833
What are you saying?

282
00:18:18.583 --> 00:18:20.958
I'm just saying.
odds are she wasn't sleeping.

283
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:23.750
What. do you think she's unconscious?

284
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.791
There are no such thing
as unconscious people anymore.

285
00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:29.291
They're either...

286
00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:31.333
on. or they're...

287
00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:33.875
off.

288
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.083
[footsteps hurriedly departing]

289
00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:43.000
[door closing]

290
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.208
[dogs barking]

291
00:18:59.416 --> 00:19:00.333
Matilda?

292
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:01.625
Matilda!

293
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:03.875
Matilda!

294
00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.500
[panting]

295
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.083
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?

296
00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.833
Where is your sister?
Where is your sister?

297
00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:12.833
You're hurting me!

298
00:19:12.916 --> 00:19:14.416
-[shaky breathing]
-Psycho.

299
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.666
I'm sorry. I know.

300
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.416
Where-- Where is Matilda? Is she okay?

301
00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.625
Yeah. she's fine.

302
00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:21.875
Where is she? Please. Noah.

303
00:19:22.416 --> 00:19:24.541
Church. Grandma took her to church.

304
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:27.833
Maybe we are meant to be awake.

305
00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:34.208
'Cause you need to be woke
to see how the world really is.

306
00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:38.708
And the Lord says.
"Come to me. all who labor

307
00:19:39.416 --> 00:19:41.833
and are heavy laden.
and I will give you rest."

308
00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:43.458
She's not sleeping.

309
00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:48.375
[knocking on door]

310
00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:49.583
[door opening]

311
00:19:50.083 --> 00:19:52.000
[footsteps approaching]

312
00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:54.333
[door closing]

313
00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:56.291
Not sleeping. Birdie?

314
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.708
Only my dad called me that.

315
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:04.166
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'm just... tired.

316
00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.458
[pastor sighing]

317
00:20:14.416 --> 00:20:15.375
Not everyone...

318
00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:18.416
asked to be called to God. you know.

319
00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:21.541
Some people just are.

320
00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:27.958
I know that more than most
because before I was a pastor...

321
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:31.458
I was a drug addict.

322
00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:34.916
[chuckling]

323
00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:39.458
Covered up the evidence with a tattoo.

324
00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:44.666
I overdosed.

325
00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:48.250
I mean. I should've died within hours.
but I didn't.

326
00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:53.625
I had built up such an immunity
to narcotics over the years. I just...

327
00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:57.625
laid there for three days in rest...

328
00:20:58.916 --> 00:21:00.541
'til eventually I passed.

329
00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:06.541
But I was only gone for a minute
when they found me.

330
00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:11.500
So. like Jesus. I...
returned from the dead.

331
00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:12.416
[chuckling]

332
00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:17.291
Now. I'm not comparing myself to Jesus.
I just...

333
00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:18.416
[inhales deeply]

334
00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.291
I'm saying that...

335
00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:24.291
since that day.
I dedicated my life to serving him.

336
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.041
And to me...

337
00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.375
it was a miracle that I survived.
you know?

338
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.541
And I think people really need
a miracle right now.

339
00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:40.458
I'm not sure what...

340
00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:42.916
I mean...

341
00:21:46.708 --> 00:21:48.000
You think I need to die?

342
00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:49.916
No.

343
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:51.875
No. of course not.

344
00:21:53.541 --> 00:21:55.750
No. I'm sorry. No.

345
00:21:58.041 --> 00:21:59.041
I. um...

346
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:02.625
[inhaling deeply]

347
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:04.208
[pastor exhaling]

348
00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:09.833
It's just everyone is tired
and... desperate. you know?

349
00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:14.250
People just want to know if you can sleep.

350
00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:17.750
I can sleep.

351
00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:20.875
It's just hard when I'm not tired.

352
00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:25.000
Would it be okay if I prayed with you?

353
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.250
A lot of children say my prayers
are so boring. they nod right off.

354
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:34.166
[chuckling]

355
00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:43.041
Lord. we thank you for this day
and we thank you for Matilda.

356
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:47.000
What the...

357
00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:48.916
[panting]

358
00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:51.291
Oh. okay.

359
00:22:51.708 --> 00:22:55.375
717-127-0414.

360
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:56.833
[grunting]

361
00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:59.750
[mumbling numbers softly]

362
00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:03.416
[Noah] Pizza. really?

363
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.750
Uh. no. it's a test
for mental sharpness.

364
00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:09.000
-[Noah] How'd you do?
-I-I got two wrong. It's fine.

365
00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:12.625
Uh. we need to go and find a car.
and get your sister somewhere safe. okay?

366
00:23:12.708 --> 00:23:14.208
Everything with a circuit's fried.

367
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.916
-Cars don't work. Jill.
-[sighing] Some do. Noah. Okay?

368
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.916
So. can you just help me out. please?

369
00:23:19.208 --> 00:23:20.541
Grab your bag. Let's go.

370
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:23.416
We need to be careful.

371
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.916
Oh. shit!

372
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.208
-Your daughter. can she sleep?
-[Jill] What?

373
00:23:27.291 --> 00:23:29.583
-Is this your boyfriend?
-No. No!

374
00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:30.625
[Jill panting]

375
00:23:30.708 --> 00:23:32.500
She can't sleep? Is she okay?

376
00:23:32.583 --> 00:23:35.791
No. she's fine. she's fine. I was wrong.
She was just pretending.

377
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.000
Matilda was totally sleeping.

378
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.083
I woke her up.

379
00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.000
[Jill sighing]

380
00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:42.583
What? She was sleeping.

381
00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:46.750
Jesus. Jill. we need to get your daughter
to Murphy.

382
00:23:47.083 --> 00:23:48.833
-Look. she could be key.
-Noah. we gotta go.

383
00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:49.958
I know where the hub is.

384
00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:51.875
They're setting up a station
to help solve this.

385
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.375
Look. they already have this one sleeper.

386
00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:57.458
Brian. we're not going there.
Come on. Noah. let's go.

387
00:23:59.291 --> 00:24:01.375
[Jill yelling] Hey! Yo. that's my bike!

388
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:02.625
Hey!

389
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.541
[pastor] In our basement.
like an angel of peace.

390
00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.000
a young girl sleeps.

391
00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:09.958
So if she can sleep.

392
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:12.125
-that means we can too.
-[people murmuring]

393
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:14.250
So. as all mankind lays awake.

394
00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:15.583
we pray for answers.

395
00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:18.000
-[man 4] Pastor...
-Yeah.

396
00:24:18.083 --> 00:24:19.500
So what if she can sleep?

397
00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:22.833
Miracles spread. Jim.

398
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:25.458
Just like good grows.
if you believe in it.

399
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:26.875
if you give it a fighting chance.

400
00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:29.375
[man 5] There is no over-the-counter
sleeping pills left.

401
00:24:29.458 --> 00:24:31.166
[man 6] Give us the stuff
behind the counter!

402
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.500
[man 5] You'll have to talk
to your doctors. Get the notes.

403
00:24:33.583 --> 00:24:35.041
[man 6] You know no doctor's answering
his phone.

404
00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.416
Please. I can't help you!

405
00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.375
[indistinct screaming]

406
00:24:40.208 --> 00:24:41.041
Come on.

407
00:24:45.125 --> 00:24:46.666
Come on. Noah. Keep up.

408
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.416
[indistinct screaming continues]

409
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:52.625
Come on.

410
00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:55.375
Whoa.

411
00:24:57.416 --> 00:24:58.291
[Jill] Wait here.

412
00:25:16.708 --> 00:25:17.833
[Noah] Oh. God.

413
00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:22.166
It's only going to get worse.

414
00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:25.458
What's happening to everyone?

415
00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:26.458
[indistinct screaming]

416
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:27.791
[dog barking]

417
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.333
If we don't sleep...

418
00:25:30.583 --> 00:25:32.791
Your mind will bend and bend
until it breaks.

419
00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:34.500
-[Noah sighing]
-You snap.

420
00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:36.541
Life changes like that.

421
00:25:37.458 --> 00:25:40.416
But it's adversity
that prompts us to change

422
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.125
-when we otherwise wouldn't.
-[all] Amen.

423
00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:43.583
So then we embrace it.

424
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:45.000
[Jim] Pastor...

425
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.875
She's awake.

426
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:50.583
[people murmuring]

427
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.833
-Matilda...
-When are you gonna make us sleep?

428
00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:56.583
-Patience. please.
-[man 7] I don't have patience right now.

429
00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:59.666
Raymond isn't responding.
He's eating but not talking.

430
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.583
-He's tired. just like the rest of us.
-He's beyond tired.

431
00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:05.250
-He'll be fine.
-[woman 6] We should sacrifice her.

432
00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:06.375
[pastor] No.

433
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:09.791
God sacrificed Jesus.
his own son. to save us.

434
00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:12.000
God willingly sacrificed himself
for our sins.

435
00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:15.958
There is no sacrifice needed.
We... We only need prayer.

436
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.541
God help me.
I'm willing to be Pontius Pilate

437
00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:20.500
-and condemn the girl.
-Robert. sit down.

438
00:26:20.583 --> 00:26:21.416
[yelling] Sit down!

439
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.250
-[pastor] That's enough.
-[man 7] What good is prayer?

440
00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:24.416
We need sleep.

441
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.833
Oh. Matilda.

442
00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:27.625
-[Matilda] Mommy!
-Hey. hold on.

443
00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:31.166
Please. sit-- Sit down everyone.

444
00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:34.291
Jill. we just wanted to pray with Matilda.
that's it.

445
00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:37.958
She can sleep. Maybe she can help.
Lord knows we all need help right now.

446
00:26:38.666 --> 00:26:42.083
Come on. Matilda is my daughter.
and she's coming with me.

447
00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:44.541
-[woman 7] Not legally. she ain't.
-Please. sit-- sit down.

448
00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:47.750
Doris... Doris takes care
of those kids by law.

449
00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:50.791
You're right.

450
00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:54.875
But right now. with what's happening.

451
00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:57.500
I can help. and you know I can help.

452
00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:01.041
-[Jill] Okay. come on. Matilda. Let's go.
-[Jim] She has to stay here.

453
00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:02.041
[pastor] Hey. Jim.

454
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:03.125
She's special.

455
00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:04.208
-[woman 8] She is.
-Okay.

456
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:05.875
-Just calm down. everyone.
-[Matilda] Mom?

457
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:07.750
-[man] Pastor. you promised.
-Sit down. please.

458
00:27:07.833 --> 00:27:09.666
[Brian] We're on the same team here.

459
00:27:12.208 --> 00:27:13.833
You're all absolutely right.

460
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:17.458
-She is special.
-[woman 9] That's right.

461
00:27:18.041 --> 00:27:20.000
[Brian] But she can't help anyone here.

462
00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:22.583
Now. we're all gonna die

463
00:27:23.083 --> 00:27:24.458
if we don't solve this.

464
00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.750
Right now. your brains
are slowly swelling.

465
00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:31.875
Our cranial walls are impressing
on the brain.

466
00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:33.833
and it's affecting critical thinking.

467
00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:36.250
It's what happens when we don't sleep.

468
00:27:37.541 --> 00:27:40.291
Now. the more excited we get.

469
00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:42.958
the more blood flows to the brain.
the worse we are.

470
00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:46.208
So. the best thing we can do right now...

471
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:47.416
[inhaling deeply]

472
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.750
is take a deep breath...

473
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:49.708
[exhaling]

474
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:51.458
and calm down.

475
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.250
Now. we're gathering scientists
and doctors to help solve this.

476
00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:01.083
And they can.

477
00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:07.208
And all they need is the girl.

478
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:08.666
Mom?

479
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.583
[breathing heavily]

480
00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:12.791
No one dismisses the value of science.

481
00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:16.875
but neither is she a test subject
to run experiments on...

482
00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:19.125
-You're not taking her anywhere.
-[pastor] Jim. please.

483
00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:21.791
-[woman 10] That's right.
-Prayers are not gonna save--

484
00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:23.375
Fucking people.

485
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:25.833
if you don't hand her over.
I'll be back with the Army.

486
00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:27.250
and they're not gonna ask nicely.

487
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.125
-You calm down!
-[Brian] Is that what you want?

488
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.916
Because unless you people wake up.
that is exactly what is gonna happen.

489
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.375
And book throwing. that's gonna--

490
00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:35.291
[gunshot]

491
00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.291
[people screaming]

492
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:40.541
[pastor] Jim. what have you done?

493
00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:42.583
[woman 7] Doris took her down the back.

494
00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:45.708
Noah. Noah. look at me.
You're gonna be okay. All right?

495
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:48.541
I need you to meet me in the forest
out back. I'm gonna get your sister.

496
00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:50.500
[people screaming indistinctly]]

497
00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:04.666
-[woman 11] She in there?
-[man 9] Hey!

498
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.500
-[man 9] Bring her out!
-[man 10] Get her out here!

499
00:29:06.583 --> 00:29:09.333
[man 9] She's not in there.
Get the guys. Let's look out back.

500
00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:10.916
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

501
00:29:12.166 --> 00:29:13.541
[crowd gasping]

502
00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:15.458
-[Doris gasping]
-Where is she?

503
00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:17.958
[Doris] She's not in there? She was.

504
00:29:18.416 --> 00:29:19.625
It's a miracle.

505
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.000
This isn't Jesus
rising from the tomb. Doris.

506
00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:28.166
This is not who we are.

507
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:34.041
[pastor] Jim?

508
00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:34.958
Jim!

509
00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:39.541
[soft crying]

510
00:29:41.666 --> 00:29:42.500
Matilda.

511
00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:46.666
Oh. my God. my baby.

512
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.833
-Oh. baby. Oh. baby.
-[Matilda whimpering]

513
00:29:49.416 --> 00:29:52.291
-Grandma told me to run. but I couldn't.
-Oh. that's okay.

514
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:55.208
-Are you okay?
-Oh. No. I'm fine. baby. I'm fine.

515
00:29:56.208 --> 00:29:58.500
-Please.
-[Jim] God spoke to me. Pastor.

516
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:01.458
-Put it down.
-[Jim] We can't let her leave.

517
00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:05.291
Jim. put it-- put it down. please.
You're scaring everyone.

518
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:06.916
[pastor breathing heavily]

519
00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:09.750
[panting]

520
00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:20.541
[pastor] Jim!

521
00:30:22.208 --> 00:30:24.291

How are you feeling?

535
00:31:03.708 --> 00:31:04.666
No more running.

536
00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:07.625

Where are we going? [panting]

548
00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:35.916
They call it the hub.

549
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:37.791
We can't go there.

550
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.583

I touched a dead body to get this.
A dead body!

554

It's not safe there.

555

What's your plan here. Jill?

556
00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:55.041
We bring Matilda somewhere safe.

557
00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:57.875
we both die. and she lives alone?

558
00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:00.458
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

559
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:04.708
Here.

560
00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:07.541
Light this. Light it.

If we're all gone.
she'll be dead within days.

567
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:30.708
There's another woman there already.
They're gonna find a cure. They will.

568
00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:38.500

when whatever the fuck was happening...

603

00:41:01.708 --> 00:41:04.291
help set parameters for interrogation.

703
00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:09.416
Sleep deprivation. it was torture.

704
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:17.875
They killed people.

705
00:41:22.458 --> 00:41:26.958
The kind of things that we would do
to try to find answers. it's not human.

706
00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:31.833
Are we still going to the hub?

707
00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:34.250
[sighing]

708
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.208
Yeah.

709
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.333
[Jill] Oh. my God.

710
00:42:40.416 --> 00:42:41.916
[tires squealing]

711
00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:44.750
[tires squealing]

712
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:49.375
We're gonna need. like.
a book on mapping.

713
00:42:51.916 --> 00:42:52.833
[sighing]

714
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.416
Hey. sweetheart.

715
00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:06.500
[Matilda] Hey.

716
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:08.875
[Jill] You okay?

717
00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:10.291
[Matilda] Mm-hmm.

718
00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:12.166
[Jill] Come here.

719
00:43:12.708 --> 00:43:15.916
I-- I want to make sure
that you understand how this works. okay?

720
00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:19.791
Mom. I know how a library works.

721
00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:23.166
Yeah. The computers don't work anymore.
so...

722
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.625
This is gonna be your new school.

723
00:43:26.208 --> 00:43:28.916
So. when mommy's gone.
you'll need to find a library.

724
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.041
Okay? And... read. Don't stop reading.
and I...

725
00:43:32.125 --> 00:43:33.166
[breathes heavily]

726
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.625
...and I need you to learn
as much as you can. okay?

727
00:43:36.708 --> 00:43:38.291
'Cause you are my smart girl.

728
00:43:39.166 --> 00:43:40.083
All right.

729
00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:41.833
All right. Um...

730
00:43:42.583 --> 00:43:44.541
Um. come with me over here.

731
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:45.791
Here we go.

732
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:50.166
Okay. look at me. I'm gonna teach you
something very important. okay?

733
00:43:50.458 --> 00:43:52.833
I need you to learn
how to shoot this gun. okay?

734
00:43:52.916 --> 00:43:56.750
And. look at me. not just for people.
but for animals too. All right?

735
00:43:56.833 --> 00:43:58.291
And we're gonna find you a rifle.

736
00:43:58.375 --> 00:44:00.125
and you're gonna learn
how to shoot that too.

737
00:44:00.208 --> 00:44:02.625
because the world
is different now. baby. okay?

738
00:44:02.708 --> 00:44:04.666
And you gotta be prepared for anything.

739
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.416
All right? Here we go.

740
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.750
Put two hands on the gun for me.
There you go.

741
00:44:09.208 --> 00:44:10.041
Okay.

742
00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:13.708
Hold onto it strong
just like the handlebars of your bike.

743
00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:17.708
Put this foot forward. There we go.
Nice strong stance. okay?

744
00:44:18.208 --> 00:44:20.666
Keep both eyes open.
And you see that eye groove?

745
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.166
I want you to look right through that.
all right?

746
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.500
Now focus. breathe.

747
00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:25.583
[shaky breathing]

748
00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:26.666
You can do this.

749
00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:29.916
I don't like guns.

750
00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:32.583
-Matilda. please.
-[Matilda] I don't want to.

751
00:44:32.666 --> 00:44:33.833
-You have to.
-No!

752
00:44:33.916 --> 00:44:34.791
-You have to.
-No!

753
00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:36.833
-Yes. Matilda!
-We're gonna find a cure. okay?

754
00:44:36.916 --> 00:44:38.666
And you and Noah are gonna shoot the gun.

755
00:44:39.583 --> 00:44:40.541
[Matilda gasping]

756
00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:42.250
[gunshots]

757
00:44:42.333 --> 00:44:43.250
[crying]

758
00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:44.416
[Jill] Now you do it.

759
00:44:45.666 --> 00:44:47.083
-Oh.
-[crying] I'm going to the car.

760
00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:48.416
Wait. baby. Baby. come--

761
00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:49.916
[Noah] Hey!

762
00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:54.125
Did you shoot at me?

763
00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.375
No. Noah. I thought you were in the car.

764
00:44:57.916 --> 00:44:59.916
I was here. I said I was here.

765
00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:01.875
Who's in the car. Noah?

766
00:45:01.958 --> 00:45:02.958
No one.

767
00:45:03.041 --> 00:45:04.916
You said to find books on mapping.

768
00:45:07.458 --> 00:45:08.291
[sighing]

769
00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.250
Just don't shoot at me again. okay?

770
00:45:13.916 --> 00:45:17.583
[Noah] I think the coordinates lead here.

771
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:21.041
[Jill] Mmm.

772
00:45:22.166 --> 00:45:23.375
It looks like...

773
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.041
it... it's 1.500 miles away?

774
00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:33.166
I think it's 150 miles. I don't know.
We haven't slept in four days.

775
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.291
I-I wrote down the directions.

776
00:46:26.208 --> 00:46:27.041
I think.

777
00:46:27.125 --> 00:46:28.458
[thudding in the distance]

778
00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:30.791
[thudding continuing]

779
00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:35.416
[man 13] Hey!

780
00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:38.000
[Jill panting]

781
00:46:38.416 --> 00:46:40.416
Matilda. Come on.

782
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.583
[panting]

783
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.875
[tires squealing]

784
00:46:44.958 --> 00:46:46.666
No. No.

785
00:46:47.291 --> 00:46:49.083
[yelling] Stop! Stop!

786
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:52.208
[man 14] Hey.

787
00:46:53.083 --> 00:46:55.875
I'm not stopping. I'm gonna hit you.
I'm not stopping.

788
00:46:55.958 --> 00:46:57.000
[tires squealing]

789
00:46:57.083 --> 00:46:58.125
[yelling] Fuck you!

790
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.416
Hey. I ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:47:06.625 --> 00:47:07.500
I ain't.

792
00:47:08.583 --> 00:47:09.583
I promise.

793
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:13.000
Just. hey. let me have the boy.

794
00:47:14.083 --> 00:47:16.958
No. you can go. I'll let you go.
Hey. give me the boy.

795
00:47:17.958 --> 00:47:19.541
I'll let you-- I'll let you go.

796
00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:24.208
I'm just messing around.
I'm messing around.

797
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.708
We're all free men here. It's all good.

798
00:47:31.083 --> 00:47:32.791
Hey. can I-- Can I have that gun?

799
00:47:32.875 --> 00:47:34.208
Noah. I'm gonna shoot at one.

800
00:47:34.291 --> 00:47:37.125
They're gonna scatter. You're gonna
go inside and lock yourself in. okay?

801
00:47:37.666 --> 00:47:38.541
Noah!

802
00:47:39.416 --> 00:47:41.875
-Noah!
-Hey. give me-- Give me the gun.

803
00:47:42.916 --> 00:47:44.083
Are you gonna shoot me?

804
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:46.875
Go on.

805
00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:48.333
-Sweetheart--
-[gunshot]

806
00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:49.708
[men exclaiming]

807
00:47:56.333 --> 00:47:57.166
Noah. run.

808
00:47:57.416 --> 00:47:58.416
[yelling] Noah. run!

809
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.250
Yeah. run. Noah. you pretty little bitch.

810
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:05.291
[tires squealing]

811
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:07.166
Hey. Mommy. Get in.

812
00:48:07.958 --> 00:48:09.458
-Get in. Mom. please.
-Get in!

813
00:48:10.708 --> 00:48:11.708
Yeah. get in.

814
00:48:13.166 --> 00:48:15.291
-Who are you?
-[man 15] Why does it matter?

815
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.583
What is your name?

816
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.041
-I said. "What's your name?"
-Dodge! Dodge. call me Dodge.

817
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:24.208
How did you get out. Dodge?

818
00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:27.583
I was locked in the cells.
guards were gone. okay?

819
00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:30.500
We were starving. and I thought
that. you know. I was gonna die in there.

820
00:48:30.583 --> 00:48:32.541
And then the guards came back
and opened the cell.

821
00:48:32.625 --> 00:48:34.875
-[Jill] You just walked out?
-Yeah. I just walked out.

822
00:48:34.958 --> 00:48:37.291
-Where are you heading?
-I'm in a red fucking jumpsuit. Okay?

823
00:48:37.375 --> 00:48:38.958
I'm heading far away.

824
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:40.833
-Far from here. okay?
-Watch out!

825
00:48:40.916 --> 00:48:42.583
-[Jill. Dodge grunting]
-[tires squealing]

826
00:48:43.458 --> 00:48:44.375
[Dodge grunting]

827
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:46.833
[Dodge grunting]

828
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.208
Ha!

829
00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:49.583
[pants. chuckling]

830
00:48:49.666 --> 00:48:50.875
[Dodge laughing]

831
00:48:50.958 --> 00:48:52.625
-[Dodge continues laughing]
-[engine idling]

832
00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:54.333
There are no bullets in that.

833
00:48:54.416 --> 00:48:55.250
What?

834
00:48:56.041 --> 00:48:57.750
There are no bullets in that gun.

835
00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:00.833
[engine turns off]

836
00:49:00.916 --> 00:49:03.000
I keep the keys. And we need gas.

837
00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:04.500
[door opening]

838
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.583
No bullets. huh?

839
00:49:11.958 --> 00:49:12.791
Fuck!

840
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.500
Oh. my God.

841
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.125
[Matilda] Mom?

842
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.041
[Jill] Okay. that should be clean enough.

843
00:49:27.125 --> 00:49:29.708
So. you saw I put it in the gas tank.
right?

844
00:49:29.791 --> 00:49:33.125
And now I want you to just. um. suck on it
like a straw.

845
00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:34.375
but do it hard.

846
00:49:34.458 --> 00:49:37.416
and then when it comes out.
put the gas in the tank.

847
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.458
You're gonna put it in here. okay?

848
00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:45.958
So your sister can sleep. huh?

849
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:52.916
Where's your father at?

850
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.166
[Noah sighing]

851
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:56.083
He died...

852
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:57.708
in the war.

853
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:58.708
Oh. he served.

854
00:50:00.416 --> 00:50:01.291
Not bad.

855
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:03.708
Not good either.

856
00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:13.666
[Dodge] Change of clothes. baby!

857
00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:27.375
Go on.

858
00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.125
Come on. you can do it.

859
00:50:29.708 --> 00:50:32.208
Come on. you gotta learn. Matilda.
You got this.

860
00:50:33.083 --> 00:50:34.833
[sucking]

861
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:38.958
-[Jill] Oh! Oh.
-[coughing]

862
00:50:39.041 --> 00:50:41.458
-I drank it.
-Okay. baby. It's okay. It's all right.

863
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:42.833
-Spit it out.
-[coughing]

864
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.083
Hey. your mom's hardcore. man.

865
00:50:45.458 --> 00:50:48.833
[sighing] She's getting Matilda ready
in case we can't find a cure.

866
00:50:49.916 --> 00:50:52.416
-She thinks I don't know what she's doing.
-A cure?

867
00:50:54.458 --> 00:50:56.208
You guys are trying to find a cure?

868
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:08.041
You know. the funny thing is.
I usually sleep. like.

869
00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:09.791
two to three hours tops at night.

870
00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:11.625
but now. you know...

871
00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:14.958
So. you're taking our car?

872
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:20.541
Well. depends where you're heading.

873
00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:24.666
North. Lewisburg. right?

874
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:26.666
[Dodge] Hmm.

875
00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:30.125
That's where I'm heading. too.

876
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:31.791
North.

877
00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:36.833
You know. you should probably
hang onto it.

878
00:51:36.916 --> 00:51:39.291
You. uh. look pretty mean
pointing it at people.

879
00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:41.791
Just in case something happens.
[chuckling]

880
00:51:49.958 --> 00:51:53.291
[engine revving repeatedly]

881
00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:56.541
[Jill] That's good. baby.

882
00:51:56.625 --> 00:51:58.916
Remember. two hands on the steering wheel.

883
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.375
Yes. I have two hands.

884
00:52:01.416 --> 00:52:03.916
Okay. I was just telling you
so you don't forget.

885
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.250
You always say
I have a really good memory.

886
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.583
-Why do you think I'll forget?
-Eyes on the road. please.

887
00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:11.375
Thank you.
[sighing]

888
00:52:11.458 --> 00:52:15.291
Fixing this car is gonna be so hard.
Oh. man. Okay.

889
00:52:16.125 --> 00:52:18.375
But there are books on that. okay?
You hear?

890
00:52:18.458 --> 00:52:20.958
Burn the books. man. Burn 'em all.

891
00:52:21.041 --> 00:52:23.250
-Don't need those anymore.
-Ah. eyes!

892
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:26.791
Can you maybe just not--
Focus on the road. please.

893
00:52:26.875 --> 00:52:28.833
Not talk to her
so she can concentrate. please.

894
00:52:32.625 --> 00:52:35.375
[Dodge] Enough people said
that the Earth was flat.

895
00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:36.708
so the Earth was flat.

896
00:52:37.666 --> 00:52:39.958
Then. they said the Earth was round...

897
00:52:40.833 --> 00:52:43.125
so the Earth was round.

898
00:52:44.416 --> 00:52:45.833
The Earth is round.

899
00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:48.125
Prove it.

900
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.750
[Noah] Science proves it.

901
00:52:50.833 --> 00:52:54.125
[Dodge laughing] Science?
And who understands the science. huh?

902
00:52:54.208 --> 00:52:56.000
Eyes on the road. please. always.

903
00:52:56.083 --> 00:52:58.000
[Dodge] Enough people talk
about something. right?

904
00:52:58.083 --> 00:52:59.208
Then it becomes fact.

905
00:52:59.291 --> 00:53:03.750
Then they put it in the books.
and then the book becomes fact.

906
00:53:03.833 --> 00:53:04.916
Then it's settled.

907
00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:09.166
Then no one understands it anymore.
no one even talks about it anymore.

908
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.125
Fuck. this is why
we gotta burn the books. man.

909
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:13.666
He said the F-word.

910
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.666
I know. Please shut up.

911
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:16.875
[Dodge. softly] Sorry.

912
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.541
-She's a kid.
-Okay.

913
00:53:21.916 --> 00:53:24.583
You know. my grandmama.
you know what she used to tell me?

914
00:53:24.666 --> 00:53:26.458
-Huh?
-That all the world's problems

915
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:28.541
could all disappear in one generation

916
00:53:29.333 --> 00:53:32.541
if every kid grew up
forgetting all the shit they were taught.

917
00:53:32.625 --> 00:53:35.166
the shit that doesn't make sense.

918
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.708
but you're taught it enough times.
you believe it.

919
00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:39.708
Then we can actually live in a world

920
00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:41.666
where no one is starving...

921
00:53:43.666 --> 00:53:44.875
and everyone's equal.

922
00:53:44.958 --> 00:53:46.375
-Really?
-Whoa.

924
00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:51.416
I'm sorry. guys.

925
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.500
I used to think she was crazy. though.
Grandma.

926

[Dodge laughing]

927
00:54:01.708 --> 00:54:03.083
Man. but now...

928
00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.458
maybe she was on to something.

929
00:54:09.791 --> 00:54:12.166
-Watch out. You see that there?
-[Matilda] Yeah.

930
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.375
Go right around the car. just like that.

1057
01:02:07.583 --> 01:02:08.500
[man 18] Hey. hey.

1058
01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:09.625
-[Jill] Huh?
-You.

1059
01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:12.958
That's mine.

1060
01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:16.333
Huh? Oh. okay.

1061
01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.708
Okay. I'm sorry. I. uh...

1062
01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.333
Oh. wh--

1063
01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:23.333
Where's the woman. uh. that can sleep?

1064
01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:26.500
Yeah.

1065
01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:33.125
Oh. God. Oh. God.

1066
01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.291
You need blood samples?

1067
01:02:48.958 --> 01:02:50.458
They already did radio x-ray.

1068
01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.875
Yeah. I need blood--
I need to take blood samples.

1069
01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:56.791
Yeah. Okay.

1070
01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:00.041
Okay.

[woman 14 breathing heavily]

1072
01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.375
[woman 14 groaning] Oh.

1073
01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:41.083
How much blood can you take from me?

[breathing heavily]

1075
01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:44.375
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

1076
01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.791
I want out of here.

[groaning]

1078
01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:51.291
Good. I can help you with that.

1079
01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:01.875
You need to raise my daughter.

1080
01:04:02.916 --> 01:04:05.166
I have a little girl. She's ten years old.

1081
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:08.250
and she needs you to help her
in the new world.

1082

[clears throat]

1083
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:10.583
I...

1084
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.166
I can't--

1085
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:14.333
I...

1086
01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:15.458
-I can't--
-No.

1087
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:16.875
Is-- Why?

1088
01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:18.416
She can't make it on her own.

1089
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:20.750
She needs somebody to help her.

1090
01:04:20.833 --> 01:04:23.666
Okay? She needs someone to help her.
You're the only one who can do it.

1091
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:27.416
In the next few days.
the rest of us are gonna be dead. okay?

1092
01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.083
I'm gonna take you out of here.

1093
01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.458
I'm the one that needs help.

1094
01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:34.916
[inhales deeply] I was supposed to be dead
months ago.

1095
01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:37.875
You're crazier than the rest of them.

1096
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.833
Jill?

1097
01:04:41.958 --> 01:04:42.958
[Jill] Dr. Murphy.

1098
01:04:43.916 --> 01:04:44.958
I. uh...

1099
01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:46.958
-[Murphy] What are you doing here?
-[panting]

1100
01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:48.916
I came to help.

1101
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.375
After you left the campus.
Brian helped me with the coordinates.

1102
01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:54.291
Brian...

1103
01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:57.041
My family. are-- are they with you?

1104
01:04:57.416 --> 01:04:58.375
Oh...

1105
01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:01.458
No. uh...

1106
01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.166
Brian was. um...

1107
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:07.333
I'm-- I didn't see him again.
So I'm assuming he was here.

1108
01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:08.333
They're not here?

1109
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:10.875
I'm sorry.

1110
01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:16.000
Uh...

1111
01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:18.083
Is there a cure?

1112
01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.625
It's been six days. and we're no closer.

1113
01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:26.166
We have. um. a cocktail
that helps with mental acuity.

1114
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:27.916
but it's-- it's causing some...

1115
01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:29.958
neurological damage.

1116
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:31.000
But it is...

1117
01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:32.458
It's buying us some time.

1118
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.708
This morning. I...

1119
01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:37.541
[inhaling deeply] I thought...

1120
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.083
maybe the only answer...

1121
01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:41.416
[chuckling]

1122
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.916
we're gonna get is...

1123
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.041
that none of us are gonna survive.

1124
01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:49.291
But...

1125
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.625
you got here. right?
[chuckling]

1126
01:05:51.708 --> 01:05:53.375
I mean. that must mean something.

1127
01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:56.333
Get some meds...

1128
01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:59.583
get situated. and let's get to work.

1129
01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:02.208
I'm so glad you're here.

01:08:28.333 --> 01:08:29.958
I can help people sleep?

1176
01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:31.583
[Katz] Yes.

1177
01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:35.500
And we need to find out
what makes you so special.

1178
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:46.000
Is he still alive?

1179
01:08:46.083 --> 01:08:49.041
[Katz] Oh. yeah. she is still alive.

1180
01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:54.500
We. um...

1181
01:08:56.125 --> 01:08:58.583
had to ease the tension by...

1182
01:08:59.416 --> 01:09:01.833
draining the cerebral fluid. but...

1183
01:09:02.666 --> 01:09:04.125
that hasn't helped.

1184
01:09:04.208 --> 01:09:07.791
A catch-22. The only way
to ease the tension is to drain the fluid.

1185
01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:11.375
the only way to clean the brain
is the fluid.

1186
01:09:13.333 --> 01:09:14.541
Can I touch her?

1187
01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:16.000
[Katz] Sure.

1188
01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:18.541

[Katz] Ether.

1192
01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:43.833
Well. see?

1193
01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:46.208
Nothing.

1194
01:09:46.291 --> 01:09:48.208
-[chimp whimpering]
-No effect.

1195
01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:51.916
Most animals are able to sleep...

1196
01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:55.833
after the incident. but chimps. well...

1197
01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:58.916
they were always closest to humans.

1198
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:00.625
[Murphy] Hi.

1199
01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:04.708
I'm Dr. Murphy.
I'm-- I'm a friend of your mom's.

1200
01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.208
Can she?

1201
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.125
[Katz] Uh. we're gonna. um...

1202
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.875
try the ether on you now. Matilda.

1203
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:17.166
-To prove that you're special.
-[Matilda] Will it hurt?

1204
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:19.833
[Katz] No. we're not gonna hurt you.
I'm a doctor.

1205
01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:21.666
We don't hurt people.

1206
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:23.375
[Murphy] Kinda weird. huh?

1207
01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:24.333
Yeah.

1208
01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.666
[Murphy] Slow. easy breaths. babe.

1209
01:10:32.458 --> 01:10:33.583
There you go.

1210
01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:35.750
Nice and easy. It's okay.

1211
01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:41.291
Nice and easy.

1212
01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:54.083
She sleeps.

1213
01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:57.666
Poor thing.

1214
01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:04.208
Amazing.

1216
01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:19.875
Hey.

1217
01:11:22.416 --> 01:11:23.250
I...

1218
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.416
I want to be disappointed...

1219
01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:29.375
that you didn't tell me about Matilda

1220
01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:31.583
after all I've done for you.

1221
01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:34.250
But. as a mother. I understand.

1223
01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:40.250
How long have I been here?

1224
01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:41.708
Uh...

1225
01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.333
Eighteen hours.

1226
01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:49.250
Why can she sleep?

1227
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:51.125
Who?

1228
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:52.958
[Murphy] Who? Matilda.

1229
01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:00.000
Has she had any. um... any surgeries?

1230
01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:03.458
How long have I been here?

1231
01:12:10.833 --> 01:12:11.791
It was. um...

1232

a solar flare. we think.

1234
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:19.375
It... changed our electromagnetic wiring.

1235
01:12:19.458 --> 01:12:21.708
It affected our glymphatic system.

1236
01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:24.166
Messed with our...

It reduces the beta-amyloid.

It'll help.

1255
01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:18.666
Um. it's most effective
when injected near the brain.

You're hurting her.

1272
01:14:07.166 --> 01:14:09.458
[Katz] We're trying to restart her heart.
Do it again.

1273

That's why they're all melting.

1280
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.958
We have to get rid of the spiders.

1281
01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:39.375
-It's all the spiders in here.
-[Murphy] Well...

1282
01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:42.208
Let's get her brother up here...
so we can compare them.

1283
01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:43.958

[Noah] You wanted to find a stranger
to leave Matilda with.

1289
01:14:58.041 --> 01:14:59.416
I guess that's what you do.

1290
01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:02.166
