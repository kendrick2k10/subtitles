00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:42.090
he seemed to have been
faltering in school.

341
00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.425
<i>and every now and then.</i>

342
00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:45.183
<i>he would get into
some kind of trouble.</i>

343
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.984
<i>Not large matters but...</i>

344
00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:50.154
<i>My father lamented all the time.</i>

345
00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:56.994
<i>When I was in the army.</i>

346
00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:59.641
I was stationed in Texas.

347
00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.266
Fort Bliss. El Paso. Texas.

348
00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:06.137
and my father drove there.

349
00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:08.372
He had. as I say. one arm.

350
00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.443
<i>When we sat down and talked.</i>

351
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.713
<i>he was expressing
his concern about my brother.</i>

352
00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:22.386
<i>But it was beyond
his ability to control.</i>

353
00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.362
[Jean]
<i>We were all sitting around</i>

354
00:20:31.429 --> 00:20:33.030
<i>in the small kitchen
that we had.</i>

355
00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:36.011
My mother and father
are getting our dinner.

356
00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:37.946
and they're serving us.

357
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.104
And my brother Jim is there.

358
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:44.242
All of us were there. sitting
around. and he's kind of laughing.

359
00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:46.021
<i>He had done something wrong</i>

360
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:48.957
<i>and we were all eating
and very serious.</i>

361
00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.182
<i>And I can remember him saying.</i>

362
00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:53.117
"I know
what you're all thinking.

363
00:20:53.184 --> 00:20:55.653
You think Mom got the wrong
baby at the hospital.

364
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.854
don't you?"

365
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:59.190
And then he said.

366
00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:00.836
"But you can't even say that

367
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.194
because I look just like his."

368
00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.834
<i>Always my brother Jim
was a worry</i>

369
00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:16.741
<i>and my brother Bill was a
source of pride all the time.</i>

370
00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.256
<i>Bill got into politics.</i>

371
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.526
Actually. honestly. it was the
force of his own personality.

372
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.728
He had always been well liked.

373
00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:28.152
He was very outgoing.

374
00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:30.599
He had a good sense of humor.
even as a kid.

375
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:35.871
<i>and he delivered groceries.
so all the ladies loved him.</i>

376
00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:38.496
[William]<i> I read the biography</i>
<i>of James Michael Curley</i>

377
00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:41.543
<i>and it's all about
his life here.</i>

378
00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:43.745
<i>and also
the neighborhoods of the city.</i>

379
00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:45.681
<i>I became familiar with that.</i>

380
00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:47.905
<i>I was fascinated by all of it</i>

381
00:21:47.972 --> 00:21:50.352
because I had the interest
in politics to begin with.

382
00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:52.910
<i>And Curley had
a beautiful way of speaking.</i>

383
00:21:52.977 --> 00:21:54.578
<i>He has a great aura to him.</i>

384
00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.514
[on recording]
<i>I James Michael Curley...</i>

385
00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:59.583
[William]<i> And I used</i>
<i>to do a take off of him.</i>

386
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.563
[man on speakers]
<i>If Curley is elected governor.</i>

387
00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:03.454
<i>then he will take
the useless gold dome</i>

388
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:05.723
from the top of the State House.

389
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.636
turn it upside down.

390
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.105
place it in the middle
of Flood Square.

391
00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:13.264
fill it with water and let the
little children of South Boston

392
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:14.832
use it as a swimming pool.

393
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:19.981
[William]<i> It was in 1960</i>

394
00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:22.117

395

for the House
of Representatives.

396
00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:25.276
There was a vacant seat

397
00:22:25.343 --> 00:22:27.945
and I ran all over the place

398
00:22:28.012 --> 00:22:30.058
and knocked on doors

399
00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:32.394

that was necessary.</i>

400
00:22:32.418 --> 00:22:33.795
<i>One of my opponents</i>

401
00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.287
<i>used to call me
"Same Suit" Bulger.</i>

402
00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:38.556
<i>because I always
wore the same suit.</i>

403
00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.091
Because it was the only suit.

404
00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.138
<i>And the night that I won.</i>

405
00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:45.941
<i>I was happy that when he came

406

we stood on the stage together.

407
00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:51.469
I introduced myself
as "Same Suit."

408
00:22:53.838 --> 00:22:56.707
<i>At age 26.
I was elected to the House.</i>

409

<i>It was a happy life for me.</i>

411

just about had it. You know.

416
00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.337
I think at the time.

417
00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:30.118
I may have even told
my sweet wife "just one term"

418

That's how insufferable

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.019
Oh. I'll tell you
what happened then.

422
00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:44.666
I just think he was so happy
doing what he was doing

423
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.335
<i>and he was doing
such good things.</i>

424
00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.293

<i>I mean. certainly my mother
did the lion's share of it.</i>

[Jimmy]<i> He used to read to us</i>
<i>at night when we were kids.</i>

he'd sit on the floor.

Kids beside him. kids behind him

434
00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:10.915
and everybody would be
following the same story.

A couple
on the couch up above him

436
00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.984
and he'd have his back
to the sofa

437
00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:15.764

Stevenson's<i> Treasure Island</i>

a couple of chapters a night.</i>

by the court.

452
00:25:09.707 --> 00:25:12.087
to bus kids from
one neighborhood to another

453
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:14.422

but I'd be at the bar drinking.</i>

511
00:28:13.826 --> 00:28:17.472

I was introduced to him.</i>

512
00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:20.297
<i>I had heard he was a
bank robber and all this stuff.</i>

513
00:28:20.364 --> 00:28:23.667
You know. it didn't make any
impression one way or another.

514
00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.638
<i>So I'm sitting there at the bar.</i>

515
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:30.618
<i>We're just engage in
meaningless conversation.</i>

516
00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:34.355
And one of our guys had
stopped at the Killeen's bar room

517
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.513
in Southie that night
and got his nose bit off

518
00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:39.494
and shot three times in the arm.

519
00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:41.719
And before he went
to the hospital.

520
00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:44.966
he came into the club
to tell us what happened.

521
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.968
Two guys took him
to the hospital

522
00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:48.703
<i>and we all piled into one car.</i>

523
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.728
<i>We ran out of room
and Whitey said.</i>

524
00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:52.730
"I'm going that way."

525
00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:54.709
Hmm. okay.

526
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:58.802
I know he was with the Killeens
and that's who had shot Mickey.

527
00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.604
<i>I said. "I don't think
we'll be talking again."</i>

528
00:29:00.671 --> 00:29:03.051
<i>He says. "No. See you later."</i>

529
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.676
Who knew
we were on opposite sides?

530
00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:07.578
And then the shooting started.

531
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.548
<i>We'd hunt each other.</i>

532
00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:15.018
<i>He almost got me
one summer evening.</i>

533
00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:19.223
<i>Tried to come in the window
with a grease gun. I think.</i>

534
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.258
<i>I grabbed the rifle out of
the closet.</i>

535
00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:24.762
<i>A .30-06 with a scope.
and I jumped out the window</i>

536
00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:26.563
<i>because I see him.
which way he was running.</i>

537
00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.143
and I kept dropping on one knee

538
00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:30.278
trying to get him
in my scope but I couldn't.

539
00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:31.869
I couldn't get
a clear shot of him.

540
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.711
His mother lived here

541
00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:42.513
and he was pretty close
with his mother.

542
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.449
So I see this is a real good
place to try and get him.

543
00:29:45.516 --> 00:29:47.618
He won't expect me
to be in the weeds here.

544
00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:52.634
I staked this place out
periodically.

545
00:29:52.658 --> 00:29:56.237
For about 18. 20 months
I showed up here.

546
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.773
I thought I had a real good
shot to get him here.

547
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.297
but I never did.
He never showed up.

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:17.014
It was time to end it anyhow.

had been done on both sides.

I started beating people up.

Besides my regular job.

573
00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:19.343
I beat a couple of people up
for Jim Bulger.

And then basically.
one day he came and he says

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:55.796
<i>I had indicted Whitey Bulger
in a narcotics case</i>

676
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.289
under seal to prevent him
from fleeing back in the '80s

677
00:35:59.356 --> 00:36:00.868
when I was US Attorney.

678
00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:01.936
So I knew a bit about him.

679
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.204
The word on the street was

680
00:36:03.228 --> 00:36:05.829
Whitey kept the drugs
out of South Boston?

681
00:36:05.896 --> 00:36:07.008
Complete lie.

682
00:36:07.032 --> 00:36:10.233
Quite the contrary was true.

683
00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:11.501
So I knew all about

684
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:13.503
the nefarious deeds
of Bill's brother.

685
00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.305
but I just never made
any connection there.

686
00:36:15.372 --> 00:36:17.107
And if I wasn't going
to make that connection.

687
00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:19.176
believe me. nobody else was.

688
00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:21.355
I wouldn't have known Whitey
Bulger if I'd fallen over him.

689
00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:22.957
I had no idea who he was.

690
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:26.449
He had nothing to do with
government as far as I could see.

691
00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.451
No impact on public policy.

692
00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.587
I had no idea what he was doing.

693
00:36:30.654 --> 00:36:33.590
I mean.
the dominant Bulger brother

694
00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:36.293
was the Senate President.
not this other guy.

695
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.709
<i>The state government
that he and I entered</i>

696
00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:45.335
<i>in 1960 and 1962
as young state legislators.</i>

697
00:36:45.402 --> 00:36:48.916
<i>it was one of the three or
four more corrupted in America.</i>

698
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.141
Bill Bulger was the guy
that brought integrity

699
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.943
to the Massachusetts
State Senate.

700
00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:56.591
Nobody understands this.

701
00:36:56.615 --> 00:36:59.616
<i>Sadly.
not really well recognized.</i>

702
00:36:59.683 --> 00:37:02.396
<i>what he did to set
those kinds of high standards</i>

703
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.887
<i>and maintain them.</i>

704
00:37:03.954 --> 00:37:06.089
<i>And we're benefiting
from that now.</i>

705
00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:10.671
And I think he has a right
to take a pretty good chunk

706
00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:12.762
of the credit
for helping to make that.

707
00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:20.036
[Bowns] <i>He seemed to be
someone who believed in power</i>

708
00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:22.906
and wielding power
to get things done.

709
00:37:22.973 --> 00:37:25.486
[applause]

710
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.555
[Bowns] <i>I'd say he's
someone who's very principled.</i>

711
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:29.890
<i>very religious.</i>

712
00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:32.649
<i>I think
he's a compassionate man.</i>

713
00:37:32.716 --> 00:37:37.031
soft spot in his heart for
the most vulnerable people.

714
00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:38.455
poor people. children.

715
00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:41.591
<i>and very stubborn.</i>

716
00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.261
Won't compromise
on his convictions.

717
00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:46.774
A recession is not
a moral justification

718
00:37:46.798 --> 00:37:50.900
for casually punishing
the helpless. the homeless.

719
00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:54.070
the sick. the disadvantaged.

720
00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:58.808
We cannot
and we must not squander

721
00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:01.945
a half century
of social progress

722
00:38:02.012 --> 00:38:05.726
to pay the bills
of a difficult year.

723
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.797
We cannot turn our backs
on the education of the young

724
00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:11.621
or the care of the elderly.

725
00:38:13.223 --> 00:38:17.093
We cannot. and I am confident
that we shall not.

726
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:20.630
be found wanting
in performing the work

727
00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:24.567
that we have been
so clearly sent here to do.

728
00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.802
Thank you very much.

729
00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.937

732
00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:56.377

733
00:38:56.401 --> 00:38:59.246
<i>"There's nothing
to be concerned about."</i>

734
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:03.506
But all of the indicia
were there.

735
00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:05.842
And...

736
00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:11.381
You knew you had
something to worry about.

737
00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:24.260
[Nee clears throat]

738
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.734
This is the Mullen Club.

739
00:39:32.102 --> 00:39:34.104
This is where we socialized.

740
00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.672
All the fighting was over.

741
00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:38.975
so you wouldn't have to duck
and weave anymore and hide.

742
00:39:39.042 --> 00:39:41.845
We would socialize here.
We would drink here.

743
00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:43.313
We ran dice games here.

744
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.892
We ran card games here.

745
00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:46.560
We did cookouts in back.

746
00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:49.163
Everyone would come here
if they wanted to see us.

747
00:39:49.187 --> 00:39:51.154
including the police
and the FBI.

748
00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.571
<i>He would come by night</i>

749
00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.974
<i>and come in and all
the beer would go flat.</i>

750
00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:01.308
<i>But he didn't drink.</i>

751
00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:02.999
<i>He'd hang around a little bit.</i>

752
00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:04.411
<i>He didn't like to shake hands.</i>

753
00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.802
<i>He didn't like to touch people.</i>

754
00:40:05.869 --> 00:40:07.715
He would immediately
go in the bathroom.

755
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:08.983
Most people didn't catch on.

756
00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:12.119
but he'd go in and wash his
hands and he'd come back out.

757
00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:13.576
He didn't like contact.

758
00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:18.526
<i>He loved that people
would be fearful of him.</i>

759
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.283
<i>He really got off on it.</i>

760
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:23.553
<i>You know. little by little. we're
starting to pick up on this stuff.</i>

761
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.534
<i>This is not going
to be a good relationship.</i>

762
00:40:26.558 --> 00:40:29.292
But we didn't know how bad
it was going to turn out to be.

763
00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:31.161
He was not a good guy
to be around.

764
00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:39.369
[Weeks] <i>Unless we were doing
something it was really boring.</i>

765
00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.682
<i>Once a week. you'd go by.
you'd pick up the envelopes.</i>

766
00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:43.684
<i>People would drop off money.
you pick it up.</i>

767
00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:46.776
<i>You really didn't have
too much to do.</i>

768
00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:49.712
<i>Then when you had a problem.
everything stopped</i>

769
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.848
and you'd be out 24 hours a day.

770
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.366
<i>The people we'd grab. most
of them were involved in drugs.</i>

771
00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.191
<i>They were big drug dealers.</i>

772
00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.792
<i>And they were the people
that brought in</i>

773
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.928
<i>by the boat loads
or different things.</i>

774
00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:07.775
<i>We'd grab them and tell them
that they were going to pay us.</i>

775
00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:11.534
Oh. I remember one time
we got this fellow.

776
00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.336
talked to him for 20 minutes.

777
00:41:13.403 --> 00:41:17.518
And next day he showed up
with a hockey bag

778
00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:19.142
with $500.000 in it.

779
00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:26.393
<i>One fellow we shook down.
we got $1.6 million off him.</i>

780
00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.929
<i>So there's a lot of money
coming in.</i>

781
00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:31.020
[interviewer] Were you
bribing those guys? Just--

782
00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:34.023
[laughing] Bribing them? No.

783
00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.959
[interviewer] What were they
giving you this money for?

784
00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:37.060
For their life.

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:41.064
[ominous music playing]

786
00:41:46.169 --> 00:41:51.685
For Jim Bulger. Whitey.
violence was his last option.

787
00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:55.111
He would use anything
in his arsenal up until that.

788
00:41:55.178 --> 00:41:57.580
<i>whether it was scaring people
or intimidating people.</i>

789
00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:00.717
<i>beating people.
whatever... to get his way.</i>

790
00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:05.121
<i>But when he decided
to use violence.</i>

791
00:42:05.188 --> 00:42:07.501
especially against someone
that was capable...

792
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:10.037
He decided on killing them.
he was going to kill them.

793
00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:11.861
And there was
no changing his mind.

794
00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:17.177
<i>It was just business with him.</i>

795
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.668
He'd put everything into it.

796
00:42:18.735 --> 00:42:22.182
After he killed someone.
he'd be nice and relaxed.

797
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:24.985
It's kind of like taking
a Valium or something.

798
00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.587
He just...

799
00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:28.478
It was over and that was it.
It was done.

800
00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.446
And then he'd be
on to something else.

801
00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.615

804
00:42:40.158 --> 00:42:41.535
<i>He would bring you in.</i>

805
00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:44.338
And then he'd make you
do something

806
00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:47.163
so that you couldn't get out
because he had that on you.

807
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.765
Like Kevin buried the bodies.

808
00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:49.944
Kevin couldn't get out.

809
00:42:49.968 --> 00:42:51.345
I mean. if Whitey'd get caught.

810
00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:53.303
he's gonna say. "Kevin
buried those bodies there."

811
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.440
So it was just this whole game
that they were playing.

812
00:42:57.507 --> 00:42:59.486
It wasn't a game. though.
They were killing people.

813
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.078

all these charges on them.

1012
00:53:56.499 --> 00:53:59.813
there was. we never
had any idea. he. uh.

1013

that these things
he was accused of.

You know. being a bookmaker

You know?

1019
00:54:12.448 --> 00:54:13.827
There was a booking in every bar

1020
00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:15.317
and someone had to be the bank.

1021
00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:18.254

as all the other charges.

that he was not in informant

1050
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:04.626

<i>It was that thing they want
to be true so much.</i>

1056
00:56:22.111 --> 00:56:25.914
<i>So why would the government
want this so badly to be true?</i>

1057

<i>I don't know quite the answer
to that question.</i>

The pressure is really
on the FBI to find him.

1078
00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:27.509
[Kevin]<i> Part of it was because
it was such an embarrassment</i>

00:57:28.644 --> 00:57:32.692

1118
00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:24.159

in reverse and got out.

next hour changing the tire.

about eight policemen came up

and they just stopped
in front of us.

1135
01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:19.926
And my first thing is. uh-oh. and
he's just calm and looking at them

1136
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.594

and he said.

1137

In retrospect. giving
your power and prestige.

1175
01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:11.904
did you ever discourage
law enforcement

1176
01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.195
from doing everything

1177
01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.907
it could go after your brother?

1178
01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:15.831
Never.

1179
01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.378
With the Chairman's indulgence.

1180
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:22.849
I would like to offer
a few words about my brother.

1181
01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:25.518
Many words
have been written about him.

1182
01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.342
A few have been spoken by me.

1183
01:02:29.211 --> 01:02:31.813
So please allow me
to speak plainly.

1184
01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:35.862
I do not know
where my brother is.

1185
01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:41.667
I do not know where he has
been over the past eight years.

1186
01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:46.005
I have not aided James Bulger
in any way.

1187
01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.330
While he has been a fugitive.

1188
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:51.811
Do I possess information
that could lead

1189
01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.169
to my brother's arrest?

1190
01:02:54.236 --> 01:02:56.505
The honest answer is no.

1191
01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.710
I know my brother stands
accused of many things.

1192
01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:04.579
Serious crimes. brutal crimes.

1193
01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.093
I do still live in the hope

1194
01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.251
that the worst of the charges
against him

1195
01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.052
will prove groundless.

1196
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.220
It is my hope.

1197
01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:14.956
But I am ever mindful

1198
01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:18.260
of the Good Shepherd story

1199
01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:22.597
and its lesson that
no one is to be abandoned.

1200
01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:25.711
I care deeply for my brother.

1201
01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:28.603
But no one should construe
my expression of concern

1202

in any way
condoning any illegal acts.

1203
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.277

that I ever take lightly

1204
01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.278

There's nothing
I wouldn't have done for him.

1342
01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.331
And now I find out
you're an informant.

1343
01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:09.448
[Jimmy]<i> When you swear in
court to give your testimony.</i>

1344
01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:12.006

1345
01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.809
<i>If you've arrested
half a dozen guys</i>

1346
01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.411
<i>and threaten them
with life in prison.</i>

1347
01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.813
but if they talk
about this other guy

1348
01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:21.149
they can only do six years.

1349
01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:22.951
Well. they're talking
about that other guy

1350
01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.953
because it's worth more
than gold or currency.

1351
01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.665
It's freedom.

1352

I know you're mourning.

1356

much bigger here. We have--

1357
01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:46.151
What's the "bigger here"?
What's here?

1358
01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:48.843

1359
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:52.113
[woman]<i> So you take the crimes</i>

1362
01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:00.899
How do their combined crimes

1363
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:04.192
which include
at least 100 murders

of James Bulger?

1365
01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:10.509
The scales of justice
were altered.

1366
01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:12.667

that I was on the jury

1431
01:14:40.408 --> 01:14:41.876

<i>But then he would start
talking about his family.</i>

1435
