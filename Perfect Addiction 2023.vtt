3
00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.250
Some people are lovers.

4
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.833
Others. fighters.

5
00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:45.375
And sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference.

6
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.416
I was born a fighter.
but a girl's got bills to pay.

7
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.208
and I didn't have a safety net.

8
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.000
When I wasn't at school. I got a job

9
00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.208
training clients for Julian James.

10
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:58.416
the best fighter on this side
of the Mississippi

11
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.166
and the only father figure I'd ever had.

12
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.125
Looks like she's doing all the work.

13
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.083
-Keep it up. Sienna.
-Nice. One more. Nice.

14
00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:13.000
Now. my sister Beth.

15
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:16.000
she's a lover. and my other half.

16
00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:18.500
I mean. don't get me wrong.
She drives me nuts.

17
00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.500
but our friend Brent balances us out.

18
00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:23.416
That was the extent of my social circle.

19
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.875
and to be honest. I liked it that way.

20
00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958
-You need to focus.
-I tried. That's all you.

21
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.083
I mean. I have more interests.
I don't have to go to college.

22
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.458
Oh. yeah. You know. why?
Why would you get a big girl job

23
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:36.916
when you could just be
mooching off me forever?

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.416
-Great idea. I like where your head's at.
-Ha ha.

25
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.750
-So…
-I'm gonna be right back.

26
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.000
-Just give me one sec.
-I don't think it's gonna work.

27
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.875
-Hey. I'm Jax.
-Hi.

28
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.916
Oh. I knew exactly who he was.

29
00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:57.083
Sienna. right?
I heard you're a great trainer.

30
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.083
Maybe we can get in the ring sometime.

31
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:03.375
Yeah. he was cute.
but he had a reputation.

32
00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:05.375
and I wasn't just gonna let my guard down.

33
00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.041
He was a fighter…

34
00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.833
…and a lover.

35
00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.666
an intoxicating combination.

36
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.416
One. One. two.

37
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.416
Two. One. two. Two.

38
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.916
Jax was the best I'd ever trained

39
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.916
and the best fighter UFG had ever had.

40
00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:37.416
Nice. It's not just about power. okay?

41
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.208
-It's about precision.
-Is that right?

42
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.833
Making her MXM debut.

43
00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:43.416
we have standing in the center ring

44
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.166
a mixed martial artist from Springfield.

45
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.666
-12 wins by knock-out.
-Whoo!

46
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.625
Sienna "The Princess of Rage" Lane!

47
00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:58.208
-Whoo!
-And the crowd goes wild!

48
00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.916
Whoo!

49
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.500
-But…
-Ugh. "but…"

50
00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:08.541
I'm not a princess.

51
00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.208
No? You're my princess.

52
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.333
I tried to keep things professional. but…

53
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.708
Whoo!

54
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.208
…I was hooked.

55
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.041
One hit was never enough.

56
00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.250
Psst. Sienna.

57
00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:36.416
Sienna.

58
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.416
You're zoning out.

59
00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:44.541
I love you.

60
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.000
Normally. I'd have been more outspoken

61
00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:48.625
about his habit of tempting fate.

62
00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.625
but he thought he was invincible.

63
00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:52.708
and I bought in to the myth.

64
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.833
-Until he had an accident…
-Are you doing okay?

65
00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:01.166
…that brought us both back to reality.

66
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.500
-Si. what if I never--
-Hey.

67
00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:11.458
What if I can't fight anymore?

68
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:13.291
We're gonna get through this.

69
00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.541
You don't have to be here.

70
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.000
-Are you crazy?
-Maybe.

71
00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:25.000
-We're a team.
-Yeah.

72
00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:26.916
Rebel champions.

73
00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:33.000
Seeing him like that. so human.

74
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:35.375
hurting. made it all feel real.

75
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.083
Try to get it parallel to your hip. okay?

76
00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.166
Yep.

77
00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:47.833
I'm done.

78
00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:50.208
-Where are you going?
-What's the point?

79
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.833
If I can't kick. I can't fight.

80
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:56.208
Yes. you can. Jax.
if we strengthen your other skills.

81
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.291
What other skills?

82
00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:07.500
Come here.

83
00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:14.083
We're gonna find you a new edge. Okay?

84
00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.000
Yeah.

85
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.708
He needed me…

86
00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:22.500
…and that's when I really fell.

87
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.416
We were so much more connected.

88
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.666
and eventually he came back

89
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.833
better than before

90
00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:52.250
in every way.

91
00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:55.916
Hey. looking good.

92
00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:01.833
This is Jax. Leave a message.

93
00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:04.625
Hey. uh. so my last client canceled.

94
00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:07.833
Um. I'm just going to run
to the nutrition shop for you

95
00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.708
and I will be right home.

96
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.166
-Thank you.
-Okay.

97
00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.125
-Thanks.
-Okay.

98
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:23.541
Things were really good.

99
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.625
And that feeling?

100
00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:29.291
Man. I was riding the high…

101
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.875
…but I should've known
there would be a comedown.

102
00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.833
Jax. Beth…

103
00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:46.916
-Sienna.
-I'm so sorry.

104
00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.708
Oh. shit.

105
00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:46.833
No matter how far I'd fallen.

106
00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:50.208
I couldn't get him off my mind.

107
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:51.375
And the worst part?

108
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.083
He probably wasn't even
giving me a second thought.

109
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.166
-Hey. champ. You okay?
-I'm good.

110
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.708
-Great job this week.
-Thank you.

111
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.875
See you tomorrow. boss.

112
00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:17.083
Next stop.
Springfield Community College.

113
00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.833
Welcome to rock bottom.

114
00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:30.208
I needed a new project.
somewhere to focus my energy.

115
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.000
But I'd settle for a distraction.

116
00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:35.083
so school would have to do.

117
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.708
Econ 101 was not my fave.

118
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.583
but at least I had Brent.

119
00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:45.000
Brent's a good guy.

120
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:46.833
He's smart. levelheaded.

121
00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.541
and not fucking my sister.

122
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.625
In fact. he's all loved up

123
00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:52.541
and getting married in eight weeks.

124
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.833
Wow. that's what I get
for saving you the best seat in the house?

125
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.083
I see how it is.

126
00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.833
You okay?

127
00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:07.833
I caught my sister
and my boyfriend of a year

128
00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:09.875
having sex in our apartment.

129
00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.583
and I spent the night in the gym.

130
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.666
Beth and Jax? Shit.

131
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.708
Do you have a place to stay?

132
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.083
I can't afford much.
There's a wait list for campus housing.

133
00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:33.083
I may know a guy renting a room for.
like. 250 a month.

134
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.916
-Yeah?
-Just. um. be careful.

135
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.416
-He's--
-What? An ax murderer?

136
00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:41.791
Complicated.

137
00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:53.500
You spent the night with Daniel?

138
00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:55.541
Jesus. Alex. I was worried sick.

139
00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:08.250
He lives in a basement?

140
00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:11.916
Now I'm really getting murder-y vibes.

141
00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.208
-Fuck me.
-Excuse me?

142
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:35.208
Oh. shit.
That was supposed to be my inside voice.

143
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:38.458
Um. hi.

144
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.208
Kayden. right?

145
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.625
Brent told me that you might be
looking for a roommate.

146
00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.083
-No.
-What? No?

147
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:52.541
Look. I'm in a really tight spot.

148
00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:54.791
-No offense--
-Oh. wow.

149
00:10:55.708 --> 00:10:57.625
-What?
-No. it's just people say that.

150
00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:00.208
"No offense." like it'll
absolve them of the guilt

151
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:03.041
of whatever asshole thing
they were about to say.

152
00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:04.708
So what was it you were gonna say?

153
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:06.625
I don't think it's gonna be a good fit.

154
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:10.333
Look. I've been through a lot.
I have nowhere else to stay.

155
00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:11.708
Not my problem.

156
00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:15.166
Okay. Fair point.

157
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.666
It wasn't his problem.

158
00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:21.000
But did he have to be such a jerk?

159
00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:23.416
Well. at least he's up-front about it.

160
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.291
Jax kept that shit under wraps
till I was far too gone.

161
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:30.000
Back to the drawing board.

162
00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:32.500
As much as I hated asking for help.

163
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:35.291
maybe Julian could give me
a little direction.

164
00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:39.958
Julian. got anyone
on the books for me today?

165
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:41.625
'Fraid not.

166
00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:43.625
Everybody's jumping ship.

167
00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:49.000
Basement brawls
are starting back up at Powder Keg.

168
00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.958
More money. less rules.

169
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:56.166
and Jax is the poster boy.

170
00:11:58.458 --> 00:11:59.500
You didn't know?

171
00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:02.791
Loyalty isn't really his thing.

172
00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:04.208
Yeah. well. ever since he stormed out.

173
00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.166
we've been dying a slow death.

174
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.083
and now we've lost our best fighter.

175
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.416
-How are we supposed to compete with that?
-Well. we don't.

176
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.000
I would rather lose this gym honestly
than stoop to the underground.

177
00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:18.958
I mean. it's a sport. It's not worth
getting somebody killed for.

178
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:23.000
Kayden "The Killer" Williams. huh?

179
00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:25.083
Small world.

180
00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:28.416
Powder Keg was UFG's biggest rival.

181
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.291
and the underground operated
out of their basement.

182
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:36.208
Nothing feels legal here--
because it isn't.

183
00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.916
You're a trainer? UFG. huh?

184
00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:56.416
There is only one rule!

185
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.625
There are no rules!

186
00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:02.000
Oh. man. he's out!

187
00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:07.541
Hey there. princess.
Come to watch me fight?

188
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.625
-No. I've seen enough.
-Hey. hey.

189
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:12.083
-All right. stop.
-It just--

190
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:15.125
It just happened. okay?
You're the only one who understands me.

191
00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:18.208
I don't understand you at all.

192
00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:20.750
Please. can you help me do that?

193
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.875
I don't know. you just-- you got so busy.

194
00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.625
-Busy? Taking care of you!
-No. I didn't mean it like that. okay?

195
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.458
-You know I'm not good at this stuff.
-For the last year.

196
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.958
it's been all about you.

197
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:32.583
Figuring out how to rehab your stupid leg.

198
00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:35.416
meal prepping for you. loving you.

199
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.666
making sure that you're good
to fight again.

200
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.333
I made a mistake. Babe--

201
00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:43.041
A mistake is forgetting to pick up dinner.

202
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:47.916
Fucking my little sister is an act of war.

203
00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:50.666
Si--

204
00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:54.000
5 to 1 odds.

205
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:57.000
Deadbeat's favored. You want in?

206
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:01.916
100 on Kayden Williams.

207
00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:06.250
Right.

208
00:14:27.708 --> 00:14:31.125
Yeah! Let's go!

209
00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:32.333
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

210
00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:37.500
Brent? What are you doing here?

211
00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:39.500
I could ask you the same thing.

212
00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.625
I. uh-- I'm here with my fiancé.

213
00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:44.500
Evans. You must be Sienna.

214
00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.833
-Heard you had a rough week. huh?
-Yeah.

215
00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:48.791
But it's good to finally meet you.

216
00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:50.625
Unlike my love life.

217
00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:53.208
which had been very much on display.

218
00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:55.000
Brent kept things low-key.

219
00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:58.166
Like. he'd never introduced me
to his fiancé low-key.

220
00:15:03.666 --> 00:15:07.416
Kayden "The Killer" Williams!

221
00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:32.416
Ready? Ready?

222
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.916
Go. Fight.

223
00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:45.125
How do you know each other again?

224
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.875
He's my brother.

225
00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.791
I didn't know you had a brother.

226
00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:49.875
Adopted.

227
00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:06.291
Come here.

228
00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:15.166
He's good. but he's not unbeatable.

229
00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:18.291
He was till tonight.

230
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:34.708
Fuck.

231
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.541
How do you know him?

232
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:56.291
That's my ex.

233
00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:57.666
I'd give anything for Jax

234
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.000
to get a taste of his own medicine.

235
00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:02.375
It didn't look like
that was gonna happen tonight.

236
00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:06.166
but Kayden had promise.

237
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:22.916
Police. police. police!

238
00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:27.750
-Shit. Shit. shit. shit.
-Hey. it's a raid.

239
00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.791
Deadbeat. break it up! We need to get out!

240
00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:34.208
-Everybody's going!
-See you later. Sienna.

241
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.666
-We're not done yet.
-Let's go. let's go.

242
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.916
-Everybody out of here.
-I want my rematch. Killer!

243
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.208
Keep walking.

244
00:17:50.291 --> 00:17:53.333
-Come on. everybody out.
-All right. let's go.

245
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:10.083
Okay. I guess this is rock bottom.

246
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.000
Hopefully.

247
00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:14.541
I was out my last hundred bucks.

248
00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:16.791
and I couldn't keep sneaking into the gym.

249
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.458
I haven't tied one on
like that in so long.

250
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.708
Hey. good for you. Good for you.

251
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.625
I had to stop feeling sorry for myself.

252
00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:38.083
No more sad girl shit.

253
00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:40.666
I was on to that mad girl shit.

254
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.875
And I was not about to let
Jax get away with this.

255
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.000
Powder Keg was the seventh circle of hell.

256
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.208
right after CrossFit.

257
00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:50.916
but you can't slay a demon
if you're afraid of fire.

258
00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:58.375
I thought I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

259
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:01.041
Technically. you told me
I wasn't your problem.

260
00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:04.708
And you were right. I am your solution.

261
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:08.250
-I'm good.
-You're good. but you're not great.

262
00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.916
Your reflexes are quick.
but you've got poor intention.

263
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.583
Your defense is spotty.
you telegraph your punches.

264
00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:15.416
and you're not using
the right hip movement on the mat

265
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.791
to offset someone stronger. which he is.

266
00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:23.208
-And that's why you need me.
-Oh. I need you?

267
00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:27.000
Yeah. I am the only person
who can help you beat Jax Deneris.

268
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.791
Who said I'm taking a rematch?

269
00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.500
I mean…

270
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.041
Look. I've been in the ring
with Jax for three years.

271
00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:41.208
I stand before you a copy of your enemy.

272
00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:45.708
I know how he thinks.
how he trains. how he kills.

273
00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:49.416
I saw you lose. and I am the only one

274
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.583
who can make sure
that doesn't happen again.

275
00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.166
Okay. what are you offering specifically?

276
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.416
I train you six days a week
from now through the rematch.

277
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.666
I train every day. 3-6-5.

278
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.541
Yeah. that's the first thing
I'll be changing.

279
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:07.875
You want me to train less?

280
00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.916
No. I want you to train smarter.

281
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.958
and rest days are a part of that.

282
00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:19.833
And in turn. you…

283
00:20:19.916 --> 00:20:21.250
let me stay in your apartment.

284
00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:22.833
I mean. come on.

285
00:20:22.916 --> 00:20:24.416
I bet all my money on you last night.

286
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.708
so. I mean. you kind of owe me.

287
00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:38.250
All right. lucky. let's see what you got.

288
00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:42.958
Well. I mean. for starters.

289
00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:44.333
just keep your eyes a little bit forward

290
00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:46.791
and take that curve out of your neck.

291
00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:50.291
Just kind of tuck in your lumbar sacrum.

292
00:20:57.291 --> 00:20:58.958
Your room's over there.

293
00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:04.500
Yikes.

294
00:21:16.083 --> 00:21:17.875
Hey. you go to SCC too.

295
00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:22.333
I didn't get to introduce
myself the other day. Cara.

296
00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:25.208
Sienna.

297
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:27.958
-Want a ride?
-Uh. no. I'm good.

298
00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:30.416
Are you sure? 'Cause the bus sucks.

299
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.250
and we're going to the same place.
Let's go.

300
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:42.000
-She's temperamental.
-Mm.

301
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:45.708
I'm guessing
I can't link my Spotify in this?

302
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:47.875
No.

303
00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:58.000
So. you lived in Springfield
your whole life

304
00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:00.208
and you don't have
any family here or friends?

305
00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:02.083
-Not anymore.
-Why's that?

306
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.833
Because that's my sister

307
00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:11.041
and that's my ex-boyfriend.

308
00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:13.708
Oh.

309
00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:17.416
Si. look. I tried to tell you.

310
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.625
but you're not the easiest
person to talk to.

311
00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:22.416
I've been working my ass off
trying to take care of you.

312
00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:26.166
Beth. I haven't been able
to get you to come to school for months.

313
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.041
and then you're gonna come together?

314
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:32.541
Si. I'm sorry--

315
00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:34.875
You don't know what
you're dealing with. okay?

316
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.291
He is toxic and manipulative.

317
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:38.958
You can't fix him.

318
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:40.916
I already tried.

319
00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:58.208
Kayden. Come on. cupcake. Rise and shine.

320
00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:15.625
Motherfucker.

321
00:23:15.708 --> 00:23:18.458
Hey. asshole. we had a deal.

322
00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:23.291
Hey. you're done.

323
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:28.416
Listen. I gave you
your money back. We're even.

324
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.000
I don't want your handouts. okay?
I want to win.

325
00:23:31.083 --> 00:23:32.916
We had a deal. Hit me.

326
00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:35.666
-No.
-Come on.

327
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.333
Hit me. Let's go!

328
00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:40.000
Look. I don't want to hurt you.

329
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.541
Find another project.
This is not personal.

330
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.166
Come on.

331
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.708
Hit me. Let's go.

332
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.708
All right. Let's go.

333
00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:06.875
Come on.

334
00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:19.625
It is personal to me.

335
00:24:21.916 --> 00:24:24.625
You wanna beat him? You just lost.

336
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:27.208
You're mine. Sienna.

337
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.500
I want you. All of you.

338
00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:38.708
Sienna. I'm tapping.

339
00:24:38.791 --> 00:24:39.791
Sienna.

340
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.166
Seriously?

341
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.916
Why does my mind keep going back to Jax?

342
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.750
You hungry?

343
00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:55.083
Yeah.

344
00:24:57.208 --> 00:25:00.958
Hi. neighbors. The usual?

345
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:03.833
-Mm-hmm.
-You got it.

346
00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:05.625
Can I get you anything?

347
00:25:06.666 --> 00:25:08.833
Five egg whites. scrambled.
with a side of salsa.

348
00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:11.750
half an avocado.
and a chicken breast. no oil.

349
00:25:11.833 --> 00:25:14.125
Coming right up.

350
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:21.416
So. uh. what are you studying?

351
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.708
Social economics in business.

352
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.791
Impressive.

353
00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:31.875
Look. this is gonna be really hard.

354
00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:34.583
Hard?

355
00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:37.000
The hardest you'll train in your life.

356
00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:38.125
Don't flatter yourself.

357
00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:40.125
I am never dating another fighter.

358
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:43.708
You shouldn't. Especially me.

359
00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:53.625
-Excuse me.
-That's what you're eating?

360
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:56.500
Nope. that's what you're eating.

361
00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:03.333
Mmm.

362
00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:06.416
You know there's no weight class
in the underground. right?

363
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.625
Jax is bigger than me.

364
00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:10.916
You don't need to cut.
but you should be tracking your macros.

365
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.750
Pack proteins with isolates.
and you'd better not be juicing.

366
00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:16.708
What else?

367
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:18.791
Julian doesn't want
any of his team in the underground.

368
00:26:18.875 --> 00:26:21.666
so I come to you at Powder Keg.

369
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.833
You do exactly what I say.

370
00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:26.750
No drinking. no smoking. no partying.

371
00:26:26.833 --> 00:26:27.875
No problem.

372
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.916
That's a really good burger.

373
00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:44.500
I know. It's my usual.

374
00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:47.375
Good choice.

375
00:28:06.083 --> 00:28:07.291
Come on. Quick feet!

376
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.291
Keep your abs tight.

377
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.125
Good to see you. stranger.

378
00:28:24.625 --> 00:28:26.708
Nice to see you too. boss.

379
00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:30.000
I got a few interesting calls this week.

380
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:32.000
One from a promoter

381
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:34.416
seeing if you wanted
to fight at the nationals.

382
00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:36.208
-Me?
-Yeah.

383
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:38.500
-Fight?
-Yeah.

384
00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:41.000
I'm just really busy. Um…

385
00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:43.833
Yeah. right. with all your clients.

386
00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:47.416
No. I just am taking
20 credits this semester.

387
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.208
-Your sister called.
-Here?

388
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:52.625
Yeah. she says you're not
answering your phone.

389
00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:54.666
Yeah. my bad?

390
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.625
She sounded like
she was seriously concerned.

391
00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:59.125
Wow. That's ironic.

392
00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:03.833
You know what?
Holding onto anger is like drinking poison

393
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:05.958
and expecting the other person to die.

394
00:29:09.083 --> 00:29:11.041
It's keeping you from being your best.

395
00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:16.291
Or maybe it's just giving me my edge.

396
00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:18.125
Get real with yourself. Sienna.

397
00:29:19.708 --> 00:29:22.833
I just think whatever it is.
this story that you're telling yourself.

398
00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:24.458
it's not necessarily reality.

399
00:29:34.833 --> 00:29:36.750
Okay. what are you looking at?

400
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:45.666
Don't just defend. Be first.

401
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.833
For every one. you give three.

402
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:53.250
No.

403
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.125
You're letting your guard down.

404
00:29:57.083 --> 00:29:59.041
-That's it.
-No. that's not it.

405
00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:02.500
Defense is not an action.
It's a given. okay?

406
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:04.500
Your resting state should be impenetrable.

407
00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:07.083
No one gets in. no one can hurt you.

408
00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:08.791
Come on. one. two.

409
00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:15.125
Every time someone attacks.
they leave an opening.

410
00:30:15.208 --> 00:30:17.791
Find the opening. close for the kill.

411
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:20.166
Right hook.

412
00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:24.375
Find the opening…

413
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.708
…close for the kill.

414
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:32.083
Okay.

415
00:30:41.833 --> 00:30:45.416
Sienna. can I talk to you. please?

416
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.791
Since when do you even work out?

417
00:30:46.875 --> 00:30:48.750
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

418
00:30:48.833 --> 00:30:50.375
Talk to me. please.

419
00:30:50.458 --> 00:30:52.833
-Get out of my way. Beth.
-No!

420
00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:55.666
-Jax told me to stand up for myself.
-Oh. he did?

421
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.750
Did he also tell you
to do your hair like this?

422
00:30:57.833 --> 00:31:00.416
'Cause it looks like
you fucked the Easter Bunny.

423
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.458
Move.

424
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.666
I was trying to move on.
but talk about triggering.

425
00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:17.583
Jax had told me
to stand up for myself. too.

426
00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:20.416
unless it got in the way
of what he wanted.

427
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.625
-That's all you got?
-Come on.

428
00:31:21.708 --> 00:31:23.416
-That's it?
-Hit me back.

429
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.333
I'm not gonna hit you back. okay?
I need you in one piece.

430
00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:29.291
If I'm ever gonna fight.
I need to take a hit.

431
00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:31.333
Who said you're gonna fight?

432
00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:37.041
The things you overlook
when you're under their influence.

433
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:39.791
Ooh!

434
00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:44.916
Come on. I could be really good.

435
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.666
You are good. but you're a better trainer.

436
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.208
Was that your sister?

437
00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:13.583
How could you tell?

438
00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:16.500
The tension.

439
00:32:16.583 --> 00:32:18.166
Mm.

440
00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:23.625
-What?
-Nothing.

441
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.000
Nothing? Doesn't sound like nothing.

442
00:32:25.083 --> 00:32:27.500
-What does it sound like?
-Judgment.

443
00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:30.416
-I don't know the situation here…
-No. you don't.

444
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.416
-…but family is important.
-Yeah?

445
00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:36.500
Is that why you're holed up
in a basement alone?

446
00:32:38.083 --> 00:32:39.291
Stay in your lane.

447
00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:54.000
Of course I was angry.

448
00:32:54.083 --> 00:32:56.000
It was helping me get over Jax.

449
00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:58.916
And I was getting over him.

450
00:33:02.208 --> 00:33:03.708
Kinda.

451
00:33:49.458 --> 00:33:51.000
Sienna.

452
00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:53.583
Sienna.

453
00:33:53.666 --> 00:33:55.333
Sienna!

454
00:33:55.416 --> 00:33:57.041
Good dream?

455
00:33:57.125 --> 00:33:59.416
Shit.

456
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.625
My alarm didn't go off.

457
00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:04.750
Let's go. It is officially confirmed.

458
00:34:04.833 --> 00:34:07.041
10:00. March 31st.

459
00:34:08.416 --> 00:34:10.291
-The rematch?
-Mm-hmm.

460
00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:14.125
Okay. you're gonna do what I say. right?

461
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:17.291
No moody disappearing act or quid pro quo?

462
00:34:18.416 --> 00:34:20.375
"If you do this. I'll do that."

463
00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.000
I know what quid pro quo means.

464
00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:25.541
-So?
-Yes. sensei.

465
00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:26.958
Good.

466
00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:29.416
By the way. you talk in your sleep.

467
00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:37.916
We'd made progress.
but if he was gonna have

468
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.916
any chance of beating Jax

469
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.958
I'd need to pull out all the stops.

470
00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:46.541
-Come on.
-What is this?

471
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.916
Mixing your MA. Do you trust me?

472
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.208
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you sure?

473
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:53.625
Well. when you say it like that…

474
00:35:05.291 --> 00:35:07.416
Okay.

475
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.916
This is sensitivity training.

476
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.208
The basic theory is
if your breath is grounded in your body

477
00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:14.833
and you're in sync with your opponent.

478
00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:17.625
you can overtake them
no matter their size.

479
00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:20.916
Okay? So just feel me.

480
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.291
Uh-huh. Nice and easy.

481
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:27.416
Breathe.

482
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.083
Feel my next move.

483
00:35:31.166 --> 00:35:34.416
So. stay grounded in your body

484
00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:37.708
so no matter what tries to control you…

485
00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:40.916
-Whoa!
-Oh!

486
00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:46.291
-Don't fall off.
-I'm not gonna let you fall.

487
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.083
You're good.

488
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:54.208
Feel my next movement. Yep. yep.

489
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:58.000
That's it. That's it.

490
00:35:58.083 --> 00:36:00.333
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

491
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:06.916
Nice.

492
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.500
-Again.
-Again.

493
00:36:15.083 --> 00:36:18.083
You are a unique trainer. Sensei Lane.

494
00:36:20.083 --> 00:36:22.083
I borrowed that exercise from Julian.

495
00:36:24.333 --> 00:36:26.833
-He is a legend.
-Yeah.

496
00:36:26.916 --> 00:36:30.291
It's big shoes to fill.

497
00:36:35.291 --> 00:36:37.833
We talked about me maybe--

498
00:36:37.916 --> 00:36:39.791
maybe running the gym with him someday.

499
00:36:39.875 --> 00:36:41.208
Really?

500
00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:42.833
It's kind of why I'm studying business

501
00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:45.416
so I can help
with the books and everything.

502
00:36:46.416 --> 00:36:48.666
So you really never considered fighting?

503
00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:55.250
Of course I did. I do.

504
00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:01.208
But Jax always said I wasn't tough enough.

505
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:03.583
-strong enough. good enough.
-Mm.

506
00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:08.125
Looking back. I think he didn't want me
to take what was his.

507
00:37:08.916 --> 00:37:10.916
The irony.

508
00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:14.625
And there's a whole stigma with women

509
00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:18.625
like we shouldn't get punched in the face
because beauty's our only asset.

510
00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:21.416
whereas men can afford to get busted up

511
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.500
because you guys have
other valued qualities.

512
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:31.833
Well. not that my opinion
matters for shit.

513
00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:36.916
but I support you fighting whatever war
you see as important.

514
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.083
Inside and outside the cage.

515
00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:46.041
I saw Jax and Beth at the gym.

516
00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:51.541
I've done a lot of things
in my life that I regret…

517
00:37:53.708 --> 00:37:55.291
…but he should know better.

518
00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.166
He's going to.

519
00:38:09.958 --> 00:38:12.166
Come on. you're letting your guard down.

520
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.000
Come on. Kayden. stay ahead of him.

521
00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.000
-Nice. Kayden.
-He's getting better.

522
00:38:16.083 --> 00:38:19.041
Yeah. his timing is improving.

523
00:38:19.125 --> 00:38:20.208
Come on.

524
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:23.041
That's it. Find the openings!

525
00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:26.458
Hit the holes! Nice.

526
00:38:26.541 --> 00:38:29.625
-Come on.
-Hey. princess.

527
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.958
You see me fight the other night?

528
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:33.375
KO in 34 seconds.

529
00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:35.291
Jax. stop. I'm working.

530
00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:37.708
-This is your new guy?
-Come on. Kayden.

531
00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:41.000
Yikes. That's a step down.

532
00:38:41.083 --> 00:38:43.208
He's just sparring.

533
00:38:43.291 --> 00:38:45.541
Come on. let me talk to you for a second.

534
00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:46.625
Hey.

535
00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:48.250
You're too good for this
underground bullshit.

536
00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:49.458
You don't belong here.

537
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.375
Since when do you care
about my well-being?

538
00:38:51.458 --> 00:38:53.666
What? You can't say that
I don't care about you.

539
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.000
When I wanted to fight on my own.

540
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:57.916
you didn't believe in me.
you shut it down.

541
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.416
And then when I tried to
get close to you. you cheated.

542
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.458
I got scared. okay? It's fight or flight.

543
00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.875
But I miss you. Si. Remember?

544
00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:08.958
It's you and I against the world.

545
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:10.750
Come here. Stop.

546
00:39:10.833 --> 00:39:12.458
Kayden. protect yourself!

547
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:14.666
Keep moving.

548
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.833
-You're still seeing her.
-I can stop.

549
00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:20.458
She's just easier.

550
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.291
-Easier?
-I didn't mean it like that.

551
00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:25.833
Kayden Williams is the next champion.

552
00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:28.125
and I'm training him to break you.

553
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:35.625
-Here. hold still.
-Mm.

554
00:39:35.708 --> 00:39:37.708
-Is that okay?
-Mm-hmm.

555
00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:40.833
-What'd Jax say?
-It doesn't matter.

556
00:39:40.916 --> 00:39:42.500
All that matters is that we win.

557
00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:46.125
-What if we don't win?
-We will.

558
00:39:46.208 --> 00:39:47.416
He knows you're a threat.

559
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.416
especially now that you have me.

560
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.416
Jax preys on weakness. okay?

561
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.625
So if you any.
we need to know what they are

562
00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:55.625
-and get ahead of them.
-Uh-huh.

563
00:39:55.708 --> 00:39:58.000
-Look what we got.
-Look what we have here.

564
00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:01.416
My girlfriend said you were begging
for sloppy seconds.

565
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.416
-Thought she was joking.
-You know. you have a really interesting

566
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.291
definition of girlfriend.
if it's someone you use.

567
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:09.458
gaslight. and cheat on
with her own sister.

568
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.208
Honestly.
not that surprising coming from someone

569
00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:14.833
that dropped out of the big leagues
to fight below their weight class.

570
00:40:14.916 --> 00:40:17.291
-You don't know shit about me.
-Yeah?

571
00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:20.000
-Yeah. there you go.
-Oh!

572
00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:22.541
-Back off. deadbeat!
-Oh. princess!

573
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.541
-Don't fucking call me that.
-Oh.

574
00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:30.416
Forgot how sexy you are when you're angry.

575
00:40:32.916 --> 00:40:35.208
Almost as sexy as your sister.

576
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:37.000
Yikes.

577
00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:39.041
Too much?

578
00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:43.041
Shit! Sienna!

579
00:40:44.166 --> 00:40:46.875
What the fuck? Hey!

580
00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:50.541
What the fuck? Get over here!

581
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.083
I'll fucking kill you!

582
00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:56.833
Go to hell!

583
00:41:04.666 --> 00:41:06.791
Jax brought out the worst in me.

584
00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:09.291
but it felt good standing up to him.

585
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.500
Maybe I need to do more for myself.

586
00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:30.458
What are you doing? I told you. I--

587
00:41:30.541 --> 00:41:33.291
You convinced yourself
you don't deserve a home. I know.

588
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:36.000
So. what do you think?

589
00:41:36.083 --> 00:41:39.375
Belladonna Lily or Labrador Blue?

590
00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:47.291
What? Was Benjamin Moore out of
Doom and Gloom Gray?

591
00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:50.291
Yeah. as well as Brooding Beige.

592
00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:55.958
Hmm. What about Annoying Orange
or Relentless Red?

593
00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:58.250
No. they weren't.

594
00:41:58.333 --> 00:42:00.666
Apparently. they still have those ones.

595
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.583
-Unfortunate.
-Mm-hmm.

596
00:42:07.666 --> 00:42:10.541
Come here!

597
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.791
-Oh. no. You wouldn't.
-I wouldn't?

598
00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:24.208
-No.
-You don't think I will?

599
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.625
-No. I don't.
-I will if you dare me.

600
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.958
-Not even that one. No. no.
-You owe me.

601
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:36.125
You brought this upon yourself.

602
00:42:36.208 --> 00:42:37.625
Come on. Just a little bit. Just a little.

603
00:42:37.708 --> 00:42:39.625
-Okay. Okay. a little.
-You owe it to me.

604
00:42:39.708 --> 00:42:41.916
-Just a little. Just a little.
-Yeah. okay.

605
00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:04.583
What?

606
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:07.500
I can't.

607
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.875
I can't have any distractions right now.

608
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.208
I gotta get my head in the game.

609
00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:17.875
I was almost pinned last night.

610
00:43:17.958 --> 00:43:20.625
You're right.

611
00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:22.500
Okay. we just need to focus.

612
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.916
Maybe we should try something different.

613
00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:30.916
No. absolutely not.

614
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.416
You don't understand
how dangerous it is. okay?

615
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.333
It's not a sport. it's senseless violence.

616
00:43:36.416 --> 00:43:38.750
and UFG is above that.

617
00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:40.916
If I get caught. I lose my license.

618
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.250
I lose everything.

619
00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:44.208
You're losing now anyway.

620
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:45.833
We've been underwater for months.

621
00:43:45.916 --> 00:43:47.916
Kayden is the real deal.

622
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.125
So why does he fight in the underground?

623
00:43:50.208 --> 00:43:52.916
Why don't you ask him?

624
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:02.750
Julian. this is Kayden.

625
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:05.500
It's an honor.
I used to watch all your interviews.

626
00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:07.458
Without you. I--

627
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:09.416
What. you wouldn't be
beating up men in basements?

628
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.166
Yeah. but you-- you opened my eyes.
You opened my mind.

629
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.250
-Oh. I did?
-Yeah.

630
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:17.041
You taught me that fighting
is about so much more

631
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:18.750
than just getting the biggest hit in.

632
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:22.666
Take a seat.

633
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:31.208
You know. martial arts is about joining
your mind. body. and spirit.

634
00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:33.583
It's an extension of your education.

635
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.125
Well. I always wanted to go to school.

636
00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:39.000
but to be honest.
that just wasn't in the cards for me.

637
00:44:39.083 --> 00:44:41.208
But I'd be hiding in the back of a gym.

638
00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:44.125
I'd be on a bus reading anyone
that you mentioned.

639
00:44:44.208 --> 00:44:45.916
So why stay underground?

640
00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:50.708
-It's all I know.
-Then why do you need me?

641
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.333
Because I need to beat Jax.
and that's where he lives.

642
00:44:58.416 --> 00:44:59.666
That's what this is about.

643
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.833
He betrayed me. And he betrayed you!

644
00:45:01.916 --> 00:45:04.208
-You have every right to want--
-Sienna. I--

645
00:45:04.291 --> 00:45:08.416
Come on. Julian.
this could really put us back on the map.

646
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.500
When Kayden wins.
he's gonna go legit here.

647
00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:13.708
and the fighters
are gonna flock from everywhere

648
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:15.500
hoping for the same thing.

649
00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:19.000
You're gonna have your champ
and a following.

650
00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:21.708
My champ and a following?
It's not about ego.

651
00:45:22.708 --> 00:45:25.000
Come on.

652
00:45:25.083 --> 00:45:26.083
Please.

653
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.500
We really need your help.

654
00:45:29.583 --> 00:45:33.375
I really need your help.

655
00:45:33.458 --> 00:45:34.916
Let me be clear.

656
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.291
I will never support the underground.

657
00:45:41.083 --> 00:45:42.125
But I support you.

658
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:46.041
You've gotta choose.

659
00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:49.291
Are you fighters or whatever this is?

660
00:45:49.375 --> 00:45:50.916
Because if you train in this gym.

661
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.500
it has to be as professionals.

662
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:56.416
Mixing business with pleasure
didn't work out for you last time.

663
00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.958
And in the cage.
a fraction of a second of distraction

664
00:46:01.833 --> 00:46:03.083
can get you killed.

665
00:46:12.916 --> 00:46:14.291
Nice!

666
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.250
Yes! Nice.

667
00:46:48.458 --> 00:46:52.291
-You see how he's coming…
-Come on. Breathe.

668
00:47:09.875 --> 00:47:12.000
-Hey.
-Sienna.

669
00:47:12.083 --> 00:47:13.875
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

670
00:47:13.958 --> 00:47:17.000
-I'm just happy you're here.
-Of course.

671
00:47:17.083 --> 00:47:19.708
You actually just missed my mom.
She's been dying to meet you.

672
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:21.583
-Really?
-Yeah. Kayden may have

673
00:47:21.666 --> 00:47:23.625
mentioned your name once or twice.

674
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:28.375
-No pressure. No.
-No pressure.

675
00:47:30.291 --> 00:47:32.250
Here's the dress we picked.

676
00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:34.833
-Wow.
-Yeah.

677
00:47:34.916 --> 00:47:38.000
But one of my bridesmaids

678
00:47:38.083 --> 00:47:40.666
asked if she could design the dresses.

679
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.208
-Good one.
-Gotcha.

680
00:47:42.291 --> 00:47:44.208
-Now this is beautiful.
-Way better. right?

681
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:45.708
Yes.

682
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:47.958
I thought you'd look great
in this neckline.

683
00:47:49.125 --> 00:47:50.458
You know what? This one's fine.

684
00:47:50.541 --> 00:47:52.291
This one's actually better than fine.

685
00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:53.833
-Mm.
-Yep.

686
00:47:53.916 --> 00:47:55.416
You didn't care to mention this?

687
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.208
I love you both. and it's my big day.

688
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:02.291
So deal with it. okay? Thank you.

689
00:48:09.458 --> 00:48:11.750
Look. I'm sorry you feel betrayed--

690
00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:13.625
That's not a good way to start an apology.

691
00:48:13.708 --> 00:48:15.750
dodging responsibility.

692
00:48:15.833 --> 00:48:19.458
Okay. I am sorry I betrayed you.

693
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:23.208
I know how much you sacrificed
to make sure I was okay.

694
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:26.166
But. Sienna.
it has been so hard living in your shadow.

695
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:29.416
and Jax was the first person
to pay attention to me.

696
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.958
I'm just trying to figure out who I am.

697
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.500
By what? Being tied up and degraded?

698
00:48:35.583 --> 00:48:36.833
He asks if I want it.

699
00:48:36.916 --> 00:48:38.416
But you don't know what you want. Beth.

700
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.875
-You're 18!
-Oh. and you do?

701
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:42.416
I don't! Uh. no. I don't!

702
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.416
I know there's a difference
between liking it rough

703
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.416
and manipulating women to serve your ego.

704
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.000
You know. Si. it's not about you.
Just stay out of it.

705
00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:50.583
Beth. it's not about you either.

706
00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:52.416
This is about Jax

707
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.791
and the pleasure he gets
from taking our power.

708
00:48:55.875 --> 00:48:58.375
He loves me.

709
00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:02.625
I knew what she was going through

710
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:05.250
and that it was gonna get worse.

711
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:07.583
But when you're that far gone.

712
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:10.083
only you can decide
when you're ready for help.

713
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.708
You carb-loading there. lucky?

714
00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:27.208
Don't worry about it.
Why aren't you at the gym?

715
00:49:27.291 --> 00:49:30.000
-Miss me?
-I already put in eight hours today.

716
00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:32.291
I'm supposed to take the next 24 off.

717
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.333
Unless. of course. you changed your mind
about having a rest day.

718
00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:36.916
No. Definitely not.

719
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.000
You okay?

720
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.416
-Great.
-Yeah?

721
00:49:48.625 --> 00:49:51.375
Uh. listen.

722
00:49:53.083 --> 00:49:55.208
I'm here if you want
to talk about anything.

723
00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:01.875
It's just Beth.

724
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:06.208
I swear. it's like she's living
on another fucking planet.

725
00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:09.166
Like. in what world
does she not see what he's doing?

726
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.833
She saw what he did to me.

727
00:50:11.916 --> 00:50:14.708
chipping away at my self-esteem
and gaslighting me.

728
00:50:20.708 --> 00:50:22.291
Uh. I'll get this one.

729
00:50:29.083 --> 00:50:32.000
-Who is that?
-It's no one.

730
00:50:32.083 --> 00:50:33.208
Oh. come on. Kayden.

731
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:36.000
I open up to you.
and you're still a vault?

732
00:50:36.083 --> 00:50:38.833
Good to see the dynamic duo
back together again.

733
00:50:38.916 --> 00:50:40.333
Can I get you anything?

734
00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:48.500
I know you two are low-key
fight clubbing it.

735
00:50:48.583 --> 00:50:50.875
and it's kind of cool
to know people that are so hard.

736
00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:53.583
But do you have to be so hard
on each other?

737
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.083
Why did it bother me so much
that Kayden wouldn't let me in?

738
00:51:35.166 --> 00:51:39.000
His whole brooding.
mysterious thing was getting to me.

739
00:51:39.083 --> 00:51:42.125
But. no. we were in this to beat Jax.

740
00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:44.833
It was purely a business transaction.

741
00:51:44.916 --> 00:51:46.458
and that's all I wanted.

742
00:51:46.541 --> 00:51:48.000
-Hey.
-Right?

743
00:51:48.083 --> 00:51:49.583
Sienna.

744
00:51:49.666 --> 00:51:52.291
Hey. Sienna.

745
00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:54.916
It's me!

746
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.125
I could have snapped your wrist.

747
00:51:58.208 --> 00:51:59.833
Were you-- have you been following me?

748
00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:03.500
No. Yeah. Uh--

749
00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:10.541
I'm sorry I got mad.

750
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.791
I mean. don't. Don't do that.

751
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:19.625
-Do what?
-That. That-- that look.

752
00:52:19.708 --> 00:52:21.416
-What? That's my face.
-I…

753
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.708
I know. It's just…

754
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:41.416
You're the last thing on my mind at night.

755
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.666
The first thing in the morning.

756
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:47.000
You are the smartest.

757
00:52:47.083 --> 00:52:49.416
strongest. most insanely stubborn.

758
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.166
beautiful force of a woman
I have ever met.

759
00:52:53.291 --> 00:52:55.208
and it kills me knowing
that I can't give you

760
00:52:55.291 --> 00:52:57.583
everything that you deserve.

761
00:52:57.666 --> 00:53:00.750
Kayden. people are allowed to change…

762
00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:06.958
…grow. make mistakes. and then move on.

763
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.625
Whatever it is that you've gone through

764
00:53:10.708 --> 00:53:13.333
that's made the person
standing in front of me.

765
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.708
it's enough.

766
00:53:18.416 --> 00:53:20.083
You're enough.

767
00:53:49.708 --> 00:53:51.500
Tell me to stop and I will.

768
00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:53.041
No way.

769
00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:46.083
Julian's gonna kill us.

770
00:55:47.916 --> 00:55:49.291
Not if he doesn't know.

771
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.916
He'll know.

772
00:56:39.916 --> 00:56:42.958
Um. we can just pretend it never happened

773
00:56:43.041 --> 00:56:46.708
if you have regrets or anything.

774
00:56:51.833 --> 00:56:54.125
What? No.

775
00:56:56.916 --> 00:57:01.416
The cheese-- cheese is still melting.

776
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.708
but you should try this.

777
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:06.916
-Hot.
-Mm.

778
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.583
It is my take on migas.

779
00:57:09.958 --> 00:57:11.625
-Mmm.
-Yep.

780
00:57:11.708 --> 00:57:13.666
Homemade tortilla chips.
caramelized onions.

781
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.416
peppers. eggs.

782
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.583
anything really
that I want to put on there.

783
00:57:17.666 --> 00:57:19.250
Oh. you want cilantro?

784
00:57:19.333 --> 00:57:20.750
No. Never.

785
00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:23.083
Really?

786
00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:24.833
-You like cilantro?
-I love cilantro.

787
00:57:24.916 --> 00:57:28.000
-Oh. no.
-You think you know someone.

788
00:57:28.083 --> 00:57:31.083
Well. I didn't know you were such a chef.

789
00:57:31.166 --> 00:57:35.708
Yeah. uh. it's what I wanted
to be when I was younger.

790
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:39.375
It's just not the same cooking for one.

791
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.833
Well. you're really good at it.

792
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:46.500
When I woke up I realized…

793
00:57:48.083 --> 00:57:50.291
…I don't want just one night with you.

794
00:57:51.541 --> 00:57:52.708
But…

795
00:57:58.166 --> 00:57:59.291
No buts.

796
00:58:23.916 --> 00:58:25.708
All right. go.

797
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:18.333
That's it. Light on your feet.

798
00:59:20.083 --> 00:59:22.625
-You're late.
-Sorry. boss. uh. we--

799
00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:25.541
Got caught up in each other?
Forgot what you're meant to be doing?

800
00:59:25.625 --> 00:59:28.833
I mean. if you're not gonna take this
seriously. find somewhere else to train.

801
00:59:28.916 --> 00:59:30.583
-Come on.
-Okay? I gave you the conditions. okay?

802
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:32.000
I said keep it professional.

803
00:59:32.083 --> 00:59:33.583
But you didn't do that. did you?

804
00:59:33.666 --> 00:59:36.458
We've been down this road before. Sienna.

805
00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:40.625
Julian. come on.

806
00:59:40.708 --> 00:59:42.833
Give me a jab. Jab cross.

807
00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:44.750
Look. I really do need your help.

808
00:59:44.833 --> 00:59:46.708
You don't know what you need.

809
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:48.333
And somebody is gonna get hurt. Sienna.

810
00:59:48.416 --> 00:59:50.458
Sir. this is just as much
my fault as it is hers.

811
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:51.875
Hey. this is between us.

812
00:59:51.958 --> 00:59:54.291
Jab. Switch.

813
00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:58.791
Oh. nice shot.

814
00:59:58.875 --> 00:59:59.875
Come on.

815
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.958
Julian. I'm really sorry.

816
01:00:06.041 --> 01:00:07.708
I am.

817
01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:09.416
Did you see Jax's fight the other night?

818
01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:15.833
It's all over the Internet.

819
01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.583
Oh!

820
01:00:33.833 --> 01:00:37.708
…to take on Kayden "The Killer" Williams!

821
01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:40.208
You really want to be a part of this?

822
01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:41.958
You're gonna get yourself killed.

823
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.000
You got one week.

824
01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:48.125
Are you ready to send him into that?

825
01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:51.916
We'll be ready.

826
01:00:57.041 --> 01:01:00.833
Buckle down and you can stay.

827
01:01:00.916 --> 01:01:02.708
but no more warnings.

828
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.541
Uh-huh.

829
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.625
Nice. Yep. down.

830
01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:39.083
Nice.

831
01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.541
That's good.

832
01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:03.541
Hey. can you give us a hand for a sec?

833
01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:05.250
Yeah. sure. Keep going.

834
01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:07.166
Make sure you switch up the angles.

835
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.000
Okay. this is Athena.
She's got a fight coming up.

836
01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:12.541
I wanna get her on her feet.

837
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah. Sure.

838
01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:21.333
Okay. ladies. you ready?

839
01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:23.875
Okay. touch gloves.

840
01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:25.166
And go!

841
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.500
Bring her to you. Athena.

842
01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:37.125
Cover.

843
01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:40.916
Use the ring.

844
01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:45.458
Step back.

845
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:50.333
Watch those leg kicks and don't project.

846
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:11.333
Nice. Good kick.

847
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.416
Keep your guard up.

848
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.625
Cover. Come on.

849
01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.708
Athena. use the fence.

850
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.958
Keep going. The foot--

851
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.708
Take her to ground.

852
01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:40.541
Okay. get off the ropes.

853
01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:44.083
Come on. take it.

854
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.833
Fight your way out.

855
01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:21.708
Good fight.

856
01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:30.625
What?

857
01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:35.208
-It's nothing.
-It was nothing?

858
01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:37.166
She's won all three fights this year.

859
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.708
You just took her down.

860
01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:43.708
It's nothing.

861
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.666
Well. let me know when
you're ready to get serious.

862
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.083
I didn't say stop.

863
01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:09.500
Wow.

864
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.666
Need some help?

865
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.208
Yeah. you know how to do this?

866
01:05:23.291 --> 01:05:26.000
No. not really.

867
01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:28.208
But I YouTubed it.

868
01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:30.916
so let's see.

869
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Mm-hmm.

870
01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.083
This one goes behind.

871
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.708
Across.

872
01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:43.916
There.

873
01:05:49.916 --> 01:05:50.916
All right.

874
01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:59.875
Look at you. Look at you.

875
01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:09.041
I'm really glad we stayed
for the reception.

876
01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:13.208
Slink off to the shadows
when things get social?

877
01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:14.625
-It's not me.
-Oh. yeah.

878
01:06:14.708 --> 01:06:16.416
-You? I'm very social.
-No.

879
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.208
Oh. yeah. definitely.

880
01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.083
I've missed this.

881
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.916
I'm here.

882
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.291
Forever?

883
01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:34.083
I mean it.

884
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.291
Do you really see that happening for us?

885
01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.500
Go big or go home. lucky.

886
01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:00.083
There she is.

887
01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:03.708
You clean up nice. princess.

888
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.500
Come on. I can't even get a hello?

889
01:07:10.291 --> 01:07:13.291
-Did Beth invite you?
-Beth?

890
01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:17.208
-I'm kidding.
-Ha. ha.

891
01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:19.416
Women are disposable.
You're a real comedian.

892
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.875
Si. now that's what I love about you.

893
01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:24.041
Never afraid to tell it like it is.

894
01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:26.291
I miss that fire.

895
01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:32.291
I don't know. maybe this wedding stuff
is making me all sentimental.

896
01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:36.500
-This was supposed to be us.
-Mm.

897
01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:41.625
Me and you? Rebel champions?

898
01:07:41.708 --> 01:07:45.333
Rebels stand for something.
You can't even stand up.

899
01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:47.083
Okay. Jax. you need to go home.

900
01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:51.125
Sienna. Sienna. I know I'm not perfect.

901
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:55.541
Neither of us were. But we were good.

902
01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.083
We could be great.

903
01:07:58.708 --> 01:07:59.916
I know it.

904
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.625
How many times
do I have to tell you I'm done?

905
01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:07.291
It's kinda mixed signals
when you keep coming back.

906
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.333
Well. consider this me breaking the cycle.

907
01:08:12.125 --> 01:08:14.125
-What's going on. Sienna?
-Come on. let's just go.

908
01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:16.958
You know she's just using you
to get back at me. right?

909
01:08:17.041 --> 01:08:20.208
What. are you hurt?

910
01:08:20.291 --> 01:08:22.000
You thought there was something more?

911
01:08:22.083 --> 01:08:23.291
That's not how she operates.

912
01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.416
She may look like she's on the sidelines.

913
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.250
-but she's the one calling the shots.
-Jax. stop.

914
01:08:27.333 --> 01:08:30.000
You're a pawn. dude.
I'll prove it to you right now.

915
01:08:30.083 --> 01:08:31.750
-Fight me.
-Let's go.

916
01:08:31.833 --> 01:08:33.958
See if she sticks around afterwards.

917
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.958
I'm not gonna fight you. man.
This is a wedding.

918
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:39.208
Respect the families.
Save it for tomorrow.

919
01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:41.125
The fuck do you know
about respecting family?

920
01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:43.708
Killed yours. didn't you? Your mom. right?

921
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:52.125
-Motherfucker.
-Hey!

922
01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:12.208
-Get off.
-Dude. Hey. calm down.

923
01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:15.625
-Fuck!
-Go on. Get out of here.

924
01:09:15.708 --> 01:09:17.625
Get over here. I'll fucking kill you.

925
01:09:23.458 --> 01:09:25.625
-No!
-You need to get out.

926
01:09:25.708 --> 01:09:27.250
Get off me!

927
01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:29.416
-Let me see. Let me see.
-Kayden!

928
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.416
You guys enjoying the show?

929
01:09:38.666 --> 01:09:41.083
Seriously. dude. what is wrong with you?

930
01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:46.208
-Kayden. Kayden. wait!
-Fuck that guy.

931
01:09:46.291 --> 01:09:48.625
He doesn't know
anything about me or my mom

932
01:09:48.708 --> 01:09:51.625
-or my life or any--
-Neither do I.

933
01:09:51.708 --> 01:09:55.125
So talk to me. Tell me.

934
01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.541
That's my mom. okay?

935
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.916
She raised me by herself.

936
01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:12.833
She worked three jobs
to keep food on the table.

937
01:10:12.916 --> 01:10:14.250
and I was just a piece of shit.

938
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.208
One night. I got really drunk at a party.

939
01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:20.083
and. uh. she left work to come find me.

940
01:10:20.166 --> 01:10:23.375
and on the way
she got hit by a drunk driver.

941
01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:26.625
-And just like that. gone.
-You couldn't have known--

942
01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:30.041
And everything that she did for me?
That's how I repaid her.

943
01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.833
Now I'm just a high school dropout

944
01:10:31.916 --> 01:10:33.625
that gets beat up in
underground fights for money.

945
01:10:33.708 --> 01:10:35.750
She'd be really proud of that.
wouldn't she?

946
01:10:39.833 --> 01:10:43.208
What do you want from me. Sienna?

947
01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:45.833
I put everything that I have
into these fights.

948
01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:49.833
Everything. What do you want?

949
01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:52.833
'Cause I have nothing left to give.

950
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.375
and I am not gonna be
another person's charity case.

951
01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:59.083
You're not a charity case. Kayden.

952
01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.833
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't! No. no. no.

953
01:11:03.916 --> 01:11:07.708
No. no.
That is the last thing I want-- pity.

954
01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:11.125
Definitely not yours.

955
01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:16.458
from the way you pity yourself so much
it keeps you chasing that asshole.

956
01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:18.500
Excuse me?

957
01:11:18.583 --> 01:11:22.166
You think you're so tough.
but you're just hiding.

958
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:25.000
Oh. says-- says the brave hero

959
01:11:25.083 --> 01:11:26.875
just locked up in a basement

960
01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.958
haunted by his own ghost waiting to die.

961
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:32.625
You forced your way into my life!

962
01:11:32.708 --> 01:11:35.000
I didn't ask for that.
and I don't need you.

963
01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:38.000
Really? You don't need me? Because
the last fight before me. you lost.

964
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:39.916
-Wait.
-Ouch.

965
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.708
-That feels broken.
-Don't.

966
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:48.208
I'm gonna do this on my own.
Don't come tomorrow.

967
01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:51.000
Tomorrow? What?
You can't fight with a broken rib.

968
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.000
What does it matter to you if I lose?

969
01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:56.416
'Cause we don't have anything
after tomorrow. do we?

970
01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:09.708
Have fun on your suicide mission!

971
01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:15.291
Fuck.

972
01:13:00.958 --> 01:13:02.708
You heading out?

973
01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.375
You're a professional. Sienna.

974
01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:12.875
We don't abandon our fighters.

975
01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:15.625
Let's get through this fight.

976
01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:17.791
and then we'll focus on the next chapter.

977
01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:20.708
But tonight he needs you.

978
01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.916
-You need a hand?
-Julian.

979
01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.833
I thought you didn't want
anyone to know about this.

980
01:13:46.916 --> 01:13:48.208
Well. you know. fuck 'em.

981
01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:58.625
Hey. what the hell happened?
That's a crack.

982
01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:00.958
You can't fight like that.

983
01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:02.625
Pacquiao did it. I'll be fine.

984
01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:05.208
You know. if he gets a hit in.
it'll puncture a lung.

985
01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:08.416
-It could be fatal.
-Then I better not let him hit me.

986
01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:14.333
Next up. The Killer!

987
01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.708
You have any last words of advice?

988
01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.625
Win.

989
01:14:20.541 --> 01:14:24.000
-You got this. man.
-You got this. Killer. Come on. man.

990
01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:27.000
Kayden "The Killer" Williams
makes his way to the cage

991
01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:30.208
to face off Jax "Deadbeat" Deneris

992
01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:33.416
in the showdown of the century!

993
01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:43.416
Come on. brother. you got this!
You got this!

994
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.791
Come on. brother!

995
01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:45.875
This is it. folks.

996
01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:48.166
the moment you've been waiting for!

997
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.708
Ready?

998
01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:53.041
Yo! Oh. that was dirty!

999
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:05.416
-Stay ahead. Nice.
-Hey.

1000
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.416
Hey. I didn't think you'd come
after last night.

1001
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.250
I didn't think so either.

1002
01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:12.333
but I couldn't let him do it alone.

1003
01:15:18.916 --> 01:15:21.208
I'm sorry we ruined the night.

1004
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:23.083
You didn't. Jax did.

1005
01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:25.583
Kayden! Get off the cage! Cover up!

1006
01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:28.416
-Come on!
-Off the cage!

1007
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.500
-Come on!
-Come on. Kayden.

1008
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.708
-Off the cage!
-Find the opening!

1009
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:38.416
Hold him! Don't let him go!

1010
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.291
-Hold that.
-Squeeze. squeeze.

1011
01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:47.916
Come on! Squeeze!

1012
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.666
Watch the leg. Watch the leg.

1013
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:53.750
Come on!

1014
01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:56.125
There you go!

1015
01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:58.000
Come on.

1016
01:16:16.541 --> 01:16:18.875
His ribs!

1017
01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:22.041
You can do better than that.

1018
01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:23.708
Come on. Killer. Get up!

1019
01:16:23.791 --> 01:16:26.250
-Kayden. you're okay. It's his ribs.
-Aw. Kayden…

1020
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:30.291
This is your guy?
He's the best you got at UFG?

1021
01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:32.083
Come on. Kayden. you're okay.

1022
01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:38.708
Breathe.

1023
01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:42.416
This guy? This guy?

1024
01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:49.083
I thought you came to fight. Killer.

1025
01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:56.625
In that moment.
I realized it didn't matter anymore

1026
01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:58.500
whether we beat Jax.

1027
01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:01.750
We had each other.

1028
01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:06.125
We'd already won.

1029
01:17:13.333 --> 01:17:16.500
Killer's back on his feet.

1030
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.125
He's not ready to give up.

1031
01:17:21.666 --> 01:17:23.916
-Nice! Off the cage!
-You got this. Stay grounded!

1032
01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:06.750
Go.

1033
01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:16.000
Yes!

1034
01:18:16.083 --> 01:18:17.625
The Killer wins!

1035
01:18:17.708 --> 01:18:21.125
Yes!

1036
01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:23.333
The defending champion…

1037
01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:26.625
Remember when I said
winning didn't matter?

1038
01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:27.708
I meant it.

1039
01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:31.500
But. damn. this felt good.

1040
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:37.291
Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer!

1041
01:18:38.416 --> 01:18:40.208
You did it.

1042
01:18:40.291 --> 01:18:41.708
We did it.

1043
01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:48.625
And this felt even better.

1044
01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:01.750
Killer!

1045
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.000
Oh. my God. Is she breathing?

1046
01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.916
Sienna. Come on.

1047
01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:17.291
Please. please. please. don't do this.

1048
01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:19.166
Fuck. man. Fuck!

1049
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.958
Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!

1050
01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:33.750
Dr. Robertson to the ER immediately.

1051
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:14.583
You guys. she's up.

1052
01:20:15.791 --> 01:20:18.083
Sienna. can you hear me?

1053
01:20:18.166 --> 01:20:21.333
It's Beth. I'm right here.

1054
01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.375
You've been out for. like. three days.

1055
01:20:26.166 --> 01:20:28.083
Can we-- can we get you anything?

1056
01:20:30.666 --> 01:20:33.125
Go on your honeymoon.

1057
01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:38.583
We got her. Go. It's fine.

1058
01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:49.000
-You're gonna be okay.
-Where is he?

1059
01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:52.583
He waited
until you were in the clear. but…

1060
01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:56.916
He left you this.

1061
01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:15.458
I've always known there's danger
in loving someone too much.

1062
01:21:15.541 --> 01:21:18.041
the daily sacrifices
that turn into so much more.

1063
01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.333
It's okay.

1064
01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.416
Holding you in my arms.

1065
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.833
I saw what I was doing to you.

1066
01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:28.375
and I know that if--
when you come back from this.

1067
01:21:29.291 --> 01:21:31.208
you'll continue to put yourself
in my shadow

1068
01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.625
just as you did with Jax.

1069
01:21:33.708 --> 01:21:35.791
You deserve so much more than that.

1070
01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:39.291
and I can be a part of holding you back.

1071
01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:43.291
You're one of the great ones. Sienna.

1072
01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:03.208
Hey.

1073
01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.291
Looks like our roles are reversed. huh?

1074
01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:14.833
You gonna nurse me back to health?

1075
01:22:14.916 --> 01:22:17.541
If you want.

1076
01:22:17.625 --> 01:22:19.000
I'll be here for you every day.

1077
01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:23.458
Seriously? You could've
saved yourself the trip.

1078
01:22:24.791 --> 01:22:27.291
No. it's not actually why I'm here.

1079
01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.833
but you did ask.

1080
01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:32.375
-You saw an opening?
-Pretty much.

1081
01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:36.291
Cookie?

1082
01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:43.916
Okay.

1083
01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:48.916
I. um…

1084
01:22:53.541 --> 01:22:55.625
I came to say that I'm sorry.

1085
01:22:56.708 --> 01:22:58.208
It was an accident.

1086
01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:00.208
I didn't see you. Sienna.

1087
01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:02.708
And by the time that I did see you…

1088
01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:07.208
The thought that I could've killed you…

1089
01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:10.375
Yeah. You could have.

1090
01:23:15.583 --> 01:23:17.708
But I…

1091
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:23.666
I forgive you for everything.

1092
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:27.458
-I love you.
-No. you don't.

1093
01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:30.875
You took my anger.
and you tried to control me with it.

1094
01:23:30.958 --> 01:23:35.333
and you called that love.
and that's not what love is.

1095
01:23:35.416 --> 01:23:38.291
But that doesn't mean
that you can never find it.

1096
01:23:40.083 --> 01:23:42.833
You just have to look
inside yourself. Jax.

1097
01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.625
Just try to fix
what's broken inside of you

1098
01:23:48.541 --> 01:23:50.583
and stop trying to break other people

1099
01:23:50.666 --> 01:23:52.291
to make yourself feel whole.

1100
01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:57.333
Can I ask you something?

1101
01:23:57.416 --> 01:23:59.708
You think there's still a chance?

1102
01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:02.000
Of what?

1103
01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:04.958
For me to be redeemed?

1104
01:24:07.583 --> 01:24:09.541
No one is beyond redemption.

1105
01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:14.333
But I wouldn't bet my money on it.

1106
01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:17.166
Yeah.

1107
01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:28.916
You're probably right.

1108
01:24:37.708 --> 01:24:41.500
It hurt. hearing those words.

1109
01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:44.250
feeling abandoned.

1110
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.708
but it hurt even more
knowing he was right.

1111
01:24:50.916 --> 01:24:52.250
The first step in recovery

1112
01:24:52.333 --> 01:24:54.958
is admitting you have a problem.

1113
01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:59.125
I was an addict.

1114
01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:06.583
I'd been obsessed with Jax.
convinced it was love.

1115
01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.083
and my need for revenge

1116
01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:10.625
had thrown me even further off track.

1117
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:14.000
With Kayden it felt different.

1118
01:25:14.083 --> 01:25:15.625
but I was still fighting for others

1119
01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:17.458
when I needed to fight for myself.

1120
01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:25.291
I'd lost sight of who I was.

1121
01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:27.500
what I wanted.

1122
01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:54.166
I wasn't one to forget.

1123
01:25:54.958 --> 01:25:57.125
but it cost me nothing to forgive.

1124
01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:05.958
All right.

1125
01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:09.750
-Not gourmet. but here you go.
-Thank you.

1126
01:26:09.833 --> 01:26:13.458
-Mm-hmm.
-I like your hair.

1127
01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:16.708
-It's very me. right?
-Yeah.

1128
01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:28.375
I ended things with Jax.

1129
01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:33.416
Well. aren't you gonna say I told you so?

1130
01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.791
I'm so proud of you.

1131
01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:43.166
Thanks. Si.

1132
01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:46.750
Now you've gotta focus on yourself.

1133
01:26:47.625 --> 01:26:48.958
I am.

1134
01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:01.208
Hey. whoa! Easy there. killer.

1135
01:27:01.291 --> 01:27:02.875
Hey. I'm not Killer.

1136
01:27:02.958 --> 01:27:06.666
-What'd he call you? Lucky?
-Exactly. It's ironic.

1137
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:09.958
-Go again?
-Slow and steady.

1138
01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:27.541
I'll give you a minute.

1139
01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:39.416
-You look good up there.
-That? I was just warming up.

1140
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.166
Heard you were in Philly.

1141
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:44.916
Yeah. Yeah. I have an uncle up there.

1142
01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:47.916
I'm glad it worked out for you.

1143
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.208
I just figured you be better off

1144
01:27:50.291 --> 01:27:52.791
if I wasn't here messing everything up.

1145
01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:57.125
-How selfless.
-I know. I know.

1146
01:27:57.208 --> 01:27:59.666
Now I know that running away

1147
01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:02.541
was exactly the wrong thing to do.

1148
01:28:03.541 --> 01:28:05.583
And I was a coward.

1149
01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:08.458
I'm sorry.

1150
01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:12.666
I'm sorry that I ran away
when you needed me the most.

1151
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:15.166
And if you can't forgive me. that's okay.

1152
01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:17.708
I just want what's best for you.

1153
01:28:20.708 --> 01:28:23.375
I love you. Sienna.

1154
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.416
I'm happy you're fighting.

1155
01:28:30.291 --> 01:28:33.083
I'd wish you luck. but who needs it when
they got your skills?

1156
01:28:37.583 --> 01:28:39.458
I read your letter.

1157
01:28:42.541 --> 01:28:44.416
I'm not gonna lie. I was so mad.

1158
01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.791
But I was just holding on to that anger
towards Jax.

1159
01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:51.833
and it was holding me back.

1160
01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:57.125
So. I don't know.
maybe I should be thanking you.

1161
01:28:57.208 --> 01:29:02.916
Well. no. but. um. you know what I mean.

1162
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.041
I'm not doing the underground
thing anymore.

1163
01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:10.833
I applied to school in the fall.

1164
01:29:10.916 --> 01:29:13.083
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1165
01:29:13.166 --> 01:29:15.833
-That's really good.
-Yeah.

1166
01:29:15.916 --> 01:29:19.291
Um. in Philly?

1167
01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:22.541
Springfield.

1168
01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:27.208
So if you happen to know anyone

1169
01:29:27.291 --> 01:29:30.416
with a cheap room to rent.

1170
01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.083
I'd love a recommendation.

1171
01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:38.583
How's it going. Julian?

1172
01:29:38.666 --> 01:29:41.291
Well. it's still slow.

1173
01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.958
but I appreciate you
leaving me what you did.

1174
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:46.250
It's not a fight
that I wanted any credit for.

1175
01:29:46.333 --> 01:29:49.166
but it's been keeping my lights on.

1176
01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:53.208
putting off the inevitable. I suppose.

1177
01:29:53.291 --> 01:29:55.291
Not if you have a champion.

1178
01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:58.208
You thinking about turning pro?

1179
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.916
Not him.

1180
01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.500
Me.
