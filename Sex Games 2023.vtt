3
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:06.454
Relax.

4
00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:08.082
Breathe in.

5
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.210
Breathe out.

6
00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.089
Is this how hypnosis
is supposed to be. Doc?

7
00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:17.066
- Do you know what you’re doi-
- Shut up.

8
00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.151
Just do as I say.

9
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.176
Now.

10
00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.853
you are feeling drowsy.

11
00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:27.434
Your eyelids feel heavier and heavier…

12
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.482
You will follow my every command.

13
00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.986
Say my name.

14
00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:39.738
Doc Delgado.

15
00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:42.199
Now say your name.

16
00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:45.936
Monica Salanga.

17
00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:48.999
Raise your left hand.

18
00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:54.926
Lower your left hand.

19
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:58.269
Nod.

20
00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:03.134
Undress.

21
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:13.423
Take off your bra.

22
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.496
Open your eyes.

23
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.544
Worship me.

24
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.687
Please me.

25
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.424
Say you love it.

26
00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:47.551
I'm loving it.

27
00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:08.197
Doc?

28
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
Doc!

29
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.323
Doc!

30
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:12.325
Doc!

31
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.409
Doc!

32
00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:18.557
Doc. I’m your patient.
This is wrong.

33
00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:19.833
This is wrong.

34
00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.187
This is wrong.

35
00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:24.656
This is wrong.

36
00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.841
Slowly. Doc.

37
00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:29.218
Stop. Doc.

38
00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:32.404
This is wrong.

39
00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.780
Faster!

40
00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.421
Faster!

41
00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.518
Faster. Doc!

42
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:38.518
Please. Doc!

43
00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:43.607
Stop. Doc!

44
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.693
Feels good. Doc.

45
00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.944
That was fast.

46
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.909
I wanted it to last longer.

47
00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:58.634
That bit where you suddenly woke up
made it exciting.

48
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:05.629
I think this is more fun
than acting in sexy movies.

49
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.634
You really look like a doctor.

50
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.311
A doctor abusing his power.

51
00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:19.685
And you fit the role
of a patient perfectly.

52
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.452
You’re stiff as a rock.

53
00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.357
Stiff?

54
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:30.195
You mean I got you stiff in no time!

55
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.283
Anyway. I liked this more than

56
00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:40.747
our "priest and confessing whore" routine.

57
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.000
That was too predictable.

58
00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:45.586
You're an expert at kneeling.

59
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.044
Plus.

60
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.423
you have too many sins to confess.

61
00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:51.966
Wow.

62
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.596
Says the saint.

63
00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.557
Oh. I also like the one
where you’re gay.

64
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.618
And you’re a lesbian.

65
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:02.978
That was fun.

66
00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:08.442
What about when
you were a yoga instructor?

67
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.194
Because I bend over so well?

68
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.404
No.

69
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.658
Because no position is too hard for you.

70
00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:19.484
Even taking a dick on a headstand.

71
00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:38.593
Remember when we were the couple
who revolted against Spain?

72
00:10:39.348 --> 00:10:40.348
I like that.

73
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.435
I like the part
where you used a dagger.

74
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:44.435
But-

75
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.975
It didn’t work.

76
00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:49.398
Because you have no sense of history.

77
00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:52.127
You can stuff your sense
of history up your ass!

78
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.530
I can play any role.

79
00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:56.477
Really?

80
00:10:56.502 --> 00:10:58.023
Of course.

81
00:10:58.297 --> 00:11:01.678
I was shooting this scene one time.

82
00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.538
I was the house maid.

83
00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.501
My employer’s son was supposed
to ravage me on the stairs.

84
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.671
Problem was. my co-actor was a newbie.

85
00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:12.531
Didn’t want to take off his clothes.

86
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.757
Wanna know what I did?

87
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.050
What?

88
00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:21.296
I grabbed his balls.
He was butt-naked in no time!

89
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:57.008
I’ll double the pay.

90
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.420
Hey. open up!
What are you doing there?

91
00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:29.740
This is getting boring.

92
00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:34.147
We could go home
and just order pizza.

93
00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:39.756
I’ve had my fill of pizza delivery boys.

94
00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.031
Why is it always my idea anyway?

95
00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:45.001
Think of something for a change!

96
00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.256
Sex with a cadaver.

97
00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:53.183
You murdered the joke.

98
00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.043
It works only if delivered deadpan.

99
00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:02.842
So-

100
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.971
You said something riskier?

101
00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:12.394
Once. Debbie suggested
that we kidnap someone.

102
00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.772
I refused. We’re not criminals.

103
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.983
We just want to have fun.

104
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.388
Another time. someone
almost lost their life.

105
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.835
How did that happen?

106
00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.495
I picked up a trans woman.

107
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.791
Debbie challenged me
to have sex with a trans woman.

108
00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:40.772
Debbie. Francine.

109
00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:41.715
Francine. Debbie.

110
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:42.756
Hi!

111
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:43.985
I thought it was just
going to be the two of us.

112
00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:44.718
No.

113
00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.361
It’s more fun if it’s the three of us.

114
00:14:46.444 --> 00:14:48.154
Hi. I’m Debbie.

115
00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:51.435
We assured her
that Debbie was just going to watch.

116
00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.060
Is that real?

117
00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:55.745
Yeah.

118
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.796
- Can I feel it?
- Go ahead.

119
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.192
Oh. it is real.

120
00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:02.944
It’s real.

121
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.657
It’s so real.

122
00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:08.783
How about that?

123
00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:11.686
Is it still a dick
or is it already a pussy?

124
00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.582
Just touch it.

125
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.086
It’s big.

126
00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:21.546
It’s big!

127
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:56.831
Here. drink.

128
00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.750
You mentioned before that
Debbie always liked wearing white.

129
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.643
This. too.

130
00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:00.668
Yes.

131
00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.237
Correct. It’s her favorite.

132
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.548
She is obsessed with whiteness.

133
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.968
That’s why our house. inside and out.
is pure white.

134
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.764
I don’t know what it was.
maybe she had a condition.

135
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:38.832
What’s happening?

136
00:16:38.857 --> 00:16:40.734
All of a sudden
she was having a seizure.

137
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.019
Bobby!

138
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:43.753
Bobby!

139
00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:44.963
Francine?

140
00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.046
Francine!

141
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.256
Francine!

142
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.844
Bobby. I think we killed her!

143
00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.596
Bobby. do something!

144
00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:55.326
Do something!

145
00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.701
Do something!

146
00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.020
We tried everything
but she wouldn’t wake up.

147
00:17:00.996 --> 00:17:02.706
I thought we’d killed someone.

148
00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:03.815
Francine!

149
00:17:08.022 --> 00:17:09.935
Where am I?

150
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:13.462
Just leave!

151
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.618
Here are your clothes.

152
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.015
Sorry.

153
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.666
I have a condition.

154
00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:24.345
It's your fault. It must have
been the pill you gave me.

155
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.714
We had the driver
take her home immediately.

156
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:35.305
I told Debbie we should stop
involving other people.

157
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.559
But she said that
was part of the fun.

158
00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:41.936
And she got her way.

159
00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.274
From then on we’d find people online.

160
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.193
How long have you been married?

161
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.652
Ten years.

162
00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:54.491
The first two. three years. we’re okay.

163
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.242
We’re so in love.

164
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.652
Even when it was just
the two of us at home.

165
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:02.916
Having sex.

166
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.460
watching movies.

167
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.671
or traveling together. anywhere.

168
00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:11.591
Then. it got boring.

169
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.096
I could see the restlessness in her eyes.

170
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.600
That’s when we started
what we called our sex games.

171
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.110
We had such fun.

172
00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.990
I suppose all married couples
do it at one time or another.

173
00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.539
But in your case.
you involved other people at times.

174
00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:45.725
Yes.

175
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.420
And it got out of bounds. just like
what happened to the trans woman.

176
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.760
Something else happened-

177
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.222
Just last year. in fact.

178
00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:04.602
Debbie and I had a fight.

179
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.523
Something to do with
one of our properties.

180
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.067
It was actually my fault.

181
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:12.777
I apologized.

182
00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.989
Eventually. she forgave me.

183
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:18.115
Or so I thought.

184
00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:23.413
Because Debbie never really forgives.

185
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.583
She never forgets.

186
00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.752
She must always get even.

187
00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.834
At one of our sex games.

188
00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:36.835
Debbie provided me with a girl.

189
00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.636
A virgin. she said.

190
00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.264
For whom she paid
a high price. she said.

191
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:47.270
We did it in the old stockroom.
To make it cinematic. she said.

192
00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:52.650
She told us both
to wear blindfolds.

193
00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:54.319
“What for?” I asked her.

194
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:58.531
She said it was an experiment
on seeing and not seeing.

195
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:03.369
Besides. it would heighten
the pleasure. she said.

196
00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.582
No! No. please!

197
00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:10.585
Stop!

198
00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.233
Stop it. please!

199
00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.968
You’re hurting me.

200
00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:23.639
Please. stop!

201
00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.643
I beg you. stop.

202
00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.647
Please...

203
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.628
Here. dress up.

204
00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.597
It dawned on me.

205
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.767
Debbie had found a
distant relative of mine.

206
00:21:09.147 --> 00:21:10.812
My niece.

207
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.355
Jenny.

208
00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:14.399
What the...

209
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.401
Debbie. what’s this?

210
00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.070
Didn’t you enjoy it?

211
00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.322
This is foul.

212
00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:22.348
Whatever.

213
00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:40.383
Jenny.

214
00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:43.136
Sorry.

215
00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:45.059
I didn’t know.

216
00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:49.309
I didn’t know too. Uncle.

217
00:21:50.473 --> 00:21:54.435
I needed money for school.

218
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.316
Please.

219
00:21:56.758 --> 00:21:58.593
Cut the drama.

220
00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.237
It’s just a game.

221
00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:04.324
Besides. you never see each other.

222
00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:06.959
You’re hardly family.

223
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:16.878
You’re disgusting.

224
00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:27.304
Take this.

225
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.974
Dress up and go.

226
00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:31.893
Sorry. Uncle.

227
00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:33.728
Get dressed.

228
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:45.114
What did I tell you?

229
00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:47.325
It's all about money.

230
00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:49.952
Everyone has a price.

231
00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:07.340
Screw you!

232
00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:41.865
Look at these ordinary people.

233
00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:44.924
They act nice.

234
00:23:46.556 --> 00:23:48.516
They look so innocent.

235
00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:52.201
But they’re all the same.

236
00:23:52.817 --> 00:23:57.280
Offer them a new cellphone.
and they’re yours.

237
00:24:01.305 --> 00:24:05.559
Their souls are more rotten than ours.

238
00:24:07.225 --> 00:24:10.937
That was the first time
I thought of breaking up with Debbie.

239
00:24:13.453 --> 00:24:15.413
What stopped you?

240
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.123
I don’t know.

241
00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:21.119
Maybe it’s because
I’m just as bad as her.

242
00:24:22.751 --> 00:24:28.673
And finding another match
like that won’t be easy.

243
00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:32.909
We know each other inside and out.

244
00:24:34.882 --> 00:24:36.342
You think you’re the same.

245
00:24:37.034 --> 00:24:38.660
Yes.

246
00:24:39.697 --> 00:24:44.670
Like her. I ruined a lot of lives
to get to where I am.

247
00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:49.634
And I enjoyed the things
we did together.

248
00:24:51.998 --> 00:24:53.295
Do you love her?

249
00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:59.040
I loved her then.

250
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:05.421
Now...

251
00:25:07.577 --> 00:25:08.748
I’m not sure.

252
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.173
We’ve run out of cash. ma’am.
I’m so sorry.

253
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.450
It’s okay. how much do you need?

254
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.056
She used to run
the office cafeteria.

255
00:25:55.081 --> 00:25:56.639
She’s borrowing money again.

256
00:25:56.664 --> 00:25:59.094
she can’t even pay
the interest on the last one.

257
00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:01.607
Did you just come
from your psychiatrist?

258
00:26:04.622 --> 00:26:07.833
I don’t see why you
need to see Susan.

259
00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:10.290
I’m here. Talk to me.

260
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:13.614
I have an idea.

261
00:26:14.325 --> 00:26:19.330
That girl just now. the caterer’s daughter.
her name’s Sheila.

262
00:26:19.502 --> 00:26:21.084
So conservative.

263
00:26:21.414 --> 00:26:23.607
She even wanted to be a nun.

264
00:26:23.632 --> 00:26:27.052
Now she has a boyfriend.
He wanted to be a priest.

265
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.257
A union from a seminary and a convent.

266
00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:34.302
I’m sure they’re virgins.

267
00:26:35.124 --> 00:26:36.443
Let’s make a bet.

268
00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:41.434
Whoever gets one
of them first. wins.

269
00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:44.770
You get the girl. I get the boy.

270
00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:48.608
Too easy. Just buy them off.

271
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.611
No. money won’t work on those two.

272
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:53.812
The mother. sure.

273
00:26:53.837 --> 00:26:55.255
But the daughter?

274
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.659
Come on. this will be fun.

275
00:26:58.841 --> 00:27:02.928
Let’s make it a slow burn.
make it more challenging.

276
00:27:03.711 --> 00:27:07.131
Like we’re making our own movie.

277
00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:19.428
First. some house rules.

278
00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:22.350
Force can’t be used.

279
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:25.202
Kidnapping and rape are out.

280
00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:28.068
Same goes for drugs.

281
00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:30.316
They must give in
out of their own volition.

282
00:27:31.522 --> 00:27:32.927
What are the stakes?

283
00:27:33.463 --> 00:27:35.298
Your condo.

284
00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:36.748
And you?

285
00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:39.924
I will be your sex slave for a month.

286
00:27:40.534 --> 00:27:42.639
Aren’t you already?

287
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.692
Come on. game?

288
00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:47.834
May the best man-

289
00:27:47.896 --> 00:27:48.851
No.

290
00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:50.365
person win.

291
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.629
Miss!

292
00:28:07.798 --> 00:28:10.092
Miss. wait!
You dropped this handkerchief.

293
00:28:10.462 --> 00:28:12.047
That’s not mine.

294
00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:13.958
Miss. wait.

295
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:18.406
I know we just met.
But I have an offer for you.

296
00:28:22.243 --> 00:28:24.161
100 thousand pesos.

297
00:28:25.899 --> 00:28:26.941
For one night.

298
00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.628
I’ll sweeten the deal.

299
00:28:34.428 --> 00:28:36.203
200 thousand pesos.

300
00:28:38.962 --> 00:28:40.757
300 thousand pesos.

301
00:28:47.989 --> 00:28:50.199
You rushed it.

302
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.835
I told you.
money won’t open their legs.

303
00:28:55.977 --> 00:28:57.854
Have a sense of drama.

304
00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:00.908
Let’s take them for a spin.

305
00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:11.790
There needs to be a story.
Just like the movies.

306
00:29:17.843 --> 00:29:19.507
Where’s my trophy for Best Actress?

307
00:29:19.532 --> 00:29:22.775
I’m heavier than the guy
so I almost fell.

308
00:29:22.814 --> 00:29:24.632
Ma’am. are you okay?

309
00:29:24.754 --> 00:29:26.631
I feel dizzy.

310
00:29:28.116 --> 00:29:31.208
Can you walk me
to my car. please?

311
00:29:31.233 --> 00:29:33.680
- Sure.
- Okay. thank you.

312
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.256
Don’t you have a driver?

313
00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:49.621
You shouldn't drive in this state.

314
00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:55.960
Can you stay with me just until
the dizziness goes away? Please?

315
00:30:04.445 --> 00:30:05.724
Thank you.

316
00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:07.180
You’re welcome.

317
00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.559
I often go to church there.

318
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.563
I always see you.

319
00:30:16.535 --> 00:30:18.693
You always sit up front.

320
00:30:19.345 --> 00:30:21.138
It’s my favorite spot.

321
00:30:21.242 --> 00:30:23.078
I feel closer to God.

322
00:30:23.266 --> 00:30:29.105
No matter how often I hear mass
or how much I try to get close to him.

323
00:30:29.936 --> 00:30:32.564
I feel he’s still so far away.

324
00:30:32.944 --> 00:30:33.944
What?

325
00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:35.592
Why?

326
00:30:36.542 --> 00:30:37.967
Years ago.

327
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.084
my family suffered a terrible tragedy.

328
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.218
I’d rather not talk about it.

329
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.413
That’s when I lost my faith in God.

330
00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:52.141
But I kept going to church.

331
00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:56.452
I thought. maybe
if I heard enough masses.

332
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.398
my faith would be restored.

333
00:30:59.681 --> 00:31:00.889
But...

334
00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:04.514
God wasn’t listening. it seems.

335
00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:07.490
He is always listening.

336
00:31:08.202 --> 00:31:09.620
Not to me.

337
00:31:10.247 --> 00:31:12.166
He loves everyone.

338
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.309
Except me.

339
00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:17.975
He doesn’t see me.

340
00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:20.813
He sees everything.

341
00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:23.530
Including this?

342
00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:32.708
Everything that lives
on this earth. big or small.

343
00:31:32.733 --> 00:31:34.985
God sees it.

344
00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:41.833
How about this?

345
00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:43.510
Is this big enough?

346
00:31:57.068 --> 00:32:00.217
He didn’t find heaven
between your thighs.

347
00:32:00.242 --> 00:32:01.576
but hell!

348
00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:03.436
Look who's talking!

349
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:06.178
Didn't you fail. too?

350
00:32:07.276 --> 00:32:09.987
Let’s look for someone else.

351
00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:12.739
We’re wasting our time
with those prudes.

352
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:15.425
No. I’m not giving up.

353
00:32:16.684 --> 00:32:18.853
What for? We’re wasting our time.

354
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.315
I won't let Alvin
get away with it.

355
00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:26.620
I’m getting even.
I’ll use a different approach.

356
00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:28.891
Are you really giving up?

357
00:32:29.507 --> 00:32:32.343
I didn’t sign up for a talk show.

358
00:32:32.368 --> 00:32:34.162
Pay me.
and I’m outta here.

359
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.765
Let’s do it.

360
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.863
All right!

361
00:32:39.888 --> 00:32:42.015
I’ll be on top. you at the bottom.

362
00:33:33.347 --> 00:33:34.347
Alvin!

363
00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.125
Wait!

364
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.599
Alvin. wait!

365
00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:40.218
I want to apologize.

366
00:33:45.489 --> 00:33:47.533
- Welcome. come in.
- Good afternoon. ma’am.

367
00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:04.335
White is my favorite color.

368
00:34:04.846 --> 00:34:07.223
I feel like an angel.

369
00:34:08.305 --> 00:34:10.599
I’m glad I didn’t scare you off.

370
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:14.874
I trust you won’t do
what you did before.

371
00:34:15.212 --> 00:34:17.130
Like I said.

372
00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.115
God sees everything.

373
00:34:19.366 --> 00:34:22.869
His will and His alone be done.

374
00:34:23.724 --> 00:34:25.726
I promise to behave.

375
00:34:25.888 --> 00:34:27.181
I feel embarrassed.

376
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.227
To think I know your girlfriend’s mother.

377
00:34:30.252 --> 00:34:31.586
Ma’am Edna?

378
00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:32.899
Yes.

379
00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:36.421
What a coincidence. right?

380
00:34:36.685 --> 00:34:41.399
It’s true. what they say.
God moves in mysterious ways.

381
00:34:42.053 --> 00:34:45.264
I heard you were in the seminary.

382
00:34:45.536 --> 00:34:49.406
What stopped you from becoming a priest?

383
00:34:49.743 --> 00:34:53.830
I realized that my mission
was outside the seminary.

384
00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:10.691
I acted in movies before.

385
00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:15.196
You were okay with that?

386
00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:17.406
Wasn’t it too daring?

387
00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:23.622
A bold star won't see the difference.

388
00:35:28.787 --> 00:35:29.788
Wine?

389
00:35:30.472 --> 00:35:31.556
Water?

390
00:35:31.998 --> 00:35:32.998
Juice?

391
00:35:33.023 --> 00:35:34.023
No.

392
00:35:35.093 --> 00:35:36.428
Thank you.

393
00:35:39.435 --> 00:35:41.729
My mother was a house maid.

394
00:35:42.394 --> 00:35:46.481
Whenever I think of her. I see her...

395
00:35:47.618 --> 00:35:52.331
cleaning each step
of a mansion’s winding staircase.

396
00:35:53.663 --> 00:35:58.793
She would scrub hard

397
00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:05.074
because if she didn’t.
the lady of the house would curse at her.

398
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.583
I pitied her.

399
00:36:12.093 --> 00:36:14.429
I swore that one day-

400
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:21.243
I would own a house
with a staircase just as grand.

401
00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:27.369
I would stand at the top of the stairs.
a glass of wine in my hand.

402
00:36:27.658 --> 00:36:30.536
The way of the rich. right?

403
00:36:33.805 --> 00:36:37.559
So when I was still an actress.

404
00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:43.159
I married my producer
as soon as he proposed.

405
00:36:43.826 --> 00:36:47.288
even if I didn’t love him.

406
00:36:47.955 --> 00:36:51.167
He was old

407
00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:54.403
and sickly.

408
00:36:55.227 --> 00:36:58.731
He died not long after that.

409
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:00.801
Suddenly I was rich.

410
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:04.263
And here we are. in my dream mansion.

411
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.227
Bobby is my second husband.

412
00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:16.400
We were happy at first.
But it didn’t last.

413
00:37:16.692 --> 00:37:22.031
We live in the same house.
but live different lives.

414
00:37:23.047 --> 00:37:26.842
This house is empty
most of the time.

415
00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:30.192
I feel empty most of the time.

416
00:37:31.185 --> 00:37:34.188
I got the staircase
I always dreamed of.

417
00:37:34.274 --> 00:37:39.113
so how come I feel
like I have nowhere to go?

418
00:37:41.193 --> 00:37:44.488
Help me get on the right path.

419
00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:46.599
I’ll do my best.

420
00:37:48.103 --> 00:37:49.103
Thank you.

421
00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:50.337
You’re welcome.

422
00:38:23.637 --> 00:38:25.514
Losing your house to a fire is painful

423
00:38:25.539 --> 00:38:28.125
not because of the things you lose.

424
00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:31.451
but because of the memories
attached to those things.

425
00:38:31.598 --> 00:38:37.729
Photographs. letters.
the furniture that you worked so hard for.

426
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.695
I’m sorry for what I did last time.

427
00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:45.781
What made you do it anyway?

428
00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:49.410
I often see you helping out people in need.

429
00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:52.788
I’d watch you.

430
00:38:53.507 --> 00:38:55.467
I know your wife.

431
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.127
And I have a boyfriend.

432
00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:01.797
Again. I’m sorry.

433
00:39:02.934 --> 00:39:05.019
Can we still be friends?

434
00:39:07.198 --> 00:39:09.408
I want to donate a small amount.

435
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.295
For them.

436
00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:12.882
Thanks.

437
00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.685
That would be a big help.

438
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:17.730
I admire you.

439
00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:21.567
I know that you and your mother
don’t have it easy.

440
00:39:22.137 --> 00:39:24.056
and yet here you are helping others.

441
00:39:25.286 --> 00:39:27.830
I was set on becoming a nun.

442
00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:32.194
I had to drop out so I could
help support my family.

443
00:39:32.729 --> 00:39:37.025
My parents died
when I was just a kid.

444
00:39:37.568 --> 00:39:38.653
Plane crash.

445
00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:41.587
So I never knew what it was like
to have a family.

446
00:39:42.404 --> 00:39:44.322
Your wife. Mrs. Blanco?

447
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.928
I don’t love her anymore.

448
00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:51.932
And vice versa.

449
00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.348
We go on acting like we do.

450
00:39:58.066 --> 00:39:59.484
It’s all pretending.

451
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.686
Did you have to hold his hand?

452
00:40:19.827 --> 00:40:21.644
He might fall in love with you.

453
00:40:21.762 --> 00:40:23.388
So be it.

454
00:40:23.453 --> 00:40:25.975
Let them learn that
not everyone can be bought.

455
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.820
Or toyed with.

456
00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:41.605
Mara?

457
00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:45.187
I have to tell you something.

458
00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:55.511
Mara hates Mrs. Blanco.

459
00:40:55.621 --> 00:40:58.499
So she's really set
on helping us out.

460
00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.166
That Mrs. Blanco is a bad person.

461
00:41:01.834 --> 00:41:05.821
To her everything is pretense.

462
00:41:06.509 --> 00:41:11.681
My mother told me about the time
Mrs. Blanco fired an employee.

463
00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:13.750
She made up a story.

464
00:41:14.322 --> 00:41:17.742
Paid someone to set up
the poor employee.

465
00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:20.370
So firing him would be easy.

466
00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:27.918
She lends us money but buries
mother in the interest payments alone.

467
00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:30.273
And not without a few harsh words.

468
00:41:30.298 --> 00:41:32.050
What about the husband?

469
00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.099
They’re the same.

470
00:41:36.148 --> 00:41:39.818
Mr. Blanco is in the business
of finding small companies

471
00:41:40.135 --> 00:41:42.680
and making sure they go bankrupt

472
00:41:42.705 --> 00:41:45.083
so he can buy them out cheap.

473
00:41:46.169 --> 00:41:48.477
For him it’s all about money.

474
00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:52.736
Are we on the right path. though?

475
00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:55.449
Isn't what we're doing a sin?

476
00:41:55.723 --> 00:41:57.599
Let’s just avoid them.

477
00:41:58.167 --> 00:41:59.877
Be patient.

478
00:41:59.935 --> 00:42:01.895
Let’s toy with them too.

479
00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:04.354
For Mother.

480
00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:09.319
Let’s give them a dose
of their own medicine.

481
00:42:10.344 --> 00:42:12.138
I’m just worried.

482
00:42:12.169 --> 00:42:14.171
What if Mr. Blanco rapes you?

483
00:42:15.185 --> 00:42:16.939
I can take care of myself.

484
00:42:17.223 --> 00:42:21.894
Worry about yourself
resisting Mrs. Blanco’s fair skin.

485
00:42:22.247 --> 00:42:24.083
I’m yours. no one else’s.

486
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:31.799
One more. please.

487
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.277
One kiss a day. remember?

488
00:42:35.388 --> 00:42:37.307
Let’s not court temptation. Alvin.

489
00:42:38.514 --> 00:42:43.017
We made a vow.
No sex before marriage.

490
00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:46.414
Just a peek then.

491
00:42:46.555 --> 00:42:48.557
Stop it. Alvin Sarmiento!

492
00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:51.523
Come on. just a tiny bit.

493
00:42:52.654 --> 00:42:56.533
Didn’t Mrs. Blanco show you hers?

494
00:42:57.564 --> 00:43:00.358
Yours is different. Come on.

495
00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:09.544
Just a peek.

496
00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:12.338
Let me see.

497
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.166
What’s with the bra?
Come on. let me see.

498
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:21.193
You always have to haggle.

499
00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:27.203
Take a cold shower.

500
00:43:27.228 --> 00:43:28.980
That would make me even hotter.

501
00:43:30.305 --> 00:43:31.973
You’re too horny.

502
00:43:32.098 --> 00:43:34.225
Imagine if you became a priest!

503
00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:36.436
Eat more papaya.

504
00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:38.589
I’ve bought all the papayas in the market.

505
00:43:40.306 --> 00:43:42.016
Hang in there.

506
00:43:42.177 --> 00:43:43.303
I love you.

507
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.437
I love you.

508
00:43:44.462 --> 00:43:47.048
Now. let me see your breasts.

509
00:44:00.605 --> 00:44:03.191
And the other one. too.

510
00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:08.937
So beautiful.

511
00:44:14.288 --> 00:44:15.498
Let me kiss you.

512
00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:17.148
On the neck.

513
00:44:17.341 --> 00:44:19.552
Fine. just not on the lips.

514
00:44:29.687 --> 00:44:31.313
Hey! Stop!

515
00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:33.771
I’ll get mad.

516
00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:36.099
Let’s just eat.

517
00:44:39.966 --> 00:44:42.093
Wait for me. I’ll just take a shower.

518
00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:50.270
They’re making it hard for us.

519
00:44:53.906 --> 00:44:55.908
They’ll fall. you’ll see.

520
00:44:57.236 --> 00:44:59.279
You can’t quit now.

521
00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:01.614
Who says I’m quitting?

522
00:45:02.459 --> 00:45:06.504
Especially now.
Sheila’s mother is in the hospital.

523
00:45:07.883 --> 00:45:09.343
It’s time to go for the kill.

524
00:45:14.127 --> 00:45:15.127
Mom!

525
00:45:15.152 --> 00:45:16.188
Mom!

526
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.940
What happened to my mom. Doc?

527
00:45:17.965 --> 00:45:20.008
Miss. please wait outside.
you’re not allowed here.

528
00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:21.283
Mom.

529
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.529
How is she?

530
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.439
Stable.

531
00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:40.283
Just this morning she was busy working.

532
00:45:40.445 --> 00:45:42.197
All of a sudden she fell.

533
00:45:42.697 --> 00:45:44.067
What did the doctor say?

534
00:45:44.092 --> 00:45:45.760
They’re still observing her.

535
00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:48.495
We’re drowning in debt.

536
00:45:49.274 --> 00:45:51.193
My savings are gone.

537
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.008
I have some left.
It will help.

538
00:45:55.033 --> 00:45:56.617
You don’t have to.

539
00:45:57.212 --> 00:45:59.298
What’s mine is yours.

540
00:46:00.611 --> 00:46:02.863
Dad hasn’t been answering
my calls.

541
00:46:03.186 --> 00:46:04.896
I’m sure he’s gambling again.

542
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.197
I can spot you some cash.

543
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.705
I know you.

544
00:46:33.956 --> 00:46:36.042
You act all nice

545
00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:38.462
but you’ll bleed me dry.

546
00:46:39.504 --> 00:46:41.381
I won big.

547
00:46:42.424 --> 00:46:48.127
I believe if you pay it forward.
you’ll win bigger.

548
00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:50.390
That’s not true for gambling.

549
00:46:51.266 --> 00:46:52.266
You’re right.

550
00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:55.687
So. how much?

551
00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:06.306
I’m out.

552
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.327
Quitters never win.

553
00:47:11.637 --> 00:47:12.805
Quitters-

554
00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.624
Lose?

555
00:47:23.048 --> 00:47:24.466
So. how much?

556
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:43.443
I thank God everyday for my daughter.
who is so good.

557
00:47:45.548 --> 00:47:54.932
She has dedicated herself
to making life easier for us. her family.

558
00:47:56.498 --> 00:48:01.003
She started working very young.

559
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.091
Me...

560
00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.762
I’m a worthless mother.

561
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:15.434
Thank you.

562
00:48:17.185 --> 00:48:19.688
Thank you for loving her.

563
00:48:19.855 --> 00:48:21.690
I love her more than my life.

564
00:48:25.986 --> 00:48:26.986
No...

565
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.033
That’s not right.

566
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.368
Love her.

567
00:48:34.831 --> 00:48:36.332
Just love her enough.

568
00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:48.258
More than that.
and you end up like me.

569
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.880
That’s your final salary.

570
00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:01.539
Sir? Why?

571
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.774
Did I do something wrong?

572
00:49:04.886 --> 00:49:06.096
No. Sheila.

573
00:49:06.526 --> 00:49:08.737
The company is losing money.

574
00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.698
Sorry I didn’t inform you sooner.

575
00:49:13.111 --> 00:49:16.197
I added a little extra
to your separation pay.

576
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.597
My mother’s in the hospital.

577
00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:22.793
I need this job.

578
00:49:24.558 --> 00:49:26.463
I’m really sorry.

579
00:49:32.453 --> 00:49:33.912
Give me your ID.

580
00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:48.360
Now. everyone- You. put that there.

581
00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:51.238
And you. make sure nothing’s lost.

582
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:08.894
What?

583
00:50:09.312 --> 00:50:10.522
It’s done.

584
00:50:12.871 --> 00:50:14.164
I owe you. bro.

585
00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.460
You’re welcome.

586
00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:26.415
You think Mr. Blanco
has something to do with it?

587
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.160
I don’t think so.

588
00:50:29.484 --> 00:50:32.404
The company is really in a bind.

589
00:50:33.266 --> 00:50:35.018
Why were you the only one let go?

590
00:50:36.193 --> 00:50:40.030
Maybe you could ask their housemaid
if she heard something.

591
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.334
I have to find a job soon.

592
00:50:48.018 --> 00:50:51.646
The hospital bill keeps growing.

593
00:50:54.143 --> 00:50:57.772
Meanwhile. my father’s still in the casino.

594
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:01.349
What if I borrow money
from Mrs. Blanco?

595
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.621
I’m sure she’ll shell out.

596
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:03.726
Don’t!

597
00:51:04.815 --> 00:51:06.317
Don’t ever do that!

598
00:51:07.526 --> 00:51:09.153
We’ll manage.

599
00:51:30.795 --> 00:51:31.974
Don’t. Alvin!

600
00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.810
Sorry. Sheila. I can’t hold it anymore.

601
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:34.372
The last time I had this
I was nine years old.

602
00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:36.583
It was my birthday.

603
00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:41.296
My mother knew this was my favorite.

604
00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:48.845
She kept saying how much she loved me.

605
00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:57.437
And then we went to the loan shark.

606
00:55:59.372 --> 00:56:03.526
He fed us so much food I felt I’d burst.

607
00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:16.289
And then she left me in his bedroom.

608
00:56:18.249 --> 00:56:20.126
He raped me.

609
00:56:24.923 --> 00:56:25.965
So you know-

610
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:32.305
I lost all faith in motherly love.

611
00:56:43.766 --> 00:56:45.084
What happened?

612
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:48.521
Something’s wrong with her heart!

613
00:56:48.546 --> 00:56:51.122
They need to operate on her right away.

614
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.036
I don’t know where to get the money.

615
00:56:59.832 --> 00:57:01.226
Don’t worry.

616
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.896
We’ll find a way to manage.

617
00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:04.913
Sorry. Alvin.

618
00:57:05.595 --> 00:57:08.097
You know our policy about cash advances.

619
00:57:09.584 --> 00:57:11.294
It’s an emergency. sir.

620
00:57:11.713 --> 00:57:13.548
I’ll take on more work.

621
00:57:14.474 --> 00:57:16.810
I can’t help you. Alvin.

622
00:57:20.376 --> 00:57:21.805
How many have you done. Maritess?

623
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:22.914
Ten. sir.

624
00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.904
Too slow. keep going.

625
00:57:47.755 --> 00:57:48.755
Hello?

626
00:57:49.222 --> 00:57:50.390
Hello. Alvin?

627
00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:52.218
Hello?

628
00:58:02.334 --> 00:58:04.754
I bet it’s money.

629
00:58:05.256 --> 00:58:06.508
He’ll call again.

630
00:58:07.175 --> 00:58:08.718
I can almost taste him.

631
00:58:09.177 --> 00:58:10.386
You should thank me.

632
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.224
I applied the necessary pressure on Sheila.
that’s why Alvin is calling you.

633
00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:17.227
First one wins.

634
00:58:17.852 --> 00:58:19.854
I have the edge.

635
00:58:21.245 --> 00:58:24.540
Her mom is still critical.

636
00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:27.387
The dad’s a goner in the casino.

637
00:58:28.239 --> 00:58:29.949
She’ll come to me.

638
00:58:42.335 --> 00:58:44.087
Let’s stop this. Alvin.

639
00:58:44.383 --> 00:58:46.260
Maybe it’s bad karma.

640
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:50.521
We don’t need them.

641
00:58:51.998 --> 00:58:53.917
We’ll find a way.

642
00:58:56.557 --> 00:58:57.891
God listens.

643
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.978
These two horndogs...

644
01:00:24.003 --> 01:00:27.715
It’s too early! All you wanna do
is screw each other.

645
01:00:27.982 --> 01:00:30.335
Hey. buy me some mangoes later.

646
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.154
Hey. you still owe me.
you better pay that first.

647
01:00:34.945 --> 01:00:36.730
Jenny. your ass is delicious.

648
01:00:36.755 --> 01:00:41.117
Pig! Pay up
and you’ll get a taste of this ass.

649
01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:45.441
Hey.

650
01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:47.508
Your pie hole’s huge!

651
01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:51.076
So big. It can fit eight dicks.

652
01:00:51.101 --> 01:00:55.351
Wow! As if you don’t suck on one. bitch

653
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:58.513
Hey. what’s up?

654
01:01:09.849 --> 01:01:12.184
This again?

655
01:01:12.209 --> 01:01:15.633
This was yesterday’s meal. spaghetti.

656
01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:20.493
I’ll take this. sinigang.

657
01:01:20.518 --> 01:01:23.313
You better add more soup.

658
01:01:24.538 --> 01:01:25.844
Menudo?

659
01:01:26.303 --> 01:01:27.303
How about this one?

660
01:01:28.253 --> 01:01:29.253
Jenny?

661
01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.532
How are you?

662
01:01:42.183 --> 01:01:43.893
You saw it yourself.

663
01:01:44.149 --> 01:01:45.719
That’s my job now.

664
01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:55.269
On good nights. I get three customers.

665
01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:59.340
On bad ones. zero.

666
01:02:02.642 --> 01:02:06.972
Sometimes the man stinks.

667
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:10.585
I’m lucky if I get someone
that doesn’t smell.

668
01:02:13.392 --> 01:02:22.085
Sometimes I just want to work
my ass off to make more money.

669
01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.645
Sometimes...

670
01:02:34.275 --> 01:02:36.360
I just want to die.

671
01:02:40.145 --> 01:02:41.772
I don’t get it.

672
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.205
How could you let this happen?

673
01:02:49.373 --> 01:02:50.750
You son of a bitch.

674
01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.294
You really don’t know?

675
01:02:55.749 --> 01:02:56.750
Wait.

676
01:03:12.063 --> 01:03:13.356
Not enough.

677
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:30.599
How is she?

678
01:04:40.364 --> 01:04:42.491
Sorry. I couldn’t come sooner.

679
01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:03.859
I know my shortcomings.

680
01:05:06.538 --> 01:05:11.710
I’m no help.

681
01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:16.269
And now I’m deep in debt
to Mr. Blanco.

682
01:05:18.356 --> 01:05:19.482
The casino.

683
01:05:21.882 --> 01:05:26.530
He kept egging me on.
My losses piled up.

684
01:06:06.287 --> 01:06:07.312
Sir?

685
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.038
Thank you.

686
01:06:41.966 --> 01:06:43.004
So?

687
01:06:45.507 --> 01:06:46.875
You need something?

688
01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.406
I accept your offer.

689
01:06:50.902 --> 01:06:53.182
The money you… offered.

690
01:10:19.724 --> 01:10:22.514
- Leave.
- Thank you.

691
01:10:24.239 --> 01:10:26.574
Thank you.

692
01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:29.818
Go.

693
01:10:40.946 --> 01:10:42.846
Was that a first for you?

694
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.562
I surprised even myself.

695
01:10:53.935 --> 01:10:55.861
It’s like I don’t know who I am anymore.

696
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.781
You’re growing a conscience.

697
01:11:01.427 --> 01:11:04.242
Harsh. I already have one. don’t I?

698
01:11:05.532 --> 01:11:08.990
As far as I know. none.

699
01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.944
Forgive me. Alvin.

700
01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.865
I didn’t know where to turn.

701
01:11:44.611 --> 01:11:48.203
I’ve wronged you.

702
01:11:51.468 --> 01:11:54.000
He didn’t go through with it.

703
01:11:54.754 --> 01:11:58.639
He gave me the money
without having sex with me.

704
01:11:58.991 --> 01:12:01.661
Forgive me. Alvin.

705
01:12:02.074 --> 01:12:05.137
Forgive me. Alvin.

706
01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:09.616
- Please forgive me.
- Don't cry anymore.

707
01:12:10.233 --> 01:12:13.111
It’s going to be okay.

708
01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:21.695
Don’t move.

709
01:12:23.045 --> 01:12:24.264
That’s it!

710
01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:29.256
That is exactly how I first saw you
when we met at your husband’s wake.

711
01:12:32.036 --> 01:12:35.459
Everyone there was fake.

712
01:12:37.009 --> 01:12:39.095
They kept singing praises
to my dead husband.

713
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.673
I was bored out of my wits.

714
01:12:53.686 --> 01:12:56.105
My condolences.

715
01:13:02.793 --> 01:13:05.213
It was love at first sight. you and me.

716
01:13:05.238 --> 01:13:08.312
More like sex at first sight.

717
01:13:20.323 --> 01:13:23.410
A younger man feels so good.

718
01:14:05.549 --> 01:14:08.802
So good! Deeper!

719
01:14:12.086 --> 01:14:15.465
The best sex I’ve ever had.

720
01:14:15.832 --> 01:14:19.271
If your husband
heard the sounds you made.

721
01:14:20.587 --> 01:14:22.596
he would have risen from the dead.

722
01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:25.677
Those were the days.

723
01:14:25.702 --> 01:14:27.753
We were insatiable.

724
01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.883
We’d do it four times a day.

725
01:14:30.908 --> 01:14:33.244
On any surface. Flat or not.

726
01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:36.272
Actually. even on not-so-flat surfaces

727
01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.082
Do you still love me?

728
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:58.184
As if I’m interested to know the answer!

729
01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:03.106
Why did you hold
back with Sheila?

730
01:15:04.219 --> 01:15:06.151
Are you trying to lose?

731
01:15:08.418 --> 01:15:11.406
You should be happy then!

732
01:15:13.635 --> 01:15:17.162
That’s not how I want to win.

733
01:15:18.658 --> 01:15:21.082
Why did you give her the slip?

734
01:15:22.808 --> 01:15:25.253
Are you falling for her?

735
01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.716
I took pity on her.
I’m still capable of pity.

736
01:16:03.111 --> 01:16:05.835
You used to love it when I did that.

737
01:16:09.088 --> 01:16:10.757
Not anymore?

738
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.427
No game.

739
01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.682
Not without a game.

740
01:16:51.916 --> 01:16:53.341
Sorry. Debbie.

741
01:16:53.763 --> 01:16:56.386
I cannot divulge patient information.

742
01:16:56.512 --> 01:17:02.642
Just tell me if he has feelings
for that girl.

743
01:17:07.741 --> 01:17:11.443
We have this game.
I’m sure you know.

744
01:17:11.845 --> 01:17:16.573
I just want to understand
why Bobby’s intentionally losing.

745
01:17:22.088 --> 01:17:23.767
I can’t tell you anything.

746
01:17:23.828 --> 01:17:25.248
Sorry. Debbie.

747
01:17:28.488 --> 01:17:33.798
What if I hire you as my therapist?
Will you talk then?

748
01:17:35.578 --> 01:17:37.719
I’ll double the pay.

749
01:17:43.219 --> 01:17:46.019
I can be a good friend. Susan.

750
01:17:47.366 --> 01:17:49.773
I have a feeling we’ll get along.

751
01:17:50.872 --> 01:17:52.090
I like you.

752
01:17:55.844 --> 01:17:57.906
Let me tell you this. Debbie-

753
01:17:58.581 --> 01:18:03.536
You haven’t made a movie in years
and yet you continue to act.

754
01:18:06.852 --> 01:18:12.108
When I get into character.
I escape reality.

755
01:18:14.184 --> 01:18:15.799
Help me.

756
01:18:19.933 --> 01:18:22.263
Debbie. why don’t
you just talk to Bobby?

757
01:18:23.702 --> 01:18:30.378
Whatever I say. I know you’ll listen
to only what you want to hear.

758
01:18:35.959 --> 01:18:37.529
You know what. Susan.

759
01:18:38.446 --> 01:18:39.815
screw you!

760
01:18:47.934 --> 01:18:50.562
Damn this!

761
01:18:53.992 --> 01:18:56.912
Damn this life!

762
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:08.108
I don’t want this!

763
01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:12.272
I don’t want this anymore…

764
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:18.635
Sir.

765
01:19:29.997 --> 01:19:32.459
I know what happened
between you and Shiela.

766
01:19:33.172 --> 01:19:34.878
I want to thank you.

767
01:19:35.655 --> 01:19:39.340
For respecting my girlfriend.
For respecting me.

768
01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:41.370
It’s nothing.

769
01:19:41.995 --> 01:19:43.795
What I did was only right.

770
01:19:49.016 --> 01:19:50.322
I know everything.

771
01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:58.318
The sex games you and your wife play…
Sheila and I know about it.

772
01:20:00.753 --> 01:20:05.491
You rich people think
you got it all figured out.

773
01:20:07.454 --> 01:20:12.040
You act as if you’re God’s only children.

774
01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:18.487
You forgot about us.

775
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.970
You forgot that the game
could be played both ways.

776
01:20:27.623 --> 01:20:29.891
That makes us equal.

777
01:21:10.612 --> 01:21:14.824
All of us were just acting.
Imagine that.

778
01:21:19.615 --> 01:21:22.568
That boy made a fool of me.

779
01:21:29.548 --> 01:21:31.452
I want to break up with you.

780
01:21:35.845 --> 01:21:38.167
I’ve been thinking about it
for some time.

781
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.299
I made my decision just now.

782
01:21:54.329 --> 01:22:03.067
Maybe you do have feelings
for that fake-saint-true-slut Sheila.

783
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:10.533
I’ll have our lawyers sort it out.

784
01:22:13.415 --> 01:22:20.251
Don’t worry. I’ll be fair with
the division of properties.

785
01:22:21.498 --> 01:22:23.087
Whatever.

786
01:23:24.997 --> 01:23:27.500
Make sure you won't get caught.

787
01:23:27.525 --> 01:23:28.943
Sure.

788
01:23:51.207 --> 01:23:52.718
Hello. Alvin?

789
01:23:53.602 --> 01:23:55.430
I found a job.

790
01:23:56.373 --> 01:24:01.102
Yeah. I got it.
I start tomorrow.

791
01:24:13.012 --> 01:24:14.138
No sudden movements.

792
01:24:14.163 --> 01:24:15.790
Just keep walking.

793
01:24:26.054 --> 01:24:27.128
Debbie.

794
01:24:28.256 --> 01:24:30.854
I have a surprise for you.

795
01:24:31.718 --> 01:24:34.385
Meet me at the old stock room.

796
01:24:36.496 --> 01:24:37.619
Okay.

797
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.031
See you!

798
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:00.074
Hello?

799
01:25:00.099 --> 01:25:03.620
Hello? Sorry to bother you. Mr. Blanco.
Sheila’s missing.

800
01:25:03.645 --> 01:25:09.128
Your wife called me. Told me to call you
if I wanted to see Sheila.

801
01:25:22.696 --> 01:25:24.018
Get in!

802
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:30.345
Let go of me-

803
01:26:04.214 --> 01:26:05.393
Hi Sheila!

804
01:26:05.525 --> 01:26:10.154
You? You whore! You demon!

805
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:11.893
Whatever.

806
01:26:14.516 --> 01:26:15.434
Hey!

807
01:26:15.459 --> 01:26:16.919
Save that for later!

808
01:26:16.944 --> 01:26:21.367
We’re still waiting for our guests.

809
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.229
Here they are.

810
01:26:30.194 --> 01:26:32.128
What took you so long?

811
01:26:32.545 --> 01:26:35.465
We’ve been waiting.

812
01:26:36.835 --> 01:26:38.143
Go ahead.

813
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:40.725
Just try!

814
01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:42.972
You whore!

815
01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:45.557
Your girlfriend agrees with you.

816
01:26:45.816 --> 01:26:48.944
Debbie. what are you doing?

817
01:26:49.014 --> 01:26:53.774
Now that we’re complete.
let’s start the game.

818
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:58.435
Debbie. stop this!

819
01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.989
Why. Bobby?

820
01:27:00.938 --> 01:27:02.533
Tired of playing?

821
01:27:03.292 --> 01:27:06.128
It’s unfair when the game has to stop

822
01:27:06.153 --> 01:27:10.762
just because one of
the players wants out.

823
01:27:11.278 --> 01:27:15.546
The decision has to be mutual.

824
01:27:16.025 --> 01:27:18.736
Like these two.

825
01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:23.822
They’d been playing us
without us knowing.

826
01:27:23.944 --> 01:27:26.405
We had no idea.

827
01:27:31.906 --> 01:27:34.534
So now let’s all play.

828
01:27:38.577 --> 01:27:40.029
Kneel!

829
01:27:42.407 --> 01:27:43.324
Kneel!

830
01:27:43.349 --> 01:27:44.142
Debbie?

831
01:27:44.167 --> 01:27:45.593
Kneel!

832
01:27:58.696 --> 01:28:00.026
Well?

833
01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:03.162
Want to call me a whore again?

834
01:28:03.187 --> 01:28:04.839
You’re a whore!

835
01:28:04.864 --> 01:28:06.408
Thank you.

836
01:28:06.433 --> 01:28:11.187
So? Say... Welcome.

837
01:28:13.869 --> 01:28:15.511
On your knees!

838
01:28:23.648 --> 01:28:30.496
Now let’s watch what happens
with your beloved Sheila.

839
01:28:36.238 --> 01:28:38.824
If you resist. Sheila-

840
01:29:34.413 --> 01:29:37.917
Will you betray me too. Bobby? Huh?

841
01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.372
Damn all of you!

842
01:30:28.845 --> 01:30:30.658
Enough. Debbie.

843
01:30:31.736 --> 01:30:33.222
It’s over.

844
01:34:16.008 --> 01:34:17.964
I love you. Sheila.

845
01:34:17.989 --> 01:34:20.492
I love you. too. Alvin.

846
01:35:19.741 --> 01:35:21.868
You’ll be back.

847
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:26.511
We’re the same. You’ll see.
