5
00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.100
Henry?

6
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.266
Henry!

7
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.266
Hey. Dad. have you seen Henry?

8
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.767
I'm here!

9
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.767
I'm getting the pigweed
out of the ground.

10
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.734
like you said!

11
00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:59.100
You're pulling up
the root. too. right?

12
00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:01.000
Yeah. I'm getting the roots.
What am I. six?

13
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.667
Good! Now go grab me

14
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.600
that big jar of pennies
from the kitchen. okay?

15
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.533
And wipe your muddy feet!

16
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.166
He wiped his feet!

17
00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.100
Okay. I want you
to take these pennies

18
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.166
and line them up...
just like this.

19
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.567
- All right?
- 'Kay.

20
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.633
We need to go all the way around
the broccoli.

21
00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.500
the onions. the cabbages.
and the tomatoes. okay?

22
00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:40.767
The whole thing?

23
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.333
"The whole thing."

24
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:44.800
You wanna know a secret?

25
00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:46.967
These are not vegetables...

26
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.734
they're space pods.

27
00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:49.667
- What?
- Oh. yeah.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.734
Please.

29
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:52.567
The tiny astronauts

30
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.000
that colonized this area.

31
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.133
they built them.

32
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.500
But now...

33
00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:01.166
their colony is under attack by
these hideous space monsters--

34
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.400
Ugh.

35
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.400
- Ew.
- So...

36
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.633
the only way for you
to save the day

37
00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:11.166
is to take these...
microelectron converters

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.667
and form a force-field
all the way around the colony.

39
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.734
Give me a break.

40
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.567
Actually. if you want
to know the truth.

41
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.800
the chemicals in slugs
react to the copper in pennies.

42
00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:25.000
and it keeps them away.

43
00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:27.300
Do I look like a child to you?

44
00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:29.400
Well. I guess not.

45
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:37.500
Hey.

46
00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.066
Dinner's
in the pressure cooker.

47
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.133
20 minutes. all right?

48
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.567
Okay.

49
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.166
He's done
with the Space Invaders.

50
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.166
and went on
to the pterodactyls.

51
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.233
Pterodactyls?

52
00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.333
Chicken coop.

53
00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:51.633
Oh. Right.

54
00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:54.800
I don't remember you being
this quick to grow up.

55
00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:56.834
Sign of the times.

56
00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:58.834
What's this?
You need some help?

57
00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:00.300
Fresh Rite order.

58
00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:01.367
Nope. I'm done.

59
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.767
All right.
I'm gonna wash up.

60
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.667
Sounds good.

61
00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.567
No need to shove. ladies.

62
00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:26.867
Whoa!

63
00:03:30.734 --> 00:03:32.100
Please...

64
00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:35.200
I'm unarmed.

65
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:36.367
Are you a robber?

66
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.300
No.

67
00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:40.867
I assure you.
I'm a man of honor.

68
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.533
Mom!

69
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.300
Mom!

70
00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:53.767
Henry.

71
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.467
Oh. sorry.

72
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.367
Mom?

73
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.867
- Yeah?
- You know how we're supposed

74
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.734
to keep critters
out of the barn?

75
00:03:58.867 --> 00:03:59.600
Yes.

76
00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:02.333
But what if
the critter's a man?

77
00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:03.767
There's a guy eating turnips
in the barn.

78
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.033
I think he's homeless.

79
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.834
What?

80
00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:08.467
He said he's not a bad guy.

81
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.700
You spoke to him?

82
00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:10.700
Only a little.

83
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.867
Oh. Dad!

84
00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:25.633
Who's in here?
I've got a gun!

85
00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:26.834
No. please. I yield!

86
00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:36.100
How did you do that?
Are you a witch?

87
00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:37.967
She was.
last Halloween.

88
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.934
Henry!
I told you to stay inside.

89
00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:42.600
Please do not shoot me. witch.

90
00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:44.467
Keep calling me that.
Give me a reason.

91
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600
What are you doing in my barn?

92
00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.033
I'm sorry. I...
seem to have confused things.

93
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.533
I've hit my head.

94
00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.133
Was that before or after
you robbed a costume shop?

95
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.500
I wonder. may I speak
with your husband?

96
00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:57.266
- No. you can't.
- He's gone.

97
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.266
- Henry.
- Oh.

98
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.700
My condolences.

99
00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:00.667
Keep 'em.

100
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.266
Oh. you're a spinster!

101
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.166
Forced to wear pants
and look mannish.

102
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.233
to protect your family?

103
00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.367
Okay. now you're pushing it.

104
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500
I pray you are not offended?

105
00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:10.400
Do not come any closer!

106
00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.500
I am not a spinster
and I am offended.

107
00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:13.567
Go get Grandpa. Go!

108
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.934
And leave you here alone?

109
00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:16.166
Henry. now!

110
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.367
You live with your father?

111
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.500
My mistake.

112
00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.533
Do not move any closer.

113
00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.266
Dad!

114
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.767
Stay right there.
Don't move.

115
00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.033
Honest mistake.

116
00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:30.700
You have pants on.

117
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.033
Dad?

118
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:36.033
Didn't you hear me?

119
00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:37.233
Hear what?

120
00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:39.266
I was calling you.
Dinner's ready.

121
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.900
There's a homeless guy
in the barn.

122
00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:41.767
What?

123
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.834
Why didn't you tell me?

124
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.500
He seems a little off.
I think he hit his head.

125
00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:46.700
Is that gun loaded?

126
00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:47.867
No. I didn't have time.

127
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.200
But I think he's harmless.

128
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.600
I think
I need a first-aid kit.

129
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.533
This is so cool.

130
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.100
We'd better get Ted out here.

131
00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:56.233
Really?

132
00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.700
I think he's just
lost and confused.

133
00:05:57.834 --> 00:05:59.900
And hungry! I mean.
how hungry do you have to be

134
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.033
to eat raw turnips?

135
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.767
Mm! This is quite possibly
the best stew I have ever eaten.

136
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.233
Seriously?

137
00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.667
The man clearly
has a refined palate.

138
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.734
The man's probably
got a name.

139
00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:16.000
Who are you?

140
00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:19.000
R...

141
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.333
Rip... I believe.

142
00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:25.900
My Christian name is Richard...

143
00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:27.834
but everyone calls me Rip.

144
00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:29.367
Got a last name
to go with that?

145
00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:33.633
It is...

146
00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:34.934
that's odd.

147
00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:36.467
Well. I'm Sarah.

148
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.100
and that is my father. Calvin.
and Henry.

149
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.233
You don't remember

150
00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.667
- your last name?
- Henry.

151
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.433
Strange.

152
00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:45.967
Since I woke.
it's as if I'm in a fog.

153
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.600
I just...

154
00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:50.066
I remember bits and pieces.

155
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.000
I'm not sure
from whence I have come

156
00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:53.200
or where I am going.

157
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.934
The countryside...

158
00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:59.066
the landmarks.
they all...

159
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.033
seem familiar. yet...

160
00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:03.700
they're all sitting strangely.

161
00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:06.367
Well. where are you from.
originally?

162
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.200
Here.

163
00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:16.967
I would say here.

164
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.500
Okay.

165
00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:19.867
Did you ever meet
the Harrisons?

166
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.200
They had the next farm over.

167
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.633
They sold it about...

168
00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:24.633
mm. a year
before your mother passed.

169
00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:26.333
then those developers came

170
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.800
and built all those ugly houses
all over the property--

171
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.667
The Harrisons had a boy.
would've been about his age.

172
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.967
He was in the service.
if I recall.

173
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.133
Were you in the military?

174
00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:37.800
Yes. ma'am.

175
00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:40.567
25th Infantry regiment.

176
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.667
I remember. we--

177
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.133
we saw considerable skirmishes
during the war.

178
00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:46.033
I served in the Navy. myself.

179
00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.000
Oh!

180
00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:52.300
Aw. that'll be Ted.

181
00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:53.333
Come on.

182
00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:58.500
What's going on?
Everyone okay?

183
00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:00.467
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's fine.

184
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.700
Except we have
a robber living in our barn now.

185
00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:04.767
You. In the house. Now.

186
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.967
Fine!

187
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.066
In the barn?

188
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.467
Uh. j-- just wait a second.

189
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.367
Um. do you remember
the Harrisons.

190
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.367
who used to live down the road?

191
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.266
Yeah.

192
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.934
So Dad thinks he remembers

193
00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:17.533
maybe they had a son
who was a veteran...?

194
00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:18.767
I don-- I don't know.

195
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.066
but this could possibly be him.

196
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.300
I mean. he may have PTSD.

197
00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:25.800
but I really don't think
that he's--

198
00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:28.567
I'm not dangerous.
if that's your concern.

199
00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.533
You are from
the local constabulary?

200
00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:36.100
The... the what?

201
00:08:36.233 --> 00:08:37.600
Oh. I'm...

202
00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:40.200
Deputy Ted Kohler
with the...

203
00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.734
Doolittle County
Sheriff's Department.

204
00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:46.467
We think Ted can help you
figure out how you got here.

205
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.266
You would like me
to go with him?

206
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.300
He has
the resources to help you.

207
00:08:51.433 --> 00:08:52.367
Yeah.

208
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.567
Whoa. Hey. hey. hey.

209
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.900
Uh. Ted.
That's not necessary.

210
00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:58.467
This is a strange carriage.

211
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.000
You have... no horses?

212
00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.934
Horses?

213
00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:06.967
Oh. yeah. I got 380 of 'em
right under the hood there.

214
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.133
They must be tiny.

215
00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:09.433
Yeah. they're real small.

216
00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:11.500
Why don't you. uh.
get in the back here.

217
00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:13.066
and we'll talk about it?

218
00:09:14.633 --> 00:09:15.800
And you. yeah.
you want to watch your head

219
00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:17.834
as you get in there.

220
00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:19.300
Good. Nice.

221
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.967
Yeah. you can--
you can just get in.

222
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.066
Good luck. Rip.

223
00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:31.000
Good job.
Hey. watch your fingers. okay?

224
00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:32.500
"Rip"?

225
00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:35.834
Is he. uh. some kind of surfer
or something?

226
00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:37.266
Sounds like you're jealous.

227
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.200
Really?

228
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:40.300
Why? Should I be?

229
00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:41.367
Yeah. It's been a whirlwind.

230
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.700
We met an hour ago
and we're already engaged.

231
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.800
Is that right?

232
00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:47.133
Henry found him in the barn.

233
00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:48.500
He fell. he hit his head.

234
00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:50.300
I gave him an ice pack.

235
00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:53.433
but he doesn't seem to remember
who he is or how he got here.

236
00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:56.633
Or what a car is. Yeah.

237
00:09:56.767 --> 00:09:58.800
Okay. well. I'll run him
by the hospital

238
00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:01.467
after I fingerprint him
and get him checked out.

239
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.500
Thank you.

240
00:10:02.633 --> 00:10:03.767
Oh. hey.

241
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.033
Actually. while I'm here.

242
00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:06.100
I didn't--
I don't know if you heard.

243
00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:08.600
but there's a new restaurant
out in New Haven.

244
00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:10.266
Everyone's raving about it

245
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.500
and I was thinking....

246
00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:13.467
You were thinking you'd leave
a man with a concussion

247
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.834
in the back of your squad car

248
00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:16.600
while you make a date?

249
00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:18.800
Fair point. sir.

250
00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:20.700
I'll call you. Okay?

251
00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:22.000
All right.

252
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.734
Your carriage
makes strange sounds.

253
00:10:26.934 --> 00:10:27.767
Well. that's that.

254
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.934
Yep.

255
00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:32.066
At least you didn't
offer him the apple pie. Hmm?

256
00:10:56.567 --> 00:10:59.033
Whoa. whoa. whoa!
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

257
00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.934
Easy.

258
00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:02.667
- Easy.
- What kind of place is this?

259
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.433
Nothing to fear.
it's just a hospital.

260
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.767
They got those.
where you're from?

261
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.867
Yeah.

262
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Nothing to be afraid of.

263
00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:11.000
D-Did you see that?

264
00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:13.600
I did. Yeah.

265
00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:15.934
I'm just gonna go speak
with the Deputy for a minute.

266
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.066
Are you gonna be okay in here?

267
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.500
Okay.

268
00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:22.700
Dr. Bensen.
please report to room 314.

269
00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:24.600
Dr. Bensen to room 314.

270
00:11:26.066 --> 00:11:28.700
So. there's no signs
of concussion

271
00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:30.333
or any other head trauma.

272
00:11:30.467 --> 00:11:32.533
but he's definitely confused.

273
00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:34.767
I asked him the last time
he'd last seen a dentist

274
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.734
and he said he wanted
to get his hair cut.

275
00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:39.266
Yeah. Sounds like our guy.

276
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.000
Yeah. his fingerprints
didn't register

277
00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.367
in any of our databases.

278
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.834
Says his name's "Rip."

279
00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:44.767
- Hmm.
- I don't know.

280
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.000
That's normal.

281
00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:48.066
At this point. I guess
we've got ourselves a John Doe.

282
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.266
Okay. well. we are required
to keep him overnight

283
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.467
for observation.

284
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.600
but you'll let me know
if you find out anything else?

285
00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:56.433
Will do. Thanks. Doc.

286
00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:58.567
Oh. dear.
Now he's up.

287
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.967
Hey! Uh-oh.

288
00:12:37.734 --> 00:12:39.934
Oh!

289
00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:42.100
Apologies. madam.

290
00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:43.667
I did not want to startle you.

291
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.467
but I couldn't think
of what I should say.

292
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.400
Um... "hello"
is always a good way to start.

293
00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:50.934
Yes. of course.

294
00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:51.834
- Yeah.
- Hello.

295
00:12:51.967 --> 00:12:53.000
Hello.

296
00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:54.667
Are you all right?

297
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.133
I stayed
at your hospital last night.

298
00:12:58.367 --> 00:12:59.333
They told me should rest.

299
00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:00.800
but then a woman
in a white uniform

300
00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:02.800
kept coming into my room
every two hours

301
00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:05.667
and waking me up.
asking me if I was sleeping.

302
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.233
It was not restful.

303
00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:10.700
Yeah. um. hospitals
are a little weird like that.

304
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.033
So... here you are.

305
00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:15.200
Again.

306
00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.900
Yes. um...

307
00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.400
I had a question.

308
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:20.600
So you came back.

309
00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.533
Hello.

310
00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:26.667
Apologies
for the intrusion again.

311
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.066
Actually. I wanted to ask
if I could work off the meal

312
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.967
you so generously provided
last night.

313
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.967
Yeah. do you want to pull
pigweed out of the fields?

314
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.233
Henry! That's your job.

315
00:13:35.367 --> 00:13:36.700
But he wants to help.

316
00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:38.400
That is not necessary.

317
00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:40.000
Are you sure
you're all right?

318
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.834
The carriages and doors
and lanterns

319
00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:45.333
all work by themselves.

320
00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:46.967
Am I dead?

321
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.567
Is this Heaven?

322
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.367
If this were Heaven.
I'm not so sure he'd be here.

323
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.133
I am a lucky man
to have a funny daughter.

324
00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:57.834
Are we gonna talk all day

325
00:13:57.967 --> 00:13:59.567
or do you wanna
pull some weeds?

326
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.867
Henry. Go finish
your morning chores

327
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.533
before the bus gets here.

328
00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.433
Thank you.

329
00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:09.467
I think I have something
you could help with.

330
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.667
Come on.

331
00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:16.467
Shouldn't we tell him

332
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.100
he can use
the milking machine?

333
00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.300
Why?

334
00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:21.800
He's doing a better job
than the pump.

335
00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:23.633
Okay.

336
00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:24.967
Um...

337
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.600
well. I was about
to go make some breakfast.

338
00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:29.967
- Mm!
- Eggs and bacon? Real pork.

339
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.100
- What else would it be?
- Vegan?

340
00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:34.867
"Vegan."
I don't know what that is.

341
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.734
No animal product.

342
00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:38.266
Meatless bacon?

343
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.700
Yeah.
Or some people use turkey.

344
00:14:40.834 --> 00:14:42.934
But that's not bacon.
Why would you do that?

345
00:14:43.066 --> 00:14:44.800
Oh. I like this guy
more and more.

346
00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:46.233
Um...

347
00:14:46.367 --> 00:14:48.633
I notice the apple trees
are in want of trenching.

348
00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.567
to help the roots absorb water.

349
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.600
And I wondered
if you have considered

350
00:14:52.734 --> 00:14:54.900
pruning out the center branches
to help avoid the blight?

351
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:55.834
Yeah. that's something--

352
00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:57.033
we would've normally
done that by now.

353
00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:59.800
but it's a bigger job
than the two of us can handle.

354
00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:02.266
Our farmhand. Errol.
he left last winter.

355
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.367
Well. then. I feel obliged
to offer my assistance.

356
00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:21.900
That looks pretty good.

357
00:15:26.734 --> 00:15:28.000
Well. I guess you already know.

358
00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:29.033
but your mystery man

359
00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.266
wandered out of the hospital
this morning.

360
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.133
Yeah. he showed up here.
What'd you find out?

361
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.600
I wish you would've called me.

362
00:15:36.734 --> 00:15:40.533
I ran his prints and mugshots
and nothing's come up at all.

363
00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:42.834
so I sent his prints
over to the military archive.

364
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:44.800
see if we can find
his service records.

365
00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:47.300
So far. nothing back
from them. either.

366
00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:49.967
We really have no idea
who this guy is.

367
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.800
I think it's best
if I take him off your hands.

368
00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:53.033
If he is a veteran

369
00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:55.633
who has some sort of trauma
or PTSD.

370
00:15:55.767 --> 00:15:58.166
then the last place for him
is jail.

371
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.767
No. I'm not talking about
jail necessarily.

372
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.533
There's no warrants out.

373
00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:05.000
unless you want to swear
on a trespassing complaint?

374
00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:06.600
No. No.

375
00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:08.266
I definitely
don't want to do that.

376
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.600
I didn't think so.

377
00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:11.233
But I do think it's fair to say

378
00:16:11.367 --> 00:16:13.000
that he needs
further evaluation.

379
00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:14.333
you know. at a psych hospital

380
00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:15.667
- or something.
- Really?

381
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.867
What else is there?

382
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.867
I mean. I guess
it wouldn't hurt

383
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.100
to let him stay
in the farmhand house

384
00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:21.000
for just. like. a day or two.

385
00:16:21.133 --> 00:16:22.166
Sarah.

386
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.867
Just until we figure out
what's wrong.

387
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.900
I mean. someone could be
worried sick that he's missing.

388
00:16:26.033 --> 00:16:27.567
Sarah. we don't really know
who this guy is.

389
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.700
He could be... Norman Bates.

390
00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:31.600
Or he could be Forrest Gump.

391
00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:32.900
I mean. what if he was
your family. huh?

392
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.767
Would you want him
institutionalized?

393
00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:37.200
You are a good person.

394
00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.200
No.

395
00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.033
Lock your doors.
I mean it.

396
00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.600
First sign of trouble.
you call me.

397
00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:43.667
Of course.

398
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.900
Okay.

399
00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:47.166
Oh.

400
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.667
Um. you never did give me
an answer about this weekend--

401
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.967
the new restaurant?

402
00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:56.133
Oh. Right. right.

403
00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:59.333
- Oh. you're asking. Now.
- Yeah.

404
00:16:59.467 --> 00:17:01.166
Um. Yeah. Yeah. sure.

405
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.233
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

406
00:17:02.367 --> 00:17:03.233
- Great.
- Yeah.

407
00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:04.967
Okay. well. um.

408
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.567
I will pick you up
on Saturday at seven.

409
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.600
and in the meantime.
anything odd happens...

410
00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:11.266
You'll be the first one I call.

411
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.567
Thank you.

412
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.066
All right.

413
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.633
- See ya.
- See ya.

414
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.967
Ahem.

415
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.333
Um. so. I was thinking
that once we finish up here.

416
00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:40.433
maybe we can try and find out
a little bit more

417
00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:41.567
about your chest--

418
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.734
your... your past?

419
00:17:42.867 --> 00:17:44.433
Your-- your... your pa--

420
00:17:44.567 --> 00:17:46.667
I'm gonna... I'm--

421
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.333
Look. uh. why don't you take
these things into the barn?

422
00:17:56.467 --> 00:17:57.767
Go right on in.

423
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.867
Hey.

424
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.567
Uh. so. the Harrisons
that lived down the road.

425
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.133
they do have a son.

426
00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:07.533
and check out this article
that I found on him.

427
00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:10.000
"Local Man
Receives Purple Heart."

428
00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:11.900
Does that sound
familiar to you?

429
00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:13.367
Were you wounded?

430
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.567
Did you receive a medal?

431
00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.333
Yes.

432
00:18:17.467 --> 00:18:18.834
I-I was wounded in battle

433
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.800
a-and I was awarded
a commendation.

434
00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.133
Okay.

435
00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:25.567
Well. with all that hair.

436
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.533
how can we tell
if that's him?

437
00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:31.233
How would you feel
about a haircut and a shave?

438
00:18:33.767 --> 00:18:35.767
All right. Chin up?

439
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.500
So... what are
we in the mood for?

440
00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:44.266
Mm. Something
a little more clean-cut.

441
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.066
What is that thing?

442
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.033
Normally. only little kids
get scared of the clippers.

443
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.533
You're fine.
Really. it's okay.

444
00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.500
Yeah. just...

445
00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:07.800
...just. uh. sit down--
there you go.

446
00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:14.166
All right.

447
00:19:20.133 --> 00:19:22.066
That is not the same guy.

448
00:19:23.433 --> 00:19:25.567
Who are you then?

449
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.467
You said
you were in the military

450
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.367
and that you were wounded.

451
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.834
Was it Iraq?

452
00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:30.867
Afghanistan?

453
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.033
Do you remember anything?

454
00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:35.033
I don't know of those battles.

455
00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:37.500
Our regiment
never got south of Delaware.

456
00:19:37.633 --> 00:19:38.867
Delaware?

457
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.700
Who were you fighting
in Delaware?

458
00:19:40.834 --> 00:19:41.734
The British.

459
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.166
Hey. Waylon.
Just finishing up here.

460
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.567
Afternoon. Bud.
Hello. Sarah.

461
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.867
Hello.

462
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.033
Calvin.

463
00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:55.066
I never saw you at the VFW
the other night.

464
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.467
Well. it was storming. Waylon.

465
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.967
Some of us have property
to look after.

466
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.333
Or I suppose some of us are
just more dedicated than others.

467
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.800
I'm. uh. Waylon Finster.

468
00:20:06.934 --> 00:20:08.867
How do you do? I'm Rip.

469
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.934
Uh. Rip was just telling us

470
00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:12.166
how he was fighting the British
in Delaware.

471
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.400
Aren't you the funny one?

472
00:20:14.533 --> 00:20:16.700
Well. that's not really true.

473
00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:18.400
Because that would be crazy.

474
00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:20.900
The farthest south
we had battles was New Jersey.

475
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.133
Re-enactments.

476
00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:24.967
Yeah. Yeah.

477
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.633
Oh. You know...

478
00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:30.967
I'm a Revolutionary War buff myself.

479
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.867
I'm quite an admirer
of that period.

480
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.166
We waged war...

481
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.066
often against former kinsmen.

482
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.667
It was a terrible
and grueling time.

483
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.033
Are you saying
that you enjoyed it?

484
00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:42.734
I think it's time for us to go.

485
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:43.934
- Dad?
- Yeah.

486
00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:46.066
Nice seeing you.

487
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.467
Uh. thanks. Bud!

488
00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:53.200
Uh. Mr. Rip?

489
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.633
Good luck.

490
00:20:54.767 --> 00:20:55.734
Thank you.

491
00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:57.033
You eat it.

492
00:20:57.166 --> 00:20:58.900
- Eat it?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Let's go.

493
00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:01.166
Good seeing you. Waylon.

494
00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:03.600
Right.

495
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.967
I fear I may have offended
your friend.

496
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.266
Who? That guy?

497
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.100
Ha! He's a know-it-all

498
00:21:11.233 --> 00:21:13.633
who thinks he invented
the American Revolution.

499
00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:14.800
To hear him talk.

500
00:21:14.934 --> 00:21:17.200
he was leading
the troops himself.

501
00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:18.300
How absurd.

502
00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:19.400
Exactly.

503
00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:22.133
He bears no resemblance
to General Washington.

504
00:21:22.266 --> 00:21:25.066
Okay. come--

505
00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:28.700
Come on. Paul Revere.

506
00:21:28.834 --> 00:21:30.600
This way.

507
00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:32.133
Gotta get to the car that way.

508
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.266
What are you doing?

509
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.800
You give these to children?

510
00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:38.800
You have to take
the wrapper off.

511
00:21:38.934 --> 00:21:40.400
That outside part.

512
00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:42.033
Oh... all right.

513
00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:50.367
We're fixing the holes where
the raccoons are getting in.

514
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.767
He. um. he does seem to know
his way around a farm.

515
00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:57.233
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

516
00:21:57.367 --> 00:21:59.867
We are not paying him
a nickel a day to work here.

517
00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:01.700
Well. I guess not.

518
00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:06.000
But I was thinking of something
a little more long-term.

519
00:22:06.133 --> 00:22:08.333
if we could work it out.

520
00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:13.233
Hmm.

521
00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:18.133
Well. I guess we could ask him.

522
00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:21.767
Hey. Rip.

523
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.800
Um...

524
00:22:23.934 --> 00:22:25.300
so. what would you think about

525
00:22:25.433 --> 00:22:27.300
coming to work for us
as a farmhand?

526
00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:28.767
We can't pay much.

527
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.367
um. but it'll be fair.

528
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.000
and I promise
you'll be well-fed.

529
00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:34.533
You could even stay in
the farmhand house.

530
00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:36.200
It's old and drafty.

531
00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:38.900
but the roof is good
and it'll keep you dry.

532
00:22:45.567 --> 00:22:47.767
So. it's small but cozy.

533
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.500
Errol lived
and worked here

534
00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:51.567
even before
we bought this farm.

535
00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:54.333
Are you all right?

536
00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:56.667
I promise. it's not that bad.

537
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.300
This is where I grew up.

538
00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:01.500
I-It's all coming back
to me now.

539
00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:03.367
This is my house.

540
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.567
Maybe it just looks
like your house?

541
00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:10.433
So this is it.

542
00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:18.066
No.

543
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.834
This-- This isn't right.
Everything is new.

544
00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:23.500
No. No. it's actually not new.

545
00:23:23.633 --> 00:23:26.033
You might...

546
00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:28.700
actually want to sweep out
some of these cobwebs.

547
00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:31.967
I'm most certain
about this place.

548
00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:38.700
There.

549
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:40.266
Indeed. Do you see that?

550
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.433
See what?

551
00:23:41.567 --> 00:23:42.500
Right there in the wood.

552
00:23:42.633 --> 00:23:45.333
Well. those markings
are from before our time.

553
00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:46.934
What does it say?

554
00:23:47.066 --> 00:23:48.500
Roman numerals?

555
00:23:48.633 --> 00:23:50.400
Those... are initials.

556
00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.000
My initials.

557
00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.367
"Rip Van Winkle
the Second."

558
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.934
Rip Van Winkle?

559
00:23:56.066 --> 00:23:57.166
Like the story?

560
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.367
What story?

561
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.266
I was eight--
I was eight when I carved these.

562
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.100
and by mother was so upset
that she--

563
00:24:04.233 --> 00:24:05.400
she took the switch to me.

564
00:24:05.533 --> 00:24:08.100
So what are those numbers then?

565
00:24:08.233 --> 00:24:10.633
Oh. that's my birthday.

566
00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:12.834
The eighth of April. 1758.

567
00:24:12.967 --> 00:24:14.467
Gimme a break.

568
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.834
What would
you like me to break?

569
00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:17.567
1758?

570
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.100
So you'd... you're. like.
a thousand years old.

571
00:24:20.233 --> 00:24:22.667
More like 250.
but he's just joking.

572
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.166
No. I'm-- I'm 31 years of age.

573
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.633
So you were born in. like... 1991.

574
00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.300
1991? Now you're the one
who's being funny.

575
00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:31.900
No. 1758!

576
00:24:32.033 --> 00:24:33.834
It's 2022.

577
00:24:33.967 --> 00:24:35.667
No. it's 1789.

578
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.467
No... 2022.

579
00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:44.333
Twenty...

580
00:24:44.467 --> 00:24:46.567
20...

581
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.433
How is that even possi...

582
00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:50.800
Rip?

583
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.667
This is what happens
when you hire a guy

584
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.767
who's willing to work
for five cents a day.

585
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.834
Is he dead?

586
00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:00.467
- No.
- No.

587
00:25:03.767 --> 00:25:06.867
Oh... I'm home.

588
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.033
How are you feeling?

589
00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:14.066
I was having
the oddest of dreams.

590
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.633
I... I somehow found myself...

591
00:25:16.767 --> 00:25:19.967
In the year 2022?

592
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.700
Oh...

593
00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:23.433
This could go on all night.

594
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:29.734
Okay. just-just relax. okay?

595
00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:30.934
Get your bearings.

596
00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:36.900
Welcome back.
I've got something for you.

597
00:25:37.033 --> 00:25:39.400
I knew I had this
on the bookshelf somewhere.

598
00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:40.600
Here.

599
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.834
Take a little bit
and read that.

600
00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:47.800
"The Sketchbook
of Geoffrey Crayon"?

601
00:25:47.934 --> 00:25:50.633
Read the story
where the bookmark is.

602
00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:53.400
We'll just. uh. be here

603
00:25:53.533 --> 00:25:56.600
until you've had a chance
to take all that in.

604
00:26:12.667 --> 00:26:14.500
You all right?

605
00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:17.767
This story...

606
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.200
it's about my father.

607
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.033
It's an old folk tale.

608
00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:23.767
It's not real.

609
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.300
No. this Washington Irving...
I-I know him.

610
00:26:27.433 --> 00:26:29.633
He's a boy who's always
lingering about the tavern

611
00:26:29.767 --> 00:26:31.000
which my father frequents.

612
00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:34.533
So. you're saying
that Washington Irving

613
00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:36.033
took your father's true story

614
00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:38.700
and passed it off
as fiction.

615
00:26:38.834 --> 00:26:40.000
is that right?

616
00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:41.500
No!

617
00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:43.967
It's clearly preposterous.

618
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.367
- Thank you.
- My father

619
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.433
is a liar and a drunk.

620
00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:49.133
His story was absurd.

621
00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:53.033
You're not from ancient times.
That's impossible.

622
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.533
I was born in this house
on that date I carved.

623
00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:00.166
I was christened
after my father.

624
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.500
Richard Van Winkle. Senior.

625
00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:03.834
He was

626
00:27:03.967 --> 00:27:05.100
a man of minor ambition.

627
00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:07.667
which did not sit well
with my mother.

628
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.433
She was a woman
of flaring tempers.

629
00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:12.433
with ample wind to fan them.

630
00:27:12.567 --> 00:27:15.667
Considering the harsh state
of my parents' union.

631
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.100
it should not have come
as a surprise

632
00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:20.233
when my father
disappeared completely...

633
00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:23.533
and yet I keenly felt
his absence.

634
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.266
The burden of the farmwork
fell to me from a young age.

635
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.934
His abandonment

636
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:32.100
became like coals
from a low-stoked fire.

637
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.133
It fueled my determination
not to be like him.

638
00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:40.934
When I was 17.

639
00:27:41.066 --> 00:27:43.867
the storm that had been brewing
began to blow.

640
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.467
even into
this tranquil valley.

641
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:51.000
And thus.
I found myself fighting

642
00:27:51.133 --> 00:27:53.066
in that grim and bloody conflict

643
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.934
which would make of this
a free nation.

644
00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:23.333
Our independence was won
at great cost.

645
00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:25.233
I was wounded.

646
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:28.000
but even in that.
I was luckier than most.

647
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.467
Times were hard.

648
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.233
but the farm was constant.

649
00:28:34.367 --> 00:28:36.367
and we still had the land
to provide for us.

650
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.433
As time passed.

651
00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:42.800
my mother passed on to her maker
and my sister married.

652
00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:45.600
I was left to tend the field.

653
00:28:45.734 --> 00:28:48.433
and fight the gnawing sting
of my father's abandonment.

654
00:28:50.567 --> 00:28:53.266
And so. it was with
quite some astonishment. then.

655
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.600
that. one day.

656
00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.233
a strangely familiar figure

657
00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:58.533
appeared as if an apparition
from the mountains.

658
00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:07.066
After 20 years.
my father had returned.

659
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.467
and to excuse
his craven desertion.

660
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.400
he concocted
the most outlandish tale...

661
00:29:15.633 --> 00:29:17.800
...he claimed that he had
gone hunting for game

662
00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:19.967
up amidst the local hills.

663
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.667
After trailing
much farther than planned.

664
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.667
he came into a high dell.

665
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.633
Here. he found
a stash of brandy

666
00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:29.133
in a curious cave.

667
00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:31.867
After helping himself
to that brandy.

668
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.166
my father claimed

669
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.734
that a fearsome thunderstorm
roared across the valley.

670
00:29:36.867 --> 00:29:38.166
And it was here. he stated.

671
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.900
that he must have
fallen asleep...

672
00:29:40.033 --> 00:29:41.533
for 20 years.

673
00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:46.133
Of course.
it was a preposterous claim.

674
00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:48.066
and I determined to prove

675
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.567
that there was
no mineral-laden cave

676
00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.266
as he described.

677
00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:54.700
However.
after a prolonged journey

678
00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:56.467
up past Katterskill Point.

679
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.200
nestled along the eastern ridge
of the mountain.

680
00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:01.300
I was forced
to temper my disbelief

681
00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:02.900
when I came upon such a cave.

682
00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:08.800
My timing was fortuitous.

683
00:30:08.934 --> 00:30:10.300
for. at that point.

684
00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:12.800
the dark rolling clouds
which had been pursuing me

685
00:30:12.934 --> 00:30:13.834
laid to.

686
00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:16.467
as if the heavens themselves
were rent.

687
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.533
To my surprise.
there was a flagon--

688
00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:22.800
just as my father had told.

689
00:30:22.934 --> 00:30:25.967
And as the chill of the storm
settled upon my bones.

690
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.200
I was obliged to warm myself
with a swig from that brandy.

691
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:32.233
And as the storm raged.

692
00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:35.166
I fell into a deep slumber.

693
00:30:46.433 --> 00:30:48.133
When I awoke.

694
00:30:48.266 --> 00:30:51.033
I became aware
of a ravenous hunger

695
00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:52.567
and set down the mountain.

696
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.533
But I found myself

697
00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:58.166
in a strange
and altered landscape.

698
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.633
Where mighty pines had stood
just hours before.

699
00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:02.400
there was now brush and bramble.

700
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:05.967
And prolific streams

701
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.133
had turned into rock
and impenetrable woods.

702
00:31:09.266 --> 00:31:12.400
It was though I was looking
upon the world anew.

703
00:31:12.533 --> 00:31:14.467
and I understood not why.

704
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:18.033
My mind was cloudy.

705
00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:20.934
as if I had been through
some dream.

706
00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:25.567
It was shortly after that.

707
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.266
I encountered all of you
in the barn.

708
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.300
I know
how far-fetched this sounds.

709
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.767
No.

710
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.100
You're the son
of Rip Van Winkle.

711
00:31:57.734 --> 00:32:01.533
You decided to disprove
your father's story...

712
00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:05.700
that Washington Irving had
turned into a work of fiction...

713
00:32:08.266 --> 00:32:10.533
but you wound up falling asleep
in a cave in the mountain.

714
00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:11.667
just like your dad.

715
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.533
and then you woke up here...

716
00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:17.033
in 2022.

717
00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:22.834
Well...

718
00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:24.600
yes.

719
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:27.233
It appears so.

720
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.934
That's crazier
than Grandpa's alien story.

721
00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:33.200
You know what?

722
00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:34.834
I think it is time
to get you to bed.

723
00:32:34.967 --> 00:32:35.800
What do you say. Dad?

724
00:32:35.934 --> 00:32:37.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:41.367
Um... I hope you will find
the house more comfortable

726
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.166
than a hospital.

727
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.800
Goodnight.

728
00:32:44.934 --> 00:32:46.734
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

729
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.000
That's a good idea.

730
00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.600
I'm not afraid.

731
00:33:07.734 --> 00:33:09.834
I-I just think
he's confused.

732
00:33:09.967 --> 00:33:12.967
But. um. Ted said
to lock the doors. so...

733
00:33:14.734 --> 00:33:16.667
Yeah.

734
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.700
I'm getting to an age

735
00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:22.867
when I will take "interesting
with a side of crazy"

736
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.033
over sane and boring.
any old day.

737
00:33:27.133 --> 00:33:28.266
Goodnight. Flash.

738
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.066
Goodnight. Grandpa.

739
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.400
So?

740
00:33:31.533 --> 00:33:33.500
Can we keep him?
He's kinda cool.

741
00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:35.934
Okay. Time for bed. you.

742
00:33:36.066 --> 00:33:37.367
Mom!

743
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.934
Look. I'm gonna talk to Ted

744
00:33:39.066 --> 00:33:40.834
and we're gonna figure
all this out. okay?

745
00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:42.333
Ted ruins everything!

746
00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:44.000
Ted does not ruin everything.

747
00:33:44.133 --> 00:33:45.600
He'll just take him away.

748
00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:47.533
Look. I just want to make sure

749
00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:50.433
that that man gets
the help that he needs. Okay?

750
00:33:50.567 --> 00:33:53.066
All right. Goodnight.
I love you.

751
00:34:10.934 --> 00:34:11.800
Bye. honey!

752
00:34:39.633 --> 00:34:41.033
Hey. freak.

753
00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:43.333
My uncle Waylon says
you and your grandpa

754
00:34:43.467 --> 00:34:45.066
aren't the weirdest people
around town anymore.

755
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.567
Shut up. Wiley.

756
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.233
Says that you got
a freak living with you.

757
00:34:48.367 --> 00:34:49.567
I'm not surprised.

758
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.400
Freaks like to hang together.

759
00:34:51.533 --> 00:34:54.066
I'd rather be a freak
than a Neanderthal!

760
00:34:57.934 --> 00:34:58.800
All right. yes.

761
00:34:58.934 --> 00:35:00.600
I will. uh...

762
00:35:00.734 --> 00:35:01.867
talk to him

763
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.633
about keeping his dog
off your lawn.

764
00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:05.967
Yes. absolutely.

765
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.233
Mrs. Kaufman.
let me call you back.

766
00:35:07.367 --> 00:35:10.166
Okay. Yeah. I promise. I will. Bye.

767
00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:12.233
- Sarah.
- Hi.

768
00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:14.233
Hi.
What a pleasant surprise.

769
00:35:14.367 --> 00:35:16.233
I wasn't expecting
to see you today.

770
00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:18.367
Yeah. I was just
picking some things up

771
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.934
and decided to say hi.

772
00:35:21.066 --> 00:35:22.800
Well. I'm so glad you did.

773
00:35:22.934 --> 00:35:24.400
Yeah.

774
00:35:26.433 --> 00:35:27.967
Sorry. Um...

775
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.700
- Have a seat here.
- Oh. thank you.

776
00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:33.633
- Um... oh.
- Oh!

777
00:35:33.767 --> 00:35:34.700
Okay.

778
00:35:34.834 --> 00:35:36.700
Um...

779
00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:37.767
So?

780
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.767
So. yeah.

781
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.734
Yeah. uh.

782
00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:43.433
I-I was wondering.
have you heard more on Rip?

783
00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:45.233
Why?

784
00:35:45.367 --> 00:35:47.100
W-What's wrong?
Did he do something?

785
00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:48.734
No. No. Not at all.

786
00:35:48.867 --> 00:35:50.600
I knew this was a mistake.

787
00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:53.767
No! No. He's polite
and he works hard.

788
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.233
I was just curious
if you heard back

789
00:35:56.367 --> 00:35:58.133
from the military
about an I.D. for him?

790
00:35:58.266 --> 00:36:00.300
Nothing yet. No.

791
00:36:00.433 --> 00:36:02.600
Maybe it's time
we call in some help?

792
00:36:02.734 --> 00:36:04.133
What would that entail?

793
00:36:04.266 --> 00:36:05.934
Uh. well. we could

794
00:36:06.066 --> 00:36:09.433
have him committed by the county
under a 5150.

795
00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.533
I mean. just until they get
a sense of what's going on.

796
00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.033
Committed?

797
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:14.700
Look. Sarah. I know you think
I'm going overboard here.

798
00:36:14.834 --> 00:36:16.700
but if this guy
is really unstable.

799
00:36:16.834 --> 00:36:19.834
he doesn't belong anywhere near
you or Henry or your dad.

800
00:36:19.967 --> 00:36:21.200
Okay?
We need to be prudent.

801
00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:23.533
I can't protect you out there.

802
00:36:23.667 --> 00:36:25.367
He's harmless.

803
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.367
Well. I-I-I hope so.
I hope so.

804
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.166
But. I don't know.
what would you like me to do?

805
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.834
You know what?
Never mind.

806
00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:35.166
I'll just. uh.
I'll figure it out

807
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.367
and I'll let you know.

808
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.600
But. in the meantime.

809
00:36:37.734 --> 00:36:38.834
would you mind letting me know

810
00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:40.300
if the military
gets back to you?

811
00:36:40.433 --> 00:36:42.200
Yeah. okay.

812
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.433
Thank you. See ya.

813
00:36:44.567 --> 00:36:46.500
See ya.

814
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.133
Hey. I left you a snack
on the counter

815
00:36:56.266 --> 00:36:57.300
and then I want you
to come out here

816
00:36:57.433 --> 00:37:00.433
and help me load up
for the farmer's market. okay?

817
00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:03.200
Hey. Would you
come here. please?

818
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.767
Honey. what happened?

819
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.767
It's not a big deal.

820
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.734
Well. it looks like
a big deal to me.

821
00:37:10.867 --> 00:37:12.767
Mom. just... let it alone!

822
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.834
Henry!

823
00:37:38.467 --> 00:37:40.667
Permission to approach
your castle. Sir Henry?

824
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.500
It's just a rock.

825
00:37:43.633 --> 00:37:45.066
Well...

826
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200
when I was your age.

827
00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:48.667
rocks were hardly ever
just rocks.

828
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.967
More often. they were
watchtowers or ramparts.

829
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.667
There used to be
two big boulders

830
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.367
right over there.

831
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.400
That was "Fort Duquesne."

832
00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:01.567
What's that?

833
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.600
It was an outpost
in the French and Indian War.

834
00:38:04.734 --> 00:38:07.100
Oh. More ancient history.

835
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.767
Things did not go well
at school?

836
00:38:16.934 --> 00:38:18.734
I hate Wiley Shump!

837
00:38:18.867 --> 00:38:20.166
Who is Wiley Shump?

838
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.133
Just this kid.

839
00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.667
He's really big.
I wish I could kick his butt!

840
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.600
Hmm.

841
00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:29.467
See that wall?

842
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.500
Yeah?

843
00:38:30.633 --> 00:38:32.400
I built that.

844
00:38:32.533 --> 00:38:34.734
Some of those rocks
were nearly as big as me.

845
00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:38.233
but I learned to use leverage
to move them.

846
00:38:38.367 --> 00:38:41.400
I moved those stones
onto that wall.

847
00:38:41.533 --> 00:38:42.667
So?

848
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.266
So...

849
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.000
rocks. soldiers. scoundrels.
Shumps--

850
00:38:48.133 --> 00:38:50.333
there are ways to use
their size against them.

851
00:38:51.934 --> 00:38:53.800
You mean...

852
00:38:53.934 --> 00:38:55.800
you could teach me
to beat up Wiley?

853
00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.500
I have seen a lot of combat.

854
00:39:00.633 --> 00:39:02.033
It's awful.

855
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.567
Fighting is a terrible thing

856
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.867
and it should be avoided
if there is any other way.

857
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.233
But if you find yourself
with no options.

858
00:39:09.367 --> 00:39:10.633
yes.

859
00:39:10.767 --> 00:39:14.100
I can teach you ways
to defend yourself.

860
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.867
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

861
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.133
Oh. and don't forget
to sauté those beet greens.

862
00:39:19.266 --> 00:39:20.633
They are delicious.

863
00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:22.000
Yeah. Have a good one.

864
00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:25.166
Those ladies are back again.

865
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.400
Would you ladies care
for another sample

866
00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:29.734
of our homemade apple butter?

867
00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:30.700
Yeah.

868
00:39:30.834 --> 00:39:32.333
Maybe you would like
to take some home.

869
00:39:32.467 --> 00:39:33.367
It's only five shillings--

870
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.567
- Dollars.
- ...Dollars a jar.

871
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.667
I'll take a bottle.

872
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.633
I'll take two!

873
00:39:37.767 --> 00:39:38.934
Very well.

874
00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:41.533
He certainly seems to be able
to make friends very easily.

875
00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:42.467
Are you gonna keep making jokes

876
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.233
or are you gonna
go help the customers?

877
00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:45.767
I'm gonna go help
the customers.

878
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200
Hi!

879
00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:50.300
Hi. That's Five apiece.

880
00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:51.567
Thanks.

881
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.600
Pardon me.

882
00:40:40.734 --> 00:40:42.867
I didn't mean to disturb you.

883
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.533
You're not disturbing me.

884
00:40:44.667 --> 00:40:45.500
There was an errant chicken

885
00:40:45.633 --> 00:40:47.967
who decided to roost
outside my window.

886
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.633
I was helping her
find her way back to the coop.

887
00:40:51.767 --> 00:40:53.533
You seem to be
enjoying your evening.

888
00:40:53.667 --> 00:40:54.900
Yeah.

889
00:40:55.033 --> 00:40:57.433
Just enjoying
a rare moment of quiet.

890
00:40:57.567 --> 00:41:00.333
Henry's asleep
and Dad's at the VFW.

891
00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:02.000
Apologies
for the interruption.

892
00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:03.367
I shall take my leave.

893
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.533
I mean. you can stay.
if you want.

894
00:41:05.667 --> 00:41:07.834
I'm just playing a game
on my phone.

895
00:41:07.967 --> 00:41:09.000
Here. come here.
I'll show you.

896
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.467
Only if you're sure
I'm not disturbing you. ma'am.

897
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.467
The only thing disturbing me
is you calling me "ma'am."

898
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.300
Propriety would require--

899
00:41:15.433 --> 00:41:17.433
Okay. it's not
the 18th century anymore.

900
00:41:17.567 --> 00:41:18.667
I am unaccustomed

901
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.133
to any woman over the age of 20
being unaccounted for.

902
00:41:22.266 --> 00:41:23.900
Especially
an incredibly pretty one.

903
00:41:25.934 --> 00:41:27.867
Um. apologies.
I've-- I've overstepped.

904
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.300
Trust me. I'll let you know
when you've overstepped.

905
00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:31.934
Hmm.

906
00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:34.567
All right. come here.
Let me show you this.

907
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.100
That is quite an object.
your flashy thingamajig.

908
00:41:40.233 --> 00:41:41.967
My phone?

909
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.533
Yeah. I guess it kind of is.

910
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.633
Phone...

911
00:41:45.767 --> 00:41:47.133
how does it work?

912
00:41:47.266 --> 00:41:49.467
That. I don't know.

913
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.433
but I can show you what it does.

914
00:41:51.567 --> 00:41:52.633
All right.

915
00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:55.533
So. this game...

916
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:58.467
is really just a fun way
of knocking things down.

917
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.200
See? Yeah.

918
00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:04.000
I'm sure you had games like this
when you were a kid. no?

919
00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:07.200
We had skittles. nine pins--
that sort of thing--

920
00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:09.233
but mostly
we just made our own toys.

921
00:42:09.367 --> 00:42:10.767
Like what?

922
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.800
Um...

923
00:42:25.633 --> 00:42:27.734
That's amazing.

924
00:42:27.867 --> 00:42:29.633
You have to show me
how to do that.

925
00:42:39.133 --> 00:42:41.266
What are you two doing?

926
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.000
Hey. show him.
Do it again. do it again.

927
00:42:43.133 --> 00:42:45.033
Listen to this.

928
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.166
Impressive.

929
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.266
But I'm tired.

930
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.934
I'll see the two of you tomorrow.

931
00:43:01.066 --> 00:43:02.734
Goodnight.
Oh! Um. Dad.

932
00:43:02.867 --> 00:43:04.600
will you carry Henry to bed
for me. please?

933
00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:06.800
- Sure.
- Thank you. Goodnight.

934
00:43:06.934 --> 00:43:08.333
Goodnight.

935
00:43:09.533 --> 00:43:12.333
Okay. come here. you have
to show me how to do that now.

936
00:43:12.467 --> 00:43:14.233
- Certainly.
- I want to know the trick.

937
00:43:14.367 --> 00:43:15.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

938
00:43:15.533 --> 00:43:18.100
You hold the blade of grass
between your two thumbs.

939
00:43:18.233 --> 00:43:19.734
- like so. quite taut.
- Mm-hmm.

940
00:43:19.867 --> 00:43:21.600
And then you just blow.

941
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.867
Sounds like a duck call.

942
00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.100
Morning.

943
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.100
All right. so. are you ready?

944
00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:44.600
Yeah? That way? Okay.

945
00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:49.934
Do you see
how I did that?

946
00:43:50.066 --> 00:43:51.633
By using momentum.

947
00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:52.934
Now you try.

948
00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:55.734
Okay. What you got?
You gonna come at me. Rip?

949
00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:57.633
Watch the strike.

950
00:43:57.767 --> 00:43:59.633
Transfer. walk. grab.

951
00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:01.166
step behind.

952
00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.967
Oh!

953
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.233
Oh!

954
00:44:34.533 --> 00:44:35.967
Ah! Yeah!

955
00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:41.533
No.
I didn't know the pilgrims.

956
00:44:41.667 --> 00:44:42.900
How old do you think I am?

957
00:44:43.033 --> 00:44:45.133
Uh. according to you.
really old.

958
00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.667
Well. the answer's still no.

959
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.500
Thank you so kindly
for the meal.

960
00:44:49.633 --> 00:44:50.900
You're welcome.

961
00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:52.000
Hey. Homework.

962
00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:02.767
Thank you so much
for everything you've done.

963
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.133
Really. I didn't think
we would be able

964
00:45:04.266 --> 00:45:06.066
to get it all done
this season.

965
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.133
It has been my pleasure.

966
00:45:08.266 --> 00:45:09.367
Mm.

967
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.633
May I?

968
00:45:10.767 --> 00:45:12.967
Ah. yeah. of course.

969
00:45:17.033 --> 00:45:20.133
You must be missing
some of your friends and family.

970
00:45:20.266 --> 00:45:21.533
Yes.

971
00:45:21.667 --> 00:45:23.767
There are a few people
I miss very much.

972
00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.800
You married?

973
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.934
I never found much time
for courtship.

974
00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:33.967
Well. we're still young.

975
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:35.967
We are?

976
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.767
Yeah!

977
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.700
My girlfriends in the city.

978
00:45:39.834 --> 00:45:41.734
they put their career
before marriage and kids.

979
00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:43.400
I mean. they won't even
think about it

980
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:44.367
until they feel like

981
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.000
they've really
established themselves.

982
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.233
I admit. when I first arrived.

983
00:45:51.367 --> 00:45:53.734
I have found myself...

984
00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.734
amazed by
these new societal constructs.

985
00:45:55.867 --> 00:45:57.867
No doubt.

986
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.934
Women wear trousers and vote.
and labor at men's jobs...

987
00:46:01.066 --> 00:46:02.166
Mm. Yes. we do.

988
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.100
and just as well.
thank you very much.

989
00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:05.633
As ably as any man could.

990
00:46:05.767 --> 00:46:07.533
- Yep.
- And yet still.

991
00:46:07.667 --> 00:46:10.166
with no less than the perfect
essence of womanhood.

992
00:46:17.567 --> 00:46:20.333
It has stirred in me
a-a realization...

993
00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:21.400
Hmm?

994
00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:24.033
There once was a man
named Thomas Jefferson.

995
00:46:24.166 --> 00:46:26.433
He was a great statesman
and philosopher.

996
00:46:26.567 --> 00:46:28.533
I know
who Thomas Jefferson was.

997
00:46:28.667 --> 00:46:30.200
Well. of course.

998
00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:33.533
The noble Mr. Jefferson
stirred our people to freedom

999
00:46:33.667 --> 00:46:36.500
by declaring
that all men are created equal.

1000
00:46:36.633 --> 00:46:38.367
Mm-hmm.

1001
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.100
However.

1002
00:46:40.233 --> 00:46:44.734
it seems quite evident to me now
that his declaration was flawed.

1003
00:46:46.934 --> 00:46:48.633
Had he known Sarah Majors.

1004
00:46:48.767 --> 00:46:52.700
he should have included women
in his proclamation.

1005
00:46:55.967 --> 00:46:57.800
Thank you.

1006
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.934
So. um... ahem.

1007
00:47:07.066 --> 00:47:09.033
There's a...

1008
00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:10.500
there's a doctor

1009
00:47:10.633 --> 00:47:13.100
at New York College
of Medicine and Technology

1010
00:47:13.233 --> 00:47:14.934
who I contacted.

1011
00:47:15.066 --> 00:47:16.333
I told her about you.

1012
00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:19.333
And she's very interested
in your story

1013
00:47:19.467 --> 00:47:23.066
and very curious to meet you.

1014
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.100
Truthfully?

1015
00:47:24.233 --> 00:47:25.066
Mm-hmm.

1016
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.100
Hey.

1017
00:47:27.233 --> 00:47:28.934
I know. I know. Homework.

1018
00:47:29.066 --> 00:47:30.233
I want you to have this.

1019
00:47:30.367 --> 00:47:31.567
It's a toy.

1020
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.867
You can play with it.

1021
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.700
and then you won't have to be
afraid of the real tractor.

1022
00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:37.000
That's very kind.

1023
00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:39.367
And then maybe you could think
of everything like that.

1024
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.433
Tractors. trucks. helicopters--
like they're all just big toys.

1025
00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:59.233
I would like. very much.
to talk to your expert.

1026
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.767
Okay.

1027
00:48:19.367 --> 00:48:22.033
It's been a long time
since I've been to the city.

1028
00:48:22.166 --> 00:48:23.734
Okay. on that.
I just want to warn you.

1029
00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.800
New York has changed
a little bit.

1030
00:48:25.934 --> 00:48:27.300
Is Broadway still there?

1031
00:48:27.433 --> 00:48:29.133
Yes...

1032
00:48:29.266 --> 00:48:31.200
I once walked
all the way from the Battery

1033
00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:32.467
to Greenwich Village.

1034
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.633
Are those places still there?

1035
00:48:33.767 --> 00:48:34.867
Yes--

1036
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.633
Through Lispenard's Meadow.
past the Manhattan well...

1037
00:48:37.767 --> 00:48:40.166
I know it will look different.
but I'm prepared.

1038
00:48:41.133 --> 00:48:43.500
Okay. I just don't want you
to freak out.

1039
00:48:43.633 --> 00:48:45.934
"Freak out"?

1040
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.834
So this is what I meant
by freaking out.

1041
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.767
- I see.
- Mm.

1042
00:49:11.433 --> 00:49:12.967
As I count backwards.

1043
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.233
your eyes will become
heavier and heavier.

1044
00:49:16.367 --> 00:49:18.033
After I reach one.

1045
00:49:18.166 --> 00:49:20.967
you will be in
a deep hypnotic state.

1046
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.066
Do you understand?

1047
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.967
Yes.

1048
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.633
Five...

1049
00:49:28.767 --> 00:49:30.600
four.

1050
00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.800
three.

1051
00:49:32.934 --> 00:49:34.700
two.

1052
00:49:34.834 --> 00:49:35.934
one.

1053
00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:42.033
Thank you for bringing
his case to my attention.

1054
00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:44.033
It's quite fascinating.

1055
00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:45.767
Can you help him?

1056
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.900
He does seem to have
gone through a war.

1057
00:49:48.033 --> 00:49:50.200
But the most intriguing thing
is that.

1058
00:49:50.333 --> 00:49:51.700
as a coping mechanism.

1059
00:49:51.834 --> 00:49:54.533
I think his brain has created
an elaborate delusion

1060
00:49:54.667 --> 00:49:55.900
which places his trauma

1061
00:49:56.033 --> 00:49:59.734
to a war almost 250 years
in the past.

1062
00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:01.967
I believe this makes it
somehow safer for him.

1063
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.100
Is this common?

1064
00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.533
I mean.
have you seen this before?

1065
00:50:04.667 --> 00:50:06.767
No. It's quite unusual.

1066
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.700
Especially for a patient
to maintain

1067
00:50:08.834 --> 00:50:11.133
such a complex delusion
under hypnosis.

1068
00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:13.467
We'd like to do
a few more tests.

1069
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.133
Yeah. sure.

1070
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.700
Not sure what
this foreign object is.

1071
00:50:20.834 --> 00:50:24.333
but we could remove it simply.
with a local anesthetic.

1072
00:50:28.033 --> 00:50:29.900
Remove it? Now?

1073
00:50:34.433 --> 00:50:35.467
Are you all right?

1074
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.867
I need a leather strap
to bite on.

1075
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.066
Please don't start yet.

1076
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.900
Uh. actually.
we're almost done.

1077
00:50:42.033 --> 00:50:44.066
How did you do that?

1078
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.066
Anesthesia.

1079
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.767
Oh!

1080
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.467
I-I suppose I'm fine. then.

1081
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.967
Yeah.

1082
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.166
What do you think that is?

1083
00:50:58.033 --> 00:51:00.333
I was shot.

1084
00:51:01.734 --> 00:51:03.800
That is
a "Brown Bess" musket ball.

1085
00:51:03.934 --> 00:51:06.433
They stopped making those
in 1820.

1086
00:51:06.567 --> 00:51:09.700
Where. uh...
Where'd you find it?

1087
00:51:09.834 --> 00:51:12.467
It was pulled
from this man's leg.

1088
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.633
I mean. I've heard of these
"re-enactors" going pretty far.

1089
00:51:16.767 --> 00:51:19.834
but you. my friend.
you take the cake.

1090
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.166
How can this even be
the same place?

1091
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.467
I know.
it looks different to me.

1092
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.633
and I only left 10 years ago.

1093
00:51:36.767 --> 00:51:38.166
You lived in New York City?

1094
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.867
Yeah. Yeah. Until Simon left.

1095
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.367
Your husband?

1096
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.967
No. Baby daddy.

1097
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.367
"Baby daddy"?

1098
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.667
Yeah.

1099
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.033
We weren't married.

1100
00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:49.934
I know that sounds unusual
to you.

1101
00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:53.100
but it's really not
that uncommon anymore.

1102
00:51:53.233 --> 00:51:55.166
He left. uh.
right before Henry was born.

1103
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.500
I'm sorry.

1104
00:51:56.633 --> 00:51:57.867
There is nothing less honorable

1105
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.867
than a man abandoning
a woman with child.

1106
00:52:00.066 --> 00:52:02.734
Yeah. well. that's something
we both can agree on.

1107
00:52:02.867 --> 00:52:05.767
Anyway. but really.
I'm fine now.

1108
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.433
So you left the city?

1109
00:52:07.567 --> 00:52:09.033
Yes.

1110
00:52:09.166 --> 00:52:11.233
Uh. so. my parents
had just retired.

1111
00:52:11.367 --> 00:52:14.433
and I admit I was feeling
a bit overwhelmed.

1112
00:52:14.567 --> 00:52:16.834
so I took a hiatus
from my advertising job.

1113
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.567
I thought it would be temporary.

1114
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.400
but then.
my mom got Alzheimer's.

1115
00:52:20.533 --> 00:52:22.066
so I stayed.

1116
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.000
Um. Alzheimer's is a disease

1117
00:52:24.133 --> 00:52:26.400
where you stop being able
to remember things.

1118
00:52:26.533 --> 00:52:27.934
Like me?

1119
00:52:28.066 --> 00:52:30.934
No. Not quite.

1120
00:52:31.066 --> 00:52:34.000
Anyway. it was
a difficult couple of years.

1121
00:52:34.133 --> 00:52:35.567
But you know I realized?

1122
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.767
People need healthy food--

1123
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.900
not food filled with chemicals and...

1124
00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:42.066
that's where I feel like

1125
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.700
I'm really
accomplishing something.

1126
00:53:04.734 --> 00:53:07.066
Why is it called "Edge"?

1127
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.500
I'll show you
if you're up for it.

1128
00:53:19.033 --> 00:53:20.667
Come on.
Walk straight.

1129
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.600
You've got to walk straight.

1130
00:53:28.066 --> 00:53:30.000
Are you sure it's safe
for us to be up this high?

1131
00:53:30.133 --> 00:53:31.000
Yes.

1132
00:53:31.133 --> 00:53:33.266
Okay. you see that building
right there?

1133
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.300
That building is still standing
and it was built 90 years ago.

1134
00:53:36.433 --> 00:53:37.533
Come on.

1135
00:53:41.266 --> 00:53:42.333
Oh. my.

1136
00:53:44.266 --> 00:53:46.800
Yeah. it's pretty impressive.
isn't it?

1137
00:53:46.934 --> 00:53:50.266
I wonder if this is
what Heaven must be like.

1138
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.767
Yeah. I have to admit.
it still takes my breath away.

1139
00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.333
Who'd have dreamed we'd be
capable of such edifices?

1140
00:53:57.467 --> 00:54:01.000
Humans seem intent
on always wanting more.

1141
00:54:01.133 --> 00:54:03.767
going bigger.

1142
00:54:06.333 --> 00:54:08.633
It's reassuring to know
we got it right.

1143
00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:09.900
The architecture?

1144
00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:11.133
No.

1145
00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:13.066
All of this.

1146
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.800
America.

1147
00:54:14.934 --> 00:54:16.533
When we battled
for our independence.

1148
00:54:16.667 --> 00:54:19.934
it was really just a theory... democracy.

1149
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.000
At the time.

1150
00:54:23.133 --> 00:54:24.633
it seemed
like a grand experiment.

1151
00:54:24.767 --> 00:54:27.066
We didn't know if we'd survive.
as a people.

1152
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.166
as a country.

1153
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.867
It's good to see

1154
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.667
that we managed
to figure it out.

1155
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.667
I don't know
that we figured it out.

1156
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.700
I mean. not by a long shot.

1157
00:54:35.834 --> 00:54:38.800
After all this time.
we keep trying.

1158
00:54:38.934 --> 00:54:40.567
I think that's what's important.

1159
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:41.834
Well.

1160
00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:43.333
at the very least.

1161
00:54:43.467 --> 00:54:45.800
it's good to know
that the ideals we fought for--

1162
00:54:45.934 --> 00:54:49.400
they have definitely
amounted to all this.

1163
00:54:49.533 --> 00:54:50.834
When I look around.

1164
00:54:50.967 --> 00:54:54.400
I see something grand
and marvelous.

1165
00:54:57.533 --> 00:55:00.934
It does seem to allow people
to take liberties. I suppose.

1166
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.300
Well. it is pretty romantic.

1167
00:55:12.567 --> 00:55:14.700
When we run out of
probable explanations

1168
00:55:14.834 --> 00:55:17.033
for your story.

1169
00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:21.233
then perhaps it's time
to consider improbable ones.

1170
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.100
We've had a request

1171
00:55:24.233 --> 00:55:26.900
for you to discuss all of this
with Dr. Silver.

1172
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:30.633
He teaches quantum theory
in our physics department.

1173
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.900
You see. we've run different
combinations of elements

1174
00:55:35.033 --> 00:55:36.100
though our computer models

1175
00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:38.300
in order to formulate
an equation that would account

1176
00:55:38.433 --> 00:55:40.734
for certain types
of quantum anomalies.

1177
00:55:40.867 --> 00:55:42.700
Is this a commonplace mysticism
for you?

1178
00:55:42.834 --> 00:55:44.967
Because I understand this about
as well as I do your tractor.

1179
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.467
I have no idea
what he's talking about either.

1180
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.400
Sorry.

1181
00:55:47.533 --> 00:55:48.367
No. no. I'm sorry.

1182
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.333
I may have gotten

1183
00:55:49.467 --> 00:55:50.800
a little carried away
in my excitement.

1184
00:55:50.934 --> 00:55:52.533
You see. you. sir.
may represent

1185
00:55:52.667 --> 00:55:54.734
the living embodiment
of this theory.

1186
00:55:54.867 --> 00:55:56.300
What exactly is the theory?

1187
00:55:56.433 --> 00:55:58.433
Well. let me explain it
to you another way.

1188
00:55:58.567 --> 00:56:00.333
You see. quantum physics
is a science

1189
00:56:00.467 --> 00:56:02.467
which examines
physical phenomena

1190
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.300
usually
along a subatomic scale.

1191
00:56:04.433 --> 00:56:05.834
Now. here's an example.

1192
00:56:05.967 --> 00:56:07.500
We've recently taken
trace amounts

1193
00:56:07.633 --> 00:56:09.000
of new uranium particles

1194
00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:11.033
and placed them
at the Bikini Atoll.

1195
00:56:11.166 --> 00:56:12.867
Where the nuclear bomb
was tested?

1196
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.133
Yes. that's right.

1197
00:56:14.266 --> 00:56:16.100
I don't know
what any of that is.

1198
00:56:16.233 --> 00:56:18.633
That's fine.
but here's what's significant.

1199
00:56:18.767 --> 00:56:20.533
Now. we've noticed disturbances

1200
00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:22.367
in the present-day
uranium particles

1201
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.834
similar to what
we would expect to find

1202
00:56:23.967 --> 00:56:25.033
after a nuclear blast.

1203
00:56:25.166 --> 00:56:29.100
even though that event
took place over 70 years ago.

1204
00:56:29.233 --> 00:56:31.367
You see...

1205
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.967
there seems to be a connection
between the particles

1206
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.266
that exists across time.

1207
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.367
How does that apply
to Rip?

1208
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.033
Well...

1209
00:56:40.166 --> 00:56:42.800
let's imagine that
this is the history of America.

1210
00:56:42.934 --> 00:56:44.500
from the establishment
of the colonies

1211
00:56:44.633 --> 00:56:46.500
all the way
up to the present time.

1212
00:56:46.633 --> 00:56:47.834
Now. we have always assumed

1213
00:56:47.967 --> 00:56:50.300
that time moves us
at a consistent pace.

1214
00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:52.333
just one way.
along this line.

1215
00:56:52.467 --> 00:56:54.667
But the behavior
of the uranium particles

1216
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.934
suggests that great energetic disturbances

1217
00:56:57.066 --> 00:56:58.700
create wormholes.

1218
00:56:58.834 --> 00:57:01.567
Now. this would explain
how a person such as yourself.

1219
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:02.900
from this point in time.

1220
00:57:03.033 --> 00:57:05.000
could end up
at this point in time.

1221
00:57:05.133 --> 00:57:07.333
If the cave that you mentioned

1222
00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:09.667
had high amounts of
lead. zinc. molybdenum.

1223
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.367
and trace amounts of
a radioactive element

1224
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.333
like uranium.
or radium even.

1225
00:57:13.467 --> 00:57:15.767
and it was subject
to intense jolts of energy--

1226
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.000
like the lightning strike
that you described--

1227
00:57:18.133 --> 00:57:21.166
it would effectively
create a wormhole.

1228
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.767
And that wormhole

1229
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.900
would result in a fold.
or a tear in time.

1230
00:57:27.033 --> 00:57:28.900
landing you. my friend...

1231
00:57:30.233 --> 00:57:31.934
...in the future.

1232
00:57:35.233 --> 00:57:37.433
So you're saying
his story is real?

1233
00:57:37.567 --> 00:57:40.900
Do you think I could
get back to my own time?

1234
00:57:41.033 --> 00:57:43.700
The answer to both
your questions

1235
00:57:43.834 --> 00:57:45.967
is. theoretically... yes.

1236
00:57:47.133 --> 00:57:49.200
Yes. it's possible.

1237
00:58:00.133 --> 00:58:01.633
Grand and marvelous.

1238
00:58:01.767 --> 00:58:03.333
What's that?

1239
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.400
Thank you.

1240
00:58:05.533 --> 00:58:07.066
For what?

1241
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.500
For taking me here.

1242
00:58:09.633 --> 00:58:12.400
And for taking my story seriously.

1243
00:58:12.533 --> 00:58:15.133
And for taking me in.

1244
00:58:15.266 --> 00:58:17.767
When you found me
in your barn.

1245
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:21.033
you were very gracious
and trusting.

1246
00:58:22.533 --> 00:58:25.500
I don't pretend
to understand this new world.

1247
00:58:25.633 --> 00:58:26.967
but I believe
I've learned enough to know

1248
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.934
that it was an unlikely
and generous thing.

1249
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.100
You're welcome.

1250
00:58:36.133 --> 00:58:38.967
Do you think what the doctor
told us is true?

1251
00:58:42.033 --> 00:58:43.934
I wish I knew.

1252
00:58:44.066 --> 00:58:46.033
I... I don't know.

1253
00:58:49.734 --> 00:58:51.133
Some days on the farm.

1254
00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:52.633
I...

1255
00:58:52.767 --> 00:58:55.767
I feel as if
there's no place I'd rather be.

1256
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.467
But then.
there are times like this.

1257
00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.633
this trip into the city.

1258
00:58:59.767 --> 00:59:03.333
where I worry I might never
fit into this new world.

1259
00:59:09.166 --> 00:59:11.033
But it sure is something.

1260
00:59:28.867 --> 00:59:29.867
- Hey!
- Hey.

1261
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.233
Is something wrong?

1262
00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.967
No. I don't think so.

1263
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.300
Does something
need to be wrong?

1264
00:59:34.433 --> 00:59:36.367
I just haven't seen you
in a little while.

1265
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.367
Right. I'm sorry.

1266
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.734
I've just been--
I've just been really busy.

1267
00:59:40.867 --> 00:59:41.900
- I thought so.
- Yeah.

1268
00:59:42.033 --> 00:59:43.800
You know. I was thinking.
"Sarah must be so busy..."

1269
00:59:43.934 --> 00:59:45.633
and "Sarah must need a break."

1270
00:59:45.767 --> 00:59:48.100
So. I was thinking we. uh.
grill up some steaks--

1271
00:59:48.233 --> 00:59:50.400
and I brought a nice bottle
of that red that you like--

1272
00:59:50.533 --> 00:59:52.300
Good evening. Deputy.

1273
00:59:53.433 --> 00:59:55.900
Um. it's daytime. but...

1274
00:59:57.567 --> 00:59:58.533
Right.

1275
00:59:58.667 --> 01:00:01.266
Um. Ted-- Ted was just
stopping by to say hello.

1276
01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.967
Hello.

1277
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.967
Yeah. Hello.

1278
01:00:09.767 --> 01:00:11.133
Y-You know. I was hoping

1279
01:00:11.266 --> 01:00:12.767
that I could just have
a little moment with Sarah.

1280
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.033
Just the... two of us.

1281
01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:16.667
Oh.

1282
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.767
Certainly.

1283
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.767
I'll get back to loading
the carriage.

1284
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.533
Uh. "truck."

1285
01:00:23.667 --> 01:00:26.133
Thank you.
Yeah. tha-- that one. Thanks.

1286
01:00:28.266 --> 01:00:29.433
Good day!

1287
01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:31.767
Good day.

1288
01:00:35.367 --> 01:00:36.700
How's it going with him?

1289
01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.567
Giving you any trouble?

1290
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.633
No. Not at all.

1291
01:00:39.767 --> 01:00:40.967
Okay. well. listen.

1292
01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.300
While I'm here.

1293
01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:44.967
I actually got a response from
the National Military Archive.

1294
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.967
and there's absolutely no record

1295
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.133
of your guy ever having
served in the military.

1296
01:00:49.266 --> 01:00:50.433
His name is Rip.

1297
01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:52.934
Yeah. pretty sure
that's not his real name.

1298
01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.800
What are you
trying to say. Ted?

1299
01:00:54.934 --> 01:00:55.934
Well. people in town

1300
01:00:56.066 --> 01:00:58.467
have been talking about
this crazy story of his

1301
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.033
and we're all more than
a little concerned.

1302
01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:06.200
and you know. I've heard of
situations like this before.

1303
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:09.133
Really? You've heard of
situations like Rip's?

1304
01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.767
Situations where
a con artist comes along.

1305
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.133
and tells a wild story
to some easy marks. yeah.

1306
01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:15.300
Oh! Oh. So I assume

1307
01:01:15.433 --> 01:01:17.467
that Dad and I are
the "easy marks" in this story?

1308
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.166
Sarah. come on.

1309
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.500
I'm just worried that he might
be taking advantage of you.

1310
01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:23.700
Ted. I-I can't
do this right now.

1311
01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:24.533
I'm so sorry.

1312
01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:27.200
I-I'm just. like.
I'm really busy.

1313
01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.433
Can we talk later?

1314
01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:29.900
Sure.

1315
01:01:31.467 --> 01:01:32.500
Um. what about this weekend?

1316
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.800
Look. I appreciate the offer.
I am just so slammed right now.

1317
01:01:37.934 --> 01:01:39.500
No. I mean the festival.

1318
01:01:39.633 --> 01:01:40.600
You're gonna come.
aren't you?

1319
01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:42.667
Right. Yes. The festival.

1320
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.533
Of course. I-I-I will be
at the festival.

1321
01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:47.033
Okay. then.

1322
01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:50.500
And maybe another time
for the steaks?

1323
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.934
Sure. Sure.

1324
01:01:54.066 --> 01:01:55.000
Okay.

1325
01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:57.200
Uh. don't work too hard.

1326
01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:59.100
- Thanks.
- All right.

1327
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.400
Mom. they have candy apples!

1328
01:02:22.533 --> 01:02:24.266
You'll be
on a sugar-high all night.

1329
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.433
He'll be fine!

1330
01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:27.900
Come on. I see Bloom's
hard cider stand over there.

1331
01:02:28.033 --> 01:02:30.200
Go easy. both of you!

1332
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.200
Does that bother you?

1333
01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:39.266
No. It rather delights me.

1334
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.200
Don't worry.

1335
01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:42.400
No one's thinking
any the worse of us.

1336
01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:44.667
And even if they were.
I wouldn't care.

1337
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.033
Indeed.

1338
01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:48.200
Why does that not surprise me?

1339
01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:50.033
So what about you. Rip?

1340
01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.533
What do you want to do?

1341
01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.033
At the moment.

1342
01:02:53.166 --> 01:02:54.767
I should like nothing more
than to accompany you

1343
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.166
to wherever
your heart may fancy.

1344
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.333
Ooh. you better be careful.

1345
01:02:57.467 --> 01:02:59.100
You don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

1346
01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.734
Oh. dear.

1347
01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:03.300
Let's go have some fun.

1348
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.066
It's loud!

1349
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.333
Where are the musicians?

1350
01:03:13.467 --> 01:03:16.233
How have they secreted them
inside this box?

1351
01:03:16.367 --> 01:03:18.233
No. that's a speaker!

1352
01:03:18.367 --> 01:03:20.066
You're not supposed to stand
that close to it.

1353
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.467
It's just a recording.
You see that guy?

1354
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.834
He's playing the music.

1355
01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.166
Oh...

1356
01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.500
This is rock music!

1357
01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:29.133
What do you think?

1358
01:03:29.266 --> 01:03:30.900
I'm not sure
I can think at all.

1359
01:03:31.033 --> 01:03:32.433
Good! That's the point.

1360
01:03:32.567 --> 01:03:34.934
You're just supposed to dance!

1361
01:03:35.066 --> 01:03:37.233
It's okay to let yourself go.

1362
01:03:37.367 --> 01:03:39.767
Just listen to the beat
and let your body do the rest.

1363
01:03:41.967 --> 01:03:44.066
Maybe a little more fluid? Yeah.

1364
01:03:47.467 --> 01:03:48.734
Whoo!

1365
01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.200
Whoa. Whoa.

1366
01:03:52.734 --> 01:03:54.133
Or maybe more like this--

1367
01:03:54.266 --> 01:03:56.500
yeah. yeah. there you go.

1368
01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.333
Good.

1369
01:04:03.266 --> 01:04:04.166
That was good.

1370
01:04:06.767 --> 01:04:08.066
Pardon me. kind sir.

1371
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.800
I-I don't imagine
you would be able

1372
01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:12.400
to play something
a bit. um...

1373
01:04:12.533 --> 01:04:13.600
older?

1374
01:04:13.734 --> 01:04:17.900
Perhaps a... a gentle ballad
to which one can dance?

1375
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Well... that's an improvement.

Leave me alone. Wiley.

1397
01:06:12.734 --> 01:06:13.700
What do you got there?

1398
01:06:13.834 --> 01:06:15.800
I'm hungry.

1399
01:06:15.934 --> 01:06:19.767
Oh. yeah. I just remembered--
I hate candy apples.

1400
01:06:25.233 --> 01:06:27.066
Oh! You gonna cry?

1401
01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:31.000
Come on. freak. Stand up.

1402
01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:40.834
That is a genuine
Colonial farming tool

1403
01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:42.700
which was found
near this thresher.

1404
01:06:42.834 --> 01:06:44.133
Well. look.

1405
01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:46.667
It's Calvin Majors.

1406
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.834
Now. have you been telling

1407
01:06:48.967 --> 01:06:51.467
more of those
incredible stories. Calvin?

1408
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.967
Don't tell us.

1409
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.600
You came to America
on the Mayflower?

1410
01:06:55.734 --> 01:06:56.967
Waylon...

1411
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.133
you're a pompous blowhard.

1412
01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:00.700
Well. maybe.

1413
01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:03.000
But at least I'm not nuts.

1414
01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:05.767
Now. as I was saying.

1415
01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.667
this thresher here would've been
used by the local farmers

1416
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.100
to harvest their barley
and. uh. other grains.

1417
01:07:12.233 --> 01:07:13.767
I beg your pardon.

1418
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.433
Look.

1419
01:07:15.567 --> 01:07:18.567
It's the O.G.

1420
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.900
The crazy man himself.

1421
01:07:21.033 --> 01:07:23.333
Perhaps.

1422
01:07:23.467 --> 01:07:25.667
But what I find really crazy

1423
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.834
is how much this man is charging

1424
01:07:26.967 --> 01:07:29.533
for items for which
he is clearly misrepresenting.

1425
01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:31.333
Well. now. just a second here.

1426
01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:32.867
This device. for example.

1427
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.533
This was not used
for threshing grain.

1428
01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:37.266
It is a "flax break."

1429
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.734
If you will allow me--

1430
01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:42.266
you will notice...
this hole.

1431
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.367
There's a wooden peg
which is missing.

1432
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.567
on which this handle hinged.

1433
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.767
When the flax was harvested.

1434
01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.000
they would draw it
across these wooden slats

1435
01:07:52.133 --> 01:07:54.667
while bringing this handle
down repeatedly.

1436
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.100
It would break up
the fibers of the flax plants.

1437
01:07:58.233 --> 01:07:59.567
so they could be carded.

1438
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.166
and spun into thread.
then woven into linen.

1439
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.300
And that item
you are about to buy. madam.

1440
01:08:04.433 --> 01:08:06.667
that...

1441
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.967
is not a farming implement.
as he stated.

1442
01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.734
It is a child's toy...

1443
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.934
...and it is broken.

1444
01:08:17.567 --> 01:08:20.734
Uh. if you'll excuse me.
I can hear my phone ringing.

1445
01:08:20.867 --> 01:08:23.333
Hopefully it's someone who
knows what they're taking about.

1446
01:08:23.467 --> 01:08:24.333
You obviously don't.

1447
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.000
Oh! That was amazing!

1448
01:08:30.133 --> 01:08:33.066
I have never seen Waylon
so embarrassed.

1449
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.033
Oh...

1450
01:08:34.166 --> 01:08:36.433
I don't think
I needed that last cider.

1451
01:08:36.567 --> 01:08:38.300
Or the one before that.

1452
01:08:38.433 --> 01:08:40.567
- Oh. yeah.
- Let's get you to bed.

1453
01:08:42.266 --> 01:08:43.300
Mm.

1454
01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:45.166
"It's a flax break."

1455
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.166
"Oh. I think
I hear my phone ringing!"

1456
01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:50.633
Ahh...

1457
01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.266
You don't have to do that.

1458
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.433
I don't mind.

1459
01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:08.667
Your father...

1460
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.533
you're lucky to have him.

1461
01:09:19.133 --> 01:09:20.734
I should say goodnight.

1462
01:09:20.867 --> 01:09:22.667
Okay.

1463
01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:41.800
Rip!

1464
01:09:41.934 --> 01:09:43.867
Sarah?

1465
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.900
I'm a man
of old-fashioned principles.

1466
01:09:57.033 --> 01:09:58.000
I can't.

1467
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.667
Goodnight. Sarah.

1468
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.767
Goodnight.

1469
01:10:57.166 --> 01:10:58.367
Deputy.

1470
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.133
Can I come in?

1471
01:11:02.567 --> 01:11:04.500
Thanks.

1472
01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:09.200
Is everything all right?

1473
01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:11.233
Were you
expecting someone else?

1474
01:11:13.633 --> 01:11:16.033
It's a nice farm. isn't it?

1475
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.467
She's made a good life here.

1476
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.567
And the business...
it's taking off.

1477
01:11:25.734 --> 01:11:28.200
She's really made something
out of this place.

1478
01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:29.533
Yes. I have

1479
01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:32.166
a tremendous admiration
for Sarah

1480
01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.166
and her accomplishments.

1481
01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.367
Excuse me.

1482
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.467
I bet you do.

1483
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:40.467
So...

1484
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.500
I suppose
you're probably thinking

1485
01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:45.066
things are going
according to plan. huh?

1486
01:11:46.734 --> 01:11:49.300
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.

1487
01:11:49.433 --> 01:11:50.834
Look. uh...

1488
01:11:50.967 --> 01:11:53.200
it's just you and me here.

1489
01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:55.867
so can we drop
the whole innocent

1490
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.033
"I don't know anything
about anything" act

1491
01:11:58.166 --> 01:11:59.533
and just talk?

1492
01:12:00.834 --> 01:12:03.767
'Cause you know there's no way
I can let a con man like you

1493
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.767
take advantage
of good people like this. right?

1494
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.700
I assure you.

1495
01:12:07.834 --> 01:12:09.500
that is not
what I am doing here.

1496
01:12:09.633 --> 01:12:10.934
I have tried to behave

1497
01:12:11.066 --> 01:12:12.567
in only
the most honorable manner.

1498
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.100
- Honorable?
- Yes.

1499
01:12:16.233 --> 01:12:18.166
Interesting.

1500
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.433
Let me tell you
what I see.

1501
01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:24.667
You come along out of nowhere.

1502
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.433
acting innocent and confused
and helpless.

1503
01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:32.533
And somehow
you get them to go along

1504
01:12:32.667 --> 01:12:35.100
with your ridiculous stories

1505
01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:37.667
and maybe eventually
they feel sorry enough for you

1506
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.800
to keep you hanging around.

1507
01:12:41.467 --> 01:12:43.300
How am I doing so far?

1508
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.834
So now what?

1509
01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:47.700
Well...

1510
01:12:47.834 --> 01:12:50.433
please. enlighten me.

1511
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.033
Well. you're not really
gonna stick around.

1512
01:12:53.166 --> 01:12:55.233
We both know that.

1513
01:12:56.233 --> 01:12:58.000
No.

1514
01:12:58.133 --> 01:13:02.333
You fooled these people
into thinking you belong here.

1515
01:13:02.467 --> 01:13:04.734
But you do not.

1516
01:13:04.867 --> 01:13:06.233
And in the end.

1517
01:13:06.367 --> 01:13:09.734
all you're gonna do
is break their hearts.

1518
01:13:09.867 --> 01:13:11.166
I would never want that.

1519
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.100
Good.

1520
01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:17.300
I hope that's true.

1521
01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:21.900
Because I love that woman...

1522
01:13:22.033 --> 01:13:25.000
and I will not see her hurt.

1523
01:13:25.133 --> 01:13:28.633
I want to give her things
you never could.

1524
01:13:28.767 --> 01:13:31.633
I mean. what do you really
bring to the table?

1525
01:13:31.767 --> 01:13:35.133
Aside from silly stories
and zero prospects?

1526
01:13:35.266 --> 01:13:36.834
I think I have
something to offer

1527
01:13:36.967 --> 01:13:39.000
that men of this time
have long forgotten.

1528
01:13:41.533 --> 01:13:44.600
I gotta give it to you. man.

1529
01:13:44.734 --> 01:13:46.734
You are good with words.

1530
01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:48.834
I mean. this whole...
this whole thing--

1531
01:13:48.967 --> 01:13:51.633
it works.

1532
01:13:51.767 --> 01:13:53.633
But listen up. Rip.

1533
01:13:53.767 --> 01:13:58.300
If you truly love Sarah.
just do the right thing.

1534
01:13:58.433 --> 01:14:01.200
Your presence here
is doing damage

1535
01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:02.934
to her
and her entire family.

1536
01:14:05.033 --> 01:14:07.200
I can't even imagine
what you mean. I--

1537
01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:09.200
Well. that's the problem.
isn't it?

1538
01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.400
Because she's not
gonna tell you.

1539
01:14:11.533 --> 01:14:13.133
She's too kind.

1540
01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:15.967
Too good.

1541
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.734
But she is becoming a joke
in this town.

1542
01:14:18.867 --> 01:14:20.934
and I won't have it.

1543
01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:24.400
Her son is being bullied.

1544
01:14:24.533 --> 01:14:26.400
Her dad is being mocked.

1545
01:14:26.533 --> 01:14:29.033
All because they have
a guy living with them

1546
01:14:29.166 --> 01:14:31.233
who claims he knew
George Washington.

1547
01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:33.867
I know how it sounds.

1548
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.033
But it's the truth.

1549
01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:37.734
A real man
wouldn't do this. Rip...

1550
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.533
...even if
he is delusional enough

1551
01:14:45.667 --> 01:14:48.867
to think he fought
in the American Revolution.

1552
01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.734
I'm telling you right now

1553
01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:56.533
there is no future for you here.

1554
01:14:56.667 --> 01:14:58.900
And if you stay
a moment longer.

1555
01:14:59.033 --> 01:15:01.567
you might not have any future
left at all.

1556
01:15:03.033 --> 01:15:05.100
There's those words again.

1557
01:15:19.567 --> 01:15:20.533
...This is

1558
01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:22.700
your current traffic
and weather on the hour.

1559
01:15:22.834 --> 01:15:23.934
Sorry. folks.
but it's a real nasty...

1560
01:15:24.066 --> 01:15:24.967
Morning.

1561
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:27.300
Coffee's ready

1562
01:15:27.433 --> 01:15:30.266
and I'm about to go
fix some eggs.

1563
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.100
...Road closures
along the 202.

1564
01:15:33.233 --> 01:15:35.300
There's also a report
of a downed electrical line...

1565
01:15:35.433 --> 01:15:37.300
Good morning.

1566
01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:39.567
My tongue feels like
it's wearing a sweater.

1567
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.433
...Major precipitation
is expected throughout the day

1568
01:15:42.567 --> 01:15:43.967
and a travel advisory
has been issued

1569
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.233
along the entire
Hudson River Valley.

1570
01:15:47.367 --> 01:15:48.967
We're running
a little bit late this morning.

1571
01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.567
The storm temporarily
knocked out the power.

1572
01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:51.867
so my alarm didn't go off.

1573
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.100
Mom. do I have to go to school?

1574
01:15:53.233 --> 01:15:54.734
This is gonna be some storm!

1575
01:15:54.867 --> 01:15:56.767
Get your butt into gear.

1576
01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.300
All right. don't forget.

1577
01:15:58.433 --> 01:15:59.633
we have to batten down
the chicken coop

1578
01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:01.266
and check the latches
on the barn.

1579
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.767
...Find yourself a fire
and snuggle up with a good book.

1580
01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.834
or. if you're like me.
get caught up on some sleep.

1581
01:16:06.967 --> 01:16:08.433
This one has the potential
to develop into

1582
01:16:08.567 --> 01:16:09.767
one of the biggest
electrical storms

1583
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.100
we've seen in decades.

1584
01:16:16.567 --> 01:16:18.300
Hey!

1585
01:16:18.433 --> 01:16:21.200
I think I've almost gotten
everything in order.

1586
01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:23.700
Well. I brought you
a sandwich and some apple pie.

1587
01:16:23.834 --> 01:16:25.600
That's very...

1588
01:16:25.734 --> 01:16:26.967
you're very kind.

1589
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.100
It's the least I can do.

1590
01:16:28.233 --> 01:16:30.467
It's never the least with you.

1591
01:16:31.533 --> 01:16:33.433
Well. uh. Dad and I
are gonna run to the store.

1592
01:16:33.567 --> 01:16:34.767
just to pick up some things.

1593
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.300
in case we're stuck here
for the next few days

1594
01:16:36.433 --> 01:16:37.500
with this storm.

1595
01:16:37.633 --> 01:16:38.967
You'll be all right?

1596
01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:42.467
I hope so. Sarah Majors.

1597
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.867
I very much hope so.

1598
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500
Are you... Are y...
Are you okay?

1599
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.533
About last night?

1600
01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:55.867
You just seem--
You seem a little. um...

1601
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.533
No. last night was the most
wonderful moment of my life.

1602
01:17:03.567 --> 01:17:05.333
Good.

1603
01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.300
We should make sure

1604
01:17:20.433 --> 01:17:22.233
to put extra tie-downs
on the barn doors and shutters.

1605
01:17:22.367 --> 01:17:24.266
Yeah. Getting right on that.

1606
01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:33.200
I can't find Rip.

1607
01:17:33.333 --> 01:17:34.533
He's not in the orchard
or the barn.

1608
01:17:34.667 --> 01:17:36.200
You check the farmhouse?

1609
01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:38.100
Hey.

1610
01:17:38.233 --> 01:17:40.367
Hi. honey!
How was school?

1611
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.033
We practically
didn't do anything today.

1612
01:17:43.166 --> 01:17:45.033
I totally could've stayed home.

1613
01:17:45.166 --> 01:17:46.266
Oh. yeah? Why?

1614
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.633
I don't know. everyone was just
talking about the storm.

1615
01:17:48.767 --> 01:17:49.667
Sarah.

1616
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.500
It's from Rip.

1617
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.433
"My dearest Sarah.
Henry. and Calvin.

1618
01:18:02.567 --> 01:18:05.266
I must sincerely apologize
for my sudden de--"

1619
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.333
"...parture."

1620
01:18:07.467 --> 01:18:09.033
"I fear that if I were given--"

1621
01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:10.734
"...weeks or months.

1622
01:18:10.867 --> 01:18:12.367
and the world's
greatest volumes.

1623
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.600
I still would never find
the proper words

1624
01:18:14.734 --> 01:18:16.734
to express my gratitude

1625
01:18:16.867 --> 01:18:19.834
or convey
the depth of my feelings.

1626
01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:21.700
And thus I will depart.

1627
01:18:21.834 --> 01:18:23.433
much as I arrived--

1628
01:18:23.567 --> 01:18:26.200
with no fanfare or warning.

1629
01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:28.200
This storm seems like
my best chance

1630
01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:30.900
to return
to where I indeed belong.

1631
01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:34.100
I'm sure it will be
for the betterment of us all.

1632
01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:35.233
since I have no desire--"

1633
01:18:35.367 --> 01:18:36.533
"...to cause you
anymore distress."

1634
01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:38.367
"It is with a heavy heart

1635
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.433
and all of
my fondest affections

1636
01:18:40.567 --> 01:18:41.734
I bid you farewell.

1637
01:18:41.867 --> 01:18:44.600
Yours most truly
and always.

1638
01:18:44.734 --> 01:18:46.266
Rip."

1639
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.667
Why would he say that?

1640
01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.166
He's going back to the cave.

1641
01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.300
I have to stop him.

1642
01:18:50.433 --> 01:18:52.100
What if he does
get back to his time

1643
01:18:52.233 --> 01:18:53.667
and I don't even get
to say goodbye?

1644
01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.233
- I'll find him
- Where?

1645
01:18:55.367 --> 01:18:56.867
Up along the eastern ridge.
right?

1646
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.734
He said "Katterskill Point."
I think he meant Eagle Peak!

1647
01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.233
It's starting to get
really steep!

1648
01:19:36.367 --> 01:19:39.400
You go on.
We're just slowing you down!

1649
01:19:39.533 --> 01:19:40.900
Are you sure?

1650
01:19:41.033 --> 01:19:42.800
Yes. yes!
We'll be fine.

1651
01:19:42.934 --> 01:19:44.700
Go on!

1652
01:19:49.567 --> 01:19:52.266
Don't worry.
She'll find him.

1653
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.333
- Okay. Grandpa.
- Come on.

1654
01:20:14.934 --> 01:20:16.667
Rip!

1655
01:20:18.066 --> 01:20:19.266
Rip?

1656
01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:24.166
Rip!

1657
01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:27.000
Rip?

1658
01:20:28.467 --> 01:20:29.533
Sarah?

1659
01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.300
What are you doing
out here in this storm?

1660
01:20:33.433 --> 01:20:34.400
Are you mad?

1661
01:20:34.533 --> 01:20:35.400
You're the one
trying to go back

1662
01:20:35.533 --> 01:20:36.667
two and a half centuries
in time.

1663
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.934
and I'm the one who's crazy?

1664
01:20:39.066 --> 01:20:41.133
I left you a letter.

1665
01:20:41.266 --> 01:20:43.266
You said you were
causing us distress?

1666
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.066
What does that even mean?

1667
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.800
Ted enlightened me.

1668
01:20:47.934 --> 01:20:49.600
Ted?

1669
01:20:49.734 --> 01:20:52.300
What does Ted
have to do with this?

1670
01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:55.467
I'm ruining your reputation.
I have nothing to offer you.

1671
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.000
What-- I decide
what you have to offer me.

1672
01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:09.400
Well. now's the chance for you
to get back.

1673
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
Sarah...

1674
01:21:15.633 --> 01:21:19.200
I am a man who may forever be
out of the right time and place.

1675
01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.400
but I will
gladly forgo my chance

1676
01:21:21.533 --> 01:21:22.734
to return to where I belong.

1677
01:21:22.867 --> 01:21:26.033
if you would do me
the unimaginable honor

1678
01:21:26.166 --> 01:21:27.767
of giving me
your hand in marriage.

1679
01:21:31.133 --> 01:21:33.367
We don't have
to get married yet.

1680
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.567
But how about we go out
for a date or two?

1681
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:50.934
My pack! It's gone.

1682
01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:53.867
Come on.

1683
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.800
April 12th. 2022.

1684
01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:22.533
As I finally consider
the strange occurrences

1685
01:22:22.667 --> 01:22:24.600
which have befallen me.

1686
01:22:24.734 --> 01:22:26.066
I am loathe to admit

1687
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.266
I have spent the better part
of my life

1688
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.300
consumed with bitterness
towards my father.

1689
01:22:31.433 --> 01:22:34.700
Truthfully. through
no fault of my father's.

1690
01:22:34.834 --> 01:22:37.600
my life has been quite lonely.

1691
01:22:37.734 --> 01:22:40.734
I now deeply regret
such animosity.

1692
01:22:40.867 --> 01:22:44.367
However.
all of that has changed.

1693
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:48.033
The house I have always lived in
has finally become a home...

1694
01:22:48.166 --> 01:22:52.133
and it's only taken me
a few centuries to find it.

1695
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.867
I have discovered happiness
with a remarkable woman

1696
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.233
and her son
and her father.

1697
01:22:59.367 --> 01:23:01.467
They have opened my eyes
to true love.

1698
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.133
I only wish I could share
such a gift with my father.

1699
01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:07.967
I am not certain
where my future lies...

1700
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.767
or if I will ever
return to him.

1701
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.333
but I pray somehow

1702
01:23:12.467 --> 01:23:15.700
that he will know his son
does love him well.

1703
01:23:15.834 --> 01:23:17.500
I have learned
about such things

1704
01:23:17.633 --> 01:23:20.433
from a remarkable woman
who wears pants

1705
01:23:20.567 --> 01:23:21.533
and who gives me hope

1706
01:23:21.667 --> 01:23:24.767
that. in the future.
all things are possible.
