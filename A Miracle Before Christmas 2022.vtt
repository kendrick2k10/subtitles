360
00:18:55.827 --> 00:18:58.344
instead of building
your own company?

361
00:18:58.379 --> 00:18:59.758
There wouldn't be
a Mercedes Wright

362
00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:02.275
had I just sat around
and waited.

363
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.448
My girl.
She's saying it right.

364
00:19:04.482 --> 00:19:05.655
[Mercedes] That right?

365
00:19:05.689 --> 00:19:06.896
-Ha!
-[Faith] Hello.

366
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:08.862
[Mercedes] To that!

367
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.344
[crickets chirping]

368
00:19:13.379 --> 00:19:14.827
[dog barking]

369
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.448
It wasn't that bad.

370
00:19:17.482 --> 00:19:19.482
Wow. you serious?

371
00:19:19.517 --> 00:19:21.896
You know. I just wish you
could see yourself sometimes.

372
00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:23.689
We had guests over
for three hours.

373
00:19:23.724 --> 00:19:25.793
Nobody was able to say anything.

374
00:19:25.827 --> 00:19:28.655
That's ridiculous!
Everyone talked.

375
00:19:28.689 --> 00:19:30.310
[Matt] Okay.

376
00:19:30.344 --> 00:19:33.379
So what did Faith
and Caleb talk about?

377
00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:36.310
It's not my fault no one had
anything interesting to say.

378
00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:38.551
You know. I was
hoping that tonight

379
00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:41.310
would help us reconnect.

380
00:19:41.344 --> 00:19:42.827
especially after you
stood up your own daughter

381
00:19:42.862 --> 00:19:45.758
on her biggest day.

382
00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:48.344
I'm done defending you to them.

383
00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:51.344
Well. excuse me!

384
00:19:51.379 --> 00:19:53.241
Okay. look.

385
00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:56.827
I think you're being a
little dramatic about this.

386
00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.448
Look. I got tipsy.

387
00:19:59.482 --> 00:20:01.448
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:01.482 --> 00:20:04.517
But you're not
exactly Mr. Perfect.

389
00:20:04.551 --> 00:20:06.793
What are you talking about?

390
00:20:06.827 --> 00:20:10.206
This isn't about that.

391
00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:11.344
When was the last
time you thought about

392
00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:13.310
something more
important than yourself?

393
00:20:13.344 --> 00:20:14.689
Okay. stop it.

394
00:20:14.724 --> 00:20:16.448
You and the kids
are very important.

395
00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:17.758
Oh. really?

396
00:20:17.793 --> 00:20:19.448
So how about you explain to them

397
00:20:19.482 --> 00:20:21.517
why you never show up
to anything?

398
00:20:21.551 --> 00:20:23.689
Okay. wait a minute.
now. that's not fair.

399
00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:25.758
I never ask you to choose.

400
00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:28.862
All right. what's wrong with me
being a passionate career woman?

401
00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:30.965
And what's wrong with me
encouraging my husband

402
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.689
to become partner in a company.

403
00:20:32.724 --> 00:20:34.620
and which he
rightfully deserves?

404
00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:38.413
First off. they don't
offer partnerships. okay?

405
00:20:38.448 --> 00:20:40.793
Secondly. I love my job.

406
00:20:40.827 --> 00:20:44.241
I love being an architect.

407
00:20:44.275 --> 00:20:47.206
But I love our
family a lot more.

408
00:20:47.241 --> 00:20:48.965
I have no interest
in chasing something

409
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.586
that's going to take
me away from that.

410
00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.172
Blah. blah. blah. blah.

411
00:20:54.413 --> 00:20:57.689
Okay. humor me.

412
00:20:57.724 --> 00:21:02.310
Why do you have a driver when
you have a Mercedes out front?

413
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:05.241
Because I--
Don't do that.

414
00:21:08.758 --> 00:21:11.896
I miss the woman that I married.

415
00:21:11.931 --> 00:21:14.344
Mercedes Johnson.

416
00:21:18.034 --> 00:21:20.344
Did you know that Ashley
lost another tooth?

417
00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:24.862
You didn't tell me that.

418
00:21:24.896 --> 00:21:27.586
[Matt] Yes. I did.
A week ago.

419
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.689
Even told your parents.
You don't talk to them anymore.

420
00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:34.034
I just think we need some space.

421
00:21:34.068 --> 00:21:35.517
some time so that you
can have some clarity

422
00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:37.379
and figure out what's
important to you.

423
00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:42.310
So you're really leaving?

424
00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:45.862
You're your biggest fan.
You get you all to yourself.

425
00:21:45.896 --> 00:21:47.517
I'll be at my mom's
with the kids.

426
00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:49.931
Matthew!

427
00:21:55.896 --> 00:21:57.482
I think there's a
major difference

428
00:21:57.517 --> 00:21:59.689
in the way you
guys walked in here

429
00:21:59.724 --> 00:22:02.068
and the way you guys are
about to walk out of here.

430
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:03.758
We made some
progress today. guys.

431
00:22:03.793 --> 00:22:05.344
And I'm proud of us!

432
00:22:05.379 --> 00:22:07.482
Go make some babies!
What are we doing?

433
00:22:07.517 --> 00:22:10.586
We're wasting time here.
That's what I'm talking about!

434
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.000
Now we're all on the same page!
I'll see you guys next week.

435
00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:14.655
[Woman]
Okay. see you next week.

436
00:22:14.689 --> 00:22:16.379
All right! See you soon.

437
00:22:17.517 --> 00:22:18.965
Ah. yes!

438
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.827
Ooh. baby. call me Mrs. Fix It!

439
00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:22.965
You are so good. girl!

440
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.103
Yes. I know. I know.
you are so good.

441
00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:26.586
Woo-hoo!

442
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.068
[line trilling]

443
00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:35.000
[Martha] Hi. Mercedes.

444
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:40.000
[Martha] Well. he
took the kids to do

445
00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:44.551
and to see the Christmas
decorations downtown.

446
00:22:46.758 --> 00:22:49.758
That's not like him to
just leave his phone.

447
00:22:49.793 --> 00:22:52.448
[Martha] To be honest with you.
Mercedes. he knew you'd call.

448
00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:58.758
You can always come see the kids
whenever you want. Mercedes.

449
00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:05.034
while you figure
out what you want.

450
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:09.689
[Martha] I'll tell
him you called.

451
00:23:11.482 --> 00:23:13.758
[Martha] Mm. well--
[hang-up beep]

452
00:23:15.137 --> 00:23:17.965
Okay. I'll figure it out myself.

453
00:23:26.862 --> 00:23:28.965
I need a drink.

454
00:23:31.482 --> 00:23:32.965
[sighs]

455
00:23:35.758 --> 00:23:41.448
[hums to self]

456
00:23:50.482 --> 00:23:52.103
Cancel your Christmas Eve plans.

457
00:23:52.137 --> 00:23:53.827
I need you to organize
my financial statements

458
00:23:53.862 --> 00:23:55.517
for the past seven years.

459
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:58.034
But I told you
about my Christmas party.

460
00:23:58.068 --> 00:24:01.068
Go late.
I need them done by Christmas.

461
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.206
[door shuts]

462
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:14.620

was chopping logs nearby.

All right. kids. lights out.

Can we say our prayers?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.724
Yeah. can we?

479
00:25:14.758 --> 00:25:16.206
Of course.

for today. my family.

and the greatest
daddy in the world.

She doesn't know
yet. but she is.

God. please have your angels
watch over her and change her.

happy family again.

Amen.

00:25:44.689 --> 00:25:47.068
All right. it's time for bed.

Light's out for real
this time. okay?

-[Mercedes] Mm-hmm.

494

Rough night. huh?

495
00:25:58.068 --> 00:26:01.034
Thanks. Gary.
You have no idea.

496
00:26:01.068 --> 00:26:02.344
If I had a dime for every person

497
00:26:02.379 --> 00:26:05.000
I see like this
during the season...

498
00:26:05.034 --> 00:26:06.689
Mm-hmm.

499
00:26:06.724 --> 00:26:08.241
On the house.

500
00:26:10.931 --> 00:26:12.241
Merry Christmas.

501
00:26:14.862 --> 00:26:16.310
Merry Christmas.

00:26:17.413 --> 00:26:19.206
[sighs]

503
00:26:25.862 --> 00:26:27.344
Ah. sorry.

504
00:26:27.379 --> 00:26:29.896
I didn't see you there.

505
00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:32.206
Yeah.

506
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:34.655
The same thing
brought us both here.

507
00:26:34.689 --> 00:26:38.758
I'm sure your problems are
nothing compared to mine.

508
00:26:38.793 --> 00:26:42.241
What I've learned in life is
there's no problem so original

509
00:26:42.275 --> 00:26:44.344
that there's not
an answer to it.

510
00:26:44.379 --> 00:26:47.206
Hm. no advice I
can take from you.

511
00:26:50.724 --> 00:26:52.241
Okay.

512
00:26:55.103 --> 00:26:58.241
Imagine having an
ungrateful spouse.

513
00:26:59.379 --> 00:27:02.448
I gave that man the world.

514
00:27:02.482 --> 00:27:05.827
And one hiccup. and
that world is over.

515
00:27:18.793 --> 00:27:20.965
Let them sleep. baby.
They'll be fine.

516
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.758
You'll all be fine.

517
00:27:22.793 --> 00:27:24.275
Hey.

518
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.965
God works in mysterious ways.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.793
[gentle music]

520
00:27:34.862 --> 00:27:35.896
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:35.931 --> 00:27:38.448
I'm probably talking
your ear off.

522
00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:40.137
I didn't even get your name.

523
00:27:40.172 --> 00:27:43.413
-Oh. I'm David.
-Mercedes.

524
00:27:43.448 --> 00:27:45.344
-Nice to meet you.
-[Mercedes] Likewise.

525
00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:49.379
So. um...

526
00:27:49.413 --> 00:27:52.275
You find you have no
fault in any of this?

527
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.689
Honestly? No.

528
00:27:54.724 --> 00:27:56.103
Yes.

529
00:27:56.137 --> 00:27:58.241
Look. I'm ambitious.

530
00:27:58.275 --> 00:27:59.931
[David] [chuckles]

531
00:27:59.965 --> 00:28:01.965
And so is he!

532
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.206
And maybe I talk
too much sometimes.

533
00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:06.344
but that's what I do.

534
00:28:06.379 --> 00:28:08.448
I fix relationships.

535
00:28:08.482 --> 00:28:11.965
I am Mercedes Wright.

536
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.793
The chick from the projects who

That's a drag.
I've never seen you before.

719
00:39:06.551 --> 00:39:09.034
And I'm very good with faces.

720
00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:15.827
I do remember you as that
stuck-up executive bitch

721
00:39:15.862 --> 00:39:19.620
that was in the can earlier.

722
00:39:19.655 --> 00:39:21.448
I'm sorry?

723
00:39:21.482 --> 00:39:23.586
Sorry.

724
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.862
People talk. but I've
never seen you here before.

725
00:39:27.896 --> 00:39:31.448
You know. I'm not a big fan
of what they did around here.

726
00:39:31.482 --> 00:39:34.862
You could tell it
was a rush job.

727
00:39:34.896 --> 00:39:37.137
What brings you here tonight?

728
00:39:37.172 --> 00:39:40.172
This is obviously not
your type of hangout.

729
00:39:40.206 --> 00:39:42.724
I'm looking for my
ring and my wallet.

730
00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:47.137
I thought I might've left it
here when I was...here. earlier.

731
00:39:47.172 --> 00:39:49.620
Hey. what's going on with Gary?

732
00:39:49.655 --> 00:39:51.965
He's never this rude.

733
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
That prick is never nice.

734
00:39:54.034 --> 00:39:56.448
The less talking
he does. the better.

735
00:39:56.482 --> 00:39:58.827
It's obvious he hates his job.

736
00:39:58.862 --> 00:40:03.000
If you ask me. he's in
the wrong line of business.

737
00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:04.827
Well. good luck.

738
00:40:04.862 --> 00:40:08.000
I'll let the gang know to keep a
lookout if they find something.

739
00:40:08.034 --> 00:40:11.655
[mutters] Yeah. bet you will.

Well. screw you!

741

I'm only offering to help.

742
00:40:15.793 --> 00:40:18.068
Believe it or not. the people
in here are more trustworthy

743
00:40:18.103 --> 00:40:19.724
than you upscale pricks.

744
00:40:19.758 --> 00:40:21.000
Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry!

745
00:40:21.034 --> 00:40:23.172
Look. I...

746
00:40:23.206 --> 00:40:25.000
It's been a long day. all right?

747
00:40:25.034 --> 00:40:26.965
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:31.724 --> 00:40:33.034
What are you having?

750
00:40:33.068 --> 00:40:34.896
I'm tapped out with this.

751
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:36.896
I spent my last on it.

752
00:40:36.931 --> 00:40:37.931
It's Christmas. babe.

753
00:40:37.965 --> 00:40:39.551
It's on the house.

754
00:40:39.586 --> 00:40:42.137
Gary. another
round for the lady.

755
00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:48.172
Thanks.

756
00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:50.862
Look. I need you to
pay your tab tonight!

757
00:40:50.896 --> 00:40:53.172
Oh. shut up. Gary.
Have a heart!

758
00:40:53.206 --> 00:40:57.034
She lost her wallet.
I always pay my freakin' tab.

759
00:40:57.586 --> 00:41:00.206
Such a jerk. I tell you.

760
00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:02.206
Well. I need some
air and a cigarette.

761
00:41:02.241 --> 00:41:04.793
-You comin'?
-When did he get like this?

762
00:41:04.827 --> 00:41:07.034
Oh. just forget him.

763
00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:09.241
He's always like this.

764
00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:12.793
Candy.

765
00:41:12.827 --> 00:41:14.137
I need you to close
out your tab tonight.

766
00:41:14.172 --> 00:41:15.758
It ain't free. you know.

767
00:41:15.793 --> 00:41:17.586
Relax. Gary!

768
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.034
Jeez!

769
00:41:19.068 --> 00:41:22.068
Ugh! Jerk!

770
00:41:23.862 --> 00:41:26.206
Anyway...

771
00:41:26.241 --> 00:41:27.103
Right.

772
00:41:27.137 --> 00:41:28.965
[Candy] What part
of town you live?

773
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.931
Well. I thought I knew.
and then I ended up in jail.

774
00:41:32.965 --> 00:41:35.034
[Candy] Girl. your issue

775
00:41:35.068 --> 00:41:39.241
is more serious than I thought!

776
00:41:39.275 --> 00:41:42.172
You must be drinking that
new stuff they got here.

777
00:41:42.206 --> 00:41:46.620
Got people blackin' out
for days at a time. ugh.

778
00:41:48.068 --> 00:41:51.758
Well...I want you to be safe.

[Kenny] Where?

795
00:42:46.827 --> 00:42:48.896
[Kenny] Why are you at
that low-class place?

796
00:42:50.103 --> 00:42:51.137
I'm sending a car
to come get you.

797
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.034
East Hills?

798
00:42:58.068 --> 00:43:00.000
That's the richest part of town.

to live here with you.

00:51:00.689 --> 00:51:03.137
No. no. no. I got it.

898
00:51:04.448 --> 00:51:06.275
Um...

899
00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:09.034

Nine o'clock. you
have Ms. Dogmeyers.

906
00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:35.862
Ten o'clock. you
have the Wayans.

00:51:35.896 --> 00:51:38.413
Eleven o'clock. you
have Eleanor Murphy.

908
00:51:38.448 --> 00:51:39.689
Something's different.

909
00:51:39.724 --> 00:51:41.344
Good morning. Miss Johnson.

910
00:51:41.379 --> 00:51:43.206
She just lost her pet
rabbit last month.

911
00:51:43.241 --> 00:51:45.379
and this month. her poodle's
at the vet with a broken leg.

912
00:51:45.413 --> 00:51:46.620
so she's devastated--

913
00:51:46.655 --> 00:51:48.068
[Man] Good morning.
Miss. Johnson.

914
00:51:48.103 --> 00:51:49.206

world's falling apart.

A bunny?

916
00:51:50.655 --> 00:51:51.758
Whatever you do.
do not call it a bunny.

917
00:51:51.793 --> 00:51:53.551
It's Puffy Murphy.

918
00:51:53.586 --> 00:51:56.793
She looks at it as like
a family member or something.

919
00:51:56.827 --> 00:51:59.206
Then. at 12:00. you have
a noon luncheon to go over

the Black Money social
payment app possible merger

Woo-hoo!
If this goes through.

923
00:52:04.896 --> 00:52:07.344
we're looking at going
public in a year!

924
00:52:07.379 --> 00:52:08.517
Is that all?

925
00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:10.827
As usual. go over the rest
of your schedule at lunch.

926
00:52:10.862 --> 00:52:12.517

I just don't feel
valued anymore.

937
00:54:01.931 --> 00:54:03.517
This year. he thought
it was a good idea

938
00:54:03.551 --> 00:54:06.413
to fly the G5 instead of
the Global to visit my parents.

939
00:54:06.448 --> 00:54:10.310
Imagine that. the horror
of flying on a G5.

940
00:54:10.344 --> 00:54:12.689
Better yet. he thought
we should fly commercial

941
00:54:12.724 --> 00:54:14.310
during the holidays!

942
00:54:14.344 --> 00:54:17.034
Ugh. god only knows what
he'll get me for Christmas.

943
00:54:17.068 --> 00:54:19.344
Last year. I told him
exactly what I wanted.

944
00:54:19.379 --> 00:54:21.655
and somehow I ended up with
the ugliest emerald necklace

946

Let me tell you something.

950
00:54:29.758 --> 00:54:31.517
I logged in to his computer.

951
00:54:31.551 --> 00:54:33.862
He's secretly been trying
to buy a new Ferrari.

952
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:36.655

I sense a midlife crisis.

953
00:54:36.689 --> 00:54:38.241
I need to reschedule.

00:54:49.862 --> 00:54:50.896
Yes. I just need
to get some air.

You can't.
You're booked solid.

960

And you have that luncheon
in an hour and a half.

I'm sorry. Mercedes. but
today is not a good idea.

cancel on everybody.

sign up for this--

will never lose.

01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:54.206
Brian and I are so appreciative.

1076
01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:55.241
Uh. excuse me. ladies.

1077
01:02:55.275 --> 01:02:58.034
I'll. uh...I'll let you mingle.

1078
01:02:58.068 --> 01:03:02.068
[indistinct chatter]

1079
01:03:02.103 --> 01:03:04.137
Thank you so much
for bringing me over.

1080
01:03:04.172 --> 01:03:07.034
I won't let you down.

1081
01:03:07.068 --> 01:03:08.931
I know you won't.

1082
01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:10.448
We're all packed.

1083
01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:14.034
I'm so excited for our
honeymoon to Paris!

1084
01:03:14.068 --> 01:03:16.241
About that. I. um...

1085
01:03:16.275 --> 01:03:18.275
I need you to push that back.

1086
01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:19.931
It's not a good time.

1087
01:03:19.965 --> 01:03:22.000
I need you here.

1088
01:03:22.034 --> 01:03:24.413
Okay.

1089
01:03:24.448 --> 01:03:26.000
I'll let Brian know.

1090
01:03:26.034 --> 01:03:27.517
Good.

1091
01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:31.413
[indistinct chatter]

1092
01:03:34.206 --> 01:03:36.448
[laughter]

1093
01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:40.862
[indistinct chatter. laughter]

1094
01:03:51.413 --> 01:03:56.793
[melancholy music]

1095
01:04:29.413 --> 01:04:34.931
[gasps. sobs]

1096
01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:36.862
Oh no.

1097
01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:44.000
[music]

1098
01:04:50.068 --> 01:04:52.448
[sniffles. sighs]

1099
01:04:54.344 --> 01:04:56.620
[birds chirping]

1100
01:05:02.068 --> 01:05:05.551
Well...

1101
01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:08.137
I guess it's only
me and you now.

1102
01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.689
[dog whines]

1103
01:05:12.379 --> 01:05:14.482
[Mercedes] Thank you for letting
me barge in on you like this.

1104
01:05:14.517 --> 01:05:16.517
I know it was last minute.

1105
01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:18.206
Girl. it's no problem.

1106
01:05:18.241 --> 01:05:20.482
That's what friends are for.
[door opens]

1107
01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.586
Oh. one moment.
That's my son.

1108
01:05:26.206 --> 01:05:28.034
Hey. little man!

1109
01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:29.724
Mm!

1110
01:05:29.758 --> 01:05:31.000
Hi. Mom.

1111
01:05:31.034 --> 01:05:32.551
I have a surprise for you.

1112
01:05:32.586 --> 01:05:35.034
Oh. you've got him
spoiled. you know that?

1113
01:05:35.068 --> 01:05:37.034
Please. nothing else
before Christmas.

1114
01:05:37.068 --> 01:05:39.551
Aw. Mom. it's still
Christmas season.

1115
01:05:39.586 --> 01:05:42.379
RJ. it's in three days.

1116
01:05:42.413 --> 01:05:45.000
I packed him some extra clothes.

1117
01:05:45.034 --> 01:05:46.344
Thank you.

1118
01:05:46.379 --> 01:05:49.034
And I was thinking. um...

1119
01:05:49.068 --> 01:05:51.551
Maybe I could start
bringing him to school.

1120
01:05:51.586 --> 01:05:53.034
You know. he was
so upset last week.

1121
01:05:53.068 --> 01:05:55.551
And maybe it would
be a little bit--

1122
01:05:55.586 --> 01:05:59.448
Gina. I'm his mom.

1123
01:05:59.482 --> 01:06:02.413
I know. I know.

1124
01:06:02.448 --> 01:06:06.275
It was just a suggestion.

1125
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.620
Bye. Mom.
I love you.

1126
01:06:09.655 --> 01:06:13.103
Okay. babe.
See you later. okay?

1127
01:06:13.137 --> 01:06:15.379
Thank you.

1128
01:06:15.413 --> 01:06:18.517
Just...think about it.

1129
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:20.517
I will.

1130
01:06:20.551 --> 01:06:22.241
Okay.
Bye bye. sweetheart.

1131
01:06:22.275 --> 01:06:23.172
See you soon.

1132
01:06:23.206 --> 01:06:24.551
All right. you ready
for the surprise?

1133
01:06:24.586 --> 01:06:26.137
-[laughs]
-Let's go!

1134
01:06:31.448 --> 01:06:33.586
This is Mercedes.

1135
01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.068
Hi. nice to meet you.

1136
01:06:36.103 --> 01:06:37.448
How are you?

1137
01:06:37.482 --> 01:06:39.620
You're a handsome young man.

1138
01:06:39.655 --> 01:06:40.793
Are you hungry?

1139
01:06:40.827 --> 01:06:42.517
No. ma'am.
I already ate.

1140
01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:45.034
-Okay.
-Can I go play some Xbox?

1141
01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.344
Not for long.
You heard what Gina said.

1142
01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:50.206
And not until you're finished
with your reading assignment.

1143
01:06:50.241 --> 01:06:51.551
I hate reading.

1144
01:06:51.586 --> 01:06:54.344
Okay. okay. how about this?

1145
01:06:54.379 --> 01:06:57.448
Once I'm done here. I'll come
and we'll read it together.

1146
01:06:57.482 --> 01:06:59.206
Thanks.

1147
01:06:59.241 --> 01:07:00.379
Deal.

1148
01:07:00.413 --> 01:07:02.344
Okay. I'll see you later.

1149
01:07:02.379 --> 01:07:04.310
Bye.

1150
01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:06.379
He is something else.

1151
01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:08.137
He's adorable.

1152
01:07:08.172 --> 01:07:09.827
I put him through so
much. but thankfully.

1153
01:07:09.862 --> 01:07:11.620
he hardly remembers it.

1154
01:07:11.655 --> 01:07:14.241
He just knows he
has two mommies.

1155
01:07:14.275 --> 01:07:16.137
What happened?

1156
01:07:16.172 --> 01:07:17.758
[sighs]

1157
01:07:17.793 --> 01:07:21.206
I lost custody of him
when he was three.

1158
01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:25.482
I was in the streets--
drugs. living the fast life.

1159
01:07:25.517 --> 01:07:30.275
And one day. I woke up and
left him alone for two days.

1160
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:34.517
I tried to get clean after that.
but I couldn't forgive myself.

1161
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.655
I missed him so much.

1162
01:07:37.689 --> 01:07:42.620
Then I got the job at Morgan's.
and I finally got clean.

1163
01:07:42.655 --> 01:07:44.655
He's my world.

1164
01:07:44.689 --> 01:07:48.586
I just wanna be there for him.

1165
01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.379
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:07:50.413 --> 01:07:52.275
Girl. I'm strong.

1167
01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:54.689
It's one thing to
throw insults my way.

1168
01:07:54.724 --> 01:07:56.344
But I hate it when
they do it to him.

1169
01:07:56.379 --> 01:07:58.620
He's too sensitive.

1170
01:07:58.655 --> 01:08:00.379
He'll be tough. though.

1171
01:08:00.413 --> 01:08:01.413
He's just like his momma.

1172
01:08:01.448 --> 01:08:03.482
[chuckling]

1173
01:08:03.517 --> 01:08:05.448
But enough about me.

1174
01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:08.724
I know you didn't come
all this way for that.

1175
01:08:08.758 --> 01:08:10.517
Talk to me.

1176
01:08:10.551 --> 01:08:12.758
I'm worried about you.

1177
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:19.862
Well. I know this might
sound...crazy. but...

1178
01:08:21.793 --> 01:08:24.793
I'm living in an
alternate reality.

1179
01:08:26.758 --> 01:08:30.793
Like...what do you mean?

1180
01:08:30.827 --> 01:08:35.517
Just two days ago. I was
married with two kids.

1181
01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:37.793
My parents were alive.

1182
01:08:37.827 --> 01:08:43.689
And...yesterday. I woke up next
to a man I had never met before.

1183
01:08:43.724 --> 01:08:47.551
I have no kids.
no family. no life.

1184
01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:52.275
And I run the largest
company in the country.

1185
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:55.206
I have everything
anyone could ever want.

1186
01:08:55.241 --> 01:08:58.517
But at the same
time. I have nothing.

1187
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.172
I know I sound crazy.

1188
01:09:02.448 --> 01:09:04.965
Kind of. but girl.
in my line of business.

1189
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.827
I've heard stranger things.

1190
01:09:07.862 --> 01:09:10.689
Were you at any
parties recently?

1191
01:09:10.724 --> 01:09:12.172
Maybe you were drugged.

1192
01:09:14.034 --> 01:09:19.344
This is gonna sound
ridiculous. but...

1193
01:09:19.379 --> 01:09:21.310
I made a wish.

1194
01:09:21.344 --> 01:09:22.448
A wish?

1195
01:09:22.482 --> 01:09:24.965
Yeah.

1196
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.758
I didn't think it would
come true. but it did.

1197
01:09:27.793 --> 01:09:31.379
And now I'm living
in her reality.

1198
01:09:31.413 --> 01:09:32.724
Whose reality?

1199
01:09:32.758 --> 01:09:35.517
Mercedes.

1200
01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:37.655
Aren't you Mercedes?

1201
01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:40.827
Yeah. kind of.
but it's just--

1202
01:09:40.862 --> 01:09:43.724
You know what. girl?
I'm here for you.

1203
01:09:43.758 --> 01:09:45.896
Whatever you need.

1204
01:09:45.931 --> 01:09:49.620
Thank you.
Oh my god...

1205
01:09:49.655 --> 01:09:56.827
[melancholy music]

1206
01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.793
[alarm buzzing]

1207
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:19.827
The grieving process
is never easy.

1208
01:10:19.862 --> 01:10:22.448
It's one day at a time.

1209
01:10:22.482 --> 01:10:26.586
And don't let anyone put
a timetable on your grief.

1210
01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.413
Okay?

1211
01:10:28.448 --> 01:10:29.862
Now. continue.

1212
01:10:29.896 --> 01:10:33.275
I wanna hear more
about this dream.

1213
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:38.655
Well. I was back home.
in Fort Worth.

1214
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:42.896
And. uh. Wolf and Francis
and I would pick berries

1215
01:10:42.931 --> 01:10:44.931
in our back pasture.

1216
01:10:44.965 --> 01:10:48.689
And while back
there. I saw Puffy.

1217
01:10:48.724 --> 01:10:51.275
just sitting there.
staring at me.

1218
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.310
And I run up to him.
and I was saying.

1219
01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:58.689
"Puffy. it's me! It's Mommy!
Don't you recognize me?"

1220
01:10:58.724 --> 01:11:00.827
He was just keep backing up.

1221
01:11:00.862 --> 01:11:03.034
like he didn't even
know who I was!

1222
01:11:03.068 --> 01:11:05.034
And I was running after him.

1223
01:11:05.068 --> 01:11:09.000
and I was crying and
calling after him. and...

1224
01:11:09.034 --> 01:11:11.655
"Puffy. it's me! It's Mommy!"

1225
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:13.000
[breaks down sobbing]

1226
01:11:13.034 --> 01:11:14.655
Just--you know what?

1227
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:18.931
[loud argument outside]

1228
01:11:22.448 --> 01:11:24.758
Uh. can we take five?
Uh. let me--

1229
01:11:24.793 --> 01:11:25.965
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1230
01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:31.862
Girl. what's wrong with you?

1231
01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:42.379
What has gotten into you?
You can't be seen with her.

1232
01:11:42.413 --> 01:11:45.034
It's bad for the
Mercedes Johnson brand.

1233
01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:47.724
We have a huge network
TV interview in two days

1234
01:11:47.758 --> 01:11:50.724
all about this merger. okay?

1235
01:11:50.758 --> 01:11:52.034
-You chose Christmas Eve.
-I know.

1236
01:11:52.068 --> 01:11:53.931
[Rachel]
You hired me for a reason.

1237
01:11:53.965 --> 01:11:57.482
Now. I'm telling you
this needs to stop now.

1238
01:11:57.517 --> 01:11:59.724
Sitting in your office is one
of our highest-paying clients.

1239
01:11:59.758 --> 01:12:02.758
I do not need to tell you that
she owns half of this town.

1240
01:12:02.793 --> 01:12:04.448
Your friend is embarrassing us.

1241
01:12:04.482 --> 01:12:06.551
Rachel. I know.

1242
01:12:06.586 --> 01:12:09.551
Just give me a
couple minutes. okay?

1243
01:12:09.586 --> 01:12:11.000
Five.

1244
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.379
Girl. I was--

1245
01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:15.827
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1246
01:12:15.862 --> 01:12:18.034
Listen. this is
my business. okay?

1247
01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:21.586
And everybody might
not understand.

1248
01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.931
Well. I'm sorry.

1249
01:12:22.965 --> 01:12:24.862
