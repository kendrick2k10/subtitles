You’re right.

718
01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:59.545
Christa Peterson couldn’t
attract Jeremy’s eye

719
01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:02.757
if she were standing naked.
holding an original manuscript

720
01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.091
of The Decameron
and a case of beer.

721
01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:13.434
Well. when I explained
my situation to Gabriel.

722
01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:17.688
he volunteered to take over
for me while I was away.

723
01:04:17.772 --> 01:04:19.493
It turned out.
I was away for four months.

724
01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.274
I didn’t know that.

725
01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:24.944
I never explained to Gabriel
why it was so important

726
01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.363
for me to see John
before he died.

727
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.244
I don’t see a reason to
keep this a secret anymore.

728
01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:36.832
I don’t expect you to hide
things from your husband.

729
01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:39.460
but I would ask that
you be discreet.

730
01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:41.252
Of course. Professor.

731
01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:45.549
Old Hut. who was married. and I

732
01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:48.803
were involved
while I was his student.

733
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.679
No one found out about us.

734
01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:53.181
but there were rumors and
they followed me for ten years.

735
01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:55.391
Someone wrote to the University
of Cambridge.

736
01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:57.310
claiming that the only
reason Old Hut

737
01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.954
wrote me a letter
of recommendation for me

738
01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:00.707
was simply because
I was sleeping with him.

739
01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.065
[laughs]

740
01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.734
I’m so sorry.
That isn’t funny.

741
01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:05.486
Of course it’s funny.

742
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:08.196
You should have seen the letter
of recommendation he wrote.

743
01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:12.075
"Miss Picton is competent
in the study of Dante."

744
01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.453
I was his lover. for God’s sake.

745
01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:16.329
You think he could
trouble himself

746
01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:17.790
to write more than one sentence?

747
01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:24.170
When you have your
faculty position.

748
01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.339
all these rumors
will be forgotten.

749
01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:29.968
That’s six years away.
Professor.

750
01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:32.303
Considering all that
I’ve shared with you.

751
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.180
I think you could
call me Katherine.

752
01:05:36.809 --> 01:05:39.144
Thank you. Katherine.

753
01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:42.355
You need to be more
assertive. academically.

754
01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:47.360
Don’t let yourself be ravaged by
wolves like some diseased moose.

755
01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.921
You mustn’t let your
husband defend you.

756
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.047
It makes you look helpless.

757
01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:52.491
Chivalry in academia is dead.

758
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.335
[chamber music playing]

759
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.549
Dessert?

760
01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.677
Excuse me.

761
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.970
Ladies’ Room.

762
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.352
She needs rest.

763
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:23.313
The poor girl is worn out.

764
01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.858
Yes.

765
01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:28.193
You cannot be
Julianne’s champion

766
01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:31.112
at academic conferences.

767
01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:34.199
Let her brightness shine.

768
01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.743
That’s all I want.

769
01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:37.493
Good.

770
01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:42.833
Now. I hope when I give my
lecture in January at Harvard

771
01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:45.878
I’ll be invited
to your home for dinner.

772
01:06:45.961 --> 01:06:48.379
Greg Matthews always
takes me to these

773
01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:51.926
appalling molecular
gastronomy restaurants

774
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:56.972
that serve deconstructed entrées
cooked in liquid nitrogen.

775
01:06:57.055 --> 01:06:59.307
I never know
whether I’m having dinner

776
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.477
or sitting for an exam
in organic chemistry.

777
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:03.561
[chuckles]

778
01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:09.735

[sighs]

782
01:07:44.687 --> 01:07:46.814
I need the room tomorrow night.

783
01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.235
I’ll be entertaining.

784
01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.824
[music stops]

785
01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:59.284
You’d take someone
to your bed so soon?

786
01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.999
The sheets will still be warm.

787
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.835
Don’t judge me.
You’re married.

788
01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:10.211
Who I fuck is
none of your business.

789
01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.810
Such a dirty mouth. Cristina.

790
01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.909
I wondered why you
insisted I bring you.

791
01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:45.039
You’re here for revenge.

792
01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.248
We’re both getting
what we wanted.

793
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.420
Be careful. Cristina.

794
01:08:52.503 --> 01:08:55.465
You don’t want
Professor Picton as an enemy.

795
01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.010
I don’t care.

796
01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.094
Fuck!

797
01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:04.099
Don’t you understand
the patronage system?

798
01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:08.103
Departments around the world
are filled with her admirers.

799
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:11.522
Your chair at Columbia
was her student.

800
01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:13.817
Too late.
I’ve already pissed her off.

801
01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:20.406
I’m responsible for you.
so you will stop.

802
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.409
I’m trying to get a position
in America.

803
01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.621
I don’t need Professor
Picton making trouble.

804
01:09:26.705 --> 01:09:30.375
Fine. but I need
the room tomorrow.

805
01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:38.341
So. who is the man
you fuck tomorrow?

806
01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:41.970
A priest?
A professor?

807
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.974
Who said it was a man?

808
01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:49.560
Then I expect you to share.

809
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.306
Wake up. darling.

810
01:10:29.852 --> 01:10:31.145
You need to get ready.

811
01:10:33.856 --> 01:10:35.440
You kept me up late.

812
01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:36.859
[yawns]

813
01:10:41.989 --> 01:10:43.239
[sniffs]

814
01:10:50.956 --> 01:10:52.707
Mmm.

815
01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.042
You smell of sex...

816
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.129
And me.

817
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.717
You can’t deliver a lecture
at Oxford smelling of sex.

818
01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.054
Watch me.

819
01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:17.816
[laughs]

820
01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:45.052
You look lovely.

821
01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.887
And you’re going to be fine.

822
01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.072
I’m going to get a coffee.
What would you like?

823
01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:06.489
Water.

824
01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:07.572
See you in there.

825
01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:17.000
[Christa]
Hello. Professor.

826
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.220
What do you want?

827
01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:29.554
You wanted to talk.

828
01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:30.637
So... Talk.

829
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:36.270
I want the slander
to stop or I’ll sue you.

830
01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.437
For what?
Telling the truth?

831
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.275
There’s no truth to your
character assassinations.

832
01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.585
You’re forgetting the part where
you fucked one of your students

833
01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:46.071
and were placed on
administrative leave.

834
01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:48.282
Not to mention Professor Singer

835
01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:49.950
had quite a bit
to say about you.

836
01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:53.996
You’re playing with fire.

837
01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:56.248
Oh. I hope so. Professor.

838
01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.916
You keep your mouth shut.

839
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.086
Or I’ll make your life
a living hell.

840
01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:03.629
The power to end this
is in your hands.

841
01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.091
Actually. it’s a bit lower.

842
01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:09.802
For fuck’s sake.

843
01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.181
Come to my hotel and tomorrow.

844
01:13:13.265 --> 01:13:15.808
you won’t have to worry about
my talented mouth anymore.

845
01:13:17.019 --> 01:13:18.644
I know you.

846
01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:22.274
I know what you like and
I know what you want.

847
01:13:22.357 --> 01:13:24.442
No.

848
01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:27.653
Then what happens next
is on your conscience.

849
01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:31.116
You stay away from my wife.
do you hear me?

850
01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.744
I’m at the Malmaison.

851
01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.704
I brought handcuffs...

852
01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.999
Come before midnight.

853
01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.794
Give my best to your wife.

854
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.194
It’s so good to see you.

855
01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:18.537
[whispers]
Angelfucker.

856
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.091
Professor Emerson.

857

Paul.

858
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.842
Shake hands. gentlemen.

859
01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.118
I didn’t know you were coming.

860
01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.685
I wasn’t.

861
01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:41.912
One of the presenters
backed down.

862
01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.688
so Professor Picton invited me.

863
01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.856
I’m giving the paper
just before Julia’s.

864
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.526
That’s great.
Congratulations.

865
01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:49.860
Can I take you to lunch?

866
01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.197
I’m afraid
she already has plans.

867
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.366
I’d love to go
to lunch with you. Thank you.

868
01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:56.410
Hello. Mr. Norris.

869
01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.372
Mr. Norris and I are having
dinner this evening.

870
01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:02.665
I’d like for you and
Julianne to join us.

871
01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.292
We’d be delighted.

872
01:15:04.376 --> 01:15:07.421
Since we’ll be dining with
you this evening.

873
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.588
I’ll claim my wife for lunch.

874
01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.006
Very well.

875
01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:15.761
I want to go to lunch with him.

876
01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.930
Over my dead body.

877
01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.765
He wants you.

878
01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:22.330
Paul is not someone who would
make a pass at a married woman.

[sighs]

880
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.898
This conference is like a tour

881
01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:29.650
through the various
levels of Hell.

882
01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.028
It’s just lunch.

883
01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.011
Good afternoon.

884
01:15:57.095 --> 01:16:01.682
Why Ugolino’s feast
will never end.

885
01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:05.312
The bestial nature of
Ugolino is dramatically depicted

886
01:16:05.395 --> 01:16:09.857
in Auguste Rodin’s sculpture.
"Ugolino and His Children."

887
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:13.153
This piece forms piece
of Rodin’s larger work.

888
01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:16.323
The Gates of Hell
and has a prominent position

889
01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:18.241
in that commission.

890
01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:21.495
Rodin sculpts Ugolino
as he crawls

891
01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.247
over the figures of
his dying children.

892
01:16:24.331 --> 01:16:28.251
His form both animalistic
and grotesque.

893
01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:32.004
But Rodin has captured
Ugolino just before...

895
01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.672
How’s your dad?

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:16.383
He’s better.

897
01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:17.467
Thanks for the flowers.

898
01:17:19.344 --> 01:17:20.845
[chuckles]

899
01:17:27.352 --> 01:17:29.312
I heard about Julia’s wedding.

900
01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:32.566
Your mom told my mom.

901
01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.901
She’s clearly a fool.

902
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.615
Uh... She isn’t. but thanks.

903
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.860
Do you want to go to a movie?

904
01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:50.666
I mean. sometime.
Not right now.

905
01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:53.043
It’s too early to go
to a movie right now.

906
01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:54.212
I don’t know.

907
01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:58.592
I don’t want things
to be weird between us.

908
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.843
We always promised each other
we’d be friends.

909
01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:07.350
Things are just...
difficult right now.

910
01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:15.442
Look. I’m not trying to rope
you into something.

911
01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.277
I really want to be friends.

912
01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:22.947
Hey.

913
01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.117
Relax.

914
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.121
We have a history. Allison.

915
01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:31.583
And it’s a good one.

916
01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:33.460
But I don’t want to
jump back into

917
01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:34.743
something with you right now.

918
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.755
You deserve to be with someone

919
01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:41.468
who’s serious and
not half in it.

920
01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:53.020
So. are we on
for that movie sometime?

921
01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:56.441
I might even take you to dinner.

922
01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:58.604
now that I’m pulling in
the big bucks as a teacher.

923
01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:04.073
Only if I can take you
to breakfast right now.

924
01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:07.577
[chuckles]

925
01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.133
Should we wait here?

926
01:19:28.348 --> 01:19:30.433
Excuse me. I have to use
the bathroom.

927
01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:53.789
I can’t wait to hear your paper.

928
01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.667
I’m sure I’ll have
a few questions.

929
01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.003
Your vendetta is ridiculous.

930
01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:01.548
I never did anything to you.

931
01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:07.177
You have something I want
and I always get what I want.

932
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.639
I don’t understand
what he sees in you.

933
01:20:09.723 --> 01:20:12.726
Gabriel is beautiful.
He’s a legend.

934
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:16.020
All the women at Lobby
knew him and wanted to fuck him.

935
01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.824
He needs to be with
a woman whose appetite

936
01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:19.649
is as voracious as his.

937
01:20:19.733 --> 01:20:20.816
He is.

938
01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:22.317
Hardly.

939
01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:24.446
I’m sure he enjoyed
the conquest.

940
01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:26.656
but now his eyes will wander.

941
01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.366
He’s probably cheated already.

942
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.830
Love.

943
01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.000
What?

944
01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.627
What Gabriel sees in me.

945
01:20:39.711 --> 01:20:41.379
The answer is love.

946
01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:43.213
I know about the other women.

947
01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:44.840
They aren’t a threat.

948
01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:46.384
You’re delusional.

949
01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:48.069
Why would he want
a vanilla little mouse

950
01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.804
when he could have
a tiger in his bed?

951
01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:53.767
Better a loving mouse
than an indifferent tiger.

952
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.310
Those women didn’t see
who he truly is.

953
01:20:56.394 --> 01:20:58.521
They didn’t care
that he was miserable.

954
01:20:58.605 --> 01:21:00.815
They would have used him
until there was nothing left

955
01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:03.485
and then thrown him away.

956
01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:05.944
I have loved him since
I was seventeen.

957
01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:08.782
I love all of him.
the light and the dark.

958
01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:09.907
That is why he’s with me.

959
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.743
So do your worst. Christa.

960
01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:15.789
But if you’re planning to seduce
my husband. you will fail.

961
01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.419
You’re right about
one thing. though.

962
01:21:21.503 --> 01:21:23.588
My husband is an
exceptional lover.

963
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:25.005
Absolutely mind-blowing.

964
01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.509
And tonight and every night.

965
01:21:27.592 --> 01:21:30.928
the woman enjoying his
adventurous nature will be me.

966
01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:33.723
Not bad for a mouse.

967
01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.208
You look good.

968
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.753
Much better than
the last time I saw you.

969
01:22:03.837 --> 01:22:05.630
Married life agrees with me.

970
01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:09.925
You all right?

971
01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:12.595
I’ve just noticed
the Rabbit’s gone.

972
01:22:12.679 --> 01:22:14.388
About time. don’t you think?

973
01:22:14.472 --> 01:22:15.807
I’ll miss her.

974
01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:37.620
I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.

975
01:22:37.704 --> 01:22:39.121
Sorry.

976
01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:42.500
Table for two by the window?

977
01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:45.043
Maybe we could trade
tables with the little girl?

978
01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:47.004
She might like
to look out the window.

979
01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:58.307
Thank you.

980
01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.243
Maia. we can sit by the window.
Isn’t that nice?

981
01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.603
We can look at the pumps.

982
01:23:01.686 --> 01:23:02.686
Come on.

983
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:07.983
Thank you.

984
01:23:19.787 --> 01:23:22.540
Are you planning on having a
Maia of your own anytime soon?

985
01:23:22.624 --> 01:23:23.917
No.

986
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:27.127
Um. not yet. I mean...

987
01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:30.088
Do you want to share?

988
01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:33.593
Sure. the lunch special and
appetizer platter look good.

989
01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:38.890
Tired?

990
01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:40.390
A little.

991
01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:42.100
My eyes bother me sometimes.

992
01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.544
You should get your eyes
checked.

993
01:23:43.603 --> 01:23:45.563
Lots of grad students end up
with eyestrain.

994
01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:46.940
Do you wear glasses?

995
01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:50.192
No. I drank a lot
of milk growing up.

996
01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.276
It helps vision.

997
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.655
I thought carrots did that.

998
01:23:53.738 --> 01:23:55.113
Milk helps everything.

999
01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.662
Are you seeing anyone?

1000
01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:06.291
Ali and I go out occasionally.
but it’s casual.

1001
01:24:07.627 --> 01:24:08.628
She’s nice.

1002
01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.839
She cares about you.

1003
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.550
I want you to be happy.

1004
01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:17.155
How are things going
in your program?

1005
01:24:19.806 --> 01:24:21.975
The professors are tough.

1006
01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:25.979
I’m working all the time.
but I love it.

1007
01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.063
Do you go out at all?

1008
01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:30.024
Rarely.

1009
01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:33.568
It’s awkward because the other
students invite their partners

1010
01:24:33.653 --> 01:24:36.698
and Gabriel doesn’t think
it’s a good idea for him

1011
01:24:36.781 --> 01:24:38.658
to socialize with grad students.

1012
01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:44.998
He wants to have a baby.

1013
01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:50.711
And you don’t?

1014
01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.462
I want to finish my program.

1015
01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.315
I’m worried if we have a baby.
I’ll never graduate.

1016
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:55.842
Have you told him?

1017
01:24:55.925 --> 01:24:57.384
Yes.

1018
01:24:57.467 --> 01:24:59.344
He said he understood.

1019
01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.179
But once you express
that kind of desire.

1020
01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.890
it can’t be taken back.

1021
01:25:02.974 --> 01:25:05.810
Jules. if you aren’t ready
for a family. say so.

1022
01:25:05.893 --> 01:25:07.687
Otherwise. you’re gonna
end up miserable.

1023
01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:11.148
I don’t think having
a baby with my husband

1024
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.607
would make me miserable.

1025
01:25:12.692 --> 01:25:13.932
Dropping out of Harvard would.

1026
01:25:19.657 --> 01:25:22.326
If your husband loves you. then
he needs to wake the fuck up

1027
01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.536
and drop the whole
barefoot-and-pregnant bullshit.

1028
01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.619
He doesn’t want that.

1029
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:30.542
I’m not the only person
whose dreams count.

1030
01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:35.715
It’s hard for me
to see you with him.

1031
01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:38.158
When is he going to realize
he married an incredible woman

1032
01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:39.360
and that he needs
to care for her?

1033
01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:41.971
He does care for me.

1034
01:25:42.055 --> 01:25:45.892
He’d give me the world if
he could fit it in his pocket.

1035
01:25:45.975 --> 01:25:48.936
I’m the one who’s struggling.

1036
01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.914
It’s hard to withhold something
from someone you love.

1037
01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:53.482
knowing it would make him happy.

1038
01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.401
And I’m happy. Paul.

1039
01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:57.904
Truly.

1040
01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:05.494
Bon apetit.

1041
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.083
She is a rising star at Harvard.

1042
01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.335
Please welcome Julianne Emerson.

1043
01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.088
[applause]

1044
01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.561
Thank you. Professor Patel.

1045
01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:38.402
The title of my presentation is

1046
01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:42.782
"The Silence of St. Francis:
A Witness to Fraud."

1047
01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:45.450
In canto 27 of Dante’s Inferno.

1048
01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:48.286
Guido da Montefeltro
tells the story

1049
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.622
of what happened after he died.

1050
01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:55.128
"Francis came afterward.
when I was dead. for me;

1051
01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.671
"but one of the black
Cherubim said to him:

1052
01:26:57.755 --> 01:27:00.800
"’Take him not; do me no wrong;

1053
01:27:00.883 --> 01:27:03.635
"he must come down among
my servitors.

1054
01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.888
Because he gave
the fraudulent advice."

1055
01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:13.980
Guido sought absolution for
the sin of fraudulent counsel

1056
01:27:14.063 --> 01:27:16.606
before he committed the sin.

1057
01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:19.276
He believed absolution
would free him

1058
01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:22.404
from the consequences
of his sin.

1059
01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.281
Francis could have
called him a liar

1060
01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:27.201
for presenting a false
account of his appearance.

1061
01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:30.245
Instead of fighting
to preserve his good name.

1062
01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:34.374
Francis is quiet so the evil
can be heard

1063
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.003
for exactly what it is.

1064
01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.635
Guido would have us believe

1065
01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:49.056
that Francis confronted
a demon but lost.

1066
01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:51.142
because he wasn’t
smart enough to best the demon

1067
01:27:51.225 --> 01:27:52.935
in a match of logic.

1068
01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:57.231
In my view. he comes to the
grave of Guido da Montefeltro

1069
01:27:57.314 --> 01:28:02.028
to mourn him and his life
of fraud. not to rescue him.

1070
01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:05.823
In conclusion. Francis
appeared at the death of Guido.

1071
01:28:05.907 --> 01:28:08.242
but not to steal his soul.

1072
01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:13.247
If anything.
Dante uses Guido as a foil

1073
01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:15.582
to praise the piety of
St. Francis

1074
01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:19.628
by providing a stark contrast
between the two men.

1075
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.005
Thank you.

1077
01:28:30.181 --> 01:28:31.681
Thank you.

1078
01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:33.184
Are there any questions?

1079
01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:37.604
I have a question.

1080
01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:46.255
There are so many holes
in your paper.

1081
01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:48.282
I don’t even know
where to begin.

1082
01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:51.785
But let’s start
with your research.

1083
01:28:51.869 --> 01:28:55.539
The majority of papers accept
that Francis came for Guido.

1084
01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:58.042
A few deny that
Francis appeared.

1085
01:28:58.125 --> 01:29:01.254
But no one. no one.

1086
01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:05.049
believes that Francis appeared
but not for Guido’s soul.

1087
01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:07.551
Either Guido’s lying
or he isn’t.

1088
01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:11.013
It can’t be half and half.
like cream.

1089
01:29:13.307 --> 01:29:15.725
You didn’t even mention
Canto 27.

1090
01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:19.313
where Guido explains to Dante
that he’s telling the truth.

1091
01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:21.523
If you had bothered to
read Professor Hutton’s

1092
01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:24.442
seminal work on the
organization of the Inferno.

1093
01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:27.029
you’d know he thought
the demon’s speech was reliable

1094
01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:30.116
because his words were
historically accurate.

1095
01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:33.743
So Hutton thought that Francis
appeared for Guido’s soul. too.

1096
01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:00.354
Guido says he’s willing
to tell the truth

1097
01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:03.274
because he believes Dante
is one of the damned

1098
01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:05.943
and thus won’t be able
to repeat the story.

1099
01:30:06.027 --> 01:30:08.237
But Guido’s tale
is self-serving.

1100
01:30:08.321 --> 01:30:10.739
He simply doesn’t want to
tip his hand by saying so.

1101
01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:12.616
which is why he
gives the speech.

1102
01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:15.744
You’re forgetting this
line: "Ora chi se.

1103
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.579
"ti priego che ne conte;

1104
01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:19.664
"non esser duro più
ch’altri sia stato.

1105
01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:24.211
se ’l nome tuo nel
mondo tegna fronte."

1106
01:30:24.295 --> 01:30:28.299
Dante tells Guido he intends
to repeat his tale in the world.

1107
01:30:28.382 --> 01:30:30.968
It’s only after Dante says this

1108
01:30:31.052 --> 01:30:32.594
that Guido
recounts his life story.

1109
01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.846
Also. we know that Dante
doesn’t resemble

1110
01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.265
the other shades physically.

1111
01:30:36.349 --> 01:30:38.767
So it is likely that
Guido recognized

1112
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.062
that Dante wasn’t dead.

1113
01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:42.604
I think...

1114
01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.207
As for your point about
Professor Hutton’s work.

1115
01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:46.359
your characterization of
his position is incorrect.

1116
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.778
In a footnote he states that
he believed Francis appeared

1117
01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:51.422
because he thinks the words
of the demon

1118
01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:54.408
were directed at someone
other than Guido himself.

1119
01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:56.785
Professor Hutton says he
has doubts

1120
01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:59.205
as to whether Francis
appeared for Guido’s soul

1121
01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:00.914
or for some other reason.

1122
01:31:00.998 --> 01:31:03.084
- But...
- Can we move on?

1123
01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:06.170
You’ve asked your question
and the speaker answered it.

1124
01:31:06.253 --> 01:31:09.923
Adequately. I might add.

1125
01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:12.509
I tend to agree with much
of what you’ve said.

1126
01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.387
and although I can’t
speak for him.

1127
01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:18.807
I surmise Old Hut
would too. if he were here.

1128
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.102
Thank you. Professor Wodehouse.

1129
01:31:21.185 --> 01:31:23.770
However. you rather
glossed over the agreement

1130
01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:27.400
that existed between
Boniface and Guido.

1131
01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.776
My thesis was on
the interpretation

1132
01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:32.821
of Francis’s appearance.
not Guido’s sin.

1133
01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:35.157
Nevertheless.
I’m happy to expand

1134
01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:37.284
on that part of the paper.

1135
01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:40.662

Pope Boniface VIII...

Fuck it.

1146
01:33:53.254 --> 01:33:55.046
Professor Picton would
like you to be

1147
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.690
an external reader on
my dissertation.

1148
01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:00.553
Is that something
you’d consider?

1149
01:34:03.096 --> 01:34:04.557
I’ll consider it.

1150
01:34:07.393 --> 01:34:08.744
I was at UCLA and people
were talking about

1151
01:34:08.768 --> 01:34:10.455
how Julia boinked you in
order to graduate

1152
01:34:10.479 --> 01:34:12.314
and get into Harvard.

1153
01:34:12.398 --> 01:34:15.192
Those rumors are the fruits of
Miss Peterson’s poisonous tree.

1154
01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:19.613
She will be dealt with.
I assure you.

1155
01:34:25.286 --> 01:34:27.120
You don’t deserve her.

1156

You think I don’t know that?!

1157
01:34:31.542 --> 01:34:34.669
Every night when I fall
asleep with her in my arms.

1158
01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:37.590
I thank God she’s mine.

1159
01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:39.716
And every morning
when I wake up.

1160
01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:43.387
my first thought is that
I’m grateful she married me.

1161
01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:46.973
I will never be worthy of her.

1162
01:34:47.056 --> 01:34:50.894
But I will spend every
day trying my damnedest.

1163
01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.189
I know you want her.

1164
01:34:55.274 --> 01:34:58.485
But I’m telling you.
you can’t have her.

1165
01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:02.615
I don’t just want her.
I love her.

1166
01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:04.115
She’s the one.

1167
01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.117
She can’t be the one.
She’s my wife!

1168
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.411
I know.

1169
01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:13.166
I met a pretty. sweet.
Catholic girl.

1170
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:16.044
The kind of girl I’ve been
looking for my whole life.

1171
01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:17.837
When I finally asked her
to choose me.

1172
01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:19.357
she couldn’t because she was
in love with the asshole

1173
01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:21.007
that broke her heart

1174
01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.385
and will probably
break it again and again.

1175
01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:26.721
I’ll admit I was an asshole.

1176
01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:33.646
I’m not that man anymore

1177
01:35:36.357 --> 01:35:39.776
and I’m sure as hell not going
to break her heart again.

1178
01:35:39.859 --> 01:35:41.179
Then let her finish her program.

1179
01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.737
Let her?

1180
01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:44.089
Julia feels guilty
about making her grad program

1181

such a high priority.

1182
01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:47.951
She told you this?

1183
01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:49.136
She also said she
doesn’t have any friends.

1184
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.162
How convenient.

1185
01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:53.915
Are you interested in
continuing to be her friend?

1186
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.586
My friendship with
her has to end.

1187
01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:06.219
She’ll be hurt.

1188

you to change your mind.

I’ll write to her.

I spoke to you and you declined.

about your program?
