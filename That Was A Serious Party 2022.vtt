3
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.920
Can I ask
you to move a little bit

4
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.000
this way. please.

5
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120
Yes. that's perfect.

6
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.920
- Hi. I'm Freddie.

7
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.080
I am the Head Gardener.

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.480
and Secret Garden
Party is all my fault.

9
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040
Crazy. crazy ass motherfuckers.

10
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.080
Hot-housing of creative minds

11
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.360
and wreckheads together.

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.120
One of those
places that everybody

13
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.520
looked forward to
the whole year.

14
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.080
Secret Garden
was always never really

15
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.416
about the bands
or the headliners.

16
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.920
it was always about the
fact that it's a party.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.040
Being able to bear
your chest and run wild.

18
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.000
Celebrating your uniqueness
and your insanity.

19
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.280
- It kind of goes from
really sort of slick.

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.160
and everyone looks
great on Friday.

21
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.080
but by Sunday people are
literally gaffer taping

22
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.840
a wig back onto their head.

23
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.000
- I was struck by the vibrancy

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.920
and kind of new frontier
of the whole place.

25
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.160
You know. it
was like a free party.

26
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.880
but it was a festival.

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440
There were rules. but
there weren't rules.

28
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.560
All good things
must come to an end.

29
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.080
- It went from a baby to a city.

30
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.000
- Such a beautiful
piece of land.

31
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.840
You don't want to cast scorn
on the local landscape.

32
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.120
but it comes with
a sort of surprise.

33
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.680
cause you're so aware of farming

34
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.400
as an industry around here.

35
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.480
And then in the middle of it.

36
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.640
there's this magic little
paradise that people can turn up

37
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.120
and ruin over a weekend.

38
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.800
Thing with festivals is. like.

39
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.160
you work on them all year.

40
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.840
and then they only
exist for three days.

41
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.840
We've got a
medium sized town here.

42
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600
A festival builds
a city. a Brigadoon.

43
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.080
that pops up and
disappears after four days.

44
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.360
It's the land
more than anything.

45
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.440
You come here and you just get
that magic feeling. you know.

46
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.536
And there were 300
people in the first year.

47
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840
You couldn't have imagined
that it would grow to this.

48
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.560
You go in
and you can be a plumber.

49
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.160
an accountant. whatever.

50
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.880
And you come out as. you
know. Queen of Swords or.

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.920
you know. whoever
you fucking wanna be.

52
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200
And that ability
to inspire people to go

53
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.520
and make their own fun. that
has become what people expect.

54
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.920
I suppose everyone
who's into this scene

55
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.800
in one form or another can
pinpoint that first moment

56
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.080
they came across that
part of the counterculture

57
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.520
that really opened their
eyes. blew their hair back.

58
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.840
For me. it was the
late end of the raves.

59
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.880
- Often overlooked is the
role that anarchic traveling.

60
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.080
free festivals played in the
development of that culture.

61
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.240
you know.

62
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.760
50 People have been arrested.

63
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.680
and the police helicopter
fired out with flares.

64
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.000
The travelers say they won't
be moving on for a few days.

65
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.520
And tonight. the festival still
appears to be in full swing.

66
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.160
We were in all
the papers. you know.

67
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.760
We were called like the public
enemy number one. you know.

68
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.280
We had like police and
helicopters following
us everywhere.

69
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.680
Secret Garden was really
different in the sense that

70
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.880
it kind of somehow managed
to put a lot of that kind of

71
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.200
crazy. diverse stuff into
a slightly more commercial.

72
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.880
in serious inverted
commas. setting. you know.

73
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.200
And for kind of another
generation. actually.

74
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.240
How did it start?

75
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.160
- Kind of by
accident. I suppose.

76
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.720
- I don't know your excuse.

77
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.600
but I literally had no other
option for a decent job

78
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.200
or all. you know. street credit.

79
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.680
- We wanted to do a party.

80
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.000
We thought we would probably
be quite good at it.

81
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.080
- We'd had the idea of what
we thought made a good party.

82
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.800
which was all the idea of
the toys and the involvement.

83
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.920
- The influence is an
emphasis on participation

84
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.560
that didn't really
exist in the UK much

85
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.480
in festival culture
until Secret Garden Party

86
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.856
really took it to
the next level.

87
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.136
where they basically
said to everyone like.

88
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.280
"Don't come if you're
not gonna get involved."

89
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.360
- It's about time and place.

90
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.880
The opportunity to be
something different.

91
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that exists only here and now.

92
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120
And that's it.

93
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.576
- If you have a really great
time and you are colorful

94
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.816
and you feel that you
are part of the reason

95
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.320
it was a great party.

96
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.760
then those are the ones that
you'll remember all your life.

97
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.080
- There's a moment when.
however delinquent you are.

98
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.800
you finally realize that your
parents are actually farmers.

99
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.800
We have here John and Alison.

100
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.360
- "Hi. do we have
anywhere around us

101
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.320
that we could do this kind
of batshit crazy scene?"

102
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.280
That's wax earplugs.

103
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.640
I hope. Or suppositories.

104
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.400
I was like. "Well
there's the field

105
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.840
around the end of the lake."

106
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.240
Shut the fucking front door.

107
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.256
- Fred took me down to the
field and then he said.

108
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.400
"This is a beautiful field."

109
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.480
And I said. as a farmer.

110
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.640
it's not a very good
field. actually.

111
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.416
And he said. "No. no. no.
You're looking at it all wrong.

112
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.880
It's beautiful.

113
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.280
Look at the lake. the
trees. all the rest of it.

114
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.800
It's a great place
for a musical event."

115
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.280
Now I knew we were not talking
about choirs and orchestras.

116
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.440
- He did tell me that he
was somewhat trepidatious

117
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560
to be doing that.

118
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.800
- No shit.

119
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.080
And it was such a
good opportunity.

120
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.416
So we decided to
do our own party.

121
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.536
It's pain in the
ass trying to think

122
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.040
of the name for an event.

123
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.776
Anyone who's ever tried to
start a rock band or do the.

124
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.256
you know. will tell
you the same thing.

125
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.360
Listening to Radio 4.
children's. you know.

126
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.000
story time came on and
Secret Garden Party.

127
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.856
- Do I talk to the
camera or to you?

128
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.040
Just to me. just to me.

129
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.320
- Okay. My name's
Eddy Temple-Morris.

130
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.680
I'm a DJ producer. and my
proudest title is Patron Saint

131
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.440
of the Secret Garden Party.

132
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.880
Freddie approached me
through the XFM website

133
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.520
and said that they
loved my show.

134
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.000
that I'd be perfect for this
party that they were throwing.

135
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.360
I thought it looked
and sounded fantastic.

136
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.760
So I said. "Yeah. where
do I sign? I'm in?"

137
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.240
- So we duly did that and
about 700 people turned up.

138
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.400
And a lot of our
friends who went there.

139
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.616
loved the vibe of the party.

140
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.520
loved the freedom
of what you could do

141
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.120
and. you know. the general
style and the culture around it.

142
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.976
- Try and sit up a bit.
might be good if...

143
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.160
I think we got a bit
of a tendency to hunch.

144
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.760
- I'm Ned.

145
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.280
- I'm Maff from The Egg.

146
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.520
- I'm from The Egg as well.

147
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.960
We're a live electronic
dance music stuff.

148
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.600
And we've been
playing Secret Garden

149
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.880
since the beginning.

150
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.400
- Yeah. We have a
friend Grantley.

151
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.456
He said. "There are these people
who wanna do the best party

152
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.240
in the world ever and
they want you to play."

153
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.800
And I was like. "Okay. great."

154
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.440
And it's all really
funny and ridiculous

155
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.000
and eccentric and goodly silly.

156
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.600
- Secret Garden Party!

157
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.400
- It was the start of something
really. really special.

158
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.400
- You're always talking to us.

159
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.440
- Not the giant cock behind you.

160
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.440
We moved here
nearly 20 years ago.

161
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.440
Everyone knows everyone.

162
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.400
My husband's on
the parish council.

163
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.400
and suddenly a party arrives.

164
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.560
And "Oh. we don't want
them. Think of the traffic.

165
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.520
Think of the noise and
they're not even local.

166
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.000
And what do we get out of it?

167
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.840
And I don't want my children
going because that'd be awful."

168
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.560
And then you see these
children who snuck in

169
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.480
at the beginning.

170
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600
- Back in those days...

171
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.440
- I had no money.

172
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.640
- I didn't have a ticket.

173
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.680
So. I looked for ways to get in.

174
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.576
We'd already invented
the game of trying to find

175
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.520
someone that had
actually bought a ticket.

176
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.680
- You know. I've been there
when the kids are kind of

177
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.120
drunken and disheveled
behind the toilets going.

178
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.200
"Oh. gosh."

179
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.600
- I'm Pete Loveday.

180
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.200
And what is Pete Loveday?

181
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.520
Probably someone
who's been with this festival

182
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.560
for 13 years doing
artwork for them.

183
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.680
How did you get involved?

184
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.680
Just a phone
call out of nowhere.

185
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.440
And it was Freddie.

186
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.520
Cause he'd read
the Russell Comics

187
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.080
and come down to check it out

188
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.000
and see whether I fancy
doing artwork for him.

189
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.520
He'd found a few images there
that probably made him think

190
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.080
that I. I might know what
a festival was about.

191
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.560
And what did you think?

192
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.160
- Well. I thought it was very
small and it was very sweet.

193
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.280
It had one stage.

194
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.640
- By the lake. which is now

195
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.920
the Where The Wild
Things Are stage.

196
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.160
- And the pagoda sorted
being used for DJ's.

197
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.280
- The dance area
was a tree house.

198
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.600
- The magic boots? Do you
remember the magic boots?

199
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.840
- Or the Fuck Yeah bar
with the cars outside

200
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.600
that people pushed
into the lake.

201
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.560
It was the definition of just
fucking reckless abandon.

202
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.600
- Yeah. it was great.

203
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.440
We rocked up and
the moment we started.

204
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.440
it was just one enormous fiesta.

205
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.600
- First time I went
to SGP. I was...

206
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.600
I must have been
dressed as a cow.

207
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.776
- Then shit got really
outta hand for five years.

208
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.680
- Well. I can't remember
the 14th. the second one.

209
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.000
but I certainly can
remember the 13th one.

210
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.520
Why was
that particularly memorable?

211
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.000
- I went down the rabbit hole.

212
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.440
And then I came out and
I was in a couple of mud

213
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.760
with lots of pretty girls.

214
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.640
And with this really
wicked little sound system

215
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.760
that somebody had
made out of bits.

216
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.440
And we were in a tent
that was literally

217
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.760
just kind of half fallen down.

218
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.040
but we were dry and we
were warm and we were

219
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.920
in this little space and
this is the Secret Garden.

220
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.720
It was incredibly difficult
not to let your hair down.

221
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.000
We've gone from literally
three muddy stages to this.

222
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.120
- My sister. Fred's mom. was
slightly tearing her hair out

223
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.120
because each year the festival
had got bigger and better

224
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.320
and the loss had got bigger
and better every year.

225
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.960
They were very casual
about. you know. receipts.

226
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.480
I think we
started getting it quite well

227
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.680
developed in 2005. which
is. I think also when we

228
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.120
started noticing the sort
of quite parabolic increase

229
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.560
in our attendees.

230
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.680
And then 2006 got very popular.

231
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.680
We got very lucky with
a couple of bookings.

232
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.520
- 2006 was like. we'd
booked by accident...

233
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.440
Well. not by accident.

234
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.920
She was brilliant. Lily Allen.

235
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.920
- Go well today?

236
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.160
- Went really. really well.

237
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.840
I didn't think it was
gonna go very well

238
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.200
cause it was raining
and there were no people

239
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.960
out to the front stage.

240
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.320
And then suddenly there were.

241
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.480
- We had people turning
up with picnic chairs

242
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.680
and like they'd printed
out the program.

243
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.776
- They wanted to know where
the information booth was

244
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800
and we're just like...

245
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.480
- And the best complaint letter
we had in the early years

246
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.080
was someone who thought they'd
found the information desk.

247
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.840
They got handcuffed to
each other and then pointed

248
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.560
to 500 keys hanging
from fishing wire

249
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.040
and told one of these keys
is gonna set you free.

250
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.936
- Everyone harps back
to the good old days.

251
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.080
"The good old days.

252
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.456
My days. my days when
I was coming up."

253
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.680
"Oh. it was magic. wasn't it?"

254
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.200
You know. magical
time. magical time.

255
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.056
- I told my friends I was
going to Secret Garden

256
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.520
and they all kind
of laughed at me.

257
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.496
They were like. "Are you going
to that posh kids' party?"

258
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.976
Back in the day.
it was seen as a posh party

259
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.760
because people wore 60 pound
animal hats and drank Pims.

260
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.240
- I actually ended up doing
my 40th birthday party there.

261
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.600
So I had like 150
people all turned up.

262
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.240
Everybody like in pure white.

263
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.800
- And yeah. it was. it was
quite polite. wasn't it?

264
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.640
- And it was sometimes like.
"Are we running a festival?"

265
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920
- Fred called me.

266
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.640
And he said. "I would like talk
to you about some festival."

267
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.760
I said to Fred. I said.

268
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.720
"Listen. I'm going
to come with Desmond

269
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.520
and let's see what happens."

270
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.000
- Are ready to sing?

271
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.800
- And when we walk out on
stage. it was in the thousands.

272
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.640
I went. "Oh my God. Secret
Garden Party is born."

273
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.440
- And suddenly like
the time I was going.

274
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.040
they're the best festival ever.

275
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.600
- Honestly. on the
Saturday night.

276
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.840
it really was as if
everyone was. you know.

277
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.520
high up on one thing or
another with a glow stick

278
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.840
sticking out of their nostril.

279
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.840
running around like
blue ass flies.

280
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.880
Been to
Glastonbury fairly regularly.

281
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.160
We didn't go to Burning
Man until summer of 2006.

282
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.600
- If we're being honest.

283
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.200
Secret Garden Party borrowed
a lot from Burning Man.

284
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.976
Which is like an art
festival that everyone's

285
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.840
doing something. burning
something. dressing up

286
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.800
and making. just anything
to get people to interact.

287
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.240
It's still
one of the best parties

288
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.640
I've ever been to because
the people you'll meet.

289
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.880
things to do and interact
with. the creativity

290
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.840
and the capability
that's brought to it.

291
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.720
is just jaw dropping.

292
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.040
- You realize that actually
it is okay to be this

293
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.560
fucking indulgently
bonkers in the whimsical.

294
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.976
- But Burning Man is
a little bit po-faced

295
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.280
and they take it
really seriously

296
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.080
whereas here it was
just all about fun.

297
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200
Action.

298
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.720
- Can we do it again?
That was fucking shit.

299
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.840
The level of
dedication to nonsense

300
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.800
was unparalleled in any
of the other festivals.

301
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.600
even Glastonbury to
a certain extent.

302
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.520
They took the most bizarre
and weird parts of Glastonbury

303
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.000
and just went pew.

304
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.200
This is the raw bones
of the nonsense.

305
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.080
and we're gonna give it
to you here in one place.

306
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.776
- We made an agreement
with Secret Garden

307
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.680
that I would come here and
make something amazing.

308
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.280
I believe it was like. I
promised a spontaneous miracle.

309
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.736
Nice to have your
own phone line here

310
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.880
and the landline. too. Mom?

311
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.240
Your have reached a number

312
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.760
that has been disconnected.

313
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.120
- I was taken to a barn where
almost all of that stuff

314
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.840
was found. I mean.
this is quality goods.

315
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.560
It's all those cans.
I brought with me

316
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.320
from the last
festival in Ireland.

317
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.840
I had a huge bag. I was
like loitering in. you know.

318
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.200
kind of customs.

319
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.160
Like somebody please ask
me what's in this huge bag.

320
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.480
I was like. "Na. na. na."

321
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.240
You know. looking
suspicious. Nothing.

322
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.656
They didn't want any.
they didn't care.

323
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.960
I wanted to like open
it up and go. "Ha-ha!

324
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.040
You ever seen that before?"

325
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.936
Nothing. And some of the
people were looking at me.

326
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.960
kinda like "You're such a dick."

327
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.160
- In this screwed up. over
health and safety-ised.

328
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.680
very controlled English.
stiff upper lip culture.

329
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.256
Secret Garden proves
that. you know.

330
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.520
we can have the same vibes
as a Favela in Brazil.

331
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.000
at least for a few days anyway.

332
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.160
You know what I mean?

333
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.440
- When I first joined
Secret Garden Party. it was-

334
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.720
- Shambles.

335
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.376
- It was the biggest
circus I've ever seen.

336
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.800
I thought everyone
was going to die

337
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.656
and people were just coming
into the office going.

338
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.120
"I'm just going to
suicide Olympics.

339
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.000
Where's the suicide Olympics."

340
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.360
Are they
literally suicide Olympics?

341
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.640
- Pretty much. It was a
wheelchair on the top of a hill

342
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.456
and they used to just
push people down there.

343
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.000
- So. I mean. I
remember the first year

344
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.840
of watching someone in the
wheelchair go down the hill.

345
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.360
- It was the tractor tire.

346
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.056
That one went all the way
down the hill with the.

347
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.400
with the guy in
it. into the lake.

348
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.256
And that was. and then he
didn't come out for ages.

349
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.760
We were like "Where's the.
where's the guy gone?"

350
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.040
- Well. I think as long as
they don't drain the lake.

351
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.920
We were willing
to give anyone a chance

352
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.480
who had a crazy enough
idea that sounded like

353
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.040
we could execute it
and then develop them

354
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.480
and help them along
the way on that.

355
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.920
- So I used to do this
thing where I would

356
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.960
forge a load of
doctors' prescriptions.

357
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.080
dress up as a doctor and
break into festivals.

358
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.400
And on Sunday I'd walk around
writing people off sick

359
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.240
so they could stay
out and party more.

360
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.736
And I was sitting with
these people drinking

361
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.880
their champagne.

362
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.080
There was someone
there who was chatting

363
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.040
and he. you know. I thought he
was being a little bit cocky.

364
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.600
So I quietly wrote him
out of prescription.

365
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.120
describing him with cock throat

366
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.000
and explaining to
him or his jewels

367
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.200
would start to sink down
into his throat scrotum

368
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.696
and the cock would
come out of hid mouth.

369
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.080
And he looked at
it for a little bit

370
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.640
and he just went. "Are they
paying you to be here?"

371
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.720
I was like. "No. I jumped
over the fence like always."

372
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.640
And he went. "This
is our festival."

373
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.400
And he said. "Okay.
come next time

374
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.160
and bring some people
and do something."

375
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.536
You've talked
about Vito. haven't you?

376
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.360
Yeah. if you say.

377
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.760
have you got a few words to say?

378
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.720
- What? You asking me who I am?

379
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.720
Mm?

380
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.640
- Vito was ridiculous.

381
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.000
Beautifully. happily.
joyfully visible at all times.

382
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.920
He'd say goodbye to
you and he'd say.

383
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.600
"I'll see you in my dreams."

384
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.096
Or something stupid and then
he'd suddenly disappear.

385
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.200
And literally 10. 15 minutes
later. he'd come back

386
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.160
and he was in a completely
different costume

387
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.320
Different makeup even.

388
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.120
And he'd gone back
to his little hole

389
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.440
where he did these magical
things and he'd just get...

390
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.240
And the whole reason for it
was just to make you gasp.

391
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.200
- Think he was particularly
proud of being able

392
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.040
to of coined 'This
is a serious party'.

393
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.040
- And walked around
with his sign on him

394
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.496
He got on stage a few
times. danced with us.

395
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.440
- I mean. I don't
remember the first time.

396
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.160
It was sort of. one
of those things where

397
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.400
he just always seemed to be
around at the garden party.

398
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.960
By the time that he'd got
his iconic sign. we'd met.

399
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.880
- I invited him to
compere for Artful Badger.

400
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.200
He's an incredible compere
and incredible energy.

401
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.440
- I got him to do the.
"Oh. How Lucky You Are"

402
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.080
business from Dr. Seuss.
to open the rabbit hole.

403
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.160
- Ladies and gentlemen. I'd
like to introduce you to.

404
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.520
The Cat in the Hat.

405
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.000
- And he did the entire thing.

406
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.160
- 'No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no.'

407
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280
- Verbatim.

408
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.680
- 'Congratulations.
today is your day.

409
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.560
You're off to great places.
You're off and away.'

410
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.440
- Got it completely
right. I think.

411
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.120
- 'You have brains in your head.

412
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.760
You have feet in your shoes.

413
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.200
You can steer yourself any
which direction you choose'.

414
00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.320
- We were all going a bit
like. "Can we get on with it?

415
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.120
Can we get on with this? We
wanna hear the band now."

416
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.200
- 'Oh. the places you'll go.
you'll be on your way up.

417
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.560
You'll be seeing great sights.

418
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.000
You'll join the high flyers
who soar to high heights."

419
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.120
- In 2007. me and a
guy called Dickie Cohen

420
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.840
did mud wrestling
at Glastonbury.

421
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.280
It went down really well.

422
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.560
We got some Barbie dolls.

423
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.056
- Not Barbie dolls.
but they were like-

424
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.280
- Yeah.
okay. Cabbage Patch.

425
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.280
- No. they were like
sort of ugly little like-

426
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.720
- Trolls?

427
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.296
- Something between My Little
Pony and a Barbie doll.

428
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.800
I can't remember where. I
dunno where we got them from.

429
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.160
- We put them in
the bowl full of mud

430
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.480
and had them wrestling.

431
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.896
We had like weird legs
and arms sticking out.

432
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.720
And then one arm was
holding a proposal.

433
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.320
- And we put it in a box.

434
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.600
- And then we just sent that
to Secret Garden Party HQ.

435
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.856
We didn't want any money at all.

436
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880
We just wanted five tickets

437
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.400
and we'd do
everything ourselves.

438
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.400
So in 2007. me and Dickie
hand dug a mud pit.

439
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.200
It took us three days to dig.

440
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.136
And then we just stood
around it with megaphones.

441
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.400
getting people to wrestle.

442
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.056
- The mud pit was just
like a continued success.

443
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.320
And everyone knew it.
Loads of people liked it.

444
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.240
But of course. we
didn't have a lid.

445
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.400
So loads of people slept in it.

446
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.280
Like cuddled in
it. pissed in it.

447
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.480
I mean all sorts like. you know.

448
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.320
people passed out in
it while someone else

449
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.440
was pissing in it.

450
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.176
At like two o'clock in the
morning. I was just like.

451
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.240
"I am not getting
involved in this."

452
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.160
- I can't see. I can't see.

453
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.600
- I remember one year.
I got about 25 people in

454
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.680
and I thought this had the
potential to get quite sexy.

455
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.480
But then there was just a few
guys. just writhing around

456
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.520
and just started almost
fucking each other in the mud.

457
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.520
And it escalated really quickly.

458
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.320
And that was the start
of the Collosillium.

459
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.800
10 years later. it's this
massive 2000 capacity venue.

460
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.480
And we have a strong belief
that we are not the headliners.

461
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.840
It's the crowd.

462
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.320
So then we played
ridiculous games.

463
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.120
'Wax on. wax off'. where
you are on the aerial truss

464
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.880
and you're ripping off
hair with wax strips.

465
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.240
- We had a new game called.
'Whose Anus Is This Anyway?'

466
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.240
Four bums. four girls
guessing the boyfriend's bums.

467
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.200
She's very sure it's his bottom

468
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.680
but she's not sure
about the balls.

469
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.960
- This girl.
beautiful. she decided

470
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.240
that she definitely knew
it was her boyfriend's bum.

471
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.200
And instead of like
just kissing it.

472
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.360
she licked the bum
right in the middle.

473
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.600
- Full crack.
- Full crack.

474
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.640
Well that was daring. well done.

475
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.560
- But at least it's
your boyfriend.

476
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.400
- At least it's your boyfriend.

477
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.520
She picked it wrong.

478
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.216
How do you
circumvent health and safety?

479
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.520
- Yeah. You don't circumvent
health and safety.

480
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.440
- When you're creating things
like this in the sort of space

481
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.880
that we are talking about.

482
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.600
we kind of hope people
subscribe to the danger aspect.

483
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.160
What was the guy's name

484
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.400
in health and safety?

485
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.176
- He's actually. he's
asked not to be named

486
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.880
and remain anonymous.

487
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.280
- Truth be told a lot of the
crazies I saw running around.

488
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.800
they were pretty aware of
how insane this place was.

489
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.520
It's this safety third thing.

490
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.360
First. have fun.
Second. have more fun.

491
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.600
And then think.
is this dangerous?

492
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.960
- Even if someone did
come out with no leg.

493
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.440
it was just like.

494
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.360
"Hey. I've scarred my leg
for life. but it's fine."

495
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.360
Not that I think
that's a good thing.

496
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.160
And now we're much more
professional. of course.

497
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.040
We're much more professional.

498
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.840
- It always helps
if it looks like

499
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.720
you've completely thrown
the rule book away

500
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.360
because the public love that.

501
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.496
But you know. at the end of
the day. they're our guests.

502
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.440
We need to look after them and
send them home in one piece.

503
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.280
- The model that all
those guys came up with

504
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.000
was that they got all these
micro venues together.

505
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.600
Each one of those
micro venues was run

506
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.160
by a really cool posse.

507
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.520
They all came together and
each one of those little crews

508
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.480
pulled like a mule.

509
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.480
- There's things. there's
the action counselors.

510
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.576
There's the physics council.

511
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.656
there's the political things.

512
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.016
There's lots of
discussions about stuff.

513
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.960
- Me and Jim were like
obsessed with 9/11

514
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.480
conspiracy theories.

515
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.536
So we were like. "Hey.
let's do a conspiracy camp."

516
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.560
So then I. we invited
all these David Icke's

517
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.440
and journalists
and ex MI5 agents

518
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.600
and all these weirdo's
and conspiracy theorists

519
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.880
into this tent which was
decked out like the war room

520
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.720
in Stanley Kubrick's.
'Dr. Strangelove'.

521
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.840
- Once the foundation
perception of reality is flawed.

522
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.800
everything that comes from
that must by definition.

523
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.320
be flawed.

524
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.120
- The idea of bringing serious
academics and professors

525
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.480
and serious people
into this environment

526
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.240
where everyone's like
naked and on drugs.

527
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.320
And it's all crazy and
hectic and hedonistic.

528
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.440
that really appealed to me.

529
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.240
- Is that a cucumber?
That's a cucumber.

530
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.160
That's a cucumber.

531
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.680
- Cucumber. cucumber. cucumber.

532
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.200
- E.T. phone homo.

533
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.520
- When it comes to like
representing LGBT+ communities

534
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.480
at festivals. like it's
actually really poor.

535
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.640
Glastonbury's championed that
with like Block9 festival.

536
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.016
have done some
good stuff as well.

537
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.400
but like Secret Garden
Party was always

538
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.240
a very open. friendly festival.

539
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.360
So I think lots of gay people
used to gravitate there.

540
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.600
We originally
asked to do a tent.

541
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.880
the kind of ceremony
celebration of coming out.

542
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.680
Someone sent us a thousand
bottles of poppers.

543
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.480
So poppers actually
sponsored the first gay bar.

544
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.440
It meant that our
tent was really busy.

545
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.560
It's sweaty. it's
amazing. it smells of mud

546
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.760
and all the sweat
and human bodies.

547
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.560
And then all of the kind of
chemicals which are coming out

548
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.960
of everyone's pores.

549
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.600
It's a little like
a chemical toilet.

550
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.960
but like kind of sexier.

551
00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.520
And it just turns into this
dirty. amazing little ray

552
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.120
that just never seems
to sort of stop.

553
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.120
One guy who sort of
grabbed the microphone.

554
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.840
he was like super nervous.

555
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.280
We stopped the music and he
came out and he started crying.

556
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.360
His friends started
crying. I started crying.

557
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.640
And then the whole tent was
just like weeping for this guy.

558
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.856
And his friends were celebrating
him and they were like.

559
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.640
"Oh my God. we never knew."

560
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.160
And I was like. yeah.

561
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.536
And you look at him and
he's covered in glitter

562
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.520
and I was like. "How
did you not know?"

563
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.960
Having that place where
people can be celebrated.

564
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.480
people can be who they want to
be and be empowered for that

565
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.520
is always what we've stood for.

566
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.400
Come inside my bar.

567
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.400
it will change your life
and the size of your anus.

568
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.480
- Things like
introducing drug testing.

569
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.080
first festival to do that.

570
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.520
- So I'm Henry Fisher. I'm one
of the testers for The Loop.

571
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.840
We provide advice on drug
use and sexual health

572
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.560
for people at festivals
and other events.

573
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.480
Last year was the first year
when we were able to actually

574
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.880
provide multi-agency
safety testing.

575
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.200
So that's where people can
come and bring a little scoop

576
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.400
of powder or a bit of a pill.
or ideally a whole pill.

577
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.200
We then find out
what's in the sample

578
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.320
and we can tell 'em
how strong it is.

579
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.536
So you are not telling people

580
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.760
not to take drugs?

581
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.920
We neither
condone or condemn drug use.

582
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.560
We know it's gonna happen.

583
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.256
So what we're trying to do is
just make sure that they don't

584
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.440
end up in the welfare tent
or worse. in hospital.

585
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.880
That was a great.
great thing to be a part of.

586
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.640
And certainly something
that. you know.

587
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.000
it helps if you're independent.

588
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.280
to be able to make that move.

589
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.040
- Are people who come
to you suspicious?

590
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.560
They were suspicious at first

591
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.936
because it was such a new thing.

592
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.360
Now there's a bit
more publicity.

593
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.761
People have heard us a bit
more. It's been really popular.

594
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.016
We wouldn't
have been able to do it

595
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.576
without the support of
our local police force

596
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.160
who were awesome
in their response.

597
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.080
It's something we'd been
talking to them about

598
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.320
for a couple of years.

599
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.680
And I know when it first
got mentioned. it was a.

600
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.680
a very uncomfortable concept.

601
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.816
The reasoning they went
through was very interesting.

602
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.560
Their primary directive
is the prevention of harm.

603
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.720
Their secondary directive is
the persecution of criminality.

604
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.800
Once you've entered
into the event

605
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.936
and you've gone through the
searches and all that security.

606
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.160
the option for that
second directive has gone.

607
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.640
If you are going to be able
to effectively discharge your

608
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.120
primary directive
of reducing harm.

609
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.320
And this is not an opportunity
to persecute petty.

610
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.400
civil disobedience.

611
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.920
So far. how's
the quality of the drugs been?

612
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.640
- It's been really
variable and it always is.

613
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.840
We've had a few very
strong pills so far.

614
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.600
which is as much
of a worry as well.

615
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.800
We're telling people
to take a quarter.

616
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.736
But then we've had some.
some really awful things.

617
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.560
I think we had some
plaster of paris.

618
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.760
happened to us yesterday.

619
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.840
that someone was
sold on site as MDMA.

620
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.880
- Prohibition has been
doing more harm than drugs

621
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.800
since whatever it is. 1963.

622
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.360
If drugs are. you know.

623
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.376
have a dangerous side.
they should be controlled.

624
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.681
And to be able to at least
used. if they're gonna be used.

625
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.960
in a safe way.

626
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.240
A word of balloons?

627
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.600
- That omnipotent sound.

628
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.800
- So laughing gas. yeah.

629
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.480
Nitrous oxide occurred
through this period

630
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.160
and suddenly everybody
was doing it.

631
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.640
I remember getting
there for the Monday...

632
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.800
No. I was there from
Sunday. I can't remember.

633
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.440
I think I arrived with Ans.

634
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.440
And there's a big.
huge tube of it.

635
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.040
And I had some. and I
blacked out and fell over.

636
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.760
Hit my head on
this picnic table.

637
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.560
And I went to hospital and
I think we played a festival

638
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.136
on the main stage a
couple of weeks later.

639
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.040
And I went on stage and said.

640
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.360
"Laughing gas. right.
it's not that funny."

641
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.800
- It's no laughing matter.
- No.

642
00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.840
- When it first
appeared on the scene.

643
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.600
one of our crew started
off with a gas bar.

644
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.936
Yeah. I think you got mentioned

645
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.296
in the same sentence
as laughing gas.

646
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.440
- Never.
- There you go.

647
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.760
- Yes.
- But I did hear it from you.

648
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.640
- I think the people
running it made a very.

649
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.120
very nice little fortune.

650
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.280
I had a girlfriend
who did a nitrous oxide stall

651
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.360
at the Garden Party.

652
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.320
And so we organized
a. a big tank.

653
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.800
It was. it was just
totally fucking ridiculous.

654
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.920
I mean. there's people sort
of burning their mouths on it.

655
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.280
There's people literally
just falling over.

656
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.120
We had to like confiscate it

657
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.440
cause people are still
squabbling over it.

658
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.800
Hippie fucking crack.

659
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.760
- Now the new psychoactive
substance laws come in.

660
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.800
we have gone to it now being
the preferred drug for sale

661
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.200
by organized criminal
gangs at festivals.

662
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.160
Now. if you think about
the upstring on that

663
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.936
and the consequences for
getting caught with it.

664
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.760
it is not really a big win
in that area for that law.

665
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.000
Especially not for us at
the bloody edge of it.

666
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.776
- Are we not here
to talk about music?

667
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.120
- I'm Lissie.

668
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.000
This is like the coolest
place we've ever been I think.

669
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.880
- Yeah.

670
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.360
The new music has
come through the festival.

671
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.800
where you think that
Where The Wild Things Are.

672
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.560
which is a very small stage
kind of built into a tree.

673
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.896
And the artists we've
had come through that.

674
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.840
from Florence and The
Machine and The XX

675
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.040
and Lily Allen and Daughter
and all these kind of acts.

676
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.360
as time gone on.
they then kind of

677
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.040
upgraded to the main stage.

678
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.240
Crystal Fighters were one
of our headliners this year.

679
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.480
on the final year.

680
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.880
They came to the
festival as punters

681
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.360
and it inspired them to start
the band in the first place.

682
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.720
That I think is. is
part of what's important

683
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.440
with Secret Garden Party.

684
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.960
it's inspired. not
just us and punters.

685
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.200
but inspired the
artists as well.

686
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.000
- All of the acts that were
booked into the Garden Party

687
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.920
understood the
ethos of the show.

688
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.040
You can play and we
can't pay loads of money

689
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.360
cause we haven't got it.

690
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.080
cause we spent it all
on fluff and bunting.

691
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.320
And when you finish playing

692
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.360
get in the party
with everyone else.

693
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.120
DJs who are used to getting
paid six figures for a set

694
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.680
would come and play for free.

695
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.240
That's how we managed to bank
all the early headliners.

696
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.976
DJs love playing
at the Collisillium.

697
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.920
We've had Disclosure. Sub
Focus. Chase & Status.

698
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.600
Roni Size. all the
Hospital Records guys

699
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.400
and a whole range
of like massive DJs.

700
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.160
These guys who came
over from America

701
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.400
and came back backstage with me.

702
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.880
Dickie and Frodo
and Timmy were like.

703
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.176
"Say man. what you doing now?"

704
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.920
He's. "Oh man. you know.
I'm just gonna go back

705
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.200
to the hotel. you know."

706
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.840
And we were like.
"No. you're not.

707
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.000
You're gonna come back to
the sweaty lingerie party.

708
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.496
And you're just gonna
take off your trousers

709
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.720
and like wander
around in your pants."

710
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.000
And he is like. "Okay.
I'm gonna do that."

711
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.680
- There wasn't any pandering.

712
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.440
Grace Jones. you know. exception

713
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.960
cause she was a
bloody nightmare.

714
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.920
- She wanted to
have a scissor lift

715
00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.320
that kind of brought her up.

716
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.440
But the people in charge
of doing that before.

717
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.320
perhaps they didn't
have the ability

718
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.880
to organize something like that.

719
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.040
So it pretty much was
one of our stage crew

720
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.000
with Grace Jones
on their shoulders.

721
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.680
And he just kind
of went like this.

722
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.280
- You'd never go
to garden party to.

723
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.560
because of the band lineup.

724
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.120
sorry James Brennan
but you wouldn't.

725
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.000
But like it's. you'd go to
garden party for so much more.

726
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.040
Tell us
about that complaint email

727
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.360
that you got from somebody.

728
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.096
- I love it.
- You make it sound like

729
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.320
there's just been
one in 15 years.

730
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.176
We get. you know. depending
on the year we. you know.

731
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.200
you get one or two.

732
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.760
If it's been a very good year.

733
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.280
you. you know. you
normally get one.

734
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.800
A very wet year. you
can get a lot more.

735
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.400
Last year's which
has. we had a love.

736
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.640
brilliant year. last year.

737
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.240
And it was the only real
letter of complaint.

738
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.240
Her major beef was. she
was promised Secret Places

739
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.760
and she couldn't find them.

740
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.840
- Well. sorry for that.

741
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.600
But you missed this secret and
this secret and this secret.

742
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.400
this secret and that
you didn't find them

743
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.040
is not really our fault.

744
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.040
Well. that's the thing about

745
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.200
the Secret Garden Party.

746
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.800
It's about the
little secret things

747
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.040
that actually. for me. make
the festival so wonderful.

748
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.040
- S&Empathy. that was good.

749
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.640
- We did the Dog House.

750
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.880
It's just a little place
where we just play filthy.

751
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.120
dirty. funky dance music.

752
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.320
I seem to remember that
time when we lost the power.

753
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.656
Yeah. yeah. So after
the power went down.

754
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.200
we were following
the blue power cable.

755
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.080
pulling it out the mud tryna
figure out where it had gone.

756
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.600
I went inside a tent. I kind
of unzipped it and went in.

757
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.880
And as I walked in.

758
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.600
there's 200 naked people
having a massive rave.

759
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.856
I didn't even know we
were next to a sort of

760
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.680
secret naked rave tent.

761
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.120
- One of my favorite things
doing was with sunflower field.

762
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.456
Fred built a field of sunflowers

763
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.160
and put a row of
toilets against one side

764
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.960
with the back cut
out of the toilet.

765
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.200
You walk through and then

766
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.200
into this sunflower field.

767
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.896
- We didn't tell her
that the sunflowers

768
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.560
were in the secret places
cause that'd been a bit mean.

769
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.240
Could you state your real name?

770
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.480
- My name's Ian Duff.

771
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.400
What do you do here?

772
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.160
I run the Secret Bar.

773
00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.440
- I first met Ian in
2006 and Ian was sort of.

774
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.120
kind of ricocheting behind
the bar and he asked me.

775
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.160
"What day is it?". I went.
"it's Friday morning."

776
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.640
And Duff went. "Fuck. I've
been awake for four days.

777
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.840
I'm going to bed."

778
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.600
And literally just
disappeared off to bed.

779
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.200
Right.

780
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.736
And how many years have
you been doing Secret Bar?

781
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.856
I can't actually
remember how many years.

782
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.480
It's all kind of
merged into one.

783
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.336
Set up the bar. we gave
all the booze away for free

784
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.600
if people could find it.

785
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.680
- Yeah. How did he
ever run that bar?

786
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.120
Who was paying
for all the booze?

787
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.800
- We hid the bar in various
places throughout the site.

788
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.160
And then if they found the bar.

789
00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.520
they could have a free drink.

790
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.720
Open to anyone as long
as you can find it.

791
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.000
- I mean. the first few years

792
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.480
we were right next
to Duff's Bar.

793
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.160
Everybody just sort of went
from Duff's to get refreshed

794
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.400
and relax for a little bit and
then come to ours for a quick

795
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.576
hour on the dance floor and
then back to Duff's again.

796
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.880
- As people got
to know about it.

797
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.400
they tended to take the piss.

798
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.880
So we changed it a little bit
to make it a little bit more.

799
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.280
well a little bit
more participatory.

800
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.200
Where the drinks are free

801
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.800
if you're willing to perform

802
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.736
one of several silly. bad
ideas that we came up with.

803
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.840
This year. we've got
the bartender haircut.

804
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.240
topless electric fence limbo.

805
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.360
We tend to make the people
who don't join in. pay.

806
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.960
Right. yeah.

807
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.280
So that. that's how
we kind of make ends meet.

808
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400
Yeah. fair enough.

809
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.960
- But we never really
make ends meet.

810
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.400
- I remember
actually going to...

811
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.096
I remember. was it last
year the year before?

812
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.440
I'd gone to see Air
on the main stage

813
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.680
and all these girls were
dancing around me. kind of going

814
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.200
"Oh my God. it's like I'm
orgasming. It's amazing."

815
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.040
And uh...
- Who said that? You did?

816
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.320
- No. no. not me.

817
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.120
Some of the girls I
know were like dancing.

818
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.520
the music's like. "Oh man.
I'm just having this orgasm."

819
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.960
So. and then afterwards-

820
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.080
- They said that?
- Yeah. they said that.

821
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.440
- Okay.
- Yeah.

822
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.480
And then we went backstage
and I met the drummer

823
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.080
and I said. "So what's it
like playing drums in there?"

824
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.040
And he said. "Well.
they told me to play

825
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.120
like I'm making love
to a beautiful woman.

826
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.120
but you're never
actually coming."

827
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.576
And isn't that
funny that the girls

828
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.240
all actually felt the
same vibe from them. Easy.

829
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.680
Anyway. we took
him to Duff's Bar

830
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.240
and got them completely twatted.

831
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.360
- Sorry about that.
- Just fucking breaking strings.

832
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.200
I like breaking
strings. it's fun.

833
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.720
Does anyone know where
the Artful Badger tent is?

834
00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.480
When Garden Party started

835
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.160
it was pretty camp to watch it.

836
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.736
Garden Party
was reacting to something

837
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.880
that wasn't there
and wasn't being fed.

838
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.760
Suddenly. festival has become

839
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.360
incredibly mainstream.

840
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.640
- There need to be festivals
that have their independence.

841
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.216
And when you have
your independence.

842
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.400
there's a bit of a trade off.

843
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.000
You have to do a dance
with law enforcement

844
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.480
and local authority.

845
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.920
At the same time. it also means

846
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.040
that you're not
swallowing corporate cock.

847
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.480
People are not trying to shaft
something really horrible

848
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.920
and big and unappetizing
down your gullet.

849
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.880
And that is important

850
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.320
because you will have

851
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.480
all the strings associated
with sponsorship.

852
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440
They're nasty.

853
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.400
- We went to New York and it was

854
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.480
the Woodstock Reunion Festival.

855
00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.480
Big corporate love
and peace pizzas

856
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.480
and Pepsi logos and
everything everywhere.

857
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.560
But these kinda topless guys
on stage with oil saying.

858
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.200
let's go and see how much
love there is at Woodstock.

859
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.400
And Woodstock money.
which people ran out of.

860
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.560
And people pulling fences down.

861
00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.480
Commercialism.

862
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.400
that's what some people say led

863
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.560
to the fall of Woodstock 99.

864
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.200
Garden Party's always been

865
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.480
that kind of fuck you
to that corporate scene.

866
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.760
We're doing it for us.

867
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.880
We're not doing it to
earn money because like.

868
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.600
who the fuck earned money
out of Secret Garden Party.

869
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.160
Like definitely not any of us.

870
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.880
SGP started organically.

871
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.960
So it requires a lot of
interaction and. you know.

872
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.520
buy in from people.

873
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.080
If you go out to try and
invent and create a massive

874
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.960
counter-cultural
significant thing.

875
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.480
you're gonna end up
with probably something
very different.

876
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.440
Hit the mic.

877
00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.000
Let's see whose
headset's still on.

878
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.560
- Oh no. it's stopped.
- Testing.

879
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.400
I'll get
the sound man to see if-

880
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.520
- Yeah. it's stopped.

881
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520
- Ah. what's that?

882
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.800
- This is the H6.

883
00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.760
It's much more superior
than the original zoom.

884
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.760
- There we go.

885
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.160
Secret Garden Party's
contribution to
festival culture.

886
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.560
- So there was a review
in like Mixmag or DJ.

887
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.120
one of those things.

888
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.656
There was actually a
review of V Festival.

889
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.200
It was this whole column
being able to site

890
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.280
and this band. and this
band. and this band.

891
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.760
and this band. and this band.

892
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.200
And you know. all the stuff
and then the last sentence was.

893
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.600
"But of course.
all the cool kids

894
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.600
were at Secret Garden Party."

895
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.800
We needed to
really identify ourselves

896
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.440
as a bit different and we
did that wholeheartedly

897
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.256
with this sort of idea
that you either think

898
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.256
we're a bunch of wankers or
you think that looks cool.

899
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.880
We didn't really want a
reaction anywhere in between.

900
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.920
- My greatest
moment was the year

901
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.760
that I realized it
wasn't a secret anymore.

902
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.040
I was on the top of
the Ferris wheel.

903
00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:00.160
looking out across
this incredible canopy
of stars below me.

904
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.120
And I cried. you
know. at that moment.

905
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.080
It was just so. so emotional.

906
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.776
- The first time
I went. I thought.

907
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.000
"Hello. It's not a
secret. It's massive."

908
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.920
And I know exactly where it is.

909
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.440
So it's not a Secret
Garden Party at all.

910
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:21.160
It's a massive sore thumb in
the middle of Cambridgeshire.

911
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.640
With planes flying overhead
and like really loud music

912
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.160
and queues for miles
and all the Tesco's

913
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.720
completely empty of beer.

914
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.760
You know. it's not secret.

915
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.360
- I got a text message saying.

916
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.840
"Is it okay. Prince William's
coming to the Garden Party.

917
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.960
He's gonna camp in the Garden."

918
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:48.880
Prince Harry.

919
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.600
- Prince Harry. Thank you.

920
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.640
"No. it's not okay to put
the Prince of the realm

921
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.640
in our Garden when we are
like. have no VIP area."

922
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.680
This is supposed to be. you
know. one tier and shit.

923
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.416
And Daisy. you actually
phoned me up and went.

924
00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.920
"That's really not cool.

925
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.640
Like. he doesn't. you know.
what else does he get to do"

926
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.600
- "Okay. you can
come. but you're not
having a free ticket."

927
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.800
- Well. if he plays the
same game as everyone else.

928
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.560
if we book four or five
lookalikes of Prince Harry.

929
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.720
then not only does he get a
chance of a bit of anonymity.

930
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.360
we have plausible deniability
the whole fucking way.

931
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.880
And telling
their private security

932
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.880
that there's loads
of lookalike on site.

933
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.640
was probably one of the
funnest moments of my life.

934
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.400
- When I was introducing
Jarvis Cocker.

935
00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.760
we had this pact
that Jarvis Cocker

936
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.120
would come to the microphone.

937
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.920
As he got the microphone.
Captain America and I.

938
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.640
would go boooom.

939
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.720
stage dive off the
stage. onto the crowd.

940
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.840
What could possibly go wrong?

941
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.120
So I go and tell
Jarvis Cocker the plan.

942
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.240
He goes. "Brilliant. Do
you want a chocolate?"

943
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.640
So we all had a chocolate.

944
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.640
And then Jarvis Cocker
comes to the microphone.

945
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.720
And I'm looking at my receivers.

946
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.640
thinking like.
eyeballing them to go.

947
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.280
"I'm coming. I'm coming."

948
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.120
I had a few seconds in
which to just sort of

949
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.720
translate to them. the
fact that I was about to

950
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.560
throw myself onto them.

951
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.640
And I sort of got a
few positives and a
few confused looks

952
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.120
but I just went for it anyway.

953
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.840
cause the moment
was. it was there.

954
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.600
So I just launched myself
up and they literally.

955
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.760
it was like the
red. the Red Sea.

956
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.240
parted and just went
peow. like a cartoon.

957
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.280
And I went boom and I collapsed.

958
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.600
almost breaking my
back on one woman

959
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.840
in about her sixties at tie-dye.

960
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.800
She just turns to
me and she goes.

961
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.480
"Oh my God. you're lucky
you didn't kill yourself.

962
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.800
I can't believe the
youngsters these days.

963
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.200
They've got no festival
etiquette at all. have they?"

964
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.680
So she saved me.

965
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.840
Morning guys.

966
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.120
So it's now day two of
Secret Garden party.

967
00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.760
Today. I've got these amazing
trousers on from Penny Drop.

968
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.120
I've got a mesh body suit

969
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.880
and some cool stickers
in little mushroom.

970
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.720
- The kids came up and they
bought their outfit at Topshop.

971
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.320
Sure.

972
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.120
We got it from charity shops
and stapled it together

973
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.680
and painted it blue.

974
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.880
And then just tipped buckets
of glitter on our faces

975
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.800
and rolled around.
getting herpes.

976
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.240
But at least there was
some. you know. there was.

977
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.360
there was a level
of inventiveness.

978
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.160
- We've worked very
hard to get something

979
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.760
that we really
understood what we wanted

980
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.720
as a bunch of people.

981
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.720
Unfortunately. there's
a lot of voyeurs here.

982
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.080
not partaking...

983
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.880
Who are kind of just
here to watch us. right?

984
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.440
It's like. no. fuck off.

985
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.136
I don't want you to watch
me. I want you to be with me.

986
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.720
- And I think it's
gone through lots of.

987
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.160
lots of kind of waves really.

988
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.400
I think the rain and the
mud helped with the phases

989
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.840
because the weather
would be shit all weekend

990
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.000
and all the kind of part-time
party goers would be like.

991
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.360
"Oh no. I've got mud
in my furry boots."

992
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.160
Last night. it rained a lot.

993
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.440
And I mean. a lot.

994
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.856
Music was like pumping
all night. as well.

995
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.320
It was ridiculous.

996
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.520
Gangs of pissed
up blokes wandering around.

997
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.896
getting a bit rowdy
and a bit. you know.

998
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.440
not really in the
spirit of things.

999
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.056
Then word would get out that
that year had been brilliant

1000
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.760
and the next year a load of
assholes would turn up again.

1001
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.080
- When all the Joshua's
and Tiffany's. you know.

1002
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.840
discount themselves on
the. on the greenery.

1003
00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.240
Sipping away on
their Buck's Fizz

1004
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.280
as the sky turned
from blue to pink.

1005
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.680
And then next thing you know.

1006
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.800
it's dubstep and a
man with neck tattoos.

1007
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.920
has a football shirt
that he's holding

1008
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.480
above his head like that and
walking with his shoulders.

1009
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.440
kinda moving back
and forth like this.

1010
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.840
as his mate throws a
cider bottle in a lake.

1011
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360
I'm like. yeah...

1012
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.080
What do I think about this?

1013
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.960
You know. yeah. the
Joshua's and Tiffany's

1014
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.280
sipping Sancerre on the green.

1015
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.400
they were twats but at
least they were polite.

1016
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.976
- The only one thing
that never changes.

1017
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.080
is that everything changes.

1018
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.960
And the reality is if you.

1019
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.880
if you don't accept that.
things can go wrong.

1020
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.200
Any horror stories though?

1021
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.080
- Absolutely not.

1022
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.760
- I remember we had one girl
who was working on our crew.

1023
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.760
She was tripping on
acid and she had found

1024
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.880
a security guards radio.
and she was shoving

1025
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.480
it up her vagina. shouting.
"Fuck me now. Fuck me now."

1026
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.920
And all of our crew
was like. "Whoa! Oh.

1027
00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.040
What do we do with you?"

1028
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.880
And like the security
guard is like.

1029
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.240
"Can I have my radio? I
should maybe keep the radio."

1030
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.920
- One of the wet years.

1031
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.520
Does everyone have stories
about the wet years?

1032
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.200
Oh. God. I better be good then.

1033
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.600
The mud was pretty
crazy a few years ago.

1034
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.120
Really nuts. And it was
worst I've ever seen.

1035
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.240
Didn't the Pagoda Stage sink?

1036
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.440
- Did it?
- Yeah.

1037
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.800
The Pagoda Stage sank?

1038
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.920
- Yeah.

1039
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.040
- Kids in bin bags. stamping
around through just trenches.

1040
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.920
And when you. when rains in
your face the whole time.

1041
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.600
you have to frown. you spend
the whole day frowning.

1042
00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.976
Spend the whole day
frowning. you know?

1043
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Not good.

1044
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.000
- I was doing a stall here and
the field was draining off.

1045
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.120
down through the stalls.

1046
00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.480
So we dug with adjoining
people. a trench.

1047
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.440
And I was sitting
there thinking.

1048
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.720
this is a very. very
middle class festival

1049
00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.960
and I'm not quite sure
how I feel about this.

1050
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.640
And just then. an extremely
pretty young girl came up.

1051
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.920
vomited in our trench
and walked away.

1052
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.800
And I thought. well.
maybe it is a festival.

1053
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.096
- I was always surprised that
it never would dissuade people

1054
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.400
from getting in the mud pit.

1055
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.920
the fact that there was
already mud everywhere.

1056
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.616
- We love it when it
rains at Garden Party

1057
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.160
because we're indoors and
it means that we're packed.

1058
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.160
- They're the real fight.
- They're the bloody fight.

1059
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.160
The battle of the Somme.

1060
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.640
2007. Glade Festival.
was one of the most nuts

1061
00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.960
experiences of my entire life.

1062
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.320
I mean. we had rivers.

1063
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.640
We went to the police and said.

1064
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.840
"We can't keep
everyone safe. Sorry"

1065
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.776
And the police said.
"Well. you can't evacuate

1066
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.920
cause the roads are closed.

1067
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.840
So you've got to
keep everyone safe."

1068
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.440
And that kind of triggered
this Dunkirk spirit.

1069
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.840
Yeah. I mean.
they amount to some very.

1070
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.160
very tough days in the office.

1071
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.816
but you do always end
up quite proud of the.

1072
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.360
the people you're standing
shoulder to shoulder with.

1073
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.160
- It's just that general carnage

1074
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.376
but you're all in it together.

1075
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.320
And you kind of just keep going

1076
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.000
cause what else you gonna do?

1077
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.000
- Garden Party had a lot of
rain as well. but whatever.

1078
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.800
It's nothing compared
to what we had.

1079
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.840
- In Duff's Bar.
in Duff's bar...

1080
00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.120
In Duff's Bar at seven
o'clock in the morning.

1081
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.080
there is a Heras fence

1082
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.680
with blue plastic
draped over it.

1083
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.360
In front of the Heras
fence. in the muddy grass.

1084
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.040
is a paddling pool full
of dirty brown water.

1085
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:28.160
In that paddling pool is an
inflatable champagne bottle.

1086
00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.320
which is just meandering around
slowly in the dirty water.

1087
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.120
under the gray skies
up against the plastic

1088
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.640
on the Heras fence.

1089
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.800
And five men stand around with
their hands in their pockets

1090
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.960
staring at the little
inflatable champagne bottle.

1091
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.200
And I sat there and watched this

1092
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.120
and thought. "Yeah. this is ace"

1093
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.520
There was something almost
Beckett like about this bleak.

1094
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.560
bleak remnants of
something that may have

1095
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.480
one time been spectacular.

1096
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.480
Long washed out. dead.

1097
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.240
Yeah. I fucking loved that.

1098
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.520
Oh. the glare of fresh air.

1099
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
- I remember sitting up on
this tree watching a stage

1100
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.416
and I didn't know
the guy next to me.

1101
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.160
but I just sat there
and I said. "Nice."

1102
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.720
And the guy next
to me said. "Nice."

1103
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.360
And I said. "Nice."

1104
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.320
And he said. "Nice."

1105
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.040
And we had. like went
through 30 different 'nices'.

1106
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.480
It's really funny.

1107
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.216
And then he walks off and I
never talked to him again.

1108
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.720
And then six months
later I met him

1109
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.040
and I realized that was Vito.

1110
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.000
First time I met him. yeah.

1111
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.480
- Oh really?

1112
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.360
- He just loved that lifestyle
of being out with people.

1113
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.320
being fun and energetic.

1114
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.240
- 20 minutes ago. you were
looking like Father Christmas.

1115
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.040
Now you're. you know.
Dr. Seuss or whatever.

1116
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.880
The tragedy was this. you know.

1117
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.160
the ying and the yang.

1118
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.960
He did suffer from depression.

1119
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.640
- We definitely saw eye
to eye on the world.

1120
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.680
- The festival draw
was the party draw.

1121
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.040
the creativity that. you
know. that suspended reality.

1122
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.200
that escapism. drew
him in too much.

1123
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.560
- I knew he was
struggling a little bit

1124
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:49.480
with the festival scene
and I didn't know how much.

1125
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.840
- But you never know. do you?

1126
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.240
Yeah.

1127
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.240
- I was meant to call him.

1128
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.760
And then the week
later I heard the news.

1129
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.840
- Like everyone. we
probably all thought.

1130
01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.376
"Oh God. we should
have said something.

1131
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.200
done something or
gone down or helped."

1132
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.280
It's all very
well if you pronounce

1133
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.200
all these great intentions
under the black light.

1134
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.240
but when the house lights come
on and you need to actually

1135
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.520
follow through and
make all of that real.

1136
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.320
otherwise it's all bullshit.

1137
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.760
- CALM came through Freddie.

1138
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.320
I think until Vito died.

1139
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.720
I had absolutely
no comprehension of
the suicide rates

1140
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.880
in men being quite so high
and quite such an issue.

1141
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.440
The Campaign
Against Living Miserably

1142
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.280
is for us an obvious ally.

1143
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.040
Well. it started with
Eddie Temple-Morris.

1144
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.720
who first mentioned it
and introduced it to me.

1145
01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.600
It fitted our ethos
of responsibility.

1146
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.720
At CALM. we
believe you can't have

1147
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.520
a great festival without tea.

1148
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.960
So come say hi at this
year's Secret Garden Party.

1149
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.160
We started giving them space

1150
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.400
for interactive art pieces
that gave people an opportunity

1151
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.240
to open up. engage. acknowledge
maybe some of the things

1152
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.960
that they carried themselves.

1153
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.480
- 'Well. I'm sorry to say so.

1154
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.480
but sadly it's true that
Bang-ups and Hang-ups.

1155
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.320
well. they can happen to you.'

1156
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.736
- Bizarrely at the
time that he died.

1157
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.440
he was at his strongest.

1158
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.080
Now I know. quite often the
case when someone has made

1159
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.400
that conscious decision.
they're like at their happiest.

1160
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.560
clearest. most cognant stage.

1161
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.360
You need to
take care of each other.

1162
01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.280
- Waiting around for
the phone to ring.

1163
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.200
ding-a-ling. ring-ding-a-ling.

1164
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.600
- One thing I've learnt
is to just try to listen

1165
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.440
a little bit more to that
niggling little voice.

1166
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.760
When someone pops in your head

1167
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.040
a couple of times.
just call them.

1168
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.880
Yeah.

1169
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.400
- Well. you've probably been
told about his firework finale.

1170
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.360
His sister got in touch.

1171
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.480
He'd asked whether his
ashes could be scattered

1172
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.160
at the Garden
Party or some such.

1173
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.360
He suggested
a rather Hunter S. Thompson

1174
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.320
style firework display.

1175
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.160
- Nothing would give
him greater pleasure

1176
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.920
than to know that we'd
done the nearest equivalent

1177
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.160
we possibly could.

1178
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.800
- Seeing Vito's firework
go up. that was great.

1179
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.080
He would've just loved that.

1180
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.600
He would've just loved
the sheer silliness of it.

1181
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.441
of sending someone's ashes up
in a firework and going pew.

1182
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.280
Perfect. Absolutely bang on.

1183
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.560
- I just miss him madly.

1184
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.400
The friendships
that you made here

1185
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.560
would gravitate out
into your real life.

1186
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.480
You wouldn't get
that love like and support

1187
01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.280
and people being that
open anywhere else.

1188
01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.560
You know. I met the
mother of my child here.

1189
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.440
I think we probably made
that child here. I think.

1190
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.560
When you've got
that many people projecting

1191
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.240
that amount of love.
it's very overwhelming.

1192
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.560
- Will you marry me?

1193
01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.320
- Fucking yes!

1194
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.416
The amount of
relationships and friendships

1195
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.360
and businesses and
skills and careers

1196
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.520
that were kind of born here.

1197
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.440
make it like just one of those
really. really special places

1198
01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.600
for a really big
crew of friends.

1199
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.320
- There maybe that
weird kind of. you know.

1200
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.840
naked ping-pong
tent that they made

1201
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.840
becomes like. you know.
takes over the world

1202
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.600
as crazy international business.

1203
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.800
- Secret Garden ending
is a sad chapter.

1204
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.880
- The last dance
and the last party.

1205
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.280
everyone was just crying.

1206
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.600
There will be
people who will remember

1207
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.600
Secret Garden as a place
where they first fell in love.

1208
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.440
There will be people
there who remember it

1209
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.600
for the wild shag that they had.

1210
01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.320
- I've got laid quite a
lot at Secret Garden Party.

1211
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.400
So I've got to thank
it just for that.

1212
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.280
Why are you stopping it?

1213
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.480
Why not keep doing it?

1214
01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.200
One of the
reasons we didn't fight on

1215
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.720
is we never wanted
to be that festival

1216
01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.800
that wasn't as good
as it used to be.

1217
01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.880
We'd always said we'd pull
it if we got to that point.

1218
01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.640
- Secret Garden created a model.

1219
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.600
which I truly believe. if
you look around the world.

1220
01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.280
lots of people are doing now.

1221
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.720
Festivals had a certain format

1222
01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.640
and then Secret
Garden came along

1223
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.240
and that format changed.

1224
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.256
- More and more festivals
are now selling tickets

1225
01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.280
because of the production and
the non-music entertainment.

1226
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.920
rather than those
big headliners.

1227
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.920
That worked until
I think what we were doing

1228
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.320
then became part of the norm.

1229
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.920
But I think times have changed.

1230
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.960
There certainly wasn't Facebook.

1231
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.000
There wasn't YouTube
and then all the rest.

1232
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.800
The currency of how you
presented your life online

1233
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.856
and that being mainly
photos took a massive role

1234
01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.880
in people's lives.

1235
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.840
I think an event like ours
with such a rich backdrop.

1236
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.760
that was certainly
a plus for us.

1237
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.680
but I don't think we credited
that we were losing control

1238
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.720
of how we were
presenting ourselves.

1239
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.400
We were getting accusations
of having sold out.

1240
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.880
It was. you know.
diametrically opposite online.

1241
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.680
People going. "That's
brilliant. We love you guys."

1242
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.280
Or. "That's awful. You're
a bunch of tossers."

1243
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.520
You become a bucket list event.

1244
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.160
A sort of festival
republic machine.

1245
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.000
where you are just trying
to churn out what's popular

1246
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.800
rather than help
create what's popular.

1247
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.680
- This was exactly
the right move.

1248
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.040
Rather than slip into
some kind of obscurity.

1249
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.040
- Yeah. the horse wasn't lame

1250
01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.520
but shoot it anyway.

1251
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.320
The Garden man. long
live the Garden.

1252
01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.640
Going out with a bang

1253
01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.760
was always gonna be preferable.
